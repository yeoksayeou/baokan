<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c17">三國恊定成立以後之歐洲舒) <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>當世界大戰告終。巴黎和平條約慶祝成立之際。而次期之大戰警鐘。卽於此時敲動。歐洲之危機。亦已潛伏於其中矣。世界大戰時。全世界參加者計三十二國。亘四年又四個月之日期。死傷達一千二百萬。戰爭費用一千五百餘億美金。損失之重大。罹禍之慘痛。誠爲人類有史以來空前所未見。當時撫覽戰禍之遺跡。瞻念朱來之人類。誰願再興禍端。重啟戰爭乎。然迄今僅十六年。而法德之間因軍備而頻傳衝突之急激。德奧國境。以尋常爭執而醞釀武力之淸算。歐洲國際間戰雲瀰漫。大有立卽興兵之槪。設非爲經濟條件所制限。軍備競爭。將更有甚於今日者。</p>
<p>中歐糾紛。無論爲奧國獨立問題。爲波蘭走廊問題。皆有法國從中操縱。此爲世所共知。勿待深論。現在走廊問題。暫時擱置。而中歐之奧匈。竟成爲糾紛之核心。意大利乘德國勢力未充實。法國難於插足之際。發揮其外交上之敏腕。以經濟出路誘致奧匈。使伊等突破當前之難關。開闢未來之途徑。自陶爾菲斯與　博斯親赴羅馬之後。三位獨裁宰相聯席恊商。形成一中歐之新局面。在政治上確定奧大利獨立之保障。今後意大利於中歐。將如以往之法闌西以小國爲衛星。而穩定其政治霸權。在經濟上奧匈得到海上通路。當更可俯首聽受意國之指揮。形成以意大利爲中心之三國經濟聯盟今日吾人所應加以研究者。厥爲此三國恊定成立之後。歐洲之影響如何於地中海之影響又將如何也。</p>
<p>奧大利獨立問題。最易引動糾紛者爲德奧關係。在德奧紛爭之中。勢將牽惹法闌西。援助奧國。使德意志無所措手。不料意大利　於形勢危迫。急速積極下手。三國恊定。竟能短期告成。德國限於四圍之環境。對法旣不能無所顧忌。對意大利此種外交上之成果。又無法以破壞之。勢必另籌方法以相應付。故德意之間。將來外交上仍不免有激劇之爭關也。且意國旣爲奧匈之盟主。勢將進而圖支配中歐。法國之霸權。必感受嚴重影響。蓋法意兩國。於維持奧國之獨立。抑制德國之發展。雖有同感。而爭霸之企圖。則萬難調和。此事意國固已償其所欲。而法國對之則不免有所恐懼。此後法意間之鬬争。恐又將轉趨明顯矣。矧多腦河流域小恊約諸國。論歷史因緣。則以割讓匈牙利領土。少數民族迄今紛擾未已。論當前局勢。意國支配亞得利亞海權。致南斯拉夫海路閉塞。難保不巴爾幹半島暫時休歇之火山。又將發燄所謂邀請小恊約。國加入三國恊定者。除非多腦河流域諸國。願聽意國支配。一如奧匈而後可。非然者。又將如何調和之乎。南斯拉夫之欲得亞得利亞之制海權。亦不下於意大利也。法蘭西旣肯作彼有力之背景。焉肯輕於讓步。夫法國之欲制抑意大利過度發展。人所共知。至少應能平分亞得利亞之海權。然後方能控制地中海之利益。保持其在歐洲盟主地位。則又爲意大利所必爭。故三國恊定成立之後。其爭執恐更趨激烈矣。</p>
<p>黑衣宰相旣明白聲言意國必須在非洲尋出路。尤當與亞洲圖合作。其在中歐得手之際。更欲展志於北非。揷足於小亞細亞。而地中海爭霸對手。僅一法國。蓋北非地盤。已爲法意兩國所分割。而特利波里旣甚貧瘠。所有海岸亦不堪開發。惟有借重土尼斯爲港口之一途。然該港在法國保護支配之下。豈容意大利任意在彼發展。而意又天賦極薄。除鼓動愛國熱情。以求向外發展而外。絕無第二途徑。觀夫黑衣宰相之言論。其急欲開拓北非。已溢於詞表。然則三國恊定成立以後。不僅歐洲問題。從此更增複雜的激劇性。且或將延至地中海引長至於北非。亦未可知耳。</p>

<p>（柏林）自意首相墨索里尼星期日之言論發表後、此處半官式之外交評論報、卽載一論文、對於墨氏之論調表示相當之滿意、謂外間各國對於意大利態度之種種揣測、俱可一廓而淸、對於德國重要主權之維持尤屬實事求是、與其素日之原旨不背云、至於三國恊定一事、雖不必過於誇張其重要性、但其所採取之方式實頗與法國所慣用之手段相似、因此種團結甚易於化爲「國與國之連橫專制」、以造成將來之糾紛、因此之故、德國對於此種之連結素來卽不願參加、該約旣稱任何事件發生時、如有一國願互相磋商者、卽須互相磋商云云、但會商地點究在何處、三國之間究以何國之言最爲有力量、亦屬一疑問、惟奥國之人民、百分之百爲德人、而匈牙利復堅持其獨立之態度、將來或不至於發生與二小國利益不相容之傾向、以經濟方面言之、則該約之成就並不謂大、因意大利原有之主張、固在組織一意奧匈三國之關稅聯盟也、該報復謂、德國此後亦正如前十年將益從事於多瑙河諸國經濟組織之改善、且將保護其自身之經濟利益、使不爲單方面有政治目的之企圖者所干涉云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<p>罷工醖釀波及全國紐約進行緊急會議</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國勞資衝突時有爆發之虞、衝突之範圍恐將波及全國、而適當其衝者又爲國家之三主要實業、故羅斯福總統今日與檢察長克朋氏在此間集議、會商對於嚴重時期之意見、因總罷工將不利於政府之復興計畫也、同時實業家領袖則在紐約集會、討論關於鐵路及汽車業之現狀、而舊金山之勞資衝突、調解人員則逆科碼頭搬運夫之罷工將無期封鎖美國西方之航業云、總統與檢察長在白宮之會議歷數小時之久、議畢、外間卽傳說政府於必要時將採取斷然之處置、俾力挽罷工之危局云云、目下除福特公司外、美國其他之著名汽車公司咸推舉代表參加在紐約舉行之會議、該會之目標、在計議如何對付未來之罷工、因罷工者曾發危言、謂將破壞全國之汽車業、使二十五萬人停止工作、並將直接鼓動鐵路業鋼鐵業及煤礦業之工人也、當各實業家正在集會時、國家汽車業工會則聲稱、對於美國總工會無承認之意、亦不願因汽車業工人之故而與總工會締結任何契約、紐約之鐵路當局者已與總工會領袖會晤、然對於工資之爭執尙無進步之可言、鐵路罷工者聲稱、如資方不能讓步、則將使全國運輸停頓云、鐵路代表堅持鐵路員工必須承認現今行使之工資計盡、在今後六個月內、繼續有效、工會發言人對此建議不特加以拒絕、並要求補給前六個月所減去什一工資云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>地特羅　美國汽車業勞資糾紛如不於兩日內解决、或將釀成美國歷史上空前工潮、故汽車業僱主今日再作一度努力、應付工人要求、工人現所反對者爲僱主方面强令工人加入公司工會之主張、全國汽車業商會今日對工人發表一文、謂工人願否將其自己與公司交涉之權、讓與以此爲職業的工黨領袖、工人宜自决之、文中又請工人注意於汽車業近來加給工資减少工時事、美國總工會之代表答稱、俟在汽車廠外由國家復興處監視舉行選舉後、各工人投票贊成加入公司工會、則美國總工會自當退讓云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國各路局經理今日在此開會、决定减資百分十五之辦法、從七月一日起實行、路員則反對甚力、謂工資現已减去什一、受累已甚、若增至百分之十五則愈感困難、路員領袖現有要求照舊减資什一者、路局經理似對於减資新辦法不予實行之提議尙願磋商、此乃一種好氣象、據今晚消息、關於此點之討論、門戶尙未關閉、同時汽車業今日亦在紐約舉行非公開之會議、討論十萬工人揚言罷工事、福特未與會、但國家復興處主任約翰森將軍則參與會議、可見華盛頓當局甚重視引事也、（十九日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c74">朱家驊講新生活運動與敎育 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>京訊、中央黨部今（十九）日上午九時舉行第一百二十二次總理紀念週、到中委葉楚傖朱家驊蕭吉珊洪陸東王陸一陳　君李宗黃克興額白雲梯及中央工作同志共五百餘人、葉委員楚傖主席、行體如儀畢、卽由朱委員家驊作報告、題爲「新生活運動與敎育」、原詞如下、</p>
<p>「首都新生活運動促進會成立的時候、家驊曾將該項運動的意義、詳細說明過、新生活運動是一種民族復興的大運動、牠是發生於民族迫切的要求、來表演時代的精神、牠的基礎是禮義廉恥、以國家歷史的精神爲發動、亦以發揚國家歷史的精神爲使命、要從日常生活做起、推而至於生活全體、要從個人生活做起、推而至於國家生活、要身體力行、以精誠求感化、純粹以自身的修養、造成一種風氣、以復興我們的民族、建設我們的國家、我們除依照這些原則、去實施和推廣我們的運動以外、同時注意到社會上未來人物的新生活、所以敎育問題實與本運動有密切的關係、家驊依據過去的經騐　又因二十年來不曾離開敎育界、所以順便在這裏說幾句、</p>
<p>蔣先生目擊時艱、所以發起此項運動、知道我們民族現在的缺點所在、所以特別注意禮義廉恥四種固有道德的修養、從個人日常生活做起、守禮從整潔做起、明義從守信做起、養廉從儉僕做起、知恥從負責做起、然而現在國人一般生活、何常是如此呢、浪漫頽廢、渙散浮滑、不講禮貌、沒有紀律、沒有秩序、毫沒有責任心、以及貪汚、種種惡德、我想從前敎育的沒有宗旨、沒有政策、沒有辦法、是最大原因之一、近代中國民族的精神、逐漸消沉、到了淸末、受各國的壓迫、幾度掙扎、鑒於義和團的運動、乃是最後的失敗、自此民族自信力完全喪失、以後一切革新運動、事事模仿外國、一味盲從、流弊所及、竟於將中國固有的歷史精神丟得乾乾淨淨、外來的政策制度、不問其是否合於國情、多拿他作救治中國的良方、一切世界主義、無政府主義、共產主義、自由主義等等、弄到結果、把中國的制度文物、整個崩潰、發生一大混亂底局面、因此在此時期所製造出來的靑年、又散到社會裏去、播下多少禍根、損傷了國家多少元氣、這不是已往敎育的罪過麼、</p>
<p>所以本黨在定都南京、開始庶政建設的時候、便根據總理遺敎、首先督促敎育宗旨的確定、站在自己歷史精神上來復興我們民族的精神、當時中山大學會同廣東廣西兩敎育廳　在十七年全國敎育會議席上、捉出確立三民主義之國民敎育、以救國家之危亡案、終得修正通過、敎育宗旨漸得確定於復興民族的一個意義上面、本黨第二屆四中全會、五中全會、三全大會、四全大會、以及國民會議、關於敎育决議案、與夫約法國民敎育章之規定、更不絕地以民族復興爲敎育一貫的宗旨、九一八以後、我們更以這個確定宗旨、求得實施的政策和辦法　政府在此時期、首先發表整理大學的嚴令、裁併大學院系、改進大學內容、整飭學風、注重實科、訂定科學名詞、及取締設備不全　內容腐敗大學的實行、接着將小學以至於大學的組織、作一整個的整理、一面在原有學校制度之外、施行短期義務敎育辦法、使義務敎育易於普遍、而迅速推行、提倡小學兩部制、以節省經費　增多兒童入學的機會、確定中小學的課程標凖、開始陸續編訂中小學以及蒙回藏全套的敎科書、使敎科內容含有歷史精神的材料、注重民族復興、以啓發學生愛國家愛民族、尊重自己歷史精神的心理、更嚴密規定敎員服務的辦法、使養成風紀、這些根據本黨敎育宗旨而實行的政策和辦法、又因本黨第四屆二中全會的各項整理全國敎育的决議案、而增廣其實行的力量、這二三年來敎育部這種整理政</p>
<p>策和辦法正在不斷的進行、雖然有許多障碍、其成效未易速見、但是這種障碍、自然是社會上一般人不甚明瞭民族歷史精神　故凡根據民族歷史精神而建設的敎育政策和制度、因之不易推動、所以次新生活運動、卽在敎育上也有很深切的關係的、</p>
<p>蔣先生這次發起新生活運動、要把整個社會改造來改革一切事業、也要以社會整個力量去推動敎育的改進、以挽救民族的危亡、所以我們提倡新生活運動、應該本着這個宗旨去推動、同時我們要知道新生活運動要從敎育上下工夫、必要使純潔靑年們在染習未深的時候、養成新生活的習慣、</p>
<p>我們這幾年來、在敎育上旣已下了許多復興民族的種子、這許多種子的發芽抽幹長成、全仗全社會力量的推動、就是說社會推動的力量必定在新生活成功以後、是毫無疑義的、因此新生活運動特別是對於敎育上有深切的關係、所以有提出說明的必要」、</p>

<h3 id="c143">怎樣研究東北問題 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>讀書指導部：</p>
<p>貴部是負有指導一切靑年的責任的—不僅指導讀者，而且應該指導對於一切實際問題的解决。所以我特提出這一個已經被人忘記，而又是最主要的問題—東北問題，請貴部提出公開討論。</p>
<p>日本對於東北武力佔領已成過去，現在他開始了「斬草除根」的滅種政策。日本藉着許多手段去實行這種政策，因爲篇幅的限制，我祇能把幾種最毒辣的手段寫在下面。</p>
<p>㈠實行亡國敎育</p>
<p>日本欲使東北三千萬民衆，永久做它的奴隸，第一就是實施奴隸敎育。東北的大中學大部分均被關門，小學也只是半死半活地開着，東北各省敎育廳均設有課程編輯委員會，編亡國敎科書，現在已有多種出版，內容完全是麻醉思想消滅靈魂的東西。各中小學每週均添授日文若干小時，聘日人爲敎員，名爲敎員，實則監督有否反日反滿動作。若是這樣下去，五年十年以後東北靑年不但不知愛國救國，恐將完全日化，忘掉祖國了。</p>
<p>㈡壓迫知識份子</p>
<p>日本對於知識份子，則用「下井投石」進一步的殘酷。事變後，一般知識份子逃亡失踪，被明殺暗殺的日有所聞。日本的便衣偵探佈滿東北各城市，任意到各家去搜索檢查，那怕祇搜着一本雜誌，你也得被誣爲反動，逮捕入獄。於是切書籍都燒得罄凈。一些漏網的知識份子，也都東逃西散，流離失所。剩下的祇是些渾渾噩噩的愚民，日本對於他們又施用種種威脅壓迫，使他們忘掉祖國。立了僞帝國捧上一個傀儡皇帝，去麻醉他們，這些充滿封建思想的愚民，怎能看穿這套四洋景呢？</p>
<p>㈢武力消滅義軍</p>
<p>「九一八」後，東北的義勇軍風起雲湧，幾乎盡人皆軍，無人不勇。滿腔𤍠血，以徒手與械精彈足的日兵周旋。可是現在一個個死掉了。勢力一天天地消滅了，雖尙有一些殘餘，也是氣息奄奄，朝不保夕了。日本爲澈底消滅義軍，各地均駐有勁旅，並令鐵路綫六十里內不准種植高梁稼禾，以防義軍藏身，手段之嚴密可謂無微不至。足致日本死命的義勇軍，恐怕就要被消滅於最近吧！</p>
<p>㈣實行毒化政策</p>
<p>日本欲使東北三千萬民衆永久爲日人之奴隸，乃實行毒化政策。逼令各地强迫種植鴉片。一般農民則以「九一八」事變以來，農村破產，一厥不振，爲求衣食計，亦不暇顧及利害，均已後事競爭種植。種植的面積聞已佔耕地百分之十左右，種植卽已官准，吸食自然公開，東北各大都市均有烟館千家以上。每烟館內僱</p>
<p>有女招待侍候烟客，外僱有流氓「拉客，」各街頭巷尾均有「烟大味好」「女招待漂亮」一類呼聲。日本爲實行「烟色迷人」手段，乃明准烟館公開留宿烟客，儼同妓館。一般靑年不迷烟者亦迷於色，終日一榻橫陳，短笛順吹，志氣日愈消沉，身體日愈　弱。日本卽僅以此毒政策，已足以制我東北三千萬同胞之死命而有餘矣！可不痛哉！</p>
<p>根據以上幾種毒辣手段看來，日本已經下了滅亡東北的最大决心。我們爲保持「國土完整，」理應和他拚個你死我活，但是事實適得其反。我們祇看見香檳交歡，傀儡登極，不問且體的抗日國案，至於民衆又怎樣呢？回想「九一八」的時候，全國鼎沸民衆激昂到了極點「抗日救國」的呼聲，喊得震天價響，罷工罷市請願募捐，大有「一砲打平三鬼島，痛飲黃龍酒一杯」的氣槪。鬧得沒有幾天，偃旗息鼓，一轉昇平氣象，影院劇塲時告客滿，一張影片可以連映一月以上，而又塲塲擁擠，可謂猗歟盛哉！高等華人日則高而夫，夜則狐步舞，分明是「國泰民安」那有「國難」模樣。政府這樣塞責，民氣這樣消沉，前途還堪設想嗎！</p>
<p>編者先生們：我不忍心去看國不抵抗而破，家無代價而亡，我更不忍心去聽水深火𤍠的三千萬同胞痛心的呼號。我要拿我的整個生命，一腔𤍠血，糾合同志去拯救東北，工把它做我終身不失的職業，一步不放鬆地幹去。我現在要埋頭澈底地杷東北問題先研究一下，做爲將來幹的南針。但是東北問題不是個簡單的問題！它的爆發不是偶然的。我知識的欠缺和能力薄弱都使我對於這個問題爲難。然而我志已决，不能因爲難，挫去它的分毫。敢請貴部成我之志，助我一臂，詳細地指導給我一條研究的門徑才好，我在懇切地等着你們的答復。（東北難民方覺夢來函）</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>▼蘇子美竟日待金魚</p>
<p>.▼蘇東坡以得見南屛金鯽魚爲榮</p>
<p>近人數見不鮮的金魚，在宋以前是沒人頑的，唐人官銜，雖有「賜紫金魚袋」的番號，但是，掛在腰裏的紫金魚袋，不過和玉魚金龜等佩物，同是一種「彰君之寵」的意思，和現在所玩的金魚絕對不同。</p>
<p>現在的金魚，三歲孩童都認識；古人却不然了。北宋時代的蘇子美和蘇東坡，誰都推爲博雅君子；誰知，他們見了金鯽魚，宛比土老兒邀遊上海灘，大有「見所未見」的模樣。蘇子美甚至於要見金魚，在橋邊恭候了竟日；蘇東坡在四十年後，讀了蘇子美「沿橋待金鯽、竟日獨遲留，」這兩句詩，對於金鯽兩個字，很有些莫名其妙。後來，他到了子美吟詩的地方——六和塔寺，見了池中有金色的魚，才知道這金鯽兩字的來歷。東坡歡喜的了不得，非但，在東坡詩話中叙述此事；而且他又有一句得意的詩，呌做：「我識南屛金鯽魚。」現代三歲孩童都認識的東西，蘇東坡却詠諸篇章，得以一識爲榮，這是時代爲之，不能笑他少見多怪的。</p>
<p>紀識金魚的書籍，都說：「人家蓄養金魚、從南宋以後才盛行的。」所以，北宋人對於金魚的認識，總有些稱奇道怪。蘇子美第一個欣賞金魚，後四十餘年，乃有蘇東坡繼起：除却二蘇以外，要在北宋人裏面，尋幾首吟詠金魚的詩，這是很難很難。</p>
<p>金魚園，也是三百六十行之一，有了行業，便該有崇奉的祖師；我想，蘇子美儘可做得金魚業的開山祖師，其他，配享人物，鬍子伯伯蘇東坡大槪是不祧的了。</p>
<h3 id="c146">從虹橋飛機塲歸來 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 南海沙鷗</p>
<p>「天廚號命名典禮」，「月輝號飛機授受儀式」，「成隊飛機表演」，這些大字標題，激動了上海廣大羣衆的好奇心理。一時虹橋道上汽車，脚踏車，人力車，步行者，捲起黃塵，　擁而來。我也是其中的一個。</p>
<p>這天的天氣是大有春意，人也似乎大發了春興。飛機塲上攔著繩子的左半面，那新近建築而尙未竣工的機冪附近，早已萬頭攢動了。十四架飛機一字陣排列着，天廚正號驅逐機——裝置着機關</p>
<p>搶的——副號敎導機，和「月輝」「月文」四機便排在中間，正對着臨時設備的蓆蓋的禮廳。</p>
<p>三點鐘敲過，一聲軍樂，台上的要⾓們，——贈機者，受機者，政府代表，航空恊會·航校，飛行社等等的職員，——接着照例的演說，台上未設播音機，所講的話，五步以外，可以相信是沒有方法聽淸楚的。好在觀衆的目的是要看飛機表演。聳人聽聞的演詞，儘由新聞記者去負責記錄。</p>
<p>由軍樂隊的移向「天廚號」機身附近，知道是在那裏擲瓶了。在這一霎那間，飛機塲的東北⾓忽然由星星之火，在經冬未割的茅草上蔓廷燃燒開來，西南風吹着，一刻兒便成了燎原之勢，武裝的警士們連吹警笛，大家把外衣摜着努力撲熄，風烈草乾，火燄如蛇吞似地直向東北面進襲，迫得另一部人們迅速將停在那邊歐亞三四等號飛機移開，得免於災。若是人手稍乏，動作稍緩，那頃刻之間，便有好幾架飛機奉敬於「回祿之神」了。——飛機塲上滿地的芳草，簡直是危險品，一個遺棄的香烟頭會變做一枚炸彈！</p>
<p>飛機頭上的旋翼——推進機，　　地轉動起來了，轟轟的巨聲震盪了全塲觀衆的耳鼓，空氣頓時緊張起來，「月文」號首先凌空而上，翩翩地打了幾個迴旋，接着是「天廚」驅逐機的升空表演，忽而疾落，忽而冲　，幾個空心觔斗，博得全塲高呌。結末是航校機師們駕着「滬市號」，「滬商」，「滬工」，「滬校」，「滬童軍」等六機列陣齊飛，迴旋雲表。虹橋道上的黃塵中又魚貫的疾馳着觀衆的歸車。</p>

<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>並不是在下，提筆起來就說錢，可是像這勢利的現代社會，一切的一切，都是非錢不行，非錢莫辦，自從上古物物交換時期，而進爲貨幣交換，錢幣就成爲萬事萬物的嚆矢，不論何人，不可一日無此君，你有了錢，人家都趨奉你，歡迎你，你的地位不高而自高了！倘若沒錢，縱然你是正直君子，也給人家瞧不起！有錢和沒錢比起來，大有天壤之別，從前某詩人有詠錢詩，「有能使鬼推磨轉，無卽呼兄亦不來」之句，正是慨乎言之，在下掇拾關於錢財的諺語，以博一粲。</p>
<p>財不露白。財多身弱。人爲財死。要錢不要命。財帛動人心。看在銅錢面上。財跟有錢的走。一兩黃金四兩福。人靠銅錢魚靠水。千里爲官只爲財。有了千錢想萬錢。有錢當思無錢日。橫財不富命窮人。只要銅錢多寶塔抬過河。百勿錯千有理萬無一失。貧在街頭無人問富在</p>

<p>寶芳接着道：我和團長，研究這附近的地裏來實地觀察一回，知道這小小一個堡上有大關係的，最好是先派一團人在這裏駐守候，應當加到一旅人。但是在現在，營房給養問題，只好先調一營人來。師長對我這種計畫所以趁那天大風沙，就把我們調了來了。四位已問問，是不是個漢子？我實芳敢說這句話，八歲，沒有作過獃種！說着，他右手緊緊的捏手心裏，連連搥了幾拳。又道：你們也對我說說咱們東北軍是不抵抗軍隊，氣得牙都咬碎了有什麼用？你產東北軍，東北可失守了，你長沒法兒把這事實改變過來。是的，東北是失守軍三十萬人，是不是全是不抵抗的，這件事情一下子。他說到這裏，臉色緊綳着還紅了起來聽了這話，想起一年以來，人前，人後，所聽，也就紅了臉。寶芳繼續着道：當軍人需要榮生命，我們能忍受這種恥辱嗎？我們以前沒有洗刷我們是不抵抗軍隊。現在我們的機會來了北軍人掙一口氣，同時，還要替中國人掙一口人說，中國不是沒有人，你沒有碰着。現在他究竟中國有沒有人呢？這就在乎咱們能不能告芳敢，我能！你們呢（三四一）</p>

<p>— 傅冀之</p>
<p>晚飲後，精神感覺到有點疲勞，拿着一枝捲烟橫躺在槳上抽，烟霧裊裊地上升，曲折地又給微風吹向窗外逸去，大慨還在下着細雨鉛管裏的水都都地在奏着幽長而淸脆的調子，窗外是暗沉沉的，在這樣的一個春雨連綿的晚上，與其說寗靜，毋寗說是凄淸，尤其是像那沾染到「世紀病」（Mａｌａｄｙ　ｏｆ　ｔｈｅCｅｎｔｕｒｙ）的羅曼諦克作家的心情似的我，更感到無限的虛空和抑　！</p>
<p>幾幾乎要燒到指頭了，便手摔在地下；身子仍舊懶洋洋地不願搬動。我在沉思：我覺得我不該有這種頽廢的傾向而該向着趣味的，有意義的人生方面去活動；雖然我這所謂趣味的，有意義的人生觀，像是帶有個人享樂主義的色彩。</p>
<p>那周圍的紅木書架上，無論燙金的，線裝的，文藝的，學術的書籍都有，歡喜看的時候，便抽出一兩本躺在彈性十足的沙發上來翻閱，一壁抽着那歡喜抽的捲烟；雨前，雀舌，人橫豎會選好泡來的，這不是很逍遙自在嗎？</p>
<p>圍牆外，垂柳下，是一灣澄淸澈底的淺溪，心情恬淡時，便搖着畫舫瀏覽沿岸站着的雜樹和野花；或者聽其船隨水流，自己摹倣着那長髮的詩人，蹲在船當中自斟酒自高歌，似乎也很有意義的吧？</p>
<p>如果那率眞無僞的農夫們肯和我攀談的話，我可以箕踞在碧油油田塍上聽他們講那義皇以上的縹渺的故事；或是獨自坐在桃林下看那絢爛的落花片片的隨着無言的流水流到那遠不復見的處向去；再不然，我也可以乘備自備的奧斯汀馳向繁華𤍠鬧的都市去住個三五天，換換那快要厭倦的空氣，這也是很足以自樂的富有人生意味的生活呵！</p>
<p>然而，事實給予我證明，這完全是一個不能實現的烏托邦·醒來吧！</p>

<p>每年到了七八九月間，在別處正當溽署的夏季，在尼斯却是永遠和暖明媚的春天，旅囊充實的男男女女，從歐洲各大都會裏溜出來，都到「碧藍海岸」的尼斯，過一個快樂的署期。藍的海水，藍的天穹，藍的車輛，藍的眼睛，藍的寶石戒指，在黃金色的沙灘上，舉行盛大的展覽會。</p>
<p>夏天在尼斯，永久是風和日麗的睛天，從不會降落半顆雨點，旅客們儘可以優閑地飽嘗海景和太陽光浴的樂趣。到了黃昏，淸風徐來，處處是溫柔的感覺。一個人靜悄悄地獨坐在地中海濱冥思，或携了情侶爬越阿爾卑山，或者休憇松柏橄欖樹影下披覽小說，或者擠在快樂嬉笑的靑年男女隊伍裏歡呼唱歌，多麼自由逍遙的生活吓！</p>
<p>在尼斯，每年有許多名目的節假，是歡舞狂歌的日子。在一九三三年的夏季，前後共舉行了三個月的節假慶祝。現在把各種節假的名目日期抄在下面，以見當時盛况的一斑。（七月二日）地中海宮舉行電影節，（九日兒童球戲日（十三日）亞爾培王公園Lｏｉｅ　Fｕｌｌｅｒ舞會，（十四日）法國國慶節街頭跳舞大放烟火，（二十日）國際航空旅行節，（廿三日）摩托脚踏車競賽，（廿九日）Cｏｒｓｏ　Bｌａｎｃ夜舞會，（三十日）海上競技戲，（八月四日）阿爾卑山國際汽車競賽，（六日尼斯汽車比賽日，（十日）至二十七日，浴裝美女選舉，（十三日）在古墟劇塲表演著名戲劇，（二十日）至二十三日法意兩國比賽拳術，（廿七日）足球比賽水球比賽，（九月二日）至三日海龍王節，（七日）美國脚踏車會，（十日）歐洲脚踏車賽會，（十七日）公園夜宴會，（廿四日）葡萄收穫節全城遊行跳舞。</p>
<p>每到冬天春天，尼斯的假節比夏天更形活躍，現在根據一九三四年份預定的節假日歷，略舉重要的節目如下：（一月六日）哥爾夫球戲，（十五日）至二十一日尼斯網球錦賽，（二十日）皇家旅館哥爾夫球戲，（廿一日）茲善有奘舞會，（廿三日）法國婦女紅十字會遊藝會，（二十七日）榮譽勳位會舞會（二月一日）嘉年華會開幕，（三日）法國救濟傷兵會舞會（四月嘉年華遊行會，（六日）海上競舟水戰戲，（八日）擲花節，（八日）至二十五尼斯第十屆市集展覽，（十日）「黃金草」與「紅實石」舞會，（十一日）民衆跳舞會，（十二日）至十八日法國南方網球錦標賽，（十三日）法國婦女節，（廿二日）擲花節，（廿二日）至廿四日哥爾夫球戲是月幷舉行滑冰錦標賽。（三月二日）「尼斯之夜」盛宴舞會，（三日）哥爾夫球戲，（八日）擲花節，（八日至十日）尼斯哥爾夫球錦標賽，（十日）白色舞會，（十一日）賽狗節，（十二日）至十八日草地網球錦標賽，（廿一日）至廿八日國際帆艇比賽，（廿五日）孩童擲花節賽鴿節，（卅一日）至四月四日法國外省慶節，（四月一日）至二日國際航空競賽，（七日）至十一日農產水產展覽會，（八日）尼斯遊行節，（十六日）運動跳舞會，（廿一日）法國軍官舞會（三十日）至五月六日「碧藍海岸」草地網球錦標賽。</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初軟　穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、較前日小一二角左右、故開價後、市氣依然平定、較前日回小半分左右、迫後因大廠仍無出檔、一部份或有拉進、並以市塲之投機多頭、仍陸續吸收、致人心步定、喊價亦步俏、迫至下午開盤、以市塲浮多、仍有抬貿、廠家亦收回近期、故人心曾見步俏、小廠方面、近期亦有收回、遠期則套出不少、北路客帮、有進有出、惟出數較買進爲多、照目下情形、完全爲人心所抬住、事實上則客銷並未大暢也、結果本月份較前日好一分七厘半、四月份好一分二厘半、五六月份好一分、七月份好一分半、八月份好一分七厘半云、</p>

<p>— 袁澈</p>
<p>以前聽見德國丘八雷馬克，放下槍桿，搖起筆來，竟能著一震動世界文壇的大作「西線無戰事」，不禁爲之吃了一驚。隨後讀格萊塞的「一九○二年級」，才恍然領悟，雷馬克之上戰場也，大約也與一般的德國靑年一樣，行軍袋裏是放過文學名著的。而且德國的敎育，我相信，自小學以至中學，關於方學方面的注意，絕對不像中國這樣的馬馬虎虎，產生一兩個雷馬克，原是很平常的事情。</p>
<p>在中國，目前經過各樣生活的靑年，無疑是多多又多多的，然而終不曾產生一部偉大的作品者，很顯著的原因，自然第一是沒有受過好的敎育。而且卽使受過好的敎育，他們去當兵去做工或是在生活途中掙扎的時候，衣袋裏却一定沒有裝過文學名著的，因爲根本上也就並無什麼名著可帶。所以，與其要拿「現在沒有偉大的創作」來責難正在努力寫作的作家，倒不如罵一頓未會留有許多偉大創作的前人吧。</p>
<p>不過現在中國的創作，幸好藉了外國遺產的帮助，究竟是在一天一天地發榮滋長着的。說到這裏，我們這一批不十分懂外國文字而又在尋求外國遺產以從事習作的靑年，是不能不感謝近十年來的翻譯家的。所以目前我倒並不怎樣希冀偉大的創作產生，却是很𤍠烈地盼望多翻譯一些外國的文學名著過來。</p>
<p>我們是缺乏母乳的嬰兒，而且常常啼飢號寒於陋巷之中呵！</p>

<p>— 沈淪</p>
<p>鎭江現在是江蘇的省會。省會該有省會的特點。那寬曠的馬路，那像脫了絃的箭一般的汽車，便是省會的特點麼？不是的。省會的特點該是數千扣證章的公務人員！！那些挾着黑皮包上衙門的大小官兒。</p>
<p>大衙門集中於城內中山路一帶。中山路雖有十六公尺闊，但汽車往來者不多；除難得的營業汽車外，就祇有寥寥可數的大衙門中的「官車」了。所以，有許多頭腦不靈淸的小市民咕噥個不住，以爲化費了那樣多的人力和物力開闢馬路，實際上受益的僅是極少數的特殊階級！而且官家向來缺少錢，因了闢馬路而「勒限拆遷」的房屋，原有每間十元的貼費，到如今尙有「掛在賬上」者。</p>
<p>鎭江雖在長江以南，人民的習氣，風俗，以及語言，生活等，却都江北化。小脚婦人在這里是同在北方一樣毫不以爲奇的。江北人有「忍苦耐勞」的美德，這是大家知道的。鎭江與興化揚州高郵如臯等縣僅一江之隔，所以一切比較勞苦的工作，如拉黃包車，搬運苦力等均爲江北帮包辦了去。本地人大都出外經商，像江北人飄一只艒艒船出去旅行覓食一樣會「忍苦耐勞」，京滬路一帶上海蘇州等處，鎭江人在商界的勢力可也不小。他們離家鄕的時候，大都只有一個鋪蓋，一只網籃。而回來時，說不定會帶上成千成百的洋錢。因爲鎭江人對於積蓄金錢有一種特長，化一個大錢也得掂上三回的。因此本地人貧苦者固多，但小康之家亦不少。生活程度城內較城外高。一因交通上的距離關係；二則城內多一批「非本地人」的住家。物料（如房屋食物等）求過於供，遂生高下了。</p>
<p>本地人稱呼女佣人，一律爲「高媽」；而「小大姐」則爲「簾子」，這兩個名詞頗費解，卽本地人亦不知其何所取義。農村破產後，「高媽」與「簾子」頓多，用一個簾子祇須每月八角至一元的工資。「高媽」的工資致多每月二元。工次雖微，飯總是可以吃飽的；比較在沒落的農村中等着餓死要好得多了　　在鎭江要找一個摩登女性，委實是一件難事。縱然有時碰得到皮大衣高跟鞋的「海化」女人，她的口音一定不是本地的，而是那些大小官兒的眷屬。本地人卽使是有錢人家的千金小姐，在冬天也多綁脚管，穿棉旗袍；皮大衣與高跟鞋是絕小絕少的。</p>
<p>這城市，新得不澈底。舊得太含糊，大槪是和中國內地許多省會差不多的。</p>

<p>— 宇文宙</p>
<p>近些日子，文壇上又了生了一件不幸的事情，就是關於「何家槐和徐轉蓬的小說不淸不楚」的事情。一方面首先就加以絕對的否認，一方面又開出了一個貨數俱載的淸單，而且「仗義直言」的人更用的是「爲親者諱」的春秋筆法，像這樣至今還是不淸不楚的事情，也許會永遠都不淸不楚吧。到將來，我想不是一造名利雙收便是兩造都作犧牲而讓承審的大老爺落得一個威名，大約對於一般的文壇終歸是沒有什麼好的賜予的。而事情之所以被稱爲不幸，主要的也就在此。</p>
<p>因爲事情究竟還是不淸不楚（雖然已經有了侍桁先生底「萬不得已」的「公開」和徐轉蓬先生底「無可如何」的「自白」，但還沒有見着何家槐先生底「舉出證據」的「聲明」和「辯護」），在局外人自然是個判斷的。好在事情尙未了息，待以後被公開得淸淸楚楚了再說吧。不過，「事到如此」，却不能不使我們發生幾點感想：</p>
<p>第一，前幾年我們曾經在報上見着有一位史什麼先生專門偸稿的新聞，被偸者是郁達夫先生等，隨後又聽說有一位在讀賣市塲上享着盛名的戀愛小說專家用賤價收買別人底稿子署上自己底名字賣大價，最近更從許多文章上得知有些人專門請許多廉價的秘書爲自己譯書或著書以圖名利雙收，這簡直已經成了一種非常流行的無恥的風氣（自然這風氣很容易毒害一個新作家，我們是非加以掃蕩不可的）。據徐轉蓬先生底自白：『他（指何家槐）因爲認識徐志摩的關係，到上海不久文章便有了出路，有時他急於要錢交費付房租買飯票，但手頭沒有現存的文章可以換錢，便拿了我的文章去。』從此我們可以測到那種事情是可能的。譬如說，一篇文章先署徐轉蓬的名字不得發表，旣拿回來發表在別的雜誌上便變成了何家槐的名字，而且自以爲會曉得的編輯先生却並不曉得，就是搆成這種可能的原因之一。爲了掃蕩這種無恥的風氣，我以爲有澈底澄淸的必要，否則將會蹈入一般盜案的覆轍。據說在上海這地方，包探破案往往是將那些先有招呼應酬的大盜和正犯縱容了去而只捉幾個從犯的小偸來做做榜樣給失主看看以邀得上司底賞賜和社會底贊許，我却希望明敏的批評家們不要陷於作包探的嫌疑！</p>
<p>第二，徐轉蓬先生說得很好：『那「罪過」和錯誤」，我和家槐都該承認的。我們已經做錯了事，只希望以後不再發生類似的事情就好了。』雖然在局外人看來，徐轉蓬先生對於這種「罪過」和「錯誤」是很容易承認的（因爲這反而可以使自己名利雙收），然而我們仍不能不敬重這種坦白的表現，只是我們更希望徐轉蓬先生再多給我們一點坦白的事實。單就侍桁先生底文章看來，首先就使人知道還有一部分「未經轉蓬許可，現在不便披露」的事實被侍桁先生掩藏着了，而且據侍桁先生底叙述，轉蓬先生想把文章收回還是由於朋友們底慫恿，到了進行的時候又猶豫起來，彷彿頗有難言之隱的樣子，何况徐轉蓬先生自身亦說過「局外人很難明白家槐的苦衷和我們苦衷的」呢，這都是使人不能不懷疑到徐轉蓬先生所有的坦白底程度的　　第三，何家槐和徐轉蓬兩位先生底不淸不楚的事情是應該弄淸楚的，無論就整個文壇或他們底前途着想都是應該弄淸楚的。但，這需要一般人底公正的心和好的批評家底度量。侍桁先生始而加以追問和探訪，繼而又只是向別人傳說，並不加以舉發和指摘，終於却爲了一個不便宣佈的化名負起責任而將所知的事實公開，並於日銷數十萬份的報紙上公開宣揚之後還在聲明自己是萬不得已才不得不如是而勸別人不要將事情宣揚出去更爲人所不齒，這已經失了一個批評家底度量了。同時，又與自己底友人淸道夫先生異口同聲地極端稱贊徐轉蓬先生底文章而對於應該由雙方負責的行爲只下些片面的過早的斷語，如果再將侍桁先生近來對於徐轉蓬先生的一切批評聯起來看，那是很不容易使人看出侍桁先生底公正的心的。不久以前，有些小刋物上還曾經攻擊過何家槐先生有某種傾向，而那種傾向又正是侍桁先生素來所攻擊的目標，爲了批評家底命運，侍桁先生至少應該不要使人想到自己底仗義直言却有爲了友人以上的並非爲了文壇的意味和作用才好。</p>
<p>至於何家槐先生底「罪過」和「錯誤」，雖然只有待何家槐先生本人底「承認」或「詭辯」出來以後再說，但不妨先行忠告幾句：何先生還是一位很有前途的新作家，應該有承認自已底「錯誤」和「罪過」的勇氣和决心，將一切事實坦坦白白地公布出來，從各方接受一切批評乃至責罵的敎訓，向着一個很有希望的方向努力，否則不但將爲人所不齒，而且就連自身也不得救了。</p>

<p>哥不息的把我所不需要的書籍往我的書箱裏扔。他放進，我拿出，一會兒他又放在我的箱裏了。他似乎覺得這都是我平常看的書應該帶了去。但他怎能知道我現在不需要這些；而我自己也怎能知道，將來會需要這些呢？</p>
<p>蘭和母親再三的叮囑我保養身體，吃得好，睡得早。然而誰又能知道愛健康的人偏偏容易生病，而不愛健康的人却反而長壽呢？</p>

<p>我因此也希望我的旅途平安，希望我遇到高興的事。</p>
<p>二、滬平車中</p>
<p>一走進車箱，就彷彿到了北平似的。通車上的茶房幾乎全說着流利的諧和的北平話。這樣純粹的話，算起來已有七八年沒有聽到了。牠使我感到愉快和信任。雖然還在上海，却像到了直爽而誠實的北國。</p>
<p>車要開了，我忽然記起剛纔電報上寫錯了日子。自已下去，趕不回來，便問茶房可有辦法。「你寫了紙條，我托他去，他是我們自己人，掃車的，决不會錯！」</p>
<p>我絕對的相信，他不會錯，雖然他並不會再見到我。倘若是南方人，我可得懷疑。</p>
<p>車慢慢地動了，快了。代表那夜的上海的燈光，漸漸疏淡，冷落起來，我們不久就在黑暗裏疾馳着。</p>
<p>老葉不息的坦白地唸他的詩給我聽。他眞是一個大孩子。他使我覺得我自己老了。十年以前，我正和他差不多，有什麼說什麼，但現在却老是沉默了。我不願意讓別人知道我的歷史和生活，思想和感覺。我懂得了生活的技術。</p>
<p>他說他的孩子聽不到鳥呌，他爲孩子憂愁。這眞是一件値得悲傷的事。我的孩子也這樣。許多孩子也正這樣。做父母的人常以爲都市的學校比鄕村的學校辦得好，自己愛都市，也便把孩子帶到都市來。却不知道都市的學校除了幾間堂皇的校舍以外，並沒有什麼。卽使幸而眞的辦得好，沒有自然的環境陶養孩子，也是可悲的。（未完）</p>

<p>因爲要使她自己不再有所藉口，好安心坐下來寫她已經計畫好了的文章，依娜昨天幾乎頑到了天明才回家。可是，到了現在，雖然逼着她的母親和弟妹們回到了他們自己的房間，而且已把烟，茶，紙，筆，等安置在桌上，她還是不能使自己的心安靜下來，甚至，她還不能使自己坐下那桌前的椅上。</p>
<p>「要再不寫，怎麼得了！」她警告着自己。</p>
<p>可是她依舊在徘徊着，不肯讓她的身體坐下去，彷彿那椅墊是蜂窩，她一坐下去就會被　似地。</p>
<p>「怎麼在一個星期日的晚上，竟便得一個人都不打電話來？」那早在她潛意識中的思念現在已不再是潛意識了。—是的，她在希冀什麼人，無論什麼人，打給她一個約她出去的電話，使她可以得到一個解救。</p>
<p>「開始工作的日子會選到一個星期日，多蠢！」她在開始責怪自己。「別人不打電話來，我自己不好去打電話給別人？好的，還是今天再頑一晚，明天一定開始寫。」</p>
<p>於是她决定去打電話，而且在她向電話話機走去的時候，她已想定了一個她所要打去的對象</p>
<p>「是宋公館？—請你們三小姐聽電話。—你是蕙羣？—我是依娜。—我在家裏。是的，我只有一個人。—我正想約你出去。—聽你說。—大華？—哦，大滬，好的。—先到先等。—在裏面的門口。」</p>
<p>先到大滬的是依娜。等了不久，她看見來了蕭頌塵和侯子九。</p>
<p>「哦，陳小姐。你一個人？在等冶初？」子九先說。</p>
<p>依娜搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「那末，冶初已來了？」頌塵補充着。</p>
<p>「不；我不知道，」依娜說。「我是在等蕙羣。」</p>
<p>「我們一起到裏邊去等如何？」頌塵向她提議。</p>

<p>— 宸</p>
<p>東北四省鐵騎的奔馳，淞滬砲彈的轟炸，曾一度震醒中國朝野醉生夢死的沈酣，高喊着忍辱負重，臥薪嘗膽，　食宵衣以資號召，倒也一時雷厲風行，像煞有介事；可惜這一呼聲，終未能發聾震瞆，一挽頽風，跟着日本砲聲的遠去也就闐然無聞，甚至絕滅了。只須睜眼一看，電影院跳舞塲藝塲大舞臺幾乎是空前未有的興盛，大飯店大酒樓，歌臺舞榭，依然是萬家歌舞，遍地管絃，那裏有一點國難外患的表徵，簡直純全是唐虞盛世的太平景象！</p>
<p>但是生於憂患，死於宴安，何况當此「危亡無日」，「禍變紛乘」之時，因之一部份「惕勵憂勤，寢饋難安」的長官，也因之抱移風易俗之「宏願」，以「滌蕩舊汚」「振刷精神」而「整躬率物」了，邇來傳聞河南開封各機關，厲行「黎明運動」，軍政長官每日天明早操一小時，繼復舉行專門之學術講授，主席出巡孟津對縣長公務員訓話也以相誥誡；魯省韓靑天三令五申，提倡「朝氣」軍事委員委亦於本月二日重申前令：（命令從略）若照這道命令看來，已經集中國社會陋習的大成，純粹過着極度荒淫頹糜的生活。有的是與天竺姑娘「嬰粟」結了不解之綠，成天陶醉在烟雲薄霧中過活，淸燈一盞，一榻橫陳，其晝伏夜動陰陽倒置的情况，到是三分像人七分似鬼的骷髏。有的賭博性成，或則麻雀四圈，或則呼盧喝雉，摴蒱作戲，在這大都市的跑狗塲，回力球塲，大賭窟更是他們的去處。而一般獵艷追逐有「寡人之疾」者，早就成了走馬章　的「熟客」，許多花國紅人也將官僚政客看作「極表歡迎」的入幕賓。至若三日一小宴五日一大宴，以當東用做「聯絡感情」以謀取進身之階的人，尤爲比比皆是。這一病態的現象，誠如所去，實際上已成「習爲固然」的事實，牠乃「有志於政治者」必須具有的條件，缺乏這些技能大有「休想官塲中混」之形勢。</p>
<p>這些陋習其直接的表現，僅爲凡事遷延，廢時廢事，然而在其影響之下，形成政治的腐敗，魚肉黎民，致國家民族於衰敗死亡之途。</p>
<p>不過這一特殊現象的產生，自有其經濟的背景，牠不僅在某一界裏發生，而且是普遍於某階一層。因此牠的根本剷除，將不是少數領袖的「整躬率物」便能「滌蕩舊汚」，非把牠互爲因果的經濟制度改不能消滅。</p>
<h3 id="c212">Lａｄｉｅｓ　ａｎｄ　Gｅｎｔｌｍｅｎ「卽高貴的人們」公演觀感 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 高原</p>
<p>首先我們不能不敬佩靑年會智育部諸君的𤍠心提倡戲劇，經過如「幕前致辭」裏所說的那許多選擇脚本，排演的因難，最後還是能把「高貴的人們」這樣新的脚本公演，使我們飽了眼福，並且「一方面更深望觀者能引起研究戲劇之興趣，而踴躍參加，俾得組成一戲劇研究會，」希望這次公演能進一步達到這個目的，使劇運的陣營裏，又多一支强有力的生力軍，那我們是該多麼高興的！</p>
<p>據作者說，高貴的人們的脚本是當「原稿寫在臘紙上」的那種怱忙中寫成的，然而結果並不因爲「怱忙」而脚本有多大的缺點，從舞台上所得到的印象，這一劇本是相當成功的。</p>
<p>在三幕劇中所展開的故事，不能不算是相當的複雜，一個工廠主的家庭，廠務以及整個高貴社會層的生活，工業界金融界在目前國內外之經濟的，政治的內在矛盾底下動搖情形，工廠中的工人鬥爭等等，作者都處理得相當週到，而不現得堆積，嚕囌，各種情形都以很簡短的對話和動作來表現了、這種處理題材的經濟手腕，是這一脚本所以成功的第一原因。</p>
<p>劇中人物的性格描寫也已够顯明，只有廠主周振華還嫌不充分。或者說相當不妥，値得商量的。一個五十一幾的中國工業巨頭，雖說他年老了，工廠的破產，是政治的經濟的恐慌，爲個人力量所不能挽救的，但是我以爲他不應該是「連自己怎樣發財的，」「兒子是甚麼時候生下來的」也不知道的人，這樣一來，會使觀衆看到他的工業破產還是他自己的不能幹，不善經營，這是很有可能的，這一點，不知作者以爲如何。</p>
<p>此外，抽大烟唸觀音的周太太，跟秘書私奔的姨太太，上流社會裏風頭最健的交際花他女兒周麗英，都很顯明。勾引姨太太私逃的秘書，和逼債的債主，他們的性格表現，似乎要稍次一點，至於王媽和汽車夫一開幕，就用他們躱在屛風後面吻抱的曖昧行爲來介紹用人們的生活，是很有趣而又特色的，每一塲的開幕閉幕都很自然緊凑，第二幕開幕時，介紹奶媽的家庭狀况而引起姨太太的怒罵，等借主不來而來了債主；答應以財產抵押而又遇着工潮；姨太太私逃了，大太太一手拿着燒烟的烟泡出來咒罵；而借欵未到手，借主又因爲標金投機的失敗而自殺了；這些都是緊張而能抓住觀衆情緒的地方。</p>
<p>全劇相當的曝露了高貴人們的不可救藥的腐臭生活，中國民族工業的破產，金融資本主義社會裏的經濟恐慌，上流社會裏男女的「金肉」關係，以及另一個新的社會勢力的起來。</p>
<p>正因爲上述的意義，假設工潮的發生在全劇最後，我以爲或者要緊張些，更重大些。雖然工潮發生了，而周老爺還想只要借欵到手，答應工人的要求，工廠仍舊不生問題，一直等到借主標金投機失敗自殺以從，他才沒有最後的辦法，這裏有著作者取輕避重的影子。</p>
<p>佈景燈光，看樣子，是用了一些功夫的，不過第一幕（第三幕同）的佈景似乎表現出一個古舊的家庭，不能充分代表一個大資本家的住室，當然中國的民族資本家是帶有封建的氣份的，而且周太太還是唸佛的，不過全景都充滿了封建家庭的氣象，是側重舊的方面了。</p>
<p>此外，第二幕的石膏像，是裝飾用的，太暗淡了一些，第三幕的電話機，王媽拿出來的時候很淸楚的看出是輕輕地紙做的一樣，底下是木黃色的；抱在懷裏的孩子也輕輕地，演員沒有愼重的處理牠；小孩哭聲和汽車喇叭的呌聲的效果並不肖像眞的，不過，這些都是小地方。</p>
<p>編劇導演都盡了很大的力量。演員柳蔭，周道，紅荳，表演都很成功，只柳蔭的化裝還不够老年，周伯勳的化裝似乎更油膩血腥一點，服裝再華貴點，更能充實他資本家的性格，第一幕裏現得窮愁潦倒的樣子，是相當的减少效果的。金山的秘書，還沒有充分現出他那勾引姨太太私逃而在廠主面前又如何巴結廠主的那種本領，沙白的債主也還沒</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>有盡逼債的能事，我想這與演員的性格有關係，其餘麗蘋的奶媽聲音稍低了點，國語有少數地方欠淸亮，不過因爲她愁苦的性格，這些還無多防害，遺棄的王媽，卓見超的汽車夫都可以。我很遺憾，只看了第一天的第一塲，以後幾塲我想一定要進步得多了。全體看來，這一劇的演出是相當成功的，許多應獲得效果的地方，並沒有溜過去。我們在這裏可以看到中國民族工業前途的暗淡，和不可挽救的經濟恐慌，和上層社會的腐爛生活，編劇導演和演員都是很努力的。（完）</p>

<p>— 逸</p>
<p>死，平凡的死，一個小動物被殘殺的死。</p>
<p>這死，縱使臨到某一人身上，也未必會駕乎「平風」之上或「偉大」之下的，而現在，則僅僅是一隻貓的死。</p>
<p>這貓，一隻流浪街頭的貓，一身黑斑紋的毛皮裏住牠瘦弱的肢體，四條細小的腿連着個平癟的肚子，顯係是個常不能飽腹的動物。牠在繞了垃圾桶旁嗅着扒着時，我看見過；夜裏，躱在簷沿下閉着眼的時候，我也看見過，但是，每當我走過或迫近牠身時牠總是玄刻逃得離我遠遠後，站住了回過頭來望着我。牠會呌，我聽見過，和別的貓一樣，就是聲音微弱些；尤其是，有人給牠東西吃時，會呌出一種感激的聲調來。—牠會這此，僅僅只會這些，那是太懦弱！牠不能拖活雞吃，不能偸金魚吃，活該要瘦弱得如此！</p>
<p>但是，也好，這小動物的命運有了轉機，—好像也有一個可以過些安逸日子的時期。那是因爲一位和我同住一屋的老婦人，看牠餓得可憐就收養了牠於是，現在的牠已由流浪的生活轉入於優遊的生活：想吃時，有現成預備好的白飯等牠去飽腹；想睡時，有爲牠特設的安樂窩。多幸運！這小動物的身子有了歸宿。</p>
<p>「人類畢竟是偉大仁慈！」牠現在應該這樣想：「上帝啊！我感謝你，感謝你在這宇宙內降生了人類！」眞的，牠將快活極了，比從前活潑了好多。我有時也用手去撫了牠，牠不再像從前地害怕而逃避我了，還昂起了頭呌幾聲。看牠的樣子，似乎很滿意着目前的生活。　　時光是一天一天地向前飛着，這小動物身上的毛，漸漸地發出光澤，身體也慢慢地肥大起來。無疑的，目前的生活，顯示已影響了到牠的生理上。　　這裏，我絕對沒有想到過：這優遊的生活後，竟有伏着斷送這小動物的危機！</p>
<p>那位天天給牠飯吃的老婦人，大槪爲什麼事離了家到一個地方去，一個多月沒有回來。這小動物的食與住，非惟無人來理會，並且隨卽被驅逐了出去。原因是牠太會把屎和尿到處拉開來。</p>
<p>從此後，垃圾桶旁與簷沿下遂常有牠的足跡。牠依然嗅着，扒着，身蹬着，眼閉着和從前一樣，沒有怨恨。牠非但不怨恨，還能不忘却一度是過他的家。所以牠還是常常來，不間斷地唻。終於人們對牠引起了極厭惡的心：下次再看見牠來，打斷牠的腿。</p>
<p>小動物總是小動物，牠沒有理智，更不知道人情善變。在某一個上午跑了來，終於送牠自己的命。</p>
<p>事情總有個原因，在那個上午，人們發現了煨在鍋裏的一只雞缺少了一爿，推測後，斷定是那隻貓吃去的。於是罪名就此判定，只等執行。</p>
<p>捉隻貓當然是極容易的，在牠跑來的時候卽被擒住。接着二根繩子，縛住了牠的四條腿，一個人抓住了牠的尾巴往門外提。</p>
<p>「眞要處死牠嗎？」我終於發問了。　　這人沒有回答我，提了這被縳住的小動物往外就走。一忽兒，一陣棒打的聲響傳到了我的耳裏。</p>
<p>「死了」這人回來說。</p>
<p>「…………」</p>
<p>啊！平凡的死，僅僅是一個小動物</p>
<p>被殘殺的死。</p>

<p>编者先生：</p>
<p>茲有敝友一事，請卽於收信後，在業餘信箱中裁答，因鄙人行將離滬，而敝友的事情又恐有變化，故請先生極力帮忙，不特敝友感謝，卽鄙人亦甚感激，匆此卽請</p>
<p>撰安　　　　　　　　綠梅謹上</p>
<p>所問之事，書之於左：</p>
<p>敝友吳女士，在S女學唸書，她是生長在一個貴族非常守舊的家庭內，去年夏天，她父親的一位朋友，替他作媒，據說對方是非常富有，但是家庭却非常的複雜，是大家庭，有姨太太的。吳女士因鑒於女子出嫁後，往往不如意，願意獨身，當她父親告訴她有人替她說親時，她就反對，但是她的父親不管，依舊進行這婚事。當約定正式介紹的那一天，吳女士忽然病了，不能去，她父親大爲震怒，後來有親戚們的勸告，她的父親稍爲好些，問吳婦士自己到底願意這婚事否？她回答：「我願意獨身」。她父親道。「女子獨身是靠不住的，並且將來父母死後靠誰？」她父親是萬萬不讓她出外去作事的，以爲有失門面，並對別人說；我這女兒無論發如何要嫁她出去的。」然而，吳女士極力的反對着，當時她的母親也不讚成，對方是紈袴子弟，又是守舊不堪的人家，所以她母親也不願她女兒去吃這舊式人家做媳婦的苦處。後來因爲極力反抗，居然把這婚事辭去。但是她父親氣得很，從此就不甚理踩她，對待她比傍人不如，並且她父親因此時常不適，她父親看見她就生氣。吳女士看見父親變成這個樣子，眞難受，她想失去了最親愛的父母之愛，做人有甚味兒。她因爲種種心事，累得她在校內讀書也退步，然而她頑固父親依舊不理她，她天天暗泣，後悔不當違拗父親的意志，父親是要她非嫁不可的。要是順從父親意志吧，這一家她實在不願去，並且在進行婚事的時候，有種種不吉的預兆，加之現在已拒絕後，不能再有機會挽回，她現在所處精神上的痛苦，非筆墨所能形容，又擔着這不孝的罪名。她說：她有時眞恨得情願自殺，但她又不敢，因爲如果她自殺了，她家的親戚又要議論紛紛，何况她家又是社會上的有名之家。所以她現在自已摧殘自己的身子，希望早死。但是她仍極希望重得到她父親的歡心，千思萬想，後來决定：卽然父親一定要她出嫁，就不如嫁到父親所滿意的那家去，種種不吉利的預兆她也可不管。但是她是女子，如何敢說這話呢？况且媒人是父親的朋友，又不熟識，如果她去要求重提這親事，她父親知道了，恐怕更是火上澆油，要大大發努的—恨她有失體面。她處在這種情形之下，實在無法可解决她的問題，須請高明的　編者先生替她指示一條明路給她。她現在不希望別的，祇希求得她父親歡心，和她自已一種精神上的安慰，她就滿足了。求先生敎她。</p>
<p>答：令友吳女士的父親如此頑固，這種人眞是無理可喩，然而令友爲了要重得到她父親的歡心，竟願「不管」自己，摧殘自己，這種孝心固極可佩服，但太不顧到自己了。爲了旁人犧牲自己，原無不可，何况是自己最親愛的父親，但是我們却要先論一論値不値得去犧牲，須値得的，有意義的，纔去做，不値得的無意義的也去做，未免太愚。婚姻本是各人自己的事情，婚姻的美滿與否，也是自己的事，旁人可說毫無關係，原無干涉之權利；雖則中國仍保存大家庭制度，但不論是誰總不能贊成包辦婚姻，不許自由戀愛，因此，他的反對父親爲她定婚是極正當的事，她的父親恨他反對，要發皮氣，却是糊塗透頂，完　全不顧盧到女兒的心理，她的願望，所以編者認爲，她對於她父親之不滿意，原用不着自己感覺到不安，自認不孝，更不必勉强屈服自己的意志「嫁到那家去。」當然，在可能範圍內，也自應以各種方法，希望重得到她父親的歡心，但他種方法都不奏效，祇有這個辦法纔行時，依然萬萬不能用這個辦法。須知違拗了父親的意志固然要負「不孝之名」自己心上也過意不去，但是將來過人不淑，與丈夫或其家庭不能融洽，恐「精神上的痛苦，」仍「非筆墨所能形容」吧！做人也仍無味兒吧！</p>
<p>總之，她父親發努是咎由自取，氣得毫無道理，做兒女的是無曲從他的意志的必要，假如他能設身處地，從女兒的地位着想，恐怕也要後悔，不當違拗子女的意志罷，然而這祇是我們的理想對於他我們是不應有這樣期望的。</p>
<p>最後，我們認爲她的一條「明路」是以後心理上應當有一個轉變，就是「自已的事自已决定。」她應當去謀職業，去選擇配偶，不必再去顧盧一切庸俗的體面和議論類的東西。當然，這並非勸她一意孤行，剛愎自用，我們祇是希望她自己能够憑着理性做事。　　編者</p>

<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>「英弟，正是你！」來客的語氣，像發見了什麼大秘密似的驚奇。</p>
<p>那末熟識的聲音和姿勢，我不好意思地唔了一聲蹩過床邊扭亮了電燈，來客微笑的注視着我，我不信不別而行的表姊袁文還是昔年的那般活潑態度。</p>
<p>「文姊，意料不到啊！」</p>
<p>「意料不到？」她旋過身去，在寫字檯橫頭坐了。</p>
<p>我歸到原位上，授給她一枝烟，兩人交換了視綫，似乎已沒有話可再說。玻璃窗上的雨聲，還是像音樂那般的響着，我却沒有那般領略的餘閒了，整理</p>
<p>「英弟，你幾時到杭州的？」她老是微笑地說着。</p>
<p>「去年冬天。」淡淡的回答了。</p>
<p>「一別二年了吧？」她仰起頭來似乎計算着「我是去年夏天進××校的，無聊得勁，擔任了音樂主任。今天中午時天氣那般好，（想不到現在下雨了。）我被幾個朋友拖着遊湖，在岳王墳畔碰到你的同事：」她頓住了，送過一個莫明其妙的媚笑「他們老是追隨着說不三不四的話，最後他們講起今天要是朱英來了，懶蟲恐怕也要起勁起來哩。</p>
<p>「英弟，眞想不到你會到杭州來！」她微笑的結束了她的自述。</p>
<p>對於這位突然的來客文姊，或者爲了我們往昔的糾紛關係，起初我覺得侷促不安。現在聽她坦白的叙述來意，在我整天煩惱的時光，我就像拉到一個朋友一樣的和她談起來。</p>
<p>「去年秋天，我害了病。自已借的一角房屋，旣不便於休養，就遷進了醫院「說到這裏我不免笑了起來「志琳却每天纏繞着我，我沒有辦法，接受了朋友的勸告，到此地來擔任了每週十二小時的英文，一半也爲了可以休養。居住下來之後，懶得搬動了。」</p>
<p>「懶蟲，哈哈……」表姊的態度𠬆毫沒有更變，老實不客氣地笑了起來。我也免强地隨和着笑，她忽然正經地問我：</p>
<p>「英弟，你知道志琳和誰結婚了？」</p>
<p>我搖搖頭。我眞怕聽見她們兩個人的名字，現在因爲在反常的心理狀態下，和一個比較可以談談的人就無所謂地談起來；她反而認眞的談起志琳來。我預防她再談起什麼什麼來，在烟罐中抽出兩枝捲烟，一枝授給她，燃了火吸烟。</p>
<p>「你或者要認爲一個驚人的故事吧？英弟……」她故作驚人之筆後，悠閑地抽起烟來。她似乎在等我動口啓問；然而我沒有被她感動，至多是志琳的一件秘密被她抓到了。她見我沒有動問，終於說了，態度顯得更正經，「她和李健結婚了！」</p>
<p>她一字一字的說着，我一字一字的聽了進去—她！和！李！健！！結！婚了！</p>

<h3 id="c219">愛斯基摩人在好萊塢的逸聞嶲語（上） <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 廣道</p>
<p>日前在大光明放映的一張「愛斯基摩」（Eｋｉｍｏ），是幾年之中，很難得遇見的一張好片子，可以說是張膾炙人口，同聲稱頌的鉅片。記者偶然的在舊雜誌裏，看見了有一段關於這些愛斯基摩人，在好萊塢的趣事，覺得很有興味，現在把它譯了出來以饗讀者，諒不至有明日黃花之感也。不過在未入本文前，可以先談談這種愛斯基摩人的來源，和他們的生活習慣等等。</p>
<p>愛斯基摩人，係居住在美洲極北，北極的拉勃拉都（Lａｂｒａｄｏｒ），格林蘭（Gｒｅｅｎｌａｎｄ）和阿拉斯加（Aｌａｓｋａ）等地的一種土人，亞洲極北，在波林海附近，亦有這種土人。這個Eｓｋｉｍｏ的名稱，本來是美洲的紅人（Aｍｅｒｉｃａｎ　Iｎｄｉａｎｓ），替他們起的，它的意思就是「吃生肉的人。」由此我們可以知道，美洲的未開化的土著紅人，還比這種愛斯基摩人，要知識進化些哩。至於愛斯基摩人自己相稱，是呌音諾伊脫（Iｎｎｕｉｔ）的，它的意思就是「人民」。這種人因爲幾千萬年處於北極極寒的地方。體格不能像溫帶人種那樣發達，所以却是很矮小的，但是因爲他們又要和天然環境奮鬥，以圖生存的緣故，他們却又極强壯。所以「短小精悍」四個字，用來描寫他們，倒是確切不移的。他們一年四季，因爲沒有農產物，所以全恃光光漁獵爲生。肉是生吃的，冬天沒有鮮肉的時候，他們就拿出平日所貯藏的乾肉啃着，所以他們的齒力，是着實可驚的。他們獵得野獸之後，吃了肉，皮晒乾了就縫作衣服穿。他們住的地方，夏天是在皮製的賬蓬裏，冬天是在石頭或冰塊砌成的圓式的洞穴裏，進出留一個小洞，其狹小繞可以容一個人。那種房子，差不多一半是在地底下的，一來可以借些地下的暖氣，二來還可以防避大風的吹倒房屋。這種人大槪是蒙古種，所以面貌和我們亞洲人很相像，但是他們的來源，歷史家還沒有確定。有的說他們是由歐洲北部遷居而來。但是歐洲北部却又沒有這種人的影跡。</p>
<p>「愛斯基摩」那張片子，除掉了漁獵，狂風大雪等等景幕，是在北極拍攝者外，其餘在好萊塢的亦有一大部份。那位導演范達克，將那幾位演員從那冰地雪地之中運到了董風拂拂，烈日炎炎的加利福尼亞。他們日常生活上種種的不慣，和他們的孤陋寡聞，使他們鬧出許多笑話來；但是同時他們思想的淳樸合手自然，和他們的不會謊言或恭維，却又給與好萊塢的「文明人」一種富有迴味的批評和勸告。我們現在可以拉雜地將那些事情記下來。</p>
<p>他們一到好萊塢，剛下火車的時候，那裏有一位女明星手裏抱着一隻德國種的小狗。那位專門獵海馬的喀末蘇克看見了，就對着范達克哈哈笑道；「那隻小海馬，怎麼生了腿了？」他們看見了美國的女子，他們說：「美國的女子，顏色太白了；身體太瘦了；到了北極是要凍死的。」　對於吃的東西，他們說：「吃的東西太糟了。這些東西太軟。牙齒會吃壞的。」還有一個人說：「你們美國地方的聲音太多了。一切太快了。那種放汽的撬，在街上走得太快。」還有一個人說：「你們這裏太陽太多。晒得人皮　像海狗似的。　　（未完）</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c220">評「舞宮春夢」 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 杏樵</p>
<p>「舞宮春夢」故事很平凡，但是牠的演出是極動人，可以說是成功之作。</p>
<p>以舞塲爲背景，描寫舞女生活的痛苦，隱示着都市的罪惡和社會的黑暗，抓住了人們的心理，給現在的婦女們暗示了人生的途徑，使舞女們明白了做舞女是怎樣的一種身分，是怎樣的一種生活，而給現在的一般舞女一個重大的敎訓。編劇的寓意是不差。</p>
<p>導演手腕還靈活，整個的畫面上很少疵點。不過有一個地方，也許是導演疏忽了一些，就是當趙玉泉冒名蔡曉峯，在舞廳樓上的旅館裏開了一個房間的時候。在觀衆的眼光裏，恐怕都以爲蔡曉峯是正病在醫院裏的時候，决不會到舞廳裏來開房間，李曼曼也决不會相信有這一回事的。因爲這時的畫面是不能知道曉峯的病是好了，同時曼曼所穿的衣服和鞋子，是當她在醫院裏看護曉峯的時候，舞塲經理來通知她，呌她上舞廳所帶來給她穿的，這正像是當她重入舞塲的第一天所有的事。畫面上卽沒有示明這時曼曼重入舞塲已經好些日子，曉峯的病也已經好了，又沒把曼曼的衣服和鞋子更換一下，以表明這是又過了好些日子的事：自然觀衆是要誤會的了。（缺章却酬）</p>
<h3 id="c221">能合之者亦能離之 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 復西</p>
<p>好萊塢的天氣作怪？</p>
<p>好萊塢是特另醖釀羅曼斯的地方。</p>
<p>這或者是因爲天氣的緣故。亦或者是因爲電影勢力所薰染的緣故。但亦許是因爲那些做電影的人……那些演員們，導演們，編劇者，和製片商人等等……大半都是一般年紀輕的，羅曼的克的，冒險的，富有磁性的人們。不過無論它是什麼勢力，它卽能醖釀促成羅曼斯，同時它亦同樣地將卽成的羅曼斯打破了毀滅了。</p>
<p>卽以愛理𠬆德（Aｌｉｃｅ　Wｈｉｔｅ）和雪尼巴脫萊德（Lｉｄｎｅｙ　Bａｒｔｌｅｔｔ），兩人的婚姻而論，亦可以說是盡極悲觀離合之致了。雪尼巴脫萊德向愛理𠬆懷德求婚之久，共有五年。其間受盡各方的破壞，但是破壞終究沒有成功，而他們竟在墨西哥舉行了盛大的婚禮。愛理𠬆爲了要嫁給巴脫萊德，竟情願放棄了她的明星的地位。公司方面的勸告，她竟置之不理，朋友方面的忠言，她亦一槪沒有聽見，就是因爲她認定巴脫萊德是千萬人中，惟一可愛的男子。她這種堅决不移的愛，亦可以使一般靑年男子佩服的了。</p>
<p>愛理𠬆合同滿了，公司方面就沒有和她繼續。這樣她明星的地位，眞的斷送了。但是她心不甘服，她和巴脫萊德二人，恊力同心，組織了一個跳舞團，在美國全國表演着。巴脫萊德亦鞠躬盡瘁地帮助着她，重新建樹他的聲名。這樣他們夫婦二人，堅决奮鬥了一年半，而愛理𠬆懷德的名字，已經膾炙人口，聲名藉藉了。於是他們一天回到好萊塢，去恢復她從前的地位。</p>
<p>愛理𠬆的重返好萊塢，居然轟動了一時，而她明星的地位，亦居然被她重新抓到手了—因爲她已和環球公司訂了一張長期合同。但是，這好萊塢的天氣或是電影勢力作怪了……近來外面盛傳着，愛理𠬆懷德和雪尼巴脫萊德，已經意見不和了。愛理𠬆是常和一位別的男子出去，而巴脫萊德呢，亦常和一位別的女子在一起。聽說他們不久就在離婚了。</p>
<h3 id="c222">愛里歐特來華攝長江影片 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>好萊塢的製片者，在過去已攝製了不少侮辱華人的影片，雖經國人的屢次反對，但製片家所抱對華態度，依然如此。　米高美攝製大地的問題，還未解决，而攝製恐怖影片的製片的愛理歐特Cｌｙｄ　E　Eｌｌｉｏｔｔ又有來華攝製長江影片的消息。在他們出發之前，所定的計劃便是：</p>
<p>外景：以長江爲中心，用山川農村爲陪襯。對象：長江潮汎，疫病，海盜。故事：描寫長江一帶的農民生活，和長江的潮汎，疫病的風行，海盜的猖獗。演員；除自已帶來者以外，希望有五六百華人參加。</p>
<p>就上面的所定計劃之中，倘然是確實的，那麼無疑的又是一張辱國的影片。其目的無非在指謫中國人的無法防止江潮，暴露農民的不知衛生，以致疫病盛行，和海盜到處猖獗，社會不寗的弱點，已非常的明顯。這個問題，希望政府與國人，注意其發展的狀態，誠然如此我們自然應拒絕拍攝。</p>

<p>「體育皇后」拍完了浴室的戲的隔一天，孫瑜導演又來一塲宿舍的玩意兒。太陽從東山探頭出來張大他的血紅眼睛望進競華學校的宿舍時，裏面成行成列的鐵床上正躺着無數健美的女體育健兒在舉行床上的晨操：運動她們的手臂大腿。雖然她們都是袒胸露臂，穿的是短</p>
<p>袂中衣，但是孫導演的手法决不會令人起了什麼異感，祇能够使人覺得這是嚴肅而正確的需要，也許要自慚自己的荏弱。不過話應該說轉來，這景色雖然不肉感却是很美感的，演員的姿勢，鏡頭的角度，光綫的設施……都非常考究。當手臂大腿齊齊地堅起來時，一排一排地整齊一致，或是交織成種種圖案，眞是令人愛覩不忍旁瞬呢。</p>

<p>— 素梅</p>
<p>凱塞琳看著他像有愛火在燃燒的雙目，但是自己的態度，却像冰似的冷。她說：「請你不必爲我担憂吧。這幾年來，我亦明白了俄國所需要於我的，是什麼樣人，所以我亦定規了决不離開這裏。」亞萊克賽懇求着她道：「讓我來帮帮你的忙中吧！」可是凱塞琳搖着頭道：「我不用你帮忙。我自己會打我自己的主意的。」她說完了，就伸出手來給他吻着，而離開他了。</p>
<p>在下面的廣廳裏，來了一陣脚步的聲音。大公彼得帶領了一小隊的兵，正走過來，他們將凱塞琳攔住了去路。彼得突然地號令着兵士道；「預備……描凖……」他忽然又對着凱塞琳，好像剛纔沒有看見似的說道；呦！我怎麼沒有看見你……多好的一個槍靶子呀！」他於是先將兵士遣散了，然後走近了凱塞琳的身旁，低低兒說道：「你到我寢室裏來，我替你介紹一個不認識的人，他想在此久居哩。」凱塞琳聽了他的話，亳不遲疑地跟他跑到他的寢室裏。在那裏，她看見各處擺着許多玩具。在一個小木塊上，那裏有一個凱塞琳的雛型。大公舉起刀來，一揮將它的頭砍了下來。彼得像瘋魔似的笑着道：「你不知道這種玩意兒，我覺得再痛快沒有的了。他於是又將一個小門拉開了，他鞠着躬，伊麗莎白進來了。凱塞琳很隨便的和她招呼了一下，說道：「女皇要是聽見你回來了，一定會很喜歡的。」彼得說道：「她是不會知道的，除非你去告訴她，不過我給你的勸告是，還是不去告訴的好。」凱塞琳哼了一聲說首：「我去告訴？眞是做夢都做不到的事。她自有她的一班秘密偵探。並且你所喜歡的，我亦不來干涉你，祇要你不來干涉我的事好了。」伊麗莎白掀起了鼻子說道：「讓我趁早告訴你吧。等到那老蝙蝠死了，彼得就和我結婚了……當然現在的大公夫人，是要除掉的！」凱塞琳假裝沒有聽見伊麗莎白的話似的，將那馬追馬的玩意兒旋轉着。她笑着向彼得道：「彼得，你還玩這個玩意兒嗎？你玩你意玩意兒，我亦玩着我的玩意兒」她說着，就走了。彼得等凱塞琳走了，又舉起刀來，一刀挿進了另外一個塞琳雛形的胸膛。</p>
<p>女沙皇眞的死了。靈停在大廣廳裏，四面有荘嚴的兵士看守着。在女沙皇的棺材上，蹲着一隻鸚鵡和一隻猴子。彼得已經卽了位，稱爲全俄的沙皇。皇宮裏四面煽起了陰謀和反陰謀的火焰。凱塞琳又在檢閱着兵，對於年輕的官長，又頒賜了許多新的恩寵。國家和敎會雙方的掌權人，每天都舉行着重要的會議。有一天亞萊克賽又來秘密求見凱塞琳。他說：「皇后陛下，你比往日，更覺得美麗無倫了。」皇后笑了。他說：「你眞的還那樣喜歡我嗎？」（未完）</p>

<p>Paid Respects at the Mausoleum of the Premier Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Ambassador Jardine Matheson believes that with the expiration of the Sino-British commercial treaty, there must be appropriate transitional measures for commerce between the two countries before a new treaty is signed. In addition, there have been recent disputes over the Burmese border. The Chinese side believes that Ban Hong is Chinese territory, and the British suddenly started mining, and a protest was raised. In addition, there are some minor unresolved cases between China and Britain, and it is necessary to take advantage of the current opportunity in Nanjing to initially exchange views. The British ambassador originally intended to go to Beiping first to review the case files and then try to resolve each case. Now, because he has also received government orders, instructing him to proceed as appropriate, he has temporarily postponed his trip and will exchange views on the proposals with our foreign affairs authorities first. It is heard that the British ambassador hopes that our side will present a concrete plan for the renewal of the treaty, and he prepares to return to the embassy in Beiping to study it in detail and then telegraph the British government for instructions. As for the Ban Hong mining case, he hopes that our side will have a concrete investigation report, and then try to discuss with the two countries the date of dispatching personnel to survey the border and the candidates for the survey. Eddington, the secretary of the British ambassador, said that the British ambassador has rescheduled his trip to Shanghai on the 26th. During this week, he will try his best to negotiate the unresolved cases and at the same time telegraph the British government for instructions on the direction of resolving the various unresolved cases. It is heard that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared for the progress of this negotiation through the European and American Department, and then Vice Minister Xu Mo and others will exchange views with the British side on each case. The British ambassador will stay in Shanghai for four or five days after going to Shanghai on the 26th, and then take his family to Beiping via Nanjing and come to Nanjing again for detailed negotiations.

<p>With the Purpose of Luring Young Women, Five People Arrested, Remaining Members Fled</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin French Municipal Council cracked a secret agency of the Rose Party. The agency was located in the White Rose Barber Shop on Huazhong Road in the French Concession. The members were all young men and women, and there were many rules and regulations. The purpose was to lure young women to be trafficked to other places, and they were not allowed to develop true love with the other party. Party members used anti-leather long gloves as identification. The party leaders were Chen Zhaoming, a college student who had not graduated, and Wang Shenghu, a martial arts performer nicknamed "Little Lu Bu". The reason for the crackdown was that Chen recently abducted a woman and sold her to Shenyang. The woman escaped back to Tianjin and accused him. The French Municipal Council cracked the case and arrested Chen, Wang, and five others. The White Rose Barber Shop was sealed off, and all the remaining members fled. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Tangshan Police Are Heavily Guarded. The Generator in the Mine Has Been Repaired. Workers Propose Four Demands to the Mine</p>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Government Decides to Establish a Labor-Management Affairs Supervision Office in the Luanyu District. Tao Shangming Gets to Handle the Labor Unrest Conveniently</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 19th, the Tangshan Public Security Bureau armed police protected more than ten workers from the Qixin Cement Plant to repair the generator in the mine. The whole city was lit up in the evening. However, workers clashed with the police, resulting in several casualties. The momentum was very high, and they declared that they would set fire to various mines, walls, and public security bureau buildings. Therefore, all traffic entrances and wooden fences in the city were closed, and the war zone security team cooperated with armed police to guard them. The main gate of the Public Security Bureau was still tightly closed, and many people were guarding the roof. The situation was extremely tense. Today, the Department of Industry received a report that the workers were planning to contact the workers in the four mines of Linxi, Majiagou, Guye, and Zhaogezhuang to expand the labor unrest. More than 50 worker representatives had gone there. Xu Huidong, a cadre of the Hebei Provincial Party Department, arrived in Tianjin on the 20th to discuss ways to quell the labor unrest with Kailuan and Hebei officials. On the evening of the 19th, some workers who did not agree with the strike sent representatives to Tianjin to ask the Mining Bureau to quickly negotiate with the government on a plan to quell the unrest, saying that the workers did not want to continue the strike for a long time and reduce their income. There are more than 300 people with communist backgrounds among the strikers, and they have organized a disciplinary team, which will force all workers to act in unison with weapons. Today, the Hebei Provincial Government passed a resolution at its regular meeting to establish a Luanyu District Labor-Management Affairs Supervision Office, with its office in Tangshan, and Tao Shangming will serve as the director concurrently. The Hebei Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and the Luanyu Commissioner's Office will each send two people to work in the office to handle Luanyu labor unrest expediently. Tao Shangming sent someone to the Department of Industry this afternoon to discuss methods to quell the Tangshan labor unrest. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the Kailuan Mining Unrest occurred, the workers proposed four demands to the mine: (1) payment of 40 days of "shock money" during the previous period of idleness; (2) when the work rate increases, the bonus must also increase proportionally; (3) out-of-town workers should also be entitled to the preferential coal purchase quota once a month, and there should be no discrimination in treatment compared to local workers; (4) an increase of eight cents in wages per ton. This was expressed by the foreman to the mine, and has not yet been formally proposed. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kailuan Mining Bureau received a report that more than 300 striking workers surrounded the mine shaft with weapons on the morning of the 19th, prohibiting workers inside the shaft from going out, blocking the air ducts, and throwing firebrands down to burn to death the four engineers, hundreds of workers, and dozens of security team members who were working in the mine. The workers and police in the shaft shouted for help. Zhao Xun, the director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, heard the report and sent the mine area security team to persuade the striking workers to leave with armed real bullets. They did not listen. In order to save the engineers, workers, and police in the shaft, the police clashed with the workers. Some workers fired guns, and the police also fired back to defend themselves, and a mixed battle ensued. After several advances and retreats in the conflict, the workers retreated. A total of three workers, including Hu Zhenhai and Yang, were killed, and four people, including Wu Yusheng, Hu Binzhao, Du Shun, and Zhao Wanshun, were seriously injured. One rickshaw puller and one hawker were injured. Three policemen, including Wang Huanrong, were injured. Afterwards, the people in the shaft were rescued. The striking workers, having suffered casualties, confronted the Public Security Bureau. From the morning of the 19th, the workers surrounded the Public Security Bureau and had not left by the morning of the 20th. Food and drink were delivered by other workers. Bao Yingqin and Huang Fu telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government this afternoon to make proper arrangements to ensure that the labor unrest is quelled and that no accidents occur. This Tangshan labor unrest was only manipulated by a small number of people with communist involvement, coercing other workers to strike. Therefore, most workers are opposed to the strike. On the 20th, representatives came to Tianjin to ask the Mining Department to quickly find a way to quell the unrest and resume work. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Europe After the Establishment of the Three-Nation Agreement <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>When the World War came to an end and the Treaty of Paris was celebrated, the alarm bell for the next war was already ringing at this time. The crisis in Europe was also lurking within it. During the World War, a total of 32 countries participated worldwide, lasting for four years and four months, with 12 million dead and wounded. The cost of the war was more than 150 billion U.S. dollars. The magnitude of the loss and the pain of the disaster were unprecedented in human history. At that time, looking at the ruins of the war and thinking about future generations, who would want to cause trouble again and restart the war? However, only sixteen years have passed, and the urgency of conflicts between France and Germany due to armaments has been frequently reported. On the German-Austrian border, ordinary disputes are brewing into armed settlement. War clouds fill the international arena in Europe, with a high probability of immediate military action. If it were not limited by economic conditions, the arms race would be even more severe than it is today.</p>
<p>It is well known that France is manipulating Central European disputes, whether it is the issue of Austrian independence or the Polish Corridor issue. There is no need for in-depth discussion. Now the Corridor issue has been put aside for the time being, and Austria-Hungary in Central Europe has become the core of the dispute. Italy, taking advantage of the fact that Germany's power is not yet fully developed and France is difficult to intervene, has exerted its diplomatic acumen to lure Austria-Hungary with economic outlets, enabling them to break through the current difficulties and open up a path for the future. Since Dolfuss and Botha visited Rome, the three dictators have jointly consulted to form a new situation in Central Europe. Politically, the independence of Austria has been guaranteed. In the future, Italy will stabilize its political hegemony in Central Europe as France used to do with small countries as satellites. Economically, Austria-Hungary has gained access to the sea and will be more willing to accept Italy's command, forming a three-nation economic alliance centered on Italy. What we should study today is how Europe will be affected after the establishment of this three-nation agreement and how the Mediterranean will be affected.</p>
<p>The most likely issue to trigger disputes in the Austrian independence issue is the German-Austrian relationship. In the German-Austrian dispute, France is bound to be implicated to assist Austria, making Germany unable to do anything. Unexpectedly, Italy, in the face of a critical situation, quickly and actively took action. The three-nation agreement was completed in a short period of time. Limited by the surrounding environment, Germany cannot but be wary of France. It has no way to undermine Italy's diplomatic achievements and must find other ways to respond. Therefore, there will still be fierce competition in the future between Germany and Italy in diplomacy. Moreover, now that Italy is the leader of Austria-Hungary, it will inevitably seek to dominate Central Europe. France's hegemony will inevitably be severely affected. Although France and Italy have the same feeling in maintaining Austria's independence and restraining Germany's development, it is difficult to reconcile their ambitions for hegemony. Italy has already achieved what it wanted, but France may not be afraid of it. In the future, the struggle between France and Italy may become more obvious. Moreover, the countries in the Danube basin of the Little Entente are historically connected because of the cession of Hungarian territory, and ethnic minorities are still in turmoil. In terms of the current situation, Italy's control of the Adriatic Sea power has blocked South Slav's sea route. It is difficult to ensure that the temporarily dormant volcano on the Balkan Peninsula will not erupt again. As for inviting the countries of the Little Entente to join the three-nation agreement, unless the countries in the Danube basin are willing to be controlled by Italy, like Austria-Hungary, how else can it be coordinated? South Slav's desire to obtain control of the Adriatic Sea is no less than that of Italy. France is willing to be its strong backing, how can it easily give way? France's desire to restrain Italy's excessive development is well known. At the very least, it should be able to divide the Adriatic Sea power equally before it can control the interests of the Mediterranean Sea and maintain its position as the leader in Europe, which Italy must contend for. Therefore, after the establishment of the three-nation agreement, the disputes may become more intense.</p>
<p>The Black Shirt Prime Minister has clearly stated that Italy must find a way out in Africa, especially in cooperation with Asia. When it succeeds in Central Europe, it wants to extend its ambitions to North Africa and gain a foothold in Asia Minor. Its only rival for hegemony in the Mediterranean is France. The North African territory has been divided by France and Italy. Tripoli is very barren, and all the coasts are unsuitable for development. The only way is to rely on Tunisia as a port. However, the port is under French protection and control, so it cannot allow Italy to develop arbitrarily there. Italy is also very poorly endowed. Besides arousing patriotic enthusiasm to seek outward development, there is no other way. Judging from the words of the Black Shirt Prime Minister, his eagerness to open up North Africa is evident in his words. Therefore, after the establishment of the three-nation agreement, not only will the European issue become more complicated and激劇性 from now on, but it may also extend to the Mediterranean and as far as North Africa.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Conference to Promote Shipping Opens <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The First General Meeting Discusses Two Important Proposals, and President Wang Attends and Delivers Instructions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Conference for the Promotion of Shipping opened on the 20th. The first general meeting was held in the afternoon, with over 50 representatives in attendance. The first general meeting discussed: 1) A proposal to open up ocean shipping routes (including six proposals from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Shanghai Shipping Association), resolving that the Ministry of Transportation should formulate detailed measures and, together with the Shanghai Shipping Association and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, take the lead in preparing for implementation; 2) A proposal regarding the regulation of the shipping industry (including ten proposals from the Board of Directors, Board of Supervisors, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the Qingdao and Yantai Shipping Administration Offices), resolving to organize a review committee for examination. Wang Bofen, Wei Wenhan, He Molin, Zhang Shulin, Li Yunliang, Yang Guanbei, Wang Zigang, and Chen Yisheng were appointed as reviewers and held a review meeting at the Central Hotel. Considering that the term "regulation" might be confrontational, the term "cooperation" was temporarily used to draft a review report for discussion at the general meeting on the 21st. The conference was originally scheduled to close on the 22nd, but because there were still about 50 items on the agenda, including proposals for the recovery of navigation rights, seafarer treatment, tax reductions, river dredging, and waterway intermodal transport, it was decided to extend the session by one day, with the closing ceremony on the 23rd. The agenda for the second general meeting on the morning of the 21st included: 1) The review report on the regulation of the shipping industry; 2) The recovery of navigation rights; 3) Seafarer treatment. A third general meeting was held in the afternoon. It was also learned that the conference discussed various proposals. 3) Regarding the proposal to open up ocean shipping routes, during the discussion, various private shipping companies proposed that the government should order the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to focus on developing inland river shipping routes. Yu Qiaqing stated that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should prioritize Southeast Asia for opening up overseas routes, estimating a capital requirement of 10 million yuan. Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is state-owned, planning would be easier. If this could be realized, it would both reassure overseas Chinese and serve as a preliminary step for the government to develop the shipping industry. He Molin of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company said that developing shipping routes was appropriate, but capacity remained a problem. Zhu Jiahua said that overseas routes could not be established without capital. State-owned enterprises could not accomplish this in the short term, and private enterprises would have difficulty raising substantial funds temporarily. However, if ocean shipping routes were not developed, the country's sovereignty and interests would be greatly affected. Therefore, he proposed that the original proposal be changed to "The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should plan to open up ocean shipping routes and reorganize existing domestic shipping routes." The Shipping Administration Department also had a proposal to first procure six ships and temporarily operate one, from Shanghai to Southeast Asia via British and Dutch territories, through Indian, Russian, French, Belgian, and British ports, estimating a capital requirement of 5-10 million yuan, encouraging private management. At the time, there was considerable debate among various private and state-owned companies. As a result, it was decided that the Ministry of Transportation should formulate detailed measures and dispatch personnel to, together with the Shanghai Shipping Association and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, take the lead in preparing for implementation. 2) Regarding the proposal for the regulation of the shipping industry, the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had one proposal, and the Board of Supervisors had another. Among them, the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company proposed that the government should strongly support state-owned and private shipping enterprises and establish a China Shipping Regulation Committee. He Molin and Li Yunliang, representatives of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stated that in the past, shipping merchants had different opinions due to private and state-owned management, leading to mutual competition and self-destruction. As a result, the shipping industry, with its weak strength, was still oppressed by foreign merchants. This time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company proposed to establish a regulatory committee, not out of any prejudice, because the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would also be subject to regulation and had no special interests to speak of. What was hoped for was to achieve the effect of adjusting shipping routes and making an overall allocation for the nation's shipping to counter foreign merchants and recover interests. Representatives from the Yantai, Qingdao, and Tianjin offices also expressed their opinions and should be seriously studied. The chairman stated that without concrete regulations for implementation, it would be difficult to achieve concrete results, and proposed that the Ministry of Transportation hire shipping experts to proceed quickly. Yu Qiaqing said that if shipping merchants want to talk about regulation today, all parties must develop simultaneously in order to achieve it. Otherwise, it should be considered in detail, and it was proposed to first seek cooperation. If all parties deemed it necessary, then a regulation method should be tested. As a result, most advocated prudence, or changing the word "regulation" to "cooperation" would be more conducive to progress. As a result, it was decided to first send a review committee, nominating Yu Qiaqing, Wang Bofen, Wei Wenhan, Bao Molin, Zhang Shulin, Li Yunliang, Yang Guanbei, Wang Zigang, and Chen Yisheng as review committee members, to be discussed at the general meeting on the 21st. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Hede discussed that at this shipping conference, he believed that China's shipping industry was awaiting promotion, so the development of state-owned enterprises was beneficial to people's livelihood, and the development of private enterprises was also beneficial to people's livelihood. There were no boundaries in the beginning. What we must pay close attention to today is how to regain navigation rights. This is related to national sovereignty and is a major key to whether the shipping industry develops or not. It is hoped that the government and the people will cooperate fully to achieve the goal of regaining sovereignty. (20th, Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Transportation's Conference for the Promotion of Shipping opened at 9:00 AM on the 20th in the Ministry of Transportation's auditorium.

The meeting adjourned at noon. Zhu and Zhang hosted a lunch banquet for the representatives at Minghu Chun. The first meeting continued in the afternoon. (20th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Finance, Huai salt has always been transported by sailing ships, and more than 200,000 households rely on it for their livelihood, all of whom use the Twelve Forts as a gathering place for transshipment and export. Salt taxes are paid in Yangzhou. Since the relocation of the Huaihe Transport Office to northern Jiangsu, wheel transport allows for full payment of taxes in installments, which is faster and saves expenses. However, this has a great impact on the livelihood of boatmen. The Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to this matter, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government has also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to find ways to provide relief so that these more than 200,000 laborers will not suffer from hunger and cold, which would affect local security. A plan for wheel and sail transport has now been adopted. After careful consideration by the Ministry of Finance, measures have been drafted and will be ordered to be organized separately by the Huainan Transport Deputy after approval by the Executive Yuan.

<p>US Relinquishes Naval and Military Base and Cotton Production Restriction Bills Also Pass</p>
<p>(Washington) The Philippine Independence Bill, stipulating that the Philippine Islands must indicate their willingness to organize a republic before October 1, was passed by the House of Representatives today. The bill has now been sent to the Senate. This bill was requested by President Roosevelt for discussion by Congress on March 2, and is generally the same as the previous bill approving Philippine independence, but with important amendments, namely that the United States relinquishes its naval and military bases in the Philippines. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives passed the Philippine Independence Bill today. The bill was proposed by Senators Tydings and McDuffie, proposing that the Philippine Islands could be independent within the next twelve or thirteen years. The previous Philippine Independence Bill, after being rejected by the Philippine Senate, expired on January 17 of this year. The current Philippine Independence Bill extends the previous Philippine Independence Bill to October 17, and proposes to first withdraw the army stationed in the Philippines this year, and then gradually withdraw the navy before independence is implemented. The Department of the Navy is currently considering the bill in detail and relinquishing the naval base. It is said that the bill may also pass in the Senate, and President Roosevelt may approve it tomorrow. (19th, National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) The subcommittees of the Senate and House of Representatives today expressed their agreement with the full text of the Vinson-Trammell Naval Act. This bill will undoubtedly be made into law by Congress. President Roosevelt is also prepared to sign it because both houses have passed the bill. The Senate has an additional amendment to the plan, stipulating that private companies may not exceed 10% of profits when building warships. The intention of this amendment is to avoid private companies from profiting from the naval shipbuilding plan, but the bill must therefore be discussed by the parliament again. The Vinson-Trammell Naval Act allows the U.S. Navy to build 102 new warships and 1,184 aircraft to reach the limit allowed by the 1922 Naval Limitation Treaty. The Vinson-Trammell Navy has no special provisions for the allocation of funds, but the estimated cost for the next seven years is between US$1,000,000,000 and US$560,100,000,000. President Roosevelt expressed his intention to approve the bill, and his reason is that the bill can not only enhance the national defense of the United States, but also provide a livelihood for thousands of unemployed shipyard workers. The steel, electrical, and other industries related to shipbuilding will also benefit. The Vinson-Trammell Naval Act was jointly proposed by Senator Trammell and Representative Vinson. The most important of the bill's shipbuilding plans is to build one 15,000-ton aircraft carrier, several destroyers and submarines, and two cruisers. Up to now, according to the naval treaty, the United States is still short of one aircraft carrier, one heavy cruiser, five light cruisers, sixty-five destroyers, and thirty submarines. It is said that the U.S. naval air force will also reach the treaty's maximum limit because of the 1,184 aircraft specified in the bill. Of these 1,184 aircraft, 650 have already been built, and the remaining 534 will be put out to tender after President Roosevelt approves them. (19th, National Telegram)</p>

News from Rome indicates that the Italian government has not received any news that negotiations are about to begin. News from Moscow indicates that various foreigners are paying close attention to the possible issue of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations. The general opinion is that although Soviet Russia did not rely on the League of Nations in the past, it now hopes to participate in European political and diplomatic activities, so its previous attitude may change.

The details are as follows: (1) Regarding the guarantee deposit and the first half of this year's fishing zone rental fees, the Russian side acknowledges Japan's request to pay in Japanese yen according to the previous exchange rate. (2) Japanese and Russian fishermen will not compete in the 42 fishing zones that are related to Japan's interests.

<p>Government and Congress Clash Greatly; Silver Faction Members Attack Treasury Secretary Morgenthau for Delaying Policy; House of Representatives Passes Bill to Purchase Silver to Compensate Farm Product Prices</p>
<p>(Washington) The Steagall Amendment, authorizing the Treasury Department to purchase silver at 25% above the market price to be imported into the United States to offset farm product prices, was passed in the House of Representatives today. The votes in favor exceeded the required two-thirds majority by eleven votes. If this bill becomes law, it will have a significant impact on silver prices. The Treasury Department, according to this bill, may issue special silver certificates to pay for the silver it purchases. This bill will now be sent to the Senate. Although the House of Representatives welcomed this bill with 257 votes to 112, it is still doubtful whether the Senate will pass it, as Treasury Secretary Morgenthau opposes taking immediate action on this bill. The proposer expects that the Senate will pass this bill without any difficulty. The House of Representatives originally intended to discuss another silver bill today, namely, the Vestal Amendment, which advocates that the Treasury Department purchase silver up to 1.5 billion ounces until prices return to the levels of 1926. However, Speaker Rainey stated that today's agenda has been slightly changed and that only the Steagall Amendment can be discussed. Rainey also said that President Roosevelt may make a statement on silver tonight. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government has decided to adopt a delaying policy on the silver bill in this session. Today, many members of Congress issued statements attacking this policy. It is reported that Professor Rogers, a renowned international economist and one of President Roosevelt's brain trusters, will soon go to China to investigate the current situation of silver and will specialize in studying the impact of increased silver prices on US trade with the Far East. However, the leaders of the silver bill in both the House and Senate strongly disapprove of Rogers' trip to China. Senator Wheeler stated today that in this session, the government will use Rogers' trip abroad as an excuse to shelve the silver bill. Wheeler has always advocated supporting the administrative authorities and is the main proponent of defending the silver bill. Wheeler said, "Nine out of ten people in the East are uneducated. Businessmen and industrialists in the East are taking advantage of the low silver prices to quickly become wealthy merchants. Under these circumstances, how can Professor Rogers obtain a real understanding of the impact of increased silver prices on the East?" Wheeler continued, "Rogers' trip is just an ideal." Senator King echoed Wheeler's views, believing that Rogers' trip to China contradicted the views of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. King also stated that the results of Rogers' investigation in China would not be the news that the Senate desires. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has become the target of public attacks because Morgenthau's recent statement angered those who support the silver bill. Morgenthau stated that, according to the Treasury Department's investigation of those who hold speculative silver stocks, he is increasingly convinced that the efforts of the silver bill supporters are not without reason. Morgenthau's statement has caused great resentment among members of both the House and Senate. Observers believe that Morgenthau's statement actually contributed to the Steagall Silver Bill being accepted by a majority of members of Congress today. Senator Pittman visited Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today and demanded that Morgenthau hand over evidence to prove that supporters of the silver bill are engaging in silver speculation outside of Congress. Senator Schramm read out Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's letter, which stated that the Treasury Department's investigation into this matter did not find any members of Congress purchasing silver. Pittman believed that the wording of the Treasury Secretary's letter was insufficient and insisted that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau must provide sufficient evidence regarding the silver speculators outside of Congress who are lobbying for the passage of the silver price increase bill in both houses of Congress. However, the Treasury Secretary has not yet yielded to this demand. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Mussolini's Bombastic Remarks Disrupt European Situation <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Africa is Italy's Fourth Coast; Franco-Italian Dispute Takes a Further Step</p>
<p>(London) Mussolini's speech at the Second Five-Year Congress of the Fascist Party not only caused deep reflection in Europe but was also unanimously regarded in London as a clear sign of more troubles to come. The Franco-Italian conflict began with the status of Italians in Tunis and the difficulty in easing the situation. Italy has recently made strides in Africa through its military and economic organizations, and it has even intensified domestic propaganda by appropriating the statement that Africa is Italy's fourth coast. In the past eight years, Italy's influence in Africa has grown surprisingly. There are many books on this matter, and Mussolini has even written prefaces for them. The appointment of Italy's most famous aviator, General Balbo, as the Governor of Libya a few months ago is another indication of Italy's emphasis on Africa. This speech, delivered after the establishment of the Danube Pact, which made Italy appear to be the protector of Austria and Hungary, is said to contain even deeper meaning. Carefully examining Mussolini's remarks regarding Germany, disarmament, and the future of the League of Nations, and his tone in identifying Fascism as a political system that would make Rome admired by all, reminds one of previous predictions that Mussolini's ambition is to make Italy the leader of the world. This makes one feel that there is increasing evidence to support this. (Special Telegram from the Japan Times, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Italy, Austria, and Hungary Reach Agreement <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Germany Expresses Non-Participation, Believing it Will Create Future Disputes</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since the publication of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's remarks on Sunday, the semi-official foreign affairs commentary newspaper here has published an article expressing considerable satisfaction with Mussolini's remarks, saying that all kinds of speculation in the outside world about Italy's attitude can be cleared up, and it is particularly pragmatic to maintain Germany's important sovereignty and does not contradict its original purpose. As for the Three-Nation Agreement, although it is not necessary to exaggerate its importance too much, the method it adopts is quite similar to the methods France is accustomed to using. Therefore, this kind of solidarity is easy to turn into "a tyrannical alliance of countries," which creates future disputes. For this reason, Germany has never been willing to participate in this kind of connection. The agreement states that if one country wishes to consult with each other when any event occurs, they must consult with each other, but the location of the meeting and which country's words are the most powerful among the three countries are also questions. However, the Austrian people are 100% German, and Hungary insists on its independent attitude, so in the future, there may not be a tendency that is incompatible with the interests of the two small countries. From an economic point of view, the achievements of the agreement are not great, because Italy's original proposal was to organize a customs union of Italy, Austria, and Hungary. The newspaper also said that Germany will continue to improve the economic organization of the Danube countries as it has done in the past decade and will protect its own economic interests so that they are not interfered with by one-sided attempts with political purposes.

<p>Stealing Secret Information from Britain, France, and the United States</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the French Secret Service discovered a large-scale espionage organization dedicated to stealing secret information from countries such as Britain, France, and the United States for Germany and Soviet Russia. As a result of today's search, a total of sixteen people were arrested, including a professor, and a large number of important documents, codebooks, and maps were seized. This search was based on information provided by the Stevel-Stevelsville couple, who were arrested last December. According to reports, the Stevelsville couple did not reveal the truth until yesterday. Professor Lesch, who was also experimenting at the Paris Biological Institute, is also among the sixteen people. Therefore, the news of Lesch's involvement in the conspiracy has shocked political and scientific circles. The organization is dedicated to investigating the secrets of Britain, the United States, and France on a very large scale, employing a large number of personnel, especially paying attention to news on the army, navy, poison gas, and armaments, as well as commercial data. In addition, a female dentist named Duvisi is also a member of the organization, specializing in delivering secret documents and photographs to various cities in Switzerland, and then transferring them to Moscow and Berlin from there. Professor Lesch receives a monthly salary of 3,000 francs. Most of the other documents concern wartime industrial mobilization plans, and there is also a map registering important factories throughout France. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Situation of Labor-Management Disputes in the United States is Becoming Increasingly Serious <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Strikes Brewing, Threatening to Affect the Entire Country; Emergency Meeting Held in New York</p>
<p>(Washington) Labor-management conflicts in the United States are erupting from time to time, and the scope of these conflicts threatens to affect the entire country. The three major industries of the nation are particularly hard hit. Therefore, President Roosevelt and Attorney General Cummings convened a meeting here today to discuss opinions on the serious situation, as a general strike would be detrimental to the government's recovery plan. At the same time, industrial leaders gathered in New York to discuss the current situation of the railway and automobile industries. In San Francisco, mediators believe that the dockworkers' strike will indefinitely block the shipping industry on the western coast of the United States. The meeting between the President and the Attorney General at the White House lasted for several hours. After the meeting, rumors spread that the government would take decisive measures when necessary to avert the crisis of a strike. Currently, with the exception of the Ford Motor Company, other prominent American automobile companies have sent representatives to participate in the meeting held in New York. The goal of this meeting is to plan how to deal with future strikes, as strikers have issued threats to disrupt the national automobile industry, causing 250,000 people to stop working, and will directly incite workers in the railway, steel, and coal mining industries. While the industrialists were meeting, the National Automobile Workers Union declared that it had no intention of recognizing the American Federation of Labor and did not want to enter into any contracts with the American Federation of Labor for the sake of the automobile workers. Railway authorities in New York have met with leaders of the American Federation of Labor, but there has been no progress in the wage dispute. Railway strikers claim that if the capitalists do not make concessions, they will bring national transportation to a standstill. Railway representatives insist that railway employees must acknowledge the current wage calculation system and continue it for the next six months. A spokesperson for the union not only rejected this proposal, but also demanded compensation for the one-tenth wage reduction of the previous six months. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>Detroit: If the labor-management dispute in the American automobile industry is not resolved within two days, it may lead to an unprecedented labor movement in American history. Therefore, automobile industry employers are making another effort today to respond to the workers' demands. The workers are currently opposed to the employers' insistence on forcing workers to join company unions. The National Automobile Industry Association issued an article to the workers today, stating that workers should decide for themselves whether they want to transfer their right to negotiate with the company to labor leaders who make this their profession. The article also asked workers to pay attention to the recent wage increases and reduced working hours in the automobile industry. Representatives of the American Federation of Labor replied that if workers vote in favor of joining the company union after an election is held outside the automobile factory under the supervision of the National Recovery Administration, then the American Federation of Labor will naturally concede. (Reuters Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Managers of various railway bureaus in the United States met here today and decided on a 15% wage reduction plan, to be implemented from July 1st. Railway employees strongly opposed this, saying that their wages have already been reduced by one-tenth and they are already suffering a great deal. If the reduction is increased to 15%, they will feel even more hardship. Railway employee leaders are now requesting that the wage reduction remain at one-tenth. Railway bureau managers seem willing to discuss the proposal not to implement the new wage reduction plan, which is a positive sign. According to news this evening, discussions on this point are still open. At the same time, the automobile industry also held a closed-door meeting in New York today to discuss the threatened strike of 100,000 workers. Ford did not attend, but General Johnson, director of the National Recovery Administration, participated in the meeting, which shows that the Washington authorities attach great importance to the matter. (Reuters Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(New York) The conflict between large industrialists and labor is intensifying, which is an indirect result of the policies implemented by the Economic Recovery Administration. The Economic Recovery Act instructs employers to allow workers to organize unions so that workers can negotiate with employers as a group to resolve disputes when there are conflicts. The current chaos and brewing strikes arise from this. The wave of strikes is spreading to industrial areas, and the most important industries are being threatened. The scope of the conflict was originally limited to automobile industry employers and the American Federation of Labor, but now railway, steel, and California dockworkers have also entered the vortex. In Cranford City, thousands of factory workers have gone on strike. In Tacoma, Washington, 6,616 dockworkers have decided to strike. On the Pacific coast, 60,800 dockworkers have decided that if employers do not recognize the union and allow for reduced working hours and increased wages, they will also take the same action. Chaos and strikes have also occurred in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Indianapolis, Indiana. At the same time, employers are also holding meetings to discuss the situation. They have petitioned Congress to request that Senator Wagner of New York's bill to establish a national permanent labor affairs bureau be rejected. The reason is that if this labor affairs bureau is established, industry and commerce will be controlled by small groups composed of union leaders. In addition, more than 50 large industrial companies in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, and West Virginia also demanded its cancellation, arguing that Wagner's proposal would lead to the danger of worker autocracy. The labor-management conflict has reached a deadlock, and the situation is roughly as follows: employers declare that they cannot obey the orders arbitrarily issued by the American Federation of Labor. Union leaders say that employers are trying to get workers to join employer-organized unions, so no compromise can be reached. The general public believes that if the American Federation of Labor issues a strike order, the number of workers in the automobile industry and its related industries who will stop working will reach 250,000. This attitude will greatly undermine Roosevelt's economic recovery plan. Roosevelt held a special meeting with Attorney General Cummings this afternoon to study some legal issues because each party has its own interpretation of the industry regulations set by the Recovery Administration.

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Meteorological Observatory reported that at 8:00 AM on the 18th, a slight earthquake was felt in the Han-Wu Anqing area. The observatory's seismograph began recording at 8:18:12 AM, lasting for more than two minutes. The nature was rapid, and the calculated direction was slightly west of south, 270 kilometers (478 li) from Beijing. The epicenter was located between Anqing, Zhenshan, and Qian Mountain, and the depth of the fault could be 30 to 40 kilometers. Since the epicenter was located in a mountainous area and the intensity of the earthquake was weak, it would not cause any disasters or losses. There were also two small earthquakes between 4:54 and 4:57 AM, which may have been precursors to the earthquake, but the intensity was very weak. The earthquake was also felt in Hankou.

<p>Main Force of Pseudo 1359 and Other Army Corps Badly Defeated</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Military news, the pseudo First, Third, Fifth, Ninth, Twelfth Army Corps, and the Guard Division, after recent reorganization and replenishment, sneaked from Guangchang on the Grey Day to the Baijinsha and Pingshang areas southwest of Nanfeng, concentrating their forces to attack our Chen positions of the Northern Route Army. At dawn, the pseudo First, Third, and Ninth Army Corps, and the first part of the pseudo Fifth Army Corps, simultaneously advanced towards our positions at Wuduzhai, Donghuashan, Shigushan, Yanglindu, and other places. Another part, via Sanxi Yangmeizhai, made a roundabout attack on our right flank, engaging our Third Route Army in fierce fighting all day long, with the fiercest fighting at Wuduzhai. After fierce attacks by our defending soldiers, they did not succeed. At noon on the Yuan Day, the bandits once again launched a fierce attack on our Yangmeizhai Jianling Chen positions with their main force. Our Third Route Army then launched attacks in several directions. After 4 o'clock, the bandits were surrounded and could not take care of each other from beginning to end, suffering heavy casualties, and retreated in the southwest direction. On the Cold Day, our pursuing troops surrounded and suppressed them in the areas of Zuoqiaotou Ganfang Zhufang. In this bloody battle lasting four days and four nights, the bandits suffered more than 8,000 casualties, with about 3,000 corpses in front of the battle, and more than 20 bandit soldiers were captured alive, and thousands of guns were seized. The detailed number is still being checked. Our side also suffered nearly a thousand casualties. From then on, the bandits' courage has been chilled, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them as scheduled and achieve a complete victory.</p>
<p>Another message, the Headquarters announced that at midnight on the Yu Day, our guerrillas encountered bandits three miles from the Tatai Three Platforms. After an interception by one of our units, the bandits turned north and fled to Guishi Ridge. After two of our units worked together to follow and encircle them, the bandits began to collapse completely and fled to Huaping. In this battle, which lasted about six or seven hours, 700 to 800 bandits were killed, 10 bandits were captured, and 1 machine gun, 3 submachine guns, and more than 200 rifles were seized. In addition, on the 13th, Anfu County sent troops to suppress bandits in Qingshan, seizing 12 bandit guns. The Volunteers of the 81st District sent troops to suppress bandits in Yejikeng, seizing 25 bandit guns. The Yihuang Volunteer Brigade attacked bandits in Huoyuan on the Yuan (13th) evening, killing several members of the pseudo-prosecution team. On the same evening, the Volunteers of the Fourth District sent troops to suppress bandits in Qidu, killing a pseudo-military minister in Makeng, capturing 5 bandits, and seizing 6 rifles, reactionary documents, and a package of pseudo-chops.

<h3 id="e70">Bandit Suppression Begins in Eastern Fujian <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Bandit Gangs Burning and Killing Everywhere, Very Tragic</p>
<p>Wang Jingjiu Has Led Troops to Suppress Them</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The reorganization of the militia in Fujian Province has been completed. Regarding bandit suppression matters, great progress has already been made in northern Fujian. In eastern Fujian, it has also been launched, jointly presided over by the Fuzhou Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Mawei Naval Port Headquarters. The eastern Fujian region includes 15 counties under the former Mindao Circuit, which were divided into Fuzhou and Funing Prefectures in the former Qing Dynasty. The counties where the Red bandits are rampant are Fuding, Shouning, Xiapu, Ningde, and Fuan under the jurisdiction of Funing Prefecture, and Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Pingnan, and Pingtan under the jurisdiction of Fuzhou Prefecture. However, because the area is bordered by the East Sea on one side and connected to Zhejiang on the other, the bandits' traces are extremely elusive. Therefore, although the naval and land fleets and the Fujian and Zhejiang troops have repeatedly launched large-scale joint suppressions, it has been difficult to eliminate them. Recently, the authorities have repeatedly received reports from various county governments and social groups about the critical situation. The cities of Luoyuan, Xiapu, and Shouning Counties have all been surrounded, and the cities and towns of Lianjiang, Luoding, and Ningde have all been looted. It has been found that the bandits in these nine counties are purely local communists, gathered from hooligans and local ruffians. They are called guerrillas or Red Guards, with each gang ranging from a hundred to several hundred people. Every time they capture a township, they set up a pseudo-township Soviet government. Every time they capture a district, they set up a pseudo-district committee, appointing local ruffians as chairmen or members, and looting everywhere. Anyone who has a little property or has any grievances is destroyed. According to a recent report from the Lianjiang Bandit Suppression Committee, in the sixth and seventh districts of the county alone, since January of this year, dozens of district chiefs, township chiefs, Jia chiefs, grain communists, and gentry have been killed, hundreds of men, women, old, and young have been burned to death, more than a hundred houses have been burned down, and more than 100,000 yuan has been looted from shops. All the deeds and certificates owned by the people have been burned to ashes. Lianjiang is a county close to the province, and it is still so rampant. It is conceivable how tragic the coastal areas and the villages in the mountains have suffered. The authorities also believe that it cannot be ignored, so they specially dispatched Wang Jingjiu, the commander of the 87th Division stationed in Fuzhou, to lead troops to suppress them on a large scale the day before yesterday. Wang has now arrived in Ningde, and as soon as he summons the county magistrates of each county to talk and inquire about the bandit situation, he can start the suppression. However, the Weiduo regiment of the Marine Corps stationed in Lianjiang has already breached the bandit dens in Toubao, Ma, Danyang, and Xiaoao in the sixth and seventh districts and is currently carrying out the Qingxiang campaign.

<h3 id="e71">川匪 Abandon Nanba <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Chuan Army Advances on Three Sides, Gains Advantage Repeatedly</p>
<p>Xu Bandit Leads Remnants to Retreat North to Tongjiang</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the Guominjun recovered various counties, including Qu, Ying, Peng, Yi, Sui, and Xuan, from Xu Xiangqian's remaining bandit forces in Sichuan, the occupied area has decreased daily, and their power has gradually waned. Consequently, they shortened the battle lines, fortifying the three counties of Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong. Liu Xiang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression, having completed the first phase of the suppression plan, convened the second phase suppression conference in Chengdu. After determining the strategies, he ordered a general offensive, designating Bazhong as the target. In recent days, the 3rd and 5th Route Armies have joined forces there. The 3rd Route Army, led by Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou, captured Shuangmiao Chang and Xingling Chang on the 13th. The following day, Luo's troops also captured Enyang River, 60 li from Ba. On the same day, the 5th Route Army, led by Fan Shaozeng, launched a fierce assault with suicide squads towards the Honglingtai mountain range, advancing to the line of Honglingtai, Guanzi Zhai, and Yinyang Mountain. The Enyang River is a crucial pass for Bazhong, and fierce hand-to-hand combat ensued, resulting in many casualties. Honglingtai is a well-known natural stronghold, and the battle was especially fierce. The bandits were unable to hold and collapsed in retreat. Currently, the 2nd Route Army, led by Tian Songyao, has also been ordered to join in. Within days, they will encircle Ba city on three sides. The 1st Route Army, led by Deng Xihou, will launch a flanking attack from Wangcang towards Mumen, solely responsible for the northern front, remotely supporting the attack on Ba. On the bandit side, there are five pseudo-armies: the 4th, 9th, 25th, 30th, and 31st. The pseudo-4th Army suffered 80-90% losses in strength during the various battles in Suiyi over a month. It is confirmed that the pseudo-army commander, He Wei, has been killed in action. Xu bandit, facing the critical situation in Ba city, launched a counter-attack but failed. He has plans to abandon Ba and Nan. Therefore, only the pseudo-9th Army, pseudo-30th Army, and guerrillas defend Ba and Nan, while the main force has moved to Tongjiang. Ba and Nan depend on each other like lips and teeth. If Bazhong is lost, it will be difficult to defend Nanjiang for long. According to captured bandits, after being defeated by the Central Army in the Henan-Hubei border region in 1932, they held a military conference. Xu Xiangqian advocated fleeing to Gansu and Xinjiang to open up an international route, while Kuang Jixun advocated fleeing to Sichuan. After fighting with Yang and Tian, they were very successful, so they decided to go deep into Sichuan and planned to seize Kuiwan and connect with He bandit, using Sichuan and Hubei as their base. After entering Sichuan, more than half of the original soldiers were killed or wounded. The newly formed troops are mostly Sichuanese, who are not good at fighting. Subsequently, they suffered repeated defeats. Xu bandit blamed Kuang bandit and killed him. Now, Xu bandit and key bandits such as Chen Changhao have decided to move their headquarters to Tongjiang, considering the critical situation in Bazhong. The ammunition factory, mint, grain depot, and communication organs are all located there. Therefore, it is credible that the bandits will abandon Nanba and retreat to Tongjiang. It is not without a plan. It is said that they will first use the main force to defend Tongjiang. If the Guominjun advances too far, they will enter Shaanxi from Chengkou and flee to northern Hubei, and then wander around the border between Shaanxi, Hubei, and Henan, observing the situation and avoiding strength while attacking weakness. The border area between Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Henan is mostly high mountains and deep valleys, stretching for thousands of miles, and has not been developed. If the bandits flee there, it will be like a tiger entering the mountains, even more uncontrollable. It is heard that He Chengjun has been ordered to go to Xiangfan, in order to prepare for the prevention of the Sichuan bandits from fleeing into the Hubei-Henan border. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Lu Province Strictly Guards Against Liu Bandit's Return <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Sun Tongxuan Appointed Commander of Lunan Garrison</p>
<p>Cavalry Regiment Deployed to Defend Caozhou Area</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Last year, Liu Guitang's remnant bandits fled south, ravaging the border areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, as well as the Pinghan Railway line, causing great suffering to the people. Recently, after being pursued by the Henan army, they fled east again, showing a strong tendency to re-enter their old nest in southern Shandong. Liu Zhi, the chairman of Henan, has telegraphed Han Fuju, the chairman of Shandong Province, to prepare for joint suppression. Han has decided to jointly block and intercept them to prevent future troubles. He has appointed Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 20th Division, as the commander of the Lunan Garrison, and Gu Liangyou, the commander of the Luxi Militia, as the deputy commander, to strengthen vigilance and implement blocking measures. The cavalry regiment led by Li Xuande, stationed in Yucheng, northern Shandong, has been transferred to Jining and Caozhou in southwestern Shandong for guard duty. It is reported that the 1st and 4th companies of the cavalry regiment and the machine gun company, along with the regimental headquarters, were personally led by Li Xuande at 3:00 am today (17th) and took a Jinpu special train to Yanzhou via Jinan. The 2nd and 3rd companies and the transportation platoon, led by Staff Officer Zhao Yiquan, will also pass through Jinan at 2:00 pm today to deploy for defense and jointly block Liu bandit's return. Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 20th Division, has been ordered to concurrently serve as the commander of the Lunan Garrison and will take the Pinghu train No. 301 to Yanzhou at 9:00 pm tonight to be responsible for the suppression. According to Sun, "I am ordered by Chairman Han to prevent Liu Guitang's remnant bandits from fleeing into Shandong, so I am returning to Yanzhou to arrange everything. As for the actual strength of Liu bandits, it has been greatly reduced, with only one to two thousand people. It is heard that they have fled to Guide in eastern Henan and are still fleeing, showing a strong tendency to flee back to their old nest. As for the defense measures in this province, it needs to be decided after arriving in Yanzhou. The cavalry regiment led by Regiment Commander Li has also been ordered to go south and passed through Jinan this morning, first arriving in Yanzhou. Its defense location is planned in the Caozhou area. As for the remaining forces of Liu bandits, it will definitely not be a problem in the future." (17th)</p>

<h3 id="e74">Zhu Jiajua Speaks on New Life Movement and Education <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Beijing News: The Central Party Headquarters held the 122nd weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 am today (19th). Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Zhu Jiajua, Xiao Jishan, Hong Ludong, Wang Luyi, Chen Qianjun, Li Zonghuang, Ke Xing'e, Bai Yunti, and central comrades attended, totaling more than 500 people. Chairman Ye Chucang presided over the ceremony. Committee Member Zhu Jiajua then gave a report titled "New Life Movement and Education." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"When the Capital New Life Movement Promotion Association was established, Jiajua explained the meaning of the movement in detail. The New Life Movement is a great movement for national revival. It arises from the urgent demands of the nation to perform the spirit of the times. Its foundation is propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. It is initiated by the spirit of national history and also takes the mission of promoting the spirit of national history. We must start from daily life and extend to the entire life. We must start from personal life and extend to national life. We must practice what we preach and seek to influence with sincerity, purely cultivate ourselves to create an atmosphere, so as to revive our nation and build our country. In addition to implementing and promoting our movement according to these principles, we also pay attention to the new life of future figures in society. Therefore, the issue of education is closely related to this movement. Jiajua relies on past experience, and has not left the education sector in the past 20 years, so I would like to say a few words here.</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang Kai-shek witnessed the difficulties of the times, so he launched this movement. He knows the shortcomings of our nation now, so he especially pays attention to the cultivation of the four inherent virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Starting from personal daily life, observing propriety starts from cleanliness, understanding righteousness starts from keeping promises, cultivating integrity starts from frugality and simplicity, and knowing shame starts from being responsible. However, is the general life of the Chinese people like this now? Romantic decadence, disunity and superficiality, lack of courtesy, no discipline, no order, no sense of responsibility, as well as corruption and various evils. I think one of the biggest reasons is that education in the past had no purpose, no policy, and no methods. The spirit of the modern Chinese nation has gradually declined. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, it was oppressed by various countries and struggled several times. Seeing the Boxer Movement as the final failure, the nation's self-confidence was completely lost. Since then, all reform movements have imitated foreign countries in everything, blindly following suit. As a result, the inherent historical spirit of China was completely lost. Foreign policies and systems, regardless of whether they are in line with national conditions, are mostly taken as good prescriptions for curing China. All kinds of cosmopolitanism, anarchism, communism, liberalism, etc., have resulted in the complete collapse of China's systems and cultural relics, creating a chaotic situation. Therefore, the young people created during this period are scattered to the society and sow many roots of disaster, damaging the country's vitality. Isn't this the fault of past education?</p>
<p>Therefore, when our party set its capital in Nanjing and began state construction, it first urged the determination of educational goals based on Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings, standing on its own historical spirit to revive the spirit of our nation. At that time, Sun Yat-sen University, together with the education departments of Guangdong and Guangxi, proposed the case of establishing the Three Principles of the People's national education to save the country from danger at the 17th National Education Conference, which was finally revised and passed. The purpose of education was gradually determined to be the revival of the nation. The Second Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee, the Third National Congress, the Fourth National Congress, and the National Conference of our party, regarding educational resolutions, and the provisions of the Constitution and the National Education Chapter, have constantly taken national revival as the consistent purpose of education. After the September 18th Incident, we further sought policies and methods to implement this determined purpose. During this period, the government first issued strict orders to reorganize universities, reducing and merging university departments, improving university content, rectifying academic style, paying attention to practical subjects, establishing scientific terms, and implementing the ban on universities with incomplete equipment and corrupt content. Then, the organization of primary schools to universities was reorganized as a whole. On the one hand, in addition to the original school system, short-term compulsory education methods were implemented to make compulsory education easier to popularize and rapidly promote. The two-part system of primary schools was advocated to save expenses and increase opportunities for children to enter school. The curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools were determined, and a complete set of textbooks for primary and secondary schools, as well as Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan textbooks, were compiled one after another, so that the teaching materials contain historical spirit and focus on national revival to inspire students to love the country and the nation and respect their own historical spirit. More stringent regulations were made on the service of teachers to cultivate discipline. These policies and methods implemented according to the educational goals of our party were expanded in their implementation by the various resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of our party to reorganize national education. These organizational policies and methods of the Ministry of Education in the past two or three years are constantly being carried out. Although there are many obstacles, the results are not easy to see quickly. However, these obstacles are naturally because most people in society do not understand the spirit of national history, so it is not easy to promote educational policies and systems built according to the spirit of national history. Therefore, the New Life Movement is also deeply related to education.</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang Kai-shek launched the New Life Movement this time to transform the entire society and reform all undertakings, and also to use the entire strength of the society to promote the improvement of education, so as to save the nation from danger. Therefore, we should promote the New Life Movement in accordance with this purpose. At the same time, we must know that the New Life Movement must work hard on education and must cultivate the habits of the new life when pure young people are not deeply infected.</p>
<p>In the past few years, we have sown many seeds of national revival in education. The germination, development, and growth of these many seeds depend entirely on the promotion of the strength of the entire society, that is to say, the power of social promotion will definitely be after the success of the new life. There is no doubt that the New Life Movement is particularly deeply related to education, so it is necessary to put forward an explanation."</p>
<h3 id="e75">All Buddhist Statues on Tianlong Mountain Stolen and Sold by Traitors <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Statistics Show the Number of Buddhist Statues, Large and Small, to be About One Hundred</p>
<p>Traitors Stole Them in an Organized Manner</p>
<p>The Main Culprit Arrested in Ping and Sent to Jin for Trial</p>
<p>Beijing News: Among the Buddhist grottoes in our country, the most famous are the Thousand Buddha Caves in Dunhuang, the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, and the Tianlong Mountain Grottoes in Taiyuan. The Shenghousi Grottoes on Tianlong Mountain were carved in the Northern Qi Dynasty. Their style and form are unique compared with the Thousand Buddha Caves, Yungang, and Longmen Grottoes carved in the Northern Wei, Sui, and Tang Dynasties. Moreover, there are very few stone carvings of Emperor Taizong of the Northern Qi Dynasty handed down, which is even more precious. The mountain is about 45 li south of the current provincial capital, which is the ancient Jinyang. Emperor Gao Huan, the founder of the Northern Qi Dynasty, once built a palace here to escape the summer heat. His son, Emperor Wenxuan, rebuilt many temples on the mountain. Now they are all damaged, except for Shenghousi, which stands alone. The temple was built in the first year of Huangjian. It is said that there are 24 grottoes inside, with statistics of about one hundred statues, large and small. In recent years, more and more Chinese and foreign scholars have traveled far to visit. Ignorant villagers occasionally shaved off Buddhist statues and sold them to foreigners. However, the damage caused by petty theft was limited. Most of them can still maintain their original appearance for people to study. Unexpectedly, bad news came last year that all the statues in the grottoes of the temple were chiseled out and transported to foreigners in large quantities. Only one stone Buddha about 24 feet high remained in the temple, but its eyes were also destroyed. This must be because it was too high and could not be moved and sold, so they were angry and did this crazy thing. In addition, the statues, regardless of size, only have traces of axes and chisels left. Even the small statues on the top of the cave were chiseled away. The only remaining Buddhist art of the Northern Qi Dynasty, which has survived for 1,400 years, has since bid farewell to our Chinese people and can never be seen again. It is said that the average price per statue is 10,000 yuan. The traitors only got a million silver dollars. After the academic circles in Beiping heard about it, they sent personnel from the Antiquities Preservation Association to conduct an on-site investigation. They were very sad and indignant and repeatedly thought about investigating and detaining them nearby for investigation. However, the other party's method of transportation and sale was extremely cunning and secret, making it difficult to capture them. Until last winter, personnel from the History Museum affiliated to the Academia Sinica discovered a small batch of flying statues being transported from Jin to Ping for sale. They immediately reported to the personnel of the Antiquities Preservation Association to disguise and investigate. After obtaining conclusive evidence, they notified the Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau to send police to a certain hotel in Changxiang Er Tiao to arrest the shopkeeper surnamed Zhang. According to his confession, the stone statues were mortgaged to a certain Chinese by industry insiders, and he also confessed that they were deposited by Hou, the owner of a hotel in Taiyuan. The Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau ordered the arrest of Hou, who has now been arrested and is being tried by the Taiyuan Court. According to rumors, the chiseling of the stone statues was a large-scale and organized operation. Many people armed with weapons surrounded the temple on the mountain for several days, working leisurely inside and transporting them away in batches. This statement remains to be verified. However, since the case is so serious, it cannot be handled by one or two merchants. It can be asserted that we will see how the court handles the case to find out the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Hai Jun Asks to Expedite Construction of Xisha Island Observatory <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Construction Proposal Already Approved by the Government</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Has Repeatedly Delayed Due to Lack of Funds</p>
<p>We Still Neglect It, Fearing It Will Be Occupied by the French</p>
<p>Beijing News: The Ministry of Navy reported that the construction of an observatory on Dongsha Island, Hainan, will report the climate, facilitate shipping, and benefit both China and foreign countries. The observatory on Xisha Island is also being planned and constructed, but it has not yet started due to lack of funds. However, the island is not far from French Annam, and the French have long thought of getting involved. Recently, newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai published reports that French newspapers are advocating the occupation of Xisha. The Ministry of Navy, seeing the critical situation, again submitted a request to the Executive Yuan yesterday, asking it to pay attention, stating, "The territory of Xisha is related to national sovereignty and diplomacy. In the summer of the 14th year of the Republic of China (1925), the former Ministry of Navy proposed a cabinet meeting and decided to establish an observatory on the island. After the establishment of this ministry, it again jointly submitted a request to your Yuan (Executive Yuan) with the Ministry of Communications on July 4, 1930, to forward it to the National Government, ordering the Ministry of Finance to quickly allocate the estimated 180,000 yuan needed to build the island's radio observatory and other expenses on schedule. Later, it was instructed by your Yuan in July of the same year that 'This case has been submitted to the 77th meeting of this Yuan, and it was resolved to follow the report of the two ministries, which has been forwarded to the National Government and ordered the Ministry of Finance and the Guangdong Provincial Government to comply.' The Ministry of Navy compiled a budget and contacted the Ministry of Finance to receive the funds. However, the construction was delayed due to the Ministry of Finance not allocating funds. In March 1932, the Ministry of Navy approved the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' consultation, stating that the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that the kings of Annam Jia Long had erected monuments and built towers on the island a hundred years ago, and asserted Annam's prior rights, and asked our country to explain according to law. Seeing that the establishment of a station on Dongsha had solved the territorial issue, Xisha still needs to establish a station, and the French are citing unfounded claims, intending to occupy it, it again submitted a request to your Yuan on April 1, 1932, stating that the establishment of a station on the island is of great importance, and if it is not done now, the consequences will be difficult to imagine. It is still requested to order the Ministry of Finance to investigate the case and allocate funds. Subsequently, it was instructed by your Yuan in April that 'This case has been submitted to a meeting of this Yuan and resolved to order the Ministry of Finance to allocate the funds in installments within six months to finance the project.' In addition to ordering the Ministry of Finance to comply, please be informed. The ministry then consulted the Ministry of Finance for allocation of funds and planned to proceed with everything. Later, the Ministry of Finance replied that it was financially exhausted and had no funds to allocate. The Ministry again submitted a request to your Yuan in mid-May, and it was instructed that 'This case was recently submitted by the Ministry of Finance, stating that it was financially exhausted and had no funds to allocate, and it was instructed to make efforts to raise funds.' Later, it was instructed by your Yuan in May that 'According to the Ministry of Finance's report, the Executive Yuan telegraphed to order that the case of the Navy requesting the allocation of 180,000 yuan to build the Xisha Island radio observatory should still follow the previous order to make efforts to raise funds. It was previously ordered by the Executive Yuan that, in the period of national crisis, financial stagnation, and extreme financial exhaustion, maintaining the status quo was already difficult. The previous expenses were so large that it was really impossible to allocate funds at one time, and the situation has been reported. Now, with the previous cause, although the current situation has slightly eased, the source of finance is still exhausted. It is only hoped that the previous expenses can be given more time, and once the finances are slightly better, they will be allocated in accordance with the instructions.' Therefore, the establishment of a station on the island has been suspended to this day and has not been started. On the 7th of this month, newspapers in Shanghai and Beijing published that French newspapers recently advocated occupying the Xisha Islands, the biggest reason being that the Xisha Islands are the inevitable route for hurricanes to invade Annam in summer and autumn. The island has no meteorological station, and the Annam area cannot receive meteorological reports in advance, so it is difficult to prepare, so it is difficult to implement unless it is occupied in time. The Ministry of Navy has repeatedly stated the importance of the island and the urgent need to establish a station in its reports in July 1930 and April 1932. Now that the French newspapers have such remarks, if we do not act again, it is hard to guarantee that it will not become a reality. Weighing the urgency of the matter, it is really impossible to delay the construction of the station. What should be done to prevent coveting and protect national sovereignty? We hereby submit a document for your review and implementation."</p>

<p>In the case of Han Wentai, the head of Xuxie Township in the 13th District, being kidnapped and brutally murdered by bandits, more than a dozen criminals, including Yang Abao, Zhou Shungen, Li Zhiping, Jiang Hanchen, and Luo Sanxing, were captured one after another. Yang, Zhou, Li, and Jiang were sentenced to death one after another and submitted to the province for review. Later, Jiang Hanchen was ordered by the province to be sent back for retrial. The other three were approved for the death penalty and executed by firing squad. Now, Jiang Hanchen, who was sent back for retrial, has been interrogated several times by the magistrate of the county court. Jiang also hired lawyer Zhou Jiapu to appear in court for defense. The debate ended on the 17th, and the official verdict was announced yesterday. Jiang Hanchen was sentenced to death for the crime of helping others to extort ransom, and was deprived of his civil rights indefinitely. As soon as it is approved by the province, it will be executed. Jiang's mother heard the verdict in court and cried bitterly, which was unbearable to hear.</p>

<p>On the 16th of this month, a traveler who claimed to be Wu Shan, 26 years old, came to Huashang Hotel on Tongyun Road in this city from Su and booked room No. 2. On the 17th, he left. On the 18th, the traveler hurriedly came to Huashang Hotel again and stayed in room No. 2 under the name of Wu Shan. On the same day, he visited Meiyuan and other famous attractions and returned to the hotel without any abnormality. Yesterday (20th) at 11:00 am, the teahouse waiter Xu Jingxian called Wu Shan since he had not gotten up yet, but there was no response. Knowing something was wrong, he went to the balcony from the neighboring room, broke the window and entered the room. He saw that the traveler had already died. He immediately reported to the accountant and forwarded the report to the county court, requesting an autopsy. After receiving the report, the prosecutor's office sent prosecutor Shen, accompanied by coroner Wang, to conduct an autopsy at 4:30 pm. The autopsy revealed that the traveler Wu Shan had blood flowing from his mouth, and his face was slightly blue. It was confirmed that he died of poisoning before his death. After the autopsy, the hotel was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial. The cause of the suicide is nothing more than economic difficulties and broken love.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that in this era of open social interaction and increasingly complex social situations, relying solely on male police officers is difficult to cover all aspects. Moreover, Jiangsu Province is close to the capital, and all facilities should be a model for other provinces. Female police officers should be established in a timely manner to meet the needs of the environment and ensure social security. Therefore, it specially ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to issue a circular to all counties, ordering them to comply quickly. The original text of the circular is as follows: It is ordered to comply with the fact that in this era of open social interaction between men and women and increasingly complex situations, relying solely on male police officers is difficult to cover all aspects. Female police officers should be established in a timely manner to maintain social stability and prevent future hidden dangers. It is hereby ordered to the authorities of all counties and police agencies to comply with the order and organize quickly, and to report the progress of the work at any time for verification. The measures for establishing female police officers are: 1. The provincial police school should recruit one-tenth of female students in each enrollment to receive the same level of police education as male students. 2. The provincial police training school should recruit one-tenth of female students in each enrollment to receive the same level of primary police education as male police officers. 3. In addition to complying with the regulations of the police academy and police training school, the qualifications for recruiting female police officers are: 1. They must be over 18 years old and under 25 years old. 2. They must be over 4 feet 5 inches tall. 3. They must not have been sentenced to more than one year of imprisonment. 4. Except for detective studies, the courses taught should be taught according to the textbooks of each level of police. 5. After graduating from female police, in addition to special matters that should be paid attention to and efforts made (such as investigating important cases), their tasks are to investigate household registration, inspect, rescue, women and children, and maintain social customs. 6. Except when performing special tasks, female police officers should wear plain clothes. The uniforms they wear should be the same as male police officers, but they should wear black skirts to distinguish them and avoid public misunderstandings.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Large Number of Opium Offenders Arrested in the City <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Our county's urban and rural areas are vast and densely populated, making opium suppression and inspection inherently difficult. Furthermore, public security personnel are often suspected of neglecting their duties, and police officers are suspected of extorting money, making it difficult to eradicate opium use. Since County Magistrate Ma took office over a year ago, despite repeated orders for strict prohibition, enforcement has been weak, and the root of the problem has not been eradicated. County Magistrate Ma deeply regretted this, and after a long investigation lasting four months, he secretly verified that there were more than five hundred households operating opium dens. Magistrate Ma remained calm and, on the evening of the 18th, summoned the county detective team and all political police to the county office, ordering them not to leave to prevent leaks. He also secretly summoned the constables from various districts and towns to the county. At approximately 8 p.m. that evening, accompanied by Section Chiefs Yin and Tang, Deputy Chief Commander Lu of the Security Corps, Deputy Captain Zhao of the Police Squad, and others, he led the entire detective team and political police to conduct searches in different areas according to the addresses and registers. The search concluded at dawn the next day. As a result, a total of 125 male and female offenders were arrested, and hundreds of sets of opium paraphernalia were seized. They were subsequently escorted to the county government for interrogation and required to sign pledges for further investigation.</p>

<p>In Liuhe Town, Second District, a fire broke out at the residence of a Mr. Li in Xiaozhadao, Jiancheng Street, at around 1 p.m. on the 18th due to carelessness while boiling water for laundry, igniting straw. The fire quickly spread through the roof and could not be extinguished, consuming more than sixty homes and destroying over three hundred houses. Two elderly women perished in the blaze. The loss is estimated at tens of thousands of yuan. Liu Xiangqing, an employee of the Liuhe Bus Station, fell into the fire while attempting to extinguish it from the roof, sustaining severe injuries. He was immediately taken to Huizhong Hospital for treatment. His condition is reportedly critical, and his life is in danger.</p>

<p>Shanghai and Ningbo merchants Zheng Hairuo, Qiu Zaichun, Zhang Yanqing, and others, recognizing Ningbo as an important trading port and the necessity of establishing a national goods department store, began preparations in Shanghai and Ningbo around December of last year. They leased a location on Chemen Street in Ningbo. Last month, they held a meeting in Shanghai and elected Zheng Hairuo and six others as directors, and appointed Cao Meiping as the director of the general management office. After completing all arrangements for the department store, they held an opening ceremony at 10 a.m. yesterday (the 18th) in the auditorium of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce. After the ceremony, a band led guests to the department store, where County Magistrate Chen Baolin performed the gate-opening ceremony, Standing Committee Member Zuo Ju of the County Party Committee performed the flag-raising ceremony, and Wang Wenhan performed the opening ceremony. Business commenced simultaneously, and the number of visitors was exceptionally large, with brisk sales.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Lang Guanpu Discusses Sino-Japanese War Preparations <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan's Plans to go Abroad have been Abandoned</p>
<p>Lang Guanpu, the former acting chairman of Heilongjiang Province, recently arrived in Shanghai from Beiping. A Datong News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Lang at his residence. Given Mr. Lang's long-term presence in the Northeast, his understanding of Sino-Japanese relations is particularly clear. The reporter inquired about the recent Sino-Japanese situation in detail. He said that since Japan seized our Northeast, the Sino-Japanese situation has obviously shifted from</p>
<p>side conflicts to direct conflict. Japan's recent return of the various passes of the Great Wall to our country is primarily due to its preparation for war against Russia. Most of the so-called Japanese Imperial Army that invaded North China has been transferred to northern Manchuria. Currently, the Japanese authorities believe that Soviet Russia will inevitably become Japan's great enemy in the future. A Sino-Russian war is, in essence, unavoidable. Currently, Japan's national strength is sufficient to defeat Soviet Russia. However, since the success of the first Soviet Five-Year Plan, its national strength has increased significantly. Once its second Five-Year Plan is successful, Japan's national strength will lag behind Soviet Russia. Therefore, the Japanese side</p>
<p>advocates a quick war to occupy the Soviet Russian Maritime Province and Vladivostok, a key port serving as the base for the Soviet Russian navy and air force. Because, geographically, the puppet state of Manchuria is already trapped in a large encirclement of over eight thousand li by Soviet Russia. If Japan waits for the success of the second Soviet Five-Year Plan, Japan risks being defeated by Soviet Russia. The Soviet authorities, due to their unstable position, advocate a slow war to strengthen their national strength. The recent</p>
<p>sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway clearly demonstrates its desire to avoid a conflict with Japan at present. They are vigorously constructing defense works along the border, and the situation is very tense. Therefore, Japan cannot wait for the success of the second Five-Year Plan and will launch a preemptive strike to attack Soviet Russia. The Datong News Agency reporter then inquired about</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Zhanshan's recent situation. Mr. Lang replied that General Ma resides at No. 37, 46th Road, British Concession, Tianjin, rising at 7 a.m. and going to bed at 10 p.m. In his free time, he often chats with former subordinates and reads and practices calligraphy for leisure. Since arriving in Tianjin, he has remained in seclusion. Because a certain country offered a huge sum of 300,000 yuan to purchase a traitor to harm Mr. Ma, Mr. Ma's safety is extremely threatened and he may</p>
<p>relocate to Shanghai. His former subordinates have gradually been reorganized, with only over two thousand remaining under Tan Zixin, currently stationed in Henan under the command of Liu Zhi. There are still over five thousand former subordinates scattered in the Jilin Province, Songhua River, and Hulin areas near the Sino-Russian border. As for General Ma's attitude, he absolutely does not participate in any domestic activities. The issue of going abroad has also been suspended due to the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>May 5th</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Tan Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, who was appointed to go to Europe and the United States to study their judiciaries, came to Shanghai to prepare everything. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency spoke with Mr. Tan. According to Mr. Tan, the study tour is now scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the French postal ship *D'Artagnan* on May 5th. He will be accompanied by only three people: Yang Bosen, his English secretary; Li Jing'an, his French secretary; and Jian Bozan, his German secretary. The departure point is France, as the ship is sailing to Marseille. From there, he will proceed to Britain and Germany. He also plans to visit the Soviet Union. The round trip is scheduled for one year. If time permits, he also intends to visit South American countries such as Chile, but this is not certain and will depend on the actual circumstances. Mr. Tan also stated that there are continental and European-American schools of thought in judiciary, and he intends to study both during this trip. However, he will focus primarily on observing the judicial situations in Turkey and Siam. Like our country, Siam and Turkey were once known as the "sick men of East Asia" and have both lost extraterritorial rights. However, Turkey and Siam have both abolished consular jurisdiction and become purely independent nations. However, our country's extraterritorial rights have not yet been recovered. Therefore, this trip will pay particular attention to the judicial conditions in these two countries in order to investigate why our country has not been able to abolish the consular jurisdiction of various countries, whether it is due to the incompetence of our government or whether there are other reasons. Before going abroad, he intends to return to his native Hunan Province, though this intention has not yet been decided. Therefore, whether Mr. Tan's trip to Hunan will materialize remains unknown.</p>

<p>The Fujian National Goods Promotion Association sent a letter to the Sanshan Guild yesterday praising them for continuing to boycott Japanese goods and prohibiting the shipment of national goods on Japanese ships. The letter states: "We have read in the newspapers that your guild convened a general meeting of all Fujian merchants from the north and south to continue boycotting Japanese goods and prohibiting the shipment of national goods on Japanese ships. We deeply admire your patriotic enthusiasm. With the loss of the Northeast and its unrecovered territory, it is the duty of every citizen to unite in hatred and strive for thorough and unwavering implementation. To bring glory to the country and ensure the survival of the nation, we are all in the same boat. We hereby send this letter to urge your guild to resolve to fight, persevere to the end, and vow to wipe out national humiliation. This is what we hope for."</p>

<p>According to the Japanese-language newspaper *Mainichi Shimbun* yesterday, since the 15th of this month, the Japanese silk market in this port has suddenly turned around. On the 19th, with the Tianjin merchants as the center, 1,500 bales were sold. It is expected that there will be 5,000 bales traded within days. In the textile sector, activity is also gradually increasing, so the market price has increased by five jiao to one yuan or more. Also, due to the low price, the Tianjin merchants' interest in buying fine cloth is particularly strong. Yesterday, a contract for 1,300 bales was concluded.</p>

<p>To Properly Revise Freight Rates with Various Merchant Groups</p>
<p>To Chongqing Minsheng Company, and to the Sichuan River Allied Shipping Company: We have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from the Chongqing Hardware Association, the Sundries Industry Association, the Piece Goods Merchants, and other merchant groups, all stating that the Sichuan River Alliance has drastically increased freight rates, by as much as two or three times, with the lowest increase being 100 percent. Furthermore, the old custom of deducting the weight of packing materials has been completely abolished, resulting in a sharp increase in freight costs, exceeding the cost of goods by many times. Upon investigation, the Sichuan River shipping companies have unanimously formed an alliance to</p>
<p>regulate the goods transported, calculating by cost for high-value goods and by weight for bulky goods. As a result, the Shanghai Suzhou goods merchants and others have united in opposition and adopted a policy of suspending shipments. Merchants have been struggling in the market for a long time without resolution. If this continues, both sides will suffer. We believe that with the bankruptcy of our country's rural areas and the declining purchasing power of the people, the economic downturn is a common phenomenon today. There is no reason why all industries are declining while the shipping industry alone can prosper. Our association has repeatedly received letters of appeal from various industries, so we are specially sending this letter to you. We hope that you will uphold the principle of coexistence and mutual prosperity and revise the freight rates properly with various merchant groups based on the old standards. We also hope that you will immediately restore the old shipping conditions. The Sichuan Shanghai Native Place Association.</p>

<p>Damaged the Tong'an Warship in Qingdao</p>
<p>The Yuxing steamship of Zhaoxing Company, which had just undergone major repairs at the Lushun shipyard, loaded coal in Tianjin and arrived in Shanghai via Longkou, Yantai, Qingdao, and other ports. It arrived in Qingdao on the 18th and was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. However, when the Yuxing steamship was leaving Qingdao,</p>
<p>due to the narrowness of Qingdao port, the *Tong'an* warship belonging to the Bohai Fleet was anchored in the harbor. The *Yuxing*, navigating carelessly, collided with the *Tong'an* warship, causing a major accident. The hull of the *Tong'an* warship was broken by the *Yuxing*.</p>
<p>Damaged Warship: After the accident, the *Yuxing* immediately stopped and dropped anchor. The owner of the *Yuxing*, together with the captain of the *Tong'an* warship, jointly inspected the damaged area to prepare for future repairs and negotiations. After the inspection, the *Yuxing* weighed anchor and left Qingdao for Shanghai, but it was delayed by one day.</p>
<p>Sailing to Yingkou Today: Yesterday afternoon, this port received news that the *Yuxing* steamship was generally undamaged and could enter the port today. It will first unload coal at the Hanyeping Wharf and then load cargo at the river wharf. Zhaoxing Company received a telegram from Yingkou yesterday stating that the weather there had warmed up, the ice had thawed, and ships could resume sailing. Cargo was waiting to be shipped from Yingkou, so it was decided that the *Yuxing* would resume sailing today. The cargo going from Shanghai consists mostly of flour, grains, foreign paper, tea, etc. This time, the *Yuxing* can be fully loaded. However, items such as cotton yarn and cloth are no longer shipped from Shanghai due to the high import duties imposed to support the inferior goods market.</p>

<p>The General Chamber of Commerce Seeks Proposals from All Parties</p>
<p>According to the *Daily News*, the 18th International Labor Conference, originally scheduled to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on May 14th of this year, has been postponed to June 4th. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has issued a notice to all delegates attending this conference. The most important proposal from our government is to confirm the right to inspect factories in the Shanghai Special District. Proposals from the employer side have been solicited by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce from chambers of commerce in various regions and major factories in this port. They will be compiled and finalized within days. The delegates are scheduled to depart on the Italian postal ship *Conte Rosso* on April 10th. The details are listed below.</p>
<p>Seeking Proposals: The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce issued a letter yesterday soliciting proposals from chambers of commerce in various regions and major factories in this port for the International Labor Conference. The letter states: "We have learned that the 18th International Labor Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on June 4th of this year. We have previously received a notice from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to jointly nominate our country's employer representative and consultant secretary to attend the conference with the China General Confederation of Industry. We have already jointly nominated Mr. Wang Zhisheng as the employer representative and Mr. Ni Hongyi as the secretary. We have now heard that our government representative will propose a resolution on the issue of factory inspection at the conference. This issue is of great importance. How the employer representative should advocate when attending the conference is a matter that requires prior consultation with major factories in the country to serve as a basis for argument. We hereby send this letter to request that you consult with Mr. Wang in person, express your opinions, and provide guidance."</p>
<p>Factory Inspection Issue: Our country's authorities have been actively implementing the issue of factory inspection rights in the Shanghai Special District, but it has not yet been resolved due to obstacles from unequal treaties. With the date of the current International Labor Conference approaching, our government authorities, in order to fight for our country's sovereignty and seek labor welfare, have decided to submit this unresolved issue to the conference for public judgment. It is also heard that the government attaches great importance to this issue and is determined to achieve the goal of its adoption. For the sake of prudence, the employer representative Wang Zhisheng recently sought specific opinions from Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Guo Shun, General Manager of Wing On Textile Factory, Wang Yunwu, General Manager of Commercial Press, Rong Zongjing, General Manager of Shen Xin Textile Company, and other representatives from the industrial sector. The opinions have now been gathered and are ready to be submitted to the conference.</p>
<p>Delegates Scheduled to Leave for Overseas Study: The government representatives attending the 18th International Labor Conference, Li Pingheng, Xie Dongfa, consultants Bao Huaguo, Zhou Shian, employer representative Wang Zhisheng, secretary Ni Hongyi, labor representative An Futing, consultant Cheng Haidao, and secretary Zhang Yi, etc., have decided to depart from Shanghai on the Italian postal ship *Conte Rosso* on April 10th, as the conference date is approaching.

<p>Since Mr. Beck and others from the Western Rotary Club suggested reforming the issue of public rickshaws in the Public Concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to investigate and improve the rickshaw industry and provide relief to rickshaw pullers, established a rickshaw committee in September of last year, appointing three Western members and two Chinese members to conduct investigations for four months. The results, detailed in the Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette's special issue on rickshaws on the 23rd of this month, recommend sixteen innovative measures to reform the current public rickshaw system. The main measures include the annual confiscation of 2,000 of the existing 10,000 rickshaw operator licenses in the concession starting in January 1935, the establishment of a new operating company, the elimination of contractors, the reduction of rickshaw rentals from 14 cents to 8 cents per day per rickshaw, and the setting of minimum passenger fares at 10 cents, 20 cents per mile, and 60 cents per hour. These measures have aroused unanimous opposition from over 100,000 rickshaw operators, contractors, and rickshaw pullers in the city, who have risen up in protest, convened meetings, and organized countermeasures, creating a serious situation that has attracted attention from both Chinese and foreigners. The news from yesterday is summarized below.</p>
<p>Yin Zhiling Met with Mr. Bell to Discuss the Issue: The Shanghai Rickshaw Trade Association's Special District Office, in addition to issuing a declaration correcting the report and requesting the Municipal Council to pay attention to it, also held a general meeting of all rickshaw operators in the Special District at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the morning of the 14th of this month, attended by over 1,500 people. The report was unanimously recognized as having a plan to deprive rickshaw operators and cut off the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers under the guise of improving the rickshaw industry and providing relief to rickshaw pullers. They unanimously and resolutely opposed it. On the spot, Yin Zhiling, Gu Songmao, and others were elected to negotiate with the Municipal Council and issue a declaration and petition, stating six measures for rickshaw operators to automatically improve the rickshaw industry and provide relief to rickshaw pullers, including establishing rickshaw puller hospitals and new rickshaw puller villages. This has turned the rickshaw issue, which has been causing an uproar, into a social movement of extreme importance to improve the lives of over 100,000 laborers. Mr. Bell, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, held a final review of the rickshaw report at a management meeting the night before and invited Yin Zhiling to the Chairman's office for a discussion at 3 p.m. Rickshaw Committee Chairman Mr. Massey was also present. The discussion is recorded below: (Bell asked) The Municipal Council will hold an important meeting regarding the rickshaw issue. I would like to hear about the rickshaw operators' license situation and their prices. (Yin replied) Rickshaw operators who change careers for various reasons will sell their vehicles, but there should absolutely be no buying and selling of licenses alone, so I will not answer the price question. (Asked) It is said that rickshaw operators sell their licenses for hundreds of yuan each and make a lot of profit. Is this proper? (Answer) Rickshaw operators who sell their vehicles may receive hundreds of yuan per vehicle, but only the former foreign-owned Flying Star Company has a payment plan where the rental fee is used to offset the vehicle price, so it can amount to four or five hundred yuan. On the Chinese side, there are few cases where a vehicle worth over one hundred yuan is bought and sold for four or five hundred yuan. (Asked) Is it untrue that the rickshaw committee's report stated that a former rickshaw operator said that the license was worth 650 yuan? (Answer) Everything said by that former rickshaw operator is an exaggeration, or it is a misunderstanding of the installment payment sale of vehicles. (Asked) What are the rickshaw operators' opinions on reducing rickshaw rentals? (Answer) The Rickshaw Committee suggests 8 cents per rickshaw per day, which should not be too difficult for rickshaw operators. However, the current system of renting out rickshaws is that contractors rent rickshaws from rickshaw companies under long-term contracts, with a rental fee of about 9 cents per rickshaw. The contractors then recruit rickshaw pullers, provide accommodation, and rent out the rickshaws to the rickshaw pullers for 13 or 14 cents per day. If the contractors only collect 8 cents per rickshaw rental from the rickshaw pullers, then the contractors will not only have no way to make a living but will also lose 1 cent per rickshaw per day. The contractors will inevitably be unable to provide rickshaw puller accommodation and loans, and rickshaw pullers will immediately face the risk of unemployment and being evicted by the contractors to collect debts. Rickshaw operators, due to contractual relationships, will also be unable to recover the rickshaws from the contractors for a while to rent them directly to rickshaw pullers. Even if this is feasible, it is doubtful whether rickshaw pullers can find other accommodation and repay the contractors' debts, freely renting rickshaws from rickshaw companies. Therefore, in order to reduce the burden on rickshaw pullers, it is necessary to provide them with accommodation so that they can break away from the contractor relationship and rent rickshaws directly from rickshaw companies. Before the above problems are resolved, a compromise should be made, setting 12 cents as the standard, so that the contractors will have 3 cents left after paying the rickshaw company 9 cents, which should be enough to cover their expenses. If the current rickshaw rental is 14 cents per day, it is hoped that it can be reduced by 2 cents, which will be a small help to the rickshaw pullers. Therefore, I believe that the methods passed by the rickshaw operators' conference to automatically improve rickshaws, provide relief to rickshaw pullers, and establish rickshaw puller villages are thorough methods to fundamentally alleviate the burden and all the suffering of rickshaw pullers. If rickshaw pullers live in the new villages, they will not only benefit from hygiene education and improve their lives, but they can also rent rickshaws directly from rickshaw companies and pay only 8 or 9 cents per day. (Asked) Why didn't rickshaw operators improve relief in the past, and are they confident in carrying out relief improvement in the future? (Answer) In the past, rickshaw operators operated in accordance with regulations, and the authorities did not stipulate relief matters, so they did not pay attention to it. Now, because the Rickshaw Committee's report recognizes that rickshaw pullers are in great need of relief and improved living standards, rickshaw operators are very willing to accept the Rickshaw Committee's goodwill for relief. The general meeting of all rickshaw owners has unanimously passed relief improvement methods and reported them to your bureau. They are determined and capable of implementing them. It is hoped that your bureau will guide the implementation at any time in a spirit of cooperation. (Asked) It is reported that Westerners in your bureau seem to be biased against the rickshaw issue. Is this true? (Answer) Since the publication of the Rickshaw Committee's report, there have been suggestions to establish a new company, abolish the contractor system, regulate fares, and...</p>

Rickshaw businesses are wary of the proposed new company structure, fearing that Westerners proposing improvements to rickshaws may be trying to seize their livelihoods. (Reports indicate that a British merchant has already petitioned the Public Works Department to establish a rickshaw company.) Rickshaw pullers question the proposed minimum fare of one "small ocean" dollar, noting that bus and tram fares start at only five or six copper coins, while rickshaws require twenty or thirty. They worry that passengers will switch to trams, harming the pullers' interests. Some suspect that these proposals are being pushed by tram and bus companies to expand their operations. However, the Human-Powered Vehicle Committee's recommendations may not necessarily reflect the views of your department. Therefore, external rumors of bias towards the proposals cannot be considered reflective of your department's attitude towards rickshaws until you have accepted and implemented them. In short, I have always been involved in education and social work. Having witnessed rural bankruptcy, I came to Shanghai to earn a living through labor. When there is no appropriate method to settle the lives of the hundred thousand rickshaw pullers, it's necessary to maintain the rickshaw industry, and it is not for the benefit of a few rickshaw owners, but for the sake of the lives of the majority of toiling pullers and social stability. From the perspective of social reform movements, helping rickshaw pullers requires not only reducing rent, but also effectively improving their lives, giving them a little common sense, so that they can work in other industries, then there will be no problem in eliminating the rickshaw industry. Therefore, I believe that the realization of the Rickshaw Pullers' New Village plan, the transformation of the rickshaw pullers' environment, and the influence of health education will not only make them physically and mentally healthy, but also eliminate the need for headmen to introduce rickshaw pullers, and allow them to seek other jobs when necessary. At that time, not only will the headman system be naturally abolished, but also the city's rickshaw companies will be naturally eliminated. I sincerely hope that your department and those who are interested in improving the rickshaw industry and rescuing rickshaw pullers will work together to promote and realize the Rickshaw Pullers' New Village plan. (Question) Very good, very good. Please also convey to the gentlemen of your association that this bureau deeply sympathizes with the cause of rescuing rickshaw pullers, has no other intentions, and no private agenda to deprive others of their livelihoods. It is hoped that this will not be misunderstood. (Answer) I am very grateful for your department's kindness in rescuing rickshaw pullers. The rickshaw merchants will certainly actively strive to build all kinds of undertakings for rescuing rickshaw pullers. Although there are many criticisms of the Human-Powered Vehicle Committee's report, its impact on the rickshaw merchants' desire to improve rickshaws and help rickshaw pullers is profound and significant. Therefore, I am very grateful to all the committee members for their deep concern for the rickshaw industry. I heard that after Dr. Yin resigned, Mr. Bell and Mr. MacKay went to the joint meeting of the police and vehicle departments and carefully studied the recommendations of the Human-Powered Vehicle Committee for up to six hours. It is said that as a result, for the sake of prudence, the board of directors was first asked to appoint three more committee members (two Chinese and one foreign) to study in detail how to implement items 4 to 16 of the proposal without being obstructed. Therefore, there is a tendency to implement it in a more relaxed manner.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Union Letter to Rotary Club: The Shanghai Western Rotary Club had previously made suggestions to the concession authorities regarding the improvement of rickshaws. Yesterday, the Shanghai Concession Rickshaw Pullers' General Union sent a letter to the club, stating that the club's views did not fully understand the true situation of the rickshaw pullers. The letter read: "Dear Sirs, you have previously submitted a proposal to the authorities to improve public rickshaws, and have now expressed your sympathy for the recommendations of the Human-Powered Vehicle Committee, which shows your great concern for transportation and your compassion for laborers. If this is implemented, it will be thanks to your association's promotion that the workers will be able to improve their lives. We are grateful and immeasurably moved. However, we must speak out against the idea of gradually eliminating rickshaws as a means of abolishing inhumane practices. The rickshaw pullers come from the sea and are mostly rural people. They want to do business but have no capital, and they want to work but have no introduction. Their only job is pulling rickshaws, and they have no other skills. If rickshaws were to disappear one day, no matter how painful it would be for the rickshaw merchants and headmen, the hundred thousand rickshaw pullers and their families would inevitably lose their livelihoods and become starving corpses. How could we bear this? Therefore, we have sent this special letter to you, hoping that you will consider our plight and apply to the authorities to set up more factories and accommodate as many people as possible so that they can work and support themselves. If there is no way to settle us, please reconsider all proposals that imply the gradual elimination of rickshaws in order to maintain the livelihoods of the hundred thousand rickshaw pullers in the concession. This is our prayer. Respectfully to the Shanghai Western Rotary Club, from Chen Guorong, Hu Yucheng, He Songlin, Pan Jingang, Wang Dexi, Xu Chengsif, Xu Zhulin, Xu Zhaoyuan, Yao Shengting, Xu Chengyu, Pan Jinshu, and others, representatives of over eighty thousand rickshaw pullers in the Shanghai Public Concession."</p>
<p>Two Foreign Newspapers Report on the Attitude of the Public Works Department: The North-China Daily News wrote: "Last night (the 19th), it was learned that the Public Works Department seems to be taking swift action on the report of the Human-Powered Vehicle Committee. The report has been carefully studied by the Police Committee and the Traffic Committee. Yesterday, the two committees continued to hold a joint meeting. It is reported that it was resolved to petition the Public Works Department to immediately appoint one foreigner and two Chinese to form a special committee to implement the recommendations in items 4 to 16 of the report. These three people will all be paid. It was also learned from the Public Works Department that the Public Works Department is now very much in favor of reducing the total number of rickshaws. It is now believed that in the near future, when considering the whole issue of the current state of rickshaws in the concession, this section will also receive considerable attention."</p>
<p>The China Press wrote: "The Joint Committee of the Police Committee and the Traffic Committee will apply to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department tomorrow afternoon to entrust a paid committee of two Chinese and one foreigner to deal with the rickshaw problem and implement all the recommendations in the Human-Powered Vehicle Committee report except for the first three. They will also apply for further research on these three articles when discussing the details of the implementation of the entire plan in the future. According to reports today (20th) from responsible parties, these three articles have not been abolished, because the Joint Committee of the Police and Traffic Committees felt that they could not make a final decision on this matter, so they thought it was appropriate to postpone it."</p>

<p>In the Waterway from Yanhu to Anqing</p>
<p>According to reliable information from the naval authorities in this city, the Ministry of the Navy reported that a shingle slope has occurred on the left bank of the Shiqiao Channel in the section of the Yangtze River from Wuhu to Anqing. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Direction: On the left bank of the Tuqiao Channel, (A) 44 degrees north from Baiwu, distance 125 nautical miles, (B) 77.5 degrees north from Baiwu, distance 54 chains (every 10 chains equals one nautical mile), east longitude approximately 117 degrees 43 minutes, north latitude approximately 31 degrees 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Shape: The shingle slope extends from the shoreline into the river, extending half a chain at location (I) and one chain at location (II). (III) Depth: When the river water falls to the zero point of the water gauge, the stone slope is two feet above the water surface.

<h3 id="e97">Requesting Tax Refunds for Wheat Flour Sold Abroad <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Flour Manufacturers Petitioning the Ministries of Finance and Industry</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: The Shanghai Flour Industry Association and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Inland Mechanized Flour Industry Association yesterday submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Customs Administration, the National Tariff Commission, and other agencies, stating: "We are submitting this petition to request a refund of the imported wheat tax levied on wheat flour sold abroad and in the three northeastern provinces, in order to protect and promote competition. All countries in the world, in order to develop their foreign trade and encourage industrial and commercial enterprises, refund the imported raw material tariff to manufacturers whenever finished goods are sold abroad and the raw materials are purchased from abroad after being made into finished goods and reported for export. Also, the three northeastern provinces are the inherent sales market for flour factories across the country. Since your department ordered the Customs Administration to levy import taxes on foreign wheat, the cost of flour has increased, and its selling price is more than three jiao higher per bag than flour from Japan and Australia. Therefore, the sales in the three northeastern provinces have been completely cut off, and not even a single bag can be shipped. We are sitting idly by while Japanese and Australian flour is imported into the northeastern provinces, and we cannot compete with it. If we do not quickly seek a remedy, in the long run, not only will all of our country's flour factories inevitably shut down and reduce production, but also the government's tax revenue and the workers' livelihoods will be greatly affected. Our association has repeatedly discussed remedial measures, and the only option is to earnestly request your department to consider the commercial difficulties and follow the example of other countries in the world by refunding the imported wheat tariff already levied on the wheat flour produced by our association's factories when it is sold abroad and in the three northeastern provinces, in order to protect and promote competition. As for the tax refund method, it is proposed that the tariff levied on imported foreign wheat should be approximately 6.6 jiao in national currency per hundred catties, and each hundred catties of wheat can be processed into two bags of flour, then the import tariff on the raw material should be refunded at 3.3 jiao in national currency per bag of flour. The amount of tax refund should be limited to the amount of foreign wheat import tariffs paid by the manufacturers throughout the year. We earnestly request your department to approve our request, so that the production cost can be reduced and the sales channels can be competed for, so that there will be a glimmer of hope. The member factories of our association are eagerly awaiting your order. We respectfully submit this petition."</p>

<p>Extending the Account Period for Tax Payments</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports: The National Match Industry United Association previously requested the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Administration to change the tax account period to three months because the Ministry of Finance increased the total tax on each box of matches from 7.5 jiao to 17.4 jiao, and the match manufacturers had to temporarily pay the tax, and the association could not afford it. However, the Taxation Administration was unable to approve the request because it was related to the state treasury's revenue and expenditure. The association has now sent a second letter to the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Administration requesting assistance.</p>

<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association requesting discussion and reply on the tax rate, saying: "Dear Sirs, we have now received a joint petition from 24 cigarette companies, including the People's Company, stating that the current cigarette tax rates are unequal for Chinese and foreign companies, and requesting a prompt revision of the tax grades to provide assistance. In the past, according to the request of your association, the selling price of the second grade of cigarettes was relaxed to 300 yuan in order to reduce the restrictions on business. If the matter of revising the tax grades does not affect national tax revenue, and the opinions of the entire industry are consistent, and it can be implemented without hindrance, the Bureau will submit a report to request instructions for handling. We hereby send this letter to you, hoping that your association will study it in detail and reply with appropriate comments. Sincerely, to the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association."</p>
<h3 id="e100">After the Cigarette Tax Reform, the Sales of Domestic Tobacco Leaves Have Sharply Decreased <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the new two-grade cigarette tax, the domestic cigarette industry has been greatly affected due to the heavy tax on low-grade cigarettes, which has affected the domestic tobacco leaves that are the raw material for domestic cigarettes. According to the Xinsheng News Agency's investigation, the domestic tobacco leaves produced in Susong, Anhui; Huanggang and Guangshui, Hubei; Xinchang, Zhejiang; and Zhengzhou, Guanjun, and Junzhou, Henan, sold approximately 390,000 bales per year during the seven-grade tax period before 1919 of the Republic of China, each bale weighing approximately 250 pounds. After the three-grade tax was changed in November 1919, the sales volume decreased to 265,000 bales per year. Since the implementation of the two-grade tax in 1922 of the Republic of China, the annual sales are now only 115,000 bales. In addition to the small amount of locally produced cigarettes and a small amount of exports, the various Chinese and foreign mechanized cigarette factories no longer purchase them due to the high price. From this, it can be seen that the improper change of tax grades affects the livelihoods of farmers. In addition, the American tobacco leaves of Xuzhou, Fangzi, and Fenghuang Sanhao will inevitably be eliminated by this tax increase.</p>

<p>Petitioning for Increased Import Tariffs</p>
<p>The Chinese Chemical Industry Association, one of the well-known academic groups in China, aims to study chemical science and promote the chemical industry. Recently, in view of the basic chemical products imported from Europe, America, Japan, and Russia, such as soda ash, caustic soda, sodium sulfide, carbonic acid, calcium, magnesium sulfate, hydrochloric acid, bleaching powder, etc., the volume of goods shipped to China is like a tide, and the international exchange rate is low and the price of gold is falling, and the import tax is light, so low-price competition, a large number of dumping, and the cost of our basic industry is heavy, the selling price is low, and the market is lost, the future of national goods will be in danger, so the association's organization members Tianjin, Yongli Alkali Plant, Bohai Chemical Company, Shanghai Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, Kaicheng Acid Company, etc., petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan to implement tariff policies to increase the import tax on chemical products for relief.</p>
<h3 id="e102">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Informs the Customs to Correct the Valuation Standard of Flour <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jiang Customs Supervisor's Office yesterday requesting the correction of the valuation standard for flour exports. The original text reads: "Dear Sirs, according to the letter from the Flour Industry Association of this city, Mr. Zhao Shufang of the Laozuixiang Company, a member of the association, stated that the flour products of our industry have always been mainly aromatic powder oil, among which the sales of bottled powder are particularly widespread both domestically and abroad, and the four northeastern provinces are the most important markets. The raw materials used are purely domestic. The customs duty on goods is levied at 7.5%. However, customs officers increased the price to one silver cent per bottle (approximately 4.2 national currency cents). It is said that the customs officers inquired about the price in the Huajinli area. It is not known that the bottled powder in our industry has different prices for door-to-door sales and wholesale. The goods themselves are also different. Now, the valuation is more than doubled. Fortunately, the business was still good at that time, so we could bear the pain. Now, the situation has changed, and the business is declining. The four northeastern provinces are now occupied by the pseudo-Manchu. Sixty percent of the goods shipped there are subject to re-taxation. According to the customs valuation, a 60% tax is levied, resulting in a sharp increase in costs, and no one is advising us. Now, according to the joint announcement of the Hakka people in that area, we must seek help from each other at this time of national crisis. If the previously overvalued and falsely increased tariffs are not corrected, the sales channels will be cut off, and the future will be unimaginable. Therefore, we have made a special request for relief, requesting that the imaginary valuation be cancelled and that the bottled powder be allowed to be declared for export in accordance with the actual market price for tax payment, or that the invoice be presented for verification at the time of customs inspection, as a standard for valuation, so that it will be fair. If you are concerned about the credibility of this type of invoice, our association is willing to take full responsibility and provide a written guarantee, so that the country's taxes will not be hindered, and the business will be maintained, so that the surviving national flour can extend its life in the sunshine." According to the investigation, the sales of bottled aromatic powder in this industry are the most extensive in the four northeastern provinces. Now that they are occupied by the pseudo-Manchu,</p>
<p>a 60% ad valorem tax is levied on the import of this bottled powder, which is based on the price fixed by the Jiang Customs. And the price estimated by the Jiang Customs is still when the business is booming, regardless of the price of the door-to-door wholesale. According to the current market price, which is falling day by day, 60% of the estimated tax is levied on sales to the four northeastern provinces, no wonder its cost has suddenly risen, and the sales channel is in danger of disappearing. The industry association proposes to apply for certification and submit the invoice to the association to prove the standard of valuation, which is a fair and just proposal. Therefore, we hereby forward the information and request your office to verify it and quickly discuss it with the tax department and approve it as requested in order to maintain business.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau Was Ordered to Comply</p>
<p>The local Shipping Administration Bureau previously reported to the Wuhu Office requesting an explanation of the doubts about the measures to ban steamship companies. The bureau immediately forwarded the report to the Ministry of Communications for review. Now, it is known that the bureau received the following explanation from the Ministry of Communications yesterday: (1) The size of the shipping business is different, and the amount of capital is not limited. It should be determined according to the scope of the equipment and be sufficient for business use. Rental fees and docks are naturally part of the capital. If the competent shipping administration bureau considers it necessary to verify the deposit of the current capital in banks or money shops, it may verify it. The method of obtaining proof from three reliable local merchants may also be adopted. (2) Individuals engaged in shipping business should still be handled in accordance with the first item. (3) If the shipping route certificate has already been obtained, it is still valid if the original starting point is not followed and the intermediate point is used as the starting point. There is no need to change the shipping route certificate.</p>

<p>It Was Decided to Petition the Party and Government</p>
<p>And Issued a Call for Assistance Declaration</p>
<p>The local silk reeling industry, due to the impact of Japanese silk dumping in Europe and the United States, silk prices have fallen and sales have been sluggish, making it difficult for the factories to maintain their operations and closing down one after another. More than 80,000 workers have suddenly become unemployed, and their livelihoods are in danger. After joint discussions by the silk reeling associations in various districts, the Association to Aid Unemployed Workers was established and held its first meeting the day before yesterday, and issued a call for assistance declaration. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>First Meeting: The silk reeling associations in various districts of this city, because the resumption of silk mills is uncertain, and the government's assistance has not yet been realized, the workers are unemployed and terrified, convened a joint meeting of the silk reeling associations in various districts, established the Association to Aid Unemployed Workers, and held the first meeting at 2:00 pm yesterday, with more than 20 people attending, discussing the following proposals: (1) Elected Chen Xiupu, Yuan Yunlong, Yang Gengti, Le Xiaorong, and Yang Shumei as standing committee members; (2) Scheduled the start of registration of unemployed workers; (3) The association's expenses will be shared by the various district associations; (4) Omitted; (5) Issued a call for assistance declaration; (6) Each group will start work from now on; (7) Scheduled to petition the party and government agencies to request the implementation of measures to aid the silk industry.</p>
<p>Call for Assistance Declaration: The Shanghai Silk Reeling Industry Association to Aid Unemployed Workers issued a call for assistance declaration: "Since the opening of the five ports, due to the economic aggression of the great powers, the passive development of international trade has been created. Comparing the value of imported and exported goods over the years, there has been no year without an import surplus from 35 years before the Republic of China to the present for more than 50 years. The number of funds flowing to foreign countries is countless. How can our country not have economic deficits and the people are poor and the treasury is exhausted? Fortunately, raw silk is the main export, and the annual export value often reaches 160 to 70 million taels of customs silver, recovering benefits, which is not insignificant. In the Tongzhi and Guangxu years of the late Qing Dynasty, Chinese silk accounted for more than seven tenths of the raw silk sold in various countries around the world, so in the past, the position of Chinese silk in the world market can be said to be unparalleled. However, since then, due to the competition of Japanese silk, its position has been deteriorating. Although the export quantity of Chinese silk increased to nearly 190,000 dan in 1918 of the Republic of China, its value is no longer the same as before. In recent years, not only has the value fallen sharply, but also the export quantity has been drastically reduced, almost reaching a state where no one cares. The mulberry fields are abandoned, and the silk mills are closed down. Alas, the decline of the silk industry is extreme. Today, not only has the hope of using raw silk as the only way to reduce the import surplus become a bubble, but also the millions of people across the country who directly and indirectly rely on the silk industry for their livelihoods, how can they be well taken care of in the future? At present, no less than 60,000 to 70,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai are engaged in the silk mill business, waiting to be fed, and not guaranteeing the evening if they have a morning. If they do not quickly seek relief, the weak will wait to die, and the strong will take risks. Who can guarantee that there will be no such thing? If this continues, how can the social order and the economy of the common people be imagined? Although the National Economic Commission has organized a Silk Improvement Committee, it should be a fundamental solution to save</p>
<p>the silk industry, but what can be done about the water far away cannot put out the fire near? Therefore, the implementation of the policy of curing the symptoms by the administrative authorities is an urgent request of our workers and cannot be delayed. At the same time, we also hope that our compatriots at home and abroad will lend a helping hand, so that tens of thousands of workers and friends will not starve to death, and the country and society will benefit. When the association was first organized, I would like to say a few words as a dying cry and call for Jiang Bo. I hope you will take it into consideration. This is the declaration."</p>

<p>Request to Management Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Yesterday Filed with Party and Government Organs for Relief</p>
<p>After the Shanghai South Public Bus Company ceased operations, all ticket sellers, drivers, and ticket inspectors were laid off. Now, workers Qian Shun'gao, Qiao Wanghe, and others, considering that the Shanghai South Public Bus Company has been taken over by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and that the bureau is preparing to resume operations, especially dispatched representatives the other day to request the bureau, according to the second item of the resolution of the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation: 1. When the company resumes operation, all original workers shall return to work. The borrowed wages are allowed to be deducted in installments from the monthly salary. However, when the company reduces its scope and cannot hire all workers, it may hire from the original workers, but no new workers shall be recruited. 2. Permission to employ the original workers. The result was ineffective. Yesterday, they submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for relief, urging that they be fully employed in accordance with the settlement record.</p>

<p>Yang Yingdong, Ye Zaishun, Liu Weijie, Chen Chuanhong, Li Yongfu, etc., who went to Japan from Shanghai, were detained by the Kobe Maritime Police, not allowed to land, and ordered to return to China on the original ship. Also, Ni Chunsheng, Ye Baoqi, Yang Dangcheng, etc., who were in Higashi Ichida-cho, were expelled by the Japanese police for staying in Japan without employment and were all escorted back to Shanghai by ship yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Reforms Equipment of Various Ships, Dispute Resolved Over the Gonghe Steamer's Mess Staff <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Due to the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Gonghe steamer renovating the officer cabins into large second-class dining rooms and hiring Western stewards, the original officer cabin workers felt that the cabins were small and the jobs were few, affecting their livelihoods. They requested the company to assign some of the officer cabin workers to work in the second-class dining rooms to avoid unemployment, but the result was delayed, causing the workers to be indignant. When the ship departed from Shanghai last time, twelve people were pushed out to automatically participate in the second-class dining room, causing a dispute. It is learned that the company, considering the workers' enthusiastic participation in the second-class dining room work and being eager to resolve the issue and respect the union, has softened its attitude. Yesterday, it specially urged Secretary Sun Liping of the union by telephone to come to the company for consultation. General Manager Tude and Chief Inspector Bu Ermo received him. After mutual discussion, it was decided that the second-class dining room of the ship will use people from the stewards and officer cabin workers in equal proportions. However, the title of the workers dispatched from the officer cabins will still be called mess staff and cannot be called stewards, in order to distinguish them. As for the total number of people to be used, it has not yet been discussed at this time.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Committee previously decided to first try out a nursery and appointed Yang Maorong as the director. The location was selected at houses No. 1 to 7, Jinpanfang, near Penglai Road, Daximen. The committee repeatedly sent letters to the Second District, Second Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, notifying the tenants to move out. The tenants, due to the vital interests involved, argued on the basis of reason. Their reasons are briefly stated as follows: It is found that Jinpanfang is close to the Penglai Market, which is noisy all day long. Moreover, the houses there are isolated from each other and not connected at all. Furthermore, the tenants have lived there for many years, and their family members and children are all studying in nearby schools. Their fathers and brothers also work in the vicinity. Forcing them to move would cause them to lose their homes and cause great damage. Moreover, considering the municipal property, there is also the former site of the Qingjietang Land Bureau, Yishiyuan, slightly to the east of the site, and the surplus houses of Shangwen Primary School to the south. Therefore, they repeatedly requested Director Tang of the Second District to convey the situation. However, the committee approved the order and still ordered them to comply with the previous order to move out. Unexpectedly, the other day, Yang Maorong even forced the tenants to move out together with patrol officers from the Second District, causing the tenants to feel aggrieved and aroused public anger. It is now learned that the tenants have united as one and are planning to deal with the situation together. On the one hand, they have hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit and seek legal relief. On the other hand, they have issued a declaration seeking assistance from all sectors of society.</p>

<p>Traffic Blocked on Nanjing Road for 20 Minutes</p>
<p>Three Men and One Woman Injured, One Rickshaw Destroyed</p>
<p>In the past few days, the weather in this port has been unusually cold, like severe winter weather. On the 18th and 19th, it suddenly turned warm again, with a gentle breeze blowing, like the season of early spring. However, those who suffered from diseases due to the abnormal climate were everywhere, especially the prevalence of smallpox and diphtheria. Unexpectedly, by yesterday afternoon, the weather changed again. Rain fell lightly. Condition of the Tumble-Down Wall of the Bowling Alley (Photo by Qichang)</p>
<p>The north wind howled, and compared with the temperature in the previous days, the difference reached ten degrees. By 6 PM, a sudden hurricane arose, and the roads were muddy. Therefore, pedestrians who lost their footing and fell to the ground, as well as those who lost their hats and umbrellas, could be seen everywhere. There were also countless shop signs on various roads that were blown down. Rickshaw pullers were all complaining bitterly. By 6:20 PM, the momentum was even greater. Where the hurricane passed, it howled, and trees were broken and walls collapsed. At 6:25 PM, just as the gale was howling, the cement parapet on the roof of No. 121, Shenchang Watch &amp; Clock General Store, No. 129, Shichangtai General Store (i.e., the entrance of Ciyu Lane), No. 133, No. 135, Datong Leather Shoe Factory, and No. 137, No. 139, Xiao Lüsong Hat Cleaning General Store, all properties of Hardoon Foreign Firm at the bowling alley on Nanjing Road, collapsed from the highest point with a roar due to years of disrepair and severe erosion. For a time, bricks and tiles flew together, and the momentum was like a landslide and tsunami. The traffic in that section was immediately blocked by cement bricks and ash. At the same time, men Lu Xingzhi, 32 years old, Cao Songcai, 21 years old, shoemaker Wang Jindi, 26 years old, and a woman passed by on the sidewalk and were injured by the cement bricks. There was also a rickshaw parked by the roadside that was destroyed. Fortunately, the Central Police Station learned of this and immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to suppress the situation and prohibit traffic. They also notified the Central Fire Brigade to send firefighters and ambulances to help the injured out and send them to Renji and other hospitals for treatment. Except for shoemaker Wang Jindi, who was seriously injured in the head and waist and was hospitalized for treatment, the others were slightly injured and left the hospital after being bandaged. On the one hand, the firefighters quickly cleared the road, and by 7:20 PM, traffic was restored. All the trams, cars, and buses stopped along Nanjing Road from the east to the Bund Waibaidu Bridge and west to the New World had been winding like long snakes for about ten minutes before returning to normal. However, the wind had not subsided slightly by the time the reporter finished writing.</p>

<p>Handwritten Order for the Detective Team to Investigate and Arrest</p>
<p>Two Cases Cracked in the Past Two Days</p>
<p>Captain Lu of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, acting on Director Wen's handwritten order, cracked a red pill manufacturing site at Guangqi Road, Second Precinct, First District, at about 9 PM the night before last. Five people were arrested on the spot, along with nine red pill guns and other evidence. The authorities have interrogated them on file. Yesterday, Captain Lu again acted on Director Wen's handwritten order that there was a red pill manufacturing site at No. 20, Lane 72, Anren Street, Second Precinct, First District, and immediately went to investigate and arrest secretly together with the police brigade. Chief Hong immediately dispatched Squad Leader Zhan and police officer Ren Yuekui and others from the Second Precinct of the First District to search and arrest. Zhang Baishi (25 years old, from Hangzhou) and Luo Hengxin (46 years old, from Shanghai) were arrested on the spot, along with six packages of red and white pills, two packages of medicine powder, one package of red color, two opium pipes, and other items. They were taken to the precinct and briefly interrogated by Director Liu before being handed over to the officers to be taken to the bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Rural Improvement Association, in order to assist farmers' economy and promote the development of production undertakings, has set up a rural loan office. It has raised a principal of 3,000 yuan, which will be distributed to various districts. Each district will be allocated a provisional principal of 500 yuan, which will be received and lent out by the districts. If it is managed effectively, it will be expanded. Kang Jimin has been appointed as the director of the office, and the heads of each district will be the directors of the branch offices. The county government has now approved the association's letter to the county, so it issued an order to each district yesterday to prepare for the establishment of loan branch offices and handle the matter conscientiously. It is reported that this loan is divided into two types: ordinary and special. The ordinary loan is from one yuan to ten yuan, and the special loan shall not exceed fifty yuan per household. If the farmer has legitimate uses, he may seek a reputable guarantor to apply for a loan. However, the special loan must have considerable collateral, with a monthly interest rate of 1.2%, calculated daily.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Small Shop Assistant Pretends to Be a Great Lawyer <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Hu Minggao Pretends to Be Wu Zhifen, Passing Off One Thing for Another</p>
<p>Extortionate Demands and Fraudulent Practices Exposed and Reported</p>
<p>Hu Minggao, from Chongming Qidong County, is 47 years old this year. He used to work as a shop assistant at Wang Zhidai's small cigarette and paper shop opposite the Puyi Skills Training Center on Nanshi Railway Station Road. In his spare time, he wrote guarantees and other documents for litigants. Over time, he became familiar with litigation procedures, so he left Wang Zhidai and rented a room under the Tongchun Tea House at No. 7 Tingxi Road, specializing in soliciting lawsuits and making friends with bailiffs and clerks to facilitate connections. His livelihood was not bad. However, Hu was still not satisfied. He learned that the lawyer's license and certificate of Wu Zhifen, a lawyer from Jing County, Anhui (whether he changed to another business or passed away is unknown), were sold to Hu Shi Gao through an intermediary. Thus, he was able to impersonate him and jump to become a lawyer. In July of last year, he asked four people, including his fellow villager, lawyer Yin Long, to help him provide a certificate so that he could join the Shanghai Bar Association. He still hung his signboard at the original address and performed his duties. Since then, his business has become even more prosperous. Recently, because Hu made excessive demands while handling a certain case and practiced fraudulent means under the guise of "movement," the client was deeply dissatisfied and secretly reported to the District Court Procuratorate Hu's impersonation and extortionate fraud and other secret history. Chief Prosecutor Lou knew that this person was often in front of the court and feared that he might leak information and escape. Therefore, he immediately secretly sent a letter to the Second District Police Station of the Public Security Bureau, requesting his arrest. District Chief Li secretly dispatched detectives who went to No. 7 Tingxi Road the night before last without making a sound, arrested Hu Minggao, and brought back his signboard and documents to the district. After a brief interrogation, he was transferred to the local court yesterday for interrogation and investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Zhang Zhuying's Son Da Yuan Is Born to Zhou Yuexuan <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Da Yuan's Blood Is the Same as Zhang and Zhou's</p>
<p>Verified by the Forensic Laboratory</p>
<p>Zhou Yuexuan, the eldest son of Zhou Weisheng, the owner of Zhou Gengji Yarn Shop, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou residing in Shanghai, once had a free love affair with Zhang Zhuying and lived together in a rented house at No. 8 Xinglongfang, Danshui Road. Soon, a son was born, named Da Yuan. However, before long, Zhou Weisheng learned of it and dissolved the small family formed by his son. Yuexuan, fearing the strict order, had no choice but to separate from Zhuying. The child was raised by Zhang, and the necessary living expenses each month were provided by Yuexuan until last autumn. Da Yuan was already eight years old when Yuexuan suddenly stopped paying the monthly fee, causing the child's life to become unstable. The child's mother, Zhang Zhuying, then filed a criminal lawsuit against Zhou Yuexuan for malicious abandonment in the First Special District Court on behalf of her child. After repeated summons and trials, the defendant categorically denied having a physical relationship with Zhang Zhuying. Trial Judge Wu Xiangzu, in order to discover the truth and avoid injustice, issued a notice to the forensic examination on file. It is now learned that the First Special Court has sent Zhang Zhuying, Zhou Yuexuan, and Da Yuan to the Forensic Research Institute of the Ministry of Justice Administration in Zhenru for examination according to law. The director of the institute, Lin Ji, made a register of the examination results and replied to the court. The content generally stated that Da Yuan's blood was completely the same as that of Zhou Yuexuan and Zhang Zhuying, and Da Yuan's appearance and bone structure were mostly very similar to Yuexuan and slightly similar to Zhang Zhuying, confirming that the child was indeed born to Zhou and Zhang. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu held a court session to continue the trial. First, he handed the examination report from the Forensic Research Institute to the defendant Zhou Yuexuan in court for review. Zhou then said that he had never had a relationship with Zhang and was surprised that the institute's appraisal showed that the child was born to him. Then he said that we are all yellow people, and our appearances are naturally mostly the same. If Da Yuan's blood is similar to mine, and it is determined that Da Yuan was born to me, then Zhang Zhuying and I have no father-daughter relationship, so why is our blood the same? The court considered that the defendant's argument was mere words. Therefore, it was ordered that if he wanted to deny it, he should submit definite evidence to the contrary. At this time, the defendant's lawyer requested a new appraisal and raised the issue of the jurisdiction of the trial level, saying that although the plaintiff's prosecution articles belonged to the primary level, the nature of the case was a local case. Judge Wu made an oral ruling, believing that there was no need for a new appraisal, and the issue of the trial level was still to be tried as a primary-level case, and there was no reason for change. Then, after re-examining Zhang Zhuying's time of birth of Da Yuan, and because the witnesses summoned had not arrived, he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the afternoon of March 31.</p>

<p>Court Still Needs to Summon Witnesses for Further Trial</p>
<p>Doctor Ding Jinan, at about 8 PM the day before yesterday, was driving his private car No. 2064 and passed in front of the Grand Guangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. He inadvertently overturned rickshaw No. 3282 while avoiding a motorcycle, and the passenger, Shen Liansheng from Nanxun, was fatally injured. The First Special Court has verified the body. The police considered that Ding was indeed at fault for causing the death and ordered him to be released on bail for 1,000 yuan in cash. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court. Judge Wu Tingqi heard the case, and Ding hired lawyer Gu Gongbing to defend him. The family of the deceased also hired a lawyer to bring a civil suit, demanding compensation for damages and solatium. After Judge Wu heard the case, he ordered a retrial to be scheduled after summoning witnesses. Ding Jinan added a deposit of 2,000 yuan and was ordered to submit a bail bond within three days.</p>

<p>The case of Zhang Jiping, editor-in-chief of the Shanghai Shangbao, being sentenced to four months' imprisonment by the First Special Court for publishing news about the Xu case caused an uproar. The Daily Newspaper Association and the Reporters Association held several meetings to discuss and unanimously support him. The central government also had clear orders to protect the news business and telegraphed to handle the case solemnly. All sectors of society paid close attention to this. The case was heard on the 13th of this month after the appeal, and the conclusion of the debate was announced, with the sentencing scheduled for the 20th. Yesterday was the date for the sentencing of the case. At 2 PM, Court President Qian Hongye ascended to the first criminal court and announced that the original sentence was revoked. Zhang Jiping was fined 400 yuan for disseminating the text. Zhang did not appear in court yesterday and was represented by lawyer Jiang Chiting. Although he was unwilling to accept the judgment, the legal proceedings of the case had come to an end, and there was no way to provide relief. Therefore, the Wen'an Prison incident, which had caused a sensation for a time, has come to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Boxer Shen Buyun Loses His Life in a Fight <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Instigator Surrenders to Police Station</p>
<p>Shen Buyun, a Tianjin native residing at No. 178 Huixiang Lane, Xilu, Xieqiao, Huajie, 31 years old, was skilled in boxing and made a living by performing. His business card, which he used for daily meetings, was printed with "Martial Arts Teacher of Yadon Middle and Small Day and Night School." He cohabited with a woman surnamed Tang (30 years old this year) from Songjiang. Shen, at 8:30 PM on the 18th, at the invitation of his friend Lü Wencai, also known as "Little Sanzi," brought his son's toys and went to the entrance of the Jiangbei Theater in the Minyeyuan at No. 86, Forty Head, Dushanfu Road, French Concession, to fight with someone. At that time, there were more than 20 people who had been invited to the scene by both sides, and the crowd was noisy and caused a great stir among the onlookers. Unexpectedly, although Shen called himself a martial arts teacher, he was struck in the head, right forehead, and back of the head by the other party with a triangular iron rod. Detectives heard the noise and rushed to disperse the onlookers and arrest the perpetrators. When the people from both sides and their accomplices saw the detectives arriving, they all fled from the crowd. Shen also fled back to his home at this time. However, the patrolman in the crowd saw that Liu Fugui (24 years old), from Shandong, was still holding an iron rod in his hand, knew that he was the perpetrator, and arrested him and took him to the police station for interrogation. Liu denied instigating the fight. The police chief ordered him to be detained for investigation and to arrest the fleeing accomplices for interrogation. However, after Shen returned home, his injuries became serious. The next day (19th) at about 8 AM, his wife, Tang, accompanied him to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road, Public Concession, for treatment. He died at 2:30 PM due to excessive head injuries, and the hospital reported to the Xinza Police Station, which notified the French Police Station to send detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for autopsy. On the one hand, detectives went to the scene of the incident to investigate the circumstances of the fight. At 5 PM, Lü Wencai, who had invited Shen to fight, learned of Shen's death and surrendered to the French Police Station for investigation. Yesterday morning, the police station reported to the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court and requested the appointment of Prosecutor Wang Ren and forensic officers to come to the hall at noon to verify the body and ascend to the public case. First, Patrol Chief Chang Chunsheng reported on the investigation process. Shen Tang, the wife of the deceased, testified that her husband had gone out at about 8 PM that evening, saying he was going to the theater, and did not mention anything about going to fight. At 9 PM, he returned home injured. When I asked him, he said that someone was fighting and he went up to dissuade them, resulting in him being injured. The next day, I accompanied him to the hospital for treatment, but he died. Now I am willing to collect the body for burial. Prosecutor Wang verified the testimony and ordered that Shen Buyun had indeed died due to injuries sustained before death. The body was collected by the deceased's wife, Shen Tang, for burial, and the perpetrators should be dealt with by the Police Department according to law. It is rumored that wanted criminal Yang Dafuzi is at large and has not been apprehended. Now, the police are conducting a thorough investigation into the truth of the incident and arresting the perpetrators.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Forging as Many as 50,000 Cigarette Coupons <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yu Azhang Exchanges for Three Cups Brand Cigarettes at Cigarette Shops Everywhere</p>
<p>Several Thousand Packs of Cigarettes Have Been Exchanged Before Being Cracked the Other Day</p>
<p>Recently, Dexing Tobacco Company on Zhejiang Road issued a type of Three Cups Brand cigarette coupon. Anyone who obtains a coupon can exchange it for a box of Three Cups Brand cigarettes at any cigarette shop. Unexpectedly, A'zhang, Shi Wangshi, Shi Xixiang, Fang Changfu, and others from Ningbo recently contracted with a printing house to print forged coupons, totaling 50,000. They also forged the official seal of Dexing Tobacco Company. In recent days, they have set out separately, carrying forged coupons, to mix in various cigarette shops in the Chinese and rental districts. However, the cigarette shops were negligent for a while, and the coupons were well-made, so they were deceived. In the past few days, Yu and others have used thousands of forged coupons to exchange for thousands of packs of cigarettes. At about 9 PM the day before yesterday, Shi Xixiang and Fang Changfu were again carrying rattan baskets and hiding forged coupons, starting to mix in various cigarette shops in the Public Concession. When they went to Futa Cigarette Shop at No. 131 Changsha Road to use them, the shop's bookkeeper, Shao Minggeng, noticed that the coupons were forged. Therefore, he argued with Shi and others. At that time, Ma Shicai, a runner for Dexing Tobacco Company, passed by and asked about the situation and confirmed that the coupons were indeed forged. Therefore, he reported to Chinese Patrolman No. 905, who brought Shi and Fang to the Xinza Police Station. Chief Chinese Detective Su Yinggen and Patrolman Yang Youshan searched Shi and found 25 forged coupons and one genuine coupon. They searched the rattan basket and found 216 packs of Three Cups Brand cigarettes. They then joined forces with detectives from the Public Security Bureau to arrest Yu Azhang and Shi Wangshi at No. 102 Dajing Road, Xiaobeimen, Nanshi. More than 40,000 forged coupons were found upstairs and temporarily detained at the Public Security Bureau, pending a written request for transfer. Yesterday morning, the police station first sent Shi and Fang to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case, saying that there were still Yu Azhang and Yu Wangshi, who were currently detained at the Public Security Bureau, and requested a written request for transfer. Questioning Shi and Fang, they admitted that Yu Azhang was involved in the forged coupons. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the testimony and ordered Shi and others to be detained for a retrial at a later date.</p>

<p>Willing to be Exploited by Local Bullies to Maintain Private Interests</p>
<p>Undermining the Establishment of Ferry Services, Disregarding Public Welfare</p>
<p>国民社 reports that the Municipal Government, for the sake of facilitating public travel, intends to establish ferry services at Dongjiadu. Unexpectedly, a segment of boatmen and workers, under the guise of the Dongjiadu Ferry Workers' Union, have risen up in opposition, attempting to sabotage it. The Municipal Party Headquarters, considering that the union has not been approved and registered, and its activities are evidently illegal, yesterday specially instructed the First and Fifth District Party Headquarters to jointly and strictly prohibit them. Here is the original order: "For compliance, it is hereby ordered that the Dongjiadu Ferry Workers' Union has not been submitted to this headquarters for approval and registration, and its organization is illegal and has long been revoked. This time, the Municipal Government's establishment of ferry services is based on the request of the people of the district, to facilitate public travel. Unexpectedly, the original boatmen and workers of the ferry are ignorant and foolish, rising up in opposition, willingly being exploited by local bullies, attempting to undermine the establishment of ferry services, maintaining private interests, and disregarding public welfare, which is entirely inappropriate. In addition to separate orders to the First and Fifth District Party Headquarters, it is urgently ordered that the union comply, quickly jointly prohibiting the boatmen and workers of the ferry from being exploited by others to oppose the establishment of ferry services, and they are not allowed to use the name of the union to assemble, petition, or incite disturbances, so as to benefit the municipality. Upon receipt of this order, act immediately, without any delay or mistake, this order is imperative."</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Public Works Department and Industry Within the Settlement <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Work Report for the Previous Year</p>
<p>Negotiations Stalled The Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement, in its work report for the previous year, mentioned the state of industry within the settlement. It stated, "Since 1931, when the Chinese government announced the implementation of the Factory Law, the Public Works Department also declared its principled support for the industrial management. Subsequently, two representatives from the International Labour Office came to Shanghai, and the Ministry of Industry invited representatives from the three municipal districts of Shanghai to informally consult on everything. In 1932, due to the situation, progress came to a halt. In March of last year, the Director-General of the Public Works Department and the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government discussed the issue of factory inspections. The Public Works Department, based on the consultations of 1931, put forward three points: 1) The Public Works Department is prepared to employ factory inspectors recommended by the Chinese government; 2) Inspection reports will be submitted to the Chinese government on a regular basis, in accordance with the agreed-upon format; 3) The inspectors from the three municipal districts can agree to meet once a month. However, the government's 'supervision' of inspectors within the settlement should not include jurisdictional authority, and the correspondence between the inspectors and the government should be forwarded through the Public Works Department." This proposal was not agreed to by the Chinese side. Later, it was discussed to form an inspection office, jointly directed by the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government and the Director-General of the Public Works Department, but the board of directors believed that the jurisdiction of the inspectors could not be divided, so it was not accepted either. After mid-October, these negotiations came to a standstill.</p>
<p>Accident Incidents Statistics for the first eight months of the previous year regarding industrial accident incidents within the settlement show 163 workers injured and 120 killed, totaling 283 people. Among them, 155 were male and 128 were female. The biggest cause of death and injury was explosions, with 44 deaths and injuries; falls accounted for 48; electricity, 19; fire, 19; and contusions, 18. Among them, 42 were construction workers. Factory fires accounted for 28.15% of the fires within the settlement, and the fire losses accounted for 49.9% of the total amount.</p>
<p>Suppressing Construction Because smaller factories within the settlement have difficulty obtaining land, there are frequent cases of converting alleyway houses into factories, resulting in various dangers. The Public Works Department has now notified those applying for Chinese-style housing licenses that they are not allowed to add or demolish walls without authorization. The construction or reconstruction of factories will be strictly inspected by the Works Department at any time. In addition to the construction of houses, the Public Works Department will pay attention to the electrical installations and equipment containing pressure components in the factories in order to reduce danger.</p>
<h3 id="e122">The Two-Roads Administration Responds to the Chamber of Commerce Regarding the Relocation of the Panjiwan Wooden Bridge <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Two-Roads Administration yesterday replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Having received your letter 商字 No. 805, regarding the preservation of the wooden bridge at the east end of the Zhabei Bridge, this Bureau has successively received petitions from merchants and residents in the area and instructed the Vehicle, Mechanical, and Engineering Departments to deliberate and respond, stating, 'The addition of a concrete wall from Maigen Road to Bridge No. 1 is being carried out under the Bureau's order. There are three necessary reasons: 1) Without a wall, it is difficult for road police to investigate and prevent thieves from mixing into the Maigen Road warehouses; 2) According to statistics from the Vehicle Department, an average of one ignorant and foolish person is crushed to death by trains each month for taking the small wooden bridge; 3) The shanties of the poor encroach on the road boundaries, creating filth and mess, which must be blocked by a wall. If we follow the request of the shops, the original intention of adding the wall will be completely ineffective. Also, the area along Jiaotong Road is full of factories and residents. Most of those who travel between Panjiwan and Jiaotong Road are ordinary people and small workers. Before January 28th, vendors and small shops were all set up on Jiaotong Road, so fewer people traveled across the small wooden bridge. Now, as a result of police intervention, they have all moved to Bridge No. 1 south of the railway tracks, so even more people travel across the small wooden bridge every day. However, if the residents of Panjiwan take Tanziwan Road, they can also reach Jiaotong Road. Therefore, we believe the best solution is for the shops to request the Shanghai Municipal Government to build a bridge south of Railway Bridge No. 1, across the Suzhou Creek, and open a road from this bridge to Tanziwan Road. This Bureau has a half-traffic point on Tanziwan Road, so people traveling through this point can pass through the tracks without danger. Before this plan is realized, it is proposed to temporarily move the current small wooden bridge to a point 10 meters away from Railway Bridge No. 1, and build an underground passage on the east bank, passing through the railway, to maintain traffic in the Panjiwan area. We await your inspection and verification as to whether this is appropriate." After reviewing the above, the proposed measures are appropriate. In addition to instructing that the proposal be approved, and separately replying to the merchants and residents, this letter is accordingly delivered, hoping you will investigate and comply accordingly."</p>

<p>The Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Railways Administration, regarding the free storage period for goods stored in railway warehouses by merchants, extended it from 24 hours to 7 days in mid-June of last year, and appropriately reduced the storage fees for overdue goods. When the two-month trial period ended in mid-September, it was again approved by the Ministry of Railways to extend the period for six months. Subsequently, due to the fact that the Maigen Road warehouse was completely full, in order to alleviate congestion, it was decided that from November 3rd, the free storage period for goods in that warehouse would be temporarily changed from 7 days to 5 days, and the storage fees for fourth-class and lower-class goods would also be temporarily charged at the rate of third-class goods (5 fen per ton per day). Now, the Railway Administration has approved the return of the free storage period for all goods arriving at the Maigen Road warehouse to 7 days. After this specified date, the storage fee rates for fourth-class and lower-class goods, which were originally charged at the rate of third-class goods, will be changed to be calculated according to the original grade, that is, 5 li per 50 kilograms or less for less-than-carload shipments, and 2.5 li per ton for carload shipments, effective from March 20th.</p>

<p>To the editor,</p>
<p>According to the advertisements in various newspapers on the 10th of this month, the notice of the Shanghai Office of the China Aviation Association for soliciting captains of the general team included a list of teams that had not paid their donations in full. It stated that Lu Wenshao, captain of the third team, had raised 1,000 yuan but had not yet paid it. It has been verified that Mr. Lu previously donated 5,000 yuan for the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce aircraft to this association, and he did not intend to donate this amount. This matter was approved by a letter from the office on July 28th of the previous year, inquiring whether Mr. Lu had remitted the 1,000 yuan he had pledged to donate to the association. After inquiring about Mr. Lu's opinion, a letter No. 321 of the Pu character was sent in reply. This is obviously inconsistent with the sections reported by the office, which is likely to cause misunderstandings among outsiders. It is necessary to make a factual correction. Now, according to Mr. Lu's request to send a letter on his behalf to clarify the foregoing, in addition to sending a letter to the office requesting correction, we also request that your newspaper disclose this letter to clarify the truth. We hope for this.</p>

<h3 id="e143">How to Study the Northeast Problem <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Reading Guidance Department:</p>
<p>Your department is responsible for guiding all young people—not only guiding readers, but also guiding the resolution of all practical problems. Therefore, I would like to propose this already forgotten but most important issue—the Northeast problem—and ask your department to propose an open discussion.</p>
<p>Japan's military occupation of the Northeast has become a thing of the past. Now it has begun a "root and branch" extermination policy. Japan is implementing this policy by many means. Due to space limitations, I can only write down a few of the most vicious means below.</p>
<p>(1) Implementing National Subjugation Education</p>
<p>Japan wants to make the 30 million people of Northeast China its slaves forever. The first thing to do is to implement slave education. Most of the universities and middle schools in the Northeast have been closed, and the elementary schools are only half-dead. The education departments of the provinces of the Northeast have set up curriculum editing committees to compile national subjugation textbooks. There are now many publications, the content of which is completely麻醉ideology to eliminate the soul. Japanese language is added for several hours a week in all elementary and middle schools. Japanese people are hired as teachers, in name as teachers, but in reality to supervise whether there are any anti-Japanese or anti-Manchu actions. If this continues, in five or ten years, the youth of the Northeast will not only not know how to love the country and save the country, but will also be completely Japanized and forget their motherland.</p>
<p>(2) Oppressing Intellectuals</p>
<p>Japan is even more cruel to intellectuals, using "dropping stones down a well." After the Incident, most intellectuals fled and disappeared, and news of open and secret killings was heard every day. Japanese plainclothes detectives are all over the cities of the Northeast, arbitrarily going to homes to search and inspect. Even if they find a magazine, you will be falsely accused of being a reactionary and arrested and imprisoned. As a result, all books have been burned clean. Some escaped intellectuals have also fled east and west, displaced. All that remains are some muddle-headed fools. Japan has also used various threats and oppressions against them to make them forget their motherland. A puppet emperor was established to 麻醉them. How can these fools, full of feudal ideas, see through this trick?</p>
<p>(3) Forcibly Eliminating the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>After the "September 18th" Incident, the Volunteer Army in the Northeast rose up like a storm, almost everyone was a soldier, and no one was not brave. Full of𤍠blood, they confronted the Japanese soldiers, who were well-equipped with精and彈, with bare hands. But now they are dying one by one. Their power is diminishing day by day. Although there are some remnants, they are also on their last breath, living from day to day. In order to completely eliminate the Volunteer Army, Japan has stationed strong troops in various places, and ordered that no tall sorghum crops be planted within 60 li of the railway line to prevent the Volunteer Army from hiding. The strictness of the measures can be described as meticulous. The Volunteer Army, which is enough to kill Japan, is probably about to be eliminated soon!</p>
<p>(4) Implementing a Poisoning Policy</p>
<p>Japan wants to make the 30 million people of the Northeast its slaves forever, so it implements a poisoning policy. It forces various places to plant opium. Since the "September 18th" Incident, the general farmers have seen the bankruptcy of the countryside and the failure to recover. In order to make a living, they have no time to consider the pros and cons, and they are all competing to plant opium. It is heard that the area planted has accounted for about 10% of the cultivated land. Since planting is officially allowed, smoking is naturally open. There are more than a thousand opium dens in major cities in the Northeast. Each opium den hires female attendants to serve smokers, and outside hires ruffians to "attract customers." In the streets and alleys, there are cries such as "The opium is delicious" and "The female attendants are beautiful." In order to implement the "addiction to smoking and sex" strategy, Japan clearly allows opium dens to openly accommodate smokers, just like brothels. Generally, young people who are not addicted to smoking are also addicted to sex. They lie in bed all day long, playing the flute, their ambitions are becoming more and more depressed, and their bodies are becoming weaker and weaker. Japan is only using this poisoning policy, which is enough to control the death of our 30 million compatriots in the Northeast and more! How painful!</p>
<p>Based on the above vicious means, Japan has made the greatest determination to destroy the Northeast. In order to maintain "territorial integrity," we should fight him to the death, but the opposite is true. We only see champagne celebrations and puppet ascensions, and we do not ask about the detailed plan for resisting Japan. As for the people, what about them? Recalling the time of the "September 18th" Incident, the whole country was boiling and the people were extremely激昂. The cry of "Resisting Japan and saving the country" was deafening. Strikes, market closures, petitions, and donations were all like "hitting the three ghost islands with one cannon and drinking a cup of wine in Huanglong." After a few days of commotion, the flags and drums were silenced, and the atmosphere was peaceful again. Movie theaters were full, and a film could be shown continuously for more than a month, and it was crowded every time. How prosperous it can be said! High-class Chinese people are high夫during the day and foxtrotting at night, clearly a "prosperous and peaceful country" that has no "national crisis" look. The government is so perfunctory, and the people's spirit is so depressed. Can the future still be imagined!</p>
<p>Editors: I cannot bear to see the country broken without resistance and the home lost without a price. I cannot bear to hear the heartbreaking cries of 30 million compatriots in the deep water. I want to take my whole life, a腔𤍠blood, and join comrades to save the Northeast, and make it my lifelong career, and do it without loosening a step. I now want to bury myself in the study of the Northeast problem thoroughly, as a south針for future work. But the Northeast problem is not a simple problem! Its outbreak was not accidental. My lack of knowledge and weak ability make me feel difficult about this problem. However, my ambition has been decided, and I cannot挫去it even a little because of the difficulty. I dare to ask your department to help me achieve my ambition and give me a helping hand, and guide me in detail to a research path. I am waiting earnestly for your reply. (A letter from Fang Juemeng, a refugee from the Northeast)</p>

<h3 id="e145">Goldfish and the Two Sus <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>▼ Su Zimei waited for goldfish all day long</p>
<p>.▼ Su Dongpo considered it an honor to see golden carp in Nanping</p>
<p>The goldfish that modern people see are not uncommon. Before the Song Dynasty, no one played with them. Although Tang Dynasty officials had the title of "赐紫金鱼袋" [bestowed purple gold fish pouch], the purple gold fish pouch hanging on the waist was only a kind of "彰君之宠" [showing the emperor's favor] like jade fish and golden turtle pendants, and it was absolutely different from the goldfish that are played with now.</p>
<p>Now, even three-year-old children know goldfish; the ancients were not like that. Su Zimei and Su Dongpo in the Northern Song Dynasty were both regarded as learned gentlemen; who knows, when they saw golden carp, it was like a country bumpkin touring the Shanghai Bund, with a great look of "never seen before." Su Zimei even wanted to see goldfish and waited respectfully by the bridge all day long; forty years later, Su Dongpo read Su Zimei's two lines of poetry, "waiting for golden carp by the bridge, lingering alone all day long," and he was a bit inexplicable about the words "golden carp." Later, he went to the place where Zimei wrote poetry—the Liuhe Pagoda Temple—and saw golden fish in the pond, and he knew the origin of the words "golden carp." Dongpo was extremely happy. Not only did he describe this in Dongpo's poetry talks, but he also had a proud poem that said, "I know the golden carp of Nanping." Something that modern three-year-old children know, Su Dongpo composed poems about, and considered it an honor to know it. This is because of the times, and we cannot laugh at him for being 少见多怪 [seeing little and marveling at much].</p>
<p>Books recording goldfish all say: "The practice of raising goldfish became popular after the Southern Song Dynasty." Therefore, people in the Northern Song Dynasty always regarded the knowledge of goldfish as something surprising. Su Zimei was the first to appreciate goldfish, and more than forty years later, Su Dongpo followed. Apart from the two Sus, it would be very difficult to find a few poems about goldfish among the people of the Northern Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>Goldfish gardens are also one of the three hundred and sixty trades. Since there is a trade, there should be a respected patriarch. I think Su Zimei can be the founding patriarch of the goldfish industry. As for other people to be worshipped, old beard uncle Su Dongpo is 大槪 [probably] not un祧 [removed from the ancestral tablet].</p>
<h3 id="e146">Returning from Hongqiao Airfield <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Nanhai Shagou</p>
<p>"Naming Ceremony of Tianchu Aircraft," "Handover Ceremony of Yuehui Aircraft," "Aerobatic Performance of Aircraft Squadrons" - these large-character headlines stirred the curiosity of the broad masses in Shanghai. Cars, bicycles, rickshaws and pedestrians on the Hongqiao Road kicked up yellow dust for a time, thronging forward. I was one of them.</p>
<p>The weather that day was very spring-like, and people seemed to be in the mood for spring. The left half of the airfield, cordoned off, near the newly-built but unfinished hangars, was already a seething mass of heads. Fourteen aircraft were lined up in a row, with the Tianchu Zheng Aircraft, the fighter - fitted with machine guns - the Fu Aircraft, and the "Yuehui" and "Yuewen" aircraft placed in the centre, facing the temporary canopy of the auditorium.</p>
<p>Three o'clock struck, and at the sound of military music, the big shots on stage - those who donated the aircraft, those who received them, representatives of the government, officials from the Aeronautics Association, Aviation School, and Flying Club - proceeded to deliver the usual speeches. No loudspeakers had been set up on stage, and it could be safely said that what was being said could not be heard clearly beyond five paces. Fortunately, the audience's purpose was to see the aircraft display. The sensational speeches were left to the journalists to record.</p>
<p>The movement of the military band towards the aircraft bodies of the "Tianchu" indicated that the christening was about to begin. At this instant, a single spark on the northeast corner of the airfield suddenly began to burn across the winter-unmown reeds, and a southwest wind fanned it into a prairie fire. Armed police blew whistles and everyone threw their coats over it and tried to put it out. But the wind was strong and the grass was dry, and the flames snaked toward the northeast, forcing another group to quickly move the Eurasia Numbers 3 and 4 aircraft which had been parked there, narrowly averting disaster. Had there been fewer people, or had they been slower to act, several aircraft would have been offered to the "God of Fire" in moments! - The aromatic grass covering the airfield was simply a danger, a discarded cigarette end could turn into a bomb!</p>
<p>The propellers - the propellers - on the aircraft began to turn with a 地"地" [slow and heavy] sound, and the booming roar shocked the audience's eardrums, making the air tense. The "Yuewen" took off first, gracefully making several revolutions. Next came an aerobatic performance by the "Tianchu" fighter, which shot swiftly down and then surged 　, making several loops, to enthusiastic applause from the whole airfield. To conclude, the instructors from the aviation school, piloting the "Shanghai City", "Shanghai Business", "Shanghai Workers", "Shanghai School" and "Shanghai Boy Scouts" aircraft, flew in formation, circling the clouds. The yellow dust of the Hongqiao Road was stirred again by the cars of the returning audience speeding in single file.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Proverbs About Money <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Qifenglouzhu</p>
<p>It's not that I start writing about money for no reason, but in this snobbish modern society, everything depends on money. Since the ancient barter era, advancing to currency exchange, money has become the beginning of everything. No one can live without it for a day. If you have money, people will flock to you and welcome you, and your status will rise even if it's not high! If you don't have money, even if you are a 正直[righteous] gentleman, people will despise you! There is a world of difference between having money and not having money. A poet once wrote a poem about money, "With money, you can make ghosts turn the mill; without it, even brothers won't come." I have collected proverbs about money for your amusement.</p>
<p>Wealth should not be flaunted. Wealthy people are often weak. People die for wealth. You want money, not life. Wealth moves people's hearts. Look at the face of the copper coin. Wealth follows the wealthy. An ounce of gold is worth four ounces of fortune. People rely on copper coins, fish rely on water. Officials travel thousands of miles only for money. Having a thousand coins, you want ten thousand. Remember penniless days when you have money. Ill-gotten gains do not enrich the poor. As long as there are enough copper coins, you can carry a pagoda across the river. A hundred is wrong, a thousand is reasonable, ten thousand is foolproof. When poor, no one asks in the streets; when rich, even distant relatives visit in the deep mountains.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p>
<p>Generously baring his heart, forgetting family and serving the country</p>
<p>Sadly facing the jade mirror, lamenting my longing for her</p>
<p>Baofang continued: The company commander and I studied the terrain in this vicinity and came to observe it in person. We know that this small fort is of great importance. It is best to send a regiment to garrison here first, which should be increased to a brigade. But at present, due to the problem of barracks and supplies, we can only transfer a battalion here first. The division commander approved my plan, so we were transferred here on that day of strong wind and sand. Fourth, let me ask, are you a real man? I, Shi Baofang, dare to say that since I was eight years old, I have never been a fool! As he spoke, he clenched his right hand tightly and punched his palm several times. He also said: You also say to me that our Northeast Army is a non-resistance army, what's the use of gritting your teeth in anger? You, the production Northeast Army, the Northeast has been lost. You have no way to change this fact. Yes, the Northeast has been lost. Of the 300,000 soldiers, aren't all of them non-resistance? This matter is all at once. As he said this, his face tightened and turned red. Hearing these words, recalling what he had heard before and after for a year, his face also turned red. Baofang continued: Soldiers need to cherish their lives. Can we endure this humiliation? We have not previously washed away our reputation as a non-resistance army. Now our opportunity has come. The North Army is fighting for a breath, and at the same time, it must also earn a person's saying for the Chinese people that China is not without people, but you have not encountered them. Now, does he ultimately want the Chinese to be no people? It is here that we cannot say that we can all be fragrant, I can! What about you?" (341)</p>
<h3 id="e149">On a Night of Continuous Spring Rain <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Jizhi</p>
<p>After drinking in the evening, I felt a little tired. I took a cigarette and lay horizontally on the oar to smoke. The smoke curled upwards and was blown out of the window by a slight breeze. It was probably still raining lightly. The water in the lead pipe was playing a long and clear tune. Outside the window was dark and沉沉 [gloomy]. On such a night of continuous spring rain, instead of saying it was宁静 [peaceful], it was better to say it was desolate, especially for me, with the mood of a romantic writer who had contracted "世纪病" (Malady of the Century), I felt endless emptiness and抑[depression]!</p>
<p>It was almost burning to my fingers, so I threw it on the ground. My body was still lazily unwilling to move. I was thinking: I felt that I should not have this decadent tendency, but should be active in the direction of interesting and meaningful life; although my so-called interesting and meaningful outlook on life seemed to have a color of personal hedonism.</p>
<p>On the surrounding mahogany bookshelves, there were gold-stamped, thread-bound, literary, and academic books. When I felt like reading, I would take out one or two and lie on the elastic sofa to browse, while smoking the cigarette I liked to smoke; before the rain, Sparrow's Tongue, I would always choose good tea to brew. Isn't this very carefree?</p>
<p>Outside the wall, under the weeping willows, was a clear and translucent shallow stream. When I was in a quiet mood, I would shake a painted boat to browse the miscellaneous trees and wildflowers standing along the shore; or I would let the boat flow with the water, and I would imitate that long-haired poet, squatting in the middle of the boat to pour wine and sing loudly. It seemed to be very meaningful, right?</p>
<p>If those sincere and unpretentious farmers were willing to chat with me, I could箕踞 [sit with legs spread out] on the green and oily field ridges to listen to them tell those缥渺 [vague] stories above Yi Huang; or I could sit alone under the peach forest and watch the gorgeous falling flowers flowing with the silent stream to that far and never-to-be-seen place; If not, I can also take my own Austin to the繁华𤍠闹 [bustling] city to live for three or five days, to change the air that is about to be bored, which is also a very self-enjoyable and rich-in-life meaning life!</p>
<p>However, the facts proved to me that this was completely an unattainable utopia. Wake up!</p>
<p>The water in the lead pipe was still flowing. The rain, at this time, thought it had not stopped.</p>

<p>㈢ The Carnival Festival in Nice</p>
<p>Nice is not only a famous scenic spot with pleasant weather for summering and wintering, but also a human paradise full of romance and joy. Every traveler who has participated in the Nice Carnival Festival cannot help but tirelessly praise the carnival fun enjoyed during the festival period upon returning.</p>
<p>Every year from July to September, while other places are experiencing the hot summer, Nice is always warm and bright like spring. Men and women with ample travel funds slip out from major European cities and come to Nice on the "Côte d'Azur" to spend a happy summer. The blue sea, the blue sky, the blue vehicles, the blue eyes, and the blue gemstone rings hold a grand exhibition on the golden beach.</p>
<p>In Nice, summer is always sunny and warm, without a single drop of rain. Travelers can leisurely enjoy the scenery and sunbathing. At dusk, a gentle breeze brings a feeling of tenderness everywhere. One can quietly sit alone on the Mediterranean coast and meditate, or climb the Alps with a lover, or browse novels under the shade of pine, cypress, and olive trees, or cheer and sing in a crowd of happy young men and women, what a free and unrestrained life!</p>
<p>In Nice, there are many festivals every year, which are days of joyful dancing and singing. In the summer of 1933, there were a total of three months of festival celebrations.

<p>▲Edited by Ruan Weicun▲Checked by Shen Siliang</p>
<p>The 10th Far Eastern Games will be held in the Philippines on May 12th. There are only a little over a month left until the meeting. Both Japan and the Philippines are actively preparing. It has been twenty years since the Far Eastern Games began, and our country has sent people to participate in every event and hosted the second, fifth, and eighth games. However, few people pay attention to the history and achievements of past games, and there are no special books to record them. Recently, the "History and Achievements of the Far Eastern Games" published by Qinfen Bookstore at 392 Labor Father Road, French Concession, Shanghai (across from the National Sports Advancement Association) was edited by Ruan Weicun and proofread by Shen Siliang, the main member of the China National Sports Advancement Association. The various records and photos in the book took ten years to collect. It details the proceedings of past games and the official records of track and field, all-around, swimming, football, basketball, volleyball, tennis, baseball, cycling, women's tennis, and women's volleyball. It also includes detailed information on the list of athletes in past games, the schedule and venues of past games, the presidents of past games, and the championship results of past games. The most valuable thing in the book is the hundreds of photos, such as photos of the founder of the games, photos of the trophies donated by Yuan Shikai and Li Yuanhong, photos of the winning teams in each event from the first to the ninth games, and photos of individual winners, which are dazzling and spectacular. The entire book is a thick volume and sells for only 9 jiao and 5 fen, plus 1 jiao and 1 fen for registered postage for out-of-town mail orders. The store's storefront is located at 554 Fourth Malu, British Concession, Shanghai.</p>

<p>▲Ten Measures Defined... Patrol Routes Focus on Rural Areas</p>
<p>—No Admission Fee—</p>
<p>Film performances are the most realistic and touching. Educational films are promoted by European and American countries, especially with great effort. If this type of film can be popularized throughout the country and penetrate into rural areas, its effectiveness will be great. The capital and Shanghai in our country have achieved great results in implementing educational films, and all provinces are planning to promote them. Zhejiang Province also needs it urgently. It is said that the Education Department, in view of this, plans to first organize a film patrol team to tour various counties to screen educational films, starting in May this year. The required start-up costs will be transferred from the provincial education funds for this year. The "Measures for Screening Educational Films by the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department Film Patrol Team" and the "Budget for Start-up Costs and Recurring Expenses" were drafted and submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for deliberation. 　　、　　　Screening measures, ㈠ In order to enlighten the people, revitalize rural areas, assist school education, and promote social education, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education organizes a film patrol team to screen educational films. ㈡ The film patrol team consists of one officer, one mechanic, and accompanying film machinery and all equipment to tour the counties for screening. ㈢ When the film patrol team arrives in each county, the county government should, in accordance with the following principles, jointly plan the patrol route, screening venues, and screening times, etc.: 1. The patrol route focuses on rural areas; 2. The screening venues borrow public places such as schools, temples, and ancestral halls; 3. The screening time can be day or night; 4. A maximum of four screenings per day; 5. The tour date for each county is based on one or two weeks; ㈣ After the route, venue, and time are determined, the county government shall notify the autonomous organizations, public security organizations, and educational organizations in the areas passed through to assist in the implementation and fill out a preliminary tour screening report to be submitted to the Education Department for verification; ㈤ All expenses required by the film patrol team shall be paid by the Provincial Education Department under the expense item and shall not be supplied by the local government. However, officers and mechanics may borrow educational institutions or public venues to live in; ㈥ Screening educational films will absolutely not collect admission fees from the audience. However, the number of visitors may be moderately limited to avoid crowding; ㈦ During the screening, the officer should explain the situation in the film in detail to ensure that the audience fully understands; ㈧ In addition to screening educational films, the film patrol team should also prepare auxiliary tools for lectures and conduct popular lectures before and after the screening; ㈨ After the tour and screening in each county is completed, the officer should fill out a tour screening work report and submit it to the Education Department for verification; ㈩ These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Handover of Film Examination Committee <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Film Examination Committee jointly formed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education is now being changed to be affiliated to the Party Department instead of the administrative organ. The Central Film Enterprise Guidance Committee of the Central Propaganda Committee has hired Luo Gang, Dai Ce, and other seven people to be responsible for examining films. (The association is still named the Film Examination Committee and is affiliated with the Film Enterprise Guidance Committee.) The reorganized meeting has been established. The Central Film Enterprise Guidance Committee dispatched Luo Gang, the director of the examination committee, to the Film Examination Committee jointly formed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education to receive the examination committee from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM yesterday (20th). During the receiving procedures, the responsible committee members of the association jointly formed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education (Li Jingbi, the internal editor, and Li Jiaxiang, the commissioner of the Ministry of Education) returned the film equipment and documents to the association. Yang Junli, the second section chief of the Police Department of the Ministry of Interior, and Zhang Jiong, the director of the Social Department of the Ministry of Education, counted them before handing them over to Luo Gang, the director of the reorganization. It is said that the reorganized examination committee's office will be located in Er Tiao Xiang, and it is currently temporarily borrowing the original place in the Education Department auditorium to examine films for a period of three weeks. After the office in Er Tiao Xiang is deployed, it will be moved in. The receiving on the 20th was for machines and documents. The old association jointly formed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education will handle the accounting for two months in order to report to the Audit Department. As for the old association's organization, in addition to the seven committee members sent by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, who each receive their original salary in the department and receive a transportation allowance of 30 yuan in the association, there are also four staff members (monthly salary of 180 yuan, 160 yuan, 120 yuan, and 100 yuan respectively), and nine clerks (the chief clerk receives 80 yuan, and the rest receive 40 to 50 yuan). The monthly expenditure was about 1,000 yuan. The new association's director receives 200 yuan, and the remaining six people receive 100 to 100 yuan respectively. Moreover, according to the regulations, 4 to 6 staff members and a number of clerks can be set up, and the expenses are all paid by the association. The scope is slightly larger than the old association, and the Central Propaganda Committee will request the central government to subsidize the original expenses. It is also said that more than a dozen staff members and clerks of the old association will be reorganized by the new association.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Municipal Education Bureau Issues Orders to Promulgate Revised Measures for Dental Clinics <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>▲ And the Schedule of Clinic Dates for Each School</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau instructed all municipal primary and secondary schools, stating that according to the official letter from the Municipal Health Bureau, "Upon investigation, the number of students with dental defects in the city's schools is nearly 50% or more. Therefore, efforts must be made to improve the correction aspect. Since the establishment of the dental clinic, many schools have sent students to the clinic for treatment, but there are also many who have been slow to send them, which is not conducive to preserving children's health. Therefore, starting from this semester, new treatment measures will be implemented to improve this situation." The bureau jointly issued the treatment measures and the first set of dental clinic schedules for each school, instructing the schools to comply. The measures and schedule are transcribed as follows: (甲) Measures: ㈠ The bureau has established a complete dental clinic in the Xilin Road Health Office in the South Shanghai District, with treatment hours from 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM daily. The clinic is closed on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. ㈡ Due to limited funding, the bureau has temporarily hired one dentist and one dental assistant. To ensure detailed work, the number of people is limited to a maximum of six in the morning and no more than seven in the afternoon. ㈢ For the convenience of work, the bureau has adopted a rotating treatment system, with five schools as a group, and the time ranges from four months to ten months (treatment for new students in the second semester of the 22nd year is temporarily postponed). When the treatment of each group of five schools is completed, then the other five schools will begin. ㈣ Students with dental diseases who can independently seek treatment from other licensed dentists are free to do so. However, they must submit a certificate of recovery from the dentist to the school, and the school will then submit it to the Education Bureau for cancellation of the student's defect record. ㈤ Students with acute dental diseases, even if they are not listed in the five schools, can bring their treatment records and films to the clinic during office hours for treatment. ㈥ In addition to the five designated schools, to facilitate other schools, it is specifically stipulated that Friday afternoons and Saturday mornings are the dates for treating the dental diseases of students and teachers from other schools. However, prior consultation and scheduling with the bureau's dentists is required. If arrangements have not been made, no treatment will be provided except for emergency cases. The daily number of dental treatments will be determined by the doctor based on the preparation of the condition. ㈦ All</p>
<p>schools that have been examined by the bureau's health personnel have their students' dental conditions recorded in the "Defect Correction Record." This record is kept by the school, and the schools should check it frequently. From now on, schools should send six to seven students with dental diseases on time according to the scheduled dates. Those who need follow-up visits will be notified by the bureau's dental clinic at any time according to the schedule. ㈧ For each group of five designated schools, there are two schools that are farther away from the dental clinic. The Health Bureau will send a car to pick them up and drop them off, still limited to six to seven people each time. The schools should pre-arrange the students who need treatment to save time. ㈨ The equipment of dental instruments and the hiring of medical personnel consume a significant amount of municipal funds. The original purpose was to specialize in correcting students' dental diseases. If the school authorities are not attentive, it will not only waste funds but also greatly affect the health of students. From now on, if it is found that schools within the five designated schools fail to send students according to the scheduled dates, the principal of the school will be given a major demerit by the Education Bureau. After three major demerits, the principal will be dismissed. (乙) Clinic Schedule: Monday, morning: He'an; afternoon: Wuben. Tuesday, morning: Wanzhu; afternoon: Bide. Wednesday, morning: Meixi; afternoon: Wuben. Thursday, morning: He'an; afternoon: Bide. Friday, morning: Wanzhu; afternoon: other schools. Saturday, morning: Meixi and other schools.</p>

<p>▲ Terminology of Standard Weights and Measures and Sectioning of Arithmetic Naming</p>
<p>The Science Society of China in this city previously received a letter from the Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industry, seeking revisions to the draft of standard weights and measures and terminology. The Ministry of Education and the National Compilation and Translation Bureau also sought opinions on the sectioning of arithmetic naming. Recently, they also inquired about the society's opinion on the entire draft of mathematical terms. However, the society believed that these cases required the opinions of experts and a majority of people before they could be answered. Therefore, the 112th meeting of the board of directors decided that the sectioning of arithmetic naming would be discussed by the general secretary convening members of the society's astronomy and mathematics departments. The draft of mathematical terms would be reviewed by the original drafters and Mr. Gu Yangwu.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Publication of the Innovative Foreign Language Learning Method <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>▲ A Guide for Middle School Students Learning Foreign Languages</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education announced the statistics of the graduation examination results of primary and secondary schools in various provinces and cities. Mathematics was the worst subject in both senior and junior high schools, followed by foreign languages. It was considered that special attention should be paid to urging and improving teaching methods. In fact, the time and effort spent by middle school students in studying foreign languages ​​is far more than learning other subjects, but the results of the graduation examination are still a failure. It is not that the students are unwilling to work hard, but that they have not obtained the proper learning methods. What is the loss of each middle school student after three or six years of hard work and the results are so poor? Lu Dianyuan, professor of English Teaching Methods in the Foreign Language Department of National Zhejiang University, has seen that students work hard but do not achieve results in learning foreign languages. In his spare time from teaching, he compiled and translated the book "Innovative Foreign Language Learning Method" based on scientific principles and teaching experience, introducing practical and feasible methods. If implemented according to this, it will achieve twice the result with half the effort. The book was recently published by World Book Company and the price is very low, only 25 cents per copy, in order to popularize it. At a time when various provinces and cities are holding graduation examinations and middle school students are panicking and forgetting to eat and sleep to prepare for foreign languages, which students generally recognize as difficult to learn, the publication of this book can serve as a compass for learning English and a guide for most young people. Time and effort can be used efficiently. It is advisable for middle school students to have a copy for themselves, and other self-learners of English can also purchase it for reference. President Guo of Zhejiang University wrote in the preface to his book: "If students across the country can choose the fastest way to complete their tools, so that they can browse a wide range of books and have unimpeded access, and then explore the mysteries of world academia, then Mr. Lu's book is not in vain." This is not a false statement.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Financial Market Gold Price Drops Two Yuan The U.S. House Passes the Dies Silver Bill <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>▼The Content of the Silver Bill Is Peaceful, Market Conditions Are Still Stable▲</p>
<p>The gold market fell yesterday due to the passage of the Dies Silver Bill in the U.S. House, effectively halting its upward momentum. However, the content of the Dies Silver Bill was moderate, resulting in relatively stable market conditions throughout the day. There was considerable buying interest when prices dipped. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both Britain and the U.S. fell in unison. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange dropped by six to eight and a half tenths of a cent. Exchange rates, on the other hand, rose. The price of raw gold in London remained unchanged. American cotton fell fifteen pounds, and American wheat fell twenty-five. The wool market opened strongly, rising to sixty-five yuan at one point. It then suddenly declined to fifty-six yuan due to a radio broadcast mentioning the passage of the American Dies Silver Bill. However, as official telegraphic news had not yet been released, buyers took advantage of the low prices, causing a rebound. Nevertheless, Reuters reported that the U.S. House had passed the Poage Bill and that the Dies Silver Bill had also passed with 257 votes against 112, making it difficult for the market to remain firm and creating a sense of fatigue. After the opening, the exchange rate market tended to ease, and news from the Associated Press and other agencies indicated that the Dies Silver Bill stipulated that foreign countries using silver to purchase American agricultural products should be charged 25% above the world market price, leading to a further decline. However, Reuters also reported that U.S. House Speaker Rayburn announced the Frear Silver Bill, which proposed that the government purchase 1.5 billion ounces of silver until prices returned to the 1926 level, and that discussions were suspended at the President's request, resulting in some recovery. Despite this, the exchange rate market hardened, and individual investors aggressively sold, pushing prices down. Reuters' U.S. market report stated that the silver bill's passage after the market closed led to expectations of a fifty-pound increase in the opening price the following morning, as well as increased capital for rural lending banks to relieve rural areas. Prices fell again at noon but remained stable at the close. The overall market outlook was stable, and sentiment tended towards peace. There was a lot of short covering, and prices remained high. Although there were rumors of rising silver prices in the overnight market, they had little impact. The day's market conditions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning price was 956.8 yuan, down 2.1 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 6.5 yuan. The exchange rate market opened with recent investment prices of British exchange at 1 shilling 4 and 25/100 pence, and U.S. exchange at 34.5625 yuan. Bingxing, Hengyu, Dadecheng, and others sold immediately upon entering the market, retreating from 7 yuan to 4.4 yuan. Datong offered American dollars for April at 6.875. Honglisheng advanced to 5.6 yuan. The domestic market remained strong. Mitsui offered American dollars for June at 0.0625, and for July at 0.1875. Hengyu and Zhengchang even sold at 3.7 yuan. Anticipating that HSBC's listed price would remain unchanged, Yuanmao, Yuanmao, Yongyi, Feng, Yongheng, Yusheng, Dada, and Dadecheng all bought in, driving the price up to 6 yuan. Huabi offered American dollars for June at 35 yuan, and Mitsui offered for July at 0.1875. Yuqing and Yingtianfeng supplied at high prices, returning to within 5 yuan. Yuanmao and Yongjin reappeared, and Fuchang, Richang, Yida, Yong, and others also [sold], further reducing the price to 3.5 yuan. Hengyu, Yi, Yuqing, Yongheng, Xing, and others successively bought.

<p>The afternoon market opened at 955.2 yuan, with goods opening at 5 yuan. Zhengjin offered American dollars for June at 0.0625, retreating from 5.3 yuan to 4.6 yuan. It was rumored that the overnight silver price had risen by more than twenty pounds, but this had little impact. Mitsui bought American dollars for July at 0.1875. Bingxing, Yida, Yongheng, and Xing bought in, driving the price up to 6.8 yuan. Zhifeng, Yong, Zhengchang, and Fuchang tried to sell, reducing the price to 5.5 yuan. After entering, the bank bought American dollars for July at 0.125. Dadecheng and Hengxing advanced again to 6.4 yuan. Qianchangxiang sold, retreating again to 5.8 yuan. However, the domestic market was extremely stable, and sentiment stabilized. Hengxing occasionally made slight additions, resulting in much maneuvering, hovering around 6 yuan. The closing price was 956 yuan, and goods were auctioned at 6.5 yuan. Thus, the market was more stable after the close. Hengtai, Qingfa, Yongxing, Bingxing, and others all advanced. Although Yida Yong sold, the price still rose to around 6 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 957 yuan, and the lowest price was 953.3 yuan, a fluctuation of 3.7 yuan. As a result, it closed down 2.9 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on HSBC's U.S. dollar listing price remaining unchanged at 34.25 yuan, resulting in a gold price of 1010 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was suppressed by about 54 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan compared to the previous close. This month's closing price was based on HSBC's shilling listing price remaining flat at 1 shilling 4 and 125/1000 pence. With the British and American exchange rate at 4.98605 as the standard, the gold price was converted to 716.42 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was suppressed by about 4 yuan, an increase of more than 3 yuan compared to the previous close. The registered price for this month was 713 yuan, for April 956 yuan, and for May 955 yuan. The morning supplementary water price was 713 yuan, and the red gold price was calculated at 970 yuan. There was a lack of trading in the market, and foreign merchants were silent. Only Yingfeng Heng sold more than a hundred taels to the silver shop merchants, adding 15 yuan. The swap market was sluggish, with mismatched long and short positions, resulting in no transactions throughout the day. Therefore, as of today, the April term chips still amounted to 2,919.</p>
<p>Trading in the market remained active. In summary, Hengxing, Yuqing, Yonghengchang, Yongchang, Shengyong, Bingxing, Tongchun, Xianghe, Duanxing, Fuyu, Huixiang, Hengtai, and others were mainly sellers. Shengsheng, Dada, Fayong, Yuanheng, Yida Yong, Yongfeng, Dachangxiang, Yiyu, Yifeng, and Yongwanxing were mainly buyers.

<p>The March term opened in the morning at 715 yuan, down 1 yuan from the previous close. This price was sold by Shunli to Hengyu for 35. After entering, Hengxing and Yida Yong had a good appetite and pushed the price down. The shilling listing price remained unchanged, and the listed price was still 716 yuan, so the situation still fell. Dadecheng sold 21 to Zhifeng Yong, retreating to 2.5 yuan. Then Xie Kang sold 49 to Yuanmao Yong at the same price. At noon, Hongxing sold 63 to Shunli, and Fuyu sold 42 to Shunli, further reducing the price to 2 yuan, but there was no listing price.

After the opening, banks tended to fill orders and then loosen. HSBC's listing price was announced, with both British and American currencies flat. There was still some struggle, but sentiment was extremely weak, and banks' appetite was not strong. The market remained hard at noon, and the afternoon market was extremely flat. Banks balanced [accounts] and settled [trades], and the process showed a slight tightness. Forced closing selling prices were recent, with British exchange at 1 shilling 4 and 3125/10000 pence and U.S. exchange at 34.6875 yuan, an increase of 0.0625 for the British pound and 0.1875 for the U.S. dollar compared to the previous close.

<h3 id="e179">Increased Complexity of Bank Clearing <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The market situation of the silver and money industry can be traced back to mid-January at the beginning of the year. Due to the slack season for various industries, there was an urgent need for clearing, so the market atmosphere was exceptionally desolate, with no possibility of activity. Up until the past few days, the market remained sluggish due to the poor commercial situation and cautious lending by money houses, resulting in a lack of activity. The market, which had been trying to become active, turned silent again. Starting from the day before yesterday, the market saw a slight increase in activity due to large movements of goods by foreign merchants, which led to a slightly more active flow of funds. As a result, the market became more vibrant, and clearing became more complex. The atmosphere in the market was also invigorated. However, the interbank lending rate remained unchanged due to an appropriate balance of supply and demand, with the morning and noon rates remaining at two cents. Overdrafts were also at two to three cents, and transactions in interbank bills increased. Morning turnover was over 4.7 million, with new transactions exceeding 200,000. Noon turnover was over 800,000, and transactions among small associations were over 400,000. Inflows from customer routes amounted to 100,000, and outflows amounted to 400,000. Foreign mortgage transactions amounted to 1.67 million, and banknote collection and issuance amounted to over 3.1 million. Bank clearing included foreign banks clearing over 2.67 million in various bills, over 5 million in various goods, exchange, mortgage, electricity, and miscellaneous items, and over 800,000 in foreign exchange and debt prices. Warehousing amounted to 400,000. Chinese banks cleared 3.23 million in bills, 6.45 million in various goods, exchange, tax, mortgage, and miscellaneous items, and 300,000 in warehousing. Japanese banks cleared over 2.6 million in bills, over 4.22 million in various miscellaneous items, and 600,000 in warehousing. Money houses cleared over 41.1 million in foreign public bills, over 8.2 million in foreign overdrafts, and over 800,000 in various exchange bills. Clearing involved cash reconciliation, and there were slight inflows and outflows of large bars of silver. The total number of exchanges at the local clearing house was 7,551,065.01 yuan in silver, including 3,413,998.32 yuan in silver dollars and 4,137,066.69 yuan in exchange silver dollars.</p>

<p>│Copper Coins Shrink by 2,000 Cash│</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver coins seemed to rise again in the morning market by 2 yuan to 830 yuan, but in the afternoon market, they fell back to 828 yuan, resulting in the same outcome as the previous afternoon. The transaction volume was 11,000 jiao in the morning market and 6,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were 756.9 yuan in the morning market and 755 yuan in the afternoon market, resulting in a decrease of 3 yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon market.

Copper coins shrank by 2,000 cash to 319,000 cash, with a transaction volume of 31,900 strings, equivalent to 10,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Securities High Point Triggers the Emergence of Bulls The Rising Trend of Government Bonds Seems to Have Slowed Slightly <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Process Remains Extremely Stable, Resulting in More Gains Than Losses</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw high morale, which remained unabated. However, with the rising trend lasting for too long, it triggered the emergence of bulls. There was a slight reversal at one point yesterday, but it failed to push back against the market's firm morale. The shorts also did not dare to hesitate, resulting in a missed opportunity. Therefore, as soon as there was a slight easing, someone seized the opportunity to cover, making it difficult for prices to fall in the days leading up to settlement. When the market opened yesterday morning, No. 53, with its rapid advance and planned reduction this month, was lifted by half a yuan, making the shorts feel increasingly fearful and eager to cover. Numbers 16 and 17 were also bought in, and individual investors were also shorting swaps, creating a squeeze on shorts and intensifying the situation. This led to new high price records for various bonds from 1918 onward, except for the Consolidated Tax bonds, which weakened due to aggressive selling by numbers 11 and 59. The rising trend seemed to have slowed slightly. In the second session, there was a floating surplus, and prices uniformly retreated slightly, with the demobilization bonds falling by 0.5 yuan, the largest decline. A rapid advance and retreat were inevitable, but the [bonds] after the [Consolidated] Tax were relatively firm. When the market opened in the afternoon, there was short covering, and [prices] uniformly moved up by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The brief and shallow reversal showed that the strength of the bulls should not be underestimated. The closing was still in a cumulative rising trend, with another 0.1 to 0.2 yuan increase. The situation remained stable. The resulting market price fluctuations were slightly different, but there were still more gains than losses. The total transaction volume was 15,149,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot and 15,145,000 yuan in futures. The resulting highs, lows, gains, and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal's market report on the 19th stated that stocks, bonds, and commodities all fell due to labor disputes in the automotive and railway industries. Mining stocks collapsed due to the possibility that silver legislation would be delayed until the government investigated the situation in China. Market conditions on the small exchange were also weak, with special stocks being sold off continuously. German bonds fell sharply for unknown reasons, affecting the bond market. In addition, a report from the bank's New York agent stated that (securities) fell due to labor disputes and the delay in the silver bill's vote. (Wheat) fell due to the weakness of the stock market and the slight unloading by bulls. Spot prices were gradually tightening, indicating a decrease in supply. Do not sell short. (Cotton) fell sharply in the early morning. The passage of the Poage Bill led to the recovery of half the losses. There were few followers during the rise. The market was shaken by labor disputes and the growing opposition to the Recovery Bureau's proposals to reduce working hours and increase wages. Before the situation is determined, there will continue to be selling at high prices. The spot market is quiet. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e183">Rumors of Large Amounts of Spot Yarn Delivery Selling Sentiment Spreads in the Cotton Yarn Market <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>│Golden Rooster Yarn Enters the 80 Yuan Level Consistently│</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the falling trend is intensifying. As the delivery deadline approaches, there are rumors in the market that a large amount of spot yarn will be delivered. It is also said that foreign merchants have a significant short position and are preparing to ship Tianjin Chinese yarn to Shanghai for delivery. At the same time, actual demand remains sluggish. Under these circumstances, sellers are reactivating, selling sentiment is rising, and the market is falling. However, the cotton market is rising again, making it more difficult for factories. However, the outlet for spot yarn is too narrow, and the pressure is relatively heavy.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Price Drops Sharply by Approximately Two Yuan The morning market opening price of cotton yarn was affected by the weak American cotton market. The buying interest in the market was lacking, and prices for each month fell by 0.09 to 0.12 yuan. There were many rumors in the afternoon, with many saying that a certain factory had another large batch of hedging sales, and the situation became more volatile. Prices for each month fell by 0.07, 0.08, 0.1 to 0.126 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 42,000 bales. The statistics of sales showed that Changfeng sold 5,350 bales, Tongfu 1,050 bales, Mingde 900 bales, Yuande 950 bales, Dachang 1,250 bales, Tongxing 1,450 bales, and Xincheng 1,450 bales. The purchases showed that Dachangcheng bought 1,700 bales, Renfeng 900 bales, Taixing 1,000 bales, Jinchang 950 bales, Yuda 900 bales, Yuanyi 1,500 bales, Taichang 1,300 bales, Tonghe 1,150 bales, Yichang 900 bales, and Xiesheng 850 bales. The daily high and low prices and closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market is showing weakness again due to the fall of American cotton. Although the Poage-Hildebrandt relief bill has passed, the New York market price softened again at the close. As a result, people's sentiment is weak. However, the delivery chips for this month are not yet sufficient, which is inversely proportional to the yarn market. Therefore, the market is more expensive. Japanese merchants are also covering their short positions. However, spot cotton trading is not active. The American cotton outlook is bearish, and the sellers' attitude is very stable.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Slightly Declines The morning market opening price of raw cotton was affected by the falling American cotton market. The buying interest in the market was lacking, and prices for each month fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The market situation remained weak in the afternoon, and prices for each month fell again by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 58,300 dan. The statistics of sales showed that Xiji sold 3,700 dan, Yuanda 2,400 dan, Mingde 2,400 dan, Gengfeng 2,900 dan, Minghua 2,100 dan, Changfeng 5,300 dan, and Changhe 1,500 dan. The purchases showed that Tongfu bought 1,000 dan, Suisheng 1,800 dan, Renfeng 2,600 dan, Yichang 1,100 dan, Tonghe 2,400 dan, Yifeng 2,900 dan, Yuanda 1,900 dan, Taixing 2,000 dan, and Xincheng 1,600 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market declined due to profit-taking by long positions and weakness in Wall Street. Later, some short covering provided support, resulting in a spot price decrease of 15 points and a futures price decrease of 13 to 17 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 1 point, and futures prices fell by 9 to 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 2 points. The Bombay cotton market was quiet due to a small number of swaps. As a result, Pingar Bai Luo Xi both fell by half a rupee, and Omra fell by two and a half annas. Original telegram</p>

<h3 id="e187">Main Reasons for the Buoyant Flour Market <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>—Speculators Driving up Prices… Small Factories Cashing Out Forward Contracts—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning with a slightly soft but stable trend across all months. Quotations for imported wheat from Chicago and Canada were down slightly by about one to two jiao compared to the previous day. Therefore, after opening, the market sentiment remained calm, slightly recovering by about half a cent compared to the previous day. Later, because large mills still did not release stocks, some were even buying, and speculative long positions in the market continued to absorb supplies, stabilizing sentiment and gradually driving up prices. By the afternoon opening, market speculators were still pushing up prices, and mills were also withdrawing near-term offers, leading to a buoyant market sentiment. Small factories were also withdrawing near-term offers, but selling quite a few forward contracts. Northern merchants were both buying and selling, but selling exceeded buying. Under the current circumstances, the market is entirely driven by sentiment. In reality, sales to customers are not particularly strong. As a result, the current month was up by 1.75 cents compared to the previous day, April was up by 1.25 cents, May and June were up by 1 cent, July was up by 1.5 cents, and August was up by 1.75 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Wheat Futures Strengthen Following the Flour Market <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a positive trend in all months during both the morning and afternoon sessions. Although quotations for imported wheat were down slightly by about one to two jiao, the buoyant flour market inevitably changed market sentiment. The current month, with deliveries approaching, opened higher by two to three cents. Although trading in distant months was not particularly active, it also saw some upward movement. This is because the current short positions are not easily liquidated, and any buying by long positions can easily cause volatility. The closing results showed that June and July were up by 1 cent compared to the previous day, and August was up by 5 cents. The spot wheat market remains active, with limited arrivals and mills still eager to buy. An opening price of 3.48 yuan was quoted for Bengbu wheat, and 3.68 yuan for Shandong wheat, totaling 1,500 bags, handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Soybean Prices Rise by Three to Five Cents <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybean prices rose due to increased bids for standard grades, and market sentiment was optimistic. However, despite the tense market atmosphere, buyers seemed hesitant, suggesting a possible pattern of short-term gains followed by long-term weakness. Yesterday, top-grade Zhongguan soybeans rose by three to five cents, while lower grades remained unchanged. Transactions included one cart of Feihe soybeans and one cart of Mengcheng soybeans, purchased by local brokers. Additionally, 200 bags of Guide soybeans were for export, while 400 bags of Dangshan soybeans and one cart of Haozhou soybeans were purchased by mills.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the soybean oil market, except for Niuzhuang oil, which maintained its original price, factory oil, Dalian oil, and Qishan oil all increased by two to three jiao. It was reported that due to a telegram from Dalian reporting price increases, market sentiment slightly stabilized. Peanut oil supplies decreased, while sales in Zhejiang remained strong, leading to a rise of two to three jiao. Ground oil prices were quite firm. Transactions included 220 pieces of Bo'er raw oil at a price of 9.50 yuan, 2,000 pieces of warehouse-stored raw oil at a price of 9.20 yuan, and 100 pieces of light-skinned raw oil at a price of 8.90 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e204">One Hope <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Che</p>
<p>I was once surprised to hear that the German soldier Remarque, after laying down his gun, picked up a pen and was able to write the world-shaking masterpiece "All Quiet on the Western Front." Later, after reading Glaeser's "Class of 1902," I suddenly realized that Remarque, when he went to the battlefield, probably, like the average German youth, had literary masterpieces in his knapsack. Moreover, I believe that German education, from elementary school to middle school, pays absolutely more attention to the aspects of rhetoric than China does with its perfunctory attitude, so it is very common to produce one or two Remarques.</p>
<p>In China, there are undoubtedly many, many young people who have experienced various kinds of lives, but who have never produced a great work. The most obvious reason is, of course, that they have not received a good education. And even if they have received a good education, when they go to serve as soldiers, work as laborers, or struggle through life, they certainly do not have any literary masterpieces in their pockets, because fundamentally there are no masterpieces to bring. Therefore, instead of blaming the writers who are working hard for "the lack of great creations now," it would be better to scold the predecessors who did not leave behind many great creations.</p>
<p>However, fortunately, Chinese creations are flourishing day by day with the help of foreign legacies. Speaking of this, we, the group of young people who do not quite understand foreign languages and are seeking foreign legacies to engage in practice, cannot but thank the translators of the past ten years. Therefore, at present, I do not so much hope for the emergence of great creations, but I very much hope that more foreign literary masterpieces will be translated.</p>
<p>We are infants lacking breast milk, and we often cry out in hunger and cold in the back alleys!</p>
<h3 id="e205">Zhenjiang Correspondence <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Lun</p>
<p>Zhenjiang is now the capital of Jiangsu Province. A provincial capital should have the characteristics of a provincial capital. Are those wide roads, those cars that shoot like arrows released from a bowstring, the characteristics of a provincial capital? No. The characteristic of a provincial capital should be thousands of civil servants wearing badges!! Those big and small officials carrying briefcases on their way to government offices.</p>
<p>The major government offices are concentrated in the Zhongshan Road area in the city. Although Zhongshan Road is sixteen meters wide, there are not many cars passing by; apart from the occasional commercial vehicle, there are only a few "official cars" belonging to the major government offices. Therefore, many dull-witted small citizens keep grumbling that the road was built with so much manpower and material resources, but in reality, only a very small number of special classes benefit! Moreover, the government has always been short of money. The compensation of ten yuan per room for houses that were "forcefully demolished" for the road construction is still "on the books" to this day.</p>
<p>Although Zhenjiang is south of the Yangtze River, the people's habits, customs, language, and way of life are all Jiangbei-ized. It is not uncommon to see women with bound feet here, just as in the north. It is well known that the people of Jiangbei have the virtue of "enduring hardship and hard work." Zhenjiang is only separated from Xinghua, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Rugao, and other counties by a river, so all the more arduous work, such as pulling rickshaws and porterage, is contracted by the Jiangbei gangs. Most of the locals go out to do business, and they can "endure hardship and hard work" just like the people of Jiangbei who sail out on a small boat to travel and find food. Along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, in places like Shanghai and Suzhou, Zhenjiang people have considerable influence in the business world. When they leave their hometowns, they usually only have a bedding roll and a net basket. When they return, they may bring back thousands upon thousands of silver dollars. This is because the people of Zhenjiang have a special talent for saving money, and they have to weigh a large amount of money three times before spending it. Therefore, there are many poor people among the locals, but there are also quite a few middle-class families. The standard of living is higher in the city than outside the city, partly because of the distance in transportation, and partly because there is a group of "non-locals" living in the city. The demand for materials (such as houses and food) exceeds the supply, resulting in higher prices.</p>
<p>The locals call female domestic servants "Gao Ma" uniformly; while "Xiaodajie" is called "Lianzi." These two terms are quite puzzling, and even the locals do not know where they come from. After the bankruptcy of the countryside, there were suddenly many more "Gao Ma" and "Lianzi." To hire a "Lianzi" only requires a salary of eight jiao to one yuan per month. The salary of a "Gao Ma" is at most two yuan per month. Although the wages are meager, at least they can eat their fill; this is much better than waiting to starve to death in the declining countryside. In Zhenjiang, it is really difficult to find a modern woman. Even if you sometimes come across a "westernized" woman in a leather coat and high heels, her accent is definitely not local, but belongs to the family members of those big and small officials. Even if a local woman is a daughter of a wealthy family, she often wears foot wrappings and cotton qipaos in winter; leather coats and high heels are extremely rare.</p>
<p>This city is not thoroughly new, and it is too vaguely old, probably similar to many provincial capitals in inland China.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Thoughts on the He Xu Creative Issue <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Wenzhou</p>
<p>Recently, another unfortunate thing has happened in the literary world, which is the matter of "He Jiahai and Xu Zhuanpeng's novels being unclear." On the one hand, there is an absolute denial from the start, and on the other hand, a list of goods with quantities is presented, and those who "speak out of righteousness" are even using the Spring and Autumn annals' technique of "concealing the faults of relatives." This kind of thing that is still unclear to this day may never be clear. In the future, I think it will either be a win-win situation or both sides will make sacrifices, allowing the presiding gentleman to gain a prestigious name. In general, it will not be a good gift to the literary world. The main reason why this matter is called unfortunate lies in this.</p>
<p>Because the matter is still unclear (although there is Mr. Shiheng's "last resort" "disclosure" and Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng's "helpless" "confession," but Mr. He Jiahai's "statement" and "defense" of "presenting evidence" have not yet been seen), outsiders naturally cannot make a judgment. Fortunately, the matter has not yet ended. Let's talk about it after it has been disclosed clearly in the future. However, "things have come to this point," and we cannot help but have a few thoughts:</p>
<p>First, a few years ago, we saw in the newspaper that a Mr. Shi had specialized in stealing manuscripts, and the victims were Mr. Yu Dafu and others. Later, we heard that a love novel expert who enjoyed great fame in the Yomiuri market was buying other people's manuscripts at low prices, signing his own name, and selling them at high prices. Recently, we have learned from many articles that some people specialize in hiring many low-priced secretaries to translate or write books for themselves in order to gain both fame and wealth. This has simply become a very popular and shameless trend (naturally, this trend can easily poison a new writer, and we must sweep it away). According to Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng's confession: "Because he (referring to He Jiahai) knew Xu Zhimo, his articles had a way out not long after he arrived in Shanghai. Sometimes he was in a hurry to pay fees, rent, and buy meal tickets, but he did not have any existing articles on hand to exchange for money, so he took my articles." From this, we can infer that such a thing is possible. For example, an article may not be published under Xu Zhuanpeng's name first, but after being taken back and published in another magazine, it becomes He Jiahai's name. Moreover, the editor who thinks he knows does not know, which is one of the reasons that constitute this possibility. In order to sweep away this shameless trend, I think it is necessary to clarify thoroughly, otherwise it will fall into the same trap as general theft cases. It is said that in Shanghai, detectives often condone those big thieves and principals who have already been greeted and entertained, and only catch a few small thieves as examples for the owners to see in order to win the reward of their superiors and the praise of society. However, I hope that discerning critics will not fall into the suspicion of acting as detectives!</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng said it very well: "Both Jiahai and I should admit the 'sins' and mistakes.' We have already done the wrong thing, and we only hope that similar things will not happen again in the future." Although, from an outsider's perspective, it is very easy for Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng to admit these "sins" and "mistakes" (because this can, on the contrary, make him gain both fame and wealth), we still cannot but respect this frank expression. However, we hope that Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng will give us a little more frank facts. Judging from Mr. Shiheng's article alone, it first makes people know that there are still some facts that "have not been permitted by Zhuanpeng and are now inconvenient to disclose" that are being concealed by Mr. Shiheng. Moreover, according to Mr. Shiheng's narrative, Mr. Zhuanpeng wanted to withdraw the article because of the encouragement of his friends, but he hesitated when the action was about to be carried out, as if he had some unspeakable difficulties. What's more, Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng himself has also said that "it is difficult for outsiders to understand Jiahai's difficulties and our difficulties." All of these make people unable to help but doubt the degree of frankness of Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng. Third, the unclear matters of Mr. He Jiahai and Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng should be clarified. Whether it is for the entire literary world or for their future, it should be clarified. However, this requires a fair mind from the general public and the magnanimity of good critics. Mr. Shiheng started by questioning and investigating, and then only told others, without pointing out or criticizing. Finally, he took responsibility for an undisclosed pseudonym and disclosed the facts he knew. After publicly announcing it in a newspaper with hundreds of thousands of daily sales, he still declared that he was forced to do so as a last resort and advised others not to publicize the matter, which is even more despised. This has already lost the magnanimity of a critic. At the same time, he and his friend Mr. Qingdaofu unanimously praised Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng's articles extremely, but only made some one-sided and premature judgments on the behavior that should be responsible for both parties. If we further link up everything that Mr. Shiheng has recently criticized about Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng, it is very difficult to make people see the fair heart of Mr. Shiheng. Not long ago, some small publications also attacked Mr. He Jiahai for having a certain tendency, and that tendency was precisely the target that Mr. Shiheng has always attacked. For the sake of the critic's fate, Mr. Shiheng should at least not make people think that his speaking out of righteousness has a meaning and effect that is more for friends than for the literary world. As for the "sins" and "mistakes" of Mr. He Jiahai, although we can only wait for Mr. He Jiahai himself to "admit" or "quibble" before speaking, it is okay to give a few words of advice first: Mr. He is still a very promising new writer. He should have the courage and determination to admit his "mistakes" and "sins," to openly publish all the facts frankly and honestly, to accept all criticisms and even scolding lessons from all sides, and to work hard in a very promising direction. Otherwise, he will not only be despised by others, but he will not even be able to save himself.</p>

<p>— Lu Yan</p>
<p>Ge Buxi kept throwing the books I didn't need into my suitcase. He put them in, I took them out, and after a while, he put them in my suitcase again. He seemed to think that these were the books I usually read and should take with me. But how could he know that I don't need them now; and how could I myself know that I will need them in the future?</p>
<p>Lan and my mother repeatedly told me to take care of my health, eat well, and sleep early. However, who can know that people who love health are prone to illness, while people who don't love health live long?</p>
<p>Everything is unknowable. But we all hope for a good future.</p>
<p>Therefore, I also hope that my journey will be safe and that I will encounter happy things.</p>
<p>II. In the Shanghai-Beiping Train</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the carriage, it was as if I had arrived in Beiping. Almost all the waiters on the train spoke fluent and harmonious Beiping dialect. It had been seven or eight years since I had heard such pure words. It made me feel happy and trustful. Although I was still in Shanghai, it was like arriving in the refreshing and honest northern country.</p>
<p>The train was about to leave, and I suddenly remembered that I had written the wrong date on the telegram just now. I couldn't come back if I got off myself, so I asked the waiter if there was a solution. "You write a note, and I'll ask him to take it. He's one of us, the cleaner, and he definitely won't make a mistake!"</p>
<p>I absolutely believed that he wouldn't make a mistake, even though he wouldn't see me again. If it were a southerner, I would have to be suspicious.</p>
<p>The train moved slowly, faster. The lights representing Shanghai that night gradually faded and became desolate. Soon we were speeding through the darkness.</p>
<p>Lao Ye kept reciting his poems to me frankly. He was truly a big child. He made me feel old. Ten years ago, I was about the same as him, saying whatever I wanted, but now I am always silent. I don't want others to know my history and life, thoughts and feelings. I have learned the techniques of life.</p>
<p>He said that his child couldn't hear the birds singing, and he was worried about the child. This is really a sad thing. My child is like this too. Many children are like this too. Parents often think that schools in the city are better than schools in the countryside. They love the city themselves, so they bring their children to the city. But they don't know that schools in the city have nothing but a few magnificent school buildings. Even if they are lucky enough to be really good, it is still sad without a natural environment to nurture the children. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Lin Weiyin</p>
<p>To prevent herself from having any more excuses so she could settle down and write the article she had planned, Yina stayed up almost until dawn yesterday before returning home. However, now, even though she had forced her mother and younger siblings back to their own rooms, and had arranged cigarettes, tea, paper, and pen on the table, she still could not calm her heart, and even could not bring herself to sit in the chair in front of the table.</p>
<p>"If I don't write now, what will become of me!" she warned herself.</p>
<p>But she was still pacing back and forth, refusing to let her body sit down, as if the chair cushion was a beehive, and she would be stung if she sat down.</p>
<p>"Why is it that on a Sunday evening, not a single person calls?" The longing that had been in her subconscious was no longer subconscious. —Yes, she was hoping that someone, anyone, would call her and ask her out, so she could find a rescue.</p>
<p>"How stupid to choose a Sunday to start working!" she began to blame herself. "If others don't call me, why don't I call them myself? Okay, I'll just stay up another night, and definitely start writing tomorrow."</p>
<p>So she decided to make a call, and as she walked towards the telephone, she had already decided on the person she wanted to call.</p>
<p>"Is this the Song residence?—Please let Miss Three answer the phone.—Is that Huiqun?—This is Yina.—I'm at home. Yes, I'm all alone.—I was just about to ask you out.—Tell me.—Dahua?—Oh, Dahu, okay.—First come, first served.—At the entrance inside."</p>
<p>Yina was the first to arrive at Dahu. After waiting for a while, she saw Xiao Songchen and Hou Ziji arriving.</p>
<p>"Oh, Miss Chen. Are you alone? Waiting for Ye Chu?" Ziji said first.</p>
<p>Yina shook her head.</p>
<p>"Then, has Ye Chu already arrived?" Songchen added.</p>
<p>"No; I don't know," Yina said. "I'm waiting for Huiqun."</p>
<p>"How about we go inside together and wait?" Songchen suggested to her.</p>
<p>"We agreed to wait here; or you can go in first if you like."</p>

<h3 id="e211">Prohibition of Banquets, Opium, Gambling, and the Dawn Movement <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>The galloping iron hooves of the Northeast Four Provinces and the bombing of Shanghai once awakened the Chinese government and public from their drunken dream of pleasure, shouting slogans of enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, and working diligently day and night to raise funds for the cause. For a time, it was carried out with great fanfare, like something important was happening. Unfortunately, this call failed to awaken the deaf and enlighten the blind, and could not reverse the decline. Following the departure of the Japanese cannon fire, it disappeared without a trace, even vanishing altogether. One only needs to open their eyes to see that movie theaters, dance halls, art venues, and large stages are more prosperous than ever before. Grand hotels and restaurants, singing platforms and dancing pavilions, are still filled with songs and dances, and orchestras everywhere. Where is there any sign of national crisis or foreign invasion? It is simply a scene of peace and prosperity from the Tang and Yu dynasties!</p>
<p>However, one is born in sorrow and dies in ease. Moreover, at this time of "imminent peril" and "multiple disasters," some officials who are "vigilant and diligent, finding it difficult to sleep or eat" have embraced the "grand aspiration" of changing customs and habits, "cleansing away old filth," "revitalizing the spirit," and "rectifying themselves to lead by example." Recently, it has been reported that in Kaifeng, Henan, various government agencies are vigorously implementing the "Dawn Movement." Military and political leaders conduct morning exercises for one hour every day, followed by specialized academic lectures. When the chairman inspects Mengjin, he also admonishes the county magistrate and civil servants. Han Qingtian of Shandong Province has repeatedly emphasized and advocated "vitality," and the Military Affairs Committee also reiterated the previous order on the second day of this month: (order omitted). Judging from this order, it has gathered the great achievements of Chinese society's bad habits, purely living an extremely decadent and depraved life. Some are inextricably linked with "opium" girls from India, spending their days intoxicated in a haze of smoke and mist, with a dim lamp, a single couch, and a situation where they are active at night and inactive during the day, resembling a skeleton three parts human and seven parts ghost. Some are addicted to gambling, either playing mahjong in rounds, or shouting and drinking while playing dice, making games of chance. The dog racing tracks, pelota courts, and large gambling dens in this big city are even more their destinations. And those who generally hunt for beauty and pursue those with "the disease of the lonely one" have long become "regulars" at the brothels. Many popular courtesans also regard bureaucratic politicians as "extremely welcome" guests. As for the small banquets every three days and the large banquets every five days, used by those who see them as a way to "connect feelings" in order to seek advancement, they are even more numerous. This morbid phenomenon, if left unchecked, has actually become an "accepted fact." It is a necessary condition for those "aspiring to politics." Lacking these skills creates a situation where one can "forget about mixing in officialdom."</p>
<p>These bad habits directly manifest as procrastination and wasted time, but under their influence, they lead to political corruption, the exploitation of the common people, and the decline and death of the nation and people.</p>
<p>However, the emergence of this particular phenomenon has its own economic background. It not only occurs in a certain circle, but is also prevalent in a certain class. Therefore, its fundamental eradication will not be achieved by the "rectification" of a few leaders who "cleanse away old filth," but only by changing the economic system that is mutually causal.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Impressions of the Performance of "Ladies and Gentlemen" <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Gaoyuan</p>
<p>First of all, we cannot help but admire the enthusiasm of the Youth Association's Intellectual Education Department in promoting drama. After the many difficulties of script selection and rehearsal mentioned in the "opening speech," they were finally able to stage such a new script as "Ladies and Gentlemen," giving us a visual feast. Moreover, "on the one hand, we hope that the audience can arouse interest in studying drama, and actively participate, so as to form a drama research association." We hope that this performance can further achieve this goal, and that another strong new force will be added to the drama movement. How happy we should be!</p>
<p>According to the author, the script of "Ladies and Gentlemen" was written in a hurry, like the "original manuscript written on wax paper." However, the result is that the script does not have many shortcomings due to being written in a "hurry." From the impression gained on the stage, this script is quite successful.</p>
<p>The story unfolded in the three-act play must be considered quite complex. The life of a factory owner's family, factory affairs, and the entire noble social stratum, the shaking situation of the industrial and financial circles under the current domestic and foreign economic and political internal contradictions, and the struggles of workers in the factory, etc., are all handled quite thoroughly by the author, without appearing to be piled up or wordy. Various situations are expressed with very short dialogues and actions. This economical handling of the subject matter is the primary reason for the success of this script.</p>
<p>The character portrayals in the play are also clear enough, only the factory owner Zhou Zhenhua is not sufficiently portrayed. Or rather, it is quite inappropriate and worth discussing. A 51-year-old Chinese industrial tycoon, even if he is old, and the bankruptcy of the factory is due to the political and economic panic, which cannot be saved by individual efforts, I don't think he should be someone who doesn't even know "how he got rich" or "when his son was born." In this way, it will make the audience think that his industrial bankruptcy is due to his own incompetence and poor management, which is very possible. I wonder what the author thinks about this.</p>
<p>In addition, Zhou's wife, who smokes opium and chants Buddhist scriptures, the concubine who eloped with the secretary, and his daughter Zhou Liying, the most popular socialite in high society, are all very clearly portrayed. The secretary who seduced the concubine to elope and the creditors who pressed for debt seem to be slightly less characterized. As for Wang Ma and the chauffeur, the opening scene introduces the lives of the servants with their ambiguous behavior of hiding behind the screen to kiss and hug, which is very interesting and characteristic. The opening and closing of each scene are very natural and compact. The opening of the second act introduces the nanny's family situation and provokes the concubine's scolding; instead of the borrower, the creditor comes; agreeing to mortgage the property and encountering a workers' strike; the concubine elopes, and the first wife comes out with a smoking pipe in hand to curse; and the loan has not been received, and the borrower commits suicide because of the failure of the bid speculation; these are all tense and able to capture the audience's emotions.</p>
<p>The whole play quite exposes the incurable corrupt life of the noble people, the bankruptcy of China's national industry, the economic panic in the financial capitalist society, the "money-meat" relationship between men and women in high society, and the rise of another new social force.</p>
<p>Precisely because of the above meaning, if the occurrence of the workers' strike was at the very end of the play, I think it would be more tense and more important. Although the workers' strike occurred, Mr. Zhou still thought that as long as the loan was obtained and the workers' demands were met, the factory would still not have problems, until the borrower's bid speculation failed and he committed suicide, he had no final solution. Here, there is a shadow of the author taking the lighter and avoiding the heavier.</p>
<p>The scenery and lighting seem to have taken some effort, but the scenery of the first act (same as the third act) seems to represent an old-fashioned family, and cannot fully represent the residence of a big capitalist. Of course, China's national capitalists have a feudal atmosphere, and Mrs. Zhou still chants Buddhist scriptures, but the whole scene is full of the atmosphere of a feudal family, focusing on the old aspect.</p>
<p>In addition, the plaster statue in the second act is for decoration and is too dim. When Wang Ma took out the telephone in the third act, it was very clear that it was made of light paper, and the bottom was wood-yellow; the child held in her arms was also light, and the actors did not handle it carefully; the sound effects of the child's crying and the car horn were not like the real thing, but these are all minor details.</p>
<p>The playwright and director have put in great effort. The performances of the actors Liu Yin, Zhou Dao, and Hong Dou were all very successful, but Liu Yin's makeup was not old enough, and Zhou Boxun's makeup seemed to be more greasy and bloody. If the costumes were more gorgeous, it would better enrich his capitalist character. The appearance of being poor and frustrated in the first act reduced the effect considerably. Jinshan's secretary has not fully shown his ability to seduce the concubine to elope and how to curry favor with the factory owner in front of the factory owner. Sha Bai's creditor also has not</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>done his best to press for debt. I think this is related to the actors' characters. The rest, Li Ping's nanny's voice was a little low, and the Mandarin was not clear in a few places, but because of her sorrowful character, these did not cause much harm. The abandoned Wang Ma and Zhuo Jianchao's chauffeur were both good. I regret that I only watched the first show on the first day. I think the later shows must have improved a lot. Overall, the performance of this play was quite successful, and many places where effects should have been achieved did not slip away. Here we can see the dim future of China's national industry, the irredeemable economic panic, and the corrupt life of the upper class. The playwright, director, and actors are all very hardworking.

<h3 id="e213">Death <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Death, a common death, the death of a small animal being brutally killed.</p>
<p>This death, even if it befalls someone, may not be more than "common" or "great." But now, it is only the death of a cat.</p>
<p>This cat, a stray cat on the street, lives in a black-spotted fur coat with its thin limbs. Its four small legs are connected to a flat stomach, which is obviously an animal that is often unable to eat its fill. I saw it smelling and pawing around the trash can; I also saw it hiding under the eaves at night with its eyes closed. But whenever I passed by or approached it, it would always run far away from me and then stop and turn around to look at me. It would meow, I heard it, like other cats, but the sound was weaker. Especially, when someone gave it something to eat, it would meow in a grateful tone. —It would do these things, only these things. It was too weak! It could not drag live chickens to eat, and could not steal goldfish to eat, so it deserved to be so thin!</p>
<p>But, good, the fate of this little animal had a turning point—it seemed to have a period where it could live a comfortable life. That was because an old woman who lived in the same house as me took it in because she pitied it for being hungry. So, now, it had changed from a stray life to a leisurely life: when it wanted to eat, there was ready-made white rice waiting for it to fill its stomach; when it wanted to sleep, there was a comfortable nest specially made for it. How lucky! This little animal's body had a home.</p>
<p>"Humans are indeed great and kind!" It should think like this now: "God! I thank you, thank you for giving birth to humans in this universe!" Indeed, it was going to be extremely happy, much more lively than before. Sometimes I would also stroke it with my hand, and it no longer feared and avoided me like before, and even raised its head and meowed a few times. Looking at its appearance, it seemed very satisfied with its current life. Time was flying forward day by day, and the fur on this little animal's body gradually became shiny, and its body slowly became fat. Undoubtedly, the current life had shown its influence on its physiology. Here, I absolutely did not think that after this leisurely life, there would be a crisis lurking that would ruin this little animal!</p>
<p>The old woman who gave it food every day probably left home for some reason and did not return for more than a month. Not only was no one taking care of this little animal's food and lodging, but it was also immediately driven out. The reason was that it would poop and pee everywhere.</p>
<p>From then on, its footprints often appeared next to the trash can and under the eaves. It still smelled, pawed, stretched, and closed its eyes, just like before, without resentment. Not only did it not resent, but it was also able to not forget that it had once lived in the house. So it still came often, continuously. Finally, people developed an extremely disgusted feeling towards it: the next time they saw it coming, they would break its legs.</p>
<p>Small animals are always small animals. It has no reason and even less knows about the fickleness of human feelings. One morning it ran over and finally gave its own life.</p>
<p>There was always a reason for everything. On that morning, people discovered that one piece was missing from a chicken stewed in a pot. After speculation, it was determined that the cat had eaten it. So the crime was sentenced, just waiting for execution.</p>
<p>Catching a cat was of course extremely easy. It was captured when it ran over. Then two ropes were tied to its four legs, and one person grabbed its tail and dragged it out of the door.</p>
<p>"Are you really going to execute it?" I finally asked.</p>
<p>This person did not answer me, but took this tied-up little animal and walked out. After a while, the sound of a stick beating reached my ears.</p>
<p>"Dead," this person said when he returned.</p>
<p>"…………"</p>
<p>Ah! Common death, just a small animal</p>
<p>The death of being brutally killed.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Her Father Was So Angry He Hated Her <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>There is a matter concerning my friend. Please reply immediately after receiving the letter in the Amateur Mailbox. Because I am about to leave Shanghai, and my friend's matter may change, please help me as much as possible. Not only will my friend be grateful, but I will also be very grateful. Sincerely, I wish you</p>
<p>Peace. Green Plum respectfully.</p>
<p>The matter asked about is written on the left:</p>
<p>My friend, Miss Wu, is studying at S Girls' School. She grew up in a very conservative aristocratic family. Last summer, a friend of her father acted as a matchmaker for her. It is said that the other party is very wealthy, but the family is very complicated, being a large family with concubines. Miss Wu, seeing that women often have unhappy marriages after marrying, wants to remain single. When her father told her that someone was proposing marriage for her, she opposed it, but her father ignored her and continued with the marriage. On the day the formal introduction was scheduled, Miss Wu suddenly fell ill and could not go. Her father was very angry. Later, with the persuasion of relatives, her father felt a little better and asked Wu if she was willing to get married. She replied, "I want to remain single." Her father said, "A woman who is single is not reliable, and who will she rely on after her parents die?" Her father absolutely would not let her go out to work, thinking it would be a loss of face, and told others: "No matter what, I will marry this daughter of mine off." However, Miss Wu strongly opposed it. At the time, her mother also did not approve of it, because the other party was a playboy and a hopelessly conservative family, so her mother did not want her daughter to suffer the hardship of being a daughter-in-law in such an old-fashioned family. Later, because of strong resistance, she actually rejected the marriage. But her father was very angry and from then on, he did not pay much attention to her, treating her worse than a stranger. Moreover, her father was often unwell because of this, and her father would get angry when he saw her. Miss Wu felt very uncomfortable seeing her father become like this. She thought, what is the point of living if she has lost the love of her dearest parents? Because of all kinds of worries, she regressed in her studies at school. However, her stubborn father still ignored her. She cried secretly every day, regretting that she should not have disobeyed her father's will. Her father wanted her to marry no matter what. If she obeyed her father's will, she really did not want to go to this family. Moreover, during the marriage process, there were all kinds of ominous omens. In addition, now that she has refused, there is no chance to salvage the situation. The mental pain she is currently in is indescribable. She also bears the guilt of being unfilial. She said: She sometimes hates so much that she would rather commit suicide, but she does not dare, because if she commits suicide, her family's relatives will gossip, especially since her family is a well-known family in society. So she is now destroying her own body, hoping to die early. But she still desperately hopes to regain her father's favor. After much thought, she decided: since her father insists that she marry, she might as well marry into the family that her father is satisfied with, and she can ignore all kinds of ominous omens. But she is a woman, how dare she say this? Moreover, the matchmaker is her father's friend, and she is not familiar with him. If she goes to ask him to re-propose this marriage, her father will know and will probably add fuel to the fire, and will be very angry—hating her for losing face. She is in this situation and really cannot solve her problem. She needs the high-minded Editor to give her a clear path. She does not hope for anything else now, only to gain her father's favor and a kind of mental comfort for herself, and she will be satisfied. Please teach her, sir.</p>
<p>Answer: Your friend, Miss Wu's father is so stubborn, such a person is truly unreasonable. However, your friend, in order to regain her father's favor, is willing to "ignore" herself and destroy herself. This filial piety is indeed admirable, but it is too unconcerned for herself. It is originally not impossible to sacrifice oneself for others, especially for one's dearest father, but we must first discuss whether it is worth sacrificing. We must do what is worthwhile and meaningful, and it is too foolish to do what is not worthwhile and meaningless. Marriage is originally one's own business, and whether the marriage is happy or not is also one's own business. Others can be said to have nothing to do with it, and originally have no right to interfere. Although China still retains the large family system, no one can approve of arranged marriages and not allow free love. Therefore, her opposition to her father arranging her marriage is a very proper thing. Her father hates her opposition and wants to throw a temper, but he is utterly confused, completely disregarding his daughter's feelings and her wishes. Therefore, the editor believes that she does not need to feel uneasy about her father's dissatisfaction and recognize herself as unfilial, let alone reluctantly submit to her own will and "marry into that family." Of course, within the possible range, she should also use various methods to hope to regain her father's favor. However, if other methods do not work and only this method will work, she still must not use this method. It must be known that disobeying one's father's will will certainly bear the "name of unfilial piety" and one's own heart will feel uneasy, but if one marries unhappily in the future and cannot get along with her husband or his family, the "mental pain" may still be "indescribable"! Life may still be meaningless!</p>
<p>In short, her father's anger is his own fault, and he is angry for no reason. As a child, there is no need to blindly follow his will. If he can put himself in his daughter's position and think from her point of view, he will probably regret that he should not have disobeyed his children's will. However, this is only our ideal. We should not have such expectations of him.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that her one "clear path" is that she should have a change in her psychology in the future, that is, "decide her own affairs." She should seek employment, choose a spouse, and not worry about all kinds of vulgar face and things that people gossip about. Of course, this is not to persuade her to go her own way and be stubborn. We only hope that she can do things based on reason. Editor</p>

<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>"Ying Di, it's really you!" The visitor's tone was surprised, as if discovering a great secret.</p>
<p>That familiar voice and posture, I was embarrassed to hum and turn on the light next to the bed. The visitor smiled and watched me. I couldn't believe that my cousin Yuan Wen, who left without saying goodbye, was still as lively as she used to be.</p>
<p>"Wen Jie, what a surprise!"</p>
<p>"Surprise?" She turned around and sat on the edge of the desk.</p>
<p>I returned to my original position and offered her a cigarette. We exchanged glances, seemingly with nothing more to say. The sound of rain on the glass window was still as musical as before, but I no longer had the leisure to appreciate it. I busied myself tidying up.</p>
<p>"Ying Di, when did you come to Hangzhou?" She always said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Last winter," I replied faintly.</p>
<p>"It's been two years since we parted, right?" She looked up as if calculating. "I entered ×× school last summer, and I was so bored that I became the director of music. The weather was so good at noon today (I didn't expect it to rain now). I was dragged by some friends to visit the lake, and I ran into your colleagues at Yue Wang's tomb." She paused, giving a puzzling charming smile. "They always followed me and said frivolous things. In the end, they said that if Zhu Ying came today, even the lazybones would probably get excited."</p>
<p>"Ying Di, I really didn't expect you to come to Hangzhou!" She ended her self-narration with a smile.</p>
<p>Regarding this sudden visitor, Cousin Wen, perhaps because of our past disputes, I initially felt uneasy. But now, hearing her candid account of her intentions, during my day of troubles, I felt like I had found a friend and began to talk to her.</p>
<p>"Last autumn, I fell ill. I rented a small room, which was not convenient for recuperation, so I moved into the hospital." Speaking of this, I couldn't help but laugh. "Zhi Lin kept bothering me every day. I had no choice but to accept the advice of a friend and come here to teach English for twelve hours a week, partly to recuperate. After living here, I became too lazy to move."</p>
<p>"Lazybones, haha..." My cousin's attitude hadn't changed at all. She laughed honestly and unceremoniously. I reluctantly joined in the laughter. She suddenly asked me seriously:</p>
<p>"Ying Di, do you know who Zhi Lin married?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. I was really afraid to hear their names, but now, in an abnormal psychological state, I talked about it with someone I could talk to relatively easily. Instead, she seriously started talking about Zhi Lin. To prevent her from talking about anything else, I took out two cigarettes from the cigarette case, offered her one, lit them, and we started smoking.</p>
<p>"You might think it's an amazing story, Ying Di..." She made a dramatic pause, then leisurely started smoking. She seemed to be waiting for me to ask. However, I wasn't moved by her. At most, Zhi Lin's secret had been caught by her. Seeing that I didn't ask, she finally said, her attitude becoming even more serious, "She married Li Jian!"</p>
<p>She said it word by word, and I heard it word by word—She! Married! Li! Jian!!</p>

<h3 id="e219">Anecdotes and Witticisms of Eskimos in Hollywood (Part One) <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Guangdao</p>
<p>"Eskimo," which was shown at the Great Light Theater a few days ago, is a rare and excellent film that we have encountered in recent years. It can be said to be a widely acclaimed and universally praised blockbuster. I happened to see a passage about the interesting stories of these Eskimos in Hollywood in an old magazine. I found it very interesting, so I translated it to share with readers, hoping it won't feel like yesterday's news. However, before getting into the main text, we can first talk about the origin of these Eskimos and their living habits, etc.</p>
<p>Eskimos live in the far north of America, in Labrador, Greenland, Alaska, and other places in the Arctic. There are also such indigenous people in the far north of Asia, near the Bering Sea. The name "Eskimo" was originally given to them by the American Indians, and it means "people who eat raw meat." From this, we can know that the uncivilized indigenous red people of America are more knowledgeable and advanced than these Eskimos. As for what the Eskimos call themselves, it is Inuit, which means "the people." Because these people have been living in the extremely cold Arctic for tens of millions of years, their bodies cannot develop like those of temperate races, so they are very short. However, because they have to fight against the natural environment in order to survive, they are extremely strong. Therefore, the words "short but sturdy" are accurate to describe them. They rely entirely on fishing and hunting for a living all year round because there are no agricultural products. They eat meat raw, and when there is no fresh meat in winter, they take out the dried meat they have stored and gnaw on it, so their teeth are indeed amazing. After they hunt wild animals, they eat the meat and dry the skin to sew into clothes. They live in leather tents in the summer, and in circular caves made of stones or ice in the winter. There is a small hole for entering and exiting, which is narrow enough for only one person to pass through. About half of such houses are underground, partly to borrow some warmth from the ground, and partly to prevent the strong wind from blowing down the house. These people are probably of the Mongolian race, so their faces are very similar to those of us Asians, but their origins have not been determined by historians. Some say that they migrated from Northern Europe, but there are no traces of such people in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>In the film "Eskimo," in addition to the fishing and hunting scenes, blizzards, etc., which were filmed in the Arctic, a large part of it was also filmed in Hollywood. The director, Van Dyke, transported those actors from the icy and snowy land to sunny and hot California. The various inconveniences in their daily lives and their ignorance made them make many jokes. But at the same time, the simplicity and naturalness of their thoughts, and their inability to lie or flatter, gave the "civilized people" of Hollywood a thought-provoking criticism and advice. We can now record those things in a rambling manner.</p>
<p>When they arrived in Hollywood, just after getting off the train, there was a female star holding a German puppy in her arms. Camo Sook, who specializes in hunting walruses, saw it and laughed at Van Dyke; "How did that little walrus grow legs?" When they saw American women, they said, "American women are too pale; their bodies are too thin; they will freeze to death in the Arctic." Regarding food, they said, "The food is too bad. These things are too soft. It will ruin your teeth." Another person said, "There are too many sounds in your American places. Everything is too fast. Those gas-powered sleds run too fast on the street." Another person said, "There is too much sun here. The sun makes people's skin like that of a seal." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3 id="e220">Review of "Spring Dreams of the Dance Hall" <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Xingqiao</p>
<p>The story of "Spring Dreams of the Dance Hall" is very ordinary, but its performance is extremely moving and can be said to be a successful work.</p>
<p>Set against the background of a dance hall, it depicts the suffering of dance girls, implying the evils of the city and the darkness of society. It grasps people's psychology, gives women today a hint of the path of life, makes the dance girls understand what kind of identity and life it is to be a dance girl, and gives a major lesson to the general dance girls of today. The meaning of the screenwriter is not bad.</p>
<p>The director's skills are still flexible, and there are few flaws in the overall picture. However, there is one place that may have been overlooked by the director, that is, when Zhao Yuquan impersonates Cai Xiaofeng and opens a room in the hotel upstairs in the dance hall. In the eyes of the audience, I am afraid that everyone thinks that Cai Xiaofeng is sick in the hospital, and will never come to the dance hall to open a room, and Li Manman will never believe this. Because the screen cannot show that Xiaofeng has recovered from his illness at this time, and the clothes and shoes that Manman is wearing were brought to her by the dance hall manager when she was taking care of Xiaofeng in the hospital, calling her to the dance hall. This is just like the first day she re-entered the dance hall. The screen does not show that Manman has been back in the dance hall for a while, and Xiaofeng's illness has also recovered, nor has she changed Manman's clothes and shoes to show that it has been many days: naturally, the audience will misunderstand. (Missing chapter but rewarding)</p>

<p>Is it the strange weather in Hollywood?</p>
<p>Hollywood is a special place for brewing romance.</p>
<p>This may be due to the weather. It may also be due to the influence of the film industry. But perhaps it is because those who make movies... those actors, directors, screenwriters, and producers... are mostly young, romantic, adventurous, and magnetic people. But whatever the force, it can brew and promote romance, and at the same time, it can equally break and destroy the established romance.</p>
<p>Taking the marriage of Alice White and Sidney Bartlett as an example, it can be said that it is the ultimate in pessimistic separation and reunion. Sidney Bartlett proposed to Alice White for five years. During this period, he suffered all kinds of sabotage, but the sabotage was not successful after all, and they held a grand wedding in Mexico. Alice was willing to give up her star status in order to marry Bartlett. She ignored the advice of the company and did not listen to the loyal advice of friends, just because she believed that Bartlett was the only lovable man among millions of people. Her unwavering love can also be admired by ordinary young men.</p>
<p>Alice's contract expired, and the company did not renew it with her. In this way, her star status was really ruined. But she was not willing to give in. She and Bartlett worked together to form a dance troupe and performed across the United States. Bartlett also did his best to help her rebuild her reputation. In this way, the couple struggled resolutely for a year and a half, and Alice White's name had become a household name. So one day they returned to Hollywood to restore her former status.</p>
<p>Alice's return to Hollywood caused a sensation, and she actually regained her star status—because she had signed a long-term contract with Universal. However, the weather in Hollywood or the film industry is to blame... Recently, it has been rumored that Alice White and Sidney Bartlett have disagreements. Alice often goes out with another man, and Bartlett often stays with another woman. It is said that they will be divorced soon.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Elliott Comes to China to Film a Yangtze River Movie <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Hollywood producers have made many films in the past that insulted the Chinese people. Despite repeated opposition from the Chinese people, the attitude of the producers towards China remains the same. The problem of MGM's filming of "The Good Earth" has not yet been resolved, and now there is news that Clyde E. Elliott, a producer of horror films, will come to China to film a movie about the Yangtze River. Before their departure, the planned program was:</p>
<p>Exterior scenes: centered on the Yangtze River, with mountains, rivers, and rural areas as the backdrop. Subjects: Yangtze River floods, epidemics, pirates. Story: depicting the lives of farmers along the Yangtze River, and the floods of the Yangtze River, the prevalence of epidemics, and the rampant piracy. Actors: in addition to those they bring themselves, they hope to have five or six hundred Chinese people participate.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned plan is true, then it is undoubtedly another film that insults the country. The purpose is nothing more than to point out the Chinese people's inability to prevent river floods, expose the farmers' ignorance of hygiene, leading to the prevalence of epidemics, and the rampant piracy everywhere, revealing the weakness of an unsettled society, which is very obvious. Regarding this issue, we hope that the government and the people of the country will pay attention to the state of its development. If this is true, we should naturally refuse to shoot it.</p>
<p>Elliott is a famous Hollywood director, known for filming travel horror films. He has been to South America and Africa to shoot many animal films, and "Bring 'Em Back Alive" and "Devil Tiger" are his two most successful films. The former had a special box office record when it was released, and the latter will be released soon.</p>
<p>It is said that the filming team has decided to set off in early April, so they expect to arrive in China during the Yangtze River floods. Elliott also believes that this period is also the time when piracy is most rampant along the Yangtze River. They will disregard all dangers and carry out filming work based on the above three points, floods, epidemics, and pirates, for a period of about six months. His wife and daughter will also come to China. I wonder how the Chinese authorities will respond to this news.</p>
<h3 id="e223">"Sports Queen"'s Morning Exercises <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The day after filming the bathroom scene of "Sports Queen," director Sun Yu came up with another dormitory gimmick. When the sun poked its head out from the east mountain and opened its blood-red eyes to look into the dormitory of Jinghua School, countless healthy female athletes were lying on rows and rows of iron beds, performing morning exercises on the bed: exercising their arms and legs. Although they were all bare-chested and wore short shirts and underwear, director Sun's technique would never arouse any strange feelings. It could only make people feel that this was a serious and correct need, and perhaps make people feel ashamed of their own weakness. However, the conversation should turn around. Although this scenery is not sensual, it is very beautiful. The posture of the actors, the angle of the camera, the lighting facilities... are all very exquisite. When the arms and legs are raised together, row by row, in unison, or interwoven into various patterns, it is really heartening to see and unwilling to look away.</p>
<h3 id="e224">"Flames" Is Released, "Woman" Will Be Completed Soon <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>China's first film with fire as its backdrop, "Flames," was sent to Nanjing for inspection after it was completed. Because the quality and quantity were very sufficient, the inspection was quite satisfactory, and "Flames" was immediately approved.</p>
<p>The male lead of "Flames" is Peng Fei, a nationally renowned strongman, and the female lead is Hu Ping, who has considerable qualifications. Both of them have profound performances in the film, and the scene is magnificent, which is rare in domestic films. It has been decided that this film will be shown in the first-run theaters in Shanghai at the end of this month. Movie fans should pay attention to the huge advertisements in various newspapers these two days.</p>
<p>Here is another piece of news. Shi Dongshan's film "Woman" will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3 id="e225">Catherine the Great, Scarlet Empress (Ten) (One) <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Sumei</p>
<p>Catherine looked at his eyes, which seemed to be burning with the fire of love, but her attitude was as cold as ice. She said, "Please don't worry about me. Over the years, I have also understood what kind of person Russia needs from me, so I have also decided not to leave here." Alexei begged her, "Let me help you!" But Catherine shook her head and said, "I don't need your help. I will make my own decisions." After she finished speaking, she stretched out her hand for him to kiss and left him.</p>
<p>In the hall below, there was a sound of footsteps. Grand Duke Peter was leading a small team of soldiers and was walking over. They blocked Catherine's way. Peter suddenly ordered the soldiers, "Ready... aim..." He suddenly said to Catherine, as if he had not seen her just now, "Oh! Why didn't I see you... What a good target!" He then dismissed the soldiers first, and then walked up to Catherine and said in a low voice, "Come to my bedroom, I will introduce you to someone you don't know. He wants to live here for a long time." Catherine listened to him and ran to his bedroom without hesitation. There, she saw many toys everywhere. On a small piece of wood, there was a prototype of Catherine. The Grand Duke raised his knife and cut off its head with a wave. Peter laughed like a madman, "You don't know this kind of toy, I find it the most enjoyable." He then pulled open a small door, bowed, and Elizabeth came in. Catherine greeted her casually and said, "The Empress will be very happy if she hears that you are back." Peter said, "She won't know unless you tell her, but my advice to you is that it's better not to tell her." Catherine snorted and said, "I'll tell her? I can't even dream of doing it. She has her own group of secret detectives. And I won't interfere with what you like, as long as you don't interfere with my affairs." Elizabeth lifted her nose and said, "Let me tell you as soon as possible. When that old bat dies, Peter will marry me... Of course, the current Grand Duchess must be removed!" Catherine pretended not to hear Elizabeth's words and spun the horse-drawn carriage toy. She smiled at Peter and said, "Peter, are you still playing with this toy? You play with your toy, and I play with my toy." She said, and then walked away. Peter waited for Catherine to leave, then raised his knife and stabbed another Catherine prototype in the chest.</p>
<p>The Empress really died. The coffin was placed in the main hall, guarded by solemn soldiers on all sides. On the Empress's coffin sat a parrot and a monkey. Peter had already ascended the throne and was called the Tsar of All Russia. Flames of intrigue and counter-intrigue were fanned up on all sides of the palace. Catherine was inspecting the soldiers again, and bestowing many new favors on the young officers. The power holders of the state and the church held important meetings every day. One day Alexei came to secretly see Catherine again. He said, "Your Majesty, you are even more beautiful than ever." The Empress smiled. He said, "Do you really still like me that much?"
