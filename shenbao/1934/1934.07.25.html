<p>（北平）戰區交涉、殷同奉黃郛派遣、代表赴大連出席中日代表會議、日方參加者爲塘沽停戰恊定首席代表關東軍參謀大佐喜多誠一、及關東軍參副官岡村寗次、日使館武官柴山、二十三晚舉行初步交換意見、二十四日起舉行正式會議、關於會商内容、分長城綫關東軍應卽遵照塘沽停戰恊定撤退、戰區治安問題、甲。冀省府編保安隊接防額數、携帶武器之確定、乙、趙雷·劉作舟·胡恊五·舊部改編處置辦法、丙、取締日鮮浪人販售毒物設賭及其他非法行動、恊商結果、由殷隨時電黃請示、（二十四日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）大連會議、傳岡村向殷同表露、華北中日經濟提携、中日鐵遺聯運、等問題、附帶解决意、（二十四日）</p>
<p>（天津）關東軍參謀長岡村、今午前乘飛機偕幕僚三名、由長春飛抵大連、與殷同會晤、大連會議在星個浦海濱太和旅館舉行、殷同卽寓該處、（二十四日專電）　　（北平）殷同抵大連後、已與日武官柴山關東軍代表宮崎等多人晤面、聞殷等今日開始商談戰區各項問題、純採談話方式、避免正式會議形式、談判時僅提出我方保安隊開入戰區、及長城各口日軍撤退、接收馬蘭峪、取締日韓浪人在戰區内攪擾等、（二十四日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）某外人接大連電稱殷同二十三晚抵大連、柴山等數人碼頭迎接、下榻大和旅館、滿鐵株式會社卽晚在大和飯廳歡宴殷、賓主共二十餘人、殷住室爲超等級、係滿鐵社代備、計寢室會客浴室僕役房各一間、日警署派便衣警探四人隨護、殷對往訪之中日記者、拒絶接見、今晨十時、柴山喜多岡村同往大和旅館訪殷、卽於會客室開始密談、關防甚嚴、殷住址鄰房及過道、均有日警警戒、不準閑人逗留、迄午發電時止、會尙未散、預測會議結果、無何週折、殷在連無多勾留、二十五下午離連返津、柴山是否同行未定、（二十四專電）</p>
<p>（北平）雷壽榮談、大連會議舉行、本人决不往參加、最近期間、亦無離平意、（二十四日專電）</p>
<p>（大連）殷同與岡村少將等日方之會商、已於今午完畢、聞祗談及華北之次要問題、廢棄塘沽恊定及日軍撤除問題、全未提議、此後决定在大連北平兩地間作長期之數片的磋商、華日雙方工表亦另行選定、（二十四日華聯電）</p>
<p>（大連）今日會商後、殷同對記者團發表談話、謂今日互雙開胸襟會談耳、不願多言、岡村少將又作談話、謂廢止塘沽恊定及撤退日軍問題、未談及、此後將時常會談、黃郛氏未有囑附、此次之會商已完畢、（二十四日華聯電）</p>
<p>（大連）大連中日談判完畢後、岡村少將之談話如下、今日之會議、祗懇談停戰恊定區域内之瑣碎問題、故並未涉及撤廢停戰恊定、以及日軍撤退問題、今後於北平山海關等處、將常懇談、其内容祗及至瑣碎之問題、今後雙方將各派委員、進行技術的研究、平整會長黃郛在此會議無何傳言、惟時勢關係、無一刺戟神經之問題、又中國代表殷同之談話如下、僅談論停戰恊定區域内之小問題、故毫未涉及華北政情及撤廢停戰恊定等問題、殷同因目的之談判、業已完畢、定二十八日乘天津丸歸國、（二十四日電通電）</p>
<p>（大連）大連會議開至本日午後一時止、其間經過三小時、關東軍參謀副長岡村於會議後語人如左、今日在會議席上與殷同氏披瀝胸襟、凡由停戰恊定所發生之各種枝節問題、均已交換意見、尤以停戰區域内之治安維持及其他技術上之問題、亦相當行使討論、此次會談之結果、今後亦可時相聚首、藉圖整理而謀解决懸案、至於廢除停戰恊定、此時當無提出討論之必要也、又岡村少將已於本日夕刻偕喜多大佐遄返長春矣、（二十四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（大連）大連中日會議、因關東軍參謀喜多大佐來連、於昨午后八時在星浦舉行、關東軍參謀副長岡村少將喜多大佐北平駐在武官柴山中佐泉副官、中國方面殷同等出席、未採會議之形式、均着浴衣、同食晚餐後、續由殷同與岡村副長以下、往復辦論、未有具體的决定、於談笑之裏、午后十一時散會、從二十四日上午十時起、開始討論具體的問題、（二十四日電通電）</p>
<p>（大連）大連會商漸次負有重要性、中國方面因停戰恊定之存在、使黃郛政權陷於困境、此際謀以恢復華北平常狀態爲中心、解决懸案、故殷同屢次與柴山武官預備交涉、提議在大連開最後會議、然日本方面以常識而言、華方無代替全般撤廢停戰恊定要求之政治恊定、則對撤廢該恊定、抱絶對反對態度、因此大連會商似無多大期待、又華方若無重大提議、則今日之會談、大體可視作終了、（二十四日電通社電）</p>
<p>（大連）第二次中日會談、今日上午九時半在『里家』開會、日本方面出席者岡村少將·喜多大佐·柴山中佐·中國方面係殷同、在二層樓之一室密議、惟撤廢停戰恊定問題、因關東軍態度强硬、致會談前途早已悲觀、（二十四日電通社電）</p>
<p>（大連）今日爲大連中日談判之第二日、對於停戰恊定區域内之諸問題、雙方曾重複懇談、但未涉及最重要問題之撤廢停戰恊定、因此未言及撤退日本軍問題、談判似極簡單完畢、但今後在北平山海關大連等處、將常舉行此種談判、因此由中日兩方面派出委員、又岡村少將因談判已畢、定二十八日乘車返任、（二十四日電通社電）</p>
<p>（大連）確聞二十三日夜之中日會談、亦曾槪括議論中日之經濟提携問題、又出席該會談約一小時之久田滿鐵副總裁、曾陳述滿鐵方面之意見、（二十四日電通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）陸軍中央部關於撤廢停戰恊定之見解如下、中國似因通車問題業已解决、故希望撤廢停戰恊定、但該恊定之成立原因、乃因戰爭停止後、中國之對日態度、與交戰當時相同、未能返歸正常之故、致通郵設關等問題、未有眉目、况現在全中國之狀態、關於對日關係、實質惡化、故撤廢該恊定事、無根本理由存在、因此關東軍難容納中國之希望、華方雖傳黃郛不能北上、惟日本之主張、非可變動者、（二十四日電通社電）</p>

<h3 id="c19">不承認主義之又一試騐廷· <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>當僞國成立之初。謝逆介石嘗發表對外通告。以開放滿洲門户與履行國際義務兩點爲餌。引誘各國予以正式之承認。而各國則遵守國聯决議及史蒂生主義之精神。相率置之不理。日人對此國際不承認主議。雖陽作鎭靜。故示淡泊。實則如骨鯁喉。不去不快。終乃與中美小國薩爾瓦多相勾結。以期挽回於萬一。觀其處心積慮可憐亦復可畏。</p>
<p>日人一方欲博得國際幾微之同情。一方欲確保僞滿整個之統制。遂致言行相違。而莫由自解。自僞滿成立以迄今日。外人在滿。依然享受領事裁判權而日本以外之各國駐滿領事。亦依然根據中國國府主席所頒之『認可狀』而行使其職務。同時仍繼續受其駐華使署之節制。由此二點。足徵所謂不承認主義者。固有其積極之意義。過去日本及僞滿當局。所以自甘默認者。實因全局未定。不欲操之過急耳。</p>
<p>然日人對此權宜辦法。究不願恝然置之。矧當日俄邦交日益緊張倫敦會議行將開幕之秋。僞滿國際地位不確。立尤將貽將來莫大之隱憂蓋一旦日俄開戰。僞滿有『日滿議定書』之束縛。自不能不與日人取同調。而實行參戰。然在中立國之眼光。僞滿固爲中國之領土。中國不參戰。僞滿又焉能獨行其是。僞滿旣以參戰國自命。不免有實行戰時國際法之决心。因是而引起之糾紛。實爲嚴重。吾人皆知在第二次日俄戰爭中。日人必將發挥其優勢海軍之威力。今以海軍條約之限制。不能加以盡量之擴充、故不得不假借僞滿海軍之名義。而添建艦艇。預料在將來日俄戰爭期間。必有懸掛僞滿旗幟之日本軍艦出現於公海。以實行共搜查中立國船隻之權利。但若不先使中立國承認僞滿爲一國家。則不但不能貫澈其戰時之使命。且將與中立國發生重大之齟齬。而陷日本於窘境。卽在僞滿境内之外人利益。亦將因當地參戰與中立之區别。而蒙連帶之影響。此而不决。糾紛必多。可斷言也。且對俄作戰。日人固抱必勝之雄心、依其預測。第一次日俄戰爭終了時之高麗。實等於今日之僞滿。第二次日俄戰事終了時之僞滿。將必爲今日之高麗。若僞滿能早得各國之承認。届時與日合併。可以直抄亡韓故事。不再謀各國之諒解。</p>
<p>又有進者。日本雖在假借僞滿名義而添建艦艇。以有英美等國之監視。究不能暢所欲爲。若僞滿能蒙各國承認而躋於國際社會之列。則隨時擴充海軍。固爲其應有之權利。非各國所得而置喙。若然。則日人固可不待倫敦會議之折衝而已足操勝利之左券。</p>
<p>顧日人心理。列强早所洞悉。且不承認主義對於英美俄等國之實際利益或猶在中國之上。故縱無國聯决議與史蒂生宣言之束縛。亦必不致貿然而放棄。據十九日路透社東京消息。外務省擬卽修改滿洲門户開放機會均等之原則。以爲强迫承認之先聲。而是近關東軍司令部復要求取締山海關境内英軍之調動。故予締結辛丑條約各國以難堪。推其用意。無非欲各國感覺事實上之困難。縱不能積極承認『滿洲國』爲一獨立之國家。亦當消極默認『滿洲國』爲非中國之領土。此二事之變化若何。猶難逆料。而不承認主義。又多一番嚴重之試騐。則無可疑。英美俄以外諸國。果能堅持其原來之立塲耶。抑將屈服於日人之威脅耶。</p>

<p>（倫敦）據航空大臣倫登特里勳爵今日告上議院、英國擴張空軍之程序、至一九三八年止、共需費二千萬鎊、此項程序、志在挽回軍備競爭、他日告成、則皇家空軍所居之地位、除非英國繼續建造、則未能達到平等、而亦易續事擴張、迅速成功、惟渠希望此種事態、可由國際恊定避免之云、按航空大臣此番言論、乃答覆工黨議員彭森璧勳爵動議對軍縮會議未終止前增加軍備表示遺憾者、（二十三日路透社電）</p>

<p>雙方因交換品發生爭執</p>
<p>第三次會議已得有轉機</p>
<p>决另組專家委員會討論</p>
<p>自日本利用其人工低廉、及運輸便利、對南洋實行傾銷政策以來、荷屬東印度之市塲、幾盡被獨佔、不但歐洲各國貨品之銷路、大受影響、卽荷蘭本國出品之市塲、亦有完全被奪之虞、予荷印農業與工業以極大之威脅、如爪哇因連年豐收、糧食充裕、若仍任廉價之日米自由進口、則本地米價必大跌、農民生計勢將受極大影響、土人若因生活不能維持而有軌外行動時、其影響治安、更非淺鮮、故爲維持治安與保護本地農產品起見、荷印政府乃不得不頒佈限制外米進口條例、又如日本之廉價士敏士、幾將巴東之士敏士打倒、荷印爲保護自已之工業起見、亦不得不限制日貨之輸入、再如『紗籠』（土人男女所穿之圍裙）一業、原爲荷印土人工業之最重要者、但連年因日貨傾銷、土人的沙籠業大受影響、幾有完全破產之勢、且由荷蘭輸入之『紗籠』本亦不少、年來受日貨排斥、亦已逐漸减少、如不及早挽救、勢必銷路盡塞、故爲保護土人工業與推銷本國出品起見、限制織造品輸入之條例、自不能不頒佈矣、</p>
<p>荷印相繼頒佈各種限制條例後、日本大爲恐慌、蓋眼見其不久奪得之大好市塲將因此而失去、於是不得不設法挽救、乃向荷蘭提議、開一『日荷商業會議』、冀彷照日印會議之前例、以與英國瓜分印度市塲之方法、與荷蘭瓜分東印度之市塲也、惟日印恊定所以能成立、乃因印度之棉花爲日本所需要、而織造品亦爲印度所需要、故以棉花易織造品、雙方皆樂於接受、但荷印方面情形不同、並無日本所需要之商品、荷印最大宗之出產、爲糖·錫·椰乾·橡皮·烟葉·咖啡·煤油·等項、其中以糖之銷路爲最遜、如日本欲與荷印作物品交換之恊定、荷印方面甚願以糖與日本作交換品、但日本方面絶對不需要荷印之糖、因臺灣之糖、不但足够日本應用、且正謀擴充世界市塲、故日方僅欲多買荷印之橡皮·烟葉·咖啡·及煤油等商品而已、在荷印則堅持非以糖爲交換品不可、雙方因此而起爭執、</p>
<p>日荷會議原定五月舉行、直至六月底方始開議、截至上月二十七日止、雙方代表已舉行會議三次、其第一及第二兩次會議、雙方代表皆各執已見、除引起激辯外、毫無結果、日方之理由、以爲荷印最近之舉動、限制日貨輸入、乃違反『日荷通商航海條約中之最惠國』條欵、態度甚爲强硬、而荷方則以『日貨在荷印市塲激烈之競爭、荷印政府鑒於此種情勢、爲使本國經濟的及社會的生活安定、以及防止荷印經濟狀態起異常糾紛起見、根據本國之絶對自由權、不得不採用此新的措置』爲詞、態度亦甚强硬、如此雙方堅持、前途極難樂觀、惟當六月二十七日第三次會議時、雙方忽議决組織一專門委員會、聘請專家搜集各種報告、再作詳細商議、商議之結果如何、雖此時尙難逆料、但以大勢言之、此舉不可謂非一極大之轉機也、以記者觀察、預料最後荷蘭方面、勢必作相當之讓步、蓋欲堅持以糖與日本交換織物、勢難實現也、（十一日）</p>

<p>據銀錢兩業領袖之意見、謂此次申新各廠無論政府對付之態度及採取之方針如何、在銀錢方面、必當竭力維護其存在、以申新各廠規模之大、所僱用職工之多、及每年購買原料及其他物品數量之鉅、直接間接依以爲生者、不下數百萬人、而滬上金融界、與申新有往來關係者、爲數甚鉅、如上海中國等銀行之工業放欵、以申新爲最多、如一旦果有動搖、銀錢兩業、固蒙影響、社會安寗與整個商業市塲、均將有所不利、且榮宗敬氏、在今日中國已爲碩果僅存之實業家、以紡紗錠數言、佔全國總數之五分之一、爲國家企業計、朝野上下、亦必一致恊助其前進、故銀錢業對於該廠等之維護誠意、無論將來情勢如何、必無變更云、至產業界發生恐慌、現在固爲世界一般之現象、卽我國十餘年前、亦一度有此也、歐戰時、我國紡織廠業如雨後春筍之勃起、其時申新紗廠、亦大事擴充、當時外匯甚廉、原料機器成本較輕、迨歐戰告終、外匯突漲、未淸貨欵、突增倍餘、致一時陷於周轉不靈、當時亦由銀錢業盡力維持、未蒙影響、其後市况較佳、申新各廠、亦轉趨繁榮、逐年擴充、至今已由四廠增至九廠矣、</p>

<p>指導先生：</p>
<p>我有一個問題、要求先生解答，這雖不是書本上的問題，但於我們的求知上有着密切的關係、我想先生大約不致於吝敎吧。</p>
<p>據報載，今年的熱度，打破了六十年未有的紀錄，如果再不下雨，則赤地千里，旱災一定是很怕人的。</p>
<p>中國本是個靠天吃飯的國家；可是，幾年來，天公偏要和她爲難，天災人禍，接踵而至，於是弄得朝野人士，對求神拜佛，忙得不可開交：帝國主義來侵略啦，設時輪金剛法會；洪水汜濫啦，也是設時輪金剛法會；如今，旱象已成，又於時輪金剛法會之外，再加上一個張天師設壇求雨了。</p>
<p>朝野人士的關心民間疾苦，是無須我曉舌的，然而，問題是：這種求雨，是不是與事實有補呢？</p>
<p>二十世紀，是科學的時代，不是神權的時代，雨如可求的話，天公何必多此一舉，弄成這樣的旱災？且張天師自已，已經是有家歸未得的人，班禪活佛的隨從，在這暑天，就熱死了不少，自身不保，豈能保人？不久前，市上曾發現過科學靈乩，誰都明白這是一種迷信，有點近於妖言惑衆，然現在的設壇求雨，豈有勝於科學靈乩？兩者相較，方式雖不同，其實則一。何社會人士，對於這，不僅不揭穿它的迷信作用，甚至有人稱道？豈皆爲求雨這一好聽的名辭所迷惑嗎？</p>
<p>要知：設壇求雨，只是借名歛　，求有效用，萬萬是不可能的。全國勞苦民衆，於天　人禍襲擊之下，再來一次旱災，只有坐着等死了。我們再不能迷信，我們需要科學的救濟！</p>
<p>報傳，蘇俄發明了科學求雨的方法，如果先生知道這方法，希望立即公開出來，因爲這雖然並不會馬上引起朝野人士的注意，來一次大規模的科學求雨的試騐，但多少可給一些迷信家們相當的打擊，而使民衆知到只有科學的求雨才可挽救旱災，一切迷信，均是欺人的！</p>
<p>我熱切地盼望着答覆！　　丨朱明丨</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>因爲伊從小就憑父母作主，配給皇太后的兄弟的兒子，丨便是太后的内姪丨做妻子。不料待到一切事情都準好，結婚的日子也日擇定，突然那位未婚夫竟死了。照中國舊時代的習慣，伊雖然並不曾和那未婚夫發生過眞正的夫妻關係，但是也得照樣的嫁過去，替他守寡，永遠不用想再嫁别人了；而元大奶奶的稱謂，也畢竟加到了伊的頭上去！伊其時還祇是一個十八歲的天眞活潑的小姑娘咧，可是在名義上，伊已經變爲了一個狠苦的居喪的小寡婦了！中國舊禮敎的慘酷，確是無可掩飾的事實。當我在宮中和伊相會的時候，伊恰好是二十四歳：而伊的神態，却已跟四五十歲的老婦人一般無二了。在伊的一生中，可說是不再有什麽幸福或快樂可言！伊絶對不許和任何一個男人談話，也不能隨便的縱聲大笑；而且必須永遠的留在宮内，一直到伊的靈魂脫離伊的軀殻爲止。不過有一點是伊的造化！就是伊的天性是很愚笨木訥的，對於人生，簡直毫無認識，所以伊的環境雖是這樣的悽凉哀痛，但伊竟像没有感覺到的一樣。</p>
<p>其餘的幾位女官，都是跟皇上同姓的近族中的姑娘，並無什麽特點可記。</p>
<p>論到我們這些女官所担任的職務，那眞可說是輕鬆極了。我們全部的工作，便是服待太后：但太后穿衣梳頭等等的事情，也不須我們服侍的。我們只分着兩個人一班，輪流的站在太后的近身，隨便說的，趣的話便行了；不過我們大家都知道，跟太后說話是極容易闖禍的，因此我們總是讓太后自已說，我們却裝着很高興的神氣傾聽着，待伊有什麽問題提出來，才小心翼翼地相機應對。（九○）</p>

<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>寒暑表上的水銀直望頂處伸展的時候，房子裏眞像火桶一樣，熱悶得喘不過氣來，到傍晚，再也不能關禁在屋子裏，好像屋子裏的空氣太少了似的。</p>
<p>到江邊去，已是我們幾天以來的口號。</p>
<p>每當太陽快要下去，我們總是三個入或是兩家頭緩步踱過這小城的橫街，走到空曠的江邊去。那時大輪船有的已經點了燈，江水照例是平靜的，没有風浪，天邊的暮雲也靜靜地，好像受了太陽一天的蒸晒，這一刻也倦了，一絲一絲跳動的火蛇在雲眼裏閃躍，但是没有電聲。</p>
<p>在江上乘風的固然不止我們的一小羣，但是這勝景似乎是專爲我們而有的，我們講着笑着，似乎一天的苦熱在這刻兒業已消失於無形了。</p>
<p>等到大輪船已經走遠了，天空和江水不分了畛域，我們才緩步走回來，但是依然回顧着江岸的漁火，好像得捨不得。多早晚我能够在江邊住着不要離開呢？我想。</p>
<p>再重新走着小城的橫街時候，女人家都坐在路上了，赤着上身掛一方小兜肚子，手裏揮着蒲扇在敎唱孩子們的『火螢』歌了。</p>
<p>『……今日窮，明日窮，拾着黃金變做銅。』孩子們唱的火螢歌是苦味的。</p>
<h3 id="c224">游泳和耳病 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>在大熱之天，因爲受不住熱氣的蒸騰，會游水的人，會跳進游泳池或附近的水道中去游水，然而我們在未入水之前，先得要有一些游泳的常識，在游泳池裏游泳，最容易出毛病的便是耳朶，或是池水的混濁，或是起水後没有十分的注意。最好的方法，在入水之前，先把耳朶塞住，而塞耳朶的東西，現在最普通是藥水棉花。</p>
<p>現在正値游泳的時候，但我們要知道普通游泳的結果，尤其是在濁水之中，最容易使耳朶潰爛。這種事件，在設備完美，池水清潔的游泳池中，固未必發生，可是爛過耳朶的人，游泳之後，却最會潰爛。有時還要影響於鼻子的過道，患扁桃腺加答兒等症，尤其是患過腥紅熱，或早年時代患過同樣的病症之後，耳朶發生過毛病而治好的，在水裏游泳，最容易使耳疾復發，然而健康的人，游泳的結果，是不致發生病患的。</p>
<p>這裏，還有一件很重要的事情，便是在游泳的時候，立在很高的地方跳到水裏，震力的傳動，由鼻孔以至耳鼓，而使耳膜震壞，而且還有人說據一般人研究的結果，跳水的時候，脚先下水比頭先下水，像平時的潛水式樣，更容易受震力的影響。關於這點，也許會使人懷疑，然而跳水的時候，水的刺激，爲何比潛水厲害，却是很明顯的，因爲潛水有頭部擋住鼻子的過道。</p>
<p>這樣說來，游泳不是很容易使耳朶潰爛嗎？然而我們事前祗要考慮一下，自已向來有没有耳朶潰爛的毛病，倘然没有呢，那决不會潰爛的。而且現在預防的方法，更爲任何人所知道了，祇要把藥水棉花塞在耳朶中，才去入水游泳，那便不致使耳朶受水的浸漬而潰爛了。</p>

<p>— 承昭</p>
<p>阿毛是這學期新進來的小茶房，敎務主任派他在新樓下服侍學生先生。他生得很矮小和瘦弱，枯瘠的小手，焦黃而無血色的瘦臉，顯然是營養不足所致。平常我們很容易瞧到他的狹小的肩胛上勉强挑着兩桶洗臉水進宿舍裏，那樣搖曵顫抖的身體，委實很可憐的</p>
<p>照理像阿毛那般年齡的孩子，正該安樂地坐在課堂裏廳講，受敎育甘露的灌漑才是：但他的爸爸是做木匠的，每天勞苦所得的酬報，祇能勉强維持他自已的　生活，那裏能够送阿毛進學校呢？於是阿毛被摒斥在學府大門之外，出賣他的稚弱體力，替學生先生服務，一輩子是個茶房啊！</p>
<p>有時，阿毛站在我們的敎室前，疾望我們那種上課的幸福情形，有時，停留在宿舍的窗口瞧我們的自習生活。他這麽好奇和羨慕，竟致亡却了他應做的職務，受到敎務主任的責駡。</p>
<p>在畢業考試的前夕，正當學生們努力預備功課的時候，突然起了一陣騷擾，據說那個小茶房阿毛被開水燙傷了，等我們走去看時，他已被校工抬往醫院去了，祇在操塲的籬笆邊遺留下一大堆的泥水！</p>

<p>— 張亦庵</p>
<p>刮痧，這似乎是不甚文明的一種醫術，然而事實的經騐，使我不能不採用。</p>
<p>以前我水知道而且不信象刮痧這樣的醫術會有什麽效能，並且有點憎厭。我憎厭刮痧的最重大的原因是看見給刮過痧的人，渾身到處現着一縷的紅黑色，眉心，脖子，胸背等處。</p>
<p>自從那一年，大約是六年前光景就是我開始玩攝影的那一年，我才嘗試着刮痧的滋味。那時我剛學會了自已冲洒照片，便把一個亭子間充作黑房。夏天的光綫是最便利於攝影的節季，每天裏陽光照耀的時間是延長了，而光度又特别强，速度極高的動作你也可以用高速度的快門攝取而無感光不足之虞。可是這個節季是最不適宜於冲洗的，因爲氣温高，底片常有溶化之虞，而且盛夏天時關閉在亭子間的黑房裏工作不是怎樣舒適的一件事。我那黑房，上層是水門汀的平頂，下面是廚房。當正午時候，强度的太陽把水門汀的上層晒得滾燙，下面的廚房又正在煮着飯。照例在這樣情形之下是不容工作的了。然而剛學會冲晒的我，正是熱心得萬分，慢說這樣的天氣，便是在非洲我也要動手的，只要有方法保持着膠片的不溶化。</p>
<p>一天，兩天，三天，這麽關閉在黑房裏工作之後，身體覺得有點異樣了：兩肩兩肘兩膝的骨節像給千斤重的東西壓住了；眼皮也像長了搭鈎，要睜開來十分不容易。腦袋裏像空虚了；舌頭因爲長了苔而吃東西不覺得有味道。只想睡，陲醒了還是不想張開眼晴。我把病狀告訴妻，妻說我中暑了。於是十滴藥水，善濟丸等東西便拿來應用了。</p>
<p>十滴藥水適用於救急，我這不是急症，吃下去也不覺得怎樣。普濟丸吃了覺得肚裏好些了，但是眼皮還是重，骨節仍是酸。這樣兩三天，而且捱了兩三天没有吃飯。</p>
<p>『刮刮痧看吧，』妻這樣提議。揚州的女工人許媽立刻表示贊成。</p>
<p>對於刮痧，我雖然一向憎惡，但是經不起伊們的一再鼓勵和疾苦的壓迫，終於硬着頭皮而來一試。</p>
<p>刮痧所用的器械藥物簡單得很：熱水或熱茶一杯，一把湯匙，或一枚銅板而已。茶水有時可代以生油，銅板湯匙又可代以薄薄酌玉片如玉耳環墜之類。</p>
<p>動手給我刮痧的人呌我把衣肥脫得赤裸了，伊便把銅元放在熱水裏潤濕一下，便開始刮。先從肯後做起，你須得坐下來，將背彎着，爲要支持上半身的重量起見，兩手不期然而然地便按住自已的兩膝。起頭刮的幾下，尙不覺得怎樣，但是倘若你當眞是有『痧』的話，那末幾下之後你便會感覺到一種澈骨的奇痛。據說那時候便是『痧』出來了。痧出來者，皮膚開始發紅也。如果是痧重，顏色不特發紅，而且會起紫黑色的泡點。由背脊，而兩肩，而臂灣，而眉心。眉心不用刮面用拉。當我第一次給刮痧時，痛得直跳起來，幾乎不能終其事。可是刮完之後，你渾身所有的痛楚，頓時霍然。這事情雖似不文明，但是不由你不信用。這一次之後，我因爲那兩年攝影的過度熱心，在每個暑天總要刮好幾次。</p>
<p>刮痧所以能治愈中暑，我不能以科學來說明，可是已獲得了我事實上的信仰。</p>

<p>— 康伯度</p>
<p>不料劉半農先生竟忽然病故了，學術界上又短少了一個人。這是應該惋惜的。但我於昔韻學一無所知，毁譽兩面，都不配說一句話。我因些記起的是别一件事，是當現在的白話將被『揚棄』或『唾棄』的檔兒，他也是一位對於現今的白話，尤其是歐化式的白話的偉大的『迎頭痛擊』者。</p>
<p>他曾經有過極不費力，但極有力的妙文：</p>
<p>『我現在只舉一個簡單的例：</p>
<p>子曰：『學而時習之，不亦悅乎？』</p>
<p>這太老式了，不好！『學而時習之，』子曰，『不亦悅乎？』</p>
<p>這好！</p>
<p>『學而時習之』，『不亦悅乎？』子曰。這更好！爲什麽好？歐化了。但『子曰』終没有能歐化到『曰子』！』</p>
<p>這段話見於『中國文法通論』中，那書是一本正經的書；作者又是『新靑年』的同人，五四時代『文學革命』的戰士，現在又成了古人了。中國老例，一死是常常能够增價的，所以我想從新提起，並且提出他終於也是『論語』社的同人，有時不免發些『幽默』；原先也有『幽默』，而這些『幽默』，又不免常常掉到『開玩笑』的陰溝裏去的。</p>
<p>實例也就是上面所引的文章，其實是，那論法，和頑固先生，市井無賴，看見靑年穿洋服，學外國話了，便冷笑道：『可惜鼻子還低，臉孔也不白』的那些話，並没有兩樣的。</p>
<p>自然，劉先生所反對的是『太歐化』。但『太』的範圍是怎樣的呢？他舉出的前三法，古文上没有，談話裏却能有的，對人口談，也都可以懂。只有將『子曰』改成『曰子』是决不能懂的了。然而他在他所反對的歐化文中也尋不出實例來，只好說是『『子曰』終没有能歐化到『曰子』！』那麽，這不是『無的放矢』嗎？</p>
<p>歐化文法的侵入中國白話中的大原因，並非因爲好奇，乃是爲了必要。國粹學家痛恨鬼子氣，但他住在租界裏，便會寫些『霞飛路』，『麥特赫司脫路』那樣的怪地名；評論者何嘗要那奇，但他要說得精密，固有的白話不够用，便只得採些外國的句法。比較的難懂，不像茶淘飯似的可以一口呑下去是眞的，但補這缺點，是精密。胡適先生登在『新靑年』上的『易卜生主義』，比起近時的有些文藝論文來，的確容易懂，但我們不覺得牠却又粗淺，籠統嗎？</p>
<p>如果嘲笑歐化式白話的人，除嘲笑之外，再去試一試紹介外國的精密的論著，又不隨意改變，删削，我想，他一定還能够給我們更好的箴規。</p>
<p>用玩笑來應付敵人，自然也是一種好戰法，但觸着之處，須是對手的致命傷，否則，玩笑終不過是一種單單的玩笑而已。</p>
<h3 id="c260">遣悶 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 風子</p>
<p>這幾天，上海是非常熱鬧的。基督敎在禱告上帝，佛敎會在諷誦經卷，道敎自然也得凑熱鬧，於是就請江西龍虎山第六十三代祖師張瑞齡，登壇作法，消災祈雨。活佛才去，天師又來，中國倘再有所謂災難，那眞只有天曉得了。</p>
<p>但災難確是有的，關於政治經濟的且不說吧，連『民食所維一的農人也都在倒霉了。豐收可以成災，這還是去年的經騐。在從前，當稻子將熟的時候，只要到鎭上茶坊里一打聽，附近州縣有没有鬧災荒，那末對於榖價的貴賤，無論是九斤公公或者七斤嫂嫂，是都能預料的。近幾年可就不行了。西北鬧旱災，長江發大水，榖價該是要貴了吧，然而適得其反。連熟悉全國情形的米商們的預測，也都落了空。原因是：南方有暹羅，東方有台灣，西方有印度，太平洋有橫渡的輪船，這些地方都產米，而且可以很自由地運到中國來的。</p>
<p>於是乎洋米充斥，農村破產，這也成了災。活佛和天師固然無『法』禳解，善士們實在也並不曾想到。</p>
<p>然而對於農民的恩賜，畢竟是並不少的。南京不是有過財政會議麽？那目的是要廢除苛雜，不增田賦，時隔不久，我們記得的。但情形究竟怎樣呢？就我的本鄕講，徵收分上下兩期，每畝正稅計國幣四分，上期附稅如建設特捐，建設附捐，特捐帶徵，自治附捐，敎育附捐，治蟲經費，徵收費，總共每元帶徵一元四角七分九釐。下期附稅如建設特捐，特捐帶徵，建設附捐，附捐帶徵，治蟲經費，黨費附捐，習藝所經費，徵收費，總共每元帶徵九角五分六釐。那就是說，每年付正稅一元的，還得付附稅二元四角三分五釐。然而和去年一比，這是已經减低了幾分的，可見也倒底受了財政會議的影響了。但例外的是：今年又有所謂測繪費，每畝二角五分。田地尙未測量，經費業已預徵，才减去幾分，又加上數角。皮肉已盡，農民的骨脊，大槪是要折下來當柴賣了。</p>
<p>這自然又成了災。活佛淡然，天師默爾，大家也終於無話可說。</p>
<p>但上海倒底是熱鬧的。紳士們多流了幾滴汗，於是乎就亢旱成災。活佛，神父，天師，登壇上座，虔誠祈禱，甘霖果眞沛然地落下來了，雖然不知道究竟是誰的功勞。</p>
<p>雨後新凉，紳士們互相點着頭說：『眞凉爽！這幾天一點兒也不沉悶了。』</p>
<p>然而沉悶是依舊存在的，正和災難一樣，牠是藴藏在另一個人羣里。</p>
<h3 id="c261">道德與文章的矛盾 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 敦龐</p>
<p>清代文壇掌故雜錄之三</p>
<p>王西莊（嗚盛）未第時、嘗館富室家，每入宅時必雙手作摟物狀。人問之，曰：『欲將其財旺氣摟入已懷也』。及仕宦後，秦諉楚諈，多所乾没。人問之曰：『先生學問富有，而乃貪吝不已，不畏後世之名節乎？公曰：『貪鄙不過一時之嘲，學問乃千古之業。余自信文名可以傳世，至百年後，口碑已没，而著作常存。吾之道德文章，猶自在也。』故所著書多慷慨激昂語，蓋自掩貪陋也。</p>
<p>按：這一節足以證明文學之偉大，亦足以證明文學之自由。貪鄙的人，能够藉他的文章，於白年後表示他的道德之高尙，這是偉大處。貪鄙的人，却能做出慷慨激昂的文章，可知性格與文學尙無關係，何况經濟條件階級意識，這是自由處。然而，反過來說，實也不免使人感到『幻滅』。古之文人如此，則今之作風雅語，作革命語的文人，究竟是否風雅，是否革命，也可以懷疑了。道德與文章，原多矛盾，實例不勝枚舉。</p>
<h3 id="c262">幫閒的山人 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 敦麗</p>
<p>清代文壇掌故雜錄之四</p>
<p>陳眉公在王荆石家遇一宦問荆石曰：『此位何人？』曰：『山人。』宦曰：『旣是山人，何不到山裏去？』蓋譏其在貴人門下也。俄就席，宦出令曰：『首要烏名，中要四書二句，末要曲一句合意』。宦首舉云：『十姊妹嫁了八哥兒，八口之家，可以無飢矣，只是二女將誰靠？』眉公曰：『畫眉兒嫁了白頭公，吾老矣，不能用也，辜負了靑春年少。』合座稱賞，宦遂訂交焉。鉛山蔣苕生太史『臨川夢』院本内有『隱奸』一齣，刻意詆毁眉公，出塲詩云：『妝點山林大架子，附庸風雅小名家。終南捷徑無心走，處士虚聲儘力誇。獺祭詩書充著作，蠅營鐘鼎潤烟霞。翩然一隻雲閒鶴，飛去飛來宰相衝一亦謔而虐矣。</p>
<p>按：此節可與上節參看。今人頗多慕明末清初文人的性靈，風格，殊不知當時的山人名士，無非貴人門下的幫閒者。貴人少不了此種人，所以某宦初雖譏刺眉公，終『遂訂交焉』。而此種人離開了貴人·，也做不成山人名士，故眉公被譏而不以爲忤，也終『遂訂交焉』。蔣心餘暴露了『附庸風雅』的『名家』的醜態，或以爲謔虐，誰知他們自已倒毫不爲意呢，但今人之附庸風雅者，其實並非不知道這些情形，好在他們自已也正是這種人耳。</p>

<p>— 盛馬良</p>
<p>柔和的陽光浸着琵琶湖的清晨。</p>
<p>在平靜的湖中飄着一葉小舟，情緒也彷彿湖水一樣地平靜了。</p>
<p>我同茵子是常常陶醉在這兒的，那麽輕柔的軟風，那麽靜靜的波影，……</p>
<p>輕輕地船影慢慢地在平靜的湖上滑着，那樣波浪的音調，是被詩人遺忘的詩意嗎？</p>
<p>美麗的雲影輕輕地飄過，茵子的回憶裏浮上了故鄕的舊夢：平壤的天空，也有那麽輕淡的雲影呵！</p>
<p>丨年靑的人呵！你，你會回憶到支那的故鄕嗎？</p>
<p>丨呵！……</p>
<p>悲哀被藏在淡淡的笑渦裏，二個兒同樣是個飄泊異地的人，呵！茵子，却是一滴浮萍上的露珠啊！</p>
<p>（忘去吧！那凄凉的故鄕啊！）</p>
<p>默默地彈起蒙特靈的絃子，流浪人唱起流浪的歌聲：</p>
<p>『舊時的波痕只照着舊時的夢，</p>
<p>流浪人只唱着流浪的歌，</p>
<p>丨歸來的燕子呵，是不是帶陣舊地的輕風。</p>
<p>休要再回憶逝去薔薇色的夢，</p>
<p>丨流浪了幾度了呢！</p>
<p>故地的月色依稀朦朧……』</p>
<p>心兒眞彷彿靜靜的漪波，白鷗掠過，又蕩漾起一絲水影。</p>
<p>遼遠的湖畔，有着年輕的日本姑娘走過，飄飄的衣襟，在風影裏是那麽輕逸的呵！</p>
<p>默默地：茵子倚在我的懷裏。訴說着流浪的悲哀，游子的情緒是那麽地凄傷啊！</p>
<p>茵子的髮絲上繫着白色的花，一陣香味在風裏飄着。</p>
<p>三年的光陰是逝去了。</p>
<p>如今，琵琶湖舊影依稀，但是，三年來的生活只是泥水樣流，茵子的音信却是没有了呵</p>
<p>流浪人的心却是掀着更深的創痛。丨人生原是一個夢，默默地，蒙特靈的絃上彈起凄傷的音波，唱吧，已逝人靑春只有在回憶的影裏作爲舊時夢吧丨丨</p>
<p>『休要再回憶逝去薔薇色的夢，</p>

<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>一個個人頭一樣的西瓜，一擔擔送到享福的人家。把西瓜凍在冰箱的底下，電扇的風好像冷北風刮。汗滴滴的侍女捧出西瓜，殺西瓜總比殺人頭好殺。老爺太太小姐少爺齊來，大家喫着西瓜靠着沙發。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ，</p>
<p>倘若西瓜也有一個嘴巴，他可說出許多訴苦的話：『鄕村給我生命，都市把我壓榨。給我生命的，一年年不知道出過了多少血汗；把我壓榨的，大熱天我看他一顆汗珠也不掛。我們一個個的好像人頭，殺我們的比殺人頭可怕』</p>
<h3 id="c266">我來自東（六） <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>女人大部分會騎野馬，男人大部分都知道用手槍。他們比東部的美國人，比較直爽些，富有革命性些，喜冒險愛反抗。當印第安人被消滅以後，他們便用克復異族的方法，來克復自然的壓迫鐵路造成了；礦石開闢了；運河，水堰，馬路，地下的運油管，都是很快的出現在這不毛的地帶。而在這一帶所看見的建設事業，如胡佛大水電堰，如邊界水堰等，最可以表示美國民族生機力的蓬蓬勃勃。</p>
<p>汽車愈開，近了落機山，田野的沙漠性，也愈加利害。山坡是黃色的灰土堆積成，每當疾風過時，黃沙從山上重重的飛下。空氣是那樣的乾燥，我彷彿在埃及的金字塔下面旅行。太平洋的濕風，因爲被山脈擋住，不能吹到這裏；而此地離開墨西哥灣，距離很遠。沙磧堆中雖然也有幾片農田，但只能種着大麥與黑麥。墨西哥人戴着闊邊的草帽，穿着大脚管的騎馬褲，時常在荒野中出現。他們還保存着些古西班牙騎士的風度和紅印第安人的血統遺傳。粗粗而黑的臉上，配着硬而且黑的鬍子，很得意的唱着墨西哥的情歌。美國西南數省，原是從墨西哥人乎裏奪過來的；所以在落機山西南部，還住着不少的墨西哥人民。</p>
<p>落機山雖然高大，牠的風景，却遠不及我們浙東的雁蕩山·山的東麓，非常簡單平直，松樹像電燈柱一樣的排着，没有什麽曲折，有幾個很很的山尖，還帶着白雪，好像白帽子。山下雖有很大的溪流，但是沿途我還没有看見一條美麗的瀑布。汽車在山頂轉了幾個鐘頭，慢慢地送我到落機山的西麓去了。這邊的空氣，非常澄鮮，在這五月的天氣裏，綠色的叢林，遮住了山上的一切。汽車路綫，灣灣地從綠陰中穿過，路旁隱隱的看見紅色的小屋子，那大半是富人的避暑山莊。在近鹹湖城（Salt　Lake　City）十哩以内，一切景物，都含有清新的詩意。一大羣綿羊，沿着山麓，迎着汽車慢慢而來；汽車夫也只得停車，讓羊兒在車旁挨挨擦擦地擠過去。當夕陽已照滿羣山的時候，山中的櫻桃樹，樹下的小湖，和湖面游泳的白鵝，輝映成趣。鹹湖城便在羣山中建着。街道很清潔，而廣闊。建築物的新潔而整齊，是我在美國很鮮看到的。僅在幾十年以前，鹹湖城一帶，還是一片被黃沙堆積着的，爲紅印第安人所馳騁着的荒野。以後摩門敎的敎主，帶着一些不怕吃苦的男女們，推着笨而且重的牛車，度過落機山而來。他們受過旱災，蝗災；他們和勇悍的異族作戰，與殘酷的大自然壓迫力作戰。他們開始建設灌漑的系統，把無數荒漠化爲良田美土。現在摩門敎的敎堂裏面，還陳列着許多先民的遺物，和開闢時的一切圖畫。你假使去參觀，他們會仔細招待及指導你們的。</p>
<p>此地住着許多日本的移民，有許多在美國生長的日本人，差不多已被美國同化，因爲他們不知寫日本字講日本話了。街上開着許多日本的菜館，裏面食品的價錢，總是非常便宜的。當地的美國人，一方面討厭這些東方矮子，同時也很害怕他們。他們比起中國的僑民，能自覺得多了。他們知道團結，知道如何保全國家的體面。在我所住鹹湖飯店裏，老板問我是日本那一帶的人；當他們知道我是中國人以後，他便很和氣的給我忠告，說在這一帶地方，你最好稱自已爲日本人。『中國人』三個字對於美國人腦筋起什麽感覺，也可想而知了。</p>

<h3 id="c290">職業同盟與職業請願 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>北平畢業大學生最近有職業同盟之組織。其目的爲向社會要求職業。同時並派人入京、向中央作職業請願。這可謂是最近社會上的一椿新鮮事件。</p>
<p>大學生的無出路，不止最近爲然，而以最近爲甚。從前大學生畢業後，大部尙可得到一些職業，雖不一定是好職業，而且大都是學非所用，用非所學，但總算是得到職業了。而最近則不然。大學生畢業後，似乎總以失業爲原則。故有人云，畢業卽失業，實非無故。由此說來，則大學畢業生之出路，比前更困難萬倍了。北平畢業大學生的有職業同盟的組織，並且進一步而向中央作職業請願，這不是没有由來的。</p>
<p>大學生無出路，這可見得中國經濟的凋敝，目前已至如何程度。這目前萬分凋零的中國經濟現狀，才是使得一般畢業學生都感到没有出路的痛苦的。社會經濟衰落日甚，百業蕭條，各處都用不進新的人材，而且連舊有人材，還要常被踢出，一般新進大學生，自然更無出路了。這才是大學生一般感到没有出路的原因。社會經濟常此衰落下去，將來畢業學生，將愈感無出路之痛苦，到那時恐怕不獨有學生職業同盟之出現，恐將還有更大規模的全國靑年失業組織發生。然而社會經濟一日不起色，這些組織和這些要求，還是没有辦法的。</p>
<p>從畢業大學生的没有出路，我們可以看到中國整個民族的危機，已是高漲到什麽程度了。農村破產，民族工業倒毁凈盡，所剩着的，祇是全國饑寒呌苦的民衆。這是一個怎樣可痛可怕的現狀。大學生的無出路，在整個社會問題中看來，還不過是其小焉者也，其他目前更嚴重的問題，如國民經濟之總崩潰等，其嚴重尙有更十百倍於此者。大學生的無出路，不過其表面事件之一端而已。然而單這小問題，已足够使我們聞之而寒心、其他更嚴重的問題，我們將以怎樣更可寒心的態度去對付他們呢？</p>
<p>從大學畢業生的無出路，又使我們連想到今年大學生投考數大爲减少的問题。據調查，今年各大學招考學生投考數，比前幾年大爲减少。這不是没有原因。國民經濟的總崩潰，連學生入學人數也大爲减少了。這眞是一個可怕的現象。到將來，我看全國所有能力進得學校的，將剩不多幾個。大學更不必說了。一向主張敎育救國的人們，對此將有什麽辦法呢？</p>

<p>清晨起來，太陽已晒得小河浜裏的臭水吐着氣泡了火車也像落了魂樣，拖長了步音慢呑呑的走，『嗚』地一聲呌了，四喜子拉了金菓子的手從枕木上跳開，裝冰的草篼拍打着他的屁股，妹妹老實把指頭銜在嘴裏哭。</p>
<p>『　你媽媽的，小鬼頭』。管鐵門的旗手揮着綠旗很親暱的駡着。『哭你娘格屄，火車怕輾不死你這兩個小雜種』『』</p>
<p>！</p>
<p>四喜子假裝没有聽見，從他面前走過，火車呌着『快點！快點』更追過了他們。狗保把冰籃戴在頭上，從岔路裏跑來，輕輕地打金菓子一記耳光。她故意的放聲大哭，拉着哥哥的手站立着不肯走。</p>
<p>『妹妹，走呀！不要管那狗的。』四喜子說。</p>
<p>『四喜子我本來要告訴你一件事情，你徧是瞧不起人』。狗保把雙手叉在腰上，一對眼晴睜得特别地又圓又大。</p>
<p>『狗嘴裏那來象牙，老子不要聽』！四喜子拉着妹妹的小手急急地走。</p>
<p>『幹什麽，你總是駡我』？狗保追了上去問。</p>
<p>『老子駡了你？』四喜子笑着說：『仔細想想你底名字。你狗生的，老子倒把你抬舉了。』</p>
<p>『不要開玩笑』。狗保也笑了。說：『四喜子，我昨天遇見你底娘呀！嗳喲，穿得眞漂亮。哈哈！』</p>
<p>『在什麽地方』？四喜子不由自主地停下脚步問了·！自從爸爸死後，不久娘就跟人逃了，瞎子奶奶那一天不要詈駡幾遍，纔肯帶金菓子去討錢呢？早前四喜子同小兄弟們在拉圾箱裏拾荒，天氣太熱了瞎子奶奶已經晒出病來，睡在家裏走不動，四喜子一行小鬼頭却趁這時候都賣冰了。生意到還不差，只是金菓子太小了跑不得，而且一想起娘又總哭哭啼啼地·四喜子一聽心都碎了。一遇到背影像娘的，他總帶了妹妹喊着冰追了上去。</p>
<p>『在堂子裏呀！狗保閃着狡滑的眼』</p>
<p>睛說。</p>
<p>『堂子是那兒？』金菓子天眞的張大了眼問。</p>
<p>『走喲，妹妹！』四喜子說着，并且把一個瘦小的黑色的拳頭在狗保底流着黃油的臉上㨪了兩榥，怒狠狠地說：『你敢尋老子開心，你認得這個麽？』</p>
<p>『規規矩矩，四喜子，我和你講老實話』。狗保再追上去誠懇的說：『小三子聽說，小屋子也要來賣冰哪。他連山門都不肯來朝一朝，我們大家楱這小舅子。』</p>
<p>『規矩是你興的嗎？』四喜子越加忿怒的說。</p>
<p>『你硬要和我們反起幹嗎！』狗保也怒了。</p>
<p>『反起幹就反起幹，諒你也咬不斷老子的雞巴。』四喜子怒得連頸子都紅了。</p>
<p>『好的，你記着，揍你這小舅子的！』狗保說着跑到前面，走了很遠還毒狠狠的掉回頭來看他們·</p>
<p>『快點，快點呀』！招弟在麥根路車站追上了他們。她底黃頭髮披在肩上，灰白的短衣在風裏飄，褲子上破了好幾個窟窿，下面露出一雙細長的光腿·『喂，四喜子，太陽眞好，現在就晒得皮子痛呀，快點走吧，金菓子，好妹妹，時候不早了咧。』</p>
<p>你爲什麽也遲了呢？四喜子問·</p>
<p>『啊，倒霉，倒霉。我從小屋子家走過，他的娘快要蹺辫子了，躺在地下呻吟，要水喝呀！小屋子不知道到那兒玩去了，我只好替她澆了兩碗。』</p>
<p>『她喫過藥没有？』四喜子說：『我爸爸就爲没藥喫。』</p>
<p>『她也没喫呢，時疫醫院的醫生呌她買，她没錢！』</p>

<p>— 古月</p>
<p>丹溪，一個又平靜又可愛的邨子，邨前汨汨地流着燦爛的丹溪，邨後隱隱地靠着黃兗山，那座山一路圍過來，抱住丹溪的西頭，像一個很可親的慈母。當每個夏天的黃昏，關不住的笑語聲，從邨子偸偸地跑出來，驕傲地附和着丹溪的歌聲。</p>
<p>美呀！我相信，在這個世界上，除着那最甜蜜的少女外，没有能比得上她！</p>
<p>誰又能料到呢？最近一年來，丹溪是遭刦了！被毁壞得不成樣子，邨裏的人都漸漸地遷到别處去，邨裏所留下的祇是死去了一般的寂寞：丹溪是遭刦了！這是社會的罪惡！</p>
<p>遭刦的情形說來是很普徧的任便那個農邨裏都是在這般地閙着，顯然的，唯一的原因，便是農邨經濟破產的應有現象。</p>
<p>當一個很有生氣的早晨，突然地傳來了這末一個恐怖的消息：住在西陽山裏的外來居民，因爲受不過飢餓的逼迫，决定在當天下午大隊人馬開發到山外來搶稻，所謂搶稻者，並不是專要你的榖，就是同强盜搶一般，不過名義好聽一點罷了！</p>
<p>整個的丹溪也被捲入了恐怖的黑幕裏。在那没一些保衛團的鄕邨裏，誰都覺到，這搶刦是件很容易的事；邨裏的人們知道祗有自已的力才靠得住，於是由邨裏的領袖人物，發了一個命令，每人保護各人的家，没有男子的人家，由他較近的親戚保護；有槍的拿槍出來，有刀的拿刀出來，來救濟這生死關頭。</p>
<p>於是整個的上午都耗費在準備裏，女人和小孩都躱在屋裏不准出來，因爲根本没處可逃避。</p>
<p>時問終以是到了，前方的探了跑得滿頭是汗地來報告說：</p>
<p>『他媽的！人眞不少！男人在前面打先鋒，女人在中間，小孩子跟在後面；男人專管搶刦，都帶着刀槍；女人專管抄家，都帶着繩子菜刀；小孩子專管拿東西跑，都帶着繩子扁担；男人女人小孩子，一直從西陽山裏聯到山外的石板路上，人眞不少呀！』</p>
<p>邨長們開了一個臨時緊急會議，議决堅守石板橋頭，祗要不放先鋒衝進，一切都容易解决了。</p>
<p>一面走，一面喊着壯威，强盜的大隊漸漸地走近了石板橋頭。</p>
<p>『給他們一個下馬跪！』守橋頭的人丁朝天放了二槍，</p>
<p>『别怕！衝上去！我們是將要餓死的人還怕什麽？』先鋒鼓着勇氣一口氣衝了過來。</p>
<p>你想，以五枝槍而想抵抗那末許多的人，怎能抵抗呢？所以，終以他們衝進了第一道防綫。</p>
<p>第一道防綫的人丁退到第二道防綫，聯合着邨裏的人，想作一次而戰，可是，他們勢如破竹，不到一刻，他們衝進了邨門口。</p>
<p>邨長没法，祗得高聲呌道：</p>
<p>『諸位弟兄們，你們到底要什麽？』</p>
<p>『我們没飯吃！』</p>
<p>『那末，讓我們邨裏退出，讓你們吃一飽吧！好？』</p>
<p>『那也可以！我們本來不想傷人的！』</p>
<p>結果，除了打頭二陣的人丁，人是没受傷，可是家是被抄得精光，損失不計其數！</p>
<p>丹溪的居民，受了這重大的搶刦，</p>
<p>都狼狽地搬到别處去尋他們的出路，除着幾個做走狗的窮光蛋。</p>
<p>那可愛的丹溪，留下的祗是荒凉寂寞，可是丹溪仍是汨汨地流着，黃兗山仍是隱隱地圍着。</p>

<p>— 敏健</p>
<p>太陽像紅透了的蘋果似的，收歛了他日間的光芒，像害羞的新娘一般，慢慢的把四周的白雲拉過來，掩住牠整個的面孔。</p>
<p>這時，大地上的景物，都顯得十分迷離和岑寂，籠罩了一層灰色的面紗，天空中有時飛過一兩隻暮鴉的呌聲，但是反而點綴了這初秋的寂寞。</p>
<p>一會兒，天空裏又熱閙了起來，星星像爭妍似的閃動着牠們的光輝，但是誰也不願意發出一點兒響聲，只靜靜的躺在寂黑的天空裏。</p>
<p>微風從湖面上掠過來，引得草蟲們都『喞喞』的呌起來。我癡望着不言不語的星星，沉醉在初秋的懷抱裏。</p>
<p>「呵！好一個夜的初秋，」我是這樣說着，頗動了歸心；</p>
<p>「我五年前手植在院子裏的白楊，現在該是巍峨的大樹了。那檐前「喃呢」呌着的燕子，這時想已飛到南方去了。還有，扁豆棚下的蟋蟀們；牠們是被妹妹喚作音樂隊的，現在該在那裏奏着牠們神秘的曲子了………………」故鄕的景物，都像影戲一般的，一幕幕的浮上了腦海。</p>
<p>夜是靜的，詩意的；</p>
<p>竹林裏透出了幾聲凄寂的簫聲，蘆筆裏現出了兩三點漁火「欵乃」的打漿聲，霎然驚醒了，沉醉在回憶中的我，我無聊地望着這忽明忽隱的漁燈，再也續不上這方才的回憶。</p>
<p>漁舟遠了，燈光没了，「欵乃」的聲音，也不再響了，四周的景色，好像是消失了。留住的，祗有我這顆寂寞的心吧了。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我現在有一件關於上海數十萬產婦安危的問題請敎，敬請撥冗公開賜敎，感同身受！</p>
<p>上海有一個Ｋ產科醫院，總分院約有六七處，接生的女醫生，不下二十人，規模不能算小，接生費特别低廉，因此時能迎合中下級的人家的需要！照該醫院章程上的規定；接生費只收四元；產前診察，產後治療，不論次數，完全免費。可是事實却完全相反，該院有一個最大的不應該，就是上海一般民衆所指摘的『瞎打針』！不管產婦有没有需要，總是慫恿產婦打針，針費原本往往只需數角，而索價每針多至五元六元八元不等，所以該院是無形中發了財！而貧窮的產婦有危險應該打針的時候，却因爲針費太貴，無力負担，只好束手待斃，舉起例子來，眞是一天也說不完，該院還有兩個缺點：（一）接產生年齡及經騐均極幼稚，接產時隨意談笑，態度玩忽，（二）設備及照顧不周，看護每日到一次或兩次，對嬰兒不負責：被褥不加消毒，一房數產婦合用一普通之馬桶，所以產婦，容易傳染惡疾！我有一位親眷王女士，家境不大好，去月初住在該院生產，幾天後得病，後來轉送西門某醫院治療，無效而死，還有一位親眷張女士，前月底在該院生產，單打針一項，費去二十餘元，一週後也得病，後轉送海格路某醫院治療，住院三星期，用費達五十餘金，幸慶更生。現在我那兩位親眷，預備聯合起來要求該院賠償損失，但是我的意思，是要他們法律解决，以便切實取締。</p>
<p>編者先生：你以爲這兩件事，應該私了好，還是官休好？假如進行訴訟需要何種手續？除了西門海格路兩大醫院的醫生診斷書做物證外，還需要其他的人證否？以上問題務請先生賜答，感激的眞不止我一個人呢！祇請</p>
<p>文安！　章清鳳啟七月十二日</p>
<p>答：你的來信，揭示出上海滑頭產科醫院在生意上的種種黑幕，誠是一件關係上海數十萬產婦安危的嚴重問題。編者除對於這種專以歛錢爲目的，不管人家性命的庸醫表示十分痛恨外，而於你的兩位親戚缺乏了解上海黑幕的知識，祇知貪圖便宜，以致耗財喪身，尤爲惋惜。進一層說，上海管理衛生事務的執政當局，對於這種設備不週，管理不善的醫院，未能加以取締和監督，致無數生靈，遭受損失，亦覺應負相當責任。此項問題，在歐美各國，非常重視，因非特與人民之利益相關，抑亦與國家之富强有密切關係。以三百五十萬人口衆多之上海，公立市立之醫院僅僅數處，如何足供市民之需要？雖有私立醫院有補助，然設備完善的莫不價値奇昻，祇有少數達官貴人大賈巨富，才可享受，窮措大仍只能向隅，由於這種環境的需要，一般以廉價爲號召的滑頭醫院自然應運而生了。它們初則以最低價格，引入入够，再則以生意手腕，欺人打針。本來生產這件事情非常緊要，生命在於頃刻之間，壯健少婦，因生產關係，能於一時三刻，消滅她的生命，是常有的事情。所以在那種情形之下，生產者祇希望能安全渡過難關，大小平安，受他們的種種敲詐，亦不與計較。這些醫院曁以賺錢爲目的，祇知圖利，人家的生命財帛，那裏還會管到。基於這種執政當局之旣未能廣設公立醫院，又未能嚴厲監督考核私立醫院醫師的原因，遂造成這樣嚴重的問題。以人口如此衆多的地方，生產率一定很高，在你這封信未提出之前，已不知有多少產婦死於這種庸醫之手了（舊式的產婆當更不堪論）苟一思之，誠不禁令人毛骨悚然！</p>
<p>你所說的該院的缺點，根據上述原因，當非偶然，至於令親之死亡和幾頻危險，過失是否完全應請醫院負責，這當然需視該院在業務上有無過失而斷定，但你們旣有兩家醫院的診斷書做證明，已可構成訴訟的進行，至於進行訴訟，還需要何種手續，最好與律師商洽，較爲妥當，此外呈請市政府公部局嚴加取締，亦是一個正當辦法，可雙方並進，至於私了你旣認爲這是一件關係上海數十萬產婦安危的問題，當然不必再說並且你卽與他私了，想他未必賣你賬呢！</p>

<p>和約簽字了。</p>
<p>聖誔節來近了，兵士該要遣散了。威特倫市的靑年們，有幾個已經回來，但是斯託揚却不在其中。的確的，没有他的消息。存娜媽媽漸漸不安起來，痛苦的思想襲擊着她。</p>
<p>日子一天一天地過去：她時常走到門口來。不是有人在敲門麽？朗魁爾。斯託印諾夫已經回來了：其次是丁柯夫的兒子，其次是斯塔馬托夫兄弟。她尋到他們，訊問他們，但他們什麽也不曉得。在某一個時期之前，他們全都看見斯託揚，可是其後他們又都没有見着他。</p>
<p>「媽媽，狄米特留斯回來了，」她的女兒琪娜在她回家的時候對着她呌。於是她又走出來看狄米特留斯。</p>
<p>「好啊，狄米特留斯。斯託揚停在那里？」</p>
<p>狄米特留斯也是一點都不曉得。「也許，」他安慰着說，「他們送他過了威定，他要從另外一條路上回來。」</p>
<p>「聖母啊，我的孩子倒底在那里？」她喃喃地說。</p>
<p>「她走到斯託揚加的家裏。在門口她的心臓跳動得很劇烈。她猜想，無疑地，斯託揚加會告訴她關於斯託揚的消息，他傳來了他的問候：而且在聖誕節前可以到家。但是事實上，斯託揚加没有答話：她只沈默着，兩隻眼睛濕潤潤的。</p>
<p>整個的村市騷然了。他們是在等候從前綫歸來的第一次聯隊從此經過。正好在存娜媽媽的門口，他們種下了兩棵樹，樹枝緊擊在中間形成一個拱門。發　甜味的松樹枝，是從山上帶來的，用以妝飾這樹和拱門，而且上邊張着一個個字牌，那是遠遠地從巴扎吉克運來的，字牌上寫着：「歡迎我們的勇敢的戰士！」在字牌周圍，有無數保加利亞的三色旗，那是一座眞正的凱旋門。</p>
<p>那勝利的軍隊按時地到了而且過去了。</p>
<p>「也許他遲一點回來；他决不會在異域中度過聖誕節的。後邊還有迷路者一個隨着一個地來。到傍晚還有無數的時光。他曉得這里有無數不安的心在等候着他。」</p>
<p>那個可憐的母親這樣地想。</p>

<p>丹楓先生說，「電影所適用的大衆語，乃是「天不下雨，怎麽辦」一種非常明快的語句」。這「明快的語句」，要是說給廣東人聽，卽不翻成廣東話，不也是難懂嗎？丹楓先生雖然說「可以在發音上加重它的地方色彩」，這實在不是語言統一的提倡，而是白話文的提倡。爲了保持地方色彩，在還没有統一的國語的中國，要像一個蘇格蘭鄕下人說英語那樣只有發音的差别，乃是實際上承認方言電影的存在的必要。丹楓先生並且提到他們家鄕的土話不能爲一般人所理解，問題便不能不進到大衆電影。</p>
<p>在現在，電影不是大衆的。現在的電影還在高貴的偉大建築物中給軟性紳士們作爲「眼晴吃的冰淇淋」。藝術是非爲着大衆卽存在不可的。方言電影！戲劇！文學運動不是和大衆電影！戲劇！文學運動分離的。假如丹楓先生家鄕的大衆，過去是看不到電影的，現在適應於他們的需要開始存在了電影，這電影假如不用他們的方言，他們會懂得麽？還是爲了要推行紳商買辦的「國語」統一運動而用「明快的語句」？還是要使大衆理解現實，要組織敎育大衆而用方言呢？我們的答案是肯定後者的。</p>
<p>丹楓先生認爲，大衆語運動，「是使語言文字從白話文中解放出來，使它成爲大衆所易於理解的東西。」所謂「易於」理解的東西」，究竟是什麽東西呢？就丹楓先生所舉「天不下雨，怎麽辦？」的例來看，還是什麽也没有說明。</p>
<p>「天不下雨，怎麽辦？」這是一句白話文，而且在現在電影字幕上很容易看到的白話文。可是在聲片上，這句白話文，而且在現在電影字幕上很容易看過，要是是給廣東觀衆看的聲片，還必須把它譯成了廣東話才容易使他們聽懂，而把這廣東話紀錄下來，當然不會是「天不下雨怎麽辦」這幾個字了。</p>
<p>「大衆語要從白話文解放出來」，我想這並不就是說不要白話文，實際上，丹楓先生所謂「解放出來，使它成爲大衆所易於理解的東西」中的「解放」是很難解釋的。就丹楓先生所舉例看來，大槪就是說，要洗清白話文中的「騾子氣」和「語錄體」，而接受發展它的和大衆接近的一方面。這是對的，可是大衆語建議不止是這一步。並且，這不會和方言的提高衝突。因爲，大衆所最易於聽懂的語言，不是寫在紙上被某些人所認爲經濟的文言，也不是寫在紙上被丹楓先生所認爲明快的「大衆語」，而是他們天天在應用的自已的活的語言。而「現在」大衆語建設，並不是要立刻建設一種全國大衆通用的口語，這是不能在「現在」一蹴而就的，「現在」我們可以做到的是，提高方言的發展，整理「現代中國的普通話」（實際上，廣東話是接納着這種普通話。），而這，就是方言電影！戲劇！文學運動的提倡。「現在」廣大勞苦羣衆是文盲，要建設一種使大衆易於理解，包括寫讀聽在内的大衆語，就必須來一個「把各地大衆的口頭語變成筆頭語的運動」。關於這，我擬在電影字幕問題中再討論。</p>
<p>最後，丹楓先生說，我們智識分子，不肯深入大衆，大衆語建設是不會成功的，我想附加一點，那就是，大衆語建設，不只是我們智識分子的事，而且是大衆自已來幹的事。</p>
<p>話說得太多了，希望各位不客氣的糾正。（完）</p>

<p>一貫的平凡的，三角四角的戀愛糾紛的喜劇影片。</p>
<p>在這裏，没有揭露了社會的眞實的形相，反而，眞實的形相給緋色的戀愛所掩蓋住了。</p>
<p>本來，我們並不是說不能以三角四角的戀愛爲題材攝製電影，我們可以在三角四角的男女戀愛糾紛中，反映出社會的眞實的動亂的面目來。</p>
<p>但是，在一般的，平凡的美國戀愛喜劇片裏，我們能够找到些社會的眞實嗎？</p>
<p>記得去年太光明開映的希茀萊主演的「瀟湘夜深時」，雖是用粉紅色的戀愛的糾紛爲主題，但是劇作者也不能不接觸到了社會裏的眞實而些微的提到了貧窮的父母的不能不把自已的兒子送掉的情狀。</p>
<p>但是，就連這些微看到社會眞實的劇作者也很少有，一般，劇作者不但不去看到社會的眞實，他們還企圖用粉紅色的夢來掩蓋住眞實。</p>
<p>「春色惱人」也並不和一般平凡的美國的戀愛喜劇片有什麽兩樣。</p>
<p>縱少導演在這裏獲得了部分的成功，但是愈因了他的部分的成功的力量，而愈掩蓋住了眞實。而且有些地方是過火了的，如享利脫去大禮服，披上棉被等。</p>
<p>演員以夏托克羅淦爲最佳，南賽卡洛也很不差。</p>
<h3 id="c300">漁光曲&lt;賣座的原因 <a href="#c300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— 勞蓀</p>
<p>在以前，無論中外影片，能够在一家戲院連續開映到十天以上的，已經是很難得了，所以「都會的早晨」，在北京連映十八天的時候，大家都很以爲奇。但是，自從「姊妹花」在新光連映兩月後，又造或了一個新的紀錄，但它的公映，怡巧在廢曆新年，得到所謂「天時」上的帮助，却也不少，現在「漁光曲」一片，能够在這盛暑中，連映一月有餘，並且聽說還要繼續下去，這更不能不說是中國影壇上一個奇蹟吧。現在，我且來談一談該片能够賣座的原因：</p>
<p>通常有這樣兩句俗語，說是「做戲的瘋子，看戲是癡子。」這兩句話的確是很對的，並且一方面瘋的越是利害，一方面癡的越是認眞。就拿「漁光曲」來說，在開映的時候，你如果雜在人叢中，稍稍注意一下，就會聽見許多哀憐聲，從觀衆的口裏發出來，這就是他們被劇中人惑動的一種表示，所以，故事的哀感和演出的有眞實性，就是「漁光曲」能够賣座的一個最大原因，</p>
<p>第二層，一個戲劇的故事，第一要有通欲性。換句話說，就是要使得人人都能瞭解故事的内容，絲毫不感覺有生硬的地方。譬如我們就拿外國片來說，像「女性」「魔俠吉訶德」一類的片子，反不如一般普通影片的能够受人歡迎，没有别的緣故，就是因爲前者意義較深，非一班普通觀衆所能瞭解，再就「人生」和「漁光曲」兩個片子來說，如果從藝術的立塲去觀衆，都是國產片中的優秀作品，但是因爲「人生」的意義較深，在商業上的收穫，終於讓「漁光曲」估了優勝了。</p>
<p>我們再把「漁光曲」的編輯手法來檢討一下。除掉有一兩個鏡頭略嫌冗長外，它是自始至終，一氣呵成。每一個畫面都是有力的，每一段情節都是刺激的。並且越到後面，越來得緊張，把觀衆的心靈，緊緊抓住不放。這一層，確是値得讚美的。</p>
<p>再還有一層，就是「漁光曲」的成功，所得到音的帮助的力量是很大的。如：唱奏漁光曲的哀怨聲；狂風大浪的怒吼聲等。如果「漁光曲」不是配音的話，也許感人之深，不會有這樣利害吧！</p>

<p>一個人有一個人思想的發展。每個演員有每個演員的個性，這是不可移動的。固然，一個演員專長一種以上的「持長」是有的，然而終不能找出一個萬能的「明星來」！</p>
<p>在中國可就不然，往往見一個明星在甲片裏飾「悲角」，在乙片飾「笑角」，在丙片裏又飾起「武俠人物」了，試問如此無目的所追求，他們怎能有藝術的深造？難道畢眞如廣告上所云：「萬能……嗎？」</p>
<p>好萊塢的麗琳甘許，以善演悲劇而著名。希佛來以嬉皮笑臉而著名。他們是永遠地追求着自已性格之所近，而非朝三暮四者可比。但，有時我們在廣告上可以見到他們「改變作風」的措辭。但，這須要認清的他們所以「改變作風」者，以自已對本來的所長發現不滿。或感覺得「深造」之困難，所以，才有「改變作風」的這一來，並非喜歡飾什麽角色，便扮什麽角色也。</p>

<p>戀愛，本來是很神聖的；但是現在都市中，常有一班靑年男女，把戀愛當作一種買賣式的貨品。甚至還　許多人，都以爲結婚是戀愛的墳墓，奉行男女相戀而不結樆的邪說，這是很可歎的，今天在國泰開映的「市愛」Sally　Bishop一片，取材於名小說家Temple　Thurstun的名著，就是旨在揭穿這種畸形戀愛之秘密的。全片充滿着諷刺的情調，幽默的風味，諧趣的表演，熱烈的情感。女主角瓊白蘭，不但是容貎秀麗，而表情的細膩，亦極可觀，其他男女配角，亦均稱職。</p>

<p>麗蓮從喬治的懷抱裏，溜了出來，走到對面的鏡子前頭。她突然間又跳了起來喊道：「那個傢伙又將我的化妝盒子藏起來了！」她在那面鏡子前面站了半天。她自已覺得自已實在美麗，眼皮半閉着，口微張着，顯着嬌羞無那的神氣，正像未嫁的新娘，被人攙扶到神壇前的光景。她覺得這種表情太好了，不要白白地空費了。她掉轉身來，羞人答答地對着喬治道：「喬治，爲什麽你總没有向我求過婚呢？」喬治覺得奇怪道：「我從來没有想到過，你會對於那個感覺得興趣的」。麗蓮嘆了一口氣道：唉，喬治，你對眞正的麗蓮加蘭，實在知道得太少了！祇知道她是個女伶，但是我對於戲院，已感覺到厭倦，我不是活着的。我是在表演着的……恐怕我到將死的時候，還不相信是眞的死哩。哦，我已經死過無數次，發生過戀愛無數次，我已弄不清什麽是眞的，什麽是假的了。」喬治走到她面前，低聲問她道：「你說到底什麽是眞的呢？」麗蓮眨着眼睛，將眼淚眨乾了，然後很莊重地說道：「一所房子，一個家，樓上有一個小兒間，裏面擺在幾個裝餅乾的瓶子，樓梯上有小兒的脚聲走上走下……」</p>
<p>麗蓮剛說到那裏，她聽到她背後的門開了。她的心房勃勃的跳了起來，連呼吸都要停止了，因爲她掉轉身一看，她看見歐斯卡·吉甫正趦趄不前地站在門口。他的手有木架子架着，那係他在最後一分鐘内想到的，他因此而非常欣賞自已的聰明的。没有女人，尤其不是麗蓮，他想，可以看見了他那種受傷吃痛苦的神情，而不生憐惜之心的。但是他還無法裝出悲哀的樣子，因爲他已得到了一個　人的奇遇……那個奇遇足可以使他歡呼雀躍。起首是兩個有鬍子的人，來到吉甫的包房裏來尋他。他們是一個「熱情劇團」的重要份子。他們亦因爲在詩家谷失敗了，而逃亡出來的。他們看見了吉甫，就將他們的經過和他講了。吉甫因此得了一個啟示……他可以演「熱情劇」而使麗蓮扮演劇中美達琳！還有無巧不成書的是，一位百萬富翁，克拉克先生，他是一位帶着很深的宗敎思想的工業家，他自告奮勇地願以財力相助。那位富翁說，他將不惜鉅資，竭力相助，他並且給了他一張大大的支票，他說那還不過是第一張支票哩！</p>
<p>吉甫是深知麗蓮脾氣的。他不敢將這許多好消息顯露在他的臉上。他臉上所有的，是一些痛苦的痕跡，他所要竭力隱瞞的。他開口了。他說：「麗蓮，我過來看看你，和你說聲「哈囉」。他的聲音是極端低柔的。但是麗蓮的聲音，是很緊張的。她說：「歐斯卡，我不願意和你說話。請你去吧！我没有什麽話可以同你說的！你有什麽話說，我亦没有功夫來聽」！喬治聽了，站了起來。他怒斥着吉甫道：「我警告你。你小心些。不要來和加蘭小姐瞎　。我說什麽是什麽。滾出去！」吉甫又驚恐，又羞慚。他對着麗蓮道：「麗蓮，你呌他摔我出去好了。這眞是無奇不有的事哩。我的來此，還是寛宏大量，不計已往……特來向你祝賀你的成功的哩。」（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) In the Beiping war zone negotiations, Yin Tong, dispatched by Huang Fu, represented the Chinese side at the Sino-Japanese representative conference in Dalian. The Japanese participants were Kita Seiichi, a Kwantung Army staff colonel and chief representative of the Tanggu Truce Agreement, Okamura Yasuji, adjutant to the Kwantung Army, and Shibayama, a military attaché from the Japanese embassy. A preliminary exchange of views was held on the evening of the 23rd, and formal meetings began on the 24th. The content of the consultations included the Kwantung Army's withdrawal from the Great Wall line in accordance with the Tanggu Truce Agreement, security issues in the war zone, A: the number of security teams to be organized by the Hebei Provincial Government to take over defense, and the determination of weapons to be carried; B: the reorganization and handling of the old troops of Zhao Lei, Liu Zuozhou, and Hu Xie Wu; C: the banning of Japanese and Korean vagrants selling narcotics, setting up gambling dens, and other illegal activities. The results of the consultations were telegraphed to Huang for instructions at any time. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At the Dalian meeting, it was reported that Okamura revealed to Yin Tong the intention to solve the issues of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China and joint Sino-Japanese railway transport, among others. (24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Okamura arrived in Dalian by plane this morning, accompanied by three staff members, from Changchun to meet with Yin Tong. The Dalian meeting was held at the Taihe Hotel on the Xinggepu coast. Yin Tong resided there. (Special dispatch on the 24th) (Beiping) After arriving in Dalian, Yin Tong met with Japanese military attaché Shibayama, Kwantung Army representative Miyazaki, and many others. It is reported that Yin and others began discussing various issues in the war zone today, adopting a purely conversational approach to avoid formal meetings. During the negotiations, only our side raised the issue of the security team entering the war zone, the withdrawal of Japanese troops from various passes of the Great Wall, the receiving of Malanyu, and the crackdown on Japanese and Korean vagrants causing trouble in the war zone. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain foreigner received a telegram from Dalian stating that Yin Tong arrived in Dalian on the evening of the 23rd, and Shibayama and several others greeted him at the pier. He stayed at the Yamato Hotel. The South Manchuria Railway Company held a banquet for Yin that evening at the Yamato Restaurant, with more than twenty guests and hosts. Yin's room was super-grade, provided by the South Manchuria Railway Company, consisting of a bedroom, a reception room, a bathroom, and a servant's room. The Japanese police station sent four plainclothes detectives to escort him. Yin refused to meet with Chinese and Japanese reporters who came to visit. This morning at ten o'clock, Shibayama, Kita, and Okamura visited Yin at the Yamato Hotel and began secret talks in the reception room. Security was very strict. Japanese police were stationed in Yin's adjacent rooms and corridors, and no idlers were allowed to stay. As of the time of dispatch at noon, the meeting had not yet ended. It is predicted that the meeting will proceed without any major twists and turns. Yin will not stay in Dalian for long and will return to Tianjin from Dalian on the afternoon of the 25th. It is uncertain whether Shibayama will accompany him. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lei Shourong said that he would not participate in the Dalian meeting and had no intention of leaving Beiping recently. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The consultations between Yin Tong and Japanese officials, including Major General Okamura, concluded this afternoon. It is reported that only minor issues in North China were discussed. The issue of abolishing the Tanggu Agreement and the withdrawal of Japanese troops was not raised at all. It was decided to hold long-term consultations in Dalian and Beiping. Chinese and Japanese representatives will also be selected separately. (China United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) After today's consultations, Yin Tong made a statement to the press corps, saying that today was merely a frank exchange of views and that he did not wish to say more. Major General Okamura also made a statement, saying that the issues of abolishing the Tanggu Agreement and the withdrawal of Japanese troops were not discussed. He also said that frequent talks will be held in the future, that Huang Fu had not given any instructions, and that the current consultations had concluded. (China United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) After the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese talks in Dalian, Major General Okamura's statement was as follows: Today's meeting only discussed trivial issues within the Tanggu Truce Agreement area, so it did not involve the abolition of the truce agreement or the withdrawal of Japanese troops. In the future, frequent talks will be held in Beiping, Shanhaiguan, and other places, and the content will only be about trivial issues. In the future, both sides will send committees to conduct technical research. Chairman Huang Fu of Beiping was silent in this meeting. However, the relationship will not stir up sensitive nerves. The statement by Yin Tong, the Chinese representative, was as follows: Only small problems within the truce agreement area were discussed, so the political situation in North China and the abolition of the truce agreement were not mentioned at all. Yin Tong’s purpose for the negotiation has been completed, and he is scheduled to return to China on the Tianjin Maru on the 28th. (Telecommunications dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Dalian conference lasted until 1 p.m. today, lasting three hours. Kwantung Army Deputy Chief of Staff Okamura said the following to reporters after the meeting: Today, Mr. Yin Tong and I frankly exchanged opinions on the various trivial issues arising from the truce agreement. In particular, considerable discussions were held on the maintenance of public order and other technical issues within the truce area. As a result of this meeting, we can meet frequently in the future to organize and solve outstanding issues. As for the abolition of the truce agreement, there is no need to propose it for discussion at this time. Major General Okamura and Colonel Kita returned to Changchun this evening. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Sino-Japanese meeting in Dalian was held at Hoshigaura at 8 p.m. last night due to the arrival of Kwantung Army Staff Officer Colonel Kita. Deputy Chief of Staff Okamura, Colonel Kita, Beiping-based military attaché Lieutenant Colonel Shibayama, and Adjutant Izumi from the Kwantung Army, and Yin Tong from the Chinese side attended. The form of the meeting was not adopted. Everyone wore yukata. After having dinner together, Yin Tong and Deputy Chief Okamura began to exchange opinions. No concrete decisions were made, and the meeting adjourned amidst laughter at 11 p.m. From 10 a.m. on the 24th, concrete issues began to be discussed. (Telecommunications dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Dalian consultations are gradually taking on importance. On the Chinese side, the existence of the truce agreement has put the Huang Fu regime in a difficult situation. At this juncture, in order to restore the normal state of North China as the center, outstanding issues were resolved, so Yin Tong repeatedly prepared to negotiate with military attaché Shibayama, proposing to hold a final meeting in Dalian. However, from the Japanese side's point of view, if the Chinese side does not have a political agreement to replace the overall abolition of the truce agreement, it will absolutely oppose the abolition of the agreement. Therefore, there is not much expectation for the Dalian consultations. Also, if the Chinese side does not have major proposals, today's talks can be generally regarded as over. (Electric Communications dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The second Sino-Japanese meeting was held at "Riga" at 9:30 a.m. today. Those attending on the Japanese side were Major General Okamura, Colonel Kita, and Lieutenant Colonel Shibayama. Yin Tong was on the Chinese side. Secret talks were held in a room on the second floor. However, due to the strong attitude of the Kwantung Army, the prospect of the talks on the issue of abolishing the truce agreement was already pessimistic. (Electric Communications dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Today is the second day of the Sino-Japanese talks in Dalian. Both sides had repeated earnest discussions on various issues within the truce agreement area, but did not involve the most important issue of the abolition of the truce agreement. Therefore, the issue of withdrawing Japanese troops was not mentioned. The negotiations seemed to have ended very simply. However, in the future, this kind of negotiation will often be held in Beiping, Shanhaiguan, Dalian, etc. Therefore, committees will be sent from both China and Japan. Also, since the negotiations have ended, Major General Okamura is scheduled to return to his post by train on the 28th. (Electric Communications dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) It is confirmed that the Sino-Japanese talks on the night of the 23rd also generally discussed the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Also, Vice President Kuda of the South Manchuria Railway Company, who attended the talks for about an hour, stated the South Manchuria Railway Company's opinions. (Electric Communications dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Central Department's view on the abolition of the truce agreement is as follows: China seems to hope to abolish the truce agreement because the issue of traffic has been resolved, but the reason for the establishment of the agreement is that after the cessation of war, China's attitude towards Japan was the same as it was during the war, and it failed to return to normal, so issues such as postal service and customs were not resolved. Moreover, the current state of all of China, regarding relations with Japan, has deteriorated in essence, so there is no fundamental reason to abolish the agreement. Therefore, the Kwantung Army can hardly accommodate China's hope. Although it is reported that Huang Fu cannot go north, Japan's position is not something that can be changed.

<p>Supplementing the Members of the Henan Provincial Committee and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission</p>
<p>Appointing Tan Guangzhong as a Member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held a temporary meeting on drought relief at 8 a.m. on the 24th to discuss the disaster relief and work-for-relief plans proposed by the provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the municipal governments of Nanjing and Shanghai. Those present were Wang Zhaoming, Luo Wengan, Chen Shaokuan, Huang Shaoxiong, Chen Gongbo, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Chen Shuren, Shi Qingyang, Liu Ruiheng, Xu Mo, Duan Xipeng, Zheng Tianxi, Cao Haosen, Zou Lin, Qin Fen, Zeng Zhongming, Chu Minyi, Peng Xuepei, and more than twenty others. Shen Baixian, Director of the Construction Department of Jiangsu Province, Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, Liu Yiyan, Director of the Construction Department of Anhui Province, Lai Lian, Representative of the Nanjing Municipal Government, Wu Huanru, Representative of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and others were also present. Chairman Wang Zhaoming continued the discussion from the previous meeting on the drought relief measures for the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. It was resolved that:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding disaster relief, each province should continue to investigate the severity of the disaster and the extent of the affected areas and handle them separately.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding agricultural construction, the National Economic Commission should be consulted, and the Ministries of Finance and Industry should review and report by next Tuesday. After the above issues were discussed, the 170th regular meeting of the Executive Yuan was held immediately, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Liu Maoen, a member of the Henan Provincial Government, requested to resign, which was approved, and Zhang Guangyu was appointed as a member of the Henan Provincial Government. (2) Zhang Dulun, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, requested to resign, which was approved, and Zhu Jiqing was appointed as a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. (3) Tan Guangzhong was appointed as a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. (4) The term of the Beiping Municipal Council will expire on August 1 this year and should be adjourned immediately. The election agency should prepare for the election in early August in accordance with the law, hold the election in mid-August, and establish the new council in early November. The meeting adjourned at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>After the adjournment, according to Chu Minyi's statement to the Central News Agency reporter, the disaster relief and work-for-relief plans had been drafted by the three provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two municipal governments of Nanjing and Shanghai. Before this morning's Executive Yuan meeting, representatives from each province and city presented them for discussion. First, each representative reported on the contents of the plan, which mostly focused on tidying up lake ditches and waterways, and constructing warehouses and other agricultural construction projects. As for the required funds, Shanghai Municipality needed 624,000 yuan, Nanjing Municipality had no confirmed figure, Jiangsu Province needed 17 million yuan, Zhejiang Province needed 28 million yuan, and Anhui Province needed 10 million yuan, totaling more than 55 million yuan. Adding the amount needed for Nanjing Municipality, the approximate total would be around 60 million yuan. When the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan discussed the drought relief event last Saturday, it was estimated that 10 million yuan would be required for work-for-relief expenses, which the government would try to undertake, but at that time, there was no concrete plan for how the central government would raise this huge sum. Now that each province and city has prepared the work-for-relief plan, the required expenses have exceeded the originally planned amount by one time, so after consultation, it was decided to hand over the plans submitted by each province and city to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, and request the participation of the National Economic Commission, to review them in detail and report back by next Tuesday, and then submit them for discussion again. The steps for implementation will be determined according to the urgency and importance of the plans. Afterwards, they will be processed in order. The representatives from each province and city who came to Beijing to attend the meeting do not need to come to Beijing to attend the meeting again. After the results have been negotiated, the Executive Yuan will inform each province and city by telegram. In addition, the chairmen of the Chahar and Suiyuan provincial governments also telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request relief due to the floods, which was also brought up for discussion today. It was decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Finance and the Relief Affairs Committee to discuss the relief measures. Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance did not come to Beijing to attend the meeting today because his health had not yet recovered, but he sent a very detailed telegram to the Executive Yuan on the disaster relief, explaining the measures and expenses for drought and flood relief in detail, mainly stating that floods are different from droughts. After floods, people's fields and houses are submerged, and their clothes and belongings are gone. Arrangements must be made for food, clothing, and shelter. After droughts, there is only a lack of food, and there is no problem with housing, clothing, and other things. Therefore, it is only necessary to prepare food to lend to the disaster victims. In short, all relief plans and expenses will be handed over to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the National Economic Commission for detailed review and submitted to next week's Executive Yuan meeting for decision, according to the Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th.</p>

<p>Russian Side Strictly Guards Against Spies Infiltration</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Recently, many military spies dispatched by the Japanese Kwantung Army in the area between Manchuria and Hulunbuir have pretended to be merchants or workers and are trying to infiltrate the Russian border to spy on the secrets of the Soviet Russian border army. As a result, the small station of Shirenli outside Manchuria, which is the Russian cavalry, is patrolling very strictly every day, constantly firing guns to demonstrate, and shelling the puppet state border every one or two days. Although the Japanese side knows this, it pretends not to hear it. The road from Hulunbuir to the Ganjuur Temple in Outer Mongolia is an important road to Russia and Mongolia. Russian planes conduct reconnaissance several times a day to prevent Japanese spies from sneaking in. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The clubs of the East Railway's Harbin-Suihua and Harbin-Manzhouli lines were all sealed up last week by the puppet North Manchuria Special Commissioner's Office in coordination with the puppet special zone police, alleging that there were Soviet Russian road workers inside who were holding secret meetings, promoting communism, and instigating unrest. Harbin's Russian Consul Shirauzy has protested to the puppet negotiator Shi Luben twice, but Shi has strongly refuted both times. The Russian government is paying close attention to this matter. Harbin's White Russian newspapers have fabricated many rumors, causing Japanese-Russian relations to become tense again. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Another Test of the Non-Recognition Doctrine <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>When the puppet state was first established, Xie Jieshi once issued a public announcement to foreign countries, using the opening of the Manchurian door and the fulfillment of international obligations as bait to entice countries to grant it formal recognition. However, all countries, adhering to the spirit of the League of Nations resolutions and the Stimson Doctrine, generally ignored it. The Japanese, although outwardly calm about this international non-recognition doctrine and feigning indifference, actually felt it like a bone stuck in their throat, unable to be removed. Ultimately, they colluded with the small Central American country of El Salvador, hoping to salvage something from the situation. Their painstaking efforts were both pitiful and frightening.</p>
<p>The Japanese, on the one hand, wanted to gain a glimmer of international sympathy, and on the other hand, wanted to ensure the overall control of the puppet Manchuria, which led to contradictions between their words and deeds, and they were unable to resolve the situation themselves. From the establishment of the puppet Manchuria until today, foreigners in Manchuria still enjoy consular jurisdiction, and consuls of countries other than Japan stationed in Manchuria still perform their duties based on the "recognition certificates" issued by the Chairman of the Chinese National Government. At the same time, they continue to be under the control of their embassies in China. These two points are sufficient to demonstrate that the so-called non-recognition doctrine has its positive significance. The reason why Japan and the puppet Manchuria authorities have tacitly acquiesced in the past is that the overall situation was not yet settled, and they did not want to act too hastily.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese are ultimately unwilling to simply ignore this expedient measure. Moreover, with the increasingly tense relations between Japan and Russia and the upcoming London Conference, the uncertain international status of the puppet Manchuria will pose a major hidden danger for the future. Once Japan and Russia go to war, the puppet Manchuria is bound by the "Japan-Manchuria Protocol" and cannot but take the same position as Japan and participate in the war. However, in the eyes of neutral countries, the puppet Manchuria is still Chinese territory. If China does not participate in the war, how can the puppet Manchuria act on its own? If the puppet Manchuria declares itself a belligerent, it will inevitably have the determination to implement international law during wartime. The resulting disputes will be serious. We all know that in the Second Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese will exert the power of their superior navy. However, due to the limitations of naval treaties, they cannot expand it as much as they would like, so they have to borrow the name of the puppet Manchuria navy to build warships. It is expected that during the future Russo-Japanese War, Japanese warships flying the puppet Manchuria flag will appear on the high seas to exercise the right to search neutral ships. However, if neutral countries do not first recognize the puppet Manchuria as a state, not only will it be unable to fulfill its wartime mission, but it will also cause major conflicts with neutral countries and put Japan in a difficult position. Even the interests of foreigners within the puppet Manchuria will be affected by the distinction between the belligerent and neutral status of the local area. If this is not resolved, there will inevitably be many disputes. It can be asserted. Moreover, the Japanese are confident of victory in the war against Russia. According to their prediction, Korea at the end of the First Russo-Japanese War is equivalent to today's puppet Manchuria. The puppet Manchuria at the end of the Second Russo-Japanese War will be like Korea today. If the puppet Manchuria can gain the recognition of various countries as soon as possible, it can merge with Japan at that time and directly copy the story of the annexation of Korea without seeking the understanding of various countries again.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although Japan is building warships by borrowing the name of the puppet Manchuria, it cannot do as it pleases due to the monitoring of countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. If the puppet Manchuria can be recognized by various countries and join the international community, then expanding its navy at any time would be its inherent right, and other countries would not be able to interfere. If that were the case, the Japanese could have already secured victory without waiting for the negotiations at the London Conference.</p>
<p>However, the powers have long understood the Japanese mentality, and the non-recognition doctrine is perhaps even more in the actual interests of countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia than it is in China. Therefore, even without the constraints of the League of Nations resolutions and the Stimson Declaration, they would certainly not abandon it rashly. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 19th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to revise the principle of equal opportunity for opening the Manchurian door as a prelude to forced recognition. Recently, the Kwantung Army Headquarters has also demanded the prohibition of the movement of British troops within the Shanhaiguan area, causing embarrassment to the countries that signed the Boxer Protocol. Their intention is nothing more than to make various countries feel the practical difficulties. Even if they cannot actively recognize "Manchukuo" as an independent country, they should at least tacitly acknowledge "Manchukuo" as not being Chinese territory. It is still difficult to predict how these two matters will change. However, the non-recognition doctrine will face another serious test, which is beyond doubt. Will countries other than the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia be able to maintain their original position, or will they succumb to Japanese threats?</p>

It is now learned that these proposed amendments were only mentioned in person by Chen Guangfu during two visits with Kong Xiangxi. Contrary to rumors that the Banking Association had submitted a written request for amendments, the Ministry of Finance has not received any such document. The Ministry of Finance still believes that there is no need to amend these provisions, as the careful drafting of the Savings Bank Law is precisely to ensure the safety of depositors. The state, in order to encourage savings, must strive for sound safeguards for savings. Moreover, the drafting of this savings law was studied very thoroughly, and there is really no need to amend it. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>The Remaining Twenty-Three Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>Allegedly Plotted to Sabotage Russian Rear During Wartime</p>
<p>(Moscow) During the Soviet Russian Supreme Court Military Collegium's trial of arrested spies, the activities of a major espionage organization were uncovered, with particular emphasis on the Soviet Russian Far Eastern Railway transportation. The leader of the organization was Korean Kim Jae-won (transliteration). It was heard that his party members had received special training in tasks such as destroying roads, preparing to hinder the Russian army's rear during wartime. It was also heard that the organization had secured responsible positions for its members in the railway, so its sabotage work sometimes resulted in deaths and injuries to many people. All twenty-three of those being interrogated were sentenced. Their leader, Kim Jae-won, and others have been sentenced to death by firing squad today. The rest were sentenced to imprisonment for up to ten years. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, under the direction of Uliech, has completed its trial of a spy and sabotage ring operating in several parts of the Soviet railway system.</p>
<p>During the trial, it was revealed that the mission of the ring was to collect information on railway carrying capacity and mobilization preparations (especially regarding railways connecting central USSR and the Far East) as well as the condition of locomotive repairs throughout the Soviet Union (especially the main lines in the Far East). At the same time, they conducted sabotage work on the railway and in locomotive repair shops and made various preparations for large-scale sabotage work in the event of war.</p>
<p>The organization included Soviet state employees who betrayed the interests of their country, including officials of the central apparatus of the Transport Commission and officials of its local apparatus. The leader of the ring was an espionage and sabotage agent, Kim Ruoyin (transliteration), a Korean from Manchuria and an agent of a foreign secret organization. These traitors received rewards from Kim, conducted large-scale reconnaissance activities, collected secret materials, and sought to damage vehicles, destroy railway factories, and damage machinery in locomotive repair shops, in order to carry out various sabotage activities on the railway. These acts of sabotage include the train wreck at the Zhuo'erna'ye station on the Moscow-Kazan railway, where two locomotives derailed, fifteen trains were destroyed, and many people were killed and injured, resulting in the interruption of traffic on the main line. Other incidents include the collision of two freight trains at Panji station and the destruction of a suburban passenger train outside Udel'naya station. The machinery and lathes of the Molom locomotive repair shop were systematically damaged under the instructions of Yalamashantrovski and Sveridov. In short, these traitors who betrayed their country have caused significant damage to Soviet railway transportation.</p>
<p>A total of twenty-three people were interrogated by the Military Collegium. Considering that the personnel of this spy and sabotage group were engaged in destroying one of the most important sectors of the national economy, namely railway transportation, and that all members of the group were Soviet employees, they committed a direct crime against the motherland. In addition, all leaders and organizers of espionage and sabotage activities, as well as the most active spies, must be subjected to the death penalty. Therefore, the leader of the ring, the Korean Kim Ruoyin, and his closest aides, namely Slasedning, an expert in the locomotive department of the Transport Commission, Aleksandrov, Koshlov, Mishin, and Sveridov, the director of the technical department of the Molom locomotive repair shop, Porovski, the stationmaster of the Moscow-Pasachi'erskaya station on the Moscow-Kazan railway, and the locomotive engineer Mozhainov, were sentenced to death by firing squad for being the organizers of espionage and sabotage activities and the most active spies and saboteurs.</p>
<p>Other defendants, including Rodonov, an expert in the locomotive department of the Transport Commission, Seredenski, the chief of the first section of the Moscow-Kazan railway, and other individuals, were sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or less. (TASS dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>US Plans to Establish New Naval Base</p>
<p>To Create Grounds for Dealing with Japan's Demand for Equality</p>
<p>(Washington) Several of the new naval bases that the United States plans to establish in the Pacific are, in terms of flight speed, only an arrow's flight away from the Japanese coast. The United States may use them to deal with Japan's demand for naval equality. The Associated Press learned today from reliable sources that someone has informally proposed this plan to the US government in preparation for dealing with Japan's demand for equality. One of the proposed bases is Dutch Harbor in Alaska, only 700 miles from the Asian continent. It is remembered that during the Washington Conference, the United States promised to abandon all naval bases in the Pacific in order to induce Japan to accept the 5:5:3 naval ratio. Therefore, observers believe that if Japan insists on demanding equality, then the United States resuming the establishment of naval bases is also within expectations. They believe that the Navy's dispatch of aircraft and submarines to Dutch Harbor in Alaska, the Army's aircraft flying to Alaska, and the US fleet's planned naval exercises in Alaska next year are all signs of a storm brewing.

<p>Juneau, Alaska Peninsula. Ten US Army bomber aircraft flying from the United States landed at Whitehorse, Yukon, at 6:55 PM yesterday (local time). The aircraft's route involved flying over the Canadian Rocky Mountains, which was one of the most difficult sections, and it has now been successfully completed. It is said that this flight by the US Army aircraft squadron is quite important. Former Army Aviation Commander Mitchell once said that if the United States uses Alaska as an air force base, it will be able to control the whole world. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Contents of the US Air Defense Investigation Report <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(New York) The special committee established by the US Department of War to investigate the US aviation industry released its investigation report today. The report contains some corrections to the theory of sky attacks.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Have No Offensive Capabilities. The report states that there is no need to worry about an attack on the United States from the sky at present, as there are currently no aircraft capable of flying across the Pacific or Atlantic Ocean to attack important central locations in the United States. If an enemy air force wants to attack the United States, it must use warships in the ocean as its base, and these warships must be in locations where the US fleet cannot attack them. Otherwise, it must have the support of the army, and this army must be stationed on or near US territory. For example, last year, Italian Air Minister Balbo's aircraft squadron flew across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States, stopping in eight locations on foreign territory and eleven locations on ocean warships. The preparation period, from the beginning of preparation to the arrival at the destination, lasted a total of thirty-three days.</p>
<p>Establish Base in Alaska. The report advocates that the United States must maintain sufficient air bases, at least one air base must be established in Alaska, as that area is vulnerable to attacks by the Japanese Navy and Air Force. The Aleutian Islands are Militarily Important. Some people believe that if the Aleutian Islands in the Pacific are properly organized, they can be used as a base for effective attacks against Japan.</p>

Please send a letter as soon as possible to Shanghai Post Office Box 1667, as I will be returning to the Philippines in two months. Opposes Merging the Army, Navy, and Air Force. In addition, the US Air Force has always been divided into the Army Air Corps and the Navy Air Corps. Some people have advocated merging them under unified command. The report opposes this proposal, stating that the current Japanese Air Force is also separately commanded by the Army and Navy, which is the same as in the United States.</p>
<p>Suggests Encouraging Private Industry. In addition, the report suggests encouraging commercially run aircraft industries and that state-owned aircraft manufacturing plants should not compete with private factories. Efforts should be made to facilitate the export of aviation equipment, as the reason why US aircraft manufacturing is superior to other countries is that the US aircraft industry is not subject to the control of military agencies.</p>
<p>Purchase More Aircraft and Train Personnel. The report advocates that the government purchase a large number of aircraft and increase funding for training aircraft pilots. The report argues that the United States should have a total of 2,320 aircraft and a corresponding number of pilots. When necessary, aviation personnel should be eliminated and replaced with younger elements. All Army officers should receive thorough aviation training. The report also states that Colonel Lindbergh advocates developing the use of aircraft engines, increasing it from 1,500 horsepower to 2,000 horsepower. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>No Mention of Large Airship Policy. (Washington) The Army Air Corps investigation report of the Joint Military and Civilian Committee was submitted to Secretary of War Dunn yesterday by the chairman of the committee, Pei Kaier. It completely fails to mention the much-disputed issue of large airships, only suggesting that the military continue to test the use of these airships for reconnaissance and other military purposes. The committee has a total of eleven members, six representatives of the people and five military personnel. They generally agreed with the report that the Army Air Corps lagged behind the US Navy and commercial aviation. Du Lie'er, a famous high-speed aviator who was originally a member of the Army Air Corps, added a separate report, strongly advocating that the Air Corps should be separated from the General Staff Headquarters. The general report refers to the idea of merging the air forces of the Army and Navy and establishing a separate aviation department as an extravagant waste that cannot be implemented.

<p>The British Air Force Should Be Equal in Strength to That Across the Channel</p>
<p>Policy Perspective Aims at Peace, Not Aggression</p>
<p>(London) Since Acting Prime Minister Baldwin presented the British plan to increase air force armaments over five years in the House of Commons last Friday, the question of expanding the air force has become the main goal of debate in the House of Commons. The Labor opposition members of the House of Commons have already proposed a motion, stating that it is regrettable that the British cabinet has decided to increase armaments after discussions between Britain and France have just concluded at the disarmament conference. Therefore, this afternoon, Secretary of State for Air, Londonderry, attended the House of Lords to deliver a speech defending the government's five-year air force plan and answering the opposition's questions in the House of Commons. The speech stated briefly: During the Great War, Britain was the world's largest air power, but today it has fallen to fifth place. In 1923, Britain had already established a plan to build 52 squadrons of aircraft, but this plan was delayed due to disarmament negotiations. The government's announced plan to build an air force in 1934 and the four years thereafter is actually just a revival of old matters, in an attempt to remedy Britain's unbearable weakness. Any responsible government that knows it should use all means and all power to seek national security will not allow our country's air force to remain in a small and weak position for long. The government deeply understands that appropriate air defense is necessary for the empire's safety, and therefore, it has decided that the British air force should be on par with the largest air force capable of attacking the British coast. This is the main policy of our national defense. We seek equality in the air force, and there are four ways to achieve this: First, completely abolish naval and army military aircraft. At the same time, we must find ways to ensure that civil aircraft are not used for military purposes. If so, the air forces of all countries will be equal to zero, with no distinction in strength. Second, other countries take the lead in reducing their air forces to be equal to our British level. In other words, all countries reduce their air force strength to the extent agreed upon by all countries. Third, Britain builds an air force to be equal in strength to the largest air force capable of attacking the British coast. Fourth, the second and third methods are implemented simultaneously. On the one hand, countries jointly seek to reduce their air forces, and on the other hand, Britain builds an air force to seek equality. From this perspective, our views are clear and practical. Our country must have an air force that is as strong as the air force of any country capable of attacking the British coast. If so, our power to strive for peace can be enhanced, and it will not be a small contribution to the suppression of the arms race. Britain has always hoped to establish an international agreement to limit air forces, just as it hopes to limit all armaments. However, the air force policy that Britain is now adopting will be able to promote the early establishment of an agreement to limit air forces. This is what I earnestly hope for. Last November, I made a statement to you on this issue. You should still remember that at that time, I said that like a balance scale, one end is the plate of aggression, and the other end is the plate of peace. All of Britain's national power, like a weight, is placed in the plate of peace policy, which is beyond doubt. However, if we now argue that the weight of Britain's sword does not have to exceed the weight of the aggression side, then there is nothing more encouraging to the policy of aggression than this, etc. After Londonderry finished his speech, Labor opposition member Lord Ponsonby was about to stand up to reply when suddenly a loud noise was heard from the roof, and a fighter plane was soaring over the parliament building. It turned out that Britain was conducting air defense exercises from today until Friday, with the aim of determining whether, if foreign aircraft attacked from the south, they could cause damage to London. After a while, Ponsonby spoke, first saying that the government's proposed policy of air force equality would actually lead to an air force arms race among countries, and that the Secretary of State for Air had just finished his speech when a fighter plane flew over the parliament building roof, which was such a coincidence, what else could this be but an omen. Finally, he said that the Labor Party supports the Geneva policy and advocates joint action by all countries to safeguard peace and punish aggressors, and that this position will never change. After Ponsonby finished his speech, the House of Lords held a vote, and the government's air force policy was passed by a large majority of 54 votes to 9. (Havas Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to Secretary of State for Air Lord Londonderry, who told the House of Lords today, the procedure for Britain to expand its air force will cost a total of 20 million pounds by 1938. This procedure aims to reverse the arms race. In the future, when it is completed, the position of the Royal Air Force will not reach equality unless Britain continues to build, and it will be easy to continue the expansion and achieve rapid success. However, he hopes that this situation can be avoided through international agreements. According to the Secretary of State for Air's remarks, this was in response to Labor MP Lord Ponsonby's motion expressing regret over the increase in armaments before the end of the disarmament conference.

<p>Searchlights Illuminate the Dark Night, More Than 300 Aircraft Participate</p>
<p>(London) Last night, aircraft circled over London and searchlights flashed. The British Air Force held a military exercise, with 200 bombers attacking London. This aerial exercise will continue until Friday. Its purpose is to test the efficiency of the British Air Force. The Air Force is divided into two teams: the attackers are the Northern Army and the defenders are the Southern Army. The Southern Army has 180 aircraft, all of which are fighters and reconnaissance aircraft, assisted by searchlight teams. The attacking army began its attack last night, with the sound of engines rumbling all night. They competed to drop bombs on London. The defenders used 150 searchlights to detect the location of the attacking army and intercepted them with fighter aircraft. According to the opinions of those in London who are paying attention to this matter, many of the attacking aircraft penetrated the defense line and dropped bombs on their targets. However, the referees have not yet announced their decision. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>Rome The Italian aviation magazine "Aviation Life" published a long article criticizing the effectiveness of battleships in naval warfare. According to the recent decision of the Italian government to build two 35,000-ton battleships, this article is probably referring to this matter. The article briefly stated that area-type warships are extremely vulnerable to aircraft attacks en route before they reach the battlefield, especially in relatively narrow oceans such as the Mediterranean. The use of air power is far above that of the navy. Therefore, although the government's decision to build two battleships is necessary, its role is not of great importance. For the victory of future wars, battleships can only fulfill a secondary task. (Havas Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Can Be Seen in the Trial of the British Man</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to a report from the Finnish capital published in Izvestia, during the trial of the British man Brown (i.e., the person who previously attempted to harm the staff of the Soviet embassy in Finland), the court showed a hostile anti-Soviet tendency. This tendency is consistent with Finland's general hostile attitude toward the Soviet Union. The aforementioned attitude is based on a systematic propaganda of anti-Soviet actions, with the aim of occupying the Soviet territory inhabited by its "close relatives." This hostile policy has also been noticed recently in the two major international issues of the Eastern Locarno Pact and the relationship between the Soviet Union and the League of Nations. The report claims that, in general, the current Finnish government cannot and is unwilling to establish genuinely peaceful and good-neighborly relations with the Soviet Union. Under this political background, Brown's trial is another example of Finland's attitude toward the Soviet Union and can confirm the above characteristics. (TASS Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Negotiations to Be Held in Washington Today</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull announced today that negotiations on Soviet Russia's debt to the U.S. will begin on Wednesday at the State Department. Both diplomatic and financial circles are paying close attention to this announcement, saying that discussions may eliminate a layer of obstacles to U.S.-Russian trade. Because the Department of Justice has listed Soviet Russia as a debtor nation under the Johnson Act, it cannot raise new debts in the U.S. again. The debt being discussed this time totals US$768,500,000, which is the debt issued during the Tsarist and Kerensky governments and not recognized by the Worker-Peasant Government. In addition, there is also the property of American people that was confiscated by the Soviet Russian government when it nationalized all property, valued at US$440,000,000. For 16 years, the U.S. government has insisted that this loss must be compensated before recognizing Soviet Russia. Even at the time of recognition last year, it was stipulated that negotiations must be conducted to resolve the issue. Russia believes that this debt was borrowed by the previous government to oppress the people, so it refuses to pay it. Later, Russia also demanded compensation for the occupation of Siberia and other places by the Allied forces, and was willing to convert the old debt into new debt, so the prospect of negotiations appeared. Although the amount demanded by Soviet Russia from the U.S. has not been mentioned, it was initially claimed that the total amount demanded from various countries reached a huge US$600 million. Now that other countries have repeatedly found solutions with Soviet Russia, the U.S. should also be able to use indirect compensation methods as the basis for discussion.

<p>Vienna It is rumored that the Austrian Socialist Party is receiving assistance from the German National Socialist Party and intends to deliver a fatal blow to the Austrian government. The Austrian government is now acting quickly to save its life. Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss yesterday issued a stern order to arrest suspected criminals, as a conspiracy to overthrow the government has been discovered. In the evening, more than a thousand socialists were arrested. Vienna's prisons were suddenly overcrowded, so it was necessary to establish additional detention centers. When Dollfuss meets Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Riccione at the end of this week, it is expected that Dollfuss will speak about Germany's continued assistance to terrorist acts in Austrian territory. It is likely that Dollfuss will make the same statement to the League of Nations. When the Socialist Party members were arrested yesterday, everything was kept extremely secret. It is only known that the Socialist Party members were arrested because they were suspected of close cooperation with the National Socialist Party. Those arrested today may be tried by military law. It is likely that many will lose their lives for participating in the conspiracy. The atmosphere in Austria is tense, even more so than before. Bombings have occurred frequently. According to the Deputy Minister of Public Security, the instigators are Communist Party members and Socialist Party members. They are acting on the orders and money of the National Socialist Party organization. The Austrian government recently announced that anyone who privately possesses explosives will be severely punished or sentenced to death. After this order was announced, the public turned in a total of 235 cases of explosives, weighing 212 pounds, including 1,150 bombs. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>

Reports from Krakow and other Galician cities also state that the disaster is widespread and deep. There have also been reports of wind and lightning disasters in northern Italy. Milan was plunged into darkness for several hours due to a power outage caused by the storm.

<h3 id="e54">London Copper Prices Plunge <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(London) Copper prices plummeted today. While surplus metal reserves had decreased slightly in the first half of the year, metal prices remained weak. Now, copper prices have fallen sharply again. This is partly due to the poor situation in Germany, which has reduced its raw material imports to the lowest possible level. As a result, American metal merchants are dumping their surplus production on the London market at reduced prices. Furthermore, the mines in the Belgian Congo in Central Africa are becoming serious competitors. They can still make a profit even selling at the current low prices. Their aim is to sell goods, with maintaining prices as a secondary concern. Unless American commerce revives in the autumn, easing the pressure of American copper in London, and European purchasing power increases slightly, the current situation is unlikely to improve.

<h3 id="e98">Development of Japanese-Dutch Commercial Conference (Batavia Correspondence) <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Disputes arise over exchanged goods</p>
<p>Third meeting has a breakthrough</p>
<p>Decision made to form a separate expert committee for discussion</p>
<p>Since Japan, with its low labor costs and convenient transportation, implemented a policy of dumping in Southeast Asia, the market in the Dutch East Indies has been almost entirely monopolized. Not only has the sales of goods from European countries been greatly affected, but the market for products from the Netherlands itself is also in danger of being completely seized, posing a great threat to agriculture and industry in the Dutch East Indies. For example, Java has had abundant harvests for many years, with ample food supply. If the import of cheap Japanese rice is allowed to continue freely, local rice prices will inevitably plummet, severely impacting the livelihood of farmers. If the indigenous people take actions beyond the law due to their inability to maintain their lives, the impact on public order will be significant. Therefore, in order to maintain public order and protect local agricultural products, the Dutch East Indies government had no choice but to promulgate regulations restricting the import of foreign rice. Similarly, cheap Japanese cement almost defeated cement from Padang. To protect its own industry, the Dutch East Indies also had to restrict the import of Japanese goods. Furthermore, the "sarong" (a type of skirt worn by indigenous men and women) industry was originally the most important indigenous industry in the Dutch East Indies, but due to the dumping of Japanese goods over the years, the sarong industry of the indigenous people has been greatly affected, almost to the point of complete bankruptcy. Moreover, the "sarongs" imported from the Netherlands have also been gradually decreasing due to the exclusion of Japanese goods. If this is not remedied soon, sales will inevitably be completely blocked. Therefore, in order to protect indigenous industry and promote the sales of products from the Netherlands, regulations restricting the import of textiles could not but be promulgated.</p>
<p>After the Dutch East Indies successively promulgated various restrictive regulations, Japan was greatly alarmed, as it realized that the hard-won good market would soon be lost as a result. Therefore, it had no choice but to find ways to salvage the situation, and proposed to the Netherlands to open a "Japanese-Dutch Commercial Conference," hoping to imitate the precedent of the Japanese-Indian conference, and use the method of dividing the Indian market with Britain to divide the East Indian market with the Netherlands. However, the Japanese-Indian agreement was able to be established because Indian cotton was needed by Japan, and textiles were also needed by India. Therefore, both sides were happy to accept the exchange of cotton for textiles. But the situation in the Dutch East Indies was different, as it had no goods that Japan needed. The Dutch East Indies' largest exports were sugar, tin, copra, rubber, tobacco, coffee, and kerosene. Among them, the sales of sugar were the worst. If Japan wanted to reach an agreement with the Dutch East Indies to exchange goods, the Dutch East Indies was very willing to exchange sugar for Japanese goods. However, Japan absolutely did not need sugar from the Dutch East Indies, because sugar from Taiwan was not only sufficient for Japan's use, but it was also planning to expand into the world market. Therefore, Japan only wanted to buy more of the Dutch East Indies' rubber, tobacco, coffee, and kerosene. The Dutch East Indies insisted that sugar must be exchanged. Disputes arose between the two sides as a result.</p>
<p>The Japanese-Dutch conference was originally scheduled to be held in May, but it did not begin until the end of June. As of the 27th of last month, representatives from both sides had held three meetings. During the first and second meetings, the representatives from both sides held their own views, resulting in nothing but heated debates. Japan's reason was that the recent actions of the Dutch East Indies, restricting the import of Japanese goods, violated the "most favored nation" clause in the "Japanese-Dutch Treaty of Commerce and Navigation," and its attitude was very strong. The Dutch side's attitude was also very strong, stating that "in view of the fierce competition of Japanese goods in the Dutch East Indies market, the Dutch East Indies government, in order to stabilize the economic and social life of the country and to prevent abnormal disturbances in the economic situation of the Dutch East Indies, had to adopt this new measure based on the country's absolute freedom of action." With both sides insisting on their own positions, it was extremely difficult to be optimistic about the future. However, during the third meeting on June 27, the two sides suddenly decided to organize an expert committee to invite experts to collect various reports and then conduct detailed discussions. Although it is still difficult to predict the outcome of the discussions at this time, it cannot be said that this move is not a major turning point in the overall situation. From the reporter's observation, it is expected that the Dutch side will inevitably make considerable concessions in the end, as it is difficult to achieve the goal of insisting on exchanging sugar for textiles with Japan.

<h3 id="e99">Record of Inspection Along the Songhua River <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>River Waters Swell, Japanese and Puppet Armies Lose Their Power</p>
<p>Rural Areas Bankrupt, Commerce Declines, Righteous Armies Active</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: In mid-June, a reporter disguised himself and traveled by boat from Harbin along the Songhua River to the Fujin area for inspection. In the area along the river, the activities of the righteous armies were most prevalent in counties such as Xindian, Tonghe, and Huachuan. As a result, ships dared not dock and stay. Each river vessel on the voyage was mostly escorted by ships from the puppet Songhua River Defense Fleet to provide protection. The ship taken this time was protected by the warships Jiangqing and Jiangping, fore and aft. Investigations along the river revealed that the righteous armies near Huachuan were the most determined in resisting Japan. They repeatedly attacked Japanese and puppet troops and even sent letters inviting the warships to battle. The Japanese and puppet troops were unable to deal with them due to their unpredictable movements. In Tonghe, the atmosphere was tense. The puppet Songhua River Defense Fleet's "Enmin" and "Pumin" ships are currently defending the area. Xindian is a vital waterway to Bin County. When the righteous army leader Zhao Shangzhi and his troops launched a fierce attack on Bin County, they also planned to seize Xindian first to cut off the enemy forces coming to the rescue from Harbin. The puppet Songhua River Defense Fleet then dispatched the "Datong" and "Limin" ships to be stationed in Xindian for a long time to guard Bin County. Since then, due to the soaring river waters, many farmlands have been flooded. Farmers, distressed by the Japanese monopoly after a bumper harvest last year, suffered a sharp drop in grain prices, resulting in rotten grain in their warehouses. Further economic pressure left them unable to save themselves from poverty. They did not consider the flood a hardship. Moreover, with the river water too high, low-lying areas became swamps. The Japanese and puppet armies lost their power. Therefore, many farmers voluntarily joined the righteous army, carrying guns. This kind of action was entirely motivated by the phenomenon of national and familial ruin. If we can take advantage of the situation and make this national spirit endure forever in the Northeast, it can also help recover lost territory. The larger docks along the coast are Fujin, Jiamusi, Huachuan, and Sanxing. In the Huachuan area, the righteous armies are very active, and the Japanese and puppet troops come to search from time to time. Therefore, families with a little wealth have mostly moved to Jiamusi. The losses can be imagined. Japanese and puppet troops are stationed in Fujin, Jiamusi, Sanxing, and other docks, with strict precautions. However, various places mainly rely on agricultural production. This year, because of cheap grain hurting farmers, the rural economy has gone bankrupt. Farmers' purchasing power has declined, and commerce has declined accordingly. Merchants are unable to stock goods. Each purchase is only enough to last for a dozen days of sales. The internal fatigue is evident. The shipping industry is also far inferior to what it used to be. The number of passengers traveling up and down is few and far between. Except for recruiting workers in various places, hardly anyone goes there. Because grain prices are too low, grain merchants cannot make a profit and do not load and transport it, resulting in ships having no goods to transport. The Japanese-puppet joint Songhua River Shipping United Bureau has no solution and can only transport fuel needed for winter and the present on the return trip to provide relief. However, some ships still need to be suspended to maintain the status quo. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e101">Chairman Chiang Explains the Meaning of Wuyuan's Reassignment <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Political, Military, and Highway Conveniences are All Greatly Enhanced</p>
<p>Requesting Exemption from Reassignment Shows Narrow-Mindedness and a Lack of Understanding</p>
<p>Order to the Wuyuan County Government to Conduct Extensive Propaganda and Guidance</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang's headquarters, in order to facilitate military, political, and highway matters in Anhui's Wuyuan County, which protrudes into Jiangxi Province, has decided to place it under the jurisdiction of Jiangxi, and has filed a record with the Executive Yuan, ordering the governments of Jiangxi and Anhui provinces to send personnel to hand over the area. It is now learned that the various Wuyuan fellow-countrymen's associations abroad have sent letters to the headquarters requesting exemption from reassignment. After receiving the letters, the headquarters, after examining the reasons for the request, found them to be based on narrow-minded views and a lack of deep understanding of the purpose of the reassignment. It has specifically ordered the Wuyuan County government to explain the various points in the order and to provide detailed guidance. The original order is as follows:</p>
<p>"It has been found that the case of the reassignment of the county to Jiangxi Province has already been ordered by this headquarters to the governments of Jiangxi and Anhui provinces to hand over the area and establish boundary markers separately, and a letter has been sent to the Executive Yuan to order the responsible departments to record the case in the files. Subsequently, the Ziyang Academy of the county, as well as the Wuyuan fellow-countrymen's associations in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuxi, and Xiuning, have successively sent letters and telegrams requesting exemption from reassignment. After examining the reasons given, they are based on narrow-minded views and a lack of deep understanding of the purpose of the reassignment. The following is a specific explanation:</p>
<h3 id="e102">Reasons for the Necessary Reassignment <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The most important reasons why Wuyuan must be reassigned are approximately three: (A) Politically, it has been found that Wuyuan was established as a county during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty and belonged to She Prefecture of Jiangnan Dao. During the Song Dynasty, it was proposed to reassign it to Jiangxi Province because the rivers south of the county all flowed into Jiangxi, using Maoling and Xinling as boundaries. Now, observing its terrain, most of it protrudes into Jiangxi Province and is surrounded by the three counties of Fuliang, Leping, and Dexing. It feels very isolated from Anhui Province, and all administrative facilities are inconvenient. If it is not reassigned, it will be restricted by the current situation and unable to expand its political power. (B) Militarily, at a time when the work of suppressing bandits is particularly tense, eliminating remnant bandits is an urgent task. Wuyuan and the three counties of Fuliang, Leping, and Dexing are geographically intertwined. Due to their belonging to two different provinces, all necessary measures to eliminate remnant bandits, such as the defense of local militias and encirclement plans, are greatly separated, giving the Red bandits opportunities to flee and prolong their survival. Once reassigned, authority will belong to one province, responsibility will be focused, and command will be more convenient. The extermination of the remaining bandits can be expected in the near future. (C) In terms of highways, the Wubai and Wude roads, one from Wuyuan through Jiudu of Dexing to Baishaguan, and the other from Wuyuan to Tuntan of Dexing, are closely related to bandit suppression, military affairs, and local transportation. If Wuyuan is not assigned to Jiangxi, the two roads will belong to two provinces, and transportation management will be difficult to coordinate. At this time when the bandit crisis has not yet been resolved, we must not allow any slackness that could delay the opportunity. All three of these points are extremely clear. The order from this headquarters to reassign the county is truly in accordance with the principles of adapting to local conditions and adapting to the situation, and is carefully considered and truly in line with the requirements.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Refuting Opposing Reasons <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The reasons given by the various Wuyuan groups for opposing the reassignment are far-fetched in both theory and fact and have been refuted separately. The main points are as follows: (A) Different Customs: The main point is that although Wuyuan is adjacent to Leping and Dexing in Jiangxi, its customs are very different. If reassignment is carried out, there will be many problems with administrative facilities. It is found that China's transportation is not yet developed, so there is inevitably a phenomenon of "no communication within a hundred miles." Wuyuan protrudes into the three counties of Delefu in Jiangxi. The customs of the border areas should not be very different. Anhui Province has more than 60 counties, and the language and customs of Wuyuan, except for the two or three counties of Xiu and She in its vicinity, are not the same as those of other counties. Even in the old Huizhou Prefecture, which belongs to six counties, I am afraid there will be conflicts. This cannot be a reason. (B) Economic Reality: Regarding political groups, organizations, and economic foundations, the main point is that Wuyuan used to belong to Huizhou, and many people from Huizhou do business abroad, especially from Wuyuan. Huizhou merchants in various ports have guild organizations and public funds, which are difficult to analyze. A sudden split would cause great losses and many disputes. Tens of thousands of Wuyuan overseas Chinese have no group protection and will inevitably be isolated, or even lose their jobs, causing great panic in the region. Moreover, the economic foundation of the Wuyuan people is built on commerce, which is the same as other counties in Huizhou, which is different from the counties in eastern Jiangxi, where the land is balanced and the soil is fertile, and the economic foundation of the people is built on agriculture. If they are combined, the lives of the Wuyuan people may be shaken. It is found that administrative divisions and the organizational structure of people's groups in various counties are two completely different things. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the old Huizhou Prefecture system has been abolished. More than 20 years have passed since then. The guilds and public funds in the six counties of Huizhou still exist, and there has been no analysis or disputes. This reassignment to Jiangxi Province is nothing more than a change in the administrative region of the province. The people of the six counties of Huizhou can still maintain their past organizations in fact, and the law does not force their separation. With the same economic foundation, the people of county A and county B can each engage in different occupations without affecting each other. Even within the same county, the people who engage in agriculture, industry, and commerce each have their own freedom of will and environment. A cannot force B to engage in the same occupation, let alone between counties. (C) Cultural Issues: The main point is that the cultural spirit of Anhui and the organizations of overseas Chinese groups all take Zhu Xi as their model. Wuyuan is the hometown of Zhu Xi, and the remnants of his style have not yet been extinguished. Huizhou's view of Wuyuan is like Donglu's view of Qufu and Southern Guangdong's view of Zhongshan. In recent years, it has been on the verge of bandit areas and has not been reduced to banditry, which is also due to this. Once reassigned, it will not only eliminate the cultural reputation of Anhui Province in history, but also shake the spiritual and material basis of the entire Anhui group at home and abroad. Moreover, the people in Leping, Dexing, and Fuliang in Jiangxi are mostly strong and brave in private fights, seeking revenge, and the law can hardly stop them. If Wuyuan is assigned to Jiangxi, I am afraid that it will not be able to withstand the deterioration. It is found that Zhu Xi is a famous Confucian scholar in our country, and his teachings have been spread widely and far. People in the country are proud of the sages, and no matter which province they belong to, they can admire and inherit them, and carry forward their legacy. There is no need to embrace feudal ideas and forcibly divide the boundaries, and occupy the sages for the private possession of an area. Our people's psychology of worshiping sages lies in admiring their great personality and good words and deeds. Goodness in the world is one. When Wuyuan belongs to Anhui, the people of Anhui can worship Zhu Xi, and they cannot prevent people from outside Anhui from worshiping Zhu Xi, and it will not add to the cultural reputation of Anhui Province. When Wuyuan belongs to Jiangxi, the people of Anhui can still worship Zhu Xi, and the people of Jiangxi cannot prevent the people of Anhui from worshiping Zhu Xi, and it will not damage the cultural reputation of Anhui Province. Anhui and Jiangxi both belong to the territory of China. Why should we have tribal views and fight over stories? As for the worry of being deteriorated after the reassignment, this is absolutely impossible. Whether Wuyuan's education is better than Dexing, Leping, and Fuliang is still to be investigated in fact. Assuming that it is better, then the knowledge of the people of Wuyuan must be higher than that of the neighboring counties. What deterioration can be worried about? (D) Historical Relationship: The main point is that political facilities must focus on historical relationships. Wuyuan was established from the Tang Dynasty to the Five Dynasties and belonged to She Prefecture. In the Song Dynasty, it belonged to Huizhou Xin'an Prefecture. In the Yuan Dynasty, it belonged to Huizhou Road. In the Ming Dynasty, it belonged to Huizhou Prefecture. Until the Qing Dynasty, Wuyuan always belonged to the Huizhou region and belonged to the jurisdiction of Anhui without any changes. The history is deep, and the administration is convenient day by day. A sudden change will cause many separations. It is found that political facilities should focus on historical relationships. However, measuring the situation, considering the gains and losses, to adapt to the needs of the facts is also a necessary action in administration. How can there be no changing laws in the world, and there is absolutely no permanent rule to stick to? Wuyuan's reassignment has its own factual needs. It cannot be based on historical evolution and ignore reality. Since the founding of the Republic of China, there have been many changes in provincial administrative regions. The largest ones are the establishment of provinces in Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Chuanbian, and the establishment of municipalities in Nanjing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Beiping. If it is beneficial to the country, we should actively improve it and not allow ourselves to stick to the old and follow the routine and stick to the status quo. All four of these are the reasons for their inappropriateness, so I will give them detailed guidance, so that the people of the county can understand the purpose of this headquarters to reorganize the administrative divisions.</p>
<p>To sum up the two sections above, it is clear that Wuyuan's reassignment is indeed adapting to the needs, and the requesting documents are actually mostly empty and superficial. The true meaning is revealed by mutual elucidation. Moreover, the Executive Yuan has already replied to the record, which is even more firm and unwavering. Therefore, the county government is ordered to know and inform, and to extensively publicize the various sections in the order and provide detailed guidance, so that all know where the general meaning lies, and there must be no prejudice. Even in the future, when the two provinces cooperate fully, there will still be no boundaries between them. The chairman, Chiang Kai-shek, (23rd Datong News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e104">He and Xu Return to Hankou from Xunyang <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Visited Chiang in Lushan to Discuss Bandit Suppression Plans</p>
<p>He Will Go to Northern Hubei in a Few Days, Xu Returns to Western Hubei</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Pacification Director stationed in Hubei, He Chengjun, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Hubei-Hunan Border Area, Xu Yuanquan, previously went to Xunyang on the 10th to attend a bandit suppression conference to be convened by Chairman Chiang in Lushan. Zhang Xueliang, the Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression in the three provinces, also went by plane on the 15th. He and Xu visited Chiang several times in Lushan to discuss the bandit suppression plans in western and northern Hubei. They went down the mountain together on the 22nd and took the Ruihe ship westward from Xunyang, arriving in Hankou at 1:00 p.m. on the 23rd. According to (1) He, this trip to Guling was to visit Chairman Chiang to report on the inspection of western and northern Hubei and to ask for instructions on future clean-up and rehabilitation measures. Chairman Chiang gave very detailed instructions and especially instructed to actively develop highways and facilitate transportation. The Jiangxi bandits have suffered heavy losses after repeated attacks and suppression. He Yunqiao has contacted the Guangdong and Guangxi sides to prepare to mobilize a pincer attack, which can be dispatched at any time. The long encirclement has been completed, and the bandit disaster can be eliminated. The bandit suppression military affairs in Sichuan Province have also been successful. The defenses on the border between Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi are consolidated and will not allow them to disturb. After Xiao Zhichu's troops take over the defense of Yunyang, I will still go to northern Hubei for inspection. Deputy Commander Zhang and General Commander Liu Xueya met in Lushan. Zhang still needs to stay for a while to discuss with Chiang. Liu is suffering from a minor illness and is recuperating. Chiang attaches great importance to the floods and droughts in Hubei Province and is discussing relief measures. (2) Xu said that he visited Chiang to report on the clean-up of scattered bandits in northwestern Hubei and the prevention of the remnant bandits of Xu and He, and to present a report on the rehabilitation and the construction of highways, which was well received. The mountain roads in western Hubei are rugged and inconvenient for military transportation. In the past, remnant bandits harassed the area, which was probably the reason. Now that the scattered bandits have been cleared and Xu and He have fled far away, it is appropriate to develop transportation in time and strengthen the arrangements. The road line from Shinan to Badong is the most important. If this road is completed, it will be like increasing the bandit suppression force by several times. It is planned to consult with Chairman Zhang Yuejun in Hankou to proceed, and then return to Shashi for defense. The regimental and battalion commanders and chiefs of staff of the second term of the 41st and 48th divisions of the 10th Army, led by Zhang Zhenhan, commander of the 41st division, arrived in Hankou and will go to Xunyang for training in a few days.

(2) The chairman reported that after the end of this committee, it was decided to organize the North China Agricultural Cooperation Enterprise Committee to promote cooperative enterprises for farmers in North China. All members of the committee are appointed. Those who have been appointed are Zhang Boling, Zhuang Menglin, Tao Menghe, Zhou Yichun, Shi Jinghuan, Qin Dechun, Xia Qingyi, Zhou Zuomin, and Zhang Yuanshan. It is planned that Zhang Boling will be the chairman. The founding meeting will be held at the Political Consolidation Council next Monday at 4:00 p.m. (3) The continued work of labor relief will be transferred to the Hebei Provincial Government. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. After the meeting, telegrams were sent to the Executive Yuan and the Political Consolidation Council, and letters were sent to various agencies, reporting on the closing process. In addition, in the name of Vice Chairman Yu Xuezhong, the committee's establishment process and work situation were published. The original text is as follows: "This committee was established on July 21, 1933. At the same time, the Secretariat was established, focusing on the internal organization. On August 7, the Emergency Relief Group was established. On the 17th, the Finance Group was established. The Agricultural Relief Group began preparations on August 4 and was organized on September 1. This is the situation at the beginning of the operation. On August 17, 1 million yuan was allocated by the Ministry of Finance. On January 17, 1934, 2 million yuan was collected from the public debt mortgage. Donations from all parties continued to be received, totaling more than 140,000 yuan. This is the income situation. When the 1 million yuan allocated by the Ministry of Finance was received, it was decided to give priority to emergency relief. The emergency relief items were stipulated as three items: cash and food, health care, and labor relief. The investigation of the cash and food item began on August 31. A total of more than 430,000 yuan in cash and more than 30,000 yuan in food were distributed in 22 counties in Hebei, which have all been completed. The health care item began on September 14. A total of 86,700 people were diagnosed and vaccinated in 17 counties, including Luan County in Hebei Province, at a cost of 4,500 yuan, which has long been completed. Under the labor relief item, it was stipulated as three items: river management, road repair, repair of public buildings, and filling in trenches. A total of more than 770,000 yuan was allocated to Hebei and Chahar provinces, which have not yet been completed. At the beginning of the establishment of the Agricultural Relief Group, it was only able to allocate donations from all parties for investigation and preparation. It was not until the public debt mortgage was allocated to the committee that it could be implemented. A total of 3,793 mutual aid societies were established in 24 counties in Hebei and 9 counties in Chahar, with more than 179,000 guarantors and more than 1.419 million yuan in loans, which were all completed by June 15. This is the process. The working period of this committee was originally set for six months, and it could be extended if necessary. As of January 21 this year, the six-month period expired, but the public debt mortgage was just allocated, and the relief work was in progress. Therefore, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved to extend it for two months, until March 21. When the extension expired, the agricultural relief was only extended to Luandong, and the agricultural relief in the counties north of the Great Wall in Chahar was added. When the affairs were busy, the labor relief had to wait for the spring thaw before it could start. It was submitted to the Executive Yuan again to extend it for two months, and when it expired on May 21, most of the emergency relief and agricultural relief had been completed, but there were still problems with a part of the labor relief plan. Moreover, the War Zone Relief Bonds had a face value of 4 million yuan, and the Ministry of Finance limited them to be sold at more than 80% off. At that time, they had not yet been sold. This committee was negotiating back and forth by telegram. If the money was obtained after the sale, the work of this committee would not be over. It was submitted to the Executive Yuan again to extend it for another two months. During these two months, it was decided to change a part of the labor relief plan to the Qinglong Bay, Qilihai, and South New Diversion River projects, which were handled by the Construction Department of the Hebei Provincial Government and the North China Water Conservancy Commission. This committee has already allocated the funds, and it is estimated that it will still take time to complete the project. The banks mortgaging the public debt required the Ministry of Finance to include it in the Public Debt Fund for guarantee before they could negotiate. This committee transferred the negotiation to the Ministry of Finance, but it was not approved. This committee also asked the Ministry of Finance to sell it in Shanghai, but it was not approved. Recently, it was approved by telegram, stating that if your committee has not sold it by the time it expires, it will not be allowed to be sold. This committee has no need to wait any longer. When this committee's closing method was telegraphed to the Executive Yuan, it was approved. It should be closed on time. In addition to compiling and printing this committee's general report, which contains detailed information, and distributing it for inspection, I would like to report on the general outline first."

<h3 id="e106">Abolishing Oppressive Taxes in Fujian Province <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>First Batch of Twenty-Seven Items Abolished</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Department of Finance, in order to comply with the national financial conference's resolution to abolish oppressive taxes and reduce the people's suffering, has specially formulated a provincial tax survey form, ordering all county governments and tax bureaus to fill it out in detail in preparation for exemptions. Now, according to successive reports submitted by various counties, the Fujian Local Economic Research Association established by the department has discussed the matter and decided that the first batch to be abolished includes twenty-seven items: (1) Provincial Ship Tax, annual amount of 200,000 yuan; (2) Minhou Flower Seed Tax, annual amount of 480 yuan; (3) Minhou Chicken, Duck, and Goose Tax, annual amount of 4,000 yuan; (4) Minhou Bean Sprout Tax, annual amount of 48 yuan; (5) Minhou Retail Wine and Food Tax, annual amount of 600 yuan; (6) Minhou Retail Cigarette Tax, annual amount of 480 yuan; (7) Minhou Rickshaw Tax, annual amount of 1,200 yuan; (8) Minhou Vegetable Vendor Tax, annual amount of 360 yuan; (9) Minhou Magnolia Tax, annual amount of 480 yuan; (10) Minhou Paper Umbrella Tax, annual amount of 216 yuan; (11) Minhou Fermented Bean Curd Tax, annual amount of 204 yuan; (12) Minhou Meat Swallow (Wan) Tax, annual amount of 312 yuan; (13) Minhou Paint Tax, annual amount of 144 yuan; (14) Minhou Fresh Fruit Tax, annual amount of 360 yuan; (15) Minhou Ready-Made Clothing Tax, annual amount of 240 yuan; (16) Minhou Milk Tax, annual amount of 240 yuan; (17) Minhou</p>
<p>Potato Tax, annual amount of 360 yuan; (18) Minhou Rattan Ware Tax, annual amount of 120 yuan; (19) Minhou Hair Net Tax, annual amount of 33.6 yuan; (20) Minhou Knitting Tax, annual amount of 93 yuan; (21) Minhou Fake Straw Suitcase Tax, annual amount of 55 yuan; (22) Minhou Gong Tax, annual amount of 72 yuan; (23) Minhou Fake Snow Flake Tax, annual amount of 31.2 yuan; (24) Minhou Bamboo Mat Tax, annual amount of 84 yuan; (25) Minhou Copper Casting Tax, annual amount of 30 yuan; (26) Minhou Bamboo Strip Tax, annual amount of 81.6 yuan; (27) Minhou Brush and Ink Tax, annual amount of 146.4 yuan. The total annual amount of the above twenty-seven items is 210,469.8 yuan, which has been listed and reported to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance for examination and compliance. However, of the above twenty-seven items, only the ship tax is provincial, while the remaining twenty-six items are business taxes collected by the Minhou County Tax Bureau. In addition, there are many other types of oppressive taxes in various counties that are being investigated. As for the land tax surcharge, which is most closely related to the rural economy, there are four types of general surcharges throughout the province: highway, education, autonomy, and group affairs. It is still difficult to ascertain those added separately by each county. The Department of Finance is currently discussing solutions with the relevant Departments of Civil Affairs, Education, and Construction. Furthermore, regarding deed taxes, taxes are often collected not through deed verification but by assigning quotas to villages and households. The stamp tax is also not strictly enforced through the purchase of stamps, but rather merchants are forced to recognize quotas on a monthly basis or according to gang distribution, causing great disturbance to farmers and merchants. Therefore, the public is also eager for the authorities to correct this. (July 14th)</p>

<p>The Changshu County Opium Prohibition Association has been in operation for over a month since its establishment. Currently, after a re-examination, there are over 17,000 opium smokers in the entire county. The registration of opium smokers is now underway. However, many opium smokers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Previously, the seventh meeting resolved to implement compulsory registration of opium smokers starting on August 1st. As for the establishment of opium paste stores, it has been decided that 35 locations will be set up throughout the county. However, there are currently over a hundred applications submitted. The association has decided to stop accepting applications from the 23rd and will determine the locations by drawing lots from the applications that have already been submitted.</p>

<p>In the city, rainfall began on the 21st of this month, and the Fahrenheit temperature dropped to 86 degrees. The next day, there was still a cool drizzle. In two days, the rainfall totaled about eight fen. However, it was not widespread in the countryside. Yesterday (the 23rd), the weather was clear and cool. After 3 AM, thunder rumbled, and heavy rain fell until 5:30 AM, with an estimated rainfall of over two inches. In the countryside, Rongxiang, Youjiadan, Changan Bridge, Nanqiao, and Qianqiao received three inches of rain, Yuqi received five fen, Qianzhou and Beiqifang received over an inch, Dongting received three inches, and the river level rose by five inches. Huadafangzhuang, Yangting, Yanqiao, and other places received two inches of rain, Bashi Bridge received three inches, and Dangkou and Ganlu received three inches. Zhangjing Bridge received two inches, and Anzhen received three inches. The rain was widespread in both urban and rural areas. Fields that had already been planted were sufficiently watered. Fields that had not yet been planted still could not be planted, but the soil was moistened, making it easier to plant after irrigating the fields. However, there is a lack of water-lifting machinery. It is hoped that another two or three inches of rain will fall in the coming days to remedy the situation. Xueyan Bridge, at the border of Wuxi and Changshu, also received three inches of rain. It is thought that Changshu, Cheng, Wuxi, and Suzhou counties have also received rain.</p>

<p>Xu Yiting, the owner of the Xintai Xiang Lace Shop in Shanghai, has a son named Xu Yibin, a student at Fudan University. Xu Yibin seduced a local female student named Chen Xueqin, initially promising to marry her and writing a letter of intent, but then abandoned her. Chen's father filed a lawsuit in Shanghai with the Special First Court, accusing Xu Yibin of undermining public morals. After Judge Liu Yugui summoned him, he deemed that the case was under the wrong jurisdiction and ruled to transfer it to the local court in our county for trial. Yesterday (the 24th) at 9:30 AM, Judge Liu Bingzhen of the local branch court summoned Chen Shengyang and his daughter Chen Xueqin to conduct a preliminary investigation. Because the case concerned morals, the court ordered that the hearing be closed to the public. However, it was heard that Chen Xueqin testified in court about the details of her seduction by Xu. As a result, the court ordered her to return home and await the summons of the defendant before further questioning.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, two to three hundred villagers arrived in Wangdian Town, Jiaxing, to demand rice from various rice shops, creating a serious situation. All the rice shops in the town immediately closed down. Later, after local people made great efforts to persuade them to leave, there were still a few poor villagers who did not disperse. After finding a way to give each person two sheng of rice, they finally left. The county government immediately dispatched representatives Mei Shouren and Lu Chujue to investigate on the 23rd. Unexpectedly, on the 23rd, over two thousand villagers from the Hai and Yan areas and the Yu Xian district arrived in the town (including salt traffickers and Hunan gangs). They broke into the rice shops of Pan Yaji (over one hundred shi of rice, over one hundred shi of beans, and over ten pieces of clothing were looted), Ding Heshun (over twenty shi of rice, over ten shi of beans, and over thirty silver dollars were looted), Yuan Tailong (over six shi of rice and over one shi of beans were looted), and Chen Yuantai (over one hundred shi of rice and over two hundred shi of beans were looted) in Dongli, Xili, Nantang, and Beitang, looting rice and beans. The shops throughout the town closed their doors one after another. The county's basic team and water police rushed from Jiaxing to the town. By noon, the villagers had dispersed. The police arrested six people, including Sun Ashun, Gao Asan, Shen Xilin, Yu Zuobin, Zhang Aliu, and Hu Asong, on the spot and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for detention. At the same time, the two representatives, Lu and Mei, convened a meeting of local people in the district office. As a result, it was decided to set up two porridge kitchens in the east and west to provide relief to poor farmers. The rice will be donated and supplied by the rice shops. The police and local guards will temporarily remain in the town to maintain order. On the other hand, the shops were encouraged to resume business as usual to maintain the market. The porridge kitchens are currently being actively prepared and will be established soon.</p>

<p>Due to the prolonged drought, about five hundred villagers from near Dong'an Town in Qidong gathered at the local temple to pray for rain on the afternoon of the 18th. A detachment of tax police stationed in the temple prevented the villagers from entering, resulting in a conflict between the two sides. More and more villagers gathered, trying to rush into the temple. Seeing that the situation was not good, the tax police opened fire, wounding five people. The villagers became even more enraged and captured two tax police messengers, beating them until they were injured. The situation became more and more serious. When County Magistrate Li learned of the incident, he rushed to the scene of the incident with Zhu Chuliang, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to persuade the villagers to hand over the messengers to the county government for processing. The injured villagers were sent to the county to verify their injuries and handle the matter fairly. The tax police were ordered not to take the above actions again.

<p>On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, at around 11:00 PM, eight or nine bandits armed with guns, knives, and other weapons broke into the home of Shen Youren in Bansha Township, Daishan, the sixth district of Dinghai, and robbed it. They also stabbed Shen Youren and his mother, Mrs. Shen, and his wife, Mrs. Li. When the township chief, Shen Pinyuan, and his son, Shen Quanyou, heard the alarm, they planned to gather people to arrest the bandits. However, as soon as they reached the door, they were spotted by the bandits and shot dead. The Second Security Division has ordered a strict investigation and arrest of the perpetrators.</p>

<p>A woodworker named A'ao, the son of Wang Fusheng, a farmer from Shantou Yantou, Linshan, the fourth district of Yuyao, had a wife named Xuan, who was lewd by nature and had an affair with a local ruffian named Xie A'ru. In the afternoon of the 20th, Xie took advantage of A'ao and his father being out and came to meet with Xuan. Unexpectedly, just as they were enjoying their tryst, A'ao suddenly returned home and discovered their secret. Seeing that the situation was not good, Xie fled. A'ao was filled with shame and anger and was determined to kill her. He took an axe and struck his wife Xuan on the head, killing her instantly. Fearing punishment, he then used the axe to strike his own head violently. Blood flowed all over the ground, and both of them collapsed in pools of blood. By the time his father returned home, A'ao was barely breathing.</p>

The shop secretly reported this to the First Division of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, which dispatched a patrol officer and several plainclothes policemen to the shop. At the appointed time, a young man wearing a silk gown came to the shop and asked for the manager. He was immediately arrested by the police. He confessed his name was Liu Taoying, 25 years old, and that he had served in the military for many years. He had resorted to this because he could not find a job. He was transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Sixth District Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched a large number of police officers to the airport and along Hongqiao Road to direct traffic. In addition, the Municipal Security Department and the Military Police Regiment also sent troops to the airport to provide security. Security was extremely tight.

<p>The company had previously erected a temporary mat shed on the south side of the airport as a place for guests to rest. Tea and snacks were set up on both sides of the shed. At 5:30 PM, the demonstration officially began. First, Sir Hamilton, an instructor at the Far East Aviation School in Hong Kong, piloted a new Avro trainer aircraft. The aircraft slowly rose from the airport and circled the airport sky once. Then, he performed various flying stunts, soaring to thousands of feet and then flying low over the heads of the audience. Each maneuver, whether flying upside down or sideways, was performed with ease. The dangerous maneuvers were met with applause and cheers. Then, he performed stunt flying, which was a novelty in Shanghai, flying only ten feet above the ground. The aircraft swayed its wings left and right like a drunk person walking at night, which was truly remarkable. After landing, Captain Peng Naide, the manager of the company, took off in a Fawn Fox fighter aircraft and performed a straight up and down maneuver at extremely high speed. Five minutes later, he performed various maneuvers of attacking enemy aircraft in combat. At around 6:00 PM, it suddenly started to rain, and the guests left the venue one after another. However, the two men continued to fly their planes, performing a chase and attack simulation. Finally, due to the heavy rain, they landed at 6:15 PM, leaving the audience unsatisfied.</p>

<h3 id="e135">True Cholera Discovered at Hongkou Epidemic Hospital <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Patient Zhang Xicai from Chongming Confirmed by Shanghai Municipal Council Laboratory</p>
<p>According to the Guo Wen News Agency, since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been unusually hot due to drought. Coolies and others, due to poor food and lodging, often sleep on the sidewalks of the roads, exposed to turbid air and heat. As a result, many people have contracted various summer diseases. Although there are many epidemic prevention facilities in Shanghai, they are still overwhelmed. The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital in the eastern district of Shanghai has become a leader in this regard due to its location. According to its daily reports, the number of people seeking treatment, the quality of its facilities, the widespread trust it enjoys, and the excellent results it achieves are all remarkable. Therefore, those who investigate the epidemic situation in Shanghai often use the hospital as a standard. Recently, the wind and rain have been intermittent, and the weather has suddenly turned cooler. Outpatient visits to various hospitals have been less frequent. However, there have been some unusual cases of true cholera discovered in Hongkou. Dysentery and gastroenteritis have not decreased slightly. If the weather becomes hot and humid, the outbreak of epidemics will be unstoppable. Furthermore, there have been cases of death due to peritonitis caused by scraping, indicating that the outdated treatments are not being eliminated, which is a hidden worry for society.</p>
<p>It is reported that the patient with true cholera is named Zhang Xicai, a native of Chongming who works at the China Iron Works. He was admitted to the Hongkou Hospital for treatment on the 18th of this month and was discharged on the 22nd after recovering. The Shanghai Municipal Council's laboratory confirmed that his stool contained true cholera bacteria. The Shanghai Municipal Council's laboratory report was issued on the 23rd.</p>

<p>According to the Guo Wen News Agency, due to the overcast weather and intermittent rain in the past three or four days, the heatwave has been swept away, and the maximum temperature has dropped below 90 degrees. Yesterday, the weather turned hot again, and the maximum temperature in the afternoon reached 91.6 degrees. Since the drought began last month, the total rainfall has only been 1.42 inches. The total rainfall from January 1st to the day before yesterday this year was 17.2 inches, while the average rainfall during the same period in the past 61 years was 27.3 inches. The difference is still significant, and the lack of rainfall is obvious.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Current Situation of Rong Zongjing's Shenxin and Other Factories After His Reinstatement <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Factories Operate as Usual and the Financial Industry is Determined to Maintain Support</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, Rong Zongjing's 21 Shenxin Textile Mills and Fuxin and Maoxin Flour Mills were previously reported to have suffered heavy losses due to the economic panic. Mr. Rong even retired once, and there were widespread rumors that the government would intervene to provide relief and reorganization. In order to learn the details, the New Sound News Agency reporter inquired with relevant parties yesterday and recorded the responses from the financial industry and Rong Zongjing as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e139">Financial Circle Opinions <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>According to the opinions of leaders in the banking and money exchange industries, regardless of the government's attitude and policies towards the various Shen Xin factories, the financial sector must do its utmost to maintain their existence. The scale of the Shen Xin factories is large, employing a large number of workers, and purchasing vast quantities of raw materials and other goods annually. Directly and indirectly, millions of people rely on them for their livelihoods. Furthermore, a significant number of Shanghai's financial institutions have business dealings with Shen Xin. For example, the Bank of China and other banks have extended the most industrial loans to Shen Xin. If there were to be any instability, the banking and money exchange industries would be affected, and social stability and the entire commercial market would suffer. Moreover, Rong Zongjing is one of the few remaining industrialists of his stature in China today. In terms of the number of spinning spindles, he accounts for one-fifth of the national total. For the sake of national enterprises, both the government and the public must unanimously assist in their progress. Therefore, the banking industry's sincerity in supporting these factories will not change, regardless of future circumstances. As for the panic in the industrial sector, it is currently a global phenomenon. China experienced something similar more than a decade ago. During the European War, textile factories in China sprang up like mushrooms after rain, and the Shen Xin yarn factories also expanded significantly at that time. Foreign exchange rates were very low at the time, and the cost of raw materials and machinery was relatively low. When the European War ended, foreign exchange rates suddenly soared, and unpaid debts more than doubled, causing temporary financial difficulties. At that time, the banking industry did its best to maintain stability, and there were no adverse effects. Subsequently, market conditions improved, and the Shen Xin factories became more prosperous, expanding year by year, from four factories to nine today.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Rong Zongjing's Talk <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Rong Zongjing told reporters, "I have been managing Shen Xin and other factories for over thirty years, and I have experienced many hardships. I have strived to develop the national economy and overcome foreign resistance. Although outsiders may not fully understand the details of this process, the general public should be aware of the struggles involved. In recent years, the textile industry has been in a difficult situation. Those engaged in the industry should do their best to fight for survival. In addition, the nation should also share the responsibility of maintaining this foundational industry, so that it can move forward with determination. This time, I am taking a temporary break due to a minor illness, and Mr. Wang Yuqing is taking over the management of the business. However, rumors have spread that Shen Xin's factories are not performing well and urgently need reorganization. This is truly laughable. The work and operations of each factory are still the same as before, and income and expenses are quite balanced. I don't know where these rumors come from. As for the staff and workers directly employed by the factories, there are no less than hundreds of thousands. According to the statistics for the twenty-first year, the raw materials used by the factories include 51.46 million yuan for cotton and 52 million yuan for wheat. In terms of national tax contributions, the import tax on foreign cotton is 3 million yuan per year, the factory tax on yarn, cloth, and flour is over 5.56 million yuan per year, and the import tax on machinery is over 3.5 million yuan, totaling over 13 million yuan. Over the decades of operation, there has been some benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood."</p>

<p>Tall Stalks and Lush Leaves in Shanxi and Shaanxi</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the National Economic Commission's Cotton Control Committee reports that in order to improve the cotton industry nationwide, the committee purchased high-quality cotton seeds this spring and distributed them to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Henan provinces for planting. According to investigations, due to a month-long drought this summer, the cotton stalks in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces could not grow tall, and the harvest is expected to be poor. However, in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces, the stalks are tall and the leaves are lush, with flourishing growth, and a bountiful harvest is expected.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Gu Xinyi Expresses His Opinion on Ordering Foreign Rice <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Says He Has Never Had Preconceived Notions</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday, Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, made the following statement regarding the ordering of foreign rice. Gu said, "I have never had preconceived notions about ordering foreign rice. However, the bankruptcy of the rural economy is an undeniable fact. During this lean season, most poor farmers have long run out of grain and are borrowing rice to survive. Although there is rice in storage in various places, it is only in the hands of wealthy hoarders. Now, with the sudden drought, rice prices have soared, making life even more difficult for the poor farmers. The only beneficiaries are a very small number of hoarders. The association has been ordered to control rice prices and has decided on both short-term and long-term measures. The long-term measure is to order foreign rice to suppress rice prices, which is to help the rural economy. This is entirely consistent with the government's intention to revitalize the rural economy. The association previously requested an increase in import duties on foreign rice, and now it is requesting the ordering of foreign rice, only because the times are different, but the fundamental principle of helping the rural economy remains the same. Now, I see reports that the rice industry in this city held a meeting at Ren Gu Tang to discuss the case of opposing the ordering of foreign rice to prevent famine, and decided to postpone the ordering to maintain the livelihoods of farmers. However, the people who attended the meeting at Ren Gu Tang were the same people who unanimously supported the ordering of foreign rice at the association's special meeting the other day. Why is there such a change? I have not yet understood the reason. As for the opposition expressed by rice merchants in various counties, they mostly claim that there is still a lot of rice in storage in various places. They don't realize that all the stored rice is in the hands of hoarders. How can they guarantee that they will not hoard and monopolize, harming the poor farmers? I am afraid that the only beneficiaries will be the hoarders, and the so-called saving the livelihoods of farmers will be empty words. If those who oppose it can guarantee a balanced rice price and prevent grain prices from harming the people, then I will never have any preconceived notions about ordering foreign rice."</p>

<p>According to a report in the local Japanese newspaper "Daily News" yesterday, Karakhan, the Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of Soviet Russia, has been appointed as the ambassador to Turkey. Before taking office, he personally traveled to Mongolia with several aircraft and vehicles donated by Soviet Russia to Outer Mongolia. On the 16th, a grand presentation ceremony was held in Ulaanbaatar. At the same time, in order to cope with its policy toward Japan, the Soviet authorities, led by Russian officers, organized two regiments of Mongolian cavalry. They also concentrated hundreds of aircraft, more than two thousand vehicles, and one hundred and fifty tanks and other new weapons in Chita, and established an independent garrison unit headed by Major General Fuyedko. They are actively promoting war preparations against Japan in Outer Mongolia.</p>

<p>The Japanese Government and Public Are Fanatically Preparing for War, Targeting Russia and the United States, with China Being Merely a Prize</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, Yang Yihui, a cadre of the Youth Association, was sent to Japan some time ago to conduct an inspection. He was seriously injured in Japan after being hit by a car, but has now recovered. He returned to China yesterday. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency went to interview him. Mr. Yang described in detail the fanatic state of war preparation among the Japanese government and public, as well as the economic panic within the country. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e145">Japanese War Preparations <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Yang, the Japanese government and public are united in their fanatic war preparation for the Second World War in 1960, which has reached an extreme level. Recently, war slogans with a strong sense of mobilization have been posted everywhere in the streets of cities across the country. In addition, almost all radio broadcasting stations have been controlled by the government, specializing in broadcasting war knowledge and air defense preparations, as well as various warning lectures on the seriousness of Japan's position in this war. Moreover, in various public amusement parks, there are special war experiment shows, which are very common. Children are welcome to enter for free, and military personnel conduct exercises on poison gas and machine guns, so that ordinary children develop a war mentality. All Japanese media are also largely controlled by the government, actively creating and promoting war-mongering opinions. Even entertainment venues such as movie theaters are used as tools to promote war preparation. For example, the famous film "The Last Command" recently shown in Japan tells the story of a group of children fighting for a bottle of milk, with the explanation that Japanese people will starve to death if they do not go to war. The film also depicts various non-factual renderings of Chinese people killing Japanese people, raping Japanese women, and abusing Japanese children, doing everything possible to provoke. Currently, the Japanese government and public have reached a unanimous attitude in their fanatic war preparation, and have scheduled three days of public war preparation exercises starting on July 26. The dissemination of this war ideology is centered on teaching shrines and Buddhist societies as its activity centers. The targets of its war preparation are no more than Russia and the United States. China is merely a prize in its pocket.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Overproduction <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the economy, due to the extreme development of the machine industry, all Japanese factories and businesses have formed a very serious state of overproduction. Currently, industrial products are piling up in major commercial ports such as Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagasaki, and are urgently awaiting large-scale shipment and dumping abroad. However, due to the widespread resistance of various countries to Japanese goods, Japanese merchants are in a rather difficult situation. Therefore, they have recently developed another plan to entice wealthy merchants in the South Pacific islands to invest in Japanese factories, so that they can use the South Pacific islands as a dumping ground for their excess goods. Therefore, the sales of our country's domestic products in the South Pacific will be greatly affected. According to Mr. Yang, during the week before he left Japan, the Japanese took advantage of our country's revision of the new tariff and shipped a large number of Japanese goods and daily necessities to China for promotion and sales. Under the active and intensified dumping of Japanese goods, the future of our country's domestic products is very worrying.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Recovery and Return <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>This time, Mr. Yang was sent by the General Association of the Chinese Christian Youth Association to Japan to investigate the political and economic situation. In Tokyo, he was seriously injured on the street by a Japanese car driver, suffering severe injuries to his arm and chest. At that time, his injuries were very dangerous. After being hospitalized for three weeks and receiving surgical treatment, he escaped danger. At that time, many Japanese people expressed their condolences to Mr. Yang. As for the medical expenses incurred, because the driver who caused the accident was in a very difficult situation, Mr. Yang himself bore all the expenses. Recently, his chest injuries have healed, so he immediately set off to return home. After a few days of recuperation, his arm is also expected to recover.</p>

<p>Hu Shize, our country's ambassador to Switzerland, asked for leave to return to China and went to Peiping to attend to his father's funeral. He arrived in Peiping yesterday and reported to the central government. It is now known that Mr. Hu will travel from Nanjing to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang, and then come to Shanghai on the 27th or 28th of this month, and then travel to his ancestral home in Wuxing for two days. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the Italian ship "Conte Verde" on the ninth of next month to return to his post in Europe. It is also learned that Mr. Li Jinlun, the ambassador to Czechoslovakia, will also travel to Europe on the same ship as Mr. Hu.</p>

<p>Gu Weijun, our country's ambassador to France, recently asked for leave to return to China to attend to private matters and report to the central government on the recent international situation. It is now known that Mr. Gu, because of the hot weather in Shanghai, took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Pu'an" ship at nine o'clock yesterday morning and left Shanghai for Qingdao to escape the heat. Mr. Gu is scheduled to stay in Qingdao for a short time, and will then transfer to Ganzhou to meet with Chairman Zhuang as soon as the weather cools down.</p>
<h3 id="e150">The Zhapu Road Disturbance Case: Pelham is Suspended <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>How Do Chinese Citizens Feel About This Punishment of a Western Detective?</p>
<p>According to the "Great American Evening Post," Pelham, the Western detective who attempted to arrest two Japanese sailors who assaulted a Chinese woman on Zhapu Road in Hongkou about a month ago, has now been suspended. This morning (24th), a reporter from the "Great American Evening Post" inquired with Police Chief Gerrard and other senior police officers about the matter, but they were all silent. However, Sterling Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was still responsive. According to what he told the reporter from the "Great American Evening Post," the report of the committee investigating the Hongkou case may be discussed at the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting tomorrow. It is still difficult to predict whether a decision will be made to release any information to the press. According to police regulations, any police officer accused of dereliction of duty must automatically suspend himself while the case is being investigated. Mr. Fessenden's words imply that Detective Pelham has been suspended due to the police department's investigation of the Hongkou disturbance case. When asked whether Mr. Pelham's suspension was permanent, Mr. Fessenden replied that it would have to be determined later. It is reported that the current action is for ninety days. However, according to reliable sources, the investigation committee has determined that Mr. Pelham's attempt to arrest the Japanese sailors was illegal. The reasons are: (1) Mr. Pelham attempted to arrest the perpetrators of a conflict that he did not witness; (2) Mr. Pelham did not take the Japanese sailors to the Japanese Naval Landing Force branch office on Zhapu Road, but attempted to send them to the Hongkou police station.</p>

<h3 id="e152">The Rickshaw Industry Petitions for Reconsideration of the New Vehicle Regulations <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Special Zone Office Submits a Document to the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors The Rickshaw Industry Association's Special Zone Office sent representatives Gu Songmao, Yin Zhiling, and Hou Shao'an, along with Shanghai Municipal Council Director Yu Qiaqing, to the Shanghai Municipal Council the day before to negotiate with Massey, Chairman of the Vehicle Management Committee, on the issue of license issuance, but no results were obtained. The association submitted a special petition to the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors yesterday, stating that it was submitting a petition for the Vehicle Management Committee to implement the resolutions.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Intensified <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Please allow a reconsideration to maintain the vehicle industry. It has been found that the Shanghai Municipal Council established a Rickshaw Committee in September of last year, purely for the purpose of investigating the state of the vehicle industry and improving vehicle affairs. Unexpectedly, the Vehicle Committee completely ignored the thorough statements of the vehicle merchants, and only relied on incomplete and untruthful investigations, considering them to be accurate. It rashly suggested reforming sixteen articles. Fortunately, the Council reviewed and shelved the three most unreasonable starting items.</p>
<h3 id="e154">To Be Shelved <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The remaining thirteen articles were all alarmist and managed to get through. In May of this year, the Rickshaw Management Committee was reorganized, and all the candidates were still the same. All the facilities have been intensified, making it difficult for vehicle owners to cope. The nature of rickshaws, the difficulties of the vehicle industry, and the urgent measures of the Management Committee must be applied for reconsideration. The reasons are stated one by one below: (1) There were originally 15,161 public rickshaws in the Public Concession, but they were reduced to 10,000 due to</p>
<h3 id="e155">Supply Exceeding Demand <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>After vehicle owners reduced and sacrificed, the rickshaw industry has become a semi-franchised industry. (2) Rickshaws in the Public Concession can be promoted throughout Shanghai, not only are vehicle owners and rickshaw pullers not restricted in their business, but passengers' transportation is also very convenient. However, vehicle owners must donate and obtain licenses from the three districts. In the past, a small number of vehicle licenses were donated by a large number of people. This is also a very systematic method stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Council. If vehicle owners donate themselves, just as the Huafa licenses still need to be donated by the donors, the vehicle owner's procedures will be increased as a result. (3) Operating a rickshaw business has recently seen an increase in expenses. In addition to the cost, the required rent, repairs, vehicle inspections, downtime, and contractor's remuneration all add up. Each vehicle must pay a rental fee of one yuan per day. If</p>
<h3 id="e156">Gradually Reduce <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Not only does it not conform to the law of supply and demand, but it will also make it impossible for the vehicle industry to maintain itself. (4) It has been found that the Shanghai Municipal Council announced on July 18 that the new rules for public rickshaw licenses Article 5 restricts the amount of fares, which directly makes people take electric cars and other rickshaws, and no one will be interested in rickshaws. What is meant by helping rickshaw pullers? (5) Article 19 of the announcement restricts vehicle rentals, which directly regards the rickshaw industry as the same as electric cars and other vehicles, and all become public franchise businesses. (6) However, a franchise business must have equal</p>
<h3 id="e157">Equal Conditions <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>It has been found that Articles 2 and 3 of the Shanghai Municipal Council's announcement state that licensees have the risk of not being able to inherit rights and interests. That is, rickshaw owners only have obligations to fulfill, but no right to protection. (7) The Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette, No. 5, Volume 30, published a notice to public rickshaw owners to prepay one yuan and five jiao per vehicle per month and collect mutual aid fees from rickshaw pullers. If the Huafa districts follow suit, the rickshaw pullers will not be able to bear the burden. Regardless of whether the facts can be done, the necessity of the vehicle owners fulfilling this obligation, that is, according to the Yangjingbang Lease Land Charter and its appendices, whether there is such authority, attention should be paid to the necessary. It is believed that the Shanghai Municipal Council has established a mutual aid association for rickshaw pullers, so all licensed businesses in the concession, such as tram, telephone, public car, tap water, fire, and all employees and tenants, etc., were all established by the Shanghai Municipal Council to help them. If each public enterprise and company is notified to prepay and collect mutual aid fees, the association</p>
<h3 id="e158">Should Abide By <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Its popularization method, and do its best to persuade all members and all vehicle owners to do their considerable obligations. (8) Moreover, the reforms of the new rules for rickshaw affairs proposed by the former Rickshaw Committee and resolved by the Shanghai Municipal Council are all planned to be implemented in January next year. The vehicle owners are not prepared at this time, but the Rickshaw Management Committee notified the vehicle owners in mid-July and ordered them to implement them on August 1. Its intensification is no more than this. (9) The Shanghai Municipal Council has always issued certificates for licensees without distinguishing between the four seasons. The autumn license is given, but it suddenly changed midway, and only allowed the license to be issued in July. After that, it will not be effective. Not only will the licensee</p>
<h3 id="e159">Lose Their Basis <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Even the Shanghai Municipal Council's document credibility will be affected by its shadow love. (10) In addition, the names of the vehicle owners registered are not published in the newspaper, so that those who are not true have the opportunity to correct them, and the certificates issued first contain hesitant words, one is called the vehicle owner, and the other is called the presumed vehicle owner, hiding the important meaning in front, and not responsible in the back. It is inappropriate to this extent. (10)(1) After the representatives of the above items repeatedly petitioned, requesting consideration of commercial difficulties, the Rickshaw Management Committee refused to change them all, and if they insisted on going their own way, causing the business to</p>
<h3 id="e160">On the Verge of Bankruptcy <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Then the livelihoods of tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers and their families in this city will inevitably perish together, and if it affects public order in the future, who will be responsible? (10)(2) The purpose of the association's request is as follows: (A) The license will still follow the old example, or follow the method of the rice industry association's entire license, and the association is willing to do its obligations and earnestly persuade the vehicle owners to proceed smoothly within the possible scope of the new rules for vehicle affairs, saving the expenses of the Shanghai Municipal Council Management Office and reducing the burden on taxpayers. (B) Whether the rickshaw industry is franchised or not, its rights and obligations should be mentioned equally and must be protected. (C) The Shanghai Municipal Council's</p>
<h3 id="e161">Relief Rickshaw Pullers <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Mutual Aid Association is not a perfect policy, and it is not necessary for the administrative authorities to do so. It has been found that the vehicle owners have been organizing relief activities for the rickshaw pullers for many years, and they are now gradually expanding. Newspapers can be checked. If the Shanghai Municipal Council considers that it is not yet comprehensive, it will still be promoted by the association and supervised by the Shanghai Municipal Council, which is in line with the true meaning of relief. In summary, the situation is urgent and dare to file a document and request the Council to consider the commercial difficulties and care for the coolies, and submit it for reconsideration. If the request is approved, the vehicle industry will be fortunate, the society will be fortunate, and the mother will wait for orders.</p>

<p>After the Control Yuan filed an impeachment against Railway Minister Gu Mengyu, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited the banking syndicate that provided the guarantee yesterday.

If there were any malpractices, the banking syndicate would never provide a guarantee. Although Minister Gu has been impeached, the banking syndicate's guarantee will continue to be valid.</p>

<p>Esteemed Sir, Zuoting and others, though inept, have been publicly elected to bear heavy responsibilities. Standing at the edge of a frozen abyss, we know to be cautious, constantly mindful of the danger of rotten ropes. Fortunately, we have the rules of Xiao He as models to follow. Examining past cases of the chamber, there was originally a category of special directors, filled by those with great prestige in industry and commerce, to prepare for consultations in advance and gather elders in one place. The method was good and the intention beautiful, and we can learn from past events. Therefore, based on this principle, during the fourth Executive Committee meeting, it was proposed that a special Advisory Committee be established in the chamber, and that former chairmen or standing committee members be invited as members of the committee to offer their valuable advice from their positions of retirement, enhancing chamber affairs and complementing each other. It was also proposed that, given Your Esteemed's seniority in the business community, great talent, and widespread respect throughout the city, You should be invited to be a member of the Advisory Committee of the chamber. The resolution was unanimously passed. We now enclose the full text of the nine articles of the regulations of the committee and respectfully invite You to offer guidance and resolve doubts. We rely on Your great wisdom and earnestly request Your agreement, so as to satisfy public expectations.</p>
<h3 id="e172">All Zhejiang Public Association Requests Suspension of Construction Special Tax <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>All Zhejiang Public Association telegram to Zhejiang Provincial Government: Respectfully to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Zhejiang Province has long been known as a region with heavy taxes. In recent years, the implementation of various new policies has invariably relied on surcharges on land taxes, exhausting resources to catch fish, and the people of Zhejiang have felt increasingly distressed, leading to the tragic collapse of the rural economy today. The central government, concerned about the people's suffering, has repeatedly issued clear orders that surcharges on land taxes should not exceed one times the regular tax. Recently, the National Financial Conference also resolved to abolish surcharges on land taxes in various provinces and eliminate all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, transferring the stamp tax and tobacco and alcohol license tax, which belong to national taxes, to the local provinces to offset the reduction of surcharges and exorbitant taxes. Upon investigation, Zhejiang's land tax surcharges have many items, and the construction special tax, with an additional one yuan per tael of land tax and one yuan per stone of grain compensation, is the largest. In the previous period, it accounted for 55.6% of the surcharges, and in the next period, it accounted for 30.3%, nearly 45% of the total surcharges. Therefore, to alleviate the people's suffering and reduce surcharges, this surcharge should be abolished as soon as possible, so as to comply with the central government's clear orders and comfort the people's expectations. Moreover, this special tax was initially named the military special tax and was originally limited to one year. Later, it was changed to the construction special tax, which is inconsistent with the original plan and has lost the people's trust. Now it is allocated to the debt fund. According to the meeting of various departments, it cannot be reduced until the debt reorganization plan is completely completed. The counties are allowed to exclude this special tax when calculating the total amount of land tax surcharges to show that they are not violating the method of not exceeding one times the regular tax. In name, they are complying with the order to reduce, but in reality, they are collecting as usual. The people's resources are exhausted, how can they bear this heavy burden for a long time? Moreover, although this special tax has been designated as a debt fund, the annual revenue is only 3 million yuan. The expenses of Zhejiang's judicial system at all levels should be paid by national taxes. This has been proposed and approved by the Financial Conference, which can save 1.8 million yuan of provincial funds annually. Using this to replace the special construction tax for debt reorganization should be more than sufficient, which is both in line with the original allocation plan and can reduce the people's burden, a win-win situation. As for the expenses of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, which amount to more than 700,000 yuan annually, according to the precedents before 1928, there were special funds to handle it. From 1912 to 1926, it was paid from the shop tax and various police taxes in the provincial capital. In 1927, the police force was expanded, and a housing tax was added, all of which are documented. It seems unnecessary to list it in the provincial treasury to handle local public security with local taxes. Secondly, the telephone bureau run by the Construction Department has now merged with the Ministry of Communications Telephone Bureau. In addition to business income, it can save 800,000 yuan in expenses each year. Other departments and their affiliated institutions that waste provincial funds are not in the minority. If a policy of austerity can be implemented and ways can be found to abolish them, other surcharges can be gradually reduced. However, due to factual constraints, it may not be possible to merge them all at once, so our association has not dared to request the abolition of all surcharges, only requesting that the construction special tax, which harms the people the most, be suspended first as an initial measure to comply with laws and regulations to reduce land tax surcharges. The handling of it should not be difficult. Reducing the people's financial resources by one point is equivalent to leaving one point of vitality for the countryside. At this time of severe drought, we especially hope that the special government will be implemented to pacify the floating population and provide relief. The case was proposed and passed by the entire membership of the 10th Membership Congress of our association. We urgently telegram this matter, hoping that the government will examine and approve it, and order the construction special tax to be suspended from the next period of this year to alleviate the people's suffering. We await orders with the utmost urgency. Shanghai All Zhejiang Public Association.</p>

<p>The Cigarette Business Committee previously received a letter from the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, soliciting opinions on the unified cigarette tax. The committee convened a meeting on the afternoon of the 24th of this month. Those present were Secretary Dong, Section Chief Jiang, and Section Chief Tang of the Tax Affairs Department, as well as Committee members Qiu Tingsheng, Shen Weiting, Chen Maonan, Ding Baiquan, Bao Gengsheng, and British American Tobacco Company representatives Bai Xiji and Liang Fuchu, and Da Mei Tobacco Company representative Zhu Junqing. The meeting was chaired by Bao Gengsheng. The resolutions are as follows: 1. Regarding the tax matter, Zhu Junqing advocated maintaining the current two-tier tax system, which was seconded by Chen Maonan. The BAT representatives agreed with Huacheng and said that the current unified tax is too heavy. It would be best to reduce it. If it cannot be reduced, and if business still fails to increase after the summer, the government should be asked to reconsider the request for tax reduction. There is no inequality in the current tax rate, which has been explained by the Tax Affairs Department. Ding Baiquan said that the proposal of the Minzhong Tobacco Company and others advocates increasing taxes on upper-grade cigarettes and reducing taxes on lower-grade cigarettes. Now that taxes on lower-grade cigarettes cannot be reduced, they also do not want taxes on upper-grade cigarettes to be increased. Bao Gengsheng seconded Ding's proposal. Shen Weiting seconded Ding's proposal. It was resolved to maintain the current two-tier tax system and continue to implement it, and to ask the Chinese cigarette manufacturers' association to convene members in groups to solicit opinions on this resolution in order to make a decision. 2. The BAT representatives proposed that, regarding the conflict of interest between high-grade and low-grade cigarettes, each cigarette manufacturer should discuss it separately and submit the results to the Cigarette Business Committee for review and referral to the Tax Affairs Department. The resolution was to approve. 3. The monthly sales of hand-rolled cigarettes have reached more than 20,000 cases, and there is also a lot of smuggling and tax evasion, leading to the decline of machine-made cigarette business. Since they are both cigarettes, they should pay the same tax. The resolution was to approve. 4. Regarding how to dispose of 280 cases of confiscated cigarette paper, the resolution was to send a letter to the Tax Affairs Department, requesting it to ask the Customs Department to destroy all of the confiscated cigarette paper. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>Lang Zuyin Consistently Fails to Appear After Being Summoned, Litigation Procedures Not Halted Due to Negotiations</p>
<p>The case of Lang Zuyin, a Chinese detective of the Old Zhabei Police Station, and Bao Defu, the owner of the Longshun Gongdi Goods Firm on Lijian Road, being accused of false accusation and injury by Cai Yangqi and his wife Cai Fan of Chongming, who hired lawyer Lu Jiaoyu from the No. 1 Special Court, because Lang repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned, causing the court to negotiate with the Public Concession authorities, which has not been resolved to date, has been reported in this newspaper several times. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the No. 1 Special Court opened the Second Criminal Division to summon again, but Lang Zuyin still did not appear. Judge Liu immediately announced that the case had been submitted by the court to the Ministry of Justice, which had requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct negotiations based on the agreement. However, the litigation procedures in this case will not be halted due to the negotiations. Therefore, it will be postponed again today and rescheduled for a hearing at 2:00 PM on August 17th. However, for the convenience of both parties, neither party needs to appear in court before Lang appears. Once Lang Zuyin is summoned, the court will notify both parties to appear and conduct the trial. The judge then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Ji Zejin Discusses Japan's Cultivation of Tung Trees <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Already Trying to Grow Them on Jeju Island This Year, Seeking to Monopolize the World's Tung Oil Market</p>
<p>According to Mr. Ji Zejin, director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, yesterday, tung oil is a specialty product of China and is essential for the furniture industry and the anti-corrosion of automobile bodies. The number exported to Japan each year is quite large. According to last year's statistics, the amount exported to Japan reached 9,808 dan, worth 235,508 yuan. The Governor-General of Korea has decided to find ways to encourage the cultivation of tung trees in order to prevent this import. Although China has imposed severe restrictions on the export of tung oil seeds, Mr. Takahashi Shigetaro, the manager of the Seoul branch of Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd., had a plan to collect tung oil seeds and transplant them to Japan when he was working in China. He has now started trial planting on Jeju Island in Jeolla-namdo. If the results are good, he will encourage large-scale planting in the coastal areas of Jeolla-namdo. Japan is cultivating tung trees and developing the tung oil industry in an organized and planned way using scientific methods, and its progress will naturally be rapid. Soon, Japan will be able to be self-sufficient in tung oil and will not need to rely on China. In the future, it may even export it to Europe and the United States and monopolize the world's tung oil market. Now, after several years of effort, the Japanese silk industry has captured the markets of China, Europe, and the United States. In a few years, I am afraid that China's tung oil market will also be seized. This shows the efforts of the Japanese, and the Chinese people must pay special attention to it. (New News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e179">Daily Inventory of Antiques <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Location of Antiquities Storage Depository (Beijing or Shanghai) Not Yet Decided</p>
<p>The antiques from the Palace Museum stored in Shanghai are still being inventoried daily. The responsible authorities believe that storing a large number of antiques in Shanghai requires a huge amount of rent each month, and they all advocate building an antiquities storage depository in the Capital Cemetery to store them. Some in Shanghai advocate building one in Shanghai. The construction of the depository has already been decided, but whether it will be in Shanghai or Beijing is still under negotiation. However, according to what Chu Minyi, the secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, said when he was in Shanghai last time, the site will likely be built in the cemetery, and an antiquities exhibition hall will be built next to the depository to display them in batches for public viewing. However, the planning of the funding is still under discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Customs Office Considers Dried Seafood from the Coast to Be Japanese Goods <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Ship Owner Reports to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Requesting a Letter to the Jianghai Customs Office for Certification</p>
<p>The two sandboats, Jin Deyuan and Jin Xinghe, from Hupu, loaded more than 400 pieces of dried fish, each weighing about two dan, from Dage Mountain and Zhangzi Island (both islands) in the Northeast. Because this year's production was not prosperous, the two ships were not even half-loaded. They arrived in Songjiang the day before yesterday and reported to the Jianghai Customs Office in Paotaiwan (also known as the Huangchuan) as usual. When the customs officers went to the two fishing boats for inspection, two old copper plates with the words "South Manchuria Railway" and a few small boxes of Japanese-made matches and cigarettes were found on the ships. This caused the customs officers to suspect that the dried fish loaded on the two ships was from Dalian and planned to confiscate the goods. The crew explained that the copper plates were old and discarded items, but they were not discarded because of their copper material. The matches and cigarettes were indeed purchased from Dalian. Because Dage Mountain and Zhangzi Island are only separated from Dalian by a sea, after the daily necessities prepared in the ship were used up, they had to be purchased from Dalian. However, the dried fish loaded was indeed purchased from Dage Mountain and Zhangzi Island, and there are shipping lists and money order from the firm in that place as proof. The Customs believed that the list and other documents could not be recognized as sufficient evidence, so they reported the situation to the Shanghai Customs Commissioner for handling, so that the two sandboats had been in Songjiang for two days, but the matter had not been resolved, so it was not convenient to open the cabin for sale, and the intangible losses were already considerable. The shipowner reported to the Sandboat Association and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting a letter to the Customs Office, proving the above circumstances and releasing them quickly to avoid being innocently harmed. The intent of the government to be lenient to fishermen with dried fish is to exempt them from taxation. However, the loading procedures are extremely strict. All ships going to load dried fish must first report to the Shanghai Customs Office before sailing, then go to the Wusong branch office to sign before they can sail. After loading the dried fish, they must go to the Shidao Customs to sign back to Shanghai. If no dried fish is loaded, they must return to Shanghai empty, and they are not allowed to turn to other places to load other goods. The customs declaration procedures are very solemn, and they can never deceive the customs and secretly load Japanese goods.</p>

<p>The Defendant's Ruling Deemed Invalid, Jiande Team Finally Wins the Lawsuit</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Jiande Society's ping-pong team previously participated in the Champagne Cup ping-pong competition organized by the Racecourse Tongren Club. During the finals between the Jiande team and the Guangdong team on May 26, the Jiande team, because it was the period for the preliminary selection of Chinese and Japanese Far Eastern ping-pong players, had no time to attend. According to the regulations, it requested a postponement, but was not approved. The referee then ruled that the Jiande team forfeited once and was ranked second. The Champagne Cup competition committee changed the referee's ruling and re-ruled that the Jiande team withdrew halfway through, and the scores were completely disregarded, and distributed texts to slander the team's reputation. The Jiande team captain, Lu Xiulu, hired lawyers Yang Ruinian, E Shen, and Yin Jingzhu to sue the competition committee staff members Li Hongfa, Lu Xiniao, Shen Dingyi, Shen Zhirui, Lu Hanjun, and Weng Shoufeng in the First Special Court for abusing their power and illegal ruling, and requested that the ruling of withdrawal be confirmed as invalid. The defendants also hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai to defend them. The debate has ended, and the details have been reported in this newspaper. This case is a correction of errors in the sports world and is greatly related to sportsmanship and morality, so people in society attach great importance to the outcome of this case. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Qinglan of the First Special Court opened the Fourth Civil Division and announced the verdict, the main text of which confirmed that the withdrawal ruled by the defendant was invalid, and the litigation costs were borne by the defendant.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Ji Juemi Receives Another Threatening Letter <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Instructing Ji to Release Zhang Huaiqing Quickly and Pay Compensation of 4,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Four Suspects Detained Opposite the Kaiming Bookstore, Xu of the Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. Manager, Descendant of Pan from Xuzhou, Ji Juemi's ancestral tomb was buried in Panjiazhuang, his hometown. From November last year to March this year, his father and aunt's remains were exhumed and their bones stolen by local bandits. Then, five letters were written and delivered to Ji, threatening him and extorting 200,000 yuan for ransom, etc. Zhu Jihuang, a Chinese detective of the Yangshupu Police Station, arrested Zhang Huaiqing, a native of Xuzhou and the leader of the gang, at 1252 Avenue Foch, and sent him to the First Special District Court. He repeatedly denied the accusations during interrogations, as detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui continued the hearing in the Third Criminal Division. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that around 9:00 AM yesterday, the plaintiff received another threatening letter from the Zhang Case Support Association, naming Xuzhou compatriot Zhang. The letter detailed that Zhang Huaiqing (i.e., the defendant) should be released quickly and compensation of 4,000 yuan should be paid, otherwise they would take drastic measures. They were to be contacted at a certain place on Fuzhou Road around 7:00 AM this morning. The Chinese and Western detectives handling the case went undercover and waited opposite the Kaiming Bookstore and detained four more suspects named Zhang. The police station is currently conducting a detailed investigation to clarify the matter and will hand over the case. The letter was presented for inspection and shown to the defendant, who firmly denied that his name was Zhang Huaiqing. He claimed to know nothing about the accusations, nor did he know anything about his accomplices sending letters to rescue him, evasively trying to get out of it. Ji's nephew, Pan Yanqing, testified that he had sent his nephew, Pan Litian, to Wuxi to contact the defendant. At first, he said it would be at least 20,000 yuan, but the result was reduced to 4,000 yuan. Then, he asked him to come to Shanghai to take the money and arrest him. However, Pan Litian reported that he had gone to an inn inside the North Gate of Wuxi and reached an agreement with the defendant, and that he had a letter from him that he brought back. When asked, the defendant said that none of this was true and asked for consideration. Judge Liu ordered that he be remanded in custody and the case be reviewed at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e183">The Liang Sisters Dancing Girls Case Has Hopes for Reconciliation <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Both Parties' Opinions Are Very Close, Da Hu Proposes the Lowest Conditions</p>
<p>Since the dancing girls Liang Saizhen and her sisters Saizhu and Saishan left the Da Hu Dance Hall on June 15th of this year and joined the Vienna Dance Hall, Da Hu, on the grounds that they had violated the contract, hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Peng to file a lawsuit against the Liang sisters in the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting compensation of 14,455.32 yuan. This case has been opened for hearing by Judge Luo Chongtai once, but because of the dispute between the two parties over whether Liang Saizhen's age, whether she has reached adulthood, the court considered it necessary to investigate, so the hearing was adjourned, which has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that after the postponement, the Liang family hired powerful people to approach Da Hu and request reconciliation. After several consultations, both parties felt that they had been guests and hosts for a long time and did not want to break up over trivial matters, so the conditions were very close, and there was a possibility of reconciliation. Therefore, when it was scheduled to be heard yesterday morning, the main actors, the Liang sisters, did not appear in court. Only their attorneys, Wu Kaisheng and Ni Jiong, appeared. However, many ladies still came to the court to listen in. At ten o'clock, the case was opened for hearing. The defendant's attorney, Wu Kaisheng, immediately stated that the case was now in the process of reconciliation, and the conditions were very close, and the lawyers on both sides were also very willing to reconcile, so he requested that the postponement be approved. The plaintiff's attorneys, Jiang Yiping and Wu Peng, then stood up and expressed their agreement. Judge Luo then declared that if there was hope for reconciliation in this case, then a postponement might as well be granted, otherwise the three defendants must appear in court next time, and the judge must question them to avoid delaying the matter. The court then ordered that the case be postponed to 9:30 AM on August 4th for another hearing. It is heard that the conditions proposed by Da Hu are for the defendants to repay the public funds and publish an apology in the newspaper, and to compensate for considerable losses.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Failure in Speculation Leads to Embezzlement of Over 30,000 Yuan <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Deputy Accountant of Kangda Money Exchange Arrested, Admits in Trial Yesterday to Misusing Funds</p>
<p>Qi Ruqiao, approximately 35 years old and a native of Shao, previously served as a deputy accountant at the Kangda Money Exchange located at 2 Shandong Road. Later, due to failures in his speculative business ventures, he gradually embezzled funds amounting to over 30,000 yuan. On February 8th of this year, unable to make restitution, he fled without a trace. After the money exchange discovered this, they immediately reported it to the Laozha Police Station for arrest. It wasn't until the other day that police detectives learned of Qi's hideout. They secretly went to the address at approximately 9 a.m., arrested him, and brought him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One. The police station's lawyer, Gan Jingxian, filed a public prosecution based on Article 357 of the Criminal Code for embezzlement. According to Qi Ruqiao's confession, he resided at No. 100 Lafayette Road and admitted to misusing over 20,000 yuan of the money exchange's funds due to speculative business failures, but not over 30,000 yuan. He also stated that the money exchange had already filed a private prosecution against him in the Second Special District Court. Yesterday was the scheduled trial date. He went to await questioning but was suddenly arrested by detectives upon arriving at the court. Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the confession and ordered a postponement for further questioning, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Shortage Discovered in Managed Stock After the Death of Macrool <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Deceased Was General Manager of International Trust Company, Etc.; Shortage of Over 16,000 Yuan in Managed Stock</p>
<p>The Damei Evening News reports that the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm was established as a partnership of three people. One of the partners, Mr. Macrool, recently passed away from heatstroke. It has now been discovered that there were irregularities in the stock Mr. Macrool managed on behalf of the International Investment Trust Co. and the Yantsze Finance Co., with a shortage reported. Yesterday (the 23rd), British Assessor Mo Su, stationed in China, approved the appointment of Mr. Hartman of the Kezuo Accounting Firm and Mr. Tengner, a partner of the deceased, to jointly manage the deceased's estate and continue the investigation. According to Mr. Maclair of the Gao Yi Law Office, representing the applicant, Tengner, the deceased was the general manager of the aforementioned two companies. Of the 37,950 shares of the Shanghai Manufacturing Electrical Company's stock that he managed, only 21,600 shares have been found, resulting in a shortage of 16,350 shares. It was also stated that the deceased's estate is valued at approximately 200,000 yuan but has proven insufficient to cover debts. The Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm has now notified the shareholders of both companies of this matter and stated that the stock was entrusted to the deceased for individual management, and the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm is not responsible for it. The contract between Xue Mailuo and the two companies clearly stipulated that they only held a secretarial position. It is difficult to determine when these irregular activities occurred, as the stock was still complete during the annual audit on March 31st, as evidenced by the auditor's report. The auditor is still conducting an investigation to determine the actual loss. It is reported that the deceased left a will entrusting his wife to manage all his estate. His wife recently went to Europe, so no one is currently taking care of the deceased's estate, hence the current application for provisional management.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Engineering Society Meeting; Sichuan Inspection Group Lectures <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers held a meeting at the Bankers' Club on the evening of July 23rd. Over 40 members attended. After dinner, Chairman Xu Peihuang reported on the society's affairs. Next, the branch's proposals for the current annual meeting were discussed. Subsequently, members Xu Shanxiang, Dai Ji, and Ren Shangwu, who had recently returned to Shanghai after inspecting Sichuan in April of this year, delivered lectures on their inspection experiences, the current situation in Sichuan, and their personal impressions. They briefly stated that Sichuan is naturally rich and abundant in resources, such as sugar, salt, silk, paper, and other products. Tung oil is an important export commodity for our country in recent years. The Sichuan authorities are determined to govern and are actively reorganizing land and water transportation. Bandit suppression work and construction projects are progressing simultaneously. Those in charge of education strive for practicality and do not value empty fame, which is commendable. Mining can reach a depth of 350 zhang, which shows the skills of the Sichuan people. In addition, there are model villages, research institutes, hospitals, and everything else that should be there. However, the currency system in various places is chaotic, and there were many miscellaneous taxes and levies in the past, which the people could not bear. Now, it is hoped that there will be no more heavy taxation in the future. At present, Sichuan's budget plans to invest in many production projects but has little money for construction. In short, Sichuan is rich in raw materials. If there are talents to study them, coupled with funds to equip machines, and engage in operation and manufacturing, it can make the country self-sufficient and self-reliant. However, Sichuan's industry is still a rural sideline and needs to be gradually improved. Given time, the future prospects are infinite. In addition, Mr. Ren also lectured on the unique scenery of Mount Emei, such as the Buddha's light and ten thousand bright lamps, which was unprecedented. The meeting adjourned after 11 p.m.</p>

<p>Due to the publication of "Idle Talk About Yangzhou" written by Yi Junzuo, director of the Editorial Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, by the Zhonghua Book Company, it aroused public outrage among people from Yangzhou. Various places have organized committees to investigate the "Idle Talk About Yangzhou" book. The Yangzhou Eight Counties Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai also convened a special emergency meeting of its members, resolved to organize the Yangzhou Fellow-Villagers in Shanghai Investigation Committee on "Idle Talk About Yangzhou," issued a declaration against the Zhonghua Book Company, and sent telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, and the Ministry of Education, requesting that the Zhonghua Book Company be stopped from distributing "Idle Talk About Yangzhou," that the printing plates of "Idle Talk About Yangzhou" be destroyed, and sent telegrams to Central Committee member Wang Boling and Yu Jingtang, Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, requesting them to uphold justice for their fellow villagers. The details of the process have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. According to a Xin Xin News Agency reporter's investigation, the matter is now being mediated by Xue Dubi, the former Minister of the Interior who is now a lawyer in Shanghai, who was brought in by a certain party. He is trying his best to mediate with the Yangzhou Eight Counties Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai. However, the Yangzhou Eight Counties Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai believes that the matter is of great importance and it will be difficult to accept mediation without the consent of all fellow villagers in Yangzhou. They only agreed to present the mediation opinions stated by the mediator at the committee meeting of the Yangzhou Fellow-Villagers in Shanghai Investigation Committee on "Idle Talk About Yangzhou" at 4 p.m. today. However, since the case occurred, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Central Government have paid great attention to it. Whether the mediation of lawyer Xue Dubi can satisfy both parties depends on the attitude of the members of the Yangzhou Fellow-Villagers in Shanghai Investigation Committee on "Idle Talk About Yangzhou" this afternoon.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Loving-Kindness Children's Association agreed to take over the Zhabei Civilian Fosterage Home, it has been actively carrying out various procedures. Yesterday, the association held a board of directors meeting and resolved to officially take over on the first of next month. According to Chen Tiesheng, the general secretary of the association, the Loving-Kindness Children's Association has decided to officially take over the Zhabei Civilian Fosterage Home on August 1st, but if the other party is unable to complete the handover in time, it may be postponed to August 10th, which is not certain. The fosterage home has an old fund of 80,000 yuan and a monthly income of about 600 yuan, which is insufficient to cover the expenses of supply, affairs, and education. In the future, the Loving-Kindness Children's Association will provide an additional subsidy of 400 yuan per month. As for the title of director of the fosterage home, it will be held by Xu Jianping, the general secretary of the Loving-Kindness Children's Association. If Mr. Xu is too busy with the Ministry of Finance and cannot take care of it, then Chen Tiesheng, the deputy general secretary, will take the position. Wang Guanyi, a member of the association's board of directors, will be fully responsible for the educational aspect.</p>

At 10 a.m. on the morning of the 22nd, it sailed to the river surface 130 miles above Yichang, about 40 miles from Wanxian, in a place called Shizhuangzi. Because the water flow was very rapid and navigation was difficult, it hit a reef.</p>
<p>Telegram Sent for Assistance: After hitting the reef, the shipowner, Aitison, immediately used wireless telegraph to seek assistance and surveyed the place where the reef was hit. The bottom of the ship was broken by the reef, and river water entered. The ship was stranded on the reef, and would not sink immediately. He immediately comforted all the passengers, asking them to maintain order and assuring them that there was no danger, and to wait quietly for rescue.

At the same time, the Yi'an Wheel, which sailed from Chongqing to Shanghai, received the telegram en route and rushed to the rescue at full speed. The barge arrived the day before yesterday, and the Yi'an Wheel arrived yesterday morning. They are currently working together to rescue. The Qiping Wheel, which set off from Shanghai on the 20th of this month, has been equipped with towing equipment in Hankou and is expected to arrive at the scene of the accident on the 27th. At that time, if the Qichun Wheel has not yet escaped danger, the Qiping Wheel will engage in towing rescue.</p>
<p>Cargo Unloaded, Passengers Safe: The Shanghai head office received a telegram yesterday morning stating that the Qichun Wheel was loaded with approximately 200 tons of goods, including cigarettes, foreign sundries, and mail. The cargo has been unloaded by the rescuing barge. As for the passengers, they are all safe. The unloaded goods and passengers will be transferred to the Yi'an Wheel and sailed back to Wanxian and Chongqing. There was no loss of passenger and crew luggage, only some of the cargo was water damaged.</p>
<p>Gunboat Protection: The American gunboat "Palos," which is stationed in Hankou, has sailed to the scene of the accident to protect the Qichun Wheel and prevent bandits from taking the opportunity to loot. It arrived yesterday and is parked next to the Qichun Wheel for protection.</p>
<p>Minimal Losses: A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with a Chinese staff member of the shipping department of the Shanghai head office yesterday morning. According to the interview, the Qichun Wheel hit a reef, the cargo has been unloaded, and the passengers are safe, so the losses are minimal. Only some of the cargo was water damaged.

It is scheduled to start on August 1st and graduate at the end of September. Since registration began on July 20th, enrollment has been very enthusiastic, and most of the students are business staff. It can be seen that improved Chinese bookkeeping has generated a deep need in the business community. There are no age or gender restrictions for admission. Anyone who is literate and has some accounting experience is qualified. When registering for admission, students must take an examination in Chinese and abacus, but those who have been certified by industry associations or companies as being literate and having accounting experience can be exempted from the examination. Recently, many people from various industries have been submitting letters of recommendation to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and accountant Xu's office, and their purpose is to train accounting staff in order to improve bookkeeping. It is reported that classes are held from 7:40 a.m. to 8:40 a.m., which does not interfere with regular duties. The fees are very low, only 2 yuan per person for tuition, plus 2 yuan for textbooks and practice booklets. It is truly an excellent opportunity for those who aspire to learn bookkeeping. Accountant Xu's office is currently printing a large number of account books and forms for practical use in the training course.

<h3 id="e195">Rice Boat Owners Meet to Discuss Wharf Donation and Shenghe Issues <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, rice boat owners from various ports in the south gathered at Yizhichun in Nanshi to discuss wharf donation and rice unloading Shenghe (a type of commission) matters. It was discussed that in 1930, the rice industry purchased and built a dedicated rice industry wharf in Xuejia浜, Nanshi. Due to the large expenses, the rice industry resolved to collect a wharf donation of 1 cent per stone as construction costs, which would be stopped when fully collected. Although this donation was collected from the rice industry in the interior, the rice merchants in the interior hired boats to transport rice to Shanghai and repeatedly instructed not to deduct wharf donation from the rice money of the trade and repeatedly sent letters to Shanghai rice merchants and brokers for negotiation, but with no effect. Therefore, last month, rice industries from various ports in the interior came to Shanghai to convene a joint meeting of rice merchants and boat owners, requesting the bean and rice industry association to publicly announce the accounts of the wharf donation. If they do not comply, the wharf donation will be stopped from July. The wharf donation is still being collected. Therefore, the rice merchants in the interior instructed to hire boats to transport rice to Shanghai. If the wharf donation is extracted again, the rice merchants in the interior will not recognize it and ask our boat owners to be responsible. This matter affects the transportation of our boat owners. After discussion, tomorrow all boat owners will gather at the Rice Merchants Association to report the situation of the rice industry in the interior that refuses to bear the wharf donation because there is no accurate and detailed account announced and request to negotiate and stop the collection. Secondly, the issue of reducing Shenghe was discussed. Requesting the cargo owners in the interior to reduce Shenghe caused disputes, and a standard should be set as soon as possible so that there will be no loss in the future. After discussion, please ask the rice merchants to mediate with the interior.</p>

Therefore, the hospital purchased a boat ticket for him and provided funds to return to his hometown, so as to avoid wandering in a foreign land and to reunite with his family.

<p>National Doctor He Huai Zhi Offers Free Consultations He Huai Zhi, a national doctor from Wujin, has been specializing in internal and external medicine for more than 40 years since he started practicing medicine. Those who have been treated by him have always achieved remarkable results. The year before last, he was invited by Vice Minister Li of the Ministry of Finance to Shanghai to treat illnesses and was retained by his colleagues. He set up a clinic at No. 4 Yongshou Lane, Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Laohai Road. The telephone number is 94834. Now, the Zhabei Charity Association and the Changzhou fellow villagers have consulted and invited Mr. He to offer free consultations. Because it is summertime, there are many poor and sick people who cannot afford medical treatment. Those who seek medical treatment can go to the Charity Association (address: Datong Road, Zhabei) or the fellow villagers association (address: opposite Xudong Lane, Tongyun Road) to obtain a free consultation coupon. Those who go to Mr. He for treatment will be given free consultations. The free consultation time is from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM every day.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Scientific Rainmaking vs. Setting Up an Altar to Pray for Rain <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Guiding Teacher:</p>
<p>I have a question that I would like you to answer. Although this is not a question from a textbook, it is closely related to our pursuit of knowledge. I think you will not be reluctant to teach, right?</p>
<p>According to reports, this year's heat has broken the record of the past sixty years. If it doesn't rain again, then the land will be scorched, and the drought will be very frightening.</p>
<p>China is a country that relies on the heavens for food. However, in recent years, the heavens have been making things difficult for her. Natural disasters and man-made calamities have followed one after another, so that people in power and the public have been busy praying to gods and Buddhas: When imperialism comes to invade, a Kalachakra Dharma Assembly is set up; when floods overflow, a Kalachakra Dharma Assembly is also set up; now, a drought has formed, and in addition to the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly, Zhang Tianshi is setting up an altar to pray for rain.</p>
<p>The concern of those in power and the public for the suffering of the people is something that I do not need to elaborate on. However, the question is: Is this kind of praying for rain helpful to the facts?</p>
<p>The 20th century is the age of science, not the age of theocracy. If rain can be prayed for, why would the heavens go to the trouble of creating such a drought? Moreover, Zhang Tianshi himself is a person who has a home but cannot return. Many of the followers of the Panchen Lama have died of heat in this hot weather. He cannot even protect himself, how can he protect others? Not long ago, scientific spirit mediums were discovered in the city. Everyone understands that this is a kind of superstition, somewhat close to spreading rumors to deceive the public. But isn't the current setting up of an altar to pray for rain better than scientific spirit mediums? Compared to the two, although the methods are different, the essence is the same. Why do people in society not only not expose its superstitious effect, but even praise it? Are they all deceived by the good-sounding term "praying for rain"?</p>
<p>It must be known that setting up an altar to pray for rain is just using the name to collect money. It is absolutely impossible to seek effectiveness. The hard-working people of the whole country, under the attack of heaven and man-made disasters, will only sit and wait for death if there is another drought. We can no longer be superstitious, we need scientific relief!</p>
<p>It is reported that Soviet Russia has invented a scientific method of praying for rain. If you know this method, I hope you will immediately disclose it, because although this will not immediately attract the attention of those in power and launch a large-scale scientific rainmaking experiment, it can somewhat give a considerable blow to some superstitious people and make the public know that only scientific rainmaking can save the drought, and all superstitions are deceptive!</p>
<p>I eagerly await a reply! Zhu Ming Chunqiu</p>

<p>—Original by Princess Der Ling, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because from childhood, she was assigned to be the wife of the son of the Empress Dowager's brother by her parents—that is, the Empress Dowager's nephew. Unexpectedly, when everything was ready and the wedding date was chosen, her fiancé suddenly died. According to the customs of the old Chinese era, although she had not had a real marital relationship with her fiancé, she still had to marry him and stay a widow for him, never thinking of marrying another person again. And the title of "Young Mistress Yuan" was ultimately added to her head! She was only a naive and lively little girl of eighteen at the time, but nominally, she had become a very bitter little widow in mourning! The cruelty of the old Chinese ethics is indeed an undeniable fact. When I met her in the palace, she was exactly twenty-four years old: but her demeanor was no different from that of an old woman in her forties or fifties. In her life, it can be said that there is no more happiness or joy! She was absolutely not allowed to talk to any man, nor could she laugh loudly casually; and she had to stay in the palace forever, until her soul left her body. But one thing was her fortune! That is, her nature was very stupid and taciturn, and she had almost no knowledge of life, so although her environment was so desolate and sad, she seemed not to feel it at all.</p>
<p>The other female officials were all girls from the close relatives of the emperor's surname, with nothing special to remember.</p>
<p>As for the duties we female officials undertook, it can be said that they were extremely easy. All our work was to serve the Empress Dowager: but we did not need to serve the Empress Dowager in matters such as dressing and combing her hair. We only took turns standing close to the Empress Dowager in pairs, and saying whatever came to mind, interesting words would do; but we all knew that it was very easy to get into trouble talking to the Empress Dowager, so we always let the Empress Dowager speak herself, but we pretended to listen with great interest, and carefully responded accordingly when she raised any questions.

<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>When the mercury on the thermometer stretches straight to the top, the house is really like a fire bucket, so hot and stuffy that you can't breathe. By evening, you can no longer be confined in the house, as if there is too little air in the house.</p>
<p>Going to the river has been our slogan for the past few days.</p>
<p>Whenever the sun is about to set, we always walk slowly with three people or two families across the streets of this small city to the open riverbank. At that time, some of the large ships have already turned on their lights, and the river water is usually calm, without wind or waves. The twilight clouds in the sky are also quiet, as if they have been tired after being steamed by the sun all day, and the fire snakes that flicker flicker in the cloud eyes, but there is no sound of electricity.</p>
<p>It is certainly not just our small group who are enjoying the wind on the river, but this beautiful scenery seems to be specially made for us. We talk and laugh, and it seems that the day's bitter heat has disappeared into thin air at this moment.</p>
<p>When the big ships have gone far away and the sky and the river can no longer be distinguished, we slowly walk back, but still looking back at the fishing fires on the riverbank, as if we are reluctant to leave. When will I be able to live by the river and not leave? I thought.</p>
<p>When I walk through the streets of the small city again, the women are sitting on the road, naked and wearing a small bib, waving a palm fan and teaching the children to sing the "Firefly" song.</p>
<p>"...Today poor, tomorrow poor, picking up gold turns into copper." The firefly song sung by the children is bitter.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Swimming and Ear Diseases <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>In hot weather, because people can't stand the heat, those who can swim will jump into the swimming pool or nearby waterways to swim. However, before entering the water, we must first have some common sense about swimming. Swimming in the swimming pool is most likely to cause problems with the ears, either because the pool water is turbid or because we don't pay enough attention after getting out of the water. The best method is to plug the ears before entering the water, and the most common thing to plug the ears with now is medicated cotton.</p>
<p>Now is the time for swimming, but we must know that the result of ordinary swimming, especially in turbid water, is most likely to cause ear ulcers. This kind of event may not necessarily happen in a swimming pool with perfect equipment and clean pool water, but people who have had ear ulcers are most likely to have them ulcerated again after swimming. Sometimes it will also affect the nasal passages, causing tonsillitis catarrh and other symptoms, especially after suffering from scarlet fever or similar diseases in early years, when the ears have had problems and have been cured, swimming in the water is most likely to cause ear disease to recur. However, healthy people will not develop diseases as a result of swimming.</p>
<p>Here, there is also a very important thing, which is that when swimming, jumping into the water from a high place, the transmission of the shock force, from the nostrils to the eardrums, will damage the eardrum. Moreover, some people say that according to the results of general research, when jumping into the water, landing feet first is more likely to be affected by the shock force than landing head first, like ordinary diving. Regarding this point, it may make people suspicious, but it is very obvious why the stimulation of water is more severe when jumping into the water than diving, because diving has the head blocking the nasal passages.</p>
<p>If we say that, is swimming not very easy to cause ear ulcers? However, we only need to consider in advance whether we have always had ear ulcers. If not, then it will definitely not ulcerate. Moreover, the preventive methods are now known to everyone. Just put medicated cotton in your ears before entering the water to swim, so that the ears will not be immersed in water and ulcerate.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirty-Two: The General Amuses Himself with Pleasure All Day Long; Few Soldiers Return Amidst the Weeping of Young and Old</p>
<p>The next day, the concubine went out to play mahjong. One of her trusted old maids went to the grain store across the street to buy some good glutinous rice to cook porridge for the Master. Seeing the back door open, she said, "Shopkeeper, do you have any empty rooms in this back courtyard?" As she spoke, she walked toward the back courtyard. Lady Jiang had spoken to her once before, so she welcomed her into the house and said, "Please sit down. Aren't you from the Master Commander's house across the street?" The old maid said, "Yes! Our concubine sees your house from the window upstairs every day. That young lady is..." Lady Jiang said, "That's my daughter." The old maid smiled and said, "Our concubine is also young and likes to make friends with young ladies. She saw your daughter and likes her very much, so she asked me to come over and invite your daughter to come over and play." Lady Jiang really didn't expect the Master Commander's concubine to want to befriend Guizhi, so she smiled and said, "Oh my! How dare we? Our child doesn't understand anything. How can she go to meet people? Don't let your concubine laugh at her." At this time, Guizhi was the most clear-headed. She thought about the Master Commander's two smiles when they met, which were definitely not unintentional. Now, this old maid's invitation was from the concubine to come over and play. She is such a noble person that the Master Commander has to put on a performance at home just to appease her little temper. Why would she want to connect with me, a poor woman? Putting these two situations together, she could tell that this matter was mostly fake, so she interjected in the house, "Thank her for me. I'm feeling very unwell today and can't go out." Although Lady Jiang felt it was a pity to give up this opportunity, her daughter's pregnancy was more important than connecting with the Master Commander. So, she didn't dare to force Guizhi to go and said to the old maid, "This child of mine really doesn't lie. If she says she can't go out, she definitely won't go out." The old maid smiled and said, "Could it be that your daughter thinks the concubine's invitation isn't good enough and wants the first wife to invite her? But our first wife doesn't live here. Where can we find the first wife?" (441)</p>

<p>— Cheng Zhao</p>
<p>A Mao is a new tea boy this semester. The Dean of Academic Affairs assigned him to serve students and teachers downstairs in the new building. He is very short and thin, with withered little hands and a sallow, bloodless face, obviously due to malnutrition. Usually, we can easily see him struggling to carry two buckets of washing water into the dormitory on his narrow shoulders. His swaying and trembling body is really pitiful.</p>
<p>Logically, children like A Mao should be sitting comfortably in the classroom, listening to lectures and being irrigated by the sweet dew of education. But his father is a carpenter, and the reward for his daily hard work can only barely maintain his own life. How can he afford to send A Mao to school? So A Mao was excluded from the gate of the university, selling his weak body to serve students and teachers, and he will be a tea boy for the rest of his life!</p>
<p>Sometimes, A Mao stands in front of our classroom, eagerly watching our happy situation in class. Sometimes, he stays at the window of the dormitory, watching our self-study life. He is so curious and envious that he forgets his duties and is scolded by the Dean of Academic Affairs.</p>
<p>On the eve of the graduation exam, just as the students were working hard to prepare for their lessons, there was suddenly a disturbance. It was said that the little tea boy, A Mao, had been scalded by boiling water. When we went to see, he had already been carried to the hospital by the school workers, leaving only a large pile of muddy water by the fence of the playground!</p>

<h3 id="e229">Gua Sha (Skin Scraping) <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yian</p>
<p>Gua Sha, this seems to be a not very civilized medical technique, but the experience of facts makes me have to adopt it.</p>
<p>I used to know and not believe that Gua Sha and other medical techniques would have any effect, and I was a little disgusted. The most important reason why I hated Gua Sha was seeing the red and black streaks all over the bodies of people who had been scraped, on their eyebrows, necks, chests, and backs.</p>
<p>Since that year, about six years ago, which was the year I started playing with photography, I tried the taste of Gua Sha. At that time, I had just learned to develop and print photos myself, so I filled a pavilion room as a darkroom. The summer light is the most convenient season for photography. Every day, the sunshine time is extended, and the light is particularly strong. You can also use a high-speed shutter to capture very high-speed movements without worrying about insufficient exposure. But this season is the most unsuitable for developing and printing, because the temperature is high, and there is often a risk of film melting, and working in a closed pavilion darkroom in the hot summer is not a very comfortable thing. My darkroom has a cement flat top on the upper level and a kitchen below. At noon, the strong sun bakes the cement top layer hot, and the kitchen below is cooking. As a rule, it is not allowed to work under such circumstances. However, I, who had just learned to develop and print, was extremely enthusiastic. Not to mention such weather, I would do it even in Africa, as long as there was a way to keep the film from melting.</p>
<p>One day, two days, three days, after working in the darkroom like this, I felt something different in my body: the joints of my shoulders, elbows, and knees felt like they were being pressed by thousands of pounds of weight; my eyelids also felt like they had hooks on them, and it was very difficult to open them. My head felt empty; my tongue felt tasteless when I ate because it had a coating. I just wanted to sleep, and I still didn't want to open my eyes when I woke up. I told my wife about my symptoms, and my wife said that I had heatstroke. So, ten drops of medicine water, Shanjii Pills, and other things were taken out and used.</p>
<p>Ten drops of medicine water are suitable for emergencies. This is not an emergency, and I don't feel anything after taking it. I feel a little better in my stomach after taking Pujii Pills, but my eyelids are still heavy, and my joints are still sore. This went on for two or three days, and I didn't eat for two or three days.</p>
<p>"Let's try Gua Sha," my wife suggested. Sister Xu, a female worker from Yangzhou, immediately agreed.</p>
<p>Although I have always hated Gua Sha, I couldn't resist their repeated encouragement and the oppression of pain, so I finally hardened my heart and gave it a try.</p>
<p>The equipment and medicines used for Gua Sha are very simple: a cup of hot water or hot tea, a spoon, or a copper coin. Tea water can sometimes be replaced by raw oil, and copper coins and spoons can be replaced by thin jade pieces such as jade earrings.</p>
<p>The person who gave me Gua Sha asked me to strip naked, and she wet the copper coin in hot water and started scraping. First, start from the back. You have to sit down and bend your back. In order to support the weight of your upper body, your hands naturally press on your knees. The first few scrapes don't feel like much, but if you really have "sha", then after a few scrapes you will feel a kind of bone-piercing pain. It is said that that is when the "sha" comes out. When the "sha" comes out, the skin starts to turn red. If the "sha" is heavy, the color will not only turn red, but also form purple-black blisters. From the spine, to the shoulders, to the arm bends, to the eyebrows. For the eyebrows, don't scrape the surface, but pull it. When I had Gua Sha for the first time, I jumped up in pain and almost couldn't finish it. But after the scraping, all the pain in your body disappeared immediately. Although this thing seems uncivilized, you can't help but believe it. After this time, because of my excessive enthusiasm for photography in those two years, I had to scrape several times every summer.</p>
<p>I can't explain with science why Gua Sha can cure heatstroke, but I have gained my factual belief.</p>

<p>丨 Schools Not Approved for Establishment and Unregistered Schools Should Also Not Be Applied to</p>
<p>Universities and Colleges Should Not Enroll Students Promoted from Unregistered Secondary Schools</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 24th) The Ministry of Education ordered various departments and bureaus, saying that students must not apply to private schools that have not been approved for establishment and are unregistered, and universities and colleges must not enroll transfer students from unregistered universities and colleges, and students promoted from unregistered secondary schools. This has been repeatedly ordered and announced in various cases. Recently, it has been reported that graduates of unregistered senior high schools can still apply for further education first, which is obviously contrary to the methods set by the Ministry. In order to avoid misunderstandings, the previous order is hereby reiterated that the schools must not enroll transfer students from unregistered universities and colleges and students promoted from unregistered secondary schools. If they violate the order and enroll again, the Ministry will not recognize them. They are hereby ordered to transfer the order to provincial and registered private universities and colleges to strictly comply.</p>

<p>A public letter from the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau states: "I hereby inform you that the regulations for private schools have been revised and promulgated by the Ministry of Education. According to the revised regulations for private schools, the procedures for applying for registration are divided into only three types: (1) the founder submits an application to the school board for registration; (2) reports the opening of the school; (3) applies for school registration, etc., which is slightly simpler than before. However, newly established private schools must follow the provisions of Article 26, Paragraph 1 of the regulations: 'Schools must not enroll students before being approved to open by the competent education administrative authority.' In the future, if there are newly established schools, they must be approved to open by the bureau before they can enroll students. A copy of the revised regulations for private schools is enclosed for your reference."</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 24th) Representatives of students and workers of Peking University went to the Executive Yuan on the 24th to receive instructions. Chu Minyi brought out a batch of documents saying that all the submitted documents had been seen and that the Ministry of Education had been ordered to review and reply, and to transfer them to the Examination Yuan for detailed discussion of the measures. The representatives then went to the Ministry of Education to await a reply. Lei Zhen received them and replied, saying that this matter had been discussed repeatedly by President Wang, President Wang, and various ministers, and it was decided to take three measures: (1) A national student work advisory office will be established in the autumn of this year, which will be engaged in registration, investigation, and introduction; (2) Contact the Examination Yuan to hold examinations; (3) The Executive Yuan will also find ways to employ them. The representatives declared that the work had come to an end. Except for one or two people staying in Beijing, the rest returned to Peking University that night.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Ministry of Education Orders Attention to the Reporting of Staff and Student Rosters <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities on the 23rd, stating that Articles 9 to 12 of the Secondary School Regulations, Articles 12 to 15 of the Normal School Regulations, and Articles 15 and 16 of the Vocational School Regulations all have clear provisions regarding the timely reporting of various matters related to teachers, students, school funding budgets, school rules, school buildings, and equipment. At present, among the rosters of public and private secondary schools submitted to the Ministry by the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, there are quite a few that conform to the regulations, but there are more that do not conform to the regulations. It is very difficult to review them. In addition to the styles of rosters for the various matters that schools should report, which will be revised and promulgated separately, the following special regulations are made for the points that are most easily overlooked and erroneous in the staff and student rosters reported by the schools, so that they can be followed.</p>
<p>(1) The principals and directors should be in charge of teaching and should not receive separate salaries. The rosters should indicate the departments and years of service, as well as the subjects and hours currently taught.</p>
<p>(2) The directors of moral education, citizenship, or party doctrine teachers should be employed by those who have passed the examination or review. The rosters should indicate the time of examination or review and the certificate number.</p>
<p>(3) Teachers of each subject should be hired as much as possible by those who specialize in that subject. The rosters should indicate the departments they have studied, the number of years they have been teachers, and their teaching performance.</p>
<p>(4) The calculation methods for student grades should be handled separately in accordance with the regulations. The graduation examination results should be handled separately in accordance with the graduation examination regulations for secondary school normal students. The rosters should indicate the calculation process and results. (5) The start and end times and names of academic years should be handled in accordance with the school's calendar. For example, those after August 22 should be called the first semester of the 22nd academic year, and those after February 23 should be called the second semester of the 22nd academic year. They should not be arbitrarily named, so as not to violate the regulations.</p>
<p>(6) Some schools are only now reporting the rosters for the 19th academic year, which is too late. They should quickly submit all subsequent academic year rosters to make them complete. From the 23rd academic year onwards, they must follow the regulations and not delay.</p>
<p>The above are all the matters that schools should pay attention to when handling rosters. The departments are instructed to follow them. At the same time, the departments should also pay attention to the following points when submitting the rosters of various schools.</p>
<p>(1) If the rosters reported by various schools do not conform to the above items, they should be rejected immediately. If there are special circumstances that allow for appropriate changes, they should also add specific notes for review. They should not be transferred hastily before the department has carefully reviewed them.</p>
<p>(2) Attention should be paid to the number of teachers and students, the number of students in each grade, the teaching subjects, and the allocation of funds. If there is any non-compliance, it should be corrected at any time.</p>
<p>(3) The staff and student rosters of private secondary schools that have not been filed with the Ministry should not be transferred by the departments. If the junior high school has been filed but the senior high school has not been filed, the junior high school part should be reviewed and transferred, and the senior high school part should be returned. If the teachers and staff of the senior and junior high schools cannot be divided, the junior high school part should be re-created and submitted.</p>
<p>(4) When the departments transfer the various rosters of various schools, they should submit them directly to the Ministry without having to submit them to the provincial and municipal governments for consultation, in order to speed up the process. If it is necessary to submit them to the provincial and municipal governments for filing, they can also be submitted separately at the same time.</p>
<p>The investigation and reporting of rosters by various schools is extremely important. The education administrative authorities can know a glimpse of their handling status based on the rosters reported by the schools. Among the schools, there are those whose reported rosters can still barely meet the requirements, but the content of the handling is not completely consistent. If the reported rosters are already wrong, it is rare to expect them to be handled legally. In the future, if the departments find that the rosters reported by various schools are still in compliance with the regulations, they should not regard them as sufficient. They should still pay attention to whether the actual situation of each school is consistent with the reported rosters. The rosters sent by each school should be checked against the reports provided by the supervisors of the department from time to time to facilitate supervision. If any non-compliance is found in the rosters sent by each school, they should be ordered to be changed immediately, and attention should be paid to the actual situation of the school at any time to urge improvement. It should be known that although there are many reasons for the success or failure of schools, they are generally related to whether the allocation of funds is appropriate, whether the hiring of teachers is appropriate, whether the moral education is carried out appropriately, and whether the management of students is conscientious. Now that various regulations have been promulgated, there are standards to follow for how schools should be run. The departments bear the heavy responsibility of organizing local education. The review of school rosters is a preliminary work of a universal nature and must be strictly followed. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Three Provincial Headquarters Advocate Production Education <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>All Ordinary Schools Should Implement the Half-Farming and Half-Studying Doctrine</p>
<p>Regulations for Implementation are Issued to the Three Provincial Governments for Compliance</p>
<p>(Hankou Communication) In order to implement the production of education, the Commander-in-Chief of the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has formulated measures and issued instructions to the three provincial governments on the 23rd, ordering the two departments of construction and education to strictly comply. In general, ordinary schools in various places should formulate education policies separately by administrative organs and education organs, according to the needs of the local area and the personality and family status of the students. The general principle is to pay attention to the production of education. The implementation methods are as follows: (1) Each school must set up a school garden, supervise students to cultivate various crops by themselves, practice on the spot, and may set up agricultural farms or forestry and animal husbandry farms by using the organization of cooperatives, with teachers and staff leading students to plant and raise livestock, and implement the doctrine of half-farming and half-study. All income, except for expenses and payment for the purchase or lease of land, may be distributed to teachers and students to encourage them. (2) Each school must set up a specimen room, lead students to collect local artificial and natural products, and display them for observation. (3) Add various cooperative knowledge to the citizenship course, add local products and methods to be improved to the geography course, add various knowledge of agriculture, forestry, sericulture, chicken raising, pig raising, and bee raising and improve skills to the natural course, and add methods to improve local industries and manufacture products for sale to the physics and chemistry and manual courses to promote them. (4) Advocate diligence and simplicity, cultivate the atmosphere of enduring hardship and not using school servants. (5) Local administrative organs and education organs must run at least one vocational school according to local needs, so that the school is industrialized, the students are apprentices, and the career is socialized. Based on this principle, the implementation methods must achieve the following items: A. The teaching materials used must be divided into two categories: one, taken from the local area; two, taken from other places, using scientific methods to compare the strengths and weaknesses and teach at the school to improve them. B. The practice time must be more than double the lecture time to cultivate the technology of all-round hands. C. During each semester, teachers and students must go to various places in groups once or twice to give tours and lectures, and guide farmers or workers on the spot with the results of their practice in order to improve operations.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Du Yannian's Speech at the Capital Women's Political and Legal Institute <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>The Illiterate Laborer Wang Fengyi Founded 500 Women's Schools</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st, the Capital Women's Political and Legal Institute specially invited Mr. Du Yannian, Director-General of the Beijing Universal Morality Society, and Mr. Gao Pengjiu to give lectures. First, Ms. Liu Linghua introduced the recent developments in the East Asian women's rights movement, which are advancing rapidly. In Japan, a female farmer named Misuko founded the Tenrikyo Church, which already has more than six million followers. They are spreading their teachings in various countries around the world, with women accounting for the majority, while men are passively assisting. A few days ago, the head of the church, Masayoshi Nakayama, came to Shanghai and visited various girls' schools in Xujiahui, which was praised as extraordinary by both Chinese and Westerners. However, they were unaware that China also has an extraordinary figure who founded five or six hundred women's schools, namely Mr. Du Yanping and Mr. Wang Fengyi, the Director-General of the Universal Morality Society. Mr. Du is not so surprising, but what is surprising is that the only mentor of the society, Wang Fengyi, is an illiterate laborer who was able to found five or six hundred women's schools. This is truly a great light in China's women's rights movement and a precursor to global female harmony, which is unique in the world. Therefore, we specially introduce her to our school, so that we can connect with the brilliance of the practitioners of the Universal Morality Society.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Du spoke about how the society was founded in Shandong in the tenth year of the Republic by the prodigy Jiang Xizhang. In Jiang's vernacular interpretations of the Four Books, he often praised Mr. Liu Renhang's method of transforming families into villages, so they have known each other for a long time. This time he came to Shanghai to conclude the handling of the Shandong Yellow River flood disaster and was able to meet Mr. Liu. Now, with his introduction, I will report on the work of our society over the past ten years. In recent years, because the prodigy Jiang has often been abroad, Mr. Wang Fengyi, our mentor, and I have been handling everything. We are greatly inspired by Mr. Wang's spirit. Mr. Wang has no other strengths, but he is a poor man from Chaoyang, Rehe. He worked as a hired laborer when he was young and is illiterate. However, after being ill for twelve years, he suddenly heard someone preaching the section on Shuangguan Gao from "Picking Up the Lost," and his illness was cured. The reason was that his family was arguing, and each member, including the grandparents and daughters-in-law, repented and reunited. Mr. Wang thus realized the method of repenting with a clear conscience to cure illness. After he was cured, he went everywhere to persuade people to cure illness, not by using spells, but by directly pointing to their original heart. As a result, thousands of people were cured, and it became popular in the three northeastern provinces. Mr. Wang also made a vow to help virtuous people with chivalry and to sacrifice his life to save virtuous friends. After making this vow, he unexpectedly saw the world illuminated in the middle of the night and realized the great way. However, Mr. Wang's realization is very special. He realized that the root cause of social chaos lies not only in national politics but must start from transforming the family, and not only in men but also in women and children. Therefore, he never runs schools for boys or universities but specializes in running elementary schools for girls to cultivate motherly education as the foundation of everything. He also uses his special inspirational power to persuade women to manage their families harmoniously, treat their parents-in-law and sisters-in-law well, and teach their children well. If the family is at peace, the men will naturally be good. Mr. Wang is illiterate, but whenever families in various provinces have difficulties, if they ask our society to send someone to persuade them, the problems will be resolved. This is all due to Mr. Wang's special inspirational power. Therefore, the work done by our society is purely based on foolish sincerity, practicing the feminine way of gentleness and inspiration, and has no other strengths. This is very different from the modern emphasis on improving women's rights but focusing on equal distribution of inheritance, etc. Currently, our society has cultivated 160,000 women and has run three or four hundred elementary schools in the Guandong region and one or two hundred in Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces, all using this method. I also have no knowledge or academic expertise to lecture, but I am just reporting what we have practiced for the public's reference. Practitioners will definitely not look down on women and children, and they will practice female gentleness to inspire men to be upright. The way is very easy. Everyone must know that although there are many people in the world, they are only men and women. Using male force to control men is not as easy as using female gentleness to transform them. This is what our mentor Wang has personally experienced and practiced. His ideas can be considered a practical and effective implementation of Mr. Liu's advocacy of female harmony. This is a special report. The audience applauded enthusiastically. Next, Mr. Gao from the society spoke. I have served in the military and political circles for many years and have been the head of various counties in Jiangsu and Shaanxi. At first, I thought that having power would definitely lead to success, but later I realized that having power does not necessarily have practical results. Therefore, I realized the importance of Taoist transformation. Currently, our society is developing industries in the Northwest to support the poor. Due to time constraints, I will not say more.</p>
<p>Next, Ms. Huang Dianhua spoke. I have been running schools for girls and boys of all levels for many years. However, I am deeply interested in Mr. Wang's natural awakening to transform society, with an emphasis on women and children, which is something that the general public has not thought of. Your society practices using female harmony to transform male strength, which truly confirms Mr. Liu's theory of female harmony. In addition, I also have a new economic policy to assist moral transformation, which I will discuss in detail another day.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Tong Boting, the director of the Capital Women's Political and Legal Institute, expressed his gratitude, and the meeting ended happily.</p>

<p>Grass Tennis League Championship: China vs. Inside and Outside Factories Today</p>
<p>The Championship's Fate Hangs in the Balance; 5 PM at the Inside and Outside Factories</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grass Doubles Tennis League will conclude after today's matches. The China Club is currently in second place with 79 points, just one point behind the French Business Club's 80. However, based on their actual strength, the Japan Club initially showed great momentum, but after last week's major defeat, it has become exhausted and cannot compete with others. The fiercest competition with the China Club is with the French Business Club, but their match against the Japan Club today is unlikely to be optimistic. The China Club has arranged its best lineup to deal with the Inside and Outside Factories, hoping to win a major victory and consecutively win the championship. The following players are expected to appear on time. Those who can go directly to the venue are allowed to gather at the China Eastern Company at 4:45 PM and depart together. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>First Group: Lin Baohua, Zheng Zhaojia</p>
<p>Second Group: Qiu Feihai, Liang Deguang</p>
<p>Third Group: Wang Wenzheng, Yu Tianguang</p>
<p>Fourth Group: Dun Yujie, Ma Anquan</p>
<p>Fifth Group: Zhang Dingzhao, Zhou Guanjun</p>
<h3 id="e244">Today's Schedule <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>This year's league is coming to a successful conclusion, with only the final match today remaining. The China Club will face the Inside and Outside Factories, while the French Business Club will face the Japan Club. If the China Club's performance is just two points better than the French Business Club's against the Japan Club, the China Club will win the championship consecutively. Given the strength and lineup of the China Club today, it is possible for the China Club to win against the Inside and Outside Factories. However, the Inside and Outside players are soft on the outside but tough on the inside, so we cannot be overly optimistic. But it is not easy for the French Business Club to win by a large margin against the Japan Club. The China Club only won against them by nine to six. Therefore, based on the facts, the China Club has great hope. The schedule for the final four matches today is as follows:</p>
<p>China Club vs. Inside and Outside Factories at the Inside and Outside Factories</p>
<p>French Business Club vs. Japan Club at the Japan Tennis Club</p>
<p>Portugal vs. North Grassland at the Portuguese Club</p>
<p>South Grassland vs. Xiejiao Club at the Racecourse</p>

<p>In this year's league championship, the competition between the China Tennis Club and the French Business Club has become a very interesting and attention-grabbing center. After the French Business Club exceeded the China Tennis Club by four points, the China Tennis Club quickly caught up. After last week's match, the China Club won against North Grassland by fourteen to one, while the French Business Club won against South Grassland by thirteen to two, thus catching up by one point, only three points behind. After last week's match, China won completely over South Grassland, while the French only won over North Grassland by 13 to 2, therefore the current situation is China only lags behind French by one point. The current scores of each team are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name Matches Played Wins Losses Points</p>
<p>French Business Club 105 80 25 80</p>
<p>China Club 105 79 26 79</p>

<p>Seeking to Advance the Overall Physical Education School Enterprise</p>
<p>When the Southeast Women's Physical Education Normal School in Jiangwan hosted a banquet for its graduates last month, it specially invited the principals and responsible persons of various men's and women's physical education schools in Shanghai to gather at Taolechun. At that time, Mr. Yu Ziyu instructed Ms. Zhang Shaojin to formally mention in her speech that "physical education schools in Shanghai have been established, but there is no connection between them, which hinders the development of the physical education enterprise. It would be best to have an organization for a physical education school federation to facilitate progress." The leaders of the schools present were all moved and nodded in agreement. It is reported that this organization has obtained the consent of most physical education schools and is in the process of being formally established, and it may soon become a reality. The scattered nature of physical education schools in Shanghai, with each school governing itself, is contrary to the overall policy of promoting national health. Fortunately, everyone has realized the necessity of this type of organization. In view of the education authorities' advocacy of national health movement, we feel even more that physical education schools, which bear practical responsibility, should have a backbone role. This kind of connection, in addition to the individual development of each school, seeks to connect and advance the overall enterprise, which is both necessary and essential.</p>

<p>— Comberdo</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Mr. Liu Bannong suddenly passed away, and the academic community has lost another person. This is something to be regretted. But I know nothing about ancient phonology, so I am not qualified to say a word of praise or criticism. Instead, I am reminded of another matter. When the current vernacular was about to be "abandoned" or "despised," he was also a great "head-on attacker" of the current vernacular, especially the Europeanized vernacular.</p>
<p>He once had a brilliant article that was effortless but very powerful:</p>
<p>"I will now give a simple example:</p>
<p>Confucius said: 'To learn and constantly practice it, is that not a pleasure?'</p>
<p>This is too old-fashioned, not good! 'To learn and constantly practice it,' Confucius said, 'is that not a pleasure?'</p>
<p>This is good!</p>
<p>'To learn and constantly practice it,' 'Is that not a pleasure?' Confucius said. This is even better! Why is it good? It's Europeanized. But 'Confucius said' ultimately could not be Europeanized to 'Said Confucius'!"</p>
<p>This passage appears in "A General Theory of Chinese Grammar," which is a serious book. The author was also a colleague of "New Youth," a fighter of the "Literary Revolution" in the May Fourth era, and now he has become an ancient person. According to the old Chinese custom, death can often increase value, so I would like to bring it up again and point out that he was also a colleague of the "Analects" Society and sometimes could not help but make some "jokes." Originally, he also had "humor," but these "jokes" often fell into the gutter of "joking."</p>
<p>The actual example is the article quoted above. In fact, that argument is no different from the words of stubborn gentlemen and street rascals who, when they see young people wearing foreign clothes and learning foreign languages, sneer and say, "It's a pity that your nose is still low and your face is not white."</p>
<p>Naturally, what Mr. Liu opposed was "too Europeanized." But what is the scope of "too"? The first three methods he cited do not exist in classical Chinese, but they can exist in conversations and can be understood by people. Only changing "Confucius said" to "Said Confucius" is definitely incomprehensible. However, he could not find a real example in the Europeanized articles he opposed, so he had to say that "'Confucius said' ultimately could not be Europeanized to 'Said Confucius'!" Isn't this "shooting at a target that isn't there?"</p>
<p>The main reason for the intrusion of Europeanized grammar into Chinese vernacular is not because of curiosity but because of necessity. National essence scholars hate foreign airs, but when they live in the concession, they will write strange place names like "Avenue Joffre" and "Avenue Haig." It is not that the commentators want to be strange, but to be precise, the existing vernacular is not enough, so they have to adopt some foreign syntax. It is true that it is relatively difficult to understand, unlike tea and rice that can be swallowed in one gulp, but the compensation for this shortcoming is precision. Mr. Hu Shi's "Ibsenism," published in "New Youth," is indeed easier to understand than some recent literary essays, but don't we feel that it is also superficial and vague?</p>
<p>If those who ridicule the Europeanized vernacular, in addition to ridiculing, try to introduce foreign precision works without arbitrarily changing or deleting them, I think they will still be able to give us better advice.</p>
<p>Using jokes to deal with enemies is naturally also a good tactic, but the point of contact must be the opponent's fatal wound. Otherwise, a joke is just a joke.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Dispersing Melancholy <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>These past few days, Shanghai has been extremely bustling. Christians are praying to God, Buddhists are chanting scriptures, and Taoists naturally have to join in the fun. So they invited Zhang Ruiling, the 63rd-generation ancestral master from Longhu Mountain in Jiangxi, to set up an altar and perform rituals to eliminate disasters and pray for rain. The Living Buddha has just left, and now the Heavenly Master has arrived. If China is to face any more so-called disasters, only Heaven knows what will happen.</p>
<p>But disasters certainly exist. Let's not even talk about the political and economic ones; even the farmers, who depend solely on agriculture for their livelihoods, are suffering. A bumper harvest can become a disaster—this was the experience of last year. In the past, when the rice was about to ripen, one only needed to inquire at the teahouses in town to find out if any neighboring counties were experiencing famine. Then, whether you were Uncle Nine-Catty or Auntie Seven-Catty, you could predict the price of grain. But this hasn't been the case in recent years. There's drought in the Northwest and major flooding in the Yangtze River. Grain prices should be high, right? But the opposite is true. Even the predictions of rice merchants who are familiar with the national situation have fallen flat. The reason is that there's Siam in the South, Taiwan in the East, India in the West, and steamships crossing the Pacific Ocean. These places all produce rice and can freely transport it to China.</p>
<p>As a result, foreign rice floods the market, and rural areas go bankrupt. This has also become a disaster. The Living Buddha and the Heavenly Master certainly have no "magic" to dispel it, and the philanthropists haven't even thought about it.</p>
<p>However, the farmers are certainly not lacking in benevolence. Didn't Nanjing have a financial conference? The aim was to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes and not increase land taxes. It hasn't been long since we remember that. But what is the actual situation? Taking my hometown as an example, the collection is divided into two installments. The regular tax is four national currency units per mu (approximately 1/6 of an acre). In the first installment, surcharges such as the construction special levy, construction surcharge, special levy collection surcharge, autonomous surcharge, education surcharge, pest control expenses, and collection fee amount to a total surcharge of one yuan and forty-seven cents and nine li (one-tenth of a cent) per yuan. In the second installment, surcharges such as the construction special levy, special levy collection surcharge, construction surcharge, surcharge collection surcharge, pest control expenses, party fee surcharge, vocational training institute expenses, and collection fee amount to a total surcharge of nine dimes and five cents and six li per yuan. That is to say, for every yuan paid in regular tax each year, you still have to pay two yuan and forty-three cents and five li in surcharges. However, compared to last year, this has already been reduced by a few cents, showing that it has been affected by the financial conference after all. But the exception is that this year there is also a so-called surveying and mapping fee of twenty-five cents per mu. The land has not yet been surveyed, but the expenses have already been collected in advance. Just as a few cents are reduced, several dimes are added. Their skin and flesh are already gone; the farmers' spines will probably be broken to be sold as firewood.</p>
<p>This has naturally become another disaster. The Living Buddha remains indifferent, the Heavenly Master silent, and everyone is ultimately speechless.</p>
<p>But Shanghai is bustling after all. Gentlemen shed a few more drops of sweat, and then drought became a disaster. Living Buddhas, priests, Heavenly Masters, ascended the altar and sat in their seats, praying devoutly, and sweet rain indeed fell generously, although it is not known whose merit it was.</p>
<p>After the rain, the air is newly cool, and the gentlemen nod to each other and say, "It's so refreshing! It's not at all gloomy these days."</p>
<p>But the gloom still exists, just like the disaster. It is hidden in another group of people.</p>
<h3 id="e261">The Contradiction Between Morality and Writing <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Dun Pang</p>
<p>Anecdotes from the Qing Dynasty Literary Scene, Part 3</p>
<p>Wang Xizhuang (Wusheng) had not yet passed his examinations and was tutoring in a wealthy family's home. Every time he entered the house, he would make a gesture of scooping up something with both hands. When people asked him about it, he said, "I want to scoop the wealth and prosperity of this family into my own embrace." After he became an official, he engaged in deception and misappropriation, taking many things for himself. When people asked him, "Sir, you are rich in learning, yet you are so greedy and stingy. Are you not afraid of how posterity will view your reputation?" He replied, "Greed and stinginess are only temporary ridicule, while learning is a legacy for a thousand years. I am confident that my literary fame can be passed down through the ages. A hundred years from now, word-of-mouth reputation will have faded, but my writings will still exist. My morality and writing will still be there." Therefore, his writings are full of passionate and stirring words, which were meant to conceal his greed and vulgarity.</p>
<p>Note: This excerpt is enough to prove the greatness of literature, and also enough to prove the freedom of literature. A greedy and vulgar person can use his writing to express his lofty morality a hundred years later—this is the greatness. A greedy and vulgar person can create passionate and stirring writing, which shows that there is no relationship between character and literature, let alone economic conditions and class consciousness—this is the freedom. However, conversely, it is inevitable that people feel "disillusioned." If the literati of the past were like this, then can we really trust the literati of today who write elegant or revolutionary words—can we really trust their elegance and revolution? Morality and writing are often contradictory, and examples abound.</p>
<h3 id="e262">The Mountain Hermit Who Helps Out <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Dun Li</p>
<p>Anecdotes from the Qing Dynasty Literary Scene, Part 4</p>
<p>Chen Meigong encountered an official at the home of Wang Jingshi, who asked Jingshi, "Who is this person?" Jingshi said, "A mountain hermit." The official said, "If he is a mountain hermit, why doesn't he go to the mountains?" He was mocking him for being under the patronage of a nobleman. Soon they sat down at the table, and the official gave an order, "First, a black name; second, two sentences from the Four Books; and last, a line from a drama that fits the meaning." The official first cited, "Ten sisters married eight brothers; eight mouths can be free from hunger; but who will the two daughters rely on?" Meigong said, "The painted-browed thrush has married the white-haired old man; I am old and cannot use it; I have wasted my youthful years." The whole assembly praised him, and the official then became friends with him. Jiang Chaosheng, a compiler from Qianshan, wrote a play called "The Dream of Linchuan" with a scene called "Hidden Treachery," intentionally vilifying Meigong. His entrance poem says, "Decorating the mountains and forests with great pretension, attached to elegance, a minor celebrity. Without trying to take the Zhongnan shortcut, he boasts of being a recluse to an extreme degree. Using the sacrifices to otters to fill his writings, busily flies around cauldrons and tripods to moisten the mists and clouds. Lightly, a cloud crane, flies back and forth, rushing to the Prime Minister." It is also mocking and abusive.</p>
<p>Note: This excerpt can be compared with the previous excerpt. Many people today admire the temperament and style of the literati of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, but they do not realize that the mountain hermits and celebrities of that time were nothing more than helpers of the nobles. Nobles cannot do without this kind of person, so although the official initially mocked Meigong, he eventually "became friends with him." And this kind of person cannot become a mountain hermit and celebrity without leaving the nobleman, so Meigong was mocked but did not take offense, and he also eventually "became friends with him." Jiang Xinyu exposed the ugliness of the "celebrities" who were "attached to elegance," and some people think it is mocking and abusive, but who knows that they themselves do not care at all? But those who are attached to elegance today do not actually not know these situations, but they are just such people themselves.</p>

<p>— Sheng Maliang</p>
<p>The gentle sunlight bathes the morning of Lake Biwa.</p>
<p>A small boat floats in the tranquil lake, and my mood is as calm as the lake water.</p>
<p>Yinzi and I are often intoxicated here, with such a gentle breeze and such a quiet reflection on the waves...</p>
<p>The light boat glides slowly on the tranquil lake, are the tones of the waves the poetic intent forgotten by poets?</p>
<p>Beautiful cloud shadows drift lightly by, and Yinzi's memories bring up old dreams of her hometown: the sky in Pyongyang also has such light cloud shadows!</p>
<p>Oh, young man! You, will you recall your hometown in China?</p>
<p>Oh!...</p>
<p>Sadness is hidden in the faint dimples of her smile. The two of us are both people adrift in foreign lands. Oh, Yinzi, you are like a drop of dew on a duckweed!</p>
<p>(Forget it! That desolate hometown!)</p>
<p>Silently plucking the strings of my mandolin, the wanderer sings a wandering song:</p>
<p>"The old ripples only reflect the old dreams,</p>
<p>The wanderer only sings the wandering song,</p>
<p>Oh, the returning swallow, does it bring a gentle breeze from the old land?</p>
<p>Stop recalling the vanished rose-colored dreams,</p>
<p>Oh, how many times have I wandered!</p>
<p>The moonlight of the old land is vaguely hazy..."</p>
<p>My heart is like a quiet ripple. A white gull swoops past, and ripples stir again.</p>
<p>On the distant shore of the lake, a young Japanese girl walks by. Her fluttering clothes are so light and carefree in the shadow of the wind!</p>
<p>Silently, Yinzi leans in my arms, telling of the sadness of wandering. The emotions of a traveler are so poignant!</p>
<p>A white flower is tied in Yinzi's hair, and a fragrance drifts in the wind.</p>
<p>Three years have passed.</p>
<p>Now, the old shadows of Lake Biwa are faint, but the life of the past three years has flowed like mud, and there has been no news of Yinzi!</p>
<p>The wanderer's heart stirs with even deeper pain. Oh, life is just a dream. Silently, the mandolin strings play mournful sounds. Sing, let the lost youth live as an old dream in the shadows of memories!</p>
<p>"Stop recalling the vanished rose-colored dreams,</p>
<p>Oh, how many times have I wandered!</p>
<p>The moonlight of the old land is vaguely hazy..." (June, 1934)</p>

<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Watermelons as big as human heads are carried in baskets to the homes of the privileged. The watermelons are frozen at the bottom of the refrigerator, and the electric fan blows like a cold north wind. The maids, dripping with sweat, bring out the watermelons. Slicing watermelons is always easier than killing heads. The master, madam, young miss, and young master all come together, everyone eats watermelon and leans back on the sofa.</p>
<p>X X X,</p>
<p>If watermelons also had mouths, they could say a lot of complaining words: "The countryside gives me life, the city squeezes me dry. Those who give me life, year after year, don't know how much blood and sweat they've shed; those who squeeze me dry, on such hot days, I don't see a single bead of sweat on them. Each of us is like a human head, killing us is more terrible than killing human heads."</p>

<p>— Xingye</p>
<p>Most of the women can ride wild horses, and most of the men know how to use guns. They are more straightforward than the Americans in the East, more revolutionary, and love adventure and resistance. After the Indians were eliminated, they used the method of overcoming foreign races to overcome the oppression of nature. Railways were built; minerals were developed; canals, dams, roads, and underground oil pipelines all quickly appeared in this barren area. And the construction projects seen in this area, such as the Hoover Dam and the border dams, can best represent the vigorous vitality of the American nation.</p>
<p>As the car drove further, approaching the Rocky Mountains, the desert nature of the fields became more and more severe. The mountain slopes are made up of yellow ash soil. Whenever a strong wind passes, yellow sand flies down from the mountains in heavy clouds. The air is so dry that I feel like I am traveling below the pyramids of Egypt. The moist winds of the Pacific Ocean cannot blow here because they are blocked by the mountains, and this place is far from the Gulf of Mexico. Although there are a few farmlands in the sand dunes, they can only grow barley and rye. Mexicans, wearing wide-brimmed straw hats and riding breeches with large legs, often appear in the wilderness. They still retain some of the manners of ancient Spanish knights and the hereditary blood of red Indians. Their rough and dark faces, paired with hard and black beards, sing Mexican love songs with great satisfaction. The southwestern provinces of the United States were originally taken from the hands of the Mexicans, so there are still many Mexicans living in the southwest of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>Although the Rocky Mountains are tall, their scenery is far less beautiful than Yandang Mountain in eastern Zhejiang. The eastern foot of the mountains is very simple and straight. The pine trees are lined up like electric poles, without any twists and turns. Several very sharp mountain peaks are still covered with white snow, like white hats. Although there are large streams under the mountains, I have not seen a single beautiful waterfall along the way. The car turned on the top of the mountain for several hours, slowly taking me to the western foot of the Rocky Mountains. The air here is very clear, and in this May weather, the green forest covers everything on the mountain. The car route winds through the green shade, and red houses can be seen vaguely along the road, most of which are wealthy people's summer villas. Within ten miles of Salt Lake City, everything contains fresh poetry. A large group of sheep slowly came along the foot of the mountain, facing the car. The driver had to stop and let the sheep squeeze past the car, rubbing against it. When the sunset had filled the mountains, the cherry trees in the mountains, the small lake under the trees, and the white geese swimming on the lake were in harmony with each other. Salt Lake City is built in the mountains. The streets are very clean and wide. The cleanliness and tidiness of the buildings are rarely seen in the United States. Only a few decades ago, the area around Salt Lake City was still a barren wilderness covered with yellow sand and roamed by Red Indians. Later, the leader of the Mormon religion led some men and women who were not afraid of hardship, pushing clumsy and heavy ox carts, and came across the Rocky Mountains. They suffered drought and locust plagues; they fought with brave foreign races and fought with the cruel pressure of nature. They began to build an irrigation system, turning countless deserts into fertile land. Now, the Mormon Church still displays many relics of the pioneers and all the pictures of the opening up. If you go to visit, they will carefully entertain and guide you.</p>
<p>Many Japanese immigrants live here, and many Japanese who grew up in the United States have almost been assimilated by the United States because they do not know how to write Japanese characters or speak Japanese. Many Japanese restaurants are open on the street, and the prices of the food inside are always very cheap. The local Americans, on the one hand, hate these short Easterners, and at the same time, they are very afraid of them. Compared with the Chinese expatriates, they are more self-conscious. They know how to unite and know how to protect the dignity of the country. At the Salt Lake Hotel where I was staying, the boss asked me what part of Japan I was from. When they knew I was Chinese, he gave me friendly advice, saying that in this area, you should call yourself Japanese. It is conceivable what the word "Chinese" evokes in the minds of Americans.</p>

<h3 id="e267">Although Financial and Silver Prices Fell, the Recovery of Standard Gold Was Not Strong <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Only Two Yuan and Forty Cents</p>
<p>The gold market rose and fell yesterday, and people's confidence could not last. Most buyers were afraid of repeating the mistakes of the previous day. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets in England and the United States uniformly contracted. The silver price for forward contracts on the Five Metals Exchange contracted by four and eight to seven li. The exchange rate was flat. London gold rose one penny. American cotton fell five pounds. American wheat contracted one point. People's confidence was extremely strong. The opening price of goods rose, reaching ninety-six or ninety-seven yuan, but fell due to frequent high-level supplies. It was flat after the opening. The banks' appetite became blocked and then returned. The domestic market was tight and began to rise, but because it was known in advance that HSBC Bank would post prices, the British and American exchange rates remained unchanged. Retail investors were originally short sellers, and took the opportunity to suppress prices. Major investors also learned from the previous day's situation and rushed to sell. The exchange rate then eased and the selling atmosphere rose. Downstream customers quickly entered, and prices, although low, still had a chance to rise. After the fall, the situation stabilized, hovering around three yuan. In the end, because the banks' appetite became blocked and the domestic market was still loose, a falling trend was lurking. People's confidence also became weak, and many sellers entered the market. Although the night market silver price in Seattle reported a contraction of six two five· three seven five· and half a point, it had no impact and gradually declined, breaking into the ninety yuan mark. The Central Bank also sold US dollars, but there were many who bought at low prices. After this, the price fluctuated around ninety yuan. The domestic market hardened, and it was difficult to avoid a decline before the noon close, but it stabilized again after the noon close, because there were not many transactions after the close, and it was easy to raise the price. The general psychology was that the Central Bank opened spot trading, and the Seattle night market silver price was reported to contract by six two five· one two five unchanged and contracted by two five. The market was stable at the opening. After entering, the bank sold and retreated slightly, but the psychology of buyers and sellers was different. In addition, the domestic market was extremely flat, so it fluctuated within one yuan, lacking special changes. Although there was no important news during the day, it was rumored in the market that the US president's opinion on the workers in San Francisco would be to issue public bonds to provide relief after they ended their strike, and that the future of the French franc was shaky. Unfavorable news such as this fueled the selling atmosphere. The price of red gold was calculated at 1,009 yuan and six jiao. The market situation of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 995 yuan and six jiao, a rise of seven yuan and four jiao compared to the previous close. Goods opened at five and a half yuan. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price of the British exchange rate at one shilling and four pence zero three one two five, and the American exchange rate at thirty-three yuan six two five.

<p>丨Silver Dollars Flowing Overseas as Well丨</p>
<p>The outflow of silver dollars from this city has been substantial, as repeatedly reported. Yesterday, the British ship "Luntzh" (transliteration) exported another 300 boxes of silver bars from Yokohama Specie Bank (a Japanese merchant), estimated at 1,350,000 yuan, and 200 boxes of silver dollars from Chartered Bank, totaling 1,000,000 yuan, for a combined total of 2,350,000 yuan, shipped to London.</p>
<h3 id="e270">The Stagnant State of the Silver Dollar Market Is Becoming Increasingly Profound <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>All Marker Transactions are Just for Show, and Price Difference Fixed at Five Cents</p>
<p>The silver dollar market is extremely stagnant today. Not only are the marker transactions just for show with no additional money involved, but the price difference between foreign and domestic dollars remained fixed at five cents from morning to afternoon, unchanging. As a result, market sentiment has become accustomed to this, with no excitement. Consequently, all kinds of market activity seem nonexistent, similar to a fixed position. Such inflexibility is truly not a blessing for our financial community. Split ticket transactions show no signs of improvement or decline. The estimated morning transactions for transfers and new deals totaled over 3.5 million, afternoon transactions totaled over 100,000, small assembly transactions totaled over 300,000, foreign dollar mortgage transactions withdrawals amounted to over 500,000, and new transactions amounted to over 700,000. Bank receipts and disbursements also regressed compared to the previous day. Foreign banks received and disbursed approximately 2.2 million in tickets, various goods and foreign exchange mortgage miscellaneous receipts and disbursements totaling over 4.6 million, telegraphic transfer funds totaling over 400,000, foreign exchange settlements totaling over 800,000, and warehouse withdrawals totaling 400,000. Chinese banks received and disbursed approximately 2.6 million in tickets, various goods and foreign exchange mortgage miscellaneous receipts and disbursements totaling over 4.5 million, customs duties totaling over 500,000, and warehouse withdrawals totaling 400,000. Japanese banks received and disbursed approximately 2.2 million in tickets, various goods and foreign exchange mortgage miscellaneous receipts and disbursements totaling over 3.7 million, and warehouse deposits totaling 300,000. Money shops and public foreign exchange settlements totaled over 34 million, foreign marker funds received totaled over 4.3 million, various inter-city remittances totaled over 700,000, banknotes withdrawn and issued totaled over 1.4 million, cash received totaled over 600,000, funds from merchants totaled 200,000, and payments totaled 300,000.</p>
<p>Additionally, the total amount exchanged at the city's clearing house was 7,133,568.34 silver dollars, including 3,564,686.22 silver dollars and 3,568,882.12 silver dollars in remittances.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Guangdong Silver Dollar Initially Tight, Then Loosened <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Jiangnan silver dollars slightly increased. The morning opening price was 834 yuan, already 1 yuan better than the previous market. By the afternoon market, it had increased another 0.5 yuan to 834.5 yuan, so the result was an increase of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Transaction volume was 4,000 jiao in the morning and 6,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong silver dollars were initially tight in the morning because 300,000 yuan was shipped to Dalian, so the market price was slightly tight, at 730.05 yuan, 0.05 yuan better than the previous day. Subsequently, due to sufficient reserves, it increased by 1.4 yuan to 729.1 yuan, but the result was still 0.09 yuan lower than the previous day. Transaction volume was 140,000 jiao in the morning and 80,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins increased in value by 1,500 wen, to 332,000 wen. The transaction price was 12,000 yuan in silver dollars, equivalent to 39,840 strings of wen.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Securities July Futures Final Day, Public Bonds Slightly Rise Due to a Short Squeeze <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the final day for July futures at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The market initially turned from flat and weak to strong, then slightly experienced a short squeeze. 96 bonds turned from stable to rising. Market sentiment gradually became lively because market prices had been suppressed for many days by the eagerness of long positions to exit the market, which was contrary to the recent trend in the bond market. Whether the speculation about the 96 bond restructuring is true remains unknown. Market sentiment improved because many speculative positions had already been unloaded. The number of people taking delivery in July was also substantial. Currently, a rise of one or two yuan seems achievable. Due to the pressure of many days, there will be a reaction, releasing the suppressed sentiment. The market yesterday did not show any signs of recovery at the opening. All the various flat and weak positions listed above gradually became strong, starting with the unified tax, forming a short squeeze, and rebounding by 0.1 to 0.45 yuan. The secondary market, except for the disbandment bonds, due to the short squeeze, retreated slightly this month, with a maximum decline of 0.065 yuan, while the long-term bonds rose by 0.2 yuan. The rest were all short squeeze situations, generally rising by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. The market price results showed increases ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 yuan. For example, the 20-roll 20-customs bonds only increased by 0.1 yuan, while the 23-customs and 96 bonds increased by 0.9 yuan. The number of 20-roll 20-customs bonds taken delivery of this month from the 4th to the 16th was substantial. Currently, the supply of chips is exhausted, and there should be a reaction. The total transaction volume was 19,345,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the comparative table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e273">New York Railroad Stocks Experience the Sharpest Decline <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (23rd), although trading on the New York Stock Exchange was more active than before, railroad stocks led the decline, falling significantly. Sell orders came from all over the country, due to pessimistic sentiment. This week's steel production was slightly lower than last week's, and speculators may have been disappointed with the government's orthodox financial plan. Many stocks were cut off due to insufficient margin. It is heard that speculators vacationing outside the city said that rather than risk having to pay more cash to maintain stale long positions, they would rather have brokers cut them off. The smaller exchange and bond market also fell, but U.S. government bonds fell only slightly. Foreign government bonds fluctuated wildly. Chicago wheat fell due to the visible increase in the supply of spot wheat. The total daily transaction volume was 1,180,000 shares. In addition, this firm's New York agent reports: (Securities) Railroad stocks weakened again due to increased railroad expenses and reduced income. Stock market trading was light and public interest decreased. The reflection of this in the market was a sharp fall in stock prices. (Grains) Prices rose further due to the heat wave, and crop losses continue, with no signs of abating. Prices have not yet reflected this serious situation and should eventually rise. (Cotton) Market conditions were weak due to news from Texas and the weakness of the stock market. Later, spot traders bought back to raise prices, because they had recently sold goods to the government and are now starting to hedge by buying back. Rainfall in the West led to rising prices, and long positions sold at high prices, now tending to wait for a reaction and then buy. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e274">Yarn Delivery Not Many Deliveries of Marked Yarn <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market trended weak, with a softer pattern, due to falling raw cotton prices, and with this month ending tomorrow, deliveries are still unlikely to be very enthusiastic. Most are arbitrageurs, so market sentiment is slightly weak. However, most of the large buyers are still not releasing their holdings, because many factories have been reducing and stopping work recently, and shipments have been reduced compared to before, so those who buy on dips and go long are still not lacking. The market plate has not undergone major changes.</p>

<p>The opening of the marked yarn market was still flat. The market slightly turned soft after the second and third trades, but the ups and downs were minimal. Long positions were still strong and showed no intention of releasing their holdings. The reason for this is that factories have been reducing yarn production and are bullish on the market, so the range of price fluctuations is very small. Each month only fell by 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 yuan. In the afternoon, with this month being the last day, those taking delivery were still arbitrageurs, and market sentiment was slightly weak. The second and third trades still showed no major changes. Each month fell again by 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 34,200 bales. It was found that Xiesheng sold 1,200 bales, Renfeng 750 bales, Junchang 800 bales, Yuan Yi 950 bales, Runkang 3,000 bales, Yuanda 700 bales, and Shenji 850 bales. Hengyi bought 700 bales, Dafeng 1,700 bales, Daji 900 bales, Yuande 600 bales, Shenji 450 bales, Xinchang 450 bales, Yuanda 750 bales, and Deji 400 bales.

<p>Spot yarn sales were still good. It was found that various groups bought a total of 1,247 bales for the day. Market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Northern Group 85, Haizhou 60, Tianjin 145, Peers 130, Guangdong 290, Ningbo 5, Inland 195, Shantou 10, Yunnan 185, Luzhou 120, Fujian 10, Xuzhou 2.</p>

<p>The decline in old cotton is increasingly severe, because the goods approved by the cotton inspection office have reached a huge 86,000 dan (market pounds). Those taking delivery, seeing the unfavorable environment, are afraid to come forward. Factories, with low yarn prices and reduced work, are less willing to take delivery. Therefore, there is an ample supply of chips in the market, and market sentiment is particularly fearful. New cotton is also weakening.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Zheng Marked Long Positions in Panic <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the marked cotton market showed old cotton with sufficient deliveries and a lack of those taking delivery. Those inspected and matched have reached a huge 80-90,000 dan. Factories, with depressed yarn prices, have no intention of taking delivery. Therefore, there are these large batches of chips in the market, and the long positions are in panic. The market price falls trade by trade. As for new cotton, although foreign cotton is expensive, the cotton mill industry is miserable, and cotton prices cannot rise independently of yarn prices, and also declined. Old cotton fell 0.4-0.5 yuan, and new cotton fell 0.3 yuan. The afternoon opening saw old cotton increasingly weak and new cotton flat, but by the close, new cotton had risen back, resulting in a flat result. Old cotton fell again by 0.15-0.2 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 166,400 dan. It was found that Dafu sold 15,600 dan, Jifeng 1,300 dan, Dafeng 3,800 dan, Changfeng 4,600 dan, Runkang 14,500 dan, Xincheng 3,600 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,600 dan, Yuan Yi 1,200 dan, and Taichang 1,800 dan.

<p>Spot cotton mill demand is particularly stagnant, because cotton mills have reduced production and decreased their use of cotton. As a result, transactions show no improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e280">The Early Morning Drought Areas Receive Rain, Weakening US Cotton, but Deterioration Gradually Reversed at the Close <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially weakened due to rain in the drought areas and selling on Wall Street. The trend at the close was firmer. The result was a 0.05 pound decline in spot prices and a 0.04-0.06 pound decline in futures. British cotton futures were unchanged. Indian cotton weakened due to reports of rain in Texas and profit-taking by long positions. The results were level for Pingguo Er and Bailuo Creek, and Aomula rose by 0.075 yuan.

<p>After yesterday's flour market opening, prices for each month initially fell and then rose. Chicago was down by around 0.1-0.3 yuan, and Canada was up by 0.08-0.1 yuan. When prices opened, they were initially calm, but later, inland merchant long positions, having loosened their minds since the rain, gradually released their positions. Some speculative long positions in this port also unloaded in large quantities, so August fell to as low as 0.335 yuan, September to 0.2475 yuan, October to 0.3725 yuan, November to 0.375 yuan, and December to 0.385 yuan, all down about 0.2-0.3 yuan from the previous day. However, after the third trade, northern merchants regained their appetite, and Tianjin, Yingkou, and other groups were seen buying step by step, so the market for each month rebounded. Northern grain prices also turned brisk. Merchant transactions are close to chasing the wind. Future observations suggest that unless the foreign wheat tax is avoided, the market will ultimately be taken over by long positions. (Yesterday, Amai (probably a brand) shouted 5.35 yuan, and if the tax exemption is 0.65 yuan, the result could be fixed. The current month is 0.075 yuan better, August is 0.05 yuan better, September is 0.025 yuan better, October is 0.025 yuan worse, November is 0.01 yuan better, and December is 0.05 yuan better.)</p>
<h3 id="e282">Major Players Waiting to See on Period Wheat <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's period wheat market, after the morning opening, generally showed a fluctuating pattern for each month. Foreign wheat prices, Chicago was down 0.1-0.3 yuan, and Canada was up 0.08-0.1 yuan. When prices opened, the market was already stable, and it was heard that the three ships of government wheat previously ordered by Fuxin had already arrived. The need for wheat may be temporarily stagnant, so although trading was still active in each trade, there was little movement in and out. Major long positions were also cautious, waiting to see if prices would fall back a bit. The results were that July, August, September, and October were each down 0.01 yuan, and November and December were unchanged. The spot wheat market saw the association's delivery trending quiet. Traders directly allocated to factories, about 3-4,000 bags, with no changes in price.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Before the Issue of Ordered Rice is Resolved, the Market for Foreign Native Rice is Difficult to Be Bullish <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>The market for native rice has been lackluster for days, all because there is no concrete solution to the ordered foreign rice. Some say that due to opposition from various inland groups, it has been agreed to postpone it. Others say that Zhejiang Province has suffered a severe disaster this year, and Jiangsu Province will also have a poor harvest. Moreover, various provinces are experiencing widespread water and drought disasters, and the Zhangzhou area of Fujian Province has also been flooded. In the future, various rumors are contradictory. In short, our country lacks statistics on food and only makes assessments based on sight. According to market talk, many hoarders are holding large quantities of goods from this rice price increase. If more foreign rice is ordered, prices will inevitably fall and cause losses. Therefore, the issue of ordered rice may be terminated or still be ordered in small quantities, taking both sides into account, etc. Because of these rumors, market sentiment is unsettled, and sales in various markets have naturally decreased. Yesterday, merchant withdrawals from inland areas slightly increased, and activity in this street also slightly increased. However, recently, a lot of rough goods from Hunan and the Yangtze River area have arrived again, so temporarily, the situation cannot be seen as favorable. Tongshi sold 750 bags per liter of Shayang, Hankou, Mingguang, and Hunan rough rice, 330 bags of Hunan machine-processed rice, and 96 bags of machine-oiled rice. Market conditions are still stable. In this street, only 200 bags of foreign small-grain rice were opened, priced at 8.3 yuan, down another 0.05 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Sales of River Rice are Stagnant and Falling <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of various groups was slightly scarce compared to before, with an estimated arrival of approximately 4,000 shi on the 24th and 25th. However, sales in various markets remained stagnant. Shops in this street had little movement, and merchant purchases were also suspended. This is a bleak situation, and the market continues to trend downward. A state of fatigue is difficult to revive for the time being. Sellers willing to unload are all willing to lower prices, only seeking a quick sale. Market conditions vary, with Changbang, Su, Tong, Nanhang, and other japonica rice, as well as Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and other late rice, all down by 0.2-0.4 yuan. In addition, Duyangjian and Yinbianyuan, as well as other varieties, also have limited sales channels and are constrained by japonica goods, with prices also down slightly by 0.2-0.3 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from various places in Hexia was over twenty. Various sales in the market were stagnant. The price of high-quality white japonica rice was down slightly by 0.2 yuan, medium and inferior grades were down slightly by 0.3-0.4 yuan, early rice was also down by about 0.3 yuan, and thin rice with high-quality top-grade goods was down slightly by 0.1 yuan, medium and inferior grades were down slightly by 0.2-0.3 yuan, Yang Dujian (a type of rice) was down slightly by 0.2-0.3 yuan, and the rest of the goods were down slightly by 0.1 yuan.</p>

<p>Our country's exports of Huzhou silk are depressed, all affected by Japanese silk, so shipments of Huzhou silk to Europe have been rare recently. Yesterday, the British ship "Luntzh" exported 246 pieces of Huzhou silk and 11,000 boxes of tea, totaling 1,100 tons, shipped to England.</p>

<p>In recent years, the silk factory industry has been on the verge of bankruptcy. Before the new cocoons came on the market this year, only about a dozen factories were barely working. After the spring cocoons were shipped to Shanghai, various manufacturers planned to resume operations. After detailed investigation, a total of thirty-three silk factories in the city have successively started work as of now, including Baotai, Xiangcheng, Fengda, Xiangyu, Huafeng, Xiesheng, Xinglun, Fuchang, Yuncheng, Dafeng, Fengtai, Meifeng, Meisheng, Junshengfu, Hongsheng, Hengcang, Dingchang, Yongheng, Xingchang, Dexing, Yutong, Yuanxing, Yufeng, Xuchang, Yutai, Chongyu, Yifeng, Fulunheng, Yuji, Gongda, Guangyuan, and Henglong. Among them, most are short-term in nature, renting factories to reel silk. The lease term is only set for 3-4 months. If there is a futures market after the term, they will extend the lease with the factory owner and continue working; otherwise, they will stop work and close down.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of this port, there was a strong demand for excellent eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, particularly from companies such as Yingzhuang, Xiehe, Yih和, Jinlong, Baochang, and Huacha Company. Trading of ordinary excellent eyebrow pearl tea was also slightly more active. The total transaction volume of excellent eyebrow shrimp eye and other green tea from various sources throughout the city exceeded 3,000 boxes, indicating a relatively smooth market. However, the opening price for extracted core goods fell to 160 yuan, while ordinary goods from Tunxi and Wudong opened at 94 yuan but continued to drop by 45 yuan in subsequent sales. Other varieties such as Gongxi and needle eyebrow tea also experienced declines without any increases. Many Chinese merchants suffered significant losses.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained stable with no significant fluctuations due to the firmness of customs gold. The association's designated price for Grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar was called at 19.95 yuan for spot goods, but no transaction occurred. Locally produced goods remained at the original price of 20 yuan. Dutch red sugar was priced at 15.3 yuan, and Taikoo Sugar's B mark was at 20.4 yuan. The local factory's refined white sugar rose by an additional 5 cents due to active sales. For example, Zhenyu, Zhenji, and Jinxin's Grade 1 white sugar were all quoted at 19 yuan, but transactions were not brisk. Dozens of packages of Nali white sugar were offered at 19.6 yuan, and scattered parcels of Hainan red sugar were offered at 12.8 yuan. Only over a hundred packages of ordinary Huanggang Qing from Chaozhou were offered at 13.25 yuan. Yesterday, cargo agents reported that land prices for Quanzhou white sugar had suddenly risen by 23 yuan, so no further arrivals were expected for the time being.</p>

<p>丨Our factory already has a substitute product丨</p>
<p>The sales of Xiamen tangerine peel candies have recently seen a slight uptick, but the demand is for high-quality goods. As a result, the better red and glossy soft candies were completely sold out yesterday. The remaining goods are of ordinary quality. Upon investigation, only five boxes arrived via the Jinan liner, and the existing stock was already depleted. However, the market price has not increased because the local factory has recently produced a product made from tangerine peel and sugar, which has the same function as tangerine peel candy and sells at a very affordable price, thus affecting sales.</p>

<h3 id="e290">Professional Alliance and Professional Petition <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Recently, university graduates in Peiping have formed a professional alliance. Its purpose is to demand employment from society. At the same time, representatives have been sent to Beijing to petition the central government for employment. This can be said to be a novel event in society recently.</p>
<p>The lack of career prospects for university students is not a recent phenomenon, but it has become more pronounced recently. In the past, most university graduates could still find some employment, even if it was not a good job and was often unrelated to their field of study, but at least they could find employment. But this is not the case recently. It seems that unemployment is the default for university graduates. Therefore, some people say that graduation is unemployment, which is not without reason. From this point of view, the career prospects for university graduates are much more difficult than before. The organization of a professional alliance by university graduates in Peiping, and further petitioning the central government for employment, is not without reason.</p>
<p>The lack of career prospects for university students shows the extent to which China's economy has declined. The current extremely desolate economic situation in China is what causes the general feeling of a lack of career prospects among graduates. As the social economy declines more and more, all industries are depressed, and new talents cannot be employed everywhere, and even old talents are often kicked out. Naturally, there are even fewer career prospects for new university students. This is the reason why university students generally feel that there is no way out. If the social economy continues to decline in this way, future graduates will feel the pain of having no career prospects even more. By then, I am afraid that not only will there be student professional alliances, but also larger-scale national youth unemployment organizations. However, unless the social economy improves, these organizations and these demands will be ineffective.</p>
<p>From the lack of career prospects for university graduates, we can see the extent to which the crisis of the entire Chinese nation has risen. The countryside is bankrupt, and national industries have been completely destroyed, leaving only the starving and cold people across the country. What a painful and terrifying situation this is. The lack of career prospects for university students, viewed in the context of the entire social problem, is only a small part of it. Other more serious problems at present, such as the total collapse of the national economy, are even more serious than this by ten or a hundred times. The lack of career prospects for university students is only one aspect of the surface events. However, even this small problem is enough to make us shudder when we hear about it. How will we deal with other more serious problems with an even more chilling attitude?</p>
<p>From the lack of career prospects for university graduates, we are also reminded of the issue of the sharp decline in the number of university applicants this year. According to surveys, the number of applicants for various universities this year has decreased significantly compared to previous years. This is not without reason. The total collapse of the national economy has also greatly reduced the number of students entering schools. This is a truly terrible phenomenon. In the future, I think there will not be many people left across the country who can afford to go to school. Universities are even less likely. What can those who have always advocated saving the country through education do about this?</p>

<p>— A Tan</p>
<p>Getting up early in the morning, the sun was already shining on the stinky water in the small river, spitting out bubbles. The train, like a lost soul, dragged its steps slowly and called out "woo". Si Xizi pulled Jin Guozi's hand and jumped off the sleepers, the grass basket containing the ice hitting his butt, his sister honestly putting her finger in her mouth and crying.</p>
<p>"You mother's little devils." The flagman guarding the iron gate waved the green flag and scolded affectionately. "Cry your mother's cunt, the train is afraid of not being able to crush you two little bastards."</p>
<p>!</p>
<p>Si Xizi pretended not to hear and walked past him, the train calling "Hurry! Hurry!" and chased past them. Gou Bao put the ice basket on his head and ran from the fork, gently slapping Jin Guozi on the ear. She deliberately cried loudly, holding her brother's hand and refusing to leave.</p>
<p>"Sister, let's go! Don't mind that dog." Si Xizi said.</p>
<p>"Si Xizi, I originally wanted to tell you something, but you just look down on people." Gou Bao put his hands on his hips, his eyes wide and round.</p>
<p>"Where does ivory come from a dog's mouth? I don't want to listen!" Si Xizi quickly walked away, pulling his sister's little hand.</p>
<p>"What are you doing, you always scold me?" Gou Bao chased after and asked.</p>
<p>"Did I scold you?" Si Xizi said with a smile, "Think carefully about your name. You're born of a dog, I'm even elevating you."</p>
<p>"Don't joke around." Gou Bao also laughed. Said, "Si Xizi, I met your mother yesterday! Oh, she's dressed so beautifully. Haha!"</p>
<p>"Where?" Si Xizi couldn't help but stop and asked! Since his father died, his mother ran away with someone not long after. Grandma the blind woman scolded him several times a day before she was willing to take Jin Guozi to beg for money. Earlier, Si Xizi and the other children were scavenging in the trash cans. The weather was too hot, and Grandma the blind woman had already fallen ill from the sun and couldn't move at home. Si Xizi and a group of little devils took advantage of this time to sell ice. Business was not bad, but Jin Guozi was too small to run, and she always cried when she thought of her mother. Si Xizi's heart broke when he heard this. Whenever he encountered a back view that looked like his mother, he always took his sister and shouted after them, selling ice.</p>
<p>"In the brothel!" Gou Bao said, flashing cunning eyes.</p>
<p>"What's a brothel?" Jin Guozi asked innocently, widening her eyes.</p>
<p>"Let's go, sister!" Si Xizi said, and punched Gou Bao's skinny, black face twice with a fierce look, saying, "You dare to make fun of me, do you recognize this?"</p>
<p>"Honestly, Si Xizi, I'm telling you the truth." Gou Bao chased after and said sincerely, "Little Sanzi heard that Little Cottage is also coming to sell ice. He doesn't even want to pay us respects, let's all beat this little brother-in-law."</p>
<p>"Is the rule made by you?" Si Xizi said more angrily.</p>
<p>"Are you insisting on going against us!" Gou Bao also got angry.</p>
<p>"If you want to go against you, then go against you, I bet you can't bite off my dick." Si Xizi was so angry that his neck turned red.</p>
<p>"Okay, you remember, beat this little brother-in-law!" Gou Bao said, running ahead and looking back at them fiercely even after walking a long way.</p>
<p>"Hurry, hurry up!" Zhao Di caught up with them at the Maigen Road station. Her yellow hair was draped over her shoulders, her gray and white short clothes fluttered in the wind, and there were several holes in her pants, revealing a pair of slender, bare legs. "Hey, Si Xizi, the sun is really good, it's already burning my skin, let's go quickly, Jin Guozi, good sister, it's getting late."</p>
<p>Why are you late too? Si Xizi asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, unlucky, unlucky. I passed by Little Cottage's house, and his mother is about to kick the bucket, lying on the ground moaning, asking for water! Little Cottage doesn't know where he's playing, so I had to pour her two bowls."</p>
<p>"Did she take any medicine?" Si Xizi said, "My father died because he didn't have medicine to take."</p>
<p>"She didn't take it either, the doctor from the epidemic hospital told her to buy it, but she doesn't have any money!"</p>

<p>Who could have expected it? Danxi has been robbed in the past year! It has been destroyed beyond recognition, and the people in the village have gradually moved to other places. All that is left in the village is a deathly silence: Danxi has been robbed! This is the sin of society!</p>
<p>The situation of being robbed is very common. It is happening in almost every rural village. Obviously, the only reason is the inevitable phenomenon of rural economic bankruptcy.</p>
<p>One energetic morning, a terrifying message suddenly came: the outsiders living in the Xiyang Mountains, because they could not stand the pressure of hunger, decided to mobilize a large group of people to go outside the mountains to snatch rice that afternoon. The so-called snatching rice is not just wanting your grain, it is like robbers robbing, but the name sounds better!</p>
<p>The entire Danxi was also plunged into a terrifying darkness. In those villages without any defense corps, everyone felt that this robbery was a very easy thing; the people in the village knew that only their own strength could be relied on, so the village leaders issued an order for each person to protect their own home. Families without men were protected by their close relatives; those with guns took out their guns, and those with knives took out their knives to save this life-or-death situation.</p>
<p>So the entire morning was spent in preparation, and women and children were hiding in the houses and not allowed to come out, because there was nowhere to escape at all.</p>
<p>Time finally came, and the scout in front ran back sweating profusely to report:</p>
<p>"Damn it! There are really a lot of people! The men are in the front to fight, the women are in the middle, and the children are following behind; the men are in charge of robbery, all with knives and guns; the women are in charge of looting the house, all with ropes and kitchen knives; the children are in charge of taking things away and running, all with ropes and carrying poles; the men, women, and children are connected all the way from the Xiyang Mountains to the stone road outside the mountains, there are really a lot of people!"</p>
<p>The village chiefs held a temporary emergency meeting and decided to defend the stone bridgehead. As long as the vanguard was not allowed to rush in, everything would be easily resolved.</p>
<p>Chanting to boost morale while walking, the large team of robbers gradually approached the stone bridgehead.</p>
<p>"Give them a warning!" The guards at the bridgehead fired two shots into the sky.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid! Charge up! We are going to starve to death, what are we afraid of?" The vanguard mustered their courage and rushed over in one breath.</p>
<p>Think about it, how can you resist so many people with five guns? Therefore, they finally rushed into the first line of defense.</p>
<p>The guards of the first line of defense retreated to the second line of defense, and joined forces with the people in the village to make one last stand, but they were unstoppable, and in less than a quarter of an hour, they rushed into the village entrance.</p>
<p>The village chief had no choice but to shout loudly:</p>
<p>"What do you want, brothers?"</p>
<p>"We have no food to eat!"</p>
<p>"Then, let's withdraw from the village and let you eat your fill! Okay?"</p>
<p>"That's also possible! We didn't want to hurt anyone in the first place!"</p>
<p>As a result, except for the guards in the first two waves, no one was injured, but the houses were looted clean, and the losses were countless!</p>
<p>The residents of Danxi, after suffering this major robbery,</p>
<p>moved to other places in a mess to find their way out, except for a few poor wretches who became lackeys.</p>
<p>The lovely Danxi, left with only desolation and loneliness, but the Danxi River is still flowing, and the Huangyan Mountain is still looming around.</p>

<p>— Min Jian</p>
<p>The sun was like a ripe apple, retracting its daytime radiance, like a shy bride, slowly pulling the surrounding white clouds over to cover her entire face.</p>
<p>At this time, the scenery on the earth all seemed very hazy and quiet, shrouded in a layer of gray veil. Sometimes, the calls of one or two crows flying across the sky punctuated the loneliness of the early autumn.</p>
<p>After a while, the sky became lively again, and the stars flickered with their brilliance as if competing for beauty, but no one was willing to make a sound, just lying quietly in the lonely black sky.</p>
<p>A breeze swept across the lake, causing the grasshoppers to chirp. I stared foolishly at the silent stars, intoxicated in the embrace of early autumn.</p>
<p>"Ah! What a beautiful early autumn night," I said, quite moved by the thought of returning home;</p>
<p>"The poplar trees that I planted in the yard five years ago must be towering trees by now. The swallows chirping under the eaves must have flown to the south by now. Also, the crickets under the bean trellis; they were called the orchestra by my sister, and now they must be playing their mysterious tunes there..." The scenes of my hometown floated into my mind like shadow plays, one after another.</p>
<p>The night is quiet, poetic;</p>
<p>A few desolate flute sounds came from the bamboo forest, and two or three fishing lights appeared in the reed pen, with the sound of oars hitting the water, suddenly awakening me, who was immersed in memories, and I looked aimlessly at the flickering fishing lights, unable to continue the memories I had just had.</p>
<p>The fishing boat was far away, the lights were gone, and the sound of oars no longer echoed. It seemed that the surrounding scenery had disappeared. What remained was only my lonely heart.</p>

<h3 id="e296">Low Fees <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I have a question concerning the safety of hundreds of thousands of women giving birth in Shanghai. Please take the time to publicly advise me, as if you were experiencing it yourself!</p>
<p>There is a K obstetrical hospital in Shanghai, with about six or seven branches, and no fewer than twenty female doctors who deliver babies. The scale cannot be considered small, and the delivery fees are particularly low, so it can meet the needs of middle and lower-class families! According to the hospital's regulations; the delivery fee is only four yuan; prenatal examinations and postpartum treatments are completely free, regardless of the number of times. However, the facts are completely opposite. The biggest problem with the hospital is the "blind injections" that are criticized by the general public in Shanghai! Regardless of whether the women giving birth need it, they always encourage them to get injections. The cost of the needle itself is often only a few corners, but the price is as high as five, six, or eight yuan per injection, so the hospital has made a fortune invisibly! And poor women giving birth, when there is a dangerous situation and they should get injections, but because the needle fee is too expensive, they cannot afford it, and can only wait for death. To give examples, I can't finish talking about it in a day. The hospital also has two shortcomings: (1) The female doctors who deliver the babies are very young and inexperienced, and they talk and laugh casually during delivery, with a negligent attitude, (2) The equipment and care are inadequate. Nurses come only once or twice a day and are not responsible for the babies. The bedding is not disinfected, and several women giving birth share an ordinary toilet, so it is easy for the women giving birth to contract serious diseases! I have a relative, Ms. Wang, whose family is not very well-off. She stayed in the hospital to give birth at the beginning of last month. A few days later, she got sick and was later transferred to a hospital in Ximen for treatment, but it was ineffective and she died. Another relative, Ms. Zhang, gave birth in the hospital at the end of the previous month. The injections alone cost more than twenty yuan. A week later, she also got sick and was later transferred to a hospital on Haige Road for treatment. She stayed in the hospital for three weeks and spent fifty gold yuan. Fortunately, she recovered. Now my two relatives are preparing to jointly demand compensation from the hospital for the losses, but my idea is to resolve it legally in order to effectively ban it.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Do you think these two cases should be resolved privately or officially? If a lawsuit is filed, what kind of procedures are required? In addition to the diagnostic reports from doctors at the two major hospitals of Ximen and Haige Road as evidence, are other witnesses needed? Please answer the above questions, I am not the only one who is grateful! I wish you</p>
<p>Literary peace! Zhang Qingfeng, July 12</p>
<p>Answer: Your letter reveals all kinds of dark secrets in the business of slippery obstetrical hospitals in Shanghai, which is indeed a serious issue related to the safety of hundreds of thousands of women giving birth in Shanghai. In addition to expressing extreme hatred for these quack doctors who only aim to make money and do not care about people's lives, the editor also regrets that your two relatives lack knowledge of the dark secrets of Shanghai and only knew how to be greedy for cheapness, resulting in the loss of wealth and life. Further, the executive authorities in Shanghai who manage health affairs should also be held responsible for failing to ban and supervise these hospitals with inadequate facilities and poor management, resulting in countless lives suffering losses. This issue is highly valued in European and American countries, because it is not only related to the interests of the people, but also closely related to the prosperity of the country. In Shanghai, which has a population of 3.5 million, there are only a few public and municipal hospitals. How can they meet the needs of citizens? Although there are private hospitals with subsidies, the ones with perfect equipment are all priced very high, and only a few high-ranking officials, wealthy merchants, and big tycoons can enjoy them. Poor scholars can only sigh. Due to the needs of this environment, slippery hospitals that call for low prices naturally emerged. At first, they attract people with the lowest prices, and then they deceive people into getting injections with business skills. Giving birth is a very important matter, and life is in the balance. It is common for strong and healthy young women to lose their lives in a moment or three due to giving birth. So in that situation, the women giving birth only hope to get through the crisis safely and be safe, so they do not care about their various extortions. These hospitals are aimed at making money, only knowing how to seek profit, and they will not care about other people's lives and wealth. Based on the fact that these executive authorities have neither established public hospitals extensively nor strictly supervised and evaluated private hospital doctors, such a serious problem has been created. In a place with such a large population, the birth rate must be very high. Before you raised this issue, I don't know how many women giving birth have died at the hands of these quack doctors (old-fashioned midwives are even worse). Thinking about it, it is really frightening!</p>
<p>The shortcomings of the hospital you mentioned are not accidental based on the above reasons. As for whether the death and near-death of your relatives should be entirely the responsibility of the hospital, this of course needs to be determined based on whether the hospital has any negligence in its business. However, since you have diagnostic reports from two hospitals as proof, it can constitute the basis for litigation. As for what kind of procedures are required to file a lawsuit, it is best to consult with a lawyer, which is more appropriate. In addition, submitting a request to the municipal government and public bureau for strict banning is also a legitimate method, and both can be pursued at the same time. As for private settlement, since you believe that this is an issue related to the safety of hundreds of thousands of women giving birth in Shanghai, there is naturally no need to say more, and even if you settle with him privately, I don't think he will sell you the account!</p>

<p>— By Bulgarian Ivan Vazov, Translated by Yang Sen</p>
<p>The peace treaty was signed.</p>
<p>Christmas was approaching, and the soldiers were about to be discharged. Several young men from Wittlern had already returned, but Stoyan was not among them. Indeed, there was no news of him. Mother Zuna gradually became uneasy, and painful thoughts assailed her.</p>
<p>The days passed, one by one: she often went to the door. Was someone knocking? Longuil. Stoyan Inov had returned: then came Dinkoov's son, followed by the Stamatov brothers. She sought them out, questioned them, but they knew nothing. Before a certain period, they had all seen Stoyan, but afterwards, none of them had seen him again.</p>
<p>"Mama, Demetrius is back," her daughter Qina shouted at her as she came home. So she went out again to see Demetrius.</p>
<p>"Hello, Demetrius. Where is Stoyan staying?"</p>
<p>Demetrius also knew nothing at all. "Perhaps," he said comfortingly, "they sent him past Vidin, and he will return by another road."</p>
<p>"Holy Mother, where on earth is my child?" she murmured.</p>
<p>She went to Stoyanga's house. At the door, her heart was beating violently. She guessed, undoubtedly, that Stoyanga would tell her news about Stoyan, that he had sent his greetings: and that he could be home before Christmas. But in fact, Stoyanga did not answer: she only remained silent, her eyes wet.</p>
<p>The whole town was in an uproar. They were waiting for the first regiment returning from the front to pass through here. Right in front of Mother Zuna's door, they had planted two trees, their branches intertwined to form an arch. Fragrant pine branches, brought from the mountains, were used to decorate the tree and the arch, and above them were signs, transported from afar from Bazargic, with the words: "Welcome our brave warriors!" Around the signs, there were countless Bulgarian tricolor flags, a veritable triumphal arch.</p>
<p>The victorious army arrived and passed through on time.</p>
<p>"Perhaps he will return a little later; he will certainly not spend Christmas in a foreign land. Stragglers are still coming, one after another. There are still countless moments until evening. He knows that there are countless anxious hearts waiting for him here."</p>
<p>That poor mother thought this way.</p>

<h3 id="e298">Re-examining Cantonese Sound Films from the Perspective of "Mass Language" (Part 2) <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Na</p>
<p>Mr. Danfeng says, "The mass language suitable for films is a very clear sentence like "What to do if it doesn't rain?" If this "clear sentence" is spoken to Cantonese people, won't it be difficult to understand even if it is not translated into Cantonese? Although Mr. Danfeng says "local color can be emphasized in pronunciation," this is really not advocating language unification, but rather advocating vernacular Chinese. In order to maintain local color, in China, where there is no unified national language yet, to have only differences in pronunciation, like a Scottish villager speaking English, is in fact acknowledging the necessity of the existence of dialect films. Mr. Danfeng also mentioned that the dialect of his hometown cannot be understood by the general public, and the problem inevitably extends to mass films.</p>
<p>At present, film is not for the masses. Now, film is still in noble, great buildings, serving as "eye-catching ice cream" for soft gentlemen. Art cannot exist if it is not for the masses. Dialect films! Drama! Literary movements are not separate from mass film! Drama! Literary movements. If the masses in Mr. Danfeng's hometown could not see films in the past, and now films begin to exist to meet their needs, would they understand these films if their dialect is not used? Or is it to promote the "national language" unification movement of the gentry, merchants, and compradors by using "clear sentences"? Or is it to make the masses understand reality, to organize and educate the masses by using dialects? Our answer is definitely the latter.</p>
<p>Mr. Danfeng believes that the mass language movement "is to liberate language and writing from vernacular Chinese, making it something that is easily understood by the masses." What exactly is the so-called "easily understood thing"? Judging from the example of "What to do if it doesn't rain?" cited by Mr. Danfeng, nothing has been explained.</p>
<p>"What to do if it doesn't rain?" This is a vernacular sentence, and a vernacular sentence that is easily seen in current film subtitles. But in sound films, this vernacular sentence, which is easily seen in current film subtitles, must be translated into Cantonese to be easily understood by Cantonese audiences, and the recording of this Cantonese will certainly not be the words "What to do if it doesn't rain?"</p>
<p>"Mass language should be liberated from vernacular Chinese," I think this does not mean that vernacular Chinese is not needed. In fact, the "liberation" in what Mr. Danfeng calls "liberating it, making it something easily understood by the masses" is difficult to explain. Judging from the example cited by Mr. Danfeng, it probably means that we should cleanse the "mule-like spirit" and "quotation style" from vernacular Chinese and accept the aspect that is developing and approaching the masses. This is correct, but the mass language proposal is more than just this step. Furthermore, this will not conflict with the promotion of dialects. Because the language that is most easily understood by the masses is not the classical Chinese written on paper that some people consider economical, nor the "mass language" written on paper that Mr. Danfeng considers clear, but their own living language that they use every day. And the "current" construction of mass language is not to immediately construct a spoken language that is commonly used by the masses nationwide. This cannot be achieved in one fell swoop in the "present." What we can do in the "present" is to promote the development of dialects and organize the "modern Chinese Mandarin" (in fact, Cantonese is accepting this Mandarin). And this is the advocacy of dialect film! drama! literary movement. "Now" the vast working masses are illiterate. To construct a mass language that is easily understood by the masses, including writing, reading, and listening, we must have a "movement to turn the spoken language of the masses in various regions into written language." Regarding this, I plan to discuss it further in the issue of film subtitles.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Danfeng says that we intellectuals are unwilling to delve into the masses, and the construction of mass language will not succeed. I would like to add a point, which is that the construction of mass language is not just a matter for us intellectuals, but also something that the masses do themselves.</p>
<p>Too much has been said. I hope everyone will correct me without reservation. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e299">Review of "Springtime for Henry" <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>Spring time for Henry</p>
<p>丨丨Great Shanghai丨丨</p>
<p>A consistently ordinary comedic film about love triangles and quadrangles.</p>
<p>Here, the true face of society is not revealed; on the contrary, the true face is covered up by scarlet love.</p>
<p>Originally, we are not saying that films cannot be made with love triangles and quadrangles as the subject matter. We can reflect the true turbulent face of society in the love entanglements of men and women in triangles and quadrangles.</p>
<p>But in general, in ordinary American romantic comedies, can we find any social truth?</p>
<p>I remember "Waterloo Bridge," starring Heifley, which was shown at the Tai Guang last year. Although it used the pink entanglement of love as its theme, the playwright could not help but touch on the truth of society and slightly mentioned the situation where poor parents had no choice but to give away their children.</p>
<p>But even these playwrights who slightly see the truth of society are rare. In general, playwrights not only do not go to see the truth of society, but they also try to cover up the truth with pink dreams.</p>
<p>"Springtime for Henry" is no different from ordinary American romantic comedies.</p>
<p>Even though the director achieved some success here, the more powerful his partial success, the more it covered up the truth. And some places are over the top, such as Henry taking off his formal suit and putting on a quilt, etc.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Charlotte Greenwood is the best, and Nancy Carroll is also very good.</p>
<h3 id="e300">Song of the Fishermen: Reasons for Box Office Success <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Sun</p>
<p>In the past, whether it was a Chinese or foreign film, it was already very rare to be able to show continuously at one theater for more than ten days. Therefore, when "Metropolis Morning" was shown in Beijing for eighteen consecutive days, everyone thought it was very strange. However, since "Sister Flowers" was shown continuously at the New Light for two months, it created a new record. However, its public screening happened to coincide with the Lunar New Year, and it also received a lot of so-called "timing" help. Now, the film "Song of the Fishermen" has been able to be shown continuously for more than a month in this hot summer, and it is said that it will continue to be shown. This can't help but be called a miracle in the Chinese film industry. Now, let me talk about the reasons why this film can be a box office success:</p>
<p>There are usually two sayings, saying "Those who perform in dramas are crazy, and those who watch dramas are fools." These two sentences are indeed very correct, and the more crazy one side is, the more serious the other side is. Taking "Song of the Fishermen" as an example, when it was released, if you mingled in the crowd and paid a little attention, you would hear many cries of pity coming from the mouths of the audience. This is an expression of their being moved by the people in the play. Therefore, the sadness of the story and the authenticity of the performance are the biggest reasons why "Song of the Fishermen" can be a box office success.</p>
<p>The second level is that a drama's story must first have universality. In other words, it must make everyone able to understand the content of the story without feeling any awkwardness. For example, let's take foreign films as an example. Films like "Women" and "The Adventures of Don Quixote" are not as popular as ordinary films. There is no other reason, it is because the former has a deeper meaning, which cannot be understood by ordinary audiences. Then, taking the two films "Life" and "Song of the Fishermen" as examples, if viewed from an artistic standpoint, they are both excellent works in domestic films. However, because the meaning of "Life" is deeper, in terms of commercial gain, "Song of the Fishermen" finally won.</p>
<p>Let's examine the editing techniques of "Song of the Fishermen." Except for one or two shots that are slightly lengthy, it is completed in one go from beginning to end. Every frame is powerful, and every episode is stimulating. And the further it goes, the more intense it becomes, tightly grabbing the audience's hearts. This level is indeed worthy of praise.</p>
<p>There is also another level, that is, the success of "Song of the Fishermen" has been greatly helped by the power of sound. Such as: the mournful sound of singing and playing the Song of the Fishermen; the roar of wild wind and waves, etc. If "Song of the Fishermen" was not dubbed, perhaps the depth of its emotional impact would not have been so great!</p>

<p>— Bai Bei</p>
<p>Everyone has the development of their own thoughts. Every actor has their own personality, and this is unchangeable. Of course, an actor can specialize in more than one "specialty," but in the end, it is impossible to find an all-purpose "star"!</p>
<p>But in China, it is not the case. We often see a star playing a "tragic role" in Film A, a "comedic role" in Film B, and a "martial arts character" in Film C. May I ask, how can they have artistic in-depth development if they pursue them without purpose? Is it really like the advertisement says: "All-purpose...?"</p>
<p>Hollywood's Lillian Gish is famous for playing tragedies well. Heifley is famous for his hippie smiles. They are always pursuing what is close to their own character, and they are not comparable to those who are fickle. However, sometimes we can see the wording "changing style" in advertisements. However, it is necessary to recognize that they "change their style" because they find dissatisfaction with their original strengths. Or feel the difficulty of "in-depth study," so there is this "change of style," and it is not that they play whatever role they like.</p>

<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Love is originally very sacred; but now in the city, there are often a group of young men and women who regard love as a kind of commodity like a transaction. There are even many people who think that marriage is the tomb of love, and practice the heresy of men and women loving each other without getting married. This is very regrettable. The film "City Love" (Sally Bishop), which is opening at Cathay today, is based on the famous work of the famous novelist Temple Thurstun. It aims to expose the secrets of this abnormal love. The whole film is full of ironic tones, humorous flavors, humorous performances, and passionate emotions. The heroine, Joan Blondell, is not only beautiful in appearance, but also has very considerable subtlety in her expressions. The other male and female supporting roles are also competent.</p>

<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>Lilian slipped out of George's arms and walked to the mirror opposite. She suddenly jumped up again and shouted, "That guy hid my makeup box again!" She stood in front of that mirror for a long time. She felt that she was really beautiful, with her eyelids half-closed and her mouth slightly open, showing a shy and innocent look, just like a bride who had not yet married, being helped to the altar. She felt that this expression was too good and should not be wasted. She turned around and shyly said to George, "George, why haven't you ever proposed to me?" George felt strange and said, "I never thought you would be interested in that." Lilian sighed and said: Alas, George, you really know too little about the real Lilian Garland! I only know that she is an actress, but I am tired of the theater. I am not living. I am performing... I am afraid that when I am about to die, I still won't believe that I am really dead. Oh, I have died countless times and fallen in love countless times. I can't tell what is real and what is fake." George walked up to her and asked her in a low voice, "What do you say is real after all?" Lilian blinked her eyes and wiped away her tears, and then said very solemnly, "A house, a home, a small children's room upstairs, with a few cookie jars inside, and the sound of children's feet going up and down the stairs..."</p>
<p>Just as Lilian was saying that, she heard the door behind her open. Her heart beat wildly, and even her breathing was about to stop, because when she turned around, she saw Oscar Jaffe standing at the door, staggering forward. His hand was supported by a wooden frame, which he had thought of at the last minute, and he admired his own cleverness for it. No woman, especially not Lilian, he thought, could see his injured and suffering expression without feeling pity. But he still couldn't put on a sad face, because he had encountered a surprising adventure... that adventure was enough to make him cheer. First, two bearded men came to Jaffe's box to find him. They were important members of a "Passion Play Troupe." They had also escaped because of their failure in Poet's Valley. When they saw Jaffe, they told him about their experiences. Jaffe got an inspiration from this... he could perform the "Passion Play" and have Lilian play the role of Medeline in the play! What's more, a millionaire, Mr. Clark, a deeply religious industrialist, volunteered to help financially. The millionaire said that he would spare no expense to help, and he gave him a large check, saying that it was only the first check!</p>
<p>Jaffe knew Lilian's temper very well. He did not dare to reveal so much good news on his face. All he had on his face were some traces of pain that he was trying to hide. He spoke. He said, "Lilian, I came to see you and say 'Hello'." His voice was extremely soft. But Lilian's voice was very tense. She said, "Oscar, I don't want to talk to you. Please go! I have nothing to say to you! I have no time to listen to anything you have to say"! George heard this and stood up. He scolded Jaffe, "I warn you. Be careful. Don't come here to mess with Miss Garland. What I say is what I say. Get out!" Jaffe was both frightened and ashamed. He said to Lilian, "Lilian, you can ask him to throw me out. This is really an unbelievable thing. My coming here is still magnanimous, regardless of the past... specially to congratulate you on your success." (To be continued)</p>
