<h3>川北匪患之前瞻與後顧　廷</h3>
<p>考川北匪禍之猖獗。蓋起於前年之十月。時徐匪向前。乘川省各軍反劉（文輝）之戰。由陜竄川。席捲通，南，巴，一帶。而直下綏，宜。設川陜僞蘇維埃政府於南江之長池。標榜工農紅軍第四方面軍之番號。擴充實力。不數月間。竟由萬餘人而增爲十五六萬。而所謂别動隊與遊擊隊者。猶未與焉。其發展之迅速。實在賀（龍）孔（荷寵）吳（煥先）三匪之上。而川省軍閥。自二劉以下。若鄧，田，李，羅，輩。莫不勇於當前之私鬥。遂令赤勢坐大。寖成燎原。迨劉文輝敗遁西康。劉湘等榮膺剿匪總司令總指揮等頭銜。始感覺痛癢。而謀應戰。則川北匪區人民。被戕於匪者。已無慮百萬人矣。其犧牲之慘烈。說者謂自張獻忠後。三百年來。無與倫比。懷想及此。誠不能不令人太息痛恨於無旣也。</p>
<p>劉湘之出任剿匪總司令也。尙爲去年月間事。而下令總攻。則遲至十月十五依其計劃。剿匪軍事。凡分五路。一路鄧錫侯。取南江。二路田頌堯。取儀隴。三路李其相，羅澤洲。及四路楊森。取營山。五路王陵基。取綏宜。五路之前進也。本當如輔車之相依。指臂之相應。無如進剿之初。裂痕已顯。五路中惟劉氏嫡系之第五路。最肯用命。故能一鼓而下綏宣。次之爲三四兩路。猶能相機策應。而一二兩路則竟貌合神離。觀望不前。推其心理。無非欲保全實力。留爲後用而已。嗣鄧田等因不勝各方責難。始肯稍露熱忱。繼起而克服昭化，劍閣，及儀隴一帶。其時。匪勢雖稍蹙於前。然究未足以制其死命。不謂劉湘竟迫不及待。率先發表剿匪軍事結束後之裁軍計劃。及電請中央取消四川省政府而以善後督署爲四川最高機關之議。劉氏雖聲明裁軍一事。任令各軍自便。絕不苛求。然其他軍閥猜忌成性。究不能無鳥盡弓藏之感。其影響於剿匪前途者。殊非淺鮮也。</p>
<p>綏宜克復後。第一期之進剿計劃。勉强完成。遂定本年一月十三日爲二次全綫總攻之期。然言其戰績。亦惟第五路軍佔領通巴宜綏間惟一天險之馬渡關一役。差足稱道。且即此一役。字軍得乎之主因。亦尙在匪部之自相殘殺耳。徐匪洞燭剿匪軍内部渙散。惟第五路軍爲其惟一之敵人。故不惜出全力與之相搏鬥。方前方軍事緊急關頭。其餘各路袖手作壁上觀者仍多。成渝耆紳曾鑒胡景伊等百餘人忍無可忍。乃電勸各將。激發天良。悲憤之氣。溢於言表。</p>
<p>第五路軍。旣自馬渡關而直趨巴中。二三兩路遂亦會師其地。惟一路軍。獨當北面。遙爲聲援。實則虚張聲勢而已。巴中旣陷。匪退通江。以常情推測。匪燄或可稍殺。然因匪區日蹙。防綫縮短。其戰鬥力反得而集中。徐匪以通江之得失。關係絕鉅。遂不惜背城借一。與第五路軍作殊死戰。是役也。雙方肉搏於懸崖絕壁閒。往復衝鋒。時得時失。五路軍損失之嚴重。稱各役最。其師長許堯卿氏。乃長電劉湘。有徐匪憑恃天險。拚死頑抗。若不設法攻心。使其内潰。徒恃武力。恐短期間不易肅清之語。巴中戰後。五路軍孤軍深入。似已入於剿匪軍事之第三期矣。奈各路客軍。未能同時挺進。以致三次總攻萬源。勞師喪財。計其成績。乃不如當地團練與「聖毌團」等之民衆武力。八月十七日。蔣委長特電劉湘。着其轉飭各軍。努力進剿。嚴禁徘徊觀望。否則當惟各該長官是問。此電去後。未及一週。而二十三日萬源再戰。劉軍慘敗之耗。即追鍾而來。劉氏憤愧。而有辭職之舉。嘗聞川北貧瘠。糧食缺乏。而萬源一帶之秋收。則向在八中旬前後。赤匪得此新穀。餉糈有着。此後平亂。將益難矣。</p>
<p>由是觀之。此次川北剿匪軍事之挫折。實因五路軍未能充分聯絡。以致徒糜軍費。而卒少建樹。其間惟第五路軍剿匪最力。其功自不可沒。然以其爲劉湘嫡系故。適遭各軍之忌。至於各軍之觀望不前。固堪指摘。然平心而論。如劉湘能知覊縻之道。勿令妄生猜忌。則或不至如此。且吾人猶憶當徐匪佔領川北十餘縣時。勢燄甚張·田·鄧·楊·李·各部。朝不保夕。劉湘漠然無覩。當時匪衆本可利用此種局面。予以各個擊破。但因接應賀龍。急於東犯。致爲劉部所乘。則所謂不能合作之咎。即湘本人。亦不能自居於例外。君子責人也恕。而責已也周。願湘平心靜氣。反躬自省。最近中央對湘之辭職。已有懇切慰留。並允補助川省剿匪經費一千萬元。而爲各方詬病號稱人妖之劉從雲氏。復有通電下野解除前敵軍事委員長之說。或者川北剿匪軍事。經此周折。可以有一轉機。正未可知。然期前途成敗之癥結。仍在於各軍之精誠合作。此則端賴各軍之覺悟而已。此外。關於川北之匪患。所應注意者。猶有二事。一則在力謀川東交通之便利。儘速建築萬縣至宜漢一段公路。以利軍事之運輸。二則在厲行封鎖鄂·陜·甘·川·之邊區辦法。以防赤匪之外竄。至若打破川省獨有之防區制度。禁止田賦預征。及廢除苛捐。統一幣制諸端。胥有關於川省長治久安之道。非僅剿匪一端。姑不贅論。</p>

<h3>行營紀念週席上孔荷寵之報吿</h3>
<p>前赤匪僞第六軍團總指揮孔荷寵投誠後、於上月二十日出席行營總理紀念週、報吿赤匪總崩潰情形、其大略已誌二十四日本報、茲更將孔氏報吿全文、補錄如左「主席同志們、荷寵今日得參加總理紀念週、本是一件很榮幸的事、但返躬自問、一方面覺得祇有慚愧、一方面覺提祇有惶恐、漸愧的是以前誤入歧途、鑄成大錯、惶恐的是本人不過一孔之夫、待罪轅下、乃蒙委員長不咎旣往、優禮有加、這種寬大、同時更使我　身無地　歉仄萬分了、至本人身世、剛才已蒙主席介紹、尤爲感激、現旣躬逢盛會、惟有將以前所受經歷、分作如下的三部份報吿出來、以爲肅清土匪的參考、也就是找表示謝忱的一種貢獻、甲·來歸志願、乙·匪區實	况、兩·個人意見、</p>
<p>現在先講甲一部份、我自從民國十六年參加僞蘇維埃革命後、現在已經過八年的時光、參加的意旨、原來想爲羣衆謀利益而戰鬥、並不是爲個人利益而戰鬥、乃不料參加以後經過八年試騐的結果、與原來的意旨適得其反、不僅政治水平日益低落、即羣衆的生活、亦一天天的痛苦、完全受了共産黨欺騙、這就是共産主義走不通的一個明證、因此就發生了一種新的感想、我自從一九二七年以後、在蘇維埃政府下從司令起至總指揮止、雖有相當的地位、然就國家社會民生上一加考查、終覺是一種盲從、而且闡到都是非人的生活、因爲中國不是一種工商業發達的國家、談不到什麽資産階級和無産階級、羣衆都不過是六窮小窮、根本上就無産可共、而他們偏要用一種强硬的乎段、生呑活剝的來幹、所以結果祇有愈幹愈失敗、這是共産主義不能實現的原故、再言他們的策略、最初是　　　被第三國際爲機會主義改行秋白路綫、結果他又被認爲盲動、繼之就是立三路綫、不久仍是失敗行不通、於是又是什麽羅明路綫、佈爾什維克路綫、種種路綫、不但依然失敗、並且把　般自命爲領袖的人們、反弄得派别分歧内訌不息、由此更可見中國絕對不能實行共産主義、正成鐵的事實、祇有唯一的國民黨三民主義、才合中國的國情、才合現代的環境、才可以實現、才可以救中國、所以本人毅然决然的下最大决心、自拔來歸、絕不是爲不能吃苦、也不是爲升官發財、完全中求在蔣委員長領導下、爲拯救勞苦羣衆、爲消滅赤匪、爲實現三民主義而來、這是來此的意義和志願的大概、</p>
<p>再就是講第二部份匪區實况在共産黨實行土地革命以來、他們所謂照馬克斯時代列寗時代採取分田政策、但一時主張沒收百畝以上的地主土地、一時又主張沒收一切土地、從新分配、弄得羣衆未得具利、先受苛捐雜稅代工的寄、簡直是欺騙勞苦羣衆、以爲匪等奪取政權的工具罷了、最近又說羣衆都願到前綫當紅軍來號召羣衆、供其犧牲、其實未有一人願意、都是壓迫去的、刻下匪區内壯丁全無、怨聲載道、也是這個道理、其次僞總司令在軍事方面、現在也變更了策略、第一、他以僞第一第三第五軍團爲主力軍、用於主要方面抵抗國軍、以僞第七第九軍團來用於次要方面牽制國軍、第二、組織各種游擊隊、企圖擾亂國軍後方、第三、集結主力、襲擊國軍弱點、尋找運　戰、實行短促突擊、第四　加緊羣衆力量、這是最近匪之策略另有一種戰鬥手段、就是每運每班都配備有一個精幹的射手、單獨射擊國軍的目標、而邪不敵正、理所當然、種種狡謀、均被國軍擊破、結果只束手待斃等那死神降臨而已、再自國軍實行封鎖以來所用米鹽等等、幾乎斷絕、匪游擊隊又不能隨便行動僞中央所發行的鈔票、我走時有一千多萬、沒有一個現金、買一兩油鹽動需一元、經濟來源、全靠各種稅收、預算匪區稅收、也不過支持三四個月還有八九個月經費、完全靠打土豪、現在土豪又打完了、又要羣衆做所謂「節省運動、」刻已節省過三升米兩次、八升米兩次、五升米兩次、還有菜也要羣衆節省、供給他們、這種制命傷痕、一方面是封鎖嚴密的力量、一切油鹽食品不能進到匪區、同時匪區生産品不能賣出來、尤其五次圍剿以來、匪區逐漸縮小、一般羣衆對僞蘇維埃共産黨、都很不滿意、都想到國軍裏面來、這是匪區羣衆心理的一斑、再說匪方主力軍、不能克服堡壘政策、特别是士兵、最怕飛機大砲、尤其是每次戰爭、都歸失敗、生活又極痛苦、所以來此投誠的、日漸增多、這是一個證明匪軍實力、現在後方編好的號召的有二十萬、其中男女都有、都是强迫來的、每一批開到前線、都逃跑光了、現在得力有爲僞一三五七九軍團、共十二個師、五個敎導師、每團還有獨立營特務連游擊隊等等、其餘的匪軍不是人不足額、就是槍枝不够、毫無訓練、不堪一擊、以上所說的都是匪區實際情形、</p>
<p>再講第三部份、個人對匪區意見、要如何消滅土匪、要如何使土匪永遠不發生、我們參照上述的匪區實際情形、來攻擊匪的弱點、以個人的意見、最重要的就是要從政治方面着手第一組織問題現在我們國家羣衆組織力量薄弱、應加緊組織羣衆、有了羣衆我們就可以借他的力量來改造一切、譬如匪軍合計不過十餘萬、爲什麽要這樣多的國軍來打他、這就是因爲紅軍以麻醉手段、抓住羣衆、爲其和用的緣故、第二訓練問題、我們有了羣衆、有了組織、還須加緊去訓練去敎育現在文化落後、羣衆知識幼稚、共産黨就和用這個弱點來打土豪、來麻醉羣衆而羣衆無知無識、居然受他的欺騙、所以必須嚴格實行特種敎育、其方法要以三民主義來克服共産黨、土地革命的欺騙伎倆、唯有這樣才能使民衆信仰三民主義、中國土匪才永遠不會發生、第三爭取羣衆羣衆問題世界各國都很注意、就是戰敗後的德國、他是抓住羣衆而復興起來的、現在匪區的羣衆約有二百萬、他的人才武力經濟交通等：：：一切都不及我們、而我們的一切都超過他、我們如果能够把這二百萬羣衆抓到手裏土匪不打自滅、因爲土匪完全是靠羣衆而生活、假使我們去爭取羣衆、一定是很容易的、不過有幾個方式要注意、第一、我們的宣言或傳單、不要寫明「匪區羣衆」字樣、因爲有一匪字羣衆衆就不敢看、根本不去看、第二文字要通俗簡單、使羣衆易於了解、并且不僅爲白話、還要多註明幾個字、使他懂得發生好的印象、這是爭取羣衆的辦法、以上都是政治方面、其次軍事方面、現在最注意的、要攻打匪的弱點、第一、土匪最怕飛機大砲、我們應多備飛機炸彈和大砲、特别注意匪的工事、第二要加緊封鎖線、像贛州元江口方面封鎖很鬆、每日都有食品出入、這是我們應該特别加緊封鎖、絲毫也不能放鬆的、第三、注意縱橫碉堡、我們應該馬上加緊碉堡政策、并多多建築縱橫碉堡、形勢地帶不使匪有逃竄的機會、以我揣測、恐怕共産黨將來往貴州四川方面逃竄、因爲貴州四川山勢險要、交通不便、生活能獨立、且文化落後、羣衆又易受麻醉、稍不注意、便滋蔓難圖、所以加緊封鎖、和碉堡政策、使匪一個也逃不出去、這是最緊要不過的總之我這一次來、已抱着最大的决心、在過去我每天工作十四小時或十六小時、現在我情願再多作幾個小時的工作、我的意志、土匪一天不消滅、我一天就不會放手現在戰士們應在蔣委員長領導之下統一意志的、一致的來决心消滅土匪、復興中國、這是我個人的志願、」</p>

<h3>重估旅館捐額之理由</h3>
<p>工部局方面發表、關於旅館業公會爭議新估捐額一事、其事實内容、係工部局方面、對於十六家旅館之市政捐估額、近曾重新加以審查、審查之結果、内有五家、所付與房東之租金、與市上現行之租値、大致相符、其捐額即照租金計算、未生問題、另外三家、係自造房屋、其現行估額、查悉頗爲平允、故亦未加更動、下餘八家、其估額經予修改、俾令與前述五家之付租者估額大致相同、八家中已有一家接受局方所改定之數目矣、</p>
<p>至其他七家旅館、向工部局提出異議者、均係自造房屋、其現今改訂之估額、實以鄰近同類房屋所付賃金爲凖、換言之、此七家旅館捐額之估計、與一切房主自居之屋、估計同一辦法、即係照其租値爲凖、而事實上、此次估定之數、尙均在同等的實付租金之下也、</p>
<p>旅館同業公會主張、請工部局對此事作一整個的考慮、但因各家情形不同、事實上不得不分别審議、凡對於捐額有所爭議者、均有權向捐稅估計委員會陳訴、該委員會係一公正之機關、可調查一切事實、而判定所估之數是否公允也、</p>

<h3>結婚後的女人底自學問題（續）</h3>
<p>丨答劉詢岳丨</p>
<p>當然，這種刻毒的指摘，並不是毫無根據的，眼前的事實、不能不形成這樣的結果。但是，這只是形式的觀察，並不能作婦女墮落的基本原因。婦女之不願由學校再踏入社會，婦女自身固也應該負相當責任，主要的，却是舊社會的束縛，還沒有完全從婦女身上解脫。甚至一點沒有解脫。</p>
<p>大家總以爲社會已經允許了婦女進學校和男子交際婦女就算得到解放了，其實，這不是實在的，我們應該進一步問，社會是不是已經替婦女安置好了和男子同樣的社會地位，給予她們獨立的經濟地位？如果沒有，那末，現社會的婦女敎育的根本就是製造裝飾品，甚至新式商品的敎育。我們常常發現許多婦女結婚後的苦悶，這種苦悶甚而破壞　她們對於丈夫的愛情。這原因，就是山於她們的思想與她們的環境發生矛盾的結果。她們因爲求知欲或事業心很重的。他們希望成爲一個完全的人，她們希望能在社會上做一份事業，但是，她們出路在那裏呢？她們能够找到些什麽事做呢。不要說，在這失業恐慌的浪潮中，許多大學畢業的男子也尋不着挿足地更何况婦女。而事實上，社會也從來就不曾這樣替婦女着想過。在這種環境的束縛之下，實際上學問對於她是等於無用的東西，旣不能當飯吃，也不能當衣穿，而她們的求學，也便不能不以尋丈夫爲止了。這在前進的婦女固然還可以在極端的苦悶中掙扎，保守的婦女便只有屈服地把求學的心理轉變到服侍丈夫和養兒子上面去，更進一步的便只有索性叉麻雀看電影了。如你的堂兄那位夫人一樣，這或許並不是她安於堕落，而是因爲生活的不調和（思想與環境的不調和）有意找尋刺激，也是很可能的。</p>
<p>婦女們的這種命運，當然並不一定等到結婚後才决定，早在她們的父母送她們入學時便已决定了。父母的送女兒入校就很少有希望女兒成功一個洋博士或一個大學問家的意思，大都只是爲了女兒的幸福，希望能够找一個較好的女婿，不過結婚在女子整個生活過程上說，是和社會接觸的第一步，也就是她們學校生活的結束。人總是有希望的，有憧憬的，婦女們在學校時，也不能例外，是抱着求知的熱忱，但一等和社會接觸，别的希望沒有了，前面旣無路走，求知慾也就自然要消沉下去，所以結婚雖不是妨碍婦女求知的原因，但結婚却使婦女不能不踏入她們安排好了的命運。丨未完丨</p>

<h3>開學了</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>小朋友們，光陰過得迅速的很，一轉眼暑假期已經過去了！你們在這五十天裏面，究竟温習過功課沒有？究竟荒廢功課了沒有？這都要你們自己反省一下。</p>
<p>暑假過去了，又要開學了，你們究竟能夠升級嗎？你們對於學校裏的功課，能夠勝任愉快嗎？這也要你們自己檢討一下。假如你們已經是升級了，對於你們的學業，當然還要繼續努力。如果不幸被留級了，那末你們也要一反從前的積習，來從新作一個好學生。聖人曾說過：「過則毌憚改，」人非聖賢，那個能沒有過？不過有過就要知道改，如果明知有過而不肯改，那就壞了！</p>
<p>小朋友們，五十天的暑假過去了，現在正是你們用功的時候了！小朋友們，努力吧！</p>
<h3>介紹一個小朋友給你</h3>
<p>— 張翊德</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們大概都知道從前美國的大總統林肯吧？可是他在做小朋友時是怎樣的，你們或許會不知道，我現在來吿訴給你們聽吧！</p>
<p>他在西曆一千八百○九年二月十二日生於「肯脫記」地方，小時便是很窮苦的，住在矮矮的木板搭成的破屋中，一堆亂蓬蓬的稻草，就算他過夜的床了，他做事很勤勞的，耕田也會，刈草也會，並且打禾，牧牛等雜事，他沒有一樣不會的。他還常常替鄰人做事，所以鄰人也很歡喜他。</p>
<p>他讀書也很用功，可是太窮了。連書本也買不起，時常向有的人去借，倘使這個人在幾里之外，他就得趕上這許多路。有一次，他借來的一本「華盛頓傳」被他不小心汚損，這時他很胆小的去央求主人，主人對他說：「你替我做三天工，這書就給了你。」他得了書，便在空閒的時候，用心的背出，把全本書都記上腦裏。</p>
<p>他寫字也沒有筆和紙的，用燒剩下來的焦炭，在地上，牆上，石上畫着。這樣他雖是苦得讀不起書，但是孜孜不倦的讀，不久就做了萬人欽仰的美國大總統。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們已知道了嗎？一個人不必自暴自棄，以爲沒有機會讀書，就不讀書。你們應當學林肯的苦學，將來才有出路哩！有機會讀書的小朋友們。更不可錯過光陰，快些用功吧！</p>
<h3>新童歌</h3>
<p>— 承明</p>
<p>排排坐，吃果果，大家請吃中國果。利權旣可保，漏巵也可杜。寗願肚子餓，不吃那些舶來貨。</p>
<p>小朋友，志氣高，入學敬先生，回家敬父老。兄弟姊妹須親愛，親朋見面哈哈笑。</p>
<p>不讀書，最苦惱，有眼瞎子被人笑。旣不能做大事業，又不能做大好老。你想懊惱不懊惱？</p>
<p>小朋友，須勤儉。勤讀書，一切費用須從儉。要知家長辛辛苦苦賺下汗血錢，供給學費已不資，那裏還可揮霍濫用不惜錢？</p>
<h3>動物小研究</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>（蚯蚓是否能鳴）　敏兒捉到一條蚯蚓，見它口腔絕細，不像生有發音機關。不過他看見古書上明明有「蚯蚓鳴」一語，便跑去叩問爸爸。</p>
<p>爸爸說；「昆蟲的作聲，大都翅下生有膜囊，振動而發響。蚯蚓沒有膜囊；口内他沒有發音器，他怎麽會呌呢？原來土中還有一種螻螻，它的窟穴，是和蚯蚓近鄰。它生有翅翼；也有膜囊，在穴中振膜作曲，古人不察，便以爲是蚯蚓鳴了。實在蚯蚓只會掘土，絕對不會呌喊的。」</p>
<p>敏兒聽了爸爸的話，纔知有許多事物，須要實地去考察，「盡信書那也是沒用的。</p>
<p>（益鳥和害鳥的鑑别）　枝頭上的小鳥，毛羽美麗，鳴聲宛轉，那是人人所喜悅的。不過這許多鳥類中，有些對於吾們有益；有些對於吾們有害。吾們怎樣去分别它呢？</p>
<p>鳥類也要吃喝的，有些是喜歡肉食，專們啄食田間樹上的小蟲，這種鳥間接帮助園藝和農功，所以是有益的還有一種鳥赴素食的，專門啄良穀類果實等，豈不是直接有害於人類的嗎？</p>
<p>啄良蟲類的益鳥，大都嘴尖尾長，殺行很速。燕子便是益鳥的代表。啄食穀類的害鳥，大都嘴鈍尾短，飛行不甚靈敏，我們日常所見的麻雀，便是這類的代表。</p>
<h3>曹操帶兵下江南</h3>
<p>— 學范</p>
<p>誰不那麽說呢，小弟弟小妹妹們喜歡聽講故事，比吃飯睡覺還看得着重呢！</p>
<p>我家的六弟，也和普通的孩子們一般的，不管來的是張家嫂嫂，或李家姊姊，他總扭着人家講故事。</p>
<p>有一天：徐家的表弟來說，六弟照例又是那麽中述他的請求：</p>
<p>「哥哥！你有什麽新鮮的故事講給我聽聽嗎」？</p>
<p>「有！我來講曹操下江南的故事」。</p>
<p>「好的！你講！」</p>
<p>六弟嘴角邊掛了甜蜜的笑意，表弟也那麽笑嘻嘻地開講了：</p>
<p>「話說從前曹操，丨丨你知道曹操嗎？」表弟突然挿一句問。</p>
<p>「知道知道！」六弟忙說，「是奸人不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的！那時他和周瑜打仗，曹操帶了八十萬人馬下江南，浩浩蕩蕩」：說至此，六弟帶着異樣的笑意。</p>
<p>「這八十萬人馬，忽然要經過一座小木橋，八十萬人馬一個個的過去，走了第一個，再走第二個：走了第二個，再走第三個：：：的的篤篤，：：：的的篤篤，：：：」</p>
<p>六弟聽了發急道：「這八十萬人馬走過了怎麽着呢？」</p>
<p>「八十萬人馬一時那裏走得完，走了第三個，再走第四個：走了第四個；：：：：的的篤篤，：：；的的篤篤，：：：」</p>
<p>「那走到明天也走不完了！」六弟憤憤了。</p>
<p>「自然，是一座小木橋！那能快呢？」表弟狡黠地笑。</p>
<p>「好了好了！」這次算六弟無聊地自己表示不要聽，悄悄的走了。</p>
<h3>人身上兩種沒有用的東西</h3>
<p>— 寗自强</p>
<p>小朋友：凡物愈用愈靈，不用則廢於機器固然，於人的身體的器官，又何獨不是如此？比方說：人所以有知識，就全靠腦器官，獸類之所以沒有知識，就是不會運用他的腦器官的緣故，但是我們人身上有兩種東西，因不用他而漸歸淘汰，像盲腸，和足趾，就是純粹沒有用的東西啊？</p>
<p>（一）盲腸：盲腸是大腸的上段，上接小腸，下連結腸，因爲我們的祖宗，以前在洪荒時代，是芻食的，所以就要經過盲腸，後來改變肉食，盲腸就成爲贅瘤，一樣的東西，並有發炎的危險，不割足以致命。</p>
<p>（二）足趾：足趾也是我們的祖宗攀緣樹木而用的，後來漸歸淘汰，以致縮短退化成寸長的東西，將來是要完全消滅的啊！</p>
<h3>鐘話</h3>
<p>— 心雨</p>
<p>小朋友，在無論什麽時候，你不是利用鐘做你的工作。但是，原始的時候有沒有鐘？鐘是那裏來的？你不是很喜歡知道嗎？</p>
<p>最初的時候世界上沒有鐘，人民利用太陽的影子和星辰的位置來計算時候，後來聰明些了，用燃着的蠟燭來測量過去的時間。</p>
<p>發明鐘要算巴比倫爲最早，大概在二千八百年前的時候，不過，那時候的鐘是沒有指針的，是靠着太陽才可應用的極簡陋的日𣌿儀，晚上用從壼裏流出來的水計算時間，或者用牛奶，有的還用沙。</p>
<p>後來發明了水鐘，裝製比流水的壼精美得多，鐘都刻好度數，但是很不普及，只有貴族才可用。</p>
<p>十字軍東征以後，由巴力斯旦帶去了一種有錘的鐘，這是鐘的大進步，但是不知道是誰發明的，六百五十年前倫敦議院上有了一架塔鐘，世界上有塔鐘出現，這是第一。</p>
<p>在二百五十年前世界上有了手提的鐘，接着，又出現了錶，再幾年伽利略將錘又改了擺，於是鐘更加精美眞確子。</p>
<p>此後還有分針長到三公尺半的鐘，有機械動物能奏琴報時的鐘，還有能指示日期及星辰地位等等的鐘，小朋友，你以爲奇怪嗎？但是，不要奇怪。世界上更奇怪的更精美的鐘，的發明者就是你們！</p>

<h3>光</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>我們看見火燒的時候，發生熊熊的光，這光從那裏來的呢？這是熱度達到最高度的表現，光射到我們眼睛裏，它是進行直綫的。所以當我們在電影院裏看電影的時候只要前面有」件東西遮住，我們就看不清楚了。但是光遇着物件阻擋以後，就能折回而進行，這種現象，呌做光的返射，假定你和一位小朋友，在沙地上離十餘尺的距離相對站着，在中間放一塊板，將球擲在板上，這球一定如（圖二）的反跳，站在你對面的朋友，就會接着球，他拍到板上的時候，你能够接着球，所以你如站在離面稍偏的地方，看不見自己的像，而可以看見旁邊人的像，這就是光的反射作用，如在鏡的正面，就能够看見自己的像，和球直向下拍，而仍舊如原方向上跳一樣的道理。（圖一）</p>
<p>光的反射，可以搆成鏡。我們普通用的都是平面鏡，假如用不是平面的東西，那光的反射就不同，你用洋鐵罐，和銅的調羹照之你的臉看，一定很滑稽的。所以有人利用凸凹鏡來做成哈哈鏡。（圖三四）</p>
<p>我們拿根鉛筆斜放在盛水的碗内，看起來鉛筆好像向上彎曲的。（圖五）其實鉛筆放在水裏，並沒有什麽變化，而是因爲光的曲折所致，這理由很簡單的，如圖五所示，光從Ａ到Ｃ出於水面時，向着Ｄ曲折進行，所以沿ＣＤ直綫看的時候，彷佛Ａ上浮到Ｂ一樣，所以挿在水中的鉛筆，好像上浮，假如你把鉛筆挿在玻璃杯裏，隔着杯壁看起來。好像鉛筆斷了（圖六）這是由水中鉛筆所發的光，從水中至空氣中時生了曲折的緣故。你可以拿一個銅元放在碗底，把碗放在桌上，慢的退到看不見銅元的時候站住，這時呌别人在碗裏注滿了，你就又可以看見銅元了，這是試騐光的曲折最好的方法。</p>
<p>光經過凸鏡的時候，現象却又變了，你如（圖七）的方法試騐一下看。燭火經過透鏡便倒立的，這是很有趣的玩意兒，理由等下次再說吧。</p>
<h3>蠅的自述</h3>
<p>— （陳逸眞）</p>
<p>我是一個蒼蠅，身上穿着一件亮晶晶的綠衣，頭是紅紅的，所以同類們很羨讚我的美麗。</p>
<p>我的性情，最喜歡，汚穢</p>
<p>的地方，垃圾桶，狗糞堆，西瓜皮，以及一切不潔的塲所，都是我繁殖種子的良地。</p>
<p>我的身上遍生着霍亂的毒菌，所以被我光顧的食物，都要留下一點病菌，使人們吃了，就要發生霍亂病。</p>
<p>因了這些綠故，人們看見了我，就要驅逐和傷害，呌我是霍亂的媒介物。</p>
<p>當我在吃東西及遊玩的時候，時時刻刻要防着人們的手掌和拍子，來光臨到我的身體。尤其要注意小孩子們，因爲他們喜歡捕捉我去喂螞蟻。</p>
<p>我能够哼曲子，曲名就呌，「嗡噏調」。假使我發現糞堆的時候，就得很愉快地哼着。曲子，來嘗試這新鮮的食品。</p>
<p>人們是聰明的，發明　幾種械器來捕捉我們，然而任你們怎樣地聰明，可是我們仍然嗡嗡地飛翔在垃圾桶邊。</p>
<h3>農村小友的通問</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>初秋</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>天空漸漸變高，時時襲來清爽的金風；尤其在早晨和傍晚，覺得十分凉快。那薰蒸的熱氣在最短期内，大概都要被肅清了。</p>
<p>聽呀！知了已沙着聲音，靑蚌擊起最後收軍的鼓兒，螢蟲也歛了光了；那麽，大地寂寞吧？不，决不！這時却是極熱鬧的世界：織布娘娘的「支札支札」，紡紗姑娘的「沙沙沙」瞿瞿瞿的蟋蟀，百蟲爭鳴，好似開了個秋季的音樂大會。</p>
<p>蟋蟀張了兩顎，遇到同類，恨命去鬥爭；抱着你死我活的精神，决了雌雄，得勝者振翼高歌，方肯收軍而返。這種「同類相殘」的行動，固然是不對的，但，對方旣有鬥意，爲維護自己性命計，那也顧不得什麽，只有奮力了！然則中國被强隣欺侮，居然拱拱手，也不來幾個回合，難道都沒有蟀蟋的勇氣嗎？小朋友！我們應該振奮起朝氣，誓不做蟋蟀不如的人」！「掮起我的槍，抵抗敵人去！」！天時在暗示着我們了。</p>
<h3>怎樣使毛筆頭不脫落</h3>
<p>— 滕錦標</p>
<p>小朋友：你們是不是看見毛筆頭脫落了，就非常懊惱嗎？因爲脫落了就不易裝上，但是我有一個方法，可以使它永久不脫落。現在寫在下面罷：</p>
<p>（一）到國藥店去買些松香，把它敲碎，然後放一些在已脫落筆頭的毛筆桿口内。</p>
<p>（二）在火上熏，使松香鎔解（當心燒着筆桿）。</p>
<p>（三）旋轉筆桿，使筆桿口内四周，都有鎔解的松香。</p>
<p>（四）當松香尙未凝固，立刻把筆頭慢慢挿入，再熏一會，過一些時候就牢了。</p>
<p>這樣裝上以後，雖浸在水裏，或用力地揮動，都不會脫落了。諸位小朋友，不妨去試試看。</p>
<p>（一）一枝新鉛筆</p>
<p>（二）計畫怎樣使用</p>
<p>（三）削了可以畫圖畫</p>
<p>（四）越削越短</p>
<p>（五）銘心永遠是要斷的</p>
<p>（六）事情是這樣結束！</p>

<p>主席報吿　行禮如儀、首由主席潘局長報吿、略謂、兒童幸福會及兒童晨報社因鑒於市上小書灘到處都是、灘上書籍大部份供兒童借閱、此可證明兒童識字者總喜歡看書、但灘上小書、因内容不善、使小孩閱後、生不良影響、關係甚大、同時社會上又無專供兒童閱讀之正當圖書館、故特聯合創辦兒童圖書館兩所、選適當的書籍、供給兒童閱讀、指導共正當智識、以補學校敎育之不足、我們並希望到兒童圖書館來閱書的、不但在學校的學生、一般沒有機會入學或已經停學的兒童、我們更歡迎他們來兒童圖書館現在只有兩所、將來當然要隨時擴充並普及、使和小學校一樣普遍、但有的小學裏已有圖書室、這種圖書完全是供學校中的學生看的、我們希望各校能打破學校界限、把學校裏的圖書也能供給學校以外的兒童看、那末其效力當然更普遍了這不特是補助學校敎育之足、而且可以把學校敎育推擴於學校以外了、其次我們還要辦流動出借用書車將圖書運送到各馬路免費給兒童看、這種方法其實各學校亦可以辦理、其力量才大、有了這種看書的地方、對於以往那種不良的小書灘、就可逐漸淘汰了、最後我們更希望、將來每個兒童圖書館内、至少要有一個或二三十個導師、來指導兒童閱讀、這樣兒童圖書館就等於是小學校了我們要想把學校以外的兒童得到智識、非推行此種事實不可云云、</p>
<p>籌備經過　次由第二館長錢弗公報吿籌備工作經過、略謂第一第二兩兒童圖書館、籌備時間共費三月、兩館開辦費係由市政府撥給五百元、經常費則由兒童晨報社月給五十元、徵募書籍蒙本市各大書坊踴躍捐助、現計合得五千餘册、現第一館設在和安小學内、第二館則在南市蓬萊路近津坊云、</p>
<p>各界致詞　繼由公安局代表殷冠之致詞、市敎育局代表胡叔異致詞、略謂外國對於兒童事業非常重視、有兒局之設立、專管兒童一切事宜、我國目前對於此種組織尙難辦到、而兒童幸福會是由各機關設立、其性質與外國之兒童局相似、專爲兒童謀幸福、今該會與兒童晨報社合辦兒童圖書館以增進兒童智識殊爲難得、希望各位小朋友要養成看書的習慣、常常到兒童圖書館去看書云、尙有新中國書局錢申之、和安小學許書紳等演說、從略、</p>

<h3>糧食粉麥跌風猛烈</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面又起巨大之跌風、以洋麥報價、芝加哥雖祗小三角左右、坎拿大好四八分不等、但市塲及業内外之人心、則形勢轉變、殊見激烈、以前月份之大量交割貨品、實銷均無問訊、完全爲套户取去、與最近之各實銷帶、因農村購買力之缺乏、進胃異常呆滯、兼之各廠生産不减、致積存之貨、愈益豐厚、故開價之後、市面即見大鬆、大廠又復順水推舟、一度猛出、近遠各期、一致猛落五七分不等、迨至下午開盤、市氣依然軟弱、内地帮因各處得雨、心思亦軟、各月份均有大批脫手、兼之阿麥定價祗五元四角六分、故中途又跌二三分不等、惟至收盤則以浮空抵補稍稍見佳、但以近况而言、因實銷之有限、洋麥有接近之勢、恐如前月份之猛漲局面、有望　莫及之概也、結果本月份較前月末收價、計跌八分二厘半、十月份跌九分、十一月份跌九分二厘半、十二月份跌九分、一月份跌八分半、二月份初開五角九分、收價亦跌四分七厘半、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份市面、均見一致慘跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥麥祗小三角左右、坎拿大好四八分不等、惟目麵粉之實銷停頓以來、小麥去化、亦隨之不振、各廠則粉積麥豐之餘、亦姑作壁上觀、不欲爭進、此中形勢、凡屬業中人早認爲非跌不可之勢故開價時、本月份尙開至八角、旋則買户脫手甚湧、繼續下降、以後則受粉價鬆落之影響、又復步跌、至收盤左右、已一致跌一角以外、迨至下午開盤、因多頭仍思暢脫、阿麥喊價、又見低宜、祗五元四角六分、致人心一致向下、出入甚覺熱鬧、惟各盤跌度、則較上午稍形和緩、至回顧八月份之最高市値祗九十兩月之差跌、已達九角、可見無理性之高漲必須受同樣之反動也、結果本月份猛跌一角八分、十月份跌一角九分、十一月份跌一角八分、十二月份跌一角六分、一月份跌一角二分、</p>
<h3>洋客秈續跌一二角</h3>
<p>丨客帮内地完全停辦丨</p>
<p>昨洋客秈市况、客帮内地一律停手、本街胃口亦淡、囤户祇有期貨交易、現貨反有回出、市面開市即軟、且長江方面亦得透雨、來源逐見加多、内地自得雨後秋禾極佳、人心已定、早稻已多收獲、暫時尙有前辦存米、不需再行運辦、市上存到旣多、消化反少、市價隨不得不步落一二角、幸市價小後囤户不忍脫手、本街趁小收買、市</p>
<p>面又得站住、統市開各路客秈二千五百包、現洋米七百包、期貨二百噸、小絞與安南粳存到兩少、市價尙可站定、客秈來源漸多、價乃步下、期貨有囤多回出九月份西貢祇五元二角三分、十月份五元三角、較之上之月底又小一角、</p>
<h3>杜洋尖新價見削</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源仍祗十號、貨共千四五百石、市况因天時雨後轉晴、人心較軟、是以銷</p>
<p>高料者站定、惟中次已見修數分矣、而杜洋尖除陳貨亦無榮辱外、其新貨則以去路有限、俱見猛削二三角之譜、陰變元無軒輊、至新梗至此以貨乏、亦無上落、廠東新仍開十一元六角、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源十五六號、市上各貨去胃白粳平常、早薄稻新客尖交易呆滯、洋杜尖略交、市價白粳白元早薄稻及東新粳定勢、洋杜尖新陳客尖帶疲、</p>
<h3>油市柏油漲價之主因</h3>
<p>柏油適當秋銷、各處均向漢口採辦、以供淘户需用、而漢市存積本不雄厚、且因天時炎熱、各産地之貨不能裝運、致漢市來源、未能麕集、而産客亦未到漢、故辦者雖有需要、然售者幾寥若晨星、近日麻城油竟高喝至十五元五角、其實並非市面如是、因泰豐係客貨、而客家未到、行家不敢擅專、故意提高價格、以退辦者、大概必須待秋凉後客貨麕集、客人到齊、則始有正式盤面也、重荆每砠在十五元二三角、平荆十四元七八角、交易亦不多、大略情形與麻城亦相彷耳、浙柏油因嘉興一帶天時九亢旱、年令大欠、蓋照樹頭結子、將來祗有二三成可收、所以禾本油已飛漲至每擔二十二元、本埠行家雖有繼續向漢市採辦、而數亦不多、因鑒於江浙兩省旱災若是之重、秋冬銷塲勢必大减特减、故亦不願多備、售價已漸次增加重荆每砠十九元、平荆十八元四角、麻城油十七元、</p>
<h3>花生豆油萎疲日甚</h3>
<p>花生油及豆油市况、勢居萎疲日甚之局、昨市祇花生油做開四百五十件、計泊兒油五十件、價爲十一元六角、决倉油四百件、價爲十一元四角行情比前市跌六角、油市之不振、因内地河道旱裂、舟船不通、致去路無人過問、所靠本街一路走化、故市氣一時恐不易轉醒、刻下底積堆豆油見多、約計大小　萬餘件、花生油存一千餘件、</p>
<h3>疋頭黑紫羔絨貨缺特漲</h3>
<p>昨呢絨交易、零躉俱暢、標凖市盤仍與上前日相彷、市勢最俏活者、首推黑紫羔絨、按市上存底大缺、川帮搜羅旺辦、售價因之飛漲、上年售六元許之黃黑紫羔絨、現一律飛漲至七元外、頭號爲九元二角半、其市情之俏、可謂最近呢絨類之冠、然九元餘之頭號貨、本街交易不多、因買方多嫌貴束手、而二號貨則供不敷求、幾有斷檔之處耳、</p>
<h3>五金英白鐵貶價競爭</h3>
<p>反比日貨爲廉</p>
<p>近來本埠薄白鐵市面、悉操於日貨乎中、蓋其價格較之英美諸貨便宜、因此客帮及建築帮等均樂與成交、拆兌行家亦因其易於出乎、所以多與之談判、是以英貨趨勢異常岑寂、美貨則因物質之優良尙能敷衍、故價無大影響、但英國廠家因見環境不良、受日貨之打擊、不得不廉價競爭、故其便宜貨聞於本月中旬可到、數達二萬餘張、行情七尺合一元一角二三分、六尺合九角二三分光景、觀之日貨來價、最低要一元二角五六分、（七尺）及一元零三四分、（六尺）便宜要一角多一張、故將來英貨出路之暢達、定可預卜也）</p>

<p>六十餘年未有的奇熱，使得人日復一日地「但屈指西風幾時來」。而今凉了，一雨便含秋意。</p>
<p>這新秋帶給我們一些歡喜，又一些憂疑。</p>
<p>每一：秋凉了婦女們再不會赤足裸腿，也不會跳入有男子的浴塲去游泳，這一來風化或可望轉移，省得各地的官長們焦頭爛額地操心。</p>
<p>第二：依「春秋繁露」所說：「春氣愛，夏氣樂，秋氣嚴，冬氣哀」。處今亂世，志士銷沉，大都沉溺於變愛與享樂；挽此頽風用傷人的哀思也自不行，唯有嚴肅的秋氣，最爲對症。</p>
<p>可是另一方初秋正當新穀登塲，像今年，天喪（？）吾民，水旱交作，不知有幾個農家，拾得到豐漏的稻穗？這霉頭誰該首先觸着？全家老老少少服毒懸樑之前，總不免是賣女兒，賣女兒，出賣女兒。於是而大都市丨丨尤其是華洋雜處的上海，更將是雛妓充斥。</p>
<p>再說東北方面，自九月十八日淪亡以來，三年千零日所遭的苦痛，可謂深長丨而今則靑天白日的旌旗，已自無由望得；遙想那兒的婦女，怕莫是含羞忍辱，學着那溥儀的老婆，嬌滴滴地歌唱僞國國歌罷。</p>
<p>這些内外的傷心的情形，正應每一個男人女人，挺身投入社會，訓練各項的技術才能，以爲自救救國的地位。而不料剛有極少的人能步出門外自食其力的當兒，便遭逢了「婦女應返於家庭」的橫流！</p>
<p>美國飛行家白郎女士，因爲在這兒找不着同志，已於數日前悄然離華。我們（婦女）的人，無論甚麽地方，都是給人失望。卽如有他國的女思想家，女敎育家，女革命家，女社會事業家，老遠地跑來，她除了遇得到可憐惜或可憎惡的妓女和摩登層而外，又能在我們的婆婆媽媽羣中，找得到甚麽同志呢？</p>
<p>我們的人是準定雌伏了！一切安内攘外，發號衝鋒的職責，都屬望於一二上峯，這還成甚麽一個民族戰綫的陣法？</p>
<p>凉秋九月，遍野的啼鴻，飢渴之外又將有寒凍的壓迫；凉秋九月，敵人新肥的廐馬，更將向我們的田園内騁馳。而我們的人，郤正隨流雌伏，雌伏到閫外事不聞不問的無能的地位：不欲盡四萬萬人的機能，一字兒排齊以救四萬萬人的民族。這兒是這般地浪費與無識！</p>
<h3>我也來談談「賢母良妻」制</h3>
<p>— 梨瑚</p>
<p>前期的「賢母良妻」制篇中，芸綺女士痛斥的幾點，我不能同意。茲特駁釋之：</p>
<p>女士痛斥這種制度，「爲中世紀封建社會的産物，爲男子利用以約束婦女爲爲其片面的性慾之具，是一種爲男子利用來拘縛女子成爲家庭奴𨽾的最狡猾的手段，凡讚頌賢母良妻制的，即是向歷史開倒車」。</p>
<p>這一點，女士首先犯了「賢母良妻」四字的曲解，和沒有認清時代的錯誤。這「賢母良妻」制，確是中世紀封建社會的産物，在那時，確有那樣偏見的錯誤的觀念。乃女士不知歷史是前進的，凡一種制度制的産生是有相當的社會背景的時間性的，就是必須適應於社會環境的需要，方能推行而被人擁護。於是它的解釋，也往往隨時境的變換而更易。女士沒有認清現社會的環境是不需要這種制度的採用，更沒有考究這賢母良妻四字的意義的眞髓是什麽，便主觀地盲從曲解，以致引起對於這種制度的深痛惡絕。這才是忘却了時間性，是向歷史開倒車。</p>
<p>這「賢母良妻」制，按現代的解釋，它的意義的眞髓，我以爲：賢母是訓敎兒子的有方者，良妻是男子利益的扶助者。確是負擔家庭一切瑣務，及兒女的生養敎育之責。然而决不是絕對服從，任勞任怨，至死不辭之謂。那麽，我們先考查目下社會的環境，是否需這種「賢母良妻」的制度，也就是它的意義的眞髓。是否適合於現代性。</p>
<p>我們按目下社會的環境看來，所謂解放後的，要求與男子各方面享受同等權利的婦女，差不多都不男子經濟收入部份的大宗消耗者，對於兒女方面，大半皆委於奶媽，而自己抱放任的不管主義。其欲脫銬梏人的枷鎖，合乎「賢母良妻」的意義的眞髓的，蓋亦希矣。試問解放後的流毒，有甚於此者乎！</p>
<p>實際採用的「賢母良妻」制，賢母，應以有方的訓養兒子的義務爲目標，而用心督促上進；良妻，應以家庭的利益爲前提，而共同合作，扶助，奮鬥爲意志。將來兒女與家庭爲國的柱石與中堅，爲賢母者，眞宜以諄諄敎訓，循循善誘爲天職；爲良妻者，眞宜以扶助丈夫，增進家庭利益爲原則；庶合貧弱煥散如我國的社會的需要。並不是以三從四德爲矢志。如是則解放與平等俱全，權利與管理共享，其於長期奮鬥中已經獲得的某些成果（如婚姻自由權，遺産權，選舉權：：）非特全不繳還，抑且根深底固了。那麽芸綺女士所說的：「凡主張恢復賢母良妻制的人，實際就是主張恢復中古封建時代的家庭制，及其附帶之一切，壓迫婦女的工具」。斷視。非惟不確，抑且落空了。</p>
<p>至於說我國的鄉村的農民家庭，在資本家嚴酷剝削與壓迫之下，在長期的不斷的失業之下，因爲妻子出外作女士當娘姨，整個家庭已弄得妻離子散，更談不上什麽「賢母良妻制」。我以爲我國農村家庭的婦女，從文化的水平凖上看來，是談不到什麽經濟，政治，和文化各方面與男子享受同等權利，但對於現代性的「賢母良妻」制的意義我的眞髓，却無不合。</p>
<p>男耕女織，不是以家庭的利益爲前提而共同合作，扶助，奮鬥爲意表的嗎？不僱奶媽而</p>
<p>在這樣剝削與壓迫之下，不忍坐視丈夫兒女的束手待待斃，寗願抛夫别子，出外作工僱傭，盡力扶助，可以說不是賢母良妻的至上的表現，而說是家庭的奴𨽾嗎？惟有這樣，才是各盡所能，旣解放，又平等。</p>
<p>從上面幾點看來，是否這賢母良妻制違反客觀的事實呢，是否應該抗議的呢，是否是我們開歷史的倒車而不與歷史前進呢，是否是愚民政策呢。我怕芸綺女士的論斷，是反要被歷史的車輪所輾碎了！</p>
<h3>蘇聯的妻子（續）</h3>
<p>— ＡｕｎａＬｏｕｉｓｅＳｌｒｏｎｇ著亮秋譯</p>
<p>蘇聯婦女不因爲做了妻子而得到尊敬；就是大人物的妻子也不會因她的丈夫而受到尊敬。當史太林的妻子死了，新聞紙上黑緣的哀悼寫着她自己的名姓和事業，祗附帶的說她是史太林的伴侶和同志。加利寗的妻子因爲創設了國家農塲和阿爾太山的文化中心而得到她的聲譽。在蘇聯，結婚是幸福的，但並非是事業的泉源。</p>
<p>蘇聯婦女的前程和聲譽，不是因爲做了妻子，而是因爲做了公民才得到的。家庭事務，在美國幾乎是一種正當的職業，在我們看來只是不値得尊崇的小事。家庭中的雜役由夫婦二人共同負担。至於色彩，美術，音樂我們用以點綴公共塲所，如文化公園，休息所，劇塲和工塲的俱樂部。</p>
<p>我們的生活情形；常使到蘇聯來的美國工程師或工人們的妻子壓倦。當男子們在工廠中津津有味的工作時，他們的妻子就感到孤寂和乏味。她們的榮譽的職業丨丨替丈夫佈置一個美滿的家庭，在蘇聯是不需要了。在男子服務的工廠中，視她們爲障礙物。一次，一個外交部首領對我說：「這些女子（指美國工程師或工人們的妻子）常到辦公室來纏擾，因爲她們的丈夫是個有用的人，就自以爲是了不起的人物。有什麽了不起，就是史太林的妻子也不算了不起！寄生蟲，祗會消費，不會生産的寄生蟲，怎樣的妨礙有價値的工人們的時間！」這些女子，最後或者也找到了職業而從中得到樂趣，或拉了她們的丈夫回美國去。</p>
<p>我們雖沒有做妻子或做管家婦的榮譽，但在做公民而工作中和男子同樣的享有一切榮譽的權利。在蘇聯的國境内，隨處有女子的地位；妻子做村長，集合農塲長，商會主席，工廠指導，法庭裏的法官，醫生或工程師都有。在工作中簡直沒有性的區别；學校和大學都收女生。女子在任何職業中和男子同樣的工作，得到和男子同樣的工資。近乎有一百個女子已得了紅星勳章，這種勳章是給蘇聯軍事上有高深造就的人的。有許多女子已得到了公民榮譽，列寗勳章和紅星勳章。有六千個女子做集合農塲的塲長，十萬個被選爲法庭人員，四十萬個做地方蘇維埃的官員。醫校中女生占全體的七十一又四，預料將來的醫生大部是女性的。女子有到北極去探險的。亞倫羅雪諾伐是第一個女的北極探險家，她在冰天雪地中過了一年，在亞比利柯夫號破冰船上航行亞洲東北和西北的二條路綫。有人遇到許多蘇聯的女地理學家在世界的頂點。一個女子在切留斯金號破冰船上生了個兒子。</p>
<p>在世界各國發展很慢的女子獨立運動，在蘇聯因爲工業的迅速發展而跟着很快的發展了</p>
<p>丨農田，在五年中聯合成爲機械化，工業化的集合農塲了，在那裏，女子和男子同樣的工作而得到酬報。在蘇聯政治下最後感覺到婦女有平等權利的農婦們，漸漸知道她們要有獨立的收入的意義了。</p>
<p>因爲集合農塲的創設，從列寗格勒到海參威的三千萬農婦，覺得沒有丈夫也能安然度日。男子們的最後堡壘丨丨一個舊式的家庭，男子中心，父系的家庭，爲了女子的平等和獨立而交了末運。這恐怕是蘇聯以外國家中的道德家所最痛心疾首的。</p>
<h3>父母大學與賢母良妻</h3>
<p>— 斐</p>
<p>良和賢，本都是很好的字眼，不過只曰賢母良妻，而不曰良夫賢父，已經可疑，旣曰賢母良妻矣，又標爲主義，又從而提倡之，就更覺其有些玄虚了，難道就是所謂：「確認男女平等之原則，助進女權之發展」麽？莫明其土地堂也，自從「婦女回到家庭裏去」這一口號提出，夫然後。「賢母良妻主義」的作用和意義這才明白。好吧，要回到家庭去就回到家庭裏去。可是回去幹甚麽呢？農已破産，工多無家，且不去說他。說有家的話：「嗯哼！倒杯茶來！」「拿支香烟過來丨燃上火！」似乎神氣十足，不嫌醜麽？舖床疊被，洒掃庭廚，女的固然會做，男的也不見得幹不來，說到穿：西服固爲良妻素不嫻習，中式也還是裁縫老師做的有樣子，襪子，布縫的久已夫沒有人穿了，鞋呢，不論是布的皮的也是鞋店裏出品來的合式，而巾，不用說無須再煩内人丨良妻罣心，就是小如手帕子，式樣之新，花色之多，市塲也有的是丨而且價廉物美。說到吃：米麵飯食以至茶點，稍可口的早已要到街坊買去了，至於菜餚，事事物物，再賢的内助，也趕　廚子，而在工業社會，酒家，菜館，包飯作，簡直有代替家庭廚房之勢「所謂中饋」也者，時代老人，似乎有意要呌牠有名無實了，說到兒女情腸：這本來是人同此心，就應該事得其平，如果她們也說：你也一天到晚在家裏伴着我吧！咱們什麽都别幹了吧！這還成個世界麽？良妻之無從做起也，有如是夫。那末，再說賢母：妻一生了孩子，便獲得了母的尊號，夫於是乎也就父起來了。固然，夫是養不來孩子的，然而關於養孩子，在夫一方面也是關係很大的。譬如生理衛生和惟的衛生這一些知識他不曉得，就會給母與子的不幸或災害，孩子生下了，要撫養，要敎育，因之而需要賢母。究其實，由夫而父的傢伙，除了沒有奶汁外，賢母的任務，他們不惟幹得來，而且能幹得很好。拿繁重的事來說吧：撫養孩子最難的，莫過於對付小兒疾病，以上海爲例，最好的小兒科醫生是他們而不是她們。其次是敎育，遠的不用說首創幼稚園的德人Ｔｒｏｅｂｅｌ不是女的。即以中國兒童敎育專家而論，不也首推陳鶴琴男士麽？至於洗尿布，換屎包，以至於抱抱逗逗之類瑣事，更是不分男女，凡人都能，只有幹不幹而已，於此可見母而賢，不惟女的能而男的尤其能，我覺得：懷孕十月，臨産又復出死入生，女子母性的任務，也算盡其最難最大者了。孩子生出以後，就交由男的撫育，豈不很公平的麽？</p>
<p>從上面所說的事實，我們知道：所謂「家事，」因人類的演化，社會的進步，以前家庭的事務，多已變爲社會工業。以前婦女的職責，多已變爲專門的知識，以前認爲婦女該做的事，現在男子也都會做丨以前責之婦女必需做</p>
<p>（如撫育嬰兒），現在男子也有些很樂意的幹了而且幹來很出色。這是事實吿訴我們：良妻賢母時代是過去了！婦女們回到家庭裏去，是沒有什麽可幹了！爲了人類幸福丨尤其是爲小孩子們，我們應該有更適合於現代的敎育了！這，我們除了不分男女一律施行「人的」敎育外，該另辦一種「父母學校！」</p>
<p>「父母大學」，這是蘇俄最近創設的，（在六月底各報都曾登載，這個新聞晨報的晨曦上還寫過一篇文章，）已經引起國人注意。蘇俄是個鼓勵婦女到社會上來的國家，據說他們大學裏的女生，有三分之一以上，有國家憑證的婦女科學家，總數有七千人。做國家科學機關首領的，有九十多人！婦女作技術發明而獲得登記的計二萬起！在衛生機關，敎育機關的婦女們更多。其他農工政警各界都有婦女們參加，是早經我們習知的。這就證明：婦女只合在家庭管家撫育孩子，完全是一種偏見丨不合事實。他們丨蘇俄注意兒童幸福，不亞於各國，至少不弱於我們。他們爲了兒童公育，普遍地有了「托兒所。」那末，創辦」父母大學」，顧名思義，不用說，是爲他們小國民着想的。</p>
<p>以學校的敎育，用科學的知識，敎人以爲父母的一切智能，使每一受敎者，獲得專門學識，在家庭好，到社會也好。這豈是片面的不適時代的「賢母良妻敎育」所可相提並論的嗎？所以我以爲：於其瞎喊什麽「賢母良妻」敎育，不如倡辦「父母大學」爲是。</p>
<h3>上海市第一託兒所訪問記</h3>
<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>小孩們健康異常</p>
<p>家屬可高枕毌憂</p>
<p>上海兒童幸福會主辦的第一託兒所，開辦到現在，雖然已將數月，記者因困於生活的始終沒有跑去參觀過，日前特乘參加孔子紀念大會之便，驅車前往，走進會客室，該所的楊所長，就笑容可掬的迎了過來，手裏揮着一把大蒲扇，看樣子，至少也得上五十歲的人了，精神却依稀和年靑人一樣。</p>
<p>坐定後，照例地寒喧了幾句，隨着，我就急急地把想知道的，盡可能地問了。</p>
<p>據楊所長誠摯的回答：「該所的組織很簡單，所長一人是盡義務的，此外，辦事員一人，保姆主任一人，助敎一人，看護六人，奶媽四人：保姆主任和助敎是專管敎學方面的，看護呢，全是醫藥學校出身，專管保育的。</p>
<p>「全所的孩子，總數是六十個（其中嬰孩佔一半）分三組敎養，從初生到一歲算是嬰兒，一歲到三歲是幼兒，三歲到六歲的是幼稚生（六歲僅一人）。孩子們的日常生活：上午六時起床，九時進牛奶，十時午餐，飯後休息片刻後幼稚生上課下午一至三時，全體午睡，三時後游戲，六時半晚餐，七時半就寢，孩子們的家屬，大都以學界佔多數，商政軍次之。</p>
<p>「經濟方面，每一月支出是一千元，學費收入僅四百數十元，因此，雖每個孩子收費八元，實際上所裏還貼的很多，先是代乳粉一項，平均一個孩子就得十二元左右了。</p>
<p>「設備方面，普通的都有了，唯一的缺惑是沒有花園。」</p>
<p>至此，記者覺談話已稍可吿一段落，就站起了身，要求往各室參觀。</p>
<p>「歡迎呵！」楊所長沒等我的話說完，也就與奮立了起來。</p>
<p>起始我們參觀了盥洗室膳室和敎室，那裏都佈置得怪簡潔的，隨着，我們就踏上了樓梯。</p>
<p>「楊所長，近來外面很有些謠言，說孩子們進來後都瘦了些，該不是眞的吧」偶兒記憶起了一個朋友的閒話，邊走又這樣問。</p>
<p>「唔！」楊所長似乎有些驚詫，但接着就很鎭定的說：「這可以說一半是謠言，一半呢，有些誤會，譬如說你家有個孩子，一旦換了新的奶媽，那時，孩子因爲生理和乳汁的關係，不是也要瘦些嗎？所以我們所裏，卽使有時有一二個較瘦的孩子，至多也僅是這原因，當然，我不是說我們辦的一定怎樣好，但實際上：：？呵，我可吿訴你，瘦的孩子，日前是一個也沒有，好在事實立刻就會給你證明，你瞧吧。」</p>
<p>這時，孩子們的寢室，已在我們眼前展開了。因爲時間正値午睡，所有的孩子都安睡地睡着。</p>
<p>室内的光綫很柔和，小小的鐵床齊整地排列着，當我們的腿跨進房門後，醒着的孩子，就都仰起了嘻嘻的臉兒，鳥子骨溜骨溜地向我們瞧，嫩白的小手，儘自向兩旁的欄柱床着，活潑，健康，看了眞不由得從心底裏泛上了一個滿意的微笑，這些孩子，誰能說是瘦弱呵？</p>
<p>走到嬰兒室，這裏更特别地惹人憐愛了。每個小天使，都深深地沉睡着。靠門邊的一隻搖籃中，據說睡着的，就是野貓王人美女士才生的小貓。</p>
<p>臨走，記者爲使一現中國是否急切需要託兒所」這個問題，得到更切實的解答起見，又問了一下關於記養的原因，承楊所長給我瞧了一個新近的統計表，現在把來抄在下面，以供學者的研究。</p>
<p>因職務牽累　　　一八</p>
<p>欲受良好敎育　　一二</p>
<p>因家務紛繁　　　　六</p>
<p>不信賴乳母　　　　七</p>
<p>因兒女過多　　　　五</p>
<p>母過無人照料　　　四</p>
<p>母病　　　　　　　三</p>
<p>因學業不能兼顧　　二</p>
<p>節省經濟　　　　　一</p>
<p>不過這不是勞働託兒所，眞正貧苦的勞働者的嬰兒幼孩，還不得其門而入。最後楊所長說，該所「所立不久，已吿人滿之患。」由此可證明現社會下託兒所的如此急需。</p>
<h3>乘凉雜談</h3>
<p>— 先</p>
<p>炎熱的夏晚，飯後常常是拿着把芭蕉扇，坐在弄堂裏乘凉，在這裏，沒有太太小姐們，一排坐着的都是娘姨和小大姐；跑着跳着的就是那些活潑的小孩子。</p>
<p>娘姨們互相談論，小大姐們一塊兒笑謔。她們天天見面，常常在弄堂裏歇息，混得爛熟的。只有我一個，是孤獨的。我默然坐着，機械地搖着扇子，但熱並不稍减；而心中的煩燥，更加覺得熱不可耐。我有點羨慕那歡樂的一羣，她們談笑着，忘記了疲倦和熱的襲擊。我爲什麽不能參加她們的集團，和她們談笑呢？於是我走近小大姐那邊，逗引着嬰孩，和那個小大姐談話。但我馬上就覺到不舒服：她們對我一如對她們的主人一樣，懷着畏懼恐惑的心理；而我也不能不感到些微不安。</p>
<p>我們不能接近下層婦女，不能了解她們的苦痛，假若我們不能抛却那些身分一等一類的封建思想的話。</p>
<p>爲了要明瞭這些娘姨和小大姐的生活，我便常常找機會去和她們談話。現在有幾個還常常來找我替她們寫家信。我和她們混得很熟了。她們的生活眞的像她們自己所說的：「比黃連還苦三分」。但是她們的努力，奮鬥，在困苦的生活中掙扎的精神，實在使得我們佩服！因此，我要介紹幾位的談話給大家聽聽；倘或有同情她們的人，同聲替她們呌一聲苦，喊一聲寃，把她們的待遇改善一點，把她們的人格抬高一點，那就是我寫此篇文字的初意。</p>
<p>丨彭媽丨</p>
<p>彭媽是我的房東家裏的娘姨。她在東家帮了一年多了。她的姨姪女兒也在這裏做着小大姐，替房東太太領小孩。</p>
<p>她，年紀大約不過四十歲，湖南人，說着一口的土話。一雙小脚像腫爛的茄子，好像她從來不曾洗過脚，換過襪子，襪子上滿是灰。她每天幾乎全在廚房裏；天氣這樣熱，她必須在爐子旁烤火。早晨天還沒亮她就起來洗衣裳。六點鐘我起來的時候，她已經煮好稀飯，上街買菜去了。夜裏她又比任何人睡得晏些：她要等候太太到半夜十二點或一點回來後，才能安心睡覺。</p>
<p>一天，他從曬台上曬完衣服下來，經過我的房門；我便問她甚麽時候呌我寫信？她知道我有空工夫給她寫信了，便走進我的房裏坐下了。剛一坐下，就深深地嘆了一口氣。好像整天忙着透不過氣來，這下子坐着歇息，這才一口吐了出來似地。</p>
<p>「太太不在家嗎？」</p>
<p>「張太太家打牌去了。」</p>
<p>「你兒子的信寫得很有進步了。」（未完）</p>

The bandit crowds resisted and fled towards the border of Xinglong and Zunhua. The Zunhua militia is still tracking and pursuing them. Outside Yuguan's four suburbs, about a dozen large and small groups of bandits are lurking, all planning to take advantage of the situation to disrupt the city and suburbs. Su Yuqi, the director of the Shanhaiguan Public Security Bureau, has implemented new anti-bandit measures.

<h3>Gu Mengyu Went South Yesterday and Will Schedule Another Inspection Tour After Arriving in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Gu Mengyu left Beiping at 9:30 pm on the 1st via Tianjin to return to Nanjing. Provincial and municipal authorities and the railway bureau all went to the station to see him off. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gu Mengyu came to Beiping for more than a month. In addition to separately summoning responsible personnel from various railways to discuss the direction of railway development, he also negotiated the consolidation of loans for various railways. Regarding the loan for the Pinghan Railway, due to the excessive amount, after days of consultation, it was decided to do its best to promote railway affairs, arrange for bank loans to cover the consolidation funds, and repay them in installments on schedule. Only the principles have been agreed upon at this moment, and no signing has taken place. Gu received a telegram from Wang last night, urging him to return to the ministry to resume his duties as soon as possible to avoid prolonged vacancy in ministerial affairs. After receiving the telegram, Gu entered the city from the Western Hills this morning and separately summoned responsible personnel from various railways at Shen Chang's residence. At 6:50 this evening, Gu, accompanied by his wife, two sons and daughters, and Secretary Gu Xiwu, arrived at the station to board the train. Gu plans to disembark in Tianjin to visit Yu Xuezhong and then take the original train south to Nanjing at 10:45 pm. Ge Guangting, Chen Yanjiong, and others will leave Beiping within a few days. Gu stated, "I have been in Beiping for more than a month, and now that official and private matters have been completed and my vacation has ended, I will leave Beiping tonight via Tianjin. I plan to visit Chairman Yu for discussions, approximately for ten minutes, and then take the original train south to return to Nanjing. After arriving in Nanjing, I will schedule another inspection tour of various railways, first inspecting the Longhai Line, because that line is scheduled to be completed to Xi'an within this year. Regarding the Pinghan loan issue, there is this proposal, but the amount of the loan has not been determined. It has been decided to do our best to start with the amount of funds used for consolidation and to negotiate with the banking groups at any time. After submitting to the ministry for approval, the loan will be allocated. The consolidation plans for other railways have also been discussed and agreed upon with the directors of various railway bureaus and will be promoted separately without a fixed timetable. After I return to Nanjing, it is still undecided whether to visit Chiang Kai-shek in Lushan. Li Xiangen's visit to Beiping is to discuss and actively promote the completion of the Guangzhou-Wuhan Railway, to be fully completed before the year 26 of the Republic. Li will leave Beiping within a few days to participate in the joint meeting of the engineering offices of the southern section of this road, the Xiang-E section, and the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section in Wuhan on the 10th of this month to discuss the technical unification of the entire line."

<p>(Jinan) Gu Mengyu was originally scheduled to pass through Jinan with Ge Guangting on the morning of the 4th. The Jiaozhou Commissioner had planned to come to Jinan to wait for an audience, but it was canceled because Gu was anxious to go south and did not want to see many people along the way.

I will stay in Beiping for a few days, plan to visit relatives in Tianjin, and then return to Chahar.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Prospective and Retrospective Views on the Bandit Troubles in Northern Sichuan - Ting</h3>
<p>Examining the rampant banditry in Northern Sichuan, it originated in October of the previous year. At that time, the bandit Xu Xiangqian took advantage of the war among the Sichuan provincial armies against Liu (Wenhui) to flee from Shaanxi into Sichuan, sweeping through Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong. He directly descended upon Suining and Yilong, establishing the "Sichuan-Shaanxi Soviet Government" in Changchi, Nanjiang, proclaiming the title of the "Fourth Front Army of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army." He expanded his strength, growing from over ten thousand people to one hundred fifty to sixty thousand in just a few months. This did not even include the so-called "special detachments" and "guerrilla units." His rapid development surpassed that of the three bandits He (Long), Kong (Hechong), and Wu (Huanxian). The Sichuan warlords, from the two Lius downwards, including Deng, Tian, Li, and Luo, were all brave only in their selfish infighting, allowing the Red forces to grow unchecked and become a prairie fire. It was not until Liu Wenhui was defeated and fled to Xikang that Liu Xiang and others were honored with titles such as "Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression" and "General Commander," and began to feel the pain and planned their response. However, in the bandit areas of Northern Sichuan, the people killed by the bandits already numbered over a million. The tragic sacrifice, as commentators said, was unparalleled in the three hundred years since Zhang Xianzhong. Thinking of this, one cannot help but sigh and feel endless hatred.</p>
<p>Liu Xiang's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression occurred around December of last year, but the order for a general offensive was delayed until October 15. According to his plan, the bandit suppression military operations were divided into five routes. The first route, under Deng Xihou, targeted Nanjiang. The second route, under Tian Songyao, targeted Yilong. The third and fourth routes, under Li Qixiang, Luo Zezhou, and Yang Sen, targeted Yingshan. The fifth route, under Wang Lingji, targeted Suining and Yilong. The advance of the five routes should have been as interdependent as the cheek and axle of a cart, responding like fingers and arms. However, at the beginning of the campaign, cracks were already evident. Among the five routes, only the fifth route, the direct line of the Liu family, was most willing to fight. Therefore, they were able to take Suixuan in one fell swoop. The next best were the third and fourth routes, which were still able to respond tactically. However, the first and second routes seemed to be estranged, watching from the sidelines. Their motivation was nothing more than to preserve their strength for future use. Later, Deng and Tian, unable to withstand criticism from all sides, began to show some enthusiasm, successively recovering Zhaohua, Jiange, and the Yilong area. At that time, although the bandits' momentum had been slightly reduced, it was still not enough to deliver a fatal blow. Unexpectedly, Liu Xiang could not wait and took the lead in announcing the demobilization plan after the end of the bandit suppression military operations, and telegraphed the Central Government to abolish the Sichuan Provincial Government and replace it with a Rehabilitation Supervision Office as the highest authority in Sichuan. Although Liu Xiang stated that the demobilization was up to each army to decide and that he would not be demanding, the other warlords, inherently suspicious, could not help but feel that they would be discarded once they were no longer needed. The impact on the future of bandit suppression was not insignificant.</p>
<p>After the recovery of Suining and Yilong, the first phase of the offensive plan was barely completed. January 13 of this year was set as the date for the second full-scale general offensive. However, in terms of battle achievements, only the fifth route army's capture of the Madu Pass, the only natural barrier between Tongjiang, Bazhong, Yilong, and Suining, was somewhat commendable. Moreover, even in this battle, the main reason why our army was successful was still due to infighting within the bandit forces. The bandit Xu clearly saw that the bandit suppression army was internally fragmented and that only the fifth route army was its sole enemy. Therefore, he spared no effort to fight it with all his strength. At the critical juncture of the front-line military operations, many of the other routes still stood by and watched. Over a hundred prominent figures from Chengdu and Chongqing, including Zeng Jian and Hu Jingyi, could no longer tolerate it and telegraphed the generals, urging them to arouse their conscience. Their grief and anger overflowed in their words.</p>
<p>After the fifth route army marched directly towards Bazhong from Madu Pass, the second and third routes also joined forces there. However, the first route army alone faced the north, providing remote support, which was actually just a show of force. After Bazhong fell, the bandits retreated to Tongjiang. According to common sense, the bandit's arrogance might have been slightly reduced. However, because the bandit area was shrinking day by day and the defensive line was shortening, their combat power was instead concentrated. Xu and the bandits believed that the success or failure of Tongjiang was extremely important, so they did not hesitate to fight the fifth route army to the death with their backs to the city. In this battle, both sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the cliffs, charging back and forth, sometimes gaining, sometimes losing. The losses of the fifth route army were the most severe of all battles. Its division commander, Xu Yaoqing, sent a long telegram to Liu Xiang, stating that the bandit Xu relied on natural barriers and stubbornly resisted to the death. If no measures were taken to win over the hearts of the people and cause internal division, relying solely on force would likely make it difficult to eliminate them in the short term. After the Battle of Bazhong, the fifth route army advanced deep alone, seemingly entering the third phase of the bandit suppression military operations. However, the guest armies of each route failed to advance simultaneously, resulting in three general offensives against Wanyuan, wasting manpower and money. The results were not as good as the local militia and the "Holy Mother Corps" and other civilian armed forces. On August 17, Chiang Kai-shek sent a special telegram to Liu Xiang, instructing him to order the various armies to work hard to advance and strictly prohibit hesitation and watching from the sidelines. Otherwise, the respective commanders would be held accountable. Less than a week after this telegram was sent, on August 23, the news of the Liu army's disastrous defeat in the second battle of Wanyuan came swiftly. Liu was indignant and ashamed, and resigned. I have heard that Northern Sichuan is barren and lacks food, and the autumn harvest in the Wanyuan area usually occurs around the middle of August. With this new grain, the Red bandits have provisions and salaries. It will be even more difficult to quell the rebellion in the future.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the setback in the current bandit suppression military operations in Northern Sichuan was actually due to the failure of the five route armies to fully coordinate, resulting in wasted military spending and little achievement. Among them, the fifth route army was the most effective in suppressing the bandits, and its contributions cannot be denied. However, because it was the direct line of Liu Xiang, it was resented by the other armies. As for the other armies' watching from the sidelines, it is indeed worthy of criticism. However, in all fairness, if Liu Xiang could have known the way to win people over and not let them develop unfounded suspicions, it might not have been so. Moreover, we still remember that when the bandit Xu occupied more than ten counties in Northern Sichuan, his momentum was very strong. The various units of Tian, Deng, Yang, and Li were not secure from morning till night. Liu Xiang was indifferent. At that time, the bandit forces could have taken advantage of this situation to defeat them one by one. However, because they were eager to connect with He Long and urgently wanted to attack eastward, they were taken advantage of by Liu's forces. Therefore, Xiang himself cannot be considered an exception to the blame for the so-called failure to cooperate. A gentleman is lenient in blaming others and strict in blaming himself. I hope Xiang will calm down and reflect on himself. Recently, the Central Government has earnestly retained Xiang in his resignation and agreed to subsidize the Sichuan Province with 10 million yuan for bandit suppression. Liu Congyun, who is criticized by all parties and called a monster, has also telegraphed his resignation and the lifting of his position as the chairman of the front-line military committee. Perhaps the bandit suppression military operations in Northern Sichuan can have a turning point after this twist. However, the key to future success or failure still lies in the sincere cooperation of the various armies. This depends on the awakening of the various armies. In addition, regarding the bandit troubles in Northern Sichuan, there are two more things that should be noted. One is to strive to facilitate transportation in Eastern Sichuan and to build the section of highway from Wanxian to Yihan as soon as possible to facilitate military transportation. The second is to rigorously implement blockade measures in the border areas of Hubei, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan to prevent the Red bandits from fleeing. As for breaking the unique defensive zone system in Sichuan, prohibiting the pre-collection of land taxes, abolishing miscellaneous taxes, and unifying the currency system, all of which are related to the long-term stability of Sichuan Province, are not limited to bandit suppression, so I will not elaborate on them.</p>

According to diplomatic negotiations conducted by various countries last week, all member states of the League of Nations Executive Council, except Japan and Germany, have agreed to submit this draft to the General Assembly. Reports that the opinions of various countries are divided and will indefinitely delay Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations are insufficient to affect this informal coordination. The members of the Executive Council unanimously agreed on the following two points: ㈠ Welcome Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations; ㈡ Grant Soviet Russia a permanent council seat on the Executive Council. The reason is that the world is heading towards war, and Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations can make peace more hopeful. The Soviet Russian government has now submitted an informal application to prepare to join the League of Nations, on the condition of obtaining a permanent council seat on the Executive Council and appointing Soviet Russian people as important committee members. As for Poland's request to be a permanent council member of the Executive Council, nothing has been heard. The annual fee that Soviet Russia should pay is 3 million Swiss francs, exceeding only the United Kingdom. (National Telegram on the 31st)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Situation Regarding Soviet Russia Joining the League of Nations - Parisian Newspapers Consider It a Major Event</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to political news, after Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu met with French Foreign Minister Barthou, the issue of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations is much more optimistic. The League of Nations General Assembly will be held this month, and it is expected to obtain more than two-thirds of the majority. (National Telegram on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Barthou plans to go to Geneva on Wednesday or Thursday to attend the Executive Council meeting. However, if British Foreign Minister Simon delays leaving London until the League of Nations General Assembly, Barthou may also postpone his trip. The rumor that Barthou will go to Rome in the autumn to meet with Mussolini has now been confirmed. They will hold talks outside the League of Nations meeting, and most of the talks will focus on the preparations for the Rome meeting. King Alexander of Yugoslavia is about to visit Paris. The French government is actively negotiating with the capital of Yugoslavia regarding the reception arrangements. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu is currently in Paris and has met with Barthou. The topics discussed include the Austrian situation, the issue of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations, and negotiations on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. People in Paris say that the negotiations on Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations will definitely have good results and are quite optimistic. Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations will be decided by the League of Nations General Assembly, and only a two-thirds majority of members is required to pass. In addition, the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact is still being negotiated by the countries concerned, and it seems to require considerable time. However, Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations and the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact are negotiated separately, and there is no connection between them. In short, the meeting between Barthou and Titulescu was based on the spirit of friendship between the two countries, and they openly discussed the upcoming discussion to be held in Geneva on September 7. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Sofia The League of Nations General Assembly is about to open. The Bulgarian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Batolov, will depart for Geneva on September 3. Batolov recently issued a statement to the press, saying that Bulgaria is deeply concerned about the League of Nations and that the Bulgarian nation also expresses great faith in it, because the League of Nations has fortunately avoided many serious war dangers, and the League of Nations is striving to maintain the safety and independence of small countries. Moreover, the League of Nations has given Bulgaria valuable assistance in material terms. We will not forget this sincere treatment. In short, no matter what kind of financial, economic, social, and political issues, the League of Nations conducts objective research with the most generous spirit. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>The Hague If the issue of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations is submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly, what attitude will the Netherlands take? The government is considering this matter. What can be determined now is that the Netherlands will never oppose Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations. However, it is not yet known whether it will vote in favor or abstain. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Parisian newspapers published in the evening all have comments on Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations. The Times editorial stated that there are various benefits to Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations, but some people oppose it. If Soviet Russia does not join the League of Nations, what benefit is there to the international community? According to the Times, after Soviet Russia joins the League, its diplomatic methods will seek to adapt to the diplomacy of Western countries and abandon its Asian policy. Soviet Russia's accession to the League is necessary for international cooperation. Even if there are opponents, they cannot prevent Soviet Russia from joining. "Hard Line Report" believes that Soviet Russia's participation in international organizations has a major impact on the international situation, because Soviet Russia has a population of 180 million, which is an indispensable factor in maintaining the world's balance of power. We must not ignore it. In theory, Geneva cannot be without Soviet Russia. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers all regard Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations as the most important issue of this League of Nations session. Although Soviet Russia's accession to the League has encountered various serious difficulties, there is no doubt that it will be passed. What is unknown is whether it can get the unanimous approval of the Executive Council, so that Soviet Russia can occupy a permanent seat in the Executive Council. The Paris Echo newspaper stated that countries that sympathize with Soviet Russia must use all their strength to unite two-thirds of the majority vote in the General Assembly, so that the Soviet Russia accession plan can be passed. The People's Daily stated that for the sake of Soviet Russia's own interests and the interests of Europe and peace, Soviet Russia must join the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>

The exercise is scheduled to last until 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 2nd), practicing real combat day and night, and will show off its offensive and defensive strategies. This day coincided with the 11th anniversary of the Great Earthquake. Dropping incendiary bombs and deploying smoke screens, the various parts of the city would be transformed into battlefields. This situation is reminiscent of the situation at the time of the Great Earthquake. At night, blackout control will be implemented, completely without lights, making Tokyo completely disappear into the darkness. The tension of the scene will be beyond imagination. (United Press dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today is the first day of the Tokyo air defense drill. The Supervisory Department convened representatives of the defense corps of the 35 districts at Shiba Park at 10:00 AM to hold a final discussion. The various defense corps and the special corps of the various companies and department stores, women's army, and volunteer army were all ready, waiting for the enemy planes to attack. At noon, a wireless radio warned that the enemy planes were approaching, and the citizens were suddenly tense, preparing for the worst. At 1:00 PM, Tokyo Mayor Niizuka issued a warning on the radio, saying that the crisis in the imperial capital was becoming more urgent, and the people of the country must unite to protect the national territory. Then, the members of the various defense corps deployed everything in the rain, and the exercise did not begin until 3:00 PM. Because of the rain, the planes could not fly. However, the frequent warnings of enemy planes made the citizens tense. At night, the enemy planes attacked the imperial capital, so the anti-aircraft guns in various places and the exercise areas were quick to deal with poison gas and fire. The citizens participated enthusiastically and were extremely active. (Electric Electric dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Japan Attaches Unusual Importance to the Overturned Train Case on the China Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Suspects Soviet Russia of Planned Action</p>
<p>The Truth of the Incident is Awaiting Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The telegram of the Yi army attacking the train on the southern line of the China Eastern Railway, killing and injuring many people, arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had considered the many facts that the train had been turned over at the time when the negotiations for the transfer of the China Eastern Railway were stalled, and paid attention to the relationship with Russia. The incident was analyzed from the following perspectives: ㈠ The accidents that have occurred in the past have only occurred on the eastern line, intending for military trains. This time, it occurred on a passenger train, and although its nature is different, the plan is meticulous and organized; ㈠ The target of the attack is specifically aimed at Japanese and "Manchurian" people, while Russians are often unharmed. The current emphasis is on the relationship with Russia. As a result, Ambassador Hishikari was asked to thoroughly investigate, and after the cause is determined, it was decided to transfer it to diplomatic negotiations, and effective measures will be taken for future security guarantees. (Electric Communication dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Inspection of the Scene of the Incident (Harbin) The train robbery incident that occurred on the 30th on the southern section of the Eastern Railway was a rare tragedy in recent years. Especially since this case broke out in the safest southern section, and most of the victims were Japanese, it aroused unusual attention. Japanese reporters went to the scene of the incident to conduct on-site inspections, and took the ambulance that departed from Harbin at 10:30 AM on the 31st to rush to the scene. It was found that the location was ten kilometers south of Wujiatun Station, and there were small mountains on both sides of the railway, which was considered the most suitable place for hijacking a train. The joints of the railway tracks were all removed, and several trenches were dug at a distance of about half a kilometer from the railway. It can be seen that today's train robbery incident was a planned action. Moreover, there were suspicious Russian people on the ill-fated train. At the time of the tragedy, they had already fled without a trace. According to the passengers, at the time of the incident, screams of killing and slaughter were heard inside and outside the train, and Russian accents were heard in the Yi army. Combining the above situation, this case has to be regarded as a major one. (Japanese United Press dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Suspicious Behavior of Russian Train Attendants (Harbin) The southern line of the China Eastern Railway, which was always considered absolutely safe, suddenly experienced an unprecedented tragedy, which had a great impact on the South Manchurian transportation. According to the talk of the victims, the Soviet attendants in the first and second class cars turned the light switches on and off from time to time that night, seemingly indicating some kind of signal. When the train was traveling between Wujia and Shuangchengbao, there was a loud noise. At that time, it was thought to be a derailment, but hundreds of Yi army members immediately started shooting, and the army instantly turned into a battlefield. The guards rose up to fight back, exchanging miserable gunfire in the rain and darkness. The purpose of the Yi army was to kidnap Japanese and loot property. Then they shouted and jumped into the first and second class cars, taking all the passengers of the first class car away. Sato Takeo, a professor of medicine at Seoul Imperial University and a doctor of medicine, closed the door and turned off the lights, and fortunately escaped the disaster. Six Japanese and one American were kidnapped, and they were whipped naked. Most of the dead died from trying to break free or being trampled to death. In addition to the Japanese, there were three Manchus and two Russians injured. They only asked the Russian and "Manchurian" people for money and did not harm them. (Electric Communication dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Number of Dead, Injured, and Kidnapped (Changchun) The following is the official report received today on the victims of the accident on the southern line of the Eastern Railway: 7 Japanese and 5 Manchus died, and 22 were seriously and slightly injured. 6 Japanese, 1 American, and 1 Dane were kidnapped. (Electric Communication dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The total number of people who died on the spot and died from serious injuries in this train overturning has reached ten. In addition, in addition to Uchida and Fujisawa, officials of the Resources Bureau, there are also two or three Koreans who were kidnapped. It is now found that the names of those who were kidnapped at that time are listed on the left: Hirata Kanjiro, a water transport officer of the Railway Bureau; Kawabata Tokuji, an official of the Dalian Wharf Office; Murakami Kita, an official of the Harbin Office of the Ministry of Civil Affairs; Mr. Takarazuka, an official of the Mito Company; a Danish tourist, Johnson; Matsumoto Keizo, an official of the Mito Company; and Rulli, a Japanese-American businessman who stayed in Japan's Showa Building in Marunouchi. It is said that those who were kidnapped this time were people who ran away from the sleeper car when the Yi army robbed the train. Passengers who stayed locked in the car were spared. (Japanese United Press dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Troops Dispatched to Pursue (Harbin) This morning, the Yamamoto Cavalry Unit of the Wakayama Unit stationed in Harbin, about 600 people, led by Captain Yamamoto, went to Shuangcheng County. There were also Japanese independent guard troops and puppet infantry troops accompanying them. It is reported that they want to thoroughly attack the Yi army and try to rescue the kidnapped Japanese. (Associated Press dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Regarding the whereabouts of Engineer Fujisawa Takeo of the Japanese Cabinet Resources Bureau and five other Japanese, as well as Johnson, the manager of MGM Pictures, and Rulli, the owner of the Rulli Foreign Company in the Showa Building in Tokyo, who were kidnapped when the Yi army attacked the train on the southern line of the China Eastern Railway, the Wakayama Unit and the Civilian Affairs Department in Harbin started operations at dawn today. It was learned at 2:00 PM today that those who were kidnapped were escorted north to the Zhize area in the middle of the Songhua River in the Xujiawo tribe west of Wujia Station. Therefore, a large-scale operation has begun. Moreover, the Yi army is afraid of the pursuit of the Japanese army and dare not cross the Songhua River. Therefore, the Japanese army is now severely guarding that area and plans to wipe out the Yi army in one fell swoop. (Electric Communication dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Night Trains Between Harbin and Changchun Suspended (Harbin) The China Eastern Railway authorities decided to suspend the night trains that depart from Harbin and Changchun at 9:00 PM, due to the threat of the Wujia Station incident. (Associated Press dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Another Train Attacked East of Ashi River</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The China Eastern Railway train was attacked by "bandits" again today, but they did not use the old trick of dismantling the tracks. This time, a train heading west was stopped by a fog signal 18 miles east of the Ashi River. After the train stopped, the "bandits" opened fire, injuring a Russian driver and a Chinese fireman. Although the driver was injured, he continued to drive the train east to Ertiantangzi (transliteration) and safely arrived there. As for Johnsen and Lulli, two employees of the American MGM film company who were kidnapped from the train 26 miles south of Harbin yesterday, their whereabouts are still unknown.

<h3>Russian Warships Return Polish Visit</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The flagship "Marat" and two minelayers (the "Kalinin" and "Volodarsky") of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, under the command of Commander Galerev, left Kronstadt this morning for the Polish naval port of Gdynia in return for the Polish Navy's visit to the Soviet Union last month.

<h3>Japanese Propaganda Claims Secret German-Polish Pact; Russian Newspaper Exposes Its Intentions</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun's London correspondent reported that "a secret pact exists between Germany and Poland stipulating that if Japan and the Soviet Union initiate hostilities, Germany and Poland will jointly attack the Soviet Union." The Izvestia newspaper commented on this, saying, "This prestigious Japanese newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, is undertaking a task not usually performed by Japanese newspapers, namely, revealing secrets of war preparations. We only need to observe recent news from Japan superficially to understand that these newspapers have received orders from 'certain parties' to daily inform Japanese readers that Japan and 'Manchukuo' have absolutely no aggressive ambitions and are determined not to prepare to attack the Soviet Union. However, they claim that the Soviet Union is trying to attack Japan and Manchukuo, and that if such a conflict breaks out, Japan's military mission will be very simple because Japan will not be isolated and will receive joint military assistance from Britain, Germany, and Poland, or all three of them. However, they do not let their own readers know that the adventurist policies pursued by Japanese aggressors in the past have never caused Japan to encounter such thorough moral isolation in world public opinion as it does today. At the same time, this sensational news from the Asahi Shimbun is also noteworthy in another aspect. In order to make Japanese public opinion believe that there is indeed a secret pact between Germany and Poland regarding the Japan-Soviet war, it also uses the opposition of the German and Polish press to the Eastern Pact among other evidence. This point is particularly noteworthy." (TASS dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Direct Paris-Moscow Telephone Line Opens</h3>
<p>Franco-Russian Relations Growing Closer</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers Exchange Encouraging Words</p>
<p>(Paris) The direct telephone line between Paris and Moscow officially opened this afternoon. First, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs Mallarmé spoke with Soviet People's Commissar of Posts and Telegraphs Rykov. Mallarmé said, "I am extremely happy to conduct a telephone call on the direct telephone line between Paris and Moscow today. Transportation and communication between the two countries will advance from this point on. This is a very good omen for the future of friendship between the two countries. I firmly believe that not only will Franco-Russian relations grow closer as a result, but world peace will also benefit." Rykov replied, "Both France and Russia are striving to maintain peace. I am certain that after the realization of telephone communication, the two countries will become closer in economic and intellectual aspects. On behalf of my country, I extend my respects to you and ask you to convey the respects of the postal and telegraph workers of our country to the workers of your country." Then, Foreign Minister Barthou spoke with Soviet Deputy People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs Krestinsky. Barthou said, "The voice of the French Foreign Minister is reaching Moscow directly from Paris via telephone line for the first time. I sincerely wish that these first few words will clearly state the close and friendly relations between France and Russia and France's full commitment to maintaining peace. The responsibility of maintaining peace is extremely important, and it can only be achieved if countries that share this goal cooperate faithfully, resolutely, and continuously. We are very pleased that Soviet Russia is willing to cooperate with France. I deeply hope that this telephone communication will greatly benefit the development of Franco-Russian friendship in all aspects." Afterward, Barthou exchanged conversations with French Ambassador to Russia Alphand, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to France Hershfeld, and Krestinsky. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>French Newspaper Discusses the International Situation</h3>
<p>(Paris) Le Petit Journal, under the headline "Are We About to See War Again?", studies the possibility of world peace and war. It recently published an article by reporter Berthelot, which stated, "The greatest events in human history are brewing. Ambitions, desires, and the need for survival have reached a climax. Firstly, regarding Britain, the competition between Japan and Russia is sufficient to damage its prestige and its commercial power in the Far East. If a conflict occurs between Japan and Russia, Britain will not suffer any losses. Britain's only policy is to maintain its superior power. The Netherlands is threatened by the economic bankruptcy and the trend of native revolutions. Germany is seeking advancement in the Pacific, and Poland's importance in Asian commerce is beyond what is generally expected. Next is Soviet Russia, which is watched by generally weak and small ethnic groups. That country has formed close relations with the ethnic groups of Central Asia and is also close to Japan. Japan's modern culture and industry are excessively inflated and urgently need to expand outwards. It would be difficult to confine it to the islands. Next, there is the United States. Western civilization in Asia often relies on that country as its protector. Americans want to 'whiten Asia,' thus inviting resistance from Japan, which says, 'Asia belongs to Asians.' Finally, there is China, which has been seeking unification for five thousand years and has aroused the covetousness of foreigners, so that the Pacific problem is no different from the China problem. France controls a part of Southeast Asia through Annam. France's integrity is praised by people, and it has a great mission in the Pacific, but we French people must broaden our horizons and not see the Alps as the national border."

<h3>Korea Cracks Down on the Entry of Chinese Laborers</h3>
<p>Seoul (1st) The Korean Governor-General's Office, in order to adjust the labor situation in Korea and protect the lives of laborers, decided to prohibit the entry of Chinese laborers from September 1st. The regulations are recorded as follows: (1) Those who do not carry a deposit of more than 100 yen will not be allowed to enter the country; (2) Those who do not have definite jobs will not be allowed to enter the country. The Governor-General's Office issued the following opinions on the above situation: Regulations for cracking down on the entry of Chinese laborers have long been established, but the entry of Chinese laborers has never had any impact on the Korean labor market, so it was casually overlooked. However, recently, the number has increased by 3,000 people per year, and the total is estimated to reach more than 40,000 people. Judging from this situation, if their entry into the country is allowed to continue unchecked, it will inevitably oppress the Korean labor market. Therefore, the existing rules will still be applied to crack down on the entry of Chinese laborers. (Rengo dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>The King of Italy Will Make a Foreign Tour</h3>
<p>(Paris) Le Petit Journal published a dispatch from Rome stating that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has no intention of visiting several government authorities abroad in return, but the King of Italy will soon make a foreign tour.

<h3>German Triumvirate Rule</h3>
<p>(Berlin) A plan to divide the German regime and make Göring, Blomberg, and Hess a triumvirate is underway. It will be officially announced at the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg next week. It is learned that General Göring has now found staff to prepare for the position of Deputy Prime Minister. General Blomberg will in fact be the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, but the police maintaining domestic security will still be under the command of General Göring. Hess will still represent Führer Hitler in presiding over the Nazi Party. (Kuo Min Telegraph, 31st)</p>
<h3>Hitler Reduces the Sturmabteilung</h3>
<p>From 200,000 Men to 60,000 Men</p>
<p>A Concrete Expression of Peaceful Intentions</p>
<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler's Sturmabteilung is today carrying out a reduction. The original number of members was 200,000, but now there are less than 60,000 men. The reduction will continue in the future, making it powerless to advise on politics and military affairs. This move is a complete victory for the cabinet faction, which had previously requested the reduction, citing financial reasons first, political reasons next, and finally expressing a peaceful intention towards the tense European situation. In addition, the Röhm faction argued that if the dismissed Brownshirts were not incorporated into the National Defense Force, they would oppose the dismissal, but this point was ultimately not realized. It is said that the important reason for the reduction is the excessive cost, and the right-wingers are deeply afraid that the radical faction of the Sturmabteilung has considerable power, which may be difficult to control and may cause another incident. Some aspects recognize this reduction as concrete evidence of Hitler's usual advocacy of peaceful intentions. (Kuo Min Telegraph, 31st)</p>
<h3>The German Church Dispute</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Archbishop Müller, because the theological professors of Marburg in the province of Hesse-Nassau held a tough attitude towards the church dispute, wielded an iron fist today and listed Professor Hermelink in the list of retirees. He also moved the two courses of comparative religious history and religious philosophy of Marburg University to the University of Greifswald in the province of Pomerania. Therefore, Marburg is no longer a base of orthodox Protestantism. Marburg University will lose its value in the religious life of Germany. According to the university, which was built in 1527, the study of theology is well-known. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3>The Remarks of the President of the German Bank Cause Repercussions in France</h3>
<p>Openly Repudiating Debts Will Close the Doors of Trade</p>
<p>The Market Price of German Public Bonds Plummets</p>
<p>(Paris) The President of the German Reichsbank, Dr. Schacht, said in a speech at the International Agricultural and Scientific Conference on the 30th that all countries should now allow Germany to simultaneously suspend payment of all debts for several years, and reduce Germany's burden to a level that it can bear when the suspension period expires. Then, the major obstacles to the revival of world commerce can be eliminated, and Germany can reappear in the world market as a legitimate buyer. French political circles now say that if payments, including commercial debts, are suspended, then Dr. Schacht will block all sources of credit and close the doors to foreign trade. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) After the speech of the President of the German Central Bank, Dr. Schacht, the market conditions of various German public bonds had a violent reaction, that is, the 7% Dawes Loan of 1924 fell by 3.5 points to 47.5, and the 5.5% Young Loan of 1930 fell by 2.5 points to 36.5.

<h3>International Shipping Competition</h3>
<p>Britain Suggests Convening an International Conference</p>
<p>To Discuss Reducing Subsidies and Lowering Tonnage</p>
<p>The US Government Will Respond After Investigation</p>
<p>(Washington) According to Undersecretary of State Phillips, British Foreign Secretary Simon has proposed to the United States to convene an international conference to discuss reducing merchant shipping subsidies and lowering merchant shipping tonnage in order to avoid competition. Regarding this matter, the United States will first conduct an investigation and then respond to Britain. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters has now learned that the British Chamber of Shipping is currently preparing to hold a conference to deal with the problem of surplus tonnage. This conference may be held in London this autumn and take the form of a special meeting of the International Shipping Conference. The British Chamber of Shipping is currently contacting similar organizations in other countries in order to implement this plan. The British government submitted a memorandum to the governments of various shipping countries on August 16, stating its views on restricting shipping. However, a meeting between governments has not been discussed at present. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Government officials today studied British Foreign Secretary Simon's proposed international conference to reduce shipping subsidies. The State Department has forwarded the matter to a special committee for review. There is no official expression on the US response to Britain. Within the government, opinions are divided on continuing shipping subsidies. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Portugal are the main European countries that insist on subsidizing shipping, but the attitudes of Britain and the United States are relatively moderate. However, the competition that the two countries are currently facing makes it necessary for them to change their shipping policies. President Roosevelt recently declared that the United States intends to develop shipping and is determined not to transfer US shipping rights to foreign countries. Therefore, if the countries fail to conclude an agreement before the end of this year, a shipping war will inevitably occur. British Minister of Commerce Runciman declared that he intends to apply to Congress for £2 million in the autumn to support British ships for one year. (Kuo Min Telegraph, 31st)</p>

<h3>General Strike Order Issued in the US Cotton Textile Industry</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Cotton Textile Workers Strike Committee has issued a general strike order, and the wool industry workers have also decided to join. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(New York) There is no hope of averting the textile workers' strike in the United States. Tomorrow, 425,000 workers will stop working, including the woolen industry. According to Strike Committee Chairman Gorman, although the notice of the woolen industry strike has not yet been issued, it will definitely follow the same steps as the cotton textile workers. The woolen industry workers decided to act in concert with the cotton workers because the woolen industry rules authorities refused to convene a meeting of representatives from both sides. Strike leaders estimate that another 150,000 people will also join the strike. The textile workers in the southern states are preparing to fight to the end, and their leaders are confident that they will be able to force employers to accept their demands for increased wages, limited working hours, non-discrimination against union members, and the right for workers to assemble and negotiate. It is estimated that 150,000 cotton workers in the New England states will strike. The Boston police have discovered that the local Communist Party has received instructions to patrol the strike. The police are closely monitoring the activities of certain people. However, there is still a glimmer of hope in the strike atmosphere in the South, that is, tens of thousands of members of so-called company unions have agreed not to join the strike. The National Labor Relations Board is still working hard to achieve a peaceful resolution as soon as possible and is considering organizing an impartial committee to investigate their dispute impartially.

<h3>Tang Youguang Submits a Report on the Road Conditions in Zhejiang Province After Inspection</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Youguang submitted a report to the Economic Commission on the inspection of the construction of new roads in Zhejiang Province. There are a total of 17 sections of highways under construction, with a total length of more than 1,000 kilometers. Among them, 11 sections have large amounts of stone and large bridge projects. Currently, except for the road sections that have been opened to traffic and the Liqing section, which is time-consuming due to the difficult construction, the rest can be completed in their entirety within the next month. The results are good, but the time limit is pressing, and there are inevitably some shortcomings in line with the usual engineering standards. More than half of the construction has been completed, and it is impossible to fundamentally improve it. However, when repairing bridges in the future, they will be gradually rebuilt as needed to achieve perfection. Now, a list of projects that should be improved on each section before it is formally opened to traffic is submitted for review. The Economic Commission ordered the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction to instruct the Public Works Bureau to investigate. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>After Malaya Restricted the Import of Cotton Textiles</h3>
<p>Japanese Goods Suffer a Severe Blow</p>
<p>Singapore Special Dispatch Since the British Malayan government promulgated the law restricting the import of cotton textiles, the import of cotton textiles from various countries has been greatly affected. Because Japan has implemented a dumping policy in recent years, it has suffered an even more severe blow. According to the report of the local government's Statistics Bureau, from the beginning of this year to May 7, when the law restricting the import of cotton textiles was promulgated, the import of cotton cloth to Malaya totaled 57 million yards. The annual import volume in the previous year was about 100 million yards. Calculated in the past few months, the import of Japanese cotton textiles has exceeded the legally permitted import volume of 6.5 million yards according to the restriction law. The detailed rules of the restriction law stipulate that the excess import volume before the promulgation of the restriction law this year can be deducted from the import volume next year. Now, the excess amount in this country in the past few months has reached the aforementioned 6.5 million yards. The amount of import permission that Japan should have obtained next spring will be equivalent to blocking its import in addition to this deduction. However, this only applies to white cotton cloth. As for dyed textiles and rayon, there is still a little room for maneuvering. In short, Malaya's restriction on the import of cotton textiles has indeed dealt a fatal blow to the import of Japanese cloth. Japanese cotton textile importers here have already fallen into a very miserable situation.</p>

<h3>Conflict of Authority Between Two Japanese Agencies Stationed in the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Caused by Smuggling Cases</p>
<p>The Situation Has Become Serious</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun of August 23rd, at a time when the reform of institutions in Manchuria is being advocated seriously, the sudden conflict of authority between the two major agencies, the Kwantung Government and the Embassy, is a major ominous phenomenon in national politics. After "Manchukuo" took over the Dalian Customs last summer, it raised the tax rate. Therefore, smuggling cases in the Kwantung Leased Territory on the border between Manchuria and Korea have been occurring frequently. The amount of smuggling of cotton cloth, rayon, sugar, woolen fabrics, etc. has gradually increased, and the authorities' crackdown has already become a major issue. Unexpectedly, on July 12th and 13th, a large-scale organized smuggling incident was discovered in a Manchuria Railway freight car between Pulandian and Wafangdian in the Kwantung Leased Territory. The principal offender was a worker in the Wafangdian Manchuria Railway engine district. The offender was arrested by the Wafangdian Kwantung Leased Territory Police Station, which led to the expansion of the case. The Yingkou Military Police Detachment believed that the prosecution by the Wafangdian Police Station was slow and that there were suspicions of malfeasance by a number of police station officers. Starting on August 4th, they conducted a thorough investigation in the Tianjia area of Wafangdian for four days, involving more than 100 people. More than 20 police officers were suspected and escorted to the Yingkou Military Police Team, and then transferred to the consulate. The Yingkou Consul, seeing the abnormality of the incident, in order to avoid the advisor to the Kwantung Government Police Department, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assign the responsibility of interrogation in order to thoroughly investigate whether the police officers had committed any illegal acts. This matter is currently under investigation in Yingkou, and the Kwantung Government authorities believe that the actions of the Yingkou Consul are not only illegal, but also deliberately trampling on the dignity of the Kwantung Government and tarnishing the prestige of the Kwantung Government Police Officers. They are greatly dissatisfied with this act of exceeding authority. On the one hand, it is believed that the conspiracy of this case has a major relationship with Councilor Tani Masayuki. The future changes in the situation deserve close attention.</p>
<h3>The Eastern River in Guangdong Floods, Downstream Disaster Areas Suffer</h3>
<p>Refugees in Shangdong, Dongguan, Urgently Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>Over 500 Houses Collapsed in Pingshan District, Huiyang</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, The big flood in the lower reaches of the East River in Guangdong Province has caused disaster. A breach of more than 200 zhang occurred in Shangdong Village, Dongguan County. The water depth in and out of Huiyang City is more than one zhang, as high as the eaves. The situation of the disaster has been briefly recorded in previous reports. Now, although the flooding is gradually receding, after the heavy flooding, the people in the area are almost destitute. The damage to the destroyed roads cannot be counted. There are about 1,500 refugees in Shangdong Village, Dongguan, still living on the hills, waiting to be fed. The village had a breach once 20 years ago. In recent years, the river management committee loaned funds to repair it, and the funds have not yet been repaid. Now it has suffered this tragic calamity again, and it will not be able to restore its vitality after a hundred years. Yesterday, representatives of the refugees from the village went to the province to appeal to the authorities for relief to save the remaining lives of the thousands of disaster victims. As for Huiyang, the water level was highest on the 24th of this month, with a water depth of more than 1 zhang and 2 chi on flat ground. Fortunately, the weather cleared up and the flooding receded quickly. Traffic has gradually resumed. According to a post-disaster investigation, the Pingshan area of the county is located in the upper reaches of the West River. Mountain floods arrived suddenly and were not easy to discharge. Pingshan Market became a flooded area. More than 100 residents were drowned because they could not escape. 18 houses collapsed in the market, 21 in North Gate Street, 9 in the Lumberyard, 17 in Caotang Street, 12 in Shakangwei, 18 in West Gate, and 23 in Mahuang Temple. In various villages, the number of collapsed houses is: 37 in Qiaotian Township, 21 in Longguizhang, 33 in Hetou, 27 in Waliao, 24 in Duchaotou, 30 in Qinglongtan, 22 in Wenbu, 27 in Buxinwei, 26 in Xiaopu, 34 in Lingzitou, 25 in Dazhou, 26 in Qinghe, and 37 in Huangzhuli. A total of 503 houses collapsed. The roads are full of starved corpses, and the situation is especially tragic. Also, hundreds of houses collapsed in the Baimanghua area. More than 100 people were trapped in the water and fortunately rescued. All crops were lost, and the fields have become wilderness. In the Sanduozhu area, the loss of materials and engineering for the Pingrong Highway exceeded 10,000. One bridge was destroyed in the Pingduo section, and the roadbed was leveled for more than 80 chi. In the Duoxin section, a large bridge 110 chi long was washed away by the water. The water depth on the flat ground was more than 1 zhang, and traffic was cut off. It was an unprecedented disaster in the area. At the moment, mourning cries are everywhere. The county party headquarters and various groups have sent telegrams to the provincial government requesting that funds be allocated quickly for disaster relief to ensure the safety of the people.

<h3>Reports by Kong Hechong at the Memorial Week Ceremony of the Acting Headquarters</h3>
<p>Kong Hechong, the former commander of the Red Bandit's pseudo-Sixth Army Corps, surrendered and attended the Memorial Week ceremony of the Acting Headquarters last month on the 20th. He reported on the overall collapse of the Red Bandits, the gist of which was recorded in this newspaper on the 24th. Now, we further supplement the full text of Kong's report as follows:</p>
<p>"Chairman and Comrades, it is a great honor for Hechong to participate in the Memorial Week of the Premier today. However, upon self-reflection, I feel only shame and apprehension. I am ashamed of having strayed onto the wrong path and made grave mistakes. I am apprehensive because I am but a humble person under your command. Yet, I am grateful to Chairman Chiang for not blaming my past and treating me with exceptional courtesy. This magnanimity makes me feel deeply indebted and without a place to hide myself. As for my background, I am especially grateful for the Chairman's introduction just now. Now that I have the honor of attending this grand meeting, I can only report my past experiences in three parts as follows, as a reference for eliminating bandits and as a contribution to express my gratitude: A. My aspirations for surrendering; B. The actual situation in the bandit areas; C. Personal opinions.</p>
<p>Now, let me first talk about Part A. Since I joined the pseudo-Soviet revolution in 1927, eight years have passed. My original intention for participating was to fight for the interests of the masses, not for personal gain. However, after eight years of trial, the result was the opposite of my original intention. Not only did the political level decline day by day, but the lives of the masses also became more and more painful. They were completely deceived by the Communist Party. This is clear proof that communism is not viable. Therefore, a new feeling arose. Since 1927, I have held considerable positions in the Soviet government, from commander to commander-in-chief. However, after examining the country, society, and people's livelihood, I finally realized that it was a kind of blind obedience, and what I saw was an inhuman life. Because China is not an industrialized country, there is no such thing as a bourgeois or proletariat. The masses are all poor. There is fundamentally nothing to share, but they insist on using a strong hand to carry out the so-called common ownership. Therefore, the result is only getting worse and worse. This is the reason why communism cannot be realized. Furthermore, regarding their strategy, initially they were made to follow the Qiu Bai line by the Third International, which was deemed an opportunistic line. As a result, it was considered rash action. Following this was the Li Lisan line, which soon failed and was unworkable. Then there was the Luo Ming line, the Bolshevik line, and various other lines. Not only did they still fail, but they also caused those who claimed to be leaders to have factional differences and endless internal strife. From this, it is even more evident that China absolutely cannot implement communism. This is an undeniable fact. Only the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People conform to China's national conditions, the modern environment, and can be realized to save China. Therefore, I resolutely made the greatest determination to surrender and return, not for fear of hardship, nor for promotion and wealth, but entirely to seek to save the suffering masses, eliminate the Red Bandits, and realize the Three Principles of the People under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. This is the general meaning and aspiration of my coming here.</p>
<p>Next, I will talk about the second part, the actual situation in the bandit areas. Since the Communist Party implemented the land revolution, they have supposedly adopted the land distribution policy of the Marx and Lenin era. However, at one time, they advocated confiscating the land of landlords with more than 100 mu, and at another time, they advocated confiscating all land and redistributing it. As a result, the masses did not gain any benefit but were first subjected to the levies and corvée labor, which was simply deceiving the suffering masses as tools for the bandits to seize power. Recently, they have also said that the masses are willing to go to the front lines as Red Army soldiers to call on the masses to be sacrificed. In fact, no one is willing to go; they are all forced to go. At the moment, there are no able-bodied men in the bandit areas, and complaints are rampant, which is the reason. Secondly, the pseudo-commander-in-chief has now changed his strategy in military matters. First, he uses the pseudo-First, Third, and Fifth Army Corps as the main force to resist the National Army in the main areas, and uses the pseudo-Seventh and Ninth Army Corps to contain the National Army in the secondary areas. Second, he organizes various guerrilla teams in an attempt to disrupt the rear of the National Army. Third, he assembles the main force, attacks the weak points of the National Army, and seeks opportunities for battle, implementing short and rapid assaults. Fourth, he strengthens the power of the masses. This is the recent strategy of the bandits. Another combat tactic is that each squad is equipped with a skilled marksman to individually shoot at the targets of the National Army. But evil cannot defeat good, which is natural. All kinds of cunning schemes have been defeated by the National Army. As a result, they are only waiting to die. Furthermore, since the National Army implemented the blockade, rice, salt, and so on have been almost cut off. The bandit guerrilla teams cannot move freely. The banknotes issued by the pseudo-central government, which were more than ten million when I left, are not in cash. It costs one yuan to buy one tael of oil and salt. The source of income depends entirely on various taxes. The budget for taxes in the bandit areas can only support three or four months. There are still eight or nine months of expenses, which completely depend on looting the local tyrants. Now that the local tyrants have been looted, the masses are forced to do the so-called "saving campaign." They have already saved more than three sheng of rice twice, eight sheng of rice twice, and five sheng of rice twice. Even vegetables must be saved by the masses to supply them. This kind of coercive measure is partly due to the tight blockade, which prevents oil, salt, and food from entering the bandit areas, and at the same time, the products of the bandit areas cannot be sold. Especially since the fifth encirclement and suppression, the bandit areas have gradually shrunk. The general masses are very dissatisfied with the pseudo-Soviet Communist Party and want to join the National Army. This is a glimpse of the psychology of the masses in the bandit areas. Furthermore, the main force of the bandits cannot overcome the fortress policy. In particular, the soldiers are most afraid of airplanes and cannons. Especially in every war, they are defeated, and their lives are extremely painful. Therefore, the number of people coming to surrender is gradually increasing. This is proof of the strength of the bandit army. Now there are 200,000 people recruited in the rear, including men and women, all of whom are forced to come. Every batch sent to the front line runs away. Now the effective forces are the pseudo-First, Third, Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth Army Corps, a total of twelve divisions and five teaching divisions. Each regiment also has independent battalions, special service companies, guerrilla teams, and so on. The rest of the bandit army is either understaffed or has insufficient firearms and no training, making them vulnerable. The above is all the actual situation in the bandit areas.</p>
<p>Now, let me talk about the third part, my personal opinions on the bandit areas. How to eliminate bandits and how to prevent bandits from ever occurring again? We should refer to the above-mentioned actual situation in the bandit areas to attack the weaknesses of the bandits. In my opinion, the most important thing is to start from the political aspect. First, the issue of organization. The organizational strength of the masses in our country is weak. We should step up the organization of the masses. With the masses, we can use their strength to transform everything. For example, the bandit army totals only more than 100,000 people. Why do we need so many National Army soldiers to fight them? This is because the Red Army uses numbing methods to grasp the masses and use them for their purposes. Second, the issue of training. Once we have the masses and the organization, we still need to strengthen training and education. At present, culture is backward, and the knowledge of the masses is immature. The Communist Party uses this weakness to loot the local tyrants and numb the masses. And the masses, being ignorant, are actually deceived by them. Therefore, we must strictly implement special education. The method should be to use the Three Principles of the People to overcome the Communist Party's deceptive tricks of the land revolution. Only in this way can we make the people believe in the Three Principles of the People, and bandits will never occur in China again. Third, winning over the masses. The issue of the masses is paid attention to by all countries in the world. Even Germany, after its defeat, revived by grasping the masses. At present, there are about 2 million people in the bandit areas. Their talents, military force, economy, transportation, etc. are all inferior to ours. And everything we have exceeds theirs. If we can grasp these 2 million people in our hands, the bandits will be eliminated by themselves. Because bandits completely rely on the masses for survival. If we try to win over the masses, it will definitely be very easy. However, there are a few things to pay attention to. First, our declarations or leaflets should not write the words "bandit area masses." Because the word "bandit" makes the masses afraid to look at them. They don't look at them at all. Second, the text should be simple and easy to understand, so that the masses can easily understand it. And it should not only be in vernacular Chinese, but also include a few more notes to give them a good impression. This is the way to win over the masses. The above are all political aspects. Secondly, in the military aspect, the most important thing now is to attack the weaknesses of the bandits. First, bandits are most afraid of airplanes and cannons. We should prepare more airplanes, bombs, and cannons, and pay special attention to the bandits' fortifications. Second, we must strengthen the blockade line. The blockade is very loose in areas such as Ganzhou Yuanjiangkou. Food enters and exits every day. We should especially strengthen the blockade and not relax it at all. Third, pay attention to the longitudinal and transverse bunkers. We should immediately strengthen the bunker policy and build more longitudinal and transverse bunkers, so that the bandits have no chance to escape in the terrain area. As I speculate, the Communist Party will probably flee to Guizhou and Sichuan in the future. Because Guizhou and Sichuan have dangerous mountains, inconvenient transportation, can live independently, and have backward cultures. The masses are easily anesthetized. If we don't pay attention, it will be difficult to eliminate them. Therefore, strengthening the blockade and the bunker policy, so that not a single bandit can escape, is the most important thing. In short, I have come this time with the greatest determination. In the past, I worked 14 or 16 hours a day. Now I am willing to work a few more hours. My will is that if the bandits are not eliminated in one day, I will not let go in one day. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the soldiers should unify their will and resolutely eliminate the bandits and revive China. This is my personal aspiration."</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Government Implements Joint Office</h3>
<p>All Departments and Offices Vigorously Streamline Personnel and Reduce Government</p>
<p>Monthly Savings of 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The joint office of all departments and offices of the Hubei Provincial Government, after a long period of preparation, will be implemented on September 1st. The implementation measures have been approved by Chairman Chiang. In general, all official documents will be collected and distributed by the Provincial Government and decided on in the name of the Chairman. Subordinate agencies directly under the departments and offices may issue orders directly. Submissions to the Provincial Government will be changed to signed reports. Communication between departments and offices will still be done by official letters. All accumulated cases were completely handled on the 31st. Reorganization was implemented, and the list of staff was also announced on that day. It is found that the Provincial Government originally had three sections, which have now been reduced to two. Four offices have been added: technical, legal, statistical, and public bulletin. Monthly expenses have been reduced from more than 23,000 yuan to more than 17,000 yuan. The Department of Civil Affairs originally had three sections, with the addition of a land section and a opium prohibition office. Now there are still three sections, and the opium prohibition office has also been changed to a section. The first, second, and third subsections of the first section have been merged into one subsection, and the fourth subsection has been abolished. The first subsection of the second section has been merged with the second subsection of the first section. The original expenses of more than 22,600 yuan have been reduced to more than 17,000 yuan. The Department of Finance originally had four sections, which have now been reduced to three. The original expenditure of more than 22,000 yuan has been reduced to more than 16,000 yuan. The Department of Construction originally had four sections, which have been reduced to three. Monthly expenses have been reduced from more than 13,000 yuan to more than 9,900 yuan. However, the Department of Education still has three sections, and the reduction of personnel is also relatively small. In total, the departments have laid off about 100 people, and expenses have been reduced by more than 30,000 yuan. The Security Office originally had staff, adjutants and other offices, with sections under the offices. Now they are all merged and changed to the Director's Office, with three sections under it. Because the candidates for the director and deputy director have not been determined, the reorganization will take some time. As for the criteria for this layoff, inspectors, general affairs and accounting staff are all laid off. Section chiefs, subsection chiefs, and section staff are laid off at discretion. Those with service experience are still transferred to other agencies for appointment, or given external positions at discretion. (August 31)</p>

The attendees were Yan Shenyu, Ye Dezhen, Yu Tanfen, Qian Sunqing, Gui Wochen, Qian Zhongliang, and other 30 people. The chairman was County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, and Qian Sunqing was elected as the vice chairman. After the formalities were completed, the chairman first stated the opinions of the meeting, saying that since the second county administrative meeting in this county, after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the social economy has been extremely panicked. Up to now, looking ahead and looking back, there are many difficulties for the administrative economy of this county, and we urgently need to find ways to provide relief. However, the bad habits of previous meetings were often that many things were discussed but not decided, and decisions were not implemented. It is hoped that this conference should, within the possible scope of human and financial resources, try its best to implement the proposals and find ways to alleviate the current difficulties, and so on. After the chairman finished his statement, guests and members Gui Wochen, Qian Sunqing, Hua Yizhi, Gao Jiansi, and Xue Mingjian successively delivered speeches. Then, the members of the proposal review committees of each group were nominated, and Qian Sunqing was designated to convene the finance group, Gao Jiansi was designated to convene the education group, Chen Zhanru was designated to convene the autonomy group, Cheng Jingtang was designated to convene the public security group, Rong Desheng was designated to convene the construction group, Hu Pinfang was designated to convene the agriculture and forestry group, and Gui Wochen was designated to convene other groups.

In the afternoon, the members of the review committees of each group separately convened review meetings to review the proposals of each group. This morning, the proposals of the finance group and the public security group will be officially discussed. This afternoon, the proposals of the education group and the construction group will be discussed.</p>
<h3>Registration of Opium Addicts Begins</h3>
<p>The Opium Prohibition Committee of this county held its third meeting at the county government at 2 pm yesterday and decided that registration of opium addicts, due to the urgency of the deadline, should begin on September 1. The registration and licensing methods are as follows: in the urban area, register with the county government; in each township, the registration shall be handled nearby by the district offices and the public security bureaus. As for the opium cessation permits, they are divided into two types, A and B, according to regulations. The first fee for a Type A permit is six yuan, and the first fee for a Type B permit is six jiao. Both are replaced once a year, and the permit fee is doubled each time. At the same time, the Civil Hospital was designated as the acting opium cessation center.</p>
<h3>Disputes over the Opening of the National Goods Market</h3>
<p>The Wuxi National Goods Exhibition, organized by the Shanghai China National Goods Promotion Society, came to Wuxi to set up a market to sell goods at the original site of the National Goods Market. It was originally scheduled to open on September 1. Before the event, more than ten trade associations, such as silk, cloth, foreign goods, cotton textiles, etc., in Wuxi, in view of the fact that previous national goods exhibitions in Wuxi had caused repeated disputes at the end, and even used low-quality goods to impersonate national goods to deceive customers, were still afraid of repeating the previous mistakes, so they went to the Chamber of Commerce to question them. The Chamber of Commerce did not have anyone to contact them beforehand, and also because similar national goods markets in Nantong and Yangzhou had caused great disputes. According to the letter from the county to inquire and also advocate that the exhibition principle should not be violated, and it should not be exclusively set up as a business, during this time of market depression, it is not appropriate to speculate on dumping and absorb domestic cash. The county government approved the letter and immediately notified the business that it should not set up a market to sell goods before negotiating properly with the various industries. Therefore, the market is now only exhibiting to all sectors and not doing business. On the one hand, the representatives Shen Mengshi and Gu Jianchen, the executive director of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, explained to all parties.</p>

<h3>The Wind of Robbery is Rampant in the Four Townships</h3>
<p>Since the eight summers, there has been a long drought and no rain, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. People are panicked. A group of unemployed vagrants form gangs and take the opportunity to be active in the various townships. Therefore, robbery cases have occurred frequently recently, and people cannot sleep peacefully. In front of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in the county and city a daytime robbery case actually occurred, which is truly shocking. If the authorities do not take urgent measures to prevent and control it, the local security will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<h3>Bandits Active in the Eastern Township</h3>
<p>Bandits are actively operating in the various districts of the eastern township of Tongyi. The Nantong District Security Command has specially transferred a security team to suppress them. The team is currently conducting a large-scale search and suppression in the Yudong area. Ten bandit criminals, including Zhuang Yunhai, were arrested and sent to the county government for interrogation on the 31st.</p>
<h3>Young Arch-Thief Re-Tried and Exempted from Death</h3>
<p>The arch-thief Qin Jinchang rampaged in the Siyu area, robbing and killing people. He was captured by the police and militia and sentenced to death by the court. Later, the High Court sent him back for a retrial on the grounds that the bandit was not yet sixteen years old. The criminal court has now changed the sentence to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Lianshui</p>
<h3>The Militia Team Suffers a Crushing Defeat in Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>Zhu Zongwen, the district chief of the second district of this county, selected young militiamen from this district and the Liangcha Town area to form a militia team of more than 50 people to suppress bandits when encountering bandit police, because the Guzhai was lost and the loss was unhelpful. On the afternoon of the 26th, Zhu heard that the Huai'an-Lianshui two-county guard teams were suppressing bandits in Sunjiazhuang, so he went to help suppress them. Due to the darkness of the sky and the fact that the officers and soldiers had not been informed in advance, they were attacked by the bandits Zhang Zhigao and others in a trench north of Sunzhuang. When the officers and soldiers arrived, the bandits fled. As a result, 19 militiamen were killed and two were injured. Four male and female hostages were intercepted.</p>

<h3>Hungry People in the Four Townships Rob Rice</h3>
<p>The Hantang area south of this county is inherently barren, and this year's drought has exhausted the farmers' food supply. Local ruffians such as Wang Xiaodi incited poor farmers to rob rice in nearby townships. For a time, more than 100 people gathered, blew bamboo tubes as a signal, and robbed from house to house. The robbed families, feeling sorry for the hunger of the people, did not report to the officials to investigate. In addition, in the Qianbang, Gejiawan, and Pengjiawei areas south of Dayun Temple, dozens of hungry people form groups every day, holding tools and breaking into people's homes, robbing rice when they see it. The township chief flew to report to the Zhongdai Town Guard Group and sent a team to suppress it. The hungry people dispersed when they heard the news.</p>

<h3>Yulin Bus Accident on the Mountain</h3>
<p>The Yulin Road Company bus, carrying passengers at 5 pm on the 31st, suddenly encountered a bus of the Yuhang Public Security Bureau police while passing the mountain road of Xiaobaiyang Mountain in Yuhang. The bus, which was carrying more than 20 policemen, suddenly fell from the mountain into the fields more than three zhang below. Fortunately, the cylinder did not explode, but all the policemen were injured. Chen Ziyun and Wang Bing were the most seriously injured and were hired to be sent to the Hangzhou Municipal Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Farmers in Cixi Plead for Famine Relief</h3>
<p>Farmers in the various townships of Cixi have been gathering in the city for days to petition the county government for famine relief. On the morning of yesterday (30th) at 11 am, more than 1,000 farmers from Xiangao and Mingshan townships, and Ye Ruichang and other farmer representatives from Jinchuan township, entered the city in a big way to petition the county government. Qian Zushou, the chief of the first section of the county government, received them. The farmers demanded four points: (1) There is money in the countryside but nowhere to buy rice. Please order the rice merchants to quickly identify the rice to help. The county government replied that it would order the public security bureau to urge the rice merchants to handle it quickly. (2) Submit to the provincial government to allocate money for disaster relief. The answer has been forwarded. (3) Survey the disaster and exempt the rent. The answer is that it should be handled accordingly. (4) It is forbidden to pre-rent farmland. It is forbidden by law. However, if the rent has been collected last year, should it be claimed back from the owner if the crops have not been harvested this year? Wait for the provincial government to instruct. The farmers were satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Bandits Resist Arrest and Shoot Farmers</h3>
<p>In the Hujia area of Qianyandang Temple, Dongyan Township, Er District, Zhenhai, there is a person named Jin Wenzhang who raises ducks for a living. The night before, he took three or five hired workers and released ducks on the Majiaqiao River in the township. He saw four people coming from the Tuanchiao side and returning to the township's Banqiao, going back and forth four times. Wenzhang became suspicious and knew they were not good people. Before long, he saw one of them wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, wearing white ash sneakers, and holding a flashlight, wandering around nearby. Wenzhang immediately shouted that there were thieves, and took the hired workers to twist him. At that time, the local farmers Sun Anxin and Chen A'wu heard the sound and came out to see. The four people were indeed bandits. The other three saw that a thief was arrested, and they took out their pistols and shot at the farmers. A bullet hit Sun Anxin's right waist, a vital part, and he fell to the ground and died immediately. Chen A'wu was also hit in the right shoulder and escaped with his wound. The farmers also fled when they saw this. The captured bandit was still taken back and escaped along the original road. Afterwards, the responsible public security bureau reported to the Zhenhai County Government for inspection and to arrest the murderer and investigate the matter.</p>

<h3>Yang Hucheng's Reception of the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing the Stability of Shaanxi and the Gradual Recovery of Rural Areas</p>
<p>Troop Reduction in Progress, Focusing on Afforestation and Road Construction</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Yang Hucheng, the Pacification Commissioner of Shaanxi, has been very busy entertaining various circles since arriving in Shanghai from Xunyang on the 29th of last month. Yang Hu, the director of the Shanghai Security Office, along with Du Yuesheng, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, and others, hosted a banquet at the Cathay Hotel at 12:30 PM yesterday. Yang Hucheng also met with reporters from various newspapers at the Cangzhou Hotel at noon, releasing a written statement as follows:</p>
<p>(Purpose of Coming to Shanghai) I was summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go to Jiangxi to receive instructions and to report to Chairman Chiang on the pacification of Shaanxi and the recent situation of my headquarters. Therefore, I left Shaanxi on the 13th of this month and met with Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang and Director He Chengjun in Hanzhong. On the 17th, I arrived in Guling and met with Chairman Chiang several times, and was ordered to give a speech to the officer corps. I arrived here by plane on the 29th of last month, intending to meet with Song Ziwen, the chairman of the National Economic Council, for the second time to discuss matters related to the construction in Shaanxi by the NEC and the banking sector, as well as to treat my dental illness. After these matters are completed, I will go to Nanjing to meet with President Wang Jingwei before returning to Shaanxi.</p>
<p>(Stability of Shaanxi) Since 1927, Shaanxi Province has suffered from military and political turmoil, coupled with continuous droughts, leading to the proliferation of bandits and widespread poverty. Since my army was ordered to enter Shaanxi in 1930, we have believed that political clarity requires social stability. Therefore, we actively focused on suppressing bandits, and after a year, we largely eliminated them. In the past two years, due to timely rainfall, the disasters have gradually decreased. In addition, the people are eager for peace, so the bandit suppression has been even more successful. Various bandit leaders have been captured and brought to justice one after another, and the territory is very stable. As for the bandit Xu Xiangqian, who occupied northern Sichuan, he was rampant for a while, but after repeated encirclement and suppression by the Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu armies in the Chengkou and Wanyuan area, I don't know what the recent situation is since I left the province 20 days ago. The defense of southern Shaanxi is firmly secured by the 38th Army of my headquarters, under the command of Sun Weiru. Although there were small-scale intrusions into the border area some time ago, they were immediately repelled by the garrison. The reports in the foreign press a month ago that Zhenba in southern Shaanxi had fallen are completely untrue.</p>
<p>(Troop Reduction) To permanently eliminate banditry and reduce the burden on the people, we must implement production and construction, and reduce the size of the army. Therefore, after my army cleared the various bandit gangs, we immediately followed the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to reduce the size of the troops and implement the soldier-worker system. Since receiving the order last year, we have reduced the size in stages. Since March of last year, we have reduced the size three times, cutting a total of more than 20 regiments and more than 20,000 officers and soldiers, saving approximately 4 million yuan in military expenses annually. The remaining troops have now been reduced in size and are undergoing rigorous training.</p>
<p>(Afforestation and Road Construction) Shaanxi Province is located on a plateau and often suffers from drought. Therefore, we first implemented soldier-worker afforestation. Due to the limited number of saplings, this spring my headquarters only planted more than 160,000 trees. We have now discussed with the provincial government and tentatively designated 200,000 mu of official wasteland on both sides of the Wei River as an area for soldier-worker afforestation, planning to plant 5 million trees. With 20,000 people planting 50 trees each per year, we can complete 5 million trees in five years. In ten years, the trees will be forested, and each tree is valued at two yuan, for a total of over 10 million yuan. We also promote the atmosphere of civilian afforestation in order to make it universal. In addition to planning to divert the Luo River to benefit the fields with a part of the military force, we are also actively building highways. There are four main lines: the Xi'an-Lanzhou, Hanzhong-Baihe, Xianyang-Yulin, and Xi'an-Hanzhong highways, totaling 1,897 kilometers. There are six branch lines, totaling 1,136 kilometers, for a total of 3,033 kilometers. Except for the stone engineering and bridge culverts, which are contracted by the NEC, all the remaining earthwork is undertaken by my headquarters. Currently, 913 kilometers of main and branch line earthwork have been completed, and the rest is still under construction. In addition, in order to practice excavation skills, we specially select one officer from each company to organize a soldier-worker road construction practice team to practice on-site with the stone and earthwork staff of the NEC to prepare for the stone engineering after the earthwork is completed. In addition, we have agreed with the provincial government to organize the Huanglong Mountain Reclamation Bureau. We have now dispatched a regiment of soldiers to first eliminate the bandits in the mountains, then station troops, and finally civilian settlements.</p>
<p>(Promoting the New Life Movement) Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek launched the New Life Movement, it has swept the country in a few months. The New Life Movement is a national salvation movement. In addition to issuing the New Life Movement Guidelines and New Life Movement Outlines promulgated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to all officers and soldiers, ordering them to strictly comply, we also organized a New Life Movement Inspection Team to inspect once a week to promote implementation.</p>
<p>(Rural Recovery) As for the social situation in Shaanxi in recent years, after years of disasters, the local vitality has been greatly depleted. However, in the past two years, the weather has been favorable, the countryside has gradually recovered, and the people's lives have gradually become stable. The central government pays attention to the construction of the Northwest and has specially set up an office of the NEC in Xi'an. Chairman Song Ziwen has worked tirelessly and even personally went to Shaanxi this spring to inspect and guide, assisting the local government in building roads and developing water conservancy. Bankers and industrialists in Shanghai have also come to Shaanxi to set up branches, preparing to invest and lend money to the countryside, which has greatly benefited the people. Especially since Chairman Shao Lizi took office, he has worked hard and achieved remarkable results. However, all production and construction must be based on social stability, and the Communist bandits must be eliminated as soon as possible. In this regard, my army, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, vows to take full responsibility for suppressing them in order to lay the foundation for the construction of the Northwest.</p>
<p>(Bandits Will Be Eliminated) During this trip to Jiangxi, I was ordered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to inspect the Nancheng area and meet with Commander Gu Zhutong. The Jiangxi bandits are at the end of their rope. According to my inspection, they can definitely be eliminated before the Fifth Plenary Session. In recent decades, our nation has been declining day by day. During my trip to Jiangxi, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, even in the hot summer, worked tirelessly for the public good. This spirit of perseverance and dedication to the country and the people is a model for the people of the country. The people of the country should deeply reflect on this and quickly emulate it, so that the revival of the nation can be hoped for.</p>
<p>(Going to Nanjing in a Week) In addition to releasing a written statement, Yang Hucheng also answered questions from reporters, saying that he came here to seek medical treatment for his dental illness. After several treatments by dentist Xu Zifeng, it has gradually recovered, but it has not fully recovered, so he still needs to stay in Shanghai for a week before going to Nanjing to visit President Wang Jingwei and then returning north. Since arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he has met with Song Ziwen and others to further discuss matters related to the construction of the Northwest by the NEC and the investment of the Shanghai banking sector in the Northwest, but no final decision has been made. Shaanxi's revenue and expenditure can now be balanced.</p>
<p>Tang Youren Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<h3>Tang's Remarks</h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Stomach Illness Has Fully Recovered, and His Spirit Is Very Good</p>
<p>Huang Fu Will Come Down the Mountain in Three Days to Return to Shanghai and Then Go North</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Tang Youren, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, went to Jiangxi a few days ago to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He completed his official duties the day before yesterday and took a night train to Shanghai that evening, arriving at the North Station at 7:30 yesterday morning. He went directly to his private residence on Ganshi East Road to rest. Then, at around 10 AM, he met with Zhou Yu, the secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and decided to return to Nanjing in a day or two. According to Tang Youren, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's previous stomach illness has now fully recovered, and his spirit is very good. Huang Fu, the chairman of the Political Affairs Readjustment Committee of the Executive Yuan stationed in Beiping, is scheduled to come down the mountain in three days, go to Nanjing, then come to Shanghai to prepare his luggage, and then return to the north to preside over political affairs in North China.

It has not yet been decided when the two envoys, Yan Huiqing and Gu Weijun, will return to their posts.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Temporary Alert Was Extremely Strict, but It Was Peaceful by Night</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Second National Convention of the Communist Party held in Chicago, USA. The local authorities in the Chinese Concession of this city were deeply afraid that reactionary elements would take the opportunity to cause trouble and disrupt public order. Therefore, they specially announced a one-day temporary alert. In various districts of the Chinese Concession, the police stations under the Public Security Bureau dispatched more police officers to stand guard and organized temporary patrol teams to patrol back and forth. A large number of officers from the Inspection Department and the Detective Team were dispatched to lead plainclothes inspections at the border between the Chinese Concession and the foreign concessions to check suspicious pedestrians. The patrol team of the Second Regiment of the Military Police also patrolled in the city and the suburbs. The Caojiadu area in western Shanghai, due to its concentration of factories, was under even stricter alert. The Public Security Department of the Public Concession also dispatched more detectives to investigate in various public entertainment venues to prevent reactionaries from distributing leaflets. Fortunately, no incidents occurred by night. The temporary alert was lifted this morning.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Sends a Telegram Requesting the Abolition of Sichuan's Oppressive Taxes</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent a telegram to the authorities in Nanjing and Sichuan yesterday, stating: "To the National Government of Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and Liu Xiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan Province in Chengdu: The Chengdu Chamber of Commerce recently sent a telegram stating that the people of Sichuan are suffering under oppressive governance and are eagerly awaiting relief. Fortunately, the central government has issued a clear order to abolish oppressive taxes, effective July 1 of this year, to eliminate taxes that harm the public interest of society, impede the source of central government revenue, hinder transportation, and double taxes and transit taxes, as well as all unequal taxes. The central government has learned from the history of success and failure of our country and adopted the essence of wealth and strength from the world to formulate this great policy program that benefits the country and the people. The general populace, young and old alike, are grateful and tearful, celebrating their rebirth. The hundreds of industry and commerce guilds and store members of our association are particularly supportive and grateful. However, we have seen reports that various provinces in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have submitted reports to abolish hundreds of oppressive taxes and levies. We have yet to see or hear how the Sichuan government will comply, and the farmers, merchants, and workers are already largely displayed in a fish market. We believe that the central government, at the beginning of national construction and national revival, will not allow any provincial executive to delay or feign compliance, obstructing the progress of the major policy. Moreover, the number of oppressive taxes in Sichuan is the highest in the country, and the burden on farmers and merchants is also the highest in the country. The executives have become accustomed to being wrong and find it difficult to change. We earnestly request that the central government promptly select and dispatch senior financial officials to be stationed in Sichuan to supervise the reduction, and allow people's organizations to organize a Supervisory Finance Committee to cooperate in implementing the order. Local executives are not allowed to participate in opinions or interfere and obstruct. All necessary military expenses, political expenses, judicial education construction, security, and relief expenses must be based on income, not exceeding it, and taking into account the current affordability of the people of Sichuan, separately determine the amount to be collected annually under the land tax, the amount to be collected annually under the salt tax, the amount to be collected annually under the customs duties, and the amount to be collected annually under the miscellaneous donations. After the supervising officials and the Supervisory Committee jointly decide, submit it to the central government for record, and strictly prohibit local executives from freely changing or adding to it under any pretext, so that the central government's major policy can be effectively implemented, and the people in the border areas can enjoy the grace of recuperation. People's livelihood and rights will have hope. We humbly believe that abolishing oppressive taxes and levies is the only way for the people of Sichuan to escape death and achieve life. We still hope to unanimously advocate and jointly request that the central government's grace be effectively extended to the people of Sichuan and that the suffering of the people of Sichuan can be relieved as soon as possible. We are extremely grateful and pray that the abolition of oppressive taxes and levies is the only way for the people of Sichuan to escape death and achieve life. We still hope to unanimously advocate and jointly request that the central government's grace be effectively extended to the people of Sichuan and that the suffering of the people of Sichuan can be relieved as soon as possible. We are extremely grateful and pray. The Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, Lin Kanghou, kowtows with seal." It is hereby approved that the people of Sichuan have suffered from oppressive taxes and levies for a long time. Fortunately, our government cares about the people's suffering and has issued a clear order to abolish oppressive taxes and levies. Now, various provinces have successively implemented it, but Sichuan, where oppressive taxes are particularly heavy, is still unheard of. It should be urged to realize it. According to the previous telegram, it is appropriate to send a telegram to your government, departments, and seats for review and verification, requesting approval as requested, and abolishing the oppressive taxes and levies in Sichuan as soon as possible to relieve the suffering of the people of Sichuan. It is extremely urgent. The Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, Lin Kanghou, kowtows with seal.</p>
<h3>Record of Contemporary People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>He Yaozu and Zeng Zhongming took the night express train out of Nanjing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>All American Wheat Loans Have Been Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>322,198 Tons</p>
<p>A Total of 43 Sea Vessels Were Loaded to Shanghai</p>
<p>250,000 Tons of Flour are Also Being Loaded</p>
<p>Since the start of shipping our purchased American wheat on credit on November 18 of last year, the original agreement was for US$6 million to purchase 322,198 tons of wheat, to be fully shipped by the end of June this year. Another 250,000 tons of flour, worth US$4 million, must also be shipped at the same time. When the American wheat was shipped to Shanghai, the market price of flour was only 1.9 yuan per bag, which was extremely uneconomical. Therefore, the American wheat was shipped first and sold to various flour mills in Shanghai at an average price of 4 to 4.2 yuan per bag, which is equivalent to 70 yuan in national currency per ton. Among the ships used for shipping, 23 were chartered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and 20 were chartered by the American Na-Deng-Lie-Lin, for a total of 43 ships. If the United States had not experienced a strike, all of this American wheat would have been shipped to Shanghai long ago. There are still three ships, about 27,000 tons, that have been delayed and are now arriving one after another. Yesterday, the Victoria City vessel entered the port, carrying 8,500 tons of wheat, which is the 42nd ship, currently docked at the No. 12 and 13 wharf for unloading. There is also one last ship, carrying 8,700 tons of American wheat, which, according to a telegram received yesterday, is also en route and will arrive next Saturday. When this batch arrives in Shanghai, all 322,198 tons of American wheat will be completely shipped to Shanghai. From the arrival of the first batch on November 18 of last year to the completion of the shipment, it will take a total of 9 months and 20 days. All the wheat that has been shipped has been sold out, with 95% delivered in Shanghai. The sold wheat price is approximately 22.55 million yuan in national currency. There are also 250,000 tons of flour, and we have now received confirmation that, because the market price of flour in Shanghai has soared to 2.67 yuan, the American side is purchasing it. The Cotton and Wheat Management Office is currently dispatching ships to transport it. According to the reporter's investigation, this loan of flour will be shipped to China, with some unloaded in Shanghai and the rest directly shipped to Tianjin to be sold in North China, which can avoid future transportation costs. North China's flour sales are very smooth, and domestic flour is not enough to meet demand. Therefore, this large batch of American flour will be supplied to the people. At the current market price, 250,000 tons are worth approximately 14 million yuan in national currency, which, combined with the wheat price that has already been sold, totals approximately 37 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Rainfall in Various Regions, Wuxi Rice Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Down 1.2 Yuan Compared to Last Week</p>
<p>Shanghai Social Bureau Prohibits Exceeding the Price Limit</p>
<p>In recent days, intermittent rain has fallen in the city, and the crops along the railway lines have been slightly moistened, which has gradually stabilized people's minds. There has also been 3-5 inches of rain in the interior. The city's rice price is close to the limit set by the last Food Commission, but most still sell for 13.6-13.7 yuan. The Social Bureau, in order to maintain the government's prestige, has decided to issue a notice in the coming days, uniformly limiting the selling price and prohibiting it from exceeding 13.5 yuan. According to the Wuxi telephone yesterday morning, the price of rice in the interior is currently 10.04 yuan for high-quality polished rice, down 1.2 yuan from a week ago, and 5.3 yuan for Japonica rice, down 7 jiao. The situation is similar in Changshu and Suzhou. Zhejiang Province has temporarily stopped purchasing Shanghai rice because it has rained. Rice sales have not been strong recently.</p>
<h3>Agricultural and Commercial Bank Issued Banknotes Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Wang Delin Sends Representatives to Shanghai to Report on the Bitter Struggle in Eastern Jilin</h3>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War on September 18, Wang Delin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Volunteer Army, has repeatedly defeated the enemy. Yesterday, he specially sent a representative through a secret route to Shanghai to report on the recent anti-Japanese situation of his army. A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Shitouhezi On June 16, a bloody battle was fought with a large Japanese army at Shitouhezi in the boundary of Mishan County. After holding out for a day and a night, the Japanese army was defeated. In this battle, more than 70 Japanese soldiers were killed, a Japanese battalion commander, Sugiki, was captured alive, and countless spoils of war were seized. Our army suffered only 13 casualties. The Japanese side is now planning to offer 200,000 yuan in counterfeit currency to the Volunteer Army to redeem the captured battalion commander Sugiki, but our army has not moved.</p>
<p>DaguoKui On July 12, a fierce battle was fought with a Japanese transport team of 500 men at DaguoKui in Wangjia Shaoguo in the boundary of Mishan County. After holding out for six hours, the Japanese army was unable to withstand it and retreated in disarray. In this battle, 30 Japanese soldiers were killed, 30 rifles, 5 trucks, 28 horse-drawn carriages, and a large amount of grain, fodder, and ammunition were seized. Our army suffered only 7 casualties.</p>
<p>Banjiehe On July 30, a close battle was fought with 800 Japanese soldiers guarding the barracks at Banjiehe in the boundary of Mishan County. After four hours of hand-to-hand combat, the Japanese army retreated. In this battle, more than 40 Japanese soldiers were killed, 2 machine guns, 25 steel helmets, and 32 wooden-cased rifles were seized. Our army suffered only 9 casualties.</p>
<h3>The Railway Department Sends Representatives to Survey the Location for Building Warehouses</h3>
<p>Various Railways such as Jinghu, Huhangyong, and Jinpu</p>
<p>Submitting Building Drawings to the Ministry for Review</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that various railways are responsible for transportation and urgently need warehouses. Because merchants expect good prices for their goods, they sincerely hope that the goods can be stored in the warehouse for a long time. The Ministry of Railways, in view of this, has ordered various railways to submit building plans and drawings to the Ministry for review. It is learned that the Jinghu, Huhangyong, Jinpu, and other railways have successively drawn up designs and submitted them for review. Since the construction of warehouses is still a new initiative, in order to ensure its proper and perfect completion, the Ministry has specially dispatched Tan Yaozong, the assistant to the director of the Business Department, and Liu Chuanshu, the secretary of the Joint Transportation Department, to go to the Jinpu Railway to conduct an on-site survey of the location proposed by the railway for the warehouse construction plan to determine whether it is appropriate. It is also heard that after the survey is completed, they will continue to go to the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways to conduct on-site surveys.</p>

<h3>The Post Office Starts Registering Books for Purchase Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Date for Implementing Purchases on Behalf</p>
<p>Still Awaiting Determination and Announcement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice yesterday, stating: "According to the Ministry of Communications Postal Administration General Order No. 1382, forwarded by the Ministry of Communications Order, in order to promote culture, a method for post offices to purchase books on behalf is established. Attached are the Regulations for Post Offices to Purchase Books on Behalf, the Rules for Application for Registration of Post Offices to Purchase Books on Behalf, and the Compilation Format for Book Purchase Catalogues, all in one copy. Registration will begin on September 1. Anyone who meets the qualifications stipulated in the Rules for Application for Registration of Post Offices to Purchase Books on Behalf and entrusts the post office to handle it in accordance with the Regulations for Post Offices to Purchase Books on Behalf may apply to this Administration for registration in accordance with the registration rules. The registration fee is one yuan per book. However, for books published before October of this year and registered with this Administration before October 31, only a registration fee of one jiao will be charged per book to show encouragement. The registered books will be included in the catalogue by the Postal Administration General Office in accordance with the Compilation Format for Book Purchase Catalogues. In order to ensure rapid and accurate compilation, the publisher should, in the application for registration, in accordance with the classification method of books stipulated in Article 1 of the Compilation Format for Book Purchase Catalogues, indicate which of the 19 categories the book applying for registration belongs to, so that it can be catalogued by category. If it is not indicated, the post office will only rely on the book name listed on the application for registration, or may need to review the original book or send inquiries back and forth due to the inability to accurately classify it, which will inevitably cause delays. It is hoped that the publishers will pay attention. As for the handling fee for post offices to purchase books on behalf, although it has been temporarily set at 25% of the actual price for textbooks and 20% for other books, if publishers in various places are willing to negotiate better terms in order to have the post office sell their books as much as possible in various places, they must clearly state the most favorable terms in the application for registration so that the post offices in various places can be informed accordingly. Please do not wait and see and delay yourself. As for the date of implementation of purchases on behalf, it will be determined and announced separately after the catalogue is completed. All regulations can be obtained from the local post office. This is a notice from the Acting Postal Chief Zha Peilin (on official business), Acting District Deputy Postal Chief Wang Weisheng."</p>

<h3>Nanyang Overseas Chinese Lin Aimin and Others Pioneer Overseas Markets for National Products</h3>
<p>Organizing the Xinghua National Products General Branch to Provide Widespread Supply</p>
<p>Entrusting the China National Products Production and Sales Company to Solicit Samples</p>
<p>Among the places where our country's national products are sold abroad, the Nanyang Islands have always been the most prosperous. There are more than six million overseas Chinese who have pioneered and operated in that area. They have always worked hard to use and promote national products. However, since the rise of the European War, the Japanese have taken the opportunity to rise up and have spared no effort in pursuing Nanyang trade. Overseas Chinese in our country, due to the lack of support from the domestic production community, have found it difficult to compete alone. Therefore, up to now, the Japanese have become the number one exporter to Nanyang among all countries, while our country, which has always regarded Nanyang as its only export market, has retreated behind others and suffered a setback. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, aware of this, was deeply worried and has ordered the International Trade Bureau to carefully formulate measures to seek development. Now, overseas Chinese Lin Aimin and others have initiated the organization of the Xinghua National Products Company and entrusted the China National Products Production and Sales United Company in this city to collect samples and will send personnel to Shanghai to discuss everything. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Organizing the Company) Currently, many wealthy overseas Chinese merchants in Singapore, Nanyang, believe that the decline of our country's Nanyang trade and the Japanese squeeze are a major relationship, and that the important reason is that production and sales are lacking joint efforts. Because Nanyang does not have a specific organization to promote national products, domestic factories have many concerns and hesitate to move forward. Overseas Chinese in Nanyang also find it difficult to unify promotion steps due to the decline of national products exported to the south. With scattered individual trade, whether in main force or work, it is not enough to compete with the planned trade of the Japanese. Now, in order to promote the sales of Chinese national products and develop the Nanyang market, they have specially raised funds to establish the Xinghua National Products Company, first establishing the general company in Singapore, and planning to establish branches in various islands of Nanyang, in order to achieve widespread supply. The general company has now been organized and has entrusted the China National Products Production and Sales United Company at 261 Nanjing Road, Shanxi Road, to purchase samples on its behalf.</p>
<p>(Joint Production and Sales) The letter roughly stated, "There are a large number of overseas Chinese from our country, with more than six million in the Nanyang area alone. Most of them are concerned about their homeland and are happy to use national products. If there are excellent national products that meet the demand and promotion is effective, the future hope is unlimited. However, in recent years, the dumping of Japanese goods has been extremely fierce, and all our national products have been hit. In the future, overseas merchants must sincerely cooperate with domestic manufacturers to unite their strengths. It will be difficult to make progress, and I am afraid that the original sales market will decline day by day, and the rights and interests will overflow, which is painful. The colleagues have seen this, and organized the Xinghua National Products Company, which is mainly engaged in the promotion of national products. Now a general company has been established in Singapore, and in the future, it is planned to expand branches in various parts of Nanyang. The general company is now ready and will open soon. We have always admired your company as the general group of national products and hope that you will give us more preferential treatment than usual to overseas national products merchants. In order to seek various samples of goods, please inform us in detail of the prices and preferential measures, and the general agency regulations, so that we can purchase them." (Omitted below)</p>
<p>(Purchasing Samples) After receiving the above letter, the China National Products Production and Sales United Company, in order to promote the sales of Chinese national products and develop foreign trade, in addition to publishing a notice to all national product factories, from September 1st to October 31st, to send personnel to bring the same samples and wholesale prices, agency regulations, etc., to come to negotiate, and also sent letters to various national product factories to seek cooperation (the letter is omitted).</p>
<p>(Dispatching Personnel to Shanghai) After the Xinghua Company entrusted the China National Products Production and Sales Company to collect samples and solicit cooperation from various factories, for the convenience of purchasing national products, Cui Jun was specially sent to Shanghai to review various national products suitable for sale in Nanyang so that they can be transported to Singapore for layout in the short term. The China National Products Production and Sales Company has prepared everything, and it is known that since the company announced the notice, various national product factories in this city have been very enthusiastic in coming to negotiate. Also, the company moved from 500 Ningbo Road, Henan Road, to 261 Nanjing Road, Xilu Road. Later, because there were many people coming to negotiate, for the convenience of handling affairs, the old address on Henan Road is still working as usual.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Unable to Raise Large Sums for Dredging Wusong River</h3>
<p>Fear of another de facto standstill</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Regarding the dredging of the Wusong River, the central government has repeatedly convened relevant parties to discuss solutions. The Municipal Government has sent Tan Wenqing, the second section chief of the Public Works Bureau, to attend. At that time, it was decided that the city would be responsible for raising 200,000 yuan. It was originally planned that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce would raise 100,000 yuan, the Shipping Association and the Inland River Shipping Association would raise 50,000 yuan, and the Municipal Government would allocate 50,000 yuan. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Government sent a letter to the Municipal Government the other day to present the fundraising situation to the central government. However, according to the news obtained by the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is unable to raise 100,000 yuan because it borrowed funds for dredging the Wusong River on behalf of the association in 1924, which has not yet been repaid. The Inland River Shipping Association and others, regarding raising 50,000 yuan, convened a meeting and, after discussion, also stated that they were unable to bear it. At a time when the city treasury is stretched, the Municipal Government cannot independently allocate this huge sum. Therefore, this case will come to a de facto standstill.</p>
<h3>Seafarer Qualification Timeliness Issue Shipping Opportunity Submits for Explanation</h3>
<p>The Seafarer Examination Committee organized by the Ministry of Communications has conducted four seafarer examinations. The Examination Committee of the Examination Yuan previously raised questions about whether it was an examination. The Ministry explained in a letter that the qualification was for on-the-job seafarers to be screened. On July 1, the Seafarer Examination Committee was automatically canceled, and the remaining certificate issuance matters were assigned to the Navigation Affairs Department for handling and changed to on-demand examinations. A marine engineer named Wang Qingfeng wanted to exchange his certificate because his service qualifications met the requirements for exemption from the exam, but the Ministry misunderstood the regulations. The United Marine Engineers Association specifically presented a rebuttal. The original text states, "It is presented because the approved reply is unclear and there are doubts. The reasons are specifically stated, hoping that you will review and follow the instructions. Regarding the application of the seafarer to exchange the Class A Marine Engineer Certificate, the China United Marine Engineers Association forwarded the Ministry's No. 2632 reply on the 10th of this month, stating that it has been received, checked, and Wang Qingfeng received the Class A Marine Engineer Certificate in December 1928, and only served on the Fuqing ship for three years and three months, and his qualifications do not meet the requirements of Article 1 of the Training Order No. 3239. The request for exemption from the exam and issuance of the certificate cannot be approved. You should immediately instruct the officer to report to the Ministry at any time for examination, as per the previous reply." After reading this reply, I was panicked and full of doubts. I will raise the points of incomprehension in order (1) Article 1 of Training Order No. 3239 clearly states that "seafarers who have obtained the captain or marine engineer certificate issued by this Ministry and have served in the positions listed on the certificate for more than five years," should be interpreted as referring to the qualifications before obtaining the certificate. If it is interpreted as after obtaining the certificate, not only is the meaning of the word "ever" not logically correct, but it is also inconsistent with the exemption method for seafarers who have not obtained a certificate in Article 2 of the same order, which states that "they have served in the position for more than ten years." Because this type of seafarer has never obtained a certificate at all, if the qualifications before obtaining the certificate are not recognized as valid, then where did the qualifications for more than ten years come from? Therefore, things are the same, and it can be understood by analogy (2) The validity period of the seafarer's certificate is five years, and the service qualifications for exemption from the exam are more than five years. If the service years before obtaining the certificate are not counted, then the five-year validity period of the certificate is insufficient, and what about the words "more than five years"? Is it not that the articles of the regulations contradict each other and cannot be self-consistent? (3) According to the original reply, the seafarer's service qualifications are valid from the date of obtaining the certificate. By analogy, I am afraid that none of the marine engineers who have obtained a certificate in the future who are subject to the original level examination will be able to pass, because the fifth item of Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Seafarer Examination states a total of eight years. In this method of exchanging certificates once every five years, is it not that each exchange will cancel the qualifications once, and how can the word "total" in the total of eight years be combined? Thinking quietly, can I not be speechless? Based on the three points listed above, the current regulations and the original reply have different meanings, and there must be a problem that has not been clarified, which makes people unable to adapt. For this reason, I have prepared a document to specifically state the reasons and hope that you will review and follow the instructions. It is really for the convenience of the public."</p>
<h3>Total Import and Export of Chinese Medicine in Seven Months of This Year</h3>
<p>Exports are mostly cinnamon, rhubarb, and licorice</p>
<p>Imports of American ginseng, amomum, and cardamom are still high</p>
<p>Zhu Dian, editor of Guanghua Medical Magazine, visited Wang Boyan, a statistics specialist at the International Trade Bureau, the other day to inquire about the recent import and export situation of Chinese medicine. According to the discussion, from January to July of this year, the export of Chinese medicine has gradually increased compared with the past. The types and quantities of exports include cinnamon 51.606 (quintals), worth 1.023.866 yuan, other cinnamon products 1.792 (quintals), worth 38.479 yuan, rhubarb 9.746 (quintals), worth 519.826 yuan, licorice 4936 (quintals), worth 346.495 yuan, Poria cocos 4.669 (quintals), worth 168.458 yuan, ginseng 149 (kilograms), worth 4.138 yuan, betel nut 67 (quintals), worth 1.044 yuan, medicines and nine powder plasters worth 141.543 yuan, imported fennel 4 (quintals), 170 (gold units, the same below), betel nut 6.429 (quintals), 78.397, amomum and cardamom 199.029 (kilograms), 173.445, American ginseng 1.921.384 (taels), 961.977. Although the export of Chinese medicine has gradually improved, there are still many imports of American ginseng, amomum, cardamom, betel nut, and other items. In view of this, Guanghua Medical Magazine plans to fully use the authority of public opinion to awaken people in the national medical community to reduce the use of foreign drugs and, when prescribing, try to replace them with other drugs within the possible range, so as to stop the leakage. At the same time, it will cooperate with the Rural Medicine Improvement Society to first start from the branch societies in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shanxi, and Henan provinces to investigate the actual situation of Chinese medicine producing areas and improve the planting, harvesting, and preparation methods using scientific methods in order to seek overseas sales and save the declining rural economy.</p>
<h3>Name Correction of Two-Road Business Offices</h3>
<p>The names of the business offices established by the Two Roads are often ambiguous. For easy distinction, the Traffic Department of the bureau has approved the administration to correct the names of the business offices from September 1st of this year as follows: (1) Jing'an Temple Road Business Office is changed to Shanghai First Business Office of the Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway (2) Shanghai South City Business Office is changed to Shanghai Second Business Office of the Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway (3) Nanjing Business Office is changed to Nanjing Business Office of the Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway</p>
<h3>Publication of Newly Edited Publications by the Institute of International Affairs</h3>
<p>Abstracts and Translations of Essays from Newspapers and Magazines of Various Countries</p>
<p>The Institute of International Affairs of this city originally had a monthly publication called "Newsletter," which specifically published association affairs and international news. The previous board of directors discussed publication matters, and all believed that the essays on the Far East issue published in newspapers and magazines of various countries are very important and are happy for members to know. However, the opinions are scattered in various newspapers, and it is difficult to collect them, and the length is too long, which is difficult to read. To facilitate the members, it was decided to change the editorial policy of the "Newsletter" to publish more various essays, excerpt the main points, extract the essence, and attach international news and association affairs. It is reported that the "Newsletter 1" of the association in August has now been published, and the content has been completely renewed. The main essays are "The Prelude to the 1935 Naval Conference" and "The Strategy of the Second Russo-Japanese War" are excerpted from the American "Foreign Affairs Quarterly," "The New Entente" is excerpted from the British "New Statesman and Nation," "Inferences from the European War" is excerpted from the American "Foreign Affairs Magazine," "The Powers' Seizure of the Chinese Market" is excerpted from the Japanese "Remodeling."

<h3>Fu Xiaoan Will Appeal to Yan Again</h3>

<h3>Household Industry Society Initiates Cosmetics Exhibition</h3>
<p>Inside the Invincible Brand Distribution Office</p>
<p>Unite with the Industry as a Whole to Face the Outside World</p>
<p>The Household Industry Society, in view of the huge amount of cosmetics imports, believes that it is impossible to face the outside world and hope to recover it without uniting the industry and cooperating as a whole. Therefore, it has created a cosmetics exhibition in the Nanjing Road Invincible Brand Distribution Office of the company in Shanghai. This move has a great impact on the future of national cosmetics and is attracting attention from all parties. Its declaration is as follows: The malpractices of our country's commerce lie in</p>
<p>Both lose and hurt. Looking around Europe, the West, Japan, and the United States, the development of each industry must have a united group to support its power and consolidate it. The so-called joint-stock company in Japan is the most obvious effect. The company feels this way and wants to try it, so it has initiated a cosmetics exhibition. The purpose is to have each industry have a sense of mutual contact and mutual comparison. The company's distribution office is located in the lively area of Nanjing Road, with convenient transportation, and it is suitable as a venue, so it does not hesitate to sacrifice its own position and be a place for the exhibition of products from most industry factories. To try the previous effect, please start with me.</p>

Therefore, the civil and criminal courts still heard cases as usual in the afternoon, and the civil and criminal litigation departments also received complaints in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Second Collection of the Universal Library Will Be Printed</h3>
<p>Sales and Reservations Soon</p>
<p>In the past ten years, domestic publishers have become more and more visionary and their plans have become more and more advanced. In addition to reprinting ancient books and compiling series of books, they have expanded the scope, carefully selected subjects, and compiled libraries for all levels. The materials are widely available, and the total price is cheap. The most contributions and efforts in this area are made by the Commercial Press. After the company was attacked in 1932, it identified learning, defending the country, and saving the country as the fundamental plan. In terms of ancient books, it reprinted the rare editions of the Complete Library in Four Sections, the Continuation of the Four Series, and many local chronicles. At the same time, it compiled and printed the University Series, so that universities could use Chinese textbooks as teaching materials. The Universal Library continued to be published, and the Little Student Library and the Children's Literary Section were printed. The materials were available in all subjects. Those who obtained the books could become a complete library without waiting for others. In recent years, the general libraries or the children's departments of libraries or school libraries that have been established have not started without the publication of various libraries. Recently, the company has realized that these types of books are helpful to the dissemination of culture and are not superficial. There will be a continuation of the second collection of the Universal Library soon. The first collection has been published, including 2,000 official books and 10 reference books. It is heard that the second collection is also 2,000 official books, all of which are the essence of each subject. The reference books include the Ten Classics and the Peiwen Yunfu.

<h3>Zhabei No. 0 Exchange Officially Opened Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Additional Exchanges Installed in Pudong District Can Be Implemented Next Month</p>
<p>Xu Xueyu, Yu Bingjian, and Putin Attended the Telecommunications Conference</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in view of the increasingly busy telephone business in the Chinese, rental, and silver circles, has found that the original equipment is insufficient. Therefore, it has successively expanded the automatic equipment in the north and south cities and added a two-person "No. 0 One" exchange in Zhabei to connect to the concessions. The project has been completed by the chief engineer Yu Bingjian and engineers Wang Wu Zhu and others, working day and night. The test call was made at 1:00 am yesterday morning, and the results were exceptionally clear. It was officially opened for communication at 1:15 am. From now on, Jiangwan, Zhengu, Wusong, and other places will be connected to the concessions through Zhabei.</p>
<p>(Additional Small Exchanges Installed in Pudong) Since the Shanghai Telephone Bureau recovered the telephone in Pudong from the Shanghai Telephone Company of the Concession according to the temporary telephone contract, it has spared no effort to improve the trunk lines and expand the business. However, due to the short time, it has not been able to install small exchanges and fully improve them according to the methods of each district. It is heard that the various small exchanges ordered by the bureau from Siemens Foreign Bank, China Electric Company, and New Electric Company will be delivered within this month. After the Ministry sends members to formally accept them, they can be formally upgraded. The time is about mid-October.</p>
<p>(Chief Engineer Went to Beijing to Attend) Xu Xueyu, Director of the Telephone Bureau, has completed all the construction of the Nanchang telephone after being ordered to reorganize it, and it has been officially opened for communication.

The representatives went to the Municipal Government with a petition at 10:00 am yesterday. The third section staff member Xiang Wei Cheng received them. The representatives first stated that because the market was sluggish and the people were suffering, they wanted to be allowed to reduce rents by decree. Mr. Xiang said that he would forward the intentions of the representatives to the mayor, but the matter was important, and the Municipal Government had to be prudent and detailed about the rent reduction issue requested by all parties. It can only be handled after the plan is properly planned.</p>
<h3>Violent Robbers Break Into Xietai Money Exchange in the Early Morning</h3>
<p>When Pushed Out by Staff Inside</p>
<p>Two Robbers Apprehended and Handguns Confiscated</p>
<p>At approximately 9:40 AM yesterday, four robbers suddenly appeared at the Xiekang Money Exchange, located at No. 35, Alley 515 (Ruyi Lane), at the intersection of Beijing Road and Henan Road. Two robbers stood guard outside, while the other two stormed into the exchange's business hall. At the time, staff members of the exchange saw unfamiliar men rushing in and immediately stepped forward to stop them, asking what they wanted. The robbers falsely claimed to be visiting a Mr. Shen, but the exchange had no such employee. Seeing that the robbers looked flustered, the staff realized they were not good people and pushed them out, tightly closing the iron gate. At the same time, they instructed a rickshaw puller to go out the back door and report to the watchman to call the police. The robbers noticed this and hurriedly fled out of the lane. The watchman immediately gave chase upon seeing them, blowing his whistle frantically. Patrolmen stationed at nearby police kiosks arrived upon hearing the alarm and apprehended two men running towards them. They searched them and confiscated a handgun. Meanwhile, the watchman also caught one of the robbers on Ningbo Road and confiscated another handgun. All of them were immediately taken to the police station for detention, pending interrogation by the court tomorrow morning. A search for the remaining fugitives is underway.</p>
<h3>Digging Mud and Damaging Embankments: Eleven People Including Shi A-jun Arrested</h3>
<p>Recently, a large number of Jiangbei people have been digging mud on the滩地 banks of the Wusong and Yunzao rivers, secretly transporting it for sale to make profits. This has caused the soil near the banks to become loose and sink, with layers of shovel marks, damaging the embankments. With the autumn tides rising, there is a risk of breaches at any time. After Wusong Municipal Committee member Tang Chengzong learned of this, he immediately sent staff to notify the water patrol, and Patrol Officer Li led police to arrest eleven people, including Shi A-jun and Yao Sanlang. After questioning the team, their statements were evasive. Considering the serious nature of endangering the seawall's safety, they were escorted to the General Bureau yesterday with a formal document for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Benefaction to Residents in the City Center</h3>
<p>Orders Xingye Society to Build a Small Vegetable Market</p>
<p>The city center of this city has recently become increasingly prosperous, with a rapid increase in population. The first batch of residences built and sold by the City Xingye Trust Society has long been sold out, and homeowners have already moved in. Furthermore, the Shanghai Bank's small Western-style houses at the intersection of Guohe Road, priced at four dimes, have also been sold out, and dozens of alley houses have been built. Mayor Wu, considering that the number of residents in the city center is increasing daily and that it is inconvenient for them to purchase daily necessities from afar, has specially ordered the Shanghai City Xingye Trust Society to build a vegetable market in an area with dense residential population. The society, adhering to the Mayor's aim of prospering the city area and facilitating the public, has accelerated the completion of the overall plan. All the columns of the building will be made of reinforced concrete and will be equipped with toilets and modern sanitary facilities. On both sides of the vegetable market, ten city-owned houses will be added to open small-scale department stores, selling various daily necessities and Chinese and Western medicines at prices identical to those on the market. Tenders for this project will be invited soon, and it is expected to be completed within the year. It is said that the style of the vegetable market and city-owned houses will be very novel, and the rent will be extremely low, making it even more convenient for residents in the city center.</p>
<h3>Lin Huantang Accused of Abandoning His Wife and Living with a Japanese Woman</h3>
<p>Police Filed Public Prosecution</p>
<p>Lin Found Not Guilty Yesterday</p>
<p>Lin Yuting, a native of Taishan, Guangdong, accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars by running a pharmacy. He recently died of illness last month, leaving behind multiple wives, concubines, and children. His son, Lin Huantang, now 28 years old, married Li Fengchun, a woman from his hometown, in Guangzhou in 1922 through a matchmaker. After marriage, the couple's relationship was initially harmonious. Later, because Lin wanted to study abroad, he left his beloved wife six months after the wedding and went overseas to study in the United States. He has been there for several years. Although he once returned to China, he soon left his wife again for the United States. This time, Lin Huantang returned after completing his studies, but unexpectedly, Lin had met a Japanese woman named Mishi in the United States and brought her back to Shanghai. As a result, the two women could not share a husband, and conflicts arose in the family, with constant quarrels. In the end, Lin favored the beautiful Japanese woman and even mistreated his wife, making her live elsewhere and neglecting to provide for her. Li Fengchun was furious and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court. After the trial, it was ruled that, according to law, spouses could not file lawsuits against each other, and the case was dismissed. However, Lin believed that Li's actions had severed the bond between them, so he also hired a lawyer to file for divorce in the civil court. This case is currently being heard. Unexpectedly, Li Fengchun, unable to bear the fact that her husband favored a foreign woman, living freely and treating his wife like discarded shoes with frequent mistreatment and abandonment, in addition to filing a counterclaim in the civil court and requesting litigation relief, also hired lawyer Ge Zhaoji to report to the Chengdu Road Police Station, requesting a public prosecution. This was approved, and the Special Court issued a summons yesterday morning to bring Lin Huantang to the Eighth Criminal Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi held a hearing. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that he was filing a public prosecution against the defendant Lin Huantang for abandonment under Article 310 of the Criminal Law, and stated that the plaintiff Li Fengchun married the defendant in Guangzhou in 1922 and lived with him for six months before the defendant went to the United States to study in the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Kingpin Zhou Shengfa Escorted to Garrison Headquarters for Legal Action Yesterday</h3>
<p>Strict Interrogation at the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Categorically Denies Selling Red Pills</p>
<p>The case of the North Railway Station, which caused a social uproar, where seven large packages of Feima brand red pills, totaling 4.2 million pills, were intercepted by the Municipal Public Security Bureau on February 4 of this year, and the subsequent arrest of five red pill offenders, including Wang Weicheng and Zhao Zuoting, on February 23 and 24, was handed over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. After the case was investigated and the facts of the crime were confirmed, they were sentenced to death in accordance with the strict ban on highly addictive drugs and reported to Chairman Chiang for execution by firing squad. However, Zhao confessed that the kingpin was Zhou Shengfa. On the evening of August 17, Zhou was arrested by Lu Ying of the Detective Team of the Bureau, led by Detective Team Leader Ling Tianpeng, and transferred to the Nanshi District Court. The details of his transfer to the team by Detective Team Leader Ling with a document from the court the day before yesterday were reported in this newspaper. However, Zhou Shengfa, after being strictly interrogated by the Detective Team on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, was handed over to Section Chief Huang Hua of the Bureau's Third Section for legal processing by the Interrogation Division. According to reporters, Zhou's statements to the Detective Team and the Third Section, apart from the record of his age, origin, address, and occupation (silk industry), categorically denied the manufacture and sale of red pills. He also claimed that he did not know about the claim by the already executed Wang Weicheng that Zhou was the red pill kingpin, alleging it was a malicious accusation. Therefore, Zhou's attitude during the interrogation was natural and unafraid. After reviewing the confession, Director Wen found that although Zhou firmly denied it, the arrest was ordered, and the situation was serious and complex, so he did not dare to act on his own. He immediately prepared a document at noon yesterday and sent Zhou Shengfa back to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation by Lu, led by Detective Team Leader Ling Tianpeng, .</p>
<p>△　△　△　△</p>
<p>Sixteen years later, he returned to China and lived with his wife again. The following year, they had a child, but it died soon after. At the same time, the defendant continued to go to the United States. Li Fengchun also came to Shanghai from her hometown in October last year and lived with the defendant's parents at No. 99 Yongfeng Lane, North Sichuan Road. Before long, the defendant returned from abroad, bringing with him a Japanese woman named Mishi, claiming that she was someone he had met in the United States, and they began living together. Within a few months, due to the incompatibility between the two women, quarrels broke out. The defendant ordered Li to live separately in Demin Lane, Jiaxing Road, and only paid her ten yuan at the time, without further payments. Later, Li, unable to make ends meet, hired a lawyer to write to the defendant, requesting to live together, but was rejected. She then filed a lawsuit, which was dismissed. Recently, Li, accompanied by lawyer Ge, went to the police station to request a public prosecution, so a prosecution was filed according to law. According to the report, when questioning the defendant Lin Huantang about the circumstances of Li Fengchun's complaint, he admitted to living with a Western woman, but claimed that Li Fengchun was indeed his wife and was currently living with his mother and others at No. 3 Deshun Lane, Maigen Road, with full provision of food, clothing, and shelter. How could there be abandonment? Now I have filed a divorce lawsuit in the civil court, and Li has also filed a counterclaim, etc. After arguments by both lawyers, Judge Wu Tingqi acquitted Lin Huantang in court, arguing that the civil suit should await the verdict of the civil court.</p>
<h3>Land Price Tax Still Levied on Profitable Charity Land</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation sent a letter to various charities stating, "Regarding the petition submitted by this Federation to the Shanghai Municipal Government on August 30, No. 2068, requesting exemption from land price tax for charity land without profits and requesting a 50% reduction for land with profits, all have been received. The Financial and Land Bureaus have replied stating, 'We have investigated the case of the Shanghai Charity Federation's request for reduction or exemption of land price tax on the organization's land. We have previously received instructions from your government to review and discuss this matter. Our bureau, etc., have jointly reviewed and discussed the case. Regarding the part of the land with profits, although the organization has presented the difficulty of funding and submitted a budget of income and expenditure, which was forwarded by the Social Bureau for consideration of reduction or exemption, the exemption of land price tax should be limited to land that meets the requirements of Article 2, Section 2 of the Provisional Regulations on Land Price Tax Collection, which is used for public charity purposes and has no profits. Now that the land in question has profits, land price tax should be levied according to the above regulations, and it is difficult to reduce or exempt.

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Asks the Municipal Council to Cancel the One-Way Traffic Regulation on Hankou Road</h3>
<p>Customers See It as a Hindrance, Greatly Affecting Shops</p>
<p>Do Not Merely Facilitate Staff's Access, Disregarding Citizens' Welfare</p>
<p>Since the implementation of one-way traffic on Hankou Road, the shops on the road have been greatly affected. They jointly wrote to the Taxpaying Chinese Association requesting the Municipal Council to cancel it. The Taxpayers' Association wrote to the Municipal Council requesting prompt cancellation. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Letter: Regarding the one-way traffic on Hankou Road, we have received a letter from the shops on the road, jointly signed and stamped, requesting cancellation. After reviewing the points mentioned in the letter, they are indeed facts. The Municipal Council believes that "customers may feel inconvenienced at the beginning of the implementation of one-way traffic, but if given time and implemented for a long time, this inconvenience will gradually decrease." This statement has not been proven. It is no wonder that citizens are saying that the Municipal Council only knows how to facilitate the access of its staff, but has not considered the adverse effects on the business of the shops on the road. We are attaching the original letter from the shops on the road for your attention and prompt cancellation of the one-way traffic regulation on Hankou Road, so that the shops on the road will not continue to experience adverse effects on their business. Addressed to: Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement</p>
<p>Shops' Letter: Since the implementation of one-way traffic on Hankou Road, traffic has been restricted, and customers see purchasing goods as a hindrance, leading to a decline in business for all shops on the road. Some have closed down, others have moved away, and vacant houses abound with no one interested. Those who have not yet closed down or moved are also in a precarious situation. We recall that when the one-way traffic was piloted in April 1930, the shops on the road jointly wrote to your association and the Chamber of Commerce for Transfer, requesting the Municipal Council to cancel it. We received a reply stating that customers may feel inconvenienced by the implementation of one-way traffic, but if given time and implemented for a long time, this inconvenience will gradually decrease. The request for cancellation was not granted. However, after investigation, most of the goods sold by the shops on this road are ordinary goods that are also available on nearby roads. Customers are willing to drive to purchase goods, but if they happen to encounter one-way traffic, they will abandon this road and go to another. Customers are the lifeblood of shops, and shops rely on customers to survive. The Municipal Council's implementation of one-way traffic on this road is indirectly putting the shops to death. The principle of municipal facilities is to seek the welfare of taxpayers. Now the Municipal Council has not sought the welfare of the shops and property owners who pay large amounts of property tax annually, but has already added to the destruction. For the sake of our own interests, we specially request your association to forward a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, promptly cancelling the one-way traffic regulation on Hankou Road to maintain commerce. We are awaiting your urgent response. Addressed to: Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association</p>

<h3>Zhu Maocheng Clarifies the Truth About False Accusations</h3>
<p>Zhu Maocheng of the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee, clarifies the truth about the false accusations, stating: "Last month, a rickshaw puller deflated tire incident occurred in this port. The Police Department of the Municipal Council filed a public prosecution against Zheng Fazhu and four others. The first instance trial concluded on the 30th of last month, and the verdict has been announced. However, because at the continued hearing of the case at the First Special District Court on the 24th of last month (i.e., Friday), I received reports afterward that two witnesses for the plaintiff, Xu Hanyuan and Wang Zhaosheng, etc., when giving testimony against the defendant Zheng Fazhu for fraud and embezzlement, one of them, Wang Zhaosheng, fabricated incidents out of thin air and greatly defamed me. The most important point was that when the defendant Zheng Fazhu paid the rickshaw license deposit on his behalf, he handed over 40 yuan to me in the name of a handling fee, etc. Because I was not present in court at the time, I did not have the opportunity to respond. After receiving the report, I specifically requested Judge Zhan, who was hearing the case, on the 30th of last month, whether I could issue a statement to clarify the truth to the public. Judge Zhan believed that the testimony was a minor issue and not related to the case, and that it was not necessary to issue a statement. Therefore, I still did not have the opportunity to respond. Later, the court announced the verdict. Except for the part about deflated tires, which had a separate verdict, all the points testified by Xu Hanyuan, Wang Zhaosheng, etc., were unfounded and were not punished. This shows that the court was also aware of the falsity of this defamation. I had no need to defend myself further. However, fearing that the outside world may not fully understand the truth, I am specially presenting the content of the statement that I wanted to issue to all sectors of society. According to the report, Wang Zhaosheng claimed that the rickshaw license deposit and the so-called handling fee were handed over to the defendant Zheng Fazhu at 8:00 AM on the 8th of last month, at the office of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee. The money was first handed over to Zheng Fazhu, who then handed it over to the committee. Later, they saw a person in a white suit escorting Zheng out, and later learned that the person in the white suit was me. However, according to the facts, the office of this committee does not open until the stipulated office hours of 8:30 AM. I also arrived at the office at 8:30 AM on that day as usual. Furthermore, the task of collecting license deposits is handled by the money collector sent by the Bureau's Tax Department. He collects the money every day and hands it over to the Tax Department. The procedure is very clear. Although some members of this committee sign the receipts, they never meet with the payers, and I have never inquired about how Wang Zhaosheng and Xu Hanyuan paid their deposits, nor have I signed their payment receipts. This is the factual process, which can be proved by all the staff of this committee. After receiving the report, I repeatedly wrote to the chairman of this committee, requesting a thorough investigation, and asked to convey it to the Director-General of the Bureau, requesting that he order an investigation to determine whether the testimony of the witnesses was true, and whether the Legal Department had obtained sufficient and reliable evidence before hastily ordering the witnesses to make such public defamatory statements in the dignified court. After this letter was sent, I received a reply from the chairman of this committee stating, 'The defamation against you is obviously without any basis, which does not require further comment from me and my colleague Wang Zhiren.' Also, 'The collection of deposits is handled by the money collector sent by the Tax Department. Although we are responsible for signing the receipts, the receipts of Xu Hanyuan and Wang Zhaosheng were not handled by you, nor were they signed by you. Therefore, the slander is even more absurd.' After the chairman of this committee received my second letter, in addition to requesting the Director-General of the Bureau to investigate the truth of the matter, he also expressed to the Director-General that he hoped that police lawyer Ru Baoyi would fully correct the situation and express his apologies at the next hearing of the case against Zheng Fazhu, etc. Later, he received a reply from the Director-General, stating, 'This is a completely unrelated matter to the Bureau's case, and the Bureau has no intention of suggesting that Zhu Maocheng would request or receive handling fees... As for making corrections at the next hearing, I have also discussed it in detail with the police lawyer, hoping that Ru Baoyi would follow the statement. However, according to the police lawyer, "If Ru Baoyi were to make such a statement at this time, it would show that the Municipal Council does not trust Wang Zhaosheng's testimony, and would lose the effect of this prosecution." The above includes the experience of the court, the investigation by the chairman of this committee, and the clarification by the Municipal Council. The truth is not difficult for discerning people to explore. However, what I want to say is that I have the responsibility to serve society and the sincere desire to improve society. If there is an opportunity, I will not refuse hard work and complaints. Slander and insinuations will never succeed in the light of day. A swarm of mosquitoes making noise is limited to dark corners. I believe that all members of society have sympathy."</p>
<h3>Reasons for Reassessing Hotel Tax Amounts</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council issued a statement regarding the dispute between the hotel industry association and the re-evaluated tax amounts. The facts are that the Municipal Council recently reviewed the municipal tax assessments for sixteen hotels. As a result of the review, the rent paid by five of them to the landlords was roughly consistent with the current market rent, and the tax amount was calculated according to the rent without any problems. The other three were self-built houses, and their current assessments were found to be quite fair, so they were not changed. The remaining eight had their assessments modified to be roughly the same as the assessments of the aforementioned five renters. One of the eight has already accepted the amount revised by the Bureau.</p>
<p>As for the other seven hotels that raised objections to the Municipal Council, all of them were self-built houses. The current revised assessments are based on the rents paid by similar houses in the vicinity. In other words, the tax amounts for these seven hotels are estimated using the same method as for all homeowner-occupied houses, that is, based on their rental value. In fact, the amount assessed this time is even lower than the equivalent actual rent paid.</p>
<p>The Hotel Industry Association proposed that the Municipal Council take a comprehensive consideration of the matter, but because the circumstances of each hotel are different, it is in fact necessary to review them separately. Anyone who disputes the tax amount has the right to appeal to the Tax Assessment Committee, which is an impartial body that can investigate all the facts and determine whether the assessed amount is fair.</p>

<h3>Woman Seeks Coffin from Police Station</h3>
<p>Hoping to Encoffin and Bury Her Husband</p>
<p>Autopsy Confirms Death Due to Illness</p>
<p>Ma Jinbiao, a 54-year-old man from Yancheng, residing in a thatched hut east of Zhoujiadu in Pudong, worked as a laborer at various wharves along the beach. He recently succumbed to illness. His wife, Ma Yuan, lacking funds for the burial, conceived an outlandish idea and abruptly requested a coffin from the Third Precinct's Third Sub-station. The police station, finding the matter peculiar, questioned her about the illness. The woman stared blankly, offering no answer, which aroused suspicion of other underlying circumstances. Consequently, they instructed Zhang Rixin, the local bailiff of the tenth and eleventh districts, to report to the local court for an autopsy. Wu Dering, the commissioned prosecutor, along with Xuan Zhiming, the autopsy examiner, crossed the river to Pudong. The autopsy confirmed death due to illness. If the family lacked the means for burial, the bailiff was instructed to report to a charitable organization for coffin and burial assistance.</p>

<h3>Chunyang Lane Robbery Case: Accomplice Wang Laosan Apprehended</h3>
<p>Qin Wang, a woman from Ningbo residing at 190 Chunyang Lane, Dongyouheng Road, was robbed by multiple bandits who broke into her home around 7:00 PM on the 21st of January this year, stealing valuables worth eighty silver dollars. The Jiading Road police station, led by Detective Cheng Ying, arrested the perpetrators Chen Zhaolan, Kan Yuqi, Wu Xiaolong, and three others, and brought them to the First Special District Court. They were sentenced to prison. They confessed that Wang Laosan, from Jiangbei, was an accomplice and still at large. Recently, Wang, the detective in charge of the case, along with Detectives Gu Nvyao and Li Yinmin, learned that Wang was hiding in a house at 29 Tianbao Road, Zhabei. They coordinated with detectives from the Fifth Precinct’s Third Sub-station Public Security Bureau to arrest him at the address and bring him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, filed a claim in the Third Criminal Court, stating that the defendant denied being Wang Laosan at the police station, claiming to be Chen Afu. However, the convicted perpetrator Chen Zhaolan identified him as an accomplice. The defendant’s motion is therefore deemed credible and a postponement is requested. When questioned, the defendant confessed to knowing Chen, claiming that they had been imprisoned for robbery. After Chen’s release, Chen’s wife became involved with the defendant, leading to a feud. The defendant claimed that Chen made false accusations. The defendant expressed himself evasively and requested verification. Chen Zhaolan claimed that the defendant lived upstairs from his house. On the day of the robbery on Dongyouheng Road, the defendant invited Chen, Kan, and Wu to go to Qin’s house. The defendant held a sharp blade and together they robbed Qin’s house of fur coats and other items. Afterward, Kan Yuqi gave Chen three dollars and twenty cents. Chen stated that the defendant’s claim of having an affair with Chen’s wife was a lie. Qin Wang, the victim from Ningbo, stated that she was too frightened at the time to identify the defendant. Judge Wu Zehan ordered the defendant remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Silk Industry Bank Creates Flexible Fixed Savings</h3>
<p>A Type of "Half Deposit, Half Withdrawal" Savings</p>
<p>Excellent Interest Rates, Flexible and Convenient</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, located at the corner of Hankou Road and Fujian Road, has been actively promoting thrift and savings. It has created various innovative programs, such as "Establishment Savings," "Education Savings," "Happiness Savings," and "Three Benefits Savings." These programs have been innovative in their approach and offered excellent interest rates, making them popular with depositors. As a result, the bank's savings business has exceeded expectations. In the last accounting period, deposits increased dramatically by one-fold, with fixed deposits accounting for nearly seven-tenths of the total. This demonstrates the deep trust that the public has in the bank. The bank has now created a new type of flexible fixed savings, also known as "half deposit, half withdrawal" savings. This type of savings is half fixed and half current. Therefore, if funds are needed, half of the deposit can be withdrawn at any time. An account can be opened with a deposit of ten silver dollars, and any amount can be deposited at any time thereafter. The interest rate is eight to one percent, with interest accruing on interest. This savings program incorporates the strengths of various existing programs, offering significant benefits to depositors. This fresh approach is unprecedented. The bank previously held a contest to solicit a "Song of Thrift" and new savings programs. This flexible fixed savings program was one of the winning entries. Other entries are still being reviewed.</p>

<h3>Dehua Company Sells Suzhou Embroidery at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been a severe drought and extreme heat, setting a record not seen in decades. The rural areas have been particularly affected. Suzhou embroidery is traditionally a rural sideline, with men farming and women embroidering to make a living. Now, there is no land to cultivate and no seeds to sow. Men and women in the villages are turning to sidelines. The Dehua Suzhou Embroidery Company, with branches in Suzhou and Shanghai, has been established for years. Manager Cao Yougao, mindful of the bankruptcy of the rural areas, cannot bear to stand idly by. He is promoting sales in the spirit of mutual assistance to provide relief. However, for several months, the goods have been piling up like mountains. He has had to transport all the new goods to Shanghai for sale at low prices, displaying them at the Dehua branch company in Huajin Lane, Third Avenue, for special low-priced sales. Patriotic citizens should visit early to acquire beautiful embroidery and help the rural areas. It is a win-win situation.</p>

<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<p>Nine Star Grand Theater Presents Min Opera: Min opera and Beijing opera share the same origin. During the Tang Dynasty, people from Fujian served in the inner court, performing in Beijing dialect. During the Ming Dynasty, it flowed into Fujian and formed its own genre. During the Qing Dynasty, it continued to be popular. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the troupes declined, and it gradually became a thing of the past. The Xin Guofeng Troupe is the most famous in Fujian, renowned in Guangdong and Guangxi. However, it has been absent in Shanghai. Mr. Lin, a Min businessman in Shanghai, has brought together the troupe from the south, summoning it to Shanghai. With the assistance of Shanghai gentlemen such as Zhang Xiaolin, the troupe will perform at the Nine Star Grand Theater to promote and entertain the people of Shanghai. The troupe has over a hundred male and female performers, all famous Min opera actors with a unique singing style, blending plain tones and Min music. The troupe has brought over a hundred boxes of brand-new costumes and two hundred sets of stage scenery, all made by the famous artist He Junfu, which are novel and unique. The Nine Star Grand Theater has recently been renovated with a new interior layout. All the performers have arrived and, after a short rest, will take the stage. In this cool weather, all the people of Shanghai are invited to witness it.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>The Issue of Self-Study for Women After Marriage (Continued)</h3>
<p>| Reply to Liu Xunyue |</p>
<p>Of course, such harsh criticisms are not without foundation; the facts before us inevitably lead to such conclusions. However, this is merely a superficial observation and cannot be considered the fundamental cause of women's decline. While women themselves should bear some responsibility for their unwillingness to enter society after leaving school, the main reason is that the shackles of the old society have not been completely removed from women, or perhaps not removed at all.</p>
<p>Everyone generally believes that society has already liberated women by allowing them to attend school and socialize with men. In reality, this is not the case. We should further ask: has society provided women with the same social status as men and granted them independent economic standing? If not, then the fundamental purpose of women's education in today's society is to produce decorations, or even modernized commodities. We often observe the distress many women experience after marriage, a distress that can even destroy their love for their husbands. This is because of the conflict between their thoughts and their environment. They have strong desires for knowledge or careers; they aspire to be complete individuals and hope to contribute to society. However, what avenues are open to them? What kind of work can they find? Needless to say, in this wave of unemployment and panic, even many male university graduates struggle to find their place, let alone women. In fact, society has never considered this for women. Under the constraints of this environment, knowledge is essentially useless to them, providing neither food nor clothing, and their pursuit of education becomes limited to finding a husband. Progressive women may still struggle in extreme distress, but conservative women can only submit by redirecting their educational aspirations towards serving their husbands and raising children, or even resorting to playing mahjong and watching movies. Like your cousin's wife, this may not be because she is content with her decline, but rather because of the disharmony in her life (the disharmony between her thoughts and her environment), she is intentionally seeking stimulation, which is very possible.</p>
<p>Of course, this fate of women is not necessarily determined only after marriage; it is decided as early as when their parents send them to school. Parents rarely send their daughters to school with the hope of them becoming a Ph.D. or a great scholar; mostly, it is for their daughter's happiness, hoping they can find a good husband. However, marriage, in a woman's entire life process, is the first step of contact with society, which also signifies the end of their school life. People always have hopes and dreams, and women in school are no exception, harboring a passion for learning. However, once they come into contact with society, they find that other hopes are dashed, and with no path ahead, their desire for knowledge naturally diminishes. Therefore, although marriage is not the cause of hindering women's pursuit of knowledge, it makes women unable to avoid stepping into their pre-arranged fate. | To be continued |</p>

<p>Children's Spring and Autumn Weekly</p>
<h3>School Starts</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Children, time flies so fast, and in the blink of an eye, the summer vacation has already passed! In these fifty days, have you reviewed your lessons? Have you neglected your studies? You must reflect on this yourselves.</p>
<p>The summer vacation is over, and school is about to start again. Will you be able to advance to the next grade? Are you capable of handling the schoolwork with ease? You must also examine yourselves. If you have already been promoted, then you must continue to work hard in your studies. If you are unfortunately held back, then you must reverse your previous habits and start anew as a good student. The sage once said, "Do not hesitate to correct your mistakes." Who is a sage who can be without fault? However, one must know to correct one's mistakes. If one knowingly has faults but refuses to correct them, then that is bad!</p>
<p>Children, the fifty-day summer vacation is over, and now is the time for you to study hard! Children, work hard!</p>
<h3>Introducing a Child to You</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yide</p>
<p>Children! You probably all know Abraham Lincoln, the former President of the United States, right? But you may not know what he was like when he was a child. Let me tell you now!</p>
<p>He was born in Kentucky on February 12, 1809. He was very poor as a child, living in a small, dilapidated wooden house. A pile of messy straw served as his bed for the night. He was a very diligent worker, good at plowing, cutting grass, threshing, herding cattle, and other chores. There was nothing he couldn't do. He often helped his neighbors, so they liked him very much.</p>
<p>He was also very diligent in his studies, but he was too poor. He couldn't even afford to buy books, so he often borrowed them from others. If the person lived miles away, he would have to travel that far. Once, a book he borrowed, "The Biography of Washington," was accidentally damaged. He timidly begged the owner, who said to him, "If you work for me for three days, I'll give you the book." He got the book and diligently memorized it in his spare time, committing the entire book to memory.</p>
<p>He didn't have pens and paper to write with either. He used burnt charcoal to draw on the ground, walls, and stones. Although he was too poor to afford books, he studied diligently and perseveringly. Soon, he became the American President admired by all.</p>
<p>Children! Do you understand now? One must not give up on oneself, thinking that because there is no opportunity to study, one should not study. You should learn from Lincoln's hard work, and only then will you have a future! Children who have the opportunity to study, do not miss the time, and work hard!</p>
<h3>New Children's Song</h3>
<p>— Chengming</p>
<p>Sit in a row, eat fruit, everyone, please eat Chinese fruit. Rights and interests can be protected, and loopholes can be prevented. Rather be hungry than eat those imported goods.</p>
<p>Children, high aspirations, respect teachers at school, respect elders at home. Brothers and sisters must be loving, and greet friends with a smile.</p>
<p>Not reading books is the most distressing, a blind person is laughed at. Unable to do great things, nor become a good old man. Do you think you will regret it?</p>
<p>Children, be diligent and thrifty. Study hard, all expenses must be frugal. Know that parents work hard to earn their sweat and blood money, providing tuition is already strained, how can you squander and waste money recklessly?</p>
<h3>Small Animal Research</h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>(Can Earthworms Sing?) Min'er caught an earthworm and saw that its mouth was extremely small, not like it had a sound-producing organ. However, he saw the phrase "earthworm singing" clearly in ancient books, so he ran to ask his father.</p>
<p>Father said, "The sounds of insects are mostly produced by vibrating membranes beneath their wings. Earthworms have no membranes; there are no sound-producing organs in their mouths, so how can they sing? Originally, there is another kind of mole cricket in the soil, and its burrows are close to the earthworms. It has wings and membranes, and it vibrates its membranes to make music in its burrow. The ancients did not observe carefully and thought it was the earthworm singing. In reality, earthworms can only dig soil and absolutely cannot sing."</p>
<p>After listening to his father's words, Min'er realized that many things need to be investigated in person. "It is useless to believe everything in books."</p>
<p>(Distinguishing Beneficial and Harmful Birds) The small birds on the branches, with their beautiful feathers and melodious songs, are loved by everyone. However, among these many birds, some are beneficial to us, and some are harmful to us. How do we distinguish them?</p>
<p>Birds also need to eat and drink. Some like meat and specialize in pecking at small insects in the fields and trees. These birds indirectly help horticulture and farming, so they are beneficial. There are also birds that are vegetarians and specialize in pecking at good grains and fruits, etc. Aren't they directly harmful to humans?</p>
<p>Beneficial birds that peck at harmful insects mostly have pointed beaks and long tails, and they are very fast at killing. Swallows are representatives of beneficial birds. Harmful birds that peck at grains mostly have blunt beaks and short tails, and they are not very agile in flight. The sparrows we see every day are representatives of this type.</p>
<h3>Cao Cao Leads Troops Down the Yangtze</h3>
<p>— Xue Fan</p>
<p>Who doesn't say so, little brothers and sisters like to listen to stories, even more than eating and sleeping!</p>
<p>My sixth younger brother, like ordinary children, always pesters whoever comes, whether it's Sister-in-law Zhang or Sister Li, to tell him stories.</p>
<p>One day: Cousin Xu came to visit, and my sixth brother, as usual, stated his request:</p>
<p>"Brother! Do you have any new stories to tell me?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I'll tell you the story of Cao Cao going down the Yangtze."</p>
<p>"Good! Tell it!"</p>
<p>A sweet smile hung on the corner of his mouth, and my cousin also opened his mouth with a grinning smile:</p>
<p>"It is said that in the past, Cao Cao, 丨丨 do you know Cao Cao?" Cousin suddenly asked.</p>
<p>"I know, I know!" Sixth brother said quickly, "Isn't he a villain?"</p>
<p>"Yes! At that time, he was fighting with Zhou Yu, and Cao Cao led an army of 800,000 men down the Yangtze, in a mighty and imposing manner." Saying this, sixth brother smiled strangely.</p>
<p>"This army of 800,000 men suddenly had to cross a small wooden bridge. One by one, the 800,000 men crossed the bridge. The first one crossed, then the second one: The second one crossed, then the third one:: : Tak, tak,:: : Tak, tak,:: :"</p>
<p>Sixth brother became anxious and said, "What happened after the 800,000 men crossed the bridge?"</p>
<p>"How could 800,000 men cross it all at once? The third one crossed, then the fourth one: the fourth one crossed:: : Tak, tak,:: ; Tak, tak,:: :"</p>
<p>"Then it won't be finished even tomorrow!" Sixth brother said angrily.</p>
<p>"Of course, it's a small wooden bridge! How can it be fast?" Cousin smiled slyly.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay!" This time, sixth brother said boredly that he didn't want to listen, and quietly left.</p>
<h3>Two Useless Things on the Human Body</h3>
<p>— Ning Ziqiang</p>
<p>Children: The more things are used, the more effective they become. If they are not used, they are wasted, which is true for machines, and also true for the organs of the human body. For example, people have knowledge because of their brain organs, and animals do not have knowledge because they do not know how to use their brain organs. However, there are two things on our human body that are gradually being eliminated because we do not use them, such as the appendix and toes, are they purely useless things?</p>
<p>(1) Appendix: The appendix is the upper part of the large intestine, connecting to the small intestine above and connecting to the colon below. Because our ancestors were herbivores in the ancient times, they had to go through the appendix. Later, when they changed to eating meat, the appendix became a tumor-like thing, which is useless and has the risk of inflammation. If it is not removed, it can be fatal.</p>
<p>(2) Toes: Toes were also used by our ancestors to climb trees, but they have gradually been eliminated, resulting in shortening and degeneration into inch-long things, which will be completely eliminated in the future!</p>
<h3>Clock Talk</h3>
<p>— Xinyu</p>
<p>Children, at any time, you use the clock to do your work. But, were there clocks in primitive times? Where did the clock come from? Wouldn't you like to know?</p>
<p>In the beginning, there were no clocks in the world. People used the shadows of the sun and the positions of the stars to calculate the time. Later, they became smarter and used burning candles to measure the passage of time.</p>
<p>Babylon was the first to invent the clock, probably 2,800 years ago. However, the clocks at that time did not have hands. They relied on the sun to be used. It was a very simple sundial. At night, water flowing out of the pot was used to calculate the time, or milk, and some used sand.</p>
<p>Later, water clocks were invented, and the assembly was much more sophisticated than the flowing water pot. The clocks were engraved with degrees, but they were not very popular, and only nobles could use them.</p>
<p>After the Crusades, a clock with a hammer was brought from Palestine. This was a great progress in clocks, but no one knows who invented it. 650 years ago, there was a tower clock in the London Parliament. This was the first tower clock in the world.</p>
<p>250 years ago, there were portable clocks in the world. Then, watches appeared. A few years later, Galileo changed the hammer to a pendulum, so the clocks became more refined and accurate.</p>
<p>After that, there were clocks with minute hands up to 3.5 meters long, clocks with mechanical animals that could play the piano and tell the time, and clocks that could indicate the date and the position of the stars. Children, do you think it's strange? But, don't be surprised. The inventor of more strange and refined clocks in the world is you!</p>
<p>Children's Science Lecture</p>
<h3>Light</h3>
<p>— Linyin</p>
<p>When we see a fire burning, it emits a raging light. Where does this light come from? This is the expression of heat reaching its highest degree. When light shines into our eyes, it travels in a straight line. Therefore, when we watch movies in the cinema, as long as there is something blocking in front of us, we cannot see clearly. However, when light encounters an object, it can be reflected back and travel. This phenomenon is called the reflection of light. Suppose you and a friend are standing facing each other on the sand, with a distance of more than ten feet apart. Put a board in the middle and throw the ball on the board. The ball will definitely bounce back like (Figure 2). The friend standing opposite you will catch the ball. When he hits the ball on the board, you can catch the ball. Therefore, if you stand slightly off to the side, you cannot see your own image, but you can see the image of the person next to you. This is the reflection of light. As on the front of the mirror, you can see your own image, and the ball bounces straight up in the same direction as it was hit down (Figure 1).</p>
<p>The reflection of light can form a mirror. The ones we usually use are plane mirrors. If we use something that is not flat, then the reflection of light will be different. If you use a tin can and a copper spoon to look at your face, it will definitely be very funny. So some people use convex and concave mirrors to make funhouse mirrors (Figures 3 and 4).</p>
<p>If we place a pencil obliquely in a bowl of water, it looks like the pencil is bent upwards (Figure 5). In fact, the pencil has not changed in any way when placed in water. It is caused by the refraction of light. The reason is very simple. As shown in Figure 5, when light from A to C emerges from the water surface, it bends towards D to travel. Therefore, when looking along the straight line CD, it seems that A floats up to B. So the pencil inserted in the water seems to float up. If you put the pencil in a glass, it looks like the pencil is broken through the glass wall (Figure 6). This is because the light emitted from the pencil in the water is refracted when it goes from the water to the air. You can put a copper coin at the bottom of the bowl, put the bowl on the table, and slowly move back until you can't see the copper coin. Then ask someone to fill the bowl with water, and you can see the copper coin again. This is the best way to test the refraction of light.</p>
<p>The phenomenon changes again when light passes through a convex lens. If you try it in the way shown in (Figure 7). The candle flame is inverted after passing through the lens. This is a very interesting thing. The reason will be explained next time.</p>
<h3>The Fly's Autobiography</h3>
<p>— (Chen Yizhen)</p>
<p>I am a fly, wearing a shiny green coat, and my head is red, so my kind praise my beauty very much.</p>
<p>My nature is that I like dirty places the most. Trash cans, piles of dog manure, watermelon peels, and all unclean places are good places for me to breed seeds.</p>
<p>My body is covered with cholera germs, so the food I visit will leave a little bacteria, which will cause people to develop cholera when they eat it.</p>
<p>Because of these green reasons, people drive me away and hurt me when they see me, calling me the medium of cholera.</p>
<p>When I am eating and playing, I have to be on guard at all times against people's palms and rackets from coming to my body. Especially pay attention to children, because they like to catch me and feed me to ants.</p>
<p>I can hum tunes, and the tune is called "Buzzing Tune". If I find a pile of manure, I have to hum the tune happily and try this fresh food.</p>
<p>People are smart and have invented several machines to catch us, but no matter how smart you are, we still hum and fly around the garbage cans.</p>
<h3>Correspondence from Rural Children</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>Early Autumn</p>
<p>Dear Children:</p>
<p>The sky is gradually getting higher, and cool golden winds are blowing from time to time; especially in the morning and evening, it feels very cool. The sultry heat will probably be eliminated in the shortest time.</p>
<p>Listen! The cicada's voice is hoarse, the green frog beats the final retreat drum, and the fireflies have also extinguished their light; so, is the earth lonely? No, definitely not! This is actually a very lively world: the weaver girl's "zhi zha zhi zha", the spinning girl's "sha sha sha", the cricket's "qu qu qu", hundreds of insects are chirping, as if holding an autumn music conference.</p>
<p>The cricket opened its jaws and fought to the death with its peers; with the spirit of fighting to the death, it decided the male and female, and the winner flapped its wings and sang loudly before returning. This kind of "fratricidal" action is certainly wrong, but since the other party has a fighting spirit, in order to protect one's own life, one can't care about anything, one can only fight hard! Then, when China is bullied by strong neighbors, it actually bows its hands and doesn't even fight a few rounds, doesn't it even have the courage of a cricket? Children! We should invigorate our vigor and vow not to be someone inferior to a cricket!" "Shoulder my gun and resist the enemy!"! The weather is hinting to us.</p>
<h3>How to Keep the Brush Head from Falling Off</h3>
<p>— Teng Jinbiao</p>
<p>Children: Are you very annoyed when you see the brush head falling off? Because it is not easy to put it back on after it falls off, but I have a method that can keep it from falling off forever. I will write it below now:</p>
<p>(1) Go to a traditional Chinese medicine store to buy some rosin, crush it, and then put some in the mouth of the brush handle where the brush head has fallen off.</p>
<p>(2) Smoke it over the fire to melt the rosin (be careful not to burn the brush handle).</p>
<p>(3) Rotate the brush handle so that the inside of the brush handle is covered with melted rosin.</p>
<p>(4) When the rosin is not yet solidified, immediately insert the brush head slowly, smoke it for a while, and it will be firm after a while.</p>
<p>After being installed like this, it will not fall off even if it is soaked in water or shaken vigorously. You children may wish to try it.</p>
<p>(1) A New Pencil</p>
<p>(2) Plan How to Use It</p>
<p>(3) Sharpened to Draw Pictures</p>
<p>(4) Shorter and Shorter When Sharpened</p>
<p>(5) Engraving on the Heart Will Always Be Broken</p>
<p>(6) This Is How Things Ended!</p>

<h3>China and Germany Exchange Graduate Students to Promote Cultural Exchange</h3>
<p>The German Xiangbao Foundation, in order to promote cultural exchange between China and Germany, plans to send Ms. Kang to China to study Chinese literature and art. It has requested China to provide financial assistance and, at the same time, under the same conditions, also requested China to send a university student to Germany to study science for exchange. It is reported that the Chinese Ministry of Education has approved this exchange student research matter and will subsidize Miss Kang with 110 yuan per month from July of this year for a period of one year (research will be conducted at the Academia Sinica). It is also reported that the Chinese graduate student designated in Germany will also receive a monthly subsidy from Germany.</p>
<h3>The Northeastern Students' Simple Cafeteria's Term Expires; Executive Yuan Orders the Ministry of Education to Take Over</h3>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, many Northeastern students studying in Beiping and other places suffered hardships at home, and their economic sources were cut off. The Beiping Social Affairs Bureau, the Police Department, and other agencies investigated the situation of Northeastern students in various schools and reported to the Executive Yuan's Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee to try out the Northeastern Students' Simple Cafeteria to provide relief. The method was roughly as follows: Northeastern students first registered, went through the review procedures, and were issued registration certificates. Depending on the number of Northeastern students in each school, a simple cafeteria was set up in one school, or students from several schools were gathered at a suitable location to set up a simple cafeteria. Each student ate with a registration certificate. The trial period expired, and it was continued. After several years, the continuation period has expired again.

<h3>Dai Chuanxian drafts an outline for Chinese scout education</h3>
<p>The National Scout Association has been prepared, and the Ministry of Education has appointed Zhu Jiahua and fifteen others as directors. The association will be established soon, and the preparation office will be handed over soon. Dai Chuanxian, the director of the office, recognizing the importance of scout education, has drafted the "Outline for Chinese Scout Education" as an introduction to the office's work report. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese Scout aims to develop children's ability to act, cultivate good habits, make their personality noble, their knowledge rich, their physique healthy, and become young people with both wisdom, benevolence, and courage, to build a nation based on the Three Principles of the People, and to bring the world to universal harmony.</p>
<p>(2) The training principles of the Chinese Scout are as follows: (1) The Chinese Scout takes loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace as the highest principles of training. (2) The Chinese Scout, whether individual or group, shall not participate in political activities with the qualifications or name of the scout, but it is not restricted if they participate as citizens in accordance with the law, and there is no interference with the religion of personal belief. (3) The Chinese Scout should adopt the educational proposition of children as the foundation and the methods of modern scientific education, based on the state of children's life, physiology, and psychology, as the criterion for implementing training, to cultivate the basic abilities needed to serve the nation-state and society. (4) Chinese Scout training learns by doing and does by learning, so children should be given as many opportunities as possible to come into actual contact with nature and society to cultivate their various life skills and proper attitudes towards people and things. (5) The Chinese Scout training aims to make children aware that serving others is the greatest happiness, and to take the three words "Be Prepared", "Do a Good Turn Daily", and "Service is the Purpose of Life" as their motto.</p>
<p>(3) The Chinese Scout oath is as follows: So-and-so vows to abide by the teachings of the Premier, strictly abide by the rules of the Chinese Scout, and practice the following three things throughout his life: First, practice the teachings of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, and be a loyal citizen of the Republic of China. Second, help others and serve the public anytime, anywhere. Third, strive for the soundness of one's own knowledge, morality, and physique. Fourth, the Chinese Scout rules are as follows: (1) Honesty: The way to be a person lies in honesty. Whether doing things, speaking, or harboring intentions, one must be true and not deceive. (2) Loyalty and filial piety: One must be loyal to the country and filial to one's parents. (3) Helping others: Do one's best to help others, do at least one good deed every day, do not accept rewards, and do not take credit. (4) Benevolence and love: One must be affectionate to relatives and friends, kind to everyone, and care for things that are harmless to life. (5) Etiquette: One must be polite to people, and all responses should be in accordance with the rules. (6) Fairness: Understand things, distinguish right from wrong, treat people fairly, and handle things peacefully. (7) Obedience: One must strictly abide by group discipline and strictly obey national laws. (8) Happiness: One should always be happy, always smile, and remain calm no matter what difficulties one encounters. (9) Diligence and thrift: Be studious, practice diligently, endure hardships and be hardworking, do not waste time, and do not misuse money. (10) Courage: Do what is right without hesitation, do not be tempted by profit, do not be subdued by power, and do not care about success or failure. (11) Cleanliness: One's body, clothing, residence, and utensils must be clean, one's words must be cautious, and one's heart must be bright. (12) Public morality: Cherish public property, protect public interests, and do not hinder the public for personal convenience. The Premier said to the young people, "The first thing to do as a person is to set goals and do great things. One must take the country as one's own responsibility and shoulder the responsibility of building the future social cause." "What is called a great thing is to thoroughly accomplish whatever one studies, from beginning to end." The purpose of scout education is to create citizens who can shoulder great responsibilities for the country. Whether he is a farmer, a worker, a businessman, a soldier, an educator, or even a scholar or an official, he must be able to take on his own duties and careers and do well. Whether it is in standing in the world, to the family, to the society, to the country, one must always have good intentions, do good deeds, say good words, and be a good person. The four outlines listed above are good standards. Being able to do things at all times, consistently, and do them until old age and death is considered a good person. Things that are in line with these four outlines are considered good deeds. What one thinks in one's heart must not deviate from this, and that is considered a good intention. What one says in one's mouth must not deviate from this, and that is considered good words. If what one thinks in one's heart, what one says in one's mouth, and what one does are all integrated, constantly striving for self-improvement, and completing everything from beginning to end, then one has accomplished a great thing in life, is worthy of being a Chinese scout, and is worthy of being a citizen of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Two children's libraries in Zhabei, Nanshi, opened yesterday</h3>
<p>Chairman Pan Gongzhan reported the significance of the establishment</p>
<p>Representatives from the Education and Public Security Bureaus all gave speeches</p>
<p>The two children's libraries jointly organized by the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee and the Children's Morning Post opened jointly at He'an Primary School at 9:00 am yesterday. The attendees included Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau, Hu Shuyi, Yin Guanzhi of the Public Security Bureau, Zhao Zengqi, curator of the First Library, Qian Fugong, curator of the Second Library, Xu Shushen, principal of He'an School, and more than 200 guests and students from various schools.</p>
<p>Chairman's report: After performing the ceremony as usual, Director Pan, the chairman, first reported, saying that the Children's Welfare Association and the Children's Morning Post, in view of the fact that small book stalls are everywhere in the city, and most of the books on the stalls are for children to borrow, this can prove that children who are literate always like to read, but the content of the small books on the stalls is not good, which has a bad influence on children after reading, which is very important. At the same time, there is no proper library in the society for children to read, so we jointly established two children's libraries, selected appropriate books, and provided children with reading and guidance on proper knowledge to supplement the shortcomings of school education. We also hope that those who come to the children's library to read are not only students in school, but also children who have no opportunity to go to school or have dropped out of school. We welcome them to the children's library. There are only two libraries now, and of course we will expand and popularize them at any time in the future, making them as common as primary schools. However, some primary schools already have libraries. These books are completely for the students in the school. We hope that the schools can break the boundaries of the school and also provide the books in the school for children outside the school. Then its effectiveness will of course be more common. This is not only a supplement to school education, but also an extension of school education outside the school. Secondly, we also want to run mobile book borrowing vehicles to transport books to various roads for children to read for free. In fact, each school can also do this method, and its power will be greater. With this kind of place to read books, the kind of bad small book stalls in the past can be gradually eliminated. Finally, we hope that in the future, there will be at least one or two dozen tutors in each children's library to guide children to read. In this way, the children's library is equivalent to a small school. If we want to get knowledge for children outside the school, we must promote this kind of fact, and so on.</p>
<p>Preparation process: Next, Qian Fugong, curator of the Second Library, reported on the preparation work, saying that the preparation time for the first and second children's libraries cost a total of three months. The start-up costs of the two libraries were allocated by the municipal government for 500 yuan, and the recurring expenses were given by the Children's Morning Post for 50 yuan per month. The major bookstores in the city actively donated books, and now a total of more than 5,000 books have been obtained. Now the first library is located in He'an Primary School, and the second library is located near Jinbo, Penglai Road, Nanshi.</p>
<p>Speeches from all walks of life: Then Yin Guanzhi, representative of the Public Security Bureau, gave a speech, and Hu Shuyi, representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, gave a speech, saying that foreign countries attach great importance to children's undertakings, and there is a children's bureau to manage all children's affairs. It is still difficult for our country to establish this kind of organization at present, and the Children's Welfare Association is established by various agencies, and its nature is similar to that of foreign children's bureaus, specializing in seeking happiness for children. Now the association and the Children's Morning Post jointly run a children's library to increase children's knowledge, which is very rare. I hope that all the children will develop the habit of reading and often go to the children's library to read, and so on. There are also Qian Shenzhi of the New China Bookstore and Xu Shushen of He'an Primary School who gave speeches, omitted.</p>
<p>Children's performance: At the end, Yu Xuan of He'an Primary School and Gu Senbao of Danhua Primary School gave speeches as children's representatives, and Zhao Zengqi, curator of the First Library, gave a reply. Then they performed recreational activities. The programs included He'an's national music ensemble, golden basket, harmonica, Shangwen's horseback riding to Shandong, blowing bubbles, Danhua's comedy, lively dance, Qingguang's anti-enemy rhythm, and dispersed at about 12 o'clock.</p>

<h3>Rotary Cup Tennis Finals Day 1: China and the United States Evenly Matched</h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai Wins Straight Sets Against Squires</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Loses to Carlsen 3-1</p>
<p>| Doubles Match at 4 PM Today |</p>
<p>The first day of the Rotary Cup Shanghai International Tennis Tournament finals between China and the United States resulted in each country winning one singles match, leaving them evenly matched. Qiu Feihai easily defeated Squires in straight sets, while Zheng Zhaojia lost to Carlsen 3-1. Because of Qiu Feihai's veteran appearance, China's hopes suddenly increased, and victory seems assured. The doubles match between China and the United States will continue starting at 4 pm today, with Qiu and Lin competing, and victory seems without a doubt. Yesterday, about two to three hundred people watched, and the enthusiasm was good. The situation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Qiu Feihai Wins Big Against Squires</h3>
<p>In yesterday's first singles match, Qiu Feihai defeated Squires in straight sets, with the following scores:</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai (China) Six to Two Six to One Six to Zero Squires (USA)</p>
<p>Qiu's control over Squires could be described as adept, directing the game as he wished. Qiu's steady baseline shots forced Squires to retreat to the baseline to cope. However, despite Squires's defeat, his improvement in skill is noteworthy. In the first set, Squires scored one game each at 2-1 and 3-2. In the second set, Qiu relaxed for one game after winning five consecutive games. The third set ended with a shutout.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhaojia Loses to Carlsen</h3>
<p>In the second singles match, Zheng Zhaojia was defeated by Carlsen, with a score of 3-1 as follows:</p>
<p>Carlsen (USA) Four to Six Six to One Six to Two Six to Three Zheng Zhaojia (China)</p>
<p>Carlsen's skills are indeed above those of young Zheng. Whether it is serving, net play, half-volley, or lob shots, Carlsen is better and more confident than young Zheng. In addition, Carlsen's physical strength is also superior to Zheng. Young Zheng was consistently mediocre and lifeless yesterday. Except for the first set, he succumbed to Carlsen's racket in the second and third sets, unable to rally at all. Carlsen's lobs and volleys left young Zheng helpless. At crucial moments, he often sent the ball into the net himself. It is difficult to win by holding the baseline and waiting for the opponent to defeat himself. At the beginning of the fourth set, young Zheng tried to fight back, repeatedly trying to net play, but after 3-1, he fell into decline again. Carlsen won five consecutive games and won the match.</p>

<h3>Municipal Party Asks City Government to Build Swimming Pool in Nanshi</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party believes that promoting physical education is the top priority for strengthening the nation, and swimming is even more urgently needed. However, the city has a population of over three million, and there is still no municipal swimming pool. Now that the city government will build a large-scale sports ground in the city center, it is necessary to build a swimming pool in Nanshi, so that residents of Shanghai South can swim at any time. In addition, the Party Department of the First District submitted the same request, so it specifically sent a letter to the municipal government for investigation and handling. The original letter is recorded below: "To the Shanghai Municipal Government, according to the report from the Executive Committee of the First District of the Association, swimming is one of the physical exercises, which can not only forge a strong body and promote human health, but also improve self-cultivation, eliminate bad habits, and strengthen the race. Therefore, in recent years, the superiors have advocated encouragement and tried their best to guide, and the inferiors have risen up and gathered to participate, hoping to be strong citizens and wash away the shame of the sick man. It is found that the South District of this city has a vast area and a large population, and culture is developed. There is only one public sports venue, the Ximen Dajilu Public Sports Ground. The terrain of the field is insufficient, and the equipment is lacking, especially the failure to set up a swimming pool is regrettable. As a result, most swimmers have to go to other places, such as various concessions, which are under the jurisdiction of others, and the ticket fees are outflowed. If it is Gaohai Bridge Beach, it is too far away, the road is long and expensive. Those belonging to private individuals are mostly simple and dangerous. It is recently heard that the authorities intend to open a large-scale sports ground in the city center, including swimming, etc. The scope is wide, the project is complicated, and the date of establishment is far away, and the traffic is inconvenient. In order to facilitate the public in the South City, it is recommended that the authorities build a public swimming pool in the South City to meet the needs of the citizens. The Association has learned from this and submitted the matter to the superiors for transfer to the municipal government for approval at the 88th Standing Committee meeting. It is reasonable to record the case and submit it to your association for review and approval, and immediately transfer it to the municipal government for planning, so as to benefit the people and advocate sports. I beg you to follow it, which is for the public convenience. According to this, the corresponding letter is sent to you for investigation and handling. Sincerely yours, Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>

<h3>The Gold Market's Financial Power Shifted From Short to Long, Spot Gold Initially Weak Then Firm</h3>
<p>English Gold Continued to Fall, Down Another One Yuan Three</p>
<p>The number of chips increased to 41,517</p>
<p>The gold market has been falling for days, and the trend is difficult to reverse. With the British side intermittently devaluing the pound, the exchange market in this city has been loose and excessive, so that the market opened with selling again yesterday, breaking through the 40 yuan mark. Later, because the banks still wanted more and the financial powers worked hard to increase their position, the buying interest was excited and inspired people. After the initial decline, the market rose, and the bank's selling interest was not strong, which helped the rise a lot. It was found that at the beginning of the morning, the London gold market rose by eight and a half pence, and the exchange rate continued to decline, falling to less than five yuan per pound. After the US bank closed, people followed London, so although the exchange rate shrank, it was not affected, but worried about the inevitable rise in large bars. US cotton rose 16 pounds, US wheat shrank by one cent, and the stock market rose and fell slightly. People's hearts were extremely depressed. Many overnight sellers closed their positions. The price of goods opened at 40 yuan and then fell slightly. The gold industry's preliminary trading also fell, and some buyers entered at a low price, struggling around 42 yuan. After the opening, due to the news that the US Treasury Department would issue 10 million yuan of silver coins every week, the buying price of banks was surprisingly cheap under the throwing of Chinese merchants, and the selling wind suddenly increased, and retreated to within the 40 yuan mark. Although there was a lot of struggle due to bank closing, after knowing the news that HSBC listed English gold up 375 and American gold up 625, the exchange market was looser than usual, and the sellers were very high-spirited and fell again. The financial powers fell to cover short positions, and then returned after the decline, but still struggled. The domestic market in banks was vague, and then tightened again. Although there were many sellers, most of them were floating, and gradually rose to outside 40 yuan, and there were many people who took the opportunity to buy. The buyers were able to show up temporarily. Jardine Matheson's private telegram said that the London bank buyers have recently been mostly speculators, and it is still unclear whether the actual purchase is by the real US government, and it is feared that it will be difficult to persist, and the supply from China is extremely small. In general, people are afraid of a large pullback, and that the bank's position should not be strong if there is not much supply from China, and the exchange rate should be expected to tighten. The financial powers bought fiercely, turning from short to long. After the Chinese merchants sold, they bought again. The banks really lacked selling interest, and the exchange market tightened again, and the gold market rose in a spin. At noon, the US Treasury Department will use new bonds to exchange for maturing bonds. The rumor was that the US bank faction intended to ask for a silver price of more than 50.01 cents. After the high, it fell slightly. In the morning, people's hearts were initially tired and then smart. Large bars were close to 22 pence, so it was appropriate to have a reaction. Recently, the weather has turned cooler. Starting next week, the afternoon business hours of the Gold Exchange will return to the old look, from 2:00 to 4:30. Now, the market situation in the morning is recorded.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 942 yuan and 2 jiao, down 3 yuan and 2 jiao from the previous close. The opening price of goods was 2 yuan and 50 cents. The exchange market opened in the morning with a recent selling price of 1 shilling and 4 and 1875 pence for English gold and 35 yuan and 75 cents for American gold. Although Fuxing Yongfuchang rose to 2 yuan and 8 jiao, due to the loose exchange market, there were few buyers for December US gold at 36 yuan. Hongxing Jiatai Yuqing Yongrichang Yuanmao Yongyuan Yicheng Tianfeng Yong and others sold frantically, breaking through the 40 yuan mark, and falling to 38 yuan and 3 jiao. HSBC bought December US gold at 0625, and Hengyu Fuyu Dadecheng rose to outside 40 yuan, but people's hearts were depressed. Knowing the news that HSBC listed English gold up 375 and American gold up 625, there were still many sellers. Yifeng Yongding sold to 8 yuan, and Yuqing Yongdachang Xiang Fuxing Yongxiang He Yuanmao Yong Hengtai rose to 9 yuan and 5 jiao, but it was said that someone sold 125 December US gold. Fuyu Yuanmao Yongding Kang Tongchun Yongli all sold, and the buyers had no prestige at all, and it fell to 37 yuan and 4 jiao. December English gold has loosened to 315. Yifeng Yong Yuqing Yong Fuxing Yongxiang He Yuanmao Yong and others bought at a low price, and Yicheng tried to sell a lot. Although it rose, it was still spinning. When Huixiang Yifeng Yong Yuanmao Yong Yuqing Yong Hengchang Yongdafa Yongding Dingkang Yicheng all advanced, the financial powers had already covered short positions from other numbers, and then broke through outside 40 yuan. At this time, Qianchang Xiang Fuxing Yong Dadecheng Dafa Yong still had supply, and once struggled around 40 yuan. Afterwards, the bank's appetite was still pulling, and there was a lack of selling positions. In addition, Dingkang Yuanmao Yong Chunyuan Yong Yingfeng Heng all advanced. Citibank pulled 9375 December US gold, and Hengxing went to the market to buy, and rose to 42 yuan and 9 jiao. Although it fell by one yuan due to retail sales, the financial powers bought fiercely again and again. Fuyu Dalian Gang Yuanmao Yong Fuxing Yong Chunyuan Yong and others also came to buy, and rose to 4 yuan. Dadecheng Fuyu Bingxing took advantage of the high supply and dropped to 2 yuan and 6 jiao. Citibank closed December US gold at 35 yuan and 875. Dadecheng fiercely entered the bar on behalf of the financial powers, and Hengxing Yuan Yi also paid, and rose to 4 yuan and 7 jiao. HSBC Citibank came out with 1875 shillings in November, and Dalian Gang Tianfeng Shenkang took advantage of the high to sell, and then fell to 2 yuan and 7 jiao. Daxing Yong Zhaofeng Chang Hengyu Dadecheng still came to buy continuously, and the sellers converged. After entering, it rose to 5 yuan and 2 jiao again. Shenkang Zhengchang Hengxing sold one after another, and then fell to 3 yuan and 8 jiao. It is good that the business is only half a day today, and the general floating is also sold. The noon closing was 944 yuan and 1 jiao, and the goods were sold for 4 yuan. After the market closed, Yongfeng Hengtai Dingkang Fuxing Yong all sold and were slightly tired. It was found that the highest price in half a day was 945 yuan and 2 jiao, and the lowest price was 937 yuan and 4 jiao, totaling 7 yuan and 8 jiao up and down. As a result, it was still 1 yuan and 3 jiao lower than the previous close.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that HSBC Bank's US gold listing rose by 625, the closing price was 35 yuan and 125, which is equivalent to a gold price of 978 yuan. According to the closing price, it is about 34 yuan, which is more than 16 yuan less than the previous closing price. The registered price for this month is 945 yuan, and for October it is 944 yuan. The supplementary water in the morning was 945 yuan, and the red gold price was 954 yuan and 2 jiao. The spot sales in the market were sluggish, because the spot gold suddenly rose and fell, and the ups and downs were huge, so the customers did not dare to easily put down their hands, because the risk was too great, so there was a lack of transactions. The spot of 993 fineness is about 15 yuan higher, and the futures are higher. The way out is not active, and the spot needs to be discounted, so the forward is more expensive than the recent.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was chaotic. Although the sellers were brave, most of them were floating. In summary, Dadecheng Hengxing Yuanmao Yong Yuqing Yong Fuchang Fuyu Dachang Xiang Hengyu Xianghe Yongfeng Zhaofeng Chang Hongkang Yong Tongfeng Heng Futai Heng Dingkang Sheng Dashunli Wanxing and others were on the buying side. Yicheng Yuanchang Yongdafa Yong Tongchun Hengtai Yiyu Qianchang Xiang Ruikang Fuxing Yong Shenkang Senchang Yong Huixiang Dingtai Chunyuan Yong Fu'an Yuanxing Yong Tongtai Chang Tianfeng Yong Richang Yongli and others were on the selling side. Dadecheng Dingkang Yifeng Yong Zhengchang Yong first came out and then entered, Hengtai Shuide Tianfeng advanced and then exited. Dalian Gang Wanxing made a total of more than 1,200 bars, advanced more than 400 bars, Shunli made a total of more than 1,500 bars, advanced more than 400 bars, the financial powers paid a total of more than 300 bars, Hengxing entered more than 1,500 bars, and exited more than 100 bars. The total number of transactions on that day was 69,216.</p>
<p>There are few remaining coupons in September. On the buying side, Fuyu Yifeng Yong each have more than 200, and Huiyuan Dadecheng each have more than 100. On the selling side, Fuchang has more than 400, Hengyu has more than 300, and Dafeng Heng has more than 100. The total number of remaining coupons is 903, totaling eight bulls and four shorts.</p>
<p>The lineup for October: On the bull side, Yifeng Yong has more than 5,900, Wanxing has more than 5,200, Shunli has more than 4,000, Fuchang Hengyu each have more than 3,000, Dadecheng has more than 2,800, Fuxing Yong has more than 1,800, Shunmao has more than 1,400, Yuanheng Daxing Yong has more than 1,200, Runchang Yu has more than 1,100, Tongfeng Heng has more than 1,000, Dachang Xiang has more than 900, Dingkang Qiafeng Yong each have more than 700, Dashun Yuansheng Hengxing each have more than 600, Qingfa Yong Yongli each have more than 500, Tianfeng Runchang Yong Changsheng Yong each have more than 400, Shen Yu Yingxiang each have more than 300.

<h3>English Gold Continued to Be Cheap, The English Exchange Rate Continued to Show a Strong Trend</h3>
<p>| HSBC Listed English Gold Up 375, American Gold Up 625 |</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegrams, London Large Bars rose by nearly 1875, and the far end rose by 25. The US bank did not move, and London raw gold rose by another eight and a half pence, causing English gold to shrink by three points against American gold, American gold to shrink by two points and two and a half points against English gold, English gold to fall by 43 pounds against French gold, and American gold to rise by 25 against French gold. The exchange market opened in the morning with a recent selling price of 1 shilling, 5 and 1875 pence for English gold and 35 yuan and 75 cents for American gold, which is 125 lower for both English and American gold compared to the previous close. Although the banks bought after the opening, the Chinese merchants' selling intention was very strong, so it continued to harden. HSBC's listing was announced, with English gold up 375 and American gold up 625. People's hearts suddenly weakened, and the bank's buying price was surprisingly cheap, and there were still sellers. The process was loose and excessive, and the general trend was vague, so the gold market rose after the financial powers bought it strongly, and the exchange market also gradually tightened due to bank closing. The Chinese merchants bought again after selling, and the shilling was in good shape, because the banks had no large amount of supply. The noon closing price for recent selling was 1 shilling, 5 and 125 pence for English gold and 35 yuan and 625 for American gold, which is 0625 lower for English gold and flat for American gold compared to the previous close. The Chinese merchants continued to sell short, but the shilling was initially blocked and then bought. More than 500,000 American gold was sold, and the bank's appetite was greater than selling. Now, the half-day transaction record is recorded.</p>
<p>The morning opening price for English gold was 1 shilling, 5 and 1875 pence. Shanghai Meifeng East Asia pulled 3125 in December, Citibank pulled the same price in November, and sold 25 in October. Overseas Chinese Mitsui pulled 3125 in December, Hua Bi came out with 25 in October, Youli came out with 1875 in October, Citibank sold 25 in December, Hua Bi Dongfang HSBC sold 1875 in November, and the closing selling price ranged from 1 shilling, 5 and 125 pence to 1875 pence, and the buying price was 0625 higher.</p>

<h3>Finance After Silver Export</h3>
<p>Once Demand Increases Slightly: Immediate Tension</p>
<p>Since the export of silver, the financial reserves of our country have been deeply depleted. Previously, due to the decline in silver prices in the United States, the outflow was temporarily halted. However, there has been no fundamental solution. Currently, overseas silver prices have rebounded, and speculators have begun to operate again. Given the stagnation of our country's industry and the resulting trade deficit, it is inevitable that this situation cannot be salvaged. With the arrival of autumn, goods are gradually entering the market, and foreign exchange usage is increasing, causing renewed tension in the market. The overnight foreign exchange rate in the market has suddenly increased by half compared to the previous day, with both morning and afternoon rates at 15%, an increase of 5%. The rate for "hua tou jia shui" (speculative currency transactions) has doubled, from 3% the previous day to 9% yesterday, indicating the panic among the people. In the morning session, over 4.3 million in transfer and new transactions were done; in the afternoon session, over 200,000. Transactions in the Small General Association were over 400,000. For foreign exchange collateral transactions, redemptions and new transactions totaled over 2.1 million. In terms of collections, foreign banks collected over 2.0 million in bills, over 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlements, over 1.4 million in supplementary settlements, and over 2.8 million in various goods, exchange collateral, and miscellaneous collections. Outward warehouse shipments amounted to 400,000. Chinese banks collected over 3.1 million in bills, over 700,000 in foreign exchange settlements, over 1.2 million in supplementary settlements, over 500,000 in customs duties, and over 3.7 million in various exchange goods, collateral, and miscellaneous collections. Inward warehouse shipments amounted to 300,000. Japanese banks collected over 2.1 million in bills, over 900,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and over 4.3 million in various exchange goods, collateral, and miscellaneous collections. Outward warehouse shipments amounted to 400,000. Qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks) collected over 34 million in foreign public notes, over 4.7 million in "hua tou" money, over 2.0 million in banknote withdrawals and issuances, 670,000 in cash receipts, over 700,000 in remittances from various routes, 150,000 from Anlu, and 400,000 from Qu Wei.</p>
<p>The total exchange volume of the Shanghai Clearing House on September 1st was 22,265,664.88 silver dollars, including 17,197,741.01 silver dollars and 5,067,923.87 silver dollars in exchange drafts.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Silver Steady, Guangdong Silver Slightly Better</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangsu small silver was at 835.5 yuan for both the morning and afternoon sessions, the same as the previous day. Traded volume was 5,000 jiao in the morning session and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Guangdong small silver was slightly better by one yuan compared to the previous day, with the morning session at 740.05 yuan and the afternoon session at 740.07 yuan. Traded volume was 55,000 jiao in the morning session and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins remained at 328.5 per 1,000 cash, with a transaction price of 9,200 yuan in silver, equivalent to 30,222 strings of cash.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Remain Weak</h3>
<p>Continuing to Fall 45 to 90 Cents</p>
<p>Only the 23rd Customs Remains Good, Up 35 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to the sudden increase in the overnight foreign exchange rate to 15%, people became nervous again, and bulls were extremely panicked. The selling pressure was so strong as if people feared they couldn't get rid of their holdings. Such is the state of a weakened morale. In reality, they are just seeing ghosts in the shadows, frightening themselves. Also, the excessive amount of margin accounts means that with more transactions, the fluctuations become greater. The supply of public debt fluctuates, depending on the sentiments of the people. The current situation is one of alarm, with short sellers being very active. However, with too many short sellers, it is easy to trigger a rally. The reporter has said this before, but fears that this is not yet a truly good sign. Yesterday's events saw the 17th public bond coming out during the opening, with the 5th, 11th, and 38th also selling. Prices uniformly fell by 45 cents to 1.34 yuan. In the second session, only the "bian qian" (disbandment) bonds slightly recovered by 23 cents, while the rest failed to restore the weakened morale and showed no signs of a turnaround, continuing to fall by 34 cents to 67 cents. At closing, the "bian qian" bonds slightly fell by 34 cents, while the rest saw short covering gradually rise, causing a sudden rally, uniformly rising by 34 cents to over one yuan. This kind of sudden rise and fall is only temporary and should not be considered a firm upward trend. If the overnight foreign exchange rate can shrink, then there may be a possibility of continued gains. The market result was a continued drop of 45 cents to 90 cents, with only the 23rd customs bond rising by 35 cents. The situation is still chaotic. The total turnover was about 35 million. The details are omitted. Here is a comparative table of the gains and losses (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Silver Mining Stocks Recover</h3>
<p>Newfeng Foreign Firm reported yesterday (31st) that trading on the New York stock market was exceptionally quiet, with a narrow range of fluctuations throughout the day. Later, near the close, silver mining stocks recovered, causing the market to prosper. The recovery of silver mining stocks may be due to the Treasury's declaration indicating that silver coin issuance will increase. Various stocks on the small exchange fell slightly. The bond market fell sharply due to the weakness of government securities, railroad bonds, and German debt. Today's private estimate of U.S. production, although favorable to the bullish side, saw Chicago wheat fall due to weakness in Canada. The weakness in Canada is due to the successful harvest in the country's northwest. The total daily trading volume was 400,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Cotton Yarn Sales Scarce, Further Declines</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak again, with a clear trend of increasing difficulties. The sluggish sales of spot yarn and the tight credit conditions are further impacting yarn sales. Although Japanese merchants are covering near-term short positions with far-term sales, it is still difficult to curb the speculative trend. The cotton market is still high, making it even more difficult for factories.</p>
<p>(Golden Rooster Continues to Fall Yuan Xu) The pre-market opening for standard yarn showed a slight rise in U.S. cotton. After many days of declines, there was hope for a rally. However, most people in the market were waiting to sell on the rally, which weakened the upward momentum. Therefore, the market remained weak. As a result, various months fell by 1, 2, 4, and 5 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn sales had turned cold again, with only about 300 bales sold throughout the day. Factory representatives were very loose-lipped, which increased the selling pressure. Also, the prices of flour and wheat plummeted, further weakening sentiment. As a result, various months fell by another 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 cents. The total daily transaction volume was 31,000 bales. Sales included 1,000 bales of Jifeng, 850 bales of Changyu, 1,300 bales of Renfeng, 600 bales of Yuan Yi, 650 bales of Sui Da, 1,700 bales of Mingde, and 800 bales of Huikang. Purchases included 450 bales of Tongfu, 1,600 bales of Dafeng, 600 bales of Junchang, 1,150 bales of Changfeng, 900 bales of Dachang, 1,100 bales of Hengde, 1,000 bales of Runkang, and 600 bales of Xiesheng. The daily high, low, and closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>February 183.5 182.6 182.6 || ||</p>
<p>Total 282,200</p>
<p>(Yarn Sales Turn Sluggish Again) Spot yarn sales have turned sluggish again. Statistics show that only 343 bales were purchased by various "bangs" (merchant groups) throughout the day. Prices are weakening. The purchase volume of each "bang" is as follows:</p>
<p>North Bang 10 Guangdong 70 Yunnan 10 Shantou 10 Mainland 160 Nanyang 75 Xiamen 1 Fellow Traders 5 Ningbo 2</p>
<h3>Standard Cotton Market Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly weak, but the market condition is harder than the yarn market. The "huoji" bang and some cotton merchants are bullish, and Dafu made profits and heavily covered short positions, which tightened the market price. However, the weather has turned sunny, making the cotton fiber particularly good, which is favorable to short sellers. As for the factories, they view the yarn market as poor, so they purchase very little spot cotton.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Dafu Covers Short Positions) The pre-market opening for standard cotton saw the weather turn sunny. Although U.S. cotton rose by several pounds, the sentiment in the market was flat. Various months fell by 5 cents to 1.2 cents. After the second and third rounds of trading, bulls became active and rose by another 10 cents. The closing price declined again due to the poor yarn market. As a result, various months fell by 5 cents to 1.5 cents. The afternoon opening was also soft, but the bulls still had no intention of letting go. The market condition was still firm. However, most people in the market believed that the sharp fall in flour and wheat prices was closely related to cotton prices. The total daily transaction volume was 74,400 dan. Sales included 2,100 dan of Tongji, 2,300 dan of Shenji, 1,500 dan of Renfeng, 1,500 dan of Yuantai, 2,300 dan of Xiesheng, 3,100 dan of Huikang, 1,000 dan of Shenchang, 2,500 dan of Senkang, and 1,500 dan of Yifeng. Purchases included 3,700 dan of Dafu, 1,200 dan of Mingde, 1,500 dan of Shenchang, 1,600 dan of Taichang, 1,100 dan of Yichang, 4,100 dan of Changfeng, 5,400 dan of Runkang, 1,900 dan of Yuanxingchang, and 1,300 dan of Jinchang.

<p>(Demand for Raw Cotton Flat) Spot cotton sales are flat, and factory demand is dim. Sources include 850 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Haiti Jian 39.25 Shenxin Factory purchased 600 bales of spot goods for factory delivery. Huoji cotton 38.75 Shenxin Factory purchased 1,600 bales of spot goods for factory delivery. Yuyao cotton 38.00 Zhenxin Factory purchased 800 bales for September delivery in Wuxi.</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Sees Slight Recovery</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially weak due to selling pressure and sluggish cloth sales. Later, it recovered due to buying by fellow traders. As a result, spot goods rose by 15 points, and futures rose by 2 to 10 points. English cotton futures fell by 1 point. Indian cotton was initially firm due to buying by speculators, but slightly softened due to some profit-taking. As a result, Pingguoer and Aomula rose by 7.5 jiao, and Bailuoxi rose by 1 rupee.

<h3>Last Week's U.S. Cotton Market Quiet</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on August 31st reported on the cotton market for the week, stating: "The cotton market this week was relatively quiet. Any activity from either buyers or sellers would cause the market to react. At the beginning of the week, reports of high spot basis prices in the Southwest and scattered demand from fellow traders were factors maintaining the market condition. However, when the December contract reached 13.5 cents, selling increased, and the market price loosened. After the bulls closed out their positions, there was also some hedging selling in the South. The development of textile worker strikes, uncertainty about the next agricultural department report, and unsettling fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have limited the business of general merchants in the middle of the week. They are increasingly seeking to balance their transactions and wait for an opportunity. The strength of the basis prices in the Southwest is due to the fulfillment of contracts at the end of August and the beginning of September. Most of the new cotton shipments this week are destined for the Far East. The listing of new cotton is slightly delayed due to unfavorable weather. At the same time, merchants are unwilling to rush to sell due to strike news. Everyone believes that the limited demand from domestic cotton mills will lead to selling pressure, but government loans can protect it and prevent it from falling sharply."</p>

<h3>Grains and Flour Plunge Sharply</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months plummeted sharply. Although the quoted price for foreign wheat in Chicago was only about 3 cents, and Canadian wheat was better by 48 cents, the sentiment in the market and among those inside and outside the industry changed dramatically. The large amount of goods delivered in previous months had no inquiries for actual sales and were completely taken away by hedging accounts. The recent sluggishness of actual sales is due to the lack of purchasing power in rural areas, resulting in unusually sluggish intake. In addition, factory production has not decreased, leading to an increasing accumulation of goods. Therefore, after the opening price, the market saw a large decline. Major factories again took advantage of the situation and aggressively sold, causing near-term and far-term prices to fall sharply by 5 to 7 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, the sentiment remained weak. Because of rain in various places in the inland areas, the inland merchants were also soft in their sentiment and sold off large quantities in various months. In addition, Amai's price was only 5.46 yuan, so the decline continued by another 2 to 3 cents in the middle of the session. However, towards the closing, the market slightly improved due to short covering. But given the current situation, due to the limited actual sales and the approaching foreign wheat prices, there is a general feeling that the previous sharp rise is unlikely to be repeated. As a result, this month fell by 8.25 cents compared to the end-of-month closing price, October fell by 9 cents, November fell by 9.25 cents, December fell by 9 cents, January fell by 8.5 cents, and February opened at 5.90 yuan and closed down by 4.75 cents.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, prices for all months fell sharply. Although the quoted price for foreign wheat in Chicago was only about 3 cents, and Canadian wheat was better by 48 cents, since the actual sales of flour have stopped, the consumption of wheat has also declined. The factories, after accumulating large amounts of flour and wheat, are taking a wait-and-see approach and do not want to compete. The market participants have long recognized that this situation is bound to fall, so when the opening price was set, this month was still as high as 8 jiao, but then the buyers sold off vigorously, and the price continued to decline. Later, affected by the loosening of flour prices, the price fell again. By the time of the closing, the price had fallen more than 1 jiao across the board. Looking back, the difference between the highest market value in August and the current value has reached 9 jiao, showing that an irrational rise must be subject to the same reaction. As a result, this month plummeted by 1 jiao and 8 fen, October fell by 1 jiao and 9 fen, November fell by 1 jiao and 8 fen, December fell by 1 jiao and 6 fen, and January fell by 1 jiao and 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Foreign "Xian" Rice Continues to Fall 1-2 Jiao</h3>
<p>|客幫内地完全停辦|</p>
<p>The market conditions for foreign "xian" rice yesterday saw a complete halt to inland operations by the "ke" merchant groups. The demand in this street was also weak. The hoarders only engaged in futures trading, and there was even a return of spot goods. The market softened immediately at the opening. The Yangtze River area also received rain, and the sources gradually increased. The autumn crops were excellent after the rain in the inland areas, which stabilized the sentiment. The early rice had been mostly harvested. For the time being, there was still rice stored from previous operations, so there was no need to transport and operate again. The market had a large amount of inventory, but little consumption, so the market price had to fall by 1-2 jiao. Fortunately, the hoarders were reluctant to sell after the small price drop, and this street bought on the dip, so the market was able to stabilize. In the overall market, 2,500 bags of various "ke xian" rice were opened, with 700 bags of spot foreign rice and 200 tons of futures. The stocks of small-grain and Annam japonica rice were small, and the market price was able to stabilize. The sources of "ke xian" rice gradually increased, and the price gradually decreased. In the futures market, many hoarders returned the stocks, with September Saigon at only 5.23 yuan and October at 5.3 yuan, a decrease of 1 jiao compared to the end of the previous month.</p>
<h3>Du Yang Jian New Price Sees Reduction</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various "bangs" were still only the 10th, with a total of 1,400 to 1,500 "shi." The market condition was softer due to the weather turning sunny after the rain, so those speculating on high prices stood still. However, the medium-grade goods had already seen a reduction of several "fen." As for Du Yang Jian, except for the old goods that were unaffected, the new goods, due to the limited outlets, saw a sharp reduction of 2-3 jiao. There was no change in the overcast situation. As for the new "geng" rice, which was in short supply, there was no change. The factory in Dongxin still opened at 11.6 yuan.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various routes in Hexia were the 15th and 16th. The digestion of various goods in the market was normal for "bai geng" (white japonica), and the trading of early "bo dao" (thin rice) and new "ke jian" (guest sharp) was sluggish. Yang Du Jian traded slightly. The market prices of "bai geng," "bai yuan zao bo dao," and "Dongxin geng" were stable, while Yang Du Jian, new and old "ke jian" were weak.</p>
<h3>Main Reasons for Rising Asphalt Prices</h3>
<p>Asphalt is suitable for autumn sales, and various places are purchasing from Hankou to meet the needs of the "tao" households. The inventory in Hankou is not large, and due to the hot weather, the goods from various production areas cannot be shipped, so the sources in Hankou cannot be gathered. The producers have not arrived in Hankou, so although the purchasers have needs, the sellers are few and far between. Recently, the price of Macheng oil has soared to 15.5 yuan, but this is not the actual market price. Because Taifeng is a guest goods, and the guest merchants have not arrived, the traders dare not specialize and deliberately raise the price to discourage the purchasers. It is likely that the formal market price will only be available after the autumn weather cools and the guest goods gather, and the guest merchants arrive. Heavy Jing is at 15.2-3 yuan per "ju," and Ping Jing is at 14.7-8 yuan. There are not many transactions either. The general situation is similar to Macheng. The Zhe asphalt is because the weather in the Jiaxing area is dry, and the harvest is greatly reduced. According to the tree heads, only 20-30% can be harvested in the future, so the Heben oil has soared to 22 yuan per "dan." Although the local traders are still purchasing from Hankou, the quantity is not large. Because the drought in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is so severe, the autumn and winter sales are bound to be greatly reduced, so they are unwilling to prepare too much. The selling price has gradually increased, with heavy Jing at 19 yuan per "ju," Ping Jing at 18.4 yuan, and Macheng oil at 17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Peanut and Soybean Oil Weakening</h3>
<p>The market conditions for peanut oil and soybean oil are in a state of increasing weakness. Yesterday, the market only opened for 450 pieces of peanut oil, including 50 pieces of Bo'er oil at a price of 11.6 yuan and 400 pieces of Juecang oil at a price of 11.4 yuan. The price was 6 jiao lower than the previous market. The stagnation of the oil market is due to the drought and cracking of inland river channels, making boat transportation impossible. There is no one asking about the outlets. It can only rely on the gradual sales on this street, so it is feared that the market atmosphere will not be easy to wake up for a while. At present, the bottom stock of soybean oil is increasing, estimated at more than 10,000 large and small pieces. The inventory of peanut oil is more than 1,000 pieces.</p>
<h3>High Demand for Black and Purple Lamb's Wool, Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of woolen fabrics was brisk, both wholesale and retail. The standard market price remained the same as the previous day. The most popular item was black and purple lamb's wool. Because the inventory in the market was very short, the Sichuan merchant groups were actively searching for and operating on it, and the selling price soared. The yellow, black, and purple lamb's wool, which sold for about 6 yuan last year, has now soared to over 7 yuan, with the top-grade wool at 9.25 yuan. The popularity of the market can be said to be the best among the recent woolen fabrics. However, there is not much trading of the 9-yuan-plus top-grade goods on this street, because the buyers are mostly hesitant due to the high price, while the second-grade goods are in short supply and almost out of stock.</p>
<h3>Competition in the Price of Hardware, English Galvanized Iron</h3>
<p>Cheaper Than Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Recently, the local galvanized iron market has been dominated by Japanese goods. This is because their prices are cheaper than those of English and American goods. Consequently, customers and construction workers are happy to trade with them, and exchange dealers find them easier to sell, so they negotiate with them more often. As a result, English goods have become unusually quiet in the market. American goods, on the other hand, can still manage due to their superior quality, so their prices have not been greatly affected. However, British manufacturers, seeing the unfavorable environment and the impact of Japanese goods, have had to compete by lowering prices. Therefore, their cheaper goods are expected to arrive in mid-month, totaling more than 20,000 sheets, with a price of about $1.123 per seven-foot sheet and about $0.923 per six-foot sheet. Looking at the arrival price of Japanese goods, the lowest is $1.256 (seven feet) and $1.034 (six feet), which is more than a dime cheaper per sheet. Therefore, the smooth sales of English goods in the future can be predicted.</p>

<p>Women's World</p>
<h3>Cool Autumn, September</h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>The unprecedented heat of more than sixty years made people "count the days until the west wind arrives" day after day. Now it's cool, and a rain brings the feeling of autumn.</p>
<p>This new autumn brings us some joy and some doubts.</p>
<p>Firstly: With the autumn coolness, women will no longer go barefoot and bare-legged, nor will they jump into bathing places with men. This way, public morals may be expected to change, saving officials in various places from worrying themselves sick.</p>
<p>Secondly: According to "Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals," "Spring's atmosphere is loving, summer's atmosphere is joyful, autumn's atmosphere is stern, and winter's atmosphere is sorrowful." In these chaotic times, men of ambition are dispirited and mostly indulge in love and pleasure. It is useless to use sorrowful thoughts to reverse this declining trend; only the solemn atmosphere of autumn is the most suitable remedy.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, early autumn is the time when new grains are harvested. Like this year, when Heaven has abandoned (?) our people, and floods and droughts occur together, how many farming families can pick up fallen rice ears? Who should first bear the brunt of this misfortune? Before the whole family, old and young, commits suicide by poisoning or hanging, they will inevitably sell their daughters, sell their daughters, sell their daughters. As a result, large cities, especially Shanghai, where Chinese and foreigners live together, will be filled with young prostitutes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the Northeast, since its fall on September 18, the suffering endured in the past three years and a thousand days can be described as profound. Now, the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun can no longer be seen. Imagining the women there, they are probably learning to sing the national anthem of the puppet state in a delicate voice, like Puyi's wife, while enduring shame and humiliation.</p>
<p>These internal and external sad situations call for every man and woman to step forward into society and train in various skills and abilities to save themselves and the country. Unexpectedly, just as a very few people were able to go out and support themselves, they encountered the prevailing idea that "women should return to the home"!</p>
<p>American aviator Miss White郎, because she couldn't find like-minded people here, quietly left China a few days ago. Our (women's) people, no matter where, are disappointing. Even if female thinkers, female educators, female revolutionaries, and female social workers from other countries come from afar, besides encountering pitiful or hateful prostitutes and modern types, what like-minded people can they find among our mothers and grandmothers?</p>
<p>Our people are destined to be submissive! All responsibilities of maintaining internal order, resisting external aggression, and issuing calls to charge are entrusted to a few superiors. What kind of national front formation is this?</p>
<p>Cool autumn, September, the cries of geese fill the fields, and in addition to hunger and thirst, there will be the oppression of cold. Cool autumn, September, the enemy's newly fattened warhorses will gallop into our fields. But our people are submitting to the current, submitting to the incompetent position of not hearing or asking about matters outside the home: unwilling to exhaust the functions of four hundred million people, lining up to save the four hundred million people's nation. This is how wasteful and ignorant it is here!</p>
<h3>I Also Want to Talk About the "Good Wife, Wise Mother" System</h3>
<p>— Li Hu</p>
<p>I cannot agree with the points that Ms. Yun Qi criticized in the previous "Good Wife, Wise Mother" system article. I hereby refute them:</p>
<p>The lady condemned this system as "a product of medieval feudal society, a tool used by men to restrict women to be instruments of their one-sided sexual desire, the most cunning means used by men to confine women into domestic slaves, and anyone who praises the good wife and wise mother system is reversing history."</p>
<p>On this point, the lady first committed the error of misinterpreting the four words "good wife, wise mother" and not recognizing the times. This "good wife, wise mother" system is indeed a product of medieval feudal society, and at that time, there were indeed such prejudiced and erroneous ideas. However, the lady does not know that history is advancing, and the emergence of any system is tied to relevant social background and timing; that is, it must adapt to the needs of the social environment in order to be promoted and supported by people. Therefore, its interpretation often changes with time and circumstance. The lady did not recognize that the current social environment does not require the adoption of this system, nor did she investigate what the true essence of the meaning of these four words "good wife, wise mother" is, and subjectively blindly misinterpreted them, leading to a deep and bitter hatred of this system. This is forgetting temporality and reversing history.</p>
<p>This "good wife, wise mother" system, according to modern interpretation, its true essence of meaning, I believe, is: a wise mother is one who teaches her children well, and a good wife is one who supports her husband's interests. She does bear the responsibility for all the trivial matters of the family, as well as the birth and education of children. However, it does not mean absolute obedience, hard work without complaint, and unwavering dedication until death. So, let's first examine whether the current social environment needs this "good wife, wise mother" system, which is also its true essence of meaning. Whether it is suitable for modernity.</p>
<p>Looking at the current social environment, most of the women who have been liberated and demand equal rights with men in all aspects are not large consumers of men's economic income, and most of them entrust their children to nannies and adopt a laissez-faire, uncaring attitude. Those who want to break the shackles of people and conform to the true essence of the meaning of "good wife, wise mother" are rare. May I ask if there is a more virulent consequence of liberation than this!</p>
<p>The "good wife, wise mother" system that is actually adopted, a wise mother, should take the obligation of teaching her children well as the goal, and urge them to make progress; a good wife should take the interests of the family as the premise, and cooperate, support, and strive together as the will. In the future, children and family will be the pillars and backbone of the country. A wise mother should take diligent teaching and patient guidance as her duty; a good wife should take assisting her husband and increasing the interests of the family as her principle. This is in line with the needs of a society like our country, which is poor, weak, and disorganized. It is not taking the three obediences and four virtues as the goal. If so, liberation and equality are complete, and rights and management are shared. Some achievements that have been achieved in long-term struggles (such as the right to freedom of marriage, the right to inheritance, the right to vote::) are not only not returned, but are also deeply rooted. So, what Ms. Yun Qi said: "Anyone who advocates restoring the good wife and wise mother system is actually advocating restoring the family system of the medieval feudal era and all the tools attached to it that oppress women." It is definitely an inaccurate, and even an empty statement.</p>
<p>As for the peasant families in our country's rural areas, under the cruel exploitation and oppression of capitalists, and under long-term and continuous unemployment, because the wife goes out to work as a lady or a nanny, the whole family has been torn apart, and there is no talk of any "good wife, wise mother" system. I believe that women in rural families in our country, from the perspective of cultural standards, cannot talk about enjoying equal rights with men in all aspects of economy, politics, and culture, but the true essence of the meaning of the modern "good wife, wise mother" system is completely in line with it.</p>
<p>Isn't men plowing and women weaving an expression of cooperating, supporting, and striving together with the interests of the family as the premise? Not hiring a nanny,</p>
<p>Under such exploitation and oppression, unwilling to sit idly by and watch her husband and children starve to death, she would rather abandon her husband and children, go out to work as an employee, and do her best to help. Can this not be said to be the ultimate expression of a good wife and wise mother, but a domestic slave? Only in this way can everyone do their best, both liberated and equal.</p>
<p>From the above points, does this good wife and wise mother system violate objective facts, should it be protested against, are we turning back the clock in history instead of moving forward, and is it a policy of fooling the people? I am afraid that Ms. Yun Qi's argument will be crushed by the wheels of history!</p>
<h3>The Wives of the Soviet Union (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Written by Auna Louise Strong, Translated by Liang Qiu</p>
<p>Soviet women are not respected because they are wives; even the wives of important people are not respected because of their husbands. When Stalin's wife died, the newspaper's black-edged obituary wrote her own name and career, only incidentally saying that she was Stalin's companion and comrade. Kalinin's wife gained her reputation for creating national farms and cultural centers in the Altai Mountains. In the Soviet Union, marriage is happy, but it is not a source of career.</p>
<p>The future and reputation of Soviet women are not obtained because they are wives, but because they are citizens. Family affairs, which are almost a legitimate profession in the United States, are only insignificant things that are not worthy of respect in our eyes. Household chores are shared by husband and wife. As for color, art, and music, we use them to decorate public places, such as cultural parks, rest areas, theaters, and factory clubs.</p>
<p>Our living situation often makes the wives of American engineers or workers who come to the Soviet Union tired. When the men are working happily in the factory, their wives feel lonely and bored. Their honorable profession - arranging a happy family for their husbands - is not needed in the Soviet Union. In the factories where men serve, they are seen as obstacles. Once, a leader of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to me: "These women (referring to the wives of American engineers or workers) often come to the office to pester us. Just because their husbands are useful people, they think they are great people. What's so great about it? Even Stalin's wife is not great! Parasites, parasites who only consume and do not produce, how much do they hinder the time of valuable workers!" These women either eventually found a job and enjoyed it, or pulled their husbands back to the United States.</p>
<p>Although we do not have the honor of being a wife or a housekeeper, we enjoy all the rights of honor in working as citizens, just like men. Throughout the Soviet Union, women hold positions everywhere: wives are village chiefs, collective farm leaders, chamber of commerce chairpersons, factory directors, judges in courts, doctors, or engineers. There is simply no gender distinction in work; schools and universities accept female students. Women work the same as men in any profession and receive the same wages as men. Nearly a hundred women have received the Order of the Red Star, which is awarded to people with advanced military achievements in the Soviet Union. Many women have received civil honors, the Order of Lenin, and the Order of the Red Star. Six thousand women are leaders of collective farms, one hundred thousand are elected as court officials, and four hundred thousand are officials in local Soviets. Female students account for seventy-one and a quarter of the total number of students in medical schools, and it is expected that most of the future doctors will be women. Women have gone to the Arctic to explore. Alan Rozanova was the first female Arctic explorer. She spent a year in the icy and snowy world, sailing on the Abrikov icebreaker on two routes in Northeast and Northwest Asia. Some people encountered many Soviet female geographers at the top of the world. A woman gave birth to a son on the Chelyuskin icebreaker.</p>
<p>The women's independence movement, which is developing very slowly in various countries around the world, has developed rapidly in the Soviet Union due to the rapid development of industry.</p>
<p>丨Farmlands were combined into mechanized and industrialized collective farms in five years, where women worked the same as men and received compensation. Under the Soviet political system, the peasant women who finally felt that they had equal rights gradually realized the meaning of having an independent income.</p>
<p>Because of the creation of collective farms, thirty million peasant women from Leningrad to Vladivostok felt that they could live safely without a husband. The men's last fortress - an old-fashioned family, a male-centered, patriarchal family - has reached its end for the sake of women's equality and independence. This is probably what moralists in countries outside the Soviet Union are most heartbroken about.</p>
<h3>Parents' University and Wise Mother, Good Wife</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>Good and wise are both very good words, but it is suspicious to only say "wise mother, good wife" and not "good husband, wise father." It is even more suspicious to label it as an ideology and promote it. Is this what is called: "Confirming the principle of gender equality and promoting the development of women's rights"? I don't understand it. Ever since the slogan "Women return to the family" was put forward, the role and meaning of "Wise Mother, Good Wife Ideology" became clear. Okay, if you want to return to the family, then return to the family. But what are you going back to do? Farmers are bankrupt, and many workers have no home, so let's not talk about them. Speaking of those who have a home: "Ahem! Bring me a cup of tea!" "Bring me a cigarette丨light it!" Seems very arrogant, aren't you ashamed? Making beds, folding quilts, sweeping the courtyard, women can certainly do it, but men can also do it. Speaking of clothes: Western suits are certainly not something a good wife is familiar with, and Chinese-style clothes are still made by a tailor. Socks, cloth-made ones, have long been worn by no one. As for shoes, whether cloth or leather, they are all well-fitting products from shoe stores. And scarves, needless to say, there is no need to bother the wife丨good wife to worry about. Even small things like handkerchiefs, with new styles and many colors, are readily available on the market丨and they are cheap and of good quality. Speaking of eating: Rice, noodles, and food, as well as tea and snacks, anything slightly tasty has long been bought from the neighborhood. As for dishes, everything, no matter how wise the wife is, she can't compare to the chef. In an industrial society, restaurants, eateries, and lunch providers have simply replaced the family kitchen. The so-called "internal affairs" seems to be intentionally made empty by Father Time. Speaking of children's love: This is originally a universal human feeling, and it should be treated equally. If they also say: You should also stay at home with me all day long! Let's not do anything else! How would that work? It is impossible to be a good wife. Then, let's talk about wise mothers: Once a wife gives birth to a child, she gets the title of mother, and thus the husband becomes a father. Of course, the husband cannot raise children, but the husband's relationship to raising children is also very important. For example, if he doesn't know about physiology, hygiene, and hygiene, it will bring misfortune or disaster to the mother and child. After the child is born, they need to be raised and educated, which requires a wise mother. In fact, the guys who become fathers, besides not having milk, can not only do the tasks of a wise mother, but can also do them very well. Let's take the heavy task as an example: The most difficult thing in raising a child is dealing with children's illnesses. Taking Shanghai as an example, the best pediatricians are men, not women. Secondly, there is education. Not to mention the distant past, the German Troebel, who first created kindergartens, was not a woman. Even in terms of Chinese experts in child education, isn't Mr. Chen Heqin the first to be recommended? As for washing diapers, changing poop bags, and even hugging and teasing, it is not divided by gender, everyone can do it, it's just a matter of whether or not they do it. From this, it can be seen that a mother can be wise, not only can women do it, but men can especially do it. I think: Ten months of pregnancy, and then going through life and death during childbirth, women's maternal tasks can be considered the most difficult and greatest. After the child is born, let the man raise it, wouldn't that be very fair?</p>
<p>From the facts mentioned above, we know that: The so-called "housework" has been transformed into social industry due to human evolution and social progress. The responsibilities of women in the past have mostly become specialized knowledge. What was previously considered things that women should do, men can now do丨Things that were previously required of women (such as raising infants), men are now happy to do and do them very well. This is what the facts tell us: The era of good wives and wise mothers is over! There is nothing for women to do when they return to the family! For the sake of human happiness 丨especially for the children, we should have an education that is more suitable for modern times! This, in addition to universally implementing "human" education regardless of gender, we should run a "Parents' School!"</p>
<p>"Parents' University" was recently established in Soviet Russia (various newspapers published this news at the end of June, and Chen Xi of the Xinwen Chenbao also wrote an article about it), which has already attracted the attention of the Chinese people. Soviet Russia is a country that encourages women to go to society. It is said that more than one-third of the female students in their universities are female scientists with national credentials, totaling 7,000. More than 90 people are leaders of national scientific institutions! There are 20,000 registered cases of women making technical inventions! There are more women in health and education institutions. Women's participation in other agricultural, industrial, political, and police circles has long been known to us. This proves that it is completely a prejudice丨not in line with the facts that women are only suitable for managing the family and raising children. They丨Soviet Russia pay attention to children's happiness no less than other countries, at least not weaker than us. For the sake of public child care, they have universally established "nurseries." Then, creating a "Parents' University," as the name suggests, is undoubtedly thinking about their small citizens.</p>
<p>Using school education and scientific knowledge to teach people all the intelligence of being parents, so that every educated person can acquire specialized knowledge, whether in the family or in society. How can this be compared with the one-sided and unsuitable "Wise Mother, Good Wife Education" of the times? Therefore, I think that instead of blindly shouting about "Wise Mother, Good Wife" education, it is better to advocate running a "Parents' University."</p>
<h3>A Visit to Shanghai's First Nursery</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The children are unusually healthy</p>
<p>Family members can rest easy</p>
<p>Shanghai Children's Welfare Association's First Nursery has been open for several months, but I haven't had the chance to visit it due to being burdened by life. Recently, I took the opportunity to attend the Confucius Memorial Meeting and drove there. Walking into the reception room, Director Yang of the nursery greeted me with a beaming smile, waving a large palm-leaf fan. She looked at least fifty years old, but her energy was vaguely the same as a young person's.</p>
<p>After sitting down, we exchanged pleasantries as usual. Then, I hurriedly asked everything I wanted to know as much as possible.</p>
<p>According to Director Yang's sincere answer: "The organization of the nursery is very simple. The director is a volunteer. In addition, there is one clerk, one nanny director, one teaching assistant, six nurses, and four wet nurses: The nanny director and the teaching assistant are in charge of teaching, and the nurses are all from medical schools and are in charge of childcare.</p>
<p>"The total number of children in the nursery is sixty (half of whom are infants). They are divided into three groups for education and care. From birth to one year old is considered infants, one to three years old is toddlers, and three to six years old is kindergarten students (only one is six years old). The children's families are mostly from the academic community, followed by business, government, and military.</p>
<p>"In terms of economy, the monthly expenditure is 1,000 yuan, and the tuition income is only 400 yuan. Therefore, even though each child costs eight yuan, the nursery actually subsidizes a lot. First of all, the milk powder alone costs about 12 yuan per child on average.</p>
<p>"In terms of equipment, we have everything ordinary. The only shortcoming is that we don't have a garden."</p>
<p>At this point, I felt that the conversation was coming to an end, so I stood up and asked to visit the various rooms.</p>
<p>"Welcome!" Director Yang stood up before I finished speaking.</p>
<p>First, we visited the washroom, dining room, and classroom, which were all decorated very simply. Then, we stepped onto the stairs.</p>
<p>"Director Yang, recently there have been some rumors outside that the children have become thinner after coming here. Is that true?" I suddenly remembered a friend's casual remark and asked as we walked.</p>
<p>"Hmm!" Director Yang seemed a little surprised, but then she calmed down and said: "This can be said to be half rumor and half misunderstanding. For example, if you have a child and you change to a new wet nurse, wouldn't the child become thinner due to physical and milk reasons? So, even if there are sometimes one or two thinner children in our nursery, it is at most for this reason. Of course, I'm not saying that we're doing things perfectly, but in reality::? Oh, I can tell you that there is not a single thin child right now. Fortunately, the facts will prove it to you right away, you see."</p>
<p>At this moment, the children's bedroom was in front of us. Because it was nap time, all the children were sleeping peacefully.</p>
<p>The light in the room was very soft, and the small iron beds were neatly arranged. When our legs stepped into the door, the children who were awake all looked up with happy faces, their eyes spinning around as they looked at us, their tender white hands reaching for the railings on both sides of the bed. Lively and healthy, it was impossible not to smile with satisfaction from the bottom of my heart. Who can say that these children are weak?</p>
<p>Walking to the nursery, it was even more endearing. Every little angel was fast asleep. In a cradle near the door, it is said that the one sleeping is the little cat just born to Ms. Ye Mao Wang Renmei.</p>
<p>Before leaving, in order to get a more concrete answer to the question of whether China urgently needs nurseries, I asked about the reasons for keeping the children. Director Yang showed me a recent statistical table, which I am copying below for scholars to study.</p>
<p>Due to job constraints 18</p>
<p>Want to receive good education 12</p>
<p>Because of household chores 6</p>
<p>Do not trust wet nurses 7</p>
<p>Too many children 5</p>
<p>No one to take care of mother 4</p>
<p>Mother sick 3</p>
<p>Unable to balance studies 2</p>
<p>Save money 1</p>
<p>However, this is not a labor nursery. The infants and toddlers of truly poor laborers are still unable to enter. Finally, Director Yang said that the nursery "has been full soon after its establishment." This proves the urgent need for nurseries in today's society.</p>
<h3>Random Chats While Enjoying the Cool Air</h3>
<p>— First</p>
<p>On hot summer evenings, after dinner, I often take a banana leaf fan and sit in the alley to enjoy the cool air. Here, there are no ladies or misses; a row of nannies and young maids are sitting. Running and jumping around are those lively children.</p>
<p>The nannies chat with each other, and the young maids joke together. They see each other every day and often rest in the alley, becoming thoroughly acquainted. Only I am lonely. I sit silently, mechanically waving my fan, but the heat does not diminish at all; and the vexation in my heart makes the heat even more unbearable. I am a little envious of that joyful group; they talk and laugh, forgetting the fatigue and the onslaught of the heat. Why can't I join their group and talk and laugh with them? So I walked closer to the young maids, teasing the baby and talking to the young maid. But I immediately felt uncomfortable: they treated me as they would treat their master, with fear and trepidation in their hearts; and I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy myself.</p>
<p>We cannot get close to lower-class women, nor can we understand their suffering, if we cannot abandon those feudal ideas of being first-class and so on.</p>
<p>In order to understand the lives of these nannies and young maids, I often look for opportunities to talk to them. Now, several of them often come to me to write letters home for them. I have become very familiar with them. Their lives are really as they themselves say: "Three times more bitter than Coptis chinensis." But their efforts, their struggles, and their spirit of struggling in a difficult life really make us admire them! Therefore, I want to introduce the conversations of a few to everyone; if there are people who sympathize with them and cry out their suffering and injustice in unison, improve their treatment a little, and elevate their personality a little, that is my original intention in writing this article.</p>
<p>丨Peng Ma丨</p>
<p>Peng Ma is the nanny in my landlord's house. She has been helping in the employer's house for more than a year. Her niece is also working here as a young maid, taking care of the children for the landlady.</p>
<p>She, about forty years old, is from Hunan, speaking with a strong local accent. A pair of small feet like swollen rotten eggplants, as if she had never washed her feet or changed her socks, her socks covered in dust. She spends almost all day in the kitchen; the weather is so hot that she must bake by the stove. She gets up before dawn to wash clothes. When I get up at six o'clock, she has already cooked porridge and gone to the market to buy vegetables. At night, she goes to bed later than anyone else: she has to wait for the madam to return at midnight or one o'clock before she can feel at ease to sleep.</p>
<p>One day, she came down from the drying rack after drying clothes, passing by my door; I asked her when she wanted me to write a letter? She knew I had spare time to write a letter for her, so she walked into my room and sat down. As soon as she sat down, she took a deep breath. It was as if she had been so busy all day that she couldn't breathe, and now that she was sitting down to rest, she finally exhaled.</p>
<p>"Is Madam not at home?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Zhang went to play mahjong."</p>
<p>"Your son's writing has improved a lot." (To be continued)</p>
