<p>時評</p>
<h3>西班牙時局之推測恒·</h3>
<p>日來西班牙時局不靖之電訊。屢見報章。國人對此新造之共和國。常以其地位無關歐洲之大局。故每忽略之。亦以平日忽略之故。致使其政治狀况。於一般人心中。幾成爲不可解之謎。疑其有復辟之可能者有之。慮其將爲共産之革命者亦有之。漠然不知其究竟者。亦不在少數焉然。自我人觀之。西班牙今日之政局雖不靖。然復辟已成極難能之事實。共産亦爲莫須有之惶慮。此後控制西班牙之政局者。當爲中右各黨也。</p>
<p>西班牙革命以還迄已三載。當其革命之初。除極左極右外。各黨之願望。莫不在去王室。自右翼之共和黨。以至左翼之社會黨。目標僉同。然於此共同之目標外。亦各有其特殊之要求。且皆思藉民主政治之手段。以求各黨欲望之貫澈。唯於國會開幕而後。以社會黨佔多數。右冀共和黨之阿柴那。卽與之聯合成立左傾内閣。此一内閣。控制西班牙之政局。幾有二年半之久。其政績之可得而述者。（一）爲没收敎産與參預復辟者之産業。分配佃農與自耕農。（二）爲製定勞工法。規定八小時工制。實施勞工保險。失業津貼。（三）爲限制軍人參預政治。不使軍隊成爲任何一黨派之工具。</p>
<p>以一革命不到三年之新國家。而有如許之成績。當可差强人意矣。然阿柴那内閣之所以倒。卽在此土地勞工之二問題上。蓋阿柴那之所爲。由右方各黨視之。已爲過激之舉動。由極左之無政府黨共産黨視之。則爲過於妥恊矣。如敎産之被没收而分配於農民者。不到敎産總額四分之一。復辟派産業之没收。又遲至去年夏末始實行。至於大部貴族之土地。則始終未行無償之没收。此爲無政府黨共産黨所深惡。故當阿柴那執政之時期。卽有此等暴烈分子之暴動。至於資産階級方面。以西班牙工業之糼穉。國外競爭之劇烈。自不容對勞動者爲過分之優待。故亦深惡阿柴那與社會黨之所爲。以是合力謀倒阿柴那。政局杌隉。幾於不可終日。至一九三三年九月七日。統總柴摩拉始逼。使阿柴那去職。不久卽行解散國會。於十一月十九日重行改選。結果右中翼各黨大勝。今日之勒樂内閣。卽以中右翼爲支持點。</p>
<p>故去年冬國會改選。實爲西班牙復傾右方之象徵。由此而後。左派各黨。於國會中卽成少數黨。再難支配政局。因是而促使社會黨與共産黨無政府黨成立大聯合。訴諸非法之暴動。當爲極自然之趨勢。然此三黨。貎似相近。實極枘鑿。暫時携手固或可能。眞正合作。實談不到。故其無法轉移政局。可以預卜至於復辟運動。要亦難能。蓋天主敎黨對於共和黨之態度。最近亦已變遷。共和黨苟不危及敎會之存在。彼等固不主復辟。加以目今之軍隊。已國家化。王室更難利用之也。以故衡情酌理。復辟共産。兩不可能。西班牙此後之政局。當在中右各派之手而不易搖動。總揆雖或變更。大局不致有何影響也。</p>

<h3>意奥匈三角會議開始</h3>
<p>表面側重經濟商務</p>
<p>揆其實在聯合制德</p>
<p>會議將謀擴大羅致小恊约國加入</p>
<p>傳德計畫開築新運河破壞意政策</p>
<p>羅馬　自本日起奥總理陶爾斐斯·匈總理貢博斯·同受意大利政府之正式招待、視爲國賓、陶爾斐斯將於本日正午與墨索里尼首相作首次之會商、匈總理貢博斯與奥國前副總理温克萊、則於今晨十時開始共同工作、貢博斯於會見陶爾斐斯後、卽接見德國駐意大使、午刻將由雪祁親王設宴欵待、凡奥匈兩國在羅馬之要人、均將參加、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>奥揆宣言保持獨立</h3>
<p>羅馬　奥總理杜爾夫斯今日在此間舉行三角會議之前、對客聲稱、意奥匈三國現竭力阻止多瑙河諸國作互相殘害之爭鬥、致耗盡其力、奥國之職務、在調和多瑙河各國而使之團結、爲達此目的計、奥國必須保持其自主權與獨立、此點已爲近事所證明云、奥總理今晨與意相會商頗久、後又與匈總理從事討論、聞奥國欲得利用特利斯特爲通海出路之美滿條件、並欲增多奥國木料在意之銷數、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>羅馬　與政局安危世界和平有關之意匈奥三國會議、今日在此間開幕、三國之閣揆相繼蒞會、進行討論關於德奥之危急時勢、奥國邊境今日共屯駐意國軍隊十萬人、凖備隨時迎撃侵犯二國之任何敵人、捷克南斯拉夫及羅馬尼亞則亦凖備在事變中作戰、意相墨索里尼奥首揆杜爾夫斯匈首揆貢博斯今日在羅馬之集議、將决定對於德國國社黨危害奥國時三國所採取之行動、以實現三國間之恊定、大會秘書處所發之文告則稱、此會之目的、在討論三國間之經濟關係、然外間則信會議之主要議題、爲與德奥局勢有關之政策、首相墨索里尼首先發言、要求放棄政治行動之言論、轉以討論增强奥國之地位、以抗拒國社黨侵佔之陰謀、蓋此舉所以避免戰禍也、首相墨索里尼對於軍縮趨及歐州之政治交涉、表示其厭惡、並宣稱、彼個人將力挽歐洲中部之危局云、奥首揆杜爾夫斯在起程赴羅馬前、對於内閣閣員曾作一重要之調動、此舉所以增强保王黨之勢力以抑國社黨、並藉此稍抑奥國國内之不靖份子、哈頓斯親王現被任爲國防部長、以奥國現狀論、國防部長實爲奥國政府最重要之職位、此職以前曾由首相杜爾夫斯兼攝云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>關係中歐前途</h3>
<p>羅馬　奥匃總揆聯袂來此、與意當局商榷與中歐前途至有關係之要事、故世人目光現咸集中於羅馬、歐洲執政者無一不密切注視此間事態之進展、</p>
<h3>英法密切注視</h3>
<p>同時路透社探悉英政府完全表示同感、祇須避免危險的政治糾紛耳、法政府覺多惱河盆地之復興、與事有益、此種態度或可使小協約國以友好目光、注視羅馬談話、</p>
<h3>奥揆受寵若驚</h3>
<p>昨夜奥總理杜爾夫斯抵羅馬時、歡迎之禮、至爲隆重、意相墨索里尼及許多大員親往迎迓、而奥總理驅車往官邸時、幾同凱旋式之游行、街中觀者如堵、歡呼之聲不斷、奥總理受此榮寵、似非其始料所及、乃舉其手、作法西斯式之敬禮以答之、</p>
<h3>三國互提說帖</h3>
<p>談判戕於今日開始、目的在成立經濟同盟、如果成功、則及於歐洲前途者將有遠大的政治關係、又不僅經濟已也、意奥匈三方面已提出說帖、爲談話根據、意國說帖以斯特萊薩會議（查一九三二年開此會議時、有十五國討論中歐與東歐之財政與經濟改造問題）之條陳爲基本、主張締結雙方的經濟與地方協定、</p>
<h3>商業棘手難題</h3>
<p>匈總理星期一日抵此、已與意相討論商業問題、尤注重意匈運費事、此乃棘手難題、蓋匈國輸出、大都爲米穀與牲畜、而意國則不需米穀、且可從南斯拉夫國購置較賤之牲畜、以南斯拉夫國距意較近也、同様困難亦將於意奥間遇之、蓋依天然形勢、意國最宜與南斯拉夫通商、而奥國以與捷克互通貿易爲最宜也、是以意國亟欲擴大其會議之範圍、而羅致捷克南斯拉夫與羅馬尼亞三小恊約國加入會議、</p>
<h3>捷克對意和緩</h3>
<p>捷克近已和緩其對意之態度、但猶不願遽與意國握手、惟據傳聞、捿克外長庇恩士現願來唔意相、說明一切、</p>
<h3>决心援奥獨立</h3>
<p>衆信意奥匈三國總揆之會議、不致涉及粤國帝制恢三國總揆之會議、不致涉及奥國帝制恢復之困難事件、小恊約國已明白表示、彼等將視奥國之復辟、爲使人立卽宣戰之行爲、意相主旨在保持奥國獨立、此爲衆所公認者、蓋以奥國若隷於德國支配之下、則歐洲均勢將爲之擾亂也、奥國因特里亞隆和約、而喪失土地甚多、今欲得意國之援助、以伸其修改此約及其他不利的條約之要求、</p>
<h3>德國劃策破壞</h3>
<p>傳說德總理希特勒現已籌一妙計、俾破壞奥國對意日臻友好之局勢、擬築一運河、貫通多瑙與愛爾白兩大河、以免意相以經過特利斯特與阜姆兩處而至愛德里亞海之出路、誘致奥匈、蓋築此運河之計劃如見實施、則多瑙河之商業、將轉向德國、而德國在中歐之優越地位、更確定矣、（十四日路透社電）</p>

<h3>復辟運動更進一步</h3>
<p>德南反對奥復帝制</p>

<p>（柏林）　總理希特勒昨日接見南斯拉夫公使巴魯齊格、兩人談話之間、似同意反對粤國哈布斯堡皇室之復辟、德國政界對於兩人會晤、認爲關係極重大、並謂巴魯齊格本日已離柏林、遄返南國京城、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>德對法二次覆文</h3>
<p>措辭和緩暫不發表</p>

<p>舞女尹秋蓮</p>
<h3>訴追美容損失</h3>
<p>被高利利毆傷面部疤痕宛在</p>
<p>舞客多加輕視收入大受影響</p>
<p>前在愛多亞路安樂宫舞塲爲舞女之奉天人尹秋蓮、因細故與其同伴舞女高利利發生意見、去年十月廿三號下午、尹忽被毆傷面部、遂延律師向第一特區法院刑庭、自訴高利利傷害罪、結果高被判罰金三十元、但尹秋蓮以已身係屬舞女、全賴面容嬌秀、藉博收入、自被高毆傷後、</p>
<h3>面部疤痕</h3>
<p>猶在、迄今未能恢復原狀、對於收入大受影響、此種損失、均屬高利利所造成、遂仍延江宗泮律師另向特院民庭起訴、請求判令高利利賠償美容損失及醫藥費等洋三千元、昨晨、由余長資推事蒞民十一庭傳審、被告高利利未到、委巢堃律師代理到案、卽據尹秋蓮投案聲明、彼不能操華語、欲以</p>
<h3>英語陳述</h3>
<p>此時被告代理律師巢堃聲明原告實能操極流利之國語、法官爲明瞭案情起見、乃命翻譯官潘君爲舌人、據尹稱、年廿二歲、瀋陽人、家住靶子路一百十六號、於去年十月五號、由青島來滬、越三天、卽獨往法租界愛多亞路安樂宫舞塲欲見經理金姓、其時被告高利利在塲、因從高之挽留、卽在該塲爲舞女、所得舞資、則與舞塲各半分拆、如遇舞客、</p>
<h3>額外酬報</h3>
<p>歸已獨得、我在該塲充舞女、前後祗兩星期、每天凈得舞資五元或十元、自去年十月廿三日被高毆傷後、卽有二個多月未進舞塲、直至去年年底前兩天、我至大華舞塲充舞女二天、其時有許多舞客因見我面有傷疤、疑我有不規則行爲、而與客人爭吵所致、羣相譏笑、使我難堪故以後卽</p>
<h3>裹足不去</h3>
<p>余推事問曰、在此受傷之兩月中、爾曾往其他舞塲充當舞女否、尹答、無、又問曾否參加盛大之讌會、答、在去年耶蘇聖誕節、與數華人同往辣斐花園跳舞一次、問、爾現欲高利利賠償三千元、如何算法、答、因我兩月未做生意、伙食尙須自備、如無打架之事發生、則可另至其他舞塲營業、進欵不能計算、蓋一般舞女、大都以</p>
<h3>容貎美麗</h3>
<p>爲前提、而我面上疤痕宛在、不知何時可以恢復、現雖在維也納舞塲伴舞、但一至晚間、電炬通明、我之面容被毁、疤痕頗爲明顯、致爲客所憎、不受歡迎、生涯清淡、實深痛恨、目下延請南京路面容專家王醫生診治、注稱藥水、據云須兩月後方能退疤、所受損失、計前醫院醫藥費洋二百元、及兩月中每天卅元之損失費一千八百元、尙有一千元、則爲賠償</p>
<h3>美容損失</h3>
<p>云云、庭上核供、乃諭令和解、不必涉訟、并着各自讓步、尹秋蓮卽表示最低限度須賠償一千元、此時被告律師卽起稱、前時原告曾自允祗須拉兩只檯子、卽備酒二席、每席十二元、作爲合歡酒以便盡釋前隙、餘均不談、今旣蒙庭上</p>
<h3>善意和解</h3>
<p>敝律師願代被告聲明再負擔本案訴訟費用、嗣原告律師以前有高利利之代表王某曾至彼事務所表示、願以五百元作爲和解條件、當時因原告負債五百元、且尙受損失、故未允許、今請飭傳被告到案、俾可當面和解　云、余推事乃諭本案改期試行出外和解、如和解不成、再行調查證據審理、</p>

<h3>移公安局</h3>
<p>開庭後、郁庭長卽詢及香港證據事項、被告律師吳凱聲答稱、香港路途遙遠、有利被告證據、當時尙不及提出、請求再展期二週、並准予交保出外、俾被告得一自省之機會、繼由公安局督察員聲稱、近在公安局自首之趙林（原名孟永祥）供出李默農爲共産黨員、且爲現任江蘇省委兼宣傳部長、並可到庭作證、後卽由捕房律師稱述第二次改期、已予被告提出證據之機會、故對移提公安局、不加反對、最後於十一時餘法院乃將李默農移解公安局、</p>

<h3>解警備部</h3>
<p>其後公安局提出有關證件多種、均極確鑿、李默農閱後、乃祗得草就供狀、自認爲共産黨員、不過對於自首悔過部份、仍未加以首肯、公安局此時爲求法律上公平之判斷、因卽於前夜將李默農又復提解至本市警備司令部、聽侯審訊、</p>

<p>讀書間答</p>
<h3>讀書方法論的討論（四）</h3>
<p>以上已將汪君來信所提出問題，由編者將讀書方法上一般問題討論過了，現在再就讀書技術上一些經騐再與汪君討論，編者</p>
<p>讀書第一固然要講求方法論，有了方法論之後，　不致使思想散漫，而能得到系統的知職。但是在讀一本書時，怎様就可以使所讀的書不等於不讀，怎様從書中可以得到啓發；怎様就可以把該書的重要内容，或作者所說的幾句精彩的話和你認爲錯誤的地方記住；或者用什麽方法，可便於異日檢查；這種「讀書效率」方法，也是應當講求的。我們前面說過，隨便讀書時，讀過一本書後，該書的内容當時或許記得，但隔不久這種糢糊的印象是會很快地遺忘的。而且，在讀某學科的「概論」或「綱要」之類的入門書時，這種書的綱領，基礎原則尤應全部熟記在心中，單是零零碎碎記住某原則的意義，卽使記得很詳細，也是没有用的。這種書應當把它的重在内容均匀地記住，却無須乎背熟他的某一部分。現在提供幾個最流行的讀書方法，供你參考。</p>
<p>（一）加缐—在讀書時，一邊讀，一邊在書上將其綱領處或重要的文句，用紅藍鉛筆在旁邊劃線。普通讀西洋書者的畫缐法，最好的處所是底線，其次是圈，再其次是頁旁的直線。　　（二）眉批—犯一章或一節的主要意思，簡單的用一兩句話或十幾個字寫在書上端或書之兩旁的餘白上，這種方法呌做眉批。</p>
<p>（三）札記—這是學者所最常用的方法，是效率很大的方法，但亦是很笨的方法。因爲做札記是要化很多時間的。不過這種方法若行之得當，並不是得不償失，所以於我們這種忙人們讀書，仍是有益的。札記可分三種：（一）是摘錄—其方法爲一面讀，一面把作者的特見，精警的文句，抄下來；（二）是書後—就是不但摘錄語句，並且對於作者的批評，意見等也寫在上面；（三）是摘要—這種辦法與眉批的性質是差不多的，不過也有迴然不同的地方，就是眉批是隨讀隨做，而這是讀完後做的；眉批是寫在原書上，這是寫在另外一本簿子上的；眉批是照原來的章節摘出，而這是可以已意另立大綱不必拘拘於原來形式，且可附加意見。這三種方法都是有用的，不過要看你讀書的程度，和讀物而定。譽如你是讀社會科學的，如果基礎知識已具，而讀專門的着作或某種問題時，那麽你就應當用第一法，因爲專門問題前面常有一兩章緒論之類的東西，譬如一本討論貨幣購買力的書罷，它前面就先述貨幣的性質，關於貨幣的各種解釋等等，這些東西，你如果讀過一本好的經濟學概論，你是都會知道的，所以你就不必用眉批畫線等方法去把這些東西扎出。但是作者對於貨幣的特殊意見，你却應當注意，這些地方你就應當抄下來。如果是讀名家著作，那就以書後的方法較爲適宜，因爲你旣把它的名言抄下來，同時你亦可把後人對於他的批評及你個人的意見寫上。但若你基礎知識尙未具備，或是對於某一學科尙未具備一點知識，而是剛剛想着乎去做初步研究的人，那就不能用前二種方法了。因爲你在入乎時定然是先讀一本該學科「概論」之類的著作，這種書大都是敎科書的性質，所以它所叙述的祗是最流行的學說，是該學科的一般的性質。這些書中没有特别精采的章句，可供你拔萃，但是該學科的重要原則或大綱，你却應記住的，所以用提要法，或者提要與眉批並用，是要比較好些。</p>
<p>總之，做扎記爲預備日後翻閱到是次要的目的，最主要的是因爲在做扎記時可使你把書上所述的東西在腦經中多盤旋一次，使你可以對於作者所說的話，多加一番考慮。因此，這三種方法中要算第一法最不經濟，做這種工作，我們所浪費的精力頗爲不少，所以這種方法，對於著作家固大有用處（因爲著作時便於引證）但在我們這般不想做學者著作家，爲着實益讀書的人，却是得不償失。然而這種拔萃的方法雖笨，益處究有，所以我們把它的方法稍加修改，仍舊是可用的。這種方法的所以笨，就是他要一句一句的抄下來，這實在太費時間，但如果我們不一句一句的抄取，自已用簡單的句子摘述原意，同時并把書名人名某卷某頁記下，以便異日翻閱，這様，時間旣化費不多，而益處却未减少。</p>
<p>（四）重讀—有些人喜多讀書，却不肯將一本好書精讀或多讀幾遍，這是很大的毛病，這種讀書爲什麽不對呢？其原因是這様的：讀者在初讀書時，他實「茫無頭緒」，以爲學問「浩如烟海」，書籍是「汗牛充棟」。誠然這是不錯的。但是他因此想盡量去讀各種書，却是大大的毛病。一個人的精力固然有限，不能讀盡天下書，同時有許多書也是無須讀的。一種學科的概論書，坊間就有幾十種。有些人以爲應當都讀一遍，其實這是大錯特錯，這些書的内容大致是相同的，你祇要擇一本較精審的書熟讀幾遍，把内容在致記得，較之濫讀各書，結果反弄得糢糢糊糊，對於該學科的一般性質，一無所知，其利害眞是不可以道里計。所以好書多讀幾遍，不但不會耗費時間，反而是非常經濟的。因爲你初讀一本書時，印象一定很淺，及至再讀時，你决計可發現許多前次所忽略的地方，對於作者的意見也能更深刻了解些。但這當然是指權威之作，或應當精讀的書而言，一班僅堪瀏覽的書當然是無須這様下功夫的。　　讀書的方法大致如此，不過你却不應墨守成法，你應隨時試騐修改。又，本文所述的方法，除編者依個人經騐稍有補充外，大致均述自鶴見佑輔氏的「讀書的方法」。見思想，山水，人物一二一頁。北新版。）你如有暇，不妨看看那篇文章。</p>

<p>— 呐喊</p>
<p>第十届遠東運動大會，不久要在菲島啓幕！</p>
<p>第二届世界運動大會，定於一九三六年在柏林開演！一個是近在眼前；一個似乎還是來日方長。</p>
<p>近在眼前的遠東運動大會，我們的出席選乎問題，已由中華全國體恊會籌議辦法。來日方長的夏令配克，一般人似乎尙未注意。</p>
<p>據最近的電訊：一九三六年在柏林舉行的夏令配克大會，已有五十餘國接得德國邀請參加的公函。在邀請函中，申述了日耳曼民族希望世界各友邦慨允參加，派選精鍊的運動員來一角雌雄的友誼話。</p>
<p>德總理希特勒氏已决定劃柏林西交辟茲勒斯堡區二百八十五英畝林木秀蔚的曠地做大會會塲。從事建築可以容納十萬觀衆的競技塲；塲外設置可容二十五萬人的游藝塲。</p>
<p>日耳曼體育會的專門會議，已經决定：「由全國各村市都會分别舉行競技比賽，遴選競技員；再由各地選手集合比賽，精選人材，加以長時期的特别訓練。政府方面將給予充分的贊助！」</p>
<p>世界大舞台上，一向幾乎没有我們的角色！一切的技術，我們連尾巴都還没抓住！同様的身手，我們何以不堪和人家抗衡？</p>
<p>一九三二年的秋天，在洛杉磯舉行的世界運動大會參加的四十五國中，印度也還得了五分。蕞爾的瑞士，烏拉圭也各得四五分。我們切齒的「芳鄰」，—日本—他畢竟有面子，以一百五十三分得到全會的第六名。我們那時出席的代表祗有劉長春。我們的成績是一個大鴨蛋！</p>
<p>一九三六年的夏令配克，我們是否要到柏林去摸鴨蛋呢？摸鴨蛋也午凖備幾個够資格的身手。否則連鴨蛋也輪不着我們去摸；那就更加講不過去了。</p>
<p>我們要凖備去遠東奪「交椅」的身手！</p>
<p>我們要凖備一九三六年去柏林摸「鴨蛋」的身手！</p>
<p>我們要使世界大舞臺上漸漸顯露出我們的角色；因爲</p>
<p>我們具備着同様的身手！</p>
<h3>春來了</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>春來了！「春」這一個字，人們聽了，多少會覺得它是孕含着「美麗」「快樂」「生機勃發」「去舊更新」……種種的意味。不必是要「春風桃李」「春江花月」「春色惱人」……種種的呈現，纔會知道「春之神」的能力。</p>
<p>「貓兒在呌，狗兒在跳」這是動物的春思。「有女懷春，吉士誘之」這是公子哥兒千金小姐的春意。「春宵一刻値千金」，那是逛跳舞塲玩窑姐兒的惜春。「春色惱人眠不得」，這是犯單戀病的傷春「春」，眞說不盡有許多花様，萬般快樂。我歡迎你來，也希望你永留人間，使人人春風滿面，春意滿懷，永久保存着青春腺，到老也不會死去。</p>
<p>從前的人，到底想不穿，對此大好春光，輕易抛去，埋首在「飢不能當食寒不能爲衣」的書本子裏。老古董的邵堯夫，還說甚麽「一歲之計在於春」，硬把許多人拖下冷宫，眞是不該。倒是李白那酒鬼想得穿，所以說「古人秉燭夜遊，良有以也」。這様一辯，自已大可以「日以繼夜」拚命地喝酒。</p>
<p>熱鬧的都會，四時皆春，號稱東方巴黎的上海，當然也不能例外。一到了晚上，年紅燈的光芒，賣笑者的歌唱，隨處可以見著聽着。狂吻和半裸的電影，肉的誘惑的舞塲，没一處不宣告客滿。酒的香，烟的味，女人的氣息，洋錢的光芒，充滿在大上海的夜裏，大上海成了一個四時皆春的都會，男男女女，顚顚倒倒在這人工製造的春風裏。</p>
<p>嘿！春來了！在這上海，公園裏又來了若干青年的男女；龍華道上又多了若干坐汽車折桃花的人；外國人的公司裏，又銷云了若干高價春衣料。上海人對於春，祗有這一些些驚人的成績。</p>
<h3>壁報</h3>
<p>— 史濟宏</p>
<p>春秋上談過了許許多多的東西；但，關於學校的，却從春秋有史以來，恐怕積不了十分之一，這兒我來凑一篇「壁報」，充充數罷！</p>
<p>出壁報不是件容易的事，雖然在它上面没有堂而皇之的寫出編輯人是誰；發行人是誰。不過要不是在校中有相當勢力的學生，這一張壁報黏到墻壁上去，不消一點鐘，就可以「雪花飄飄」；卽使用了玻璃框子，也會給人家打碎了的，再不然，學校當局也不肯給你立案，卽使有私出的發現，也一定要壁報充公，人卽正法。（記過或吃大菜也）</p>
<p>文壇上有人互相攻撃，當然大家以筆尖相抵，在各人各的地盤上，不惜費了篇幅，作個人報復之用，小而言之，壁報也何嘗不是，譬如說，作者校内有一個××劇社，原定去年十二月二十四日舉行處女公演，戲券也已發出數百張，卒因壁報竭力攻撃，一張五角的戲券，到今天還在作者袋中，甚矣哉，壁報。　　在這區區一張壁報上，可以得許多意想不到的收獲，雖則它没有廣告；收服小𠶭囉，爲開全體學生大會時候之用，征服女學生，使伊們不敢對他—編輯先生，待慢，都是功用。</p>
<p>至於稿件，當然是根本不生問題，這裏且擱開不談它的來源，可是爲什麽誰都見了是一帖藥，爲什麽飯堂上的小菜是特别豐富，兩個外黨有什麽糾紛，祇要他便可片言折獄，女同學爲什麽肯無條件給他們寫稿，打圍巾，結手套，全待續者們去體會了，</p>
<p>五色詩</p>
<p>— 陳小翠</p>
<h3>紅悲失地也</h3>
<p>絕塞烽烟亂火鴉。旌旗滿地尙中華。秦樓夢醒三竿日。趙壁兵移一夜笳。誤汝胭脂同辱井。惱人顔色是櫻花。斜陽絕似英雄血。抹上城頭作暮霞。</p>
<h3>黄憂鄰寇也</h3>
<p>大漢平沙落日光。長城衰草已全荒。漫將蠟色誇同種。羞見葵心媚太陽。亂後頭顱皆岌岌。新標名號自堂堂。龍旗袞服渾兒戲。皇帝何如石敬塘。</p>
<h3>綠憶昔游也</h3>
<p>池塘草長亂蛙聲。五百垂楊住碧城。萬點嵐光驢背重。一江春水鴨頭輕。山巔樓閣看微雨。鏡裏雲天媚早晴。分得黛螺無用處。他生留寫妙蓮經。</p>
<h3>青因綠非正色重作此</h3>
<p>卿衫儂鬢兩惺惺。竹院爐烟分外清。湖上雨晴天一色。田中風過浪千層。開樽阮籍垂星眼。上塚馮娘記小名。長憶柳陰芳草地。艾泥團子過清明。</p>
<h3>黑傷今日也</h3>
<p>塗鴉草草常嫌淡。華髮莖莖染不濃。幕後牽絲都近墨。雪中送炭豈能紅。　魚噀液逃身易。鬼蜮含沙射影工。不見不聞非易事。睡鄉蟻夢尙重重。</p>
<h3>白美甘地也</h3>
<p>皎皎秋桐濯太陽。漫將無敵比齊王。曝鹽澣海千層雪。散牧平原萬點羊。虚室頭陀生妙想。布衣丞相有輝光。芒碭赤帝龍蛇鬥。鬼母宵啼鬢有霜。</p>
<h3>五色</h3>
<p>惟有光明生燦爛。龍翔鳳蔚滿遙空。山巓雲彩看初日。樓角斜陽掛斷虹。織女坐機裁異錦。媧皇鍊石補蒼穹。陸離光怪君休訝。鏖世文章本不同。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十五回淚臉送人辭家歸遠戌風沙澈夜出塞駐孤城</p>
<p>在風沙撲面的情况下，東方已經有些魚肚色了，遠遠看見半圈子土堡，在山凹中發現了。土堡上，還有座三層樓眼的碉樓，突立在空際，便覺這一片帶着些零落樹木的山頭，别是一種風味。看那城堡，很靜穆的夾立在山谷間，並不見得有什麽動靜。大家的呼吸，彷彿也短促起來，眼望着那山堡，只管走去。到了城堡邊，却見堡門兩扇洞開，一個牽駱駝的鄉下人，正由裏面出來。看到這一大羣大兵，槍刀林林的走了上來，嚇慌了，丢了繩索，轉身便向城堡裏跑。寳芳看看離着城堡有幾十步路，又命令軍隊停止了，却呌了自强到面前，向他道：趙連長，你帶兩名弟兄進堡去，和堡董說清楚了我們的來意，我們再進去。趙自强答應着，也不肯多帶人，除了兩名隨從兵而外，只讓上士王七立跟着。進得堡去，裏面倒有四五十户人家，全是黄泥糊稭秫的房屋，其間却有好幾處亂石堆的短墻，圍繞着空地，分明是坍倒久了的屋基。天色剛亮，又是風沙天，堡裏人都未曾起床。自强向士立道：這地方呌平安寨，只在地圖上看到這名字，旅長有命令，說是這地方很要緊，這裏省軍旣不管，敵人又很注意，我們要在大家冷不防的時候，接防過來。來了就來了罷，營長又怕駭唬了百姓，還要來個先禮而後兵，這怱怱忙忙的跑來，那裏去找堡董去，我們胡亂呌開一家門，找個百姓問問就得了。士立站在一堵泥土壁下呢，聽到屋裏有人說：天還早呢，我還睡一會兒罷。（三三六）</p>

<h3>銀價與國貨</h3>
<p>— 潘吟閣</p>
<p>近來國人提倡國貨，可謂不遺餘力。就良心上講，誰不願意購用國貨。然提倡自提倡，國貨銷塲還是有限。洋貨進口，還是源源不絕。就是日貨一項，去年進口的已經有二萬萬元。到底其中有什麽道理呢。據我看起來，其中最在的原因，就是洋貨價錢便宜的緣故。洋貨傾銷，這是大家都知道的事情。要知洋貨傾銷中國，何以能使各物價格一律跌落，其中自有一個巧妙的方法。這方法是英國人最先實行。英國在民國二十年九月十七日把金鎊紙幣停止兌現。所以上海先令價錢，就慢慢兒便宜起來。因此英國的疋頭棉紗等貨物，在中國人看起來價錢似乎一律便宜些。先令一天天的賤起來，英國貨就一天天便宜起來，銷路也一天天發達起來。英國之所以停止兌現，是由歐洲的金融風潮。（歐洲這個風潮便誘起東三省九一八事變，要是歐洲没有這風潮，東三省或許没有事變·）豈知却因此發現東方貿易的新生命。蓋此時英國在中國的生意，頗爲日本所侵奪。自先令跌價以後，無意中覓得一條出路。眞所謂「塞翁失馬，安知非福。」英國得了先令低落的利益以後，第一個眼紅的，當然是吾們的貴鄰。彼國自政友會的犬養毅内閣上臺以後，馬上把金圓紙幣停止兌現。這裏邊一半因爲財政上的關係；一半却是爲了貿易上關係。果然日本自停兌金圓以後，日貨十分便宜，比英國還要便宜。這就是日貨源源進口的重要原因。</p>
<p>自從英日在中國市塲上得了勝利以後，更掀動了太平洋對岸的山叔叔。他老先生覺得他的金洋，實在貴得太利害了。横堅戰債一時總不能歸清，倒反吃眼前的虧，把他在中國的通商利益先犧牲了。所以彼國自從羅斯福總統登臺以來，就唱一齣停兌金圓的全本好戲。這齣戲愈唱愈起勁，中間再添加一齣連合各國訂定銀恊定以抬高銀價的壓軸戲。讀者諸公試想他一面把金圓抑低，一面把銀子抬高，所爲何來？這無非想在用銀的中國推銷便宜貨罷了。所以在東北方面有吾們的貴鄰，在用武力來侵略。兩年以來鑼鼓喧天，鬧得不成様子。而西洋方面却鬧一個貨幣戰。入超之數，遂開通商史上的新紀元。竟達七萬萬元之巨額。據我看來，一年七萬萬，十年七十萬萬，十年之後，中國就是太平無事，也設亡國了。總之，中國今日完全是他人追逐之瘦肉。（不肥了）追逐之慾無盡，而中國之血肉有限。銀問題就是國貨問題，就是民族生命問題，如何善處，誠吾國各界領袖的責任。</p>
<h3>婦女推銷土布</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>—婦女國貨年之好消息—</p>
<p>本埠小西門蓬萊市塲内之上海土布商店，係上海縣敎育局縣農民敎育館等領袖所發起，其宗旨是爲推銷眞正國産土布，而增進農民生活，與專事牟利者情形不同。蓋上海縣之農民，除耕種田地外，均以紡織布疋爲副業，近來習尙奢華，舶來品充斥市塲，國人服用土布者逐漸减省，九一八與一二八慘案相繼發生後，銀根奇緊，四鄉布莊週轉不靈，乏欵赴鄉收買土布，致農婦日夜辛勤織成之物，竟無人顧問，貨旣擱淺，無錢再購原料以紡織，咸束手待斃而蹙額愁眉。縣當局以爲農村經濟破産，不特於農民生活有關，並且欲影響全縣之治安，故竭力提倡，設法改良，除曾開土布展覧會以資宣傳外，並設中國布衣會，勸人入會，而實踐布衣救國之宣言，爲便於改良土布起見，復與中華紡織工業社潘仰堯王志莘諸同志，發起土布改良會，而創設土布工廠，並特約織户，派員指導，給以原料，俾便工作。因蓬萊市塲附近均係學校，學生制服，業經徐佩璜潘公展兩敎育局長通令採用土布，故在此設立商店，以廣推銷，計分門市與服裝兩部，所有布様，計有自由呢，中山呢，和平布，人字呢，雪恥布，雲霞布等十餘種，花様有綫蘆，狹蘆，條子，方格，骰子之别，顔色紅白灰藍俱備。因今歲係婦女國貨年，故特聘無錫競志女校高材生王卓秋女士，擔任推銷，王女士曾充交通部職員，及蕪湖航政局給證股股長，夙擅交際，特製紫色土布旗袍，四週以黑白斜條滾邊，遠視之宛似青種洋，上罩棉毛呢短衣，黑滾而綴以白銀紐扣，穿往各校，以作活動商標，而勸各生購置，已經定製者，計有上海女中，愛羣，清心，民立，惠羣，務本，中國，惠靈，巽與，梅溪，虹路等數十校，此亦婦女國貨年内之好消息也。</p>
<h3>家庭與國貨</h3>
<p>— 穆因</p>
<p>中國人提倡國貨，不止一年了。去年是國貨年。考其結果，連衣食住行四種人生所必需的東西，差不多還是完全用外國貨，試問還成什麽國家。所以我們若想不亡國，必須要提倡國貨，挽回利權！</p>
<p>國貨年已經過去了，婦女國貨年還剛纔開始　所以今年提倡國貨的責任，姊妹們應該幹點成績出來！可是男子們並不因此可以卸責，任意的服用外國貨，要知道提倡國貨是人民天職，拚命努力，中國才有救！所以提倡國貨是自救救人的最好方法！</p>
<p>婦女國貨年，姊妹們想幹點成績出來，第一應該從整個的家庭着手，因此我們想談談「家庭與國貨」</p>
<p>我們不講别的，單講中國一般中上階級家庭裏的太太小姐們，她們在衣着上，實在是一個十二分道地的義務推銷員。試看中國不是有很好的綢緞和呢絨嗎？像美亞織綢廠的糺縵縐和最新出品的二三年春式蘿娜綢，鴻新梁織廠的蝴蝶布蝴蝶绒，章華呢絨紡織公司出品的精美呢絨等都是很好的衣料，可是她們非但不願意用，還得必穿外國貨的什麽綢什麽呢什麽绒。至於日用牙膏，生髮油，胭脂，香粉，香水，雪花粉等類的東西，一様也有中國貨，而且出品都非常好，對外國貨並没有遜色，但是她們却非買外國貨不可。等而下之，一切的器皿和家具，似乎也非用外國貨原料製造的東西，不足以壯觀瞻。因爲這様的緣故，於是乎洋貨就自然而然的充斥到中止階級的家庭之内，彷彿是一件稀鬆平常的事。任何如何高唱「提倡國貨」，如果不是婦女們首先掮起這個責任來，中國有了貨也是銷不出，越是銷不出，國貨事業便越不能發達，因爲國貨事業不能發達，所以想改良也就没有力量，如此一來，國貨前途，永遠是無希望的　　總之提倡國貨，並不是少數人的責任，應當各就所能，通力合作，纔能濟事。我們用十二萬分的熱誠期望着中國各個家庭的主婦們，把提倡國貨的責任，擔負起來，抱定非國貨不用的宗旨，十年如一日，這様不但可以拒絕洋貨深入人們的日常生活中，中國或者也因此得救！親愛的姊妹們！跑上婦女國貨年的頂尖上努力吧！</p>
<h3>跑商場</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>「跑商塲」是句口頭譚，凡是住着本埠北河南路一帶，附近國貨商場的都懂得這句話，意思是以國貨商場去走一遭　　在上海寸金地，居大不易，孩子們躱在鷄籠般的屋子裏實在無處可消遣。一到夏天，出門外怕太陽晒；一到冬天，出門外怕寒風吹，爲此一般做母親的，便帶了孩子們到國貨商塲玩，這就是呌「跑商塲」。</p>
<p>凡婦女們能帶了小孩們跑商塲，不但解决了孩子們消遣問題，更有連帶着提倡國貨關係，在此婦女國貨年中，特地提出來貢獻給女界同胞。</p>
<p>一　國貨商塲是一向歡迎任何人去參觀的，那麽在你進去欣賞時，無意中能使你認識種種國貨的名稱和式様。</p>
<p>二　帶小孩子常去參觀，順便購買些日常需用物品，在你是買到了眞正國貨，在小孩子們能養成他愛用國貨的習慣。　　四　多跑國貨商塲，自然會多買些國貨—少去買洋貨。現祇就我們一家消費不大而論，短短的三兩月中已交易了十數元錢，若就附近商塲的居民以一千家而論，那麽交易的最低限度也該有一二萬元錢了這便可說是提倡國貨。</p>
<p>末了，我再附帶着說明一句，除了這裏所提起的北河南路的國貨商塲以外，南京路上也有好幾家國貨商塲，就是各地也有專賣國貨的塲所。還請女界同胞有機會多去跑跑。</p>
<h3>電木之製造</h3>
<p>— 馬一瓢</p>
<p>在最近南京路上各大公司國貨商塲裏，買一送一或買一送二的電木電玉物品，眞的打破了本年冬的不景氣，市面上鬧極一時了，牠們的顔色光彩實在可愛；尤其是電玉的像玉一般的色澤，比之玻璃優雅的多！在一年前電木電玉幾乎没有看見，到了現在，誰都知道了，用着了，但是牠們的天體到底是什麽？還有許多人不知道；所以我來介紹一下，以下先講電木，次講電玉。</p>
<p>電木或名膠木，原名Bakelite。係美國人貝克蘭（Bakeland）改良成功的，迄今已有廿三四年了。現在各國都會製造，名稱有十幾種之多，我國勝德公司也能製造。</p>
<p>電木的主要原料爲石炭酸Carbolicacid和蟻醛Formalin。製法以等量的石炭酸和蟻醛加鹼性縮合劑（如亞莫尼亞Ammonia）數時間加熱，則分上下二層，上層爲水，下層就是電木的初期縮合物。該縮合物爲液狀或固形，能溶解於酒精或丙酮（Acetone），性脆，加熱則融，恰同松香一様。若再熱則變爲一種硬性的固體，再不溶解於溶劑。然若把該固體置於模型中加以適當的熱度及壓力，便可壓成製品，而該固體終成一種不復溶解，不復融化的不可逆的物質。對於普通的酸及鹼均能抵抗，耐熱可至攝氏三百度，尤其對於電氣絕不傳導的一點是牠的特長，所以用之於塌電料，可說是最適當的材料。</p>
<p>電木物品所用的電木原料，是缩合物未成固體之前混以顔料及鋸屑或石綿，使其凝縮後搗成粉末的，普通稱爲電木粉（BakeliteMouldjngPowaer），</p>
<p>將電木粉放在鋼製模型中，熱至攝氏百六十度上下，用壓力機壓之，就得市面上所見的製品。</p>
<p>現在電木粉的産額以美國爲最多，年産八千萬元，德英次之，將來用途增廣發展正無限量，也算合成化學的光榮貢献話</p>
<h3>婦女界提出兩個問題</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>怎様使人滿意　怎様易於鑑别</p>
<p>國貨是人人知道應提倡，應服用，可是最困難的問題，是魚目混珠，無從辦别。蔡元培夫人在梵王渡俱樂部招待席上，首先提出這個問題，並說消費者明明要買國貨，因爲没有鑒别力，而受人愚弄，結果不免使人失望。接着是王孝英女士，代表婦女界提出兩點來：第一是生産的怎様使出品令人滿意？第二是怎様使國貨非國貨不致魚目混珠？最後潘公展夫人林克聰女士，也是對於這改進國貨，辨别國貨，認清國貨數點，作誠懇的陳述。後一天在湖社開會，蔡孑民先生黄任之先生也是發表了這些意見，因此吾來申說一下，也許是答復大家提出的意見：</p>
<p>辦事業難，辦國貨事業更難，一般工廠領袖，天天努力於改進出品，可是還不能得到許多人的滿意。這固然是技術上經濟上的關係，可是心理上的作用，也是很大，平心而論，你到國貨公司去看看，中國的國貨，不要說進步神速，卽是種類的增多，也是可驚可佩，買國貨的，倘是細心研究起來，多數國貨，可以替代外貨而有餘。卽使價格貴些，光彩差些，可是幼稚工業國家，能够做到這様，已覺十分可喜。倘使有犧牲心堅强心，信賴了國貨公司，便可無疑地儘量購用。</p>
<p>講到辨别一層，固然是要靠消費者自身的眼力，可是這個責任，國貨公司要負責的先行審查出品，如果有些懷疑，無論如何，不應替他販賣。消費者旣把這辨别的手續，完全付託國貨公司，那麽國貨公司該怎様的謹愼從事，嚴格執行，纔算完了國民應負的天職。一般顧客也可放心托膽。希望同時國民政府趕快把出産國標記條例凖期實行，不再瞻顧，而一般偷天換日李代桃僵的販賣商人，也該拿出良心，幡然改悟，不再做些魚目混珠的勾當。來欺人害人。婦女國貨年，去了四分之一了，大家該怎様的努力呀！</p>
<h3>信不信由你</h3>
<p>— 西因</p>
<p>如果任何一個達官貴人，能够親知穿起土貨來，那在下者必效而行之的！試徵諸古昔：秦奢而漢樸，漢之治也，世多長者之行；隋奢而唐樸，唐之治也，錦繡無所用之。我想倘使現在的國府要人也像漢唐那様尙樸起來，及其治也，仇貨必將無所用之。</p>
<p>不要說達官貴人，就是稍有名望的人起而行之，在下者亦必效之的。荆人炫服，有爲太者，好墨布，鄉人皆效之，帛不入境，染工遠徙。我想倘使現在的縣知事省主席也像太僕那様好國布，那至少一縣一省的人皆效之，而使仇貨不入境而遠徙之。</p>
<p>不要說有名望的人，就是單單一個匹夫，如能起而行之，鄉人亦能效之。陳友諒之父好衣褐，破蘄，不殺衣褐者。有洛之賈在蘄，以褐得免，歸而终身衣褐，鄉人皆效之，帛不入境，染工遠徙。我想在現在任何人也像洛之賈者那様終身穿國布，鄉人或者也能效之，而使仇貨不復入境。</p>
<h3>校長的女兒</h3>
<p>— 寒玉</p>
<p>年假已經過了，還家的學生，都回到學校裏來。在人布告板上，看見一張很奇異的佈告：</p>
<p>「今日下午四時，本校舉行女生談話會。望女同學一律出席！此佈，校長室。」那時許多人的推测，也許是爲了聯歡會的事罷。</p>
<p>到了下午四時，大禮堂裏，坐滿了女生。她們急於要知道開談話的意義，都望着入口的地方。停了一會，看見校長的女兒，從入口慢慢的走到台上去，這已經使她們都驚異了。更加使她們驚奇的，校長的女兒，今天已經不穿她艶麗的衣服，却穿了一件藍布的旗袍，面上的脂粉也不敷了。</p>
<p>校長的女兒，本來是那校校花。她求學的目的，只求及格就算了。及格以後，再也不肯去讀那種學科了。她最注意的，就是在裝飾上面。從頭上，臉上，身上，到脚上，没有一件，不想爭勝全校的女生。在資格和裝飾，她差不多做了全體女生的領袖。校内的女生，雖然盡力的要穿得比她更新艶，更美麗，但是没有一個人能勝她的。今天她竟這様的不加修飾，當然，這使她們都很驚異的。</p>
<p>校長的女兒到了壇上，就開始講她的話了：「諸位也許很驚異，今天我的裝飾，爲什麽變了這様？其實，我可以告訴諸位，這是我的新生！今天我可以把新生的經過告訴給諸位：在元旦那天，我去參加婦女交誼大會。我去參加的目的，實在没有什麽意義。但是在那會裏，我却受了很大的感動。因此我就得了新生。我的新生是什麽呢？就是服用國貨！我服用國貨的目的，就是要救中國！我們用外貨，是爲了求美麗的緣故。我但是美麗的代價，怎及得愛國呢？我們不可以用同様的國貨來替代麽？卽使國貨有不及外貨的地方，我們不能爲了愛國而略損我們的美麗麽？現在我已得到了新生，希望諸位也得到同様的新生！」接着一陣掌聲。</p>
<p>校長的女兒又說道：「我已經列好了一張表，現在可以發給諸位。那表上列着國貨可以替代外貨的名目，諸位可以照表上的名目買到極好的國貨。並且希望從今天起，一律改用國貨。以前買的外貨，諸位或者把牠抛棄，或者用完後方才改用國貨。這様才可以盡婦女在婦女國貨年的責任。校長的女兒宣佈散會後，大家又回到宿舍去了。她們有大部分的人，把外貨都封存起來，放在一間屋子裏，外面寫著：「悔用外貨紀念。」讓男同學去參觀。這様一來，男同學也漸漸的改用國貨了。</p>
<p>兩星期之後，全學校的人，除了不能代替而必需的外，一律改用國貨了。大家都說着：「像校長的女兒那様，才有做領袖的資格！」</p>

<h3>昨大破英海軍</h3>
<p>最後十分鐘海軍崩潰</p>
<p>西聯甲組足球賽一幕</p>
<p>東華昨日戰英海軍於中華棒球塲、大破之、結果七對一、爲西聯足球甲組賽之一幕、上半時二對一、海軍頑强抗拒、直至最後之十分鐘、一敗不可收拾、其守門表演、殊有獨到之處、觀衆寥寥數百人而已、</p>
<p>海軍先開紀錄　海軍開球、　來勢並不稍弱、東華陣綫、大受其累、東華回攻、則以射門之不準確、掃興而歸、載已十五分鐘、海軍又來纒擾、直逼門前、幸救成角球、台維斯開來、落點殊準、在不曾經意之中、黑爾與漢特生二人、一哄而進、及陸守門得知、球已冲進矣、</p>
<p>東華大舉回攻　東華旣先失、於是全軍回攻、將海軍球門、下令包圍、球如砲彈猛下、以海軍守門之老到與射撃之不準備、始終不得入、此時球在中區、戴見處添、遠在右角、大可偷襲、於是一脚傳右、虞添飛身而去斜打左角、恰巧進門、成一比一、又十五分鐘、萬象華在左角對門直射、球從横木彈落、李蓉安隨脚撩入、上半時成二比一、</p>
<p>最後三十分鐘　下半時起、東華仍取包圍策略、在門前來來去去、周光中以屢次射而不中、怒從心起、大告奮勇、遂連中二球、成四比一、時距終局當餘十分鐘、海軍死守不再出、東華猛攻、仍不稍息、萬象華傳中、戴麟經一索而得、五比一、陳虞添挑過守門、恰巧落進門内、六比一、李蓉安再加一脚、七比一、此最後之十分鐘中、海軍竟一敗不可收拾、亦出意外中、</p>

<h3>桃花江是美人</h3>
<p>— 窩定</p>
<p>「桃花江是美人窩……」這是近代的一種名曲，各處都唱着的。桃花江在湖南益陽，那里大概出中國最美的女人，因爲山水好的緣故呢？抑是其他的緣故呢？</p>
<p>湖南人是很野蠻的一種民族，開化比四川或江浙遲，生性好鬥。但因爲好鬥的習性，各處革命的與反革命的，大多是湖南人，這麽一種民國的締造，湖南人要算出了很多的力量的。</p>
<p>然而我們現代許多摩登男女呦呦的哼着這歌曲時，那裏知道其中的大悲苦呢？湖南人不是連年在外面打仗麽？「可憐無定河邊骨，猶是春閨夢裏人」這兩句詩，剛剛描寫了這一種現狀。現在桃花江流域，大點說湘資沅澧各江流城，男的大半爲枯骨了，而若干若干女人呵！還在作夢，希望她們的男人作了官回來，或者有點生路。</p>
<p>戰爭是否應有，這兒無需討論。但這現狀是値得注意的。人民是野草似的滋生，野草似的奄滅。死了的是不必說的，因爲轉輪之說，究竟也是悠渺之談，但所謂「孑遺」者如之何呢？有什麽方法可以消除减少，這多量的「人間苦」—貧窮，無告，傷慘—呢？養呵！敎呵！建設呵！可减去了這一毫髮麽？</p>
<p>這現狀是各處如此的，不過於湖南尤爲顯然。這時如有能「望氣」者，他該望到那兒到處黑氣漫天，消不盡的窮苦，悽凉，哀怨！但我們高興唱「桃花江是美人窩」！……而且還編製成了西洋的跳舞曲哩！　　跳舞其實是好的，美人也是好的，但是不要使男子化爲一無定河邊骨」，也許還更好些！「超度」也是好的，做做佛事也無妨，但與其注意死者的死後，不若稍稍注意坐者的生活！</p>
<h3>木魚</h3>
<p>— 白燕</p>
<p>從蓮花山狹窄的山徑曲折的繞入去，走不到數十級，便可以瞧見一幢巍峨的廟宇。那—就是蓮花庵。在院宇的週圍，叢生着密密的修竹，當陽光把竹影篩在壁上，便形成了一幅天然的圖案。景色是頗清幽的。</p>
<p>廟裏祭祀的祗是觀音大士；除此而外，還有一些别的神像。不過這些神像都是處在「附庸」的地位。寺内除一老尼凈心外，就祗有一少尼慧明。在這冷寞的蓮花庵内，師徒們靜度着孤寂的時日。</p>
<p>慧明是從小便被送入庵裏的。據說：當慧明穉年，她父母因貪慕李鄉紳的富有，冒然把女兒配給他的兒子。可是，在他們訂婚還不到兩年，男的却患「童子癆」死了。那時，關於她以後的處置，她夫家也並没什麽提議，但她父親却認爲「好馬不喫回頭草，好女不嫁二夫郎」。好像他們這様的書香世家，倘若女兒不能從一而終，是頗爲可恥的；竟硬生生把她送入庵去。</p>
<p>在慧明這方面：幼小時，也許受不過佛門的岑寂：茹素的枯澀：猙獰的偶像也許曾使她感到畏懼，但這都是祗限於肉體上的苦痛。而精神上，却尙怡然。</p>
<p>後來，在悽凉的木魚聲中，她年齒也逐漸的增長。現在，她已是一個二十歲的少女了。由於生理上的變化，她也漸漸地感到精神上的苦悶。尤其是當回家省親時，目覩弟弟矣婦唱隨之樂，以及他們永恒的笑臉，心頭便深深感到不快，並且痛切地覺出自已的落寞。她自問：「這是爲什麽呢？」想着，淚水便濕潤了眼沿。……</p>
<p>這時，她盤坐在蒲團上，手掌合在胸前。和着師傳的誦經聲：並還不絕地敲撃着木魚。她斜睨了師傳一眼，見她正垂視着地下：同時癟着的嘴唇也迅速地顫動着。她復懶懶地將眼光凝到木魚上。當槌子撃在上面時，便聞到清脆的響聲，這聲音可以一直傳播到山下。</p>
<p>孤寂的聲音，孤寂的生涯，交織成一愁苦的網；沉重地籠罩着她脆弱的心。她這時已昏昏地入於冥想的狀態。當她偶然把頭抬起，瞥見神龕内肉身裝金的菩薩時，心頭更劇烈的振動了。熱淚也撲簌簌地沿頰流下。</p>
<p>她敲撃的木魚聲漸漸遲鈍了。</p>
<h3>懷大金塔</h3>
<p>— 岳萌</p>
<p>在向仰光奔馳的火車上，首先看見高標於綠蔭叢中，遠遠就對旅人露出一臉微笑的，是你的姿影呵，大金塔！在離仰光馳往印度洋的輪船上，回頭來大都市的輪廓已經消失了，却突然望見聳立藍空，彷彿依依惜别的，也是你的姿影呵，大金塔！這些我都記得，但尤令我永遠不會忘掉的，是當黄昏之際，落日掛在你的腰畔，羣鴉都從菩提蔭中噪起，散在晚紅的西空，旋成點點的黑星，飛舞在你的身邊，這時呵，遥見你那慵倦的様子，唉，怎様地使人起着興亡的感慨！或是深夜散步於綠綺湖畔，望着你通身圍着燦爛的珠光，湖水裏也映着你柔和的金影，那滿透出舞女要赴夜會似的神情，又怎様地令人感到高興和怡悅！</p>
<p>如今你的足下，大理石鋪就的道上，那些獻花獻香的盛况，還是一如當年的麽？那些着白衣花裙的善男信女，被我呌做拜金主義者的，還是當着晴美的節日，在你下邊且歌且舞，興趣不减於往昔的麽？主張暴力革命絕食死在獄中的僧人巫威塞牙，在你身邊舉行火葬的悲壯日子，你還記得麽？喊着Simongoback的行列，通過了繁華的都市，繞到你的足下，散成頭顱的海波，作着祈禱和演講的示威日子，你還記得麽？五千印度碼頭工人的大罷工，弄到整個都市都成了死滅的悽愁景况，而你那裏的香花，也顯出了從來未有的暗淡様子，你還記得麽？大金塔呵，這些我都記得的，而且令我很是懷念的。</p>
<p>請你抬頭替我望望，那些點綴在金色稻田中的茅屋，是否還在冒出血紅的火冠，烏黑的烟柱？那些閃現於綠色森林中的棕黄面影，是否還在把畫有神和蛇的白旗，繼續地豎了起來？一别三年的大金塔呵，請你提起足尖，爲我望一望吧。</p>
<h3>關於「烙印」（續）</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>然而，這幾年來，中國農村的破産，日甚一日，臧克家自然會注意到這一點。但是，因爲缺乏社會的認識之故，他未能現實主義地把農民生活詠諸詩歌。他歌詠「難民」，「炭鬼」，「神女」，「漁翁」，「洋車夫」，「當爐女」，「販魚郎」等等，可是他始終没有把握住那些人的生活與心理。他把每一個形象，當作象徵，而唯美地，描寫出來。把「難民」籠罩在頽廢的冥暗的雰圍氣中，他没有正面地如實地把他們的生活拿給我們看。他只是用他的狹小的人道主義，朦朦朧朧地瞅着他們。他没有指示出難民同農村崩潰的關係。而在「老馬」「神女」「當爐女」「販魚郎」等作中他主觀地放入了他的堅忍主義的哲學。他没有客觀地就着那些現實的形象分析他們的心理，而只是普遍地把自已的情感給他們各各裝入。這是不合現實的。爲着克服此點，這位青年詩人宜抛開自已的空洞的窄狹的哲學，破開小的自我的硬殼，作一番切實研究社會的苦工夫。因爲，不能認識社會，所以把苦痛磨難看成美的形象，而說：</p>
<p>同時你又怕克服了牠，</p>
<p>來一陣失却對手的空虚。（「生活」）這是欣賞主義的態度。也就是由於這種態度，他把「炭鬼」描寫爲一件美術品了：</p>
<p>他們的臉是暗夜的天空，</p>
<p>汗珠給它流上條銀河，</p>
<p>放射光亮的一雙眼睛，</p>
<p>像兩個月亮在天空閃爍。（「炭鬼」）</p>
<p>但是，詩人的自收主義的要求，使他觀念地想到「奇怪的天火」。（「天火」），</p>
<p>使他想到「暗夜的長翼底下，伏着一個光亮的晨曦」。（「不久有那麽一天」。）因爲他看見了：</p>
<p>一個少女換不到一頓飯吃，</p>
<p>人肉和猪肉一様上了市。（「天火」）</p>
<p>從奇蹟他想到奇蹟了。可是，什麽是奇蹟呢？</p>
<h3>南歸雜記（續）</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>（五）新年雜要</p>
<p>碼頭上的檢查員不准陰陽合刊的日曆登岸，在我是不敢不佩服的。但這兒卻又連公安局長也忙着在拜年！</p>
<p>據說去年，陰曆在這兒一様不通行，連見面道喜也還得低聲兒。現在呢，放邊炮是不消說，有些人家的門前還貼上「皇恩春浩蕩」一類的春聯！</p>
<p>龍船燈也是新年雜要之一。每一班裏有二只龍船燈，多的時候要十幾個人，絲絃樂器全齊備，唱些時新的小調，每天倒也可以做十幾千錢。但今年因爲時勢壞，龍船燈又多，據說是要打些折扣了。</p>
<p>龍船燈以外，最普遍的，卻要推和尙戲了。這是只要有四五個孩子就行的，每個孩子都用一個假面具；三個是和尙，一個是女香客。從進廟燒香起，到和尙通姦止，二分鐘就可以演完。就這麽沿户扮演着。　　鳳陽花鼓近年來已經不大看見，卻換了些要戲法的英雄了。把口劍兒呑下肚去，留着劍柄在嘴外，直着肚子呌。錢一到手，就拔出劍兒往他家去。　　此外還有玩馬燈，背黄龍等等的把戲。</p>
<p>造成新年熱閙的另一原因，應該是賭。因爲在平日，倘不是有錢有勢的紳士，凡屬賭博，一律禁止的。但新年裏卻有五天可以放任，在我們那兒呌做「五日王」，意思是在這五天裏可以像封王那麽自由。</p>
<p>新年還眞是孩子們的世界。他們在大年夕就從長輩那裏拿到了壓歲錢，元旦一到，換上簇新的衣服，在家看燈，上街買玩具。窮孩子卽使得不到這些，但至少也可以少挨些打駡呢。</p>
<p>在這一方面，陰曆也許有一天眞會廢去，而孩子們的快樂該是永恒的。</p>

<h3>書話（續）</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>基於藏書家的自私與自秘，以及兵火災害，無數名書秘笈，往往永久消蝕，實爲一大恨事。所以，在另一方面言之，「秘書之罪高於焚書」。李清（映碧）曰：「弟居恒自念，謂世人秘書之罪，高於焚書。誠見此書一秘，或剝於鼠，或殘於蠶魚，或飄零於兒婢之風輪線帖，不傳則絕矣。因歎抱朴子數卷，猶流傳至今者，當不以伯喈帳中之秘爲功，而以從伯喈帳中抱去數卷者之爲功也。弟與年翁皆欲爲其抱者，故有書必借，有借必抄，有抄必還。息壤在彼，當永堅斯約，遍傳諸同志。愼勿效顰伯喈之言曰，惟我與爾共之，弗廣也。」這意見是極當珍重的，祗有此種方法，纔能使名著秘笈，能以永存於人世之問。</p>
<h3>暮（五）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>「妹妹，停停手不好麽，照這様又要引起頭痛。」</p>
<p>青松抬起頭來，暫時地把筆離開了素絹，倐然地有着含了孩子一様的喜悅的臉，但是迅速地又消失了，她靜靜地回答：</p>
<p>「就要完了，人高興就把一切都忘掉。」</p>
<p>她淺淺地笑着，青枝就走過來，看着她卽將完成的一幅觀音像，用清淡的色勾畫出來的，莊嚴而嫻靜的佛容，超超然地立在一片荷瓣之上。</p>
<p>「這不是算完了麽？」</p>
<p>「荷瓣還没有塡色呢，也要題上字。」</p>
<p>她把用過的筆在筆洗裏洗凈，調和着淺粉色，輕輕地抹着，然後用白水把近邊的地方描得更淡一些。她用了墨筆恭整地寫了「青松沐手恭繪」這幾個字，纔舒適地躺在圈身椅裏。</p>
<p>「我眞歡喜這幅畫，妹妹，我最愛手裏拿着的那一枝凈柳。」</p>
<p>「那是來超度人間苦難的。」</p>
<p>「若是那些没有苦難也没有快樂的人呢？」</p>
<p>「那，呵，那，——那就該忍受下去好了！」</p>
<p>青松幽幽然的，像已經脫塵的人，她的眼睛凝然地望了窗外在秋風中搖擺的楊樹。</p>
<p>「我來吹一支曲子吧。」</p>
<p>青枝說過把懸在墻上的簫取下來。</p>
<p>「我怕姊姊又覺得喫力了。」</p>
<p>「不會的，我很高興，我來吹一節昭君怨，好麽？」</p>
<p>青枝試吹兩聲，就坐到近窗的椅子上，她那瘦弱的身形，如遲暮的老人一様，徐緩而低暗的簫聲，悠悠地起來了。</p>
<p>這全然是在大沉默之中，幾乎連呼吸都靜止了，簫聲裏可以尋出來千古難補的哀怨，就能幻想到那麽一個絕色的佳人，寂寞寡歡地在那裏垂淚，帳外有向南捲去的風。她羨慕着青草能每年綠一回，她也羨慕着長着翅膀的鳥可以飛到所願去的地方，但是她自已，要冷寂寂地，來度過這一生。</p>
<p>在吹奏的時候，青枝的眼睛漸漸地爲一層淚蒙住了，她想强自容忍着，更張大了眼睛；可是那淚水却癢癢地從頰上淌下來。</p>

<p>昨　商證劵交易所、市面比較稍形活動、大體上仍未說盤旋狀况、市塲稍有無從證實之謠言、惟不足發生影響、但多方稍見虚軟、市價略有轉疲之象、盤旋醖釀、爲期已久、此等現象、尙非正式變動、大户形勢、堅壁清野、塲上四號雖係買進、爲數有限、五號雖係賣出、亦不踴躍、交易仍以散户進出、比較熱鬧、成交漸見增加、或能卽此漸漸活動、市價當有較大之升降、刻下形勢、暫仍看疲、但亦無多大跌風也、昨日上午開盤、四號略有需要、檯面賣户比較爲湧、五號亦有賣出、市價一路回疲一二角、次盤散户略有求售、依然疲軟、大概仍小一角左右、雖仍係盤旋狀態、但已比較活動、人心大概略帶疲軟、午後仍未有轉機、開收兩盤、多數未有高低、餘亦漲跌互見、仍係一角左右盤旋、收盤二十關遠期好二角半爲最多、市價結果、計一致跌落五分至二角半不等、成交總數計共七百七十三萬元、現貨未有做開、茲將其高低漲跌、比較列表於後、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>紐約公司債劵又登新高峯</h3>
<p>新豐洋行十三日報告云、紐約股市先因弗辣邱之撫恤金提案混沌、市况上落不定、無趨勢可言、末後因鐵路貨運及其他商業報告良好、鐵道股及煤油等乃稍漲、小交易所中煤油股與公用股頗有需要、公司債券又登新高峯、美國及外國公債亦較前堅定、惟德國公債不振、全日成交一百二十七萬股、（小麥）高價不克維持、投機家乃轉抛賣、消息無關緊要、（棉花）先因退伍軍人案及白銀案引起膨脹空氣而漲、實則此二提案皆少通過之可能、復興局提議紗廠工作每週三十小時、廠方及買者頗感不安、致高價時多頭脫手、欲購者鵠候較大反動、茲將道瓊斯指數列後、　　收盤價　較前日</p>

<h3>减工有可能說標紗漲風益盛</h3>
<p>紗市趨堅、漲風益熾、以一般散空往時視局景不佳、羣向抛出、因此一遇良好消息、反動愈覺激烈、今日廠商爲維持廠基起見、午後三時、召集各廠討論團結辦法、大致共同合作、維持紗市、或者有减工可能、於是消息傳出、一般空頭活動抵補、買風突盛、據一部份調查、外商在標準市塲抛出有三萬多包之說、所以老標紗尙有一度劇烈之變化、</p>
<h3>標紗高漲兩元許</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以外棉平平、但塲中新賣户缺乏、抵補者反多、市盤趨漲、各月漲二·四·六·七·八·九·角、午後買氣殊濃、漲風尤激、各月漲一元三·七·角、全日成交統計四萬五千六百包、查賣出同孚一千一百五十包、源大一千九百包、信誠一千六百五十包、明德一千六百包元泰一千一百包、錦昌八百包、仁豐八百包、買進永昌一千六百五十包、森康一千三百包、愼昌一千包、惠康一千九百五十包、福大一千零五十包、長豐二千八百五十包、恊生八百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下　　最高價　最低價　收盤價　漲　跌　存賬數三月　一八二·九　一八０·四　一八二·七　漲一·九　四０、０五０四月　一八三·五　一八一·０　一八三·一　二·二　七七·七００五月　一八二·０　一八０·二　一八一·九　二·一　二三、四五０六月　一八一·八　一八０·０　一八一·八　二·三　一九、五五０七月　一八一·九　一八０·四　一八一·九　二·一　一七、七五０八月　一八二·二　一八０·七　一八二·一　一·九　二０、八五０總計　一九九、一五０</p>

<h3>標花多頭意興不濃</h3>
<p>棉市晨疲午漲、但形勢尙屬萎靡、因印棉趨勢不振、而紗廠有减工之說、故做多頭者意味甚澹、市勢較紗市爲疲、市上現棉交易異常沉悶、不過美棉市况尙平靜、棉市前途、殊缺把握、</p>
<h3>鄭標後市轉好</h3>
<p>標花前市開盤、隨外不佳而疲、各月漲跌五分至一角半、午後以紗市漲風激烈、致棉市帶起、各月漲一角半、全日成交統計五萬二千三百担、查賣出賡豐三千八百担、愼昌四千七百担、仁豐二千四百担、信誠三千七百担、新亨一千一百担、吉豐一千八百担、同孚一千一百担、大豐一千八百担、源大一千三百担、惠康二千三百担、買進長豐六千三百担、森康二千七百担、椿記一千八百担、恊生三千四百担、德記二千一百担、恒德一千六百担、泰興一千担、振大一千担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>湘省出清存紗辦法</h3>
<p>積紗六千餘件之多</p>
<p>在未出清前不辦貨</p>
<p>湖南長沙積有二十支及十六支兩項棉纱六千餘件、銷路疲滯、本月八日、湖南省棉紗管理所舉行第一次所商聯席會議、由所長楊伯衡主席、當經議决（一）十六支及二十支兩項棉紗、由管理所通知各商、自本日（八日）起暫行停止辦貨進口、一俟將來該項存紗暢銷後、再召集會議另議辦法、（二）各紗商在會議日以前、所向滬漢各廠定購之十六支及二十支兩項棉紗、未起運者、應將定貨證據、（如滬漢各處來電及號信定單八類）限於本月十日止、持向管理所分别存記經管理所查明屬實、方准作效、逾期概不登記、（三）各纱商在滬漢各廠購辦之十六支及二十支棉紗已經起運在途者、限於本月十五日止、一律裝運進口、但已由管理所騐明證據、又經存記有案、確係會議日以前所定之貨、不在此限、否則概不登記、（四）凡二十支及十六支兩項棉紗、應儘先將本市積存之貨推銷、如甲項商標纱支銷完、卽以乙項同一支數紗支補銷、未經第二次會議通過、不得向滬漢各廠定辦任何商標同一支數之貨、（五）本市十六支及二十支紗價在停辦進口期内、應依照本市紗業同業公會根據滬漢行情逐日所議之市價爲標凖、不得任意漲落、壟斷居奇、（六）如有違反以上各條者、均由管理所將該項紗支全數查存、俟第二次聯席會議時再行解决、</p>
<h3>津市日紗銷路甚暢</h3>
<p>津訊本市棉紗交易、進户胃口尙佳、市氣仍平、高陽帮買四十二支水月兩股紗價二百七十六元五角、三十二支三松二百二十八元、十六支松鶴紗一百七十三元五角、香河帮買二十支鴻禧紗一百七十三元、十支三光紗一百五十二元、泊頭帮買十六支長壽紗一百七十四元、窩洛沽帮買十六支仙桃紗一百七十二元五角、</p>
<h3>美棉呆滯無特色</h3>
<p>昨日美棉市况、呆滯無特色、同業態度觀望、始因利物浦消息良好而漲、後以南方售出回疲、結果現貨跌五磅音、期貨跌一磅音至四磅音、利物浦棉現貨漲五點、期貨漲六點、埃及棉現貨不動、孟買棉市、始因多頭了結及投機家賣出而跌、後以空頭抵補回漲、結果平加爾漲二羅比二角半、奥姆辣漲一羅比半、白羅溪漲一羅比、原電錄左、（十三日電）</p>

<h3>糧食業外空頭暢補期粉</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼俏之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大均小二三角左右故開價時市氣曾見平軟、後以廠家仍互擯不抛、業外空頭、則逐步抵進、因出少進多之故、人心爲之帶起、迨至下午開盤、市情仍續見佳、以交易雖未大暢、但業外空頭、則仍暢補、並以大廠意欲維持、仍無出檔、致市塲人心、續爲帶振、不過北路客帮、因銷塲未活、依然回出也、結果本月份較前日好一分半、四月份好一分二厘半、五六七月份好二分、八月份跌一分半、</p>
<h3>近期麥突跌七八分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面呈近期大落、遠則平穏之象、洋麥　價、芝加哥坎拿大均小二三角左右、但人心方面、尙未十分注意、其後忽受刺激、殆因事實上不能再事抬價也、因本月份之軋漲、初因無貨之故、前日因有其號套售洋麥、致無力多頭、一致放棄、市面遂忽髴落、上午開價四元一角、下午一角尙無人受可見抬價之無意識也、遠期交易不多、價尙平定、結果本月份較前日暴落八分、四月份跌七分、八月份爲一分、現麥市面、仍見穏俏、高擋貨較前又好五分不等、開蚌埠麥三元六角一分頴州麥三元六角半、瑤灣麥三元六角半、山東麥三元六角八分、南宿州麥三元六角七分、計二千五百元、由福新華豐辦去云、</p>
<h3>河下米到頭轉湧</h3>
<p>厚粳再跌五分…陰元跌近角</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、因日前風雨阴隔、昨已天時晴正、悉數蒞至、抵埠者非常擁擠、計有八九十號、（萬餘石）、中以厚粳及各花色居多、晚稻約占近四十號、去路方面、本街店胃雖較旺、但當斯久疲之後、形勢終見平常、兼之來源驟湧庶幾難免有過求之慨、因之如常帮蘇同南港等粳市况垂軟、行情貶去五分、至於青角松泗西練等晚稻來貨雖亦不少、幸南北洋兩帮納意頗濃、故初市起手栗落、直至收市、未見若何退色、計共納進三千四五百包、售方乘機喊高、結果又以客家吃盤嚴緊、呈平定之局、杜洋尖到銷相仿、亦無榮辱陰元到貨較夥、去路不廣、市色疲軟近尺、變元貨乏、反帶秀色、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮到船三十二三號、市上各貨去胃尙有、白粳柆尖跌落近角、早薄稻高貨定局、中次亦疲數分、羊埠客尖白元陰元定立、</p>
<h3>客秈步漲一角</h3>
<p>閩浙辦胃甚貪</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况到頭不旺、客化甚暢、市氣緊張、人心向上、高次各擋一律上騰、較之前市漲起七八分至一角二三分不等、高貨尤見居奇、且客帮辦胃甚香、預料尙有繼續暢辦之必要、昨福州胃口最佳、辦去江西機晚一千包、湖南機油機靖一千包、明光糙米一千包、泉州去機紅與徐州機秈各一千包、糙紅三百包、寗波去皂市沙市糙一千五百包、南京糙三百包、温州去機早三百五十包、本街去機糙米四百多包、無錫機元則由福州去五十包、統日開出七千八百八十包、大米由閩省辦去閩省泉福州胃口仍貪、今明或有繼續辦裝、故其市面尙在看好也、</p>
<h3>黄豆市面平庸</h3>
<p>昨日黄豆市况活絡、但實銷尙難發展、雖一度被餅銷帶起、終以貨厚而賤售、人心難堅、昨日售價、比較前市無大出入、計廠家辦出頴州豆六七車、價自二元五角二至五角、又蚌埠豆三車、價爲二元四角半至四角、又碭山豆千餘包、價爲二元五角二至四角八、餘外歸德豆·肥河豆及正陽關豆等四五車、由内地本街分去云、</p>
<h3>糖市國産片青大批運到</h3>
<p>昨糖市公會劃盤如二四粗砂白仍十九元六角三、略有成交、太古糖與本廠綿白價與昨同、國産雙蓋白開過數十包、價爲十七元、惠州赤開百餘包、價十三元五角五分、潮青上擋略有開出、價自十一元七角至十一元三四角、廣東片青昨由太古公司之新到輪運到八千餘箱、市象轉鬆、昨開二百餘箱、價九元、</p>
<p>南北貨</p>
<h3>金山枝銷滯價跌</h3>
<p>粤産金山圓枝近以來源絡繹、而銷路現反平淡、故號盤又鬆、日前聞廣帮開出百數箱、價比前降落三四元有奇、上擋如瑞昌牌生曬枝亦不過開七十五元、菊花米如全黄高貨、申底早罄、復以到源久斷、故市俏價騰、現市若大粒全黄無沙者可兌四十元、昨聞號家方面得産區函訊、已有裝途、大約不日可到、預料届時必有供不應求之勢、</p>
<h3>油市柏油售盤日跌</h3>
<p>柏油自各産地一再跌價後、市面竟致一　不振、而到貨漸見旺盛、近日漢市已跌開麻城油每擔十五元、各帮辦者寥落、供過於求、雖跌至此價、已爲數年來所無、然皂廠尙嫌價大、用不合算、所賴燭淘所用、究屬有限、且鄂西一帶如産地積貨尙多、故市情仍趨疲勢、本埠行家因見春銷零落、均不願多備、因客貨所到、亦未開出、售盤隨步低落、計名重荆每擔二十元○四五角、平荆二十元、麻城每擔十八元云、</p>
<h3>花生油到貨銜接</h3>
<p>—去路不旺—</p>
<p>花生油市况、以豆油之不振、市氣亦趨下游、且近日來源絡繹、存貨堆積、去路惟浙省尙有交易、但價格低限、迄昨始擯開、市價比較上週須跌八角、計開泊兒油一千件、價爲九元、夾倉油二千件、價爲八元八角、輕皮油二千件　價爲八元四角、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<h3>紐約生絲銷路漸少</h3>
<p>（上月份不滿四萬包）　本埠生絲出口公會、昨接紐約絲業公會電報、大致謂紐約各絲織廠雖均開織春季絲織品、奈因世界潮流、以及時尙所趨、類均側重人遺絲、致生絲銷用益少、上月（卽二月）份紐約全市絲織廠共祗銷用中日意法等國生絲三萬九千○二十一包、日本絲佔百分之九十强、華絲不滿一千包、較諸一月分計减一千九百三十三包云、</p>
<p>（絲廠長吐來源稍暢）　無錫各絲廠以春繭轉瞬孵育、手中執有餘繭者紛紛租廠繅絲、是以　歷新正以來、相繼開工者又增三四家、長吐産額漸增來源稍暢、最近半個月中無錫絲廠長吐巴共裝到八十六件云、</p>
<p>兩年中廢絲輸出比較）　我國黄白絲及絲繭下脚、（海關統稱廢絲）在出口貨中亦占重要位置、每歲輸往歐美各國計有六七萬担、近年來受日本絲屑（卽廢絲）及人造絲等侵銷影響、廢絲輸出一落千丈、茲查本年度自去歲六月一日至今年三月十日止、共計輸出廢絲一萬九千九百零一担、上年度同時期内計一萬九千二百五十九担、較增六百四十二担、</p>
<p>（廠灰經祗有補空交易）　歐美絲織廠春季絲織品銷用仍减、而日絲績極傾銷、華絲廠銷仍無起色、滬埠美莊等祗有補空交易、計連納等進白廠經三十包、灰經十包、價仍平疲、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談造林運動</h3>
<p>— 柳岸</p>
<p>以前咱們中國的植樹節是在清明日，現在已經改在孫總理逝世紀念日，而且植樹節擴而大之曰造林運動日，這是「民族復興」的明顯標識。在這一全國都在舉行造林運動的時候，報紙復有造林運動特刊，宣傳鼓勵，氣象萬新。</p>
<p>有位大學敎授發表文章以爲在這農村破産之時，唯一救濟辦法就是造林。他的主張約有三點，</p>
<p>（一）生産量逐年加增而且穏定</p>
<p>（二）减少農民向都市中跑</p>
<p>（三）謀水利根本的改進</p>
<p>上面三條的陳述，就可以明白到林業的功效，能使生産量加增而穏定，能使農民中的失業者日漸减少，能使水利根本的改善。這三種，是目前農村急需解决的問題。不謀生産量加增而穏定，農民就不能飽食暖衣；不謀農民中的失業者日漸减少，農民就得爲社會上的作惡分子；不謀水利的根本改善，終至於免不掉水旱頻仍；所以解决這三大問題就是救治農村。要完成解决這三大問題則非林業不爲功。所以總起來說，林業就是救治農村惟一的生路。現在正是植樹節季，望大家抖擻精神合力做植樹的工作，使國内的荒山空地，完全變爲森林之區。救亡圖存，在此一舉。</p>
<p>這一種「救亡圖存在此一舉」的貢獻策，自然是國民政府要加以注意的；如果復興農村委員會亦以這一獻策採爲决議，從林業這一着雷厲風行以救治農村復興農村，那末，「救亡圖存」或者可以成功，然我們却未敢完全贊同，試問全國的山地如十八年内玫部統計司調查的總面積五百六十七萬萬一千三百萬三千六百八十九畝裏頭，難道都是荒山空地，而没有樹林的嗎？每年農民靠那種山地的樹林（爲桑樹菓樹等）及農産物以爲生活者正不知凡幾，可是山地的出産品　不是與田地約出産品一様地要納損付稅，如果農民要從事林業，試問山地有的是官産有的是大地主私有産，農民那裏來的錢去租，或買山地以造林？如果是鼓勵大地主從事林業的話，自然的「遇了凶惡的年頭」他們就可以在所在的林地裏做林間工作或種植或採伐或搬運或製造」以收其利了，可是農民「都可以儘量的收容」做工的話那可就難說。而且木材的市塲在這百業不景氣的現在，就是大地主以森林，爲出産大僱農民做工以採伐，也不一定能够得利。大地主鐵算盤一打，誰都不願意幹這虧本的事了。那末，就使全國的荒山空地都廣爲森林之區，農民那裏能够有工可做，而使農民中的失業者日漸减少。那未所謂」林業就是救治農村惟一的生路」？所謂「救亡圖存在此一舉」者，恐理由並不充分。</p>
<p>惟造林乃水利的根本辦法却是應該附和提倡以觀克成。</p>
<h3>原來……「他的煩悶？」</h3>
<p>— 符</p>
<p>這幾天。友們看到阿驥的神情非常的消極頽唐。精神上又恍惚。倦態。態度亦轉變得多了。他—什麽都懶得去動彈，似乎在一月以前的情形，舉止與行動完全兩様了。有時候。祇見他獨個兒踱踱方步，頻頻嘆息。雙眉緊縐着。看來。有一件心事兒在他的心坎上難以告訴人的様子，本來，處在這個社會裏，年青人們所感到的一種苦煩無非是出路問題。不過，像阿驥這様的人，有合意的職業。有良好的環境，况且，家庭裏的一切負擔亦不負重任的，言様的苦悶，總引以爲不解。</p>
<p>一天，老張同着我，看完了電影，要我去望望他的近狀，我們走進他的臥室，看見他兀坐在椅上對着天發呆。</p>
<p>於是，老張在他的背後輕輕的問他一句。</p>
<p>「喂！阿驥！這幾天怎麽啦？」</p>
<p>「噢！很好……多天不見了，您們從那裏來？」他突然間在背後聽到聲音，很驚惶似的回答，同時，流露着勉强的笑。</p>
<p>「我們特地來拜望，拜望你的。」</p>
<p>「多謝，多謝。」</p>
<p>「您近來做些什麽消遣啊，」</p>
<p>「没什麽，坐着懶得動，什麽事情都感不到興味兒反正，這様的消磨光陰，我覺得很値得，一他說完，嘆了一口沉重的氣息。</p>
<p>老張想。探問他爲什麽消極，懶動，希望他，講出來，或者，友門可以在精神上安慰他少許，所以他又問：</p>
<p>「我請問您，近來雝女士怎様，聽說，您們愛情熱度很高，想來，不久可成事實吧！」</p>
<p>「不必提起了，女人我恨極，因了，女人我便弄得這様的消極，雝女士麽，已同另一個男子訂婚了。反天，女人，像水一様的流動，誰能永遠這様的相愛呢？」他聳了聳肩。表示無限慨嘆，　　「唉！四五年的友誼戀愛，會變卦。怪不得，阿驥的消極是必然的事實」我同情底說：</p>
<p>「哈！原來，他的煩悶是失戀」老張才明瞭。（不受酬）</p>
<h3>關於哭</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>人，是藝術式的，無論在行動，思想，外觀，内心種種方面看去，都有够發噱的地方，都有够高超的藝術成分。比方「哭」這種内心的表情，就是個很好的例子慢慢地談來，足够拉成一篇千字左右的文章。</p>
<p>嬰孩告别母胎，落地一聲「哭」，有人說，那便是第一聲哭出「人生的痛苦」爲什麽不先有别的表情呢？雖說那是種天賦的本能、實實也是近於「痛苦說」這種的「哭」，是眞情的表露，所以常被大了的人回憶與憬憧。然而人大了，也還會「哭」。</p>
<p>昔年的中國，五六歲的女孩，將興蓄辫纒足，蓄辫的害處雖多，但痛苦却彷彿說不出來。只有纒足，則是誰都不能否認的一種女人特有的，「痛苦」，没個不被纒得「哭」的；但任憑你哭天哭地，在那時候，足是非纒不可。</p>
<p>男孩子呢，也有種「哭」，便是上私墊　蒙，總是哭個不停的，這種哭是有點菓明其醬油，也是中國過去的敎育的一個簡明的特寫。</p>
<p>再長大一些，那又不同了。比方死了什麽親人，女後輩大都哭得很起勁，最是在開奠時，禮生呌一聲舉哀，女人們則齊聲大哭，簡直有些像音樂隊，這種哭，未免有些機械，虚僞。其次不免於哭的一幕的，便是在出閣的時候，擁上花團錦簇的彩轎，没有不眼淚簌簌，哭得那麽幽默這，爲什麽要哭，眞要問新娘自已才知道。</p>
<p>在男人方面，也有哭的人和哭的時候，比方白面書生，歷届應試，每塲自已都覺得自已的文章撰得很好，却往往有人考到花甲年齡，紅頂子還没有撈上頭蓋。這時，據說除了一面仰屋興嗟，痛駡考官没有眼睛外，一面則是痛哭着自家的墳山不靈。其次是娶進的妻子，若是單會生女孩，續納的妾，也又如此，那麽？想及後嗣乏續，也不免要大哭而特哭。</p>
<p>以上算是舊時代，舊社會那關於哭的種種。說到現在的新社會，哭原來也還一様的風行。新式仕女，頗有幾種哭法，比方失了戀，或是丈夫新死，往往哭得很厲害。但也就在哭的當兒，往往受接着新情人的愛，這許是新式女子之所以新，她們的情種原是那麽動盪，哭容易發生，也容易消滅。最是在丈夫面前要挾一件事，而不能達到目的，一施用「哭」的手腕，便有圓滿解决的希望，這，算是她們的「哭的撒嬌」。或則是所適非人，而自已却那麽縹緻，男人兒是個土老哥，彩鳳隨鴉，是不免要背着人哭。或則是憑鏡發現自已的青春消逝了，當年擇配標凖過於苛刻，這時追逐的男子却漸漸地稀少了，清夜孤枕，定多痛心的哭。</p>
<p>這些，我們都看不出什麽意義來，只有女人們在臨産時，因爲挨受不了那種産的痛苦，所逼出的哭，那確是偉大的，値得頌揚。</p>
<p>說到一般青年紳士們，也像舊時代的人一様愛哭，不過所哭的略略有些變易。比方爲失戀而哭，是青年們最普遍的哭，甚至有在熱戀之中而哭者。撈不到博士碩士頭銜，或則失業打流，那倒是不致哭的。什麽「國難臨頭」，更不會引志他們一絲的「哭素」，卽使有哭的，也是假的，沽名釣譽的。只彷彿在報紙上看過紀述，有是有某種大人先生在演講時「聲淚俱下」，那誠然是曾哭過，…</p>
<p>我覺得：哭有些玄妙，而且没意義，卽使是人類不能免的表情，我也想眞正的「哭」，眞正的淚，是應爲着人類大衆。進一步，我們所期望的，人類不該有哭，有淚，只應有力，有血。</p>
<h3>給哭艾霞的人</h3>
<p>— 之</p>
<p>艾霞死去了好多時候了，許多報紙雜誌爲了紀念她底「生」和「死」，出了幾個專號，愛慕她底文人也不知洒了多少同情的血淚。更因她底一死而刺激了上海社會若干少男少女的心情，追問着艾霞自死的前因後果，也同様在探索着人生究竟爲何！</p>
<p>我很驚訝艾霞之死會比她底生更有轟動社會的力的，因爲我看見了許多人的死，—自死，病死，飢寒交迫而死，枉死（包括流血的死），這様死的男女老少，一天不知多少，然而他們或她們都是一死即了，并没有留給社會一個影子，也没有人爲他或她在報章雜誌上開過追悼會，爲什麽艾霞之死就不同於常人了呢？</p>
<p>這裏，我要請問那些「流淚爲文」紀念艾霞多文人們，那些報紙雜誌的編者們，你們這様爲艾霞之死而哭，而做文章，是否因爲她是藝術中人，她是當代明星，她是摩登美女子？如果是這様，是一種憐花惜玉的風流情調發動於心；作成文章，編成刊物，這様的事，那於死者，於社會，都是没有好處的。</p>
<p>人的死滅，無論怎様是應該同情的，艾霞之死，自然是人們應該同情的一個，而生人對於死：自然的死與人爲的死，或自死與他死，應該負着責任，這也是情理之事。這裏，我又要請問那些哭艾霞的人，你們也以同様的眼淚去哭别個死者嗎？</p>
<p>今日的人間，確是遭受着一個大刦運的時代，人人都在苦苦的生，苦苦的活，不能生，不能活，才有人甘心情願去死。近有許多人在討論自殺的問題，大家都只摸索着原故，而找不出一個阻止自殺的辦法，這找不出辦法的原因，卽是社會没有一個阻止自殺的力産生出來，卽社會没有一個彼此聯繋的帶，人都是散着不相痛癢之關的。</p>
<p>這散着不相痛癢之關的人間，斷絕了生存的聯繋之帶，我們試舉眼一望黄浦灘頭的死者，大都是舉手無援，舉目無親，以致失去了生存之信念，不得不飲恨而死的。更推論到那些爲失戀而死的英靈，這些人之所以必死，那也是這個社會没有一個適當的事給他或她向另外一個方面發展之故，空虚着而憂鬱的人生，不自尋死，留在人間幹嗎？</p>
<p>擺在我們眼前的這個現實的社會，生存之慘苦到了絕頂，人與人之間没有聯繋，甚至人的德行，正義之氣等等，也全然消滅了，苦掙慘鬥的人生大劇，使得許多感情豐富，理想高尙的人不願意在這様的人間苟且偷生了。</p>
<p>討論自殺問題，要想對自殺提出有效的阻止的方法，那只有努力恢復人類生存的聯繋之帶，人與人之間，彼此痛癢相關，大家都生氣勃勃地抱着一個人類高尙生活的理想。若具體的說，那卽是努力改造現實社會，實現新的社會生活。</p>
<p>凡這些說話，歸根結底是要有一個力，是在如何打出一個領導社會前進的力量。</p>
<p>有好多人專朝向消極方面去表現一下就完了，這是最大的一個危機，幾篇文章把艾霞的生前死後，細細訴了一遍，讚美她的勇敢，讚美她的不平凡，這様的做法，無異是鼓動那些心存自死的人去貪奪這死後的榮譽，這些做文章的人更於無心之中做了自殺的說敎師。</p>
<p>爲艾霞之死而大哭，大紀念，那是不必的，而且我認爲這是社會輿情麻木不仁，才有這様的事！</p>
<p>我不同情艾霞的死，我時時只感到斷絕了人類生存聯繋之帶，是一件痛心的事，希望社會輿情，從此不再那様麻木不仁。</p>
<h3>第一次交際的失敗</h3>
<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>姑娘我愛你的純樸，你是從上海回來的，怎麽不給繁華點染了你？這才敎我敬佩呢！他倚着火車的門邊！把臉孔對着我，在隆隆作響的車聲中我聽見他這様說。我想他講了這麽一句話並不會稀奇，因爲當時我穿的的確是一件很素色的布長袍子，因此没有想到他會懷有别意，更不懂他所說的就是入手交識討好的辦法，在先雖然他經别人一次介紹給我。可是未經直接交談，這回在火車上是意外的相遇。</p>
<p>回到家裏，我没有把這件事記住。第天早上，門外來了郵人，那不是送信，是一包笨重的東西。我想在這鄉下地方誰會送禮物給我，東西的外觀是長方形的，在未拆開之前，我就猜到幾成，知道它是書籍。不錯，他寄來四本有名的小說給我。這倒很好，從這一次起，我打破了不愛看書的壞習慣。以後他照様陸續寄來，差不多有一個月之内，我可以收到五十部中外的名著。這様才迫得我没有法子，感到自已很不意思，很怕他來信向我討論到書裏面的問題，那麽我作答不出，不是太丢臉嗎？所以自已也用了一個方法勉勵自已，把各書籍排列到床前檯子上，限定每幾天必要讀完幾本。這様才慢慢的養成我看書的習慣。</p>
<p>自然，他對我有誠懇的指導。在通信上，自始至终没有談到感情上的話。他使我内心安靜，我高興他給我學識上的門徑，我接受了每一次他寄給我的書籍，當他是自已的親哥哥看待，寗可說是先生吧！</p>
<p>時間過去並不很久，我住在南京姑母的家裏，他來邀我上杭州去逛，黨時我也打算要到一個老同學那邊住幾天，所以答應和他同行。</p>
<p>火車到杭州是下半天的光景。我們想找家旅店整理自已的衣履，洗洗臉，吃點東西，才去看朋友。可是經過一踱休息之後，他說，「晚飯的時間到了，去找人不會不好意思嗎？還是明天清早去的好，我替你多開一個房間好了！」</p>
<p>第二天，我提了小皮篋，乘了黄包車上朋友那邊去、可是瞧着地址去找而屋裏的人並不是我所相識。這個驚異使我的心頭慌張，在人家門口站着，望了好些時候，没有法子祗得同他回到旅店。這時候，我覺得旅店是個可怕的地方，我不敢再在那兒停留，心裏很埋怨來錯了。於是坐在一隅不敢作聲，他温和的勸我去逛。不知道幾時之後，我找着自已坐在小舟上面，繞着湖心亭在動動蕩蕩的似乎使我頭暈又似乎很自在。</p>
<p>當晚，我不能睡覺，因爲從來没有和男人開過旅館，心裏好像犯了罪，怪不舒服，想回上海，又怕趕不及上南京的火車。多留一晚？這一晚我好給我太難過，而且我不信任他；雖然我們是住着不同的房間。</p>
<p>苦悶積滿了心頭，也許他正和我相反！晚飯，他奮興的渴了點酒，我找着他的眼睛已經在放出不平常的閃光，没有停秘的視綫傾斜在我的身上，他没有說話，房間裏在這一霎的空氣是嚴肅和可怕，這種沉靜使我擅抖，我純凈安寗的靈魂被他驚動。他眞的撲到我身邊說着：「妹妹，我的心裏在發燒呢！你應許……？」他擁緊我想作一個吻的嘗試吧！好在茶房適時的走進來。</p>
<p>因爲内心太不舒暢的原故，我没有回到姑母的地方，一直乘小車到自已家裏。</p>
<p>「怎麽的，家裏這様肅靜，都出去嗎？」我這様問着小丫頭，可是她並不回答。妹妹弟弟們跑出來看看我又跑了進去，這敎我發慌，不得不又勇敢的踏進父親床跟前，他兇得有似老虎的眼睛釘着我說：「你還回來幹什麽？」母親滿面淚痕，持着一封信給我看，原來，世間有這様奸險的男子！他寫信告訴我的父親說我愛上他，在杭州同宿于某旅店了。</p>
<p>算了，這也不算我是上當吧。檢好幾件衣服，我跑回上海，自已另外找生活。</p>

<h3>一家生命</h3>
<p>答：編者讀完了這封信後，發生了兩種感想，一是我國社會上紳士權威之炙手可熱，紳士是可以當做「職業」的，紳士是可以作惡的；二是陳君心上也覺得他的父親是應該「剷除」的，不過他一方面却又慶幸他父親能「得到些錢財」使他「自幼卽入學讀書」，並稱頌他能「造福（？）於社會—一家十多口的生活都賴他供給，」他爲了要維持他個人和家庭的生活，却想防止，避免，婢女母親告發他父親，希望他父親罪惡减輕，而不能再照着良心做去，因此编者旣很欽佩陳君心地的坦白誠實，和原諒他的苦衷，却又感覺到生活環境决定人們行動的力量的偉大。</p>
<p>陳君怕他的父親一旦爲婢女母親告發，難逃法網，其實這完全是心地純潔，入世未深的青年的幻想，是不必要的恐懼，無怪乎你父親要不受你的忠告了。何以故呢？陳君的父親旣是個「紳士」，靠着「紳士」的職業就可以養活一家十多口，則「紳士」的「威權」和「用塲」之大，亦可以很明顯的看出了，所以，他老人家「包婢爲妾」是在他的地位上能够做到的一會事，從反面來說，假如他不敢或不能「包婢爲妾」，或者，不能「實犯了姦淫少女之罪」，那他就根本没有資格做紳士。讀者和陳君看見編者這種論調，定嫌過激，一定馬上要問：「不錯：紳士是有力量的，但是爲什麽婢女母親還敢去吵呢？陳君父親爲什麽不用紳士力量去壓服她呢？」那編者可以這様回答他：編者所說的情形原是指實際上一般情形而言，例外當然是不免的，所以這是不能機械地去觀察的，不過，就是陳君這種情形吧，據編者的推測，婢女母親所以會如此跋扈，並非是陳君父親没有力量，或者是昏慒，顢頇，其最大原因倒是陳君父親迷戀於婢女，同時對於你的老母又有了惡感，因此婢女的母親纔有這様大膽，纔敢提出「不倫不類」的要求。陳君看吧，將來你的父親如果不再昏迷於婢女之母時，她的母親還敢不敢這様鬧—陳君不說過麽，他的父親有些聰明，才幹，且又做過敎學，當個政客，那他難道還會糊塗得如此，連這一點點法律常識都不懂。所以他之敢放心大膽胡鬧者，實有恃而無恐也。現在婢女不是屈服在「他的淫威」之下嗎，如果她的母親眞的敢與你父親作對，那他會什麽現在不去告他，却來與你母親等鬧得一塌糊塗做甚。由此觀之，她的母親卽使極狼貪，兇狠，却也奈何不得你的父親。不過人急跳梁，將來她也許會告你父親，但這你也不必過慮，如果你父親紳士銜頭依舊，大了不得多化幾個錢完事，「罪」和「坐牢」是斷斷不會的；你儘管放心好了。</p>
<p>因此，你所應研究的祗是「你的母親及你兄弟妻子等，對她應取如何態度」，此外都不成其爲問題。你要使她以後不再來鬧，這是不成功的，而且，也是犯着「祇看見了自已，没有顧到人家」的毛病。你父親糟塌了人家的女兒，使她在淫威之下屈服了，被强姦了，這種慘無人道的行爲恐怕連强盜也不肯爲，但事實上却出之於高貴雍容的縉紳先生之手。而且，一般人司空見慣，對於此種事件已毫不足奇，反而對於他的母親的吵鬧，倒十分詫異，責備痛恨，無所不至，社會情形如此，誠堪浩歎！陳君的心地是很坦白的，但是因爲切身利害關係過重，對於她的母親，竟未說一句公道話，反而有些厭恨之意，這種存心固不足爲陳君罪，但我們却不願陳君仍抱這種態度，人家女兒讓你父親强姦，却不應該做聲，你們受了她的侮辱，就該鳴不平，天下寗有是理—所以編者對於婢女母親的反抗，視爲極其應該，不論她是採取什麽手段。但是她對你們作對，編者却認爲是野蠻行爲，不明事理，因爲害她的是你的父親，在理應當向他交涉，來和你們吵鬧，不但是欺軟怕硬，而且是罪及無辜。所以，編者認爲陳君不應純從個人的立塲講話，不應躱避她母親的吵鬧，反而要帮助她拚命去向父親大鬧，纔是正理。陳君及令堂等能够採取這種態度，則於人於已兩皆有益，而且，糾紛可由此解决，否則，除非用方法壓服她母親不敢作聲，屈服在你們淫威之下外，是没有方法來避免她來鬧的。</p>
<p>陳君來信的中心意思是生活問題，因此，編者對於陳君着急萬分的事偏偏不着急；但另一方面，陳君不大着急的事却偏偏着急萬分，陳君家中一商店本來有三家，爲因年來農村破産，商業凋零，在城中較大的一個，已於去年年關中倒閉了！」這該是多麽可怕的事啊！如果以後經濟危機一天深入一天，陳君的商店一個都保持不住，則不要婢母來告發你父親的罪惡，（其實就是告發，而又照現行律公平處罰，也不會使你家破産的。）破産也還是不可避免的事。實際上，依編者淺薄的經濟學識觀察，我國經濟危機定然是一天天深入的，帝國主義侵略旣是一天天加緊，而陳君父親等又要靠着紳士職業生活，這還能使農村不日加破産，商業不日加凋零嗎！陳君家中，年來收入恐就較前减少，但是你父親却還要「包婢爲妾」還要多用錢，所以一方面來源旣少，他方面流出更多，如此，其餘二家商店，就是不倒閉，假如營業不好，那你家中經濟也定要十分拮据。要是這時你家的田地收穫，又不能像往年好，那麽在目前洋米傾銷穀賤傷農的情形下，你們一家的經濟更要加速地破産。在農村經濟。趨崩潰的過程中，有田地的人生活都要成問題，那些一無所有的佃農和雇農更要淪於飢寒。他們在無路可走的時候，定會不顧一切的挺而走險，那時你父親的「紳士職業生活」能不動搖麽。你一家十多口的生活，豈非依然没有保障。然而，這是無法挽救的。</p>
<p>陳君聰了編者上述一段話後，却也不要十分恐懼，感覺到自身没落的危險，須知恐懼是不中用的，恐懼是不能避免危險的降臨的，惟有認清危險之性質，及研究個人怎様就可不爲危險所危害，纔是避免危險之唯一方法。編者</p>

<h3>露露的勝利（十）（一）</h3>
<p>— 義大利M賽接歐著景心譯</p>
<p>「我願意等一等，」露露回答，「我需要更多地認識羅勃特。」</p>
<p>事實上，這個女兒是在觀察着，她像平素一様東走西跑，像平素一様地唱，笑，玩皮，但是她時常中斷了這些愉快的行爲而琢磨着她的姊姊，我是仔細地聽着羅勃特的每一句話。她的姊姊時常壓着嘴唇，緊着眉毛，露出一種非常注意的神氣。</p>
<p>因此露露看着她；而且關於她起了奇怪的事。羅勃特也不像往日那麽平靜和歡喜，而且好沉思，面孔蒼白，興奮着。他說話心不在焉，也很簡單；從前他很有趣的事情，現在也像是冷淡起來了；有時費很大的力量他才能抑制住他自已，又變得像往日一様了，但也只是很短的時候。他從不慣於作假，作也作得不好；他的情慾和内心的痛苦顯示在他的眼裏。</p>
<p>在這之間蘇菲亞也露出一種不同的様子；神經質的總在不安的蘇菲亞，現在有時會狂熱地抱着她的妹妹，有時好幾點鐘不要看她，躱着她。暗然而起的紅潮，火熱的紅潮，顯在她的雙頰上；一種火焰燃燒在她的眼裏；她的聲音，現在是沈重而滿充着情感，乾啞而軋聲；她的手戰顫着。在夜間她不睡覺。露露時常夜間起來，光着脚走到她的門口靜聽，於見聽見蘇菲亞在床上翻騰着，哭泣着。如果問她的話，蘇菲亞便聲明没有這麽一回事；她總是一様地回答。　　當蘇菲亞和羅勃特相遇的時候——這事是第天都有的——那在他們兩個人身上所起的變化是更顯眼了。很少說話，答話太突然太糢糊，時常有奇怪的眼光；時常整夜地他們不談話，可是每一個人又在細心地研究着對方的一舉一動。他們從没有彼此靠坐在一起；但是羅勃特總尋一個藉口拿起蘇菲亞觸過的女紅和是書籍。有時當她若是不在屋裏的時候，羅勃特總是越來越不安，凝視着那緊閉着的門，對人的問話心不在焉地回答着。有時蘇菲亞剛來了五分鐘，他就拿起他的帽子告辭了。這個女兒變得臉色蒼白，眼底下露出兩個黑眼圈。最後她决定不讓人家看見她了。約有一個星期每天晚間她把自已關在屋裏，不能忍耐地顫抖着，設法壓抑着她的不快。</p>

<p>Yu Shiming in Contact Regarding Surrender</p>
<p>Zhao Chengshou Leads Troops in a Forced Crossing, Already Occupied Yangjiahe</p>
<p>Main Force Battle Begins Near Bulunnuo</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua Telegram, Fu Zhan Kui and Liming Telegram from Sui report: Sun Dianying will leave the army soon and come to Sui with Fu to transfer to Shanxi. Ma Hongkui Telegram from Sui reports: Yu Shiming's surrender negotiations are mature, and Ningxia's siege will be lifted soon. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that Fu Zuoyi previously ordered Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengshou's troops to advance westward from Yangjiahe as opportunities arise, and use cavalry to scout towards Dengkou. Yesterday and today, the vanguard of the Jin-Sui army cavalry has had contact with Sun's army Xie brigade sentries. After Wang Jingguo arrived at Linhe, he is gathering the main force to actively advance westward. Infantry contact is expected within two or three days. Sun's army troops stationed in Dengkou are the Peng Zhenduo and Dou Lianxi brigades, with a total of about 5,000 men. They lack ammunition and supplies and cannot hold out. It is reported that Zhao Jinbiao has been sent to Linhe to manage the supply station and use automobiles to transport ammunition and supplies to the front. A general offensive will begin after a considerable period. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe Telegram: Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengshou ordered a full-line attack on the west bank of Yangjiahe on the evening of the 14th. Zhao led an armored vehicle team with a battalion of infantry to the front to supervise the forced crossing. They occupied Yangjiahe at noon. Sun's army Dou and Peng brigades retreated to Bulunnuo. Wang and Zhao are supervising the pursuit and ordered various units in Linhe to advance successively. They can occupy Bulunnuo on the evening of the 14th. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhan Kui telegraphed Ping, stating that Sun Dianying expressed his intention to leave the army, saying that if the authorities could repay the money owed to the people and provide living expenses, he would leave the army. The authorities agreed to gradually allocate funds for the money owed to the people and agreed to provide living expenses, but Sun was not satisfied, so there has been no result. Fu is continuing negotiations. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Baotou Telegram: There are no definite results for Fu Zhan Kui's trip west. Sun pretends to be easing the situation but attempts to attack Ningxia again. According to various relevant parties, it is feared that Sun feels the pressure of the Jin-Sui army tightening and this is only a temporary delaying tactic with no sincere intention to repent. The Jin-Sui army has been ordered to attack San Shen Palace and Dengkou on the 11th. Contact began near Bulunnuo, and there was a main force battle on the 14th. Important developments are expected in the evening. The vanguard of the Jin-Sui army has crossed Huangyangmutou. From that place to Bulunnuo, and from Bulunnuo to San Shen Palace, are each 60 li away. From San Shen Palace to Dengkou is 90 li. It is completely desert, making progress difficult. Automobiles cannot travel. All the security keys for Sun's army's rear are tied to this area, so Sun's army has constructed solid main positions based on the terrain, and constructed cover positions near San Shen Palace Bulunnuo to protect the rear. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying has been leading his troops to fiercely attack the provincial capital of Ningxia in recent days. A fierce battle is underway. Fu Zhan Kui has gone from Pingluo to Li Gangbao to meet with Sun. This morning, Ping received a telegram from Men Bingyue stating that the vanguard of the Jin-Sui army has reached Dengkou. A decision on a general offensive will be made after Fu and Sun meet and discuss the situation. The regular meeting of the Military Affairs Commission was suspended today due to the lack of important agenda items. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of dealing with Sun's army, the authorities have completed military preparations, but since peace is not completely hopeless, in order to quell the situation, they have not implemented a military solution. After the Jin-Sui army was dispatched, the authorities repeatedly telegraphed to urge the front lines. Men Bingyue has been reporting to Ping for days, stating that the vanguard of the Jin-Sui army has approached Dengkou and is continuing to advance. According to relevant information, the Jin-Sui army aims to resolve the Sun-Ma issue peacefully, unless military resolution is absolutely necessary. Hu Zongnan's troops have entered Ningyuan, awaiting orders to attack. Whether Sun will leave the army immediately, Fu has not telegraphed Ping to report. The authorities have not received any reports on the war situation in Ningxia. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Baotou: Sun Dianying previously printed 1.4 million military notes in Baotou, which are circulating in the Dengkou and Pingluo areas. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Baotou, 14th Dispatch: The Jin-Sui army engaged Sun's army's 119th Division in battle at dawn on the 14th. Except for Peng Zhenduo's brigade, which expressed its intention to surrender and has been ordered to station at Datian to await reorganization, the rest have scattered towards Tianxingquan. San Shen Palace can be captured by the 15th. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Inspecting Japanese Troops in Gubeikou</h3>
<p>The Issue of the Withdrawal of Puppet Police</p>
<p>Yongjian Asks for Instructions</p>
<p>(Beiping) Nakamura, the commander of the Japanese 6th Division, along with Japanese military officer Shibayama and others, went to Gubeikou yesterday and inspected the stationed Japanese troops there this morning. They returned to Beiping this afternoon and will visit the Great Wall at Qinglongqiao tomorrow morning, returning to Beiping that day. The day after tomorrow, they will go to Tianjin and return to their posts in their home country. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Gubeikou takeover plan stipulates that Gubeikou and the surrounding areas will be completely handed over to our side for takeover. The puppet police in Nantiange and Beishanyin have not withdrawn and are still inspecting merchants as usual. The Jiji District Office previously telegraphed Lieutenant Colonel Matsui, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Chengde, to negotiate, but there has been no concrete effect. Huo Shi also negotiated with the Japanese garrison commander Yongjian, and Yongjian flew to Chengde on the 10th to consult Matsui for instructions. The withdrawal of the puppet police may be realized in the short term. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are many small passes along the Great Wall in the war zone, and puppet police are stationed at each of them. Our side is actively preparing to negotiate the takeover of important passes such as Xifeng, Jieling, Jiumen, and Lengkou. It is planned that the public security bureaus of the respective counties will send police to guard each small pass, and local militias will be dispatched to assist in guarding. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The newly appointed commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin, Major General Umezu, is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin by ship at 2:00 PM on the 19th and take office before noon on the 20th. Kōtarō Nakamura will return to his country on the evening of the 21st. Straight.</p>
<h3>Tang Youren Arrives in Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Youren arrived in Beiping tonight to inspect the diplomatic situation in North China. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Youren arrived in Beiping at 8:48 PM on the 14th. Wang Zensi and others were at the station to welcome him. After Tang got off the train, he quickly rushed out of the station and went straight to the Beijing Hotel to rest. It is said that he came north for private matters and will stay for three to five days before returning to Beijing. Tang was humorous and refused to comment on various diplomatic issues. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tang Youren and several secretaries from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs took the Pinghu train from Beijing to Beiping the day before yesterday and arrived at the Tianjin Main Station at 4:25 PM on the 14th. Tang told reporters that he had been to Beiping once since May of last year and is coming here now because he has not been north for a long time to see the situation in various aspects and does not have any mission. All diplomatic affairs in North China are now handled by Chairman Huang of the Beiping Political Readjustment Council, with the approval of the central government, and he has been very successful. Rumors that Huang reported the diplomatic progress to the central government are feared to keep him from leaving Beiping due to official duties. The administrative powers of all the Great Wall passes have been recovered, and the unwithdrawn troops are still being negotiated. He will meet with various parties in Beiping and stay for about a week before returning to Beijing. According to Tang, China and Japan have not started negotiations on a treaty, and all kinds of rumors are baseless. China and Russia have not started consultations on a trade agreement either, and the government has not received any confirmation. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Southwest Military Affairs Committee Issue</p>
<h3>Various Parties Are Exchanging Opinions</h3>
<p>Generally Expected to Become a Reality</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Political News: Although the relevant parties have not explicitly acknowledged the issue of establishing a military affairs committee in the southwest, various parties are secretly contacting and exchanging opinions. It is reported that they are gradually becoming mature. After Chen of Guangdong proposed this proposal, Guangxi province has expressed its approval. However, Chen of Guangdong's opinion is that the scope of the committee should include all the southwestern provinces, while Li Bai of Guangxi advocates a phased approach, with the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi as the scope of the first phase, and then adding the provinces of Hunan, Yunnan, and Guizhou when the actual need arises. He also advocates limiting the number of committee members to seven to eleven. At present, various parties continue to exchange opinions on this matter, and there are generally not many major problems. It is believed that the Southwest Military Affairs Committee can be realized within a month or two. In the future, all military officers above the rank of division commander will be included as committee members. The three commanders-in-chief of the northern, southern, and western bandit suppression routes, Chen Jitang, Jiang Dingwen, and He Jian, will be the ex officio standing committee members. All parties are advocating for Chen Jitang to be the chairman. Chen also recommended Zhang Fakui, who is studying abroad, to be a standing committee member and has telegraphed to urge him to return to the country. Chen plans to send Yu Hanmou or Miao Pei to visit Wang and Jiang in Beijing and Jiangxi to discuss this matter in detail. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Speculation on the Spanish Situation Heng.</h3>
<p>In recent days, news of the unrest in Spain has been repeatedly seen in newspapers. The Chinese people often overlook this newly created republic because its position is not related to the overall situation in Europe. Also, because of this usual neglect, its political situation has become an incomprehensible mystery in the minds of the general public. Some suspect that there is a possibility of restoration, while others worry that there will be a communist revolution. There are not a few who are simply unaware of the truth. However, from our perspective, although the current political situation in Spain is not peaceful, restoration has become an extremely difficult fact, and communism is also an unfounded fear. In the future, the political situation in Spain will be controlled by the center-right parties.</p>
<p>It has been three years since the Spanish Revolution. At the beginning of the revolution, apart from the extreme left and extreme right, the wishes of all parties were to remove the royal family. From the right-wing Republican Party to the left-wing Socialist Party, the goals were the same. However, in addition to this common goal, each also had its own special demands and thought of using democratic political means to achieve the fulfillment of each party's desires. However, after the opening of Congress, the Socialist Party occupied the majority, and Azana of the right-wing Republican Party joined forces with it to establish a left-leaning cabinet. This cabinet controlled the political situation in Spain for nearly two and a half years. Its achievements can be described as follows: (1) Confiscation of church property and the property of those involved in restoration and distribution to tenant farmers and owner-farmers. (2) Enactment of labor laws stipulating an eight-hour workday and the implementation of labor insurance and unemployment benefits. (3) Restriction of military participation in politics, preventing the army from becoming a tool of any party.</p>
<p>For a new country that has been in revolution for less than three years to have such achievements is quite satisfactory. However, the reason for the fall of the Azana cabinet lies in the two issues of land and labor. From the perspective of the right-wing parties, what Azana did was already an excessive action. From the perspective of the extreme left-wing anarchist and communist parties, it was too compromising. For example, less than a quarter of the total amount of church property was confiscated and distributed to farmers. The confiscation of the property of the restoration faction was also delayed until the end of last summer. As for the land of most nobles, the uncompensated confiscation was never carried out. This was deeply resented by the anarchist and communist parties. Therefore, during Azana's tenure, there were riots by these violent elements. As for the bourgeoisie, given the immaturity of Spanish industry and the intensity of foreign competition, they could not tolerate excessive preferential treatment for workers, so they also deeply resented what Azana and the Socialist Party did. Therefore, they joined forces to overthrow Azana. The political situation was precarious and almost impossible to sustain. On September 7, 1933, President Zamora forced Azana to resign. Soon after, he dissolved Congress and held a re-election on November 19. As a result, the right-center parties won a great victory. The current Lerroux cabinet is supported by the center-right wing.</p>
<p>Therefore, the parliamentary re-election last winter was a symbol of Spain's return to the right. After that, the left-wing parties became a minority party in Congress and found it difficult to control the political situation. This prompted the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Anarchist Party to form a grand alliance and resort to illegal riots, which was an extremely natural trend. However, these three parties are similar in appearance but extremely incompatible in reality. Temporary cooperation may be possible, but true cooperation is out of the question. Therefore, it is predictable that they will be unable to change the political situation. As for the restoration movement, it is also difficult. The attitude of the Catholic Party towards the Republican Party has also changed recently. If the Republican Party does not endanger the existence of the church, they will not advocate restoration. In addition, the current army has been nationalized, and the royal family can no longer use it. Therefore, considering the circumstances, both restoration and communism are impossible. The political situation in Spain in the future will be in the hands of the center-right factions and will not be easily shaken. Although the prime minister may change, the overall situation will not be affected.</p>

<h3>Mongolian Representatives Return to Peiping</h3>

<p>Legislator Zhang Weihan Speaks On</p>
<h3>The British Troops' Invasion of Yunnan Incident</h3>
<p>It is Heard that the Locals Have Already Risen to Resist</p>
<p>Please Request the Government to Quickly Demarcate the Border and Colonize the Border Region</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to legislator Zhang Weihan, who is familiar with the Yunnan-Burma border affairs, speaking to reporters, British forces, relying on military force, entered our Banhong area to mine, and the local people have risen to resist. A conflict has already occurred on February 1st, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. The people of Yunnan Province hope that the central government will quickly negotiate to protect this patriotic territory. As far as I know, the reason for this case is indeed the British's deliberate aggression, but the undefined border is the root cause. Because the Yunnan border extends for thousands of miles, divided into north and south sections, with Jian'gao Mountain as its hub. The northern section, north of Jian'gao Mountain, has been surveyed but the border has not been determined. The southern section, south of Jian'gao Mountain, has had its two ends surveyed and boundary stones erected. However, the middle section, from the Wunampa River in Lancang County flowing into the opposite bank of the Nanding River to the Nampa River near the Mengha River in Lancang County flowing into the Naka River, although it was once surveyed, it became an unresolved issue due to disputes between the two sides. The Banhong and other places that the British are eager to develop belong to this section, which is the so-called undefined southern section. During the Sino-British joint survey at the end of the Qing Dynasty, Xue Fucheng's line drawing corrected by others in London was used as a blueprint, resulting in our invisible loss of territory, which is unknown for thousands of miles, which was fundamentally wrong. However, Banhong and other places are still within our territory. It's just that the British covet the mineral resources there and, using the excuse that the longitude and latitude of the Xue map do not match, they forcibly use Gongmingshan, hundreds of miles away, to refer to Kongmingshan, which belongs to the inland area of ​​Lancang County, drawing a line themselves, deep into the inland, demanding a border demarcation, that is, they want to incorporate Banhong, Xinhe, Mengha, Gonglong, Gongyong, Xiaomenglong, and Mengbo Xiyi and other places belonging to the Menglian Tusi into their possession, which our side is naturally difficult to concede again.</p>
<p>During the 30th year of the Guangxu reign, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a note in response, still negotiating for them to send personnel for joint surveying. The British side ignored it, and it has been unresolved for a long time. When I was in Yunnan in the past, I silently observed the various actions of the British and knew that the undefined border would inevitably breed hidden dangers. Therefore, when I entered Nanking in the 17th year to participate in the amendment of the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty, I presented an opinion paper detailing the past failures of the Yunnan-Burma border affairs and the reasons that should be adhered to in the future, totaling several thousand words, requesting the diplomatic authorities to quickly negotiate with the British ambassador and send personnel to survey and demarcate to achieve a fundamental solution. However, due to the changing times, it was delayed for another five years, and now, unfortunately, my words have come true, and a major dispute has occurred. Looking back on the past, how can I not sigh with emotion? I believe that for this issue today, on the one hand, we must quickly demarcate the border and determine the territory, and on the other hand, we must actively colonize the border to prevent covetousness. If we only demarcate the border without colonizing it, the result will still be the same as not demarcating it. If we only colonize the border without demarcating it, it will inevitably lead to more disputes. The two should be used in conjunction and efforts should be made in both. Recently, I received confirmation that the Yunnan authorities are actively proceeding with border colonization, with the consensus of officials and people and a determination. I only hope that the diplomatic authorities will do their best to negotiate and quickly negotiate with the British side, and each send senior officials to lead specialized surveying personnel to the border within a limited time to re-survey and demarcate the Yunnan-Burma border line and establish boundary markers. Both sides should set up defense posts in the border areas, each guarding its territory, so that disputes can be permanently resolved and friendship can be maintained. If we continue to delay and sit back and make mistakes, I fear that as time goes by, the border people will be subdued by others, their southern crowns will not be changed, and they will have forgotten that they are Han Chinese, and it will be impossible to regain the sincere inward orientation of Banhong and other places today.

<p>The World's Eyes Focus on Rome</p>
<h3>The Italian-Austrian-Hungarian Tripartite Conference Begins</h3>
<p>The Surface Focus is on Economic and Commercial Affairs</p>
<p>In Reality, It is to Unite Against Germany</p>
<p>The Conference Will Seek to Expand and Enlist the Small Entente Countries to Join</p>
<p>It is Rumored That Germany Plans to Build a New Canal to Undermine Italian Policy</p>
<p>Rome Since today, Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös have been formally invited by the Italian government and treated as state guests. Dollfuss will hold his first meeting with Prime Minister Mussolini at noon today. Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös and former Austrian Deputy Chancellor Winkler will begin working together at 10:00 this morning. After meeting with Dollfuss, Gömbös will meet with the German Ambassador to Italy. At noon, Prince Sheqi will host a banquet, which will be attended by all important figures from Austria and Hungary in Rome. (14th Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Austrian Prime Minister Declares Independence</h3>
<p>Rome Before the start of the tripartite conference here today, Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss told guests that Italy, Austria, and Hungary are now trying to prevent the Danube countries from engaging in mutually destructive struggles, which would exhaust their strength. Austria's duty is to reconcile the Danube countries and unite them. To achieve this goal, Austria must maintain its autonomy and independence, which has been proven by recent events. This morning, the Austrian Prime Minister held lengthy discussions with the Italian Prime Minister, and then engaged in discussions with the Hungarian Prime Minister. It is heard that Austria wants to obtain satisfactory conditions for using Trieste as a maritime outlet, and wants to increase the sales of Austrian timber in Italy. (14th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome The Italian-Hungarian-Austrian conference, which is related to the security of the political situation and world peace, opened here today. The cabinet ministers of the three countries arrived one after another to conduct discussions on the critical situation between Germany and Austria. 100,000 Italian troops are stationed on the Austrian border today, ready to repel any enemy that invades the two countries at any time. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania are also prepared to fight in the event of an incident. The meeting of Prime Minister Mussolini of Italy, Prime Minister Dollfuss of Austria, and Prime Minister Gömbös of Hungary in Rome today will determine the actions taken by the three countries in the face of the German National Socialist Party's endangering Austria, in order to realize the agreement between the three countries. A communiqué issued by the secretariat of the conference stated that the purpose of this conference is to discuss the economic relations between the three countries, but it is believed that the main topic of the meeting is the policy related to the situation in Germany and Austria. Prime Minister Mussolini spoke first, requesting the abandonment of rhetoric on political action, and turning to discussing strengthening Austria's position to resist the National Socialist Party's conspiracy to occupy it, in order to avoid war. Prime Minister Mussolini expressed his disgust with military disarmament trends and European political negotiations, and declared that he personally would try to save the crisis in Central Europe. Before departing for Rome, Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss made an important adjustment to the cabinet, in order to strengthen the power of the royalists to suppress the National Socialist Party, and to slightly suppress the unrest elements in Austria. Prince Hatton has now been appointed as Minister of Defense. Given the current situation in Austria, the Minister of Defense is the most important position in the Austrian government. This position was previously held concurrently by Prime Minister Dollfuss. (13th Day National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Related to the Future of Central Europe</h3>
<p>Rome The Prime Ministers of Austria and Hungary have come here together to discuss important matters related to the future of Central Europe with the Italian authorities. Therefore, the eyes of the world are now focused on Rome, and no European leader is not closely watching the development of the situation here.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Closely Watch</h3>
<p>At the same time, Reuters learned that the British government fully expressed its sympathy, only needing to avoid dangerous political disputes. The French government feels that the revitalization of the Danube basin is beneficial to the matter. This attitude may make the Little Entente countries view the Rome talks with a friendly eye.</p>
<h3>The Austrian Prime Minister is Overwhelmed by Favor</h3>
<p>When Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss arrived in Rome last night, the welcome ceremony was extremely grand. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and many dignitaries personally went to greet him, and when the Austrian Prime Minister drove to the official residence, it was almost a triumphal procession. The crowds in the streets were as thick as walls, and the cheers continued. The Austrian Prime Minister seemed not to have expected such honor, and raised his hand to give a Fascist salute in response.</p>
<h3>The Three Countries Submit Memorandums to Each Other</h3>
<p>Negotiations begin today with the aim of establishing an economic alliance. If successful, the European future will have far-reaching political implications, and not just economic ones. The Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian sides have submitted memoranda as the basis for talks. The Italian memorandum is based on the recommendations of the Stresa Conference (which opened in 1932, with fifteen countries discussing the financial and economic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe), advocating the conclusion of bilateral economic and regional agreements.</p>
<h3>Difficult Commercial Issues</h3>
<p>The Hungarian Prime Minister arrived here on Sunday and has already discussed commercial issues with the Italian Prime Minister, especially focusing on Italian-Hungarian freight rates. This is a thorny issue, as Hungary's exports are mostly rice and livestock, while Italy does not need rice and can purchase cheaper livestock from Yugoslavia, as Yugoslavia is closer to Italy. Similar difficulties will also be encountered between Italy and Austria, as Italy is best suited to trade with Yugoslavia due to natural conditions, while Austria is best suited to trade with Czechoslovakia. Therefore, Italy is eager to expand the scope of its meetings and enlist the three Small Entente countries, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, to join the conference.</p>
<h3>Czechoslovakia Softens Towards Italy</h3>
<p>Czechoslovakia has recently softened its attitude towards Italy, but is still unwilling to shake hands with Italy immediately. However, it is rumored that Czech Foreign Minister Beneš is now willing to meet with the Italian Prime Minister to explain everything.</p>
<h3>Determination to Aid Austrian Independence</h3>
<p>It is generally believed that the meeting of the Prime Ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary will not involve the difficult issue of the restoration of the Austrian imperial system. The Small Entente countries have made it clear that they will regard Austria's restoration as an act that would lead to an immediate declaration of war. It is generally recognized that the main purpose of the Italian Prime Minister is to maintain Austria's independence, as the European balance of power would be disrupted if Austria were under German control. Austria lost a lot of land due to the Treaty of Trianon and now wants to gain Italy's assistance to extend its demand for amending this treaty and other unfavorable treaties.</p>
<h3>Germany Plots Destruction</h3>
<p>It is rumored that German Chancellor Hitler has now devised a clever plan to undermine Austria's increasingly friendly relationship with Italy, planning to build a canal connecting the Danube and Elbe Rivers to avoid the Italian Prime Minister enticing Austria and Hungary with the outlet to the Adriatic Sea through Trieste and Fiume. If the plan to build this canal is implemented, the Danube River's commerce will shift to Germany, and Germany's superior position in Central Europe will be further established.

<p>Vienna With Prince Hatton being appointed Minister of Defense today, the Austrian restoration movement can be said to have taken another step forward. Prince Hatton was a front-line commander in the European War who led his troops into battle and has been in the military for a long time. He is an important figure in the Austrian army. In the recent incident, he once again showed his prowess and is known for his military organization. With Prince Hatton taking on the new position, Deputy Prime Minister Fei, who previously served as Minister of Defense, can now concentrate on his new position as Commander of the Vienna Security Force.

<h3>Military Disarmament is Reaching a Dead End</h3>
<p>The French Reply to the British Note Will be Sent Out Today</p>
<p>Will Clearly Reject the British Proposal</p>
<p>Britain Attempts to Convene an Air Force Conference</p>
<p>To Open Up New Paths for Military Disarmament</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news today, France's note to Britain on Thursday will clearly declare the failure of military disarmament negotiations and open up new paths to seek practical discussions on military disarmament. The recent British memorandum on military disarmament to various European countries, as well as the United States and Japan, is Britain's last effort for the "months-long stalemate of the military disarmament crisis." After being studied by the French National Defense Council, the French reply has been formally drafted. The note reiterates the reasons why France cannot accept the British plan and details why France cannot disarm, as Germany demands the restoration of arms. France and Germany are neighboring countries, and Germany is warlike, so how can France disarm and rest easy? According to French political sources, the British government had expected France to reject its proposal and knows that the British government is now planning to invite the world's major powers to participate in an air force conference to seek a new way out for military disarmament. The location of the conference is rumored to be London. Britain believes that the status of its own air force is still very dangerous, so it believes that the British air force must be equal to the air force military strength of any other country (that is capable of attacking Britain).

<h3>Germany's Second Reply to France</h3>

<p>(Berlin) On January 19th of this year, the German government sent a memorandum to the French government on the issue of military disarmament. On February 14th, the French government replied with a memorandum, raising special reservations about Germany's proposals. As for the various questions raised by Germany regarding the number of troops in French colonies, no answer was given. After receiving the French reply, the German government drafted a note in response to France, which was delivered to the French Foreign Ministry by French Ambassador to Germany Poncet today. According to the German government's wishes, it is intended not to release it. It is heard that the wording of the reply is mild, but there are no new points. (14th Day Havas Dispatch)</p>

The three appointees will also attend Army Department meetings and assist the Army Department in studying the equipment of the Army Air Force and the training of personnel of the Army Air Force. However, all parties find Lindbergh's new appointment strange, as Lindbergh had a fierce dispute with the Chief Executive over the cancellation of this airmail contract.

First, Mr. Hatake Momosaku of the Seiyukai party raised questions regarding Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations after the ceasefire in North China. Foreign Minister Hirota replied as follows:</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese relations have recently begun to move towards improvement. Mr. Hatake then asked:</p>
<p>What are your views on economic relations with Manchuria and Russia?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied:</p>
<p>Regarding relations with Manchuria, we are working day and night to promote trade relations between Japan and Manchuria for the sake of mutual coexistence and co-prosperity. I feel that the time for a special agreement will come in the near future.</p>
<p>As for trade relations with Russia, the basic treaty in Beijing clearly stipulates that Japan should be able to utilize the natural resources within Russian territory. To implement this agreement, we have repeatedly reminded and urged the Soviet Russian government to pay attention to it. (Jiji News Agency telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives Committee on the Trade Protection Act convened at 1:20 PM. Foreign Minister Hirota, in response to questions from Hatake Momosaku (Seiyukai), stated that the Trade Protection Act is a unified consensus among Japanese businesses, and there is hope to implement the initial policy. The government is also seeking countermeasures with businesses. In negotiations with India, Japan has made major concessions because, considering the future of trade, it is necessary to conclude an appropriate agreement as much as possible. The China issue is gradually changing, and negotiations have made considerable progress. Negotiations on the North China Railway are also underway. The government is striving for a satisfactory resolution between Russia and Manchuria. The policy of economic co-prosperity between Japan and Manchuria is expected to achieve its goal by concluding treaties such as customs duties. In addition, the ruble conversion rate related to the auction of fishing grounds in Soviet Russia is an important issue, so we are working hard to resolve it quickly. Furthermore, regarding relations with the United States, there is a need to dispatch peace envoys to the United States. He explained the important issues at hand and adjourned the meeting at 2:30 PM.

<p>The Little Entente Countries</p>
<h3>Acknowledging the Soviet Union Issue</h3>
<p>The Two Sides Had Mutually Signed Conventions</p>
<p>Recognition Has Long Been a Fact</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital. News from the Czech capital says that the three countries of the Little Entente (Romania, Czech Republic, and Yugoslavia) will formally recognize the Soviet Union sooner or later. It is said that the Yugoslav Minister to Germany, Mr. Baluchig, was appointed as the Yugoslav Minister to Russia. Mr. Baluchig recently returned here from Berlin, so it is said that this matter is related to the recognition news from the Czech side. Official sources have formally denied the above statement, saying that during the World Economic Conference in July last year, the countries of the Little Entente signed a convention with the Soviet Union and other countries stipulating the definition of aggressor countries, so each country's recognition of the Soviet Union has already become a fact. There is no need to officially announce the recognition through formalities, otherwise it would be inconsistent with diplomatic practice. What each country of the Little Entente should do now is to appoint a minister to Russia and submit credentials to complete the recognition formalities. (Havas telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>(Harbin) It is widely rumored here that the Chinese Eastern Railway has been successfully bought by "Manchukuo" for a price of 135,000,000 Japanese yen. However, neither Russia nor the puppet government has confirmed this statement. However, many believe that the secret meeting on the Chinese Eastern Railway in Tokyo is proceeding very satisfactorily. The gradual easing of relations between local Manchurian and Russian officials can serve as proof. Official circles believe that even if the Chinese Eastern Railway has not yet been sold, a peaceful solution will inevitably be reached soon. (Reuters telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>British-Japanese Textile Industry Negotiations</p>
<h3>Formally Declared Ruptured Yesterday</h3>
<p>Japan Rejects New British Proposal</p>
<p>Future Negotiations to Be Handled by the Government</p>
<p>Britain Disagrees on Abolishing the Trade Treaty</p>
<p>(London) The British-Japanese textile industry conference has now broken down. Today, representatives from both sides held a joint meeting, then withdrew from the meeting place for a private meeting, and finally announced the breakdown of negotiations. The Japanese delegation was instructed by the Osaka Cotton Spinning Association to terminate negotiations if the British side did not change its attitude towards the scope of the region. The failure of today's talks was due to this instruction. The British chief representative decided today to ask the government to handle the matter. The British chief representative, Mr. Barlow, stated today that he does not know what the Japanese side will do. The basis put forward by the Japanese side is unacceptable to the British side, and the British side's demands are unacceptable to the Japanese side. The Japanese side now claims that the current position is hopeless. The memorandum submitted by the British side to the Japanese delegation has been published, containing specific suggestions as follows: (1) The British representatives agree to discuss starting from one or more regions, and the Japanese representatives can choose this region. The requested designated regions are Africa, Asia, the Near East, the Middle East, Europe, South America, and Central America. (2) The markets included in the Near East and the Middle East are not included in Asia or Europe. (3) The markets within the British Empire and the Japanese Empire must be regarded as separate regions, and they will be discussed after considerable progress has been made in the discussion of other regions. (4) The discussion of each region does not hinder the freedom of the representatives of both sides to form their entire final resolution. Today, members of the House of Commons asked the government what actions it would take regarding the breakdown of the negotiations. Under-Secretary of State for Overseas Self-Government Malcolm MacDonald replied that this was not something he could answer. We are prepared to support the negotiations to achieve success. Members also asked what actions the Colonial Office would take regarding Japanese goods. Malcolm MacDonald replied that this question should be answered at a later date. (Reuters telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, Japanese textile industry leaders today telegraphed the Japanese delegation in London, stating that if the British proposals regarding regions and quantities can be implemented, it may be possible to continue negotiations. This move indicates that Japan wants to establish an agreement with Britain and its territories first, and then involve other regions. Japan refuses to acknowledge unilateral restrictions and reductions in any case. It is reported that the Japanese government has no intention of intervening at the moment. The British-Japanese cotton industry talks are scheduled to continue today. (Reuters telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese cotton industry representatives visited Mr. Matsudaira, the British Ambassador, on the afternoon of the 13th, and explained in detail the reasons why they had to reject the British proposal regarding the British-Japanese conference. They also said that if the British side does not change its attitude, the conference on the 14th will have no other solution than a breakdown, and they hope to be understood. Ambassador Matsudaira hoped that even if the negotiations were to break down out of necessity, they should still be concluded satisfactorily in order to reserve room for the resumption of future conferences. (Jiji News Agency telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The British and Japanese cotton textile industry conference suddenly declared a breakdown today. The opinions of the representatives from both sides are quite different, and it is feared that it will be difficult for both sides to reconcile without the intervention of diplomats. The British side is currently paying close attention to the British-Japanese trade treaty signed in 1868, and there is concern that this will lead to a commercial war between Britain and Japan. However, opinions within Britain are also quite divided. One group of people advocates maintaining the old trade treaty, while another group strongly advocates abolishing the trade treaty. In recent years, British cotton textile, rubber, and porcelain merchants have suffered greatly from competition from Japanese merchants, so they deeply hope that the trade treaty can be abolished as soon as possible. However, general postal companies, chemical plants, and steel machinery plants are reluctant to abolish this trade treaty because their sales in Japan are quite good, which would hurt the feelings of British and Japanese businessmen. According to the speculation of general banking personnel, they feel that Japan has long-term debts of about 150 million Japanese yen in the London market. Once the trade treaty is abolished, it will have a significant impact on such debts, so the banking industry also opposes the proposal to abolish the trade treaty.

<h3>Iraq Boycotts Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Marseille. A Syrian newspaper sent from Beirut (Syria) was received here today, reporting news from the capital of Iraq, saying that the Iraqi people have begun to express dissatisfaction with the import of Japanese manufactured goods. For example, the people of Shatra and Nahlwa Sli recently held demonstrations against merchants selling Japanese goods, surrounding the stores of these merchants, resulting in significant losses. After this movement, the Iraqi government seems to have decided to increase the import tax on Japanese goods, and an order will be issued soon to implement it. According to the same news, the import of British Lancashire goods into Iraq decreased by 62% compared to previous years, while the import of Japanese goods increased by 23%.

<p>Sasebo. As of 4:30 PM, the rescue work for Tomozuru had discovered the bodies of nine people, including First Class Engineer Eguchi Yutaro. To date, a total of fifty-seven bodies have been found. (Dentsu telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Sasebo. The drainage and rescue work for the torpedo boat Tomozuru is not only a desperate effort by all members through the night, but also officers and employees are making noises by hitting iron plates with iron hammers to add energy to the survivors inside the boat. Starting at 0:50 AM on the 14th, they began to chisel holes in the bottom of the boat. Fearing the intrusion of evil gas into the boat, they did not use acetylene gas, but continued to cut the iron plates with a furnace. At 1:50 AM, they rescued Petty Officer Third Class Yanagida Suteichi and one sailor and accommodated them in the naval hospital. At 2:00 AM, they made full contact with the inside of the boat. As a result of the rescue team's search inside the boat, they carried out thirteen bodies of victims and placed them in the Hubei War Memorial Hall. At 2:30 AM, they discovered Petty Officer Third Class Inoue Heiji and Tajima Sanmori, both unconscious and collapsed inside the boat. Petty Officer Tajima eventually died. At 5:30 AM, they found the bodies of three sailors and placed them in the memorial hall. At the same time, for the sake of rescue, two holes have been opened. At 6:00 AM, there was no response to external questions. Officers and soldiers below the commander showed more concern. The rescue team continued their silent work. As of now, in addition to the rescued and the 31 dead who have been carried out, there are still 83 people who may still be trapped inside the boat, but their fate is hopeless. More than 300 family members of the crew are hugging each other and crying every time the names of survivors are announced.</p>
<p>No officer below the rank of Sa has been found. These officers are probably all on the bridge directing, and were swept away by the waves when they capsized. Among those who have been identified as dead, the names of petty officers second class and above are as follows: Petty Officer Second Class Atsumoto Yoshio, Nagao Heihati, Petty Officer Third Class Koga Shigeru. (Dentsu telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Sasebo. Admiral Suetsugu, Commander of the Combined Fleet, said about the Tomozuru disaster: Although Tomozuru does not belong to the Combined Fleet, it is a newly built elite torpedo boat, not to be compared with the torpedo boats at the time of the Russo-Japanese War. It is strange that such a new type of warship should capsize. There was a big storm at sea that night. Waves washed over the deck of such a huge battleship "Kongo" like a waterfall. Tomozuru is a small boat of 527 tons, and it is expected that maneuvering will be difficult. Japan builds such defensive warships because of the restrictions of the naval treaty. Japan has to advocate abolishing proportionalism and establishing equality of armaments. (Jiji News Agency telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian commented on the loss of the Japanese torpedo boat Tomozuru, saying that it was caused by the excessive weight of the cannons installed on the boat. The newspaper said that the Tomozuru incident is not trivial. In the future, similar naval boats will inevitably be modified due to this incident. According to reports, the Tomozuru has a displacement of only 527 tons, but carries as many as three 5-inch caliber cannons. Compared with similar British torpedo destroyers, the Tomozuru carries too much cannon. The British torpedo destroyer Akaste has a displacement of 1,350 tons and carries only four 4.7-inch caliber cannons. (Havas News Agency telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>Trade Policy Towards Russia</p>
<h3>State-Owned Enterprises Not Easy to Implement</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, our country planned to establish state-owned enterprises for trade with Russia in order to control it and avoid unilateral dumping. However, the state-owned enterprise plan has two problems. First, the Chinese people's free trade has become a habit, and second, the advantages and disadvantages of the state-owned method are mutually evident. If we want to prevent unilateral dumping, the current situation of dumping is not unique to Russia. The situation in other countries is the same. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry believes that it is not easy to start a state-owned enterprise plan solely for Russia and has to change its policy. The responsible authorities are studying in detail the cooperative policy between the government and merchants in order to adapt to customs and ensure consistency in trade with various countries.

<p>Four-Route Army</p>
<h3>Will Soon Encircle and Suppress Jiangxi Bandits</h3>
<p>Bandit Areas Only Include Thirteen Counties in Jiangxi and Fujian</p>
<p>Fujian Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Count and Organize People's Militia</p>
<p>Xiamen correspondence: Since Chiang Ting-wen returned from Guangdong, the four-route army's encirclement and suppression of Jiangxi bandits is about to be realized. Sun Yuanliang, Leng Xin, Chen Mingren, Lu Xingbang, and other divisions in northern Fujian captured Jiangle County on the 7th. The bandit Fang Zhimin's forces retreated to Tai Ning. Currently, the communist bandits in northern Fujian have completely failed. In western Fujian, the 3rd Division of the 4th Column of the Central Army took over defense of Longyan on the 7th. Fan Ling's supplementary regiment of the division is now stationed in Longyan City. A small part of the 1st Independent Division of the Guangdong Army under Huang Renhuan, Yan Yingyu's brigade, which was originally stationed in the city, withdrew at noon on the 7th, heading to Yongding Kanshi via Nanyang Dam. Peng Guozhen, the magistrate of Longyan County appointed by the Guangdong Army, also went with the army. The 3rd Division is expected to arrive in Yan in full on the 10th. Division Commander Li Yutang is also scheduled to depart for Yan on the 10th. Li Chuying's 247th Brigade of the 83rd Division under Liu Kan arrived in Zhangzhou on the 8th. The 249th Brigade and the supplementary regiment arrived in Tong'an on the 8th and are expected to reach Zhangzhou on the 10th or 11th. The division is also preparing to advance on Longyan, with the 9th Division as a reserve force, remaining in Zhangzhou for replenishment and training. According to military intelligence, the area currently occupied by Jiangxi bandits is limited to the area from Guangchang and Luo Chang in the north to Huichang and Junmenling in the south, from Xingguo in the west to Ninghua in Fujian in the east, accounting for only seven counties in Jiangxi: Guangchang, Shicheng, Ningdu, Xingguo, Yudu, Ruijin, and Huichang. And six counties in Fujian: Tai Ning, Jian Ning, Ninghua, Guihua, Liancheng, and Changting, totaling thirteen counties. The main force is mostly in the Guangchang and Tai Ning area. Only local communists are in Liancheng, and only a small number of red bandits are in Changting. After the Fujian Rebellion was quelled, the National Army resumed strict blockades, and the shortage of edible salt in the bandit areas has become increasingly severe. It is predictable that they cannot withstand the four-route army's encirclement and suppression, leading to their extermination.</p>
<p>Besides suppressing bandits, the only problem in Fujian Province is the aftermath of the people's militia, especially the people's militia in southern Fujian, whose numbers account for more than 80% of the province's people's militia. Xiao Jing, director of the western and southern Fujian security branch, passed through Xiamen to Quanzhou on the 3rd of this month to first inspect the Quanzhou-Yongchun-Xingren people's militia and to determine the counting and organization procedures. On the 6th, he counted and organized Ma Hongxing's troops. On the 7th, he counted and organized Chen Peiyu's troops. On the 9th, he counted and organized Lin Jing's troops in Xianyou. On the 10th, he counted and organized Chen Yucai's troops in Anxi. On the 12th, he counted and organized Peng Tang's troops in Yongchun. After counting, Ma Hongxing's troops had more than 700 guns and more than ten machine guns. The guns were all qualified. After Chen Peiyu's troops were counted, more than 1,000 qualified guns were found. The results of Lin Jing's troops' count are not yet known. In addition, Liu Chaoran also applied to the southern district security branch on the 8th to be counted, and Zhang Xiongnan also applied for a count. Both are awaiting a scheduled count. The war between Hong Wende and Zhang Xiongnan has been stopped in accordance with the Provincial Government's telegram order and ceased fire on the 4th. Zhang is based in Dehua, and Hong is based in Yongchun. Xiao Jing spoke to news reporters in Quanzhou on the 8th, roughly saying that the Provincial Government has limited the people's militia in the province to seven regiments in principle. It has been decided to organize the people's militia in southern Fujian into five regiments. The first phase counts and organizes Hong Wende (Peng Tang, Chen Peiyu, Chen Yucai, Liu Chaoran are all included), Zhang Xiongnan, Lin Jing and other troops belonging to Quanzhou, Yongchun, and Xingren. The second phase counts and organizes Yang Fengnian's troops belonging to Zhangzhou. The third phase counts various people's militia in western Fujian. The organization of the people's militia takes the regiment as the highest unit, named "Fujian Provincial Security Team, Number X Regiment," according to the infantry organization. Below the regiment are battalions and companies. Each company is limited to 90 guns. The standard for counting is guns. Foreign-made, Hanyang-made, and Guangdong-made guns are considered qualified. Min-made, short guns, and miscellaneous guns are not qualified. After counting, the second step is to organize the committee, the third step is to organize training, and the fourth step is to transfer the garrison. The remaining people's militia will either have their guns purchased and be dismissed, or be dealt with in other appropriate ways. The salaries of the security team will be issued by the provincial treasury and will no longer be obtained from other sources. The Bao Wei Tuan is funded locally. Currently, the provincial government has decided to allocate 180,000 yuan per month from foreign rice tax for security regiment expenses. In addition, Xiao Qian, deputy director of the Provincial Security Department, flew from the province to Xiamen on the 7th. Xiao Jing came to Xiamen from Quanzhou on the same day to meet Xiao Qian, asking for instructions on counting the people's militia in Quanzhou. Xiao Qian then went to Zhangzhou on the 8th and to Nanjing on the 9th to inspect Yang Fengnian's people's militia, summoning officers above the rank of major for training. He returned to Zhangzhou in the afternoon. According to Zhangzhou military intelligence, Yang Fengnian's troops will be organized into three regiments and four independent battalions, with each regiment having twelve infantry companies (each company with 81 guns), one machine gun company, one mortar company, one medical team, and one communications platoon. According to news from Yang Fengnian, the regimental and battalion commanders have been appointed, but they have not been formally counted by the Provincial Government, so the Provincial Government has not appointed them.

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Returns to Hankou</h3>
<p>—Plans for Bandit Suppression and Aftermath Determined in Jiangxi—</p>
<p>—Scheduled to Summon and Train Generals Arriving in Hankou—</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Bandit Suppression for the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, accompanied by Shen Honglie and He Zhuguo, took the Wuxue steamer to Xunyang on the 7th. On the morning of the 8th, they changed to a special train on the Nanxun Road to the south, arriving in Nanchang at 2:00 PM. He spent several days consulting with Chairman Chiang on the aftermath of bandit suppression in the three provinces, deciding on concrete plans. At 12:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th, Zhang and others departed from Nanchang to return to Hankou. They arrived in Xunyang at 8:00 AM on the 13th and immediately boarded the Yong Sui warship with staff members Tang Guozhen, Tan Hai, Li Tiancai, and He Wenxu to sail upstream. Shen Honglie and He Zhuguo took another merchant ship westward. The Yong Sui warship arrived in Hankou at 10:30 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, docking at the Sanbei pier. He Chengjuan, Wan Fulin, Wang Yizhe, Qian Dagou, Zeng Yiding, Ye Peng, and the division commanders from the Northeast who came to Hankou, Liu Duoquan, Liu Handong, Guo Xipeng, Dong Yingbin, Zhang Decheng, and Zhu Hongxun, all welcomed him at the wharf. After disembarking, Zhang went to the headquarters to rest. Due to the fatigue of the journey, Tang Guozhen was specially sent to meet the reporters. According to him, Mr. Zhang's trip to Jiangxi lasted a week. He met with Chairman Chiang every day in Nanchang. Concrete plans have been made regarding future military affairs and the aftermath of bandit suppression in the three provinces. After returning to Hankou, he may go to the bandit area for inspection, but the time cannot be predetermined. The rumor that a headquarters will be established in Hankou is definitely not true. The generals from North China who were summoned to Jiangxi by telegram from Chiang have been concentrated in Beiping and are heading south. Those who arrived in Hankou on the 13th include: Huang Jie, commander of the Second Division, Liu Handong, commander of the 107th Division, Liu Duoquan, commander of the 105th Division, Guo Xipeng, commander of the 4th Cavalry Division, Feng Zhian, commander of the 37th Division, Zhang Zizhong, commander of the 38th Division, Dong Yingbin, commander of the 118th Division, Zhang Decheng, commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, Zhu Hongxun, commander of the 130th Division, Huang Guanghua, commander of the 139th Division, and brigade commanders Liang Kai, Li Jintian, and Fu Chun. Together with Yang Zhengzhi, commander of the 108th Division, Zhang Tingshu, commander of the 112th Division, Zhou Fucheng, commander of the 129th Division, and Huang Xiansheng, commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division, who arrived in Hankou on the 11th, there are more than ten people in total. Except for Huang Jie, Feng Zhian, Zhang Zizhong, Huang Guanghua, Li Jintian, and Fu Chun, who took the Jiangxin steamer east at 8:00 PM on the 13th, the rest stayed in Hankou to wait for Zhang. It is said that Zhang is scheduled to summon and train the division and brigade commanders on the 14th. After listening to the training, the division and brigade commanders will take the steamer to Jiangxi that evening. These are all the first batch summoned from the provinces of Hebei and Chahar. As for the second batch summoned to Jiangxi, there are 13 people: Division Commanders Feng Zhanhai, Li Xingcun, Miao Chengliu, Sun Dequan, He Lizhong, Wu Keren, Li Zhentang, Chen Guanqun, Du Jiwu, Bai Fengxiang, Guan Linzheng, Yao Dongfan, and Wang Qifeng. There are nine brigade commanders: Huang Weigang, Xia Ziming, Li Zengzhi, Wang Zhibang, Huang Yongan, Huo Shouyi, Wang Hehua, Zheng Dongguo, and Qiao Fang. They are scheduled to gather in Beiping in late March and concentrate in Nanchang before the 31st. The third batch summoned to Jiangxi includes Division Commanders Zhao Dengyu, Liu Ruming, and Chang Jingwu, and Brigade Commanders Tong Zeguang, Wang Xishan, Liu Zizhen, Gao Pengyun, Luo Qi, and Zhang Yao, totaling six people. They are scheduled to gather in Beiping in early April and concentrate in Nanchang before the 15th of next month. All have decided to visit Zhang when passing through Hankou. The division and brigade commanders from Shaanxi and Shandong have also set off separately. As for the two army commanders, Wang Yizhe and Wan Fulin, and Army Commander He Zhuguo, who are staying in Hankou, they are all planning to stay for a few more days before returning north to their defensive positions.

<h3>Opening of Wuxian Agricultural Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>—Location: Zhiyuan in the South of the City—</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 12th) was the 9th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death and Arbor Day. The Jiangsu Provincial Rice Experiment Field, in conjunction with the Wuxian Agricultural Extension Institute, took advantage of school holidays to hold a three-day agricultural products cooperation exhibition at Zhiyuan in the south of the city. The weather was fine that day, and people from all walks of life flocked to visit the exhibition. At 9:00 AM, the opening ceremony was held in the auditorium. First, the chairman, representing the county magistrate, performed the ceremony. Then, Director Song reported on the opening situation. Next, a representative of the Party Headquarters took the stage to give a speech, with pointed and insightful remarks, criticizing many weaknesses of the current society. Subsequently, trees were planted and photographs were taken in the garden before dispersing. Agricultural and sericultural achievements were displayed in two rooms. Agricultural products mainly consisted of rice and mulberry tree specimens, as well as diagrams and tables of forestry, livestock, and poultry, all displayed in the auditorium. Sericultural achievements mainly consisted of products produced in various villages in the Wuxian district over the years, supplemented by silkworm disease models, microscopes, and various silk products, all displayed in the Panxi Jingshe. Various specimens were hung on all four sides of the corridor, providing a lot for China's agricultural sector to learn from. It is reported that various educational groups will also visit the exhibition in the next two days.</p>
<h3>Appeal Dismissed in Medicinal Property Lawsuit</h3>
<p>—Shandong High Court Upholds Original Judgment—</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Wang Shilang, a third-generation traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from Qingdao, was involved in a lawsuit because he used ginseng and wulingzhi together to treat postpartum blood disorders in a woman, and the patient died several days later. The Qingdao court ruled that Wang was not proficient in the medicinal properties of herbs, their roles in a prescription, and that his negligence in practice led to the death of the patient. He was sentenced to a fine of 100 yuan. Wang did not accept the ruling and appealed to the Shandong High Court. The court session was held on the 5th of this month, and the debate concluded. The verdict was announced on the 8th, dismissing the appeal. Wang still intends to continue the appeal. The verdict was announced today, and its text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Shandong High Court Criminal Verdict: Appellant Wang Shilang, attorney Zhou Feng (lawyer), the above appellant, in the case of causing death due to negligence in practice, did not accept the first instance judgment of the Qingdao District Court of the Republic of China on January 11, 1934, and filed an appeal. The verdict of this court is as follows:</p>
<p>Main text: The appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>Facts: Wang Shilang has been practicing medicine for a long time. On August 21, 1933, he treated Ms. Hou Zhang for her illness. Due to his shallow knowledge and lack of attention, he mistakenly used ginseng and wulingzhi, which are incompatible, together, causing Ms. Hou Zhang's illness to worsen. She died on the night of the 26th of the same month. Ms. Hou Liu filed a lawsuit that was investigated and prosecuted by the prosecutor.</p>
<p>Reasons: According to Ms. Hou Liu's statement, her daughter-in-law (Ms. Hou Zhang) fell ill 21 days after giving birth, suffering from headaches. She took the medicine at 11:00 AM. After taking the medicine, she could not speak. She used her hands to grab her stomach. She died at 6:00 PM yesterday (August 26, 1933). Hou Xueyi also stated that Ms. Hou Zhang asked the doctor on August 11 or 12. At 2:00 PM, she could not speak, and her stomach became bloated. She could not pass stool or urine. The doctor said that he could not give her medicine because two of the herbs in the prescription were incompatible, as evidenced by You Xiaoting's statement that the prescription contained wulingzhi and Korean ginseng, and that ginseng and wulingzhi are dangerous together (probably a mistake for the word "wèi" meaning to fear, or to be incompatible), and should not be prescribed together. Ms. Hou Zhang's stomach became bloated, and she could not pass stool or urine or speak after taking the medicine, which was obviously caused by the medicine's effects. The appellant admitted that he prescribed the medicine. Not only did he not describe the illness in the prescription, but he also did not record the pulse. During the investigation and trial, he repeatedly claimed that it was postpartum blood deficiency, postpartum blood blockage, or postpartum blood stasis. When asked if there was an external infection, he replied that there was an external infection. When asked how he knew there was an external infection, he replied that she had a headache because of blood stasis, her body was dry, her pulse was wiry and turbid, and her skin was cold. It is clear that he did not pay attention to the cause of Ms. Hou Zhang's illness. Without identifying the illness, he prescribed ginseng and wulingzhi, which are incompatible, causing her illness to worsen. He was unable to cure her and she died. The original judgment stated that the appellant caused death due to negligence in practice and, according to Article 191, Paragraph 2, and Article 55, Paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code, sentenced him to a fine of 100 yuan, with compulsory execution. If he fails to pay, it will be converted to imprisonment at a rate of one yuan per day (omitting Article 55, Paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code), which is appropriate. The appellant's arguments are all evasive and cannot be said to be reasonable. Based on the above reasoning, in accordance with Article 384 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. Prosecutor Li Changfu performed his duties in court in this case. The court of appeal is the Supreme Court, and the appeal deadline is 10 days, starting from the date of delivery of the judgment. March 9, 1934, Presiding Judge Gao Xianzhuo, Judge Wang Shirun, Judge Zhang Kun, Criminal Third Tribunal, Shandong High Court." (March 10)</p>

<h3>Robbery in Lukou Lujiazhuang</h3>
<p>Five bandits arrived at Lujiazhuang, Lukou Township, at 2:00 AM on the 13th and wantonly robbed the home of Zhu Dexing, a villager. They severely injured Zhu's wife, Gong, and mother, Cao, on their heads and waists with iron bars. The total loss is estimated to be over 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Raising Funds for the Construction of the Su-Chang Road</h3>
<p>The survey and mapping of the Su-Chang Road have been completed, and construction will begin soon. However, 140,000 yuan is needed. After submitting a request to the province for allocation, instructions were received yesterday (the 14th) that the National Economic Commission cannot allocate funds because the road is not listed in the budget. The provincial department also has no funds to subsidize it. In addition to the 70,000 yuan, half the required amount, that has been borrowed by the county, the remaining 70,000 yuan will also be raised by the county government, and construction will begin soon.</p>

<h3>Small Boat Collision Injures Ticket Seller</h3>
<p>The Xin'an small boat in Xinchang Township travels back and forth between Xinkai and Xiasha and other places four times a day. The boat owner, Ye Zhou, recently found that the boat had few passengers and used more fuel, fearing that it would be difficult to maintain. He rented another Huikang small boat to operate as usual. The original boat was rented to Zhou Xiaodi, who sold tickets on the boat. However, because they were on the same route, disputes often arose, and resentment deepened. At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, the Huikang boat arrived in Xiasha and was suddenly collided with by the Xin'an boat. Fortunately, no accident occurred. Unexpectedly, at 3:00 PM the same afternoon, after the Huikang boat arrived in Xiasha, the stern was broken by the Xin'an boat's collision. Ye Zhou and the ticket seller A Haosheng went to Zhou Xiaodi to argue, but Zhou Xiaodi used a three-foot-long iron bar to hit the ticket seller into the river, causing serious injuries. After being rescued, he reported to the local security regiment, which took Zhou Xiaodi into custody and transferred him to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Tax Collector Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Xu Jigong, director of the local slaughter tax collection office, has been repeatedly accused by local people, including Hu Chao, to the Provincial Education Fund Management Office of embezzling public funds and engaging in private wrongdoing. Recently, Mao Jinshan, a local resident, stated that the supplementary tax collected in June, July, August, and the first half of September of the 21st year totaled more than 13,000 yuan in the county. However, the director underreported the amount, claiming that slaughterers were in arrears, but in reality, he pocketed the money. Gu Yunpeng, a member sent by the province, also sent a telegram from Yancheng to Wuxi last year, reporting the supplementary tax revenue to the province and county at one-third of the actual amount, openly engaging in fraud and colluding with Lian Shaoshan and others. Therefore, yesterday, he specially submitted a petition to the Provincial Education Fund Management Office, requesting a thorough investigation and strict prosecution.</p>
<h3>Strange News of a Sow Giving Birth to an Elephant</h3>
<p>Shen, a resident of Xijie Village, Yuqi Township (Qingcheng City), District 15 in the county, had a sow that suddenly gave birth to an elephant at 8:00 AM on the 13th. It was black in color with a long nose, and its head resembled an elephant, while its lower body was that of a pig. It died soon after. Villagers who heard the news went to see it, causing a traffic jam. It was then taken by Chongwen Elementary School in the town, soaked in medicinal water, and displayed in the school for people to visit. It is indeed a strange occurrence.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<h3>Street Sweeper Strangled to Death</h3>
<p>Old Liu, a street sweeper in Wu Yi Bu Tou Town, for unknown reasons, suddenly died in the night by strangulation. The County Court, upon receiving the report, dispatched Prosecutor Guan Junjie at 8 PM on the 12th to conduct an inquest. He stayed overnight in the town. At approximately 6 AM on the 13th, he arrived at the scene of the death and ordered the coroner to perform an autopsy according to the law. The autopsy revealed that the death was indeed caused by strangulation. If it were a suicide by hanging, there would not have been rope marks all around the neck, and fresh blood would not have been vomited from the mouth. Prosecutor Guan, considering the case involved human life, began an investigation in the town and discovered that the case involved an affair. He ordered the police to summon five individuals involved: Ma San, Yi Gongliang, Qu Zhongbao, Chen Daguanzi, and Fu Shusheng. Ma San’s daughter, who was allegedly intimate with Old Liu, had fled. After interrogation, he ordered that all be taken to the city for further investigation and prosecution.</p>

<h3>Court Orders Exhumation for Revenge Killing Inquest</h3>
<p>Huang Shengkang, a detective from Shanghai, who lived in Chuan Gang, was suddenly assassinated by an enemy last month upon returning to Tong. His family reported to the court, but without waiting for the prosecutor to arrive for an inquest, they proceeded with the encoffining. Chief Prosecutor Liu has now sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to seal and transport the coffin to the city for exhumation and inquest.</p>
<p>Qingjiang</p>
<h3>Two Kidnapping Cases Outside the City</h3>
<p>The residents inside and outside Huaiyin City are somewhat panicked due to the change of guard between the stationed army and the Provincial Security Team. However, the area outside the city is vast, making it difficult for the military and police to provide adequate protection. Yesterday (the 10th) after 6 PM, several bandits went to the home of Zhang Wenyuan in Tangzi Alley, north of the city. They first brandished handguns to intimidate Zhang’s family and prevent them from making noise, then abducted Zhang Wenyuan from the back door. This was discovered by Ding, the company commander of the mountain artillery unit of the Provincial Security Team stationed nearby, who immediately led his troops in pursuit. Zhang was shot and dropped by the bandits outside Beiwei, and had already been wounded by gunfire. At the same time, bandits also went to the Zhao Hengxing lumberyard at Yangqiaokou and kidnapped Zhao Huanzhi’s young daughter. By the time the military and police arrived to pursue and suppress them, the bandits had disappeared.</p>

<h3>Police Team Recovers Kidnapping Victim</h3>
<p>Hu Zhushou Peng, of the police squad stationed in Gou Dun Town, received a report yesterday that bandits were hiding a kidnapping victim in Tianjia She. He immediately dispatched a team to investigate and recovered one victim, while the bandits had already fled. It is reported that the victim is Yuan Guangqian’s son, who was kidnapped by bandits last winter. The team has already presented the victim to the brigade headquarters, awaiting identification by his family.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Sun Fo Flew to Nanchang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Kong to stay for one or two days before returning to Beijing via Shanghai.</p>
<p>To discuss central financial matters with Chiang.</p>
<p>Sun Fo, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, upon invitation from Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, jointly flew to Jiangxi yesterday morning aboard a Ford aircraft. They will discuss important issues such as central finance and the reorganization of southwestern politics. A reporter from the New News Agency learned from the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance that Kong sent a telegram to Shanghai immediately after flying to Jiangxi from Beijing, stating, "We arrived safely in Nanchang at 1 PM today (the 14th). We plan to stay in Jiangxi for one or two days before returning to Beijing via Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Visited Dai Jitao again yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Departed at the beginning of the month to inspect the Northwest.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, in order to finalize the development plans for the Northwest, decided to go to the Northwest with Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, for an on-the-spot inspection. Song and Dai had met once in Shanghai to discuss everything. Song visited Dai’s residence on Avenue Haig at about 10 AM yesterday morning for further discussions, and left after an hour. It is reported that it has been largely decided that they will depart at the beginning of next month. The inspection location will be centered on Shaanxi. Other places such as Gansu and Qinghai can only be determined after arriving in Shaanxi due to transportation and war conditions. Song took the night train to Beijing last night to ask the central government for instructions. After returning to Shanghai and making some preparations, he can set off.</p>
<h3>Temporary Alert Yesterday</h3>
<p>Strict precautions at the border between the Chinese and foreign concessions.</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that yesterday was the anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet government by the Communists. The police authorities of the Chinese and foreign concessions in the city, fearing that the Communist elements would take the opportunity to disrupt public order during this time of thriving labor unrest, specially announced a temporary alert for one day. At major roads along the Chinese and foreign concession borders in the southern city, double posts were added. Inspectors and detectives, along with plainclothes inspectors, conducted strict inspections of suspicious pedestrians in the Ximen area. Precautions were especially strict in the Caojiadu area in western Shanghai. The French Concession authorities paid even more attention to preventing disturbances in various places due to the Mei Ya factory strike. All detectives were stationed in areas bordering the Chinese and foreign concessions to maintain peace within the concession.</p>
<p>Fujian Party Affairs Instructor</p>
<h3>Chen Zhaoying Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to take a ship to Fujian on the 17th to take office.</p>
<p>The design committee has been finalized and will be announced today.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Chen Zhaoying, the special envoy of the central government to serve as the Fujian Party Affairs Instructor, arrived in Beijing from his native place in the Pujiang area a few days ago to ask the central government for instructions. He completed his official business at 11 PM the night before last and took a night train to Shanghai with his entourage, Zhao Weimin. He arrived at the North Station at 7:30 AM yesterday morning and went to his hotel to rest. Chen is scheduled to take the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Chefoo to Fujian on the 17th to take office. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chen at his hotel yesterday and was given the following statement:</p>
<h3>Steps to Reorganize Party Affairs in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>According to Chen, party affairs in Fujian Province have been completely suspended since the outbreak of the Fujian Rebellion. After arriving, he will first meet with the Fujian Province Party Affairs Design Committee to start organizing lower-level party branches. Once the party organization is sound, he will convene a provincial representative assembly to elect members to the provincial party headquarters and supervisory committee, and establish a formal party headquarters. The task of himself and the Fujian Province Party Affairs Design Committee will end after the provincial party headquarters is established.</p>
<h3>Design Committee Members to Be Announced Today</h3>
<p>The number of members of the Fujian Province Party Affairs Design Committee is seven, with an additional secretary-general. The candidates have already been internally decided: Zheng Zuyin, Chen Meian, Fang Zhongzheng, Tang Deming, Zhu Wanlin, Zhan Xiaohuan, and Xie Dongshan as committee members, and Zhao Weimin as secretary-general. Today (the 15th), the list will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for approval and formal announcement.</p>
<h3>Contacting Military and Government Officials to Jointly Plan Construction</h3>
<p>In the past, party affairs in Fujian did not have special achievements. In the future, he will encourage party comrades to unite sincerely, break down regional prejudices, and make the party, government, and military work together towards construction. Fujian was originally a wealthy place, but years of chaos and heavy taxes have caused resources to be abandoned underground, and no one dares to develop them. In the future, efforts must be made to stabilize society so that overseas Chinese can invest in Fujian with peace of mind and develop resources. In ten years, Fujian will be wealthy and the party can be the best in the country.</p>
<h3>Mr. Hu Zhantang Will Not Leave Hong Kong Temporarily</h3>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked whether recent rumors that Mr. Hu Zhantang was about to go to Beijing were true. Chen said that during this time of serious national crisis, Mr. Hu Zhantang will go to Beijing sooner or later to share the burden, but he has not heard of the rumors that Mr. Hu is "about" to go to Beijing, and it is probably too early to say so. Although he has not had contact with Mr. Hu recently, Mr. Hu is probably still living in Hong Kong and will not go to Beijing immediately.</p>
<h3>Cotton Mills to Reduce Working Hours</h3>
<p>Decision made to implement starting in June.</p>
<p>Methods to be decided at another meeting.</p>
<p>The cotton spinning industry has been declining in recent years. Since last year, cotton mills have been reducing working hours or suspending operations from time to time. The phenomenon of cheap yarn and expensive cotton has not been resolved, and the industry is in increasingly dire straits. Stagnant yarn sales are especially painful for businesses. Various Chinese-owned yarn mills in this city and other ports, seeing this situation, must quickly seek unanimous relief, otherwise they will be plunged into a desperate situation. A discussion meeting was convened yesterday afternoon to discuss both palliative and fundamental solutions. More than 40 mills attended, with Rong Zongjing as chairman. The following methods were decided: (1) Starting this month, if the yarn produced by each mill is directly or indirectly delivered to the exchange, the mill will be responsible for taking it back in the month following the delivery. The penalties for violating this resolution will be discussed and decided at another meeting next Wednesday. (2) Starting on June 1, each mill will reduce working hours to reduce production. The methods will be decided at another meeting. There are currently 58 yarn mills in this city and other ports, with approximately 1.1 million spindles. It has been decided to implement the reduction in working hours starting on June 1.</p>
<p>Special District</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Owners Held a General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Establishment of a design committee to plan rickshaw pullers' relief.</p>
<p>Send representatives to negotiate with the Public Works Department to improve harsh penalties.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after the Public Works Department's Human-Powered Vehicle Committee suggested to the Public Works Department that it should take back 2,000 public rickshaws in the Special District, reduce rental prices, provide relief to rickshaw pullers, and establish a new company to change the way licenses are issued, the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association's Special District Office believed that this measure would have a significant impact on the industry's operations and the livelihood of rickshaw owners. Therefore, it held a general meeting of all operators in the Special District at 10 AM yesterday at the city's Chamber of Commerce auditorium to discuss countermeasures. The meeting adjourned at about 1 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Meeting Proceedings</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 813 rickshaw operators and owners attended the meeting. Zhang Huaiyang, representative of the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association, and Chen Guoliang, representative of the rickshaw pullers' union, attended as observers. After the meeting was called to order, Yin Zhiling, Liang Ruiting, Gu Songmao, Zheng Jiansan, and Liu Zhenqiu were elected as the presidium of the meeting. After the formalities, Presidium Member Gu Songmao reported the purpose of the meeting, Yin Zhiling reported on the negotiations with the Public Works Department authorities, and Liu Zhenqiu read the general assembly's declaration, which was unanimously approved. The discussion of the motions then began. The atmosphere at the meeting was tense, and it adjourned at 1 PM.</p>

It was decided that Yin and Gu would be responsible for the above two motions.</p>
<h3>Sending Representatives to Negotiate</h3>
<p>In addition to appointing Yin Zhiling and Gu Songmao to go to the Public Works Department's Traffic Committee for negotiations at 4 PM yesterday, the association also prepared a petition and submitted it to the Public Works Department. The document stated, "To the Public Works Department, the rickshaw owners held a general meeting of all operators at the city's Chamber of Commerce auditorium on the 14th of this month. They had extensive discussions on improving rickshaws, providing relief to rickshaw pullers, and appropriately reducing and standardizing rental prices. In addition to issuing a declaration, there are also (1)</p>
<p>Recently, the Public Works Department's vehicle inspection office has been excessively harsh, detaining licenses for as long as one day or three days to two weeks for any defects in the vehicles. This not only forces rickshaw owners to suspend operations but also deprives rickshaw pullers of their livelihoods. Please allow fines to be imposed on the spot to avoid losses for both rickshaw owners and pullers. (2) When rickshaw pullers are operating, they are often insulted by constables on false pretenses and subjected to harsh penalties, such as license detention. Since rickshaw owners must improve and provide relief, the authorities should also make necessary corrections. The above situations must be improved. The relevant cases have been recorded and a letter is attached, along with the declaration, for your review. We respectfully request that you adopt and implement these measures, which would be in the public interest." All of this was unanimously approved on file.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>The awarding of merits and the punishment of demerits are inherently within the purview of the authorities' governance, and any changes in policy should be based on reasonable and justifiable measures. Recently, upon reviewing the report of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Public Ricksha Committee published in the SMC Gazette Special Edition of February 23rd of this year, we find that the contributions of the Public Ricksha Industry Association of the Special District have been entirely disregarded. Instead, the Committee relies on incomplete and inaccurate investigations, or even manipulative statements and fabricated accusations, as the basis for its report. Consequently, the Committee recklessly speculates that existing ricksha owners lack any sincerity in improving their vehicles or assisting ricksha pullers. It even proposes to revoke two thousand of the currently licensed rickshas annually from January 1, 1935, and transfer them to a new company whose organization and all conditions are to be approved and controlled by the SMC. We ask, is this kind of proposal in accordance with legal principles or even human sentiment? Ricksha owners unanimously and resolutely oppose this proposal. Their reasons for opposition, in addition to the Special District Office having already pointed out the inaccuracies in the Committee's report regarding the total number of rickshas, total license fees, costs and expenses, net profits of ricksha owners, and the extreme deterioration of vehicles, and submitting these points to the SMC authorities, are as follows: (1) The report proposes that the organization of the new company should be controlled by the SMC, which is incomprehensible. Since ricksha owners obtained their licenses, they have been operating in accordance with the regulations, with every action and every matter under the strict control of the SMC. Has the Public Ricksha Committee failed to hear of this? (2) The Special District Office has dispatched four cleaning inspectors to inspect the streets daily. When substandard rickshas are found, they are required to be repaired and cleaned. Moreover, tea is provided in the summer, rice in the winter, and three branch and main epidemic hospitals have been established. These improvements to rickshas and assistance to ricksha pullers are all initiated by the ricksha owners themselves. If the SMC wishes to promote and expand these efforts, it should provide clear instructions. If, after repeated orders and appeals, the ricksha owners are unable to accept them within a feasible range, it would not be too late to transfer the business. However, the current vague proposition clearly demonstrates prejudice. (3) According to Article 21 of the SMC License Regulations, licenses may be revoked or temporarily suspended for violations of the regulations. Based on this, there must be a violation of the regulations before there is a risk of license revocation. If punishment is unjustly inflicted, how can the ricksha owners willingly accept it? (4) Even in the event of occasional violations of the regulations, the license revocation must be determined by court judgment. It is noted that, within the industry, ten licenses have been revoked twice, and despite requests from various parties, the authorities have consistently refused to issue new licenses to others. The report's suggestion that the SMC suspend two thousand licenses after December 31, 1934, and allow others to apply for a license to operate is inconsistent with established regulations. (5) At the request of one or two Westerners, regardless of their involvement in the ricksha industry, the Public Ricksha Committee proposes to deprive all ricksha owners, numbering in the thousands, of their legal right to operate a livelihood. If implemented, this would not only harm the ricksha industry, but also set a precedent that could affect all licensed businesses operated by Chinese merchants in the Settlement, causing everyone to feel threatened. (6) It is particularly important to solemnly declare that the Public Ricksha Committee believes that there is a fact of buying and selling rickshas or license plates, and points out that the price of a ricksha ranges from over one hundred yuan to seven hundred and fifty yuan, and the price of a license plate is six hundred and fifty yuan. Although this issue was raised as a question by the representative of the Special District Office in a document submitted to the SMC, if it is not clarified, it may become a matter of suspicion. Public rickshas are operated by independent owners, leased operators, or those who represent or entrust others. There has never been any buying and selling of rickshas. Moreover, license plates are issued by the SMC for operation and are subject to strict regulations, unlike private property that can be freely disposed of. It would be foolish for ricksha owners to create trouble for themselves in this way. In short, things cry out when they are treated unfairly. Since ricksha owners have been operating public rickshas, all losses incurred from the previous changes in ricksha design and wheel modifications have been set aside for the time being. Beginning in 1924, the number of rickshas was first increased and then reduced, resulting in a one-third reduction in the number of qualified rickshas and a one-third increase in the cost of building a ricksha. During the 1928 Northern Expedition and the 1932 Shanghai Incident, traffic was sometimes cut off, and special curfews were imposed, lasting for several months. The ricksha business plummeted. These circumstances are known to all. In addition, in recent years, buses and trams have covered all the roads, and our public rickshas are frequently stopped, which has become commonplace. Moreover, from April to September each year, ricksha pullers return to their hometowns to farm, and most rickshas are idle, which goes without saying. However, the Public Ricksha Committee disregards the various hardships and direct and indirect expenses of ricksha owners. Instead, it only listens to false accusations and exaggerations, and proposes to transfer the business of the majority of people to a new company. Ricksha owners cannot help but urgently and loudly point out the errors in the report and list their reasons for opposition for the world to see. We earnestly request that all sectors of society, based on fairness and justice, make reasonable and appropriate comments and provide assistance so that the hard-earned money of ricksha owners can be spared from unnecessary and significant losses. This should be extended to all licensed businesses, so that they are not similarly affected. However, many ricksha owners have vehicles and licenses that they have acquired through hard work and are well aware of the pains and hardships of ricksha pullers. Now, at the time of the general assembly of all ricksha owners, we will jointly discuss improving ricksha designs to make them easier for ricksha pullers to pull, and the methods of assisting ricksha pullers to improve their lives. We hereby formulate the following articles: A. The Special District Office will send representatives to request the SMC to reissue ten vacant licenses before July of this year to manufacture a standard public ricksha as a model for testing and improving vehicles. B. From January 1, 1935, public rickshas will be gradually improved in accordance with the approved test rickshas. C. A public ricksha pullers' hospital will be established in a central location in the city, with wards capable of accommodating 200 people, as well as complete Chinese and Western medicine and equipment. It is resolved that construction will commence on April 1, 1934, and be completed by January 1, 1935. D. Starting on the same date as item C, four new public ricksha pullers' villages will be constructed, located in the east, south, west, and north of Shanghai. The completion date will be the same as item C. In addition, four new ricksha pullers' villages will be built annually, completing 20 new public ricksha pullers' villages by December 31, 1939, capable of accommodating 20,000 ricksha pullers. E. A Ricksha Pullers' Hospital and New Village Construction Committee will be established, with representatives selected by the Special District Office and representatives from the three local authorities of this city invited to participate for supervision. The construction costs will be borne on average by the ricksha owners of the Special District, and the municipal authorities and charitable organizations will be requested to provide assistance. F. Each ricksha pullers' village must have at least 1,000 dormitory rooms for ricksha pullers, as well as public bathrooms, cooperative dining halls, classrooms, and assembly halls to facilitate ricksha pullers' education and hygiene. G. Ricksha pullers residing in the new villages may directly solicit business from various ricksha companies. The rental portion of their rickshas will be reduced appropriately. (1) The amount will be set to ensure uniformity. (2) The lessee receives one-quarter of the rental price to maintain their livelihood and is not allowed to demand additional payments. In short, the rental price should be in line with the situation so that all parties do not feel unfairly treated. In addition to submitting the above measures to the authorities for review and approval, and requesting that two representatives be sent to participate in meetings so that ricksha owners can effectively improve rickshas and provide assistance to maintain the ricksha industry, this declaration is hereby made for your consideration.</p>
<p>Japanese Envoy</p>
<h3>Scheduled to Return Home Early Next Month</h3>
<p>Ariyoshi Discusses the Pending Issues Between China and Japan</p>
<p>Negotiations Still Unlikely to Proceed</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Mr. Ariyoshi, Counselor of the Japanese Legation in China, told the Central News Agency reporter who visited him yesterday morning that Minister Ariyoshi is scheduled to return to Japan in early April, but the exact date has not yet been determined. This trip back to Japan is not for any important task, but merely to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the situation in China. It is said that Japanese officials stationed abroad must return to Japan once a year. Rumors that the Japanese envoy's return to Japan this time was at the summons of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc., are not accurate. The Legation has not yet received such instructions. The Japanese envoy also plans to visit Nanjing before returning home to bid farewell to President Wang and others. As for the Sino-Japanese issue, although there has been much speculation in recent days, it is all unreliable. All pending issues between China and Japan have not yet been negotiated by both sides. Although the situation between China and Japan seems to be easing on the surface, in fact, there is still no possibility of proceeding with negotiations on all pending issues. In other words, it is not yet the time to discuss Sino-Japanese issues. Ariyoshi went on to say that Mr. Tomita, a Japanese financial official, has been in China for many days and is now scheduled to return home today before taking up his new post in the United States. Tomita was dispatched to Shanghai to investigate the current economic situation in China and the trade situation of Japanese residents in China.</p>
<h3>Xu Shaodi Left for Europe Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Investigate Construction and Cooperation Enterprises in Various Countries</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Shaodi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department, left for Europe on the Italian postal ship Conte Verde at 7:00 yesterday morning under the orders of the Construction Committee to investigate construction and cooperation enterprises in various countries. He is scheduled to return to China next year. After Mr. Xu's departure, the position of Standing Committee Member of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department that he vacated has been replaced by Mr. Fang Qingru.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Slightly Ill with a Cold</h3>
<p>Did Not Go to the Municipal Government Office Yesterday</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Mayor Wu Tiecheng has a slight cold, so he has not been to the office since yesterday. He has not yet recovered yesterday and is still resting at home. He will recover in a day or two and then go to the office as usual.</p>
<p>The China East News Agency reports that foreign telegrams yesterday claimed that Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai may be transferred to head the Guangdong Provincial Government or the Guangzhou Municipal Government. This news came from Guangzhou, so many outside believe it to be reliable. However, the Municipal Government officially declared to reporters from the China East News Agency yesterday that this rumor is absolutely untrue. According to Mr. Guo Shen, Secretary of the Municipal Government, not only is there no such rumor in Shanghai, but the Municipal Government has not received any news of it. Therefore, the brewing of this kind of atmosphere is very inexplicable.</p>

<h3>Temporary Suspension</h3>
<p>The New Voice reporter learned from banking circles in Shanghai yesterday that 4.4 million yuan of the Ministry of Finance's loan of 44 million yuan, one-eleventh of the total, will be retained by the syndicate to temporarily pay the interest due on the loan if the surplus of customs revenue is insufficient to pay the interest. The disbursement of funds by each bank will be without any deductions. The syndicate will issue the securities at par. The loan interest rate is 8% per month, and the securities interest rate is 6% per week. The loan term is 15 years, and the securities term is 6 years. The syndicate, which has undertaken the loan, has scheduled to disburse the funds to the Ministry of Finance within four months from the 1st of this month, but the issuance of securities by the syndicate has recently been temporarily suspended due to a certain issue, so it is still uncertain whether the issuance will be approved on April 15th.</p>
<h3>French Consul General Returns Home Without Taking Leave</h3>
<p>There have been rumors recently that Mr. Merillon, the French Consul General in Shanghai, is about to return home on leave. According to news from the French Consulate, Mr. Merillon has no plans to return home on leave, which shows that the rumors are groundless.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<h3>"Outline of Rayon Manufacturing Methods"</h3>
<p>Rayon is a major invention of the 19th-century chemical industry and is now an important raw material for human clothing. Its position in international trade is increasingly important. In terms of output, the United States, Britain, and Japan are the most productive, while Italy and France are the leading exporters. China's consumption of rayon has consistently been over one million dan in recent years, several times more than silk. The outflow of money is incalculable. Therefore, establishing factories to manufacture rayon to stem the outflow is essential. However, due to the lack of both talent and capital, although this idea has been advocated, it has not yet been realized. Mr. Pan Xiaochun studied chemical engineering in Japan in his early years. Since returning to China, he has been employed at the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory. Based on his knowledge and experience, he recently compiled the book "Outline of Rayon Manufacturing Methods," which has been published by the factory's publishing department (Wufu Lane, Tianjin Road). (Priced at half a yuan in national currency.) The book thoroughly explores the history of rayon invention and its manufacturing methods, analyzing them in great detail. It also focuses on comparing various manufacturing methods and judging their properties to distinguish their merits and demerits. This book is unprecedented in China's publishing industry. All silk merchants and chemical researchers should have a copy to study.</p>
<p>Northern and Southern Cities Bean and Rice Industry</p>
<h3>Calibration of New Standard Measures Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Eliminate Malpractices in the Industry and Ensure Fair Business</p>
<p>Over 1,600 Measures Submitted by Various Businesses for Calibration</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that since the new system of weights and measures was actively promoted and implemented by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs in 1931, the grain, bean, and rice industries in this city were the first to adopt it, abolishing the old "hai hu" and "sheng dou." Yesterday morning at 9:00, the Bean and Rice Industry Association held a spring calibration of the measures currently used by various businesses in the northern and southern cities at Cuixiu Hall. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Supervisory Personnel: The supervisory personnel who attended yesterday included Huang Yongping from the Weights and Measures Verification Office of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, Standing Committee Members Zhu Zixiang and Yan Xiaoquan, Cai Yukun, Fu Qiangeng, and Chen Yuzhao representing the rice merchants in the southern city, Lu Jingwen and Qiang Zisheng from the Rice Industry Office in the northern city, and over one hundred staff members and "hu si" from various rice merchants. Chairman Gu Xinyi first reported on the calibration of the spring measures. The matter concerns the unification of the new system throughout the city, with the spirit of mutual supervision to eliminate malpractices, ensure fairness and honesty in business, and seek credibility in society.</p>
<p>Calibration Situation: The measures sent by various rice merchants in the northern and southern cities for calibration totaled over 1,600. During the calibration, the measures preserved by the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Municipal "hu" of the Weights and Measures Verification Office were used as standards. The "hu si" used small black beans (due to their lack of expansibility) to calibrate each measure one by one. If the black beans overflowed (too much) or were too shallow (too little) after the measure was filled, the amount of excess or deficiency in "sheng" and "he" was estimated, and the wooden block at the bottom of the measure was removed (if too much) or added (if too little). (The wooden blocks were divided into three types: "Fu" for one "sheng," "Lu" for five "he," and "Shou" for two "he.") The method was very careful. The calibration was completed at 3:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Statistics on China's Exports to the US in January</h3>
<p>The Greater America Evening News reports that, according to statistics released by the US Consul General's Office in Shanghai, the total value of goods exported from all of China, including Hong Kong, to the United States in January of this year was US$5,220,932. Non-edible animals and animal products accounted for the largest share, totaling US$2,618,626, accounting for more than 50% of the total export value for the month.

<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Jiaoji Railway</p>
<h3>Extension of the Implementation of Combined Water and Land Transportation</h3>
<p>Due to the Fact that Sun Zhenwu and Tan Shugui Have Not Yet Returned to Qingdao</p>
<p>After the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company signed a detailed contract with the Jiaoji Railway for the implementation of combined water and land transportation, the combined transportation rates have been determined, and the ships operating between Shanghai and Qingdao have also been assigned. All preparations for the implementation have been completed. The implementation was originally scheduled to begin today. Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, also telegraphed Shantou to notify Sun Zhenwu, Manager of the Qingdao Branch, to return to Qingdao as soon as possible to preside over the combined transportation affairs. However, Sun Zhenwu is unable to return to Qingdao due to official business in Shantou. At the same time, Tan Shugui, Deputy Director of the Jiaoji Railway Affairs Office, has not returned from Hankou where he is investigating combined transportation affairs. Therefore, the implementation of combined transportation has been postponed. The implementation will be carried out after Sun and Tan return to Qingdao, as Sun and Tan are the personnel mainly responsible for the combined transportation.</p>
<p>After the Zhaoxing Steamer Abandoned Salvage Operations</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Tenders for Removal</h3>
<p>The Goods Have Been Retrieved by the Insurance Company</p>
<p>After the Zhaoxing Steamer Company's Zhaoxing Steamer was sunk in the Huangpu River by the Sanbei Steamer Company's Wanxiang Steamer, the Zhaoxing Company and the insurance companies that had obtained marine insurance have decided to abandon the salvage. The Jianghai Customs has tendered for the removal of the sunken ship. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Abandoned Salvage</h3>
<p>The Zhao Tai, Lian Bao, Lian Tai, Sincere, Hua An, Ning Shao, and other insurance companies that underwrote the marine insurance for the Zhaoxing Steamer, as well as the Zhaoxing Steamer Company, had telegraphed the Japanese salvage company to carry out the salvage. However, the salvage costs were too high, and salvage was actually quite difficult. Even if it were salvaged, the repair costs would be enormous. Moreover, the insurance was only 70,000 yuan, so it was not cost-effective. A decision was made today to abandon the salvage. As for the goods on board, the Union and other insurance companies that underwrote the marine insurance for the goods carried out the salvage. The goods have now been retrieved, but due to water damage, they will be auctioned off to compensate for the loss.</p>
<h3>Customs Removal</h3>
<p>After the Jianghai Customs Tax Office learned that the insurance companies and the Zhaoxing Steamer Company had abandoned the salvage, it issued a special announcement to tender for the removal of the sunken Zhaoxing ship. The Zhaoxing Steamer sank in the seventh section of this port and now needs to be tendered for complete removal. This tender should be submitted to the Port Director of this Customs House. The deadline for receiving the tender is noon on March 31st of this year. However, the Customs House does not limit itself to accepting the lowest or any tender price. For detailed information, please inquire at the Port Affairs Department of this Customs House. This is hereby announced. Tax Commissioner Boerlad of the Jianghai Customs, March 13, 1934, Republic of China.</p>

<p>Sixteen Puli</p>
<h3>Refrigerated Cargo Ships Robbed</h3>
<p>The Refrigerated Cargo Association Has Asked the Police Bureau to Investigate</p>
<p>The Sixteen Puli Refrigerated Cargo Wharf is guarded by several patrolmen hired by the Refrigerated Fish Industry Association, who take turns patrolling to provide protection. On the evening of the 12th, while the patrolmen were on duty, they saw three small boats coming towards them in the Huangpu River. They immediately shouted to ask what was happening. Unexpectedly, more than ten people in long robes jumped out of the boats and immediately drew their hidden pistols and box cannons, aiming them at the patrolmen and shouting to stop them from making noise. They then entered various refrigerated cargo ships and carried out robberies. At the time, the patrolmen, lacking the ability to defend themselves, had no choice but to let them do what they wanted. As a result, the losses of the various ships were over a thousand yuan. The matter was reported to the Refrigerated Cargo Association, which submitted a report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team Leader Zhu to request that more patrolmen be dispatched to thoroughly investigate.</p>

<p>China Red Cross Society</p>
<h3>Emergency Relief for the Zhabei Fire Concluded</h3>
<p>The victims of the recent Zhabei fire were mostly coolies from Jiangbei. Wen Lan Ting, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society, and Wang Pei Yuan, Director-General, and others, gathered to discuss and provide relief, as previously reported. Yesterday morning, staff members Li Nai Shuang, Wu Yu Lin, Zhang Yi Kun, and Huang Shou Kang, together with Inspector Li Qing Jie and Patrol Chief Yang from the Taiyang Temple Police Station in the Fourth District, went to the secondary fire-stricken area to distribute rice coupons according to the register. However, the fire-stricken area was wider than the previous Jingjiang Road area, so more rice coupons were issued than last time, totaling over 5,000 coupons for four liters of rice each. Maintaining order was quite difficult due to the large population. Fortunately, Inspector Li and Patrol Chief Yang directed effectively, so there were no disturbances during the distribution of rice coupons. However, the Hengfeng Sheng Rice Mill on Aierjin Road, which was entrusted by the society to distribute the relief rice, has been quite crowded with people coming to collect rice in recent days.</p>
<p>Work Relief in the Hebei Disaster Area</p>
<h3>Can Be Fully Completed Within the Next Month</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after Kong Xiang Rong, Director of the Work Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, went to the disaster area for inspection, he felt that the disaster area lacked materials such as bricks and burlap bags for blocking water inlets. He immediately telegraphed various parties to order six batches of materials, which were shipped in batches, in order to speed up the project. According to news from the group yesterday, the work relief projects in the disaster area, except for the complete completion of the Shandong and Henan areas, have also completed most of the Hebei area. The project in this area could have been completed earlier, but was delayed due to a lack of materials. It is now learned that a considerable amount of bricks and other materials for blocking breaches in Changyuan, Shitou Zhuang, and other places has been transported to the area. It is estimated that all the required materials can be gathered by the end of this week, and construction can begin simultaneously to block the breaches, so that the project can be fully completed within the next month.</p>
<p>Gansu Provincial Relief Committee</p>
<h3>Cables Thanks for Donations from the Emergency Relief Association</h3>
<p>Requests that the Central Bank Directly Remit to Lanzhou</p>
<p>The Gansu Provincial Relief Committee, due to the vast disaster area in the province and the lack of relief funds, recently received donations from the joint association of charitable organizations in this city. Yesterday, they specially cabled their thanks to the association, saying: "To the Shanghai Charitable Organizations' Joint Association for Raising Emergency Relief Funds for the Yellow River Flood: We have received instructions from the Gansu Provincial Government that your association has raised 1,000 yuan in relief funds for Gansu Province. Please determine the remittance method immediately and inform us by telegraph so that the funds can be remitted to Gansu as soon as possible. We are deeply grateful upon hearing this good news. Last year's floods in Gansu Province affected as many as fifty counties. Although we have made every effort to appeal for relief funds, we have not received a single cent. As winter passed, countless disaster victims died from hunger and cold. Now, as the season for spring warming and sowing arrives, the disaster-stricken areas are requesting seeds. Our association has appealed without response, and we lack the means to provide relief. Our compatriots in the disaster area are sitting and waiting for death. Now, we have received 1,000 yuan in donations, which is truly a boundless blessing. Please transfer the funds through the Central Bank to Lanzhou. The remittance fee, whatever it may be, should be deducted from the donation. We also earnestly request that you widely publicize the disaster situation in Gansu Province. We will see that the benevolent spirit will reach countless lives. We hereby send this cable to express our sincere gratitude and thank you for your great kindness. Respectfully, the Gansu Provincial Relief Committee, note from National Customs."</p>

<p>Dance Girl Yin Qiu Lian</p>
<h3>Sues for Loss of Beauty</h3>
<p>Scars on the Face Caused by Being Beaten by Gao Li Li Are Still Visible</p>
<p>Income Greatly Affected Due to Increased Disdain from Patrons</p>
<p>Yin Qiu Lian, a woman from Fengtian who used to be a dancer at the An Le Palace dance hall on Avenue Edward VII, had a disagreement with her fellow dancer Gao Li Li over a trivial matter. On the afternoon of October 23rd of last year, Yin was suddenly beaten and injured in the face. She then hired a lawyer to sue Gao Li Li for assault in the criminal court of the First Special District Court. As a result, Gao was fined 30 yuan. However, Yin Qiu Lian argued that she was a dancer who relied entirely on her beautiful face to earn income. Since being beaten by Gao,</p>
<h3>Facial Scars</h3>
<p>are still visible and have not yet returned to their original state, greatly affecting her income. All of these losses were caused by Gao Li Li, so she hired lawyer Jiang Zong Pan again to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the Special Court, requesting that Gao Li Li be ordered to compensate for the loss of beauty and medical expenses, totaling 3,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu Chang Zi presided over the hearing in the Eleventh Civil Court. The defendant, Gao Li Li, did not appear and entrusted lawyer Chao Kun to appear on her behalf. Yin Qiu Lian's statement was then presented, stating that she could not speak Chinese and wanted to</p>
<h3>Testify in English</h3>
<p>At this time, the defendant's representative lawyer, Chao Kun, stated that the plaintiff could actually speak very fluent Mandarin. In order to clarify the facts of the case, the judge ordered translator Mr. Pan to act as an interpreter. According to Yin, she was 22 years old, from Shenyang, and lived at 116 Bazilu. On October 5th of last year, she came to Shanghai from Qingdao. Three days later, she went to the An Le Palace dance hall on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession alone to see the manager, surnamed Jin. At that time, the defendant Gao Li Li was at the hall. Because of Gao's persuasion, she worked as a dancer at the hall. The dance fees were split equally between her and the dance hall. If she received any</p>
<h3>Extra Tips</h3>
<p>from patrons, she kept them all to herself. I worked as a dancer at the hall for only two weeks, earning a net income of five or ten yuan per day. Since being beaten by Gao on October 23rd of last year, I did not enter the dance hall for more than two months. Until two days before the end of last year, I worked as a dancer at the Great China Dance Hall for two days. At that time, many patrons, seeing the scars on my face, suspected that I had irregular behavior and had quarreled with guests, causing them to ridicule me, which made me feel embarrassed. Therefore, I have since</p>
<h3>Refrained from Going</h3>
<p>Judge Yu asked: "During the two months that you were injured, did you work as a dancer at other dance halls?" Yin replied, "No." He also asked if she had attended any large banquets. She replied, "On Christmas last year, I went to the Raffee Garden to dance once with several Chinese people." He asked, "How do you calculate the 3,000 yuan that you now want Gao Li Li to compensate you?" She replied, "Because I have not been doing business for two months, I still have to provide my own food. If the fight had not happened, I could have gone to other dance halls to work, and the income cannot be calculated. Generally, dancers mostly rely on</p>
<h3>Beautiful Appearance</h3>
<p>as a prerequisite, but the scars on my face are still visible. I don't know when they will recover. Although I am currently dancing at the Vienna Dance Hall, when the electric lights are on at night, my disfigured face and scars are quite obvious, causing me to be disliked by patrons and unwelcome. My livelihood is bleak, and I deeply hate it. I am currently receiving treatment from Dr. Wang, a facial specialist on Nanjing Road, who is injecting medicine. He said that it will take two months for the scars to fade. The losses I have suffered include 200 yuan in hospital and medical expenses, and 1,800 yuan in lost income of 30 yuan per day for two months. The remaining 1,000 yuan is for compensation for</p>
<h3>Loss of Beauty</h3>
<p>etc." After verifying the statement, the court advised them to reconcile and avoid litigation, and asked them to make concessions to each other. Yin Qiu Lian then stated that she must be compensated at least 1,000 yuan. At this time, the defendant's lawyer immediately stated that the plaintiff had previously agreed that she only needed to set up two tables and prepare two banquets of wine, each costing twelve yuan, as a reconciliation feast to resolve all previous grievances, and would not discuss anything else. Now that the court is</p>
<h3>Kindly Reconciling</h3>
<p>my lawyer is willing to state on behalf of the defendant that she will bear the costs of this lawsuit. Later, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that Wang, a representative of Gao Li Li, had previously gone to her office and stated that he was willing to offer 500 yuan as a settlement condition. At that time, because the plaintiff owed 500 yuan and was still suffering losses, she did not allow it. Now, she requests that the defendant be ordered to appear in court so that they can reconcile in person, etc. Judge Yu then ordered that the case be adjourned to attempt an out-of-court settlement. If the settlement fails, evidence will be investigated and tried again.</p>
<p>Son-in-law of He Xiang Ning</p>
<h3>Li Mo Nong Transferred to the Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>Admitted That He Is Indeed a Communist Party Member</p>
<p>But Still Unwilling to Confess and Repent</p>
<p>Li Mo Nong, the son-in-law of Central Committee member He Xiang Ning, a native of Guangdong, and Wang Wei Min, a native of Tianjin, were arrested at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Jing'an Temple Road at 9 AM on the first of this month on suspicion of being Communist Party members. They were immediately escorted by the Chengdu Road Police Department to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After three interrogations, Central Committee members Wu Zhihui, Liu Yazi, and others jointly posted bail, and they were transferred to the Public Security Bureau on the day before yesterday (the 13th). It is now learned that they have been transferred to the Garrison Headquarters. All the details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Three Interrogations</h3>
<p>The first two interrogations were conducted by Judge Jiang Shu Zi on the 2nd of this month, and the third was conducted by Criminal Court President Yu Hua on the 6th of this month. For the benefit of the defendant, it was ordered that the hearing be postponed for one week to allow the defendant to present rebuttal evidence. On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 13th), the hearing was held again, still presided over by Court President Yu Hua, along with the judge and prosecutor, in the first criminal court. Legal advisors and inspectors from the Public Security Bureau were present, and lawyer Wu Kai Sheng represented the defendants. Central Committee members Wu Zhihui, Liu Yazi, Zhu Shao Ping, relatives of He Xiang Ning, and others were also present to observe the hearing.</p>
<h3>Transferred to the Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>After the court session began, Court President Yu immediately inquired about the evidence from Hong Kong. Defendant's lawyer Wu Kai Sheng replied that Hong Kong was far away and the evidence favorable to the defendant could not be presented at that time. He requested another two-week postponement and permission to release the defendant on bail so that the defendant could have an opportunity for self-reflection. Subsequently, an inspector from the Public Security Bureau stated that Zhao Lin (formerly Meng Yong Xiang), who recently surrendered to the Public Security Bureau, confessed that Li Mo Nong was a Communist Party member and the current Propaganda Minister of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee, and could testify in court. Later, the police lawyer stated that the defendant had already been given the opportunity to present evidence during the second postponement, so he did not object to the transfer to the Public Security Bureau. Finally, at around 11 AM, the court transferred Li Mo Nong to the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Wu and Liu Did Their Best</h3>
<p>Central Committee members Wu Zhihui and Liu Yazi, along with Zhu Shao Ping and Wu Kai Sheng, immediately followed and paid a visit to Director Wen, willing to jointly guarantee his release. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound Society visited Peng, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, about this matter. He said that the Public Security Bureau has always handled Communist Party cases fairly according to the law. If the offender can realize his mistakes, the state is also very willing to give him a chance to reform. Therefore, Wu, Liu, and Director Wen discussed a solution at that time, which was for Li Mo Nong to first write a letter of repentance. However, Li initially denied being a Communist Party member, so Wu and others left at 7 PM.</p>
<h3>Transferred to the Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>Afterwards, the Public Security Bureau presented many relevant documents, all of which were extremely solid. After reading them, Li had to draft a confession, admitting that he was a Communist Party member. However, he still did not agree to the part about confessing and repenting. At this time, in order to make a fair judgment on legal grounds, the Public Security Bureau transferred Li Mo Nong to the Municipal Garrison Headquarters the night before last to await interrogation.</p>
<p>Hongchang Printing House</p>
<h3>Forging Little Champagne Tickets</h3>
<p>The Plot to Sell and Defraud Was Exposed</p>
<p>Evidence Was Thoroughly Searched and Many People Were Arrested</p>
<p>Recently, someone forged Little Champagne tickets for the Jiangwan draw on April 2nd of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Joint Association and sent people to sell them in teahouses and restaurants throughout the city. However, these forged tickets were printed quite well, making it difficult for buyers to distinguish them from the real ones, and they were easily fooled. The tickets stated that each ticket cost one yuan and that the prize for winning the first horse was 22,400 yuan. Ordinary gambling addicts all rushed to buy them, hoping to win the championship. Therefore, the sales of these forged tickets spread widely. However, the secret was leaked and detected by a detective from the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He also learned that the main printing press for these forged tickets was the Hongchang Printing House at No. 2 Heping Road, Old West Gate. He immediately reported to District Chief Guan Gong and dispatched a large number of detectives to join forces with the police chiefs of the Second District. At about 5 PM on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, they rushed to the Hongchang Printing House to conduct a search. They seized more than 2,000 forged champagne tickets on the spot. However, the manager of the house, Chang Yuan from Changzhou, and his partner had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Wu Weiming, a shareholder of the house, was guarding the door and was immediately arrested. Along with the seized evidence, he was taken back to the district. During the preliminary interrogation by District Chief Guan, Wu Weiming confessed that he was 32 years old, from Lanxi, Zhejiang Province. The forged tickets were brought in by a runner named Lu Quansheng, who entrusted him to print them. Lu currently lived at No. 29 Zhizhongli, Zilaishui Street, French Concession. He did not know anything else, etc. The detectives were then dispatched to the house along with Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession Police Department. Lu was out when they arrived, and his wife, Ms. XX, was at home. The detectives pretended to be partners of the Hongchang Printing House and told Lu's wife that the champagne tickets that Mr. Lu had entrusted them to print had already been printed. When Mr. Lu returned home, he could go to Hongchang to pick them up. The woman believed it to be true. When Lu returned home, his wife told him what had happened, and Lu also believed it without a doubt. When he went to the Hongchang Printing House, the police chiefs dispatched by the Second District were already secretly waiting there. As soon as Lu entered, he was immediately arrested. Liu Zhengquan from Zhenjiang, who came with Lu, was also arrested and taken back to the Second District. After District Chief Guan of the First District learned about it, he sent personnel to take them back together and conduct a preliminary interrogation. Lu confessed that he was 36 years old, from Shanghai. The forged tickets were entrusted to him for printing by Lu Jinshan from Zhenjiang, who lived upstairs at the Dongfang Shoe Store on Caishi Road, French Concession. He hesitated to say anything else. Liu's confession was evasive. Until about 11 AM yesterday morning, the detectives went to Hongchang again for a search. Unexpectedly, the model for printing the forged tickets had been taken out by Dai Rongbao, a partner of Chang Yuan's wife, so it was not found. Dai was arrested and taken to the district for interrogation. His confession was mostly evasive. Considering the importance of the case, it was ordered that they be detained separately for further investigation and arrest of accomplices, and that they be transferred to the General Bureau for strict interrogation and punishment.</p>
<p>Petition from Ferry Workers in Dongjiadu</p>
<h3>Requesting to Run the Ferry Themselves</h3>
<p>Presenting Four Reasons</p>
<p>Requesting to Raise Funds for Improvement</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the ferry workers in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, recently believed that if the Xingye Trust Company took over the ferry, their livelihoods would be cut off in the future, causing widespread panic. They organized a petition group the day before yesterday and petitioned the municipal government and relevant bureaus. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a petition to the municipal government, presenting four reasons and requesting to raise funds to run the ferry themselves to avoid the pain of unemployment. The original text is recorded below: "Presenting this petition because the Dongjiadu ferry is the century-old business of the common people, involving the lives of hundreds of families, men, women, old, and young. It is extremely difficult to allow the Xingye Trust Company to seize it. It should be improved by the common people raising funds to maintain their livelihoods. We respectfully present the reasons and request your kind review and approval. On the ninth of this month, the poor people received a notice from the First Section of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, stating: 'The Xingye Trust Company's letter has been approved, stating that after the company takes over the municipal ferry, it will proceed with the planning according to the established plan. It is now planned to operate the Dongjiadu ferry. The Dongjiadu situation is complex. Please inform the ferry workers to avoid misunderstandings and order them to comply without fail.' The common people were horrified upon hearing this. After returning and discussing it openly, they all agreed that there were four points that had to be clearly stated. The municipal government allowed the Xingye Trust Company to take over the ferry, and the reason it held was that the ferry operated by the common people was too old-fashioned, inconvenient for travelers, and sometimes carried too many passengers, which was dangerous. Regarding the former, during the tenure of Director Huang of the Public Works Bureau, we applied for the issuance of improved ferry regulations and ferry terminal designs to guide the improvement, but it was not approved. The responsibility for the ferry's failure to improve to this day does not lie with the common people. Regarding the latter, it only happens occasionally, and the reasons are all due to passengers who have urgent matters and need to cross the river early and ask for accommodation, and not due to the common people's intention to overload. Even if this is the fault of the common people, it can be rectified, but it cannot be used as a reason to deprive the common people of their livelihoods. As the saying goes, 'To seize the ox because it trespassed on someone else's field, the one who seized the ox is indeed guilty, but to seize the ox is not too much?' The common people occasionally carry too many passengers, and we really don't know why it is considered a crime. But to seize the century-old business and the livelihoods of hundreds of families is too much. This is the first point that must be clearly stated, that the Dongjiadu ferry should be improved by the common people and cannot be operated by the Xingye Trust Company. The principle of municipal operation is the municipal government's standard for city ferries. Whether this regulation is perfect is not up for discussion, but setting this aside, the Xingye Trust Company is a commercial organization whose business purpose is to profit and cannot be regarded as a government agency. It cannot invoke the name of the municipal government's principle of municipal operation for city ferries to seize the century-old business and the livelihoods of hundreds of families of the common people for its own operation. This is the second point that must be clearly stated, that the Dongjiadu ferry should be improved by the common people raising funds and cannot be transferred to the Xingye Trust Company. The central government has issued orders nationwide to adhere to the Three People's Principles and resist foreign economic aggression. Any violation is considered reactionary. The Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three People's Principles is of utmost importance, and the government administration should always take it into account and should not destroy it in the slightest. Foreign ships operating on the Huangpu River and inland rivers are one of the forms of economic aggression, and we should seek to run our own ships and resist them without any doubt. Since the Xingye Trust Company bears the municipal government's mission of industrial development, it should pay extreme attention to both the Principle of People's Livelihood and foreign economic aggression. However, we have not heard of any plans to compete with foreign shipping lines, but it seeks to seize the century-old business and the livelihoods of hundreds of families of the common people. Does this not contradict the central government's policy of promoting the Principle of People's Livelihood and preventing foreign economic aggression? This is the third point that must be clearly stated, that the Dongjiadu ferry should be improved by the common people raising funds and cannot be operated by the Xingye Trust Company. The Kuomintang founded the Republic of China, hoping to progress from the Three People's Principles to the Great Harmony, as shown to the nation, has been around for many years. To not claim the credit as one's own is one of the true meanings of the Great Harmony. However, in the 17th year of the Republic of China, Huang Zihe, who had no historical connection with the ferry, requested to take over the ferry, and it was allowed. Now, the Xingye Trust Company requests to take over the ferry, and it is also allowed. However, the common people, who have a century-old history and livelihoods of hundreds of families connected to the ferry, request to improve the ferry, and it has not been allowed to this day. Is it possible for Huang Zihe to achieve the merit of improving the Dongjiadu ferry, is it possible for the Xingye Trust Company to achieve it, but it is not possible for the common people who have a century-old history and livelihoods of hundreds of families connected to the Dongjiadu? There is no such principle in the Three People's Principles. This is the fourth point that must be clearly stated, that the Dongjiadu ferry should be improved by the common people raising funds and cannot be operated by the Xingye Trust Company. In summary, in addition to submitting this petition to the Public Works Bureau, we specially submit this petition to respectfully request that you allow the Xingye Trust Company to use its capital to compete with foreign shipping lines and develop its business. The Dongjiadu ferry business should be improved by the common people raising funds to maintain their livelihoods, so as to conform to the political principles of the Three People's Principles and avoid disputes. We are extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai, regarding the detention of prisoners."</p>
<h3>Burying Feces in the Bedding</h3>
<p>The stench was unbearable.</p>
<p>A prank by Xu Xiaoming and Jiang Youshou.</p>
<p>Deliberately destroying public property should be severely punished.</p>
<p>Xu A'hong from Ningbo, 45 years old, residing at 384 Zhaojia Road, worked as a tea server on the Ninghai steamer. His wife, Zhou, 42 years old, had only one son named Xiaoming, currently 20 years old. He was extremely loved as a child. When he grew up, he was recommended to learn to drive at the Lili Motor Company. Unexpectedly, Xiaoming did not pursue his studies properly and developed a rogue nature, associating only with the lowest elements. His parents repeatedly admonished him, but he did not repent and sometimes even became rebellious, causing his parents to become extremely angry and often want to expel him. However, his mother, loving her son deeply, repeatedly stopped them. A'hong considered himself as having no son and could only sigh. Recently, Xiaoming, along with the rogue Jiang Youshou, set up a gambling stall on the road, luring people to gamble. They were arrested by the Second Precinct of the First District Public Security Bureau and sentenced to a fine of five yuan each. Xu Xiaoming had no money to pay, and his father, A'hong, refused to pay, so he was sentenced to five days of detention in lieu of payment. Jiang Youshou was also sentenced to detention. Unexpectedly, Xu and Jiang not only did not abide by the rules in the detention center, but also sang operas day and night, making noise and disturbing the peace, ignoring the guards' warnings. The other prisoners were also disturbed and wanted to beat them, but were stopped by the guards. However, Xu continued to stubbornly curse and scold. Yesterday was the day Xu's detention period was completed and he was released. According to the rules of the detention center, the released prisoner's body and bedding must be checked to prevent fire hazards or contraband. The guard saw that Xu's bedding was neatly folded (the bedding was issued by the Public Security Bureau) and thought that Xu still had some redeeming qualities. Who knew that when the guard unfolded Xu's bedding, he suddenly smelled an unbearable stench. Unexpectedly, there was a large bag of excrement wrapped inside, causing the sheets to be covered in filth. This was undoubtedly Xu's deliberate prank. The guard reported to Director Liu, who questioned Xu, asking where the excrement came from. Xu Xiaoming claimed that he had an urgent need and had no choice, but it was found that the bag contained half a chamber pot's worth of excrement, which Xu and Jiang had accumulated day by day. There was no doubt that they deliberately destroyed public property. Director Liu, considering that the prisoner was so naughty and that the law could not be evaded, ordered him to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for severe punishment and then sent to the vagrant work-study center for reformation.</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs Notice</p>
<h3>Attention to Ship Capacity</h3>
<p>Issuing freight manifests must not be unrestricted</p>
<p>Otherwise, the right to customs refunds will not be granted</p>
<p>The General Affairs Section of Jianghai Customs issued a special notice yesterday stating that in the future, various shipping companies must not issue cargo manifests for export, re-export, and transit goods without restrictions. It said, "It has been found that various shipping companies often issue the aforementioned cargo manifests without restrictions, without considering the capacity of the ships. As a result, numerous goods are rejected by customs, further increasing the numerous unexpected tasks of customs officers, such as verifying goods and approving procedures. In the future, various shipping companies must pay close attention to the ship's capacity when issuing the aforementioned cargo manifests. If they are issued arbitrarily and are discovered by customs officers, they will not be allowed to enjoy the right to customs refunds. This is to be followed uniformly. This is a special notice."</p>
<h3>Two Groups of Workers Fight</h3>
<p>Using iron bars and wooden sticks as weapons</p>
<p>The ringleaders were arrested and four people were injured</p>
<p>Zhang Shihao from Guangdong previously worked as a craftsman at the Huasheng Electric Fan Factory. Not long after, he was recruited by the Huatong Electric Machinery Factory on Zhoujiazui Road, Aierkao Road, and transferred from Huasheng to Huatong as a foreman. However, a group of workers did not get along with Zhang and often had disputes. Recently, the workers intended to use force against Zhang, but the plan was leaked to Zhang. Therefore, Zhang Shihao also secretly plotted with a group of former workers from the Huasheng factory to deal with the situation. Yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM, when the two factories let out work, about 500 workers from both sides gathered near the factory gate, each thinking of starting a fight. After a disagreement, the workers from both sides immediately used iron bars and wooden sticks to beat each other, creating a loud and chaotic scene. Fortunately, the Huishan Police Station received the news and dispatched a large number of detectives to arrest them. However, when the workers saw the detectives arrive, they scattered like birds and beasts. The ringleader, Zhang Shihao, was arrested on the spot and taken to the police station for interrogation. However, Fei Xingchang, Cai Tianen, and Wang Zirong, three Huatong workers, and Zhou Shirong, a Huasheng worker, all had their heads injured by sticks and fainted on the ground. The police station dispatched a patrol car to send them to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Beihai Road</p>
<h3>Red Pill Den Raided</h3>
<p>Headquarters Located on Caishi Road</p>
<p>Raw Materials, Machines, Etc. Confiscated</p>
<p>Liu Shaokui and Song Bingzheng, Chinese detectives from the Public Concession Narcotics Department, learned that No. 8 Zhishun Lane, Beihai Road, was a red pill trafficking den. Yesterday afternoon at 3:10 PM, they led Chinese detectives Wu Hanzhang and Xie Futang, Bao detectives Zhang Changgui, etc., to search the premises. They arrested Zhang A'da, a local man, and confiscated 142 large packages of red pills, as well as silver dollars, etc. According to Zhang's confession, they learned that the headquarters was located at No. 227 Caishi Street in the French Concession, with shareholders named Ye A'hua and Chen Wanchun (also known as Huanwen). No. 227 Caishi Street was Chen's home. Detectives Liu and Song ordered two detectives to guard the house and, together with French Concession detectives, went to the address to arrest the woman Chen Ding. In a room converted from a drying platform, they confiscated a large number of red pills, as well as raw materials and machines for manufacturing red pills, totaling dozens of items. They were all taken back to the police station. The detectives guarding Beihai Road also arrested Ye A'hua and Chen Wanchun, who arrived at the house one after another. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court's First Criminal Division. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, explained the situation and stated that the police station still needed to investigate the case and requested a postponement. Judge Feng Shide questioned the defendants. Zhang A'da confessed to manufacturing and selling red pills without denying it, while Ye and Chen gave cunning testimonies. Judge Feng then ordered a postponement of one week for further questioning.</p>
<p>First Special Court Procuratorate</p>
<h3>Continued Investigation of the Xu Case Committee Members</h3>
<p>Zhang Yichen, Shu Huizhen, and 13 Others Summoned and Arrived</p>
<p>Thousands Packed the Courtroom, Requiring a Change of Courtrooms</p>
<p>—Audience Cheered and Set Off Firecrackers to Welcome the Defendants After Interrogation—</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Local Court Procuratorate deemed the statement issued by the Xu Case Support Association on January 16 to be offensive to the court and ordered an investigation of all members of the association on suspicion of obstructing official duties. Prosecutor Zhong Qing held the initial hearing on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. Only Huang Xianggu, Jiang Chiping, and Shao Xubai arrived that day. As a result of the interrogation, they were ordered to be released on bail of 300 yuan in cash each pending further review. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Zhong summoned them again. Zhang Yichen, Chen Binghui, Wang Hanliang, Ye Jiaxing, Yu Qingyu, Wang Honghui, Sun Mingqi, Xue Guangqian, Zhang Dafu, Cao Zhigong, Li Ruzhang, Hu Yibo, and the woman Shu Huizhen, etc., 13 in total, arrived at the court together at 2:00 PM. The audience also arrived in droves. In order to maintain order, the court authorities ordered all Chinese and Western judicial police officers stationed at the court</p>
<h3>To be on Duty</h3>
<p>and notified the Huishi Police Station to send a team of armed Chinese and Western detectives to the court to assist. The hearing was originally scheduled to be held in the 14th courtroom, but because the courtroom was too small, it was decided to move it to the third courtroom. The summoned persons and their lawyers, Tang Hao and Yu Hualong, entered the courtroom to wait. The audience also flocked into the courtroom, and within a moment, the courtroom was crowded. Those who arrived later still kept coming, numbering nearly a thousand. Although the courtroom was large, it could not accommodate everyone, and the noise made it difficult to conduct the inquiry. Therefore, Prosecutor Zhong ordered the police officers to move to the second courtroom upstairs. Police posts were densely arranged from the courthouse entrance, along the escalator, to the entrance of the second courtroom to restrict entry and exit. Only the summoned persons, their lawyers, and news reporters with press passes issued by the court were allowed to enter the second courtroom. Otherwise, no one was allowed to cross the line. At 2:30 PM, Prosecutor Zhong and his clerk took their seats and ordered the police officers to summon</p>
<h3>Zhang Yichen et al.</h3>
<p>from the third courtroom downstairs for interrogation. The crowd then realized that the courtroom had been changed and suddenly became agitated. Some applauded, and others shouted that they did not want to change the courtroom. The shouts and applause were mixed together. The summoned persons were unable to break through the crowd to go upstairs. Someone suggested asking lawyer Tang to appeal to the court authorities and request that the hearing still be held in the third courtroom. Later, Tang explained that they could not defy the order. At 3:05 PM, the summoned persons went upstairs to the second courtroom to await questioning. The general audience wanted to take the opportunity to push out, but were strenuously stopped by the detectives and judicial police, resulting in a slight scuffle. Hu Yibo, one of the summoned persons, was injured in the crowd and even coughed up blood, so he could not report to the court for questioning. The audience, being blocked downstairs, retreated to the square at the courthouse entrance, constantly looking up at the windows and shouting various</p>
<h3>Different Slogans</h3>
<p>in unison. The commotion did not subside until the eleven defendants came downstairs at 4:30 PM. The interrogation upstairs began at 3:05 PM. Prosecutor Zhong first clearly explained that the court was maintaining order in the courtroom and therefore restricted the reasons for the hearing. He then summoned Zhang Yichen to ask about his age, address, and occupation. After Zhang answered, he informed him of the reason for the summons, saying that the court believed that the statement issued by the Xu Case Support Association on January 22 contained inappropriate wording and therefore launched an investigation. He then asked him, "Are you a member of the association?" Zhang answered, "Yes." He asked, "When was the association formed?" Zhang answered, "It was established on January 16." He asked, "Did you issue a statement?" Zhang answered, "No." The court then showed him a newspaper containing the statement. After reading it, Zhang said, "This is a statement issued by various Shanghai organizations. The Xu Case Committee was not aware of it." He asked, "Who</p>
<h3>Elected You as a Member?</h3>
<p>Zhang answered, "I was elected by various organizations." He asked, "When was the declaration issued by the Yigong Committee, which was established on January 22? Since you are a member, you should know about it." Zhang answered, "Because it was not issued by the committee, I really don't know." He asked, "How many members are there in the committee?" Zhang answered, "Seventeen." He asked, "What are their names?" Zhang answered, "I can't remember. I only remember Wang Hanliang, Cao Zhigong, and Chen Binghui. I have forgotten the rest." He asked, "Are Ye Jiaxing and Xue Guangqian also members?" Zhang answered, "Yes." He asked, "Are Li Ruzhang and Zhang Dafu also listed as members?" Zhang answered, "I can't remember very clearly." He asked, "What does the circled language in the declaration mean?" Zhang answered, "Since it was not issued by the Xu Case Committee, I don't know its contents." He asked, "What work do you do as a member?" Zhang answered, "I only went to the meeting of various organizations once, and I didn't participate in the meeting that day, so I don't know the results of the meeting." Next, Chen Binghui was summoned and asked about his age, address, and occupation. He asked, "Are you also a member of the committee?" He answered, "I went to participate in the meeting of various organizations that day and was elected as a member. But I</p>
<h3>Left Early</h3>
<p>So I don't know the number of members." He asked, "When was the declaration published?" He answered, "I left early that day, so I don't know about the rest of the matter. Later, although I saw it in the newspaper, I didn't pay much attention to it. And after being elected, I never went to a meeting because I didn't have time." Next, Wang Hanliang was summoned. First, he was asked about his age and address, and then he was asked why he didn't come last time. Wang replied that he couldn't report to the court last time because of something. He asked, "Are you also a member of the association?" Wang answered, "I have never participated, let alone attended a meeting. Zhang Yichen also said just now that I am a member, I am afraid he also saw it in the newspaper." He asked, "Since you deny being a member, why is your name in the newspaper?" Wang answered, "There are three people with the same name as me in Shanghai. If I am really a member, why would I deny it?" The official said, "Denying is human nature, but whether or not it can be denied is another matter." Then he asked, "This prosecutor has investigated and obtained the names of the above-mentioned organizations,去</p>
<h3>Petitioned in Nanjing</h3>
<p>and accused the judge who handled the Ji Xu lawsuit at the Ministry of Justice Administration. Your name is also on the list." Wang replied, "Although I went to Beijing for other matters, I did not go to the Ministry of Justice to accuse anyone." He asked, "Accusing the Ministry of Justice is another matter and has nothing to do with this case, so it will not be investigated. However, your name is on that event, and your name is also on the Xu case committee, which shows that you have a real relationship with the association." Wang replied, "Because I have the same name as someone else, I was once implicated as a communist, so this time it must be another person. You can ask for an investigation." He asked, "Have you seen the declaration?" Wang answered, "I only read the news, I really haven't seen it." Next, Ye Jiaxing was summoned. Ye admitted to being a member of the association and said that there were seventeen members. When asked about the declaration, Ye also said that the Xu case committee was organized by various Shanghai organizations and that the declaration was issued by various organizations. He was a member of the Xu case committee and had not seen it. The court then asked again about the</p>
<h3>Meaning of the Circle</h3>
<p>and still said that since it was issued by others, he did not know. The court then asked about the accusation against the judge at the Ministry of Justice and also had his signature, but Ye generally answered that he did not know. Next, Yu Qingyu was summoned. When asked about his occupation, Yu replied that his occupation was nation, people's rights, and people's livelihood. When asked again, he still answered that his occupation was the Three Principles of the People and admitted to being a member of the committee. The association was established on January 16 at the City Chamber of Commerce, with a total of seventeen members. Regarding the declaration, he also said that it was issued by various organizations, and if there was responsibility, it should be borne jointly by the organizations. Prosecutor Zhong sighed and said, "Organizations are really easy to use, and when a problem arises, they often shirk responsibility to each other." Next, Wang Honghui was summoned. Wang admitted to being elected as a member by various organizations, but he never attended meetings or handled matters. He also said that the declaration was written and issued by various organizations and that he fundamentally</p>
<h3>Was Not Responsible</h3>
<p>The court then asked again about the accusation at the Ministry of Justice, which had been investigated, and he had signed and stamped it. Did he admit it? Wang still answered that he did not know. The court then said to him, "When doing things,</p>
<h3>You must have courage</h3>
<p>You can't do one thing and shirk responsibility. Since you want to shirk responsibility afterwards, why didn't you consider it beforehand?" Next, Zhang Dafu was summoned. He did not deny the name of the committee member, but said that the declaration was issued by various organizations and should be the responsibility of the organizations. Next, Shu Huizhen testified that she attended the meeting of various organizations that day and her task was the rent reduction issue. Someone then proposed to organize the Xu Case Support Association and she was elected as one of the members. Because of her occupation, she never attended meetings and had never seen the declaration. It was not until she was summoned by the police that she learned the reason for the summons. Next, Cao Zhigong testified that when the rent reduction meeting was held on the 16th, he was the chairman. Someone then proposed to change the agenda and he left the meeting. Later, although he was elected as a member of the Xu case committee, he only saw it in the newspaper three days later. He had never seen the draft of the declaration and was definitely not making excuses to shirk responsibility. Finally, Li Ruzhang was questioned. Li confessed that he did not</p>
<h3>Participate in the Meeting</h3>
<p>Later, he received a notice from the association that he had been elected as a member, but he had not taken office. He did not know anything about the declaration and did not go to Nanjing to petition. Since his name was there, it was probably forged by someone else and it was truly unjust. After the interrogation was completed, Prosecutor Zhong reviewed the confessions and ordered Wang Hanliang, Wang Honghui, Ye Jiaxing, Xue Guangqian, and Li Ruzhang, five people, to be responsible. He ordered each of them to pay 300 yuan in cash as bail, and the rest were released pending review. It was already 4:30 PM, and the court's closing time was very close. Tang Hao, the lawyer representing the five people, said that the bail procedures could not be completed in half an hour and requested that he be allowed to temporarily post bail for them until the cash bail was paid today. The court agreed to be flexible, so Wang and the other seven people left at the same time. When they arrived at the courthouse entrance, the audience applauded and set off firecrackers to welcome them. The sound of clapping filled the air. This situation was unprecedented in the court.</p>

<h3>Hot Water Prices Increase Today</h3>
<p>Two Ladles of Water Sold for One Copper Coin</p>
<p>The hot water industry (i.e., tiger stoves) in this city has recently been struggling due to the extremely low value of copper coins and the high cost of coal and water. The industry's guild, in order to maintain the industry, submitted the official water price list to the Social Affairs Bureau for record, which has been approved. It will first be implemented in the Hunan District of Shanghai and then extended to other districts to maintain the status quo. Therefore, starting from March 15 (i.e., today), two ladles of water will be sold for one copper coin. The silver price of water tickets will be the same as the market price, in order to standardize the price. If anyone still violates the regulations, they will be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau by the guild for strict punishment. This has been announced to everyone.</p>
<h3>Girl Crushed to Death by Bedding</h3>
<p>Who Placed the Bedding?</p>
<p>Police Continue Investigation</p>
<p>Xia Yang, a woman from Beiping, and her husband, Xia Xuchang, worked as laundry supervisors in the Gongji Hospital on North Suzhou River Road. They lived upstairs in a guest room at No. 6 Ruifeng Lane, Dongjiaxing Road. They had four children, the youngest of whom was a girl named Shuanglin, who was just four months old. The couple loved her like the apple of their eye. However, two days ago, Sun Mao, the landlady, wanted to increase her income and suspected that the room was in Xia's room. She placed another three-story loft to rent out to others and increase her income. Therefore, at around 8:00 AM, she hired carpenters Zhan Pei, Jiang A'mao, and apprentice Zhou Zengsheng to build the loft. At this time, Xia's beloved daughter, Shuanglin, was lying in bed after being breastfed by her mother. The bed did not have a mosquito net. Xia Yang saw that her daughter was fast asleep and went downstairs to wash clothes. After washing, she went to check on her daughter. When she entered the room, she saw that the floor had been swept by someone and that the clothes and bedding on the bed had been piled up, but her beloved daughter was nowhere to be seen. She hurriedly opened the clothes and bedding and was shocked to see her daughter crushed inside. Her eyes were tightly closed and she could not open her mouth. When she touched her, she was no longer breathing. She was extremely frightened and reported to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Detectives were ordered to investigate and suspected the landlady and the four carpenters. They arrested a thousand people and took them back to the police station for detention. After the police chief questioned them, none of them admitted to pushing the clothes onto the child's body. The child's body was taken to the Filen Road inspection office. Yesterday morning, the police sent Sun Mao and the other four men and women to the First Special District Local Court's Third Criminal Division and requested detention. Judge Xiao briefly questioned the defendants and approved the request. Then, the procuratorate appointed prosecutor Guo Wei and medical examiners Wei and Zhang to examine the body and confirm the cause of death. According to the Western police chief Hui A'bing, the defendants were working in the room at the time and were afraid that sawdust would fall on the bed, so they piled the clothes together. According to the statement of the child's mother, Xia Yang, Guo ordered that the deceased girl, Xia Shuanglin, was crushed to death by the bedding. The body was handed over to her mother, Xia Yang, for burial and ordered the police to continue the investigation to find out the truth. Leprosy sanatorium under construction</p>
<h3>Leprosy Patients in Various Places Urgently Need Relief</h3>
<p>The Leprosy Relief Association of this city believes that leprosy is extremely contagious and that there are more than 2 million patients in the country. The construction of the sanatorium is a matter of urgency. Therefore, it launched a fundraising campaign for the leprosy sanatorium, which ended a few days ago with excellent results. The construction will begin soon. It is reported that leprosy patients in various places are in dire need of this relief, so we are sharing the information below:</p>
<p>Guangdong is building a hospital. According to the Guangdong Overseas Chinese News, the Shantou Eastern District Pacification Conference opened on the 6th and included the proposal by Qiu Guixing, the magistrate of Huilai County, and Qiu Chongyuan, the magistrate of Chaoyang County, to build a large-scale sanatorium to accommodate patients. The conference decided that the conference chairman, all members, and the county magistrates would initiate the organization. The construction cost is estimated at 12,000 silver dollars, and the allocation method will be determined separately according to the grades of the counties.</p>
<p>Hunan Branch. Xinhua, Hunan, has recently seen a widespread increase in leprosy patients.

<h3>Daxin Silk Shop Auctions Inventory</h3>
<p>Preparing to Reorganize as a National Goods Company</p>
<p>The Daxin Silk Shop on Sanma Road, Shilu Road in this city, was founded by Wang Yansong, a well-known figure in Shanghai. Since its opening, it has been praised by the public for its careful selection of goods and low prices. The business is booming. Wang has also spared no effort in promoting national goods. In view of the increasing trade deficit and the increasing pressure on people's livelihoods, he believes that a large-scale national goods sales organization is needed to stem the outflow of wealth and restore economic power. Recently, the Daxin Silk Shop has been expanded and reorganized into the Daxin National Goods Company to collect national goods and local products from all over the country to meet social needs. It is reported that the internal organization has been prepared and is waiting to be renovated and opened on a scheduled date. However, the shop has a large stock of silk goods and feels that it is inconvenient to move them. It has decided to hold a large auction regardless of cost, with a limited time to clear the stock, so that the shop can be handed over. The shop will be closed for four days starting yesterday to sort out all the inventory. It is said that the auction will start on the 18th of this month, and there will be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editors of Shen Bao: I am writing on behalf of my client, Wang Dechang, to request publication of the following matter. My client opened a cloth factory in Tanjiacun, Zhabei, and in addition to renting the house owned by Sun Wenzhong, also known as Sun Genfa, he rented six or seven fen of land to build his own factory building, which he has occupied for fifteen years without incident. On January 30th of this year, Sun Wenzhong's wife, Sun Li, died for unknown reasons. Sun Wenzhong immediately provoked Wang Dechang and reported the matter to the Fourth District Police Station. Wang Dechang, upon hearing the news, voluntarily surrendered and was detained for one week, but was released by the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau after investigation. Wang Dechang was unwilling to accept this and filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the District Court, accusing Sun Wenzhong of false accusation and requesting legal action. A summons was issued to both parties for questioning. After Sun Wenzhong was summoned for questioning, he reported to the Fourth District Police Station again, resulting in another summons and interrogation. Wang Dechang's accusation of false accusation came first, more than a month after the Public Security Bureau determined that he was not involved and released him, and more than forty days after the death of the deceased. The deceased was not examined for injuries before death, and no autopsy was performed after death. Sun Wenzhong also never reported to the court. Wang Dechang built his own house, so how could there be "forcible indecency," obscene insults, or "attempted escape"? On March 14th, your newspaper's third page, twelfth edition, published a news item about the suicide of a young woman, which completely misrepresented the facts and seriously damaged the reputation of my client. I have been retained as legal counsel to protect his rights and interests in accordance with the law. Therefore, I am writing this letter to respectfully request that it be published to provide a correction. Respectfully submitted to the Shen Bao Editorial Department, Attorney Li Shirui, March 14th, 23rd year.</p>

<h3>A Discussion of Reading Methodology (4)</h3>
<p>The editor has discussed the general issues of reading methodology based on the questions raised by Mr. Wang's letter. Now, I will discuss some experiences in reading techniques with Mr. Wang. - Editor</p>
<p>The first priority in reading is, of course, to emphasize methodology. With a methodology, one's thinking will not be scattered, and one can gain systematic knowledge. However, when reading a book, how can one ensure that reading the book is not the same as not reading it? How can one gain inspiration from the book? How can one remember the important content of the book, or a few brilliant sentences of the author, and what one considers to be wrong? Or what method can be used to facilitate future review? This kind of "reading efficiency" method should also be emphasized. We said earlier that when reading casually, after reading a book, the content of the book may be remembered at the time, but this vague impression will be quickly forgotten after a while. Moreover, when reading introductory books such as "Introduction" or "Outline" of a certain subject, the outline and basic principles of this kind of book should be fully memorized in one's heart. It is useless to remember the meaning of a certain principle in a fragmented way, even if it is remembered in great detail. This kind of book should have its important content evenly memorized, but there is no need to memorize any particular part of it. Now, I will provide a few of the most popular reading methods for your reference.</p>
<p>(1) Underlining - While reading, use red and blue pencils to underline the outline or important sentences in the book. The best place to draw lines for those who usually read Western books is the underline, followed by circles, and then the vertical line next to the page. (2) Marginal Notes - Use one or two sentences or a dozen words to write the main idea of a chapter or section simply on the upper end of the book or on the blank space on both sides of the book. This method is called marginal notes.</p>
<p>(3) Notes - This is the most commonly used method by scholars. It is a very efficient method, but it is also a very clumsy method, because taking notes takes a lot of time. However, if this method is used properly, it is not a loss, so it is still beneficial for busy people like us to read. Notes can be divided into three types: (1) Excerpts - The method is to copy down the author's special views and insightful sentences while reading; (2) Postscript - That is, not only excerpts of sentences, but also criticisms and opinions of the author are written on it; (3) Summary - This method is similar in nature to marginal notes, but there are also completely different points. That is, marginal notes are made as you read, while this is done after reading; marginal notes are written on the original book, while this is written in another notebook; marginal notes are extracted according to the original chapters and sections, while this can establish its own outline at will without being constrained by the original form, and can add opinions. These three methods are all useful, but it depends on your level of reading and the reading material. For example, if you are studying social sciences, and if you have basic knowledge and are reading specialized works or certain issues, then you should use the first method, because specialized issues often have one or two introductory chapters, such as a book discussing the purchasing power of currency, which first describes the nature of currency, various explanations about currency, etc. If you have read a good introduction to economics, you will know all of these things, so you don't need to use marginal notes, underlining, and other methods to take out these things. However, you should pay attention to the author's special opinions on currency, and you should copy these places down. If you are reading the works of famous scholars, then the postscript method is more appropriate, because you can not only copy down its famous sayings, but also write down the criticisms of later generations and your own opinions. But if you do not have basic knowledge, or if you do not have any knowledge of a certain subject, and you are just thinking about doing preliminary research, then you cannot use the first two methods. Because when you enter the subject, you must first read a book of the "Introduction" type of the subject, and most of these books are of the nature of textbooks, so what they describe is the most popular theory, which is the general nature of the subject. There are no particularly brilliant chapters and sentences in these books for you to extract, but the important principles or outlines of the subject, you should remember, so using the summary method, or the combination of summary and marginal notes, is better.</p>
<p>In short, taking notes is for the secondary purpose of preparing for future reading, the most important thing is that taking notes allows you to circulate the things described in the book in your brain for a while, so that you can consider what the author said. Therefore, the first method is the least economical among these three methods. We waste a lot of energy on doing this kind of work, so this method is very useful for writers (because it is convenient to cite when writing), but it is not worth the loss for people like us who do not want to be scholars and writers and who read for practical benefits. However, although this method of extraction is clumsy, the benefits are still there, so we can still use it if we slightly modify its method. The reason why this method is clumsy is that it has to be copied sentence by sentence, which is really too time-consuming, but if we do not copy it sentence by sentence, and use simple sentences to summarize the original meaning by ourselves, and at the same time write down the book title, person's name, volume and page number, so as to facilitate future reading, in this way, the time spent is not much, and the benefits are not reduced.</p>
<p>(4) Rereading - Some people like to read a lot of books, but are unwilling to read a good book carefully or read it several times. This is a big problem. Why is this kind of reading wrong? The reason is this: When readers read a book for the first time, they are actually "clueless", thinking that knowledge is "as vast as the sea", and books are "piling up like cows". Indeed, this is true. But he therefore wants to read all kinds of books as much as possible, which is a big problem. There are dozens of introductory books on a subject in the market. Some people think that they should all be read once, but this is actually a big mistake. The content of these books is roughly the same. You only need to choose a more carefully reviewed book and read it several times, and remember the content, which is better than reading all kinds of books indiscriminately. As a result, you will get confused, and you will know nothing about the general nature of the subject. The pros and cons are really incalculable. Therefore, reading good books several times will not only not waste time, but is very economical. Because when you read a book for the first time, the impression must be very shallow. When you read it again, you will definitely discover many places that you neglected last time, and you can also understand the author's opinions more deeply. But this of course refers to authoritative works, or books that should be read carefully. Of course, there is no need to put in this kind of effort for a class of books that are only suitable for browsing. The method of reading is roughly the same, but you should not stick to the rules, and you should try and modify it at any time. Also, the methods described in this article, except for a slight supplement by the editor based on personal experience, are mostly described by Yuhiko Tsurumi's "The Method of Reading". See Thoughts, Landscapes, People, page 121. Published by Beixin.) If you have time, you may wish to read that article.</p>

<h3>Prepare! Our Skills!</h3>
<p>— A Call to Arms</p>
<p>The 10th Far Eastern Games will soon open in the Philippines!</p>
<p>The 2nd World Games are scheduled to open in Berlin in 1936! One is close at hand; the other seems still far away.</p>
<p>For the Far Eastern Games close at hand, our attendance and selection issues are being discussed by the Chinese National Sports Association. For the Summer Olympics far away, the general public does not seem to have paid attention yet.</p>
<p>According to recent telegrams: More than 50 countries have received letters from Germany inviting them to participate in the Summer Olympics to be held in Berlin in 1936. In the invitation letter, the Germanic nation stated its hope that friendly countries around the world would generously agree to participate and send elite athletes to compete in friendly sportsmanship.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Hitler has decided to designate a 285-acre open space in the Spreefelsburg district of western Berlin, with lush forests, as the venue for the Games. Construction is underway for a stadium that can accommodate 100,000 spectators; outside the stadium, an entertainment area that can accommodate 250,000 people will be set up.</p>
<p>The German Sports Association's special meeting has already decided: "Each village and city across the country will hold competitive competitions to select athletes; then, athletes from various regions will gather to compete, carefully select talent, and give them long-term special training. The government will provide full support!"</p>
<p>On the world stage, we have almost never had a role! We haven't even grasped the tail of all the techniques! With the same skills, why can't we compete with others?</p>
<p>In the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, among the 45 countries that participated, India also scored five points. Tiny Switzerland and Uruguay also scored four or five points each. Our "neighbor"—Japan—after all, had face, scoring 153 points to get the sixth place in the entire Games. At that time, our representative was only Liu Changchun. Our score was a big goose egg!</p>
<p>For the 1936 Summer Olympics, are we going to Berlin to touch goose eggs again? Even touching goose eggs requires preparing several qualified skills. Otherwise, we won't even have the chance to touch goose eggs; that would be even more unacceptable.</p>
<p>We must prepare the skills to seize the "throne" in the Far East!</p>
<p>We must prepare the skills to touch "goose eggs" in Berlin in 1936!</p>
<p>We must gradually reveal our role on the world stage; because</p>
<p>We possess the same skills!</p>
<h3>Spring is Here</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Spring is here! When people hear the word "spring," they will feel that it contains various meanings of "beauty," "happiness," "vitality," and "renewal." It is not necessary for the various presentations of "spring breeze and peach plum," "spring river and flower moon," and "spring colors are annoying" to know the power of the "god of spring."</p>
<p>"The cat is calling, the dog is jumping" this is the spring thoughts of animals. "A girl is in spring, a gentleman tempts her" This is the spring mood of young masters and young ladies. "A moment in the spring night is worth a thousand gold," that is the cherishing of spring by those who go to dance halls and play with prostitutes. "Spring colors are annoying and sleepless," this is the injury of spring caused by unrequited love. There are really many patterns and all kinds of happiness that can't be said about "spring." I welcome you to come, and I hope you will stay in the world forever, so that everyone is full of spring breeze, full of spring, and permanently preserve the spring gland, and will not die even when they are old.</p>
<p>People in the past couldn't think it through after all, and easily abandoned this great spring, burying themselves in books that "cannot be eaten when hungry and cannot be worn as clothing." The antique Shao Yaofu even said something like "the plan of a year lies in spring," stubbornly dragging many people into the cold palace, which is really not right. It was the wine-loving Li Bai who thought it through, so he said, "The ancients used candles to travel at night, there is a good reason for it." With this argument, he could "day and night" desperately drink alcohol.</p>
<p>In bustling cities, it is spring all the time. Shanghai, known as the Paris of the East, is of course no exception. Once evening comes, the light of the red lights and the singing of the entertainers can be seen and heard everywhere. Sexually suggestive and half-naked movies, and dance halls of fleshy temptation, are all fully booked. The fragrance of wine, the smell of cigarettes, the breath of women, and the light of foreign money fill the night in Shanghai. Shanghai has become a city where it is spring all the time, and men and women are stumbling and falling in this artificially created spring breeze.</p>
<p>Hey! Spring is here! In Shanghai, some young men and women have come to the parks; some people who break peach blossoms by car have increased on Longhua Road; and some high-priced spring fabrics have been sold in foreign companies. Shanghainese only have these amazing achievements regarding spring.</p>
<h3>Bulletin Board</h3>
<p>— Shi Jihong</p>
<p>The Spring and Autumn Annals has discussed many things; however, regarding schools, I'm afraid it doesn't amount to even a tenth of what has been accumulated since the existence of the Spring and Autumn Annals. Here, I'll add a piece on "bulletin boards" to fill the void!</p>
<p>Putting out a bulletin board is not an easy task, even though it doesn't grandly state who the editor is or who the publisher is. However, if it's not a student with considerable influence in the school, this bulletin board, once pasted on the wall, can be "snowflakes flying" in less than an hour. Even if a glass frame is used, it will be shattered by someone. Otherwise, the school authorities won't approve its establishment. Even if a privately published one is discovered, the bulletin board will be confiscated, and the person will be punished. (Demerits or a grand dressing down also.)</p>
<p>In the literary world, there are mutual attacks. Of course, everyone clashes with their pens. In their respective territories, they don't hesitate to use ample space for personal revenge. In a small way, a bulletin board is no different. For example, the author's school has a certain drama club that was originally scheduled to hold its debut performance on December 24th last year. Hundreds of tickets had already been issued, but due to the relentless attacks of the bulletin board, a fifty-cent ticket is still in the author's pocket today. Alas, the bulletin board. On this small bulletin board, one can obtain many unexpected gains. Although it has no advertisements, subduing younger students for use during general student assemblies, conquering female students so they dare not treat him—the editor—disrespectfully, are all its functions.</p>
<p>As for the manuscripts, of course, there's fundamentally no question. We'll leave aside the discussion of their origins for now. But why does everyone see it as a remedy? Why is the side dish in the dining hall particularly rich? What disputes do the two factions have? As long as he's there, he can settle disputes with a few words. Why are the female students willing to write articles, knit scarves, and make gloves for them unconditionally? The readers are left to ponder.</p>
<p>Five-Colored Poems</p>
<p>— Chen Xiaocui</p>
<h3>Red Mourns Lost Territory</h3>
<p>Beacon smoke and chaotic fire crows fill the desolate border. Banners and flags cover the land, still Chinese. Dreams awaken in Qin towers to the third pole of the sun. Zhao walls' soldiers shift with the night's bugle. Wronged is your rouge, sharing the shame of the well. Annoying is the color, like cherry blossoms. The setting sun is exactly like a hero's blood, smeared on the city wall as evening haze.</p>
<h3>Yellow Worries About Neighboring Bandits</h3>
<p>The setting sun falls on the vast Han sands. The withered grass of the Great Wall is completely barren. Pointlessly boast of the same race with wax color. Ashamed to see the sunflower flattering the sun. After the chaos, heads are all precarious. New labels and names are dignified and grand. Dragon flags and imperial robes are all child's play. What emperor is like Shi Jingtang?</p>
<h3>Green Recalls Past Travels</h3>
<p>Pond grass grows, and frogs croak noisily. Five hundred weeping willows house the jade city. Ten thousand points of misty light weigh heavy on the donkey's back. A river of spring water is as light as duckweed. Watch the light rain from the pavilions on the mountaintop. In the mirror, the clouds and sky flatter the early dawn. Dividing the indigo snail mountain is useless. Leave it for another life to write the wondrous Lotus Sutra.</p>
<h3>Blue Because Green is not a True Color, Rewriting This</h3>
<p>Your robe and my temples resonate with each other. The bamboo courtyard's incense is exceptionally clear. The lake after rain and clearing sky is one color. Wind passes over the field in a thousand layers of waves. Open the wine, and Ruan Ji casts starry eyes. Go to the tomb, and Feng Niang remembers small names. Always remember the willow shade and fragrant grassy land. Artemisia mud dumplings pass Qingming.</p>
<h3>Black Mourns Today</h3>
<p>Scribbled graffiti is always disliked for being faint. Gray hairs are dyed, and the color never thickens. Pulling strings behind the scenes is all close to ink. Giving charcoal in the snow, how can it be red? Fish squirt liquid to escape easily. Evil spirits spew sand and shoot shadows skillfully. Not seeing, not hearing is not easy. Sleeping country ant dreams are still layered.</p>
<h3>White Praises Gandhi</h3>
<p>The bright autumn paulownia washes the sun. Pointlessly compare invincibility to King Qi. Drying salt and washing the sea are a thousand layers of snow. Scattered pastures and ten thousand points of sheep. Empty room ascetic generates wondrous thoughts. Cloth-clad prime minister has radiance. Mangdang's red emperor, dragon and snake fight. The ghost mother cries at night, temples with frost.</p>
<h3>Five Colors</h3>
<p>Only radiance generates brilliance. Dragons soar, and phoenixes gather, filling the distant sky. Watch the first sun from the mountaintop clouds. The setting sun hangs on the building's corner, broken rainbow. Weaving maids sit at looms, cutting strange brocades. Nüwa refines stones to mend the azure dome. Do not be surprised at the dazzling strangeness. The world-cleansing articles are fundamentally different.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Five: Tearful Faces See Off Those Departing Home for Distant Frontier Garrisons, Wind and Sand Thoroughly Blocking the Nighttime Departure to Station in a Lonely City</p>
<p>In the face of wind and sand, the east was already somewhat fish-belly-colored, and a half-circle of earthen fort could be seen in the distance, discovered in a mountain depression. On the earthen fort, there was also a three-story watchtower, standing out in the sky, which made this area of mountaintops with scattered trees have a different flavor. Looking at the castle, it stood quietly between the valleys, and there was no movement to be seen. Everyone's breathing seemed to shorten, staring at the mountain fort, just walking towards it. Arriving at the edge of the castle, they saw that the two doors of the fort were wide open, and a villager leading a camel was coming out from inside. Seeing this large group of soldiers with guns and knives walking up, he panicked, dropped the rope, and turned around to run into the castle. Bao Fang looked at the castle dozens of steps away, and ordered the army to stop, but called Zi Qiang to his side and said to him: Company Commander Zhao, take two brothers into the fort, explain our intentions to the fort leader, and then we will enter. Zhao Zi Qiang agreed, unwilling to take more people. Apart from two accompanying soldiers, he only let Sergeant Wang Qili follow. Entering the fort, there were forty or fifty households inside, all houses made of yellow mud and sorghum stalks, with several short walls of messy stones surrounding the open space, clearly the foundations of houses that had collapsed long ago. The sky had just dawned, and it was a day of wind and sand, and the people in the fort had not yet gotten up. Zi Qiang said to Shi Li: This place is called Ping An Village, I only saw the name on the map. The brigade commander has ordered that this place is very important, the provincial army here does not care, and the enemy is very concerned, we must take over when everyone is caught off guard. It's fine to come, but the battalion commander is afraid of scaring the people, so he wants to give gifts before using force. Running here in such a hurry, where are we going to find the fort leader? Let's just randomly knock on a door, find a commoner and ask. Shi Li stood under a mud wall and heard someone inside the house say: It's still early, I'll sleep a little longer. (336)</p>
<h3>Random Talk</h3>
<h3>Opening Remarks</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>Opening remarks are not found in the classics, "only seeing" these three words is the essence. The list of gods declares "precisely," so write good words in succession. The Journey to the West poem is the true original, not knowing the original intent and interpretation. The Seventeen Histories Romance is written by Sheng An, only because he was banished to Yunnan. The Book of the Four Books can be explained with bark, so humorous and widely circulated. Eternal sorrow comes from Yuan Gong's hand, who will completely continue it in the Qing Dynasty? Liu Ma Zi's single clap of the board rings, Mo Ling's autumn high song enters the spirit's end. Who can sing Double Phoenix Pearls? Who can play Three Smiles Fate? Who sang and played the South Tower Tale? Who adapted Jade Bracelet? Who newly wrote Romance of the West Chamber? Who composed the old White Peony? There's also Cui E privately gifting the Pearl Pagoda, but no Yu Er visiting the Emerald Garden three times. There are three hundred types of ballad ancient texts, singing one will take two or three years. Only opening remarks are easy to sing, nothing more than the Queen Mother and the Eight Immortals. Change the Southern lyrics into ten-character scores, a sealed memorial presented to the nine-layered heavens. Longevity opening remarks are vulgar and unbearable, only using a hundred longevities to celebrate the grand banquet. Happiness opening remarks are truly hilarious, only using a couple's happy reunion. New compilations have seen book music, bidding New Year's greetings on the old lunar New Year. Nine Harmony Advertising has a new method, lingering sounds spread everywhere. The editor is named Zhang Xunzi, a ballad veteran is Zhang Futian. Zhu Yaoxiang originally intended to issue, and there's also the storytelling master Zhou Yuquan. How many people know the figures in the book market, only a brief expression, not complete. Speaking of the opening remarks and singing method, unspeakably wonderful is in tuning the strings. The technique must be practiced for three years, explaining the work measurements of the four strings. Kong Yunting wants to score the Peach Blossom Fan, the Xiao Hu Lei music house must be transmitted first. As long as the pipa is played well, the magical desire reaches the tip of an autumn hair. I am an outsider, knowing that there is a separate sky in the pot. Only because a friend came to entrust, completing twenty articles overnight. Although not understanding the mystery, the gaming article is originally accidental. If vulgarity is called high quality, any wonderful sentence is overturned. Neither is it Immortal by the River, nor Partridge Sky, neither is it Silkworm Washing Brook Sands to seal words, nor does it resemble the tail sound changing to a minor key. Level tones and oblique tones are not the same as poetic sentences, and sound rhymes do not discuss the whole point of it all, as long as the Wu dialect sings round and round. Now the opening remarks are truly exquisite, a burst of pipa plays casually. Specifically speaking of stealing sound and changing breath, completing the song in eight or ten sentences. Not discussing the goodness or badness of the text, only the large dollar is in hand. Elder ballads had many skills, a full pearl ball was sung for three years. Who can match Ma Rufei's humor, Li Jinlou's pipa is wonderful like an immortal. The opening remarks and singing are all later generations, jokes and interjections are good at turning around. The West Chamber's initial opening remarks method, the pattern is newly turned by Lu Dan'an. Wore a Japanese robe and sang it for three whole years, the South Tower Tale only sang for one day. The entire Dream of the Red Chamber is not sung by anyone, the new drama has been performed in the Grand View Garden. I am now studying everything one by one, the first to pay attention to is miscellaneous articles. Adopt news as material, broadcasting intends to re-publicize. International news is transmitted opposite, financial market prices are in front. Domestically produced goods should be promoted, do not use entertainment to win people's joy. Beijing tunes are difficult to hire famous actors, phonograph records mix time. Beijing accent drum has a humorous fun, only the opening remarks put together a few articles. The east is not finished, the west is invited, Silver Star just goes up and then southeast. If it weren't for the car to take you, the pipa would be so busy that the strings would break. This is Shanghai's broadcasting business, it is difficult to say that the opening remarks are successful. It is not that the Wu dialect is inherently soft, you must speak the source of Chinese and foreign phonetics. Ouh, ya, chao, zha is difficult to listen to, do not learn the bird tongue of the southern barbarians. If you want to sing the national sound, people will naturally understand, concentrate on writing the opening remarks. Fortunately, there is not much to do during the New Year, sing the game opening remarks for the New Year. The ancients have words that must be remembered, you and I each spend our own year. You are not half-baked, I do not have such things. Everyone is spending a poor year, poor in not having large dollars. If you have something to say, friends are good, calling people to be deceived is against the heavens. I write the opening remarks originally without understanding, he publishes a special issue and wants capital. Singing and playing the opening remarks is eating, could it be that I can be a god? This is also a past word, who has time to eat dry white rice. Each person sweeps the snow in front of their own door, do not ask the Dragon King for water money. Ballads are mostly written by literati, the wonderful parts of opening remarks cannot be transmitted. Who twisted off people's voices, Yu Ming's Four Dreams record Linchuan? Whose pipa transmitted a different tune, seeing off guests at Xunyang, Bai Letian? Good opening remarks are truly rare, even if I forcefully revived Bai Ye, I would not say everything completely, boldly write the opening remarks.</p>

<h3>Silver Prices and National Products</h3>
<p>— Pan Yinge</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese people have been promoting national products, and it can be said that they are sparing no effort. In good conscience, who wouldn't want to purchase and use national products? However, promotion is promotion, and the market for national products is still limited. Imports of foreign goods are still continuous. Even for Japanese goods alone, imports last year totaled 200 million yuan. What is the reason for this? As I see it, the biggest reason is that foreign goods are cheaper. It is a well-known fact that foreign goods are dumped. To know why the dumping of foreign goods in China can cause the prices of all goods to fall uniformly, there is a clever method in it. This method was first implemented by the British. On September 17, 1931, Britain suspended the redemption of gold pound banknotes. Therefore, the price of the Shanghai tael gradually became cheaper. As a result, British goods such as piece goods and cotton yarn seemed to be uniformly cheaper to the Chinese. As the shilling became cheaper day by day, British goods became cheaper day by day, and sales became more and more developed. The reason why Britain suspended redemption was due to the European financial crisis. (This European crisis triggered the September 18th Incident in the Northeast. If Europe had not had this crisis, there might not have been an incident in the Northeast.) Who knew that this would lead to the discovery of a new life in Eastern trade. Because at this time, Britain's business in China was being greatly encroached upon by Japan. Since the fall in the shilling, a way out has been found unintentionally. Truly, "a blessing in disguise." After Britain gained the benefit of the low shilling, the first to be envious was, of course, our noble neighbor. After the Seiyukai's Inukai Tsuyoshi cabinet came to power, it immediately suspended the redemption of gold yen banknotes. Half of this was due to financial reasons, and half was due to trade relations. Sure enough, since Japan suspended the redemption of gold yen, Japanese goods have been very cheap, even cheaper than British goods. This is an important reason why Japanese goods are imported in large quantities.</p>
<p>Since Britain and Japan have won in the Chinese market, Uncle Sam on the other side of the Pacific has been even more agitated. He feels that his gold dollar is really too expensive. In any case, the war debts cannot be cleared up for a while, and he is suffering losses in the short term, sacrificing his commercial interests in China first. Therefore, since President Roosevelt came to power, he has been singing a complete good show of suspending the redemption of gold dollars. The more the show is sung, the more energetic it becomes, and in the middle, a climax is added of uniting various countries to set a silver agreement to raise the price of silver. Readers, please think about what he is doing by lowering the gold dollar on the one hand and raising silver on the other? This is nothing more than wanting to promote cheap goods in China, which uses silver. Therefore, in the Northeast, our noble neighbor is using force to invade. For two years, the gongs and drums have been noisy, making a mess. However, in the West, a currency war has been raging. The amount of import surplus has opened a new chapter in the history of trade, reaching a huge amount of 700 million yuan. As I see it, 700 million yuan a year, 7 billion yuan in ten years, after ten years, even if China is peaceful, it will perish. In short, China today is completely the lean meat that others are chasing. (No longer fat) The desire to chase is endless, but China's flesh and blood are limited. The silver problem is the national product problem, it is the national life problem, how to deal with it properly is the responsibility of the leaders of all sectors of our country.</p>
<h3>Women Promote Domestic Cloth</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>—Good News for the Women's National Products Year—</p>
<p>The Shanghai Native Cloth Shop in Penglai Market, Xiaoximen, Shanghai, was initiated by leaders such as the Shanghai County Education Bureau and the County Farmers Education Center. Its purpose is to promote genuine domestic native cloth, increase the income of farmers, and is different from those who specialize in profit. The farmers in Shanghai County, in addition to cultivating fields, all take spinning and weaving cloth as a side business. In recent years, luxury has become the fashion, and imported goods flood the market. The number of Chinese people using native cloth has gradually decreased. After the September 18th and January 28th incidents occurred one after another, the money market was extremely tight. The cloth shops in the countryside were unable to turn around, and they lacked funds to go to the countryside to buy native cloth, resulting in the goods that rural women had worked hard to weave day and night being unattended. Since the goods were stranded, they had no money to buy raw materials to spin and weave, and they all waited helplessly for death, with furrowed brows. The county authorities believed that the bankruptcy of the rural economy was not only related to the lives of farmers, but also affected the security of the entire county. Therefore, they made every effort to promote and improve it. In addition to holding native cloth exhibitions to promote it, they also established the China Cloth Clothing Association to encourage people to join the association and practice the declaration of saving the country with cloth clothing. In order to facilitate the improvement of native cloth, they also initiated the Native Cloth Improvement Association with comrades such as Pan Yangyao and Wang Zhixin of the China Textile Industry Society, and established a native cloth factory, and specially contracted weaving households, sent people to guide them, and provided them with raw materials to facilitate their work. Because the area near Penglai Market is full of schools, the uniforms of students have been adopted by the two education directors, Xu Peihuang and Pan Gongzhan, in a circular to use native cloth. Therefore, a store was set up here to promote sales. It is divided into a retail department and a clothing department. All the cloth samples include more than ten kinds, such as Free Wool, Zhongshan Wool, Peace Cloth, Herringbone Wool, Shame Cloth, and Cloud Brocade. The patterns are divided into thread reed, narrow reed, stripes, squares, and dice. The colors are red, white, gray, and blue. Because this year is the Women's National Products Year, Ms. Wang Zhuoqiu, a high-achieving student from the Wuxi Jingzhi Girls' School, was specially hired to promote sales. Ms. Wang once served as a staff member of the Ministry of Communications and the chief of the Certificate Issuance Section of the Wuhu Shipping Administration Bureau. She is known for her communication skills. She specially made a purple native cloth cheongsam, with black and white diagonal stripes around the edges. From a distance, it looks like Qing's foreign style, covered with a cotton wool short coat, black edges and silver buttons. She wears it to various schools to act as a mobile trademark and persuade students to purchase it. The schools that have already ordered it include dozens of schools such as Shanghai Girls' High School, Aiqun, Qingxin, Minli, Huiqun, Wuben, China, Huiling, Xunyu, Meixi, and Honglu. This is also good news for the Women's National Products Year.</p>
<h3>Family and National Products</h3>
<p>— Mu Yin</p>
<p>It's been more than a year since the Chinese people advocated national products. Last year was the National Products Year. Examining the results, even the four necessities of life, food, clothing, housing, and transportation, are still almost entirely foreign goods. I ask you, what kind of country is this? Therefore, if we don't want the country to perish, we must advocate national products and recover our rights!</p>
<p>The National Products Year has already passed, and the Women's National Products Year has just begun. Therefore, the sisters should make some achievements in this year's responsibility of advocating national products! However, men cannot therefore shirk their responsibility and arbitrarily use foreign goods. You must know that advocating national products is the duty of the people. If we work hard, China will be saved! Therefore, advocating national products is the best way to save ourselves and others!</p>
<p>In the Women's National Products Year, the sisters want to make some achievements. First, we should start with the entire family. Therefore, we want to talk about "Family and National Products."</p>
<p>We will not talk about anything else, but only about the ladies and young ladies in the general middle and upper class families in China. They are really a twelve-point authentic volunteer salespersons in clothing. Try to see if China does not have good silks and woolens? The silk crêpe of the American and Asian Silk Weaving Factory and the latest spring style Luo Na silk of 1923, the butterfly cloth and butterfly velvet of the Hongxinliang Weaving Factory, the exquisite woolens produced by the Zhanghua Woolen Textile Company, etc., are all very good clothing materials, but they not only do not want to use them, but they must wear foreign silk, foreign wool, and foreign velvet. As for daily toothpaste, hair growth oil, rouge, face powder, perfume, snow powder, and other things, there are also Chinese goods, and the products are very good, and they are not inferior to foreign goods, but they must buy foreign goods. And so on, all the utensils and furniture seem to be made of foreign raw materials, which are not enough to add to the spectacle. Because of this, foreign goods naturally flood into middle-class families as if it were a common thing. No matter how much you shout "advocate national products," if the women do not first shoulder this responsibility, China will not be able to sell its goods even if it has them. The more they cannot be sold, the more the national products industry will not be able to develop. Because the national products industry cannot develop, there is no power to improve it. In this way, the future of national products will always be hopeless. In short, advocating national products is not the responsibility of a few people. Everyone should do their best and cooperate to be effective. We expect the housewives of every family in China to take on the responsibility of advocating national products with great enthusiasm, and adhere to the principle of not using anything but national products, ten years as one day. In this way, not only can we refuse foreign goods to penetrate into people's daily life, but China may also be saved because of this! Dear sisters! Run to the top of the Women's National Products Year and work hard!</p>
<h3>Shopping at the Market</h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>"Shopping at the market" is a colloquialism. Everyone who lives in the area near North Henan Road in this city and the nearby national products market understands this sentence. It means to take a stroll through the national products market. In Shanghai, where every inch of land is gold, it is not easy to live. Children hide in cages like chickens and have nowhere to spend their time. In summer, they are afraid of being exposed to the sun when they go out; in winter, they are afraid of being blown by the cold wind when they go out. For this reason, mothers generally take their children to play in the national products market, which is called "shopping at the market."</p>
<p>If women can take their children to shop at the market, not only can they solve the problem of children's entertainment, but also have a related relationship with advocating national products. In this Women's National Products Year, I specially present it to the female compatriots.</p>
<p>First, the national products market always welcomes anyone to visit. Then, when you go in to appreciate it, you can unintentionally make you recognize the names and styles of various national products.</p>
<p>Second, take the children to visit often, and buy some daily necessities by the way. You have bought genuine national products, and the children can develop the habit of loving national products. Fourth, shopping at the national products market more often will naturally buy more national products—and buy less foreign goods. Now, just based on the small consumption of our family, we have traded more than ten yuan in the short period of three or two months. If we consider the residents near the market with a thousand families, then the minimum transaction should be 10,000 or 20,000 yuan. This can be said to be advocating national products.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to add a sentence that in addition to the national products market on North Henan Road mentioned here, there are also several national products markets on Nanjing Road, and there are also places that specialize in selling national products in various places. I also ask female compatriots to take the opportunity to visit more often.</p>
<h3>The Manufacture of Bakelite</h3>
<p>— Ma Yipiao</p>
<p>Recently, the buy-one-get-one-free or buy-one-get-two-free bakelite and bakelite jade items in major national products markets of companies on Nanjing Road have really broken the sluggishness of this winter, and the market has been very lively for a while. Their colors are really lovely; especially the jade-like color of bakelite jade is much more elegant than glass! A year ago, bakelite jade was almost not seen, but now, everyone knows it and uses it, but what is their celestial body? There are still many people who don't know; so I'm here to introduce it, I will first talk about bakelite, then talk about bakelite jade.</p>
<p>Bakelite, also known as phenolic plastic, was originally named Bakelite. It was successfully improved by the American Bakeland and has been around for 23 or 24 years. Now all countries can manufacture it, and there are more than a dozen names. Our country's Shengde Company can also manufacture it.</p>
<p>The main raw materials of bakelite are Carbolic acid and Formalin. The manufacturing method is to heat equal amounts of carbolic acid and formalin with an alkaline condensation agent (such as Ammonia) for several hours, which will separate into two layers, the upper layer is water, and the lower layer is the initial condensate of bakelite. The condensate is liquid or solid, soluble in alcohol or acetone (Acetone), brittle, and melts when heated, just like rosin. If it is heated again, it becomes a hard solid that no longer dissolves in solvents. However, if the solid is placed in a mold and heated and pressed appropriately, it can be pressed into products, and the solid will eventually become an irreversible substance that no longer dissolves and no longer melts. It can resist ordinary acids and bases, and can withstand heat up to 300 degrees Celsius. Especially, the fact that it does not conduct electricity at all is its characteristic, so it can be said to be the most suitable material for electrical materials.</p>
<p>The bakelite raw material used for bakelite products is mixed with pigments and sawdust or asbestos before the condensate becomes solid, and then crushed into powder after it is condensed, commonly known as Bakelite Moulding Powaer.</p>
<p>The bakelite powder is placed in a steel mold, heated to about 160 degrees Celsius, and pressed with a press to obtain the products seen on the market.</p>
<p>The production of bakelite powder is the largest in the United States, with an annual output of 80 million yuan, followed by Germany and England. In the future, the use will be expanded and developed without limit, which can also be regarded as the glorious contribution of synthetic chemistry.</p>
<h3>Two Questions Raised by the Women's Circle</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>How to Satisfy People? How to Easily Distinguish?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that domestic goods should be promoted and used, but the most difficult problem is that it is difficult to distinguish between the genuine and the fake. Mrs. Cai Yuanpei first raised this question at a reception at the Brahma Wangdu Club, saying that consumers clearly want to buy domestic goods, but because they lack the ability to distinguish, they are deceived, which inevitably leads to disappointment. Then, Ms. Wang Xiaoying, representing the women's circle, raised two points: First, how to make the products satisfactory? Second, how to prevent domestic goods from being confused with non-domestic goods? Finally, Mrs. Pan Gongzhan, Ms. Lin Kecong, also made sincere statements on several points such as improving domestic goods, distinguishing domestic goods, and recognizing domestic goods. The next day at the Lake Society meeting, Mr. Cai Jie Min and Mr. Huang Renzhi also expressed these opinions, so I will come here to explain it, perhaps to answer the opinions raised by everyone:</p>
<p>It is difficult to run a business, and it is even more difficult to run a domestic goods business. The leaders of general factories work hard to improve their products every day, but they still cannot satisfy many people. This is certainly related to technology and economy, but the psychological effect is also very important. To be fair, if you go to a domestic goods company to take a look, Chinese domestic goods, not to mention the rapid progress, even the increase in variety is amazing and admirable. If those who buy domestic goods study carefully, most domestic goods can replace foreign goods and even surpass them. Even if the price is more expensive and the color is worse, it is very gratifying that a nascent industrial country can do this. If you have a strong spirit of sacrifice and determination, and trust the domestic goods company, you can use it as much as possible without doubt.</p>
<p>Speaking of distinguishing, it is certainly necessary to rely on the consumer's own eyesight, but this responsibility should be borne by the domestic goods company to first review the products. If there is any doubt, in any case, they should not sell it for him. Since consumers have completely entrusted the distinguishing procedure to the domestic goods company, then how cautious and strict the domestic goods company should be to fulfill its national duty. General customers can also rest assured. At the same time, I hope that the National Government will quickly implement the regulations on the marking of domestic goods as scheduled, and no longer hesitate. And the general traders who steal the sky and change the day should also take out their conscience, repent and change their minds, and no longer do things that confuse the fake with the genuine to deceive and harm people. A quarter of the Women's Domestic Goods Year has passed, how hard should everyone work!</p>
<h3>Believe It or Not</h3>
<p>— Xi Yin</p>
<p>If any high-ranking official can personally know how to wear local goods, then those below will surely follow suit! Let's look at the past: The Qin Dynasty was extravagant and the Han Dynasty was simple. The Han Dynasty was well governed, and there were many elders' behaviors. The Sui Dynasty was extravagant and the Tang Dynasty was simple. The Tang Dynasty was well governed, and brocade embroidery was useless. I think if the current National Government officials also become simple like the Han and Tang Dynasties, and their governance is good, then foreign goods will be useless.</p>
<p>Not to mention high-ranking officials, even if someone with a little reputation rises up and does it, those below will surely follow suit. A Chu person flaunted his clothes, and someone wore extra-thick clothes and liked black cloth. The villagers all followed suit, silk did not enter the border, and the dyeing workers moved far away. I think if the current county magistrate or provincial chairman also likes domestic cloth like the Taipu, then at least the people in one county or one province will follow suit, and foreign goods will not enter the border and move far away.</p>
<p>Not to mention people with a reputation, even if a commoner can rise up and do it, the villagers can also follow suit. Chen Youliang's father liked to wear coarse clothes. When he broke through Qi, he did not kill those who wore coarse clothes. A merchant from Luo was in Qi, and was spared because he wore coarse clothes. He returned and wore coarse clothes for the rest of his life, and the villagers all followed suit, silk did not enter the border, and the dyeing workers moved far away. I think if anyone now wears domestic cloth for the rest of their lives like the merchant from Luo, the villagers may also follow suit, and foreign goods will never enter the border again.</p>
<h3>The Principal's Daughter</h3>
<p>— Han Yu</p>
<p>The New Year holiday is over, and the students who went home have returned to school. On the public notice board, I saw a very strange notice:</p>
<p>"This afternoon at 4:00 p.m., our school will hold a girls' talk. All female students are expected to attend! This notice is from the Principal's Office." At that time, many people speculated that it might be for the New Year's Eve party.</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m., the auditorium was full of girls. They were eager to know the meaning of the talk, and were all looking at the entrance. After a while, they saw the principal's daughter slowly walking to the stage from the entrance, which had already surprised them all. What surprised them even more was that the principal's daughter was not wearing her glamorous clothes today, but a blue cloth cheongsam, and she did not apply any powder on her face.</p>
<p>The principal's daughter was originally the school beauty of that school. Her purpose of studying was only to pass. After passing, she would never study that subject again. What she paid most attention to was decoration. From her head, face, body, to her feet, there was nothing she didn't want to compete with the girls in the whole school. In terms of qualifications and decoration, she almost became the leader of all the female students. The female students in the school tried their best to dress newer and more beautifully than her, but no one could beat her. Today, she is so undecorated, of course, this surprised them all.</p>
<p>The principal's daughter went to the podium and began to speak: "Everyone may be surprised, why has my decoration changed like this today? In fact, I can tell you all, this is my new life! Today I can tell you all the process of my new life: On New Year's Day, I went to participate in the Women's Friendship Conference. The purpose of my participation was actually meaningless. But at that conference, I was greatly moved. Therefore, I got a new life. What is my new life? It is to use domestic goods! My purpose of using domestic goods is to save China! We use foreign goods for the sake of beauty. But how can the price of beauty compare to patriotism? Can't we use the same domestic goods to replace them? Even if domestic goods have shortcomings compared to foreign goods, can't we slightly damage our beauty for the sake of patriotism? Now I have got a new life, I hope everyone will also get the same new life!" Then there was a burst of applause.</p>
<p>The principal's daughter said again: "I have already prepared a list, which can now be distributed to you all. The list lists the names of domestic goods that can replace foreign goods. You can buy excellent domestic goods according to the names on the list. And I hope that from today onwards, we will all switch to domestic goods. For the foreign goods you bought before, you can either discard them, or switch to domestic goods after you use them up. Only in this way can we fulfill the responsibility of women in the Women's Domestic Goods Year. After the principal's daughter announced the end of the meeting, everyone returned to the dormitory. Most of them sealed up the foreign goods and put them in a room, with the words "Memorial of Regret for Using Foreign Goods" written on the outside for the male students to visit. In this way, the male students also gradually switched to domestic goods.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, everyone in the whole school, except for the indispensable foreign goods that cannot be replaced, switched to domestic goods. Everyone said: "Like the principal's daughter, she is qualified to be a leader!"</p>

<h3>Huang Jianzhong Proposes to Improve Higher Education</h3>
<p>Seeking Substantive Improvement</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 14th) Huang Jianzhong, Acting Director of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, told reporters on the 14th that higher education in our country should seek substantive improvement, not an increase in quantity. School equipment should be strengthened and enriched, the level should be improved, and the employment prospects for graduates are particularly important issues. Now it is not easy for university graduates to find other jobs. In the future, they should be directed to social occupations.</p>

<h3>Education Delegation</h3>
<p>—Observations in Nagasaki—</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education previously sent Zhou Hou Shu, Principal of Yangzhong School, Cao Chu, Principal of Zhenshi School, Yan Liyang, Principal of Xuzhong School, Teng Songshi, Principal of Huangdu Normal School, Shen Shanzhi, Principal of the Attached Elementary School of Zhenshi School, Sheng Langxi, Principal of Shangzhong Experimental Elementary School, Zhao Hongqian, Curator of Zhenjiang People's Education Center, and Yu Jiwen, a teacher from Zhenjiang Teachers School, who went with them, to form the Jiangsu Provincial Education Delegation to Japan for inspection by boat on the 28th of last month. They arrived in Nagasaki at 1:00 p.m. on March 1st. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Now, the letter from the delegation is recorded below.</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Arrived in Nagasaki at 1:00 p.m. on March 1st. After landing, they visited two schools, one was the Mitsubishi Private Vocational School, and the other was the Nagasaki Prefectural Women's Normal School. From these two schools, they felt that there were many things that could be learned from them, such as the cleanliness of the entire school layout, the hard work of the students' operations, and the students' bowing to the visitors. The Mitsubishi Vocational School is divided into shipbuilding and machinery departments, and the level is the same as that of middle school. After graduation, they serve in the Mitsubishi Shipyard. Usually, the internship is also in the factory. When students are in the internship, the factory will give them wages. First-year students get 20 cents a day, second-year students get 30 cents, and third-year students get 50 cents. Students in the school wear extremely crude yellow cloth uniforms, and although the weather is very cold, the clothes are very thin. They are barefoot all day long, without shoes and socks. The strength of their physical resistance can be seen. When the teacher enters the classroom at a fixed time, a student shouts "Attention", and the whole body stands up and salutes. Usually, they are very respectful and obedient to the teacher. Physical exercise focuses on martial arts and wrestling. The women's school is prefectural, and its equipment has surpassed our provincial schools. There are 365 students in the whole school, and 250 boarders. All the cleaning matters of the whole school are handled by the students in rotation. They pay great attention to household affairs and etiquette training. In terms of household affairs, there is a laundry room, and the clothes are washed by the students themselves. The cement laundry pool is well equipped and can be imitated. The cooking practice room is equipped with multiple cement platforms, each equipped with a Western-style gas stove and a Japanese firewood stove. The sewing room is equipped with more than a dozen Singer sewing machines, and there is also a handmade sewing room. In terms of etiquette training, there is an etiquette practice room, decorated with family style, where students practice family etiquette and hold tea parties. There is also a large reception room for students to communicate with each other and learn etiquette. Students bow and salute to the image of Emperor Showa every morning when they enter the school and before meetings. A shrine is enshrined in the dining hall, and they salute before picking up chopsticks. The students' attitude is very leisurely and quiet. Within ten minutes after class, it is also very quiet and orderly, unlike the noisy situation of students in general schools in our country. The students are all very strong and full of energy. From this, we can see the strength of their physique. The school is equipped with classrooms for each subject, such as literature classrooms, history and geography classrooms, science and chemistry classrooms, and nature classrooms. The school's books for each subject are placed in each special classroom. There is no special person to manage them, but the layout is very neat, and there is no fear of loss. In this way, books can be fully utilized. The items sold in the school store are listed outside, and the manager sits inside, only responsible for collecting money and accounting, unlike our country's setting up counters, which is a natural gap between buyers and sellers. The students' spirit of autonomy can be seen from this. The most admirable and most worthy of imitation of its equipment is the local product display room—there are three rooms of the same size as the classrooms, one is the geography display room, one is the history display room, and the other is the nature display room. The items displayed in them are all local products of Nagasaki Province collected by the students themselves. The geography room displays all agricultural and industrial products of this province and charts, books, etc. related to the geography, humanities, and climate of this province. The history room displays portraits of historical figures in this province, hanging pictures of important historical facts, and models, charts, and books of costumes and cultural relics of past dynasties. The nature room displays plant wax leaves collected by students themselves, taxidermy animal specimens, and various mineral specimens, all limited to those owned by this province. Among them, pearls, crystals, tortoiseshells, etc., which are famous products of Nagasaki, are especially beautiful. The items displayed in the three rooms are dazzling and breathtaking, making people sigh. It is not easy for our provincial middle schools to get this. Zhou, the director of the Provincial Department of Education in this province, intends to vigorously promote local education. The intention is very good. In the future, all counties and schools should earnestly imitate it. If not, students will not know the loveliness of their hometown. Those who do not love their hometown do not even know where to start loving their country. Moreover, this can make them know all the raw materials and production in this province, which can inspire their interest in engaging in production. Moreover, everything is collected, produced, and arranged by the students, which is especially meaningful.</p>
<p>When visiting, the most shocking thing is that in the reading room of the women's normal school students, there is a large, carefully framed character hanging, which reads "Defeat the Enemy Country" in four big characters. Seeing it makes people tremble and their hair stand on end. In addition, the walls of Mitsubishi Public School are hung with portraits of generals after the Russo-Japanese War. Everywhere shows their imperialist ambition of aggression. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial School Funding</p>
<h3>Payment Notice Signed</h3>
<p>Half a Month's Payment Will Be Made Soon</p>
<p>The payment notice for the second half of February and the first half of March for the Jiangsu Provincial Rural Normal Schools and Provincial Elementary Schools (the full month of February for Social Education Institutions and Vocational Schools, and the first half of February for Middle Schools and Normal Schools) has been signed by the Jiangsu Education Fund Auditing Committee. At the same time, the payment notice for the spring study abroad expenses has also been signed and will be sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for stamping soon. It is heard that the payment notice for one month's expenses for each school can be issued for half a month first, because the Jiangsu Education Treasury currently has 210,000 yuan. After deducting 100,000 yuan due on March 20 to repay the Jiangsu branches of the Bank of Communications, the remaining 110,000 yuan still needs to be raised by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan to be enough to pay half a month's expenses for the provincial schools. It is also heard that the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office has a solution for the shortage of several thousand yuan in collecting education fees from various counties. Each school will soon be able to receive half a month's expenses.</p>

<p>This City Will Review All Middle Schools</p>
<h3>Qualifications of Deans of Students and Civic Education Teachers</h3>
<p>The Review Committee Will Hold Its First Meeting Today</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education changed the Party Principles course in various schools to Civics, the central government believes that the content of the Civics course is related to the principles of our party, and the nature is still important. Therefore, it immediately ordered the Party Departments and Education Bureaus of various provinces and cities to end the previous committee for reviewing Party Principles teachers and establish a committee for reviewing the qualifications of deans of students and civics teachers to engage in qualification review to be careful about teachers. After the Party and government authorities in this city were issued the regulations, they immediately appointed Zhu Jiarang, Chen Bai, Zhu Yakui, Yu Zhongbiao, Jiang Wenbao, and five others as committee members. They also formed a committee with two ex officio members, Tong Hangbai and Pan Gongzhan, to be responsible for this matter, and decided to convene the first meeting today for progress. It is heard that this review of deans of students and civics teachers is limited to middle schools. Elementary school teachers do not need to apply. If there is no dean of students in a middle school, then the director of teaching in charge of moral education should also apply for review. Now, the regulations for the two subjects are transcribed below.</p>

<p>International Basketball</p>
<h3>The United States Wins the Men's Championship</h3>
<p>China Suffers a Miserable Defeat by One Point, 38 to 37, Yesterday</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Team is Promising, Winning Again Against the Federation</p>
<p>The Previous Champion, Great Britain, Was Defeated by the United States Yesterday</p>
<p>The men's championship of the 9th Shanghai International Basketball Tournament has fallen into the hands of the United States. In the second final last night, China unfortunately suffered a miserable defeat by a difference of only one point. The score was 38 to 37. The atmosphere was extremely tense in the last five minutes. The Chinese women's team, however, has endless hope for the women's championship, winning again with a score of 34 to 32. The British team, which was considered the most promising, was defeated by the United States last night, 29 to 22. If China loses to Great Britain again on Saturday night, they will win this year's championship. Otherwise, China, Britain, and the United States will form a three-way standoff. The battle situation last night is briefly described as follows:</p>
<h3>China Defeats the Federation Again (Women)</h3>
<p>—Thirty-Four to Thirty-Two—</p>
<p>Although the Federation is composed of troops from many countries, it is not an opponent of China. It lagged behind China all the way and never managed to raise its head. In the last quarter, due to a small change in the Chinese lineup, the Federation took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, catching up with nine points from 34 to 23. As a result, the Chinese women's team only won by 34 to 32. Pan Meng opened the scoring at the start, and the Federation's center Clark also scored two points. But China scored three consecutive goals, taking the lead 9 to 3 in the first quarter. China's momentum was unstoppable, and they scored another six points, making the score 15 to 3. As a result of the first half, China won 21 to 12. Starting from the second half, the situation remained the same, 24 to 14, 28 to 18. The third quarter was 22 to 20. Unexpectedly, in the last quarter, taking advantage of the Chinese team's adjustment, the Federation launched a fierce attack, scoring nine consecutive points, almost being caught up. The result was 34 to 32.</p>

<p>Federation　 (1) Three points　 (2) Nine points　 (3) Eight points　 (4) Twelve</p>
<h3>Great Britain Loses to the United States (Women)</h3>
<p>—Twenty-Nine to Twenty-Two—</p>
<p>The battle between Britain and the United States was very intense and dramatic, and it was difficult to distinguish the winner until the very last quarter. Both of the British defenders, Hilden and Ke Lai, were sent off, and the United States was able to take the offensive, scoring seven consecutive points, to win with a score of 29 to 22. In the first quarter, Great Britain took the lead by one point with a score of 6 to 5. Then it was 9 to 9, 11 to 11, with the difference being one ball two or three times. The United States, with its wonderful coordination, won the first half by six points with a score of 17 to 11. In the second half, Great Britain's counterattack was fierce and very successful. They chased the score to 19 to 19 and then took the lead by two points with a score of 22 to 20. Unexpectedly, in the last quarter, both of the British defenders were sent off, so they could not hold on. The United States scored nine consecutive points to win with a score of 29 to 22.</p>

<h3>The United States Defeats China Again (Men)</h3>
<p>—Thirty-Eight to Thirty-Seven—</p>
<p>The Chinese men's team lost again by a difference of one point in the second final last night, 38 to 37. It was a pity. Otherwise, the outcome of the third final would have been difficult to predict. The United States first fought with sea bandits and only added the defender of Beshep, with a fierce momentum, making the score 10 to 2. China sighed that it was difficult to deal with. Lu Zhongen made a free throw, and the situation was difficult to see. Hu Zhengqu was transferred out, and Feng Nianhua entered again. As a result of the chase, the score became 15 to 10, which was a little closer. The United States won the first half by four points, 17 to 13. In the second half, the United States changed to Mailing to fight, and the center remained unchanged. When the score was 19 to 15, Lu Zhongen passed the ball to Feng under the basket, and Feng actually dropped a ball that could have been scored, and instead made a free throw, with a difference of only three points. The accurate long shots of Kaideng and Mao Lai made the Chinese athletes very棘手. The score difference was always around ten points. When the score was 36 to 28, Feng Nianhua scored two consecutive goals, and Lu Zhongen made a free throw, with a difference of only three points. The American team was extremely flustered, and the Chinese also lost the opportunity to score four or five times due to the tension of the situation. Otherwise, they would have turned the defeat into victory. With the score at 37 to 35, Qian Jingyong was sent off. Although China scored another goal, the game ended in a blink of an eye, and they lost with a score of 38 to 37, which was a great pity.</p>

<p>Dong Hua Scores Seven to One</p>
<h3>Yesterday Soundly Defeated the British Navy</h3>
<p>The Navy Collapsed in the Last Ten Minutes</p>
<p>A Scene from the Western League A Group Football Match</p>
<p>Dong Hua played against the British Navy at the Chinese baseball field yesterday and soundly defeated them, with a score of seven to one. This was a scene from the Western League A Group football match. The score was two to one in the first half. The Navy stubbornly resisted until the last ten minutes, when they were defeated beyond repair. Their goalkeeper's performance was unique. There were only a few hundred spectators.</p>
<p>The Navy Opens the Scoring First The Navy kicked off, and its momentum was not weak. The Dong Hua lineup was greatly burdened. Dong Hua's counterattack was ruined by inaccurate shots. After fifteen minutes, the Navy came to harass again, directly approaching the goal. Fortunately, a corner kick was saved. Davis opened it, and the landing point was accurate. Without any intention, Hale and Hantesheng rushed in, and by the time the goalkeeper knew, the ball had already rushed in.</p>
<p>Dong Hua Launches a Major Counterattack After losing first, Dong Hua launched a full-scale counterattack, ordering the siege of the Navy goal. The ball was like a cannonball, and despite the Navy goalkeeper's experience and the lack of shooting preparation, they were unable to score. At this time, the ball was in the middle zone. Dai saw that there was room for maneuver and was far to the right, so he could make a sneak attack. So he passed the ball to the right, and Yu Tian flew to hit the left corner diagonally, and happened to enter the goal, making the score 1 to 1. Fifteen minutes later, Wan Xianghua shot directly at the goal from the left corner. The ball bounced off the crossbar, and Li Rong'an kicked it in, making the score 2 to 1 in the first half.</p>
<p>The Last Thirty Minutes Starting in the second half, Dong Hua continued to use the encirclement strategy, going back and forth in front of the goal. Zhou Guangzhong was frustrated by repeatedly failing to score, and became very brave, scoring two consecutive goals, making the score 4 to 1. At this point, there were only ten minutes left in the game. The Navy defended desperately and did not come out again. Dong Hua attacked fiercely and did not rest. Wan Xianghua passed the ball in, and Dai Linjing got it with one strike, 5 to 1. Chen Yu Tian picked the ball over the goalkeeper and happened to fall into the goal, 6 to 1. Li Rong'an added another goal, 7 to 1. In these last ten minutes, the Navy collapsed beyond repair, which was also unexpected.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Peach Blossom River is a Beauty's Nest</h3>
<p>—Wo Ding</p>
<p>"Peach Blossom River is a beauty's nest..." This is a famous song of modern times, sung everywhere. Peach Blossom River is in Yiyang, Hunan. Does it mean that the most beautiful women in China come from there, because of the good scenery? Or is it for other reasons?</p>
<p>The people of Hunan are a very barbaric race, less civilized than Sichuan or Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and naturally combative. But because of their combative nature, most of the revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries everywhere are from Hunan. So, for the creation of this Republic of China, the people of Hunan have contributed a lot of strength.</p>
<p>However, when many modern men and women hum this song lightly, how can they know the great suffering in it? Aren't the people of Hunan fighting outside all year round? "Poor bones lie by the endless river; yet still in her chamber, she dreams of her dear one." These two lines of poetry perfectly describe this current situation. Now, in the Peach Blossom River basin, or, more broadly, in the river basins of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li, most of the men are dead bones, and countless women are still dreaming, hoping that their men will return as officials, or have a chance to live.</p>
<p>Whether war should exist is not a matter for discussion here. But this current situation is worth noting. The people are born like weeds and die like weeds. There is no need to talk about those who have died, because the theory of reincarnation is ultimately just a distant tale, but what about the so-called "survivors"? What methods can be used to eliminate or reduce this great amount of "human suffering"—poverty, helplessness, and misery? Raising them! Teaching them! Building them! Can this reduce even a hair's breadth?</p>
<p>This current situation is the same everywhere, but it is particularly obvious in Hunan. At this time, if there is someone who can "read the atmosphere", he should see black air everywhere, endless poverty, desolation, and grief! But we are happy to sing "Peach Blossom River is a beauty's nest"! ... And it has even been arranged into a Western dance tune! Dancing is actually good, and beauty is also good, but it might be even better if men didn't become "bones by the endless river"! "Transcendence" is also good, and performing Buddhist rituals is also fine, but instead of paying attention to the afterlife of the dead, it would be better to pay a little attention to the lives of the living!</p>
<h3>Wooden Fish</h3>
<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>From the narrow mountain path of Lotus Mountain, winding in, before you even walk a few dozen steps, you can see a towering temple. That is the Lotus Nunnery. Around the courtyard, dense bamboos grow thickly. When the sunlight filters the bamboo shadows onto the walls, it forms a natural pattern. The scenery is quite serene.</p>
<p>The temple only worships Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy; besides her, there are some other deities. However, these deities are all in a "vassal" status. Inside the temple, besides an old nun, Jingxin, there is only a young nun, Huiming. In this desolate Lotus Nunnery, the master and disciple quietly spend their lonely days.</p>
<p>Huiming was sent to the nunnery from a young age. It is said that when Huiming was a child, her parents, greedy for the wealth of the village gentleman, Li, rashly betrothed their daughter to his son. However, less than two years after their engagement, the man died of "consumption." At that time, her husband's family did not make any proposals regarding her future, but her father believed that "a good horse doesn't eat returned grass, a good woman doesn't marry a second husband." It seemed that for a scholarly family like theirs, it would be quite shameful if their daughter could not remain faithful to one man until death, so they forcibly sent her to the nunnery.</p>
<p>For Huiming, when she was young, perhaps she could not bear the silence of the Buddhist temple: the dryness of vegetarian food: the hideous idols may have frightened her, but these were only limited to physical suffering. Spiritually, she was still content.</p>
<p>Later, in the mournful sound of the wooden fish, her age gradually increased. Now, she is a twenty-year-old young woman. Due to physiological changes, she gradually felt spiritual distress. Especially when she returned home to visit her family, seeing the joy of her younger brother and his wife and their eternal smiles, she felt deeply unhappy and acutely aware of her own desolation. She asked herself, "Why is this?" Thinking, tears welled up in her eyes…</p>
<p>At this moment, she sat cross-legged on the prayer mat, her palms joined in front of her chest. Following her master's chanting: and constantly striking the wooden fish. She glanced sideways at her master, seeing her looking down at the ground: at the same time, her shriveled lips were rapidly trembling. She lazily fixed her gaze on the wooden fish again. When the mallet struck it, a crisp sound was heard, which could be heard all the way down the mountain.</p>
<p>A lonely sound, a lonely life, woven into a net of sorrow; heavily shrouding her fragile heart. She was now faintly in a state of meditation. When she occasionally raised her head and caught a glimpse of the gold-plated bodhisattva in the shrine, her heart trembled even more violently. Hot tears streamed down her cheeks.</p>
<p>The sound of her striking the wooden fish gradually became dull.</p>
<h3>Remembering the Great Golden Pagoda</h3>
<p>— Yue Meng</p>
<p>On the train speeding towards Yangon, the first thing I saw rising high above the green foliage, giving travelers a smiling face from afar, was your figure, the Great Golden Pagoda! On the ship sailing from Yangon to the Indian Ocean, when I looked back and the outline of the metropolis had already disappeared, I suddenly saw you towering in the blue sky, as if reluctantly bidding farewell, and that was also your figure, the Great Golden Pagoda! I remember all of these, but what I will never forget is when, at dusk, the setting sun hung on your waist, and crows rose from the shade of the bodhi trees, scattering in the red sky of the evening, swirling into black stars, dancing around you, at this moment, seeing your languid appearance from afar, ah, how it makes people feel a sense of the rise and fall of empires! Or when I stroll along the banks of Green Lake at night, watching you covered in brilliant pearls, your soft golden reflection reflected in the lake, that expression full of the charm of a dancer going to a ball, how it makes people feel happy and delighted!</p>
<p>Now, at your feet, on the marble-paved path, are those grand scenes of offering flowers and incense still the same as they were back then? Are those good men and women in white clothes and floral skirts, whom I call gold worshippers, still singing and dancing below you during fine festivals, their interest undiminished from the past? Do you remember the tragic days when the monk U Wizaya, who advocated violent revolution and died on hunger strike in prison, was cremated by your side? Do you remember the days when the procession shouting "Simon go back" passed through the bustling city, circled to your feet, scattered into a sea of heads, and held demonstrations with prayers and speeches? Do you remember the great strike of five thousand Indian dockworkers, which turned the entire city into a bleak scene of death, and the incense and flowers there also showed an unprecedented dimness? Great Golden Pagoda, I remember all of these, and I miss them very much.</p>
<p>Please raise your head and look for me, are those thatched huts dotted in the golden rice fields still spewing blood-red crowns of fire and black columns of smoke? Are those brownish-yellow figures flashing in the green forests still holding up the white flags painted with gods and snakes? Great Golden Pagoda, which I have not seen for three years, please lift your toes and look for me.</p>
<h3>On "Branding" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the bankruptcy of Chinese rural villages has become more and more serious, and Zang Kejia will naturally notice this. However, due to a lack of social understanding, he failed to realistically sing about the lives of farmers in poetry. He sings about "refugees," "coal ghosts," "goddesses," "fishermen," "rickshaw pullers," "tavern waitresses," "fishmongers," etc., but he never grasped the lives and psychology of those people. He treats each image as a symbol, and describes it aesthetically. He shrouds the "refugees" in a decadent, dark atmosphere, without showing us their lives directly and realistically. He only gazes at them vaguely with his narrow humanitarianism. He does not indicate the relationship between the refugees and the collapse of the countryside. And in works such as "Old Horse," "Goddess," "Tavern Waitress," and "Fishmonger," he subjectively puts in his philosophy of stoicism. He does not objectively analyze their psychology based on those realistic images, but universally injects his own emotions into each of them. This is not realistic. In order to overcome this point, this young poet should abandon his empty and narrow philosophy, break open the hard shell of his small self, and do some solid work to study society's hardships. Because, unable to understand society, he sees pain and suffering as beautiful images, and says:</p>
<p>At the same time, you are afraid of overcoming it,</p>
<p>To be struck by a burst of emptiness from losing your opponent. ("Life")</p>
<p>This is an attitude of aestheticism. It is also because of this attitude that he depicts the "Coal Ghost" as a work of art:</p>
<p>Their faces are the night sky,</p>
<p>Sweat streams give it a Milky Way,</p>
<p>A pair of eyes radiating light,</p>
<p>Like two moons shining in the sky. ("Coal Ghost")</p>
<p>However, the poet's self-centered demands lead him to think conceptually of "strange heavenly fire." ("Heavenly Fire")</p>
<p>Lead him to think of "under the long wings of the night, there lies a bright dawn." ("Not long before that day.") Because he saw:</p>
<p>A young girl cannot get a meal,</p>
<p>Human flesh and pork are sold in the market the same. ("Heavenly Fire")</p>
<p>From miracles he thought of miracles. But what is a miracle?</p>
<h3>Southern Journey Miscellany (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>(5) New Year's Sundries</p>
<p>The inspector at the pier does not allow calendars combining the solar and lunar systems to land, and I cannot help but admire this. But here, even the director of the Public Security Bureau is busy making New Year's calls!</p>
<p>It is said that last year, the lunar calendar was not recognized here at all, and even New Year's greetings had to be whispered. Now, setting off firecrackers is a given, and some people even put up New Year couplets like "The Emperor's kindness is as vast as spring" on their doors!</p>
<p>Dragon boat lanterns are also one of the New Year's sundries. Each troupe has two dragon boat lanterns. At most, there are more than a dozen people, with all the stringed instruments and singing popular tunes. They can earn tens of thousands of coins a day. But this year, because the times are bad and there are many dragon boat lanterns, it is said that there will be some discounts.</p>
<p>Apart from dragon boat lanterns, the most common is the monk play. This only requires four or five children, each wearing a mask; three are monks, and one is a female pilgrim. From entering the temple to burn incense to the monks committing adultery, it can all be performed in two minutes. They perform this from house to house. The Fengyang flower drum has not been seen much in recent years, but it has been replaced by some heroes performing magic tricks. They swallow the sword into their stomach, leaving the hilt outside their mouth, shouting with their stomach straight. Once they receive the money, they pull out the sword and go to the next house. In addition, there are also tricks like playing horse lanterns and carrying the yellow dragon.</p>
<p>Another reason for the New Year's excitement should be gambling. Because on ordinary days, unless they are wealthy and powerful gentlemen, all gambling is strictly prohibited. But in the New Year, there are five days when people can indulge, which we call "Five Days of the King," meaning that in these five days, they can be as free as being crowned king.</p>
<p>The New Year is really a world for children. On New Year's Eve, they receive lucky money from their elders, and on New Year's Day, they put on brand new clothes, watch lanterns at home, and buy toys on the street. Even if poor children do not get these things, they can at least be scolded and beaten less.</p>
<p>In this respect, the lunar calendar may one day be abolished, but the children's happiness should be eternal.</p>
<h3>A Tentative Translation of the Book of Songs</h3>

<h3>Book Talk (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Based on the selfishness and secrecy of book collectors, as well as the disasters of war and fire, countless famous books and secret scripts are often permanently lost, which is a great regret. Therefore, on the other hand, "the crime of concealing books is greater than burning books." Li Qing (Yingbi) said: "Your younger brother has always thought that the crime of concealing books is greater than burning books. Truly seeing that once a book is concealed, it may be gnawed by rats, or damaged by silkworms and fish, or scattered by children and servants' windmills and thread books, if it is not passed on, it will be lost forever. Therefore, I sigh that the few volumes of Baopuzi can still be passed down to this day, not because of Bojie's secrecy in his tent, but because of the merit of those who took a few volumes from Bojie's tent. Your brother and I both want to be those takers, so we must borrow when we have books, copy when we borrow, and return when we copy. Rest assured, the promise will last forever, and it should be spread to all like-minded people. Be careful not to imitate Bojie's words, 'Only you and I share it, not spreading it widely.'" This opinion is extremely valuable. Only this method can make famous works and secret scripts be able to last forever in the world.</p>
<h3>Dusk (5)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>"Sister, why don't you stop, doing this will cause a headache again."</p>
<p>Qingsong raised her head, temporarily taking her pen away from the plain silk, her face suddenly showing a child-like joy, but it quickly disappeared, and she quietly replied:</p>
<p>"It's almost finished, when people are happy, they forget everything."</p>
<p>She smiled faintly, and Qingzhi walked over, looking at the Guanyin statue she was about to complete, outlined in light colors, the solemn and tranquil face of the Buddha, standing transcendently on a lotus petal.</p>
<p>"Isn't this considered finished?"</p>
<p>"The lotus petals haven't been colored yet, and I need to write a title."</p>
<p>She washed the used brush in the brush washer, mixed light pink, gently smeared it, and then used white water to depict the nearby areas even lighter. She used a brush to write the words "Qingsong bathed her hands and respectfully painted" in neat writing, and then comfortably lay in the round chair.</p>
<p>"I really like this painting, sister, I love the willow branch in her hand the most."</p>
<p>"That is to save people from the suffering of the world."</p>
<p>"What about those who have neither suffering nor happiness?"</p>
<p>"Then, ah, then, - then they should endure it well!"</p>
<p>Qingsong said faintly, like someone who had already escaped from the world, her eyes fixedly gazing out the window at the swaying poplar tree in the autumn wind.</p>
<p>"Let me play a tune."</p>
<p>Qingzhi said, taking down the xiao hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that my sister will feel tired again."</p>
<p>"No, I'm very happy, let me play a section of Zhaojun's Lament, okay?"</p>
<p>Qingzhi tried to blow it twice, and sat down on the chair near the window, her thin figure, like an old man in his twilight years, the slow and low sound of the xiao, slowly rose.</p>
<p>This was completely in great silence, almost even breathing stopped, in the sound of the xiao, one could find the sorrow that was difficult to make up for throughout the ages, and one could imagine such a beautiful woman, lonely and unhappy, shedding tears there, with the wind blowing south outside the tent. She envied that the grass could turn green every year, she also envied that the birds with wings could fly to the places they wanted to go, but she herself, had to spend this life in cold loneliness.</p>
<p>While playing, Qingzhi's eyes were gradually covered with a layer of tears, she tried to endure it, and widened her eyes even more; but the tears flowed itchily from her cheeks.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market Process Peaceful</h3>
<p>Silver Price Retracts, Guangdong Merchants Cover Shorts</p>
<p>Result: Continued Rise of Four Yuan and Five Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market continued to rise yesterday. The fluctuations were extremely narrow in half a day. People's hearts were calm, and the market was sluggish. Guangdong merchants were actively covering their short positions. Although there was supply, it was still able to support the market, but there was mostly consolidation. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw a decline in London and stability in the United States. The silver price for forward contracts on the Metals Exchange fell by 2.7 to 4 li. Both exchange rates rose and fell. The price of raw gold in London fell by 6.5 pence. American wheat fell by .625, American cotton fell by 4 points. The wool market opened and immediately rose to 46.7 yuan. Guangdong merchants significantly covered their short positions. Due to swap relationships, people's hearts were also good, and the situation became more attractive, once rising above 8 yuan. After opening, the recent US dollar was blocked by the bank, and the forward delivery was relatively sluggish and fell. When the exchange rate was announced by HSBC, both British and American were flat, and the market atmosphere became even more calm. After entering the market, the domestic market was slightly tight. There were rumors of greater profits and a rebound. Ultimately, due to the bank's unstable appetite and the elusive exchange rate market, it failed to rise again. Many took the opportunity to sell, and the situation still declined. The difference in half a day was only about 2 yuan. The peaceful state can be imagined. Although the March contract rose, there were few transactions. The Central Bank also had a sluggish appetite for cash and no transactions were heard. The expectations for this swap were mixed. It is generally expected that the short positions will post 7 yuan, with the total gold price calculated at 961 yuan. The market situation for half a day will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 947.9 yuan, an increase of 5.4 yuan compared to the previous closing. The opening price for goods was 7.8 yuan. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of 1 shilling, 4 pence and 5625 for British exchange and 35.125 yuan for US exchange. The Dalian merchants Hengyu Yuanchun and others were selling. Although Hengxing entered the market, it still retreated to 6.8 jiao. Sumitomo blocked the May US dollar at 4.375. Mitsui took the July US dollar at .75. Shengda Yida Yong purchased in batches, rising to 7.8 jiao. It was known that the exchange rate would not move when listed. Wanxing goods were all sold, falling to 6.6 jiao. After entering the market, there were rumors of greater profits, Shengda Dadecheng Yuanmao Yongshen Kang Hengxing Yifeng Yong and others continuously bought in, and the July US dollar at .6875 was difficult to settle, so it rose to 8.3 jiao. There was still supply of goods and the price fell. Although Hengyu Qingyong and others entered the market, Yuanchun Yuanheng Wanxing Fuyu and others supplied in succession, gradually falling to 6.4 jiao. The domestic market also became elusive. Yuanmao Yong Hengyu slightly purchased. The noon closing was 947 yuan. The goods were traded at the same price. After the market closed, Richang and others supplied some, and Cuitai slightly entered the market. The situation was slightly sluggish. It was found that the highest price in half a day was 948.3 yuan and the lowest price was 946.4 yuan, with only a 1.9 yuan difference. As a result, the closing price rose by 4.5 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was 34.75 yuan because the HSBC bank's US exchange rate listing did not move. The standard gold price was more than 995 yuan. According to the closing price, the margin was about 48 yuan, which was more than 4 yuan less than the previous closing. The closing price for the March contract was still calculated at more than 7.05 yuan. According to the closing price, the margin was less than about 5 yuan, which was slightly less than 2 yuan compared to the previous closing. This month's registration was 7.01 yuan, and April's was 9.47 yuan. The supplementary water in the morning was 7.01 yuan. The total gold price was calculated at 961 yuan. There were few transactions in the market, mostly 11 yuan more than the quoted price. At this price, the Tianjin merchants sold 200 taels to Yingfeng Heng, but this was a clearing transaction. In addition, Yingfeng Heng Tongfeng Yong Dadecheng sold more than 300 taels of 993 fineness to the silver furnace merchants, at 13.75 yuan more than the quoted price. The Central Bank did not have much activity.</p>
<p>There were not many transactions in the market. In summary, Shengda Yuanmao Yong Sida Fuchang Hengxing Ruixing Yuanchun Hongxing Bingxing and others were on the buying side, while Wanxing Zhifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang Yong Deshun Mao Fuyu Dadecheng Hengtai Dafa Yong Huixiang Hengyu Yifeng Yong Hengtai Hengchang Yong and others were on the selling side. Hongxing Yida Yong Dafa Yong Yifeng Yong and others had more complicated transactions. The Dalian merchants Wanxing did a total of about 1,100, clearing out more than 700. Shunli did a total of about 600, clearing in a small amount. The Guangdong merchants Shengda entered more than 2,000 in total. Bingyou Yuanmao Yong had quite a few clearing accounts. Hengxing entered more than 300, exiting a small amount. As of today, there were a total of 20,202 chips for the April contract, with a total of 37 long positions and 55 short positions. The total number of transactions on the day was 25,123.</p>
<p>The March contract's opening was preceded by Wanxing Yingfeng Heng and others needing to enter, lacking the head position, and the situation was quite boring. After a long time, Daxing Yong sold 63 to Xiangfeng for 700 yuan and 1 jiao, and the opening price was that price, 1.1 jiao higher than the previous closing, which was only obtained because HSBC's listing did not move. Then Yingfeng Heng and others wanted to buy, and the sellers were lacking, gradually rising to .008 jiao. The closing price was 700 yuan and .008 jiao. The lowest price in half a day was 700 yuan and .001 jiao, and the highest was .008 jiao. As a result, it was 1.8 jiao higher than the previous closing. As of today, there were a total of 19,362 chips for the March contract, with a total of 39 short positions and 35 long positions.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Short-Term Loan Collection Not Cumbersome</h3>
<p>Since the opening of business in the first month of the abolished calendar this year, due to the market being bleak and commerce being sluggish, the uses of silver dollars have not been very smooth, resulting in a dull market atmosphere and cash failing to circulate widely, so foreign exchange has not moved and has consistently been short-term. The morning and afternoon markets yesterday were the same, and the clearing was also short-term without adding water. Although transactions in exchange bills slightly increased, if this continues to be sluggish, it is feared that it will be difficult to see a major improvement in the situation. Yesterday morning, transfers were more than 4.1 million, new transactions were more than 300,000, afternoon market transactions were more than 200,000, and transactions in the small general meeting were more than 400,000. Bank collection: foreign banks collected more than 1.5 million in bill funds, various goods exchange collateral miscellaneous funds collected more than 4.6 million, and warehouse entry was 500,000; Chinese banks collected more than 2.1 million in bill funds, various goods exchange tax miscellaneous funds collected more than 4.78 million, and warehouse entry was 300,000; Japanese banks collected more than 1.3 million in bill funds, various miscellaneous funds collected more than 3.5 million, and warehouse exit was 300,000; money shops' foreign public bills collected more than 41.1 million, foreign clearing funds collected more than 3.7 million, various routes' exchange funds were more than 300,000, cash collection was 400,000 to 500,000, foreign collateral transactions took back and redeemed more than 500,000, new made were more than 700,000, banknote collection and issuance were more than 1.5 million, customer routes' source was 300,000, withdrawal was 150,000. Also, the total number of exchanges on the 14th by the local bill of exchange was: silver dollars 5,559,439.35 yuan, including 2,700,060.09 yuan in silver dollars and 2,888,040.26 yuan in exchange silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary Coins Have Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of small silver coins in Jiangnan fell by 5 yuan in the morning market, to 815 yuan, and continued to fall by 5 yuan in the afternoon market, to 810 yuan, for a total decrease of 10 yuan.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Hovering with a Softening Trend</h3>
<p>Market Conditions Appear to Be More Active</p>
<p>Various Bonds Fall by Five Cents to Twenty-Five Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the Commercial Securities Exchange was slightly more active. Overall, it cannot yet be said to be in a hovering state. There were unsubstantiated rumors in the market, but they were insufficient to have an impact. However, there was a slight appearance of weakness from various parties, and market prices showed signs of fatigue. Hovering and brewing have been going on for a long time. These phenomena are not yet formal changes. Large players are maintaining a defensive posture. Although the "Four" bonds were being bought on the floor, the volume was limited. Although the "Five" bonds were being sold, the selling was not enthusiastic. Transactions were still dominated by retail investors, with relatively lively activity. Trading volume gradually increased, and it is possible that the market will gradually become more active, with potentially larger price fluctuations. The current situation is temporarily viewed as soft, but there is no major downward trend expected. At the opening yesterday morning, there was some demand for "Four" bonds, and sellers were relatively eager. "Five" bonds were also being sold, and market prices declined by ten to twenty cents. In the second session, retail investors showed some willingness to sell, and the market remained soft, declining by approximately another ten cents. Although still in a hovering state, the market was more active. Investor sentiment was generally slightly bearish. There was no turnaround in the afternoon. Opening and closing prices mostly remained unchanged, with some fluctuations of around ten cents. At the close, the "Twenty Customs" forward contracts were the strongest, up twenty-five cents. Overall, market prices fell by five cents to twenty-five cents across the board. Total trading volume was approximately 7,730,000 yuan. There was no spot trading. The highs, lows, and changes compared to the previous day are listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Corporate Bonds Reach New High</h3>
<p>A report from New Fohg Hong on the 13th stated that the New York stock market initially fluctuated due to the uncertain Frasier bonus proposal, with no clear trend. Later, due to positive railway freight and other commercial reports, railway and oil stocks rose slightly. In the small exchange, oil and public utility stocks were in demand. Corporate bonds reached a new high. US and foreign government bonds were also firmer than before, but German government bonds were weak. Total daily trading volume was 1.27 million shares. (Wheat) High prices could not be sustained, and speculators turned to selling. The news was unimportant. (Cotton) initially rose due to inflationary sentiment caused by the veterans' bill and the silver bill. In reality, both proposals had little chance of passing. The Reconstruction Bureau's proposal to limit yarn mill working hours to 30 hours per week caused concern among factories and buyers, leading to profit-taking at high prices. Buyers were waiting for a larger reaction. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks　104.00　Down 0.23</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks　49.30　Up 0.65</p>

<h3>Reduced Working Hours May Lead to Increased Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending stronger, with rising prices becoming more intense. Due to previously pessimistic views on the market outlook, general retail investors were selling off, so a positive news triggered a more drastic rebound. Today, manufacturers, in order to maintain their factories, convened a meeting of various factories at 3 PM to discuss ways to unite. The general idea is to cooperate to maintain the yarn market, and potentially reduce working hours. As a result, the news spread, short sellers actively covered their positions, and buying surged. According to some investigations, foreign firms were said to have sold off more than 30,000 bales in the standard market, so old standard yarns may see another drastic change.</p>
<h3>Standard Yarn Prices Rise by About Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market was flat for imported cotton, but there was a lack of new sellers in the market, and more traders were covering their positions, leading to a price increase. Prices for various months rose by 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 cents. In the afternoon, buying interest was strong, and the rising trend was even more intense. Prices for various months rose by 1.3, 7, and 8 cents. The total daily trading volume was 45,600 bales. The sellers were: Tongfu 1,150 bales, Yuanda 1,900 bales, Xincheng 1,650 bales, Mingde 1,600 bales, Yuantai 1,100 bales, Jinchang 800 bales, and Renfeng 800 bales. The buyers were: Yongchang 1,650 bales, Senkang 1,300 bales, Shenchang 1,000 bales, Huikang 1,950 bales, Fuda 1,050 bales, Changfeng 2,850 bales, and Xiesheng 800 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>540 Bales of Yarn Sold</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. According to statistics, various merchant groups bought a total of 540 bales throughout the day, and prices rose by 50 cents to 1 yuan. The buying amounts for each merchant group are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 235, Anhui 40, Ningbo 30, Xiamen 5, Guangdong 110, Fujian 10, Shantou 95, Luzhou 15</p>
<h3>Standard Cotton Bullish Sentiment Not Strong</h3>
<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the overall trend was still sluggish. Due to the weak trend of Indian cotton and the talk of yarn factories reducing working hours, bullish sentiment was weak. Spot cotton trading in the market was extremely dull. However, the US cotton market was relatively calm. The future of the cotton market is uncertain.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Cotton Market Turns Better in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The opening of the standard cotton market was weak, following the poor external conditions. Prices for various months fluctuated by 5 cents to 1.5 cents. In the afternoon, due to the intense rise in the yarn market, the cotton market was lifted, and prices for various months rose by 1.5 cents. The total daily trading volume was 52,300 dan. The sellers were: Gengfeng 3,800 dan, Shenchang 4,700 dan, Renfeng 2,400 dan, Xincheng 3,700 dan, Xinheng 1,100 dan, Jifeng 1,800 dan, Tongfu 1,100 dan, Dafeng 1,800 dan, Yuanda 1,300 dan, and Huikang 2,300 dan. The buyers were: Changfeng 6,300 dan, Senkang 2,700 dan, Chunj 1,800 dan, Xiesheng 3,400 dan, Deji 2,100 dan, Hengde 1,600 dan, Taixing 1,000 dan, and Zhenda 1,000 dan.

<h3>Mills Show Slight Interest in Spot Cotton</h3>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is stagnant. Inland mills are showing slightly more interest. The sources include 50 bales of Yao cotton. Spot cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Hankou</p>
<p>High Grade Cotton 41.50 Hengfeng Mill bought 60 pieces Spot delivery to the mill</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 51.25 Yufeng Mill bought 83 pieces Spot delivery</p>

<p>Shandong Cotton 46.00 Zhenxin Mill bought 106 pieces Spot delivery</p>
<h3>Hunan Province to Clear Existing Yarn Stock</h3>
<p>More than 6,000 pieces of accumulated yarn</p>
<p>No goods will be processed until cleared</p>
<p>Changsha, Hunan has more than 6,000 pieces of 20-count and 16-count cotton yarn in stock. Sales are sluggish. On the 8th of this month, the Hunan Provincial Cotton Yarn Management Office held its first joint meeting with merchants, chaired by Director Yang Boheng. The following resolutions were passed: (1) For the 16-count and 20-count cotton yarns, the Management Office will notify all merchants to temporarily suspend the processing of import goods from today (the 8th). After the existing stock of the said yarn sells well, a meeting will be convened to discuss other measures. (2) For 16-count and 20-count cotton yarns ordered by yarn merchants from factories in Shanghai and Hankou before the meeting date, but not yet shipped, evidence of the order (such as telegrams and order forms from Shanghai and Hankou) must be submitted to the Management Office for registration by the 10th of this month. Only after the Management Office verifies the authenticity will it be considered valid. Late registrations will not be accepted. (3) For 16-count and 20-count cotton yarns purchased by yarn merchants from factories in Shanghai and Hankou that have already been shipped, all must be transported and imported by the 15th of this month. However, this does not apply to goods for which evidence has been verified by the Management Office and registered, proving that the order was placed before the meeting date; otherwise, registration will not be accepted. (4) For both 20-count and 16-count cotton yarns, the stock accumulated in the city should be promoted first. If the yarn of Brand A of a certain count is sold out, it should be supplemented by the yarn of Brand B of the same count. Without the approval of the second meeting, no goods of the same count of any brand may be ordered from factories in Shanghai and Hankou. (5) During the period of suspension of imports, the prices of 16-count and 20-count yarns in the city should be based on the market prices discussed daily by the Shanghai Yarn Merchants Association based on the Shanghai and Hankou market conditions, and should not be arbitrarily raised or lowered or manipulated. (6) If any of the above articles are violated, the Management Office will investigate and store all of the yarn and resolve the matter at the second joint meeting.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Market for Japanese Yarn Very Active</h3>
<p>According to Tianjin reports, the cotton yarn trade in the city has good appetite from importers. The market sentiment is still calm. Gaoyang merchants bought 42-count Shuiyue two-strand yarn at 276.50 yuan, 32-count Sansong at 228 yuan, and 16-count Songhe yarn at 173.50 yuan. Xianghe merchants bought 20-count Hongxi yarn at 173 yuan, and 10-count Sanguang yarn at 152 yuan. Botou merchants bought 16-count Changshou yarn at 174 yuan, and Wolugou merchants bought 16-count Xiantao yarn at 172.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Stagnant, No Distinctive Features</h3>
<p>Yesterday's US cotton market was stagnant and lacked distinctive features. Traders were adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The market initially rose due to positive news from Liverpool, but then fell back due to selling from the South. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points and futures prices fell by 1 point to 4 points. Liverpool spot cotton rose by 5 points and futures rose by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to profit-taking by bulls and selling by speculators, but then rebounded as short sellers covered their positions. As a result, Pingar rose by 2 rupees and 2.5 annas, Omra rose by 1.5 rupees, and Bailoxi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 13th).</p>
<p>|US Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | National Currency | English Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | National Currency|</p>

<h3>Grain Industry Outside Short Covering for Near-Term Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a initially flat and then improving trend in the morning across various months. As foreign wheat quotations in Chicago and Canada were down approximately two to three cents, the opening prices were soft. Later, because factories continued to refuse to sell and outside short positions gradually moved to cover, sentiment was lifted as there was more buying than selling. The afternoon opening continued to show improvement, and although trading wasn't very active, short positions continued to cover smoothly. Major factories intended to maintain prices and didn't offer any product, further boosting sentiment. However, northern merchants were still selling due to inactive sales. As a result, the current month was up 1.5 cents from the previous day, April was up 1.25 cents, May, June, and July were up 2 cents, and August was down 1.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Wheat Suddenly Drops Seven to Eight Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market showed a sharp decline in the near term, while the far term was stable. Foreign wheat prices in Chicago and Canada were down approximately two to three cents, but investor sentiment hadn't fully focused on it. Later, the market suddenly received a stimulus, likely due to the fact that prices couldn't be pushed up further. The squeezed gains of the current month, initially due to a lack of goods, saw a situation where the primary number offered foreign wheat for delivery, but the bulls became powerless and unanimously gave up. The market suddenly plummeted. The morning opening was 4.1 yuan, and the afternoon offer of 1 yuan was rejected, showing a lack of interest in price increases. Far-term trading was limited, and prices were stable. As a result, the current month plummeted 8 cents from the previous day, April fell 7 cents, and August fell 1 cent. The spot wheat market remained stable and improving, with high-grade goods up another 5 cents. Bengbu wheat opened at 3.61 yuan, Yingzhou wheat at 3.65 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 3.65 yuan, Shandong wheat at 3.68 yuan, and South Suzhou wheat at 3.67 yuan, totaling 2,500 yuan, and was reportedly purchased by Fuxin Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Lower Reaches Rice Supply Arrives, Turning Turbulent</h3>
<p>Thick粳 Rice Drops Another 5 Cents...Yin Yuan Rice Drops Nearly 10 Cents</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources for various merchants were hindered by the previous days of wind and rain, but arrived in full force yesterday with clear weather. The docks were very crowded, with an estimated 80-90 ships (over 10,000 stones), mostly thick粳 rice and various types of rice. Late rice accounted for nearly 40 ships. Sales-wise, although the appetite of the street shops was relatively strong, the overall situation appeared ordinary after a long period of weakness. Coupled with the sudden surge in supply, an oversupply was almost inevitable. Therefore, the market for common varieties of 粳 rice from the Su, Tong, and South Port merchants was soft, and prices fell by 5 cents. As for the late rice varieties from Qingjiao, Songjiang, Xishi, and Lian merchants, although the supply was also significant, fortunately, both the northern and southern foreign merchants showed strong interest. Therefore, the initial market started off with a slight drop, but until the close, there was no significant decline. A total of 3,400-3,500 packages were taken in, and sellers took the opportunity to call for higher prices. As a result, the market was stable due to the tight buying from the Hakka traders. Du Yangjian’s sales were similar, with no significant gains or losses. The supply of Yin Yuan rice was relatively large, and sales were limited. The market was weak, with prices down by nearly a foot. Bian Yuan rice was scarce, showing a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 32-33 ships from various merchants in the lower reaches arrived. There was still some demand for various goods in the market. The price of white 粳 rice and 柆尖 rice fell by nearly 10 cents. High-quality early thin rice was stable, while medium and low-quality rice was also weaker by several cents. Yangbu Kejian, Bai Yuan, and Yin Yuan rice were stable.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice Rises by 10 Cents</h3>
<p>Merchants from Fujian and Zhejiang Are Very Eager to Buy</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Ke Xian rice was initially weak, but Kehua was very popular. The market sentiment was tight, and prices were rising. High and low grades all rose, increasing by 7-8 cents to 12-3 cents compared to the previous market. High-quality goods were particularly scarce, and Hakka merchants were very interested in buying. It is expected that there will be a need for continued buying. Yesterday, Fuzhou had the best demand, buying 1,000 packages of Jiangxi Jiwan rice, 1,000 packages of Hunan Jiyou Jijing rice, 1,000 packages of Mingguang coarse rice, 1,000 packages each of Quanzhou machine-processed red rice and Xuzhou machine-processed Xian rice, 300 packages of coarse red rice, 1,500 packages of Ningbo desalted Shashi coarse rice, 300 packages of Nanjing coarse rice, and 350 packages of Wenzhou machine-processed early rice. More than 400 packages of Ji Cao rice were purchased by local shops, while 50 packages of Wuxi Ji Yuan were purchased by Fuzhou. A total of 7,880 packages were sold. Rice was purchased by merchants from Fujian province, and the markets in Quanzhou and Fuzhou in Fujian province were still interested in buying. It is expected that shipments will continue today and tomorrow, so the market outlook is still promising.</p>
<h3>Soybean Market Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market was active, but actual sales were difficult to develop. Although it was once driven by bean cake sales, the abundance of goods led to lower prices, making it difficult to maintain sentiment. Yesterday's selling prices were not significantly different from the previous market. Factories sold six to seven cars of Yingzhou soybeans, priced from 2.52 yuan to 2.50 yuan. Three cars of Bengbu soybeans were sold at prices ranging from 2.45 yuan to 2.40 yuan. More than 1,000 packages of Dangshan soybeans were sold at prices ranging from 2.52 yuan to 2.48 yuan. In addition, four to five cars of Guide soybeans, Feihe soybeans, and Zhengyangguan soybeans were distributed to the inland and local markets.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Domestic Sliced Green Sugar Arrives in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Association's opening price for rough brown and white sugar was still 19.63 yuan, with slight transactions. The prices of Taikoo sugar and local factory's refined sugar were the same as yesterday. Dozens of packages of domestic Double Cover white sugar were opened at a price of 17 yuan. Over a hundred packages of Huizhou red sugar were opened at a price of 13.55 yuan. The higher grades of Chaoqing were slightly opened, with prices ranging from 11.7 yuan to 11.3-4 yuan. Yesterday, more than 8,000 boxes of Guangdong sliced green sugar arrived on the new ship from Taikoo Company, turning the market sentiment weak. Over two hundred boxes were opened yesterday at a price of 9 yuan.</p>
<p>Dried Goods</p>
<h3>Jinshan Round Lychees Have Sluggish Sales and Falling Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, the supply of Guangdong's Jinshan round lychees has been steadily increasing, while sales have been flat. Therefore, the asking prices have softened again. It was recently heard that Guangdong merchants opened a hundred boxes, with prices dropping by 3-4 yuan compared to before. The higher grades, such as Ruichang brand sun-dried lychees, were only opening at 75 yuan. Chrysanthemum rice, such as all-yellow high-grade rice, had long been sold out and the supply was cut off for a long time, so the market was popular and prices soared. Currently, large-grain, all-yellow, sand-free rice is trading at 40 yuan. Yesterday, it was heard that the dealers received a letter from the producing area stating that shipments had already been made and were expected to arrive soon. It is expected that there will be a situation of insufficient supply at that time.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Asphalt Selling Prices Fall Daily</h3>
<p>Since asphalt prices have repeatedly fallen in various producing areas, the market has become depressed. Arrivals have gradually increased. Recently, the Han market has seen a drop of 15 yuan per dan for Macheng oil. Few merchants are buying, and supply exceeds demand. Although prices have fallen to this level, which hasn't been seen in years, soap factories still find the prices high and unprofitable. The use for candles is limited, and the accumulation of goods in producing areas such as western Hubei is still high. Therefore, the market trend is still weak. Local merchants, seeing the sluggish spring sales, are unwilling to stock up too much. Due to the arrival of goods, merchants have not yet opened their prices. Selling prices are gradually falling. The price of Ming Chong Jing oil is 20.045 yuan per dan, Ping Jing oil is 20 yuan, and Macheng oil is 18 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Peanut Oil Deliveries Arrive Continuously</h3>
<p>--Sluggish Sales--</p>
<p>The peanut oil market is trending downwards due to the weakness of soybean oil. Recently, supplies have been arriving continuously, and inventories are piling up. Only Zhejiang province still has some transactions, but prices are low. Yesterday the downward trend opened. Compared to last week, prices dropped by 8 cents.

<h3>New York Raw Silk Sales Gradually Decreasing</h3>
<p>(Less Than 40,000 Bales in the Previous Month) The Shanghai Raw Silk Export Association received a telegram from the New York Silk Association yesterday, stating that although New York silk mills are weaving spring silk fabrics, due to world trends and fashion trends, most are focusing on man-made silk, leading to even lower consumption of raw silk. Last month (February), New York City silk mills consumed only 39,021 bales of raw silk from China, Japan, Italy, and France. Japanese silk accounted for more than 90%, and Chinese silk accounted for less than 1,000 bales, a decrease of 1,933 bales compared to January.</p>
<p>(Silk Filature Long Filaments Supply Slightly Smoother) Wuxi silk filatures are actively reeling silk as spring cocoons are about to hatch. Many who have surplus cocoons are renting filatures to reel silk. As a result, three or four more have started operation since the lunar new year. The production of long silk filaments has gradually increased and the supply is slightly smoother. In the past half-month, Wuxi silk filatures received a total of 86 bales of long silk filaments.</p>
<p>(Comparison of Waste Silk Exports Over Two Years) China's yellow and white silk and silk cocoon waste (referred to as waste silk by customs) also occupy an important position in export goods. Each year, 60-70,000 dan are exported to Europe and the Americas. In recent years, affected by Japanese silk waste (i.e., waste silk) and man-made silk, waste silk exports have plummeted. According to the survey, from June 1, last year to March 10, this year, a total of 19,901 dan of waste silk were exported, compared to 19,259 dan in the same period last year, an increase of 642 dan.</p>
<p>(Filature Ashes Primarily For Short Covering) Silk mills in Europe and America are still reducing consumption of spring silk fabrics, while Japanese silk is being sold aggressively. Sales of Chinese silk filatures have not improved. Shanghai's American banks are primarily engaged in short covering. Lianna and others imported 30 bales of white factory waste and 10 bales of gray waste, and prices remained flat and weak.</p>

<h3>On the Reforestation Movement</h3>
<p>— Liu An</p>
<p>In the past, our Chinese Arbor Day was on Qingming Day, but now it has been changed to the anniversary of Premier Sun's death, and Arbor Day has been expanded and enlarged to Reforestation Movement Day. This is a clear symbol of "national rejuvenation." As this national reforestation movement is underway, newspapers have special issues dedicated to the reforestation movement, promoting and encouraging it with a refreshing outlook.</p>
<p>One university professor published an article arguing that the only way to alleviate rural bankruptcy is through reforestation. His argument has approximately three points:</p>
<p>(1) Production increases year by year and is stable.</p>
<p>(2) Reduce the number of farmers running to the cities.</p>
<p>(3) Seek fundamental improvements in water conservancy.</p>
<p>From the above three statements, one can understand the effects of forestry: it can increase and stabilize production, gradually reduce the number of unemployed farmers, and fundamentally improve water conservancy. These three are the most urgent problems to be solved in rural areas. Without seeking increased and stable production, farmers cannot eat their fill and stay warm; without gradually reducing the number of unemployed farmers, farmers become evildoers in society; without fundamentally improving water conservancy, one will inevitably face frequent floods and droughts. Therefore, solving these three major problems is to save the countryside. To completely solve these three major problems, only forestry can succeed. So, in summary, forestry is the only way to save the countryside. Now is the Arbor Day season, hoping everyone will rouse their spirits and work together on reforestation, turning the country's barren mountains and vacant lands completely into forest areas. Saving the nation and ensuring its survival depends on this one move.</p>
<p>This kind of contribution strategy of "saving the nation and ensuring its survival depends on this one move" will naturally be noted by the National Government; if the Rural Reconstruction Committee also adopts this suggestion as a resolution, vigorously taking action on forestry to save and revive the countryside, then "saving the nation and ensuring its survival" may be successful. However, we dare not fully agree. May I ask, in the country's mountainous areas, such as the total area of 567,133,003,689 mu surveyed by the Ministry of Statistics in the 18th year of the Republic, are they all barren mountains and vacant lands without forests? Every year, countless farmers rely on the trees (such as mulberry trees, fruit trees, etc.) and agricultural products of those mountainous areas for their livelihood. However, the products of mountainous areas, like the products of fields, must be taxed. If farmers want to engage in forestry, may I ask, some mountain lands are government property and some are privately owned by large landlords. Where do farmers get the money to rent or buy mountain land for reforestation? If large landlords are encouraged to engage in forestry, naturally "in lean years," they can "engage in forest work, either planting, felling, transporting, or manufacturing" in their forest land to profit. However, it is difficult to say whether farmers "can be accommodated as much as possible" to work. Moreover, in the current sluggish market for timber, even if large landlords regard forests as a major product and hire farmers to fell them, they may not be able to profit. Once large landlords calculate the balance, no one wants to do this loss-making business. Then, even if the country's barren mountains and vacant lands are widely forested, where can farmers find work to do, and how can the number of unemployed farmers gradually decrease? Then, what is meant by "forestry is the only way to save the countryside"? The so-called "saving the nation and ensuring its survival depends on this one move," I am afraid the reasons are not sufficient.</p>
<p>However, reforestation is a fundamental way to manage water conservancy, which should be supported and promoted to observe its success.</p>
<h3>Originally... "His Frustration?"</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>These past few days, friends have seen that Aji's expression is very negative and decadent. He's mentally distracted and listless. His attitude has also changed a lot. He—is too lazy to move anything, and his behavior and actions are completely different from what they were a month ago. Sometimes, he's just seen pacing alone, sighing frequently with furrowed brows. It seems that there is something difficult to tell people on his mind. Originally, living in this society, the kind of distress that young people feel is nothing more than the issue of career prospects. However, for someone like Aji, who has a suitable job and a good environment, and whose family burden is not too heavy, such distress is always considered incomprehensible.</p>
<p>One day, Lao Zhang and I finished watching a movie and wanted me to check on his recent condition. We walked into his bedroom and saw him sitting idly on a chair, staring blankly at the sky.</p>
<p>So, Lao Zhang gently asked him from behind.</p>
<p>"Hey! Aji! What's been up these past few days?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Fine... Haven't seen you in days. Where did you come from?" He replied, seemingly startled by the sudden voice from behind, while also displaying a forced smile.</p>
<p>"We came specially to visit, to visit you."</p>
<p>"Thank you, thank you."</p>
<p>"What have you been doing for amusement lately?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Sitting around, too lazy to move. I don't feel interested in anything. Anyway, wasting time like this, I think it's very worthwhile," he said, sighing heavily.</p>
<p>Lao Zhang wanted to ask why he was so negative and lazy, hoping that he would say it, or that friends could offer him some mental comfort. So he asked again:</p>
<p>"May I ask you, how is Miss Yong lately? I heard that your love is very passionate, and I imagine it will soon become a reality!"</p>
<p>"Don't mention it. I hate women to the extreme. Because of women, I've become so negative. Miss Yong is engaged to another man. After all, women flow like water. Who can love each other like this forever?" He shrugged, expressing infinite sadness. "Alas! Four or five years of friendship and love can change. No wonder Aji's negativity is an inevitable fact," I said sympathetically.</p>
<p>"Ah! So his frustration is a broken heart," Lao Zhang finally understood. (Unpaid)</p>
<h3>About Crying</h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>Humans are artistic, and in terms of actions, thoughts, appearance, and inner feelings, there are plenty of laughable and highly artistic elements. For example, "crying," this expression of inner feelings, is a good example. Talking slowly about it is enough to make an article of about a thousand words.</p>
<p>When a baby bids farewell to the womb and lands with a "cry," some people say that it is the first cry of "life's pain." Why not another expression first? Although it is said to be a natural instinct, it is actually close to this kind of "pain theory." This "cry" is a manifestation of true feelings, so it is often recalled and yearned for by older people. However, people will still "cry" when they grow up.</p>
<p>In old China, five- or six-year-old girls were about to grow braids and bind their feet. Although there were many harms in growing braids, the pain seemed unspeakable. Only foot binding was a uniquely female "pain" that no one could deny. Everyone who was bound cried. But no matter how much you cried to heaven and earth, feet had to be bound at that time.</p>
<p>Boys also had a kind of "cry," which was when they attended private schools and began studying, and they were always crying. This kind of crying was a little bit like making it clear that it was soy sauce, and it was also a simple snapshot of education in the past China.</p>
<p>Growing up a bit more, it was different again. For example, when some relatives died, the younger female generation mostly cried very vigorously, especially at the memorial service. When the ritualist shouted to express grief, the women cried out in unison, almost like a musical team. This kind of crying was inevitably a bit mechanical and hypocritical. Another scene that could not be avoided was when getting married, on a colorful sedan chair covered with flowers, there was no one who did not tear up, crying so humorously. Why did they cry? Only the bride herself knew.</p>
<p>On the men's side, there were also people who cried and times when they cried. For example, a pale-faced scholar had taken exams for many years. Every time, he felt that his article was very well written, but often someone reached the age of sixty and still had not obtained a red hat. At this time, it is said that in addition to looking up at the roof and sighing, scolding the examiners for not having eyes, they also cried bitterly that their ancestral graves were not effective. Another was a wife who only knew how to give birth to girls, and the concubine who was added to the family was also the same. Then, thinking of the lack of successors, they could not help but cry loudly and specially.</p>
<p>The above counts as various kinds of crying in the old era and old society. Speaking of today's new society, crying is still just as popular. New-style ladies have several ways of crying. For example, when they lose love or their husbands die, they often cry very fiercely. But in the midst of crying, they often receive the love of new lovers. Perhaps this is why new-style women are new. Their emotional seeds are so turbulent, crying easily occurs and easily disappears. Most of the time, when they want to coerce something in front of their husbands and cannot achieve their goal, using the "crying" trick has the hope of a satisfactory solution. This counts as their "crying coquetry." Or, the person they married is not suitable, but they themselves are so delicate, and the man is a country bumpkin. It is inevitable to cry behind people's backs that a phoenix has followed a crow. Or, discovering in the mirror that their youth has faded, and that the standards for choosing a partner in the past were too harsh, the men who are pursuing them are gradually becoming scarce. On lonely nights, they must cry painfully.</p>
<p>We cannot see any meaning in these. Only the crying of women during childbirth because they cannot bear the pain of childbirth is truly great and worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Speaking of ordinary young gentlemen, they also love to cry like people in the old era, but what they cry about is slightly different. For example, crying for lost love is the most common cry among young people. Some even cry while in love. Not getting a doctorate or master's degree, or being unemployed and drifting around, does not cause them to cry. What "national crisis" is even less likely to arouse a trace of "crying." Even if there is crying, it is fake, to gain fame and seek praise. It seems that I only read in the newspaper that some adult gentleman "cried with a choked voice" during a speech. That was certainly crying...</p>
<p>I feel that crying is a bit mysterious and meaningless. Even if it is an unavoidable expression of humans, I also think that real "crying" and real tears should be for the masses of humanity. Furthermore, what we expect is that humans should not have crying or tears, only strength and blood.</p>
<h3>To Those Who Cry for Ai Xia</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Ai Xia has been dead for quite some time. Many newspapers and magazines have published several special issues to commemorate her "life" and "death," and the writers who admired her have shed countless compassionate tears. Furthermore, her death has stimulated the feelings of some young men and women in Shanghai society, questioning the causes and consequences of Ai Xia's suicide, and similarly exploring what life is all about!</p>
<p>I am very surprised that Ai Xia's death is more sensational to society than her life, because I have seen many people die—suicide, death from illness, death from hunger and cold, wrongful death (including bloody death). I don't know how many men, women, old, and young die like this every day, but they all die without leaving a shadow on society, and no one has held a memorial service for him or her in newspapers and magazines. Why is Ai Xia's death different from ordinary people?</p>
<p>Here, I want to ask those writers who "write with tears" to commemorate Ai Xia, and the editors of those newspapers and magazines, are you crying and writing about Ai Xia's death because she is a person in the arts, she is a contemporary star, and she is a modern beauty? If this is the case, it is a romantic mood of pitying the flower and cherishing the jade that is set into motion in the heart; creating articles and compiling publications, such things are of no benefit to the dead or to society.</p>
<p>A person's death, no matter what, should be sympathized with. Ai Xia's death is naturally one that people should sympathize with. Living people should bear responsibility for death: natural death and artificial death, or suicide and death by others. This is also a matter of reason. Here, I want to ask those who cry for Ai Xia again, do you cry for other dead people with the same tears?</p>
<p>Today's world is indeed suffering from a great calamity, and everyone is living and struggling bitterly. If they cannot live or cannot survive, some people are willing to die. Recently, many people have been discussing the issue of suicide, and everyone is only groping for the reasons, but cannot find a way to prevent suicide. The reason for not finding a way is that society does not have a force to prevent suicide from arising, that is, society does not have a band of connection with each other, and people are all scattered and indifferent.</p>
<p>In this human world with scattered and indifferent relationships, the band of connection for survival has been cut off. If we look up at the dead on the Bund, most of them are without help and without relatives, so that they have lost their belief in survival and have to die with hatred. Furthermore, inferring from those heroic spirits who died for lost love, the reason why these people must die is that this society does not have a suitable thing for him or her to develop in another direction. An empty and melancholic life, if you don't seek death, why stay in the world?</p>
<p>In front of us, this realistic society, the misery of survival has reached its peak. There is no connection between people, and even human virtues, righteousness, etc., have all disappeared. The great drama of struggling and tragic fighting makes many people with rich emotions and lofty ideals unwilling to live in this world in a perfunctory manner.</p>
<p>Discussing the issue of suicide, if we want to propose effective ways to prevent suicide, we can only strive to restore the band of connection for human survival, so that people are related to each other and feel each other's pain, and everyone is full of energy and embraces an ideal of noble human life. To put it concretely, that is, to strive to transform the real society and realize a new social life.</p>
<p>All these words, in the final analysis, require a force, which is how to create a force that leads society forward.</p>
<p>Many people focus on expressing themselves in a negative way and then it's over. This is the biggest crisis. Several articles have told the story of Ai Xia's life and death in detail, praising her courage and praising her extraordinariness. Doing so is tantamount to encouraging those who have the intention to commit suicide to covet this posthumous honor, and those who write these articles have unintentionally become teachers of suicide.</p>
<p>There is no need to cry and commemorate Ai Xia's death. Moreover, I believe that this is because of the numbness and indifference of social public opinion that such a thing has happened!</p>
<p>I do not sympathize with Ai Xia's death. I only feel that the cutting off of the band of connection for human survival is a painful thing. I hope that social public opinion will no longer be so numb and indifferent from now on.</p>
<h3>The Failure of the First Social Encounter</h3>

<p>Girl, I love your simplicity. You came back from Shanghai. How come the prosperity didn't taint you? This is why I admire you! He leaned against the train door! Facing me, in the rumbling sound of the train, I heard him say that. I thought he wouldn't say such a strange sentence, because at that time, I was indeed wearing a very plain cloth gown, so I didn't think he had other intentions, and I didn't understand that what he said was a way to get acquainted and please people. Although he had been introduced to me once by someone else before. But without direct conversation, this time on the train was an unexpected encounter.</p>
<p>Back home, I didn't remember this incident. The next morning, a postman came outside, not to deliver a letter, but a bulky package. I thought who would send me a gift in this rural place? The appearance of the thing was rectangular, and before opening it, I guessed several parts, knowing that it was books. Sure enough, he sent me four famous novels. This is good, from this time on, I broke the bad habit of not liking to read books. After that, he continued to send them to me, and I could receive almost fifty Chinese and foreign masterpieces within a month. This forced me to feel very embarrassed and very afraid that he would write to me to discuss the issues in the books, then I wouldn't be able to answer, wouldn't it be too embarrassing? So I also used a method to encourage myself, arranging all the books on the table in front of the bed, limiting myself to reading several books every few days. This slowly cultivated my habit of reading.</p>
<p>Naturally, he gave me sincere guidance. In the correspondence, he never talked about emotional matters from beginning to end. He made my heart quiet. I was happy that he gave me a path to learning. I accepted every book he sent me, treating him as my own brother, or rather, as a teacher!</p>
<p>Not long after, I was staying at my aunt's house in Nanjing, and he came to invite me to go to Hangzhou to stroll around. At the time, I also planned to stay at an old classmate's place for a few days, so I agreed to go with him.</p>
<p>The train arrived in Hangzhou in the afternoon. We wanted to find a hotel to tidy up our clothes, wash our faces, and eat something before seeing friends. But after a short rest, he said, "It's time for dinner, wouldn't it be embarrassing to find people? It's better to go early tomorrow morning. I'll get you an extra room!"</p>
<p>The next day, I took a small suitcase and took a rickshaw to my friend's place. But looking at the address, the people in the house were not the people I knew. This surprise made my heart panic. Standing at someone else's door, looking for a long time, there was no way but to return to the hotel with him. At this time, I felt that the hotel was a terrible place, and I dared not stay there any longer. I was very resentful in my heart that I had come to the wrong place. So I sat in a corner without saying a word, and he gently persuaded me to go for a walk. I don't know how long after, I found myself sitting on a small boat, circling the Lake Heart Pavilion, moving back and forth, which seemed to make me dizzy and very comfortable.</p>
<p>That night, I couldn't sleep, because I had never opened a hotel with a man before. I felt like I had committed a crime and felt uncomfortable. I wanted to go back to Shanghai, but I was afraid that I would not be able to catch the train to Nanjing. Stay another night? This night was too difficult for me, and I didn't trust him; although we were staying in different rooms.</p>
<p>Melancholy filled my heart, maybe he was the opposite of me! For dinner, he excitedly drank some wine. I found that his eyes were already emitting an unusual gleam. His unceasing gaze was slanting on my body. He didn't say anything. The air in the room was serious and terrible at this moment. This silence made me tremble. My pure and peaceful soul was startled by him. He really pounced on me and said: "Sister, my heart is burning! You should promise...?" He hugged me tightly and wanted to try to kiss me! Fortunately, the waiter came in at the right time.</p>
<p>Because I was too uncomfortable, I didn't go back to my aunt's place, but took a small car straight home.</p>
<p>"What's going on, why is the house so quiet? Did everyone go out?" I asked the little maid, but she didn't answer. My younger sisters and brothers ran out to look at me and ran back in, which made me panic. I had to bravely step in front of my father's bed. His tiger-like eyes were staring at me and said, "Why are you back?" My mother was tearful and held a letter to show me. It turned out that there were such treacherous men in the world! He wrote a letter telling my father that I had fallen in love with him and had stayed with him in a hotel in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Forget it, it doesn't count as me being fooled. I packed a few clothes and ran back to Shanghai to find a life for myself elsewhere.</p>

<h3>One Family's Life</h3>
<p>Answer: After reading this letter, the editor has two thoughts. First, the gentry's authority in our society is so sought after, the gentry can be considered a "profession," and the gentry can do evil. Second, Mr. Chen feels in his heart that his father should be "eliminated," but on the one hand, he is also glad that his father was able to "get some money" so that he could "enter school to study from a young age," and he praises him for being able to "benefit (?) society—the lives of more than ten people in the family depend on his support." In order to maintain his personal and family life, he wants to prevent and avoid the maid's mother from accusing his father, hoping that his father's sins will be reduced, and he can no longer act according to his conscience. Therefore, while the editor admires Mr. Chen's frankness and sincerity, and forgives his difficulties, he also feels the greatness of the power of the living environment in determining people's actions.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is afraid that once his father is accused by the maid's mother, he will not escape the law. In fact, this is entirely the fantasy of a young man with a pure heart who has not seen much of the world, and it is an unnecessary fear. No wonder your father will not listen to your advice. Why? Mr. Chen's father is a "gentleman" who can support a family of more than ten people by relying on the "gentleman" profession, then the "authority" and "usefulness" of the "gentleman" can also be clearly seen. Therefore, his old man "taking a maid as a concubine" is something he can do in his position. Conversely, if he does not dare or cannot "take a maid as a concubine," or cannot "actually commit the crime of adultery with a young girl," then he is simply not qualified to be a gentleman. Readers and Mr. Chen, seeing the editor's argument, will definitely find it too extreme and will immediately ask: "That's right: the gentry has power, but why does the maid's mother still dare to make a fuss? Why doesn't Mr. Chen's father use his gentry power to suppress her?" Then the editor can answer him like this: the situation the editor is talking about originally refers to the general situation in reality, and exceptions are of course inevitable, so this cannot be observed mechanically. However, even in Mr. Chen's situation, according to the editor's speculation, the reason why the maid's mother is so arrogant is not that Mr. Chen's father has no power, or that he is muddleheaded and perfunctory. The biggest reason is that Mr. Chen's father is infatuated with the maid, and at the same time has ill feelings towards your old mother. Therefore, the maid's mother dares to be so bold and dares to make "outrageous" demands. Mr. Chen, look, if your father is no longer confused by the maid's mother in the future, will her mother dare to make such a fuss—Mr. Chen didn't say that his father is somewhat intelligent and capable, and has also worked as a teacher and a politician, so how could he be so confused that he doesn't even understand this little bit of legal knowledge? So, the reason why he dares to be so bold and reckless is that he has something to rely on and has no fear. Isn't the maid now subdued under "his lewd power"? If her mother really dares to oppose your father, why doesn't she sue him now, but comes to make a mess with your mother and others? From this point of view, even if her mother is extremely greedy and fierce, she can't do anything to your father. However, people get desperate and will do anything. In the future, she may sue your father, but you don't need to worry too much about this. If your father's gentry title remains the same, it will be nothing more than spending a little more money to settle the matter. "Crime" and "jail" are definitely out of the question; you can rest assured.</p>
<p>Therefore, what you should study is "what attitude your mother, brothers, wives, etc. should take towards her." Other than that, nothing else becomes a problem. You want to prevent her from making trouble again in the future, which is not successful, and it also commits the fault of "only seeing yourself and not caring about others." Your father ruined someone else's daughter, forcing her to submit under his lewd power, and raping her. This kind of inhumane behavior is probably something even robbers would not do, but in fact, it comes from the hands of noble and graceful gentry. Moreover, people are used to it and are not surprised by this kind of incident at all. On the contrary, they are very surprised, blame, and hate the maid's mother's noise, doing everything possible. The social situation is like this, it is truly lamentable! Mr. Chen's heart is very frank, but because his own interests are too important, he did not say a fair word for her mother, but instead has some resentment. This kind of intention is certainly not a crime for Mr. Chen, but we do not want Mr. Chen to continue to hold this attitude. Other people's daughters are raped by your father, but they should not speak up. You are insulted by her, so you should complain. How can there be such a reason in the world—therefore, the editor regards the maid's mother's resistance as extremely justified, no matter what means she takes. However, the editor believes that her opposition to you is a barbaric act and does not understand the situation, because it is your father who harmed her. She should negotiate with him and come to quarrel with you. It is not only bullying the weak and fearing the strong, but also punishing the innocent. Therefore, the editor believes that Mr. Chen should not speak purely from a personal standpoint, and should not avoid her mother's noise. Instead, he should help her desperately make a big fuss with his father, which is the right thing to do. If Mr. Chen and your mother can take this attitude, it will be beneficial to both people and oneself, and the dispute can be resolved as a result. Otherwise, unless you use a method to suppress her mother so that she does not dare to speak up and submits to your lewd power, there is no way to avoid her making trouble.</p>
<p>The central meaning of Mr. Chen's letter is the problem of life. Therefore, the editor is not at all anxious about what Mr. Chen is extremely anxious about; but on the other hand, the editor is extremely anxious about what Mr. Chen is not very anxious about. There were originally three stores in Mr. Chen's family. Because of the bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of commerce in recent years, the larger one in the city "closed down during the end of last year!" This should be a very terrible thing! If the economic crisis deepens day by day in the future, and Mr. Chen's stores cannot maintain even one, then even if the maid's mother does not accuse your father of his crimes (in fact, even if she accuses him, and he is fairly punished according to the current law, it will not bankrupt your family), bankruptcy is still inevitable. In fact, according to the editor's shallow economic knowledge, our country's economic crisis will definitely deepen day by day. Imperialist aggression is intensifying day by day, and Mr. Chen's father and others still have to rely on the gentry profession for a living. How can this prevent the countryside from becoming increasingly bankrupt and commerce from declining day by day! The income of Mr. Chen's family has probably decreased compared to before in recent years, but your father still has to "take a maid as a concubine" and spend more money. Therefore, on the one hand, the source of income is less, and on the other hand, more flows out. In this way, even if the remaining two stores do not close down, if the business is not good, then the economy of your family will definitely be very tight. If the harvest of your family's fields at this time is not as good as in previous years, then under the current situation of dumping of foreign rice and cheap grain hurting farmers, your family's economy will accelerate to bankruptcy. In the process of the collapse of the rural economy, the lives of people with land will become a problem, and those landless tenant farmers and hired laborers will be reduced to hunger and cold. When they have no way to go, they will definitely take risks at all costs. At that time, can your father's "gentry profession life" not be shaken? Wouldn't the lives of more than ten people in your family still be without security? However, this is impossible to save.</p>
<p>After Mr. Chen hears the editor's above passage, he should not be too afraid and feel the danger of his own decline. It should be known that fear is useless, and fear cannot avoid the coming of danger. Only by recognizing the nature of the danger and studying how individuals can avoid being harmed by the danger is the only way to avoid danger. Editor</p>

<h3>Lulu's Victory (10) (1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jingxin, written by M. Saggio, Italy</p>
<p>"I am willing to wait," Lulu replied, "I need to know Robert better."</p>
<p>In fact, this daughter was observing, she ran around like usual, singing, laughing, and playing mischievously like usual, but she often interrupted these happy behaviors and pondered over her sister. I was carefully listening to every word of Robert's. Her sister often pressed her lips, tightened her eyebrows, and showed a very attentive expression.</p>
<p>Therefore, Lulu looked at her; and strange things happened to her. Robert was also not as calm and happy as before, but rather thoughtful, pale, and excited. He spoke absentmindedly and simply; the things that were very interesting to him before now seemed indifferent; sometimes it took a lot of effort for him to restrain himself and become like before, but only for a very short time. He was not used to pretending, and he did not do it well; his desires and inner pain were displayed in his eyes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sophia also showed a different appearance; Sophia, who was always nervous and restless, would sometimes embrace her sister enthusiastically, and sometimes would not look at her for several hours, hiding from her. A dark red tide, a fiery red tide, appeared on her cheeks; a flame burned in her eyes; her voice was now heavy and full of emotion, hoarse and grating; her hands trembled. She did not sleep at night. Lulu often got up at night, walked barefoot to her door and listened quietly, and heard Sophia tossing and turning in bed and crying. If asked, Sophia would claim that there was no such thing; she always answered the same way. When Sophia and Robert met—which happened every day—the changes that took place in both of them were even more obvious. They spoke very little, answered too abruptly and vaguely, and often had strange glances; often they did not talk all night, but everyone was carefully studying each other's every move. They never sat together; but Robert always found an excuse to pick up the needlework and books that Sophia had touched. Sometimes when she was not in the house, Robert became more and more uneasy, staring at the closed door, answering people's questions absentmindedly. Sometimes Sophia had only been there for five minutes when he picked up his hat and said goodbye. This daughter became pale, with two dark circles under her eyes. Finally, she decided not to let people see her. For about a week, she locked herself in the house every night, trembling intolerably, trying to suppress her unhappiness.</p>
