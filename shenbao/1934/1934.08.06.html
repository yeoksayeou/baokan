<p>時評</p>
<h3>奬勵華僑回國投資的三個要點廷</h3>
<p>凡在海外居留稍久的人。往往發現在一個人跡罕到的窮鄕僻野中。亦有做小本營生的華僑。他們也許離開了中國數十年。對於故鄕的消息。亦隔膜得很。可是一點國家觀念。依然藴藏在心坎中。隨時會流露出來。你如撣着鄕白和他打招呼。他便會敬茶敬烟。很親熱的同你談話。談話的當兒。說不定會表示自已年老。要趕快趁身子硬朗的時候。走回老家去。不要一輩子流落海外。作爲異鄕之鬼。</p>
<p>越是頭腦簡單的華僑。越是自負爲中國人。誣攀他是日本人時。便會和你過不去。何以華僑的國家觀念特别來得深刻呢。大概一方面是因爲看着居留國的興旺發達。覺得自已的國家太不像話。恨不得立刻和人家「並駕齊驅」去。一方面是因爲身受居留國的苛例虐待。没有强硬的政府作靠山。處處忍氣吞聲。希望有一天也給人家當做一個人看待。</p>
<p>中山先生說。「華僑是革命之母。」其實除了革命事業以外。華僑對於祖國的慈善事業所盡的力量。亦眞不少。我們敢說。中國有負於華僑。華僑决無負於中國。</p>
<p>贊助革命事業和慈善事業所得的代價。最多不過是種精神上的安慰。而各地華僑「踴躍輸將」的熱忱。尚且如此。何况是名利兼收的投資事業呢。他們豈不格外熱心嗎。</p>
<p>可是話兒要說轉來了。過去假借開辦工廠。經營實業等名義。而向僑界招摇撞騙的敗類。眞不知有多少。受騙的華僑。將汗血金錢平白犧牲了。而只博得一個「亞丁」或寃桶的雅號。那得不心灰意懶的呢。所以我們不能把握住華僑的信用。而貿然要求他們回國投資。結果不能良好。只可埋怨自已。這是第一點。</p>
<p>國内吏治未清。盜匪充斥。苛雜盛行。農村破産。以致内地流資集中於少數的通都大邑。釀成都市「充血」鄕村「貧血」的病態現象。情形如此。我們希望華僑投資。投到那裏去呢。投到都市去罷。實在没有需要。何必多此一舉。投到鄕村去罷。又不免敎他們去做「亞丁。」問心亦所不忍。我們記得今年二月間。越南華僑曾經呈訴中央。說該地華僑。因受居留政府的重稅壓迫。不能維持營業。有幾個人乃實行回國投資。另謀生計。不料又受本鄕貪官污吏的勒索。把他們置買的土地。報作官産佔去。使其進退皆無生路。此外還可隨便舉幾個例子出來。如雪蘭峨華僑。組織亞洲考察團。考察祖國的文化交通和實業。以備報告該地僑胞。投資國内。而其四個團員中就有一個。在江西遇匪受傷。又如仰光歸國華僑曾上苑。積資甚富。在三月十七日夜由厦門到鼓浪嶼中途。亦被賊匪綁去。像這樣的消息。傳入僑胞的耳朶中去。那有不痛心不吃驚之理。希望人家投資。當然要使資本安全。否則便根本無從談起。這是第二點。</p>
<p>據僑務委員會統計。各國政府虐待華僑的苛例。截止去年止。共達一百十三種。其中有的在剥削華僑的居留出入和旅行的自由。有的則在限制華僑營業置産婚媾敎育等等的權利有當今不景氣的關頭。加上了這許多重的桎梏。華僑處境的困難。亦就可想而知了。華僑用了超量的汗血去賺錢。究竟不是天天可以生金蛋的神鵝。我們希望他們到國内來投資。至少亦得出力把他們的苛例廢除了幾個。把他的經濟能力培養了幾分。廢除苛例。應該由外交折衝去着手。培養經濟能力。應該向國貨推銷方面去注意。我們要盡力使華僑爲推銷國貨的商人。要盡力給他們以自由發展的便利。做到了這兩件事。華僑的經濟能力才能相當的復興。亦才可有錢向國内來投資。這是第三點。</p>
<p>最近僑務委員會。對於勸導僑胞回國投資一事。很在熱烈提倡。而行政院亦早經通令各省市府切實保護回國投資的華僑。只要政府有誠意。有能力。富於愛國心的華僑。總不會使我們失望。我們願把上述的三個要點指出來。希望政府當局注意。</p>

<h3>德意志政變一瞥德國通信</h3>
<p>國社黨内部分裂</p>
<p>衝鋒隊形同解散</p>
<p>希特勒黨統制底下的德國、本有許多矛盾、這些矛盾、第一是國社黨内部的不統一、第二是金融資本家與中層分子的不調和、原來希特勒内閣成立的時候、裏面非國社黨黨員、就占着相當的數目、如副總理巴本·如外長牛拉得·如財長克洛奇克·都不是國社黨員、因爲國社黨急進派要徹底實行其政綱、所以就和保守派發生衝突、於是纔有六月十七日巴本在馬堡大學的不平講演、要求合理的自由、但是事實上、似與國社黨内訌、好像没有十分大關係的、</p>
<p>事變的發生、是在六月三十日午後三時十五分伯林的國家警察隊、突然出動、占領了國社黨衝鋒隊隊本部、和國社黨的參謀本部、伯林市中立刻入於戒嚴狀態、很多的國社黨幹部、都被逮捕、放在監獄裏、衝鋒隊總司令勒姆·在穆亨被捕、布蘭丁堡衝鋒隊隊長愛倫斯脫·在布内門被捕、並卽行付軍法審判、其他還有西勒西亞地方黨部部長·穆亨區衝鋒隊長、穆亨區衝鋒隊分隊長、波墨拉尼亞區衝鋒隊長、穆亨區衝鋒隊副分隊長、薩克森區衝鋒隊長·等六名、由衝鋒隊隊本部、宣告他們死刑、並於今日執行槍决、並且在爭鬥的時候、把前内閣總理施萊徹將軍夫婦、也打死了、其餘被捕的人、確數雖不可知、而大體上的數目、總有好幾百、更在國境綫上張布警戒網、凡是通過國境的汽車·火車·行人·都須受嚴重的檢查、纔能過去、事態的嚴重、是德國近年來少有的、事變發生後、希特勒卽任命魯兹爲衝鋒隊新總司令、對於幹部也有很大的更動這也可以看出其内部的動摇經過的事實、據記者所知、大體如此、同時因爲他們封銷消息的關係、有許多事情還不甚清楚、至於爲什麽會發生這次事變、簡單的講起來、是國社黨内急進派和保守派的衝突、急進派可推宣傳部長哥伯爾斯爲領袖、保守派是以副總理巴本爲首、在五月初頭、哥氏就把那對國社黨政綱政策不滿的人呌作反動派主張將他們肅清出去、並且要他屬下的希特拉青年團·與保守派的鋼盔團·爭鬥、要解散鋼盔團、與急進派對抗的背後、有舊時代的貴族·官吏·軍人·等、所以巴本纔發爲不平的演詞、這篇演講、經宣傳扣留着、没有發表、然而這尚是表面理由之一、内容還不如此簡單</p>
<p>大家都曉得希特勒在實際上、羣衆擁護他的是中層分子、卽所謂白領頭階級、因爲他抓着了中層分子、所以他左邊打倒了共産黨、右邊壓服了中央派、和社會民主黨、同時希特勒又明白光有中層分子、祗是羣衆方面的利用、欲於實際上的政治鬥爭、非與大金融資本奇生一派聯合不可、於是他又暗中與金融資本携手、及至希特勒登台、中小工商業者爲主力的中層分子、除了中産階級獨裁、高倡國家高於一切的空名外、一無可得、而金融資本家、則假統制濟之名、把産業·金融·都抓到手裏、所以財政·外交·經濟·等重要閣員、都是他們的、希特勒祗得到維持治安的全國警察、在這種情形之下、國社黨所定的網領、希氏對中層分子所預約的條件、一件也没有實行、因此由小商人·職員·職工·所組成的衝鋒隊（Ｓ·Ｓ·）、就和軍人·舊官僚·貴族·子弟·智識分子·等所組織警衛隊（ＳＶ·）相對立起來、互相輕蔑、互相嫉姑、現在事變雖然暫時告一段落、清黨運動、算是成了功、但究竟是暫時的事、恐怕事變的序幕、還有更厲害更複雜的變幻、在將來呢、（七月一日於伯林）</p>

<p>王志聖包華國</p>
<h3>談考察感想</h3>
<p>歐洲工業衰落</p>
<p>日貨到處傾銷</p>
<p>出席國際勞工大會之各代表、自前日歸國抵滬後、本市中華工業總聯合會等各工商團體、特聯合公宴、政府代表李平衡、已於昨晚返京、日日社記者昨日特訪資方代表王志聖、承告歐洲各國工業之狀况、兹誌如下、</p>
<h3>各國僱主同一見解</h3>
<p>據王氏談、此次勞工大會所提出之節目、有關於中國者甚少、惟於每星期四十小時之工作一節、中國僱主方面、因事業衰落、難以再加負擔、故於僱主團中曾撰就一節略、聲明立塲、及現在之狀况下、於施行時間上、尚未能容許、嗣各國僱主、亦同此見解、遂將提案保留、待下屆大會再提討論、</p>
<h3>歐洲工業衰落殆遍</h3>
<p>至歐洲各國到處現不景氣現象、一切均在收縮、尤其是英國、蘭開夏之綿紡業、所有出品、幾皆無地可銷、經濟更形竭蹶、此外於歐州各處海岸、所有輪船噸數、擱而無用者、少則二十萬噸、多則百餘萬噸、揆諸原因、是在關稅高築、金融不能流通、同時軍費所用過多、於人民之地位、實屬不能負担、有以致此、</p>
<h3>錢承緒赴各國考察</h3>
<p>記者旋詢錢承緒君之行踪據答、於大會閉幕後、錢君曾去意大利·捷克·德國·調查飛也脫汽車公司、拔佳製造公司、塞耳鑛務公司、西門子與蔡司鏡片兩公司、截至予等啟程回國之日、尚在柏林、應柏林及來必塞克等大學之邀、講論工業經濟、有函與予、定七月二十一日、由法國去英、轉道赴美、渠之調查報告、有大部分已陸續寄回、現正抄寫整理、編輯付印、全書至遲年内可以出版、</p>
<h3>包華國談歐洲日貨</h3>
<p>日日社記者、昨曾訪政府代表顧問包華國於中國飯店、據談、關於國勞大會之情形、已在李代表平衡之談話詳述、當無庸贅告、惟余輩出國數月、所歷各地、覩日貨遍佈、非唯我中華國貨未能揷足、卽歐美各國貨品之市塲、亦幾將爲日貨所侵佔、此實使吾人感觸之餘、而希國内工商、有亟須深自警惕、努力改進也、卽此次大會中、各國對日貨之傾銷、本有以限制之、惟因種種關係、未有决定、然亦可見各國工商深惡日貨之一班矣云云、</p>
<p>出席國勞代表</p>
<h3>安輔廷談各國勞工狀况</h3>
<p>勞工待遇較我優異</p>
<p>安全設備日益進步</p>
<p>丨草擬報告附陳三項建議丨</p>
<p>出席第十八屆國際勞工大會代表團、於前日上午、歸國抵滬後、政府代表李平衡·原定於昨晨卽行乘車晋京、向政府覆命、嗣以忙於各方酬酢、改於昨晚成行、勞方代表安輔廷、則定於今明日内晋京、向中央黨部復命、然後轉返華北、（按安氏爲唐山啟新洋灰公司工會常務理事、遠東社記者、昨特訪晤安代表於其旅次、據談歐洲各國勞工狀况等情甚詳、</p>
<h3>一般情形</h3>
<p>安氏首謂、本人等於出席大會之後、特趁便分赴各國考察、關於考察時所注意之點、本人與李司長（平衡）略有不同、李司長以站在政府立塲、側重於勞工行政、本人以站在工人立塲、側重於勞工生活、就一般情形上講、歐洲任何國家、其勞工待遇、均較我國爲優異、</p>
<h3>瑞士特點</h3>
<p>再各國均勵行實業保險、務使之普遍、米蘭爲意國之工業中心、各種工廠林立、各廠均有工人消費合作社之組織、予工人以便利、在各國中、尤以瑞士之勞工待遇爲最優、其特點在除實業保險外、並另有一種社會保險、工人年老無力工作後、可坐享社會保險所得、以維生活、其工資平均每日三法郎、約合我三元之譜、比諸我國工資、每日平均僅四角之微、其懸殊如此、</p>
<h3>工作時間</h3>
<p>至於工作時間、各國均規定最多不過八小時、星期日當然休假、而我國竟有超出十小時者、且星期日、每多須照常工作、無怪工人呌苦、此次國勞大會、勞力並又提出、要求將每週工作四十八小時、减至四十小時、乃以一部份國家資方或政府代表之反對、未獲通過、留待六屆大會再議、</p>
<h3>安全設備</h3>
<p>安氏繼談、各國工廠、對於安全設備、均極講究、並以政府之厲行工廠檢查、更日益進步、我政府現亦注意及此、開始實施工廠檢查、此不特有惠工人、抑且有利於廠主、蓋工廠設備安全、則災害减少、豈非勞資兼利、</p>
<h3>工人年齡</h3>
<p>再若工人年齡、各國均有限制、大多規定最老不得過六十歲、最幼不得小於十五歲、因各國均厲行强迫敎育、十五歲以下、爲受强迫敎育期間、非如我國貧寒子弟、多因無受敎育機會、而反爲家長驅之作工、</p>
<h3>限制女工</h3>
<p>各國對於女工、每多有限制、且已形成一種自然趨勢、卽婦女多爲公司店員、旅館茶役、入工廠工作者、逐漸减少、德國之女工多爲已成齡而尚未結婚、其已結婚者、則居家處理家事、僅由其丈夫出外工作、</p>
<h3>三項建議</h3>
<p>安氏末稱、本人刻正在督同程顧問（海峯）等、草擬書面報告、俾携京向中央黨部復命、俟抵京後、卽可發表、其内容除詳陳大會經過、及考察所得外、並附陳三項建議、（一）希望政府迅予批准本屆大會决議各案、（計四十餘件）並逐步實施、（二）希望勞方努力生産、以助國家生機、（三）希望資方體諒工人困難、多予便利、實行眞正勞資合作云云、</p>

<p>人力車問題能否解决</p>
<h3>須視今晨會議</h3>
<p>車商擬具意見準備提出</p>
<p>各界對此會議均極重視</p>
<p>新新社云、公共租界人力車問題、以車委會與車商間之相互爲執、致形成對峙局面、本市市商會·納稅華人會·等團體以人力車關係界内交通及車夫生活頗鉅、曾迭次函請工部局、對新章加以注意、工部局總辦鍾思、爰於三日、召集車商談話、旋因雙方仍各持主見、致無結果而散、但鍾氏爲免風潮擴大起見、於會後特令同業公會、擬具最低限度修改新章意見、俾於六日上午十時會議時提出公開討論、兹悉公會方面、已擬就意見七項、準備提出、屆時參加該會者、除工部局總辦鍾思外、車委會主席麥西·華委虞洽卿·車商代表殷芝齡·等均將與會、公共租界人力車問題之糾紛、能否於最短期内解决、全視六日會議有無結果而斷、故各界對此次會議、頗爲重視云、</p>
<p>駐瑞公使</p>
<h3>胡世澤昨晋京</h3>
<p>晋謁汪兼外長請示一切</p>
<p>本月九日由　赴歐回任</p>
<p>我國駐瑞公使胡世澤、因辦理父喪、於七月上旬、偕駐法公使顧維鈞等由歐返國、并向中央報告歐洲情形、迄已匝月、胡氏兹以外部電促早日返任、爰於昨晚十一時、由滬乘搭夜快車入京、晋謁汪兼外長請示一切、在京勾留一二日、卽行返滬、準定本月九日、由滬乘搭意郵船康脫凡第號、赴歐回任、</p>
<h3>李擇一東渡</h3>
<p>兩星期卽返滬</p>
<p>日日社云、閩省府顧問李擇一、日前奉閩主席陳儀電召回閩、旋於本月一日由閩來滬、兩行裝甫卸、又怱怱於四日晨八時許、乘長崎丸東渡、前赴東京、李氏瀕行語記者云、此行毫無任務、純屬料理私事而已、兩星期内卽可返滬云云、</p>
<p>顧馨一談</p>
<h3>購西貢米經過</h3>
<p>内地存米尚多米商操縱居奇</p>
<p>日俄形勢險惡麫商屯集漲價</p>
<p>大白社云、今年以天氣亢旱、米價飛漲、各有關團體、曾有倡議訂購洋米、以濟將來災荒者、亦有反對訂購、認爲足可維持者、意見紛紜、莫衷一是、大白社記者爲明瞭眞象起見、昨特往訪米業界鉅子顧馨一、承答甚詳、誌之如下、</p>
<p>訂購西米眞象據談、本埠日前確有大批西貢米到滬、雖非地方恊會所訂購、惟確爲該會服務於銀行界之會員所接洽、亦無失爲抑平米價、調劑民食、惟以日來天時酷熱、雨量仍少、此項洋米、確有訂購之必要、今西貢米到滬者、有一萬二千包、第二次運來者、亦有一萬包之譜、如災情仍不見减、以後將陸續運到、至到滬之西米、銷去者已有半數、西貢米輸出時、假定爲七元二角、外加稅費三元五角、共十元七角、加以報關及起脚等費、總在十一元以上、今滬地米商出售價格、亦以十一元爲準、故全爲義務性質、無利可沾、</p>
<p>内地存米情形今據調查所得、内地存米尚多、預計本年度、不致陷於無米之境、今各地之米荒、實由於少數米商操縱所致、今欲抑平米價、除訂購洋米外、别無他法、至今年各地秋收情形、以蕪湖最佳、江西湖南亦可無虞、惟亦祗能顧及其毘鄰省分、至其他地方、若再無兩、低田固可收到省許、高田則恐無稻可收、難免不發生米荒也、</p>
<p>麥麫漲價原因至小麥及麫粉價格、近亦隨各地米價而飛漲、其原因頗爲複雜、但不外麫麥之生産地、大都近東北、自僞組織成立、大事收買、致麥價亦形高漲、天時不佳、農居居奇、皆爲重要之原因、且國際風雲、日趨緊張、日俄間時有發生戰爭之可能、故多數麥商、收買屯集、以備戰時高價出售、至各界盛傳日人將收買大批麥子說、則全屬子虚、至麥價之上升、恐暫無下轉勢云、</p>
<p>招商局與平漢路</p>
<h3>定期實行聯運</h3>
<p>大公社云、國營招商局、與平漢鐵路聯運、改定於本月十五日起實行、漢口水陸聯運交接站之躉船、積極進行裝置、並測量江底水道、兹將各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>測量躉站平漢路之水陸聯運、原定五月間實行、因定造之聯運躉船一艘、由滬拖往漢口裝置時、中途擱淺、頗有毁損、重行修理、現已運到漢口江面裝置、招商局以此站水陸運輸、最爲重要、恐水汛低落時、儎重輸船、不能靠卸、深恐有堅質之沙石等毁損船底、故總經理劉鴻生、特商請海軍部海道測量局、進行測量、並挖深江底、以免將來發生影響、</p>
<p>聯運實行招商局與平漢路辦理水陸聯運之一切手續、均已完備、貨物聯運之各水陸站票價、屬於陸路者、由平漢鐵路規定、屬於水路者、由招商局規定、業經雙方交換、於本月十五日實行、聯運期之前一日公布之、辦理聯運之職員、漢口分局前遣派兩人來滬實習、業已返漢、滬總局以平漢路初辦理聯運時、貨物與手續方面必然繁雜、日内由聯運股主任周鳳圖赴漢、臨時主持一切云、</p>
<p>續辦計劃照招商局與全國鐵路實行聯運之計劃、計分十一大幹綫、已實行者、祇有隴海膠濟兩路、八月十五日、平漢路聯運實行後、卽進行津浦路、據招商局營業科聯運股主任周鳳圖語大公社記者、今後局方續辦之計劃、以京滬杭甬兩路等七大路綫進行、預定本年内或遲至明年二三月間、可實現全國聯運計劃云、</p>
<h3>雅王公昨由京返滬</h3>
<p>日内擬赴閩一行</p>
<p>中央社云、青海第二十九旗右翼輔國公雅楞丕勒、奉命考察全國工商業抵滬後、卽於日前入京、晋謁蒙藏委員會當局、會商關於敦勸各界向青海投資事宜、業於昨晨返滬、并定於日内赴閩一行、然後再返省復命、據雅王公談、青海苛捐雜稅重疊、民生凋敝、希望當局、加以注意廢除、至於二十九旗之旗印、將由國府另鑄新印頒給、蓋現用之旗印、尚係清政府時所發給云、</p>
<h3>整頓長蘆鹽務辦法</h3>
<p>范長泰呈蔣建議</p>
<p>新聲社云、長蘆爲我國最大鹽區、近年來受華北政局影響、緝務廢弛、致稅收大减、前緝私大隊長范長泰少將、特就經騐所知、建議整頓辦法、呈請蔣委員長採擇施行、兹分誌原文如下、</p>
<p>呈蔣委員長文呈爲建議整頓長蘆鹽務、嚴辦緝私、每年可多增收千萬元、藉紓國家財困、仰祈鑒核事、竊查長蘆全區、每年銷引、原定比額、爲四百萬擔、全年收入二千萬元左右、現在長蘆緝務廢弛、海私·硝私·鄰私·灘私·爲數當在二分之一以上、影響國家稅收、至重且鉅、推源其故、厥在緝私組織渙散、曁用人不當二端、若欲刷新整頓、似宜遴選幹員、總攬緝政、以專責成、而用人行政、亦宜力求公開、一以人才爲重、優隆待遇、賞罰分明、務使稅警官兵、心悅誠服、克盡厥職而後已、鹽務緝私前途、必有清明之日、用以嚴勦梟匪、收入必當起色、伏思值兹國庫艱窘之日、而勦共戡亂、尤急待需欵之秋、流無可節、源在必開、但簡捷易辦、則莫如整頓長蘆之鹽務、及嚴辦緝私爲得策、長泰側身長蘆、歷有年所、個中底藴、深爲詳悉、目睹時艱、豈容坐視、爰於去歲十二月間、擬具整頓長蘆務緝私建議書、呈達鈞座、旋於本年一月四日、奉鈞座南昌行營治字第一七六七號批示、呈件均悉、旣據分呈、仰靜候主管機關核示可也、於本年二月九日、又奉鹽務署戍字第一三號批示、奉部交來呈曁附件均悉、核閱建議書内所陳整頓長蘆鹽務緝私各節、不爲無見、存備參考可也、但至今未見施行、故長蘆自曾仰豐代理運使蒞任以來、私鹽充斥、稅欵不能多增、每月總减收三四十萬元之譜、兹不揣議陋、復另擬具建議書一份、掬誠貢獻、以報國家裁植之恩於萬一、倘蒙採擇、庶於國家財政、裨益良多、爲此呈請鑒核採擇、轉飭施行、以舒中央財困、不勝盼禱之至、</p>
<p>整頓鹽務辦法（一）整頓長蘆緝務、每年可多增收千萬元之定例、華北軍政各費、向以長蘆收入爲大宗的欵、惜緝務廢弛、致近來照比額、收入銳减、查長蘆引岸比額、年爲三百八十三萬担、而近年來、銷數僅在三分之二、蓋因沿海晒私約占十分之二、各地硝私約占十分之三、鄰私約占十分之一、灘私約占十分之一、是年少銷官引亦近三百餘萬担、國家此項損失、殊非淺鮮、倘將長蘆鹽務、及緝私澈底整頓、每年當定可多增收千萬元也、（二）嚴整緝私之組織、現在長蘆緝私隊、已改稱稅警、不辦緝務、徒講軍隊内務工作、兼組織渙散、互相不能聯絡、以長蘆偌大區域、僅有兵力二千餘名、已嫌單薄、若再不能聯絡嚴密、殊不易奏緝私之功也、（三）對於梟匪須嚴厲勦滅、長蘆區域之梟匪、刁頑異常、與兩淮大不相同、人民之習慣亦異、此次由兩淮調往長蘆之少數稅警官長、雖熟悉鹽務、而地方情形隔膜、故緝務不能收效也、而長蘆之鹽匪、每有百十成羣、持槍持械、販運私鹽、稅警隊兵、人數太少、往往不克取勝、甚或受匪徒之侮辱、卽一般村民、亦深知隊兵單薄、上峯又不肯積極負責、故聚衆格鬥、持械拒捕、均司空見憤、若無勇敢負責之長官、統率相當之兵力、嚴厲痛勦、亦難收顯著之效果也、（四）對於灤東戰區曁大名一帶硝鹽區之辦法、灤河東西淪爲戰區之後、海私遼私充斥、大名一帶、紅槍會跋扈、致硝私充斥、此兩地帶、皆因情形非常、勢須遴選人地相宜善辦緝務之非常幹員、充任稅警官長、方能措置裕如也、（五）對於灘沱之保護、長蘆産鹽區、僅塘沽·鄧沽·新河·漢沽·四大灘、區域較小、置稅警六百名、卽可保護周密、而現在曾代運使計劃整理長蘆方案内、預於灘外廓築汽車路、内掘濠溝及運河、加徵特稅計二年完成等等、得空耗五六十萬元之鉅欵、於緝務曁稅收、毫無補益、如有此鉅欵、足可添招稅警騎兵巡緝隊千名、以文武兼全深明長蘆緝政之幹員統帶之、對於全區梟匪、負責嚴爲痛勦、在一年之内、私鹽定可絶跡、稅收不但不能减少、每年定可多增收千萬元也、至一年之後、逐漸裁减步兵、以符原預算、以上五項、僅擇要而言、倘蒙採擇轉飭施行、其他詳細各辦法、再爲另呈、</p>
<h3>私烟緝捕會今日成立</h3>
<p>國聞社云、本埠捲烟業務委員會、前曾推派華英各廠家負責人組織捲烟緝捕恊助委員會、計南洋勞敬修·華成陳茂楠·華東黎學東·大東孫山立·利興包賡笙·萃衆沈維挺·英美沈崑山·等七人、原擬於三日舉行成立大會、嗣因時間忽促、故改於今日下午三時、假財政部稅務署舉行、稅務署方面、亦將有五人參加、俟成立後、即開始進行工作、並將請立法當局、關於私造捲烟之商人、訂一特别處罰條例、俾被捕後、將依法處理之、</p>

<p>展期開幕據談、該國展會、原與本會約定爲上月二十五日開幕、後因入夏以來、亢旱不雨、會塲建築、因當地河水乾涸、運料不及、致不能如期竣工、故該國展會開幕日期、直展至八月一日、方始舉行、是日（開幕日）假伯先公園公共演講廳爲禮堂、雖火傘高撑、烈炎烘人、而是日所到各機關代表與來賓、竟達三千餘人、當由省府主席陳果夫、主持揭幕、實部代表沈伯先氏舉行升旗、並有中央與蘇省黨部及各廳處機關代表相繼致詞演說、語都勗勉、此外尚有保安處及省公安局、派有軍警及樂隊到塲、維持秩序、儀節極莊嚴而隆重、</p>

<h3>何謂國際問題（續）</h3>
<p>丨答顧千里君</p>
<p>在過去人類的腦裏，世界的觀念是一個抽象的廣大無邊的東西。許多怪誕的傳說告訴了我們人類對世界認識的過程。但是幾千年的人類的經騐；尤其是這二三百年來人類非凡的努力的結果，完全推翻了舊日的觀念。他們知道地球雖比人的個體大到無限，如果與那茫漠無涯的宇宙比較起來，地球不過是一顆小石子。同時因爲人類克服自然的程度比昔日躍進了一大步，在人類的腦裏，地球也縮小了。以前人類的活動被這舞台的裝置所限制，自已只好屈伏在自然之前，現在因爲科學的進步，經濟的發達，一切天然的障礙幾乎全被撤去了。從前旅行的成羣結隊的駱駝，摇擺進行的地方，現在大半代以鐵路火車了。從前認爲不可飛渡的海洋，現在浮着玩具似的汽船，兵輪了，從前驚嘆不可逾越的關山，現在有蜻蜒似的飛船飛機翩翩而過了。其他文明利器的可驚的進步，改造了今日的世界。現在我們駕駛飛機可以在一週間從地球的這面，飛到地球的那一面去，若自已不想行動，你儘可以足不出户，　在安適的沙發上，用無綫電報，無綫電話與世界各地的朋友通話傾談，你還可用傳眞機親自得覩萬里外你的意中人的顔色憨笑。實際上地球是改變了，一千里被縮上爲一里了。</p>
<p>自然這是（恒河沙數）次世界變化的結果，現在仍在不斷的變化中。總之，這臺面的裝置現在是任憑演員先生們要怎樣就怎樣的。自然再不敢向人類頑皮了。這熱閙的臺面，今後是一天天要演出更新奇的喜劇的啊！</p>
<p>（二）戲劇與人物</p>
<p>對於過去人類的悲喜劇，我不想在此地多說，因爲這應歸歷史先生說的，我不想再來背誦戲考。現在就來談人類自發生國家後，人類所扮演的拿手好戲罷！不！這樣來談還要背誦幾千年的歷史啊！我們在追溯這段歷史以前，先交代目前止在扮演的戲劇罷！現在世界獨立國家有五十九個，但在這五十九位明星中，像胡蝶，徐來這樣出色的人物就不上十個。他們現在是這舞臺的臺柱，耀武揚威的在做戲。你要了解當前的戲劇麽？這眞複雜得會令你想像不到。就是這本書也祗能提出一點戲考的研究的途徑，還不能作全面的解說啊！可是話雖如此，這齣名劇的劇名是可首先交代的，它呌做是國際問題。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>脚底下，有一條厚約兩寸左右的地氈，舖遍了這一座小朝廷的全部；它的質料是天鵝絨，它的頻色是淺藍，這樣已是很够美麗的了，何况上而還有一簇簇的金色的圖案書堆砌着，都是些牡丹花和鳥中的鳳凰，的確可以稱贊它一聲「金碧輝煌。」</p>
<p>這一間屋子裏的窗洞，却並不像太后那間寢室裏的窗一樣的闊，大約是三與二之比。這些窗的所以較前者爲獗，乃是故意造成的。那麽爲什麽要故意這樣造呢？說來也是很可笑的：因爲太后有一種極濃烈的嗜好，便是歡喜玩弄伊自已所有的一切珍寶；當伊决定要上奉天去的時候，同時，伊就想到要把一部份的珠寶古玩，帶上火車來。伊雖然並不曾把這個意思明白告訴我，或慶善，或李蓮英，但我們根據伊平日的嗜好而推測，大家都早就明白了。於是便由慶善在監修專備太后乘坐的那一輛火車的當兒，定下了一個計劃，就是把車窗開得小一些，使中間都留一些空隙，就在這些空隙上，加釘了許多式樣各不相同的小架子，準備給太后安放那些珍寶。這一項設計居然大爲太后所稱賞，在伊没有上車之前，就忙着敎人把那些珍寶儘先安放上去，待到上車之後，伊越發生左顧右盼的看得出神了倒像是伊自已從前並不曾看見過的一樣。</p>
<p>窗雖然是比較的狹一些，可是上面所掛的簾幔，却尤比那小小的寢宫裏所用的來得考究。幔的本身還是一般的用不繡花的黃緞製的，但下面又多了一排用金綫做的短鬚，這樣便覺得格外的好看一些了。（九八）</p>
<h3>街頭圖書館</h3>
<p>— 孔皆</p>
<p>在上海幾乎每條街上可以看見一種小的書攤很整齊地放着許多連環圖畫的小書，化了幾個銅元便可租得幾本書，所以可名之曰：街頭圖書館，八劍十六俠，仙山奇俠，小熱昏之類的書便可代表了整個圖書館的書目。車夫，大姐，傭人以至於人家的太太都是這種圖書館的顧客。其中借書最多的就是小孩子們，這種情形是不難察見的。</p>
<p>我以爲這類書對於小孩子是不宜的，而且是應該積極地禁止，因爲這種書所述的不是荒誕不經的鬼話就是淫穢不堪的胡言。這對於什麽都不知的孩子至少是給他們思想上一種摧殘。記得曾有許多起學徒等離家修道的事發生，而這種小書就是促成這種事的因素。</p>
<p>並且這種小書經過多人的傳閱、難免不有傳染病菌附著。小孩看過後，再用這帶有傳染病菌的手抓東西吃，或者傳着了病症。</p>
<p>所以我謹以極誠懇的態度向做父母的說一聲：最好是能買有益的書給孩子看，至於這種小書寗願小孩子没書看，讓他玩閙：别給他這種書看。</p>
<p>這是我一些小小的意見，各位做父母的以爲如何？</p>
<h3>外國太太</h3>
<p>— 田會翁</p>
<p>太太，凡是男子，總是需要的。而且對於自已的太太，不疼愛的是少數：不畏懼的，尤其是少數；這個原理，恐怕心理學大家也說不出所不然來。</p>
<p>雖然法國名小說家歌德派拉先生，說中國女人臉部的輪廓，大多數像塌餅」，圓渾渾地加上一個扁扁的算頭，很和「塌餅」一樣。在做了太太的時候，這個「塌餅」，不是像咱們飢餓的時候，「大餅」一樣的可愛嗎？</p>
<p>雖然，臉的下部，成了銳角，在男人瞧來，不是呌做「瓜子臉」嗎？橢圓形的輪廓，不是呌做「鵝蛋臉」嗎？至於像無錫大阿福的模型，有福相的太太，百分之九十九是這樣的，老爺那裏不喜歡，不疼愛，不怕懼呢。</p>
<p>咱所奇怪的，是幾位留學生家裏的外國太太。高高的鼻梁，黃黃的眼睛，特種的氣息，咱當初以爲黃狗見了黑狗，美如西施；花貓見了黑貓，麗如王嬙；大家都是同類，當然發生美感，發生戀愛。不料咱們留學生對於外國太太，也發生特别的美感；所以，不討本國太太，而討外國太太了。</p>
<p>咱的朋友的母親，是一位東洋太太，伊却十二分的愛咱們中國，丨當然尤愛伊的丈夫，伊的子女。一些兒没有摩登習氣；洗衣燒飯，非常勤儉。没事的時候，焚起了一罏香，口口聲聲唸「阿彌陀佛。」東洋太太，委實是個「良妻賢母咧。據說，討法國太太，美國太太，英國太太，比較難服侍了。伊們物質的享受，比較舒齊。要伊過大家庭的生活，畢竟辦不到的。有許多老兄討了外國太太回到中國來，非在政界上活動不可，要是當敎書匠的朋友，那裏養得活呢。所以，不討外國太太則已，高興討個外國太太，見識見識，也是「東洋貨」爲宜！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三十二回　聲色自娱將軍終日樂老少環泣戰士幾人回</p>
<p>眞是那話，人到何處不相逢。前年子冬天，不有一個大兵到我們家去告帮去了嗎？他不知怎麽着混到全家當衛隊了。他看到了我就對我說，要打聽消息，可以到傷兵醫院裏去問問。若是一營人都打散了，好的會到團部裏集合，受了傷的，總也會送到這醫院裏來治病。若是這兩處都找不着……。我想，那也没有什麽找不着吧？老人家是很可憐，就是這樣一句掃興的話都不肯說了出來。江氏也很知道他的意思，便道：你什麽時候去打聽呢？趙翁道：馬上就去。桂枝道：前天開的火，今天就有傷兵回來嗎？趙翁道：那不管了；我去先瞧瞧看。他口裏不曾把話說得乾凈，人已經走出去遠了。其實桂枝口裏如此說着，心裏可就巴不得趙翁早去早回，最好是回來報告消息，說是自强腿上中了一個子彈躺在醫院裏呢。所以他先是巴不得趙翁快去，去了之後，又急急的盼他回來。約莫有兩三小時之久，趙翁帶着愁容進來，桂枝還不曾問呢，他先摇着頭道：那些受傷的人，可憐得很，我想咱們自强，天菩薩保佑，不受傷也罷，這老頭兒說話，向來是不肯迷信的，怎麽今天也說出這樣迷信的話來？這裏面或者另有原故。於是向趙翁道：你這大年紀，遇事都得看開點才好。明天你别去讓我去瞧瞧罷。趙翁道：你是懷孕的人，那裏去得，路遠着呢。我想自强的師部裏在北平設下有辦事處，到那裏去問問，也許比問醫院裏去打聽强。你想，自强又没有受傷，他跑到醫院裏去作什麽？（四四九）</p>
<h3>忠孝子孫</h3>
<p>— 隱</p>
<p>書書與人之品性操行，關係至爲密切，試觀古來端人碩士，至今不以書畫名者，偶有所作，自具鳳骨，武進湯貞愍公一門忠孝，片紙隻字，爲藝林所重，蓋非偶得之也。北曾孫定之，書畫兼長，清超拔俗，一如其人，與近人以傾寄險怪爭勝者，不可同日語，凡賞識湯之書畫者，諒不以余言爲謬也。</p>
<h3>汗滴</h3>
<p>— （承明）</p>
<p>筆桿兒忙了一朝，終不及舞女們的一跳。由這點上：可以證明文人的手，不如舞女的足了。</p>
<p>摩登女郎的汗是香汗。勞力的汗是臭汗。同是一樣的汗，有兩樣氣味？</p>
<p>車夫和小販的腿，是飛毛腿。小姐奶奶的腿，是玉腿。同是一樣的腿，有兩樣的名詞。</p>
<p>將一支香烟吸了大半支，所有三分之一的香烟屁股，棄之於地。假如本市三百萬屆民，喜吸香烟的有一百萬人，以每人每日所遺的香烟屁股大洋一分計算，每大三萬元，每月九十萬元，每年一千零八十萬元，以之辦公益事業，或辦實業工廠，也大有可觀。這不過以香烟一項而論，若以其他遺棄的東西，計算起來，不知要加上數十倍呢？</p>
<p>小園藝</p>
<h3>鳳仙</h3>
<p>— （心仁）</p>
<p>鳳仙，是多麽美好又多麽合於音節的名字。也許是爲着這美好的名字的緣故，我對於這毫不被人珍視的草本的鳳仙，特别愛好。</p>
<p>每天早晨起身之後，推開東窗，首先便看見了鳳仙，這裏一共種着五顆，雖然是同時下的種，却是長得有高有矮，這難道是由於雨露也有偏袒嗎？</p>
<p>没有事的時候，我便扶着窗檻有鳳仙，悶氣的時也看鳳仙，鳳仙並不會解除我的悶氣，但是鳳仙却是我寂寞中的伴侣。因爲我在這寰生活着，也跟鳳仙一般的寂寂地。</p>
<p>傍晚時候我會替鳳仙澆一盆水，鳳仙似乎也瞭解澆水人的好意，把萎縮的長葉吐出了鮮綠，也許過幾天鳳仙會開出嬌艶的鮮花，但是我並不希望鳳仙這樣地來報答我，我唯一的目的祗要鳳仙會活着。</p>
<p>今天午後獨自閒步到窗外，看見鳳仙的嫩枝上息着一條長着剌的毛蟲，毛蟲蛟着鳳仙的長葉，我看着，不覺心底浮漾着一陣慘痛。</p>
<p>自然，我爲鳳仙除去毛蟲，並且去掉葉間的蛛網是我責無旁貸的工作。</p>
<p>温柔的月亮下宇宙濳形，</p>
<p>荆棘上遍生了葉葉同情。</p>
<p>我不由得把朋人的詩篇這麽地吟着。吟出了聲音。</p>
<h3>紫薇</h3>
<p>紫薇爲落葉性亞喬木，現已開花</p>
<p>，一枝數穎，一穎數花，微風拂枝，嬌媚可愛。</p>
<p>紫薇初夏開花，至八九月始凋謝，故名百日紅。若以手抓其幹枝，輙動摇，故又名怕癢花。酉陽雜俎云。「紫薇北人呼爲猴郎達樹，謂其無皮，猿不能登也。」</p>
<p>紫薇大多作紫色，間有紅白二色，閩省有作淡紅色者，開時極盛，爛漫如火。</p>
<p>外王父梅初公曾至山東黃縣見有一紫薇樹絶大，環約數夫臂，人多膜拜之者，詢之鄕人，據云：此係紫薇神，可療人疾病也。</p>
<p>繁植此樹，可用高採法，法以兩能分離之花筒或花盆，圍於用以種植之枝，周圍以稻草等物緊縳之，並注意灌溉，毋稍怠忽，待　生　，再種植之。</p>
<p>昔人極愛紫薇，唐白居易有詩云：「絲綸閣下文章靜，鐘鼓樓中刻漏長，獨坐黃昏誰是伴？紫薇花對紫薇郎」。宋楊萬里詩云：「晴霞艶艶覆簷牙，綘雪霏霏點砌沙，莫管身非香案吏，也移床對紫薇花」。皆極愛之也。又「似痴如醉弱還佳，露壓風風欺分外斜，誰道花無紅百日，紫薇長放半年花」。信手寫來，自然貼切。</p>
<h3>蜀葵</h3>
<p>— （劉知命）</p>
<p>世稱罌粟之艶，冠乎羣花，余輙以爲不然，蓋蜀葵花艶媚過之也。此花種色繁多，紅者若醉臉，白者若玉魄，紫者似晚霞，綜紅者若秋楓，黑者若烟墨，疏莖密葉，衆藝丹華，不能使罌粟專美也。</p>
<p>蜀葵之葉可收染紙色，清麗高潔，即昔所謂蜀葵是。</p>
<p>昔有詩云：一花如木槿花相似，葉比芙蓉葉一般，五尺闌干遮不盡，尚留一半與人看」。即咏此花也。蓋蜀葵花似木　，葉若芙蓉，莖高六七尺，浙人謂之一丈紅。</p>
<p>唐陳標詠蜀葵詩云：「眼前無奈蜀葵何，淺紫深紅數百窠，能共特丹爭幾許，得人輕處祗緣多」。物以希爲貴，吾爲蜀葵花一嘆。</p>

<h3>江蘇省敎育會之動機</h3>
<p>自民國二十年一月二十七日國府明令公布敎育會法以後、江蘇各縣遵章改組縣區敎育會時逾三載、未嘗籌設省敎育會、近頃以來、崇明嘉定鹽城松江上海等縣敎育會、爲縣敎育經費問題、或請求保障維持或爲公理之呼籲、均遭壓迫、理不得伸、現由崇明等縣敎育會通函各縣敎育會、並依照國府公布之敎育會法、開列意見、徵求各縣敎育會同意、以便早日成立江蘇省敎育會云、</p>

<h3>解釋職業補習班資格</h3>
<p>敎部據江蘇敎廳轉據青浦縣敎局呈、以該縣西溪小學、前爲厲行生産敎育起見、曾附設職業補習班招收高小畢業生修習一年、以便出就職業、惟該項畢業生、尚有少數因無業可就、仍擬繼續升學者、核其程度已與初中一年級相若、是否可許其應初中二年級揷級考試、如果程度相當、能否予以轉學一年級、又次項畢業生之畢業證書是否須由廳騐印請核示等情、敎部指令該廳云、查小學附設職業補習班、其課程偏重於職業訓練不能認爲與初中一年級程度相當、該項畢業學生、如欲繼續升學、仍須應初中一年之入學試騐、不能應初中二年級之揷班考試、至此項補習班學生修業期滿、應由學校給予學業成績證明書、無庸發給畢業證書云云、</p>

<h3>助産學校的修業年限應否統一？（下）</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>這是說明修業年限雖然長短不同，而所授課程，還是一律，並不變更分别的辦不通。</p>
<p>反之，要是所定的課程，是隨着修業年限的長短而各不同，卽因入學資格的高低而各不同，怎麽樣呢？譬如高小畢業所授的五年課程，並不與初中畢業者三年中所授的課程相同：高小畢業的資格程度大差了，不能與初中畢業者受同樣課程；必須於初中畢業者三年中所授課程而外，還要補習二年類似初中中的基本課程。高中畢業的呢，那因程度更高的關係，所授的課程，當然更可以縮小些。這辦法，在表面上看來，似乎理由很充分：入學資格差一點，程度低一點，仍與以學習助産的機會，拿補習的方法，於一般助産課程之外，補充一些基本學識。其實，仍然不是妥善辦法。第一，旣然高小畢業學習助産，需要五年的修業年限，她何不直直爽爽地進初中去讀，到了畢業以後，再進助産學校呢。因爲其中的年限，計算起來，相差只是一年；如果有志學習助産的話，决計不在這短短的一年上打算盤的。這種算盤，並不十分經濟，有些地方，倒反有削足適屨之感。其次，一般的助産學校，雖然爲應高小畢業者的入校學習起見，於普通的課程中特别增添一些基本學課，以供一般入學資格較低的學生的補習。然而，其所增添的學課，無論如何，倒底不能與普通的中學校相比，倒底不會有他們的齊整完備的。而且一般的助産學校，事實上能否如此辦到，還是絶大疑問；因爲這種五年制的助産學校，無形中，除普通的助産課程之外，還要特地來設備一班類似初中學程的補習班次呢；這於一般的助産學校，實都不宜於這種做法。在學習者的本身，旣受不到什麽好處，也得不到什麽方便，對於辦理助産學校的當局，不但增加了許多的麻煩，而且事實上、不一定能辦到，敎育部却毅然的訂定于助産敎育的學制中，我便覺得他是走錯了路！結果嗎，只會紊亂助産敎育的學制，决計得不到他的絲毫好處。</p>
<p>對於這助産學校的修業年限，敎育部以前彷彿曾經規定過是二年的。入學資格呢，也似乎只規定是初中畢業。這次把初中畢業者的修業年限增加了一年；同時加上一級高小畢業者須五年的修業年限的特殊的學制。對於增加修業年限問題，我並不表示異議，正如最近敎育部對於全國醫科學校，飭其於學程完了之外，再須增加一年的實習年限，始得正式畢業，職行醫師職務的一樣，那都是正當的辦法；所謂接生助産，事關民命，應當愼重其事，增加修業年限，提高學生程度，我們只有同情，决無異議之理。但提高程度，增加年限，也應有個統一的辦法。凡在同一名稱，同一性質，同一宗旨的助産學校之下，不管官辦也好，民辦也好，理應全國一律，不宜彼此分歧。把入學的資格特殊低降，來延長其修業年限，固然不對：將入學資格特别抬高，而縮短其修業年限，也不妥當。惟有不管主辦者的或官或私，其投考時的入學資格，固應相同，入校後的修業年限，亦應一律，這才是正當辦法，才能統一學制、才有利於中國的助産敎育。（完）</p>
<h3>炎暑常見皮膚病之一濕疹（上）</h3>
<p>— 計濟霖</p>
<p>溽暑蒸人。揮汗如雨。皮膚受汗液之浸潤與剌激。最易發生頑固難治之濕疹。患之者嘗視爲微恙不足爲害。往往自購來沙而等消毒藥永或其他藥品以施治。但以認症不確或藥物濃度不當之故。反使所患滋蔓難治。最近舊雨數輩。卽因是弄巧成拙。乞治於我。星星之火。足以燎原。世事愼微。不僅治病然也。</p>
<p>濕疹。爲炎症性皮膚病之一。醫學上所稱爲炎症者。其主徵有五。卽灼熱，發赤，腫脹，疼痛，及官能障礙。不論何項疾病。只須具備上述五主徵中之一或全備者。統之曰名炎症。而濕疹在輕症之時。因僅有具其中一二種者。然在急性症候經過中。多具上述五主徵。雖官能障礙。比較少見。但濕疹發生於關節屈而者。亦能使行動失常。尤使病人難堪者。濕疹不論輕重。皮膚必異常瘙癢。於加温或出汗時爲甚。致入夜不能寗睡。若起神經衰弱。礙及營養。故濕疹雖爲小恙。不致危及生命。然欲求適當之治療。非有皮膚病專門學識者不爲功。</p>
<p>發生濕疹之原因。分爲内外二種。内因大概爲患腺病，胃腸病，神經病，月經病，糖尿病，腎臟病，肝臟病及貧血衰弱之病人。較易發生。故凡上述病人兼患濕疹者。治療時須注意其原因。如貧血衰弱者。須補血健體是。若僅治其濕疹。捨本逐末。雖告痊愈。終必復發。至外因之中。又可分爲四種。</p>
<p>（一）化學的剌激　剌激較劇之藥品。如硫黃水銀等藥膏。久敷皮膚之上。嘗發生濕疹。其次如工作於製造剌激性藥品工廠者。以皮膚常受藥品剌激之故。亦能發生濕疹。此種濕疹。名曰職業性濕疹。</p>
<p>（二）温熱的剌激。天熱時。皮膚暴露於烈日之中，或火夫鐵工等常與烈火接觸。嘗發生濕疹。但隆冬之時。皮膚受嚴寒之剌激。亦能同樣發生。</p>
<p>（三）器械的剌激　單純因器械的剌激而生濕疹者。比較少見。有之。必與化學的或温熱的剌激合併。例如吾人炎暑旅行。由於發汗致兩股摩擦發生濕疹。冬天雖長途跋步。以不發汗。故不生濕疹。</p>
<p>（四）微菌的侵襲　雖有人在濕疹之鱗屑，滲出物，上皮深層細胞内。發現黃金色葡萄狀微菌。但知此種微菌。决不能單獨發生濕疹。故微菌學說。尚在繼續研究之中。未能確定。</p>
<p>濕疹症候略述　欲說明濕疹之症候。須先知其經過之情形。濕疹從發生以至全治。因其發現的狀態。約分六期。</p>
<p>一·紅斑期（紅斑性濕疹）此期皮色潮紅。略有腫脹。</p>
<p>二·丘疹期（丘疹性濕疹）此期皮膚上生帽針頭大之疹。感有瘙癢。</p>
<p>三·水疱期（水疱性濕疹）皮膚角質層下。以有液體滯留。變爲水疱。内容透明。</p>
<p>四·膿疱期（膿疱性濕疹）水疱内容變爲膿質。</p>
<p>五·濕潤期或結痂期（濕潤性濕疹或結痂性濕疹）水疱或膿疱。因外來之剌激（如衣服之摩擦或搔爬）。或内容之充溢。破潰流出。故皮膚濕潤。且流出之液體。乾燥後結成痂皮。</p>
<p>六·鱗屑期（鱗屑性濕疹）痂皮脫落後。發疹面之角質層。由於新陳代謝之旺盛。而常起鱗狀落屑。及至落屑絶跡。卽濕疹全治之時。</p>

<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識（續）</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（九）說扁桃腺</p>
<p>我做本題「說扁桃腺」的動機。是希望閱報諸位，人人都要知道扁桃腺是一樣什麽東西？他的位置在那裏？他的生理狀態是怎樣？他的病理變化是怎樣？這都是緊要的地方。也就是我要說明的。</p>
<p>（甲）扁桃腺是一樣什麽東西？扁桃腺原名稱爲Ｔonsille。一般俗間稱曰乳蛾。又呌作喉蛾。我國的國醫。也用這兩個名稱。在醫學上稱爲扁桃腺的理由。是因爲他的形狀。像個扁桃。故曰扁桃。又因爲他的組織。是存在粘膜固有層當中的一種特别腺樣組織。故曰腺。所以合併稱他曰扁桃腺。</p>
<p>（乙）他的位置在那裏？扁桃腺普通分爲三種。就是（一）口蓋扁桃腺，（二）舌扁桃腺，（三）咽頭扁桃腺。還有生在咽頭後壁粘膜的顆粒或濾胞。亦可屬於扁桃腺。故有一個。（四）華兒特依愛兒氏扁桃腺環ＷaldegerscherTonsilleuring的名稱。我現在把這幾種扁桃腺的位置。分别說一說。</p>
<p>（一）口蓋扁桃腺廿原名ＴonsillapaＩalinae	或Ｇauneutonsille。口腔的左右兩側。有前後排列的兩個粘膜高起的皺襞。位於前方的。稱爲前口蓋弓。位於後方的。稱爲後口蓋弓。左右口蓋弓的會合處。就是懸壅垂（俗謂小舌頭）。前後兩個口蓋弓的中間（近舌處）。是陷凹而成一窩形。此窩稱爲扁桃腺窩。口蓋扁桃腺卽占居在這個窩内。左右都一樣的。一般人稱作乳蛾或喉蛾。都是指這兩個口蓋扁桃腺而言。我現在更畫一草圖。看了更可明白。</p>
<p>（一）上口唇</p>
<p>（二）下口唇</p>
<p>（三）舌</p>
<p>（四）軟口蓋</p>
<p>（五）懸壅垂</p>
<p>（六）前口蓋弓</p>
<p>（七）後口蓋弓</p>
<p>（八）口蓋扁桃腺</p>
<p>（九）咽頭後壁</p>
<p>（二）舌扁桃腺＝原名Ｔonsillalingnal，或Zungeutonsille。在舌根部。</p>
<p>（三）咽頭扁桃腺＝原名Ｔonsillapharyugea，或Ｒacheutonsille在鼻咽腔部。故又名鼻咽腔扁桃腺。</p>
<p>（丙）他的生理狀態是什樣？扁桃腺到了春機發動期。就要由生理的退行變性而萎縮。可是遇到常常發生炎症或患增殖肥大的時候。那就不會有生理的萎縮了。</p>
<p>（丁）他的病理變化是什樣？扁桃腺的病理變化。就是指炎症和增殖肥大而言。在臨床上看起來。小兒患增殖肥大的。比較成人多。成人患炎症的。則比小兒多。一切的詳細病情。待我下次再談罷。</p>
<p>（勘誤）上期傷風病情中，有「稀薄水樣漿液性」悮刋「稀薄木樣漿液性」。</p>
<p>治療方法中，有「檸檬汗」悮刋「檸檬汗」及「熱水洗足」悮刋「汗水洗足」。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（十五）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>乾酪性肺炎的發生地方，大半是在肺小泡裏面的；這裏面是充滿着滲出液和纖維素肺小泡上皮的，這種情形，和尋常的眞性肺炎是相彷彿的。結果這滲出液漸漸的被吸收了，呈一種乾酪狀態。他的病灶範圍，是大小没有一定的；有僅限於局部的，有彌漫擴大至一肺全葉，並且可以侵犯到二葉三葉之地位的。局部範圍，係從一腺體小胞，擴張到一肺小葉的大小，這就是上面所講的氣管枝肺炎性一種了。所以乾酪性肺炎和氣管支炎性，根本的性質上，本來没有什麽區别的；祗是病變蔓延的情形，和病灶範圍大小不同罷了！這種病在臨床上的情勢，是嚴重非常的，差不多在幾個月裏面，總陷於不治的。他的病變經過，可分爲二時其：第一是膠狀透明期，大致有二星期的長久；第二是乾酪變性期，差不多有一個月或一個半月的長久。最後當然可以趨於軟化而發生空洞的；也可以發生石灰性硬化，使病者可延長數年生命的但這總究是最少數。</p>
<p>增生性和滲出性肺結核兩種代表的例子，散在性粟粒結核和乾酪性肺炎，上面大概已經說過了！但是我們要曉得，事實上的肺結核病，並不是完全固定着在一方面的，是兩種混雜不清的：除去顯微鏡下的工作，可以分别某一部分屬增生性，某一部分屬滲出性病變外，在臨床上面，有時是没有法子分明的。就是一般的結核乾酪變性和空洞三個時期的變化，我們也應該曉得，在每一個病人中，一部分病灶已發現空洞，他部分尚在乾酪變性結核或石灰硬化性的例子，是儘多着呢！並不是發現空洞，其他的病灶變化都是清一色的。這一點事實，我想讀者們也是不可忽略過的。</p>

<p>到戲院裏去看頑藝，無論看歌劇，話劇，耍影，聽音樂，都不是眞休息，眞「鬆弛」Ｒelaxation，並且都是靜的娱樂，不是動的玩意兒，多在室内，不在户外。所可慰藉的，就是總可歡娱視聽，敎注意力的焦點換個動向，在精神上把業餘的賞心樂事和正當工作調劑一下。遇到逢塲作戲，閙着頑笑的笑料，更可笑逐顔開，發發笑勁。因此，别管能不能欣賞藝術吧，就是凑凑熱閙，看看花樣，領略些低級趣味，亦有足多，未可厚非。這無須打着「人生行樂耳」的濫調，也不必站在所謂「有閒階級」，料想大家都具有同慨的（國難未已，憂國之土或多主張應長期停止娱樂，但與本題不涉）。</p>
<p>看頑藝旣於調劑精神有益（有時時間過晚，或所受剌激過深，每致失眠，或資料卑劣，無形中要威受些不良影響，當别論），何以又會在衛生上發生問題呢？原來這是横生枝節；最容易見到，也是大家常常呌苦的，在物理現象上，例如電影院裏，往往因爲透氣設備不完善，演至中段將休息未休息時，每覺空氣污濁，「殺氣騰騰」，殊不能耐，日塲尤甚（因白天復須關窗的緣故），劇塲裏除上述類似情形外，往往因爲對於地面的管理欠妥，又每致塵埃瀰漫，「土香」（？）撲鼻，好一似中着了某種軍用毒氣，催人噴嚔，都是。在生物現象上，例如一般遊客在劇塲裏，往往因爲急不暇擇地亂購灑水或露售的果品，露售或陳宿的熟食解渴或充飢，沾染些某種污穢病病菌（四季都有，夏季特甚），或是承蒙茶房案目優待，絞塊臉布擦一擦臉，抹一抹手，奅碗茶喝喝，從臉布或茶杯上沾染些沙眼毒，淋菌，梅毒螺旋體，種種皮膚病病菌或白喉菌（這也不論時季；但包廂池座也的上客每特易遇到），都是。</p>
<p>屋子裏二氱化炭太多，「氣價太貴」丨丨氱氣太少：依物以少爲貴的通例，所以說太貴了丨丨，牠的弊害，現在固知没有像從前所說那樣的嚴重丨丨因爲同時應注意的温濕度和空氣的流動，也佔重要位置，就是當時發了回兒擁擠中毒的症狀，散塲後從新吸足了新鮮空氣，還是會得好。塵埃的質點雖小，多有極鋒利的稜角，吸入呼吸道，特易擦傷粘膜，實開種呼吸系傳染病病菌深入組織的門徑，此乃常人所忽視；有時塵埃上也就帶着些「活搏鮮跳」的病菌丨丨轉從病人或病郵的痰，唾液或飛沫染到丨丨，同被吸入。但這亦或須日積月累，才見惡果，給一般只顧眼前舒適的人講，也許「夜長夢多」，說不明白。又稍有常識的人，對於茶房的絞臉布，奅茶，也許已能「君命有所不受」般地毅然拒却，或是更進一步，對於塲子裏一切兜賣食物，也許都已能注意愼擇，不致「上當」，而問題最大，情勢最急，爲我們最少注意，且最難防範的傳病「因子」，便是塲子裏大衆所呼出或噴出的飛沫（冷天最易察見，俗稱氣寒水或呵氣）。塲子裏充滿着含有各人所吐飛沫的空氣，這才够看戲的人受用？</p>

<h3>創作與修養</h3>
<p>— 冬生</p>
<p>世上一切事物的成形，决不是一回偶然的事實，愈光輝而偉大的，其創造時所化之辛苦的成分一定是比較浮淺的未得深厚的；埃及金字塔之所以能傳留到現在，不是因爲有當日設計者和建築者之無限腦力和血汗交織其間嗎？說得淺近些，在難稽的荒古以前，巨塊的林木，埋在地層，經了冷熱的突擊，復受外界的壓迫，凝成了石塊，再經了無量的歲月，如逝的流光，由石而爲炭，自有烟而成爲無烟，經摩擦，淬勵，瀑洒，侵蝕，終於成爲燦爛之金剛石，在一刹那的讚美中人們想必是不爲注意這些時間之長久的累積吧？</p>
<p>偉大的文藝作品，如燦爛的金剛石一般，也是要經過長期的胚胎而才能問世的，又如女人産兒一樣，必須要有十月的懷胎，痛苦的生育，先天不足的，中途必爲夭折，托爾斯泰以七年之久寫了戰爭與和平，終究成爲百世讚美的傑作，多産的作家道威生，雖然文章寫得很快，但，没有一篇可說是有永久的價值的。</p>
<p>這裏就發生了創作與修養的問題了，所謂修養者，就是體微的意思，也可以說是深刻的想像，思潮一來，不是馬上就動而執筆，發而爲文，必得要慢慢的細嚼，緩緩的揣度，把思潮組成起來使之更眞切化，一寫下來，就不致有多大可指摘之處，一切令讀者具有一個並非一刹那的感動而是有永久迴憶的印象。</p>
<p>體味，對於一切遭歷深入的體味，是使創作偉大的一個條件，能體微才會從幻想裏造出眞相，又自事實裏見到意義，從平凡裏見到精深，從瑣碎裏見到完整，能體微，才會有豐富的優美的想像産生出來，在心頭裏織成一種超自然的文彩。</p>
<p>見到什麽了想到什麽了，於是就來了創作的熱望，在創作的努力中，總希望把想像表現出來，把渾然的情意，翻譯爲着迹的文字，這個希望是不容易達到的，也許自來的文家都不曾能充分的達到，其原因，大概是由於未曾有深厚的修養吧！到心完全是坦然了，表現的力量已經到了飽和的狀態，於是開始動筆，寫下來，至少總比拿起筆就寫容易達到把想像完全翻譯成文字的企圖吧！</p>
<p>不僅此也，拿了筆就寫在紙面的，無非是些事實，平凡，瑣碎。除了這些以外還有什麽呢！但經過了修養這層累的就不同了，旣經作者深入的體微，又給用此精妙的技巧，處處都能很適宜的組織起來，就敎讀者不只是看見了這些，還在這些以外，接觸了作者所體微的一切，於是，因此而發生了一種鑑賞的喜悅，創作的成功是達到了。</p>
<p>在現日之浮誇的文壇裏，不會有新鮮的好文藝産生出來，因爲創作之修養的成分是太不深厚了，也可以說作者對於自已的作品都尚且没有一個深切的認識，何能引起讀者的共鳴呢！</p>
<h3>我來自東（十五）</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>我覺得我們國家糟塌了他們。丨丨爲什麽中國不能有一個和日本郵船會社一樣的東西？爲什麽中國不能用這些青年來替國家構成强有力的太平洋艦隊？</p>
<p>船上中國船員，在九一八以後，曾有相當的組織。他們愛國的熱誠，是非常可以欽佩的。他們約束着自已，凡船過日本，不許登陸。在意氣上說，是足不履讐國之土地；在理智上說，一上日本的岸，你至少要坐日本電車，要用些錢買些日本貨，要吃日本的飯菜，這是自已破壞中國的杯葛運動，是給日本人以鼓勵。他們執行這個决議，以前非常嚴勵，對於船員是强制，對於船客（中國人）是勸告。如果勸告不從，他們也只有用榮譽來制裁。然而一年以來，這個運動，已漸漸過去了。船上有些愛國心極强的，依舊約束自已，比較不守約束的，便一到横濱神户，上岸求下流之娱樂。</p>
<p>我們到横濱以前，便大家互相商量。香港姊妹是主張不去的，我自已實在想去一看，因爲我們研究國際問題的，對於這個世界糾紛發源地，要親自觀察才可以滿其慾壑。何况我早有計劃，要在東京下幾個月，來細細研究在歇斯脫利亞中的日本民族和社會。船停在横濱港口，日本的海關人員便上船來。茶房把我們的護照拿去，據說護照上當三年前自上海到美洲時，已蓋有日本當局的印，所以上岸上船毫無問題。以後我發現日本的海關對於不帶行李的船客，根本没有盤問和檢查。這是日本招攬游客的手段。中國政府對美國人要收上岸費，因此，愛錢的美國人說日本政府比中國政府要客氣些。</p>
<h3>落日</h3>
<p>— 劉實君</p>
<p>那時，一輪紅日，彷彿厭倦了這滿眼秋色的人間，向無涯的天海沉沉欲墮；魚鱗似的白雲，沐在血潮怒湧的西天，把昏濛和黯澹全消失了，幻出眩目的紅黃紫的顔色。隊隊的歸鴉，啞啞的噪着，似乎有點特殊的神情，不知他們是傷悼落日的西沉，還是驚異西天的炫爛？</p>
<p>時間一瞬一瞬的逝去，落日的車輪也旋轉不息，終於漸漸地西沉了。眩目的鱗雲，一半變成了窒息的雲骸，一半化作流霞悠然飛散。歸鴉愈噪愈急，彷彿是人間的薤露。我想，不知有多少人們，爲這具有烈火一般雄心的落日傷悼？也不知有多少人們，詛咒這夜之嚮導的黃昏之降臨？但，在傷悼和詛咒中，來的偏要來，去的終不能不去，似乎厭倦了人間的落日，終於毫不遲疑毫不留戀地把全盤世界讓給了黃昏。</p>
<p>黃昏在沉默中統治了世界。</p>
<p>紅日已落，夜還未臨，我帶着許多說不出的情味，獨自歸來，如消失了的殘夢般的兒時往事，驀然地浮上心頭。那時，我大約是七八歲，記不清楚了，因爲母親太珍愛了的原故，不許我一個人到野外去閑玩，尤其是日暮黃昏的時候；我呢，心裏雖想聽母親的話，而有時因敵不住伙伴們的招誘，身子立着不動，眼睛裏却射出羨慕和揭想的光芒，母親看出了這心情，不忍過於拂了我的意，但又不放心，只得陪我同去。記得，那時她曾告訴我，日落的時候，如果西邊起了黑雲，呌做烏雲接日，明天天氣一定不好；她又告訴我，天邊在日落時如果燒得通紅，晚上必定繁星燦爛；她更告訴我，日落的時候，要出來一些不好的東西，我問她是些什麽，她好像是怕傷了我的童心，總不肯說，只反復地告訴我，那些不好的東西，不能給我們什麽好處，他們要日落時才出現呢。她那時似乎没有想到，她底兒子，也有獨看落日的時候。這些話，母親不知告訴了我若千次，已深深地刻在我的童心裏：所以，今天雖是獨看客中的落日，好像還站在母親傍邊，消失了多年的往事，又驀然地浮上心頭。</p>
<p>在沉默中，夜還没來，黃昏依然統治着我們底世界。</p>

<h3>青年就業問題</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>青年究竟有没有出路？這問題，粗看之，似頗不易解答。因爲從理論方面講，這可以牽涉到社會病態，地主榨迫，農村經濟崩潰等大問題。如果再說得擴大些，這還可推廣到列强經濟侵略，世界的不景氣，帝國主義者的没落等嚴重話頭。可是抛棄理論來談事實，我覺得青年的出路問題，並没有像上述的那般嚴重。他們究竟有没有出路，其關鍵完全在青年的本身：換句話說，這完全在他們的能否自覺。現在把我親知親聞的幾樁事縷述如左：</p>
<p>某都會有一師範學校，今年暑假有三級學生已經畢業。以每級四十人計，暑後就有一百二十位青年要攢進社會之網。他們在將要畢業的當兒，除了預備功課和恐怕會考不能及格外，還擔心着畢業後的出路問題。他們暗中固早在紛紛託人，便是學校當局也函牘紛馳，把這一輩未來的改造者盡力地向各地敎育局或各小學推薦。他們理想的標準是：地點，要都會；時間，每週至多授課九百分；報酬，每月三十元。</p>
<p>有位敎師懷着一番好意，介紹甲青年到某地小學中服務去；那青年答應也已經答應了，可是結果他又把聘書退回。問其原因，報酬距理想的標準僅差四元。乙青年因要每週擔任一千二百分的功課，無可推諉，只好說身體吃不消，情願把事情回掉。丙青年，母校小學裏想請他回去服務。他也因報酬未達標準之數，初則唯唯否否，卽而東也碰壁西也碰壁，祇好再去哀求那母校校長安揷。丁青年自稱他的家鄕某小學要呌他去，可是因地處偏僻，終不願就。戊青年擅長音樂。他在母校裏彈慣鋼琴，因此他向人宣稱說小學裏如果没有鋼琴，他是不願屈就的。還有已青年，某小學挽人向他接洽，按月報酬二十二元。那青年劈頭卽向來人說道：「這眞是笑話，」弄得來人討了一塲没趣而去。</p>
<p>以上都是實例。此外還有庚辛壬癸等等青年，老是坐在家裏靜待機遇。不知時間是毫不留情的，他們只知等，等，等。結果：七月終了，各小學人員差不多都已定局，而都市中遂平添了無數流浪者，還在作黃金之夢。</p>
<p>青年究竟有没有出路，鐵一般的事實已告訴我們是如此。如上所述的那幾位青年，他們明明前面有一條路可以出，而他們偏不肯出；那末爲治標計我們縱高談什麽，「現在青年失業之衆多，均由於過去數十年間敎育方針之錯誤及中等敎育内容與社會生活，人民生計之關係至爲微薄」的論調，（見八月二日本報大學生失業救濟問題消息）又有什麽用丨青年在求學時代，時常喜談「苦幹」，「悶幹」，「到民間去」，「改造農村」等時髦話頭，可是一朝眞個要呌他們這樣做，他們便口不應心了。他們心裏只想着物質上的舒適或報酬的厚薄：他們眼中盡充滿了都市裏紅紅綠綠的色彩以及種種誘惑。這種病態，他們還不自覺，旁人有什麽法可想丨</p>
<p>師範生如此。以此類推，他種學生又何嘗不如此？初高中畢業生想做郵務員，洋行買辦，銀行主任以及什麽科長專員等。大學畢業生則又想做一任官。自無怪社會上肩不能挑，手不能提的失業者日見其多了。所以青年究竟有没有出路？這個問題，我敢引事實證明道，他們並不能說没有出路，只是他們走錯了方向。　二十三年八月於蘇州</p>
<h3>災象下</h3>
<p>— 連珍</p>
<p>李三娘兩隻脚只顧在水車上盤旋，一個心却正是打算着這樣又那樣。</p>
<p>月亮灣灣地已經從地平綫底下透起來，火熖般灼人的熱流，好像消滅了大半，這時凉風微微地吹拂着。李三娘爲了依仍不願放過這一天的唯一的好機會，雖然丈夫在家裏重病着，當這微弱的月光下，獨個兒仍舊鼓着最後的餘勇，兩隻脚把這水車的輪子盤旋着。盤旋着。</p>
<p>夜的沉寂漸漸地擴大起來。李三娘的心一分增加着一分的繁亂着。想想丈夫眞也够可憐了，眼見着田地裏水一點點地乾涸起來。那無異是合家人的血肉的結晶丨丨那禾秧。一天枯萎着一天。半個月來，兩個人終日終夜的踏着水車，然而什麽用呢？什麽用呢？田地仍舊在一天天更利害的龜裂。可憐的丈夫終於在焦急的疲勞的雙重襲擊之下，病了。李三娘這時踏着水車輪子的脚，不覺緩慢起來。</p>
<p>她更想起往日這時光，這微弱的月光下，就照着兩個肩並肩的影子，一邊也還有個小孩兒的形跡。許多令人奮發的慰語常常從男人的口裏流出，李三娘亦就從來不感着過分勞疲，如果有時她眞的感着有些微乏力了，男子就會用着唱歌一、般柔弱的調子道：「三娘子，你憇憇吧，讓我獨個兒來」於是李三娘子有時便眞的從水車上跳了下來，那個男子就更用力量地搬動着水車的輪子，不過從没有一次超過十分鐘的限度，李三娘就會從復跳上來，嘻嘻地兩隻脚又在飛一般運動着了。李三娘想到這裏，情不自禁的眼眶裏流下了幾點滬水。</p>
<p>又想起：這時候丈夫正不知怎樣地在痛苦中煎熬着。丈夫已經四五天没有吞進一粒米殼了。而且今天的病勢更有些異樣，水亦不要喝了，雖說陳老伯的藥方大家都說很有見效，然而動不動每次就要三塊錢。還要加上半塊多洋的藥費。家裏早當的精光了，這幾天的醫藥費，全是小菱兒的……李三娘想不下去了，她索性伏住了水車架子，兩隻脚靜止着，抽噎起來。</p>
<p>呵！可憐的小菱兒呵，從生下來到而今，就從没有過一天舒適的日了，小時候雙親都要在田間工作，有時就像隻野狗般被遺落在家的屋角裏，有時就像夏季的西瓜似的曝露在漫野的田角。漸漸地能够跑了跳了，當冬天就要伊赤着小足　浸入凝凍的河浜摸着水産，一面還要乘早趕到市集去呌賣。</p>

<h3>今年的蠶絲業及其前途</h3>
<p>— 迪庵</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>蘇浙春繭市塲，大多已告收束，蠶户一季辛勤之結果，是虧是贏，不僅影響於個别農家的生活，且因蘇浙爲中國著名蠶絲區域，多數農户以養蠶爲主業，蠶收之豐歉，因而對整個農村經濟有决定的意義，而繭價之高下，更與農民生活有密切之關係。年來蠶絲業之袁落，猶如江河日下，一瀉千里，海外市塲，旣爲日本所控制，而内國銷塲，又因全國民經濟之崩潰而日見狹隘，蠶絲業之難於發展，已成爲有目共睹之事實。今日蠶繭情况，據散見於報上者來說，雖不能不謂豐收，而繭價不高，銷路堵塞，蠶户反而虧蝕者比比皆是。一年復一年，行將見蠶户裏足不前，而形成蠶絲業之空前的零落吧。兹將繭市情形及絲市銷路，作一般的觀察，或亦爲關心蠶絲業者所樂聞歟？</p>
<p>今年蠶收，蘇浙皆屬豐順，雖蠶期開始之初，因天時不正，寒冷反常，早幫飼育土種者因而多發現病蠶，至二眼時，傾棄者不少。其後天漸暖，寒暖適宜，故經過甚佳，土種晚幫，亦有八成以上之年幾，雖比去年稍差，而與早幫之祇有三成年歲者相較，固已有天壤之差。至於飼育改良種之蠶，因與天時好歹無大關係，故有十足收成。就浙省各蠶區來說，今歲由建設廳分發改良種六十萬張，每張出繭，最高五十斤，最少亦有二十斤，平均共産繭一千八百萬擔，且繭質亦甚優厚。蘇省方面之飼育改良種者，其情形亦正相同。</p>
<p>蠶汛之良好，本爲蠶户最堪慰籍之事，惟繭價之低落，亦開近年來之新紀錄，故得不償失。</p>
<p>改良種優繭最高之價，不過三十五元，最低則祗有二十元，與去年最高四四元，最低二五元相較，下跌頗巨；若就土種繭來說丨大半農户日養土種的丨則最高不出二十元，最低祇有十二元，與民國十四年之最高九十元，去年之三十三元相較，不免有隔世之感。繭價雖如此低廉，桑葉價則並無多大跌落，浙江方面，雖因蠶户减少，葉産豐足，而有供過於求之勢，間有跌至每擔三角者，然此寗爲特殊現象，一般平均每擔總在一元五角左右，亦有貴至二元以上者。若以繭每擔食桑葉十五擔計，則養改良種者雖不至完全賠本，但已無贏餘可圖了，至於養土種之蠶户，不僅毫無贏餘，且尚須每擔虧蝕血本近十元之多。江蘇蠶户，則因桑葉缺乏，葉價飛漲，每擔桑葉須價三元三四角，因此鮮繭葉本，每百斤就需五十餘元，以與繭市最高價三十五元相比，亦相差十餘元之多，至於土種蠶繭，更不消說了。今年蠶户之虧蝕，於此便可窺見一斑；一季辛勤，不僅不能獲得勞力之相當代價，反而虧耗血本，其打擊之深且重，是不卜可知了！丨</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>考繭價之所以如此跌落，不消說是由於絲市疲乏，銷路閉塞所致。國内絲廠，因歷年虧蝕，無法維持，關廠倒閉者時有所聞：上海一處，本有絲廠一百零八家之多，而新繭上市之前，勉强繼續開工者祇有五六家，現雖處春繭發動之期，而恢復營業者祇有閘北積餘，裕通，楚信，源記及其他二十餘家，南市之寶泰四廠及曹家渡一帶，仍無一家開工者，浙江開工絲廠，亦祇有六七家，且均係暫局，於絲蠶汛過後，即將停止。他方面歐美絲繭市塲，亦仍極蕭條。去年五六月間歐美市塲最高滬廠經，每擔可售九百元以上，至下半年則逐漸步落，每擔跌落二三百元不等；今春則更無起色，每擔竸跌入五百元，而最近歐美市塲中最高滬廠經，每擔開盤四百五十餘元，且前途尚是暗淡無光。如以絲每擔平均需鮮繭十三擔，或乾繭四擔半計，成本就需五百元，縱令不計一切其他費用，每擔亦須虧蝕幾十元血本了。絲價旣如此跌落，則新繭之無出路與繭價大跌，可說是不然的趨勢而無法提高的。</p>
<p>但是，在中國，除此世界恐慌與日絲傾銷所發生的壓迫之外，重壓在蠶户肩上的似尚有其他的桎梏。這就是由蠶業統制而來的意外的負擔與抑價政策。對於中國的蠶絲業，政府當局聽說是用很大力量來改良的，行政院對於改良蠶絲事業，擬有專條，而「技術合作」的國際專家，亦爲改進中國的蠶絲業而努力着。但是，不管如此，實際的情形，往往是在剥削蠶户，使蠶户不僅不能得到當局改良的好處，反而受到意外的負擔。這在今年無錫繭業公會同江隂繭業公會等反對江蘇省的蠶絲業統制法案問題中，就可明白看出來。</p>
<p>這裏，問題是有兩方面的，第一是限制繭行，第二爲徵收改良費等。據無錫繭業同業公會的意見，則「繭行統制辦法第四條一二三項規定，有登記核定抽籤等語，名爲統制，實行限制，不特剥削繭行行主納帖開行營業自由橦利，抑且使蠶户售繭蒙受行少人擠抑價遍賣路遠蒸壞諸幣書。限制之不足，又重困之經濟壓迫，如第六條規定收繭者須予先登記，並繳每擔乾繭保證金三元，第八條規定，收廠各商，每收乾繭一擔，有自願承認蠶樟價及改進蠶桑事業費十二元之義務。此種變相捐欵，更甚於從前釐稅，病商害民，孰甚於此」。</p>
<p>「見仁見智」容或有所不同，以改良蠶絲業爲已任的當局，聲言「繭行統制，爲本省救濟蠶絲業整個辦法之一，中國絲業，已至最危險之程度，若不亟謀改進，大受國際傾軋，陷於破産，農民生計，商人地位，根本將受影響，故無論如何，决不有所變更。且省府與中央，主張相同。至於征收改良費一節，浙省去秋，已經實行，本年又復徵收有例在先。况改良蠶絲事業之用，與捐稅不同。倘有少數不明事理份子，不顧農民前途利益，有意阻撓事業進行，决予嚴厲取締云云」（五月三十一日大晚報）。</p>
<p>這樣，官方是以保護「農民前途利益」爲神聖的已責了，農民應該感謝的。但是，很可惜的，農民不知道感謝，自願放棄「前途利益」，如「金壇縣舊式繭行，原有二十七家，自本年實行統制以後，一律廢止，另由無錫絲業鉅子薛壽萱等聯合該邑舊繭商，集資築成新式繭行四家，設備非常完善。現屆開行收繭，以繭行旣少，繭價可以限制，看高祇有二十五六元，鄕民以不敷成本，發生衝突，致四行均被搗毁，現經金壇縣府，電省請派保安隊到金彈壓，風潮尚難平息」（六月七日申報）。其他地方的農民怎麽樣呢？他們因爲不願受「繭價因統制關係，扯價不高」的賜惠，「紛紛自烘自繅」了，他們是沉默的，但飲恨在心。</p>
<p>至於徵收改良費的實際的負担者又是誰呢？俗語說得好，「羊毛出在羊身上」，結局還不是落在農民身上？對於這一點，商人們也是很坦白的，他們說：「辦法第八條載，凡核准之收繭商，每收乾繭一担，有承認改良繭種價及改進蠶桑費十二元義務等語，際此海外絲市一落千丈，農村經濟已瀕絶境，廠商破産者十居八九。即不令其負此義務，尚多裹足不前，若再强令捐納，當益畏苛政之猛於虎也。抑且是項加高負担，名雖取之於商，實則取於農，繭業前途，益陷於萬刦不復之地」（見江隂繭業公會電六月五日大晚報）。</p>
<p>中國蠶户在絲業的世界的恐慌，日本絲的傾銷與國内捐欵的三重負担之下，雙肩是被壓的立不起身了，他們大有「厭薄養蠶之觀念，去桑植禾，三分有一」然而不養蠶又怎樣呢？種植其他農産的農民，又何嘗不作如是想？</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>最後，讓我簡單的來考察一下中國蠶絲業的前途吧。如果先說結論，人們就不難斷言：中國蠶絲業的黃金時代早已過去，如果没有非常的事變發生（如日本一九二三年那樣的大地震等），中國的蠶絲業的趨勢，祇會一年裏退一年，挽回頽勢，差不多是絶望的。這原因，第一在於中國蠶絲業本身之缺陷，不能與外國的蠶絲業作競爭。因爲中國農民的負担與窮困的嚴重，是世界任何獨立國家的農民不能比擬的，他們無力改良蠶桑的品種，無法享受近代技衛的恩惠，因襲的育蠶方法與環境的惡劣，使他們的出品不能與在科學的養育之下的出品相况爭，海外的銷路，是因此被是印等國奪去的：政府現雖發布了蠶絲條例，企冀改進蠶絲，但如果不忘過去與眼前的成績，人們祇能說這不過多加農民的負担，對於蠶絲業的眞正的改良上的貢獻，恐怕是微乎其微。</p>
<p>第二蠶絲業在今日的世界已經成爲老朽的産業，人造絲工業的飛奔的發展，蠶食了天然絲的領域，使蠶絲的銷路，急激的被排除而减少：年來日美意德等國的人造絲事業的一日千里的進展，及其代替天然絲用途之日益增加，可知這老朽的産業的立足是一年困難一年了。縱令人造絲還不能完全替代天然絲，後者保有不能消滅的長處，但是，過去光榮的地位之已被剥奪，那是絲毫都没有疑問了。在這種情形之下，落後的中國蠶絲業所受的脅威，是更其嚴重的。</p>
<p>第三，不消息說的便是日本蠶絲業的壓迫。在十九世紀末葉，中國絲在世界上還是獨覇一方，但自進入二十世紀以來，這覇權一直就被日本奪了去，邇來已經有三十多年了，在這久長的年月之中，日本的蠶絲界築成了堅固的壁壘，落後的中國蠶絲界要想衝破這個壁壘而奪取世界覇權，在事實是很難能的，縱令在理論上是這種可能，但並非短時期所能奏效的。在這以前，中國的蠶絲業將始終嘗受日本品傾銷的壓迫與排擠，連世界市塲中微弱的地位都很不易保持下去吧。</p>
<p>最後，世界恐慌正在發展，和普通的商品苦於過剩而找不到出路一樣，蠶絲業的生産過乘與由一般恐慌所産生的購買力之急减，使絲絹銷路極端閉塞，這雖可由世界恐慌之解消而恢復起來，但世界恐慌不僅暫時没有克服的希望，就是有了克服的徵兆，若要恢復到過去的繁榮，恐怕是再無可能了。因此，在這種種的原因錯雜之下，中國蠶絲業的前途，的確盡是荆棘。樂觀論者的根據，恐怕是極其薄弱的吧</p>

<p>我國絲業，向佔對外貿易中一重要地位，年來遭世界經濟恐慌之震盪，日本絲之競銷，及及種種其他複雜原因，竟大見衰落。最近形勢，更形慘敗，尤以上海絲廠爲一蹶不振。作者求明瞭實際情况起見，不避暑熱，連日向各方調查，特將所得，草成此篇，藉覘絲廠之内部狀况。</p>
<p>少數絲廠慘淡經營</p>
<p>吾人推溯中國絲廠業之起源，上海實爲機械繅絲業之發祥地，論沿革亦居全國絲業之重心地位。依據民國十九年之調查，上海絲廠廠基有百零五家，絲車二萬五千零六六部，約占全國絲車半數以上，每月産製廠絲七千餘擔，工作人員不下十萬之譜，駸駸焉爲華絲對外貿易之中堅。詎意好景不常，絲業之黃金時期，迺於是年爲世界經濟恐慌所捲入漩渦，開始其衰頽徵象。一面爲人造絲充斥之侵迫，一面遭日本絲競爭之控制，輸出年减，市價頻跌，銷路滯塞，存貨堆積，因之週轉失調，擱淺停閉者，比比皆是。其間二十年及二十一年雖經政府兩次發行公債並免納出口稅以爲救濟，卒難挽旣倒之狂瀾。二十二年春因美國提高銀價影響，絲價隨之轉漲，各絲廠重振旗鼓，大有復興趨勢，但入秋後即復疲態，抑且跌勢加厲，逼近五百元大關，廠商所受之虧累於此曇花一現者，不知凡幾，致一般實力企業家，咸視絲廠爲畏途，相率裹足。今春所開少數絲廠均係暫局性質，大都捉衿見肘，勉强經營，而目前絲價又見慘跌，虧耗不貲，固未嘗一刻不在焦急中也。最近上海絲廠開車者，經作者調查完竣，特表列於下：</p>

<p>以上繅絲廠三十二家，雙宫廠一家，共三十三家。其中合資經營者，約占三分之二；代客包繅者，約三分之一弱，其由去年賡續者，則寥寥無幾。統計絲車七。五一○部。僅爲十九年之百分之三○。每月繅絲約二千餘擔，年計亦不過二萬餘擔，以此推想全國絲廠生産數量較之十九年當大見减縮，而絲價依然降跌不已，號稱富貴品之蠶絲，如此下塲，世界經濟恐慌之影響，於此可見一班矣。</p>
<p>今年繭價空前慘跌</p>
<p>年來業絲繭者，鑒於市况衰落之嚴重，過去失敗之深刻，談虎色變，印象惡劣，本不敢輕於嘗試，惟有一般欲罷不能之人士或鑒於今春繭市，度必寥落，於是東凑西籌，集合資本，組織局面。其資金數額，大都不過數千元。（實力充厚者，固不乏人，但究屬少數。）向例：信用較好者，每將全部資金交付銀錢業，要求貸欵，出發收繭。（信用貸欵，似甚少見。）貸欵數額，視借者信用孚弱，酌定多寡，普通可貸資本總額之三倍（以抵押爲原則），惟絶對受貸出方面之監察，同往繭區辦繭，而收得之繭，運滬推存被指定之貨棧抵押，另籌流動金以分批出貨，繅製生絲。</p>
<p>惟本年此種辦法，亦屬難得。蓋頻年絲市衰落，銀錢業受絲繭貸欵之賠累者，不知凡幾；因之絶對拒絶絲繭放欵者有之，絲業難振，此亦主因之一。今春絲商收繭辦法，太抵籌携少數現欵。分赴内地由繭行行主代爲用欵者有之，甚至由行主之信用擔保，向蠶農賖欠者亦有之。此種危險嘗試，蠶農之受欺者，蓋數聞矣。</p>
<p>今春繭市，果如若輩所期。江浙蠶訊，育種雖較往年大减，收成，皆屬豐順，無奈各地繭行開稱者，稀若晨星，因之銷路擁塞，繭價慘跌，蠶户反而虧蝕，造成空前徵象。作者曾向各方探索，徵求實情，據中興路公大絲廠朱問樵君所述，頗爲詳盡，蓋朱君多年出入江浙内地，辦理繭務，身臨親騐，見聞自確，承示以近五年來江浙主要産繭區域之春繭價格變遷紀錄，兹特列表如下：</p>

<p>（註）（一）凡平均數字係各該産區繭行收量總值統扯而得。</p>
<p>（二）價值各地不同，此由繭質優劣，繅折大小而定。</p>
<p>試觀上表，各地繭價，連年瀉降，成直下跌綫，姑就無錫改良種繭而言，十九年最高達一二○元，二十年尚有九五元之紀錄，而今年最高僅四○元，爲十九年高價之三分之一。若與其他各區比較，此尚占優越地位，（努力從事蠶種改進，究不徒然辛勞。）杭紹等處之平均價格，竟入二○元之内，寗非驚人現象。考蠶收贏虧，向爲江浙農民一歲出入所賴，整個農村經濟所繫，今如此種遭遇，要求農村不崩潰者，其可得乎。</p>
<p>成本雖輕尚須虧蝕</p>
<p>照上所述，繭價奇廉，絲本自低，繅絲廠商，宜乎有利可占，可是不景氣之流行，猶如烈日當空，大地普蒙炎威。最近絲銷清淡市價猛跌，廠商所感痛苦，一如蠶農，或且較厲。兹將最近絲價與往年比較，列表如下：</p>
<p>十九年（價單位兩）　二十一年（價單位兩）　二十三年（一月至七月價單位元）</p>
<p>等級　條份匀度　價格　最高　最低　最高　最低　最高　最低</p>
<p>Ａ字　１３２２　８５　一、二五０　九００　八五０　六００　七八０　六四０</p>
<p>Ｂ字　１３２２　８０　一、一五０　八八０　八一０　五四０　五００　四二０</p>
<p>Ｃ字　１３２２　７５　一、０五０　七七０　七八０　五一０　四八０　四００</p>
<p>註（一）本表價格係根據某絲廠累年售價並參照市况估計而得，Ａ字等級價格獨高者係指某廠超等出品之售價而列入。惟産量甚少，交易亦稀。</p>
<p>（二）本年價單位係（元）上兩項係（兩）蓋當時尚未廢兩，爲求凖確，故仍用之。</p>
<p>目下上海廠絲，能合Ａ字等級者，幾如鳳毛麟角，蓋其成品條件，須有雄厚資本，科學設備，合理管理，優良工作，始克臻此。要求適合此種條件之絲廠，上海方面，恐一家而不可得。類均因陋就簡，毫無遠大目光對外競爭意義存於其間，中國絲業之不得爭强於國際市塲者，此又主因之一。是以市上買賣，ＢＣ兩級，最較普通。觀於上表，十九年Ｂ字廠絲最高爲一，一五○兩，惟最低達八八○兩，可知絲價從該年已呈巨差跌率，該年絲廠即起恐慌，請求政府發行公債，以圖挽救。聲浪所激，翌年果得批准頒發公債八百萬元，以四分之一，改良蠶桑；四分之一，改進絲廠設備；四分之二，發給江浙絲廠，實施救濟。上海各廠，當然亦潤其惠，勉渡難關。至二十一年，經一二八之打擊，絲廠益陷於艱險地位，市價跌至五百四十兩，銷滯貨積，無法週轉，廠商乃有公債之請求，政府關心實業，亦如所請，辦理陳絲陳繭登記，奬勵出口生絲每擔銀百元，並免徵關稅，至去春始竣其事，論其結果，不過療飢一時，無裨整個絲業之發展。洎乎最近，Ｂ字絲價已逼撲四百元關頭，尚屬有行無市，前途之暗礁殊多。</p>
<p>吾人試以無錫繭計算成本，據調查：每擔絲須需乾繭四百二十斤，值銀四百六十三元，再加工脚約八十元，除下脚（指繅絲廢餘或不能繅絲部份）副産收入約四十七元外，每擔生絲凈本計四百九十六元之　，縱能繅製上身廠經，已决難占其利：若用杭紹等繭，表面上，繭價似較低廉，但其繭質中平，繅折較大，祇能繅製ＢＣ等級，成本至少須四百五六十元，依照上表市價，粗疏估計，每擔須虧五十元矣。最近絲廠漸形不支，呼籲之聲，甚囂塵上，此豈偶然哉？</p>
<p>總之，世界經濟恐慌，方興未艾，百業蕭條，互爲因果，使一般購買力極度萎减，商品均感過剩，生絲豈能例外？是以世界恐慌一日不去，絲銷即一日難望轉暢。要謀絲業復興，就似同夢想。難然世界恐慌終有平靜之日，中國絲業若不從科學化，合理化，國際化，入手改造，則殊乏繁榮之希望！</p>

<p>最近報上載着兩件遥相暉映的紀事，一是濟南市當局的殺犬，一是上海保護動物會的護犬；雖均事屬拾零，無關宏旨，然而究屬生死的事，不妨那來一談，據濟南通信，該市野犬素多，到處充斥，不特狂吠狺狺，厭人聽聞，且時有瘋犬發現，於市民安全，亦大有關係，市府有鑒於此，特請准省府主席，於七月十一日，將犬牢積存之野犬二千餘頭，押赴千佛山下，執行槍决。而上海之中國保護動物會，以法租界近又捕捉野犬，狀甚慘忍、特開會議决派人前往調查，以龍華原有豢養野犬所一處，久已廢辦，亟應恢復收養，以重物命。</p>
<p>狗，這一名詞常常會使人感到其他類似的東西去，不過被槍斃者僅爲野狗，這就呌人有些不平，因爲旣成爲狗，總無人性可言，牠們總是護衛主人，向别人狺狺而噬。而且正當紅運的家狗，更其使人厭惡、專恃主人的威風，「抱着門閂惡」，偶一不愼，便有被牠咬去一塊肉的危險。至其恣情肆虐，逞威驕傲，不可一世之慨，非僅使人「側目」，而且「殊堪髮指」。是以可殺者，非獨野犬而已。</p>
<p>至於保護動物會的反對捕殺野犬，固本乎惻隱之心，所謂「天有好生之德」；然而這種舉措，亦是「明定以察秋毫而不見輿薪」，因爲「動物」之被捕殺者，除野犬而外，六蓄家禽等等，可說數不勝數。何以野犬獨得特别待遇，而牛馬等等的大蓄生，反未蒙此種恩典，旣屬不解，關心物命而至於禽獸的野犬，慈悲固慈悲矣，仁愛固仁愛矣；可是我們一讀孟子「今恩足以及禽獸而功不及於百姓者」的話，眞是令人拜服，因爲他的說話，很有分寸，何怪其又得吃冷肉也。</p>
<p>從濟南野狗被殺的事件中，也許不少的家狗要表示高興，其實不要得意忘形，家狗有時也有被殺之虞。不聞我國古語：「飛鳥盡良弓藏，野兎死走狗烹」。就是六月三十，德國希特勒得以奪得政權的挺進隊，也有不少領袖遭「卓别林鬍子」的殺戮，雖然他們不是狗是人，然而總是動物。</p>
<h3>蝗災</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>農村裏的人民太苦了；旣受兵燹匪禍之慘，復遭外患内憂之痛，最近幾年以來，又加之天災人禍的相煎相迫，這種遭遇，眞要使一般農民們有欲哭無涙之慨了丨</p>
<p>今年江南各省，入夏以後，卽遭旱魃肆謔；然而跟着旱荒之後，又來了一個蝗災。</p>
<p>在一天的下午，約莫是四點鐘的時候：不知從那裏飛來一羣蝗虫，漫天蔽空的不知有幾百千萬，呼呼的聲音，彷彿在發大風似的，當時太陽也給遮没了，好像要下雷雨的樣子。</p>
<p>「媽！看吓！那裏來的許多大蚱蜢啊！」那些小孩子們，都這樣歡躍的喊着。</p>
<p>「小狗了！這是蝗虫，你不要去驚動了蝗神老爺，快快跪下去拜，求牠不要到吾們田裏去；蝗虫是要吃稻的，要是吾們的稻給牠吃去了，那你就是餓肚了啦！」一個中年婦人很躭心的叮囑她的兒子小狗子。她自已却也雙手合十的在禱告些什麽，面上顯出很驚慌的神情，彷彿有一塊重量的巨石壓進了她的心頭。</p>
<p>無知的小孩子，聽了娘的話，果眞跪下去拜了；小嘴裏只喃喃地在吟着：</p>
<p>「蝗神老爺，你不要到吾們田裏去，求你。」</p>
<p>但是，蝗神老爺，並不會接受他們或她們這誠懇的祈求，而終於從空中降落，像雨點子般的降在每一片田裏！</p>
<p>於是，慘苦與惶恐，又攻上了每一個農民的心頭，眼看得許多辛辛苦苦種活的禾苗，没得給乾死，而倒喂給蝗虫去吃掉了。</p>
<p>「阿狗爸！快去請香燭，好到田邊去求蝗神老爺；萬一把吾們的稻吃去了爲吾們一家一年的食糧不着落不必說，可是租米糧錢還是少不了半個的……」阿狗媽也担憂着她們的稻，恐怕蝗神老爺來光顧。</p>
<p>「金生嫂！你香燭預備好了没有，還不快去燒吓，遲一點給牠吃完了才糟糕呢！」王家阿婆，自已倒很鎭靜，而偏生會替别人着起急來。</p>
<p>「現在人心太壞了，所以老天爺要罰你們百姓受些災難，你看現在眞是男不像男，女不像女，還成一個什麽樣的世界？將來也許眞要到有米無人吃，有路無人走，有屋無人住的時候才會太平啦！」王三阿爹，好像有先知之明似的發表他的言論。</p>
<p>香，燭，元寶，在每一塊的田傍焚燒，灰白的濃烟，只冉冉的上昇，許多道的烟頭飛到了空中，凑合攏來，便化成了一層白迷迷的濃霧，農人們的心，也同樣地在熱血裏沸煎，把幾千百顆血赤赤的心，都煎在一處。</p>
<p>從日到夜，從天黑到天明，蝗虫却散佈滿了每一片的田裏，没有飛去。農民們也實在没有法想了；求蝗神老爺是無効，還是去求當地的佛爺。於是城隍廟，土地庵，猛將堂裏都擠滿了香客；繚繞的香烟，輝煌的紅燭，燒得得廟裏烟霧騰騰的，佛龕前的拜墊上，跪滿了請願的善衆，頭是像搗蒜一般的叩着。</p>
<p>最後，又經多數農民的集議，由鄕長領頭發起，請猛將出巡到各處田間去實行赶蝗工作。</p>
<p>第二天的一早，許多鄕民都到了猛將堂裏，把一位泥塑木雕的猛將老爺，恭恭敬敬的請了出來；同時，還帶了一位土地，用神轎抬了往田間裏去巡禮，所到的地方，有香燭在地上揷着元寶，在地上燒着，也有不少人跪在自已的田傍膜拜，情形是可憐亦復可笑。</p>
<p>到了將近黃昏的時候，趕蝗的工作</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>總算功成完滿，土地回了宫，猛將也歸了座。農民們一天的疲勞丨也許可說是興奮丨到了晚來，便都在床上呼呼地睡去了。等到第二天天纔微明，他們便奔到自已的田裏去看蝗虫有没有赶走。</p>
<p>眞的，蝗虫是全飛去了，可是，禾苗也全飛去了，怎麽辦？</p>
<p>「完了，一切完了！吾們辛辛苦苦的幾天夜没睡没吃，忙着開港戽水，纔把許多禾苗，從旱魃手中救得轉來，滿想今年秋收多少有些希望，誰知會給蝗虫吃掉，吾們眞是命不該活了！」那些農民，都在你望着吾，吾看你的嘆息着，幾十道帶着失望的悲哀的目光，都凝聚在給吃光了的禾苗莖上。</p>
<h3>搶飯</h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>癩痢頭兒的李阿五，高大的身子，粗肐膞兩條鐵，骨鎚似的毛腿，力氣又大，走道兒怪神氣的，係隻野水牛。有這麽一副硬朗的身子，和結實的力氣，却幹着那麽頂没出息的事體。自家亦摸不清的，空着手，不能空着肚子，呌他不幹幹什麽過活呢。從這口人家吃賸的冷飯是不知多少日子了。</p>
<p>他吃人家的賸飯，但還有吃他賸飯的賸飯的。</p>
<p>雖然是賸飯，吃的人是太多了，就是吃賸飯亦是不易的。可是癩痢頭兒李阿五有的是力氣，兩條勁毛腿。因此在夥伴們中間他成了一條好漢了，吵起架來，一個擋得住十個，祗敎讓他輕輕揍一下，踢一脚，就會痛上背脊根那兒，一直痛上了幾夜的。而且狗脾氣够壞，一點不對勁，便瞅着人家的脖打起來，這麽着誰個不怕他。</p>
<p>每天，在各處吊兒哴噹，一到了時候，他便來站在這紙舖子的門外邊。等着，送飯的人挑着担子來收回東西的時候，他的黑小布袋子立刻便裝滿了冷飯賸菜。他走到旁邊僻靜的弄堂裏邊，大口嚥嚼着，愉快地，餘下來的，就分給其他的小夥伴。</p>
<p>好些日子都是這樣過去的，癩痢頭兒李阿五吃疋紙　子這口賸飯。夥伴們差不多没人不知了。也没有人願想來佔他的地位，爭這口飯。固爲他的粗肐膞，勁毛腿是出名的。</p>
<p>可是車情忽然變了，好幾天李阿五遲來一點，飯老是給别人先帶走。可遲不過，他不相信有這麽大胆子的傢伙來覷他這一口吃定的飯。</p>
<p>就在那天晚上丨李阿五特地很早便站在紙舖子門口等着。看是誰個帶走他的飯。接着果然來了兩個壯小夥子，亦巴巴的停在門邊來。李阿五一下子眞煞不住，便獰着眼睛問：</p>
<p>「喂，小豬玀，站在這里幹啥的？」</p>
<p>那兩個係是從别地方來的，不知道李阿五是誰，同聲地答！「等飯吃。」帶着幾分乾脆而强硬的口調。</p>
<p>一聽，李阿五怒火馬上打穿腦蓋，這氣從來没嘔過的，怎麽受得了。於是他一壁揑起了碗口股大的拳頭，一壁迫近前去，尖着銳利的嗓子，叱着：</p>
<p>「好小子，眼睛生在後腦袋。等飯吃，可瞧見老子的拳頭？」</p>
<p>然而那兩個的臉上並不曾露出點兒畏懼的表情，亦没有離開那兒的意思，儘管瞥着李阿五，不動也不出聲兒。</p>
<p>看那模樣，使李阿五再也無從按捺，他不動手簡直是跨了指的。這麽着，他把上身摇了幾摇，渾身一使勁，對準那個的胸脯，猛可地，一古腦，兒打了過去，又騰出左脚使力望小腹那兒一踢，那小夥子没提防，隨卽走了幾步，撲通一聲倒了。</p>
<p>另一個看不對勁兒，於卽一跨腿跑開。倒在地上的那個嘴裏咕嚕地駡着，掙扎了好半天才爬起來。</p>
<p>等到紅頭阿三冲上來的時候，李阿五早就騰着兩條毛腿子，飛快的溜没了。被他打跌的那小夥子還吃了阿三幾根沉重的棍子兒，才倒霉呢。</p>
<h3>廢話連篇</h3>

<p>有飯吃的人，常常不想吃飯；常常想要吃飯的人，他偏是没得飯吃。</p>
<p>古時有一個皇帝聽說某地方的人饑饉没有飯吃，他說；怎麽不吃肉縻呢？</p>
<p>有飯吃的人，不相信人家一定要吃飯。因爲他時常感覺得一天三餐飯眞討厭。</p>
<p>没有錢的人不愛惜用錢，在化錢的人也不愛惜用錢，視錢如命的是有錢的人。</p>
<p>在做工的人不勸人家去做工，勸人家去做工的人，他不做工。</p>
<p>天下最不相信上帝的，就是勸人家信上帝的人。</p>
<p>和尚是四大皆空的人，可是爲了廟産他們却要打官司。</p>
<p>時代一發展到現在，神父牧師和尚尼姑都變成了職業的一種，上帝和神佛在天堂上不知道覺得樣怎？</p>

<p>敎徒們現在自已已經打倒宗敎了。然而，活佛還時髦。這大概是因爲他是活的。</p>
<h3>姐兒作家</h3>
<p>— 王慈</p>
<p>前作「哥兒作家」有人謂余曰：「旣有「哥兒作家」，何無「姐兒作家」？」語雖近於「語妙」，惟吾儕屁股坐在筆尖上的可憐文人，能無雀躍於懷，以爲題材之堪取也！因作是篇，以博下月之哈德門資。</p>
<p>時間從上午溜到了下午，噹噹十二點啦。</p>
<p>姐兒作家剛送了ＸＸ雜誌社的編輯先生出去，笑靨深得足够放一個指頭進去，揑揑剛纔被編輯先生緊握過的手掌，彷彿還被熱烈的手掌緊壓得發生着一種異樣的感覺，輕燕似地回過蛇似的腰肢：</p>
<p>「張媽丨張媽！來，來，來。」</p>
<p>那被稱爲張媽的是一個娘姨型的矮大胖子，顫顫巍巍地跑上來，臉兒和善得像堆着一大簇薔薇花：</p>
<p>「小姐，好小姐，有什麽事吩咐？」</p>
<p>姐兒作家扭轉了頭，長長地思索了一番，想不出什麽事來：</p>
<p>「啊呀丨一下子什麽事情多忘記啦！」</p>
<p>姐兒作家笑，張媽也跟着笑。</p>
<p>姐兒作家一扭身走進自已的書房。</p>
<p>那是够富麗的丨丨</p>
<p>坐上轉椅，又記起了一件事：</p>
<p>「張媽張媽，把郵差送來的信去拿來。」</p>
<p>一會兒，張媽又顫顫巍巍地捧了一大疊信件來。</p>
<p>這疊信够有二吋厚：粉紅的嫩綠的，淡黃的，大的，小的……</p>
<p>姐兒作家授過來，輕輕地嗔道：</p>
<p>「討厭！這末多的信！」</p>
<p>第一信是嫩綠的，揭開來，一張銀色花紋的信箋：</p>
<p>親愛的：</p>
<p>昨天的來信，已經收到了，謝謝您，我眞感激您能够在百忙中寫信給我，親愛的，您呌我做的那篇小說：「寂寞的花」，現在已經脫稿了，現在奉上，望您替我好好地削改一下子……</p>
<p>姐兒作家看到這裏，再不看下去，把那篇「寂寞的花」檢起來，在題目下輕快地簽了名：「ＸＸ女士」，再摺起來，套了信封，在信封上潦潦草草地寫了一堆字，又喊道：</p>
<p>「張媽！」</p>
<p>候在門口的張媽已站在姐兒作家的面前。</p>
<p>「把這封信呌阿三送到那個剛繼來過的Ｘ先生家去！」</p>
<p>張媽應了「是」，傳姐兒作家的命令去。</p>
<p>第二封信是粉紅的，揭開來，是ＸＸ月刋的文藝欄編輯先生的：</p>
<p>ＸＸ女士，不，可敬的天才詩人：</p>
<p>這次的ＸＸ月刋倘使不見慾的詩，那是要使讀者多麽地失望呢……</p>
<p>姐兒作家當然也不看完這封信，把它放在一邊：從新檢起另一封信來，剖了肚，挖出了一篇詩稿：「我終有一天丨丨」</p>
<p>無疑地，姐兒作家又在下面簽了「ＸＸ女士」的名，剛要套進另一個信封裏，不知怎地又縮了回來，破天荒地一行一行地讀下去：</p>
<p>我終有一天要揪住您的纖腰，把您的纖腰猛可地一把抱牢；要是您不是輕輕地說一聲「好」，小姐我死也不願意把您放掉。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>我終有一天要揪住您的纖腰；把您的纖腰猛可地一把抱牢；您嗔着輕輕地打我一下也好，您嗔着悄悄地駡我一聲也好！</p>
<h3>憶汴梁和平巷</h3>
<p>— 洋洋</p>
<p>「暖風薰得遊人醉，直把杭州當汴州，」</p>
<p>這是古詩人讚美「汴梁城」的吟哦。換句話說：就是人們本在杭州遊玩，因爲被暖風薰醉了他們的心靈，腦中印象忽然活動起來，觸悵前塵，便疑惑寄身於杭州咧！同時我們也可以知道「汴京」的風光，并不亞於美麗之「西子湖如其不然，中國各地方，够得上稱作「風景區」的很多很多，何以單獨要提出汴州和杭州作一對照比較呢？」</p>
<p>現在正是暖風薰人欲醉之時，我於眼前物景，不禁興感舊遊，聯想到汴梁，眞有些不堪回首！汴州在我中華領土上，原屬於河南省，今名開封。北宋時代，曾經建過都，的確是一座名勝古城。牠和現代革命政府所規劃之西京丨陪都丨洛陽，并立於京漢鐵路汴洛支綫上，同樣的因地制宜；大大出名，而具有歷史價值。記得國難岌岌，一二八抗日之役，淞滬浴血大戰，吃緊關頭，政府爲着未雨綢繆起見，曾經將國府搬家，搬到洛陽，枯寂多年的汴梁，因爲隣封洛陽一旦市面繁榮起來，影響所及，牠居然也間接跟着烟霧交加，熱閙得出人意外。</p>
<p>旗袍袒胸，高跟赤腿，纖眉入鬢，厚施脂粉，一切摩登化打扮，我敢說：在國府没有搬家到洛陽之前，不特開封一隅，就是全河南省的娘兒們，祗要是土著，無論良家，無論娼妓，簡直尋找不出。結果，「洛陽女兒，」和汴梁姊妹們多受了外來官太太的流風餘韵，就中尤其要數開封城裏的和平巷，蓑燕語鶯啼，紅紅綠綠，迎來送往，箏琵筆管，澈夜不絶，牠的旖旎風光，竟和北平八大胡同，天津三不管，有同樣引誘遊人的魔力。和平巷俗名第四巷，巷内另有岔枝小胡同四條。在河南省尚未實行禁娼之前，事實告訴我們說；開封和平巷計有妓寮七八十家，每家約有妓女六七人，或五六人不等，平均計算，總在五百人左右，至於狎客冶游的手續，也與平津間大同小異。若要眞個銷魂，却用不着打牌擺酒等等過分之消費，祇須拿出十五元纒頭代價，卽可入幕喚卿卿了。茶圍是一塊大洋，呌條子加倍，直截了當，痛快異常。本來娼家是解决性慾的集團，爲世界人類所公認的，何必多般張致，百樣裝腔，什麽「賣藝不賣身？」那都是掩耳盜鈴，自欺欺人，不過要實行其「銷金主義」罷了！</p>
<p>和平巷雖然是開封城娼窰的領域，但私娼充斥其間，實也不少。至於人的問題，研媸之分，却未必盡限於「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」之說。須知十步之内，豈無芳草，纔可容顔的汴洛女兒，儘多勝過「湖上西施。」</p>
<h3>粉面紅唇和翠眉</h3>
<p>— 洋洋</p>
<p>這就是摩登典型嗎？</p>
<p>太太奶奶小姐們，在將要出門之前，必得對鏡理裝，脚亂手忙，很起勁的張致一番。但是女子愛好天然，有的不是專爲着出去，才要打扮。往往無事家中坐，也必收拾得齊齊楚楚，甚至由朝至暮，不辭再三修飾，幾次更衣。而「晚妝樓上杏花殘」，「美人臨睡先臨鏡，」等等之描寫，艶句流傳，久爲世人所誦。可知女性之相沿習慣，鎭日閨中，不特在白晝，卽便晚間睡覺之時，也必須出落得如天仙化人。信有奇趣。</p>
<p>女人的粉面紅唇，其製造之艱難，及時間之破費，必不亞於劇塲後臺演「斬黃袍」去趙匡胤的主角。我嘗見一位亮晶晶的摩登之花，在她厚施脂粉工作之時，竟搽抹而滌洗，滌洗而搽抹，往返計至七次之多。據說：工作苟不如是之頻煩，那麽，根基必不能堅固持久；紅白也不能分明，苦心孤詣，足稱一代之搽抹脂粉的專家，偶爾思量起來，猶令我顚倒欽佩無已！</p>
<p>外國報上，曾經有過這樣一條新聞說：「巴黎現代婦女界，視爲美的典型，以化學和成綠色胭脂，塗在兩頰淺渦處，最爲流行。」如果此風不久移來東方，那麽，中國小姐的恩物，白粉紅脂，就要一齊下野咧！同時馬路上也要添加許多聳乳肥臂的青面虎。</p>
<p>再說現代的摩登眉毛，務必纖長入鬢，始足爲貴。然而「翠滴遠山，黛凝秋水」，也非天賦，全賴人工。我於此却又聯想到戲臺上之伶人，無論其爲生爲旦，爲花臉，爲凈角，在後臺未抹彩之前，第一件工作，則爲畫眉，如黃天覇之濃眉接鬢，推而至曹操嚴嵩司馬懿之流，白面刷眉，莫不各有特徵；各具作用。換句話說：就是分别代表其忠奸善惡，英武頑懦等等的個性。惟未知現代流行的「一綫眉」，究屬表示什麽象徵？說她妖嬈嫵媚吧？實也未必！</p>
<p>記得西計記上，讚美密絲崔的眉毛說：「宫樣眉兒新月偃，侵入鬢雲邊。「當日雙文小姐的畫眉法子，是否卽與今日的摩登眉，完全相同，或是小異？可惜無從揣想。還有那我家「阿敞哥」，他也是個畫眉毛的專家，然而同樣呌人興「前不及見古人」之嘆，眞是無可奈何！</p>

<h3>某夜（五）</h3>
<p>— 李懷瀛</p>
<p>孫太太接受了，唱了一段「孟姜女」，這調子，本來是不易使人快活的，反之倒容易令人沉入傷痛的境况中；她們的處境，和孟姜女有相像的地方，但孟姜女還能尋夫到長城邊，她們恐怕死也到不了新疆界上！唱第二段時，所有的人都哭了，她唱的聲音也變成沙啞的，又像是號呌的，終至在劉太太聲請停止之後，收拾了歌唱。劉太太緊接着長長地嘆了一聲：</p>
<p>「唉！丨丨」</p>
<p>屋中讓熱涙與低泣聲佔有着，死氣沉沉的。</p>
<p>她們想到在吉林退却時那一幕情形，到現在還要心悸不止的。日本兵，像虎狼一般凶，乘着軍用汽車，放射着機關槍在後面追，前後只差一里路遠，如果不是退到俄國界上，算不會再有性命了，是的，一定都要死在他們的手裏的。</p>
<p>但她們爲什麽不在那就死呢？那不是很光榮的一件事情麽，爲了抗日死在他們的槍下？時至如今，苟延殘喘過了二年多的日子，却要餓死在國人的面前了，她們，誰也没有料到這一步。這不是也讓人解說不出麽，說起來有些呌人通紅耳熱麽。</p>
<p>「喝酒！」</p>
<p>猛至喊了出來，邢太太三脚兩步地跑下樓梯去了。</p>
<p>這裏，她們不約而同地收束了眼涙、靜默地面面相覷。鄭太太抛出一個苦笑，隨卽閉上她的眼睛。劉太太起身開開適才讓她關上的窗子，轉回身，伸了一個懶腰。忽然間，她一連打了三個噴嚔，眼涙，鼻涕隨着就流出來了。</p>
<p>孫太太剛想摸取一本「二度梅」看看，這時停下手，笑着說：</p>
<p>「三百歲，劉太太不能餓死了！」</p>
<p>「千年王八萬年龜，人活得年歲大可不值錢。」</p>
<p>從打開的窗口，透進來少許凉的氣息，孩子們在外面玩閙吵呌聲顯得更大了。</p>
<p>孫太太劉太太這兩句有趣的話語，使得鄭太太睜開眼睛，還有寗太太，四個人一齊默哭着，一霎時，抛除了眼涙，都忘却了中心的憂傷。</p>
<p>笑一陣，哭一陣，樂一陣，憂一陣，她們只是在這中間打圈子，這一個晚上，她們是何等的矛盾。</p>
<p>樓梯一陣撲登撲登響着，邢太太抱着三大瓶白酒走進屋子裏，喘氣不止，檢紅紅的，冒出豆大的汗珠子，藍布衫的背脊上，濕透一大片汗水。她先把酒瓶子放在桌子上，隨後又從懷裏拿出一包花生未和一包油黃豆。</p>

<h3>一個好萊塢妻子的自供（中）</h3>
<p>— 密薺</p>
<p>做著名影星妻子的不易　欲知其究竟請君一細讀</p>
<p>雪爾維亞一見了託特，就開始大灌其米湯了。她說：「眞是想不到能和你相會。弗和蘭先生，現在我說句實話。「巴黎之夜」我連看了四次。我……老早就愛慕你了……在銀幕上……從你初登銀幕的時候……」她說話的神氣，可以說是盡極了狐媚的技能。我看了託特那種受寵若驚的神氣，我的心爲它冷了半截。當然，我亦不能怪他。像雪爾維亞那樣一個明星，肯這樣的恭維他，那當然不是等閒的事了。後來他們跳着舞。他們跳着舞的時候，雪爾維亞差不多要溶化在託特的身上了。她的額緊緊貼住了託特的臉。他們接連舞了兩個鐘頭。我不肯走……或者是虚榮心驅使的緣故吧。我不能讓這個女人一下子就完全勝利了。但是過了幾天，雪爾維亞竟和公司裏商量好了，下一次她拍的片子，就用託特做男主角。這亦是她當然必走的一着棋子。當他們拍片子的時候，我亦没有到攝影塲裏去。我盡心致力地布置我們的家室……亦儘量地打扮我自已……在受環境限制的可能範圍之内。我一星期到美容院去兩次，我儘量考究我的裝束，竭力地排遣着自已胸中的憂慮，忘記雪爾維亞是有生吞男子的名氣的。</p>
<p>「到了晚上，託特辛苦了一天，倦極而回來了。在那個時候，他將我擁抱在他的懷裏丨丨那時的好萊塢，接緊地要侵略到我們家室的和樂的，亦就被我們抛在九霄雲外了。忽然有這麽一天，我急於要和他商量一件事，電話打了半天打不通，於是我就自已跑到公司裏去。我一直往他的化妝室走過去，想在那裏等候他。我並没有想到先敲門。好了！我進去的時候，他和雪爾維亞兩個人在一塊。他們没有聽見我進來，但是我也不能退出去了。我好像是被我看見的景象釘住了我的脚了。我祇可以楞着儍看，我平日所認爲神聖的，現在一片一片的剥落傾倒了。她身上着的是白絲絨的衣服。她柔嫩的雙手緊緊捧住了他的頭，她的香唇死命的吸住了他的……他們最後如夢方醒的看見了我而然分開一。託特是神色張皇得很，但是雪爾維亞却滿不在乎似的說道：「弗利蘭夫人，請進來。我們正在試演下一幕的動作哩。現在的觀衆，眞是苛求得很，他們一定要表演得熱烈，和眞的一樣……」她說着還格格地笑個不休。在那一霎那間，我恨不得雙手扼住了她的喉嚨挼死她……</p>
<p>就在那天晚上，我們的孩子來了。託特大半夜陪伴着我，但是他明天一早就要出門去拍外景的。他一去，去了兩個禮拜。在那兩個星期之中，我除掉醫院裏冷酷的白墻之外，一些别的没有看見。我腦筋的幻想，就是在特爾蒙天的託特丨丨和雪爾維亞在一起丨丨好像看見他們兩個人在海邊上散着步，月色溶溶地將他們罩住了。那個時候，我又恨不得巴望我的男人，是個平常的男子，每天晚上從平常的公事房裏回來，談論着一天工作的瑣碎，帮助我决定着衣服的式樣，算計着金錢的合算不合算。過了幾天，託特回來了。他送了我一只一萬塊錢眞的，金鋼鑽和紅寶石鑲嵌的鐲子。拿出了我舊日七十五塊錢的訂婚戒指，哭了整整一夜。當然，這是託特所不知道的。我覺得倘使我能照常的堅持下去，事能自然會改善的。但是我現在想，天下不知道有多少婦人，還在迷戀着這個空想哩！（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「女人」丨丨大上海丨丨</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>的確，電影在中國，能够嚴肅的注意到婦女問題之討論，這不能不是進步的證明。然而每一個同一問題的影片，都不能作正確的解答，這是我們認爲遺憾的。那末我們對於這一「女人」的估價，在其内容方面說，該是怎樣的呢？</p>
<p>我們决不會忽視作者史東山對於問題的處理之熱情，他大聲疾呼的說：中國婦女雖然經過幾次的解放門爭，但是直到現在爲止，這經濟的，政治的，看不見的鐵練，仍然在牢牢的束縛住她們，使她們仍然在痛苦中挣扎。於是她在字幕中說：「她們假使不致力於社會革新運動，什麽自由解放，都是空話。」這，無論如何是比較正確的指示。</p>
<p>但是，作者在作品中並没有把握住問題的中心。電影藝術是藉形象而思維的，由於畫面所給與我們的認識，我們總覺得這一影片並没有指出正確的出路。很明顯的，這裏梁玉芬，王意芳，茉莉等，都是代表不覺悟女性之一面，而女醫生金玲知是代表已覺悟的女性了。這裏的一羣女性，都是小有産的出身，作者以其自身的經騐，對於梁玉芬一羣的生活的與思想的描寫，確是描畫得非常生動的。但是她在金玲身上所表現出來的解放運動是怎樣的呢？很明白的，由於他不能有深切的社會認識，於是在女醫生金玲並没有表現出婦女解放運動者眞實的恣態。關於她，作者很注意的描寫了她的思想和行動，她不滿於校長不准舞女讀書，她所能做到的只是憤然的自動離校，她鼓勵丈夫到東北去從事救護，甚至於說敎丈夫於必要時肩起槍桿來，民衆自已來收復失地，她也爲女工們診病，然而不知怎麽的，在她身上總使人覺得很生疎，没有充分之眞實感，似乎在有些地方是空想的英雄，結果她並没有最積極而正確的行動表示，最後也無非是看到梁玉芬生命的悲哀而流下幾點同情之涙。假使在她身上給與人們一種反感，那眞是作者所意想不到的損失了。</p>
<p>在整個的作品上看來，作者對於一般的小有産者的婦人之通病，確是描寫得很好的。梁玉芬的一生，便是極好的例證。戀愛，結婚，生孩了，在這長長的過程中，她們受盡了生理的以及經濟的政治的壓迫，半殖民地的中國在帝國主義和封建勢力之下所反映到一部份婦女中來的慘酷的種種，作者都寫得很爲精細。然而她們之間悲劇的造成，從梁玉芬方面，並没有芒出其必然的原因，最明白的夫壻的不良以至於墮落，小孩的失火以至於玉芬的自殺，都是比較偶然的而不是一般的題材。假使洪小亭是一個循規蹈矩的青年，她不是還可以過去嗎？特别是後者，那一塲失火没有在主題上嚴密的展開，結果那唯一的Ｃlimax不能敎人們發生聯想，而祗是偶然的不幸罷了。結果是給與我們空虚而略帶傷感的剌戟，没有明確的概念然而我們認爲這一影片所以不能完美的原因，主要的是没有將這一羣的解放和勞働婦女運動合流起來。這一方面是環境關係，而另一方面也許是作者的體念不足。</p>
<p>其次，關於其他技術問題方面，還有不少是值得提出和作者商榷的地方：（一）小亭和他的家庭關係，不甚明白。母親能私匯三百元給他，但以後他却不會在潦倒時，求助於家庭。（二）玉芬發現丈夫之秘密，接着没有下文，結果這一塲釘梢等於不必要的。（三）玉芬不捨得質當結婚戒指，以一件舊衣代之，這不是極容易看懂的，假使當時很快回想給婚時的熱閙，那就好了。（四）「床頭金盡的時間性，似不甚妥，那一串金鎖不够使用多久。（五）雷夢娜前是玉芬的同學，後來的女相士也是她，前後是否一人？（六）父親在旅館中看見女兒的時候，那摇鏡頭應快一點才好。（七）小亭買洋囡囡來到醫師家以前，没有促進高潮，而在時間性上也覺不合。（八）小亭抱洋娃娃給與死孩子的時候，Ｔcmpo，太慢。</p>
<p>然而總括的說，這一影片一般的說是中國影片中傑出的作品，也是作者到現在爲止的代表作。許多地方，表現出他的優秀和聰慧，再加上攝影表演等都甚佳妙，我們認爲它是壓倒了以前以婦女解放爲主題的諸作品了。</p>
<h3>最難再聽燕呢喃</h3>
<p>美麗的小燕曾經呢喃過一點兒之後就一直緘默到現在。幕前的觀衆對於她的繞樑三日的歌聲，清逸温柔的吐囑是何等地在渴望着再聆一遍啊！機會來了。她主演的聯華本年度鉅片「大路」已經决定了全部配音歌唱，除了題材歌之外，孫瑜導演還擬特地編一首歌給她謳唱。據說這是一首情切切意綿綿的情歌，音調之美，詞句之佳，有曠古絶今之概。那未給努力學習了歌唱一年多的陳燕燕唾球咳玉地唱起來，將來一曲風行又是一是意中之事呢。</p>

<h3>佳兒佳婦（ＢorntobeKissed）（八）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>潘其回過去，笑容可掬地對着湯姆道：「兒子，你有什麽話說呢？」憶迪看了那種神氣，露着驚慌失措的神情，自言自語道：「兒子！」湯姆笑道：「爸爸，我恐怕祇可以先儘你了。」潘其駡道：「你這小……」他說了就走開了，讓湯姆去繼續他的瘋狂舉動。他們這樣糾纒着，玩要着。憶迪偶一不愼，竟滾過了欄杆，掉在水裏去了。湯姆喊道：「你等着我，我們一同游回家裏去吧。」大家都爬在欄杆上，往下看着。鐵康參議員慌張着道：「好像這個小姐快不興了，要第二次沉下去了。」祗聽見湯姆又喊了一聲：「憶迪！」就將身一躐，跳過欄杆，揷進水裏去。他到了水裏，一把拉住了她，抱持着她游到岸上去了。</p>
<p>從那天起，一天一天的光隂，很迅速地過去，好似一個甜蜜的夢。憶迪已是和湯姆掉在愛情裏了。她自已是明白的，但是她却儘力壓制着她自已。她儘力地不使湯姆接近她。她儘力地拒絶接受那副金鋼鑽的鐲子，湯姆爲她買的。她不想嫁給他丨她定凖了。她要遵着她原有的目標做去。她時常看着那隻克新斯送給她的綠寶石做的戒指。她深信他的話，肯和她結婚的。湯姆有一天帶了憶迪到使館俱樂部去。潘其和他的賓客都到了，却利，統納和湯姆競爭着要博取憶迪的歡心。但是憶迪意志堅决得很。她立志要做一個「好女子」……好去嫁給一個百萬富翁……後來統納告訴憶迪，說潘其當夜就要入京去覲見總統，因爲他已被内定了要被派到倫敦去，出席軍縮會議，做美國的主席代表。憶迪聽了，好像那件事和她有密切的關係似的。她睜大了眼睛，好像眼見她自已已經做了什麽大使夫人，在英廷引見着去覲見皇后了……統納說定了，又說道：「就和你說，美麗的，你今晚跟我一同到北方去，來弄送湯姆下下。」憶迪很莊重的說道：「你去弄送你自已吧。我是一個好女子，你記住了。統納對着憶迪戀戀不舍的道：「你從前也是這樣告訴過我的。」憶迪道：「我現在再這樣告訴你一次。」</p>
<p>她看見湯姆了，他正和他的父親坐着隣近一張桌子上談話哩。她覺得潘其現在已經不大喜歡她了……她想一定是因爲湯姆的緣故。她就呌統納帶她到潘其的桌子去。潘其見了她，假裝着滿面笑容，歡迎着她。他正在勸湯姆，呌他和他一同到北方去，但是湯姆竟拒絶了。他知道那一定是因爲憶迪的緣故，他心想一定要設法對付這種環境。那或者要費掉幾個錢，但是倘使能够給他的兒子一個敎訓，使他了解像憶迪那樣的女子，到底有什麽目的，那末就是化它十萬八萬塊錢，亦不算多吧。他自已心裏盤算着，决定了，他就對着憶迪道：「這個地方湯姆帶你去四面看過没有？」憶迪道：「没有。」潘其道：「好吧」，我旣然没有法子使你們兩個人分開，你可以拿了你的東西，我來帶你們去看看。」憶迪答應了一聲：「好極了，」就和　其，湯姆一同走了出來。（未完）</p>

<h3>Water Mouth Bandits' Front and Rear Routes Have Been Cut Off</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chiang Ting-wen urgently telegraphed Chiang Po-cheng on the 5th, summoning him back to Fujian to discuss strategies for suppressing the bandits. Chiang met with Chen Jitang at noon to bid farewell and is scheduled to leave Guangzhou on the 6th. The 1st and 2nd columns, led by generals Yu Hanmou and Li Yangjing, etc., stationed in the province, are scheduled to return to their defense positions on the 7th due to the Fujian bandits' counterattack. Yang Dezhao arrived in the province on the 5th and plans to go to Jiangxi with Li Shangyong on the 7th. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chiang Ting-wen telegraphed Chen Jitang on the 3rd, stating that two to three thousand remnant bandits were harassing the vicinity of Water Mouth, attempting to disrupt our rear. A certain division has been dispatched to attack from Yanping, and it should not be difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop, which will not affect our planned campaign. He also telegraphed Chiang Po-cheng on the 3rd, providing recent intelligence from this area: (1) The pseudo 79th Army Corps, led by Luo Binghui, is harassing Yong'an and Youxi, seemingly with the intention of infiltrating western Fujian; (2) There are 4,000 bandits north of Longyan, looting grain and wandering aimlessly, being pursued by Li Yannian. The pseudo 135th Army Corps was routed by our Tang column south of Baishui on the 22nd, and is now fleeing north of Shicheng. Over 700 bandits were killed in this battle. Investigations reveal that the purpose of this bandit incursion into eastern Fujian was to loot grain, and they did not have a single formal encounter with our army. They did not dare to attack our castles. Rumors of our army's defeat are entirely false. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Chairman Chiang telegraphed the military and political authorities of Fujian, ordering them to actively track down and suppress the remnant bandits in northern Fujian, not allowing any to escape. The bandits at Water Mouth now have their front and rear routes cut off. The provincial authorities have ordered all units to be responsible for strict suppression, and the remnant bandits will soon be wiped out. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>President Wang Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang alighted from the train at Heping Gate on the morning of the 5th and went to his private residence in the mausoleum area to rest. He told reporters at the station that he would be going to Lushan at the invitation of Chairman Chiang to address the military officer training corps. The exact date of departure depends on Chairman Chiang's arranging the order of the addresses and sending a follow-up telegram. It will likely be within this week. Whether Presidents Dai and Minister Kong will accompany him has not yet been decided. Chairman Huang Fu's attitude is not negative, and he will come down from the mountain in a few days to meet with me, either in Nanjing or Jiangxi. After finishing business in Jiangxi, he will return north immediately. The conflict between British and Japanese troops at Yuguan, arising from exercises, stems from differing views on the Boxer Protocol. Various parties are mediating, and it is hoped the situation will not escalate. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Reliable sources from Guling report that President Wang, Minister Kong, and others are scheduled to depart for the west on the 9th at the invitation of Chairman Chiang to address the officer training corps. After Wang and others arrive in Guling, they will take the opportunity to meet with Chiang to discuss everything. However, rumors of a conference are inaccurate. There is no definite news about when Huang Fu will come to Guling. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying Visits He</p>
<h3>Reports on His Trip South</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying visited He at Jurentang this afternoon to report on his visits to Wang and Chiang. He is scheduled to return to Zhangjiakou tomorrow morning. According to reports, his trip south to visit Wang and Chiang was to represent Song in reporting on the recent military and political situation in Chahar Province. After completing his mission, he is scheduled to return to Zhangjiakou on the 6th to report back. Chahar Province has suffered severe flooding, especially in areas such as Guyuan in eastern Chahar. The provincial government is seeking relief. Due to the heavy flooding, Japanese and puppet troops in eastern Chahar have been unable to garrison, so they have withdrawn. I have not received reports of bandits being discovered on the Chahar-Suiyuan border. The time of Huang's return north is unknown. However, while I was in Nanjing, I heard that Huang is scheduled to come down from Mogan Mountain around the 10th of this month to visit Chiang in Jiangxi to discuss matters related to North China. He will likely return to Beiping to take charge of the government after finishing his business. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng</p>
<h3>Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>Regarding Customs Suppression Matters at Various Ports</p>
<p>It is Necessary to Consult with the Customs Authorities</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng issued a written statement saying that today's newspapers carried reports regarding the sending of personnel by this office to suppress customs duties at various ports along the Great Wall, which do not conform to the facts. Since the Ministry of Finance decided to establish customs sub-cards at the five ports along the Great Wall, this office was ordered to supervise and direct the security forces within this region to assist in the suppression of customs duties. Moreover, with the rise of the green screen, security at the various ports along the Great Wall is quite uneasy, and it is imperative to find ways to maintain it. Therefore, yesterday, the commanders of the major security force detachments were summoned to this office to conduct preliminary discussions on concrete measures for the above two matters. These measures still need to undergo several rounds of discussion before a decision can be made. Even after a decision is made, matters such as customs duty suppression will still need to be consulted with the customs authorities. Therefore, at present, all selections of personnel, garrison locations, and numbers of people are still out of the question. The previous report that the National Economic Commission established an office in Beiping, and that I was the director, is also untrue. I am just recovering from an illness. Once my spirits are restored, I will go to Tianjin to request instructions on everything from the provincial government. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the establishment of checkpoints at various ports along the Great Wall, the heads of the checkpoints at each port will be announced once the order from the Ministry of Finance arrives in Beiping. The special agents stationed at each port office are responsible for suppressing smuggling. Xu Guanglin, the commander of the wartime security headquarters, came to Beiping a few days ago. On the morning of the 4th, a meeting was held at Yin Rugeng's residence to assign the proposed list of special agents for each port, and a general decision was made. A formal announcement will be made at an appropriate time. (5th)</p>
<p>Judicial Yuan Interpretation</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Filing Private Prosecutions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan yesterday ordered all high courts to interpret the restrictions on filing private prosecutions, stating that the consensus reached at the Uniform Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference is that implicated crimes refer to the same incident. In private prosecution cases, if they are indeed related to other implicated crimes that should be publicly prosecuted, then private prosecution cannot be initiated. If, after the first instance judgment on a crime under the jurisdiction of a primary court initiated by a private prosecutor, the second instance discovers that the formulation or outcome of the crime still involves crimes that should be publicly prosecuted and are under the jurisdiction of a local court, the original judgment should be revoked in accordance with Article 385, Paragraph 1, Article 379, and Article 318, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and a ruling of non-acceptance should be declared. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Stationed in Tanggu</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Conducts Street Fighting Exercises</h3>
<p>Japanese Army on the Beining Line Plans Large-Scale Exercises</p>
<p>Intended to Confront and Demonstrate Against British and French Troops</p>
<p>More Than a Thousand Japanese Troops Added at Yuguan</p>
<p>British Barracks in the South China Sea Under Strict Alert</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A large detachment of the Japanese army stationed in Tanggu began stacking sandbags and iron nets in the streets of Tanggu at 8:00 AM on the 4th to conduct street fighting exercises. They also dragged out two heavy artillery pieces and aimed them at a certain company's factory to practice firing, disrupting traffic. The Japanese army stationed along the Beining Railway plans to conduct large-scale exercises, with the duration determined by the duration of the British and French military exercises, seemingly intended to confront and demonstrate against the British and French troops. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the 2nd, the Japanese army has added more than a thousand troops at Yuguan, transferred from the garrisons in Suizhong and Jinzhou. They are stationed at the outer walls of the Great Wall, Dongluocheng, and the four coastal fort barracks in the South China Sea, preparing for long-term exercises. The British barracks in the South China Sea issued an order on the 4th, prohibiting certain people from passing through the cordon. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The British military authorities here stated today that the British military authorities have never heard of the report in a certain Chinese newspaper in Shanghai that British and Japanese naval soldiers had a serious conflict in Qinhuangdao. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the large-scale British military exercise at Shanhaiguan, the incident where a Japanese soldier accidentally fired a shot and injured a British soldier in a conflict has been investigated and found to be untrue. It was still the result of an erroneous report of a previous conflict between British and Japanese sailors in Qinhuangdao. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military attaché Chayama today denied the news reported in a certain Chinese newspaper in Shanghai that British and Japanese naval personnel had a serious conflict in Qinhuangdao. Military authorities on both the British and Japanese sides here have said they know nothing about this matter. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Approved by the Ministry of Railways</p>
<h3>Extension of Special Grain Transportation Rates</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways telegraphed the Shanghai-Nanjing and Nanjing-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus, approving the request to continue extending the special grain rates for another five months until the end of the year. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Plans Cold Storage</p>
<h3>Loan Has Not Yet Been Finalized</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways plans to handle refrigerated transport and cold storage warehouses, with the first phase to be carried out in Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangdong, Beiping, and Tianjin. The expenses require more than one million yuan. It is currently negotiating a loan with the banking sector, but it has not been finalized due to guarantee issues. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>After the Expansion of the Nanjing Municipal Area</p>
<h3>Four More Police Stations Will Be Added</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the boundary between the province and the city was demarcated, the urban area increased threefold. Sources in charge have reported that four police stations will be added, which will be submitted by the Ministry of Interior to the Executive Yuan for approval and will also need to be sent to the Central Political Conference for filing. Each station will have seven or eight substations, each with four hundred police officers. Each substation will have more than forty people. The cost of recruiting and training these police officers will be more than 500,000 yuan, and the recurring expenses will be 40,000 yuan per month. The new boundary areas, including the Yangtze River area, will also be under the jurisdiction of the Nanjing Municipality. Therefore, it is proposed to establish a Yangtze River water police team, whose jurisdiction will cover the area from Yanziji to Dashengguan, with 140 police officers stationed on the river surface. In addition to ordinary patrol boats, it is planned to borrow several small motorboats from the Navy Department for use. This plan requires a huge amount of funds, and it is not yet known whether it will be approved as originally proposed. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Northeast Agricultural Products</p>
<h3>Transported and Sold to Southern China</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Sources in the grain industry have reported that the South Manchuria Railway authorities, seeing that drought has developed along the Yangtze River and rice prices are soaring, will transport surplus agricultural products from the Northeast to the Yangtze River and southern China for sale at low prices. The Ministry of Commerce has sent personnel to Shanghai, Guangdong, and Fujian to discuss ordering soybeans, soybean cakes, sesame seeds, peanuts, and other goods. The Guangzhou Grain Association and Fuzhou rice merchants had previously established a 50,000-ton contract and sent representatives to Shanghai to liaise with representatives of the South Manchuria Railway office in Shanghai, and they have already returned to Dalian. This is the first time that Northeast specialties have been exported to southern China in general. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Drought Disaster Loss Statistics</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) This year's drought area extends throughout northern and southern China, covering 11 provinces and 129 counties. According to statistics from the Agricultural Experiment Institute, the losses from the disaster are no less than 2-300 million yuan. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Experiences Extremely Severe Drought</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) The provincial government has repeatedly received reports from various counties and districts that there has been no rain for four weeks. Not only are rice crops failing, but even vegetables are dying from the drought. More than 60 counties are reporting disasters in unison. Rice prices have risen to 11 yuan, a drought scene unprecedented in decades. The provincial government is taking control measures for grain. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Three Key Points for Encouraging Overseas Chinese to Invest in Their Homeland Ting</h3>
<p>People who have resided overseas for a slightly longer period often discover that even in remote and sparsely populated poor rural areas, there are overseas Chinese running small businesses. They may have been away from China for decades and have very little knowledge of news from their homeland. However, a sense of national consciousness remains deeply rooted in their hearts and can be revealed at any time. If you greet them in their native dialect, they will offer tea and cigarettes and talk to you very warmly. During the conversation, they may express that they are getting old and need to hurry back to their hometown while they are still healthy, so as not to spend their entire lives wandering overseas and becoming ghosts in a foreign land.</p>
<p>The simpler the overseas Chinese, the more they regard themselves as Chinese. If you falsely accuse them of being Japanese, they will take offense. Why is the national consciousness of overseas Chinese particularly profound? Probably, on the one hand, it is because they see the prosperity and development of their country of residence and feel that their own country is too disgraceful. They wish they could immediately "catch up" with others. On the other hand, it is because they suffer from harsh regulations and maltreatment in their country of residence. Without a strong government to rely on, they swallow their anger everywhere. They hope that one day they will be treated as human beings.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen said, "Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution." In fact, in addition to revolutionary causes, overseas Chinese have contributed significantly to charitable causes in their homeland. We dare to say that China owes the overseas Chinese, and the overseas Chinese certainly do not owe China.</p>
<p>The rewards for supporting revolutionary and charitable causes are, at most, a kind of spiritual comfort. Yet the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for "actively donating" is still so great. How much more enthusiastic would they be about investment ventures that offer both fame and fortune? Wouldn't they be even more passionate?</p>
<p>However, things must be turned around. In the past, there were countless scoundrels who pretended to establish factories and operate businesses in order to swindle money from the overseas Chinese community. The deceived overseas Chinese sacrificed their hard-earned money for nothing and only earned the nickname "fool." How can they not be disheartened? Therefore, we cannot seize the credit of the overseas Chinese and rashly ask them to invest in their homeland. The result will not be good, and we can only blame ourselves. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The domestic administration is not clean, bandits abound, excessive taxes are prevalent, and rural areas are bankrupt. As a result, inland capital is concentrated in a few major cities, leading to a morbid phenomenon of urban "congestion" and rural "anemia." Under such circumstances, where do we hope the overseas Chinese will invest? Investing in cities is not really necessary. Why bother? Investing in rural areas would inevitably turn them into "fools." We cannot bear to ask them to do that. We remember that in February of this year, overseas Chinese in Vietnam complained to the central government that overseas Chinese in the area could not maintain their businesses due to the heavy taxes imposed by the resident government. Several people decided to return to their homeland to invest and seek a living. Unexpectedly, they were extorted by corrupt officials in their hometown, who reported their purchased land as official property and seized it, leaving them with no way out, whether to advance or retreat. In addition, there are several other examples that can be cited at will. For example, overseas Chinese in Selangor organized an Asian inspection team to inspect the culture, transportation, and industry of their homeland in order to report to the compatriots in the area and invest domestically. One of the four members of the team was injured by bandits in Jiangxi. Also, Zeng Shangyuan, an overseas Chinese from Yangon who returned to his homeland, had accumulated a large amount of wealth. On the night of March 17, on the way from Xiamen to Gulangyu, he was kidnapped by bandits. When such news reaches the ears of overseas compatriots, how can they not be heartbroken and alarmed? If we hope people will invest, we must ensure the safety of capital. Otherwise, there is no way to talk about it at all. This is the second point.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, as of last year, there were a total of 113 types of harsh regulations by governments of various countries that mistreated overseas Chinese. Some were exploiting the freedom of overseas Chinese to reside, enter, exit, and travel. Others were restricting the rights of overseas Chinese to operate businesses, own property, marry, and receive education, etc. In the current economic downturn, with so many heavy shackles added, the difficulties faced by overseas Chinese can be imagined. Overseas Chinese use excessive hard work to earn money, but they are not divine geese that can lay golden eggs every day. If we hope they will come to their homeland to invest, we must at least make an effort to abolish several of their harsh regulations and cultivate some of their economic capabilities. Abolishing harsh regulations should start with diplomatic negotiations. Cultivating economic capabilities should focus on promoting domestic goods. We must do our best to make overseas Chinese merchants who promote domestic goods and do our best to give them the convenience of free development. Only by doing these two things can the economic capabilities of overseas Chinese be substantially restored, and only then can they have money to invest in their homeland. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Recently, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has been enthusiastically promoting the matter of encouraging overseas compatriots to return to their homeland to invest. The Executive Yuan has also long ago issued a notice to all provincial and municipal governments to effectively protect overseas Chinese who return to their homeland to invest. As long as the government is sincere and capable, the patriotic overseas Chinese will not disappoint us. We are willing to point out the above three key points in the hope that the government authorities will pay attention.</p>
<p>Near Yimianpo</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Demolish Railway Tracks</h3>
<p>Five Freight Cars Overturned</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain foreign merchant in Tianjin received a telegram from Harbin stating that at 3:00 AM on the 4th, a freight train departing from Harbin for Suifenhe derailed at a location 19 kilometers from Yimianpo because the railway tracks were demolished by guerrillas. Five freight cars overturned, disrupting traffic. In addition to sending troops to protect the repair of the tracks, the Japanese side also ordered the armored train of the puppet Chinese Eastern Railway to shuttle back and forth to prevent guerrilla activity. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) A train of Chinese Eastern Railway workers was destroyed by "bandits" near Yimianpo today. It is feared that all the people on the train have been abducted. After destroying the tracks, the "bandits" opened fire on a train traveling west 25 miles from Yimianpo, causing one locomotive and five train cars to derail. After hearing the alarm, troops rushed to the scene, but no trace of the train personnel was found, so it is feared that they have all been abducted. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet authorities of Liaoning Province announced that from May 1 to the present, they have captured a total of 9,200 guerrillas, a thousand more than last year. There have been 3782 robbery cases. The Japanese army has launched suppression campaigns and engaged with the guerrillas 1216 times.

<h3>Hebei Mines Occupied by Japanese</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Jixinglong Gold Mine in Hebei is being mined by the puppet state, which has established the Jixinglong Gold Mine Joint Stock Company. A team of Japanese soldiers is stationed at the mine. The directors and shareholders of the Hebei Gold Mine Company, which was previously organized by our side, have all been expelled. Several people have come to Tianjin to petition the Department of Industry to negotiate its recovery. When the mine was first established in early 1931, it produced 30,000 gold pieces per day, and the gold went to the puppet state. With the Japanese using machinery to mine, production has increased four to five times, and our losses are even greater. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Army Uprising in Andong</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Andong news, anti-Japanese army commander Li Chunguang recently, with the rise of the green screen, sent his subordinates Hao Jiandong and Guan Lingou back to the defense area in early July to incite the masses to launch an uprising. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese and puppet troops dispatched teams to block and intercept them in various places. On the 6th of last month, a conflict occurred with the Yan regiment of that unit at Chaoyanggang in Fengcheng, and the Japanese army suffered many casualties. On the 10th, another encounter battle was fought with the Ao division of that unit at Erdaoyanghe, repelling the Japanese army, killing the Japanese army captain Fujida and more than ten soldiers below him. That unit suffered 6 deaths and 4 injuries, and captured two Japanese horses and one supply vehicle. The Zhao regiment of that unit attacked the Japanese and puppet troops in the Youpanyong area of Andong with more than 100 soldiers. The Japanese army was having a meal and was attacked unprepared. The Japanese army fled in disarray. In this battle, four Japanese soldiers were killed, one Japanese army flag, four boxes of bullets, and many supplies were obtained. That unit is currently in contact with Ren Fuxiang of Xiuyan and is also taking in the remnants of Deng Tiemei, planning to capture Dagushan. It is feared that there will be fierce battles soon.

<p>PingSui Railway Plans to Invite the Press</p>
<h3>Inspect Full Line Losses</h3>
<p>Full Line Engineering Still Needs To Be Sorted Out</p>
<p>(Beiping) The foundation of each section of the Pingsui Railway that was destroyed by water has been difficult in practice. A bypass road has been constructed separately for each section, and temporary wooden bridges have been used for the rivers that have been passed to maintain traffic. After the flood recedes, the full line project will be reorganized, and another method will be devised. A plan is being prepared to be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval and compliance. In order to allow society to understand the truth about the losses caused by this flood on the railway, the Director of the Railway Bureau, Shen Chang, plans to invite the press in Pingjin to inspect the full line along the railway. He is currently seeking the consent of the relevant parties. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jin Tao, the chief of the engineering department of the Pingsui Railway Bureau, who was sent to the disaster area for inspection, returned to Beiping last night. According to reports, the roadbed and bridges between Pingdiquan and Taobqi on the Pingsui Railway were severely damaged in three consecutive floods. I was dispatched to supervise the surveying and mapping and to summon workers to repair them day and night. The entire line has now been restored to traffic. However, most of the original roadbeds have been washed away, and the newly built bypass roads are simple in construction and are only temporary. Most of the bridges are also temporarily supported by sleepers. The reason for the flood this time was that the Shibao on the Heihe tributary was damaged, causing the flood to overflow with great force. The damaged Shibao has now been repaired with cement. If there is no heavy rain in the next few days, there is no danger. Otherwise, the temporary projects along the line are in danger of being washed away again. A total of thirteen temporary bypass roads were built between Pingdiquan and Taobqi, and the roadbeds were temporarily padded. To protect the safety of passengers, the train is traveling a little slower. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Rumor That Xiao Ke Has Surrendered</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) The Red Bandits in western Jiangxi are on the verge of collapse. More than half of the five bandit companies at Qiaotou have fled and surrendered.

<h3>Han Fuqu Arrives in Qingdao</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Han Fuqu arrived in Qingdao by special train at 8:10 a.m. on the 5th, accompanied by Zhang Liansheng, Yao Yijia, Guo Zhigang, Ge Jinzhang, Han Duofeng, etc. Shen Honglie, Ge Guangting, Song Ziwen, Ye Gongchuo, and others all came to the station to welcome him. Han got off the train and went to the club with Shen, Song, and Ye for breakfast. Then, he went to his newly built private residence to rest. At 7 p.m., Shen hosted a banquet for Han, Song, Yan, Gu, Zhu, Ye, and other important figures at the Yingbin Hotel, inviting heads of various agencies to accompany them. Han said that his visit was purely to welcome Chairman Song to Jinan to conduct an on-site inspection of the Xia Qing River. The project is huge and requires a lot of funds, and he hopes that the central government will provide assistance to complete it. Shandong University's funding is difficult because the provincial treasury is tight and there are no surplus funds to allocate. Moreover, the school's atmosphere is not well-organized, and students who voluntarily participate in military training even complain about the heat and automatically return to Qingdao. The rest can be imagined. How many days he will stay in Qingdao depends on Song's intentions. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Li Shengwu, an external affairs advisor, came to Qingdao from Jinan on Wang Jingwei's order to meet with Han.

Han said that Shandong University's funding needs to be changed. Song Ziwen said that he could not decide whether to go to Jinan for the time being, because Jinan is hot and this place is cool, and he does not want to leave. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3>Details of the Jiaoji Railway Collision</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Ge Guangting said that the cause of the Jiaoji Railway accident was the stationmaster's negligence. The freight car was parked outside the standard pile, causing it to collide with the passenger car and derail. The two boxcars were too heavy and had to be dismantled before they could be lifted. A light rail has now been repaired and will be opened to traffic first. The injured foremen and firemen have been sent to the hospital for treatment.

<p>Exchange Opinions on Foreign Policy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Gu, the Counselor of the Embassy in Manchuria, arrived in Tokyo today with a reform plan for the Manchurian administrative structure. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to handle this case according to the following three principles: (1) The current structure is excessive and will be fundamentally reformed at an appropriate time; (2) Respect the status of "Manchukuo" as an independent country; (3) Break away from the partial positions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Military, and the Colonial Office, and reform from the overall situation of the country.

He will convene a meeting of envoys stationed abroad. Foreign Minister Hirota will explain Japan's foreign policy to them so that they can understand its true meaning. At the same time, they will exchange views on various issues related to China, Manchuria, Europe, and the United States. They will also review the strategies to be taken at the future naval conference. In order to break through the dangerous situation in 1935 and 1936, they must make the activities of overseas agencies more smooth and attempt to formulate concrete plans for compliance. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The regular reshuffle of the army has now come to an end, and the lineup of personnel in the central departments has been reorganized. Army Minister Hayashi is now preparing to step up efforts to enrich the national defense policy. He is determined to first solve the problems in Manchuria, and then strive to enrich the air force to complete his plan. Various issues concerning Manchuria have been formulated into a plan by the relevant authorities and submitted to the Army Minister. It is said that the outline is as follows: (1) Unification and strengthening of the organs stationed in Manchuria; (2) Abolition of extraterritoriality; (3) Return of the administrative rights of the Manchurian Railway's affiliated areas; (4) The issue of dual nationality of Japanese residents in Manchuria. Regarding the above issues, the army's fundamental policy is such that the Army Minister, in view of the solution of the Manchurian issue, should carefully consider the plan of the relevant authorities from the standpoint of guidance, and after determining a definite policy, he will begin to negotiate with Prime Minister Okada and other related cabinet members to find a solution. As for the enrichment of the air force, it is imperative due to the major international situation. All countries are expanding their air forces, so the army must also strive to establish a coping plan. However, the expansion of the air force must be based on the enrichment of military factories, operating soldiers, and machine soldiers. Due to the above relationship, the plan should be a continuous undertaking for four or five years. This enrichment method should also be implemented in Manchuria according to this policy.

<p>Japan's Unquenchable Ambition</p>
<h3>Promote British-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>Naval Issues Avoid Political Discussion</p>
<p>Japan's Negotiations Achieve Nothing</p>
<p>(Washington) The cooperation between Britain and the United States on various issues in the Far East has once again attracted much attention today. According to state officials, they have not heard of the rumors in Paris that British and American politicians have discussed naval and Far Eastern political issues. The naval authorities did not comment. Senior government naval and political authorities believe that this kind of news can prove that Britain and the United States have increased their sympathy for the uneasy state of the world. However, they all believe that it is difficult to have direct coordination between governments on various issues in the Far East, but they may be able to completely agree on major points from time to time. Some observers are convinced that at the naval preparatory meeting in mid-October, Britain and the United States will jointly oppose Japan's methods. Britain and the United States have also unanimously agreed to discuss political issues at next year's meeting, but Japan firmly opposes it and only allows discussion of naval issues. British and American diplomatic authorities believe that political issues are closely related to naval ratios, especially Japan's military actions on the Asian continent, which have made Britain and the United States pay more attention. Japan has been trying to have individual discussions with Britain and the United States for several months in order to gain separate understanding, but so far it has achieved nothing.

After he collects materials from European countries and returns to the country, he will draft the entire plan and submit it to Congress on February 1 next year. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>British Navy Week Begins</h3>
<p>Europe Returns to the Pre-War Situation</p>
<p>Former Naval Minister Strongly Advocates Enriching National Defense</p>
<p>(London) British National Navy Week opened today in Portsmouth Harbor. Former Naval Minister Lord Pete gave a speech on the inadequacy of British national defense equipment, stating that twenty years ago, our navy could still be used to capture Emden (a Prussian port, captured by the British Navy at the beginning of the Great War). Today, Britain has fewer cruisers than this number. Now is the time, we must release the shackles recognized in the London Treaty. The turmoil and unrest in Europe today are similar to those of twenty years ago, and the countries that make Europe turbulent and uneasy are also the same as those of twenty years ago. Judging from the events of the past week, if we are not careful, a small spark can cause the tragic calamity of a prairie fire to be seen again in Europe. Today, August 4, is the anniversary of the start of the Great War. We should be determined to do everything we can to prevent the recurrence of war. However, to prevent the recurrence of war, the way is to have a strong navy that can be used to maintain peace. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)</p>

Most of this new naval fund is for the construction of giant cruisers of 35,000 tons. The keels of the two cruisers have been set to be laid on July 1 next year, but the progress may still be stopped in advance due to international treaty relations.

<p>Roosevelt on His Way Back to Washington</p>
<h3>Inspects Giant Gate Project</h3>
<p>Strict Precautions Along the Way to Prevent Assassination</p>
<p>President Roosevelt inspected the Corrie Dam today by car. The dam is one of the government's great construction projects. About 3,000 residents there went to the dam project office to welcome him. Senator Deal introduced him to the President, saying that Roosevelt said that he is now building a new America so that the lives of all Americans can be richer. The President drove under the scorching sun and inspected the area for a week in a dusty path. He stopped briefly in Bananaville and spoke to workers and farmers, saying that the projects built there are permanent in nature and will be managed by the government in the future. He also said that most of the government's construction projects are on the Pacific coast, because the natural resources of the United States are concentrated there. In the future, people in the east can move to live there. There are too many people in the east now, and after moving west, life can be more prosperous. After the speech, the President set off east. He plans to take a brief tour of Glacier Park at the end of the week. While the President was here, an incident occurred. According to a report from the railroad flag-raising office, two people were seen placing a box of explosives between the tracks four days ago. Therefore, the local police carefully patrolled along the road until the President's car passed. The President will arrive at Glacier Park on Sunday morning and plans to stay overnight before leaving. At 10:30 a.m. that morning, he will give his first important speech after returning to the country, which will be broadcast nationwide by radio. The topic has not yet been announced.

<p>American Naval Base</p>
<h3>Overview of Honolulu Island</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>Military Honolulu is the gateway to the United States in the Pacific, 2,020 miles from San Francisco, and is the key point of transportation between the United States and the East, Australia, New Zealand, etc. It is also an important hub for wireless electricity, submarine electric silk, and commercial air routes connecting both sides of the Pacific. It is also an advanced naval base for the United States in the Pacific. Pearl Harbor, seven miles from the capital Honolulu, has a naval base built to ensure the defense of the American Pacific coast and the control of the Panama Canal. The strategic value of Honolulu will inevitably affect the American Honolulu policy, especially Japan's tough stance on next year's naval conference, which will have a significant impact on the American Honolulu policy. This is not difficult to predict. The US Army and Navy are working hard to gather the essence of modern science at Pearl Harbor to make it the "Gibraltar of the Pacific." Its permanent military equipment includes an infantry corps, two aviation teams, and a special division. There are also huge dry docks, fuel storage facilities of hundreds of thousands of tons, and ammunition depots. Last year's large-scale US naval exercise centered on Honolulu was a trial of Pacific warfare. In the previous year, the US House of Representatives proposed to appoint active army and navy generals as governors of Honolulu, which is also worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Industry The main industries in Honolulu are sugar, pineapple, and fisheries. Japanese advances are very significant, especially in the fishing industry, which is almost monopolized by the Japanese. The number of workers in sugar cane fields is currently oppressed by immigrants from the Philippine Islands, ranking second. However, in the approximately thirty years before ten years ago, the labor sector in this cane field was almost entirely dominated by the Japanese. Other rice crops, let alone, such as coffee, vegetables, and flowers, are all in the hands of the Japanese. (World News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Capture Deputy Stationmaster of Harbin</h3>
<p>The Reason is Unknown and the Russian Side is Quite Angry</p>
<p>(Harbin) In the past two months, trains on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway have been attacked by the Volunteer Army more than a dozen times. They are all Japanese military vehicles carrying guns, ammunition, explosives, and Japanese and puppet soldiers. The Japanese military has suffered huge losses and believes that Harbin has a Volunteer Army reconnaissance department. More than a dozen Chinese in Daoli and Daowai have been arrested in recent days. Suddenly, on the 3rd, Xiao Lun, the Russian deputy stationmaster of Harbin Station, was arrested and is now imprisoned in the Road Police Department. The reason is unknown and the Russian side is extremely angry. (China United Press dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3>Repercussions of Austrian Restoration Resurface</h3>
<p>Rome Plans to Convene a Meeting</p>
<p>Archduke of Austria Will Attend</p>
<p>Austrian Authorities Actively Purging Traitors</p>
<p>According to today's reports from Rome, an important meeting will be held in Rome in the coming days. It is rumored that Archduke Otto of the Austrian Imperial Family will travel to Rome after Italian Premier Mussolini reviews the naval maneuvers on August 10 to meet with the Italian Premier. It is also rumored that Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg will also attend the meeting. Members of the Austrian Imperial Family are greatly excited, believing that the Italian Premier holds a favorable attitude towards the restoration of the Austrian monarchy. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Vienna: The actions taken by Austria's new Chancellor Schuschnigg to purge the National Socialist Party rebels a few days ago are proceeding rapidly. What the Austrian authorities are investigating is not only judicial cases, but also political issues. The purpose is to truly prove Germany's involvement in this riot. All government agencies now hold this purpose, thoroughly researching various situations related to the riot. Those who will be severely punished by the authorities are: (1) traitors who participated in the riot, (2) responsible officials for whom the authorities have evidence of involvement in the conspiracy, and (3) important figures who are found by the police to have expressed sympathy for the rebel party. The first category refers to those who attacked government offices, and they will be tried by a military court this week. They were injured during the war, and the trial has been postponed until they recover. Many senior officials in the second category have been arrested, but the government will deal with the third category leniently. Thousands of civil servants have been dismissed because the government is now implementing disciplinary measures against those who express sympathy for the National Socialist Party. Public opinion believes that this riot did not receive public support, which shows that although the concept of National Socialist revolution in Austria has power in political and intellectual circles, it has not gained the sympathy of the people. Therefore, if the Austrian National Socialist movement is not incited by Germany, there is nothing to worry about in the future. However, if Germany encourages it, Austria will have to adopt more stringent measures to ban this movement. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Vienna: The "Vienna Daily" published a Berlin dispatch, stating that at a banquet held recently in Berlin by Austrian expatriates, Feoroenfeld, the former leader of the Vienna National Socialist Party and successor to Habicht as inspector of the Austrian National Socialist Party in Munich, presented an ultimatum demanding the continuation of the anti-Austrian movement. He said that if not, the Austrian guest soldiers in Germany would unite with those who are dissatisfied with the status quo in the Storm Troopers to oppose Hitler. It is reported that the National Socialist Party is divided into two factions regarding the Austrian issue. The Feoroenfeld faction advocates radicalism, while Foreign Minister Neurath, Hitler's representative Hess, and Hitler's confidant Rosenberg all advocate appropriate and fair resolution. The two factions are currently engaged in fierce secret struggles. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>The Late German President</p>
<h3>Funeral Held Tonight at Midnight</h3>
<p>Burial in Tannenberg to Commemorate War Achievements</p>
<p>Will Not Publish His Will Following Custom</p>
<p>A Lifetime of Integrity, Only £20,000 in Assets</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to the German News Agency, an agreement has been reached with the family regarding the burial place of President Hindenburg. Leader and Chancellor Hitler has ordered that the late President General Hindenburg be buried in the General's Tower of the Tannenberg battlefield memorial. The General's Tower will be converted into a memorial hall. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The final resting place of the late President Hindenburg has been definitively decided today. Hindenburg's remains will be buried under the General's Tower in the Tannenberg Memorial, rather than being returned to Neudeck. It is reported that the late President's assets were no more than £20,000, but according to custom, his will will not be published. (Previously, it was reported that the President's will had been lost, but now it is known to be untrue). As for the Neudeck villa property, it was gifted to his son on Hindenburg's eightieth birthday, thus avoiding inheritance tax. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Neudeck: At midnight on Monday, the body of the late President Hindenburg will begin its movement to Tannenberg, which is the last time that the military statesman will personally visit the site of his greatest success in life. On that night, Hindenburg's hearse will be placed on a gun carriage, flanked by the brigade he personally led during his lifetime, and transported to the burial site. Near Frogenau, Hindenburg's honor guard will make a two-minute stop, as that location was where Hindenburg personally commanded the German army to encircle the Russian army and annihilate the enemy. Starting from Hohenstein, the closest location to Tannenberg, the pallbearers will proceed on foot towards the memorial, with Storm Troopers lined up on both sides, shoulder to shoulder, each holding a torch. After the honor guard arrives at its destination, Hindenburg's body will be temporarily placed in the Tannenberg memorial tower, where a temporary altar has been constructed, which is where Hindenburg's body will temporarily reside. Then, Premier Hitler will deliver a eulogy on behalf of the people of the entire nation. After that, the altar will be moved to one of the eight towering gun emplacements, where it will be displayed for fourteen days to allow people from all over the country to come and pay their respects. Today, Hindenburg's body has been placed in a coffin, and his coffin has been moved from his bedroom to his study, where the commander of the honor guard stands guard day and night until the time of the transfer of the body on Monday night. Currently, the mourning sentiment in all parts of the German capital has been increasing daily. All taverns, cinemas, and entertainment venues have been closed, and the programs performed in theaters are all of a tragic nature, to match the spirit of the times. Church bells have also been stopped, to wait until the time of Hindenburg's burial on Tuesday to resonate with mournful sounds. All public and private houses have lowered their flags to half-mast to express mourning. In Berlin, people stand in long lines on Wilhelm Street, where Hindenburg's former residence is, to wait to enter the building to sign the condolence book, day and night. Compared to the recent past, when people gathered at the same location to wait to enter the building to sign the book to celebrate Hindenburg's birthday, the emotions of sadness and joy are different, which can be seen from their bowed heads and pensive expressions. It is estimated that no less than 250,000 people and representatives from various countries will attend Hindenburg's burial. All transportation arrangements are being made urgently. The Berlin diplomatic corps office will also be moved to Hohenstein station, the closest location to Tannenberg. Due to the inadequate hotel facilities in that area, representatives from various countries will have to use sleeping cars as temporary residences. It is estimated that more than one hundred special trains will be traveling to that area, and the postal and telecommunications authorities have added hundreds of miles of power lines to facilitate news transmission.

<p>(Berlin) The organ of powerful clubs in Germany, of which Vice-Chancellor von Papen is a member, published a protest, dissatisfied with the government's economic policies, pointing to government interference in commerce, leading to a lack of foreign exchange and raw materials. The newspaper said that the government issues new orders almost every day. These orders are becoming increasingly profound. With this development, freedom has been abolished, and now the substitute for freedom is national regulations, red tape, and excessive organization. Today, the government issued an order prohibiting manufacturers from arbitrarily purchasing lead, copper, nickel, and tin. Anyone who wants to purchase these items must first obtain a special license. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Commemoration of the 20th Anniversary of National Crisis</h3>
<p>Minister of Defense Broadcasts Speech</p>
<p>Recalling the Achievements of King Albert</p>
<p>Encouraging the People to Rise Up and Seek Self-Defense</p>
<p>Brussels: Belgian Minister of National Defense, Theunis, delivered a speech at the local radio broadcasting institute tonight to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Germany's violation of Belgian neutrality. (On August 4, 1914, Germany began to invade Belgium, violating Belgian neutrality. Today marks the 20th anniversary.) Theunis first encouraged the audience, saying that they should be unyielding and sacrifice everything to seek the security of their homeland. He then recounted the German invasion of neutrality and the bloody resistance of the Belgians, saying that the most admirable and immortal in history was King Albert. He continued, saying that the Belgian people at that time, regardless of Flemish or Walloon, volunteered to rise up. On the evening of August 4, 1914, the sunset shone on the birth of a new Belgium. At that time, the Belgians had no certainty about the future of their freedom and liberation, but they still rose up to resist foreign aggression without looking back. Belgium is a nation-state, not one artificially created by diplomats. This was confirmed by the Great War. Theunis continued, saying that in terms of law and honor, Belgium is beyond reproach. However, in terms of strength, had Belgium in 1914 done what it could to cope with the current crisis? The answer is no. When the majority of people were either busy with electoral competition, or held optimism, or held narrow self-interest, they did not prepare for strength. When national disaster struck, the army was not fully organized to defend the country. If King Albert had not had abundant military knowledge and great courage and enthusiasm, Belgium would have been doomed. Therefore, we can learn countless lessons from the last world war. What are the lessons? We deeply hope that a new era will come, in which justice will rule the world and all countries will abolish armaments. However, before this new era arrives, the security of the nation depends on its ability to defend itself against foreign aggression. The people must dedicate themselves to the nation so that they can make the necessary sacrifices in times of emergency, and at the same time use them to seek the greatest effect. Every free person should dedicate themselves to consolidating peace, but they should also always maintain their courage and perseverance and should not slacken for a single day.

<h3>A Glimpse of the German Coup D'état, German Correspondence</h3>
<p>Internal Split Within the National Socialist Party</p>
<p>The Storm Troopers are Virtually Dissolved</p>
<p>Germany Under Hitler's Party Rule Originally Had Many Contradictions. These contradictions are that the National Socialist Party is not unified. Another one is that Finance Capitalist and middle layer are not harmony. When the Hitler Cabinet was established, those who were not members of the National Socialist Party occupied a considerable number of positions, such as Vice-Chancellor von Papen, Foreign Minister Neurath, and Finance Minister Kroetzsch. The National Socialist Party's radical faction wanted to thoroughly implement its platform, so it clashed with the conservative faction. That is why von Papen gave his unfair speech at the University of Marburg on June 17, demanding reasonable freedom. However, in fact, it does not seem to have a very large relationship with internal conflicts within the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>The occurrence of the incident was that at 3:15 PM on June 30, the Berlin National Police suddenly dispatched and occupied the headquarters of the National Socialist Party Storm Troopers and the headquarters of the National Socialist Party Staff. Berlin immediately entered a state of martial law. Many National Socialist Party cadres were arrested and placed in prison. Storm Troopers Commander Röhm was arrested in Munich, and Brandenburg Storm Troopers Leader Ernst was arrested in Bremen and immediately subjected to military trials. In addition, the head of the Silesia local party department, the leader of the Munich district Storm Troopers, the branch leader of the Munich district Storm Troopers, the leader of the Pomerania district Storm Troopers, the deputy branch leader of the Munich district Storm Troopers, and the leader of the Saxony district Storm Troopers were sentenced to death by the Storm Troopers headquarters and executed by firing squad today. Furthermore, during the struggles, former Prime Minister General Schleicher and his wife were also killed. Although the exact number of other arrested people is unknown, the general number is several hundred. Furthermore, a warning network was set up on the national border line. All cars, trains, and pedestrians passing through the national border must undergo strict inspections before being allowed to pass. The severity of the situation is rare in Germany in recent years. After the incident, Hitler immediately appointed Lutze as the new commander of the Storm Troopers, and there was also a major change in cadres. This also shows the internal turmoil. The facts of the matter, as known to reporters, are roughly like this. At the same time, due to their blocking of news, many things are not very clear. As for why this incident occurred, simply put, it was a conflict between the radical faction and the conservative faction within the National Socialist Party. The radical faction can be considered Propaganda Minister Goebbels as the leader, and the conservative faction is headed by Vice-Chancellor von Papen. At the beginning of May, Goebbels called those who were dissatisfied with the National Socialist Party platform and policies reactionaries, advocated purging them, and wanted his subordinate Hitler Youth League to fight with the conservative Steel Helmet League, wanting to dissolve the Steel Helmet League. Behind the opposition to the radical faction are nobles, officials, and soldiers of the old era. That is why von Papen delivered his unfair speech. This speech was detained by the propaganda department and not published. However, this is still one of the superficial reasons. The content is not that simple.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Hitler's support base in reality is the middle class, the so-called white-collar class. Because he grasped the middle class, he defeated the Communist Party on the left and suppressed the Central Party and the Social Democratic Party on the right. At the same time, Hitler also understood that having only the middle class was just a tool for the masses. To engage in actual political struggles, one must unite with the Finance Capitalist sect. Therefore, he secretly joined hands with Finance Capital. When Hitler came to power, the middle class, dominated by small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, gained nothing except the empty name of middle-class dictatorship, advocating that the state is above all else. The Finance Capitalists, under the guise of统制济, took control of industry and finance. Therefore, important cabinet members such as Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Economics were all their people. Hitler only got the national police to maintain public order. Under these circumstances, the guidelines set by the National Socialist Party and the conditions that Hitler promised to the middle class were not implemented at all. Therefore, the Storm Troopers (S.S.), composed of small merchants, clerks, and workers, stood in opposition to the Guard Squad (S.V.), composed of soldiers, former bureaucrats, nobles, children, and intellectuals, despising and jealous of each other. Although the incident has temporarily come to an end and the purge has been successful, it is only temporary. I am afraid that the prelude to the incident will have even more severe and complex changes in the future. (July 1, Berlin)</p>

<h3>Red Bandits Flee to the Rear</h3>
<p>Bandits Adopt a Mobile Tactic</p>
<p>Looting Rice and Salt Everywhere</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Red bandits in Fujian, after being surrounded by the main forces in the four counties of Changting, Ninghua, Mingxi, and Qingliu and strictly blockaded, their situation is becoming increasingly desperate. Now, with the Eastern, Southern, and Northern Route armies about to launch a general offensive, and with oil and salt completely cut off, they know they have no strength to resist, and their destruction is imminent. In order to escape death, Luo Binghui gathered five to six thousand hungry and exhausted bandits from Mingxi and Qingliu counties in mid-July, adopting a mobile tactic, desperately breaking through the encirclement, invading the borders of Shaxian and Yong'an counties, looting rice and salt. The troops stationed in Shaxian, led by Liu Heding, and the troops stationed in Yong'an, led by Lu Xingbang, sent teams to pursue them, but the bandits fled as soon as they saw the government troops, not daring to fight. In late July, they invaded Youxi and Dayou counties from Yong'an and Shaxian. Although these two counties were Lu's defense area, they were far from the front line, so there were not many large troops stationed there. The bandits became rampant, gathering local bandits to expand their influence, and looting in various villages. The Fang Zhimin bandit gang, lurking on the border of Fujian and Zhejiang, has also been rampaging recently. Zhang Luanji's brigade recently dispatched a team to intercept them, and recovered Huangshi Street and Sidu Bridge. The bandits then fled from Chongpu border, Shibei Street, and Wufu City into Jianyang County. Liu Heding's troops are currently dispatching teams to encircle and suppress them. (August 1st)</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The recent bandit intrusion into Datian and Youxi was carried out by Peng Dehuai's 7,000-strong unit of Red bandits from Changting, who suddenly fled northeast from Changting in mid-July. On the 16th, they passed through Shangqin Yang, northeast of Liancheng, and on the 17th, they reached Xiaotao in Zhangping. The Ninth Division stationed in Liancheng and the Twelfth Regiment of the Zhangping Security Team sent troops to pursue and intercept them. The Eastern Route Headquarters of Zhangzhou also sent airplanes to bomb Xiaotao. The bandits did not engage in battle along the way and fled north quickly. On the 18th, they passed through Xiangliao in Ningyang and turned east of Yong'an, heading towards Datian. Most of the bandit suppression troops were on the front line. From Ningyang north to Datian and Youxi, the stationed troops were all security teams and guard regiments, with no heavy troops. The Datian garrison was only a guard regiment, and the county government and the security team stationed there did not build bunkers as ordered, and had no defenses to rely on, and were no match for the bandits. Therefore, the bandits were able to enter directly. Datian is located south of Youxi and Shaxian, north of Dehua and Yongchun, west of Yong'an, and east of Yongtai and Putian, a vital hub in central Fujian. The Eastern Route Headquarters urgently telegraphed troops stationed above and below to intercept them. Datian has a large amount of salt stored. After the bandits entered the city, they transported the salt north. At that time, they were joined by about 10,000 remnants of Red bandits and local communists from Yong'an and Shaxian. They stayed in the city for three days and abandoned the city on the 23rd. However, after leaving Datian, the direction of their flight is unknown. The armies on the front line are making every effort to search for them, but have found no trace. (August 3rd)</p>
<h3>Grand Canal Water Level Rises Again</h3>
<p>Due to Continued Rise of Yishui River in Second Phase</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Grand Canal water level, in the early part of last month, due to a sudden rise in the Yishui River, rose sharply by several feet. Various sections along the canal were actively preparing defenses to prevent accidents. By the latter part of the month, the Yishui River stopped rising, and the Shuangjin Sluice and Liujian Sluice were opened at the same time, diverting the central canal water into Honghu Lake via the Zhangfu River. Moreover, various sluice gates along the canal were also opened to allow for rice planting in the area south of the canal, so the canal water gradually receded, and the water level stabilized. Recently, the Yishui River has risen again in its second phase, causing the canal water to rise sharply again. In the past three days, the water level has risen three feet. As of the 1st, the water level at the Qingshui Sluice water gauge was two zhang four chi three cun, and the outflow was one zhang one chi seven cun. According to Chen Yuezhong, the director of the Huaipi section of the works bureau, the first phase of the Yishui River's rise had already passed during this year's flood season. At that time, the Shuangjin Sluice and Liujian Sluice were opened, diverting water into the lake via the Zhangfu River. Moreover, the sluice gates along the canal were also opened, so the water level was very low and very stable. Recently, due to the continued rise of the Yishui River in its second phase, the canal water has risen sharply again, and the water is muddy yellow. The Canal Works Bureau has ordered the heads of the various sections of the works bureau to instruct the various flood control stations along the central and southern canals to actively prepare defenses and allocate summer flood control funds. Judging from the current trend of the canal water situation this year, although it is rising, the water level at the Qingjiang Sluice has not increased significantly. Moreover, the water level recorded at the Qingjiang Sluice is two zhang four chi, which is more than four feet lower than the water level recorded at the Qingjiang Sluice during the great flood of the twentieth year of the Republic, which was two zhang eight chi eight cun. Although the Yishui River has risen twice, fortunately the Huai River has not risen at the same time. The summer flood season may be safe. Now, if we can get through the third phase of the Yishui River's rise, and if the Huai and Yi Rivers do not rise at the same time, then the summer flood season can be worry-free. However, the danger period has not yet passed.</p>
<h3>Inspection Tour in the Northwest by Our Special Correspondent Geng Ya</h3>
<p>Crossing the Gansu-Qinghai Provincial Border at Xiangtang Bridge</p>
<p>Advancing more than ten li from Dajiachuan to Ping'an Fort (commonly called Ma Huizi), which is under the jurisdiction of Yongdeng County. There is a district-established national primary school. The school site is temporarily using a temple, without any classroom facilities. Students sit cross-legged on the ground, two students sharing a round table as a desk for writing and reading. The table is provided by the students themselves, carrying it to school in the morning and back home in the evening, which is particularly strenuous. The books on the table are all the Analects and Mencius. A timetable is posted on the wall, with the first line only writing "Morning Recitation, Afternoon Literacy." The middle line lists the names of the students, such as "Bao Facai, Wang Jia Wangde, Fang Jia Six Surnames," and so on, eighteen people in total. The last line is "Do not say that you were not warned." The teacher reclines on a dirt kang, so it is inconvenient to inquire about it casually, making its profound meaning unfathomable. According to a student, "The teacher is afraid that we will arrive late or leave early, so every time he takes attendance, he chants the seven characters 'Do not say that you were not warned' to intimidate us. After chanting, he falls asleep. As for us, the naughty ones run to the main hall to play hide-and-seek, and the diligent ones hug their textbooks and hum randomly. Studying like this is not as good as farming at home," and so on. The food shops there are all set up by Hui people, specializing in cold noodles and sesame cakes. A bowl of noodles costs thirty da (copper coins), and a jin of cake costs one jiao. The food sold is fairly clean. There are many Han Chinese farmers, but very few merchants. Those who do exist only open small inns. From northern Long to Lanzhou, and from Lanzhou to here, the living conditions of the residents at each station are mostly similar, as if there were a clear regulation.</p>
<p>There are many caves in the high mountains outside the fort, looking like beehives from a distance. It is speculated that they were dwellings of the early people, or were once plains, but later, due to the remoteness of time and the lowering of rivers, they became suspended high on the cliffs. After ten li to Heizuizi, we stayed for the night. The villagers piled stones to form a "dun," also called a "stone fort," reaching over a zhang in height, with two red flags inserted on top, and over ten gleaming knives and guns erected beside it. Furthermore, the dun was sprinkled all over with the blood of dogs and sheep. When asked about its purpose, the answer was "to ward off the arrival of storms." The spirit of the age of theocracy still remains, and its remnant poison on the people is unsurpassed.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, we departed from Heizuizi. After five li, we reached Feishi Cliff, with dangerous cliffs and scattered rocks above, posing a constant threat of collapse. Below, the rapids surged violently, with turbulent waves. Only a narrow path in the middle allowed passage. Travelers here are all apprehensive and deeply cautious. This road was repaired once during the Tongzhi era, and six chang (each chang being two and a half mu) of land were publicly allotted, with rent collected annually to cover road repair expenses. The law was well-intentioned and beneficial, and pedestrians praised it. After five li, there was a dirt slope, and the road gradually became flat. After ten li, we reached Tongjiagou. The land there must be cultivated every other year, and can only be planted with wheat and corn. Female farmers weeding the wheat fields mostly worked with bare torsos, and were quite agile. Although they were under the scorching sun, sweating like rain, they smiled when they saw people, seeming not to find it bitter. "How is the joy of farmers?" One can see a glimpse of it here. After ten li, we reached Xinzhuangzi. The river water was vermilion. Across the bank, the jujube orchard and wheat fields were green and boundless, extremely beautiful. Along the river, the narrow path was overhung by dangerous cliffs, seeming about to collapse. Upon reaching Gucheng, although it was built by scholars, it was very tall and sturdy, and there were many residents. Outside the city, the road was a sunken path, four or five li long. After the rain, it was muddy. The mules moved slowly, and mosquitoes and ants flew wildly, following people, unable to be waved away, sucking at people's necks, which was incredibly itchy and painful. After thirty li, we reached Shuichewan. There was a complex chorus of voices, and the market was flourishing. Idle farmers from Qinghai, carrying grain and dragging sticks, came to Long to hoe, harvest, and cut wheat in an endless stream. According to them, "Each day's work earns forty to sixty da, accumulating three or four yuan per month. If you do contract work, you can earn ten or more yuan, so you can repay debts at home and hope for a surplus," and so on. The natural border between Gansu and Qinghai is the Liancheng River. The river water is clear and cool. There is a bridge called Xiangtang Bridge. On the eastern end, the inscription reads "Longhai Tongkui," and on the western end, "Lingju Gusai," both inscribed by Ma Bufang. The couplet reads "A bay of clear water is like a clear mirror, and green mountains on both sides support a colorful rainbow." The bridge is forty-four paces long, with a tiled railing. Walking on it leisurely, one forgets that one is walking on air. The east is the border of Long, where poisonous flowers bloom in abundance, red and white interspersed. The west belongs to Qing, with green wheat and green melons, a boundless expanse of green. The former grows tobacco, while the latter does not. By contrast, there is a unique charm. Two li west of the bridge is a town called Xiangtang, belonging to Minhe County. The county seat is five li away, formerly known as Shuikou. The transportation there is convenient in all directions, the population is large, the canals flow horizontally and vertically, and the agricultural products are abundant. The financial situation is that one silver yuan can be exchanged for twelve jiao of Qing province treasury maintenance coupons, or six thousand wen of copper coins. Copper coins valued at ten or twenty are all in general use. Newly minted coins from Sichuan province valued at one hundred or two hundred must have the characters (TS) stamped by the treasury before they can be used. Prices are very low. Each yuan can buy five jin of beef and mutton, six jin of sesame oil, eighteen jin of salt, two hundred jin of coal, and one hundred and eighty eggs. Compared with the cost of living in Lanzhou, it is much cheaper.</p>
<p>The rural houses in the villages of Gansu and Qinghai provinces are mostly covered with earth instead of tiles. The method of construction is also relatively simple. Grass is laid on the pillars, beams, rafters, and then plastered with mud, about three inches thick. The roof is slightly sloped, as flat as a ping, for drying jerky</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>of cattle, sheep, and horses. When dry, holes are drilled in the ping and swept into the stove room to serve as fuel. These holes can usually serve as chimneys and can also be covered when it rains. According to reports, although building earthen houses can save money, they must be cleaned of old soil and replaced with new mud in as little as three years or as much as five years. Otherwise, even a light rain will seep through, creating a leaky room. It is also said that before the Republic, those with fame and status were allowed to build houses with tiles. Otherwise, even if they were as rich as Shi Chong, they had to live in earthen houses. Although this is no longer the case, no one dares to break the rule, especially in remote villages, fearing that the local gentry will seize the opportunity to impose unwarranted heavy fines.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Father and Daughter Engage in Incestuous Affair, Fearing Scandal and Killing Daughter</h3>
<p>Sheng Chaofu, 38 years old, owner of Sheng Hongxing Jewelry Store at No. 24 Lindun Road, is from Yangzhou. His wife, from Shanghai, passed away last August. He has a daughter named Xiuying, 18 years old, who was born from his wife's previous husband. After losing his wife, Chaofu saw that Xiuying's appearance was still passable, and disregarded the distinction between father and daughter, indulging in bestial desires. The daughter, with weak intellect, soon had a physical relationship. Since then, the father and daughter acted like husband and wife. This spring, Xiuying became pregnant, her belly swollen and unable to be concealed. Chaofu was still worried about scandal and wanted to find a way to abort the fetus. Xiuying also agreed. At first, she used plaster on her navel, which was ineffective. So, four days ago, she was sent to Gengsheng Hospital in Changmen to request an abortion, but she was rejected. After returning home, the father and daughter had a big argument. At one o'clock in the morning on the 5th, Chaofu suddenly wanted to kill his daughter, and strangled Xiuying. After half a minute, she fainted immediately, then woke up again, and rushed out the door, shouting for help. After the police on duty inquired about the situation, they took Chaofu and his daughter to the Second Branch, and transferred the case to the General Bureau for verification on the grounds of incest, adultery, and attempted murder.</p>
<h3>Taicang County Magistrate Wang Strictly Handles Opium Case</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Taicang County Magistrate Wang Baoxuan has received reports from various parties about the connivance and protection of the Public Security Bureau. While he was investigating the matter closely, he recently received a secret report that Li Zhonglan, a patrolman at the Yuewang Township Guard Post of the Public Security Bureau, was protecting opium dens, and Ma Jiayong, a patrol officer at the Second Substation, had bribed and released opium offenders. He was furious, and on the dawn of the 2nd of this month, he personally led judicial police and defense team soldiers to Yuewang Township. According to the address, he arrested the two suspects who opened opium dens, Sheng A Xiao and Xu Fusheng, and seized more than 30 pieces of opium paraphernalia. The suspects directly confessed that they had been bribed and released by the Second Substation and protected by the patrolman of Yuewang Township. After Wang returned to the county office with the case, he interrogated the opium offenders while secretly ordering Gan Zhuo, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to immediately suspend Patrol Officer Ma Jiayong and Patrolman Li Zhonglan from their duties and hand them over to the county for legal action. Unexpectedly, as late as the evening of the 3rd, the Public Security Bureau reported that the patrol officer and patrolman had all fled and had not been caught. It is said that Wang insisted on thoroughly investigating this major opium case and severely punishing corruption in order to appease public opinion.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Xicheng Road Automobile Competition Causes Disputes</h3>
<p>In order to treat passengers preferentially, the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company specially reduced the ticket price, from Xixi to Cheng, by half a yuan per passenger, and submitted the request to the Construction Bureau for submission to the County Government for record. The county approved it and waited for it to be forwarded to the Construction Department for verification. However, the various business small cars, because of the price reduction by the Xicheng Company, had their livelihood cut off, so they gathered together to devise a countermeasure. Yesterday, the Xicheng Company still distributed leaflets, declaring the price reduction, and hired people to solicit customers. The various business car lines also had their partners solicit customers on the road. In the afternoon, one of the small car partners, Tian A'er, was fined by the police on duty for soliciting customers and ordered to kneel in the street for two hours. Seeing this, the Business Automobile Association immediately convened an emergency meeting and decided to send Zhang Shaoyi and Cao Xuemei as representatives to the County Government Construction Bureau to petition. Secretary Ye received them and stated that he would summon both parties for negotiations on the morning of the 6th.</p>
<h3>Opposition to Silkworm Seed Unified Control Method</h3>
<p>The autumn silkworm seeds of this session will be subject to unified control. All kinds of silkworm seeds from various places in the province will be purchased by the Construction Department and distributed for feeding. The province plans to produce 840,000 sheets of seeds. At a 75% discount, all kinds of places producing more than 5,000 sheets of seeds must also allocate 30% for export and sale to other provinces. The remaining mountain provinces will purchase them, paying a price of one jiao and five fen per sheet in advance. The silk seed industry association of this county believes that this matter is of great importance to the interests of various places, and specially convened a general meeting of members at 2 pm yesterday to urgently discuss countermeasures. The silk seed industry associations of Wu County and Wujin also sent representatives to Xixi to participate. It was decided that (1) the province's order to forcibly export 30% for sale to other provinces was opposed. Representatives from the three counties will immediately go to the silkworm seed distribution office in Xixi to request that the province withdraw the order and request a supplementary seed payment of five jiao and five fen per sheet, totaling seven jiao per sheet, otherwise they will refuse acid immersion. At the same time, representatives will be sent to the province to petition. (2) It is requested that the Provincial Improvement Association exempt separate transportation and allow various places to transport the seeds to the silkworm seed distribution office in Xixi. After the meeting, the representatives from the three counties went to the silkworm seed distribution office in Xixi and met with Director Xiong Qirui to petition. Mr. Xiong said that the first point would be forwarded to the province, and the second point has been stipulated by the department that five jiao per sheet will be given in advance, and there are still three jiao to be supplemented after inspecting the cocoon results of the autumn harvest. The representatives left immediately. Furthermore, the silk factory industry association of this county, because of this year's drought, farmers cannot afford to buy autumn silkworm seeds for feeding, specially submitted a report to the provincial government yesterday, requesting that the price of autumn silkworm seeds in this session be paid from the disaster relief funds in order to protect farmers and merchants.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Department Committee Investigates Accumulated Grain Warehouse</h3>
<p>Yu Bingdong, a member of the Civil Department, and Zhu Yuwu, a member of the Finance Department, came to Changzhou on the afternoon of the 4th. It was heard that their mission was to investigate and handle matters concerning warehouses and accumulated grain for disaster relief. They then went to the county government to make contact, where Secretary Sun made the contact. According to the county government's recent investigation, the county has a total of 65,469 dan 9 dou 5 sheng of rice, 3,806 dan 8 dou 9 sheng of rice, and 285 shi of Lai grain in 19 districts. The grain funds include 72,951 yuan 2 jiao 9 fen stored by the Food Management Committee, and a total of 22,257 yuan 2 jiao 6 fen stored by the 19 districts. There are 15,000 bags of flour stored for disaster prevention.</p>
<h3>Qidong County Executive Committee Friends Embezzle Public Funds</h3>
<p>Zhou, Shi, and several other members of the Qidong County Party Executive Committee have always been incompatible with each other. Recently, they have become friends and forged receipts, embezzling more than 500 yuan of public funds. Zhou Yuanjia, a member of the county party committee's supervisory committee, discovered the malpractice, collected evidence, and legally reported it to the provincial party committee. Li Jingzhai, a special envoy of the central government stationed in Jiangsu, was furious upon learning of this and immediately ordered Zhang Jinchun, a provincial department cadre, to secretly investigate in Qi. After arriving in Qi, Zhang investigated the case for two days and found that the results matched the reported case. He submitted the confirmed evidence of Zhou and others' embezzlement. Special Envoy Li believed that the case not only involved party discipline but also violated criminal law and strongly advocated severe punishment in order to deter others from following suit.</p>
<h3>Nantong District Administrative Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>The first administrative conference convened by the Nantong District Commissioner's Office held its closing ceremony at 8 am on the 4th. Shen Baixian, Director of the Construction Department, Zhao Zhiyou, Chairman of the Yangtze River Waterway Management Committee, and Song Xishang, Director of the Public Works Department, all attended. Shen Baixian delivered a speech, and Zhao and Song came to Nantong to investigate the collapse of the riverbank and determine a permanent plan. One is to take the opportunity to inspect the counties, and the most urgent issue at present is the Baojia problem for social stability. As for riverbank protection, it should be carried out according to the instructions of the Waterway Management Committee. If one district cannot handle it, it should seek help from the province. If one province cannot handle it, it should seek help from the central government. The counties in the Nantong district are agricultural areas and cannot rely solely on the sky. Efforts should be made to dredge rivers, and the counties must cooperate in building roads. Zhao Zhiyou delivered a speech, saying that he was fortunate to participate in the closing ceremony of the conference and had the opportunity to meet with people from various counties, which was extremely pleasant. The Yangtze River area is vast, and the management committee is located in one place, so it is not without isolation from the situations in various places. He hoped that the counties would provide opinions to the committee from time to time. The central government, the province, and the counties should work together to achieve results easily. Song Xishang delivered a speech, saying that he came to Nantong to investigate the collapse of the riverbank and to establish the Downstream River Management Association. In fact, the two things are two in one. The Yangtze River is the second largest river in the world, and its condition has deteriorated in recent years. The整治工程 are all technical, and he sincerely hopes that the counties will provide instructions. Director Zhang delivered a speech, saying that the conference's proposals are all aimed at social stability and construction plans. He hoped that efforts would be made to implement them in the future. Commissioner Zheng delivered a speech, saying that special attention should be paid to Baojia, opium prohibition, and conscription. He also said that Mr. Wang Qingmu, who is 75 years old, has been persevering throughout the conference, and has the spirit of a foreign old man. Moreover, today's conference brings together the central government, the province, and the counties, which is historically memorable. After the meeting, they went to Cao Ding's tomb of the anti-Japanese martyrs on Wolf Mountain Road for a public祭.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Detective Team Uncovers Bandit Ship</h3>
<p>The family of Lu Mianxuan, a wealthy household in Majia Township, Dongxiang, was robbed by bandits last December, and his three-year-old grandson, Shunxizi, was kidnapped and demanded a ransom of 1,200 yuan. Because he had no cash, he had not redeemed him. He recently received a threatening letter from the bandits urging him to pay the ransom. Fearing that he would be harmed, Lu reported it to the county government for arrest. The county sent Detective Team Leader Zhu Hui to investigate and arrest the bandits. After some time, he cooperated with the Xianzhen Guard Team Leader and seized a boat in the Wulimiao area of Sishui Town in Baoying County. When they checked the boat, they found the child surnamed Lu. The bandit leader escaped upon hearing the news, and only the boatman Chen Yongde was captured and escorted to the county. The child surnamed Lu was already emaciated and frail. The county has notified the family to come and claim him.</p>
<h3>Caowang Market Entire Town Strike</h3>
<p>The Caowang Market Public Security Outpost in Dongxiang is stationed in the town by Service Member Xie Qing and Patrolman Liu Fang, leading more than a dozen police officers. The other morning, Xie and others bought wax gourds there. Due to a dispute over the weight, they used their power to beat up the melon vendor and his son, arousing the merchants and residents there to protest. The entire town went on strike. Gao Xinpan, the head of the Fourth District, went to mediate after hearing the news. It is said that the merchants and residents of the town are determined that the minimum requirement is that Xie and others be removed from their positions before the market can reopen.</p>
<p>Eighteen-Gang Directors and Boatmen</p>
<p>Urge the Handling of West Xiang Bank Sailing Transport</p>
<p>Xierwei Eighteen-Gang Directors Xie Zhaojia and Duan Zhizhou, and boatmen representatives Chen Zhensheng and Zhu Zhaoluan, came to Yangzhou last time to urge the handling of sailing transport. Xiao Shouzhi and Tai Gangwu, representatives of the Four-Bank Guild, agreed to urge various merchants to handle sailing transport, and admitted that in addition to Xiang Bank, the West Bank would handle 40 tickets of transport, but it has not been done yet, resulting in the complete cessation of livelihood for boatmen. They came to Yangzhou on the 3rd and went to the West Bank Guild to demand the fulfillment of the previous agreement. During the meeting between the two parties, the Guild, represented by Yi Yintang and Zhu Zemin, stated four reasons why they could not handle the transport: (1) The salt arriving on the bank by sailing transport is slower to sell; (2) They were ordered to switch to麻 bags, but the麻 bags have not yet been obtained; (3) They were ordered to set up an auction place, and they are still worried about losing money on the salt that has already been transported, so how can they continue to transport it; (4) The Shanghai Continental Company has already transported 50 tickets to the bank by轮運, and sales on the bank are bound to be sluggish. The directors and representatives of the gang recognized the four reasons as fundamental problems, and stated that Xiang Bank has 121 tickets, but only 21 tickets have been transported, and the West Bank has 40 tickets, but only 2 tickets have been transported. The livelihood of the boatmen has been completely cut off, and there is an urgent need to find a treatment method to maintain the status quo. They also requested a written reply so that they could take it to the authorities in Beijing to petition. The Guild representatives said that the case was important and should convene a general meeting. If it could be handled, they would continue the meeting at 7 pm on the 4th to discuss it.</p>
<h3>Haimen Sea County Disaster Unabated</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, this county has been plagued by drought. After several showers fell from the 17th to the 24th of last month, farmers in various districts rushed to sow beans to make up for the loss. Unexpectedly, it has been sunny and without rain again for ten days. The tender sprouts of beans that have already sprouted, and the newly developed cotton seedlings, have gradually withered after being steamed by the scorching sun. Furthermore, pests such as diamond drills and cutworms have occurred, and the damage to crops has become more severe. If it does not rain again for another ten days, the autumn harvest will be hopeless. Farmers in general are frowning and sighing, worried and anxious.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Manufacturing Agency Uncovered</h3>
<p>Near Wudi on the border of Hai and Qi counties, Chen Zhirong and others from Haimen secretly set up an agency to manufacture red pills, which were sold widely and yielded considerable profits. The Qidong County Government learned of this and secretly ordered Zhou Baode, the captain of the First Company of the Defense Team, to lead more than a dozen police officers to search at about 10 pm the day before yesterday (the 1st). They arrested Chen Zhirong, Shen Qiangmin, Zhang Chaoding, Shen Xiaomo sister, and other four suspects who were making pills, and seized a pill-making machine and two large洋鐵箱 of red pill raw materials. They were all detained and sent to the county government for interrogation and confessed without denial. They were escorted to the Nantong District Commissioner's Office for trial yesterday morning (the 2nd).</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Xiaoxueqian Street Fire</h3>
<p>A fire broke out suddenly at 2:30 pm yesterday on the upstairs of the Qian family on Xiaoxueqian Street in Hangzhou City. In an instant, thick smoke filled the air and could not be contained. The fire brigade, the fire rescue association, and various Jiyi dragons rushed to put out the fire, which was extinguished after half an hour. It is estimated that one room on the upstairs of Dexingxiang silk thread store at No. 56, one room on the upstairs of Ni Baozhai sauce duck store at No. 58, and two rooms of厢房 each of Yue Meixiang noodle restaurant at No. 60 were burned down, with a total loss of about 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan Sandy Cotton Fields Devastated by Locusts</h3>
<p>Recently, large numbers of locusts have been gnawing on the cotton stalks in the sandy areas of Xiaoshan, and swarms of them have gathered in the Ren Shantou, Longwangtang, and Yujiatan areas of Beixiang, totaling hundreds of thousands. All the cotton leaves and cotton stalks have been completely eaten, and thousands of acres of cotton fields are about to become barren land, with losses of tens of millions or more.</p>

<h3>Report on the Implementation of Resolutions from the National Finance Conference (Continued)</h3>
<p>丨Compiled by the Local Tax Consolidation Committee of the Ministry of Finance丨</p>
<p>6.  The Ministry received a report from the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance on July 23rd, stating that the province's taxes and levies that fall under provincial jurisdiction are not considered excessive or complex. However, the various local county surcharges and additional levies are necessary for essential administrative needs and cannot be immediately and completely abolished. The proposed steps for abolishing excessive and complex levies and reducing various surcharges in the province are outlined below:</p>
<p>A.  Various unauthorized taxes and levies or those collected without approval or for non-essential purposes, totaling over seventy types, amount to 67,632 yuan (detailed in Appendix 8). Additional levies on land tax amount to 286,891 yuan (detailed in Appendix 9). Surcharges on miscellaneous taxes amount to 117,347 yuan, totaling over 470,000 yuan. Counties should be instructed to abolish these immediately.</p>
<p>B.  Regarding over 150 types of income that, although excessive and complex, are used for legitimate expenditures, totaling 283,997 yuan, counties should be instructed to quickly find alternative sources of revenue before December of this year to abolish these levies on schedule.</p>
<p>C.  If the income is legitimate, but the expenditures are not essential, strict review of the county budget estimates should be conducted, and surplus funds from expenditure cuts should be used to offset the revenue loss from abolishing the above-mentioned levies.</p>
<p>D.  If both the income and expenditures are legitimate, but the burden on the people is too heavy, strict instructions should be given to thoroughly reduce the levies, or the provincial department should酌予裁减them, ordering compliance.</p>
<p>As for the financial conference's resolution that local authorities should not arbitrarily increase taxes and levies beyond the legal正税, instructions have been issued to comply, and the provincial government has been informed. The Ministry's regulations on consolidating business taxes, reforming the land tax collection system, and eliminating temporary apportions have also been forwarded for compliance.</p>
<p>7.  On July 28th, the Ministry approved an電感電報telegram from the Ningxia Provincial Government, stating that the provincial government's regular meeting decided to comply with the resolutions of the financial conference, starting with the abolition of excessive and complex levies. Following the Ministry's set deadlines, the process is divided into three phases.</p>
<p>The first phase includes nine items: rice purchase levy, livestock levy, salt camel levy, vehicle camel levy, land area levy, opium lamp levy, sheep pair levy, pigeon loft levy, and porterage levy, requiring 10,398 yuan per month, effective from August 1st.</p>
<p>The second phase includes two items: post-disaster fines and special cigarette levy, requiring 25,095 yuan per month, effective from October 1st.</p>
<p>The third phase includes one item: temporary maintenance fee, totaling 344,660 yuan per year, effective from January 1st, 1935.</p>
<p>8.  On July 13th, the Ministry received a letter from the Gansu Provincial Department of Finance, stating that the people of Gansu deeply resent excessive levies, which need no further elaboration. The provincial government has drafted a plan to abolish the most excessive and detailed taxes and levies in phases, prioritizing the most urgent ones for the first phase, including the grinding tax (approximately 40,000 yuan per year), camel levy (approximately 120,000 yuan per year), and tea tax (approximately 130,000 yuan per year), with the intention of announcing their abolition immediately to alleviate the people's suffering. Regarding land tax, the levy on garrison grain is particularly unfair, with the assessed amount often exceeding the civilian grain quota by several times. The government is currently setting a deadline to convert garrison grain into civilian grain to equalize the burden. Once implemented, it will reduce the burden by approximately 300,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>9.  On July 30th, the Ministry received a letter from the Chahar Provincial Department of Finance, stating that the county governments had already fundamentally abolished 24 types of excessive and detailed miscellaneous levies in May and June of this year. The province is currently planning to reduce all county surcharges on land tax that exceed the正赋tax to an equal level. In addition, there are three improper sources of income for each county: corvée labor, surcharges, and government surplus. The plan is to eliminate them entirely. Regarding the surcharges on deed tax at the provincial and county levels, the province will核减reduce them based on the principles of the financial conference resolutions. Other taxes on dried and fresh food, reed mats, stone materials, cotton cloth, and斗捐grain levies will also be reduced or exempted separately. It is estimated that the abolition of land tax levies will amount to approximately 300,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>10. Regarding Jiangsu Province, the headquarters of the Second War Zone received a report from the Jiangsu Provincial Government on July 27th, stating that Jiangsu Province is implementing the abolition of excessive levies as a priority, in accordance with the central government's orders and to relieve the people's suffering. Ninety-eight types of local county miscellaneous levies are considered excessive and detailed and need to be abolished. Among these, 21 types are newly levied and lack concrete figures. The remaining 77 types amount to over 95,000 yuan per year (detailed in Appendix 10). The province plans to abolish these in the second phase. In addition, the illegal miscellaneous levies in each county are still under investigation and consolidation for orderly elimination by the regulatory deadline of the end of December 1934.</p>

<p>Although the above items have been included in the 1934 local county budget revenue items, their nature is inevitably excessive and detailed. It is proposed to abolish them first to set a good example. Except for the Linqing boat levy of over 13,000 yuan, which is a relatively large amount, it is proposed to offset it by allocating the existing local military repayment funds. The amounts for Wudi, Changqing, Penglai, and Qihe counties range from over 4,000 yuan to over 1,100 yuan, respectively, and should be offset by allocating funds from the county's local surplus funds or deducting them from the local reserve fund. For the remaining counties, the funds shortened due to the abolition of miscellaneous levies will be deducted from their 1934 local reserve funds to ensure verification. Please advise if this is feasible.</p>

<p>Local News of This City: Both Railways are Planning to Build Warehouses at Various Stations</p>
<h3>Establishing a Loan of 15 Million</h3>
<p>Terms Fully Agreed, Interest Rate Very Low</p>
<p>Construction Sites Already Planned</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Railway Bureau, in view of the fact that the original warehouses along the lines at various stations were temporary storage facilities for goods in transit, with strict limitations on the storage period, is now planning to expand the warehouses at various stations to facilitate the storage of goods by merchants, allowing for free storage periods to facilitate capital turnover and waiting for favorable prices, and to facilitate the phased shipment of goods. Efforts will be made to improve the procedures for storing goods in warehouses, making them as simple and convenient as possible, so that merchants can obtain full convenience and economic benefits.</p>
<h3>Proposed Construction Sites</h3>
<p>The locations for the expansion of warehouses at various stations have been decided as follows: (1) Nanjing Riverside, (2) Zhenjiang Riverside, (3) Changzhou, (4) Wuxi, (5) Suzhou, (6) McGin Road, (7) Shanghai North Station, (8) Shanghai South Station, (9) Wusong, (10) Rihui Port, (11) Zha Kou, (12) Cao'e River. The above locations are all warehouses along the Jinghu Section, Huhang Section, Yongshao Section, and Songhu Section, with the largest capacity being tens of thousands of metric tons and the smallest capacity being one thousand metric tons.</p>
<h3>Loan Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Since Huang Boqiao took office as the director of the Railway Bureau, he has gained considerable social trust in terms of business reorganization, etc. For example, for the construction of the railway from Zha Kou to Cao'e Section, the Sino-British Bank and the China Construction Bank are both willing to lend money to assist. Now, for the expansion of warehouses, it has also negotiated with five banks in Shanghai, including the Bank of China, to borrow 15 million yuan, with a very low interest rate. All the terms have been agreed upon, and the loan contract will be signed soon.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Will Issue</p>
<h3>30 Million Yuan in Public Bonds</h3>
<p>For Conducting the Huai River Diversion and Consolidating Old Debts</p>
<p>According to the Shin Shih News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Government recently decided to issue public bonds to develop water conservancy in Jiangsu Province and consolidate various provincial treasury debts from the past, so as to allocate funds and carry out various construction projects. Yesterday, the Shin Shih News Agency reporter inquired about the details from the banking sector and relevant parties as follows:</p>
<h3>Public Bond Amount</h3>
<p>The amount of this public bond issue is 30 million yuan. The Finance Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government has drafted detailed rules and submitted them to the central government and the Executive Yuan for review. The issuance period for this public bond is set at 20 years, with an annual interest rate of 7%.</p>
<h3>Tax Revenue Guarantee</h3>
<p>This public bond is guaranteed by a portion of Jiangsu Province's tax revenue for the periodic repayment of principal and interest, including: (1) salt tax surcharge, with an annual income of approximately 1.8 million yuan; (2) land deed tax, with approximately 1 million yuan; (3) land tax, with 300,000 yuan, totaling over 3.1 million yuan. In the future, the credit and guarantee will be very solid, and the central government is expected to approve it.</p>
<h3>Coming to Shanghai for Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government has sent personnel to contact banks in this city to discuss mortgage現欵cash, and the detailed methods are still under negotiation.</p>
<h3>Use and Allocation</h3>
<p>The use of this public bond has been decided: (1) consolidating old debts; (2) completing the Huai River diversion to the sea project; (3) opening up a new canal. The allocation of funds is roughly as follows: 6 million yuan for repaying old debts and interest to various banks, 9 million yuan for repaying old public bonds, 6.5 million yuan for opening up a new canal, and the remaining 6.5 million yuan for completing the unfinished Huai River diversion to the sea project.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Sends Personnel to Europe and America</p>
<h3>To Inspect Hospital Equipment</h3>
<p>Yu You-shi to Go Abroad Within the Month</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the municipal government, in order to build the city center area, had submitted a request to the central government for approval to issue 3.5 million yuan in municipal public bonds. It was decided to allocate 400,000 yuan from this public bond to build a large-scale municipal hospital. Various matters are being actively prepared. In order to improve the hospital's equipment, the Ministry of Interior's Health Department decided to jointly dispatch Yu You-shi, director of the Nanshi Clinic, to Europe and America to inspect the health undertakings and hospital equipment of various countries for reference. Mr. Yu is scheduled to depart from Shanghai within this month and return to the country after one year.</p>
<p>Municipal Government</p>
<h3>Decides to Send Personnel to England</h3>
<p>To Inspect Factory Boilers</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, after the Ministry of Industry established the Central Factory Inspection Office for factory inspection matters, it stipulated inspection procedures and sent them to various provinces and cities for compliance and gradual implementation. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau specifically established a factory inspection section to handle it. All factory inspectors are trained and qualified professionals. Preliminary inspections have been completed in the Chinese-controlled areas of Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and Huxi. The issue of factory inspections in the public concession and the French concession will also be resolved. In view of the dangers of factory boilers, such as the explosion of the boiler at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, the bureau submitted a request to the municipal government for approval and specifically sent personnel to practice at famous boiler factories in England and inspect foreign factories in order to provide a reference for factory inspections in our country. It is reported that passport procedures are currently being processed, and they are scheduled to go abroad at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Li Pingheng Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Report on the Proceedings of Attending the International Labor Conference</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, Li Pingheng and his party of seven representatives from China who attended the 18th International Labor Conference returned to Shanghai at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday and immediately stayed at the China Hotel. The city's industrial and commercial groups believed that Mr. Li and others had fulfilled their mission and that our country had been elected as a director. At the same time, the case of factory inspections in the concession had also achieved considerable results, which was commendable. A banquet was held at the Yiyou Society on Hankou Road at 6:00 PM the night before yesterday to welcome them and celebrate. It is reported that government representative Li Pingheng, advisor Bao Huaguo, and secretary He Jing are scheduled to take the Jinghu night train to Beijing last night to visit Minister Chen and report on the proceedings of attending the International Labor Conference.</p>
<p>Wang Zhisheng and Bao Huaguo</p>
<h3>Talk About Inspection Impressions</h3>
<p>European Industry Declining</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Dumped Everywhere</p>
<p>After the representatives attending the International Labor Conference returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday, various industrial and commercial groups in the city, such as the中华工業總聯合會China General Federation of Industry, jointly held a public banquet. The Daily News Agency reporter interviewed Wang Zhisheng, the capital representative, who told about the state of industry in various European countries as follows:</p>
<h3>Employers in Various Countries Share the Same View</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wang, very few of the programs proposed at this Labor Conference were related to China. However, regarding the 40-hour work week, the Chinese employers, due to the decline of their businesses, could not bear any further burden. Therefore, they drafted a brief statement in the employer group, stating their position and that under the current circumstances, the implementation time could not be allowed. Subsequently, employers in various countries also shared this view, so the proposal was reserved for discussion at the next conference.</p>
<h3>European Industry in Almost Universal Decline</h3>
<p>The phenomenon of recession is prevalent everywhere in Europe, and everything is contracting. Especially in the United Kingdom, the cotton textile industry in Lancashire has almost no place to sell all its products, and the economy is even more exhausted. In addition, along the coasts of various parts of Europe, the number of ships搁idle and unused is at least 200,000 tons and as many as millions of tons. The reason is that tariffs are high, finance cannot circulate, and military spending is too high, which the people cannot负担bear.</p>
<h3>Qian Chengxu Goes to Various Countries for Inspection</h3>
<p>When the reporter inquired about the whereabouts of Mr. Qian Chengxu, he replied that after the closing of the conference, Mr. Qian went to Italy, the Czech Republic, and Germany to investigate the Feiyeto Automobile Company, the Bajia Manufacturing Company, the塞耳鑛务公司Serer Mining Company, and the Siemens and Zeiss Lens Companies. As of the date of our departure, he was still in Berlin and was invited by universities such as Berlin and Leipzig to lecture on industrial economics. He sent a letter to me, stating that he would go from France to England on July 21st and then go to the United States. Most of his investigation reports have been sent back one after another and are currently being copied, sorted, edited, and printed. The entire book can be published by the end of the year at the latest.</p>
<h3>Bao Huaguo Talks About Japanese Goods in Europe</h3>
<p>The Daily News Agency reporter visited Bao Huaguo, a consultant to the government representative, at the China Hotel yesterday. According to him, the situation regarding the National Labor Conference has been described in detail in the speech by Representative Li Pingheng, so there is no need to repeat it. However, during the several months that we were abroad, we witnessed the prevalence of Japanese goods everywhere. Not only could Chinese domestic products not gain a foothold, but the markets for goods from various European and American countries were also almost being occupied by Japanese goods. This really makes us feel that domestic industries and businesses need to be deeply vigilant and strive to improve. Even in this conference, various countries intended to restrict the dumping of Japanese goods, but due to various reasons, no decision was made. However, it can also be seen that various countries' industries and businesses deeply resent the influx of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Representative Attending National Labor</p>
<h3>An Futing Talks About the Labor Conditions in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Labor Treatment is Better Than Ours</p>
<p>Safety Equipment is Increasingly Advanced</p>
<p>丨Draft Report and Submit Three Recommendations丨</p>
<p>The delegation attending the 18th International Labor Conference returned to Shanghai the morning before yesterday. Government representative Li Pingheng was originally scheduled to take the train to Beijing yesterday morning to report to the government. However, due to being busy with various banquets and social events, he changed his departure to last night. Labor representative An Futing is scheduled to go to Beijing within the next day or two to report to the Central Party Headquarters and then return to North China. (Note: Mr. An is the standing director of the trade union of Qixin Cement Company in Tangshan. The Far East News Agency reporter interviewed Representative An at his residence yesterday, and he talked in detail about the labor conditions in various European countries.</p>
<h3>General Situation</h3>
<p>Mr. An first said that after attending the conference, we took the opportunity to visit various countries. Regarding the points we paid attention to during the inspection, Mr. Li (Pingheng) and I had slightly different focuses. Mr. Li, standing from the government's perspective, focused on labor administration. I, standing from the workers' perspective, focused on the workers' lives. Generally speaking, the labor treatment in any European country is better than in our country.</p>
<h3>Swiss Characteristics</h3>
<p>In addition, various countries are vigorously implementing industrial insurance to make it universal. Milan is the industrial center of Italy, with various factories standing in great numbers. Each factory has an organization of worker consumer cooperatives to provide workers with convenience. Among all countries, the labor treatment in Switzerland is the best. Its characteristics are that, in addition to industrial insurance, there is also a kind of social insurance. After workers are old and unable to work, they can enjoy the benefits of social insurance to maintain their lives. Their average wage is three francs per day, which is about three yuan in our currency, compared to the average wage in our country, which is only about four jiao per day. The disparity is so great.</p>
<h3>Working Hours</h3>
<p>As for working hours, all countries stipulate a maximum of eight hours, with Sundays naturally being holidays. However, in our country, there are instances exceeding ten hours, and on Sundays, it's often necessary to work as usual. No wonder workers lament bitterly. At this International Labour Conference, labour representatives also proposed reducing the weekly working hours from forty-eight to forty hours. However, due to opposition from employers or government representatives in some countries, it was not passed and will be discussed again at the sixth conference.</p>
<h3>Safety Equipment</h3>
<p>Mr. An continued to say that factories in various countries pay great attention to safety equipment, and with the government's strict factory inspections, progress is being made daily. Our government is also now paying attention to this and has begun implementing factory inspections. This not only benefits workers but also factory owners. Because if the factory equipment is safe, disasters will be reduced, which surely benefits both labour and capital.</p>
<h3>Workers' Age</h3>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the age of workers, all countries have restrictions, mostly stipulating that the oldest must not exceed sixty years and the youngest must not be less than fifteen years. This is because all countries strictly enforce compulsory education, and those under fifteen are in compulsory education. It's not like the impoverished children in our country, who, due to the lack of educational opportunities, are instead driven by their parents to work.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Female Workers</h3>
<p>Various countries often have restrictions on female workers, and a natural trend has already formed: most women are company clerks, hotel waitresses, and those entering factories to work are gradually decreasing. In Germany, most female workers are adults who have not yet married, and those who are married stay at home to handle household affairs, with only their husbands going out to work.</p>
<h3>Three Suggestions</h3>
<p>Mr. An concluded by saying that he is currently supervising Consultant Cheng (Haifeng) and others in drafting a written report to be taken to the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing to report. It will be released upon arrival in Nanjing. In addition to detailing the conference proceedings and observations, it will also include three suggestions: (1) It is hoped that the government will quickly approve the resolutions of this conference (totalling more than forty items) and gradually implement them; (2) It is hoped that the labour side will strive to produce to help the nation's vitality; (3) It is hoped that the capital side will understand the workers' difficulties and provide more convenience, implementing genuine labour-capital cooperation, etc.</p>

<p>Can the Rickshaw Problem Be Solved?</p>
<h3>Depends on This Morning's Meeting</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Owners Prepare to Present Opinions</p>
<p>All Sectors Attach Great Importance to This Meeting</p>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the public concession's rickshaw problem, due to the mutual insistence between the Rickshaw Committee and the rickshaw owners, has formed a confrontational situation. Organizations such as the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association have repeatedly written to the Municipal Council, noting that rickshaws are heavily related to traffic within the concession and the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers. The Municipal Council's Director-General, Mr. Jones, summoned the rickshaw owners for talks on the third of this month. However, due to both sides still holding their own views, it ended without results. However, to avoid the expansion of the disturbance, Mr. Jones specially ordered the trade association to prepare the minimum set of opinions for amending the new regulations to be presented for open discussion at the meeting at 10 a.m. on the sixth. It is learned that the association has already prepared seven opinions to be presented. Those attending the meeting will include, in addition to the Municipal Council's Director-General Jones, Rickshaw Committee Chairman Massey, Committee Member Yu Qiaqing, and rickshaw owner representative Yin Zhiling. Whether the public concession's rickshaw problem can be resolved in the shortest possible time depends entirely on the results of the meeting on the sixth. Therefore, all sectors attach great importance to this meeting.</p>

Mr. Li told reporters before his departure that this trip has no mission and is purely for handling private affairs. He will be able to return to Shanghai within two weeks.</p>
<p>Gu Xinyi Talks About</p>
<h3>The Process of Purchasing Saigon Rice</h3>
<p>There is Still a Lot of Rice Stored Inland; Rice Merchants are Manipulating Prices</p>
<p>The Situation Between Japan and Russia is Dangerous; Flour Merchants are Hoarding and Raising Prices</p>
<p>The Dabai News Agency reports that this year, due to the severe drought, rice prices have soared. Relevant organizations have proposed ordering foreign rice to alleviate future disasters, while others oppose ordering, believing that it can be maintained. Opinions are divided, and there is no consensus. In order to clarify the truth, a reporter from the Dabai News Agency specially visited Gu Xinyi, a leading figure in the rice industry, yesterday and received a very detailed answer, which is recorded below.</p>
<p>The Truth about Ordering Saigon Rice According to the conversation, a large batch of Saigon rice did arrive in Shanghai recently. Although it was not ordered by the local association, it was indeed contacted by a member of the association serving in the banking sector. It still has the effect of suppressing rice prices and regulating people's food supply. However, given the recent hot weather and still little rainfall, it is indeed necessary to order this foreign rice. There are 12,000 bags of Saigon rice that have arrived in Shanghai, and the second shipment is also expected to be 10,000 bags. If the disaster situation does not decrease, it will continue to arrive one after another in the future. As for the Saigon rice that has arrived in Shanghai, half of it has been sold. When Saigon rice is exported, it is assumed to be 7.2 yuan, plus taxes and fees of 3.5 yuan, for a total of 10.7 yuan. Adding customs declaration and handling fees, the total is more than 11 yuan. The selling price of rice merchants in Shanghai is also based on 11 yuan, so it is entirely voluntary and there is no profit to be made.</p>
<p>The Situation of Rice Storage Inland According to the survey, there is still a lot of rice stored inland. It is estimated that this year will not lead to a rice shortage. The current rice shortage in various places is actually due to the manipulation of a small number of rice merchants. If we want to suppress rice prices, there is no other way than to order foreign rice. As for the autumn harvest situation in various places this year, Wuhu is the best, and Jiangxi and Hunan are also safe. However, it can only take care of its neighbouring provinces. As for other places, if there is no rain, the low-lying fields can be harvested, but the high-lying fields may not have rice to harvest, and a rice shortage is inevitable.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Rise in Wheat and Flour Prices The prices of wheat and flour have also recently soared with rice prices in various places. The reasons are quite complicated, but apart from the wheat production areas mostly being near the Northeast, the puppet regime has made large purchases, leading to high wheat prices. Bad weather and farmers hoarding are important reasons. Furthermore, international affairs are becoming increasingly tense, and there is a possibility of war between Japan and Russia, so most wheat merchants are buying and hoarding to sell at high prices in wartime. As for the rumours that the Japanese will buy a large batch of wheat, it is entirely unfounded. As for the rise in wheat prices, there is no sign of decline for the time being.</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau and Pinghan Railway</p>
<h3>Scheduled to Implement Joint Transportation</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the state-run China Merchants Bureau and the Pinghan Railway have rescheduled to implement joint transportation starting on the 15th of this month. The pontoon for the intermodal transfer station in Hankou is actively being installed, and the waterway at the bottom of the river is being measured. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Measuring the Pontoon Station The intermodal transportation of the Pinghan Railway was originally scheduled to be implemented in May. However, a pontoon custom-made for the intermodal transportation was grounded and damaged during its towing from Shanghai to Hankou for installation. It was repaired and has now been transported to the river surface in Hankou for installation. The China Merchants Bureau considers this station's intermodal transportation to be extremely important and is worried that the weight-laden transport ships may not be able to dock when the water level is low. There is also a deep concern that hard stones may damage the bottom of the ship, so General Manager Liu Hongsheng specially requested the Hydrographic Survey Bureau of the Navy Department to conduct measurements and deepen the river bottom to avoid future impacts.</p>
<p>Implementation of Joint Transportation The China Merchants Bureau and the Pinghan Railway have completed all the procedures for intermodal transportation. The fares for intermodal transportation of goods to various land and water stations are determined by the Pinghan Railway for land routes and by the China Merchants Bureau for water routes. The two parties have exchanged them, and the joint transportation will be implemented on the 15th of this month. The tariff will be announced one day before the start of intermodal transport. Two staff members from the Hankou branch were sent to Shanghai to study the operations and have now returned to Hankou. The Shanghai General Bureau has dispatched Zhou Fengtu, the director of the Intermodal Transportation Section, to Hankou to temporarily oversee everything, as the initial handling of intermodal transport by the Pinghan Railway is bound to be complicated in terms of goods and procedures.</p>
<p>Continued Planning According to the China Merchants Bureau's plan to implement intermodal transportation with railways nationwide, there are eleven major trunk lines. Only the Longhai and Jiaoji Railways have been implemented. After the Pinghan Railway's intermodal transportation is implemented on August 15th, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will be proceeded with. According to Zhou Fengtu, the director of the Intermodal Transportation Section of the Business Department of the China Merchants Bureau, the bureau's continued plans will be carried out on the seven major routes, including the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. It is expected that the national intermodal transport plan can be realized within this year or by February or March of next year.</p>
<h3>Duke Ya Wang Returned to Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Plans to Visit Fujian in the Next Few Days</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Yalenbilei, the Duke of the Right Wing of the 29th Banner of Qinghai, who was ordered to inspect industry and commerce nationwide, arrived in Shanghai and then went to Beijing some days ago to visit the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and discuss matters concerning encouraging investment in Qinghai from all walks of life. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and is scheduled to visit Fujian in the next few days before returning to Qinghai to report on his mission. According to Duke Ya, Qinghai has overlapping exorbitant taxes and levies, and the people's livelihood is declining. He hopes that the authorities will pay attention to abolishing them. As for the banner seal of the 29th Banner, the National Government will cast a new seal and issue it because the current banner seal was issued during the Qing government.</p>
<h3>Measures to Rectify the Changlu Salt Affairs</h3>
<p>Fan Changtai Submitted Suggestions to Chiang</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that Changlu is the largest salt-producing area in our country. In recent years, due to the influence of the political situation in North China, smuggling has become rampant, leading to a sharp decline in tax revenue. Fan Changtai, the former commander of the Anti-Smuggling Brigade, has made suggestions based on his experience to rectify the situation and submitted them to Chairman Chiang for adoption and implementation. The original text is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Submitted to Chairman Chiang A Document Suggesting Rectifying the Changlu Salt Affairs and Strictly Handling Anti-Smuggling, Which Can Increase Revenue by Tens of Millions of Yuan Each Year to Alleviate the National Financial Difficulties. I Hope You Will Review and Approve. I have investigated the Changlu area. The originally set quota for annual sales permits is 4 million dan, with a total annual income of about 20 million yuan. Now, in Changlu, smuggling is rampant. The amount of sea smuggling, nitrate smuggling, neighbouring smuggling, and beach smuggling is more than half, which has a significant impact on national tax revenue. Tracing back to its cause, it lies in the two aspects of the dispersed anti-smuggling organization and the improper use of personnel. If you want to rectify and reorganize, it seems appropriate to select capable personnel to take overall charge of anti-smuggling, so as to assign responsibility. In terms of personnel and administration, you should also strive for openness, prioritizing talent, giving generous treatment, and clearly defining rewards and punishments, so that the tax police officers and soldiers are sincerely convinced and can fulfil their duties. The future of anti-smuggling in the salt affairs will surely have a clear day. By strictly suppressing the bandits, income will surely improve. Thinking about the current days of national treasury hardship, and when suppressing the communists and quelling the chaos, there is an urgent need for funds, there is no way to cut spending, and the source must be opened. The easiest way is to rectify the salt affairs of Changlu and strictly handle anti-smuggling. Changtai has been in Changlu for many years and is deeply aware of the inside story. Seeing the current difficulties, how can I sit idly by? Therefore, in December of last year, I drafted a proposal for rectifying the anti-smuggling affairs of Changlu and submitted it to Your Excellency. On January 4 of this year, I received Your Excellency's order No. 1767 from the Nanchang Camp, stating that the submitted documents had been received in full, and that they had been submitted for the review and instruction of the competent authorities. On February 9 of this year, I received Order No. 13 from the Salt Affairs Office, stating that the submitted documents and attachments had been received in full. After reviewing the proposals for rectifying the anti-smuggling affairs of Changlu, they are not without merit and will be kept for reference. However, it has not been implemented until now, so since Ceng Yangfeng took office as the acting transportation envoy in Changlu, smuggling has been rampant, and tax revenue has not been able to increase much, with a total reduction of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per month. Now, without considering the flaws in the proposal, I have re-drafted a proposal to contribute sincerely in order to repay the country's grace of cultivation. If adopted, it will greatly benefit the country's finances. Therefore, I am submitting this request for review and adoption, and for instructions to be implemented, in order to alleviate the central government's financial difficulties. I cannot express my hopes enough.</p>
<p>Measures to Rectify the Salt Affairs (1) Rectifying the anti-smuggling affairs of Changlu can increase revenue by tens of millions of yuan annually. The military and political expenses of North China have always relied on Changlu's income as a major source of funds. Unfortunately, anti-smuggling has become rampant, leading to a sharp decline in revenue compared to the quota in recent years. After inspecting the Changlu permit quota, the annual quota is 3.83 million dan, while in recent years, the sales volume has only been two-thirds. This is because sea smuggling accounts for about 20%, local nitrate smuggling accounts for about 30%, neighboring smuggling accounts for about 10%, and beach smuggling accounts for about 10%. The annual reduction in sales of official permits is also nearly 3 million dan. This loss to the country is not small. If the salt affairs and anti-smuggling of Changlu are thoroughly rectified, it should be possible to increase revenue by tens of millions of yuan each year. (2) Strictly Reorganize the Anti-Smuggling Organization. The Changlu Anti-Smuggling Team has now been renamed the Tax Police. It no longer handles anti-smuggling and only talks about internal military affairs, and the organization is dispersed, and they cannot contact each other. In such a large area as Changlu, there are only more than 2,000 troops, which is already thin. If they cannot be closely connected, it will not be easy to achieve anti-smuggling success. (3) Severely Suppress Bandits. The bandits in the Changlu area are unusually cunning, which is very different from Lianghuai. The customs of the people are also different. The small number of tax police officers transferred from Lianghuai to Changlu, although familiar with salt affairs, are unfamiliar with the local situation, so anti-smuggling cannot be effective. The salt bandits in Changlu often form groups of hundreds, holding guns and weapons, transporting smuggled salt. The tax police troops are too few in number and often cannot win, or even be insulted by bandits. Even ordinary villagers know that the troops are thin and that the superiors are unwilling to take active responsibility, so it is common to gather crowds to fight and resist arrest with weapons. Without brave and responsible officers leading a considerable number of troops to severely suppress them, it will be difficult to achieve significant results. (4) Measures for the Luandong War Zone and the Nitrate Salt Area of Daming. After the east and west of the Luan River were reduced to war zones, sea smuggling and Liao smuggling were rampant. In the Daming area, the Red Spear Society was rampant, resulting in rampant nitrate smuggling. In these two areas, the situation is very special, so it is necessary to select very capable officers who are suitable for the local conditions and are good at handling anti-smuggling to serve as tax police officers in order to be able to handle it with ease. (5) Protection of the Beaches. The Changlu salt-producing area only has four beaches: Tanggu, Denggu, Xinhe, and Hangu. The area is small, and 600 tax police officers can provide close protection. However, in the plan to reorganize Changlu by the former acting transportation envoy, it is planned to build motor roads outside the beaches, dig moats and canals inside, and levy special taxes to be completed in two years, etc., wasting 500,000 to 600,000 yuan of funds, which is of no benefit to anti-smuggling or tax revenue. If there are such funds, it is enough to recruit a thousand tax police cavalry patrol teams, led by capable personnel who are well-versed in both civil and military affairs and are well-versed in the anti-smuggling affairs of Changlu. They are responsible for severely suppressing the bandits in the entire area. Within one year, smuggling will definitely disappear, and tax revenue will not only not decrease, but it will definitely be possible to increase it by tens of millions of yuan each year. After one year, the infantry will be gradually reduced to meet the original budget. The above five items are only the essentials. If they are adopted and instructed to be implemented, other detailed measures will be submitted separately.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Smuggling Association for Private Cigarettes Will Be Established Today</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Cigarette Business Committee previously appointed responsible persons from Chinese and foreign factories to form a Cigarette Anti-Smuggling Assistance Committee, including Nanyang's Lao Jingxiu, Huacheng's Chen Maonan, Huadong's Li Xuedong, Dadong's Sun Shanli, Lixing's Bao Gengsheng, Cuizhong's Shen Weiting, and British-American's Shen Kunshan. It was originally scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting on the third of the month, but due to the sudden lack of time, it was changed to 3 p.m. today at the Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance. Five people from the Tax Affairs Office will also participate. Once established, work will begin immediately, and the legislative authorities will be requested to draft a special penalty ordinance for merchants who privately manufacture cigarettes so that they will be dealt with according to law after being arrested.</p>

<p>After the Liu Chongwu Case Was Finalized</p>
<h3>Wang Zhaocheng Accused of Supplying Guns and Ammunition</h3>
<p>Wang Firmly Denies, Saying He Was Working for Chen Lifu at the Time</p>
<p>Liu and Others Also Said They Did Not Know Wang and Did Not Supply Arms</p>
<p>Between November 18 and 24 of the year before last, Wang Zhentao, the manager of the Maotai and Hankou stores at 310 Xinzha Road, and Wang Yirong, the partner, were warned by the Anti-Japanese War Veterans' Blood Soul Bandit Elimination Corps for selling inferior goods and ignored the warnings. Subsequently, they were shot in vital parts and died one after another. Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, Tian Shuiyang, and other four criminals who were arrested by the police have been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. It was found that the person who supplied the guns and ammunition was Wang Zhaocheng from Haining, who is at large. He was a member of the Shanghai Citizens' Righteous Army Departure Northeast Engineering Team. At 9:50 a.m. on June 15 of this year, Chinese and Western detectives from the Jiaxing Road Police Station arrested Wang at 75 Anyi Village, 74 Lane, North Shanxi Road, and brought him to the First Special District Court. During the interrogation, he denied the charges, saying that he was working for Mr. Chen Lifu, an important party and government figure in Nanjing at the time. He requested that his lawyer, Jiang Yiping, submit a letter to inquire whether the allegations were true, and to verify them after receiving a reply. He also asked the police station to bring the four defendants, Liu, Pan, Cao, and Tian, to the court for identification. Yesterday morning, the presiding judge Liu Yugui came to the Third Criminal Court for a trial. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, stated that the convicted criminals were all brought in, etc. The defendant's lawyers, Jiang Chi Ping, Sun Biwu, and Jiang Yiping, were represented by Wu Baoqin, who stated that Mr. Chen Lifu was busy with political affairs, going to Shandong and Hunan, and then going to Lushan to discuss important matters, so he had not yet replied to the letter, etc. Liu Chongwu testified that he did not know the defendant and that Zhu Yongxiang, Gao Yongxing, Cao Songshou, and Yu and four others went to warn the foreign goods store on Xinzha Road. He did not carry a bomb. Gao handed the pistol to me. He didn't know about the meeting at Dawangmiao before the event. Tian Shuiyang, Pan Hongsheng, and Cao Songshou all said that the defendant did not participate in going to the two foreign goods stores on Xinzha Road and Hankou Road, and did not supply bombs or guns. He spoke in good conscience and that the police station's accusations were false. When asked, the defendant firmly denied, saying that he was working in the capital for Mr. Chen at the time and that Pan Gongzhan, the Shanghai educator and director, and Wang Yansong, the committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, were all aware of it. He asked for a judgment. Judge Liu instructed that he be taken back into custody and that Lawyer Jiang send another letter to Mr. Chen Lifu to request a review and decision. The court adjourned.</p>

<p>Shanghai Telephone Bureau</p>
<h3>Expand Lines in Various Districts</h3>
<p>Cross-Border Telephones May Be Removed in October</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications reorganized the connection of the Zhabei and Nanshi districts to the concession lines, calls have become more convenient than in the past. The bureau noted that the number of users in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai districts is increasing daily, and the original lines are insufficient. In order to facilitate users' calls, it is planned to expand the lines. As for the Wusong district, communication used to be hindered due to the lack of lines. After the bureau added two pairs of lines, it has become as convenient as usual. Also, the No. 0 switchboard connected to the concession has become busy due to the cancellation of call charges. The Material Procurement Committee of the Ministry of Communications ordered equipment from Germany, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month or early next month. Expansion can be carried out in October. All cross-border telephones that have not been removed will be completely removed after the completion of this project, with the goal of completing all the renovations by the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhongying and Others Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Talk About the Grand Opening of the Zhenjiang Exhibition</p>
<p>Liu Zhongying, Chen Binghui, Wang Hanqiang, and others, the representatives of the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Federation who participated in the Jiangsu Provincial National Exhibition, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after completing their mission in Zhenjiang. According to Liu Zhongying, the provincial exhibition held in Zhenjiang this time has unprecedented scale and layout due to the support of the party and government authorities and the press. Many local people visited the exhibition site every day, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Exhibition Opening According to the conversation, the National Exhibition was originally scheduled to open on the 25th of last month, as agreed with our federation. However, due to the severe drought since the beginning of summer, the river water was dry, and the construction of the venue was delayed due to the inability to transport materials. Therefore, the opening date of the National Exhibition was postponed to August 1st. On that day (the opening day), the Public Auditorium of Boxian Park was used as a ceremonial hall. Although the sun was scorching and the heat was baking, more than 3,000 representatives from various agencies and guests arrived that day. Chen Guofu, the chairman of the provincial government, presided over the unveiling, and Shen Boxian, the representative of the Ministry of Industry, raised the flag. Representatives from the central and Jiangsu provincial party headquarters and various departments also delivered speeches. In addition, the Security Office and the Provincial Public Security Bureau sent military police and bands to the venue to maintain order. The ceremony was extremely solemn and grand.</p>
<p>Overview of the Exhibition Venue The members of our federation and manufacturers departed on the morning of the 22nd of last month and arrived at the Zhenjiang station at about 1 p.m. Representatives from various agencies and military police from the provincial government were already at the station to welcome them in the rain. After getting off the train, Shen Ying and others led all the manufacturers to parade in the important streets of Zhenjiang for publicity. On the second day after arriving in Zhenjiang, they urged the construction workers to work day and night. The construction of the venue was completed on the 27th. Then, the manufacturers calmly arranged the booths. A colorful archway was specially built at the main entrance of the venue, towering into the clouds, which could be seen by looking up from West Gate Street, and the shape was quite spectacular. As for the manufacturers' arrangements, the Tiachu MSG Factory, Huasheng Electric Factory, Taikang Food Company, Sino-French Pharmacy, and Dachina Rubber Factory were particularly competitive, with novel decorations. After the temporary commercial area opened for business on the opening day, because all the manufacturers were purely for publicity purposes and the prices of all the products were determined by the conference, buyers were satisfied and satisfied with the selection. In particular, the Zhenjiang media vigorously promoted it, so more than 15,000 to 16,000 people came to the exhibition to visit and purchase national goods every day. As of the time when Zhongying and others set off the night before, the grand meeting statistic reports that the amount of business done within 3 days came to 53,570 dollars, hence the result of this exhibition in Zhenjiang is optimistically projected.</p>
<h3>Drought and Soaring Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Have Risen by More Than One Yuan in Three Days</p>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has been very hot in recent days, and the Fahrenheit thermometer has risen to over 100 degrees. Although dark clouds were seen in the sky around noon on the past two days, there was still no rain falling, and the room felt unusually muggy. As a result, the source of rice ships in the north and south markets is lacking. According to people in the rice industry yesterday, only ten rice ships arrived in Suzhou River (ie, Wusong River), and the price of rice of all colors has risen by about one yuan per stone in three days. Due to the price limit, the highest price of white rice cannot exceed 13 yuan; otherwise, the highest price of ordinary white rice will be close to 14 yuan per stone.</p>
<p>The Highest Peak of Mount Jiuhua</p>
<h3>Casting a Thirty Thousand Jin Bell</h3>
<p>A Buddhist Initiative in this City</p>
<p>Completion Targeted for the 25th Year of the Republic</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association of this city, the Shanghai Buddhist Association, the Buddhist Pure Land Society, the World Buddhist Laymen's Association, the Jiuhua Buddhist Association, the Shanghai Buddhist Bookstore, and six other organizations have jointly initiated a project to build a bell pavilion on a high peak of Mount Jiuhua in Anhui province and to hang a giant bell weighing approximately 30,000 kilograms. The estimated cost is 48,000 yuan. Li Jingwei drafted the charter, and details were previously reported in the newspaper. The charter has now been finalized and approved by the last regular meeting. The Datong News Agency reporter believes this giant bell will be the largest in the Far East and deserves attention. Therefore, the charter is recorded below: (1) Location: Guanyin Peak of Mount Jiuhua; (2) Bell: Made entirely of copper, weighing approximately 28,000 jin, with the entire Ksitigarbha Sutra engraved around it; (3) Bell Tower: Divided into two levels, the upper level to hang the large bell and house a statue of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, the lower level for living quarters; (4) Deadline: Expected completion by the end of June in the 25th year of the Republic; (5) Preparations: Each initiating organization will nominate three representatives to form a preparatory committee.

Each division will have a director, concurrently held by an executive committee member, and several staff members. The staff members will be nominated by each division director and appointed by the chairman: General Affairs Division, Finance Division, Accounting Division, Construction Division, and Publicity Division; (7) Funding: Set at 48,000 yuan, divided into 24,000 shares, each share being two yuan. Individuals can contribute multiple shares, or two people can jointly contribute one share.</p>
<p>A Robbery at the Yecheng Pawnshop</p>
<h3>Bandits Entered Gently and Exited Forcefully</h3>
<p>Entering by Tunneling Through the Back Door</p>
<p>One Thief Hiding in Zhabei Has Been Arrested</p>
<p>At approximately 3:00 AM on June 12th, three bandits broke into the Yecheng Pawnshop at 1246 Huade Road, robbing jewelry and cash worth over 200 yuan. The incident was reported to the police, who began an investigation. At 4:30 AM the day before yesterday, Hua Detective Hou Fulin of the Yangshupu Police Station and Detective Liu Changgen learned that Shen Yicai, a native of Funing and a suspect in the case, was hiding in a shed on Mayushan Road in Zhabei. They secretly coordinated with detectives from the local Public Security Bureau and arrested Shen at the address. A handgun with 19 rounds of ammunition, 30 yuan in cash, a bag of silver ornaments, and a Mauser rifle with six bullets were found on him and confiscated at the police station. The following morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. A lawyer from the Public Works Department, Li Zhishan, recounted the events, stating that the defendant had tunneled through the back door to enter, entering gently and exiting forcefully, and requested a postponement for further investigation. He then presented the seized guns and ammunition as evidence. Yang Hai, a clerk from the pawnshop, testified that the defendant held a handgun to intimidate them into silence, while one bandit carried an iron bar and flashlight, and another was unarmed. When questioned, the defendant denied the robbery, claiming that the seized items belonged to a friend named Han Er, who was returning to Jiangbei and asked him to deliver them to the North Railway Station. He offered evasive answers. Judge Wu Ze Han ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>Chen Wang, a woman from Jiaxing residing at No. 31 Aiwenyi Road in the Public Concession, is 34 years old and has a long-standing opium addiction. Recently, unable to make a living, she came up with the idea of falsely representing the Chinese Spiritual Hospital to solicit donations from the public to support herself. The day before yesterday, Chen Wang was soliciting donations in the French Concession at the home of Chen Youlin at No. 7 Weinermeng, Suande Lane when Chen discovered that Wang was fraudulently soliciting donations and immediately called the police, who arrested her and brought the donation book, seals, and other items to the police station. The following morning, she was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. According to the police lawyer, the defendant had committed the same offense three times before within the concession. He requested a postponement pending investigation and prosecution. After reviewing the report, the court briefly questioned Wang and ordered her to pay a 500 yuan bail for release, pending further investigation and trial.</p>

<h3>Meeting Record of the South District Rent Reduction Association</h3>
<p>Hoping for Understanding and Mutual Assistance from Landlords</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee held a joint meeting yesterday in the meeting hall of the association in Yongqingli, Minguo Road. More than eighty branches attended. Zhao Bingnan was elected chairman and Ni Yi, a widower, was the secretary. Shen Xinfu gave a report, saying that the association had registered Tianyi Paper and others and sent personnel to investigate. The association sent a letter to the landlord of Pingqiao Road, the famous doctor Zhang Xingruo. A reply was received stating that he supported the bank storing the rent, but the bank turmoil and false pretenses of non-storage would damage the credibility of the organization speaking for the people. The letter further stated that the association should bear complete responsibility for the procedures. The letter was eloquent and sincere. The association's purpose is to revitalize Shanghai and seek common prosperity. Therefore, the association sent letters to landlords and more than 30 people generously agreed to reduce rent. Some landlords had no objection to storing the rent in a bank before the rent reduction was resolved, but were afraid that tenants would not act in accordance with the law or would owe rent in the name of rent reduction. This is regrettable. Today, all branches in this area with sound rent reduction organizations have attended the meeting. A sound strategy for the safety of both parties should be urgently sought so that landlords and tenants can obtain security. The following cases were discussed and resolved: (1) How should rent reduction branches organized in this area be improved? It was resolved that branches that have been verified should be issued with association rules, association signs, committee badges, etc. to identify and conform to a uniform. If there are no such certificates, it means that they are not acting in concert and there are other organizations that have other functions. In addition to denying it in the newspaper, the association will also ask the party and government authorities to thoroughly investigate it. (2) How should we deal with all actions in the name of rent reduction in this area that do not comply with the regulations or register with the association? It was resolved that rent reduction organizations in this area that do not act legally in accordance with the association's regulations will be regarded as destroying the rent reduction group, and the legally acting branches in the whole district will be united to eliminate them. (3) How to help branches that act in accordance with the law if they are oppressed by landlords? It was resolved that the branches organized in accordance with the law in the entire district should take concerted action with strength and material assistance in order to conform to the purpose of coexistence and common prosperity. (4) The association's rent reduction special issue charges a small amount of 20 cents per month and has been approved for presentation. It is urgent to make efforts to develop the case. It was resolved that the second issue will be printed in 100,000 copies and distributed throughout Shanghai, and the charge will be changed to 10 cents per month. However, the payment is voluntary and a stamped receipt must be issued and no extra charge must be demanded. (5) If there is a renter who uses rent reduction as an excuse to actually owe rent or who is acting in accordance with the law and stores rent on a monthly basis, the former has worries and the latter cannot afford to bear it. How should we properly handle the case? It was resolved that the association will not be responsible for guaranteeing the safety of those who do not register with the association and use excuses to owe rent. Those who act in accordance with the law and store the rent monthly will, after the association sends a letter to the landlord, change to storing 90% of the rent after three months, 80% after six months, 70% after nine months, and 60% after more than one year. (6) Those who have not registered with the association or have not received the association's rules, association sign, or committee badge, have one week to complete the registration procedures. Those who have registered must prepare a letter to receive the above items. What should be done if they still do not act accordingly within one week? It was resolved that if they do not comply with this, they will be denied in the newspapers and a request will be made to the party and government authorities to ban their illegal organizations. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>West Gate Area</p>
<h3>Business Community Organizes the Hubin Commercial Association</h3>
<p>The West Gate area of this city is lined with shops. Since the opening of Heping Road, the commerce has become increasingly developed, no less than the bustling commercial areas in the concessions. There are many merchants, but unfortunately there are no entertainment or recreation places. Therefore, in recent times, merchants in the West Gate area have recognized this and initiated the organization of a commercial association and club to connect feelings, research business development, and various recreational activities. From preparation to the present, it has only taken three weeks and it is named the Xicheng Commercial Association. The association is progressing smoothly. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the first founding conference was held on the second floor of the Tiannanlai Restaurant on Heping Road, West Gate. 150 to 160 members attended. The meeting proceeded as scheduled. Hu Zhizeng (Central Clothing Company at the Penglai Road intersection), Zhou Lianqing (Shenda Pharmaceutical Materials), and Hu Chunlin (a sauce and pickle owner) were elected as the presidium. Zhang Jiewen was the secretary and Wei Jie, Ren Xia, Yang Jie, Kong Lilian and others were elected as conference staff. Hu Zhizeng then took the floor to report on the purpose and history of the association. As a result, it was resolved to change the name to the Hubin Commercial Association. All Shanghai merchants can participate. The meeting adjourned for a photograph.</p>

<p>Falsely Claiming to be a Hospital to Defraud Security Deposits</p>
<h3>Students Pursue the Escaped Manager for the Money</h3>
<p>The Second Landlord Impatiently Reports to the Police</p>
<p>Chen Zhenya, president of Dongwu Hospital at No. 99 Jisi Feier Road, Public Concession, and Jiang Guopei, the hospital's manager, advertised for nurses in June of this year. At that time, a large number of people went to take the exam. As a result, dozens of male and female students were admitted, and they were required to pay a security deposit before being admitted to the hospital. Among them, there were more than 20 people who paid security deposits of 106 yuan and 186 yuan, totaling more than 2,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, Chen and Jiang colluded to defraud the money and then fled without a trace. However, the students who were deceived and suffered losses were unwilling to give up and searched separately for the whereabouts of the swindler. Until 5:15 PM the day before yesterday, they found out that Jiang Guopei was hiding in Hua Yuanmo's house at No. 1124 Lane 1, Xinzha Road. More than 20 male and female students sent Yan Bohan as the male representative and Sun Meiying as the female representative to visit Jiang Guopei at Hua's house to negotiate and demand the return of the money. However, Jiang was well-informed and had already fled when he heard the news. Therefore, the student representatives and the second landlord Hua Yuanmo went to the master of crimes to question him, arguing with each other. Hua reported the situation of the students' quarrel to the Gordon Road Police Station, which immediately sent Detective No. 26 to investigate the address. Seeing that there were many students, they were taken back to the police station on the spot. After the West Detective investigated, he found that the area was under the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Police Station, so the Gordon Road Police Station transferred more than 20 male and female students to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for verification.</p>
<h3>Park Guard Assaults and Humiliates Tourists</h3>
<p>The Case Was Settled After Mediation by the Judge</p>
<p>Two accountants, Chen Haosheng's office, are located at No. 47 Ningbo Road. At 7:30 PM on the 25th of last month, Chen and his wife and a young son went to the Bund Park to enjoy the cool. The couple both had long-term entry tickets, but suddenly forgot them at home, which was obstructed by the ticket collector, No. 69 Huabu, Zhu Dade from Shanxi. He was asked to purchase a ticket to make up for it. Chen then gave Zhu two dimes of foreign money. Unexpectedly, Zhu wanted to extort money. After Chen negotiated and demanded the return of the money, he went to the ticket office to purchase a ticket and entered the park. He also accused the officer of not engaging in private fraud, which angered Zhu. He stepped forward and slapped Chen in the face. A conflict ensued. Tourists Hong Xiaogang and Tian Huaying persuaded them to disperse. Afterwards, Chen sent a letter to the Police Department of the Public Works Department, requesting an investigation. He also hired lawyer Yu Congdao to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Zhu of public insult. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhou Chengjin opened the Eighth Criminal Court for interrogation. Zhu also hired lawyer Ye Shaoying to defend him. According to Zhu, his wife did not have a ticket at the time, so I asked her to purchase a ticket. The plaintiff asked me not to be harsh. I didn't agree. He scolded me as a slave to the country and a running dog. I wanted to drag him to the park management office, but I stopped after someone persuaded me. There was no slapping. In court, the matter was extremely minor, and reconciliation was advised. Under the mediation of the two lawyers, Zhu apologized to accountant Chen in court. Chen then withdrew the case, and Judge Zhou ruled that the case would not be accepted. A slap lawsuit was concluded.</p>

They lived together at No. 40 Baogeng Lane, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Because Ms. Li was infertile, Li married a concubine, and they lived together, bearing two sons and one daughter. The family was generally harmonious. However, due to the recent ban on gambling, Li became idle, and the couple often argued about it. A few days ago (the 4th), the couple quarreled over a trivial matter. Ms. Xu suddenly had a pessimistic thought and secretly swallowed raw opium to kill herself.

<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<h3>Investigation into Stevedores' Wage Increase Request</h3>
<p>The case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's stevedores requesting a wage increase was originally mediated by the Seamen's Union and the Shipping Mutual Aid Association. The Mutual Aid Association believes that the prohibition of privately carrying goods and the cancellation of small gratuities are not grounds for requesting a wage increase, especially since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is currently under orders to reduce staff and salaries. They plan to find other ways to achieve the goal of a wage increase. The Seamen's Union, on the other hand, believes that the Mutual Aid Association has no sincerity in mediation and intends to withdraw from the mediation, allowing the workers to act freely. It is also rumored that they are brewing a work slowdown. The exchange of official letters between the two associations is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from the Seamen's Branch: Regarding the case of the China Merchants stevedores requesting a wage increase and improved treatment, we previously submitted the reasons and conditions for the wage increase and repeatedly requested your association to investigate and handle it and hoped to receive a reply. Now, representatives from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's stevedores have come to our union, demanding that the case be resolved immediately, otherwise they will take free action. Based on this, the case has been delayed for eight or nine months due to mutual evasion between the company and your association. The stevedores' desire to achieve their goal is at its peak. If it is delayed any further, our union may not be able to persuade them to remain calm. We are writing again to request that your association investigate, consider carefully, and reply immediately regarding all the conditions of this case to avoid disputes and maintain public friendship.</p>
<p>Reply from the Shipping Mutual Aid Association: We have received your letter stating (repeating the original letter) to avoid disputes. We have investigated and found that the salaries of the China Merchants stevedores are already higher than those of other companies. After the wage increase request occurred last year, both parties investigated, filled out forms, and submitted them to the Ministry. Whether or not a wage increase should be granted is a matter for the Ministry to decide fairly. We cannot allow the workers to threaten with words of free action. Our association has repeatedly considered the matter with the business director and believes that the stevedores' reasons for requesting a wage increase, such as the prohibition of privately carrying goods and the cancellation of small gratuities, resulting in a reduction of personal income, are not valid. The carrying of private packages and small gratuities are long-standing malpractices of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and are not allowed by law. However, the losses suffered by the business director due to the cancellation of the above malpractices are more than double those of the workers. Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is currently undergoing reorganization, they are enduring the pain for a time to seek remedies. Your association must be aware of the situation and will not allow villains to disrupt the situation and cause the situation to escalate, hindering the state-owned transportation business. As the leader of all seamen, your association should earnestly persuade them to wait for the Ministry's decision or wait for the business of each ship to improve slightly, and then find other ways to reduce the suffering of the workers. Then our association members will also benefit. If an unfortunate situation occurs at this time, the responsibility for it will be fairly judged. We are writing in response for your reference.</p>

<h3>Labor-Management Dispute in the Bean Curd Industry</h3>
<p>Eighth District Party Headquarters Mediates</p>
<p>Daily Wage Increase of Four Cents</p>
<p>The bean curd workers in Wusong have requested an increase in wages because the cost of living has reached an extreme, while their daily wages are only a meager 2 jiao 7 fen, which is not enough to cover expenses. However, the employers refused to increase wages, so yesterday more than 20 workers, including Sheng Yuesheng, petitioned the Eighth District Party Headquarters. Standing Committee Member Wang Chenge met with them and inquired about the details. The District Party Headquarters then notified the employers to come to the site for mediation. Three solutions were agreed upon: (1) Starting from the date of mediation, there will be a daily increase of four cents, making each worker's wage 3 jiao 1 fen; (2) If a worker resigns, they must give three days' notice. When employers hire new workers, they can only receive the new employee bonus after working for seven days; (3) Workers must absolutely obey the shop rules, otherwise the shop owner will report to the District Party Headquarters for punishment. With this agreement reached, both labor and management were willing to comply and dispersed.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Wuxi Highway is Being Rushed for Construction</p>
<h3>Deadline is the End of Next Month for Full Completion</h3>
<p>Shanghai Merchants Pledge Another 300,000</p>
<p>The Suzhou-Jiaxing Road Has Also Started Construction</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong She, the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, constructed by the Construction Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, has been progressing actively since construction began in sections in April of this year. The Southeast Transportation Fair will be held on October 10th, and the entire highway project is required to be completed within two months. The Suzhou-Jiaxing Road has also started construction. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Deadline for Completion of Shanghai-Wuxi Highway: The Shanghai-Wuxi Highway is a combination of the Xidang section and the Changhu section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, making it the largest trunk road in Jiangnan. The entire road is 200 kilometers long, starting from Baoshan Road in Shanghai, passing through Zhenru, Nanxiang Jiading, Taicang, Changshu, and reaching Wuxi (the Changshu-Wuxi section is a branch line). Construction of the entire road began in sections on April 20th of this year. It was originally scheduled to be completed in September. However, due to the sectional surveying and the different start dates, as well as the large number of bridges (149) and culverts, it could not be completed as scheduled. Shen Baixian, the head of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, came to Shanghai recently to inspect the road and ordered the highway preparation office to ensure that it is completed by the end of September, so that the provincial highway joint opening ceremony can be held on schedule, as the Southeast Transportation Fair will be held on October 10th and the road is included in the fair.</p>
<p>Merchants Pledge Another 300,000: Shen Baixian, the head of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, said that the total cost of the Xihu Highway is 1.4 million national currency, which is shared by the government and merchants. The government has borrowed 40% of the road construction funds from the National Economic Commission, but the merchants have only paid 50,000 yuan so far. The 1st and 2nd installments of 150,000 yuan have not been paid on time. Since the start of construction, the cost has reached more than 600,000 yuan, all of which has been covered by the Construction Department. Shen came to Shanghai recently and contacted Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, gentry merchants Jin Tingsun, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Rong Zongjing, Shi Liangcai, etc. As a result, they agreed to pay 300,000 national currency first, and the rest will be paid on time, so there is no problem with funding.</p>
<p>Construction of Suzhou-Jiaxing Road Begins: The Suzhou-Jiaxing Road starts from Suzhou, passes through Wujiang, Beiting, Pingwang, Shengze, Wangjiangjing, Shuangqiao, etc., and reaches Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province. The entire line is 75 kilometers long. The Suzhou-Shengze section was completed long ago and was put into trial operation on June 15. As for the Wangjiangjing to Jiaxing section, the roadbed is soft, making travel unsafe. The section is 23 kilometers in Jiangsu and 37 kilometers in Zhejiang and urgently needs to be constructed. The Jiangsu section has been surveyed and construction has begun. The Zhejiang section is under survey and construction will begin soon.</p>
<p>Xinwei Relief Association</p>
<h3>Sends a Large Group of Refugees Back Home</h3>
<p>A Group of Thirty-Two People</p>
<p>Embark on the Xinfeng Ship to Tianjin</p>
<p>The Xinwei Relief Association received a letter from the Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai, sending 29 refugees, including Huang Baozhong and Tan Yingrong. The Social Affairs Bureau sent three refugees, including Wang Dongcheng, for a total of 32 people, all from Hebei Province. They came to Shanghai this year to build highways in Zhejiang Province. The wages they were supposed to receive were embezzled and absconded by the foremen, leaving them with nothing. The journey home was long and difficult, so they requested assistance to avoid becoming vagrants. Based on the letters from both organizations, the association immediately sent staff members Ge Yunxun and Chen Hongyou to investigate and confirmed the facts. They issued 32 ship tickets and ordered officials to send the refugees to the China Merchants Wharf to board the Xinfeng ship, which set sail at 7 a.m. yesterday, transporting them to Tianjin, where they will return to their respective hometowns.</p>
<h3>Unidentified Female Corpse in the Small Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>Face Covered in Opium Residue, Apparently Died of Illness</p>
<p>Yesterday, the prosecutor's office of the local court received a report from Gu Xueyuan, the headman of the fifth district, stating that an unidentified female corpse had been found in the small vegetable market in Tangjiawan, Ximen. She was approximately 40 years old, wearing a gray striped short shirt and black gauze pants, with small feet, resembling someone from out of town. No family members were found. He requested an autopsy. After receiving the report, the court immediately appointed Prosecutor Wu Deying and a forensic team to the scene. The examination revealed that the female corpse's face was covered in opium residue, she was emaciated, and she was apparently addicted. There were no other injuries, so it was determined that she had died of illness. The court ordered the donation of a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>The Grandeur of the Xu Garden Lantern Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Hainin Lantern Art Exhibition at Xu Garden on Connaught Road in Shanghai opened on the 4th. Ticket sales began at 4 p.m. that afternoon, and people from all walks of life flocked to see it, creating a very lively atmosphere. The internal layout of the garden was ingenious. Among all the lanterns, the S維 Pavilion was the most meaningful, containing the four virtues (禮義廉恥) and aligning with the New Life Movement. Others include the Magpie Bridge, Lotus Boat, Green Shade, and Willow Pavilion, all exquisitely crafted, intricately carved, and adorned with colored electric lights, creating a unique and refreshing experience. There was also a lion dance stage, symbolizing the awakening of the people. The Chrysanthemum Hall was filled with hundreds of flowers in a variety of colors, full of life. The figures and landscapes painted on the more than twenty paper umbrellas were all works by famous artists, with incredibly detailed needle-punched holes. At 11 o'clock, famous fireworks from Pinghu were set off, earning a lot of applause from the audience. It is said that more than 3,000 tickets were sold on the previous two nights, which shows the grandeur of the event.</p>

<h3>City News</h3>
<p>Domestic Machine Oil Sales are Booming: Our country's science is flourishing, and the use of machinery is very extensive, so the need for machine oil is also very large.

<h3>Movies</h3>
<p>"Woman" Premieres at the Great Shanghai: The Great Shanghai Theater on Tibet Road is the first-class theater in Shanghai. It usually shows high-end foreign films and has never shown domestic films.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Respectfully, I recently read the news column of your newspaper, "Mother Accuses Son and Daughter-in-Law of Committing Murder", and the content contains inaccuracies. After investigation, our lawyer stated in court that it was unfortunate that the mother, son, daughter-in-law, and mother-in-law were in court, and it would be best to follow the court's instructions to have the plaintiff withdraw the lawsuit so that the mother could be kind and the son could be filial and restore their relationship. As for what your newspaper published, Zheng Shuming and Cheng Huang have a special relationship, and the food and lodging are provided by her, etc., our lawyer did not make such a statement. Please correct this to show the truth. I would be grateful for this. Sincerely, lawyer Sun Zuji, August 5.</p>

<h3>What are International Issues (Continued)</h3>
<p>| Reply to Mr. Gu Qianli</p>
<p>In the minds of people in the past, the concept of the world was an abstract, vast, and boundless thing. Many bizarre legends tell us about the process of humankind's understanding of the world. However, thousands of years of human experience, especially the extraordinary efforts of the last two or three hundred years, have completely overturned the old ideas. They know that although the Earth is infinitely larger than an individual, compared to the vast and boundless universe, the Earth is just a small pebble. At the same time, because humans have made a much greater leap in overcoming nature than in the past, the Earth has also shrunk in people's minds. Previously, human activities were limited by the set of this stage, and they had to submit to nature. Now, thanks to the progress of science and the development of the economy, almost all natural obstacles have been removed. In the past, caravans of camels traveled in groups, swaying along, but now most of them have been replaced by railway trains. The ocean, once considered impossible to cross, is now dotted with toy-like steamships and warships. The mountain passes, once marveled at as insurmountable, are now gracefully crossed by dragonfly-like airships and airplanes. The astonishing progress of other instruments of civilization has transformed the world today. Now we can fly in airplanes from one side of the Earth to the other in a week. If you don't want to move yourself, you can stay at home, sitting comfortably on the sofa, and talk and chat with friends all over the world using wireless telegraphs and wireless telephones. You can also use facsimile machines to personally see the colors and smiles of your loved ones tens of thousands of miles away. In reality, the Earth has changed, and a thousand miles has been shortened to one mile.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is the result of countless changes in the world, and it is still constantly changing. In short, the set of this stage is now at the disposal of the actors, who can do whatever they want. Naturally, nature no longer dares to be naughty with humans. This lively stage will be performing even newer and more wonderful comedies day by day!</p>
<p>(2) Drama and Characters</p>
<p>I don't want to say much about the tragedies and comedies of humans in the past, because this should be told by history teachers, and I don't want to recite the play script again. Now, let's talk about the signature dramas that humans have been playing since the emergence of countries! No! Talking like this still requires reciting thousands of years of history! Before we trace this history, let's explain the drama currently being played! There are currently fifty-nine independent countries in the world, but among these fifty-nine stars, there are no more than ten outstanding figures like Hu Die and Xu Lai. They are now the pillars of this stage, arrogantly performing. Do you want to understand the current drama? It's so complicated that you can't imagine. Even this book can only offer some approaches to the study of the play script and cannot provide a comprehensive explanation! However, even so, the name of this famous play can be stated first; it is called international issues.</p>

<h3>Records of the Drifting Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Underneath their feet, there was a carpet about two inches thick, laid throughout the entire small court; its material was velvet, its color was light blue, which was beautiful enough, not to mention that it was covered with clusters of golden patterns, all of which were peonies and phoenixes among birds, and it could indeed be praised as "magnificent."</p>
<p>The window openings in this room were not as wide as the windows in the Empress Dowager's bedroom, with a ratio of about three to two. The reason these windows were narrower than the former was intentional. So why did they intentionally make them this way? It's actually quite funny: because the Empress Dowager had a very strong hobby, which was to enjoy playing with all her own treasures. When she decided to go to Fengtian, she also thought of taking some of her jewelry and antiques on the train. Although she didn't explicitly tell me, or Qing Shan, or Li Lianying, we all understood it early on based on her usual hobbies. So Qing Shan, while supervising the construction of the special train for the Empress Dowager, came up with a plan to make the car windows smaller, leaving some gaps in the middle, and added many small shelves of different styles to these gaps to prepare for the Empress Dowager to place those treasures. This design was greatly appreciated by the Empress Dowager. Before she got on the train, she was busy telling people to put those treasures up first, and after getting on the train, she looked around in a daze, as if she had never seen them before.</p>
<p>Although the windows were relatively narrow, the curtains hanging on them were even more exquisite than those used in the small bedroom. The curtains themselves were still made of ordinary yellow satin without embroidery, but there was an additional row of short tassels made of gold thread at the bottom, which made them look even better.

<h3>Street Libraries</h3>
<p>— Kong Jie</p>
<p>In Shanghai, small book stalls can be seen on almost every street, neatly displaying many comic book series. For a few copper coins, you can rent several books, so they can be called "street libraries." Books like "Eight Swords and Sixteen Knights," "Immortal Mountain Strange Knights," and "Little Fool" represent the entire library's catalog. Rickshaw pullers, maids, servants, and even the ladies of the house are customers of these libraries. The most frequent borrowers are children, and this is not difficult to observe.</p>
<p>I believe that this type of book is not suitable for children and should be actively prohibited, because what these books describe is either absurd and groundless ghost stories or obscene and unbearable nonsense. This causes at least some kind of mental destruction to children who know nothing. I remember that many incidents of apprentices and others leaving home to practice asceticism occurred, and these small books were a contributing factor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these small books are passed around by many people, so it is inevitable that infectious germs will be attached to them. After children read them, they use their hands, which carry infectious germs, to grab food or spread diseases.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to sincerely say to parents: It is best to buy beneficial books for your children to read. As for these small books, it is better for children to have no books to read and let them play around than to let them read these books.</p>
<p>These are just some of my humble opinions. What do you parents think?</p>
<h3>Foreign Wives</h3>
<p>— Tian Huiweng</p>
<p>Wives are always needed by men. Moreover, few men do not love their wives; even fewer do not fear them. This principle is probably undeniable even by great psychologists.</p>
<p>Although the famous French novelist, Mr. Goethe Parra, said that the contours of Chinese women's faces mostly resemble "flatbreads," round and chubby with a flat nose, just like "flatbreads." When they become wives, aren't these "flatbreads" as lovable as "pancakes" when we are hungry?</p>
<p>Even if the lower part of the face becomes an acute angle, don't men call it a "melon seed face?" Isn't the oval contour called an "egg face?" As for the models like the big Ah Fu from Wuxi, wives with a blessed appearance are like that ninety-nine percent of the time. How could the husbands not like them, not love them, and not fear them?</p>
<p>What we find strange are the foreign wives in the homes of some returned students. High nose bridges, yellow eyes, and a special aura. At first, we thought that a yellow dog seeing a black dog would be as beautiful as Xi Shi; a calico cat seeing a black cat would be as beautiful as Wang Zhaojun. Since they are all of the same kind, beauty and love would naturally arise. Unexpectedly, our returned students also develop a special sense of beauty towards foreign wives. Therefore, they do not marry local wives but marry foreign wives.</p>
<p>My friend's mother is a Japanese wife, but she loves China very much, and of course, she loves her husband and children even more. She has no modern habits at all; she is very diligent and frugal in washing clothes and cooking. When she has nothing to do, she lights a censer and chants "Amitabha" repeatedly. Japanese wives are indeed "good wives and loving mothers." It is said that French wives, American wives, and British wives are more difficult to serve. Their material comforts are relatively luxurious. It is ultimately impossible for them to live a large family life. Many brothers who have married foreign wives and returned to China must be active in politics; if they are friends who are teachers, how can they afford to support them? Therefore, it is better not to marry a foreign wife. If you are happy to marry a foreign wife to broaden your horizons, a "Japanese product" is also suitable!</p>
<h3>The Northeast Four Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirty-Two: The General Delights in Sensory Pleasures All Day Long; Few Soldiers Return While the Old and Young Weep</p>
<p>It's really true what they say, you meet people everywhere. Wasn't there a soldier who came to our house for help the winter before last? Somehow, he ended up as a guard for the whole family. When he saw me, he told me that if I wanted to inquire about news, I could ask at the wounded soldiers' hospital. If an entire battalion was scattered, the ones who were doing well would gather at the regimental headquarters, and the wounded would always be sent to the hospital for treatment. If you can't find him in either of these two places... I thought, wouldn't it be impossible to find him? The old man was very pitiful, and he was unwilling to say even such a disappointing thing. Jiang also knew what he meant and said, "When are you going to inquire?" Zhao Weng said, "I'll go right away." Gui Zhi said, "The fire was opened the day before yesterday, will there be wounded soldiers returning today?" Zhao Weng said, "That doesn't matter; I'll go and take a look first." He didn't finish his words, and he had already walked far away. In fact, while Gui Zhi was saying this, she was hoping that Zhao Weng would return early and report news, saying that Zi Qiang had been shot in the leg and was lying in the hospital. So, she first hoped that Zhao Weng would go quickly, and after he left, she eagerly hoped that he would return. After about two or three hours, Zhao Weng came in with a sad face. Before Gui Zhi could ask, he shook his head and said, "Those wounded people are very pitiful. I hope our Zi Qiang, with the blessing of the Heavenly Bodhisattva, won't be wounded." This old man never used to be superstitious. Why is he saying such superstitious words today? There must be another reason behind this. So, she said to Zhao Weng, "At your age, you have to take things in stride. Don't go tomorrow; let me go and take a look." Zhao Weng said, "You are pregnant; you can't go there. It's a long way away. I think Zi Qiang's division headquarters has an office in Beiping. Asking there might be better than asking at the hospital. Think about it, Zi Qiang isn't wounded, why would he run to the hospital?"

<h3>Loyal and Filial Descendants</h3>
<p>— Hidden</p>
<p>Books are closely related to a person's character and conduct. Looking at the upright gentlemen and great scholars of ancient times, even those who are not famous for calligraphy and painting still possess outstanding qualities in their occasional works. The Tang family of Wujin, known for its loyalty and filial piety, has had every piece of paper and word treasured by the art world, which is no accident. The great-great-grandson, Dingzhi, is skilled in both calligraphy and painting, surpassing the ordinary and vulgar, just like his person. He cannot be compared to those who strive for victory by leaning towards danger and eccentricity in modern times. Anyone who appreciates Tang's calligraphy and painting will not consider my words to be wrong.</p>
<h3>Sweatdrops</h3>
<p>— (Cheng Ming)</p>
<p>A pen works hard all morning, but it's still not as good as a dancer's jump. From this, it can be proven that the hand of a scholar is not as good as the foot of a dancer.</p>
<p>The sweat of a modern girl is fragrant sweat. The sweat of a laborer is stinky sweat. They are the same kind of sweat, but they have two different smells?</p>
<p>The legs of a rickshaw puller and a vendor are swift legs. The legs of a young lady are jade legs. They are the same kind of legs, but they have two different names.</p>
<p>After smoking most of a cigarette, about one-third of the cigarette butt is discarded on the ground. If there are one million cigarette smokers among the three million residents of this city, and each person discards cigarette butts worth one cent of silver per day, that would be thirty thousand yuan per day, nine hundred thousand yuan per month, and ten million and eighty thousand yuan per year. Using this to run public welfare projects or industrial factories would be quite considerable. This is just considering cigarettes. If we calculate the other discarded items, the amount would be multiplied dozens of times.</p>
<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3>Balsam</h3>
<p>— (Xin Ren)</p>
<p>Balsam, what a beautiful and harmonious name. Perhaps because of this beautiful name, I have a special fondness for this unappreciated herbaceous balsam.</p>
<p>Every morning after getting up, I push open the east window and see the balsam first. There are five plants in total, and although they were all planted at the same time, they grow to different heights. Is this because the rain and dew also have favoritism?</p>
<p>When I have nothing to do, I lean on the window sill and look at the balsam. When I feel depressed, I also look at the balsam. The balsam doesn't relieve my depression, but it is a companion in my loneliness. Because I live in this world, I am as lonely as the balsam.</p>
<p>In the evening, I water the balsam. The balsam seems to understand the kindness of the waterer, and the withered long leaves sprout with fresh green. Perhaps in a few days, the balsam will bloom with delicate and beautiful flowers, but I don't hope that the balsam will repay me in this way. My only purpose is for the balsam to live.</p>
<p>This afternoon, I walked alone to the window and saw a hairy caterpillar with thorns crawling on the tender branch of the balsam. The caterpillar was chewing on the long leaves of the balsam. As I watched, a pang of sorrow floated in my heart.</p>
<p>Of course, it is my undeniable duty to remove the caterpillar for the balsam and remove the cobwebs between the leaves.</p>
<p>Under the gentle moonlight, the universe takes shape,</p>
<p>Thorns are covered with leaves of sympathy.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but recite my friend's poem like this. Recited it out loud.</p>
<h3>Crape Myrtle</h3>
<p>Crape myrtle is a deciduous semi-arboreal tree, now in bloom,</p>
<p>with several panicles on one branch and several flowers on one panicle. A gentle breeze blows through the branches, making it charming and lovely.</p>
<p>Crape myrtle blooms in early summer and begins to wither in August and September, hence the name "Hundred Day Red." If you grab its trunk and branches with your hand, it will shake, hence the name "Tickle Flower." Youyang Zazu says, "In the north, crape myrtle is called Monkey Scaffolding Tree, because it has no bark, and monkeys cannot climb it."</p>
<p>Crape myrtle is mostly purple, with some white and red colors. In Fujian Province, there are light red ones, which bloom extremely profusely and brilliantly like fire.</p>
<p>My maternal grandfather, Mei Chu Gong, once saw an extremely large crape myrtle tree in Huang County, Shandong, with a circumference of about several arm spans. Many people prostrated themselves before it. When he asked the villagers, they said that this was the crape myrtle god and could cure people's diseases.</p>
<p>To propagate this tree, you can use the air layering method, which involves using two separable flower tubes or flower pots to surround the branch used for planting, tightly binding it with straw and other materials around it, and paying attention to watering it without any negligence. Wait until roots grow, and then plant it.</p>
<p>People in the past greatly loved crape myrtle. The Tang dynasty poet Bai Juyi wrote, "In the Silken Edict Pavilion, writing is quiet; in the Bell and Drum Tower, the clepsydra runs long. Sitting alone at dusk, who is my companion? The crape myrtle flower faces the crape myrtle officer." The Song dynasty poet Yang Wanli wrote, "Bright clouds brightly cover the eaves, crimson snow softly dots the steps. Don't mind that I am not an incense table official, I also move my bed to face the crape myrtle flower." They all loved it very much. Also, "Seeming foolish and drunk, weak yet beautiful, dew presses wind, bullying extraordinarily obliquely. Who says that flowers are not red for a hundred days? Crape myrtle blooms for half a year." Written casually, it is naturally fitting.</p>
<h3>Hollyhock</h3>
<p>— (Liu Zhiming)</p>
<p>The world says that the poppy's beauty surpasses all flowers, but I always thought otherwise. The hollyhock's beauty surpasses it. This flower has many varieties and colors: red ones like drunken faces, white ones like jade souls, purple ones like evening clouds, crimson ones like autumn maples, and black ones like smoky ink. Sparse stems and dense leaves, with many beautiful flowers, cannot let the poppy monopolize the beauty.</p>
<p>The leaves of the hollyhock can be collected to dye paper colors, clear and elegant, which is what was called hollyhock in the past.</p>
<p>An old poem says, "One flower is like a hibiscus flower, the leaves are like hibiscus leaves. A five-foot railing cannot cover it, still leaving half for people to see." It is about this flower. The hollyhock flower is like a hibiscus, the leaves are like hibiscus leaves, and the stem is six or seven feet tall. People in Zhejiang call it "One-Zhang Red."</p>
<p>The Tang dynasty poet Chen Biao wrote a poem about hollyhocks, "What can I do with the hollyhocks in front of me? Hundreds of plants, light purple and deep red. How much can they compete with the peony? They are lightly regarded only because there are many of them." Things are valued for their rarity, and I sigh for the hollyhock flower.</p>

<h3>Inter-Port Tennis Causes a Sensation in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Shanghai Retains the Tigard Cup</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Bonner-Fischer Doubles Also Won</p>
<p>Long Qian Brothers Fight Bitterly for Five Sets and Ultimately Lose</p>
<p>Today, Lin Baohua vs. Little Long Qian is Irrelevant to the Championship</p>
<p>(Tianjin, 5th) In the inter-port tennis match this afternoon, the first doubles was Fischer-Bonner of Shanghai against Little Long Qian and Er Long Qian of Tianjin. The result was 3-2, with Shanghai winning against Tianjin. The scores were 6-4, 9-7, 2-6, 1-6, 7-5. In total, Shanghai has already won three sets first, retaining the Tigard Cup championship with a score of 3-1. Tomorrow's singles match between Lin Baohua and Little Long Qian is no longer relevant to the championship.</p>
<h3>The Courts Are Full, and the Competition is Fierce</h3>
<p>The inter-port tennis match was held this afternoon at 5:00 PM at the British court. The first doubles match was Fischer-Bonner against Er Long Qian and Little Long Qian. The audience was still extremely crowded. Both one-dollar-and-fifty-cent seats were declared full half an hour before the match. Many latecomers stood in the scorching sun to watch. Today is the key moment for both sides in the championship. Shanghai has already won one singles and one doubles match each, while Tianjin has won one singles match. If Shanghai wins today's doubles match, then tomorrow's singles match between Lin Baohua and Little Long Qian will not matter even if they lose. Tianjin will also have no hope of winning the championship if they lose today's doubles match. Therefore, both sides competed with all their might.</p>
<h3>Bitter Five-Set Battle: Shanghai Wins</h3>
<p>In the first set, Bonner and Neeson effectively used their blocking skills to target their opponents' weaknesses, while Carlson provided support in the backcourt. They won the first set 6-4.</p>
<p>In the second set, the Erlong Qian brothers were very active, hitting high balls with backhands. Bonner and Carlson were eager for points, hitting many balls out of bounds. After a hard-fought battle, they barely managed to defeat their opponents 9-7.</p>
<p>In the third set, Xiaolong Qian used line drives for a strong counterattack, which troubled Carlson and Bonner. As a result, they lost 2-6.</p>
<p>In the fourth set, the Erlong Qian brothers' blocking and serving were powerful, creating a favorable momentum. Carlson and Bonner were controlled by their opponents and lost again 1-6.</p>
<p>The fifth set was crucial, and the atmosphere became very tense. From the serve to the last game, both sides attacked relentlessly. When the score was tied at 4-4, Erlong Qian jumped to receive a high ball from Carlson, but unfortunately strained a muscle and fell to the ground. After medical treatment, he struggled to continue playing. Carlson seized the opportunity and attacked his side, leading to a 6-5 lead. In the last game, they tied, but Carlson managed to hit a powerful backhand, securing the final victory. The inter-port tennis championship thus went to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Carlson, Bonner, and Neeson (Shanghai): 6-4, 9-7, 2-6, 1-6, 7-5</p>

<h3>Yesterday's YMCA Performance</h3>
<p>Busy with Receptions All Day, No Time to Rest</p>
<p>Today's Performance at Gaoqiao Seaside</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the "Mermaid" Yang Hsiu-chiong in Shanghai, the city's sports and swimming communities, as well as enthusiastic sports supporters, have been in high spirits. They have been hosting banquets and inviting her to perform. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, she performed at the YMCA on Sichuan Road, and today at 2:00 PM, she will go to Gaoqiao. Every day, in addition to swimming performances, she also has to attend various receptions, making her extremely busy. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Crowded Viewing. The Shanghai YMCA Physical Education Department had already telegraphed an invitation to Yang Hsiu-chiong and her family before they left Jiangxi, requesting them to perform during their visit to Shanghai. After Ms. Yang and her family arrived in Shanghai, the department secretary, Mr. Qian Yiqin, contacted them again the night before, and they agreed to perform at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The YMCA limited the number of entry tickets to 300 due to the limited space in the swimming pool, but more than a thousand people came to claim tickets, drawn by Yang's fame. The YMCA issued an additional 200 tickets, so there were more than 500 spectators in the room yesterday, standing shoulder to shoulder and filling the entire space. Those who arrived later had no room to stand.</p>
<p>The YMCA swimming pool is located in the lowest level, below the auditorium. The pool is about 40 feet long and 15 meters wide. The pool water was specially changed, and the white tiles at the bottom of the pool were clearly visible under the electric lights. At 3:30 PM, Yang Hsiu-chiong arrived with her parents and siblings. Except for her mother, who does not know how to swim, all four family members changed into black swimming suits. Yang Hsiu-chiong wore a white swimming cap, and her demeanor was calm and graceful. The Yang family came to the pool side, and Mr. Yang Yihui of the YMCA explained the importance of swimming for health and thanked Ms. Yang and her family for their performance. Then, Mr. Lu Ganchen of the YMCA introduced the Yang family to the audience. Finally, Ms. Yang's father, Yang Zhunan, announced the program for today's performance.</p>
<p>Family Performance. The first to enter the water was (1) Yang Zhunan, swimming the side stroke. Next, (2) Hsiu-chiong, Hsiu-chen, and Chang-hua, swimming the crawl. (3) Zhunan and Hsiu-chen changed to the American crawl (four times back and forth). (4) Hsiu-chiong and Chang-hua performed the breaststroke (four times back and forth). (5) Zhunan did the backstroke. (6) Hsiu-chiong did the backstroke and crawl (four times back and forth). (7) Hsiu-chen and Chang-hua did the old-style backstroke (four times back and forth). (8) The whole family—Zhunan and Hsiu-chiong in the center, Chang-hua on the right, and Hsiu-chen on the left—performed the crawl, breaststroke, side stroke, and backstroke. Following the audience's request, they repeated the performance once. Finally, little brother Chang-hua performed the "flower insertion" game from the top of the diving board three times. Each time, applause thundered and echoed outside the room.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Receptions. After the swimming performance ended at 4:15 PM, YMCA officials Yang Yihui and Lu Ganchen hosted tea and snacks. Reporters from the New Voice News Agency met Yang Zhunan in the room. According to him, today (the 5th), after breakfast at 10:30 AM, they will go to the Hardoon Garden. At noon, they will attend a luncheon at the Wuhu Railway Bureau, and at 5:00 PM in the evening, they will attend a dinner hosted by Pan Chengbo on Avenue Joffre and visit Yang Meinan's residence. Tomorrow (today), they will go to the Yanlu on Seymour Road in the morning and to Gaoqiao at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. In the evening, they will attend a banquet at the Gaoqiao Seaside Hotel. Xia Xiaoxia (first from the left) took a photo with the Yang Hsiu-chiong family after the banquet.</p>
<p>Xia's Mansion Banquet. Xia Xiaoxia, son of the martyr General Xia Zhiji of the Army, hosted a banquet at his residence at 27 Wanyi Lane, Rue Lupan yesterday afternoon to welcome the swimming champion Yang Hsiu-chiong. Mr. Xia sent a car to the New Asia Hotel at noon to pick up Yang's father Zhunan, mother Yang Long Huiming, sister Hsiu-chen, and brother Chang-hua. The guests and hosts chatted and laughed happily. At about 3:00 PM, they excused themselves to go to the YMCA for a performance.</p>
<p>Gaoqiao Performance. The Shanghai Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach, the Chinese Swimming Research Association, and the Three Wheels Lianhua Woolen Mill are jointly welcoming the mermaid Yang Hsiu-chiong at the seaside bathing beach today. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the Chinese Harmonica Association, in order to commend Ms. Yang for her contribution to the country at the Far Eastern Games, has specially selected 15 male and female harmonica players, led by the association's president Wang Qingdong, to perform various famous Chinese and Western melodies. Swimming time is from 3:00 PM to 6:30 PM. There will be small boats for protection. Those who wish to attend can take the ferry from the Bund Pier at 12:45 PM with their invitation. The City Ferry Administration has added eight ferries to travel between the Bund and Gaoqiao this afternoon to accommodate the large number of Shanghai citizens who are expected to attend. Round-trip tickets are priced at 2 yuan for special class, 1.2 yuan for first class, and 65 cents for second class (including the Gaoqiao bus). One-way tickets are half price.</p>
<p>Barnes et al.</p>
<h3>Cannot Come to China This Year</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, Central News Agency, 5th) The Beijing Amateur Athletic Association previously initiated an invitation to world-renowned tennis players Barnes et al. to perform in China. Recently, a telegram was received from Barnes et al. stating that due to unforeseen events, they will be unable to come to China this year, and the performance has been temporarily canceled.</p>

<h3>Motivation for Establishing the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association</h3>
<p>Since the National Government promulgated the Education Association Law on January 27, 1931, Jiangsu counties have been reorganizing county and district education associations in accordance with the law for more than three years, but have not established a provincial education association. Recently, education associations in Chongming, Jiading, Yancheng, Songjiang, Shanghai, and other counties have requested guarantees and maintenance for county education funds or have appealed for justice, but they have been suppressed and have been unable to obtain justice. Now, the Chongming and other county education associations have sent letters to all county education associations, and in accordance with the Education Association Law promulgated by the National Government, they have listed their opinions and sought the consent of all county education associations in order to establish the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education</p>
<h3>Explanation of Qualifications for Vocational Supplementary Classes</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to a report from the Qingpu County Education Bureau through the Jiangsu Education Department, stated that in order to implement productive education, the Xixi Elementary School in the county had attached a vocational supplementary class to recruit high school graduates to study for one year in order to take up employment. However, a few of these graduates, because they have no jobs, still intend to continue their studies. Their level is similar to that of the first year of junior high school. Can they be allowed to take the class transfer exam for the second year of junior high school? If the level is appropriate, can they be transferred to the first year? Also, do the graduation certificates of the graduates of the secondary class need to be verified by the Department? The Ministry of Education instructed the Department, "The curriculum of vocational supplementary classes attached to elementary schools focuses on vocational training and cannot be considered equivalent to the first year of junior high school. If these graduating students wish to continue their studies, they must take the entrance exam for the first year of junior high school and cannot take the class transfer exam for the second year of junior high school. At the end of the study period for students in these supplementary classes, the school should provide a certificate of academic performance and should not issue a graduation certificate."</p>

<p>Industrialist</p>
<h3>Jin Maofang Invests in Education</h3>
<p>Mr. Jin Maofang, a Ningbo industrialist, formerly resided in Japan. Seeing the country's clear political system and developed education, where parents of school-age children who do not attend school and receive education are penalized by the government, he made a grand aspiration. After returning to China, he first joined forces with industrial experts Xue Fuji, Wu Zhesheng, and others to establish the Great China Rubber Factory, producing rubber shoes. The achievements were remarkable and renowned both domestically and internationally. This year, Mr. Jin, in order to implement his initial aspirations for education and in memory of his late father, Mr. Deyuan, has once again devoted his remaining funds to the cause of education and talent cultivation. Considering the large number of children of workers and children out of school in the Xujiahui area, he has invested over ten thousand yuan to purchase more than eight mu of land on Jinyi Bridge Road in Xujiahui and build more than ten new-style school buildings and dormitories. He has established Deyuan Elementary School, offering tuition waivers and reductions to educate children out of school. The school's facilities, including classrooms, playgrounds, campuses, dormitories, and kindergartens and libraries, are very perfect and suitable for the latest scientific building methods. Yesterday, a reporter visited the school principal, who said that student registrations have reached more than 300, and teachers have also been hired, all of whom have experience in educating children. The teachers' benefits are excellent, with full-time on-campus positions that do not allow outside jobs. It is also heard that the school has followed the Education Bureau's procedures for establishing private elementary schools and is carrying out record-filing procedures and scheduled to hold an opening ceremony. At that time, all sectors will uniformly praise Mr. Jin's investment in education.</p>
<h3>New Atmosphere at Yuqing Middle School</h3>
<p>Yuqing Middle School, registered with the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, is located on Xiangyin Road in Jiangwan, with fresh air. Since the arrival of the new principal, Mr. Wang Hanliang, it has been reformed and renewed. Scholars in the field of education have been hired as teachers. In addition to strictly cultivating students' academic skills, attention is also paid to physical education, forging a comprehensive physical and mental development. It is heard that the registration for new students this semester has been very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Career Paths for Commercial Students at Zhengshi Middle School</h3>
<p>Zhengshi Middle School, founded by Mr. Du Yuesheng, has seen its first class of senior high school commercial students graduate this year. Except for Yu Sixiang and Zhang Suke, who went abroad to study science, and Zhu Chaoren, the top graduate whose further education or employment is yet to be determined, all the remaining graduates have been introduced to jobs in banks and companies in this city by Mr. Du.</p>

<h3>Should the Length of Study for Midwifery Schools be Standardized? (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>This explains that although the length of study may vary, the courses taught are all the same and cannot be changed separately.</p>
<p>Conversely, what if the courses offered vary with the length of study, and with the level of admission qualification? For example, the five-year course taught to high school graduates is not the same as the three-year course taught to junior high school graduates. The qualification level of high school graduates is much lower, and they cannot receive the same course as junior high school graduates; in addition to the three-year course taught to junior high school graduates, they must also take two years of basic courses similar to those in junior high school. For high school graduates, because of their higher level, the courses offered can of course be shortened. On the surface, this method seems reasonable: students with lower admission qualifications and lower levels are still given the opportunity to study midwifery, using supplementary methods to add some basic knowledge to the general midwifery course. In fact, this is still not a good method. First, since high school graduates need five years of study to learn midwifery, why don't they just go straight to junior high school and study, and then go to midwifery school after graduation? Because the difference in years is only one year; if they are determined to study midwifery, they will definitely not gamble on this short year. This kind of calculation is not very economical, and in some places, it feels like cutting the feet to fit the shoes. Secondly, although general midwifery schools, in order to accommodate the admission of high school graduates, specially add some basic academic subjects to the ordinary courses for students with lower admission qualifications to make up for their shortcomings. However, no matter how many academic subjects are added, they cannot be compared with ordinary middle schools, and they will never be as complete and well-organized. Moreover, it is highly questionable whether general midwifery schools can actually do this; because this kind of five-year midwifery school, in addition to the ordinary midwifery courses, also has to specially set up a class of remedial classes similar to the junior high school course; this is not suitable for general midwifery schools. The learners themselves do not receive any benefits or convenience, and the authorities running the midwifery schools not only increase a lot of trouble, but also may not be able to do it in practice, but the Ministry of Education resolutely stipulated it in the midwifery education system, and I feel that he has gone the wrong way! As a result, it will only disrupt the midwifery education system and will definitely not get the slightest benefit from it.</p>
<p>Regarding the length of study of midwifery schools, the Ministry of Education seemed to have previously stipulated that it was two years. The admission qualification also seemed to only stipulate junior high school graduation. This time, the length of study for junior high school graduates has been increased by one year; at the same time, a special education system has been added for high school graduates who need five years of study. I do not express any objection to the issue of increasing the length of study, just as the Ministry of Education recently instructed all medical schools in the country to add one year of internship to the end of the course of study before formally graduating and performing the duties of a doctor, which is a legitimate method. So-called midwifery and childbirth are matters of life, and should be taken seriously. We only sympathize with increasing the length of study and raising the level of students, and there is no reason to object. However, raising the level and increasing the length of study should also have a unified method. All midwifery schools with the same name, the same nature, and the same purpose, whether they are government-run or private, should be the same throughout the country and should not differ from each other. It is certainly wrong to specially lower the admission qualification to extend the length of study: it is also inappropriate to specially raise the admission qualification to shorten the length of study. Only by ensuring that the admission qualification at the time of application should be the same, regardless of whether the organizer is official or private, and the length of study after admission should also be the same, is this the right method, so as to unify the education system and benefit China's midwifery education.

<h3>Eczema, One of the Common Skin Diseases in Hot Weather (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ji Jilin</p>
<p>The sultry heat steams people. Sweat pours like rain. The skin is easily infiltrated and stimulated by sweat, and the most likely to develop stubborn and difficult-to-treat eczema. Those who suffer from it often regard it as a minor illness that is not harmful. They often buy Shalaier and other disinfectant drugs or other drugs to apply for treatment. However, due to inaccurate diagnosis or improper drug concentration, the disease spreads and becomes difficult to treat. Recently, several old friends have asked me for treatment because they have backfired. A spark can start a prairie fire. Be careful in everything, not only in treating diseases.</p>
<p>Eczema is one of the inflammatory skin diseases. What is called inflammation in medicine has five main signs: burning, redness, swelling, pain, and functional impairment. Regardless of the disease, as long as it has one or all of the above five main signs, it is called inflammation. When eczema is mild, it only has one or two of them, but during the acute symptoms, it mostly has the above five main signs. Although functional impairment is relatively rare, if eczema occurs in the flexion of the joints, it can also cause abnormal movement. What makes patients even more unbearable is that eczema is always abnormally itchy, regardless of its severity. It is even worse when it is heated or sweating, which makes it impossible to sleep peacefully at night. If it causes neurasthenia, it will affect nutrition. Therefore, although eczema is a minor illness, it will not endanger life. However, to seek appropriate treatment, it is not effective without a specialist in dermatology.</p>
<p>The causes of eczema are divided into two types: internal and external. Internal causes are generally more likely to occur in patients with glandular diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, neurological diseases, menstrual diseases, diabetes, kidney diseases, liver diseases, anemia, and weakness. Therefore, when the above patients also suffer from eczema, attention should be paid to the cause when treating it. If it is anemia and weakness, it is necessary to replenish blood and strengthen the body. If only the eczema is treated, abandoning the root and chasing the branches, although it is cured, it will eventually recur. Among the external causes, it can be divided into four types.</p>
<p>(1) Chemical stimulation. Drugs with severe stimulation, such as sulfur mercury and other ointments, often cause eczema when applied to the skin for a long time. Secondly, those who work in factories that manufacture stimulating drugs can also develop eczema because their skin is often stimulated by drugs. This kind of eczema is called occupational eczema.</p>
<p>(2) Thermal stimulation. In hot weather, the skin is exposed to the sun, or firemen, ironworkers, etc. often come into contact with fire, and eczema often occurs. However, in the cold winter, the skin is stimulated by severe cold, and the same can happen.</p>
<p>(3) Mechanical stimulation. It is relatively rare for eczema to be caused solely by mechanical stimulation. If there is any, it must be combined with chemical or thermal stimulation. For example, during summer travel, friction between the thighs causes eczema due to sweating. In winter, although walking long distances, no eczema occurs because there is no sweating.</p>
<p>(4) Invasion of bacteria. Although someone has found golden Staphylococcus aureus in the scales, exudates, and deep epithelial cells of eczema, it is known that this bacterium can never cause eczema alone. Therefore, the bacterial theory is still under continuous research and has not been determined.</p>
<p>A brief description of eczema symptoms: To explain the symptoms of eczema, it is necessary to first know the course of its development. From the occurrence of eczema to its complete cure, it is divided into six stages according to its state of discovery:</p>
<p>1. Erythema stage (erythematous eczema): The skin is red and slightly swollen.</p>
<p>2. Papule stage (papular eczema): Pimples the size of pinheads appear on the skin, and there is a feeling of itching.</p>
<p>3. Vesicle stage (vesicular eczema): There is liquid retention under the stratum corneum of the skin, turning into vesicles. The content is transparent.</p>
<p>4. Pustule stage (pustular eczema): The content of the vesicles becomes pus.</p>
<p>5. Wet stage or scab stage (wet eczema or scab eczema): Vesicles or pustules rupture and flow out due to external stimulation (such as friction of clothes or scratching) or the filling of the content. Therefore, the skin is moist, and the liquid that flows out dries and forms scabs.</p>
<p>6. Scale stage (scaly eczema): After the scabs fall off, the stratum corneum of the rash surface often has scaly flaking due to the vigorous metabolism. When the flaking disappears, the eczema is completely cured.</p>

<p>(A) What is a tonsil? The original name of tonsil is Tonsille. It is generally called Rǔ'é (乳蛾, meaning "breast moth") in common parlance. It is also called Hóu'é (喉蛾, meaning "throat moth"). The national doctors of our country also use these two names. The reason for calling it tonsil in medicine is because of its shape, which resembles a peach. Therefore, it is called tonsil. And because its tissue is a special adenoid tissue existing in the lamina propria of the mucous membrane, it is called gland. Therefore, it is collectively called tonsil.</p>
<p>(B) Where is it located? Tonsils are generally divided into three types, namely (1) palatine tonsils, (2) lingual tonsils, and (3) pharyngeal tonsils. There are also granules or follicles growing on the posterior wall of the pharynx, which can also belong to the tonsils. Therefore, there is also a (4) Waldeyer's tonsillar ring. I will now separately explain the location of these types of tonsils.</p>
<p>(1) Palatine tonsils = originally named TonsillapaＩalinae or Gauneutonsille. On the left and right sides of the oral cavity, there are two mucous membrane folds arranged one in front of the other. The one located in the front is called the anterior palatine arch. The one located in the back is called the posterior palatine arch. The meeting point of the left and right palatine arches is the uvula (commonly called the "little tongue"). The middle of the two palatine arches (near the tongue) is a fossa formed by a depression. This fossa is called the tonsillar fossa. The palatine tonsils occupy this fossa. The left and right are the same. Generally, people call it Rǔ'é or Hóu'é, which refer to these two palatine tonsils. I will now draw a sketch so that you can understand it better.</p>
<p>(1) Upper lip</p>
<p>(2) Lower lip</p>
<p>(3) Tongue</p>
<p>(4) Soft palate</p>
<p>(5) Uvula</p>
<p>(6) Anterior palatine arch</p>
<p>(7) Posterior palatine arch</p>
<p>(8) Palatine tonsil</p>
<p>(9) Posterior wall of the pharynx</p>
<p>(2) Lingual tonsils = originally named Tonsillalingnal, or Zungeutonsille. In the root of the tongue.</p>
<p>(3) Pharyngeal tonsils = originally named Tonsillapharyugea, or Racheutonsille. In the nasopharynx. Therefore, it is also called the nasopharyngeal tonsil.</p>
<p>(C) What is his physiological state like? When the spring season starts, the tonsils will atrophy due to physiological regression and degeneration. However, when inflammation occurs frequently or when hypertrophy occurs, there will be no physiological atrophy.</p>
<p>(D) What are his pathological changes like? The pathological changes of the tonsils refer to inflammation and hypertrophy. Clinically, children are more likely to suffer from hypertrophy than adults. Adults are more likely to suffer from inflammation than children. I will talk about all the detailed conditions next time.</p>
<p>(Errata) In the last issue's symptoms of a cold, "thin watery serous" was mistakenly printed as "thin woody serous."</p>
<p>In the treatment methods, "lemon sweat" was mistakenly printed as "lemon sweat" and "hot water foot bath" was mistakenly printed as "sweat water foot bath."</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (15)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Caseous pneumonia mostly occurs in the alveoli; this area is filled with exudate and fibrin alveolar epithelium, which is similar to ordinary true pneumonia. As a result, this exudate is gradually absorbed, presenting a caseous state. The scope of his lesions is not fixed in size; some are limited to local areas, and some are diffusely enlarged to the entire lobe of the lung, and can even invade the position of two or three lobes. The local area extends from a glandular vesicle to the size of a lobule of the lung, which is the type of bronchopneumonia mentioned above. Therefore, caseous pneumonia and bronchopneumonia have no fundamental differences in nature; it is just that the degree of disease spread and the size of the lesions are different! This disease is very serious in clinical terms, and it almost always leads to death in a few months. His disease course can be divided into two periods: the first is the gelatinous transparent period, which lasts about two weeks; the second is the caseous degeneration period, which lasts almost a month or a month and a half. Finally, of course, it can tend to soften and cause cavities; it can also cause calcareous sclerosis, allowing the patient to prolong life for several years, but this is ultimately the minority.</p>
<p>The above has roughly described representative examples of proliferative and exudative pulmonary tuberculosis, disseminated miliary tuberculosis, and caseous pneumonia! But we must know that in fact, pulmonary tuberculosis is not completely fixed on one side, but is a mixture of two types: except for microscopic work, which can distinguish whether a certain part belongs to proliferative or exudative lesions, in clinical terms, it is sometimes impossible to distinguish clearly. Even the changes in the three stages of general tuberculous caseous degeneration and cavitation, we should also know that in each patient, some lesions have already found cavities, and some are still in caseous degenerated tuberculosis or calcareous sclerosis. There are many examples of this! It is not that if cavities are found, the changes in other lesions are all uniform. I think readers should not ignore this fact.</p>
<h3>Each Person's Own Piece of Sky (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yiqing</p>
<p>It's inevitably a bit chaotic inside the theater!</p>
<p>Going to the theater to watch entertainment, whether it's opera, drama, film, or listening to music, isn't true rest, true "relaxation." Moreover, it's all passive entertainment, not active amusement, mostly indoors, not outdoors. The only solace is that one can always find joy for the eyes and ears, shifting the focus of attention, and mentally balancing leisure activities with proper work. When encountering a stage performance with boisterous jokes, one can even smile broadly and laugh heartily. Therefore, regardless of whether one can appreciate art, just joining in the excitement, seeing the variety, and experiencing some low-brow fun is more than enough and not necessarily wrong. This doesn't require resorting to the hackneyed saying "Life is for enjoyment," nor does it require standing in the shoes of the so-called "leisure class." Presumably, everyone feels the same way (the national crisis is not over, and many patriots may advocate for a long-term suspension of entertainment, but that is not relevant to this topic).</p>
<p>Since watching entertainment is beneficial for mental adjustment (sometimes the lateness of the hour or the excessive stimulation can lead to insomnia, or the inferior quality of the material can unconsciously subject one to adverse influences, which is a separate matter), how can it also cause health problems? This is where complications arise. The easiest to see, and what everyone often complains about, are the physical phenomena. For example, in movie theaters, ventilation equipment is often inadequate, and by the middle of the show, during intermissions or before, the air often feels foul, "reeking of killing intent," and quite unbearable, especially during daytime showings (because the windows also have to be closed during the day). In theaters, in addition to the similar situations mentioned above, the poor management of the floor often leads to dust swirling, with the "earthy fragrance" (?) assaulting the nostrils, much like being hit by some kind of military poisonous gas, causing sneezing. These are all examples. As for biological phenomena, for example, in general, theatergoers often hastily purchase watered-down or openly sold fruits, openly sold or stale cooked food to quench their thirst or satisfy their hunger, becoming infected with some kind of dirty germs (present in all seasons, especially in summer), or perhaps enjoying the preferential treatment of the tea servers and ticket takers, using a squeezed-out face towel to wipe their faces and hands, and drinking tea from a cracked bowl, contracting trachoma virus, gonorrhea, syphilis spirochetes, various skin disease germs, or diphtheria bacilli from the face towel or teacup (this is also regardless of the season; but upper-class guests in boxes and stalls are especially prone to this). These are all examples.</p>
<p>Too much carbon dioxide in the room, "gas prices too high" ||| too little oxygen: according to the general rule of valuing things that are scarce, it's therefore said to be too expensive |||, its harmful effects are now known to be not as serious as previously stated ||| because the temperature, humidity, and air circulation, which should also be noted at the same time, also occupy important positions. Even if symptoms of congestion and poisoning develop at the time, one will still recover after leaving and breathing in fresh air again. Although dust particles are small, they often have extremely sharp edges, and inhaling them into the respiratory tract easily damages the mucous membranes, effectively opening the door for respiratory infectious disease germs to penetrate into tissues, which is often overlooked. Sometimes the dust also carries some "lively and jumpy" germs ||| transmitted from the sputum, saliva, or droplets of patients or infected individuals |||, which are then inhaled along with the dust. However, this may require accumulation over time to see the bad results. Telling this to people who only care about immediate comfort may be like "a long night's dream," and difficult to explain. Furthermore, those with a little common sense may already "disobey the emperor's orders" and resolutely refuse the tea server's squeezed-out face towel and cracked tea bowl, or go a step further and carefully select and avoid being "fooled" by all the food sold in the venue. However, the biggest problem, the most urgent situation, the least noticed by us, and the most difficult to prevent spreading "factor" is the droplets exhaled or sprayed by the crowd in the venue (easiest to see in cold weather, commonly called "cold air" or "breath"). The venue is filled with air containing everyone's exhaled droplets. Is this what theatergoers are supposed to enjoy?</p>

<h3>Creation and Cultivation</h3>
<p>— Dongsheng</p>
<p>The formation of everything in the world is never a one-time accidental event. The more brilliant and magnificent it is, the more arduous the effort invested in its creation must be compared to those that are superficial and lack depth. Isn't the reason why the Egyptian pyramids have been passed down to the present because of the infinite intellect and blood and sweat of the designers and builders of that time interwoven within them? To put it more simply, in the difficult-to-trace ancient past, huge pieces of wood were buried in the strata, subjected to the sudden attacks of hot and cold, and then subjected to external pressure, solidifying into stones. After countless years, like fleeting time, from stone to coal, from coal to smokeless coal, through friction, tempering, cascading, and erosion, it finally becomes a brilliant diamond. People must not pay attention to these long accumulation of time in a moment of praise, right?</p>
<p>Great literary works, like brilliant diamonds, must also undergo a long period of gestation before they can be born into the world. Just like a woman giving birth to a child, there must be ten months of pregnancy and painful childbirth. Those that are congenitally deficient will inevitably die prematurely. Tolstoy spent seven years writing War and Peace, which eventually became a masterpiece praised for centuries. Prolific writer Dawson, although he wrote quickly, none of his works can be said to have permanent value.</p>
<p>This raises the question of creation and cultivation. Cultivation, so-called, means subtle comprehension, which can also be said to be profound imagination. When a train of thought comes, one should not immediately move and pick up a pen to express it in writing. One must slowly chew it over, slowly ponder it, and organize the train of thought to make it more real. Once written down, there will not be much to criticize, and everything will leave the reader with an impression that is not a fleeting moment of emotion but a permanent memory.</p>
<p>Experiencing, deeply experiencing everything encountered, is a condition for making creation great. Being able to comprehend subtly allows one to create truth from fantasy, see meaning from facts, see profoundness from the ordinary, and see completeness from the trivial. Being able to comprehend subtly will give rise to rich and beautiful imagination, weaving a supernatural literary talent in one's heart.</p>
<p>Upon seeing something and thinking of something, the desire for creation arises. In the effort of creation, one always hopes to express the imagination, to translate the complete emotions into words with traces. This hope is not easy to achieve. Perhaps no writer has ever been able to fully achieve it. The reason is probably due to the lack of deep cultivation. When the heart is completely open and the power of expression has reached a state of saturation, then one can begin to write. Writing it down will at least be easier than picking up a pen and writing immediately to achieve the attempt to fully translate the imagination into words!</p>
<p>Not only that, but what is written on paper as soon as one picks up a pen is nothing more than facts, ordinariness, and triviality. What else is there besides these? But after this layer of cultivation, it is different. Having been deeply tasted by the author, and then organized very appropriately everywhere using this exquisite technique, it teaches the reader not only to see these, but also to touch everything that the author has tasted deeply beyond these. Therefore, a kind of appreciative joy arises as a result, and the success of the creation is achieved.</p>
<p>In today's extravagant literary world, fresh and good literature will not be produced, because the element of cultivation in creation is too shallow. It can also be said that the author does not even have a deep understanding of his own works, so how can he arouse the reader's resonance!</p>
<h3>I Came from the East (15)</h3>
<p>— Hoshino</p>
<p>I feel that our country has ruined them. | | Why can't China have something like the Nippon Yusen Kaisha? Why can't China use these young people to build a strong Pacific fleet for the country?</p>
<p>The Chinese crew members on the ship had a considerable organization after the September 18th Incident. Their patriotic enthusiasm is very admirable. They restrained themselves, and whenever the ship passed Japan, they were not allowed to land. In terms of sentiment, it meant not setting foot on the land of the enemy; in terms of reason, landing on Japanese soil meant at least taking Japanese trains, spending money to buy Japanese goods, and eating Japanese food, which would be destroying China's boycott movement and encouraging the Japanese. They enforced this resolution very strictly before, forcing the crew and advising passengers (Chinese). If the advice was not followed, they could only use honor to sanction them. However, in the past year, this movement has gradually passed. Some on the ship who are extremely patriotic still restrain themselves, while those who are less disciplined go ashore in Yokohama and Kobe to seek base pleasures.</p>
<p>Before we arrived in Yokohama, we all discussed it with each other. The Hong Kong sisters advocated not going, but I really wanted to see it, because those of us who study international issues need to personally observe the source of this world conflict to satisfy our desires. What's more, I had planned to spend a few months in Tokyo to study in detail the Japanese people and society in the interwar period. When the ship stopped at Yokohama port, Japanese customs officers came on board. The tea server took our passports, saying that the passports had been stamped by the Japanese authorities when we traveled from Shanghai to the Americas three years ago, so there was no problem with going ashore and boarding the ship. Later I discovered that Japanese customs did not interrogate or inspect passengers without luggage at all. This is Japan's way of attracting tourists. The Chinese government charges Americans an entry fee, so money-loving Americans say that the Japanese government is more polite than the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>Setting Sun</h3>
<p>— Liu Shijun</p>
<p>At that time, a round red sun, as if tired of this world full of autumn colors, was slowly sinking towards the boundless sky and sea; the white clouds, like fish scales, bathed in the blood-red, surging west sky, completely disappearing the dimness and gloom, and illusioning dazzling colors of red, yellow and purple. The returning crows in flocks, croaking hoarsely, seemed to have a special expression, not knowing whether they were mourning the setting of the sun or marveling at the splendor of the west sky?</p>
<p>Time passed moment by moment, and the wheel of the setting sun also spun incessantly, finally gradually sinking westward. Half of the dazzling scale clouds turned into suffocating cloud skeletons, and the other half turned into flowing rosy clouds and scattered leisurely. The croaking of the returning crows became more and more urgent, as if it were the elegy of the world. I thought, I don't know how many people mourn for this setting sun with a fiery ambition? And I don't know how many people curse the coming of dusk, the guide of the night? But, in mourning and cursing, what is coming will inevitably come, and what is going will never be able to not go. The setting sun, seemingly tired of the world, finally unhesitatingly and without nostalgia gave the entire world to dusk.</p>
<p>Dusk ruled the world in silence.</p>
<p>The red sun had set, and night had not yet come. I returned alone with many indescribable feelings, and the childhood memories, like a vanished remnant dream, suddenly floated to my mind. At that time, I was probably seven or eight years old, I can't remember clearly, because my mother cherished me too much, she didn't allow me to go to the fields alone to play idly, especially at dusk. As for me, although I wanted to listen to my mother, I sometimes couldn't resist the lure of my companions, my body stood still, but my eyes shot out light of envy and conjecture. My mother saw this mood, and couldn't bear to go against my wishes too much, but she was still worried, so she had to accompany me. I remember that at that time she told me that when the sun sets, if black clouds rise in the west, called "dark clouds receiving the sun," the weather tomorrow will definitely be bad; she also told me that if the horizon burns red at sunset, the stars will definitely be shining at night; she also told me that at sunset, some bad things will come out. I asked her what they were, and she seemed afraid of hurting my childlike heart, and always refused to say, only repeatedly telling me that those bad things can't give us anything good, and they only appear at sunset. She didn't seem to have thought at that time that her son would also have times when he watched the sunset alone. My mother must have told me these words countless times, and they were deeply engraved in my childhood heart: therefore, although today I am watching the sunset alone in a foreign land, it seems like I am still standing next to my mother, and the past events that have disappeared for many years suddenly float to my mind.</p>
<p>In silence, night has not yet come, and dusk is still ruling our world.</p>

<h3>Youth Employment Problems</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>Do young people really have a way out? This question, at first glance, seems quite difficult to answer. Because from a theoretical point of view, this can involve major problems such as social ills, landlord exploitation, and the collapse of the rural economy. If we expand on it further, this can also be extended to serious topics such as the economic aggression of the great powers, the world's recession, and the decline of imperialists. However, abandoning theory and talking about facts, I feel that the problem of youth's way out is not as serious as the above. Whether they really have a way out, the key lies entirely in the youth themselves: in other words, it is entirely up to their ability to be self-aware. Now I will narrate a few things I know and have heard in detail as follows:</p>
<p>In a certain metropolis, there is a normal school, and this year's summer vacation has already seen the graduation of third-grade students. Counting forty people per grade, after the summer, there will be one hundred and twenty young people squeezing into the social network. When they were about to graduate, in addition to preparing for lessons and fearing that the final exam would not pass, they were also worried about their way out after graduation. They secretly asked people for help, and even the school authorities sent letters everywhere, doing their best to recommend this generation of future reformers to various local education bureaus or elementary schools. Their ideal standards were: location, must be a metropolis; time, at most 900 minutes of teaching per week; compensation, 30 yuan per month.</p>
<p>A teacher, harboring good intentions, introduced youth A to serve in an elementary school in a certain place; that youth agreed and had already agreed, but in the end he returned the letter of appointment. When asked the reason, the compensation was only four yuan short of the ideal standard. Youth B, because he had to take on 1,200 minutes of lessons per week, had no way to refuse, so he had to say that his body couldn't take it and was willing to turn the matter down. Youth C, the elementary school of his alma mater wanted to ask him to go back to serve. He also initially said yes and no because the compensation did not meet the standard, and then ran into walls everywhere, so he had to beg the principal of his alma mater to arrange a position. Youth D claimed that an elementary school in his hometown wanted to call him to go, but because the location was remote, he was ultimately unwilling to go. Youth E was good at music. He was used to playing the piano in his alma mater, so he declared to others that if there was no piano in the elementary school, he would not be willing to condescend. There was also youth F, a certain elementary school asked someone to contact him, with a monthly compensation of 22 yuan. That youth immediately said to the person who came, "This is really a joke," which made the person who came feel bored and leave.</p>
<p>The above are all real examples. In addition, there are youths G, H, I, J, etc., who always sit at home and wait quietly for opportunities. Not knowing that time is ruthless, they only know how to wait, wait, wait. As a result: the end of July, the staff of each elementary school are almost all settled, and countless wanderers are added to the city, still dreaming of gold.</p>
<p>Whether young people really have a way out, the ironclad facts have told us that it is like this. Like the few youths mentioned above, they clearly have a road ahead that they can take, but they refuse to take it; then, for the sake of treating the symptoms, what use is it for us to talk highly about "the large number of unemployed young people today is due to the mistakes in education policy in the past few decades and the very weak relationship between the content of secondary education and social life and people's livelihood" (see the news about the problem of unemployment relief for college students in this newspaper on August 2nd)? When young people are studying, they often like to talk about fashionable topics such as "hard work," "silent work," "going to the people," and "transforming the countryside," but as soon as they are really asked to do this, their words do not match their hearts. They only think about material comfort or the amount of compensation in their hearts: their eyes are full of the red and green colors of the city and all kinds of temptations. They are not even aware of this morbid state. What can others do?</p>
<p>Normal school students are like this. By analogy, other students are also like this? Junior and senior high school graduates want to be postal workers, compradors of foreign companies, bank directors, and what section chiefs and specialists. University graduates then want to be an official. No wonder the number of unemployed people in society who cannot carry on their shoulders or lift with their hands is increasing day by day. So do young people really have a way out? This question, I dare to prove with facts that they cannot say that they have no way out, but they have gone in the wrong direction.

<h3>Under the Signs of Disaster</h3>
<p>— Lian Zhen</p>
<p>Li Sanniang's two feet only cared about spinning on the waterwheel, but her heart was just planning this and that.</p>
<p>The crescent moon had already peeked out from under the horizon, and the scorching heat, like flames, seemed to have disappeared for the most part. At this time, a cool breeze was blowing gently. Li Sanniang, still unwilling to let go of the only good opportunity of this day, despite her husband being seriously ill at home, still mustered her last remaining courage under this faint moonlight, spinning the wheel of the waterwheel with her two feet. Spinning. Spinning.</p>
<p>The silence of the night gradually expanded. Li Sanniang's heart was becoming more and more chaotic. Thinking that her husband was really pitiful enough, seeing the water in the fields drying up little by little. That was no different from the crystallization of the blood and flesh of the whole family | | that rice seedling. Withers day by day. For half a month, the two of them had been treading on the waterwheel day and night, but what was the use? What's the use? The fields were still cracking more and more severely day by day. The poor husband finally fell ill under the dual attacks of anxiety and fatigue. At this time, Li Sanniang's feet treading on the waterwheel became slow.</p>
<p>She also remembered the past at this time, under this faint moonlight, there were two shadows side by side, and there was also a trace of a child. Many encouraging words often flowed from the man's mouth, and Li Sanniang had never felt overly tired. If she really felt a little tired sometimes, the man would say in a singing, gentle tone: "Sanniangzi, you rest, let me do it alone." So Li Sanniangzi sometimes really jumped off the waterwheel, and the man would move the wheel of the waterwheel even harder, but never exceeding ten minutes, Li Sanniang would jump back up, and her two feet would be moving like flying again. Li Sanniang thought of this, and couldn't help but shed a few tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>She also thought: at this time, her husband was suffering in pain, not knowing how. Her husband hadn't swallowed a grain of rice for four or five days. Moreover, today's illness was even more strange, and he didn't even want to drink water. Although everyone said that Old Man Chen's prescription was very effective, it cost three yuan every time. And also add half a dollar more for medicine. The family had already pawned everything away. The medical expenses for the past few days were all from Xiao Linger's… Li Sanniang couldn't think anymore, she simply prostrated herself on the waterwheel frame, her two feet still, and sobbed.</p>
<p>Ah! Poor Xiao Linger, from birth to now, she has never had a comfortable day. When she was a child, both parents had to work in the fields, and sometimes she was left in the corner of the house like a stray dog, and sometimes she was exposed to the wild fields like a watermelon in summer. Gradually able to run and jump, when winter came, she had to dip her bare little feet into the frozen river to touch the aquatic products, and also rush to the market early to sell them.</p>

<h3>This Year's Silk Industry and Its Future</h3>
<p>— Di'an</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The spring cocoon market in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has largely come to an end. The results of the silkworm farmers' season of hard work, whether profit or loss, not only affect the lives of individual farming families, but also, because Jiangsu and Zhejiang are famous silk-producing areas in China, with most farmers mainly engaged in silkworm rearing, the abundance or scarcity of silkworm harvests has a decisive impact on the entire rural economy, and the price of cocoons is even more closely related to the lives of farmers. In recent years, the decline of the silk industry has been like a river rushing rapidly downhill. Overseas markets have been controlled by Japan, and domestic sales channels have become increasingly narrow due to the collapse of the national economy. The difficulty of developing the silk industry has become a widely recognized fact. Today's cocoon situation, according to what is scattered in the newspapers, cannot be said to be anything but a bumper harvest, but cocoon prices are not high, sales are blocked, and silkworm farmers are losing money everywhere. Year after year, it is about to be seen that silkworm farmers will be unable to move forward, forming an unprecedented decline in the silk industry. Here is a general observation of the cocoon market situation and silk sales, which may also be of interest to those concerned about the silk industry?</p>
<p>This year's silkworm harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is generally good. Although at the beginning of the silkworm season, due to irregular weather and abnormal cold, many of those who raised native silkworms early found diseased silkworms, and many were discarded at the second instar. Afterwards, the weather gradually warmed, and the temperature was suitable, so the progress was very good. Late-batch native silkworms also had an eighty percent yield, although slightly worse than last year, but compared with the early-batch, which had only a thirty percent yield, there was a world of difference. As for silkworms raised from improved varieties, because there is no great relationship with good or bad weather, there is a one hundred percent harvest. Taking the silkworm areas of Zhejiang Province as an example, this year the Department of Construction distributed 600,000 sheets of improved varieties, each sheet producing cocoons ranging from a maximum of 50 jin to a minimum of 20 jin, with an average total output of 18 million dan of cocoons, and the cocoon quality is also very good. The situation of those raising improved varieties in Jiangsu Province is also the same.</p>
<p>A good silkworm season is originally the most comforting thing for silkworm farmers, but the low price of cocoons has also set a new record in recent years, so the gains do not compensate for the losses.</p>
<p>The highest price for high-quality cocoons of improved varieties is no more than 35 yuan, and the lowest is only 20 yuan, which is a huge drop compared with the highest of 44 yuan and the lowest of 25 yuan last year; if we talk about native cocoons - most farmers raise native cocoons - the highest is no more than 20 yuan, and the lowest is only 12 yuan, which is like a world away compared with the highest of 90 yuan in the Republic of China in 14 years and 33 yuan last year. Although the price of cocoons is so low, the price of mulberry leaves has not fallen much. In Zhejiang, although the number of silkworm farmers has decreased and the leaf production is abundant, there is a surplus of supply over demand, and there are occasional drops to 3 jiao per dan, but this is a special phenomenon. The general average is always around 1.5 yuan per dan, and some are as high as 2 yuan or more. If each dan of cocoons consumes 15 dan of mulberry leaves, then those who raise improved varieties will not completely lose money, but there is no profit to be made. As for silkworm farmers who raise native silkworms, not only is there no profit, but they also have to lose nearly 10 yuan per dan. In Jiangsu, silkworm farmers suffer from a shortage of mulberry leaves and soaring leaf prices, with each dan of mulberry leaves costing 3.3 or 3.4 yuan, so the cost of fresh cocoons and leaves is more than 50 yuan per 100 jin, which is more than 10 yuan different from the highest price of 35 yuan in the cocoon market, not to mention native silkworm cocoons. The losses of silkworm farmers this year can be seen from this; a season of hard work not only fails to obtain a reasonable price for labor, but also loses money, and the impact is deep and heavy, which is self-evident!</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Needless to say, the reason why cocoon prices have fallen so much is due to the sluggish silk market and blocked sales channels. Domestic silk factories have been losing money for years and cannot maintain operations, and closures and bankruptcies are often heard: in Shanghai alone, there were originally as many as 108 silk factories, but before the new cocoons were on the market, only five or six were barely continuing to operate. Although it is now the spring cocoon season, only more than 20 factories in Zhabei Jiyu, Yutong, Chuxin, Yuanji and other places have resumed operations. The Baotai Four Factories in Nanshi and the area around Caojiadu have not yet opened. Only six or seven silk factories have started operations in Zhejiang, and all are temporary, and will be closed after the silk and silkworm season. On the other hand, the European and American silk cocoon markets are still extremely depressed. Last year, in May and June, the highest Shanghai factory silk in the European and American markets could be sold for more than 900 yuan per dan, but in the second half of the year, it gradually fell, with each dan falling by 200 to 300 yuan; this spring, there was no improvement, and each dan fell to 500 yuan. Recently, the highest Shanghai factory silk in the European and American markets opened at more than 450 yuan per dan, and the future is still bleak. If each dan of silk requires an average of 13 dan of fresh cocoons or 4.5 dan of dry cocoons, the cost is 500 yuan, even if all other expenses are not counted, each dan must lose dozens of yuan. Since silk prices have fallen so much, the lack of outlets for new cocoons and the sharp drop in cocoon prices can be said to be an inevitable trend that cannot be improved.</p>
<p>However, in China, in addition to the oppression caused by this world panic and the dumping of Japanese silk, there seem to be other shackles weighing on the shoulders of silkworm farmers. This is the unexpected burden and price suppression policy resulting from the control of the silk industry. It is said that the government authorities are using great efforts to improve China's silk industry. The Executive Yuan has drafted special regulations for improving the silk industry, and international experts on "technical cooperation" are also working to improve China's silk industry. However, regardless of this, the actual situation is often to exploit silkworm farmers, so that silkworm farmers not only cannot get the benefits of the authorities' improvement, but also suffer unexpected burdens. This can be clearly seen in the issue of the Wuxi Cocoon Industry Association and the Jiangyin Cocoon Industry Association opposing the Jiangsu Province's silk industry control bill this year.</p>
<p>Here, there are two aspects to the problem. The first is the restriction of cocoon firms, and the second is the collection of improvement fees, etc. According to the opinion of the Wuxi Cocoon Industry Association, "Articles 4, 123 of the Cocoon Firm Control Regulations stipulate that there are words such as registration, verification, and lottery. In name, it is control, but in reality, it is restriction. Not only does it exploit the cocoon firm owners' freedom to pay posts and open businesses, but it also causes silkworm farmers to suffer from low prices due to the squeeze of few people, widespread selling roads, and steamed damage. The insufficiency of restriction is compounded by economic oppression, such as Article 6 stipulating that cocoon collectors must register in advance and pay a deposit of 3 yuan per dan of dry cocoons, and Article 8 stipulating that each factory and merchant that collects dry cocoons has an obligation to voluntarily acknowledge the cocoon camphor price and the improvement of silkworm and mulberry business fee of 12 yuan. This kind of disguised donation is even worse than the previous likin tax, harming merchants and people, what is worse than this."</p>
<p>"Different people have different opinions." The authorities, who take it upon themselves to improve the silk industry, stated that "cocoon firm control is one of the entire measures to save the silk industry in this province. China's silk industry has reached the most dangerous degree. If improvements are not urgently sought, it will suffer great international competition and fall into bankruptcy. The livelihoods of farmers and the status of merchants will be fundamentally affected. Therefore, no matter what, there will be no changes. Moreover, the provincial government and the central government have the same views. As for the collection of improvement fees, Zhejiang Province has already implemented it last fall, and this year it has levied it again with precedent. Moreover, the use of improving the silk industry is different from donations and taxes. If there are a few people who do not understand the truth and disregard the future interests of farmers, and deliberately obstruct the progress of the business, they will be severely punished" (May 31st, Da Wan Bao).</p>
<p>In this way, the government has taken the protection of "the future interests of farmers" as a sacred responsibility, and farmers should be grateful. However, it is a pity that the farmers do not know how to be grateful and voluntarily give up "future interests." For example, "There were originally 27 old-style cocoon firms in Jintan County. Since the implementation of control this year, all of them have been abolished. Instead, silk magnates such as Xue Shouxuan from Wuxi have jointly invested with old cocoon merchants in the county to build four new-style cocoon firms, with very complete equipment. Now that the cocoon collection has begun, because there are few cocoon firms, the cocoon price can be limited. The highest price is only 25 or 26 yuan. The villagers clashed because it was not enough to cover the cost, and all four firms were destroyed. The Jintan County government has telegraphed the province to send security forces to Jintan to suppress the situation, and the storm is still difficult to quell" (June 7th, Shen Bao). What about the farmers in other places? Because they were unwilling to receive the "benefit of cocoon prices not being high due to control," they "baked and reeled themselves." They were silent, but resentful in their hearts.</p>
<p>As for who is the actual bearer of the burden of collecting improvement fees? As the saying goes, "the wool comes from the sheep," doesn't it ultimately fall on the farmers? Merchants are also very frank about this, saying: "Article 8 of the measures states that all approved cocoon merchants have an obligation to acknowledge the improved cocoon variety price and the improvement of silkworm and mulberry fee of 12 yuan per dan of dry cocoons. At this time, the overseas silk market has plummeted, and the rural economy is on the verge of collapse. Eight or nine out of ten manufacturers are bankrupt. Even if they are not required to bear this obligation, many are still hesitant to move forward. If they are forced to donate again, they will be even more afraid of the harshness of the government. Moreover, this increased burden, although nominally taken from merchants, is actually taken from farmers. The future of the cocoon industry is increasingly falling into a state of irretrievable ruin" (see Jiangyin Cocoon Industry Association's telegram, June 5th, Da Wan Bao).</p>
<p>Under the triple burden of the world panic in the silk industry, the dumping of Japanese silk, and domestic donations, the shoulders of Chinese silkworm farmers are so weighed down that they cannot stand up straight. They have a great "concept of being disgusted with silkworm rearing, and planting rice instead of mulberry trees, one-third of them." But what if they don't raise silkworms? How can farmers who grow other agricultural products not think the same way?</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Finally, let me briefly examine the future of China's silk industry. If I state the conclusion first, it will not be difficult for people to assert: the golden age of China's silk industry has long passed. If no extraordinary event occurs (such as the great earthquake in Japan in 1923), the trend of China's silk industry will only decline year by year, and it is almost hopeless to reverse the decline. The first reason is the defects of China's silk industry itself, which cannot compete with foreign silk industries. Because the burden and poverty of Chinese farmers are so serious that no farmers in any independent country in the world can compare. They are unable to improve silkworm and mulberry varieties, unable to enjoy the benefits of modern technology, and the inherited silkworm rearing methods and the harsh environment make their products unable to compete with those raised under scientific rearing. Overseas sales are therefore taken away by countries such as India. Although the government has now issued silk regulations, hoping to improve silk, if one does not forget the past and present achievements, one can only say that this will only add to the burden of farmers, and the contribution to the real improvement of the silk industry is probably minimal.</p>
<p>Secondly, the silk industry has become an aging industry in today's world. The rapid development of the rayon industry has encroached on the field of natural silk, causing the sales of silk to be drastically eliminated and reduced. In recent years, the rapid progress of the rayon industry in countries such as Japan, the United States, Italy, and Germany, and the increasing use of rayon to replace natural silk, show that the foothold of this aging industry is becoming more difficult year by year. Even if rayon cannot completely replace natural silk, and the latter retains advantages that cannot be eliminated, there is no doubt that its past glorious position has been deprived. Under this situation, the threat faced by the backward Chinese silk industry is even more serious.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it goes without saying that it is the oppression of the Japanese silk industry. At the end of the 19th century, Chinese silk was still a dominant force in the world, but since entering the 20th century, this hegemony has been taken away by Japan, and it has been more than 30 years since then. During these long years, the Japanese silk industry has built a solid barrier, and it is very difficult for the backward Chinese silk industry to break through this barrier and seize world hegemony. Even if this possibility exists in theory, it cannot be achieved in a short period of time. Before that, China's silk industry will always suffer from the oppression and exclusion of Japanese product dumping, and even the weak position in the world market will be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Finally, the world panic is developing, and like ordinary commodities suffering from oversupply and unable to find a way out, the overproduction of the silk industry and the sharp decline in purchasing power caused by the general panic have made silk sales extremely blocked. Although this can be recovered by the resolution of the world panic, not only is there no hope of overcoming the world panic temporarily, but even if there are signs of overcoming it, it is probably impossible to return to the prosperity of the past. Therefore, under the intermingling of these various reasons, the future of China's silk industry is indeed full of thorns. The basis of optimists is probably extremely weak.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Silk Industry in a Panic</h3>
<p>— Lu Hui</p>
<p>Our country's silk industry has always held an important position in foreign trade. In recent years, it has suffered from the shock of the global economic panic, the competitive sales of Japanese silk, and various other complex reasons, resulting in a great decline. The recent situation is even more disastrous, especially for Shanghai silk factories, which are in a state of irreversible decline. In order to understand the actual situation, the author braved the summer heat and conducted investigations in various places for several days, and specially drafted this article based on what he learned, in order to observe the internal conditions of silk factories.</p>
<p>A Few Silk Factories Struggling to Survive</p>
<p>Tracing the origin of China's silk factories, Shanghai is the birthplace of mechanized silk reeling. In terms of its history, it also occupies a central position in the national silk industry. According to a survey in 1930, there were 105 silk factories in Shanghai, with 25,066 silk reeling machines, accounting for more than half of the country's total. They produced more than 7,000 piculs of raw silk per month, employing no less than 100,000 workers, and were rapidly becoming the backbone of China's silk foreign trade. Unexpectedly, good times don't last, and the golden age of the silk industry was swept into the vortex of the global economic panic in that year, marking the beginning of its decline. On the one hand, it was encroached upon by the proliferation of artificial silk, and on the other hand, it was controlled by the competition from Japanese silk. Exports decreased year by year, market prices fell frequently, sales were sluggish, and inventories piled up, resulting in financial difficulties, and closures were common. During 1931 and 1932, although the government issued public bonds twice and exempted export taxes as relief measures, it was ultimately difficult to reverse the raging tide. In the spring of 1933, due to the impact of the United States raising silver prices, silk prices rose accordingly, and silk factories revived their flags, showing a strong trend of recovery. However, after autumn, they returned to their weak state, and the decline intensified, approaching the 500 yuan mark. The losses suffered by manufacturers from this fleeting prosperity were countless, causing general solid entrepreneurs to regard silk factories as a dangerous path and stop in their tracks. The few silk factories opened this spring are all of a temporary nature, mostly struggling to make ends meet and barely operating. Currently, silk prices have plummeted again, resulting in significant losses, and they are constantly in a state of anxiety. Recently, the author completed a survey of Shanghai silk factories that are operating, and presents a list below:</p>
<p>Recent List of Shanghai Silk Factories (January to July 1934)</p>

<p>Li Yuan　208</p>
<p>Bao Tai　322　Robin Hood</p>
<p>Guang Yuan　232　Guang Yuan Mo</p>
<p>Fu Lun　Shuang Gong Factory</p>
<p>The above are 32 silk reeling factories and 1 Shuang Gong factory, totaling 33 factories. Among them, joint ventures account for about two-thirds; those who reel silk for customers account for slightly less than one-third, and those who continued from last year are very few. The total number of silk reeling machines is 7,510, only 30% of the number in 1930. The monthly silk reeling volume is about 2,000 piculs, and the annual volume is no more than 20,000 piculs. From this, we can infer that the national silk factory production has greatly decreased compared with 1930, while silk prices continue to decline. Silk, known as a luxury product, is in such a predicament, and the impact of the global economic panic is evident.</p>
<p>This Year's Cocoon Prices Plummet to Unprecedented Levels</p>
<p>In recent years, silk cocoon merchants, seeing the severity of the market decline and the deep failures of the past, are frightened at the mere mention of it and have a terrible impression. They dare not try easily, except for those who cannot give up or who, seeing the desolate cocoon market this spring, are bound to organize a situation by collecting capital from east and west. The amount of their funds generally does not exceed several thousand yuan. (There is no shortage of strong people but the number is small.) As usual: Those with better credit often hand over all their funds to silver shops, requesting loans to start collecting cocoons. (Credit loans seem rare.) The amount of loans is determined by the borrower's credit, with ordinary loans being three times the total capital (based on collateral), but they are absolutely subject to the lender's supervision, going to the cocoon area to handle cocoons together, and the collected cocoons are transported to Shanghai and deposited in the designated warehouse as collateral, and mobile funds are raised to ship the goods in batches for reeling raw silk.</p>
<p>However, this year's method is also rare. Because the silk market has declined for years, and the silver shops that have suffered losses from silk cocoon loans are countless; therefore, some absolutely refuse to lend to silk cocoons. It's difficult to revitalize the silk industry and this is one of the main reasons. This spring, silk merchants' cocoon collection methods are mostly to raise and carry a small amount of cash, and some go to the mainland and entrust the cocoon firm owners to use the money on their behalf, and some even borrow from silkworm farmers on the credit guarantee of the firm owners. Cases of silkworm farmers being deceived by this dangerous attempt have been heard many times.</p>
<p>This spring's cocoon market was as expected. Although silkworm breeding in Jiangsu and Zhejiang decreased significantly compared with previous years, the harvests were abundant and smooth. However, cocoon markets opening in various places were as rare as morning stars, resulting in congested sales and plummeting cocoon prices, causing silkworm farmers to lose money instead, creating an unprecedented phenomenon. The author has explored and sought the truth from various parties. According to Mr. Zhu Wenqiao of Gongda Silk Factory on Zhongxing Road, the situation is quite detailed. Mr. Zhu has been in and out of the mainland of Jiangsu and Zhejiang for many years, handling cocoon affairs and personally experiencing them, and his knowledge is accurate. He shared with us the record of spring cocoon price changes in the major cocoon-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the past five years, which is listed below:</p>
<p>Table of Cocoon Price Changes in Major Silkworm Areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the Last Five Years (Unit Price per Picul in Yuan)</p>
<p>Province County　Type　Price　1930　1932　1936</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>Highest　Lowest　Highest　Lowest　Highest　Lowest</p>
<p>Wuxi　Improved　120　90　95　70　40　34</p>
<p>Liyang　Improved　100　80　65　55　34　26</p>
<p>Local　60　45　50　40　26　18</p>
<p>Suzhou　Improved　70　60كنولوجيا60　50　32　26</p>
<p>Local　60　45　50　38　28　20</p>
<p>Hangzhou　Improved　70　60　60　50　27　20</p>
<p>Local　60　45　50　40　20　14</p>
<p>Shaoxing　Improved　75　65　60　50　27　20</p>
<p>Local　65　50　50　40　20　14</p>
<p>Jiaxing　Improved　80　68　60　50　28　20</p>
<p>Local　70　55　50　40　20　15</p>
<p>(Note) (1) All average numbers are obtained by collectively averaging the total value of cocoon collection in each producing area.</p>
<p>(2) Values ​​vary from place to place, depending on the quality of the cocoons and the size of the reeling ratio.</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, the prices of cocoons in various places have been falling year after year, forming a straight downward line. Taking Wuxi improved cocoons as an example, the highest price in 1930 was 120 yuan, and in 1932 there was still a record of 95 yuan, while this year the highest price is only 40 yuan, which is one-third of the high price in 1930. Compared with other regions, this still occupies a superior position (efforts to improve silkworm breeding are not in vain). The average prices in Hangzhou and Shaoxing are even within 20 yuan, which is truly an astonishing phenomenon. The profit and loss of silkworm harvesting has always been relied upon by farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang for their annual income and expenditure and is related to the entire rural economy. With such an encounter, how can we ask the countryside not to collapse?</p>
<p>Although Costs are Low, Losses are Still Required</p>
<p>According to the above, cocoon prices are surprisingly cheap, and silk costs are naturally low, so silk reeling manufacturers should have profits to occupy. However, the prevalence of the recession is like the scorching sun in the sky, and the earth is covered with scorching heat. Recently, silk sales have been sluggish and market prices have fallen sharply. The pain felt by manufacturers is the same as that of silkworm farmers, or even more severe. The recent silk prices are compared with previous years in the table below:</p>
<p>1930 (Price Unit in Taels)　1932 (Price Unit in Taels)　1934 (January to July Price Unit in Yuan)</p>
<p>Grade　Evenness of Filaments　Price　Highest　Lowest　Highest　Lowest　Highest　Lowest</p>
<p>A 字　1322　85　1,250　900　850　600　780　640</p>
<p>B 字　1322　80　1,150　880　810　540　500　420</p>
<p>C 字　1322　75　1,050　770　780　510　480　400</p>
<p>Note (1) The prices in this table are estimated based on the accumulated sales prices of a silk factory and with reference to market conditions. The high price of A-grade is the price of the factory's super-grade products. However, the output is very small and the transaction is rare.</p>
<p>(2) The price unit this year is (yuan), and the previous two items are (taels). Because the tael has not been abolished at that time, it is still used for accuracy.</p>
<p>At present, Shanghai factory silk that can meet the A-grade standard is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. The conditions for its finished product must have strong capital, scientific equipment, reasonable management, and excellent work to achieve this. In Shanghai, it is feared that not even one silk factory can be found that meets these conditions. Most of them are simply and crudely made, and there is no long-term vision for international competition. This is also one of the main reasons why China's silk industry cannot compete strongly in the international market. Therefore, the most common grades traded on the market are B and C. Looking at the table above, the highest price of B-grade factory silk in 1930 was 1,150 taels, but the lowest was 880 taels, indicating that the silk price had shown a huge drop rate in that year. Silk factories began to panic in that year and requested the government to issue public bonds in order to save the situation. Stimulated by the outcry, the following year, the government approved the issuance of 8 million yuan in public bonds, with one-quarter for improving sericulture, one-quarter for improving silk factory equipment, and two-quarters for providing relief to silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Shanghai factories naturally benefited from this and barely survived the difficulties. By 1932, after the impact of the January 28 Incident, silk factories were in an even more difficult position. Market prices fell to 540 taels, sales were sluggish and inventories accumulated, and there was no way to turn around. Manufacturers then requested public bonds. The government was concerned about industry and did as requested, handling the registration of old silk and old cocoons and rewarding the export of raw silk by 100 yuan per picul, and exempting customs duties, which was completed last spring. Judging from the results, it was only a temporary solution to hunger and did not help the development of the entire silk industry. Recently, the price of B-grade silk has been approaching the 400 yuan mark, but it is still a seller's market with no buyers, and there are many hidden reefs in the future.</p>
<p>Let us try to calculate the cost with Wuxi cocoons. According to the survey, each picul of silk requires 420 catties of dry cocoons, worth 463 yuan, plus about 80 yuan for processing costs. After deducting about 47 yuan for by-product income (referring to silk reeling waste or parts that cannot be reeled), the net cost of each picul of raw silk is estimated to be 496 yuan, even if it can be reeled into top-grade factory silk, it is already difficult to make a profit. If cocoons from Hangzhou and Shaoxing are used, on the surface, the cocoon prices seem to be lower, but their cocoon quality is mediocre and the reeling ratio is larger. They can only reel B and C grades, and the cost must be at least 450-460 yuan. According to the market price in the table above, roughly estimated, each picul must lose 50 yuan. Recently, silk factories have gradually become unsustainable, and the calls for help are rising. Is this accidental?</p>
<p>In short, the global economic panic is still in full swing, and all industries are depressed, causing and affecting each other, making the purchasing power of the general public extremely weak. Commodities are all oversupplied, and raw silk cannot be an exception. Therefore, unless the global panic goes away one day, silk sales will be difficult to recover one day. It is like a dream to seek the revival of the silk industry. However, the global panic will eventually subside, but if China's silk industry is not transformed from the aspects of scientificization, rationalization, and internationalization, it will lack hope of prosperity!</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Call Loans Remain at Seven Percent</p>
<p>Silver Coin Prices Continue to Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the market was mainly focused on the holiday of banks. Only the money shops were slightly active, so the situation was extremely stable. The call loan market remained at seven percent in the morning and afternoon, similar to the previous day. Call loan transactions were slightly less than usual, with over 3.3 million in clearing and new transactions in the morning session, over 400,000 in the afternoon session, over 200,000 in the Small General Association, and only over 300,000 in pawn transactions. Money shops received over 32.2 million in silver official notes and remitted over 400,000 in remittances from various locations. The rest was suspended due to the bank holiday. The auxiliary currency market remained extremely weak. Jiangnan silver coins opened at 835 yuan in the morning session and changed to 834 yuan in the afternoon session, eventually falling by two yuan. The transaction volume was 3,000 jiao in the morning session and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Guangdong silver coins were 728.2 yuan in the morning session and 727.5 yuan in the afternoon session, also decreasing by one yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 80,000 jiao in the morning session and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins were still able to hold their ground, remaining at 331,500 wen, with a transaction value of 7,000 yuan, equivalent to 23,205 strings of wen.</p>

<h3>Bond Market Still Traded in Two Sessions Last Week</h3>
<p>Market Fluctuations Quite Significant</p>
<p>Public Sentiment Unable to Recover</p>
<p>Last week, from July 30th to August 4th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange temporarily changed to half-day two-session trading due to the hot weather. Although the term had expired, it was extended for another two and a half weeks. After the 17th, it will still be traded in four sessions, so it is still only traded in two sessions at present, but the transaction volume has not decreased. The market fluctuations were quite significant. Initially, due to Huang Fu's impending trip to the north and the Ministry's disapproval of modifying the reserve funds of the Savings Bank, the number of chips on the market was exhausted, leading to a sharp rise. Subsequently, No. 4 was sold off frantically, and the market price was almost entirely under the high pressure of No. 4's selling orders. In addition, due to the rampant bandits, public sentiment became more depressed. At the weekend, there was a slight rebound. The market price trend was initially that retail investors were eager to buy, so the market was booming, and there was a sense that it could not be suppressed. Subsequently, due to the frenzied selling of No. 4, the general short sellers took the opportunity to buy up, and the number of chips on the market felt loose and indiscriminate. Ultimately, due to the poor environmental news and the inability of public sentiment to recover, it is not easy to rise sharply in the short term. It may be inevitable to brew and hover. Last week, due to Huang Fu's impending trip to the north, the Savings Reserve Regulations had been announced, and the number of grain surface chips was suddenly exhausted. The market price rose sharply by several jiao to one and a half yuan on Monday. On Tuesday, the market price was good for the first few corners and small for the last few, which was completely oppressed by No. 4's frenzied selling. On Wednesday, there was nothing else to do. Just because No. 4 continued to sell off, it became more and more crazy, and the market price continued to be small for two or three corners to one yuan and two or three corners. On Thursday, the selling was still strong. At this point, public sentiment had been devastated several times. In addition to the short covering, new purchases had decreased. Public sentiment was depressed and it was not easy to recover. On Friday, rumors of bandits in Fujian rose again, and the market atmosphere was even more virtual. The banking community strongly opposed the Bank Savings Regulations, and public sentiment was even weaker, followed by a small one yuan Xu. On Saturday, the short sellers had a slight offset, returning to a few corners to one yuan Xu. As a result of the weekly market price, the rise and fall were very small. Most of them were good for three or four corners, and a few had a small two or three corners. The total turnover was 107.471 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton, US Cotton, Poor Western Forecasts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was quiet and firm due to poor forecasts in the west, short covering, and a lack of sellers. As a result, spot prices rose by five points and futures prices rose by six to eleven points. British cotton was closed. The Indian cotton market was sluggish, with minimal fluctuations. As a result, Pingal fell by half a rupee, Amlra fell by 0.25 rupees, and Bailuo Creek fell by one rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 4th):</p>

<p>Hsiakwan Rice Market Still Strong</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were extremely balanced due to the prolonged drought and the drying up of the inner harbor. Only 14 or 15 were present (goods nearly 3,000 piculs). Public sentiment also rose accordingly, and the market was strong. However, in view of the overall situation of the city, all transactions were small-ticket transactions. It is estimated that the prices of each thick japonica and late rice continue to increase by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan, Du Yangjian by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. Due to the long-term shortage of goods, Yinyuan has been exhausted, so the price has risen by 0.4 or 0.5 yuan. Pudong Xinqiang continues to open at 11 yuan due to the normal way out.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 12 or 13 sources from Hsiakwan. The outgoing goods on the market were quite active in the morning. The guests shouted tightly because the prices in the producing areas rose. The zero stomach turned slack in the afternoon. The white japonica price on the market increased by about 0.2 yuan again. The white yuan and thin rice were tightly near the corner, and the Yang Du Jian increased by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. The port customers went up 0.2 yuan outside. Dong Xinjiang continued to arrive. Ling Hua was still alive and the price was set.</p>

<h3>Killing Dogs and Protecting Dogs</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Recently, the newspapers carried two remotely echoing news items: one is the Jinan city authorities killing dogs, and the other is the Shanghai Society for the Protection of Animals protecting dogs. Although both are trivial matters, unrelated to the grand scheme, they ultimately concern life and death, so it's worth discussing. According to a dispatch from Jinan, the city has always had many stray dogs, rampant everywhere. Not only is their incessant barking annoying, but mad dogs are also frequently discovered, posing a significant threat to the safety of citizens. In view of this, the municipal government specially obtained approval from the provincial government chairman to execute over two thousand stray dogs accumulated in the dog pound at the foot of Thousand Buddha Mountain on July 11th. The Chinese Society for the Protection of Animals in Shanghai, noting that the French Concession has recently been capturing stray dogs in a very cruel manner, specially convened a meeting and decided to send people to investigate. They believe that the original stray dog shelter in Longhua has long been abandoned and should be restored to house and care for the dogs, valuing their lives.</p>
<p>The term "dog" often evokes similar things, but the fact that only stray dogs are being shot makes people feel somewhat uneasy. Because once they become dogs, they have no humanity to speak of. They always protect their owners and bark and bite at others. Moreover, the house dogs in their prime are even more annoying, relying solely on their master's power, "maliciously guarding the door." A moment of carelessness can lead to being bitten and losing a piece of flesh. As for their unbridled tyranny, showing off their arrogance, and their unparalleled conceit, it not only makes people "look askance" but is also "utterly infuriating." Therefore, it is not only stray dogs that deserve to be killed.</p>
<p>As for the Society for the Protection of Animals' opposition to the capture and killing of stray dogs, it is based on compassion, the so-called "Heaven has the virtue of loving life." However, such measures are also "clearly discerning the tip of an autumn hair but not seeing a cartload of firewood." Because besides stray dogs, countless other "animals," such as livestock and poultry, are captured and killed. Why do stray dogs receive special treatment, while large livestock like cattle and horses do not receive this kind of grace? It is incomprehensible. Showing concern for life to the extent of caring for the wild dogs among the animals is compassionate indeed, benevolent indeed. However, when we read Mencius's words, "Now your kindness is sufficient to reach animals but your merit does not extend to the people," it is truly admirable because his words are very measured. No wonder he also gets to eat cold meat.</p>
<p>From the event of stray dogs being killed in Jinan, perhaps many house dogs will express joy. But they should not get carried away. House dogs also face the danger of being killed sometimes. Haven't you heard the ancient Chinese saying, "When the birds are gone, the good bow is stored away; when the hare dies, the hunting dog is cooked"? Even among the stormtroopers who enabled Hitler to seize power in Germany on June 30, many leaders were killed by "Chaplin's mustache." Although they are not dogs but people, they are still animals.</p>
<h3>Locust Plague</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>The people in the countryside are suffering too much. They have suffered the misery of war and banditry, and the pain of foreign invasion and domestic turmoil. In recent years, they have also been tormented by natural and man-made disasters. This kind of suffering truly makes ordinary farmers want to cry but have no tears to shed.</p>
<p>This year, after the start of summer, the provinces south of the Yangtze River suffered from severe drought. However, following the drought, a locust plague came.</p>
<p>One afternoon, around four o'clock: a swarm of locusts flew in from somewhere, covering the sky and blocking out the sun, numbering hundreds of millions. The whirring sound was like a strong wind. At the time, the sun was also obscured, as if it were about to rain.</p>
<p>"Mom! Look! Where did all these big grasshoppers come from!" the children shouted happily.</p>
<p>"Little devil! These are locusts. Don't disturb the Locust God, quickly kneel down and pray, asking him not to come to our fields. Locusts eat rice. If they eat our rice, you'll be hungry!" a middle-aged woman anxiously told her son, Little Dog. She herself was also praying with her hands clasped, a look of panic on her face, as if a heavy stone was pressing on her heart.</p>
<p>The ignorant children, listening to their mother's words, actually knelt down to pray, murmuring in their little mouths:</p>
<p>"Locust God, please don't come to our fields."</p>
<p>However, the Locust God would not accept their sincere prayers and finally descended from the sky, falling like raindrops on every field!</p>
<p>Thus, misery and panic again assaulted the hearts of every farmer. They watched as the seedlings they had painstakingly grown were not only withered by the drought but also devoured by the locusts.</p>
<p>"Dog Dad! Quickly get the incense and candles, go to the edge of the field to pray to the Locust God. If they eat our rice, not to mention that we won't have food for our family for the year, but we still have to pay half the rent in grain..." Dog Mom was also worried about their rice, afraid that the Locust God would come and visit.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Jinsheng! Have you prepared the incense and candles yet? Hurry up and burn them, it'll be terrible if they eat everything before you do!" Granny Wang was very calm herself but was anxious for others.</p>
<p>"People are too bad now, so God is punishing you people with some disasters. Look, now men are not like men, women are not like women, what kind of world is this? Maybe it will really come to a time when there is rice but no one to eat it, roads but no one to walk on, houses but no one to live in before there will be peace!" Grandpa Wang San seemed to have foresight and expressed his opinion.</p>
<p>Incense, candles, and silver ingots were burned beside every field. The gray-white smoke rose slowly. Many wisps of smoke flew into the air and merged together, turning into a layer of white mist. The farmers' hearts were also boiling in hot blood, simmering thousands of red hearts together.</p>
<p>From day to night, from dark to dawn, the locusts spread all over every field and did not fly away. The farmers really had no way to think. It was ineffective to pray to the Locust God, so they went to pray to the local Buddha. Thus, the City God Temple, the Land God Shrine, and the Fierce General Hall were all crowded with pilgrims. The winding incense smoke and the brilliant red candles made the temple smoky. The prayer cushions in front of the Buddha statues were filled with pleading worshipers, knocking their heads like pounding garlic.</p>
<p>Finally, after a collective discussion by the majority of the farmers, initiated by the village head, they invited the Fierce General to patrol the fields to carry out locust-driving work.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, many villagers went to the Fierce General Hall and respectfully invited out a clay and wood statue of the Fierce General. At the same time, they also brought a Land God, carrying him on a sedan chair to patrol the fields. Wherever they went, incense and candles were stuck in the ground and silver ingots were burned. Many people knelt beside their fields and worshipped, a situation that was both pathetic and ridiculous.</p>
<p>By nearly dusk, the locust-driving work</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>finally came to a successful completion. The Land God returned to his palace, and the Fierce General also returned to his seat. The farmers' fatigue from the day, or perhaps it could be said their excitement, led them to fall asleep soundly in their beds that night. When the sky barely dawned the next morning, they rushed to their fields to see if the locusts had been driven away.</p>
<p>Indeed, the locusts had all flown away, but so had the seedlings. What could they do?</p>
<p>"It's over, it's all over! We worked so hard for days and nights without sleeping or eating, busy opening the sluices and drawing water, just to save many seedlings from the drought. We were hoping that this year's autumn harvest would have some promise, but who knew they would be eaten by locusts. We are truly not meant to live!" The farmers looked at each other and sighed. Dozens of pairs of eyes filled with disappointment and sorrow were focused on the stems of the seedlings that had been eaten clean.</p>
<h3>Snatching Food</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>Li Awu, the scab-headed fellow, with his tall body, thick arms like iron, and hairy legs like bone clubs, was very strong and walked with a peculiar air, like a wild buffalo. He had such a sturdy body and strong strength, yet he was doing such a useless thing. He himself couldn't figure it out. Empty-handed, he couldn't go hungry. What else could he do to make a living? He had been eating leftover cold rice from this household for who knows how many days.</p>
<p>He ate other people's leftover rice, but there were also those who ate his leftover rice's leftovers.</p>
<p>Although it was leftover rice, there were too many people eating it, so it was not easy to eat even leftover rice. But the scab-headed Li Awu had plenty of strength and sturdy hairy legs. Therefore, he became a hero among his companions. When arguing, he could hold off ten people. Just a light punch or kick from him would hurt right in the spine, and the pain would last for several nights. Moreover, he had a bad temper like a dog. If something wasn't right, he would glare at people's necks and start fighting. Who wouldn't be afraid of him like that?</p>
<p>Every day, he wandered around and, when the time came, stood outside the paper shop's door. Waiting for the person delivering the rice to come and collect the things, his small black cloth bag would immediately be filled with leftover cold rice and vegetables. He would go to a quiet alley nearby and swallow it down in large mouthfuls, happily. The leftovers would be distributed to his other companions.</p>
<p>Many days passed like this, with the scab-headed Li Awu eating the leftover rice from the paper shop. Almost everyone among his companions knew about it. No one wanted to take his place or compete for this meal because his thick arms and sturdy hairy legs were famous.</p>
<p>But the situation suddenly changed. For several days, Li Awu was a little late, and the rice was always taken away by others first. He couldn't be too late. He didn't believe that anyone would be so bold as to covet his guaranteed meal.</p>
<p>So, that night, Li Awu specially stood in front of the paper shop door early, waiting to see who was taking away his rice. Soon enough, two strong young men came and stopped by the door as well. Li Awu couldn't stop himself and asked with a fierce look:</p>
<p>"Hey, little pigs, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>The two were from elsewhere and didn't know who Li Awu was. They answered in unison, "Waiting for food." Their tone was somewhat blunt and forceful.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Li Awu's anger immediately shot through his brain. He had never suffered this kind of frustration. How could he bear it? So, while clenching his fist as big as a bowl, he approached and shouted with a sharp voice:</p>
<p>"Good kid, your eyes are on the back of your head. Waiting for food? Can you see my fist?"</p>
<p>However, the two didn't show any fear on their faces, nor did they intend to leave. They just glanced at Li Awu, not moving or saying a word.</p>
<p>Seeing that, Li Awu couldn't restrain himself any longer. He couldn't help but act. So, he shook his upper body a few times, exerted all his strength, aimed at the chest of one of them, and punched him hard. Then, he kicked the other in the lower abdomen with his left foot. The young man didn't expect it and stumbled back a few steps before falling with a thud.</p>
<p>The other one saw that something was wrong and immediately ran away. The one who fell on the ground cursed in his mouth and struggled for a long time before getting up.</p>
<p>By the time the red-headed Indian policeman rushed up, Li Awu had already used his hairy legs and slipped away quickly. The young man who was knocked down was unlucky enough to receive a few heavy blows from the policeman's club.</p>
<h3>A String of Nonsense</h3>
<p>— Wen Gai</p>
<p>People who have food to eat often don't want to eat. People who often want to eat don't have food to eat.</p>
<p>In ancient times, an emperor heard that people in a certain place were starving and had no food to eat, and he said, "Why don't they eat meat porridge?"</p>
<p>People who have food to eat don't believe that others necessarily need to eat because they often feel that three meals a day are annoying.</p>
<p>People who don't have money don't cherish using money. People who spend money also don't cherish using money. People who treat money like their lives are those who have money.</p>
<p>People who work don't advise others to work. People who advise others to work don't work.</p>
<p>The least likely to believe in God are those who advise others to believe in God.</p>
<p>Monks are people who are detached from worldly desires, but they will still go to court for temple property.</p>
<p>As the times have developed to the present, priests, pastors, monks, and nuns have all become a type of profession. God and the Buddhas in heaven probably don't know what to think.</p>
<p>A Taoist temple on XX Road has a funeral canopy erected in front of it. The Taoist's father has died, and his religious founder's tablet is also mourning.</p>
<p>The believers themselves have now overthrown religion. However, the living Buddha is still fashionable. This is probably because he is alive.</p>
<h3>Girl Writer</h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>After the previous work "Boy Writer," someone said to me, "Since there is a 'Boy Writer,' why is there no 'Girl Writer'?" Although the statement is almost "a clever remark," how could we poor writers, sitting with our buttocks on the tip of our pens, not be overjoyed, thinking it a worthy topic! Therefore, I wrote this piece to earn money for next month's cigarettes.</p>
<p>Time slipped from morning to afternoon. It's twelve o'clock!</p>
<p>The girl writer had just sent the editor of XX Magazine out, her smile deep enough to put a finger in. She pinched the palm of her hand that had just been tightly grasped by the editor, as if she could still feel a strange sensation from the pressure of his enthusiastic hand. She turned her snake-like waist like a light swallow:</p>
<p>"Zhang Ma! Zhang Ma! Come, come, come."</p>
<p>The one called Zhang Ma was a nanny-type short, stout woman who ran up wobbly, her face as kind as a large bunch of roses:</p>
<p>"Miss, good Miss, what are your orders?"</p>
<p>The girl writer turned her head and thought for a long time, unable to think of anything:</p>
<p>"Oh dear! I forgot what it was all about!"</p>
<p>The girl writer smiled, and Zhang Ma followed suit.</p>
<p>The girl writer turned and walked into her study.</p>
<p>It was luxurious enough!</p>
<p>Sitting on the swivel chair, she remembered another thing:</p>
<p>"Zhang Ma, bring the letters the postman delivered."</p>
<p>After a while, Zhang Ma wobbled and brought a large stack of letters.</p>
<p>This stack of letters was about two inches thick: pink, light green, light yellow, big, small...</p>
<p>The girl writer took them over and lightly scolded:</p>
<p>"How annoying! So many letters!"</p>
<p>The first letter was light green. Opening it, there was a silver-patterned letterhead:</p>
<p>Dearest:</p>
<p>I have received your letter from yesterday. Thank you. I am truly grateful that you could write to me in your busy schedule. Dearest, the novel you asked me to write, "Lonely Flower," is now completed. I am sending it now, hoping you will help me revise it properly...</p>
<p>The girl writer, having seen this far, didn't read any further. She picked up the "Lonely Flower," quickly signed her name, "Ms. XX," under the title, folded it up, put it in an envelope, scribbled a bunch of words on the envelope, and called out again:</p>
<p>"Zhang Ma!"</p>
<p>Zhang Ma, who had been waiting at the door, was already standing in front of the girl writer.</p>
<p>"Tell Ah San to send this letter to the home of that Mr. X who just left!"</p>
<p>Zhang Ma replied, "Yes," and went to convey the girl writer's order.</p>
<p>The second letter was pink. Opening it, it was from the literary column editor of XX Monthly:</p>
<p>Ms. XX, no, admirable genius poet:</p>
<p>If this month's XX Monthly doesn't have your poems, how disappointed will the readers be...</p>
<p>Of course, the girl writer didn't finish reading this letter either. She put it aside and picked up another letter. She opened it up and took out a manuscript of a poem: "I Will One Day..."</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the girl writer signed "Ms. XX" below it again. Just as she was about to put it in another envelope, she somehow pulled it back and, for the first time, read it line by line:</p>
<p>I will one day grab your slender waist, and hold your slender waist tightly; if you don't gently say "okay," I wouldn't be willing to let you go even if I die.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>I will one day grab your slender waist; and hold your slender waist tightly; It's okay if you scold me lightly, it's okay if you quietly scold me!</p>
<h3>Remembering Peace Lane, Bianliang</h3>
<p>— Yangyang</p>
<p>"The warm breeze intoxicates the traveler, making him mistake Hangzhou for Bianzhou."</p>
<p>This is a poem by an ancient poet praising "Bianliang City." In other words, people are originally playing in Hangzhou, but because the warm breeze intoxicates their hearts, the impressions in their minds suddenly become active, touching the dust of the past, and they wonder if they are in Hangzhou! At the same time, we can also know that the scenery of "Bianjing" is no less than that of the beautiful "West Lake." If not, there are many places in China that can be called "scenic spots." Why single out Bianzhou and Hangzhou for comparison?</p>
<p>Now is the time when the warm breeze intoxicates people, and the scenery before my eyes can't help but arouse old memories, reminding me of Bianliang. It's really unbearable to look back! Bianzhou, in our Chinese territory, originally belonged to Henan Province, now called Kaifeng. In the Northern Song Dynasty, it was once built as the capital, and it is indeed a famous ancient city. It and the modern revolutionary government's planned Western Capital (secondary capital) Luoyang stand side by side on the Bianluo branch line of the Jinghan Railway, both adapting to local conditions and becoming famous and historically valuable. I remember when the national crisis was imminent, during the January 28 Incident and the bloody battle of Shanghai, at a critical juncture, the government, in order to prepare for a rainy day, moved the National Government to Luoyang. Bianliang, which had been desolate for many years, followed the prosperity of Luoyang once the market was bustling, and it unexpectedly became lively with smoke and noise.</p>
<p>Qipaos revealing the chest, high heels and bare legs, slender eyebrows reaching the temples, thick makeup, and all kinds of modern fashion, I dare say that before the National Government moved to Luoyang, not only in Kaifeng, but throughout Henan Province, all the women, whether native, whether good families or prostitutes, were simply impossible to find. As a result, the "Luoyang daughters" and Bianliang sisters were greatly influenced by the customs of the wives of officials from other places. Among them, the Peace Lane in Kaifeng was especially notable, with swallows chirping and orioles singing, red and green, welcoming and seeing off, zithers, pipes, and pens, not stopping all night long. Its enchanting scenery had the same magic as the Eight Great Hutongs in Beijing and the Three No-Man's Lands in Tianjin, attracting tourists. Peace Lane is commonly known as Fourth Lane. There are also four small intersecting alleys within the lane. Before Henan Province implemented the ban on prostitution, the facts told us that Kaifeng Peace Lane had about 70 or 80 brothels, each with about six or seven prostitutes, or five or six prostitutes each, averaging around 500 in total. As for the procedures for indulging in licentiousness, they were also very similar to those in Beijing and Tianjin. If you really wanted to indulge, you didn't need to play cards, set up wine, or anything like that. You only needed to take out a tip of fifteen yuan, and you could call for the girl to come to your room. A tea gathering was one silver dollar, and calling for a "strip" (presumably a type of service) was double that. It was straightforward and extremely pleasant. Since brothels are groups that solve sexual desires, as recognized by the world's humanity, why bother with so many decorations and pretenses, what "selling art but not selling the body?" That is just burying your head in the sand, deceiving yourself and others, just to practice their "gold-digging doctrine"!</p>
<p>Although Peace Lane was the territory of Kaifeng's brothels, there were indeed many private prostitutes filling it. As for the issue of people, the distinction between the ugly and beautiful was not necessarily limited to the saying "Above is heaven, below are Suzhou and Hangzhou." It should be known that within ten steps, there is no lack of fragrant grass, and the daughters of Bian and Luo with pleasing faces are far more than the "West Lake Shi Shi."</p>
<h3>Powdered Faces, Red Lips and Emerald Brows</h3>
<p>— Yangyang</p>
<p>Is this the typical modern woman?</p>
<p>Before heading out, wives, grandmothers, and young ladies must primp in front of the mirror, rushing about, hands and feet in a flurry, diligently preparing their appearance. However, women naturally love to adorn themselves, and not just when going out. Often, even when staying home, they must be neatly and impeccably groomed, sometimes re-touching their makeup and changing outfits several times from morning till night. The descriptions such as "apricot blossoms fading above the evening makeup tower" and "a beauty gazes into the mirror before sleep," these elegant verses have long been recited and circulated. It is clear that it is a long-standing custom for women to be in their boudoirs all day, not only during the day, but even when sleeping at night, they must appear as ethereal as celestial beings. It is truly fascinating.</p>
<p>The creation of a woman’s powdered face and red lips is no less arduous and time-consuming than the lead actor playing Zhao Kuangyin in "Beheading the Yellow Robe" backstage at the theater. I once saw a glittering modern flower, during her application of thick makeup, repeatedly applying and washing off, washing off and applying, as many as seven times. It is said that if the work is not so frequent, the foundation will not be strong and lasting, and the red and white will not be clearly defined. Such painstaking effort is enough to call her an expert in applying makeup of her generation. Occasionally, thinking about it still leaves me in admiration!</p>
<p>A foreign newspaper once carried the following news: "In the modern women's circles of Paris, the epitome of beauty is to apply chemical green rouge to the shallow dimples on the cheeks, which is very popular." If this trend soon migrates to the East, then the cherished white powder and red rouge of Chinese ladies will all be retired! At the same time, many green-faced tigers with protruding breasts and plump arms will be added to the streets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the modern fashionable eyebrow must be slender, long and reach the temples to be considered precious. However, "emerald drops from distant mountains, dark ink condenses like autumn water," is not a natural endowment, but entirely artificial. Here, I am again reminded of the actors on the stage. Whether they are male, female, painted-face, or supporting male role, before applying face paint backstage, the first task is to draw eyebrows. For example, Huang Tianba's thick eyebrows connecting to his temples, extended to the likes of Cao Cao, Yan Song, and Sima Yi, white-faced with brushed eyebrows, each has its own characteristics and functions. In other words, they respectively represent their loyalty, treachery, goodness, evil, heroism, stubbornness, and other personalities. Only, I do not know what symbolism the currently popular "one-line eyebrow" represents. Saying she is enchanting and charming? That is not necessarily true!</p>
<p>I remember the Western Chamber, praising Miss Cui's eyebrows, saying: "Palace-style eyebrows, like a crescent moon, encroach upon the clouds of her temples." Whether the method of drawing eyebrows of Miss Shuangwen was exactly the same as today's fashionable eyebrows, or slightly different? Unfortunately, there is no way to guess. And then there's my "Brother Ah Chang," he is also an eyebrow-drawing expert, yet equally causes one to sigh, "I was not fortunate enough to see the ancients!" It's truly helpless!</p>

<h3>A Certain Night (5)</h3>
<p>— Li Huaiying</p>
<p>Mrs. Sun accepted and sang a section of "Meng Jiang Nu". This tune originally doesn't easily make people happy, on the contrary it easily sinks people into painful situations; their situation and Meng Jiang Nu's have similar points, but Meng Jiang Nu could still look for her husband by the Great Wall, they're afraid they won't be able to reach the border of Xinjiang even if they die! When she sang the second section, everyone was crying, the voice she sang with also turned hoarse, it was also like a wail, until after Mrs. Liu requested her to stop, she cleaned up the singing. Mrs. Liu then followed up with a long sigh:</p>
<p>"Ah!丨丨"</p>
<p>The house was occupied by hot tears and low sobbing sounds, deathly still.</p>
<p>They thought of that scene when they retreated in Jilin, to this day they still couldn't stop their hearts racing. Japanese soldiers, like fierce tigers and wolves, riding on military vehicles, firing machine guns chasing after them, the front and back were only a mile away, if they didn't retreat to the Russian border, they wouldn't have any lives left, yes, they certainly would've died in their hands.</p>
<p>But why didn't they just die there? Wouldn't that be a very glorious thing, to die under their guns for the sake of resisting Japan? At the time till now, lingering on for more than two years, they're about to starve to death in front of their countrymen, they, no one expected this step. Isn't this also something that people can't explain, it's somewhat embarrassing to talk about.</p>
<p>"Drink wine!"</p>
<p>Meng Zhi shouted this out, Mrs. Xing ran down the stairs in three steps and two steps.</p>
<p>Here, they coincidentally stopped their tears, silently looked at each other face to face. Mrs. Zheng threw out a bitter smile, and then closed her eyes. Mrs. Liu got up and opened the window she had just closed, turned around, and stretched. Suddenly, she sneezed three times in a row, tears and snot followed and flowed out.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sun was just about to reach for a copy of "The Twice Blooming Plum" to look at, at this time stopped her hand, smiling she said:</p>
<p>"Three hundred years, Mrs. Liu won't starve to death!"</p>
<p>"A thousand-year-old tortoise, a ten-thousand-year-old turtle, a person living to an old age isn't worth anything."</p>
<p>From the opened window, a bit of cool air seeped in, the sounds of the children playing and making noise outside seemed even louder.</p>
<p>These two interesting words from Mrs. Sun and Mrs. Liu caused Mrs. Zheng to open her eyes, as well as Mrs. Ning, the four people cried together silently, in a flash, they discarded their tears, all forgot their central sorrow.</p>
<p>Laughing for a while, crying for a while, happy for a while, sad for a while, they were just circling in the middle of this, what kind of contradiction were they in this night.</p>
<p>A burst of hurried footsteps sounded on the stairs, Mrs. Xing carried three big bottles of white wine into the house, panting without end, her cheeks red, big beads of sweat emerging, on the back of her blue cloth shirt, a large patch of sweat was soaked through. She first put the wine bottles on the table, then took out a packet of peanut powder and a packet of oily soybeans from her bosom.</p>

<h3>A Hollywood Wife's Confession (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Mi Ji</p>
<p>It Is Not Easy Being the Wife of a Famous Movie Star. If You Want to Know The Truth, Please Read Carefully.</p>
<p>As soon as Sylvia saw Tot, she began to pour the flattery on him. She said, "I really didn't expect to meet you, Mr. Fuhulan. Now I'll tell you the truth, I've seen "Nights in Paris" four times. I... I've admired you for a long time... on the screen... from when you first appeared on the screen..." It can be said that her demeanor showed the utmost in seductive skills. Seeing the flattered look on Tot's face, my heart turned cold. Of course, I can't blame him either. It's not a trivial thing for a star like Sylvia to compliment him like that. Later, they danced. When they danced, Sylvia almost melted into Tot's body. Her forehead pressed tightly against Tot's face. They danced for two hours straight. I didn't want to leave... or perhaps it was vanity that drove me. I couldn't let this woman win completely at once. But a few days later, Sylvia actually negotiated with the company to use Tot as the male lead in her next film. This was also a necessary move for her. When they were filming, I didn't go to the studio either. I devoted myself to arranging our home... and I dressed myself as much as possible... within the limits of what the environment allowed. I went to the beauty salon twice a week, I studied my attire as much as possible, and tried to dispel the worries in my heart, forgetting that Sylvia had a reputation for devouring men alive.</p>
<p>"In the evening, Tot came home exhausted after a hard day. At that time, he held me in his arms 丨丨 At that time, the Hollywood that was closely trying to invade our family's harmony was also thrown out of sight. Suddenly one day, I was anxious to discuss something with him, but I couldn't get through on the phone after calling for a long time, so I went to the company myself. I walked straight to his dressing room, wanting to wait for him there. I didn't think to knock first. Well! When I went in, he and Sylvia were together. They didn't hear me come in, but I couldn't back out either. It was as if my feet were nailed to the spot by what I saw. I could only stare blankly, what I had always considered sacred was now peeling off and collapsing piece by piece. She was wearing a white velvet dress. Her soft hands held his head tightly, her fragrant lips desperately sucking on his... They finally woke up as if from a dream and saw me and separated. Tot looked very flustered, but Sylvia said nonchalantly: "Mrs. Fuhulan, please come in. We are rehearsing the next scene. Today's audiences are really demanding, they must perform enthusiastically, and like the real thing..." She said, laughing non-stop. At that moment, I couldn't help but want to strangle her with both hands and crush her to death...</p>
<p>It was on that night that our child came. Tot stayed with me for most of the night, but he had to go out early the next morning to shoot on location. After he left, he was gone for two weeks. During those two weeks, I didn't see anything besides the cold white walls of the hospital. My mind fantasized, Tot in Del Monte 丨丨 with Sylvia 丨丨 as if seeing them walking on the beach, the moonlight gently covering them. At that time, I couldn't help but wish that my man was an ordinary man, coming home from an ordinary office every night, discussing the trivialities of the day's work, helping me decide on the style of clothes, and calculating whether the money was worth it or not. A few days later, Tot came back. He gave me a bracelet inlaid with real diamonds and rubies worth ten thousand dollars, took out my old seventy-five dollar engagement ring, and cried all night. Of course, Tot didn't know this. I felt that if I could continue to persevere as usual, things would naturally improve. But now I think, I don't know how many women in the world are still infatuated with this fantasy! (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Woman" 丨丨 Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Indeed, it is a sign of progress that films in China can seriously pay attention to the discussion of women's issues. However, it is regrettable that not every film on the same issue can provide a correct answer. So what should our evaluation of this "Woman" be in terms of its content?</p>
<p>We will never overlook the author Shi Dongshan's enthusiasm for dealing with the issue. He shouted loudly: Although Chinese women have undergone several liberation movements, up to now, these economic, political, and invisible iron chains are still firmly binding them, causing them to continue to struggle in pain. So she said in the subtitles: "If they do not devote themselves to the social reform movement, any freedom and liberation is just empty talk." This is, in any case, a relatively correct indication.</p>
<p>However, the author did not grasp the core of the issue in the work. Film art thinks through images. Based on the understanding given to us by the pictures, we always feel that this film did not point out a correct way out. It is very obvious that Liang Yufen, Wang Yifang, and Molly are all representatives of the unawakened female side, while the female doctor Jin Lingzhi is a representative of the awakened female. This group of women all come from petty bourgeois backgrounds. The author, based on her own experience, certainly depicts the lives and thoughts of Liang Yufen and her group very vividly. But what kind of liberation movement is shown in Jin Ling? It is very clear that because she cannot have a deep social understanding, the female doctor Jin Ling does not show the true attitude of a women's liberation movement activist. Regarding her, the author carefully describes her thoughts and actions. She is dissatisfied with the principal not allowing dancers to study, and all she can do is angrily leave the school automatically. She encourages her husband to go to the Northeast to engage in rescue, and even teaches her husband to shoulder a gun when necessary, and the people themselves will recover the lost territory. She also treats female workers, but somehow, she always makes people feel very unfamiliar and lacks a full sense of reality. It seems that she is a utopian hero in some places. In the end, she only sheds a few tears of sympathy when she sees the tragedy of Liang Yufen's life. If she gives people a kind of aversion, it is really a loss that the author did not expect.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire work, the author certainly depicts the common diseases of women from the petty bourgeoisie very well. The life of Liang Yufen is a very good example. Love, marriage, and childbirth. In this long process, they suffered all kinds of physiological, economic, and political oppression. The cruelty reflected in a part of women in semi-colonial China under imperialism and feudal forces are all written in great detail by the author. However, the tragedy between them, from Liang Yufen's point of view, does not point out the inevitable reasons. Most clearly, the husband's misbehavior and even depravity, and the child's fire and even Yufen's suicide, are all relatively accidental rather than general themes. If Hong Xiaoting was a well-behaved young man, couldn't she still get by? Especially the latter, that fire was not developed closely in the theme. As a result, that unique climax cannot teach people to have associations, but is just an accidental misfortune. The result is giving us empty and slightly sad stimuli, without a clear concept. However, we believe that the main reason why this film cannot be perfect is that it does not merge this group's liberation with the labor women's movement. This aspect is due to environmental relations, and on the other hand, it may be due to the author's insufficient understanding.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding other technical issues, there are still many that are worth bringing up and discussing with the author: (1) The relationship between Xiaoting and his family is not very clear. The mother can privately remit three hundred yuan to him, but later he would not ask for help from his family when he was down and out. (2) Yufen discovers her husband's secret, and then there is no follow-up. As a result, this stalking is equal to unnecessary. (3) Yufen is reluctant to pawn her wedding ring and replaces it with an old piece of clothing, which is not very easy to understand. If she quickly recalled the excitement of the wedding at that time, it would have been better. (4) "The timing of "the money at the bedside being used up" does not seem very appropriate. How long is that gold chain enough to use? (5) Was Lei Mengna Yufen's classmate before? Was the later female fortune teller also her? Are they the same person before and after? (6) When the father sees his daughter in the hotel, the panning shot should be faster. (7) Before Xiaoting buys the foreign doll and goes to the doctor's house, there is no promotion of the climax, and the timing is also not appropriate. (8) When Xiaoting gives the foreign doll to the dead child, the Tempo is too slow.</p>
<p>However, in summary, this film is generally an outstanding work in Chinese films, and it is also the author's representative work to date. Many places show his excellence and intelligence, and the photography and performance are all very good. We believe that it overwhelms the previous works with women's liberation as the theme.</p>
<h3>It's Hardest to Hear the Swallow's Murmur Again</h3>
<p>The beautiful little swallow had murmured a little bit before going silent until now. The audience in front of the screen is eagerly awaiting the chance to hear her singing, which lingered for three days, and her clear and gentle whispers again! The opportunity has come. The Lianhua film "The Highway", starring her, has been decided to be fully dubbed and sung this year. In addition to the theme song, director Sun Yu also plans to specially compose a song for her to sing. It is said that this is a love song with affectionate sentiments and lingering meaning. The beauty of the melody and the excellence of the lyrics are unprecedented. Chen Yanyan, who has been working hard to learn to sing for more than a year, will sing it with a spit of jade, and it will surely be a popular song in the future.</p>
<h3>Plum Blossom Performance Reschedules Time</h3>
<p>The Plum Blossom Dance Troupe's performance at the New Guang Grand Theater this time, although in the hot summer, is still crowded, which is beyond expectations, so it has specially postponed the trip to Ningbo and continues to perform at the New Guang Theater, and will use wonderful programs to reward the elegant intentions of all circles. Therefore, every time the program is changed, there must be two special major programs performed, so that the audience can have the pleasure of the senses. However, because the actors are too hard and deeply afraid of causing illness, they have specially agreed with the theater to change the performance time from today to two shows every night: from 7:30 to 9:30, and then from 9:30 to 11:30, and there will be no performances during the day, so that the actors can rest and train.</p>

<h3>Good Son, Good Wife (Born to be Kissed) (8)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Pan Qi went back and said to Tom with a amiable smile, "Son, what do you want to say?" When Yidi saw that expression, she showed a flustered look, muttering to herself, "Son!" Tom laughed, "Dad, I'm afraid I can only give you a head start." Pan Qi scolded, "You little..." He said and walked away, letting Tom continue his crazy behavior. They were entangled like this, playing around. Yidi accidentally rolled over the railing and fell into the water. Tom shouted, "Wait for me, let's swim home together." Everyone was climbing on the railing, looking down. Senator Tie Kang said in a panic, "It seems like this lady is about to die, she's about to sink for the second time." Only to hear Tom shout again, "Yidi!" He jumped over the railing and plunged into the water. When he got into the water, he grabbed her and swam to shore holding her.</p>
<p>From that day on, day after day, time passed quickly, like a sweet dream. Yidi had already fallen in love with Tom. She understood it herself, but she tried her best to suppress herself. She tried her best to keep Tom from getting close to her. She tried her best to refuse to accept the diamond bracelet that Tom bought for her. She didn't want to marry him 丨 she was determined. She was going to do it according to her original goal. She often looked at the emerald ring that Kexins gave her. She firmly believed his words and was willing to marry her. One day, Tom took Yidi to the embassy club. Pan Qi and his guests had arrived. Que Li, Tong Na, and Tom were competing to win Yidi's favor. But Yidi's will was very firm. She was determined to be a "good woman"... good for marrying a millionaire... Later, Tong Na told Yidi that Pan Qi was going to enter Beijing that night to meet the president, because he had been internally appointed to be sent to London to attend the disarmament conference as the chairman of the American delegation. When Yidi heard this, it was as if the matter had a close relationship with her. Her eyes widened, as if she had already seen herself as an ambassador's wife, being introduced to the Queen at the British court... Tong Na made up his mind and said again, "Let me tell you, beautiful, you come with me to the north tonight to see Tom off." Yidi said solemnly, "You go see yourself off. I'm a good woman, remember that." Tong Na looked at Yidi with reluctance and said, "You used to tell me that too." Yidi said, "I'm telling you again now."</p>
<p>She saw Tom, he was sitting and talking with his father at a nearby table. She felt that Pan Qi didn't like her very much now... She thought it must be because of Tom. So she asked Tong Na to take her to Pan Qi's table. When Pan Qi saw her, he pretended to be full of smiles, welcoming her. He was persuading Tom to go to the north with him, but Tom refused. He knew it must be because of Yidi, he thought he must find a way to deal with this situation. It might cost a few dollars, but if he could give his son a lesson and make him understand what the purpose of a woman like Yidi is, then it would not be too much to spend one hundred thousand or eighty thousand dollars. He calculated in his heart, made a decision, and said to Yidi, "Has Tom taken you to see this place around?" Yidi said, "No." Pan Qi said, "Okay, since I can't separate the two of you, you can take your things, and I'll take you to see." Yidi agreed, saying, "Great," and walked out with Pan Qi and Tom.
