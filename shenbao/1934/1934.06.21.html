<p>時評</p>
<h3>復興農村與農村放欵</h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>今日農村窮乏。已遍及全國。任何豐足省分。除極少數特殊區域外。莫不痛感此種窮乏情勢。足以引起整個農村經濟之破産。農村經濟破産。則全國國民經濟。决無倖存之理。目前以農村衰敗之故。巳陷全國市面於頽廢之中。同時大都市畸形發展。農村現金。羣趨都市。而入於睡眠狀態。卽以國人所經營。之銀行讑。所有存欵。總數將近二十萬萬。而放出之欵。恐尚不及百分之五十其餘皆成遊資。長此以往。在銀行方面。將更難於處置。農村方面。則愈　而不可收拾矣。</p>
<p>此種景象之成。其初源於内地社會秩序之不安。在農業經濟轉化爲工業經濟之過程中。農村遭受困苦。勢所必然。况資本主義先進諸國。受世界經濟恐慌之激盪。以農業國爲消售製造品之市塲。繼復進一步而傾消其農業産品。近年來外國小麥　粉及榖米。輸入我國。巨　增加。卽其明證。以故豐收之年。乃竟釀成榖價低賤之恐慌。如陜西歷年荒旱。人民多流離失所。一朝豐收。仍苦無以自活。是卽證明我國農村經濟。實受市塲關係之逼迫。而陷於困境矣。再則農村富力之積蓄。必以有力之副業爲主。如絲茶等是。近今工業製造品。旣源源輸入内地。農村自給自足之理想經濟。早巳打破。一般日常生活必需品。在鄕村除食料外。又多仰給於輸入。而農業副産品。復不能與輸入品。求得適當之平衡。農村之富力。乃日見消减。都市之繁榮。亦難於保持。而經濟危機遂日益加甚。</p>
<p>於是上海及其他大都市現有之遊資。擬以農村放欵形式。令其還流於鄕村。冀農村得均潤之惠。都市不致受過飽之危。意固甚善。惟此種放欵。如若地域不廣。數目不多。則收回自易。銀行亦感其利。但吾人須知今日我國農民之借欵。多用於暫濟當前之急。藉以敷衍現狀。並非作土地改良。或爲其他生産事業之資。則此種借欵。於農村本身之眞正利益。依然有限。於整個國民經濟之危機。亦無補於毫末。而於銀行資本之利濟。爲時更極暫也。緣此種辦法。農民於舉　還債之外。自身尙須另籌如何償付利息。果能輕利借貸。自爲　民所歡迎。或亦可稱解一時之急難。然而尙未足以言復興農村也。</p>
<p>當此世界各國高　非常時期之際。　　國家如我國者。　　受經濟　　重大損害。故今日對農村放欵。第一須注意整個農村之開發。其大者應由中央政府與地方政府决定具體方針。以有計劃方法。穏定此非常時期。先求一般社會秩序之安定。同時指示都市與農村合作之途徑。然後信用合作之效。乃得顯著。資金之運用。乃能得宜。農村粗安後。卽須從事於土地之改良。與農村敎育之普及。第二須注意農村一般消費力。如不能積極增加。則都市工業。萬難發達。國民經濟。更無基礎。故今日而言復興農村。無論如何着手。要須以農村工業化爲前提。換言之卽使農村副業重興。積極爲農村增加生産是也。然驟欲在農村企圖建設機械工業。事實殆不可能。故家庭手工業之提倡。與輕便工業之敎育。爲農村經濟回復之初基。是以農村放欵。一方面須促成土地之改良。另一方面則須誘發農人從事於家庭手工業生産之興趣。然後遊資可眞正流回農村。復興之實。亦乃得而可見也。</p>

<h3>海軍問題　美日意見衝突　日本要求平等别有用心　麥唐納與松平會見内容</h3>
<p>（紐約）美國海軍提督普拉德今日在國際時事雜誌發表一文、攻擊日本要求海軍軍備平等、普氏以爲日本之國家安全、並不需要與英美海軍之平等力量、因日本巳有安全之防禦綫、而英國無之、至於美國、則有太平洋及大西洋之防綫、日本祇須對付一方、亦不必與美國平等、且過去五十年中、英美兩國均無與日本對敵之表示、故普氏以爲日本之要求、旣非爲和平起見、则必有其他深意存焉云云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）並拉脫續稱、倫敦條約規定潛水艇噸位之平等、不僅使日本各島　於磐石之固、且使日本由島國而步入亞洲大陸、如探　取物之易、時至今日、無有能封鎖日本海岸者、日本海軍費高於全部得政費、美國情形適得其反自一九二二年華盛頓會議以來、日本海軍預算、高出美國五倍又半、並拉脫以爲美日苟不實行商戰、而能彼此尊重條約權利義務、則美日實無衝突之理由云、至於滿洲問題、普拉脫認日本有相當權利云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）普拉特提督發表其個人對於變更日本海軍現行比率之見解、日本海軍當局對此述其意向如下、（一）普拉特提督謂日本政府對於英美兩國並無主張更改現行海軍比率而要求提高之理論根據、但華府條約乃爲十五年以前所訂者、現今國際情形迭經變化、武器亦經進步、而日本國勢之躍進、諸如是類之原因、均認爲有更改之必要、且倫敦條約亦屬短期、故贊成在下屆軍縮會議、主張以自由立塲而圖完全更新、早經聲明在案、（二）日本雖未若美國接近於太平洋大西洋、然美國艦隊倘集中全力於太平洋、則應付該項情形之海軍實力、認爲有絶對之必要、（三）倘一旦戰爭勃發、日本固爲中立國、而與英美無異、但滿洲建國爲日尚淺、且訂有日滿議定書、故中立國之責任亦極形重大、（四）如以爲日本之財政難耐造艦竸爭、此種觀察當屬錯誤、爲充實軍備而選擇適宜於國威國情之兵艦種類亦屬可能、在軍縮條約廢棄以後之財政、當較之現在頗情寛裕、卽在國民對於軍備上之心境觀之、則該提督之觀察亦屬錯誤也云云、（二十日日聯電）</p>
<h3>英美海軍續談</h3>

<h3>法國經濟最近現狀　（巴黎通信）　現金增加失業繼長　經濟節縮豫算均衡</h3>
<p>法國這幾年來、在國際間　處境甚難、自德國提出軍　平等要求之後、當局諸人更感不安　深恐德人一旦持其近代科學化武器、運用其軍國主義的組織以與法國挑　、則勝敗之數難料　因此、法國一面仍竭力與英國週旋　、務使將來的軍縮會議、不致完全破裂、另一方面又拉攏蘇聯、使德國少一個有力的與國、假使蘇聯可以加入國聯、則瀕於危殆的國聯生命又可　續若干時日、但是法人尙認爲不够單靠外交上的縱横、還不足以穏定她在歐洲的霸權因此她十分注意於自己經濟上的領導地位、</p>
<p>所謂經濟的領導者、無他就是法蘭西金本位制度的鞏固、與現金凖備的健實、法國不肯停止金本位制其在内的原因、是戰時受過了通貨膨脹的嚴勵敎訓、外來的原國、是要保持她在歐洲金融界的霸者地位，但又惹起另一種不良現象、卽國際匯兌低落國家的商品、爲價格較低關係、羣向法境流入、法國自己的産業和農業、都受着威脅、所以她要起來設法保護、保護的方法、不消說就是强化限額制度、努力使入超額至於最少限度、結果輸入超過的、確是减少了、而與法國有貿易關係的各國、對法商品、也行使同樣的報復主義、於是法國商品輸出亦日漸减少起來　去年四月法國對外輸出爲十五萬零一百萬法郎、今年同時期則减至十四萬七千萬法郎了、輸入去年四月爲二十四萬、　千七百萬法郎、今年同時期就减到二十萬零　千五百萬法郎、如果由本年一月起到四月止、計算起來、與去年最初四個月的累計相比較輸入减少了十五萬四千七百萬法郎輸出减少了五千七百萬法郎這在輸入方面講、可以說是改善了、但尙不是積極的辦法</p>
<p>我們檢查法國工業的生産指數、就能明白這種的改善輸入於經濟界没有什麽益處、現在以一九一三年爲基凖、法國工業生産總指數今年一二月各爲一零六三月却跌到一零五、　　工業·鑛山·建築·皮革·等等、都是向下低落、這在英美德各國的工業生産指數向上增長的時候法國獨趨下遊、這是何等的不景氣、</p>
<p>法國因爲工業不振、所以失業人數、亦向上增加、去年九月間法國在歐洲各大國間除　聯外）、爲失業工人最少的國家在同月月底、祇有二十六萬七千人到去年年底、却增加到三十一萬二千人、今年三月中旬、更增加到三十四萬九千人四月又略有增加、至三十五萬人、比去年同時期增加了三萬人、形勢雖不　　　　足以證　法國經濟情况的惡化</p>
<p>政府方面在本年二月初間豫算成立的時候推　收入的不足、约有四十萬萬法郎但因財政信用增大的結果、再加四月間的節約令、節省了政費、於是三月間的國庫收入就相對的增加起來如果這種傾向能够繼續下去、則本年度財政豫算可以得到平衡、也未可知、</p>
<p>因爲法國的財政信用增大、所以流出去的資金又流回來、儲　着的現金又漸次出現於市面、法　西銀行的現金保有額數、遂漸次增加、本年三月祇有七三九　八百萬法郎那　法國的金本位幾乎要不能維持、到四月中旬增加到七四·九七八百萬法郎、五月初增加到七六·一七七百萬法郎單就現金狀况論却是漸可穏定、但須視德國及其他各金本位國的情形、纔能判斷法國是否可以長遠支持金本位和現時優越地位（五月十日於巴黎）</p>

<h3>怎樣學寫書信文（續）</h3>
<p>舊的尺牘不適合今日之用巳於昨日討論過了。今日略陳怎樣學寫我們所需要的書售文，以答蔣子玉君。編者</p>
<p>上面巳經說過，舊型的書牘巳隨士大夫輩的没落而没落了。一種新的社會關係，自有與之相適應的一種新的社交，書信是人與人間的一種交通，不過以筆代言罷了。在封建的身份存在的當日，那種爛調，套話自然是需要的，現在當我們這樣繁雜的社會生活裏，也自然另需要一套，新的代言的工具，這一點也不足爲怪。</p>
<p>現在來談我們所需要的書信文是什麽。</p>
<p>第一，因爲中國早巳是民國了。人與人間在「法律」上是一律平等的，封建的身份早廢止了。所以在書信中就没有再採用　避直接稱謂而代用什麽「閣下，侍席，文几，足下左右」等套語之理。對「父親」就直呼「父親」，或「爸爸」爲是，這旣恭敬，也更親密，「大人，膝下，敬禀者」都可省去。寫信給國府主席，卽直呼林主席爲最得體，不要再累累贅贅灣灣曲曲寫上一大套，因爲主席雖是一國元首，郤是人民的公僕，有事要責備他，自然應該誠誠懇懇的對他說，何用忌諱什麽要歸到他的「左右」去。以前稱謂常常閙出大笑話就是因爲太灣曲了的緣故。並且一封信的稱呼是很關緊要的，如果是情書若用一句套話反變得無生氣了。現在的靑年的書牘中常常看見有用「親愛的」，「我的天使」，「乖乖」，┆┆等等，這些東西雖然同樣是將稱呼拉長，郤反變得更生動，更需要了，因爲愛人的相見原來用的是這套密語，書信中如果換上另一種稱呼，不獨對方看了會生出誤會、以爲愛情發生變化了，就是寫信的人，也以不寫出這些密語，情不能自己的。所以稱呼在今日是以「自然」爲原則，不要勉强，定要寫成什麽「賢内助」「夫君」這些無生氣的冷字。以此類推，朋友間可稱某兄，某先生，或直呼其名爲最適宜。餘仿此，不贅。</p>
<p>第二，切忌閑話。舊式書牘在稱呼後一定要接上叙「思慕」，「時令」等閑話。這些東西完全是虚僞，在古人中，有學問的人己不多有。這祇是文牘師爺玩的手法。毫無意義可說。我們今日的書信。一開始就要「言婦正傳」。有話馬上就說，不要要說不說，使看的人白費時光，寫的人多費紙筆。没有話說，就可不寫信，一張紙寫不滿，寫兩行就兩行，不必要畫滿全張，方稱合格。至於文人通信，愛人談情，你要怎樣說。普怎樣說，隨心所欲，不必顧到文體以及其他的世界，因爲在今日的習慣，私　人信件是不許擅開的，祇要雙方有時間，有心緖，儘可無忌憚的言所欲言，無有不可。</p>
<p>第三，切忌敷衍及朦混不明的用語。譬如你一個朋友病了，你不應再用「吉人天相，喜占勿藥」等敷衍語，你反應告訴他：「請好醫生」，「進醫院」，「不可大意」。這纔表示你的友誼。收信的人看了也多一個主張，於病者方爲有益。以外，如别人的父母病死了，你不應套用什麽「福備生前，笑含泉下」的用語去慰唁他的家屬，你有感卽依你的所感慨嘆幾句，不然就不必多說，因爲這種敷衍的應酬，不僅在文言中太多，就是白話中，如果瞎用，也會成爲爛調，這不獨令人看了生厭，有時反傷朋友的心，何苦呢？</p>
<p>第四，信體雖貴自由書寫，但一定要段落明晰，語有倫次。這就是說，要分段，每一意思另成一段，不可在一段中含有幾項意思。這本來是修辭的一種規則，不是書信文所獨有。但書信文尤宜如此。因爲今日社會生活的繁複，事業方面的人，每日收信十件至百件以上的並不稀奇，如果寫得模糊不淸，會整天用來讀信還不够呢。這一點，應該特别注意。</p>
<p>第五，中國人對於寫信有一個大毛病，尤其在昔日如此，就是没有時間的觀念，常常把日子不寫。這一點雖然與信體文似無關係，其實是不然的。書信最重要的是與時間的關係？尤其是在舒情的及事務的方面的書信文是如此。事務方面有時因爲時間上的差錯，可以誤人大事，舒情方面的則因時過境遷，眞情不能於適當的時間宣達了。我們應該注意時間上的觀念。</p>
<p>總之：以上不過略提學寫書信的幾個要點罷了。這種文體，現在國語文學中巳成了一種很好的收穫。可以作爲參考的甚多。如亞東之「白話書信」，光華之「現代名人信」，南强之（實用白話書信），高光之（周作人書信）及其他</p>
<p>信體小說，均可一讀。但我們並不主張把這些東西作範本。因爲人的談话本來是没有一定的規範的，書信係筆談，如何要學鸚鵡似的學人說舌呢？學書信最好的方法是多與人通信，這一方面自巳練習了，同時又可從來信中學習一點自己没有的經騐。學習寫信也如學習游泳一樣，學習游泳要到水中去，不是讀游泳指南就够了的。這一點意思，諒蔣君可能領悟罷！</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>讀者試想：整整的一輛火車上，所載的衣服，　祇是備供太后在衣短短的某一個季節中所服用的，那末内廷裏的御衣庫，它的規模該是怎樣的偉大？内容該是怎樣的充實？作者特地再重複的點醒一句！</p>
<p>太后的龍衣旣是如許的多，每一襲新的，平均穿不到幾天便擱下了，這樣看來，伊的衣服都可以永遠留爲紀念的了。可是這些衣服都有一個注定的命運，除了伊所賜給我的一小部份之外，凡爲伊所有的，待到伊一旦駕崩之後，就得悉數的葬入伊的墳墓中去！眞的，後來伊一死，那無量數的衣服，竟不問美醜，一概埋在地下了。這種習慣，倒不是皇帝家所特創的；大凡崇奉佛敎的中國人，都要這樣做的。他們相信一個死了之後，還得穿衣服，倘不如此，死人的魂靈便只能裸體了。可是也有一個例外，就是凡有皮的衣服，不論出鋒的，或全部襯皮的，都是决不葬下去的；因爲有一個傳說，如果這個人死了之後，他的家屬替他把皮衣服葬進了墳墓中去，。他就會墮入畜生道；當然，做子孫的也决不願意讓死了的人變銀鼠，變灰鼠，變狐狸，變紫貂。於是，皮衣服竟得獨免於難了！</p>
<p>（九）御膳房</p>
<p>太后這一次出去，「衣，」「住，」「行」三者，可算是巳經圓滿解决了。還有那個最緊要的問題丨食的問題，又是怎樣呢？在宮中，當然是盡量的富麗，盡量的考究：但是在火車上，却不得不待虧伊一些了！第一個原因，就是地位不够。然而就是這樣，我們的這一列御用火車上，已有整整的四輛車子是專給太后充作臨時的御膳房了。（六三）</p>
<h3>老郎菩薩</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>劇塲後台有土偶，貌白晳，披黃袍，伶人禮之甚虔，號老郎菩薩。按之李笠翁十種曲比目魚傳奇入班齣云：</p>
<p>凡有一敎，就有一敎的宗主，</p>
<p>二郎神是我做戲的宗主，就像儒家的孔夫子，釋家的如來佛，道家的李老君。我們這位老師，極是靈顯，又極是操切，不像儒釋道的敎主都有涵養，不記人的小過，凡是同班裏面，有些暗昧不明之事，他就會覺察出來，大則降災福：小則生病生凔，你們都要緊記在心，切不可犯他的忌。</p>
<p>則其神爲二郎神，二字與老字相近，或沿譌也。惟封神演義之灌口二郎神，與戲劇無關。故紀曉嵐以爲「伶人所祀爲唐明皇，以梨園子弟也」。然安次香以爲「乃後唐莊宗，非明皇也」。蓋以歐陽修五代史有伶官傳　，而莊宗爲貴族搬演戲劇之始，祀之殊宜。楊掌手京塵雜錄云：「老郎神姓耿，名夢。昔諸童子從敎師學歌舞，每見一小郎，極秀慧，爲諸郎痄，固非同學中人也。每肄業時必至，或集諸郎按名索之，則無其人。諸郎旣與之習，樂與游，見之則智慧頓生，由是相驚以神，復乃肖像祀之」。</p>
<p>此說頗不經，掌生亦不甚置信。惟言吳人晨起禁言夢，諸伶尤甚，以爲諱其神名。又言廣州城歸德門内魁巷梨園會館，稱老郎廟，有碑載老郎神事甚悉，不知今日尙在否？碑文於老郎之姓氏里居有確當之記述否？甚望粵人有以證之也。</p>
<h3>捕蛇者</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>據捕蛇的說：「蛇類中要以琵琶蛇最毒，它是由龜蛻化而成。」對門王家在前數年豢養了一隻大龜，一天突然的失蹤了，遍覔不得，那裏知道這隻鳥龜爬在陰溝洞被石隙軋住了，爬，好久，竟脫殻而去，却成了一尾毒虺氣候悶濕的時候，它老在嘘氣，人們受到了它嘘的毒氛，就覺身體不舒，生起病來，正好似綠氣砲一般的厲害。</p>
<p>捕蛇的它上身赤裸了，下體穿了藍布短袴，把藥草用口津拌匀了，塗在手上，臂上，裸的地方，打着引蛇的口哨，一忽兒一尾毒虺巳入了它的靑布　中，問主人要了三十塊錢，它又走到第二家去捕蛇了。所帶的蛇噬草藥，二角小洋一寸，頃刻巳賣去了一大半，它弄錢的藝術不壞！</p>
<p>我想中國社會上，地幅是很大的，但是毒蛇也很多，尤其是東北三省出了一尾比那毒得狠的琵琶蛇更毒，不知有没有一個本領高强的捕蛇者，替民衆替國家除害。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三十回　　目送哀鴻埋頭守國土彈穿勁臂　血染孤城</p>
<p>他說到這裏，雖然是在黑夜裏，知道弟兄們看不到他的顔色，他也帶了一副淡笑的樣子，接着道：這回讓他試试罷，呌他一個也回去不了？你們明白了没有？這一連弟兄受了殷得仁的訓練多年，他們知道殷連說話作事，都要澈底，不能糢糊的，於是齊齊的答應一聲明白了。殷得仁再也没有别的話說，喊着向右轉，向前開步走，自己在一邊督率着，帶領了一連弟兄就出了堡門。到了第一道戰壕，喊着疏開的口令，弟兄們各背了槍彈，陸續的下到壕溝裏面去。殷得仁下得壕來，昻頭看看天上，層層疊疊的星點，在凄凉的寒空裏，略微有些摇動，似乎被寒風所吹，都有些瘦小了。他帶着手套的，抬起手來，摸摸自己的臉，覺得那粗綫的组織物在臉皮上摸着，只咸到麻木不仁，臉皮巳是凍得不知痛養了。本想將手套除下，用手來磨擦取暖，然而轉念一想，弟兄們兩隻手套除下，用手那個的臉上，又該不冷。若是他們也學樣在臉上摩擦起來，都把槍放下，不用打仗了。於是自己把一切寒冷都忍受了，靜靜的坐在戰壕裏，只等敵人來到，便迎上前去。但是耳邊所聽到的，只是一些風吹積雪聲，瑟瑟作　。抬頭四望，那沉沉的夜色，乘着四週的星象，却與大地相接，人就是在黑洞洞的中間呆定着。在宇宙的中間，好像是一切都死了，便是殷得仁自身，也感覺這顆心也是死去了一樣。在那萬分無聊的當中，於是伸着手到口袋裏去，很有些想抽烟捲的意思，但是手上所接觸的，不是烟捲盒乃是火柴盒。（四一四）</p>
<h3>亂世鴛鴦之我見</h3>
<p>— 可兒</p>
<p>永安樂社彩排「亂世鴛鴦」於卡爾登，記者七時蒞塲，得窺全豹。該社人材濟濟，殊令人不能巳於言也。</p>
<p>劇中主人公凌霄，唱做打武，處處吃重，非藝術淵博如郭琳爽君，　不能勝任，是晚郭君於觀書一塲，唱梵音，跌蕩抑揚，有谏果回甘之妙。送别以大笛襯做工，一舉手，一投足，均有分寸，行刺被擒時之强項不屈，五姨戲弄時之忍辱見禨，曲曲傳來，有聲有色。及後扮野人打猩猩一塲，幾下撲跌工夫，頗見别緻。名小武東生之後，僅見此君，票友中無出其右者矣。鄭倩如女士去白珍珠，聲色藝俱佳，一段駡玉郎，有嚼蕊吹香之致，灌藥時體貼入微，天眞嫵媚，可造材也。鄭鎏君之珊瑚，扮相特美，眉目如畫中人，動作妙曼輕盈，嬌態可掬。戲弄凌霄一塲，說白流利，目語眉言，　情劇巳臻極峯，惜塲口不多，令人有斯人不出之感。麥友雲君之羅君鐵嗓虎威，去沙王神態畢肖。唐鎭秩君之白淸風表情持重，唱做到家，其他如林澄泰劉生初二君之農家夫婦，梁毅民君之船夫，蘇慧瑛程玉堅二女士之小環，或以詼諧見長，或以唱做見勝特丹綠葉，相得　彰。飽飫眼福之餘，執筆記之如上。</p>

<h3>蒔花小記</h3>
<p>— 心仁</p>
<p>在上海要自己種一點花很難。因爲鴿　似的住宅區裏要找一片空隊眞是不易，假如找一到了隙地找不到泥土也還是徒然。但是上海的公園又是這樣少，住在廂樓裏找來找去都找不到一點自然的氣息，窗外是水泥的房屋，水泥的牆，烟黑的天空裏横着一條一條火赤的瓦　，没有一枝綠葉，聽不到一聲鳥呌，這日子是多麽枯澀呵·那麽自己栽一點花吧，是的，祇好自己栽一點花補救這個缺陷了從先施公司買了幾包花子，花式自然是揀自已最歡喜的，跑回來想立刻就種，那知多方的困　竟阻攔着，找　地，找爛泥，種種問題匯集了來，一時得不到解决。隙地，上海地坡貴，誰會給你劉下一片種花的地方？泥土吧，近處祇有垃圾堆，泥土於是包含着破銅爛　　皮　　！不純粹還是小事，並且臭得厲害。但是種花巳經成爲一種　　自然的衝動，不把這幾包花子種下心裏　好像擔着什麽心事。於是昨祇好下了一個决心，把地點選在晒臺上，泥土是跑到火車路旁邊堀來的，用報紙包了，帶到家裏，土質雖然還好，然而仍然不大純粹，小玻璃，洋鐵皮常會刺着手指痛。自然土是不能太濕，播了　、上面覆　薄薄的一層土，又不能太緊，緊了小　就難得透出的。</p>
<p>足足費了兩點鐘的工夫，方才把一切播種的事情做完，回到房間裏再看花子袋上的花樣，心裏眞說不出的欣悅，我想：從此以後，每天又鑫了一點忙啦。今天一早，走到晒　上去洒了一次的水，細細的看了一會，心裏又想：多早蚖這裏邊就會跳出兩　小芽呢？</p>
<h3>月季</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>花　四時，月一披秀，此宋祁贊月季花之語也。月季爲常綠灌木，與薔薇同，或有謂爲薔薇之變　者，莖蔓生有刺，花按月開放，故名。俗稱月月紅，羣芳譜云：「月季花，一名勝春，一名瘦客，又名鬥雪紅，有紅白及淡紅三色。」</p>
<p>語云：弄花一年，看花十日。蓋花之護養綦難，而蓓蕾之時又殊暫也，。然若植月季一株，芳菲不斷，耐人久賞，足以彌此　憾，亦可作盆玩，然盆玩者，一花再花而巳，不能次第續放，土力有限，使之然也。</p>
<p>昔蘇子瞻有月季花再生詩：「幽花本長春，暫瘁如蝕月。」比喻绝妙，又楊萬里云：「一尖巳　胭脂筆，四破猶包翡翠茸。」狀花之形態亦殊佳肖，又有句云：「閏年開到十三回」。</p>
<p>則不憶何人所作矣。</p>
<p>眠雲心漢閣筆記，有月季谱一則，爰採之以爲資料：「月季一花，千態百色，江右王天裔者，風雅士也，覓得月季有百數十種，皆佳品，稍次者尙不在此數，有妾揚州人，善藝植，蓋産自園藝家，天裔游江都時，知其尤善插月季，遂以重金納爲　室。後天裔著月季譜，未就而卒，友人有張君者，頗好事，亦愛是花，本與天裔最相契合，願就其妾，講求花品，及接插諸法，爲續成花譜，妾亦願之，未及浹旬，戚黨中有以　語者，張君歎曰：此風雅事，而乃被污濁名乎，天裔名節我辱之，非友也，遂絶跡不至王氏，妾未通翰墨，乃中輟，聞者咸</p>
<p>咸致惜焉，此淸光緖中葉事，妾無所出，妻有一子，聞今家道中落，巳改業爲花匠矣，大約猶妾之傳　也。」</p>

<h3>中小學文言運動（三）</h3>
<p>— 汪懋祖</p>
<p>（六）吳先生謂初中國文敎材、並不枯瘠、歷與「蔣委員長、中央黨部、黨國元老之演說辭、宣傳文、或論文、凡雜誌報章所爭傳的、不少語體文的作品、）無不可以作爲敎材、誠然、不　主中學時、每見上項文章、立卽選付印刷、分發講授、如蔣委員長告全國學生書等、傳誦全校、惟論文偏於專門、學生不易瞭解、宣傳辭過於冗長、可閱覽而不便精讀、至如精警之作、如汪精衛先生　晨課圖、革命的勇氣及執信的人格諸作、皆當選爲敎材、但此项文字甚少、而初中三年、每週以兩篇爲率、一年至少八十篇、並須顧及文體結構、而關於民族精神、倫理美感、智理、體育、政治、社交多方興趣、皆須顧及、若按照部頒課　標凖而向雜誌報章選擇材料、恐富有敎學經騐者亦歎其窮乏、而一年級敎材尤甚　　近稍翻閱初中國文敎本、其在一二年級尤爲複雜、有翻譯之文、有冗長佶屈之作、而水滸景陽崗一節幾無不選入、此文描寫武松打虎栩栩如生、以文藝論、固自可喜、但其中有一句」我却怕甚麽鳥？敎師講至此語、敢問如何表出？不侫自欺頭腦陳腐、則退一步言、就令有女生在前亦可無所避忌、惟國語敎學除技術之外、尙含有修養及提高語言之作用、必須注意、而此篇乃普遍精習、幾視爲國文之寳典、此吾所　窮且濫也、（七）吳先生謂高小「如參敎之手也者」的叙事說理等文實在「治絲益禁」「徒亂人意」珵所謂高小文言當如歐陽修養魚記、薛福成觀巴黎油盡記之類、多選抒情記叙淸淺有味之文、並非周誥殷盤佶屈警牙之文、其實以文而論、此類文字、巳是白話、不過腔調不同、若吳先生能承認此點、則彼此意見、無甚出入、又何事爭辯耶、</p>
<p>吳先生恐「之乎者也」縀　、以致治絲益棼一、不知「嗎底呀呐啊呢的」是否更增敎學之困難、倘初中全敎文言斋　以语體文爲課外讀物、（初中課程應如何修訂使之簡單化、見拙著中學制度之檢討與改進、此處不詳述）則三年以内、卽天資稍鈍者、余敢必其淸通、今因白话敎材多於文言诚如吳先生所謂「四不象」工具不能運用、又安能稍窺较深之文籍、前年中政校招生、國文試題有下列一段文字、試加標點并譯成語體、</p>
<p>高帝創業、目不睱給、孝　享國又淺┆┆多數試卷標點爲</p>
<p>高帝創業曰、「不睱給孝」享國又淺惠、┆┆</p>
<p>高帝創業曰、「不睱給孝惠」、享國又淺┆┆</p>
<p>凡此皆有事實可證、非「嚮壁虚造」也、</p>
<p>（八）吳先生徵引科舉時代江陰考生千人中通者不過百人、其例恐非盡確、蓋科舉之文、無論八股或策論、皆有一種體制、另成一種技術又限於定額不取者非可目爲不通儘有文才卓　而一生不第者、故不足以爲倒也、學習文言固較潯常語言稍難、但其努力之程度决不如吳先生所言之甚、而應用上之省力、則閱者作者以及印工皆較經濟、若用耳不用目、固無須文言、若須用目則文言尙矣、因文言爲語體之縮寫、語言注重音義、而文言音義之外、尙有形可察、例如說「這一個學生或是那一個學生」、文言只須「此生或彼生」卽巳明瞭、其省力爲何如、此僅就工具言之、巳無待辯論矧猶有先民精神所寄、必欲如掃落葉、則不侫宣力敎育、斷不敢和雷同、</p>
<p>要之文字之　落、如無關於民族之墮落不侫何必斷斷焉、今日國事萬端、敎育問題亦萬端、賢者識其大者、不賢者識其小者、余識其小者而已、又以素性率直、一時興會所至、恐不免開罪他人、惟吳先生與敎部諸公、諒其苦心、是非得失、付諸公論從此勿復置辩矣、（完）</p>
<h3>讀汪文「中小學文言運動」後的聲明</h3>
<p>— 吳研因</p>
<p>報所載汪典存先生的中小學文言運動一文前半篇論點很　捉摸、後半籍也並未駁倒我的小學不必敎文言、語體文本身不能斥爲破壞思想等主張、所以我不想再發言了，但是有幾點不能不說明的、</p>
<p>（一）外國人對於中國文化、正如中國人對於自己的文化一樣、有許多人崇拜中國的古董、同時也有許多人以中國的古董爲非、以文字論、杜威、孟祿就說中國的文字太難學、應當改造、國聯敎育考察團也建議中國的文字應當研究改良、同時還有一班别有心肝的外國人、一味迎合或放任舊社會、所以也往往鼓勵中國人讀經　孔、並且尊重中國的學究先生（香港就是如此）、在他們看來、保存中國的「國粹」、正和保存中國的迷信、鴉片烟、小脚┆┆一樣　、我們實不可引以爲榮、汪先生引國哈佛大學敎授的主張、自然又和這班别有心肝的人不可同日而語、</p>
<p>（二）我們固然不能「以人廢言」袁世凱張勳張宗昌之徒、人雖可鄙、言或可稱、但敎育新興的時候、一班明達的讀書人（？）主張開辦學堂、而不識字的賣　傭、却偏擁護「四書五經」三字經千字文也在他們擁護之列、斥學堂爲洋學堂、　臂怒目、欲得之而甘心、其心固未可厚非、其愚實深可憐憫、况目袁張之徒、提倡尊孔讀經、原與他們的「帝制」「復辟」等目的、有連帶的作用、不特其愚己甚、其心實尤可誅、</p>
<p>（三）何鍵陳濟棠輩、雖曾提倡尊孔、確未强令學校讀經、要是不信、請通函到湖南廣東去問一問便知、再不然看看敎育部的視察湖南敎育報告和粤敎廳覆敎育部的呈文、也可以證明此說、</p>
<p>（四）提倡小學用語體文、發端於北京敎育部、禁止小學用文言文、令出自前大學院、申令小學不得用文言文　、以加重學生負担、是敎育部最近的公文、實與劉大白先生無涉、鄙人（馬前小卒）更無能爲力、汪先生以爲部令應服從、請勿因劉先生和鄙人之故而就表示不服、</p>
<p>（五）小學國语敎科書、編輯不能盡善、取材不能盡當、無庸諱言但論用字、我們終身鮮用貓字、而貓字却爲中外敎科書所通有、形容聲音的嘓嘰等字、當然最好不用、但在兒童字　中、如無他字可代、爲行文之故、實出不妨偶一用之、至松鼠換衣的故事、旣有辨色和配色的自然目的、當然不必再顧其他、因爲小學敎材的目的、往往單純　並不複雜的、况且摭拾一二字或一二課課文爲今敎科書全體病、這也不是我們所應取的　度、</p>
<p>（六）職業界主張文言、這是　於舊習的緣故、我們不能因我們的母親主張替孫女　小脚而便犠牲自己的女兒、也不能因多數老百姓主張應有「眞命天子」出世而便歡迎溥儀回　、或請袁世凱復活、因爲舊社會歡迎私塾主張文言的緣故、而便自認爲新敎育失敗、這正似因爲有人希望皇帝登極而便自認爲共和失敗一樣、</p>
<p>我巳說過汪先生的主張並不極端、而命題措辭却好像是一個極端派、希望汪先生如再發議論時、请先自認定立塲、再看淸對方的論點、然後立言、否則枝枝節節、打了一百年的筆墨官司、打到老死、恐怕也會不明白自己到底是爲著甚麽一回事的、</p>
<p>最後聲明、這只是一個說明、不是甚麽辯論、願與汪先生付之一笑、</p>

<h3>紗花　標紗花漲勢較弱</h3>
<p>紗市仍堅、因美棉趨漲、實需華北一路、購辦尙不間斷、兼之三品紗價軋空飛漲、引起投機者活動、於是市面愈昂、但本月份交貨有一部份棉紗尙在審查中、午後有獲利多頭了結、市價稍鬆云、</p>

<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>頂眞些好</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>有人　笑話，說明明有國貨不買，而反買外國貨大約這個人常住在冰室中，把心冰冷了嗎？旁邊還有人說：現在已交夏令，天氣熱了，愛用國貨的心，也該熱起來了，其實生爲中國人，應用中國貨，無論天怎樣熱固然要用國貨，卽使天怎樣冷，也該用國貨。春天，夏天，秋天，冬天，一年四季，無時無刻不該不用中國貨。夏天一至，菜館裏請客起來，侍役最得意的手段，是拚命的傾銷汽水，啤酒，橘子水。朋友們，飲固然飲好了，可是要看看牌子，不要討好了嘴，馬馬虎瑛的飲了仇貨或外國貨，把成千成萬的金錢，在這夏令中流入外人的錢袋裏。吾最佩服的一位朋友，前天在宴會中，侍役送了幾瓶啤酒幾瓶汽水，正要傾到杯裏，吾的朋友說，且慢，吾來看看看，那知不看則巳，一看都是外國貨，吾的朋友呌侍役去掉換國貨來，侍役說巳用完了，吾的朋友說：用完再去買來，否則惟有不用。侍役只好到國貨公司裏拿了幾瓶國貨啤酒，國貨汽水，橘子水，大家纔是安心。這種嚴正不苟的地方，吾們很表同情。希望大家都要這樣去對付這種壞坯子的堂倌侍役。吾們尤其要佩服兩個軍人，一個是韓復榘，他最近在山東通令全省，如果有人以外國品，冒充國貨，除封閉商店外，並加倍罰金，這種嚴厲的辦法，好像炎炎夏日，很是痛快。一個是魯滌平，聽說他家裏的用品，都已一槪服用國貨，最近辦貨人替他買了許多夏令用品，他發現有一件仇貨，二件外國貨，他大大發怒，把這種非國貨勒令退回，並手諭國貨商店，以後不得再贩賣外國貨，否則要治以欺罔之罪。這種乾脆的辦法，也似炎炎夏日，使人稱快。本刋趁這夏令時候，特出夏令用品專號，把許多國貨，介紹於讀者之前，希望一致注意服用，同時希望國貨廠商注意改進，然後生産者消費者兩得其利，這便是區區刋行的旨趣。倘使大家贊成的話，還可以作第二次的刋行。</p>
<h3>夏令的模範家庭</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>做模範家庭難，做夏令的模範家庭更難，可是經濟家王先生與敎育家高女士的家庭，却是在夏令中更覺得可以爲人模範，可以爲提倡國貨的做模範。他們的家庭，布置得很簡單，很樸素，明窗凈几之下，張着薄薄的窗簾，是三友社的綠色自由布，又輕又軟，上面裝的是華生電風扇，輕風陣陣，沁人肌　，書房裏幾架小的摇頭風扇，也是華生出品。吾們去拜訪他一對賢伉儷時，他們正在並肩看書，身上都是穿的五和廠的鵝牌汗衫，又白又軟，一對璧人，尤顯出是神仙眷屬，風雅絶倫。高女士說我倆最討厭的是夏天赤膊，旣不衛生，又不雅觀，所以家裏的小孩子，都是替他們穿上一套汗衫汗褲，前天帶他們到五和購物，買了汗衫以外，又得到幾隻賽璐珞的白鵝，小孩子更是快活，小孩子今天又要求我們去替他們買汗衫了。大家笑了一回，高女士請我們飲屈臣氏汽水，又到後花園去納凉，高女士說：這兒樹木花草雖多，可是晚上蚊蟲，最是猖獗，三星蚊烟香，很有效騐，所以我家一交夏令，三星蚊烟香是必備之物。末了又談及草帽問題，高女士說，王先生的草帽，是華福出品，他戴了以後，許多朋友稱贊不置，所以我們最近購了一打，在端節一天分贈親友，覺得比任何禮物，來得實際。這種辦法，尤其値得紀載，我們話别以後，覺得這樣的夫婦，這樣的家庭，眞是値得景仰的了。</p>
<h3>怎樣購置夏令用品</h3>
<p>— 張彰</p>
<p>讀者諸君，時候過得好快，年年的夏天，現在又光臨到我們的目前了，在夏天裏，我們的生活，除了一般的，平凡的像平日一樣的過去以外。更有一個値得討論的問題，横擺在我們的目前，需要我們去研究，需要我們去解决，假如這個問題，我們不去研究，不去謀解决的方法，那末，不但與整個國貨的存亡，有密切的關係，同時，我們自身也恐怕要發生不幸的事態呢？這是一個什麽問題？便是値得注意的『夏令用品』問題。</p>
<p>我們服用衣物，固然是隨時隨地，應該注意，可是，在這夏令裏，却是尤其値得我們討論，因爲在這一季裏，老實說：我們用的東西，確實比任何一季來得複雜呀！</p>
<p>因爲這個緣故，於是『怎樣購置夏令用品』的問題，便横擺在我們的面前，如何去解决這個問題呢？我倒有下面二個意見，現在發表出來，以　一得之　：</p>
<p>（一）家庭中應購置防疫的用品丨丨「時疫」這毛病，大家都認爲是十分可怕的，可是，時疫的發生，倒以夏季爲最多，所以在夏季裏，每個家庭中，應該購置些防疫的用品，如臭藥水，亞林沙而，藥水肥皂，┊┊等等，這些，都是最低限度的防疫用品，我很希望每個家庭中，都要購置一些，不特在衛生上是必需，同時，也是生活上所不可缺少的東西呢？</p>
<p>（二）應注意劣貨的冒牌推銷丨丨近來據報紙記載，劣貨的改頭換面傾銷，十分猛進，形勢又是十分險惡，這實在是一個很嚴重的問題，而且不容我們忽視的，爲了這個緣故，我們購置夏令用品，應該注意到這個問題，在購置之先，必須考慮老慮，到那種地方去購買，最爲妥當，到那裏種地方去購置，最易上當，這些，都是應該考慮到的問題，我很希望操購置物品之權的主婦們，切實的注意到這個地方，那才不致受奸商們的欺騙，同時，我們更須知道，多用一分中國貨，便是多救一個中國人，這種功德，眞是無量。</p>

<h3>關於國貨的夏令用品</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>光陰催人，一刹間又到了夏天！街頭的摩登女子，又穿起外國的時　紗，露着臂膊，修齊指甲，塗起蔲丹，赤着玉趾，套着外國革履！招摇過市！路人側目！推想到她們家庭裏的夏令用品，也必定非來路貨不辦了！</p>
<p>我回想起我們國貨的夏令用品，也不弱！美亞廠的喬其紗，乣縵縐，等┆┆五和織造廠的鵝牌汗衫，華生廠亞浦耳廠的電扇，中國化學工業社的三星牌蚊蟲香，三友實業社的浴衣，毛由，五洲藥房的臭藥水，殺蚊盤香，良丹，蠅殺倒，冠生園的菓子露，益利公司汽水，和玻璃杯，中國國貨公司經售的濮蓆，蒲扇，湖州鵝毛扇，鐵絲綠紗罩，籐車，應有盡有的國貨夏令用品，康元罐廠，新業工廠的殺蟲噴水器，也是小巧玲瓏丨至於菓品方面，有洞庭山之白沙枇杷，無錫三樂公司之水密桃，龍華之蟠桃，和虞山楊家溪，無錫許舍鎭，雪浪山　的楊梅（俗稱血裏红）衣的，吃的，眞是悅目，賞心！我和内子韻淸，見到有許多國貨購用，覺得異常愉快！不過我深深地希望！國貨還要精益求精的價廉物美丨遍及上中下社會打倒洋貨的能實現！末了，我更希望國貨界來一個「國貨夏令用品展覽會」</p>
<h3>撲蠅用的國貨用品</h3>
<p>— 杏芬女士</p>
<p>在夏天，疫厲猖獗的時令，我們與蒼蠅是勢不兩立的，假使我們不去撲滅牠，牠就要呑噬我們了。</p>
<p>俗話：「先下手爲强」，我們怎樣先下手去撲滅牠們呢？這可以分治本治標來講，治本最要緊就是除盡污水污物，要知道蒼蠅的高廳大厦是建築在污穢中的，但此法終不能使牠們絶對不再産生，况且已生的又很多，所以不得不用治</p>
<h3>我要問問你</h3>
<p>— 錢醉竹</p>
<p>丨國貨年的心理測騐丨</p>
<p>㈠你對於國貨年的意義，感到重大嗎？</p>
<p>㈡你今年購買了多少貨品，有幾分之幾是外貨？</p>
<p>㈢你曾想到，每一文錢流到外人袋裏時，將發生何種作用嗎？</p>
<p>㈣你的愛人，要用高價來路發時，你是否維持你的愛？</p>
<p>㈤你的孩子，要吃外國糖時，你是否順從他的心？</p>
<p>㈥你曾以爲，個人用不用國貨，没有關係嗎？</p>
<p>㈦便宜的外貨，與國貨同時陳列着時，你將選取那一種？</p>
<p>㈧你曾發現，極粗陋的國貨，也有牠的優點嗎？（錢在國人之手，等於一文未化）</p>
<p>㈨你曾覺得極　美的外貨，也有牠的劣點嗎？（錢去不來，雖賤亦貴）</p>
<p>㈩你對於需要某種用品，而又没有國貨可代時，你是否坦然購買，或者忍耐不用？</p>
<p>㈩㈠你覺得服用高等外貨，是很體面嗎？</p>
<p>㈩㈡你曾計算，你每年送給外人的錢，有多少嗎？</p>
<p>㈩㈢你曾以身作則領導家庭，一致購用國貨嗎？</p>
<p>㈩㈣你對於强聒不巳的「國貨年」感到反感嗎？最後，我要問你，我們生活環境，這樣苦悶，究竟是誰作怪？是什麽東西，害我們這樣困苦的？</p>
<p>請你想一想，再回答，或者你就要感到國貨年意義的偉大，和迫切了。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>標法了，治標法很多，我略述一些如下　　用臭藥水遍　各處，蒼蠅喜臭，可是牠很怕臭藥水之臭的；臭藥水中以雙刀牌爲最佳，而且價錢也很便宜。</p>
<p>用蒼蠅拍擊殺之，此法較用玻瑙的　蠅器要經濟耐用得多，我們自己做也很便捷，買點綠纱，剪成長方形，四邊稍摺，夾以長竹片卽成，如要再耐用些的話，可在綠紗四週縫以綠色布條，因爲蠅眼的構造是看不見綠色的。</p>
<h3>國料短裝　丨改良長衫丨</h3>
<p>— 南國佳人</p>
<p>衣服章身，品質與形式，種種差别，風俗習慣不同，好惡心理自異。和尙穿他的袈裟，道士服他的　巾，勞工着短服，兵士着戎裝，女士穿旗袍，文人穿長衫，各有歷史，各有自由，本用不着勉强，也無取乎更張。</p>
<p>何以言之？「物之不齊，物之情也。」同屬人類，而　色有别，毛髮之短卷舒有别，鼻凖之高低有别，手足之指模有别：可見上帝賦畀人類，本不樂其千篇一律。身體髮　，尙且如此；何况章身的衣服呢！</p>
<p>講起穿衣的由來，究竟是爲了羞恥而取其遮掩呢？保護體温呢？還是爲着裝飾美觀呢？熱帶上的深山民族，依然有祇取蕉葉一方掩其下體的，有的以銀片珠　爲蓋，一若示其重要器官之所在也者。這當然是爲了羞恥而掩飾的。寒帶上的居民，大概不消說得，爲的是保護體温，纔要穿起厚重的皮裘。温帶上的人呢，夏天的熱度有時遠過赤道，（例如今年芝加哥室内温度巳到了一百十二度，這是赤道上有罕有的。）然而裸運之風氣，决不能襲禮敎之「國門」。（香港香粉寮開始裸運，廣州當局下令嚴禁，先事預防，）這不能不說是「羞惡之心，人皆有之。」的道統的表徵。也就證明了我們的穿衣，一大半還是爲著美觀了。</p>
<p>現在要進而討論筆者所認爲「關繫匪輕」的普遍於華夏民族的文人們的「長衫」問題，</p>
<p>長衫的優點，據吾所聽到人家稱述的，一種是裙埀膝下，遮蓋褲襠，兩腿分叉處不至外露，可以十足表顯彬彬斯文氣息。一種是輕裙翩翩，隨風飄動，令人灑然有超脫　世之想。除此兩種禮敎的與藝術的觀點之外，再想不出什麽値得擁護的理由了。</p>
<p>我先得聲明：我决不鼓勵人家穿西裝，那領結，領帶的束縛頸項，剥奪了一部分俯仰伸縮的自由同樣是我所不能理解的。這樣，我可以暢論「長衫的罪狀」，離然不至於「擢髮」，却也不妨「僂指」：長衫之兩裙，費有用之衣料，背經濟之原則，一不宜也；行路時阻碍兩腿之推進，（阻力雖微，不可謂等於零。）二不宜也，逆風而行，則背後張旗；順風向前，則腹如石鼓。三不宜也；上樓下樓，例須　裙，小心翼翼，時虞隕越。四不宜也；工作旣然不便，紈袴　成習氣，五不宜也；參觀機器廠時，稍不留神，則皮帶挾之而飛，粉身碎骨，噬臍何及。六不宜也；騎脚踏車，必須前撈後摋，徒增麻煩，七不宜也；袍袖垂垂，長掩寸關，抹桌子，擦</p>
<p>黑板，沾菜羹，納污垢，垂袖而立，則柔巽頽唐之奴氣十足，八不宜也。</p>
<p>綜上八端，「長衫」爲二十世紀「落伍之服裝」；爲新生活運動中「腐化之尤物」，可無疑義。然而現在全國學校中的敎員學生，商店中的老　夥計，政界中的文班職員，十之七八，還是長衫同志，積習巳深，改革却也不易。</p>
<p>或曰：提倡國貨，宜崇國服。反對長衫，無異引繩而絶國貨之出路也。可是閱者勿疑，我對於長衫的輕便適體，不似西裝之麻煩，取爽快而不尙挺刮，是始終佩服的。我所要提出「改良長衫」的兩句口號是：</p>
<p>「裾長勿過膝」，</p>
<p>「袖長勿出腕」。</p>
<p>如此，無損於外觀，有裨於實際；行坐自如，作事便利。用國産之料而節其糜費：有西裝之便而不覺麻頪。又何憚而不爲呢！有人說，這樣恐怕不好看吧！那末吾將告以「試試看！」</p>
<h3>從草帽說起</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>當茲夏令，火傘高張，凡是要在馬路上奔走的朋友，莫不需要草帽，以遮這猛烈的陽光。</p>
<p>草帽在數年前，大都　硬邊平頂式的，近年來雖帶的人還多，但是，已不若軟邊銅盆帽式的來得盛行了。</p>
<p>在從前草帽「來路貨」的居多，現在國貨的草帽，也有了不少。不但，貨色之精良，式樣之美觀，都堪與「來路貨」相頡頏。而且，售價也較「來路貨」低廉。</p>
<p>但是，聽說：現在有一般帽商，竟異想天開，把這種「價廉物美」的國貨草帽，做入了英國某帽廠的牌子，以冒充「英國來路貨」出售！據說：這樣一來，便可高抬價格，以迎合一般「洋迷」的心理云。</p>
<p>唉！如果這是眞的話，我覺得自家旣有了很好的「國貨」，如華福草帽，何苦定要做入外國廠家的牌子，以冒充「來路貨」呢？要知道「洋貨冒充國貨，」罪無可　。而「國貨冒充洋貨，」贻害無窮！因爲，國貨蒙上了外國廠家的牌子，國貨縱使精良，國人無從辨識，於國貨前途的發展，大有妨礙！希望國貨廠家，此後對於這一點丨「國貨冒充洋貨」丨，應加以特别注意，有則改之，無則加勉。</p>
<h3>採用夏令用品歌</h3>

<p>可怕的暑天將到，</p>
<p>人們是感到生活上的變更了。</p>
<p>關於這一度夏令用品的添備，</p>
<p>自是覺得緊迫和需要。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們就得認淸了目標，喜用洋貨，再不是血性的人們所爲了，</p>
<p>提倡國産，却正是自己天職的所繫，</p>
<p>家喻戶曉的默認，</p>
<p>天經地義的存在，</p>
<p>一切的採購，</p>
<p>自惟向國貨公司，商塲去找。</p>
<p>「淸潔，美觀，與耐用，」</p>
<p>這本是我們採購前的原則，</p>
<p>也只有精美的國貨，纔能臻此。</p>
<p>倘你能集中一切消費在這裏，</p>
<p>自能使你整個夏令的滿意。</p>

<p>一方面熱心於社會事業，一方面并不放棄家政的管理，對於女界的福利，對於丈夫和兒女的幸福，同時能够兼顧。劉湛恩夫人王立明女士可以說是時代婦女中的一個典型。她是篤信基督敎的信徒，大同是她的理想，可是她認爲唯有自强以後才可以臻於大同；同時，她們主張男女平權的，一貫的主張女子獨立後才可以達到眞的平權。她們不是不要兒女的，爲着母性和兒女的</p>
<p>前途而主張節制，從質的發展而防止大量生産。更進一步的，婦女節制會的進行步驟推廣到「生活節制」所以劉王立明女士在談話中，下意識的主張：「我們生活要簡單丨」這是和國貨運動是有關係的，節檢除奢侈，由於自動的會屏除舶來品的消耗了她對於國貨運動的貢獻，因爲一般人對於國貨的服用，除去暫時感情因素的提倡以外，更看重貨品本身的價廉和質美兩點，希望實業界從這方面努力。談話時，她并且提出例證，一元五丈的布，經水便退色，那便是間接的妨碍國貨的前途了。</p>
<p>「我們不獨是主張提倡國貨，而且是實行者！」</p>
<p>她證明女聲社内服務的幾位女士丨楊美眞女士等的衣着都是國貨。</p>
<p>談鋒轉到婦女留養院（她們的事業）近今舉行的兒童服裝展覽會，那便是完全用國貨剪裁而成的童裝，男的有常服，海軍裝，便裝，女的有紫羅蘭，紅玫瑰等等，在剪裁方面加以努力，當八個孩子們穿着表演時，美麗不在舶來品之下。她并且拿出剩餘幾套，用作證明，據說，這次展覽的意義是：</p>
<p>「使一般人闢除國貨祇可作土布大掛的謬解。」</p>
<p>偶然的提到東游日本的印象，又談到一件嚴重問題：</p>
<p>「現在，我們實在有什麽是眞國貨，什麽是假國貨丨記得這次在日本，聽得人說，日本人在貨品完成以後，時常會冒用中國國貨的名義，有時竟會添句如果不用國貨天誅地滅的警句，（這也許是笑話」所以，我們不能不熱望工商界拿出良心來，維持眞正國貨的前途了！」</p>
<p>因爲目前有人懷疑國貨運動的意義，（當然是少數極端主義者）所以，我向王立明女士徵求一些美於學理方面的見解。</p>
<p>「一個人依靠他人，絶不能與被依靠的人平等，國家民族間也是這樣。我覺得提倡國貨是及於平等自强的一種道理，然而，最後的目的還在求達到平等與大同！」</p>
<p>談到敎會學校學生好用舶來品問題，她雖承認敎會學生因經濟地位關係比較趨於物質享受，可是，她根據滬江中西兩校最近的情形，樂觀的表示風氣巳轉變。據說，滬江女同學的衣着多是用國貨原料剪裁的。更進一步的，她主張對中學生有嚴格的訓練，使有服用國貨和穿着制服的習慣，到大學讀書的時候，便能養成一種風氣了。</p>
<p>關於婦女國貨年的工作，她主張由婦女界自動的幹；至於農村國貨運動，除去來自農村的靑年學生要負責恊助以外，在政府復興農村計劃中，我們也可以增加提倡國貨的規定。然而，她更進一步的覺得增加購買力是農村比都市更爲緊要。</p>
<p>最後，辭别時，她送我一本女聲「婦女與國貨專號」，開卷第一篇的題目是：</p>
<p>「娘子軍總動員！」</p>
<h3>國貨蚊香</h3>
<p>— 國輝</p>
<p>現在夏天到了！無量數的蚊蟲都帶着尖銳的毒嘴，到處傳染瘧疾，我們要肅淸這許多的惡蚊，先要使用澈底的辦法。</p>
<p>有許多人爲要殺除討厭的蚊蟲，購用劣貨殺蚊香或者劣料做成的殺蚊香，這樣夜間雖然得到了安息，但却給將來種下了自殺的禍根丨因爲誰都知道劣貨是一種侵略的政策，敵人拿劣貨換去我們的金錢，又以我們的金錢製成武器來殺我們。</p>
<p>所以蚊蟲固然可殺，劣貨尤不可用，如果要滅除蚊蟲的擾亂，儘可去購國貨使用，像五洲藥房的「地球牌殺蚊香」，完全用國貨的原料，一切效力均在劣貨之上。</p>
<h3>夏令用品禮贊</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>夏令，炎暑困人的夏令，時疫盛行的夏令，多麽的使人不舒服呀！人類終究是聰明的，人定可以勝天，於是便有扇子，草蓆，蚊香·殺蟲粉·汽水┆┆·</p>
<p>等發明。雖不能使炎威盡退，疾疫全消，對於人們的生活上，多少覺得舒適一些，安定一些。而且這幾種貨品，璧壘森嚴，陣線堅固，外貨不能侵入，這是値得歌詠感嘆的呀丨現在我胡謅幾首「非歌非謡，似新似舊」的東西在下面，聊表相當之敬意。</p>
<p>（一）扇子</p>
<p>扇呀！扇呀！扇去了雨淋珠掛般汗水：扇來了沁骨凉心的淸風，不過你切莫扇凉了我心頭沸滾的熱血，又給人譏笑着「五分鐘熱度有始無終」。</p>
<p>（二）草蓆</p>
<p>入晚炎威退，神倦眼迷茫。　草織作蓆，促人入睡鄕。勸君不要夢蝴蝶；勸君不要夢黃梁，古人臥薪今人蓆，薪刺　兮蓆生凉，刺　能把仇嘗滅：切莫貪凉酣睡忍令巨寇逞猖狂。</p>
<p>（三）滅蚊香</p>
<p>咄爾　魔，形同虺蛇，攻人不備，噏噏自誇。</p>
<p>吸脂飲血，爾何　　！貪得亡身，千古同轍。</p>
<p>殺敵利器，是曰蚊香。淸烟一縷，翅折身僵。</p>
<p>氣芬味輕，缭繞中空。千萬　劍，辟疫殺蟲。</p>
<p>（四）殺蟲粉</p>
<p>你們恐怕也傳得了「帝國主義者」的衣鉢吧！蠅兒是用着政治侵略；臭蟲是用着武力侵略；還有許多不知名的蟲兒，也摇旗呐喊的在助威。好！撳着長筒形的機槍；　着細霧般的子彈，殺！殺！殺！殺得那侵略的人們掩旗息鼓，片甲不完。</p>
<p>（五）汽水</p>
<p>你身子兒冰凉；你志氣兒騰　；即濤直濺三千丈，要把炎威兒滅；要把列日兒傷　祇可　人們把你牛飲鯨吸去，　　負你似凉　熱的好心腸。</p>
<h3>參觀大海軋髮刀剪廠記</h3>
<p>— 子根</p>
<p>余友沈君。有心人也。鑒於仇貨軋髮刀剪。大批傾銷。每年金錢外溢。何可勝數。且以此項刀剪。尙無精良國貨替代品。空言提倡。無裨實際。乃於民國廿一年秋。集资十萬。創辦大上海軋髮刀剪廠於上海龍華路。開辦迄今。出品日見精良。銷路年有進展。昨應沈君之招。前往參觀。廠址佔地十餘畝。内分鋸木，钳床，車床，刨床，鑽床，翻砂，鍍鎳，裝配，以及推廣等部。承工程師何君柏生詳細說明。深覺佈置井然。有條不紊。國貨工廠所僅見。各部工作頗爲緊張。故何君必須親自指導與監督。所出刀剪。較之舶來品。輕便耐用。故本埠理髮店多樂爲採購。據沈君語人。民元以來。國人一致剪髮。我國舊式剃刀。巳不適用。舶來品之軋髮刀剪。遂乘隙而入。其中尤以仇貨爲多。以致利　外溢。莫可挽回。迨一二八之役。同胞横遭殘殺。　目驚心。有動於中。於是决心創辦斯廠。專以抵制仇貨。商標卽取「一二八」三字。以示不忘國恥云爾。</p>

<h3>說荔</h3>
<p>— 無爲</p>
<p>南海運來的荔枝，多不熟。到上海灘上，色，香，味俱差。如有湘綺老人那樣的文才，仿「嘲哈密瓜賦」作一篇「嘲荔枝賦」，也許可盡詼詭　　之觀吧。但那要是湘綺老人作才有趣的。</p>
<p>在山泉水淸。出出泉水濁，在山爲遠志，出山爲小草，風氣使其然，環境使其然。尤其是時間性的東西，有風土性的東西，離　本來，要大改變。哈密瓜到了北平，就不像樣了。</p>
<p>十多年來傳到中國的東西不少了政治經濟，文學美術，罐頭牛肉，奶油　包，但大率改觀，失去固有的精神形態。但如太極拳山水盡，也有傳麫出去的，應該頗隔膜吧。丨神奇化爲　腐，自腐化爲神奇。終於是隔時隔地的關係。</p>
<p>雖則環境有影響，一大部分還是好乎其物，好乎其人，松柏茂而逾淸，冀桂老而彌烈。西施雖美，捧心就更美；　施不美，效　就更不美。如果别開生面，出拓淸新，化　腐爲神奇，也需要大功力，文學家美術家偶得之。因爲自出剪裁，明知本末，從權制勝，并不將　腐永遠當神奇。例如空城計，也只能設一次的。</p>
<p>然大人物紹介政治理論，小人物稗販文學美術，往往將香象弄成小鼠蚜蟲釋爲巨牛。這從可說，還是動物，畫虎而像冬瓜，就無法可想。然猶可說，只要自知。最無救藥的是故將臭腐當神奇，儼然自己是那麽一個批評家或革命領袖。如沙，明說是沙，不可恨，偏要說是牛津大學得來的金剛砂，使人不知其是眞痴或是瘋狂。卽令嚴封密裏，動色相示，也就相差太遠了。</p>
<p>荔枝乾了，還有荔枝乾，未及其新，不失其好。許多來自西洋的事物，簡直是乾矢　。</p>
<h3>從文白鬭爭到死活鬭爭</h3>
<p>— 樂炳</p>
<p>假如你肯用辯證法的頭腦寫出一部中國文章史，許多文　會告訴你：</p>
<p>「筆頭用語的死活鬥爭二千多年來没有間斷過，社會大衆日常生活所必需的文　，都用活人嘴頭常說的話做基礎，整千整萬自動地化錢買來看的書，也是越接近活話越受歡迎；活人裝鬼呌，决討不了巧，用半死半活的文言作成文印成集，跟實際社會絲毫不發生關係。」</p>
<p>古人試舉李白作例，他的詩，在一般社會可以抵鈔票用；</p>
<p>文，就不値錢了。今人試舉最近文言運動的發難人汪懋祖作例，他用文言作過兩篇擁護文言的文章，然而他的大文，如果請聖陶拿它送進文學病院，解剖一下，不知道該笑痛多少人的肚子。</p>
<p>文言運動的再起，雖說祇是部分的某種復古意識的表露，可是過去對社會負責的文人也有相當的過錯。三四十年前提倡白話文的所謂「白話」「白是道白」的「白」，話是活話的「話」，同廣東話的「白話」相彷，是土話的意思。五四運動之後，有人把它歪曲作「明白如話」解說，胡適的「白話文學史」，拿歷史上半死半活的文言都塞　進去，活話和鬼話的界限也就跟着模糊起來。祇要把「焉者乎也」改成「了的嗎呀」，滿篇鬼話也算白話。進一步，所谓五四産兒，ＸＸ等以及所謂國語專家，ＸＸＸＸ等，都公然作起古文來，繫鈴人自動的解鈴了，自　而下怎麽怪得了呢！</p>
<p>話和文，同是人們社會意識的標誌，社會意識不停地變動，話當然也連帶變動。文跟話發生差異，那文就不能正確地表現當時的社會意識；因此，充滿封建意識的古文固然没有復活的可能；同樣，明白如話的白話文文言文和語錄體之類，也該掃除乾凈。</p>
<p>我們應當糾正文白鬥爭的過錯，積極地發動死活鬥爭，除了繼續禁阻文言的死灰復燃，爲大衆利益起見，對於活話寫成的活文時候所有問題，也該有相當的决定和努力：丨</p>
<p>一，確認話文同源，話和文不可分離，話跟着社會意識的發展向前發展，文也該跟着話隨時變動；同例，最近陳子展先生所說一大衆語文學在詩歌小說戲曲三類說聽着三樣都須顧到一的話，就不很妥當，爲尊重大衆利益起見，應當更正成「一切文字都該話文合一」。</p>
<p>二，確認普遍性最大的北平話作現代活話的基凖，大衆語文學的主要成分三，承認「文」可以合理地自動地吸收做新成分，補足話的缺點。</p>
<p>四，爲减輕大衆寫文的困難：（甲）把話寫下來就算文，（乙）提倡簡字，寛容别字。</p>
<h3>文言的前途</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>近來又有人因學生學文言結果陷於不通，向提倡文言者抗議了，我斷言：這抗議是無效的！提倡者原來就不要文章丨尤其是能表自己的意思的文章僅僅以重文言文爲使人非讀古書不可的手叚而巳。　　白話文如果僅僅走到胡適所提倡的地步爲止，一方面儘管寫白話文，一方面仍不忘那一束大而無當的最低國學書目，文言文也許不再起來。然而白話文起了胡適所意想不到的效力，白話文不僅改變了文章的形式，而且改變了文章内容，這内容不必與古書發生關係，於是那最低書目完全被抛擲到最低之外。</p>
<p>在五四時代反對白話文和在今日提倡文言文的人，是不相同的：前者决不容認白話，後者只要人能寫四書五經式的白話文，一定能够容認。只因爲要寫白話的人寫四書五經式的文章，决不可能，於是仍只有提倡文言。他們也知道復興文言文並不可能，但他們以爲至少可以勉强人讀一點古書。</p>
<p>直接提倡讀經的時代的今天没有鳥！</p>
<p>歐美著名政治　刺畫（據申報月刋複製）</p>
<p>不能再來，可以使我們無須多抱悲觀，　接的辦法能收多少效果，實在是疑問。格格不相入的意見，就讀熟也不能佔有腦中的一角。誰也不再願意爲了文章去鎔經鑄史。</p>
<p>學生的文言文的不通，不僅是文字不好；更大的理由是他們無話可說。我看見過一些作文題目，都根本是就敎能寫通的文言文的去寫，也勢必寫得不通的。而事實上我們也早巳有了許多煌煌大文作例。</p>
<p>就那些煌煌大文，事實上也再受不到像古代的高文典册樣的重視，因之除煌煌大文外仍得偕重白話文作其輔助。這一點，又證明直接使人由古文去求古道巳不可能，終有一天間接提倡失敗，就要再加一個間接，把古書翻成白話。</p>
<p>所以，現在對白話文實在無須担憂。他們終有一天更聰明而利用白話文的，至於白話文被利用後是不是另有可担憂處呢？那也不見得有，白話的女兒經還不是和文言的女　一樣地不能在現在維持其勢力。</p>

<h3>商學院公演觀後感（上）</h3>
<p>— 白薇</p>
<p>商學院於六月十六晚在湖社公演了兩　　：一齣是在上海演得最多的菊池寛他的「父歸」；一齣是法國劇本「重燃壞了的火」黎（烈文先譯），</p>
<p>我没有看到「父歸」；只看了「重燃壞了的火」。這劇本在上海是初次上演的，自然要給觀衆一種新的感受，同時也抓住了觀衆緊張沉着的心吧？</p>
<p>劇本的結構和對白，在我們没有多少戲劇條養的人看來，是技巧到太技巧了，那嚴密精細的组織，入理入情的一層深刻一層的那迫進的情調，眞使觀衆和得不沉細着呼吸去賞鑑它。它，尤其給與了羅曼史濃厚的靑年男女以一些够味的咀　吧，更給與了過着夫婦生活的伉健們，以一種　鐘　鼓般的刺激吧；它，是說明了戰爭的殘酷，又淋漓盡致地描　了疑妬的暴風雨。除了這些之外，它還給我們甚麽感想呢？</p>
<p>像近年女人留着長頭髮，綣綣曲曲的披在肩上一樣；像女人穿長旗袍，温文爾雅的在地上拖一樣；像女子穿四寸高跟鞋，滴噠滴噠地響着節奏的音律一樣；我覺得這個劇本正有着那同樣優閒的精美的風姿，顯在我底面前。</p>
<p>這些姿態是風雅的，精緻的，美妙的。同時也是　費的，開倒車的，資本主義尖端化的，明示着一種廢而且反動的傾向。</p>
<p>不是麽？劇作者用極　富的精力，浮彫的筆法，表現了一個平凡帶病的羅漫史，他使男主角底眼光那末狹窄，只看見愛情，看不見比愛情還重大的一切東西，致弄成了這樣一齣無可奈何的悲劇，而說這全是戰爭造成的。不錯，「戰爭不知孤寡了多少人的妻子，破壞了多少幸福的家庭！」這點，劇作者是十分做到了，刻骨地咀咒了戰爭。然而戰爭，還給劇作者認識了一些甚麽呢？如果劇作者所認識的，竟和這個劇本中所表現的一模一樣，那末，資本主義的戰爭，越是太無意思了！</p>
<p>當歐戰開幕時，中學敎員安特烈，被驅往前綫做砲灰，飽嘗了戰塲生活，俘虜生活，經騐了悲慘殘忍的一切，這樣過了四年，直到休戰才被釋放回家。</p>
<p>四年的戰爭經騐，给他認識了甚麽呢？好像除了知道受苦之外，他就只　得疑心愛妻和寄居他家　的美國軍官有　節的行爲，只曉得妬恨愛妻和那美國軍官發生了愛情。此外，他是甚麽都没有認識了。</p>
<p>不是麽，那次戰爭給與全歐洲社會人類整個的悲慘，戰爭只爲着資本主義的野心而戰爭，戰爭只爲着少數高貴的人們底利益，地位，和支配權，而驅逐無限的被支配者去犠牲受苦，死亡，破壞無限人民的幸福，這些，他並没有認識，也並不想去認識。甚至他老父說的：「只是愁嘆着的勒郎施，我有時還覺得她念你念得太過了呢┆┆┆當别人來看她時，她連話都不曉得說了。「如果安特烈在家時，如果安特烈在我身邊時┆┆」除掉這幾句話以外┆┆」這些關於他愛妻苦念他的經過，他也無心去體帖，體帖，他也並没有感動。</p>

<h3>桂英爸（六）</h3>
<p>— 曄子</p>
<p>「小玉一天天的　起來，連從前的大紳士莊四爺和拿大人也光降到我們的　　裏來了。他們見了我，居然拱拱手，稱我老太爺。對於小玉，當然更客氣了，小玉對我說，他瘊是土豪劣紳，平常最會欺壓平民，現在黨部裏要辦他們，所以向小玉求情。小玉要他們捐出一大筆錢給平　局，但是他們不肯。到了最後，他們帶着家眷逃走了。</p>
<p>「在這時候，小玉每天向我們講些道理。這孩子平常是不大說的話的，現在却一開口就說不完。桂英是本來多話的，現在跟　阿哥，更是說不淸了。我不能完全　得他們的話。只相信人和人應該平等，不該有　富之分，這是眞的。但是我的老婆子不相信這些話。他說窮富是命裏註定的，命裏窮的　要　，命裏　的總會富。她說小玉現在比知事還大，這也是命裏生成的。她要小玉替她做網緞的衣服，買大　子。小玉没有答　，她就發怒了。她駡小玉兄妹没有良心，現在得意了，連家裏也不管。那麽做大富有什麽用！誰曾見做官的人的家裏是這個樣子的，倒楣不倒楣！小玉說，他並没有做官，他是帮助窮人的革命黨，豈可自己拿了窮人的錢去享福？但老婆子總是不相信。她說，你騙誰？你不是常務委員麽？你不是　藥局長麽？這不是做官麽？你不做　，爲什麽知事要你封！帮窮人，帮窮人，窮人都是賤骨頭，帮他們做什麽？你不是自己　，便是有意騙我。</p>
<p>我面以爲老婆子不懂事，但一面也以爲小玉有點狀。那時候，黨部裏的别的委員，多半把自己的家裏裝得比從前漂亮，自己穿的衣服也一天天的好起來。他們明明撈了許多的錢，只有小玉却不會撈。不過我並不怪他，因爲小玉一向是個好孩子，我相信他的行爲總是對的。而且，那時候，我們家裏其實巳比先前有錢，小玉　了敎育局長丨老婆子不懂得，說做　藥局長，哈哈。桂英也做了女校的校長，他們的薪水比先前加了许多了。我家總算交了好運了。</p>
<p>好運來得太快，所以去得也極快。我的小玉做不到三個月的常務委員，局面又變了，省裏換了一批人、縣裏的人也完全換過，常務委員落在莊老五那光棍身上，我的小玉没有份了。再過幾時，敎育局長也没得做了。因爲知事也換了人。從此以後，一　　紳士又出頭，也算是革命黨，和小玉一班人作起對來。小玉的朋友們，有许多逃到上海去了。但是小玉没有逃，他有一次到西鄕去，許多時候没有回家，我不知送他去幹什麽，我等在城門口，第逢西鄕人進城，我就问小玉的消息。有的人告訴我：	你們小玉先生眞是好人，他看得起我們窮人，他說　　助我們，反對財主要求减粮。過了半個月，有一天忽然有七八百西鄕人進城，　住莊老五的縣黨部，要黨部繼續　平　局，　辦土　劣绅。他們又到大財主莊四爺的家裏，</p>
<p>逼着莊四爺承認减租。足足閙了大半天，他們　出城。在城門口看到我的時候，他們都對我點點頭。有的告訴我，這件事是小玉敎他們做的。</p>

<h3>民族的診斷</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>彷彿大家都是這麽嚷着：我們是優秀的民族，中因人是泱泱乎的大國民。是的，我也頗爲承認；我自己可以絶對擔保，我並不鄙視任何同胞，我不會改入異族的國籍，更不想當亡國奴。我是文明華　的子孫，也是光耀史蹟的漢族，永遠的我將這樣的自傲着，自信着。不過我對於同胞却有一種認識，因爲有一種認識，就使我覺得我們的同胞，我們的民族，確有一種最大的危機。危機是什麽呢？就是「民族的缺陷與衰老」，因爲民族的缺陷與衰老就每個同胞都彷佛在朝後退。這後退到了今日，巳經是最危險的時期了。一般的說來，人類應該是進步的，發揚的，而我們的民族而竟是退步的，衰老的，這是無可諱言的隠憂。</p>
<p>據我所觀察，我們的民族，是有着下面的幾種缺陷，這不過是概括的說法，其實縷析起來，還不止這些，簡直是滿身窟蕯，滿身瘡　，找不到一塊干凈的肉體，這绝不是我的苛刻，而是鋼一般可靠的事實。</p>
<p>現在我且大略的來列舉幾種吧：</p>
<p>第一就是惰性特甚，當初我來到江浙一帶，見了隨處有着茶館，茶館裏都是擠滿着人客，我很驚奇，覺得這是民生富裕的表徵。其實並非如此，而是充分的一種民族的惰性的表現，因爲我觀察到坐在茶館裏的多數同胞，並不是生活優裕的份子，反倒全是一些苦力游民。再看我們的同胞，誰不愛蹺起雙脚搏瓜子，整日儘不管正經事，也足以佐證惰性的滋長，惰性的普遍。在上海這個地方，同胞們更是特别的懶惰，有僅僅相隔一站路，懶得動脚走，必要坐六枚地電車　放心，要是我想上車下車的麻煩，倒不如一走就到了的方便，然而我見過许多的同胞是這麽着。這是惰性發達的極致。</p>
<p>第二就是敷衍將事，這是根原於第一點來的，因爲惰性特别發展，必然的每個同胞都像懶蛇一頭，做起事來，只要能够敷衍得過去，就敷衍過去，比方造一座房子，本來是要多少工力，多少材料，纔可以造得穏，造得好，但我們可以把它縮减一半，似乎很便當的就把它造成了。不過，如此這般的結果，也就經不起狂風暴雨的射擊，坍覆傷人，是常有的事。</p>
<p>第三是樂天安命，這又是根據第一第二兩點來的，因爲懶惰敷衍的結果事實上是必要出亂子，出了亂子怎樣呢？並不歸咎事實，也不怪别人，只管自己揑着鼻出氣，說是自己的命運不好，無法挽救，天公是這樣虐待你，有什麽辦法。這樣一來，也就一切都完了，永遠没有翻身的希望。因爲是這樣，就不會去省察眞實的事實，事實對於吾人的處置是非常苛刻的，它斷不會因爲你曾經失败過受傷過而肯容恕你，不來第二次的射擊，它是乘虚而入，無有底限的，「天」和「命」怎能安排它呢？</p>
<p>是這樣的，這樣的，我們的民族，自然只有日卽下墮，日卽衰落。於是弄到結果，敵人打我一拳、我也就忍辱忍痛得住，事實上也只有忍辱忍痛之一法。現在，復興民族的口號，似乎在呌得震天價響，我希望呌者們注意到這些，要根本將我們的民族翻造一次，從無底的深淵中拯救出來，　　有辦法。</p>

<p>地球是在轉，地球是在跑，這個年頭兒是轉變了，益發不像個樣子，以前大批從學校裏跑出來的靑年，除了絶少數是憑着眞本領是找到了出路，然而一大部份是因私人的情感關係而有了出路，可是現在都不行，要是靑年們只憑着私人的情感去謀出路的時候，那末非四面碰壁不可，至多是聽到幾句好聽的客氣話而已。</p>
<p>的確這個年頭裏，情感已抵不上利害了。</p>
<p>我們看看社會上的人，對於我們靑年，除了利害關係之外，很少肯帮助你的，商人來是不用說，自古以來，商人重利，而現在呢？却是整個社會裏的人羣都這樣了，除非是不得勢的人，連文人也都是這樣的。</p>
<p>有的時候，學校裏一班畢業生，大約總有三四十人，校長因爲是社會上有地位的關係，所以開始爲他們介紹職業了，結果出人意料之外，一班三四十人中間只介紹了二個人的職業，而這二個人，既不是學問最好，又不是品行端正，更不是情感關係，原來是利害所使，因爲這二位學生並是最不用功，專門開會胡閙，有一次學潮是他們帮助校長的，不錯他們是忠實的走狗，彼其時也，話走狗，爲校長利用，此其時也，有出路，校長给他相當的報効，這利害的關係嗎？靑年們，做走狗是找出路呀！　　由此可見，現在的人大家只有互相利用，有了我利用你的時候，然後再有你利用我的時候，所謂感情，只有在電影院裏酒樓中，吃吃談谈的時候用得到，等到酒完戲散的時候，大家又板起了，鐵靑的面孔，唯利是圖。</p>
<p>還有一點：我們常常可以感覺到的，便是平常很要好的朋友，但是一旦到了跨登龍門的時候，你去會他，那一定是擺起了一付神氣十足的怪樣子，令人看了討厭，這是因爲情感二字是早以忘記的了。</p>
<p>因了上述的各種原因，我們就可以知道。現在的社會又轉變了，過去可以用感情維緊的，目前却只有昨害話驅使　　　　　　　日　好也都是可　的，不過有一點需要聲明，就是裙帶關係，或許可以超脫乎這一個原則。</p>
<p>事實上，我們是看得淸淸楚楚，明明白白，人情世態之所以變成這樣，完全是由於生存竸爭的益發劇烈底緣故，我願意讀者們都學習一點登龍妙術，以期榮宗耀祖，而免得常常去求敎人家，反而博得白眼惡聲。</p>
<p>總之一句，靑年們最重要的還是學術技能培養，但是爲速成起見，不能不學做走狗，活動活動，自吹自捧，使達官偉人們眼花撩亂而器重於你，這樣不但是成功捷徑，而且登龍有望矣。</p>
<p>不信請看成功之人，誰個不吹牛屁，誰個不拍馬屁，又誰個不做走狗，所以但求今日無狗可做，何愁他日没龍可登，靑年朋友們，這是現世一條成功秘訣，不信便永遠只有爲狗欺。</p>
<h3>荔枝灣回憶</h3>
<p>— 白帆</p>
<p>流浪人的心情，是多麽凋切地，同時是懷戀着故鄕啊。</p>
<p>我的故鄕在老遠的南國里，可是，我離開她巳經一年了；那里有許多許多的東西依然吊在流浪的人底心頭啊。　　　　六月，南國里都充滿了酷暑的氣息，怪悶人的啊。夜之神快要降臨了，太陽還露着一絲的殘紅躱在西方的山上，老遠的天界。晚凉的風輕輕地吹進我的心頭，那時候，我曾到郊野里散步，或登上觀音山上看看廣州市整個的景色，然而那麽嚣張的，充滿了炭的氣息的馬路上。高低不齊的房宇，吃人的汽車，在人叢中奔駛着的┆┆密我看厭了，我愛荔枝灣上的江水，輕輕地，掉着艇兒，和朋友談心，</p>
<p>那一個晚上，我到白英的家里去。帶着那麽高興的情調；</p>
<p>「哈囉！你來了，我剛要找你到大新公司去呢」</p>
<p>我到她家的門外時，她穿着白衫黑裙的學生裝那麽跳跳地出來了。</p>
<p>「到大新公司做什麽去？」</p>
<p>「買一點東西。」</p>
<p>「我想找你到荔枝灣去啊」</p>
<p>她側着腦袋，妮着嘴巴，像不樂意似的，我輕輕地對她說了：</p>
<p>「這樣好的天氣，我們玩玩去是最好的呵。」</p>
<p>於是，她很快樂地和我一塊兒去了。</p>
<p>在荔枝灣，有美麗的少女們在游泳，有一雙一雙的男女們在談情，是廣州的天堂呵。</p>
<p>我們化了兩角錢的長途汽車便到了，僱了一隻花艇兒，掉着，掉着，離開了臭污的地方，穿過紅紅綠綠的靑年男女們的游泳塲所，那時我照着那些女兒</p>
<p>們的曲綫，却被白英輕輕地打我的嘴兒說：</p>
<p>「你這男人是靠不住的，眼定定地看什麽？」</p>
<p>於是，我們笑着。</p>
<p>荔枝灣是談情的地方，每一個晚上有許多百雙男女們在水面上輕輕地蕩漾着的。</p>
<p>我們照着淡綠的水，瞧着蔚藍色的天空。瞧着幾粒吊在沉默的天空里底星兒。那時淸凉的風輕輕地吹動我們靑春的心。偎着，緊緊地。</p>
<h3>文壇的一致性</h3>
<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>「文壇比不得官塲，」我往前是這樣的相信；但，現在可有些懷疑了。</p>
<p>「唯命是聽，」這是官塲中天經地義的信條。上司下一道命令，不管是怎樣，幕僚下屬們，都要默然照樣的做去才對；及至上司的意思一旦轉變，將以往所有的一切「成績」都一概推翻，而另起爐灶，轉從新的方向走，那爲下屬者，雖覺盡棄前功的可惜，另走新路的麻煩和無道理；但，除能在内心有點愠意外，也是不得不馬上隨之轉變的；倘有多少違慢之意流露於外，不但飯碗將被打破，還生怕發生性命的危險。這些事實，想是大家誰都曉得的。</p>
<p>在文藝的領域，雖没有這麽明顯的分開：誰是領袖，誰是部屬；大家的關係，雖也没有這麽的緊嚴：由上而下，絲毫拂亂；但，如果以幾個權威作家比之爲上司，一大羣靠筆桿兒吃飯，而頭角不大顯露的小卒們，（小卒乃權威作家之對稱，並没有含着譏誚辱駡的意思。）比之爲下屬，那情形可就恰像同出一轍了；因爲我們看見，每當幾個權威作家起了一次轉變時，一大羣靠筆桿吃飯的小卒們，也都相率隨着他們走了。雖然，每次當轉變的起始，小卒們也覺得這樣太没有道理，太與自己的意見相違背，因而羣起向幾個權威作家來一回熱烈的攻擊和反抗；而權威作家們雖也没有執着指揮刀，强迫大家都要隨着他們走，甚且，有的更很坦白地表明他的態度說：文藝是多方面的，各隨乎自巳的意志所近，走各人自巳選定的路好了；但，不曉怎的，一時表面上盡管施攻擊反抗之能技，文藝領域的走路，盡管這麽的分歧百出；而小卒們，仍要在暗地大行模倣起權威作家來，甚且唯恐做不到肖像的地步。</p>
<p>前幾年，有人提倡普羅文學，首先是受了不少的攻擊和咒駡的，但過無幾時，普天之下盡皆普羅了：前年有人提倡幽默文學，首先是受了不少的攻擊和咒駡的，但過無幾時，普天之下，盡皆幽默了；今年有人提倡小品文，首先是受了不少的攻擊和咒駡的，但，現在看來又似大有小品文統一文壇之慨了。中國的新文學運動，雖只有十餘年的歷史，但在這十餘年中間，誰計得出是換了多少回不同的花樣了呢？而在每一次轉換中間，不是先則羣起攻擊，後則羣趨擁和嗎？</p>
<p>旣不是受着指揮刀的指使，文學的走路，又是這麽的分歧蕪雜，而普天之下的大小作家們，徧會同在一條路上跑，這看來豈不是很希奇和神秘嗎？我想，這大概也莫非是因吃飯問題從中作崇吧？因爲偶像的崇拜，是成爲中國人牢不可破的習性，而一班編者又只是唯權　作家之馬頭是　：一般無名的小卒們，爲要保持每月若干塊　收入的稿費額，就不得不放棄自巳的意見和主張，而迎合一班編者與讀者的口胃了。</p>
<p>由於吃飯問題没有解决，而致使文壇漸趨於一致化，這現象是好是壞，我不敢說，不過，只覺得這情形與官塲的情形有點相像而巳。</p>
<h3>團圞</h3>
<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>童年時在故鄕看社戲，看見打扮得像鍾馗一樣的凈角，起初總是無惡不作，强横一世，但最後不是遭了殺身之禍，就被拿囚禁，以終其生；打扮得弱不禁風似的小生，起初總是窮途潦倒，到處碰壁，但結果不是衣錦還鄕，就登仙成佛；因爲要這樣，劇本纔算團圝，團圝觀衆纔歡迎，纔滿意。</p>
<p>今年來，曾轟動一時的「姊妹花」和「空谷蘭」，（重映）我家王媽和我的朋友小陳，是统統看過的。前天我特地問他們，這二劇到底是那一本來得動人？他們的答覆都相一致：丨丨當然「空谷蘭」好的多丨其理由，據說「空谷蘭」團圝，「姊妹花」没有團圝。（其實也作爲團圓了的，編者注）</p>
<p>王實甫作西廂記，只作到「碧雲天，黃花地」而止，時入認不團圝，而爲之續作，（據馬玉銘的考據，續作非出自關漢卿之手筆，）續作雖是「狗尾續貂，」但，　來讀者都很滿意，都同聲讚好；因爲要這樣，始能團圝。</p>
<p>「團圝」，是成爲我們中國人心目中的一條天經地義的大道理。一個人，痛痛苦苦的開始，又痛痛苦苦的結局，這些事實，或许是誰都曾親自看見過的；但，人是有後代，有來世的呀！此生雖然如此結束，但，子孫們，或及至轉生來時，誰敢說不會得到快快活活的團圝的一天呢？一個人，受苦負屈，没有得到善報，是谁都不肯輕易相信的！</p>
<p>中國人的生命，原就是緊繫在這「團圝」上面的！</p>
<p>業餘信箱</p>
<h3>「答應她一個請求」的質疑（一）</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>六月十二日業餘信箱内答應她一個請求，我讀了，覺得先生的答覆，有討論一下的餘地？</p>
<p>（一）一夫多妻，是否絶對不可行？</p>
<p>（二）王君的小姨，此後如不能另嫁，又怎樣？</p>
<p>第一，我以爲反對一夫多妻，是有條件的，對於一種的法制，不能機械地運用和迷信她。要加以深刻的檢討！在封建社會，視女性爲奴隷，資本主義社會，視女性爲商品，男性壓迫，佔有女性，一夫多妻的實現，是男性爲主動，男性爲了享樂或縱慾，以權力和金錢，去壓迫多數女性，這是男性　蹂女性的表現所以我們在相當條件之下，是反對一夫多妻的丨丨丨但是，一切的法制，都隨社會的發展而改變，如將來的社會，女性得到眞正的解放，男女眞正平等的時候，没有誰壓迫誰，如兩性間性情投洽，互想戀愛，共同努力於事業，相與切磋琢磨，那麽「多妻」「多夫」都是可能而且是不妨的事！根本用不到反對！</p>
<p>第二，我以爲王君的特殊條件，是値得討論的：</p>
<p>（一）他不是主動的丨丨這段事的主動是出於他的小姨，並不是王君去誘惑她，而是她愛慕他，而向他請求，决不可與一般謀多妻的男性，相提並論。</p>
<p>（二）純潔的愛情丨丨王君的小姨，和他相識也有二年之久，到最近始有這個要求，可見决非浪漫行爲，是王君有値得她愛慕的條件，經過她長期考　而决定的丨王君月入只二十元，而她　妹倆是店員，都是勞動階級，所以她决不可與一般愛慕男子的權勢金錢而願爲姨太太的女子，同日而語丨王君旣有令人愛慕的條件則愛苗的滋長，亦極自然的事丨先生責王君過去「太疏忽」，勉王君將來以「冷淡」，殊爲失當，誰能對親戚不相見呢？誰能禁入們的單戀呢？我想將來的事實，會證明出王君能否實行冷淡？我以爲這純潔的愛情的滋長，如認爲可貴，則根本不應阻遏！先生不是贊同結婚以戀愛爲本的嗎？王君和小姨戀愛着，那麽爲什麽不能得到同結婚的幸福呢？</p>
<p>（三）經濟和性慾的物質條件丨丨王君和她倆都是勞動階級，她倆姊妹的情感，更顯示出偉大的摯愛丨她倆同意同嫁，决不會發生什麽嫉妬於其間丨因三角戀愛中的嫉妬，是資産階級的佔有慾作崇，是女性甘爲　物的傳統奴隷性和商品　的　　！　個倚　男性生活的女性，爲了　位和生活，自不得不向一個男性爭　而互相嫉妬！若是兩個女子，都有職業，都能自食其力，經濟都能獨立，那麽决無向一個男性爭寵的必要，嫉妬也無從生丨所以王君如果眞和她倆同结婚，三人同居，同游，同息，解决了性慾，解决了生活，有職時則共同努力於公餘的事業，爲社會的進展盡微力；失業時，則互相扶助，勸慰，勉勵，不是很好的生活下去嗎？爲什麽結婚以二人爲限，而必三去其一呢？所以我　爲王君的問題，倒在他的未婚妻是否眞會同意？是否她仍有傳統的嫉妬爭寵的遺毒？如不同意，則自以和小姨冷淡爲佳，從生理上講，女子有月經和妊娠的禁慾期，所以一夫二妻的相處，性慾也有相當的滿足，</p>
<p>由　幾個條件的特殊情况看來，王君和她倆結婚，决不是一般的一夫多妻，不必一味反對丨倒要從實際環境去指導。以免演出悲劇！</p>
<p>第三，假使王君導先生的指導，小姨的前途，實成問題？失戀後的消熱，往往發生自殺或獨身的事實，固不必說；另介紹男友，改戀他人，恐屬難能吧？王君如冷淡了，爲她介紹男友，是否會中意而熱戀，實不可必？照事實的可能性講，王君的小姨，將來或因閱人更多，而更發現王君的値得愛慕的好處，眞的獨身不嫁，或過幾年，再向王君請求，那時豈不是這問題仍没有解决嗎？先生又將怎樣去指導呢？先生是否始終反對她嫁王君，坐視她獨身呢，所以我　先生這　是做了一　悲關的導演　也許現在王君己遵先生的指導，悲劇巳在開演？也許實際的環境，客觀的實踐，會證出先生，主觀理論的謬誤，王君背叛了導演，拍演悲劇，將悲劇變爲喜劇，</p>
<p>先生這封信務必請你發表出來，如認爲對，就請王君作！個更正！不對，或者發表出來，讓大家討論，或蒙先生再加以答覆：糾正，都是我所歡迎的！</p>
<p>順頌</p>
<p>撰安！</p>
<p>李世榮啓</p>
<p>李君原函甚長，有二千四百餘字，因篇幅關係，祇能摘要公表，編者至以爲　我的答覆則在明日登載。</p>

<h3>撤職</h3>
<p>— 陶然</p>
<p>這天下午，打字員李梵給喚進秘書室裏。普通一個打字員是不輕易走到這裏的，在李梵　聽到這個命令時，就心上一　，料想有什麽特殊的事情發生了嗎。</p>
<p>秘書室裏坐着徐秘書，在他尖尖瘦瘦的瓜子臉上，彷佛劃出深沈和嚴酷的　紋。</p>
<p>「你的工作太機械太單調麽？」問的太奇突了，李梵找不出什麽話來回答他。</p>
<p>「現在就請你離開此地」！徐秘書下了撤職命令。</p>
<p>一個晴天霹靂，打在李梵心上。！</p>
<p>半　　掙出一句話來。</p>
<p>「我没有過這個希望啊！」</p>
<p>「希望麽？不要你希望，這裏巳替你决定了，今天就請你離開此地！」</p>
<p>「但是，應當讓我知道一點被撤職的理由。」</p>
<p>「理由！」徐秘書露着不屑的神氣：</p>
<p>「主任報告你不願意在這裏工作。」</p>
<p>李梵恍然了。他知道這次主任結婚，他没有送得出多重的禮、於是在秘書前搗鬼、把他撤職了。</p>
<p>「但是，徐秘書，我在這裏工作是始終盡職的，我從來没有違拗過主任在公事上的命令、我也没有怠忽過分内的職務。」他說着，在手裏抽出了每天的工作紀錄，「這裏是主任親筆的工作紀錄報告單。」的確李梵對於職務方面是一向勤懇的，這一點，徐秘書也有些知道。</p>
<p>徐秘書有些猶豫起來；，「這裏是根據了主任的報告，主任這樣報告，這裏就這樣辦。」他的意思似乎呌李梵向主任去要求：可是李梵一向就厭恨透了這個主任。主任的卑鄙，無恥，在李梵簡直就看不上一眼，尤其是主任那副閻王似陰森的面孔、和夜鴟似的奸險的笑聲，使李梵一想起就憎惡。</p>
<p>「我要求徐秘書能給我一個機會，因爲秘書要我們的是對職務的盡職，而不是對人的盡職。」李梵自以爲這兩句話是說得很懇切很眞實和合理的。　　然而徐秘書却惱怒了。「什麽？」兩只眼睛在李梵面上掠過，似兩支火光，惡狠狠的。</p>
<p>「我希望┆┆」不等李梵往下說，徐秘書早就截住了他的話，厲聲呵斥着：　　「出去，這裏没有你說話的地方，出去丨出去丨┆」</p>
<p>只有權威，只有勢利，眞理和光明，單上了黑暗的外衣，李梵經不住難堪的侮辱，一氣冲出了秘書的辦公室。</p>
<p>憤懣在李梵心底裏燃起了炎炎的烈焰，想燒毁了自己，燒毁了世界，燒毁了全世界一切的一切！</p>

<h3>節母坊（七）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>他心裏覺着牠們非常可憐，同時也覺心頭有說不出的快樂。他一面看着蟋蟀吃，一面在想！現在我總不怕姑媽，不怕她的大頭鬼利害，我新捉來這麽多，無論如何，總會有一個鬥得　牠的。不久他搬出那一個大的圓洋鐵筒來，自己先來一次預賽。凡是敗了的　關在另一個竹籠裏去，祇有一隻接連鬥　了三隻。這一隻蟋蟀，直是利害，祇要看牠頭上似乎有一個五字，便可證明牠確是了不起。他决定去偷一片高麗參给牠吃，等一會兒跟姑媽的鬥起來，一定會鬥得非常激烈的。</p>
<p>時敏始終覺得有說不出的快樂，而且很急。一想幾天來自己的蟋蟀，總有十隻以上給她的大頭鬼鬥敗了，而現在却相信一定可以打一次勝仗，便不由的心頭跳個不住。現在是一切都預備停當了。那一個蟋蟀吃了參以後，似乎立刻大了许多。祇要等姑媽做完了那些鎖碎的事，便可以大殺一塲。好容易等着姑媽來了，當她看見他的蟋蟀時，也不决大吃一驚，她說：</p>
<p>「你那裏捉來這末大的一個？」</p>
<p>「你還不知道麽？在村裏石牌坊那兒。告訴你，那兒的蟋蟀眞是多極了，全是好的。明天我和你一道捉去好麽？最好是剛天亮的時候。」</p>
<p>姑媽跑到房裏拿出那頂好的蟋蟀草來，她很小心的輕輕的將兩隻趕在一過讓牠們面的站着，看上去似乎兩隻都是了不起的英雄。這時姑媽又在他那一隻的庇股上輕輕的搔了幾下，立閟就振着翅膀粗聲的呌了起來，一會兒便衝上前去，而那大頭鬼也不肯退讓，馬上便互相嚙着敵人的頸　子。牠們都熱烈咬着，不要命的咬，這一個退一步那個便乘機進一步。不久大頭鬼跌一個翻身，時敏簡直快樂得什麽似的。可是大頭鬼確是驍勇。翻轉身來又是拼命的咬。大概又支持了半分鐘之久，兩邊都不見輸　，一直到他的那一隻衝過去在大頭鬼的肚上拼命的咬了一下，於是大頭鬼　脚就跑，而這一個便在後面大咸大呌的追。不消說，時敏會高興得跳起來，他呌着說：</p>
<p>「大頭鬼輸了，大頭鬼輸了丨」</p>

<h3>Army and Navy Launch Large-Scale Search for Robbers; Bandit Den Seems to Be in Lijin Territory; British Advisor Arrives in Jinan for Negotiations; Tianjin Japanese Consul Visits Yu Xuezhong; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Attaches Importance to This Case</h3>
<p>(Jinan) It is reported that the pirates who robbed the Shunten Wheel landed at Dayang Estuary, on the border of Hebei and Shandong. The Deputy Consul Mr. Dijuler of the British Embassy and the Deputy Military Advisor Mr. Junruide arrived in Jinan from Beiping, and together with the Deputy British Consul from Qingdao, Mr. Laibo, arrived in Jinan to visit Han Fuju, requesting an immediate investigation. Han replied that he had ordered the coastal county chiefs, garrison troops, and local militias to conduct a strict search, and had reported to the central government. It is reported that the kidnapped include former Minister of Interior Sun Danlin. The Third Fleet has dispatched the warships Tong'an and Zhenhai to patrol the Longkou and Yellow River Estuary areas. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju stated that the British advisor expressed great interest in the Shunten Wheel incident and that he had ordered a strict search. If they have escaped to the province, the case will surely be solved within a few days. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the New Shunten Wheel robbery case, one of the Japanese passengers who was taken away is named Sugimoto. The Tianjin Japanese Consul notified the Hebei Provincial Government this morning, requesting prompt assistance. It is reported that the Qingdao Japanese Consul also notified Han of Shandong, requesting that he devise a way to rescue Sugimoto. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Kurihara, visited Yu Xuezhong, requesting a swift rescue of Yamamoto, the Japanese passenger who was kidnapped from the Shunten Wheel. Yu agreed to take responsibility for the search. The kidnapped Japanese, Yamamoto, is a resident of Tangshan. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, Hebei Province received a telegram from Fan Pujiang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Hebei Coastal Defense, reporting that the location of the Taikoo Shuntien Wheel robbery was at 38 degrees north latitude and 18 degrees 42 minutes east longitude, belonging to Lijin County, Shandong Province, at the Lijin Estuary of the Yellow River, which is not under the jurisdiction of the Commander-in-Chief, so it was impossible to prevent it. The numbers of the sailing ships used by the pirates have been identified as (172), (209), (144), (285), (250). The Coastal Defense Headquarters dispatched five gunboats to search along the Changshan Islands and the Bohai Bay. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The foreign affairs authorities are paying close attention to the Shuntien Wheel robbery case. In addition to sending telegrams to various Shandong provincial agencies to find ways to rescue the victims, they have also telegraphed the Aviation Committee to send airplanes to assist in the investigation, hoping to rescue the kidnapped Chinese and foreign personnel from danger as soon as possible. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The Shuntien Wheel arrived in Qingdao this morning at 7:00 a.m. from Yantai and departed for Shanghai at 11:30 a.m. According to crew members, 25 passengers were kidnapped, including Sun Danlin, a secretary of the National Government Secretariat. The bandits claimed to be former subordinates of Liu Zhennian, retaliating due to the government gunboat suppression. The British Vice-Consul stationed in Qingdao, Mr. Chaipu, went to Jinan on the evening of the 19th to visit Han and request assistance in the rescue. The Third Fleet dispatched the warships Zhenhai and Tong'an to search. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Hebei authorities believe that this Shunten Wheel robbery proves that the pirates possess special navigational skills and that the act was planned. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) It is reported that when the Japanese person kidnapped in the Shunten Wheel case was robbed, he was watching on the deck in a very leisurely manner and later went with the bandits. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to news from Nanjing regarding the Shunten Wheel ship robbery, after receiving the news, the foreign affairs authorities immediately sent telegrams to various Shandong provincial agencies, requesting them to devise ways to rescue the victims. It is now reported that the Weihaiwei Management Office telegraphed that they have consulted with the headquarters of the Third Fleet to swiftly capture and rescue the victims, and have also telegraphed the Haiou stationed on Changshan Island to investigate nearby. The Tong'an and Zhenhai warships in Weihaiwei also set sail one after another on the evening of the 19th and the morning of the 20th to assist in the investigation. (20th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The Shuntien ship arrived here at 6:30 this morning. Mrs. Mr.  Li, the British Consul-General in this port, Mrs. Heqiong, the Deputy Manager of the Tianjin branch of the Asia Petroleum Company, with her two young children, and Esmenge, the police chief of the British Concession in Tianjin, disembarked. The Shuntien ship then departed for Shanghai at 11:30 this morning. Mrs. Li suffered two minor injuries, reportedly inflicted by a robber with the butt of a pistol. The captain of the Shuntien ship and others stated that they were certain that the five civilian boats were not pre-arranged to meet the pirates. At the time, there were many small boats fishing in the shallows, and the pirates only called on five of them, forcing them to approach, and also forcing the crew of the Shuntien ship to help the civilian boats approach. The captain also said that the pirate leader softly expressed a desire to encounter the customs anti-smuggling patrol boat Haixing, so that the Shuntien ship, with its far superior speed, could collide with it. Furthermore, female passenger Mrs. Liermao said that she hid a diamond ring in her hat and banknotes worth one hundred yuan in her socks, thus preserving them. Mrs. Hualun said that she initially refused to open the door to admit the robbers, but later the robbers asked Mrs. Shipelinge to translate their orders for her, so she opened the door of the room, and the robbers took her suitcase to the cargo hold to open and loot the luggage. The captain and others also highly praised the bravery of the female passengers, especially Mrs. Heqiong, who, despite fearing that her two children would be taken by the robbers, maintained a smile throughout. The British Consul in Qingdao, Telaaibai, went to the province to meet Chairman Han to negotiate the case and will return here tomorrow. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin notified the U.S. Embassy today that the Chinese authorities will do their best to assist in the rescue of those kidnapped from the Shunten Wheel. Mr. Tero, an official of the British Embassy, and Military Attache Di Huaduoli departed for Jinan last night to discuss rescue methods with Shandong provincial authorities. The Japanese Embassy stated today that the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin has lodged representations with Yu Xuezhong, demanding that the Chinese authorities investigate the location of the pirate's den. The Japanese Consul-General also lodged representations with Han Fuju, demanding that he devise a way to rescue Yamamoto, the kidnapped Japanese national. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Yantai) The injuries of the third mate of the Shunten Wheel, Mr. Ross, are still very serious. An X-ray examination of the wound on his head this morning determined that it was not a gunshot wound but probably caused by a Mauser pistol. According to reports, when the Shunten Wheel was robbed, Ross was knocked down on the deck by the robbers. It was not until 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning that the pirates saw that Ross was still not dead and asked the captain to rescue him.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Rural Revitalization and Rural Lending</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Rural poverty today is pervasive throughout the country. Any abundant province, with the exception of a very few special areas, deeply feels this kind of poverty. This situation is sufficient to cause the bankruptcy of the entire rural economy. If the rural economy goes bankrupt, there is no reason why the national economy should survive. Currently, because of the rural decline, the national market has fallen into decay. At the same time, large cities are developing abnormally, and rural cash is flocking to the cities and entering a state of dormancy. Even the banks operated by Chinese people have total deposits of nearly 200 million, but the loans issued are probably less than 50%. The rest has become floating capital. If this continues, it will be even more difficult to deal with in the banking sector. In the rural sector, it will be even more difficult to control.</p>
<p>The initial source of this phenomenon is the unrest in inland social order. In the process of transforming the agricultural economy into an industrial economy, rural areas are bound to suffer hardships. Moreover, capitalist countries, stimulated by the world economic panic, regard agricultural countries as markets for the consumption of manufactured goods, and then go a step further and dump their agricultural products. In recent years, foreign wheat flour and rice have been imported into our country, with huge increases. This is clear evidence. Therefore, a year of good harvest actually caused panic due to low grain prices. For example, Shaanxi has experienced years of drought, and many people have been displaced. Once there is a good harvest, they still have difficulty making a living. This proves that my country's rural economy is indeed under the pressure of market relations and is trapped in a difficult situation. Furthermore, the accumulation of rural wealth must be based on strong side businesses, such as silk and tea. In recent times, industrial products have been continuously imported into the inland areas. The ideal economic model of rural self-sufficiency has long been broken. In general, the daily necessities in rural areas, except for food, mostly depend on imports, and agricultural by-products cannot achieve an appropriate balance with imported products. The wealth of rural areas is decreasing day by day, and the prosperity of cities is also difficult to maintain, and the economic crisis is becoming more and more serious.</p>
<p>Therefore, the existing floating capital in Shanghai and other major cities is planned to be returned to the countryside in the form of rural loans, hoping that the countryside will benefit from it and the cities will not suffer from oversaturation. The intention is very good. However, if this kind of lending is not wide in scope and small in number, it is easy to recover, and the bank also feels its benefits. But we must know that today most of the loans of Chinese farmers are used to temporarily alleviate the current urgent needs and cope with the current situation, rather than as a fund for land improvement or other productive undertakings. Then, this kind of loan is still limited to the real interests of the rural area itself and does not help the crisis of the entire national economy. The benefits to the bank capital are even more temporary. The reason for this method is that the farmers, in addition to repaying the loans, still have to find another way to pay the interest. If it can be borrowed at a low interest rate, it will naturally be welcomed by the people, or it can be said to solve the urgent needs for a while. However, it is not enough to talk about rural revitalization.</p>
<p>During this extraordinary period when countries around the world are levying high tariffs, countries like ours suffer significant economic damage. Therefore, the first thing to pay attention to when lending to rural areas today is the development of the entire rural area. The major ones should be decided by the central government and local governments to determine specific policies and stabilize this extraordinary period with a planned method. First, seek the stability of general social order, and at the same time indicate the path of cooperation between cities and rural areas. Then, the effect of credit cooperation can be significant, and the use of funds can be appropriate. After the rural areas are roughly stable, it is necessary to engage in land improvement and the popularization of rural education. Secondly, attention must be paid to the general consumption power of rural areas. If it cannot be actively increased, it will be difficult for urban industries to develop, and the national economy will have no foundation. Therefore, when it comes to revitalizing rural areas today, no matter how it starts, it must be premised on rural industrialization. In other words, it is to revive rural side businesses and actively increase production for rural areas. However, it is almost impossible to build mechanical industries in rural areas suddenly. Therefore, the promotion of household handicrafts and the education of light industry are the initial basis for the recovery of the rural economy. Therefore, rural lending must, on the one hand, promote land improvement and, on the other hand, induce farmers to engage in household handicraft production. Then, the floating capital can truly flow back to the countryside, and the reality of revitalization can be seen.</p>

<h3>Naval Issues: US-Japan Opinions Clash, Japan's Demand for Equality Has Ulterior Motives, Contents of MacDonald and Matsudaira Meeting</h3>
<p>(New York) US Navy Admiral Pratt published an article in the International Current Affairs Magazine today, attacking Japan's demand for equality in naval armaments. Pratt believes that Japan's national security does not require equal strength with the British and American navies because Japan already has a secure defense line, which the UK does not have. As for the United States, it has the defense lines of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Japan only needs to deal with one side and does not need to be equal to the United States. Moreover, in the past 50 years, neither the UK nor the US has indicated any intention to be hostile to Japan. Therefore, Pratt believes that Japan's request is not for peace and must have other ulterior motives. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) And Leto continued, the London Treaty stipulates the equality of submarine tonnage, which not only makes the Japanese islands as solid as rocks but also allows Japan to enter the Asian continent from an island country, as easy as searching for objects. Today, no one can block the Japanese coast. Japan's naval expenses are higher than all government expenses. The situation in the United States is the opposite. Since the Washington Conference in 1922, Japan's naval budget has been five and a half times higher than that of the United States. And Leto believes that if the United States and Japan do not engage in trade wars and can respect each other's treaty rights and obligations, then there is no reason for conflict between the United States and Japan. As for the Manchurian issue, Pratt recognizes that Japan has considerable rights. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Admiral Pratt expressed his personal views on changing Japan's current naval ratio. The Japanese naval authorities stated their intentions as follows: (1) Admiral Pratt said that the Japanese government does not have a theoretical basis for demanding to change the current naval ratio and demand an increase for the British and American countries, but the Washington Treaty was signed 15 years ago, and the current international situation has changed repeatedly, weapons have also been advanced, and Japan's leap forward in national power, and reasons such as these are considered necessary to change. Moreover, the London Treaty is also short-term, so it is agreed to advocate complete renewal from a free position at the next disarmament conference, which has already been stated. (2) Although Japan is not as close to the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as the United States, if the United States fleet concentrates its full strength in the Pacific Ocean, it is considered absolutely necessary to have the naval power to deal with this situation. (3) If war breaks out, Japan will be a neutral country, which is no different from the United Kingdom and the United States, but the establishment of Manchuria is still shallow, and a Japanese-Manchu agreement has been signed, so the responsibility of a neutral country is also extremely important. (4) It is a mistake to think that Japan's finances cannot withstand the naval arms race. It is also possible to choose types of warships that are suitable for the country's prestige and national conditions to enrich armaments. The finances after the abolition of the disarmament treaty will be more generous than now. Even from the perspective of the people's state of mind on armaments, the Admiral's observation is also wrong. (20th Nikkei Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Naval Talks Continue</h3>
<p>(London) The Anglo-American naval talks continued today for approximately two hours. The discussions were of a general nature. The American delegation stated that the progress was quite satisfactory and that the discussions were still in the preliminary stages. They also expressed the hope that at the next meeting, Britain could outline its main proposals. In addition to Italy and Japan accepting Britain's invitation to engage in preliminary discussions with Britain, France has now also accepted. (Reuter's telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Preliminary negotiations for the naval conference have now begun. According to reports from the ambassadors stationed in Britain and the United States to the Foreign Ministry, Britain intends to propose holding a formal conference in London in June of next year. The United States also favors holding the conference in June. Japan has no objections to the British and American proposals regarding the location and timing of this formal conference. (Rengo's telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese naval authorities have virtually finalized their fundamental policy for addressing the naval conference. Japan will proceed with discussions in accordance with the reservation attached by Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki to the London Treaty (that the Japanese government, at the 1935 disarmament conference, would be free to discuss naval issues without any restrictions). The Japanese Navy's proposal aims at national security and advocates for rational principles of disarmament. (Rengo's telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>MacDonald Meets Matsudaira</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) British Prime Minister MacDonald invited Ambassador Matsudaira to his office on the 18th, after the Anglo-American preparatory meeting, for talks.

According to reliable sources, Prime Minister MacDonald expressed his pleasure that both Japan and the United States were willing to participate in the preparatory meeting. He also expressed his hope to advance next year's conference to begin in January. Ambassador Matsudaira reportedly said that Japan believes around April would be suitable for holding the conference, due to preparation and parliamentary considerations. As for the location of the conference, France had not yet responded, so it was not mentioned during the meeting.

<h3>French Foreign Minister Meets Austrian Chancellor - Little Entente Political Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Vienna French Foreign Minister Barthou, en route to the Romanian capital, passed through the Vienna train station tonight.

Barthou reiterated to Dollfuss that France would continue to cooperate with Britain and Italy in accordance with the Anglo-Franco-Italian declaration of February 17th of this year, in order to maintain Austria's independence and seek its economic and financial development. It is certain that the two men will discuss the matter further when they meet in Venice. It is said that according to information from various sources, the results of the Venice meeting will be more psychological than diplomatic. The two men also discussed the terrorist activities of the National Socialist Party in Austria, stating that since the beginning of the Venice meeting, such activities have clearly subsided. In the event that the German National Socialist Party disregards Hitler's guarantee to Mussolini and resumes disturbances in Austria, Austria can always seek assistance from the League of Nations, and France will certainly provide assistance.

<h3>France Divides Air Force Regions</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the National Defense Budget Act was passed by the Chamber of Deputies on the 14th of this month, it was transferred to the Senate for discussion. The chairman and rapporteur of the Senate Air Force Committee both believe that the general organization law of the Air Force, which has been passed by the Chamber of Deputies, is of great importance and needs to be established quickly. When the Senate met tonight, it will pass the bill by a show of hands. According to the provisions of this bill, the entire territory of France will be divided into several air force regions according to the needs of the Air Force, and an aviation school will be established to train air force officers and cadre personnel. It also stipulates mobilization methods and defensive actions. Minister of War General Pétain expressed his opinion, saying that the overall responsibility for coordinating the actions of the army, navy, and air force regarding national defense lies with the Prime Minister and the Higher War Council, so that they can respond to each other. He also said that the Prime Minister's responsibilities are too heavy and should be shared by a special agency. Prime Minister Doumergue said that the supreme command organization during wartime cannot be organized hastily. According to past experience, although the Prime Minister's office was able to overcome difficulties during the Great War, it lacked the necessary methods. He believes that in the future, the Prime Minister should have specialized assistants to provide support. Doumergue concluded that France does not hold grudges and loves peace, and its efforts are only aimed at being able to defend itself when attacked. If all countries were as mindful as France, peace could be ensured. As Congress is about to adjourn, he dared to ask for rapid discussion, so that the government would have sufficient time to engage in the essential work, especially the organization of the Prime Minister's office.

<h3>Romanian King Carol Speaks</h3>
<p>(Paris) A special correspondent for Le Petit Parisien, the evening before French Foreign Minister Barthou visited Bucharest, had an audience with Romanian King Carol. King Carol took the opportunity of the French Foreign Minister's visit to send a message to the French people, reiterating the friendly relations between the two countries. When King Carol received the French newspaper reporter, he denied the rumors of his abdication, but he was vague about whether he intended to rebuild the dictatorship, only saying that various countries are placing great hopes on authoritarian governments. Romania will adhere to the parliamentary system to the end, but words and deeds that corrupt public morals and cause political strife will have no place. The King went on to say that he appointed Tatarescu as Prime Minister because he is the most suitable person to govern the country at present. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>

<h3>Disarmament Committee Discusses Sanctions and Control of Arms</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Three committees of the Disarmament Conference met today. (1) The Supervision and Treaty Implementation Guarantee Committee used the arguments listed in the French memorandum as the basis for discussion, and will categorize violations of the treaty according to their severity, and formulate corresponding sanctions. (2) In the Arms Manufacturing and Trade Committee, the American delegation proposed a plan, advocating that each country's government be responsible for the weapons and ammunition manufactured within its borders, and advocating the establishment of a standing committee to which orders placed by foreign countries for weapons should be copied and filed, along with export licenses. The American proposal is worthy of our attention, because the United States used to support Britain, Germany, Japan, and Italy, and oppose France's arguments. The plan proposed today is more advanced than the 1925 Geneva Convention on Arms Sales, and almost completely satisfies France. The British side also tends to agree. (3) The Security Committee discussed whether to conclude a European convention to supplement Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, and at the same time considered whether to conclude regional mutual assistance conventions based on the Locarno Treaty and the Balkan Pact. However, these conventions should be compatible with the provisions of general disarmament conventions. Everyone was sincere during the discussion, which is a situation that has not been seen at the Disarmament Conference for a long time. (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The US representative today proposed to the Committee on the Control of Arms Manufacture and Sale that all countries should be responsible for the arms and ammunition manufactured within their countries, and that all orders and export passports should be sent in duplicate to the Permanent Disarmament Committee for record. Representatives from Japan and Czechoslovakia said at the time that they could not discuss the proposal, but the French representative supported it. The proposal is in line with British Prime Minister MacDonald's plan, but it goes a step further by requiring that orders also be sent to the committee. (Reuter's Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>International PEN Club Decides to Fight for Freedom of Speech - Political Pressure Destroys Intellectual Progress - Representatives from Various Countries Express Outrage</h3>
<p>(London) The International PEN Club Conference held its first meeting in Edinburgh today. Scientists and writers gathered together. Today, it was decided that the fight for freedom of speech must continue until interference by those who violate progress and the spirit of thought is removed. Among those who strongly support freedom of speech are H.G. Wells, Ernst Toller, Mrs. Meloney (a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune), and Mr. Lyndward. Mr. Wells gave a keynote address, saying (Since both literature and science want to transcend politics, why do politicians and military police want to interfere in literature and science? Once politics gains power and infringes on the freedom of literature and human thought and speech, we have to pay attention to politics.) Next, the German exile writer Ernst Toller recounted to the audience the various restrictions faced by German writers today. He said (Many of my friends, all over fifty years old, have been imprisoned for more than seventeen months without trial. They are in prison and have to do manual labor that they are completely unaccustomed to. The German government's will is certainly to seek revenge and to oppose the spirit of freedom.) Next, Mrs. Meloney spoke, saying that the American people's struggle for freedom of publication today is not a new action, but in fact this struggle has never slackened since the American Revolution. Mrs. Meloney also recounted past events to prove her point, such as the attempt by the Tweed Ring in New York in 1870 to ban free speech, and the imprisonment last year of a reporter from a Louisville railroad station for refusing to reveal the name of the correspondent who criticized the Kentucky legislature. Mrs. Meloney concluded by saying (This battle has been going on for a long time, and victory can only be won with indomitable spirit.) Only one motion was proposed at today's meeting, proposed by British novelist Lyndward, as follows:</p>
<p>(The PEN Club Federation upholds freedom of speech throughout the world, and is deeply concerned about the continued attempts to infringe upon this freedom in the name of social security and international strategy, and believes that in order to promote the world's progress towards a higher and more organized political and economic order, it is necessary to freely criticize governments and systems when necessary, which is absolutely essential from all points of view.) (Special Telegram from the North China Daily News, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The International PEN Club held a conference here, and an intense incident almost occurred today. The Italian representative Marinetti told the audience that (Italy not only welcomes pan-system scholars, but also welcomes others who sympathize with the pan-system system but do not actively support it.) Then, Belgian representative and socialist writer Peyella stood up and ridiculed him, saying (We all know that the Italian people are as docile as lambs, and other countries are full of tigers and wolves, but Italy has none.) Peyella also cited the fact that the residence of Italian writer Croce was raided by the police and all the books were confiscated as evidence. The Italian representative was furious when he heard this, threatening Peyella and almost exchanging blows. Fortunately, the chairman tried his best to dissuade them, and the fight was avoided.

<h3>Roosevelt Approves Silver Act - Authorizes Government to Purchase Domestic and Foreign Silver - Silver Reserves to be Maintained at 25 Percent</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt approved the Silver Act today. This act was proposed by the Silver Bloc in the Senate, aimed at saving silver. It was passed by the House of Representatives on June 1st and by the Senate on June 11th. This act stipulates increasing the US silver reserves, allowing the President to receive domestic currency silver reserves, and allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to sell silver when the silver price exceeds the currency value or when the currency ratio exceeds three parts gold to one part silver, at a price he deems most beneficial to the public interest, limited to 50 cents per ounce. It also allows the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates, the face value of which shall not be lower than the cost of the silver purchased. The act also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to manage, investigate, and prohibit the purchase, import, and transfer of silver, and violators may be fined $10,000 or imprisoned for up to ten years. The Secretary of the Treasury may also issue regulations that he deems necessary to implement this act. (Reuter's Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Silver Tax Regulations Promulgated</h3>
<p>(Washington) When President Roosevelt signed the Silver Act today, he invited Senators Pittman and Dafoe and Representatives King and Dies to the White House to attend the ceremony of approving this act. At the same time, Internal Revenue Commissioner Helvering promulgated the regulations for the silver bullion profits transfer tax in order to implement the purpose of the silver purchase act. These regulations stipulate (1) The transfer of silver bullion profits, where the sale price exceeds the cost and expenses, is subject to tax. (2) Transfers within the scope of taxation include transactions completed outside the United States, as long as one party to the transaction is a resident of the United States, or a citizen of the United States, who resides in the United States for three months at the time of the transfer, or the silver bullion profits being transferred are in the United States when the transfer is completed or agreed upon. (3) Transfers completed on or after May 15, 1934, are subject to tax. Transfers completed before 9 p.m. on June 19 and those completed after that are governed by separate articles. (4) Transfers of silver to the US government are also subject to tax, except for (A) storage or delivery to the US Mint in accordance with the proclamation of December 21, 1933, regarding the coinage of domestically newly mined silver, or in accordance with the President's similar proclamation, and (B) any executive order promulgated in the future in accordance with Article 7 of the Silver Act. (5) The silver tax is 50 percent of the net profit. The net profit is the amount by which the sale price of the transferred silver bullion exceeds the cost and expenses. (A) The sale price refers to the amount of money and the market value of other assets received directly or indirectly in the transfer of silver. (B) The cost refers to the amount of money paid by the transferor or the market value of other assets, in exchange for this benefit. (C) Expenses include warehouse rent, insurance, freight, and handling fees, but not interest, taxes, and payments. (6) Both parties in the transfer are responsible for stamp tax, except for those transferred to the US government or those whose responsibility is borne by the transferor for transfers before 9 p.m. tonight. The transferee's obligation ceases when the tax collector cancels the stamp. (7) The transferor must file a report before July 18 on his silver bullion profits from January 15, 1934, to the date of implementation of this act. (8) After this act is implemented, if the transferor transfers his silver bullion profits, he must issue a sworn statement, stating the various details of the transaction, and hand it over to the transferee. This statement must then be forwarded to the tax collector of the Internal Revenue Service. If this transfer is subject to taxation, a stamp must be affixed before this statement is handed over. (5) Taxes may be reduced or exempted in the following circumstances: (A) The profits are obtained by the transferor in the course of his ordinary business, or for industrial and artistic purposes. (B) The profits obtained from silver arbitrage to protect foreign exchange transactions are offset by the losses in their foreign exchange transactions. (Reuter's Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Eastern European Locarno - Russian and German Ambassadors Resign Due to Failure</h3>
<p>(Berlin) It was learned from reliable sources tonight that the failure of the Eastern Locarno Pact has led to the resignation of two ambassadors, one being the Soviet Russian Ambassador to Germany, Khinchuk, and the other being the German Ambassador to Russia, Nadolny. The two men were the originators of this pact. After lengthy negotiations, the two men drafted an agreement, which was first submitted to the German government, hoping to promote economic and political coordination between Germany and Russia. The most prominent development after this was the widely circulated rapprochement between France and Russia, which caused a cooling of relations between Germany and Russia, causing the Eastern Locarno Pact to become a bubble. Khinchuk resigned first, and Nadolny resigned later. Nadolny was even more embarrassed, because Germany even refused to discuss Litvinov's proposal when he passed through Germany on May 30. It is now known that Foreign Minister Neurath did not object to the agreement, but Chancellor Hitler rejected it. (National Telegraph, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to Le Petit Parisien, the French government has recently approached the German and Polish governments, separately, to request that the two governments give sympathetic consideration to the draft convention recently negotiated by the three Baltic countries. This draft convention is a political and economic convention, similar in nature to the conventions of the Little Entente countries. According to European local conventions, the Rhine Security Pact has been concluded in Western Europe, and the Balkan Entente Pact has been concluded in Southern Europe. If a Baltic States Convention is added, the countries of the European continent can be linked together to form a chain. If so, under a system of common security, the realization of equal rights will be possible. Since all countries have equal security guarantees, Germany can return to Geneva, and the Disarmament Conference can also succeed. Le Petit Parisien also said that the French government's initiative seems likely to gain the sincere support of the British government. (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>German Political Tide Recedes</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Vice-Chancellor Papen gave a speech at the University of Marburg the other day, slandering German domestic politics, which led to a conflict with Propaganda Minister Goebbels. It is now reported that Goebbels and Papen have met, and their opinions seem to have been dispelled. Hitler did not want a split within the government and strongly advised Papen not to deliver his Sunday speech. Papen has already agreed. However, rumors are circulating today that Papen, Foreign Minister Neurath, and Finance Minister Kroesigk have resigned. The occurrence of such news shows that Papen's speech and the prohibition of its publication have caused public opinion to be turbulent and uneasy. (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Polish-Lithuanian Relations Approach - Former Polish Prime Minister Yulitsky Takes on Important Political Mission</h3>
<p>Riga According to Lithuanian newspapers, former Polish Prime Minister Prystor has recently come to the Lithuanian capital. Prystor is a close confidant of Polish Minister of Military Affairs General Pilsudski and recently participated with Pilsudski in negotiations between Lithuania and Poland. In the Lithuanian capital, it is generally believed that Prystor's visit, although ostensibly a private trip, is actually carrying a political mission. (It is said that Lithuania previously had disagreements with Poland because its city of Vilnius was occupied by Poland. Recently, due to Soviet Russia's mediation, the two countries have negotiated in order to resolve the issue and to negotiate a non-aggression pact among the Baltic countries. Poland and Lithuania have gradually become closer. The mission carried by Prystor may refer to this.) (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Russia Joins the League of Nations - Switzerland Does Not Support</h3>
<p>Berne Today, the parliament discussed the relationship between Switzerland and Soviet Russia. Swiss Vice-Chairman Ilgen declared that Switzerland does not want to support Soviet Russia's joining the League of Nations, nor does it want to allow Soviet Russia to obtain a permanent seat on the Council of the League of Nations. Chairman Matte said that the issue will soon be dealt with by the government, but he does not want to change his attitude. (National Press Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Russia Establishes "Parents' University" - Teaching Methods of Raising Children - Enrollment is Very Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russia will soon establish a so-called "Parents' University" in Nizhny Novgorod. This university is truly an innovative educational institution in the world, and its purpose is to educate parents in general, so that they know how to raise their children, and to instill communist doctrines into the hearts of older people. The school's teaching time is chosen on Sundays and other holidays, so that there is time to enroll, and it is heard that the number of applicants has already reached 600, even though the authorities only hoped that 150 people would enroll.

<h3>International Clearing Bank Protests Germany's Suspension of Debt - Points to Destruction of Obligations - Urges Reconsideration</h3>
<p>Basel, Switzerland The Bank for International Settlements announced that the representatives of the 1924 Dawes Loan recently lodged a strong protest with German Finance Minister Clausner regarding Germany's announcement of the suspension of interest and principal payments on foreign debt, saying that if this action is implemented, it will violate obligations and asking the German government to consider the matter at length, adding that the Dawes Loan representatives firmly stated that they reserve all rights granted by the loan.

<h3>National Labour Conference Suspends Discussion - 40-Hour Work Week</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labour Conference was in chaos this afternoon. When the discussion on the 40-hour work week began, the situation suddenly became tense. Only nine countries voted on the first clause of the bill. The remaining clauses of the bill were therefore not put to discussion. China, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway voted in favor, while Britain, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg voted against. Many employer and worker representatives did not vote. Afterwards, the chairman stood up and declared that the number of representatives present was less than the legal two-thirds quorum and should adjourn. Later, representatives from various factions held informal meetings, and the government representatives decided to propose suspending the discussion of the 40-hour work week.

<h3>Ceylon Postpones Boycott of Japanese Goods - Authorities Explain Reasons</h3>
<p>Colombo Today, the Ceylon authorities explained the reasons for delaying the implementation of quotas on Japanese goods, saying that the government had received a plan from the Colonial Office to guide the matter. However, the Ceylon government had previously telegraphed the British government, asking for a guarantee of preferential treatment for Ceylon's cocoa and lead in the British market. Before the reply is received, consideration of the Colonial Office's plan will be postponed, hence the delay. (Reuter's Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Arctic Expedition Team Survives and Returns to Moscow, Receiving Grand Welcome from the Masses</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today, when the members of the Chliuskin expedition team and the brave aviators who rescued them from the Arctic ice arrived here, crowds gathered in Red Square to give them a grand welcome. The cars carrying the team members were adorned with flowers. A woman sat in one of them, holding a baby who was born on the Chliuskin icebreaker. The crowd became even more excited and cheered upon seeing it. Stalin and Professor Schmidt, the leader of the expedition team, delivered speeches successively. Then the entire team reviewed 10,000 soldiers, followed by 250,000 civilians, each carrying miniature ice floes and airplane formations, marching past the team members. The Soviet large aircraft, the "Maxim Gorky," also flew over Moscow for the first time to add to the grandeur. It is reported that when the Chliuskin was exploring the Arctic Ocean, it sank near Wrangel Island in the Siberian Arctic Sea on February 13. More than a hundred team members, including men, women, and children, were stranded on the ice floe. Later, airplanes rescued six or seven people each time. The last six people were rescued on April 13, exactly two months after the shipwreck. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Recent Economic Situation in France (Paris Correspondence) Cash Increase, Continued Unemployment, Economic Retrenchment, Budget Balance</h3>
<p>In recent years, France has faced a very difficult situation internationally. Since Germany put forward demands for military equality, the authorities have felt even more uneasy, deeply fearing that if the Germans, armed with their modern scientific weapons and employing their militaristic organization, were to provoke France, the outcome would be unpredictable. Therefore, France on the one hand is still trying its best to negotiate with Britain to prevent future disarmament conferences from completely breaking down. On the other hand, it is also courting the Soviet Union to reduce Germany's powerful allies. If the Soviet Union can join the League of Nations, the life of the endangered League can be extended for some time. However, the French still believe that relying solely on diplomatic maneuvering is not enough to stabilize their hegemony in Europe. Therefore, they pay close attention to their own economic leadership position.</p>
<p>The so-called economic leadership is none other than the consolidation of the French gold standard system and the soundness of cash reserves. France refuses to abandon the gold standard. The internal reason is that it has suffered a severe lesson from wartime inflation. The external reason is to maintain its hegemonic position in the European financial world, but this has also caused another adverse phenomenon, that is, goods from countries with lower international exchange rates flow into France en masse due to their lower prices. France's own industries and agriculture are both threatened, so it must rise up to protect itself. Needless to say, the method of protection is to strengthen the quota system and strive to minimize the import surplus. As a result, the excess of imports has indeed decreased, but countries with trade relations with France have also exercised the same retaliatory policies on French goods. As a result, French exports have also gradually decreased. Last April, French exports amounted to 1,501 million francs, while this year during the same period, they decreased to 1,470 million francs. Imports last April were 2,477 million francs, while this year during the same period, they decreased to 2,005 million francs. If we calculate from January to April of this year and compare the cumulative total with the first four months of last year, imports decreased by 154.7 million francs, and exports decreased by 57 million francs. From the perspective of imports, this can be said to be an improvement, but it is not a positive measure.</p>
<p>We can understand that this improvement in imports is of little benefit to the economy by examining the French industrial production index. Now, using 1913 as the baseline, the total French industrial production index was 106 in both January and February of this year, but fell to 105 in March. Industries such as mining, construction, and leather are all declining. At a time when the industrial production indices of Britain, the United States, and Germany are increasing, France alone is trending downward. What a recession this is.</p>
<p>Because French industry is sluggish, the number of unemployed people is also increasing. Last September, France (excluding the Soviet Union) had the fewest unemployed workers among the major European countries. At the end of that month, there were only 267,000 people. By the end of last year, this had increased to 312,000 people. By mid-March of this year, it had further increased to 349,000 people. In April, it increased slightly again to 350,000 people, an increase of 30,000 people compared to the same period last year. Although the situation is not that alarming, it is enough to prove the deterioration of the French economic situation.</p>
<p>When the government budget was established in early February of this year, it estimated that the shortfall in revenue was about 400 million francs. However, as a result of the increase in fiscal credit and the austerity order in April, which saved government spending, the national treasury revenue in March relatively increased. If this trend can continue, it is not impossible for the fiscal budget for this year to be balanced.</p>
<p>Because France's fiscal credit has increased, the funds that flowed out have flowed back, and the cash stored in vaults has gradually appeared on the market. The amount of cash held by the Bank of France has gradually increased. In March of this year, there were only 73.98 billion francs, at which point the French gold standard was almost unsustainable. By mid-April, it had increased to 74.978 billion francs, and by early May, it had increased to 76.177 billion francs. Judging solely from the cash situation, it is gradually stabilizing, but it is necessary to observe the situation in Germany and other gold standard countries before judging whether France can support the gold standard and its current superior position in the long term.

<h3>Through Train Service Between Beiping and Shenyang Technical Issues Awaiting Discussion, Chinese and Japanese Sides Hold Preparatory Meeting in Tianjin, Huang Fu Will Return to Beiping First to Resolve the Through Train Issue</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The issue of through train service between Beiping and Shenyang has been rumored for a long time. Currently, negotiations between China and Japan are gradually approaching. After Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, returned to Tianjin, he immediately began preparations for implementation in Tianjin. Although the principle has been decided, there are still various technical issues regarding implementation that need to be carefully discussed with all parties concerned. He has already invited representatives from the Japanese International Tourism Bureau, the South Manchuria Railway Company, and the puppet Fengshan Railway Bureau, as well as Chen Xiangtao, General Manager of the China Travel Service, and technicians from the Beining Railway Bureau, to hold a preparatory meeting in Tianjin within the next week to make a final concrete decision. After everything is negotiated, international travel agencies will be established in Beiping, Tianjin, Shanhaiguan and other places, and the entire through train service plan will be announced. It has recently been rumored in Beiping that Yin Tong has secretly come to Beiping. It is now learned that Yin is busy contacting all parties concerned in Tianjin for the aforementioned matters and has not yet left for Beiping. He must wait until things are slightly organized before he can come to Beiping to report the progress to the highest military authorities and then return to Tianjin to continue preparations.</p>
<p>Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, sent a telegram to Beiping today (the 19th), stating that he is currently waiting for Chiang in Shanghai. If Chiang does not go to Shanghai or Hangzhou, Huang will go to Nanjing within a few days to meet with him, and then return north, with a deadline of within a week. It is heard that after Huang Fu returns north, he will continue to implement the Central Government's established policy on Sino-Japanese diplomacy and gradually proceed to resolve the through train issue first. As for the postal service issue, it is still under consideration. (19th)</p>

<h3>Taiwan Air Defense Exercise Taipei and Hsinchu Selected as Exercise Sites, Keelung Military Port Also Conducting Special Exercises</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Recently, there have been rumors that Japan has taken action against South China, especially against Fujian, but these rumors are not entirely accurate. However, Taiwan is extremely tense, as if a major war is about to break out. According to recent news from Taiwan, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office is making urgent preparations for wartime. The Taiwan Governor-General, Nakagawa, returned to Taiwan on the 9th of this month after returning to Japan for instructions. He immediately scheduled a large-scale air defense exercise for the two major cities of Taipei (Taiwan's largest metropolis and the seat of the Taiwan Governor-General) and Hsinchu on the 24th of this month. That day was originally the 13th day of the lunar May, commonly known as the City God's birthday. Taipei and Hsinchu usually have parades and floats for welcoming the gods. Therefore, it was changed to the 23rd day of the lunar May (July 4th). This air defense exercise is extremely large in scale, and all of Taiwan's air force squadrons will be mobilized to participate. The hypothetical enemies are the United States, Russia, and China, and they will practice actual offensive and defensive warfare. At that time, the lights in Taipei, Hsinchu, and the surrounding areas will all be turned off. In advance, the Governor-General's Office ordered the people in the territory to each prepare a towel, a basin of cold water, and purchase a gas mask. During the exercise, all doors, windows, and fans must be closed to prevent the invasion of poison gas. It is said that during the air raid drills, poison gas and poisonous gas will be released, and dummy rubber bombs will be thrown. At the same time, the Keelung military port northeast of Taipei will also conduct the same exercise, with the navy participating in special exercises. Preparations have been made a week in advance. On the 16th, ten shelters were built in front of the City Hall, the headquarters of the Defense Corps, and a model gas defense facility was completed in front of the Navy Headquarters, resembling an actual combat situation. In addition, students, workers, merchants, and farmers throughout Taiwan are all saving cash in preparation for a kind of war. According to a Taiwan newspaper report (on the Navy Memorial Day (i.e., the anniversary of Togo's death), Military Attaché Inoue gave a speech on Japan's national power. Afterwards, a Taiwanese islander visited Inoue's residence and anonymously donated 50 yuan for national defense expenses, which was promoted in all aspects. On the 16th, an anonymous person visited Military Attaché Inoue, and because Inoue was not at home, he told his wife that he wanted to celebrate the anniversary of the start of administration and left two packages of national defense donations. Mr. Inoue was very grateful for the sincerity of the anonymous person, and at this critical time for the country, the national consciousness among the islanders suddenly arose, which is very gratifying. The Secretary-General of the Governor-General's Office was also very grateful, saying that he would work hard to live up to their expectations). This is a record from the Taiwan Daily News. The truth of the matter is unknown, but it is clear that the Daily News is vigorously promoting this anonymous donation in the hope of inspiring the Taiwanese people's confidence in the Japanese government. Also, some time ago, there was a widespread rumor in Taiwan that dozens of warships suddenly broke through the Penghu naval fortress. When the warships passed by, the fortress's artillery tried to stop them by raising flags, but they did not listen and passed by with their flags covered. It was not clear what country's warships they were, so they were not shelled. After an investigation, it was learned that they were the warships of a certain country. However, this matter has not been officially announced, and it is not known whether the facts are true or whether it is a deliberate attempt to mislead the public. In addition, starting from June 1, the procedures for Taiwanese people to obtain passports to China have been relaxed and simplified. The Taiwan government has also established measures to provide financial assistance to Taiwanese people who go to the Northeast and Fujian. As for the Five-Leader Conference for the opposite shore (Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou) convened by the Taiwan Governor-General, which was originally scheduled to be held from June 14 to 16, it has now been postponed to mid-July.

The bandit troops in Jinshan Wanyuan City moved towards Zhao Jiaxi. At the same time, Chen Lanting's troops feigned an attack on Zhongchangpo and Hanjiachang, destroying the first and second lines of obstacles in the bandit阵。</p>
<h3>Bandit Leader Zhu De Arrives in Changting | Planning a Final Desperate Struggle |</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After the Eastern Route Army recovered Liancheng, it advanced on Changting. The Red bandits' nest, Ruijin, was shaken. According to those who escaped from Changting a few days ago and arrived in Zhangzhou via Longyan, the bandit leader Zhu De came to Changting from Ruijin on May 19, leading a guard of 2,000 to 3,000 people, carrying four or five machine guns and more than 20 Mauser pistols, stationed at Dabu (the territory of the puppet Fujian Military Region) ten miles away from the city. He immediately convened a mass meeting and lectured to the people, saying, "The situation is urgent at the front. Regardless of whether they are men or women, those between the ages of sixteen and fifty must be conscripted into the Red Army for a final battle of life and death." He carried out forced conscription, and those between the ages of sixteen and forty were organized into formal bandit troops and transferred to the front lines. Those over forty years of age and women were organized into reserve teams and took on rear tasks, with Yangquan and Pai in the area between Dabu and Changting Ruijin as the centralized training grounds. After the National Army recovered Liancheng, many Red bandits fled back to Changting, and Zhu De more actively drafted and trained soldiers. Recently, he drafted 20,000 people, but none of them had firearms. Each person was only given spears, knives, and halberds. They will be trained and sent to the area between Ting and Lian in a short period of time to be used as the vanguard of the formal bandit army, in effect using them as cannon fodder. Under his iron fist, the people of Ting could only bow their heads and obey. Those who showed a little unwillingness had propaganda teams paste posters with the words "Shameful" in front of their doors. Those who refused to be conscripted were considered reactionary. As a result, many people in Ting took the opportunity to flee far away. There is very little food left in the bandit area. The remaining bandits in Changting and Ninghua can only eat porridge once a day. Ammunition is also in short supply, with each gun only getting 30 rounds. The total number of remaining bandits in the puppet 13579 Army Corps is only over 30,000. When the two columns of the 90th Division of the National Army in northern Fujian surrounded Ninghua, Mingxi, and Qingliu, the bandits once divided their troops and attempted to flee to Shaxian and Yongan, but were intercepted by the two divisions of Chen Mingren and Liu Heding and fled back to Changting. Currently, in addition to some bandits in Mingxi and Qingliu and a small number scattered between Ming, Qing, and Yong, most of the bandits' main force is concentrated in Ninghua and Changting, especially in Changting. They have also built defensive fortifications in Tingbian, Hetian, and Sanzhou, hoping to fight a desperate struggle when the National Army attacks Changting.</p>
<p>After the National Army recovered Liancheng, Commander Li Yannian immediately stationed himself in the county seat, and the Political Training Department of the 9th Division was in Liancheng, actively handling the aftermath. Since the 3rd, more than 400 Red bandits in Liancheng have surrendered to the Political Training Department, and the number is still increasing. Ding Guobao, Director of the Political Training Department, summoned the surrenders on the 11th to speak to them, encouraging them to completely awaken. On the 10th, more than 100 refugees from Ninghua fled to Liancheng, and the Political Training Department also provided them with accommodation and relief. On the 12th, Ding summoned the Baojia chiefs to organize the Baojia. (June 15)</p>

<h3>Methods for Leasing Mongolian Land</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>On the 27th at 2:00 AM, the sky in Yun was clear. Starting from Da Jing, a few cold stars accompanied the moon as it slanted westward. The hooting of owls created a desolate scene. It was a time when the wind had ceased, the rain had stopped, and the air was cold enough to freeze the river. Fur clothing felt inadequate to keep warm, so walking was used to increase body temperature. A cavalry escort dispatched by the firewood road protection team, named An Ziye, also dismounted to chat. An was a Mongolian who could speak Chinese but was illiterate. His father, An Kubulu, had served as a battalion commander. His elder brother, An Sheng Nanmu, currently serves as a squad leader in the same battalion as An. An had only been married for two months. When asked (how much dowry was given to the bride's family during the wedding), he replied (Mongolian wedding ceremonies are similar to those of the Han Chinese, but the wealth of families varies greatly. I gave two cows and two horses, eight sheep, and ten pieces of robe material (including six pieces of machine-woven cloth and four pieces of twill cloth), eighty silver dollars, and a bride's hat costing ten dollars. The bride's hat, called "Duo Yi Ma La" in Mongolian, is the most important ornament in the bride's life. In aristocratic and wealthy families, it is inlaid with pearls and jade, costing up to a thousand dollars. The bride's father gifted two men's hats, clothing, shoes, and handkerchiefs, four of each). When further asked (about the ceremony), An changed the subject.</p>
<p>As the moon set and darkness fell, the path became indistinguishable. Occasionally, small stones would strike the feet. Upon inspection at dawn, they were multicolored and dazzling. Picking up a handful, they felt similar to those produced at Yuhua Terrace. However, those that were transparent like crystal and emerald green like jade were far superior to Yuhua stones. When asked about the place name, the answer was "White Stone Gully." "Cai Shi" means "colored stone," "Bai Shi" means "white stone," and "Gou" means "gully." The land, blessed with spiritual energy, was excessively wronged. After fifty li, the camels were unloaded for a rest at a place called Ban Jia Niao Su, which is the upper reaches of White Stone Gully. On the sandy beach, there were many newly dead fish and shrimp, likely swept up from the river by the violent storm last night. Continuing after the rest, the clear sky was suddenly covered by clouds, and heavy snow fell for about half an hour. As the sun reappeared, the snow melted, and it was still easy to walk on the sandy ground. However, the river sometimes flowed secretly under the sand and sometimes overflowed onto the road. Winding around and crossing it was quite time-consuming. Twenty li away was Baotai Temple. The route went up a slope, and the river source also dried up from here. Thirty li to the lodging at (Ge Die Gai), it was already midnight. The morning and evening journey totaled a hundred li. From Baotai Temple to Ge Die Gai, the ground was flat and the soil was loose. Plowing with a hoe would immediately create natural farmland. In 1928, there was a severe drought, and many livestock starved to death. The Huang Gai (Mongolian banner name, bordering Dala banner) Wangfu planned to change from grazing to farming. Land was allocated according to aristocratic rank and Mongolian population, and they were ordered to cultivate it themselves to achieve this goal. However, due to the difficulty of changing customs, few Mongolians cultivated the land themselves. People from Shanxi and Shaanxi migrated here, and the number of people renting land through introductions increased daily. The area of cultivated land nearby also increased day by day. However, Mongolians did not allow formal deeds to be made. The Huang Gai Wangfu maintained four hundred cavalry, who were well-trained and had good weapons. Yang Hou Xiao had occupied Sui Xi for several years, and the Dala banner had been ravaged, but they dared not cross the boundary into Huang Gai. Moreover, Mongolian law was extremely strict against theft, and it was said that no one picked up lost items (Mongolian property was cattle and sheep, which were not easy to steal). Now that land was open for lease, many were happy to rent it for cultivation. The methods for leasing land are as follows: (1) Directly request land from the Wangfu. The land is not measured in acres. As long as one's strength allows and no one else is cultivating it, one can freely expand the cultivation. Regardless of whether the harvest is good or bad, it is divided fairly according to the standard of the Wangfu receiving 30% and the cultivator receiving 70%. (2) With an introduction, if one learns that a certain piece of land belongs to a certain aristocrat or Mongolian, one can also rent it directly from that aristocrat or Mongolian according to the above method. However, one must prepare small gifts in advance, such as tea bricks and mutton, as an introduction to hope for success. If sending gifts to the Wangfu, a whole sheep is most pleasing. (3) Uncultivated mountains and wilderness can also be cultivated first. If someone investigates, quickly send a small gift and then negotiate the rent, which will resolve the matter. (4) For borrowing land to build houses, whether it is one or several, the annual rent is seven yuan. For a pair of oxen for plowing, the annual tax is three and a half dou of millet. For pigs, regardless of size, each head pays one yuan. For sheep, 100 are taken from 2, and 50 are taken from 1. A large mill pays five yuan, and a watermill pays nine yuan. All are collected by soldiers dispatched by the Wangfu. Collecting rent is called "Qi Hai." Tenants must also send water gifts to win over the soldiers and seek continued lease. It is said that renting Mongolian land also requires paying rent and taxes, but compared to the interior, the burden is much lighter. Therefore, all people from the interior who flee to the grasslands to farm are in a state of enjoyment and do not think of returning. However, when they are old and die, their descendants fear the ridicule of their fellow villagers and spare no expense to transport the coffin thousands of miles to bury it in their ancestral lands. This kind of prejudice is too pedantic.</p>
<p>An ordinary acre of land can yield forty dan of millet, but there is no way to transport and sell it. People and livestock eat it together. Cloth and groceries are purchased by selling wool and sheepskin. Prices are very low. One dan of millet costs less than two yuan. Mutton is ten jin per yuan, pork is five jin, chickens are two or three per yuan, sesame oil is ten jin per yuan, and salt is twenty-eight jin per yuan. The salt lake is more than a hundred li away and is a natural crystalline body. Mongolians scoop it from the lake to trade for tea and rice. Han Chinese can visit but cannot take any salt.</p>
<p>On the 28th, the camels were released in the morning. At 2:00 PM, we set off from Ge Die Gai. The route was mostly fertile land with abundant grass and water, suitable for both animal husbandry and cultivation. Three or four camel caravans came towards us, carrying goods. Wool accounted for 40%, sheepskin for 10%, tallow for 20%, and empty loads for 30%. Tallow merchants mostly rode horses or mules in groups of three or five, traveling day and night to catch a good price. The escort soldier, An Baozi, was originally supposed to escort us for two more stations. However, he suddenly requested to return midway and demanded a reward of five yuan from the passengers and donkey drivers. The reporter initially thought there might be dangerous terrain ahead, so he retreated in a hurry. Later, it was learned that a newly arrived tobacco merchant had offered him a large sum of money to escort him back. The monthly salary for soldiers in the road protection team was only two yuan, and even the camp commander only received twelve yuan. Previously, in places like Da Shu Wan and Chai Deng, we saw officers and soldiers of the team gambling and smoking opium in shops, spending extravagantly. Now we know that the source of their income was this. No wonder the donkey drivers pleaded (not to send escorts) but were unsuccessful. At night, the moonlight was like a painting, and the grass was so deep that it covered the abdomen, verdant and lovely. After walking forty or fifty li, not a single house was seen. Only a sandy ridge as thick as a chair had two oxen chewing grass, with a large cart parked beside it and someone lying on it. Later, we arrived at (Shui Zi) and stopped to unload the camels. The day's journey was seventy li. There were no houses here either, but the grass was suitable for grazing, and the water was suitable for drinking. A spring gushed out of the flat ground, so clear that one could count the fish. The stream varied in depth, and the sandy banks were easily eroded. A lamb and a calf were immersed in the water, probably having fallen and drowned while drinking.</p>
<p>When traveling on the grasslands, in addition to preparing food, bedding (a military cot is needed to avoid sleeping on damp ground), lamps, candles, and rain gear, one must also bring copper coins and silver dollars for emergencies. Paper money and small bills are said to be (never seen) and refused. Once, when borrowing a village stove to bake cakes, a small fire fee was offered. A silver dollar could not be exchanged throughout the village. Eggs and wild potatoes were often used as compensation, but they were difficult to carry. Also, in all the places visited, whether inhabited by Han or Mongolians, people repeatedly asked for white sugar and medicines like Rendan, citing illness as the reason. Tea and sugar are the most valuable gifts to give. It is a pity that we did not bring more.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry in Puyuan, Zhejiang - Correspondence Practice for Newspaper Correspondents</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Production Only One-Tenth of What It Used to Be</p>
<p>Most Weaving Machines Idle and Operators Unemployed</p>
<p>Puyuan Town in Zhejiang Province, located between Jiaxing and Tongxiang counties, has long been famous for its silk production and has a long history. During its prosperous period from 1912 to 1923, the town had thousands of weaving machines, and the commercial market was thriving. There were forty or fifty silk and satin shops, hence the saying "thousands of households weaving" and "ten thousand bolts of silk produced daily." However, in the past ten years, on the one hand, it has suffered from international economic aggression and the import of rayon, which competed with local silk. On the other hand, domestic natural disasters and man-made calamities have led to rural bankruptcy. Affected by this, the silk industry in Puyuan has plummeted. In addition, due to the shortage of capital in the silk weaving industry, business policies have not been improved. Weavers stick to outdated methods, and the quality of products is uneven. Because of simplicity and crudeness, they are not up-to-date, fall behind others, and sales channels become narrower and prices become lower. During the Shanghai Incident two years ago, sales in Puyuan were even more hindered, and inventories accumulated, leading to the cessation of weaving. More than half of the silk and satin shops suffered losses and closed down one after another. By the spring of last year, the sale of silk fabrics had slightly improved, and the market situation had slightly turned around. However, the total production volume was only one-tenth of that during the prosperous period. Looking back at the past and comparing it to the present, there is a great difference. According to surveys, the total output last year was no more than 20,000 bolts, of which silk crepe accounted for about 6,000 bolts, and narrow cloth with a width of 1.5 feet accounted for about 14,000 bolts. The total business volume of silk was about 500,000 yuan, with a capital of only 50,000 yuan (including Lian Zhuang deposits). No more than ten silk shops and satin shops (mostly engaged in both silk and satin, all struggling to maintain), and the opening of the market this year is even more bleak. Only De Yu Xiang and He Mao Xin remain among the silk shops (both also engaged in satin). All the Chang Ji, Heng Shun, Yong Ji, etc., lack funds to maintain operations, and whether they will continue depends on the situation when new silk arrives on the market. As for the satin shops, Jin Feng Zhuang, which is larger in scale, suffered another loss last year, and failed to resume operations this spring. The other three shops such as Wu Sheng Xiang, Zhi Cheng, and Rui Long, are small in scale, and few machines have been started this spring, and managers all hold a negative attitude. The number of machine operators at home and in the town is less than 200. In areas such as Taishi Bridge in the southern countryside, villagers have looms and weaving is a secondary occupation. Most of the woven fabrics are narrow cloths with a width of 1.5 feet. Because machine operators lack funds to operate, they are all employed by satin shops. Satin shops supply silk to the machine operators and set the work, quality, and specifications. All are controlled by the satin shops. Machine operators receive raw materials (silk) from the satin shops, weave the fabrics, deliver the goods, and receive wages. The situation is similar to piecework. However, since the market opened this spring, silk prices have fallen, and operators have suffered losses. Especially because the satin goods market is falling, satin shops want to reduce costs, so they reduce wages for machine operators. Machine operators, for the sake of profit, then cut the wages of weavers and underlings, such as silk repairers, thread rockers, warp carriers, and joint connectors, resulting in mutual infighting, and everyone complains. Weavers need three days to weave a bolt of silk, but the wages they earn are only enough to feed and clothe them for three days. Therefore, they have changed careers or sought work elsewhere, or become peddlers, but most are unemployed. As for villagers weaving silk, although they work for themselves and eat what they earn, there is no profit to be made, and they may even lose money. Therefore, rural machines are not as prosperous as they used to be, and the output this spring is also very small. Traveling merchants are stagnant, sales are sluggish, and the market is not good. If no measures are taken to save the situation, then the silk weaving industry in Puyuan will likely perish in the long run.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Ye Changming Arrested and Sent to the County</h3>
<p>Ye Changming, the former executive secretary of the third executive committee of the Songjiang County Party Department, embezzled 3,000 yuan of public funds and fled. After the military and police authorities offered a reward for his arrest, he was not caught for years. The detective Xia Shengyu of the Songjiang Public Security Bureau learned that Ye Changming was hiding in Tinglin Town in southern Shanghai. He took a document and went there, arrested him on the spot, and sent him to the county for investigation.</p>
<h3>Expanding the Road Surface of the Songsi Road</h3>
<p>In the past, the county decided to build the Songwei Road and the Songsi Road. The Songwei Road has long been completed. Yin Shisheng, a local, raised funds to organize the Shangsong Motor Company and purchased cars to operate, which has made transportation quite convenient. However, the business has not reached the highest level. The roadbed of the Songsi Road, which is currently under construction, has been completed by requisitioning labor. The bridges and culverts have also been completed. The Shangsong Motor Company will also take over the operation of the road once it is open to traffic. According to the company's observation, the business of the Songsi Road will be more developed than the Songwei Road. Yin Shisheng, the general manager of the company, submitted a request to the county government to expedite the paving of the road surface of the Songsi Road so that it could be opened to traffic as soon as possible. However, the county government stated that the cost of paving the road surface was still over 10,000 yuan, and that the road construction land tax had not been fully collected, so there were no funds to allocate, and construction would have to wait. It was suggested that the company find a way to borrow funds so that construction could begin immediately. Yin consulted with the financial community to negotiate a loan, with the road construction land tax to be collected as collateral. It is said that progress has been made, so the opening of the road is not far off.</p>
<h3>Taicang: Foundation Stone Laid for Boxun Bridge</h3>
<p>Wang Boxun, a wealthy banker from Shanghai, left a will stating that he would donate funds to rebuild a large cement bridge on the old site of the Xizaoxian Bridge in the western suburbs that had collapsed, spanning the Liu River and connecting Kunshan and Taicang counties. His son Wang Zhi Ru and nephew Wei Ru, following his will, invited gentry from Kunshan and Taicang counties to form a bridge construction committee. The construction cost was estimated at 11,000 yuan, designed by engineer Lu Chengxiang, and built by Shen Shengji Construction Factory of Shanghai. The foundation stone laying ceremony was held at 2:00 PM on the 18th, and construction began on the 19th. The people of Kunshan and Taicang praised the project endlessly and jointly submitted a request to the authorities for commendation.</p>
<h3>Residents of Wangyu Township Robbed</h3>
<p>Ye A'guan, a resident of Wangyu Township outside the West Gate, had only a few acres of meager farmland, barely enough to make a living. The other night, seven bandits suddenly came, carrying hemp ropes and other items, broke down the front door, tied up all the family members with ropes, and forbade them from making any noise. They wantonly robbed the house and left howling after about an hour. After inspection, all the valuables were completely robbed.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Arsonist Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Qian Arong's house in Sunjiaqiao, Fengqiao Township, Suzhou, was set on fire by Li Fuquan last month. Two girls were unable to escape and were tragically burned to death. The Wuxian County Court arrested Li Fuquan for interrogation. After the facts were verified, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Famous Actress Lan Yuechun Arrested and Sent to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Mengting, a lieutenant and quartermaster of the tax police regiment stationed in Nanchang, misappropriated 850 yuan of military pay and took a Yangtze River steamer eastward to hide in the No. 1 Inn in Wuxi County. The regiment found out and sent a formal letter to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, requesting them to send detectives to Wuxi to arrest Wang. Detectives from the Wuxi Public Security Bureau arrested Wang and took him to Shanghai for interrogation. After Wang was sent to Shanghai, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau found a number of pieces of evidence, including postal money orders and papers, indicating that he had sent 150 yuan to Lan Yuechun, a famous actress from the Xinguang Stage in Wuxi County. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau suspected Lan and sent Wu Xiufeng, the leader of the detective team, to Wuxi to arrest Lan at her residence in the No. 1 Inn with the detectives from the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, including Wang Bingsheng. Zhang, a clerk, opened court to interrogate Lan. Lan claimed to be from Beiping and worked as an actress. Wang had known her father, Lan Qingtang, for many years and had borrowed 100 yuan from her father several years ago, which had not been repaid with interest. A month ago, Wang sent her 150 yuan, with 50 yuan as interest. She knew nothing about Wang's embezzlement of public funds in Nanchang. Clerk Zhang ordered her to produce a receipt. She was sent to Shanghai on the morning of the 20th for interrogation. It is also said that Wang is the nephew of Wang Zikang, a famous accountant in Suzhou, and has wealthy assets. Lan's acquaintance with Wang was when Wang held a birthday celebration at his residence the year before last, and Lan performed at the celebration. Mengting admired Lan's martial arts skills, and they often visited each other after that. Lan did not know that Wang had committed a crime when he came to Wuxi this time.</p>
<h3>Unfilial Daughter Assaults Mother, Leading to Death</h3>
<p>Chen Yang, a 65-year-old widow residing at No. 86, Heye Village, Sibao Bridge, outside the North Gate of Wuxi County, had only one daughter, He Di, who was currently 30 years old. Ten years prior, Yang Zhao, her groom, Xu Abaobao, the 裏zhishou, as her son-in-law, the trio immediately reside in Heye Village. Di had even bore a daughter Ah Yu, who was now seven years old. However, Di was exceedingly overbearing. Bao did not strive for advancement, so livelihood was becoming increasingly difficult, gradually selling off family property to exhaustion, Di and moreover an opium addict habit, Di viewed Yang as a pest in her eyes, as soon as she did not conform, she beat and humiliated her, and even used the chamber pot on top of Yang's head. Yang, humiliated, felt the thought to end her life, and had drowned herself in the river on the 12th of this month but was rescued. Around 8PM the evening before last, Bao and Di viciously attacked Yang, the same night Yang hung herself on the bed, and was discovered only the next day. Her breath and body had been cut short. She was immediately roughly placed in a coffin and the authorities were not reported to. Now, Xu Bao is in fear of his crime and is at large, and Di is currently under surveillance.</p>
<h3>Municipal Management Committee Officially Abolished</h3>
<p>The establishment of the Wuxi Municipal Asset Management Committee was after the abolition of the Municipal Preparatory Office in 1930. Local people, in order to maintain the independence of municipal assets and not mix them with county funds, presented a request to the provincial government for organization, which has been done for five years. At the provincial government meeting on the 12th of this month, it was decided that Wuxi was a county system, not a municipal area, and the original Municipal Management Committee regulations were in conflict with the current county fund revenue and expenditure storage methods and the amended organization regulations of the public fund and public property management offices in various counties, which was officially decided to be abolished. The local people are deeply concerned that the county and municipal funds will be mixed and unclear from now on, the spirit of autonomy.</p>
<p>They conducted consultations on the matter, but as the provincial order had not yet been received, there was no concrete method. Yesterday, the county government received the provincial government's official order to abolish the Municipal Management Committee and limited the time to within a week for the county to take over the various funds and remaining donations of the committee for reporting. As for how much the various donations collected by the committee were actually collected, what items were used for, and why they were not included in the budget, it should be investigated in detail and reported truthfully for verification. County Chief Yan, upon receiving the order, determined that the affairs of taking over the Municipal Committee and the subsequent management methods were complex and could not be discussed with the local people in the long term, and he discussed them with the chief of the secretariat of the county government. It was decided to invite the director of the County Fund and Property Office, the original members of the Municipal Management Committee, and the accounting director to jointly discuss the method at 12 noon. The original municipal funds and municipal assets of the committee, as well as the various donations collected, will be managed by the County Fund and Property Office, and the original various donations collected will continue to be collected by the County Accounting Director. The Parks Management Committee, which originally belonged to the Municipal Management Committee, will also be reorganized with new appointments. However, the town chiefs of the first district stated that if the municipal funds and municipal assets and the collected donations were taken over by the county, the district administration would be broken and divided, greatly hindering the cause of autonomy. They specifically discussed with District Chief Qian Yuliang and held a district affairs meeting yesterday to jointly telegraph the provincial and county governments to have the original municipal funds and municipal assets and the collected donations under district administration, which would comply with the law and maintain the unity of district administration.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Unified Method for the Local Defense Corps Tax</h3>
<p>The local defense corps tax in this county has always been self-collected and self-used, which the financial department considers to be quite inconsistent, and malpractices have arisen. This tax is also one of the miscellaneous taxes, and the whole county has been following the unified system since July. Yesterday (the 18th), accounting specialist Tong Zhizhen was also sent by Changshu to Jiangyin to meet with County Chief Bao to discuss improving the collection system of the local defense corps tax so that the local defense cause would not be invisibly suspended, and to study the method of centralized unified collection, taking into account the people's ability to bear the burden, which will be decided after returning to report and being approved. On the 19th, the department commission also consulted the local area to be used as reference.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Bridge Construction Causes Trouble, Punished</h3>
<p>The Construction Department set a deadline for the completion of the Xihu Highway, and the bridge was contracted to Shanghai Yuqing Construction Company for construction. The construction is now underway section by section. There are many places in this county that the road passes through, and many bridges are also being built. The company has sent over a thousand people to work, but most of the workers are from northern provinces, and relying on their numbers, they often tease women and forcibly occupy houses, which has happened frequently here and cannot be prevented. On the 18th, the workers of the company who were building a bridge in the village saw a woman with the surname So and the farmers were working in the field, so they went forward to tease her. Her husband saw that there were many people, and he dared not reason with them, and just ordered his wife to return home. The workers were angry at him and punched and kicked him severely, causing serious injury. The farmers in the field all felt indignant and arrested Hua Anbo, the leading worker, and reported him to the local construction office, but they ignored it. So they were transferred to the Public Security Bureau and detained for example.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Raising Funds to Build the Wuli Road</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County government was ordered to rush to build the Zhendong Road in the Wujin section and the Wuli Road, with urgent speed. The Zhendong Road in the Wujin section has been completed separately before June 15 under the supervision of the town chiefs of each district along the road. The Wuli Road should be continued immediately, but County Chief Cai stated that the road construction funds had already been exhausted. Yesterday (19th), he specially sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the 25,000 yuan of the number of road construction land tax collected in the 24th year be used as a loan and requested to contact the financial community for a reply. The County Chamber of Commerce is currently contacting various banks and money shops to negotiate a loan. Once the funds are delivered to the county, the project can be carried out at any time.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Deadline for Completion of the Zhendan Highway</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang to Liyang Highway, passing through Danyang, Jintan, and being an important road of the provincial highway connecting Anhui Guangde, is about 120 miles long (Zhenjiang to Danyang 60 miles, Danyang to Jintan 70 miles, Jintan to Liyang 90 miles). It is operated by the Zhendan Jinli Motor Company. The Danjin section was officially opened to traffic last spring and also handled joint transportation with the Jinghu Railway, and the business was very good. For the Zhenjiang to Danyang section, the road surface in the Danyang area has been completed, and the Zhenjiang area has just started the foundation. The Jiangsu Construction Department urged this road to be connected to the provincial capital. It signed a contract with the company for the company to borrow funds to rush to build the road surface, a total of 14.5 kilometers. It has been contracted by the Hu Ji for construction, starting construction on the 25th of this month and setting a deadline for completion on September 10, passing over the railway at the South Gate Railway Station and entering the New South Gate, connecting with the Zhengqu, Zhencheng, and Zhenyang highways. As for the Jinli section, it is planned that the company will borrow funds from the bank to open to traffic within the year. At present, Jintan is connected to Lishui in the west, connecting with the Jinghang and Jingjian highways, and to Wujin in the east, connecting with the Jinghu Highway, forming a large circle and three small circles, and it is necessary to wait for the opening of the Zhendan to connect. Therefore, the Zhendan section of the highway is considered very important.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Special Commissioner's Office Interrogates Drug Case Criminals</h3>
<p>The Nantong District Administrative Inspector's Office, upon provincial order, after the district's subordinate counties in regards to drug manufacturing and trafficking, All were tried at the Commissioner's Office. Deputy Colonel Military Justice Qian Yi Su was additionally commissioned by the provincial government to handle matters regarding drug cases. The amount of funds was withdrawn from the anti-smoking funds.</p>
<h3>Holding Emergency Bank Protection Work for the Jiangnan Bank</h3>
<p>The riverbank collapse around Yao Dong Wolf Mountain in Tongyi became more and more serious. Disaster victims petitioned the county government. County Head Jin ordered the Construction Bureau to implement emergency bank protection projects as soon as possible, starting construction on a fixed date.</p>

<h3>New Import Tariff to be Announced</h3>
<p>The new export tariff has already been announced and implemented. As for the new import tariff, it will also be announced by the Ministry of Finance on July 1. Import tax rates for sugar and raw silk will also be increased or decreased accordingly. To avoid problems with the declaration date after the announcement of the new tariff, which could lead to disputes over different tax rates, the Jianghai Customs issued a special notice yesterday stating that for goods shipped in from overseas or requested to be taken out of storage for import, the tax collection method based on the prevailing tariff at the time of declaration will only apply to goods for which taxes are paid within 15 days from the date of declaration. If the taxes are not paid within the deadline and the tax rate is increased, the new tax rate will be applied.</p>
<h3>Sir Walter, Discusses the Future of China: Adopting Scientific Methods and Respecting Chinese Heritage Will Lead to Ultimate Success</h3>
<p>According to the "China Mail," there are widespread rumors that Sir Walter, a British scholar and former advisor to the Chinese government, has come to China with his wife on a formal mission. However, Sir Walter stated yesterday that this claim is unfounded. Sir Walter's trip is actually to renew old friendships with people from all walks of life in China and to investigate China's current progress. Sir Walter and his wife are currently staying at the Astor House Hotel and will only be staying in Shanghai for a few weeks before planning to travel to Beijing by waterway and then make a northern tour. Afterwards, they will go to Japan and return to their country by ship in October. Sir Walter does not want to make a definite comment on China at this time. According to his statement yesterday, it is impossible to tell the truth about the Far East based on what is published in newspapers. Therefore, he is making a private trip to find things that interest him. China, as a country, and in terms of its overall situation, has undergone major changes in international relations. He has only been in Shanghai for three days, so it is not convenient to discuss these events. However, he feels that China's economic situation seems to be worse than before, while its tranquility is better than in the past. China is now slowly evolving, and it is difficult to get the truth from afar in England. Therefore, he has come here for on-the-spot investigation. Sir Walter then commented on this inevitable trend of evolution, saying that China should train its people in this stage. Today's China is clearing everything. Students in the early 20th century realized in their mature years that swallowing Western culture wholesale would not achieve anything. As a result, serious students who understand their own situation are studying the national heritage with new eyes, that is, the original Chinese classics and cultural relics. They are now applying the true skills of Western scholarship, that is, scientific inquiry methods, to the original national heritage, in order to determine whether the reform of Chinese society can be based on a truly Chinese foundation. Sir Walter then clarified the important differences between today's Chinese political movement and the past, and mentioned the situation 25 years ago, saying that in recent years, in order to eradicate the feudal system of the Qing Dynasty, all old habits have been swept away. China was confused by the strength of Western countries and wanted to imitate the West in everything. Unfortunately, they neglected the important point of our historical development, that is, the position of Europe and the United States was naturally obtained in the modern world, not through political systems or military force, but through the special nature of each country. Today, the Chinese people gradually understand reality. Therefore, although the world has generally shed illusions about the political results of nationalism, the overall situation in China is now fundamentally hopeful. Sir Walter also talked about the pessimism held by some people in various aspects, saying that those with short-sightedness cannot but be pessimistic. However, if the Chinese themselves have foresight, there is hope in the development of the overall situation. This hope, in terms of politics and economy, lies in the fact that China is gradually breaking away from clamorous propaganda and emotional impulses, and enlightened people are striving to be pragmatic. However, because the number of such people is limited and they are at the core of the Chinese stage, they often feel frustrated in dealing with all problems. Sir Walter continued, (In my personal experience, the majority of Chinese students studying abroad are indeed completely separated from their countrymen and the historical, traditional, and cultural background of their country. Therefore, at one time, there was a conflict between those who wanted to let things take their natural course and those who advocated completely adopting Western methods to solve problems. Fortunately, most of those in leadership positions today are students who have studied abroad. They can use scientific methods to solve the fundamental implementation of current problems, while still respecting China's valuable heritage. Therefore, although China today has various forces and trends from abroad, it will eventually be able to achieve ultimate success and become a country without losing its purely Chinese state of society inherited from the past by adapting to the times and not forcing things to fit.)</p>
<h3>American Silver Expert, Rogers, Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Silver expert Dr. Rogers came to China two months ago and arrived in Shanghai. He went to Guangdong, Hubei, and other places to investigate, and also went to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Then, on the 2nd of this month, he went to Japan by sea. He returned to Shanghai on the Empress of Canada from Japan the night before last. A reporter from the Far East News Agency specially interviewed him at his office in the American Consulate on Jiangxi Road yesterday. According to him, during his stay in Japan, he met with the Minister of Finance and leaders of the banking industry to inquire about the situation of the silver market in that country, as his work scope was not limited to China. He is now back in Shanghai and is busy reviewing his past work. He is very willing to go to North China, Tianjin, and other places, but the date of departure has not been determined. As for when he will leave China to return to the United States, it is still too early to say, as it depends on the work situation.</p>
<h3>Chen Xiangtao Talks About the Opening of the Ping-Shen Railway</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the central government has decided on the issue of opening the Ping-Shen Railway. It will be jointly managed by Chinese and Japanese commercial organizations to form an international travel agency. The Japanese side has designated the Tourism Bureau, and the Chinese government intends to appoint the China Travel Service. However, the China Travel Service believes that this matter is of great importance, and the president personally cannot be responsible for making promises and must convene a board meeting to resolve it. A reporter from the Guomin News Agency went to the China Travel Service yesterday to interview Mr. Chen Xiangtao, the manager of the company. His remarks are as follows:</p>
<h3>Board Meeting Not Yet Held</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen first said that the news of the opening of the Ping-Shen Railway has been seen in various newspapers. All the detailed measures must still be announced by the government on the 28th. The central government has indeed entrusted our company to handle this matter, but this matter is of great importance, and it is by no means possible for the manager alone to take full responsibility. Therefore, a board meeting has been called, but the directors have not yet been held due to illness or being stranded in various ports.</p>
<p>However, we must find a way to convene it in the near future, as the government must officially announce the measures on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Chen's Trip to Tianjin is Pure Conjecture</h3>
<p>The report days ago that I went to Tianjin to discuss measures with Mr. Suzuki, the manager of the Japanese Tourism Bureau, is pure conjecture, as I have never left Shanghai since then.</p>
<h3>The New Shuntian Steamer Can Arrive This Morning: Sun Danlin's Abduction Confirmed</h3>

<h3>Ross is Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from the "China Mail," the parents of Ross, a crew member injured on the Shuntian ship, live at 120 Bekaier Road in Shanghai. Initial news from Yantai said that Ross's injuries were still good, but another telegram came at noon yesterday, saying that according to the doctor, his injuries may be fatal. Ross only started working for the Taikoo Company in November last year. His father used to work for the China Merchants Bureau and is now the captain of a lumber company, currently in Hankou. Ross's mother, upon hearing the news that her son was seriously injured, took the Shengjing ship from Shanghai to Yantai at noon yesterday. Northern Shipping Company ships have never had guards, but this time the Shengjing ship carried some British soldiers as guards. Before casting anchor, customs officers boarded the ship and conducted a strict inspection. Two lieutenants of the British Navy, Ruth and Field, who were hijacked on the Shuntian ship, recently took the Shengjing ship to Tianjin. While on board, they talked to the crew about the pirate hijacking and expressed various opinions. Unexpectedly, they were also captured by pirates this time.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Strives for Partnership Responsibility: Requests Prompt Enactment of Commercial Registration Law: Opinions of Merchants Should be Solicited as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Legislative Yuan yesterday, stating that at the 5th Member Congress held by the chamber on June 17, the Executive Committee proposed to continue striving for the joint and several liability case for partnership debts. The petition stated that the chamber had repeatedly submitted legal and commercial information to the Legislative Yuan and submitted a memorandum. It was proposed by Legislator Wu Kaixian to add a clause below Article 681 of the Civil Code: "However, if the partnership has formally registered with the competent authority, each partner may be liable for responsibility according to the amount of shares recognized by them," in order to reconcile the legislative purpose. However, the result of the joint meeting of the three committees of the Legislative Yuan on September 29 of that year was that the clause was deemed unnecessary to be revised, and that the partnership organization could be remedied by another commercial registration law. Subsequently, at the 33rd meeting of the Legislative Yuan, it was resolved that (1) the report should be reviewed and this article should not be revised; (2) the Commercial Law Committee and the Civil Law Committee should draft regulations on commercial registration law. Since then, it has been shelved until now, and the so-called commercial registration law has not been promulgated. It can be said that the point of contention in this case has not yet been resolved. Should the Legislative Yuan be requested to promptly formulate a commercial registration law for remedy? Before the law is promulgated, the opinions of merchant groups should be solicited as much as possible to avoid isolation. Is it appropriate to request a public resolution? It was submitted to the Congress for discussion, and it was considered that another commercial registration law would provide room for adjustment and remedy for the joint and several liability. Since it has been adopted by the Legislative Yuan, the registration law should be discussed and implemented as soon as possible so that it can be complied with. It was resolved that the Legislative Yuan should be requested to promptly discuss and decide on it. Before the law is drafted and before a resolution is made, the opinions of merchant groups should be solicited as much as possible to avoid isolation. The case has been recorded and submitted to your Yuan for review and approval for implementation. Respectfully submitted to the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Petitions to Ban the WanGuo Savings Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that at the 5th Member Congress held by the chamber on June 17, Zhang Yichen, the representative of the Candy, Biscuit, and Canned Food Industry Association, proposed to petition for the banning of the Wanguo Savings Society. With the inducement of prize-winning, it absorbs Chinese people's property, amounting to 60 to 70 million yuan. It is a great tool of economic aggression. Most of the property absorbed is accumulated by the hard work of employees in various industries. At this time when the financial conference decided to ban it, the Ministry of Finance should be petitioned to promptly implement the ban to protect the national economy. The methods are listed below. Is it appropriate to request a public resolution? (1) The depositors should closely monitor its assets and announce the itemized accounts. (2) The depositors whose terms have not expired should be instructed to transfer their deposits to Chinese banks. (3) If new accounts are opened with the Wanguo Savings Society, moral sanctions should be imposed. It was submitted to the Congress for discussion, and it was considered that Ma Yinchu, a member of the National Finance Conference, had spoken in detail about the drawbacks of this prize-winning savings. Domestic banks have imitated it, and the Ministry of Finance has issued an order to stop accepting new members. The state has recognized that the savings is detrimental to the national economy and restricts its continued promotion. Although the Wanguo Savings Society is managed by foreigners, it must be known that the definition of extraterritoriality can only be interpreted as that French depositors are not subject to the laws of the host country. If all the depositors are Chinese people, then whether this savings can continue to develop should be based on the laws of our country as the standard. The laws of that foreigner's country cannot be extended to our country's depositors. This is the proper boundary of extraterritoriality. Therefore, even if prize-winning savings are permitted by the laws of that country, its business operations in China can only attract depositors who are not of Chinese nationality. Furthermore, what business operations are allowed for foreigners in China and what should be prohibited? The treaty does not list any clear provisions, but matters related to national major masters and lawyers are subject to special laws and regulations of our country, and cannot enjoy the same rights as Chinese people. Foreigners are also at ease with this. Moreover, the business of prize-winning savings is restricted for Chinese people. How can foreign merchants be an exception? It was resolved that the Ministry of Finance should be petitioned to promptly implement the ban. The case has been recorded and submitted to your Ministry for review and approval for implementation. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Wu Yun-chu Established a Rare Gas Factory: Preparations Completed: Trial Run in August and Products by the End of the Year: Great Assistance to National Defense Upon Completion</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, Mr. Wu Yun-chu, a prominent industrial and commercial figure in Shanghai and manager of Tianchu MSG Factory, believes that most small industries focus on light profits, while basic industries do the opposite. He is determined to engage in the manufacturing of chemical industrial raw materials, which the world considers difficult and unwilling to do, to contribute to the country and society. His spirit and perseverance are commendable. For example, the Tianchu MSG Factory and Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory that he has already established, their products have long been popular and need no further explanation. He has also established the Tianli Rare Gas Factory, with a capital of one million yuan. The main machinery is ordered from the United States and France. It is learned that the synthetic argon manufacturing machinery ordered from the United States has now arrived in Shanghai in full. The remaining machinery ordered from France are all trivial components and will also arrive soon. The factory site has been surveyed and determined to be on the north bank of the Suzhou River, at the Jiangjiazhai, obliquely left of the Tianyuan Factory.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Petitions for the Abolition of the International Savings Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, stating that the chamber held its fifth member congress on June 17th. According to a proposal by Zhang Yichen, a representative of the Confectionery, Biscuit, and Canned Goods Guild, a petition was submitted to abolish the International Savings Society to protect the national economy. The petition stated that the International Savings Society uses prize draws as bait to absorb the assets of Chinese people, amounting to six or seven tens of millions of yuan, which is a major tool for economic aggression. The assets absorbed are mostly the result of the blood and sweat of employees in various industries. Now that the financial conference has resolved to abolish it, the Ministry of Finance should promptly execute the abolition to protect the national economy. The following measures are proposed for public decision: (1) Depositors should closely monitor its assets and publish all accounts; (2) Depositors whose terms have not expired should be instructed to transfer their deposits to Chinese-owned banks; (3) Those who open new accounts with the International Savings Society should be subject to reputational sanctions. This was submitted to the congress for discussion. Ma Yinchu, a member of the committee, had already elaborated on the harm of prize savings at the National Financial Conference. Domestic banks that imitated it were ordered by the Ministry of Finance last year to stop accepting new members. Therefore, this type of savings has been recognized by the state as detrimental to the national economy, restricting its continued promotion. Although the International Savings Society is managed by foreigners, it must be understood that the definition of extraterritoriality can only be interpreted as French depositors not being subject to the laws of the country where they are located. If all depositors are Chinese citizens, then whether this type of savings can continue to develop depends on whether our national laws are the standard for handling it. The laws of the foreigner's country cannot be arbitrarily applied to our country's depositors. This is the boundary of extraterritoriality. Therefore, even if prize savings are allowed by the laws of that country, its business scope in China can only be limited to attracting depositors who are not of Chinese nationality. Furthermore, the treaties do not explicitly list which businesses foreigners can engage in in China and which should be prohibited. However, in matters involving the major rights of the people, such as salt monopoly operators and accountants and lawyers, foreigners in China are subject to the restrictions of our special laws and cannot enjoy the same rights as Chinese people. Foreigners accept this as a matter of course. Moreover, the business of prize savings is restricted for Chinese people. How can foreign merchants be an exception? It was resolved to petition the Ministry of Finance to promptly implement the abolition. The case is hereby recorded and submitted to your ministry for review and approval. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Wu Yun Chu Establishes a Nitrogen Plant and Preparations Are Complete</h3>
<p>Trials Possible in August, Production by Year-End</p>
<p>Great Assistance to National Defense Upon Completion</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Wu Yun Chu, a prominent industrial and commercial figure in this city and manager of the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, believes that most small industries focus on light investment and heavy profits, while capital-intensive industries are the opposite. He is determined to engage in the manufacturing of raw materials for the chemical industry, which is considered difficult and undesirable by many, to contribute to the country and society. His spirit and perseverance are commendable. The products of the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory and Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, which he has already established, have long been popular. Moreover, he has established the Tianli Nitrogen Plant with a capital of one million yuan. The main machinery was custom-made from the United States and France. It is reported that the synthetic argon manufacturing machinery ordered from the United States has all arrived in Shanghai. The machinery ordered from France consists of small components and will arrive soon. The factory site has been surveyed and is located on the north bank of the Suzhou River, diagonally left of the Jiangjiazhai Tianyuan Factory.</p>
<h3>Shenxin Factory Denies Newspaper Rumors</h3>
<p>Shenxin Factory Has No Dealings With Jin Cheng Bank</p>
<p>Cotton Control Association Sending Staff to Guide Machine Improvements</p>
<p>According to a report in the Japanese Daily News, Rong Zongjing, a prominent figure in the cotton industry, founded the Shenxin Yarn Factory, which will be managed by the Cotton Control Association and the banking community due to the impact of large loans. Rong Puren, the assistant manager of the Shenxin Yarn Factory, visited reporters from the Guowen News Agency, the World News Agency, and the Dagong News Agency yesterday, saying that the Shenxin Yarn Factory is one of the largest enterprises in the country. Due to business competition, foreigners have spread rumors to undermine it. The previous report in the Japanese newspaper that Rong had fled to Hong Kong was one example. Today's report that the factory owes the Chinese Jin Cheng Bank more than ten million yuan can be verified with the Jin Cheng Bank. The factory has never had any dealings with Jin Cheng. As for the Cotton Control Association sending staff to the factory, two engineers have been hired to improve the spinning machinery and correct management. This is not unique to this factory. The Yong'an Yarn Factory and others have also hired excellent talent as consultants to seek improvements. Rong is a member of the Cotton Control Association. How can the factory be managed and controlled by the Cotton Control Association? However, some people do not hesitate to spread rumors to discredit the factory.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The factory covers more than fifty mu. The factory buildings are constructed of steel and reinforced concrete. The designs have already been completed. A portion is under construction, and the rest has been started. The total construction cost is estimated at one hundred thousand yuan. The total value of the machinery is about seven hundred thousand yuan. Other equipment will cost about one hundred to two hundred thousand yuan. Trial runs are expected in August, and production can begin by the end of the year. According to Mr. Gao Er of the Tianchu Factory, the establishment of the factory will not only greatly assist in the supply of industrial raw materials but also help in the manufacture of ammunition necessary for national defense. The main product of this factory is nitric acid, estimated to produce eleven tons per day. It can be used to make fertilizer for farmers in peacetime and can be converted into explosives and all kinds of chemical raw materials needed for military purposes in wartime.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhixiang Regains Freedom, Welcome Meetings Held in Two Places Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Zhixiang, Director of the Shanghai Sulfur Bureau, was previously accused of being a communist. He was once summoned by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. After investigation, the accusation was found to be untrue, and he was released. Upon hearing the news, the Shangyu Fellow-Villagers Association and others believed that Wang had been wrongly accused. Therefore, welcome meetings were held yesterday morning at the Zhabei Grand Theater on Menggu Road in Zhabei and at the Shangyu Fellow-Villagers Association. Wang reported on his experiences in prison. He was quite tactful and self-reproachful, without any complaints. The meetings adjourned at noon.</p>
<h3>Families of Li Du's Troops to be Sent to Xinjiang</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the troops of General Li Du are currently stationed in Xinjiang, guarding the border. The families of the soldiers are mostly living in Shanghai and Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin). Li had repeatedly requested the central government to send them to Xinjiang. The central government has approved this. Li recently went to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the arrangements for sending them to Xinjiang and request early allocation of funds. It is reported that Li will return to Shanghai within a few days to investigate the roster of the families of the soldiers and prepare to send them to Xinjiang.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Expelled From Japan, Chen Chongxi and Others Went to Nanjing Yesterday, Will Ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a Strong Protest</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Chen Chongxi and fifteen other overseas Chinese in Japan are all members of the Kuomintang. They have been doing business in Japan for many years. Recently, they were resented by the Japanese authorities for participating in patriotic movements. They were ordered to cease business operations under the pretext of business license issues and detained for two nights. They were escorted onto the Japanese cargo ship Tsukuba Maru to return to China. They arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. All their property was confiscated. Because the overseas Chinese were unfamiliar with the local conditions in Shanghai, they went to the Municipal Party Department to petition for relief. The department specially sent Yu Yaoqiu, a staff member of the Investigation Section, and Tan Jing of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to contact the Red Cross Society for ship tickets. They accompanied the overseas Chinese on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangda ship to Nanjing at 4:00 PM to report to the central government the details of their forced return and demand that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodge a strong protest with the Japanese authorities to protect the safety of the overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Sends Another Letter to the Public Works Department to Handle the Telephone Suspension Case According to Law, Wang Xian Gu Claims Illegal Suspension Is Verified, the Revenue Office Collected by Telephone Company Should Be Abolished</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department, stating, "We are writing to you that, according to a letter from taxpayer Wang Xian Gu, we received a letter from the Public Works Department stating that the facts stated by the taxpayer were untrue. We are very surprised. According to the receipts from the landlord, Taichang Company, the taxpayer rented Room 205, No. 430 Zhejiang Road, starting from March 21st. On the afternoon of April 17th, a tax collector, Parisi, accompanied by Wilson, came to the office and created a disturbance. Many people in the office building came to watch and can testify. Later, the Revenue Office ordered the telephone company to disconnect the line on the 5th of last month. The telephone company stated in a letter that it was instructed by the Revenue Office. The facts are clear and the evidence is conclusive. How can it be denied by empty words? The tax collector of the Revenue Office was arrogant and unreasonable when he was on Jiangxi Road. The taxpayer did not argue with him. However, if there was a dispute, the Revenue Office would resolve it legally, and the taxpayer would comply with the law. This time, the taxpayer objected to the excessive collection of housing tax. The Public Works Department has a regular lawyer and should file a lawsuit for adjudication according to law. However, it did not do so and ordered the telephone company to disconnect the line illegally. The Public Works Department is an organization that represents the citizens of the concession. Disputes with taxpayers over taxes are only civil matters and have absolutely nothing to do with the telephone company. Even if it is absolutely necessary, the Public Works Department has the police force to rely on and cannot ask for help from the operating company under its supervision. If the telephone company can collect taxes, wouldn't the Revenue Office of the Public Works Department be redundant, and the position of the director of the Revenue Office should be abolished? Moreover, the telephone company is a private public utility organization, similar to other electricity and water companies. When things happen that harm the public interest, the Public Works Department has already asked for help from the former. How can it exercise its supervisory powers in the future? Citizens pay taxes to the Public Works Department in the hope that it will represent their rights. It is important to know that the Public Works Department is a normal municipal organization. Its exercise of political power has a certain scope and is not an autocratic tyrant with unlimited authority. No matter what agreement the Public Works Department and the telephone company have, and the contract signed by the user, if it is not voluntary, stopping the taxpayer from using the telephone is depriving the people of their freedom of communication guaranteed by the constitution and is fundamentally illegal. The taxpayer believes that stopping the individual from using the telephone is a small matter, but it is a big matter of illegality, overstepping authority, and harming the interests of the citizens. Therefore, we are writing again to request your association to promptly forward this letter to the Public Works Department to restore the telephone service immediately and compensate for all the losses caused by the disconnection in order to protect the legal rights." Respectfully submitted to the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>Two Silk Factories in Zhabei Start Work, Five Dan of Cocoons to Produce One Dan of Silk, Losses Incurred Even After Wages Paid</h3>
<p>There were originally 207 silk factories in this city. Large factories can accommodate seven or eight hundred machines, and small ones can accommodate hundreds or dozens of machines. Each machine requires three male and female workers, totaling 207 factories, requiring 200,000 workers. Last year, due to the impact of high cocoon prices and low silk prices, large and small silk factories closed down, causing men and women workers to suffer unemployment, which is also a major problem in society. Recently, it was learned that the Yutong Silk Factory at the intersection of Meiyuan Road and Hanzhong Road has started work, with 240 silk machines. When fully operational, it can accommodate more than 700 male and female workers. The Jiucheng Silk Factory, formerly known as Jiucheng Silk Factory, now renamed Yongli, on Changan Road, Changan Lane, has also started work, with more than 300 male and female workers. It is also heard that there are more than a dozen factories in the process of being renovated. Once the new cocoons arrive in Shanghai, they can also start work. According to people in the silk industry, although the factories are reluctantly starting work this year, it is difficult to make a profit because the current price of new cocoons from Huzhou is more than 90 yuan per dan (100 catties). Five dan of cocoons are used to produce one dan of silk. The current price of silk is only 460-470 yuan per dan. After deducting labor costs, there will still be a loss.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon Industry Association Cables Request for Reduced Improved Cocoon Tax</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon Industry Association Joint Association cabled the Zhejiang authorities, stating to the Hangzhou Zhejiang Provincial Government Finance Department Construction Department, "The Zhejiang Province Management Regulations for Cocoon Collection levy an improvement fee of 3 jiao per dan for local fresh cocoons and 6 jiao per dan for improved fresh cocoons. At this time of the tragic decline in silk cocoons, the levy is too high. We cabled on May 1 to request amendments and reductions. Now that the cocoon market has ended, cocoon merchants in various counties believe that the silk prices are falling and the cost of collecting cocoons is too high, and losses are worrying. They have filed protests and refused to pay. The reasons they hold are largely the same. The previous Jiang cable stated that the price of local fresh cocoons in previous years was more than 50-60 yuan per dan. Zhejiang Province collected an improvement fee of 3 jiao per dan of dried cocoons according to the Sima scale. In contrast to today, the cocoon price has fallen by no less than two-thirds, and the collection of the improvement fee has changed from dried cocoons to fresh cocoons, and from the Sima scale to the market scale. The improvement fee for improved varieties is as high as 6 jiao, which is more than four times the previous rate. Merchants can no longer bear the burden. The authorities are brewing today's phenomenon. Improvement is the fundamental plan to save silk cocoons, but the improvement funds are all taken from silk cocoon merchants who have failed for years, which seems to run counter to the government's intention to exempt all silk cocoon taxes. Moreover, local varieties have not received the benefits of improvement, but the cocoon cost has been increased, which is why merchants have protested. After repeated deliberation, the association believes that it is better to reduce the fee than to remain deadlocked. Merchants will be less burdened and will be happy to transport the cocoons. Therefore, we urgently request your government to promptly modify the Management Regulations for Cocoon Collection and the item of levying an improvement fee in order to relieve the difficulties of merchants and quell disputes. We await your urgent orders." The Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon Industry Association Joint Association.</p>
<h3>Chinese Cigarette Factory Association Sends Letter Inquiring About the Truth of the Cigarette Tax Change</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association recently learned from newspapers that the Legislative Yuan was considering changing the cigarette tax rate. The industry and managers were panicked and came to the association to inquire. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Taxation Administration to inquire about the truth. The original letter is recorded below: "We are writing to you that we recently read in the newspapers that the two committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting. The director of your administration personally attended and stated that there will be a tiered tax rate, in which the price of 50 cigarettes sold for 3-5 jiao will be specially reduced, and those above 2 yuan will be increased. The members of our association hope very much that the lower-level cigarette tax can be reduced if the tax law is changed. What exactly is the content? We hope to see it so as to comfort the public." Respectfully submitted to the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance, Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association, June 20th.</p>
<p>The Taxation Administration replied, "We are replying to your letter that we received a letter stating that the two committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting. The director of your administration personally attended and requested that the details of the agreed tax rate be informed. On the 18th of this month, the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan initially reviewed the revised Cigarette Unified Tax Regulations. The Ministry of Finance sent Councilor Yang, and the Cigarette Tax Section of our administration sent Section Chief Jiang to attend. The director of our administration did not personally attend. As for how the Cigarette Unified Tax Regulations should be revised in the future, it is still in the initial review meeting of the Legislative Yuan and should wait for the discussion of the Legislative Yuan. However, the Ministry believes that the central treasury is currently in deficit, and the original tax revenue should be maintained. Even if there are changes in the cigarette tax rate, the lower tax rate will not be reduced. We hope that your association will inform the industry to rest assured to do business and actively reorganize in business to seek proper development." Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Values Revitalizing the Fishing Industry, Director of the Fishery Protection Zone Returns to Shanghai After Official Duty, Fishing Season This Year Is Better Than in Previous Years</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Yuan Lianghua, Director of the Fishery Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry, recently went to Nanjing to meet with Minister Chen. However, Minister Chen had just returned from overseas and was very busy dealing with departmental affairs. Therefore, Yuan only gave a brief report on the official duties of the office. As for the office's budget for the next year, it has been prepared by the office and submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval. It has not yet been approved. However, given the current financial difficulties of the central government, it may be difficult to expand the office's business expenses.</p>
<p>Regarding the protection of the fishing season, the fishing season for the first half of this year is about to end, with only about half a month left. The office has sent four fishing vessels to protect it. To avoid disputes between fishing gangs, the fishing range of each gang has been divided. Therefore, the fish caught by fishermen in general during this year's fishing season has increased by about one-third compared with previous years. This is the first year that fishermen have had such peace since the fishing season began. All the fishing vessels of the office have been patrolling the sea from 4:00 AM to 8:00 PM every day during the peak of the fishing season. Now that the fishing season is coming to an end and the fishing vessels have been in use for a long time, it is planned to temporarily withdraw them for repair.</p>
<p>Regarding the revitalization of the fishing industry, it is rumored that the Ministry of Industry intends to establish a fishery police station in Haikou to expand the fishery protection business. It is understood that this matter may be difficult to realize for a while. As for the fishing port, the Ministry of Industry may have this plan, but this matter requires a large amount of funds and is difficult to realize in a short period of time. However, the Ministry of Industry attaches great importance to the revitalization of the fishing industry. Recently, it plans to open a fish market in Shanghai. After this plan is realized, it will seek the gradual realization of other businesses.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Establishes National Railway Refrigeration Business, Councilor Xia Arrives in Shanghai to Contact Banks</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Railways plans to establish a national railway refrigeration business and contacted the Shanghai banking community to invest in construction. It was recently reported that the Ministry of Railways has agreed with five banks in Shanghai and other places to borrow 1.5 million yuan and signed a contract. According to reporters' inquiries from the banking community, the loan has not been finalized.

<h3>County Land Survey Fee Custody Committee Abolished, Strictly Prohibit Villagers From Removing Markers</h3>
<p>The land survey fee for Shanghai County is collected from the land tax at a rate of 1 jiao per mu. After this fee is collected, it is specially managed by the Land Survey Fee Custody Committee to show caution. Now, the county government has received an order from the province that, starting from the 23rd year, the land survey fee will be collected and stored and directly submitted to the treasury by the county. The Land Survey Fee Custody Committee will be eliminated at the end of the 22nd year. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Pan instructed the committee to complete the work by the end of this month. Also, the county government learned from the land survey team of this county that, in the first and third districts, ignorant villagers arbitrarily removed the guide wire markers or placed them in the river, and they must be re-surveyed to have standards. This hinders the progress of the business. Therefore, in addition to instructing the township and town chiefs of each district to protect them at any time, County Magistrate Pan also hopes to inform the public that if they are removed again, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Taxation Administration Cables to Order All Provinces to End Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax, Ends From July 1, Handed Over to Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi proposed that all provinces abolish miscellaneous taxes decided at the financial conference and replace them with two types of taxes, stamp tax and tobacco and alcohol license tax, to be collected locally to compensate for this. This was also approved at the financial conference and sent to the Ministry of Finance for implementation. Now the Ministry of Finance has consulted with the Ministry of Transportation on the stamp tax sales procedures. Once the measures are determined, they will be announced and implemented. The Ministry of Finance will first cable the Taxation Administration to instruct all provinces to end the work on July 1. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegram of Instructions (Original Text)</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphs the Tax Affairs Department to relay to the Provincial Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureaus: Bureau Chiefs of Provincial Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureaus, take note: The tobacco and alcohol license tax has been decided by the Fiscal Conference to be collected by the local governments. The Ministry has already issued an order to implement this starting from July 1st of this year. Fearing that the written order will take time to arrive, this is to inform you by telegraph in advance. All tobacco and alcohol license tax sub-bureaus, or tobacco and alcohol sub-bureaus concurrently handling tobacco and alcohol license tax affairs, under the jurisdiction of the respective provincial bureaus, must be ordered to completely cease these activities by June 30th. Absolutely no autumn season license tax shall be collected, in order to clearly delineate the boundaries and avoid disputes. You are hereby instructed to telegraph this order for immediate compliance. Tax Affairs Department Director Wu Qiaoyin.</p>
<h3>Prospects for Increased Revenue</h3>
<p>According to records, during the waning years of the Qing Dynasty, between the Guangxu and Xuantong reigns, the national treasury was depleted and there was no way to replenish it. A Tobacco and Alcohol Donation Tax Bureau was specially established; this was the beginning of establishing a bureau to collect taxes. After the founding of the Republic, the tax items became numerous, and the tax rates were also inconsistent, causing even greater disturbance to the people. During the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the central government reformed the tax system, re-established unified tax regulations, and improved the collection methods, resulting in an improvement in tax revenue. From January of the 20th year (1931), the Provincial Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureaus were merged with the Stamp Tax Bureaus. In July of the same year, the Provisional Regulations for Tobacco and Alcohol Business Licenses and the Implementing Rules were promulgated, gradually unifying the authority and increasing tax revenue. The collection method is divided into three categories: tobacco, alcohol, and foreign liquor. All firms engaged in the above three types of businesses must pay fees and obtain licenses before they can operate. The tax is paid annually in four seasons, with different grades. However, the amount of this tax revenue each year is not large. Last year, the ten provinces that directly remitted to the central government (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Henan) totaled approximately 1.8 million yuan. In the future, after being transferred to local collection, with the assistance of local governments, it is estimated that there could be a several-fold increase in revenue.</p>

<h3>Jiang Yong Steamer Arrives in Chongqing Quickly</h3>
<p>The Jiang Yong steamer of the Xinghua Shipping Company in this port is a fast Chinese merchant ship sailing between Shanghai, Hankou, Yichang, and Chongqing.

The goods loaded from Shanghai this time were mainly cotton yarn and general merchandise.</p>
<h3>Xinhua Village Housing Project Starts Construction</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Penglai Market National Products Exhibition to Close at End of Month Yesterday's Reception for Women</h3>

The association, through its third meeting of manufacturer representatives, resolved to extend the exhibition by nine days, closing at the end of this month, to promote domestic products and provide the public with an opportunity to recognize high-quality domestic goods.

<h3>Rental Dispute in Ningkang Lane Tenant Urges Landlord to Collect Rent</h3>
<p>Regarding the houses in Ningkang Lane on North Zhejiang Road, during this period of rent reduction, the landlord Li Dafu, through his lawyer Wu Zhiping, had notified the tenants last November of a 15% rent increase, retroactive to December of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), requiring each household to pay an additional 179.40 to 715 yuan. The tenants in the lane argued that they had already paid their monthly rent in full and that there was no reason for extra charges. The two sides have been in disagreement for nearly half a year, and the landlord has not collected any rent. The tenants are deeply concerned that the accumulation of rent will be too large, leading to danger in the future. Therefore, yesterday, they specially sent a letter to the landlord, urging him to collect the rent as soon as possible. Dear Mr. Dafu, the matter of your recent notice of a rent increase and retroactive collection for more than three years is a major issue that is not easily resolved and difficult to comply with. We have repeatedly pleaded in person and submitted our situation in writing. At yesterday's court hearing, we were again encouraged to settle the matter peacefully, which is what everyone wants. We, the tenants, believe that rent increases and rent collection are two separate matters, but your esteemed landlord has stopped collecting rent due to the unresolved rent increase. Time waits for no one, and it has already been more than half a year. In public, there is legal protection, so there is no need to worry about missing a single penny. However, as days accumulate, we are concerned because there are many people, and it is difficult to ensure compliance. We fear that one or two people may not understand the situation and deliberately delay paying rent. Once we are asked to collect from them, there will be no way to raise the money, and the impact will inevitably lead to legal problems. Who caused this? To encourage others to commit crimes is no different from committing crimes yourself. Wise people should not do this. We, the tenants, have seen this and have no choice but to inform you. During this period of calls for rent reduction in Shanghai society, to talk about rent increases, regardless of whether the timing is appropriate, the tenants simply cannot afford it. This requires lengthy discussion. Therefore, regarding the payment of the original rent, we propose that you instruct the rent collectors to collect the rent as soon as possible. Otherwise, there may be danger in the future, which is not a win-win situation. Dedicated to your prosperity, the Ningkang Lane Tenant Association. June 18th.</p>

<h3>Chief Physician of the Two Railways Gu Puquan Transferred to Jinpu Railway</h3>
<p>Gu Puquan, chief physician of the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Hospital, from Wuxing, Zhejiang, is a medical graduate of Qilu University. He has served as a medical officer on the two railways for more than ten years. Whenever employees are sick, he always provides them with careful diagnosis and treatment as if they were his own family. Therefore, the employees of the two railways deeply love and respect Dr. Gu. Recently, Dr. Gu suddenly received an order from the Ministry to be transferred to the position of Chief of the Health Section of the Jinpu Railway Bureau. Upon hearing the news, colleagues from the two railways telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to request that he be retained. However, because the Ministry's expectations were very high, the request was not granted. It is now learned that Dr. Gu will be going to take up his new position within days. Therefore, colleagues from the two railways and friends of Dr. Gu have been hosting farewell banquets for days.</p>
<h3>Involved in the 12,000 Yuan Robbery Tang Qingyue Arrested Denies Robbery Zhang Zuming Sought Treatment for Syphilis Used as Evidence of Treating People</h3>
<p>Zhang Zuming, owner of Ruichangshun Hardware Store at 101 Broadway, Hongkou, a native of Ningbo; Zhuang Jimeng, small owner of Zhuangyuanda Trough Workshop at 42 Seward Road; and Jiang Lianyou, a hardware broker residing at 931 Xiangyu Lane, Donghan_ Li Road, allegedly conspired to use weapons at approximately 4:00 PM on the 9th of this month, broke into the accounting firm of Xue Mai Luo at 9 Edward Road, robbed Gao Yushu and other employees of the Yiyuan Racecourse of 12,000 yuan in cash, and fled. It was not until recently that the French Concession police arrested Zhang, Zhuang, Wang and three others, seized two pistols, and handed them over to the Second Special District Local Court for interrogation. It is now learned that there were four robbers at the time. In addition to the three already captured, there is still one fugitive. According to Zhang Zuming's confession to the French police, that person's name is Tang Qingyue, originally from Taicang. He currently operates Dade Hospital at 293 Gordon Road in the Public Concession, serving as the director of the hospital and concurrently as the principal of the Dade Midwifery School. Therefore, at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the French police secretly ordered detectives to rush to the Gordon Road Police Station and request assistance with the arrest. The police chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the hospital with the visiting detectives. At that time, Tang was still asleep. The detectives entered the inner room and apprehended Tang. He was then handed over to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation by Judge Wu Tingqi. The French police also escorted Zhang Zuming to the court for questioning. First, Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, described the situation of assisting the French police in arresting Tang Qingyue. Then, Zhang Zuming confessed in detail the situation of armed robbery with his accomplices at the Xue accounting firm on that day, as well as the distribution of the loot afterward. He said that there were four robbers including himself. Tang Qingyue was standing next to the ladder at the time. After grabbing the money, they fled to the Bund together and distributed the money in the car. Tang got 3,000 yuan, and he got 1,000 yuan. When questioned, Tang Qingyue completely denied it, claiming that he was in the hospital that day. From 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM, he was treating people, a total of seven people, all of whom had evidence. He testified that Zhang Zuming had suffered from syphilis in the past and came to the hospital for treatment, so they knew each other. He also hired lawyer Sun Zuji for defense. Finally, the representative of the French police requested that Tang be transferred and punished together. Judge Wu reviewed the confession and ordered Tang Qingyue to be handed over to lawyer Sun to be taken to the Second Special Court to await interrogation.</p>
<h3>Sheng Nanshan, a Guest at the Industrial and Commercial Inn, Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Sheng Nanshan, a native of Songjiang, 49 years old this year, worked at Quanfengqia Foreign Goods Store in Zhujiajiao Town, Qingpu. Recently, he came to Shanghai. At 11:00 AM on the 19th, he checked into Room 19 of the Industrial and Commercial Inn at 24 Xixinqiao Street, French Concession, alone. For unknown reasons, he suddenly had a moment of depression and took his own life. He went out at 9:00 PM to buy poison, raw opium, and returned to the inn at 10:00 PM. He secretly swallowed the poison and committed suicide. At 8:30 AM the next morning, he groaned in pain due to the poison taking effect. The waiter Li Shunlin discovered it and went into the room to check. Sheng was pale and unable to speak. He immediately reported it to the French police, who took him to Renji Hospital. Due to the deep spread of the opium poison in his abdomen, the treatment was ineffective. He died at 10:15 AM. The hospital notified the police, who sent detective Zhang Chunsheng to investigate. A letter was found next to the deceased's body. It was sent to the deceased by his son-in-law, Wei Wenxing (who works at Tongshoukang Store east of the Yue Temple outside the West Gate of Songjiang). The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for a post-mortem examination. A quick letter was sent to his son-in-law to come to Shanghai, and a request will be made to the Second Special Court today to send someone to inspect the body.</p>
<h3>Fire in Zhenxing Rubber Factory, Dongbaoxing Road, Zhabei Two Buildings Burned Firestarter Sent to Bureau for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Zhen Huaxing Rubber Factory at No. 16 Dongbaoxing Road, Zhabei, was opened by Liu Kunming from Rugao. At approximately 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out due to careless burning of rubber. The fire quickly became fierce and broke through the roof. When the nearby police learned of the fire, they immediately used the telephone to notify the Zhabei fire brigade to come to the scene. The fire was already raging and uncontrollable. The firefighters tried their best to put out the fire. At approximately 5:00 AM, the fire was extinguished. In addition to the complete destruction of the Zhen Huaxing Rubber Factory, it burned down four homes in Qingshun Lane 3, 4, 5, and 6, causing significant losses of goods. At that time, the order was very chaotic. The police from the First Precinct of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were dispatched to suppress the situation and investigate the cause of the fire. The fire starter who caused the disaster was taken to the station for detention and interrogation and sent to the Third Section of the General Bureau for handling in accordance with the law. It is said that the factory had insured 4,000 yuan of fire insurance with the China Insurance Company.</p>

<h3>Collapse of House in Beifurun Lane, Luxiangyuan Road Several People Injured Rescued from Rubble Sent to Hospital for Treatment</h3>
<p>There are eleven lanes of houses, all Shikumen, in Furun Lane and Derun Lane in Jiumu, Luxiangyuan Road, within the city. There are more than 400 buildings in total. The houses were built in the first year of the Republic (1912). The property is currently owned by a wealthy businessman Wang from Zhenjiang. Recently, the owner, considering that the houses in the two lanes were old and somewhat skewed, and that the walls of the houses in Furun Lane collapsed and injured pedestrians during a big wind last summer, decided to renovate all the houses in Furun and Derun Lanes. He notified the tenants to move out and repeatedly urged them to move, resulting in disputes. Until last month, after mediation, the deadline was set for the end of May for all tenants to move out of the houses so that construction could begin. However, the tenants along the road in Furun Lane had not moved out by the deadline, preventing construction from starting. After the owner urged them to move, they all moved out at the beginning of this month, and bamboo fences were built. Recently, workers were hired to demolish the old houses, and construction was underway. However, at 4:45 PM yesterday afternoon, at No. 1 Lane in Beifurun Lane, Luxiangyuan Road, the back door of the house was next to Liu's Tomb Lane. When the old house was being demolished, the rear row of houses facing Liu's Tomb Lane suddenly collapsed, from No. 3 in the lane to No. 12 to the west, injuring seventeen or eighteen people to varying degrees. The police station immediately reported the incident to the First Precinct of the Second District by telephone. The director, Tang, personally led more than twenty patrol officers and police officers to the scene to suppress the situation and telegraphed the fire brigades of the Second District, West District, and North District to send ambulances to the scene. The Red Cross Society of Nanshi also sent two ambulances to the scene. Together, they helped the injured into the ambulances and transported them to the Red Cross for treatment. The most seriously injured were Jiang Changji, from Pudong, a carpenter living in Xiaobeimen; Wu A'da, 58 years old, a laborer living in Liu's Tomb Lane; Zhu Si, 34 years old, a laborer living in Liu's Tomb Lane; Tian Xiaomao, 18 years old, living in Yan Hai Lane; and a Wang girl, 6 years old, who was being cared for by an old woman, playing with cigarette butts at the back door of No. 8 when the collapse occurred. The above six people were the most seriously injured, some with head injuries and some with internal injuries. The remaining minor injuries were treated and discharged on the spot, or hired cars to go to the hospital themselves. At the time of the house collapse, the houses along the street in Liu's Tomb Lane were mostly occupied by laborers. The cries for help were endless, and the order was greatly disrupted. The lane was narrow, causing the utensils and bricks in the houses to be damaged. Traffic in the lane was cut off. By 7:00 PM, the collapsed rubble had been cleared by workers, and traffic was restored. Currently, the police station has ordered police officers to guard the east and west lane entrances of Liu's Tomb Lane and ordered the house builders to demolish the old houses as soon as possible to avoid further danger.</p>
<h3>Zhang Guoxiang, Who Threw a Bomb at Xinghualou, Imprisoned Judge Ultimately Believes Motivated by Righteous Indignation Should Be Punished for Sabotaging and Resisting Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>Zhang Guoxiang, a member of the Red-Blooded Eradication Group, previously used a bomb to sabotage and resist enemy goods at the Guangdong restaurant Xinghualou on Fuzhou Road. Because the restaurant privately purchased Japanese seafood and acted as a traitorous merchant, he threw a bomb wrapped in yellow paper into the store on the evening of the 10th of last month when there were few people entering and exiting, as a warning. The police heard the alarm and pursued and captured Zhang. The next day, he was prosecuted by the First Special District Local Court for the crime of obstructing freedom under criminal law. At the conclusion of the interrogation, the court, considering that his actions were motivated by righteous indignation, sentenced him to three months in prison. However, the police believed that Zhang's actions could not be considered motivated by righteous indignation because he had not made good-faith admonitions beforehand and had used drastic measures to deal with the situation. Therefore, they were not satisfied with the initial judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting that the original judgment be overturned and a more appropriate judgment be made. The criminal judge, Tingzhang Yu, specially convened a collegiate panel, summoned witnesses, and reviewed Zhang Guoxiang's case in detail. Yesterday afternoon, the court announced its decision, dismissing the police's appeal. Zhang immediately stated that he was willing to serve the three-month sentence. The police lawyer also stated that he would not appeal further. The court then ordered that the original judgment be executed and Zhang was sent to the Tilanqiao Prison to serve his sentence.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Examination of Luo Zhaoxin Prosecutor Orders Extraction of Bullet for Examination Body Does Not Know Who Had Grudges</h3>
<p>Luo Zhaoxin's law office was located at No. 7 Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road. Around 8 PM the other night, Luo was suddenly attacked by thugs. After the Old Zhabei police received the report, they ordered detective Xie Guisheng to investigate and sent Luo to Renji Hospital. The details of his death were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It was learned that Luo's body was immediately transported to the Fei Lun Road autopsy station. Around 10 o'clock, Guo Wei, prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court, together with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the station to examine the body. First, the Western police chief 嘒文 reported that after the incident, Huabu No. 2320 saw it and reported it to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate. A bullet casing was found in the lane, two yards away from the deceased, and is currently held at the police station for inspection. The reason for his assassination is currently being investigated in detail, but a bullet has not yet been extracted. Luo Yusheng, the deceased's son, testified that he was 20 years old, lived at No. 459 North Henan Road, and was currently a student. He did not know who his father had a feud with. After hearing the testimony, Prosecutor Guo ordered that the deceased Luo Zhaoxin, male, had indeed died after being shot in the head. A bullet should be extracted by the forensic doctor and temporarily handed over to the police station's firearms section for inspection. The fugitive should be strictly arrested by the police to bring him to justice. The body was handed over to the deceased's son, Luo Yusheng, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>The Yiyuan Robbery Case Involves Reputable Merchants Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Believes Incident is Bizarre Holds Executive Committee Meeting to Discuss Response</h3>
<p>Zhang Zuming, shareholder of Ruichangshun Hardware Store, Zhuang Jimeng, small owner of Zhuangyuanda Trough Workshop, and Wang Lianyou, a salesman in the hardware department of Jue Li Foreign Firm, were accused by the French police of conspiring to rob a large sum of money from the Yiyuan Racecourse. On the 17th of this month, they were arrested and sent to the Second District Local Court for interrogation. It was reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that after the incident occurred, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association received letters from Ruichangshun Hardware Store and Zhuang Yuanda Trough Workshop Master Zhuang _ Zhou, proving that on the day of the incident, Zhang Zuming visited the racetrack in Jiangwan. He met Dong Zhengqing, comprador of Lu Lin Foreign Firm, and Chen Zhiding, Lin Pengfei, managers of Wanyi Import Department, and Hu Senfu, manager of Shengchang Hardware Iron Line, all of whom can be consulted. Zhuang Jimeng went home from Rui Xinghang at noon on that day and did not go out, which can be guaranteed by his neighbor Zhou Juxing and other merchants. Wang Lianyou was also guaranteed by Hu Yuanxiang of Zheng Daxing Firm that he did not go out that afternoon, which can be witnessed by the second landlord, surnamed Lu. The association believes that Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, and Wang Lianyou all have wealth and occupations. According to common sense, they would never be involved in banditry. At the time of the incident, they were each at a specific location and had people who could prove it. The accusation of conspiracy is bizarre. The association believes that this case is of great importance to the safety of the lives and property of Shanghai residents. It has been decided to convene an emergency committee meeting at 5:00 PM on the 21st of this month (today) to discuss response methods and immediately send letters to the French Consul General and Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession, asking them to pay attention and asking the police to handle the case with special caution to avoid wrongful accusations.</p>
<h3>Shi Luyi Died of Alcohol Poisoning While Negotiating a House, He Drank Excessive Alcohol at a One-Month-Old Celebration and Lost His Life</h3>
<p>Shi Luyi, a 26-year-old insurance merchant from Wuxi, residing at 1925 Jing'an Temple Road, went to the Qin family's residence at 44 Yongquan Fang on the same road on the 17th of this month to celebrate the one-month-old of their child. Unexpectedly, Shi's enthusiasm for alcohol erupted, and he downed several cups in an instant, resulting in excessive drinking and extreme intoxication, causing him to lose his mind. Seeing his condition, his friends accompanied him home. Upon arriving home, he still hadn't recovered, so they sent him to the Labor Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate.</p>
<h3>Zhao Kong and His Disciples Return to Shanghai, Having Been Banned from Entering England, America, and Japan</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai on the "Canada" last night.</p>
<p>There are seven people in the group of master and disciples.</p>
<p>They are temporarily staying at the Astor House Hotel.</p>
<p>Zhao Kong, a monk, is an Englishman who converted to Buddhism, practices vegetarianism, chants scriptures, wears black robes and straw sandals, and is fully dressed as a monk. He previously traveled from China to England, but was banned from landing in London by the British government. He then crossed the Atlantic to America, but was also denied entry. He then went to Japan across the Pacific, but was again rejected. After traveling around the world, both East and West, without finding a place to stay, he had no choice but to return to Shanghai. He arrived in port last night. The reporter met him on the road and learned the details, which are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Both England and America Prohibit Entry</h3>
<p>Zhao Kong, the monk, originally named De Liu Pihsi Lincoln, is an Englishman who firmly believes in Buddhism. He was ordained in China and given the Dharma name Zhao Kong. His name is now written as Abbot Chao Kung Zhao Kong, and his attire has also been changed to straw sandals and monk's robes. He previously traveled from China to England with his disciples, first arriving in Liverpool, but was banned from entering by the British government. During World War I, he was suspected of having significant international connections. The British authorities detained him for five days and then expelled him from England. Zhao Kong then led his disciples from England to America, crossing the Atlantic to enter the New World. However, upon arriving in port, America also blocked and refused entry. Zhao Kong, being unwelcome in England and America, then changed course to Japan.</p>
<h3>Japan Also Refused to Allow Landing</h3>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, Zhao Kong, along with his disciples, transferred from Wen Gu Hua to the "Empress of Canada" of the Changxing Company, directly heading to Japan. He originally planned to stay temporarily in Tokyo, so he purchased a ticket to disembark in Yokohama and then take a train to Tokyo. When the "Empress of Canada" arrived in Japan, Japanese officials were notified. Upon arrival in Yokohama, the Japanese authorities advised Zhao Kong and his party not to land, indicating that the Japanese government could not accommodate them. Zhao Kong and his party had no choice but to take the original ship back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Names of the Seven Masters and Disciples</h3>
<p>Zhao Kong and his disciples, a total of seven people, include two male monks, Xuetuo Di Cerutti and Aisha Kefei Er Bscoffier, and four female monks, Foboli Fabre, Aisha Kefei Er, Meishi Xi Er Henschel, and Max Markus. Including Zhao Kong, there are seven people. They traveled in second-class cabin number 276 on the "Empress of Canada". The "Empress of Canada" finally arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 p.m. on the 19th. Zhao Kong and his party took a small steamship to Shanghai and landed at the New Customs Wharf.</p>
<h3>Staying at the Astor House Hotel and Refusing Visitors</h3>
<p>When Zhao Kong and his party were en route to Shanghai from Japan, a telegram was sent to Shanghai in advance, booking rooms at the Astor House Hotel and notifying old friends in Shanghai. Therefore, last night when Zhao Kong and his disciples arrived in port, many friends and monks came to the customs wharf to welcome them. Zhao Kong disembarked, and the Astor House also sent people to pick them up. They had a lot of luggage. That night, they opened rooms 205 and 208 at the Astor House Hotel. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter saw Monk Zhao Kong and two of his disciples on the Bund, wearing black robes and straw sandals, holding Buddhist beads in one hand and an umbrella in the other, talking and walking with the two disciples, who were also dressed in monk's robes. When someone offered a visiting card, Zhao Kong declined to meet, saying he didn't want to make any statements.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the corpse was carried into the Ling Shi office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor dispatched by the First Special Court, arrived at the office to examine the body. According to Qian Libao's statement, a local resident, 27 years old, said that he was also drinking at the Qin family's house that day. When the deceased arrived, they were already finishing the meal. The deceased sat at the same table with him and drank four cups of Shaoxing wine in a row. Suddenly, he lost his mind, threw the wine pot on the ground, and even broke the bamboo chopsticks. But he came to negotiate about the house with the host, not for the one-month-old celebration. According to the deceased's mother, Shi Hua's statement, Mr. Guo concluded that the deceased Shi Luyi, male, had died from drinking too much alcohol and being poisoned. The body was handed over to the deceased's mother, Shi Hua, with a written guarantee, to take back for coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Fire in Yangjia Zha, Two Children Burned to Death, Suspected Arson Due to Unsuccessful Extortion</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening at around 7 o'clock, a fire broke out at No. 40 Yangjia Zha in Xinbeimen. The police on duty at the scene discovered it and reported it to the station, which relayed it to various fire brigades. They immediately dispatched fire engines to the scene to extinguish the fire. Liu Yunfang, the head of the first district and second precinct, along with police chief Li Fuyi and others, arrived at the scene to maintain order. The fire lasted for about an hour. Besides No. 40 being completely destroyed, it also spread to the neighboring houses and the back building of No. 40, where Xu Ziliang, a Suzhou tailor, lived with his two-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter. They were sleeping early and were unable to escape, resulting in their tragic death by fire. Xu's wife witnessed the tragic death of her two children and was in unbearable pain. She tried to throw herself into the fire in the street but was stopped by bystanders. After the incident, they searched for the source of the fire and found that the house was previously Zhao Cai's Dacheng Coal Shop, which was now taken over by Zhang Guisheng and renamed Fuxing Shop. The shop was rented to Xu Ziliang, who established a tailoring shop. According to Xu's apprentice, Feng Caozhang, he and his master's wife were having dinner downstairs when the fire broke out upstairs. The master's wife immediately went upstairs to save the children, but the ladder was already on fire. Judging from the way the fire started, it seemed to have started from the toilet, and arson was suspected. It was said that several days ago, when they held an opening ceremony, local gangsters demanded expenses but were unsuccessful. It is unknown whether it was revenge. Feng Caozhang was taken to the station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbery and Murder Case, Trial Concluded, Awaiting Scheduled Sentencing</h3>
<p>The bandit Xue Hongqing, 27 years old, from Gao Miao, Pudong, colluded with four other fugitives including Zhu Hongqing (also known as Xin), on the evening of April 7th, at around 7 p.m., armed with weapons, robbed Wan Tai Timber Company at 386 Xie Xu Road in the Chinese-controlled area of ​​Shanghai. They obtained the loot and fled into the French Concession, running north along Ma Lang Road. In front of the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, the victim chased after them, shouting "Thief!" Two Chinese constables No. 366, and No. 84, one Vietnamese constable No. 166, one Western constable and detectives Jiang Changwen, Geng Quanchang and Xu Qintang heard the noise and rushed to catch them. The bandit Xue opened fire to resist arrest, and the other bandits scattered and fled. The police officers also drew their guns and returned fire. Bullets flew everywhere. Ma Genquan, a plasterer from Pudong who lived in Tan's house in Xin Qiao Tou in the Chinese-controlled area, had finished working at the Jiu Ji Construction Company on Jiaozhou Road in the Northern part of the city and was returning home with two companions. As they passed by the area, Ma was hit by a stray bullet in a vital spot and died instantly. The bandit Xue continued to fire along the road and fled into the dark alley of Fugui Fang, 760 Ma Lang Road. He was also shot in 11 places on his body and fell to the ground. Detective Tian rushed up and captured him, seizing a pistol and five bullets. The police station immediately sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Ma's body was carried to the morgue, and the court was reported to send someone to examine and confirm the situation before collecting the body. This was reported in previous newspapers. Now that the bandit Xue has fully recovered from his injuries, he has been brought back from the French Concession Police Station and escorted to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday, Judge Wang Xuting, together with Prosecutor Wang Ren, specially opened the Fifth Criminal Court to conduct the trial. First, Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, explained the case and the police investigation process, and prosecuted the defendant according to Article 282 of the Criminal Law for murder, and presented the pistol and bullets to the court. Subsequently, the Chinese, Western, and Vietnamese constables and detectives who were present at the scene of the pursuit testified about the situation at the time. During the interrogation, Xue confessed that he was invited by Zhu Hongqing, a fugitive painter, who first said he was going to gamble, and then handed him a pistol and went to rob. Later, when he fled to Ma Lang Road, he was shot and fell to the ground, and he was completely unaware of what was happening. He really did not know about the murder. He was evasive about opening fire to resist arrest. The judge also summoned the owner of the robbed timber company, Zhang Guisheng, the owner of the coal shop who was injured by a stray bullet, and Ding Agen and Huang Meitou, who were companions of the deceased Ma Genquan, and questioned them one by one. After the interrogation was completed, Wang Shizong was appointed as the defendant's lawyer to defend him. The court then announced the end of the debate and awaited the scheduled sentencing. The defendant was still remanded in custody pending further notice.</p>

<h3>The Zhibo Association Will Be Reorganized into an International Exposition, with the Address Proposed to Be Moved to the Intersection of Nanjin Road and Shanxi Road</h3>
<p>The China participating in the Chicago Exposition Products Association in this port has been established since the year before last.

<h3>Representatives of Various Fishery Organizations Petitioned in Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the various fishery organizations in this city decided at the third joint meeting on the 15th of this month to appoint representatives to petition the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry and the Supervisory Yuan, implement the confiscation of all fishing vessels of the Dahua Fishery Company. The first batch of representatives, Xu Yifei, Jin Chuxiang, Shen Mingzhe, etc., went to Beijing by night train last night to petition. The petition is copied as follows: Petition for the joint petition to request the confiscation of Dahua Fishery Company's fishing vessels, so as to warn against imitation and maintain the sovereignty of the territorial waters. The case of奸商 He Shichang and others, colluding with the Japanese, fabricating the Dahua Fishery Company, and fraudulently obtaining fishing vessel licenses, concerns the territorial sea fishing rights and national defense security. The affiliated associations have jointly petitioned for the revocation of the licenses and the confiscation of the fishing vessels. Although the licenses have been revoked, the fishing vessels have not yet been confiscated. At this time of serious national crisis, He Shichang and others disregarded national humiliation and popular grievances, and acted as accomplices. If only the punishment of revoking the licenses is given, it is not enough to warn against evil and prevent future troubles. Moreover, it is heard that the company will change its face again and make a comeback. The affiliated associations are even more worried. They are deeply afraid that the lower situation will be blocked and difficult to reach the top. Therefore, on the 15th of this month, the third joint meeting was held, and Xu Yifei, Jin Chuxiang, Shen Mingzhe, etc. were publicly elected as representatives to petition in Beijing and present everything. We humbly request that you follow the public opinion and handle the matter fairly, and we will be eternally grateful. Sincerely presented,</p>

<h3>The Reputation of the Fortune Teller Wang Mingjiu</h3>
<p>Wang Mingjiu, a fortune teller from Shandong, has enjoyed a great reputation in North China for more than 20 years. All his predictions have been verified afterwards, and those who see him call him a strange person. The old celebrity Chen Jizhen once gave him a couplet, saying, "Hearing about the talented scholars from afar, I always approve of them, and give them to the poets to wash their eyes and see." He is so respected. Recently, he went to Beijing for business and passed through Shanghai. Old friends in Shanghai persuaded him to stay for a short time, so he set up a study at No. 204, 2nd Floor, Dahua Hotel, Xizang Road, British Concession. Those who like Zi Ping's technique often go to ask him, and his words are often accurate. Among the modern fortune tellers, he is truly rare.</p>

<h3>The Pre-Order for the Thirteen Classics Index Is About to Expire</h3>
<p>In the past, when children entered school, they recited the Four Books and Five Classics. They learned it as children, and they often never forgot it for the rest of their lives. Among the elderly people today, there are still such people. Since the change of the education system, it is generally known that the so-called Classics is not suitable for filling school textbooks, so they are abandoned. Therefore, few middle-aged people today can recite the Analects and Mencius. Not being able to recite such books is certainly not a shortcoming in life, but when we examine old news or use words and phrases, we cannot help but be related to the classics. If you want to check and read them occasionally, it takes time and is not economical. The Kaiming Bookstore has recently published the Thirteen Classics Index, which is used to check classic sayings. Libraries and researchers of Chinese studies in various places, and Chinese teachers in secondary schools, should each purchase one copy to prepare for checking at any time. The book will be published on August 1st of this year and is priced at 5 yuan and 5 jiao. Pre-orders are currently being sold, and the pre-order will end at the end of this month. The pre-order price is 3 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>

<h3>The Seamen's Union Will Change to a Director System</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the resignation of Yang Xiaotian, a standing committee member of the China Seamen's Union, the various members have resigned one after another, and no one is in charge, resulting in the de facto suspension of union affairs. The reporter interviewed a certain gentleman who returned from Beijing to attend the Public Movement Committee and talked about the internal disputes of the Hai Si Seamen's Union, which could not be resolved. However, the central government has decided to fundamentally reform the system of the union. In the future, the committee system will no longer be used, but the director system will be used. One director will be in charge of all union affairs, so as to be solely responsible and avoid disputes. It is heard that Wu Huanjun has been internally appointed as the director of the union, and will formally take office as soon as it is announced.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>How to Learn to Write Letters (Continued)</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we discussed why old-style letters are no longer suitable for today's use. Today, I will briefly describe how to learn to write the type of letter we need, in response to Mr. Jiang Ziyu's question. – The Editor</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the old-style letters have declined with the fall of the literati class. A new social relationship naturally has a new form of social interaction to match it. Letters are a form of communication between people, merely using the pen to speak. In the days when feudal status existed, those clichés and platitudes were naturally necessary. Now, in our complex social life, we naturally need a new set of tools for speaking. This is not surprising.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about what kind of letter writing we need.</p>
<p>First, because China has long been a republic, people are all equal "in law," and feudal status has long been abolished. Therefore, there is no reason to avoid direct address in letters and use substitutes such as "Your Excellency, Honorable Seat, Literary Desk, Your Feet," etc. Just call "Father" or "Dad" directly for "father," which is both respectful and more intimate. "Your Honor, Before Your Knees, Respectful Report" can all be omitted. When writing to the Chairman of the National Government, it is most appropriate to directly call him Chairman Lin, without having to write a long, complicated, and circuitous set of phrases, because although the Chairman is the head of state, he is a servant of the people. If there is something to criticize him for, you should naturally speak to him sincerely. Why be afraid of anything and have to defer to his "left and right?" In the past, the address often caused great jokes because it was too circuitous. Furthermore, the address in a letter is very important. If it is a love letter, using a cliché will make it lifeless. In the letters of young people today, one often sees the use of "Dear," "My Angel," "Darling," ┆┆, etc. Although these things are also elongating the address, they become more vivid and necessary, because lovers originally used this set of secret words when they met. If another address is used in the letter, not only will the other party be misunderstood and think that the love has changed, but the person writing the letter will not be able to help but write these secret words. Therefore, the principle of address today is "natural." Do not force it, and do not write something like "Worthy Wife" or "Husband," these lifeless and cold words. By analogy, it is most appropriate to call friends Brother Someone, Mr. Someone, or call them by their name directly. The rest can be done by analogy; I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>Second, avoid idle talk. Old-style letters must include "longing" and "seasonal greetings" after the address. These things are completely hypocritical, and there were not many learned people among the ancients who truly meant it. This is just a trick played by clerical secretaries, with no meaning to speak of. Our letters today must "get straight to the point." Say what you have to say right away, without saying it and not saying it, wasting the reader's time and the writer's paper and pen. If you have nothing to say, you can not write a letter. If a piece of paper is not full, write two lines. It is not necessary to fill the entire sheet to be considered qualified. As for letters between men of letters, lovers talking about love, you can say whatever you want, without regard to literary style and other things, because in today's habits, private letters are not allowed to be opened without permission. As long as both parties have time and are in the mood, they can speak freely without any scruples.</p>
<p>Third, avoid perfunctory and ambiguous language. For example, if a friend of yours is sick, you should no longer use perfunctory words such as "The lucky will be blessed by Heaven and can recover without medicine." You should tell him: "Please see a good doctor," "Go to the hospital," "Don't be careless." This is what shows your friendship. The recipient of the letter will also have more advice, which will benefit the sick person. In addition, if someone else's parents die, you should not use phrases such as "Blessings in life, smiles in the afterlife" to console his family. If you have feelings, you can sigh a few sentences according to your feelings, otherwise, you don't have to say much, because this kind of perfunctory socializing is not only too much in classical Chinese, but also in vernacular Chinese, if used blindly, it will become a cliché. This is not only annoying to read, but sometimes hurts the friend's heart. Why bother?</p>
<p>Fourth, although the letter format values free writing, the paragraphs must be clear and the language must be coherent. That is to say, it should be divided into paragraphs, with each meaning forming a separate paragraph. Do not include several meanings in one paragraph. This is originally a rule of rhetoric and is not unique to letter writing, but it is especially appropriate for letter writing because of the complexity of social life today. It is not uncommon for people in business to receive ten to hundreds of letters a day. If it is written vaguely, it will not be enough to spend the whole day reading letters. This point should be especially noted.</p>
<p>Fifth, Chinese people have a major problem with writing letters, especially in the past, which is that they have no concept of time and often do not write the date. Although this point seems to have nothing to do with the letter format, it is actually not the case. The most important thing in a letter is its relationship with time, especially in letters of affection and business. In business matters, sometimes because of the error in time, important things can be delayed. In matters of affection, because time has passed, true feelings cannot be expressed at the appropriate time. We should pay attention to the concept of time.</p>
<p>In summary, the above are just a few key points to learn how to write letters. This genre has now become a very good harvest in modern Chinese literature. There are many things that can be used as references, such as Ydong's "Vernacular Letters," Guanghua's "Modern Celebrity Letters," Nanqiang's "Practical Vernacular Letters," Gao Guang's "Zhou Zuoren's Letters," and other</p>
<p>epistolary novels, which can all be read. But we do not advocate using these things as templates, because people's conversations originally have no set norms. Letters are written conversations, so how can one learn to speak like a parrot? The best way to learn to write letters is to communicate with people more. You can practice yourself in this aspect, and at the same time learn some of your own lack of experience from the incoming letters. Learning to write letters is like learning to swim. To learn to swim, you have to go into the water. It is not enough to just read the swimming guide. I hope Mr. Jiang can understand this point!</p>

<h3>Misty Records of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Readers, imagine: An entire train car is filled with clothes, just to provide for the Empress Dowager's wardrobe for a short season. What would be the scale of the imperial wardrobe in the inner court? How substantial would its contents be? The author specifically repeats this point to remind you!</p>
<p>Since the Empress Dowager had so many dragon robes, each new one was only worn for a few days on average before being put aside. It seemed that her clothes could be kept forever as a memento. But these clothes had a destined fate. Except for a small part that she gave to me, all that she owned would be buried in her tomb after her death! Indeed, after her death, those countless clothes were all buried underground, regardless of whether they were beautiful or ugly. This custom was not unique to the imperial family; all Chinese who worshiped Buddhism did the same. They believed that after death, one still had to wear clothes, otherwise, the souls of the dead would only be naked. But there was an exception: any clothing made of fur, whether trimmed with fur or fully lined with fur, was never buried, because there was a legend that if the family of the deceased buried fur clothing in the tomb, the deceased would be reborn as an animal. Of course, descendants never wanted their deceased loved ones to become silver rats, gray rats, foxes, or sables. Thus, fur clothing was spared from disaster!</p>
<p>(9) The Imperial Kitchen</p>
<p>This time, the Empress Dowager's "clothing," "lodging," and "transportation" can be considered to have been resolved satisfactorily. What about the most important issue – the issue of food? In the palace, it was of course as luxurious and elaborate as possible, but on the train, it had to be a little lacking! The first reason was the limited space. Even so, four entire cars on our imperial train were dedicated to serving as the Empress Dowager's temporary imperial kitchen. (63)</p>
<h3>Old Lang Bodhisattva</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>There is a clay idol backstage in the theater, with a white and fair face, wearing a yellow robe. The actors worship him very piously and call him Old Lang Bodhisattva. According to Li Yu's Ten Plays, The Legend of the Halibut, when the cast enters, it is said:</p>
<p>Every religion has its own leader.</p>
<p>The God Erlang is the leader of our acting, just like Confucius of Confucianism, Buddha of Buddhism, and Lao Tzu of Taoism. Our teacher is extremely efficacious and very impatient, unlike the leaders of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism who are all tolerant and do not remember people's minor faults. If there is something unclear or unknown in the troupe, he will detect it. Major faults will bring disaster or blessings; minor faults will cause illness or misfortune. You must keep this in mind and never violate his taboos.</p>
<p>So the god is the God Erlang. The character "Erlang" is similar to the character "Old", perhaps a corruption over time. However, the God Erlang of Guan Kou in Investiture of the Gods has nothing to do with drama. Therefore, Ji Xiaolan believed that "the god worshiped by the actors is Emperor Ming of Tang, because they are children of the Pear Garden." However, An Ci-xiang believed that "it is Emperor Zhuangzong of Later Tang, not Emperor Ming." This is because the History of the Five Dynasties by Ouyang Xiu has a biography of court actors, and Emperor Zhuangzong was the first noble to perform dramas, so it is especially appropriate to worship him. Yang Zhangshou's Miscellaneous Records of Beijing Dust says: "The Old Lang God's surname is Geng, and his given name is Meng. In the past, when children learned singing and dancing from a teacher, they would often see a little Lang, who was extremely handsome and intelligent. He made all the Langs jealous and suspicious, and he was certainly not one of their classmates. He would always be present when they practiced, or gather the Langs and call out their names, but he was never there. After the Langs practiced with him, they enjoyed playing with him, and their intelligence would suddenly increase when they saw him. Therefore, they were surprised by his divine nature and created an image of him to worship."</p>
<p>This theory is quite unreliable, and Zhang Sheng himself does not believe it very much. However, it is said that the people of Wu prohibit mentioning dreams in the morning, especially the actors, because they consider it a taboo to mention the god's name. It is also said that the Pear Garden Guild Hall in Kuixiang Lane, inside the Guide Gate of Guangzhou City, is called the Old Lang Temple. There is a stele that records the affairs of the Old Lang God in great detail. I wonder if it still exists today? Does the inscription have a definite description of the Old Lang's surname, place of origin, and residence? I hope that the people of Guangdong can provide proof of this.</p>
<h3>Snake Catcher</h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>According to the snake catcher, "The most venomous of snakes is the pipa snake, which is transformed from a turtle." A few years ago, the Wang family across the street raised a large turtle. One day, it suddenly disappeared. They searched everywhere but couldn't find it. They didn't know that the turtle had crawled into a sewer hole and was squeezed by a crevice in the rock. After crawling for a long time, it shed its shell and became a venomous viper. When the weather is humid, it often hisses. People who are exposed to its venomous atmosphere feel unwell and become ill. It is as terrible as a green gas cannon.</p>
<p>The snake catcher was naked from the waist up and wore blue cloth shorts. He mixed the medicinal herbs with saliva and smeared them on his hands, arms, and bare areas. He blew a snake-charming whistle, and soon a venomous viper entered his blue cloth bag. He asked the owner for thirty dollars and went to the second house to catch snakes. The snake-bite medicine he carried, priced at two dimes per inch, was quickly sold out. His art of making money is not bad!</p>
<p>I think that in Chinese society, the land area is very large, but there are also many venomous snakes. Especially in the three northeastern provinces, there is a pipa snake that is more venomous than that venomous one. I wonder if there is a skilled snake catcher who can eliminate harm for the people and the country.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirty – Watching Mournful Geese, Burying Heads in Guarding the Territory, Bullet Pierces Strong Arm, Blood Stains Isolated City</p>
<p>As he said this, although it was dark, and he knew that his brothers could not see his expression, he had a faint smile on his face, and continued: Let him try this time, and make sure that none of them can go back? Do you understand? This company of brothers had been trained by Yin Deren for many years, and they knew that when Yin company commander spoke and acted, he had to be thorough and could not be ambiguous. So they all answered in unison, "Understood." Yin Deren had nothing else to say, shouted "Right turn, forward march," and led a company of brothers out of the fort gate. When they reached the first trench, they shouted the order to spread out, and the brothers, each carrying guns and ammunition, successively went down into the trench. Yin Deren came down into the trench, looked up at the sky, and the layers of stars, in the bleak cold sky, were slightly shaking, as if blown by the cold wind, and they were all a little thin. He wore gloves, raised his hand, and touched his face, and felt that the rough thread of the fabric rubbed against his skin, only feeling numb, and his skin was frozen and unaware of the pain. He wanted to take off his gloves and rub his hands to warm up, but then he thought that if the brothers took off their gloves and rubbed their faces with their hands, wouldn't they be cold too? If they also learned to rub their faces, they would all put down their guns and not fight. So he endured all the cold himself, and quietly sat in the trench, waiting for the enemy to come, and then he would meet them. But all he heard was the sound of wind blowing snow, rustling. Looking up, the heavy night, with the stars around, was connected to the earth, and people were stuck in the middle of the black hole. In the middle of the universe, it seemed that everything was dead, and Yin Deren himself felt that his heart was dead too. In that extremely boring time, he stretched out his hand to his pocket, and had some intention of smoking a cigarette, but what he touched was not a cigarette case but a matchbox. (414)</p>
<h3>My Views on Lovebirds in Chaos</h3>
<p>— Ke Er</p>
<p>The Yong'an Music Society rehearsed "Lovebirds in Chaos" at the Carlton. The reporter arrived at 7 o'clock to catch a glimpse of the whole picture. The society is full of talent, which is really gratifying.</p>
<p>In the play, the protagonist, Ling Xiao, sings, acts, fights, and performs martial arts, shouldering heavy responsibilities everywhere. Only someone with artistic talent as profound as Mr. Guo Linshuang can be competent. That evening, in the scene of reading a book, Mr. Guo sang Sanskrit, with ups and downs, with the wonderful taste of bitterness turning sweet. The farewell scene used a large flute to set off the acting, and every gesture and every footstep was measured. The unyielding strength when he was assassinated and captured, and the humility when he was humiliated by the Fifth Aunt, were all vividly conveyed, with sound and color. After the famous young martial artist Dong Sheng, this gentleman is the only one I have seen. No amateur can surpass him. Ms. Zheng Qianru removed the role of Bai Zhenzhu and is excellent in voice, appearance, and art. The section of scolding Yu Lang has the charm of chewing stamens and blowing fragrance. Her caring and meticulousness when administering medicine is innocent and charming and can be molded. Zheng Liu-jun's Coral has a particularly beautiful appearance, her eyebrows and eyes are like a person in a painting, her movements are graceful and light, and her coquettishness is adorable. In the scene of playing tricks on Ling Xiao, her dialogue is fluent, and her eyes and eyebrows speak volumes. The love scene has reached its peak. It is a pity that there are not many scenes for her, making people feel that she is not using her full potential. Mai Youyun's Luo Jun's iron voice is powerful, and he vividly portrays the Sand King's demeanor. Tang Zhenzhi's Bai Qingfeng's expressions are dignified and his singing and acting are well-done. Other actors, such as Lin Chengtai and Liu Shengchu as the farmer couple, Liang Yimin as the boatman, and Ms. Su Huiying and Cheng Yujian as Xiao Huan, either excel in humor or in singing and acting, adding brilliance as green leaves, complementing each other. After feasting my eyes, I write this down as above.</p>

<h3>Small Notes on Planting Flowers</h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>It is difficult to grow a few flowers yourself in Shanghai. Because it is not easy to find a piece of open space in the pigeon-like residential area, and if you find a piece of land but cannot find soil, it is still in vain. But there are so few parks in Shanghai, and living in the side building, you can't find a bit of natural atmosphere no matter how hard you look. Outside the window are concrete houses, concrete walls, and strips of fiery red corrugated tiles across the smoke-black sky. There is not a branch of green leaves, and you cannot hear the call of a bird. How boring this day is! So, plant a few flowers yourself. Yes, you have to plant a few flowers yourself to remedy this defect. I bought a few packets of flower seeds from Sincere Company. Naturally, I picked the flowers that I liked the most. I ran back wanting to plant them immediately, but many difficulties hindered me. Finding land, finding mud, and all kinds of problems came together, and I couldn't solve them for a while. Open space? Land in Shanghai is expensive. Who would leave you a piece of land to plant flowers? What about soil? Nearby there is only a garbage dump, so the soil contains broken copper, rotten iron, and torn leather! Impurity is still a small matter, and it also stinks terribly. But planting flowers has become an irrepressible natural impulse. If I don't plant these few packets of flower seeds, it's like carrying something on my mind. So yesterday I had to make a decision to choose a location on the drying platform. The soil was dug up next to the railway. I wrapped it in newspaper and brought it home. Although the soil quality is still good, it is still not very pure. Small glass and tinplate often prick your fingers painfully. Naturally, the soil cannot be too wet. After sowing, cover a thin layer of soil on top. It cannot be too tight either, or the small buds will not be able to penetrate.</p>
<p>It took me two full hours to complete all the sowing work. When I returned to the room and looked at the flower patterns on the flower seed bags again, I couldn't express the joy in my heart. I thought: From now on, I have a little more to do every day. Early this morning, I went to the drying platform to water it once and looked at it carefully for a while. I thought to myself: How soon will two small sprouts pop out here?</p>
<h3>Month Roses</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>"Flowers bloom in all four seasons, exhibiting their beauty monthly," this is Song Qi's praise of the month rose. The month rose is an evergreen shrub, similar to the rose. Some say it is a variant of the rose. Its stems are creeping and thorny, and it blooms monthly, hence its name. Commonly known as the "Monthly Red," the *Qun Fang Pu* (Record of the Myriad Flowers) states: "The month rose, also known as Shengchun (Victorious Spring), Shoukui (Lean Guest), and Douxuehong (Snow-Fighting Red), comes in three colors: red, white, and light red."</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Cultivating flowers takes a year, admiring them lasts ten days." This is because nurturing flowers is extremely difficult, and the budding stage is fleeting. However, if one plants a month rose, it will bloom continuously, allowing for prolonged appreciation, and it can also be enjoyed as a potted plant. However, potted plants can only flower once or twice, as the limited soil nutrients prevent continuous blooming.</p>
<p>In the past, Su Shi had a poem about the rebirth of the month rose: "The secluded flower inherently blooms in spring, its temporary withering like the eclipse of the moon." This analogy is exquisite. Yang Wanli also wrote: "One tip already holds carmine ink, four breaks still contain jade fluff." This vividly describes the flower's form. There is also a line that says: "It blooms thirteen times in a leap year."</p>
<p>I do not recall who wrote it.</p>
<p>The *Mianyun Xinhange Biji* (Notes from the Mianyun Xinhange) contains a section on month roses. I have adopted it as material: "The month rose has a thousand forms and a hundred colors. Wang Tianyi of Jiangxi was a man of elegance and refinement. He sought out over a hundred varieties of month roses, all of which were excellent. Those of slightly lower quality were not even counted. He had a concubine from Yangzhou who was skilled in cultivation, having come from a family of horticulturalists. When Tianyi traveled to Jiangdu, he learned of her exceptional skill in grafting month roses and acquired her as a concubine for a large sum of money. Later, Tianyi began writing a treatise on month roses, but he passed away before completing it. A friend of his, a Mr. Zhang, who was quite fond of the flower and shared Tianyi's passion, wished to consult with the concubine, study the varieties of the flowers, and learn the methods of grafting, so as to complete the treatise. The concubine was willing, but before ten days had passed, some relatives made slanderous remarks. Mr. Zhang sighed and said: 'This is an elegant pursuit, yet it is being tainted with impure reputations. If I were to disgrace Tianyi's honor, I would not be a true friend.' He then ceased visiting the Wang family. The concubine was illiterate, so the treatise was abandoned. Those who heard of it all expressed regret. This occurred in the mid-Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. The concubine had no children. The wife had one son. It is said that the family's fortunes declined, and he has since become a gardener, presumably inheriting the concubine's skills."</p>

<h3>China Wins Against Citibank</h3>
<p>China won against Citibank today and yesterday with a score of nine to six. Because the first group was completely defeated in three straight sets, it had a significant impact. Otherwise, a major victory would have been certain. Wang Wenzheng was playing in a tournament at the Chinese Tennis Club, so Sun Linfang was paired instead. Both experience and skill were inferior, and Qiu Feihai had no opportunity to use his skills. Little Schuyer has improved compared to before. Hines's pressure shots and half-volley balls were very powerful. Qiu and Sun were in a difficult situation everywhere. Guo and Ma won two to one, which was the most clear-cut. The third group's Zhou Guanjun and the fifth group's Cheng Yize and Tang Yongchun all won in three straight sets, which was the most brilliant and added a lot of color to the score. The full results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Qiu Feihai Sun Linfang (China) Four to Six　Four to Six　Six to Eight　Little Schuyer　Hines (Citibank) Zero to Three Loss</p>

<h3>Quanzhou Civilian High School: Coastal Walking Group to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Quanzhou Civilian High School in Fujian, to stimulate students' scholarship and examine the political, economic, educational, and cultural customs and traditions of various regions, has organized a China Coastal Walking Group. More than twenty people have joined, with a well-organized internal structure. They departed from Quanzhou at the beginning of last month, passing through Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and Hangzhou, and were well received by local party and government authorities. They originally planned to come to Shanghai immediately. It is now reported that they are proceeding to Beijing via the Yong-Hang National Highway and are expected to arrive in Shanghai within two to three days. The group plans to pass through Shanhaiguan and various passes of the Great Wall before returning to Tianjin to take a ship to Hong Kong, and then walk back to Quanzhou via Guangzhou. The journey is expected to take four months, a magnificent undertaking in the educational field.</p>

<h3>The Classical Chinese Movement in Primary and Secondary Schools (3)</h3>
<p>— Wang Maozu</p>
<p>(6) Mr. Wu said that the initial Chinese language teaching materials were not dry and barren. He has, in the past, used "speeches, propaganda pieces, or essays by Chairman Chiang, the Central Party Headquarters, and veteran party and state leaders" as teaching materials, and many works of vernacular literature that are widely circulated in magazines and newspapers can also be used as teaching materials. Indeed, when I was in secondary school, I would immediately select such articles, have them printed, and distribute them for teaching, such as Chairman Chiang's letter to students across the country, which was recited throughout the school. However, essays tend to be specialized and difficult for students to understand, and propaganda pieces are too lengthy and better suited for reading than close study. As for insightful works, such as Mr. Wang Jingwei's "Morning Class Picture," "Revolutionary Courage," and "Zhi Xin's Personality," all should be selected as teaching materials. However, there are very few such texts, and in the three years of junior high school, at least two articles per week are needed, totaling at least eighty articles per year. Attention must also be paid to the structure of the text, and various interests related to national spirit, ethical beauty, intelligence, physical education, politics, and social interaction must all be considered. If materials are selected from magazines and newspapers according to the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry, even those with extensive teaching experience will find it difficult to find enough, especially for first-year teaching materials. Recently, after briefly reviewing the Chinese language textbooks for junior high school, the materials for the first and second grades are particularly complex, including translated articles and lengthy, awkward pieces. The section on Jingyang Gang from Water Margin is almost always selected. While the depiction of Wu Song fighting the tiger is vivid and commendable from an artistic perspective, there is a sentence in it: "What bird am I afraid of?" When the teacher reaches this sentence, how should it be explained? If I am falsely accused of being outdated, then, at least, even if there are female students present, there is no need to avoid it. However, in addition to technique, Chinese language teaching also contains the function of cultivating and improving language, which must be considered. This article is widely studied, almost regarded as a classic of Chinese literature, which I consider to be a waste and an abuse. (7) Mr. Wu said that in elementary school, narrative and reasoning articles like "those who participate in teaching are like hands" are truly "treating silk, only to make it more tangled" and "merely confusing people." He believes that classical Chinese in elementary school should be like Ouyang Xiu's "Record of Raising Fish" and Xue Fucheng's "Record of Watching the Paris Oil Extinguishing," selecting more lyrical and descriptive articles that are simple, interesting, and not like the awkward and obscure texts of the Zhou Proclamations and Yin Plates. In reality, in terms of writing style, such texts are already vernacular, just with a different tone. If Mr. Wu can acknowledge this point, then our opinions would not be very different, so why debate?</p>
<p>Mr. Wu fears that the proliferation of "zhi hu zhe ye" will only make things more confusing. I wonder if "ma di ya na a ne de" will increase the difficulty of teaching. If junior high school only teaches classical Chinese and uses vernacular literature as extracurricular reading (how the junior high school curriculum should be revised to simplify it is detailed in my book "Review and Improvement of the Secondary School System," which I will not elaborate on here), then within three years, even those with slightly dull talent will surely be able to understand it clearly. Now, because there are more vernacular teaching materials than classical Chinese ones, just as Mr. Wu said, it is a "four-not-like," and without a tool that can be used, how can one even begin to glimpse deeper literature? During the recruitment exam for the Central Political School the year before last, there was the following passage in the Chinese language test, asking students to add punctuation and translate it into vernacular Chinese:</p>
<p>"When Emperor Gao founded his dynasty, his eyes were not free. Filial Hui enjoyed the country for a short time." Most test papers punctuated it as:</p>
<p>"Emperor Gao founded his dynasty and said, 'Not free to give filial piety,' enjoyed the country for a short time Hui."</p>
<p>"Emperor Gao founded his dynasty and said, 'Not free to give filial piety to Hui,' enjoyed the country for a short time."</p>
<p>All of this can be evidenced by facts, not "imaginary creations."</p>
<p>(8) Mr. Wu cited the example of the imperial examination era, where only a hundred out of a thousand candidates from Jiangyin passed. This example may not be entirely accurate. The writing for the imperial examination, whether the eight-legged essay or the policy essay, all had a certain structure and formed a separate skill. Furthermore, there was a fixed quota, and those who were not selected cannot be considered incompetent. There were many people with outstanding talent who never passed the examination in their entire lives, so this is not enough to use as a counterexample. Learning classical Chinese is certainly slightly more difficult than colloquial language, but the degree of effort is definitely not as great as Mr. Wu said. As for the labor-saving effect of application, both readers, writers, and printers find it more economical. If using the ear instead of the eye, then there is no need for classical Chinese. If the eye must be used, then classical Chinese is still useful, because classical Chinese is a shorthand for vernacular. Language emphasizes sound and meaning, while classical Chinese, in addition to sound and meaning, also has form that can be observed. For example, to say "this student or that student," classical Chinese only needs "this student or that student," which is immediately clear. How labor-saving is that? This is only speaking from the perspective of a tool, and there is no need for debate. Furthermore, there is also the spirit of our ancestors residing in it. If one insists on sweeping it away like fallen leaves, then I, who devote my efforts to education, would never dare to agree.</p>
<p>In summary, the decline of writing is not necessarily related to the decline of the nation. If there were no such connection, why would I have to be so insistent? Today, there are countless national affairs and countless educational problems. The wise recognize the greater issues, and the unwise recognize the smaller ones. I only recognize the smaller ones. Furthermore, due to my naturally straightforward nature, I may have offended others in a moment of enthusiasm. However, I hope that Mr. Wu and the officials of the Ministry of Education will understand my good intentions. Let the public debate the rights and wrongs, and I will never argue again from now on. (End)</p>
<h3>Statement After Reading Wang's Article "The Classical Chinese Movement in Primary and Secondary Schools"</h3>
<p>— Wu Yinyan</p>
<p>The arguments in the first half of Mr. Wang Diancun's article "The Classical Chinese Movement in Primary and Secondary Schools" published in the newspaper are very difficult to grasp. The second half also did not refute my claim that classical Chinese need not be taught in primary schools and that vernacular literature itself cannot be denounced as destroying thought. Therefore, I don't want to speak again. However, there are a few points that must be clarified.</p>
<p>(1) Foreigners' attitudes towards Chinese culture are just like Chinese people's attitudes towards their own culture. Many people admire Chinese antiques, while many others consider them to be worthless. Regarding writing, Dewey and Monroe said that Chinese writing is too difficult to learn and should be reformed. The League of Nations Educational Investigation Group also suggested that Chinese writing should be studied and improved. At the same time, there is a group of foreigners with ulterior motives who cater to or indulge the old society, so they often encourage Chinese people to study the classics and Confucianism and respect Chinese scholars (this is the case in Hong Kong). In their view, preserving China's "national essence" is the same as preserving China's superstitions, opium, bound feet, etc. We should not be proud of this. Mr. Wang's citation of the views of a professor at Harvard University is naturally different from those of this group of people with ulterior motives.</p>
<p>(2) Of course, we cannot "reject words because of the person." The likes of Yuan Shikai, Zhang Xun, and Zhang Zongchang may be despicable people, but their words may be praiseworthy. However, during the rise of education, a group of enlightened scholars (?) advocated opening schools, while illiterate servants stubbornly defended the "Four Books and Five Classics," and the "Three Character Classic" and "Thousand Character Classic" were also included in their defense. They denounced the schools as foreign schools, raising their arms and glaring, wanting to destroy them to their satisfaction. Their intentions may not be worthy of much criticism, but their ignorance is deeply pitiful. Furthermore, the advocacy of Confucianism and the study of the classics by the likes of Yuan and Zhang was originally linked to their goals of "imperial rule" and "restoration." Not only was their ignorance extreme, but their intentions were even more damnable.</p>
<p>(3) He Jian and Chen Jitang advocated Confucianism, but they certainly did not force schools to study the classics. If you don't believe it, please send letters to Hunan and Guangdong to ask, and you will know. Or, you can look at the Ministry of Education's inspection report on Hunan education and the Guangdong Education Department's report to the Ministry of Education, which can also prove this claim.</p>
<p>(4) The advocacy of vernacular literature in primary schools originated in the Beijing Ministry of Education. The prohibition of classical Chinese in primary schools came from the former Great Academy. The order prohibiting primary schools from using classical Chinese to increase the burden on students is the most recent official document from the Ministry of Education and has nothing to do with Mr. Liu Dabai. I (a mere soldier) am even less capable of doing anything about it. Mr. Wang believes that ministry orders should be obeyed, so please do not express disobedience because of Mr. Liu and me.</p>
<p>(5) Primary school Chinese language textbooks cannot be edited perfectly, and the selection of materials cannot be entirely appropriate, which is undeniable. But in terms of word usage, we rarely use the word "cat" in our lives, but the word "cat" is commonly used in textbooks at home and abroad. Words like "gu ji" to describe sounds are of course best not used, but in children's dictionaries, if there are no other words to replace them, it is permissible to use them occasionally for the sake of the text. As for the story of the squirrel changing clothes, since it has the natural purpose of distinguishing colors and matching colors, there is certainly no need to consider other things. Because the purpose of primary school teaching materials is often simple and not complex. Furthermore, to pick out one or two words or one or two lessons as the disease of the entire textbook is not the attitude we should take.</p>
<p>(6) The industry and vocational sector advocates classical Chinese because of their clinging to old habits. We cannot sacrifice our own daughters because our mothers advocate binding our granddaughters' feet, nor can we welcome Puyi back or invite Yuan Shikai to be resurrected because the majority of ordinary people advocate the emergence of a "true emperor." To admit that new education has failed because the old society welcomes private schools that advocate classical Chinese is like admitting that the republic has failed because some people hope that the emperor will ascend the throne.</p>
<p>I have already said that Mr. Wang's views are not extreme, but the formulation of propositions and wording seem like those of an extremist. I hope that Mr. Wang, when expressing his views again, will first determine his own position, then see the other party's arguments clearly, and then speak. Otherwise, arguing about minor details and fighting a hundred years of ink-slinging lawsuits until one dies of old age may not make one understand what one is arguing about.</p>
<p>Finally, this is just an explanation, not a debate. I hope to share a laugh with Mr. Wang about it.</p>

<h3>Finance: Both English and American Silver Markets Rise, Premium Drops by 1.70 Yuan; Exchange Market Quite Good, Large Investors Frequently Purchase; Midday Situation Low and Then High</h3>
<p>The gold market initially fell yesterday due to the sudden rise in silver prices, but the market situation in the afternoon went from weak to tight, because the HSBC listed price did not change. The exchange market was quite good, and large investors still had a strong intention to buy. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in England and America rose uniformly, with the forward silver price on the gold and silver exchange rising by 2.8 to 3.3 fen. The exchange rate was flat, the London spot gold rose by half a penny, American cotton showed mixed rises and falls, and stocks fell by 1.4 yuan. Reports and Reuters news both stated that the New York Gold and Silver Exchange's forward silver market still benefited from the business silver profit tax, which was unrelated to general banking formal transactions and general hedging transactions. The over-the-counter preliminary transaction broke the 10 yuan mark and retreated to 0.89 yuan. There was enthusiastic buying to cover shorts, and the situation was quite stable. It opened flat and hovered around 9 yuan. Afterwards, the banks' appetite tended to increase, and they anticipated that the HSBC listed price would not change in England and America. The domestic market turned tight, and although Reuters reported that President Roosevelt had signed the Silver Act, it had no impact. Large investors in the market purchased actively, and the gold price broke through the 10 yuan mark. At this time, banks slightly sold near-term U.S. dollars, and there were still many supplies taking advantage of the trend, hovering around 10 yuan. The silver price reported from the Seattle night market only rose to 121, and the news of 125 had little impact. The market sentiment remained stable, the domestic market continued to tighten, there was also hedging activity, and it gradually rose, while large investors' intention to buy remained strong, and the gold price rose again. There were also rumors in the market that the Central Bank was opening spot transactions, and the market atmosphere was extremely good. Finally, Reuters reported that after President Roosevelt signed the Silver Act, the domestic tax commissioner, Haeferlin, also announced at the same time regulations for managing the collection of white profit tax on general silver bar transactions and announced the purpose of implementing the purchase of silver operations. The rising trend slightly weakened, but the demand in the market was still flat, so the midday was extremely stable. The red gold price was calculated at 1018.3 yuan. The midday market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1009.3 yuan, a decline of 0.41 yuan from the previous close. The opening price of goods was the same.

Overseas Chinese bought U.S. dollars for October at half a yuan, and the price stabilized. In addition, anticipating that the HSBC listing price would remain unchanged in England and America, Dadecheng, Shunmao, Yuqingyong, Fuchang, Huixiang, Hongli, Tianfeng, Dafayong, Qianchangxiangyuan, and others purchased in succession. Zhengjin bought U.S. dollars for October at 4375, gradually rising to 11.2 jiao. Bingxing, Hengtai, Tianfeng, and Fuxingyong came to sell, and retail investors all pushed down and retreated to within 10 yuan, but because Hengyu still purchased, it mostly rebounded. Citibank sold U.S. dollars for September at 3125, Liangxing and Dadecheng supplied bars, and the price dropped to 0.097 yuan. The settlement price reported from the Seattle night market only rose to 125, which had little impact. Zhengjin Overseas Chinese still bought U.S. dollars for October at 4375, and the situation was quite stable and gradually rebounded. The domestic market also gradually tightened, and there were many buyers in the market, and Fuchang, Futaihengyuan Yi, Hengyu, Tongfengheng, and Dadecheng competed to buy, stirring up the market, and it rose to 12.4 jiao. The Reuters news of the silver tax came, and Fuan, Wanxing, and others took advantage of the high price to sell, retreating to 1.7 jiao. Fuxingyong worked hard to maintain it, and the situation stabilized. The midday close was 1011.7 yuan, and the item was auctioned at 1.9 jiao. After the close, Qianchangxiang supplied, and the market situation was flat. It was found that the highest price in the afternoon was 1012.4 yuan and the lowest price was 1008.3 yuan, a difference of 4.1 yuan. As a result, it only fell by 1.7 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was calculated at 32.625 yuan because the HSBC Bank's U.S. exchange listing price did not change, which was equivalent to a premium gold price of 106 yuan and zero fen. Judging from the closing price, it was about 49 yuan, less than 2 yuan more than the previous close. The registration price for July was 1012 yuan, for August 1012 yuan, and the midday replenishment was 1012 yuan. The red gold price was calculated at 1018.3 yuan, about 9 yuan higher. Market transactions were still quiet, and Tianjin goods were about 10 yuan higher. The market situation was calm. It was rumored that the Central Bank had opened spot premium transactions, totaling 840 bars, at a price of 1010 yuan. Swap transactions were less frequent. Yuanshengyong paid Dadecheng 7.5 jiao, Fuxingyong paid Hengyu 9 jiao, and Huiyuan paid Yingfengheng a full 1.5 yuan, because the buyer paid 1.6 jiao for the item.</p>

After opening, it was flat. Then, anticipating that the HSBC Bank's listing price would be flat in England and America, market sentiment was boosted. Banks also purchased long-term US dollars, and exchanges between banks were frequent. The process gradually tightened, and the gold market stabilized. The market situation was quite good. Chinese merchants provided some supply, and hedging activities took place.

<h3>Settlement Period, Busy Collection and Release</h3>
<p>As the semi-annual settlement period for the financial industry approached, all kinds of items that needed to be sorted out were gradually completed in the most recent week. Therefore, the current large-scale collection and release of funds is mostly due to settlement. As for the market transaction situation and market sentiment, everyone is cautious due to the poor market atmosphere and difficult times, and there has been no new development. This has left the financial industry, which leads all industries, in a silent state, which is regrettable. Yesterday's foreign interbank lending rate seemed to be slightly lower by one point than the previous day, calculated at 0.06. It was the same in the morning and afternoon. The addition of headwater was still opened at 0.02 or 0.03. In the discount ticket transaction, over 4.1 million were transferred in the morning market, over 400,000 in new transactions, over 200,000 in the afternoon market, over 300,000 in small general meetings, over 1.3 million in banknotes were recovered, over 1.4 million were issued, and another 300,000 were shipped to other places. In the foreign mortgage loan transaction, over 1.4 million was newly done, but only 800,000 or 900,000 were redeemed. The source of foreign cash from customers was 300,000, and 400,000 was withdrawn. In terms of bank collection and release, foreign banks collected and released over 1.45 million in ticket funds, collected and released over 4.56 million in various goods exchange mortgage miscellaneous funds, collected and released over 1.56 million in settlement funds, and released 500,000 from the warehouse. Chinese banks collected and released over 2.45 million in ticket funds, collected and released over 5.34 million in various goods exchange tax mortgage miscellaneous funds, collected and released over 2.45 million in settlement funds, and there were many incoming and outgoing telegraphic transfers from other places. The detailed and accurate numbers cannot be investigated and are omitted. 500,000 were released from the warehouse. Japanese banks collected and released over 2.1 million in ticket funds, collected and released over 4.3 million in various goods exchange miscellaneous funds, collected and released over 1.78 million in settlement funds, and entered 400,000 into the warehouse. Money houses collected and released over 41 million in foreign public orders, collected and released over 3.9 million in foreign headwater funds, collected and released over 450,000 in various exchange funds, and collected 560,000 in cash. Looking at yesterday's market situation, in this semi-annual settlement period, existing businesses are making as much progress as possible in preparing for completion, and all transactions are truly rare. It is very sad that the market is so depressed. Also, the total number of exchanges in the clearinghouse on the 20th was 8,889,612.13 yuan, including 4,084,949.61 yuan in silver dollars and 4,811,222.52 yuan in exchange silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Minor Fluctuations in Subsidiary Currency</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the market, the Jiangnan small silver coins (small dollars) were still at 815 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, showing no rise or fall from the previous day. Trading volume remained insignificant, estimated at 7,000 jiao in the morning and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon. There was no news about the source or destination of the coins. Guangdong small silver coins were priced at 730 yuan in the morning and increased by one yuan in the afternoon, reaching 731 yuan. The difference between the two markets was only one yuan, a slight increase of only five jiao compared to the previous day's afternoon market. Trading volume reached 70,000 jiao in the morning and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins decreased by 1,000 wen, to 329,000 wen, with 40,467 strings of transactions, amounting to 12,300 yuan in exchange value.</p>
<h3>Securities: Minor Correction After Frequent Rises; More Short Covering Than Long Liquidation; Disparities in Near-Term and Long-Term Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market trend unexpectedly showed a minor correction. This was a natural occurrence after several days of rising prices. Some long positions were liquidated, but with the settlement date approaching (only four days away), the number of outstanding positions remained substantial. The potential for short squeezes could not be ruled out. Throughout the day, the trend gradually weakened with each transaction, and trading volume decreased, indicating a lack of eager buyers. Sellers were hesitant to aggressively short the market. The strength of buying was more evident. Speculators were not eager to sell. The trend throughout the day largely showed minor declines of one or two jiao per transaction. However, Jin Duan and Zheng Liu fluctuated unpredictably. The largest declines were in this month's Disarmament bond, down six and a half jiao, and next month's Zheng Liu, down seven and a half jiao. In contrast, the long-term Disarmament bond fell by only three and a half jiao, and this month's Zheng Liu by only three jiao. The significant difference between near-term and long-term contracts was due to long positions rolling over in the Disarmament bond and short positions rolling over in Zheng Liu, leading to an imbalance between long and short positions. This also suggests that there were still many short positions in Zheng Liu. The current trend might continue with sluggishness for another day or two, but a significant short squeeze is still likely to occur as the settlement date approaches.

<h3>New York Stock Market Initially Rises, Then Falls</h3>
<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm states: Yesterday (the 19th), the stock market opened strong but soon turned downward. Although the conference had concluded, the power of the Securities and Exchange Management Committee remained significant, and the selection of personnel was still undecided, causing traders to be cautious. Gold and silver stocks initially showed strength, with several reaching new highs for the year. However, the subsequent decline was also severe. Sugar stocks performed relatively well. The small exchange showed mixed results, with fluctuating bond prices. German bonds fell again. There were no significant changes in grains. The total volume was 850,000 shares (securities). Selling pressure increased slightly, and prices fell slightly, but the market sentiment remained firm. (Grains) Trading was sparse, leading to dampened sentiment. The situation for corn was serious, which should benefit wheat. Purchases could be made during the decline. Rainfall in wheat-producing areas had not altered crop conditions. Centralized buying had removed surplus goods from the market. (Cotton) Prices rose due to news of government allocations to purchase textiles for poverty relief. The quantity of textiles was not mentioned. Southern hedging and long liquidation in July were absorbed by the industry. (Rubber) The market was mediocre, with stable prices. (Sugar) The market saw some profit-taking, resulting in a slight rebound. Spot prices were very strong. There was hope that the reduction of tariffs on Cuban sugar would be implemented soon. The Dow Jones Indices are listed below:</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks  100.42  99.02  Down 1.40</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Marked Yarn's Rise Weaker</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains strong due to rising American cotton prices. Actual demand from North China remains constant, with ongoing purchases. Additionally, soaring prices for third-grade yarn have spurred speculative activity, further driving up market prices. However, some cotton yarn deliveries for this month are still under inspection. There were profit-taking long liquidations in the afternoon, causing market prices to ease slightly.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Spot Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>The marked yarn market opened stronger in the morning session due to rising American cotton prices, boosting investor confidence. Buying interest intensified, with prices for all months rising by one yuan. In the second session, news of a continued surge in third-grade yarn prices in the East (Japan) maintained strong market sentiment. However, by the close, reports of sluggish spot yarn trading softened prices by two to three jiao. As a result, prices for all months rose by three, five, six, eight jiao to one yuan and one yuan three jiao. The market opened strong again in the afternoon. By the third session close, news of a five-yuan decline in third-grade yarn prices triggered some selling pressure, causing prices for all months to fall by one, three, and four jiao. The total daily trading volume was 48,750 bales. Sales included 1,000 bales by Tong Min, 900 bales by Jifeng, 550 bales by Dafu, 2,450 bales by Daji, 1,400 bales by Mianchang, 950 bales by Gengfeng, 1,000 bales by Sen Yu, 1,650 bales by Changfeng, and 600 bales by Yicheng.

The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>June  181.2  180.7  180.7  Up 1.00  22,700</p>

<h3>Over 1,000 Bales of Spot Sales</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales were good. A total of 1,400 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day. Prices rose by five jiao to one yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 250 Guangdong 180 Mainland 325 Amoy 15</p>
<p>Trade 50 Tiansou 460 Wuhu 40 Northern Group 50</p>
<p>Wenzhou 20</p>
<p>The cotton market began to rise and fall, with the trend softening. However, foreign cotton prices rebounded. With ample supply of Han cotton available for delivery this month, buyers remained hesitant. As a result, market sentiment weakened in the afternoon. However, the bulls remained strong, and the amount of cotton absorbed was not fully released.</p>
<h3>Zheng Marked Cotton Futures Market Retraced</h3>
<p>The Zheng marked cotton market opened the morning session, following the rise in American cotton prices and tight supplies. Short covering occurred, but with some profit-taking, prices slightly decreased by five jiao. However, new cotton prices were relatively high, with results for each month increasing by five fen, one jiao, up to...</p>

<h3>Grains: Spot Flour Rises Due to Mill Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, the market for each month generally presented a flat and weak picture. With imported wheat quoted at a slight discount of four cents in Chicago and about one jiao less in Canada, the market for each month became quiet after the opening. Outside buyers also remained on the sidelines. However, with mills' selling sluggish, sentiment stabilized. The near-term contract was only slightly weaker, while the long-term contract was only weaker by 2.5 li. In the afternoon session, due to automatic covering by mills for this month's positions, opening prices stabilized. The number of sales for long-term contracts by Fu and Fu Mills was not large, which also stabilized sentiment. Later, as wheat futures rebounded, long-term opening prices improved. On the northern sales front, the attitude remained calm due to the abundant wheat harvests in the north and south. As a result, this month was unchanged, July was up 7.5 li, August was up 1 fen, September was up 5 li, October was up 7.5 li, and November was up 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Market Sees Stronger Buying Interest</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, the market for each month generally presented a flat and weak picture. With imported wheat quoted at a discount of about four cents to one jiao in both locations, the market for each month stabilized after opening. However, with customers' sales sluggish, the market remained flat and weak, with the decline being very slight, only one fen less than the previous day. In the afternoon session, traders temporarily held a stable outlook on standards due to the ongoing agricultural work in producing areas and the lack of abundant arrivals. Therefore, buying interest increased, and the market rose, with September rising about one fen compared to the previous day. As a result, each month from July to October rose by one fen. The spot wheat market was stable, showing no gains or losses compared to yesterday. Kainansuzhou, Mingguang, and Bengbu wheat was priced at 2.90 yuan, Taizhou and Nanjing wheat at 2.80 yuan, Caishiji and Changshu wheat at 2.70 yuan, Taipingfu wheat at 2.75 yuan, next 7 jiao, Baihegang at 2.71 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 2.78 yuan, next 7 jiao half, Pukou wheat at 2.75 yuan, next 7 jiao, Liuhe wheat at 2.80 yuan next 7 jiao, Penglai wheat at 2.70 yuan, next 6 jiao, Kunshan Lai at 2.778 yuan, and Hezhou wheat at 2.73 yuan, next 5 jiao, Changzhou wheat at 2.72 yuan, next 7 jiao Pizhouxing wheat at 2.71 yuan, with a total opening of 12,000 bags, purchased by Fu Zao Hua Mill.</p>
<h3>Superior Japonica Rice Continues to Improve</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources only from the 7th and 8th, (goods about 1200 to 1300 piculs). The late rice market is especially weak. The Ningbo merchants have only handled three or four shipments in total, amounting to approximately 400 to 500 packages. Higher quality late rice has continued to increase in price by several fractions of a cent. However, the price of goods from the central market and those included in the contract remain flat. The popularity of various merchants' superior japonica rice with the shop owners remains strong, and the market appears tight. Common grades from Suzhou, Tongzhou, and Nangang have increased by several fractions of a cent to over a cent. Dujian rice has also rebounded by five cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from the river regions were numbered 13th and 14th. Due to the clearing weather, the market for various colors held firm. High-quality white japonica rice barely held, while medium and lower grades were weak and close to a foot. Supply of thin rice was low, and sales were stable, with prices holding steady. White Yuan rice was weak. Yangdu indica and Fubu indica had balanced supply and sales, and prices were stable and weak. Guest-selected tip rice was peaceful and balanced.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Post-Festival Sugar Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight recovery in customs gold to 20.42. Coupled with sluggish actual sales, the association's asking price for No. 24 granulated sugar was 20 yuan and 6 jiao, but no transactions occurred. No. 8 and 9 brown sugar was priced at 15 yuan and 7 jiao, slightly negotiable. Taikoo B mark bagged sugar rose by five fen, to 20 yuan, 8 jiao, and 5 fen.</p>
<p>CW mark was 20 yuan and 4 jiao, DY mark was 20 yuan and 5 fen. HX was out of stock and the market was inactive. No. 1 domestic white sugar remained at 19 yuan and 1 jiao. Over 300 bundles of sliced indigo arrived earlier, with the asking price at 11 yuan. Merchants showed no interest in buying. Chaoqing and Shantou prices remained firm, and the difference between spot and future prices persisted. Recent destocking has stabilized the situation slightly, but dealers are still trying to resist price increases, so they are not quoting prices often.</p>

<h3>The Real Deal is Better</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Some people laugh, saying that they clearly have domestic goods but don't buy them, and instead buy foreign goods. Is it that this person lives too much in an ice room and their heart is frozen? Someone else says nearby: Now that it's summer, the weather is hot, and the desire to use domestic goods should also heat up. Actually, as Chinese people, we should use Chinese goods. No matter how hot the weather, we should use domestic goods. Even if the weather is cold, we should still use domestic goods. Spring, summer, autumn, winter, all four seasons, we should use Chinese goods at all times. When summer arrives, restaurants start hosting banquets, and the most proud thing for waiters is to desperately sell soda, beer, and orange juice. Friends, drinking is fine, but you must look at the brands. Don't satisfy your mouths and carelessly drink enemy goods or foreign goods, allowing thousands upon thousands of dollars to flow into the pockets of foreigners during this summer. I most admire one of my friends. The other day, at a banquet, the waiter brought several bottles of beer and soda. Just as he was about to pour them into the glasses, my friend said, "Wait a moment, let me take a look." He didn't realize until he looked that they were all foreign goods. My friend told the waiter to take them away and bring domestic goods. The waiter said they were all used up. My friend said, "If they're used up, go buy more, otherwise we won't use them." The waiter had no choice but to get some domestic beer, soda, and orange juice from a domestic goods company, and then everyone was at ease. We highly appreciate this kind of seriousness and rigor. I hope everyone will deal with these bad waiter types in this way. We especially admire two military men, one is Han Fuju, who recently issued an order in Shandong Province that if anyone passes off foreign goods as domestic goods, in addition to closing the store, they will also be fined double. This strict measure is like a blazing summer day, very satisfying. The other is Lu Diping. It is said that all the supplies in his home are now domestic goods. Recently, the buyer bought him many summer supplies, and he discovered one enemy good and two foreign goods. He became very angry and ordered these non-domestic goods to be returned. He also instructed domestic goods stores that they must not sell foreign goods again, otherwise they will be punished for deception. This decisive approach is also like a blazing summer day, making people cheer. This publication takes advantage of this summer season to publish a special issue on summer supplies, introducing many domestic goods to readers. I hope everyone will pay attention to using them, and at the same time, I hope domestic goods manufacturers will pay attention to improving them, so that both producers and consumers can benefit, which is the purpose of this humble publication. If everyone agrees, we can publish a second issue.</p>
<h3>A Model Summer Family</h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>It's difficult to be a model family, and it's even more difficult to be a model summer family. However, the family of economist Mr. Wang and educator Ms. Gao is even more exemplary in the summer and can be a model for promoting domestic goods. Their home is decorated very simply and plainly. Under bright windows and clean desks, thin curtains are hung, made of green Liberty cloth from the Sanyou Society, which is light and soft. Above them are Watsons electric fans, with gentle breezes that refresh the skin. Several small oscillating fans in the study are also Watsons products. When we visited this virtuous couple, they were reading side by side, both wearing Goose Brand undershirts from the Wuhe Factory, which were white and soft. The couple looked especially like celestial beings, exceptionally refined. Ms. Gao said that they both hated going shirtless in the summer, as it was both unhygienic and indecent. Therefore, the children at home are all dressed in undershirts and underpants. The other day, they took them to Wuhe to shop. In addition to buying undershirts, they also got some celluloid white geese, which made the children even happier. The children are asking us to buy them more undershirts again today. After everyone laughed for a while, Ms. Gao invited us to drink Watson's soda and then went to cool off in the back garden. Ms. Gao said: Although there are many trees and flowers here, mosquitoes are rampant at night. Samsung mosquito coils are very effective, so Samsung mosquito coils are a must-have in our home once summer arrives. Finally, they also talked about the problem of straw hats. Ms. Gao said that Mr. Wang's straw hat is a Huafu product. After he wore it, many friends praised it highly, so we recently bought a dozen to give to relatives and friends on the Dragon Boat Festival, feeling that it was more practical than any other gift. This approach is especially worth recording. After we said goodbye, we felt that such a couple and such a family were truly worthy of admiration.</p>
<h3>How to Purchase Summer Supplies</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhang</p>
<p>Dear readers, time passes so quickly, and summer has arrived again. During the summer, in addition to our general, ordinary life passing as usual, there is also a problem worth discussing that is before us, requiring us to study and solve it. If we don't study this problem and don't seek a solution, then it will not only have a close relationship with the survival of the entire domestic goods movement, but we ourselves may also encounter unfortunate circumstances. What is this problem? It is the "summer supplies" problem that deserves attention.</p>
<p>We should always pay attention to the clothes we wear, but in the summer, it is especially worth discussing, because in this season, to be honest, the things we use are indeed more complex than in any other season!</p>
<p>For this reason, the question of "how to purchase summer supplies" is before us. How should we solve this problem? I have two ideas below, which I am now publishing in the hope that they will provide some insight:</p>
<p>(1) Families should purchase epidemic prevention supplies. Everyone believes that "epidemics" are very terrible, but epidemics occur most often in summer. Therefore, in the summer, every family should purchase some epidemic prevention supplies, such as stinky disinfectant, Asian Lin Sand, medicated soap, etc. These are the minimum epidemic prevention supplies. I hope that every family will purchase some, as they are not only necessary for hygiene but also indispensable for life.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to the promotion of counterfeit inferior goods. According to recent newspaper reports, the relabeling and dumping of inferior goods is advancing rapidly, and the situation is very dangerous. This is a very serious problem that we cannot ignore. For this reason, when purchasing summer supplies, we should pay attention to this problem. Before purchasing, we must carefully consider where to buy them to be the most appropriate, and where to buy them to be the most easily deceived. These are all problems that should be considered. I very much hope that the housewives who are in charge of purchasing goods will pay close attention to this point, so that they will not be deceived by unscrupulous merchants. At the same time, we must also know that using one more domestic product means saving one more Chinese person. This kind of merit is truly immeasurable.</p>

<h3>On Domestic Summer Supplies</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Time flies, and summer has arrived in a flash! The fashionable women on the streets are wearing foreign chiffon, crepe, etc., exposing their arms, manicuring their nails, applying rouge, and wearing foreign leather shoes on their bare feet! Parading through the streets! Passersby are watching! Thinking about the summer supplies in their homes, they must be foreign goods!</p>
<p>I recall that our domestic summer supplies are not weak either! Qiaoge gauze and Jianman crepe from the Meyer factory, etc., Goose Brand undershirts from the Wuhe Weaving Factory, electric fans from the Watson and Yapu brands, Samsung mosquito coils from the China Chemical Industry Society, bathrobes from the Sanyou Industrial Society, mao oil, stinky disinfectant, mosquito coils, Liang Dan, fly killers, and Guanshengyuan's fruit dew from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, soda and glass cups from Yili Company, Pu mats, palm fans, Huzhou goose feather fans, wire green gauze covers, rattan cars, all kinds of domestic summer supplies are available from the China National Products Company, and the Kangyuan Can Factory and the Xinyefactory produce small and exquisite insecticide sprayers! As for fruits, there are white sand loquats from Dongting Mountain, water honey peaches from Wuxi Sanle Company, flat peaches from Longhua, and Yangmei (commonly known as blood-red) from Yangjiaxi, Yushan, Xushe Town, and Xuelang Mountain in Wuxi. Clothes to wear, food to eat, truly pleasing to the eye and heart! My wife Yunqing and I felt very happy to see so many domestic goods being purchased and used! However, I deeply hope! Domestic goods should continue to improve in quality and be inexpensive and beautiful! The goal of eliminating foreign goods throughout upper, middle, and lower society can be realized! Finally, I even hope that the domestic goods industry will hold a "Domestic Summer Supplies Exhibition"!</p>
<h3>Domestic Products for Fly Control</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xingfen</p>
<p>In summer, when epidemics are rampant, we and flies are at odds. If we don't exterminate them, they will devour us.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "strike first to gain the upper hand." How can we strike first to exterminate them? This can be discussed in terms of treating the root cause and treating the symptoms. The most important thing to treat the root cause is to eliminate sewage and filth. We must know that the flies' mansions are built in filth, but this method ultimately cannot prevent them from being produced again absolutely, and there are many that have already been born, so we must use treatment.</p>
<h3>I Want to Ask You</h3>
<p>— Qian Zuizhu</p>
<p>[Psychological Test of the National Products Year]</p>
<p>(1) Do you feel that the meaning of the National Products Year is significant?</p>
<p>(2) How many goods have you purchased this year, and what proportion are foreign goods?</p>
<p>(3) Have you ever thought about what kind of effect every penny flowing into the pockets of foreigners will have?</p>
<p>(4) If your lover wants to use expensive imported hair, will you maintain your love?</p>
<p>(5) If your child wants to eat foreign candy, will you follow his heart?</p>
<p>(6) Have you ever thought that it doesn't matter whether individuals use domestic goods or not?</p>
<p>(7) When cheap foreign goods and domestic goods are displayed at the same time, which one will you choose?</p>
<p>(8) Have you ever found that even the most crude domestic goods have their advantages? (Money in the hands of the Chinese is equal to money not spent)</p>
<p>(9) Have you ever felt that even the most beautiful foreign goods have their disadvantages? (Money goes out and doesn't come back, even if it's cheap, it's expensive)</p>
<p>(10) When you need a certain product and there is no domestic alternative, do you buy it openly or endure without using it?</p>
<p>(11) Do you think using high-end foreign goods is very respectable?</p>
<p>(12) Have you calculated how much money you give to foreigners every year?</p>
<p>(13) Have you led your family by example to purchase and use domestic goods consistently?</p>
<p>(14) Do you feel disgusted by the constant nagging about the "National Products Year"? Finally, I want to ask you, who is to blame for our life environment being so depressing? What is it that makes us so poor?</p>
<p>Please think about it and then answer, or you will feel the greatness and urgency of the meaning of the National Products Year.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>As for symptoms, there are many ways. I will briefly describe some of them below: Spray stinky disinfectant everywhere. Flies like the smell, but they are very afraid of the smell of stinky disinfectant; the Double Knife brand is the best stinky disinfectant, and it is also very cheap.</p>
<p>Kill them with a fly swatter. This method is more economical and durable than using glass fly traps. It is also very convenient for us to make it ourselves. Buy some green gauze, cut it into a rectangular shape, fold the four sides slightly, and clip it with a long bamboo strip. If you want it to be more durable, you can sew a green cloth strip around the green gauze, because the structure of the fly's eyes cannot see green.</p>
<h3>Domestic Short Clothing - Improved Long Gown</h3>
<p>— Southern Beauty</p>
<p>Clothes cover the body, and there are various differences in quality and form. Customs and habits are different, and likes and dislikes are different. Monks wear their robes, Taoists wear their headscarves, laborers wear short clothes, soldiers wear military uniforms, ladies wear cheongsams, and literati wear long gowns. Each has its own history and its own freedom. There is no need to force them, and there is no need to change them.</p>
<p>Why do I say this? "Things are unequal, such is the nature of things." Belonging to the same human race, there are differences in skin color, differences in the length and curl of hair, differences in the height of the nose, and differences in the fingerprints of hands and feet. It can be seen that God has given humanity in order not to make it all the same. The body and hair are still like this; how much more so for clothes that cover the body!</p>
<p>Speaking of the origin of wearing clothes, is it ultimately to cover up shame? To protect body temperature? Or to decorate and beautify? The mountain tribes in the tropics still only take a banana leaf to cover their lower bodies, and some use silver pieces and pearls as covers, as if to show the location of their important organs. This is certainly to cover up shame. Residents in the cold zones, needless to say, wear heavy furs to protect their body temperature. What about people in the temperate zone? The heat in summer sometimes far exceeds the equator (for example, this year the indoor temperature in Chicago has reached one hundred and twelve degrees, which is rare on the equator). However, the practice of nudity can never invade the "national gates" of etiquette. (The practice of nudity began in Hong Kong's Fragrant Powder Bungalow, and the Guangzhou authorities ordered a strict ban to prevent it in advance.) This cannot but be said to be a manifestation of the tradition that "everyone has a sense of shame and disgust." It also proves that a large part of our wearing clothes is still for the sake of beauty.</p>
<p>Now, I want to go on to discuss the "long gown" problem, which the author believes is "extremely important" and is common among the literati of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>According to what I have heard people say, the advantages of the long gown are that the skirt hangs below the knees, covering the crotch, so that the crotch of the legs is not exposed, and it can fully express a refined and gentle atmosphere. One is that the light skirt flutters and moves with the wind, giving people a sense of detachment from the world. In addition to these two points of view, one of etiquette and one of art, I can't think of any reasons worth defending.</p>
<p>I must first declare that I will never encourage people to wear Western suits. The restriction of the collar and tie on the neck, depriving a part of the freedom of looking up and down, is also something I cannot understand. In this way, I can freely discuss "the crimes of the long gown" without having to "pull out my hair," but it doesn't hurt to "count on my fingers": the two skirts of the long gown waste useful clothing material and violate the principle of economy, this is the first disadvantage; it hinders the advancement of the legs when walking (although the resistance is slight, it cannot be said to be equal to zero), this is the second disadvantage; walking against the wind, the back is like a flag; walking forward with the wind, the abdomen is like a stone drum, this is the third disadvantage; going up and down stairs, you must lift the skirt carefully, always fearing a fall, this is the fourth disadvantage; work is inconvenient, and the habit of being a good-for-nothing is formed, this is the fifth disadvantage; when visiting a machine factory, if you are not careful, the belt will clamp it and fly, and you will be crushed to pieces, and it will be too late to regret, this is the sixth disadvantage; riding a bicycle, you must scoop up and catch it back and forth, adding trouble in vain, this is the seventh disadvantage; the sleeves droop and cover the pulse, wiping the table, erasing</p>
<p>the blackboard, dipping in vegetable soup, collecting dirt, standing with drooping sleeves, the servile air of softness and obedience is full, this is the eighth disadvantage.</p>
<p>In summary, the "long gown" is a "backward clothing" of the twentieth century and a "parasite" in the New Life Movement, without any doubt. However, now seven or eight out of ten teachers and students in schools across the country, old clerks in stores, and civil servants in the political world are still long gown comrades. The accumulation of habits is deep, and reform is not easy.</p>
<p>Some say that advocating domestic goods should respect national clothing. Opposing long gowns is tantamount to cutting off the way out for domestic goods. But readers should not doubt that I have always admired the long gown for its lightness and comfort, unlike the trouble of Western suits, and for taking refreshment instead of being upright. The two slogans I want to put forward for "improving the long gown" are:</p>
<p>"The hem should not be longer than the knees,"</p>
<p>"The sleeve should not extend beyond the wrist."</p>
<p>In this way, it does not harm the appearance, but it benefits the actual; it is comfortable to sit and stand, and it is convenient to work. Using domestic materials and saving waste: it has the convenience of a Western suit without feeling burdensome. Why hesitate not to do it! Some people say, I'm afraid it won't look good like this! Then I will tell you to "try it!"</p>
<h3>Starting with Straw Hats</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Pavilion Master</p>
<p>During this summer season, the scorching sun is high, and all friends who have to run around on the road need straw hats to shade themselves from the fierce sunlight.</p>
<p>A few years ago, most straw hats were hard-brimmed and flat-topped. Although many people still wear them today, they are not as popular as soft-brimmed, copper-basin-style hats.</p>
<p>In the past, most straw hats were "imported goods." Now, there are also many domestic straw hats. Not only are the goods excellent and the styles beautiful, but they are also comparable to "imported goods." Moreover, the selling price is also lower than that of "imported goods."</p>
<p>However, I heard that now there are some hat merchants who have conceived a strange idea: they put the brand of a certain British hat factory on these "cheap and beautiful" domestic straw hats in order to pretend to be "British imported goods" for sale! It is said that in this way, they can raise the price to cater to the psychology of ordinary "foreign fanatics."</p>
<p>Alas! If this is true, I feel that since we already have very good "domestic goods" such as Huafu straw hats, why bother to put them in the brand of foreign factories in order to pretend to be "imported goods"? You must know that "foreign goods pretending to be domestic goods" is unforgivable. And "domestic goods pretending to be foreign goods" is infinitely harmful! Because domestic goods are covered with the brand of foreign factories, even if the domestic goods are excellent, the Chinese people cannot identify them, which greatly hinders the development of the future of domestic goods! I hope that domestic goods factories will pay special attention to this point - "domestic goods pretending to be foreign goods" - and correct it if they have it, and encourage themselves if they don't.</p>
<h3>Adopting Summer Supplies Song</h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival has passed,</p>
<p>The terrible summer is coming,</p>
<p>People feel the changes in life.</p>
<p>Regarding the addition of this summer's supplies,</p>
<p>I feel urgent and necessary.</p>
<p>Here, we must recognize the goal. Being fond of foreign goods is no longer what people of blood do,</p>
<p>Advocating domestic production is exactly what our own duties entail,</p>
<p>A tacit recognition known to every household,</p>
<p>An existence that is as natural as the laws of heaven,</p>
<p>All purchases,</p>
<p>Of course, go to domestic goods companies and shopping malls to find them.</p>
<p>"Clean, beautiful, and durable,"</p>
<p>This is the principle we had before purchasing,</p>
<p>And only exquisite domestic goods can achieve this.</p>
<p>If you can concentrate all your consumption here,</p>
<p>You will be satisfied with your entire summer.</p>
<p>Family Visit Report</p>
<h3>Miss Liu Wang Liming</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiacheng</p>
<p>On one hand, she is enthusiastic about social endeavors, and on the other, she does not give up managing the household. She is able to balance the welfare of women and the happiness of her husband and children. Miss Liu Wang Liming, wife of Liu Zhanen, can be said to be a model of modern women. She is a devout Christian, and Great Harmony (Datong) is her ideal. However, she believes that Great Harmony can only be achieved after self-improvement. At the same time, they advocate for equal rights for men and women, consistently maintaining that true equality can only be achieved after women become independent. They do not reject having children; rather, for the sake of motherhood and the future of children, they advocate for moderation, focusing on qualitative development to prevent mass production. Further, the steps taken by the Women's Temperance Union extend to "lifestyle moderation." Therefore, in conversation, Miss Liu Wang Liming unconsciously advocates: "Our lives should be simple!" This is related to the National Products Movement. Thrift eliminates extravagance, and the automatic avoidance of imported goods contributes to the movement. Because the general public values affordable prices and quality in national products, in addition to temporary emotional support, she hopes that the business community will work hard in this regard. During the conversation, she also gave an example, saying that cloth costing one yuan and five jiao per five zhang (a unit of length) fades when washed, which indirectly hinders the prospects of national products.</p>
<p>"We not only advocate for national products, but we also practice what we preach!"</p>
<p>She proved that the clothing of several ladies working at the Women's Voice Society, such as Miss Yang Meizhen, were all national products.</p>
<p>The conversation turned to the Women's Orphanage (their endeavor) and the recent children's clothing exhibition, which featured children's clothes entirely made from national products. For boys, there were everyday clothes, naval uniforms, and casual wear; for girls, there were violet, red rose, and other styles. Efforts were made in tailoring, and when the eight children performed in them, the beauty was no less than that of imported products. She also showed some remaining sets as proof. It is said that the significance of this exhibition is:</p>
<p>"To dispel the common misconception that national products are only suitable for coarse cloth robes."</p>
<p>Casually mentioning her impressions of traveling to Japan, she also spoke about a serious issue:</p>
<p>"Currently, what are truly national products, and what are fake national products? I remember hearing people in Japan say that after Japanese goods are made, they often falsely use the name of Chinese national products, sometimes even adding a warning: 'Heaven will punish those who don't use national products!' (This may be a joke.) Therefore, we cannot help but earnestly hope that the business community will act with conscience to maintain the future of genuine national products!"</p>
<p>Because some people doubt the significance of the National Products Movement (of course, these are a minority of extremists), I asked Miss Wang Liming for some insights from an academic perspective.</p>
<p>"A person who relies on others can never be equal to those on whom they rely, and the same is true for countries and nations. I feel that advocating for national products is a principle of achieving equality and self-reliance. However, the ultimate goal is to achieve equality and Great Harmony!"</p>
<p>When discussing the issue of church school students favoring imported goods, she admitted that church students tend to be more inclined towards material enjoyment due to their economic status. However, based on the recent situation at both the Shanghai and Hujiang schools, she optimistically stated that the trend has changed. It is said that most of the Hujiang female students' clothing is made from national product materials. Furthermore, she advocates for strict training for middle school students, instilling in them the habit of using national products and wearing uniforms, so that they can develop a trend when they go to university.</p>
<p>Regarding the work of the Women's National Products Year, she advocates that the women's community should take the initiative to do it. As for the rural National Products Movement, in addition to youth students from rural areas being responsible for helping, we can also add regulations promoting national products in the government's rural revitalization plan. However, she feels that increasing purchasing power is even more important in rural areas than in cities.</p>
<p>Finally, upon saying goodbye, she gave me a copy of the Women's Voice "Women and National Products Special Issue," the title of the first article being:</p>
<p>"The Women's Army Mobilizes!"</p>
<h3>National Product Mosquito Coils</h3>
<p>— Guohui</p>
<p>Summer is here! Countless mosquitoes, armed with sharp, poisonous mouths, are everywhere spreading malaria. If we want to eliminate these evil mosquitoes, we must first use thorough methods.</p>
<p>Many people, in order to kill annoying mosquitoes, buy inferior mosquito coils or mosquito coils made of inferior materials. Although they may get peace at night, they are planting the seeds of suicide for the future! Because everyone knows that inferior goods are a form of aggression. Enemies take our money in exchange for inferior goods and then use our money to make weapons to kill us.</p>
<p>Therefore, while mosquitoes can certainly be killed, inferior goods should not be used. If you want to eliminate the disturbance of mosquitoes, you can buy and use national products, such as the "Globe Brand Mosquito Coils" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, which are made entirely from national product raw materials, and all their effects are superior to inferior goods.</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Summer Supplies</h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>Summer, a sultry and oppressive summer, a summer when epidemics are rampant, how uncomfortable it is! Humans are ultimately intelligent, and humans can certainly conquer nature. Thus, there are inventions such as fans, straw mats, mosquito coils, insecticide powder, soda water...</p>
<p>Although they cannot completely eliminate the scorching heat and diseases, they do make people feel more comfortable and at ease in their lives. Moreover, these goods are well-fortified, and their lines of defense are solid, preventing foreign goods from invading. This is worthy of praise and admiration! Now, I am composing a few "neither songs nor ballads, seemingly new yet old" pieces below, to express my due respect.</p>
<p>(1) Fan</p>
<p>Oh, fan! Oh, fan! You fan away the rain-like beads of sweat; you fan in the refreshing breeze that chills the bones. However, you must not fan away the boiling hot blood in my heart, or else people will ridicule me for being a "five-minute wonder, starting but never finishing."</p>
<p>(2) Straw Mat</p>
<p>As the evening comes, the scorching heat subsides, and the spirit is weary and the eyes are dazed. Woven from grass, the mat induces people to enter the land of sleep. I advise you not to dream of butterflies; I advise you not to dream of wealth. In ancient times, people slept on firewood; today, people sleep on mats. The firewood pricks, but the mat brings coolness. The pricks can extinguish hatred; do not greedily sleep soundly, allowing great bandits to run rampant.</p>
<p>(3) Mosquito Coil</p>
<p>Hey, you little demons, shaped like snakes, attacking people when they are unprepared, bragging and boasting.</p>
<p>Sucking fat and drinking blood, what are you! Greed leads to destruction, a lesson for all time.</p>
<p>The sharp weapon for killing enemies is called the mosquito coil. A wisp of clear smoke, wings broken and body stiff.</p>
<p>The scent is fragrant and the smell is light, lingering in the air. Millions of sharp swords, warding off epidemics and killing insects.</p>
<p>(4) Insecticide Powder</p>
<p>You are probably also inheriting the mantle of "imperialists"! Flies are using political aggression; bedbugs are using military aggression; and many unknown insects are also waving flags and cheering in support. Good! Press the long, cylindrical machine gun; spray the fine mist-like bullets, kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill those invading people until they lower their flags, silence their drums, and are utterly defeated.</p>
<p>(5) Soda Water</p>
<p>Your body is ice-cold; your ambition is soaring; soaring straight up three thousand zhang, to extinguish the scorching heat, to wound the blazing sun. It's just that people gulp you down like cattle drinking, whales swallowing, and you are letting down your cool, kind heart.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Dahai Hair Clipper Factory</h3>
<p>— Zigen</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Shen, is a man with a purpose. Seeing that enemy-made hair clippers are being dumped in large quantities, causing countless amounts of money to flow out of the country every year, and that there are no excellent national products to replace them, he felt that simply advocating national products was not practical. Therefore, in the autumn of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), he raised 100,000 yuan and founded the Great Shanghai Hair Clipper Factory on Longhua Road in Shanghai. Since its establishment, the products have become increasingly refined, and sales have increased year by year. Yesterday, in response to Mr. Shen's invitation, I went to visit the factory. The factory covers an area of more than ten mu, and is divided into sawing, plier, lathe, planer, drilling, sand casting, nickel plating, assembly, and promotion departments. The engineer, Mr. He Baisheng, provided a detailed explanation. I deeply felt that the layout was well-organized and orderly, rarely seen in national product factories. The work in each department was quite intense, so Mr. He had to personally guide and supervise. The produced hair clippers are lighter and more durable than imported products, so many barbershops in this city are happy to purchase them. According to Mr. Shen, since the beginning of the Republic of China, all Chinese people have been cutting their hair. The old-fashioned Chinese razors are no longer applicable, and imported hair clippers have taken the opportunity to enter the market, especially enemy-made ones, causing profits to flow out of the country, which cannot be recovered. During the January 28th Incident (Shanghai), our compatriots were brutally killed, which was shocking and heart-wrenching. Therefore, he decided to found this factory to specifically resist enemy-made goods. The trademark takes the three characters "January 28th" to show that he will not forget the national humiliation.</p>
<h3>National Product News of the Week</h3>
<p>(1) At the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's general meeting of members, the executive committee proposed that the paper, copper-iron, and machinery trade associations be commended for their ability to supervise their respective industries, strictly enforce agreements, uphold righteousness, and not shirk hard work, especially for their sincere efforts in promoting national products.</p>
<p>(2) The National Railway Line Product Review Committee held a meeting in Beiping on the 15th and decided on six review standards: 1. those related to railway transportation; 2. those related to promoting national products; 3. those related to national defense; 4. those related to improving agriculture, industry, and commerce; 5. those related to national product consumer goods; 6. those whose special national product industries need encouragement in their production. As for the classification of exhibits, it was decided to divide them into seven groups: agricultural products, mineral products, medicinal materials, aquatic products, handicrafts, poultry, and livestock. The review committee members for each group in each hall have also been assigned, and the review time has been agreed upon from the 17th to the 25th. After the review is completed, the association will issue certificates to encourage them.</p>
<p>(3) In order to revitalize foreign trade, rubber merchants from various regions specifically requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt rubber export taxes and increase rubber import taxes. In order to rescue this product, the Ministry agreed to exempt all rubber produced in Qiongyai from export and domestic transit taxes.</p>
<p>(4) The Silk Improvement Association decided to establish 100 autumn silkworm demonstration centers in Zhejiang Province to promote and improve silkworm breeding. In the future, it will surely have a significant effect on domestic silk.</p>
<p>(5) Liu Yin Fu, a staff member of the Ministry of Industry, recently came to Shanghai to investigate the cotton yarn industry and drafted five measures to implement relief, which were submitted to the Ministry for adoption. The measures are: 1. increase cotton yarn import tariffs; 2. reduce yarn and cotton freight rates; 3. ban the adulteration of impure cotton; 4. prevent labor strikes to avoid hindering factory operations; 5. standardize cotton yarn market prices to stabilize the market. After considering the above points, the Ministry of Industry now believes that there are mutual relationships with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways. After the three parties have the same opinions, a relief conference will be convened, at which time yarn manufacturers in this city will also be invited to attend the discussion.</p>
<p>(6) The Shanghai Penglai Market National Product Exhibition has been open for two weeks. It was originally scheduled to close on the 21st. Now, because the results of this exhibition are excellent, various manufacturers have requested a postponement. It has been unanimously agreed to extend the exhibition until the end of this month.</p>

<h3>On Lychees</h3>
<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>The lychees transported from the South China Sea are mostly unripe. When they arrive in Shanghai, their color, fragrance, and taste are all inferior. If someone had the literary talent of Old Man Xiangqi, they could imitate the "Ode to Hami Melon" and write an "Ode to Lychees," which might offer a humorous spectacle. But that would only be interesting if Old Man Xiangqi wrote it.</p>
<p>The mountain spring water is clear. Once out of the spring, the water becomes muddy. In the mountains, it is Polygala, but out of the mountains, it is a small weed. The atmosphere makes it so, the environment makes it so. Especially things that are time-sensitive or have local characteristics, once they leave their origin, undergo great changes. Hami melons are not the same when they arrive in Beiping.</p>
<p>Many things have been introduced to China in the past decade or so: politics, economics, literature, art, canned beef, cream bread, but they mostly change and lose their inherent spiritual form. But like Taijiquan or landscape paintings, there are also things that have been transmitted abroad, which must be quite alien.丨 The magical turns into the decadent, and the decadent turns into the magical. In the end, it is a matter of time and place.</p>
<p>Although the environment has an impact, a large part of it still depends on the quality of the thing itself and the person using it. Pine and cypress grow lush and clear, and the osmanthus is old and fragrant. Xi Shi is beautiful, but she is even more beautiful when she clutches her heart; if Dongs Shi is not beautiful, she will be even uglier when she imitates Xi Shi. If you want to blaze a new trail, innovate, and transform the decadent into the magical, it takes great effort, which writers and artists occasionally achieve. Because they self-edit and know the roots, they adapt to the situation and do not always treat the decadent as magical. For example, the Empty Fort Strategy can only be used once.</p>
<p>However, great figures introduce political theories, and small figures peddle literature and art, often turning the magnificent elephant into a small mouse, and mistaking the aphid for a giant ox. One can say that they are still animals, but if one draws a tiger and it looks like a winter melon, there is nothing one can do. However, one can still say, as long as one knows oneself. The most incurable is to deliberately treat the foul and decadent as magical, pretending to be a critic or a revolutionary leader. If sand is clearly said to be sand, it is not hateful, but if one insists that it is carborundum from Oxford University, it is difficult to know if they are truly foolish or crazy. Even if one seals it tightly and displays it seductively, it is still too far apart.</p>
<p>Even when lychees are dried, they are still lychees, and even before they are fresh, they do not lose their goodness. Many things from the West are simply dried dung.</p>
<h3>From the Struggle Between Classical and Vernacular Chinese to the Struggle Between Life and Death</h3>
<p>— Lebing</p>
<p>If you are willing to use a dialectical mindset to write a history of Chinese writing, many people will tell you:</p>
<p>"The life-and-death struggle of written language has been going on for more than two thousand years. The written language necessary for the daily life of the general public is based on the words commonly spoken by living people. The books that people automatically spend money to buy and read, by the thousands and tens of thousands, are also more popular the closer they are to living language. Living people pretending to be ghosts will not succeed. Using semi-dead classical Chinese to create articles and print them into collections has no connection with the actual society."</p>
<p>Ancient people used Li Bai as an example. His poems could be used as money in the general society;</p>
<p>His essays were worthless. Modern people use Wang Maozu, the initiator of the recent classical Chinese movement, as an example. He wrote two articles in classical Chinese in support of classical Chinese. However, if Saint Tao were to take his great articles and send them to a literary hospital for dissection, I don't know how many people's stomachs would ache from laughter.</p>
<p>The resurgence of the classical Chinese movement, although said to be only a partial manifestation of a certain kind of revivalist consciousness, also has its roots in the considerable mistakes of the writers who were responsible to society in the past. The so-called "vernacular" of the vernacular movement promoted thirty or forty years ago, where "bai" meant "Daobai" (plainly spoken) and "hua" meant "lively language," was similar to the Cantonese term "Baihua." After the May Fourth Movement, some people distorted it to mean "easy to understand." Hu Shi's "History of Vernacular Literature" stuffed all the semi-dead classical Chinese from history into it, and the line between lively language and ghost language became blurred. Simply changing "Yan Zhe Hu Ye" to "Le De Ma Ya" made a whole article of ghost language count as vernacular. Furthermore, the so-called May Fourth children, XX, etc., and the so-called national language experts, XXXX, etc., openly started writing classical Chinese, and the person who tied the bell untied it themselves. How can you blame those below?</p>
<p>Language and writing are both symbols of people's social consciousness. Social consciousness is constantly changing, and language naturally changes along with it. When writing differs from language, that writing cannot accurately express the social consciousness of the time. Therefore, the ancient writing full of feudal consciousness certainly has no possibility of revival; similarly, vernacular that is just "easy to understand," classical language, and recorded speech should also be swept away.</p>
<p>We should correct the mistakes of the struggle between classical and vernacular Chinese and actively launch a life-and-death struggle. In addition to continuing to prevent the resurgence of classical Chinese, for the sake of the public's interests, there should also be considerable decisions and efforts regarding all issues when using lively language to write lively writing:丨</p>
<p>First, affirm that language and writing have the same origin, that language and writing cannot be separated, that language develops forward with the development of social consciousness, and that writing should also change with language at any time; similarly, the statement that Mr. Chen Zizhan recently made that a mass language literature must consider three aspects in poetry, fiction, and drama is not very appropriate. In order to respect the interests of the masses, it should be corrected to "all writing should combine language and writing."</p>
<p>Second, confirm that the Beijing dialect with the greatest universality is the basis for modern lively language, and is the main component of mass language literature. Third, acknowledge that "writing" can reasonably and automatically absorb new components to supplement the deficiencies of language.</p>
<p>Fourth, to reduce the difficulty of writing for the masses: (A) writing down what is said counts as writing, (B) promote simplified characters and tolerate typos.</p>
<h3>The Future of Classical Chinese</h3>
<p>— Lengmo</p>
<p>Recently, someone protested to the promoters of classical Chinese because students who study classical Chinese end up being incomprehensible. I assert that this protest is ineffective! The promoters originally did not want writing丨 especially writing that can express one's own meaning. They merely used emphasizing classical Chinese as a means to force people to read ancient books. If the vernacular had only gone as far as what Hu Shi advocated, writing the vernacular while still not forgetting that bundle of useless minimum national studies book list, classical Chinese might not have risen again. However, the vernacular had an effect that Hu Shi did not expect. The vernacular not only changed the form of writing but also changed the content of writing. This content did not have to have any relationship with ancient books, so that minimum book list was completely thrown to the lowest level.</p>
<p>The people who opposed the vernacular in the May Fourth era and the people who promote classical Chinese today are not the same. The former would never allow the vernacular, while the latter can certainly allow people to write vernacular that is in the style of the Four Books and Five Classics. It is only because it is impossible for those who want to write the vernacular to write articles in the style of the Four Books and Five Classics that they still only promote classical Chinese. They also know that it is impossible to revive classical Chinese, but they think that at least they can force people to read a little bit of ancient books.</p>
<p>The era of directly promoting reading the classics is no longer here!</p>
<p>Famous European and American political cartoons (reproduced from Shenbao Monthly)</p>
<p>It cannot come again, which allows us to not have to be too pessimistic. How much effect can direct methods have is really a question. Conflicting opinions, no matter how well-read, cannot occupy a corner of the brain. No one is willing to melt the classics to create writing anymore.</p>
<p>The reason that students' classical Chinese is incomprehensible is not just that the writing is not good; a bigger reason is that they have nothing to say. I have seen some essay topics that are fundamentally designed to be written in incomprehensible classical Chinese. In fact, we already have many brilliant examples.</p>
<p>Those brilliant articles, in fact, no longer receive the same level of importance as ancient texts, so in addition to brilliant articles, they still have to rely on the vernacular as an aid. This proves that it is no longer possible to directly have people seek the ancient way through ancient writing. One day, indirect promotion will fail, and another indirect method will have to be added, translating ancient books into the vernacular.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is really no need to worry about the vernacular now. They will eventually become smarter and use the vernacular. As for whether there is anything else to worry about after the vernacular is used, it is not necessarily so. The vernacular’s Daughters Classic is not as incapable of maintaining its influence as the classic language’s Daughters Classic.</p>

<h3>Thoughts After Watching a Performance by the Business School (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Baiwei</p>
<p>On the evening of June 16, the Business School performed two plays at the Lake Society: one was Kikuchi Kan's "Father Returns," which has been performed the most in Shanghai; the other was the French play "Reigniting a Ruined Hearth" (translated by Li Liewen).</p>
<p>I didn't see "Father Returns"; I only saw "Reigniting a Ruined Hearth." This play was performed for the first time in Shanghai, so it naturally gave the audience a new feeling, and also grasped the audience's tense and calm hearts, right?</p>
<p>The structure and dialogue of the script, in the eyes of people like us who do not have much dramatic cultivation, are too skillful. That rigorous and precise organization, the deeply compelling mood that becomes more profound with each layer, truly makes the audience have to hold their breath to appreciate it. It especially gives those young men and women with strong romantic interests enough to chew on, and it gives those couples who live together a bell-and-drum-like stimulus. It explains the cruelty of war and vividly depicts the storm of doubt and jealousy. Besides these, what other thoughts does it give us?</p>
<p>Like women in recent years keeping long hair, curled and draped over their shoulders; like women wearing long cheongsams, gracefully dragging on the ground; like women wearing four-inch high heels, rhythmically clicking out the beat; I feel that this play has the same leisurely and exquisite charm, appearing before my eyes.</p>
<p>These postures are elegant, refined, and beautiful. At the same time, they are also wasteful, regressive, the cutting edge of capitalism, and clearly show a decadent and reactionary tendency.</p>
<p>Isn't it? The playwright uses extremely abundant energy and embossed writing to present an ordinary and sickly romantic history. He makes the male protagonist's vision so narrow that he only sees love and does not see everything that is more important than love, resulting in such a helpless tragedy, and says that all this is caused by war. It is true that "war makes many people's wives widowed and destroys many happy families!" The playwright has done this very well, cursing the war to the bone. However, what else did the war give the playwright to recognize? If what the playwright recognized is exactly the same as what is presented in this play, then the capitalist war is too meaningless!</p>
<p>When the European War broke out, Andre, a middle school teacher, was driven to the front line to be cannon fodder, fully tasted the life of the battlefield, the life of a prisoner of war, and experienced all the tragic and cruel things. He spent four years like this until he was released home after the armistice.</p>
<p>What did four years of war experience give him to recognize? It seems that besides knowing how to suffer, he only knows how to suspect that his beloved wife and the American officer living in his home have immoral behavior, and only knows how to be jealous that his beloved wife and that American officer have fallen in love. In addition, he recognized nothing.</p>
<p>Isn't it? That war gave the entire European society and mankind the entire tragedy. The war was only for the ambition of capitalism, the war was only for the interests, status, and domination of a few noble people, and drove countless dominated people to sacrifice, suffer, die, and destroy the happiness of countless people. He did not recognize these things, nor did he want to recognize them. Even what his old father said: "I sometimes feel that the grieving Lorraine misses you too much... When others come to see her, she doesn't even know what to say. 'If Andre was at home, if Andre was by my side...' Besides these words..." He had no intention of understanding his beloved wife's bitter thoughts about him, and he was not moved.</p>
<h3>Hand History</h3>
<p>— Xu Jiong</p>
<p>The world was originally plain,</p>
<p>And every healthy hand did the same work;</p>
<p>Slowly, the world became troublesome,</p>
<p>And people's hands began to have different labors.</p>
<p>Some hands plow the fields, some hands sew clothes,</p>
<p>Some hands row boats, some hands steer,</p>
<p>Some hands control the rake, some hands control the plow,</p>
<p>Some hands gather, some hands build the fire.</p>
<p>Slowly, the world began to differentiate,</p>
<p>Workers worked, officials managed affairs,</p>
<p>And so, some hands were pampered,</p>
<p>But there was still subtle hardship.</p>
<p>But now, the world is becoming ever more strange,</p>
<p>Many people's hands only know how to embrace colorful bodies.</p>
<h3>Guiying's Father (6)</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>"As Xiaoyu grew up day by day, even the former big gentry Zhuang Siye and Lord Na came to our village. They actually bowed to me and called me 'Old Master.' They were even more polite to Xiaoyu. Xiaoyu told me that they were local bullies and bad gentry, who usually oppressed the common people, and now the Party Headquarters wanted to deal with them, so they were pleading with Xiaoyu. Xiaoyu wanted them to donate a large sum of money to the Poor Relief Bureau, but they refused. In the end, they fled with their families.</p>
<p>"During this time, Xiaoyu would preach some principles to us every day. This child usually didn't talk much, but now, once he started, he couldn't stop. Guiying was talkative to begin with, and now that she was following her older brother, she was even more unstoppable. I couldn't completely understand what they were saying. I just believed that people should be equal, and there shouldn't be a distinction between rich and poor, that was true. But my old wife didn't believe these words. She said that poverty and wealth were predetermined by fate, those destined to be poor would always be poor, and those destined to be rich would always be rich. She said that Xiaoyu was now bigger than the magistrate, which was also fate. She wanted Xiaoyu to make her clothes out of patterned satin and buy her a big house. When Xiaoyu didn't answer, she got angry. She scolded Xiaoyu and his sister for being heartless, saying that now that they were successful, they didn't even care about the family. What was the use of being rich and powerful then! Who had ever seen the family of an official looking like this, it's unlucky! Xiaoyu said that he wasn't an official, he was a revolutionary helping the poor, how could he take the poor people's money to enjoy himself? But the old wife never believed it. She said, who are you trying to fool? Aren't you a Standing Committee member? Aren't you the director of the Drug Bureau? Isn't that being an official? If you're not an official, why did the magistrate ask you to seal it! Helping the poor, helping the poor, the poor are all cheap bones, what's the point of helping them? You're either lying to yourself, or you're intentionally deceiving me.</p>
<p>On one hand, I thought my old wife didn't understand things, but on the other hand, I also thought that Xiaoyu was a bit strange. At that time, most of the other committee members in the Party Headquarters were decorating their homes more beautifully than before, and the clothes they wore were getting better and better every day. They were obviously making a lot of money, but only Xiaoyu didn't. But I didn't blame him, because Xiaoyu had always been a good child, and I believed that his actions were always right. Moreover, at that time, our family was actually richer than before, Xiaoyu became the Director of the Education Bureau - the old wife didn't understand, saying he was the director of the Drug Bureau, haha. Guiying also became the principal of a girls' school, and their salaries were much higher than before. My family could be considered to have good luck.</p>
<p>Good luck came too quickly, so it also left very quickly. My Xiaoyu was a Standing Committee member for less than three months, and the situation changed again. A new group of people came from the province, and the people in the county were also completely replaced. The position of Standing Committee member fell into the hands of the rogue Zhuang Laowu, and my Xiaoyu didn't have a share. After a while, he couldn't be the Director of the Education Bureau anymore, because the magistrate had also been replaced. From then on, a group of gentry rose to power again, also claiming to be revolutionaries, and opposed Xiaoyu and his people. Many of Xiaoyu's friends fled to Shanghai. But Xiaoyu didn't flee. He went to Xixiang once and didn't come home for a long time. I didn't know what he went there to do. I waited at the city gate, and whenever people from Xixiang entered the city, I would ask about Xiaoyu's news. Some people told me: Your Mr. Xiaoyu is really a good person, he looks up to us poor people, he said he would help us and oppose the wealthy people's demand to reduce grain tax. After half a month, one day suddenly seven or eight hundred people from Xixiang entered the city, surrounded Zhuang Laowu's county Party Headquarters, demanding that the Party Headquarters continue to run the Poor Relief Bureau and deal with the local bullies and bad gentry. They also went to the home of the big wealthy man Zhuang Siye,</p>
<p>forcing Zhuang Siye to agree to reduce rent. They made a scene for most of the day before leaving the city. When they saw me at the city gate, they all nodded to me. Some told me that Xiaoyu had taught them to do this."</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Diagnosis of the Nation</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>It seems everyone is shouting: We are an excellent nation, Chinese people are a great people. Yes, I also quite agree; I can absolutely guarantee that I do not despise any compatriots, I will not change to the nationality of another race, let alone want to be a slave of a subjugated country. I am a descendant of civilized China, and also the glorious Han people, I will always be proud of this, confident in this. However, I have a certain understanding of my compatriots, and because of this understanding, I feel that our compatriots, our nation, are indeed facing a major crisis. What is the crisis? It is "the defects and aging of the nation," because the defects and aging of the nation make every compatriot seem to be regressing. This regression has reached the most dangerous period today. Generally speaking, mankind should be progressive and developing, but our nation is regressive and aging, this is an undeniable hidden worry.</p>
<p>According to my observation, our nation has the following kinds of defects. This is just a general statement, but in fact, if analyzed in detail, there are more than just these. It's simply full of holes and sores, unable to find a piece of clean flesh. This is by no means my harshness, but a fact as reliable as steel.</p>
<p>Now let me list a few roughly:</p>
<p>The first is extreme inertia. When I first came to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area, I saw teahouses everywhere, and the teahouses were full of customers. I was very surprised and felt that this was a sign of prosperous people's livelihood. But this is not the case, but rather a full expression of a kind of national inertia, because I observed that most of the compatriots sitting in the teahouse are not well-off people, but rather some coolies and vagrants. Furthermore, who among our compatriots doesn't love to cross their legs and crack melon seeds, not caring about serious matters all day long, which is enough to prove the growth and prevalence of inertia. In Shanghai, compatriots are even more particularly lazy, only separated by one stop, too lazy to move their feet and walk, they must take a six-cent tram to feel at ease. If I think about the trouble of getting on and off the bus, it is better to walk directly, but I have seen many compatriots doing this. This is the extreme of developed inertia.</p>
<p>The second is perfunctory work, which stems from the first point. Because inertia is particularly developed, inevitably every compatriot is like a lazy snake, when doing things, as long as they can get by, they will get by. For example, building a house, originally it requires how much manpower and how much material to build it stably and well, but we can reduce it by half, and it seems very conveniently built. However, the result of this is that it cannot withstand the attack of strong winds and rain, and collapse and injure people is a common occurrence.</p>
<p>The third is optimism and acceptance of fate, which is based on the first and second points. Because the result of laziness and perfunctory work is that something is bound to go wrong. What happens when something goes wrong? They don't blame the facts, nor do they blame others, they just hold their noses and breathe out, saying that their fate is bad, and there is no way to save it, and the heavens are abusing you like this, what can be done? In this way, everything is over, and there is never any hope of turning over. Because of this, they will not examine the true facts. The facts are very harsh for our disposition. It will never forgive you because you have failed or been injured, and it will not stop the second attack. It will take advantage of the void and enter without any bottom line. How can "Heaven" and "Fate" arrange it?</p>
<p>As such, as such, our nation will naturally only decline day by day, and decline day by day. As a result, if an enemy punches me, I will endure the humiliation and pain. In fact, there is only one way to endure the humiliation and pain. Now, the slogan of revitalizing the nation seems to be shouted so loudly that it shakes the sky. I hope that those who shout will pay attention to these and fundamentally rebuild our nation once, save it from the bottomless abyss, and then there will be a way.</p>

<h3>Emotion is Not as Good as Interest</h3>
<p>— Dong Wenyuan</p>
<p>The earth is spinning, the earth is running, this era has changed, and it is becoming increasingly unlike itself. In the past, a large number of young people who ran out of schools, except for a very small number who found a way out by relying on their true abilities, but a large part of them had a way out because of private emotional relationships, but now it doesn't work. If young people only rely on private emotions to find a way out, then they will inevitably hit a wall on all sides, at most they will only hear a few nice polite words.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this era, emotion is no match for interest.</p>
<p>We look at the people in society. Apart from interests, few are willing to help our young people. It goes without saying that merchants have always valued profit, but now? It is the entire group of people in society who are like this, unless they are people who are out of favor, even men of letters are like this.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a class of graduates in a school, there are about thirty or forty people in total. Because the principal has a social standing, he starts to introduce them to jobs. As a result, unexpectedly, only two people in the class of thirty or forty people were introduced to a job. And these two people are neither the best in learning, nor the most upright in character, nor are they related to emotions. It turns out that they are driven by interests, because these two students are the least diligent, they specialize in meetings and messing around. Once, they helped the principal during a student strike. That's right, they are loyal lackeys. At that time, talking about lackeys, being used by the principal, at this time, there is a way out, and the principal gives him considerable repayment. Isn't this a relationship of interest? Young people, being a lackey is how to find a way out! From this, it can be seen that people now only want to use each other. Only when I use you, then you can use me. So-called emotions are only useful in movie theaters and restaurants, when eating and chatting. When the wine is finished and the show is over, everyone puts on an iron-faced, profit-seeking expression.</p>
<p>There is another point: we can often feel that ordinary good friends, but once they reach the stage of success, when you meet him, he will definitely put on a pompous and strange look, which is annoying to see. This is because the word "emotion" has long been forgotten.</p>
<p>Because of the various reasons mentioned above, we can know that society has changed again. In the past, it could be tightened by emotions, but now it can only be driven by interests. Perhaps only nepotism can transcend this principle.</p>
<p>In fact, we can see clearly that the reason why human relationships have become like this is entirely due to the increasingly fierce competition for survival. I hope that readers will learn some clever techniques for achieving success, in order to honor their ancestors and avoid having to ask others for advice and instead earn scolding.</p>
<p>In a word, the most important thing for young people is to cultivate academic skills, but in order to achieve quick success, they have to learn to be lackeys, be active, boast and praise themselves, so that dignitaries are dazzled and value you. This is not only a shortcut to success, but also hopeful to achieve success.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, look at those who have succeeded, who doesn't boast, who doesn't flatter, and who doesn't be a lackey? Therefore, just seek that there are lackeys to be today, why worry that there will be no success to achieve in the future. Young friends, this is a secret to success in this world. If you don't believe it, you will only be bullied by lackeys forever.</p>
<h3>Memories of Lychee Bay</h3>
<p>— Bai Fan</p>
<p>The mood of a wanderer is so desolate, and at the same time, he misses his hometown.</p>
<p>My hometown is far away in the Southern country, but I have been away from her for a year; there are so many things that still hang in the wanderer's heart. In June, the Southern country is filled with the breath of scorching heat, which is very depressing. The god of night is about to descend, and the sun is still revealing a trace of residual red, hiding in the mountains in the west, far away in the celestial realm. The cool evening breeze gently blows into my heart. At that time, I used to take a walk in the countryside, or climb Guanyin Mountain to see the entire scenery of Guangzhou. However, the streets are so arrogant, full of the smell of coal. The uneven houses, the man-eating cars, running in the crowds... I am tired of watching them, I love the river water on Lychee Bay, gently, rowing a boat, and chatting with friends.</p>
<p>One evening, I went to Bai Ying's house, with such a happy mood;</p>
<p>"Hello! You're here, I was just about to ask you to go to Daxin Company."</p>
<p>When I arrived outside her house, she came out so skippingly, wearing a white shirt and black skirt student uniform.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do at Daxin Company?"</p>
<p>"Buy something."</p>
<p>"I wanted to ask you to go to Lychee Bay."</p>
<p>She tilted her head, pouting her mouth, as if she didn't want to, I said softly to her:</p>
<p>"Such good weather, it's best for us to have fun."</p>
<p>So, she happily went with me.</p>
<p>In Lychee Bay, there are beautiful girls swimming, and pairs of men and women talking about love, it is the paradise of Guangzhou.</p>
<p>We spent two cents on the long-distance bus and arrived, hired a houseboat, rowing, rowing, away from the smelly place, passing through the red and green swimming places for young men and women. At that time, I was looking at the curves of those girls, but Bai Ying gently hit my mouth and said:</p>
<p>"You man is unreliable, what are you staring at?"</p>
<p>So, we laughed.</p>
<p>Lychee Bay is a place to talk about love, every night there are many hundreds of pairs of men and women gently swaying on the water.</p>
<p>We looked at the light green water, looked at the azure sky, looked at a few stars hanging in the silent sky. At that time, the cool breeze gently blew our youthful hearts, snuggling, tightly.</p>
<h3>Consistency in the Literary World</h3>
<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>"The literary world is not like the officialdom," I used to believe; but now I have some doubts.</p>
<p>"Obeying orders" is a self-evident creed in the officialdom. An order is issued by the superior, no matter what it is, the staff and subordinates must silently do it accordingly; and when the superior's intention changes, all previous "achievements" are overthrown, and a new stove is started, turning to a new direction, then for the subordinates, although they feel it is a pity to abandon the previous achievements, and troublesome and unreasonable to take a new path; but, apart from being a little annoyed in their hearts, they have to immediately change with it; if there is any intention to violate it, not only will their rice bowl be broken, but they are also afraid of endangering their lives. I think everyone knows these facts.</p>
<p>In the field of literature and art, although there is no such clear separation: who is the leader, who is the subordinate; and the relationship between everyone is not so tight: from top to bottom, without any disturbance; but, if a few authoritative writers are compared to superiors, a large group of small people who rely on their pens to make a living, but whose talents are not very obvious, (small people are the counterpart of authoritative writers, and do not contain any meaning of ridicule and abuse,) are compared to subordinates, then the situation is just the same; because we have seen that whenever a few authoritative writers start a change, a large group of small people who rely on their pens to make a living also follow them one after another. Although, every time at the beginning of the change, the small people also feel that this is too unreasonable, too contrary to their own opinions, and therefore they launch a heated attack and resistance against the few authoritative writers; and although the authoritative writers do not hold a command knife and force everyone to follow them, and even some of them frankly express their attitude, saying that literature and art are multi-faceted, and each should follow their own will, and take the path they have chosen; but, I don't know why, for a while, despite the use of attacking and resisting abilities on the surface, and the paths of the literary field are so divergent; the small people still want to imitate the authoritative writers in secret, and even fear that they cannot achieve the likeness.</p>
<p>A few years ago, someone advocated proletarian literature, and it was first subjected to a lot of attacks and curses, but after a short time, the whole world was full of proletarianism; last year, someone advocated humorous literature, and it was first subjected to a lot of attacks and curses, but after a short time, the whole world was full of humor; this year, someone advocated essays, and it was first subjected to a lot of attacks and curses, but, now it seems that there is a sense of essay unifying the literary world. Although the new literary movement in China has only a history of more than ten years, who can count how many different patterns have been changed in these ten years? And in each transformation, isn't it first a group attack, and then a group trend to embrace?</p>
<p>Not being instructed by the command knife, and the path of literature is so divergent and chaotic, but the large and small writers all over the world will run on the same road. Isn't this very strange and mysterious? I think this is probably because the problem of eating is playing a role in it? Because the worship of idols has become an unbreakable habit of the Chinese people, and a group of editors only follow the lead of authoritative writers: a group of unknown small people, in order to maintain the amount of royalties that earn several pieces of money per month, have to abandon their own opinions and ideas, and cater to the tastes of a group of editors and readers.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the problem of eating has not been solved, the literary world is gradually tending towards uniformity. I dare not say whether this phenomenon is good or bad, but I just feel that this situation is a bit similar to the situation in the officialdom.</p>
<h3>Reunion</h3>
<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>When I was a child, I watched village operas in my hometown. I saw the supporting actor dressed as Zhong Kui, who always did evil at first, and was tyrannical all his life, but in the end, he either suffered a violent death or was taken into prison to end his life; the supporting actor dressed as a weak scholar, who was always in poverty and frustrated everywhere at first, but in the end, he either returned home in glory or ascended to immortality; because only in this way, the script can be considered a reunion, and the reunion audience will welcome it and be satisfied.</p>
<p>This year, the "Sister Flowers" and "Orchid in the Empty Valley", which were once sensational, (re-screening) my family Wang Ma and my friend Xiao Chen have all watched them. The day before yesterday, I specially asked them which of the two plays was more moving? Their answers were consistent: Of course, "Orchid in the Empty Valley" is much better! The reason, it is said that "Orchid in the Empty Valley" is a reunion, and "Sister Flowers" is not a reunion. (Actually, it is also a reunion, editor's note)</p>
<p>Wang Shifu only wrote the Romance of the West Chamber to "Blue clouds in the sky, yellow flowers on the ground" and stopped. At that time, people thought it was not a reunion and continued to write it (according to Ma Yuming's textual research, the sequel was not written by Guan Hanqing,) although the sequel is "a dog's tail continued to a sable," but readers are very satisfied and praise it in unison; because only in this way can there be a reunion.</p>
<p>"Reunion" has become a self-evident principle in the minds of our Chinese people. A person starts painfully, and ends painfully. Perhaps everyone has personally seen these facts; but, people have descendants and future lives! Although this life ends like this, but, for the descendants, or even when they are reincarnated, who dares to say that they will not get a happy reunion one day? No one is willing to easily believe that a person who suffers and is wronged will not be rewarded!</p>
<p>The life of Chinese people is originally closely tied to this "reunion"!</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox</p>
<h3>Questioning "Agreeing to Her Request" (1)</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I read "Agreeing to Her Request" in the Amateur Mailbox of June 12th and feel that your reply is open to discussion.</p>
<p>(1) Is polygamy absolutely impossible?</p>
<p>(2) What if Mr. Wang's younger aunt cannot remarry afterwards?</p>
<p>Firstly, I believe that opposing polygamy is conditional. We should not mechanically apply or blindly believe in a legal system. It must be thoroughly examined! In feudal society, women are regarded as slaves, and in capitalist society, women are regarded as commodities. Men oppress and possess women. The realization of polygamy is driven by men, who oppress the majority of women with power and money for enjoyment or indulgence. This is a manifestation of men trampling on women. Therefore, under certain conditions, we oppose polygamy. However, all legal systems change with the development of society. If, in the future society, women achieve true liberation and men and women are truly equal, with no one oppressing anyone, and if two people are compatible in temperament, love each other, work together on their careers, and learn from each other, then "polyandry" and "polygamy" are both possible and harmless! There is no need to oppose them at all!</p>
<p>Secondly, I believe that Mr. Wang's special conditions are worth discussing:</p>
<p>(1) He is not the initiator. The initiative in this matter comes from his younger aunt. It is not that Mr. Wang seduced her, but that she admired him and made the request to him. He cannot be compared with men who seek polygamy in general.</p>
<p>(2) Pure love. Mr. Wang's younger aunt has known him for two years and only recently made this request, which shows that it is definitely not a romantic act. Mr. Wang has qualities that are worth her admiration and made the decision after long-term consideration. Mr. Wang's monthly income is only twenty yuan, and she and her sister are both shop assistants, all of whom are working class. Therefore, she cannot be equated with women who admire a man's power and money and are willing to be concubines. Mr. Wang has admirable qualities, so the growth of love is very natural. Mr. Editor, you criticized Mr. Wang for being "too careless" in the past and encouraged Mr. Wang to be "indifferent" in the future, which is very inappropriate. Who can avoid seeing relatives? Who can forbid unrequited love? I think future facts will prove whether Mr. Wang can practice indifference. I believe that if the growth of this pure love is considered valuable, it should not be hindered at all! Don't you, Mr. Editor, advocate marriage based on love? Mr. Wang and his younger aunt are in love, so why can't they have the happiness of marriage?</p>
<p>(3) Economic and sexual material conditions. Mr. Wang and both of them are working class, and the feelings between the two sisters further demonstrate great devotion. They agreed to marry together, and there will be no jealousy among them. The jealousy in a love triangle is due to the possessiveness of the bourgeoisie and the traditional slavishness and commodity nature of women! A woman who depends on a man for her life has no choice but to compete with other women for favor and livelihood! If two women both have jobs and can support themselves, and are economically independent, then there is no need to compete for a man's favor, and jealousy cannot arise. Therefore, if Mr. Wang truly marries both of them, the three of them can live together, travel together, and rest together, solving sexual desire and solving life. When there is a job, they can work together in their spare time for the advancement of society. When unemployed, they can help, comfort, and encourage each other. Isn't that a good way to live? Why should marriage be limited to two people and one of them must be removed? Therefore, I believe that the problem for Mr. Wang lies in whether his fiancée will truly agree and whether she still has the remnants of traditional jealousy and competition for favor. If she does not agree, then it is best to be indifferent to the younger aunt. From a physiological point of view, women have periods of abstinence during menstruation and pregnancy, so the relationship between one husband and two wives can also satisfy sexual desire to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Judging from the special circumstances of several conditions, Mr. Wang marrying both of them is definitely not ordinary polygamy and should not be opposed blindly. Instead, we should guide them from the actual environment to avoid a tragedy!</p>
<p>Thirdly, if Mr. Wang follows your guidance, Mr. Editor, the future of the younger aunt will be a real problem. It goes without saying that the elimination of passion after heartbreak often leads to suicide or spinsterhood. It may be difficult to introduce her to a boyfriend and change her love. If Mr. Wang is indifferent to her, it is not certain that she will like and fall in love with the boyfriend introduced to her. Judging from the possibility of facts, Mr. Wang's younger aunt may discover more of Mr. Wang's admirable qualities as she meets more people in the future, and truly remain unmarried. Or, after a few years, she may ask Mr. Wang again. Wouldn't this problem still be unresolved at that time? How will you guide her then, Mr. Editor? Will you always oppose her marrying Mr. Wang and sit idly by while she remains unmarried? Therefore, I believe you are directing a tragedy. Perhaps Mr. Wang has already followed your guidance, and the tragedy has already begun. Perhaps the actual environment and objective practice will prove the fallacy of your subjective theory. Mr. Wang betrayed the director and changed the tragedy into a comedy by filming a happy ending.</p>
<p>Please be sure to publish this letter of mine, Mr. Editor. If you think it is correct, please ask Mr. Wang to make a correction! If it is incorrect, either publish it for everyone to discuss, or please, Mr. Editor, reply to it again for correction. I welcome all of these!</p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Li Shirong</p>
<p>Mr. Li's original letter was very long, with more than 2,400 words. Due to space constraints, only a summary can be published. The editor will publish my reply tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Dismissal</h3>
<p>— Tao Ran</p>
<p>That afternoon, typist Li Fan was summoned to the secretary's office. An ordinary typist doesn't easily go there. When Li Fan heard this order, he felt uneasy, wondering if something special had happened.</p>
<p>Secretary Xu was sitting in the secretary's office. On his pointed, thin, melon-seed face, there seemed to be etched deep and severe lines.</p>
<p>"Is your work too mechanical and too monotonous?" The question was too strange, and Li Fan couldn't find anything to answer him.</p>
<p>"I'm asking you to leave this place now!" Secretary Xu issued the dismissal order.</p>
<p>A bolt from the blue struck Li Fan's heart!</p>
<p>After a long pause, he eked out a sentence.</p>
<p>"I didn't expect this!"</p>
<p>"Expect? We don't need your expectations, we've already decided for you here. I'm asking you to leave this place today!"</p>
<p>"But, you should let me know the reason for the dismissal."</p>
<p>"Reason!" Secretary Xu revealed a disdainful expression:</p>
<p>"The director reported that you are unwilling to work here."</p>
<p>Li Fan suddenly understood. He knew that this time the director got married, and he didn't send a heavy enough gift, so he made trouble in front of the secretary and had him dismissed.</p>
<p>"But, Secretary Xu, I have always been dedicated to my work here. I have never disobeyed the director's orders on official matters, and I have never neglected my duties." As he spoke, he pulled out his daily work record from his hand. "This is the director's own handwritten work record report." Indeed, Li Fan had always been diligent in his duties, and Secretary Xu knew this to some extent.</p>
<p>Secretary Xu hesitated a little. "This is based on the director's report. The director reported this way, so we handled it this way." His meaning seemed to be telling Li Fan to ask the director. But Li Fan had always hated this director. The director's meanness and shamelessness were things Li Fan simply couldn't stand. Especially the director's Yama-like sinister face and the night owl-like treacherous laughter made Li Fan disgusted at the mere thought of them.</p>
<p>"I ask Secretary Xu to give me a chance, because what the secretary needs from us is dedication to our duties, not dedication to people." Li Fan thought that these two sentences were very sincere, truthful, and reasonable. However, Secretary Xu became angry. "What?" Two eyes swept across Li Fan's face, like two beams of fire, fiercely.</p>
<p>"I hope..." Before Li Fan could continue, Secretary Xu had already interrupted him, shouting sternly: "Get out, this is not a place for you to speak, get out! Get out!..."</p>
<p>Only authority, only snobbery, truth and light, dressed in the dark cloak. Li Fan couldn't bear the unbearable humiliation and rushed out of the secretary's office in a fit of anger.</p>
<p>Indignation ignited a raging flame in Li Fan's heart, wanting to burn himself, burn the world, burn everything in the world!</p>

<h3>Chastity Memorial Arch (7)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>He felt very sorry for them in his heart, and at the same time, he felt an unspeakable joy in his heart. While watching the crickets eat, he was thinking! Now I am not afraid of my aunt, not afraid of her big-headed ghost. I have caught so many new ones, no matter what, there will always be one who can fight him. Soon he moved out the big round foreign iron bucket and first held a preliminary competition himself. All those who lost were locked in another bamboo cage. Only one cricket defeated three in a row. This cricket was really powerful. Just looking at the number five on its head seemed to prove that it was indeed remarkable. He decided to steal a piece of Korean ginseng for it to eat, and when it fought his aunt's later, it would definitely fight very fiercely.</p>
<p>Shi Min always felt an unspeakable joy, and he was also very anxious. Thinking that in the past few days, more than ten of his crickets had been defeated by her big-headed ghost, but now he believed that he could definitely win a battle, he couldn't help but have his heart beating non-stop. Now everything was ready. After eating ginseng, the cricket seemed to have grown a lot immediately. Just wait for his aunt to finish those trivial things, and then he could have a big fight. It was hard to wait for his aunt to come, and when she saw his cricket, she couldn't help but be surprised. She said:</p>
<p>"Where did you catch such a big one?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know? At the stone memorial arch in the village. Let me tell you, there are so many crickets there, all of them are good. Would you like to go catch them with me tomorrow? It's best to go just as it's getting light."</p>
<p>The aunt ran into the room and took out the best cricket grass. She very carefully and gently drove the two together, letting them stand opposite each other, and both looked like remarkable heroes. At this time, the aunt gently scratched a few times on the butt of his cricket, and it immediately shook its wings and shouted in a rough voice. After a while, it rushed forward, and the big-headed ghost was unwilling to retreat, and immediately bit each other's necks. They were biting fiercely, biting desperately. This one took a step back, and the other one took the opportunity to take a step forward. Soon, the big-headed ghost fell over. Shi Min was simply happy beyond words. But the big-headed ghost was indeed brave. It turned over and bit desperately again. After supporting it for about half a minute, neither side saw defeat. It wasn't until his cricket rushed over and bit the big-headed ghost hard on the belly that the big-headed ghost ran away, and this one chased after it, shouting loudly. Needless to say, Shi Min would be so happy that he would jump up. He shouted:</p>
<p>"The big-headed ghost lost, the big-headed ghost lost!"</p>
