<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯與遠東</h3>
<p>— 舒</p>
<p>國聯行政院將於本月中旬開春季例會。在此次會議中議題。一則爲歐洲系爭中法德間之問題。卽薩爾區之管理問題是也。次爲南美巴拉圭與波利維亞間之戰爭。其於整個世界問題。雖無十分密切關係。然於　聯威信。確有重大的試騐性質。設此區區而竟無法調解。又不能制止其戰爭。則其他較爲鉅大之問題。更將無從措手矣。最重要者卽爲九一八以來轟動全世界。引起搖動遠東局勢。形成世界第二次大戰主要因素之一之一「滿洲問題。」此問題不但使中國一再受辱。陷於極因窘之境地。卽歐美列國亦痛感威脅嚴重。迄今尙無具體應付策略。足以制止日本之橫暴也。</p>
<p>現時國際間主要各國。近皆抛棄國際合作之會議式外交。而醉心於覇權之爭奪。歐洲之情勢如是。遠東亦復如是。德法關係之惡化。歐洲問題之緊張姑暫置不論。卽以一般經濟恐慌深刻之一點論。已足使各國轉移目光。亟注其全力於開拓海外市塲。以圖挽救自身之急難。國際間之諒解。卽不可能。於是遂進而傾向於武力獨占之一策。日本之侵入我東北四省。卽爲其最明顯之證例。在過去二年餘時間。日人早欲單獨侵呑東北。拒絕國際間任何勢力之伸入。然以列强漸次覺醒其於彼權利有礙。起而抗議。日本至是。始知獨力把持遠東之不易。乃有承認國際投資之策劃。一面引入國際資本以爲彼助。一面借此坐實其所謂旣成事實。以發揮其侵略之手腕。</p>
<p>國際聯盟。遠在歐洲本身於遠東利害關係甚微加以日本脫離聯盟。已失去其拘束力。頃者蘇聯加入國聯之說與美國援助國聯之意。雖已盛傳。惟就事實上之觀察。蘇聯之加入國聯。用意亦不過爲何障其西部國境之安全。蓋蘇聯與其　壤諸國。雖已訂立互不侵犯條約。然隣蘇諸國則皆地小力弱。不足爲蘇聯之屏蔽。德國國社黨之愛國主義。又正盡力發展。一朝有事。敦能保障其不衝破小國之境界耶。是知蘇聯之加入國聯。在求已國安全之意義多。而對遠東問題之意義少也。至於美國最多亦僅在道義上給國聯以若干助力。更引伸國際條約之公義。俾野心國家知所警惕而止。此外恐再無實際力量則一般人　預料之矣。</p>
<p>行　　　會之　吾人應充分認議。國　聯盟本爲一道　的　際機關。至實際施行。仍操諸各個國家之手一國際合作之說已成過去。現時各國所努力將事者。在國内爲經濟的國家主義之展佈。在國外爲海外市塲之爭奪。而劃定範圍。以求暫時勢力之均衡。已不可能。英美對日最近表示。皆以自身利益爲言此吾人不能不嚴切注意一也。再則日人侵略野心。决不因國際間之抑制而自歛。其大陸策第二步之推行。在華北陰謀未已。在華南又到處製作禍因。所謂今後「爲台灣時代」之狂囈。已在日閥口中屢言之。此種侵略政策。非有相等實力與之對抗。而僅恃單純外交之力量。决難求其緩和。此吾人須注意者二也。道德制裁。與輿論援助在當今世界中誠爲外交上必備之手段。然必須有實力爲後盾。乃能行之有效所謂「天助自助者。」豈空言也哉。</p>
<h3>經濟戰英對日短兵相接　排斥日貨取堅决行動　英商相定今日發宣言　東京當局愼重籌對策</h3>
<p>（南京）日外務省對三日英商相任錫曼提交日使松平之棉業覺書、認爲極非友誼之牒文、今日雖星期日、外務省道腦部仍往來瀕繁、愼重研究對策、但是否應英方之希望、日内發出回答文乎、尙未决定、外務省雖在該覺書中、窺知英方堅决態度、但爲愼重起見、或待任氏於日内在英下院之關於該問題之聲明後、對英之態度作最後之斷定、然後始决定回答文云、（六日華聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國内閣對於日貨競爭、採取迅速堅决之行動、似已有實施可能、海外貿易大臣考爾維今晚在孟却斯德會議中、以政府名義正式接受藍開厦地方保守黨各團體全國聯合會所通　之兩决議案、考爾維宣稱、貿易大臣任錫　將於下星期一日在下院發表宣言、凡不　於敎府對日貨競爭之態度者、聆此宣言後必可滿意云、關於本問題、目前爭訟最甚者則爲各自治領之態度、自治領態度分爲二方面、一方面主張保持「哇太華會議之精神」、卽帝國内部合作、以防衛外貨競爭、另一方面則以爲目前英國毋國爲保護其本國生　者起見、不得不要求各自治領犧牲、因此各自治領斷難再行放棄其優良之顧主、（日本爲英自治領原料品優良顧主之一）據保守黨或政府機關報之一般印象、似以爲加拿大·澳洲·紐絲倫政府對於毋國因防止日貨競爭所採政府之動機、雖完全表示同情、然不當視爲負有約束、必須遵循毋國之措置、據觀察報謂、「如日本答覆、對英國提議加以拒絕、則英政府對於英帝國各部分之日貨進口、均將採取限止進口數額之辦法、惟此項辦法、尙須與有關係各部分磋商後方可决定、聞各殖民地業已同意此種辦法、至於各自治領則亦完全同情於英内閣之態度」云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>電詢適用地區範圍</h3>
<p>（南京）日外務省關於三日英國之覺書及其後之情報、正在考慮之中、惟英國提案、係抽象的比率品雖限定於棉織物與人造絲類、然關於適用地區、僅言王領帝國、是否僅指殖民地、抑包含自治殖民地自治領、文意不明、昨午後電訓松平駐英大使向英國當局詢問、俟松平大使回答、再考慮對策、是否因日本提出具體案、或再要求英國之積極的提案、俟此種態度决定後、再電訓松平大使、據此以與英國政府折衝、（六日電通電）</p>
<h3>認英覺書性質嚴重</h3>

<h3>日本絲傾銷遇勁敵　意絲奪得波蘭市塲</h3>
<p>華沙日本出品在歐洲市塲之傾銷、今日第一次遭遇一勁敵、蓋日絲與意大利所產之絲、競爭已久、惟前此意大利因成本較大、甚難在波蘭銷售、如某種意絲須售至十四瑞士法郎者、日絲以同樣之質地僅售十三法郎、惟現在意絲竟低售至十二法郎、此爲最低之價、若日絲欲再低减、則非蒙重大之損失不可云、（五日國民電）</p>
<h3>赫爾　警告黷武國家　好戰服上刑　世界民族速自覺悟</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國務總理赫爾今日對坎白蘭大學同學會演說、發出一種警告、謂現有黷武主義之危險、如無國際增進和平諒解與友誼之合作、則此黷武主義將蔓延于世界各處、今日許多國家方積極擴充軍備、搜括民脂、並以種種方法提倡黷武精神、雖目前各處未有戰禍立將爆發之徵象、但世界許多地方、確有嚴重危機、如火山之可隨時进發、文明人類如對于目前危險的趨勢依然漠視、則實爲大錯、且亦爲罪恶、渠自己並不失望、蓋渠確知世界各處人民、必能迅速覺悟復歸眞理之必要也、美國在此方面可貢獻其有價値之役務、在新近數月内、美國已以政治上經濟上社會上與道德上復興之相當程序、貢獻賢明穩健而有效率之指導、今後可繼續爲之云云、（六日路透電）</p>

<h3>意相之黃禍論　爲白人前途抱隱憂</h3>
<p>米蘭　意大利民報今日發表一文、似出墨索里尼首相手筆、該文稿向白種人提出警告、稱白種民族應視爲前途之隱憂云、該文引證法國威權學者李齊敎授近著、而命其文曰、「白種人生殖之退步與黃種人之進步」、該文稱「李齊敎授明白指證黃種人及混合種人數量之增加、超過白種人五六倍、其結論稱、假定前之生產率無變動、則二十年内東京將成爲世界人口最多之都市」云、（五日國民電）</p>
<h3>日伸張勢力意國不容漠視　隱或將向列强建議　隱對日施共同行動</h3>
<p>羅馬　意大利政界對於日本向英美政府所提出關於對華政策之說明、視爲絕難滿意、意大利報紙數家對於英美之樂觀態度、殊未同意、以爲日本勢力向遠東非洲大陸逐步擴張、至堪憂慮、意國深懼日本阻塞意國在民界各處之貿易發展、並以爲就國際觀點而論、日本之態度實多危險云、由此推測、則意國或將向列强建議、對日施行共同防衛行動、亦未可知也、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）「白日報」駐羅馬訪員著文、論意大利對於最近日本對中國事件聲明書之態度、略謂「吾人苛不加深思、輒懷疑於遠東問題關係意國、未必如此重大、然苟就最近數月來之多種事變加以考慮、則乃知此種事變、固屬一線相承、互相聯貫者也、當去年十二月亞洲學生大會在羅馬開會時、意相墨索里尼發表演說、謂世界共同和平之使命、向在於羅馬與亞洲之團結、以今視昔、尤有甚焉云云、嗣後意大利各報卽紛紛著文、反對日本在世界市塲之傾銷政策、迨三月十八日墨索里尼在國立歌劇院向泛繋黨要人演說、雖稱意大利無物質侵略之野心、但主張意國應在菲洲亞洲發展其工商業、厥後日本謀在菲洲阿比西尼亞國獲得種植棉花之特許權、並謀以日本貴族名媛遣嫁阿比西尼亞王太子、意大利對此兩事、均經提出抗議、同時據羅馬方面一般之觀察、蘇聯外交家曾暗中有所活動、蘇聯駐意大使間嘗故作危言、以聳動墨索里尼之聽聞、因此此間人士頗信日本自以爲有相當凖備、以作决定之行動、甚且以爲東京政府領袖已確定發動戰爭之時日、且自法國與意大利對於歐洲政治主要各點意見漸趨接近以來、意大利頗思與法國協調、以圖伸張勢力於亞洲、不寗唯是、就最近事變觀之、日本與德國未免聲氣相求、日本之政策與德國之政策殊多融合之點、此中情形、意大利亦注意及之、就各方面參證所得之確實消息、目前羅馬政府領袖之見解、不外乎此云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>中國排日情形、在大勢上觀之、已頗和緩、關於最近外務省發表對華外交之聲明、一時頗給與相當之衝動、但大局上之對日感情、近已甚爲和緩、而經濟界因其内地共匪跋扈、天災頻仍、故其購買力極形萎縮、商業亦至爲疲弊、棉業亦受其影響、大致均屬蕭條、中國紡績則决計减少工作二成三、日商紗廠除上海以外、爲開拓印度南洋等處之販路計、故比較華人方面工率之减少釋度尙少、當不失爲佳况、中國爲保護其產業而號稱抵制日貨、反使中國經濟界爲之萎靡不振、實乃其重要之原因、亦可謂奇怪之現象、中國人對於此點、似經覺悟、故排日風潮亦爲之和緩、此則中日兩國至堪慶賀之情形也云云、（六日日聯電）</p>

<h3>阿剌伯戰爭内幕　定英意奪紅海控制權　定漢志軍械出自英助　定意在葉門有潛勢力</h3>
<p>（巴黎）「時報」社論評論阿接伯半島葉門王國之事變、首述漢志與葉門開戰之原因、謂漢志國王伊平薩和特征服亞西爾地方（在漢志與葉門兩國之間）後、該地領袖不甘受「華哈皮脫」派（漢志國回敎中狂熱信敎之敎派）之控制、羣起叛變、葉門國王本哈米特予以庇護、並予援助、於是伊平薩和特赫然震怒、統率軍隊親往討伐、葉門軍隊器械寙劣、紀律不良、卒致敗北、葉門國王在阿拉伯半島英國保護地帶、施行陰謀、並力圖開發荷台達港（在紅海東岸）、以削减英屬亞丁港之繁榮、因此招致英國之猜忌、此外葉門國王爲防衛國境抵抗漢志起見、橫征暴歛、人民不勝負担、加以政治不良、各山地部落皆表示不滿、現且拒絕援助本哈米特、葉門國王戰敗後、請求埃及國王福亞出而仲裁、但福亞聞將加以拒絕、目前葉門國薩亞納地方已起叛變、恐本哈米特之政權勢將顚覆、而不可收拾矣、至於漢志王伊平薩和特則頗有深謀遠慮、其親信顧問英人費爾比、曾於三月二十四日在泰晤士報投寄一函、預料漢志與葉門兩國將發生事故、今果不出所料、漢志王伊平薩和特雖堅持阿拉伯民族主義、反對外國勢力之侵入、但其手段靈敏、頗得衆助、漢志軍隊器械精良、軍實充裕、實出英國之助、此外意大利潛勢力、對於葉門外交政策或不無關係、此說雖僅屬臆測、尙無事實爲證、但意大利在葉門國内有利益關係、且葉門軍隊中、有若干意國軍官担任敎練、則固信而有徵、至謂漢志與葉門兩國戰爭内幕、實係兩大　暗鬭互爭紅海入口地帶之控制權、則未可遽爾而致信也云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美司法長　定解釋瓊森法案　定英意等非愆付戰債國　定蘇俄前債未淸得適用</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國國會前經通過參議員瓊森所提出之法案、規定對於愆付債務之國家、美國應停止財政援助、此項法案於四月十二日由斯福總統簽署、成爲法律、惟此項法律實施時、作如何解釋、則由司法部長克明斯加以研究、發表結論、頃國務院宣稱、對於克明斯之結論完全同意、克明斯解釋該法律之結論、謂依照江森法律條文、英國及與英國情形相類之國家、如捷克·意大利·拉特維亞·立陶宛等國、因曾部份付欵、截至目前爲止不能認爲對美愆付債務、至於愆付債務國定之下級政府如市政府等、如該市政府本身並未愆付對美債務、則不適用瓊森法律、換言之、卽對該市政府仍得與以財政援助、又加拿大雖爲英帝國之一部份、亦不適用瓊森法律、此外匯兌交易·郵政匯兌·期票支票·及其他執行銀行業務之通常手段、則不在本法律限制之内、但在美國發售有價證券及債券、用於供給資財於愆付債務國之政府者、則得適用本法律、加以禁止、至於蘇聯政府對於俄國前歷届政府負欠債務之責任問題、則美國態度與國際法上一般所承認之原則完全一致、卽蘇聯政府應作爲愆付債務而論、蓋確定俄國對美債務總額之談判、雖正在進行中、但如因此認爲愆付債務之情形業已消失、則斷無法律原則可以依據也云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）頃據國務院聲明、克明斯對於江森法律之解釋、尙有補充各節、卽謂英國及情形相類似之各國已付到期戰債之一部份者、截至目前爲止、雖並不認爲愆付債務、但此等國家如不欲受江森法律之打撃、則將來必須付淸全部到期戰債而後可、國務院此項意見、極關重要、蓋因本年六月十五日到期戰債、爲日已近故也、又國務院方面以爲克明斯對於江森法律之解釋、乃欲儘量限制該法律之適用範圍、僅以對美國政府愆付債務之國家爲限、其對美國各銀行或對美國國民愆付債務之國家、則不適用本法律、因此對於拉丁美洲諸國、卽不適用江森法律、按國會通過江森法律時、本意在將拉丁美洲諸國與欠戰債各國、同樣待遇、今加以此種解釋、實大可注目也、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>春秋御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯　（五）隨駕大臣　　　　我時常在想：如果朝廷上没有了這些外貎似乎很端莊嚴肅的大臣之後，國家的一切政事，會不會就此停領：或者只是像一頭馬去掉了它的長尾巴一般的絕不發生影響。因爲我瞧他們除掉在太后跟前端端整整地站着之外，便没有别的事情幹了，所以使我對於他們的能力和功用，不得不發生子一種懷疑。　我所知道，無論在什麽時候，無論爲着什麽事情，從没有一個大臣敢爽爽快快地發表過他的意見的。照理講，他們的本職原是要輔佐太后丨也就是要他們盡量向太后貢獻意見，使太后把一切政務，都能處理得中正妥善，但是因爲他們過於畏懼太后的緣故，於是太后所聽到的，便祇是些故意要迎合伊自己的意思的空論，或是那些可以使伊歡喜的謊報。（寫到這裏，我又想起我父親所告訴我的關於甲午年中日戰爭的故事來了。據說自始至終，淸廷各大臣所奏給慈禧聽的戰報，老是「我軍大勝」，「我軍連捷的虚話，」直到中國艦隊全軍覆没，伊還不曾接到確息。唯一的原因，就爲各大臣都知道太后聽到了戰敗的消息，一定是要着惱的，所以没人敢說眞話了。）　　在這一列御用列車上，少不得也有一輛車是指定給這些大臣們棲息的。可是詫異得很。雖然這些隨駕大臣丨從最高級的到最低級的丨都是很擁擠地羣聚在一輛車上，而那太監總管李蓮英，却是一個人獨佔着一輛車，且又佈置得十分富麗，僅稍次太后的一輛車而已。這又不能不說是一種奇蹟丨（二七）四月十七日  乃令　　崇信天主敎的法國人，是否也像我們中國人一樣，有所謂「淸明」·有所謂「掃墓」的事？因爲我不是「法國通」，所以對於這一點，在以前是全不曉得，而且也是絕不關心的！　　不過，四月十七日這天的下午，從我寄寓的北窗望下去，在一個法國人的公墓裏，我看見許多的法國男女：有老的，有小的；有先已點着一根白洋燭，虔敬的站在豎着十字架的墓前的；也有正携着滿袋的祭物跑進了墓來的。　　他們的祭物是什麽呢？據我的眼力所看到的，是些染了五顏六色的蛋，精緻的蛋糕，蒸好了的飯，還有的是鮮花。　　這時候，又跑來了一個老頭，手裏提一個小布袋。他跑到每個墓前，也裝着虔敬的樣子，像人家一樣劃十字架，用右手在上點一點，在下點一點，在左點一點，又在右點一點。然後，他不客氣的向人家討賞錢了；人家也絕不吝嗇地給他錢，給他蛋跟蛋糕。跟着，一個穿黃袍的神父來了，他替人家爲墓中人祈禱：祈禱的時候，口裏念念有詞，手裏携有一小個香爐，用繩繋着，左右的擺動，做出一種怪異的樣子。禱畢，人家把錢放在他手裏，而且還吻着他的手。神父微笑地跑開了，到第二個墓前去。　四月十七日的所見，令我聯想到「虔敬死了的人」的心，是舉世的人都有的神女  花鈴　　某一天晚上，從外埠回到上海。到埠時，已在午夜後的二點多鐘了，回家罷，夜深了，路又遠，敲門打戶，驚鄰動舍的覺得不方便，而且天又下着毛毛雨，於是就在埠頭上的一家客寓裏「打尖」。　　茶房照例地送進來了一盆面水，一壺茶。接着竟臉上堆滿了笑問我可要招一個姑娘來玩玩。　　這倒引起了我的好奇心，因爲據我所知道的，在這埠頭上，是不比租界中心的那幾條馬路，旅館裏是不藏春色的。但是茶房既在幹着介紹的工作，我倒得見識一下了。於是微笑着點了一點頭。　　隔了不到抽完一支捲烟的工夫，門口裏已踅進來了一位姑娘，穿的是假毛葛的棉旗袍，脚上穿着套鞋，臉上的脂粉，也搽得不怎麽匀凈，模樣兒，並不像是神女。　　問了年歲籍貫之後，又和伊間談了一陣，才知這一個可憐的女子，本來是在一家手工廠裏做工的。家裏還有一個不能行動的父親，一個替人家洗衣的母親，和一個七歳的弟弟。在前一個月裏，廠倒閉了。家裏維持不住，於是只得賣淫了。因爲伊今年還只十四歲，又生得瘦弱，所以賣淫了二個月，還末接過十位客人。　　一陣難受，襲上我的心頭，便丢給了伊一塊錢，打發伊回去，忙息燈安睡。東北四連長  張恨水第二十八回　　巧合共觀塲痴情拾帕殷勤兩問疾誤會投書　　積之只管把這件事顚三倒四的想着，心裏有如熱火燒，熱水澆，說不出是怎樣不舒服坐不住了，便在床上躺下。自己用手摸摸頭，似乎有些燙手。再摸摸手心，也有些發燒，那麽，糊裏糊塗的，就害上相思病了。既然，要過舊歷年，就不能不該忌諱，正月初一，家裏閙病人，恐怕哥嫂不滿意，還是含糊着不要說出來罷。他是這樣的想了，所以自己雖然躺在床上，却也點了一枝洋燭，放在床頭邊茶几上，然後拿了一本書，高高的睡在枕上來看。殊不想息己越掙扎，這病勢來得越兇猛，到了後來，頭上如加了百十斤的石磨，胸裏翻騰作吐，不但是不能看書，便是靜靜的躺着，也有些支持不住了。在床上左翻右轉，嘔吐了兩陣，情不自禁，呻吟了幾聲。這就把厚之驚動子，帶着聽差，跑進房來探望。他弟積之睡在枕頭的一邊，面白如紙，微微閉着眼睛，只管喘氣。厚之倒大吃一驚。他如何會得了這樣的急病？趕快用手去摸摸積之的額頭，燒得燙手。因問道：積之，你吃壞了什麽東西吗，積之微睜着眼搖了兩搖頭。厚之道：你到那裏去了？積之雖是病重，心裏却是明白的，若說是同趙翁聽戲去了，有桂枝在内，恐怕引起不便，因之就含混着說，並没有到什麽地方去，只是在街上隨便走走，看看人家門口的春聯。厚之道：這就是了。外面天氣很凉，你在熱屋子裏，突然出去，吹了冷風，受了凉，中了感冒了，這樣夜深，又是正月初一，找醫生可不容易，找藥也不好辦。（三七八）字紙篇的力量九國公約　　古寺浩刦  兪友淸　　今歳上己辰，我邑虞山四大寺之一，藏海寺忽發生火災，焚去房屋十數間，併死者三，誠名山之浩刦也。回憶數年前，上己拜香，西門發生擁擠，死者十餘人，因拜香而成巨厄，此是第二次，不可不記。　　藏海寺，一名拂水禪院，在望海墩之南，維摩寺之西，明洪武四年，僧道原改建，今亦稱藏海禪院，俗名祖師山，又名報恩寺，因上已有拜香報娘恩之俗。門外有石橋，跨山澗，此處卽名拂水巖，橋俗名長壽橋，每過雨後，澗水流注，橋下懸爲瀑布，風自南來，則倒捲而上，卽天己放睛，仍濛濛作細雨，鬱爲奇景，故名拂水。在拂水禪院之前，爲虞山之向陽最秀雄處，以崖裂如劈，故昔人以蜀道之名而名之。按劍門相傳爲吳王試劍處，削壁高十餘丈，令人不可仰視，由此而下，徑愈險，不可駐足，石上有烟嵐高曠，是康熙南巡所書，另有宋楊延照殺敵處字樣，爲虞山最著名處。此次受災，損失甚大，主持者戒非上入，能詩善文，亦雅僧也。拙著虞山小誌中，詳述名勝古蹟甚夥，故不贅，該寺保藏之松禪南海書件，未知無恙否？短篇小說賽會  朱𦐂　　轟動全鎭的ＸＸ會，經鄕人們努力的奮鬥，已在這天舉行了。　　ＸＸ會的能够舉行，確是鄕人們精神努力的表演。尤其在城隍已由山上移駐到了火神廟裏，各項儀仗，都已凖備，鄕人們正興高彩烈，四下去嗚鑼聚衆的時候。那縣政府與公安局會銜禁止賽會的布告，突然張貼到火神廟裏，給鄕人們一種最嚴重的障礙。那鄕長徐伯洪爲打破這嚴重障礙，特率領了各村長，親自向當局請願；一方更拜望著名邑紳代爲疏通。所以這天ＸＸ會能够舉行，徐鄕長的熱忱和功德，眞是値得鄕人們歌頌和感佩的。　　平日冷淸清的村落，這天到處現出不平凡的熱閙。柳陰和桑柘叢中，隨處都擠滿了老老少少的村人；婦女的身上，都穿着最美麗的衣衫；至少一件靑布的外衣，是洗得乾乾凈凈。那小孩子們，更像小貓一般，東串西走，滿現着快樂的神情。田　上來來往往的人中，也不時發見穿着長衣的男子。在鄕人們熱閙的期望中，鏜鏜的鑼聲，愈響愈近；在參差的樹木中，那會裏的大旗，像　翼般愈展愈大，漸漸的，人頭也瞧得見了，隊伍也瞧得見了，那「彭拍」的爆竹，也瞧得見一個個升起來，在樹梢頭爆裂，紙屑雪花似的紛飛。　　在春雷般的歡迎聲裏，ＸＸ會的隊伍，已緩緩地湧現出來。第一是執着「肅靜」「廻避」行牌的頂馬，這確是神權高於一切，鄕人們一見那對肅靜牌；立刻都肅靜起來；一班上了年紀的老嫗，更頓時大宣其「南無阿彌陀佛」的佛號。而預備然放的爆竹的人，也立刻燃放爆竹，那紅燭香烟，更到處供奉出來。　　賽會中的儀仗。盛極一時；一對對儀容肅穆的皂隸，音樂悠揚的國樂隊蟬聯着緩緩過去，最使鄕人們瞧得出神的，有十二架抬擱；那抬擱山四個粗壯的男子抬着，上面的小兒女，扮着戲劇的故事，袍笏登摥，巍巍地高過屋簷。那抬擱上的人物，在出巡的當兒，還在曼聲地唱着悅耳的小調。　　會中第二出色的，當然要推臂鑼，臂香，最出風頭了。那班人物，都是一色的單褲，腰裏束着白色絲帶，那絲帶在這班人物健步競走的時候，飄飄然别有一番風光。這班人物，都赤着上身，將健美的肉體，公開展覽，他們伸直的右臂上，在那手腕那兒，貫着鐵鈎，鈎上懸着香罏，或大鑼；香罏中　　地吐着濃烟，那掛大鑼的人物，在健步的時候，更鏜鏜地把鑼，敲得一片價響。　　此外還有高過屋簷的高蹺，在那高低不平的路上，迅速地飛奔，也使鄕人瞧着，不由不歡呼起來。　　會中一隊隊的人馬，宛宛地過去，在執扇紅傘之後，就是三尊威靈顯赫的神像，坐在軒轎中，吆吆喝喝的抬將過來。鄕人們一見神面，大都鞠躬合掌，表示敬意。而一班婦女，更不顧一切，俯伏在地上僕僕膜拜。　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　某鄕的賽會出過的明白，除了火神廟外張貼着一張用去五千四百八十七元Ｘ角Ｘ分的淸單，和那禁止賽會的布告，並列牆上外，ＸＸ報上也刋載一則新聞：「ＸＸ會中，共跌傷高蹺二人，臂香五人，及小孩老人，被擠受傷的Ｘ人，現已一併山當局送往ＸＸ醫院治療。………」</p>

<p>經濟專刊每星一出逢期日版第三次檢政會議之展望  連林　　商品檢騐具有兩重目的，在消極方面說，一方面是取締國外劣品的輸入，尤其是附有蟲害的農產品，以免爲害於本國商品，一方面是禁止本國劣品的出口，以固國貨在海外市塲的信用，並避免國貨出口後因品質而產生的爭執。但商品檢騐的目的决不僅止於此，它還有積極的一方面，卽以之促進本國商品的改良，與國際貿易的發展。　　商品檢騐政策是隨着國際貿易的發展而產生，它在歐美各國，也不過祇有數十年的歷史，在中國，歷史更短，總共不過五載，在這五年中，上海·靑島·漢口·廣州·天津五處的商品檢騐局先後成立，在中國國際貿易史上，佔有重要的一頁。但一方面爲日尙淺，一方面因商民對於檢政性質的不明確，有許多事情，均仍不免有扞格不通之處，行政當局也有鑒於此，故爲增進檢政成效起見，在過去曾已舉行過二次全國檢政會議。檢閱過去議案以及實施的成績，自不能說已臻於止境，故今年五月七日又有第三次檢政會議的召集。　　對於五月七日開會第三次檢政會議，我們站在發展國際貿易，增進檢政成效的觀點，自然抱有很大的奢望。前途成效如何，會議的本身，雖則没有實際的力量，尙須視諸將來執行者努力如何爲定，而這次會議的議案，固不必專注於檢騐的技術問題，對於下面的幾點，似有討論之必要。　　第一，對於檢政的認識與其運用的改變　普通人對於商品檢騐的認識，不過是很單純的鑒定商品的合格與否以定進出口的允准與否而已。實則這種在形式上雖似很簡單的東西，隨着運用者的不同，可以發生很不同的意義。在過去，中國的檢政未免蹈着單純性的道路，目前因時勢的不同與客觀的需要，自必有轉變對於檢政性質的認識與運用的必要。　　舉例來說，中國要發展經濟建設，大家均已公認非實行統制經濟不可，在統制經濟前提下，國際貿易必需統制起來，卽國營。但因客觀環境的複雜，欲達到完全統制的目的，自非短時間内所能行，但爲因地制宜，逐步推行起見，商品檢騐實是推行經濟統制及貿易統制的最好的工具。在統制經濟下，商品進出口的數量固有一定限制，商品的品質也有一定的規定，商品檢騐不但可執行商品品質的規定，在相當程度内，還可執行商品進出口數量的限制。　　再以復興農村來說，誰都知道要復興中國的農村，第一步必須阻止進口農產物的傾銷，實施傾銷稅及洋米進口稅的目的，也不過是如此。但欲阻止進口農產物的傾銷，固無論傾銷稅法的一時難行，而其成效實還不如商品檢騐爲大。如應用商品檢騐來限制外國農產物的進口，則可將品質標凖提高，尤其是實施進口農產物病蟲害檢騐，務使進口農產物在疾病傳染上不足爲害於本國農產，卽在市塲關係上也不致打撃本國農產物的銷售。　　所以這是中國商品檢騐的根本方針，有待於這次會議予以具體而愼密的確定的。　　第二，對於商品檢騐法的商榷丨民國二十一年十二月十四日國民政府公佈商品檢騐法共十九條，使商品檢騐的行政當局及商人，都得有一定規程，以資遵循，且使各局都可依據該法而統一起來，自屬可喜之事。不過該法對於檢政的前途，關係過大，且在民國二十一年時制定，如上文所言，由於國家新的經濟建設政策的施行，對於檢政的根本方針有所列改時，那麽此法自必先有商榷的必要。　　卽以目前情形，就商品檢騐法的本身來說，也頗有可資商榷的地方。譬如該法第五條是：　　「應施檢騐之外國商品持有出品國政府檢騐證書者，得以相互待遇，酌免檢騐，但發見與原證書不符時，仍須檢騐。」這實是不明檢政之根本精神。第一，商品檢騐並不是和關稅恊定一樣，而有什麽互惠的原則，卽使在互惠原則之下，中國對互惠國出口商品可不受該國之檢騐，但劣品出口或因此而引起雙方商人因品質問題而發生的爭執，敢殊非檢政所具有的改進商品品質及提高國際信譽之道。第二，如因互惠關係，對於别國商品進口不予檢騐，則流弊殊甚，其中尤以農業病蟲害之有傳染性者爲更烈。如（民二十年南京中央日報載）「輸入日本之蜂，僅憑該國養蜂恊會千篇一律之無病證書，進口如故，因輸用之多，竟將惡劣蜂羣混入，我國人損失，當在三百萬元以上。查蜂病之中，以幼兒腐臭敗病爲最烈，且此病病菌，多潛伏於舊脾陳密，一經傳染，全塲有覆滅之虞，」卽其一例。該法第七條爲：　　「檢騐商品得酌收檢騐費，其費額由實業部就各商品分别定之，但至多不得逾該商品市價千分之三。」商品檢騐與關稅不同，商品檢騐局决不能和稅收機關同視，按照歐美各國的成例，國家對於檢政，均有一筆規定的經費，所檢騐的商品，大多數不取費。今中國商品檢騐，須取多少費用，那祇能視爲一種現在財政拮据下通融辦法。不過，如就取費而言，也决不能和徵稅似的以「從價」的百分率來計算，須以商品的數量及檢騐手續的繁簡，來定取費的標凖。該法第六條爲：　　「商品檢騐給證後，如未經商品檢騐局核准，私自變更包裝者，應重行檢騐。」實則祇須檢騐合格，未違反第十五條所規定「商品檢騐後有擅改數量或混入劣品者」，似不應更予苛求。譬如上海進口之糖品，業經上海商品檢騐局合格，爲運銷内地，不得不變包裝時，如必須重騐，則豈非病民重累？　　凡此各點，都値得再予商榷，雖則這次會議没有變更立法的權，但討論所得，自必可供立法當局的參考，不難因此而使商品檢騐法更臻於完善。　　第三，現行檢政之應需改進的各點丨一卽就現然而論，商品檢騐也有多端爲亟宜改進者，試舉一二，述之如下：　　第一，雖說全國已有五個商品檢騐局，而且都在重要的貿易口岸，且每局之下，尙有附設的分處，但商品檢騐機關終究未能普遍，產地檢騐也是一樣，這種情形下，常使全國商人出口也不能有均等待遇，有的地方進口商品須要檢騐，有的却可不要，劣品的進口也是一樣，在這個港埠不能進口或出口的，在别的地方却可進口或出口，全國的檢騐事業應該通盤籌劃一下，用國家的大力量來積極擴充。務使達到全國爲本位的商品檢騐目的。　　第二，就現在而論，開騐的商品雖已有多種，但大部還是没有實施檢騐，如急不容緩的植物病蟲害檢騐到現在還付缺如。進口商品之受檢騐的，爲數更少。　　第三，各地商品檢騐局的檢騐商品標凖應該統一，而且商品分級的標凖應該早日規定，以使各局均能遵循同一的標准進行。各種重要食糧如米麥等分級標凖，應該早日規定，俾商人有所遵循，不但可以免去買賣間許多無謂之爭執，同時食糧的品質也可以提高。　　這不過是愚者一得，聊爲舉例而已，希望這次的會議能超越前二次，而獲得良好的結果，使中國的檢政，在通盤計劃之下，走上健全的路，達到其完善的目標。實施植物病蟲害檢騐之重要性  耐公　　植物病蟲害之檢騐，首創於德國，法奥瑞比諸邦繼之，美國之實施，僅二十餘年事耳，迄今世界各國，幾無不施行植物病蟲害檢騐者，但在我國，仍付闕如，在無形中已淪爲世界劣質植物傾銷市塲，貿易上之漏巵固多，而受傳入蟲菌之损害尤大。舉凡紅鈴蟲。線座　，玉蜀黍黑穗病等，無一非由海外傳入。近來流行頗　，幾無地無之。農業上之損失，有非吾人意　所能及者。其他未傳入而有傅入可能性之蟲菌亦在在堪虞，卽以棉鈴象鼻蟲論，在美國異常猖獗，每年損失二萬萬至四萬萬金元，農民疾　　額，徒喚奈何，如不幸傅入中國，則棉業前途，何堪設想，且異地傳入之蟲菌，其爲書之烈，每　原產地而上之。蓋各國之環境不同，氣候互異，蟲菌之在原產地者，往往受天然仇敵與氣候之制裁，或因寄主抵抗力之强大，而不克大肆猖獗，一旦遷至異域，頓失其天然平衡狀態，每致釀成巨禍。如　國由中國傅入之舍來　介殼蟲，法國由美國傅入葡萄霜黴病，皆其明證也。雖然，此僅就防止國外病蟲害一方面而言之耳。若以對外貿易論，吾國輸出棉物，向無法定機關之檢騐證明，連年所遭損失，尤屬可驚，良以農民昧於病蟲害防治手續，輸出棉物之附帶蟲菌者，比比皆是，被各國檢騐機關橫加擯斥，全部慘遭燬棄者有之，責令　回原產地者亦有之，甚至以染有危險病蟲爲口實，禁止中國重要植物生產品進口。試閱左表，不難瞭然。茲將各國禁止中國植物進口種類列左：（瑞典）生活榆科植物。（丹麥）樅樹及榆樹。（墨西哥）種子。（百慕大）（一）　蔔之未經製造手續者，一律禁止進口。（二）香蕉植物之全株或一部，除果實外，一律禁止進口。（三）水仙屬及百合屬之鱗莖。（四）生活金　草。　　（新西蘭）（一）梨，蘋果，及　　植物之全株或一部，除果實外，一律禁止進口。（二）葡萄物之全株或一部，除果實外，一律禁止進口。（三）柑橘植物之全株或一部，除果實外，一律禁止進口。　　（加拿大）五葉松，醋栗，桃金孃，凡锯栗，山栗，歐洲　者，伏牛花，阿謨藥，耐性藥，加拿大業，四比利亞藥，叢藥，小藥，十大功勞，及恶當斯太蒙，一律禁止進口。　　（澳洲聯邦）（一）核果植物之全株或一部。（二）仁果植物及薔薇科植物之全株或一部。（三）烟草植物之全株或一部。（四）桃金孃植物之全株或一部。（五）仙人掌植物之全株或一部。（六）　。（七）柑橘果實。（八）棉籽。（九）馬薯。（七）蘋果梨及榲桲之在澳洲機部登岸者。　　（日本）新鮮胡瓜，西瓜，甜瓜，南瓜與其他葫蘆科植物果實，以及番茄荳豇豆等。　　（美國本部）（一）竹之全體切株及種子之能供繁殖用者，一律禁止進口。（二）草棉植物及其生產品，一律禁止進口，除包括植物全體與未經製造手續之花衣種子外，一切癈花及包裝品之曾用爲貯藏棉花者，亦在禁止之列。（三）各種白松醋栗及桃金孃植物，一律禁止進口。（四）各種小麥及其生產品，除經完善製造手續之麵粉外，一律禁止進口。（五）玉蜀黍，帝蜀黍，甜粟蘆粟，蘇丹草，約翰生草，珍珠粟，蘇格蘭草，體完心草，仁與薏苡之莖葉及其他部份之未經製造手續者，除乾凈玉蜀黍種子外，一律禁止進口。（六）各種柑橘植物之全株或一部，除温橘外，一律禁止進口。（七）馬鈴著之全株或一部，一律禁止進口。（八）各種番著與山藥之全株或一部，一律禁止進口。（九）水稻植物及其生產品，除經完善製造手續之白米外，一律禁止進口。（十）各種香蕉植物之全株或一部，除果實外，一律禁止進口。（十）（一）甘蔗之全株或一部，一律禁止進口。（十）（二）各種新鮮果品，除温橘香蕉鳳梨及歐洲種葡萄外，一律禁止進口。　　（菲列濱）芭蕉，椰子，甘蔗，水稻鳳梨，竹，烟草，柑橘，龍舌蘭，西沙亞麻，咖啡，及含羞　草植物之全株或一部，律禁止進口。　　（夏威夷）（一）各種新鮮果實。（二）香蕉植物及果實。（三）甘蔗植物及果實。（四）風梨植物及果實。（五）竹玉蜀黍，及粟之全株或一部。（六）咖啡植物及種子。（七）攙雜之飼料作物種子。（八）五葉松醋栗屬及果羅屬植物之全株或一部。（九）棉籽及棉殼。（十）柑橘類苗木一色括果芽接木及種子。（十）（一）印度玉蜀黍及薏苡植物之全株或一部。（十）（二）砧木切株接木及接芽。（十）（三）水稻種子。（十）（四）凡能繁殖之植物及其生產　品而由郵局遞寄者，除作蔬茶及花卉種子外，一律禁止進口。　　（比利時）葡萄植物之全株或一部，除果實外，一律禁止進口。　　（希臘）（一）凡葡萄藤之全株或一部動植物之廢棄部分腐植質與土壤新鮮植物之全株或一部（包括荒菜）茜草以及甘草之由國外輸入者，一律禁止進口。（二）凡柑橘果實除由舍來斯及梅舍桐里兩地輸入外，一律禁止進口。（三）棉籽輸入舍來斯與梅舍桐里以及籽棉輸入任何希臘部分，一律禁止進口。　　（智利）（一）具模之萄萄藤。（二）美國之桃樹。（三）附帶土壞之植物。（四）新鮮植物生產品之能傅　　播果蜿者（五）玉蜀黍（連穗）及帶蜀黍。（六）馬鈴著。　　（那成）（一）凡桃金孃植物及斯鮮果實，不准輸入滗杏加當或其愈北地帶。（二）凡有馬鈴著癌腫病存在國家之馬鈴著，一律不准進口。（三）凡榆屬植物一律禁止進口。（四）凡由國外輸入之開花球莖，一律禁止進口。（五）凡由國外輸　布　　植物，一律禁止進口。　　（印度）（一）凡由國外輸入之另啡植物及種子，一律不准進口。（二）亞麻種子及埃及苴蓿種子，蜚持有農業部之執照，不准進口。（三）棉籽不准由海道或朋拜進口。　　（德國）（一）葡萄苗木之全株或一部，一律禁止進口。（二）各種生活雙子葉植物之全株或一部，一律禁止進口。　　（一）凡由國外輸入之蘇格蘭與愛爾蘭之檜屬樅屬落葉松屬針樅屬松屬假栂屬，西　屬側柏屬及栂屬植物之全株或一部，一律禁止進口。　　近代國家往往運用檢騐政策，以謀阻止外國植物之進口。表面上所持之理由，非不堂堂正正，以科學爲護符，而一考其内幕，率皆鈎心鬥角，各逞私圖。對於進口植物之檢騐，限制惟恐不嚴，出口植物之檢騐，手續深懼不簡，循環報復，形成今日檢騐壁壘對立之局面，設計固工，其如防礙國際貿易何，植物檢騐之目的，在保護國内農業生產及增進輸出植物信用。光明磊落，無可非議，然欲獲得圓滿之結果，須在不背檢騐原則之下，力謀世界合作，排除貿易障礙。禁止種類，固應嚴密考慮，檢騐手續，亦宜設法統一。否則各就本國之立塲，單獨行動，損人利己之事，將層出而不窮，馴至國際貿易之戰爭，愈形尖銳化，殊于檢騐本旨，大相背謬，是爲各國當局所應深切注意者也。吾國檢騐事業，自民國十八年以來確有相當之進展。在過去五年中，滬漢津靑等通商口岸，相率設立專局，執行商品檢騐事宜。商民稱便，與論翕然。其中上海商品檢騐局之措施，尤能引起國際問之重視，惜各局檢騐之物品，仍屬少數，進口商品之施行檢騐者，僅肥料火酒糖類數項而已。現値復興農村聲浪。高唱入雲之際，植物病蟲害之檢騐，更爲刻不容緩之要圖，否則中國植物在國際市塲中之地位，行將喪失盡凈，同時因國外危險蟲菌之傳入，益陷農業于萬刦不復之域。瞻仰前侘，不寒而慄，今後惟望政府與人民立于一條戰綫上，共同奮鬥，一方面斟酌國内生產情形，斷然禁止或限止外國植物之輸入，一方面厲行出口檢騐，使中國植物在國際間取得貿易均等機會。此實應付帝國主義經濟侵略下之特殊辦法，枊亦受關稅恊定束縛之中國，所應取之戰略，幸勿目爲尋常問題而忽之也。綠茶着色檢騐之補救  陸輝　　綠茶爲中國特產之一，對外貿易，遍及美·法·菲·俄等處，尤以美國爲主要銷塲，遠於一八八○年至一九○○年間，中國綠茶銷美，恒在三四十萬擔之鉅，稱著全美，基礎之深，逈非他國產品所能望其項背。考其所以能使美洲人士之嗜好華茶者，蓋由中國綠茶品質淸潔，不僅香氣馥郁，風味淸妙，使飲者彌覺愉快，有滌除腸胃，興　精神，增益人體之效能，有以致之。詎意十九世紀初葉以迄比年綠茶美銷，大見衰落。一九二七年乃降至八萬餘擔，同時日本緣茶反得暢銷於美境，廠結所在，固有多端，而華茶「著色」守乃最大原因。美國當局認爲有碍衞生，於一九一○年曾頒令禁止進口，美洲市塲，因之告絕，　　查我國綠茶，向以色香味三美著稱，鮮　澄明，是皆基於採製精良，殊非日本產者可得比擬。無如晚近以茶農對於植茶，大都視作副業，且以智識簡陋，墨守舊法，栽培粗放，採摘不時，焙製退化，任使茶質趨劣，甚至作僞攙假，混售善價，茶商亦以維利是圖，不問品質純正與否，儘以「着色」飾潤其美，積久乃成公開秘密，效行各地，初未顧及斷送綠茶海外信譽而自戕生機焉。　　綠茶美銷既告在大减，乃移向新拓之菲洲市塲謀發展，結果亦以「着色」關係，引起彼處重大注意，雖未遭禁絕，而對於「着色色料」則限制極嚴。法國於一九三二年，曾有取締有毒色料茶葉進口之法令頒佈，其他如俄國素爲華茶最大主顧，近年綠茶亦轉向日本採購，凡此種種，莫非由於「着色」釀成，日本諳於時機，對於生產，督勵改進，廣拓茶園，對於輸銷，厲行檢騐，提高品質，由是信譽日隆，且利用檢費之泰半，供對外宣傳推廣之用，結果竟奪華茶在美之偉大市塲，他如印度·錫蘭·爪哇等國，對於栽植之推廣，品質之改良，檢騐之嚴厲，對外之宣傳，亦莫不遺餘力，駿駿焉，互欲爭一日之長，返觀國内，景象昏沉，因循如故，長此以往，不僅綠茶見棄於各方，卽其他茶類，亦將蒙其影響，整個華茶對外貿易，恐有斷絕之虞。　　　　政府有鑒於此，故於上海商品檢騐局成立之翌年，（民國十九年）卽令籌備茶葉檢騐，至二十年春广始檢騐，施行之初，對於「着色」茶出口，卽予禁止，以圖挽救，旋以着色茶之產銷，已有悠久歷史，海外若干緣茶消費國家，亦已養成嗜飲習慣。驟行禁絕，勢必供求失應。因之該局爲體恤商情計，乃呈准實業部，採行逐漸禁絕辦法，指定美國等若干地方，絕對不許輸往，其若菲洲等處，在相當期間尙准運銷，但該項辦法舉行之始，頗有爲綠茶輸出，危其有影響者。二年以來，數量顯見增加。檢政收效，豈豆似之眼光所能料哉。近聞該局政策，有兩種目標：　　（一）制定茶葉着色標凖制定着色標凖綠茶，分送茶葉界，使生產者依據方製，運銷者依據採購，逐年減低色度，期於不久禁絕，使產銷者與飲用者，兩得其宜。　　（二）規定製茶着色色料對於着色色料，各地製茶所用，種類繁多，只求染色美觀，品質是否純正，多不究問，因之流弊多端。據該局搜集市上着色茶習用色料，從事化騐之結果，有砂綠，（含有砒與銅之化合成分）三魚黃（含有銘酸鉛毒質）等二十餘種，在飲用上確有不合衛生之處，乃聘請專家悉心研究，近已發明多種改良替代色料，曾交中外茶商試用，僉認品質優良，逈非習用者可同日而語。其優點爲附着力及被覆力勝過舊用色料，光彩鮮艷，能以少許分量完成着色目的，而茶葉天然色·香·味·亦復不生若何變化。現聞該項色料，業由上海製茶業同業公會，設廠承造，以供各地茶商之應用。據上述兩種辦法，着色既有標凖，色料又復劃一，過渡期間，得此解决，實予茶業界以無限便利。　　今者全國第三次檢政會議，集議於首都，專家濟濟，對於檢政前途，必有發揚光大之研討。竊以爲中國農村經濟若是其衰落，農產品外銷不暢，實爲重大因素，檢政之目的，在求對外貿易之發展，環顧國内工商業亟亟垂危，氣象不景，得未曾有，然則補敝起衰所期望於該會議者，其重要爲何如也。　　夫茶本有其天然色澤，生產者果能採製得法，又何需乎「着色」；「着色」無非僞，何况色料複雜，有碍衛行，國際信用，自必墜落，對外貿易，自必日衰。复以日本·印度·錫蘭等後起之產茶國，乘機侵奪，詆譭勸誘，無所不用其極，自必更使華茶無由立足於國外市塲。是以記者於此，深願第三次會議，應喚起茶業界發惕悟之心，因循猶豫，决非國　商戰中所宜取。務必一方面遵守　　，根據「着色」　凖，採購改良色料，製　運銷。　年减低色度，回復固有天然彩色，使各國消費者根本認識中國緣茶之特長，挽回既失之　　·一方面應努力於栽培，採製·等生產技衛之改進，提高色·香·味·三者之效能，對外廣事宜傳綠茶外銷庶幾有易，則後起之日本·印·錫·等茶業之競爭，未足深懼，此皆有待於此次會議，予以决定根本方針。論動物檢疫  仲英　　歐美各國，對於入口之動物丨如馬牛羊猪狗及野獸等，每經過檢疫機關之檢騐，以防動物病害之傳播。本國商品檢騐機關之成立，已數載於茲，對於此項設施，尙未舉行。深望今日開幕之全國檢政會議，對於此項問題予以深切之注意，得一具體之方案，裨益國計民生，殊匪淺鮮。　　按照各國成規，本國務立卽組織檢疫局，將動物檢騐宜事，設一專科司理。凡船舶入口，如有裝運動物者，船主於靠岸之時，立卽報告海口之動物檢疫長官，關於所裝動物在航行中之經過，後由該長官派獸醫檢騐之。經檢騐合格之動物，先爲隔離，過此隔離期間，方許分運各地。　　隔離所屬特别之建造，有所長司其責。對於隔離時問之長短，視輸出地當時該動物病害之分佈，流行之狀况及輸出前六月該動物身體健康之程度而定。（唯如澳洲等地，在法規上，訂有一定之日期）　　隔離所内之動物，尙須經獸醫詳細之檢查。檢查之項目及方法，視動物而異，如馬騾等，每注意其Dourine(MalodieduCoit)牛則留意其結核病，羊則考察羊毛之狀况。經隔離後之動物，由檢疫局頒給證書，有證書之動物，方得入於内地。　　關於檢疫費用，各國不同。當開辦之始，政府不妨多負經濟上之責任。爲節省開支計。此項機關，可暫由各地商品檢騐局畜產檢騐組辦理，因中國關於獸醫之人才，頗感缺乏也。　　至於動物檢疫法規，可參考各國狀况及本國同情，先由各商品檢騐局獸醫專家個别起草，後由實業部採長去短，集其大成而頒佈之。啟事　　葉子休，何躬行，楊先垿，陳鴻根，勾適生，楚玉，若搴，譚秉文，潘文安，迪先，諸君鑒，四月份稿費已結淸，請自本月八日起至十日止，每日下午兩點至四點鐘，憑條向本館會計處具領爲荷，　　經濟專刋編輯部啓商業新聞　金融　洋拆驟降半數　—辅幣小洋一漲一跌—昨星期日、銀行方面照例休業、收解完全停頓、而市塲中洋拆、亦因交易稀少、驟减半數、計早午市同爲五分、較前日縮小四分、足徵人心向背、非始料所及也、拆票交易、早市轉賬四百二十餘萬、新交易二十餘萬、午市交易四十餘萬、小總會中交易五十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解三千四百餘萬、各路匯欵二十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖三十餘萬、新做出無、輔幣市况、計江南小洋早市爲八百四十一元三角、午市同、較之前日跌小七角、做出交易早市八千角、午市七千五百解、廣東小洋早市爲七百四十二元八角、較之前日午市原已漲上一元、至午市又增加九角、爲七百四十四元七角、結果較前日漲起一元九角、做出交易早市七萬五千角、午市四萬角、銅元仍爲三百三十千文、與前日相同、交易數額三萬四千六百五十串文、合代價洋一萬零五百元、　　早市　　午市洋拆五分五分江南八百四十一元五角間上廣東七百四十五元八角七百四十四元七角拆兌一千五百四十四角四分一千二百四十二角七分銅元五百五十千文同上衣眚五千五百文同上角坯二百四十四文二百四十六文貼水八十五文八十四文上月份存息議决　　查上月份（四月份）洋拆、每天最高額不及一角、最低額亦未至白借、大都在四五分或二三分之間、故全月統計僅一元二角左右、仍不到二元之固定價格、曾誌前報、茲錢業公會於二日常會議决、在息案仍照舊額、定爲二元九五扣、欠息則照四元半坐盤遞加之、如是則最高價不過十元零五角而已、證劵　小進退下之上週公債　丨漲跌之數不過三五角丨上週四月三十日至五月五日、華商證卷交易所、市况在自然狀態中、逐漸趨下、前週國際空氣、由嚴重而趨於和緩、日本態度、表面雖似軟化、根本政策、毫未轉變不過轉換其語調、實爲糖面之毒藥、市塲人心、初則因時局轉定、頗有漲風、惟以外交形勢、愈趨複雜、市氣乃有一蹶不振之象、大戶空頭不補、套頭交易减少、銀拆增高、銀根漸緊、前途或尙有劇變、查五號之賣出、卽前月所收之貨、故本月份多頭、恐不能佔優勢、鑒於連跌之後、回風無力、尤當愼防鉅變也、週一因日本態度軟化、國際風雲、頓轉和緩、北帮補進最多、五號則始終賣出、市價回漲半元、卽已覺其不倫、週二消息混沌、大戶賣出、如五號六號及四十三號等始終不懈、惟四號十一·及五十四號等進罝亦極强、結果漲多跌少、週三形勢最佳、以國際之密鑼緊鼓、已告停歇、各帮進胃皆强、市價竟全日趨漲、爲數雖祗六七角、趨勢極爲强硬、週四環境毫無變化五號四十三號抛賣極湧、多頭更有出籠、市况竟又急轉直下、金短跌一元餘之多、於此可知、大戶求售、數額極鉅、週五上午續跌、下稍回、但仍無力、五號四十三號繼續賣出、週六跌勢示减、人心愈趨軟化、市塲謠言隨之而起、市價又小三四角、市價結果漲跌互見、爲數祗三五角而已、成交總數、期現貨共計八千三百四十四萬一千元、茲將其高低漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）債别　最高　最低　較前日　成交數一八關五月三０·００二九·七０漲０·二五一、四００編遺現四０·四０四０·００跌一·五０二０又五月四０·四０三九·七０漲０·０五一五、四五０又六月三九·八０三九·二五０·一五五、二五０裁兵現七三·００—０—·五０一０又五月七三·六０七二·三０跌０·０五四一、一００又六月七三·八０七二·五００·四０三一、八五０一九關現四六·００——漲０·九０一０又五月四五·００四四·三０不動一六、七００又六月四四·五０四三·三０不動一一、四００　一九善五月五０·００四八·九０漲０·五一一、０五０又六月四九·八０四八·二００二０八、四００廿捲五月五０·九０四九·八五跌０·三五二二、二五０又六月五０·二五四九·０００·二五二０、八００廿關五月五０·二五四九·二００·四五二四、九五０又六月四九·五五四八·六００·一０二三、七五０廿統五月五三·０五五二·一０不動四０、二五０又六月五二·五０五一·五０跌０·一０四二、四五０廿鹽現五四·七０五四·四０漲０·八０二０又五月五四·四０五三·二０跌０·一五　六七、九００又六月五三·七０五二·六０不動六二、七００金短現六七·００—漲０·五０一０又五月六六·九０六五·五０跌０·八０三四、二００又六月六七·一五六五·七００·一０五五、六００二二五月六三·九０六二·０００二五四四、七００又六月六三·一０六一·三五０·二五三０正六現六一·二０—漲０·二０一六、三五０又五月六一·二０六０·六五０·二五二、二００又六月六六０·五０五九·五００三０一五、六００九六五月一一·六０一０·一００·五

<p>申報醫藥周刊理想中之中國醫團  宋國賓　　有人以爲理想與事實不同，理想是空的，是不足爲憑的。其實天下的事，都是先有理想，然後才成事實，理想爲事實之母，如果人人能够本着他的理想去做，祇要這個理想是合理的，我想都可成爲事實，所以我這個理想中的中國醫團，并不是没有實現之可能啊！　　現在中國的醫界，可謂分岐已極！同一新醫，而有着若干的派别，同一性質，而有着若干不相統屬的團體，背道而馳的在互相傾軋着，政府呢？在這種情形之下，有些顧彼失此了！甲團體的建議，乙團體是未必贊同的，於是政府有所顧忌，索性不理了！人民呢？對於新醫本無十足的信仰，現在看見醫界的情形，是這樣的不一致，那麽所謂信仰者，格外的打了折扣了！造成這種結果的主因，那無疑的是由於這醫界的不團結。　　傳曰：「釁由内起」又曰：「人必自侮，而後人侮之，」外來的侵略，决不是無因而至的，必也我有可以招來外侮之釁，而後人始乘釁而來。年來國内的醫界，感覺着外來醫藥的侵略，漸漸的覺悟到非抵抗不可了！但是一究外來醫藥所以侵略到中國的原因，除去國人拜外心理而外，無疑的是由於我們内部的不能團結了！　　現在中國的醫界情形是這樣，那末，我理想中的醫團又是那樣呢？　　我的理想醫團，是包羅各派全國唯一的總集團，是包括學術與職業的最大機關。吾們現在所曉得的，中國最大的醫團共有三個，中華醫學會與中華民國醫藥學會是關於學術方面的，全國醫師聯合會是關於職業方面的。我們又曉得的，中國的醫派有英美德日之分，中華醫學會是以英美派爲中心，中華民國醫藥學會，是以德日派爲中心，而全國醫師聯合會呢？在組織之初，雖有包羅各派之意，而現在實際上一切大權，多操於德日派醫師之手，因爲這個原故，於是各走各的道路，始終未能一致。現在我又來一個理想的醫團了！但是我所理想的，並不是在上面三個以外再添一個第四醫團，而是欲將上面的三個醫團合併爲一個醫團，其性質，是卽在於學術之發揚，又在於職業之保障的。　　假使我的理想的醫團實現了！那麽牠的利益是怎樣呢？現在且分幾點來講　　（一）辦事方面　天下事，分則力散，合則力聚，三個醫團合併爲一，辦事的力量不是集中了麽？不是可以收指揮統一的功效了麽？意見既然消弭了！以前所礙難辦的事。不是可以毫無阻止的去辦麽？力量既然增加了！以前所不能辦的事，不是可以舉重若輕的去辦麽？此其一。　　（二）經濟方面　現在醫界要辦的事眞多，但是十分之六七，往往徒見於空言的建議，而不能成爲事實，最大的原故，就是經濟的力量不充足。假使以三會併爲一會，不啻以三份的經濟力量併爲一份。因爲合併以後，全國醫師有必須加入之勢（理由見下），全國六千醫師，單單會費一項，其數字已足驚人，那麽應做的事務何致因經濟困難而停頓呢？此其二。　　（三）政府方面　因爲我們的意見紛岐，以致政府遇事顧忌，而不能完全實現我們的建議。假使我們完全的大團結！那麽政府還有甚麽顧忌可言呢？此其三　　（四）本身方面　年來我們醫界也曾做了幾件値得稱述的事，如整理新藥的呼聲，取締外籍及本國江湖醫藥醫院等的建議，但是成績終屬寥寥，因爲我們行動不一致原故，外籍的江湖醫生固然無所畏忌，而本國的江湖醫藥，也可以不容於此卽容於彼的以謀他的寄生。這樣，不是徒有空名嗎？如果我們的力量集中了！我們的權威也必隨之而增高了。我們操着莊嚴的無私的權威。政府的發出法令，須得先和我們相商，然後可以推行無阻，各地的醫師，無論中外，須得加入我們的團體，然後職業始有保障，外籍和本國的江湖醫藥，及帝國主義之醫院也可明目張膽的去取縍，不良的醫校，也可以毫無顧忌的干涉，根深蒂固的舊醫也可不打而自倒，這樣的團體，不但是全國惟一的醫事總會，而且等於國家的衛生行政的議會機關了！此其四。　　以上四點，僅其大者，至於人民呢？自然會信仰的，國際上呢？也自然有我們的地位了，這樣努力的奮鬥，精誠的團結，民族復興的責任，難道我們不能担負着嗎？　　這就是我理想的醫團。供獻給年靑及未來的母親們（二）  郭大施　　現在我要提起嬰兒的消化情狀，嘴，食管，胃，小腸頭，小腸和大腸，這些是消化的要道。食物由嘴吮入，待有了牙齒之後，就加上了一番咀嚼的工作，同時由於咀嚼的緣故，涎沫便從涎水核内流出，帮助着消化食物，從嘴裏通過食管便到了胃裏，初生嬰兒胃的筋肉，很是軟弱而且比較大些孩子的胃來得垂直，所以有時食得太飽便會發生嘔吐等事。　　胃裏藴藏着鹽酸及胃酸素等類的帮助消化的液體，如果没有這些液體，消化就失常態，食物在胃裏大約要逗留三小時之久，蛋白質經過了上面說起的胃酸素就大部的消化了。其餘未消化的食物，就到了小腸頭，這裏流着膽汁及腸腴的液體，這些東西，對於澱粉，脂肪，及糖質，均有相當消化的能力。但嬰兒要在出世三四個月後，才有足量的這種液體，所以初生的嬰兒，不能飼以粥類或麵包糊，否則腸胃就要發生變態。　　食物被這些消化液消化之後，就爲腸的四週所吸，流入血液，所賸下不能消化的渣澤便通過大腸而由肛門排泄出來。　　胸哺嬰的大便是黃色有黏性的。人工喂哺嬰兒的大便是較厚而帶黑色，其味較臭。　　我們知道哺乳的方法，祇有兩種，一種是天然的母體胸哺，還有一種就是用人工的瓶哺法。　　每個嬰兒頂好是要用胸哺，因爲這種自然的哺乳方法，不但使微生物不能侵入小兒的體内，同時又可得到母體的温暖的保護。　　母體的奶水，在生理上及化學上的成份和質地，都適合着嬰兒身體搆造所需要的原質。　　人奶較之其他動物的奶，來得容易消化，還有一層，吃人奶可以從母體裏得到一種抵抗疾病的力量。可是有些母親害看肺病，癰，及重性的崩尿症，那末祗能應用人工的哺乳法。　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　胸哺的方法，很是簡單：先把奶頭用滾過的水洗滌乾凈。出世不久的嬰兒，哺乳應該臥着，一待做母親的自己能够離床之後，就用坐着哺乳的方式，把嬰兒抱着，頭靠着手腕，另外的一隻手把奶頭喂給他，用食指撥開小兒的鼻孔，使他便於呼吸。時間至多不得超過二十分鐘。隔十分鐘，必須停歇二三分鐘，把嬰兒抱直起來，這樣可以使嬰兒不致因噫氣而吝入多量的空氣。　　因爲奶房有時會完全没有奶水，所以最緊要是每次哺乳的時候，祗用一個奶房。完全吮乾的奶房，倒容易產生多量的鮮奶，如果嬰兒喂過奶後，奶房有過剩的奶，最好用手或吸乳器，把奶完全擒了出來。假使奶房不能產生奶水，我們要用許多日常所知的方法去補助，如果一切都不生效力，那末祗好應用人工的哺乳法了。　　事實是不能隱瞞的。人工哺乳如果所用的方法不妥當，對於嬰兒是很容易發生危險的。最大的原因就是過量的哺喂同食料配合的不匀，往往在體内醖釀着許多不潔的氣體，使腸腑引起過速的作用，結果便發生瀉痢等症，乳量的多少，和滋養料的配合是依照着嬰兒的年齡及體重而定的。　　有時嬰兒吃奶後啼哭，做母親的便以爲是飢餓的緣故，輕易的再把奶瓶喂給他，這種觀念是絕對錯誤的。就是我們看見嬰兒很快樂地把第二瓶吮完，可是不久這些小寳貝的腸胃就會發生異狀的。有時雖然飲料的配合是很凖確，可是還有的錯誤就是太冷或太熱。更要注意奶頭的小孔不可過大。嬰兒吃奶過快，容易噎着食管同時胃裏也不能容受過速的食物。　　下面表例着嬰兒所需要的食物，這是屢經試騐，成份和化合都很凖確的：「加路力」（Calores）註一計算法：一格萊姆(igramm)的蛋白有四個「加路力」一格萊姆　的脂肪有　九個加路力一格萊姆　的糖　有　四個加路力　　用加路力計算法來額定嬰兒每天所消耗的食料的數量是較妥當的，第一個月的嬰孩，體重每一千公斤（二·二磅）每日須消耗一百至一百十加路力的食料。以後，需要八十至九十加路力。　　總之嬰兒每日所消耗食料的重量須合本身體重的六分之一。　　至於滋養料的成份是依照着嬰兒的年齡而定的：第一個月　牛奶佔三分之一，第二個月　牛奶佔半數，第三個月　完全牛奶。　　每百公斤（三·五盎斯）的滋養料，要加一茶匙的糖。哺乳要有凖確的時間，頂好每天能分五次。過了三個月，中午的一次，可以取消，粥類就可以喂給嬰兒了。過了第四個月，再可廢掉另外的一次哺乳，中午的一餐，用蔬茶來代替。　　在第三個月的下半月裏，橘子汁及其他的菓子汁，含有多量的維太命，就能給小兒在吃過了粥再吃。　　第五個月後，葡萄汁，　碎的香蕉及其他蒸熟的水菓，都可以吃了。</p>

<p>什麽呌做催生針？（下）  丁名全　　　效用更其充足的時候，是把上述兩種藥前後並用，别的藥劑依催生眞正的意義，那可以講很少的，我們在此也不必細述。　　（二）何時可用催生針　　我們現在要談的第二個問題，是何時可以用催生針？用的份量是多少？用了以後是否可以再用？　　一，在姙娠時：用在此時乃是眞正催生，但是牠的效用非常不一定，大多是離預算生產的日子愈近，所發生的效力愈大，至於我們在此用的時候，以姙娠過期，姙娠期内胞囊破裂，胎兒在姙娠中期死亡，或則因爲姙娠胎氣太重，毋體無能担負，或則在一種情形之下（骨盤過小）本來是要剖腹的，而又因别種情形（肺管炎）不能的時候，我們都可以用此種方法，以便生產早期完結，而保母體健全。　　方法：產婦早晨七時服二食匙草麻子油，後熱水洗浴（攝氏四十度）十至十五分鐘，九點鐘時用熱水（攝氏三十五至三十七度）灌腸，十時令服金鷄納霜零點二，以後每半小時一包内零點一或則注射該藥於肌肉内金鷄納霜，注射是很痛的，所以一定要注入肌肉最好注射於臀部内。）　　有時亦可將此藥與强心劑混合注射，或使内服，如此雖有心臟或循環器衰弱之現象，同時可以去了，對於胎兒亦不致有氣窒之碍，兩種混合劑中以CardiazolCbinin爲最佳，我們大半大開始注射半西西（等於十分之二五金鷄納霜及十分之一Cardiazal該混合劑，以後每半小時或一小時四分之一西西，及至子宮口開放如銀元大時，醫者可繼續注射垂腦腺後葉汁，頂好是與胸下　混合之。　　Tbymophysin注射十分之二西西五次於三十至四十五分或則十分之三西西三次於此時候内於肌肉内，多則不可，如無此，混合劑，那醫者可用純粹的垂腦腺後葉汁，或則用該汁中之專門收縮子宮肌肉者（現在垂腦腺後葉汁已依其作用之各異分爲兩種，一種是專門收縮子宮的，一種是增高血壓力的）其中最佳者爲Ofasthin醫者可以在三十至四十五分鐘内注射十分之二西西，計共五次（注意此處之一西西不是依重量爲標凖，此處是以單位爲標凖Orasthin二種，一種是輕的，一西西有三單位，一種重者有十單位，我們此地是用輕者，所以每十分之二西西等於十分之六單位，）但在二十四小時内不可過六單位以上，如用此量而仍無效，醫者當另設法，，或則過二至八日再爲之（如姙娠過期，待數日是無妨）　　二、生產時：　　甲，開口期：在開口期陣痛衰弱時，（如老年初產，子宮肌肉太弛，子宮肌肉太幼稚，多產者子宮無收縮力，子宮發炎，胎胞早破），可以用此藥，但不如娩出期那樣有效，並且有時能發生痙陣，反使生產時期延長，所以我們在此時用催生劑還是要小心，份量千萬不可大重，最好是金雞納霜與Thymophysin並用，那末我們用的份量還可减輕而效力却仍甚大方法：我們對於開口期陣痛弱者，開始卽與金雞納霜零點壹，以後每半小時一包（十分之一克），同時再注射半至一單位垂腦腺後葉汁，也可以半小時一針，如此不久便有很好的陣痛產生。　　不過我們在胎胞未破以前，上述兩種藥劑都不給的，因爲母子均無需要故也，若是在此種情形之下，生產仍不前進，而產婦有疲乏現像，那醫者可用嗎啡或其他安眠藥與之，使之休息，如此經過一定時間後，產婦及子宮復得新力，陣痛反能轉强，生產便有待矣。　　乙，娩出期：在此時，我們用此藥最爲合宜，尤其在離生產時期愈近，其希望愈大，我們在此時用催生劑，以垂腦腺後葉爲主，此時用此藥，可以除去不少無謂之手術，可以减輕不少母子之死亡率，我們在此時，用此樂可以比較大膽，所以用的份量，是比上述加多，並且此處所得的效果比上述的效果來得大，我們此地不用金雞納霜了，因其作用够不到，用Ｔhymophysin雖然仍有，但是總没有垂腦腺後葉汁來得好，我們所用的方法大都如下：　　我們所用的藥劑是濃的居多，如PitnitrinPitnitaminOrasthinStrong等，所用的份量總是在五單位以上。　　丙，後產期（胎盤未落的），　　垂腦腺後葉汁在此的功效更大，以前有很多不落下的胎盤是用手去剝取的，自從此藥發明後，用手取胎盤之法，要减少得多了，常然毋體中毒的危險也就此减輕。　　我們對於此種胎盤不下的現像，非特可以肌肉注射重量的垂腦腺後葉汁，有時亦可用靜脈注射之（小心，不可太快）。　　用催生針第三個問題，是問此藥是否可以用在個個產婦身上？及用了以後是否無危險的？　　（三）無論何種藥，當然只有醫者識其藥性者始可用之·用催生針亦然，並不是個個產婦是可用的，但是我們要知道用催生針後所發生的問題多數不是不可用，或藥劑不好，大半却是醫者用得不得其時，或則份量過多之故，因此危險叢生，反而不美。　　所以我們應當注意產婦的現像如何，而施用之。　　譬如下述各種病症，我們是要忌用催生針。　　一，凡曾剖過子宮者（如皇切，子宮肉瘤式曾破裂過之子宮，）現在不可用此藥，因爲有復破裂之危險，　　二，子宮頸痙，此時若用催生針，則易使子宮發痙而有破裂之危，如醫者將此藥與麻醉藥劑互相並用，則可保無危，　　三，母體循環器失調，如血壓力增高等，最好不用垂腦腺後葉汁，因此藥可以增加血壓故也，若是必須用的，如遇子癎病，心臟血管硬化、慢性腎臟炎，那末可以專門收縮子宮肌之垂腦腺後部Orasthin汁，　　四，如其不能自動生產（由產道產出者，）不可用垂腦腺後部汁（如遇骨盤第三或四度狹小，水頭，橫體位，下顎向後折之面體位，子宮有瘤，子宮將破裂時，諸此種，均不可用催生劑。　　五陣痛整齊時，絕對不可用垂腦化後部汁，但是普通却用之者甚多，因此而發生危險茲大。　　六，初產婦子宮口尙有開大時，不可用垂腦腺後部汁。　　七，胎兒在有氣窒之時，醫者亦不可用垂腦腺後部汁，必要時少用些，在娩出期（頭將產出時）可以用之，惟用後無效，則當施手術取出之，　　上述各種，都在禁忌之例，然而不是個個女子有此現像者不能用此藥，有者仍可用，須候醫者之機警如何。兒童近視之預防（下）  郭人驥　　欲令其姿勢佳良。須令其桌椅之高低。有適當之距離。得以正面視書爲必要。至若臥時讀書。寫字。均爲最恶之習慣。　　又因服裝不良。壓迫頸部。以致頭部發起充血。亦可視爲近視之原因。衣服以寛大爲良。又在熱度過强之煖爐火盆間工作者。頭部發生充血。亦爲不良　　（三）獎勵戶外運動。　　高度近視以虚弱之人爲多。又疾病　　　肺結核淺說（四）  胡嘉言　　肺結核傅染的途徑，除上面提出的接觸傳染外，還有幾種其他的途徑呢？這幾種發現，我們對於過去科學醫的工作，當然是不能不感謝的。我現在且一一的分述在下面：　　（一）空氣吸入。關於此種途徑，普通又可分爲二種情形；第一種呌做小滴傳染，第二種呌做吸入傳染，又名塵埃傳染。怎樣呌小滴傳染呢？我們要曉得，尋常病人的結核菌，大多數是在痰裏的，（排泄物像糞便裏面也是有的）。如果此肺結核病人，在咳嗽，打噴嚔，或談話的時候，他的喀痰，是含有結核菌無疑的，這種痰於是變成細小泡沬，噴散到空中去了。假使在這個時候，有一位接近病人的人吸氣，這種傳染於是就成功了。這就是小滴傳染。但尋常新鮮濕潤的喀痰，是不容易散到空中去的，所以這樣的傳染危險，比較還少。乾燥的痰就不然了，他是很容易飛散到空中去的，他的毒性，在三個月當中，都不會消失的；這種痰屑，在半空中塵埃合併，無論人類或動物，祇須吸進去，就會發生肺核的。這一條途徑，就是上面所說的吸入傳染了。　　（二）食物的傳染。這一種經過，大半是發生腸結核的，和肺部當然是没有直接關係的。此中最大的原因，據歐洲學者的公論，保飲牛乳的關係。這種情形，大半係小孩羅其害，大人可就少了。假使想避免這種傳染危險，頂要緊的，就是普通當作滋養品牛孔，應該煮沸五分至十分鐘後，方可服入的。這一種條件，是决不可忽視的。在過去的我國，飲牛乳還没有成爲尋常習慣，這類的事實，當然是比較少一點的。但是這樣的傳染危險，我想也是大家不可不知的。　　（三）皮膚創傷。這一種原因，大半係和患結核病的動物太接近的關係，假使皮膚一有了損傷，那就狠容易發生皮膚結核病的。也有因此而侵犯淋巴管，致患淋巴腺結核的。　　衰弱之時。有謂其近視之度顯呈進步者。瑞典某校於授課之中間。奬勵其戶外運動獲。有近視减少之經騐。故戶外運動有效於近視之豫防。甚爲明瞭。且也。工作之時。時時加以變更爲必要。蓋施行近業於一定時間之後。須有一定時間出外運動。其對於身體之健康與眼。均有良好之影嚮者也。　　（四）須戴適當之眼鏡。御眼鏡。則近視程度增進。此昔日之思想也。今日已知其謬誤。依多數之實騐而確定之矣。卽豫防近視之進行。以御適度之眼鏡爲最良之方法。蓋近視之人。不御眼鏡。自然逼近書籍而閱讀。終至近視之度益加增進。若令戴適宜之眼鏡。必能在正當之距離閱讀矣。　　規定眼鏡之度數。須有專門的智識。必當就眼科醫之診察。依其處方。而作成眼鏡。始可。　　（五）注意其遺傳關係。其伶親患近視者。其子亦易罹近視。統計上。已甚明瞭德國之學者。曾調查某部落之居民。雙親之一方有强近視者。則其子約有半數之近視。若雙視俱患强度近視。其子悉皆近視。故近視之人。敎育其子之時。更宜勵行上述之預防方法爲必要。眼鏡之注意　　眼鏡以大者爲宜。然過大則外觀不雅。且對於目。亦有不便。須在種種條件之下。考慮之。要以選用其相當大者爲宜。戴眼鏡之方法。自前方觀之。眼之瞳孔。宜在鏡片之中央。（稍在上方）。自側方見之。鏡片稍傾於前方。務使睫毛勾觸鏡片。而近眼爲良。切勿以手指獨鏡片。且時時以皮製品拭之爲必要　　眼鏡之度。有新舊兩種之稱呼。新式者稱爲第奥必妥（Dioptorie）（新度）。舊式者稱爲舊度。次表爲新舊兩度之比較對照。　　五五　五　○○七六三○··舊式（度）八四二一一一八六五五四四　　　　　＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝新式（第奥五○五五三四五六七八九○）必妥）（Dioptorie·　·　·　一Dioptorie○一一二（完）介紹新著　（二）外科各論　　我國新醫刋物，固已數見不鮮矣，然較之文哲諸籍之汗牛充棟，直如滄海之一粟，北平大學醫學院敎授劉兆霖先生，主敎外科已近十載，深感此類漢文專書異常需要，爰參考東西文獻，擇其精髓，益以本身之經騐，闡明理論及治療志在簡而不略，詳而不冗，其中插圖，大多取材於本國患者，卽此一端，已開我國新醫書籍之新紀元，書分上下兩卷，上卷約二十萬言，插圖二百九十二幅，内容分頭部外科，頸部外科，胸部外科，脊柱脊髓及骨盆外科，植物生神經外科等篇，下卷都三十餘萬言，插圖五百餘幅，内容分腹部外科，上肢外科及下肢外科等篇，行文流暢，叙述精詳，對於各種手術，均附有精美插圖，讀者按圖素解，一目瞭然，無扦格不入之弊，誠我國空前之醫學名著也，上卷現已出版，定價實洋五元，下卷現售預約，定價六元，預約期本年月三十日截止，六月一日出書，發行者北平醫刋社，經售處上海北京路二六六號（中内信托大樓）五定公司醫藥書報部。中藥之製劑備考（三）（三續）  林鴻藻第五節粉碎Comminution　　粉碎者。乃使藥物爲粉末或團塊成顆粒之方法也。製劑上配製酊酏膏浸。欲其有效成分。易於浸出或溶解。或直接以藥物之粉末爲散劑。而供治療之用時。必須將藥物藉機械之力。使之粉碎後。始可操作自如。否則卽以原形藥物應用。必多窒礙。蓋如此接觸面積少。而作用遲緩。治療上又不便取用。倘經粉碎。其面積增大。而作用亦因之增速。取用亦殊便利。例以固形明礬十公分。溶於一百公撮之水内。再以同量粉碎之明礬。溶於同量水中。則二者之溶解。後者當較速於前者。其理甚明。又在治療時。需要甘草。吾人倘與以莖狀甘草。則患者見其粗笨。自當厭棄之。藥物常因其性質之不同。而粉碎方法亦隨之而異。故有剉截。摀碎。研磨等種種方法。茲分述於後。　　剉截法。RaspingandCutting凡草根皮葉。在製劑上不論其爲細粉或粗末。須先剉截。然後可進行其他操作。如舊式藥店之截飲片然。置諸截藥刀上。截成片狀或薄屑。此種截藥刀。有單柄者及雙柄者之分。單柄者。卽刀之首端。以活軸固定於木盤之上。操作時。右手揑刀柄。左手持藥物。平刀口處。有橫鐵。爲擱置藥物之用。藥物置妥。右手按下。刀因槓桿作用。卽呈其效用。如是漸送漸按。則藥物卽成所需之片塊。雙柄者功用與單柄同。唯刀有二柄。形如扇狀。刀背有厚木板。備繋此刀。藥物置刀下。雙柄旋以重力。藥物卽可切爲碎片。普通有此二者。卽可供用。在大量製劑時。可用旋轉切碎器。Ro

<p>自由談	紐約通信  羅皚嵐　第三封兩天不同的「時」記烈文兄：　　前天晚上從城外回來，走到寓所門口時，才記起淸晨出門忘了帶鑰匙。那時已很晚了，房東太太全家都上床睡了，我不便按鈴去驚動她們，便在附近一百二十四街的五百一十五號公庽臨時開了一個房間。　　提起五百一十五號，我想有不少在紐約住過的中國同學會記得這個地方，管房子的是一個猶太人，以前見了每　個中國同學，總是問：「要不要房間？我有一間頂好的房子等着你來住。」自從與一位Ｘ君因珸衝突，Ｘ駡他應該給希特來虐殺以後，他對中國同學便不如以前那樣客氣了，雖然那裏仍居了不少的中國學生，雜碎館和洗衣館的華僑，菲烈濱人，及一些正式或非正式的白妓。　　「我的朋友」○君益稱那地方爲脂粉地獄，可見牠的名譽並不佳妙，但我總以爲牠比煤油大王捐資建築的所謂大同公庽（IulernationlHouse）要好一點，至少不會使你碰見許多僞君子，一些你並不需要的假同情者，和一羣了見了頭痛的美國特產老太婆。　　我那晚的運氣不好，房間裏有臭蟲，咬得我睡不着。我索性起床開了燈，抽了一回烟，仍是睡不着。我無可奈何地，在房内各處搜尋，想找一本書或幾頁報紙來閱讀。我近來養成了一種壞習慣，睡覺前非找點東西閱讀，簡直不能入夢。那晚給臭蟲一咬，更不能睡了。　　無意中我忽壁角裏找到一本記事本，這種本子原是於在案頭的，和案頭日曆差不多，不過上面印着時間，是給事務忙碌的人預記每天每一點鐘的約會的。上面滿寫着中國字，大約是一位曾住過這房的中國同學留下的，他没有用牠來記約會，却在上面寫他每天的時」記。　　這「時」記是按着時間記的，寫得很簡單，雖然提到的人名中也有我所認識的，但我至今仍猜不出這「時」記的主翁是誰。我現在抄了兩天不同的「時」記在下面，一個是星期五，一個是星期六，前者代表平常日子的生活，後者代表假期的生活，國人從這兩天的「時」記中，也許可略窺留學生生活之一斑，雖然我應在這兒聲明，牠們並不足代表一切留學生的生活。　　星期五上午　　八時起床，浴室爲隔壁」女人佔用，等了半點鐘她方出來，這種人應該槍斃。　　九時在房烘了點叶司麵包吃了。出門去哥大中文圖書館看報，遇○女士也在彼，她帶着大眼鏡，三分像人，七分像鬼，却自命風流，偏有許多中國學生追她，眞不懂。也許與經濟學上的供求律有關。　　十時上ＸＸ學史課。偶窺隣座某中國同學課本，上滿注中文細字，因憶及兒時初讀英文情形。　　十一時上ＸＸ學課。十二在咖啡店午餐。侍女的微笑很動人。（未完）生趣  度　　「生活外，還應該有點「生趣」，這才感覺到生命之意味」。！！好像豈明先生說過這幾句話，這可算名言。　　凡偉大的人物，没有不愛好生命的吧，有許多人類的憎恨者，頽廢者，彷彿厭惡生命了，怠於人世了，其原由，大概也還是愛人類。唯其愛之切，所以恨之深。許多人憧憬於覩史多天，超人，正是發露着生命更高華之典型，爲斯世的人們設敎。佛門戒殺，慈善及於蟲魚，蟲魚的生命尙且不能毁傷，何况人類呢？　　及至生存競爭激烈，强弱懸殊，於是優勝劣敗，成了自然的趨勢。但優劣的分際，仍以爲生命與否爲轉移。和平然後强大，慈悲然後勇武，能充其眞强大勇武的力量，然後能謀優越的生存。反之，狠毒，殘忍，好殺，没有强大的理由，圖生存也覺生路有限。離開爲生命的主旨，生在世上幹什麽呢？　　然則生活之中，「生趣」最重了。大家覺得生在世上有味，然後能保持人與人間的和平。及至「生趣」索然，覺得「不如無生」了，那狀態便非常可怕。現代人物一輩一輩聰明。生活力只見其强烈，倘若樂生之情盡失，豈不是人人皆可抽刃而起了呢？　　但看通常毁壞生命者，社會上的罪犯，並非盡因生活困苦所致，大半還是無生趣，無聊。譬如蛾撲火并非圖生存，狗咬人并不因飢餓。而通常在社會上成功者，在事業上有造就者，倒是生趣盎然，少有仇敵，爲大衆所親附，也爲大衆謀幸福。釋迦渺渺茫茫說敎，並不使人得物質上的温飽，而人類至今崇拜他，因爲他是爲生命，爲人類的生存故。　　好像是宋儒有這種詩句吧：「綠滿階前草不除」。眼前頗見無限的生機，並不見其迂腐。孟重「恒心」，孔老先生聽到曾子講「浴乎沂，風乎舞雲，諒而歸」　便也飄飄然道：「吾與點也」！！正是道道理。黎明頌  葉蒼岑　　誰說這正是無邊的黑夜？我却覺得天已快要黎明。聽遠處不是已有了鷄呌，它正把入夢的人們喚醒。　　你辛勞而且沈默的人們啊，飽受了漫漫長夜的壓抑；而現在却是醒來的時候了，你們可曾在黑暗中驚起？　　我隱隱地聽到你們的傳呼，不住地顫動你們的手臂—你們的手臂直指天空，你們的傳呼撼動了大地！　　你們的傳呼撼動了大地，這總是宇宙的一曲新聲，它那樣沉潛却那樣有力，一不由地獻上我滿腔的熱情！　　那憧憧的夜影終須隠避天空裏要放出金色光明：聽篇頭烏雀就開始啁啾，而靑曦也要在天邊輝映。「懷古」與「取材於古」  穆木天　　我們對於一個問題，必須加以詳細的分析。缺乏詳細的分析，不但可以犯籠統的毛病，而且有時更易墜入很大的錯誤。　　在西歐文學史上的浪漫主義時代，有一種傾向，呌做「中世主義」（Medievisme）對於這種「中世主義」，好多人以爲是很簡單，就是懷戀中世，和取材於中世。然而，經過精細的分析，我們就會知道其實并不是那麽簡單。懷戀中世，同取材於中世，並不是一致的東西。而在所謂「中世主義」之中，是有着相背馳的兩種不同的傾向。事實是證據。文學史供給了我們以正確的事實。　　仔細分析，我們可以尋得出一個眞實的認識來。在英國文學史中，同是取材於中世，可是有瓦爾浦爾（Waipole）和施高塔（Scott）等的「噶瑟克小說」，更有查鐵敦（Chatterton）的詩歌。在一方，是描寫封建諸侯的城塞，而在他方，則是描寫中世的新興都市。在法國文學中亦然雖同是取材中世，可是有擁護基督敎的沙陀卜里昻(Chateaubriand)更有反對中世敎會的雖果(Hugo)。如果把沙陀卜里昻的「殉敎者」(LesMartyrs)和兩果的「黎聖母院」(NotreDamedeparis比較一下，就可以知道。因爲作爱的出身不同，環境各異，所以他們的磿史觀也不不免互相背馳了。　　同是取材中世，可是瓦爾浦爾，施高塔，沙陀卜里昻，是懷戀中世的封建的貴族的世界，而雨果諸人則是利用着中世的歷史的題料制成作品，以破壞封建的遺留，以反對封建。取材於中世和懷戀中世之不同，由此可知，只施有　　　「翰海」  殊　　五三　尺牘，最可珍貴的，是小修的一部分，如寄侄悼中郎云：「存亡徂遷，悠忽易歲惟夜夜入夢，有若平生耳。海内每一知已既去，復何心世緣？」至性至情，在兩三語中，竟抒寫無遺，讀之不禁悽然。寄夏道甫云：「山中淸寂，畫着夾衣，夜藍木綿被。樹較前益深泉更響。小菴收拾已完，明窓凈几，掃地焚香讀書，差有李秃翁當日風味。」寄弟云：「山中已有一亭，次每作屋。晨起，閱藏經數卷，倦卽坐亭上，看西山一帶堆藍，天然一幅米家墨氣！午後閒走乳窟聽泉，精神日以爽健，百病不生。三月初間，花鳥更新奇，來往數日，烟靈供養，受用不盡。」風姿飄酒，文筆淸俊，此種尺牘，在明人中，殊不易得，可謂上品。伯修尺牘，所收亦多可牘的，如云：「十年夢想虎邱茶，如想高人韻士。千里寄至，發瓶喜躍，恰如故人萬里歸來，不足方此愉快。」如「明年春杪，兄幸早發，弟煮雨前茶於小竹林候兄。」雖是應酬之作，但片言隻語，别有風韻，逈非一般應酬文章所可比者。而報陶石　所云：「岑寂中，讀家弟諸刻，如籠中　鵒，忽聞林間鳴喚之音，恨不卽掣條裂鎖，與之偕飛，」尤足想見兄弟之情。中郎尺牘，最易尋訪，我所藏之錢伯敬四十卷全集本，較之所藏梨雲館本雖多，然仍不免有遺落。本書所收中郎尺牘不少，無　校閱，不知是否仍有佚稿寄。社中兄弟云：「吾兄弟俱老矣！　以時自娱。世事萬端，皆不足介意。所謂自娱者，非世俗之樂。但胸中曠然無一物，卽天壤之内，山川，草木，虫魚之類，皆足供吾家樂事也。」此信極可想見中郎晚年心懷，與其對人間世的幻滅，正不啻今之苦雨翁之自白。可惜今非明世，苦雨翁硬要把自己拉回明朝，事實上是辦不到了，無怪五十自壽詩出，劉大杰雖「悽然淚下，」而諸小子，仍不免鳴鼓而攻矣。與陶周望云：「徐文長老年詩文，幸爲索出，但恐一旦入醋婦酒媪之手，則二百年雲山，便覺冷落，此非細事。」當時中郎搜集文長文字的苦心，與夫古籍不時遭受之厄運，於此可見之。送行  黑嬰　　休問這旅程多遠；走罷，趁此旭日東昇的時候。　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ踏着堅實的脚步的跋涉的征人呵！且聽這句叮嚀吧：向前走，莫回頭！　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ走能罷！忘却這野味的戀罷！此後就在新的途上邁步；永遠作光明的尋求！高塔，沙陀卜里昻諸人，是懷戀中世。他們的没落的心情使他們「懷古」。　　自然，無論是沙陀卜里昻，是雨果，都是對「當前再變」表示着不滿的。可是因爲環境不同之故，他們的不滿取了背道而馳的傾向。同是取材於古，可是，一方面在「懷古」，而另一方面則在反古。　　在中國現在，好像呈出了類似的現象，「取材於古」的作品是一天天地多起來似的。可是，要注意的是　在那些作品中，是包括着相反的，相背馳的傾向，我們是不能一概地稱之爲進步的或退步的。譬如看見某一作家「取材於古」時，我們須將其作品加以細密的分析，然後確定其退步的要素和進步的要素。不然，結論就會是「說法未免太籠統一點」了。　　現在還是就事實論事實。譬如「三個叛逆的女性」罷，它雖然是「取材於古」，可是作者的目的在於反封建，而不是在於懷戀古代的封建社會。雖然，「三個叛逆的女性」，有許多點値得批判，有作者的「還我自然」的盧梭主義的反映，可是决不是封建的追懷。而陳夢家的「西山野火」呢，則不然。「西山野火」中，表示着詩人的「感慨，」自無疑義，可是，是什麽樣性質的「感慨」呢，則是可以考究的了。在「西山野火」中含有着多多少少的隘狹的人道主義的成分，是不能被否定的，可是，其中的「懷古」，是懷戀着貴族世界，是懷戀着武士英雄，那種對於「霍嫖姚六七次橫掃塞北的威風」之懷戀，已反映出懷戀封建貴族世界之唐吉歌德的心理，是更不能被否定的。我們讀某一诗人的某一作品時，須把它同他的其他作品連繋起來作一個考查，從某一首詩里斷章取義是不足以得到正確的認識。一言以蔽之，就是詩人陳夢家感至在古代是霍嫖姚「六七次橫掃過塞北」，而現在呢則是無人「舉起烽火」了。可是我們是不還需要封建英雄給我們舉烽火呢？救國，我以爲是民衆的事體。「一二八」不是給我們以好多的經騐了麽？「西山野火」的客觀的効果，只會引起傳統主義封建主義之復活。同是「取材於古」，但是，「三個叛逆的女性」同「西山野火」是表示着兩個不同的傾向的。　　杜甫在「前出塞」中，說「殺人亦有限，立國自有疆。苟能制侵陵，豈在多殺傷」。只要我們能把侵略者驅逐出境，似乎也不必「六七次橫掃過塞北一的。我們只有想當定的辦法，「懷古」似乎也没什麽必要。「取材於古」，自然非無意義。如「太平天國」「牙片戰爭」等等的題材，都可以適當地任我們採取。適當地去制成主題，是必要的。　　最後，我一一再當定地說，對於一個作品之認識，是不能斷章取義地作片面的，含混的分析。如果把雨果所寫的，中世同沙陀卜里昻所寫的中世，看成一樣的話，那就「未免太籠統」了。其結果，將成爲是非莫辨。這「類的事體，是須時時審謹處之的。維尼的詩「角笛」（lecor）諸作，同雨果的「諸世紀的傳統」雖同同取材於歷史，然而是逈然不同的東西。山舖票（三）  唐錫如　　不要看了，不要看了，一股勁地拼命邁開脚步往人行道上跨過去。「撞吓！……」眞的你不撞那兒會着，？「就買就中！」猶豫是要不得的。萬這張頭奬，是（爲了自已遲疑一下，就給旁人先一步買了去呢？大丈夫，男子漢，說做就做！······左脚剛跨到茘枝擔旁邊，背後一陣發狂般的爆竹聲捲了過來。　坐在風火燈旁邊的賣茘枝的，轉過去和身邊賣菉荳沙的說：「頭彩又是興隆賣出的！」背後有個人跑過來，也喊：「山舖票的頭彩又是興隆中的！」「頭彩！……又……又是！……」阿發一個轉身，一口氣便跑了回去。店面前擁了一大堆人，有瞧熱閙的，有給爆竹鼓勵了，像阿發一般跑來買獎券的，也有是來看上次圈的字有没有中的。地上全是爆竹的碎紙。空氣　還　漫着濃重的火藥氣味。店門口貼上一張紅紙，漿糊濕漉濃的直滲過紙面來：「本店連中二次頭彩誌喜。」阿發擠進店裏，圈了十個字，交了兩角錢，把收據懷了，再擠出人堆。這纔像是做完了件牽延　許久的，繁難的大事，他的心覺到異樣的舒泰，又像恰纔還做錯了什麽，這件事要不是像剛纔那麽遽的做就，顯然他可以做得更加完善許多的。阿發就是一路懷了這種又是喜悅，又有些懊喪的那種混雜的感覺，跑到蠔殼街去睡覺的。他連圈的是那幾個字都没有曉得。　　（二）一轉到蠔殼街，便　突然暗了下來，靜了下來。這兒没有霓虹的燈光，没有接連不斷的汽車，没有咖喊的呌賣，没有潮水似的人頭。……這見的街燈，也像比别地的暗許多。騎樓底下全是苦力們的縱橫的身影。　　阿發把圍在腰上的汗布，往較空的地方一攤，就在别人的泥脚邊橫了下來。隔幾條街還很熱閙。他躺在水門汀上，可以看到東邊一列屋背後像是着，火，電燈光映紅了半個天，市囂像是蚊子在呌，一陣抑了下去，一陣又揚了起來。還有什麽地方的無綫電在大聲的唱戲，眞是想睡都睡不熟。要是下次頭奬給他阿發中了怎麽辦？他在問自己。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言水鳥外交  姑射　　最近日使有吉歸國，向廣田外相報告對華外交，主張「水鳥外交」。水鳥外交者，卽「外觀看來，態度悠然，其實則趾爪在水，異常忙碌，此卽外觀以不卽不離之態度，而自側面頻繁交涉之意」也。最近三年來日本之對華外交，可謂是「鐵鳥外交」，就是他對中國的種種要求，都是在鐵鳥丨飛機丨威迫之下成就的。而現在則又主張「水鳥外交」。變化多端，眞可謂極盡外交之能事了。　　有吉的主張水鳥外交，其意義是怎麽樣呢？這是很有趣的問題。照有吉的解釋，卽「外觀悠然，趾爪潛動」之意（見上文）。原來所謂「外觀悠然」者，卽在表面上不立刻卽行强迫中國承認「滿洲國」；而「趾爪潛動」者，卽暗底裏用盡種種方法，屈服中國，强迫中國，使之更進一步，向日本帝國主義公開的或秘密的澈底的投降。這便是有吉主張水鳥外交的眞意。　　日本的對華外交，一向是以强硬著名的。這强硬的程度，至前年以來，而達到空前未有的深化。這時不是外交，而簡直是戰爭了。而最近有吉却又主張水鳥外交，要外觀悠然，趾爪潛動的在暗中活動。這却是爲的什麽？原來，三年來日本對華外交政策的結果，中國方面老早不成問題了；現在所尙成爲問題的，就是英美各國，能不能允許日本獨呑中國，最少限度是先呑華北一半。於是，跟着日本對華外交的勝利，就非正式的發布了外務省有名的宣言。這宣言實際意義是日本用來試探英美各國，能不能獨呑中國的，及其反響如何。宣言公布的結果，英美的回答，是不答應。日本知道這條道路很有點妨碍，與其明顯的獨呑中國，不如暗中的來進行分割中國罷。於是，就宣布了水鳥外交。水鳥外交就是日本要在不甚明顯的塲合下，進行分割中國。而這分割中國的企圖，在中國方面已經一無障礙，所以現在不必再需「鐵鳥」，而只須「趾爪潛動」。　　不僅如此，有吉的水烏外交，一方面還要對英對美活動。就是，要與英美暗中商量，怎樣來平均分配中國。以往三年日本的對華軍事行動，雖深招英美各國之不滿，然日本若能隨風轉舵，適可而止，在相當限度内，尊重英美在華權利，則英美各國，亦未嘗不願「移尊就教」。若再能進一步而與英美討論怎樣瓜分中國，則英美各國，「尤所歡迎」。英美所希望者，原也不過是中國之某一塊土地耳，只要權利平均，大家本可太平無事。於是，水鳥外交，就十分需要了。水鳥外交，就其對英對美之意義言，就是要與英美各國疏通，仔細商量，怎樣來平均分割中國丨自然，日本是要取得其大部份。如此，便可免得大家吵嘴，「東亞和平」，爲之「擾亂」。這又是有吉水鳥外交之又一義。　　不問是「鐵鳥外交」也好，「水鳥外交」也好；對華也好，對英對美也好，總之，現在是只有日本在說話。目前的東亞，就是整個放在日本支配之下；而目前的東亞政局，就是日本在與英美各國公開的討論支配中國。而中國呢？竟是十十足足做了日本帝國主義手裏的一個「掌中玩物」！我們眞不相信，在二十世紀的現在，還會看到這曠古未有的慘局！唯命論在中國  馬嬰　　記得前年當局曾經發過一道命令，嚴厲取縍卜卦算命看相測字……等妖言惑衆的職業；一般做這種生活的人，一着了慌便也來個時髦的玩意兒——聯名請願。這一齣瞎子閙店的劇本，不料竟博得當局的同情，馬上收回成命，特許繼續營業。於是老店新開，生涯鼎盛，老板顧客，皆大歡喜。　　本來至聖如孔子，尙且說：「死生有命，富貴在天。」聰明到做了萬世師表的人，對於運命，都這樣深信不疑，天下小民，如有再不信的，豈不是背叛聖敎，罪該萬死？孔敎在中國之不可推翻，也許這是一種原因。　　朋友某君，買了一張航空奬劵，請了個瞎子來算了算命；五行不缺，還是個「全木局，」木能生火，火爲財氣，眼前就有徧財可得。某君因此喜了幾個禮拜。到了開奬那天，買了張晚報來一對，從頭到尾，無一字相同，一天歡喜，完全落空。第二天，再把那瞎子找來問問原因，瞎子棆起輪盤一算，又說出一篇大道理：原來命中本該中頭奬，只因某一天無意中踏死了一隻螞蟻，大損陰德；便斷送了五十萬大洋。　　隔壁的太太養成了一個又長又大的兒子，想給他配婚，接來了許多庚帖，徧又是高不成，低不就；蹉跎半年，好容易看中了一家姑娘，做事又快又伶俐，人才又整齊，更好是門當戶對。請了個先生來合一合，女的八字太硬，還帶天狗，恐怕要碍夫。太太嘆了一口氣，只好把這件婚事擱下了。　　中國的國土給别人家搶了去，在許多憤懣聲中，我徧聽是幾句不冷不熱的話，那是一個遺老派的老先生說的，他說這話的時候，神氣堅决而鎭靜丨丨先是搖一搖頭，再嘆一嘆氣，然後冷冷的說：「泱泱乎大國也哉，而敗於小醜之</p>

<p>手，命矣夫！命矣夫！」把失國土也歸到命裏去，自難怪以後他聽見學生們請願的消息時，又復搖頭嘆氣而言曰：「是亦妄人也已矣！　　命運在中國人的心中是怎樣一件顚樸不破的東西。長生因爲承認了命，所以顚起屁股給别人踼，而不哼一聲痛。（見文學月刋一卷四號達生篇）。阿Ｑ雖然曾一次革過命，但也終於不得不承認了命，而被拖上法塲。城隍廟的看相測字批流年終身者是那麽多，而每天又是那麽好的生意。因此唯命論在中國，靠着這些傳道者的努力，是永遠滋榮繁盛的！女人的年紀  飛士　　我是不大喜歡問女孩子們的年紀的。這是我的識趣的世故。因爲我不願鼓着眼睛受别人的欺騙。欺騙本來有時是甜密密的，但總要閉着眼睛矇矇朧朧地呑下才感得到。自然感得到是一種幸福。而我却正是一個苦於没有這種幸福的人。所以不能不懂得那點識趣的世故。其實，一切的世故，大約多是從欺騙中生長起來的，這到表明了我也曾受過欺騙，不過終於張開眼睛，没有感至那種幸福罷了。　　在我們鄕間，素來是很尊重年紀的。「朝廷莫如爵，鄕黨莫如齒，」這是一般遺留下來的老秀才們常常在口邊唸着的話。就是那些被富貴人家壓得氣都出不了的泥脚幹老頭兒，亦常常在背地裏嚕囌着：「山高庶不着太陽，富貴壓不了鄕黨」。而事實上第逢吃淸明會的時候，的確是要序一序齒，襄那些年高的老頭兒坐坐上席的，雖然在平常也往往讓那些富貴的子弟們走走前面。所以，一般的人都很喜歡「三多吉慶」一類的恭維話。不說别的，就在我小的時候·亦很喜歡自已長大，長大像父親一樣。有時還特别爬上凳子，爬上桌子去和父親比比高低，一心想着只要像父親那樣的高就可以享受父親的特權了，至少不會再挨他的打。還記得，每逢過年的時候，當着除夕那天晚上，祖母摸着自已的頭頂說「乘孫頭，你又長了一歲了！」的時候，自己是多末的喜歡啊！　　長大了，進得學校，更加喜歡起年紀來。在小學的時候，操體操總是站在最後，我頂厭惡别人把我呌尾巴。而且一和别人打架，首先我就吃了身材短小的虧，别人手手都打在我的頭上和臉上。到了中學的時候，雖然身材是長得和别人差不多了，但一在結兄拜弟的塲合，我總是十有九回靠得着當老么跑腿的事便要算我的。我吃年紀的虧太大了！我那時唯一的辦法，就是希望快快長大，却並不知道將自己的年紀加上一個十字，竟連自己開初學算術就學得了的加法都不會用。多末的蠢呀！　　後來，又進了一個男女同校的學校，於是便和女孩子們來往起來了。同時，因了各色各樣的許多事情，也就和那些在社會中活躍的女子們熟識起來。那時候，我很羨慕她們，羨慕她們長得太快，單憑她們那高高的身材，練達的態度，便可以掩着她們所說的那小小的年紀而使别人將她們當作姊姊看待，驀然起一種敬仰之感。也許是因爲生於富貴人家，營養較好，發育優良的吧？我還這樣地想。不過有一點使我奇異而且也爲她們惋惜：爲什麽不將年紀說大一點，使名實相符呢？　　有一次，那是幾年前的事了，當我剛剛初到北平的那一天，衣同着靜姊一道來看我，並約我一道去吃晚飯。在席上我只默默地望着，望着窗外，望着窗外那點綴着繁星的靑天。普通的交際話是不適宜的，卽使要談談天氣，眼前也只有一個分不出晴明和陰暗的黑夜。想談的話也無從談起，我所見着和設着的衣已經相差得太遠了。沈默的偉大！然而她們却絮絮不休地，一時問我這樣，一時問我那樣，一時談到這裏，一時又談到那裏，終於竟從她們的生活談到過去，忽然使我從衣的話中感着我是在鼓着眼睛受她的欺騙了。她不但人和過去相差得遠，就連年紀也到退了幾歲。事後我問到靜姊，靜姊向我說：「這是我們女子的習慣，如果不少說兩歲别人也要多加上兩歲，誰呌你相信眞的呢」？從此我才知道女子折習慣正和我相反，她們是以爲年紀愈小愈好的。而且我知道了去問，她們的年紀等於去求欺騙。　　這幾年來，我一向都沿用這一點敎訓去對女孩子，結果就長成而且確立了這個識趣的世故。但許多的女孩子還正在用這種不能欺騙着人的欺騙去欺騙人。要免掉這種欺騙，只有那些不以靑春和美麗出賣於人的女孩子，將來婦女的希望大約應該放在這樣的女孩子身上吧。觀女靑年會女工演劇（下）  凌鶴　　第二個劇是「香姐」，所寫的是江湖賣技的三人，爲了女兒不能翻觔斗，於是父親拿起皮鞭來打女兒了。這時有一個工人，自台下走上去爲女兒打道不平，將慘無人道的父親打了一頓，其後是女兒請求那人住手，從她的言詞中，說明她們因兵災而從鄕下逃來，爲了窮不能不如此。到後父親也承認自己的錯誤，成爲悲劇的結束。這一劇採取了新的形式，台上和台正打成一片，這不僅是台下抛銅板到台上去，而演員夾在觀衆中間。和劇中人對話，以及台下人走上台去，都是在這裏應當提出的。這種形式，假使演得好的話，自然可以收着更好的效果，特别可以使全部觀衆成爲劇中人，假使劇本是如此决定的話。　　第三劇「街頭夜景」，是冩一羣逃兵災的難民，她們飢餓，疾病，疲乏，無家可歸，只好在街頭過夜。可是巡捕却來干涉她們，說是不准在别人的窗口停留。而窗口中傳出的是銅琴聲和女人們淫佚的笑聲，與窗外病人的呻吟相應和。到後來有賣湯糰的，有野雞，也有流浪着的靑年。我們看見巡捕調戲雉妓，流浪要人打巡捕，難民偸了别人的湯糰吃，而難民的包裏，却給别人偸去了。最後，原來那野雞和流浪人都是那病了的難民之兒女，在一陣哭聲中閉幕了。　　關於這一劇，我不想在劇本方面多說話，所要說到的，因爲有着固定的台詞，所以劇的空氣相當嚴肅。而我們再看當時觀衆的情緒，都注意而緊張，甚至於都座位上站了起來，不肯忽視劇中每一句對話。因此我們可以證明，工人們的鑒賞水凖雖然較低，然而假使劇中所描寫的是她們本身生活或者是接近了她們之生活的時候，她們决不至於不能理解的。正相反，她們已經是給劇中人深的感動了。　　當然，我們並不說這一遽演得十分高明，至少在導演和表演的技術方面，假使有專門家爲之指導，將必然有着更好的效果。然而一般的說，至少文明戲的成份是比較前二劇减少的。因此，我們在此可得着事實的證明。一貫的我們從前都有着錯誤的認識，以爲對於工人們祇有文明戲方能够使她們滿足，而現在相反的她們正需要嚴肅的空氣和深重的剌戟，那末我們爲什麽不使她們走上更技術的路上去呢？這是每一個從事劇運的人們，目前切要的任務。　　最後，我對於女靑年會主持這次演劇的女士們，深深的懷誠懇的敬意，她們認淸了時代，而且擔當了一般從事劇運的人所不也擔當的煩難的任務。因此，我們僅希望她在技術上更能盡可能的注意，以達到完善的境地。不消說這，種熱心而努力的試騐，在中國的戲劇運動上，自有其重大的意義。謹祝福她們努力！風雨之夜  純　　時間已過夜半了，從局裏落了夜班回來。朔風暴雨，没些兒春天的氣息。雇了一部人力車，人覺得太疲倦了，在車上本可藉以休息的絕刀機會；但荒凉的馬路，兩旁的房子，多已熄了燈，關了門，僅能看見兩邊兩排高高的黑影，一陣陣風，一陣陣雨，在這種風雨凄微的深夜，一部洋車慢屯屯的拖過，宛似在冷冰冰的地道裏走一般，是何等的悽慘而製人啊：人反提起了精神，好像在預防有什麽意外的襲撃。心裏起了一陣恐懼的波折，於是就疑慮到，隨時隨物，多帶有重大的恐懼性，愈恐懼而愈疑慮，愈疑慮而愈恐懼；灣腰驼前　天的後影，在他是抽了血，吸了髓的象徵，在我看來，好像是魔鬼的憧憬，他那不平均的呼吸，在他是力竭聲嘶的喘息，在我聽來，好像是病人垂死時的呻吟。在這種恐懼的壓迫之下走着，我覺得走了有幾個鐘頭以上的時候，實則大約走了二十分鐘的光景，僅僅走完了一半的路。　　「嗚嗚」似泣似喊低低的一陣呼聲，襲入我的耳鼓；恐懼的心弦，又特然的彈了一下，不禁使我打了一個寒噤，但矛盾的好奇心，又迫着我看過究竟；一座高大的洋房，門口一盞扁圓形的電燈，紅色的光，映出「安樂居」三個字，照着水門汀的石級上，倦伏着有黑團團的一堆；大約是一個婦人吧，從微弱的燈光中可以看出她那亂蓬蓬的一個髻。一縷柔弱的呼聲，就從那裏傳出。　　「這是什麽？」我一半是奇怪這種現象；一半想拿我的談話聲，衝破這單調的哀鳴，或能减少我心中的恐懼，故意向車夫發問。　　「没有什麽，沿路產小孩吧。」車夫似乎司空見慣的回答我。　　「唔，養孩子，露天養孩子。」我自念自語的接着說了一遍。車子是走過了許多路，但鳴嗚的呼聲，在我似乎仍舊聽到，並且愈淸越愈悲切，好似一縷遊絲，掛在我的心懷。　　「緊暖的一間房，朝南的窗子，一張單人鐵牀，兩張櫃子，一張長條桌，兩三把小凳，都和那間房裏的牆壁門窗，一樣地漆得雪白，有一張櫃子的門，是玻璃做的，裏面分層擺着許多剪刀，許多管子。一張臨盆手術榻，整個兒用白琺瑯質做的，上面鋪着一個大的氣墊。兩個安琪兒似的女看護，各自拿了產婦應吃的東西，如牛乳之類。慈祥滿面的年老醫生，頻頻的在撫摩着產婦的腹部，好似慈母催眼臨睡時的小孩一樣。熒熒的爐火，照着各個人的臉，呈現着熟蘋果樣的紅色。」　　「孤零零的一個風雨凄　凉的寒夜，在水門汀上打滾哭喊，在驅迫着小生命的出世，能使人昏厥過去的痛，由呻吟而喊呌的哀聲，捨未出世的小生命爲她唯一的伴侶外，就只有她自己。緊緊的幾陣痛，拍的一聲小生命就在這風雨之下產生了。經過了幾次昏而復醒，趕快的收拾了一切。但那不可磨滅的血跡，終於因沾汚了那水門汀而遭人家的叱駡。」　　我斯時而想到醫院裏的接生房，又幻想到剛剛的一幕露天生產；代替了那恐懼盤據在我的腦際，好像兩張不同的影片，在我的眼前開映。這時風聲雨滴，愈變愈緊，激動了我車上的油蓬。打魚殺家  猛大敎師率領黃三和郭先生將花逢春底出路攔住；大使着他們底百般武藝。說時遲，那時快；逢春被逼不過，揮刀向前一衝：便把他們一齊都殺了早知如此  小岑　　有一個老婦，她的兒媳都死去了，遺下的只是一個孩兒，所以她老人家看他像傳家寳一樣，好細心的看護看；因　她要他　嗣，要他供　遇　一切祖先的燈火香燭，他因此成了家裏的太上皇，要去省讀書就上省去，要什麽就有什麽，從没有逆過意的。末後他公然在省中學畢業回來，婆孫倆備形慶樂，隔壁所有一些三嬸二嫂之流都聚攏來替她老人家祝賀；有很多不識字的阿嬸和嫂子們還要趁便來請她的孫兒替她們的女兒妹子寫年庚，那曉得他拿起筆來對着紅紙頭在打抖，有的又要請他看看紅本通書，擇個洗頭或是出行的吉日，他把通書從頭到末的番了好幾次也還看不出所以然，他埋怨書的印刷不明。有天天是祖先忌辰，老媽子敎他上前叩頭，他只走近去鞠了三個不深不淺的躬，祖母積氣至今，恨無可忍，伸出縐皮的手，老不客氣的給他一個從未嘗受過的爽脆的耳光，還得恨恨的念：「早知如此，誰肯給你進什麽鬼混學堂！枉費了祖母的錢！」　　　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　　一個失業多年的大學生，有一天他忽然想了一個妙計，他自己以爲方法高明，獨個子在房間歡跳不已，形出自己的把握和有成功的希望。隨後毫不遲疑地把他唯一的一套比較時髦點的西裝送到押店，結果換得五塊大洋錢回來，他再打量了好一會，又把五塊錢變成兩盒洋餅乾，維愼維謹的送給隔璧一位局長，請他帮忙介紹到各機關裏面去當一點小差事，呆是局長使丫頭出來回答：現在各機關裏都在裁員，目前不能給你介紹，不過，等些時間總可以吧！當然，失業的人，肚皮餓的人，時刻都只好坐着等候有錢有勢的人們有一天會恩賜！第二天聽說局長的侄子，從南洋失業回來，第三天聽說他已當個二等科員了。大學生自己想：他所希望的只是做個三等科員，爲什麽局長受了我的餅乾，還要呌我等待，我不是等待了好幾年了嗎？欺騙吧？現在弄到西裝也完了，早知如此，又何必去乞憐！　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　一對靑年的夫婦，他倆終日吵閙不休，妻子呵責丈夫好發脾氣，丈夫却說妻不够摩登，有時候似非閙到離婚不可！但，離婚的執據，必得跑到律師那兒去，可是當跨出那律師事務所的頭一夜，那丈夫就感到非常寂寞，好像　了什麽似的，整夜踱來踱去，甚至睡上床去的時候，更感到不安，被窩裏又怪空的，老是疏冷着，脚跟尤其凍冰冰的，然後心裏在打量：没有妻子是不成的。没有好久之後，他又找了一個更合心意的妻子，可是她又太摩登了一點，天天要和許多男朋友去跳舞，每個月要化好些錢在服裝上面，丈夫勸她要節省點兒，跳舞不要跳到天亮。妻子說：你管不了我。轉過面就送上一個給丈夫的耳光。這時候他悔恨的說「早知如此······」。面孔弄錯  惠　　由於造物主偶然的疏怱吧，一張漂亮的面孔竟按排在做娘姨的身。　　雖然她是年近三十的婦人，但命運是加倍的揶揄她，給她以綽約的風姿，假使不是熟客人

<p>電影專刊　中華民國貳拾叁年伍月柒日星期壹　敎育電影在中國（三）  盧時白（四）急迫的危機與挽救　　　從中國發現了提倡敎育電影的呼聲之後的四年過程中，雖有好些洋洋灑灑的計劃，若干聶聶烈烈的組織，但是能够成爲事實者，惟中宣會及軍委會出版三四十卷新聞影片，以及中國敎育電影恊會與全國敎育電影推廣處的實施工作而已。　　作者决不信中國無深切明瞭電影的力量之人，亦决不信國内無願以百折不撓之精神，貢獻於敎育電影之輩，然而祗有提倡的呼聲，萝想的計劃者，其最大原因，實在是受無上權威的經濟作祟。最近中國敎育電影恊會上海分會，在上海市之實施工作，就是因爲經濟無辦法，以致虧累日甚，而有停頓之慮。上海實施敎育電影，是全國的首創者，各各省所以一時紛紛推行敎育電影的動機無非因爲上海的實施有效，所以相繼仿行，假使上海而停頓工作，那末影響所及，中國敎育電影的前途，有不願言不忍言者矣！　　中國敎育電影恊會，既非營業性質，無資金可以徵集，又非政府機關，無公帑可以支應，政府所援助的經費，總會方面，僅敎育部，内政部，電影檢查委員會的每月津貼一百元，最近電影檢查委員會改組了，此項津貼，是否繼續撥發，或者是一個問題呢！至於上海分會，曾兩次請求市政府予以補助，均以市庫支絀爲辭，毫無結果，僅僅市黨部每月津貼一百元。而該分會既負實際工作的使命，職員達十餘人之多，每月開支，至少須一千三百元以上，區區的津貼，自然不敷甚巨，雖該分會收入方面，尙有學校車費，及廣告費約八九百元之譜，但是每月不敷總在四五百金。而且一到寒暑假，學校放假，此項收入，頓時斷絕。且開辦的時候，卽向人借籌巨欵以購置機件。現在債務淸償乏術，而未來籌墊，又是是無從着想。作者謹擬定幾個可能性的辦法。　　（一）徵集基金：没有基金，根本就没有保障。有了基金，就有保障，工作者就可安心，而事業之進展，亦遂迅速。故徵集基金，是一件根本的工作。　　（二）奬勵捐資：獎勵民衆捐資，亦是一件輕而易舉的工作。政府現在對於捐資興學的熱心人士，極力奬勵。假使我們認電影是敎育對於捐資提倡敎育電影的熱心者，予以激勵，我深信不難有人願意提倡。　　上述兩項辦法，前者爲積極的，後者爲消極的。倘能雙方並進，則敎育電影在最短期間，不難普及於全國。　　（四）推行範圍應努力擴大　　謀敎育電影之普及，推行是第一步的工作。我們現在縱然没有自製的影片能力，而必須仰給於外人，而必須增加一些入超，但祇是値得的。我們要有很多的地方在推行，我們以巨額的金錢去攝製影片，才不致收效僅及一部份。（未完）影片談評評「鶼𪃸雙飛」  亞夫SheMadeHerBed——國泰　　在許多所謂「軟性影片」之中，這應當是一部比較的有趣味的作品吧？我想。　　當然，所謂電影的軟性論根本就没有存在的理由，這除了有意的爲了某種任務而對於電影藝術的眞價加以無聊的曲解之外，是没有較好之用意的。然而就將毫無嚴肅内容的影片歸於「軟性」之類，也正是他們所願望的罷。因此，「鶼𪃸雙飛」也許就是軟性電影之範圍以内的作品了。　　極平凡的戀愛故事，便是本片之全部内容。但是編劇或導演爲了將一多角的戀愛糾紛形象化起來，却費了不少心力而將故事說得非常生動。所以當人們閒着無事而必需娱樂一番的時候，有如在書塲裏聽「珍珠塔」之類的彈詞一樣，這一影片是很可以給你消愁解悶的。　　的確，作者（包涵全部的技術人員）將這一影片描寫得生動。利用着觀衆的既成心理，一方面寫了一對男女的好良心，而另一面却同時寫一對不正徑的男女互相對照。於是好良心的博得了觀衆的同情，便使他們一直好至底，使用一切方法，讓他們有情人好合以終HappyEnding的滿足了觀衆之慾望，而同時對於奸夫淫婦便使他們一直壞到底，一直到不得好死爲止。這種手法，本是美國影片中所常見的，而千篇一律的運手，却多少總有人爲之感動。　　但是這種事件，也許是我們可以常見的。譬如莎麗愛戀所飾的少婦，她賢淑，她能守婦道，但是她和丈夫結婚四年，却得不着眞實的愛情，「切都忍耐下去，雖然有一個忠實的男子向她表示愛情。而她的丈夫，羅伯亞姆斯暢所飾的杜克，却也是我們可以常見的，他一方面很愛他的妻，但同時却和不三不四的女人勾搭。劇作者從他自命爲動物馴練家而給貓抓破手臂並死於虎鬭之下以描寫他的個性，的確是很可愛的。李却理倫的角色，更是一個極平凡的人，但毫無特色，而格拉絲柏勒萊所飾的流浪女，不將她寫得過於淫蕩，使她和杜克之間，也有所謂愛情的成分，這又是我們所常見的了。因此，從整個的故事發展上說，再經導演靈活的手腕和演員的恰當表演，都給與人們一種平凡的眞實感。　　不過，在最後作者爲了大快人心，爲了要博人們之同情，那一塲手槍，虎與人搏，再加上大火所形成的高潮，却是誇張了故事之平凡性的，雖然在手法上很見高明。　　如上所述，本片自有其相當成績，不過没有深刻的内容，却　是劇作者之意識的决定。評「孽海無邊」  憶君BureauofMissingPersons丨南京映丨　　正因爲這一個社會的制度有其本身的缺陷的緣故，無論在中國，美國，英國，或是法國，祇要是這一個社會制度存在在那一個國家裏，那末便因這一個社會制度的缺陷而發生了綁票，逃亡，自希等事情。　　看一看我們自己的國家裏，祇就上海一埠來說，那綁票，逃亡，殉情，自希，或因姦謀殺的案件，幾乎每天都在發生，而在燦爛黃金美國裏，去年也竟有二萬七千個人的失踪，其緣由是很容易明白的。　　以年來稀有之描寫社會罪惡爲號召的「孽海無邊」却並没有告訴我們社會的原因。　　這實在是一個偵探與一個少女的羅曼史，而又穿着「偵探片」的外衣。　　像通常的偵探片一樣，在這裏故佈了一個疑陣，那個少女被爲殺人犯，結果自然水落石出，那個少女不是兇手，而另一個人才是兇手，在這裏敢有像普通偵探片裏巧遇，瑙瑪會重又來到殯儀館裏，而瑙瑪也恰會遇到了那個兇手。這眞是非常巧的。　　「孽海無邊」雖是和通常的偵探片差不了多少，然而導演RoyDelRuth和編劇在這裏却處理得很好的，特别是在蒲區捉住兇手走出而瑙瑪又不見，後來却是先回到了管理部裏，以及最後的喜劇化的滑稽的結束。　　蓓蒂黛維絲，和彼脫亞勃林演來均成功，魯意司東也很稱職。電通公司徵求女演員　　創製三友式有聲電影錄音機之電通影片公司近擬攝製有聲影片一部，由應雲衛導演，男主角亦已聘定舞臺演員袁牧之担任，惟女主角則尙未决定，該公司爲培養新人材起見，决定徵求新演員。凡年在十八至廿四歲之間，能說純熟國語中等學校畢業有相當文藝修養，均可應徵。（有話劇經騐者尤佳）有志投考者開明履歷住址並附四寸以上相片一張投寄蒲石路怡安坊七三號該公司可也。（十日報名截止）中華影業公司重整旗鼓　「殘兵」片行將攝竣　　中華影對公司創辦於民十九年，在江灣自置有房屋田產及攝影塲等，規模尙稱宏大。曾出有「荒山情俠」一片，公映於滬漢平津各地。當時頗得各地觀衆之好評。後該公司以受一二八滬變影響，各股東相率星散，致業務無形停頓。今春該公司前任經理張富巖君鑒於年來電影事業之澎湃，社會之需要，特召集原有同志，重整旗鼓。第一片爲「殘兵」。聞該片以農民愛國致遭犧牲爲背景，片中頗多悲壯熱烈之處。刻各演員正加緊趕拍，預計在一月後，卽可公映於吾人眼簾矣。電影小說大富之家(TheHouseofRothschild)（十）（四）  文印　　南丹露德蔡和勒特蘭資鬥法的時候，弗蘭克福的大規模排猶運動，已經發生了。等到南丹佔了勝利，回到他公事房的時候，他從他的哥哥阿姆希爾那裏，得到了一封密函，上面寫着：「倫敦，南丹丨此處發生盛大排猶運動，並已普遍普魯士全境。得函速返。弗蘭克福，阿姆希爾」。南丹得了那個言，就立卽束裝就道，回弗蘭克福去了。他到了弗蘭克福的猶太人街的入口處，他下了馬車，祇見街上舖滿了碎玻璃，全是猶太人店戶住家窗戶上的玻璃，被暴徒磚石撃碎的。他下了車，怱怱地跑回家中。古都拉開了門，歡迎着她的兒子。南丹對着他道：「你们還是離開此地吧，這個地位太不穩當了。」那老太婆哼了一聲，笑着說道：「你當我怕那」羣亂民嗎。我過了八十八年的這種生活了。我生在這裏的，我亦要死在這裏！那日子亦快到了。要是我要活到一百歲的話，上帝亦决不在八十八歲就呌我死的！」阿姆希爾跑了進來，後面跟着漢娜和珠麗，於是急速地開着家族會議。　　這時有一個少年騎着一匹大馬，奔馳地來到猶太人街的入口處。他在馬背上問着一羣的人道：「你們誰知道露德蔡住在那裏？」一個流氓從地下拾了一塊石頭答應道：「我知道」！他將石頭照凖了一家的窗戶擲了過去說道：「那就是！」珠麗那時正站在窗戶口，那塊石頭直打進去，將她嚇了一跳，她從窗戶口往外一張，看見費茲洛伊站在門外。她顫抖着呌他轉到後門去。等到費茲少洛伊進了屋子，珠麗告訴他說：「父親正在家。他還没有變更他的意思。我們有什麽辦法呢？」費茲毅然地答道：「我去見他去！寳貝，我愛你，你不可以作一個勇收的兵士嗎？」他說了，從衣袋裏摸出一個戒指替她戴着，一面說道：「請你戴上這個，這是我母親的東西。一但是南丹没有等他替珠麗戴上戒指，已走了進來阻止了他。他走到費茲洛伊的面前，高聲地說道：「你爲什麽到這裏來？難道你還不知道我的意思嗎？」　　「我到這裏來的用意，亦正和你到這裏來的用意相同，」費茲洛伊回答道：「我聽見道裏出了亂子丨珠麗太危險了。」南丹吩咐他的女兒道：「到你母親那兒去。」珠麗不敢違背她父親的話就答應了。南丹等珠麗走了，然後對着費茲洛伊道：「我所以不讓你和我的女兒相見，是有極充足的理由的。我希望你能尊重我的意思。」費茲道：「但是我們已經深深相愛了，這是關於她的幸福和我的幸福的。」南丹道：「你在這溝頭巡視一下。你到普魯士境内各城的猶太人街去看看丨你可以看得到死傷枕藉的人丨珠麗的同種同族丨都是被你的同種同族的人殺死的丨他們犯的什麽罪？祗有一個非丨因爲他們是猶太人！所以你倒顧到珠麗的幸福，和你自已的幸福，你不要將這個個忘記了，」（未完）</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese side is constructing an airfield in Nankai Balitai in Tianjin.

Kawaguchi, a staff officer of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, stated at the Public Security Bureau on the evening of the 5th that the Balitai airfield was not related to the military department, but was being handled by the Japanese Civil Aviation Postal Co., Ltd., Okura Group, and the Chinese Guangrentang. The military headquarters bears no responsibility for this. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Organization Is Actively Reorganizing Its Military Strength, Preparing to Expand Outward</h3>

<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in Tangshan Conduct Another Combat Exercise</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army stationed in Tangshan notified our Public Security Bureau that, starting from the 5th, the army would conduct combat exercises at the Xishan shooting range from 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM every day for one week, prohibiting pedestrians from passing through the area. On the afternoon of the 4th, a team of Japanese soldiers arrived in Lutai from Fengtai in a loaded truck.

<h3>Northeastern Volunteers Attack Japanese Immigrant Group</h3>

There were many casualties on both sides. (6th Telegraphic Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Another Train Robbery Occurs on the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Another train robbery by "bandits" occurred 77 miles west of Harbin.

<h3>Japanese Encircle Land Near Dongluo to Build a Puppet Road</h3>

Materials are now being transported, and construction will begin soon. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Yuguan was taken over by our side, the police force has been unable to thoroughly eliminate the activities of traitors due to various constraints from the Japanese. Whenever bandits rob, the police are unarmed, making it impossible to arrest them. Tao Shangming negotiated with the Japanese on the issue of police carrying weapons, and it is expected to be resolved soon. Although there are various rumors about the direct train service between Beiping and Shenyang, the Japanese have recently been focusing on the construction of a puppet Fengshan road in Dongluocheng, and have demarcated the terminal station to be built near Dongluocheng. The engineering design is the same as that of the Shenyang Main Station. Bricks and stone materials are already being transported, and construction will begin soon. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Puppet Government Levies Customs Duties in Duolun City</h3>

<h3>Yu Feipeng Denies News of Postal Service to the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Feipeng, the Deputy Minister of Communications, said that the news from Tokyo that the issues of through train and postal services to the Northeast are about to be implemented is not true. He said that the issue of through train service is not under the jurisdiction of this Ministry, and he does not wish to interfere. As for the issue of postal service, he can responsibly reply that the facts are not accurate, and it has not been mentioned. The rumors outside are all speculation. Except for the 50-li area of the South Manchurian Railway, which is still open for postal service as usual due to treaty restrictions, all other areas are sealed off.

<p>(Nanjing) The situation in the Far East is serious. The Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to open on the 14th of this month. A diplomat said that after the Council of the League of Nations meeting opens, it will first discuss the annual spring cases, including the war in the Grand Chaco of South America and the 1935 Saar Basin resident referendum. Regarding the non-recognition of Manchukuo and all disputes between China and Japan, a special advisory committee of the League of Nations on China and Japan will be convened separately for discussion, and then submitted to the General Assembly for resolution. Our country has sent Gu Weijun as a representative to report on Japan's unilateral organization of the puppet government. We firmly believe that the dignity of the League of Nations covenant will be justly resolved and sanctioned, and the path to a just resolution depends on our own efforts. When asked whether there have been direct negotiations between China and Japan recently, he replied that this is a propaganda of the Japanese people to arouse internal political struggles in our country. Any negotiations can be conducted under the principle that our country does not cede territory and does not lose sovereignty. However, whether the Japanese side can abandon its ambition to invade China and abolish the puppet organization under its control is still unknown, so it is not yet possible to talk about it, and there is no direct negotiation to speak of. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations' Policy on Technical Cooperation with China Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(London) The Sunday Times' Geneva dispatch today stated that the League of Nations, for the first time in many years, issued an article in the name of the Secretariat denying the news published in the newspaper. After talking with League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, Yokoyama, the Japanese Consul-General in Geneva, told a reporter that he had been assured that the League of Nations' assistance to China in the future would be limited to education and health programs. Secretary-General Avenol specifically issued a denial yesterday, saying that this matter had not been discussed.

It is estimated that Lv's troops were reorganized into one cavalry brigade under the command of Zhu Shaoliang. Because the number of people gathered by Ding and Yang was only enough for one brigade, they were immediately reorganized into the Second Cavalry Brigade of the 15th Route Army, with Ding appointed as a senior counselor of the general headquarters and Yang Ganchen as the commander of the Second Brigade. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chen Jintang and Others Do Not Oppose Reform of the Provincial System</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to political sources, the Central Government believes that there are many malpractices in the current provincial system, such as the lack of specific responsibility of the committee system, the discrepancies in the decrees of the various departments, and the unclear systems of municipal administration in the various counties, which are all obstacles to the development of administration. It has specially proposed a plan to reform the provincial system to make up for its shortcomings. Chen Jintang, Li Zongren, and others are happy to support the Central Government's reform of the provincial system, because the change to a provincial governor system in the constitutional period does not conflict with the National Construction Program. Key figures in the Central Government believe that as various provinces are striving for production and construction under the supervision of the Central Government, it is difficult to achieve unified results without full-time personnel responsible for planning. The current committee system really needs to be reformed, and no province dares to disagree with the reform of the provincial system. Guangdong and Guangxi cannot stand alone and disrupt the unity of the administrative organization. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Control Yuan Drafts Opinions on Revising the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan believes that the draft constitution drafted by the Legislative Yuan is not perfect in terms of the powers of the Control Yuan, and has decided to submit opinions to the Constitution Drafting Committee for revision. It has pushed Liu Wuqing to draft the manuscript and handed it to Secretary-General Wang Luyi to take to Shanghai for the President of the Yuan to review. It will be revised soon and sent to the Legislative Yuan. According to Liu Wuqing, the points for revising the organization and powers of the Control Yuan are: (1) Guaranteeing the tenure of supervisors for more than ten years or for life; (2) The selection of supervisors should be by nomination instead of by popular election, and the president of the Yuan should also be nominated, but only those who are detached and have no strong factional affiliation should be nominated; (3) Once an impeachment is filed, regardless of military, political, or public affairs, a disciplinary agency must be formed to handle it. The members of the disciplinary agency must be nominated as detached and must have considerable guarantees. Whether it belongs to the Control Yuan or not should be decided by the Central Government; (4) The county council is a body of public opinion and only has the power of recall, not the power of impeachment, let alone reporting; (5) The Audit Department should still maintain the ministerial system, not the committee system. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Patriotic Progressive Association Opposes the Vajra Dharma Assembly; Strengthening the Country and Defending Against Insults Requires Promoting Science</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Chinese Patriotic Progressive Association issued a declaration stating that the Vajra Dharma Assembly is a waste of money and manpower, which is sufficient to hinder the New Life Movement. The people of the country should uphold the Premier's scientific spirit and promote science to strengthen the country and defend against insults. People who care about the difficulties of the times should promote science. The national situation is extremely critical. Salvation lies in self-reflection. The Dufferin of India cannot make a deceased country revive. Even if there are thousands of Panchen Lamas and Vajras, they cannot resolve the domestic disasters or promote world peace. Such foolish behavior will be ridiculed by foreigners and may even lead to the partition of the great powers, aggravating the suffering of the nation. It is hoped that everyone will wake up and unite to oppose it. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhaoming, the President of the Executive Yuan, believes that the Kalachakra Vajra Dharma Assembly presided over by the Panchen Lama has the merit of protecting the country and eliminating disasters, so he specially donated 1,000 yuan to subsidize it. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Principles Decided for Improving Judicial Facilities in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Xinjiang Construction Planning Committee has decided on several principles for improving judicial facilities in Xinjiang, which will be submitted to the Central Government for transfer to the judicial authorities for adoption and implementation. The content includes: 1. Within a certain period, first improve and strengthen the Urumqi Higher Court, select a site to establish a branch of the Higher Court, and complete the local courts in each county. 2. Cultivate judges. The Ministry of Justice will establish a Xinjiang Judge Training Institute to cultivate talents. Judicial officials must be proficient in both Uyghur and Chinese and be familiar with Islamic religious law. Before the courts are established, all counties must be strictly ordered to prohibit torture. The existing religious law and judgment should still follow customs. Where religious law and law do not conflict, follow the law; where they conflict, follow religious law. Gradually educate the people of Xinjiang to gradually change their habit of abiding by religious law and abide by the law, and promote the joint trial of courts and religious judges.

<h3>League of Nations and the Far East</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>The League of Nations Council will hold its spring session in the middle of this month. The agenda for this meeting includes: first, the issue between France and Germany in Europe, namely the administration of the Saar region; and second, the war between Paraguay and Bolivia in South America. Although the latter is not closely related to the overall global situation, it is indeed a significant test of the League of Nations' credibility. If such a minor conflict cannot be mediated or its war prevented, then larger issues will be even more intractable. The most important issue is the "Manchurian Problem," which has shocked the world and destabilized the Far East since September 18th, becoming one of the main factors leading to a potential Second World War. This problem has not only caused China repeated humiliation and placed it in an extremely difficult position, but it has also made European and American powers deeply aware of the severe threat, yet there is still no concrete response strategy to curb Japan's aggression.</p>
<p>Currently, major international powers are largely abandoning the conference-style diplomacy of international cooperation and indulging in the competition for hegemony. This is the case in Europe and also in the Far East. The deteriorating relationship between Germany and France, and the tension in European affairs can be set aside for the moment. Even the profound economic panic is enough to divert the attention of each country, which are desperately focused on exploring overseas markets in an attempt to salvage their own urgent difficulties. International understanding is simply impossible. Consequently, they are moving towards a policy of armed monopoly. Japan's invasion of the four northeastern provinces of China is the most obvious example. Over the past two years, the Japanese have long sought to exclusively swallow the Northeast, refusing the intrusion of any international forces. However, as the powers gradually realized that their rights were being infringed upon and protested, Japan realized that it was not easy to solely control the Far East. Thus, there was a plan to recognize international investment, on the one hand, introducing international capital to assist them, and on the other hand, using this to solidify their so-called "accomplished facts" to exert their aggressive tactics.</p>
<p>The League of Nations, located in Europe, has very little vested interest in the Far East. Furthermore, Japan's withdrawal from the League has deprived it of its binding force. Recently, although rumors of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations and the United States assisting the League have been widely circulated, from a practical point of view, the Soviet Union's intention to join the League is merely to secure its western border. Although the Soviet Union has signed non-aggression treaties with its neighboring countries, these countries are small and weak and cannot shield the Soviet Union. The patriotism of the German National Socialist Party is also developing rapidly. If something happens, can it be guaranteed that it will not break through the borders of small countries? Therefore, it is known that the Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations has more significance in seeking its own security and less significance for the Far Eastern issue. As for the United States, at most it will only provide some assistance to the League in terms of morality and further extend the justice of international treaties, so that ambitious countries will be warned and restrained. Beyond that, it is feared that there will be no actual power, which is the general expectation.</p>
<p>When the Council meets, we should fully recognize that the League of Nations is essentially a moral international organization. In actual implementation, it is still controlled by individual countries. The idea of international cooperation has become a thing of the past. Currently, what countries are striving for is the development of economic nationalism at home and the competition for overseas markets abroad. Defining a scope to seek a temporary balance of power is no longer possible. The recent expressions of the United Kingdom and the United States towards Japan are all based on their own interests, and this is something we cannot fail to pay close attention to. Furthermore, the Japanese ambition of aggression will never be restrained by international restrictions. The second step of their continental policy is still being plotted in North China, and they are creating causes of trouble everywhere in South China. The madness of the so-called "era of Taiwan" has been repeatedly uttered by Japanese warlords. This kind of aggressive policy cannot be eased solely by relying on diplomatic power without equal strength to counter it. This is the second point that we must pay attention to. Moral sanctions and public opinion support are indeed necessary diplomatic means in today's world, but they must be backed by strength in order to be effective. As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." Is this just empty talk?</p>
<h3>Economic Warfare: Britain and Japan in Head-to-Head Confrontation; Rejecting Japanese Goods with Decisive Action; British Merchants to Issue Statement Today; Tokyo Authorities Carefully Plan Countermeasures</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers the cotton industry note submitted by three British merchants, including Sir Simon, to Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira to be an extremely unfriendly document. Even though today is Sunday, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are still frequently visiting and carefully studying countermeasures. However, it has not yet been decided whether to issue a response to Britain's request within a few days. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has glimpsed Britain's firm attitude in the note, in the interest of caution, it may wait for Sir Simon's statement on the issue in the British House of Commons before making a final determination on its attitude towards Britain, and then decide on the response. (China United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) It seems that the British Cabinet has taken swift and decisive action to counter Japanese goods competition, which is likely to be implemented. Overseas Trade Minister Colville officially accepted the two resolutions passed by the National Federation of Conservative Party groups in the Lancaster area at a meeting in Manchester tonight in the name of the government. Colville declared that Trade Minister Sir Simon will make a statement in the House of Commons next Monday, which will satisfy anyone who is not in favor of the Holy See's attitude towards Japanese goods competition. Regarding this issue, the most contentious issue at present is the attitude of the various autonomous colonies. The attitude of the autonomous colonies is divided into two aspects. One aspect advocates maintaining the "spirit of the Ottawa Conference," that is, internal cooperation within the empire to defend against foreign goods competition. The other aspect believes that the current British Empire must require sacrifices from the various autonomous colonies in order to protect its own production. Therefore, it is difficult for the various autonomous colonies to abandon their excellent customers. (Japan is one of the British autonomous colonies' excellent customers for raw materials.) According to the general impression of the Conservative Party or government media, it seems that the governments of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand fully express sympathy for the motives of the mother country in preventing Japanese goods competition, but should not be regarded as having binding force and must follow the measures of the mother country. According to the Observer, "If Japan replies and rejects the British proposal, the British government will take measures to limit the import quota of Japanese goods to all parts of the British Empire. However, this measure must be decided after consultation with the relevant parts. It is heard that the colonies have already agreed to this method, and the autonomous colonies are also fully sympathetic to the attitude of the British Cabinet." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Telegram Inquires about Scope of Applicable Regions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering the British note of the 3rd and subsequent information. However, the British proposal is an abstract ratio. Although the products are limited to cotton textiles and rayon, the scope of applicable regions only refers to the Royal Empire. It is unclear whether it only refers to colonies or includes autonomous colonies and autonomous territories. Yesterday afternoon, a telegram was sent to Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira in the United Kingdom to inquire with the British authorities. A countermeasure will be considered after Ambassador Matsudaira's reply. Whether to submit a concrete plan by Japan or to request a more active proposal from Britain will be decided after this attitude is determined, and then a telegram will be sent to Ambassador Matsudaira to negotiate with the British government. (Dentsu, 6th)</p>
<h3>Acknowledging the Serious Nature of the British Note</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun published an editorial on the British government's note on Sino-Japanese consultations, saying that the British note intends to prevent the entry of general Japanese goods and can in fact be regarded as an ultimatum in terms of trade. The agreed products are not limited to cotton cloth, but expanded to general parts, which is difficult to understand. Originally, the purpose of the Sino-Japanese consultations was to agree on the market for Sino-Japanese cotton cloth. If the Japanese side is forced to make a unilateral agreement, Japan will definitely not agree. If Japan refuses, and Britain threatens to implement a ratio system for imports, Japan will have no choice but to take retaliatory measures against the goods of Britain and its directly controlled colonies in order to resist.

<h3>Japanese Silk Dumping Meets Strong Opponent; Italian Silk Captures Polish Market</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Japanese exports are encountering a strong opponent for the first time in the European market. There has been long-standing competition between Japanese silk and Italian-produced silk, but in the past, Italy found it difficult to sell in Poland due to higher costs. For example, a certain type of Italian silk had to be sold for 14 Swiss francs, while Japanese silk of the same quality was sold for only 13 francs. However, Italian silk is now being sold for as low as 12 francs, which is the lowest price. If Japanese silk wants to reduce further, it will inevitably suffer significant losses.

<h3>Hull Warns Warmongering Nations; Waging War Will Be Punished; World Nations Must Awaken Quickly</h3>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of State Hull gave a speech to the Campbelan University Alumni Association today, issuing a warning about the danger of current militarism. Without international cooperation to promote peace, understanding, and friendship, this militarism will spread throughout the world. Today, many countries are actively expanding their armaments, plundering the people's wealth, and promoting the spirit of militarism in various ways. Although there are currently no signs of imminent war, there are indeed serious crises in many parts of the world, like a volcano that can erupt at any time. It would be a big mistake and a sin for civilized humanity to remain indifferent to the current dangerous trend. He himself is not disappointed, because he is certain that people all over the world will be able to quickly realize the need to return to the truth. The United States can contribute its valuable services in this regard. In recent months, the United States has contributed wise, sound, and efficient guidance in a considerable program of political, economic, social, and moral revival, and can continue to do so.

<h3>US East Coast Begins Major Naval Maneuvers; Gray Team Attacking, Blue Team Defending</h3>
<p>(Panama) The US Pacific Fleet of 101 ships passed through the Panama Canal in 47 hours from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean for maneuvers. This morning, the fleet sailed out from here to conduct major maneuvers in the Antilles Sea. The team is divided into "Blue" and "Gray" teams. The "Blue" team has a larger number of baskets and a stronger combat force, carrying 1,200 Marines and simulating the transportation of thousands of troops to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, seeking to recapture naval bases such as Culebra and St. Thomas and St. John. The "Gray" team is composed of light and agile warships, and the above-mentioned naval bases are used as targets for the "Gray" team to attack. They are currently being defended. The planned strategy is for the "Gray" team to use submarines to launch torpedoes at night and bomb with aircraft to attack the "Blue" team. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>US Establishes Naval Base in the North Pacific; Sends Ships to Survey Situation; Threatens Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) Six mine-laying ships berthed in Bremerton, the US Pacific Coast naval base in the East Puget Sound naval port, have been ordered to prepare everything and sail to the Aleutian Islands (west of the Alaskan Peninsula, connecting the two continents of America and Asia), where they will study the coastal terrain. Five military seaplanes currently berthed in Seattle will also cooperate with the mine-laying ships. According to the Washington Naval Treaty, the United States can build naval ports in the Aleutian Islands from December 31, 1936. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>If War Breaks Out in the Far East, the US Should Strictly Maintain Neutrality; Warren Suggests Nine New Laws</h3>
<p>(New York) Former Undersecretary of Justice Warren, during the presidency of Wilson, wrote an article for this month's Foreign Affairs Chronicle, advocating the enactment of new laws to maintain American neutrality in the event of a war or war breaking out in the Far East. Warren believes that these new laws should be enacted immediately. He was responsible for implementing American neutrality before the last time the United States participated in the World War. His suggestions are as follows: (1) Manage all coded wireless and submarine cables, not excluding those belonging to foreign diplomats, and prohibit any ships from receiving or transmitting wireless communications in American ports or American territorial waters; (2) Ban the supply of military weapons and heavy fire to belligerent countries from the American side, and prohibit American ships from transporting armaments and ammunition; (3) Ban American citizens from boarding any ships carrying armaments and ammunition or serving as sailors, not excluding armed ships of a defensive nature; (4) Prohibit captured ships from entering American ports; (5) Prevent submarines and aircraft carriers of belligerent countries from entering American ports and territorial waters; (6) Detain merchant ships of belligerent countries that have not been transferred out of American ports within the prescribed time at the outbreak of war; (7) Prohibit belligerent countries' ships that violate international neutrality laws or national neutrality private laws from entering American ports; (8) Prohibit the raising of private debts for belligerents (government public debts have been prohibited by international public law); (9) Prohibit belligerent countries from recruiting soldiers in the United States, whether American citizens or reservists of those countries are prohibited.

<h3>League of Nations Building to Open Next Year; Construction Costs Reach Five Million US Dollars; Attached Library Has Rich Collection</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Building will open next year, and the world's most important international library will also be attached to this new building. The construction cost of the League of Nations new building is five million US dollars. The son of American oil tycoon Rockefeller donated two million US dollars to allow the League of Nations to establish a library and research institute for scholars around the world to explore. Although the library is attached to the League of Nations, it is an independent organization. Half of Rockefeller's donation will be used to build a magnificent building connected to the new conference hall of the League of Nations General Assembly, and the remaining amount will be used as the library's foundation. The library will collect various important international treaties, official gazettes, and books on political, social, economic, and financial issues related to international issues, and will be the only organization to collect government publications and official documents from countries around the world. The new library building can hold one million books. In the thirteen years since its establishment, it has a collection of 180,000 books and adds 20,000 new books every year.

The regular budget has not yet been determined, and it will cost about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per month. As for the entire Mongolian affairs, the central government had a plan to send someone to handle it before January, but it has not been mentioned recently. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister's Yellow Peril Theory; Holding Hidden Concerns for the Future of White People</h3>
<p>Milan The Italian People's Daily published an article today, which seems to be from the hand of Prime Minister Mussolini. The article warned white people that the white race should be regarded as a hidden concern for the future. The article cited a recent book by the French authority scholar Professor Richie, and named its article "The Decline of White Reproduction and the Progress of the Yellow Race." The article stated that "Professor Richie clearly pointed out that the number of yellow people and mixed-race people increased five or six times more than white people. His conclusion is that, assuming that the previous productivity has not changed, Tokyo will become the most populous city in the world in twenty years." (National Telegraph, 5th)</p>
<h3>Italy Cannot Ignore Japan's Expansion of Power; Hiddenly May Suggest Joint Action Against Japan to the Powers</h3>
<p>Rome The Italian political circles regard the explanation made by Japan to the British and American governments regarding its China policy as absolutely unsatisfactory. Several Italian newspapers do not agree with the optimistic attitude of Britain and the United States, thinking that Japan's gradual expansion of power to the Far East and the African continent is worrying. Italy is deeply afraid that Japan will block the development of Italian trade in various parts of the world, and believes that from an international point of view, Japan's attitude is really dangerous. From this, it can be inferred that Italy may suggest joint defense actions against Japan to the powers, which is also unknown. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The "White Daily" reporter in Rome wrote an article on Italy's attitude towards Japan's recent statement on the China incident, saying, "If we do not think deeply, we doubt that the Far East issue is related to Italy so significantly. However, if we consider the various events in recent months, we know that these events are connected and interconnected. When the Asian Students' Congress was held in Rome last December, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech, saying that the mission of world common peace lies in the unity of Rome and Asia. Now, it is even more so. Subsequently, Italian newspapers wrote articles opposing Japan's dumping policy in the world market. On March 18, Mussolini gave a speech to the Pan-Fascist leaders at the National Opera House. Although he claimed that Italy had no ambitions for material aggression, he advocated that Italy should develop its industry and commerce in Africa and Asia. Later, Japan sought to obtain a special permit to grow cotton in Abyssinia in Africa, and also planned to send Japanese noble ladies to marry the Crown Prince of Abyssinia. Italy protested against both of these matters. At the same time, according to the general observation in Rome, Soviet diplomats have been secretly active. The Soviet ambassador to Italy has often deliberately made dangerous remarks to alarm Mussolini. Therefore, people here believe that Japan believes that it has considerable preparations to take decisive action, and even that the leaders of the Tokyo government have determined the date of launching a war. Moreover, since France and Italy's opinions on the main points of European politics have gradually converged, Italy is quite thinking of coordinating with France to expand its power in Asia. Moreover, judging from recent events, Japan and Germany cannot avoid seeking each other's support. The policies of Japan and Germany have many points of integration. Italy is also paying attention to this situation. According to the reliable news obtained from various aspects, the current leaders of the Roman government hold the views that nothing is outside of these. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japan Urgently Prepares for War; Exercises and General Mobilization of Military Industry at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The army must conduct exercises on the mobilization of military industry in order to thoroughly investigate the production of military supplies during wartime, or the maximum capacity of factories and their businesses that can be used for repairs during peacetime. This is scheduled for the end of this month. Order forms will be sent to military supply factories across the country to investigate and train the ability to mobilize military supplies. Starting from July 26 this year, air defense exercises will be held in Osaka for four days. At the same time, exercises on the mobilization of military supplies will also be held. It is heard that military factories for military supplies, clothing, food, etc. must participate in the exercise. The military will issue order forms for military supplies in advance to investigate industrial capacity. At the same time, practical exercises will be carried out on the security of various factories, the control of lights, and rescue work. (Japan Union Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Textile Merchant: Mr. Funatsu Returns Home to Talk; Said that Anti-Japanese Atmosphere in China Has Eased</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Tatsushiro Funatsu, the executive director of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, arrived in Tokyo on the 5th and reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4 p.m. that day on the recent situation of the political and economic circles in China. He then went to the Industrial Club to discuss the recent situation of the anti-Japanese movement and the cotton industry in China as follows:</p>
<p>From a general perspective, the anti-Japanese situation in China has eased quite a bit. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' recent statement on diplomatic relations with China gave it quite an impetus for a time, but the overall anti-Japanese sentiment has recently eased a lot. The economic circles are extremely weak due to the rampant bandits in the interior and frequent natural disasters, so their purchasing power is extremely weak, and commerce is also very exhausted. The cotton industry is also affected by this, and is generally depressed. Chinese textiles have decided to reduce work by 23%. In order to explore sales routes in India, Southeast Asia, and other places, Japanese-owned yarn factories have reduced their work efficiency by a smaller amount than Chinese-owned factories, so the situation is still good. China claims to boycott Japanese goods in order to protect its industry, but this has caused the Chinese economic circles to wither, which is an important reason and can be called a strange phenomenon. The Chinese seem to have realized this, so the anti-Japanese trend has also eased, which is a situation that China and Japan are very happy about. (Japan Union Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<h3>Russo-Polish Non-Aggression Pact; Extended for Ten Years</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The Soviet Union and Poland recently signed a protocol to extend the validity of the non-aggression treaty between the two countries for ten years, until the end of 1945, as in the previous example of the Soviet Union and the Baltic countries. (According to the non-aggression treaty signed between the Soviet Union and the Baltic countries, the original term was three years. An agreement was signed on April 4 this year to extend the validity of the treaty to December 31, 1945.) Political figures here are very pleased to hear the news, saying that the friendship between Russia and Poland and the situation in Eastern Europe have become stable, which can be seen here again.

<h3>Italy Decides to Participate in the World Naval Competition; Decides to Allocate Huge Sums to Build New Ships; Geneva Receives News with Unease</h3>
<p>Rome Italy suddenly announced today that it has decided to follow the United States, Britain, Japan, and France in participating in the world naval competition. According to the order published in the government gazette, the Italian government has allocated an additional 480 million lire as the cost of building new ships. This order will be implemented immediately. This sum will be allocated from the five budgets from 1935 to 1940. (National Telegraph, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Various sectors of the Disarmament Conference expressed their unease today upon receiving the news that Italy had allocated 480 million lire to build new ships, and believed that Italy's actions would have a significant impact on the 1935 naval conference. However, there is still an opinion that Rome's steps are also of great significance for promoting contact before the reopening of the Disarmament Conference. (National Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<h3>Little Entente; Decides to Welcome Cooperation with Italy; Decides But It Must Not Hinder the Interests Permitted by the Treaty; Decides To Strive for a Seat on the Council at the League of Nations Meeting</h3>
<p>(Paris) Czech Foreign Minister Benes told a representative of the Little Daily today that the Czech Republic welcomes Italy's cooperation on the Danube River issue, because the Czech Republic is currently conducting similar cooperation negotiations with Austria, Hungary, and other countries. Benes said that the Czech government has no objection to Italy's actions within its scope, but Italy's power should not exceed a certain scope and should not harm the legal interests of the Little Entente countries. Benes later expressed his opinion on the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations, saying that if the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations becomes a reality, the Little Entente countries should add a seat to the League of Nations Council to represent 47 million people. Benes also said that he personally strongly advocated that the ranking of countries should be abolished, and that the number of permanent seats on the Council should be increased to sixteen or eighteen, with countries or groups of countries as the unit.

<p>Soviet Far East Army Deployment Complete, Ready to Fight if Japanese Army Invades</p>
<p>Standing military strength approximately 150,000 men.</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that over the past year, news of the Soviet Union constructing and strengthening its Far East border defenses has been frequently disseminated abroad. Recently, the London "Times" published a report from a Riga correspondent summarizing this news and discussing the internal atmosphere of Russia and its rulers. In view of the increasing activities of the Japanese in Manchuria and the many unresolved diplomatic issues between the two countries, the report focuses on border defense and is expected to be welcomed by those concerned with the current situation. The report is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet authorities now claim that the double-track railway connecting the European center of Russia with the main force of the Red Army stationed on the Manchurian border has been completed. The Siberian trunk line has been repaired, and the entire line has been double-tracked to the intersection of the China Eastern Railway outside Chita. Only a few bridges and tunnels have yet to be completed. This move is significant. The tone of Soviet leaders regarding negotiations with Japan and the new state of Manchukuo has recently differed from the past, partly due to this. Two years ago, border countries all said that if Japan invaded Russian territory, the Far East Red Army would retreat without a fight, and even Vladivostok and the Maritime Province would not be protected. It would inevitably be abandoned. It was said that the Soviet government actually had no ability to defend its Far East territory. Even the Soviet authorities seemed to acknowledge this. The sale of the China Eastern Railway last year was a sign of their own discouragement. However, the situation has changed dramatically. Even those who do not agree with this view are few and far between. Therefore, if the Soviet Union is attacked in the Far East today, it will undoubtedly fight back.</p>
<p>In 1932, when Japan occupied Manchuria, the Soviet Union was unable to prevent or resist it. The Far East "autonomous" Red Army, commanded by General Galen, was weak and unable to confront the large Japanese army. Moreover, the supply of military equipment depended heavily on European Russia, making transportation difficult due to the distance. In the past two years, the Soviet authorities have actively prepared to remedy this, and have achieved much. The preparation process is divided into two main aspects: (1) improving transportation with central Russia; (2) enabling the Far East Army to be self-sufficient. A large part of the first task has been completed. The railway from Samara to Garymskaya has been double-tracked. The latest engines have been installed on the busiest sections. This year, automatic signal machines were installed on the Wormsk to New Siberian sections to increase the efficiency of those sections. At present, double tracks are being installed on the entire line surrounding the Manchurian border, including Outer Baikal, Amur, and Ussuri. This project has been operated day and night for several months by so-called "class enemies" who have been sentenced to forced labor by Soviet courts. Recently, a portion of the prisoners who were excavating the White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal have been added to the workforce. In total, the number of laborers dedicated to the Far East railway project is approximately 100,000. On April 2, 1932, a "Siberian and Far East Railway Special Department" was established to manage all railway projects from Wormsk to Vladivostok. The general office is located in Irkutsk, and the director is Mr. Kishkin. In 1933, the Soviet Railway Workers Land Transportation Deputy Committee was ordered to receive military training under the control of the Secret Political Investigation Department. Today, the measures taken on the entire Siberian line seem to be more complete than on most Soviet railways. All of these are recent achievements.</p>
<p>As for enabling the Far East Army to be self-sufficient, significant progress has also been made and is gradually being resolved. In 1932, an orderly colonial plan for eastern Soviet territory was drafted. On August 15 of that year, a special "Immigration Committee" was established, headed by Mularov, the former commander of the Moscow Military District, to implement the colonial plan. Last year, unreliable elements in the area near the Manchurian border were completely eliminated, either sent to forced labor camps or allowed to retain freedom of movement outside the designated area. To encourage border loyalty, the Soviet government granted the remaining good residents and new immigrants from European Russia various special rights enjoyed only by those living in Tajikistan, the Soviet Union's so-called "Gateway to India," such as a ten-year exemption from grain taxes in the Far East, a six-year exemption in eastern Siberia, and free trade. In addition, the salaries of industrial laborers, civil and military officials, and soldiers are all higher than in other places. According to recent surveys, the population within the territory is expanding rapidly due to the large number of immigrants, and many new industries have been established, especially in the Baikal Lake and Buryat River regions. A new coal mine has been opened in the Buryat River region, and it is said that its coal production will one day rival the Kuznetsk coal mine. It is hoped that the Far East Army will not be able to completely support itself in the future, but will be able to rely heavily on the aid of the Siberian and Far East agricultural areas and the new industries in the region. In terms of Soviet food supply, Siberia's progress in recent years has been greater than most of the country. Therefore, the grain, meat, and milk produced by the western and eastern Siberian farmland are sufficient to supply the Far East Army without worrying about shortages. The transportation of these supplies will be less dangerous in wartime, and the distance from the main front line stationed in the Baikal River region is not too far, which is also convenient for military operations.</p>
<p>The number of troops in the Far East Army has doubled since 1932. According to highly reliable sources, there are now a total of seven infantry divisions. Three divisions are stationed between Vladivostok and Khabarovsk in the Maritime Province. Another three divisions are stationed elsewhere, ready to fight at any time. Each division is composed of approximately 10,000 officers and soldiers (consisting of three regiments plus one battalion), including ten artillery companies, half of which are mortars. Each regiment also has nine field guns. In addition, each army corps has one heavy artillery regiment. In total, the strength of the Far East standing army, including 10,000 cavalrymen, is now approximately 150,000 men, with more than 50 heavy guns, approximately 500 field guns, a similar number of light mortars, 300-400 light tanks, several heavy tanks, 4,000-5,000 machine guns, and 300-400 aircraft. In addition, there is a special division belonging to the Secret Political Investigation Department stationed near the Manchurian border, and a Mongolian cavalry division stationed in Outer Mongolia, which is organized according to the Soviet military system and commanded by the Soviet Union. An air base has been built in Irkutsk. A chemical plant has been established in Kemerovo, western Siberia, to produce toxic gas. The necessary materials for manufacturing this substance can be obtained locally. It is said that the Soviet military authorities have also transported and stored a large amount of fuel to the Far East. Therefore, although Vladivostok and the Maritime Province are at a disadvantage in defense during wartime, the main force near Chita is strong and capable of invading Manchuria and directly attacking Harbin and the new capital of Manchukuo. The Far East Army's aircraft include approximately 50 heavy bombers capable of reaching the western coast of Japan, but Tokyo and many other important cities are too far away and can avoid the danger of aerial destruction. According to General Galen, the commander-in-chief of the Far East Army, there are currently 130,000 Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria, accounting for one-third of the total strength of the Japanese army, 110,000 Manchukuo soldiers, and 12,000 White Russian guards trained and commanded by the Japanese. It is said that these figures are absolutely accurate. The Far East Red Army is an adjunct to the ordinary Red Army of the Soviet Union. The strength of the ordinary Red Army of the Soviet Union in peacetime, according to official figures, is 562,000 men. The formation of the Far East Red Army does not weaken the Soviet military strength in Europe. Whenever a division is dispatched to the Far East, the officer trainees are left behind, and a new division can be formed to fill the gap and restore the peacetime strength. The infantry division of the European Red Army in peacetime has approximately 6,000 men. The number of people serving in the Red Army is over one million, of which approximately 700,000 are standing soldiers, and the rest are territorial soldiers. In addition, there are special soldiers and border guards belonging to the Secret Political Investigation Department, totaling approximately 200,000 men. According to the current plan, Russia does not need to issue a general mobilization order in the event of war. It only needs to call up several levels of reserves to bring the army from its peacetime organization to its wartime strength. The mechanization of the army is also fully operational and has made great progress. A few weeks ago, Army Commissar Voroshilov announced that the mechanization of the Soviet army has now reached 7.74 horsepower per soldier, which is far beyond the US Army and even exceeds the British Army. At present, the total number of tanks in the Red Army seems to be slightly over 2,000.</p>
<p>The Soviet military equipment is sufficient, but its government spokespersons and the national newspapers still proclaim every day that war is inevitable and that the current period is only a time of respite to allow the Soviet Union to complete the world revolution. Therefore, petitions are issued one after another, either by raising funds from the public or by deducting wages, to raise huge sums for "military bonds," "iron fees," and "military expenses" to continue to increase the Soviet Union's combat power. These declarations and petitions often explain that all military preparations are for defensive purposes. The Soviet Union's desire for peace is now unmatched by anything else. However, although the Soviet Union has signed agreements with neighboring countries, it will inevitably be invaded by others. This kind of disturbance among the Russian people may be partly due to their sincere emotions, or it may only be a means of seeking to bring the defense to a peak.</p>
<p>The Japanese Establish Datong Company in Qingdao to Handle All Procedures for Going to the Pseudo-State</p>
<p>And Issue Certificates to Go to the Pseudo-State</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondent: Japanese residents recently established the Qingdao Office of Datong Company on Enxian Road in this city to handle all procedures for Chinese people going to the pseudo-state and issue certificates for going to the pseudo-state, selling each certificate for 20 cents. Their disregard for our national sovereignty is truly hateful. However, this matter occurred not long ago, and the municipal government sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese Consul General in Qingdao to stop it. The details of the process are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>When the company was first established, it found a building on Enxian Road in this city as an office address and specially sent personnel to various newspapers (Chinese newspapers) to contact them to publish advertisements to attract customers. All newspapers refused to publish them. The company then notified various shipping companies in the city ten days ago, stating that Datong Company is now issuing an entry certificate for coolies going to Andong and Yingkou in Manchuria, which must be prepared. Without this certificate, they will not be allowed to land in Andong and Yingkou. After receiving the letter, each shipping company ignored it because the company was purely a private letter and had no official proof, which was obviously an excuse for private gain. Several days later, each shipping company received another letter from the company, stating that the company plans to start around April 20. If coolies going to Dalian, Andong, Yingkou, etc. do not carry the entry certificate issued by the company, they will not be allowed to land in Dalian, Andong, and Yingkou. Please use the entry certificate issued by the company. Each shipping company still ignored it. Finally, each shipping company received another letter from the company, stating that from April 25, coolies going to Manchuria on Chinese and Japanese ships who do not carry the company's certificate will be inspected separately when they arrive in Dalian. Those who are considered to be a hindrance to public security will be ordered to return to Qingdao on the ship. Please do not raise any objections at that time and please notify each ship. Each shipping company still did not reply. The company, having sent three letters repeatedly without any results, changed its approach and sent a Japanese person to contact each shipping company in person. The managers of each company replied that the company is only responsible for shipping and that whether or not they are allowed to land after arriving at the destination is not related to the company. As for selling entry certificates on behalf of the company, it is difficult to comply because there is no official order. The Japanese person, having failed to get any results, then went to the inn association to contact them, requesting each inn to sell this entry certificate on behalf of the company, but was also rejected.</p>
<p>Having failed to get any results from various contacts, the company still tried to proceed and sent people to the dock to sell certificates on the ships. Anyone traveling to the eastern provinces on Japanese ships (such as the 16th Joint Maru, Fengtian Maru, etc.) was forced to buy them. On April 29, the Xinli ship of Zhengji Shipping Company was about to leave for Dalian. Several Japanese people set up a small table at the dock and posted white banners, openly selling certificates. They also wanted to board the ship to sell them by force, but were rejected by the captain. The Japanese people left in a huff. When this matter was in the brewing stage, the municipal government had already received reports from various parties and immediately reported it to the central government while sending personnel to negotiate with the Japanese consulate, requesting strict prohibition. The Japanese consul also believed that the company's actions were inappropriate and agreed to prohibit them. On April 30, he sent personnel in two cars to the dock to stop them. The company personnel were selling at the dock and were all taken to the Japanese consulate by car. (May 4)</p>
<p>British Merchants Expand Their Power in Tibet, Connecting Religion and Commerce, Guiding and Implementing Cooperation between India and Tibet</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondent: News from Tibet indicates that after the passing of the Dalai Lama, the Silon Kasha Ichan, etc., presided over religious and political affairs, and things were relatively peaceful. Regarding the emergence of the Little Dalai Lama, judging by time, only six months have passed since the Old Dalai Lama passed away, and it is impossible to be reincarnated at this moment. According to religious rules, after the Little Dalai Lama is born, he should be taught the scriptures by the Panchen Lama. Now that the Little Dalai Lama has not yet been born, there is no need for the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet. There are four difficulties in the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet: (1) Tibet is divided into front and back Tibet. Front Tibet supports the Dalai Lama and opposes the Panchen Lama. Although the Dalai Lama has passed away, the power of religious politics is controlled by the Silon Kasha Ichan of the Dalai Lama's faction. Even if the Panchen Lama can return to Tibet, he will have no real power. (2) The Dalai Lama's faction is not satisfied with the Khenpos around the Panchen Lama. The Khenpos must travel with the Panchen Lama. If the Khenpos return to Tibet, the lamas of the Dalai Lama's faction will definitely rise up in opposition. Therefore, before this unspeakable pain is resolved, it will be difficult for the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet. (3) Those who support the Panchen Lama are the lamas of back Tibet. However, back Tibet is mostly Red Sect, and the Panchen Lama is Yellow Sect. The Yellow Sect only has a part of the power in back Tibet. In terms of religion, if the Panchen Lama can return to Tibet, he will only hold a small part of the power of the religious of back Tibet. The great power of front Tibet is still controlled by the figures of the Dalai Lama's faction. (4) Front Tibet is rich in industry, especially the Sera, Drepung, and Ganden monasteries, which are the richest. Each large monastery accommodates an average of 2,000 to 3,000 lamas. The Kang Tibet dispute was caused by the issue of the migration of the lamas of the three major monasteries. Since the Dalai Lama's faction has power in front Tibet, and the property of the Panchen Lama in back Tibet is very limited, and before the Panchen Lama left back Tibet, the figures of the Dalai Lama's faction sealed off and seized the property of the Panchen Lama. If the Panchen Lama returns to Tibet, he will have no power and no property, so it is difficult to set off at this moment. The diplomatic issues in Tibet are also very complicated. When the Dalai Lama was alive, he initially opposed the British and allied with the Russians, but failed. He changed the strategy of abandoning distant alliances and attacking nearby enemies, changing to rejecting the Russians and welcoming the British. On the surface, the British have no special power in Tibet, but trade between India and Tibet is very active. After the passing of the Dalai Lama, Indian merchants further processed Tibetan saffron and green fruits into various foods and sold them in Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, and Xinjiang. Also, due to religious factions, they contacted the Red Sect followers in back Tibet and Qinghai. There are many Red Lamas in back Tibet. Guided by the British, Indians are expanding their religious power in back Tibet. Their planned program is to implement cooperation between India and Tibet through the connection of religion and commerce. As for further political activities, there is currently no way to investigate. (May 3)</p>
<p>Lu Reduces Troops and Streamlines Administration, Li Xuande's Cavalry Regiment Has Been Dismissed, Salaries of Some Councilors and Advisors Have Been Suspended</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondent: Since Liu Guitang's bandit troops have been resolved and Han Fuju has dispelled his intention to resign, Han has gathered military and political figures in recent days to discuss the renewal of Shandong's military and political affairs. It is reported that the detailed measures are still being drafted. The first step is to rectify the troops, and the second step is to promote the renewal of politics. Han Fuju's troops include the 20th Division (Sun Tongxuan), the 22nd Division (Gu Liangmin), the 29th Division (Cao Fulin), the 74th Division (Li Hanzhang), the 81st Division (Zhan Shudang), the Handgun Brigade (Wu Huawen), and the Cavalry Regiment (Li Xuande). In recent years, due to troop deployments and bandit suppression, training has inevitably been neglected. Therefore, Han decided to start promoting training immediately. On May 2, he convened a military education meeting of various division commanders. It is understood that special attention will be paid to the military education corps. In addition to continuing the second phase of the senior officer training class, a separate officer class will be prepared. Education will be adapted to modernization, and talented military scholars will be recruited as instructors. After the grand review of troops stationed in Jinan and other provinces, the troops will be ordered to begin training. On the one hand, military spending will be reduced as much as possible to balance revenue and expenditure. Li Xuande's cavalry regiment was dismissed today (May 3). The Shandong Third Route Army originally had no separate cavalry formation. During Shi Yousan's mutiny last year, his remnants fled to Lu, with approximately 10,000 cavalry and infantry. The infantry was formed into a brigade, commanded by Tang Bangzhi, and assigned to the 81st Division. The cavalry was formed into a brigade, with Li Xuande as the brigade commander. However, Shandong's military pay is only 600,000 yuan per month, allocated by the central government from Shandong's national tax revenue, which is quite insufficient. Therefore, the cavalry brigade was reduced to a cavalry regiment a month ago. After this suppression of Liu bandits, Han believes that the original cavalry companies of each division can be used for reconnaissance, so there is no need to retain the cavalry regiment. Therefore, he decided to dismiss it and distribute the horses and guns to various armies. Li Xuande was transferred to serve as a senior adjutant in the headquarters. The cavalry regiment had approximately 600 men and 600 horses, totaling 1,200 people (because each cavalryman and horse is considered two people and receives the pay of two people). The monthly military pay was over 20,000 yuan. In addition to the two months of pay that had not been received, each soldier was given an extra 15 yuan in gratuity, each platoon leader 50 yuan, and each company commander 100 yuan, all contracted to receive three months of pay. Those from Shaanxi and Gansu who had a longer journey were given an extra 10 yuan in travel expenses. This morning (May 3) at 6:00 AM, Yu Jinghuan, the Chief of the Military Affairs Department of the Headquarters, Li Wuchen, the Chief of the Quartermaster Department, and personnel from the Ordnance and Military Law Departments went to Xinzhuang to begin dismissing the cavalry regiment, calling the roll and paying the wages. The process was completed at 4:00 PM. The soldiers all wanted to return to their hometowns, with the most from Henan, and approximately 90 or so from Shaanxi and Gansu. Each person was issued a discharge certificate, and armored vehicles were dispatched at 5:00 PM to send all the discharged soldiers out of Shandong Province. Those going north were sent to Dezhou, and those going south were sent to Xuzhou, and then ordered to return to their respective hometowns. The 51 officers were unwilling to leave Lu. Han decided to send them to the Military Education Corps for training. This afternoon (May 3) at 7:00 PM, Li Xuande led the officers to the provincial government to meet with Han, reported on the dismissal process, and Han personally instructed them before ordering them to be sent to the Military Education Corps. It is also reported that Peng Guozheng's regiment of the 29th Army of Song Zheyuan's troops did not want to leave Feng Yuxiang after following him to Lu. Because Feng had no military pay, he asked Han to maintain them temporarily. Recently, Kaiji was compiled into the Third Regiment of the Handgun Brigade. It is reported that Han also decided to abolish it because there was no money to pay the soldiers.</p>
<p>Also, it is said that Han Fuju decided to reduce redundant personnel and cut expenses to implement austerity in order to make up for the huge deficit in Shandong Province's financial budget for this year. He started with the councilors and advisors of the provincial government. Starting from May 1, he selectively suspended the payment of salaries to some, totaling 18 people, which can save more than 3,500 yuan per month and more than 40,000 yuan per year. The names of the councilors and advisors whose salaries were suspended this time and their monthly salaries are listed below: 17 Councilors: Zhang Qunxin (300 yuan), Wang Xuezhi (400 yuan), Pei Mingyu (150 yuan), Sha Yuebo (200 yuan), Xu Yintang (136 yuan), Zhao Tingxuan (200 yuan), Zhang Rukui (200 yuan), Wang Yuting (100 yuan), Feng Fuguang (100 yuan), Wang Zijiang (150 yuan), Guan Conglong (100 yuan), Yu Qingpan (100 yuan), Ma Jizu (150 yuan), Zhao Liantang (100 yuan), Li Jizhang (120 yuan), Zhang Zuomin (200 yuan), Zhao Zhenhong (200 yuan). 1 Advisor: Duan Yuchun (400 yuan).

<p>Six Years of Bloody Scars, Jinan Cries for May Third Every Year</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondent: In the spring of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army came to Jinan under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese. On May 3, they openly opened fire, killing our compatriots and occupying our city. Now, six years have passed. The old shame has not been washed away, and the bloody scars are everywhere. The four northeastern provinces have been lost again, with no hope of recovery. Touching the past, I want to cry but have no tears. The central government previously believed that there were too many national humiliation memorial days in May, so it merged the May 3 memorial with the May 9 memorial. The provincial party headquarters of this province believes that May 3 occurred in Jinan, which is different from other provinces, so it still holds the memorial as usual. On this day, the whole city flew flags at half-mast to mourn the martyrs who were killed. Entertainment venues were all closed, and banquets were also stopped. Although it was the late spring season, with flowers and willows in full bloom, paper ashes were flying and cries could be heard everywhere, making for an extremely tragic scene. The Provincial Public Security Bureau was afraid of disturbances and increased the number of guards. All schools held memorial meetings individually, mourning the martyrs and suspending classes for one day. Administrative agencies still went to work as usual. The Provincial Party Headquarters gathered representatives from various agencies, groups, and schools at 9:00 AM to hold a memorial meeting. More than 500 people attended. A three-foot-high and one-foot-wide spiritual tablet was set up at the meeting, inscribed with "The Spiritual Tablet of the Martyrs Killed in the May 3 Massacre." Zhang Weicun, the Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, presided over the meeting and performed the ceremony. Zhang Weicun reported on the May 3 Massacre, followed by a speech by Wang Qingyun, the Secretary of the Provincial Government. The entire audience was filled with grief and indignation. The meeting ended with slogans. (May 3)</p>

<p>Liuzhou and Guilin Under Construction, Written by Lizhai from Nanning</p>
<p>This reporter traveled north from Nanning for a ten-day trip to Liuzhou and Guilin to conduct a more detailed investigation of the various construction projects in Liuzhou and Guilin. Now that it has been completed and returned to Yong, I am writing down what I have learned from interviews and listening during these ten days by the light of the lamp for the reference of those who are interested in building Guangxi.</p>
<p>It is 675 li from Nanning to Liuzhou by road. At 7:00 AM on April 12, this reporter, accompanied by several counselors from the headquarters, set off in the misty spring rain and smoky haze. The mountains along the way rise and fall, and the land is mostly barren. At 10:00 AM, we crossed Kunlun Pass (where Song Di Qing once crossed this pass and defeated Nong Zhigao), and then had lunch in Luxu. We continued to drive to Qianjiang, crossed the Hongshui River, and passed through Beisi, Datang, and Liu Dao before arriving in Liuzhou. It was already 5:00 PM, and the evening was vast. The next day, Deputy Adjutant Luo was sent by the 7th Army to guide us to visit various places. The following report is the result of the efforts of the 13th and 14th.</p>
<p>Liuzhou is an important area in Guangxi, connecting the Qian Province to the northwest along the Honghe River, reaching the West River to the southeast via Xiang Xun, connecting Guiquan to the north, and Yonglong to the south. Geographically, it occupies the shape of the entire province and is the location of the 7th Army Headquarters, the Militia Training District Brigade, the Aviation Military Academy, the Machinery Factory, the Alcohol Factory, and the Provincial Reclamation and Water Conservancy Pilot Zone (that is, the large-scale state-run agricultural area). Therefore, in terms of politics, military affairs, and industry, Liuzhou is of sufficient importance to the entire Guangxi. Therefore, a few years ago, the Guangxi authorities had a proposal to designate Liuzhou as the new center of the entire province and delineated a new urban area across the river from the old urban area, and planned to use 8 million yuan for the construction of the new urban area. Unfortunately, due to the volatile political situation and repeated wars, the original plan could not be realized. However, in the recent two or three years, due to the stability of the Guiju and the efforts of the authorities to govern, various construction projects in Liuzhou have also made great progress. According to Commander Liao (Lei), the various reforms in Liuzhou have always had a feeling that strength and wish are contrary to each other due to the economic status of Guangxi. However, the wasteland within 50 li around has been almost completely reclaimed in the past two years, and the depression of the market after the great fire of the 19th year of the Republic of China has gradually recovered its former appearance. In the morning of the 13th, we visited Liuhou Park. The park was expanded from the Liuhou Temple, which enshrines Liu Zongyuan, a literary master of the Tang Dynasty. The Liuhou Temple is on the right side of the park and has been repaired after repeated wars. Even if it is not the old view, it is now desolate. In the central niche of the temple is a stone carving of Liu Zihou's image. On the left, there are the remains of the Han Changli and Su Dongpo books, and the sacrificial words of the Luo Chi Temple Stele of Liuhou are still embedded in the dilapidated wall. Although it has been copied countless times, it has already shown traces of peeling and scars, but the vigorous and majestic spirit still fills the lines. The formal visit began in the afternoon of the 13th, starting with:</p>
<p>Guangxi Machinery Factory: The factory site is more than ten li away from the new urban area of Liuzhou. It was founded in the 16th year of the Republic of China. The initial plan was linked to the construction policy of taking Liuzhou as the new center of Guangxi, that is, to take the machinery factory as the center of the heavy industry of Guangxi, with the purpose of casting the machines required for agriculture and industry to promote large-scale agricultural reclamation and industrial manufacturing. Therefore, the horsepower reached 900 horsepower, and the start-up cost was more than 400,000 yuan. Unfortunately, due to the prosperity of military affairs from the 17th to the 20th year, the original plan became mostly a bubble. The factory currently employs more than 80 workers, divided into smelting, sand casting, mechanical installation, and woodworking production rooms. The annual expenditure is about 300,000 yuan (excluding the cost of special materials). The manufacturing technology can install and repair aircraft and machine guns and cast</p>

<p>Health Bureau Expands Citywide Health Campaign Organization, Seeking Assistance from Twenty-One Agencies in Promotion and Requesting Assistance from the Medical Association for Injections and a Grand Parade</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, considering the arrival of summer and the particular importance of the city's health work, and to promote public attention and the vigorous implementation of the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang, has specially prepared to hold a citywide health campaign conference. It held its first preparatory meeting a few days ago. It has been learned that the bureau has expanded the scope of the health campaign, designated twenty-one participating groups, and plans to hold a grand parade for preventive injections. Details of each matter are recorded below:</p>
<p>Expanding the Scope of the Organization</p>
<p>To ensure the health campaign is based on practical results, the Health Bureau has decided to expand the organization. The municipal government has stipulated the participating agencies, including the Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, Public Security Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Chinese Society for the Protection of Children, Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association, YMCA, YWCA, Chinese Medical Association, Medical Association, Journalists Association, Sanitation Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Public Concession Works Department, Health Department, French Concession Works Department, and Health Department, totaling twenty-one agencies. All of the above agencies can assist with the health campaign. For example, the participation of the health departments of the two concessions will help promote the health campaign within the concessions, the Journalists Association will be responsible for publicity, and the Public Security Bureau will assist with public order. All are extremely important. The preparatory committee has already sent letters seeking assistance.</p>
<p>Injection and Prevention Parade</p>
<p>The health campaign conference has been decided to be held on the 11th, 12th, 18th, 19th, 25th, and 26th of this month, a total of six days, at three locations: the Nanshi Daji Road Public Sports Field, the Chinese Sports Field, and the city center area. In addition to determining the key points of the health campaign's publicity, a grand parade for preventive injections is also planned. The method has been decided that the conference will prepare the injection medication, and the Medical Association will be asked to send a large number of doctors to assist in the injections. On the day of the grand parade, vehicles will be prepared to circulate throughout the city, and injections will be given to anyone on the road. In particular, rickshaw pullers must be strongly encouraged to receive injections, as they are busy pulling rickshaws all day and have no time to pay attention to prevention. Once they develop an epidemic, it is difficult to treat and easily spread. Regarding other relevant groups, factories, schools, and the intellectual class will also be given extensive publicity to ensure that all citizens of the city pay attention to public health.</p>
<h3>Impersonation and Fraud by an Accomplice - Chen Jinquan Arrested Yesterday - Only a Hundred Yuan Missing from the Original Sum</h3>
<p>Regarding the incident a few days ago in which Chen Jinquan, a partner at the Da Shun Candle Shop on the corner of Dongjiadu Road in Nanshi, fraudulently obtained a large sum of money from Tongxingzhuang by claiming to exchange banknotes and then absconded, the candle shop immediately ordered its partners to search everywhere after the incident. They also extensively inquired about Chen Jinquan's usual friends and relatives. Around 9 PM in the evening, they found Chen Jinquan's cousin, Chen Amao, a fishmonger living at No. 5 in Yongpingli, Yalu Road, Sikaziqiao, Hongkou. They learned that Chen Jinquan had come here around 6 PM that afternoon and left a suitcase. The partners asked Chen Amao if there was any cash in the suitcase, and Amao replied that he did not know for sure and could open the box to check. The partners immediately opened the suitcase and found the missing cash inside. Upon counting, it was discovered that he had spent one hundred yuan, leaving only three thousand nine hundred yuan. As they had obtained the truth, the partners immediately ordered someone to inform Tongxingzhuang to come and wait for the person. Around 10 AM yesterday morning, Chen Jinquan indeed arrived, and they immediately stepped forward, seized him, and proceeded according to the law. It is reported that Hu Gengsheng, who was suspected of being involved and taken to the police station, has been cleared as the truth has now come to light. Tongxingzhuang has prepared a letter of guarantee and apology.</p>
<h3>The Case of Counterfeit Camel Brand Combs Raises Jurisdictional Issues - Xia Minghui's Portion Adjourned for Retrial</h3>
<p>Yang Songmei, the owner of Yang Yongchun Optical Shop at No. 1 Yuanchengli, Lafayette Road in the French Concession, and his salesman Zhu Zhishao, purchased a large number of counterfeit Camel Brand combs, falsely claiming to be managed by the American Asiatic Trading Company, from Japan and sold them to various shops. After being discovered by the American Asiatic Company, they reported to the Old Gate Police Station, which ordered detectives to seize more than three dozen combs at Wanxiang Department Store, No. 188 Yunnan Road. Later, Yang and Zhu were arrested, and more than four thousand combs were confiscated. They were handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday was the date for the continued hearing. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu also prosecuted Xia Minghui, the owner of Wanxiang Shop, in the same case. Liu was the first defendant. Yang's lawyer raised the issue of jurisdiction, stating that Yang and Zhu's crime locations and residences were all within the French Concession, and the Second Special Court should be the court of jurisdiction. However, the police lawyer argued that the initial discovery of the case was at Wanxiang, so it was indeed a related case, and according to Article 14 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the court had jurisdiction. After review by Judge Huang Risheng, it was ruled that the jurisdiction over Yang and Zhu's portion of the case was incorrect and should be transferred to the Second Special District Court for investigation. Xia Minghui's portion was adjourned for retrial. Lawyer Qian expressed dissatisfaction with the ruling and stated that he would appeal. The court then ordered Yang and Zhu to each post their original bail of one thousand yuan during the appeal period.</p>

<h3>Dong Luyuan's Sentence Reduced to Imprisonment After Appeal</h3>
<p>Dong Luyuan (nicknamed "Little Pockface"), a local resident of No. 74 Miezhu Street outside the Dadongmen in Nanshi, is nineteen years old. His parents have passed away, leaving behind tens of thousands of yuan in real estate, which is managed by his elder brother. Dong, due to his inclination towards a lower lifestyle, dropped out of school and spent his time wandering with a group of hooligans. In October of last year, he developed an ambiguous relationship with Qian Abao, a nineteen-year-old woman from Huzhou living on the third floor of the Bajiao Shop at No. 585 French Avenue. During their passionate romance, Dong gave her a small gold thread ring worth ten yuan. By the Lunar New Year this year, Dong knew that she had found a new love and was cold towards him. He became extremely jealous and, unable to open his mouth to question her, went to her residence on the afternoon of February 17th to borrow two yuan, which he was unsuccessful in doing. That evening, he gathered several hooligans and went to her residence, forcibly demanding the return of the gold ring he had given her and verbally and physically abused her. The woman, unable to bear the humiliation, jumped from the balcony in a moment of desperation, resulting in broken leg bones and several lost teeth. Dong and the others fled in a panic. Later, the woman's mother, Qian Yang, sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the police station, which arrested Dong and handed him over to the Second Special District Court, which filed a public prosecution for crimes such as gang robbery and intimidation. The woman's mother, Qian Yang, also hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution seeking compensation for her daughter's injuries, disability, medical expenses, and lifelong emotional distress, totaling 14,760 yuan. After the trial, Dong Luyuan was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 500 yuan for intimidation. The accompanying civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court for trial. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. Subsequently, Dong, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired lawyers Wu Peng, Xue Jiaqi, and Li Yuan to appeal to the High Third Branch. After the trial, the court found that the original sentence was too heavy and, on the previous day, sentenced him to three months in prison and fined him 500 yuan for the same crime. It is reported that Dong expressed his obedience in court, abandoned the appeal, and will be sent to prison soon.</p>

<h3>Reducing Freight Rates for Pigs and Grain</h3>
<p>The freight rate for pigs is reduced by 25% according to the prescribed rate. The original deadline was the end of December of the 22nd year, but the Ministry of Railways has approved the extension of this period for another year. In addition, the Ministry of Railways, to relieve rural areas and regulate food supply, ordered the reduction of grain freight rates to the lowest limit. It was discussed that barley, corn, five kills (except as otherwise specified), sorghum, small materials, millet, wheat (except as otherwise specified), rye, grain, etc. should be changed to be charged at the fifth grade, minus 15%. This was approved by the ministry and has been tried out for six months since February 1st of this year. However, the special price of one yuan and seven cents per ton for the entire vehicle of wheat and rice (except as otherwise specified) transported from Wuxi to the Shanghai North Station or Mackinnon Road on the Beijing-Shanghai route will be temporarily suspended. If the above-mentioned grain price reduction is not continued after the six-month period expires, it will be restored.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Extend the Storage Period of Goods at Mackinnon Road Warehouse</h3>
<p>The free storage period for goods stored in the warehouse was originally limited to 24 hours, but at the request of customers, it was extended to seven days, and the amount of overdue storage fees was appropriately reduced. However, in the autumn and winter of last year, due to the full Mackinnon Road warehouse, in order to clear the congestion, the seven-day period was temporarily changed to five days from November 3rd. The overdue storage fee for goods of the fourth grade and below was also temporarily charged at the storage rate for third-grade goods (five cents of silver per ton per day). The accumulated goods this year are slightly less congested, and some customers have said that five days is too short. Therefore, the seven-day period has been restored, and the storage fee for fourth-grade and below goods</p>

<p>Economic Supplement, Published Every Monday</p>
<p>A Prospectus for the Third National Inspection Conference  By Lian Lin</p>
<p>Commodity inspection has a dual purpose. On the negative side, it aims to prevent the import of inferior foreign goods, especially agricultural products infested with pests, so as not to harm domestic goods. On the other hand, it aims to prohibit the export of inferior domestic goods in order to safeguard the credit of domestic goods in overseas markets and avoid disputes arising from the quality of exported goods. However, the purpose of commodity inspection is by no means limited to this. It also has a positive aspect, namely to promote the improvement of domestic commodities and the development of international trade.</p>
<p>Commodity inspection policies arise with the development of international trade. In Europe and the United States, they have only a few decades of history. In China, the history is even shorter, only five years in total. During these five years, commodity inspection bureaus have been established in Shanghai, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Tianjin, marking an important page in the history of China's international trade. However, on the one hand, the time is short, and on the other hand, due to the lack of clarity among merchants and the public regarding the nature of inspection policies, many matters still inevitably encounter obstacles. The administrative authorities are also aware of this, so in order to improve the effectiveness of inspection policies, two national inspection conferences have been held in the past. Reviewing past proposals and their implementation, it cannot be said that perfection has been achieved. Therefore, a third national inspection conference will be convened on May 7th of this year.</p>
<p>Regarding the third national inspection conference convening on May 7th, we naturally hold great expectations from the perspective of developing international trade and improving the effectiveness of inspection policies. While the conference itself may lack practical power and its future effectiveness depends on the efforts of those who implement its decisions, the agenda of this conference should not only focus on the technical aspects of inspection, but also consider the following points:</p>
<p>First, Changing the Understanding and Application of Inspection Policies</p>
<p>Ordinary people understand commodity inspection simply as the determination of whether commodities are qualified for import and export. In fact, this seemingly simple process can have very different meanings depending on the user. In the past, China's inspection policies inevitably followed a simple path. However, due to changes in the times and objective needs, it is necessary to change the understanding and application of the nature of inspection policies.</p>
<p>For example, everyone agrees that China needs to implement a controlled economy to develop its economic construction. Under the premise of a controlled economy, international trade must be controlled, that is, state-operated. However, due to the complexity of the objective environment, achieving complete control is not possible in a short period. However, in order to adapt to local conditions and gradually implement the policy, commodity inspection is the best tool for promoting economic control and trade control. Under a controlled economy, there are fixed limits on the quantity of goods imported and exported, and fixed standards for the quality of goods. Commodity inspection can not only enforce regulations on commodity quality but can also, to a certain extent, enforce restrictions on the quantity of goods imported and exported.</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider the revitalization of rural areas. Everyone knows that the first step in revitalizing China's rural areas is to prevent the dumping of imported agricultural products. The purpose of implementing dumping taxes and taxes on imported foreign rice is precisely this. However, while the dumping tax law is difficult to implement for the time being, its effectiveness is not as great as commodity inspection in preventing the dumping of imported agricultural products. If commodity inspection is used to restrict the import of foreign agricultural products, the quality standards can be raised, especially by implementing inspection for diseases and pests in imported agricultural products, ensuring that imported agricultural products do not pose a threat to domestic agriculture in terms of disease transmission and do not harm the sales of domestic agricultural products in the market.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is the fundamental policy of China's commodity inspection, and it awaits concrete and careful definition by this conference.</p>
<p>Second, Deliberation on the Commodity Inspection Law</p>
<p>On December 14, 1932, the National Government promulgated the Commodity Inspection Law, consisting of nineteen articles, providing a set of regulations for both the administrative authorities and merchants to follow. This unification based on the law by all bureaus is indeed commendable. However, this law has a significant impact on the future of inspection policies and was drafted in 1932. As mentioned above, when the state's new economic construction policies are implemented and fundamental changes are made to the direction of inspection policies, it is necessary to deliberate on this law first.</p>
<p>Even in the current situation, the Commodity Inspection Law itself has many aspects that can be deliberated on. For example, Article 5 of the law states:</p>
<p>"Foreign commodities that are subject to inspection and hold inspection certificates from the government of the exporting country may be exempted from inspection on a reciprocal basis. However, if discrepancies are found between the goods and the original certificate, inspection is still required." This does not reflect the fundamental spirit of inspection policies. First, commodity inspection is not like a tariff agreement with principles of reciprocity. Even under the principle of reciprocity, while China's exported goods may not be subject to inspection in the reciprocal country, the export of inferior goods may still lead to disputes between merchants due to quality issues. This certainly does not reflect the goal of improving commodity quality and enhancing international reputation that inspection policies are meant to achieve. Second, exempting imported goods from inspection due to reciprocal relations can lead to serious abuses, especially in the case of agricultural diseases and pests that are highly infectious. For example, (as reported by the Nanjing Central Daily News in 1931) "Bees imported from Japan are allowed entry based solely on the Japanese Beekeeping Association's uniform disease-free certificates. Due to the large number of imports, inferior bee colonies have been mixed in, resulting in losses exceeding 3 million yuan for our country. Among bee diseases, foulbrood is the most severe, and its pathogens often lurk in old combs. Once transmitted, the entire apiary is at risk of being destroyed." Article 7 of the law states:</p>
<p>"Inspection fees may be collected for inspected commodities, and the fee amount shall be determined separately by the Ministry of Industry for each commodity, but shall not exceed three per thousand of the commodity's market price." Commodity inspection is different from tariffs, and commodity inspection bureaus should not be equated with tax collection agencies. According to practices in Europe and the United States, the state provides a specific budget for inspection, and most inspected commodities are not subject to fees. The need to collect fees for commodity inspection in China should only be seen as a temporary measure under the current financial constraints. However, even in terms of fee collection, it should not be calculated as a percentage of the value like taxation but should be based on the quantity of the commodity and the complexity of the inspection procedures. Article 6 of the law states:</p>
<p>"If the packaging of a commodity is altered without the approval of the commodity inspection bureau after the inspection certificate has been issued, the commodity shall be re-inspected." In fact, as long as the inspection is合格， and there is no violation of Article 15, which stipulates "Those who unauthorized alter the quantity or mix in inferior goods after commodity inspection," it does not seem appropriate to impose additional demands. For example, if sugar imported into Shanghai has passed inspection by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, and the packaging must be changed for transportation and sale inland, requiring re-inspection would only burden the people.</p>
<p>All these points deserve further deliberation. Although this conference does not have the power to change legislation, the resulting discussions will certainly provide a valuable reference for legislative authorities, making it possible to further improve the Commodity Inspection Law.</p>
<p>Third, Areas for Improvement in Current Inspection Policies</p>
<p>Even regarding the current situation, there are many aspects of commodity inspection that urgently need improvement. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>First, although there are already five commodity inspection bureaus nationwide, located in important trading ports, and each bureau has attached branch offices, commodity inspection agencies are still not widespread, and neither is inspection at the place of origin. This situation often results in unequal treatment for merchants exporting goods nationwide. In some places, imported goods must be inspected, while in others, they do not. The same applies to the import of inferior goods: goods that cannot be imported or exported in one port can be imported or exported elsewhere. A comprehensive plan for the national inspection system should be developed, and the state should actively expand it to achieve the goal of a national commodity inspection system.</p>
<p>Second, while there are many commodities that are subject to inspection, most are still not inspected. For example, plant pest and disease inspection, which is urgently needed, is still lacking. The number of imported goods that are subject to inspection is even smaller.</p>
<p>Third, the commodity inspection standards of commodity inspection bureaus in various regions should be unified, and standards for commodity grading should be established as soon as possible so that all bureaus can follow the same standards. Grading standards for various important food crops, such as rice and wheat, should be established as soon as possible to provide merchants with guidelines. This would not only avoid many unnecessary disputes in trade but also improve the quality of food crops.</p>
<p>These are merely a few humble suggestions. It is hoped that this conference will surpass the previous two and achieve positive results, guiding China's inspection policies towards a sound path under a comprehensive plan and achieving its ultimate goals.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Implementing Plant Pest and Disease Inspection   By Nai Gong</h3>
<p>Plant pest and disease inspection was first established in Germany, followed by France, Austria, and Switzerland. The United States has only implemented it for over twenty years. Today, almost all countries in the world implement plant pest and disease inspection. However, in our country, it is still lacking, and we have unknowingly become a dumping market for low-quality plants worldwide. Trade losses are significant, and the damage from introduced pests and diseases is even greater. All sorts of pests and diseases, such as the pink bollworm, nematodes, and corn smut, have been introduced from overseas. Recently, the spread of pests has been quite rampant, with almost no place spared. The losses to agriculture are beyond our imagination. Other pests and diseases that have not yet been introduced but have the potential to be introduced are also a cause for concern. Take the boll weevil, for example, which is extremely rampant in the United States, causing annual losses of 200 to 400 million gold dollars. Farmers are suffering, and they can only lament their helplessness. If it were to be introduced into China, the future of the cotton industry would be unthinkable. Furthermore, pests and diseases introduced from other regions are often more virulent than in their place of origin. This is because the environments and climates differ in each country. Pests and diseases in their place of origin are often controlled by natural enemies and climate, or their hosts have strong resistance, preventing them from becoming rampant. Once moved to a foreign land, they lose their natural balance, often causing great disasters. Examples include the citrus mealybug introduced into France from China and the grape downy mildew introduced into France from the United States. However, this only addresses the prevention of foreign pests and diseases. In terms of foreign trade, China's exports of cotton have no legally mandated inspection certificates, resulting in alarming losses year after year. Because farmers are ignorant of pest and disease prevention measures, cotton exports are often infested with pests and diseases. These are often rejected by inspection agencies in other countries, either completely destroyed or ordered to be returned to their place of origin. Some countries even use the excuse of dangerous pests and diseases to ban the import of important plant products from China. The table below should make this clear. The following is a list of plant species from China that are prohibited by various countries: (Sweden) Living elm plants. (Denmark) Spruce and elm trees. (Mexico) Seeds.

<p>Modern nations often use inspection policies to prevent the import of foreign plants. The reasons given on the surface are always justifiable, using science as a shield. However, a closer examination reveals that they are all engaging in scheming and pursuing their own interests. They are extremely strict with the inspection of imported plants, but deeply fear simplifying the procedures for inspecting exported plants. This cycle of retaliation has led to the current situation of opposing inspection barriers. The design is elaborate, but what about hindering international trade? The purpose of plant inspection is to protect domestic agricultural production and enhance the credibility of exported plants. This is aboveboard and beyond reproach, but to achieve satisfactory results, world cooperation must be sought under the principle of adhering to inspection principles, and trade barriers must be eliminated. Prohibited species should be carefully considered, and inspection procedures should be unified. Otherwise, each country will act independently based on its own position, and acts of harming others to benefit oneself will emerge endlessly, leading to an increasingly acute war of international trade. This is greatly contrary to the original purpose of inspection and should be deeply noted by the authorities of each country. Our country's inspection efforts have made considerable progress since 1929. In the past five years, specialized bureaus have been established in the trading ports of Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Qingdao to implement commodity inspection matters. Merchants have found it convenient, and opinions have been generally favorable. Among them, the measures taken by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau have particularly attracted international attention. Unfortunately, the items inspected by each bureau are still few, and the commodities subjected to import inspection are only a few items such as fertilizers, liquor, and sugar. Now, at a time when the call for rural revival is being chanted loudly, plant pest and disease inspection is an even more urgent task. Otherwise, the position of Chinese plants in the international market will soon be completely lost, and at the same time, the introduction of dangerous foreign pests and diseases will further plunge agriculture into an abyss of no return. Looking ahead, we cannot help but shudder. In the future, it is hoped that the government and the people will stand on the same front, fighting together, on the one hand, carefully considering the state of domestic production, decisively prohibiting or restricting the import of foreign plants, and on the other hand, rigorously enforcing export inspection so that Chinese plants can obtain equal trading opportunities in the international market. This is a special measure to cope with the economic aggression of imperialism, and it is also a strategy that China, which is bound by tariff agreements, should adopt. It is hoped that this will not be dismissed as an ordinary issue.</p>
<h3>Remedying Green Tea Coloring Inspection  By Lu Hui</h3>
<p>Green tea is one of China's special products, and its foreign trade extends to the United States, France, the Philippines, Russia, and other places, with the United States being the main market. As early as the period from 1880 to 1900, China's green tea sales to the United States consistently reached a massive 300,000 to 400,000 dan [a unit of weight], renowned throughout the United States. The foundation was so deep that no other country's product could hope to rival it. The reason why American people favored Chinese tea was that Chinese green tea was of clean quality, not only fragrant but also of delicate flavor, making drinkers feel pleasant and having the effect of cleansing the stomach, invigorating the spirit, and benefiting the human body. However, from the beginning of the 20th century until recent years, green tea sales to the United States have greatly declined. By 1927, they had fallen to just over 80,000 dan. At the same time, Japanese green tea was selling well in the United States. There are many reasons for this, but the "coloring" of Chinese tea is the biggest reason. The American authorities believed that it was detrimental to health and issued an order in 1910 prohibiting its import, thus ending its presence in the American market.</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese green tea was known for its beauty in color, fragrance, and taste, and its fresh and clear appearance was all due to excellent picking and manufacturing. This was something that Japanese products could not compare to. However, in recent years, tea farmers have mostly viewed tea cultivation as a sideline, and due to their lack of knowledge, they have adhered to old methods, cultivating carelessly, picking untimely, and degrading the roasting process, allowing the tea quality to deteriorate. They even resorted to counterfeiting and adulteration, selling inferior goods at high prices. Tea merchants also focused on profits, without asking whether the quality was pure or not, simply using "coloring" to decorate its beauty. Over time, this became an open secret, practiced everywhere, without regard to destroying the overseas reputation of green tea and committing suicide.</p>
<p>As green tea sales to the United States greatly decreased, efforts were made to develop the newly opened African market. As a result, the "coloring" issue also attracted significant attention there. Although it was not banned, the restrictions on "coloring agents" were extremely strict. In 1932, France issued a decree prohibiting the import of tea leaves with toxic coloring agents. Other countries, such as Russia, which was traditionally the largest customer for Chinese tea, have also recently turned to Japan for green tea. All of these things were caused by "coloring." Japan, aware of the times, has been urging improvements in production, expanding tea plantations, rigorously implementing inspection for export, and improving quality, thereby enhancing its reputation day by day. It also used most of the inspection fees for foreign publicity and promotion, and as a result, it seized the great market of Chinese tea in the United States. Other countries, such as India, Ceylon, and Java, have also spared no effort in promoting cultivation, improving quality, strictly enforcing inspection, and promoting abroad, all competing to be the best. Looking back at our country, the situation is bleak, following old habits. If this continues, not only will green tea be abandoned by all parties, but other types of tea will also be affected, and the entire foreign trade of Chinese tea is likely to be cut off.</p>
<p>In view of this, the government, in the year following the establishment of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau (1930), ordered the preparation of tea inspection. Inspection began in the spring of 1931. At the beginning of implementation, the export of "colored" tea was prohibited to save the situation. However, since the production and sales of colored tea had a long history, and some green tea consuming countries overseas had also developed a habit of drinking it, a sudden ban would inevitably disrupt supply and demand. Therefore, the bureau, in consideration of the situation of merchants, submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to adopt a gradual ban, designating certain places, such as the United States, as absolutely prohibited from being shipped to. The African regions were still allowed to be sold for a certain period of time. However, at the beginning of the implementation of this method, some worried that it would affect green tea exports. In the two years since, the quantity has clearly increased. The effectiveness of the inspection policy cannot be foreseen by short-sighted eyes. Recently, it was heard that the bureau's policies have two goals:</p>
<p>(1) Formulate coloring standards for tea leaves. Formulate coloring standards for green tea and send them to the tea industry, so that producers can manufacture according to the standards and sellers can purchase according to the standards, gradually reducing the color over the years, with the goal of prohibiting it in the near future, so that both producers and consumers can benefit.</p>
<p>(2) Regulate the coloring agents used in tea production. There are many types of coloring agents used in tea production in various places, only seeking beautiful coloring, and mostly not questioning whether the quality is pure, resulting in many abuses. According to the bureau's collection of commonly used coloring agents for colored tea on the market and the results of chemical tests, there are more than 20 types, such as sand green (containing a compound of arsenic and copper) and three-fish yellow (containing lead chromate, a toxic substance), which are indeed unhygienic for drinking. Therefore, experts were hired to conduct careful research, and they recently invented several improved alternative coloring agents, which have been given to Chinese and foreign tea merchants for trial use. All agree that the quality is excellent and cannot be compared to commonly used ones. The advantages are that the adhesion and coverage are better than old coloring agents, the color is bright and vibrant, allowing a small amount to achieve the coloring purpose, and the natural color, aroma, and taste of tea leaves are not changed in any way. It is now heard that the industry has been entrusted to the Shanghai Tea Industry Association to set up a factory to manufacture and supply to tea merchants in various places. According to the above two methods, with coloring standards and uniform coloring agents, this solution during the transition period is very convenient for the tea industry.</p>
<p>Now, the third national inspection conference is being held in the capital, with experts gathering to discuss the promotion of inspection policies. It is believed that the decline of China's rural economy and the poor sales of agricultural products are major factors. The purpose of inspection policies is to seek the development of foreign trade. Looking at the domestic industry and commerce, which are in dire straits, the situation is bleak, the most so ever. Therefore, how important is what this conference expects for remedying these problems and reversing the decline?</p>
<p>Tea naturally has its own color. If producers can pick and manufacture properly, why do they need to "color" it? "Coloring" is nothing but deceit. Moreover, the coloring agents are complex and unhygienic. International credibility will inevitably plummet, and foreign trade will inevitably decline day by day. In addition, emerging tea-producing countries such as Japan, India, and Ceylon are seizing the opportunity to encroach, defame, and entice, doing everything possible to prevent Chinese tea from gaining a foothold in foreign markets. Therefore, I deeply wish that the third conference will awaken the tea industry to the need for vigilance. Hesitation and indecision are not appropriate in the trade war. It is essential to comply with the regulations, purchase improved coloring agents based on the "coloring" standards, and manufacture and sell tea, gradually reducing the color each year and restoring the inherent natural color, so that consumers in various countries can fundamentally recognize the characteristics of Chinese green tea and recover lost ground. On the other hand, efforts should be made to improve production techniques such as cultivation and manufacturing, enhance the color, aroma, and taste, and widely publicize abroad so that green tea exports can be easier. The competition from tea industries in emerging countries such as Japan, India, and Ceylon will not be deeply feared. All of this awaits the determination of fundamental policies at this conference.</p>
<h3>On Animal Quarantine  By Zhong Ying</h3>
<p>European and American countries inspect imported animals such as horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, and wild animals through quarantine agencies to prevent the spread of animal diseases. The establishment of commodity inspection agencies in our country has been several years now, but this measure has not yet been implemented. It is hoped that today's opening of the National Inspection Conference will give deep attention to this issue, get a concrete plan, so to benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, is of much importance.</p>
<p>According to the practices of various countries, our country should immediately organize a quarantine bureau to assign a specialized department to manage animal inspection matters. When ships enter the port, if they are carrying animals, the captain should immediately report to the animal quarantine officer at the port about the animals' journey during the voyage. Then, the officer will send a veterinarian to inspect them. Animals that pass the inspection will first be quarantined. After the quarantine period, they will be allowed to be transported to various places.</p>
<p>The quarantine station should be specially constructed, with a director responsible for it. The length of the quarantine period depends on the distribution and prevalence of animal diseases in the exporting country at the time, as well as the health of the animal in the six months before export (except for places like Australia, where specific dates are stipulated in the regulations).</p>
<p>The animals in the quarantine station must also be thoroughly examined by a veterinarian. The examination items and methods vary depending on the animal. For example, for horses and mules, attention should be paid to Dourine (MalodieduCoit). For cattle, attention should be paid to tuberculosis. For sheep, the condition of the wool should be examined. After quarantine, the quarantine bureau will issue a certificate. Only animals with a certificate can enter the interior.</p>
<p>Quarantine fees vary from country to country. At the beginning, the government may bear more of the financial responsibility. For the sake of saving expenses, this agency can be temporarily managed by the livestock inspection group of the local commodity inspection bureaus, because China is currently lacking in veterinary talent.</p>
<p>As for animal quarantine laws and regulations, they can be drafted individually by veterinary experts at each commodity inspection bureau with reference to the conditions in various countries and our country's situation. Then, the Ministry of Industry will adopt the best and eliminate the worst, and compile them into a comprehensive document for promulgation.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Plummet by Half</h3>
<h3>-Subsidiary Coin Silver Dollars Rise and Fall-</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Sunday, banks were closed as usual, and collections were completely suspended. Foreign exchange rates in the market also plummeted by half due to scarce trading. The morning and afternoon rates were both 5%, shrinking by 4% compared to the previous day, indicating a shift in public sentiment that was beyond initial expectations. Exchange ticket trading volume was over 4.2 million in the morning session, with over 200,000 in new trades. The afternoon session saw over 400,000 in trading volume, and the small general association saw over 500,000 in trading volume. Money shops' foreign public orders totaled over 34 million in collection, with over 200,000 in remittances from various routes. Foreign collateral trading saw over 300,000 in redemptions, with no new trades. In the subsidiary coin market, Jiangsu silver dollars were 841.3 yuan in the morning session, the same in the afternoon session, falling 7 jiao compared to the previous day. The trading volume in the morning session was 8,000 jiao, and 7,500 jiao in the afternoon session. Guangdong silver dollars were 742.8 yuan in the morning session, increasing 1 yuan from the previous afternoon's rate. The afternoon session saw another increase of 9 jiao to 744.7 yuan, resulting in an increase of 1.9 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume in the morning session was 75,000 jiao, and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins remained at 330,000 wen, the same as the previous day, with a trading volume of 34,650 strings of cash, totaling 10,500 yuan.</p>

<h3>Interest Rate for Last Month Decided</h3>
<p>The highest foreign exchange rate for the past month (April) did not exceed 1 jiao per day, and the lowest rate did not reach borrowing for free. Most rates were between 4-5 fen or 2-3 fen. Therefore, the total monthly rate was only about 1.2 yuan, not reaching the fixed price of 2 yuan. This was previously reported. The Money Industry Association resolved at its regular meeting on the 2nd to keep the interest rate the same, set at 2.95 kou, with overdue interest increasing according to the 4.5 yuan base rate. Thus, the highest price is only 10 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<h3>Small Gains and Losses in Last Week's Government Bonds</h3>
<h3>-Fluctuations Only 3-5 Jiao-</h3>
<p>From April 30 to May 5 of last week, the market conditions at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange gradually declined in a natural state. International air was gradually eased from seriousness to moderation. Japan's attitude, while seemingly softened on the surface, has not fundamentally changed its policies, but has merely shifted its tone, making it a sugar-coated poison. Market sentiment initially had a bullish trend due to the stabilizing situation, but as the diplomatic situation became more complicated, the market became depressed. Major short sellers did not cover, hedging transactions decreased, silver exchange rates increased, and silver tightened. The future may still hold drastic changes. The selling on the 5th was the stock received the previous month. Therefore, this month's bulls may not be dominant. Considering the weak recovery after continuous declines, it is important to guard against major changes. On Monday, due to Japan's softening attitude and the easing of the international situation, the northern merchants bought the most, while the fifth house consistently sold. The market price rebounded by half a yuan, indicating an imbalance. On Tuesday, the news was chaotic. Major houses sold relentlessly, such as the fifth, sixth, and forty-third houses, while the fourth, eleventh, and fifty-fourth houses showed strong buying interest. As a result, there were more gains than losses. On Wednesday, the situation was best, as the intense international preparations had ceased. Buying interest was strong across the board, and market prices rose throughout the day. Although the increase was only 6-7 jiao, the trend was very strong. On Thursday, the environment remained unchanged. The fifth and forty-third houses sold heavily, and more bulls emerged. The market suddenly turned sharply downwards, with gold short sales falling by more than 1 yuan. From this, it can be seen that the major houses sought to sell large amounts. On Friday morning, the decline continued, recovering slightly in the afternoon, but still weak. The fifth and forty-third houses continued to sell. On Saturday, the decline slowed, and public sentiment softened further. Market rumors followed, and the market price fell by another 3-4 jiao. In the end, gains and losses were mixed, amounting to only 3-5 jiao. The total trading volume for spot and futures was 83.441 million yuan. The results of the highs, lows, gains, and losses are listed in the table below. (Unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Alas, it is fate! Alas, it is fate!" Attributing the loss of territory to fate, it is no wonder that when he heard the news of students petitioning, he shook his head and sighed, saying, "These are also foolish people!"</p>
<p>How unshakeable a thing is fate in the hearts of the Chinese people. Changsheng, because he acknowledged fate, allowed others to kick his backside without uttering a sound of pain. (See "Dasheng" in Literary Monthly, Volume 1, Number 4). Although Ah Q once engaged in revolution, he ultimately had to acknowledge fate and was dragged to the execution ground. There are so many fortune-tellers, physiognomists, and annual prognosticators in the City God Temple, and their business is so good every day. Therefore, fatalism in China, relying on the efforts of these preachers, will always flourish!</p>
<p>The Age of Women 	Feishi</p>
<p>I don't particularly like asking girls about their age. This is my worldly wisdom. Because I don't want to be deceived with my eyes wide open. Deception is sometimes sweet, but it must be swallowed with eyes closed and vaguely felt. Naturally, being able to feel it is a kind of happiness. But I am precisely a person who suffers from not having this kind of happiness. So I can't help but understand that bit of worldly wisdom. In fact, all worldly wisdom mostly grows out of deception. This shows that I have also been deceived, but in the end, I opened my eyes and didn't feel that kind of happiness.</p>
<p>In our village, we have always respected age. "The court is not as good as rank, and the village is not as good as age," this is what the old scholars who have been left behind often recite. Even those old mud-legged men who are suppressed by the wealthy and can't even breathe often mutter in secret, "The mountain is so high that it doesn't catch the sun, and wealth can't suppress the village." And in fact, when it comes to eating at the Qingming Festival, you do have to order by age, and let those old men with high years sit in the upper seats, although usually, you often let those wealthy children walk in front. Therefore, people generally like congratulatory words like "Three Abundances and Auspicious Celebrations." Not to mention anything else, even when I was a child, I liked myself growing up, growing up like my father. Sometimes I would even climb onto stools and tables to compare heights with my father, thinking that as long as I was as tall as my father, I could enjoy my father's privileges, at least I wouldn't get beaten by him again. I still remember, every time during the New Year, on the evening of New Year's Eve, when my grandmother touched the top of my head and said, "Cheng Sun Tou, you've grown another year!" How much I liked it!</p>
<p>When I grew up and went to school, I liked age even more. In elementary school, I always stood at the end during gymnastics, and I hated others calling me the tail. And whenever I fought with others, I always suffered from being short, and others' hands always hit my head and face. When I got to middle school, although my height was about the same as others, whenever there was an occasion to form sworn brotherhood, nine times out of ten I was relied upon to be the youngest and run errands. I suffered too much from my age! My only way at that time was to hope to grow up quickly, but I didn't know that adding a ten to my age meant I couldn't even use the addition I learned when I first started learning arithmetic. How stupid!</p>
<p>Later, I went to a co-educational school, and then I started interacting with girls. At the same time, because of all kinds of things, I also became familiar with those women who were active in society. At that time, I envied them, envied them for growing up too fast, and simply by virtue of their tall stature and sophisticated attitude, they could cover up the small age they said and make others regard them as older sisters, suddenly a feeling of admiration arose. Perhaps it was because they were born into wealthy families, had better nutrition, and had excellent development? I thought that way. But one thing made me strange and also made me feel sorry for them: why not say their age was a little older, so that name and reality would match?</p>
<p>Once, it was a few years ago, when I had just arrived in Peiping for the first time, Yi came to see me with Sister Jing and asked me to have dinner together. At the table, I just silently looked, looked out the window, looked at the blue sky outside the window dotted with stars. Ordinary social talk was not appropriate, even if we wanted to talk about the weather, there was only a black night that couldn't distinguish between sunny and cloudy. There was no way to talk about what I wanted to talk about, the Yi I saw and imagined was too different. The greatness of silence! But they chattered endlessly, asking me this and that, talking about this and that, finally talking about the past from their lives, suddenly making me feel from Yi's words that I was being deceived with my eyes wide open. Not only was she far from who she was in the past, but even her age had regressed a few years. Afterwards, I asked Sister Jing, and Sister Jing said to me, "This is our women's habit, if you don't say you're two years younger, others will add two years more, who told you to believe it's true?" From then on, I knew that women's habits were the opposite of mine, they thought the younger the age, the better. And I knew that to ask their age was to seek deception.</p>
<p>In the past few years, I have always used this lesson to treat girls, and as a result, I have grown into and established this worldly wisdom. But many girls are still using this kind of deception that can't deceive people to deceive people. To avoid this kind of deception, only those girls who don't sell their youth and beauty, the hope of women in the future should probably be placed on such girls.</p>
<p>Watching the Women's Christian Association's Female Workers' Play (Part 2) 	Ling He</p>
<p>The second play was "Sister Xiang," which was about three street performers who, because their daughter couldn't do somersaults, the father picked up a whip and beat his daughter. At this time, a worker walked up from the stage to stand up for the daughter, beat the inhuman father up. Afterwards, the daughter asked the man to stop, explaining in her words that they had fled from the countryside because of war and had to do this because of poverty. In the end, the father also admitted his mistake, ending as a tragedy. This play adopted a new form, with the stage and the audience becoming one, not only with the audience throwing coins onto the stage, but also with the actors mingling among the audience, talking to the characters in the play, and the audience walking onto the stage, all of which should be brought up here. This form, if performed well, can naturally achieve a better effect, especially making the entire audience become characters in the play, if the script is so decided.</p>
<p>The third play, "Street Night Scene," depicts a group of refugees fleeing the war, who are hungry, sick, tired, and homeless, and have to spend the night on the street. But the patrolmen come to interfere with them, saying that they are not allowed to stay by other people's windows. And from the window comes the sound of a piano and the licentious laughter of women, echoing the groans of the sick outside the window. Later, there are dumpling sellers, prostitutes, and wandering youths. We see the patrolmen molesting prostitutes, the wanderers beating the patrolmen, the refugees stealing other people's dumplings to eat, and the refugees' bags being stolen by others. In the end, it turns out that the prostitute and the wanderer are the children of the sick refugee, and the play closes in a burst of crying.</p>
<p>Regarding this play, I don't want to say much about the script, what I want to say is that because there are fixed lines, the atmosphere of the play is quite serious. And when we look at the emotions of the audience at the time, they are all attentive and nervous, even standing up from their seats, unwilling to ignore every line of dialogue in the play. Therefore, we can prove that although the appreciation level of the workers is lower, if the play depicts their own lives or is close to their lives, they will definitely not be unable to understand it. On the contrary, they have been deeply moved by the characters in the play.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't say that this play was performed very well, at least in terms of directing and performing techniques, if there were experts to guide it, it would inevitably have a better effect. However, generally speaking, at least the elements of civilization drama are less than in the previous two plays. Therefore, we can get factual proof here. We have always had a wrong understanding in the past, thinking that only civilization drama can satisfy the workers, but now, on the contrary, they need a serious atmosphere and deep stimulation, then why don't we let them go on a more technical path? This is the most important task for everyone engaged in drama movement.</p>
<p>Finally, I deeply express my sincere respect to the ladies of the Women's Christian Association who hosted this performance, they have recognized the times and have undertaken the difficult task that ordinary people engaged in drama movement are unwilling to undertake. Therefore, we only hope that they can pay more attention to the technical aspects as much as possible, in order to reach a perfect state. Needless to say, this kind of enthusiastic and hard-working experiment has its own great significance in the Chinese drama movement. I sincerely wish them success!</p>
<p>Night of Wind and Rain 	Chun</p>
<p>It was past midnight, and I was returning from the bureau after a night shift. The north wind was raging and the rain was torrential, with no hint of spring. I hired a rickshaw. I felt too tired and could have used the rare opportunity to rest in the rickshaw, but the desolate road and the houses on both sides, most of which had turned off their lights and closed their doors, only allowed me to see two rows of tall black shadows on both sides. A gust of wind, a burst of rain, in this desolate and dreary night, a rickshaw slowly dragged along, as if walking in a cold, icy tunnel, how tragic and depressing it was! Instead, I perked up, as if anticipating some unexpected attack. A wave of fear arose in my heart, and then I began to worry, and anything and everything was heavily tinged with fear. The more fearful I became, the more I worried, and the more I worried, the more fearful I became. The hunched back of the rickshaw puller was a symbol of being drained of blood and marrow. To me, it seemed like a devil's longing. His uneven breathing, to him, was the panting of exhaustion, but to me, it sounded like the groaning of a dying patient. Walking under this oppressive fear, I felt like I had been walking for hours, but in reality, I had only walked for about twenty minutes, barely half the distance.</p>
<p>"Woo woo," a low cry, like weeping or shouting, invaded my eardrums. The strings of fear suddenly twanged again, and I couldn't help but shiver, but a contradictory curiosity forced me to see what was going on. A tall Western-style house, a flat, round electric lamp at the entrance, the red light reflecting the words "An Le Ju" (Comfortable Residence), illuminating a pile of dark figures crouching on the cement steps. It was probably a woman. From the faint light, I could make out her disheveled hair. A weak cry came from there.</p>
<p>"What is this?" I was half surprised by this phenomenon, and half wanted to use my talking to break through this monotonous wail, or perhaps reduce the fear in my heart, so I deliberately asked the rickshaw puller.</p>
<p>"Nothing, just giving birth by the roadside," the rickshaw puller replied, seemingly accustomed to it.</p>
<p>"Hmm, giving birth to a child, giving birth to a child in the open air," I muttered to myself, repeating it once. The rickshaw had traveled a long way, but the wailing still seemed to be ringing in my ears, and it became clearer and more mournful, like a wisp of silk thread, hanging in my heart.</p>
<p>"A warm room, a south-facing window, a single iron bed, two cabinets, a long table, two or three small stools, all painted snow-white, just like the walls, doors, and windows of the room. One of the cabinet doors is made of glass, with many scissors and tubes arranged in layers inside. A delivery operating table, made entirely of white enamel, with a large air cushion on top. Two angel-like female nurses, each holding things for the pregnant woman to eat, such as milk. A kind-faced old doctor, frequently stroking the pregnant woman's abdomen, as if a loving mother were lulling a child to sleep. The flickering firelight illuminated everyone's faces, presenting an apple-red hue."</p>
<p>"A lonely, desolate, windy, and rainy cold night, rolling and crying on the cement floor, forcing the birth of a small life, the pain that can make one faint, the wailing sound from groaning to shouting, the unborn small life is her only companion, besides herself. Several tight spasms, and with a slap, a small life is produced under this wind and rain. After several times of fainting and waking up, quickly tidying everything up. But the indelible bloodstains are eventually scolded for staining the cement floor."</p>
<p>At this moment, I thought of the delivery room in the hospital, and then I imagined the scene of giving birth in the open air just now. It replaced the fear that occupied my mind, like two different movies playing in front of my eyes. At this time, the sound of the wind and raindrops became tighter and tighter, agitating the tarpaulin on my rickshaw.</p>

<p>If I Had Known Earlier 	Xiao Cen</p>
<p>There was an old woman whose daughters-in-law had all died, leaving behind only one child, so she treated him like a family treasure, taking great care of him. Because she wanted him to continue the family line and to provide for the ancestral rituals, he became the supreme emperor of the family, going to the provincial capital to study and getting whatever he wanted, never being contradicted. Finally, he graduated from a provincial middle school and returned, and the grandmother and grandson were extremely happy. All the third aunts and second sisters-in-law in the neighborhood gathered to congratulate her. Many illiterate aunts and sisters-in-law even took the opportunity to ask her grandson to write their daughters' and sisters' horoscopes, but he picked up the pen and trembled at the red paper. Some also asked him to look at the red almanac to choose a lucky day for washing their hair or traveling, and he turned the almanac from beginning to end several times but still couldn't figure it out, blaming the book's unclear printing. One day was the anniversary of the ancestors' death, and the old woman told him to go forward and kowtow, but he only walked up and bowed three times, not too deep and not too shallow. The grandmother was so angry that she couldn't bear it, and stretched out her wrinkled hand, unceremoniously giving him a crisp slap that he had never received before, and resentfully muttered, "If I had known earlier, who would have let you go to that devilish school! Wasting my grandmother's money!"</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>A college student who had been unemployed for many years suddenly came up with a brilliant plan one day. He thought his method was clever and jumped for joy alone in his room, showing his confidence and hope of success. Then, without hesitation, he sent his only relatively fashionable suit to the pawnshop, and as a result, he got five silver dollars back. He sized it up for a long time, and then turned the five dollars into two boxes of foreign biscuits, carefully and cautiously sending them to a bureau chief next door, asking him to help introduce him to various agencies to work as a small clerk. But the bureau chief sent a maid to answer: all the agencies are currently laying off staff, and I can't introduce you for the time being, but waiting for a while should be okay! Of course, unemployed people, hungry people, can only sit and wait for wealthy and powerful people to bestow favors one day! The next day, he heard that the bureau chief's nephew had returned from Southeast Asia after losing his job, and the third day he heard that he had become a second-class clerk. The college student thought to himself: what I hope for is just to be a third-class clerk, why did the bureau chief accept my biscuits and still tell me to wait, haven't I been waiting for several years? Deception? Now even my suit is gone, if I had known earlier, why would I have begged for mercy!</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>A young couple quarreled endlessly every day. The wife accused the husband of having a bad temper, but the husband said that the wife was not modern enough. Sometimes they seemed to have to get divorced! But the divorce papers had to be taken to a lawyer, but on the first night after crossing the threshold of the lawyer's office, the husband felt very lonely, as if he had lost something. He paced back and forth all night, and even when he went to bed, he felt even more uneasy. The quilt was strangely empty, always feeling cold, especially his feet were icy cold, and then he thought to himself: it won't do without a wife. Not long after, he found another wife who was more to his liking, but she was a bit too modern, going dancing with many boyfriends every day, and spending a lot of money on clothes every month. The husband advised her to save a little, and not to dance until dawn. The wife said: you can't control me. Turning around, she slapped the husband in the face. At this time, he said regretfully, "If I had known earlier..."</p>
<p>Mistaken Face 	Hui</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the Creator's occasional negligence, a beautiful face was arranged on a nanny.</p>
<p>Although she was a woman nearing thirty, fate doubled down on mocking her, giving her a graceful appearance. If they were not regular customers, they would definitely mistake her for the mistress of the house or a distinguished guest of the owner's family.</p>
<p>The night seemed to give us temporary peace:</p>
<p>"Why are you treating the nanny differently than before?" the mistress said.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" the master replied.</p>
<p>"I'm saying you're being too polite to the current nanny. Too polite."</p>
<p>""</p>
<p>"Do you want me to treat servants with a fierce face? Do you have class consciousness? Is feudal ideology still firmly occupying your mind?"</p>
<p>""</p>
<p>"Damn it, you're using official language with me too! Do you think people haven't seen you and the nanny laughing and talking in the kitchen? You're not qualified to hire a nanny! If you fancy her looks, then marry her as your wife and divorce me immediately!..." The mistress started to get angry.</p>
<p>Sleeping in the attic, she couldn't help but feel a chill in her heart when she heard the above conversation.</p>
<p>For a master who controls the purse strings to flirt with a nanny, the nanny cannot refuse to deal with it perfunctorily. This seems to be an old trick that is often played on her. Before, when the mistress of a family returned to her parents' home, the master actually started to be attentive to her, sending her cosmetics to win her chastity, so she had to leave. Before that, a man without a mistress in the house made the same jokes. Now, this kind of story has come again.</p>
<p>The wind blew in from nowhere, swirling under her torn quilt. It was very quiet all around, and occasionally there was the sound of a car horn, with the wheels speeding from one end to the other.</p>
<p>The next day, the mistress calculated her wages, and she packed up her bags and left.</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>Roads spread out one by one in front of her, and the dusk gradually lengthened. She wandered aimlessly, and young loafers and businessmen all stared at her fiercely. There were also several who pretended to accidentally bump into her or brush past her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Is it okay to go to a brothel?" Even more rogue-like people laughed with playful faces.</p>
<p>The Creator, you are mocking people like this. Why didn't you put this face on the young mistress or dancer class, for the young masters and playboys to enjoy and be fortunate enough to have?</p>
<p>The Old Man Died Drunk 	Ya Fei</p>
<p>I often hear people say, "Everyone else is drunk, only I am sober." But now someone actually hates that everyone in the world is drunk alive, and he voluntarily died drunk. This is truly a rare piece of news in a thousand years. According to a certain evening newspaper on the 11th, a dispatch from Madrid: "In the Andalusia region of Spain, a certain farmer, aged eighty-six, suddenly developed pessimistic ideas, declaring: 'Everyone in the world is drunk alive, I will die drunk.' At night, he used a large bucket to hold one hundred and twenty gallons of wine, placed it in the courtyard, and he climbed to the roof and jumped into the bucket, and as a result, he died drunk..." Dying drunk is, after all, so extraordinary! A great consciousness. I imagine that this farmer can truly be said to have broken through everything. He did not die of water, but died of wine. It was not drinking wine, but bathing in wine, dying drunk in a large amount of wine, which is truly a world-shattering feat, a unique way of dying. When those people who are drunk alive and dream to death see it, what kind of feelings will they have! But! He hated the world's drunkenness, but he himself lived in a daze until he was eighty-six years old. Was he not also drunk alive? It was not until he reached this great age that he realized the meaninglessness of life, that being drunk alive was not as good as being drunk to death, so he resolutely died. This death cannot but make people suspicious, right? However, in this long process, he may have been able to understand it, or it can be said that he had more experience, and naturally the stimulation was very deep, before he made this decision to be disgusted with the world!</p>
<p>I still remember in the past few years, a news report from Sweden: a certain rich man, Lai, accumulated tens of thousands of dollars, but suddenly felt that this kind of money was dirty and mean, so he did not hesitate to imitate the story of "tearing up the coupons and flying the coins," throwing thousands of dollars into the streets. There is no doubt that he was stimulated by money. Therefore, he no longer wanted to keep this lousy money that made him turn day and night upside down. Now his actions are indeed a quick act of revenge, truly letting out a sigh of relief for many poor people in the world. Because although money is valuable and can control everything people have, there are also times when it will be abandoned by people. However, those unpromising poor wretches insisted on fighting to snatch it, resulting in being treated to batons by the police, so what can be said!</p>
<p>Now, a certain farmer in Sweden lived to this great age and suddenly committed suicide, and it was a drunken suicide. Of course, he was also subjected to a major stimulus in life. But he did not see that there are many people in the world who are drunk alive, but they are greedy for life and afraid of death, living in a daze. All day long, they seem to be drunk in wine, bustling and fighting for land, dreaming there. If someone were to ask them themselves, they would not be able to answer what it was for!</p>
<p>Human beings are originally a kind of stimulating animal, and naturally everything is prone to impulsive inspiration. Wine is also something that emboldens and helps excitement. The ancients also had stories of using wine to relieve sorrow. Today, of course, it is possible to have the fact of using wine to wash one's body, washing away all the sins and mistakes on one's body.</p>
<p>Cuckoo Bird 	Qiu Yue</p>
<p>A Southern Legend</p>
<p>Just when the red bayberry flowers were blooming all over the mountains and fields, there was a kind of plaintive and moving cry of mountain birds flying and singing everywhere. The sound sounded like the two words "cuckoo," and these two words in the mouth of the mountain bird symbolized the origin of a tragic and mournful story.</p>
<p>The summer night of May is full of dreamlike quiet and poetic scenery, and the bright moonlight is sprinkled on the ground like water. The evergreen trees in the courtyard quietly brush the swaying shadows of the trees, swaying in front of a small window. Inside the window are a pair of young women, leaning against each other embroidering a flower bud, and the appearance of the flower bud is about to take shape.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law, I don't like this dull pattern! I heard that red bayberry flowers are very beautiful when embroidered, so teach me this one!" The smaller girl said,嬌憨地.</p>
<p>"I have never learned this pattern before. Oh, now is the season when red bayberry flowers are in full bloom, so let's wait until we see the pattern of the flowers before we embroider them, okay? Auntie."</p>
<p>"I can't wait until tomorrow! Oh, sister-in-law! Look, how bright the moon is tonight, why don't we take this opportunity to go to the mountain behind the house to take a look?"</p>

<p>The artistic passion moved this pair of young women. In the moonlight, they took each other's hands and followed the shadows to find the source of art.</p>
<p>The mountain scenery at night is so quiet and desolate, and the clear light of the moon shines on the mountain trees, like a vast green洲.</p>
<p>Crimson red bayberry flowers, like the blushing cheeks of a girl, appeared in front of them. They were in high spirits, arm in arm, staggering towards the tree. The young girl casually broke off a branch of red bayberry flowers, watching without blinking. Her sister-in-law climbed to a higher level of the hillside and came back with a blooming flower.</p>
<p>At this time, the moon was covered by dark clouds, turning into a bleak mountain color.</p>
<p>Just as the returning woman was about to approach her husband's sister, it caused her spirit to cramp. There were blood stains on the ground under the tree, and her husband's sister did not know where she had gone.</p>
<p>The stinging feeling made her unable to live any longer, and she fell from the jagged rocks into the deep valley...</p>
<p>Since then, every time the red bayberry flowers bloom, the cry of this bird is heard, sadly, it is the two words "cuckoo".</p>
<p>Novel Tomorrow (10) (1) 	Mu Lin</p>
<p>I gave him a questioning look.</p>
<p>"I wonder if we will have such a chance in the future?"</p>
<p>"Why not?" I pitied him, he was always so cowardly. I squeezed his hand tightly, as if encouraging him, and said.</p>
<p>"You trust me? Yingmei."</p>
<p>"I trust you, I will always trust you!"</p>
<p>We walked forward slowly in silence. What was the point anyway, we finally arrived at the door of that clothing store, and when two wedding dresses pierced our eyes under the strong light, he lowered his head and pushed open the door of the clothing store.</p>
<p>The one who greeted us was a foreign girl, who examined the order I gave her, smiled and took out a prisoner's uniform from the glass cabinet. I was going to wear it and send it to hell. But I want to thank that foreign girl, she kindly asked me to go to the inner room to try on the clothes, and turned back to congratulate him in not pure Chinese, should that poor man laugh or cry?</p>
<p>In an inner room with long mirrors installed on all four walls, I tried on the outfit in front of the mirror, like a scene I saw in a movie. The figure in the mirror was a criminal wearing a red prisoner's uniform, but what crime had I committed? I angrily took it off, and the foreign girl thought the style was not suitable, and said apologetically:</p>
<p>"Miss, this is the latest style. If it doesn't suit Miss's taste, we can alter it and send it to your residence."</p>
<p>I said, "Very good. Pack it up for me."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Miss."</p>
<p>I came back outside, and he stood there blankly, thinking of the foreign girl's congratulations, the poor man.</p>
<p>She sent us to the door and said diligently, "I'm very sorry that I can't come to congratulate you. Is it tomorrow? Sir, Miss."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow! Thank you!" he answered loudly. Oh God! Tomorrow, tomorrow, you killed two people! (The End)</p>

<p>Movie Supplement 	Republic of China, Year 23, May 7, Monday 	Educational Films in China (3) 	Lu Shibai</p>
<p>(4) Urgent Crisis and Salvation</p>
<p>In the four years since China discovered the call to promote educational films, although there have been many grandiose plans and some enthusiastic organizations, the only things that have become a reality are the 30 or 40 volumes of news films published by the Central Propaganda Department and the Military Commission, as well as the implementation work of the Chinese Educational Film Association and the National Educational Film Promotion Office.</p>
<p>The author never believes that there are no people in China who deeply understand the power of film, nor does he believe that there are no people in the country who are willing to contribute to educational films with an indomitable spirit. However, the biggest reason why there are only calls for promotion and fanciful planners is actually the economic constraint of supreme authority. Recently, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association is in Shanghai. The reason for the implementation work in Shanghai is that there is no way to deal with the economy, resulting in increasing losses, and there is a worry of stagnation. The implementation of educational films in Shanghai is the pioneer in the country. The reason why the provinces have promoted the initiative is that the implementation in Shanghai is effective, so they followed suit. If Shanghai stops its work, then the impact will be that the future of educational films in China will be unwilling to be said or unbearable to say!</p>
<p>The Chinese Educational Film Association is neither commercial in nature, with no funds to collect, nor a government agency, with no public funds to pay. The funds assisted by the government, at the General Assembly level, only the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Film Censorship Committee have a monthly subsidy of 100 yuan. Recently, the Film Censorship Committee has been reorganized, and whether this subsidy will continue to be issued is a question! As for the Shanghai Branch, it has requested subsidies from the municipal government twice, but both times it has been rejected on the grounds of municipal treasury deficits, and there has been no result. Only the municipal party department has a monthly subsidy of 100 yuan. And since the branch bears the mission of actual work, with more than ten employees, the monthly expenditure must be at least more than 1,300 yuan. The meager subsidy is naturally far from enough. Although the branch's income also includes school transportation fees and advertising fees of about 800 or 900 yuan, the monthly deficit is always 400 or 500 yuan. And when it first opened, it borrowed a large amount of money from people to purchase equipment. Now, debt repayment is difficult, and future fundraising is impossible to imagine. The author has drawn up several possible solutions.</p>
<p>(1) Fundraising: Without a fund, there is no guarantee at all. With a fund, there is a guarantee, workers can feel at ease, and the development of the cause will also be rapid. Therefore, fundraising is a fundamental task.</p>
<p>(2) Encourage donations: Encouraging public donations is also an easy task. The government is now vigorously encouraging enthusiastic people who donate to support education. If we recognize that film is education and give encouragement to enthusiastic donors who promote educational films, I firmly believe that it is not difficult for people to be willing to promote it.</p>
<p>The above two methods, the former is active, and the latter is passive. If we can advance on both sides, it will not be difficult for educational films to be popularized throughout the country in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(4) The scope of promotion should be expanded with effort</p>
<p>To seek the popularization of educational films, promotion is the first step. Even if we do not have the ability to make our own films now, and must rely on foreigners, and must increase some imports, it is only worth it. We need to have many places to promote it, and we will spend a huge amount of money to produce films, so that the effect will not be limited to only a part. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review of "Love Finds Andy Hardy" 	Ya Fu</p>
<p>She Made Her Bed - Cathay</p>
<p>Among many so-called "soft films," this should be a relatively interesting work, right? I think.</p>
<p>Of course, the so-called soft theory of film has no reason to exist at all. Except for intentionally distorting the true value of film art for a certain task, there is no better intention. However, classifying films with no serious content as "soft" is exactly what they want. Therefore, "Love Finds Andy Hardy" may be a work within the scope of soft films.</p>
<p>A very ordinary love story is the entire content of this film. However, the screenwriter or director spent a lot of effort to visualize the multi-faceted love entanglement and tell the story very vividly. Therefore, when people are idle and need to be entertained, like listening to "Pearl Pagoda" in the bookstore, this film is very good for relieving sorrow and boredom.</p>
<p>Indeed, the author (including all the technical staff) described this film vividly. Using the audience's established psychology, on the one hand, he wrote about the good conscience of a pair of men and women, and on the other hand, he simultaneously wrote about a pair of immoral men and women in contrast. As a result, the good conscience won the sympathy of the audience, so that they kept getting better to the end, using all methods, so that they could have a happy ending for their lovers, satisfying the audience's desires, and at the same time, making the adulterers and adulteresses keep getting worse to the end, until they died a bad death. This technique is common in American films, and the one-size-fits-all operation is still somewhat moving to some people.</p>
<p>But this kind of thing is perhaps what we can often see. For example, Sally Eilers's role as a young woman, she is virtuous, she can abide by the way of women, but she has been married to her husband for four years, but she has not been able to get true love, "enduring everything, although there is a loyal man who expresses his love to her." And her husband, Robert Young's Duke, is also what we can often see. He loves his wife very much, but at the same time, he is hooked up with unscrupulous women. The screenwriter's description of his personality from his self-proclaimed animal trainer being scratched on the arm by a cat and dying under a tiger fight is indeed very cute. Lew Ayres's character is an extremely ordinary person, but has no characteristics, and Leila Hyams's role as a vagrant woman is not written as too lewd, so that there is also a so-called love component between her and Duke, which is again what we often see. Therefore, from the perspective of the entire story development, and through the director's flexible skills and the actors' appropriate performances, they all give people a sense of ordinary truth.</p>
<p>However, in the end, the author, in order to please the public, in order to win people's sympathy, that scene of a pistol, a tiger fighting with a person, plus the climax formed by the fire, exaggerated the ordinariness of the story, although the technique is very clever.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this film has its own considerable achievements, but the lack of deep content is the screenwriter's conscious decision.</p>
<p>Review of "Bureau of Missing Persons" 	Yi Jun</p>
<p>Bureau of Missing Persons | Nanjing Screening |</p>
<p>Precisely because this social system has its own defects, whether in China, the United States, England, or France, as long as this social system exists in that country, then kidnapping, escape, suicide, and other things will occur due to the defects of this social system.</p>
<p>Looking at our own country, just taking Shanghai as an example, cases of kidnapping, escape, love suicide, murder due to adultery, etc. occur almost every day, and in the brilliant golden United States, as many as 27,000 people disappeared last year, and the reason is easy to understand.</p>
<p>"Bureau of Missing Persons," which is promoted as a rare description of social evils in recent years, does not tell us the social reasons.</p>
<p>This is really a romance between a detective and a young girl, and it is also wearing the coat of a "detective film."</p>
<p>Like ordinary detective films, a red herring is deliberately laid out here. That girl is accused of being a murderer, but the truth will naturally come out. That girl is not the murderer, but another person is the murderer. Here, daring to have the coincidences like ordinary detective films, Norma Shearer will come to the funeral home again, and Norma will also happen to meet the murderer. This is very coincidental.</p>
<p>Although "Bureau of Missing Persons" is not much different from ordinary detective films,</p>
<h3>Lafayette Centennial Commemoration: Joint American-French Broadcast Celebration</h3>
<p>(Paris) General Lafayette of France participated in the American Revolutionary War and achieved remarkable feats. This year, May, marks the centennial of his death. Americans are holding a Lafayette centennial exhibition in New York to commemorate him. French Foreign Minister Barthou and U.S. Secretary of State Hull will simultaneously broadcast speeches via wireless radio from Paris and Washington, D.C., to express the friendship between the United States and France. Barthou's speech first expressed gratitude for the United States' grand commemoration of General Lafayette. He continued, stating that the French and American nations have for generations adhered to common ideals and principles, cherishing them dearly. This is evidenced by the sacrifice of many Americans during the Great War. Even today, the great efforts of Americans are aimed at seeking human freedom. France also deeply hopes to restore the virtues of its forefathers, viewing this as a guiding principle for its endeavors. France should now be cautious and disciplined, avoiding all disturbances during periods of transition or prosperity. Furthermore, France will never forget the assistance given by the United States during the Great War, which helped it avert danger and secure peace. In conclusion, the mission of French and American politicians is to exhaust their wisdom to remove obstacles and barriers between nations. This is what we hope for, and what you (referring to the United States) also hope for. May the great name of Lafayette once again serve as a medium for connecting the French and American nations. This is our earnest hope. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Secretary of State Hull's speech briefly stated that although General Lafayette has passed away for a century, the United States' respect and admiration for him remain unchanged. General Lafayette dedicated himself to freedom and came to our aid when the United States was in danger. We are grateful and will never forget his chivalrous spirit. Lafayette was not only the greatest citizen of both the Old and New Worlds but also a citizen of the world, as he best represented the spirit of humanity. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Arab War: Determination of British and Italian Seizure of Red Sea Control; Determination of Hejaz Armaments Originating from British Aid; Determination of Italian Latent Influence in Yemen</h3>
<p>(Paris) An editorial in "The Times" commented on the changes in the Kingdom of Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. It began by stating the reasons for the war between Hejaz and Yemen, saying that after King Ibn Saud of Hejaz conquered the Asir region (between Hejaz and Yemen), the leaders of the region refused to be controlled by the "Wahhabi" sect (a fanatical religious sect within Islam in Hejaz). They rose up in rebellion, and King Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din of Yemen sheltered and aided them. Therefore, Ibn Saud was furious and personally led troops to suppress them. The Yemeni army was poorly equipped and lacked discipline, leading to defeat. The King of Yemen engaged in conspiracies in the British protectorate zone of the Arabian Peninsula and attempted to develop the port of Hodeidah (on the eastern shore of the Red Sea) to reduce the prosperity of the British port of Aden, thus arousing British suspicion. In addition, to defend the country against Hejaz, the King of Yemen imposed heavy taxes, which the people could not bear. Furthermore, due to poor governance, various mountain tribes expressed dissatisfaction and refused to aid Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din. After the King of Yemen's defeat, he requested King Fuad of Egypt to mediate, but Fuad is said to be refusing. Currently, a rebellion has broken out in the Sa'dah region of Yemen, and it is feared that Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din's regime will collapse and become unmanageable. As for King Ibn Saud of Hejaz, he is quite farsighted. His trusted advisor, the Englishman Philby, sent a letter to The Times on March 24, predicting that incidents would occur between Hejaz and Yemen, and now his prediction has come true. Although King Ibn Saud of Hejaz insists on Arab nationalism and opposes the intrusion of foreign forces, his methods are flexible and he has gained much support. The Hejaz army is well-equipped and has ample military supplies, thanks to British aid. In addition, Italy's latent influence may have a role in Yemen's foreign policy. Although this is only speculation and there is no factual evidence, it is certain that Italy has vested interests in Yemen, and some Italian officers serve as trainers in the Yemeni army. As for the claim that the inside story of the war between Hejaz and Yemen is actually a secret struggle between two powers for control of the Red Sea's entrance, this cannot be readily believed.

<h3>New British Ambassador to Japan to Assume Office Soon: Sir Francis Fladgate Known as an Expert on the Far East</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the "Tokyo Daily News," the new British ambassador to Japan, Sir Francis Fladgate, paid a visit to the British Emperor yesterday and plans to leave Britain soon to take office in Japan. Sir Francis is extremely knowledgeable about Central Asia and the Far East, which is why Britain and Japan considered him a suitable person. (Guolian, 6th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Attorney General to Interpret Johnson Act: Determination that Britain, Italy, etc., Are Not Defaulting War Debt Nations; Determination That Soviet Russia's Previous Debts, If Unpaid, Are Applicable</h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Congress previously passed a bill proposed by Senator Johnson, stipulating that the United States should cease financial assistance to countries in default of debt. This bill was signed into law by President Roosevelt on April 12. However, the interpretation of how this law should be implemented is being studied by Attorney General Cummings, who will issue a conclusion. The State Department recently announced that it fully agrees with Cummings's conclusion. Cummings's interpretation of the law states that, according to the provisions of the Johnson Act, countries such as Britain and those in similar situations, such as Czechoslovakia, Italy, Latvia, and Lithuania, cannot be considered in default of debt to the United States as of now because they have made partial payments. As for lower-level governments of defaulting countries, such as city governments, if the city government itself has not defaulted on debts to the United States, the Johnson Act does not apply. In other words, financial assistance may still be provided to that city government. Also, Canada, although part of the British Empire, is not subject to the Johnson Act. In addition, foreign exchange transactions, postal money orders, promissory notes, checks, and other common means of conducting banking business are not restricted by this law. However, the issuance of securities and bonds in the United States for the purpose of providing funds to the government of a defaulting country is subject to this law and will be prohibited. As for the Soviet government's responsibility for the debts owed by previous Russian governments, the U.S. attitude is fully consistent with the generally recognized principles of international law, namely, that the Soviet government should be regarded as being in default of debt. Although negotiations to determine the total amount of Russia's debt to the United States are ongoing, there is no legal principle on which to base the conclusion that the situation of defaulting debt has disappeared. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department recently issued a statement with supplementary clauses regarding Cummings's interpretation of the Johnson Act, stating that although countries such as Britain and those in similar situations are not considered in default of debt as of now because they have paid a portion of their war debts, these countries must pay all their outstanding war debts in the future if they do not wish to be affected by the Johnson Act. This opinion from the State Department is extremely important because the war debts due on June 15 of this year are approaching. Furthermore, the State Department believes that Cummings's interpretation of the Johnson Act is intended to limit the scope of application of the law as much as possible, restricting it only to countries that are in default of debt to the U.S. government. Countries that are in default of debt to U.S. banks or to U.S. citizens are not subject to this law. Therefore, the Johnson Act does not apply to Latin American countries. It is noteworthy that when Congress passed the Johnson Act, its original intention was to treat Latin American countries the same as countries that owed war debts. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Train Conference: Hope for Silver Bill Revival; Possibility of Passage in Congress; Three Points Still to Be Negotiated</h3>
<p>(Washington) Since President Roosevelt's meeting with the Senate Silver Bloc today, the hope for silver coinage has suddenly revived. When President Roosevelt decided to attend the funeral of former Treasury Secretary Woodin, the silver-bloc senators boarded the President's train and conferred with the President for an hour. They disembarked only when the train reached Baltimore. The silver-bloc senators declared that discussions would continue on Monday. Wheeler, the leader of the Silver Bloc, told an Associated Press interviewer that although today's discussion did not produce concrete results, there is a possibility that the Silver Bill will pass in this session of Congress. Another supporter of the Silver Bill said that we still hope to obtain the government's approval. According to the senators' statements to the press when leaving the Baltimore station, there are still three points unresolved in the Silver Bill: (1) Nationalize silver, with a value not exceeding fifty cents per ounce; (2) Establish a currency reserve of 70% gold and 30% silver; (3) Authorize the President to negotiate an international silver agreement. According to the Silver Bloc, the President agreed to study their proposals before continuing the meeting at the White House on Monday. Senator King said,</p>
<h3>Zhao Kong Monk Detained Upon Return to England: Will Come to China via Canada</h3>

<p>Attendees of the meeting told the President that this session of Congress must pass the Silver Bill. The President listened to the senators' statements with sympathy and assured them that various proposals would receive equal consideration.

Morgenthau will also accompany the President on a tour of the Potomac River at the end of this week. It is hoped here that the silver issue will be thoroughly discussed. (National, 5th)</p>
