<p>時評</p>
<h3>所望於全國合作事業討論會者</h3>
<p>廷</p>
<p>本年四月十七日。江北合作事業討論會在鎭江召集。頗極一時之盛。最近全國經濟委員會，農查復興委員會，和實業部。爲推廣與指導合作事業起見。又定於明年一月二十三日至二十七日至二十七日舉行全國合作事業討論會。這的確是件很可欣慰的消息。我們敢提出幾點意見來喚起大家的注意。</p>
<p>第一，據中央農業實騐所調查。在全國合作社中以信用合作社爲最發逹。佔總數百分之四六·二。但據本報年鑑社調查。廿二年度全國信用合作社數共五千七百二十所。而股本不過三十二萬七千八百八十元。以全國之大。信用合作社的股本短少至此。杯水車薪。何濟於事。力能充實信用合作社的。第一當推各大都市間的銀行家。本市各家大銀行（如中國·上海商業·金城等）已在轉移目光於農村投資。而投資的對象則注重於鄉間信用合作社。這點和合作事業的發展最有關係。確是可喜。不過眼前銀行界在内地的投資。僅有數百萬元。仍嫌太少。而亟待擴充。七月初國府公布儲蓄銀行法。其中第八條規定。儲蓄銀行對於農村合作社的質押放欵及産物爲質的放欵。不得少於存欸總額五分之一。我們以爲此條如能盡力推行。農村經濟自可大有補助。各銀行應卽組織一農村放欵的合作銀團。對於各省定一通盤計劃。以免除彼此競放的流弊。好在財部當局爲謀銀行業投資安全起見。已咨請江·浙·皖·川·粤·魯·豫·等各省府。轉行所屬。督飭各農村限卽組織健全的合作社。銀行對於不健全的合作社。儘可拒絶投資。在參加全國合作事業討論會的代表中。將有各省市政府主管長官和投資合作事業的銀行。希望他們能商量一個妥貼的辦法。救濟農村。</p>
<p>第二，國内現有合作社的數量。當以江，浙，魯，等三省爲最發逹。原因則以各該省省政府直接任指導提倡的責任。我們希望在全國討論會中。能擬訂一個具體方案。責成其餘各省市政府同樣的去實行提倡合作事業。不要讓少數銀行或慈善團體如華洋義賑會等單獨去辦。</p>
<p>第三，要組織全國合作社而没有基本的人才。仍然不能收效。所以薛仙舟氏早有創辦合作訓練院的提議。希望訓練出眞能澈底犧牲勤苦努力的合作人才來。年來江蘇山東浙江三省曾辦有合作訓練班。學生學成後任爲指導員。派赴各縣直接指導農民組織合作社。又勦匪總司令部亦曾在漢口特設合作指導人員訓練所。招收豫鄂皖贛四省中學以上畢業生四百人。訓練成材。派往各地指導。此項訓練工作亟待集中化和擴大化。原來有了良好的指導員。才能使一般社員對合作的價値和目的保持信仰。亦才能免除社内的派别。使合作範圍以外的一切事情不致於發生。</p>
<p>第四，本來各個合作社成立後。應聯合其他合作社爲一大團體。以期逹到國家和世界合作聯盟的目的。但在我國所謂合作社聯合會等組織。更是異常的缺乏。簡直可以說是没有。合作社成立後不知道互相聯合以求自身的保護和改進。其命運必將趨於失敗。或變成合作運動範圍以外的利潤企業。這點的補救辦法。亦應在下屆全國討論會中，加以嚴密的考慮。然後我國的合作事業可以名實相副而蒸蒸日上了。</p>
<h3>强有力之中國世界和平重要因素</h3>
<p>郭公使在倫敦發表演說</p>

<p>（倫敦）　中國恊會今夜舉行宴會、駐英中國公使郭泰祺曾在席間發言答覆會長麥克唐諾爵士之致詞、謂恊會如鼓勵英國民衆更了解中國、並更了解中國現成就之建設事業、則大可增進中英兩國間之關係、强有力之中國、實爲世界和平至大之因素、中國市塲含有世界貿易最雄厚之潛勢力、中國與外國所訂之合同、固尙有付欸未淸者，然中國償付外債之成績、實較任何各國爲佳、駐華英使賈德幹爵士不辭勞瘁、多所活動、而對於中國了解甚切、已博得中國種種好感、郭使繼言本年中國財政司法運輸航空考察團先後來英、從事考察、已鞏固中英兩國間傳統友誼之連鎖、中國之充分發展、端頼遠東政局之安靜與穩固、英美政治家今　如一九二二年在華盛頓之所爲、恊力維持九國公約所結晶之重要原則、强盛之中國必與英國有利、而亦可利及全世界也云云、（十七日路透電）</p>

<h3>美國考慮放棄海上自由政策</h3>
<p>總統擬要求國會授權</p>
<p>决定戰時應取之途徑</p>
<p>英美合作消除一大障碍</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國關於海上自由之政策、不久或將改變、路透社今日探悉、國務院將向羅總統提出一種考慮頗爲周秘之辦法、主張修改固有之政策、此與美國在戰爭中保持其中立國海上自由之權利一事有關、衆料政府將請國會以便宜行事權授與總統、以决定他國戰爭時美國所應採之途徑、聞若干方面贊成凡美國船隻敢于戰爭時駛入作戰區域者、美國不予以保護、此種主張之目的、蓋欲避免衝突也、國務院現所考慮者、當然可得羅總統之同意、聞此事與倫敦海軍談話毫無關係、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國向所堅持之海上自由原則、有放棄之可能、英國報界極感興趣、每日電聞報載稱、「海上自由、係美國素來主張之原則、歐戰時同盟各國海軍作戰、往往感覺爲難、卽此原則從中作梗之故、茲美國予以放棄、當係實行一種政策、其目的係在戰時减少商人之過分利潤、而又有以防止戰爭、雖防止戰爭之舉能否成功、不得而知、但廢止中立國在戰爭區域内所享受之通行權利、確有一種利益、卽有戰爭發生、其期限可因敵國得以嚴密封鎖、因而爲之縮短是也」新紀事報則謂、「美總統羅斯福頃所採取之决定、甚爲重要、此不啻正式承認、除集體安全制度而外、别無保障世界和平之道、吾人於此、可視爲美國接近國聯會之一種運動、此尤爲重要者、前此英美兩國所由難於合作者、海上自由原則實爲最大障礙、今美國放棄此種原則、則英美兩國不難密切合作、而東京對於此層、自必注意及之、無庸疑也、」云云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（紐約）　赫斯脫系各報今晨一致以封面地位登載赫氏署名之評論、對於國會通過斐律濱獨立案大加抨擊、赫氏認該案不啻將斐島委棄之於日本、該文稱、日本爲美國之患、已無可否認、日本進佔斐島而經營之、易如反掌、一旦時機成熟、彼卽將併呑斐島使其成爲日本帝國之一部、若然則日本之人力與海權、必隨之大增、此時則日人可以爲所欲爲矣、國會對於日人進佔斐島關島及代管島而向加州發展之詭謀、其能熟視無睹乎、日本固逆料英國除空文抗議外、别無作爲也、該文斥責畏縮之國會議員稱、彼等僅知爲其選區謀福利、在彼等目光中、固視選區中一人所有之數畝耕種地、較斐島一切富源商業及軍事價値爲要也、赫氏復稱、一九三五年無論乘美國飛機或日本飛機自斐島至加州、需時僅二十四時耳、且放棄斐島之時、卽美國没落之日、惟腐敗之國家始畏縮、亦惟努力之國家始膨脹、日本現正膨脹也、興念及此不寒而慄云云、（十六日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本宣告廢約前夕海軍談判决定延會</h3>
<p>三國將再開最後會議一次</p>
<p>絶續與否視日本態度而定</p>
<p>美代表準備月杪襆被歸國</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英美日三國海軍談話、大約將於星期四日延會、衆料日本廢止華盛頓海軍公約、將於星期五或星期六日公布、美代表已定本月二十九日起程返國、續開討論日期今未提及、此須視英日代表談判英國所提方案之結果爲定、英方案之主要點爲三方各宣布其造艦程序、如英日代表間之談判可望成功、則或將與美代表續作討論也、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　就海軍談判美國首席代表台維斯左右所得印象而言、海軍談話若在現行情勢之下再度舉行、則美國代表團不願提供任何諾言、接受任何約束、至關於各國相互通知海軍造艦程序一層、美國代表團自承無討論之資格謂當由外交途徑考慮之、美國代表團現已摒擋一切、俾於十二月二十九日自沙善墩港啟程、搭乘喬治華盛頓號輪船返國、在美國代表團啟程之前、英美日三國代表將舉行全體會議一次、開會時間當在日本宣告廢止華盛頓海軍條約之前、大約卽係本月二十日、是日將正式宣佈海軍談話延期舉行、並發表公報、）十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日派佐藤赴英</h3>
<p>增强代表團陳勢</p>
<p>英日妥恊案内容</p>

<p>（倫敦）　關於英日妥恊試案之情形、綜合各處情報、查悉其大致内容如左、</p>
<p>（一）各國政府須各將其造艦計畫、在五年間漸次减少、其宣言之内容係闡明各艦種類由質量雙方之造艦計畫、及造代用艦艇與緩造代艦等等細節、但完全出於自主、並不加以任何國際上之拘束、且不得留存比率主義之痕跡、（二）根據攻擊的兵力與防禦的武器之區别、認爲前者有分别艦種之均等、至於後者則由總噸數主義、而考慮各國國防之特異情形、（甲）關於主力艦·航空母艦·甲等巡洋艦·雖可確認分别艦種之平等、而於現實上則英日兩國之海軍力因有相差之處、欲待其逹到均勢、事實上必需相當年限、故考慮上項事實、則今後數年例如五年或十年間之造艦階段、應由日本政府自行宣布、（乙）在乙等巡洋艦以下之防禦兵器、可由總噸數主義而承認其根據國防特異性所需之兵力、例如英國政府甲乙兩等巡洋艦共計七十艘、内中現有甲等巡洋艦十五艘及乙等大巡洋艦十艘、自應維持並承認其七千噸以下之四十五艘、日本政府維持其潛水艦之現有勢力七萬八千噸、亦須承認、因此據倫敦條約所規定、日本政府至一九三六年年底爲止、雖有削减潛水艦至五萬三千七百噸之義務、而於妥恊試案則承認維持上項噸數及及其代用艦艇、（三）對於造艦計畫設定最高限度之提案、英國政府不欲故作反對、大致對於攻擊的武器减質三成、主力艦二萬五千噸·航空母艦二萬噸·巡洋艦七千噸、由减質所得之噸數、可通融於巡洋艦、再將現有勢力削减幾分之數字、决定於最高限度、蓋設立共同最大限度、則法意兩國亦非承認其均等不可、是以英國政府擬設法要求變更共同最大限度之觀念、而其宣言則全然脫離比率主義之縛束、此乃妥恊試案中潛在之苦心也云、美國代表對於上項妥恊試案、雖尙未表示贊同、然英日兩國代表間倘製成具體方案時、則美國代表團亦未便孤立於超然境外、是無待言、故英國政府當局現仍期待美國代表團必可參加妥恊試案、於是此項妥恊試案乃成爲支配預備會商今後之動向者也云、（十七日日聯電）</p>

<h3>從排華的見解想到他們的友敵</h3>
<p>周啟剛</p>
<p>晚近各地排華的聲息、傳到我們耳朶中或表現到我們的面前，其聲浪好像一天高了一天，歸納的說來，其内容不外兩種：（一）是因爲這幾年世界經濟恐慌，閙得没有辦法，於是以强力奪取的眼光來像徵一切，故對於華僑發生一種局部的誤解。（二）是忘記了歷史的事實，忽略了人類生存的相互條件、以至倒果爲因，妄想鼓動。</p>
<p>從前者說：道幾年來的世界經濟恐慌，實在和從前資本主義週期恐慌的性質，大不相同，無論在恐慌的程度上，範圍上，繼續性上，都是將恐慌的基礎建築在一般危機上面的。從資本主義的國家而影響到殖民地的農業經濟，使他也和資本主義國家的恐慌合着一個節奏，陷入於不景氣的深淵裏面。在這種經濟恐慌氣氛下所籠罩着的地方，自然是商人破産，工人失業，農民站在飢餓綫上了。而他們同樣的是受着破産，失業，和飢餓的痛苦，但眼看着華僑那一種具有特殊性的耐勞苦幹。仍能在惡劣環境底下來掙扎生存，往往就不能够克服人類那種卑下意識的妒嫉，會盲目的把满腔的怨恨，推移到華僑身上來，以爲世界事物是在奪取的，不是勞力所獲酬報的。於是華僑的農工商業都爲了不勞作而生活者所懨惡，因而引起一種不满於華僑的心理。這種下意識的嫉砳念頭發生，令到大家都要遭受莫大的損失，或許排華比較厲害的地方，所遭受的損失更大。</p>
<p>在這不景氮當中，華僑方面所受的損失，據去年我國移出的人口來計，祇有十三萬二千人，而歸國的華僑，則有二十七萬八千人，一年間就减少十四萬六千人，華僑匯欵回國之數，也大减特减，去年竟從二億元左右，减少了百分之八十至九十。華僑及我國國民經濟上所受到重大的損失，固無可諱言，而各居留地所受的損失亦在不少，尤以排華的地方，其經濟狀况益陷危殆，這種倒果爲因的見解，只有自損　氣，愈弄愈糟！</p>
<p>華僑的犧牲，固是華僑的代價，然而據我們所計算，華僑所獲的，是否適合其代價，這是成爲問題的；且其代價的結果，别的民族，能否與較，恐怕又成問題了。據年來的統計，華僑人數約有八百萬至一千萬，以人數年代死亡來計算，假定現存華僑一千萬，我們的僑胞歷年在海外的死亡，至少有數倍，則華僑因致力海外而犧牲者總有數千萬，再就華僑人口數字來計較金錢的所獲，就以最高的數字，每年華僑匯欸回國亦不過二萬萬（其實此種數字的時間不過三二年的光景）以一千萬的人，每年所獲的金錢二萬萬，平均每人每年所獲不過二十元，以華僑每日工作勞力鐘點之多，已比任何民族特長，每年實得二十元之酬報，質言之，每一個華僑在居留地工作一年，値價二十元，如是的收穫，持排華論的人們，實可省悟。</p>
<p>因爲人類彼此誤解，所以造成歷史上許多的悲劇，排華這件事，也不得不說是人類間由誤解而發生的不幸事件之一。我們甚願排華觀念的改正，非特我們應有的希望，亦且爲世界各國所不可忽略的一個切要的事情。</p>
<p>從後者說，華僑的造就，决不是偶然的，强奪的，華僑的所穫，不是代價優厚的，更不是單方利益的，如果人們不是將歷史事實遺忘，人類生存相互條件忽略，排華的觀念，不會發生，亦不致同受損害了；本來華僑移殖各地的史蹟，知者不少，但我們爲明白事理計，約爲追述：</p>
<p>（一）交通訪問時期丨丨漢代張騫之通西域，馬援之臨交趾，晉法顯僧之南游，及鄭和之出使等·是爲交通訪問時期。</p>
<p>（二）避政遷徒時期丨丨自明至淸，國人因政治不寗，相率遷徒海外者甚多，國律有禁止移住海外條文，淸代仍嚴其禁，是爲避政遷徒時期。</p>
<p>（三）工商貿易時期丨丨十六世紀至十九世紀，英荷兩屬均取自由移民政策，以求荒土之開發，對於華工延攬甚切，且有擄華人前往工作之事。在十九紀初葉，美國加省等地，發現金鑛，中美又因築路需要華工甚殷，南美也在這時招致華工入境。直到一八一五年後。</p>
<p>我國始與英法等暫訂明文，准許國人向海外自由移住，可說是工商貿易時期。</p>
<p>最値得我們注意的，就是第三時期丨丨工商貿易時期。因爲這時期是華僑向海外發展的極盛時期，也是華僑犧牲最大，貢獻最大的時期，如十六世紀時，荷人因開闢南洋缺乏適當的勞工，乃不惜以種種手段，羅致華工移入。其中最奇特的，就是「猪仔」之買賣及强奪。一六二三年荷屬東印度第一任總督苦恩氏（coen）曾有函致其後任之總督云：</p>
<p>「巴逹維亞，摩鹿加，安班瀾，萬逹，需人工甚多······世界中無如華人更適我用者······貿易旣不能以友誼得，現在風候正好，可即遣戰船往中國口岸，盡量捕其男女幼童以歸······特須多捕華人······」</p>
<p>由上的函，可見當時殖民地政府對於開發南洋，不惜以盧刧手段，强奪華人前往工作之一般，南洋是這樣，他如巴西，秘魯，澳洲等地之開闢，何嘗不是以「猪仔」逾運的方法呢？雖然有位英國人說過：「要是没有華僑恐怕也就不會有現在的馬來亞」。華僑聽到這句話，决不是誇功喜幸之感，倒反覺得一陳陳地難過，使他不得不追憶到我們華僑祖先在海外從血路中開拓之慘痛的經過。</p>
<p>據南洋華僑通史一八零頁所載，前南洋開闢某山塲，約計半年可竣力，乃招致「猪仔」（華工）五十名，不料半年之内，生存者僅二名，其他四十八名，則因勞役及病疫而死，山塲之墾荒，尙未及半，乃再羅致五十名「猪仔」以充實之。又經半年，始竣功，但第二批之「猪仔」亦僅存十四名。合計一百名「猪仔」開闢一山塲，一年中更死八十四名之多，如并及南洋，中南美，澳洲等地所開闢之各山塲總計之，那末，犧牲華僑生命之多，恐怕不是任何金元之數字，所可以表示出來的，如果不從殖民史中華僑慘淡經營。犧牲的經過來觀察，是不會理解現代經濟繁榮過程之内幕的。</p>
<p>華僑對於當地開闢及繁榮之貢獻如何，由上述之歷史過程，總可知到大槪。這樣看來，主張排華論者本可小休，不過，現在人類的奔競，一天一天向矛盾的道路上走，華僑所受的待遇，有些地方反得倒果爲因，我們亦相信今之倡排華論者，未必完全不讀史記的人，但他們又會忽略了人類生存的相互條件，以致誤會華僑的努力是「死奪」者，而不知華僑在地方上努力是一個「生予」者，我們希望他們最後有明瞭的機會丨（未完）</p>

<h3>昨晨哈佛輪被撞沉没</h3>
<p>由暹羅運洋米進口</p>
<p>在浦東陸家嘴江面</p>
<p>與同德輪迎面互撞</p>
<p>船貨損失船員無恙</p>
<p>本埠四川路六號美順行代理香港伍廣濟隆經理挪威輪哈佛號、Ｈerver自暹羅盤谷、裝洋米一萬六千五百包、計一千七百噸、該米爲本埠華商所購辦、該輪先到香港、再來上海、昨晨七時十五分、船到吳淞、旋卽進口、開入浦江、準備到義泰興碼頭起卸、八時四十五分、駛抵外白渡橋對江陸家嘴江面、與本埠漢口路大發行代理同德公司同德輪互撞、發生沉没慘劇、</p>
<p>兩船碰撞　同德輪、昨晨係放空船、由滬開赴靑島裝煤、早晨八時四十五分、駛抵陸家嘴江面、自南向北、轉向東行、適値哈佛輪自東向西、轉南開行、兩輪遂至相値、查該處水勢最激、此時又値漲潮、同德與哈佛兩輪、行近時、雙方又均未拉汽笛、一刹那間、同德船頭猛撞哈佛輪頭艙左舷、砰然一聲、巨禍遂成、</p>
<p>哈佛沉没　哈佛輪船頭左舷外、被撞一大洞、損傷在裝貨水綫之下、江水卽冲進頭艙、船頭立時下沉、更因满裝洋米、壓力過巨、船身失去浮托能力、霎時間二三四艙亦各浸水、未及半小時、便在陸家嘴江面下沉、初時全身台甲尙露水面、及至午後、前中各艙台甲、亦没入江中、祇透露一船尾在浦江矣、</p>
<p>船員獲救　出事後、江海關與陸家嘴水巡捕房、急派利海鏡輝小火輪、及舢板等、到陸家嘴、先將哈佛輪内生火水手三十一名、又船主大二副老軌等共十三人、設法救起、暫行留居捕房、嗣由廣濟隆上海辦事處、及美順行經理曾廣頃等設法、先將各船員收容、暫時命在滬上各旅棧内棲息、以待船東電報、再定辦法、故哈佛輪全部船員水手、無一損害、</p>
<p>船體拖擱　美順行得到哈佛輪失事報告、卽由曾廣頃向會德豐磋商、派拖輪兩艘、至陸家嘴、以該處爲航輪出入要道、哈佛沉輪、殊足妨碍航路、故乘漲潮時、將該輪漸漸拖進、到陸家嘴水巡捕房側春江碼頭附近之浦東岸較淺處、將輪擱住、在沉船外擋、由兩拖輪夾持、以免沉入江心</p>
<p>沉輪標幟　哈佛沉輪處、各方船隻、行駛頗感不便、該輪船員、卽於兩桅桿頂、高懸綠旗四面、以資警告、入晚則另懸紅燈、以避行舟衝撞、行駛該處春銅綫之市渡輪、因浦東春江碼頭之出路、適被沉輪擋住、故祇得繞道而駛、晚間更感不便、</p>
<p>派員檢騐　美順輪船公司、接哈佛輪報告後、卽派副經理李志一赴同德輪船公司飭派騐船師前往查勘同時設法打撈船内所裝洋米、當時同德輪船公司接報告後、卽派騐船師赴陸家嘴角失事地點查勘俟該騐船師報告後、再行核辦關於撞碰之責任問題、此事尙須由雙方聘請公正入檢騐、並傳集兩輪船員等訊問後、方可確定、目前則不能斷定、故雙方均不願有所表示也、</p>
<p>損失數額　哈佛輪登記噸爲七百六十一噸、裝貨噸爲二千噸、於一千九百二十一年上海瑞鎔造船廠所造、長二百四十二呎七吋、闊三十七呎二吋、深十五呎、一層艙係挪威商所有、由廣濟隆木行承租裝盤谷米一千六百噸、約計一萬六千五百包、價値二十餘萬元、船身約値二十餘萬元、總計損失四十餘萬元、至於同德輪之損失、尙不在内、哈佛輪船身、由上海挪威商順亨洋行經理、向挪威國保險行保平安險二十萬元、所裝之米、向英商紐西倫保險公司保平安險二十萬元、昨已由美順公司通告廣濟隆木行、分别電知所保船身及貨物之兩保險公司、</p>

<p>胡嫂子道，你這是怎樣的說話，人家賈老爺正正經經的問你話，你倒是這樣的答應人家嗎？賈多才搖着手笑道：不要緊，不要緊，這是他害臊，不是不睬我，凑巧，我就最愛着姑娘們害臊的樣子，你就多多的害臊一會子罷。說着哈哈大笑起來。笑完了，他在身上掏出一隻扁平的烟捲盒子來。月英偷看時，見那盒子白得放光，倒有些奇異。胡嫂子道：賈老爺，你這盒子是银子打的吧？多少重？賈多才道：一兩多一點。胡嫂子道：姑娘，你聽聽，連烟盒子都是銀子打的。一兩多銀子，我可以吃三個月糧食。賈多才笑道：要是那樣比，那還能說什麽。往東方去，把金子打一個烟盒子，也很平常呢。月英雖是聽到祖母說過，湖南原籍，是如何的享福，銀子打的香烟盒子，却是没有聽到說過，不想今天親自看到了，因爲心裏是如此的想着，不免又微微抬了頭，向賈多才手上去看着。賈多才手裏拿了根香烟，不住的在盒子上頓着，眼睛正射到月英的臉上，月英抬起頭來，却好四目相射。月英立刻笑着低下頭去。賈多才便將兩個指頭夾了那根烟，送到他面前去，笑道：你不抽根烟。月英抬起手臂，横隔了賈多才的手，微微的搖着頭。胡嫂子道，傻孩子，傻孩子，你就是不抽烟，你也該站起來接着，這個樣子，不是太不懂禮貌嗎？站起來，站起來。月英也覺得這位老爺是眞正的有錢，假如就把這條身子都賣給他，全家人都活命了。對這個人是應當客氣點，不能够得罪的。（九二）</p>
<h3>閱報室素描</h3>
<p>— 基爵</p>
<p>大學的閱報室眞有許多不平凡，無論在形式上實際上觀察，早，午，晚三個時期十小時之内便已變化倐忽，不勝滄桑之感哩：照例，當天報紙送進學府來，經過郵務處的敏捷分派，再由圖書館分發出來陳列到閱報室，幾經輾轉，已是上午九點多鐘了。「報紙是人生的精神食糧」，大學生對於這種必需品酷愛的程度或許更能深切一些。因此當報紙未到之先，已有一羣人鵠候在閱報室門前，或者竟不耐地走進空曠的室中往來躑躅着，及等圖書館茶房把報紙送來夾好，就此大家一擁而上各向其所愛好的報紙方面去，凝神閱讀，别無異動，這可算大學閱報室的黃色時代之一刹那！</p>
<p>千餘人集合的學校社會，不但形式上够稱繁複；每個人的心理，每個人的愛好，甚至每個人的行動，都顯具着極大的分野，造成了難以統計的異點。閱報室在這紛紜狀况之下，其變化乃是當然的。報紙陳列了不满一小時，便發現開着很多的天窗，某種副刋竟不翼而飛了丨丨那就是偷報的開始：愛好文學的朋友以副刋爲對象，注意於國際問題及國家大事者以時評及國際新聞爲對象，愛看電影的朋友以電影專刋爲對象······各擇所好，分而取之：更有研究新聞學的「準記者」，連稍爲出色點的標題也剪裁了去。</p>
<p>時間一幕一幕地過去，由早而午，而晚，截至夜間九點鐘，閱報室的十多份報紙，其肥美可食者皆歸烏有，賸下枞的僅是一些不堪下箸的「鷄肋，」如同沙塲上陳列着的不完全的屍首一般，由着圖書館的茶房來做「收屍」工作。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （姚狂生）</p>
<p>人生道上，愈是曲折崎嶇，愈覺得有味。倘然眞個一帆風順，實在不足以展其創造之能；天才之美；一個人未嘗艱苦，那裏知道樂之爲樂呢？身居安樂窩中，自己不知是福；正似豬八戒吃人參果，食而不知其味；亦似古畫贈與種田人；美人贈與强盜；有了寳貝，他那裏懂得欣賞受用；此等人之一生，就此錯過，眞正可惜的很。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>經過了這樣的一番巡禮，不但是太后的心上非常悲痛，便是我們這些關係較淺的人，也覺得無限的傷感，人雖然是不能不死，但死了之後，他們的遺物却往往會逗起後的無限的哀思，眞也是一件很不痛快的事情！</p>
<p>太后回到了伊的便殿上來之後，便獨自靜悄悄地坐着歇息，方才所感受到的一番沉鬱的印象，兀自在伊的腦際　迴着。我們都一齊退出來了，祇留一個當値的女官侍候着伊。</p>
<p>我也在退値休息之列，但我的身體實在並不曾如何勞動，所以倒絶不覺得疲乏，祇是胸中異常煩悶，却眞想閑散一會；不料光緒又給我增添了一重煩悶。當他瞧見左近没有人注意的時候，突然悄悄地向我說道：</p>
<p>「我可以給你保證！在這些古舊的宮院中，無論到什麽時候，總不會有紀念我的東西收藏着的！」他一面說，一面發出一種比哭還難看的苦笑。「我現在有什麽東西呢？那一件東西可以說是屬于我的？將來是更不會有了」！</p>
<p>說完，他就掩着臉，輕輕地走了。</p>
<p>本來，天空中還是一片明凈的陽光，現在却像給一重烏雲罩住了，眼前所見的只是黑暗，愁苦，幽鬱。（二○二）</p>
<h3>火燭小心</h3>
<p>章玉卿</p>
<p>氣候的輪子不停地的旋轉着，挺進了冬的季節！雾圍的四周，祇是靜寂和凄冷。寒暑表上的水銀管子縮到了最低層，像透不出氣來似的。十二月季節的風，氣候末的雨和雪，好像是專爲向窮人團裏侵襲而造下的。</p>
<p>果眞天氣漸漸地冷了起來，一天厲害一天，正是冷得一般的窮人們没命時，加上了破棉衣還是在抖擻。然而，不和空氣相接觸的高貴的人們，他們是覺不得天氣已轉到了冷的光景。也許是因爲今年的炎夏天，有超過了六十年來的奇熱的原故，於是以借得過街樓下作旅店的乞丐們，都在咒詛着上帝，在季節的循環的輪兒上何必在有冬呢！</p>
<p>「寒冬臘月，火燭小心，」在他們羣裏的幾個老前輩，想到了這件常年舊慣的生意經，於是重復地又回到了甘甜的快樂中。</p>
<p>不錯，這種没本錢的生意，眞是値得做。旣不費財，又不吃力，祇要在黃昏人靜的時分，兜上幾圈，喊脫兩聲「寒冬臘月，火燭小心。」隔上幾天，便可挨門挨户的去討錢，到那時候，一般平日不肯布施的人家也會破鈔些了。當然，盡了義務應該要享權利的。</p>
<p>由此，我們便得聯想到，一個人生存在社會上，若要維持其可憐的生命，那是多麽地不易哪！非但要具有機警的頭腦，靈敏的思想，而且還得要有相當的歷史和地位！更須適合他人的需要。</p>

<h3>小銅匠擔的故事</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>日前本刋淸癯君記金餛飩擔事：說及本埠城内四牌樓陳姓，從前也是挑銅匠擔爲業。後來發跡致富，其子孫特製小銅匠擔一具，安置家堂裏，留作紀念云云：至其致富之原因，略而不詳。在下和程姓有葭莩之誼，知之較爲明晰，現在不妨也來談談。</p>
<p>程姓地址，並非四牌樓，實係××牌樓。其中房屋寛大，共有數房，都聚族而居。其祖先程某，是做銅匠的。性勤儉，有一天，挑着銅匠擔子，走過一家破落户的門首。那人家在廳堂裏，有幾塊銅方磚，要賣給他。他就出很便宜的代價，換了下來。回到家裏，仔細一看，原來都是燦爛的金質。他發了這横財，眞是喜從天上來。這時地産又賤，於是廣置業産。一時有「程半城，朱一角。」之　：這就是說姓程的房産，比姓朱的還多。不過到了現在，這兩句話，久已不成問題了。後來子孫爲紀念先人起見，特製一副小銅匠擔，至今還陳列在門樓上面咧。</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>歐美之典當業</h3>
<p>— 方正平</p>
<p>歐美當業，大别之可分三種：一爲採用私營主義者，如英·美·兩國是也；二爲採用公營主義者，如法·比·意等國是了；三爲採公營曁私營主義者，如德·奥·銀國是也。茲分别述其槪要如次：</p>
<p>（一）英吉利</p>
<p>英國私營當舖，由市鎭村自治團體監察外，並須向内國稅務官領取執照，年輸七鎊十先令之執照費。其所取利率，自年利百分之四至百分之八。外加手數料自半便士至一便士。满當期限爲一年又七日。满期後，凡價値半鎊以下之貨物，其所有權歸當舖，半鎊以上者，須用競賣法脫售，在满期以後競賣以前之期間，當户仍得贖回，競賣所得之値超過當本及利息等費時其餘額應歸當户；但在一年以内，同一當户之满貨有折損出售者，其損失得由餘利内補償之。凡因火災或過失所致之損失，當舖内負賠償之責。</p>
<p>（二）美國</p>
<p>美國當業，由各州政府爲之監督，辦法頗不一致。大槪開設之前，均須繳費領照，並出具保證。利率約分兩種：其一按當本大小而高下；其二不論當本大小而有一律之標準。其大小一律者，月利自百分之一至百分之八，以新墨西哥州爲最低，台拉懷萊州爲最高；其按當本高下者，則以紐約州爲著稱。分美金百元以下及百元以上兩種。前者最初六個月内月利百分之三，厥後百分之二，前者最初六個月内月利百分之二，厥後百分之一，他如梅恩及佛及尼亞兩洲，亦按當本取利者也。利息以外，對於特種物品，亦有徵收手數科者，满當期限，亦不一致。有明定者，有雙方約定者。出售满貨之於利，也須還當户，如當户不請求返還，則大槪由政府没收。當舖對於火災損失，應負賠償全部或一部之責，亦有須事前保險，以防萬一者。此外慈善團設立當舖者，在美國頗稱發逹，由州政府特許可免營業捐稅，亦獎勵之一道也。</p>
<p>（三）法蘭西</p>
<p>法國當業之公營，濫觴於十九世紀之初，至一八五一五年，仍得法律之確定。而私營當舖槪行禁絶。是年頌佈法蘭西公設當局法，至今猶屬有效。公設當舖設董事會，以市鎭長爲議長。董事爲名譽職，由市縣長任命，每年更換三分之一。當物利率，每年自百分之三至百分之七，满貨期限，大槪以一年爲例，满貨餘利，應歸還持票人，其餘持票人請求者，亦須保存三年，方得没收，作爲剩餘財産之一部。如遇損失，當局應負責質物價値三分之一之賠償。</p>
<p>（四）比利時</p>
<p>一八四八年以後，比國公營當業當局悉歸市營。局中董事由市鎭村長任命。營業資金，大都爲市民所醵出。當物利率，以年利百分之十五爲限。而以一年爲满期，然須候满期後十三個月，須得將满貨脫售。買賣之前一日，當户仍得贖取。售貨如貫，以百分之五爲率，以充利息及手續費。有餘額時，須還質户。除不可抗力外，質物損失，均由當局賠償。並加莫二分之一作爲償金。</p>
<p>（五）意大利</p>
<p>意大利爲公營當業最早之國，各國爭相取法。公當資本，多由捐助而來。利率按月自百分之五至百分之七；未满五里拉之賀物，不取利息。满期以六月爲例；但得轉換方法，延長至五年之久。满期後兩週間得將满貨脫售。有餘額時，須返還質户焉。（未完）</p>

<h3>留日學生激增多未照部定手續出國</h3>
<p>資格經濟多未合爲目前嚴重問題</p>
<p>周憲文曾與敎育部討論變通辦法</p>
<p>本年度中國留日學生、據日華學會調查、總計有二千三百餘人之多、較去年增加一倍、上海社記者、昨向本埠寰球學生會方面、探得其激增原因、及出國手續不符部定情形如次、</p>
<p>留日學生激增原因　留日學生人數激增之原因、爲日金低落、在二三年以前、每一日金合國幣二元有餘、現在則每一日金祇抵國幣八角餘、相差甚距、我國一般比較淸寒之學生、認爲大好機會、故相率赴日、以求深造、本度赴日學生二千餘人中、以入早稻田大學、及明冶大學爲最多、所學科目、則大多係社會科學、</p>
<p>出國手續未照部定　敎部原定學生留日手續、必須在專科以上學校畢業、在經濟上並須有積存二年費用、存入中交銀行、由銀行出具證明書、然後方得領取留學證書、本年度留日學生中、在資格及經濟方面、不合敎部規定者甚多、故多數未照部定辦理出國手續、往往直接赴日、此爲目前一嚴重問題、留日學生監督周憲文氏、前曾回國與敎部討論變通辦法、但迄未有解决云、</p>

<h3>一九三四年度日本文壇的新人</h3>
<p>— 凡海</p>
<p>今年在日本文壇上露頭角的新人有島木健作，平田小六，佐佐木一夫，阿蘇弘，橋本正一，島田和夫，藤島馬起，草刈六郎，杉山奈凹江，楊逵，木村淸治，莊司重夫等等。</p>
<p>這些新人中，最有成績的是島木健作和平田小六。島木健作的「獄」可以說是一九三四年度日本文壇的壓卷石，他一跳出來，馬上便在日本文壇上得到很大的贊譽。附在「獄」中的另外五篇「癩」，「盲目」，「苦悶」，「轉落」，「醫者」都同樣是獄中生活之模範的描寫，所以島木健作可以說是今年日本文壇上第一個有名的新人。</p>
<p>和島木健作相並而成爲今年日本文壇上之雙壁的就是平田小六了。他是一九三四年日本農民文學的惟一代表者。原來日本的農村之破産已陷入極悲慘的境地。所以今年日本文壇上描寫農村的文章差不多佔满了文壇的地位，農民文學差不多就是一九三四年日本文學的主要面、而農民文學中之最優秀的一個便是平田小六了。</p>
<p>佐佐木一夫是農民作家中的農民作家。他的「没落後」是無可否認的一篇最健康的作品。他自己是出身農村的，他在泥土，肥料和汗水中呼吸着，寫出鈍重而不失單純與明快的農民自己的作品。</p>
<p>阿蘇弘是和林房雄共著「少年」的。所謂共著這事在各國文壇上還不多見，這也是今年日本文壇上値得紀念的。</p>
<p>島田和夫發表的一篇作品是「馬糞之街」，一個自由勞働組合的書記是主人公，據說就是作者自己，他寫這篇作品是有相當野心的。</p>
<p>藤島馬起，也可譯作藤島卷，一看就知道是個女人的名字了。她發表「命」和「赤剥」，在女性中像那樣用粗大的綫條描寫作品的實在没有見過。</p>
<p>日本文壇上今年還有一個農民文學之外的另一特殊現象，那便是描寫殖民地的文學。在日本，過去本來也有描寫殖民地的文學的，不過由殖民地人自身描寫的，却只到今年才有了更進一層的意義。這裏楊逵和草刈六郎便是代表的作家。楊逵是描寫台灣農民的，草刈六郎描寫朝鮮的勞働者，這兩個描寫日本殖民地的下層階級的作家將會使漸漸移向描寫小布爾喬亞生活的朝鮮作家張赫宙有了更强一層的意向吧？</p>
<p>最後杉山奈凹江也是一個女作家，她還是一個綿紗工廠的女工，在今年日本文壇上盡是描寫農民的文學佔着地位時，描寫工廠勞働者的作家，差不多只有杉山奈凹江一人，所以杉山奈凹江也是今年日本文壇的一支異軍。她描寫工廠内的作業狀態，那樣明澈，變化多端而又不重複，實在是値得贊賞的。到現在，勞働者出身的作家能像她一樣正確地描寫工塲内的作業狀態，並不用特殊的事故而報告出平凡而又有趣的工塲中的一日的作家實在是不多見的。她的作品中不但没有觀念的政治主義的傷痕，而且也没有女性作家特有的感傷癖和感情昂奮等毛病，在新人中，這作家是最有希望的一個。</p>
<h3>東京夜市</h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>在我未到東京以前，就聽過關於東京夜市是怎樣熱閙的話說了。到東京以後，自己走去一看，覺得也還「名副其實」。不過我到東京的日子還不多，所以我一共只逛了三次夜市，最初二次是跟老俞　「走馬看花」似的只一刻就回來了，第三次是同着蘭寳，姚曼等逛了不少的時間，而且還買了一點東西。東京每一個熱閙的塲所都有夜市，如淺草，銀座，新宿，······等處，現在我所說的只單是新宿一處的夜市。</p>
<p>記得是在前一個星期六的晚上，吃了晚飯後，我們這一羣，每個人都帶着興奮的情緒從東中野驛搭了車向着目的地跑，大槪因爲是星期六晚上吧，車廂裏比平時更擠擁满了人，車過了二站就到了新宿，人走出了車站就覺得不同了，到處都是紅的燈，綠的燈，紫色的燈，白熱化的燈，在閃着，飛着，跳着，汽車像黑螞蟻一樣的在馬路上列隊走着，兩傍行人道的行人你擠來，我擠去，眞是所謂「水洩不通」了。</p>
<p>馬路的兩傍擺满着許多小灘子，每個小灘子都有布蓬，賣着日常的應用品以及小孩子的玩具等等，也有廉價的舊書，油畫，與畫片等。我們走到一處油畫灘子前面就停了步。</p>
<p>「買幾張油畫吧！」蘭寳說，說了以後自己就先蹲下一張張地在翻看着。</p>
<p>我看見價錢便宜，而且油畫又好，於是我就買了四張，蘭寳買了二張，我買的有一張三個小孩子。在小溪畔上洗脚的，蘭寳說很好，結果我送給她了</p>
<p>我們慢慢地走着，看着各色各種的東西，眞像什麽總司令閱兵那麽地，忽然看見一個乞丐坐在路傍，姚說：「這裏一個乞丐！」她帶點稀奇的口吻說。眞的，我們到東京後只看見這個乞丐、而且他是殘廢了的，日本雖然也有整千整萬個的窮人，但做乞丐的倒很少，拿這種情形和上海一比，上海就太慚愧了！</p>
<p>我們一面走着，一面買了許多好玩的物件，蘭寳買了一個小洋囡囡，她笑着說：「我家裏已有了一個洋囡囡了，我恐她寂寞，所以再買了這個來伴着她！」這句話把胖大姊笑得眼睛像條黑線。</p>
<p>走着，走着，走了許多路，大公司裏也去過，地下室也去過，直到九點鐘左右才興盡回來。</p>
<p>「東京的夜市是閙人的，也是迷人的！」我此刻這麽想着。</p>
<h3>「看汽車」</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>牛痘和麻藥</h3>
<p>— 喬峯</p>
<p>人類在没有文字，或没有歷史的記載以前，已經發見和發明過許多有用的東西和方法，如火的用途，取火的方法，工具，以及治病的藥材等許多東西，如果一一寫下來，這張單子應當非常之長。有了成文的歷史以後，於人類有益的東西也陸續有的發見，新工具也隨時有的發明，種牛痘的方法和麻藥不過是許多中間的二種，但是它們的益處很大，這里提出來說說，不是没有意思的。</p>
<p>近幾天來，看見路上或車上張貼着呌人種牛痘的紙頭，可見天花又將要來了。天花本是一種傳染病，而且是性命交關的病。流行的地域極廣，死亡的人數也極多。它每年春天常要流行起來；小孩傳染了固然危險，即使不傳染，也仍然是一件很担心的事情；因爲不出過天花的人，將來仍會傳染，危險還是不能免除的。因此在未發明牛痘之先，許多地方用天花的痂塞在鼻孔裏，使兒童在指定的時期傳染一次天花。然而種花的方法並不能免除天花所含有的危險性，雖然略輕些。直到種牛痘的方法發明以後，此種危險方才除去了。</p>
<p>牛痘的發見者是勤納，時期在一七九八年間。勤納名呌愛特華，生於一七四九年，（死於一八二三年），是一個英國格羅斯忒郡的醫生。格羅斯忒郡是養牛很多的地方，牛也能生一種和天花相似的病，生這病時，乳房上是要發生水泡的。擠牛乳的人有時傳染了，他只發現一種輕微的症狀，以後便不感染天花了。因此格羅斯忒郡的擠牛奶的人們中有一種信念：便是傳染過牛痘之後是可以防避天花的。勤納生長在那裏，這種情形自然知道得很詳細。</p>
<p>勤納二十一歲的時候，跑到倫敦去學醫，就在享德的指導之下學習解剖學。享德是蘇格蘭人，在解剖學和外科醫學上是極有名的明星。勤納便把出過牛痘可以免天花傳染的事情告訴享德。但是享德事情太忙，没有功夫來研究這問題。於是這項試騐研究終落在勤納的肩上了。</p>
<p>他學醫之後，再來研究他的本鄉的擠乳人的信念。經過他的試騐和研究，他深信用牛痘漿種在人體，症狀很輕微，然而可以防禦天花的。一七九六年，他把牛痘種在人體上，只發輕微的病狀，便回復了健康。他再取天花種在同這一個人的身上，結果並不發生天花。這才使他愈加相信牛痘可以防禦天花了。又二年後，便是一七九八年，他遂把他的大發見發表出來，告訴世界知道。</p>
<p>到了近年，引種牛痘的方法已很通行，天花已比從前稀少得多了。並且知道：牛痘並不是一種奇秘的東西，只是天花的變相。是因天花的微生物，經過牛體之後，便减少了它的猛烈性，再把它引種在人體裏，遂不致發生危險的症候，但是身體内同樣能够發生抗毒作用，用以抵抗天花的微生物的繁生。如果把人的天花種在幼穉的雌牛或兎的身上，它們也能發生牛痘，這可以瞪明前說的話是對的。</p>
<h3>駝鈴</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>在南國的朋友寫信來說，不知是怎麽閙的，在他的夢響時常看見成羣的駱駝在不見邊際的沙漠行着，風來時，空中揚满了塵沙，駝鈴重濁地在空氣裏押着。這夢一個連一個把他引到了幻境，駝鈴的音響終日要在他耳畔輕晃着。</p>
<p>是的，在淸晨，天還黎明時，這些黃色的龐大的朋友們跟着牠們的主人在早寒中啟行，一頭尾隨着一頭，默默地跨着沉重的步子，背脊上抗着幾百斤的重負，煤，石灰柴火······除了這之外，還有大布袋裏的乾草，小布袋裏的饝餹，那是畜牲自己知它主人的糧食。在走過了一個長長的路程之後，駱駝與人全餓了，便會寂然地停了下來，四隻茸茸的毛腿輕跥去灰塵，前膝跪了下來，待主人把食糧放到它們眼前時，那蠢然的厚唇開始蠕動，把個眼緊瞅着天。</p>
<p>頸項下的鈴子搖着，除了駱駝的咬嚼聲與主人嚥着乾　　的嗆咳外，這是唯一的音籟了。這音調是輕輕地𢌞盪着，像水紋一樣播散開去，娛樂着畜牲們自己和娛樂着那啃着嚥着的满臉風霜的主人們。</p>
<p>在碰到了另一隊時、大家揮揮鞭子，主人們像騎兵隊的隊長一樣威武地，交換着一個同僚的笑顔。</p>
<p>「趕得早哇丨丨哦，眞是幾頭好牲口！」趕駝人總如騎士愛端詳馬匹般在留神着人家的牲口。</p>
<p>「百十來塊錢一頭哩丨丨」擺着皮帽上的耳蓋昂然地走了過去，好像炫耀着自己的家財，這正如計算「牛羊多少頭」一樣的，也是私有財産之一。</p>
<p>趕駝人也有僅僅是服役性質的，自己並没有牲口，而是給人家拉。在這類性質的駝隊中，聽不到多少駝鈴的聲音，差不多已經省去，或者只有一隊的頭一隻的𩓐子下找得到，於是整隊的人和牲口便都聽着這點音節緩緩前行。隆起的峯背上，麻布袋或繩網在顚簸着。</p>
<p>「嘘丨丨」鞭子在空中揚了一下，漸漸鬆弛下來的脚前又快了起來，加足了馬力似的。</p>
<p>如果是在夏天，毒太陽底下躊躇着勤勞的牲口與勤勞的人，牲口們各自帶着重負，人却捧着一顆沉重的心和一個滴着汗粒的腦袋。丨丨駝鈴的音響像有點煩躁起來。</p>
<p>只有冬天，當人與牲口冒着氣飄在空氣裏像白烟一樣的時候，駝鈴的擺動裏溫暖着疲乏了的心。</p>
<p>這音波正暗示着一個堅毅的費盡了力氣的征途。</p>
<h3>明天（十九）</h3>
<p>— （Joseph　Cornad）著吴向隅譯</p>
<p>「他很勇敢地傾向前面。少許蒼白些：這面孔對於有些人是適合的。但你是有着一個女孩子的很美麗的身段，貝珊小姐。」</p>
<p>她又完全陷入惶恐狀態中了。因過去從來没有人講過這許多話。</p>
<p>他的語調又改變。「但是我已經餓得可以，今天没有吃過早飯。你能從放茶的地方找出一些麵包給我，或者丨」</p>
<p>她已經去了。他曾差不多要求她進去。有什麽要緊。隨便什麽地方都可以。見鬼，現在進退兩難了。他的伙伴將要全會當我在幹什麽呢？</p>
<p>「我不是像乞丐一樣向你討」他滑稽地說，他從她舉向他前面的盆子中拿了一片有奶油的麵包。我是像一個朋友一樣向你討。我的爸爸你曉得，是有錢的。</p>
<p>「他爲了你的原故寗願飢餓。」</p>
<p>「我却因爲他的奇怪的想頭受餓，」他說，同時拿起了另一片麵包。</p>
<p>「他在這世界上所有的一切都是爲你，」她反駁着說。</p>
<p>「是的，如果我以這兒來像一個受罰的坐在洞中蝦蟆一樣住下來。謝謝你；一把踿摔在頭上又將怎麽辦呢？他永遠有他的表現愛的奇怪方法。」</p>
<p>「我能够在一星期内呌他醒過來，」他膽小地建議。</p>
<p>「他因太餓的原故，不能回答她；她把盆子恭順的舉着靠近他的手，開始用一種快的氣急的聲音低語，剛使他能聽到。他聽着，有些驚奇，同時咀嚼逐漸慢下來，等到最後，他的牙床，完全停止下來。那是他的把戲，是麽？」他用非常輕視的提高的聲調說。一種不能抑制的手臂的揮動把那隻盆子從她的手指間飛開。他破口大駡。</p>
<p>她從他面前退縮轉來，把她的手倚靠在牆上。</p>

<p>昨日洋米市况、上午以定貨大批抵埠、人心甚軟、本客進胃甚呆、及正午後内地競辦碎米、本街則辦西貢暹邏機米、市形立見轉機、行情亦步砌五分、共計成交碎米機米各千餘包、定貨新到西貢二船、係公司船皮納溫、愛而特馬拉兩輪進口、現已泊卸義泰興機、共計五萬多包、又挪威船哈佛號裝暹邏米一萬五千四百四十五包、（一千五百噸）昨晨進口時在綠架子被同德輪撞沉、因此市上暹邏機碎各米均見挺俏云、</p>
<p>客秈市存略有、到頭亦續抵埠、去路本客均活、市面扯居平局、昨無錫及浙省内地辦去一千三百包、本街去一千七百包、行情與前市無不出入云、</p>
<h3>河下主旺到跌角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源忽湧、共到有六十餘號、貨共九千餘石、乃人心復虚、市色下垂、銷塲靑島威海衛天津等帮包胃續進七八百包、而大局終以到旺、呈供過于求、如各厚粳價貶落角許、晚稻行情修低數分至近角耳、而杜洋尖及陰元等各花色、更以去路不廣、續跌一二角不等也、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各貨到貨四十五六號、市上各色去胃白粳包胃拾巧稍進、零胃呆滯、早薄稻及各尖變陰元亦甚淸淡、市形白粳價小近角、餘貨帶疲、</p>
<h3>麩皮存銷兩不豐盛</h3>
<p>麩皮市面、日來平靜之至、因貨底雖不甚豐、外莊並未暢動、祇内地微有零星交易、價較前週微帶疲弱、雜牌麩喊二元七角、福新麩喊七角半云、</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>新海南赤首盤已開</p>
<p>昨日糖市平定、公會划盤、二四粗砂白現貨普通十八元四角、本棧貨十八元半、轉口五元二角、原價均有交易、八九號荷赤普通十四元、高九號十四元四角、轉口四元九角、亦無變動、太古糖Ｂ嘜十九元四角、本廠綿白振記振裕一號仍十七元七角、國産新海南赤首批到六十一包、貨品尙佳、當即開出、價爲十三元、新潮寗前晚由綏陽和生兩輪共到二千一百餘包、行方因走銷活潑、趨勢穩定、故所到之貨、當即如數開通、提莊靑爲十二元五六角、黃崗靑十二元三四角、次之二角、　港靑十二元、（按洋糖存底粗砂白荷赤均僅二萬餘包照昨金市高漲趨勢、後市防有上漲之可能、特先誌之以觀其後）茲將存糖數列後、</p>

<h3>病與醫</h3>
<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>「馬托卡」壞了要修理，人病了要醫，這是一樣「天經地義」的！</p>
<p>我没有這份福氣坐「馬托卡」，而病倒每年輪流到兩三至五六次不等，旣然如此，那麽還是來談談「病」與「醫」，因爲這比較是切身些的問題。何况，拾破布的小六子會扒在馬路上嚷肚子痛，靠在野鴨絨枕上的「少爺」有時亦要發幾個寒熱，病之於人，又是這樣平等不過的呢。</p>
<p>生病是人人怕的，吃藥亦不見得受人歡迎，自「乳臭未乾」的孩子到「鬚眉皆白」的老頭，生了病都要哼，生了眼睛不要看人的樣子，足見生病是很痛苦的事。「英雄只怕病來磨！」英雄尙且受不了，庸人更休想吃得消。所以不病則已，一病就要趕緊醫，究竟現在的醫生都是「存心濟世」的，一塊二角開一張湯頭方子，上面把你的脈案舌胎，大小便有無，開得明明白白、甘草幾錢，陳皮幾錢，你不要以爲第一帖吃下不見效，就有了不信任你那位醫生的心，據說，持重的醫生的第一張藥方是作「病情的試探」，於是，再一，二，三，四，···的逐步加以診治，雖然你多在牀上受幾天累和多化了幾塊錢，可並不寃枉，因爲他旣肯小心替你一天一天的醫下去，死總不至於的了。</p>
<p>没有涵養工夫的病家，大多相信四醫，因爲西醫是「靈不靈當塲出彩」的。他會在你大腿上刺一針，呌你如殺猪一般的呌起來，你腦袋覺得燙，他就給你兩個冰袋，你身子怕冷，他就替你生火，肚裏難過吃藥水，也許生個熱　會挖掉一塊肉，說者謂這樣似乎太欠忠厚，然而，「死去」，「活來」倒也不失爲「直截爽快」。</p>
<p>這樣看來，中西醫生，各有其好處矣。嘗見病家把中西醫一併請到家裏的，這大約是他家裏的錢該得多，多一種醫生，性命就多得一重保障，萬一到了「實病難醫」的時候，那麽亦好讓他的子孫在「哀啟」上說得響亮點，錢畢竟不會白化的。但是，還有一批人生了病請不起醫生的，那才糟。醫生雖「存心濟世」，可是包車阿三，粗做娘姨，石庫門洋樓，都要化錢才得，有名的，更是身價有關。卽使「貧病减半」甚至什麽「紀念送診」，終究不能把藥方呑下肚去，醫生看了没藥吃，豈不更糟！是故，有人說窮漢壓根兒不該生病，不無小道理。</p>
<p>然而，開初已經說過，病是平等不過的，拾破布的和坐「馬托卡」的都有生病的資格和機會，不過，這延醫吃藥的問題，倒不是人人可以談得上的。所以，做人最好不窮，窮了最好不要生病，「窮人無病便是福」，「馬托卡」與我們由哉！</p>

<h3>冬至</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>是他最得意的那一年，東街的南貨店因爲老闆過世而關門了，五家鎭上兼售南貨的就只有他一家，一半是朋友們的慫恿，一半營業上確有擴充的必要。當他檢出歷年由銅元而銀毫積蓄起來的大龍洋。心頭一種不可遏止的喜悅彷彿蛇一般的　遍着全身。他們首貼了一張「修裝門面，照常交易」的字條，每天早晨，那個巨大的身體在店堂内搬出搬進，一方面應付那些主顧們「老闆，恭喜你呀！」的頌詞，又恐怕阻碍了木匠的工作。雖是深秋冬初的時節，大腦袋上却冒着水氣，那些頑皮的孩子們，在他門口拍着小手喊：「出籠饅頭，兩個銅板買一個。」他老是堆着笑臉每個孩子分他們一顆香蕉糖。</p>
<p>門面新裝好了，貨物也從航船上運來，爲了紀念老店新開，特地大廉價三天。没有到冬至門前每天堆满着人，大腦袋上的水氣自然冒着，可是「老闆，老闆，」他恨二個手掌不够分配。</p>
<p>這年，五家鎭上最早歇業的是德祥雜貨店，他盤點了錢財貨物，那個大肚子擺得更有樣：而且年三十夜酒樓上發見了他的足跡。</p>
<p>這鎭上雖是大家認識大胖子，酒店裏却没有做過他的生意，店夥計招呼着：「胖老闆，恭喜你發了財呀！」</p>
<p>「哈哈，大家發財，哈···」</p>
<p>搬動着他身體的時候，他向那些座客點頭。</p>
<p>年初五接財神，他店堂内特别熱閙。鄉間習慣，新正休業五天，過了今夜，明天做生意了，所以接財神是件比吃年夜飯更大的事。胖子嫌保險燈不够亮，租來一個汽油燈，附近的鄰居都來趕熱閙，他牢記着那夜過了三更才送走那些賓客的。</p>
<p>一個原來的笑臉展開的時候，他被喊聲驚醒了，店堂裏站着一個高齊櫃台的小孩：</p>
<p>「胖伯伯，兩個銅板白糖快點。」</p>
<p>「心急什麽！」他没有預料自己說出來的聲音這末高。</p>
<p>「弟弟哭了，姐姐喂他粥吃，他不要，買白糖去喂糖粥哩。」小孩子無邪地回答。</p>
<p>「你媽呢？」</p>
<p>「媽早上到上海找爸爸要錢。」</p>
<p>這幾句話使他满足了，他满肚子的寃屈似乎已向這封手訴說明白了，他給孩子兩倍價値的貨物，一邊連連揮手：</p>
<p>「快點回去。」</p>
<p>太陽已經正中了，店堂内的陽光都退到街心來，那條黑狗不知什麽時候又以階前睡熟了。他抬起大腦袋瞧着壁上的日歷，嚕咕起來：</p>
<p>「今天十八，明天，後天，大後天冬至了！」（完）</p>
<h3>女兒是别人家的人</h3>
<p>— （農村素描）</p>
<h3>蜘蛛</h3>
<p>— 蘆雁</p>
<p>只要是晴的時候，在屋角上就可以看得到蜘蛛的結網的，尤其是在夏天裏一陣暴風雨過後的時候。然而在都市裏，這樣富麗堂皇的高樓大厦，那樣的一塵不染的，眞是可謂白「壁」無暇，那裏還找得到蜘蛛的影子呢？可是在這裏，是要替自編羅網的，巧設陷阱而捕置小飛虫的蜘蛛，作深長的歎惜了！</p>
<p>縱使偶爾的來到次一等的樓屋裏，然只不過是曇花的一現，會被僕役們弄到於無何有之鄉。蜘蛛的運命，在都市的高樓裏，是很少有她底芳踪的。然而在一個這樣破舊的屋子裏，看上去它的命運，不久的被就要淘汰了，况且在這日日新的都市裏，「寸土黃金」的觀念下，難免要遭到漁利的人們底打算的。自然在這裏是爲了房租可以輕一點，而且是落伍的雰圍，摩登的都市人們，（除了另一種人而外）是看不入眼的，爲了這個緣故，自然是遭到人家的奚落，所以在這個破舊的屋子裏，不消說，地位好一點的，或者像暗處在牆角上，有一個光隙的，靠近住的，那裏自然是有一個蜘蛛的芳容，她羅起羅網，在那裏等待自投羅網的小飛虫們。可是小飛虫們的投羅網自然並不是有了别的歹意，而是爲了要走上出路，因爲光明的地方，是誰個都愛戴的，悶在暗黑的裏面，這都是任何東西所不願意的，除非是另一種的話。</p>
<p>在這種塲合裏頭，我偶然看到了一個蜘蛛，在小那屋的一個隙上垂了下來，同時在她自己的身上，放出隨風移蕩的游絲，看上去，她底目的是想緊住什麽，藉了空氣的帮助，她更加猖狂起來了。究竟空虚的周圍，是没有東西被她所綁，但，時空是動的，一秒鐘裏頭都有各種形態，雖然不能一下子被我們看見，然而她太驕傲了，在不注意之下，被急驟的風，吹下一片落葉，剛巧掉在她的網上，在一個這樣的破敗之下。自然是弄破了。在她毫不介意地又走上她的破了的網，把壞去了的殘網拾收了去，重新組織起她新的羅網，打旋地的勁奮的在做她的工作，不一會見，在這光明透進來的小隙上，又被她網起了新的羅網。在這裏是預備好了，小飛虫們的投羅的。</p>
<p>我不禁想到了她满腹的經綸。在一個很適當的地方，擺起她底羅網，會獲得她所需的勝利品，不錯，這是一種機會，她懂得了這種機會。小飛虫們根本是盲然，她利用一綫光明的隙，料得了小飛虫們，是要到光明的地方去，光的地方自然是大好的天空，可以自由翺翔，在這裏，她就得了個很好的機會。在這偶然的感觸之下，我懂的了這人生的一面，於是我又明白了投機的人們！</p>
<h3>殺雞</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>在過於寂寞的境域中，常會從淸澈的腦海裏浮出一種幻想來，卽使是一件不爲人們注意的平常事，往往會縈迴在精敏的思緖裏而得到了不平凡的悟性。我對於一切事物都要去細細觀察，從一個微小的螞蟻到一頭巨大的象，從一粒火星子到鍋爐口裏的烈熖，是用同樣的目光和思想的。近來，忽然有了一個乖戾的奇想，想看看殺人的慘劇，可是，同時，又不願意這機會很容易地被我獲得。雖然，我並不是個膽量小或唯心論者，我却總不忍見一個鮮跳活躍的生命在刹那間倒斃於他自己的熱血之流上面呵！</p>
<p>就說這次看殺雞吧，却亦用了到刑塲去似的勇氣哩。</p>
<p>這天早晨，天窗外面有着普朗的天空，兩條陽光打板壁縫裏擠進來舐着潔白的帳子，舐成兩圈精光。我是愛朝氣的，便起身下牀，正擬到鄰近公園裏去散走的時候，忽來了個不認識的同鄉，手裏携着兩隻雞，起初我很疑惑，後來知道是鄉間的一個親戚託他帶給我的，於是，我送了那同鄉出門後，便有了個問題横在眼前等待我去解决，那問題就在兩隻雞的身上，「在自己這並不寛暢的房間裏，多來了幾個朋友，就有互相踏痛凍瘡的危險了，怎樣還能養雞！而且，雞屎满地板的，在衛生和觀瞻兩方面，都有關碍。把彼倆怎樣處置呢？「靠在沙發上思索着，有一支烟的時候。</p>
<p>「把牠轉送給朋友吧，然而，我不願意把動物的生命作爲我對人表示好感的禮品，雖然，在現社會上往往運人的生命都會如禮品似的被互相贈送着的時候，我仍保持着這獨特的觀念，未免是太愚蠢了，可是，在我是一種主張，得維持下去的。我寗可自己把這兩隻雞殺，煮，吃，我不想利用他們去獻媚行贿似的巴結别人而希冀獲得一些額外的好處。」於是，掉第二支烟蒂兒的時候，有了解决問題的辦法：「還是自己殺了吃吧！」於是，殺雞的一幕展開了！</p>
<p>二房東的夥計是殺雞能手，願意代勞，他熟悉地先把那隻雌的頸根向翅膀裏一灣，我已有些寒心了，但，理智告訴自己：「根本是被人殺吃的生物」，但瞧着他拔去咽喉邊的羽毛，露出桃色的皮膚，雌雞的腿，爪，亦抖動起來，知道牠已感覺痛，我些不忍，懊悔不把　　送掉，但，理智又告訴自己：「牠生時亦啄食過蟲類的」，便又瞧着雪亮的刀鋒向挑色的皮膚裏戮下，鮮血直流的時候，我幾乎要躱避了。</p>
<p>那隻雄的亦在奔逃中被夥計，住，照樣灣頸根，拔毛，操刀，流血。</p>
<p>兩個鮮跳活躍的生命在刹那間被毁滅，從這乖戾的情形又使我想到了刑堪，從殺雞又使我假想到殺人。抬起腦袋來，却是晴朗的天空。</p>

<h3>不能進夜校奈何！</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我自十五歲那年的暑假期中，爲了環境所逼，就抛棄了書本，到本埠一家商店裏去當學徒。今年才满師。</p>
<p>現在我覺得我的學問很淺，想起自己將來的前途，眞是没有光明的希望。在每天晚上，眼看着人家挾着書本，到夜校去讀書，求高深的學問，我眞是非常的羨慕。所以我曾經屢次的要求我的先生。（卽老闆）給我晚上讀二小時的書。但我那先生是一個十足的保守着封建思想的人，非但不允許我的要求，並且還要停歇我的生意。我雖然受了數次的拒絶，然而想求學的心，仍是不减。</p>
<p>最近我曾想出很多的方法。但不能逹到讀夜書的目的。眞是使我難過極了！</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>先生你是我輩靑年的導師，請你告訴我一個怎樣可以使我的學問高深一些的方法吧！　此祝</p>
<p>撰安　胡敬上</p>
<p>編者按：具有極高的求知慾望，而不能得到满足，實在是天下最痛苦的事。可是一般舊式商店的店主却多不能了解求學的意義及其重要性，所以胡君爲了要上夜校，竟被他的店主絶拒了。我們認爲這種現象單在上海一處看起來，和胡君同樣的感到煩悶的靑年，已經是多得不可計數；内地更不必談了。</p>
<p>現在胡君應繼續努力，再請一位與店主有關而且頭腦淸新的人，代爲說項，言詞務宜婉轉動聽，以逹到求學的目的。</p>
<p>假使這一步計劃也難實現，我們勸胡君不必過於灰心。認爲求學無望。他可以一面極其秘密的託人另找較好的機會，設法脫去該店主的束縳，一方面應該想出别的方法，來满足求知的慾望。</p>
<p>關於求學的方法，我們認爲能入學校讀書，當然更好，但萬一爲環境所不許而没有這種機會的時候，不入學校也可以得到自己所需要的學識。像入日校或夜校讀書，不過是得到一點工具的知識吧了，要想求取高深的學識，一定還要靠自己的努力，非單在學校方面可以獲得。所以我們勸胡君不必失望，他應該下最大的决心，利用業餘的時間，實行自修的工作。每天稍有餘暇，就專心一志的從事研讀，這樣積年纍月的努力下去，則學問就在無形中增進了。</p>
<p>本報在大陸商塲三樓辦了一個流通圖書館，供給一般失學者所適合的書籍，不向讀者取任何費用。並又創設讀書指導部，儘最的替一般讀者解决關於書籍的疑問。胡君如有意自修，可加入該館。關於詳細情形及手續希逕函該館，詢問一切。</p>

<h3>美國建築之新趨向</h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>在世界大戰前，美國人賴著他們的財力和物質的進步，都迷於高大建築，互相競爭，互相誇耀。這在繁盛之城市如紐約，如芝加哥等，因爲地價之貴，人口之多，高大建築之所以勃興，自然也是環境造就的必然結果。美國一位著名的建築家曾說：「因了高大建築的制度，一個商人在紐約城中，一早晨可以做五倍的晤談接洽的事情，比之在倫敦或巴黎的話」。由此我們可以看到這一點商業上的便利，在今日經濟發逹之社會中，占着何等重要的地位。</p>
<p>地價之昂，人口之衆，也不就是高大建築興起的唯一原因。我們可以說美國人的好奇心和虚榮心是成功的一種原動力，同時在美國工程的發逹，材料的多而且廉，也都是其中極大的元素。像從前美國人雖賴着電氣升降機的便利能够造五百尺高的建築，但是假使没有工程家來發明同時用兩個升降機在同一的軸上的話，那麽一千尺高的建築至少在升降的交通上要發生困難了。</p>
<p>「舊世界」的建築，那些高於五六層的，都不過是從前建築的一種伸展罷了。在紐約第五條街上的高大建築，有十二層樓，當時認爲鉅工。但是我們看它的　板還是古時的式樣，是預先雕刻好了裝上去的，其用處旣不足以蔽護牆壁的一小部份，而觀瞻起來與全部建築相比稱更覺得其大小不諧，令人發噱。</p>
<p>後來建築漸漸地增高，這種意大利皇宮式的建築方法也就被人擯棄，而鋼骨之使用於是乎大興。紐約城中著名的華而華司建築是美國人舉爲誇耀的大工程，其鋼骨之直綫外形十分雄壯。但是這還不過是一點比前進步的地方，美國的建築師究竟不能不用一個尖頂，敎堂式的屋頂，壁龕，副　，以及哥西克式的附飾物之類，這除了給人們以宗敎式的影像以外，簡直没有絲毫意義。其後又有别的高的建築樹立起來，它們雖然不是全體帶着古代的遺式，却仍免不了要在底層和屋頂保留些古代的痕跡。</p>
<p>在這時候美國人對於高大建築感覺興趣十分濃厚，同時市政和居民衛生也就受了很多的影響。所以紐約就有一種新法律名之曰「地帶法律」（ＺoningＬaw）。這種法律不僅限制了房屋的高度，並且還限制了建築的式樣。大略的講起來，此律規定凡建築者祇許在他的全部地叚的一部份上建立任何高度的房屋，其他臨街的部份其高度不得過於街闊之幾倍，比例應依各地而定。這就是說有些地方臨街屋高不得過二百尺的高度，有些地方不得過二百五十尺，過此則房屋應向裏漸次斜進，使日光和空氣能暢逹於建築之底部。於是這時就有許多大建築如紐約電話公司的建築，雪兒登建築等依次樹立，都受這法律的規定。這些建築的窗户的設計頗與尋常不同，較小而密列，遠望如點斑一般。並且全部建築不作一些古式的裝飾，使美國之建築至此而别成一派。</p>
<p>這是美國建築的新趨勢。建築家都注意於工程之設計，室内配光之工作，以及屋週街道上之光綫空氣計劃等。有人說現在的建築家好比是一位雕刻家，他可以完成任何式樣的房屋。這句話似乎很不差，因爲我們現在有了鋼骨混凝土的建造方法，有了世界上從來没有的堅固而輕的材料，更有了工程上無數的新設備，建築的形式怎樣，簡直對於建造上没有址分的困難。所以今日的建築家往往在設計的時候，先做一個泥的或蠟的模型，任意配置，以求他理想中的稱配。這和雕刻的藝術又有何差别。</p>
<p>因了高大建築之受法律所限制，所以愈高的建築，其底部所占地面亦愈大，而每一建築的獨立性亦愈顯明。當城市中充满了高大的建築之後，我們就不再見有連接的房屋並立着了。建築的形狀也新奇不同，有的可以稱是鋼鐵和玻璃的建築，有的是包裏在耀光的金屬鑲板之中，也有的是全體烏黑，也有的是凝白如雪，這其間就没有一些共同性的變化。古代希臘，羅馬，高西克式等建築都脫不了許多共有的特點，建築家的努力似乎有限制，但是現在的建築却不是這樣了，人們的心思也可以放逸無拘，各求藝術上可能的進展。此新趨向就使美國之建築在世界上成爲極有希望的新發展，含自由獨立之精神於建築之中。</p>
<h3>談談摩天樓</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>（一）何謂摩天樓</p>
<p>所謂摩天變Ｓkyscraper者。卽摩天之樓。其巔之高。望之若摩天擦頂。摩天云者。乃形容其高入雲間。蒼天無頂。焉得摩天。故樓之高。非眞能摩天也。最近上海都市之中。二十二層之摩天樓已告落成。一時國際飯店。四行儲蓄會之名。遍傳人口。里巷街頭。莫不以摩天樓爲談助。實有婦孺皆知之槪。此亞東最高之二十二層摩天樓。確可雄示東半球。實則二十二層之摩天樓。在東亞固獨霸一方。而在歐美各國。則尙爲短屋低房也。不聞英之倫敦。美之紐約。摩天之樓。有高至五六十層者乎。然則二十二層之摩天樓。又焉足引爲尤物耶。第在遠東尙爲始祖。故得遠近傳聞耳。</p>
<p>（二）爲何要建摩天樓</p>
<p>或曰樓兩三層乃至五六層足矣。奚必二三十層耶。不知都市之中。人口日多。地價日貴。熱閙之處。房屋櫛比。大有人满之禍。於是一般地主。除加高房屋之層次以應居民所需外。别無他法補救矣。房屋之加高。於地主實有大利。在建築物中。高層房屋。所謂摩天之樓。爲最經濟之建築也。建屋一層。與建屋二三十層者。其地價之價値。固完全相同。此其一。房屋一高。闢室必多。於租賃於人。所收房租。必較一層爲多。此其二。建築之時。平均建築層可比低屋便宜不少。此其三。此外經濟之處更。恕不盡述於此。明乎此。摩天樓之建築。亦可知其大槪矣。</p>
<p>（三）摩天樓之應用</p>
<p>摩天樓之建築。一方爲地主之經濟。將地産之値價。充分利用。一方可供社會斯需。以免人满無屋之患。而摩天樓之用途。則或闢特殊商塲。或供居民住宿。惟此中亦有特殊之缺點。開設商店。顧客購物。上下之時。每感不便。而供人居住。亦有同樣之苦感。故除非須要。摩天樓亦未必適應一般需要。以上海言。人口雖已逾三百萬。然空地尙多。且大多數房屋。皆爲二三層。故卽或人满。將住宅加至三四層已足。觀乎近頃所築房屋。大半已爲三四層。卽因此也。惟以居民之習慣。卽三四層樓。亦嫌不便。何况十層以上。雖有電梯。亦必不歡。摩天樓之不適供滬人住宅。卽此可見。然用以供特殊商業之應用。則未始不可也。</p>
<p>（四）摩天樓之屋基</p>
<p>當建築摩天樓之時。我人須最先注意者。卽基地之軟硬如何。其力量究能負重若干。脫力不能勝。則房屋一高。基地必會陷落。美之紐約。地下皆爲石質。故摩天之樓。雖高至五六十層。亦不致陷下。至於上海。地質不同。臨近海岸。泥土疏鬆。是故摩天樓之建築。在十層以上者。基礎已須特别堅固。否則不能負此重量矣。此所以工程師在建築摩天樓之前。對於屋基之如何而可特别堅固。能負多層之樓屋。必視爲先决問題也。屋基固矣。然後再進行建築工作。</p>
<p>（五）摩天樓之建築</p>
<p>建築一摩天之樓也。除屋基須特别注意而外。建屋之時。應注意之點尙多。如建築材料。爲使房屋之耐久及力能負重計。一切原料。均須採用上等。樓高而後。下層房屋。光綫每多不足。然建築得法。則亦可使其到處光足。他如房屋旣高。所隔居室必多。而容人亦多。是以倘不愼而發生火警。撲救不易。尤以高層爲最。萬一不幸而火燬。而損失之大。甚於普通房屋。故防火設備。務必周密。爲使居者上下便利迅速。不嫌遲慢起見。電梯更應多設。此外高層之屋。風雨擊撞较烈。窗户玻璃。須用不碎者。以及多劃通路。使進出便所等等。問題之多。不勝枚舉。爲篇幅所限。恕不能盡述也。</p>
<h3>建築行話</h3>
<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>丨丨關於築塲裏用丨丨</p>
<p>建築房屋，在搆造的立塲上，不論是做法或者用料，有些地方的名稱是外間所不容易聽見的，好像這是專門用於築塲裏的」種「切口」。現在將普通常講在嘴裏應該用着的，寫點出來：</p>
<p>望平水丨丨用測量器（Ｔransit）在不平衡的塲地上，打了小椿。（呌平水椿）劃出高低的標記，使房屋在建造時不至有傾斜的患害。</p>
<p>汰石灰綫丨丨初步手續，將圖樣上的房屋式樣，普通如天井，客堂，廚房之類的尺寸，開闊，在監工者的愼密的考慮之下，一根一根用麻綫拉出，然後彈以石灰屑，（石灰末子）使之顯露在建造房屋的塲地上。</p>
<p>排漿丨丨什麽呌排漿，這在於普通建造街房或弄堂樓房，在開挖墻溝（Ｔrench）後下三和土（ＬimeＣoncrete）時用着它的，因爲三和土是普通建造上的基礎手續，必須用重量的石錘排成堅牢的固體，排漿在那時澆下去，猶之調和些膠質在三和土裏面，它的成分是一分石灰，二分黑沙。</p>
<p>回馬槍丨丨排三和土時來而復往的連排二次，第二次就呌回馬槍，這是大都用於江北帮小工的。</p>
<p>打腰箍丨丨排三和土再後一次手續，在三和土面洒以黃沙，更用石錘排堅，這意思就是打腰箍。</p>
<p>擺脚丨丨擺脚是泥水匠方面的工作，普通如樓房等在砌五寸或十寸墻時，在三和土面擺的大方脚。（Ｆooting）係逐皮收起，大槪廿寸，廿五寸，三十寸不等。</p>
<p>扚綫丨丨這也是泥水匠的工作，在砌墻逢三五皮，用麻綫緊拉成一條直綫，然後依直綫的一塊塊砌上，這是抵禦磚塊的厚薄和豫防墻身的傾圯的方法。</p>
<p>殺灰丨丨泥水匠手術不高妙的在砌墻時往往使磚塊不在直綫上，這原因是受了没有扚綫的癖病。救濟方法，將高出的地方，使灰沙刮薄，這呌殺灰，反之，低下的地方，使灰沙加厚，這呌炎灰。</p>
<p>满斗丨丨（Ｆlush）又名刮斗，在每皮磚塊上，用灰沙塗满。</p>
<p>勒縫丨丨就是將灰縫（Pointing）勒淸爽。</p>
<p>八分找丨丨磚塊缺少了十分之二的，名之八分找。</p>
<p>老孵鷄丨丨並非動物中的老孵鷄，而是打椿架用的鐵鎚上的開關，形狀很像老孵鷄的模樣。</p>
<p>收縮丨丨（Ｓhrink）木料受混易縮，遇熱則漲，收縮的意思，就是如此。</p>
<p>虚綫丨丨（Ｄotted　Ｌine）是圖樣上並不用於建造房屋上的墨綫條，而繪在圖樣上的一根根，這呌虚綫。</p>
<p>馬凳丨丨馬凳（Ｔrestil）用於搗水門汀（Ｃement）時使尺寸的厚薄劃出和擱脚手（Ｓcaffolding）用。</p>
<p>摔頭丨丨墻身和墻身有連接之處，鑲有犬牙齒似的磚塊，就呌摔頭，（Ｂond）它有雌（Groove）雄(Toothing)之别。</p>
<p>花槽丨丨墻身的闊度，如磚塊難以配合，則其中間可以留些空隙，這空隙就是花槽（Ｒebate）。　（待續）</p>

<h3>Hunan Army Pursues Bandits into Guizhou Province</h3>
<p>Channel City Completely Recovered</p>
<p>Guizhou Army Also Reports Attack on Liping</p>
<p>Guangxi Army Cooperates to Block Bandits in Heavy Siege</p>
<p>(Changsha) Bandits fleeing from passage through Xiangxi, Jing County, and Sui Ning have been fiercely suppressed by Liu Jianxu leading his troops for days. Chen Guangzhong's division, in the area of Daoshui boundary between Tong and Jing, killed several hundred bandits, seized over 300 guns. Zhang Liangji, Tao Guang, and other divisions killed over 1,000 bandits near Channel City, captured over 300 guns, and took 600 to 700 bandits as prisoners. Channel City was completely recovered on the 15th. The remaining bandits fled into the old Jinping and Jianhe areas on the Guizhou border. The Hunan army pursued them into Guizhou territory, surrounding and attacking. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>

During this time of national crisis, the committee members all offered their opinions and contributed to discussions on how to strengthen national power and rescue the country from danger. This phenomenon is particularly gratifying. The most important goal of the session's discussions was the draft constitution. The draft constitution has been the result of the Legislative Yuan's efforts for a year and a half, adopting the strengths of various national constitutions and consulting public opinion. It also underwent expert research before its completion. Therefore, the plenary session discussed it with extreme caution, first submitting it to a review committee and then discussing it in two general sessions. Finally, it was decided to submit it to the Central Executive Committee for careful deliberation. The session also paid close attention to the people's livelihood, especially the salt administration reform plan, and passed the organization of a salt administration reform committee. In addition, issues related to education, such as reducing holidays and shortening the school year, were also considered extremely important. In summary, although the session was short, the resolutions made were of extreme importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3>Key Points of Amendment to Draft Civil Procedure Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) There are 40 key points of the amendment to the Civil Procedure Law, the most important being: (1) The system of declaring provisional execution is necessary in our country, but the scope of provisional execution stipulated in the current law is too narrow to provide adequate protection. Therefore, the amendment expands it. (2) For appeals to the Third Instance Court regarding lawsuits over property rights, the current law requires that the benefits gained from the appeal exceed 300 yuan. The amendment revises the appeal benefit amount to 500 yuan, in order to prevent abuse of appeals. It also stipulates that the highest judicial administrative organ may, according to the local economic situation, reduce it to 300 yuan or increase it to 1,000 yuan by order, in order to be fair. (3) There should be considerable connection between civil mediation and litigation procedures. Therefore, the amendment modifies and incorporates various articles of the Civil Mediation Law and its implementation rules into this law. (4) If an appeal does not comply with the required formalities but can be rectified, the amendment instructs the court of original jurisdiction to order its rectification within a specified period. If the order is not followed, the appellate court may directly dismiss it. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Collecting Materials on Qinhuangdao Customs Officer Shooting Incident</h3>

A Kien-toth, the Customs Commissioner of the Qinhuangdao Customs, telegraphed Yiwo, the chief of the Japanese special service agency in Yushu, requesting the detention of the ship, but was unsuccessful. A special telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance and the General Customs Administration and the Political Reorganization Committee requesting a strong protest be lodged with the Japanese Embassy. The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a few days ago to take action. Due to the past situation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs only saw reports in the newspapers and was not very familiar with the details. Yesterday, it telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting that all materials related to the case be compiled and sent to the ministry so that it can be thoroughly understood and have sufficient basis when drafting the protest.

<h3>Han Traitors in Tangshan and Luanzhou are Smuggling Silver Outward</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance issued an order to all customs offices in the country to strictly prohibit the export of silver, the customs offices along the Great Wall have implemented the order. However, due to the strong influence of a certain country in the local areas of each port, especially at Yuguan, and the previous incident of a certain foreigner shooting our customs officers in Qinhuangdao, in the past ten days, there have been incidents of Han traitors in Tangshan, Luanzhou, and other places smuggling large quantities of silver out of the country through Yuguan. Our customs office at Yuguan is very close to the puppet customs office, and there are too many disputes between them. The people involved feel particularly troubled. Recently, the puppet customs office at Yuguan also received a puppet order to formulate a so-called method of exempting customs duties on the import of silver, which is actually sheltering the smuggling of silver out of the customs from Tangshan and other places.

<h3>The Hebei Provincial Government's Move to Baoding is Still Difficult to Realize for the Time Being</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Houwan, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Hebei Province, said that the recent survey of the Longyuan disaster refugees showed that there were still more than 140,000 people, more than 100,000 in Dongming, and more than 20,000 in Puyang, all of whom had no homes to return to. With the arrival of the severe winter, the situation is extremely pitiful. The issue of the provincial government moving to Baoding is difficult because the provincial treasury is stretched thin and the relocation and renovation of houses require funds everywhere. Moreover, during the relocation, the various departments will inevitably temporarily stop working, creating many difficulties. Joint office work is being carefully studied. The consolidation of bureaus and departments in each county will be implemented on January 1st next year. The organization of militia in the counties of Hebei Province is complex.

<p>(Tianjin) At 1:00 AM on the morning of the 17th, dense fog enveloped the city of Tianjin.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Compiles Budget for the 24th Year</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Accounting Department of the Ministry of Finance, they are now starting to prepare the budget for the 24th year. According to the budget for the 23rd year, the difference between income and expenditure already exceeded 50 million yuan in terms of expenditure. In addition, the tax revenue situation for July, August, and September of this year was even more sharply reduced. Compared with the same months in the 22nd year, customs duties were down by 15 million yuan, salt taxes were down by 9 million yuan, and consolidated taxes were down by 3 million yuan. Based on this calculation, the total difference for the entire 23rd year will exceed 100 million yuan. The budget for the 23rd year still had income from public bonds. Therefore, the national treasury income for the 24th year will naturally be even lower than the income for the 23rd year. In terms of expenditure, the 24th year will still increase due to the increase in principal and interest payments on public bonds. Therefore, the estimated revenue for the 24th year must first be reduced in expenditure, and efforts must be made to tighten spending in order to match revenue and expenditure.

<p>(Peiping) British Minister Sir Alexander Cadogan arrived in Peiping this morning, accompanied by Counselor Teichman, Lady Cadogan, and their son. Cadogan said that he had inspected overseas Chinese affairs in various parts of South China and had very good impressions. According to a member of the British Legation, the British government already had the intention of moving the legation south, but the legation had not yet received formal orders. However, preparations for the move south are underway. After a short rest in Peiping, the minister will visit the military and political authorities of Peiping. (17th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>American Missionary Murder Case, Young Daughter Rescued to Safety</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The American missionaries Mr. Stann and another were murdered by bandits in Jingde, southern Anhui, some time ago. Our government deeply regrets and attaches great importance to this matter. After receiving the report, we immediately sent telegrams to the military and local authorities to find ways to rescue them. Upon hearing that Stann and others had been killed, we telegraphed the local authorities again to do their best to rescue them. The young daughter of the missionaries has now been rescued. It is difficult to predict the actions of brutal bandits. The American Legation is quite understanding of this. It is now known that our diplomatic authorities have sent Yang Guang-sheng, a special commissioner for diplomatic inspection of the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Anhui, and Jiangxi, to Anhui to investigate the details. Meanwhile, the local military and political authorities are strictly arresting the murderers and punishing them according to the law. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Stamp Tax Increased by 20% to Subsidize Remote Provinces</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The second Financial Conference resolved that 40% of the stamp tax revenue should be allocated to local governments and 80% to the central government. The central government would then take 20% to subsidize remote and impoverished provinces. In the past, the central government only actually collected from ten provinces. The remaining thirteen provinces all earmarked their contributions for various uses. Although the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Chahar nominally submitted their revenue to the central government, it was actually allocated for military expenses. Part of the revenue from the other seven provinces was also allocated for military expenses. Now that 40% has been allocated to local governments, the local governments and the stationed troops will resolve the portion that was previously allocated for military expenses themselves. The 20% allocation to subsidize remote provinces has already been made. Gansu receives 20,000 yuan per month, Ningxia receives 15,000 yuan per month, and Qinghai, Suiyuan, and Chahar each receive 10,000 yuan per month. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Shortfall in Stamp Tax, Measures Being Planned to Remedy the Situation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the stamp tax stamps were changed to be sold through the post office, the revenue reduction is estimated to be about 25%. The Tax Administration believes that this is a natural trend and there is no need to change the original plan. As for remedial measures, it telegraphed all provincial and municipal governments on the 17th, asking them to fully assist with political power to increase tax revenue. In addition, the Shanxi Department of Finance telegraphed that the province's actual collection in the past was 45,000 yuan per month, but the actual collection last month was only 40,000 yuan, a reduction of 5,000 yuan, and asked for instructions. The Ministry of Finance telegraphed Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Taiyuan, and Xu Shuichang, the chairman of the provincial government, yesterday, asking them to issue a general order to the entire province to assist in sales with political power. In addition, the registration of old stamps by chambers of commerce in various places has begun, and new stamps can be exchanged starting in January next year. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Formulates Principles for Levying Transaction Tax</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has drafted two items for the levy of a transaction tax, draft regulations and principles, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review. The principles are (1) the transaction tax is based on transactions in the stock exchange, and the taxpayers are both buyers and sellers; (2) the transaction tax is based on the types of existing transactions in the exchange, with reference to the transaction market conditions, and is specified separately in order to suit social, economic, and financial conditions. The tax rate for marketable securities is calculated based on the agreed price of the transaction, and the tax rate for other items is calculated based on the unit of transaction.

<h3>Strange Man Seeks to Meet President of Executive Yuan in Front of Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Appears to be Mentally Ill</p>
<p>Guards Hand Him Over to Police</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9 a.m. on the 17th, a man about fifty years old, wearing a patched cotton jacket and pants, a silk coat, and straw sandals, with bloodstains on his face, rushed into the Executive Yuan. The guards refused to let him in because of his strange attire. The man shouted that he wanted to see the president. The guards thought he was mentally ill and firmly blocked him from entering. The man had a tough attitude and insisted on entering, saying, "I have important national affairs to discuss, why are you blocking me?" After a long argument, he was tied up with rope, but he kept shouting. He was then taken away by the police. (17th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Expectations for the National Cooperative Enterprise Discussion Conference</h3>
<p>Ting</p>
<p>On April 17 of this year, the Jiangbei Cooperative Enterprise Discussion Conference was held in Zhenjiang, which was quite a grand event. Recently, the National Economic Council, the Rural Reconstruction Committee, and the Ministry of Industry have scheduled a National Cooperative Enterprise Discussion Conference to be held from January 23rd to 27th of next year to promote and guide cooperative enterprises. This is indeed very gratifying news. We dare to raise a few points to call everyone's attention.</p>
<p>First, according to a survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, credit cooperatives are the most developed among the national cooperatives, accounting for 46.2% of the total. However, according to a survey by our newspaper's yearbook, the number of national credit cooperatives in the 22nd year of the Republic of China was 5,720, with a total share capital of only 327,880 yuan. In such a large country, the share capital of credit cooperatives is so small that it is a drop in the bucket. The first to be able to enrich credit cooperatives should be the bankers in major cities. Major banks in our city (such as the Bank of China, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and Jin Cheng Bank) have already shifted their focus to rural investment, and the investment targets are focused on rural credit cooperatives. This point is most relevant to the development of cooperative enterprises and is indeed gratifying. However, the current investment of the banking industry in the interior is only several million yuan, which is still too little and urgently needs to be expanded. In early July, the National Government announced the Savings Bank Law, Article 8 of which stipulates that the savings bank's pledge loans and product-secured loans to rural cooperatives shall not be less than one-fifth of the total deposits. We believe that if this article can be fully implemented, the rural economy can be greatly assisted. Each bank should immediately organize a cooperative banking group for rural lending and set a comprehensive plan for each province to avoid the drawbacks of mutual competition. Fortunately, the financial authorities, in order to ensure the safety of the banking industry's investment, have consulted with the provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, Guangdong, Shandong, Henan, etc., and instructed their subordinates to supervise the rural areas to organize sound cooperatives. Banks can refuse to invest in unsound cooperatives. Among the representatives attending the National Cooperative Enterprise Discussion Conference will be the heads of provincial and municipal governments and banks investing in cooperative enterprises. We hope that they can discuss a proper method to help the rural areas.</p>
<p>Second, the number of existing cooperatives in the country is most developed in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong. The reason is that the provincial governments of these provinces are directly responsible for guiding and promoting them. We hope that a concrete plan can be formulated at the national discussion conference to require the remaining provincial and municipal governments to implement the promotion of cooperative enterprises in the same way. Do not let a small number of banks or charities, such as the China International Famine Relief Commission, do it alone.</p>
<p>Third, it is still impossible to achieve results if there is no basic talent to organize national cooperatives. Therefore, Xue Xianzhou had already proposed the establishment of a cooperative training institute, hoping to train cooperative talents who can truly sacrifice and work hard. In recent years, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Zhejiang provinces have held cooperative training classes. After the students have completed their studies, they are appointed as instructors and sent to various counties to directly guide farmers to organize cooperatives. In addition, the Bandit Suppression Headquarters also specially set up a cooperative instructor training center in Hankou, recruiting 400 graduates from secondary schools and above in the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, training them to become talents, and sending them to various places for guidance. This training work urgently needs to be centralized and expanded. Originally, with good instructors, it is possible to maintain the faith of ordinary members in the value and purpose of cooperation, and it is also possible to avoid factions within the community and prevent anything from happening outside the scope of cooperation.</p>
<p>Fourth, after each cooperative is established, it should be united with other cooperatives into a large group in order to achieve the goal of national and world cooperative alliances. However, organizations such as the Cooperative Association in our country are extremely lacking. It can simply be said that there are none. After the cooperatives are established, they do not know how to unite with each other to seek self-protection and improvement. Their fate will inevitably tend to failure or become profit-making enterprises outside the scope of the cooperative movement. The remedy for this point should also be carefully considered at the next National Discussion Conference. Then, China's cooperative enterprise can be worthy of its name and prosper.</p>
<h3>A Strong and Powerful China is an Important Factor for World Peace</h3>
<p>Envoy Guo Delivers Speech in London</p>
<p>Hopes that Britain Can Better Understand China</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty Should be Maintained with Cooperation</p>
<p>(London) The China Association held a banquet tonight. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Minister to the United Kingdom, spoke at the banquet in response to the address by the chairman of the association, Sir MacDonald. He said that if the association encourages the British public to better understand China and the construction projects that China has achieved, it can greatly enhance the relationship between China and Britain. A strong and powerful China is a major factor for world peace. The Chinese market contains the most abundant potential for world trade. Although there are still outstanding payments for contracts signed between China and foreign countries, China's performance in repaying foreign debts is better than that of any other country. Sir Alexander Cadogan, the British Minister to China, has spared no effort in his activities and has gained a good understanding of China, which has won him the favor of the Chinese people. Guo then said that the Chinese finance, justice, transportation, and aviation inspection groups have come to the United Kingdom one after another this year to conduct inspections, which have consolidated the chain of traditional friendship between China and Britain. The full development of China depends on the tranquility and stability of the Far East political situation. If British and American politicians can cooperate to maintain the important principles crystallized in the Nine-Power Treaty as they did in Washington in 1922, a strong China will be beneficial to Britain and also benefit the whole world, etc. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>United States Considers Abandoning Freedom of the Seas Policy</h3>
<p>President Plans to Request Authorization from Congress</p>
<p>To Decide on the Course to Take in Wartime</p>
<p>Anglo-American Cooperation Eliminates a Major Obstacle</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States' policy on freedom of the seas may soon change. Reuters learned today that the State Department will submit a carefully considered plan to President Roosevelt, advocating a modification of the inherent policy. This is related to the United States' right to maintain freedom of the seas as a neutral country in wartime. It is expected that the government will ask Congress to grant the President the power to act expediently in order to decide the course the United States should take in the event of war in other countries. It is heard that some parties agree that the United States will not protect any American ships that dare to enter the war zone during wartime. The purpose of this proposition is to avoid conflict. What the State Department is currently considering will of course receive President Roosevelt's approval. It is heard that this matter has nothing to do with the London naval talks. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The British press is extremely interested in the possibility that the United States may abandon the principle of freedom of the seas, which it has always insisted on. The Daily Telegraph reported that "Freedom of the seas is a principle that the United States has always advocated, and the Allied navies often found it difficult to operate during the European War because this principle was an obstacle. Now that the United States has abandoned it, it is implementing a policy that aims to reduce excessive profits for merchants in wartime and to prevent war. Although it is not known whether the prevention of war will succeed, there is a benefit to abolishing the right of passage enjoyed by neutral countries in war zones, that is, if a war occurs, its duration can be shortened because the enemy country can strictly blockade it." The New Chronicle said, "President Roosevelt's decision is very important. This is tantamount to officially recognizing that there is no other way to guarantee world peace except for the collective security system. We can regard this as a movement for the United States to approach the League of Nations. What is even more important is that the principle of freedom of the seas has been the biggest obstacle to cooperation between Britain and the United States in the past. Now that the United States has abandoned this principle, it will not be difficult for Britain and the United States to cooperate closely, and Tokyo will inevitably pay attention to this."

<h3>Hearst Newspapers Comment on the Status of the Philippines</h3>
<p>Recognizes that Japan Will Ultimately Be a Hidden Danger to the United States</p>
<p>Granting Independence to the Philippines is Tantamount to Voluntarily Abandoning It</p>
<p>Strongly Criticizes the Short-Sightedness of Congressmen</p>
<p>(New York) The Hearst newspapers uniformly published a commentary signed by Hearst on the front page this morning, strongly criticizing Congress for passing the Philippine Independence Act. Hearst believes that the case is tantamount to abandoning the Philippine Islands to Japan. The article states that Japan's threat to the United States is undeniable. It is easy for Japan to occupy and manage the Philippine Islands. Once the time is right, it will annex the Philippine Islands and make them a part of the Japanese Empire. At this time, Japan's manpower and naval power will inevitably increase greatly. At this time, the Japanese can do whatever they want. Can Congress turn a blind eye to Japan's conspiracy to occupy the Philippine Islands, Guam, and trust territories and develop towards California? Japan is sure that Britain will do nothing but make empty protests. The article rebukes the cowardly congressmen, saying that they only know how to seek benefits for their constituencies. In their eyes, the few acres of farmland owned by one person in their constituency are more important than all the resources, commerce, and military value of the Philippine Islands. Hearst further stated that in 1935, whether traveling by American plane or Japanese plane from the Philippine Islands to California, it only takes twenty-four hours. And the day of abandoning the Philippine Islands is the day of the decline of the United States. Only corrupt countries shrink back, and only hardworking countries expand. Japan is now expanding, and thinking of this, I feel cold. (16th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Naval Talks Decide to Postpone Meeting on the Eve of Japan's Declaration of Treaty Abolition</h3>
<p>The Three Countries Will Hold One Last Meeting</p>
<p>Whether to Continue or Not Depends on Japan's Attitude</p>
<p>US Representatives Prepare to Return Home at the End of the Month</p>
<p>(London) The naval talks between Britain, the United States, and Japan will probably be postponed until Thursday. It is expected that Japan will announce the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty on Friday or Saturday. The US representatives have scheduled to depart for home on the 29th of this month. The date for the continuation of the discussion has not been mentioned yet. This will depend on the outcome of the British and Japanese representatives' negotiations on the British proposal. The main point of the British plan is that all three parties announce their shipbuilding programs. If the negotiations between the British and Japanese representatives are expected to succeed, then they may continue to discuss with the US representatives. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) As far as the impressions gained by Davis, the chief representative of the United States in the naval talks, are concerned, the US delegation is unwilling to offer any promises or accept any restrictions if the naval talks are held again under the current circumstances. As for the mutual notification of naval shipbuilding programs by all countries, the US delegation admits that it is not qualified to discuss it and that it should be considered through diplomatic channels. The US delegation has now prepared everything so that it can depart from Southampton on the 29th of December and return home on the George Washington. Before the departure of the US delegation, the representatives of Britain, the United States, and Japan will hold a plenary meeting once. The meeting time should be before Japan announces the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, probably on the 20th of this month. On that day, it will be officially announced that the naval talks will be postponed and a communique will be issued. (17th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Sends Sato to Britain</h3>
<p>To Strengthen the Lineup of the Delegation</p>
<p>Contents of the Anglo-Japanese Compromise Proposal</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Minister Hirota decided to send Sato Naotake, the ambassador to France, to London in the middle of this week to assist Ambassador Matsudaira, who also serves as the plenipotentiary for disarmament, because he is too busy day and night. He will continue to stay in London after the resumption of the talks to assist Matsudaira and Yamamoto, the two plenipotentiaries, to strengthen the lineup of the delegation and strive for the thorough implementation of Japan's new disarmament policy. When the formal meeting is held, he will of course attend as the plenipotentiary for foreign affairs. (17th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the situation of the Anglo-Japanese compromise trial proposal, according to information from various sources, the general content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Each government must gradually reduce its shipbuilding plan over a period of five years. The content of the declaration is to clarify the details of the shipbuilding plan for each type of ship in terms of both quality and quantity, as well as the construction of replacement ships and the delay of replacement ships, etc., but it is completely autonomous and does not add any international constraints, and no trace of the ratio system may be left. (2) Based on the distinction between offensive force and defensive weapons, it is believed that the former has equality in the classification of ships, while the latter is based on the principle of total tonnage and considers the special circumstances of each country's defense. (A) Regarding battleships, aircraft carriers, and Class A cruisers, although the equality of the classification of ships can be confirmed, the naval power of Britain and Japan differs in reality, and it is necessary to wait for them to reach equilibrium. In fact, it takes a considerable number of years. Therefore, considering the above facts, the Japanese government should independently announce the shipbuilding stage in the next few years, such as five or ten years. (B) For defensive weapons below Class B cruisers, it is possible to recognize the necessary force based on the principle of total tonnage and according to the special characteristics of national defense. For example, the British government has a total of seventy Class A and Class B cruisers, including fifteen existing Class A cruisers and ten Class B large cruisers. It is necessary to maintain and recognize its forty-five ships below 7,000 tons. It is also necessary to recognize Japan's maintenance of its existing submarine force of 78,000 tons. Therefore, according to the London Treaty, the Japanese government has an obligation to reduce submarines to 53,700 tons by the end of 1936, while the compromise trial proposal recognizes the maintenance of the above tonnage and its replacement ships. (3) Regarding the proposal to set a maximum limit for the shipbuilding plan, the British government does not want to oppose it deliberately. Generally, it reduces the quality of offensive weapons by 30%, battleships to 25,000 tons, aircraft carriers to 20,000 tons, and cruisers to 7,000 tons. The tonnage obtained from the reduction in quality can be used for cruisers. Furthermore, the number of digits to reduce the existing force by a few points is determined by the maximum limit. The establishment of a common maximum limit means that France and Italy must also recognize their equality. Therefore, the British government intends to try to change the concept of a common maximum limit, and its declaration is completely free from the shackles of the ratio system. This is the latent hard work in the compromise trial proposal. Although the US representative has not yet expressed approval of the above compromise trial proposal, if the British and Japanese representatives formulate a concrete plan, then the US delegation will not be able to isolate itself from the outside world. Therefore, the British government authorities are still expecting that the US delegation will definitely participate in the compromise trial proposal. Thus, this compromise trial proposal has become the one that dominates the future trend of preparatory consultations. (17th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Tokyo's Attitude is Cautious</h3>
<p>Instructions to be Sent Out Today</p>
<p>Intention to Abolish the Naval Treaty is Determined</p>

<p>visited Prime Minister Okada at his official residence to report on the situation of the London talks. Afterwards, the following plan was decided as a reply to the request for instructions from the two representatives Matsudaira and Yamamoto on the 13th, which will be sent out on the morning of the 18th. The content of the reply is as follows: (1) The Imperial Government has already put forward a new disarmament proposal and is working hard to conclude a new agreement, so it requests to continue the talks. (2) There is no objection to suspending the talks during Christmas, the end of the year, and the New Year, but it agrees to adjourn the meeting on the condition that the talks continue at an appropriate time next year. (3) During the adjournment, the British and American countries are requested to fully study and accept the Japanese proposal. (4) If the basic principles are recognized, it is prepared to submit specific figures. (17th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After meeting with Prime Minister Okada, Admiral Osumi said that the talks with the Prime Minister did not involve the issue of abolishing the Washington Treaty. Japan's policy has not changed in any way with regard to the established policy. If it is passed at the Privy Council plenary meeting on the 19th, it will proceed accordingly, and there is no obstacle to this. (17th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has roughly decided to announce the abolition of the treaty on the 22nd. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to issue a statement, the content of which is roughly as follows: (1) The abolition of the treaty is Japan's right, and because it is not suitable for the current situation, the abolition of the treaty is beyond doubt. (2) Japan hopes to conclude a new agreement again, so the abolition of the treaty does not violate the spirit of disarmament. (3) Announcing the abolition of the treaty will not hinder the initial London talks. (17th China United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Naval Preliminary Negotiations Show Discord Among Three Nations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo)  The outcome of the London Naval Conference negotiations is truly worth contemplating. It is said that the British side, before the Washington Treaty's abrogation notice, wants to take advantage of the Christmas holiday to conclude the meeting satisfactorily. The American side wants Japan to bear the responsibility for the breakdown of the talks when Japan gives notice of the treaty's abrogation. The current position of the Japanese side is to drop the "abrogation notice" bomb. Therefore, the differing positions of the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) On the Washington Treaty issue, Japan advocates abrogation, while the United Kingdom and the United States advocate preservation. (1) On the issue of equal rights, Japan advocates autonomous armament equal rights and equality of national defense security. The United Kingdom and the United States believe that this would undermine equality of national defense security and advocate proportionalism. (1) On the issue of restrictions on armaments methods and holdings, Japan advocates abolishing the differential ratios by warship type, setting a common maximum holding quantity, major reductions in offensive forces, and reductions in total holdings. The United States advocates preserving the existing treaty and reducing holdings by 20% based on differential proportionalism. The United Kingdom hopes to preserve the existing treaty, requiring the holding of seventy lower-tier cruisers and advocating considerable reductions based on qualitative restrictions. (1) On the issue of warship type restrictions, Japan divides between offensive and defensive types. The United States advocates the warship types of the current treaty. Although the United Kingdom recognizes increasing the interchangeability between warship types, it maintains the existing warship types. (1) On the issue of qualitative restrictions, Japan, with substantive equality as a condition, advocates reducing warship tonnage and armament caliber. The United States firmly advocates restricting laws based on the existing system of battleship and big gun doctrine. The United Kingdom advocates reducing the single-ship tonnage of each warship type by 30% and reducing armament caliber. (Seventeenth Day Electric News)</p>

<h3>Saar Unfortunate Incident: British Officer Suspended Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>Public Anger Difficult to Defy, Suffered Severe Beating</p>
<p>Advance Party of British Police Heads to Saar</p>
<p>Saarbrücken  Since the arrival of the international police force here, the first case occurred this evening. A British officer has been suspended pending investigation as a result. According to the announcement, a British officer, Jestyce, while turning his car on the road, hit a pedestrian on the sidewalk. A crowd gathered and took a hostile attitude toward the three people in the car, especially Jestyce, for reasons unknown. A conflict then arose, with several shots fired. One person was shot in the abdomen. Jestyce was beaten and is currently being treated in the hospital. An investigation is underway, and after the results are available, a report will be submitted to the police tribunal ordered to handle this case to punish all persons involved according to law, regardless of their position. At the same time, according to a Berlin Reuters correspondent, the deputy leader of the German Frontline, Nittmann, is said to have filed a protest with the plebiscite committee regarding this case, demanding the punishment of the police officers involved. According to unofficial sources, Jestyce and two friends were driving in a car. During a U-turn, they drove too far and injured the foot of a woman. Onlookers gathered quickly, their demeanor fierce. Jestyce then took out his credentials, claiming to be an officer of the international police force, and asked the crowd to disperse. This further angered the crowd. Jestyce then brandished his pistol at the crowd. Several people snatched his weapon. During the struggle, two bullets flew out, hitting one person in the abdomen, but the injury was not serious. Police rushed to the scene and worked hard to restore order, rescuing Jestyce and his two friends. The three suffered multiple abrasions on their hands and faces, but none were serious. Jestyce later told a Reuters reporter that he had fired a shot into the ground before the crowd snatched his gun, and that the bullets flying out was accidental. He and his friends were all in plain clothes at the time. (Sixteenth Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Course of Events</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken  Details have emerged regarding the unfortunate incident that occurred here at 3 AM this morning. A car carrying three people was driving very fast and crashed into a crowd of pedestrians. The driver was a British police officer, who had been deployed to the Saar region as a special officer several weeks ago. It is said that the incident was caused by the driver being intoxicated and losing control. Four people were knocked down and severely injured. According to eyewitnesses, onlookers immediately called the police and blocked the car from moving forward, saying that it should not be released until the police had investigated. The police officer intended to drive away, and when onlookers stepped forward to stop him, the police officer fired two shots at the crowd, injuring one person. When he tried to fire a third shot, the gun was knocked out of his hand. He continued to rant and rave until he was subdued by the crowd. After the incident, the local people protested loudly, demanding that the authorities punish the police officer.</p>
<h3>Proclamation to the People</h3>
<p>Saar Governing Commission</p>
<p>The following proclamation was then issued: "On the night of December 16, a police officer attempted to turn his car on Goebbels Street and inadvertently crashed into a sidewalk, injuring pedestrians. A crowd gathered and, without knowing the circumstances, protested against the people in the car, especially the police officer. A conflict then arose, resulting in shots being fired and one person being injured in the abdomen. The police officer was also beaten by the crowd and sent to the hospital for treatment. After the police authorities have investigated the matter in detail, a report will be submitted to the court for handling. The police authorities will not show any favoritism. Pending a thorough investigation of the case, the British police officer has been temporarily suspended from duty.</p>
<h3>German Indignation</h3>
<p>The Deputy Director of the German Avant-Garde Corps, Mr. Nittmann, visited the Dutch member of the Saar Plebiscite Commission to protest the illegal actions of the British police officer and solemnly declared that the police officer was not affiliated with the international police force, demanding that the police officer be severely punished to prevent similar incidents from occurring again.</p>
<h3>Urging Calm</h3>
<p>Nittmann also gave a speech during the day to 50,000 Germans in the Saar region, repeatedly urging them to remain calm and saying that we should not regard the police officer's individual actions as the norm in his country.

<h3>Italian Government Sends Note to League of Nations Refuting Abyssinian Protest</h3>
<p>Proves That Abyssinian Troops Actually Initiated Hostilities</p>
<p>Opposes Arbitration, Demands Compensation and Apology</p>
<p>Italian Minister to Abyssinia Returns Home</p>
<p>Rome  The Italian government has sent a notification to the League of Nations regarding the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia in order to prove that the aggression on December 5 was committed by Abyssinia. It states that Walwal has always been within the territory of Italian Somaliland and that Italian troops have occupied the area for many years. Recently, an Abyssinian police officer led a guard of more than 1,000 people protecting the Anglo-Abyssinian Boundary Commission and attempted to enter the area, claiming to the garrison commander that the residents of the area were Abyssinian citizens. The Italian garrison commander refused, and the members of the Boundary Commission withdrew, but the guard remained stationed in front of Walwal, plotting to incite the indigenous troops in the area to desert. On December 5, the Abyssinian troops attacked the Italian garrison without provocation, causing heavy losses. The Italian garrison resisted on the spot and mobilized reinforcements. When the reinforcements arrived, they launched a counterattack in cooperation with airplanes and tanks. The Abyssinian troops then began to flee. After the incident, the Italian government protested to the Abyssinian government and reserved the right to demand an apology and compensation. The Abyssinian government requested that the case be submitted to an arbitration court in accordance with the 1928 Italo-Abyssinian treaty. The Italian government replied that the incident occurred within Italian territory, and the situation was clear. There was no doubt that the matter should be submitted to arbitration. Therefore, the Italian government still maintains that Abyssinia should quickly fulfill the apology and compensation measures. (Sixteenth Day Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Becomes More Right-Wing</h3>
<p>New York  Wall Street today gradually believes that President Roosevelt and his New Deal will become more right-wing in the next few days than before. This right-wing shift has begun, but it has not yet reached its peak. It is said that in order to save face, this change will be accomplished with extreme caution. It is claimed that huge public debts are a major problem for the government. The chairman of Chase Bank, Atley, advocates direct relief and that states and society share part of the funding. Atley opposes work relief because it is uneconomical. Many states have stopped local relief efforts, and all expenses are now borne by the central county government. Experts here declare that saving waste and balancing the budget will automatically stabilize the dollar, while huge public works expenditures and other government measures are considered wasteful. The purpose of public works is work relief. Wall Street merchants now believe that private commerce has catered to President Roosevelt's policies and that the government and big business are cooperating. It is stated here that since the giants of industry and commerce have joined hands with Roosevelt, the concept of industry and commerce has changed. This trend can be seen in the recovery of commerce. (Sixteenth Day National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Stagnant Production and Sales of Tung Oil in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Affected by Stagnation of Foreign Firms in Hankou</p>
<p>Quzhou Correspondence: Silk, tea, and tung oil have always been the main export products of Zhejiang Province. In recent years, silk and tea have been far behind Japan and India/Ceylon, respectively, and have been subject to the low-price dumping of their products, causing business to plummet. However, tung oil has been able to maintain its inherent sales channels due to demand from Europe and the United States. Among the tung oil-producing areas in China, Zhejiang is second only to Sichuan and Hunan. The producing areas are distributed in Chun'an, Sui'an, Yuqian, Changhua, Shouchang, Changshan, Jiangshan, Dongyang, Yiwu, Jinhua, Lanxi, Yongkang, Zhuji, Wuyi, Fenshui, Qu County, Longquan, Songyang, Pingyang, and other counties in eastern and western Zhejiang. The areas are characterized by poor land and impoverished people, and planting tung trees is regarded as the only sideline. Oil pressing operations have flourished in response to demand from all sides. In the past decade, Zhejiang tung oil has formed a three-legged stand with Sichuan and Hunan in domestic and foreign markets, and has gradually become one of Zhejiang's emerging industries, surpassing silk and tea trade. However, future concerns lie in the poor quality of tung seed pressing and the impurity of the oil, which may lead to the elimination of European and American sales. This year, the tung seeds in the producing areas of Chun'an, Changhua, and Yuqian in western Zhejiang, and Lanxi, Yongkang, Jiangshan, and Changshan in eastern Zhejiang, were affected by the severe drought in the summer and autumn, resulting in less fruit and lower oil content. According to estimates by tung planting farmers in the producing areas, the total output of tung seeds in the province this year is about 100,000 dan less than last year, resulting in a significant loss in rural income. Currently, farmers in Lanxi, Jiangshan, and other places have successively organized production cooperatives in order to improve tung oil production and promote European and American markets, jointly seeking development. As for the current sales situation, due to the stagnation of foreign firms in Hankou, the Hangzhou market has followed suit, and only sporadic transactions are taking place in Shanghai, with no large-scale shipments for export. All kinds of goods have arrived at the docks and are languishing in warehouses, with few inquiries. Although US sales have recently increased, pushing up prices in Hankou, domestic sales in the province have fallen, and market prices are only around 26.4 yuan, remaining stagnant. Both production and sales are trending towards a downturn. (12th)</p>
<p>Songjiang: The Educational Community Upholds Justice in the Fenglong Temple Case</p>
<p>Songjiang County Bailongtan Elementary School has been repeatedly disturbed by monks from the Xichan Temple over the Fenglong Temple issue, and the principal has been falsely accused. Details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the educational community in the county, including the County High School, County Teachers' School, Seventh Women's Teachers' School, Provincial Songjiang Elementary School, and Guanyinqiao, Yangjiaqiao, Xidu, Huayang, Mojialong, and other elementary schools, unanimously uphold justice, and jointly sent a telegram to County Governor Jin, requesting the punishment of the monks as a warning against future offenses and to maintain education.</p>
<p>Kunshan: Murder Case Occurs in Zhendong Village</p>
<p>Dozens of households of Guangdong people live in Zhendong Village outside the East Gate. They also formed a Zhendong Company. Kuang, the stepmother of Ma Zuojun, a shareholder of the company, is 35 years old and has lived there with DeMin, the son of the former wife, for a long time. However, the mother and son had different opinions and often quarreled. The other night, Kuang was suddenly shot to death with a hunting gun in the middle of the night, and DeMin's whereabouts are unknown. Neighbors noticed and reported to Ma Ming, the representative of the company, who reported to the county government. This morning at 9 o'clock, Judge Zhang led the inspectors to the village for inspection. It was found that Kuang had twelve gunshot wounds near her left hip, penetrating deep into the bones. There were nine gunshot wounds next to her birth canal, and eighteen bullet exit points on her right trousers, all with torn skin. It was determined that she had been shot and killed with a gun before her death. The coroner completed the report and returned to the county to issue an arrest warrant to investigate the murderer.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Drowns While Arresting Gamblers</h3>
<p>On the 27th of last month, the police from the Malu Public Security Substation were dispatched to arrest gamblers at the home of Lu Wenhuan in Chejiabang, but they were resisted, resulting in the drowning death of police officer Liu Tianwu. Afterwards, the county bureau detained more than ten people, including Zhou Wenyuan and Gu Shixian. After repeated interrogations by Director Wu, they were sent to the county for handling. Unexpectedly, Gu Shixian accused Director Wu of illegal torture to the county government and requested an injury examination. After the county examination, he published the process in the newspaper. Although someone has recently mediated, it has not been completely resolved. Unexpectedly, the other night, Wu Siqin in Mantoubang (8th District) held a wedding for his nephew-in-law, and relatives and friends gathered to gamble. The director of the sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, Bao Renzhai, found out and immediately dispatched police to arrest them. It is not known how, but a dispute arose with the Wu family. Residents of the neighboring village mistakenly thought it was robbery and gathered the crowd, causing police officer Liu Jinshan to fall into the river and drown again. Afterwards, Director Bao found out and urgently reported to the county bureau, which reported to the county government. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang was commissioned to go to the village for inspection. The county bureau also sent people to investigate the beginning and end of the matter, and then conduct further investigation.</p>
<p>Jiading: Two Families Robbed in Yao Dun Bridge</p>
<p>Shen Guisheng, a resident of Yaodun Bridge in the North Guang Township of the First District, operates a military uniform factory in Shanghai and is quite prosperous. His brother was to be married on the 17th. On the evening of the 15th, he bought a large number of wedding supplies in Shanghai and brought them back to his hometown. At about 2 or 3 AM that night, fourteen bandits, each holding flashlights and pistols, broke into the door and forced Shen to hand over the hidden gold. He was robbed of more than 700 yuan in cash and clothing. Shen's brother's bride was Shen Ayun's daughter, who lived in the same house. The bandits then went to Ayun's house to search for clothing and other items. They left around 4 o'clock. The losses of the two families were more than 2,000 gold.</p>
<p>Wuxi: This Year's Silk Factory Survey</p>
<p>Among the machine industries in this county, the yarn industry was established the earliest, and the silk reeling industry has the most factories. The years of 1926 and 1927 were the most prosperous period, with a total of 54 factories in the county. Among them, three were never established, and one was established and reorganized into a cloth factory. There are currently 50 factories in existence. Only 12 factories operated throughout the year, 24 factories operated intermittently, and 14 factories never operated. There are a total of 14,114 silk reeling machines. When all factories are operating, 42,246 male and female workers are required, with female workers accounting for 90% of the total. Although 11,182 machines operated this year, the shortest operation lasted for less than a month. Except for 12 factories such as Huaxin, Yongchun, Jinji, Yongsheng, Longchang, and Minfeng, the rest only operated for two or three months. 13 factories, such as Yuchang, Yuankang, Jinfeng, Qianyuan, Yongyu, Jingcheng, Nanchang, Yongfu, Runxingsheng, Hengyi, Fucheng, Yunda, and Huiyuan, were unable to operate from beginning to end. Therefore, the number of male and female workers employed by these factories this year is less than two-thirds of the peak period. This is the reason for the sluggish market in Xiyi and the difficult life of the workers.</p>
<h3>A Dramatic Fight Between Monks, Nuns, and a Band of Thieves at Fucheng Temple</h3>
<p>In the vicinity of Datun Bridge near the Ninth Branch of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, there is a temple called Fucheng Temple. After the former abbot, Monk De'en, passed away due to illness, his disciple, Leng Qing, took over the management of the temple. Recently, Leng Qing specially invited Monk Changzhao from Kaiyuan Temple in Shaoxing to come to the temple to chant the Seven Buddhas Sutra. Unexpectedly, at about 10 p.m. the day before yesterday, seven or eight thugs suddenly broke in to rob the temple. At that time, Changzhao had not yet fallen asleep and, upon learning of the robbery, grabbed his Zen staff and fiercely fought the thieves. The nun Leng Qing, upon hearing the commotion, also rushed to help in the fight. However, due to being outnumbered, Changzhao suffered eight cuts to his head by the thieves, and Leng Qing was also cut three times. Afterwards, they reported the incident to the Ninth Branch for investigation, but no one was apprehended. Only a hat left behind by the bandits was recovered and reported to the General Bureau for verification. Yesterday, the two monks and nuns were admitted to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Also, in Zhouxiang Village, Xintang Township, Second District, the home of farmer Zhou Yinrong was raided by eight local bandits who broke down the door and robbed over ten dan (a unit of dry weight) of japonica rice. Yinrong was also beaten and injured. The villagers then sounded the gong to surround and apprehend the bandits, who were eventually scared off. The government is handling the case.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Second Annual County-Wide Cross-Country Race</p>
<p>The second annual cross-country race in Wujin County, which had been in preparation for a long time, was held on the afternoon of the 16th. Ninety-three people registered to participate, but only fifty-four actually competed. The starting point of the race was the Rainbow Bridge inside Wenzai Gate, and the finish line was on the road outside Wenzai Gate, a total distance of eight kilometers. At about 2 p.m., the athletes gathered at the starting point. The chief referee and commander, Si Daoping, gave the order, and with a bang, the athletes sprinted forward. Zhang Xuecheng was the first to reach the finish line, with a time of thirty-two minutes and 4/5 of a second, winning the championship. Cao Yaobin was the runner-up, followed by Zhu Qingyun in third place, Leng Dune in fourth, Min Junxiang in fifth, Sha Zhengshang in sixth, Zhang Zhixian in seventh, Xu Jiacheng in eighth, Gu Jinwu in ninth, and Yuan Jinwen in tenth. After the race, an awards ceremony was held at the public sports field. County Magistrate Hou gave a speech before presenting the awards, and then photos were taken before the event concluded.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Head of Second Branch Dismissed for Case</p>
<p>During the Qingming Festival this year in Jiaxing, at the dragon boat race held in Wangjiangjing Town under the jurisdiction of the county, the local police officers failed to maintain order and instead collected fees from the vendors, resulting in a tragic incident in which over twenty men and women were trampled to death on Changhong Bridge. Subsequently, someone reported the dereliction of duty of Chen Riyuan, the head of the Third Public Security Bureau, to the provincial authorities. He was then ordered to be transferred to the position of head of the Second Public Security Bureau of the county. It has now been learned that the Civil Affairs Department has confirmed the county's report that Chen Riyuan was indeed derelict in his duties and should be dismissed from his current position as head of the Second Public Security Bureau as punishment. Wang Shouhe has been appointed to fill the vacancy. After receiving the appointment, Wang arrived at the bureau yesterday to take over his duties.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Forty Bandits Escorted to the Province</p>
<p>The attempted disturbance by the Red Bandits in Suian, Zhejiang, was crushed by the Security Corps, who captured forty suspects, including Red Bandit suspects and local ruffians like Zhou Wangfu, who took advantage of the situation to rob. Yesterday (the 17th), they were escorted to the province by the county's Security Corps. Among them, one named Jiang Dachang died in the car due to illness, and his body was left in front of the Provincial Security Office. In the afternoon, the Hangzhou District Court sent personnel to examine the body and provide a coffin. The remaining criminals were all escorted to the Army Prison for interrogation.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan: Account Boat Robbed in Xixiaojiang River</p>
<p>On the night of the 16th, an account boat travelling from Shaoxing to Linpu in Xiaoshan was robbed in the Xixiaojiang River. The boat carried two shop assistants from a rice store and over 250 yuan in cash. Unexpectedly, when passing the Luomenchen area, they were intercepted by two pirate boats. The pirates silenced the shop assistants and boarded the boat to loot. All the cash was taken, as well as the shop assistants’ silk gowns and scarves. One shop assistant, in an attempt to protect his cotton coat, was stabbed five times in the leg by a bandit with a sharp knife, causing profuse bleeding and causing him to fall unconscious. The victim has reported the incident to the police in Keqiao and Linpu, requesting their cooperation in the investigation.</p>

<h3>Reflections on Anti-Chinese Sentiments: Considering Their Friends and Foes</h3>
<p>By Zhou Qigang</p>
<p>In recent times, the cries of anti-Chinese sentiment from various regions have reached our ears and manifested before our eyes. The noise seems to grow louder every day. In summary, the content boils down to two points: (1) The world's economic panic in recent years has become unbearable, leading to a symbolic perspective of forceful seizure, thus creating a localized misunderstanding of overseas Chinese. (2) Forgetting historical facts and neglecting the interdependent conditions of human existence, resulting in putting the cart before the horse and delusional incitement.</p>
<p>Regarding the former: The world's economic panic of recent years is indeed very different in nature from previous cyclical panics of capitalism. Whether in terms of degree, scope, or continuity, the foundation of the panic is built on general crises. From capitalist countries, it affects the agricultural economy of colonies, causing it to synchronize with the panic of capitalist countries and fall into a deep recession. In places shrouded in this atmosphere of economic panic, merchants go bankrupt, workers lose their jobs, and farmers teeter on the brink of starvation. They all suffer the pain of bankruptcy, unemployment, and hunger, but seeing the unique resilience and hard work of overseas Chinese, who can still struggle to survive in harsh environments, they often cannot overcome the base instinct of jealousy. They blindly transfer their resentment onto the overseas Chinese, believing that worldly possessions are acquired through seizure, not through the rewards of labor. Thus, the agricultural, industrial, and commercial activities of the overseas Chinese are resented by those who live without labor, leading to a sense of dissatisfaction with the overseas Chinese. This subconscious jealousy arises, causing great losses to everyone. Perhaps the losses are even greater in places where anti-Chinese sentiment is more severe.</p>
<p>Amidst this economic downturn, the losses suffered by the overseas Chinese are significant. According to statistics from last year, only 132,000 people emigrated from our country, while 278,000 overseas Chinese returned. This is a decrease of 146,000 people in one year. The amount of remittances sent back to China by overseas Chinese has also been greatly reduced. Last year, it decreased from about 200 million yuan to 80-90%. The significant losses suffered by the overseas Chinese and our national economy are undeniable, and the losses suffered by the various places of residence are also considerable, especially in places with anti-Chinese sentiment, where the economic situation is even more precarious. This putting the cart before the horse will only harm oneself and make things worse!</p>
<p>The sacrifices of the overseas Chinese are indeed their price, but according to our calculations, whether what the overseas Chinese gain is worth the price is questionable. Moreover, whether other nations can compare to the results of this price is another question. According to recent statistics, there are approximately 8 to 10 million overseas Chinese. Based on the number of years and deaths, assuming there are currently 10 million overseas Chinese, the number of our compatriots who have died overseas over the years is at least several times that number. Therefore, the total number of overseas Chinese who have sacrificed themselves to overseas endeavors is in the tens of millions. Further, if we compare the number of overseas Chinese with the amount of money earned, even using the highest figures, the annual remittances sent back to China by overseas Chinese are only 200 million yuan (in fact, this figure only lasted for three or two years). For 10 million people, the money earned each year is 200 million yuan, averaging only 20 yuan per person per year. Considering the long hours of labor that overseas Chinese work each day, which is longer than any other nation, the actual reward of 20 yuan per year means that each overseas Chinese person working in their place of residence for a year is worth 20 yuan. Those who advocate anti-Chinese sentiment should realize this.</p>
<p>Because of misunderstandings between people, many tragedies have been created in history. The anti-Chinese incident must also be said to be one of the unfortunate events caused by misunderstandings between people. We sincerely hope that the concept of anti-Chinese sentiment will be corrected. This is not only our hope, but also a crucial matter that cannot be ignored by various countries in the world.</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, the achievements of the overseas Chinese are by no means accidental or forceful. What the overseas Chinese have gained is not a high price, and it is certainly not a unilateral benefit. If people do not forget historical facts and neglect the interdependent conditions of human existence, the concept of anti-Chinese sentiment will not arise, nor will everyone suffer harm. Originally, many people know the historical facts of overseas Chinese migration to various places, but for the sake of clarity, we will briefly review them:</p>
<p>(1) The Period of Transportation and Visits: Zhang Qian's travels to the Western Regions during the Han Dynasty, Ma Yuan's visit to Jiaozhi, the monk Faxian's journey to the south during the Jin Dynasty, and Zheng He's voyages are all examples of the period of transportation and visits.</p>
<p>(2) The Period of Political Migration: From the Ming to the Qing Dynasties, many Chinese people migrated overseas due to political instability. National laws prohibited emigration, and the Qing Dynasty continued to strictly enforce the ban. This is the period of political migration.</p>
<p>(3) The Period of Commerce and Trade: From the 16th to the 19th centuries, both England and the Netherlands adopted a policy of free immigration to develop barren lands. They actively recruited Chinese laborers and even forcibly transported them to work. In the early 19th century, gold mines were discovered in California and other places in the United States, and the construction of roads required a large number of Chinese laborers. South America also recruited Chinese laborers at this time. It was not until after 1815 that our country temporarily entered into explicit agreements with England, France, and other countries, allowing Chinese citizens to freely emigrate overseas. This can be said to be the period of commerce and trade.</p>
<p>What deserves our attention most is the third period, the period of commerce and trade, because this period was the peak of overseas Chinese development, as well as the period of greatest sacrifice and contribution by overseas Chinese. For example, in the 16th century, the Dutch, due to a lack of suitable labor for developing Southeast Asia, resorted to various means to recruit Chinese laborers. The most peculiar of these was the buying and selling and forced abduction of "piglets" (Chinese laborers). In 1623, the first governor-general of the Dutch East Indies, Coen, wrote a letter to his successor, saying:</p>
<p>"Batavia, Moluccas, Ambon, Banten, need a lot of manpower... There is no one in the world more suitable for our use than the Chinese... If trade cannot be obtained through friendship, now that the weather is good, warships can be sent to the ports of China to capture as many men, women, and children as possible... It is especially necessary to capture many Chinese..."</p>
<p>From the above letter, it can be seen that at that time, the colonial government did not hesitate to use plunder to forcibly bring Chinese people to work in order to develop Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia was like this, and the development of Brazil, Peru, Australia, and other places was not much different, using the method of transporting "piglets." Although a British person once said, "Without the overseas Chinese, there would probably be no Malaysia today," the overseas Chinese do not feel proud or happy when they hear this sentence. Instead, they feel a wave of sadness, which makes them recall the painful experiences of our overseas Chinese ancestors opening up the land from a bloody path.</p>
<p>According to page 180 of the General History of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, in the early days of developing a certain mountain field in Southeast Asia, it was estimated that it would take about half a year to complete the work. Therefore, 50 "piglets" (Chinese laborers) were recruited. Unexpectedly, within half a year, only two survived. The other 48 died due to labor and disease. Since the reclamation of the mountain field was less than halfway completed, another 50 "piglets" were recruited to fill the ranks. After another half a year, the work was finally completed, but only 14 of the second batch of "piglets" survived. In total, 100 "piglets" were used to develop one mountain field, and 84 died in one year. If we add up the various mountain fields that have been developed in Southeast Asia, Central and South America, Australia, and other places, then the number of overseas Chinese lives sacrificed is probably not something that any monetary figure can express. If we do not observe the history of the colonial development of overseas Chinese struggling and sacrificing, we will not understand the inside story of the modern economic prosperity process.</p>
<p>The contribution of overseas Chinese to the local development and prosperity is clear from the historical process described above. It seems that those who advocate anti-Chinese sentiment should take a break. However, now that human competition is moving further and further down the path of contradiction, the treatment of overseas Chinese in some places has been turned upside down. We also believe that today's advocates of anti-Chinese sentiment are not completely illiterate, but they have neglected the interdependent conditions of human existence, leading to the misunderstanding that the efforts of the overseas Chinese are "forceful seizure" rather than a "living gift" to the local community. We hope they will eventually have the opportunity to understand this clearly. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The "Harvard" Sunk After Collision Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Importing Foreign Rice from Siam</p>
<p>On the Jiangmian River Surface in Lujiazui, Pudong</p>
<p>Head-On Collision with the "Tongde"</p>
<p>Cargo Lost, Crew Safe</p>
<p>The Norwegian ship "Harvard," Herver, represented by Messageries Maritimes, No. 6 Sichuan Road, agent of Hong Kong's Ng Kwong Tsi Lung, was carrying 16,500 bags of foreign rice, totaling 1,700 tons, from Bangkok, Siam. The rice was purchased by local Chinese merchants. The ship first arrived in Hong Kong and then came to Shanghai. At 7:15 a.m. yesterday, the ship arrived at Wusong and immediately entered the port, sailing into the Huangpu River, preparing to unload at the Yitai Hing Wharf. At 8:45 a.m., when it reached the Jiangmian River surface in Lujiazui, opposite the Waibaidu Bridge, it collided with the "Tongde," represented by Taifoo Co., Hankou Road, resulting in a tragic sinking.</p>
<p>Collision of Two Ships: The "Tongde" was an empty ship yesterday morning, heading from Shanghai to Qingdao to load coal. At 8:45 a.m., it reached the Jiangmian River surface in Lujiazui, heading north from the south and turning east. The "Harvard" was heading west from the east and turning south. The two ships then collided. It was found that the current was strongest at that point, and it was also high tide. When the "Tongde" and "Harvard" approached each other, neither side sounded the whistle. In a split second, the bow of the "Tongde" violently collided with the left side of the "Harvard's" fore cabin, resulting in the disaster.</p>
<p>The "Harvard" Sinks: A large hole was punched on the left side of the bow of the "Harvard," the damage was below the waterline of the cargo hold. River water immediately rushed into the fore cabin, and the bow immediately sank. Further, because it was fully loaded with foreign rice, the pressure was too great, and the ship lost its buoyancy. In a short time, the second, third, and fourth cabins were also flooded. In less than half an hour, it sank on the Jiangmian River surface in Lujiazui. Initially, the entire upper deck was still visible above the water, but by the afternoon, the upper decks of the front and middle cabins had also submerged, with only the stern of the ship visible in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Crew Rescued: After the accident, the Jianghai Customs and Lujiazui Water Police Station urgently dispatched the "Lihai Jinghui" small steam launch and sampans to Lujiazui. They first rescued 31 stokers from the "Harvard," as well as the captain, first and second officers, and engineers, a total of 13 people, and temporarily housed them in the police station. Later, Ng Kwong Tsi Lung's Shanghai office and Messageries Maritimes manager Tsang Kwong-king arranged to accommodate the crew temporarily in local Shanghai hotels, awaiting telegrams from the shipowner to determine the next course of action. Therefore, all the crew and sailors of the "Harvard" were unharmed.</p>
<p>Ship Body Towed to Shore: After Messageries Maritimes received the accident report of the "Harvard," Tsang Kwong-king immediately consulted Jardine Matheson, who dispatched two tugboats to Lujiazui. Because the area is a major waterway for ships, the sunken "Harvard" was significantly obstructing navigation. Therefore, during high tide, the tugboats gradually towed the ship to a shallower area on the Pudong bank near the Chunjiang Wharf on the side of the Lujiazui Water Police Station and ran it aground. The tugboats were positioned on either side of the sunken ship to prevent it from sinking into the center of the river.</p>
<p>Sunken Ship Markers: Navigation for ships in the area of the sunken "Harvard" was quite inconvenient. The crew immediately hoisted four green flags on the tops of the two masts to provide a warning. At night, red lights were hung to avoid collisions with passing ships. The municipal ferries on the Chunjiang line were forced to detour because the exit from the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong was blocked by the sunken ship, making travel even more inconvenient at night.</p>
<p>Inspectors Dispatched: After receiving the report about the "Harvard," Messageries Maritimes immediately dispatched Deputy Manager Li Zhi-yi to Taifoo Co. to order a surveyor to go to the site to investigate and devise a method to salvage the rice loaded in the ship. After receiving the report, Taifoo Co. immediately dispatched a surveyor to the site of the accident in Lujiazui. The matter of determining responsibility for the collision will be handled after the surveyor's report. The two parties will need to hire impartial inspectors and summon the crews of both ships for questioning before a determination can be made. At present, it cannot be determined, so neither party is willing to make any statements.</p>
<p>Amount of Losses: The "Harvard" was registered as 761 tons, with a cargo capacity of 2,000 tons. It was built in 1921 by the Shanghai Ruirong Shipyard and was 242 feet and 7 inches long, 37 feet and 2 inches wide, and 15 feet deep. The single-deck cabin was owned by a Norwegian merchant and was leased to Ng Kwong Tsi Lung's timber firm to load 1,600 tons of Bangkok rice, approximately 16,500 bags, valued at over 200,000 yuan. The ship itself was worth over 200,000 yuan, for a total loss of over 400,000 yuan. The losses of the "Tongde" are not included. The "Harvard's" hull was insured for 200,000 yuan in Norway by the Shanghai Norwegian firm Shun Heng Co., and the rice cargo was insured for 200,000 yuan by the British firm New Zealand Insurance Company. Messageries Maritimes has already notified Ng Kwong Tsi Lung's timber firm to inform the two insurance companies that insured the hull and cargo.</p>

<p>Salvaging Rice: Messageries Maritimes believed that the rice was already soaked in water and that if it was not salvaged immediately, the ship would inevitably explode when the rice swelled. Therefore, yesterday morning, Jardine Matheson's tugboat company was asked to dispatch tugboats to salvage the rice. Starting at 10 a.m. yesterday, Jardine Matheson dispatched three large tugboats with cargo cranes and a large number of workers to the site to open the cargo hold doors and lift the rice. The "Harvard" is now leaning against the beach, with the deck submerged in water. Only the stern, smokestack, and flag are visible above the water. It is not expected to sink any further. Jardine Matheson's tugboats are parked beside the ship, working to salvage the rice. Water police officers have been dispatched to the scene. Many onlookers are on the shore. It is said that even if the waterlogged rice is salvaged, it cannot be eaten and can only be used to make alcohol, etc.</p>
<p>"Tongde" Suspended: The senior officers of the "Harvard" were Norwegian, and the junior officers were Chinese. The compradore was Lai Ying-xiang, for a total of 44 people. After seeing the ship sink, they immediately removed all their luggage, bedding, and important ship documents and went ashore. At the same time, the "Tongde" immediately suspended operations and attempted to provide assistance. However, the "Harvard" was heavily loaded, the river water had already entered, and the ship was gradually sinking, so there was nothing that could be done. Moreover, the bow of the "Tongde" was also damaged, the rivets had fallen out, and the bow was skewed. Although there was no major damage, it could not sail until it had been repaired. Therefore, it was forced to return to the No. 43 floating buoy at Gaochangmiao to moor and reported the collision to Taifoo Co., its agent.</p>

<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Clears Old Arrears of Land Tax</h3>
<p>The land tax in various districts of this city used to adopt a "bundled guarantee" system. In the old Shanghai County area, after each collection deadline, the incomplete tax payment lists were given to the local guarantors (地保) to collect on behalf of the government. In the old Baoshan County area, the local guarantors received the lists a year after the deadline to collect on behalf of the government. The local guarantors were bundled on a yearly rotating basis and did not hand over the uncollected tax lists to each other. If a citizen had several years of land tax arrears, they had to pay to each of the local guarantors who had handled the matter, and only after the old arrears were cleared could they pay the new tax. However, the local guarantors were scattered in various rural areas and had no fixed office location or business hours, making tax payments very inconvenient. Therefore, many of the arrears over the years were indeed due to taxpayers being unwilling to pay, but many were also due to the inconvenience of the procedures. It is reported that from the Republic of China year 17 to year 22, the amount of land tax arrears collected on behalf of the government by the local guarantors amounted to more than 500,000 yuan. After the Finance Bureau took over land tax collection this year, it was deeply concerned that the arrears would increase, making future clearing even more difficult. Furthermore, according to the resolution of the previous National Finance Conference, it was stipulated that tax collection should not be carried out by roaming around with the payment lists. The Finance Bureau therefore submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval to abolish the payment list method from this year onwards and instead have the various land tax offices directly collect the tax. It is also heard that the bureau has formulated a method for clearing old arrears of land tax in order to thoroughly clear the old arrears and facilitate tax payments for citizens, which has been approved by the Provincial Government for implementation. This method will be carried out in stages. The first step is to clearly check the payment lists held by the local guarantors and collect all uncollected payment lists. The second step is to set a deadline after the old arrears payment lists have been collected, and the various land tax collection offices will collect the tax, allowing citizens to directly pay into the treasury. By doing so, citizens will have a fixed place and time to pay their old arrears of land tax, which will be much more convenient. It is also stipulated that those who pay their old arrears within the deadline will be exempt from late payment penalties and will have one-tenth of the arrears reduced. Those who do not pay within the deadline will be detained for collection or have their property forcibly executed to collect the arrears and late payment penalties as a warning. The method for clearing old arrears of land tax is extracted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The old arrears of land tax from the Republic of China year 17 to year 22 shall be cleared in accordance with this method. (2) Within 15 days after the approval of this method, each land tax collection office shall prepare a register for each district map, listing the following items year by year, and report it to the bureau for verification: A. For those whose payment lists have not been given to the local guarantors, the number of households and the amount of land tax owed shall be indicated; B. For those whose payment lists have been given to the local guarantors, the name and address of the local guarantor, the number of payment lists given, the total amount, the amount paid, and the amount owed shall be indicated. (3) Within 15 days after preparing the register and reporting to the bureau, each land tax collection office shall summon the local guarantors in each district to clear the accounts with the outstanding tax payment lists, etc., and the bureau shall send personnel to supervise. (4) The following items shall be verified during the clearing: A. The total amount of silver on the payment lists received by each local guarantor; B. Whether the total amount of silver on the existing outstanding tax payment lists is consistent with the amount owed to the land tax collection office. (5) All outstanding tax payment lists held by each local guarantor shall be collected immediately after the clearing. The local guarantor, the director of the land tax collection office, the tax collector, and the committee member of the bureau shall stamp each payment list on the spot, indicating the date of collection for identification, and the land tax collection office shall keep them in custody. (6) Each land tax collection office shall prepare a register for each district map, showing the clearing situation of each local guarantor and the total number and amount of outstanding tax payment lists collected, and report it to the bureau for verification. (7) After the clearing, the local guarantors shall still be responsible for urging collection. (8) The collection of old arrears of land tax shall be limited to three months, and each taxpayer shall pay into the treasury themselves. However, each land tax collection office shall still order the tax collection police to cooperate with the local guarantors in urging collection. (9) In order to facilitate tax payments for taxpayers, the bureau may, depending on the circumstances, temporarily set up land tax collection sub-offices in districts with a large amount of arrears. (10) Taxpayers who pay their old arrears of land tax on time shall be exempt from late payment fees and shall have one-tenth of the total amount of their arrears waived. (11) Those who still fail to clear their arrears after the deadline shall be summoned by the bureau in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau for collection, or shall be forcibly executed in accordance with the law. (12) If any local guarantor avoids appearing for clearing after being summoned, each land tax collection office may request the bureau to detain them in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau for clearing. (13) If any tax collector or local guarantor embezzles old arrears of land tax or engages in malpractice in tax collection matters, they shall be sent to the court for investigation in accordance with the law. (14) The embezzlement of old arrears of land tax by local guarantors shall be recovered from the local guarantor and the responsible personnel or guarantors specified in the bundled agreement, and shall be paid in full within a time limit, but the period shall not exceed three months at the latest. The recovery of embezzled old arrears of land tax shall be handled in accordance with Article 11. (15) Those who are responsible for urging the collection of old arrears of land tax and are negligent in their duties shall be punished. (16) Five percent of the total amount of old arrears of land tax collected shall be set aside as a bonus. (17) The bonus shall be calculated separately according to the old tax of each map and each year, and shall be distributed as follows: A. The local guarantor shall account for 40%, but only for the map and year of collection; B. The tax collection police and tax collectors shall account for 40%; C. The tax collection personnel of the land tax collection office shall account for 20%. (18) Those who are responsible for urging the collection of old arrears of land tax and are in one of the situations in Articles 12 and 13 of this method shall not participate in the distribution of bonuses. Those who are in the situation in Article 15 of this method shall be dealt with as appropriate. (19) The clearing of old arrears of land tax is a complicated matter, and additional personnel may be added to handle it. The expenses shall be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval separately. (20) This method may be revised by the bureau at any time for matters not covered, and shall be submitted to the Municipal Government for record. (21) This method shall be implemented upon approval by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Make General Donations</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Emergency Relief General Donation Association, the director-general and staff have been working day and night, extremely busy. Various newspapers have reported on the general donations from various schools. The Municipal Education Bureau and the association previously convened a meeting of principals from major primary and secondary schools, originally scheduled to end on the 15th. However, due to some schools being located in rural areas or facing obstacles, they were unable to collect donations and obtain receipts on time, so they have requested an extension. Given the special circumstances of the schools, the association has agreed to the extension and has urged the schools that have not yet received receipts to collect them as soon as possible. A public notice was issued in the newspapers yesterday to inform all schools to collect them as soon as possible so that the matter can be concluded soon. Yesterday, many schools were still enthusiastically collecting receipts, including Dongxin Elementary School, Tangpan Elementary School, Zhuzhai Elementary School, Wushi Elementary School, Sacred Heart Elementary School, North-South City Customs Guild Righteous School, Jie Ru Elementary School, Xie Xie Elementary School, Zhou Wan Elementary School, Yi Zhao Elementary School, Tong Shan Elementary School, and over 20 other schools.

<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard previously received various general donation receipts from the Emergency Relief Association, requesting them to solicit donations from staff and workers. It is reported that they have already paid 100 yuan in silver dollars.</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief General Donation Association of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward to various trade associations, urging them to quickly raise general donations from their respective trades to help the disaster victims. The association has received replies from various trade associations, stating that they are in the process of raising funds and that donations will be coming in soon.</p>
<p>General donations from factory staff and workers have already begun. The Emergency Relief General Donation Association previously sent a letter to more than 2,700 factories in the city, requesting them to deduct the wages of their respective staff and workers and remit them to the Shanghai Bank for collection. It is reported that many factories have been sending donations to the Shanghai Bank recently.</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief General Donation Association received a letter from the Nanjing Road Business Federation yesterday, stating that the disaster situation in various places is extremely serious and the disaster victims are in dire need of assistance. They have organized a donation solicitation committee to conduct solicitations from member stores along Nanjing Road. They have already raised 2,000 yuan and inquired about the donation payment procedures. The Emergency Relief Association replied in a letter, requesting them to send personnel to make the payment. They deeply hope that all businesses will actively donate to support this righteous cause.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Purchased a New Giant Boeing Aircraft</h3>
<p>Test Flight at Longhua Airport Yielded Good Results</p>
<p>Specially Prepared for Personal Use, Zhang Will Take the Aircraft to Return to Wuhan</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression, previously presented Chiang Kai-shek with a Ford aircraft that he had prepared himself. Now, for the convenience of his personal travel, he has specifically ordered a large "Boeing" passenger aircraft from England. The aircraft was shipped from England to Shanghai by ship last month and then transferred to Longhua Airport for installation. The installation was completed separately last week, and a test flight was carried out at Longhua Airport on the afternoon of the 16th (the day before yesterday). The test flight lasted for more than an hour and the results were good. This aircraft is produced by British National Airlines and is the same type as the aircraft that won third place in the England-Australia long-distance flight competition a few months ago. The aircraft body is extremely large and worth millions. Its appearance is like a fortress, with two engines and can carry ten passengers and two pilots at the same time. The speed is approximately 140 miles per hour, and it has various insurance safety equipment. It is also learned that after the successful test flight the day before yesterday, the aircraft will fly to Beijing within a few days, where Mr. Zhang will personally test it. When Mr. Zhang returns to Wuhan, he may also take this aircraft.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary People's Movements</h3>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Prepares to Open a Sichuan-Yunnan Air Route</h3>
<p>Ordered Two Giant Aircraft from the United States</p>
<p>Expected to Open the Route in May or June of Next Year</p>
<p>In order to develop transportation in the Sichuan-Yunnan border area, the Ministry of Communications has decided to open a Sichuan-Yunnan air route, with the ministry allocating 250,000 yuan for operating expenses, and ordering China National Aviation Corporation to be responsible for the preparation. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency inquired about the preparations from the company yesterday, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Test Flight Once The distance of the Sichuan-Yunnan air route is 216 miles from Chongqing, Sichuan to Guiyang, Guizhou, and 264 miles from Guiyang to Kunming, Yunnan, for a total length of 480 miles. However, there are many mountains and unpredictable weather along the way. Last year, the company sent Nie Kaiyi, Deputy Director of the Aviation Group, Huang Baoxian, Director of the Business Group, and others to fly a test flight, and the results were good.</p>
<p>Purchase New Aircraft After the last test flight, it was deeply felt that there were many mountains along the route and the weather was also constantly changing, so it was necessary to use a well-equipped and powerful land aircraft to be applicable. The company is currently planning to order two double-engine Parker aircraft or other more sturdy giant aircraft from the United States, but this matter is still under discussion and awaits final decision. It is rumored that the purchase of Sikorsky aircraft is inaccurate, as that type of aircraft is a seaplane and not suitable for land flight.</p>
<p>Open the Route Next Year After being ordered to open this air route, China National Aviation Corporation immediately began active preparations. The Ministry of Communications has decided to allocate 250,000 yuan for operating expenses. In addition to a small portion already received, the remainder can be drawn from the Ministry of Communications at any time as needed. The company is currently planning to purchase the new aircraft and transport them to China first, then conduct another test flight before officially opening the route on a fixed date. However, it will not be realized until May or June of next year at the earliest. At that time, after the opening of this route, it will conduct consultations with Southwest Aviation Corporation's Guangdong-Yunnan air route to handle joint transportation.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Stipulates Ticket Prices for the Shanghai-Guangdong Route</h3>
<p>In addition to increasing the number of mail flights on the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong route starting next month, with one southbound flight on Tuesdays and one northbound flight on Thursdays each week, passenger transport will also officially begin at the same time. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency has inquired about the one-way and round-trip ticket prices for this route, as follows:</p>
<p>One-Way Prices From Shanghai to Wenzhou, 70 yuan; to Fuzhou, 130 yuan; to Xiamen, 175 yuan; to Shantou, 200 yuan; to Guangzhou, 270 yuan.</p>
<p>Round-Trip Fares Passengers who purchase round-trip tickets will receive a slight discount compared to one-way tickets. From Shanghai to Wenzhou, 125 yuan; to Fuzhou, 230 yuan; to Xiamen, 305 yuan; to Shantou, 350 yuan; to Guangzhou, 470 yuan. The validity period of the above round-trip tickets is one month.</p>
<p>Baggage Fees In addition, passengers carrying baggage exceeding 33 pounds will be charged an excess baggage fee, calculated per pound based on the distance of the route. From Shanghai to Wenzhou, 35 cents; to Fuzhou, 65 cents; to Xiamen, 90 cents; to Shantou, 1 yuan; to Guangzhou, 1 yuan and 35 cents.</p>
<h3>Currency System Research Association Appoints Specialist Members</h3>
<p>Adds Five New Members Including Xi Zhi</p>
<p>The Currency System Research Committee of the Ministry of Finance has previously appointed 24 members, including Zhang Gongquan and Wu Dingchang, and established a committee in Beijing to actively carry out the work of unifying the currency system. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has specifically added Wu Xizhi, Liu Dajun, Yu Huanzheng, Gu Jigao, and Bian Bomei as members in order to solicit more expert opinions and strengthen the work force. An office has also been established in Shanghai at the Central Bank so that the members in Shanghai can discuss matters nearby. It will be moved into and begin operating within a few days.</p>

<p>All Telegraph and Postal Branches in the City Can Receive and Send Them</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications promulgated domestic social telegrams, they have been well received by all sectors due to their low cost and rapid transmission. It is learned that the Shanghai Telegraph Office is actively promoting this method of sending and receiving social telegrams, and is providing senders with simple and convenient methods in various ways to provide preferential treatment to all sectors. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Social Telegrams Are Particularly Inexpensive</p>
<p>Domestic social telegrams have now been adjusted by the Ministry of Communications. All telegrams exchanged between various places in the country that are of a social nature can be received and sent according to specific methods, but only in Chinese or English clear text. These telegrams are marked with "交際" (social) or the English letters SLT before the name and address of the recipient. The cost of these telegrams is extremely low. For Chinese, the minimum is 20 characters, and each character costs only 2 cents of a silver dollar. For English, the minimum is 10 characters, and each character costs 4 cents of a silver dollar. If the number of characters is insufficient, the cost will still be calculated based on these minimums. Beyond these minimums, the cost will only be calculated by the number of characters.</p>
<p>Most Suitable for New Year and Christmas Greetings</p>
<p>As the telegrams are named "social," they are limited to social matters. They can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) Congratulating the New Year, Christmas, marriage, birth of a child, birthdays, opening of a business, promotions, etc.; (2) Condolences for deaths, condolences for disasters and illnesses; and (3) Thank-you events regarding the above congratulations and condolences. Because the cost of these telegrams is particularly low, the text of the telegrams is limited to the above three types of matters and may not include other matters. For example, when sending a telegram to relatives and friends in a certain place to wish them a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, one can directly write "恭祝聖誕並賀新禧" (Wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year) below the name and address of the recipient (for Chinese, the recipient's address and name are limited to 15 characters, and only 5 characters are charged), and include the sender's name. Such a telegram would only cost 4 dimes. The text is concise and clear at a glance. Furthermore, the Telegraph Office will uniformly translate all Chinese social telegrams into code for transmission. After the receiving telegraph office receives the telegram, it will still be translated into text and sent to the recipient. No translation fees are charged for this procedure.</p>
<p>Winter Solstice Social Paper Uses Color</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Office is making every effort to promote Winter Solstice social telegrams this time, and has prepared exquisite colored telegram paper specifically for celebrating Christmas and congratulating the New Year, in order to allow senders and receivers to increase friendship and especially love and cherish them.</p>
<p>Telegraph and Postal Offices Can Receive and Send Them</p>
<p>All sectors who need to send various telegrams or social telegrams can send them at the General Office at 200 Sichuan Road, 565 Minguo Road, Sassoon Building on Renji Road, 15 Avenue Edward VII branch offices, and more than 30 postal branches in the city, which is truly convenient.</p>
<h3>Situation of the Creditors' Meeting of Jiande Bank</h3>
<p>After Jiande Bank announced the suspension of business, it must be resolved by the shareholders' meeting whether to liquidate in accordance with the law. Therefore, it is only announcing the temporary suspension of business. The board of directors and manager entrusted accountant Pan Xulun of Lixin Accounting Firm and lawyers Cai Liu Cheng and Qu Yue to handle all legal matters. Accountant Pan and others believed that the bank had been suspended for almost ten days, and the creditors did not know the actual situation of the progress, which would easily lead to misunderstandings. Therefore, it was decided to hold a meeting with the creditors at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 17th) at the auditorium of the Shanghai YMCA on Sichuan Road. 226 creditors attended. Lawyer Qu and Accountant Pan will reduce losses as much as possible, so they will proceed with "fairness," "speed," and "economy." The funds received will be deposited in reliable banks. However, a detailed report can only be made after the accounts have been cleared. During the meeting, creditor representatives spoke to each other, and the main points were: some asked how to handle savings, some asked how to clear bills, and some asked about losses and directors, etc. Accountant Pan was allowed to report the bank's accounts and assets and liabilities one by one, and answered each question raised by the creditors openly. A detailed situation must be reported after a detailed review of the accounts. If the creditors formally convene a meeting and elect representatives, they can investigate at any time. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM. However, since it was only a report nature on that day, the creditor certificates were not checked. Later, after the procedures are fully prepared, it can only be formally carried out after registering with the creditor certificate. As for the creditor side, they immediately discussed the method of proceeding in order to seek a quick resolution based on the facts. In addition, it was reported that after Jiande Bank announced the temporary suspension of business on the 8th, creditors such as Lu Zhaoji rushed to the law offices of Shen Zongyong and Yang Shaozhi and commissioned them to handle the matter, and requested to convene other creditors to jointly organize a creditor group. Yesterday, the bank convened a meeting of creditors to report on the bank's accounts, but the general creditors expressed disagreement and it is rumored that they will file a lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Telegraphed Back to the Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association</h3>
<p>Adopting the Association's Seven Suggestions</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, taking advantage of the fact that Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression, went to Beijing to ask the central government for instructions on the bandit suppression method, sent a telegram proposing seven methods for Sichuan affairs, and Liu has expressed his sincere acceptance. The text of his reply telegram is recorded as follows: (Omitted titles) I have received the telegram of the day before yesterday. Your concern for your homeland and your expression of great views are righteous and solemn, and I dare not fail to appreciate them. Xiang has completed asking for instructions on various matters in Beijing and will return to Sichuan in a few days. The seven items mentioned in your telegram will be implemented in order of priority. The difficulties in Sichuan have not been resolved, and everyone is responsible. I hope you will continue to give me your teachings so that we can work together in the same boat. Respectfully report, and wish you a pleasant journey. Liu Xiang, bowed.</p>
<h3>Xu Jianping Will Go to the Philippines Today</h3>
<p>In order to rescue the economic recession of overseas Nanyang compatriots, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi has specially sent Xu Jianping, Director of the General Affairs Department of the ministry, to Nanyang, the Philippines, and other places to conduct preliminary investigations in order to provide relief. Mr. Xu is scheduled to depart this afternoon with his wife from Shanghai on the Dollar Steamship Company's President Coolidge, and will conduct a three-week investigation after arriving in the Philippines, and then return to China to report to the Ministry of Finance in order to carry out relief based on the results of his investigation.</p>
<h3>Extorting Thugs Arrested by Police</h3>
<p>Chen Arong, a 28-year-old Danyang native, recently opened the Chen Yong Noodle Shop at No. 28 Guan Yi Lane in the city. Fearing that local thugs and hoodlums (the so-called "Thirty-Six Gang") would demand exorbitant fees upon opening, he entrusted Chen Aliou, a fellow tradesman known to be acquainted with such individuals, to handle the matter. Chen, being a clever thug himself and having dealings with local natives, agreed. However, yesterday morning at 10:40, a notorious thug named Bai Zhuxiang, along with Lu Guoliang, a local hoodlum with a history of punishment, went to Chen Yongtai Noodle Shop demanding "opening expenses" but received nothing. Subsequently, Bai and others discovered that Chen Aliou had received three silver dollars but had not shared the profits. They then took Chen to a nearby teahouse to discuss the matter. Words turned into violence, and a brawl ensued. Bai Zhuxiang suffered a head wound and bled profusely. When patrol officer Zhang Junshan arrived after receiving a report, he attempted to arrest them, but the hoodlum Lu Guoliang dared to resist arrest and commit violence, blatantly disregarding the law. With the help of neighboring officers, Chen Aliou, Lu Guoliang, and Bai Zhuxiang were all arrested and taken to the county temple police station for questioning. After questioning, Director Liu found that the defendants had been extorting fees and disrupting the peace. He deemed that strict punishment was necessary to reassure the community and ordered them to be transferred to the general bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Tragic Death of Craftsman by Electrocution</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the electrical wiring near the toilet inside the Shanghai-Taiwan Hotel on the Fourth Avenue suddenly malfunctioned. Around 12:30 noon, the hotel manager called Wu Fusheng, a Wuxi native and worker at the Zhenchang Electrical Appliance Store on Gongping Road (age 32), to repair it. Unfortunately, due to a moment of carelessness, he was suddenly electrocuted and collapsed, losing consciousness. People called for the patrol police, who rushed him to Renji Hospital in ambulance No. 83. However, the rescue efforts were unsuccessful, and he soon died.</p>
<h3>Three Cases Reported for Autopsy</h3>
<p>(Unnamed Male Corpse on Tongjia Road) Yesterday, the Shanghai Local Court received a report from local security guard Li Er'er, stating that an unidentified female corpse, approximately 40 years old, was found yesterday morning at the entrance of Jingxing Lane on Tongjia Road in Zhabei. She was wearing a blue cloth jacket, lined with a black padded coat, black padded pants, and yellow thread socks. After investigation, the police reported the case to the relevant police station, ordering an autopsy.</p>
<p>(Zhan A'mei Died of Stomach Illness) According to local security guard Lu Yongde, on the 7th of this month, three travelers named Zhan A'mei, Chen Jinlou, and Wei A'cai from Xinghua, Fujian, were selling olives at the Kaitai Inn on Xintai Lane outside the Bund. They rented room number 14. Zhan A'mei suffered from a stomach illness that would flare up and subside. Before coming to Shanghai, her old illness relapsed. Medical treatment was ineffective, and she died around 10 p.m. the night before. The First District Police Bureau was informed and ordered an autopsy.</p>
<p>(Jiang Fujun Died by Electrocution) According to local security guard Gu Xueyuan, Jiang Fujun, a 14-year-old apprentice at the redwood workshop run by Yi Dakang from Suzhou at No. 19 Taixing Lane, 180 Puyu West Road, somehow died by electrocution the day before yesterday evening. Because the case involved a human life, in addition to reporting to the relevant police station, this case was reported for an autopsy. After receiving the report, the court dispatched prosecutor Lei Binzhang and forensic investigators to inspect the scene and determine the cause of death. They ordered the body to be coffined and await further instructions.</p>

<h3>City Ferry Simultaneously Operates Transferring Foreign Ship Passengers</h3>
<p>Yesterday Received Passengers of the Dutch Ship "Tjibadak"</p>
<p>League of Nations Technical Expert Praises Highly</p>
<p>The city ferry operated by the Shanghai Industrial Trust Society has more than eleven ferries. With complete facilities, safety and convenience, punctual timing, and low fares, the ferry has rapidly improved over the years. Not only do citizens traveling back and forth between the east and west banks of the Huangpu River find it convenient and praise it, but foreign residents who have ridden the city ferry also express their satisfaction. The Dutch Java Shipping Company, which enjoys a strong reputation in the shipping industry, prefers passengers who travel through Luzon and Hong Kong to take their ships. Currently, the Java Company believes that the city ferry operates perfectly, so they have specially negotiated to charter ferries to transfer passengers. Yesterday (the 17th), the company's "Tjibadak" S.S. arrived in Shanghai, and the No. 5 city ferry went to pick up passengers. All passengers expressed satisfaction. Mr. G.P. Nijhoff, a technical cooperation commissioner sent to China by the League of Nations, arrived in Shanghai on the "Tjibadak" ship and also boarded the No. 5 city ferry, praising the ferry's facilities highly.</p>
<h3>French Flag Suddenly Hung on the Roof of the New World</h3>
<p>Qiu Peilin Illegally Borrows the Power of Foreigners</p>
<p>The Court Has Already Issued an Arrest Warrant</p>
<p>Qiu Peilin, a wealthy merchant from Nanxun, previously leased land and buildings around the New World near Jing'an Temple Road from Cheng Linsheng, Cheng Zimao, and Cheng Ji. He opened an amusement park. However, because Qiu violated the terms of the lease, the owners Cheng Linsheng, etc., sued the First Special District Local Court to terminate the contract. After three trials, the court ruled in favor of Cheng, and the Civil Execution Office of the First Special Court ordered Qiu Peilin to vacate the premises by the 15th of last month. Unexpectedly, on the 14th of last month, a notice from the real estate department of the French-owned Baishanlong Foreign Company was suddenly hung on the iron railing at the entrance of the New World, claiming that Baishanlong had the right to occupy the leased land and buildings on Jing'an Temple Road, Xizang Road, and Baker Road, and a French flag was hung on the roof to resist the execution order of the First Special Court. This kind of situation of illegally borrowing the power of foreigners and resisting the orders of the national court not only damages China's legal rights but also insults the national dignity. If it is not severely punished, the credibility of national laws will be lost. Therefore, Cheng Linsheng and others hired lawyers Wu Zhiping and Li Zhaofu to file a complaint against Qiu with the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court in accordance with Article 384 of the Criminal Law regarding the crime of destruction, requesting strict investigation and punishment as a warning to others. Yesterday afternoon, judge Ye Shengchao opened the Fifth Criminal Court for questioning. The plaintiffs Wu and Li were present in court. After Wu explained the case, Ye declared that the case had already been publicly prosecuted by the police, and the court had issued an arrest warrant. Since the arrest was unsuccessful, an arrest warrant has now been issued for Qiu's arrest. Therefore, since the public prosecution came first, the private prosecution could not proceed. If the private prosecutor knew Qiu's whereabouts, they could hand him over to the police for court proceedings. Wu expressed acceptance, and Ye then announced that the private prosecution was rejected. The reporter then inquired with Ru Baoyi of the Legal Department of the Public Works Department. According to Ru, after receiving the report, the police department filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court in accordance with Article 384 of the Criminal Law. Because the arrest was unsuccessful, an arrest warrant has been issued.</p>
<h3>Qu Guocheng Charged with Murder Case</h3>
<p>Qu Has a Very Long Confession</p>
<p>Stating That He Absolutely Could Not Have Committed Murder</p>
<p>丨 Result: Released on Bail and Ordered to Surrender to the Local Court 丨</p>
<p>On January 2nd of this year, the body of a young man was found assassinated with a handgun in the Caijiazhai area of Longhua. After investigation, the deceased was identified as Xu Jinhui, a native of this county, 21 years old, residing at No. 72 Keming Road, North Sichuan Road, son of a woman named Xu Wan. After the local court's procuratorate examined the body, they ordered it to be claimed and coffined. However, in May of this year, Xu Wan suddenly accused Qu Guocheng, a Shanghai native and former clerk of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation, of being the murderer of her son to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. According to the accusation, the Public Security Bureau dispatched detective team leader Gao Wansheng, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, to arrest Qu at his residence at No. 11 Yannanfang, 1603 Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, but they were unsuccessful. However, at 2:50 p.m. the day before yesterday, Xu Wan suddenly encountered Qu at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Laoyalu Road. She immediately called for Chinese detective Feng Xiushan and Chinese policeman No. 292 to arrest him and detain him at the Laozha Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the previous situation and said that the Public Security Bureau has now brought the case file. Regarding witnesses, in addition to Xu Wan, there is no other evidence. The defendant wrote a very long confession at the police station, explaining that for various reasons, he absolutely could not have killed Xu Jinhui. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau's request for extradition in this case should be handled by the court after investigating the evidence, and so on. Then Gao Wansheng arrived in court and requested extradition. The court then summoned Xu Wan to the case. She stated that she was 42 years old, from Pudong, and the deceased was her son. He and the defendant were friends. On the evening of January 1st of this year, the defendant Qu Guocheng and his cousin came and invited her son out to play. Because Qu often invited Jinhui out to play, spending extravagantly, she refused and did not allow Jinhui to go out. Qu then went back. Unexpectedly, at 8 a.m. on the 2nd, Qu came alone again, inviting Jinhui to go out. At that time, she was not yet awake, so she could not stop him. From then on, Jinhui never returned. When the local court notified her to go and identify the body, the murdered person was indeed her son. Because her son's departure was indeed invited by Qu, she filed a complaint with the Public Security Bureau, and so on. Qu Guocheng confessed that he and the deceased were classmates at the Nanyang Senior Commercial High School. He did not graduate and went to work in the political world. What the plaintiff said was all untrue. Because he had a foreign disease on his neck, he was admitted to Suzhou Guangci Hospital on December 24th of last year for treatment. He only left the hospital on January 6th of this year and came to Shanghai, staying in room 601 of the New New Hotel for about a week. During this period, Xu Wan came to the hotel and met with him, informing him that her son had been killed. She did not do anything to him. Later, he traveled between Guangdong, Shanghai, and Qingdao. When the police came to arrest him, he happened to be in Qingdao. Therefore, the plaintiff's accusation was completely false, and he hired lawyer Ye Fukang to defend him, investigating the plaintiff's previous accusation at the local court's procuratorate against Zhang Xiangguan for killing her son because the evidence was insufficient to prosecute. After the defendant went to the police station for arrest, he immediately surrendered to the local court. Because the investigation did not involve the defendant, he did not surrender. The reason for this accusation was because the loan was not successful, and so on. Qian Hongye, the head of the Criminal Court, reviewed the confession and ordered that the case should not be investigated further. Qu Guocheng was released on bail of 3,000 yuan and ordered to surrender himself to the local court's procuratorate.</p>
<h3>Secret Organization Hiding Large Quantities of Red Pills on Ningbo Ship</h3>
<p>Seized by River Patrol Police Chief</p>
<p>Strictly Arresting the Ship Owner and Others Who Fled</p>
<p>Around 5 p.m. yesterday, Zhang Kefeng, the chief of the Fourth Detachment of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's River Patrol Team, was patrolling the river with police officers Du Wentang, etc. When passing Pudong, they suddenly saw a Ningbo ship named "Jin Wanshun" sailing rapidly from south to north. Because the crew members standing on the ship all looked flustered and suspicious, they immediately ordered the ship to stop. After boarding the ship and conducting an inspection, they found a secret organization built in the ship's cabin, hiding 31 large iron boxes of red pill raw materials, worth a great deal. They detained the ship boss and took him back to the detachment along with the seized drugs, transferring them to the Nanshi General Team. During questioning by Chief Zhu, the ship boss confessed that his name was Chen Er'er, 36 years old, from Haimen. The 31 large iron boxes were entrusted to the ship owner Chen by a customer named Fang at the Baosheng Foreign Company on Haimen Road in this port to be transported to Haimen today. As for the drugs in the boxes, he really did not know about it, and so on. Because the matter concerned the smuggling of prohibited items, in addition to ordering strict arrest of the fleeing ship owner of the "Jin Wanshun" Ningbo ship and Fang from Baosheng Foreign Company, etc., to be investigated, he immediately prepared a document and transferred the obtained witnesses to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Fire in Shenjing Lane, Ningbo Road</h3>
<p>Five-Story Buildings Shared by 28 Families</p>
<p>Houses Completely Burned Down, More Than a Hundred People Escaped</p>
<p>No. 11 Shenjing Lane, 462 Ningbo Road, is a five-story Shikumen building, with the interior being shops, totaling 28, including Yuanyuhang, Xizuji, Zhenyihang, Xinfu Cotton Cloth Store, Xinfenghang, Wangchangji, Dajiqinghang, Jikang Ningzhuang, Hongxing Silk Store, Zhenhuan Silk Weaving Factory, Qianyuanhang, Yongchang Shenghang, Ruixinchanghang, Qiandahang, Wang Fuxinghang, Lao Jiuhehang, Wenfenghang, Qingfenghang, Lixinhang, Tianfenghang, Asia-America Tie Company, Dacheng Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, Hengfenghang, Xinchang Taihang, Cheng Qingxianghang, Yuanji Silk Store, Rui Runyuanhang, etc. In addition to the shop employees, there were also those with family members, so the population was no less than a hundred. Yesterday morning at around 4:20, a fire suddenly broke out in the rear downstairs of the building. Because it was late at night, no one noticed. When they were awakened, the rear staircase had been burned. Therefore, men, women, old, and young all rushed forward to escape. At the same time, the residents in the front also woke up from their dreams and struggled to escape. Unfortunately, there were too many people and the exit was narrow. Therefore, a large number of strong employees jumped down from the upstairs, and the order was in chaos. The fire burned more and more fiercely. Because the building was old, it was easily destroyed, and in a short time, it spread to the entire building and became a fire pit. Fortunately, the Central Fire Brigade had received the alarm and quickly dispatched fire trucks to rescue. It was not completely extinguished until around 7 a.m. yesterday morning, but the building had been completely burned down. The loss was huge. The cause of the fire is unknown. Because the households in the building never cooked, all meals were contracted to nearby restaurants, and the fire started in the rear courtyard, which was empty on all sides, so it was very puzzling. Afterwards, the police sent detectives to investigate and summoned the second landlord of the building for questioning in order to investigate.</p>
<h3>Nanny and Tenant Conspired to Abduct Girl</h3>
<p>Girl Found in Changzhou</p>
<p>Zhang Wu's Testimony is Cunning</p>
<p>Li Shi, the 25-year-old wife of Liu Shaorong, a Macanese employee of the Dalai Bank, who was born in Portugal, lived with her husband at No. 17 Xianyi Lane, New Chongqing Road, Public Concession. Because she had no children, she adopted Zhao's daughter as an adopted daughter two years ago, naming her Aihua. The girl, now 17 years old, suddenly disappeared on August 24th of this year. Li Shi searched everywhere, but there was no news. She reported to the police and requested an investigation. It was not until the 14th of this month that Li Shi received a report from Xing Afu, a servant of her cohabiting woman Zhang Wu, that Aihua was now in Changzhou and that he had personally witnessed her. Li then took a car with Xing overnight to Changzhou and, together with the local Public Security Bureau detectives, arrested the suspects Wu Qiuting and the woman Mu Wanzhen, and seized the abducted girl Aihua, taking them to the Changzhou Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. She learned that the case was actually committed by Li Shi's cohabiting woman Zhang Wu. Li Shi then returned to Shanghai and reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives the day before yesterday to arrest Zhang Wu and her maid Zhang Wu, a native of Changzhou, and detain them at the police station. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the two women to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them according to Articles 257, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law for the crime of enticement, and stated the case, saying that since the two defendants were arrested, Zhang Wu had denied everything at the police station, while Zhang Wu stated that at six or seven o'clock on a certain morning four months ago, Zhang Wu ordered her to send a girl to Changzhou with Wang Songnian. She saw Wang Songnian and a woman at the intersection of Mahe Road and Weihaiwei Road, and they took the train together to Wang Songnian's home in Changzhou, etc. Therefore, Zhang Wu was indeed an accomplice in the case. Now the girl Aihua and the other two criminals Mu Wanzhen and Wu Qiuting are all at the Changzhou Public Security Bureau, and they requested permission to prepare a document to transfer them, and so on. According to Li Shi, Aihua is my adopted daughter, and the defendant Zhang Wu is a tenant who moved in on August 1st of this year. The female criminal Mu Wanzhen arrested by the Changzhou Public Security Bureau is my nanny. The nanny and Zhang Wu are very close on weekdays and talk secretly in the room. Therefore, since Aihua disappeared, I suspected that this matter was related to them, but there was no evidence, so I did not dare to report it rashly. Moreover, the nanny wanted to resign and return to her hometown the day after Aihua disappeared. After I retained her, she returned on August 29th. Now I found Aihua in Changzhou after receiving Xing Afu's confession, and so on. When questioned, Zhang Wu denied the accusation, and her testimony was cunning. Zhang Wu also only claimed that she and Wang Songnian had sent the girl to Changzhou together, and her testimony was vague as to whether Zhang Wu knew about it. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the confessions and ordered the two defendants to be detained and re-examined in seven days.</p>
<h3>Central Vegetable Market Draws Lots Today</h3>
<p>Stalls to Open on New Year's Day</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Trust Society previously ordered by the Municipal Government, in order to prosper the central area of the city, specially built a small vegetable market and more than ten shops at the corner of Minxian Road and Shiguang Road in the central area of the city. They have now been completely completed, and the shops have also been fully leased. The tenants, such as the Central Department Store, are urgently needed in the area. More than 70 stalls have been designated in the vegetable market, and merchants who have registered with the Society in advance have been extremely enthusiastic. Even for the merchants in the nearby townships and towns in the center of the city, they have exceeded the quota by more than double. The Society has politely refused requests from vegetable merchants in other concessions to set up stalls. Now, in order to be fair, the Society has decided to determine the order of the stalls by drawing lots, and it is scheduled to draw lots publicly in the vegetable market at 2 p.m. today. The market will officially open on New Year's Day of the 14th year of the Republic of China, and the Central Department Store will also open at the same time. After this, the residents of the area will find it more convenient for their daily needs of clothing, food, and daily use.</p>
<h3>Municipal Children's Welfare Committee Merges with the China Child Welfare Association</h3>
<p>To Become the Shanghai Local Branch of the China Child Welfare Association</p>
<p>On August 24th of this year, during the sixth semi-annual conference of the Japan-China Child Welfare Association, Pan Gongzhan, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Committee, in order to concentrate the strength of child welfare organizations, represented the committee and proposed to join the Child Welfare Association as the Shanghai Local Branch. On September 7th, Wu Tiecheng, chairman of the association, sent an official letter to the Child Welfare Association, stating that "According to the organizational charter of your association, there are regulations for organizing local branches in various places, and it has been reported that active planning is underway. This committee is the only organization in Shanghai that seeks the welfare of children, and its purpose is the same as that of your association's local branches. In order to concentrate strength, your association in Shanghai does not need to set up another branch. The city may use the municipal committee for the public association's local branch, avoiding one more organization with the same nature and cause, and the results of mutual cooperation can be more efficient. You should review the letter immediately and officially recognize the municipal committee as your association's Shanghai local branch. "Kong Xiangxi, chairman of the Child Welfare Association, after receiving the letter, considered the matter important and specially appointed a five-member committee to study and plan it. At the 69th Executive Committee meeting held a few days ago, they presented their opinions. The committee members present all believed that the Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Committee was well-organized and had outstanding achievements. They welcomed and were glad to hear that they expressed their willingness to join the association for cooperation, and unanimously approved the recognition and ordered the secretariat to reply to Wu, notifying him of the recognition and expressing warm welcome. From now on, the two major child welfare organizations in Shanghai have merged, and their future cooperation is very promising. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Committee has officially joined the Child Welfare Association as the Shanghai Local Branch, but for the convenience of handling affairs, it will continue to use its original name.</p>
<h3>Bank of China to Relocate Regularly</h3>

<h3>Xinhua Bank Launches Small Loans for Factory Workers</h3>
<p>Since the local Xinhua Bank launched small credit loans, people in the industry who need loans have had the opportunity to be accommodated and have been universally praised. Recently, it has been learned that in order to provide opportunities for factory workers to be accommodated, the bank has specially launched credit loans for factory workers at the Yangshupu Road Third Office on a trial basis. The procedures are simpler than the original small credit loans. It is said that the loan amount per household is also smaller, limited to two months' salary of the borrower himself, and not exceeding 100 yuan at most, for a period of up to six months, which can be repaid in monthly installments.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to Rongchangxiang Woolen Suit Shop, upon reading the news section of your newspaper on the 17th of this month, which contained a news item titled "Fighting Over Porridge and Side Dishes, Fatal Stab with Scissors," the content stated "Rongchangxiang Suit Shop," which is quite surprising. After investigation, this shop has not experienced any such incident. Therefore, a person was sent to investigate the address, and it was found that the shop's name is not Rongchangxiang but Rongzhangxiang. This clearly indicates that your newspaper's investigation was inaccurate. As our shop's reputation is at stake, we request that you publish a letter of correction. Therefore, we are sending this letter on their behalf, hoping that you will immediately publish the original letter in the letter column to correct the matter. Sincerely, Attorney Yu Hualong, December 17th.</p>

<h3>Sixteen or Seventeen Year Old Boy Turns Out to Be an Extortionist</h3>
<p>Mailing Letters No Less Than Four Times</p>
<p>Claiming to be Driven by Desperation</p>
<p>Chen Zhongxiao, 48 years old, from Shaoxing, owner of Chen Xinda Dyeing and Indigo Shop at No. 35, Xichang Lane, Daxing Street, outside Xiaoximen, Nanshi, has some savings and was targeted by bandits. Suddenly, on the 7th of this month, he received a threatening letter demanding 200 yuan, instructing him to send someone to the Xian Shi Company Cinema between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM on the 10th of this month, with the person holding a newspaper in their hand. If the money was not sent, they would face danger on the street, and someone would be there to meet them at the cinema. As Chen Zhongxiao was not at home, having gone to Shaoxing for business, he received another letter a day later, stating to quickly send someone to the bottom of the middle chair in the ninth row outside the Daxingban Theater at Xian Shi Company, wrapping the money in straw paper with a torn Shen Bao newspaper as a marker on top. This money was to be sent by the 12th of this month, between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM. Unexpectedly, the next day, he received a third threatening letter, stating that the previous two letters should have been received, but there was no news of the money. Therefore, they were again instructing him to pay attention to the bottom of the chair in the fifth seat of the 26th row on the right side of the Daxingban Theater at Xian Shi Company, following the same instructions as the second letter. If the money was not sent again, Mr. Chen was advised to be careful, signed by Wu Tianxiong. At this time, Chen Zhongxiao had returned home from Shaoxing and learned about the three threatening letters. Therefore, he immediately reported the above situation to the Ximen Branch Bureau, requesting an investigation. Director Li immediately dispatched the Detective Team leader Shen Wenda, Deputy Leader Fang Linggen, detectives Bian Wenguang, Jiao Baojun, and others to go in disguise, along with the relevant constables, Western Detective, and Chinese Detective Leader Li Shugui, to wait at the Daxingban Theater at Xian Shi Company. When the time came, no bandit appeared to make contact. Therefore, the detectives returned to the bureau to report. Unexpectedly, the bandit sent a fourth extortion letter the day before, stating, "Respected Boss Zhongxiao, the previous four letters should have been received, but there is no news of the 200 yuan. We are now instructing you to send the money to the Huangjin Cinema at the Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession, wrapping the money in straw paper with red paper as a marker on top. This money is to be sent by the 17th." At that time, Chen Zhongxiao presented the fourth extortion letter he received to the bureau for investigation. Therefore, Director Li again ordered Detective Team Leader Shen Wenda to lead Deputy Leader Fang Linggen, Bian Wenguang, and others to go with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession police to wait at the Huangjin Cinema at 11:00 AM yesterday. Detective Fang Linggen disguised himself as the contact person, using straw paper wrapped with red paper as a marker. Before long, a boy of about sixteen or seventeen years old came to make contact and was arrested and taken to the bureau. After questioning, he confessed to being Tang Liangmao, 16 years old, from Shaoxing, living in a small inn with no fixed address, previously an apprentice at the Xie Kang Paint Shop, but he stole 100 yuan and ran away, spending it all. Now, he is trapped in the inn with financial difficulties and was forced to write the threatening letters in the inn. After questioning by Director Li, he prepared a document to submit to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Major Fraud Case of Opening Gambling Dens in the French Concession Concluded</h3>
<p>Each Defendant's Situation at the Time Was Questioned Separately Yesterday</p>
<p>Concluding Arguments Announced, Judgment to be Delivered on the 19th</p>
<p>Deputy Director of the French Police Department Raoboze (transliteration) received a confidential report in late November, stating that someone was spreading rumors that the current French Consul General Mei Liai was taking leave to return to his country, and the new Consul General would reinstate the Concession's market and allow the opening of five gambling dens within the Concession, soliciting "motion fees" under the pretense of applying for permits. The French Police Department immediately dispatched translators Jiang Futian and Li Xianyang from the Gambling Arrest Team, disguised as capitalists, to conduct negotiations with the fraudsters in Room 202 of the Dadongxin Hotel on Xixinqiao Street on November 30. On December 1st, they continued negotiations in Room 301 of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjiamuqiao Street. After both parties signed a contract, the fraudsters Yang Yingchu, Wang Baiqing, Zhu Zhenhua, Cai Baoshan, Pan Shucan, Yang Dingguo, and suspects Fu Fengshan and Pi Xichun, a total of eight people, were arrested on the spot. Documents and contracts related to the organization of illegal societies were seized from Yang Yingchu and Cai Baoshan's homes, and they were transferred to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. On December 13th, Judge Sun Pengxian conducted a preliminary hearing. The police prosecuted Yang Yingchu and Cai Baoshan for fraud as a habitual offense under Article 368 of the Criminal Code, and the remaining defendants for fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code. After a brief interrogation by Judge Sun, he ruled that the two defendants, Yang Yingchu and Cai Baoshan, should be under the jurisdiction of the Local Court and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<p>Transferring the Case to the Local Court for Trial, the details of which have been reported previously. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Zhang Chaozuo, accompanied by Clerk Zheng Rong, specially opened the First Criminal Court for the hearing. They first asked each defendant for their name, age, place of origin, address, and occupation. Then, Police Attorney Yao stated the facts of the case (the wording of which was the same as recorded in previous reports). The judge then took the second to eighth defendants down for separate interrogation. Yang Yingchu testified that a month ago, a friend named Han told him that the French Consul was returning to his country and that the new Consul would reinstate gambling dens, and that he could find a way to do so. In mid-November, Wang Baiqing came to ask him and Yang Dingguo and Zhu Zhenhua to go to Cai Baoshan's house, saying that there were capitalists who asked him to find a way</p>
<p>to obtain permits. He told them that according to previous information, there were five permits, two of which had already been taken, and only three were available. On the 30th, Wang came to him again, saying that the capitalists wanted to meet him. He then went with them to a Cantonese restaurant across from Xian Shi on Damalu to discuss the matter. He heard that the capitalists could invest 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. On December 1st, at 5:00 PM, Wang Baiqing, Zhu Zhenhua, and Cai Baoshan came to call him again, saying that the capitalists wanted to meet him in person. They then went to Room 634 of the Wu Gong Hotel, where they saw Pan Shuxie, who said that Yin Dong had booked Room 301 of the Dafang Hotel and that they would go to negotiate first and then call him over. At around 6:00 PM, they called him to go to the Dafang Hotel, where he met Mr. Hong from Yin Dong (the disguised translator), who said that there was capital</p>
<p>of 500,000 yuan. He said that it could only be done if it was real. They said that preparations were complete and asked him to sign a contract, which Yang Dingguo drafted. After it was written, they were arrested. At the police station, they said he was a fraud, but he did not receive a single penny. He just wanted to find something to do after it was successful. Wang Baiqing testified that he met Yang Yingchu last year. This time, around the 20th of last month, Yang told him that gambling dens could be opened in the French Concession, and each permit would cost 45,000 yuan in official fees, asking him to find capitalists, saying that it was best to have 1 million yuan in capital, or at least 500,000 yuan, and that there were a total of five permits, two of which had already been taken, and there were still three left. On the 25th, he met Cai Baoshan and told him what Yang Yingchu had said, hoping to</p>
<p>work as a waiter after it was done. Zhu Zhenhua testified that he did not know Yang Yingchu or Wang Baiqing and only knew Cai Baoshan. On the afternoon of the 26th of last month, at 2:00 PM, he went to Cai's house to ask if there was any construction work. At that time, he heard that there were three club permits in the French Concession and asked him to introduce Yin Dong. The next day, he found Yang Guoding and went to Cai's house to ask. Cai said that the matter was real and that each permit would cost 45,000 yuan, half to be paid ten days after opening and the other half ten days later. On the 29th, he went to Cai's house again and saw Wang Baiqing. Wang said that they were waiting for Yang Dingguo and Yang Yingchu to arrive. Later, Yang and the others arrived, saying that they had to hurry up, or they would have to renegotiate after the 30th. Yang Yingchu also said that he wanted to copy the bank's deposit</p>
<p>account name and number and submit it to the authorities for approval, then find a place and issue a permit, and after it was done, assign him to take care of everything in the place. Yang Dingguo testified that Zhu Zhenhua was running a construction business at his place. On the night of the 26th of last month, Zhu came back and talked about the opening of the gambling den. He didn't want to miss the opportunity to find some construction work, so he found Pan Shucan to discuss the matter. On the 29th, he met Yang Yingchu, who was fully responsible. On the afternoon of the 30th, he received a phone call asking him to go to the Tiantian Restaurant on Sichuan Road to discuss the matter. Cai Baoshan testified that Wang Baiqing introduced him, saying that gambling dens could be opened in the French Concession and asking if he had Yin Dong. He replied that he would find one. The next day, Zhu Zhenhua came and said that there were three gambling tables, each costing 45,000 yuan, and</p>
<p>proceeded with the negotiations, hoping to be assigned some tasks after it was done. Pan Shucan testified that he only knew Yang Dingguo among the eight people and did not know anything about the police report of gambling den fraud. Yang Dingguo called him over and said that gambling tables could be opened in the French Concession, asking if he had any capitalists. He then introduced Pan Jihua, hoping to attract red-light business after it was successful. Fu Fengshan and Shen Xichun testified that they did not know the details of this case. They were called to the Dafang Hotel and were arrested. After hearing the testimony, the judge ordered translators Jiang and Li to report the process of disguised negotiation and then presented various pieces of evidence. After the court examined each one in detail, it ordered the commencement of arguments. Police Attorney Yao and the lawyers hired by the defendants argued with each other. The court then announced the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 19th. Defendants Fu Fengshan and Shen Xichun were each released on 500 yuan bail pending further instructions, and the rest were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: A Poor Girl Cannot Be Ashamed to Teach; Seeing Poverty in the West Is Not Enough to Induce Empty Humiliation</p>
<p>Auntie Hu said, "What kind of talk is this? Mr. Jia is asking you a question seriously, and you're answering him like that?" Jia Duocai waved his hand and laughed, "It's alright, it's alright, she's just shy, it's not that she's ignoring me. Coincidentally, I love it when girls are shy, you just be shy for a little while longer." Saying that, he laughed heartily. After laughing, he took out a flat cigarette case from his pocket. When Yueying stole a glance, she saw that the case was gleaming white, which was quite strange. Auntie Hu said, "Mr. Jia, is this case made of silver? How much does it weigh?" Jia Duocai said, "A little over one tael." Auntie Hu said, "Girl, listen to that, even his cigarette case is made of silver. One tael of silver is enough for me to eat for three months." Jia Duocai laughed, "If you compare it like that, what else can you say. Going east, it's very common to have a cigarette case made of gold." Although Yueying had heard her grandmother say how fortunate they were in their original hometown of Hunan, she had never heard of silver cigarette cases. She didn't expect to see one in person today. Because she was thinking this way, she couldn't help but raise her head slightly to look at Jia Duocai's hand. Jia Duocai was holding a cigarette in his hand, tapping it on the case, his eyes fixed on Yueying's face. When Yueying raised her head, their eyes met. Yueying immediately smiled and lowered her head. Jia Duocai then pinched the cigarette between his fingers and brought it to her, laughing, "Won't you have a cigarette?" Yueying raised her arm, blocking Jia Duocai's hand, and shook her head slightly. Auntie Hu said, "Silly child, silly child, even if you don't smoke, you should stand up and take it. Isn't this too impolite? Stand up, stand up." Yueying also felt that this gentleman was truly wealthy. If she sold herself to him, her whole family would survive. She should be more polite to this person and not offend him. (92)</p>
<h3>A Sketch of the Reading Room</h3>
<p>— Ji Jue</p>
<p>The university reading room is truly extraordinary. Whether observing it in terms of form or reality, it changes rapidly within the ten hours of the morning, noon, and evening, giving a sense of profound vicissitudes. As usual, the day's newspapers are delivered to the university, quickly distributed by the post office, and then distributed by the library for display in the reading room. After several turns, it is already past 9:00 AM. "Newspapers are the spiritual food of life." University students' love for this necessity is perhaps even more profound. Therefore, before the newspapers arrive, a group of people are already waiting in front of the reading room door, or even impatiently walking into the empty room, pacing back and forth. As soon as the library staff brings the newspapers and clips them in place, everyone rushes forward, each heading towards the newspapers they like, reading attentively, without any other movements. This can be considered a fleeting moment of the golden age of the university reading room!</p>
<p>A school community of over a thousand people is complex not only in form; each person's psychology, each person's preferences, and even each person's actions all exhibit great differences, creating countless variations. The changes in the reading room under these diverse conditions are only natural. Less than an hour after the newspapers are displayed, many gaps are found, and certain supplements have disappeared without a trace. That is the beginning of stealing newspapers. Friends who love literature target the supplements, those who pay attention to international issues and national affairs target the current affairs commentary and international news, and friends who love movies target the movie supplements... Each chooses what they like and takes it separately. Even "aspiring journalists" who study journalism clip out even the slightly more outstanding headlines.</p>
<p>Time passes, scene after scene, from morning to noon to evening. By 9:00 PM, the edible parts of the dozen or so newspapers in the reading room have all been taken, leaving only some unpalatable "chicken ribs," like incomplete corpses displayed on a battlefield, left for the library staff to do the "corpse collection" work.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yao Kuangsheng)</p>
<p>On the road of life, the more twists and turns, the more flavorful it feels. If everything goes smoothly, it is not enough to display one's creative ability; the beauty of genius; a person who has not experienced hardship, how can they know the joy of joy? Living in a comfortable nest, one does not know one is blessed; it is like Pigsy eating ginseng fruit, eating without knowing the taste; it is like an ancient painting given to a farmer; a beauty given to a bandit; having a treasure, how can they appreciate and enjoy it; the life of such a person is missed, which is truly a pity.</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After such a pilgrimage, not only was the Empress Dowager's heart extremely sorrowful, but even those of us with shallower relationships felt infinite sadness. Although people cannot escape death, their belongings often evoke endless sorrow in those who come after, which is truly an unpleasant thing!</p>
<p>After returning to her private hall, the Empress Dowager sat quietly to rest. The gloomy impression she had just felt was still lingering in her mind. We all withdrew, leaving only a female official on duty to attend to her.</p>
<p>I was also among those who withdrew to rest, but my body had not really been that active, so I did not feel tired at all. I only felt unusually bored in my chest and really wanted to relax for a while; unexpectedly, Guangxu added another layer of boredom to me. When he saw that no one nearby was paying attention, he suddenly whispered to me:</p>
<p>"I can guarantee you! In these old palaces, there will never be anything to commemorate me stored, no matter when!" As he spoke, he let out a bitter laugh that was even uglier than crying. "What do I have now? What thing can be said to belong to me? There will be even less in the future!"</p>
<p>After speaking, he covered his face and walked away softly.</p>
<p>Originally, the sky was still bright with sunshine, but now it was like being covered by a heavy cloud, and all that could be seen was darkness, sorrow, and gloom. (202)</p>
<h3>Be Careful of Fire</h3>
<p>Zhang Yuqing</p>
<p>The wheel of climate is constantly rotating, advancing into the winter season! The misty surroundings are only quiet and desolate. The mercury tube on the thermometer has shrunk to the lowest level, as if unable to breathe. The wind of December, the rain and snow at the end of the season, seem to be made specifically to invade the group of poor people.</p>
<p>Indeed, the weather is gradually getting colder, day by day, so cold that ordinary poor people are losing their lives, and even wearing tattered cotton clothes they are still shivering. However, noble people who do not come into contact with the air do not feel that the weather has turned cold. Perhaps because this year's hot summer was extraordinarily hot, exceeding the heat of the past sixty years, the beggars who borrowed the lower floors of the overhanging buildings as hotels were cursing God, why must there be winter on the wheel of the seasonal cycle!</p>
<p>"Cold winter months, be careful of fire," a few senior members of their group, thinking of this perennial business, returned to the sweet joy.</p>
<p>Indeed, this kind of business with no capital is truly worth doing. It does not cost money or effort, just circle around a few times at dusk when it is quiet, shouting "Cold winter months, be careful of fire." After a few days, they can go door-to-door to ask for money, and at that time, ordinary families who are unwilling to give alms will also break some money. Of course, having fulfilled the obligation, they should enjoy the rights.</p>
<p>From this, we must associate that if a person lives in society and wants to maintain their pitiful life, how difficult it is! Not only must they have a sharp mind and agile thoughts, but they must also have a considerable history and status! Furthermore, they must meet the needs of others.</p>

<h3>The Story of the Little Coppersmith's Load</h3>
<p>— Drunken Chi Sheng</p>
<p>The other day, Qing Quyu wrote in this publication about the gold wonton load, mentioning the Chen family of Sipailou in this city, who used to work as coppersmiths. Later, they became wealthy, and their descendants specially made a small coppersmith's load to be placed in the ancestral hall as a souvenir. As for the reason for their wealth, he omitted the details. I have a friendly relationship with the Cheng family, so I know it more clearly, so now I might as well talk about it.</p>
<p>The Cheng family's address is not Sipailou, but actually ××pailou. The house is large, with several rooms, all inhabited by the clan. Their ancestor, Cheng, was a coppersmith. He was diligent and thrifty. One day, carrying his coppersmith's load, he passed the door of a dilapidated household. That family had a few copper square bricks in the hall that they wanted to sell to him. He offered a very cheap price and exchanged them. When he returned home and looked carefully, they were actually all brilliant gold. He made this windfall, which was truly a joy from heaven. At this time, land was also cheap, so he acquired a lot of property. For a time, there was "Cheng half the city, Zhu a corner": this means that the Cheng family's property was more than the Zhu family's. However, by now, these two sentences are no longer relevant. Later, the descendants specially made a small coppersmith's load to commemorate their ancestors, which is still displayed on the gatehouse today.</p>
<p>World News</p>
<h3>European and American Pawn Industry</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhengping</p>
<p>European and American pawn industries can be broadly divided into three types: one adopts private ownership, such as England and the United States; the second adopts public ownership, such as France, Belgium, and Italy; and the third adopts a combination of public and private ownership, such as Germany, Austria, and Sweden. Here is a brief description of each:</p>
<p>(1) England</p>
<p>Private pawnshops in England are supervised by municipal and village self-governing bodies and must obtain a license from the Inland Revenue Office, paying an annual license fee of seven pounds and ten shillings. The interest rates charged range from 4% to 8% per annum, plus a handling fee of half a penny to one penny. The redemption period is one year plus seven days. After the expiration date, the pawnshop owns goods worth half a pound or less. Goods worth more than half a pound must be sold by auction. The borrower can still redeem the item during the period between the expiration date and the auction. If the auction price exceeds the principal and interest, the surplus should be returned to the borrower. However, within one year, if a borrower's pawned goods are sold at a loss, the loss can be compensated for from the surplus profit. The pawnshop is responsible for compensating for losses due to fire or negligence.</p>
<p>(2) United States</p>
<p>The pawn industry in the United States is supervised by the state governments, and the methods vary considerably. Generally, a fee must be paid and a license obtained before opening a pawnshop, and a guarantee must be provided. Interest rates are roughly divided into two types: one is based on the amount of the loan, and the other has a uniform standard regardless of the amount of the loan. For the uniform rate, the monthly interest rate ranges from 1% to 8%, with New Mexico being the lowest and Delaware being the highest. For the rate based on the loan amount, New York is the most well-known, divided into two categories: less than and more than US$100. For the former, the monthly interest rate is 3% for the first six months and 2% thereafter; for the latter, the monthly interest rate is 2% for the first six months and 1% thereafter. Other states, such as Maine and Virginia, also charge interest based on the loan amount. In addition to interest, handling fees are also charged for specific items. The redemption period also varies; some are explicitly stipulated, while others are agreed upon by both parties. The surplus from the sale of unredeemed goods must also be returned to the borrower. If the borrower does not request a refund, it is generally confiscated by the government. Pawnshops are responsible for compensating all or part of the loss due to fire damage, and some must take out insurance in advance to prevent unforeseen circumstances. In addition, charitable organizations establishing pawnshops are quite developed in the United States. They are specifically permitted by the state government to be exempt from business tax, which is also a form of encouragement.</p>
<p>(3) France</p>
<p>Public pawnshops in France originated in the early 19th century and were formally established by law in 1851. Private pawnshops were generally prohibited. The Law on Public Pawnshops in France was promulgated in that year and is still effective today. Public pawnshops have a board of directors, with the mayor of the town serving as the chairman. The directors are honorary positions appointed by the mayor of the city or county, and one-third are replaced each year. The interest rate on pawned goods is 3% to 7% per annum. The redemption period is generally one year. The surplus from unredeemed goods should be returned to the bearer. If the bearer does not request it, it must be retained for three years before it can be confiscated as part of the remaining property. In the event of a loss, the authorities are responsible for compensating one-third of the value of the pledged goods.</p>
<p>(4) Belgium</p>
<p>After 1848, all public pawnshops in Belgium were managed by the municipalities. The directors of the bureau are appointed by the mayor of the town or village. The operating capital is mostly contributed by the citizens. The interest rate on pawned goods is limited to 15% per annum, with a redemption period of one year. However, unredeemed goods must be sold thirteen months after the expiration date. The borrower can still redeem the item one day before the sale. For the sale of goods, 5% is charged to cover interest and handling fees. If there is a surplus, it must be returned to the borrower. Except for force majeure, losses of pledged goods are compensated by the authorities, plus half of the amount as compensation.</p>
<p>(5) Italy</p>
<p>Italy is the earliest country to have public pawnshops, and other countries have strived to emulate it. The capital of public pawnshops mostly comes from donations. The monthly interest rate is 5% to 7%; no interest is charged for goods worth less than five lire. The redemption period is six months, but the method can be changed to extend it to five years. Unredeemed goods can be sold two weeks after the expiration date. If there is a surplus, it must be returned to the borrower. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Strength Insufficient, Yunfei Loses to Western Youth</h3>
<p>Clever Tactics, Three Times in the Lead</p>
<p>Result: 63 to 38 Defeat</p>
<p>Tonight, Jiangwan Fights Mailing</p>
<p>Although Yunfei lost to Western Youth 38-63 in basketball last night, the first ten minutes of the first half were surprisingly tense. Yunfei led Western Youth three times, 5-2, 11-9, and 15-14, which surprised the Western Youth players. However, due to insufficient strength, they could not maintain this situation. Western Youth scored 20 consecutive points, making the first half 34-15, and the final score was 63-38. Yunfei's strategy last night was to use low-ball passing with agile movements, making the Western Youth's tall player Ryan completely useless. Carlson and Squires are the two most dangerous players for Western Youth, and their victory depended entirely on them. Yunfei's three forwards played unexpectedly well, working hard in unison. It is a pity that they lacked strength, and once the momentum slowed down, the opponent took advantage. The next match against Mailing may be worth watching. In another match, St. John's defeated Qingguang 34-31.</p>

<h3>Huadong Girls' Middle School Basketball Team Achieves Three Victories in Three Matches in Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Huadong Girls' Middle School basketball team, in order to improve their skills, went to Songjiang led by instructors Hu Zongpan and Wang Ziyun at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday (December 16th). At 10:00 AM, they played against the Seven County Women's Normal School at the Public Sports Field. Many people came to watch, and the place was very crowded.

Both sides were evenly matched, and there were many exciting moments. In the first half, Huadong took the lead 6-5 by one point. After the break, the Songjiang Provincial Girls' Middle School had a tight defense and tried hard to counterattack, showing a trend of catching up. However, it was only a flash in the pan, and Huadong scored several more points, pushing the score up sharply. However, because Huadong had played several matches in a row, all the athletes felt tired, while the Songjiang Provincial Girls' Middle School was well-rested and took advantage of the opportunity to attack. However, due to their inferior technique, they still lost to Huadong 14-18. The team returned triumphantly by overnight express train that evening.</p>

After the match, the team was warmly received and treated to refreshments and snacks.</p>

<h3>Chinese Social Education Society Agrees on Curriculum Standards for People's Schools</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, December 17th) The Chinese Social Education Society believes that there are many people's schools throughout the country, and it is urgent to formulate curriculum standards for people's schools and publicize them throughout the country to meet the needs. They appointed Zhong Lingxiu, Gan Daobo, Yang Xiaochun, Feng Shaowu, Feng Guohua, Zhao Jiliang, Du Liangjie, and other seven people to draft them, and submitted them to the Board of Directors for referral to the General Assembly for resolution. They requested Zhong Lingxiu to convene the original drafters to a meeting. The original drafters decided to hold a meeting at the Ministry of Education on the 16th and 17th. Gan Daobo, Ma Shaowu, and Feng Guohua rushed from Wuxi. Chairman Zhong Lingxiu completely agreed on all the curriculum standards for people's schools, including Chinese, Arithmetic, Music, and Physical Education, and will submit them to the Chinese Social Education Society for submission to the Ministry of Education for approval and promulgation.</p>
<h3>Simple Normal and Special Teacher Courses May Be Temporarily Exempt from the Joint Examination</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Education announced the regulations for the joint examination of normal schools, normal schools must participate in the joint examination this year. However, due to special difficulties and the simplicity of normal schools, they petitioned the Ministry of Education to review and approve the regulations. Those who followed the principles could make appropriate changes or postpone the joint examination. A few days ago, the Ministry of Education approved the postponement of the Shanghai Municipal Normal School Joint Examination. In the past two days, it also instructed the Hebei Education Department to handle the relief measures as proposed because the difficulties in the county normal school joint examinations stated in its report were indeed true. Yesterday, it telegraphed to the Jiangxi Provincial Government, stating that graduating students of the one-year simple normal course and the special normal course may be temporarily exempted from the joint examination.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Commissioners Inspect Education in Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi Provinces: Recent News</h3>
<p>Have Inspected Eight Higher and Vocational Education Schools</p>
<p>Can Complete the Work and Return to Beijing in Mid-December</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent commissioners Sun Guofeng and Supervisor Dai Xia to inspect higher education and vocational schools in Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces (and separately invited Shanghai doctor Pang Jingzhou to inspect medicine. Pang had work to do and only inspected Guangzhou and other places, so he visited fewer places and had a shorter inspection time). Sun and Dai went to Shanghai in mid-November to wait for the ship to depart. Recently, a friend in Beijing received a letter from Sun, the gist of which was: "Arrived in Xiamen on November 24th and inspected the area. Arrived in Fuzhou on the 30th for a week of inspection. Returned to Xiamen on the 7th of this month and went to Hong Kong on the 8th. A total of four higher education schools and four vocational schools have been inspected. During this trip to Fuzhou, I encountered storms, and the small boat in Majiang also caught a cold, causing me to be sick for three days. Still, I insisted on inspecting, daring not to rest. It is expected that the work can be completed around the middle of next month."</p>
<h3>University of Hong Kong Awards Honorary Doctorate to Hu Shih</h3>

<h3>Chinese Ethnological Society Established</h3>
<p>Researching Chinese Ethnic Groups and Their Cultures</p>
<p>(Nanjing Communication) Academic circles Cai Yuanpei, Huang Wenshan, Ling Chunsheng, Sun Benwen, He Liankui, Xu Yitang, Yang Kun, Wu Dingliang, Chen Yinghuang, Shang Chengzu, Liu Xianou, Tang Zhu, Hu Huanyong, etc., in view of the fact that domestic academic movements in recent years, although booming, have not yet organized research on our country's ethnic groups and their cultures to meet the requirements of collective thinking and exploration, therefore, half a year ago, they organized the Chinese Ethnological Society. At that time, comrades from all over the country, upon hearing this news, were willing to participate. Now, the Society held its inaugural meeting at Central University in Nanjing at 8:00 AM on the 16th of this month. Members from all over the country who went to attend included Huang Wenshan, Hu Jianmin, Shang Chengzu, Qiu Changkang, Sun Benwen, Xu Yitang, He Liankui, Ouyang Zhu, Cheng Jing, Hu Huanyong, Wu Wenhui, Ma Songling, Rui Yifu, Luo Xianglin, and dozens of others.

Sun Benwen was publicly elected as chairman, and Ma Songling was elected as recorder. The purpose of organizing the Society was announced, followed by He Liankui reporting on the preparations. Then, the attendees gave speeches on their daily research experiences. Finally, various rules and regulations were passed, and supervisors and directors were elected. Those elected were Cai Yuanpei, Huang Wenshan, He Liankui, Ling Chunsheng, Xu Yitang, Shang Chengzu, Sun Benwen, Qiu Changkang, Hu Jianmin, Cheng Jing, and other nine people. The meeting adjourned at twelve o'clock.</p>
<h3>Number of Students Studying in Japan Increases Sharply, Many Did Not Go Through the Procedures Set by the Ministry</h3>
<p>Qualifications and Economy Are Currently Serious Problems</p>
<p>Zhou Xianwen Discussed Alternative Methods with the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Japan-China Academic Association, the total number of Chinese students studying in Japan this year is more than 2,300, which is double the number last year. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency inquired about the reasons for the sharp increase from the Universal Student Association in this city yesterday, as well as the situation where the procedures for going abroad did not comply with the regulations set by the Ministry, as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Sharp Increase in the Number of Students Studying in Japan The reason for the sharp increase in the number of students studying in Japan is the depreciation of the Japanese yen. Before 1922 and 1923, each Japanese yen was worth more than two yuan in national currency, but now each Japanese yen is only worth more than eighty cents in national currency, a big difference. Generally poorer students in our country believe that this is a great opportunity, so they go to Japan one after another to pursue further studies. Among the more than 2,000 students who went to Japan this year, most entered Waseda University and Meiji University. The subjects they study are mostly social sciences.</p>
<p>Departure Procedures Not in Accordance with Ministry Regulations The procedures originally set by the Ministry of Education for students studying in Japan required graduation from a school above the specialized level and a deposit of two years' worth of expenses in the Bank of Communications. A certificate must be issued by the bank before a study abroad certificate can be obtained. Among the students studying in Japan this year, many did not meet the Ministry of Education's regulations in terms of qualifications and economy. Therefore, most did not go through the procedures set by the Ministry for going abroad, and often went directly to Japan. This is currently a serious problem. Zhou Xianwen, the supervisor of students studying in Japan, previously returned to China to discuss alternative methods with the Ministry of Education, but it has not yet been resolved.</p>

<h3>Newcomers to the Japanese Literary Scene in 1934</h3>
<p>— Fan Hai</p>
<p>The newcomers who have emerged in the Japanese literary scene this year include Kenkichi Shimaki, Koroku Hirata, Kazuo Sasaki, Hiroshi Aso, Shoichi Hashimoto, Kazuo Shimada, Maki Fujishima, Rokuro Kusakari, Naoe Sugiyama, Yang Kui, Seiji Kimura, Shigeko Shoji, etc.</p>
<p>Among these newcomers, the most successful are Kenkichi Shimaki and Koroku Hirata. Kenkichi Shimaki's "Prison" can be said to be the most important work of the Japanese literary scene in 1934. As soon as he emerged, he immediately received great praise in the Japanese literary scene. The other five articles attached to "Prison," "Leprosy," "Blindness," "Depression," "Falling," and "Doctor," are all model descriptions of prison life. Therefore, Kenkichi Shimaki can be said to be the first famous newcomer in the Japanese literary scene this year.</p>
<p>Standing alongside Kenkichi Shimaki to become the two pillars of the Japanese literary scene this year is Koroku Hirata. He is the only representative of Japanese peasant literature in 1934. Originally, the bankruptcy of Japanese villages had fallen into an extremely tragic situation. Therefore, this year's Japanese literary scene was almost entirely filled with articles describing rural villages, and peasant literature was almost the main aspect of Japanese literature in 1934, and the most outstanding of peasant literature was Koroku Hirata.</p>
<p>Kazuo Sasaki is the farmer among the farmer writers. His "After the Fall" is undeniably the healthiest work. He himself is from a rural village. He breathes in the soil, fertilizer, and sweat, and writes heavy but simple and clear works by farmers themselves.</p>
<p>Hiroshi Aso co-authored "Boy" with Hayashi Fusao. The so-called co-authoring is rare in literary circles in various countries, and this is also worth commemorating in the Japanese literary scene this year.</p>
<p>Kazuo Shimada published a work entitled "Dung Street." The protagonist is the secretary of a free labor union, said to be the author himself. He wrote this work with considerable ambition.</p>
<p>Maki Fujishima, also translated as Maki Fujishima, is obviously a woman's name. She published "Life" and "Red Peeling." It is rare to see women who use such thick lines to describe their works.</p>
<p>There is another special phenomenon in the Japanese literary scene this year besides peasant literature, and that is literature describing colonies. In Japan, there has always been literature describing colonies, but the meaning of works written by the colonists themselves has only gained a deeper meaning this year. Here, Yang Kui and Rokuro Kusakari are representative writers. Yang Kui describes Taiwanese farmers, and Rokuro Kusakari describes Korean laborers. These two writers who describe the lower classes of Japanese colonies will give the Korean writer Jang Hyuk-ju, who is gradually moving towards describing the petit bourgeois life, a stronger intention, right?</p>
<p>Finally, Naoe Sugiyama is also a female writer. She is also a female worker in a cotton yarn factory. At a time when the Japanese literary scene this year is full of literature describing farmers, there is almost only one writer who describes factory laborers, Naoe Sugiyama. Therefore, Naoe Sugiyama is also a special force in the Japanese literary scene this year. Her description of the working conditions in the factory is so clear, varied, and non-repetitive that it is truly commendable. Up to now, there are not many writers who come from laborers who can describe the working conditions in the factory as accurately as she does, and report the ordinary and interesting one day in the factory without special accidents. Not only are there no traces of conceptual political doctrine in her works, but also no sentimentality and emotional excitement, which are unique to female writers. Among the newcomers, this writer is one of the most promising.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Night Market</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>Before I went to Tokyo, I had heard about how lively the Tokyo night market was. After arriving in Tokyo, I went to see it myself and felt that it was still "worthy of the name." However, I have not been to Tokyo for many days, so I have only visited the night market three times. The first two times, I just "looked at the flowers on horseback" with Lao Yu and came back after a while. The third time, I visited with Lanbao, Yaoman, etc. for a long time, and I also bought a little something. There are night markets in every lively place in Tokyo, such as Asakusa, Ginza, Shinjuku, etc. I am only talking about the night market in Shinjuku here.</p>
<p>I remember that on a Saturday evening the week before, after dinner, our group took the train from Higashi-Nakano Station with excited emotions and ran towards our destination. Probably because it was a Saturday night, the carriages were more crowded with people than usual. The train arrived at Shinjuku after two stops. People felt different when they walked out of the station. Everywhere there were red lights, green lights, purple lights, and incandescent lights, flashing, flying, and jumping. Cars were walking in formation on the road like black ants. The pedestrians on both sides of the sidewalk squeezed me and I squeezed you. It was really what they called "watertight."</p>
<p>The sides of the road are filled with many small stalls. Each small stall has a cloth awning, selling daily necessities and children's toys, etc. There are also cheap second-hand books, oil paintings, and picture cards, etc. We stopped in front of an oil painting stall.</p>
<p>"Buy a few oil paintings!" Lanbao said, and after saying that, she squatted down and flipped through them one by one.</p>
<p>I saw that the price was cheap and the oil paintings were good, so I bought four, and Lanbao bought two. One of the ones I bought was of three children. Lanbao said it was very good to wash their feet by the creek, so I gave it to her.</p>
<p>We walked slowly, looking at all kinds of things. It was really like the commander-in-chief reviewing the troops. Suddenly we saw a beggar sitting on the roadside. Yao said, "There is a beggar here!" She said with a bit of a rare tone. Really, we only saw this beggar after we arrived in Tokyo. Moreover, he was disabled. Although there are tens of thousands of poor people in Japan, there are very few beggars. Compared with Shanghai, Shanghai is too ashamed!</p>
<p>As we walked, we bought many fun things. Lanbao bought a little foreign doll. She said with a smile, "There is already a foreign doll in my house. I am afraid she is lonely, so I bought this one to accompany her!" This sentence made Fatty Sister laugh so hard that her eyes were like black lines.</p>
<p>Walking, walking, walking many roads, we also went to big companies, and we also went to the basement. We didn't return until around nine o'clock.</p>
<p>"The Tokyo night market is lively and charming!" I am thinking this now.</p>
<h3>"Watching Cars"</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Cowpox and Anesthesia</h3>
<p>— Qiao Feng</p>
<p>Before mankind had writing or historical records, they had already discovered and invented many useful things and methods, such as the use of fire, the method of making fire, tools, and many things such as medicinal materials for treating diseases. If they were all written down one by one, the list would be very long. After there was written history, things that were beneficial to mankind were discovered one after another, and new tools were invented at any time. The method of vaccinating against cowpox and anesthesia are just two of the many in the middle, but their benefits are great. There is a reason to bring them up here to talk about them.</p>
<p>In recent days, I have seen papers posted on the road or in cars calling on people to get vaccinated against cowpox, which shows that smallpox is coming again. Smallpox is a contagious disease, and it is a life-threatening disease. It is widespread and the number of deaths is extremely high. It often becomes popular every spring; it is dangerous for children to be infected, and even if they are not infected, it is still a worrying thing; because people who have not had smallpox will still be infected in the future, and the danger cannot be avoided. Therefore, before the invention of cowpox, many places used smallpox scabs to plug their nostrils, so that children would be infected with smallpox once during the specified period. However, the method of vaccination cannot eliminate the dangers of smallpox, although it is slightly lighter. This danger was only removed after the method of cowpox vaccination was invented.</p>
<p>The discoverer of cowpox was Jenner, during the period of 1798. Jenner's name was Edward, born in 1749 (died in 1823), and was a doctor in Gloucestershire, England. Gloucestershire is a place where many cattle are raised, and cattle can also develop a disease similar to smallpox. When they get this disease, blisters appear on the breasts. People who milk cows sometimes get infected, but they only find mild symptoms, and then they do not get infected with smallpox. Therefore, there is a belief among milkers in Gloucestershire: that after being infected with cowpox, one can prevent smallpox. Jenner grew up there, so he naturally knew this situation in detail.</p>
<p>When Jenner was twenty-one years old, he ran to London to study medicine and studied anatomy under the guidance of Hunter. Hunter was a Scotsman and was an extremely famous star in anatomy and surgery. Jenner told Hunter that cowpox could prevent smallpox infection. But Hunter was too busy to study this issue. Therefore, the experimental research fell on Jenner's shoulders.</p>
<p>After he studied medicine, he came to study the beliefs of the milkers in his hometown. Through his experiments and research, he firmly believed that inoculating cowpox serum into the human body had very mild symptoms, but it could prevent smallpox. In 1796, he inoculated cowpox into the human body, and only mild symptoms developed, and then he recovered to health. He then took smallpox and inoculated it into the same person, but smallpox did not occur. This made him even more believe that cowpox could prevent smallpox. Two years later, in 1798, he published his great discovery and told the world.</p>
<p>In recent years, the method of introducing cowpox vaccination has become very popular, and smallpox is much rarer than before. Moreover, it is known that cowpox is not a mysterious thing, but a variant of smallpox. It is because the microorganisms of smallpox are reduced in their intensity after passing through the cow's body, and then inoculated into the human body, so that dangerous symptoms do not occur, but the body can also produce antitoxic effects to resist the growth of smallpox microorganisms. If human smallpox is inoculated into young female cows or rabbits, they can also develop cowpox, which can prove that what I said before is correct.</p>
<h3>Camel Bells</h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>A friend in the South Country wrote saying that, for some unknown reason, he often saw groups of camels walking in the endless desert in his dreams. When the wind came, the air was filled with dust and sand, and the heavy, turbid camel bells echoed in the air. These dreams, one after another, led him into a world of illusion, and the sound of camel bells seemed to be constantly ringing in his ears all day long.</p>
<p>Yes, in the early morning, before dawn, these yellow, massive friends followed their masters, setting off in the early chill, one after the other, silently taking heavy steps, carrying hundreds of pounds of burden on their backs: coal, lime, firewood… In addition to these, there were also bags of dry grass and small bags of steamed buns, which were the food the animals knew belonged to their masters. After walking a long distance, both the camels and the people were hungry, and they would stop silently. Their four furry legs lightly brushed away the dust, and their front knees knelt down. As soon as the masters put the food in front of them, their dull, thick lips began to move, and their eyes stared intently at the sky.</p>
<p>The bells under their necks rang. Besides the sound of the camels chewing and the masters coughing as they swallowed dry food, this was the only sound. This tone gently rippled and spread out like water patterns, entertaining the animals themselves and entertaining the masters, whose faces were full of wind and frost as they chewed and swallowed.</p>
<p>When they encountered another team, everyone waved their whips. The masters, like captains of a cavalry troop, exchanged smiles with their colleagues in a majestic manner.</p>
<p>“Setting off early, eh? Oh, these are really good animals!” The camel drivers always carefully examined other people's animals, just like knights admiring their horses.</p>
<p>"A hundred and ten or so yuan per head!" With the ear flaps on their leather hats flipped up, they walked past proudly, as if showing off their family wealth, just like calculating "how many heads of cattle and sheep," which was also a form of private property.</p>
<p>Some camel drivers were merely hired laborers, without any animals of their own, and worked for others. In this type of camel team, one would not hear many camel bells. They were almost omitted, or could only be found under the necks of the leading animals in the team. Thus, the entire team of people and animals slowly moved forward, listening to this single rhythm. On the raised humps,麻布 sacks or rope nets swayed.</p>
<p>"Hush!" The whip was waved in the air, and the feet that had gradually slowed down sped up again, as if they had put on full power.</p>
<p>If it were summer, the hardworking animals and hardworking people would be hesitant under the scorching sun. The animals each carried heavy burdens, while the people held heavy hearts and heads dripping with sweat. The sound of the camel bells seemed a bit agitated.</p>
<p>Only in winter, when the breath of people and animals floated in the air like white smoke, the swaying of the camel bells warmed their tired hearts.</p>
<p>This sound wave implied a firm and laborious journey.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow (19)</h3>
<p>— Written by (Joseph Conrad), Translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>"He leaned forward bravely. A little pale: this face suits some people. But you have the very beautiful figure of a girl, Miss Bessan."</p>
<p>She was completely panic-stricken again. Because no one had ever said so much to her before.</p>
<p>His tone changed again. "But I'm hungry enough, haven't had breakfast today. Can you find me some bread from where the tea is kept, or-"</p>
<p>She was already gone. He had almost asked her to come in. What did it matter? Anywhere would do. Damn it, now he was in a dilemma. What would his companions think he was doing?</p>
<p>"I'm not begging you like a beggar," he said humorously, taking a slice of buttered bread from the plate she held out to him. "I'm asking you like a friend. My father, you know, is rich."</p>
<p>"He is willing to starve for your sake."</p>
<p>"But I'm starving because of his strange ideas," he said, picking up another slice of bread.</p>
<p>"Everything he has in this world is for you," she retorted.</p>
<p>"Yes, if I came here to live like a punished toad sitting in a hole. Thank you; what would happen if a kick landed on my head? He always has his strange ways of showing love."</p>
<p>"I can wake him up in a week," she suggested timidly.</p>
<p>"He couldn't answer her because he was too hungry; she respectfully held the plate close to his hand, and began to whisper in a quick, anxious voice, just so he could hear. He listened, somewhat surprised, while his chewing gradually slowed down, until finally, his jaws stopped completely. That's his trick, is it?" he said in a very contemptuous, elevated tone. An uncontrollable wave of his arm sent the plate flying from her fingers. He cursed loudly.</p>
<p>She recoiled from him, leaning her hand against the wall.</p>
<p>"No," he said angrily. "He hopes! Hopes I-take his stinking money! ... Who wants his home? Crazy-isn't he! Don't you think so? He has his ideas. He used to want to make me a poor clerk, a lawyer, and now he wants to make me a cursed, caged, docile rabbit. Make me! Make me!" His forced, suppressed, angry laughter surprised her.</p>
<p>"I tell you, the whole world isn't too big for me to fit into-what are you calling? - Bessan-let a person stay coldly in that rabbit-hutch of a drawing-room. He wants me to marry and settle down! And seems to have found a woman for me-terrible to the extreme! Do you know 'Gide' (the woman of 'Punch' in the puppet show, a woman with a funny face), may I ask you?"</p>
<p>Her whole body trembled with silent, inner sobbing; but he did not notice her pain because of his excessive anger and agitation. He was extremely angry and contemptuous of such ideas. A window upstairs banged open again.</p>
<p>"A joke-seeking messenger," old Hagerbot announced decisively at the window in a firm voice. His voice, it seemed to Bessan, made the night itself turn mad - pouring madness and misfortune upon the earth. "Now I know what's wrong with the people here, my dear. Ah, of course. With this mad fellow running around. Don't pay attention to him, Bessan. Bessan, I say!"</p>

<p>February Contract Opens</p>
<p>Margin Skyrockets 38.8 Yuan</p>
<p>Swap Over... Many Rumors</p>
<p>Shorts Covering... Bullish Trend Intense</p>
<p>The gold market has been in a continuous slump, due to the pressure from the swap during the January trading period. Now that the swap hurdle has been overcome and the new February contract has entered the market, a reaction immediately appears. Buying interest has recovered, and demand in the market exceeds supply. Rumors are circulating that China will implement similar inflationary measures, and shorts are urgently covering, triggering a bullish trend. It is noted that in the early morning, the overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US were flat. The forward silver price in Monte Video showed only slight fluctuations. Exchange rates rose slightly, and the price of raw gold in London fell by three and a half pence. Market sentiment clearly showed a reaction and was also influenced by the after-effects of the Saturday noon closing. Preliminary trading outside the market opened and immediately rose to 75.6 yuan, mainly due to a difference of over ten yuan in the swap. Buyers were eager, and the price rose again to 78.9 yuan. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcements showed the UK and US rates flat, and the Customs gold unit was reduced by 0.04. The standard margin price fell back to 1003.7 yuan, indicating a decline. However, the opening in the morning was still at a high level. After the opening, although the exchange rate market tightened, there was some market manipulation. However, the overall trend was very easy to push up. Banks were also aggressively buying, quickly breaking through the 80 yuan mark and rising rapidly. When the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced that both the UK and US exchange rates remained unchanged, banks took advantage of the high prices to release holdings, leading to a decline. However, because exchange rates soon became difficult to settle, the situation was still stable at this time. Before long, major players continuously sold off, causing a temporary drop. The silver equalization tax announcement was unchanged. After this, the market hovered, but the exchange rate market continued to tighten. Banks were mutually dealing, and the psychology of Chinese merchants became firm. The market was even more active, and major players placed numerous orders. The supply side lacked strength, and prices finally rose high. Sellers who took advantage of the high prices to sell also poured in. After this, prices fluctuated sharply, rising and falling frequently. However, although the selling side was strong, it was difficult for the overall trend to fall, and it was easy to rise. The noon closing situation was also favorable. Rumors of favorable conditions for buyers, such as the non-convertibility of paper money and the reduction of the gold content of currency, arose, boosting market sentiment. Traders aggressively bought bills of exchange, and the domestic market tightened. The gold market frequently experienced bullish trends. Although there was much fluctuation in the middle, the sharp fall in silver and the revised reduction in HSBC's official exchange rate announcement resulted in sustained buying interest in the market. Shorts were urgently and aggressively covering, and major players were making efforts to buy, causing the selling side's momentum to fade. The market successively broke through the 1,000 yuan mark, rising to 1,009 yuan. The fierceness of the wave was unexpected. The exchange rate market then slightly eased, and the closing price fell back into the 1,000 yuan mark. The market situation of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 976.8 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, if the sixteen yuan posted by the swap's long position is added, it would be 2.1 yuan higher. It then became 6.4 yuan. The Dalian group, Heng Yu, Hui Xiang, etc., placed orders and rose to 8.5 yuan. Fu Xing, Yong Shun Mao, Fu Yu, Heng Tai sold, falling back to 6.5 yuan. However, because the exchange rate market tightened, market sentiment was finally favorable. Wan Xing, Heng Tai, Da Fa, Yong Hong Kang, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Zhen Tai, Tong Chun, etc., all entered the market. The US dollar bank traded at 5625 for January, and rose to 83.2 yuan. Heng Tai, Wan Chang, Yong Ri Chang, etc., took advantage of the high prices to sell. The Mallory rate for January at a half penny, and fell to around two yuan. Before long, the January half-penny rate became difficult to settle. Shen Kang, Han Heng, Zheng Chang, Fu Xing, Yong Yi Cheng re-entered the market at 3.3 yuan. Fu Xing, Yong Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Wan Xing, Da Chang Xiang suddenly sold, falling to 1.1 yuan. The silver equalization tax announcement was unchanged, and the situation stabilized. However, the overall trend was stable. Shun Mao, Chun Yuan, Yong Da, De Cheng, Fu Tai Heng, Hong Kang, Yong Fu Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, Rui Kang, Yong Feng, etc., successively bought, gradually rising to 4.8 yuan. Qing Yu, Da Fa, Yong Chang, Da Yuan Mao, Yong Yong Li sold off, falling to 3.3 yuan. Chinese merchants continued to buy aggressively, and the domestic market tightened. Yuan Kang Xiang, Fu Xing, Yong Feng Zhao, Feng Chang, Heng Yu Hui Xiang all came to place orders. Before long, it rose again to 5.1 yuan. Fu Xing, Yong Ding Kang, Yuan Sheng Yong, Yuan Chang Yong, etc., sold at high prices, falling to 2.8 yuan. At this time, banks were mutually dealing, and the exchange rate market did not change much. After Heng Chang Yong, Fu An Da Fa, Yong Chang Sheng Yong, etc., successively maintained the market, it rose back to 4.8 yuan. Fu Xing Yong limited selling, and Yu Qing Yong Han Heng also came to supply, falling to 2.8 yuan. However, market sentiment was prosperous, and buyers were extremely eager to buy at low prices. Zhao Feng Chang, Fu Xing Yong Yuan, Mao Yong, etc., successively bought, and once 5.1 was broken through, the buying momentum was even stronger. The closing price rose to 986 yuan, mainly due to rumors that paper money would not be convertible, and so on. Therefore, after the closing, it continued to rise, and major players such as Shun Li, Fu Xing Yong Yi Cheng, Da Chang Xiang, etc., successively placed orders, rising to over eight yuan.</p>
<p>The after-market opening was at 988.4 yuan. Heng Xing, Heng Yu, Yi Cheng, Fu Yu, Fu Xing Yong, Chun Yuan Yong, Qing Fa Yong all entered the market and rose to 92.7 yuan. Tong Chun Da, De Cheng Yuan sold to 1.3 yuan, but market sentiment was extremely favorable. Rumors such as currency inflation and reducing the gold content of currency reappeared. Fu Xing Yong, Hong Li Heng Yu, Da Chang Xiang Heng Xing Yuan, etc., came to enter the market. Citibank bought US dollars for January at 75, and Chinese merchants aggressively bought shillings for February at 125, rising to 7.5 yuan. Fu Xing Yong Yuan, Chang Yong Yu, Qing Yong, etc., sold at 5.2 yuan, but scattered shorts covered urgently. Da Fa Yong Heng Yu also entered the market, rising to 7.7 yuan. Fu Xing Yong Heng Chang Yong, Fu Chang Da, De Cheng Da Fa Yong suddenly sold, falling to 5.6 yuan. Heng Yu Qing Zhao Feng Chang, Fu An placed orders, rising to 9.8 yuan. Da Chang Xiang Da, De Cheng Fu Xing Yong, Yi Cheng Chang Da, etc., sold off one after another, falling back to 5.3 yuan. The initial telegram from Bombay showed a decrease of twelve annas. There was still struggle at this time. Then Yuan Chang Yong Fu Xing Yong, etc., entered the market at seven yuan, but because Da De Cheng, Ding Chang, Fu Xing Yong still supplied, it fell to 4.5 yuan. Market sentiment was extremely favorable, difficult to curb. Before long, Fu An, the Dalian group, Zhao Feng Chang Fu Xing Yong, Hui Xiang, etc., continuously bought, and then rose back to 8.5 yuan. Shun Mao Hong Xing Heng Chang Yong took advantage of high prices to sell, so it fell back to within seven yuan. Before long, Heng Chang Yong bought back. Fu An Ding Kang, Fu Chang Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Mao Yong Da, De Cheng Hong Kang Yong Shun Mao Chang Da Heng Xing Yuan Xiang Feng Tong Fu, etc., successively bought, and the selling side was helpless.

Banks opened and immediately aggressively bought, and the process immediately tightened. When HSBC's official rate was announced, the British and US rates were flat. Although banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, settlement soon became difficult again. The psychology of Chinese merchants shifted to firm, and the appetite trended towards buying, but it was difficult to obtain sellers. After entering the market, banks mutually dealt, and the process stabilized, but the potential was quite tight. Although there were no transactions at noon, the trend seemed favorable due to rumors. After-market rumors regarding China's currency inflation intensified. The psychology of Chinese merchants was greatly boosted, and they aggressively bought. Although banks sold, it did not help. Indian silver also shrank by twelve and nine point nine annas. HSBC's official rate was revised downwards, the British by 25 and the American by half a yuan. The process tightened repeatedly.

<h3>Rampant Rumors of Yarn and Cotton Inflation</h3>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Soar</p>
<p>Forward Yarn Up Two Dollars or So</p>
<p>Forward Cotton Up Six or Seven Jiao</p>
<p>The yarn market initially weakened then rose, the situation is good, but Japanese merchants are single-mindedly inclined to sell off, suffering heavy oppression from them. Only the Tongcheng Company is struggling mightily as a bull, having bought 300 bales of 20-count Fugui yarn cheaply from the Sichuan group for immediate loading, which shows their painstaking efforts. In the afternoon, the market suddenly soared, with rumors spreading that a paper money policy to realize inflation was imminent, and speculators were greatly active.</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the bid yarn market, due to the mediocrity of foreign cotton, and the continued selling by Japanese merchants, the number of bales was not as large as the previous day. However, the Tongcheng Company sold 300 bales of 20-count Fugui yarn to the Sichuan group for immediate loading, cutting the market price by three to four dollars, boosting market sentiment. The near month result rose by 1.2 jiao, the far month was flat. The afternoon opening was calm, but when auctioned to the far month, it became firm, with the price of gold soaring, and market rumors arose again, saying that the paper money policy would be implemented. Therefore, after auctioning two or three rounds, it jumped wildly by 1.7 to 8 jiao, with the result that each month rose by 1.3 to 5 jiao to 2.1 to 2 jiao. It was found that Dachang sold 2,250 bales, Tongji 650 bales, Shenji 850 bales, Yida 1,350 bales, Dachang 550 bales, Dafu 500 bales, Hengyi 1,150 bales, Yukang 500 bales, Yuanda 1,100 bales, Jinchang 1,400 bales, Junchang 1,200 bales, Renfeng 650 bales, and Tongxing 550 bales.

<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the spot cotton business remained slack. Sources from all sides have increased compared to the past, so public sentiment is calm. However, in the afternoon, the market suddenly tended to rise, and the situation was sharp. Many in the market said that the paper money policy might be implemented, and at the same time, the gold price rose again, and the exchange rate tended to shrink, so people were excited, and the market advanced to a high point. However, Tongcheng's bulls closed out, with 14,000 dans of foreign cotton.</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the bid cotton market, American cotton showed mixed ups and downs, but Indian cotton was still expensive and rose another half price, so there was still no development in the market. As a result, the prices for each month were flat and did not rise or fall. In the afternoon opening, the market rose sharply, and the situation was very tight. Buyers flocked in, and it was heard that rumors were rife in the market, saying that there was a reform of the paper money policy, so speculators were active, and market prices gradually tightened. Each month rose by 3.5 to 5.5 jiao. It was found that Dafu sold 14,200 dans, Hengyi 1,500 dans, Changyu 5,400 dans, Jinchang 1,000 dans, Yichang 3,500 dans, Runkang 1,600 dans, Daji 1,800 dans, Yuanda 3,700 dans, Junchang 1,600 dans, Tongxing 2,900 dans, Yongchang 1,400 dans, and Yuanxingchang 2,400 dans.

<p>Total 778,400</p>
<p>The current cotton sales are still sluggish. Factories are unwilling to buy at high prices, but the forward cotton is trending upward, and the holders of goods are tight-lipped, resulting in reduced transactions. The sources included 1,950 bales of Yaohua cotton and 960 bales of Tonghua cotton.</p>
<p>Shandong American cotton 54.00 Hengfeng Factory imported 199 pieces of spot goods to the factory. Tianjin American cotton 54.75 Shenxin Factory imported 178 pieces of spot goods to the factory.</p>

<h3>Bond Market in a Turbulent Storm</h3>
<p>Sellers Eagerly Sell, Prices Plunge in the First Two Rounds</p>
<p>In the Afternoon, Market Sentiment Turns Around, and Winds Suddenly Pick Up</p>
<p>丨Still Down One and a Half Yuan丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the downward trend was even more severe at first. Numbers 16 and 53, etc., were particularly enthusiastic in selling, and retail investors also sold one after another. Market prices plummeted, becoming more and more severe. Sellers scrambled to sell first, and most retail investors also turned from bullish to bearish, and the situation was extremely bad. Yesterday afternoon's market price was already about ten yuan lower than the highest price this year. Starting from February 1924, the repayment of principal from consolidated salt tax will increase, and the return of silver dollars within the year will gradually start. The news in the afternoon suddenly turned around. It was said that the authorities would implement currency devaluation to maintain the market. In addition, the bid gold soared by thirty to forty yuan, and cotton yarn also rose by more than two yuan. According to economic principles, currency devaluation will naturally lead to inflation, and public bonds will hardly be able to remain low. Looking at yesterday's first round, it fell by six to seven jiao, and the second round fell by several jiao to more than one yuan. Large traders on the scene intended to suppress the price, which those who were slightly familiar with the market situation could tell. In the afternoon's round, the new news spread throughout the market. Because some people were still skeptical, it only recovered by a few jiao to one yuan, and some varieties were still down by three to four jiao. It can be seen that some people still have little understanding of currency devaluation. Once a squeeze occurs in the future, a wild rise will occur immediately. As a result of yesterday's market price, it was still down by a few jiao to one and a half yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be around 30 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Prices Rise Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market conditions for each month generally showed a stable and revolving trend. The quotation for foreign wheat was slightly down by two jiao for Chicago near-term and about eight fen for far-term, while Canada was down by two to three jiao. When the opening price was quoted for foreign wheat, public sentiment was flat. Subsequently, due to the continued absorption by large bulls, the market held steady. However, as the settlement was near, the buying and selling by all parties was limited, so there was little excitement. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the near and far terms were all firm. This month's term was due to the slight disposal of spot goods by the Tianjin customer group, who heard that the delivery in Tianjin was offered at 5.5 jiao, which was much cheaper than the standard. In the far term, the exchange rate was shrinking due to the continued entry of large traders, so public sentiment gradually rose. Observing the subsequent steps, it is feared that a fall will be difficult to achieve. As a result, this month's term recovered by 1.25 fen compared to the previous week, January was up by 2 fen, February was up by 2.25 fen, March was up by 1.5 fen, April was up by 2.25 fen, and May was up by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Forward Wheat Market Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the forward wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market conditions for each month showed a stable and firm trend. The quotation for foreign wheat was slightly down by eight fen to two jiao for Chicago and about two to three jiao for Canada. When the opening price was quoted, this month's term was flat in both the morning and afternoon transactions due to the approaching end, and there was little change in price. As for the far-term months, the morning was generally calm, but in the afternoon, as the market turned active, the buying interest was slightly stronger, and the opening prices for each month gradually became firm. As a result, this month's term remained unchanged, January rose by 2 fen, February rose by 3 fen, March rose by 2 fen. The current wheat market has once again become a bottleneck. Although dealers have opened prices, factories have no intention of allocating purchases, so there is no quotation.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat, Europe is unhealthy, and the Amal wheat harvest is approaching, and the supply will be inexhaustible. Buyers here are hesitant, and it is expected that the market will not undergo major changes in the coming days.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat 14th 15th Increase/Decrease</p>

<h3>Three Ships of Foreign Rice Arrive</h3>
<p>One Ship of Siamese Rice Sinks in the Port</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation was soft in the morning due to the arrival of large batches of fixed orders. Local customers were very sluggish, but after noon, inland areas competed for broken rice, while this street handled Saigon Siamese machine rice, and the market situation immediately turned around, and the market price gradually increased by five fen. A total of more than 1,000 bags of broken rice and machine rice were traded. New fixed orders arrived from Saigon in two ships, the company ships Pinawin and Aerete Mara, which were imported and are now docked at Yitaixingji, with a total of more than 50,000 bags. In addition, the Norwegian ship Harvard, loaded with 15,445 bags (1,500 tons) of Siamese rice, was sunk by the Tongde round in Lujiazi when it was imported yesterday morning. As a result, all Siamese machine-broken rice in the market became firm.</p>
<p>There is a slight stock of Ke Xian rice in the market, and arrivals continue to arrive at the end. The local customers are active in selling, and the market remains flat. Yesterday, Wuxi and Zhejiang inland areas handled 1,300 bags, and this street handled 1,700 bags. The market price is no different from the previous market.</p>
<h3>He Xia is Mainly Strong but Prices Fall by a Jiao or So</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from all groups suddenly poured in, with more than 60 numbers arriving, totaling more than 9,000 shi of goods, which caused public sentiment to become weak again, and the market color declined. Sales in Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Tianjin, and other groups continued to advance by 700 to 800 bags, but the overall situation was still that the supply exceeded the demand. As a result, the price of thick japonica rice fell by a jiao or so, and the market for late rice was reduced by several fen to nearly a jiao. And various colors such as Du Yangjian and Yin Yuan continued to fall by one or two jiao due to the lack of sales channels.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 45-6 of He Xia's various goods arrived. The market's various sales of white japonica rice are gradually advancing in packaging, while the sales of loose rice are sluggish. Early thin rice and various sharp changes, Yin Yuan, are also very quiet. The market price of white japonica rice is down by nearly a jiao, and the remaining goods are tired.</p>
<h3>Bran is Not Abundant in Stock or Sales</h3>
<p>The bran market has been extremely calm in recent days. Although the stock is not very abundant, external dealers have not been active. Only a few sporadic transactions are taking place inland. Prices are slightly weaker than last week, with mixed bran quoted at 2.7 yuan and Fuxin bran quoted at 7.5 jiao.</p>

<h3>Sickness and Medicine</h3>
<p>— Field Dweller</p>
<p>If a “Motorcar” breaks down, it needs repair, and if a person gets sick, they need medicine. This is the same “natural law”!</p>
<p>I don’t have the good fortune to sit in a “Motorcar,” and I get sick two or three to five or six times a year. Since that’s the case, then let’s talk about “sickness” and “medicine,” because that’s a more personal issue. Moreover, the rag-picking Xiao Liu Zi will lie on the road and cry about a stomachache, and the “young master” resting on a wild duck down pillow will sometimes get a fever. Sickness for people is just that equal.</p>
<p>Everyone is afraid of getting sick, and taking medicine isn’t exactly welcome either. From children who are “still wet behind the ears” to old men with “white beards and eyebrows,” they all groan when they get sick, and their eyes don’t want to look at people. This shows that being sick is very painful. “Even heroes fear the grind of illness!” If heroes can’t bear it, then ordinary people can forget about enduring it. Therefore, if you’re not sick, then so be it, but if you do get sick, you have to get treated quickly. After all, today’s doctors are all “devoted to saving the world.” For one dollar and twenty cents, they write a prescription, clearly stating your pulse, tongue coating, bowel movements, and whether you have constipation or diarrhea, and they prescribe the amount of licorice and dried tangerine peel. Don’t think that just because the first dose doesn’t work, you should distrust your doctor. It’s said that prudent doctors use the first prescription as a “test of the illness.” Then, they gradually diagnose and treat you with a second, third, fourth, and so on. Although you’ll suffer in bed for a few more days and spend a few more dollars, it’s not a waste because they’re willing to carefully treat you day after day, so you won’t die.</p>
<p>Sick families without cultivation mostly believe in Western medicine because Western medicine is “effective on the spot.” They’ll stick a needle in your thigh, making you scream like a slaughtered pig. If your head feels hot, they’ll give you two ice packs. If your body is cold, they’ll start a fire for you. If your stomach feels uncomfortable, they’ll give you medicine water. Perhaps if you get a boil, they’ll cut out a piece of flesh. Some say this seems too disloyal, but “dying” and “coming back to life” isn’t a bad way to be “straightforward and quick.”</p>
<p>From this perspective, Chinese and Western doctors each have their advantages. I’ve seen sick families invite both Chinese and Western doctors to their homes. This is probably because their family has a lot of money. With one more doctor, their life has one more layer of protection. In the event that they reach a point where the “real illness is hard to cure,” then it’s good to let their descendants say something loud on the “obituary.” After all, the money won’t be spent in vain. However, there’s another group of people who can’t afford to see a doctor when they get sick, and that’s really bad. Although doctors are “devoted to saving the world,” you still have to pay for the rickshaw puller, the maid, and the Western-style house in the shikumen. The famous ones are even more valuable. Even if there are “reduced rates for the poor” or even something like a “commemorative free consultation,” you still can’t swallow the prescription. Isn’t it even worse for a doctor to examine you if there’s no medicine to take? Therefore, some people say that poor people shouldn’t get sick in the first place, and there’s some truth to that.</p>
<p>However, as I said at the beginning, sickness is very fair. Rag pickers and people who sit in “Motorcars” all have the qualifications and opportunities to get sick. However, the issue of seeing a doctor and taking medicine isn’t something everyone can talk about. Therefore, it’s best not to be poor when you’re a person, and if you’re poor, it’s best not to get sick. “Good health is a blessing for the poor.” To hell with “Motorcars</p>
<h3>Winter Solstice</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>It was his most triumphant year. The South Goods store on East Street closed down due to the owner's death, leaving him as the only store in Wujia Town selling South Goods. Partly it was the encouragement of friends, and partly there was a genuine need for business expansion. When he retrieved the large silver dollars accumulated over the years from copper coins and silver dimes, an uncontrollable joy spread through his body like a snake. They first put up a sign saying "Renovating the facade, business as usual." Every morning, his huge body moved in and out of the store, partly to respond to the customers' congratulations, "Boss, congratulations!", and partly for fear of hindering the carpenters' work. Although it was late autumn and early winter, moisture beaded on his large head. The mischievous children clapped their little hands at his door and shouted, "Steamed buns, two copper coins for one." He always wore a smiling face and gave each child a piece of banana candy.</p>
<p>The facade was newly renovated, and the goods were shipped in. To commemorate the grand opening of the new store, there was a special three-day bargain sale. Before the winter solstice, the place was packed with people every day, and moisture naturally beaded on his large head, but "Boss, Boss," he wished he had more than two hands.</p>
<p>This year, the first business to close in Wujia Town was Dexiang Grocery Store. He took stock of his money and goods, and his big belly swayed even more impressively. Moreover, on New Year's Eve, his footprints were found in the restaurant.</p>
<p>Although everyone in town knew the big fat man, he had never done business in the hotel. The waiter greeted him: "Fat boss, congratulations on your fortune!"</p>
<p>"Haha, may everyone get rich, ha..."</p>
<p>As he moved his body, he nodded to the seated guests.</p>
<p>On the fifth day of the New Year, he welcomed the God of Wealth, and his store was particularly lively. According to rural custom, businesses close for five days during the New Year. After tonight, business would resume tomorrow, so welcoming the God of Wealth was an even bigger event than eating New Year's Eve dinner. The fat man felt that the safety lamp was not bright enough, so he rented a gasoline lamp. Neighbors nearby came to join in the fun. He remembered that he didn't send the guests away until after midnight.</p>
<p>As his usual smiling face unfolded, he was awakened by a shout. A child standing as tall as the counter stood in the store:</p>
<p>"Fat uncle, two copper coins for some white sugar, quick!"</p>
<p>"What's the rush!" He didn't expect his voice to come out so loud.</p>
<p>"My little brother is crying. My older sister is feeding him porridge, but he doesn't want it. She's buying white sugar to feed him sugary porridge," the child innocently replied.</p>
<p>"Where's your mom?"</p>
<p>"Mom went to Shanghai this morning to ask Dad for money."</p>
<p>These words satisfied him. The grievances in his heart seemed to have been expressed to this child. He gave the child goods worth twice the price, waving his hand repeatedly:</p>
<p>"Go back quickly."</p>
<p>The sun was already overhead, and the sunlight in the store had receded to the center of the street. The black dog was sleeping soundly on the steps again. He raised his big head and looked at the calendar on the wall, muttering:</p>
<p>"Today is the eighteenth. Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the day after the day after tomorrow is the winter solstice!" (The End)</p>
<h3>A Daughter Belongs to Another Family</h3>
<p>— (Rural Sketch)</p>
<h3>Spider</h3>
<p>— Lu Yan</p>
<p>As long as it is sunny, you can see spiders weaving their webs in the corners of houses, especially after a storm in the summer. However, in the city, with such magnificent high-rise buildings, so spotless and truly "flawless," where can you find a trace of spiders? Here, we must deeply lament for the spiders who weave their own nets, cleverly set traps, and capture small flying insects!</p>
<p>Even if they occasionally come to second-class buildings, it is only a fleeting moment, as they will be banished to oblivion by the servants. The fate of spiders in the high-rise buildings of the city is that their tracks are rarely seen. However, in such a dilapidated house, it seems that its fate will soon be eliminated. Moreover, in this ever-changing city, under the concept of "every inch of land is worth gold," it is inevitable that they will be targeted by people seeking profit. Naturally, living here is because the rent is cheaper, and the atmosphere is outdated. Modern city dwellers (except for another kind of person) cannot stand it. For this reason, they are naturally ridiculed. Therefore, in this dilapidated house, it goes without saying that in better locations, or like in a dark corner of the wall, with a sliver of light, near where people live, there is naturally a spider's graceful presence. She weaves her web there, waiting for small flying insects to fly into it. However, the small flying insects fly into the net not out of any bad intentions, but because they want to find a way out, because everyone loves the light. Being trapped in the darkness is what no one wants, unless it is another kind of thing.</p>
<p>In this situation, I happened to see a spider hanging down from a crack in a small house. At the same time, it released strands of silk that drifted with the wind. It seemed that its purpose was to secure itself to something. With the help of the air, it became even more rampant. After all, there was nothing for it to bind to in the empty surroundings, but time and space are dynamic. There are various forms in every second, even if we cannot see them all at once. However, it was too arrogant. Without paying attention, a sudden gust of wind blew down a fallen leaf, which happened to fall on its web. In such a dilapidated state, it naturally broke. Without caring, it walked back onto its broken web, picked up the remnants of the damaged net, and reorganized its new web, spinning vigorously as it did its work. Before long, in the small gap where the light came in, it had woven a new web. It was ready for the small flying insects to fly into it.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but think of her full of plans. Setting up her web in a very suitable place would allow her to obtain the victory she needed. That's right, this is an opportunity, and she understood this opportunity. The small flying insects were completely oblivious. She took advantage of a sliver of light, anticipating that the small flying insects would go to the light. The light is naturally a great sky, where they can soar freely. Here, she had a very good opportunity. In this accidental feeling, I understood this side of life, and then I understood the speculators!</p>
<h3>Killing a Chicken</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>In an overly lonely state, a kind of fantasy often emerges from a clear mind. Even a common thing that people don't pay attention to often lingers in sensitive thoughts and leads to extraordinary insights. I observe everything carefully, from a tiny ant to a huge elephant, from a spark to the raging flames in a boiler, with the same eyes and thoughts. Recently, I suddenly had a perverse whim: to see a tragic scene of killing, but at the same time, I didn't want to get this opportunity too easily. Although I am not a timid or idealistic person, I can't bear to see a fresh, lively life suddenly fall on its own stream of hot blood!</p>
<p>Speaking of watching the killing of a chicken this time, it took the courage of going to an execution ground.</p>
<p>This morning, there was a bright sky outside the skylight. Two rays of sunlight squeezed in through the cracks in the wall and licked the white curtains, licking them into two circles of brilliant light. I love the morning air, so I got up and got out of bed. Just as I was about to go for a walk in the nearby park, an unfamiliar fellow countryman came with two chickens in his hand. At first, I was very suspicious, but later I learned that a relative in the countryside had asked him to bring them to me. So, after I sent the fellow countryman out the door, a problem lay before me waiting to be solved. The problem was the two chickens. "Having a few more friends in my not-so-spacious room carries the risk of stepping on each other's frostbite. How can I raise chickens! Moreover, chicken droppings all over the floor are a hindrance to both hygiene and appearance. How should I deal with them?" I leaned back on the sofa and pondered for a cigarette's time.</p>
<p>"Give them to a friend, but I don't want to use animal life as a gift to show my goodwill to others. Although in today's society, people's lives are often given as gifts to each other, I still maintain this unique idea. Isn't that too stupid? But, for me, it is a principle that must be maintained. I would rather kill, cook, and eat these two chickens myself. I don't want to use them to flatter and bribe others in order to gain some extra benefits." So, when I dropped the second cigarette butt, I had a solution to the problem: "I'll just kill them and eat them myself!" Thus, the scene of killing the chicken unfolded!</p>
<p>The second landlord's helper was a skilled chicken killer and was willing to do it for me. He familiarly bent the neck of the female chicken towards its wings. I was already a little chilly, but reason told myself, "It is a creature that is eaten by people anyway." But watching him pluck the feathers around the throat, revealing the peach-colored skin, the female chicken's legs and claws also began to shake, knowing that she was feeling pain, I couldn't bear it. I regretted not giving it away, but reason told myself, "She also pecked at insects when she was alive," so I watched the bright blade plunging into the peach-colored skin, and when the blood flowed straight out, I almost wanted to hide.</p>
<p>The male chicken was also caught by the helper while running away, and he bent its neck, plucked its feathers, and wielded the knife, and blood flowed in the same way.</p>
<p>Two fresh, lively lives were destroyed in an instant. From this perverse situation, I thought of the execution ground, and from killing the chicken, I imagined killing people. I raised my head, and it was a clear sky.</p>

<h3>What to do When I Can't Attend Night School!</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Since the summer vacation of my fifteenth year, I have been forced by circumstances to abandon my books and become an apprentice in a store in this city. This year, I have finally finished my apprenticeship.</p>
<p>Now I feel that my knowledge is very shallow, and when I think about my future prospects, there is really no bright hope. Every night, watching people carrying books to night school to study and seek advanced knowledge, I am very envious. So I have repeatedly asked my boss to allow me to read for two hours at night. But my boss is a thorough conservative with feudal ideas, not only refusing my request but also threatening to stop my business. Although I have been rejected several times, my desire to study has not diminished.</p>
<p>Recently, I have come up with many methods, but I cannot achieve the goal of studying at night. It really makes me extremely sad!</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Sir, you are a mentor to young people like me. Please tell me a way to deepen my knowledge! I wish you</p>
<p>Well-being, Hu Jing</p>
<p>Editor's Note: It is indeed the most painful thing in the world to have an extremely high desire for knowledge but not be able to satisfy it. However, most old-fashioned store owners cannot understand the meaning and importance of learning, so Mr. Hu was refused by his boss for wanting to attend night school. We believe that looking at this phenomenon in Shanghai alone, the number of young people who feel as troubled as Mr. Hu is countless. Not to mention the interior.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Hu should continue to work hard and ask someone related to the store owner and with a clear mind to speak on his behalf. The words should be tactful and pleasant to reach the goal of learning.</p>
<p>If this step is also difficult to achieve, we advise Mr. Hu not to be too discouraged, thinking that there is no hope for learning. He can secretly entrust someone to find a better opportunity and try to get rid of the boss's constraints. On the other hand, he should think of other ways to satisfy his desire for knowledge.</p>
<p>Regarding the method of learning, we believe that it is certainly better to go to school, but if the environment does not allow it and there is no such opportunity, you can also obtain the knowledge you need without going to school. Going to day school or night school is just to get a little tool knowledge. To acquire advanced knowledge, you must rely on your own efforts, which cannot be obtained solely from school. Therefore, we advise Mr. Hu not to be disappointed. He should make the greatest determination and use his spare time to carry out self-study. Dedicating himself to studying whenever he has a little time, with years of effort, his knowledge will increase imperceptibly.</p>
<p>This newspaper has established a circulating library on the third floor of the Continental Commercial Building, providing books suitable for the general uneducated, without charging readers any fees. It has also established a reading guidance department to solve readers' questions about books as much as possible. Mr. Hu, if you intend to study on your own, can join the library. For detailed information and procedures, please contact the library directly to inquire about everything.</p>

<p>Osmanthus fragrance fills the shade of trees. The battlefield of literature is the same everywhere. Old events are revisited with many sighs. Nonsense about the imperial examination is full of fun. The new words are compiled into strings and frets again. How can old dreams bear the rain and dew? Relatives and friends send examination boxes one after another. Osmanthus rounds and lotus seeds have the same meaning. There is also a good wish. Continuous success is spoken of in the autumn wind. Temporary shops on Qingyun Street. All kinds of goods are sold at public prices. Ladies and gentlemen gather like a city. Shoulders rub and wheels knock, making the road difficult to pass. Each official examiner enters with thorn barriers. Strict defense is not willing to loosen. Wooden benches and cloth curtains are prepared by themselves. Careful preparation is endless. (There are also) Qingyun ladders and various uses. Auspicious words are double-related in the tube. The examination sedan travels quickly without curtains. The examination tools are carried in the east and west. They ask if the scholar must pass. The good news of the name is heard in the sedan. The morning light is slightly revealed, and the rooster crows three times. At the fifth watch, the roll call is sleepy-eyed. Lantern signs are divided left and right. Ten thousand people enter in an orderly manner. The signed card is held in hand and hurriedly entered. The examination basket is carried on the back and the chest heaves. The thin and timid body is difficult to walk. The bitterness is full of resentment. The examination rooms are lined up like wild geese. The words "cosmos, flood, wilderness" are all understood. They recognize their seat numbers. The tents are hung up and it is lively and bustling. A battle on the literary field builds a miracle.</p>

<h3>New Trends in American Architecture</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Before the World War, Americans, relying on their wealth and material progress, were obsessed with tall buildings, competing and boasting with each other. In prosperous cities such as New York and Chicago, due to the high land prices and large populations, the rise of tall buildings was a natural and inevitable result of the environment. A famous American architect once said, "Because of the system of tall buildings, a businessman in New York City can conduct five times more meetings and negotiations in one morning than in London or Paris." From this, we can see how important this commercial convenience is in today's economically developed society.</p>
<p>High land prices and large populations are not the only reasons for the rise of tall buildings. We can say that the curiosity and vanity of Americans are a driving force for success. At the same time, the development of American engineering and the abundance and cheapness of materials are also major factors. For example, although Americans were able to build 500-foot-tall buildings thanks to the convenience of electric elevators, if engineers had not invented the simultaneous use of two elevators on the same shaft, then 1,000-foot-tall buildings would have faced difficulties in elevator transportation.</p>
<p>The architecture of the "Old World," those buildings taller than five or six stories, were merely extensions of previous architecture. The tall buildings on Fifth Avenue in New York had twelve stories, which was considered a great feat at the time. However, we see that its cornices still followed the old style, pre-carved and installed. Its usefulness was insufficient to cover even a small part of the wall, and compared to the entire building, its size seemed even more discordant, making people laugh.</p>
<p>As buildings gradually increased in height, this Italian palace-style construction method was abandoned, and the use of steel frames flourished. The Woolworth Building in New York City is a large project that Americans boast about. Its straight-line steel frame is very magnificent. However, this was only a slight improvement over the past. American architects still couldn't help but use spires, church-style roofs, niches, pilasters, and Gothic-style ornaments, which, besides giving people a religious impression, had no meaning whatsoever. Later, other tall buildings were erected, and although they did not entirely carry the remnants of the past, they still inevitably retained some traces of antiquity at the base and roof.</p>
<p>At this time, Americans felt a strong interest in tall buildings, and municipal and residential hygiene were also greatly affected. Therefore, New York had a new law called the "Zoning Law." This law not only restricted the height of buildings but also restricted the style of architecture. Generally speaking, this law stipulates that builders are only allowed to build buildings of any height on a portion of their entire land, and the height of other street-facing portions must not exceed several times the street width, with the ratio depending on the area. This means that in some areas, the height of street-facing buildings must not exceed 200 feet, and in some areas, it must not exceed 250 feet. Beyond this, the building should gradually slope inward so that sunlight and air can reach the bottom of the building. As a result, many large buildings, such as the New York Telephone Company Building and the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, were built in succession, all subject to the provisions of this law. The design of the windows of these buildings is quite different from the ordinary, smaller and densely arranged, appearing like spots from a distance. Moreover, the entire building does not have any ancient decorations, making American architecture a new school to this point.</p>
<p>This is the new trend in American architecture. Architects pay attention to engineering design, interior lighting work, and the planning of light and air on the streets around the building. Someone said that today's architects are like sculptors, who can complete any style of building. This statement seems to be quite true, because we now have steel-frame concrete construction methods, strong and light materials never seen before in the world, and countless new engineering equipment. The form of the building is simply not difficult to construct. Therefore, today's architects often make a clay or wax model during the design process, arbitrarily arranging it to achieve the matching they envision. How is this different from the art of sculpture?</p>
<p>Due to the legal restrictions on tall buildings, the taller the building, the larger the ground area occupied at the bottom, and the independence of each building becomes more obvious. After the city is filled with tall buildings, we will no longer see connected buildings standing side by side. The shapes of the buildings are also novel and different. Some can be called steel and glass buildings, some are wrapped in shining metal panels, some are entirely black, and some are as white as snow. There is no commonality in between. Ancient Greek, Roman, and Gothic architecture could not escape many common features, and the efforts of architects seemed limited, but this is not the case with modern architecture. People's minds can also be free and unrestrained, each seeking possible progress in art. This new trend makes American architecture a very promising new development in the world, containing the spirit of freedom and independence in architecture.</p>
<h3>Talking About Skyscrapers</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>(1) What is a skyscraper?</p>
<p>The so-called skyscraper is a building that seems to scrape the sky. Its summit is so high that it looks like it is touching the top of the sky. "Scraping the sky" is used to describe its height reaching into the clouds. The sky has no top, so how can it be scraped? Therefore, the height of a building cannot truly scrape the sky. Recently, a 22-story skyscraper has been completed in Shanghai. For a time, the names of the International Hotel and the Joint Savings Society were spread by word of mouth. Everyone in the streets and alleys talked about skyscrapers. In fact, everyone, including women and children, knew about it. This 22-story skyscraper, the tallest in East Asia, can indeed proudly show off in the Eastern Hemisphere. In fact, a 22-story skyscraper dominates one side in East Asia, but in European and American countries, it is still a short and low building. Haven't you heard that in London, England, and New York, USA, skyscrapers are as high as fifty or sixty stories? So, why is a 22-story skyscraper worth bragging about? Only because it is the first of its kind in the Far East, it gets talked about far and wide.</p>
<p>(2) Why build skyscrapers?</p>
<p>Some say that two or three stories, or even five or six stories, are enough. Why build twenty or thirty stories? You don't know that the population in cities is increasing day by day, and land prices are rising. In busy places, houses stand close together, and there is a disaster of overcrowding. Therefore, landowners have no other way to remedy this except to increase the number of stories in their buildings to meet the needs of residents. Increasing the height of buildings is of great benefit to landowners. Among buildings, high-rise buildings, so-called skyscrapers, are the most economical to build. Building one story has the same land value as building twenty or thirty stories. This is one reason. The higher the building, the more rooms there will be. The rent received will be more than one story. This is the second reason. During construction, the average construction cost per floor is much cheaper than low-rise buildings. This is the third reason. There are other economic advantages, but I won't go into them all here. Understanding this, the construction of skyscrapers can be roughly understood.</p>
<p>(3) The application of skyscrapers</p>
<p>The construction of skyscrapers is economical for landowners to fully utilize the value of their land, and it can also meet the needs of society to avoid the problem of overcrowding. The use of skyscrapers can be for special shopping malls or for residential accommodation. However, there are also special disadvantages. Opening a store, customers find it inconvenient to go up and down. Living in a skyscraper also has the same suffering. Therefore, unless necessary, skyscrapers may not be suitable for general needs. Taking Shanghai as an example, although the population has exceeded three million, there is still plenty of open space, and most of the houses are two or three stories. Therefore, even if there is overcrowding, adding a third or fourth floor to the residence is enough. Looking at the buildings built recently, most of them are already three or four stories. This is also the reason. However, according to the habits of residents, even three or four-story buildings are inconvenient. How much more so for ten stories or more? Although there are elevators, they will not be happy. The unsuitability of skyscrapers for residential use in Shanghai is evident from this. However, they can still be used for special commercial applications.</p>
<p>(4) The foundation of skyscrapers</p>
<p>When building a skyscraper, the first thing we must pay attention to is the softness or hardness of the foundation and how much weight it can bear. If it cannot bear the weight, the foundation will inevitably sink when the building is high. In New York, USA, the underground is all stone, so skyscrapers, even if they are as high as fifty or sixty stories, will not sink. As for Shanghai, the geology is different. It is close to the coast, and the soil is loose. Therefore, for skyscrapers with more than ten stories, the foundation must be particularly strong, otherwise it cannot bear this weight. Therefore, engineers must regard how the foundation can be made particularly strong and able to bear multi-story buildings as a prerequisite before constructing a skyscraper. The foundation is strong, and then construction can proceed.</p>
<p>(5) The construction of skyscrapers</p>
<p>When building a skyscraper, in addition to paying special attention to the foundation, there are many other points that should be paid attention to during construction. For example, the building materials. In order to ensure the durability and load-bearing capacity of the building, all raw materials must be of high quality. After the building is high, the lower floors often lack light. However, if the construction is done properly, it can also be made to have sufficient light everywhere. In addition, the building is high, there must be many rooms and many people living in it. Therefore, if a fire occurs carelessly, it is not easy to extinguish, especially on the upper floors. If it is unfortunately destroyed by fire, the loss is greater than ordinary houses. Therefore, fire prevention equipment must be thorough. In order to make it convenient and quick for residents to go up and down, elevators should be installed more. In addition, high-rise houses are subject to more severe wind and rain. The windows and glass must be shatterproof, and more walkways must be drawn to facilitate access to toilets, etc. There are too many problems to list. Due to space limitations, I cannot describe them all here.</p>
<h3>Architectural Jargon</h3>
<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>丨丨About the Usage in Construction Sites丨丨</p>
<p>In the construction of houses, from the perspective of construction, whether it is the method or the materials used, the names of some places are not easily heard by outsiders. It seems that this is a kind of "slang" specially used in construction sites. Now I will write down some of the common words that should be used:</p>
<p>Leveling Water丨丨 Using a surveying instrument (Transit) on uneven ground, small stakes are driven in. (Called leveling stakes) High and low marks are drawn to prevent the building from tilting during construction.</p>
<p>Applying Lime Lines丨丨 Preliminary procedure, carefully considering the dimensions, openings, etc. of the house style on the drawings, such as courtyards, living rooms, and kitchens, under the supervision of the supervisor, pull each linen thread, and then flick it with lime powder (lime powder) to make it appear on the construction site of the house.</p>
<p>Preparing Mortar丨丨 What is called preparing mortar? This is used when building ordinary street houses or lane houses, and laying three-in-one soil (Lime Concrete) after excavating the wall trench (Trench), because three-in-one soil is a basic procedure in ordinary construction and must be compacted into a solid with a heavy stone hammer. Pouring mortar at that time is like mixing some gelatin into the three-in-one soil. Its composition is one part lime and two parts black sand.</p>
<p>Returning Fire丨丨 After compacting the three-in-one soil, compact it twice back and forth. The second time is called returning fire. This is mostly used by Jiangbei construction workers.</p>
<p>Tightening the Waistband丨丨 Another procedure after compacting the three-in-one soil, sprinkle yellow sand on the surface of the three-in-one soil and compact it with a stone hammer. This means tightening the waistband.</p>
<p>Setting the Footing丨丨 Setting the footing is the work of masons. Generally, when building five-inch or ten-inch walls in buildings, the large square footing is set on the three-in-one soil. (Footing) It is gradually reduced, roughly 20 inches, 25 inches, or 30 inches.</p>
<p>Plumbing the Line丨丨 This is also the work of masons. When building a wall every three or five layers, pull the linen thread tightly into a straight line, and then build one brick after another according to the straight line. This is a method to resist the thickness of the bricks and prevent the collapse of the wall.</p>
<p>Killing Ash丨丨 If the mason's skills are not high, the bricks often do not line up when building a wall. The reason is that they are addicted to not plumbing the line. The remedy is to scrape the mortar thinner in the high places, which is called killing ash. Conversely, in the low places, the mortar is thickened, which is called adding ash.</p>
<p>Filling the Trough丨丨 (Flush) Also known as scraping the trough, the mortar is applied to each layer of bricks.</p>
<p>Pointing丨丨 Means to clean the mortar joints (Pointing).</p>
<p>Eight-tenths Short丨丨 A brick that is two-tenths short is called eight-tenths short.</p>
<p>Broody Hen丨丨 Not the broody hen in animals, but the switch on the hammer used for driving piles. The shape is very similar to that of a broody hen.</p>
<p>Shrinkage丨丨 (Shrink) Wood is easy to shrink when wet and expand when heated. The meaning of shrinkage is like this.</p>
<p>Dotted Line丨丨 (Dotted Line) It is a black line on the drawing that is not used for building the house, but is drawn on the drawing one by one. This is called a dotted line.</p>
<p>Trestle丨丨 Trestle (Trestil) is used to mark the thickness of the dimensions and to support the scaffolding when ramming cement (Cement).</p>
<p>Joint丨丨 Where the wall body and the wall body are connected, inlaid with dog-tooth-like bricks, it is called joint (Bond). It has female (Groove) and male (Toothing) differences.</p>
<p>Rabbet丨丨 The width of the wall body, if the bricks are difficult to match, you can leave some gaps in the middle, this gap is called rabbet (Rebate). (To be continued)</p>
