<p>（華盛頓）美國駐日大使葛魯、星期日向日外相廣田面提之聲明書、巳於今日由國務院公布、該項聲明書明白表示美國反對日本之亞洲門羅主義、亦即美國對於日外省宣言之正式態度、國務總理赫爾於此聲明書中宣稱、關於財政方面或其他方面援助中國、而此類援助苟不違反現行條約、美實無意於事前商諸日本云、國務院今晨將對日文書發表、可見美實單獨行動、而與英無關、蓋以美大使葛魯向廣田外相提出照會之時間爲星期日下午六時（東京時間）、在英外相西門向下院報告此事件巳告一段落前數小時也、美聲明書對於九國公約全體簽字國應盡之條約義務特别重視、美聲明書於此宣稱、美國適當體諒其他國家之權利義務、亦望其他國家適當體諒美國合法利益之權利義務、據美國人民及美國政府之意見、决無一國不得其他關係國之許允、能以一巳之意念、判斷其他獨立自主國家之權利義務及合法利益者、美聲明書續稱、關係國所締結之多邊條約、祗可以關係國之恊定始得予以合法之修正或廢止、美聲明書又稱、美國自身及與他國聯合、繼續實施其睦鄰政策云、美國對日聲明書之公布、更可證明英美於目前不致採取一致行動、至於今後此種行動之可能性、亦須視局勢有何新發展爲定、惟此項聲明書向日外務省提出之前、美國務院官員曾與英法意及九國公約其他簽字國恊商云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務總理赫爾今日發出正式文告、謂駐日大使奉國務院之訓令、於四月二十九日往見日外相廣田、並提出一文、其要旨如下、</p>
<p>「日政府近曾表示其對於日本與他國在華權益之態度、此種表示、出自負責方面、故不能忽略視之、而使美政府遵守美日兩國政府間關係中之坦率習慣者、有重行聲明美國對於所涉及權益問題的地位之必要、美國對華關係、亦猶美國對日反對他國關係、受一般公認的國際公法原則及美國所簽條約規定之支配、美國對華有若干權益與義務、且與中國或日本或中日兩國及若干他國締結關於遠東權益與義務之多邊條約、美國又參加世界各國幾皆加入之一個大的多邊條約、此項條約唯用載明的與承認的或簽約國所議定的手續、始可合法修正之或廢止之、美政府在其國際交際與關係中、欲適當顧慮他國之權與義務及合法利益、而亦期望他國政府對於美國之權與義務及合法利益、亦予以適當之顧慮、美國人民與美國政府之意、以爲任何一國苟未得有關係的他國之同意、不能合法希圖在牽涉其他主權國的權與義務及合法利益之時局中、任意武斷、美政府巳置美國於善鄰政策中、及此政策之實施中、將繼續自己並會同他國政府專致其最好努力於此政策」云、（一日路透電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）此間政界認國務總理赫爾昨日所發關於美國遠東政策之言論、乃美國關於國際關係的原則之一般聲明、此種原則可適用於牽涉條約權益與義務之任何時局、政界不認此爲對日之不友好姿勢、蓋以赫爾言論包括美國不僅對日本、且亦對中國對菲列濱與對「滿洲國」之政策也、（二日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c3">對美聲明　日本保留答覆 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>（東京）廣田外相對四月三十日美國國務卿赫爾之公式聲明、認爲尙可謂係再闡明史汀生主義、廣田外相與外部首腦者商議結果、認爲在不再刺戟美國之程度、有使其明瞭東亞現有狀態、故决再發聲明、刻巳在草擬中、（二日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外務當局對於美國務卿赫爾氏發表之聲明、目下正在愼重研究其内容、查該項聲明並未要求答覆、但倘覺有回答必要時、仍擬設法使用某種形式、以表示日本之意思、亦未可知、外務省則認爲無從速答覆之必要、且以駐美大使齋藤氏將於訂七月内請假歸國、故關於此項問題、將與對美方略同時行使討論也云、（二日日聯電）</p>

<p>（紐約）紐約時報華盛頓訪電稱、國務院對於日本事、未有繼續進行之意、將如英外相西門亦認此事告一段落、國務院希望鼓勵對日親善與友好之精神、如今年三月廣田外相與赫爾總理換文中所表示者、參院外交委員長畢特門聲稱、渠信英美兩國巳以堅强態度保障九國公約之效能云、（二日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）今日英外部因中國公使館之請求、將星期一西門外相在下院所稱日本在華之特殊權利一點、予以正式解釋、外部稱、此點係指滿洲境内之日本鐵路區域及漢口之日本租界而言、外部更表示日本特殊權利一節、另有「爲各國所承認者」一語爲之註解、外交界認外部之解釋甚屬重要、且含有英國繼續承認滿洲爲中國之一部之意、惟此間華人方面仍認英外部之解釋、未能使中國使館方面滿意、並稱、中國使館方面正擬再度詢問、蓋以中國政府並不知有各國所承認之日本在華特殊權利也、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）中國公使郭泰祺今日於路透訪員詢其對於外相西門昨在下院所發言論之意見時答稱、英外相言論大都堪以滿意、惟渠將請其說明「日本有爲他國所公認而爲他國所未享之特殊權益」一句之意義、雖此事現可視爲正式結束、但中國人民對於日本之眞正意思、絕不抱任何幻想、依渠觀之、遠東眞正危險、俄國知之較他國爲詳切、故俄國對此時局甚爲重視、渠信俄國現正竭力鞏固遠東防務云、（一日路透電）</p>

<p>（紐約）紐約通報今日社論對於英外相西門昨在下院所發「爲他國所公認而爲他國所未有之日本特殊權益」一句、表示不滿、謂美國並未承認日本特殊權益、一九二三年美國務總理休士與駐美日大使埴原曾換文取銷不幸言及此種特殊權益之藍辛與石井恊定、日本今後恐將覺美國爲不能坐視日本進行其新政策之唯一國家云、（一日路透電）</p>

<p>（紐約）美國駐東京大使格魯、於四月二十九日面交日本外相廣田之照會、業經國務院正式發表、各報以爲此項照會措詞委婉、然意志堅决、紐約泰晤土報謂美國照會、有兩點令人注意、第一點、卽該照會爲羅斯福政府對中國問題表示見地之第一步、第二點、卽美國政府第一次以巴黎非戰公約爲根據、而作正式表示、華盛頓外交界宣稱、此事現巳認爲結束、紐約民聲論壇報謂三年前、當日本軍隊在滿洲行動時、前國務卿史汀生曾發表宣言、表示反對、（一九三二年一月上旬、其内容係稱美國對於日本佔據滿洲、不能認爲合法、佔據後所樹立之制度、亦不能予以承認、）大爲日本所不滿、此次美國政府致日本之照會、可謂在美日國交上、開一新紀元、據該報所見、羅斯福所採政策、在語言上比較和緩、在行爲上則比較堅决、例如政府决定改革海軍、使之合於現代之需要、命海軍飛機作舊金山與檀香山間之不停留飛行（本年一月十日）、承認蘇俄而不承認「滿洲國」、以及繼續貸欵與中國、皆足表示其側重行動、而不在多言云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）現悉羅斯福總統擬自公共工程基金中、提出五千萬美金、作爲建造潛水艇與驅逐艦之用、此項事實、與在巴拿馬運河區域作大規模海軍演習、以及鄭重凖備研究阿羅忝羣島等、顯係華盛頓方面對於日本聲明之答覆、華盛頓星報稱、遠東事態益發證明海軍部政策之正確、該部現正將海軍集中太平洋面云、（三十日塔斯電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）參議員波拉批評國務總理赫爾之言論、謂渠與赫爾完全同意、此番言論、目前可爲關於中國門戶開放的美國政策之充分說明、將來容有他種發展、視日本有何行動而定、渠希望日本可以美國當此言論之精神接受之、而尊重美國權益云、駐美日大使齋藤與中國公使施博士皆未作批評、（一日路透電）</p>

<p>四月二十五日駐日英國大使來訪廣田外相、並謂因奉其本國政府之訓令、請求將曾經發表之非正式聲明書所稱日本政府之見解、當將英國大使亦說明英國在條約上之立塲、同時又談及左列各條、英國政府因該項聲明、據謂係根據列强在中國之某種行動、爲害及東亞和平與中日國交、或對於中國之保全亦發生疑懼而有所發表、但自英國政策上觀之、當不至發生上項不安之情形、蓋英國在實際上正在廻避上項各種有害之措置也云、</p>
<p>上項談話、係英國大使陳述英國外相之說明、廣田外相乃深佳其意、同時將該項非正式聲明解釋日本之立塲、復將日本在東亞地理上之地位加以說明、謂日本對於維持東亞和平及其秩序、實抱有最大之關心、决非遠方各國所能比、此乃當然之原因云、</p>
<p>廣田外相旣經表明日本政府之立塲、復將前次非正式聲明書之要領通知駐日美國大使、同時又分送至英國駐日大使館、茲錄其該項要領如左、</p>
<p>日本對於中國之獨立性及其利益、决不至加以任何危害、且非但無加害之意、並衷心希望中國之保全及其統一繁榮、而中國之保全及統一繁榮、在主義上當委之於中國本身之自覺及其努力、日本並未抱有危害第三國在中國任何利益之意向、第三國以善意對華通商及經濟上之接洽、實爲中國有利之事業、日本當然歡迎之、蓋日本固維持在中國之門戶開放機會均等主義者、且關於中國現在有效之各項條約、更屬嚴厲遵守者、然日本對於違背東亞和平秩序之任何行動及其任何形式、均不得默視之、蓋日本之於東亞、其地理上之地位亦須顧慮、故對於維持該方面之和平秩序、實抱有最形緊密之關心、是以關於對華問題、倘爲任何第三者不顧上項情形而實行其自己本位之政策有所利用、則日本决不能默然看過也云云、（一日日聯電）</p>

<p>— 延</p>
<p>美政府之對日照會業於日昨由其駐東京大使而遞　田外相。吾人細繹該照會之辭句及其所反映之美政府整個的立塲。頗覺箇中涵義深遠。其所牽涉。實己超越今茲以日方對華聲明書爲對象之單純的外交紛爭。而包含日美雙方直接相關之種種問題。</p>
<p>今姑舍該照會之内容不論。只就其正式提出之一點觀察覺其巳足揭露羅斯福總統執政後一年來對日態度之眞面目而使今日與太平洋有切身利害之各國人士在此方面得一正確之認識。洵爲有益之舉。不寗唯是。吾人鑒於羅氏過去對於遠理時局之靜默。因覺此次突作劃時期的「率直」發言。愈有力量。且抱有最後貫澈其主張之凖備與决心焉。昨前論及日本在聲明書中所採之立塲。必不至取消。至是得一强硬旁證。凡我國人如有因英美秉公執言。而感覺日本業巳軟化者實爲大誤日本而果軟化各國政府知之最稔。華盛頓提出照會。寗非多事。</p>
<p>吾人試爲羅斯福設身處地。便知此次對日照會己極盡修辭之能事。然其内容。决非僅限於對日消極的抗議。而實含有積極的警告性。聞日本廣田外相對此照會。認爲係再度闡明史汀生主義。可謂一針見血之談。照會中同時提及非戰公約及華會所訂各條約。并有「美國政府之立塲亦有再次確言之必要」（據日聯社譯文）一語。其所稱之立塲。當然係指胡佛史汀生執政時代之立塲言。所謂胡佛主義或史汀生主義。固爲此立塲之結晶而含有積極性者也。論該積極性之具體的說明。則爲（一）非戰公約訂立後世界不當有戰爭。如有戰爭。必將世界劃爲兩大交戰集團無所謂局外中立隱示美國最後有參戰可能。（二）華盛頓會議時所訂各條約。其締結前之情勢與締結後之影響。皆帶有連環性。日本破壞九國條約。美國縱不能迅速取締日本亦不當預望美國永受海軍條約之束縛隱示美國當以擴充海軍力爲手段而維持太平洋上業巳破壞之均勢。此次照會原文論及中日美與其他某某國家間之多邊的條約。係用Ｔｒｅａｔｊｅｓ一字義屬多數其不限於九國公約一項巳極明顯。由是而預測在明年舉行華盛頓第二屆海軍會議討論修改倫敦海軍公約時日美兩國必起重大爭執而其　結必在日美或日美英海軍比率問題應否受「九一八」後遠東局面變動之影響一點廣田渴欲將屆時之討</p>
<p>論議題專限於海軍軍縮問題。而將遠東問題除外無非欲避免在國際會議中討論中日懸案之形式羅斯福巳乘機予以拒絕之答覆矣不知我國當局對此有切身利害之關鍵。亦曾作積極應付之凖備否</p>
<p>再者。與此次照會之提出。具有連帶關係者二事値得注意其一爲美國行政部與立法部態度之默契其二爲提出前美國務院曾與英法意及九國公約其他簽字國恊商。（日本當然除外）就前者言。自日本聲明發表後與美總統分握外交實權之參議院之中堅份子。如波拉羅濱遜金氏等皆有公之表示。頗足影響輿論。而使羅斯福在國内外之立塲加强就後者言此次照會雖由美國單獨提出。至少巳得其他七締約國當局精神上之贊助吾人在日前著論曾謂召集九國條約會議之時機業巳成熟此項會議日本必參加固在意中。然我國條約權利及義務所在。總不能放棄不然自身恐卽不免於違約之嫌。遑論其他。須知此爲各締約國應盡之責在我國旣無所謂乞憐在各國亦無所謂示惠。此又吾人在注意美國照會之餘連帶而得之感想應爲我當局告者也。</p>
<p>今羅斯福之對日態度巳極明瞭。蘇聯之對日備戰　趨急進國聯行政院會議及顧問會議行將在半閱月内開會。討論遠東時局而去明年第二屆華盛頓海軍會議之時期。亦日益接近。凡此種種。悉與日本發生切身之利害而其國當局所能見到之解决或應付方案。竟無一不在急速壓迫中國一事中求之。誠堪痛惜。最近日本外務省廣田重光有吉三頭會議緊隨美國照會之後而决定以直接交涉方式迅速解决中日懸案而其軍部之侵略方策又有由華北而蔓延於華南之勢。足見事態巳萬分嚴重我國民乎亡國之慘禍巳臨頭矣。其可好整以暇。而視若無覩耶。</p>

<p>主席報告畢、卽由市黨部代表陸京士演說、略謂、今日爲五一節、凡全國乃至全世界之工友、均於是日作盛大之紀念大會、因五一節是工友從非人生活中轉變到人的生活之一天、過去世界各</p>
<p>國工人之生活、與中國目前生活相同、首由美國工人之自覺、起而作有力之示威、於是三八制乃得實行、并逐漸推行於全世界、是以五一節一方面使世界之工人運動充分的發展、另方面亦將中國之勞働運動推動、本人對於中國之工人運動、略有意見、在此加以申述、共產黨以工人無祖國一言誘惑工人、但我人觀於蘇聯之工友、在八小時工作之餘、另增加二小時、爲國家的國防建設上和生產建設加緊工作、其他如德法英日諸國、更有甚於此者、則我工人在此國際風雲緊張之際、國難又危急至此、當更應爲國家去努力、最後本人提出二點具體意見、（一）我人希望今後應於最短期内、達到全市工人均能享受八小時之敎育的機會、目前由市黨部及總工會雖巳設立勞工學校二十餘所、但以全市工人之衆、尙不敷分配而以本市工人之尙多缺乏智識、此事實應於最短期内、促其實現、（二）我人旣明白中國一切產業落後的原因、由於帝國主義侵略的結果、則凡我工友均應爲復興民族之立意上、加緊生產、團結力量、抵禦外侮、如是則國貨可與外貨相競爭、國貨之得暢銷、卽工業有發展之望、而工人生活之改善、亦必可達到目的矣、</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>他們只要不見車上有一個人私自坐下，-包括那在煤堆上鏟煤的丁火夫-也没有一個司閘夫私自在這些黃色，的車頂上走動，他們的任務便自以爲完滿了。可是，就祗這樣一些很筒單的任務，他們也巳累得够了；因爲他們必須時刻不離的監察着，而且又不能坐下去。</p>
<p>這裏，讓我再告訴你們幾段比較詳細的情形。�</p>
<p>孟福祥當然也有一兩個重要的助理人員，雖然他自己根本一事不辦，將敎這些助理人員何從助理起呢？但他旣是一個比較重要的高級官員，照例總得有幾個助理的人。而這些助理他的人，也另有助理人帶着。所以他們一羣是很多的。這種情形，在滿淸的官塲中巳成了幾百年來無可轉變的習慣了。每當一個人得到了一個可以弄大錢的官職之後，他照例必須將他戚族中所有的男性，一起帶去，讓他們分踞各個重要的助理人員的位置。所以，如果要望這些人拿了錢眞能替國家或人民辦些事情，那眞和要雄雞生蛋一般的不可能了！</p>

<p>他所做的事情，却只是銀錢的進出而巳。雖然在表面上他是皇太后委派的，但是如果有人抓住了總管太監李蓮英，用凶猛的刑罰，勒逼他說實話，我們就可以知道孟福祥的位置，完全是他化了鉅額的運動費，向李蓮英買下來的。（二四）</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>二三日來，或溜　於馬路，或白相於公園，或「敬備茶點」，邀女朋友作切身的考察，對於女人的用途，心得不少。</p>
<p>一天，天氣甚好，公園中照相少爺多得很，夫死扳扳的樹，呆木木的石頭，</p>
<p>旣没曲綫美，又乏迷人勢，故帶照相機者，必帶女人，或坐而笑，臥而喜，抬頭看雲，低首剝芝蔴香蕉之類·都可拍成照片，姿態天生，非樹與石頭等死東西所能及其萬一，「如果天下無女人，亦决無照相機的發明」度之以理，可以相信。</p>
<p>一天，下酒無菜，就去買一百釧四川榨菜，攤在桌上，且飲且哼「桃花江是美人窩：二房東女兒不知是聞歌聲而來？還是臭到酒氣而來，「這包榨菜幾鈿？」，「一百鈿！」，「我去買只要五十鈿，」就給伊五個銅子再買一包來，果然「有過之而無不及」，至此，余恍然而呼曰：「願天下「便宜」盡屬女人」。</p>
<p>又一天，穿上竹布掛子赴ＸＸ母校看遊藝會，被阻於收票處，「我是老校友！」「不認識」請校長出來認，」「嘿！架子倒不小」他們就理也不理了，一刻，來女學生三人，隨男子二，西裝革履之流也，「這兩位先生的票子，」「做鬼，」女學生瞇瞇眼睛說。收票的又說：「公事公辦」「弗關，弗關，」－三女二男一擁而進，我徒望校門興嘆而巳。</p>
<p>以上雖事之小者，然非「女人」之「用途」而何？</p>
<p>「女人之爲用誠大矣哉！」</p>

<p>一種因緣，我有義烏之行。你們或許不曉得這個浙江省蕞爾的小縣，那我得加說明，它在杭江路中段，歷史上的宗澤和駱賓王兩位忠藎謀國的人物便產生在那裏。</p>
<p>我在杭州西興那邊，搭午後六時的第三次快車，於十二時到達義烏。要花去六個鐘點，要在車中枯坐一晝夜四分之一的時間。但我此次並不在車中打呵欠，而沉沉思睡。這原因，我徼倖地得到了幾個旅行的伴侶，那幾個穉氣的大小孩，那一排穉氣而又和氣的兵。他們會哼小曲，會嘻嘻哈哈地說蠢話，不但娛樂了自己，也娛樂了人家，他們本身就是藝術。</p>
<p>藝術的產生就在那一羣没有受過敎育而頭腦簡單得不能耐煩地去思索那不可知的將來的人的身邊。大學敎授反對將黃包車夫寫入小說，唯美的藝術家主張在蛇一樣擺動身段的女人身邊發現藝術，我想有些錯誤。朋友，這一排小兵，他們不知自己就是幾十枚肉彈，他們不願推測他們的生命的結局以及葬身所在的地方，如有一位文學家用筆刺破他們的心理，曲曲傳達出來，做一篇小說，其價値將不在屠格浬夫的「獵人日記」以下。</p>
<p>感謝小兵，他們做了我旅行的伴侶，引導著我的藝術的觀點到人生之另一方面了。</p>

<p>第二十八回巧合共觀塲痴情拾帕　　殷勤兩問疾誤會投書</p>
<p>江氏在一邊聽着，對於事情全明白了，就笑着答應一聲道：是的，老太爺，您爲人也就和戲臺上這個天官差不多。趙翁笑着搖了兩搖頭道：那怎樣比得？江氏笑道：怎樣比不得？您待兒媳婦的那一番週到，也許比這個天官還好呢。他如此說着，桂枝就也跟着這話音，掉過頭來向趙翁笑了一笑。他這樣掉過頭來，正好同積之打了一個照面。他這一笑，儘管不是對積之而發，然而積之看到這種情形，不由得心裏不蕩漾起來。他自己明白，人家的公公和母親在這裏，自己决不要胡思亂想，於是直着視綫，只管向臺上看了去。不過他的眼睛雖看着臺上，他的鼻子，却是四處八方的氣味，都可以聞到的。在他這樣沉住了氣，只管向臺上呆看的時候，却有一陣陣的香氣，不斷的向鼻子裏面送了來。這香氣襲撃得久了，積之向前看看，都是藍布衣服的男子，後面雖有兩個女人，黑油頭，白粉臉，俗得令人作嘔，他們身上，也不會送出香氣來的。談到身邊，一定就是桂枝身上的香氣。桂枝臉上，雖也淡淡的摸了一些脂粉，不見得上品，照說是不應當有香氣放出來的。那麽？這香氣是從何而來呢？積之在這樣發生着疑問的時候，眼睛斜着，向桂枝身上看去。不過那也是很快的一瞬之間，他總怕爲了自己的態度不端莊，惹得兩位老人家不高興。其實兩位老人家，不見得有什麽感覺，却是桂枝心　暗中找急。心想怎麽這樣大意，和他緊緊的坐着，他只管把眼珠睃來睃去，别讓老太爺看到了這種行動（三七五一）</p>

<p>「走！老東西！」孩子們常在不快樂的時候，打一下，踢一脚，發洩他們的苦悶，唉！兩年前那一個敢這樣的欺侮它呢？</p>
<p>一天，阿淸瘋狂似的進來，在我坐位前後打轉，嘴裏是尖聲的吠呌。</p>
<p>「什麽事？阿淸！」</p>
<p>它似乎聽得懂的，霍地轉了個身，舉起了他的背脊，我發現他受了創傷，在他的背上巳缺少了一大塊的毛，鮮紅的肉，完全呈露，血液一滴滴的滴着。</p>

<p>我在家鄉報紙上，看見了某君一首詩，上兩句巳經忘掉，三四句我還記得是「王四酒家風味好，黃鷄白酒嫩菠靑。」對於王四酒家，推許很爲得當。不差，在暮春三月，江南草長的時候，嚐嚐山肴野　，飲飲鄉村新釀，多麽够味，人生難得幾回春，不妨去樂上一樂，嚐一嚐鄉村風味吧！</p>

<p>— 仰莾</p>
<p>西北是大家知道富源藴藏的區域，可是還没有知道是外貨暢銷的地方。所以凡是到過西北的，都說可憐的西北民衆，大部分還没有知道許多日用所需，巳有國貨的出品。聽說西北地方，還是用的銅面盆，木面盆，還是吃的英美香烟，用的獅子牌金剛石牙粉，還是穿的花旗布，洗的祥茂肥皂，總而言之，不是十足的土地貨，便是完全的洋貨。如果講給他們國貨的出品，他們總是不信，以爲中國貨决没有這樣進步的。郭君維屏，數次往來西北與上海，見到這種情形，因而竭力勸我上海國貨廠商前往西北各地舉行國貨展覽會，大家一致贊成，最近郭君會同滬廠代表趙秉仁，前往開封，鄭州，洛陽，西安，蘭州各地，接洽結果，極爲美滿。最近上海廠商都要聯袂的往西北去，舉行流動式的國貨展覽，把這裏很多很好的出品，深入西北民間，以引起其購買的心理，喜歡國貨的信心。尤其是在宋子文先生從事西北開發的時間，可以得到不少的便利。往西北去，向來不過一種口號，現在居然從國貨界先事實現，這更足以顯出國貨界的勇氣，記者所希望的：</p>
<p>第一，往西北時，勿僅僅展覽，便以爲畢其能事，要深入民間，切實調查其嗜好　習俗，何者應銷，何者不合需用，要多多的訪問觀察，大槪在展覽所用　時間以外，一半時間，要費在調查部分。</p>
<p>第二，要多和當地批發商聯絡，予以種種的便利，减少他們的疑忌，得到</p>
<p>他們的同情，否則結了惡感，反生阻力。</p>
<p>第三，在内地展覽時，最好要有多方面的活動，如銀行，如學校，如官廰，如社會團體，都要和他們接洽談話，使他們有澈底的認識，然後才能爲實力的帮忙。</p>
<p>西北去，是一件很有趣的事，同時也是一件很費經營很煩心的事。</p>

<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今年是各團體公定的婦女國貨年，凡是全國的婦女，不論老幼，不論太太，奶奶，小姐，女學生，·····都應該起來服用國貨，宣傳國貨，使國貨運動，經婦女的提倡，領導宣傳，服用，而得到一個極大的效果，一方面替國貨的出路，打出一條新生命，同時，也是替一般的婦女，洗滌那「女子是洋貨的推銷員」的奇恥大辱。</p>
<p>婦女的本身，在今年一年之中，固然應該極力的來服用國貨，但是一般婦女的丈夫，我想，恐怕仍有許多迷醉於洋貨，不肯切切實實的來服用國貨吧！</p>
<p>一個愛國家，愛民　，愛丈夫的婦女，遇到子這種丈夫，應該怎樣辦？用什麽方法，使自巳的丈夫，肯死心塌地的服用國貨，不再去購買洋？理在的幾項辦法，便是我所要貢獻出來的，愛用國貨的主婦，碰着不愛用國貨的丈夫，大可以如法泡製，雖不能說是萬應丹，但至少可以收到極大的效果：</p>
<p>（一）當丈夫購置東西回家時，如係外貨，可拒絕使用。</p>
<p>（二）當丈夫購置東西回來時，你可以說：一東西是不錯，可惜錢却被外國人侵奪去了！」</p>
<p>○當丈夫要購買東西而和你商量時，你可以勸他購用國貨，並說明　用國貨優點。</p>
<p>丈夫經過你勸　後，仍購買外貨着，你可以拒絕他的要求。</p>
<p>諸位主婦們，「婦爲悅己者容」一個賢明而得丈夫信任的主婦，如果丈夫購買外貨時，照上面的辦法做去，一定可以勝利。</p>
<h3 id="c236">婦女們！醒吧！ <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>婦女們！你們還没有買舶來品時，你應該自己相一想。</p>
<p>你所要買的東西，有國貨的，你爲什麽不買國貨呢。你甘做外國人的奴隸嗎？你情願你的子孫做外國人的奴隸嗎？你也許以爲買幾元錢幾角錢甚至幾分錢的外國貨不要緊嗎？這你完全錯了，你每天要念幾有名句：「外國的經濟侵略每年十二萬萬元以上」。因爲你有國貨而不買，國貨事業就要完全破產了。中國貨廠全都建在中國人的身上，中國人不買，誰來買呢？你應該指導你的孩子，走入國貨之路，他們都是中國的主人翁呀！</p>
<p>你所買的東西，没有國貨的，應該節用，尤不應該浪用。你看見别人穿最時式的衣服，你應該低聲問問自己，那都是替外國人做義務廣告呀！如果那東西是切迫的，好似醫藥的用品等，你應該選擇價較廉的，但是並不是仇貨。�</p>
<p>婦女們！不要再睡眠了，那國内經濟的外流巳搖撼了國家的國貨生計的我們負指導的責任，在這婦女國貨年中，讓我們幹一下啊！</p>

<p>— 朱枕木</p>
<p>溯自銀價高漲之消息，自黃金國傳出之後，近日來吾國朝野遠識高明之士，巳有不少討論，主張各異，而恐慌之程度，其實皆同，然吾國人民茫茫懂懂，春睡未醒者，正復多多，貪小之心，熟又無之，良以銀價果然高漲，外匯一定便宜，一般摩登仕女，太太小姐，買辦跑街之賣買舶來貨品，必乘此便宜機會，大行活動，蓋往時之洋貨價値一元者現可賤至七八折以下，亦卽昔日之一元可買四件者，現可購得五件矣，便宜，便宜，誠然便宜弗少。雖然，記者有言矣，吾人之購買洋貨，貪圖一時便宜，以自己有限之現銀，拚命送出，去換得人家過賸之產物，待到將來，現銀完</p>
<p>全流出，盡入洋人手中，於是農村之經濟，週轉不靈，銀行之基金流動不得内庫空虚，信用破產，市面凋零，百業倒閉，以至紙幣折兌，農產跌價，鈔票一元者，其實値得八角，穀子二元者，或許只得塊半，無形之中，將吾人之資產，損失三分之一，是則一例，其實或過於此，甚至半數以下，亦未可卜，如是則暗虧之處，定可預知，而又豈是吾人今日貪得之小小便宜，所能得償者！現在美國爲欲推銷其過賸之存貨，爲增闢其在吾國之市塲計，提高銀價，藉增吾人之購買力，是爲彼勢所必行之事，各爲利害，豈能中止哉，而白銀協定之批准，對此亦無甚大效，至吾國政府方面之限止現銀出口，是雖良法，然彼國可將所有現銀，封存吾國之外商銀行中，面另行轉賬，是則等於彼國之財產，無運銀出口之名，而有外流之實，是仍無效，不觀乎上海外商銀行現今所存銀數，巳達二萬七千餘萬元之鉅，而上海全埠存銀，不過五萬六千餘萬元，卽全國而論，亦僅十二三萬萬元之數，是則至今日止，現銀之入外商手中者巳佔上海全埠之半數，而將及全國總數之四分之一矣，嗣後，若再經銀價高漲，外匯便宜，助以國人之貪圖小利，購買洋貨，任其現銀之外流，吾恐其禍患之來也不遠矣，是而不醒，更將何以自救哉！讀者有　於此，則雖彼美國通過銀價提高，國府之批准白銀恊定，海關之不禁現銀出口，只須全國人民，人人弗買洋貨，遵照新生活行動，一體服用國貨，則彼亦只能徒呼負負，其能奈何吾哉，欲吾同胞，注意留心，救國拯亡，其在斯乎！</p>

<p>— 張延祥</p>
<p>我國關稅早經政府明令宣佈自主，惟於國内腹地中心之漢口，則仍未能獲得自主關稅之利益，仍受其害，而致日趨没落。貨物由鐵路運輸，可不納關稅，由長江運輸，則國貨進出，均須納稅，洋貨進出，均不納稅。水運自比陸運爲便宜，故漢口國貨市塲，决不能與洋貨競爭，蓋國貨須付高價運費，或二重關稅也。依關稅制度觀察，漢口之將來，不能受粤漢鐵路通車之利益，僅爲平漢及粤漢兩路之一聯運點，而經過此聯運點者，亦僅少數貨物互相交換耳。</p>
<p>以故爲我國國貨計，爲漢口市塲計，爲全國工商業計，漢口應建設爲一國内之自由市，（此處所稱漢口，依江漢關管轄區之廣義言。）凡國貨從漢的運往國内任何口岸，漢口及到達口岸，均免徵關稅，又凡國貨從國内任何口岸運到漢口，其起運口岸及漢口亦均負徵關稅，而洋貨凡未經我國任何海關徵稅者，到達漢口，或經漢口起運，照章仍須納稅，余所謂之國内自由市，係對内而言之自由市，原來在國内運輸國貨，尙不自由，則可絕對不必談提倡國貨矣。　　余知吾國中央財政之狀况，余知海關制度之歷史，余知稅收爲公債之基金，余知外交條約之束縳，惟觀察我國國貨之前途，華中工商業之地位，與漢口市塲之復榮，則以爲漢口必須建設爲國内自由市，庶將來可並駕於香港之自由市，又芝加哥之第二大城，至其實行步驟，以及解除各種困難方法，則有待各界之討論焉。（完）</p>

<p>— 敷禮</p>
<p>年紅燈，這幾年來在上海確是普遍極了，無論電影院，跳舞塲，　同各商店，都巳有了它的足跡，因爲它富有美麗而引人的光彩，在現今的二十世紀的都會裝飾中，它確巳占據了一個相當的地位。記者昨天承老友謝君的介紹，得參觀國人自辦的東方年紅電光公司公廠，歸後便拉雜將見聞所得記誌於後。</p>
<p>據謝君云，該廠成立在民國十九年夏，先設廠在閘北實山路，後因一二八戰爭，以致全廠被焚，損失甚大，經理爲張惠康君，原爲一熱心國貨提倡者。現又爲中國國貨公司之董事，並亞光電木公司的經理，所以自東方工廠被毁後，卽在靜安寺路設廠，繼續營業。現於廠内並另設試騐部，聘請工程師黃文治君主持廠内一切，黃君爲交通大學畢業，學識經騐，俱甚豐富。聞近巳有玻璃儀器一種，巳經黃君試騐成功。在不久</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>以後，該廠當能自製出品，而挽回利權，亦國貨年中一好消息也。</p>
<p>該廠製造年紅燈所用之原料，除年紅氣，橡皮綫，國人尙無自製外，餘均皆用國貨，如玻璃管，變壓器等。廠内共分六部，爲灣管，抽氣，製燈頭，放樣，油漆，同行電綫等。工人約計五十餘人，而以灣管，抽氣，爲最煩重。故該二部工人，均爲深有經騐之技師。灣管者，以長約五尺許之玻璃管，在自來火中燒之使軟，而照樣子徐徐灣之，並以口吹使胖，玻璃管有黃，淡黃，白，三種。黃者爲作綠色，黃色燈之用。淡黃者爲作淡綠色燈之用。白者爲作藍色，紅色燈之用。管之粗細亦分數種，而以字之大小爲定。該部工作，夏日尤較吃力，因在火旁工作，又不能開窗通風，因風之吹動，有碍工人，夏日炎炎，宜其苦矣。聞該廠有定例，凡炎熱至寒暑表九十四度以上，在中午得停工一小時，亦以體諒工友也。抽氣工作，較灣管爲舒適，祗將灣成之字管，接於抽氣機上，抽去管内空氣，使其眞空，以强力之變壓器使字管發熱，然後加進定量</p>
<p>，在另外之變壓器上點數小時後，卽成光彩奪目之各色年紅燈矣。</p>
<p>餘如製燈頭，放樣，油漆，行電綫等，工人數十，穿公司所供給之制服，整齊一式，勤於工作，使予深佩該廠管理之得法，勞資融合，前途無限，故作此參觀記。</p>

<p>— 盧荻</p>
<p>今日吾國之大患，夫人盡知爲民窮財盡，然所以告成此民窮財盡之原因果安在乎？一言以蔽之，由於列强商業經濟侵略之結果而巳。在昔人多愓然於列强武力侵略之足以亡國，蓋其心目中猶隱然有斷脰裂腸之慘禍存焉；而今於商業經濟之足以亡國，則習而安之，恬然不以爲意。鳴呼，孰知此敲骨吸髓的慢性痛苦，迺更有甚於一刹那間斷脰裂腸之慘禍哉？</p>
<p>夫吾國國貨業之最大勁敵，厥惟日本。而近日日本陳米，棉布，火柴，玩具乃至運動器具等之大規模的傾銷，更有排山倒海之勢。苟吾人不謀對策，則亡國之禍，迫近眉睫矣。本篇之目的，卽所以先探討近日日貨傾銷之原因，然後謀其對策也。</p>
<p>日貨傾銷吾國，本非新鮮之事，自廿世紀初彼國產業發展，從被壓迫民族搖身一變而爲帝國主義者時，卽巳有之。惟最近日貨傾銷，蓋有其特殊原因在，茲述說若次。</p>
<p>（一）輸出貿易之補償　日本對華輸出，素稱順利，一九二五年竟佔我國貿易總額約三分之一，一九三零年亦佔三分之一。易言之，卽久巳佔居第一把交椅。惟是年以降，卽呈不振，迨乎東省事變與滬戰後，吾國抵貨甚力，日本對華貿易日漸　微，迨乎去年，巳降至第四位，爲英，美，澳　及。以工商立國之日本，貿易義落實爲致命之傷。宜乎其最近拚命傾銷，以謀捲土重來矣。</p>
<p>（二）財政赤字之危機　財政爲一國經濟景氣之指標，試觀日本今年度歲出竟達二十九億元，與歲入不相抵者數億元</p>
<p>。救濟赤字之策，公債本爲最佳手段。惟日本之公債，去年爲七億元，今年增至九億元，事實上社會能否擔負，實屬疑問。苟致力謀對外貿易之發展，使其國經濟恐慌轉嫁於他國，此非日本舉國上下所夢想者乎？</p>
<p>（三）經濟布洛克之對立　現經濟布洛克之劃分，巳爲最明顯之事。日本之對外貿易，除吾國外，當推南美印度爲最工。今日印會商大不利於日本，南美亦爲羅斯福一手攫去，頑强如日本者，亦不能不徒呼荷荷。茲有一國焉，其距離也綦近，其需要廉價商品也孔殷，其抵抗外貨進口之武器也蕩然無有。且此逐鹿之塲，尙未爲其他列强劃入其「布洛克」之範圍，此非日貨之桃花源乎？</p>

<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>因爲西方現代文化是有自然活潑的人生觀，是經過十九世紀浪漫潮流解放過，所以現代西洋文化是比較容忍比較近情的。我倒認爲這是西方民族精神健全之徵象。在中國新文化雖經提倡，却未經過幾十年浪漫潮流之陶鍊，人之心靈仍是苦悶，人之思想仍是乾燥。一有危艱，大家轟轟然一陣花砲，五分鐘後就如曇花一現而消滅，因爲人之心　根本不健全，樂與苦之間失了調劑。呌苦固然看來比嘻笑或間適認眞愛國，無奈呌苦了喉乾舌燥，這一股氣旣然接不上去，呌苦之後就是沉寂，宛如小孩哭後想睡眠。雖然偶然在沉寂中哼喞一兩聲，也是病楊呻吟，酸腐頽喪，疲靡之音。現在文學中好像就没聽見聲音宏亮的喊聲，只有躱在黑地放幾根冷箭罷了。但人之心理，總是自以爲是，所以有吮　之癖。自己萎弱，惡人健全，自己惡動，忌人活潑，自己飲水，嫉人喝茶，自己呻吟，恨人笑聲，總是心地欠寛大所致。二千年來方巾氣仍舊把二十世紀的白話文人壓得不能喘氣。結果文學上也只聽見嗡嗡而巳。</p>
<p>所謂西洋自然活潑的人生觀，可舉新例說明。　如遊玩是自然的，以前儒塾就禁止小孩遊玩，近來敎育觀念解放了，近乎自然了，於是不但不禁遊玩，並且在幼稚　，小學，中學利用遊玩養兒童的德性。西洋夫婦卿卿我我，携手同遊，也不過承認男女之樂爲人類所應有，不必矯飾。於是慨然携手同行於街上，忝不爲怪。由中國人看來，也只能暗羨洋鬼子會享艷福。一旦中國人也男女解放起來，却認爲不可，說是傷風敗俗。看見西人男女祼身海浴水戲，雖然也會羨慕，但是看見中國男女祼身海浴，必登時駡其爲世風不古。西洋女子服裝儘管妖艷，西洋現代的批評，却没見有人說她們是有傷風化，因爲他們巳有浪漫派容忍　點。然在中國看見西洋女子妖裝艷服，雖然佩服，看見中國女子一樣的服裝，便要　其爲摩登。西洋舞台跳舞，如草裙舞，妖邪比中國何只百倍，但是未聞西方思想家評撃，而實　上西人也並未因看草裙舞而遂忘了愛國，中國人却不能容忍草裙舞，板起道學面孔，詈爲人心大變天下大亂之徵，然而中國人也並不因生活之嚴肅而道德高上國家富强起來。全國佈滿了一種陰森發霉處僞迂腐之氣而巳。所以這種方巾氣的批評家雖自己受壓迫而哼幾聲，唾駡「文化統一」，哀怨「新聞檢查」，自己一旦做起新聞檢查員來，才會壓迫人家的利害。我看見女兒見兩隻臭蟲在床板上爭辯，甲駡乙「你是臭蟲！」，乙也回駡甲「你是臭蟲！」我却躱在旁邊胡盧大笑。</p>
<p>因爲心靈根本不健全，生活上少了向上的勇氣，所以方巾氣的批評，也只善摧殘。對捉倡西方自然活潑的人生觀，也只能詆毁，不能建樹。對論語批評曰「中國無幽默」。中國若早有幽默，何必辦論語來提倡？在旁邊喊「中國無幽默」並不會使幽默的根芽逐漸發揚光大。况且論語卽使没有幽默的成功作品，却至少改過國人對於幽默的態度，除非初出芽廬小子，還在注意宇宙及救國「大道」，都對於幽默加一層的認識，只有一些一知半解似通非通的人，還未能接受西方文化對幽默的態度。這種消極摧殘的批評，名爲提倡西方文化實是障碍西方文化，而且自身就不會有結實的成績。人間世出版，動起杭育杭育派的方巾氣，七手八脚，亂吹亂描，却絲毫没有打動了人間世。連一篇像樣的對人間世的内容及編法的批評，足供我虚心採擇的也没有。例如我自己認爲第一期談花樹春光遊記文字太多不滿之處，就没有人指出。總而言之，没有一篇我認爲够得上批評人間世的文字。只有胡魯一篇攻撃周作人詩，是批評内容，但也就淺薄的可笑，只攻撃私人而巳。人間世之錯何在，吾知之　。用倣宋字太古雅。這在主巾氣的批評家，是一種不可原諒的罪案。</p>
<p>編者附記：關於幽默等等的論戰，倘再開展下去，恐將與「幽默」相去便遠，擬就此收塲大吉。</p>
<h3 id="c268">爲己和爲人 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 石髮</p>
<p>小說家寫小說，藝術家成就藝術，品最先是以自己爲中心，抱定一種「天上地下唯我獨尊」的態度，眞覺到天崩地坼不足移動我之錘鑿或畫筆，而且除了我這麽將一己的功力完全發表後，世界便要到末日似以。這麽，方能有偉大的創作。</p>
<p>一到爲社會作事業，提倡一種思想或指導靑年，方法便完全不同了，這幾乎完全是爲人！爲人雖然不能無我，然處處是要替旁人，社會，人類着想，也就値得考慮現狀，顧及將來，和表現的方法。</p>
<p>看來今日許多大人物，似乎都未曾注意到這一層。也許在混亂中，不曾自覺自己的影響和力量，一句話說出之後，所動者極微，如車軸，而所推及的動作便大了，如車輪。某先生曾說過一方面在圓心中轉，一方面在圓周上跟，永遠奔忙，白費氣力而無所歸，那比喻倒是確切的。</p>
<p>若干年靑年的氣力有許多眞白費了，跟着大人先生喊口號奔忙，結果往往領袖們落得一個今日之我與昨日本之我戰，至多輕輕認錯，而「蒼生」便遭殃了，流血伏屍。那過錯，是以前純粹憑感情作用表現自己去了，現在又竭力彌補，以何彌補得？而今日之我與明日之我也許又戰哩，所以狀况也更危險！</p>
<p>所昔日本洋化，今日復古，前之革命，後之拜佛，急速的反覆和沿洄中，犧牲便不可勝言。一直到許多領袖漸漸到了老年，學識比現在豐富了，心氣也和平了，回想當日之所行所爲，當暗自呌聲「慚慚」·</p>
<p>新興的領袖也許很多吧，無論提倡一種什麽，對於這時代的現狀，將來的影響，是値得顧及的；其始作也簡，其將畢也鉅，後面有無情的歷史和始料所不及的事實，要加以精密的考慮才行！</p>
<h3 id="c269">隨筆與小說 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>隨筆與小說是兩種不同的文學的樣式（ＧｅｎｒｅＬｉｔｅｒａｉｒｅ）。於兩者之間的中性的東西，當然，是多少存在着的。然而，兩者的區别，是顯然可見的。　　這兩種相不同的文學樣式，是互相有交涉的。「河水不犯井水」的事，天底下實在少得很。但是，其發生時（Ｏｒｉｇｉｎ）的社會基礎是不同的。而，那是指Ｇｅｎｒｅ之發生而言。並不是說，及其後，寫散文隨筆的，說一定完全是士大丈層，而寫小說的，就一定完全是市民層。不過，在隨筆敝文之中，反映着有閑者的意　的，　是占多數。爲什麽在爲Ｇｅｎｔ　ｅｎａ　的英國作家之中，散文隨筆能够多量地　生出來呢？　　　　扎克，左拉，福羅貝爾諸市民的現實主義者，則不大寫散文隨筆呢？這是我們所不能不從樣式與社會生活之關係上去研求的了。</p>
<p>我以爲，這兩種不同的樣式應當獨立地去找自巳的發展的前途的。如果像徐慰庸先生所說的那樣，「生活充實的作家」「以摶獅子之力去寫散文隨筆，」毫不待言地，散文隨筆是會有其偉大的前途了。不過，那樣的作家，是不是只是極少數呢？是不是有的散文隨筆作家，因爲别的方面走不通，而到散文隨筆是去找遁路呢？「小說之隨筆化」底傾向，其中是　着退避的要素的。生活充實之追求，是解决這　退避的傾向之根本　法，自不待言。不過，</p>
<h3 id="c270">論著作（二） <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>章太炎先生謂：「凡立論欲其本名家，不欲其本縱横。需言不勝而取給於氣矜，游　怒特，蹂稼踐蔬，卒之數篇之中，自爲錯悟；古之人無有也。」「種著作，分之則爲數篇，合之就只是一篇，自有一個井然的系統。司馬遷史記分爲本紀世家列傳書表五項，以本紀表爲經，以世家列傳　爲　，經緯相成，混然一篇大文章。莊子逍遙遊齊物論養生主三篇，合而觀之，也只是一篇大文章。大文章難於組織，古往今來，配得上著作之稱的，先秦諸子而外，只有王充論衡，劉　文心　龍，劉知幾史通，章學誠文史通義那麽寥寥幾種。現代著作界顯得格外貧乏，也可見一般組織能力的薄弱！</p>
<p>顧亭林自謂平生讀書，有所得，輒記之；其有不合，時復改定；或古人先我而有者，則遂削之。「古人先我而有，則遂削之。」就是說没有卓特的見地，不能自成一家言，便没有著作之必要。近人有中國文學史，五花八門，出版了幾十種。我們若要着律寫文學史，且看别人的文學史整理的成績如何，若是自己的意見和他們全然相同，便不必下筆；若是大部分相同，小部分相　，只要　某某文學史箋異」就够了。魯迅先生在廣州講演「魏晋鳳度及文章與藥及酒之關係」，開塲便舉出劉師培的中古文學史，說：「倘若劉先生的書裏巳詳的，我就略」點；反之，劉先生所略的，我就較詳一點。」彼詳此略，相互發明，可說是最通達的辦法。此法一行，坊閒那些千篇一律的文學史可以廢其大半了。</p>
<p>前人常爲古書作註，註解也是著作。劉孝標註世說新語，與臨川原靑相爲輔翼；裴松之註陳壽三國志，「壽所不載，事宜存錄者則罔不畢取，以補其閥。或同說一事而辭有乖雜。或事出本異而疑不能判，並皆鈔納以備異聞。」以劉孝標，裴松之之才，豈不能自著一書？乃僅以註文自見；著作爲天下公物，不必别張一幟以自高。如鄭康成編註羣經，打破今古文門戶之見；朱熹註四書，發揮了許多理學的眞見地；註解程著作原有，樣的價値。</p>
<p>三。</p>
<p>近讀方東樹書林楊　，（淸桐城人）其中猶引前人評論著述文學，　有謂「著書立論，必杰於不得巳而有言，而後其言當，其言信，其言有用；故君子之言，達事理而止，不爲敷衍流宕，放言高論，取快一時。」有謂：「文之不可絕於天地間者，日，明道也，紀政事也，泰民隱也，樂道人之善也：若此者有益於天下，有益於將來，爲一篇，多一篇之益矣。」蓋古人把解决社會問題人生問題當作著作的唯一目的，所謂「我欲載之空言，不如見之於行事之深切著明也。」這爲人生而著作的態度，頗値得我們首肯的。可是這種態度最難於保持：戰國諸子百家各逞己意，說點切實的話；秦始皇以法家統一天下，只留方士神仙之說，先秦儒家最重節操，持論不遠仁義；而西漢儒家，丢開孔孟濟世主張，塗飾陰陽家色彩以干君聽。淸初顧黃顏王諸大儒，通經致用，明夷以待訪，謂「天下　亡，匹夫有責。一乾嘉文字獄迭興，一般學者，只講訓話義例，不敢稍談世務。自甲午以來，思想界感受强烈的刺激，社會問題人生問題幾度成爲討論的中心，這一類著作也如波浪似的有時銷行得很多，（光緒二十七八年，民國九十年十七八年間，坊閒都印這一類著作。）現在又轉爲四庫珍本古今圖書集成的流行期了，蓋爲人生而著作」，無分古今，此路皆不通行的！</p>
<p>防禦，也是相當有必要的。然而只作樣式的防禦，而不作生活充實的追求，自然是會墜入五里霧中了。</p>
<p>我以爲，「五四」以來，「小說」之市民權的獲得，是文學運動上之最大成功。「小說」是十數年來之最重要的文學樣式。「呐喊」的開天闢地的功勞，恐怕在中國文學史上要永遠地放着巨大的光輝的。如果說「十四年來中國現代文學唯一之成功，小品文之成功也，」那麽，未免有點過火。而「創作小說，卽有佳作，亦由小品散文訓練而來」底說法，如只就文章（Ｓｔｙｌｅ）之修錬的一點上來說，到未嘗不可，不過這種說法，很會使有些人誤會到作好小品文，則從事於小說之創作，是易如反掌。顺爲，從樣式之發生上說，「小說」並不是從小品散文派生出來的。（未完）</p>

<p>讀今日自由談林語堂先生一信，無法緘默，因寄數言。語堂目標所指，完全在我，現巳揭開黑幕，諒無所避，不能不辯。前在滬曾聞傳言，語堂策劃對我下總攻撃，但自問未有開罪該人之處，不敢置信，而今竟成事實，令人莫解究竟。我來硤石看燈巳四五日，連天霪雨，延未學行，昨始放晴，興會稍佳，乃於數百里外，被拉入是非旋渦，殊出意外。語堂謂我於人言，十日談，矛盾月刋，中華日報及自由談化名系統地攻撃人間世，不知有何證憑？矛盾月刋上論小品隨筆之類一文是我作，而其他各文便菲我作不可之理由何在？語堂如無强有力之眞憑實據以證明其他各文確爲我所作者，應不能逃避其有虚搆揑造誣栽陷害之惡意。語堂何以生此惡毒之心，我現不能明瞭，待看完花燈後，當返滬推究其故，闡明其眞意之所在，以表白於天下。語堂如能自省，人性發現，天良激動，必能翻其惡意傾害之毒念，則應有知過必改之勇，痛自懺悔，向公衆道歉可耳。信請照登，因欲兼示語堂，予以自新之路也。草草不二。章克標上，四月三十日本在硤石。</p>

<p>— 美國ＭａｒｋＴｗａｉｎ著（尊寒譯）</p>
<p>龑娜無可奈何地伸出他的王笏，同時在他的袍子裏，他那女人的心對於這不幸的罪犯的命運感着非常忍。他的兩眼浮上了涙水。他張開嘴正要說話時，司法大臣連忙對他說：「不要在那裏說，殿下，不要在那裏說！如果不坐在公爵的實座上，而對一個公爵的苗裔宣讀一通判决，那是不合法的。」</p>
<p>可憐的龔娜的起了一個戰慄。老克魯根斯坦的鋼筋鐵骨也抖了一下。龔娜還不曾加冕過呢！他敢去污凟實座嗎？他猶疑着回過身來，恐懼得面無人色。可是他非去不可。有些人巳經對他投來驚異的眼光。如果他再躊躇一會，那些眼光便會變得疑惑起來。他登上了實座的階沿。隨後他伸開王笏說道：</p>
<p>「被告，我現在以我們的主君勃朗郎登堡公爵烏　利　的名義執行我的務。聽我說啦。根據古來的國法，你除非把你的從犯交付給劊子乎，你才能免除死。你可利用這救助的機會啦。拯救你自己罷，如果這事可能的話；把你那孩子的父親的名字說出來罷！」</p>
<p>一種嚴重的沉默落在這最高的法庭上，一種深到連人們心的跳動都可聽到的沉默。郡主慢慢地轉過身來，兩眼閃耀着怨恨的眼光，用右手的食指着　娜說道：</p>
<p>「這孩子的父親卽是你啦。」</p>
<p>那遇到了一個没法救解和没有希望的災禍的悲痛的信念，使得龔娜的心上像死去般的起了一通戰慄。世間有什麽權力能够救他呢？倘要辯明，他便得宜佈他自己原是一個女人，然而一個没有加冕過的女人污凟了責座，也得被處死刑。因此他和他那兇暴的老父便不約而同地一齊暈倒在地上。</p>

<h3 id="c273">索夫團 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>在此春光明媚，景色宜人的時候，有不少的婦女正跌入春愁閨怨之中，所謂「怱見陌頭楊柳色，悔敎夫婿覓封候」者正是，這不過是英雄美人才子佳人的傷感，她們之自，尋煩惱，緣於本身之封候夢很深，或觸景傷情所致。其有不由於綺情蜜意，但竟至於「傷春」者，就不能與這些太太小姐比擬，最近奥國的索夫團卽屬此例。</p>
<p>據國民社十三日林資電：「今日本婦女數百人各携其小孩，擁至檢察廳，懇請釋放其丈夫，因其夫等曾於二月事變被捕人獄也····上奥長官隨接見彼等人表五十人，代表等除陳訴苦痛外，并謂刻巳無錢買糧，求與救濟」。這一索夫舉動，自然與有咫尺天涯之感者不可同日而語，因她們除「痛苦」外，尙有無錢買糧之莫大威脅故也。</p>
<p>從這一事件中，令我們想到前兩年當木屐朋友在滿洲之「斷然處置」正盛，而不抵抗主義亦方興未艾之時，東京的木屐婦女以其所天久從征役，耐不得「空床獨守」的滋味，也曾有過索夫團之舉，其跡雖近於兒女之情，但丈夫之受人掖制，失去自由，不得其效于飛，致出於登門坐索則一。</p>
<p>如果仿中國三家村的社會道德說，拆人夫妻，必損陰德，成人之美，勝造浮屠，那這些爲政者竟造成大批的怨男曠女，將永世不能遺其咎矣，不過照新的社會眼光來看，到不限於此一行動之道德與否這點來疵議。應當在這一現象之所普遍，有何種客觀原因所形成，怎樣的使其消滅這些問題上，加以考核。</p>
<p>顯然，目前的各國披上民主外衣的現社會制度，實質爲少數人統沿，一切國家行政的設施，都不過用以擁護他們的利益。他們利用政權這一形式，使自身的私願，變成爲「公衆利益」，强將自己企圖，譽爲人民的意志，在這一方法下，就演成了充滿現社會無數妻離子散的慘劇，反而認爲名正言順。就如像在飢寒交迫之下，多數人的生活巳經不安，社會巳經不安了，然而他們以維持治</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>安爲名，盡量的侵害人民的自由，盡量剝奪人民生存的機會，其結果產生了不知許多孤兒寡婦，所謂「安」者，僅自己無限享受之「安」而巳。再像國際間的許多戰爭罷，分明是許多財政巨頭在那兒强奪市塲，明火打刦，却要在國家這一形式下，安上一些民族光榮祖國勝利的高帽子，使無數死了兒子失了，丈夫的女子，因「光榮」「勝利」而不非議。但是這一「强姦公意」的高尙理想，不能使每個婦女都能了解，都能信任，此所以日奥婦女要求麵包要求工作　美，而有索夫之舉。</p>
<p>現刻世界騒亂之聲頻傳，國際的風雲亦殊緊急，將不知幾許婦女的人夫婿會被强制拆去，若不預先打破這些祖國光榮的思想，和殘喘苟安的態度，則許多男子將成炮灰，欲索亦無處索去。尤有進者，如果要根本消滅以多數男子去爲少數人利益犧牲的現象，卽掃除索夫的現象，那只有將以自巳私慾爲公衆意志的制度毁去。</p>
<p>「可憐無定河邊骨，猶是深閨夢裏人」，在大戰前夜想到這一情景巳經使人心驚肉悸了，加以許多大人們，視監禁爲唯一維持平安之計。未雨綢繆，預爲凖備，願我無數將步入「索夫」之婦女共勉圖之。</p>

<p>－大學雜景之一－</p>
<p>近幾天來，與我同住在這一間小樓上的十多個同學，無端地又起了一陣騒擾。不管是早晨，是傍晚，是在廣塲上，是在宿舍裏，只要三五人聚頭在一起，義是津津有味地這樣的談着：</p>
<p>「眞是奇怪，你說是我們自己的手指用力，堞子才走動，爲甚牠又能很淸楚地指字來呢？並且，我們的手指，又只是輕輕地觸在上面，一點力也没有用遇啦</p>
<p>「當然囑！　不是我們的手指用力；不過，這是帶點神秘性，不是我們的智力所能理解的」。</p>
<p>「你們想想看，我們中國過去並不是没有大發朋家；不過只因没有人將牠留傳下來，所以才弄到現在誰都糊頭糊腦吧了。譬如這一種最簡單的「活靈乩圖」，原就是我們中國古前所巳有的東西，及至科學發達到了極點的現在，不是人家還没有理解嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，那一種「活靈乩圖，····」他們所談的，究竟是在指個什麽，我全没有明白，不過在内心覺得有點怪訝而巳。後來我私問老林，才由他告訴我這裏的底細：</p>
<p>「活靈乩圖」，是一種問卜吉凶的東西，這圖是某留德傳士，費許多年的心血去研究靈魂學，才將我國過去所固有的舊法改良製成的。其式樣是：一方三尺見方的白紙，中間繪有一人個約一寸半徑的怪苏大形，人形的四周，有二千多隻字　環抱着。要問卜　，則用一隻内面　個同　中　　的　形樣　樣的小堞，覆置在　的中央。並在堞子的邊沿　一箭頭形，以爲指字之用。然後三個人以三隻右手的中指，一齊輕按着堞底，同時口中唸着這一句咒詞：「煩請堞弟呌ＸＸ（不拘死者或生者）到來談話。等到半小時過後，小堞就會慢慢地走動起來。（手指自然仍不應放開）這時，你可隨意問個什麽，牠都能很淸楚地指出字來覆答稱。</p>
<p>老林告訴我這些事情後，又很認眞很整重地說：</p>
<p>「眞是靈騐呢！你不相信，可以試試看。我前天告訴第Ｘ號房間那幾個山東佬，起初他們也不相信，直到昨天他們買回來親自實騐過，才相信我的話。咳！這眞是有點神秘性，聽說ＸＸ大學，差不多每個學生都玩起這玩意兒來，學校當局爲維持校譽起見，正要出佈告來禁止呢！」</p>
<p>這到底是什麽一回事，我没有親自試騐過，當然不敢說；但，許多大學生，竟因此而着了迷，我總有些不明白。是否現在大學生所幹的事，原就是不　人家理解的呢！</p>

<h3 id="e1">U.S. Formally Lodges Protest with Japan Against East Asian Monroe Doctrine; International Treaties Must Not Be Disregarded; Not Much Different Than Re-Stating The Stimson Doctrine <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, presented a statement to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on Sunday. The State Department released it today. The statement clearly expresses the United States' opposition to Japan's Asian Monroe Doctrine, which is the United States' formal attitude towards the Japanese Foreign Minister's declaration. Secretary of State Hull declared in the statement that the United States has no intention of consulting with Japan in advance regarding financial or other assistance to China, provided that such assistance does not violate existing treaties. The State Department's publication of the document to Japan this morning shows that the U.S. is acting independently and is not related to the UK. This is because U.S. Ambassador Grew presented the protest to Foreign Minister Hirota at 6 p.m. on Sunday (Tokyo time), several hours before British Foreign Secretary Simon reported to the House of Commons that the incident had come to an end. The U.S. statement places particular emphasis on the treaty obligations of all signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty. The U.S. statement declares that the United States appropriately understands the rights and obligations of other countries and hopes that other countries will appropriately understand the rights and obligations of the United States' legitimate interests. According to the opinion of the American people and the United States government, no country may, without the permission of other relevant countries, judge the rights, obligations, and legitimate interests of other independent and sovereign countries according to its own ideas. The U.S. statement continues that multilateral treaties concluded by relevant countries can only be legally amended or abolished with the agreement of the relevant countries. The U.S. statement also states that the United States, alone and in conjunction with other countries, will continue to implement its good neighbor policy. The publication of the U.S. statement to Japan further proves that the UK and the U.S. will not take concerted action at present. As for the possibility of such action in the future, it depends on new developments in the situation. However, before this statement was submitted to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, U.S. State Department officials consulted with the UK, France, Italy, and other signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull issued a formal statement today, stating that the Ambassador to Japan, following the instructions of the State Department, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on April 29 and presented a document, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Japanese government has recently expressed its attitude towards Japan's interests and those of other countries in China. This expression comes from a responsible party, so it cannot be ignored. In order for the U.S. government to abide by the frank customs in the relationship between the U.S. and Japanese governments, it is necessary to re-state the U.S. position on the issues involved. The U.S. relationship with China, like the U.S. opposition to other countries' relationship with Japan, is governed by generally recognized principles of international law and the provisions of treaties signed by the U.S. The U.S. has certain rights and obligations in China, and has concluded multilateral treaties with China or Japan or both China and Japan and certain other countries regarding rights and obligations in the Far East. The U.S. has also joined a large multilateral treaty that almost all countries in the world have joined. This treaty can only be legally amended or abolished using the explicitly stated and recognized procedures agreed upon by the signatory countries. In its international interactions and relations, the U.S. government wants to appropriately consider the rights, obligations, and legitimate interests of other countries, and also expects other governments to give appropriate consideration to the rights, obligations, and legitimate interests of the U.S. The U.S. people and the U.S. government believe that no country, without the consent of the relevant other countries, can legally attempt to arbitrarily and dogmatically decide in situations involving the rights, obligations, and legitimate interests of other sovereign countries. The U.S. government has placed the U.S. in a good neighbor policy, and in the implementation of this policy, it will continue to devote its best efforts, alone and in conjunction with other governments, to this policy."

<p>(Washington) Political circles here believe that Secretary of State Hull's remarks yesterday regarding U.S. Far East policy are a general statement of U.S. principles regarding international relations. These principles can be applied to any situation involving treaty rights and obligations. Political circles do not regard this as an unfriendly gesture towards Japan, because Hull's remarks include U.S. policy not only towards Japan, but also towards China, the Philippines, and "Manchukuo."

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the official statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hull on April 30 can still be said to be a re-elaboration of the Stimson Doctrine. After discussing with the heads of the Foreign Ministry, Foreign Minister Hirota believes that it is necessary to make the current situation in East Asia clear to the extent that it does not further provoke the United States. Therefore, it has been decided to issue another statement, which is currently being drafted. (2nd China United Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities are currently carefully studying the content of the statement issued by U.S. Secretary of State Hull. It is noted that the statement does not require a reply, but if it is deemed necessary to respond, it is still planned to find some way to express Japan's intentions, which is also unknown. The Foreign Ministry believes that there is no need to reply promptly, and because Ambassador to the United States Saito will be taking leave to return to his country within July, discussions on this issue will be conducted concurrently with discussions on U.S. policy.

<p>(New York) The New York Times Washington dispatch states that the State Department has no intention of continuing to pursue the matter with Japan.

The State Department hopes to encourage a spirit of amity and friendship towards Japan, as expressed in the exchange of letters between Foreign Minister Hirota and Secretary of State Hull this March. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman stated that he believes that the UK and the U.S. have used a strong attitude to ensure the effectiveness of the Nine-Power Treaty.

<p>(London) Today, at the request of the Chinese Embassy, the British Foreign Office provided a formal explanation of Foreign Secretary Simon's statement in the House of Commons on Monday regarding the special rights of Japan in China. The Foreign Office stated that this refers to the Japanese railway areas within Manchuria and the Japanese concession in Hankou. The Foreign Office further stated that there is an annotation to the effect that the section on Japan's special rights is "recognized by all countries." Diplomatic circles believe that the Foreign Office's explanation is very important and contains the implication that the UK continues to recognize Manchuria as part of China. However, Chinese circles here still believe that the British Foreign Office's explanation has failed to satisfy the Chinese Embassy, and stated that the Chinese Embassy is planning to inquire again, because the Chinese government is not aware of any special rights of Japan in China that are recognized by all countries. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi, when asked by a Reuters reporter today for his opinion on Foreign Secretary Simon's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday, replied that the British Foreign Secretary's remarks were mostly satisfactory, but that he would ask him to explain the meaning of the sentence "Japan has special rights and interests recognized by other countries that are not enjoyed by other countries." Although the matter can now be regarded as officially concluded, the Chinese people do not harbor any illusions about Japan's true intentions. In his view, Russia knows the true danger in the Far East more clearly than other countries, so Russia attaches great importance to the current situation. He believes that Russia is now making every effort to consolidate its defenses in the Far East. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(New York) The New York Evening Post's editorial today expressed dissatisfaction with British Foreign Secretary Simon's statement in the House of Commons yesterday regarding "Japan's special rights and interests recognized by other countries that are not enjoyed by other countries." It stated that the U.S. has not recognized Japan's special rights and interests. In 1923, U.S. Secretary of State Hughes and Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Hanihara exchanged letters to cancel the Lansing-Ishii Agreement, which unfortunately mentioned such special rights and interests. Japan may in the future realize that the U.S. is the only country that cannot sit idly by and watch Japan carry out its new policies. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Labor MP Mander asked Foreign Secretary Simon to notify the League of Nations of the remarks recently made by Yokoyama, the Japanese Consul General in Geneva. The Foreign Secretary replied that he was not aware of Yokoyama's speech to the League of Nations. He only read about Yokoyama's remarks to journalists in the newspaper. A distinction must be made between remarks to journalists and remarks to the League of Nations. The Foreign Secretary did not want to be swayed by any criticism of Yokoyama's remarks.

<h3 id="e8">The U.S. Protest Is Gentle in Tone But Firm in Meaning; Emphasizes Action Over Words; Roosevelt Asks for Appropriation to Build Ships <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(New York) The protest that U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo Grew presented to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on April 29 has been formally published by the State Department. Newspapers believe that the tone of the protest is gentle, but the will is firm. The New York Times said that there are two points in the U.S. protest that are noteworthy. The first point is that the protest is the first step taken by the Roosevelt administration to express its views on the China issue. The second point is that the U.S. government is making a formal statement based on the Pact of Paris for the first time. Washington diplomatic circles declare that the matter is now considered closed. The New York Evening Post said that three years ago, when Japanese troops were taking action in Manchuria, former Secretary of State Stimson issued a declaration expressing opposition (early January 1932, the content of which stated that the U.S. could not recognize Japan's occupation of Manchuria, nor could it recognize the system established after the occupation), which greatly dissatisfied Japan. The U.S. government's protest to Japan this time can be said to have opened a new chapter in U.S.-Japan relations. According to the newspaper, Roosevelt's policy is more moderate in language, but more resolute in action. For example, the government's decision to reform the navy to meet modern needs, ordering naval aircraft to make non-stop flights between San Francisco and Honolulu (January 10 of this year), recognizing Soviet Russia but not recognizing "Manchukuo," and continuing to lend money to China, all show that it emphasizes action and not words. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is now learned that President Roosevelt plans to allocate US$50 million from the public works fund for the construction of submarines and destroyers. This fact, together with large-scale naval exercises in the Panama Canal Zone, and serious preparations for studying the Aleutian Islands, is clearly Washington's response to Japan's statement. The Washington Star stated that the situation in the Far East increasingly proves the correctness of the Navy Department's policy, and the department is now concentrating the navy in the Pacific.

<p>(Washington) State Department officials stated today that the diplomatic dispute caused by the Japanese declaration will come to an end. It is said that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew's protest to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, and the recent statement by the Secretary of State, have clarified the U.S. position, so there is no need to say more at this time, because continuing the discussion would be of no avail. However, it will continue to monitor Japan's actions in China. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Borah criticized Secretary of State Hull's remarks, saying that he completely agrees with Hull, and that this statement is currently a full explanation of the U.S. policy of the open door in China. There may be other developments in the future, depending on what action Japan takes. He hopes that Japan can accept it in the spirit of these remarks, and respect U.S. rights and interests. Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Saito and Chinese Ambassador Dr. Shih made no criticism. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Tokyo Announces the Details of the Negotiations Between the UK, U.S., and Japan <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the previously issued informal statement, the Foreign Ministry released the following details on the 1st after meeting with the ambassadors of the UK and the U.S.:</p>
<p>On April 25, the British Ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Hirota and said that, following the instructions of his government, he requested that the views of the Japanese government as stated in the previously published informal statement be explained. The British Ambassador also explained the UK's position on the treaty, and also spoke about the following: The British government, because of the statement, claimed that it was based on certain actions by the powers in China, which were harmful to the peace of East Asia and Sino-Japanese relations, or caused concern about the preservation of China. However, from the perspective of British policy, such uneasy situations should not occur. In fact, the UK is avoiding these harmful measures.</p>
<p>The above conversation was the British Ambassador's statement of the British Foreign Secretary's explanation. Foreign Minister Hirota greatly appreciated its meaning, and at the same time explained Japan's position on the informal statement, and explained Japan's geographical position in East Asia, saying that Japan has the greatest concern for maintaining peace and order in East Asia, which is naturally the reason why distant countries cannot compare.</p>
<p>After Foreign Minister Hirota clarified the position of the Japanese government, he informed the U.S. Ambassador to Japan of the main points of the previous informal statement, and at the same time sent them to the British Embassy in Japan. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japan will never harm the independence and interests of China in any way, and not only does it have no intention of harming it, but it sincerely hopes for the preservation and unity and prosperity of China, and the preservation and unity and prosperity of China should, in principle, be entrusted to China's own self-awareness and efforts. Japan does not have any intention of harming the interests of any third country in China. Commerce and economic contact with China by third countries in good faith are beneficial to China, and Japan naturally welcomes it, because Japan firmly maintains the principle of equal opportunity for the open door in China, and strictly abides by the various treaties that are currently valid in China. However, Japan cannot silently tolerate any action or any form that violates the peace and order of East Asia, because Japan must also consider its geographical position in East Asia, so it has the most close concern for maintaining peace and order in that area. Therefore, regarding the China issue, if any third party implements its own self-serving policy without regard to the above situation, Japan will never stand idly by and watch it happen.

<p>San Francisco British former Conservative MP Newton arrived here today from the Far East, condemning the League of Nations' policy towards "Manchukuo," saying that the implementation of the League of Nations' recommendations is impossible. Europe has never understood the difficulty of the situation, and Japan will never give up. When asked about the possibility of war, Newton replied that Japanese militarists have the danger of being rampant and uncontrollable like Germany in 1914. Newton, 77, was a member of the House of Commons for more than ten years. In 1916, he entered the Foreign Office, and later served as a senior official in the Army Department for Prisoner Management until 1919. He has now returned from a tour of the Far East and will go to Geneva to provide the League of Nations with materials on the Manchuria issue for research at the meeting. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e14">On the U.S. Note to Japan <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The U.S. government's note to Japan was delivered to Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday by its ambassador to Tokyo. We carefully examine the wording of the note and the overall position of the U.S. government reflected in it. I feel that the implications are far-reaching. What it involves has actually transcended the simple diplomatic dispute targeting the Japanese side's statement on China, and includes various issues directly related to both Japan and the United States.</p>
<p>For now, let's set aside the content of the note and only observe the fact that it was formally submitted. I feel that it is sufficient to reveal the true face of President Roosevelt's attitude toward Japan in the year since he took office, so that people from all countries with a vital stake in today's Pacific can have a correct understanding in this regard. This is truly a beneficial act. Not only that, but in view of Roosevelt's past silence on the Far East situation, I feel that this sudden epoch-making "frank" statement is even more powerful, and holds the preparation and determination to ultimately implement its claims. Yesterday and the day before, I discussed that Japan would certainly not retract the position it adopted in its statement. This is a strong corroboration. All of our compatriots who feel that Japan has softened because the UK and the U.S. have spoken out fairly and impartially are greatly mistaken. If Japan really softened, the governments of all countries would know it best. Washington's submission of the note is hardly unnecessary.</p>
<p>If we try to put ourselves in Roosevelt's position, we will know that this note to Japan has exhausted the ability to use rhetoric. However, its content is by no means limited to passively protesting Japan. It actually contains an active warning. It is heard that Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota believes that this note is a re-elaboration of the Stimson Doctrine. This can be described as a penetrating comment. The note also mentions the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the treaties signed at the Washington Conference. It also has the phrase "the position of the U.S. government also needs to be re-stated" (according to the Japan United Press translation). The position it refers to is, of course, the position of the Hoover-Stimson administration. The so-called Hoover Doctrine or Stimson Doctrine is a crystallization of this position and contains an active nature. The concrete explanations of this active nature are: (1) The world should not have wars after the Kellogg-Briand Pact was signed. If there is a war, the world will be divided into two major warring groups. There is no so-called neutral party, implying that the U.S. may eventually participate in the war. (2) The situation before the conclusion of the treaties signed at the Washington Conference and the impact after the conclusion all have a chain-like nature. Japan's violation of the Nine-Power Treaty is that even if the U.S. cannot quickly crack down on Japan, it should not expect the U.S. to be bound by the naval treaty forever, implying that the U.S. should use expanding naval power as a means to maintain the balance in the Pacific that has already been destroyed. The original note mentions multilateral treaties between China, Japan, the U.S., and other countries. It uses the word Treaties, which is plural, and it is very clear that it is not limited to the Nine-Power Treaty. From this, it is predicted that Japan and the U.S. will have major disputes at next year's Second Washington Naval Conference to discuss amending the London Naval Treaty, and its conclusions will be the issue of whether the naval ratio between Japan and the U.S. or Japan, the U.S., and the UK should be affected by the changes in the Far East situation after the "September 18th Incident." Hirota is eager to limit the discussion topics to naval disarmament issues at that time, and to exclude the Far East issue, in order to avoid discussing the Sino-Japanese pending issues in the form of an international conference. Roosevelt has taken the opportunity to give a reply rejecting it. I wonder if our country's authorities have made active preparations for this key that has a vital stake.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are two matters that are related to the submission of this note that are worth noting. One is the tacit agreement between the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. The other is that before the submission, the U.S. State Department had consulted with the UK, France, Italy, and other signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty (of course, excluding Japan). Regarding the former, since Japan's statement was issued, key figures in the Senate, which shares real diplomatic power with the U.S. president, such as Borah, Robinson, and King, have all made public statements, which have greatly influenced public opinion and strengthened Roosevelt's position at home and abroad. Regarding the latter, although this note was submitted unilaterally by the U.S., it has at least received the spiritual support of the authorities of the other seven signatory countries. In our previous article, we said that the time for convening the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has matured. Japan will certainly participate in this conference, which is expected, but our country cannot abandon its treaty rights and obligations. Otherwise, it may not avoid being suspected of violating the treaty itself, let alone others. It must be known that this is the responsibility that all signatory countries should fulfill. There is no so-called pleading for mercy in our country, and there is no so-called showing favor in all countries. This is also a feeling we have gained in addition to paying attention to the U.S. note, and it should be told to our authorities.</p>
<p>Now Roosevelt's attitude toward Japan is very clear. The Soviet Union's preparations for war against Japan are accelerating. The League of Nations' Administrative Council meeting and advisory meeting will be held within half a month to discuss the Far East situation, and the time for next year's Second Washington Naval Conference is also approaching. All of this is closely related to Japan's interests, and the solutions or countermeasures that its national authorities can see are all sought in the rapid oppression of China. It is truly regrettable. Recently, the three-headed meeting of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hirota, Shigemitsu, and Arima, decided to quickly resolve the Sino-Japanese pending issues through direct negotiations, following the U.S. note, and its military's aggressive strategy has the potential to spread from North China to South China. This shows that the situation is extremely serious. The disaster of national subjugation is imminent for our people. Can they still be at ease and indifferent?</p>
<h3 id="e15">Legislative Yuan Reviews Diplomatic Proposals; Xiao Shuyu's Proposal is Withdrawn at His Own Request; Liu Guantun's Proposal is Passed After Revision <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Review Committee for Diplomatic Proposals of the Legislative Yuan held a review meeting at 3:30 p.m. on the 2nd. Fu Bingchang, Liang Hancao, Liu Guantun, Zhong Tianxin, Gu Zhenggang, Xiao Shuyu, Ma Yinchu, etc. attended. Fu Bingchang chaired. First, Xiao Shuyu's four proposals were reviewed: (1) Sincere unity, (2) Unified construction mechanism, (3) Implement savings to save the country, (4) Nationals should receive military training. After Xiao explained the purpose of the proposals, the committee members all expressed their opinions. All believed that the first point was essential, but it was not within the powers of the Legislative Yuan and was not convenient to propose, so it was decided to retain it. However, Xiao believed that the entire case was related, and if the first point was retained, even if the remaining three points were passed, it would be difficult to take effect. He automatically requested that the entire case be withdrawn. Then, Liu Guantun's diplomatic proposal was reviewed, which included four points: urging the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to convene a meeting to discuss sanctions against violent Japan, etc. After Liu explained the various points in writing, the proposal was carefully reviewed. As a result, the original text was revised and made into a proposal, which was scheduled to be submitted to the Yuanhui on the 4th for discussion and decision, and then sent to the Central Political Council for the reference of the diplomatic authorities. According to Liang Hancao after the meeting, Xiao's proposal's first two points are outside the scope of legislation and should be expressed by local party departments, etc., or submitted to the central government for review. The result has been deleted. However, Xiao's original intention for the proposal was purely to save the country and had no other intention. As for the Sino-Japanese diplomatic issue, the situation is extremely serious. At this time, the determination of the Nine-Power Treaty must be awakened first. Our country advocates according to law, and all countries should be able to express sympathy. If this is not sought, what else can be sought? Someone said that Japan has now withdrawn the statement it issued on April 10, and the issue has come to an end. This statement is very misleading. We should know that Japan's policy towards China is a long-standing strategic policy. Regardless of whether its statement is withdrawn or not, its policy of aggression against China will never change, or</p>
<p>even be more active. In order to save themselves, the Chinese people should wake up quickly. Diplomacy, in particular, must have a resolute, sensitive, and concrete approach. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the statement of April 17th achieved the following results: (1) The Japanese people have increased awareness of the importance of the East Asian issue; (2) The British statement on China policy expresses a willingness to advance with mutual understanding with Japan; (3) Japan's determination to oppose all activities to aid China has made this clear to all countries. Therefore, Ariyoshi will be urged to actively negotiate further, in order to reap the actual benefits mentioned above (Xinhua News Agency dispatch, 2nd).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the governments of Britain and the United States have simultaneously understood the purpose of the so-called statement on China policy, and have expressed a friendly attitude. He believes this issue has come to an end, and is very satisfied that Japan's special status has gained the understanding of both Britain and the United States. He has resolved to use this as a background for bravely advancing towards the fundamental resolution of the China issue, and the implementation of peaceful work with Britain and the United States (Dentsu dispatch, 2nd).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After returning to Tokyo on the 28th, Ambassador to China Akira Ariyoshi immediately visited Foreign Minister Hirota and Vice Minister Shigemitsu at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3 p.m. The three held a two-hour meeting, focusing on Ambassador Ariyoshi's report and discussing China policy. As a result, the following policies were decided: In the future, a normal channel of Sino-Japanese diplomacy will be established in accordance with these policies, and then efforts will be made to resolve various outstanding issues between China and Japan.</p>
<p>(1) Various issues between China and Japan should be resolved through direct negotiations between the two countries, and intervention by the League of Nations and third countries should not be permitted.</p>
<p>(2) Japan has no intention of invading China. This policy remains unchanged from the past. Japan earnestly hopes for China's unification.</p>
<p>(3) Japan will resolutely repel all means that hinder the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>(4) Apart from direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, there is no way to resolve the various outstanding issues between China and Japan, and to adjust the political, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries (Rengo dispatch, 1st).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Akira Ariyoshi, the Ambassador to China who is currently returning to the country, visited Minister of the Army Hayashi at his official residence yesterday to offer his respects upon returning home. At the same time, he held important talks regarding the recent situation in China, especially the National Government's intentions towards Japan, the situation in South China, and the situations in Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia. He left at 4:30 p.m. Subsequently, Harada Osamu, secretary to Prince Saionji, also visited Minister of the Army Hayashi, reporting that Prince Saionji would be entering Kyoto on the 2nd, and held various important talks. Commander of the Military Police, Qin, visited the Minister of the Army again at 5 p.m. to discuss a major incident and report on recent situations (Dentsu News Agency dispatch, 2nd).</p>

<p>(London) Many British newspapers criticized the statements made by British Foreign Secretary Simon regarding Japan's China policy.</p>
<p>The Times of London stated that, "What may be accepted today is that Japan, when it feels that peace in the Far East is endangered, should not take unilateral action or reject international plans to aid China. This has at least produced the satisfactory result of making world opinion clearly aware of the trend of Japan's policy. Japan's repeated statements about its mission and its obligations and responsibilities for unilateral action naturally raise concerns that Tokyo will expand its influence in the Far East and carry out its policy, which has already been effective in Manchuria. The Japanese government, now aware of the strong public outrage, should know that what is tolerated in the several disintegrated provinces of Northeastern China will not be tolerated if implemented in the South, as the interests of the Chinese central government and other countries will be more affected. If Japan can restore trust after making the same policy statements as other countries, and shift the energy of the Far Eastern countries, which is now spent on preparations to prevent foreign aggression, to construction projects, then much will be gained" (Reuters dispatch, 1st).</p>
<h3 id="e19">Hirota's Irrelevant Answer <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian stated in today's editorial that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs deeply knows how to remain silent itself while letting its ambassadors speak volubly abroad. What Britain is questioning and what Japan is answering, the gist of which can certainly be found in the statements made by Foreign Secretary Simon in the House of Commons. Foreign Minister Hirota's answer was light and evasive, as expected. The key points inquired by British Ambassador Linley were left unanswered, and he replied with general remarks. Was British Ambassador Linley not asking Japan to explain the statements made by Japanese ambassadors, consuls, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokespersons abroad? However, British Foreign Secretary Simon stated that the Japanese reply was still clear, perhaps for strategic reasons. However, we cannot say that the Foreign Secretary is truly satisfied, as the Japanese remarks must be regarded as responsible statements made by responsible personnel with Tokyo's approval. Japan's formal statements and its informal statements clearly contradict each other, but the joint warnings and threats issued by spokespersons from all aspects of Japan cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, this matter has not ended, and we can say that a new page in history has now been opened (Reuters dispatch, 1st).</p>

<p>"The informal declaration issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 17th is surrounded by an unfathomable mystery. Foreign Secretary Simon's declaration yesterday also failed to clarify this mystery. Not only did it not clarify it, but because Japan implicitly withdrew its declaration, and the official explanations that the Tokyo government had previously allowed to be published were indefinitely delayed, this mystery became even more profound and plunged people into a fog. Moreover, the so-called withdrawal is not a correction, and what its official and informal statements declared cannot be said to be non-existent. This is why some people still feel somewhat uneasy. However, this incident has been declared over. Simon, in the midst of the incident, was able to adopt a prudent policy, and with skillful and firm hands, restated Britain's rights. This is to be congratulated for Simon," etc. (Havas dispatch).</p>

<h3 id="e23">League of Nations Meeting This Month: Three Major Issues Included on the Agenda; Principle of Non-Recognition of Pseudo-Organizations; Advisory Committee to Conduct Thorough Discussion; All Parties Express Enthusiasm in Welcoming Russia <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) This month, Geneva will discuss important political issues concerning peace in three continents. Those included on the League of Nations' agenda are the Saar plebiscite issue of 1935, the tense situation caused by the Gran Chaco War in South America, and the "Manchukuo" issue in the Far East. Among the three, the Gran Chaco and Saar issues will be discussed at the spring regular meeting of the League of Nations' Administrative Council, which opens on May 14th. The issue of non-recognition of "Manchukuo" will be discussed by the League of Nations' Sino-Japanese Special Advisory Committee, which is convened on the same day. In addition, the disarmament issue will also be raised for discussion. Most politicians on the Administrative Council believe that the fate of the League of Nations depends on whether it can smoothly resolve the disarmament deadlock, and the League of Nations' authority in the United States also depends on its ability to resolve the conflict between Bolivia and Paraguay.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese dispute still has repercussions in Geneva. Therefore, when the Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee and the Administrative Council hold meetings at the same time, difficulties will arise. After Britain's request, the Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee scheduled a special meeting to discuss postal relations with Manchuria without violating the League of Nations' principle of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." According to reports, the "Manchukuo" authorities requested that postal fees for mail passing through "Manchukuo" be paid. Britain is deeply concerned that this fact may be mistakenly interpreted as recognition of "Manchukuo" in an invisible way. Therefore, it sought the opinion of the League of Nations Committee. Most well-informed diplomats say that the Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee (of which the United States is also a member) will take the opportunity to conduct a thorough discussion of the principle of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." Since the League of Nations passed the de facto or de jure non-recognition of "Manchukuo," all parties have clearly expressed dissatisfaction with this principle, especially the European and American countries. Britain, France, and Germany have even hinted that the principle hinders business and normal relations with "Manchuria." Therefore, most observers now believe that the committee is inclined to weaken the non-recognition doctrine. Although the League of Nations does not approve of political or commercial relations with "Manchukuo," merchants in France and Germany are now competing for commercial privileges in "Manchukuo." This issue has become increasingly important. Many parties have indicated that the Soviet Union may change its previous attitude of not participating in the Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee. Some diplomats acknowledge that the Soviet Union's participation in this committee will be a prelude to the Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations. European countries are paying special attention to the preparations for the Saar plebiscite and the negotiations on the Franco-German disarmament agreement. The Special Committee on the Saar issue is currently preparing a report for the Administrative Council's discussion. The self-determination of the Saar residents should be held in January 1935. Saar residents who are 20 years old or older and who resided in the area on January 20, 1920, have the right to vote to determine whether the Saar (1) will return to Germany, (2) merge with France, or (3) remain under League of Nations administration. Although this is purely a matter for France and Germany, its resolution is of great importance to the future peace of Europe. German Chancellor Hitler is eager for the Saar to return to Germany and has publicly stated that if the Saar is returned to Germany, Germany and France can live in peace. Therefore, the Administrative Council may encounter fierce debate when discussing this issue. As for the conflict between Bolivia and Paraguay, the League of Nations Special Committee has failed to negotiate a reconciliation in the region. Therefore, the Administrative Council must now devise new solutions for this matter (National Telegram, 2nd).</p>

<p>(Changchun) The Gao Chengzhang conspiracy incident, which aimed to disrupt the "Manchukuo" and obstruct the realization of the imperial system by destroying the main buildings of the four cities of Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, and Dalian, was brought to light due to the activities of the Harbin Fujiadian Gendarmerie. Party members were identified, explosives were confiscated, and the evil plan was prevented from happening. This plan was suspected of being carried out under the instructions of a certain secret reconnaissance team. In order to investigate, publication was prohibited. It has been four months, and the incident has come to an end. The ban was lifted at 10 a.m. today. The course of the incident is roughly as follows: Fearing that the "Manchukuo Emperor" would ascend the throne, consolidate the national foundation, and that Sino-Japanese relations would become closer, a certain secret reconnaissance team, with team member Gao Chengzhang as the commander, led twelve Chinese people to set off first, carrying fifty explosives disguised as soap, and three boxes of kerosene. In mid-January, they secretly entered Manchuria and began to implement the plan. The party first sent the explosives to Liu Hanlin, a secret agent of the organization in Mudanjiang, and then divided into groups to sneak into the four cities. Just as Harbin was holding the first phase of the grand ceremony's security, Gao Chengzhang, disguised as a coolie, was eventually caught by the gendarmerie. According to his confession, the gendarmerie organized several suicide squads, seized the explosives hidden in Mudanjiang, and the remaining criminals were also arrested by the Japanese and Manchukuo authorities (Dentsu News Agency dispatch, 2nd).</p>

<p>Worldwide Labor Day</p>
<h3 id="e48">Moscow Skies: Over Five Hundred Aircraft Soar; Paris Socialist and Communist Parties Clash; Berlin: Two Million People Attend Grand Gathering; Tokyo: Three Thousand Police Maintain Strict Security <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(London) According to Reuter's dispatches from various capitals today, fears of disturbances on May Day were unfounded. Paris, Madrid, Havana, New York, and Chicago were the focal points of activity. Paris was under extremely tight guard, resembling a military camp. Machine guns and armored vehicles were prepared for any incident. The radical faction's plan for a general strike to celebrate Labor Day failed. Only workers in the state-run cigarette and match factories went on strike. Of the 30,000 employees of the Paris City Hall, only 400 went on strike, and only 10% of factory workers participated. Police arrested 47 picketers. Socialists and Communists clashed, injuring several people.</p>
<p>The most enthusiastic celebrations worldwide were seen in Germany, but German authorities were also on high alert to prevent any out-of-bounds actions. Berlin initiated a national Labor Day celebration to counteract the Communist celebration. Throughout the country, groups marched to the Danelhof Square to participate in the grand gathering, reaching two million people. When Prussian Premier Goering, in Nazi stormtrooper uniform, ascended the platform, the crowd shouted "Long live Goering!" Military music played, and airplanes soared overhead. When Premier Hitler arrived at the scene, the crowd cheered even more fervently. Hitler, upon taking the stage, stated that today was the first day of Germany's Four-Year Plan. He then spoke of the German people's awakening and the unprecedented developments of the past year, saying that some criticized that Socialism was not yet implemented. He emphasized the importance of their creation. He stated that one thing was undoubtedly clear: bureaucratic politics could not save the country. Hitler also claimed that Germany wanted not revenge but peace. Hitler's speech was filled with patriotism, greatly pleasing the listeners. In Moscow, 160 bombers and 375 reconnaissance and observation aircraft participated in Labor Day, with over 500 aircraft circling the sky, creating an unprecedented air force spectacle in the Russian capital. Millions of civilians marched, holding aloft images of Lenin and Stalin. Another notable feature was a squadron of female soldiers. In London, about 1,800 people, including Communist left-wing groups and the unemployed, held Labor Day in Hyde Park, but the Labor Party and the Trades Union Congress did not participate. Very few representatives from formal unions attended. A dispatch from New Delhi reported that 3,000 textile workers went on strike, causing disturbances and injuring 150 people. The situation in Austria and Spain remained normal. (1st Reuter's dispatch)</p>
<p>Bury: This morning's Labor Day ceremony in the local area, due to the absence of Galen, Commander-in-Chief of the Far Eastern Red Army, featured a speech by the Vice-Chairman of the Far Eastern Military Council. He stated that Japan was vigorously conducting anti-Soviet propaganda in the Far East, and the Red Army should do its utmost to maintain peace in the Far East. However, if imperialists dare to violate the border, they would definitely be met with the most violent strike, and so on. Also, the army participating in the ceremony totaled about 14,000 people, with more than 200 various light and heavy tanks. In addition to the infantry, cavalry, and artillery, the rest were mechanized, and the military appearance was even more orderly than in previous years. (1st Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Yesterday, on the May Day anniversary, a large-scale military parade was held here. One thousand fighter planes soared in the sky, and more than one hundred thousand citizens participated. Representatives from various embassies attended, including Wu Nan-ru, the acting Chinese ambassador, Feng Sheng-yun, the military attaché, and other embassy staff. (2nd World News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday at midnight, a serious riot suddenly broke out in the workers' district. Demonstrators attacked those driving streetcars for business. The drivers called the police, and the demonstrators retreated into buildings in the district, throwing objects at the police and firing guns multiple times, injuring one officer. The police chief, upon hearing the alarm, personally led 2,000 police officers to the scene and, with the assistance of a squadron of patrol troops, surrounded the building. However, all entrances were blocked by rioters. A special police unit is now preparing to charge in wearing helmets. Further reports indicate that at dawn, the rioters, outnumbered, were finally stormed by the police. Some rioters obeyed orders and opened the door, while the rest were subdued by police using gun butts. A total of twenty people were arrested. (2nd Reuter's dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, on Labor Day, an outrageous act occurred in the famous city of Vogelsburg in Bavaria, causing public outrage throughout the country. The Nazi Party had organized a Labor Day celebration and built a wooden enclosure capable of holding ten thousand people, but it was suddenly set on fire. According to eyewitnesses, an explosion was heard before the fire started. The authorities immediately offered a reward of one thousand marks for the capture of the arsonists, promising severe punishment if caught. The Nazi Party leader in Vogelsburg has telegraphed Premier Hitler and Propaganda Minister Goebbels, claiming that the perpetrators were Communists. (1st Reuter's dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today is Labor Day, and various factions from the left and right wings are holding demonstrations in various places. Therefore, three thousand police officers were mobilized and concentrated this morning to prepare for any eventuality. However, the whole day was quiet. Only one left-wing figure, Ms. Inoue, was giving a speech advocating the eradication of Fascism, which is an obstacle to labor, when she was stopped by the police. When right-wingers gathered to demonstrate, they had the following slogans: "Wages should be increased to the standards of the world's top countries," and "Work 48 hours per week." When left-wingers held meetings and demonstrations, their slogans were mostly "Down with Fascism, the enemy of workers and peasants," "Jobs and bread for the unemployed," and "Increase wages by 30%," and so on. (1st Reuter's dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) Communists in New York celebrated Labor Day today with countless flags, shouting slogans, and holding public speeches and singing the Internationale. The large number of participants was unprecedented. The police had great difficulty maintaining order because they wanted to separate the Communists from the Socialists to prevent clashes between the two parties, which was not easy. The police department announced that it would allow red speeches and the singing of the Internationale on this day, provided there were no riots in principle. Therefore, the marchers became even more enthusiastic. Previously, during Labor Day marches, the police often dispersed the crowd with batons and tear gas. (1st National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Manila) The Philippines has taken its first step towards independence today. At 11:10 this morning, the Senate and House of Representatives held a joint session and unanimously passed the Tydings–McDuffie Act. As a result, the Philippines will become a democratic republic within twelve to thirteen years. Coincidentally, the Philippine Assembly's acceptance of the independence act occurred on the thirty-sixth anniversary of the American naval commander George Dewey's great victory in Manila Bay, when he bloodlessly drove the Spanish out of the Pacific. Senate President Quezon will likely be honored as the first president of the Philippine Republic. Quezon has been involved in the Philippine independence movement for twenty years. He once delivered his famous speech, saying that he would rather live under an independent government, even if it became a hell under Filipino self-rule, than under American rule in paradise. The Tydings–McDuffie Act was passed by the US House of Representatives on March 19 and by the Senate on March 25, allowing the Philippines to become independent within twelve to thirteen years. Previously, the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act was rejected by the Philippine Senate last year and was withdrawn on January 17. Afterwards, Quezon, the head of the Philippine independence delegation, made a request, which led to this amendment, stipulating that the US Army would withdraw completely within this year, while naval bases would be withdrawn upon the completion of independence. As for the continued establishment of naval fuel matters, the US government and Philippine officials will decide directly. The Philippine Assembly will convene a constitutional convention before October 1 of this year to draft a constitution. (1st National Telegram)</p>

<p>Vienna: Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss is currently making every effort to implement the new constitution. Prince Starhemberg, leader of the Austrian Fascist Homeland Security Force, was appointed Deputy Prime Minister today. Former Deputy Prime Minister Fey was appointed National Security Minister, a position similar to the British Cabinet's War Minister. It is widely believed that Prince Starhemberg's appointment as Deputy Prime Minister is a natural result of Austria's transformation into a Fascist state. According to official announcements, President Miklas will sign an agreement between Austria and the Vatican at midnight today, a move that indicates progress in relations between Austria and the Pope in recent months.

<h3 id="e51">Prussian Premier Goering Resigns: Focuses on Aviation <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) General Goering, Premier of Prussia, submitted his resignation this morning. It is rumored that German Interior Minister Frick will succeed him. It is said that Goering resigned because he is also the German Aviation Commissioner, and serving as both Premier of Prussia hinders his focus on Germany's aviation industry. Therefore, he relinquished the concurrent position to dedicate himself to the affairs of the German Air Force and national defense. After General Goering's resignation, President Hindenburg immediately established a new ministry called the "German Ministry of Science, Education, and Training," with Dr. Rust as the minister. It is said that this change is another step towards concentrating power in accordance with the Nazi Party's plan to reform Germany. (30th Reuter's dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) General Goering's resignation from his concurrent position as Prussian Interior Minister, replaced by German Interior Minister Frick, marks the end of a chapter in Prussian history and another step in the Nazi Party's reform of Germany. As Prussia is the largest state in Germany, its powerful police force will now be under central control, and the right to arrest and imprison criminals throughout the state will also belong to the central government. Of particular importance is that Germany's domestic policy was actually dominated by the Prussian state. Although General Goering will remain the Premier of Prussia, it will be a nominal title without real power. (1st Reuter's dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The salt field land tax in the Lianghuai, Liangzhe, and Changlu areas has always been collected by the Salt Affairs Administration. This income accounts for three-tenths of the Salt Affairs Administration's revenue. The Ministry of Finance believes that the various exorbitant taxes and levies in the provinces must be abolished, and reductions in land tax surcharges must also be supported. Although the detailed measures are subject to the decision of the National Fiscal Administration Conference, the provinces must not use the abolition of miscellaneous taxes and the reduction of surcharges as an excuse to affect local revenue. It is now proposed that the salt field land tax, which has always been a central revenue, be changed to a provincial tax revenue to offset the reduction of surcharges and the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies. The Ministry of Finance is currently drafting the details so that they can be submitted to the National Finance Conference for discussion. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e69">Yuehan Railway: Results of Drilling at the Location of the Lu River Bridge <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways believes that the issue of the location of the Lu River Bridge on the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Yuehan Railway has been delayed for a long time. Currently, the Yuehan Railway urgently needs to be completed. The Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau has been ordered to conduct drilling at the riverbed of the two bridge locations. Although the upstream line is 18 meters shorter in river width, the cost can be slightly reduced from the perspective of the bridge itself. The downstream line is 600 meters shorter, and the dam road padding is not as high or deep as the upstream. In terms of track laying, earthwork, drainage construction, and land acquisition, there will be more savings. Moreover, there are four fewer large and small culverts. The downstream line can save approximately 150,000 yuan in construction costs. The route is straighter, facilitating vehicle movement, and reducing road maintenance costs. The Ministry of Railways has ordered rapid construction to ensure early completion. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>London Silver: The London silver market was firm today. The spot price was quoted at 18 pence and 6875, up half a penny; the futures price was 18 pence and 8125, up 5625. China and the United States were buying, and India was selling. The closing market was uncertain.</p>
<p>American Silver: The New York silver market opened today (May 2nd) steady due to foreign telegraphs. Market participants seemed to be waiting for developments in Washington, and sentiment was good, as it was expected that the May buying trend of the past few days might resume. However, the market remained sluggish, with prices similar to London. Although there was talk that Senator Thomas might introduce a new silver amendment in the Senate, the silver market did not feel the impact of this. The opening prices for forward contracts were down 1 to 25 pounds compared to yesterday's closing prices, except for July, which was up three pounds.</p>

<p>Special Telegram: He Sheng Foreign Firm received a special telegram from London stating that the London Financial Times editorial first stated that the recent sharp drop in silver prices was mostly due to the United States' silver situation. It then stated that without a real improvement in the financial situation in India and China, it is impossible for silver prices to rise. Only after China and India prosper and recover will they have the power to purchase silver. The previous high silver prices only made China and India tend to sell silver, and needlessly increased the Chinese exchange rate, hindering trade, and delaying the real upward trend of silver.</p>

<p>The shells definitely have the characters "Taisho Year" on them.</p>
<p>The Changshu County Government has already sent the shells to the province.</p>
<p>Changshu News: Suddenly, on the afternoon of the 27th of last month, two gray warships passed by the Gaopu Estuary in the sixth district of this county. Unexpectedly, they opened fire on the shore with machine guns for about half an hour and fired dozens of cannons, causing panic. However, due to the heavy fog in the river, it was impossible to identify which country's warships they were. Subsequently, the police team stationed in the old Wushi Town recovered two artillery shells. The shells only had the marks "Wu", "Ke", and "　", making it difficult to identify them. The county sent police to send the shells to the provincial government for review. After this incident occurred, it attracted attention from all sides, and there were various rumors in the interior. A few days ago, the Zhenyu patrol ship Captain Ji reported that it might have been the Navy Survey Bureau firing on Tan Sha, but the Survey Bureau has now published a denial in the newspaper. Therefore, it is still difficult to guess which warship fired the shells and what their intentions were. On the 30th, the old Wushi District Office in the sixth district, due to the many shells fired by the warship that day, and the inevitable presence of remaining shells in the fields, which would cause future harm, ordered a detailed search. As expected, in the afternoon of that day, one shell was found in Tangyouche, and at the same time, Chen Zhengyang, a resident of the Nianbu Bridge, also found one shell. They were immediately sent to the district office, and Xu Shimin, an official from the district, was dispatched to send them to the county government. Upon inspection, one shell had already exploded (see the diagram of the shell on the right). The bottom was detached, the shell was one foot and one inch long, with 16 bee-like holes on the top and yellow soft paper attached to the bottom in a long oval shape, with printed numbers on it, but most of it was blurry. Upon inspection, the lower corners on both sides had "... Factory Weighing", with "Explosive Filling", "Shell Body", "A", and "75厶" printed in the middle. On the left side, there were characters such as "Fuse Amount 754 Tail Containing 厶". Another shell had not yet exploded. The soft paper attached to the shell had the characters "Taisho... Year" printed on it, which were clearly identifiable. Other characters were mostly blurry and difficult to identify (see the diagram of the shell on the left). The two shells weighed about ten pounds. Based on the characters on the shells, it would not be difficult to track down which warship fired them. The county government, because the two shells previously obtained did not have clear markings and could not prove which country's warship they were, now believes that the two shells with clear characters are of great importance. Therefore, Chen Fusheng, a bailiff, was sent again on the first shift of the boat on the 2nd to send the shells to the provincial government for future negotiations. At 10 PM on the evening of the 1st, the reporter went to the county government to visit County Magistrate Zhou Heng, but Zhou had returned to his residence. The Secretary-General was seen instead, and what he said was the same as above. He also said that the documents submitted to the province had already been drafted, which roughly stated, "The previously obtained shells have already been sent to the province. The two shells now obtained have characters such as 'Taisho... Year', which is sufficient to prove that the firing on the 27th was not the Navy Survey Bureau's shooting at Tan Sha, as stated by Captain Ji of the Zhenyu patrol ship."</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence, Military News: The pseudo 1359 Corps and the pseudo 5th Corps 13th Division gathered on the border of Nanfeng Guangchang. After our Third Route Army launched a series of fierce attacks, dozens of bandit bunkers were destroyed. In the battles on both sides of the Xu River, bandits were killed everywhere, and the strength of the bandits was completely lost. Our army occupied Guangchang City on the morning of the 28th. Wu Xinghan, the magistrate of Guangchang County, rushed from the province yesterday to take office to handle the reception and appeasement matters. The following is a record of Chen Cheng and Luo Zhuoying's telegram of victory: "Thanks to the time, this route army, with the Luo column along the west bank of the river, the Zhou column along the east bank of the river, and the Fan column as a reserve force, advanced from the area near Changxiang to attack Guangchang City. At 9 am, our various units successively broke through their first line of bunkers and occupied the highlands of Huangnitou, Qingshuitang, Taizi Temple, and Zhonghua Mountain, with captures. The bandits used the pseudo 13th Division to defend the east of the river, the pseudo 14th Division to defend the west of the river, and the second line of solid bunkers, gathering the strength of the 7th Division of the pseudo 139th Corps and hundreds of students from the pseudo Highway Infantry School, suddenly launched a counterattack against our divisions on the west bank, with great momentum. Our army immediately occupied positions and launched a fierce attack on the bandits, killing several pseudo regimental commanders. Bandit officers and soldiers suffered heavy casualties, but the bandits were extremely fierce and stubborn. From Si to Shen, they repeatedly charged us with dense formations, with repeated hand-to-hand combat, the battle was extremely fierce, unprecedented. In the evening, the bandits poured all their strength again and launched a fierce assault on us, making a final struggle. Our army took advantage of the strong wind and rain to launch a fierce attack. The bandits could not hold out, and completely collapsed on the morning of the 20th. The various units took advantage of the victory to pursue. We did occupy Guangchang City at Si that day. A certain division occupied the vicinity of Hedong. Most of the bandits fled towards Xin'an, and some towards Toupo Street. In this battle, more than 1,000 bandit staff officers and regimental commanders were captured alive, more than 6,000 bandits were killed or wounded, and more than 40 light and heavy machine guns and more than 20 rifles were seized. According to the captured bandits, the bandits were extremely embarrassed when they retreated, and their pseudo 2nd Division was completely wiped out. This is specially reported. Chen Cheng Luo Zhuoying Jian Shen Feng Zhan Yin,</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that our army captured Liu Zixiang, the instructor of the 13th Division of the pseudo 5th Corps, at Yunjizhai, who confessed that the commander of the 28th Regiment of the division was killed by our army in Xinqiao. The pseudo regiment instructor Tang Yin was acting as the commander, Battalion Commander Huang Yanbin, Company Commander Shang Tichai, were also captured. The bandit army lacked food and salt, and the hearts of the people were shaken, and they wanted to surrender, but they had no chance. According to the captured bandits, Zhang Shunqing, the commander of the pseudo 14th Division, was indeed shot in the waist twice and killed by the National Army while directing operations on the northwest highlands of Changsheng Bridge. It was also reported that a bandit officer who was bombed to death by our aircraft was seen on the southeast highlands of Zhukeng, carrying a map and binoculars with him. It was said to be a senior member of the pseudo 2nd Division. It was found that in this National Army's capture of Yunjizhai, Guanfuling, etc., more than 1,000 bandits were killed, and 129 rifles and muskets, 6 from Zilai, 1 from Bailanglin, and 11,500 rounds of ammunition were seized, and 3 company commanders, 1 political instructor, 5 platoon leaders, and 114 bandit soldiers of the pseudo 35th Corps were captured.

<h3 id="e98">Songjiang Wrongfully Accuses Good People of Theft and Uses Private Torture A Resident of Hougang Township, Shen Musheng, Voluntarily Surrendered to the Procuratorate <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>He accused the township chief of taking advantage of his power to oppress good people with false accusations of theft, and he bore visible injuries. It is said that Hougang Twenty-fifth Tuo is under the jurisdiction of Jinshan County, and there is a township chief named Ni Shoulin who usually intimidates the villagers and makes them afraid. This time, several pigs were stolen from his home, and he initially suspected Ni Sanhe of the same clan of stealing them. The township chief took a handgun and lime and went to question Ni Sanhe. Under duress, Ni Sanhe implicated Shen Musheng, the owner of a closed butcher shop. Township Chief Ni immediately went to arrest Shen Musheng and handed him over to the Hougang Police Station for detention. Shen categorically denied the charge. Ni, realizing his mistake, sent someone to release Shen, led him to his home, and privately tortured him by hanging him up and pressing him with large stones on his back, causing his toes to crack and visible injuries on his back. Still without a confession, he handed Shen over to the Songyin Sub-Station for thorough investigation. After questioning Ni Sanhe, Sanhe said that his life was related to the handgun and lime, and that he was forced to implicate Shen at the time. The Songyin Sub-Station then released Shen Musheng. Shen, feeling that he had been wrongly accused of theft and seriously injured, was unwilling and requested a thorough investigation and severe punishment. After the prosecutor Meng reviewed the case, he ordered that the case be transferred to the Jinshan County Government for punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Jiading A Large Number of Japanese Troops Arrive in Jiading At 2:30 PM on the Afternoon of the 30th Outside the East Gate Bus Station <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly, more than 70 soldiers from the Japanese Shanghai Special Naval Landing Force, divided into Vehicles No. 1 and No. 5, and five officers, including Kashiwagi Setsu Akiyoshi Takeji, etc., in a small truck, came to Jiading from Shanghai. Vehicle No. 1 had the license plates of the Municipal Government 12301 and the Concession 5637. Vehicle No. 5 had the license plates of the Municipal Government 12302 and the Concession 5632. The small truck had the license plates of the Municipal Government 9772 and the Concession 5518. The soldiers were all wearing blue uniforms, and the officers were all wearing plain clothes. After arriving at the station, the patrol police reported to the county Public Security Bureau by telephone, which then reported to the county government. County Magistrate Xu Cixuan immediately ordered Public Security Bureau Supervisor Bao Jing to lead the police to inquire about their intentions and ask for official documents. Kashiwagi Setsu replied that he had no official documents and was here for sightseeing and wanted to enter the city. Bao, on the grounds that foreigners were not allowed to enter the interior without permits, and that a large number of foreign soldiers entering the city could easily cause public panic and suspicion, politely refused. The soldiers played at the station for a while, and then took the original vehicles back to Shanghai at about 3:00 PM. The five officers, including Kashiwagi Setsu, insisted on entering the city. Bao then accompanied them while secretly monitoring them. In front of Tayuan, they wanted to go to the Jinsha Pagoda to climb up and look around, but Bao politely refused on the grounds that the pagoda gate was closed and visitors were not allowed to enter. Then they went to Kuishan Park and toured the Confucius Temple and the Tanying Pavilion. At 4:20 PM, they left the park and, returning through Dongda Street, Kashiwagi picked up a brick and wrote the ten characters "Jiading is good, clean, and interesting" on the ground on the ground of Zhu Meiyuan. At 5:00 PM, they took the original truck back to Shanghai. When saying goodbye to Bao at the station, they gave Bao a bottle each of malt liquor and fruit dew, which Bao firmly declined but was unable to refuse, and then took it to the bureau to report the case. Public Security Bureau Chief Xue Bingyang immediately reported the incident of the Japanese troops' arrival in Jiading to the county government. County Magistrate Xu believed that a large number of foreign troops had deeply penetrated the interior, and even though they claimed to be sightseeing, they might be violating the agreement and might have other purposes. That night, he telegraphed the situation to the Department of Civil Affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Changshu: Disputes Arise from the Investigation of Provincial Telephones <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Changshu telephone communication system has historically had three branches: ordinary urban area shops and residential telephones, which were installed by a commercially-run joint-stock company around the seventh or eighth year of the Republic. This company was registered and directly subordinate to the Ministry of Transportation. Subsequently, due to frequent reports of banditry and police matters in various townships, the local authorities, for the sake of prompt communication, specifically erected poles and strung up urban and rural telephones. They established exchanges in the urban area and larger towns in the east and west, dedicated to switchboard operations. These exchanges were managed by the county government's construction section. The Construction Department, aiming to connect various provinces and counties for communication purposes, also established a provincial long-distance telephone bureau the year before last. All counties along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line were to have exchanges set up, with Changshu included in this initiative. However, since the establishment of the provincial telephone bureau, users have preferred dealing with the provincial bureau because of its faster connection times, clearer sound quality, and lower fees. This has greatly impacted the long-distance telephone business of the commercially-run company. Nevertheless, the provincial bureau's telephone system only has one exchange, unlike the commercially-run company, which can directly communicate with users. Consequently, the commercial bureau and the provincial bureau are as incompatible as fire and water. When the urban and rural telephone bureau was established, due to its county-run status, the commercial bureau had lent the "722," "723," and "442" lines for use by the urban and rural lines. Regardless of location, one only needed to connect to the above three lines to transfer to the township area, unlike the provincial bureau, where one had to go to the bureau to make a call. Now, these urban and rural telephones have been ordered to be incorporated into the provincial bureau, and Dan Bao-ci has been dispatched to Changshu to take over. However, the original county commercial company and the provincial telephone bureau were in the aforementioned incompatible situation. After the township telephones were taken over by the province, a problem arose concerning the previously lent "722," "723," and "442" lines. The board of directors resolved to dismantle the three lines, refusing to allow transfers to urban area users. The new chairman, Dan Bao-ci, recognizing that such a decisive move by the commercial company would inevitably create a disconnect with urban and rural users, repeatedly negotiated. The commercial bureau then sought instructions from the Ministry of Transportation, and has now received a reply, stating roughly: "The county urban and rural telephone system is of a long-distance nature. The company's unauthorized connection violates Article 10 of the connection contract. Considering it is the first offense, no further action will be taken. The three lines connecting to the county exchange must be dismantled, and no further connections with any other telephone lines are permitted."</p>

<p>At six o'clock this morning (the 2nd), the home of Yu Canrong in Cai Family Courtyard near Da Fu Bridge in Wuyi City was suddenly entered by three bandits. One bandit stood guard outside the door, while two bandits went inside and knocked on Yu's bedroom door. Yu, not thinking much of it, got up and opened the door. Unexpectedly, one of the bandits immediately pointed a gun at him. Yu, realizing the situation was dire, threw over a hundred yuan in paper money from his belly pocket to the bandits. The bandits then forced open the iron cabinet, taking nine hundred yuan in paper money and two hundred jiao in change from the cabinet. After hiding the money, they repeatedly shot Yu Canrong with a handgun, inflicting nine bullet wounds, causing him to collapse and die near the chamber pot. Before leaving, the bandits rummaged through the boxes, seizing joint receipts and other documents. The few items left behind were stained with blood. They then escaped through the back door. Afterwards, the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Inspector Chen Rui and police officers to investigate. They immediately telegraphed all public security agencies to jointly apprehend the bandits and searched the train station and various hotels, but without success. It is reported that the deceased Yu Canrong ran a butcher shop and was a leader in the industry. His unexpected death in the city has shocked everyone.</p>

<p>The incident of a live buried girl discovered outside the East Gate of Wuyi on the 30th has caused a sensation throughout the city, with everyone considering it a strange occurrence. After investigation, it was found that a boatman named Lu Shi had taken in a seven or eight-month-old girl around February of this year. However, the child recently fell ill, and Lu Shi did not provide medical treatment. On the evening of the 29th of last month, he took a reed mat and hid the child inside, abandoning her near the tomb of Bai Shangshu. Around 10 a.m. on the 30th, Zhou Panbao was passing by the area when he suddenly heard the sound of a child crying from the tomb. He went closer to investigate and saw a long snake surrounding a reed mat with a crying child inside. Several wild dogs were also on the bank of the tomb, seemingly trying to jump in and eat the child inside the mat. Zhou was quite alarmed and reported it to the local police. The police then retrieved the child from the tomb and brought Lu Shi from his boat to the precinct for questioning. The precinct inspector sent the child to the orphanage for care, while Lu Shi was sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Several days ago, Yan Zhenfu returned from Yangzhou, and suddenly disappeared that night. His family was extremely anxious and searched everywhere. On the afternoon of the 30th, a large pool of fresh blood was found on the dike. Following the trail of blood for about half a li, no body or other traces were found. However, his family and relatives believed that Yan had been targeted a few days before his disappearance at Bajangkou, where someone had attempted to assassinate him with a handgun. Fortunately, he had rolled into a ditch by the roadside, escaping unharmed. He had told his relatives and friends to avenge him if anything unfortunate happened. Now that he was missing and there was blood, they were certain that he had been assassinated. They are currently making efforts to investigate the location of the body and the murderer. It is also rumored that Yan had been dismembered into eight pieces and thrown into the river to cover up the traces, but it is unknown if this is true.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Commemoration of May First Labor Day the Day Before Yesterday - City General Labor Union Convenes a General Assembly - Factories Close with Wages Paid as Usual - Chinese and Foreign Concession Military Police Increase Precautions <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>May 1st is International Labor Day. The City General Labor Union specifically convened a general assembly of representatives from various city labor unions at 10 a.m. on this day in the auditorium of the union's headquarters on Fuyou Road to commemorate the occasion. The City Party Department dispatched Committee Member Lu Jingshi to attend and provide guidance, and he delivered a poignant speech. All factories throughout the city closed for one day, with wages still paid as usual. The military police authorities of both the Chinese and Foreign Concessions took extra precautions. The details of these events are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Representatives Present <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The following labor unions were represented: Sixth District Paper Industry, Sixth District Water and Electricity Industry, Leather Manufacturing Industry, Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry, Sauce Industry, New-Style Laundry and Dyeing Industry, First District Cosmetics Industry, Dried Goods Industry, Tenth District Cotton Spinning Industry, Pharmaceutical Industry, Second District Knitting Industry, Candle Industry, Lithography Industry, Fourth District Water and Electricity Industry, Fourth District Cigarette Industry, Automobile Driver Industry, Pharmacy Industry, Musical Instrument Industry, First District Shipbuilding Industry, Third District Rubber Industry, Postal Service. Representatives included Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Long Peiyun, Zhao Zhenhui, Lu Muqin, Yu Yaoqiu, Zhong Xiaobao, and others, totaling over two hundred people.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Chairman's Report <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>After ringing the bell to start the meeting and performing the rituals, Chairman Zhu Xuefan first gave a report, stating roughly: "May 1st is International Labor Day. On May 1, 1886, the workers of Chicago, USA, called for improved treatment and convened workers throughout the city, demanding that employers implement the 'three eights' system. However, due to the oppression of capitalists at the time, this was not immediately realized. The following year, American workers held even larger demonstrations and were able to implement it. After the US implemented it, European countries followed suit. Today, almost all countries in the world adhere to the 'three eights' system. In the US, there is even the implementation of six-hour workdays. The lives of our country's workers involve working more than twelve hours, and the wages earned are not enough to support a family. The reason why our country's labor movement has not developed as evenly as those in other countries is that China has been deeply invaded by various imperialists, causing China's industry to decline. Therefore, if we want to commemorate May 1st, our workers must unite, strengthen our own power, stand on the position of national rejuvenation, and break all imperialist acts of aggression. Especially since Shanghai is the economic center of the country, all of us workers should be a model for the whole country, unite our strength, and work hard for national rejuvenation."</p>
<h3 id="e112">Party Department's Address <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, Lu Jingshi, a representative of the City Party Department, gave a speech, stating roughly: "Today is May 1st, and all workers throughout the country and even the world are holding grand commemorative assemblies on this day because May 1st is the day when workers transitioned from an inhuman life to a human life. In the past, the lives of workers in various countries were the same as the current lives of workers in China. The American workers first became aware and staged powerful demonstrations, so the 'three eights' system was implemented and gradually promoted throughout the world. Therefore, May 1st has fully developed the world's labor movement on one hand, and on the other hand, it has also promoted China's labor movement. I have some opinions on China's labor movement that I will express here. The Communist Party uses the phrase 'workers have no homeland' to lure workers. However, when we look at the workers in the Soviet Union, in addition to working eight hours, they add two hours to intensify work for the country's national defense and production construction. Other countries such as Germany, France, England, and Japan are even more advanced than this. Therefore, in this tense international situation and with the national crisis so urgent, our workers should work even harder for the country. Finally, I would like to offer two concrete suggestions: (1) I hope that in the shortest possible time, all workers in the city will be able to enjoy eight hours of education opportunities. Although the City Party Department and the General Labor Union have already established more than twenty labor schools, they are not enough to distribute among the city's large number of workers, and the fact that many of the city's workers still lack knowledge should be addressed in the shortest possible time. (2) Since we understand that the reason for the backwardness of all industries in China is the result of imperialist aggression, all of us workers should intensify production and unite our strength to resist foreign aggression for the sake of national rejuvenation. If we do so, domestic goods can compete with foreign goods, and the sales of domestic goods will mean there is hope for industrial development, and the improvement of workers' lives can also be achieved."</p>
<h3 id="e113">Silver Syndicate Undertakes Italian Boxer Indemnity Loan - Ministry of Finance Issued Certificates Yesterday - Certificates Are Equivalent to Ordinary IOUs - Certificate Holders Can Freely Mortgage Them <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>However, considerable restrictions apply when borrowing from the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The sixteen banks in the city, which previously lent 44 million to the Ministry of Finance, originally planned to issue 30 million in securities to recover a portion of the loan. Now, the Ministry of Finance believes that the issuance of these securities would hinder the credit of government bonds. Previously, it sent personnel to Shanghai to discuss changing the issuance to be done by the ministry, and both parties have reached an understanding. The loan syndicate has stopped proceeding. The Italian Boxer Indemnity loan certificates (i.e., IOUs) that should be issued to the syndicate were officially issued yesterday by the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Office and handed over to the syndicate. A reporter from the Shishi News Agency specifically investigated and recorded the details below.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Issuance of Loan Certificates <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The total number of these certificates issued by the Ministry of Finance is 44 million, named "Ministry of Finance Italian Boxer Indemnity Loan Certificates," which are ordinary IOUs. The face value of the certificates is divided into two types: 10,000 yuan and 1,000 yuan. When the loan was established, these should have been immediately handed over to the syndicate as collateral for the issuance of 30 million in securities. However, due to the large number and the time required to fill in the month on each paper, the issuance was only completed now. They have now all been handed over to the syndicate for safekeeping. If the various banks need the certificates, they can extract them for use at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Loan Repayment and Interest <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance pre-printed the month and year on the face of the loan certificates, and each paper is different. When repaying the principal and interest, the certificate will be recovered. In the future, the Ministry of Finance will allocate a certain amount to repay the syndicate's loan and recover a certain number of certificates. The Ministry of Finance's repayment schedule can be roughly divided into three phases. The first phase is from January of this year to the end of 1940, with a monthly repayment of 375,000 yuan. The second phase is in 1941, with a monthly repayment of 275,000 yuan. The third phase is from January 1942 to the end of January 1945, with a monthly repayment of 250,000 yuan. When the entire loan is repaid, all certificates will be recovered by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Utility of Loan Certificates <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Loan certificates are different in nature from public bonds and cannot be bought and sold on the stock exchange. However, due to the reliability of the funds, the banks can freely mortgage them and borrow cash from the Central Bank to avoid financial delays. However, the Ministry of Finance also has considerable restrictions on borrowing cash from the Central Bank using these certificates. According to what the Shishi News Agency reporter learned from some sources, the Ministry of Finance's reply to the syndicate stated that the certificates could be used to borrow cash from the Central Bank, but the market situation must be taken into consideration. This means that in today's period of loose money supply, there is no need for mutual borrowing between the Central Bank and the various banks. However, if financial conditions become tight and turnover is not smooth, the Central Bank will not be an exception. Whether or not it is permitted is completely uncertain. Therefore, the utility of these certificates is only equivalent to that of ordinary IOUs and does not have any superior status.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Radio and Telegraph Merger - Implemented Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Telegraph Bureau Director Wu Baofeng and Chief Engineer Yu Ruxin went to Beijing to request instructions from the Ministry of Transportation regarding the merger. This has now been completed, and they returned to Shanghai one after the other yesterday. Although the Radio and Telegraph merger was scheduled to be implemented on the day before yesterday (the 1st), it was only officially realized yesterday afternoon. The original location of the Radio General Station on Minquan Road will be used by the bureau's engineering department to conduct business.

<h3 id="e121">Li Shijia Arrived in Shanghai from Fujian Yesterday to Discuss - The Japanese Are Plotting a Desperate Secret Attack on South China - Li Will Go to Beijing Tonight to Report Everything to the Navy Headquarters <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Li Shijia, a member of the Fujian Provincial Government and commander of the Majiang naval base, was previously ordered by the Navy Headquarters to inspect the Marine Corps stationed in Fujian and to suppress pirates in the Fujian waters. Now that the inspection is complete and the coastal bandits have been gradually suppressed, he took the Huaan merchant ship from Fujian to Shanghai the day before yesterday and will transfer to Beijing to report everything to the Navy Headquarters. A reporter from the Riri News Agency visited Li at his residence yesterday morning and asked him about the details of the bandit suppression, the reorganization of the land forces, the Japanese conspiracy to secretly attack South China, and the recent political situation in Fujian Province. He provided a detailed account, which is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e122">The Japanese Increasingly Covet South China <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Li first stated that the recent diplomatic situation is becoming increasingly tense. However, the general public is focusing on Japan's invasion of North China and neglecting Japan's conspiracy in South China. Japan's threat to North China is still obvious, but its secret attack on the South is intensifying step by step, with various cunning tricks, deceiving on the east and attacking on the west. Its intentions are unfathomable and hearing about them is quite frightening. The current situation is fraught with crises, and our country's government and public cannot afford to ignore it.</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Process of Suppressing Coastal Bandits <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The coastal pirates in Fujian Province were originally very rampant. Furthermore, after the puppet government promoted the division of land, the local communists became even more active. In places such as Lianjiang, Huangqi, Mabi, Luoyuan, Fuying Island, and Changle and Wenao Island, the bandits were rampant. Starting on March 13, when I went to various places to inspect the land forces, I led the various ships to gradually pacify the communists. We successively destroyed more than ten Soviet governments in districts and towns, killed hundreds of local communists, and captured over a thousand firearms. Important bandits have been sent to the province and will be interrogated by the Security Department. There are currently no traces of bandits or communists in the coastal areas.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Actively Reorganizing the Land Forces <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Marine Corps was established in 1922. Initially, there was only one brigade with two regiments, which was later expanded to ten regiments. However, during the reorganization and reduction, four regiments were eliminated. There are currently two brigades with four regiments. In the past, due to local political relations, the land forces were mostly stationed in the coastal areas of Fujian Province to capture pirates. They were once transferred to Xiangshan in Nanjing for training, but later, due to the Fujian Incident, they were transferred back to Fujian Province. After I took over the land forces, I decided to thoroughly reorganize them to make them a strong force. I decided to start with education and have established a military academy to train junior officers.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Recent Political Situation in Fujian Province <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Since the Nineteenth Route Army rebellion, Fujian Province has been plagued by bandits everywhere and the financial situation has been extremely chaotic. Since the establishment of the provincial government, it has first reorganized the militias of various counties, forming sixteen security teams. However, since the reorganization was just beginning, there were inevitably disparities. After resolving the Chen Yucai, Lin Jing, and other units with poor discipline, the other units are currently being trained. Although local finances are subsidized by the central government, the amount is limited and insufficient. The provincial government is now making every effort to economize. Other matters such as disaster relief and local autonomy are also being handled in order. I am scheduled to take the night train to Beijing on the evening of the 3rd.</p>

<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, International Labor Day has been designated by German Chancellor Hitler as German Brownshirt Labor Pioneer Commemoration Day. The entire German community in Shanghai specifically held the first celebration and commemoration the day before yesterday. The enthusiasm was unprecedented. The celebration and commemoration was held all day the day before yesterday. Starting at 8 a.m. in the morning, the German Acting Consul General in Shanghai, Bai Rende, led many Brownshirt party members to hold a flag-raising ceremony at the German Consulate on the Waibaidu Bridge. Bai is a permanent member of the party. During the ceremony, all members, except Bai himself, wore Brownshirts and raised their right hands, saluting the Brownshirt Party and singing the party song to show their lifelong loyalty to their party and country. Then, from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., a celebration ceremony was held at the German school, attended by over a thousand German men and women, school students, and young children. All members wore Brownshirt uniforms. There was a luncheon at noon, ball games in the afternoon, and a dance party in the evening. The enthusiasm was an unprecedented spectacle for the German community in Shanghai. The loyalty of the German people to Hitler can be imagined from this.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Loud Protests from Various Groups Against Japanese Declarations <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Last month, on the 17th, Japan issued an unofficial statement, and its diplomats also successively made speeches, which aroused criticism from various European and American countries. Our government has also made some representations.</p>
<p>Various groups in Shanghai have recently begun to issue telegrams expressing their opinions, which are summarized below:</p>
<p>City General Labor Union: Based on the resolution passed at the third re-election conference on the 28th of last month, yesterday, an important telegram was drafted and sent, stating: "According to reports, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota issued an unofficial statement, actually regarding our country as its protectorate, and claiming that friendly relations between other countries and us must be subject to Japan's permission. This is not only an insult to our national dignity, but also a disregard for the good faith of international agreements. Our country is an independent nation, and it has its inherent power and ability to maintain friendly relations with other countries, and it is not subject to interference from any party. This absurd statement by Japan is sufficient to expose its ambition to annex China and dominate Asia, and to undermine peace in East Asia. As long as a single breath remains in Shanghai's labor community, we will vow to oppose it to the death. We hope that workers across the country will rise up together and work hard to respond to the serious national crisis and save the national crisis. The telegram expresses the utmost urgency. Respectfully, Shanghai General Labor Union."</p>
<p>Citizens' Branch: The Eleventh District Branch of the First Special District Citizens' Federation issued a declaration yesterday, stating: "Fellow compatriots across the country, since the Tanggu Truce, public opinion in our country has been silenced and national spirit has declined. Those who are greedy and insatiable will not be able to gain an inch and advance a foot. Four provinces have been slaughtered, and diplomacy has been subjected to control. Its declaration on April 17th directly regards us as a non-autonomous country. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Legislator Lou Tongsun advocates actively resisting Japan, so as to stimulate national spirit and effectively resist insults, and forge a path to survival. His earnest words are worthy of emulation. We believe that if the national spirit continues to decline in this way, it will inevitably make people more and more oppressed, and the country will perish in no time. We hope that our compatriots will quickly urge the government to immediately protest to Japan and seek ways to save ourselves. The eagerness is beyond expression."</p>
<p>Sichuan Fellow Provincial Association: The Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Provincial Association telegraphed the whole country yesterday, stating (title omitted): "Everyone, The violent Japanese are invading, and our rivers and mountains are broken. Three years have passed, and the trauma is still fresh. We have been enduring hardship and resisting for a long time. The Japanese, however, are gaining an inch and advancing a foot, and absurd theories are rampant. On April 17th and several times thereafter, Japanese diplomatic personnel at home and abroad successively issued declarations, statements, and talks, claiming that China is not allowed to intervene in, opposing cooperation between countries, and openly advocating that Japan has special responsibilities for East Asia and China. China's diplomatic actions towards other countries must obtain Japan's consent, and it is hoped that various countries will recognize the 'Manchukuo's' just and free actions, and so on. These barbaric and unreasonable words that despise our nation and country, anyone with blood and spirit will not be able to hear them without glaring eyes and a torn canthus, rising up to resist. Our independent great power has its own complete territory, and in foreign affairs, it has its own independent, free, and equal sovereignty. How can Japan invade and occupy land, support puppet states, disregard sovereignty, and interfere arbitrarily? Japan had already invaded and occupied our northeastern territory in the past, and now it is further interfering in our foreign sovereignty. Its ambition to despise our nation and destroy our country is obvious. Now, the great powers are clamoring with dissatisfaction with its declaration. All of us people should urge the government to lodge protests to Japan and declare to the world that the four northeastern provinces still belong to our country, and we will never recognize the existence of the puppet state of Manchukuo. Our Republic of China has the sovereign right to be independent and autonomous in foreign affairs, and we will never allow interference from a second country, so as to curb the ambition of the violent Japanese and correct the world's view. We, the people ourselves, should work hard to build, promote production, and maintain transportation, so as to achieve the initial aspirations of ten years of recuperation and promote the rebirth of the nation. National rights are broken, and the nation is in danger. All of us compatriots, why not rise up? Respectfully, Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Provincial Association, Dong Yin."</p>

<h3 id="e128">Peide Lane: Tenant Petition for Water Restoration; Negotiations with the Public Works Department and Water Company Ineffective <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Since Peide Lane on Xin Zha Road was illegally cut off from water by the owner, Xunshi, colluding with the British Shanghai Water Company, negotiations with the Public Works Department and the water company have been ineffective. Representatives of the lane believe that if this continues, tragedy is inevitable. Yesterday, they petitioned the Party and government organs. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e129">Yesterday's Petition <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>At 7:00 AM yesterday, all tenants planned to obtain water from the Catholic Church, using firecrackers as a signal. When the priests inside the church heard the sound of firecrackers, they immediately connected the hose to the outside of the door, in view of the previous day's violent failure. Then, they elected six representatives, Wang Jieqing, Leng Bingnan, Liu Xinfu, Huang Yaozu, Zhang Yuwen, and Liu Chengyong, to carry a petition to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, and the Social Affairs Bureau to request relief. Zhang Mengling of the Foreign Affairs Office, Huang Yangren of the Municipal Party Department, Xiang Wei of the Municipal Government, and Sun Yongyi of the Social Affairs Bureau received them. After the representatives stated their intentions, they all agreed to vigorously negotiate with the Public Works Department to restore water immediately to maintain people's lives. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Ineffective Negotiations <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>On the Public Works Department side, Acting Lawyer Wang Xianggu still went to negotiate, but Public Works Department Director Zhong Si's statements all sided with the water company and did not agree to the request, so there was still no result. On the water company side, they were asked to pay attention to the obligations stipulated in the treaty, but they distorted the English clauses to protect the owner in every possible way, so they also did not get the point.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Petition <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Representatives of the lane presented to the Party and government organs yesterday, stating: "We respectfully submit this petition regarding the cruel and unlawful act of the Shanghai Water Company of the Public Concession, cutting off water and forcing people to their deaths. We request that you promptly and seriously negotiate with the Public Works Department and order the immediate restoration of water to maintain people's lives and protect public safety. We, the undersigned, are the representatives publicly elected by all the tenants of Peide Lane on Xin Zha Road. We have lived in this lane for many years. There are a total of 116 houses in the lane, each with two or three tenants or several families, totaling more than 3,000 people. The water used is supplied by the British Shanghai Water Company, and the water fee is paid by the landlord, the Catholic Church, from the rent. In the 19th year of the Republic, the water rate increased, and each household has been increased by one yuan. However, this is not a fee that the tenants should pay, but they understand the difficulties and have not argued. Unexpectedly, the landlord is gaining an inch and advancing a foot, and ordered the gatekeeper to verbally notify each household to increase the water fee by five yuan. The tenants believe that this is so greedy and insatiable, and it is too unreasonable. They immediately refused sternly. The landlord, the Catholic Church, because its desire was not fulfilled, instigated the water company to send registered mail, urging each household to install water meters separately. The tenants, because they had not received written notice from the landlord in advance, stopped paying for water supply, and the landlord did not fairly deduct the water fee from the rent, so it was inconvenient to install water meters separately. They were also afraid of misunderstandings, and sent representatives to the company to explain and earnestly requested that before this dispute is resolved, if the water fee is refused to be paid by the landlords, the tenants are willing to pay in full and provide reliable security. They pleaded repeatedly, but the company insisted on sophistry and could not reverse its determination to install water meters separately within a time limit. They had to go to the landlord, the Catholic Church, for consultation, but they were also rejected and ignored. All kinds of situations show that they are colluding to oppress and act as accomplices. Although the tenants are weak, if they are not treated fairly, it is difficult to be oppressed and subdued by their improper forces. Unexpectedly, the water company saw that its plan did not succeed, and on the morning of the 24th of last month, at 9:00 AM, it brazenly disregarded everything, suddenly sent several workers, closed the water gate, and cut off the water, intending to put more than 3,000 tenants in the entire lane to death, to show its vicious and cruel means to achieve its private plot of pressing for additional fees. According to a clause in the exclusive contract between the water company and the Public Works Department on March 17, 1928, translated as 'In houses where water fees have not been paid, if there are people living in the house, the water company may not, at the request of the landlord, cut off the water supply to all or part of the house, but the landlord is not thereby relieved of its responsibility to pay all water fees.' According to the original meaning of this contract, there is a restriction on the water company's abuse of power and protection of the public interest. Even if there is a request from the landlord, the water company may not follow the water cut, the regulations are very clear. Moreover, the tenants are willing to pay the water fee, and there is no reason to refuse the water supply. Unexpectedly, the water company disregards the law and does not follow reason, and uses the water on which the lives of more than one million citizens in the concession depend as a tool to oppress and add fees and blackmail at will. If it fails slightly, it threatens to cut off the water. Similar incidents have occurred repeatedly. Although citizens have appealed repeatedly, the Public Works Department has turned a blind eye and turned a deaf ear. In this situation, Chinese people in our concession not only have no explicitly stipulated behavior and are bullied everywhere, but also lose the effect of protection even with an explicitly stipulated exclusive contract. Such behavior not only treats Peide Lane tenants like fish and meat, but also treats the entire concession's compatriots and citizens as if they are no one. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? If this is not fought for, what can be fought for? Also, because the water has been cut off for seven days, the situation is urgent. The matter of unreasonable oppression in Peide Lane is small, but harming the entire national system is a big matter. Therefore, we present this special report, earnestly requesting your government to examine and verify, and request that you promptly and seriously negotiate with the Public Works Department, and order the water company to immediately restore the water supply, and prevent similar inhuman acts from happening again in the future, so as to maintain the lives of the people and protect sovereignty. This is truly a virtue. We respectfully submit this report to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Social Affairs Bureau with the utmost urgency."</p>

<p>After the September 18th Incident, Xiang was angered by the precarious state of the country and participated in the organization of volunteer armies, which aroused the jealousy of the enemy. On the evening of the January 28th Shanghai Incident, eleven employees of Wuzhou Store were captured by the enemy. Xiang rushed to rescue them and was also arrested by the enemy. In the end, he was killed by the enemy and his body was destroyed. Until recently, it has not been possible to find them. The brutality of the violent Japanese against our compatriots is truly tragic.</p>

<p>Xiang sacrificed his life for the country this time, and important people and celebrities have all written eulogies. Excerpts are selected below: "Clothes and hat remain with integrity, gibbons and cranes mourn with sorrow." Written by Yu Youren. "Scolding the enemy and resisting, the righteousness of thousands of years will last forever; entrusting life in danger, a few lines of posthumous writings are truly precious." Written by Wu Tiecheng. "His career is like Han Kang's, and for thirty years he has been known as a chivalrous man throughout the seas; a brave teacher and pioneer, ten generations of fame are equal to dying in peace." Written by Kong Xiangxi. "Invaded by bandits, rivers and mountains are broken, generously throwing their heads, the army is dyed with Hong blood; clothes and hat are desolate, souls are vast, tears of sadness fall, it is difficult for Yuan Zhen to return to the fortress." Written by Lin Kanghou. Other elegiac writings filled the walls and courtyard of the Siming Guild Hall, every word provoking indignation and every word containing bloody tears.

<p>Xiang's coffin containing his clothes and hat was carried out for burial at 9:00 AM yesterday. The route started from his residence at the Wuzhou Gu Ben Factory in Xujiahui, passed Jinji Bridge to the west, turned north and east, took Beidang Road, passed Lafayette Road and Heping Road, to the north of Lao Ximen, passed the Siming Guild Hall, east along Minguo Road to Xiaodongmen, and went straight to Ningshao Wharf to board the Xin Ningshao Wheel and transport it back to his hometown, where the date of burial will be determined. More than a thousand people held the rope and escorted the funeral procession that day. It was originally planned to pass in front of the Wuzhou Pharmacy on Henan Road in the Public Concession, but due to the regulations of the Public Works Department, the number of people in the funeral procession could not exceed 300. However, it was impossible to limit the number of people in Xiang's funeral procession to 300. Moreover, the journey from Xujiahui to the east was not short, so it was abandoned. However, it was still the utmost honor and sorrow.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Ji Zexin, director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, told reporters that foreign merchants often send letters to the bureau requesting the introduction of national products for sale abroad, hoping that Chinese merchants will contact them for sales. The goods needed by various countries are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e147">Egg Products <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the chicken farming industry in various countries has developed rapidly, and the production of eggs has been increasing daily. Therefore, tariffs have been raised to protect them, which has affected China's egg industry. Now, the South African John Moore Company needs high-quality egg yolk and dry egg white to manufacture food. The company plans to purchase raw materials in China, and egg merchants can quote prices to contact them.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Matches <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The American Poos Old Brothers Company wrote to the bureau stating that they originally sold Japanese matches, but the Japanese goods were too thin and inconvenient to use. They heard that China has high-quality coarse-stalk matches and are very willing to promote them. They hope that match merchants will select samples and list prices to contact them.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Pine Needle Oil <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>A certain import company in Hamburg, Germany, needs 100 loads of pine needle oil. The company originally purchased from various parts of Siberia and is now willing to purchase from China. Domestic pine needle oil merchants can send samples for promotion.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Maritime Administration: Ship Collision Meeting Held the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Ship Collision Dispute Handling Committee of the Shanghai Maritime Administration of the Ministry of Communications held its eleventh meeting at the bureau at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 1st). Attendees included Peng Hu, Chen Ganqing, Xu Jijie, He Daoyun, Zhang Gui, etc. Chen Baoyan attended as an observer. Peng Hu chaired the meeting and resolved the following cases: (1) Continued discussion of the case of the Hengshan Wheel of the Sanbei Wheel Company sinking the Dingsheng Steamer, resolved: The Hengshan Wheel has not yet arrived in Shanghai, and the wheel's second mate and helmsman were unable to attend the meeting for questioning. This case will be left for discussion at the next meeting, (2) Continued discussion of the collision case between the Chuanshan Wheel of the Chuanshan Wheel Company and the Changyuan Wood Vessel Jin Changsen Sailboat off the coast of Shipu Port in Zhejiang, resolved: According to the reports and testimonies of the two ships, (A) On the Chuanshan Wheel side, after Chuanshan saw the white light and sail shadow in front, it clearly knew that a sailboat was coming. After checking that the wind direction at that time was north-north-west, the bow of the Chuanshan should have been slightly to the left (upwind side) to give way. (According to the Chuanshan chief mate, there were still more than 1,000 feet to the left of Land Mountain,) but at that time, the Chuanshan turned to the right to avoid, and the measures were indeed inappropriate, (B) On the sailboat side, it was said that one light turned into a collision in a flash, which seems to be inconsistent with the facts. The position and direction of the two ships, the sailboat should have seen the red light early after seeing the green light and before the "harmonious" collision, because between when the two ships met (facing each other) and when they collided (almost parallel), the red light should have been seen, but the sailboat failed to pay full attention and take the opportunity to avoid, and only turned to the left, which was also inappropriate. As for its use of gunfire instead of shouts for help, which injured Chuanshan with bullets, although it was not related to driving, this kind of behavior was absurd. According to the above situation, the Chuanshan Wheel should bear 60% of the fault, and the Jin Changsen Sailboat should bear 40% of the fault, (3) The case of the Fuzhou Small Wheel of the Xincheng Wheel Bureau being sunk near the Longjusha Beach Mouth in Jiangyin, resolved: According to four reasons, (lengthy words omitted), the Fuzhou Small Wheel was not sunk by the Jing'an Wheel, (4) Interrogation of Boatman Meng Afu, resolved: (A) Inform the Taikoo Company to send the report of the Wuxue Wheel captain to the bureau, and inform the captain to attend the meeting for questioning at the next meeting, (B) At the same time, send a letter to the Jianghai Customs Commissioner to send the harbor master's report on this case to the bureau, (C) After the reports from the above two parties are received, a public judgment will be made on a scheduled date.</p>

<p>Taiping Lane on the road in the 16th Ward of the Southern District has been actively engaged in rent reduction efforts since the establishment of the Rent Reduction Support Association, with Jin Chuxiang as the executive director, without any slackening. The houses in this lane were built after the January 28th Incident.

<h3 id="e153">Dispute Over Rickshaw Licenses in the French Concession: Progress of Negotiations by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Representatives of rickshaw operators in the city, Zhang Huaiyang, and others, submitted a petition to the municipal government requesting assistance in negotiations regarding the sudden restrictions imposed on rickshaw licenses recently issued by the French Concession, which resulted in some operators being unable to obtain licenses and operate. The municipal government ordered the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to handle the matter. Subsequently, the bureau sent personnel to contact the French Concession authorities. It was reported that the French Concession has never restricted the issuance of rickshaw licenses. New licenses are issued during the first four days of each month (i.e., from the 1st to the 4th) on a first-come, first-served basis. All districts of Shanghai, including French Shanghai, South Shanghai, North Shanghai, and West Shanghai, can preferentially obtain French Concession licenses. The total number of licenses issued each month is less than 17,000. Therefore, on March 6, 1933, the Board of Directors of the French Municipal Council decided to limit the number to 17,000. However, recently, after the war in Zhabei, the city's situation has deteriorated. Many rickshaw pullers from there have come to the Southern City to operate and obtain French licenses nearby. The situation is similar in West Shanghai, resulting in exceeding the quota. As a result of the negotiations, the French Concession authorities agreed to issue an additional 150 licenses, but the Rickshaw Trade Association must first submit the application to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, which will forward it to the French Municipal Council. The council will then devise a method to request the French Consul General in Shanghai to increase the number of rickshaw licenses by 150, which will still be sent to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association for transfer to the Rickshaw Trade Association to be responsible for distribution. The association and others will guarantee that they will not request additional licenses, etc. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has reported this to the municipal government and ordered the Rickshaw Trade Association to comply and properly distribute the licenses, it is said.</p>

<p>During the meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the afternoon of May 2, the organizational structure of the Rickshaw Management Office was discussed. It was decided that the three administrators of the office would be Mr. P.M.W. Massey, Mr. T.T. Chou, and Mr. Ano T. Wong. Mr. Massey is currently a director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and if he takes this position, he will resign as a director, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Family of Three Found Dead from Coal Gas Poisoning in Yongxiang Lane, Zhabei: Pan Jinchang and Sons Dafu and Xiaofu Die Simultaneously; Coal Gas Poisoning Confirmed <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>At 53 Yongxiang Lane, Datong Road, Zhabei, a three-room tenant named Pan Jinchang, who had just moved in three days prior, had two sons named Dafu, about twenty years old, and Xiaofu, eighteen years old this year. The father and sons usually made a living by steaming and selling steamed buns. For many years, they had been setting up their stall near the Xiaocai market in front of the Samsung Teahouse. They had recently moved to Yongxiang Lane. Every night, they would close their stall at two or three in the morning. Unexpectedly, after closing the stall around 2 a.m. the night before, the coal stove used for steaming buns was not extinguished. Dafu and his younger brother slept on a small bed along the window, while Pan Jinchang slept on the floor. At the time, the doors and windows were tightly closed. After falling asleep, the father and sons all died from coal gas poisoning due to their hard work during the day. When dawn broke, the neighbors did not see them getting up and suspected that they were resting at home due to their hard work in recent days. At 11:30 a.m., a friend of Pan's named Liu Bingwen went to Pan's residence and, seeing that Pan had not yet gotten up, shouted loudly, but there was no response, raising suspicions. Liu then summoned police officer Quan Jiugao from Post No. 11 of the 4th District Public Security Bureau to come and help the landlord Sha Guifeng (46 years old, local, electrician) open the windows and doors. To their shock, all three had already died. The police officer immediately reported to police chief Yuan Pilie, who reported to the 4th District and then to Lu Abao, the district chief of the 11th Ward. They reported to the Shanghai Local Court to request an autopsy. Yesterday afternoon at around 3 p.m., prosecutor Xiao Jinying and others were dispatched to the scene. The autopsy confirmed that the deceased Pan Jinchang, son Dafu, and son Xiaofu had indeed died from coal gas poisoning. The coroner's report was filled out, and the district chief was instructed to arrange for the collection of the bodies. Because the deceased had family in their hometown, a telegram was sent to Zhenjiang by the deceased's relatives and friends to summon their family members to Shanghai, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Teacher Convicted of Raping Female Student: Sentenced to Six Years and Two Months in Prison <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Li Xizhi, a teacher at Shangde Elementary School, was accused by Gu Zhangshi, the mother of female student Gu Cuizhen, of seducing and raping Cuizhen and instigating Cuizhen to steal more than forty yuan to pay for hotel expenses. She also stated that Cuizhen was seventeen years old and had not yet reached the age of sixteen, which constituted rape under criminal law. Therefore, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution based on the victim's statement. During the criminal court hearing, Li Xizhi presented evidence to the contrary, including the hotel's revolving ledger, which indicated that Cuizhen had written her age as eighteen and that she had not been sleeping with him; rather, she had opened the hotel room herself, and there was no seduction. However, the trial judge found that the evidence presented by Li Xizhi could not be adopted. Therefore, yesterday's verdict was that Li Xizhi was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for raping a girl under the age of sixteen and four months of imprisonment for instigating theft, to be served concurrently as six years and two months, and deprived of public rights for seven years. However, Li, being dissatisfied with this verdict, naturally appealed, and the court ordered that an appeal was permissible. He was then returned to custody.</p>

<p>Li Shaoyuan, a local girl, seventeen years old, lived at 63 Baiyang General Lane, Shangwen Road, Ximen. Being young, she inevitably loved to play, but her mother did not approve of this. Yesterday, Shaoyuan went out to play again, and her mother severely reprimanded her. As a result, a major conflict broke out between mother and daughter. Unexpectedly, the girl, in a fit of anger, secretly swallowed opium and attempted to commit suicide. It was not until 3 p.m. that it was discovered. She was rushed by car to Renji Hospital for treatment, but unfortunately, she had taken too much poison and died at 4 p.m. The incident was reported to the police, and the body was sent to the autopsy site for examination.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Zhao Weixian's Criminal Self-Complaint: Trial of Wei Tingrong and Son Opens; Mediator Ma Yanqing and Others Had Sincerely Mediated but Failed; Wei Tingrong and Son Arrived in Court Yesterday in Compliance with Summons; After Preliminary Inquiry, Wei Denies Everything; Judge Orders Investigation! <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Weixian, the current Lieutenant Colonel of the Central Air Defense Academy, a native of Henan, was implicated in the kidnapping of his relative and brother-in-law, Wei Tingrong, the former commander of the French Concession Chinese Volunteer Corps and manager of the Sino-French Bank, in 1929 and was arrested. After being declared innocent and released by the Songhu Garrison Command, he felt aggrieved that Wei and his son Yuansheng had instigated false accusations, leading to his wrongful imprisonment for more than a year. He hired lawyers such as Zhang Shizhao, Qin Liankui, and Chen Qun to file a criminal self-complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing Wei Tingrong and Wei Yuansheng of instigating false accusations and requesting that they be investigated according to the law. The court summoned the defendants based on the complaint. The defendants hired Yu Zhongluo, Peng Qi, and Chen Lu as their lawyers to defend them. Because someone came forward to mediate, the date was repeatedly changed. This has been repeatedly recorded in previous reports. Yesterday was another scheduled summons date. The defendant submitted a petition in the morning stating that Ma Yanqing and Zhu Zhuping had not properly mediated and requested a postponement of two weeks. In the afternoon at 2 p.m., the self-complainant Zhao Weixian, accompanied by his commissioned lawyers Ge Zhaoji and Zhou Xiaobo, and the five lawyers Zhang, Qin, and Chen</p>
<h3 id="e160">Arrived at the Court to Report <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>and wait for instructions. The defendants were still represented by the three lawyers Yu, Peng, and Chen. A large number of relatives and friends of both parties who were involved in the case arrived at the court to observe. At the sound of the third bell, Judge Li Changnian, accompanied by Clerk Wang Baoxun, opened the second criminal court for trial. Yao Zhaodi from the Police Affairs Department appeared in court to participate. The judge asked the self-complainant Zhao Weixian, "According to the defendant's petition to the court, did Ma Yanqing and Zhu Zhuping mediate? Zhu is your maternal uncle." After finishing the question, he issued a copy to Zhao for review. Zhao said, "This is not the case." The self-complaint attorney Qin Liankui stated, "In civil cases, mediation and settlement are possible. This case is criminal and cannot be considered a private prosecution. There is no possibility of settlement in principle. Moreover, the self-complainant stated in court last time that he did not want to settle. The defendant requested a change of date under the pretext that someone was mediating. This is</p>
<h3 id="e161">An Intentional Delay <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>etc." Lawyer Ge Zhaoji stated, "This case has been changed repeatedly, not just once. Today, the defendant still has not arrived. I request that a warrant be issued for his arrest." The defendant's lawyer Yu Zhongluo stated, "Ma Yanqing did mediate in this case. Therefore, I submitted a petition this morning requesting a postponement. Ma himself is here and can be summoned. If there is no mediation, the defendant can arrive in court within ten minutes with just a phone call." The court planned to postpone the hearing for two weeks and then conduct the trial again if no settlement was reached. Mediator Ma Yanqing was summoned to the court for questioning. According to Ma, he has been a close friend of both parties for many years. Since the two parties are close relatives, I sincerely want to mediate for them because their statements would be unpleasant if they appeared in court. Therefore, I instructed the defendant to submit a petition</p>
<h3 id="e162">Requesting a Postponement <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>I met Zhao Weixian in Suzhou and said it. Zhao said there was no such meeting. Because the self-complainant strongly opposed the change of date, the self-complainant's lawyer stated that since the defendant could arrive in court within ten minutes, the court might as well adjourn temporarily and wait for the defendant to arrive and begin the trial. The judge then announced a temporary adjournment and instructed the defendant's lawyer to notify the defendant to come to court for trial as soon as possible. After the defendant's lawyer notified the defendant by phone, Wei Tingrong and his son Yuansheng arrived in court within ten minutes. The judge reopened the court and summoned both parties to the case. First, he questioned Wei Tingrong, who stated that he was 44 years old, from Cixi, Ningbo, lived at 999 Xujiahui Road, and was a businessman. Wei Yuansheng stated that he was 25 years old, shared the same籍 and lived with his father. After finishing the questioning, the judge ordered the self-complainant Zhao Weixian to state the reasons for the prosecution. Zhao stated that Wei Tingrong and his son had taken advantage of the grudge to</p>

<p>and frame me. Wei Yuansheng interfered with my freedom and official duties. However, Yuansheng did not act alone; he did so after planning with his father. He asked Wei, "Did you hear what Zhao said?" He replied, "I heard." The judge ordered Wei to defend himself. Wei stated, "I did not falsely accuse him. The police were the original plaintiffs and went to Suzhou to arrest him." He asked, "Have you seen the prisoners you arrested before?" He replied, "I saw them in the police station." He asked, "Did you speak to them?" He replied, "No, the police called me to identify them." At this point, Lawyer Qin Liankui stated, "The previous case files showed that Wei Tingrong had gone to the prison and the Guangci Hospital to see Zhu Jingcheng, Chen Zhongheng, Cai Weicai, etc." He asked Wei, "When the kidnappers initially said that Zhao Weixian was at the scene, and now Zhao is accusing you of false accusations, that means you spoke to Chen Zhongheng at the police station. Chen Zhongheng also said that you went to the prison several times." Wei replied, "At first, I only met them in the writing room of the police station.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Did Not Speak <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The judge said to Wei, "Cai Weicai said that you had been to the prison four times and that you told them to implicate Zhao Weixian as the mastermind of the kidnapping and promised them that if they said so, they would be acquitted." Wei replied, "No, I don't know." The judge said to Wei, "Cai Weicai said the year, month, and day were very clear. If you had not said anything to them, why would they say that?" Wei replied, "I don't know." The judge asked Zhao Weixian, "When were you arrested in Suzhou?" Zhao replied, "Approximately on August 21 of the 20th year of the Republic. The situation was that my team was stationed in Bengbu. I asked for leave to return to Suzhou and then return to Bengbu. As soon as I left my house, I intended to go to the train station when I saw Wei Yuansheng holding a handgun and pointing it at me, saying, 'Please come to Shanghai for a visit.' I asked him what was going on. He said, 'You'll know when you get to Shanghai.' There were three or four people in short clothes standing beside him, and they</p>
<h3 id="e165">Dragged Me Away <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>At first, they made a big circle, and it took three hours to get to the Public Security Bureau. The next day, I came to Shanghai. On the third day, I went to court for a hearing." The judge asked, "Wei Yuansheng, how many people did you go to Suzhou with to arrest Zhao?" He replied, "The police called me to go with them because they didn't recognize him and asked me to go to identify him. After arriving in Suzhou, the detective cooperated with the local detective team to arrest the person. At that time, I was carrying a self-defense handgun, but I did not take it out. I was holding it in my hand. After they arrested the person, I immediately returned to Shanghai. I didn't know what happened after that." Zhao said, "Yuansheng is talking nonsense. He came to Shanghai with me and sat in his car to the police station." The judge asked Wei Tingrong again, "Did you accuse Zhao Weixian of</p>

<p>The judge stated, "According to the confession of the arrested kidnappers Lu Ruowang and Cai Weicai, they went to arrest him." He asked, "Did you submit a petition to the court requesting that Zhao be arrested and severely punished?" He replied, "That was after receiving a phone call from Suzhou saying that the person had been arrested and requesting a supplementary official document. So I entrusted a lawyer to submit a petition. Later, Yuansheng came back, and I asked him why we needed to supplement the official document. Yuansheng said that the police wanted to supplement the official document because the initial official document came from the French Concession court. Since the court had just been established, the official document from the French Concession court was not valid, and a new official document was required. Only then did I realize that I had misunderstood and submitted the petition." The judge questioned Wei again about the instigation of false accusations. Wei replied, "I don't know, there is no such thing. It can be investigated." At this point, the court, because the case still needed to be investigated, ordered a postponement for investigation and then set another date for summons. After the order was issued, the court adjourned.</p>

<p>-Ten People with Suspicious Behavior Captured-</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that the Lushan Maru, belonging to the Nissin Kisen Kaisha, departed for Guangdong at 1:00 p.m. On the 1st. At 6:00 p.m., when leaving the Wusongkou, it was suddenly discovered that pirates disguised as passengers had mixed into the ship. The captain, Tominaga, immediately telegraphed the Nissin Kisen Kaisha by wireless, stating, "There is danger among the passengers, return to Shanghai on the same ship." The company was greatly shocked upon receiving the telegram and immediately reported the telegram's content to the police department of the Consulate General. The police department prepared a small boat at the Hongkou Wharf to wait. At 8:30 p.m., the Lushan Maru entered the port. At 9:00 p.m., the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and twenty members of the police department of the Consulate General, all wearing bulletproof vests, along with the branch manager of the ship's company, Mr. Yamanaka, and supervisor Asai, went to the Pudong Wharf for inspection. Because there were eighty Chinese third-class passengers on board and a large amount of cargo was loaded, the Japanese Consulate General dispatched twenty-five police officers and the Public Security Bureau dispatched fifty police officers, who boarded the Lushan Maru on small boats and inspected the bodies of the eighty Chinese passengers one by one. Until 11:00 p.m., no weapons were found. However, eight people who behaved suspiciously were arrested first. Later, the luggage was thoroughly searched overnight, but no weapons were found until 3:00 a.m. It was also heard that during the inspection of the third-class passengers of the Lushan Maru, two more suspects were found. These people detected that the ship was carrying artificial silk and other goods worth 200,000 taels that day. Because the ship suddenly sailed back, they may have thrown weapons into the sea to destroy evidence, which is also unknown.</p>

<p>Su Heting, 35 years old, from Tianjin, was the manager of Yiheng Bank at 74 Fushou Lane, Tianjin Road, Public Concession in this city. He usually went in and out of various city markets and engaged in gold business. Unfortunately, his luck was bad, and he suffered repeated losses, totaling more than 80,000 yuan. As a result, his funds were tight and he could not make up for it. Although he tried to raise money everywhere, it was of no avail. In desperation, he suddenly checked into room 116 of the Jue Lu Hotel on Tibet Road on the 1st of last [month] and attempted to commit suicide by swallowing opium. Fortunately, the tea servants noticed and quickly reported to the police, who sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. His life is in great danger.</p>

<p>Su Erchai, an investigator in the Political Department of the French Police, recently discovered that someone had privately set up an office of the Eighth Army of the National Government Army in Room 12 of the Central Apartment, Daodeli, Beile Road, in the district, and was issuing appointment letters and defrauding people of money. Therefore, investigator Su pretended to be someone seeking a position and went to the agency. Wang Yifu, also known as Wang Dao, who claimed to be the chief of staff of the Eighth Army Yao Division, met with him and agreed to assign him a position, stipulating 300 yuan, and appointed him as a major adjutant of the Eighth Army of the National Revolutionary Army. He also gave him a letter, promising to pay the money and issue the letter of appointment on April 30th. At that time, investigator Su reported to Western Inspector, and they went to the apartment together to arrest Wang. Subsequently, another man named Wang Yunqing from Anhui was arrested. Wang was impersonating the chief of staff of the commander of the Eighth Army, Mr. Liu. A large number of forged documents such as letters and appointment letters were seized on the spot. Investigator Su also discovered that the two Wangs had used the same method to defraud Li Yaqiang and Chi Yinglei of money for their expenses and had appointed Li and Chi to official positions in the Eighth Army. Li and Chi were summoned to the police station for questioning, and their statements were confirmed. The two Wangs were taken into custody and escorted to the 8th Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday morning. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi of the police department stated the facts of the case, stating that the police were prosecuting under Articles 166 and 363 of the Criminal Code. However, because the investigation was not completed, a certain Yao was still at large. Mr. Liu requested an extension to arrest the accomplices, clarify the case, and request a trial. Judge Wu Fanglian approved the report, questioned the two defendants, and ordered them to be returned to custody. Permission was granted to change the date and arrest Yao and Liu for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zhang Wenbin, a 39-year-old man from Shandong, lived at 13 Rongji Lane, Wangjiatang, Tianyaoqiao, Xujiahui. He was a gatekeeper officer No. 329 in the French Police Department and was assigned to guard the gate of the Sacred Heart School at 6205 Avenue Joffre. At 2:45 p.m. on the 30th, he ran across the road from north to south in front of the school. When he ran to the middle of the road to sign at the west police station, a taxi No. 12602 driven by Wu Chaoshan of the Sichuan Taxi Company came speeding from west to east. He was unable to retreat and was knocked down, suffering head injuries and passing out. The police recorded the license plate number and took the driver and the car to the police station for investigation. The injured man was sent to Guangci Hospital. Because the injury to his brain was too severe and he was bleeding from his ears, the treatment was ineffective. He died at 9 p.m. that night. The hospital notified the police, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor for autopsy. The next day, the Traffic Department of the French Police Department reported to the Second Special District Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren and the forensic doctor came to the scene and confirmed that the deceased had been hit by a car before his death, causing his head to be injured and his brain to be shocked, leading to his death. After questioning the defendant, the driver, he ordered the body to be handed over to the deceased's wife, Zhang Yuan, for burial. The defendant was returned to the Traffic Department for handling according to the law. The deceased left behind a wife and four children, all young, who depended on the deceased for their livelihood. Now that Zhang has died a tragic death, the lives of his family, old and young, will be miserable from now on. It is heard that the deceased's family is demanding 20,000 yuan in compensation for losses.</p>

<p>Yang Songmei from Suzhou used to operate Yang Yongtai Silver Mirror Shop at 4 Liangshan Lane, Rue Pére Robert, French Concession, but has now moved to 1 Yuancheng Lane, Avenue Lafayette. Yang also sells wooden combs from the enemy country. The wooden combs are manufactured by Suzuka Shotenl in Nagasaki, Japan, but are falsely labeled as "Made in Germany" to deceive the people of the country. The trademark used is completely the same as the "Camel" trademark of the American Asian Company. The selling price is much cheaper than the Asian American product, resulting in thriving business and considerable profits. Recently, the Asian American Company learned of this and first went to Wanxiang Sock Factory at 188 Yunnan Road, a reseller, and purchased two defective wooden combs. They immediately reported to the Laoza Police Department, who ordered Chinese detective Zhang Yuanjing, investigator Pang Ruiqing, and Western detective Kladen to rush to Wanxiang and seize three dozen and two more pieces of counterfeit goods. According to Wanxiang's confession, they went to Yang Yongtai Shop and arrested Yang and the street vendor Zhu Zhishao from Suzhou, and seized a total of more than 4,200 enemy wooden combs of various sizes, and took them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the 2nd Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Lawyer Qian Xunjiu of the police department stated the facts of the case and filed a public prosecution under Article 268 of the Criminal Code, stating that more than 20 invoices for sales were also seized from the defendant, all stamped with the return receipts of various merchants. The police are currently investigating, and whether to prosecute Wanxiang Shop is also under consideration.</p>

<p>The Shanghai China Huamei Tobacco Company has successively produced a total of four types of cigarettes: Red, Blue, and Maisigan, which have occupied a superior position among the old brands of cigarettes. The Ginseng brand has only been marketed for two months, but it has already been sold all over the country. The recently released Chinese Standard Cigarettes Guanghua brand is suitable for the tastes of upper-class society in terms of its taste, price, quality, and decoration. The banking industry took the lead in promoting it, and various agencies and organizations followed suit, and sales increased sharply. In order to meet social needs and promote business, the company has established a Huamei Tobacco Company department store on the right side of the New World Company on Nanjing Road. It officially opened the other day. The reporter visited Mr. Jing Yimeng, the general manager of the company. He first accompanied him to visit the department store, where he saw that all the decorations and arrangements were luxurious and elegant, and the light and color were beautiful and harmonious. It is difficult to compare it with the department store decorations of various stores in the city. The reporter asked him</p>

<p>should be postponed for another trial. Then, Detective Zhang submitted a report on the investigation process. The defendant confessed that the wooden combs were purchased from Japan and hired a lawyer to defend him, raising the issue of jurisdiction, saying that the defendant's residence and the place of the crime were all within the French Concession, and the court had no jurisdiction. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the confession and ordered that the case be postponed for another trial. The two defendants were allowed to pay a bail of 1,000 yuan each or provide a guarantor to await trial outside the court.</p>

<p>Yuan Yi Hang is a securities investment firm independently operated by Chinese nationals. It has been detailed in this newspaper before. It is noted that this type of enterprise has been exclusively dominated by foreigners in the past, and the loss of rights and interests cannot be counted. However, foreign operators have failed to fully understand the national conditions, which has led to the inadequate development of this industry, which is also regrettable. How do financial giants in Shanghai view the future of China's cigarette industry? Mr. [blank] said that cigarettes are consumer goods, but the huge consumption volume has actually made it one of China's major industries. The annual consumption of our country's people in this area is approximately 200 million yuan, of which foreign merchants account for six-tenths, and Chinese merchants only four-tenths. However, since Chinese people have changed their mindset and love to smoke domestic cigarettes, the proportion has also changed slightly accordingly. I advocate that it is not difficult to recover this huge leak, and the fundamental solution lies in the efforts of the tobacco companies themselves. For all their products, first, the flavor must be more mellow than imported products; second, the price must be lower than imported products; third, the quality must be guaranteed to never change; and fourth, the decoration must have a creative spirit. If this is the case, domestic cigarettes will surely be enjoyed by Chinese people, and the effect of promotion will be achieved without the need for promotion. Our company adheres to this principle, so its products have achieved unexpected sales today. If all parties make consistent efforts in this regard, then the future of China's cigarette industry can still be optimistic even amidst the turbulent world economic downturn.</p>

<h3 id="e181">German Cultural Groups Hold Concert of Ancient Chinese Poetry <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese-German Association and the East Asian Society, two German groups, are scheduled to hold a concert of ancient Chinese poetry at the Lyceum Theatre on Mailly Road in the French Concession at 9:15 p.m. on May 3rd. It is noted that Chinese and Western music are fundamentally different in principle. Therefore, if ancient Chinese poems are translated into German, set to Western music, and sung, while at the same time the original Chinese text is also accompanied by Chinese instruments and sung, two completely different results can be obtained for comparison. Although the translation strives not to lose the original meaning, Chinese and Western poets cannot have the same concept of emotion, and when it is set to Western music, it feels even more different. This concert of ancient Chinese poetry aims to express this difference. The entire program includes more than ten ancient poems, which are works by famous Chinese writers throughout history, such as Li Bai's "Hearing the Flute in Luoyang on a Cold Night," Tao Yuanming's "When Sunflowers Bloom," Bai Juyi's "Remembering the Willows on the River," and Wang Han's "Liangzhou Ci," which is "Grape Wine and Night-Shining Cups." Finally, there will be an excerpt from "The Story of the Pipa." For example, for the poem "Hearing the Flute in Luoyang on a Cold Night," the translation will be sung with Western music first, and then Mr. Chen Dajun will sing the original text solo, accompanied by the pipa, erhu, and flute. Listeners can see that Chinese music does not have polyphony or harmony, and the instruments play the same tones as the singing, supporting the spirit of the singing. The interludes before and after are where the emotions of the entire song are placed. All the beauty of Chinese music lies in this. When Mr. Chen Dajun sings, he will also appear on stage in ancient costume, so its touching effect will be even more profound. As for the translation, due to the aforementioned differences in the emotions of Chinese and Western poets, the translator's response after being inspired by the original poem has become another realm. If the translator sticks to the original meaning and seeks only to be faithful, he must sacrifice his own poetic meaning. Therefore, the beauty of the translation has already become a purely Western flavor, which is then combined with the harmony of Western music and slightly mixed with Chinese colors, making people unable to help but feel leisurely and fascinated. From this, it can be seen that Chinese and Western music are each an entity, and if they are presented in a pure style, they can better enable people to understand than those who imitate each other and mix them into a chapter. The initiative of the Chinese-German Association and the East Asian Society is not only to encourage the study of ancient Chinese poetry.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Establishment of the Chinese Aeronautical Engineering Society <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Chinese aviation organizations, such as the Aviation Association of Beiping, the Chinese Aviation Comrades Association of Nanjing, the Chinese Aviation Promotion Association of Shanghai, and the current Chinese Aviation Association, are all public propaganda groups. In addition, the Aviation Society of Beiping, the Flying Association, and the Flying Club of Shanghai are similar to club organizations for aviation enthusiasts. There has been a lack of initiators for genuine aeronautical academic organizations. The reason for this is due to the lack of domestic experts and the backwardness of aviation. Recently, technicians working at the Hangzhou Aviation Agency held a meeting to organize the Chinese Aeronautical Engineering Society, and Zhu Lin, Guo Lisan, and Li Lide were appointed as drafters of the constitution. They sent letters to various aviation engineering experts in the country to solicit opinions. Those who agreed to serve as sponsors included senior technicians from the Military Affairs Commission, the Aviation Administration, and its affiliated Central Aviation School and various repair factories and aviation teams, as well as more than 40 aviation engineering experts who studied in Europe and the United States from China Airlines, Eurasia Airlines, the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office, the Hunan Aviation Office, Central University, Tsinghua University, and Zhejiang University. The inaugural meeting was held at the Hangzhou Aviation Administration Office on April 1st, the constitution was approved, and seven directors were elected. Among the directors, Qian Changzuo, Director of the Technical Department of the Aviation Administration, was elected as Chairman, Nie Kaiyi, Deputy Director of the Flight Group of China Airlines, as Vice Chairman, and Wang Chenfu, Factory Director of the Central Aviation School Factory, as Secretary-General. Liu Jingyi, Factory Director of the Capital Aviation Factory of the Aviation Administration, Zhu Lin, Head of the Equipment and Materials Section, Jiang Chaoxi, Professor of Central University, and Guo Lisan, Education Officer of the Central Aviation School, were elected as directors. The main work of the Society is the organization of academic research associations, divided into groups such as air, dynamics, aircraft design, engines, airships and balloons, factory management, aircraft maintenance, aviation materials, aviation terminology, and aviation meteorology. Each member must choose at least one group to participate in the work. At present, most of the groups have been prepared and plan to hold an annual meeting within this year to publicly discuss the research results of each group. The Society has also begun to submit applications to the Ministry of Education and the Military Affairs Commission for registration, and it will make considerable contributions to the development of Chinese aviation in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e183">A Rare Song Dynasty Edition of Buddhist Scriptures <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Song Dynasty Qisha Edition of the Great Buddhist Canon is a rare and exquisite edition from 700 years ago, which is extremely convenient for the four assemblies to recite, study, and research. The first batch of 50 volumes has now been published, with a total of 329 scriptures in 616 volumes. It is a printed version from the Duanping, Jiaxi, and Chunyou periods of the Song Lizong era, and some were added as supplements during the Dade period of the Yuan Dynasty, which is very solemn and exquisite. Resident Zhao Yunchang of the Nantong Baochang, and his son Zongyi, deeply believe in Buddhism. They specially purchased a copy from the Song Edition Sutra Reprinting Society at No. 714 Weihaiwei Road in this city to provide and offer. The entire scripture consists of more than 6,000 volumes and is exquisitely printed from the original version, costing only more than 500 yuan. It is needed by those who lecture on versions, those who study Chinese culture and history, and those who appreciate Buddhist art. For oneself, one has already accomplished this pure wish, and also leave this pure wish to be passed on to future generations. The joy felt in this spirit is incomparable to other kinds of books. Venerable Master Yin Guang has been invited to write a preface to record this event, the original text of which is as follows: Zhao Yunchang of Nantong Baochang Town has inherited family virtues for generations, passed down through farming and reading, only cultivating heavenly nobility, not admiring worldly glory, deeply believing in cause and effect, and earnestly cultivating pure karma. Desiring to have his children and grandchildren forever keep and replace these virtues, he has specially requested the Song Edition Great Buddhist Canon to be offered in the family Buddhist hall, in order to have his children and grandchildren, as well as all members of the clan, be able to receive, uphold, read, and recite it, so as not to be born in vain and die in vain. He prays that Guang will write a preface to show it to future generations. Now, because the Yuan Yin Song Collection Association has ordered Guang to write a preface, I will copy its original text and briefly describe Mr. Zhao's deep love for his children, grandchildren, and clansmen. May those who see and hear this immediately put it into practice according to their own abilities, and do not just act like fools who have arrived at the Treasure Mountain and still return empty-handed. Then not only will they not disappoint the Buddha's transformation and not betray their own spirits, but they can also greatly comfort Mr. Zhao's earnest intention in requesting the scriptures.</p>

<p>Mr. Dong Yixi studied in Japan for many years, specializing in chemistry, and has gained a lot of experience. After returning to China, in view of the fact that the major trading ports in the country are densely populated and fires occur frequently, not only are towering buildings and magnificent architectures instantly reduced to nothing, but lives are also endangered, which is unbearable to witness. Although the disaster may arise suddenly, it is also caused by a lack of adequate preparation beforehand. Recently, the various fire extinguishers sold on the market are bulky in style and expensive in value, making it difficult to achieve the effect of popularization. Therefore, Mr. Dong devoted himself to research and spent several years of effort to invent a lightweight "Safe Fire Extinguisher." Not only is the style exquisite, but the price is also cheap, making it widely available to general users. Its rapid and fierce ability to extinguish fires and the simplicity and convenience of use far surpass imported products. It is the only holy product for fire protection equipment. Keeping a bottle on hand in stores and homes can permanently avoid the danger of fire. It is recently heard that Mr. Dong and his friends have opened the China Safety Chemical Industry Company Wholesale Office on the second floor of 854 Avenue Edward VII, specializing in the aforementioned lightweight safety fire extinguishers. If commercial firms in other cities wish to act as agents, they can contact the wholesale office in person.</p>

The Ping An Factory won. Ships sailing on rivers and seas are most afraid of fires. A single carelessness can always lead to huge disasters, and the loss of cargo and lives on the entire ship is immeasurable. Therefore, recently, the Shanghai Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Communications issued a letter to the Shipping Association to inform various shipping companies that in addition to the original Taiping water hydrants, they must all add Ping An Yiyong brand fire extinguishers.

<p>The houses at Jing'an Villa on Jing'an Temple Road are managed by Hua Ji Company, and the rents are already very high. At the end of last year, the landlord suddenly notified the tenants along the street that the rents would be re-priced from January of this year, and tenants who wish to renew their leases must sign a new lease contract, etc. Upon hearing the news, the tenants all knew that the purpose of this move was nothing more than to increase the rent. However, due to the extreme economic depression in this city, they were unable to bear the rent increase and sent representatives to negotiate, but without any results. The landlord, dissatisfied with the failure to increase the rent, used the excuse of taking back the property for his own use and first filed a lawsuit against the Kaiser Restaurant on the premises, requesting the First Special District Local Court to order them to move out and declare provisional execution. The restaurant was very angry at the landlord's oppression and requested assistance from the Rent Reduction Committee. The Committee entrusted its legal counsel, Lawyer Sun Biwu, to appear in court to argue the case on its behalf. Lawyer Sun collected evidence to prove the landlord's intention was not to take back the house for his own use and vigorously refuted it based on the law. The case was recently ruled on yesterday, and the plaintiff's claim was dismissed.</p>

<p>Mayor's Speech: After the ceremony was completed, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating that he was extremely honored to have representatives and athletes from the Sports Association. Today, he was presenting the flag to the delegation attending the Far Eastern Games, wishing them to bring glory to the country and the nation under the shining light of the national flag and the team flag and return with honor. The honor of the Chinese delegation is the honor of China, which is what the people of the whole country expect from them and wish them to be awarded. He wished them victory.</p>
<p>Representative Accepts: After the Mayor's speech, the flag presentation was held. Zhang Lingjia, the captain of the track and field team, was chosen to accept the national flag, and Tang Baokun, the captain of the basketball team, accepted the team flag. The national flag was the one prepared for the Chinese athletes to participate in the World Games held in the United States the year before last. The team flag had a blue satin background with black velvet characters reading "Chinese Delegation to the 10th Far Eastern Games" in horizontal stripes. In the middle was the "Sports" character in seal script, and below was the inscription "Presented by Wu Tiecheng," also cut from black velvet.</p>
<p>Luncheon Held: The original item of the athletes' representative giving a thank you speech was omitted due to time constraints. Therefore, after the flag presentation, a photograph was taken in front of the auditorium.

All staff and athletes enjoyed themselves until 1:30 PM before dispersing.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting Speaks: Wang Zhengting, Chairman of the National Sports Association, went to Nanjing to meet with President Wang to discuss various issues related to attending the Far Eastern Games. He returned to Shanghai the night before last after completing his official duties and is scheduled to lead the Chinese athletes aboard the McKinley President Steamer of the Da Lai Company this afternoon to attend the Far Eastern Games. Regarding Wang's visit to Nanjing to meet with President Wang, there has been much speculation from the Japanese side, and it has been said that Wang will take on a certain important position. Wang formally denied this statement yesterday.</p>

<p>Hao Gengsheng, a sports supervisor from the Ministry of Education, inspected the sports activities of schools in the provinces of Pingjin, Bian, Xiang, and Lu for more than fifty days, which was quite arduous. He also solicited 3,000 yuan from He Jian, Liu Zhi, and Shen Honglie to fund the Far Eastern Games. The 45,000 yuan in aid from the Ministry of Education was also facilitated by Hao. He arrived in Shanghai early to assist the Sports Association and is departing for the Philippines today to attend the Far Eastern Games.</p>

<p>(Dispatch from the Japanese News Agency Correspondent in Manila on the 30th) The opening date of the Far Eastern Games is approaching within ten days. The various competition venues at the Games site are ready, but the volleyball and basketball courts have not yet been completed and are currently being rushed. The baseball field is quite magnificent and can accommodate 18,000 spectators. The command post of the track and field stadium has been completed, and temporary stands are currently being built around it, with a total of 20,000 seats. Filipino athletes are already practicing in the swimming pool, and the stands have also been 80% completed. At the Dilasai University, where athletes from China, Japan, and the Philippines are staying together, 160 Filipino athletes are staying and are undergoing rigorous training daily under strict supervision. The athletes' dormitories are too narrow to accommodate all the athletes, so some of the Chinese athletes will be housed elsewhere. The Games Preparatory Committee is currently rushing to make mosquito nets for the athletes.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Key Points for Improving Education in Henan Province - Report from the Ministry of Education Supervisor <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent supervisor Zhou Bangdao to inspect education in Henan Province. The results of the inspection have been reported to the Ministry of Education. The key points for improving education in Henan are now explored as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The province's education funding has long been independent, but the management methods should be strictly guarded in the future to avoid fluctuations. (2) Provincial secondary schools are mostly concentrated in larger cities along the Longhai and Pinghan railways, while the western corner of Henan is extremely sparse. This distribution is very uneven. Future establishment of secondary schools should pay attention to adjustment. (3) Normal school districts should be designated immediately to set up various normal schools separately. The number of classes in each school should also be properly regulated according to actual needs to avoid the problem of oversupply or overdemand of teachers in a certain area. (4) The entire province has no vocational schools for women, and remedies should be planned urgently. (5) Subsidies for private secondary schools are granted according to the level of achievement, which is considered fair. However, the amount of funding for each school should be appropriately adjusted based on the number of classes. (6) The number of county-level normal schools in each county is still considerable, but the content is often lacking, and the graduation years vary. Improvements should be made in accordance with the regulations for normal schools. (7) The salaries of principals of provincial secondary schools are measured by the number of classes, which is considered fair. However, academic qualifications and experience should also be used as standards. Also, the salaries of teachers in secondary schools are generally calculated by clock hours, and the full-time system has not been implemented, which is not appropriate and should be immediately formulated by the Ministry of Secondary School Teachers and Staff Salary Scales and Annual Salary Increase Methods for approval. (8) The distribution of county-level elementary schools in each county is uneven, and the amount of elementary schools in towns and villages is too small. School names have not been revised in accordance with elementary school regulations and should be improved separately. (9) Many counties have drafted plans for the implementation of compulsory education, but there are many who hesitate to observe or fail to implement them vigorously. Strict supervision should be immediately imposed to ensure widespread implementation as soon as possible. (10) There are still independent senior elementary schools in each county, which is inappropriate and should be ordered to add junior elementary schools or merge with other local junior elementary schools. (11) Provincial elementary schools that are piloting the two-part system have encountered difficulties due to insufficient preparation in advance. They should be ordered to conduct in-depth research and improvement and appropriately increase funding to facilitate distribution. (12) The Children's Science Museum established by the Kaifeng Experimental Zone Committee has gathered various scientific equipment for use by elementary schools throughout the city. This method is quite economical and appropriate, and should be imitated in other places to solve the problem of relatively difficult teaching equipment. (13) Social education funding, regardless of provincial or county funds, is far from the standards set by the Ministry of Education. A comprehensive plan should be immediately made to allocate a portion of the new funding to social education so that social education can gradually progress with school education, without fear of imbalance. (14) Staff of social education institutions in various counties often lack in-depth research and progressive spirit in social education, resulting in mediocre results and loss of social trust. They should be cultivated and carefully appointed in the future. (15) The Henan Provincial Production Education Implementation Plan, the Henan Provincial Public Education Implementation Plan, and the Henan Health Education Implementation Plan formulated by the Education Department are relevant in content and should be implemented seriously in accordance with them. (16) Shangcheng, Huangchuan, and other counties in the southern Henan Special Zone have been recovered for a long time. They should be quickly subjected to universal special training in accordance with the Education Facilities Plan of the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Special Zone.</p>

<p>Mr. Ye Suizhong, the newly appointed Provincial Committee member and Director of the Education Department of Zhejiang Province, arrived at the department at 8:00 AM on the 1st, accompanied by Li Zhenxia, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Education Department, to take over. He immediately dispatched personnel to take over the seals, files, and equipment, and appointed Xiang Dingrong as secretary and head of the Third Section. Zhao Jiyu, the original acting head of the Third Section, remained in the position of instructor. Secretary He Jinghuang was reassigned to the position of supervisor.

<h3 id="e225">A Record of Incense Drifting by the Imperial Court <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>As long as they did not see anyone sitting down alone in the carriages - including the coal shoveler on the coal pile - and no brakeman moving on the yellow carriage tops without permission, they considered their mission accomplished. However, even such simple tasks were exhausting enough for them because they had to watch constantly and could not sit down.</p>
<p>Here, let me tell you a few more detailed situations.</p>
<p>Meng Fuxiang certainly had one or two important assistants, although he himself did nothing at all. How could these assistants assist? But since he was a more important senior official, he always had several assistants as usual. And these assistants also had assistants with them. So there were many of them. This situation had become an unchangeable custom in the Manchu Qing officialdom for hundreds of years. Whenever a person got an official position where he could make a lot of money, he had to bring all the men in his family with him and let them occupy various important assistant positions. Therefore, if you want these people to actually do something for the country or the people with the money they took, it is as impossible as a rooster laying eggs!</p>
<p>Meng Fuxiang! Now dead for many years! He was the director of the Jingfeng Railway at that time.</p>
<p>The only thing he did was the inflow and outflow of money. Although on the surface he was appointed by the Empress Dowager, if someone caught the chief eunuch Li Lianying and forced him to tell the truth with cruel punishment, we would know that Meng Fuxiang's position was completely bought from Li Lianying by spending a huge amount of money on lobbying.

<h3 id="e226">The Use of Women <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>In the past two or three days, I have either strolled on the road, or wandered in the park, or "prepared tea and snacks" and invited girlfriends to conduct a personal investigation. I have gained a lot of insights into the use of women.</p>
<p>One day, the weather was very good, and there were many photographers in the park. The dead trees and the dull rocks had neither curved beauty nor charming potential. Therefore, those who brought cameras must bring women, either sitting and laughing, lying down and happy, looking up at the clouds, or lowering their heads to peel sesame bananas and the like. They could all be photographed. Their postures were natural, which could not be matched by the dead things like trees and stones. "If there were no women in the world, there would be no invention of the camera." I can believe this if I measure it by reason.</p>
<p>One day, I had no side dishes to drink, so I went to buy a hundred strings of Sichuan pickles and spread them on the table, drinking and humming "Peach Blossom River is a Beauty's Nest." The landlady's daughter came either because she heard the singing or smelled the alcohol. "How much is this pack of pickles?" "One hundred coins!" "I can buy it for only fifty coins." So she gave her five copper coins and bought another pack, which was indeed "better than the previous one." At this point, I suddenly exclaimed, "May all the 'bargains' in the world belong to women."</p>
<p>One day, I put on a bamboo cloth robe and went to XX alma mater to see the art exhibition, but was stopped at the ticket office. "I am an old alumnus!" "I don't recognize you." I asked the principal to come out to recognize me. "Hey! You're quite pretentious." They ignored me. After a moment, three female students came, followed by two men, dressed in Western suits. "Tickets for these two gentlemen." "Make believe." The female student squinted and said. The ticket seller said again, "Public affairs must be handled impartially." "Never mind, never mind." - Three women and two men crowded in, and I could only sigh at the school gate.</p>
<p>Although the above are small matters, aren't they the "usefulness" of "women"?</p>
<p>"The use of women is indeed great!"</p>

<p>— Jinxi</p>
<p>By some chance, I had a trip to Yiwu. You may not know this small county in Zhejiang Province, so I must explain that it is located in the middle of the Hangjiang Road. The historical figures Zong Ze and Luo Binwang, two loyal ministers who planned for the country, were born there.</p>
<p>I took the third express train from Xixing, Hangzhou, at 6:00 PM and arrived in Yiwu at 12:00 AM. It took six hours to sit in the car for a quarter of a day and night. But this time I didn't yawn or fall asleep in the car. The reason is that I was lucky enough to have several travel companions: those naive children and that row of naive and friendly soldiers. They could hum tunes and say silly things with laughter, entertaining not only themselves but also others. They themselves were art.</p>
<p>Art is produced around those who have not been educated and whose minds are too simple to think about the unknowable future with patience. University professors object to writing rickshaw pullers into novels, and aesthetic artists advocate discovering art around women who sway their bodies like snakes. I think there are some mistakes. Friends, this row of soldiers, they don't know that they are dozens of human bombs. They don't want to speculate on the end of their lives and the places where they will be buried. If a writer pierces their minds with a pen and conveys them in detail, making a novel, its value will not be lower than Turgenev's "A Sportsman's Sketches."</p>
<p>Thanks to the soldiers, they were my travel companions, guiding my artistic view to the other side of life.</p>

<p>Madam Jiang, listening from the side, fully understood the situation and replied with a smile, "Yes, Old Master, your behavior is much like that celestial official on the stage." Old Master Zhao shook his head with a smile, "How can that be compared?" Madam Jiang laughed, "Why can't it be compared? Your thoughtfulness towards your daughter-in-law is perhaps even better than that celestial official." As she said this, Guizhi turned her head towards Old Master Zhao with a smile, following the tone of her words. This turn of her head brought her face to face with Ji Zhi. Though her smile was not directed at Ji Zhi, the sight of it stirred his heart nonetheless. He knew that with her father-in-law and mother-in-law present, he must not let his thoughts wander, so he kept his gaze fixed on the stage. However, though his eyes were on the stage, his nose could detect scents from all directions. As he steadied himself, focusing intently on the stage, he was constantly assailed by waves of fragrance. After being struck by the scent for a long time, Ji Zhi looked ahead and saw only men in blue cloth clothing. Behind him, there were two women with oily black hair and heavily powdered faces, so vulgar they were repulsive; they would not be the source of any fragrance. That meant the scent must be coming from Guizhi. Though Guizhi had lightly applied some powder to her face, it did not seem like high-quality makeup, so it shouldn't be emitting any fragrance. Then, where was this fragrance coming from? As Ji Zhi was pondering this question, he glanced sideways at Guizhi. However, it was only a fleeting moment, as he was afraid that his improper behavior might displease the two old people. In reality, the two old people didn't seem to notice anything, but Guizhi was secretly anxious. She thought to herself, "How could I be so careless, sitting so close to him? He keeps glancing around; I must not let the old master see this behavior." (3751)</p>

<p>— A Shock</p>
<p>A Qing used to be my brave warrior, when I shouldered a gun and carried a leather bag, he would always follow me closely.</p>
<p>Every time a bird fell after being struck by my bullet, A Qing would bravely and fiercely extend his iron legs and run forward, quickly bringing the captured prey to me in his mouth. A Qing was indeed my trusted and brave follower. Now A Qing is old, he can no longer be as lively and fierce as before, what he now has is very, very slow steps, old and sparse barks, hair loss, and gluttony, all characteristics of old age.</p>
<p>"Go! You old thing!" Children often hit and kick him when they are unhappy, venting their depression. Alas! Who would have dared to bully him like this two years ago?</p>
<p>One day, A Qing came in frantically, circling around my seat, barking shrilly.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, A Qing!"</p>
<p>He seemed to understand, suddenly turned around, and raised his back. I discovered that he had been injured. A large patch of hair was missing from his back, exposing raw, red flesh. Blood was dripping.</p>
<p>"A Qing! Why didn't you resist?" I asked. He raised his muzzle, wagged his tail pitifully, as if to say:</p>
<p>"I am old!"</p>

<p>Although he was used to drinking Wuyi tea that cost eight yuan a pound, in his current circumstances, even a packet of "family tea" costing ten copper coins plus two rosebuds already seemed quite flavorful.</p>
<p>"Enjoying wealth and enduring hardship, a true man can bend and stretch." These two old sayings were his comforting pill in his declining life. Therefore, even in a situation where suicide would be understandable, he could still live happily.</p>
<p>Coming back today, who knows what new hope he had gained? He held a freshly brewed cup of family tea in his hand, deeply pondering with relish. He stared at the cup as if it held some kind of Western spectacle, his eyes unblinking.</p>
<p>"Ha! Strange! One tea immortal is enough, let alone two." He was excitedly addressing the two tea stems standing upright in the cup. Then he muttered to himself, "One immortal is not surprising, but two tea stems standing together, isn't that something? Zhang Lao San promised to help me, Wang Lao Si promised to reply to me tomorrow. It looks like both things are promising."</p>
<p>He was so happy that he forgot himself and took a sip of tea. "Oh dear! Terrible! Both immortals have fallen!" He stomped his feet anxiously, scolding himself for being damned! Tomorrow, no matter what Lao San or Lao Si, not even a ghost will come to the door.</p>

<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>In my hometown, at the northern foot of Yushan Mountain, there is a Wang Si Restaurant, its fame is known to everyone, from the local gentry to the common laborers. Especially Wang Si's oil chicken, which is as famous as Beijing's Bianyifang roast duck. So, in the bright spring sunshine, Wang Si Restaurant opens for business in season, perhaps in line with the ancient poet's idea of buying wine in Xinghua Village.</p>
<p>I saw a poem by a certain gentleman in the local newspaper, the first two lines of which I have forgotten, but the third and fourth lines I still remember as "Wang Si Restaurant's flavor is good, yellow chicken white wine tender spinach green." His praise for Wang Si Restaurant is very appropriate. Indeed, in the third month of late spring, when the grass grows long in Jiangnan, tasting mountain delicacies and wild vegetables, drinking newly brewed village wine, is so flavorful. Life has few springs, so why not go and have fun, taste the village flavor!</p>
<p>I, a busy laborer, have long been at work when I encounter a spring holiday, thinking of the "yellow chicken white wine tender spinach green," I am still reluctant. I love Yushan, I love Wang Si Restaurant even more. People who love spring outings, when you come to Yushan, don't forget Wang Si Restaurant!</p>

<h3 id="e234">Northwest National Goods Traveling Exhibition <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mang</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Northwest is a region rich in resources, but few know that it is a place where foreign goods sell well. Therefore, anyone who has been to the Northwest says that the poor Northwest people, for the most part, do not know that many daily necessities are produced domestically. It is said that in the Northwest, they still use copper washbasins and wooden washbasins, still smoke British and American cigarettes, use Lion Brand Diamond Toothpaste, still wear American cloth, and wash with Xiangmao soap. In short, it is either completely local products or entirely foreign goods. If you tell them about domestic products, they simply do not believe it, thinking that Chinese goods could never be so advanced. Mr. Guo Weiping has traveled between the Northwest and Shanghai several times, and seeing this situation, he strongly urged the Shanghai national goods manufacturers to hold national goods exhibitions in various parts of the Northwest. Everyone agreed, and recently Mr. Guo, together with Mr. Zhao Bingren, a representative of the Shanghai factories, went to Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xi'an, Lanzhou and other places to negotiate, with very satisfactory results. Recently, Shanghai manufacturers will go to the Northwest together to hold mobile national goods exhibitions, bringing many good products here to the Northwest people, in order to arouse their purchasing psychology and confidence in liking domestic goods. Especially during Mr. Song Ziwen's engagement in the development of the Northwest, many conveniences can be obtained. Going to the Northwest has always been just a slogan, but now it is actually being realized by the national goods industry, which is enough to show the courage of the national goods industry. What the reporter hopes for is:</p>
<p>First, when going to the Northwest, do not just hold exhibitions and think that this is all you can do. You must go deep among the people and conduct practical investigations into their preferences and customs, what should be sold, and what does not meet their needs. Spend more time on interviews and observations. Roughly, in addition to the time used for the exhibition, half the time should be spent on the investigation part.</p>
<p>Second, contact local wholesalers as much as possible, give them various conveniences, reduce their doubts, and gain their sympathy, otherwise, you will create a bad impression and create resistance.</p>
<p>Third, when exhibiting in the interior, it is best to have multifaceted activities, such as banks, schools, government offices, and social organizations. Contact and talk to them, so that they have a thorough understanding, and then they can provide substantial help.</p>
<p>Going to the Northwest is a very interesting thing, and it is also a very labor-intensive and troublesome thing.</p>

<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>This year is the publically designated National Goods Year for Women by various groups. All women in the country, regardless of age, whether wives, grandmothers, young ladies, female students, etc., should stand up to use and promote domestic goods, so that the domestic goods movement, through the advocacy, leadership, promotion, and use of women, can achieve a great effect. On the one hand, it can open up a new path for domestic goods, and at the same time, it can wash away the great shame of the general women, "Women are promoters of foreign goods."</p>
<p>Women themselves should vigorously use domestic goods in this year, but I think that many of the husbands of general women may still be obsessed with foreign goods and are unwilling to truly use domestic goods!</p>
<p>What should a woman who loves her country, loves her people, and loves her husband do when she encounters such a husband? What methods should she use to make her husband wholeheartedly use domestic goods and stop buying foreign goods? The following are some methods that I want to contribute. A housewife who loves to use domestic goods can follow these methods when she encounters a husband who does not love to use domestic goods. Although it cannot be said to be a panacea, it can at least achieve great results:</p>
<p>(1) When the husband buys things home, if they are foreign goods, he can refuse to use them.</p>
<p>(2) When the husband buys things home, you can say: "The thing is good, but unfortunately the money was seized by foreigners!"</p>
<p>(3) When the husband wants to buy something and consults with you, you can persuade him to buy domestic goods, and explain the advantages of using domestic goods.</p>
<p>(4) If the husband still buys foreign goods after you persuade him, you can refuse his requests.</p>
<p>Ladies, "A woman adorns herself for the one who pleases her." A wise housewife who is trusted by her husband, if her husband buys foreign goods, will surely be victorious if she does as the above methods suggest.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Women! Wake Up! <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>Women! When you haven't bought imported goods, you should think about it yourself.</p>
<p>If there are domestic goods for what you want to buy, why don't you buy domestic goods? Are you willing to be a slave to foreigners? Are you willing for your children and grandchildren to be slaves to foreigners? Maybe you think it doesn't matter to buy a few yuan, a few jiao, or even a few fen worth of foreign goods? You are completely wrong. You should read several famous sentences every day: "Foreign economic aggression amounts to more than 120 million yuan every year." Because you have domestic goods but don't buy them, the domestic goods industry will be completely bankrupt. Chinese goods factories are all built on the backs of Chinese people. If Chinese people don't buy them, who will buy them? You should guide your children to take the road of domestic goods. They are all masters of China!</p>
<p>If there are no domestic goods for what you buy, you should use them sparingly and especially should not waste them. When you see others wearing the most fashionable clothes, you should ask yourself in a low voice, "Those are all doing free advertising for foreigners!" If that thing is urgent, like medical supplies, etc., you should choose the cheaper one, but it is not goods for enemies.</p>
<p>Women! Don't sleep anymore. The outflow of domestic economy has shaken the national economy of domestic goods. We have the responsibility of guidance. In this Women's National Goods Year, let's do something!</p>

<p>"Only in a strong wind does one know the strength of the grass, only in troubled times does one recognize the loyal minister." Everyone knows how durable and stain-removing "Solid Root Soap" is! It is hateful that it cannot wash away the treacherous hearts of a large number of merchants who betray their country for the enemy!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that "Solid Root Soap" is durable and stain-removing, and everyone also knows that "Solid Root Soap" is a purely domestic product founded by Mr. Xiang Songmao! However, Mr. Xiang, who painstakingly managed, promoted "solid roots and a strong country," resisted Japanese goods, and was enthusiastic about loving the country, was actually killed by the enemy in the "January 28th" war—the beastly army—at the moment of execution, Mr. Xiang actually said sternly: "I am Chinese, of course I must love China, you and I are of the same race, we should coexist and prosper together, why should we forcibly occupy my country's land? Harm my country's people's lives? ......" Alas! These words are honest and noble! Loyalty reaches the clouds! His indomitable spirit! Can be compared with Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa. What face do treacherous merchants have to see this!</p>
<p>On the day of Mr. Xiang's funeral, the linen clothes were like snow! The cries shook the sky! Whether they knew him or not, everyone wept for him!</p>
<p>All compatriots who bear the responsibility of surviving! You must vigorously use domestic goods! You must eliminate treacherous merchants! You must recognize the ugly faces of the enemies! You must take Mr. Xiang's words as your motto: "In ordinary times, one should have few desires and nourish one's body, in times of great tribulation, one should accept life and entrust fate, in managing a family, one must measure income and expenditure, and in pursuing great righteousness, one should regard a thousand gold as worthless," and everyone should unite! Sever economic relations with Japan, strengthen the ranks of domestic goods! Defend our lifeline! Rise up! Avenge Mr. Xiang! Avenge the country's humiliation!</p>

<h3 id="e238">The Rise in Silver Prices and the Use of Domestic Goods <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenmu</p>
<p>Ever since the news of the rise in silver prices spread from the gold standard countries, in recent days, many people with foresight and wisdom in our country's court and among the people have had many discussions, with differing opinions, but the degree of panic is actually the same. However, there are still many people in our country who are ignorant and not yet awakened from their spring sleep, and who does not have a greedy heart? Because silver prices have indeed risen, foreign exchange must be cheaper. Generally, fashionable ladies, wives, and compradors who sell imported goods will definitely take advantage of this cheap opportunity to engage in large-scale activities. Because the value of foreign goods that used to be one yuan can now be reduced to 70% or 80% below, that is, what used to be four pieces for one yuan can now be purchased for five pieces. Cheaper, cheaper, indeed a lot cheaper. However, the reporter has something to say. If we buy foreign goods, seeking temporary cheapness, and send out our limited silver desperately, to exchange for other people's surplus products, then in the future, the silver will be completely drained and fall into the hands of foreigners. Thus, the rural economy will not be able to circulate, the bank's funds will not be able to flow, the inner treasury will be empty, credit will go bankrupt, the market will be desolate, and all industries will collapse, even to the point where paper money is discounted, and agricultural products fall in price. A one-yuan banknote is actually worth eight jiao, and two yuan of grain may only be worth one and a half yuan. Invisibly, one-third of our assets will be lost. This is one example, but in reality it may be more than this, even below half is unpredictable. If so, the hidden losses can be predicted, and how can it be repaid by the small cheapness we seek today! Now, in order for the United States to promote its surplus inventory and expand its market in our country, it is bound to raise silver prices in order to increase our purchasing power. For the sake of their own interests, how can they stop? And the approval of the Silver Agreement will not have much effect on this. As for our government's restriction on the export of silver, although it is a good law, they can seal all the silver in foreign banks in our country, and transfer it separately. This is equivalent to the property of their country, without the name of shipping silver for export, but with the reality of outflow. It is still ineffective. Don't you see that the amount of silver currently stored in foreign banks in Shanghai has reached more than 270 million yuan, while the total amount of silver in Shanghai is only more than 56 million yuan, that is, only 120-130 million yuan in the whole country. That is, to this day, silver that has entered the hands of foreign merchants has already accounted for half of the total in Shanghai, and is about to reach one-quarter of the total in the country. Afterwards, if the silver price rises again and foreign exchange becomes cheaper, and the people of the country are greedy for small profits and buy foreign goods, letting their silver flow out, I am afraid that the disaster will not be far away. If we do not wake up, how can we save ourselves! Readers, if you are here, then even if the United States passes the increase in silver prices, the government approves the Silver Agreement, and the customs do not prohibit the export of silver, as long as all the people of the country do not buy foreign goods, follow the New Life Movement, and use domestic goods together, then they can only call in vain, and they can do nothing to us. I want my compatriots to pay attention, save the country and save the nation, is it not here!</p>
<h3 id="e239">Promoting Domestic Goods - Building Hankou as a Domestic Free City (Continued) <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yanxiang</p>
<p>Our country's tariffs have long been declared autonomous by the government, but Hankou, the heart of the country's interior, has still not been able to obtain the benefits of autonomous tariffs, and is still suffering from it, leading to its decline. Goods transported by railway are not subject to tariffs, but goods transported by the Yangtze River, domestic goods entering and leaving must be taxed, and foreign goods entering and leaving are not taxed. Water transportation is cheaper than land transportation, so Hankou's domestic goods market cannot compete with foreign goods, because domestic goods must pay high transportation costs or double tariffs. According to the tariff system, Hankou's future will not benefit from the opening of the Yuehan Railway, but will only be a joint transportation point for the Pinghan and Yuehan railways, and only a small number of goods will be exchanged through this joint transportation point.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of our country's domestic goods, for the sake of the Hankou market, and for the sake of the national industry and commerce, Hankou should be built as a domestic free city (the Hankou mentioned here refers to the broad sense of the area under the jurisdiction of the Jianghan Customs). All domestic goods transported from Hankou to any domestic port, Hankou and the arrival port, are exempt from tariffs, and all domestic goods transported from any domestic port to Hankou, the port of origin and Hankou are also exempt from tariffs, and foreign goods that have not been taxed by any of our country's customs, arriving in Hankou, or originating from Hankou, must still be taxed according to regulations. The domestic free city that I call is a free city that is inward-looking. Originally, it is not free to transport domestic goods domestically, so there is absolutely no need to talk about promoting domestic goods. I know the state of our country's central finances, I know the history of the customs system, I know that tax revenue is the foundation of public debt, I know the constraints of diplomatic treaties, but observing the future of our country's domestic goods, the position of industry and commerce in central China, and the recovery of the Hankou market, I believe that Hankou must be built as a domestic free city, so that it can be on par with the free city of Hong Kong, and Chicago as the second largest city. As for the actual steps and methods to solve various difficulties, it is up to the discussion of all sectors. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e240">A Visit to the Oriental New Red Electric Light Company Factory <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Li</p>
<p>New Red lights have indeed become extremely popular in Shanghai in recent years. Whether it is in cinemas, dance halls, or various shops, they have already left their mark, because they are rich in beautiful and attractive colors. In the current metropolitan decorations of the twentieth century, they have indeed occupied a considerable position. Yesterday, the reporter was introduced by my old friend Mr. Xie and had the opportunity to visit the Oriental New Red Electric Light Company factory, which is run by Chinese people. After returning, I hastily recorded what I saw and heard.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xie, the factory was established in the summer of the nineteenth year of the Republic. It was first established on Shishan Road in Zhabei. Later, due to the January 28th War, the entire factory was burned down, resulting in heavy losses. The manager is Mr. Zhang Huikang, who was originally an enthusiastic promoter of domestic goods. He is now also a director of the China National Goods Company and the manager of the Yaguang Electric Wood Company. Therefore, after the Oriental factory was destroyed, he set up a factory on Jing'an Temple Road and continued to operate. Now, a testing department has also been set up in the factory, and Mr. Huang Wenzhi, an engineer, has been hired to preside over everything in the factory. Mr. Huang graduated from Jiaotong University and has rich knowledge and experience. I heard that recently a kind of glass instrument has been successfully tested by Mr. Huang.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>In the near future, the factory will be able to produce its own products and recover the rights and interests. It is also good news in the National Goods Year.</p>
<p>The raw materials used by the factory to manufacture New Red lights, except for New Red gas and rubber wires, are all domestic products, such as glass tubes, transformers, etc. The factory is divided into six departments: tube bending, air extraction, lamp holder making, pattern making, painting, and wiring. There are about 50 workers, and tube bending and air extraction are the most difficult. Therefore, the workers in these two departments are all experienced technicians. Tube benders heat glass tubes about five feet long in a flame to soften them, and then slowly bend them according to the pattern, and blow them with their mouths to make them fat. There are three types of glass tubes: yellow, light yellow, and white. Yellow is used for making green and yellow lights. Light yellow is used for making light green lights. White is used for making blue and red lights. The thickness of the tube is also divided into several types, which are determined by the size of the character. This department's work is especially difficult in summer, because they work next to the fire and cannot open windows for ventilation. The wind will hinder the workers. It is very hard in the hot summer. I heard that the factory has a rule that if the temperature reaches above 94 degrees on the thermometer, they can stop working for one hour at noon, which is also to take care of the workers. Air extraction is more comfortable than tube bending. Just connect the bent character tube to the air extraction machine, extract the air in the tube to make it vacuum, heat the character tube with a powerful transformer, and then add a fixed amount, and light it for several hours on another transformer to make a dazzling New Red light of various colors.</p>
<p>For lamp holder making, pattern making, painting, wiring, etc., dozens of workers wear uniforms supplied by the company, neatly and uniformly, and work diligently. I deeply admire the factory's effective management and the harmony between labor and capital. The future is unlimited. Therefore, I wrote this visit record.</p>

In the most recent ten days, more than 100,000 pieces of Japanese goods were imported,...</p>
<p>(2) I heard that there was a surplus of Japanese rice last year, totaling more than 19.2 million stones.

<h3 id="e243">Necessary Countermeasures (Part 1) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Di</p>
<p>Today, the great disaster of our country, everyone knows it is the impoverishment of the people and the exhaustion of wealth. But where exactly lies the reason for causing this impoverishment of the people and exhaustion of wealth? In a word, it is due to the result of commercial and economic aggression by the great powers. In the past, many people were apprehensive about the great powers' military aggression being enough to destroy the country, because in their minds there was still the tragedy of severed heads and split intestines; but now, they are accustomed to and at ease with the commercial and economic aggression being enough to destroy the country, and they are calmly indifferent. Alas, who knows that this bone-scraping and marrow-sucking chronic pain is even worse than the tragedy of severed heads and split intestines in an instant?</p>
<p>The greatest enemy of our country's national products industry is none other than Japan. And recently, Japan's large-scale dumping of old rice, cotton cloth, matches, toys, and even sports equipment has gained momentum. If we do not devise countermeasures, the disaster of national subjugation is imminent. The purpose of this article is to first explore the reasons for Japan's recent dumping, and then seek countermeasures.</p>
<p>Japan's dumping of goods in our country is nothing new. It has existed since the beginning of the 20th century when that country's industry developed and transformed from an oppressed nation into an imperialist one. However, Japan's recent dumping has its own special reasons, which are described as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Compensation for Export Trade: Japan's exports to China have always been smooth. In 1925, they accounted for about one-third of our country's total trade, and in 1930, they also accounted for one-third. In other words, it has long occupied the top spot. However, since that year, it has shown a decline. After the Eastern Provinces Incident and the Shanghai War, our country strongly resisted Japanese goods, and Japan's trade with China gradually declined. By last year, it had fallen to fourth place, behind England, America, and Australia. For Japan, a country based on industry and commerce, the decline in trade is undoubtedly a fatal injury. It is appropriate that they are now desperately dumping to seek a comeback.</p>
<p>(2) Crisis of Financial Deficit: Finance is an indicator of a country's economic prosperity. Looking at Japan's budget for this year, expenditures reached 2.9 billion yuan, with a deficit of several hundred million yuan. Public debt is the best means to alleviate the deficit. However, Japan's public debt was 700 million yuan last year and increased to 900 million yuan this year. In fact, whether society can bear it is questionable. Is it not the dream of the entire country of Japan to strive to develop foreign trade and shift its economic panic to other countries?</p>
<p>(3) Opposition to Economic Bloc: The division of current economic blocs has become the most obvious thing. Japan's foreign trade, in addition to our country, is strongest with South America and India. Today, India's trade is very unfavorable to Japan, and South America has also been snatched away by Roosevelt's hand. Even Japan, which is as stubborn as it is, cannot help but sigh in vain. Now there is a country that is very close in distance, has a great need for cheap goods, and has no weapons to resist the import of foreign goods. Moreover, this hunting ground has not yet been included in the "bloc" range of other great powers. Is this not the peach blossom spring of Japanese goods?</p>

<h3 id="e244">Financial Market on May 1st: Gold Soars 46.7 Yuan, Peak Reaches 1070.7 Yuan, Hong Kong and Tianjin Rise Even More Fiercely, No Sellers in the Market <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>The gold market experienced a huge change the day before yesterday (May 1st). The morning opening was 1028 yuan, an increase of 4.2 yuan compared to the previous close, which was due to the consistent decline in exchange rates and the silver market, but people's hearts remained stable. After opening, it fell to 7.5 yuan, but after entering the market, short covering suddenly rose. The internal market was tight, the bulls held on tightly, and the shorts rushed to cover. In addition, exchange rates were quoted, continuously shrinking. Guangbang and Dalianbang first bought, and people's hearts were greatly encouraged. Yuanchangyong, Hengxingyuan, Yuqingyong, Dayong, Hengyu, Dafayong, Hengtai, Fuchang, Huixiang, Daxingyong, Dadecheng, Yongtai, etc., repeatedly bought, breaking through the 30, 40, and 50 yuan triple barriers, rising 54.4 yuan. The midday close was 1053.3 yuan. After the market closed, Hengxing represented Western merchants to urgently cover, and the after-market opening increased to 1059 yuan. The market was chaotic, scattered investors reluctantly closed out, Western merchants continued to cover, sellers disappeared from the market, and the price fluctuated extremely violently, once reaching 79.7 yuan, but then retreated to within 66 yuan after supply came in. The banks' appetite was stuffed, and the internal market turned hard. After entering the market, trading was more active, the market was fluctuating, hovering around 70 yuan, falling suddenly, and it was extremely difficult to grasp. The closing was 1070.5 yuan, a sharp increase of 46.7 yuan compared to the previous close. The daily difference was extremely large, and the wind and waves were frightening. The shorts were helpless. There was no news from foreign telegrams, but a large number of positions were closed, and there was no supply on the table. The general shorts were tight on funds and closed out one after another, resulting in a frenzied rise. Hong Kong and Tianjin both rose at the same time, even more so than Shanghai. Therefore, HSBC's quotations were repeatedly revised and reduced, with a total reduction of 625 shillings and a huge drop of 1.5 yuan in US dollars. Due to the higher Tianjin price, Tianjinbang went to the market to cover, selling more than 4,000 taels to Dadecheng and Yingfenghong, an increase of 15 yuan. In the later period, the bidding rose sharply, and Tianjinbang sold more than 1,000 taels to Yingfenghong, an increase of 14 yuan. In the after-market, 1,400 taels were sold to Yingfenghong, an increase of 13.5 yuan. 4,000 to 5,000 taels of domestic goods arrived, an increase of about 13 yuan. The swap was given by Yuanmaoyong to Yingfenghong for 14 contracts, at 1.5 yuan, and the exchange market followed suit. In addition to the Lianbang's investment in the bidding, Chinese merchants lost about 1 million yuan in total. The banks' appetite was not strong. Compared with the 30th, the British exchange was tight by 5625, and the US exchange was tight by 1.3125, which was also a huge amount.</p>
<p>Silver Rises After Violent Surge</p>
<h3 id="e245">Bidding Price Falls Back 13.8 Yuan, Bullish Front Remains Firm, Short Covering Continues, Situation is Extremely Stable <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>After the gold market experienced a violent surge the day before yesterday, unexpectedly the silver market closed up. Yesterday's market (2nd) turned down, but because the general bulls have not wavered, and those who failed in speculation are closing out one after another, the situation in the morning is still firm, and the potential is still strong. In the early morning, the overseas silver market, Britain and the United States both fell severely, but the futures silver price of the Gold and Silver Exchange closed up. Although the exchange rate shrank, it was not much. London spot gold rose 3.5 pence, US wheat shrank 1.5 points, and US cotton fell 18 pounds. The morning price of goods was initially 53-54 yuan, and then fell from 56-57 yuan to 43-44 yuan. The gold industry does not do off-market transactions, and the opening is chaotic. After the opening, a certain speculator from the Hakka gang failed and committed suicide, and the remaining short positions and drafts were covered as soon as they were opened, breaking through the 50 yuan mark. However, the amount was normal, the banks' appetite was strong, and the internal market hardened. HSBC's quotation also recovered, approaching the 40 yuan mark. However, the bullish front remained firm, the banks took the opportunity to buy cheaply, and the market demand exceeded supply. The exchange and gold markets both tended to be firm and gradually improved. The general shorts saw that the situation remained the same, and they were deeply afraid of repeating the mistakes of the previous day. New shorts also rushed to close out, and another short squeeze occurred, breaking through the 60 yuan mark. Finally, the demand and supply were fluctuating, and the market was chaotic again, rising and falling suddenly, and it was difficult to grasp. The situation turned mediocre, with many bystanders, and both buyers and sellers were unwilling to take action. The midday close fell slightly. It was found that the fluctuations in the morning were still chaotic. After the violent surge the day before yesterday, it should have fallen back, but the general bulls' entry prices were low, so their will was still firm, and it was not yet time to exit. Otherwise, the gold price would have been挫. The red gold price is estimated at 1060 yuan, and the swap premium is about 1.5 yuan. The morning market is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1045 yuan, a decrease of 25.5 yuan compared to the previous close. The goods opened at 9.5 yuan, and the exchange market opened with near-term selling prices, with British exchange at 1 shilling 2 pence 9375 and US exchange at 30 yuan 9375, and then fell to 2 yuan. The speculator who failed and committed suicide covered his short positions, as did the exchange market. Dadecheng, Dalianbang, Zhifengyong, and Yicheng in the market rushed to cover and rise, and Hengyu and Yangfengyong also paid, and in an instant, it rose to 53 yuan. Hengxing, Dafayong, and Fuchang sold out, falling to 49 yuan, but Dalianbang and Zhifengyong still entered, and it rose again to 51.2 yuan. Tianfeng and Qianchangxiang sold contracts, falling within 50 yuan. At this time, Dadecheng, Yingfenghong, and Dingkang bought from time to time, and there was still a turnaround. After entering the market, the internal market hardened, and the banks continued to stuff. Shanghai stuffed August US dollars 375, and it was learned that HSBC's quotation, British rose 375, and US rose 625. Hengxing, Fuchang, Fuxingyong, Senchangyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yidayong, Fuyu, and Yuanshengyong sold again, falling to 44 yuan. Yuanmaoyong and Dadecheng entered contracts, and although it rose to 7 yuan, it eventually fell to 1 yuan because the exchange market tended to be firm. Fuchang, Zhifengyong, Yingfenghong, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong Shenkang, Yidayong, etc., jointly supplied contracts. Shanghai stuffed August US dollars by half a yuan. Mitsui ate June US dollars by 25 and stabilized, but struggled. Goods, Zhaofengchang, Yingfenghong, and Dalianbang still took in stomach, returning to 5.5 yuan. Ruikang and Fuchang sold out, falling to 3 yuan. After entering the market, Guangbang raised prices, and Fuxingyong, Hengtai, Yuqingyong, Yufengyong, Fuan, and Shengda paid contracts, rising to 50 yuan. Daiying ate August US dollars by 4375. Fuchang supplied from time to time and often fell back. Wabie ate July Zhangdian by 1875, the exchange market turned tight, and hedging activities took place. Hengtai, Tianfeng, and Dadecheng went to the market to buy, and rose back to 55 yuan. Shanghai Wabie ate August US dollars by 25. Shenkang and Fuchang were still selling, and once fell to 2 yuan. However, people's hearts were stable, the table was dry, and as soon as there was a buyer, there was a lack of supply. Hengxing, Tongxinyong, Shengda, Fuchang, Ruikang, Dadecheng, Tianfeng, and Zhifengyong bought one after another. Seikin納 July 32 yuan, Mitsui扒 September US dollars by 1875, and rose to 61 yuan. Hengyu and Fuchang took the opportunity to sell high, falling to 54.5 yuan. Bingxing, Hengxing, and Dalianbang still entered, and broke through the 70 yuan mark again. After entering the market, Fuchang launched a lot, and people's hearts were not at peace. Trading was mediocre, and market prices rose and fell suddenly, hovering uncertainly. Finally, Zhaofengchang, Fuchang, and Yuanmaoyong came to sell, and once fell to 55.1 yuan. The midday close was still up at 1056.7 yuan, and the goods auctioned at 6.3 yuan. After the market closed, Fuchang gave up contracts, but Tianfeng's buying appetite was still strong, struggling at 5 yuan. When Yuanshengyong sold vigorously, it fell within 4 yuan. It was found that the highest half-day was 1061 yuan and the lowest was 1041 yuan, with a difference of 20 yuan. As a result, it fell back 13.8 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was HSBC's US exchange quotation rising 625, totaling 31 yuan 625, which is equivalent to a bidding price of 1094 yuan. According to the closing price, it is about 37 yuan, which is 7 yuan less than the previous close. The account for this month is 1059 yuan, and for June it is 1057 yuan. The morning supplementary water is 1059 yuan, and the red gold price is 1060 yuan. The scorching red market is flat, and Hakka gangs continue to enter. Dadecheng and Yingfenghong in the market sold more than 2,000 taels to the Tianjin gang, with an increase of 15 yuan and 14 yuan. First high and then low, because the bidding price was first low and then high. Domestic goods are still pouring in, an increase of about 12.5 yuan, which is distributed among the peers, about 1,000 taels.

<p>In the past few days, it was the end of the fourth big comparison period, with a large amount of inflow and outflow, and the situation was prosperous, but the actual situation was very tragic. Various industries could not get the real benefits of adjustment and abundance, and the tax rates felt exhausted and unbearable, resulting in a sluggish market atmosphere in various industries, and there was no possibility of activity. The situation in the past two days has been light beyond constant. (The previous day was Labour Day and this newspaper was closed, while the silver and money industry was operating as usual. All the market conditions on the previous day are detailed in another manuscript.) Yesterday, the foreign transfer market in the market was 7 cents in the morning and noon. The addition of water at the beginning and end was soft, so there was initially 5 cents plus water, and finally only 2 or 3 cents. In the transfer ticket transaction, more than 4.2 million was transferred in the morning market, more than 300,000 in new transactions, more than 300,000 in noon transactions, more than 400,000 in small general transactions. Foreign deposit transactions took redemption more than 900,000, and new deposit was made more than 1.3 million. More than 800,000 banknotes were recovered and more than 900,000 were issued.

Money shops received and delivered more than 41 million in foreign public orders, more than 8.34 million in foreign drawing payments, more than 500,000 in various remittance payments, and more than 1 million in cash. In addition, the total number of exchanges in the local bill exchange on May 2 was 9,018,495 yuan and 3.9 cents in silver dollars, including 5,616,667 yuan and 9.9 cents in silver dollars, and 3,400,000 and another 1,827 yuan and 4 cents in remittance silver dollars.</p>
<p>The financial market conditions of May 1 are supplemented below. According to the market situation on this day, although the fourth bottom has expired, there are still lingering effects, so the situation in all aspects is quite good. The foreign transfer market price is also 1 cent higher than the previous day. Both the morning and noon markets are 7 cents, and Liu Tou's addition of water also has a market of 3 or 4 cents. In the transfer ticket transaction, more than 4.6 million in morning transfer and new transactions, more than 300,000 in noon, more than 700,000 in small general meetings. Bank withdrawals and deliveries: foreign banks withdrew and delivered more than 2.9 million in ticket payments, more than 5.3 million in various foreign exchange deposit miscellaneous payments, more than 700,000 in telegraphic transfer payments, and 500,000 in out-of-warehouse. Chinese banks withdrew and delivered more than 2.9 million in ticket payments, more than 5.6 million in various foreign exchange tax deposit miscellaneous payments, more than 400,000 in telegraphic transfer payments, more than 600,000 in customs tax payments, and 400,000 in out-of-warehouse.

<h3 id="e248">The Market Conditions of Subsidiary Coins in the Past Two Days: Only Jiangnan Small Coins Increased by 5 Yuan <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Because this newspaper was published the day before yesterday and could not be published, it is supplemented today. It was found that the Jiangnan small and south small coins on May 1 the day before yesterday were both 847 yuan in the morning and noon markets, and the transaction was 7,000 jiao in the morning market and 6,500 jiao in the noon market. The Guangdong small coins were 742 yuan and 5 jiao in the morning market and 744 yuan in the noon market. The transaction was 50,000 jiao in the morning market and 60,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were 330,500 wen. Yesterday (2nd), the Jiangnan small coins were 842 yuan in the morning market and increased by 5 yuan in the noon market, the same as the day before yesterday at 847 yuan. The transaction was 6,500 jiao in the morning market and 9,000 jiao in the noon market. The Guangdong small coins were 744 yuan and 2 jiao in the morning market and 744 yuan and 3 jiao in the noon market. The transaction was 90,000 jiao in the morning market and 45,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were still 330,500 wen, and the transaction was 34,702,500 wen, with a value of 1500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Severely Diminished Trading of Securities and Public Bonds; All Parties Watching and Waiting; Prices Generally Rebounding <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 2nd), the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange and the market in general continued to strengthen. The intense international activity had ceased, and Japan's so-called new policy toward China was merely speculative. In the near future, there shouldn't be any practical measures implemented. Any negotiations would have to wait until after Arima Akira's visit to China. The market sentiment was predominantly one of watching and waiting, greatly diminishing trading volume. Sellers and bulls were mostly absent. Although there were many potential buyers, they weren't willing to drive up prices, so their demand wasn't met. Large-scale selling that occurred on the 5th the day before had stopped yesterday. Therefore, although trading wasn't particularly active, the market was tight, with each trade experiencing small increases. Throughout the day, prices generally rose in a straight line. Although there weren't large transactions in the opening trades in the morning, demand clearly exceeded supply, and various items saw slight increases, with whole numbers rising by a maximum of four jiao. The market remained strong in the second session, with all but the whole number 696 rebounding by one jiao, and the rest continuing to improve by one or two jiao. Trading in the afternoon was more chaotic, but increases still outnumbered decreases. The market was particularly stable at the close, generally improving by another one or two jiao. The environment wasn't expected to change temporarily, making it difficult for market prices to drop sharply. In total, the market prices generally increased by one or two jiao to five or six jiao, with only the current month's prices for the 18th and 19th customs bonds slightly decreasing by five fen or one jiao. The total transaction volume was 11,150,060 yuan, including 6,000 yuan in cash and 11,150,000 yuan in futures. The details of the price changes are listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e250">New York Stock Market Fell More Than It Rose <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>A report from the Sin Fung Foreign Firm stated that yesterday (the 1st), the stock market was mixed, slightly lower, as the wave of inflation gradually subsided. The market needed to align with proper monetary policy. The decline in major commodities indicated that the securities situation was still good. Investors were actively purchasing preferred stocks. Wheat and cotton prices eased, and the US dollar exchange rate strengthened. Small exchanges saw scattered selling. The market and its appetite were unhealthy, leading to declines of several jiao to two yuan. Bond prices were mixed, with US government bonds remaining strong. Speculative stocks were slightly lower due to external influences. Another report from a broker stated that (securities) had good resistance and were developing a trend toward higher prices, possibly continuing to strengthen. (Wheat) General forecasts predicted rain in the production areas, so bulls were actively closing positions. However, it was difficult to believe that the market would collapse as a result, creating a favorable situation for buyers. (Cotton) The government's monetary policy would follow proper channels. As the market rebounded, bulls who had purchased based on inflation tended to sell. However, resistance gradually increased, and the market decline might limit the selling of spot goods in the South, creating the possibility of a market rebound. However, concrete progress still depended on increased demand for physical goods. (Rubber) The market was brisk, with manufacturers buying, and demand exceeding supply, likely continuing to rise. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.34 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e251">Cotton Yarn; North China Rough Yarn Sales are Remarkably Brisk <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 2nd), the yarn market fell in the morning but rose in the afternoon. The general sentiment was that the environment was unfavorable, and the idea of short selling was strong. Market pressure remained heavy. However, sales of rough yarn in North China were brisk. According to surveys, factories had sold a considerable amount of their current yarn, reducing inventory. Several factories had already sold out their June and July futures contracts for 10-count rough yarn. Therefore, the market may be somewhat stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Marked Yarn Resisted the Decline and Rebounded <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>In the opening session of the marked yarn market, sellers exerted pressure, causing all months to fall by three, five, or six jiao. In the afternoon, news of strong yarn sales in the North Road led to short covering, and all months rebounded by one, two, four, or five jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 16,200 bales, compared to 15,700 bales the previous day. Sales included 1,150 bales from Yuan Da, 900 bales from Tong Fu, 650 bales from Da Feng, 550 bales from Heng Yi, 850 bales from Geng Feng, 850 bales from Chang Yu, 600 bales from Yang Cheng, and 550 bales from Chang Feng. Purchases included 700 bales from Sen Kang, 650 bales from Chun Ji, 550 bales from Ming De, 1,100 bales from Yuan De, 600 bales from Chang Feng, 600 bales from Tong He, 600 bales from Chang Yu, and 350 bales from Rui Da.

<p>Yesterday (the 2nd), the cotton market initially fell but then rose. Sellers aggressively sold, citing the drop in US cotton spot prices by one jiao and one fen. However, the sharp rise in gold prices and the corresponding contraction in exchange rates prevented calculation prices from falling, so bulls remained unshaken. Furthermore, Japanese and Ningbo merchants bought on dips, causing the market to re-enter a spinning pattern.</p>

<p>In the opening session of the marked cotton market, although American and Indian cotton prices fell, exchange rates continued to contract. Despite pressure from sellers, bulls remained firm, with all months falling by five fen to one jiao. In the afternoon, short covering led to a rebound of five fen to one jiao in all months. The total transaction volume yesterday was 52,400 dan. The previous day's transaction volume was 76,800 dan. Sales yesterday included 3,900 dan from Ji Feng, 2,400 dan from Da Fu, 5,900 dan from Da Feng, 5,900 dan from Yuan Da, 1,200 dan from Chang Yu, and 2,000 dan from De Ji.

<h3 id="e258">US Cotton Plummets by Forty Pounds in Two Days <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>(The day before yesterday, April 30th) US cotton fell due to a lack of buyers, poor spot prices, and bull liquidation. As a result, spot prices fell by two pounds, and futures fell by 21 to 27 pounds. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by one point, and futures fell by one to six points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to bull liquidation and selling by a few European exporters. As a result, Pingal fell by three to seven and a half jiao, and White Luo fell by three lupee and two and a half jiao. The US cotton market continued to decline the following day, initially falling due to mass selling, then rebounding slightly with reactive buying, and finally falling again due to bull liquidation. As a result, spot prices fell by 20 pounds, and futures fell by 13 to 18 pounds. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by eleven points, and futures fell by twelve or thirteen points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by sixteen points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to poor US cotton prices, bull liquidation, and a lack of buyers. As a result, Pingal fell by one rupee and seven and a half jiao, Aomula fell by three lupee, and White Luo Creek fell by four lupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The Chinese Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange, on April 27th, appraised the cotton yarn grade list. All substitute standard products remained unchanged. However, three products from the Chongming Fu An Yarn Factory, 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count yarn, were added to the grades. The 10-count Xing Shi brand from the Xiaoshan Tong Hui Public Factory was removed from the grades. Other than that, the grades were the same as in September, which are omitted for brevity. The newly added marked yarn, Golden Pagoda brand, is recorded below: 20-count Golden Pagoda brand is reduced by 5 yuan, 16-count Golden Pagoda brand is reduced by 19 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e261">Rumors Abound in the Grain Market; Very Little Marked Flour Trading <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 2nd), the flour market, after opening in the morning, saw varying levels of price fluctuations for all months. Canadian flour fell by about two jiao, so market sentiment softened after prices. This month's market softened further due to bull redemptions, falling to a minimum of 1.97775 yuan. Distant months initially fell slightly, but rebounded slightly as there weren't many sellers. When the afternoon session opened, the market was still flat. However, rumors abounded in the market, claiming that the exchange would undergo changes due to some kind of situation. Therefore, market sentiment improved slightly, but trading was very limited. A small number of factories showed signs of resistance, so the decline was minimal. The notion of the exchange entering the market is a major matter, and how easy would it be to discuss? As a result, this month's price improved by 0.0025 yuan, June's price improved by 0.01 yuan, July's price improved by 0.005 yuan, August and September's prices improved by 0.01 yuan, and there was no comparison for October.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Limited Activity in Wheat Futures <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market exhibited a quiet and spinning pattern after opening in the morning. Foreign wheat quotes were around 6 or 7 jiao lower in Chicago, and around 2 jiao lower in Canada. Given this situation, the market should have continued to decline. However, there were relatively few customers selling, as although the weather was good, there was still no firm certainty about the new wheat harvest, so everyone waited and watched before taking action. Therefore, market sentiment was slightly tense. In the afternoon, all sessions were slightly improved due to the slight improvement in the flour market, but trading was sluggish and meaningless. As a result, July's price improved by 0.01 yuan, and August's price improved by 0.02 yuan. Since factories were importing foreign wheat, there was no appetite for spot wheat, so there was no trading.</p>

<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>Because Western modern culture has a natural and lively view of life, and has undergone the liberation of the 19th-century Romantic movement, Western modern culture is more tolerant and more humane. I believe this is a sign of the healthy spirit of Western nations. Although new culture has been promoted in China, it has not been refined by decades of Romanticism, so people's hearts are still depressed, and people's minds are still dry. As soon as there is danger, everyone bursts into a flurry of firecrackers, which disappears like a flash in the pan after five minutes, because people's hearts are fundamentally unhealthy, and the balance between joy and sorrow is lost. Crying out in pain may seem more sincere and patriotic than smiling or being occasionally comfortable, but unfortunately, after crying out until one's throat is dry, the breath cannot be sustained, and silence follows crying, like a child falling asleep after crying. Although occasionally groaning once or twice in the silence, it is the moaning of a sick poplar, a sour, corrupt, and decadent sound. In today's literature, it seems that there are no loud shouts, only sneaking in the dark to release a few cold arrows. But people's psychology is always self-righteous, so there is a habit of sucking... One feels weak oneself, and hates that others are healthy. One's own actions are evil, and one is jealous of others' liveliness. One drinks water oneself, and one is jealous of others drinking tea. One groans oneself, and one hates others' laughter. It is always due to a lack of generosity in the heart. For two thousand years, the "fangjinqi" spirit has still pressed down on the 20th-century vernacular writers, making it impossible for them to breathe. As a result, only a buzzing sound can be heard in literature.</p>
<p>The so-called natural and lively Western view of life can be illustrated with new examples. For example, playing is natural. In the past, Confucian academies forbade children from playing. Now, educational concepts have been liberated and are closer to nature. As a result, not only is playing not forbidden, but kindergartens, primary schools, and middle schools use play to nurture children's virtues. Western couples are affectionate and travel hand-in-hand, simply acknowledging that the pleasures of men and women are something that humans should have and do not need to disguise. Therefore, they generously walk hand-in-hand on the street without feeling strange. From the Chinese perspective, one can only secretly envy the "foreign devils" for knowing how to enjoy sensual pleasures. But once Chinese people also become liberated in terms of male-female relations, it is considered unacceptable, and said to be harmful to social customs. Seeing Western men and women bathing naked in the sea and playing in the water, one may also envy them, but seeing Chinese men and women bathing naked in the sea, one must immediately scold them for corrupting social morals. Western women's clothing may be very seductive, but no one in modern Western criticism has said that they are harmful to public morals, because they already have some tolerance from the Romantic movement. However, when Chinese people see Western women in seductive and glamorous clothing, they may admire them, but when they see Chinese women in the same kind of clothing, they will scold them for being "modern." Western stage dances, such as the grass skirt dance, are a hundred times more perverse than anything in China, but it has never been heard that Western thinkers have criticized them. In fact, Westerners have not forgotten to love their country as a result of watching the grass skirt dance. Chinese people cannot tolerate the grass skirt dance, putting on a moralistic face and scolding it as a sign that people's hearts are greatly changed and the world is in great chaos. However, Chinese people have not become morally superior or their country richer and stronger as a result of their strict lives. The whole country is filled with a kind of gloomy, moldy, hypocritical, and pedantic atmosphere. Therefore, these "fangjinqi" critics, even while groaning under oppression themselves, scolding "cultural unification," and complaining about "news censorship," will oppress others as soon as they become news censors themselves. I saw my daughter watching two bedbugs arguing on the bed board. One scolded the other, "You are a bedbug!" And the other scolded back, "You are a bedbug!" I hid to the side and laughed heartily.</p>
<p>Because their hearts are fundamentally unhealthy and their lives lack the courage to move forward, "fangjinqi" critics are only good at destruction. When faced with advocating the natural and lively Western view of life, they can only denigrate and cannot build. They criticize the Analects, saying "China has no humor." If China had humor long ago, why would there be a need to promote it by publishing the Analects? Shouting "China has no humor" from the sidelines will not cause the roots of humor to gradually flourish. Moreover, even if the Analects does not have successful works of humor, it has at least changed the attitude of the Chinese people towards humor. Unless one is a novice who is still paying attention to the "Great Way" of the universe and saving the country, everyone has a deeper understanding of humor. Only a few people who have a superficial and incomplete understanding cannot accept the Western culture's attitude towards humor. This kind of passive and destructive criticism, while claiming to promote Western culture, actually hinders Western culture, and will not itself achieve solid results. When *Ren Jian Shi* ("This Human World") was published, it stirred up the "hang yu hang yu" faction's "fangjinqi." They flailed their arms and legs, blowing wildly, but did not move *Ren Jian Shi* in the slightest. There was not even a decent critique of the content and editing of *Ren Jian Shi* that I could humbly accept. For example, I myself thought that there were too many articles about flowers, trees, spring light, and travel in the first issue, which was unsatisfactory, but no one pointed this out. In short, there was not a single piece of writing that I thought was worthy of criticizing *Ren Jian Shi*. Only the attack on Zhou Zuoren's poetry was a critique of content, but it was laughably shallow, only attacking a private individual. What is the error of *Ren Jian Shi*? I know... Using Song typeface is too archaic. In the eyes of a "fangjinqi" critic, this is an unforgivable crime.</p>
<p>Editor's note: If the debate about humor, etc., continues to develop, it is feared that it will be far from "humor." It is proposed to end this here for the best.</p>
<h3 id="e268">For Self and For Others <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Fa</p>
<p>When a novelist writes a novel and an artist creates art, their starting point is centered on themselves, embracing an attitude of "I am the only one worthy of respect in heaven and on earth." They truly feel that even if the heavens collapse and the earth cracks, it will not move my hammer or paintbrush. Moreover, the world will come to an end after I have fully expressed my abilities. Only then can there be great creation.</p>
<p>However, when working for society, promoting an idea, or guiding young people, the approach is completely different. This is almost entirely for others! Although one cannot be without oneself when working for others, one must always think of others, society, and humanity. It is also worthwhile to consider the current situation, take into account the future, and consider the methods of expression.</p>
<p>It seems that many great figures today have not noticed this point. Perhaps in the midst of chaos, they have not realized their own influence and power. After a word is spoken, the effect is minimal, like a wheel axle, while the resulting movement is large, like the wheel. As a certain gentleman once said, turning in the center and following the perimeter, one is forever busy, wasting effort and achieving nothing. That analogy is indeed accurate.</p>
<p>Much of the energy of some young people has been wasted in vain, following the adults and teachers in shouting slogans and running around. As a result, the leaders often end up in a situation where the present self is fighting with yesterday's self, at most lightly admitting mistakes, while the common people suffer, bleeding and dying. The mistake is that they used to purely express themselves based on emotion. Now they are trying hard to make up for it, but how can they make up for it? And today's self may fight with tomorrow's self again, so the situation is even more dangerous!</p>
<p>The rapid reversals and repetitions of Japan's Westernization and its subsequent return to tradition, and the revolution followed by the worship of Buddha, have resulted in countless sacrifices. It is not until many leaders gradually reach old age, their knowledge richer than it is now, and their temperament more peaceful, that they recall what they did in the past and secretly exclaim, "Shame! Shame!"</p>
<p>There may be many emerging leaders. Whatever they are advocating, it is worthwhile to consider the current state of this era and the future impact. The beginning is simple, but the end is great. There is ruthless history and unforeseen facts behind it, which must be carefully considered!</p>
<h3 id="e269">Essays and Novels <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Essays and novels are two different literary genres (Genre Litteraire). Of course, there exist neutral things between the two. However, the distinction between the two is clearly visible.</p>
<p>These two different literary genres are mutually related. "The river water does not interfere with well water" is very rare in the world. However, their social basis at the time of origin (Origin) is different. And, that refers to the origin of the genre. It is not to say that, thereafter, those who write prose essays are certainly entirely from the scholar-official class, while those who write novels are certainly entirely from the citizen class. However, in prose essays, reflecting the leisurely thoughts of the idle, is the majority. Why can so many prose essays be produced among British writers who are gentlemen (Gentlemen)? The realists from the citizen class, like Zola, Flaubert, and others, don't write many prose essays, do they? This is something we cannot but study from the relationship between genre and social life.</p>
<p>I believe that these two different genres should independently seek their own development prospects. If, as Mr. Xu Weiyong said, "writers with fulfilling lives" "use the strength to wrestle lions to write prose essays," needless to say, prose essays will have a great future. However, are such writers only a very small minority? Are there some prose essay writers who, because other paths are blocked, go to prose essays to find an escape route? The tendency of "novelization of essays" contains elements of retreat. The pursuit of a fulfilling life is the fundamental method to resolve this tendency of retreat, needless to say. However,</p>
<h3 id="e270">On Writing (II) <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan said: "All argumentation should be based on reputable authorities, not on sophistry. To rely on arrogance when words are inadequate, to wander in rage and pique, trampling on crops and vegetables, ultimately leading to self-contradiction in several chapters, is something the ancients did not do." "A type of work, divided, becomes several chapters; combined, it is only one chapter, with an inherent and well-ordered system. Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian is divided into five categories: Annals, Hereditary Houses, Biographies, Treatises, and Tables. The Annals and Tables serve as the warp, and the Hereditary Houses and Biographies serve as the weft. Warp and weft complement each other, forming a seamless great work. Zhuangzi's "Wandering Freely," "Discussion on Equalizing All Things," and "Nourishing the Lord of Life" three chapters, when viewed together, are also just one great work. Great works are difficult to organize. Throughout history, those worthy of being called "works" are, apart from the philosophers of the pre-Qin period, only Wang Chong's Discourses Weighed in the Balance, Liu Xie's The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons, Liu Zhiji's General Principles of Historiography, and Zhang Xuecheng's General Principles of Literature and History, just so few. The modern world of writing appears exceptionally barren, which also shows the general weakness of organizational ability!"</p>
<p>Gu Tinglin himself said that in his life of reading, whatever he gained, he would record it; if there were disagreements, he would revise it from time to time; if the ancients had it before him, then he would delete it. "If the ancients had it before me, then I would delete it." This means that without unique insights, one cannot form one's own school of thought, and there is no need for writing. In recent times, there have been several dozen types of histories of Chinese literature, varied and diverse, published. If we want to meticulously write a history of literature, we should see how others have organized their histories of literature. If our own opinions are completely the same as theirs, then we should not write. If most are the same, but a small part is different, it is enough to write "Notes on Differences in a Certain History of Literature." Mr. Lu Xun, in his lecture in Guangzhou, "The Demeanor of the Wei and Jin Dynasties and the Relationship between Articles, Medicine, and Wine," at the beginning, cited Liu Shipei's History of Medieval Literature, saying, "If Mr. Liu's book is already detailed, I will be brief"; conversely, "what Mr. Liu is brief on, I will be more detailed." This method of being detailed where the other is brief and mutually elucidating can be said to be the most enlightened approach. If this method is followed, most of those monotonous histories of literature on the market can be discarded.</p>
<p>In the past, people often wrote annotations for ancient books, and annotations are also works. Liu Xiaobiao annotated A New Account of Tales of the World, complementing the original text by Liu Yiqing. Pei Songzhi annotated Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms, "What Shou did not record, matters that should be preserved, he would take in full to fill the gaps. Or, if the same event was described in different terms, or if the events originated from different sources and doubts could not be resolved, he would copy and include them to provide different accounts." With the talent of Liu Xiaobiao and Pei Songzhi, could they not have written their own books? Yet they only made themselves known through annotations. Writing is for the public good, there is no need to set up a separate banner to elevate oneself. For example, Zheng Kangcheng's compilation and annotation of the Classics broke the divide between the Old and New Text schools. Zhu Xi's annotation of the Four Books expounded many genuine insights of Neo-Confucianism. Annotations have the same value as original works.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>Recently, I read Fang Dongshu's Shulin Yang Kui, (a person from Tongcheng, Qing Dynasty), which still quotes previous people's comments on writing and literature, saying, "Writing books and establishing theories must be born out of necessity, only then will the words be appropriate, credible, and useful; therefore, the words of a gentleman reach the principles of things and stop there, not engaging in elaborate rambling, unrestrained grandstanding, taking pleasure in the moment." Another said: "What cannot be cut off from the world is the way of enlightenment, the recording of political affairs, the consoling of the people's troubles, and the delighting in the goodness of others. If such things are beneficial to the world and beneficial to the future, then one article, one more article of benefit." It can be said that the ancients regarded solving social problems and life problems as the sole purpose of writing, as the saying goes, "I would rather record it in practical actions than in empty words." This attitude of writing for life is quite worthy of our approval. However, this attitude is most difficult to maintain: the various schools of thought in the Warring States period each displayed their own ideas, speaking practical words. Qin Shihuang unified the world with Legalism, leaving only the sayings of alchemists and immortals. The pre-Qin Confucians valued integrity most, not straying far from benevolence and righteousness. However, the Western Han Confucians abandoned Confucius and Mencius's ideas of helping the world, painting over them with the colors of yin-yang theory to please the emperor. In the early Qing Dynasty, the great Confucians Gu, Huang, Yan, and Wang, used their knowledge of the classics for practical application, waiting in darkness for a wise ruler to visit, saying, "For the demise of the world, every commoner is responsible." Once the literary inquisitions of Qianlong and Jiaqing arose one after another, scholars only spoke of textual interpretations and dared not discuss worldly affairs at all. Since the First Sino-Japanese War, the ideological world has experienced strong stimulation, and social and life problems have become the center of discussion several times. This type of writing has also been popular like waves, sometimes selling a lot (during the years of Guangxu 27-28 and the Republic of China 9-10 and 17-18, this type of writing was printed everywhere). Now it has turned into a popular period for the Siku Quanshu and the Gujin Tushu Jicheng, "Writing for life" is a path that is not passable, whether in ancient or modern times!</p>
<p>Defense is also quite necessary. However, only making a defense of style without pursuing a fulfilling life will naturally lead to being lost in the fog.</p>
<p>I believe that since the May Fourth Movement, the acquisition of citizen rights by the "novel" is the greatest success in the literary movement. "Novel" is the most important literary style of the past ten years. The groundbreaking contribution of "Call to Arms" will probably forever shine brightly in the history of Chinese literature. If one says that "the only success of modern Chinese literature in the past fourteen years is the success of the essay," then it is a bit of an exaggeration. And the statement that "creative novels, even good ones, come from the training of small essays," if only from the point of view of the cultivation of style (Style), it is not impossible, but this statement can easily mislead some people into thinking that writing good essays makes the creation of novels easy. I think that from the origin of the genre, "novel" is not derived from the small essay. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Brother Liewen:</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Lin Yutang's letter in today's "Free Talk," I cannot remain silent, so I am sending a few words. Lin Yutang's target is entirely me. Now that the curtain has been lifted, I believe there is nothing to avoid, and I must defend myself. I had heard rumors in Shanghai that Lin Yutang was planning a general attack on me, but I had never offended him, so I dared not believe it. Now it has become a reality, leaving me at a loss as to the cause. I have been watching lanterns in Xiashi for four or five days, and continuous rain has delayed my trip. Yesterday it finally cleared up, and my spirits were slightly better. Unexpectedly, I have been dragged into a whirlpool of right and wrong hundreds of miles away. Lin Yutang said that I systematically attacked "Ren Jian Shi" in "Ren Yan," "Ten Days' Talk," "Maodun Monthly," "China Daily," and "Free Talk" under pseudonyms. What evidence does he have? I wrote an article on essays and sketches in "Maodun Monthly," but what is the reason that the other articles must be written by me? If Lin Yutang does not have strong and truthful evidence to prove that the other articles were indeed written by me, he cannot escape the malicious intent of fabricating, creating, and framing me. Why Lin Yutang has such a vicious heart is something I cannot understand now. After watching the lanterns, I will return to Shanghai to investigate the cause and clarify the truth to the world in order to clear my name. If Lin Yutang can reflect on himself, discover his humanity, and be moved by his conscience, he will surely reverse his malicious and harmful thoughts. Then he should have the courage to correct his mistakes, repent sincerely, and apologize to the public. Please publish this letter as it is, because I also want to show Lin Yutang a way to renew himself. Written hastily, no second copy. Zhang Kebiao, April 30th, in Xiashi.</p>

<p>— Written by Mark Twain of America (Translated by Zun Han)</p>
<p>Gong Na helplessly stretched out his scepter, while in his robe, his woman's heart felt very compassionate for the fate of this unfortunate criminal. Tears welled up in his eyes. He opened his mouth to speak, but the Minister of Justice hurriedly said to him, "Don't say it there, Your Highness, don't say it there! It is illegal to pronounce a sentence on a scion of the Duke without sitting on the Duke's throne."</p>
<p>Poor Gong Na shivered. Old Kruggenstein's steel bones also trembled. Gong Na had not yet been crowned! Did he dare to defile the throne? He hesitated and turned around, his face pale with fear. But he had to go. Some people had already cast surprised glances at him. If he hesitated any longer, those glances would become suspicious. He ascended the steps of the throne. Then he stretched out his scepter and said:</p>
<p>"Defendant, I now perform my duties in the name of our lord, Duke Wuli of Brandenburg. Listen to me. According to the ancient laws of the country, you can only be spared death if you hand over your accomplice to the executioner. You can take advantage of this opportunity for rescue. Save yourself, if that is possible; tell the name of the father of that child!"</p>
<p>A grave silence fell upon this highest court, a silence so deep that even the beating of people's hearts could be heard. The Princess slowly turned around, her eyes shining with resentment, and pointed at Gong Na with the index finger of her right hand, saying:</p>
<p>"The father of this child is you."</p>
<p>The painful belief of encountering an irredeemable and hopeless disaster made Gong Na's heart shudder as if dead. What power in the world could save him? To defend himself, he would have to declare that he was originally a woman, but a woman who had not been crowned and defiled the throne would also be sentenced to death. Therefore, he and his violent old father fainted together on the ground.</p>
<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>Whether here or elsewhere, we cannot find the next installment of this heart-stirring and tragic story, not today, and not ever.</p>
<p>The truth is because I put my protagonist (or heroine) in a particularly impossible situation, so I can't think of any way to make him (or her) tell. And I don't want to deal with this matter now either. He should tell himself,</p>
<p>－－－－or leave him there. I originally thought this small difficulty was resolvable, but I changed my mind. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e273">Husband-Seeking Corps <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>During this time of bright spring and pleasant scenery, many women are falling into spring sorrow and boudoir complaints. The so-called "Suddenly seeing the color of the willows on the roadside, regretting having taught my husband to seek a title" is precisely the case. This is just the sadness of heroes, beauties, talented scholars, and beautiful women. Their self-seeking troubles stem from their own deep dreams of being ennobled, or are caused by being moved by the scenery. Those who do not originate from romantic feelings and intentions, but actually "grieve for spring," cannot be compared to these ladies. The Austrian Husband-Seeking Corps is a recent example.</p>
<p>According to a Lin Zi telegram from the Guomin News Agency on the 13th: "Today, hundreds of Japanese women, each carrying their children, flocked to the Prosecutor's Office, begging for the release of their husbands, because their husbands were arrested and imprisoned during the February Incident... The Upper Austrian Governor then met with them, and fifty people represented them. In addition to stating their suffering, the representatives also said that they had no money to buy food and asked for relief." This husband-seeking action is naturally incomparable to those who have a feeling of being咫尺天涯, because they have the enormous threat of having no money to buy food in addition to "suffering."</p>
<p>From this incident, we are reminded of the "decisive action" of the geta-wearing friends in Manchuria a couple of years ago, when the policy of non-resistance was also on the rise. The geta-wearing women of Tokyo, because their husbands had long been conscripted and could not bear the taste of "empty beds and lonely nights," also had a husband-seeking action. Although the traces are close to the feelings of children, the husbands are being restrained by others, losing their freedom, and unable to fly together, leading to the act of sitting and seeking at the door.</p>
<p>If we were to follow the social morality of a Chinese village school, breaking up a couple would damage one's yin virtue, and helping someone to achieve happiness would be better than building a pagoda. Then these politicians have created a large number of resentful men and women who will never be able to escape their blame. However, from the perspective of the new social outlook, we should not criticize this action based solely on its morality. We should examine the universality of this phenomenon, what objective causes have formed it, and how to eliminate these problems.</p>
<p>Clearly, the current social system in various countries, which is cloaked in democracy, is essentially ruled by a minority. All the facilities of national administration are only used to uphold their interests. They use the form of political power to turn their own private wishes into "public interests," and forcefully praise their own attempts as the will of the people. Under this method, countless tragedies of separated families have been enacted in the current society, but they are considered legitimate and justified. For example, under the pressure of hunger and cold, the lives of most people are already uneasy, and society is already uneasy. However, in the name of maintaining peace, they infringe on the freedom of the people as much as possible, and deprive the people of the opportunity to survive as much as possible. As a result, countless orphans and widows are produced. The so-called "peace" is only their own "peace" of infinite enjoyment. Again, like the many wars between nations, it is clearly many financial giants who are forcibly seizing the market and openly robbing, but they want to put some high hats of national glory and victory of the motherland under the form of the nation, so that countless women who have lost their sons and husbands do not criticize because of "glory" and "victory." But this lofty ideal of "raping public opinion" cannot be understood or trusted by every woman. This is why Japanese and Austrian women are asking for bread and work, and there is a husband-seeking action.</p>
<p>At this moment, the sound of world unrest is frequently heard, and the international situation is also particularly urgent. It is unknown how many women's husbands will be forcibly taken away. If we do not break these thoughts of national glory and attitudes of lingering on, then many men will become cannon fodder, and there will be nowhere to seek them back. What is more, if we want to fundamentally eliminate the phenomenon of sacrificing the majority of men for the interests of a minority, that is, to eliminate the phenomenon of husband-seeking, then we can only destroy the system that takes one's own selfish desires as the will of the public.</p>
<p>"Pitiful are the bones by the ever-changing river, still the people in deep boudoirs dreaming." Thinking of this scene on the eve of the Great War already makes people shudder. In addition, many adults regard imprisonment as the only way to maintain peace. Take precautions, prepare in advance, and may countless women who will step into "husband-seeking" encourage each other.</p>
<h3 id="e274">The Naming Question <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>On the 24th, the typesetter of this journal joked with me and arranged the characters "主慈" (Zhu Ci) into "王慰" (Wang Wei) -- the name of an article "青青" (Qing Qing) -- in fact, this is a very ordinary thing: but, strangely enough,巧不巧 (qiao bu qiao), "王慰" (Wang Wei) is my sister's name. When my sister saw it, she wrote a letter and said:</p>
<p>"You little devil! Why are you using my name to publish your boring text?"</p>
<p>After reading the letter, I laughed heartily.</p>
<p>In fact, for us poor scholars, as long as we can see our own words published; as long as we can receive the royalties for each article every month, that is already enough! The matter of naming is really carefree. It is lucky enough to be able to keep the surname passed down by our ancestors without omitting it, which is already satisfactory. Even if the surname is Zhang or Pan, we would never covet it.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of naming, I have three friends with different personalities:</p>
<p>The first friend's surname is Zhao. He can write articles of the "historical" type. His naming is entirely something like "生" (Sheng), "女史" (Nushi). He said:</p>
<p>"If I used my real name, I would definitely be called 'XX Doctor'!"</p>
<p>The second friend's surname is Xu. His production of sketches is extremely large, but he has countless aliases, writing an article as "XX" and another article as "○○". He said:</p>
<p>"My own things are written too sloppily, wouldn't it be terrible if I didn't do this!"</p>
<p>The third friend's surname is Hu. He writes very good novels about triangular love affairs. Once he finishes an article, he sells it to the famous writer Zhang XX for the price of two yuan per thousand words. When publishing a single volume, the name is of course Zhang XX. He said:</p>
<p>"Is a prostitute's selling of chastity her own sin?"</p>
<p>I've talked too much. In short, if the typesetter of this journal looks at this completely boring thing of mine and feels a little apologetic, then I want to answer:</p>
<p>"Brother! What are you talking about! What are you talking about! I don't mind! I don't mind!"</p>
<h3 id="e275">The Mystery of "Animated Divination Diagram" <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>— One of the University Scenes —</p>
<p>In recent days, the dozen or so classmates who live with me in this small building have inexplicably started another commotion. Whether it is in the morning, in the evening, in the plaza, or in the dormitory, as long as three or five people gather together, they are talking about this with great interest:</p>
<p>"It's really strange. You say we are using our own fingers to exert force, so the small tile can move. Why can it also point to characters very clearly? And, our fingers are only lightly touching it, and no force is being used at all."</p>
<p>"Of course! It's not our fingers exerting force; however, this is a bit mysterious, and our intelligence cannot understand it."</p>
<p>"Think about it, China did not lack great diviners in the past; however, it was only because no one passed it down that we have ended up in a situation where everyone is confused. For example, this simplest 'Animated Divination Diagram' was originally something that existed in ancient China. Even now that science has reached its extreme, haven't people still not understood it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that kind of 'Animated Divination Diagram...'." I didn't understand what they were talking about at all, but I felt a little strange in my heart. Later, I asked Lao Lin in private, and he told me the details here:</p>
<p>The "Animated Divination Diagram" is a tool for divination of good and bad fortune. This diagram was created by a certain scholar who studied in Germany, who spent many years researching spiritualism, and improved the old methods inherent in our country. Its style is: a square white paper, three feet on each side, with a strange large human shape of about one and a half inches in diameter drawn in the middle. Around the human shape, there are more than two thousand characters surrounding it. To divine, a small tile with a diameter and a shape similar to that of the circle in the middle is placed upside down in the center of the circle. And an arrowhead shape is drawn on the edge of the tile to be used for pointing to characters. Then, three people use the middle fingers of their three right hands to lightly press on the bottom of the tile, while reciting this spell: "Please, Tile Brother, call XX (whether dead or alive) to come and talk." After half an hour has passed, the small tile will slowly move. (The fingers should naturally not be released.) At this time, you can ask whatever you want, and it can very clearly point to the characters to reply."</p>
<p>After Lao Lin told me these things, he said very seriously:</p>
<p>"It's really effective! If you don't believe it, you can try it. The day before yesterday, I told those Shandong guys in Room X, and at first they didn't believe it. It wasn't until yesterday that they bought it back and personally experimented with it that they believed what I said. Alas! This is really a bit mysterious. I heard that at XX University, almost every student is playing with this thing. The school authorities, in order to maintain the school's reputation, are about to issue a notice to ban it!"</p>
<p>What exactly is going on, I haven't personally experimented with it, so of course I don't dare to say; but, many university students are actually fascinated by this, and I don't quite understand it. Is it that what college students do now is originally something that other people don't understand?</p>
