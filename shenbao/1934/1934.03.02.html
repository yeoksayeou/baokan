<p>溥儀昨日又重新分演登塲。實行其憯號。日人且到處祝。稱爲東亞方面之新事實。就表面觀察。此種做作。已顯見由關東軍司令關東州長官兼大使三位一體之日本軍人包辦指揮。事蹟彰著。無容多贅。不過彼尚欲盡力製造民意。鷹犬四出。强迫人民簽字同意。收買人民上書勸進。以爲溥儀憯號之號召。吾人於此。不能不重新加以分析。爲進一步之認識。以揭穿日帝國主江之而幕。</p>
<p>第一。滿洲傀儡之成立。世界皆知其並非當地民衆有脫離中華民國之。意迄今東北三千萬民衆。依然呻吟於虐政之下。非特對彼無好感。且敵意愈深。不過在鐵蹄蹂躪之下。不能有所反抗耳。過去二年餘之時間。東北三省政權之建立。與東北民衆固無關係。卽其政治上名義負責者。亦不過爲人利用。蓋就事實論。日軍之駐在東北境内者。爲數當在十五萬人以上。其欲藉此武力。挾溥儀爲傀儡。以實行其兼併政策。無可爲諱。再則長春傀儡僞府中所謂總長院長之類。名義雖爲漢奸擔任。實權則操諸有二重國籍日人官吏之手。計此項日籍官吏。爲數已將及千五百名。且各縣各鄉鎭。亦皆遍佈日籍官吏。所謂靖安隊等由當地人民編成之軍隊。率皆由日人訓練。最高之司令權。與最下級之實際統率。無一非爲日本在鄉軍人在關東軍參謀部管轄下活動之工作。卽城市鄉村之警察。亦由日警指揮。更可爲日人實行兼併政策之鐵證。李頓調查團考查東北事情時。日本佈置尚不如現今之週密。但己認定九一八事變爲日軍事前之預謀。至於今日。吾人當更確切認識其隂謀之愈亟。而東北問題之嚴重。尤甚於往昔也。</p>
<p>第二。溥儀旣爲傀儡矣。東北人民旣爲魚肉矣。而日人復進行此一重面幕者又爲何故。蓋日人深知東北三千萬人民。並未甘心屈服。一時雖限於環境。難作正面之鬭爭。然對日仇視之心。終未能忘。同時彼又深悉資本主義組織已届濫熟時期。日本國内之矛盾。尤爲顯著。是以不能不作最後之掙扎以日滿統制經濟相號召。頃者武裝移民失敗。而直接剥削農民方法。繼之以興。鄉村中之牲畜調查也。車輛調查也。地畝清理也。甚至一雞一犬。均須登記。一朝有事。卽可按表索取。使東北整個國民經濟。皆歸其統制。再則日本對外戰爭。以日蘇間之可能性爲多。縱目前尚有經濟恐慌之牽制。或不敢輕於挑釁。然再經若干時日之後。武力鬭爭。勢必不免。以故目前日軍之用意。并不以兼併東北爲止境。彼使溥儀憯號之意。將在伸其魔手於内蒙。劃一大弧形以包圍西比利亞。窺伺華北。吾人於此。尤不可不有嚴重之警覺也。</p>
<p>日本外交。表面雖已轉變其從前之盲目顢頇。而爲温和之折衝。實質則仍未嘗稍變。或者可謂之爲進一步。蓋其意無非欲對外調和衝突。消弭惡化。在國際間求得一出路。出路而得。卽有辦法以進行其一貫之政策。不得則不惜冒險硬幹。以爲孤注之一拚。目前之所以暫時相安。不過在其尋求出路時偶然之停頓耳。可知當前之危機與將來之禍患。仍在劇烈醖釀中。故溥儀憯號之一幕。雖謂爲日人藉以試探列强之一手叚。亦無不可也。</p>

<p>川帮洋雜貨業改運國產物件</p>
<p>運費漲後造成日貨傾銷機會</p>
<p>該帮决派代表向社會同請願</p>
<p>川河各輪、同盟漲價、引起川帮之反響已歷誌本報、最受痛苦者、厥爲洋雜貨帮、但該帮名爲洋雜貨、近年已完全改銷國貨、今次川輪漲價、不合情理、甚有水脚超過貨本者、將使該業無法經營、現以呼籲無效、决向社會局請願、記者昨赴各方、調查所得、詳述如下</p>
<h3 id="c135">議訂運率不公 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>川輪同盟漲費、以救濟航業·提高水脚·維持成本·爲號召、但當各輪公司代表、於議訂新貨價時、由一華人李某與一俄人、擬定水脚、而於成本微薄·裝箱量尺·之洋雜貨、（其實均係國產品、並無一種洋貨）水脚增加至超過貨本、更以毛尺收費、此種不合情理之新水脚、一旦综行、實將運川銷售之國貨一網打盡、至不能營業、該帮曾公議要求修改此項運費、以昭公允、乃爲輪局方面所拒絶、</p>
<h3 id="c136">新價超越貨本 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>所稱洋雜貨者、卽搪瓷器·牙刷·絲紗襪·熱水瓶·玻璃杯·小孩玩具·與鋼精器具·電木碗盞·以及牙粉·風燈·等類、名色繁多、全爲我國工廠所自造、上年此項國貨、廉價出售、運往四川、亦屬不少、輪公司水脚單内、統列入洋雜貨一欄、其實成本不大、每裝一箱、例如占三十尺面積者、貨本不過六七十元、因多數貨件、頗占地位故也、今次川輪新水脚、將該項貨品、漲至八十元一噸、每噸以四十尺計、則一箱貨物、運費需六十元、而不分毛凈、以尺收費、在實際上、水脚價、較貨本更巨、</p>
<h3 id="c137">國貨無法運川 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>洋雜貨帮、對於該項新運費、實使國貨無法運川、縱使貨價因運費巨大酌增、然斷不能將一元貨漲售二元、是今之漲價、顯使業國貨者、無形中斷絶其經營之路、在此日貨正謀傾銷之際、不啻爲其造一絶好機會、因日貨利用其本國船舶、向揚子江上游、源源推銷、其結果不僅川帮洋雜貨業受重大損失、卽國貨亦蒙其打擊矣、</p>
<h3 id="c138">請求救濟民生 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>太古·怡和·捷江·等、因屬洋商、今次漲價、情尚可原、而在川河中船舶最多、勢力最大、標榜民生主義之民生公司、旣爲華商、正宜對於辐貨運川、加以援助、乃改訂水脚時、卽出於該公司代表所主張、但顧水脚之增多、不計民生之痛苦、尤爲該帮所痛心、現川帮洋雜貨業、除巳實行停止辦貨外、决推舉代表、赴社會局請願、抑平此不合情理之運費、而使甫立萌芽之國貨、不致受重大之摧折、請求書巳在草擬中、卽日便將遞呈</p>

<p>川輪加入公約者、全部共有七家、唯招商局因峨嵋擱淺、無船行駛、故未加入、此外尚有日清公司、不入同盟、漲費之後、捷江第二船宜平號、民生第二船民康號、已於昨日出口、僅有少數棉紗、洋雜貨竟無一件雙方相持、日輪已在計劃、乘機恢復川河航輪、旣不受公約之束縛、兼可自由上落運費、以圖攪運、届時洋雜貨帮以其運費之谦、勢必致載日船、實民生等所造成也、鷸蚌相爭、漁翁得利、誠痛心事也、</p>

<p>自從上次發表了「論學習語文」（見二月六·七·八·日本欄）一文以後、接着就有許多讀者來信，對於這個問題有所質疑，例如黄立雄君問：</p>
<p>（一）「格律聲色」是否單是古文纔有？研究新文學的人值得去費力嗎？</p>
<p>（二）「神理氣味」「陽剛隂柔」怎樣吟味？</p>
<p>（三）研究古文有什麽好處？</p>
<p>（四）現在的語文是否言文一致？</p>
<p>（五）自己有時看别人的文章，常常碰着許多形容詞或名詞，把握不住它們的意思，例如「神理氣味」「格律聲色」這些字面，有什麽法子補救？</p>
<p>談夢若君問：</p>
<p>（一）關於本國文學，據先生談，現代人應研究現代文，但是據說爲一國的國民應堂明白或是看懂一切的史籍。古人所留給後人的文字，正如同一件具體的機件，需要後來人的們更改與熔合以成一獨立的風格。又一說則謂諸子百家是調味，二十四史是原料，於今新文學作家莫不讀過古書云云。然則是否要成爲專家，纔必須讀古文，若僅求得和使用普通文字，就不心去讀古文，以免多兜圈子呢？</p>
<p>上列的問題，綜合起來，可分爲三種：（一）爲什麽讀國文不要從古文着手？（二）「格律聲色」「神理氣味」怎樣解釋？（三）言文是否一致？兹一一答覆如下：</p>
<p>（一）爲什麽讀國文不要從古文入手？</p>
<p>關於這個問題上次己有討討，本不願再說，但是一般讀者却仍舊米戀着古文，所以仍應簡單地申述我們的理由。</p>
<p>第一，我們知道文字是傳達思想的媒介，祗要把思想說明，表現思想的工具是可以不問的。然而思想起了大的變更，社會組織發生了大的變化，那語文卽傳達思想的媒介也是不得不變更的。因爲舊的形式，在這時是不能暢達新的思想了。現在我們中國的思想，受歐美的影響，起了重大的變化，因此，隨之而起的就有所謂「文學革命」，其原因就是文字形式與組含的簡單，不能傳達新思想。這是事實，也是現在一般翻譯科學書者，所共同感覺到的。上次我們所舉的嚴幾這翻譯原富，不能暢達原意，是一個狠明顯的例子。</p>
<p>第二，從用的「字」講，我們知道文字是不斷的在進行着新陳代謝的作用。一方面他在製造新字，加添組合語；一方面却也在淘汰着舊的字。其理由也與前述相同，就是人類知識日增，言語亦必隨之而廣，所以舊的字就感覺到不够用，不能作新觀念的符號。另一方面，則許多舊時代的舊觀念，在後來已經不存在，於是那些代表舊觀念的「字」，因爲不合用，就慢慢的爲人所忘記，而逐漸淘汰了。（關於這，讀者可參看陳望道著「修辭學發凡」第六十七頁及吕思勉著「字例略說」文字之孳乳與洮汰兩章）</p>
<p>第三，上面兩個理由是說文字的變遷，這還是我們要用現代文的理由。換句話說，讀者讀國文，如爲實用起見，是一定要讀現代文的。現在我們所要指出的，是學習現代文應從古文入手嗎？這是讀者所最懷疑而急需要求解答的。讀者讀現代文，爲什麽不應從古文入手，其理由是這樣的。我們的文字，在現時不論在體裁，句法，用字方面，都發生了大的變動，它己與古文相差得很逺，當然字仍舊是古代傳下來的。談君來信把古文比做一具機械，這是可以的，但他的解釋却差誤了。假如古文是一具舊的機械，那現代文就是一具根據舊機械加以大大的改良的新機械。不錯，新機械是舊機械的後身，是舊機械的演進。然而學習使用機械的人，却不必要從學習使用舊機械入手。使用新機械的方法，雖則有些地方與舊機械相同，但大部分却兩樣了。所以會用舊機械的人，如果要用新機械，也須要從新學習。當然他的學習是要較没有學習過機器的人便當些，然而這是不足爲訓的，因爲在對於新舊機械都不會使用的人，他又何必要費兩道手脚，去學習兩種使用法呢？他爲了使用新機器起見，是應當直接去學習新機器使用法，舊機器使用法許多是新機器上不要的，學習了有什麽用處呢？我們所以勸人學習國文從現代文入手的理由是在此。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c194">來件提高銀價與中國之購買力穆家驥 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>美國提高銀價、以增加逺東購買力之說、我人在近數年内聞之熟矣、最近此種聲浪、愈唱愈高、大有卽須實行之趨勢、至於實行提高銀價、是否眞能增加逺東之購買力、逺東將受如何影響、將有何種防禦之方法、回答此種種問題、就是本文的使命了、首先有二點須加說明、（一）所謂提高逺東購買力、其實祗指中國而言、因印度自一八九川年放棄銀本位、對内用銀、對外用金、所以銀價之高下、對於印度、没有多大影響、（二）所謂提高銀價、是指銀價的單獨價格、而不與其他物價同時提高、假使銀價與一般物價同時提高、於我國也没有多大的害處、譬如前數年物價與銀價同時下跌、所以理論上利害與事實不同、（參閱拙著「近四年來中國對外經濟中之貨幣問題」載中央銀行月報二十二年十二月期）在此次世界經濟恐慌之前數年、各國經濟繁榮、至於極點、此種現象、在美國最爲顯著、當時有極盛行之名字曰「新時代」（ＮewＥra）、就是說當時經濟狀况、已到了一個新時代、以後惟有向黄金的道上走去、决不會回復到戰前經濟循環的痛苦、誰知道一九二九年紐約證劵價格大跌、以後一切物價、節節下降、有人找不出恐慌的眞原因而徬徨、有人以爲此種現象不過是臨時的、决不會有極大的影響、同時有人乘機倡言物價之所以下跌、實以銀價跌落（其實自一九二七年印度實行出賣存銀後銀價卽下降到一九二九年末卽隨了一般物價而暴跌了）爲主要原因中之一、譬如紐約著名銀行家拉蒙（ＴhomasＷＬamon）在一九三０年初說、「世界經濟恐慌之主要原因、爲黄金之缺乏與銀價之下落、」而胡佛總統於一九三０年十月二日在克利夫倫銀行總會内演說、分析恐慌之原因、中有云、「中國與印度之購買力、旣視銀價而定、至今也大受打擊了、」此種論調、在恐慌發軔之一二年内、屢見不鮮、但是到了後來對於恐慌的原因、經過相當研究後、除了白銀派及與逺東商務有關係者外、此種論調、漸形消滅、今根據事實考察銀價跌落、是否爲經濟恐慌之大原因、反過來就可以說提高銀價是否爲救濟恐慌之一策、兹將一九三０年與一九三一年各主要國出入口價值之增减百分數、列表如下、</p>
<p>（一）進口</p>
<p>較一九二　　較一九三</p>
<p>一九三０年九年增加（十）或减少　一九三一年０年增加（十）或</p>
<p>（一）　　　（一）</p>

<p>法　（一）九·八％　　（一）一九·六％</p>
<p>（二）出口</p>

<p>日　（一）三一·九％　（一）二一·八％</p>
<p>法　（一）一四·七％　（一）二八·九％</p>
<p>上表觀之、我國進口貨物、以銀計算之價值、只有增加而並没有减少、至於以金計算之價值、則一九三０年較一九二九年减百分之二十七、而一九三一年較一九三０年减百分之二十、但美國與日本之進口貨物、也有同樣的减少、還有一層、不可不注意者、就是我國人口雖占全世界人口五分之一以上、而對外貿易數量、常在全世界國際貿易總值百分之二、五左右、所以我國一九三０年之進口、以金計算、减少百分之二十七、其實在全世界國際貿易中、僅不過減少不足百分之一而已、（卽百分之二十七乘百分之二·五）整個世界國際貿易中、减少不足百分之一的數量、其影響於世界經濟恐慌的程度、也可以想見了、至於出口方面、我國以金計算之價值、其縮减程度、幾乎比較表内任何國家爲多、與理論上銀價跌落、可以奬勵出口之說不符、其實因爲我國是生產不足的國家、而農產品價格暴跌、與海外不景氣的緣故、出口就减少得多了、從上述的情形看起來、銀價的下降、並不是此次世界經濟恐慌的一個原因、似無疑義了、但是仍有白銀派及與東方商務有關係者還是高唱着提高銀價、以增加逺東購買力之說、不但高唱而已、且在美國已具有相當勢力、有逼迫政府實行之可能、以下試述銀價實行提高之後、與我中國有何影響、但兹事體大、所述亦不過其犖犖大者而已、在叙述以前、首將「銀價」兩字弄個明白、在各國未放棄金本位以前、所謂銀價、卽指白銀以金計算之價值、而我國對外匯價、也就隨了這個價格、在相當範圍内共同上下、迨各國放棄金本位以後、所謂銀價、卽指白銀以紙幣計算之價格、譬如一九三一年九月二十一日、英國放棄金本位以後之倫敦銀價、卽指白銀以紙磅計算之價值、我國對英匯價、也就隨了這個價格、在相當範圍内、共同上下、其餘各國放棄金本位後、均可依此類推、我們須知道自各國放棄金本位以後、銀價（卽白銀以紙磅或紙美元計算之價格）及我國之對外匯價、早巳提高了許多、尤其是在去年的一年中、換句話說、各國放棄金本位以後、他們紙幣的對外價值、自然下跌、而其結果反使我國貨幣價值被勤提高、這種情形、已有一二年的歷史了、明瞭了這一二年内我國所受的影響、就可以推想到以後銀價再提高後的影響了、最可注意的一點、就是我國爲用銀國、而非產銀國、故自一九一０年後、除了歐戰期間以外、年年輸入大量的白銀、但是去年又像歐戰期間的情形一樣、國外銀價、高於國内銀價、我國竟因此而變爲白銀之輸出者、價值約合五千萬元之鉅、我們還記得在一九三０年與一九三一年時、國外銀價暴跌、致使國内銀價高於國外銀價、便有大批現銀流入我國、這種現象、（就是一物從價低的市塲、跑到價高的市塲、）假使不加阻止、能像水之就下、而源源流出、近一二年來、白銀因受國外高價的吸引、已經出口去了不少、假使銀價再行提高、白銀之輸出、勢必更多於去年、不產銀的用銀國家、輸出大批的現銀、其影響及於國家經濟、自然非常之大、可以不言而喻了、銀價提高後、除白銀之輸出外、我國進出口貨物所受之影響、亦必不小、現在各國正患生產過剩、而我國則患生產不足、銀價提高後、國外過剩之物品、又將以我國爲尾閭、大批輸入、根據近一二年内的事實、卽可證明、依著者觀察、我國經濟恐慌、不自一九二九年始、而自一九三一年末各國放棄金本位時起、當然一九三一年後、我國經濟大受九一八與一二八之重大打擊、但是一九三一年以前所未聞、而其後報紙上無日不載之外貨傾銷、、大部份是跌幣傾銷）也是很大的原因、假使銀價再提高、我國工商之倒閉風潮、恐將更有甚於今日者、出口方面、也有極不利的影響、因爲我國海外市塲、已被他人奪去、銀價再提高後、我國出口物以金計算之價值、也須提高、因此我國出口商品在國外之銷路、將更形减少、提高銀價的結果旣如是、所謂增加逺東購買力之說、不但不可能、反使我國經濟更大受損傷、而購買力亦必因之而更形减低耳、然則購買力如何可以提高、則惟有增加生產而已、因爲貨幣不過是交易之媒介、所出者多、所入者亦需多、以資平衡、無論個人或國家、都是如此、非提高或减低一國貨幣之價值、所能有補於國家之購買力者也、故行將舉行之生產會議、實負有重大之使命、銀價提高、對於我國之影響、已如上述、我國爲自衛計、不得不取斷然的方策、第一凡與我國固有或將與之工商業有害的或不需要的進口商品、當課以重稅、或竟禁其入口、以免國内工商業之破產、我們須認明這種跌幣傾銷稅、並不增加消費人之負担、目的在於保持國内物價之平衡、第二在相當時期内、禁銀出口、也是必然的步驟、以免現銀之外流、末了以現狀觀之、當有一永久的研究銀問題之組織、因爲我國一日不脫離銀本位、銀價問題、確是一個切身的問題、當有永久的組織繼續的研究、以免臨　而　　　、</p>

<h3 id="c233">捧死人 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>中國人的習慣，向來是歡喜替死人捧塲的，一個很平凡的人，在他死後往往會給人家捧得彷彿眞是了不得的大人物一樣。譬如厚得超過了二三寸的大訃聞，長得遮斷了一條馬路的大出喪。以及借報本堂開弔，逢七做道塲等等，嚴格的說起來，當然都是捧死人的勾當，不過因爲捧者與被捧者之間，不是父子，便是夫婦，多少總有些親屬的關係，所以在旁邊人看來，雖明知他這一舉顯然是馬過放砲，借着捧死人做題目，其實在替他自已張揚，但還不覺得如何肉麻。其最肉麻不過者，莫如一般不相干的人，在某一個似乎有名，似乎無名的中等人物壽終正寢之後，跟着幾個與死者略有些微關係的人扯順風旗，在報紙上不分晝夜的發表文章捧他或伊。</p>
<p>此風雖然由來已久，不料至今乃益甚！</p>
<p>某詩人死了，生前本來是絶對没有人提及的，死後竟有不少的刋物替他出專號；也許這些刋物的編者，在詩人生前確曾三番兩次的，用極冷酷的面孔，拒絶過詩人的投稿呢！更也許許因爲詩人並不能像徐志摩一般的出名，當他生前，有不少的人在旁邊「用詩人」這兩個字竭力的在譏笑他；待他一死之後，這些不少的人便立刻掉轉口吻，用「我友」「或中國的現代詩人」等稱謂，很誠懇地在替他寫捧塲的文章了！</p>
<p>最近，一個在生前除伊自己偶然寫幾篇文章未享大名的電影女演員艾霞死了，這個消息一傳佈開來之後，捧死人的文章便像潮湧似的在報紙上發現了，要如有人替伊一一剪下來，印一本「哀思錄」，我想至少應有申報年鑑一樣的厚；而從此艾霞的聲名，竟岌岌乎要超過胡蝶陳玉梅了，但是伊己經死了！</p>
<p>惟其因爲這個人是死了，我們才要捧他，惟其因爲這個人已經死了，對於我將不再會有什麽妨碍，我們才可以放心托膽的捧他！</p>
<p>唉！冷酷的人們啊！爲什麽你們不願在一個人的生前，給與他一些比較實惠的帮助呢？</p>
<h3 id="c234">預言之迷 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>來「預言，」幾成一種不可思議的神秘：你！儻若不相信，指爲吾中國學者頽廢没落，和思想上厭亂而露出的無聊文字；那末像外國威爾斯，斯摩斯亞爾倍洛克，什麽大家都認佗呌作「預言專家」呢？甚且爲「預言之聖，」尊重得萬分崇高，可見並非是没有憑據：不過淺識的人們，蟄伏在懵懂糊塗的氛圍裏，還未能醒覺；所以不論那一個刦數，終不會前知，但到禍害臨頭，方纔明白，然而已經不及避免了！</p>
<p>我姑置世界上大事如戰爭等等不談，縮小講現在的滿洲僞國，那一位溥儀先生，不是說在三月一日僭號麽？唉！這一回事，想到民國元年×月×日隆裕下詔退位時候，溥儀在位僅僅三年十二月五日：從他清世祖入關，主我中國，一共經過了十代，歷二百六十有八個年頭；直到溥儀退位，那就胡運告終，結束了一部外人入主中夏的穢史；然而尚擁著尊號，安居故宮，受民國的優禮，覺羅氏的亡没，亦可算自古未曾有過的遭遇了！但不料九一八事變發生，日寇佔據遼吉以後，遂有土肥原和鄭孝胥金梁熙洽張海鵬等一流人，溥儀原來伏處張園，打打網球，不出津門一步的；喂！到此就不得不走大連，去趕這勾當，雖在日人僞組織勢力之下，而重温帝夢，自然願意入他們的彀中了：</p>
<p>前天碰見老友某君，從關外回來，說著：這一位溥儀先生，不久要僭號，他以爲正合「黄蘖禪的詩讖兩句話兒：建統偏安三十六，坐看境外血如縻，」「建統」就是宣統，初起日人土肥原等，想在東三省建立一個「明光帝國，」後來没有成功，待挾溥儀出關，到了今日，就有「康德」年號的出現：「三十六，」就是應著世界大戰，須到千九百三十六年方開始，到這時候，所謂滿洲國中的傀儡，像木人頭一般，隨人左右，又應著境外血如縻，唯有坐以待斃的一法，舍此是没有出路，要求得像清亡的當兒十分安全，咦！那眞是在黑地裏夢想了！這幾句話：雖則是近於讖緯家的談吐，細細體味，也有些前知的推測，恐怕將來逃不出這個刦運罷！</p>

<h3 id="c237">電燈省電的常識 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 素</p>
<p>西曆一八七九年美國大科學家愛迪生發明電燈以後，不久，便普及世界了，現在我國稍大的城市，也都有它的踪跡。尤其是在最繁華的上海，每晚都和它相處，成爲日常必需品之一，並且每月所支的電費，和水費一樣，同爲日常用費的大宗，我們確有設法節省的必要。現在把我所知道的三個方法，分别寫在下面，供讀者的參考。</p>
<p>一、查看電壓</p>
<p>每個燈泡的電壓，在燈頭上都有數字標明，通常所用的都爲二百弗打Ｖott，因所引電綫的電壓也是如此，是經變壓器制定的。若燈泡的電壓太低，燈絲便易燒斷，電壓太高，燈光便覺不亮。所以最好用二百弗打的燈泡，光力旣强，且又省費。</p>
<p>二。更換燈泡</p>
<p>普通燈泡用到八九個月時（以每日用四小時計算），便失去效用，這是燈絲被電流所發的高熱燒斷的緣故，但在五個月後，燈絲已漸溶爲蒸氣，附着泡上，使燈光日益昏暗，這時勢必添裝電燈，纔能恢復以前的光亮，這所添的電費，便是因舊泡而消耗的。所以燈泡用到五六月時，便當換去，這是很合算的。</p>
<p>三、用哈夫泡</p>
<p>前面說過，普通燈泡用到相當時期，便要發暗，但現在却有個救濟的方法，就是在眞空泡裏，輸入氮氣或氬氣，燈絲便能展緩熔化了，這種呌做氮氣泡或氬氣泡，又因這燈泡每燭光僅需電力半華脫Ｗat，所以也呌做泡ＨalfＷattＬamp，上海各電料行都有出售，價值雖比普通泡約貴一倍，可是很能耐久，省電又多。如同用二百弗打的普通泡和哈夫泡，在各費電力一百華脫時，普通泡僅能放八十七燭光，而哈夫泡却能放二百燭光，超過普通泡二倍以上的光力。所以採用哈夫泡，實是極省電的事。</p>
<p>以上三個方法，都是我試騐過的，很有效騐，請位不妨也試一下。家裏若裝幾盞電燈，所省固然有限，若裝幾十幾百盞電燈，爲數便很大了，這也是家庭經濟中一件節流的事。</p>
<h3 id="c238">望大家這樣的做 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>

<p>現在中國社會上失業呌苦的人多半是青年；然而有爲的人也只有青年。因此我們過去出而組織一個生活社，今將我們的現在與將來寫在下面，有望指正。我們共十人，五人暫爲教師，將所得之資，各支十五元爲生活費，餘爲資本。自四月起五個月的時間，現時我們已有租屋一所，租田六畝，黄牛一頭，蜜蜂二箱，大小鷄百餘。預算明年秋後將教資收入全爲資本。三年以後，我們全數加入，由耕養而至於山林。五年之後，父母弟妹亦得加入而爲燒火牧畜了。十年後要有二萬元以上可值之資本。現將組織大意寫下。</p>
<p>各人只有生活費，而無薪金。</p>
<p>食居住除不得已用錢外，皆由已造。</p>
<p>每人每日二小時讀書，半小時教村鄰的兒童。</p>
<p>五年内一人在國内參觀實業，以便發展。</p>
<p>十年後可供出國讀書之資。</p>
<p>逐年每人乎種樟腦樹百枝及探查本地的礦產。</p>
<p>希望全國柔弱的青年皆如此實行而爲有用的農人。</p>

<p>自强回頭看時，原來父親和岳母，都送到了大門口來着呢。到了這時，自强無論有多硬的心腸，也不能抛開不顧，只得扭轉身，又跑回到父親面前來，這就向着老人家一鞠躬道：你老人家别送了，我一切皆會放心的。口裏說着，看到父親肩膀上，沾染了一些塵灰，這就伸着手，輕輕的在父親肩上拍着。趙翁手握住了旱烟袋桿，眼望着他，咳嗽了兩聲，點着頭道：好罷，你去罷。江氏靠了門框站着，自己牽自己的衣襟，這就向自强道：姑爺你一切都保重，家裏的事，我自會照管。自强還有什麽話說呢，只有兩隻手按在胸面前，不住的向人鞠躬。桂枝還逺逺的站在前面呢，就呌道：快上車站罷，别誤了時間。自强是老軍人，軍人的習慣，早己養成了。這時是在大門外，就不自然而然的，挺着胸桿子，舉手行了個軍禮，然後立着正，轉身而去。這一回他是下了决心了，一點不肯回頭來看着。桂枝在後面跟着，也開了大步子走，口裏還數一二三四。他們家離長途汽車站不逺，只轉一個彎就到了。等他停住了脚，桂枝笑道：你是一個軍人，怎麽作事這般不利落，臨别的時候，只管牽牽扯扯。自强歎了口氣，立刻又把胸襟挺着，笑道：你這話對了，我們要拿出一些大丈夫的樣子來。小林將行李放在身邊，突然的却問出一句話來道：連長，你這回趕回喜峯口去，不是快要打仗嗎？這句話，教自强怎樣的答復？就是桂枝心裏，明知道事實上或不免如此，但是總希望不至於如此才好，所以千回萬轉，總不肯把這樣一句話，說到口裏來。（三二五）</p>

<h3 id="c240">刀與筆 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 胡然</p>
<p>印度曾有某革命家問×國人道：你們征服印度是用刀抑是用筆呢？如用筆，則印度可以爭处自由；如用刀，則印度雖不武，折骨頭以爲武器，也可以爭得自由的。旨哉斯言！</p>
<p>這話很悲凉！在重重壓迫和束縛之下，漸漸使希望從大轉小，從小而無。在無希望的絶望中，使許多雄大的心化爲死灰，沸騰的血變爲冷血。然而蘿茤入定若干年之後，忽而給人用方法搥撼，醒悟過來，這時却昇起虚空，作大神變化，起烈火焚身，並死灰和冷血亦無。這便成爲許多改革者的先例。</p>
<p>答覆這類絶望的呼聲並不難的，那是無所謂刀或筆，却是代印度造成得到自由的凖備云云。這種話是很可敷衍一時，可以哄小孩重復入睡的。隨便那一種中國東西，西洋人拿去了只加上「租借」兩字便要使咱們心平氣和。總之×國的大仁大義，無非暫時替印人管理印度而已。</p>
<p>其實那答覆呢？據旁觀者看來，是用了刀也用筆。譬如殺人者，刀也：殺後而有罪狀者，筆也。聲電致討者，筆也；興師動衆者，又是刀也。×國人用武的方法征服印度後，必有文的方法加以管理。這時當然有種種應當服從×國人的大道理產生，或者催眠，或者麻醉，或者悲觀論。倘若在這種境况下還不服統治呢？很簡單的，再用刀就是了。正如小孩夜裏醒來不要睡了，大人當設法哄之入睡，哄技窮時怎樣呢，便打了。</p>
<p>然而究竟也不甚行，歷史上總可見輪轉的變遷，而少見一貫直線的進展。舊說人與天息息相通，天旣不窮，則人心也無盡日。變成傷心或死心的境地後，折骨可以爲兵，自奮也可絶脰。這更證明天意與人心之難量，而世界是從來不能平靜的。</p>
<h3 id="c241">談「太平歌」 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>「元宵佳節」到了，不禁令我想起故鄉的「太平歌」來。</p>
<p>在童年，有兩種鄉土的藝術，給了我深刻的印象。一種是驢皮影，另一種就是「太平歌」。自然，鼓兒詞和戲本也曾給我以相當的興趣，但「太平歌」和驢皮影給我的印象却比較强烈。這也許是因爲這兩種東西的鄉土性大衆性比較强烈的緣故罷。</p>
<p>每逢年節，這兩種東西給與民衆很大的快樂。那不只限於城鎭，而是普遍到各個村莊的。就着應節令之點來說，驢皮影是隨時可以演唱的而「太平歌」却只在正月間可以唱。也許那是迎春的一種演扮罷。在唱驢皮戲和唱「太平歌」時，鄉村間，眞是人山人海，熱閙極了。一九三零年夏，我還在吉林省城的江南，看過最後一次的驢皮影，可是觀衆已没有以前那樣熱烈了。而「太平歌」呢，因爲「少小離鄉」的原故，已有二十來年没有機會欣賞了。</p>
<p>驢皮影，一名灤州影。大概是由灤州商人移植到「關東城」的。東北商業，以前十九是握在昌黎，樂亭，灤州，撫寗諸縣人的手裏。那麽，驢皮影在東北可算是一種外來的藝術。而「太平歌」則是東北的土生的藝術。若是依據友人胡君的說法：皮影是灤河流域的藝術，而「太平歌」則是遼河流域的藝術。</p>
<p>「太平歌」一名「洋歌」。鄉下人說話時是說「唱洋歌」。寫在紙上就是「太平歌」。新年開頭，「好勝」的人們就着手籌辦「洋歌」，自然，這是需要紳士和財主們的後援的。地，割收完了，糧石，賣的賣了，存的存了，當一年工作完了，慶祝新年的時節，那些好勝帮閑的人們便舉辦「洋歌班」，預慶未來一年的「人壽年豐」。「洋歌」是化裝的行列的舞蹈。應和着鑼鼓鈸鐃的音樂的節奏，三二十人，或四五十人，扮着男女老幼的各種奇裝，打了一個圓場，轉圈地走着，舞蹈着。在某一時間的間隔之内，週期地，樂隊止住了音樂，舞者止住了跳躍，有一個人從行列里出來，張開扇子，面對上方，唱出一首七言絶句般的「洋歌調」。前三句唱完時，便奏一陣音樂，等後一句唱完時，則又是音樂和蹈舞。</p>
<p>在熱鬧的時節，「洋歌」是在街中或村中的中心點「打場兒」的，觀衆自然是圍着看啦。在一般的時節，「洋歌」循環地走串各商店各大家，觀衆跟隨在後邊到處走着看。在各家的院裏，「洋歌」打了塲，舞蹈，歌唱，有時是十分鐘，有時是二十分鐘，看情形。唱的歌，多半是恭頌商店發財和紳士財主們的家道興隆的。對於作官的人家，自然，是慶祝昇官，對於鄉紳財主，則是慶祝年豐的。紳商照例是要多額地打賞的了。</p>
<p>在「洋歌」的扮脚中，有「老韃子」，反穿洋皮袍，身上帶着銅串鈴，有「大脚老婆」，是男人扮女裝的，半老徐娘樣。還有别的，我可記不起來了。</p>
<p>「洋歌調」裏，好多是現成的，如「十二月裏」，如「十二月裏採茶」等等。形式什九是七言四句。然而，也有新制的，歌者隨機應變編成的。待我寫下我記憶中的幾首罷：</p>
<p>「一進大門抬頭觀，觀見上方燈籠竿，燈籠竿上四個大字，（樂）五榖豐登太平年」。</p>
<p>「櫻桃好吃樹難栽，洋歌好唱口難開，要吃櫻桃化錢買，（樂）要唱洋歌抺下臉來」。</p>
<p>正月裏來正月正，白馬銀槍小羅成，人人都說羅成小，（樂）夜打登州救秦瓊」。</p>
<p>「二月裏來龍抬頭，萬歳皇爺來使牛，正宮國母來送飯，（樂）鞭打犂牛萬年收」。</p>
<p>「一進大門鼕鼕鼕，你老院子賽如北京，上房好似金鸞殿，（樂）院墻好似紫禁城」。</p>
<p>前四首是現成的，後一首是應時卽吟的。</p>
<p>看見鄭振鐸先生的「一九三三年的古籍發見」中提到「影詞」，我就想起了這種遼河流域的民間文藝「洋歌調」，而覺得這一個豐富的寳庫，值得學者文人的注意。節届「元宵」，更使我感到了喚起人注意這一個寳庫的必要了。我不知道在内地各省中，是否也「太平歌」這種東西。不過，在遼河流域淪於夷狄的今後，也許鐵蹄的踐踏，會使這一類文藝淪亡，以致於失傳。我們似應趁早把「洋歌調」搜集一下罷。難處是，這一類東西，似並無抄本。大多數還是須靠口傳。</p>
<h3 id="c242">古爾卡 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>古爾卡是滇緬交界的一個要地，位在野人山中的。由雲南千崖壩的巒綫街向南行，走半天山路便到了。在那兒，没有街市，没有村莊，只有一條小小的山溝，從緑樹翠竹的山中流了出來，復向叢崖密箐流了進去。光緒末年的劃界條約，便是藉着這條山溝把緬甸和中國劃分開的。山溝上架着一座西式鐵橋，耀眼地標出了二十世紀的文明風姿。而在山溝旁邊，則伏着一間矮小的野人茅棚，一切原始時代的隂影，却還依舊遺留着哩。</p>
<p>在橋上憑欄觀看，南面蜿蜒着平整的山道，上舖白皚皚的細石，顯出了雨後的凈潔。路邊排立着灰青色的鉛柱，電綫的鐵絲横於上面，伸入逺處的樹叢，時爲山風激動，發出營營的聲音。想來走進南歐那些山中，現在旅人眼前的景色，大約也不外是這樣的吧？同時回頭來望望北面呢，山路旣是崎嶇的，復又積着雨後的泥濘，無論由誰看來，都難免不起着行路難那樣的感嘆了。接到中國城市去的電綫，雖也不缺，但電綫柱子却是粗大的竹竿作成，頗現寒傖的樣子。好在那時我對中國已没多大的熱望，所以在兩兩相形之下，應生的感懷，確是一點也不曾起過。只像一個道地的流浪人似的，欣欣然踏入新鮮的境地。</p>
<p>那年我到這兒的時候，正是微雨之後的正午，天突然睛明了，四週披滿緑衣的山峯，都呈着浴後一般的清新。空氣裏到處浮蕩着野草嫩枝的香味。溪水響着潺潺的聲音，流到逺處，便化入萬山靜寂的懷裏。當時在橋側小茅棚中，吃了一頓野人所做的飲食，至今回想起來，尚覺怪有趣味的。起初看見這座唯一的小茅棚，不管牠是怎樣的卑陋，總覺得在這舉目都是山峯緑樹的環境裏面，無論如何都要减去旅人許多孤寂之感的。但後來低頭鑽進去，發現主人是那麽樣兒的時候，心便禁不住跳動起來，彷彿走進了賣人肉包子的黑店一般。因爲主人的腰上懸着一把齊頭的長刀（佩刀是野人的風俗，每個成年男子都必須帶的。他們卽使在當兵的時候，於荷槍之外，都不離這把祖傳的長刀）臉兒又天然帶着不馴之氣。兩片嘴唇，由於常嚼檳榔的原故，露出彷彿剛才生啖過人血的光景。頭上纒着的黑布帕子，餘剩一節，筆直地豎在髮上，活畫出緑林好漢那樣的風度。在這樣一個主人的招待之下吃飯，而又在寂寥的萬山叢中，誰還能够忘記呢？那一次吃的菜，除了一竹筒有着淡黄菜葉的湯外，便是一小包樹菜包着的　　　了（　　　　　　　還不敢下箸　（說是下　　了，其實是用承抓來吃飽，因爲根本就没有筷子）</p>
<p>經同行的旅伴解說一通，才抓在嘴裏嘗嘗，覺得那是異樣的脆香，非常可口哩。吃的時候，没有桌子，没有凳子，只是像呌化子似的，蹲在地上罷了。這麽地吃了一餐，便登上西式的橋頭，向北揮一揮手，就同中國告别了，心下没有湧出一點兒惜别的情緒。</p>
<p>過橋去，不逺的地方，在大路旁邊，伸展着另一條小小的烏道，這是通到近處軍營地方去的。那裏住得有印度的陸軍，防守着緬甸的邊疆，而且隨時都負着有推廣的責任的，</p>

<p>— 白燕</p>
<p>母親咕嚕的埋怨；妻流着淚。</p>
<p>年青的丈夫心裏似刀絞一般的難受；垂着頭。</p>
<p>「唔！也没有話頭！缸裏没有米，竃下没有柴；都不管。薪水一領到手，就先得替老婆買扢繩襪，生怕把一個寳貝似的老婆凍壞了！……」母親怒氣冲冲地說。又輕歎了一聲。</p>
<p>「我想，凍總凍不壞人，没有飯吃才難過。你自己也不想想：一個月二三十塊錢，够什麽？現在百物昻貴，顧衣食都顧不週，還要去亂用。將來肚皮餓了，只有喝西北風！……」</p>
<p>母親看見兒子垂頭喪氣，語調似乎緩和了些。</p>
<p>年青的丈夫一陣陣的悔恨在心上奔騰，澎湃。心想：</p>
<p>「啊！母親！我怎不明瞭家中艱困的情形？我也知道這些錢應當買急需的應用品！可是，當我看見裏的脚凍得那樣厲害，連鞋子都不能穿：在這三冬的季候，還依然穿單線襪，我又怎能忍受？你想，一個人的皮層那能抗得住嚴寒？而且，這毛繩襪也並没有化去多少錢啦！」</p>
<p>然而，他却不敢這樣分辯；只讓它悶在肚内。</p>
<p>母親瞟了兒子一眼，右手支着頤；鼓着嘴巴；鼻孔裏哼了一聲。</p>
<p>「……唔！俗語說得好，「娘是路邊草」</p>
<p>，還是老婆好。」這樣的痛老婆！……</p>
<p>把娘就丢在屁股後。……母親喃喃自語着。</p>
<p>年青的丈夫斜睨了妻一眼，沉默着。妻也只是苦惱地凝視着地面。</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>屋裏充滿了不愉快的空氣。</p>
<p>年青的丈夫心裏似刀絞一般的難受，垂着頭。</p>

<p>— 繆崇羣</p>
<p>—一九三三年北國風景綫</p>
<p>靠近沙漠的地方，括起風來連天都是黄的。</p>
<p>駱駝默着煤塊，從門頭溝來。一個好駄幾百片，兩個就可以駄一噸多。用不着什麽載重汽車，反正運到城裏就變成了烟灰和碴子。</p>
<p>駱駝是成行成列的，在每個行列後頭，總是跟着一個小的；頸上掛着一個用洋烟罐子做的鈴鐺。聽見丁冬丁冬的聲音，就知道駱駝要過完了。</p>
<p>冬天，没有雪，春天過了也看不見什麽青草。踏不到沙漠，踏到的是比香爐裏還深的灰塵那些住在保衛界裏的外國人，他們看厭了皇宮，看厭了前門大街和ＭorrisonＳtreet上的古董，有時就跑上我們的城頭，帶着矮加發或珂達的照相機，把鏡頭對凖了一行一行的駱駝或散在街上的亂七八糟黄面皮的人一按，這古城圈裏的所謂風景便被他們攝取到了。</p>
<p>當地人不懂得什麽呌保衛界，就知道那有槍眼砲壘的地方是「西交民巷」。</p>
<p>西交民巷裏不但有青草，而且比什麽地方的都緑。樹也是特别的，一棵一棵全刷上了白灰，顯着那麽整齊而潔凈。</p>
<p>粟色短毛的洋狗，身上閃着庫緞一般的光亮。這光亮也就是他們主人的體面。他們的營養好，每天按規矩吃幾磅牛肉和餅乾。主人在大洋樓裏辦公，他們便在外邊蹓躂或逛逛，生活是非常安閑的。</p>
<p>天氣好的時候，呌他們眼睛有些發眯。在草地上或樹根底下，儘可以去嗅一些異性的氣息，這些都没有人管，只要他們樂意。</p>
<p>崗位上站的是中國人，穿着黄色的大清朝代的短筒靴子，手裏拿着一根短短的警棍。他也很清閑，看看草地，看看樹木，看看洋狗，看得出神的時候，就有些呆頭呆腦的樣子。</p>
<p>—明兒格關餉，他想，隂曆是五月初了，快過節了。</p>
<p>他把頭低了一會，不久又轉了一下，像是觸動了什麽心思。</p>
<p>輕輕地吹着口哨，</p>

<p>政府麥廠方有成交兩船說</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初定</p>
<p>繼跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、均續小二角左右不等、故初開時、人心己見平平、入後因傳政府麥廠方已有成交、一說二船、一說一船半、聞阜豐定一船、無錫九豐定半船、價均四元另三分、因此福新阜豐等廠、均大量抛售、價遂步步銳落、至各廠現貨、福新初喊二元另八分、後則跟阜豐照標凖直抽、迨至下午開盤、各月份市勢、略呈定勢、本月份因天津抽買頗力、聞全日有十餘萬包交易、逺期則洋麥如是鬆廉、多頭均無意再擯、價遂續跌、如六月份已至二元另三分七厘半、預測之二元大關、已相接近矣、結果本月份較跌二分、四月份跌二分七厘半、五月份跌二分半、六月份跌三分、七月份跌三分半、八月初開四分半、收價亦小二厘半、</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈平疲不前之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大均小二角左右、惟市塲人心、因近期幾月份、尚係陳貨、業中人因廠方尚有進胃、心思反定、逺其各月份、雖環境如是不佳、洋麥又步步鬆廉、不過最近春寒料峭、人心不無顧慮、抛户一稀、價呈定局、結果祗七月份較小二分、餘無比較、八月份己經做開、初價二元九角二分、後無變動、現麥市面、價趨平定、開山東麥三元四角半、瑶灣麥三元四角半、蚌埠麥三元三角半、計開一千包云、</p>

<h3 id="c283">自殺 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>在寫字檯上擺着的那組民國二十三年份的日曆；雖祇翻過了薄薄的五十多頁，—二個月還没有滿—然而，接着發生的自殺事件，倒己出了二十幾椿了，而且，多數是青年男女。考其自殺原因；不外經濟，戀愛，失學，尤其是最近的；胡眞，嚴秀娥，吳繼蘭，艾霞，和一個不知姓名無無名艶屍，竟轟動了一時。頓使這平風靜浪（？）的上海社會上：好像給她們投下了一塊巨石，激出了鱗鱗的微波！</p>
<p>艾霞，是電影明星，而且是天才　作家。吳繼蘭是名坤伶，對於文學也很有相當的修養。但是，她們二人的自殺！突然地自殺！直到現在還没有人明白倒底爲了什麽原因？經濟嗎？戀愛嗎？不—都不是的。那末爲了什麽呢？終於成了一個極大的疑問？</p>
<p>同樣的：艾霞和吳繼蘭都自殺了！可是艾霞就引起了很多人的注意，或者也可以說是同情。因爲她是文友，她是藝人，所以上海爲她出追悼專號的報紙，也已有五六家，還要勞駕幾位新聞記者先生：不辭跋涉的親自去訪問，當時幾張報紙上也用了皇皇的特號標題排着她自殺的新聞。據說：一般文藝界，還在替她籌備追悼會啦！吾想艾霞這一死倒也值得，倒也光榮。不概她自己到了九泉也要有「不虚此一死」之嘆吧！她的事跡，不平凡的事跡，也許不久會有大文學家給她編上書本，攝入銀幕呢！畢竟，不愧爲「現代一女性」，「時代的女兒」！</p>
<p>無名艶屍的死，是投身在淞滬路車軌上的，但，究竟是怎麽一回事？迄至今還不明向。胡眞的死；是爲了投考學校不錄取。這裏吾對於胡女士的自殺，雖不願說什麽，但，吾以爲女子的心地倒底太狹窄了。爲了投考不錄取，竟值得自殺！她這好學精神雖堪嘉佩！可是，不該走到消極途上去，所以，吾對於她那必死的决心，却不敢恭維！</p>
<p>講到嚴秀娥，她浪漫於前，悔悟於後，最後的遭際是，遇人不淑，致被遺棄。她也曾受過相當教育，而竟誤入歧途，現在雖然覺悟，但「一失足成千古恨，再回頭已百年身」！本來，現時代金錢，物質，聲色，的誘惑，是最容易使那些意志薄弱的青年女子墮落。像嚴秀娥者，大可以給時下一般摩登青年女子，作一個極好的殷鑒！</p>
<p>吾不是說句殘忍的話：她們的死是不足惜，誰呌她們好好的人不做，而偏生要去自尋苦惱呢？她們假使以這樣勇於赴死的精神，拿來爲本身事業去奮鬥！爲生命前途去掙扎！那麽，吾想最後的勝利，終屬於她們的。現在她們咎由自取，也不能够怨環境，更不能够怪社會，還有什麽話可說？</p>
<p>戀愛—是視之無物，嗅之無味的東西；值得什麽稀罕。但是它吞噬了不知幾許有志有爲的青年，把不少的人們都葬送在戀愛的墳墓裏。</p>
<p>經濟—它雖能支配人們的一切，但，吾相信，只要抱着同自殺一樣的勇概心，堅忍心去和它奮鬥，它也會有給吾們支配的時候。</p>
<p>因此，她們的死，無論是被人們認爲偉大或渺小，吾始終不能表同情的。吾只有爲她們惋惜她們死得太不值得，太没有意識。吾雖不反對死，但吾却主張就是死也得要死得有價值才，才對得住父母，對得住社會。不然無論如何總是國家的不幸，社會的損失！</p>
<p>自殺的潮流，又在澎湃了。雙服毒啦，單服毒啦，以後自殺的事件，也說不定正方興未艾呢！</p>
<p>當民國二十三年的幕序；剛剛展開來的時候，那觸目驚心的自殺事件，就接連着發生在大上海的社會層裏。這樣，吾想與其說今年是「婦女國貨年」，倒，倒不如說它是「××」自殺年」比較來得確切些，而且很是名符其實的！</p>
<h3 id="c284">無名劇人恊會二次公演觀後感 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>如以中國電相比較，無可否認的，舞臺劇的空氣，的確是冷寂得可怕。因此，當人們都十分迫切的希望從舞臺上得着充分的精神食糧的時候，卽使是小規模的公演，他使人感覺非常興奮。這一次無名劇人恊會第二次公演於陳英士紀念堂，在二月二十六日晚間我也抖擻精神的去看了一次。</p>
<p>據說，同劇社的第一次公演是在九崖大戲院。當時因爲不知道，没有去看，自然不知成績如何。然而這一次，雖然在技術上並没有給予我極好的印象，可是從意義方面說，却不能不使我們爲之驚嘆。</p>
<p>我們可以很肯定的說，無名劇社的同人們，從選擇劇本以至於在精神上所表現出來的，都證實了他們或她們都是緊隨着時代的巨浪而努力前進的健兒，他們或她們對於現社會已經有了深切的認識，他們深深的理解着，這舊有的腐爛的一切將必然的毁滅，他們在掙扎和苦門中熱烈的期望着光明的到來。因此，我在這裏對於無名劇人恊會諸君，懷着熱忱的敬意。</p>
<p>此外，我應當極善意的對於這一次公演呈獻一點個人的意見，當然這並不是批評。然而我祇看了晚塲，所寫的也僅限於「流浪者」，「兄弟」，「一百金磅」和「同住三家」四劇。同時我也不想每一個劇都分别的詳述，還是全般的說比較的方便一點。</p>
<p>在失業者日益增加，而又對他們没有保障或救濟的現在，「流浪者」從反面寫到社會的動亂和失業者的不安，自然是切合着現實的，同樣，在目前减房租的呼聲，已經普遍全上海的時候，「同住三家」的演出，自然更有意義了。此外，「兄弟」中寫着不同環境的兄弟所得着不同的遭遇，更展開了新倫理的矛盾關係。至於「一百金磅」，也許我們對於那個警察不關心於一百金鎊的賞格而將越獄犯放走，未免覺得生疎，然而革命戰士已博得廣大的同情，乃是最明顯而普遍的現象了。</p>
<p>在這四個獨幕劇中，自然每一個都有它單獨的主題存在，可是我們可不難找出一個共同點，那便是對於現實現象十分　合。社會的不安，被壓迫者的不幸的流血和積極的動亂，以及那必然勝利的前途。更顯然的是四個劇都有警察，他們的任務是不使「上面的跌了下來，下面的翻了上去」，可是他們在行動上所表現出來的却使人十分可笑了。</p>
<p>很明白的，這些戲不僅是在目前十分需要，而且是一般在苦悶中日夜掙扎着的觀衆，所竭識接受着的東西，因爲每一個劇都是補齋的原故。然而形式趕不上内容，不僅成爲中國電影最大的缺憾，而在舞臺表現得更爲明顯。</p>
<p>這自然是無可否認的，在演出技術上，無疑的不能滿足於觀衆的要求。假使我們爲了促進演劇技術之進步，我們不妨嚴格的提出一些所必需提出的意見。　　「流浪者」在舞臺面的構圖上，相當顯出了導演之成績。這自然是裝置的美化（雖然是不能更寫實一些。）燈光的柔和，使人得着相當程度的美感。而就人物的地位和情調的捉摩，都有適當的成功。這不僅是流浪者有着寛闊的地位可以做戲，更特别是李培爾律師和茶房始終站在階上不下來，並不教人討厭。劇的高潮雖然只借重於效果，而那「我們要麵包」的呼聲，到底是緊張得使人戰慄的。</p>
<p>同樣，「一百金磅」的導演，也見成功。特别是深夜的靜寂，從頭至尾没有鬆懈的把屋着，這决不是輕易可以做到的。可是没有利用適當的燈光將灰布化爲黑夜的天空或水面，乃是非常可惜的。特别是左面的角燈，和「兄弟」一樣，全不合理。假使說爲了帮助脚燈的不足，那我以爲是不必要的顧及。假使在貨箱旁邊有一盞冷清的路燈，不是旣可照明臉部而且增加不少情調嗎？何况Ｓpotilght給我們自由的使用。卽使看不見臉部表情，在這一劇中並不是何等重大的損失。我們想想罷，美麗的月亮，凄凉的路燈，幽靜的琴聲，假使再加上清脆的槳聲，蠕動的人物，幾乎變爲黑影，那是如何一種心境啊。然而我們的導演還不够把握。</p>
<p>其次應當說到「兄弟」了。這是一個十分嚴肅的悲劇。假使導演能犬膽的將監獄强調於黑暗的配光，除了臘燭之外，只有那自窗口或鐵門邊投進的微光，再加上鐵鍊聲，開閉牢門時的鎖聲，獄卒在窗外行走時可怕的脚步聲，未嘗不是詩的境地。然而莫明其妙的白光却會從地面上射來。在那未寛大的牢獄裏還有那末漂亮的椅桌，不管這是否爲外國的習慣，到底不能使人發生眞實感了。此外對於人物的處理；那個弟弟老是不相干的站着，哥哥也没有充分表現出悲苦激昻之機會，固然是演員能力不够，然而導演者並没有將演員活的使用，却是不可否認的事實。不過後面的燈光變換却還可取。</p>
<p>最後最糟的便是「同住三家」了。也許這因爲比較的人多，難於處理，同時又是中國劇，使我們更易於從自己的生活感情中看出劇的破綻。但是塲面是十足的呆笨，全無劇的旋律。諸如那個工人始終無事可做，其他各人都安排得不自然。特别是文明戲的氣氛，過於濃厚，更是最大的失敗。這自然是導演應該負着最大的責任。</p>
<p>現在我們應當在表演方面，簡單的說到一些。幾個劇的主角，都有相當的成績。金山君在「流浪者」中所飾的勞蕾，固然不够表現劇中人的兩重人格，但也不如何失敗。同劇中飾律師陶海君扮裝太糟。爲了戲劇的誇張而裝大肚皮這必然要適當的體格，然而以他瘦小的體格却完全失敗了。尼古老板和郵着都有相當可取。警察最壞。「兄弟」中飾弟弟的卽絮君太生疎，毫無經騐。飾安尼的沙白君還好，但還欠沉着。飾牧師的化裝甚佳，可惜說白不清。「一百金磅」中的魏鶴齡和王瑛二君，自然是所有的演員中比較最熟練的了。嚴格一點說，那末王瑛君的嗓音不够洪亮，魏鶴齡君没有表現出内心的矛盾，二警察又是太弱。「同住三家」的角色，都屬平平。沙白君扮裝老太婆，雖不見甚佳，到底還可過去。陳秋舫女士和胡麗女士都是大膽做戲的，但不純熟。卽絮君的阿明和康里君的醉鬼平平事，許地恭君還好，但台詞太不熟練。姚平君還不够使人對調中人憎惡。也明君生疎之極。至於競君君</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>的阿雲，上塲時到還可以，到後來却全部文明戲，應當是本劇中最失敗的一個。</p>
<p>如上所述，我們可找出一個共同的弱點，除了因經濟而設備不够充裕之外，排演不熟練，而怱怱忙忙的上演，乃是最主要的失敗退因。至於没有經過很好的彩排，在燈光或音響效果方面，自然不會有美滿成績了。因此，在業餘劇　之中，而又没有充裕的經費，不是很　　　良好的結果嗎？</p>
<p>但是我們爲了提高戲劇的技術水凖，爲了增高觀衆對於舞台劇的興趣，爲了完成新的形式以適合内容的要求，我們將何以努力改善我們的工作呢？我們要求自己的劇塲，我們要求經常訓練着的演員，我們要求以戲劇爲終身事業的拔術者。所以，我們應當以最大的努力來組織職業劇團，這是我們當前主要的任務。</p>
<h3 id="c285">青年的戀愛問題 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 守源</p>
<p>自從五四運動以後，新浪漫主義就隨着資本主義侵入這封建的中國，於是一般青年起來反抗舊家庭，封建勢力漸漸被資本主義的洪潮冲得動摇了，在這時候的青年拚命的向外掙扎，要想脫離封建家庭的束縛，對於一切的舊道德，舊禮教，舊思想，舊文學都是不滿的，急於尋求新思想，新文學；於是新浪漫主義的文學興起了！當然是正合青年的口味，中國從未有過的所謂「戀愛」也漸漸發生了！現在是更普遍了！</p>
<p>在現在這天災人禍，内憂外患下的中國，稍爲明白一點的人都感覺到國家，個人的没有出路，社會的黑暗；熱腸的青年當然也同樣的感覺到！意志不堅定的青年在他這樣感覺到的時候，而又没有勇氣在這惡劣的環境中奮鬥，找出路，他感到惡勢力的壓迫，而又没有勇氣反抗牠，只有悲哀和煩悶，於是消極了！在可以享樂的時候且享樂一下吧！過一日混一日，戀愛中去求點樂趣吧！把他的精力，時間完全耗費在戀愛上，虚僞的戀愛是要金錢來維持的，正當的職業所得的報酬當然不够花費，於是投降了惡勢力，做起了走狗！</p>
<p>戀愛至上主義的青年，當然更不消說是以戀愛爲生活的全部，只求自己的享樂，過去今日不知明日，雖然他們唱「神聖的愛是無條件的」！但他們絶不會去和窮小子談情說愛，必定是金錢爲標凖，要使他們的戀愛很幸福，那必定是要錢，於是也投降了惡勢力，做起了走狗！戀愛成了青年墮落唯一的途徑！</p>
<p>照上面看來，戀愛是青年墮落的根源，不是！戀愛並不是壞事，感情是人人有的，在相當的時期是可以戀愛的，不過我們不能以戀愛爲生活的全部，戀愛是人生活動中的一部份，而重要的却不在此，重要的是要鍜鍊自己，堅定我們的意志，感到惡勢力的壓迫，我們應當去反抗，我們感到没有辦法來對付這惡勢力，就是我們自己鍜鍊得不健全；所以我們要努力鍜鍊自己，把自己鍜鍊得健全了！那麽對於現實的問題就不會只是悲哀和煩悶而無法解决了！也不會因煩悶而消極，墮落了！</p>

<p>— 克心</p>
<p>貧　婦　（離牆站起來）……我不忍…看着你…在我懷裏…這機活活…餓…餓死……她垂着頭，哽咽着，向「收嬰處」掙扎去。走進了那裏時，她已支持不着，一手扶在那個抽屜近的的牆上。歇一會兒，她支起來，望着那個怪物似的抽屜，伸出那隻越來越見顫動的手，想去抽開那抽屜。剛一接觸到，她就觸電似的忙縮回來；緊緊地抱着嬰孩，生怕她的寳貝被吸去或傷害了似的。北過身來側倚着牆。</p>
<p>這時寒漸起，雪花也漸下得密。她爲她的寳貝遮風當雪，無奈風總向她身上襲，雪總向她身上集。自己却凍得只是發抖，抵當不着。　　貧婦（取下她的頭巾來蓋在嬰孩頭部，）我不能……讓你這樣……凍死……在我……懷裏……</p>
<p>抖着又轉過身來，怯怯地靠近那抽屜。正要伸手去開……</p>
<p>嬰孩呱，呱，呱……</p>
<p>貧女忙縮回手來，一下靠在牆上，頭伏在手上，背向着觀衆。她咽泣着，雙肩隨着嬰孩的哭聲聳動。</p>
<p>嬰孩的哭聲漸弱下去了，終于停止了。這時風更大，雪更密了。貧婦，並不轉過身來，緊張而顫動地伸出手去摸索那抽屜。她摸索到了那抽屜絆，就一下抓緊，讓手急烈地在那裏抖顫了一會，那抽屜慢慢地抽開了。她仍緊緊地，顫動地，抓着那絆子，漸漸轉過身來，望着那抽屜。望着望着，那抽屜彷彿變成了一個可怕的怪物的血口似的，她趕忙一下關上。緊緊地抱着她的孩子。</p>
<p>貧婦我不能，我不能……</p>
<p>離開抽屜，想往走回去：可是她那雙沉重的脚比來時更見沉重越走越難拖動，終于停下了。</p>
<p>貧婦回去…回去…拿什麽來養……寳寳，你要活，你不能；將來有緣，我們還…寳寳，我不是抛棄你…這不能埋怨我，寳寳……寳寳……</p>
<p>邊說邊走向抽屜那裏去。一面伸手開抽屜，一面就熱烈地吻那嬰孩，咽泣着，呌着，一直到她把那嬰孩放進抽屜裏還不停止。</p>
<p>貧婦（臉離開了嬰孩）寳寳，寳寳……</p>
<p>嗚咽着，呌着，遲遲地推着那抽屜。終于一下關上了。她伏在那裏嗚咽得更厲害了。</p>

<p>嬰孩的哭聲漸漸逺去。</p>
<p>貧婦（急忙醒過來，抽開抽屜，見是空的，就急切地）寳寳；寳寳……</p>

<h3 id="c287">「墨西哥的暴風雨」 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 許幸之</p>
<p>（一）攝製的經過和糾紛</p>
<p>逺在一九三０年，愛森斯坦（ＳergeiＥisenstein）在巴黎試作他最初的聲片的時候，剛巧遇着了派拉蒙公司的杜加，杜加因爲羨慕他的名望，當卽要求他到好萊塢去攝製影片。愛森斯坦回國後，便把這問題提出討論了，得到國人同意的愛森斯坦，帶了在「内容」和「主題」上絶對不能讓步的使命，來到好萊塢參加派拉蒙公司的製片了。最初愛森斯坦所提出的兩三種劇本，無論如何也不合派拉蒙公司製片家們的口味，後來，以「美國的悲劇」而得到杜加的同意開始攝影了，不幸又遭了當局以「絶對不許攝製」的命令，而又停止了。</p>
<p>可是，在友人辛克萊（ＵptonＳinciair）的援助之下，愛森斯坦又開始新的工作，這就是有名的，捲起了全世界影壇之波瀾的「墨西哥的暴風雨」（ThunderＯverＭexico）了。這新的工作由愛森斯坦導演，亞歷山特羅夫（ＦＧＡlexanderov）編劇，蒂塞（ＥduardＴisse）攝影的合作，從一九三一年到一九三二年，花費了十一個月的時間，使用了二十萬呎的底片，全部分爲五篇，以墨西哥的過去，現在，未來爲題材，作成了墨西哥歷史的叙事詩。可是，一方面因爲辛克萊的金盡而中途引退，他方面因爲愛森斯坦有事歸國，便把全部的底片殘剩在影人雜沓的好萊塢了。然而，投機家的辛克萊，爲了商賣上的便宜，便從那二十萬呎的底片中，剪接了七千呎的底片，選取原作品不足五分之一的材料，巧妙地利用了愛森斯坦的名字，在一九三三年的電影市塲上公然發賣了。</p>
<p>因此，在影城的美國所引起的糾紛和反響，也正和那題名相吻合地捲起了莫大的狂嵐。先是理解的電影從業員和批評家們開始提出抗議，如在墨西哥的愛森斯坦的崇拜者羅弗也是有力的一員。繼着支持這個運動的，有美國「實騐電影」（ＥxperinentalＣinerna）雜誌的同人，組織了「愛森斯坦墨西哥電影恊議會」，他們以爲「墨西哥的暴風雨」，是毁壞了愛森斯坦名譽的俗惡的電影，而提起禁止公映的運動。接着是「特寫」（Ｃioseup）雜誌的六·九月號發表了宣言，擁護愛森斯坦在墨西哥攝製的電影。他們聲明了如果不是愛森斯坦親手剪接的作品，就不得稱爲完成的影片，而提出了將全部的底片返還於愛森斯坦的運動。其後如有名的影評家彭德和勃萊弗孟等也捲入這事件的漩渦。特别是去年的七月五日辛克萊更發表關於「墨西哥暴風雨」的聲明書，說「這是依從了愛森斯坦的意思編輯出來的東西」。此後又發見了許多的言論和團體，并且出現了愛森斯坦的專門研究家。據最近的傳說，辛克萊爲了這部片子幾頻於破產，同時愛森斯坦爲了自己的名譽，將要對辛克萊提起法律的訴訟。因此，這影片所引起的影界的波瀾格外混亂而愈加擴大了。</p>

<h3 id="c288">評「藝人韻事」ＨisＤoubleＬitt—大光明 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在這虚僞的偶像崇拜的社會中，以藝術家之敏銳的感覺，其最切身感受的，便是自身作品之被人誤解甚至於給以不正確的估價，這在藝人們認爲是最大的痛苦。在他們眼中，一般愚昧的鑒賞者，並一定理解藝術的眞價。然而當少數藝術家成名之後，於是他的作品將被人們認爲無價之寳。就在這時候，奸詐的商人，從中取利，以其一知半解，妄加批判，於是藝術便成爲商品，而藝術家從此苦矣。</p>
<p>關於這類似的藝術作品，我們在小說或戲劇中眞不知讀了多少。前不久開映的「情郎心香」也就是針對着這種情形而笑駡的。而這以小說改編的，「藝人韻事」更是痛快的護駡了。</p>
<p>我想這是用不着再加解釋的，一個名畫家之僕人的死，可以被悞爲畫家之死而驚動全國，而其畫家却受盡了人們之嘲笑，甚至於被警察當作瘋人而驅逐。同樣藝術商人們居然大胆的利用畫家之名而大賺其錢。怪事重重笑話疊出。於是純良率直的畫家在傷心之餘而認定愚昧與奸詐的人們，都戴着可恥的假面具，自身是無理由的被人們玩弄了。</p>
<p>如上所述的取材，我們不能不爲之感動。然而在演出技巧上却顯得非常平庸。假使更苛刻一點，那末簡直是除了一些幽默的對白之外，毫無可取。</p>
<p>當然我們是說以美國的電影技術，應當更成功一些。但是導演除了叙述了這一離奇曲折的故事之外，並没有將故事更强調的戲劇化起來。我們只看到勞萊楊頗有做戲的地方，而居於女主角之地位的麗琳格舒，簡直就無戲可做。全篇是沉悶，晦澀，有如梅雨天氣，使人軟綿綿的煩悶欲死。也許我們不會忽視其中簡潔的手法，如愛麗絲和佛雷的開始同居，僅僅是互相說了一句「Ｉdo」便告了結，然而當愛麗絲和黎克之妻子見面時，却是圍坐在桌子旁長長的對話。幸而常以可笑的詞句相當調和了晦澀的空氣。當黎克母子去後，佛雷自濃重的夜霧中走進屋裏的塲面那個畫面是很好看的。以後洗脚的一塲，那和藹的家庭之素描，亦很可取。再佛雷眼中之各人臉上之假面具，該是本片用意最深之處。可是法庭中有些地方歌劇化，却與全篇之寫實筆調甚不調和。</p>
<p>此外還有什麽好說呢？麗琳格舒給與了中國觀衆最悲痛的印象，因之她所主演的葛雷菲斯的名作「賴婚」曾經配音，而她的名字在中國亦頗可號召。然而往日的光榮到底隨着她的年華逝去。在這裏，她雖然是少女的扮裝，可是在她的動作和表情中終於掩飾不了那固有的暮氣。不過以演悲劇見長的她，爲什麽在重登銀幕之初而飾這不哭不笑的角色呢？她固然是賢妻良母的典型的角色，但可惜在這裏全未發揮。我想這應當是導演的失責。相反的素以歪角色見長的勞萊楊，在此飾一忠厚馴善的畫家，却得着相當的成功。</p>

<p>— 杜明</p>
<p>（一）明星公司鄭正秋導演之有聲片「姊妹花」，自廢歷除夕放映至今，無日不告客滿；統計觀衆，將近十萬，以上海全市三百萬市民計算：平均每卅人中卽有一人看過「姊妹花，」其賣座之盛，簡直昏天黑地，至打破一切中外影片賣座紀錄，自屬毫無問題矣。</p>
<p>（二）鄭正秋君已决定本年度導演三片：第一部爲姚蘇鳳君編劇之「路柳墻花」（有聲，）第二部爲重拍明星公司曾經哄動一時之「空谷蘭，」（「空谷蘭」原爲二部，改攝一部；原爲默片，）改攝聲片。）第三部爲蘇曼殊小說「斷鴻零雁記」改編電影。關於「斷鴻零雁記」改編一事，曼殊友人柳亞子先生已在本報「自由談」中，與鄭正秋先生公開討論。預料該三片成績，必可哄動。</p>
<p>（三）程步高君自完成其自編自導。新作「同仇」（王瑩，嚴月閒，陳凝秋主演。）「華山艶史」（徐來·龔稼農·陳凝秋·主演。）兩片以後，卽着手籌備其下一部作品「到西北去」，該劇去年曾在隴海路取外景，劇本極爲程君所重視</p>
<p>（四）「華山艶史」將繼「姊妹花」後在新光問世。該片背景，取自華山，景色清絶；故事極富詩意，導演確可當「秀麗玲瓏，花轉錦簇」二語</p>
<p>（五）徐欣夫君導演，胡蝶，王徵信，顧梅君等主演之「白山黑水美人心」，工作極爲努力，現已攝製過半。</p>
<p>（六）李萍倩君自売成艾霞，高倩蘋主演之「黄金榖」及「時代的兒女」以後，下一部片卽導演「三姊妹，」由蝴蝶·嚴月閒·孫敏·趙丹等主演，該片情感豐富，故事曲折，公司中人預料將來必定賣錢。</p>
<p>（七）「女性的仇敵」，爲陳鏗然·徐琴芳夫婦再度合作之片，現將攝竣。陳君導演該片，頗費心力。</p>
<p>（八）沈西苓以「上海廿四小時」一片，成績驚人，頗爲電影側目。現其半月來埋頭編製之新劇本「煙，」不日卽可告竣，開始上塲（攝影塲也）工作。</p>

<p>陸元甫在高彥暗示下，摸出手槍，預備槍斃林振霄了。—他曾跑近振霄，替他把手帕遮没眼睛。</p>
<p>雪娟是狂跳了，像在油鍋裏煎着的鯉魚，像……「砰！」槍聲作響的當兒，雪娟倒進了高彥的懷裏，她暈了。</p>
<p>高彥覺得勝利了！笑了！——那笑是太難看啦！</p>

<p>雪娟發現了桌上的手槍，立刻上前搶它過來，憤憤地，拔，拔，……啊！</p>
<p>彈没有！那邊廂的高彥看着她笑了！</p>

<p>Concentrated Between Linhe and Dengkou</p>
<p>Sun Intends to Counterattack Again</p>
<p>It is Reported that Fu Zuoyi Arrived in Guihua and Will Inspect Baotou</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi's associate, Men Bingyue, arrived in Guihua at 4:00 PM today. Fu is expected to convene a meeting with Wang Jingguo and others to discuss and determine the equitable distribution of the military funds received from the branch. Fu will inspect the military situation at the front in Baotou next week once everything is settled and then advance further. It is uncertain whether Fu Zhanqui and the two representatives from Zhang and Wang can persuade Sun Dianying to leave the army, according to authorities and all parties. Xu Yongchang plans to return to Jin province in two or three days to report his visit to Ping to Yan Xishan. Yan is still staying in Hebian Village due to his father's unresolved illness. Commerce in Jin province has been on the verge of bankruptcy in recent years, with a monthly reduction of about 700,000 yuan in revenue. Military expenses have also exceeded the budget, and a decision will be made in the future to implement troop reductions and reduce military expenses. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Sub-Committee announced Ma Hongbin's telegram on the evening of the 1st: (1) The enemy north of Ningyuan launched another counterattack on our entire line at 未時 (between 1 and 3 PM) on the 23rd, launching a fierce attack on our positions near Beita with the support of concentrated artillery fire. Our army bravely fought back, charging several times. The enemy was extremely fierce and stubborn. Although they suffered heavy losses and were repeatedly defeated, they quickly returned to fight to the death. Our army rallied its spirits and continued to engage the enemy in close combat, killing about five or six hundred enemy soldiers. After more than eight hours of fighting, the enemy retreated. (2) The enemy troops appear to be preparing for another counterattack and are equipped with several armored vehicles to assist in the battle. Our army is calmly preparing. (3) The enemy fire in Pingluo burned the Nanguan Niuwang Temple in an attempt to disrupt morale. Our 口旅 (unit name unclear) is on high alert, and the enemy has not succeeded. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong stated that Sun Dianying's troops dare not advance further west because Gansu is sparsely populated and supplies are difficult. When Wu Ziyu passed through Gansu in the past, he led a thousand men through various places and still had to arrange food and drink in advance. If Sun's army of tens of thousands were to continue advancing, internal changes might occur. Sun himself has realized this, so he is willing to have the Military Sub-Committee send someone to negotiate. Fu Shuangying will go soon. If Sun hands over military power and retires, he will reside in Taiyuan, where he has a lot of property and houses. Yu also said that rumors circulating abroad that he and so-and-so are being transferred are false. This is because someone is spreading rumors with ulterior motives. He will do his duty as long as he is in office, and he is determined to complete any official duties as soon as possible and never delay or wait and see. Even if the central government issues an order for his removal or transfer tomorrow, today's matters must also be handled clearly. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Before Fu Zhanqui arrives in Dengkou to resolve the issue of Sun's troops, military steps will continue to be advanced according to the planned plan. The Jin-Sui army is concentrated between Linhe and Dengkou, waiting for an opportunity to advance westward. Li Ming, the liaison staff sent by He Yingqin, has arrived in Baotou. In addition to the three units of Fu Zuoyi, Wang Jingguo, and Zhao Chengzhou of the Jin-Sui army, which have already departed for western Sui, the reserve team, the 3rd Brigade of Feng Yuxi's unit, set out from Datong this morning to take over the defense of the Baotou area. The Wang Shitian Shumei Brigade stationed in Baotou will also advance towards Linhe within days after receiving supplies and transportation expenses. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Troop Numbers Exceed the Provisions of the Boxer Protocol</p>
<p>(Beiping) More than 1,000 Japanese garrison troops in North China took a special train on the Beining line to Tangguantun in southern Tianjin on the 1st to conduct large-scale exercises. The area or troop numbers all exceeded the provisions of the Boxer Protocol. The usual 300 or so troops also went to Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 1st, reportedly to participate in the exercises. (1st Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than 800 Japanese soldiers, about one regiment, led by Nakamura, left Tianjin at 7:00 AM on the 1st along the Jinpu Line to Liangwangzhuang, Guantun, Jinghai, and other areas for exercises, scheduled for four days, from the 1st to the 4th. Horses, military equipment, supplies, and a portion of the soldiers were transported by train after requesting cars from the Jinpu Railway Bureau. When the Japanese side notified the Hebei Provincial Government of the exercise matters on the same day, the provincial government politely refused on the grounds that the matter involved cross-border exercises, but it did not take effect, and the cars were dispatched to transport the Japanese soldiers to the exercise location. The Jinpu Railway authorities also faced serious difficulties in dealing with this and struggled to cope. (1st Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Case of Reforming the Party System Requires Detailed Study <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain news agency, party headquarters in various provinces of North China and Jiangsu Province have successively suggested to the central government to restore the organizational system of the party to the "Leader System" (總理制) and to support a certain Central Committee member as the leader. According to another Central Committee member, the committee system is indeed very appropriate, avoiding the suspicion of dictatorship and collecting ideas widely. However, due to the large number of people, each other's balance, and every meeting, there are many speeches, and if there are differences of opinion, the whole case is put on hold, so those who criticize the party have the saying that "deliberations are not decided, and decisions are not implemented," and the party also self-deprecates it. Recently, the party headquarters in various provinces, in view of the urgent national crisis, feel that it is difficult to achieve domestic peace and foreign resistance and save the crisis without centralized power. The central government naturally has the same feeling. Because the party is a political group, talking about politics cannot be separated from the conditions of time and space. Therefore, the committee system is suitable for that time but may not be suitable for today. After changing to the "Leader System," the committee members can still coexist and assist the leader, but the leader has the power to make all decisions. In this way, it is hoped that those responsible can move forward bravely and reduce resistance. However, reforming the party system should not be done rashly, and it will be submitted to the central government for detailed study and then submitted to the National Congress for discussion. According to my observation, this kind of reform can be realized because it adapts to the needs of the environment. As for the emergence of the leader, it should be elected by the National Congress.

<p>Party Members Should Absolutely Abide by the Party Constitution and Discipline</p>
<p>It is Said that Changing to the "Leader System" is Not Worth a Wise Man's Smile</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with reporters from the Central News Agency tonight and said the following: Recently, there have been rumors that the party will change to the "Leader System," and there is a saying that the central government is pushing me to be the leader, which is not worth a wise man's smile. Since we are party members, we should absolutely abide by the party constitution and obey the party discipline, which cannot be changed by one or two people, nor can it be violated by anyone. This rumor will be disproved by itself. Moreover, I often think that the success or failure of the revolution does not lie in how the system is changed, but in how the doctrine is realized. If the current dictatorship of Germany and Italy is successful, and the party also imitates the dictatorship, then the party imitated the collective system of the Soviet Union in the past, and the revolution of the party should have succeeded long ago. Why is it that it has failed until now? In short, it is up to people to make things happen. If the party leaders can be united, reform themselves, then even if they fail, they can succeed. Otherwise, if they engage in intrigue, spread rumors, and cause trouble, fearing that the world will not be chaotic and that foreign insults will not arrive, then if they imitate others badly, no matter whether the system is collective or dictatorial, there is no one who will not fail, and the Chinese environment and facts are not comparable to those of Germany and Italy today.

<p>Our Country's Attitude Towards Puppets Has Always Been the Same</p>
<p>The Non-Recognition of European and American Countries Has Also Become an Iron Law</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang, who also serves as the Foreign Minister, made the following statement on the matter of the puppet Puyi's usurpation of the throne on the 1st: The matter of Puyi's usurpation of the throne has been rumored for a long time, and the people of the whole country are indignant at this kind of treasonous behavior. However, from our observation, the three northeastern provinces and Rehe have always been in a state of military occupation, and Puyi and others have always been puppets manipulated by others, without independent personalities. No matter whether their title is "Executive" or "Emperor," or their form is democratic or imperial, it is just that the role they play has changed, but the essence of the puppet remains unchanged. There is really no need to be surprised. In short, our country's attitude towards puppet states has always been the same and will never change slightly due to the form of the puppet. At the same time, the non-recognition of puppet organizations by European and American countries has also become an iron law of international morality, and there will never be any discrepancies before and after the puppet becomes emperor. If there is any violation of this iron law, it will damage the personality of the country. It can be asserted that what is regrettable is that the seriousness of the Far East issue may become more profound as a result, and the international disputes in the Far East will become more complex as a result. This is tantamount to increasing the world's unease, and its responsibility is self-evident. (1st Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">The Puppet Takes the Stage <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Puyi re-enacted taking the stage yesterday, implementing his usurpation. The Japanese even celebrated everywhere, calling it a new fact in East Asia. On the surface, this fabrication is clearly orchestrated and directed by the Japanese military, embodied by the Commander of the Kwantung Army, the Governor of Kwantung Leased Territory, and the Ambassador, who are one and the same. The events are evident and need no further elaboration. However, they still want to make every effort to create public opinion, with lackeys running around, forcing people to sign their agreement and buying people to submit letters of encouragement in order to call for Puyi's usurpation. We cannot but re-analyze this and gain a further understanding in order to expose the conspiracy of Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>First, the establishment of the Manchurian puppet is known to the world and it is not that the local people wanted to secede from the Republic of China. To this day, the 30 million people of the Northeast are still groaning under the oppressive rule. They not only have no goodwill towards it, but their hostility is getting deeper. However, under the trampling of iron hooves, they cannot resist. In the past two years, the establishment of the regime in the three northeastern provinces has nothing to do with the people of the Northeast. Even those who are nominally responsible in politics are only being used. In fact, the number of Japanese troops stationed in the Northeast is over 150,000. They want to use this force to hold Puyi as a puppet in order to implement their annexation policy. There is no concealment. Furthermore, the so-called "Chiefs" and "Presidents" in the Changchun puppet government are nominally held by Chinese traitors, but the real power is in the hands of Japanese officials with dual nationalities. It is estimated that the number of Japanese officials is approaching 1,500. Moreover, Japanese officials are also spread all over the counties, townships, and towns. The so-called "Jing'an Teams" and other troops formed by local people are all trained by Japanese. The highest command and the actual command at the lowest level are all the work of Japanese reserve soldiers operating under the jurisdiction of the Kwantung Army Staff Headquarters. Even the police in cities and villages are directed by Japanese police. This is further ironclad evidence that the Japanese are implementing an annexation policy. When the Lytton Commission investigated the situation in the Northeast, the Japanese arrangement was not as meticulous as it is today. But it has already determined that the September 18th Incident was a pre-planned conspiracy by the Japanese army. As for today, we should more accurately recognize the urgency of their conspiracy and the seriousness of the Northeast issue, which is even greater than in the past.</p>
<p>Second, Puyi is already a puppet, and the people of the Northeast are already being slaughtered, so what is the reason for the Japanese to put on this second facade? The Japanese know very well that the 30 million people in the Northeast have not reconciled to surrender. Although they are temporarily limited by the environment, it is difficult to fight head-on. However, they have never forgotten their hatred for Japan. At the same time, they are also deeply aware that the capitalist organization has reached the mature stage, and the internal contradictions in Japan are particularly obvious. Therefore, they cannot but make a final struggle to call for the unification of the economy between Japan and Manchukuo. Recently, the armed immigration has failed, and the method of direct exploitation of farmers has followed. The investigation of livestock in rural areas. The investigation of vehicles. The clearing of land. Even a chicken or a dog must be registered. If something happens one day, it can be taken according to the table. The entire national economy of the Northeast is under their control. Furthermore, Japan's foreign war is most likely to be with the Soviet Union. Even if it is currently restrained by the economic panic, it may not dare to provoke it lightly. However, after a few more days, armed struggle will inevitably be inevitable. Therefore, the current intention of the Japanese army is not limited to annexing the Northeast. They intend to have Puyi usurp the throne in order to extend their demonic hands to Inner Mongolia, draw a large arc to surround Siberia, and spy on North China. We must have a serious alert to this.</p>
<p>Although Japanese diplomacy has superficially changed from its previous blind ignorance to moderate compromise, it has not changed its essence. Or it can be called a further step. Its intention is nothing more than to reconcile conflicts externally and eliminate deterioration in order to find a way out in the international community. If a way out is found, there will be a way to carry out its consistent policy. If it cannot be found, it will not hesitate to take risks and work hard as a gamble. The current temporary peace is only a temporary pause while seeking a way out. It can be known that the current crisis and future troubles are still being fiercely brewed. Therefore, it is also acceptable to say that Puyi's usurpation is a move by the Japanese to test the great powers.</p>

<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph criticized Puyi's ascension to the throne today, saying that although the British government does not recognize Manchukuo, the British secretly wish Puyi to remain in his position for a long time, because the fate of "Manchukuo" continues to be controlled by politicians in Tokyo. Japan's premeditation is not a policy of one day. It is only concerned with the interests of Japan. Whether Puyi becomes emperor or not has no important international relationship. As for the so-called will of heaven, it is nothing but self-deception. In fact, those who can be noble or humble are the wishes of Japan. (1st Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>

However, from a factual point of view, Japan seems to be doing its best to consolidate the territory it conquered by force by peaceful means.

Premier Wang recited the entirety of the provisions and their meaning, and also sought opinions from the representatives. Mr. Ni, the Chief Administrator representing Inner Mongolia, stated that all representatives accepted the eight principles of the Central Political Council and thanked the Central Government for its kindness on behalf of all Mongolians. He further stated that the representatives' petition to the capital had achieved its intended goals and they were eager to return to Mongolia to report and begin organizing the autonomous region government. However, the organizational regulations and detailed procedures for the autonomous government still awaited approval from the Legislative Yuan, which would take two weeks or more due to procedural reasons. They hoped that the Central Government would first promulgate the Provisional Regulations for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Government, so that the representatives could bring these provisional regulations back to Mongolia early. Premier Wang agreed to this, saying that they could be promulgated by the middle of next week. After the representatives took their leave, they also met with Shi Qingyang, Chen Lifu, Ye Chucang, Zhu Peide, Huang Musong, He Yaozu, and others to express their gratitude. They are scheduled to return to Mongolia next week. Regarding the location for the establishment of the Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Committee, the majority opinion is that Bailingmiao is the most suitable. The candidates for the committee members will be nominated by the leagues and banners and submitted to the Executive Yuan for forwarding to the Central Government for appointment. As for the Central Government sending a senior official to reside at the committee's location for guidance, Premier Wang stated that the selection of the person was already under consideration.

According to reports, the handover of Gubeikou was postponed for four days due to Puyi's usurpation of the title, and it is scheduled that he will go to Gubeikou with Huo Shi again on the 3rd to handle the handover. The fake police stationed at Nantianmen can be withdrawn four days ago, and the handover procedures have also been agreed upon and are not a problem. He returned to Beiping because Huang Zheng was ill and he was unable to pay his respects, so he presented a written report to Huang, reporting the details of the handover postponement, and also telegraphed Xue Zhong, reporting that the original quota of the Yutian Security Team was 1,000 people and it was decided to reorganize according to 1,000 people. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng suggested to the War Zone Relief Committee regarding the reorganization of long-distance telephone lines in the war zone that funds be allocated from the labor relief project for renovation. It is estimated that 12,000 yuan would be needed for the trunk and branch lines from Gaoliying to Gubeikou, Jixian to Yutian, and from Shimen Town to Malanlue. The Hebei Construction Department is currently bidding for materials, and workers will be dispatched to carry out the project as soon as the materials are transported to Beiping. It is planned to dispatch 30 workers to the Pingbei Road and 20 to the Pingdong Road, and they can repair 20 li per day. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>

The five small passes near Gubeikou, the three passes in the west being Baimaguan, Shitanglu, and Dashuilu, have mostly been evacuated by the Japanese army and there is no problem with the handover. The two passes in the east, Caojialu and Gengziyin, border Rehe, and bandits often sneak in from Wukou, harassing the people in the war zone. Currently, a small detachment of Japanese and puppet troops are stationed there. After the above passes are handed over, negotiations will be held with the Japanese side for our side to send security teams to guard them. The Japanese side has also agreed to the handover of Malanlue, and there should be no changes.

<p>France Announces National Defense Enhancement Plan</p>
<p>(Paris) After Eden held extremely friendly talks with French Prime Minister Doumergue and Foreign Minister Barthou today, hopes for disarmament were revived. According to a French government press release this afternoon, the French cabinet members told Eden during the talks that they would continue to study the British disarmament memorandum and would notify him of the government's decision within a few days. (1st Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Eden arrived here today with his new disarmament proposals, while France's plan to expand its national defense was announced at this time, causing a major blow to disarmament. Eden is scheduled to visit French Foreign Minister Barthou tomorrow, and is also expected to meet with French Prime Minister Doumergue. It is currently expected that Eden will present the Anglo-Italian-German joint disarmament proposals. All sectors of France have heard that Eden has reached an agreement with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Chancellor Hitler on a mediation plan, allowing Germany to increase its armaments without effective management or any guarantees, and are quite dissatisfied. It is expected that Foreign Minister Barthou will tell Eden that France's attitude remains unchanged, and Eden's investigative tour has failed to move closer to a solution to the disarmament issue. The French government does not want to entrust the nation's security to utopian international conventions, as evidenced by the new bill to strengthen national defense currently submitted to Congress. One of the bills stipulates the extension of the defensive engineering line to connect with the Belgian defense line to the sea. Another bill stipulates the construction of military aircraft according to a grand program. There is also a case stipulating the construction of one cruiser, one destroyer, and two submarines. This plan is expected to be passed by Congress before Easter. (28th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The defensive belt built by the French government on the Franco-German border has long been known for its impregnability. According to the Paris Times, all steel and concrete parts of the defensive buildings will be repaired and widened, making them even more solid. It is said that a duplicate line will soon begin to be built behind the existing defensive line from the Saar region to Strasbourg, and another longer second line will be built along the Franco-Belgian border, forming three parallel lines with the existing dense and continuous underground fortifications and so-called "magazine arrays".

<p>Violent Demonstrations in Tyrol Province</p>
<p>Police Arrest National Socialists in Large Numbers</p>
<p>Vienna: With the expiration of Habicht's ultimatum, violent National Socialist demonstrations broke out in Innsbruck, the capital of Tyrol province, after dusk. The 6,000-foot-high Lauterkeit mountain, which controls Innsbruck, had a huge swastika fire burning on its summit. At the same time, smoke bombs were thrown everywhere, and a real bomb was thrown, causing great damage to a famous painted glass shop in Innsbruck. The police arrested many people and ordered that for every smoke bomb thrown, two National Socialists would be arrested in retaliation. There were no demonstrations along the border between Vienna and Austria, and only occasional smoke bombs were thrown elsewhere. Some say that Habicht's ultimatum has been extended, so the National Socialists are not immediately active. Others say that German Chancellor Hitler and Habicht have conflicting opinions because Hitler feels that Habicht is putting too much pressure on Austria. News from Carinthia, Styria, and Tyrol provinces is that after the previous disturbances, the reputation of Prime Minister Dollfuss has greatly increased. It is said that many of the National Socialists in these three provinces, who are the most powerful in Austria, have now joined the government's "Patriotic Front". (28th Day Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>No Treaty Can Prohibit</p>
<p>Only the Ambassadorial Conference Declaration</p>
<p>(Paris) Today's newspapers commented on the issue of the restoration of the Austrian royal family, saying that if Austria were to restore the monarchy, there would be no international treaty that could prohibit it. However, there is the so-called Declaration of the Ambassadorial Conference in 1921, which stipulates that when the political system changes, the representatives of the signatory countries participating in the conference must first agree. Therefore, international interference can only follow this path. As far as France is concerned, according to the opinion of Foreign Minister Barthou, his opposition to the Austrian restoration is the same as his opposition to the Austro-German union. In any case, France should do everything possible to maintain Austria's economic and political independence, even if it has to use extreme economic pressure. (28th Day National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) President Hindenburg hosted a banquet for the King of Bulgaria last night, with Chancellor Hitler in attendance. (1st Day National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Sofia: The Bulgarian newspapers all say that the King's sudden visit to Germany has surprised everyone. The Slavo newspaper said that Bulgarian public opinion is very surprised by the King's visit to Germany and fears that it is not solely for international courtesy. In the past, various countries were surrounded by German conspiracies and felt very painful. Now, the situation has reversed and Germany has become the darling of Europe. However, in any case, Bulgaria and Germany were like brothers in the World War, sharing life and death and trusting each other, and the economic relations between the two countries are particularly close. Therefore, the Bulgarian people deeply approve of their King expressing his enthusiasm for Germany to the German people and President Hindenburg, who is highly respected in Germany, at this time. According to the Menhua A newspaper, the King's visit to Germany is not only because the two countries fought side by side for many years, but also because they suffered together from the hardships of the peace treaty at the end of the war, and the cultural and economic ties between the two countries are closely related. Bulgaria's economic future depends on the center of Europe, and Germany is most closely related to it. (1st Day National Telegram)</p>

<p>Understanding the Truth of the New Germany</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the German government took an extremely important step to contact foreign newspapers. Important cabinet members, including Vice Chancellor Papen, Foreign Minister Neurath, and Propaganda Minister Goebbels, invited representatives of foreign newspapers and the entire diplomatic corps to hold an informal get-together at the Propaganda Ministry. Goebbels took the opportunity to appeal in earnest for the promotion of world peace and begged foreign reporters to note that they have the responsibility of eliminating international isolation, saying that what we want is for foreign countries to further understand the new Germany and the intellectual forces that created the new Germany. All unresolved problems should be discussed openly and frankly, and the opinions of the opposing side should be respected. Germany has been despised by European countries for fourteen years. Since the National Socialist revolution, the situation has changed. Today, those in power are a new group of people whose will is to find ways to solve various problems. When old methods are ineffective, new methods should be used to solve them. Germany is willing to restore everything that has been destroyed by peace. Lochner, chairman of the Foreign Press Association, humbly thanked the German government for restoring relations with the foreign press, and said that the foreign press is willing to grasp the hand extended by the German government in the same spirit, but also hopes that the German government can understand the human and operational difficulties faced by foreign press representatives.

The hundred members of the Citizens' Action Party, on which Premier Leroux relied, suddenly announced that they would no longer support Leroux, so the government resigned today. The labor sector now fears that a strong anti-reform government will follow, so it has prepared to resist legislation unfavorable to labor.

<p>Madrid: The Republican Radical Party cabinet of Prime Minister Leroux resigned en masse this morning due to internal political disagreements.

Even students have repeatedly caused disturbances in the two and a half months since Leroux took office. President Zamora immediately summoned the leaders of various political parties to discuss the issue of new prime minister candidates. At the same time, various rumors of revolution are circulating in the capital. Leroux formed a cabinet on December 15 of last year.

<p>(Paris) The 1934 budget has been passed by both houses of parliament in its first reading. However, the provisions voted on by the two houses are not entirely consistent, so the two houses held an all-night meeting last night to conduct a final study of the budget. The discussions were purely technical and did not involve any political enthusiasm. The budget was returned between the two houses five times, and at 6:55 this morning, the House of Representatives passed it by 458 votes to 112, and the Senate passed it by 284 votes to 15. Parliament has approved the government's expenditures totaling 48,318,570,000 francs. It is estimated that the income and expenditures will offset each other, leaving a surplus of 9 million francs. However, if the government deems it necessary, it can still use delegated legislative orders to save expenditures. When Prime Minister Doumergue formed his cabinet, he predicted that he would urge Parliament to pass the budget within two months so that future government expenses would no longer be used in the provisional budget, and this has now been fulfilled.

<p>Securities Firm, Silver Market Initially Rises Then Falls</p>
<p>(New York) Today, the securities market is firmer and more optimistic than yesterday. According to some experts, this is due to the hope that the Securities Exchange Management Act will be greatly amended. Judging from the market situation, the actual position between bulls and bears in the securities market has improved significantly. Congressional review of the Securities Act in Washington has revealed a trend that certain provisions in the act may be deleted. However, the final form and outcome of the act are still in doubt. The securities market later turned quiet, but the price increases, mostly by one pound, were maintained. As the market seemed to remain stable, some people advocated buying when prices were weak. Although the silver market opened higher following news of firmer prices in London and Shanghai, profit-taking ensued near the close, causing prices to fall slightly. The rumor that Cuba intends to purchase silver was helpful to the silver market, but the rally was curbed by profit-taking. The silver market remained active, influenced by price comparisons in London. It is reported that India and China engaged in buying in today's market. Some parties still advocate buying less and waiting for more concrete news about the White Silver Act.</p>
<p>The cotton market was calm today, but with slight uncertainty, as there is no confirmed news about the Penhaid restriction on cotton production. People's hearts are indeed trending in multiple directions. According to general opinion, the cotton market will continue to be calm temporarily, with occasional slight fluctuations, until the cotton field management issue is resolved. Those with quick information believe that the government's move to control cotton production in the next season will eventually materialize, so it is advisable to buy after price declines.</p>
<p>Rubber was stable today, and sentiment was still good, as it showed sympathy with the trends in other markets. Commentators also suggested buying when prices fall.</p>
<p>Wheat opened slightly higher than yesterday's close, but prices trended lower before the end of today, although the actual position was healthier, so it is still advisable to be bullish. (28th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

At 8 AM, Zhang, in military uniform, crossed the river from Hankou to the Wuchang headquarters. More than 600 generals and representatives from all walks of life attended the ceremony. The atmosphere was solemn. The meeting opened at 9 AM as scheduled, with Zhang Qun, the Central Government's oath-taking officer, presiding. After the ceremony, Zhang Xueliang raised his right hand and took the oath. Zhang Qun delivered a speech, stating that Deputy Commander Zhang is one of the people who share the fate of the Party and the country. Since his trip to Europe last spring, he has traveled to various countries and has a deep understanding and careful study of the international situation and the new political and military facilities of various countries. This time, he has been honored with a special appointment. With the great trust of the Central Government, he must have good plans and great contributions to the Party and the country. Recalling February 11, President Wang and Chairman Chiang jointly telegraphed, reiterating the great plan to save the nation, suppress bandits to treat the symptoms, and promote production and construction to treat the root causes. The responsibilities of Deputy Commander Zhang in the future are closely related to this approach of treating both the symptoms and the root causes. On the one hand, he must be able to assist Commander-in-Chief Chiang in serving the country and achieving the complete suppression of bandits as soon as possible. On the other hand, he must have great plans for the political facilities in the three provinces, assist Commander-in-Chief Chiang, and plan for the victims of the disaster so that they can produce and construct, in order to live up to the expectations of the Party and the country. It is deeply believed that the responsible colleagues in the three provinces will also do their best to sincerely assist him. Next, Xia Douting, the representative of the National Government, delivered a speech, stating that without eliminating banditry, production and construction cannot be carried out. Therefore, we must first eliminate the remaining bandits, and then the country will have a way out. The banditry in the three provinces has gradually shrunk under the unified command and active supervision of Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Now that Deputy Commander Zhang has come to Hubei to assist, the bandit suppression work will be even smoother, and success can be predicted. Next, He Chengjun, the representative of Chairman Chiang, delivered a speech, stating that Deputy Commander Zhang has returned from his inspection in Europe and has a deep understanding and careful study of Western European civilization. He will definitely contribute to the country and achieve the path to rejuvenation. I hope that the generals in the three provinces will work hard to realize this goal, and I also hope that my colleagues will be open and honest, work together in harmony, be realistic, bury themselves in work, and strive for the survival of the country and the happiness of the people under the leadership of Deputy Commander Zhang. Finally, Zhang replied, stating that his knowledge is shallow and his experience is not very rich. He is ashamed and fearful to be entrusted with such an important task. In the future, he will only work hard under the plan and guidance of Commander-in-Chief Chiang with his conscience and enthusiasm, and hope that all sectors will give assistance and guidance from time to time. The three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui are located in the center of our country and are the economic center of the country. The future construction hub is of extraordinary importance. I will be diligent and conscientious and fulfill my national responsibilities in order to work hard in my post. The ceremony concluded at 10 AM, and photos were taken.

However, the economy is a prerequisite for construction. The Hangzhou municipal government currently has a debt of more than 300,000 yuan, and the finances are extremely difficult. Therefore, the first priority is to start with reorganizing finances. The connection between Shanghai and Hangzhou: in recent years, the rural economy in the interior has been exhausted. The reason for this is that finance flows from the interior to the cities, and then into the hands of foreigners in Shanghai. Therefore, he is determined to work hard to make Hangzhou a national scenic center, so that foreigners and wealthy people in Shanghai will be more willing to come to Hangzhou for tourism and residence. In this way, finance can be transferred from Shanghai back to Hangzhou, and then back to the interior, which can help revive the rural areas. He is holding this claim to preside over the city of Hangzhou. As for municipal administration, after the finances are sorted out, all urgent and important works concerning Hangzhou's security, sanitation, and dredging the West Lake and tidying the city appearance will be actively done one by one to meet the people of Hangzhou with facts.

<p>The divisions in Fujian are formed into two columns.</p>
<p>To connect the Jiangxi armies into one line.</p>
<p>Lin Shouchang drank a bullet after being arrested and died.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After Jiang Dingwen, the former commander-in-chief of the Northern Route, was promoted to commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route, he has established a headquarters in Xiamen and abolished the Northern Front Headquarters in Fuzhou on the 21st, changed to the Office of the Eastern Route Headquarters stationed in the province. Jiang can go to Xiamen to take up the post in one or two days. The new commander of the Eastern Route Front, Wei Lihuang, also led his troops from Quanzhou through Datian Dehua to the northwest. Now Chairman Jiang has instructed Jiang Wei to lead the divisions in Fujian to clear the Red Bandits who are disrupting the border between Fujian and Jiangxi within a time limit. The current troops in Fujian include Li Yutang, Leng Xin, Li Yannian, Li Moan, Song Xilian, Lu Xingbang, Liu Heding, Chen Mingren, Liu Kan, Wang Jingjiu, Sun Yuanliang, Chen Qixuan, Zhou Zhiqun, and Zhang Luanji, a total of 14 divisions. There are eight divisions concentrated in northern Fujian, which Chairman Jiang has organized into two columns, which are advancing towards Shaxian, Yong'an, Shunchang and Jiangle, in order to respond to the two bandit suppression armies of Chen Cheng and Gu Zhutong on the Jiangxi border. Liu Heding is the commander of the Ninth Column, commanding the three divisions of Lu Xingbang, Zhou Zhiqun, and Zhang Luanji, and is in charge of the right wing. Tang Enbo is the commander of the Tenth Column, commanding the three divisions of Leng Xin, Chen Mingren, and Sun Yuanliang, and is in charge of the left wing. According to military information yesterday, the vanguard of Sun's division on the left wing has crossed Shunchang and is advancing towards Jiangle. The rear teams are also advancing from Yanping towards Shunchang. Liu's division on the right wing has launched an attack from Yanping towards Shaxian. The battle on the Qingzhou side is gradually becoming more intense. Most of the bandits are now in the Shayong area and are rushing to build fortifications in preparation for resistance. Only a small number of Red Guards are left in the Jiangshun area, and their strength is very weak. Therefore, the main battle will be in Shaxian. Once Shaxian is down, Jiangle will lose its support and can be defeated without a fight. According to the plan of the military authorities, the first phase of the operation is to recover the four counties of Shayong Jiangshun within a month, and the second phase is to advance to Mingxi, Qingliu, Jianning, and Taining, so as to form a line with the National Army in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>The issue of disbanding the civilian army was ordered by the Nanchang camp to be handled by Chen Yi and Xiao Qian, the director and deputy director of the Security Department. Regarding the disbandment standards, not only the strength of the army must be paid attention to, but also the past history of the leaders must be investigated. It is expected that personnel will be dispatched to check the troops within a few days. Lin Zhen (ie Lin Shouchang), the commander of the Second Route of the Fujian Anti-Rebellion People's Army, was recently arrested by the Security Department by order of the Nanchang Camp for a certain case and was detained at the headquarters of the Fourth Regiment of the Constitution in Qingduguan. At 4:00 AM on the 23rd, he died from a bullet in Donghu Camp. According to military sources, it was originally planned to be sent to Nanchang for interrogation. Because Lin tried to escape at night, the guards fired to stop him and was killed by a bullet. His family prepared a coffin and collected the body in the evening. Another piece of news, the Security Department yesterday issued a notice to the civilian armies of various routes to cut off and submit all seals to the department. During this disbandment period, they are absolutely not allowed to engage in external activities. After the reorganization into security regiments in the future, they will also be strictly trained by the sub-bureaus of each district to become local self-defense forces. (February 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e127">Mechanical Industry Association Submits a Request for Interpretation of the "Knowledge" in Trademark Law <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical Chinese Products Factory Joint Association submitted a request to the Supreme Court yesterday for an interpretation of the meaning of the word "knowledge" in Article 2, Paragraph 6 of the Trademark Law, as it is considered ambiguous. The original text reads, "Submitted for the interpretation of similarity and resemblance in trademark law. We believe that the so-called 'mark known to the world' in Article 2, Paragraph 6 of the Trademark Law, does the word 'knowledge' include the word 'recognition'? We would like to request an interpretation to avoid disputes. The two words 'knowledge' and 'discussion' are often used together, but in reality, there is quite a difference between them. For example, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the same article are all discussed by those who have eyes, for fear that people will not know the truth and therefore misunderstand. Therefore, even similar ones should be prohibited. Those without eyes cannot know what the shape of the graphic symbol is to use for recognition. It can be asserted. However, most of the marks known to the world are bought by name. They only know one thing, but not the other. For example, the Triangle Brand towel and the Invincible Brand toothpaste have become known to the world after decades of advertising. Even blind people know that they never deceive the public. Some people pass it on by word of mouth and ask others to buy it on their behalf. Some have known its name for a long time but have never seen it. Knowing but not recognizing is like someone asking for directions, knowing the name of the destination but not recognizing the words. If there are similar places in singing and calling, wouldn't it mislead people? Therefore, when the Trademark Law was first formulated, there was also a considerable discussion on singing and calling in the translation of foreign statutory law. Now, does the word 'knowledge' in Article 2, Paragraph 6 of the Trademark Law include knowledge in the heart? If someone maliciously uses the same sound but different characters to insinuate a trademark known to the world, such as applying for registration of 'British Dan Commander' to use on the same type of goods as 'Indanthrene Blue', can it be allowed? Or can't different merchants use such similar trademarks? This matter concerns legal precedents, so we should submit a request for interpretation to prevent opportunism and eliminate the trend of deception. This is in the public interest."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Owners of Adjacent Properties to the Government's Sand Field Property Given Priority to Increase Lease and Extend Deadline by Two Months <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Land Bureau Posted a Notice Yesterday</p>
<p>In order to protect the property rights of the property owners adjacent to the government's sand field property, the Municipal Land Bureau had stipulated a deadline for the owners to increase their leases with priority. However, due to the short deadline, it was feared that the owners would not have enough time to apply for the increase. Therefore, the bureau extended the deadline by another two months so that the owners could leisurely apply for the increase or add rent. Yesterday, Special Announcement No. 97 was issued, which read, "After the municipality recovered the government's sand field property in the city and managed it independently, the disposal methods were previously stipulated to allow adjacent property owners or current occupants to increase their leases with priority. The owners of the adjacent permanent lease deeds can also request to add rent to the deed. Now that the deadline has expired, many applications have been received by the bureau. However, the municipality has a vast territory, and there are many who have not yet applied, possibly due to the short deadline and insufficient time. It is important to know that this sand field property is closely related to the property rights of the adjacent property owners. Once the priority lease increase period has passed and a third party applies for the lease, it will have a considerable impact on the use of the original land. Therefore, as a matter of seriousness, the deadline is extended by another two months, until April 30th of this year, as the deadline for priority lease increase for adjacent property owners, etc. Those who wish to increase the lease or add rent to the adjacent beaches, wasteland, and wharves must submit their applications to the bureau within the deadline or submit them through the consular office in charge. After this deadline expires, others will be allowed to apply for the lease freely, and no further extensions will be granted. Afterwards, the owners or tenants of the adjacent properties must not raise any objections or obstruct the process. In addition to reporting to the municipal government for record-keeping and separately notifying all parties, a notice is hereby issued for compliance."</p>

<h3 id="e135">After the Increase in Prices of Sichuan Steamers, the Transportation of Chinese Goods to Sichuan Will Be Blocked <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Sichuan Business Group Dealing in Foreign Sundries Changed to Transporting Domestic Products</p>
<p>The Increase in Freight Rates Creates Opportunities for the Dumping of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Group Decided to Send Representatives to Petition Society</p>
<p>The Sichuan River steamers' alliance to raise prices and the resulting backlash from the Sichuan business community has been reported in this newspaper. The most affected are the business groups dealing in foreign sundries. However, although this group is called "foreign sundries", they have completely switched to selling domestic products in recent years. This time, the increase in prices of the Sichuan steamers is unreasonable, with some freight rates even exceeding the cost of the goods, which will make it impossible for the industry to operate. Now that appeals have been ineffective, it has been decided to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. The reporter went to various parties yesterday to investigate and provide the details as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Unfair Rate Agreement <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Sichuan steamer alliance increased fees in the name of saving the shipping industry, increasing water feet, and maintaining costs. However, when representatives of the various shipping companies were negotiating new cargo prices, a Chinese person named Li and a Russian person drafted the water feet and increased the water feet for foreign sundries (which are actually all domestic products, with no foreign goods) to more than the cost of the goods, and charged by gross measurement. This kind of unreasonable new water feet, once implemented, will wipe out the domestic goods transported and sold to Sichuan, making it impossible to operate. The group once publicly discussed requesting a modification of this freight rate to show fairness, but was rejected by the shipping bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e137">New Prices Exceed the Cost of Goods <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The so-called "foreign general merchandise" includes enamelware, toothbrushes, silk stockings, thermos bottles, glass cups, children's toys, stainless steel utensils, bakelite bowls and saucers, as well as toothpaste, lanterns, and other such items. These are numerous and varied, and all are manufactured by our own factories. Last year, these domestic goods were sold at low prices, and many were shipped to Sichuan. In the shipping companies' freight bills, they were all listed under the category of "foreign general merchandise." In reality, the cost is not high. For example, a box occupying 30 square feet of space would have a value of only sixty or seventy yuan. This is because most of these goods take up a lot of space. Now, the new freight rates for Sichuan-bound ships have increased to eighty yuan per ton. With each ton calculated at forty cubic feet, the shipping cost for one box of goods would be sixty yuan. Furthermore, fees are collected by size, regardless of gross or net weight. In practice, the freight cost is even greater than the value of the goods.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Domestic Goods Unable to Be Transported to Sichuan <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The "foreign general merchandise" industry believes that this new freight rate will make it impossible to transport domestic goods to Sichuan. Even if the price of goods is moderately increased due to the high freight costs, it is impossible to raise the price of one yuan goods to two yuan. This price increase clearly cuts off the operating path for those dealing in domestic goods. At a time when Japanese goods are seeking to dump their products on the market, this is nothing short of creating an excellent opportunity for them. This is because Japanese goods utilize their own country's ships to promote sales upstream along the Yangtze River in a continuous stream. The result will be not only significant losses for the Sichuan "foreign general merchandise" industry, but also a blow to domestic goods.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Request for Relief for the People's Livelihood <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Tai Koo, Jardine Matheson, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are foreign businesses, so the current price increase is somewhat understandable. However, the Minsheng Company, which has the most ships and the greatest influence in the Sichuan River, and which advocates for the principle of people's livelihood, is a Chinese business. It should be providing assistance for the transport of domestic goods to Sichuan. Yet, when the freight rates were revised, it was the representative of this company who proposed the increase. They only considered the increase in freight rates, and not the suffering of the people's livelihood. This is especially painful to the industry. Currently, the Sichuan "foreign general merchandise" industry, in addition to having already stopped ordering goods, has decided to elect representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau to suppress this unreasonable freight rate and prevent the nascent domestic goods industry from suffering a significant setback. The petition is already being drafted and will be submitted immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Creating a Situation Where Others Reap the Benefits <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>A total of seven shipping companies have joined the agreement to raise rates for Sichuan routes. However, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has not joined because its ship, the "Mount Emei," ran aground and is not in operation. In addition, the Nissin Company did not join the alliance. After the rate increase, the Chekiang Second Ship "Yiping" and the Minsheng Second Ship "Minkang" left port yesterday with only a small amount of cotton yarn. Not a single piece of general merchandise was on board. The two sides are in a standoff. Japanese ships are planning to take this opportunity to resume navigation on the Sichuan River. They are not bound by the agreement and can freely adjust freight rates to stir up trouble. At that time, the "foreign general merchandise" industry will inevitably load onto Japanese ships due to their lower freight rates. This is the result of the Minsheng Company and others. When the snipe and clam fight, the fisherman profits. It is a truly painful matter.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Owners of McGill Road Apartments Cut Off Water Yesterday Due to Water Fee Dispute <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Notice Issued Seeking Assistance</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the tenants of McGill Road apartments, after receiving a notice from the owner, the Ewo Bank, on the 26th of last month, giving them 24 hours to pay the water fees, all decided to abide by last year's court decision and stop paying the water fees due to the owner's unreasonable demands. At the same time, they also convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures. Yesterday (the 1st), the owner's side acted according to the letter, sending two foreigners and one Chinese to the apartments and cutting off the water supply to all the tenants. They also posted notices to attract tenants, as a warning. The rent reduction association of the apartments convened an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss the matter. The results were: (1) notify members to withhold water fees and wait for a resolution; (2) file a lawsuit according to law; (3) request assistance from the rent reduction committee due to the owner's unreasonable oppression. However, the owner, Ewo Bank, sent a letter to the New Sound News Agency, clarifying that the court had not rejected their claims. The tenants' notice and the owner's original letter are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Tenants' Notice <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Notice from the McGill Road Branch of the First Special District of the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee: Regarding the matter of the notice, it has been found that the landlord of this apartment building previously increased the water fee by two yuan per household, causing all 400+ residents to rise up in opposition. Zhong Delin, Wu Jiaxiang, Jin Derong, and others argued reasonably and resisted. They went to court on August 12th of last year and the court ruled that the owner's unreasonable increase of the water fee by two yuan was inconsistent with the water company's regulations and rejected the floating collection in court. Subsequently, the owner disregarded public reason and violated the law, still collecting two yuan per household, and cutting off the water pipes if payment was delayed, disregarding the livelihood of the people and ignoring the drinking water of the community. This committee, out of concern for the general welfare of the working class, has specially sent a document to the general committee requesting assistance. In addition, all residents are required to pay the rent as usual, but to unanimously withhold the additional two yuan for the water fee, and wait for this committee to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law, and wait for a solution. This notice is given to ensure everyone is aware.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Letter to the Rent Reduction Committee <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the rent reduction branch of the apartment building sent a letter to the rent reduction committee requesting assistance: Respectfully, our committee is in its initial stage of preparation and many matters are pending. Suddenly, residents Zhong Delin, Wu Jiaxiang, Jin Derong, and others came to the committee to report that the owner of the building sent two foreigners and two Chinese to collect water fees of two yuan per household, aggressively demanding payment, and cutting off the water pipes of those who could not afford to pay (three families), disregarding the drinking water of the community and ignoring the people's livelihood to the extreme. According to the investigation, the water fee was increased by two yuan not before the lease began, but after the lease was already in effect. This had already caused the residents to rise up in opposition. On August 12th of last year, the special district court ruled that the owner's floating collection was unreasonable and completely inconsistent with the water company's regulations, and rejected the floating collection in court. Now the owner is using the collection of water fees as an excuse for intentional provocation. We are specially submitting a document to the general committee requesting assistance in accordance with the law in order to reassure the public. This is truly a matter of public concern.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Owner's Statement <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Ewo Bank, the owner of the apartments, sent a letter to the New Sound News Agency yesterday, stating: Respectfully, I read the article "Owner of McGill Road Apartments Causes Repercussions by Limiting Water Fee Payments" in the local news section of the newspaper on the 25th. The content of the article published by your agency is not in accordance with the facts. The McGill Road water fee is based on a contract between the water company and the owner, which collects 7.5% of the rent. Therefore, the owner also collects the water fee from the tenants at 7.5% of the rent and merges it with the rent. Since May of last year, the water company suddenly changed its rules and ordered the owner to install water meters and collect fees based on the actual amount of water consumed. After implementation, the water fee expenditure has increased by more than two times. The owner's losses are too great, and we were forced to send a letter to each tenant in July, notifying them that we would increase the water fee by three yuan per household in order to subsidize the losses. We also stated that if tenants did not want to pay the increased water fee, they could install their own water meters, which would be fair. Later, the joint office of the tenants of the apartments sent a letter expressing their understanding, but requested that starting in August of the 22nd year, they would agree to pay an additional water fee of two yuan per month per household. The owner, for the sake of mutual understanding, reluctantly accepted, and did not take into account the losses for June and July. Subsequently, more than 100 tenants in the apartments have been paying the monthly fees as agreed. However, three tenants, Zhong Delin, Jin Derong, and Wu Jiaxiang, have violated the unanimous public opinion of the joint office and insisted on refusing to pay. Despite repeated persuasion, they have refused to listen. As of December of last year, in addition to the unpaid water fees, Zhong and Wu also owed several months of rent. The owner initially requested mediation from the court, but the mediation failed because the opposing party disagreed. Subsequently, a lawsuit was filed. Regarding the water fee portion, the court stated that since the defendant had not agreed, a separate lawsuit was required. The news report stating that the court had rejected the floating collection is clearly not true. As for the notice of deadline for payment of water fees the day before yesterday, it was only for these very few three households, and not all tenants received the notice. The truth of the matter still awaits a legal resolution, but the inaccuracies in the report should be corrected. Therefore, the true facts of the matter are hereby communicated to your agency, and we request that you publish a correction in order to restore credibility. Thank you very much. Ewo Bank, Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Overview of the Shanghai Wharf Affairs Office's Compilation of Work <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Wharf Affairs Office was officially established in the winter of the 21st year by order of the Central Government, it has appropriately handled all disputes between labor and contractor businesses in the city's various wharves. The most important of these include resolving the disputes between the workers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau warehouse in Pudong and the split accounting heads, the disputes between the workers of the Yongchang warehouse in Pudong and the split accounting heads, and the disputes between the workers of the Dada Wharf and Datong warehouse and the contractors. A mediation decision was signed for each of these cases to ensure mutual adherence. As for other wharf disputes, the office handles several cases every day, and the office manages to resolve them and eliminate major disputes between labor and contractors invisibly, which greatly assists social security. As for charitable projects, such as the establishment of labor schools and workers' clubs, they provide wharf workers with a good opportunity to receive education. Currently, the office, in view of the fact that the outside world has not fully understood its work, has specially compiled a book summarizing its work from the date of its establishment to the end of December of the 22nd year. The content is rich and contains many important statistics related to the city's various wharves. It is said that this summary of work will be printed soon. It is expected that after it is printed, anyone concerned about the city's wharf business will have a good reference.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Wharf Affairs Office has spared no effort in handling all business matters between labor and contractors in the city's wharves. The office has now drafted a work plan for this year, which includes organization, mediation, welfare, and statistics. The plan includes conducting registration and organizing wharf labor unions and branch offices, establishing training classes for cadres and workers, promoting wharf workers' clubs, preparing for workers' savings and mutual assistance associations, adding worker's supplementary schools, workers' children's schools, establishing wharf workers' consumer cooperatives, and other matters. The office is now instructing the guidance section to intensify its work and proceed separately. After this plan is implemented, the city's wharf workers will receive many benefits.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Min Luoting, alternate executive committee member of the Two-Road Special Party Department and executive committee member of the Two-Road Labor Union, was reported to the Central Party Department. After the Party Department sent personnel to the road to investigate, it was found that Min had handled the labor strike that occurred at the Wusong Machinery Factory on the Two-Roads improperly. Therefore, it was ordered that he be dismissed and investigated. The Two-Road Party Department is currently conducting a thorough investigation in order to report back to the Central Government.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Customs to Stop Eviction of Firewood Boats from Dongjiadu <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs yesterday, stating: With respect, the firewood and charcoal industry association members' cargo ships in the city are moored in the area south of Dongjiadu at the location designated by the Public Works Bureau Wharf Management Office. Recently, they have been arbitrarily evicted by the customs patrol boats, which has hindered business and caused panic among the public. The association requested negotiation with the Chamber of Commerce. On the 23rd of this month, we forwarded a letter of complaint to your office, requesting you to instruct the relevant agency not to take action in order to maintain the livelihood of the people. On the 28th of this month, we received a follow-up letter from the association stating that, according to reports from various colleagues, not only has the customs patrol boat not stopped the eviction, but the suppression has intensified, ordering ship owners to moor at customs-designated locations. In view of this, after investigation, we believe that the Jianghai Customs patrol boats are so hostile to our cargo ships and interfere so greatly that the public is in constant fear. If this causes a strike among ship merchants, it will have a great impact on the fuel supply of residents and the social stability. Therefore, we urgently request that you quickly find a way to negotiate with the Jianghai Customs and prevent the situation from escalating.</p>

<p>Officially Started Yesterday</p>
<p>The Old West Gate in this city is the most prosperous area in the Chinese district. The area crosses six roads, including Zhonghua Road, Zhaojia Road, Fangxie Road, and Heping Road. Traffic is heavy and frequent, making traffic maintenance difficult. Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has set up a red and green traffic light in the center of each road to maintain order. The construction of the traffic light and the aerial police officer's box has been completed, and it was officially started yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Red Cross Society Recruitment of Members Opened Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society's membership recruitment convention opened yesterday. It is scheduled to host a banquet for the captains of the various teams at the Dadong Restaurant at 6:00 PM today. In recent days, the radio stations have been broadcasting the general idea that "Everyone has an important report now, please pay special attention to all circles, that is, the Chinese Red Cross Society, has been founded for 30 years. The number of people who have helped the people and rescued soldiers is no less than tens of millions. It is not only the leader of the charity circles in the country, but also won a lot of glory in the international arena. Now the Red Cross Society is ordered by the Ministry of the Interior, from March 1 to April 30, as the period for recruiting members. Today is the first day of the opening ceremony. I hope that all circles will enthusiastically participate, so as to fulfill the obligations that nationals should fulfill in the international arena, so that China's charitable status in the international arena will increase day by day. Because in the Eastern countries, like Siam, the population is about 8 million and there are more than 90,000 members. The Red Cross Society of Japan has about 3.88 million members, accounting for 20% of the national population. China is known as 400 million compatriots, and only 100,000 have joined the club, which is inevitably dwarfed, making the world think that the Chinese are less charitable than friendly countries. Therefore, the Chinese Red Cross Society wants to expand its business in rescue, disaster relief, treatment, and health in times of war and peace, so that all compatriots in the country can be safely guaranteed. Now, during the solicitation period, please ask the compassionate compatriots to quickly join the Red Cross Society. I think all philanthropists will certainly do what is right and not give in to benevolence. The General Assembly of the Red Cross Society is at No. 42 Jiujiang Road in Shanghai, and their branch is set up in more than 500 places in provinces, cities and counties. Please go to the nearby to connect with the treatment, and if you want to know the rank of members, you can ask the Red Cross Society to read the rules and regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e153">One Person Arrested and Taken to Bureau for Trial in Yangshupu Wharf Worker Conflict Case <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Rongji Company contracted the loading and unloading work at the Sino-American Petroleum Company warehouse in Yangshupu Wharf, Pudong on January 1 of this year. On the 10th of last month, the work began for the first time. Unexpectedly, while the work was in progress, more than 100 people resembling workers suddenly came forward to stop the work, resulting in a conflict. As a result, both sides were injured. A lawsuit was once filed, but altercations occurred repeatedly when work was done later on, and the company sent people to try their best to persuade them to temporarily maintain peace. However, rumors were rampant for a while, and everyone said that if the Rongji Company did not stop working, a bloody tragedy would inevitably occur. So Rongji heard the news and asked the Municipal Public Security Bureau to prevent it. On the 26th of last month, Director Wen ordered Pei Chengzong, the captain of the third squadron of the police corps, to lead more than a dozen police officers to be stationed there. However, at about 3:00 PM the following day (27th), 16 Rongji workers were unloading goods at the wharf when about 200 workers, each wearing a red cloth, came to the wharf together and forced them to stop working. At that time, Captain Pei, seeing the situation, urgently explained the importance of the situation to the crowd, persuading them to send representatives to come up with reasonable reasons to discuss calmly, and not to disrupt public order, which would cause inconvenience. The workers temporarily elected seven people to talk to Pei. The workers insisted on stopping work immediately before they could discuss, but the Sino-American Company believed that kerosene was very dangerous and time was of the essence, so the two sides could not come to an agreement. Immediately, more than 200 people caused a riot and rushed into the wharf together. The police tried to stop them, but there were a large number of workers, and the momentum was like a tide. At the same time, someone in the crowd shouted and beat them. In an instant, wooden sticks and iron rulers were raised together, and they knocked down squad leader Fu Jichuan, police officer Xu Jingren, and Miao Jingshan, and beat them severely. They also seized the gun shells from the police officers. Captain Pei tried his best to avoid escalating the situation, but the situation was very dangerous. For the sake of self-defense, the police fired empty shots into the sky as a warning, but at the same time, several gunshots occurred in the crowd. Suddenly, the order was disrupted, and the workers dispersed from all sides. At this time, Captain Fu's arm had been injured, and squad leader Fu Qingchuan, police officer Xu Jingren, and Miao Jingshan were all seriously injured and groaned on the ground. On the worker's side, three people were also injured by gunfire. The company urgently used the telephone to notify the nearby Sacred Heart Hospital on Ningguo Road to send an ambulance to send the injured people to the hospital for treatment. Captain Pei urgently reported to Director Wen and asked for instructions. It was said that of the three injured workers, except for two who were not in critical condition, the other was in critical condition. According to the results of the investigation by the Public Security Bureau, most of the gunshots were believed to be pistol bullets. However, the police officers sent there were all using box cannons and long guns, so they paid close attention to this matter and feared that disruptors were inciting trouble from the middle, so they planned to investigate thoroughly. Unexpectedly, the next day, Captain Pei suddenly ran into one of the seven representatives at the Yangshupu small vegetable market and arrested him. He was handed over to the nearby gang and taken to the police station. He was escorted to the First Special Court yesterday. According to the confession, his name is Han Dexin, from Shandong. The rest of the words were vague. Han requested bail in court, but the police station found that Han had been sentenced to imprisonment in the boundary. The police lawyer objected to bail. Captain Pei stated in court that Han had committed a crime in the court at the time. The Public Security Bureau sent someone to request that the court allow him to be taken to the court. Han was handed over to the staff and taken back to the case for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e159">The Truth About the Meng Qingrong Wrongful Case of Accusation of Gambling Has Come to Light <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Gamblers Conspire to Frame Him</p>
<p>Judge Corrects Wrongful Conviction</p>
<p>Meng Qingrong, a man from Shandong and awaiting assignment at the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, previously served in the bureau's Inspectorate at the direction of the bureau chief, specializing in cracking down on gambling. Because Meng was diligent in his work and had solved numerous lottery gambling cases, he was deeply resented by various lottery gambling ringleaders. Huang Yanxiaobao, a well-known lottery hooligan in the Nanshi area, had a particularly deep grudge against Meng. On December 1st of the previous year, at approximately 3:00 PM, he instigated his henchman, Zhang Yinbin (also known as Zhenyue), to open all the chests and trunks in his house, drag out and scatter all the clothes, making a complete mess. He then rushed out to report to the police officers on duty, claiming that Meng Qingrong, an official from the Police Bureau's Inspectorate who called himself Commissioner Meng, along with several companions wearing blue cloth short-sleeved shirts and trousers, had come to his house under the pretext of searching for lottery gambling activities, ransacked the chests and trunks, and conducted a thorough search, resulting in nothing being found. However, a gold bracelet, a gold ring, and a Wan Guochu Xu Hui savings certificate stored in the chest were allegedly stolen while they were there and taken away. He requested an investigation. Upon receiving the report, the police officers accompanied Zhang to his home at No. 1 Hengxing Dongli, 16th Pu, and found the chests open and the clothes scattered. They were unaware that this was Zhang's trickery and reported the situation to the district chief, who in turn reported it to the Municipal Police Bureau for review and handling. Upon hearing the report, Bureau Chief Wen sent officers to investigate. Because the matter involved dereliction of duty, Meng was immediately dismissed from his post and transferred to the court, where he was sentenced to five months' imprisonment. However, Meng argued that on December 1st of the previous year, he was under orders to go to the territory under the jurisdiction of the First District Second Precinct to arrest lottery gamblers. He had no free time to go to Zhang's house to conduct the search that Zhang accused him of. The imprisonment sentence was based on completely false facts. He refused to accept the sentence and immediately filed an appeal. After a detailed investigation by the court, it was finally revealed that Meng had indeed been falsely accused due to resentment. Therefore, the court announced the previous sentence overturned and declared him not guilty. The injustice Meng had suffered was finally redressed.</p>

Seized were one set of Pai Gow, one set of poker cards, one set of mahjong tiles, six dice, one shaker, gambling money of forty-seven yuan (including five counterfeit yuan), forty-six double-dime coins, and two hundred and fifty copper coins.

<p>The original petition from the inventors to Mayor Wu reads: "Petition for assistance in the invention of a self-powered engine. Chunqiao, Xinbiao, and others have been researching for more than ten years, sacrificing countless efforts and finances, and have invented a 'self-powered engine' that does not require any fuel consumption, only a small amount of water, and can start the engine wheel with a twist of a knob. Its driving force is the same as that of existing motors and engines that use electricity, kerosene, and other fuels, and its advantages surpass them. The size of the horsepower can be constructed according to needs. After repeated tests, it has been successful. We originally intended to reproduce the entire machine and make it practical, but due to the excessive sacrifices made during the research, we have failed to fulfill our wishes. Therefore, we respectfully submitted a petition to the National Government, requesting assistance, and submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting approval for protection, etc. We recently received a reply from the Chairman of the National Government, stating, 'If there is indeed an invention, drawings and instructions should be submitted to the Academia Sinica or the local competent authorities for verification and handling.' In response, we have attached drawings and instructions to this petition and personally visit Your Excellency to present the details in person. If this is not the case, how dare we come here boldly? We earnestly implore Your Excellency to approve our request and provide guidance. Respectfully presented to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai Municipality, by petitioners Chen Xinbiao and Shan Chunqiao."</p>

Accordingly, we are copying the original letter and sending it to you, hoping that you will verify, contact, handle the matter, and reply.

<p>Because the Effectiveness of Vaccination Gradually Decreases Over Time</p>
<p>According to the Director of the Public Health Department of the Public Works Department, people generally believe that once vaccinated against smallpox, they are immune for life. This view has now been proven to be inaccurate. According to statistics and observations in the United States and elsewhere, the effectiveness of vaccination gradually decreases over time. Therefore, it is now generally recognized that children who have been vaccinated at a very young age must be revaccinated at the age of seven. After the age of seven, adults should be revaccinated every three years to strengthen their</p>

<p>However, people often forget the danger when they are safe. Once smallpox has been eliminated, people hesitate to get vaccinated. When prevention is neglected, smallpox inevitably becomes prevalent again, and then people rush to get vaccinated. Looking at the figures for the previous year in this district, smallpox was initially rare, but it suddenly became prevalent in December and January, and the number of vaccinations also increased sharply. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent smallpox. Looking at the statistics from the previous year, the Chinese Isolation Hospital under the Bureau received a total of 137 patients with smallpox throughout the year, of which 49 died. Among the deceased, 34 had never been vaccinated at all, and the remaining 12 had been vaccinated, but it was more than three years ago. Out of the total of 137 patients admitted, 50 had never been vaccinated, and 77 had not been revaccinated on schedule. Therefore, the</p>

<p>Cannot be overemphasized. Moreover, smallpox can occur under any circumstances, regardless of wealth or poverty, and regardless of the poor or good living conditions. Therefore, it is hoped that all people, for their own sake and for the sake of the public, will implement the "vaccinate once every three years" method to avoid the spread of smallpox.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Big Fire in Zhabei Wasteland <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>More Than Fifty Thatched and Tile Houses Were Destroyed</p>
<p>The Arsonist is on the Run; Only a Suspect Has Been Arrested</p>
<p>Behind Xiangyuan Lane on Zhangqiao Road in Zhabei was originally a wasteland, covering more than thirty mu. Ten years ago, it was occupied by poor people from Jiangbei, who built thatched houses. To date, there are more than three hundred houses, lined up side by side, forming a market town. However, the fuel used by the poor is all straw, so fires often occur due to forgotten embers, causing fires. In the winter of the previous year, it was once completely burned down, causing an unprecedented tragedy. Unexpectedly, at around 3:30 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out at the home of Chen Wentao, who works as a driver for the Public Concession Tram Company. Chen had returned home after finishing work at midnight and was hungry, so he cooked porridge to eat. Accidentally, a spark fell on the straw, and by the time he noticed it, the fire had become a prairie fire. Moreover, due to the dry weather, it spread easily. A group of neighbors were awakened from their dreams and fled in panic. At the same time, although this place is under the jurisdiction of the Third Precinct of the Fifth District, there is no station set up, so by the time the residents ran to the precinct to report, the fire was out of control. The Zhabei fire brigades received the news and quickly sent fire engines to the scene to put out the fire. However, there were no firefighting facilities here, so the firefighters could not help. Therefore, the fire spread further, reaching Baolingtang Pharmacy at No. 110 Zhangqiao Road and the buildings at Nos. 7 and 8 Xiangyuan Lane. Fortunately, the nearby waterways were pointed out by the residents, and the firefighters quickly extended the hoses to the Shajing River and drew water to put out the fire. After about two hours, the entire fire was extinguished. As a result, more than forty thatched houses and ten tile houses were destroyed, as well as two buildings in Xiangyuan Lane and two rear buildings and attics of Baolingtang. The losses were significant. The arsonist, Chen Wentao, fled without a trace after the fire broke out. Only a suspect, Li Jinxiu, was arrested. After being interrogated by the Third Precinct of the Fifth District, he was released on bail. Meanwhile, the arsonist is being pursued for interrogation.</p>

<p>A Gold Ring Sparks Endless Disputes</p>
<p>Four Front Teeth Barely Escape Death</p>
<p>Dong Luyuan, a young man of 19, residing at No. 74, Miezhu Street, outside the Great East Gate in the South City, lost his parents and inherited real estate worth over ten thousand yuan. Unmarried, he previously studied at school, but recently dropped out to indulge in a life of idleness and neglecting his proper occupation. Qian Yangshi, a woman from Huzhou, aged 41, living in the front building of the three-story house above the octagonal shop (i.e., the overpass building in De Xing Lane), No. 585, Fada Road, had a deceased husband and a daughter named A'bao, aged 19. A'bao possessed a somewhat ordinary appearance. About a month ago, she encountered Dong on the road. Because Dong's face was covered with pockmarks, he was immediately struck by A'bao's beauty, considering her a celestial being. However, he did not know her residence and had no way to communicate his affections. Fortunately, Dong had a friend nicknamed Zhang Jiuguan, who was acquainted with a Mr. Lu living in the back building of A'bao's residence. Zhang, knowing Dong's intentions, led him to Lu's place. From then on, Dong was able to see A'bao more often, gradually striking up conversations and getting closer. Later, Dong visited A'bao's house every afternoon, using playing mahjong as a pretext to seduce her. A'bao, being young and with her affections newly awakened, disregarded the consequences and was eventually enticed by Dong. Dong, feeling that the time was ripe, on the evening of the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month of the previous year, lured A'bao out under the pretense of watching a movie. They went to a hotel together and engaged in intimate relations. Afterward, A'bao asked Dong for a coat, but Dong was stingy and only gave her his own nine-carat gold ring as a memento. Since then, their affections were intertwined. However, beautiful scenes do not last. Recently, Dong found out that A'bao had another lover, and he felt extremely resentful. On the afternoon of the seventeenth of last month (i.e., the third day of the Lunar New Year), at about nine o'clock, he first went to A'bao's house alone to borrow two yuan, in an attempt to test her feelings. At that time, A'bao replied that money matters were handled by her mother and she could not comply with his request. At this point, Dong, feeling that he was being treated coldly and denied the loan, was certain that A'bao had another lover. He left in a fit of anger. Later, he gathered four hooligans, including Gao Fusheng and Zhang Jiuguan, and rushed to A'bao's house to argue with her. They forcibly removed the gold ring she was wearing on her hand. In addition, one of the hooligans with bad eyes slapped A'bao twice on the cheek. A'bao, unable to bear the humiliation, felt overwhelmed with shame and resentment. Taking advantage of a moment when no one was paying attention, she opened the window and jumped onto the balcony, throwing herself down onto Fada Road. When Dong and the others saw A'bao falling, they scattered and fled the building, disappearing without a trace. A'bao, due to the high fall, lost four front teeth, broke her right leg, and fainted from the pain. Her mother, Qian Yangshi, rushed down, hired a car, and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, A'bao's mother, believing that her daughter's suicide attempt was caused by Dong's coercion, reported the incident to the Dazimingzhong Police Station, requesting an arrest and investigation. The police chief, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Detective Lu Dongliang, No. 97, to investigate and inquire about Dong's whereabouts. By three o'clock the next afternoon, they learned that Dong was hiding at a friend's place on the upper floor of a tin shop at No. 343, West Zilaihuo Street. They secretly went to the address, arrested Dong, confiscated the gold ring, and took him to the police station to be sent to the Second District Local Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday, Judge Qiu Huanying continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. Yao Zhaodi, the police station's lawyer, explained the police station's investigation process, accusing Dong of robbery in collusion with three or more people, according to Article 348 of the Criminal Law. Subsequently, Dong testified that the gold ring was a gift he gave to A'bao. He bought the gold ring three months ago at Lao Qingyun Silver Shop with his niece-in-law, spending ten yuan. This time, when he asked A'bao for money, she took off the gold ring and threw it on the table because she didn't have any money. He did not rob her by force, nor did he beat her. He hired a lawyer to defend him and requested bail. The police station's lawyer opposed bail, arguing that Dong's crime was very serious. They then questioned the plaintiff, Qian Yangshi, about Dong's robbery of the gold ring and A'bao's jumping from the building. After verifying the testimonies in court, the judge ordered a postponement until the morning of the seventh for further questioning. The defendant provided a reliable shop as guarantor and assumed a guarantee responsibility of 5,000 yuan, otherwise he would be detained without bail.</p>

<p>Cohabitation Ends After a Year with a Divorce</p>
<p>Accusations of Abandonment and Fraud</p>
<p>Shi Wenying, a woman from Suzhou, residing at No. 5, Gufuli, Dagu Road, is thirty-two years old and does not have a formal spouse. She lives with her elderly mother, who earns a living by spinning yarn, while she supports herself by washing clothes for others. Wu Hongzhang, a man from Ningbo, nearly fifty years old, residing at No. 23, Fushouli, Airjin Road, was introduced to Shi's house to play mahjong in the summer of the year before last. He became acquainted with Wenying. Although Wenying is a middle-aged woman and not particularly beautiful, Wu was fond of her and said that his wife's position was still vacant, willing to make a lifelong commitment. Thus, they began to live together as husband and wife. Wu was responsible for the household expenses, providing thirty yuan a month. However, after only a year, Wu suddenly stopped coming, neglecting Shi and her mother. Although they repeatedly reasoned with him, there was no satisfactory outcome. Wenying then filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Local Court against Wu for abandonment and fraud. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the court to summon the parties for questioning. The plaintiff, Shi Wenying, testified that after she began cohabiting with the defendant in September of the year before last, the defendant suddenly told her one day that he needed money and asked her to find a way to get him 1,000 yuan. She, thinking that they were husband and wife, could not refuse and borrowed 400 yuan from a close female friend, along with 200 yuan from her mother's savings for her coffin, and gave it all to the defendant. However, after obtaining the money, he disappeared and never came back. She later learned that the defendant already had a wife and that his previous words were all lies. Therefore, she is now accusing him of abandonment and fraud. When questioned, the defendant, Wu Hongzhang, admitted to going to the plaintiff's house to gamble and knowing the plaintiff, but firmly denied defrauding the plaintiff of money. However, Shi Wenying claimed that she could invite the friend who lent her the money to testify in court. Judge Huang then ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

<p>Leading a Large Group of Students to Observe the Trial</p>
<p>Conflicting Testimonies, Awaiting Further Investigation</p>
<p>Zhuo Jiezhen, the female principal of Baocui Primary School in Tianfuli, Airjin Road, previously hired a lawyer to file a case in the First Special District Court against Zhong Yaorong, the owner of the Hao Shi Lai Food Shop on Jielu Road, accusing him of obstructing freedom and defaming her reputation. The Special Court has already summoned the parties for questioning once, but the defendant did not appear, and the hearing was postponed. Details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui took the bench in the Second Criminal Court to continue the hearing. The plaintiff, Zhuo Jiezhen, led the entire student body of the school, about seventy or eighty boys and girls, to the court to observe the trial. The defendant, Zhong Yaorong, also came to court with his attorney, Wu Shaoshan. The plaintiff, Zhuo Jiezhen, stated that she founded Baocui Primary School in 1928. On January 13 of this year, she hired Ms. Zhong Quyue'e as a teacher. Ms. Zhong is the defendant's daughter-in-law and the daughter of the introducer, Qu Yuehua. Before teaching for even half a month, Quyue'e suddenly took two days of leave on January 29 and 30, and did not return to school after the expiration of her leave, resulting in the suspension of classes. Because the school's reputation and the children's studies were affected, she and her husband, Tan Qingpu, went to the defendant's place on February 1 with Quyue'e's younger sister, Qu Yuechan, to negotiate. The defendant then accused her of impersonating the principal and abducting his daughter-in-law. He also incited the shop staff to beat her and her husband, restricting their freedom. After two hours, he called the police to send them to the police station, and they were later released. However, the defendant's insulting remarks and restriction of freedom constitute defamation and obstruction of freedom. When questioned, the defendant, Zhong Yaorong, stated that Qu Yue'e is his daughter-in-law, but he did not know that she was teaching at the plaintiff's school. On February 1, the plaintiff and her husband came to make a scene, saying that his daughter-in-law owed them money. However, because his daughter-in-law had been involved in litigation with him for years, he did not know her whereabouts, so he refused them. He did not expect the plaintiff to gather many people and come to beat him, so he called the police together to the police station. He did not accuse her of impersonating the principal or abducting his daughter-in-law. The witness, Qu Yuechan, testified that the defendant restricted Principal Zhuo's freedom and insulted her. Judge Liu stated that further investigation of this case was necessary and ordered a postponement to the sixth for further questioning.</p>

<p>Service Can Start in the Summer of This Year</p>
<p>The Dongjiadu Ferry Terminal in this city is a major route for people traveling to and from the three counties of Shangnan Chuan. More than 10,000 citizens cross the Huangpu River every day, making it the most important ferry terminal. The Municipal Government, recognizing the needs of the citizens, had planned to prepare a municipal service as early as 1928, but the project required a large amount of funding, so it was delayed. Recently, the Fifth District Executive Committee of the Municipal Party Department, recognizing the dangerous overloading of passengers on the existing ferry services and for the purpose of revitalizing the Pudong commercial market, submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department's Executive Committee, requesting the Municipal Government to quickly take back the municipal operation and open a ferry service to facilitate public travel. The Executive Committee's three standing committee members, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, and Tong Xingbai, sent a letter to the Municipal Government, urging it to instruct the Xingye Trust Company to organize the ferry service. The Municipal Government has replied that the Dongjiadu cross-river ferry is currently being actively prepared by the Xingye Trust Company. The Municipal Government also received requests from all sectors of industry, commerce, and education in Tangqiao Township, Pudong, requesting the speedy establishment of the Dongjiadu ferry service, and therefore urged the Xingye Trust Company to actively prepare for it. It is now learned that the company has raised more than 100,000 yuan in capital for the Dongjiadu ferry service plan and is planning detailed designs for the ferry and wharf. It is said that the future Dongjiadu cross-river ferry's wharf and ferry equipment will be superior to the existing equipment on Dongmen Road. Specially made double-ended copper-hulled ferries will be used, which will be stable to sail and easy to berth. Therefore, the crossing time will only take a maximum of two minutes each time. Once the design plan is completed, a public tender will be held, and it is expected that the service can be implemented in the summer of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Request for Exemption from Tax on Low-Quality Diesel Fuel <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>A Document Presented by the Zhejiang Private Electricity Industry Association to the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Private Electricity Industry Association, located at No. 212 Nanjing Road in this city, stated that the tax increase on low-quality diesel fuel has a significant impact on the electricity industry. It has already petitioned the Legislative Yuan to find a way to provide relief. The original document is as follows: The petition is about the extremely heavy tax on diesel fuel, which could lead to the demise of the electricity industry. It is hoped that the Legislative Yuan will quickly provide relief to alleviate the difficulties of businesses and save them from their predicament. It is reported that Announcement No. 1335, jointly issued by the Jianghai Customs Superintendent and the Commissioner of Customs, states that in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, new standards for taxing imported diesel fuel have been established: (A) Thick diesel fuel: 2.90 yuan gold units per ton; (B) Thin diesel fuel (including crude oil for refining): 26.30 yuan gold units per ton, approximately equivalent to 49 yuan in national currency, effective from February 1, 1934. Upon hearing this, the members of the association were panicked and believed that the current price of thin diesel fuel is more than 70 yuan per ton, and the increased tariff has reached 70% of the fuel price. Business operations will be impossible to maintain and will be in a dire situation. They have repeatedly appealed to the government to find a way to provide relief. The Zhejiang Provincial Electricity Company uses diesel engines for power generation, accounting for 89% (the situation in other provinces is similar). The annual demand for diesel fuel is more than 6,000 tons. According to the current fuel price calculation, the loss will reach more than 300,000 yuan. Adding the losses of other provinces, the number is even more alarming. At a time when all industries are declining and rural areas are bankrupt, the electricity industry has been greatly affected. However, because it concerns public use and is closely related to factory production and social security, it can only be maintained with great pain, even if income cannot cover expenses. In Article 33 of Chapter 4 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the Political Tutelage Period, promulgated by the National Government on June 1, 1931, it is stated that in order to develop the people's livelihood, the state should provide encouragement and protection for the people's production enterprises. The telegram jointly issued by Chairman Jiang and President Wang also regards production and construction as the main task of saving the nation and seeking survival and calls on the people of the country to work together. It can be seen that they have a far-sighted view and are deeply concerned about the people's suffering. We are deeply grateful and grateful. Electric lights and electric heat are necessary for people's daily use, and electricity is necessary for various small industries and farmland irrigation. It can be seen that the electricity industry is completely used in the people's production enterprises. The Executive Yuan also issued an order in June 1930 to reduce and exempt exorbitant taxes and fees and support the development of the electricity industry. Now, the Ministry of Finance has suddenly increased the diesel fuel tax rate, making it impossible for power plants and people to bear the burden, and they will inevitably fall into a desperate situation. This is close to destroying industry and violating the Provisional Constitution, and we should ask for correction. According to the current tariff standards, from No. 244 to No. 254, all kinds of machines used in agriculture, industry, and commerce are taxed ad valorem when imported from foreign countries, and the regulations are from 5% to 7.5%. The original intention was that China's industry is still in its infancy, and machinery is a tool for encouraging production and developing industry. The aim is to reduce costs and promote it widely. The reduction of machinery tax is of profound significance, and diesel fuel is the fuel for driving machinery. Therefore, the tariffs previously levied were also similar to machinery tax. Now, the Ministry of Finance suddenly taxes thin diesel fuel at 70% of the ad valorem value. The previous and the latter contradict each other, which violates the tariff standards. Ignoring the difficulties of businesses and going against the trend is not acceptable to merchants. We should ask for correction. We found that the Legislative Yuan held its 46th meeting of the third session on February 9 of this year. Item 6 of the discussion items: The Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan suggested that the Legislative Yuan should consult with the Executive Yuan and issue an order to all provinces and cities to report all existing taxes and fees' names, methods, tax rates, tax revenue, start date, and reasons for collection to the Ministry of Finance before the end of June of this year, and then the Executive Yuan will transfer them to the Legislative Yuan for review. The resolution was: Pass the proposed opinions. Item 7: The Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan suggested that the Legislative Yuan should ask the National Government to issue an order to all central government agencies, and all taxes and fees collected and contracts concluded that have undergone legislative procedures should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for resolution before the end of April of this year to emphasize the spirit of the rule of law and conform to the government's orders. The resolution was: Pass the proposed opinions. Therefore, if the Ministry of Finance's heavy increase in the diesel fuel tax rate this time has not been reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan, it cannot be implemented according to law. We should ask for correction. Diesel fuel is a necessity for power plants, other small industries, and shipping. China currently has no mining and must rely on imports. Thick diesel fuel has too many impurities, which can easily damage machinery, and there is no stock on the market. Therefore, all power plants use thin diesel fuel to ensure the safety of machinery. It is heard that a small number of domestic merchants refine kerosene from this thin diesel fuel to profit from it, which hinders tax revenue. Therefore, a heavy tax is levied on thin diesel fuel to provide an invisible resistance. If this is the case, then to deal with the small number of oil refining merchants, it is advisable to formulate better methods and order local governments to strictly crack down, which is not difficult to clean up within the time limit. In this way, the government can still protect its original tax revenue. Otherwise, if the two are not distinguished, and the meal is abandoned due to choking, our legitimate power plants will be innocently harmed and fall into a hopeless situation, which is close to a suicidal policy. It is reported that the Shanghai shipping industry and the machine water lifting industry in the counties along the Jinghu Railway have successively appealed to withdraw the order. It is enough to prove that the implementation of this case is related to the rise and fall of agriculture, industry, and commerce throughout the country, especially the life and death of our electricity industry. We especially ask the Legislative Yuan to review and approve. It is hoped that the Legislative Yuan will take into account the difficulties of businesses and allow them to consult with the Executive Yuan to transfer to the Ministry of Finance to quickly tax the relevant thin diesel fuel tariffs at the same rate as thick diesel fuel to show fairness and protect the electricity industry. We are waiting for instructions and will comply. This is for public convenience. Respectfully presented to the President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun, Chairman of the Zhejiang Private Electricity Industry Association, Li Yanshi.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Accountants Association convened its 27th joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday at the association's office at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. The attending members were Wang Haifan, Yang Daxun, Li Wenjie, Ye Danian, Xie Lin, Xia Sunhuan, Xi Yushu, He Yuanming, and Zhao Zuwei. (1) The meeting began as scheduled. (2) Wang Haifan served as chairman. (3) Report items: A. Accountant Xie Lin sent a letter reporting that in February of last year, Lin was designated by the Shanghai First Special District Local Court as a plaintiff, Dun Yuzhuang, etc., to sue China Rubber Factory Co., Ltd. for debt. The court asked Lin to investigate whether the company was bankrupt and to report the time of bankruptcy. Lin immediately reviewed the issued accounts and made a detailed report. Subsequently, the Shanghai First Special District Local Court and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court ruled that the company and its chairman, Xu Zhishe, should jointly compensate the plaintiff for 11,000 silver dollars and its interest. However, Xu Zhishe, due to his defeat in the lawsuit, accused Lin of malicious intent in the criminal court of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, suing him for the crime of breach of trust. Lin immediately submitted a defense statement based on the facts and personally appeared in court twice on the 17th and 24th of this month. He was acquitted by the court on the 28th. Since Lin took office, he has personally studied and carefully handled the appraisal cases submitted by the court, because they are all related to the parties' debt responsibilities or criminal charges, and the entry and exit are extremely important. He has upheld the principles of justice, but unexpectedly there have been false accusations. Fortunately, the court was fair and acquitted him. However, because the newspapers have published a lot in recent days, he specially sent a letter to report the truth. The resolution was to file the report. (4) Discussion items: A. Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's No. 1249 approval, in accordance with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Instruction No. 2386, interpreted that if an accountant is hired by a commercial organization, the business solicited by the commercial organization in the name of the accountant is obviously contrary to the legal provisions, and it is also inconsistent with the nature of a freelance profession. The resolution was to notify all members to check and comply. B. Accountant Yang Daxun's letter, regarding the case of the liquidation of Dongtai Zhentaixiang Qianzhuang, after the association sent the case books to the Jiangsu Higher Court, the parties in the case have not gone through the disengagement procedures for more than a year. How should it proceed? Please make a public decision and instruction. The resolution was to send a letter to the Jiangsu Higher Court, informing the Dongtai County Government to transfer the information to the parties in the case, and immediately go to Accountant Yang to handle the disengagement procedures according to law. C. Members Gao Huai, Gong Zhaoqiu, etc. sent a letter requesting temporary withdrawal from the association. The resolution was to approve the withdrawal and send a letter urging Member Gao to pay the outstanding fees. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

<p>"Sister Flowers" Premiere Grandeur: The Star Film Company's latest production, the all-dialogue and song sound film "Sister Flowers," written and directed by Zheng Zhengqiu, starring Hu Die and others, took a year to produce. The script is rich in emotion and the story is full of twists and turns. Ms. Hu Die plays two roles in the film, and whether it is the actors' expressions, the director's skills, or the photography and sound recording, all have reached perfection. Therefore, since the film was released at the New Light Grand Theatre on the eve of the Lunar New Year, for the past eighteen days, there has not been a day or show that has not been sold out. According to statistics, the audience for "Sister Flowers" is already close to 100,000 people. Calculated based on the three million citizens of Shanghai, on average, one out of every thirty people has seen this film. The enthusiasm and welcome from the society are unprecedented for all Chinese and foreign films. Now, the Star Company and the New Light Grand Theatre, in order to thank the audience for their love and enthusiasm, plan to continue showing the film for several more days. As soon as "Sister Flowers" stops showing, the Star Company's blockbuster "Hua Shan Love History" will be released immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Reading Q&amp;A: A Further Discussion on Learning Language <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Since the last time I published an article "On Learning Language" (see this column on February 6, 7, and 8), many readers have written to question this issue. For example, Mr. Huang Lixiong asked:</p>
<p>(1) Is "prosody and timbre" only found in classical Chinese? Is it worth the effort for people who study new literature?</p>
<p>(2) How to appreciate "divine principle and flavor" and "masculine and feminine"?</p>
<p>(3) What are the benefits of studying classical Chinese?</p>
<p>(4) Is the current language consistent in speech and writing?</p>
<p>(5) Sometimes when I read other people's articles, I often encounter many adjectives or nouns, and I can't grasp their meaning, such as the words "divine principle and flavor" and "prosody and timbre." What is the remedy?</p>
<p>Mr. Tan Mengruo asked:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding national literature, according to you, modern people should study modern Chinese, but it is said that as a citizen of a country, one should understand or be able to read all historical records. The writings left by the ancients to later generations are like a concrete machine, which needs to be modified and integrated by later generations to form an independent style. Another saying is that the philosophers and scholars of the pre-Qin period are the seasonings, and the Twenty-Four Histories are the raw materials. Today, all new literature writers have read ancient books. So, is it necessary to read classical Chinese only to become an expert? If one only seeks to obtain and use ordinary writing, should one not bother to read classical Chinese, so as not to go around in circles?</p>
<p>The above questions can be summarized into three types: (1) Why shouldn't one start with classical Chinese when reading Chinese? (2) How to explain "prosody and timbre" and "divine principle and flavor"? (3) Is speech and writing consistent? The following are the answers:</p>
<p>(1) Why shouldn't one start with classical Chinese when reading Chinese?</p>
<p>This question has already been discussed last time, and I didn't want to say it again, but the general readers are still infatuated with classical Chinese, so I should simply state our reasons again.</p>
<p>First, we know that language is a medium for conveying thought. As long as the thought is explained, the tool for expressing the thought can be ignored. However, if there is a major change in thought and a major change in social organization, then the language, the medium for conveying thought, must also be changed. Because the old form cannot express the new thought at this time. Now our Chinese thought has undergone a major change under the influence of Europe and the United States, so there is the so-called "literary revolution," the reason for which is that the simple form and composition of the language cannot convey new thoughts. This is a fact, and it is also commonly felt by those who translate scientific books now. The translation of *The Wealth of Nations* by Yan Ji, which we mentioned last time, cannot express the original meaning clearly, is a very obvious example.</p>
<p>Second, from the perspective of the "words" used, we know that language is constantly undergoing the process of metabolism. On the one hand, it is creating new words and adding combined words; on the other hand, it is also eliminating old words. The reason is the same as mentioned above, that is, as human knowledge increases day by day, language must also expand accordingly, so the old words are felt to be insufficient and cannot be used as symbols of new concepts. On the other hand, many old concepts of the old era no longer exist in later generations, so those "words" that represent old concepts are gradually forgotten and gradually eliminated because they are not suitable. (Regarding this, readers can refer to Chen Wangdao's *An Outline of Rhetoric*, page 67, and Lu Simian's *Brief Explanation of Characters*, chapters on the reproduction and elimination of characters)</p>
<p>Third, the above two reasons are about the changes in language, and this is still the reason why we want to use modern Chinese. In other words, if readers read Chinese for practical purposes, they must read modern Chinese. What we want to point out now is, should learning modern Chinese start with classical Chinese? This is what readers are most doubtful about and urgently need an answer to. Why shouldn't readers start with classical Chinese when reading modern Chinese? The reason is this: Our language has undergone major changes in style, syntax, and word usage. It is very different from classical Chinese. Of course, the characters are still passed down from ancient times. Mr. Tan's letter compares classical Chinese to a machine, which is acceptable, but his explanation is wrong. If classical Chinese is an old machine, then modern Chinese is a new machine that has been greatly improved based on the old machine. True, the new machine is the successor of the old machine, the evolution of the old machine. However, people who learn to use machines do not necessarily need to start with learning to use old machines. Although the methods of using new machines are the same as those of old machines in some places, most of them are different. Therefore, people who know how to use old machines must also learn anew if they want to use new machines. Of course, his learning will be easier than those who have not learned to use machines, but this is not enough to be a lesson, because for those who do not know how to use either new or old machines, why bother to spend two steps to learn two methods of use? In order to use the new machine, he should directly learn the method of using the new machine. Many of the old machine usage methods are not needed on the new machine. What's the use of learning them? The reason why we advise people to learn Chinese from modern Chinese is this. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e195">Comments on Raising Silver Prices and China's Purchasing Power by Mu Jiaji <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The idea of the United States raising silver prices to increase the purchasing power of the Far East is something I have heard a lot about in recent years. Recently, this kind of noise has become louder and louder, with a great tendency to be implemented immediately. As for whether the implementation of raising silver prices can really increase the purchasing power of the Far East, how the Far East will be affected, and what defensive methods there will be, answering these kinds of questions is the mission of this article. First of all, two points need to be explained: (1) The so-called increasing the purchasing power of the Far East actually refers only to China, because India abandoned the silver standard in 1893, using silver internally and gold externally, so the level of silver prices does not have much impact on India. (2) The so-called raising of silver prices refers to the separate price of silver, and not to raising it at the same time as other prices. If silver prices and general prices are raised at the same time, it will not be very harmful to our country. For example, in the past few years, prices and silver prices fell at the same time, so the theoretical advantages and disadvantages are different from the facts. (See my book "Monetary Issues in China's Foreign Economy in the Last Four Years," published in the Central Bank Monthly Report, December 1933) In the years before this world economic panic, the economies of various countries were prosperous to the extreme. This phenomenon was most evident in the United States. At that time, there was a very popular name called "New Era," which meant that the economic situation at that time had reached a new era. From then on, they could only go on the golden road and would never return to the pain of pre-war economic cycles. Who knew that in 1929, New York stock prices fell sharply, and since then, all prices have fallen. Some people could not find the real cause of the panic and were at a loss. Some people thought that this phenomenon was only temporary and would not have a great impact. At the same time, some people took the opportunity to advocate that the reason for the decline in prices was mainly due to the fall in silver prices (in fact, since India implemented the sale of silver reserves in 1927, silver prices fell to the end of 1929 and then plummeted along with general prices). For example, Thomas W. Lamont, a famous New York banker, said in early 1930, "The main reason for the world economic panic is the lack of gold and the fall in silver prices." President Hoover said in his speech at the Cleveland Bank Association on October 2, 1930, analyzing the causes of the panic, "The purchasing power of China and India is determined by silver prices, and it has been greatly hit." This kind of argument was common in the first two years of the panic, but later, after considerable research on the causes of the panic, except for the silver faction and those related to Far Eastern business, this kind of argument gradually disappeared. Now, according to the facts, examining whether the fall in silver prices is a major cause of the economic panic, we can say in reverse whether raising silver prices is a countermeasure to save the panic. The following is a list of the percentage increase or decrease in the value of imports and exports of major countries in 1930 and 1931.</p>
<p>(1) Imports</p>
<p>Compared to 1929 Compared to 1930</p>
<p>1930 Increase (+) or Decrease (-) 1931 Increase (+) or Decrease (-)</p>
<p>(1) (1)</p>
<p>A. Calculated in silver (+) 3.6% (+) 4.4%</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>B. Calculated in gold (-) 27.0% (-) 20.0%</p>
<p>United States (-) 28.1% (-) 33.1%</p>
<p>United Kingdom (-) 13.9% (-) 16.7%</p>
<p>Japan (-) 30.5% (-) 19.9%</p>
<p>France (-) 9.8% (-) 19.6%</p>
<p>(2) Exports</p>
<p>Compared to 1929 Compared to 1930</p>
<p>1930 Increase (+) or Decrease (-) 1931 Increase (+) or Decrease (-)</p>
<p>(1) (1)</p>
<p>A. Calculated in silver (-) 11.8% (+) 1.6%</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>B. Calculated in gold (-) 34.0% (-) 25.0%</p>
<p>United States (-) 21.9% (-) 41.0%</p>
<p>United Kingdom (-) 21.8% (-) 31.8%</p>
<p>Japan (-) 31.9% (-) 21.8%</p>
<p>France (-) 14.7% (-) 28.9%</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, the value of our country's imported goods, calculated in silver, only increased and did not decrease. As for the value calculated in gold, it decreased by 27% in 1930 compared to 1929, and by 20% in 1931 compared to 1930. However, the imported goods of the United States and Japan also had the same decrease. There is another level that must be paid attention to, that is, although our country's population accounts for more than one-fifth of the world's population, the amount of foreign trade is often around 2.5% of the total value of world international trade. Therefore, our country's imports in 1930, calculated in gold, decreased by 27%, which actually only decreased by less than 1% in the entire world international trade (that is, 27% multiplied by 2.5%). The extent to which a decrease of less than 1% in the total world international trade will affect the world economic panic can be imagined. As for exports, the value of our country calculated in gold has shrunk almost more than any country in the table, which is inconsistent with the theoretical saying that the fall in silver prices can encourage exports. In fact, because our country is a country with insufficient production, and the prices of agricultural products have plummeted, and the overseas recession is the reason, exports have decreased a lot. From the above situation, it seems undoubtedly that the decline in silver prices is not a cause of this world economic panic. However, there are still silver factions and those related to Eastern business who are still singing the song of raising silver prices to increase the purchasing power of the Far East. Not only are they singing loudly, but they also have considerable power in the United States and may force the government to implement it. The following will try to describe what impact it will have on China after the silver price is actually raised. However, this matter is of great importance, and what is described is only a general overview. Before describing it, first clarify the two words "silver price." Before countries abandoned the gold standard, the so-called silver price referred to the value of silver calculated in gold, and our country's foreign exchange rate also fluctuated up and down within a considerable range with this price. After countries abandoned the gold standard, the so-called silver price refers to the value of silver calculated in paper currency. For example, the London silver price after the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard on September 21, 1931, refers to the value of silver calculated in paper pounds, and our country's exchange rate against the British pound also fluctuated up and down within a considerable range with this price. After other countries abandoned the gold standard, the same can be inferred. We must know that since countries abandoned the gold standard, the silver price (that is, the price of silver calculated in paper pounds or paper dollars) and our country's foreign exchange rate have already increased a lot, especially in the past year. In other words, after countries abandoned the gold standard, the foreign value of their paper currency naturally fell, and the result was that our country's currency value was diligently raised. This situation has been going on for one or two years. Understanding the impact that our country has suffered in the past one or two years, we can infer the impact after the silver price is raised again. The most noteworthy point is that our country is a silver-using country, not a silver-producing country, so since 1910, except for the period of the European War, it has imported a large amount of silver every year. However, last year was like the situation during the European War, when the foreign silver price was higher than the domestic silver price, and our country actually became an exporter of silver, with a value of about 50 million yuan. We still remember that in 1930 and 1931, the foreign silver price plummeted, causing the domestic silver price to be higher than the foreign silver price, and a large amount of cash silver flowed into our country. This phenomenon (that is, an object runs from a market with a low price to a market with a high price), if not stopped, can flow out like water going downhill. In the past one or two years, silver has been exported a lot due to the attraction of high prices abroad. If the silver price is raised again, the export of silver will inevitably be greater than last year. The impact of a non-silver-producing silver-using country exporting a large amount of cash silver on the national economy is naturally very great and can be self-evident. After the silver price is raised, in addition to the export of silver, the impact on our country's import and export goods will also be significant. Now countries are suffering from overproduction, while our country is suffering from insufficient production. After the silver price is raised, the surplus goods of foreign countries will again use our country as the tail, and a large number of them will be imported. According to the facts in the past one or two years, it can be proved that, according to the author's observation, our country's economic panic did not start in 1929, but at the end of 1931 when countries abandoned the gold standard. Of course, after 1931, our country's economy was greatly hit by the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, but the dumping of foreign goods, which was unheard of before 1931 and has been reported in newspapers every day since then, is also a major reason (most of which is currency dumping). If the silver price is raised again, the wave of bankruptcies of our country's industrial and commercial enterprises may be even worse than today. There will also be extremely unfavorable effects on exports, because our country's overseas markets have been taken away by others. After the silver price is raised again, the value of our country's exports calculated in gold must also be raised. Therefore, the sales of our country's export commodities abroad will be further reduced. The result of raising the silver price is like this. The so-called increase in the purchasing power of the Far East is not only impossible, but it will also cause greater damage to our country's economy, and the purchasing power will inevitably be further reduced. So, how can purchasing power be increased? Only by increasing production, because currency is only a medium of exchange. If there are more outputs, there must also be more inputs to balance it. This is the case for both individuals and countries. It is not possible to supplement the purchasing power of a country by raising or lowering the value of a country's currency. Therefore, the production conference that is about to be held is shouldering a major mission. The impact of raising silver prices on our country has been described above. For the sake of self-defense, our country has to take decisive measures. First, we should impose heavy taxes on or even prohibit the import of imported goods that are harmful to or unnecessary for our country's inherent or future industrial and commercial enterprises, so as to avoid the bankruptcy of domestic industrial and commercial enterprises. We must recognize that this kind of currency dumping tax does not increase the burden on consumers, but aims to maintain the balance of domestic prices. Second, banning silver exports within a considerable period of time is also an inevitable step to prevent the outflow of cash silver. Finally, judging from the current situation, there should be a permanent organization to study the silver issue, because as long as our country does not break away from the silver standard, the silver price issue is indeed a personal issue. There should be a permanent organization to continue the research, so as to avoid making hasty decisions when the time comes.</p>

Upon receiving the news, Chairman Chiang immediately telegraphed his acceptance. With the congress approaching, preparations are actively underway.

<h3 id="e204">Zhejiang University Plans to Build New School Buildings <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>All to be Completed Within Four Years</p>
<p>Total Cost of 1.2 Million</p>
<p>Zhejiang University finds its existing campus on Daxue Road too small and inadequate. Furthermore, as it is surrounded by residential buildings, expansion is difficult. Therefore, there is a proposal to move the entire university to a centralized location outside Taiping Gate for construction. The new site has now been surveyed and determined. Construction of the College of Agriculture building is scheduled to begin in March and be completed by the end of September. The cost of its laboratories, classrooms, dormitories, and other buildings is estimated to be 300,000 yuan. After the completion of the College of Agriculture building, the remaining buildings will be constructed in order. It is said that the university's construction plan is divided into two phases. The first phase includes the Mathematics and Physics Building, Biology Building, Chemistry Building, Agriculture Building, and Library, which are to be completed within four years, with an estimated cost of 1.2 million yuan. The second phase includes the Auditorium, Gymnasium, Office Building, Infirmary, Faculty and Staff Dormitories, Student Dormitories, and Dining Hall, which will commence after the completion of the first phase. As for the construction funds, in addition to striving to tighten budgets internally, the university will also request subsidies from the central government and various agencies.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Jiangsu Provincial Yancheng Middle School Keen on Construction <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Since Wu Dezhang took over as headmaster of Jiangsu Provincial Yancheng Middle School last autumn, many improvements have been made, and the school's reputation in society has been growing daily. Detailed information has already been reported in various newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai. However, as the school was founded not long ago, its history is still shallow, and its facilities are simple and makeshift in many respects. Headmaster Wu deeply believes that the excellence of students' academic performance, in addition to serious teaching and strict discipline, also requires attention to facilities, as the environment is quite sufficient to influence students' interest in learning. Therefore, in addition to building a laboratory last autumn, the school's campus, except for the city wall on the east side serving as a barrier, only has ditches as natural boundaries on the south, west, and north sides. However, the narrow stream of water gradually dries up after autumn, not only is the defense insufficient, but also the management is hampered by the lack of strictness. Therefore, during the winter vacation, based on the above two reasons, he submitted a request to the Education Department for funds to build a wall, which has been approved and construction has begun, and will be completed soon. Furthermore, as the school still lacks a self-study room, special classrooms, a covered playground, and an auditorium, preparations are also underway to formulate plans and submit requests for construction, prioritizing the most urgent needs, to ensure that the facilities are substantial and the environment is beautiful, so as to suit the students' concentrated study. In addition, the school is also gradually realizing its plans to purchase a large batch of books, build an animal pavilion, and develop a goldfish pond, all of which can beautify the campus and entertain the mind and body. This shows Wu's keen determination to build and reform education.</p>

He had two expectations for the performers: (1) They must unite and learn from each other to make this career more and more advanced.

<p>Mr. Ottmann, Dean of Studies at the Attached High School of National Tongji University, returned to Germany for convalescence last year due to cancer and unfortunately passed away in Göttingen in December. Details were previously published in this newspaper. The school deeply mourned his death, as Mr. Ottmann had taught for over a decade with tireless dedication. A memorial service was held on the morning of February 28th to express their grief. Attendees included the German Consul-General, Director of the Public Works Bureau Shen Junyi, all the Chinese and German professors and students, and over a thousand friends of Mr. Ottmann. Dr. Weng Zhilong, the president of the university, delivered a speech, stating that Mr. Ottmann was loyal to his duties, diligent in his work, and admired by his colleagues. He was enthusiastic about the expansion and equipment of Tongji University. His efforts during the January 28th Incident, his appeals, and his rescue plans were particularly moving. In addition to his studies in literature and philosophy, he was also proficient in linguistics and could speak English, French, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and various Indian languages. He was particularly interested in Chinese language and literature and had made profound achievements. He had written books such as "Common Spoken Language of Northern China" and the "German-Chinese Dictionary." The "German-Chinese Dictionary" was a significant contribution to literature. Unfortunately, the manuscript was submitted to the Commercial Press during the January 28th Incident and was destroyed. Since then, no one has continued his work. Mr. Ottmann had a deep understanding of Confucian doctrines and promoted Chinese culture to Europe. Mr. Ottmann can be regarded as a leader in this field. Therefore, his death is not only a great loss to Tongji University, but it is also closely related to the communication of Chinese and German culture. Finally, he said that our commemoration of Mr. Ottmann is not only a mourning, but also a memorial to express our eternal grief, which will be discussed further. Afterwards, the German Consul-General, the deans of the medical and engineering colleges, the director of the attached high school, representatives of the faculty and staff, representatives of the students, representatives of the German-Austrian-Swiss Alumni Association, and representatives of the Tongji Alumni Association, Shen Junyi, and Chen Heming delivered speeches, followed by a thank-you speech by a representative of the family.</p>

<p>Also Holding Household Affairs Lectures and Children's Gift Exhibition</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Yutang Civil Education Center in Maqiao, Shanghai County, in order to awaken the attention of parents in rural areas to the education and care of their children, held a children's health competition for the past two days, and also held household affairs lectures and children's gift exhibitions. Rural women and children participated enthusiastically. During this competition, special attention was paid to children's physical examinations. The examination items were divided into five categories: facial features, head, chest, abdominal organs, limbs, nutritional status, diseases, and cleanliness. Dr. Niu Wangsheng, a famous doctor in Shanghai, was specially invited to serve as the examiner. Dr. Niu is an American who has served as a doctor at the Shanghai Women and Children's Hospital for many years and has profound medical skills. The chronic diseases of most rural children were found by her. After the examination, treatment was given at the center's public clinic. Therefore, this competition is very different from the general observation of children's appearance. Many awards were donated by various organizations, such as the silk banner from the Ministry of Education, the silver shield from Mayor Wu and the Provincial Party Headquarters, the mirror frame from the Songhu County Government Education Bureau, and books, milk, and food donated by various bookstores and organizations. In addition to special awards for outstanding children, all others were given awards and encouragement. Mr. Niu Ti and his wife specially awarded Cai Yuehan, the most outstanding child (because he is from a poor peasant family), two yuan in cash as encouragement to parents in general. It is also reported that after this competition, the center will conduct a general examination of all children in the basic education area every spring as a foundation for improving national fitness.</p>

<p>The Japanese Tennis Association has already appointed Taro Sato, Eikichi Ito, Hajime Eboshi, Kengo Yamada, and Yasuo Murakami as representatives, without holding preliminary selections. Among the five, only Taro Sato has attended the Davis Cup. The rest are mostly newcomers. Because this year's Far Eastern Games conflicts with the Davis Cup, the Japanese are forced to use second-rate players for the Far Eastern tennis championship.</p>

<p>The Japanese Athletic Association held a committee meeting on the 28th in the afternoon to discuss the issue of Manchuria's participation in the Far Eastern Games. As a result, it was decided that the Athletic Association would continue its efforts. The specific method is to report to Count Baladur, President of the International Olympic Committee, that China's refusal to allow Manchuria to participate in the Games has political implications, which violates the spirit of sports. They will also request the assistance of the Olympic Committee and send powerful representatives to China to persuade them on this issue.</p>

<p>The Goalpost Falls and the Ball Enters the Goal</p>
<p>Explanation from the British Referees Association</p>
<p>(Reuters, London) Recently, the British Football Committee received a report from the Referees Association at a meeting regarding the interpretation of Article 4 of the football regulations, which was requested by the Westlaw Association. The article is as follows:</p>
<p>"During the game, if the goalpost falls due to any accident, the referee may award a goal if, in his opinion, the ball would have passed under the goalpost if it had not fallen."</p>
<p>The Referees Association stated that only if the goalpost falls and, in the referee's opinion, the ball would have passed under the goalpost at that time if it had not fallen, then the referee has the right to award a goal. If the goalpost falls and cannot be reinstalled, then the game is canceled.</p>

<p>Total Distance of 15,079 Meters</p>
<p>Champion Zhao Hui's Time: 58 Minutes 51 Seconds</p>
<p>(Guangzhou Dispatch) The annual Guangzhou City Ring Road Public Race was held for the fifth time this year on the 24th in the bright spring sunshine. The Provincial Sports Committee had made thorough arrangements beforehand, and hospitals were requested to send ambulance teams to escort the runners along the route. Scouts and military police from various schools were dispatched to maintain order along the route. When the long-distance runners passed, traffic was temporarily stopped, and pedestrians were not allowed to cross at major intersections. Dozens of stations were set up along the route, with two to three judges stationed at each station to maintain order. If an athlete stopped during the race, the judges and guards had the right to confiscate their number. The confiscated numbers were reported to the judges at the finish line, and the offending athletes were taken to the escort vehicle and not allowed to continue the race. The starting and finishing points of the race were both at the Provincial Public Sports Field in the eastern suburbs. Citizens flocked to watch the race. A horizontal banner reading "Fifth Guangzhou Public City Ring Road Race" was hung in front of the venue. At around 11:00 AM, the athletes who had registered gathered at the venue. The starter, Qiu Jixiang, gathered the male champion Zhao Hui and female champion Gao Xiaodie, checked their numbers, explained the precautions for the race to the athletes, and finally called their names one by one. There were 188 male athletes and 4 female athletes. After the roll call, the chairman of the meeting, Xie Yingzhou, fired the starting gun, and the athletes set off. They first ran three laps around the track in the Public Sports Field, and then set off on the avenue. The Public Security Bureau inspectors led the way in a tram. The streets were crowded with spectators, and the scouts and military police maintained order very well. After the athletes had passed, traffic was restored to that section of the road. The route started from Dadong Road and passed through Huiai Road, Fengning Road, Lupai Road, Cunshan Road, Shiwufu Road, Datong Road, 623 Road, Xiti, Taiping South Road, Yide Road, Taikang Road, Wanfu Road, Yuexiu South Road, Baiyun Road, Dongchuan Road, and back to Dadong Road Public Sports Field, where they ran one more lap around the track to determine the winner. The entire course was 30.92 li, equivalent to 15,079 meters. On the day of the race, the athletes initially conserved their strength, and the distances between them were small. As they ran past the halfway point, those who could not keep up gradually dropped out, and more than half were eliminated. By the time they reached Yide Road, one of the female athletes was exhausted and fainted. The ambulance team rescued her and put her on the vehicle. As they approached Baiyun Road, the stronger male athletes began to exert themselves. Zhao Hui, a student from Zhongshan University and a former champion, used his remaining strength to move forward, advancing from the sixteenth or seventeenth position to the front. Huang Zhizhong, an athlete from the 8th Division, who had been leading the way, was overtaken by Zhao. Although Huang struggled to catch up, it was too late. Soon after, when they ran back to the Public Sports Field, Zhao Hui was still in the lead, with the correct posture. When he reached the finish line, the timekeeper announced that the race time was 58 minutes 51.4 seconds. Huang Zhizhong (athlete from the 8th Division of the 3rd Army), the second-place winner, arrived shortly after, with a time of 59 minutes 15 seconds. Zhou Feng (athlete from the 7th Division of the 3rd Army) came in third, Liu Biao (athlete from the Police Fire Brigade) came in fourth, and Xu Guoping (athlete from the Headquarters Military Band) came in fifth. Ten minutes after the first-place winner arrived, thirty-four athletes had reached the finish line. Sixty-one athletes were able to run the entire course. The female champion Gao Xiaodie's time was 84 minutes 47 seconds. The runner-up was Li Xuehua, and the third-place winner was Lan Qianqiong. The above three female athletes are all students from physical education schools. After the rankings were determined, the chairman, Xie Yingzhou, gave a speech to the winners, and then presented the awards on the spot. After that, a football performance was held to celebrate. The opposing teams were Lingnan School and the Air Force. The performance was very exciting. The event ended at around 3:00 PM. The past results are attached below:</p>
<p>1920: Zhao Hui, 11,338 meters, 45 minutes</p>
<p>1921: Zhao Hui, 13,248 meters, 50 minutes 16.3 seconds</p>
<p>1922: Yuan Yucheng, 15,079 meters, 57 minutes 24.4 seconds</p>
<p>1923: Zhao Hui, 15,079 meters, 58 minutes 20 seconds</p>

<h3 id="e234">Praising the Dead <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Be Careful What You Say</p>
<p>The Chinese have a habit of liking to put on a show for the dead. An ordinary person, after their death, is often praised as if they were a truly remarkable figure. For example, large obituaries that are more than two or three inches thick, grand funerals that block an entire road, and opening memorial halls and holding Taoist ceremonies for every seventh day after death are all, strictly speaking, ways of praising the dead. However, because the praiser and the praised are either father and son or husband and wife, there is always some kind of familial relationship. Therefore, even though those on the sidelines know that this is obviously a case of "farting after the horse passes," using the praising of the dead as a pretext to promote oneself, it doesn't feel too nauseating. The most nauseating thing is when a group of unrelated people, after the peaceful death of someone who is seemingly famous but actually unknown, follow the lead of a few people who have a slight relationship with the deceased and publish articles praising them or her in the newspaper day and night.</p>
<p>Although this trend has been around for a long time, it has become even worse now!</p>
<p>A certain poet died, and before his death, absolutely no one mentioned him. After his death, many publications actually put out special issues for him. Perhaps the editors of these publications had repeatedly rejected the poet's submissions with extremely cold faces while he was alive! Perhaps because the poet was not as famous as Xu Zhimo, many people were "using the word 'poet'" to mock him while he was alive. After his death, these many people immediately changed their tone and used terms such as "my friend" or "China's modern poet" to sincerely write articles praising him!</p>
<p>Recently, Ai Xia, a film actress who was not very famous during her lifetime and only occasionally wrote a few articles, died. As soon as this news spread, articles praising the dead appeared in newspapers like a tidal wave. If someone were to cut them all out and print a "Book of Condolences," I think it would be at least as thick as the Shen Bao Yearbook. And from then on, Ai Xia's reputation would almost surpass that of Hu Die and Chen Yumei, but she is already dead!</p>
<p>It is precisely because this person is dead that we want to praise them. It is precisely because this person is already dead that they will no longer be an obstacle to us, so we can praise them without fear!</p>
<p>Alas! Cold-hearted people! Why are you unwilling to give a person some more substantial help while they are alive?</p>
<h3 id="e235">The Mystery of Prophecy <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>"Prophecy" has almost become an unfathomable mystery. If you don't believe it and dismiss it as decadent and declining Chinese scholarship and the idle words that emerge from intellectual turmoil, then what about foreign figures like H.G. Wells, Smuts, Arthur Balfour, and others who are universally recognized as "prophecy experts"? They are even revered as "saints of prophecy," which shows that it is not without basis. However, the shallow-minded are lurking in a state of ignorance and confusion, unable to awaken. Therefore, they never know any catastrophe beforehand, but only understand when disaster strikes, and then it is too late to avoid it!</p>
<p>I will leave aside major world events such as wars and focus on the current puppet state of Manchuria. Isn't it said that a Mr. Puyi will usurp the throne on March 1st? Alas! This matter reminds me of when Empress Dowager Longyu issued the edict of abdication in the ×th month of the first year of the Republic of China. Puyi had been on the throne for only three years, twelve months, and five days. From the entry of his ancestor, Emperor Taizu of the Qing dynasty, into China, he had ruled China for a total of ten generations, spanning 268 years. Until Puyi's abdication, that was the end of the Qing dynasty. The Jue Luo clan's demise can be considered an unprecedented occurrence since ancient times! But unexpectedly, the September 18th Incident occurred, and after the Japanese invaders occupied Liaoning and Jilin, figures such as Doihara, Zheng Xiaoxu, Jin Liang, Xi Qia, and Zhang Hai Peng appeared. Puyi was originally lying low in Zhang Yuan, playing tennis and not stepping out of Tianjin. Hey! Now he had to go to Dalian to take up this task. Although he was under the control of the Japanese puppet organization, he was naturally willing to fall into their trap to relive his imperial dream.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I met an old friend who returned from outside the customs. He said that this Mr. Puyi would soon usurp the throne. He believed that this was consistent with two lines from the prophecy of the "Yellow Bitter Gourd Zen poem": "Jiantong dwells in a small corner for thirty-six years, watching the blood like hemp beyond the border." "Jiantong" is the Xuantong era. At first, the Japanese Doihara and others wanted to establish a "Mingguang Empire" in the three northeastern provinces, but they were unsuccessful. After they took Puyi out of the customs, today they have the "Kangde" reign. "Thirty-six" corresponds to the World War, which must begin in 1936. At that time, the so-called puppets in Manchuria, like wooden dummies, will be manipulated by others and correspond to the blood like hemp beyond the border. The only way out is to sit and wait for death. There is no other way. To expect to be as safe as during the fall of the Qing dynasty, hey! That is truly dreaming in the dark! Although these words are close to the talk of prophecy experts, a careful examination reveals some precognitive predictions. I am afraid that they will not be able to escape this fate!</p>

<p>— Zhang Bingduo</p>
<p>Locked tightly by the chains of life, almost suffocating, with tens of bushels of burdens weighing down on my whole body, when I look at my face in a broken old mirror, the yellow-black skin, the thin cheekbones, the hair so disheveled, the pupils in the two sunken eyes so lifeless and weak, I never thought that after only three to five months of floating and struggling in the city, I would unconsciously lose my former handsome appearance.</p>
<p>In this era, literati are cheaper than a tail-wagging dog begging for food. Poverty and despair, an excess of knowledge cannot be exchanged for a fried dough stick or half a loaf of bread. I rack my brains and pour out my heart and soul to write articles, and after finally getting them published, I receive eight or nine yuan a month, which is barely enough to eat. I still have to pay for postage, laundry, haircuts... Indeed, life is really hard!</p>
<p>Every day, regardless of whether it is sunny or rainy, and at dusk, writing articles under a dim light is such a painful and unbearable thing. But if I don't write, my stomach will panic. Writing means pouring out my heart and soul every day, which is truly unspeakable suffering. And where will I get so much material? In addition, the so-called modern ladies next door, who have nothing to do after filling their stomachs, are always humming a series of seductive tunes, disturbing my mind so that it cannot be clear. At night, the Shanghai opera on the radio will be noisy until twelve o'clock, and the sound of cars speeding by reminds me of the sighs and curses I have for the leisure class. I cannot continue to write.</p>
<p>In this era, literati have fallen to the most unfortunate and lowest point. The pampered dog sitting next to the young master and young lady may have a more comfortable and stable life. In fact, if it weren't for a little bit of meager payment to maintain my life and prolong my existence, who would be patient enough to happily pour out their heart and soul to win a little appreciation from the leisure class!</p>

<h3 id="e238">Common Sense on Saving Electricity <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>After the American scientist Thomas Edison invented the electric light in 1879 in the Western calendar, it soon spread around the world. Now even the slightly larger cities in our country have traces of it. Especially in the most prosperous Shanghai, we spend every night with it, and it has become one of our daily necessities. Moreover, the monthly electricity bill is a major daily expense, just like the water bill, and we certainly need to find ways to save on it. Now I will write down the three methods I know separately below for the readers' reference.</p>
<p>1. Check the Voltage</p>
<p>The voltage of each light bulb is marked with numbers on the bulb's base. Commonly used ones are 200 volts because the voltage of the incoming wires is also the same, which is specified by the transformer. If the voltage of the light bulb is too low, the filament is easily burned out. If the voltage is too high, the light will not be bright. Therefore, it is best to use a 200-volt light bulb, which has strong light and is also cost-effective.</p>
<p>2. Replace the Light Bulb</p>
<p>Ordinary light bulbs lose their effectiveness after being used for eight or nine months (assuming four hours of use per day). This is because the filament is burned out by the high heat generated by the electric current. However, after five months, the filament has gradually dissolved into vapor and attached to the bulb, making the light dimmer day by day. At this time, it is necessary to add more lights to restore the previous brightness. The added electricity bill is consumed by the old bulb. Therefore, it is very cost-effective to replace the light bulb after five or six months of use.</p>
<p>3. Use Half-Watt Bulbs</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, ordinary light bulbs become dim after being used for a certain period of time. However, there is now a way to remedy this. That is, by injecting nitrogen or argon gas into the vacuum bulb, the filament can be melted more slowly. This kind of bulb is called a nitrogen bulb or an argon bulb. Also, because this light bulb only needs half a watt of electricity per candlepower, it is also called a Half-Watt Lamp. Various electrical stores in Shanghai sell them. Although the price is about twice as expensive as ordinary bulbs, they are very durable and save a lot of electricity. For example, when using a 200-volt ordinary bulb and a half-watt bulb, each consuming 100 watts of electricity, the ordinary bulb can only emit 87 candlepower, while the half-watt bulb can emit 200 candlepower, which is more than twice the light power of the ordinary bulb. Therefore, using half-watt bulbs is indeed a very electricity-saving thing.</p>
<p>The above three methods are all things I have tried and they are very effective. Please feel free to try them as well. If you install a few light bulbs at home, the savings are of course limited. However, if you install dozens or hundreds of light bulbs, the amount will be very large. This is also a way to reduce spending in household economics.</p>

<p>— Zou Ronghe</p>
<p>Many of the people in Chinese society who are unemployed and complaining are young people; however, the people who can achieve something are also only young people. Therefore, we came forward in the past to organize a Living Society. Now I will write down our present and future below, hoping to be corrected. There are a total of ten of us. Five of us are temporarily teachers. We each receive 15 yuan from our earnings as living expenses, and the rest is used as capital. For the five months from April, we now have a rented house, six mu of rented fields, one head of yellow cattle, two boxes of bees, and more than a hundred chickens of various sizes. We plan to use all of our teaching income as capital after the autumn of next year. Three years later, all of us will join in, from farming to forestry. Five years later, our parents, younger siblings can also join in to do chores like tending fire and herding livestock. After ten years, we should have more than 20,000 yuan of capital that is worth investing. Now I will write down the general idea of ​​the organization.</p>
<p>Each person only has living expenses and no salary.</p>
<p>Except for unavoidable expenses, all food and accommodation are made by ourselves.</p>
<p>Each person spends two hours reading and half an hour teaching the children in the village and neighborhood.</p>
<p>Within five years, one person will visit industries in the country in order to develop them.</p>
<p>After ten years, we can provide funds for studying abroad.</p>
<p>Each year, each person plants hundreds of camphor trees and investigates the local mineral resources.</p>
<p>We hope that all the weak young people in the country will practice this and become useful farmers.</p>

<p>Chapter 25: Tearful faces bid farewell to family and return to distant garrison / Wind and sand fill the night as they leave the border and station in a lonely city</p>
<p>When Ziqiang turned his head, he realized that his father and mother-in-law had both come to see him off at the gate. At this point, no matter how tough Ziqiang's heart was, he couldn't just ignore them. He had to turn around and run back to his father, bowing to the old man and saying, "Don't see me off, father. I will be fine." As he spoke, he saw some dust on his father's shoulder, so he reached out and gently patted his father's shoulder. Zhao Weng held his dry tobacco pipe, looked at him, coughed twice, and nodded, saying, "Alright, go ahead." Jiang stood by the door frame, holding her own collar, and said to Ziqiang, "Son-in-law, take care of yourself. I will take care of things at home." What else could Ziqiang say? He only pressed his hands to his chest and kept bowing to everyone. Guizhi was still standing far ahead, calling out, "Hurry to the station, don't miss the time." Ziqiang was an old soldier, and he had already developed the habits of a soldier. At this time, he was outside the gate, so he naturally straightened his chest and gave a military salute. Then he stood upright, turned around, and left. This time he was determined and didn't turn his head back to look. Guizhi followed behind, walking with big steps, counting "one, two, three, four" in her mouth. Their house was not far from the long-distance bus station, only one turn away. When he stopped, Guizhi smiled and said, "You are a soldier, how can you be so indecisive? At the time of parting, you just kept pulling and tugging." Ziqiang sighed, immediately straightened his chest again, and smiled, "You are right, we must show some manly demeanor." Xiaolin put his luggage down beside him and suddenly asked, "Company Commander, are you rushing back to Xifengkou this time because there is going to be a battle soon?" How could Ziqiang answer this question? Even Guizhi knew in her heart that this might be the case in reality, but she always hoped that it wouldn't be so, so she went around and around, and never said such a thing. (325)</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3 id="e241">Knife and Pen <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Ran</p>
<p>An Indian revolutionary once asked someone from × country: "Did you conquer India with a knife or a pen? If with a pen, then India can strive for freedom; if with a knife, then even if India is not martial, it can still strive for freedom by breaking bones as weapons." Wise words!</p>
<p>These words are very sad! Under heavy oppression and restraint, hope gradually turns from big to small, and from small to nothing. In the hopelessness of despair, many great hearts turn to ashes, and boiling blood turns to cold blood. However, after the hermit Rādha went into meditation for several years, he was suddenly shaken awake by someone using a method. At this time, he ascended into the void, making great divine transformations, setting himself on fire, and even the dead ashes and cold blood disappeared. This became a precedent for many reformers.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to answer this kind of desperate cry. It is neither a knife nor a pen, but rather to create preparations for India to obtain freedom. This kind of talk can be perfunctory for a while and can lull children back to sleep. Whatever kind of Chinese thing it is, Westerners only need to add the words "leased territory" to make us feel at peace. In short, the great benevolence and righteousness of × country is nothing more than temporarily managing India for the Indians.</p>
<p>But what is the answer? From an outsider's point of view, both knife and pen are used. For example, the murderer is the knife; the charges after the murder are the pen. The announcement of punishment is the pen; the mobilization of troops is the knife. After × country uses military methods to conquer India, it must use literary methods to manage it. At this time, of course, there will be various great principles that should be obeyed by the people of × country, either hypnotizing, or anesthetizing, or adopting a pessimistic view. What if they still don't submit to the rule under these circumstances? It's very simple, use the knife again. Just like when a child wakes up at night and doesn't want to sleep, the adult should try to coax them to sleep. What if the coaxing skills are exhausted? Then hit them.</p>
<p>However, it is still not very effective. Historically, one can always see rotating changes, and rarely see a consistent linear progression. The old saying goes that people and heaven are closely connected. Since heaven is endless, then the human heart is also endless. After turning into a state of sadness or heartbreak, breaking bones can be used as weapons, and self-strangulation can also be done. This further proves the immeasurability of heaven's will and the human heart, and that the world has never been calm.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Talking About "Taiping Song" <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>The "Lantern Festival" has arrived, which can't help but remind me of the "Taiping Song" in my hometown.</p>
<p>In my childhood, two kinds of local art gave me a deep impression. One was donkey shadow puppetry, and the other was "Taiping Song". Of course, drum songs and scripts also gave me considerable interest, but "Taiping Song" and donkey shadow puppetry gave me a stronger impression. This may be because the local and popular nature of these two things is relatively strong.</p>
<p>During festivals, these two things give the people great happiness. It is not limited to towns, but is widespread to various villages. In terms of responding to the festive season, donkey shadow puppetry can be performed at any time, while "Taiping Song" can only be sung during the first month of the lunar year. Perhaps it is a kind of performance to welcome the spring. When performing donkey shadow puppetry and singing "Taiping Song", the villages are really crowded and extremely lively. In the summer of 1930, I also watched the last donkey shadow puppetry in Jiangnan, Jilin Provincial City, but the audience was not as enthusiastic as before. As for "Taiping Song", because of "leaving my hometown at a young age", I have not had the opportunity to appreciate it for more than twenty years.</p>
<p>Donkey shadow puppetry is also known as Luanzhou shadow puppetry. It was probably transplanted to "Guandong City" by Luanzhou merchants. In the past, 90% of the Northeast's commerce was in the hands of people from Changli, Laoting, Luanzhou, and Funing counties. So, donkey shadow puppetry can be regarded as a foreign art in the Northeast. "Taiping Song" is a native art of the Northeast. According to my friend Mr. Hu, shadow puppetry is an art of the Luanhe River basin, while "Taiping Song" is an art of the Liaohe River basin.</p>
<p>"Taiping Song" is also known as "Yangge". Villagers say "sing Yangge". When written on paper, it is "Taiping Song". At the beginning of the New Year, people who are "competitive" start preparing for "Yangge". Naturally, this requires the support of gentry and rich people. After the land is harvested, the grain is sold, and what is stored is stored. When a year of work is completed, during the celebration of the New Year, those competitive people who like to help others organize "Yangge troupes" to celebrate the future year of "longevity and abundance". "Yangge" is a costumed parade dance. Responding to the rhythm of the music of gongs, drums, cymbals, and nao, thirty or twenty people, or forty or fifty people, dressed in various costumes of men, women, old and young, make a circle, walking and dancing in circles. At a certain interval of time, periodically, the band stops the music, the dancers stop jumping, and one person comes out from the line, opens a fan, faces upwards, and sings a "Yangge tune" like a seven-character quatrain. When the first three sentences are sung, a burst of music is played. When the last sentence is sung, it is music and dance again.</p>
<p>During the lively season, "Yangge" is "performing" in the center of the street or village, and the audience is naturally surrounding it. In general times, "Yangge" circulates through various shops and families, and the audience follows behind, walking around to watch. In the courtyards of each family, "Yangge" performs, dances, and sings for about ten minutes or twenty minutes, depending on the situation. The songs sung are mostly congratulations to the shops for making money and the gentry and rich people for the prosperity of their families. For the families of officials, of course, they celebrate promotion, and for the local gentry and rich people, they celebrate a year of abundance. The gentry and merchants usually give generous rewards.</p>
<p>In the costumes of "Yangge", there is "Old Tartar", wearing a foreign fur robe backwards, with copper jingle bells on his body, and "Big-footed Wife", who is a man dressed as a woman, like a middle-aged woman. There are others, but I can't remember.</p>
<p>Many of the "Yangge tunes" are readily available, such as "In the Twelfth Month" and "Picking Tea in the Twelfth Month", etc. The form is mostly four sentences of seven characters. However, there are also newly made ones, which the singer improvises according to the occasion. Let me write down a few that I remember:</p>
<p>"Entering the gate and looking up, I see the lantern pole above, on the lantern pole are four big characters, (music) abundant harvest and peaceful year."</p>
<p>"Cherries are delicious but the tree is hard to plant, Yangge is good to sing but the mouth is hard to open, to eat cherries you have to spend money to buy them, (music) to sing Yangge you have to smear your face."</p>
<p>"In the first month, the first month is right, Bai Ma Yin Qiang Xiao Luocheng, everyone says Luocheng is small, (music) night fight Denzhou to save Qin Qiong."</p>
<p>"In the second month, the dragon raises its head, the Emperor Wansui comes to use the ox, the Queen Mother comes to deliver food, (music) whip the plough ox for ten thousand years of harvest."</p>
<p>"Entering the gate, dong dong dong, your old courtyard is like Beijing, the main room is like the Golden Luan Palace, (music) the courtyard wall is like the Forbidden City."</p>
<p>The first four songs are readily available, and the last one is improvised.</p>
<p>Seeing Mr. Zheng Zhenduo's "Ancient Book Discovery in 1933" mentioned "shadow words", I thought of this folk art "Yangge tune" in the Liaohe River basin, and felt that this rich treasure trove is worthy of the attention of scholars and literati. The arrival of the "Lantern Festival" further makes me feel the need to arouse people's attention to this treasure trove. I don't know if there is also this kind of "Taiping Song" in other provinces in the mainland. However, in the future, after the Liaohe River basin falls into the hands of the Yi Di, perhaps the trampling of iron hooves will cause this kind of literature and art to perish, so that it will be lost. We should collect "Yangge tunes" as soon as possible. The difficulty is that this kind of thing does not seem to have a copy. Most of it still relies on oral transmission.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Gurkha <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Gurkha is an important place on the border between Yunnan and Burma, located in the Savage Mountains. Going south from the Luanxian Street of Qianya Dam in Yunnan, it takes half a day's walk through the mountains to reach it. There, there are no streets, no villages, only a small mountain ditch, flowing out of the mountains with green trees and verdant bamboos, and flowing into the dense cliffs and thickets again. The border treaty at the end of the Guangxu period divided Burma and China by means of this mountain ditch. A Western-style iron bridge stood over the mountain ditch, dazzlingly marking the civilized style of the twentieth century. Beside the mountain ditch, there was a small savage thatched hut, and all the shadows of the primitive era still remained.</p>
<p>Leaning on the railing on the bridge, the smooth mountain road wound to the south, paved with white fine stones, showing the cleanliness after the rain. Gray-green lead pillars stood on the side of the road, and the iron wires of the electric wires stretched across them, extending into the distant trees. When the mountain wind stirred, they made a buzzing sound. Thinking about walking into those mountains in Southern Europe, the scenery in front of the traveler's eyes is probably nothing more than this, right? At the same time, looking back to the north, the mountain road is rugged and accumulated with mud after the rain. No matter who looks at it, it is inevitable to sigh at the difficulty of walking. The electric wires connected to Chinese cities are also not lacking, but the electric poles are made of thick bamboo poles, which look quite shabby. Fortunately, at that time, I didn't have much hope for China, so in contrast, I didn't feel any sentiment at all. Just like a thorough wanderer, I happily stepped into a fresh environment.</p>
<p>That year, when I arrived here, it was noon after a light rain. The sky suddenly cleared, and the surrounding mountains covered in green clothes were as fresh as after a bath. The fragrance of wild grass and tender branches floated everywhere in the air. The stream made a gurgling sound, flowing to the distance, and then dissolved into the quiet embrace of ten thousand mountains. At that time, I ate a meal made by the savages in the small thatched hut beside the bridge. Even now, when I think about it, I still find it quite interesting. At first, when I saw this only small thatched hut, no matter how humble it was, I always felt that in this environment where all I could see were mountains and green trees, it would reduce the traveler's loneliness in many ways. But later, when I lowered my head and went in, I found out what the owner was like, and my heart couldn't help but beat faster, as if I had walked into a black shop selling human meat buns. Because the owner had a long knife with a flat head hanging on his waist (wearing a knife is a custom of the savages, and every adult man must carry it. Even when they are soldiers, they never leave this ancestral long knife in addition to carrying a gun) and his face was naturally untamed. His two lips revealed a look as if he had just eaten human blood, because he often chewed betel nuts. The black cloth turban wrapped around his head had a section left over, standing straight on his hair, vividly depicting the demeanor of a hero of the green forest. Eating under the hospitality of such a host, and in the lonely ten thousand mountains, who can forget it? The dishes I ate that time, in addition to a bamboo tube with a light yellow vegetable soup, were a small bag of tree vegetables wrapped around [omitted] (I didn't dare to use chopsticks [omitted, said to be] to fill my stomach, because there were no chopsticks at all).</p>
<p>After the explanation of my traveling companion, I grabbed it and tasted it, and found it was unusually crisp and fragrant, and very delicious. When eating, there was no table, no凳子, just squatting on the ground like a beggar. After eating such a meal, I climbed to the western-style bridgehead, waved to the north, and said goodbye to China, and no emotion of reluctance welled up in my heart.</p>
<p>After crossing the bridge, not far away, beside the road, stretched another small black road, which led to the nearby military camp. Indian troops lived there, guarding the Burmese border, and at any time had the responsibility of expanding it.</p>

<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>The mother grumbled with complaints; the wife shed tears.</p>
<p>The young husband's heart felt as if it were being twisted by a knife; he hung his head.</p>
<p>"Humph! No words to say! No rice in the jar, no firewood under the stove; you don't care about anything. As soon as you get your salary, you have to buy woolen socks for your wife first, afraid of freezing your precious wife!..." the mother said angrily. Then she sighed softly.</p>
<p>"I think, freezing won't kill anyone, not having food to eat is hard. Don't you think about it yourself: twenty or thirty yuan a month, what's that enough for? Everything is expensive now, you can't even take care of food and clothing, and you still want to spend it recklessly. When you're hungry, you'll only have to drink the northwest wind!..."</p>
<p>The mother saw that her son was drooping his head and looking dejected, so her tone seemed to soften a little.</p>
<p>The young husband's heart was filled with waves of regret, surging. He thought:</p>
<p>"Ah! Mother! How could I not understand the difficult situation at home? I also know that this money should be used to buy urgently needed supplies! But when I saw my [wife's] feet were so badly frozen that she couldn't even wear shoes: in this season of deep winter, she was still wearing single-thread socks, how could I bear it? You think, how can a person's skin withstand the severe cold? Moreover, these woolen socks didn't cost much money!"</p>
<p>However, he didn't dare to argue like this; he just let it simmer in his stomach.</p>
<p>The mother glanced at her son, propped her right hand on her chin; puffed out her cheeks; and snorted from her nostrils.</p>
<p>"...Humph! As the saying goes, "A mother is a roadside grass", a wife is still better." Loves his wife so much!...</p>
<p>He throws his mother behind his back.... the mother muttered to herself.</p>
<p>The young husband glanced sideways at his wife, remaining silent. The wife also just stared at the ground with distress.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>The room was filled with unpleasant air.</p>
<p>The young husband's heart felt as if it were being twisted by a knife, drooping his head.</p>
<p>The mother grumbled with complaints, the wife shed tears.</p>
<h3 id="e245">No Snow <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Miao Chongqun</p>
<p>—Scenery of Northern Country in 1933</p>
<p>Near the desert, when the wind blows, the sky is yellow.</p>
<p>Camels silently carry coal blocks from Mentougou. A good load is several hundred pieces, and two can carry more than a ton. There is no need for any heavy trucks, anyway, when they are transported to the city, they turn into smoke ash and slag.</p>
<p>Camels are in rows and columns. At the back of each row, there is always a small one; with a bell made of a foreign cigarette can hanging on its neck. When you hear the ding-dong sound, you know the camels are about to pass.</p>
<p>In winter, there is no snow, and in spring, you can't see any green grass. You don't step on the desert, you step on dust that is deeper than the ash in the incense burner. Those foreigners who live in the Legation Quarter, they are tired of the imperial palace, tired of Qianmen Street and the antiques on Morrison Street, sometimes they run up our city walls, with their Agfa or Kodak cameras, they aim the lens at rows of camels or scattered, messy, yellow-skinned people on the street and press the button. The so-called scenery in this ancient city is captured by them.</p>
<p>The locals don't understand what the Legation Quarter is, they just know that the place with gun emplacements and artillery forts is "West Jiaomin Lane".</p>
<p>Not only is there green grass in West Jiaomin Lane, but it is greener than anywhere else. The trees are also special, each one is painted with white lime, showing them to be so neat and clean.</p>
<p>Foreign dogs with short chestnut hair, their bodies glistening like satin. This luster is also the dignity of their owners. They have good nutrition, eating several pounds of beef and biscuits every day according to the rules. The owners work in big foreign buildings, and they stroll or wander outside, their lives are very leisurely.</p>
<p>When the weather is good, their eyes squint a little. On the grass or under the roots of trees, they can sniff the scent of the opposite sex, and no one cares about these things, as long as they are happy.</p>
<p>Standing on the post is a Chinese man, wearing yellow, Qing Dynasty-era short-筒靴子, holding a short警棍 in his hand. He is also very idle, looking at the grass, looking at the trees, looking at the foreign dogs, when he is lost in thought, he looks a little dull.</p>
<p>—Tomorrow I'll get my pay, he thought, the lunar calendar is already the fifth month, the festival is coming soon.</p>
<p>He lowered his head for a while, and soon turned it again, as if something had touched his mind.</p>
<p>Gently whistling,</p>
<p>—Sanbao, that little girl, is going to go up against me again.</p>
<p>—Tell her to burn good tobacco泡 on the kang...</p>

<h3 id="e246">Financial Silver Futures Rise Insignificantly, Gold Market Experiences Minor Correction <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>The situation is mostly sideways with a slight rebound to 5.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a slight correction due to the weak increase in silver futures. However, the overall situation remained sideways. In the morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US saw a unified surge, but silver futures only rose by a meager 0.06 to 0.022 taels. Exchange rates saw minimal fluctuations. London spot gold rose by six pence, American cotton rose slightly by three points, and American wheat decreased slightly by half a point. The opening price of the wool market was stable and then rose to 41.12 yuan. After opening, banks initially hoarded and then released, with HSBC listing British currency at par and American currency down 0.0125. As a result, gold prices briefly turned from weak to firm. However, banks took advantage of the high prices to release their holdings, Jewish merchants and Qiaozhi just released US dollars, Sassoon aggressively sold shillings, and the Central Bank also dumped US dollars, leading to a loosening of the domestic market and a sudden decline in confidence, with prices dropping to over 11 yuan. The afternoon market opened flat, with wavering confidence and minor corrections from time to time. However, due to strong buying interest from banks and the Central Bank's intermittent intervention, gold prices managed to rebound. Trading in March futures was lackluster, briefly breaking into 700 yuan territory, but ultimately remained stable. The day lacked major news, causing some confusion. The Central Bank opened spot trading in the morning, with 70 bars of Taikang Run and 35 bars of Dadecheng priced at 941.5 yuan, equivalent to a pure gold price of 953.5 yuan. The day's market conditions are summarized below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 940.7 yuan, up 3.2 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 0.08 yuan. The exchange rate opened in the morning with recent selling prices of 1 shilling 4.5625 pence for British currency and 35 yuan for US currency. At the market opening, Pan Gen and Citibank's selling of June US dollars at 4.375 yuan caused a slight dip. Banks needed to settle at this price, and Dachangxiang Sheng, Dazhifeng Yong, and others entered the market sequentially, anticipating that HSBC would list British currency at par and American currency down 0.0125, leading to a rise to 3.5 yuan. Mitsui sold June US dollars at 3.75 yuan. Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, Yongheng, Yu Yongde, Tianfeng, Dafa Yong, and others collectively sold off. Qiaozhi just sold May US dollars at 2.5 yuan, but it was still difficult to sell. Sassoon supplied shillings, causing a drop. After entering the market, the Central Bank vigorously sold US dollars, with May US dollars even selling for 3.75 yuan. Sanchang, Hengxingyuan, Yuan Mao Yong, and others continued to sell, causing a drop to below 39 yuan. The Central Bank opened spot sales, and Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, and others bought bars. Yi Dayong even bought up to 0.3 yuan. Hengxingyuan, Yuansheng, Yonghengchang Yong, Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, and others continued to supply bars. Shanghai sold June US dollars at half a yuan, and Mai Jia Li sold at 5.5625 yuan, causing a drop to 37.3 yuan. Yi Dayong and Hengxing seized the opportunity to buy in at low prices. Mitsui and Citibank bought June US dollars at 5.625 yuan, leading to a rebound. Yuan Mao Yong bought again up to 0.04 yuan. After wavering, the noon close was 939.5 yuan, with goods quoted at 40 yuan. After the close, it rose to over 41 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 941.3 yuan, with goods opening at 1.2 yuan. Hengyu and Yuanchun bought up to over 2 yuan. Zhengchang, Yi Dayong, Zhifengyong, Shunmao, and others all sold, causing another drop to 0.02 yuan. Shanghai bought June US dollars at half a yuan, leading to stabilization. After entering the market, Zhifengyong worked hard to buy, and Hengyu and Fuyu also bought, causing a rise to 2.4 yuan. Bingxing sold bars, leading to a slight decrease of 1 yuan. Shanghai bought June US dollars at 4.375 yuan, and the Central Bank bought the same month at 3.375 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Kangxiang, Zhifengyong, Hengxingyuan, Yi Dayong, and others collectively bought bars, causing a further rise to 4 yuan. Zhifengyong took the opportunity to sell high, and Tianfeng also sold some, causing a retreat to within 3 yuan. However, due to banks buying June US dollars at 4.375 yuan, Dachangxiang, Yongfeng, and Hengtai continued to buy at low prices, making the situation quite stable. The closing price was 943.3 yuan, with goods quoted at 3.6 yuan. The highest price for the day was 944 yuan, and the lowest price was 937.2 yuan, a difference of 6.8 yuan. As a result, it closed up 5.8 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>The settlement price, with HSBC listing the US dollar down 0.0125 at 34.25 yuan, results in a benchmark gold price of over 1010 yuan. Based on the closing price, it is approximately 67 yuan above the benchmark, down 2 yuan from the previous close. The settlement price for March futures, with the shilling unchanged, is still calculated at 711 "Di Xiong" (a term for interest). Based on the closing price, it is approximately 9 yuan above the benchmark. The registered price for this month is 699 yuan, and for April, it is 940 yuan. The morning supplement is 699 yuan, and the afternoon supplement is 702 yuan. Pure gold is calculated at 953.5 yuan. In formal trading within the market, the Tianjin group provided a significant amount, with prices starting at 13 yuan above the benchmark, reaching 13.5 yuan. Ultimately, it was still calculated at 13 yuan above the benchmark, with Yingfeng Heng and the Qianzhuang group Lichang and others each buying over 1,000 units. March chips totaled 10,895 units.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was still active. In summary, Yuanchun, Dachangxiang, Hengchangyong, Hengxingsheng, Dazhifeng Yongfu, Taiheng, Hengtai, Yuan Mao Yong, and others were on the buying side. Yi Fengyong, Hengyu, Zhaofeng Chang, Xie Xingyong, Hui Xiangyong, Deyicheng, Dacheng, Daxing Yong, Wan Xing, and others were on the selling side. Yuanheng, Dafa Yong, and Sida initially bought and then sold. Hengxingyuan, Dadecheng, and Yi Dayong initially sold and then bought. The Dalian group Wan Xing traded a total of over 600 units, netting out slightly less than 200 units. Shunli traded a total of over 200 units, netting out 42 units. The Guangdong group Shengda bought over 200 units and sold around 100 units. Hengxing bought a small amount. As of today, April chips totaled 15,596 units, with a total of 33 long positions and 59 short positions. The total trading volume was 32,683 units in the morning and 16,590 units in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The three-day futures opened in the morning at 702 yuan, up 0.5 yuan from the previous close. Huabi and others bought and settled April shillings at 5.625.

<p>The previous market declined due to deteriorating Russo-Japanese news.</p>
<p>The afternoon market saw improved confidence and a unified turn towards recovery.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market atmosphere was affected by the news of deteriorating Russo-Japanese relations, and many bulls feared pressure from bears, so they emerged from the market. However, large investors' buying interest remained strong, so although the market price fell, it soon recovered. Although the Russo-Japanese situation had the appearance of escalating tensions, the matter was of great importance, so it was unlikely that hostilities would break out in the short term. In fact, market prices were already high, and slight market rumors easily caused fluctuations, which was expected. However, based on observations of market sentiment and environmental conditions, there was unlikely to be a sharp decline in the near future. The salt tax market price fell to 52.25 yuan yesterday, and then recovered to 52.75 yuan, approaching the 3 yuan mark, oscillating back and forth, having already done so three times without breaking through. If there are no changes within the day, there may be a possibility of breaking through, otherwise there should be a correction of 1-2 yuan. At the opening of the market yesterday morning, large investors sold the most of the 5th and 13th issues, and other retail investors were also very active, believing that the Russo-Japanese situation was deteriorating, and bulls emerged from the market in droves. The market price suddenly decreased by 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.5-0.6 yuan. In the second round of trading, there were few sellers, and although the market price still felt weak and sluggish, it became stable and recovered 0.1-0.2 yuan. At the opening of the market in the afternoon, confidence improved, and the 16th, 47th, and 50th issues were all bought, and the market price unanimously recovered by 0.2-0.3 yuan to 0.4-0.5 yuan. At the close, there was a continued slight recovery of 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.3 yuan. However, with regard to the unified salt tax, the 11th and 37th issues were sold relatively more, and a slight decline of 0.1-0.2 yuan was seen. As a result, the market price, in addition to a slight recovery of 0.1 yuan and 0.15 yuan for the current month's 20-volume issue and long-term clean-up bonds, showed a unified decline of 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.5-0.6 yuan. The total transaction volume was 13,589,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot trading and 13,585,000 yuan in futures trading. The comparison table of highs, lows, rises, and falls is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm on the 28th stated that the New York stock market initially rose because of good industrial and commercial reports and because it was thought that the Frack Q proposal would not be as severe as originally planned. Therefore, the market situation had improved by several points to 3 yuan by noon. After that, speculators turned to the selling side, and the price recovered slightly. However, the pressure was not widespread. At the same time, the shares in the small exchange did not fall due to the bulls settling. As for bonds, speculative bonds rose, and high-quality bonds and US government bonds were slightly mixed. Looking at the current situation, it is unlikely that there will be significant changes. The full-day trading volume was 1.32 million shares. According to a report from the Copper and Iron Century, the steel workload is currently 47%, the highest since August, due to large-scale demand from the automobile industry and the railway industry has begun to place orders. Wheat trading was light, the market was flat and tired, the news was irrelevant, and political news wanted to raise prices, but buyers were unmoved. Cotton sentiment was unstable. The Punkhage proposal will probably be sent to the House of Representatives tomorrow. The cloth market is quiet. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending weak, and the fall is intensifying. With the overseas cotton market flat and current yarn sales sluggish, and Japanese merchants reporting that inventories are still high, sentiment is weak, and selling is on the rise again. The recent decline has been significant, falling by 8 yuan from the high price. However, the large purchase amount by a certain large merchant has not moved. In short, real demand is too sluggish, and the pressure on the yarn market is difficult to reduce.</p>

<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market this morning, the August issue was listed, and there were not many buyers in the market. Current yarn business was also light, with each month falling by 0.5, 0.8, and 0.7 yuan. In the afternoon, the bulls settled their positions, and the market situation became more and more weak, with each month falling sharply by 1.4, 0.9 yuan to 2.3 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 30,800 bales. It was found that Chunji sold 2,800 bales, Dafeng sold 3,000 bales, and Ruida sold 2,200 bales. Delong bought 1,150 bales, Mingde bought 950 bales, Yuanda bought 2,650 bales, and Dachangcheng bought 950 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Sales of current yarn are still sluggish. It was found that the total statistics of purchases from various groups for the day were only 261 bales. Market prices fell by 0.5-1 yuan. The purchase amounts of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou 50, Mainland 80, North Help 10, Ningbo 1</p>
<p>Yunnan 40, Guangdong 35, Changsha 25, Peer 20</p>
<p>The cotton market is very tired, and the trend of falling prices has risen again. Because the yarn market is not prosperous, the consumption of current cotton is light. At the same time, American cotton is calm and Indian cotton is trending down, causing people's hearts to weaken. According to some news, Japanese merchants have absorbed a lot in the standard market, but it is still difficult to reverse the decline.</p>

As a result, spot prices did not move, and futures rose by 2 to 9 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 4 points, and futures rose by 11 to 14 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 11 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to bull settlement and selling by European exporters.

<p>It is said that the government wheat factory has completed two ship deals.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month initially showed a steady trend of declining. Because the quoted prices of foreign wheat, in both Chicago and Canada, continued to fall by around 0.2 yuan, sentiment was flat at the beginning. After that, due to rumors that the government wheat factory had already completed deals, one saying two ships, another saying one and a half ships, it was heard that Fufeng had ordered one ship and Wuxi Jiufeng had ordered half a ship, with prices all at 4 yuan plus 0.03 yuan. As a result, Fuxin, Fufeng, and other factories vigorously dumped, and prices gradually fell sharply. As for each factory's spot goods, Fuxin initially shouted 2 yuan plus 0.08 yuan, and then followed Fufeng's direct deduction according to the standard. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, the market situation for each month showed a slightly steady trend. Because Tianjin was vigorously buying this month, it was heard that there were more than 100,000 bags traded throughout the day. For the long-term, with foreign wheat being so cheap, the bulls had no intention of betting anymore, and prices continued to fall. For example, the June issue had reached 2 yuan plus 0.0375 yuan, and the predicted 2 yuan mark was approaching. As a result, the current month fell by 0.02 yuan, April fell by 0.0275 yuan, May fell by 0.025 yuan, June fell by 0.03 yuan, July fell by 0.035 yuan, August opened at 0.</p>

<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market saw a generally flat and weak trend in various months' trading during both the morning and afternoon sessions. The quotations for foreign wheat, both Chicago and Canadian, were down by about two cents. However, the market sentiment was relatively stable due to the fact that the near-term months still involved old stock and that factories still had an appetite for it. Although the environment was not favorable and foreign wheat prices were gradually decreasing, concerns about the recent chilly spring weather kept sellers at bay, leading to price stability. Ultimately, only the July contract saw a slight drop of two cents, with no other significant changes. August trading has commenced, with an initial price of $2.92, which remained unchanged. The current wheat market shows a trend towards stability. Shandong wheat opened at $3.45, Yaowan wheat at $3.45, and Bengbu wheat at $3.35, with an estimated volume of 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Suzhou Tongjing Rice Rises Again by Five Cents <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources of various rice types are similar to before, totaling over 20 firms (more than 3,000 shi). Local stores have a slight stock, and the market situation has improved. Due to limited arrivals of Suzhou Tongjing rice, the price continued to rise by five cents. The market for Changbang, Nangang, and other types of Japonica rice, as well as Duyangjians, remained largely unchanged. The market for green-husked, Sijing, and Xilian late rice varieties was quiet and weak, as the Rongbang's stock interest suddenly waned. Trading of Northern and Southern Ocean rice amounted to around 1,000 bags, with prices trending down by two to three cents. The supply of Yinbian Yuan rice was slightly stronger, but the market remained soft with no significant price changes.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Supplies from various regions numbered over 30 firms. Sales of various rice types in the market turned sluggish, with slight movements in stock interest. The price of white japonica rice slightly adjusted by a few cents, while white Yuan rice remained scarce and firm. Yangjian, Dujian, early thin rice, and Bujians and Kejians from the ports remained stable.</p>

<p>The volume of Guest-Grade Indica Rice Declines Due to Shallow River Levels</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for guest-grade indica rice saw slow trading for both local and guest merchants, with particularly stagnant stock interest among guest merchants. In the whole market, only Fuzhou merchants purchased 215 bags of late Jiangxi machine-milled rice at $7.45, with no other inquiries. However, yesterday, Taizhou merchants arrived in the city to try out 100 bags of Hunan machine-milled red rice. This was the first transaction of its kind, as Taizhou's rice production was insufficient for its own needs last year. Currently, inventory in the Taizhou area is low, and prices are rising, hence the trial in Shanghai. If smooth trade is possible, there may be continued inquiries. Local merchants continued to outperform guest merchants, purchasing 120 bags of Jiangxi Yin Yuan rice at $6.50, 250 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice, 100 bags of machine-milled red rice, 309 bags of Pingjing rice, and 50 bags of Wuxi machine-milled Yuan rice. Prices were similar to the previous day's quotations. Sales of guest-grade indica rice were sluggish yesterday, and the market price should have declined slightly. However, due to recent shallow river levels hindering transportation, supplies have decreased, thus somewhat supporting the market.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Sugar Market: Chaozhou Green Sugar Sales Still Active <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a smaller customs gold rate, weakening market sentiment. The guild's clearing prices for #24 coarse granulated white sugar decreased by five cents to $19.70, but transactions remained limited. The asking prices for #9, Hechi, and Taikoo Sugar's "B" mark remained the same as before, but with little trading. The factory's #1 cotton white sugar was at $18.75, with a price reduction of two cents per load for #2, #3, and #4. Sales were sporadic. Dalong Company offered 100 bags of Zhuqing sugar at $10.08. Sales of Chaozhou green sugar have been active in recent days, with an additional 200+ bags offered yesterday at prices ranging from $11.00 to $10.065 and $10.05. Current Shanghai inventories are not abundant, and with brisk out-of-town sales, the market is expected to tighten further.</p>

<h3 id="e284">Suicide <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>On the desk sits a set of calendars from the 23rd year of the Republic of China; although only a little over fifty pages have been turned – not even two months have passed – nevertheless, the number of suicide cases that have occurred has already exceeded twenty, and most of them involve young men and women. Examining the reasons for their suicides, they are nothing more than economic hardship, romantic issues, and failure in education. In particular, the recent cases of Hu Zhen, Yan Xiu'e, Wu Jilan, Ai Xia, and an unidentified glamorous corpse caused a sensation for a time. They suddenly seemed to have thrown a huge rock into this normally calm Shanghai society, stirring up ripples!</p>
<p>Ai Xia was a movie star and a talented writer. Wu Jilan was a famous female performer of Peking Opera, with considerable literary cultivation. However, their suicides! Sudden suicides! Until now, no one understands the real reasons? Was it economic hardship? Was it romance? No – it was neither. So what was it? It has finally become a huge question?</p>
<p>Similarly, both Ai Xia and Wu Jilan committed suicide! But Ai Xia attracted a lot of attention, or perhaps it could be said, sympathy. Because she was a fellow writer, she was an artist, so five or six Shanghai newspapers published special memorial issues for her, and several news reporters were troubled to personally visit her, and several newspapers used grand special headlines to report her suicide. It is said that the general literary and art circles are still preparing a memorial service for her! I think Ai Xia's death is worthwhile and glorious. She herself, even in the afterlife, would exclaim, "This death was not in vain!" Her deeds, her extraordinary deeds, may soon be compiled into books and filmed on the silver screen by great writers! After all, she is worthy of being called a "modern woman," a "daughter of the era"!</p>
<p>The death of the nameless glamorous corpse was by throwing herself on the Songhu Road train tracks, but what exactly happened is still unclear. Hu Zhen's death was because she was not admitted to the school she applied to. Regarding Ms. Hu's suicide, I do not want to say anything, but I think that women's minds are too narrow. For the sake of not being admitted to school, is it worth committing suicide! Although her spirit of eagerness to learn is commendable, she should not have taken such a passive path. Therefore, I dare not commend her determination to die!</p>
<p>Speaking of Yan Xiu'e, she was romantic in the past, and regretful later. Her final encounter was meeting an unvirtuous man, leading to abandonment. She had also received considerable education, but she went astray. Now, although she is aware of her mistakes, "one wrong step leads to eternal regret, a hundred years before you can turn back"! Originally, the temptations of money, material possessions, and sensual pleasures in this era make it easy for young women with weak wills to fall. Yan Xiu'e can serve as an excellent warning to modern young women!</p>
<p>I am not saying something cruel, but their deaths are not a pity. Who told them not to be good people, but instead to seek trouble? If they had used such a courageous spirit of going to their deaths to fight for their own careers! To struggle for the future of their lives! Then, I think, the final victory would belong to them. Now, they suffer the consequences of their own actions, and they cannot blame the environment, let alone society. What else is there to say?</p>
<p>Love—is something that is seen as nothing, smells like nothing; what is there to cherish about it? But it devours countless ambitious and promising young people, burying many in the grave of love.</p>
<p>Economics—Although it can control everything for people, I believe that as long as we have the same courage and perseverance as those who commit suicide to fight against it, there will come a time when it will be controlled by us.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether their deaths are considered great or insignificant by people, I cannot sympathize with them. I only feel sorry for them, that they died so undeservedly and so unconsciously. I am not against death, but I advocate that even death must be valuable, to be worthy of parents and society. Otherwise, it is always a misfortune for the country and a loss to society!</p>
<p>The tide of suicide is surging again. Taking poison in pairs, taking poison alone, the suicide cases in the future may be just beginning to flourish!</p>
<p>As the curtain of the 23rd year of the Republic of China has just begun to rise, shocking suicide cases have been occurring one after another in the social strata of Shanghai. In this way, I think that rather than saying that this year is the "Women's National Goods Year," it would be more accurate and more fitting to call it the "XX Suicide Year"!</p>
<h3 id="e285">Impressions After Watching the Second Public Performance of the Nameless Theater Actors Association <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Compared to Chinese cinema, there is no denying that the atmosphere of stage plays is indeed frighteningly cold. Therefore, when people are eagerly hoping to obtain sufficient spiritual nourishment from the stage, even a small-scale public performance makes them feel very excited. This time, the Nameless Theater Actors Association held its second public performance at the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Hall, and on the evening of February 26th, I also went to see it with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>It is said that the first public performance of the theater group was at the Jiuyai Grand Theater. At that time, because I didn't know about it, I didn't go to see it, so I naturally don't know how well it went. However, this time, although it did not give me a very good impression in terms of technique, in terms of meaning, it cannot help but make us marvel.</p>
<p>We can say with certainty that the members of the Nameless Theater Group, from the selection of scripts to the spirit they express, all prove that they are all strong people who are closely following the giant waves of the times and striving forward. They have a deep understanding of the current society. They deeply understand that all the old and rotten things will inevitably be destroyed, and they are eagerly looking forward to the arrival of light in their struggles and pain. Therefore, I express my sincere respect to the members of the Nameless Theater Actors Association here.</p>
<p>In addition, I should offer some personal opinions on this public performance in the most well-intentioned manner. Of course, this is not criticism. However, I only watched the evening performance, and what I write is limited to the four plays: "The Vagrant," "Brothers," "One Hundred Pounds," and "Three Families Living Together." At the same time, I do not want to describe each play in detail separately, but it is more convenient to speak generally.</p>
<p>At a time when unemployment is increasing and there is no guarantee or relief for them, "The Vagrant," which writes about social unrest and the anxiety of the unemployed from the reverse side, is naturally in line with reality. Similarly, at a time when the call for rent reduction has become widespread throughout Shanghai, the performance of "Three Families Living Together" is naturally more meaningful. In addition, "Brothers" writes about the different experiences of brothers from different environments, further unfolding the contradictory relationship of the new ethics. As for "One Hundred Pounds," perhaps we find it unfamiliar that the police officer is not concerned with the reward of one hundred pounds and releases the escaped prisoner, but the fact that revolutionary fighters have won widespread sympathy is the most obvious and common phenomenon.</p>
<p>In these four one-act plays, each naturally has its own individual theme, but we can easily find a common point, which is that they are very in line with reality. Social unrest, the unfortunate bloodshed and active turmoil of the oppressed, and the inevitable victorious future. What is even more obvious is that all four plays have police officers whose task is to prevent "those above from falling down and those below from turning upside down," but what they show in their actions is very ridiculous.</p>
<p>It is clear that these plays are not only very needed at the moment, but are also being eagerly accepted by the general audience who are struggling day and night in distress, because each play is made up of excerpts. However, the form cannot keep up with the content, which is not only the biggest regret of Chinese films, but is even more obvious in stage performance.</p>
<p>This is naturally undeniable, and the performance techniques undoubtedly cannot satisfy the audience's requirements. If we want to promote the progress of acting techniques, we may as well strictly put forward some necessary opinions. In "The Vagrant," the composition of the stage surface shows considerable directorial achievement. This is naturally the beautification of the set (although it cannot be more realistic). The soft lighting gives people a considerable degree of aesthetic feeling. And the grasp of the characters' positions and moods has been appropriately successful. This is not only because the vagrant has a wide space to act, but especially because the lawyer Li Peier and the tea house waiter always stand on the steps and do not come down, which is not annoying. Although the climax of the play only relies on effects, the cry of "We want bread" is ultimately tense enough to make people tremble.</p>
<p>Similarly, the director of "One Hundred Pounds" also saw success. Especially the silence of the deep night, from beginning to end, did not relax, which is definitely not easy to do. However, it is a pity that the appropriate lighting was not used to turn the gray cloth into the black night sky or the water surface. Especially the corner lamp on the left, like "Brothers," is completely unreasonable. If it is said that it is to help the lack of footlights, then I think it is unnecessary to consider. If there is a desolate street lamp next to the cargo box, wouldn't it be possible to illuminate the face and add a lot of mood? What's more, Spotlight gives us free use. Even if you can't see the facial expressions, it's not such a big loss in this play. Let's think about it, the beautiful moon, the desolate street lamp, the quiet piano sound, if you add the crisp sound of oars, and the wriggling figures almost turn into shadows, what kind of mood is that? However, our director is not good enough to grasp it.</p>
<p>Next, we should talk about "Brothers." This is a very serious tragedy. If the director can boldly emphasize the prison with dark lighting, except for the candles, there is only the faint light that penetrates from the window or the iron gate, plus the sound of iron chains, the sound of the lock when the prison door is opened and closed, and the terrible footsteps of the guards walking outside the window, wouldn't it be a poetic scene. However, an inexplicable white light shoots up from the ground. In that not-wide prison, there are such beautiful chairs and tables, regardless of whether this is a foreign custom or not, it ultimately cannot make people feel realistic. In addition, in the handling of the characters, the younger brother is always standing irrelevantly, and the older brother does not have enough opportunity to express his grief and excitement. Of course, it is because the actors' abilities are not enough, but the fact that the director did not use the actors actively cannot be denied. However, the light change in the back is still acceptable.</p>
<p>Finally, the worst is "Three Families Living Together." Perhaps this is because there are more people involved, making it difficult to handle, and at the same time, it is a Chinese play, making it easier for us to see the flaws in the play from our own life experiences and feelings. But the scene is completely dull, without any rhythm of the play. For example, that worker has nothing to do from beginning to end, and the others are arranged unnaturally. In particular, the atmosphere of civilized drama is too strong, which is the biggest failure. This is naturally the greatest responsibility that the director should bear.</p>
<p>Now we should briefly talk about some aspects of the performance. The protagonists of several plays have achieved considerable success. Jin Shanjun's role as Laure in "The Vagrant" is certainly not good enough to express the dual personality of the character in the play, but it is not a failure. Tao Haijun, who plays the lawyer in the same play, is dressed too badly. In order to exaggerate the drama, wearing a big belly must have an appropriate physique, but with his thin physique, it is a complete failure. Boss Nicholas and the mailman are quite commendable. The police officer is the worst. Ji Xujun, who plays the younger brother in "Brothers," is too unfamiliar and has no experience. Sha Baijun, who plays Annie, is okay, but still lacks composure. The makeup of the actor who plays the pastor is excellent, but unfortunately his lines are unclear. Wei Heling and Wang Ying from "One Hundred Pounds" are naturally the most skilled among all the actors. To be strict, Wang Yingjun's voice is not loud enough, and Wei Helingjun did not show the inner contradictions, and the two police officers are too weak. The roles in "Three Families Living Together" are all mediocre. Although Sha Baijun's makeup as an old woman is not very good, it is still passable. Ms. Chen Qiufang and Ms. Hu Li are both daring to act, but they are not skilled. Ji Xujun's Ah Ming and Kang Lijun's drunk are mediocre, Xu Digongjun is okay, but his lines are not familiar enough. Yao Pingjun is not enough to make people hate Diao Zhongren. Ye Mingjun is extremely unfamiliar. As for Jing Junjun</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Jing Junjun's Ah Yun was okay when she first came on stage, but later she became a completely civilized drama, and she should be the most failed one in the play.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we can find a common weakness. In addition to insufficient equipment due to economic reasons, the lack of rehearsal and the hasty performance are the main reasons for the failure. As for not having a good rehearsal, the lighting or sound effects will naturally not be satisfactory. Therefore, in amateur theater groups that do not have sufficient funding, is it not a good result?</p>
<p>But in order to improve the technical level of drama, in order to increase the audience's interest in stage plays, in order to complete a new form to meet the requirements of the content, how will we work hard to improve our work? We demand our own theater, we demand actors who are constantly training, and we demand technical experts who take theater as a lifelong career. Therefore, we should make our best efforts to organize professional theater troupes, which is our main task at present.</p>
<h3 id="e286">The Problem of Youth Love <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Yuan</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, New Romanticism has invaded this feudal China along with capitalism. As a result, young people have risen up to resist the old families, and the feudal forces have gradually been shaken by the flood of capitalism. At this time, young people are desperately struggling outward, wanting to get rid of the shackles of feudal families. They are dissatisfied with all the old morals, old etiquette, old ideas, and old literature, and are eager to seek new ideas and new literature. As a result, the literature of New Romanticism has risen! Of course, it suits the tastes of young people. The so-called "love," which China has never had before, has gradually emerged! Now it is even more common!</p>
<p>In today's China, which is suffering from natural disasters and man-made disasters, and internal and external troubles, anyone who understands a little feels that there is no way out for the country and individuals, and that society is dark. Warm-hearted young people naturally feel the same way! Young people with wavering wills, when they feel this way, and do not have the courage to fight in this harsh environment and find a way out, feel the oppression of evil forces, and do not have the courage to resist them, they only feel sad and troubled, so they become negative! When they can enjoy themselves, they should enjoy themselves! Live one day at a time, seek some pleasure in love! They waste their energy and time completely on love. Hypocritical love requires money to maintain. The rewards from a legitimate profession are certainly not enough to spend, so they surrender to evil forces and become lackeys!</p>
<p>The youth who advocate love above all else, of course, needless to say, take love as the whole of life, seeking only their own enjoyment, not knowing the past or the future. Although they sing "sacred love is unconditional"! But they will never fall in love with poor boys, they must use money as the standard. To make their love very happy, they must have money, so they also surrender to evil forces and become lackeys! Love has become the only way for young people to fall!</p>
<p>From the above, it seems that love is the root of youth's fall. No! Love is not a bad thing. Everyone has feelings, and it is okay to be in love at the appropriate time, but we cannot take love as the whole of life. Love is a part of human life, but the important thing is not here. The important thing is to temper ourselves, to strengthen our will. When we feel the oppression of evil forces, we should resist. When we feel that there is no way to deal with these evil forces, it is because we have not tempered ourselves well enough. So we must work hard to temper ourselves, and make ourselves sound! Then we will not just feel sad and troubled by the real problems and be unable to solve them! Nor will we become negative and fall because of trouble!</p>

<p>— Ke Xin</p>
<p>Poor woman (stands up from the wall)... I can't bear... to watch you... in my arms... this living... starve... to death... She hangs her head, choked with sobs, and struggles toward the "infant receiving station." When she gets there, she can't support herself. She is leaning on the wall near that drawer with one hand. After resting for a while, she straightens up and looks at that monster-like drawer, reaching out her trembling hand to pull the drawer open. As soon as she touches it, she shrinks back as if she had been electrocuted, tightly holding the baby, afraid that her treasure will be sucked away or harmed. She turns her back and leans against the wall.</p>
<p>At this time, the cold gradually rises, and the snowflakes fall more densely. She shields her baby from the wind and snow, but the wind always attacks her, and the snow always accumulates on her. She is shivering from the cold and can't resist it. Poor woman (takes off her headscarf and covers the baby's head), I can't... let you... freeze to death... in my... arms...</p>
<p>Shivering, she turns around again, timidly approaching the drawer. Just as she is about to reach out to open it...</p>
<p>Baby, guā, guā, guā...</p>
<p>The poor woman quickly retracts her hand and leans against the wall, her head buried in her hands, her back to the audience. She is sobbing, and her shoulders are moving with the baby's cries.</p>
<p>The baby's cries gradually weaken and finally stop. At this time, the wind is stronger and the snow is denser. The poor woman does not turn around, but nervously and tremblingly reaches out to grope for the drawer. She gropes for the drawer handle and grabs it tightly, letting her hand tremble violently there for a while. The drawer slowly opens. She still holds the handle tightly and tremblingly, gradually turning around, looking at the drawer. As she looks at it, the drawer seems to have become a terrible monster's bloody mouth, and she quickly closes it. Tightly holding her child.</p>
<p>Poor woman: I can't, I can't...</p>
<p>She leaves the drawer and wants to go back, but her heavy feet are heavier than when she came, and it is more and more difficult to drag them. Finally, she stops.</p>
<p>Poor woman: Go back... go back... what will I use to raise... my baby? You want to live, you can't; if we have the chance in the future, we will still... baby, I'm not abandoning you... You can't blame me, baby... baby...</p>
<p>As she speaks, she walks toward the drawer. While reaching out to open the drawer, she kisses the baby passionately, sobbing and shouting, until she puts the baby in the drawer and does not stop.</p>
<p>Poor woman (face leaving the baby): Baby, baby...</p>
<p>Sobbing, shouting, slowly pushing the drawer. Finally, she closes it suddenly. She sobs even more fiercely as she is lying there.</p>
<p>Poor woman (inside, suddenly): Guā, guā...</p>
<p>The baby's cries gradually recede.</p>
<p>Poor woman (hurriedly wakes up, pulls open the drawer, sees that it is empty, and anxiously) Baby; baby...</p>
<p>The baby's cries gradually weaken, but the poor woman's voice gradually becomes louder and more urgent.</p>
<p>The wind is blowing fast, and the snow is falling fast. The violin tune now hurts people's hearts as if it is gouging them out.</p>
<p>Poor woman: Baby, baby...</p>
<p>She finally can't support herself, collapsing under the drawer in a heap of grief.</p>
<p>The cold wind sweeps her disheveled hair, and the dense snow rushes to gather on her. The violin seems to be mourning for her with sympathy.</p>

<h3 id="e288">"Storm Over Mexico" <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xingzhi</p>
<p>(1) The Making Process and Disputes</p>
<p>Back in 1930, when Sergei Eisenstein was trying to make his first sound film in Paris, he happened to meet Duca from Paramount Pictures. Duca admired Eisenstein's reputation and immediately asked him to come to Hollywood to make a film. After Eisenstein returned to his country, he brought up the matter for discussion. Having obtained the agreement of his compatriots, Eisenstein, with the mission of absolutely not compromising on "content" and "theme," came to Hollywood to join Paramount Pictures. Initially, the two or three scripts proposed by Eisenstein did not suit the taste of Paramount's producers in any way. Later, with "An American Tragedy," he obtained Duca's consent and started filming. Unfortunately, it was stopped again by an order from the authorities saying "Absolutely no filming allowed."</p>
<p>However, with the help of his friend Upton Sinclair, Eisenstein started a new project, which was the famous "Storm Over Mexico" (Thunder Over Mexico), which stirred up waves in the global film industry. This new project was directed by Eisenstein, scripted by F.G. Alexandrov, and photographed by Eduard Tisse. From 1931 to 1932, it took eleven months, used 200,000 feet of film, and was divided into five parts, with the past, present, and future of Mexico as the themes, creating a narrative poem of Mexican history. However, on the one hand, Sinclair ran out of money and withdrew midway, and on the other hand, Eisenstein had to return to his country for personal reasons, leaving all the film footage in the bustling Hollywood. However, Sinclair, a speculator, for the sake of commercial gain, cut and spliced 7,000 feet of film from the 200,000 feet of film, selected less than one-fifth of the original work's material, and skillfully used Eisenstein's name to publicly sell it in the 1933 film market.</p>
<p>Therefore, the disputes and repercussions caused in the film city of America also stirred up a great storm, coinciding with the title. First, understanding film practitioners and critics began to protest, such as Rover, a strong supporter of Eisenstein in Mexico. Following this movement, the members of the American "Experimental Cinema" magazine organized the "Eisenstein Mexico Film Association," believing that "Storm Over Mexico" was a vulgar and evil film that damaged Eisenstein's reputation, and launched a movement to ban its public screening. Then, the June and September issues of "Closeup" magazine published a declaration, supporting the film that Eisenstein shot in Mexico. They stated that if it was not a work edited by Eisenstein himself, it should not be called a finished film, and proposed a movement to return all the film footage to Eisenstein. Later, famous film critics such as Pound and Braver-Mann were also drawn into the vortex of this event. In particular, on July 5th of last year, Sinclair even issued a statement regarding "Storm Over Mexico," saying, "This was edited according to Eisenstein's intentions." Afterwards, many opinions and groups were discovered, and Eisenstein experts appeared. According to recent rumors, Sinclair was on the verge of bankruptcy because of this film, and Eisenstein was about to file a lawsuit against Sinclair to protect his reputation. Therefore, the waves in the film industry caused by this film became even more chaotic and expanded further.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e289">Review of "His Double Life" Litt—Da Guangming <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>In this hypocritical society of idol worship, artists, with their keen senses, feel most deeply about their own works being misunderstood or even given incorrect evaluations. Artists consider this to be the greatest pain. In their eyes, the general ignorant appreciators do not necessarily understand the true value of art. However, when a small number of artists become famous, their works will be considered priceless treasures. At this time, cunning merchants profit from it, making rash criticisms with their superficial understanding, and art becomes a commodity, and the artist suffers from then on.</p>
<p>We have read countless similar works of art in novels or dramas. The recently released "Heart's Desire" also ridiculed and scolded this situation. And this "His Double Life," adapted from a novel, is an even more delightful scolding.</p>
<p>I don't think this needs further explanation. The death of a famous painter's servant can be mistaken for the painter's death, shocking the whole country, while the painter himself is ridiculed and even driven away by the police as a madman. Similarly, art merchants boldly use the painter's name to make a lot of money. Strange things happen one after another, and jokes pile up. Thus, the pure and straightforward painter, in his sadness, concludes that ignorant and cunning people all wear shameful masks, and he himself is unreasonably being toyed with.</p>
<p>We cannot help but be moved by the subject matter described above. However, the performance techniques appear very mediocre. If we were to be more demanding, then it is simply, apart from some humorous dialogue, nothing to commend.</p>
<p>Of course, we are saying that with American film technology, it should have been more successful. But the director, in addition to narrating this bizarre and tortuous story, did not emphasize the story more dramatically. We only see Laurel and Hardy doing quite a bit of acting, while Liliane Haidee, who plays the female lead, simply has nothing to do. The whole film is dull, obscure, like the plum rain season, making people feel weak and bored to death. Perhaps we will not overlook the simple techniques in it, such as Alice and Fred starting to live together, ending with just saying "I do" to each other, but when Alice meets Rick's wife, it is a long conversation around the table. Fortunately, the obscure atmosphere is considerably harmonized by funny words. When Rick and his mother left, the scene of Fred walking into the house from the heavy night fog was very beautiful. Later, the scene of washing feet, that sketch of a harmonious family, is also very commendable. Furthermore, the masks on everyone's faces in Fred's eyes should be the deepest intention of this film. However, some parts of the court are operatic, which is very inconsistent with the realistic style of the whole film.</p>
<p>What else is there to say? Liliane Haidee gave the Chinese audience the most painful impression. Therefore, her dubbed version of Griffith's famous work "Marriage License?" was once released, and her name is quite appealing in China. However, the glory of the past has ultimately faded with her youth. Here, although she is dressed as a young girl, she cannot hide the inherent twilight in her movements and expressions. However, why did she, who is known for playing tragedies, play this non-crying and non-smiling role when she re-emerged on the screen? She is indeed a typical role of a virtuous wife and loving mother, but unfortunately, she has not fully played it here. I think this should be the director's fault. On the contrary, Laurel and Hardy, who are usually known for playing quirky roles, have achieved considerable success in playing a loyal and docile painter here.</p>

<p>— Du Ming</p>
<p>(1) Since the sound film "Sister Flowers" directed by Zheng Zhengqiu of the Star Film Company was released on New Year's Eve, it has been sold out every day. According to statistics, the audience is close to 100,000. Calculated based on the 3 million citizens of Shanghai, on average, one out of every 30 people has seen "Sister Flowers." Its box office success is simply earth-shattering. It is certainly no problem to break all Chinese and foreign film box office records.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu has decided to direct three films this year: the first is "Streetwalker" (sound film), written by Ms. Yao Sufeng; the second is a remake of the Star Film Company's once sensational "Orchid in the Valley" ("Orchid in the Valley" was originally in two parts, now remade into one part; originally a silent film, now remade into a sound film); the third is a film adapted from Su Manshu's novel "The Tale of the Lonely Wild Goose." Regarding the adaptation of "The Tale of the Lonely Wild Goose," Mr. Liu Yazi, a friend of Manshu, has openly discussed it with Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu in this newspaper's "Free Talk." It is expected that the results of these three films will definitely be sensational.</p>
<p>(3) After completing his self-written and directed new works "Common Hatred" (starring Wang Ying, Yan Yuexian, and Chen Ningqiu) and "The Amorous History of Mount Hua" (starring Xu Lai, Gong Jianong, and Chen Ningqiu), Mr. Cheng Bugao immediately began preparing for his next work, "Go to the Northwest." This play was filmed on location on the Longhai Railway last year, and the script is highly valued by Mr. Cheng.</p>
<p>(4) "The Amorous History of Mount Hua" will be released in the New Light Theatre after "Sister Flowers." The background of this film is taken from Mount Hua, with its beautiful scenery; the story is full of poetry, and the director can indeed be described as "beautiful and exquisite, with flowers turning into brocade."</p>
<p>(5) The work of "Beauty of the White Mountains and Black Waters," directed by Mr. Xu Xinfu and starring Hu Die, Wang Zhengxin, and Gu Meijun, is extremely diligent, and more than half of it has now been filmed.</p>
<p>(6) After Li Pingqian sold "Golden Valley" and "Children of the Times," starring Ai Xia and Gao Qianping, his next film will be directed "Three Sisters," starring Hu Die, Yan Yuexian, Sun Min, and Zhao Dan. This film is rich in emotions and has a tortuous story. People in the company predict that it will definitely make money in the future.</p>
<p>(7) "Woman's Enemy" is a film co-directed by the couple Chen Kengran and Xu Qinfang, and is now about to be completed. Mr. Chen has put a lot of effort into directing this film.</p>
<p>(8) Shen Xiling's film "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours" has achieved amazing results, attracting much attention in the film industry. The new script "Smoke," which he has been working on for half a month, will soon be completed, and he will begin working on the set (the film set).</p>
<h3 id="e293">Jackie Coogan Still Continues Acting <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>

<p>Child prodigy Jackie Coogan, of course, can no longer be called a child prodigy or child star. He is now an adult and a college student at Santa Clara University. He hasn't made a film for a long time, but he hasn't forgotten his screen career. Now, during his weekly vacations, he is engaged in camera work. He is filming short films or newsreels about school life, etc. It is said that not long ago, he worked hard and had already filmed a dozen short films.</p>

<p>— Long Geng</p>
<p>Gao Yan told Xuejuan that Zhenxiao was just outside the door, how happy Xuejuan would be! She only felt that her heart was pouring hot blood into her whole body, but, after all, this could not become a reality. Zhenxiao was indeed outside the door, but he was tightly bound by soldiers. He was a serious criminal. Xuejuan's heart was filled with happiness, but at this moment, it was immediately driven away by horror. She wanted to rush forward, she wanted to throw herself into Zhenxiao's arms, she was crazy, she shouted crazily...</p>
<p>Under Gao Yan's hint, Lu Yuanfu groped for his pistol, preparing to shoot Lin Zhenxiao. —He had run close to Zhenxiao and covered his eyes with a handkerchief for him.</p>
<p>Xuejuan jumped wildly, like a carp being fried in a pot of oil, like... "Bang!" As the gunshot rang, Xuejuan fell into Gao Yan's arms, she fainted.</p>
<p>Gao Yan felt victorious! Laughed! —That smile was too ugly!</p>
<p>Just as Gao Yan's lips were approaching Xuejuan's — the lips of this fainted Xuejuan, suddenly, Xuejuan woke up, using her fists, hard, hard like a thunderous storm, she wildly knocked and beat Gao Yan's chest, knowing that this could not save her dead husband, but a feeling of "pain and anger" drove her to act so crazily. Of course, Gao Yan would not be angry, victory already completely belonged to him.</p>
<p>Xuejuan discovered the pistol on the table and immediately rushed forward to grab it, angrily, she pulled, pulled,... ah!</p>
<p>There were no bullets! Gao Yan on the other side looked at her and laughed!</p>
<p>While Xuejuan was trying to load the bullets, Gao Yan suddenly came over, tightly hugging her, preparing to enjoy her. Of course, Xuejuan was struggling, struggling, desperately struggling...</p>
<p>Suddenly, Gao Yan fell to the ground and died with a gunshot. Xuejuan was extremely surprised! When her suspicious gaze was released, Zhenxiao, —the Zhenxiao who had been shot, appeared outside the door led by Lu Yuanfu.</p>
<p>Not dead? Yes, Zhenxiao was not dead, Lu Yuanfu only fired a blank shot. So, Xuejuan laughed! At the same time, Zhenxiao and Yuanfu's hands were tightly, tightly, tightly held together.</p>
<p>The sound of knocking on the door was fierce. Lu Yuanfu wanted the pistol that Zhenxiao used to kill Gao Yan, had Zhenxiao put on Gao Yan's clothes, and led Xuejuan to escape.</p>
<p>When the door was knocked open, this repentant Yuanfu confessed that he was the murderer. He wanted to redeem his past sins with a spirit of great sacrifice, although he knew this was not enough.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Zhenxiao and Xuejuan embarked on the great road of revolution that they had long yearned for in their hearts. They said: "...It is useless to kill one Gao Yan, this is the whole problem." (End)</p>
