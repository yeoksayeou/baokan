<p>國府特派致祭達賴專使黄慕松氏。此次职道川康入藏。計其行程。當距拉薩未遠。（一説巳抵拉蕯。）黄氏嘗自言。（西藏遠　邊睡。内地消息。頗多隔闌。故余之前往。似無綫電然。使今後中藏發生通電作用。）吾人旣壯黄氏之行。遂亦切盼中藏懸案不久可有相機解决之望。</p>
<p>在今日之中藏間題中。最與我國有切身之利害者。當莫若康藏之紏紛。而個中　結所在。則厥爲界務。以界務間題之久懸未决。川邊藏番遂得時時入寇。而爲我西陲之大患。民廿。大白事件旣起。我軍驅藏番於金沙江之西岸。訂結（崗拖和約）。結果。始恢復金沙江東岸地。一時邊局得有小康之象。詎知至本年二月八日。藏方又藉口解决懸案。與我方代表會於矮達。會議中。提出苛刻條件。不惟欲撤廢（崗拖和約）。且欲割據德格甘瞻及巴安河西各地。我方拒不與議。而邊境之戰事又見。足徵邊情複雜。前途多難。正未可以樂觀。此次黄氏人藏。頗非易易。甚望政府乘此良機。根據史地鐵證。訓令黄氏。作爲交涉理由。而與藏方相折衝。嘗攷我國史乘。康人之内屬。薔繋始於兩漢。其疆域則東起打箭爐。西至丹　山。南與雲南之維西中甸兩廳接壤。北踰俄落色達野番。而與甘肅相交界。降至今日。番人之居於丹達山以東者。仍自稱爲康壩娃。居於丹達山以西者。自稱藏壩娃。尤足證明康藏之分界。實在於丹達山。即退一步而採取川康邊防總指揮劉文輝氏之意見。最低限度。亦當以昌都爲界。</p>
<p>吾人非不知自第十三達賴圓寂後。藏方之執政人員。實受英人之卵翼。其理想中之康藏界址。必不脱英人之主張。而所謂英人之主張。則早於民二三年之正式會議中見之矣。民二西姆拉會議。英人欲以打箭爐爲中藏之分界。民三德里會議。又欲截西藏爲内外二部。外藏别立一省。包有西藏及川邊之昌都。并設獨立政府。以總攬其實權。雖二次提案。我方迄未與以正式之承認。而彼方慾望之奢。則固巳昭然若揚。今由矮達會議之經過以觀。竊恐今後藏方之態度。未必遽能和綏。黄氏縱與交涉。結果似可逆料。惟我方立塲。則不容不確定耳。</p>
<p>與界務糾紛發生聯帶關係者。則爲西康之建省問題。年來。藏方勢力雖深入於康。而康人之對藏感情。則殊不見佳。在今年軍事期内。康中南金沙江以西各部康民嘗實行聯合。以反抗藏軍相號召。聞其目的則在要求西康之建省。嗣聞黄慕松氏行經康定之日。當地民衆亦嘗要求七事。其中一三兩項。即爲劃淸界限。以泯糾紛。充實經費。以建省治。黄氏據情轉呈中央。而中央則擬在經費未規劃妥善與康藏界務糾紛未完全解决前。先行設立西康政務委員會。以爲建省之過渡辦法。</p>
<p>言夫西建省。吾人乃憶及淸光緒三十二年（一九○六）後川滇邊務大臣趙爾豐氏之設施。當時趙氏覺邊區之重要。建省一舉。萬不容緩。其於軍事方面者。特辦四川汕糖兩捐。以爲軍餉的欵。政洽方面者。則請撥江海江漢兩關之庫平銀一百萬兩。以從事於（改土歸流）。軍事政洽。相輔而用。每得一地。即委定人員。調查戸口。淸理糧税。各種設備。相繼舉行。辛苦經營。越時七載。而後西康之行省。始略備雛形。爲今之計。當然以解决界務爲第一義。次之則籌劃軍餉。亦爲先務之急。查川邊軍餉。向由省庫補助。惟民六時代。川中揭南政府革命旗幟。獨陳遐齡鎭守川邊。附和北廷。以此關係。遂致省欵斷絶。陳氏無意備邊。而喪權辱國之絨壩岔停戰條件。於焉成立。今二劉關係之惡劣。巳臻極點。川邊軍餉之困難。亦確爲事實。似不能不有相當之補救。同時當由中央令行甘靑兩省。於必要之時。出師恊助。藉以鎭懾藏番。若軍事政治悉能璧劃有方。則藏方必不敢輕易内犯，不惟界務談判。可以增加力量。即西康建省前途。亦利賴之。國府關懷藏局。有目共鑒。當茲黄氏行將抵達拉薩之日。易勿就整個康藏問題。再一熱慮之乎。</p>

<p>自由談團結精神  微明　　二十多年前有些「志士」搖筆寫經世憂時的文章，敢怕總有這麽一句：「嗚呼，一盤散沙之國人！」爲什麽書是「一盤散沙」呢？没有推究下去。近來是推究到了，原來爲的没有團結精神。　　於是乎大家喊着「團結精神」，打着燈籠到處去找「團結精神」這件寳貝。　　其實在小百姓看來，這是無謂，他們所信仰。却簡單得很；不吃飯就活不下去。　　譬如今年夏季，江浙一帶鬧旱災，然而黄河沿岸却鬧大水；旱災地帶的小百姓，希望多下點雨，水災地方的小百姓却惟恐其下雨。雖使聖人復生，也不能呌這利害完全相反的人們把他們集合起來。　　等面言之，軍閥和官僚，店東和小夥計，討債人和欠債人，嫖客和妓女，坐車的和拉車的，···他們是不能團結起來的。　　倘使要在這些家常便飯的淺近道理以外，再找個微妙高深的抽象東西出來，又從而家喻戸曉之，那卽使能收效於一時；但等到肚子餓了時，那最原始的共仰還是要泛起來的：不吃飯就活不下去。　　然面有些人仍喜歡（而且感得必要）找個抽象的東西來呌餓肚子的人們去信仰，這也是可異的事。紅毛  林稜　　和故鄕告别的一天，也正是與我那灰色的童年永訣的日子，於今巳整整四年了。偶然憶起故鄕，那埋葬着我不幸的童年的故鄕底山色，河流，兒時的遊伴···這些好像全隠伏在霧裏了。　　可是我的小鄰居紅毛，郤例外地到而今還是深深地留在記憶裏。她是一個圓圓的小臉兒，圓圓的大眼睛，年紀與我相彷彿的孩子。她那帶紅的頭髮從不曾結過小辮子，也像從不曾上過油，亂糟糟的披在頭上，眉上，因此人家呌她「紅毛」。在遊伴中，我特别喜歡她，不僅爲了她有那末奇怪的大眼睛，和那小圓臉兒，連她那亂蓬蓬的頭髮，髒得要命的臉兒，我都喜歡。可是母親却非常固執地禁止我和紅毛一起玩，自然，後來我只好背着母親跑到後園去，在牆邊悄悄地呌着：「紅毛！紅毛·」她來了，我們兩個兒便都快活得如才被放到人間來的小天使般。我們採着各種各樣的野花，互相往頭上挿着，捉着美麗的粉蝶，和種種不知名的飛虫，玩一會兒我們又放去。口裏唱着連自己也不能解的小曲兒，常常玩得忘了吃飯的時間，常常挨母親的駡。　　有一次，不知那個惡作劇的孩子，做了母親的密探，我被告發了。正當我們唱着連自己也不解的小曲兒，採着野花的時候，我給母親捉住了：捉着回去還挨了一頓狠狠的打。母親還駡着：「喜歡跟她一起，索性不要回我的家來：跟她做小偷兒去吧｜」這才，從母親的談話裏知道了，紅毛常常偷鄰居們的東西吃；這就是母親不許我和她一起玩的理由。自然哪！那時我也憎厭起她來了；爲什末要偷東西吃？爲什麽不向母親要，像别的孩子們一樣。　　一天我又遇着紅毛在路上，我們已不像往日那般高興，親熱，這兩個小精靈不知給什末東西隔開了，我問她：「爲什末要偷别人的東西吃？」她的回答是：「因爲肚子餓了！」這時，我已有着和母親們一樣的成見，總不以爲「偷東西」是可以饒恕的事，我不跟她説話，只默默地跟着她跑到她的「家去」。那兒是一個又低又破的小屋，屋子裏充滿了黑暗和悽凉，郤在黑暗的解落裏，躺着的是紅毛的父親，巳經殘疾了的父親。其他什末都看不見。我害怕了，一徑跑回自己的家來　　不幾天我被送到一個離家三十里的縣城女子小學校讀書去了。　　寒假才回家來，當天的旁晚，就跑到後園去在那牆邊悄悄地呌：「紅毛！紅毛！」回答是一片悽凉的沉寂，我踏着地上的零葉，走遍了後園，試尋那日紛飛的粉蝶，鮮麗的野花···可是這些也和紅毛的影子一同消失了！那時節，我那一顆天眞的小心兒，眞不知如何地寂寞呵後來聽四叔母説：「紅毛巳賣給張家當使女了，因爲她那殘疾的父親死了，没錢埋葬····」我還聽人説紅毛的父親曾在張家做了五年的「長工」，後來因挑過重的担子把脚跌壞了一隻，不能再做工了，才給辭退的。往後幾年全靠紅毛的母親天天替人洗衣裳，得一兩升米回來養活他們父子，當然，他們是多半吃不飽的。　　時間帶着所有的孩子們，離開了夢幻般的童年，飛快的往成年的世界裏奔去，殘酷的「現實」，硬拉着我們去和社會認識，於是，人世間的善與惡光明與黑暗，全在我們的面前展開了，使我們知道自己是活在如何不合理的社會裏。　　我看着多少潔白的人們，被這不合理的社會强迫着去做自己不願做的事，因而給另一種人冷視，憎厭。我就記起紅毛來了，這個潔白小靈魂，在什末都不曾認識之先社會就强迫着她去做小偷兒，因此遭了那些豐衣足食的人們底冷視，憎惡，正如許多不幸的人們一樣。現在，她是和我一樣地成人了，我不知道她將被迫着去做什末了呢。　　想着這此，我的心是怎樣的沉重，而且茫然呵！弟弟（八）  周文　　後來才知道弟弟眞比我胆大。當那些弁兵衝鋒的時候，呌他不要去，他答應了，然面終於也跟着他們的屁股後走去。等到衝過橋的時候，才發現他　離橋兩三丈遠的黄菜花林中鑽了出來。嘴唇烏白，不説話，跟着走了。　　後來我們雖是同一個部隊住了四年，然而説話的時間是很少的。他挨了親戚的打的時候，他簡直不告訴我；就是他病了，也在幾天後才使我知道。我要他到我的床上去，他不；我只好在他的墊着　床蓆子的板床前看守他。問他爲甚麽挨了打，他只是不高興的説道「那裏那裏」，不好意思地臉就轉向牆壁那面去。雖然後來也聽見他向别人批評我，（那是當他要進軍官學校前幾天的事了。）説我身體太弱，説我不該抽烟，而且説我没有打算這軍官學校｜｜「現在只有軍官學校才是出路的！」他説。這些話我雖然聽見不高興，可是弟弟已經有點不像往時了。　　有一天在街上有一個弁兵喊他：　　「喂，小周！打牌去嘛！」　　他只懶懶地鼻音敷衍一聲：　　「唔，我還有事。」就趕快三步兩步的走了。　　好久不見，這使我倒很奇怪；後來想，其　也並不奇怪甚麽。不是他巳經進了軍官學校了麽？　　每逢放星期，他出街，也拴斜皮帶。然而剛剛走出校門，他開頭還直率地同着那些同一間寢室的同學問；　　「喂，看戲去麽？」　　人家却没有理，走了。他於是就孤伶伶地剩在那兒。後來他漸漸就把直率改爲搭赸搭赸了。然而到我房裏來的時候就漸漸的多了些，而且居然開始呌我哥哥了。雖然，他還是常常帶着一付幽怨的表情説道：　　「我很悔，早不該當了弁兵，而且也没有讀過書！」海鷗  蒲風　　海鷗追着船飛，低低的逐着水面，急急的撲向浪裏，好像靜留在空中，飛，飛，是並着船追。不怕前後左右茫茫一片水，抓碎了多少泡沫，撲空打不消追求的願望；没有貪圖水上片刻的休息，一邊在唱，一邊在低翔！｜｜不倦地追，不倦地追！　　七，二八於海上。記莉莉·珂貝（續）（二）  徐懋庸　　在吃飯的中間，自然也有人考間她·題目是「德國文壇的現狀」。她的答案是：　　「德國的較好的作家們，除了被希特拉趕出國外的，都巳進到Konsenftaionilager去了。所以，現在的德國人，假如想要一篇好的小説或者一個好的電影脚本，那麽必須到Konlcntrasionslager去找去。」　　所謂Konrentrasionslager據替她翻譯的P先生的解釋，本來是「集中工塲」或者「集中兵營」的意思，但現在是容納犯人的處所，犯人在這裏面是有工做的，直白地説就是牢監了。　　牠説上面的一段話的時候，引起了大家老哄笑，因爲後面兩句是近於幽默的。　　關於德國文壇的狀况，她後來曾寫下一篇文章，給了文學社。　　四　　那晚吃過了飯之後；席上推定了任先生和我，陪她回美國學堂去。這是一個難題，因爲我們兩人都不會説她所懂得的話，我雖然能説幾句法語，但不過幾句，所以在席中的時候，我總不肯使用，所説的話都是請Ｐ先生翻譯的。這回被派了這個差使，而且她説願意一同徒步回去，從南京路到聖母院路，距離是頗長的，這樣的長途中若竟不説一句話，總過不去，因此只好竭力攫索語彙記憶語法，以備臨時應對　　從南京路轉到西藏路時候，她忽然問我：　　「現在到了什麽路了？」　　我是，連Ｔ這個名詞，也要經一分鐘纔能答得出。　　大槪是因爲看到我的外國語程度之淺　而發的罷？她問：　　「你在大學讀過書麽？」　　「不曾，因爲我很窮。」　　「你有多少年紀了？」　　「二十五，你呢？」　　「三十。」　　聽｜這話，我瞧着任先生笑了一笑，他老是愛呌她女孩子的。　　「我很想到你在做工的那個國家上看看呢？」這回是我先提起話頭。　　「很好的，你去不去呢？」　　「但是我不能去。」　　「爲什麽？」　　「因爲我很窮。没有旅費。」　　「哦，哦！」　　可是我忽然想到她也是很窮的，而竟能這一國那一國的跑來跑去。以窮作爲不能達到某種志願的理由，在她是不大容易相信的罷？我聽她「哦，哦！」之後没有下文，回頭去看，她是低着頭像是在思索什麽了。　　五　　東方飯店的門口，一個行乞的孩子，在拉胡琴，拉出來的是孟姜女的調子，這使得珂貝竟停下步來，傾聽良久，對我説了大槪的話。可是我所聽懂的還不到三分之一：　　「這個孩子，······他的音樂，爲什麽這樣悲悽？·····道是太悲悽了······民衆的音樂·····俄國的民衆音樂雖然也有這樣悲悽的，可是寫有反抗的力量。這個孩子所奏的是｜｜一點也没有力·····」　　這以下我是完全聽不懂了，似乎還有問話，我也不能回答。　　看到從遠東飯唐出來的一個單身的妖冶的女人時，她問我，這是怎樣的女人？　　「是·····」　　「是Ｐlostituce麽？」　　「是···的。」　然據我看來，那是一個正經人家的摩登小姐，不過因爲一時想不出話來解辨，也就馬馬虎虎地肯定了。　　正當這樣説着的時候，大批的「野雞」就到了眼前。我們三個，要到大世界門口去趁公共汽車，必須從「野雞」羣中擠過。在挨擠中，我對珂貝説明我們固園的女人盡是Ｐrostituee，這倒使她吃了一驚，仔細地觀察起來。有幾個野雞」，看到一個外國女人這樣的注意她們指指點點地似乎頗覺有趣，但是我有點怕了，便急忙催着穿過愛多亞路。　　一路上，她總是注意種種事情。我們雖然不能用語言替她解釋一切，但在這一次的散步中使她有看到一些實際的事物的機會、她用了自己的眼睛和自己的感覺，理解了上海的一部分　　六　　離滬之前，她爲了文學社寫了一篇文章，外贈照片一張。爲我所編的新語林，她寫了散文一篇··睡着了的上海，外加贈詩一首，致新語林讀者辭一通，以及蘇俄某畫家替她畫的像一幀。　　由她向文學社索取稿費這一件事，是可以看出她的窮困的，但她向我却不能同樣地要求，因爲她早已要我寫一篇關於中國文壇現狀的文章給她了。幸而有這一塲交易，否則，假如她向我要起稿費來，我是很爲難的，因爲新語林這個刋物實在太窮了。　　她的像和詩，巳經刋登新語林第三期，睡着了的上海，則登在第四期。從這些文字裏，我們可以看出這個「女孩子」，實在是我們的朋友。她雖然悄悄地來，悄悄地去，絶不爲人所注意，然而凡是讀到她的文字而認識了她的思想和對中國的好意的人，一定都要感激的。　　她贈新語林的詩和致新語林讀者辭，現在轉錄在這里··　　（一）贈新語林詩　　西方的科學和東方的熱心，將解放全世界｜　　　　（二）致新語林讀者辭　　　　你們幸福的中國人，現在全世界的運命都揑在你們的手裏，如果你們自由了，那麽，在西方的你們的弟兄們的鐐錢也就粉碎了。所以我們的心，是和你們在大戰鬭中一同鼓動的。（完）</p>

<p>春秋小西天  張恨水著　　第五回　鬼載一車關中來遠客家徒四壁渡口吊秦人　　忽　得　　　　　　：吳廳長來了。他　到之後，　裏就是一跳。什麽廳長？是財政廳長呢？是民政廳長呢？自己並没有去拜會廳長的資格，廳長當然不能先來探望，必是拜訪别個房間的人了。果然，這就聽到隔壁屋子裏的人，迎了出去，笑道：請進來罷，我巳經等候你老哥三小時了。李士廉聽那口音，正是先前打招呼的那位程志前。他稱廳長爲你老哥，却是有相當的身分，不能不向下聽，於是摒去一切胡亂的思想，靜靜向下聽。説了許久，才知道這位廳長是管學生的，並不能派税局給人去作。後來又聽到那吳廳長問：今天見過主席没有？程志前答：主席對於文人，那是太客氣，今天上午，又請了我吃飯。李士谦想着：哦呵！主席都請他吃飯，這位程先生，必有相當的身分，還是和他聯絡些的好！繼續着又聽到那吳廳長道：你還有什麽地方要去看看的嗎？程志前道：我想到周陵去看看，不知道有車子没有？吳廳長笑道：你老哥是多年老朋友，這點事還成什麽問題，明天把我自己的車子送你去罷。我那車子，總可以坐四個人，假如你有朋友的話，可以同去。明天是禮拜，説不定我陪你走一趟。程志前謙遜了兩句，這事就决定了。李士廉聽到程志前送客向院子外走，自己也就搶了出來。眞是莫道君行早，更有早行人。那位張介夫先生，早是在廊檐下等着。大槪程志前和吳廳長所談的話，他也完全聽到了，這也不去管他，等到程志前回來，就迎上前問道：程先生晚飯用過了。（一一）老虎湯  寒玉　　老虎竈是依着平民的需要而發生的營業；老虎湯是老虎竈應平民需要的副業。　　每逢夏天，在每個老虎竈的門前，都掛着一隻破舊的燈籠，就是老虎湯的標記。也許這燈籠巳經雙成十分的破舊，連淸水盆湯四個字也看不淸，但是平民望見了它，就知道是平民浴室的所在地老虎竈屋子的後面、特地劃出些地主來，佈置着巳經替老闆賺了許多錢的破木桶，就是老虎湯唯一的資本。爲了要隔住外面的視綫起見，用布蔽住了。但是到後來，也成爲老虎湯的特别標幟。　　一天的工作，尤其是在這六十年未有的炎威之下，身體裏面的垢污，早隨着汗液，被熱力擠到體外來。當然，沐浴是免不掉的事實·但是住在鴿籠式的屋子裏，猶有空的地方可以沐浴。所以老虎湯就成了平民的唯一夏令浴室了。每天傍晚或是晚上，總有許多人拿了衣服，走向老虎竈裏面去，就是平民浴室的主顧。他們爲了去掉他們垢污的緣故，就不得不去享受富人没福受到的老虎湯，雖然一次洗澡的價錢，巳從七八個銅元長到十二三個了。　　秋天雖然隨着屋角的蟲聲而來臨，天氣仍是勢得什麽似的，老虎湯的生意仍是不改夏天，這是老閶應該快活的事。但是一想到寒冷就要到的時候，他門的快樂又漸漸地消滅了。點滴  （陶珏）　　　春夜宜讀西廂；夏夜宜讀聊齋；秋夜宜讀唐詩；冬夜宜讀紅樓。　　蘇文忠髑髏贊曰，黄沙枯髑髏，本是桃李面，而今不忍看，當時恨不見。讀此數語，可以悟色即是空之旨。吃長素的傅太太  馬嬰　　只要在這裏住上一個月的人，便會知道這裏有一個好人，那就是傅太太。伊的被人承認爲好人的條件，就是吃長素；不是嗎，吃長素的人是最慈悲的。　　傅太太是吃長年素的。據伊自巳説，她從三十歲起，筷頭就没有沾過一點葷腥呢。伊本來並没有吃素的意思，只因爲伊三十歲的那年，忽然生了一塲病，幾乎死去，後來做了一個夢，説是夢見一個和尙對伊説，伊的病是因爲從前吃肉吃多了。伊醒來一想，認那個和尙一定是如來佛。便立誓水遠吃素，果然伊就慢慢地好起來了。　　伊的家裏有一個小小的佛龕，裏面供着如來佛的牌位。面前有一個草織的蒲圑，也像基督敎徒早禱晚禱一樣，伊在早上和晚上兩個時間，都要跪在蒲團上誦一千遍佛號。　　可是，伊待媳婦並不仁慈，而且比别人還惡虐，伊每天除了早禱晚禱之外，餘下的時間，便都拿來駡媳婦和隣舍吵架咧。什麽人都怕伊，因爲伊駡起人來是最恶毒不過的。　　伊的媳婦，那可憐的小婦人，在這淫威壓迫之下，臉兒是漸漸地憔悴，消瘦下去了。御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　那末，儘讓伊獨自去思索着吧，這也不行！或者伊竟會越想越惱，以至於怒火上升，不可遏止：到這地步，我們這些服侍着伊的人，便倒老了，時常會無辜而忽遭毒駡的。所以我們每在伊開始深思默念之初，便急急用有趣味的話去擾亂伊，使伊不致想得太苦；而這一項艱難的工作，别人都不肯輕易嘗試，往往總由我去擔任。但是這當兒，我倒很希望伊能够多想一會，再發表一些特殊的見角；因此我並不就去擾亂伊，隔了半嚮，伊果然用很低而很沉痛的語音，向我説道：　　「這是多麽的可憐啊」！伊一面説，一面隔着車窗，指着那些並無人前去祭奠或拜謁的荒墳。「在這些土饅頭裏所長眠着的人，不但在生前因爲太窮的緣故，受盡了種種的痛苦；就是在死了之後，也因毫無遺産能够補助他的子孫，以致他的子孫，也鬧得跟他自己一樣的窮，甚至連掃墓的力量也没有，我們眞不能不予以相當的憐憫！可是打另一方面想一想，人死去之後，眞會有什麽感覺嗎？還不是每個死人都是一樣嗎！譬如我們如今是多麽顧赫啊？然而待到腿兒伸直，一切便都完了！及至埋到了泥土中去，血肉逐漸腐爛，誰還能分辨得出這些是天潢貴胄的遺骸，那些是下等平民的枯骨···。我們不難想到這些一貧澈骨的人的墳墓，倘不是附近地方上的慈善家肯慷慨解囊的話，恐怕還不能堆成功咧！所以卽使這些墳墓因爲乏人照料而坍毁，他們的子孫，也祇能睜大着眼睛流涙，非得再有好善的人出來援助，便没法修整。（一二○）生活犧牲者  一震　　餐桌上，新置了個玻璃的蒼蠅罩子，罩下放了些糖食，立刻這糖食勾引來了不少的顧客！蒼蠅。當它們儘量地飽餐後，擦擦嘴巴振振翅膀上飛時，恰巧飛在罩裏，一個，二個，三個·····都溜進罩裏，它們再也不能從原路飛出，於是瘋狂地慌亂地在玻璃罩上亂撞，滿蓄着撞破玻璃的雄心。感到疲倦時，才跌入水裏，在水裏也經過一度的崢扎，終於挺起肚子死了。　　我起初置辦蒼蠅罩子，是感覺到它們太狡猾，太骯髒的緣故，想「殺一以警百」，但想不到貪婪的它們，爲了生活所迫，雖明明看見同類在罩裏慌亂的情態，但决不能取爲前車之鑒，仍舊蜂擁上來，先後落入陷阱；這樣我倒意識到自己是太殘忍，太卑鄙的舉動，去殺害一種無知無識的蠢物。在這種感觸之下，於是我大聲的告訴它們：「朋友！下面安然的有條出路呀！依循着這路程脱離這陷阱吧！」　　但是愚笨的朋友，自己不能找尋出路，也不能按照别人所指示的去實行，呵！生活陷阱下的犧牲者，出路是明明的展開着，只要自己作有用的掙扎吧！　　但是蒼蠅，依舊一羣一羣地給食餌所勾引，依舊一羣一羣地向罩内溜進。岀路？  月　人影偶剪  （沈瘦若）　　人心地裏總是殘忍的，或許慈善在面孔上；但有種人連慈善面孔都没有。　　人都是有理的，世界上絶對没有無理的人。一公説公有理，婆説婆有理。」的二句俗諺名言，就可證明人都是有理的。　　人在現代社會是絶對無私的。你看一切事物像公尺，公斤，公司，公寓，公路，公園，公坑等等，無一不公；大有「公爾忘私」的狀况！世界珍聞  （冰玉）　　最古的聖書　　倫敦的大英博物館中，最近從蘇俄買進了世界最古的聖典，呌做西那，價値英金十萬鎊，該館得了這部珍本以後，參觀者人山人海，每天入塲費，總有幾千鎊收入，不到半個月，就收回十萬鎊的資本了。聽説這部手寫聖書，是在千六百餘年以前，用希臘文寫的，與藏在羅馬法王廳内的佛蒂甘聖典相並稱，以精巧羊皮紙，寫滿三百八十八頁，一千八百五十八年，德國聖書學者齊舍因特羅天，在巴來司坦英南方西那山麓的寺院中發見，後來由寺僧輾轉獻給俄國皇帝，等到蘇維埃政府成立，先爲美國人探知，曾經幾次接洽，因爲價値不合，交易不成，現在竟落在英國的手中了。　　最大的廣告　　德國伊凱渠料工業股份公司在萊因河畔開隆市外所設的雷佩爾克工塲，去年三月，招待内外新聞記者，是日在工塲内，建設世界最大的空中廣告，就是以五五米的距離，並立電燈，有一二六米的高度，一萬二千頓的重量，用電綫網裝在工廠的兩個烟囱間，裝成拜耳的十字形Ｂayer在字的周圍，成一大圓形，大圓形中，有二千二百二十個電燈，（就是與現在拜耳藥房所出的商標同形的）其直徑爲七十二米，周圍二百二十米，各個文字的高，爲十二米。　　最高的身長　　英國有一位長人，名呌加米爾康，他的身長，達十一呎三吋，爲全世界打破紀錄的第一長人，聽説他在五歲時候巳有五呎餘長，其後隔了二年，總可長到一呎，因爲他的身長的緣故，不論起居坐臥，都要受種種損失，譬和桌椅，床凳，也須特别製造的。　　最古的森林　　日本常川縣的魚津港，最近發現了世界最古的大森林，這大森林已沉到海底，變爲化石林，據考古學者的研究，因爲太古時代，地殼變動，就把這大森林埋没海中，樹木的根幹，周圍有三四丈，合計有八十餘株。現在日政府想修築魚津港，而該國地質學家脇水鐵五郎博士，深恐修築時，損壞原形，聯合地方篤志家，極力運動保存，日本文部省已准許其請，指定爲天然紀念物區。　　最大的鳥龜　　南美喀拉巴可士島中，發現了世界未見的大鳥龜，身長四呎，重約五百五十鎊，差不多與最大的龜龜相類，最奇者，背上的十八塊甲上，都爲水底昆蟲做窠棲息，也有珊瑚生在上面的。　　最小的侏儒　　住在美國洛桑磯有一位希奇的人，名呌加爾，本來是捷克斯拉夫種，今年是二十歲，身長祇有三尺九寸，體重十三斤，好比二歲的小兒一樣的，不過他的言語動作，與成年無異。　　最長的鐵橋　　在南歐保加利里士本方面的裴利亞半島的達求河，最近架設了世界最長的鐵橋，距里士本市東方一哩爲起點，長達六哩半，保加利政府爲建築這橋，向英法德三國借欵九百萬元，現今巳開始興工了。　　最大的食量　　全世界有名的大食家史戴芬克，每天起碼要吃鷄蛋三十個，肉類三十斤，葡萄酒二十瓶，最近忽然食慾减退，致病而死，聽説其身長六呎六吋，體重二百九十五鎊。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言皇后歌片  瓊聲　　我們在上海　雜的人，從噪耳的無綫電中，佈滿脂粉氣息的電影院裏，以及留聲機唱片，常常聽到一九三三年「皇后」的「最後一聲」，一九三四年「皇后」的「我的寳貝要睡覺」。其音調之婉曼，總使人感到十二萬分的肌肉酥麻，心裏激憤；因爲這些無憂無慮的淸歌，配合在這多難之邦的環境裏，實在是「靡靡傷志」。本屐朋友的廣播電台，被運用來喊「一九三六年危機到來全國人民作速準備」的口號，發人警醒：咱們的播音機却發送各種的諷經禮懺，「搖搖賓貝睡一覺」的歌辭，令人麻醉，這着實使我佩服「國故」先生們所倡導的「中學爲體，西學爲用」的功德。而且在此對照比擬之下，别人確乎在積極的進行「非常時」對策，我國的許多「賓貝」，眞的也就在此淸歌妙樂中「睡着了」。　　聰明的木屐朋友，大致鑒於我們的皇后歌曲「催眠」的效力，眼看着無法勦滅的東北義勇，及日思反抗的東北人民，也起而傚尤，用皇后歌辭來實行「灌迷魂湯」的工作。記得去年三月一日提綫京戲在長春開幕之時、身任國務總理而兼日「滿」文化恊會會長的鄭孝胥，曾編「國歌」一首，以作開塲之白。其詞云：「天地間，有了新滿洲，新滿洲，便是新天地：頂天立地，無苦無憂，造成我國家，只有親愛，並無怨仇！人民三千萬，人民三千萬，縱加十倍，也得自由！重仁義尙禮讓，使我身修。家巳齊，國巳治，此外何求，近之則與世界同化，遠之則與天地同流一。當然所謂無苦無憂，只有親愛，並無怨仇等鬼話，均洽洽是「新滿洲」實際情形的反面註解，這種十全大補的湯頭，非但不能使啼飢號寒的東北人民受服，而且起着極大的「反蒭」作用。因之日本於利用「眞命」的溥儀來獲取愚民之外，又抬出正六宮的溥儀老婆來施行「皇后」催眠曲了。　　報載日人以滿洲「國歌」歌詞恭順，欲使之普及民間，乃商由溥儀妻歌唱此國歌，另由恭親王之女芳子歌唱日文翻譯之曲，一併交由日商哥倫比亞話片公司灌入留聲機話片中，除每日由電台廣播外，並迫令商民購此片歌唱，以廣宣傳云云。是的，女人常有傾國傾城的本領，東北人民於聽了這毫不冒牌的「皇后」淸歌一　之後，確有些人會迷迷糊糊，頗覺自落「無苦無憂」之境，然而這些人不是熙洽臧式毅呂榮寰之流，便是其他的名公巨賈。正如我們聽了電影皇后淸歌就覺得有些「醍　貫頂」的人，絶不是經濟力量使之不能買收音機留聲片的小子。　　其實這種春夢沈酣的事，又何止此！對於女人尊之以皇后總統明星花等舉國景崇的現象，普遍各地不用説，而且景仰所在，以至雖執鞭之事吾亦爲之」：這種没落情形，不僅如當年李後主的「不要江山要美人」，並且連自己腦袋也不要，除了太息，還説甚麽？一家三口　　太陽的赤臉，發着炎威底照耀着大地，天空上只一片的蔚藍色，白色的浮雲，好似不會移動般的掛在那西方的山尖上。　　一片黄褐色的平原，在這太陽的熱光之下，一切的景物都在沉寂着。一只有那大樹下的狗兒，吐出着個舌頭在喘息着。　　早在這裏都充滿着旱的景象；河中的泥土，巳枯涸的没有一點兒水，田野裏的禾苗，都萎黄得如亂草般的塌倒，田中的泥土，也現出着一條條的龜痕，那樹尖上的葉兒，雖未到秋天枯黄落葉的時候，但都給太陽晒得乾乾的變成棕黄色了。　　是嚮午的時候了，那村莊中的人都在準備吃午飯了。但那長短叢亂，參差不齊的烟囱，却有着很多是連一點白烟飛起都没有。黑烟飛出處，就有着無數的人，注着眼睛的流着白泡的口水了。　　四老爺的那一座高大的房子，今天的兩扇朱紅色漆得油光光的大門，却特别的打開了。這兩扇大門自今年入夏大旱以來，從來就没開過，今天的破例，合村的人都覺得奇怪了；雖然門口站立着兩位門神般威武的兵老爺，但那些好奇的農夫村婦，還是個個探着那做賊似的眼光去觀望。　　「昨天本鄕的周老爺家裏，才鬧了一次搶米的事，還打死了一個兵老爺，今天四老爺還這樣的舖張，説不定給那些人看上了，就是多幾個兵老爺，也是要吃虧的。一村中的人都這樣的在議論着。　　老和這時候從家裏跑出來，他想家裏一粒米都没有，從昨天　到了今天，只好再去向四老爺求借，别路是再也没辦法了。　　「噲，老和：你到什麽地方去呀！這樣的急幹麽？」　　「呀！五老哥，别説了吧，家裏一粒米都没有，巳餓了了一整天，那還有什麽辦法呢？不出來走動走動，還在家裏等死嗎？」　　老和口裏在和五老哥説話，脚底下却是不停的向前走，看看已到了四老爺的門口，他的心就忐忑起來，脚步也就慢下來了。他心裏想：「前年鬧大水，弄得一點收成都没有，去年又收成不好，今年又這樣的旱災，看看秋收也是無望了。四老爺給我作的這七畝田，從前年到現在，也不知欠了多少租了。今年立春到現在，又借了他二十塊錢和幾石米，現在還想向他借米，那他還會借給我嗎？」想着就是一身冷汗，但爲了家中的妻子和小孩的將要餓死，他也只好頂着頭皮去給四老爺磕頭，求求再救濟一次。他這時就鼓起了勇氣的走進四老爺那座高大的房子的邊門。　　一刹那的工夫，老和巳經一步一步好似死屍拖着廣索似的從内面出來，剛才進去時他臉上浮現着的那一副帶着希望，畏懼，悲悽，可憐的情形，現在是變了一個樣子了。他兩手空空地低着頭喘着氣。哭喪着臉的表現着他是絶望的了。　　雖是將近黄昏的時候了，那太陽却還是在發着焱威，地面給晒得好似火一般的熱，老和垂頭喪氣的走出了村門，望着他那靠着吃飯的田裏走去。　　禾苗是一片的黄褐色，再也没有希望他活的可能了。他坐到那右邊的枯樹下，望着那七畝枯黄的田地，撫摸着自巳的下腮出神的嘆氣。　　「借幾升米救救人命不答應，還要大駡一頓。弄了那未好的酒肉，請了那們一位什麽區老爺吃飯就是應該的嗎？」老和低聲的自言自語的在駡着四老爺。　　太陽溜到地平綫下去了。老和帶了一些從水灘上摘來的斷腸草，進村門，望着家裏走去了。　　夜過了，太陽又現出了赤臉照上大地了。老和一家三口的死訊就在這天傳遍了全村。趨時  覺夫　　剛從巴黎運到最新式的服裝，馬上就購牠一二套來穿穿；當「普羅」或「幽默」最膾炙人口的當兒，馬上就榨盡腦汁，來呌幾個口號，説幾句俏皮話兒；····這之類，就所謂「趨時」。一個人，做事行動能够處處與「時」符合，是會被人家以另眼相視，到處討便宜的；甚且，人家以「先進分子」，「站在時代的前頭」，····這些漂亮名詞來相稱呼，也是常有的事。如果不問人世的風尙如何，老是穿着一件破舊袍子，不管文壇上的派頭變化怎樣，老是提起筆來説自己心中所要説的話，····這種人，就所謂之「落伍」。落伍的人，到處是碰壁和釘子。　　趨時是好的，誰都曉得。我們中國，每回換一個新花樣，就有不少人擁護，原因就在這裏。　　但是，趨時也是有點小毛病的；因爲一個人的脾胃和體質，一成了習慣，就不大容易改變過來的。打個譬方來説吧。　　前些時，女人如能將胸束得平平的，脚纒得只有二三寸長，這算是十足的趨時的了：及至一旦轉變而爲袒胸天脚的時代，胸雖然不束了，脚雖然釋放了；但，終弄得三四不像，趕不上未曾受過苦的人的來得合時。　　「五四」的先後，三角四角的戀愛小説，非是時髦極了，一班趨時的作家，也都盡向這方面賣力，過無多時，文學的趨勢，一變而爲革命文學，這些慣寫戀愛小説的能手，雖竭力來學習將寫作普羅化，但，「妹妹我愛你」呀，「我的心肝」呀，·····這一堆怪肉麻的口禪，終不能剔括得一乾二凈：頂多也不過只能寫成千篇一律的「革命和戀愛」的東西而巳。　　從一班趨時的人物的口中，也常能聽見吐露出「做人實在不易」的説話，這更足見不易改變的習慣的害人處了。　　不過，這或許也只是多數多心人的過慮　吧？在一　　　的中國，每扮回新花樣，能够等到大家都學成習慣這是很少見的事。這一點、也就趨時者羣，生長在中國的便宜處。</p>

<p>雨夜  驊　　天空是黑沉沉地，佈滿了崇山峻嶺似的惡雲，大雨如注地傾瀉。　　霎那間地上積水成河。　　雨，在這久旱的奇熱的季節，洒遍了燒焦的地皮。雨，眞長天地間萬物的救星。　　我披衣起牀，開了房門，欣賞那院落的浪花泡沫。積水因雨點的打撃發着波濤巨響。一股雨過淸新的空氣，鑽進了我的鼻腔。　　我恐懼了。院落的水幾乎與台階成了水平綫了。若溢進我的房舍，那可糟了。　　在這久旱喜雨的當兒心靈又起了一種説不出的驚悸。　　雨，是有益於人的，然而暴雨，却能毁滅了人的生命。　　雨，只管拚命的下着。　　大地間除了雨的呼聲，電的光明，一切寂靜的臥在黑越越的夜幕中。　　我斜倚門檻，注視那院落的一片汪洋的雨水，那水發着燦爛的明光。　　因暴雨的任性傾瀉，引起了我許多的雜亂的思想。　　回到床上，停息了一切念頭，將注意力集中到汪洋的院落内的雨水澎湃地聲浪上，好像大水一霎時流留進我的屋内。　　在睡眼朦朧中，猶聽見那滴簷的積水叮噹叮噹地響着。接觸一下的愉快  亦菴業餘信箱言論自由與做日記編者先生：　　我常常看見業餘信箱替人解答難題，不但適當，而且詳細，我是非常欽佩。　　我是一個幼年失學的靑年，因爲受家鄕惡劣的情勢所迫，在各處飄泊巳經有六七年了，可説是受盡了人生的一切痛苦。我對於讀書極感興趣，但又爲困苦的環境所限，只有從自修上求得一點些微的學識，最近我想做做日記，因爲（一）可以練習作文（二）可以使每日的事情，不致遺忘。但是我現在是依人過活，一切都不自由。日前偶然寫了幾句感傷的字句放在棹上，被别人看見了，似乎十人不悦。我想，假使我把所受的委屈和人情刻薄的感想都寫在日記上，而被他們看見了，豈不是連飯碗都要打破嗎？所以我就不敢寫日記了，但是心裏却十分苦悶。現在我有三個問題寫在下面，請先生加以答覆。　　（一）現在的中國人民有没有言論的自由？　　（二）日記應該怎樣寫法？我認爲寫日記不把所受的刺激寫進去，似乎太無意思，但又有很多困難。不知用何寫法，能使對方看見不失氣，而不失去自由發揮的目的。　　（三）我想寫小品文寄給貴報，先生能代爲删改付刋否？　　專上敬請　撰安　杏桃上　　編者按：杏桃君在困苦的環境中，能够顧到自修學識，和寫日記，實在是難能可貴。現在把他所詢問題，答覆於後：　　（一）在中國法律上承認每個國民都有言論，出版，結社，集會，居住等等自由。我們應當享有這些權利。　　（二）自己的日記是要將自己生活中所感觸到的一切事實爲出發點，坦白的，率直的描寫出來，不應有絲毫的虚僞；否則，就失去日記的價値了。但是日記的材料也不應限於人情刻薄的紀述，你應當把它擴大到社會大衆生活實况的描寫。要知道人情刻薄是現社會應有的現象，要把它看作很平常的一回事，不要因爲受了人家的冷眼就感覺過分的苦悶。日記本來不必給别人看見，但我猜想你的環境所給你的自由也許很少，假使你爲了寫日記而時時有妨礙吃飯問題的危險，還是以不寫爲佳。但是你寫日記，能够從大處看想，不直接攻撃你所依靠的人，那末或者就不會發生什麽問題了。　　（三）你可以多寫點小品文寄來，我們當選擇有意義的代爲發表。如你想從事學識上的探討，可參加本報流通圖書館及讀書指導部。詳細手續請直接函詢該館可也。啓事　　本欄創立宗旨原以個别答覆爲主；或遇有公開討論之價値者，則擇予發表。乃少數讀者不明此旨，不管問題性質，紛請公開答覆，且多不附地址，卽姓名想亦不實。本欄對於此種來信，無論如何重要，均屬欲覆無從。查讀者不願將其眞名實地告知之原因，大槪恐有洩其秘密，妨礙前途之虞。殊不知本欄對於一切函件内容，莫不嚴負保守秘密之責任。如有不願宣佈眞名者，則可預囑另用他名發表，不必有所顧慮。希讀者了解此點，以後來信務將詳細地址寫明，否則恕不作答。自我職業介紹　　某君，年二十二歲，江陰人，高中程度，茲願在各報館各通訊社任翻譯新聞電報工作，待遇三十元，欲聘者請函北京路中法藥房許亞森君轉。　　某君，年三十歲，寗波籍，舊制中學畢業，曾任小學敎員及報館記者，茲仍願担任上項職務，各機關如欲聘者請函新疆路二三七號樓上張靄章收。　　某君，年二十二歲，寗波籍，初中程度，向在本埠各游藝塲充當茶房，爲人幹練機警，熟悉本埠路徑，茲仍願充茶房或公役等職務，各界如欲僱用者，請函新疆路二三七號樓上張阿章收。　　某女士，江蘇人，年二十六，高中程度，曾任小學敎師及在本埠某大文化機關服務，茲願担任家庭敎師或銀行洋行職員，如有需用上項人員者，請函四川路十一號三樓四社聯合辦事處黄覺民君轉。小説舞會（三）  匈牙利Ｍ·周凱作　士衡譯　　同時我們的兩位客還没有來得及睡下，一個使官到來了，他要和他們講話。　　「現在你不能見他們，」我回答。「他們全都睡了；但是你可以等着，或是再來一次。」　　「他們睡在那里？」他問。　　我把那房間指給他，他一點也不想一想他是否應當招醒他們｜兩天没有睡覺的人，於是就面孔冷冷地走進屋裏去。我希望他們立刻把這個打擾他們的人切成碎片，可是事實上在幾分鐘之後，他們全都穿得很整齊地出現了，一點都不露出不歡喜的樣子跟隨着那個使官，少佐派人來找他們的。　　這種軍隊生活是多麽奇怪的事呀！怎麽人們會一點不反抗地服從着呢！眞的，我一定會成爲一個極壞的士兵，因爲我總是要預先曉得爲什麽要命令我作一件事。　　約有半個鐘頭，那兩個軍官又回來了｜看不出他們是有什麽不快或疲倦；他們甚至不回到他們的房裏去，只是請求着我和媽媽，很殷勤地報告我們，軍部準備在夜裏開一次跳舞會，而且請求我們去，其次他們立刻請求和我約定跳一次法蘭西舞，扎達舞，波蘭舞（其中是没有瓦爾慈舞的）當然我一切都答應了。　　自從狂歡節，這是我們第一次的舞會，他們好像是感到和我們同樣的歡喜，因爲他們再也不肯睡覺了。　　無論如何，媽媽是想出一切的作難和反對的。　　「你没有跳舞的衣服。」　　「我的白色的衣服，親愛的媽媽，我還只穿過一次呢。」　　「那是老式的了。」　　「加上一條國色的絲帶，那就可以成爲時髦之中的最美麗的了，」那個黑色軍官挿嘴説。　　「但是我的脚痛，」媽媽固執着。　　「不是絶對必要你跳舞的，親愛的媽媽。」　　兩個軍官没有大笑起來｜只爲禮貎的關係，而因爲同樣的理由，在他們没有離開之前媽媽也没有責駡我。　　「你傻孩子，」她憤怒地説，「在危險之前你還胡來，有意地毁壞了你自己。」　　我以爲媽媽是怕我傷風了，因爲每當我預備去跳舞她總是這樣的，而且爲使她不要害怕，我提醒她舞會裏是没有瓦爾慈舞的。這更使她憤怒了。　　　　「你缺欠意識，」她呌着，「你以爲他們開這次會是爲了跳舞麽？絶對不是的。這是一種計策｜是軍部要把全鎭的女兒們集在一起的一種隂謀，到那時他們可以捉到她們把她們運到土耳其去了。　　「啊，媽媽，軍官在戰爭的時候是不准結婚的。」我大聲笑着和她説。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　建築專刊無聲室的建築法  壽　　阻止外界嘈雜音浪傳入的密室，在近代生活裏，日漸成為重要的東西了，無聲室在無綫電廣播事業和有聲電影的攝製上，早已是不可少的要素，其他如重要的公事房，機要室等，對於這一點的要求，也在一天天的增加。　　現代工程學家已經採用特殊的方法，利用甘蔗製糖以後的廢棄糟渣，達到這個目的，他們建築四吋厚的磚牆，牆中用榨取了糖質後的甘蔗作絶聲物，牆的兩面塗以硬性的光滑的士敏土，以便反射聲浪，門是用兩層鋼片做成的，中間隔着一道空氣層，室的底面立在木塊上，被三四層絶聲物隔絶，絶聲物多用膠質膠緊，少用釘頭，因為釘頭也是傳音浪的媒介物，至於該室流通空氣的方法，着實費了不少的研究，後來終用了耳輪形的小管，依照同樣原理去建築，才解决了這個問問題。工廠建築與安全  阿壽　　（節譯美國建築工程專刋）　　誠然，在我國工業不發達，市塲不擴大，政治不健全，科學太落後的當兒，欲求工廠屋舍，精善盡美，事事力求完臻，恐因所費成本過重，獲利極微，爲廠主着想，此點實不易努力推行，是以每見各大工廠，對於資本雄厚與否，機器精美與否，製品銷路如何，市塲需要程度如何，應否採用上乘原料，雇用熟練工人等等問題，莫不詳細考慮再三討論以冀十全十美，絲毫無訾，庶幾營利贏利各方面均能顧及，惟獨於工廠房屋宿間，則往往因陋就簡，隨意設置分配，一廠一屋，旣不先於建築設計之前，盡量計劃，應如何措施，乃事後於全廠各部分各區股中間之佈置，更不注意，其於求業務上製造上之聯絡與呼應豈可得耶？此點，殆爲我國今日工業界，所常犯之普遍症候，最近太乙麥精廠失事之最重要原因，詳細斟察，亦無非因當初忽略其廠屋之地點，與機器之裝置，致釀巨禍，竊以爲我國工業尙在幼年，正宜培養，使之發揚光大，倘因區區細點，偶一疏忽，而罹不幸，以衰弱之軀的工業界，更何堪此種如風暴雨之摧殘！爰節錄數語，詳述廠屋製造之重要性，與安全問題之相互關係：　　考工廠房屋之功效，端在普通方面：係保護貴重機件，出品，及原料，並促進工匠增加工作效率，其在特殊額外方面者：係有各種轉運，起重等機之裝置，有防火，防水，取暖，隔絶，採光等設備，一則增進工作能率，再則護衛廠舍，負有安全責任，是以廠屋，與廠中精美機器，良好原料，熟練工匠，同共負求得製造上，營業上，最高經濟效能之使命，故廠屋之設計及建築，興全廠之佈置設施，聯絡呼應，脈絡一貫，成正比例，卽廠屋設計佳劣，建築良莠，與佈置設施是否成一貫，直接影響到工業製造之效率，故從事於工業上製造者，對於工廠廠屋之重要性，切切不可疏忽，致有眼光短縮之譏，和貪小利失大本之弊。　　倘使，今有精美機件，貴重原料，貯藏於破敗簡陋之廠屋中，製造之，經營之，設或發生不測事故，如火患，水患，風災，地震，盜刦等等，天災人禍，因設備欠缺，措施少有計劃，以致遭遇重大損失，旣或徼倖保有常年險，以年付巨大數額之保險費，何若早先計入預算表内，將此筆保險費，以年數迭加之總數，以之建築設備安全，堅固，耐用之廠屋？何况保險之後，萬一肇事，往往保險公司因責任問題，藉胡推諉不償，即使充分賠償，然因出事之後，全部事業停頓，種種無形中之損失，斷非區區保險賠償費，所能彌補於萬一也，　　猶有廠屋或甚堅固耐用，然於安全設計，不甚精確注意，每每建築上，不聯絡呼應，使各部機件，失却照顧，謬誤層出，致使他部工匠，受到影響，不能充分合作，夫去其最高之效率，消毫原料，增加工作時間，多費成本，减少贏利，出品遞减，市塲冷落，因事前於建築上未嘗細愼考虚研究，然廠屋已成，頓感事事不如意，製造不靈敏，動作欠迅速，再需一番精神，一筆血本，從新改造，豈非大大損失？　　或有事前於建築廠屋時，一切均極注意，唯於廠内細瑣地方，有數處遺誤，亦能蒙得意外巨額損失，如因事業創始，未曾經過詳細斟察考究，毫無佈置，以致全廠内之各軀幹，不能周轉，無法聯絡，呼應不靈，運轉費事；或因通風，避風，取暖，宜濕，採光，近火，隔絶等小問題，分配不均，以致全廠内存儲原料，裝置機件，運用人才，感得困難，危害貨品及原料：或因始創時，抱負過大，購地闢廠太廣，實則無須如此張揚，以致難有成功；或因起初過於謹愼，缺乏遠大眼光，購地太仄，廠屋不敷應用，以致各部分不能擴充，事業因之無從發展；就以上種種雜因，可知廠屋與製造，與安全，有密切關係，是以一廠一屋之設計，必須經過研究製造者之方法，性質，及一切關係方面瑣細問題，手續之後，方能開始建築廠屋，良以工廠之設計，及建築，均和普通街市鄕村建築物之設計，與建築，截然不同，大有區别也。　　現今利賴科學萬能，管理學術精進，人材倍出，一切均有詳細學術討論，有精密計劃佈置，有管理方針應付，倘能我國工業界，不自固步自封，明瞭廠屋與製造上之重要性，廠屋與業務上安全之萬能性，事事經過考慮，徵詢此項專門人村，顧問事務上之進行方策，必能使事業猛進，騰黄飛達，一日千里也。吾於我工業界有厚望焉。新村運動聲中談新村建築的設計  影　　在上海，最近新村運動，也可説是很熱鬧呢，江灣，虹橋，滬東，滬西，一簇簇的新村，先後的成功了，然而這些新村的建築，究竟要合於那幾個條件，這當然也是一個値得研究的問題。　　（一）建築新村的條件　　上海，一般的建築師，在企圖之中，都想把房屋的標準提高，使得所謂新村建成而後，能够在美麗中寓有一種莊嚴的神色，把各個建築師的設計，把歷來建築上的優點，集中在一起，務使所建成的房屋，能够適於房客的需要，同時更顧到房客的經濟力量，是否能够及到，有的人喜歡住宅是莊麗而宏大，有的歡喜祇要合用，有的建築，比其他的建築多耗了好多錢，一切的一切，要使一座新村，面面顧到，莊麗宏大而適合起居，更顧到房客的經濟能力，的確，是一件容的事情呢。　　（二）日光和通氣問題　　在新村之中，每所的住宅，通氣的適度，也應極度的利用，建築的經濟，房室的佈置，應顧到可使有日光充分的射入，在遠東各地，所有的房屋，祇知使南面有極度的通風，使夏天有充分的凉風吹進居室，這便是一個極大的錯誤，好多的房屋，南面建有好多的巨大窗門，但忘却了北面，也應有同樣的窗門，使通氣的調和，南窗透進的空氣，假如北面没有出路，但不會有充足的新空氣到達戸内，爲了一間新屋之中，空氣和日光的需要，房屋的建築，的確非得要調和而一致，不可在普通的房屋之中，很怱促的建築起來，我們在裏面年數住得多了，便會發現種種的不適，因此，一般適於現代的建築家，時常會告訴住屋的人，怎樣的房屋，是最適用而合於人們的起居，建築家的確並不是屋内的陳設專家，但他們的工作，却要和内部的陳設能調和，因此，他們在建屋的時候，要想到室内家俱的佈置，窗口的開啟，是否有窒碍，更需知道東方的器物，和地毯的形式，更須使所有電燈，電鈴的關鍵，設置在最適當的地方，事前如果能够面面顧到，一定可增加房屋的美觀，所以在打樣的時候，非得要在紙上悉心的規劃不可。中國的佛敎建築（續）  周和康　　該認爲確是遼金之遺物的，是山西應州佛宮寺的八角五重塔，是遼的淸寗二年之作，其形略似杭州的六和塔，此外古的有開源的白塔，近的有遼陽廣裕寺的塔，更有加入新趣味的北平天寗寺的塔，及八里廟慈壽寺的塔等，這些塔都有明朝以下，屢屢被修過的形跡；遼金之塔，大都是多角的多層塔，特别是在遼的領土内，有着很多的存在，因之在今河北省的北部及東三省的南半部，遼金塔是很常可見到的。　　在五代亦有珍奇的遺物，如南唐的棲霞塔，吳越的西湖雷峯塔及寳叔塔等，雷峯塔今已崩倒，聞杭州人士，爲成全十景起來，有重建的擬願。此外南漢的遺物，有在廣東城内的光孝寺之鐵塔，大理國的遺物，有在雲南省城的東西兩寺的塔，都是名古之物。　　屬於宋朝的，在北方有河北省定州的開元寺的塔，形式很特别，似乎是從中國塔與印度塔，混合而變化出來的，很是精緻，在中部有蘇州瑞光寺之塔，杭州靈隠寺的小石塔等，都是確實的例子。　　元朝的遺物，可想出其必有異樣的東西，其實例有，河北正定的花塔，（亦有傳説爲唐的遺物者），順德的天寗寺之塔，曲陽的塔，又普陀山的太子塔，廣東光孝寺的小塔，這些都是很明顯的元代物。　　明朝的建築物，很多美者，但現巳多歸湮滅了！南京的磁塔，可謂第一的名建築，還有那南門外的大報恩寺的人角九重塔，全部裝以釉瓦，高度爲百米突，可惜均爲長毛亂時所毁，此外有在開封的鐵塔（洪武二十九年），亦八角十三層，高稱三十六丈，全部蔽着釉瓦，又有珍貴的北平北效的五塔寺之塔，（成化十一年），謂係印度僧作佛陀伽耶大塔，故在西郊的碧雲寺，亦有五塔駢玄者，此種塔所占面積浩大下作台形，上立五塔，壯觀非常。　　淸朝的塔，有嗽嘛敎之形，如在北平北海公園的白塔等，中國原無此種式樣，關於其實例，在東西寺及西山的諸名勝，都有存在，往往規模宏大與華麗。　　以上所例是佛敎主要建築物，佛寺，石窟，佛塔，三方面的序述，此外關於獨立的佛像雕刻物，香鼎，壇，及其他佛敎用之小建築物，亦有很多的遺跡，於各地，由此可見中國古代佛敎的盛行，及其建築物的　一斑了！居住之衛生（續）  郭人驥　　（十）（一）換氣之方法　　室内必圖空氣交換。否則空氣中之酸素逐漸减少。而由呼氣火爐燈火所發生之炭酸或其他之有害瓦斯以致污濁。甚至有害吾人之健康者也。　　自然換氣　室中之壁。天花板。地板。屋頂等。稍通空氣。故空氣能透漸經營自然交換。蓋因室内外溫度相差而起之風。故也。内外溫度之差强。或風强者，空氣交換益良。此等由於自然。然僅恃此。在大多數之塲合。頗感不足。　　人工換氣　展開窗戸。容易達到換氣之目的。其在寒季。不能謂爲至善之方法。良以嘗與溫暖空氣接觸者。猝遇寒風。有易罹感胃故也。欲豫防之。宜於窗之上方。另開一孔。或開楣間之小窗。其在洋式房屋。天花板旁。設置氣窗。以便室内空氣流出。苟如此。新鮮空氣通過板壁等之細孔。徐徐侵入。因其間混有幾分溫暖空氣之故。不起寒冷之感覺。若無斯種之設備。不得巳。開窗以圖换氣之時。必須達到必要以上而止。若開放過久。不但無室内換氣之效果。而有格外喪失室内溫度之虞。又外界之氣溫低。則比較的短時間内已足換氣矣。　　（十）（二）家庭中之特殊部分　　廚房　家庭中必須特别注意之處。有三。卽廚房。浴室。及厠所是也。廚房中尤須注意於淸潔。充分明亮。且地位須廣。便於操作。不可使污物堆積。而起腐敗。蒸氣薰烟以及其他藉烟囱等。而傳導於外方。且使換氣佳良。注意板壁等。母使潮濕。水流之處或其附近之壁。須以不鼠透水之材料造成之。且廚房不可接近厠所及垃圾堆。免致發生臭氣。必須豫防蠅之飛集。　　浴室　浴室要以當日爲良。又易於乾燥者亦佳。浴室宜明。且易於換氣。然须注意。勿令隙風侵入。其由燃料而出之瓦斯。卽使無烟。亦宜恃烟囱以傳導於外方。浴宜之壁及地板。必須不透水爲要。　　啟事　　沈一吾，龢蓀，夢白，郭人驥，劉厚羣，周和康，洋洋，穆因，伍成，祺，阿壽，諸君鑒，八月份稿費巳結算，請於本月七日至十日十六日至二十日，每日下午二時至四時（星期日除外）憑章向本館會計處領取爲荷。　　申報建築專刋部啟</p>

<h3 id="e1">Yin Tong and Chai Shan Discuss War Zone Issues at the Japanese Embassy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tao Shangming Heads to Beiping from Tangshan</p>
<p>Huang Fu Cables Beiping, Says He Can Arrive in Beiping in Ten Days</p>
<p>Beiping, Today morning, Chai Shan invited Yin Tong to the Japanese embassy to discuss the war zone issue. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin, Yin Rugeng talked about various issues in the war zone, stating that they must be resolved one by one after Chairman Huang returns. Rumors that he, Yin Tong, and Tao Shangming will be holding a meeting in Beiping, with Chai Shan designated as the Japanese representative, are overblown. He confirmed his intention to discuss matters with Yin Tong and Tao Shangming, but Tao has not yet arrived in Beiping, so they have not yet met. What they want to discuss is that Commissioner Yin Tong has not been seen for many days, and there is a need to exchange opinions on everyone's contacts. Therefore, there was a meeting before Chairman Huang's return north. The banditry of plainclothes teams in Yutian was indeed scattered by the security team's assistance to County Magistrate Chen Baosheng. Although they fled to the border between Zunhua and Xinglong, there should be no further disturbances. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Yin Tong spoke of the war zone issues, and said that Commissioners Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming will arrive in Beiping within days to exchange opinions first. After deciding on specific steps, they will conduct formal negotiations with Chai Shan, the representative of the Kwantung Army. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin, Yin Rugeng returned to Beiping this morning. Regarding the methods to prevent bandits in the Ji-Mi area, he has clearly sought instructions from Yu Xuezhong. Tao Shangming set off from Tangshan for Beiping today. (3rd Dispatch) Nanjing, diplomatic circles reported that Huang Fu still needs to visit Chairman Jiang in Lushan and meet with Ambassador Yan. Originally scheduled to descend the mountain on the 3rd, it has now been changed to the 6th to go to Nanjing and then to Beiping. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, a certain important person stated that Huang Fu had sent a telegram to Beiping, stating that he would leave Lushan on the afternoon of the 3rd or the noon of the 4th, transfer to a steamer eastward, enter Nanjing to meet Wang, and could arrive in Beiping around the 10th of this month. Rumors of an extension of his return north are inaccurate. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Lieutenant Colonel Sakai of the Japanese Army stationed in Shanghai arrived in Beiping from Tianjin tonight. Chai Shan personally welcomed him at the station and is scheduled to tour the famous sights of Beiping tomorrow. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Yin Tong accepted Chai Shan's invitation to the Japanese embassy on the afternoon of the 3rd to discuss preliminary opinions on the war zone issue. It is said that Tao Shangming will arrive in Beiping soon, and work can begin within days. (3rd Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Absurd Remarks Published by a Japanese Embassy Military Official <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Responsible Persons of That Country Should Take Action to Stop Them</p>
<p>Beiping, Tianjin, the "Beijing-Tianjin Daily News" of August 31 published a speech by Lieutenant Colonel Kagesa, Assistant to the Military Attache of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, entitled "Huang Fu, Who Has No Strength, His Return North Is Meaningless." The content criticized Mr. Huang's negotiations with Japan as insincere and contained various provocative words. According to Yin Tong's opinion on this matter, Lieutenant Colonel Kagesa is a newly appointed assistant to the military attache of the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai and receives the same courtesy as our country's diplomats. He is not a person without responsibility or status and should not have made such a gaffe. Anyone who understands international etiquette should know this. Regardless of whether the reported news is true or false, the responsible personnel of that country must take action to stop or pay attention to it. (3rd Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Beiping, Song Zheyuan and Qin Xingchun met with He Yingqin this morning to report on the military and political situation in Chahar Province and discuss the reorganization of Yang Hou's small contingent. Song will go to Tianjin within a day or two to visit relatives and is scheduled to stay for five or six days before returning to Beiping to report everything to the central government. It is said that Huang has decided to pass through Nanjing around the 5th on his way back north. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun Spreads Rumors and Provokes Animosity <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun of Japan reported on August 8 that He Yingqin had established a secret Beiping office in Jurentang, appointing many Japanese and Korean people to go to Shenyang, Harbin, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe to secretly investigate the current situation of Japan and Manchuria against Russia and whether the Japanese army intends to invade North China. On the same day, the newspaper also reported that He Yingqin was summoned by Chairman Jiang and scheduled to go south in early September, and telegraphed Song Zheyuan, Wang Yitang, Qin Dechun, etc. to go there. After they arrived, Huang Fu and other central figures would be invited to make a final decision on the North China issue. It seems that the term of Huang's return will also be decided accordingly. However, according to related sources, there is no such thing and it is thought to be the rumors of traitors intended to provoke animosity between China and Japan. The newspaper's report is completely inaccurate. (3rd Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Huang Musong Arrives in Lhasa, Tibetans Give Him a Warm Welcome <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, Chu Minyi told reporters on the 3rd that Huang Musong arrived safely in Lhasa on the 26th of last month. Two monk and lay Kahlons led senior officials to welcome him outside the city, blocking the road. The enthusiastic situation was unprecedented. After arriving at the residence, the four Kahlons went to pay their respects and inquired about the well-being of Lin, Wang, and Jiang, which shows Tibet's enthusiasm for the central government.

<h3 id="e6">Communist Elements Discovered in the Material Factory of the Beining Railway <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin, Tangshan, several communist elements were discovered among the workers in the village material factory of the Beining Railway Bureau. On the 2nd, the factory director noticed, reported to the railway bureau for instructions, and tightened the gate control. The railway police searched the factory. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin, since Zhao Dazhong fled, his henchmen are still scattered in the Kailuan mines, engaging in agitation. Because the authorities' prevention is very strict, no accidents have occurred. Recently, they have once again become active and sneaked into the Beining Road Manufacturing Plant to engage in agitation and distribute leaflets. In addition to sending personnel to persuade workers not to be exploited, the road authorities have issued orders to strictly prevent it, and gate control has been especially tightened.

<h3 id="e7">More Than 100 Japanese Troops Openly Stationed in Malanyu <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>A Large Amount of Opium Transported to Beiping from Rehe</p>
<p>The Xinglong Militia Interferes</p>
<p>A Squad Leader Is Run Over by the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Tianjin, on the 1st, a team of about 120 Japanese soldiers, carrying eight machine guns and more than ten carts of supplies, arrived near the Qing Tombs in Malanyu from Chengde, Rehe, and were stationed there. The Japanese infantry company originally stationed there will leave for Jinxi on the 5th. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin, the team of the 1st Company of the 3rd Regiment of the Security Forces in our war zone, dispatched to Malanyu to protect the Qing tombs, was previously rejected from entering by the Japanese garrison. After Yin Rugeng negotiated with Chai Shan in Beiping and obtained the Japanese side's consent, they entered outside the east gate of Malanyu on the 31st of last month and temporarily stationed in Cuijia Store. The Japanese side has not yet allowed the team to take over the tomb guarding duties. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin, on the 1st, a small team of troops from a certain country protected several military vehicles and transported 50 bundles of opium, about 1,250 packages, totaling 300,000 taels, from Rehe to Pingjin. When passing through Xinglong, they encountered the militia who wanted to detain them. The Japanese army ran over a militia squad leader, sent him to a certain country's gendarmerie team in Malanyu for detention, and refused to release him. It is said that a certain country's army charges one dime per tael for opium transportation. The Pseudo-Rehe Opium Monopoly Bureau has established branches in the Great Wall, Lengkou, Yiyuan Kou, and Malanyu to tax the opium imported into our territory at 18 cents per tael. In the past week, a large amount has been transported into the country. In addition to a large amount being sold to Tangshan, all is transported to Pingjin. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Kong Xiangxi Returns to Nanjing to Discuss Bandit Suppression and the Economy <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Suppression of Bandits Can Be Concluded This Year</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Does Not Prohibit the Export of Silver</p>
<p>Hoping That the People Will Pay Attention to Production and Reduce Consumption</p>
<p>Nanjing, Kong Xiangxi, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Soong Ai-ling, took a car down the mountain from Guling at 9:00 AM on the 2nd and boarded the Wenxing warship to Nanjing at 10:30 AM on the 3rd. Li Tang, He Yimin, and other important officials of the Ministry of Finance all came to the wharf to welcome them. After Kong disembarked, he went straight back to the Mausoleum Private Residence to rest. In the afternoon, he will visit President Wang and go to the Ministry of Finance to handle official business. (3rd Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Kong Xiangxi briefly discussed the silver issue with people today, saying that because the gold prices in Britain and the United States had fallen before, the silver price had risen slightly. Speculators transported silver to England to profit. In order to stabilize the silver price, he had made a statement in Lushan. The government should protect the cash needed for international trade and said that there was no need to impose a silver export tax. Now that the British gold price has rebounded and the silver price has also fallen slightly, there has been no large-scale export of silver since this week. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Kong Xiangxi told reporters from the Central News Agency on the 3rd that Chairman Jiang had been slightly unwell due to the complexity of the conference affairs, but he has now fully recovered his health. The situation in the bandit suppression in Jiangxi Province is very good and can be concluded within the year. War is the most cruel act of mankind. The government is determined to consolidate the foundation of the country and put down the red bandits, but all the steps taken are based on benevolence. In the dual approach of military and political forces, we are unwilling to take extremely cruel measures to bombard the bandit nests with heavy weapons. The current bandit suppression work is progressing step by step, seeking to defeat the main force of the bandits and rushing to do post-disaster work in the newly recovered bandit areas to bring peace to the people. China has suffered from natural disasters and man-made disasters in recent years, coupled with the global economic downturn, resulting in the impoverishment of the people. In the future, I hope that the people of the whole country will understand economic principles, pay attention to production, reduce consumption, work diligently and frugally, and increase the national economic strength. When the people are rich, the country will naturally be strong. China currently has an annual trade deficit of about 800 million yuan. If everyone increases production by two yuan per year, it can make up for the leakage, which is easy to do. The current central finance is in good condition, but smuggling and tax evasion incidents occur frequently. This department will try to remedy it. After the United States announced the nationalization of silver, people in Shanghai were panicked and exported a large amount of silver because they were afraid that this department would increase the silver export tax or prohibit the export of silver. In fact, this department has not done this. Finally, the reporter asked Kong whether he would go to the southwest provinces to inspect the people's conditions and finances. Kong replied that he was tied up with departmental affairs, and after handling them separately, he might go to various places. (3rd Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi talked freely for an hour and discussed financial and other issues. (3rd Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Nanjing, President Wang visited Finance Minister Kong at 6:00 PM on the 3rd and discussed financial issues for about an hour. At 8:00 PM, Kong met with reporters and talked about the silver issue. Currently, there is no outflow from the country, so this issue has come to an end. Chairman Jiang's bandit suppression is progressing very rapidly. The Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau can be established within a month. When I go to Shanghai, I can decide on the date of establishment. (3rd Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Ju Zheng...Listen to Fate and Do One's Best</p>
<p>Nanjing, The Central Government held its 146th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 3rd. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Fu Rulin, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Ce, Li Ciwen, and all working comrades, a total of more than 500 people, attended. Chairman Ye Chucang led the ceremony. Fu Rulin reported on the issue of unifying the national water conservancy, saying that water conservancy is one of China's major issues and urgently needs to be resolved. Water conservancy is not only about flood control and irrigation. All artificial operations that cause water to be effective are water conservancy. In the past, China only paid attention to a part of flood control and irrigation and did not take into account how to use water to generate other functions. The main reason for the drought in our country in the past was the lack of water storage facilities. To avoid disasters, it is necessary to statistically analyze the annual rainfall and the water volume of each river and the amount of water needed for farmland irrigation across the country in advance, and store them according to the amount of need to prevent drought. As for the Yangtze River and Yellow River, the two major rivers in our country, the riverbeds used to be more stable and there were fewer disasters. Now the river basins on both sides of the Yangtze River are also silted up, and there is no place to store water, so there are floods when there is a lot of rain and droughts when there is no rain. The same is true for the Yellow River downstream of Mengjin. Therefore, to manage the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, we should first open canals and dredge lakes to find ways to store water. In addition, the Huai River and Yongding River have been reorganized by water conservancy personnel using scientific methods in recent years and have been effective. Other water conservancy agencies are only engaged in dredging. Although the Yangtze River flows very smoothly, Nantong and other areas are low-lying and often collapse. According to expert speculation, there is a possibility of changing course. The central government's annual water management expenses are about 20 million yuan, and there are local water management agencies and expenses of about 1 million yuan each year. Most of these 3 million yuan of water management funds are consumed by institutional administration, so the results are very small. To achieve the actual effect of water management, it is necessary to unify water conservancy administration, concentrate funds and talents, and hope that the central government will promptly announce the Water Conservancy Law. Now the central government is paying close attention to this matter and is being fully handled by the Economic Committee. I think it should not be messy in the future.

<p>Nanjing, The National Government held its Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 3rd. Wang Zhaoming, Ju Zheng, Chu Minyi, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Gongbo, Cao Haosen, Wang Yongbin, Chen Qicai, Lin Xiang, Chen Xunyong, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from various courts, departments, and committees, a total of more than 300 people, attended. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting and made a report entitled (Listening to Fate and Doing One's Best), saying that this year's floods and droughts in various places are quite serious, and the autumn harvest of agriculture has been greatly reduced. The central and local governments are now preparing to formulate specific measures to rush to rescue and provide disaster relief. On the other hand, we can draw a conclusion from this disaster, that is, even in advanced countries, there are disasters, but they can use science to manipulate nature, and the disasters they suffer are not as serious as those in our country, and the disaster areas are not as wide as those in our country. When our country encounters a disaster, we should not simply blame it on natural disasters. It is really caused by not doing our best. Now, we must deal with the current relief and disaster relief, but we must intensify the basic work of preventing floods and droughts, such as afforestation and dredging rivers, to prevent the recurrence of natural disasters next year. I hope that the whole country will be determined to not ask about fate but do its best. No matter how difficult it is, we must do it in practice.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Chairman Lin Returns to Nanjing <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Ships Hang the Chinese Flag to Show Respect</p>
<p>The Hai Rong Warship Fired 21 Gun Salutes</p>
<p>Nanjing, Chairman Lin left Xun on the Zhongshan warship at 10:00 AM on the 2nd, accompanied by Chief of Staff Lu Chao, and arrived in Nanjing at 7:00 AM on the 3rd. The National Government received the news in advance and notified the police department and the garrison to strictly guard the area from the riverbank in Xiaguan to the naval wharf. The National Government sent many guards and a military band to the wharf to wait in formation. At the same time, the Ministry of the Navy received a telegram from the Zhongshan warship, informing them of the time of arrival and dispatched a military band and a row of naval guards to welcome them at the pontoon ship. When the Zhongshan warship sailed to the river surface in Xiaguan, traffic was cut off in the area along the river, and the atmosphere was solemn. At around 7:00 AM, those who came to the wharf to welcome him included Wei Huai, Chen Qicai, Yang Rumei, Chu Minyi, and senior officials of the government, as well as Gu Zhenglun, Chen Zhuo, Chen Shaokuan, and others, about 100 people. Chen Shaokuan also boarded the ship by small boat to greet him. The flag of the Chairman of the National Government was hung high on the Zhongshan warship. When it was about to arrive at the port, the Hai Rong warship anchored in the center of the river immediately raised the flag and fired a 21-gun salute to pay respect. All the foreign ships stationed in Nanjing also hung the Chinese flag to show their respect. The Zhongshan warship did not dock at the naval pontoon until 7:15 AM. All the welcomers boarded the ship one after another to the living room to pay their respects to the chairman. Chairman Lin was wearing a robe, a grey gauze shirt and a gauze vest, and holding a cane. He was very energetic and nodded to each member in reply and inquired briefly. After a short rest, he went ashore. At that time, the captain of the Zhongshan warship led a team of soldiers in formation on the deck to salute the chairman, while the military band of the National Government's Ministry of the Navy lined up on the springboard and played military music. The chairman then changed to the National Government's No. 661 car and entered the city. All the welcomers also took cars and followed the chairman into the city, then went straight to the official residence to rest. The chairman told the Central News Agency reporter on the warship that he had been out of Nanjing for more than two months. Now he has returned to Nanjing to preside over government affairs, and he has scheduled a meeting with the Belgian special envoy who will come to Nanjing to thank him. He will not leave Nanjing again recently. He had a good rest in Lushan, and his health is good. Everything in Jiangxi Province is progressing and the bandit suppression is also in good condition. It can be cleared soon. Chairman Jiang often met with me in the mountains, and Huang Fu, Yan Huiqing, and Gu Weijun all visited me in Lushan and reported in detail on the international situation. The Fifth Plenary Congress is approaching, and I have not yet planned to make any proposals. (3rd Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Gu Mengyu Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Talks About the Inspection Trip to the North</p>
<p>Whether to Go to Lushan Is Undecided</p>
<p>Nanjing, Gu Mengyu arrived in Nanjing at 8:00 AM on the 3rd, accompanied by his wife, son, and secretaries Chen Zheng, Gu Xiwu, on the express train No. 305 from Pinghu. Those who welcomed him at the station included Gu Zhengding, Director of the Department of Railways, Yu Zhaochun, Section Chief, Yin Juncai, and more than 20 senior officials. According to Gu, 1) The inspection of the railways in the north was good, especially the Ping Sui Railway, which performed better. However, the railway was flooded this time, and the bridge was washed away. It is planned to change the route to ensure safety, but the funding is difficult. Now there is only this plan. 2) The Ping Han Railway is now planning to be actively reorganized, but there are many methods, and it is not necessary to borrow money. 3) After returning to Nanjing, I plan to first tour the Long Hai Railway in the short term, and then continue to inspect various railways. 4) Whether to go to Lushan is undecided. 5) The Yue Han Railway is scheduled to be completed in the year after next, and is now actively underway. As for the location of the railway bureau, it has not yet been determined. It will be set up in a more convenient place in the future. 6) I have no proposal for the Fifth Plenary Congress. (3rd Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Gu Mengyu said that he had met with the directors of the Ping Han Railway and Bei Ning Railway in Beiping to discuss the reform of the railway. The reorganization of the Ping Han Railway is the most urgent, because the railway runs through the north and south, and its relationship is important. It has been in disrepair for many years, and the rails, sleepers, and bridges are old and dilapidated. The Yellow River iron bridge has been washed by water, and the bridge foundation has been loosened, which urgently needs to be repaired. Therefore, there is a debt of 30 million for repairs. Now, because the negotiations are not in harmony, it has been temporarily suspended. We can only start with cutting expenditure. It is estimated that after saving expenses, we can save more than one million yuan a year, which will be used for gradual repairs. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Border Affairs of Kham and Tibet and the Establishment of Xikang Province in the Court <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The National Government has specially appointed Huang Musong as the envoy to pay respects to the Dalai Lama. This time, he is traveling to Tibet through Sichuan and Kham. Estimating his journey, he should be not far from Lhasa. (Some say he has already arrived in Lhasa.) Mr. Huang once said himself: (Tibet is far away on the border, and news from the interior is often cut off. Therefore, my visit is like a radio. I hope that in the future, there will be telecommunication between China and Tibet.) We admire Mr. Huang's journey and sincerely hope that the long-standing issues between China and Tibet can be resolved soon.</p>
<p>In today's issues between China and Tibet, the most critical and beneficial to our country is the disputes in Kham and Tibet. The root cause lies in the border issues. Because the border issues have been unresolved for a long time, Tibetan bandits in the Sichuan border region can frequently invade, posing a significant threat to our western frontier. In the 20th year of the Republic [1931], after the Dabai Incident occurred, our army drove the Tibetan bandits to the west bank of the Jinsha River and concluded the (Gangtuo Agreement). As a result, the land on the east bank of the Jinsha River was restored, and the border situation temporarily achieved some stability. Unexpectedly, on February 8th of this year, the Tibetan side, citing the need to resolve outstanding issues, met with our representatives in Aida. During the meeting, they put forward harsh conditions, not only wanting to abolish the (Gangtuo Agreement) but also wanting to seize Dege, Ganzhan, and the western regions of the Ba'an River. Our side refused to discuss it, and the war on the border reappeared. This shows that the border situation is complex and the future is full of difficulties. It is not easy for Mr. Huang to enter Tibet this time. We earnestly hope that the government will take this good opportunity, based on historical and geographical evidence, instruct Mr. Huang to use it as a basis for negotiation and to negotiate with the Tibetan side. Examining our country's historical records, the inclusion of the Kham people began in the Han Dynasty. Its territory extended from Dajianlu in the east to Dandashan in the west, bordering Weixi and Zhongdian in Yunnan to the south, and beyond Eluo Seda Yefan to the north, bordering Gansu. Even today, the Tibetans living east of Dandashan still call themselves Khampa, while those living west of Dandashan call themselves Tibetan Khampa, which proves that the border between Kham and Tibet lies at Dandashan. Even taking a step back and adopting the opinion of Liu Wenhui, the commander-in-chief of the Sichuan-Kham border defense, the minimum border should be at Changdu.</p>
<p>We are well aware that since the passing of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, the Tibetan authorities have been under the wings of the British. Their ideal border between Kham and Tibet must conform to the British position. The so-called British position was seen in the formal meetings of the second and third years of the Republic [1913-1914]. In the Simla Conference of the second year of the Republic, the British wanted to use Dajianlu as the border between China and Tibet. In the Delhi Conference of the third year of the Republic, they wanted to divide Tibet into two parts, Outer Tibet establishing a separate province, including Tibet and Changdu on the Sichuan border, and setting up an independent government to control its actual power. Although our side has never officially recognized these two proposals, their extravagant desires are already evident. Judging from the progress of the Aida meeting, we are afraid that the attitude of the Tibetan side will not be immediately reconciled in the future. Even if Mr. Huang negotiates, the outcome seems predictable. However, our position must be determined.</p>
<p>Closely related to the border disputes is the issue of establishing Xikang Province. In recent years, although the Tibetan forces have deeply penetrated Kham, the Kham people's feelings toward Tibet are not good. During this year's military period, the Kham people in the various parts of south-central Kham west of the Jinsha River jointly revolted against the Tibetan army. It is said that their purpose was to demand the establishment of Xikang Province. Later, it was heard that when Huang Musong passed through Kangding, the local people also demanded seven things, including clarifying the boundaries to eliminate disputes and increasing funding to establish provincial governance. Mr. Huang reported the situation to the central government, which intends to establish a Xikang Political Affairs Committee as a transitional measure for establishing the province before the funding is properly planned and the border disputes between Kham and Tibet are fully resolved.</p>
<p>Speaking of the establishment of Xikang Province, we recall the measures taken by Zhao Erfeng, the Minister of Border Affairs of Sichuan and Yunnan, after the 32nd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1906). At that time, Mr. Zhao realized the importance of the border area and believed that the establishment of the province could not be delayed. In terms of military affairs, he specially handled the two donations of Sichuan Shantang as military pay. In terms of political affairs, he requested to allocate 1 million taels of treasury silver from the Jianghai and Jianghan customs to engage in (reforming native chieftains under central government control). Military and political affairs complemented each other. Whenever a place was obtained, personnel would be appointed to investigate the population and clear up grain taxes. Various facilities were successively carried out. After seven years of hard work, the province of Xikang began to take shape. For the current plan, resolving border affairs is of utmost importance. Secondly, planning military pay is also a matter of urgency. The military pay for the Sichuan border has always been subsidized by the provincial treasury. However, during the sixth year of the Republic [1917], the Chen government in Sichuan raised the revolutionary banner, and Chen Xialing alone guarded the Sichuan border, siding with the Northern government. Because of this relationship, the provincial funds were cut off. Chen had no intention of preparing for the border, and the humiliating ceasefire conditions of Rongba Cha were established. Now, the poor relationship between the two Lius has reached its extreme. The difficulty of military pay on the Sichuan border is also a fact. It seems that there must be considerable remedy. At the same time, the central government should order the two provinces of Gansu and Qinghai to send troops to assist when necessary, to deter the Tibetan bandits. If military and political affairs can be properly planned, the Tibetan side will not dare to easily invade. Not only can border negotiations increase strength, but the future establishment of Xikang Province will also benefit. The National Government's concern for the Tibetan situation is evident to all. On this day when Mr. Huang is about to arrive in Lhasa, should we not give the entire Kham-Tibet issue another careful consideration?</p>

<p>Train Attacked Again</p>
<p>Harbin, this afternoon, received a telegram from here stating that a train bound for Suifenhe, while traveling seven miles from Hengdaohezi, derailed and damaged several locomotives and passenger cars due to the tracks being destroyed. The guerrillas lurking nearby opened fire and then boarded the train to search it. Anything of value was taken away. Fortunately, no one was injured. Only two Russian railway workers were taken away by the guerrillas. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>

<p>Harbin, the guerrilla squad that hijacked a train and kidnapped nine passengers from Japan and the United States in the southern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, had eight leaders, each with more than ten followers. They had strict military discipline and possessed sophisticated weapons manufactured in Germany and Czechoslovakia. They were indeed a very organized group and had secret intelligence agencies in Harbin, which shows that the last hijacking was a planned action and worthy of attention. The work of kidnapping and demanding ransom this time was all a premeditated act by their leader, Jiang Dong, and about 40 others. They have fully confessed, so the Japanese defense forces executed all the leaders by shooting.</p>

<p>Harbin, Johnsen and Mr. Ruli, employees of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, who were kidnapped on the southbound train on the Chinese Eastern Railway last Thursday night, arrived in Harbin this morning after their escape. Both were dressed as engine oilers and were not injured. However, Mr. Ruli felt uneasy due to shock and exposure. They said that when they were kidnapped, they were all wearing pajamas. The bandits tied their necks and hands with ropes and dragged them like livestock. When the rescue team approached that day, the bandits pressed the backs of the hostages with pistols three times, forcing them to walk in front of the bandit crowd to avoid the rescue team. The bandit crowd held rifles and machine guns. Later, they arrived on an island in the Songhua River, but it was still detected by Japanese aircraft. When Japanese soldiers arrived on the island and landed, the bandits pointed their pistols at the mouths of the hostages, prohibiting them from making a sound. However, a Japanese man named Murakami ignored the threat and shouted loudly to attract the attention of the Japanese soldiers. The bandits shot him. Seeing that the situation was dire, they abandoned the hostages and fled. Then Johnsen released himself and Ruli, went to the waterfront, and met the Japanese soldiers. Murakami, after treatment, has been sent to Harbin by a (Manchurian) gunboat. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>
<p>Harbin, the nine hostages, both Chinese and foreigners, rescued by the Japanese army, arrived in Harbin at 5:17 p.m. on the 2nd aboard the military ship Fuji. Although the incident only happened a few days ago, it felt like a past dream. According to their words to reporters, it was completely unclear where they were taken. In case of emergency, (it seemed that they intended to dispose of us. Because the Japanese army was too close, there was no time to fire at us, nor was there any opportunity to fire.) The bandits hid us in the willows, raised their guns at us, and said, (If you make a sound, you will be beheaded immediately.) We were trembling with fear, thinking that we would have no chance of survival, and could only sit and wait for death. But we were rescued, which was really a great fortune in misfortune. However, we are now extremely exhausted and our memory is incomplete. We plan to recount everything after a period of rest. (Dentsu, 3rd)</p>

<p>Changchun, at 1 p.m. today, a fire suddenly broke out in the building of the (Manchukuo) Palace Affairs Department. Although the fire brigade tried their best to fight the fire, it was still spreading from below. (Dentsu, 3rd)</p>
<p>Changchun, at 1 p.m. today, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen of the dormitory for employees of the (Manchu State) Palace Affairs Department. Because ordinary people are usually prohibited from entering and exiting, there was great chaos at the time. After the efforts of the Japanese (Manchu) army and the fire brigade to put out the fire, fortunately, it did not cause a major disaster. Only a portion of the kitchen was destroyed. At that time, the Japanese Embassy, ​​because the Palace Affairs Department was close to the palace, prepared for the worst so that the puppet emperor could go to the embassy for refuge, but soon it returned to calmness.

<p>Proved that both had Injuries</p>
<p>Boli, a telegram from Harbin, the Japanese Gendarmerie Command recently released two Soviet railway workers of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Grigoriev and Grovina. They were subjected to beastly torture during interrogation. This point can be proved by the medical examination report of Harbin doctors on August 29th. This examination report was signed by Drs. Toro Puvov and Fanizki of the Chinese Eastern Railway Hospital. The report stated that Grigoriev had a lot of bleeding on his right shoulder, with two crisscrossing blood marks, and a lot of bleeding on his left shoulder, with four crisscrossing marks, and it was extremely painful. The left ear was inflamed due to being beaten. Grovina's examination report showed symptoms of extreme nervousness and severe traumatic neurosis. The finger bones were severely cracked, the skin was broken and injured, and there was subcutaneous bleeding. It has now been proven that the injuries of the two were extremely serious.

<p>Conflict Can Be Temporarily Avoided</p>
<p>Dalian, Major General Komatsu, the former chairman of the Japanese Military Affairs Committee in Harbin, arrived here today and plans to go to the Army General Staff in Tokyo for his duties. It is said that the elite of the Soviet Russian Army is now stationed near the border, but they are just barking from afar. Although the Soviet Union is preparing for war, it does not want to take the offensive because if its elite is defeated, the consequences will be unimaginable. The Major General also said that the border residents are not as frightened by the existence of tension as the people far away. The current situation is not as serious as it is rumored. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>
<p>London (Manchester Guardian) commented on the conflict between the puppet Manchukuo and the Soviet Union over the Chinese Eastern Railway in Guandong. It said that although the Moscow government had agreed to cede the Chinese Eastern Railway to the puppet Manchukuo, it could not be regarded as the Soviet Union preparing to cede the Maritime Province of Siberia to Japan. If Japan's seizure of Russian property is not enough, and it still wants to occupy Russian territory, then Japan will soon understand that the Soviet Union will never bargain to such an extent. In short, although the Soviet Union is not very strong, it will never show weakness and will never concede to such demands from Japan. No matter how the Chinese Eastern Railway issue is resolved, the Soviet Union will defend its own territory. This is almost certain. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<p>Moscow Moscow press circles attach great importance to the Japanese (Manchu) newspapers' public propaganda of anti-Soviet war. All newspapers published the essence of the essay signed by Mr. Tamura in the Japanese newspaper (Harbin News) in Harbin. The author strongly advocated an attack on the Soviet Union in the article and incited the Japanese people to oppose the Soviet Union. The article was titled (We Must Love War) and stated, (Nineteen out of ten of our inland people (referring to the Japanese in Manchuria) say that it would be very appropriate if the war could break out at the moment.) The author also said, (If the Soviet Union's beasts threaten the gardens of Manchuria, we must not tolerate it. It is worth supporting the desire to eliminate these beasts as soon as possible and maintain a peaceful situation. We must spread this idea throughout the country, because in hunting these beasts, the whole country must rise up, so this need will not be sufficient if only we Japanese in Harbin realize it.) The newspaper also launched an accelerated fundraising campaign to prepare for war (even elementary school children must save on their school supplies and breakfast). The author added, (Even three-year-old children, when playing war games, must be solemnly taught how to shoot guns and how to slash knives, and at the same time, they must instill this idea, that is, war is a happy act and must be loved.)

<p>This Trip is Declared to Be Completely Private</p>
<p>The Government Implies Support for Investment in Manchuria</p>
<p>London The British Industrial Survey Delegation to (Manchukuo) set off last week. The Soviet Russian government is deeply suspicious and uneasy about it, because the delegation members are quite pro-Japanese. At least two of them have special feelings for Japan. One is Biggot, the representative of the Iron and Steel Association. Mr. Bi grew up in Japan and has a Japanese name, Ito. His father is a well-known Japan expert, and his brother is also a Japan expert in the British War Department. The second is Rocock, a director of the British Industry Association. His uncle served in the British Embassy in Japan in 1863. Even the chairman of the delegation, Sir Barr P., has huge investments in the Far East. The government here has stated that the transfer is completely private, but at the same time, it also explained that the British government will do its best to support the increase in trade between Britain and Manchuria. The Associated Press inquired of those familiar with the situation whether British loans to Manchuria conflicted with Britain's policy of non-recognition. Their answer was also vague. They thought that such loans could be considered completely non-political, but based on this answer, the British government actually intends to approve future loans to (Manchukuo). It is not yet known whether the delegation will discuss debt issues. The delegation members have no indication, but since there is a banking leader, Sere Men, in the delegation, the issue of loans is inevitable. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>Geological Survey by the Russian Geographical Society</p>
<p>Tass, Moscow, July 29th</p>
<p>At the International Geographical Congress held in Hanlan, the report of the Soviet representative on the 1933 survey of the central Tianshan Mountains by Ukrainian scientists and explorers was very important. The Tianshan Mountains are located in the center of the Asian continent, on the border between the Soviet Union and Xinjiang, with Lake Balkhash to the north. However, due to the difficulty of the road, the outside world knows very little about its details. What was known before was only based on the report of the Russian explorer Semenov around 1856. In 1933, the Soviet expedition team went to survey, led by Professor Landu of the Ukrainian Geographical Institute. The entire team was divided into seven groups and set off in different directions. They discovered 25 glaciers and several mountain peaks, including the Red Army Peak and the Barezki Peak, which are about 20,000 feet high. At the same time, a geological survey was conducted, proving that the mountains contain gold, iron, copper, lead, and other minerals. Minerals such as oil and coal also seem to exist. The foothills and slopes are suitable for animal husbandry, and agriculture is also very suitable.</p>

<p>Tokyo, the Washington Treaty, which threatens Japan's national defense, if Japan decisively announces its abandonment, then the United States will build aircraft bases in Alaska and the Riuxiya and other places, according to the declarations of Secretary of the Navy Swanson and others. This is enough to threaten the sense of security of Japan's national defense. The Japanese Navy, in order to seek appropriate countermeasures to deal with this situation, has ordered Vice Admiral Shiozawa, the director of the Air Headquarters, who is currently staying in Hokkaido with the combined fleet, to investigate the location of the Kuril Islands and Hokkaido where air force bases can be built and everything else. The Japanese Navy also insists that if the United States strengthens military facilities on its border, Japan's countermeasure is a matter of course. (Dentsu, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo, in the spring of last year, the Japanese military authorities attempted to complete the northern air defense, that is, to build airfields in Chamushu Island (the northernmost end of the Kuril Islands), Sapporo, and Muroran in the three places, and set up army and navy aircraft teams. Although the budget was insufficient and the required expenses were not calculated, the Sapporo airfield was roughly completed under the pretext of opening civil aviation. The air route is also scheduled to be officially opened in the middle of next year. The Muroran and Chamushu Island airfields have also been investigated by specialists sent by the Army Aviation Headquarters, and the Hokkaido Prefectural Office has already set up temporary airfields. Now, because the US military authorities have recently urgently sought to complete the air force bases in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, it is said that the Japanese military authorities are also preparing to organize the above three airfields as soon as possible and seek to set up a permanent air force to serve as the northern defense line.

<p>Tokyo Newsletter The Army Ministry's 1934-35 national defense budget proposal was discussed and agreed upon by the Army Ministry and the Army General Staff. It is now planned to be submitted without making any concessions. The Army Ministry's new measures require a total of 40.6 million yuan, plus the basic funds of 200 million yuan, so the number of the budget proposal will exceed 600 million yuan. The brains of the Army Ministry and the General Staff recently held a joint meeting to discuss all new needs. The leaders of the General Staff firmly stated that the new funds required by the army are absolutely necessary for national defense and cannot be reduced strategically. All those present decided that they must insist on their demands to achieve their goals. It is expected that when the Army Ministry negotiates the budget proposal with the Ministry of Finance, there will be great difficulties. The new requirements decided by the Army Ministry meeting on August 27 contain the following items: (1) 130 million yuan for the Manchurian Incident, (2) 70 million yuan for air force and air defense supplements, (3) 110 million yuan for industrial reorganization, (4) 80 million yuan for improving military aircraft, (5) 16 million yuan for colonial troops and other needs. The Army and Navy provinces' demands for the necessary funds for the next fiscal year will put the Okada Cabinet in a difficult situation, because the Cabinet has no control over the Army and Navy Ministers and the Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff. They are all subject to the Emperor and can be the supreme commanders of the Army and Navy, and decide on the organizational system and the number of troops in peacetime. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>

<p>Tokyo, as a result of research in European and American countries on the use of civil aviation in wartime, it is known that large passenger planes can be converted into heavy bombers, Spears-style planes can be converted into light bombers, and postal planes can be converted into reconnaissance planes. At the same time, pilots can be trained. Therefore, huge subsidies are paid to the civil aviation industry to guide and encourage it. Japan will now develop the civil aviation industry that has never been involved in before. Mr. Chuangci will add 1.5 million yuan to the budget for next year, with Fukuoka-Taipei, Tokyo-Sapporo, Tokyo-Ogasawara, Tokyo-Nanyang Palau Island, Tokyo-Nagano Niigata, Huosaka-Matsue, and Tokyo-Dahe asking and so on as the center, opening a complex air route, to expand and prepare the situation of the civil aviation industry and the air route as the goal, and to realize it.

<p>Poland Plans to Propose Conditions</p>
<p>Demanding Extension of Protection of Minorities Treaties Swiss Capital The Federal Government's Foreign Affairs Committee met today for three hours. The issue of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations was discussed for two hours. The Federal President, Bille, and the Swiss representatives to the League of Nations unanimously decided that Switzerland should vote against the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations Assembly. The Foreign Affairs Committee then decided to submit this decision to the Federal Executive Committee for approval. (September 3rd, Havas report)</p>
<p>Warsaw Poland intends to demand in Geneva that the treaties protecting minorities be extended and universally applied to all countries, or else they should be abolished. Poland's demand at a time when Soviet Russia is about to join the League of Nations is significant. Because Soviet Russia has not signed the treaty protecting minorities, once Soviet Russia joins the League, if the Russian minority in Poland is dissatisfied with Poland's treatment, the Soviet government can appeal to the League of Nations Assembly, while the Polish government cannot enjoy the principle of reciprocity for the Russian minority residing in Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>(Note: All peace treaties after the European War, such as those with Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey, etc.) contained provisions stipulating that those countries, as well as newly created countries after the European War, should treat their minority ethnic groups equally with their own people, and there should be no discrimination in the enjoyment and protection of political and private rights. The treaty signed by Poland on June 28, 1919, with the major allied countries such as Britain, France, and Italy, also contained the same provisions in Articles 1 to 8. This kind of protection of minority ethnic groups is a general promise from Germany, Austria, and Poland to the international community, and not an obligation specifically to the homeland of a certain minority ethnic group. Therefore, any country that has signed this treaty has the obligation to treat any minority ethnic group within its territory equally, regardless of whether the homeland of the minority ethnic group has signed the treaty. In the case of Poland, its Russian minority is protected by the aforementioned treaty, and will not lose its rights because Soviet Russia has not signed it. Conversely, since Soviet Russia has not signed this kind of treaty, it has no international obligation to protect minority ethnic groups. Therefore, if Poles in Soviet Russia are discriminated against, the Polish government can do nothing about it. (September 3rd, Havas report)</p>

<p>The League of Nations Economic Committee drafted a report after its meeting from July 17th to 19th this year. The report has now been published and contains content that rejects the currently popular economic nationalism, stating that the policy of economic nationalism inevitably wastes the resources of various countries and causes various evils. Economic development can only be achieved temporarily by chance, but it is necessary to organize production and sales domestically and form economic groups internationally in order to revive and clarify the world economy. Once the economic mechanism is improved, the instability of currency and prices will disappear by itself, and commercial relations can be properly adjusted. Today, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries are willing to renegotiate tariff treaties with other countries and are gradually doing so. Once these tariff treaties are concluded, international trade will develop daily, and unconditional and unrestricted most-favored-nation clauses will be easily restored.

<p>The Day Before Was Labor Day</p>
<p>The General Strike Order Only Took Effect Yesterday</p>
<p>Ninety Percent of the Industry Halted Unions Prevent Riots</p>
<p>New York The textile strike began at 11:00 PM last night, but because today is Labor Day and factories are closed, the strike order will only take effect tomorrow. Gorman, chairman of the textile workers' union, announced that a number of workers in the underwear, brocade, velvet, and cloth industries will also join the strike, and said that some local unions have guaranteed him that the rate of participation in the strike will reach 100%. (September 2nd, Havas report)</p>
<p>Washington Officials of the All-American Federation of Textile Workers today predict that the textile workers' strike will spread to all parts of the textile industry by the end of this week. Gorman, vice president of the association, said that 90% of the industry will declare a shutdown on Wednesday. Local branches have sent telegrams expressing their determination to fight to the end. However, most of the telegrams stated that after Labor Day, when work resumes on Tuesday, pickets will carry out their duties, and the association will try to prevent riots if they occur. Gorman today sent a telegram to the governors of 42 states with textile factories, stating that union members will strictly maintain order, but requested the governors not to call out troops lightly, because this action will anger the workers and disrupt order. (September 2nd, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>New York Tomorrow is Labor Day, so the impact of the textile strike is not yet significant, but the situation is extremely worrying. The strike involves one million people, and there are communists among the strikers. The most worrying thing is that the Communist Party will never let go of the opportunity to use the unstable situation to incite workers to riot. President Roosevelt is in close contact with the labor movement, but has not yet announced his mediation plan. It is believed that if President Roosevelt decides to intervene, there may not be any action before Tuesday, because the first real test of the general strike will only be clear on Tuesday. Employers claim that strikers will account for 15%, while union leaders say that all textile workers will join the strike. Philip, a local official of the National Recovery Administration, today telegraphed William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, claiming that the strike was completely irrational. Sloan, president of the Textile Society, issued a broadcast speech asking textile workers not to blindly follow the strike, and said that he had received telegrams from textile workers all over the country opposing the strike. Most factory owners in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, advocated opening factories as usual, while labor leaders said that factories that do not stop work must be severely picketed and forced to close. The Fall River Independent Labor Party in Massachusetts today voted against the strike. Although several factories in New England announced their closure today, most manufacturers announced that they would open as usual on Tuesday. The Chicago International Ladies Garment Workers Union today threatened to limit employers to accept their demands regarding working hours and wages before October 1, otherwise there will be a strike.

<p>Washington Aubrey Williams, advisor to the National Recovery Administration, said today that the government expects there will be five million households on the relief rolls by February next year. This new record is caused by drought and increased winter unemployment. The Chicago official site has used 300 million yuan for disaster relief. (September 2nd, Reuters report) Washington Aubrey Williams, advisor to the US Recovery Administration, predicted today that more than 23 million people will need government assistance this year to resist the harsh winter. This is the third section of the report that Mr. Williams submitted to the President and was delivered today. Mr. Lee's estimate is based on a survey of disaster relief work and the future. Rural areas have been devastated by drought this summer, and the number of unemployed in industrial areas has increased. Therefore, by February of next year, there will be five million households that must rely on government relief. As for previous relief work, Mr. Lee's report stated that in 1933, the total amount of money used by national relief agencies was US$792,268,529. In the first six months of 1934, it has reached US$546,397,037, an increase of about 40% compared with last year. Due to the increase in special prices, it still needs to be increased.

<p>Chicago Socialist writer Sinclair, after being elected as the Democratic candidate for governor of California, is now traveling east to meet President Roosevelt. He gave a speech at the fair here today. Sinclair said that the reason he left the Socialist Party was that the Socialist Party is now dead.

In recent years, American socialists have only worked for the working class, so there is no room for transformation in their philosophy.

<p>Lin Chengxiu Discusses the Yellow River Breach Situation</p>
<p>Tianjin At 3:00 PM today, the Hebei Yellow River Flood Relief Committee held a meeting. Chairman Yu Xuezhong and the directors and members of each department attended the meeting. The following was decided: (1) Telegraph the Central Government to restore the Yellow River Disaster Relief Office and prepare for emergency relief and winter relief. (2) The province will raise as much relief as possible. (3) Send letters to various charitable organizations for relief. (4) Organize charitable horse races, organize entertainment donations, and organize charity performances. (September 3rd, special dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin Lin Chengxiu, Director of the Hebei Construction Department, returned to Tianjin after inspecting the Yellow River disaster. According to him, the reasons for the Yellow River breach are: (1) Menggang's small dam blocked the water, and the river water rose sharply and could not be discharged smoothly. (2) The new embankment is not solid. The Limin River section of Mutouzhuang Dachaji is mostly sand and less mud, lacking adhesion. After the water rises, the embankment roots collapse. At this moment, the cost of the levee is too expensive, requiring 140,000 yuan. If the water recedes, it will be enough to block the water with willow branches, which will only cost 50,000 yuan. More than 200 villages were affected in Changyuan, covering an area of 1,900 square miles, with a disaster-stricken population of more than 130,000 and a loss of 13 million yuan. More than 80 disaster-stricken villages in Puyang, covering an area of more than 900 square miles, with a disaster-stricken population of more than 50,000 and a loss of 2 million yuan.

<p>Tianjin The leader of the fake plainclothes teams that harassed Yutian has now been identified as Xu Shuangxia, who previously served as a brigade commander in Liu Guitang's department.

Xu Shuangxia was defeated in Gaoqiao Town, and his accomplices fled to Zunhua Xinglong. Another small group wanted to flee to Shichi. The provincial government today ordered the county security teams and police of Shunyi, Yutian, Baodi, Jixian, Zunfeng, and Wuqing to jointly suppress them. The Yutian security team and the Zunhua militia pursued the fake plainclothes teams. Thirty male and female hostages kidnapped on the 31st and 1st, including 9 Baodi county residents, 8 Jixian residents, and 13 Yutian residents, have all been sent back to their respective counties.

<p>Russo-Japanese Tension and Active European Diplomacy</p>
<p>The German-Polish Secret Treaty is Greatly Valued in London</p>
<p>If Japan and Russia go to war, Germany and Poland will Jointly Attack Russia</p>
<p>According to a special dispatch from the London correspondent of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on August 28, the Russo-Japanese relationship in the Far East is increasingly deteriorating, and in the complex European political situation, a surprising rumor has recently emerged, stating that if Japan declares war on Russia, Germany and Poland have concluded a secret treaty to jointly attack Russia. This rumor is considered powerful in London, because the German-Polish Ten-Year Political Agreement previously signed between Germany and Poland originally had secret conditions attached to it. The content of these conditions is based on the famous Lausanne-Belfort case, with the aim of turning a portion of Russian territory into its own colony. This is the important condition of the German-Polish military secret treaty. In other words, they want to take advantage of Japan's attack on Russia from the Far East to take joint action. Germany will advance with its navy from the Lithuanian region, and Poland will advance with its army from the Ukrainian region, jointly attacking Russia and heading straight for Moscow. In this way, Poland can separate Ukraine and take it as its own colony, gaining access to the sea in the Black Sea to reach the Baltic coast. Germany can also obtain access to the sea through Poland. This secret treaty has already been published in the Paris News, but the Polish authorities are vehemently denying it, without mentioning the aforementioned political agreement. The German side is also keeping silent. Furthermore, in terms of the cooperative approach between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Marshal Piłsudski, it is close to leaving France and becoming pro-German. This summer, Poland openly disapproved of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Treaty promoted by France, adopting the same attitude as Germany. This is enough to show that the German-Polish secret treaty is not false. However, in order to prepare for Japan in the Far East, Russia is eager to sign a military alliance with France and supports the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Treaty, so as to ensure the security of Russia's western border. At the same time, it has joined the League of Nations to strengthen its position. In short, due to the urgency of the Russo-Japanese relationship, the promotion of active behind-the-scenes work in European diplomacy is obvious.</p>
<p>The Yutian Pseudo-Plainclothes Team Flees to the Border Between Zunhua and Xinglong</p>
<p>They Plundered Gaoqiao Town Before Fleeing</p>
<p>Most of the Bandits are Remnants of Liu's Troops</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The pseudo-plainclothes team that harassed Yutian was jointly defeated early on the 30th by the four-county militia of Zunhua, Qian'an, Ji, and Yutian, in conjunction with the War Zone Security Replenishment Corps stationed in Yutian. After looting, the pseudo-troops fled with dozens of hostages to the border between Zunhua and Xinglong counties. This area is close to the Great Wall line, and if pursued urgently, they will flee to the border of the pseudo-Jehol Province. The provincial authorities believe that the suppression of this group of rebels cannot be delayed, so they have telegraphed the Zunhua County Magistrate, ordering him to make every effort to search and eliminate them. Currently, the county's militia and police are still tracking and pursuing them.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned bandit gang was discovered in Sanchaerhe, Fengrun County, on the 24th of this month. Later, they were besieged and suppressed by Zhang Renli, the Fengrun County Magistrate, and retreated to Fengniao Town. After being pursued, they retreated to Ya Hongqiao in Yutian County. After being besieged by the local militia, they were unable to stay and fled to Kongquezhuang, occupying it for a day and a night, committing the most heinous acts of arson, murder, and rape. The villagers fled at night and rushed to the county government to report. Chen Baosheng, the County Magistrate, led the police and militia to attack. Sun Jizhou, the Security Team Leader stationed in the county, also led his troops to assist in the suppression. The bandit gang resisted stubbornly, but in the end, due to the rapid attack by the police and militia, they seized Gaoqiao Town in the same county on the 27th. After entering the town, they piled firewood on the roofs of the people's houses and forced men and women to stand naked on them, threatening to set fire to them to prevent the police and militia from attacking. They also carried out large-scale robberies in the town, sparing no household, whether rich or poor. The police and militia, fearing the consequences, could only surround the town from a distance, cutting off traffic to various villages. By the 28th, the militia from the three counties of Zunhua, Ji, and Qian'an had gathered, and the encirclement became tighter. The bandit gang could not break through, so they searched the town for hidden weapons and forced the villagers to join the bandit party, thus expanding to 180 people. At about 4 AM on the 30th, the militia and police jointly launched a fierce attack on the town. The bandit gang could not resist, so they drove the villagers ahead and broke through, fleeing to the border between Zunhua and Xinglong. Before leaving, they looted the town clean, kidnapped more than 20 wealthy hostages, and set fires to disrupt the attack by the militia and police. As a result, hundreds of houses were burned down. After the incident, the Yutian County Magistrate entered the town to investigate and found dozens of villagers who had been brutally killed, their bodies abandoned in the wilderness.</p>
<p>It is said that 60-70% of this pseudo-troop are remnants of Liu Guitang's forces, and 30-40% are remnants of the pseudo-Jehol army. They fled from the Great Wall line and were recruited by people sent by Shi Yousan. Their original intention was to think that Zhao Lei and Liu Zuozhou would provide assistance, and the War Zone Security Replenishment Corps stationed in Yutian was originally Shi Yousan's old troops, which would be easiest to incite cooperation. Unexpectedly, although the team was usually domineering, they failed to maintain their proper roles. This time, they understood the righteousness deeply and refused to blindly follow, and assisted the militia in the pursuit, causing the pseudo-troops to be unable to resist and had to flee.

<p>Severe Flooding in Shanxi Province</p>
<p>River Water Overflows in Various Counties in the North and South</p>
<p>The Number of Disaster Victims is Estimated at 500,000 to 600,000</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer this year, various counties in Shanxi have experienced severe drought due to lack of rain in the spring. Unexpectedly, in the recent past, heavy rains have fallen from time to time in the counties along the river in southern and northern Shanxi, causing flash floods, which have resulted in disasters. The losses of fields, houses, livestock, and property have been enormous. No accurate statistics are available to date. Among them, the situation in Xia County, southern Shanxi, which has been flooded twice, is the most tragic. The provincial government, in addition to repeatedly telegraphing the central government to quickly allocate funds for emergency relief in the disaster-stricken counties, is also actively working with the Provincial Relief Committee. However, due to insufficient funds, even emergency relief is like a drop in the bucket, which is not helpful. Therefore, although the disaster in Xia County is severe, the provincial government, after several efforts to raise funds, was only able to allocate 2,000 yuan for emergency relief. The large amount of relief funds will have to wait for relief from the central government. The recent situation of the disaster-stricken counties is recorded below:</p>
<p>On the night of August 12, the Baisha River in Xia County rose, rushing directly into the city. At that time, the water depth was more than ten feet, houses collapsed, and people and livestock were washed away. The loss was unprecedented in the county's history. Unexpectedly, just as the accumulated water was gradually receding, on the 18th, heavy rains caused flash floods, and the river water re-entered the city along its old course, resulting in a second tragic flooding. In the first district of the county, Beishandi Village, Rensi Hou Village, Xinglongzhuang, Shangliu Village, Xialiu Village, and Chika. In the third district, Shijia Village, Zhang Guodian, Wang Kaikou, Wu Village Fort, Quancun, Yun Village, Xinzhuang, Xiaolu Village, Xuezhuang, Wangyang Village, Shangchao Village, Guo Village, Nanbeiwei Village, Hanwutong Village, Anzhuang Town, Gaojiayan, Maojiayan, Yingli Village. In the fifth district, Shangbeishi Village and other 40 villages were washed away, and the fields and houses destroyed cannot be counted. The people drifted with the waves, and it is not known how many died in the water. Moreover, the bodies of the dead were piled up everywhere and could not be buried. The property of the living was submerged, and they had nothing to live on. Wails of sorrow were everywhere, and refugees were on the road. The water depth in the city was more than ten feet, and the houses were soaked and collapsed. The residents gathered on the city walls and other high places to sleep in the open. The county government has carried out emergency relief, distributing one jiao of silver to each disaster victim every day. As for the detailed figures of various losses, the county is currently still compiling them. It has been found that 51 villages and towns in the city have been submerged, 120-130 people and livestock have died, 4,800 houses have collapsed, 130 hectares of farmland have been destroyed, and property losses are about 3 million yuan. The number of people in need of emergency relief is about 3,100. The county's fellow villagers in the province have repeatedly held meetings to discuss disaster relief measures and decided to print donation notices to raise donations from all walks of life for relief.</p>
<p>Due to excessive rainfall in Anyi, the water in the Zhongtiao Mountain gully rose, and the Yao Luo Canal overflowed. The houses in 19 villages, including Congshan and Xiayue, were washed away, with more than 100 families affected. Countless livestock, clothing, food, and grain were washed away. More than 20 people died in the water, and the crops were also washed away. In Guoxian County, due to the rise of the Hutuo River, more than 300 hectares of paddy fields in more than 20 villages along the bank, such as Dachao, Ronghua, and Motou, were submerged, and more than 40 people drowned. On the east bank of the river, in Ting Shangri Tou Village, a family of 18 went to the fields to pull wheat. The river water came violently, and they could not escape and were all washed away by the flood.</p>
<p>In Baode County, the Yellow River water rose out of the bank, causing the eastern part of the county, which was known for its prosperity, to be submerged. Countless merchants' property was washed away, and the houses collapsed after being immersed in water for a long time. According to the county's report, the Yellow River water is currently very turbulent. If it rises again, the county seat will inevitably be flooded.</p>
<p>In Wutai County, due to recent flash floods, the villages of Shangxia Jinshan, Sangyuan, Yangbai, Wangjiazhuang, Quanyan, Dabeidong, Daxing, and Huaiyin were flooded, countless houses collapsed, and the autumn harvest was washed away. More than 300 sheep were washed away in the Wangjiazhuang and Xishan areas, and two shepherds died.</p>
<p>In Pinglu County, after heavy rains, the Yellow River water rose out of the bank. Dozens of livestock were washed away in the second district of the county, and a total of 16 men and women drowned. In the first district, the fields and trees in more than ten villages, including Hejian Village, were washed away incalculably.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned counties are the most severely affected by the recent floods. If we include other counties with minor floods, the number of disaster victims is about 500,000 to 600,000. According to a person from the Provincial Relief Committee, the committee currently has only about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan in funds, which is the additional donations collected in various entertainment venues in the past few months. It is feared that it will not be enough to carry out emergency relief with this small amount. (August 29)</p>
<p>Joint Office Operations of Various Departments and Offices in Anhui Province</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Regarding the issue of joint office operations of various departments and offices in Anhui Province, after the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Liu Zhenhua, received an order from Commander Chiang, he convened temporary rigid meetings of various department heads and provincial committee members to discuss everything and decide on a plan. Taking advantage of the opportunity to arrange provincial political matters, he took his own plane to Liu'an on the 15th of last month to end the bandit suppression affairs in the border area of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and sent provincial committee member Chu Jingwei to Lushan to pay homage to Commander Chiang and discuss everything. Chiang gave some instructions on the plan, such as reducing the expenses of various departments and offices, which the provincial government had planned to reduce by 20%, but Chiang ordered it to be reduced by 25%. There were also some corrections in the organizational aspect. Chu has returned to the province some days ago. The joint office operations of the various departments and offices are due to the fact that the official residence of the Anhui government is the old governor's office of the former Qing Dynasty, which is relatively large. If it is to be rebuilt, it is not allowed by the current financial resources. Therefore, it was decided not to change the original site of the provincial government, but to try to operate jointly. It was decided to implement it on September 1st. The Provincial Government Secretariat and the Department of Civil Affairs have always been attached to the Provincial Government, and the Security Department is located in the old site of the Military Governor's Office next to the Provincial Government, so there is no need to move. The three departments of Finance, Education, and Construction were originally established separately outside the Provincial Government. The Provincial Government Secretariat and the Department of Civil Affairs each slightly vacated their original houses, and the Provincial Government Guard also vacated the houses in the second gate. The Finance Department is located in the east side of the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Education Department is located in the second and third buildings behind the auditorium. The various departments have already repaired and papered the designated offices and moved all the furniture and other items. The Finance and Education Departments completed the move yesterday (1st) and are operating as usual. The Construction Department will also be able to complete the move today (2nd). The Security Department has already opened a door to communicate with the Provincial Government. However, after the departments and offices of the Provincial Government operate jointly, they can directly issue documents to the directly affiliated agencies. The rest are all drafts handled by the department for the government, and the orders are concentrated and a general collection and distribution system is adopted. It is also heard that the various departments and offices of the Provincial Government had previously followed the orders of Commander Chiang and organized a General Office. Because the joint office system was implemented, it was closed yesterday. As for the reduction of staff and administration in the various departments and offices due to the reduction of expenses, the Provincial Government Secretariat and the Department of Finance have reduced the most staff, about 40 people. The three departments of Civil Affairs, Education, and Construction have also reduced staff by 10-30 people. The dismissed personnel have been assigned to other positions, and there are still a few who cannot be placed. Currently, the organizational system of the various departments and offices is: the Provincial Government Secretariat has four offices and two sections, such as the four offices of Legal System, Gazette, Statistics, and Technology, and the first and second sections. The four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction have one office and three sections, such as the Secretariat Office and the first, second, and third sections. (2nd)</p>
<p>Xiamen Public Security Bureau Cracks a Major Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>The Main Culprit is the Son of a Wealthy Family</p>
<p>After Shooting the Male Servant, the Body Was Thrown into the Sea</p>
<p>The Four-Year-Old Hostage Was Rescued by Detectives</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: On August 29, the Detective Department of the Xiamen Public Security Bureau cracked a kidnapping case. The main culprit, Zhou Xixian, is the son of the late famous doctor Zhou Muqing. Zhang Xixi is the son of the late Dong Zhang Wanrong of the Tongtai Ginseng Company. Both of them have inherited property. The others, Yang Laobing (Mianchang), Su Bingyi (former captain of the salt smuggling patrol), and Li Tiandao (son of the late Xiamen detective chief Li Qingbo), are from small families. The people of Xiamen were shocked by this. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Envy Leads to Hatred</p>
<p>Chen Xuanfang, the director of the Tirenhospital on Gongyuan South Road, has been a doctor for generations. His father was a famous doctor in Taiwan and established the Tirenhospital in Taichung. Several of his sons continued his business. It has been more than 40 years, and it is a large-scale private hospital in Taiwan. Eight years ago, Xuanfang came to Xiamen to set up a hospital and practice medicine. His business was very prosperous. Four years ago, Zhan Huihai, a doctor at the Zhan Eyehospital on Siming South Road, died of illness. Chen immediately took over the shop and changed it to the TirenEye Clinic, with his son Xinzhao in charge. Zhan Huihai's business was prosperous when he was alive, and Xinzhao continued it and became even more successful. Xinzhao has a son, only four years old, named Zhaoming, who is Xuanfang's eldest grandson. The whole family loves him very much. He lives with his parents in the Eye Clinic on Siming South Road and employs a servant, Chuan Zhenxing, 17 years old, to take care of Zhaoming. He has been doing this for two years. Xinzhao has a friend, Zhou Xixian, the son of the late famous doctor Zhou Muqing of Xiamen, who studied ophthalmology with Zhan Donghai. After Zhan's death, he tried to take over the shop but failed. He later established the Zhongwai Eyehospital in Fudi, but his business was not as good as Xinzhao's, and he eventually closed down. As a result, jealousy and resentment arose between them.</p>
<p>Kidnapping and Ransom</p>
<p>On July 19, Li Yushu in Xiamen was holding a funeral. Chuan Zhenxing took Zhaoming out to watch the fun and did not return in the evening. The family searched everywhere for him. They could not find him the next day, so they reported him missing. Chen is of Japanese nationality, and the Japanese Police Department immediately sent detectives to investigate, but they also failed to find him. On the 22nd, Zhang Xixi, a friend of Xinzhao, came to diagnose his eye disease and asked Xinzhao if it was true that his son and a shop assistant were missing. Xinzhao replied that it was true. Zhang came again and invited Xinzhao to cool off in the park, saying, "There should be news about this matter tomorrow or the day after tomorrow." On the 24th, Xinzhao received a letter from the post office, which read, "My teacher's shop has been occupied by you for more than four years. The right to use it for four years has been exclusively occupied by you. The average is 4,000 yuan per year, a total of 16,000 yuan. Your son is with me. You can borrow 16,000 yuan and I will send the child back. If not, your child will be killed within four days... Contact at Anxi Weijin, writer your fellow villager." On the evening of the 25th, Zhang invited Xinzhao to the Hainan Ice Room, saying that he knew all about the matter and could use Zhaoming's clothes as proof, but first he needed 200 yuan, and the ransom would be discussed separately. Chen rejected him. The next day, Zhang came again, saying that he needed to contact him in Anhai. At that time, Zhang's friend Zhou Zhengshan heard that Zhang was contacting the ransom and went to Zhang's house to warn his mother, telling Zhang not to get involved in the matter. Zhang did not come again, and Su Bingyi came out to contact him. On the 27th, he received another letter warning him to contact him quickly, otherwise the ticket would be torn. Yang Laobing and Xuanfang have been friends for three or four years and often came to Chen's house, where he was treated like a guest. He also went to Xuanfang's house and said that he could be responsible for contacting the kidnappers. Yang often ate and slept at Chen's house and was treated as a guest. On August 2, he received a second letter saying, "I heard that you must have evidence. Now I will give you your child's clothes and shoes. If you still don't believe it, you can cut off one of your child's fingers within two days to prove it. Now I don't want much money from you. I only want 3,000 yuan, and I will give you your child. If you don't, I will kill your child within three days. Please go to Gulangyu and look at your child's body. Please pay 200 yuan to the contact person first to express your gratitude." On the morning of the 3rd, Zhaoming's clothes, which he was wearing when he disappeared, were found in the seam of the back door of the eye clinic. "I will solve the problem immediately on Gulangyu. This is your last contact. Send Zhang, Zhou, Yang, Wu, and Liu. These people are all qualified to contact me." After that, Yang and Su went back and forth to contact him. The detectives once searched Yang's house. Yang was furious and roared at Xuanfang, saying that Xinzhao was too disrespectful to him. If it weren't for the sake of your old couple, I would have put Xinzhao to death. He suspected that Xinzhao had reported the case to the Detective Department and that he was helping to negotiate the ransom with good intentions. Xuanfang led Xinzhao to apologize and the matter was resolved.</p>
<p>Five Letters in a Row</p>
<p>On the 21st, he received the fifth letter, which was reduced to 2,000 yuan, saying, "1,000 yuan for the public, 1,000 yuan for Zhang, Yang, and Wu. Su will send it along with him. Su is a very good person and is not counted in the money. Pay the 2,000 yuan quickly and exchange the person back. It must be paid off within three days." On the 24th, Yang said to Xuanfang that he would go to Tong'an. 300 yuan might be able to redeem him. Xinzhao paid 100 yuan first, plus 10 yuan for travel expenses. Yang went to Tong'an with Zhang Xixi and Su Bingyi that day. Repeated letters were signed "Anxi Weijin", claiming to be in Anxi, and instructed Xinzhao to go to Anxi to contact him, saying that if he asked "Weijin" along the way, everyone would know him. At this point, he knew that he was actually in Tong'an. The next day, Yang and others returned, saying that the bandits must have 1,200 yuan to release him, and the 300 yuan was not enough for Zhaoming's expenses. Xinzhao couldn't bear it any longer and told Detective Department Director Lian Liangshun the whole story. Lian arrested Yang Laobing for questioning on the 28th. Yang said, "I only know that the bandits asked for a ransom of 1,200 yuan. Zhang Xixi entrusted Su Bingyi, and Su then entrusted me. For the sake of friendship, I came out to mediate." Then he arrested Zhang Xixi at the Youth Association.</p>

<p>Pudong Avenue Security Corps Members Bravely Capture Thieves: Recovered All Stolen Foreign Currency; One Thief Drowned While Trying to Cross the River</p>
<p>Ji Wanru, a native of Rugao, aged sixty-one, has been engaged in the pig trade for decades. Recently, he brought fifty piglets from his hometown and sold them to the Jiatai Pig Firm in Yangjing Town, Pudong, for 580 yuan. The day before yesterday afternoon, Ji went to the firm to collect all the proceeds. With seven companions, he planned to return to Puxi. They walked west along Pudong Avenue. When they reached Meiyuan near Qichang Store at around 5 PM, four bandits suddenly blocked their path in that desolate area. One bandit brandished a gun, scaring away Ji's seven companions. Another bandit stepped forward to cover Ji's eyes, while two others seized Ji's left and right hands. The last bandit searched and robbed Ji of the entire 580 yuan, and they fled in different directions. After losing his money, Ji chased after them, shouting for help to catch the thieves. Chen Chaohai, an inspector from the Cao'an branch of the Security Corps First Team, heard the cries and quickly led eight or nine corps members, including Su Zhixiang, carrying guns, to pursue the bandits. Near the Chaoban Bridge northeast of Cao'an, they intercepted two bandits, Shi Bailin and Ma Yingshu. All the stolen foreign currency was found on Shi. They saw another bandit fleeing south, and the corps members relentlessly pursued him. The bandit fired shots to resist arrest while running, fortunately without hitting anyone. He crossed nine small streams. The pursuers also bravely crossed the streams, closely following him. After three or four miles, the bandit fled to the Bailianjing Riverbank in a deep cave. Unable to swim across, with the pursuers closing in, the bandit jumped into the river in desperation. However, the water was deep. After briefly surfacing, he sank and disappeared. The corps members couldn't rescue him, waited for a long time, and didn't see him resurface. They believed he had drowned. The two captured bandits, along with the victim Ji Wanru and Xie, a partner from the Jiatai Pig Firm, were escorted to the Corps Headquarters. Corps Commander Xu Baoming interrogated Ji about the robbery. The two bandits were interrogated strictly. Shi confessed that he was thirty-one years old, a native of Rugao, and lived at No. 64 Taisen Lane, Youche Road, Xuejia Hamet. He had only been in Shanghai for four days. Ma confessed that he was thirty-four years old, also from Rugao. The other robbers were Guo Yi (aka Guo Asi) and He San. Guo escaped, and He San drowned. They specialized in robbing together. On the fifth night of the lunar month, they robbed the home of Li Miaosheng, a local guard in Longwang Temple in Nanhui County. On the sixteenth, they robbed the home of Li Xiaoqiu in the southern district, all four of them together, etc. Corps Commander Xu immediately escorted the two bandits to the Third District Public Security Bureau for investigation. The corps members who bravely captured the thieves were recommended to the Security Committee for commendation. After the two bandits arrived in the district, squad leader Li Xiaobao of the district detective team conducted separate investigations. Shi further implicated Guo Asi, who was on the run, as the instigator. He had invited them to a small teahouse in Yangjing to discuss the plan and then followed the victim, waiting for an opportunity to act. Squad leader Li then led detectives Zhao Bingquan, Jiang Binru, Jin Yushan, Hu Ruizhi, etc., to Pudong that night, together with police officers from the First District First Precinct, to arrest Guo in Taisen Lane and bring him to the district. According to Guo, the affair was instigated by Shi Xinjin, a worker at Jiatai Pig Firm in Yangjing, because he knew the victim had collected payment and instructed them to rob him. Squad leader Li then went to the firm and the Wusong headquarters to search, but Shi had already fled upon hearing the news. District Chief Shan Zhang interrogated the three bandits, who confessed truthfully. He ordered them to be escorted to the General Bureau for interrogation and ordered that Shi Xinjin be arrested and brought to justice.</p>
<p>This Year's Drought in Zhejiang Province Causes Tung Oil Crop Failure: This Unique Product Faces Uncertain Future; Japanese Transplant Tung Trees to Seize Market Share</p>
<p>Sichuan, Hunan, and Zhejiang are the three provinces in China with the highest tung oil production, totaling about ten million dan per year. It accounts for a large proportion of foreign trade, with the United States being the largest market. The production and sales this year are detailed below:</p>
<p>Drought Causes Crop Failure: Tung oil production in Zhejiang Province is concentrated in western Zhejiang, Sui'an, Chun'an, Changshan, Jiangshan, Yongjia, Dongyang, Yuqian, Changhua, Lishui, Longquan, Pingyang, Jinhua, Yiwu, Shouchang, and other counties. Farmers in these counties see tung trees as their only means of income because they grow quickly and can flower and bear fruit in three years. However, due to improper oil extraction methods, the quality is gradually declining in the international market, resulting in a decline in sales. Currently, farmers in Lanxi, Yongkang, Jiangshan, and other places have organized production cooperatives to improve production and promote sales to the European and American markets. This year, due to the severe drought, the crop is expected to be 100,000 dan less than last year.</p>
<p>Ringleader of Red Pill Factory on Pushi Road, Tang Atang and Others on the Run: Police Officially File Lawsuit, Trial Begins Yesterday; Defendants Were Hired Workers for Short Period; Debate Concluded Yesterday, Sentencing on September 7</p>
<p>Jin Jiulin, the Inspector-General of the Special Organ of the French Concession Police, along with detectives Zhang Ziying, Qian Yumin, Deputy Detective Zhou Bingcheng, and police officer Liu Dianlong, etc., raided a private red pill manufacturing facility at 310 Pushi Road at 00:30 AM on the 24th of last month. They arrested five manufacturing workers: Guan Xiaocai, Li Shifan, Chen Xiaolu, Chen Xiaosheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others. They confiscated 119 pounds of red pills, totaling 198,200 pills, as well as manufacturing materials and equipment. The prisoners were sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention, pending further investigation. It has been previously reported that the police found that the facility was jointly operated, and the bosses Tang Atang, Xu Xiaogen (aka Zhang Xiaogen), Zhang Ayu (aka Zhang Zeshan), and others had fled after hearing the news. The investigation was concluded, and yesterday at 10:00 AM, Judge Xiong Yunping, accompanied by clerk Tao Zongkan, arrived at the First Criminal Court. The defendants were ordered to be brought to court for further trial. First, police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the police's investigation process and filed charges according to Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. The police also submitted the confiscated red pills, materials, and equipment as evidence. Guan Xiaocai, 43, from Ningbo, resident of No. 487 Minguo Road, testified that he worked as a cook on the Taikoo Wenzhou shipping boat four years ago and met Tang Atang, who was a foreman at the time. At the beginning of August, he met Tang on Zhengjia Muqiao Street. Tang said that he and Zhang Ayu, aka Zhang Zeshan, had privately set up a red pill manufacturing facility at No. 18 Haineng Road in the Public Concession and asked me to work as a cook and do packaging, with a monthly salary of 18 yuan. I agreed, and Tang took me to No. 18 Haineng Road. He saw that the two-story facility had been set up, with two chemists from Guangdong, Da Luo and Xiao Luo, and workers Li Shifan and Chen Xiaosheng, etc., working inside. They worked three hours a day and produced 60,000 red pills, guided by the two chemists. After working for five days, Japanese police came to investigate the facility's second landlord, a Korean, so on August 19, the second landlord, a Korean, hired movers to move to another Korean's house at No. 310 Pushi Road. The Koreans from 310 took the red pills made and ordered Zhang Xiaolin, a rickshaw puller hired for two days, to transport them to a secret location. Li Shifan, 22, from Guangdong, testified that he came to Shanghai from Guangdong five months ago and stayed with Liu Da at Taoyuanfang No. 6, Minguo Road, Huajie, who asked him to look for work. On August 13, Liu recommended him to Zhang Xiaogen and Zhang Yu at No. 18 Haineng Road to work in the red pill facility. The second landlord of the facility was a Korean. There were two chemists, Da Luo and Xiao Luo, and workers Guan Xiaocai, Chen Xiaolu, Xiaosheng, etc., working together. My monthly salary was 15 yuan. We worked two or three hours a day and produced 60,000 to 70,000 red pills. Later, because the second landlord refused to renew the lease, on August 19, we moved to the third floor of the Wang Korean's house at No. 310 Pushi Road and continued working. The Koreans took the red pills made and handed them over to Zhang Xiaolin to transport them to Ji'anli, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, for storage. Zhang Xiaolin, 22, from Jiangbei, resident of No. 20 Daxinfang, Baoshan Road, testified that he didn't make red pills but knew about the situation. Three days after he started working, at 8 PM on August 20, a rickshaw puller called Asi asked me to work as a substitute for two weeks, stating that the daily wage was 5 jiao, including food and lodging. He took me to No. 310 Pushi Road, where I saw Wang, a Korean, who told me that I was not allowed to go to the second floor after starting work and was only allowed to stay in the kitchen shed. I went to work the next day. On the afternoon of the 22nd, a Korean carried a large bag, took my rickshaw to Ji'anli, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, stopped, and went into the alley with the bag, returning empty-handed half an hour later. At 4 PM on the 23rd, he still carried a large bag, took my car to Ji'anli, and he put it in which house, he did not know. But he knew that the bag contained red pills. The two chemists left around 8 PM on the 23rd. Wang, a Korean, was sleeping in the front room on the second floor when the search took place. Chen Xiaolu, 14, from Haimen, testified that three years ago, he was an apprentice at the earth firm at No. 21 Ji'anli, Zhengjia Muqiao Street. Atang (aka Tang Atang), who was on the run, was a foreman at the earth firm. In September of the 21st year, my mother died and I returned to my hometown. In March of this year, I came to Shanghai with my father, Chen Jifu, and my younger brother, Xiaosheng. On August 13, I met Atang at the entrance of Ji'anli, Zhengjia Muqiao Street. He recommended my brother and me to work in the red pill facility for only seven days before moving to No. 310 Pushi Road. The red pills were taken away by the Koreans. The bosses were Atang, Zhang Yougen, and Zhang Xiaogen. Chen Xiaosheng, 13, from Haimen, testified that the rest of his testimony was the same as that of his brother Xiaolu. The court verified the testimony and ordered the debate to begin. After the debate, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 7 PM on September 7. The defendants were returned to detention pending further instructions. The red pills and other items involved in the case were sent to the stolen goods warehouse.</p>

<p>Japanese Covet: Tung Oil Planted in Hunan and Sichuan Provinces is Sold Domestically and Internationally; Japanese Transplant Tung Trees to Seize Domestic Markets</p>
<p>Tung oil planted in Hunan and Sichuan provinces is sold to overseas markets and the northeastern provinces of China for domestic painting purposes. This year, the Japanese, jealous of the sales of tung oil in the Northeast, are sending people to Sichuan Province to purchase tung trees and transport them to Japan for planting. In a few years, they will be able to produce tung oil and seize the Northeast and North China markets. If our country's inherent foreign trade is once again taken by others, farmers will have nothing to rely on. Therefore, the province has strictly prohibited the export of tung seeds from China.</p>
<p>Eighty-Year-Old Woman Runs Flower Gambling Den and Opium Den: Uses Deafness and Muteness as a Shield; Will This Behavior Be Repeated?</p>
<p>Li Zhou, an eighty-year-old woman from Suzhou, lives at No. 14 Guanyin Pavilion in the city. Although her hair is gray, her spirit is still vigorous. She was previously caught by the police for setting up listening devices in the gambling den of Ah Bao in Huangyan to collect gambling money. The old woman pretended to be deaf and mute, and escaped being searched. Recently, the old woman secretly set up listening devices at No. 14 Guanyin Pavilion, collecting three tubes a day, about 200 yuan per tube, making a large profit. Zhao Zhenhua, the patrolling policeman from the Second Precinct of the First District, discovered that the old woman not only privately set up listening devices, but also set up opium lamps for people to smoke and profit from. He immediately reported to Director Liu, who led the police in disguise. Unexpectedly, the old woman used the same trick again, pretending to be deaf and mute. Zhao police immediately carried out a search and found opium lamps and other items. The search of the old woman revealed 32 flower gambling pattern papers, a flower gambling book, a folding clip, 55 silver yuan, 105 copper coins, an abacus, and an accomplice named Gu Shiquan. Both were taken to the Second Precinct of the First District for questioning. Director Liu interrogated the defendants Li Zhou and Gu Shiquan for privately setting up flower gambling listening devices and providing opium for people to smoke. The illegal behavior was extreme and they were sentenced to be sent to the General Bureau for strict handling.</p>
<p>Adulterous Affair Leads to Abandonment of Children, Widow's Tragic End: Penniless and Abused by Lover; No Face to Return Home, Commits Suicide by Hanging</p>
<p>Zhang Shangen from Kunshan ran an old furniture store at No. 963 Lujiabang Road in the South City. His wife, Wang, is 51 years old and has a son and a daughter. The son, Guanbin, is 18 years old, and the daughter, Xiaomei, is only 11 years old. After Zhang died of illness last winter, his son Guanbin took over the management of the store. Business was quite prosperous. A man named Ni Wencai (48 years old) from the city made a living by collecting old goods. He always sold the discarded old furniture he collected to Zhang's store, so he met Wang and others. After Zhang Shangen died, Ni, whose wife had died early, saw that Wang had some savings in her hands and was newly widowed. He seized the opportunity to flirt with her and managed to seduce her. Soon, she was so bewitched that she had an affair with him. Ni often stayed in Zhang's store, occupying the nest like a magpie, acting as the owner. All his daily expenses were provided by Wang, which caused Guanbin's dissatisfaction. Last month, he took the opportunity to drag Ni to the Second Precinct of the Second District. Ni Wencai was sentenced to ten days of detention and was permanently prohibited from visiting Zhang's store again. After Ni was released, Wang, obsessed with her lover, abandoned her children and secretly left home with all her jewelry. She lived with Ni at No. 56 Nancang Street outside Xiaonanmen. Unexpectedly, Ni had spent a lot of the woman's savings, and they were about to run out, so his affection for her gradually cooled. He often quarreled with her over trivial matters. At this point, Wang woke up from her dream and regretted her past mistakes. Seeing Ni's ruthlessness, she knew that this was not a long-term solution. So after dinner the day before yesterday, she packed up everything, intending to return to the store. Ni detained all the woman's jewelry and refused to let her take it away, leading to a conflict. In a fit of anger, Ni instigated his son Ni Chenggen (17 years old) to beat her up. Wang was old and weak and had no way to resist. She was seriously injured and had no face to return to the store. Overwhelmed with depression, she hanged herself from a belt on the doorpost at about 10 AM yesterday, while Ni and his son were unprepared. By the time she was discovered, she had been dead for a long time and could not be revived. Soon, the incident was reported to the police, who rushed to the scene and took Ni and his son to the Third Precinct of the First District for questioning by Director Jin. Because the case involved human life, the local leader was ordered to report to the court for an autopsy. The police were also ordered to summon the deceased's son, Zhang Guanbin, and send him to the Shanghai Local Court for questioning along with the defendants Ni and his son.</p>
<p>Child Playing in Front of Door Instantly Crushed to Death by Car: Wheel Runs Over Waist; Abdomen Ruptured and Intestines Spilled Out</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the truck transportation company at No. 129 Baike Road dispatched truck driver Wang Asi to drive truck No. 13444 with French Concession license No. 1618 to transport goods. At 6:00 AM, it drove east to west on Fuxu Road in the French Concession. In front of Li Hongji's palm mat shop at No. 305, the driver accidentally knocked down a tree on the side of the road and did not brake, rushing onto the sidewalk. At that time, Li Helang, the ten-year-old only son of the shop owner Li Heshang from Pudong, had gotten up and was playing in front of the door, causing him to be knocked down. The wheel ran over the child's waist, and his abdomen ruptured and intestines spilled out instantly, causing his death. The patrol officer rushed to the scene, detained the driver who caused the accident, and took the truck to the police station for investigation.

<p>Private Use of 90 Yuan Leads to Gang Fight Tragedy: Ten Thugs Swing Axes; Chen Aifu Severely Wounded</p>
<p>Chen Aifu from Haimen, resident of No. 155 Shanhai Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, was leaving home at 7:40 AM yesterday when ten thugs suddenly jumped out from the roadside on North Chengdu Road and attacked Chen with axes, causing axe wounds to Chen's right arm, left back, and back of the neck. Chen fell to the ground in agony. The thugs fled after achieving their goal. The patrol officer found the injured person and took him to Baolong Hospital. Because the injury was serious, he was hospitalized for treatment. The case was reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detective Weng Peiyu and foreign detective Blatter to the hospital for questioning. Chen identified one of the thugs as Liu Erniang, nicknamed Xiao Ermapi, who struck first. After a detailed investigation, it was revealed that the cause of the incident was that Chen and Liu Mapi were both unemployed thugs. Zhu Fusheng hired carpenters to build a house somewhere in Zhabei, stating a contract price of 380 yuan. When the project was completed, Zhu claimed that the carpenters' work was not good and refused to pay. The two sides quarreled, each inviting old friends (gang members) to mediate. Zhu invited Chen Aifu, while the other side invited Liu Erniang to come forward. They agreed to meet and start negotiations. As a result, Zhu's side paid 90 yuan to Liu to be handed over to the carpenters as settlement. However, Liu had to provide a receipt by the 15th of this month. But Liu had privately used the money he had received and was afraid that Chen Aifu would ask for the receipt when the time came. Therefore, he took the initiative, inviting nine like-minded people to hide with axes on the side of the road. When Chen arrived, they rushed forward and attacked. Chen was caught off guard and suffered a poisonous blow. The detectives immediately began to investigate Liu's whereabouts. At around 2 PM, Liu was walking on Shanhaiguan Road. With the guidance of witnesses Zhu Yongcheng and Chen Zhang, they arrested Liu and took him to the Xinzha Police Station for detention. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed charges according to Article 294 of the Criminal Code, aggravated assault, and stated the above situation, saying that the defendant denied committing the crime in the police station, but the defendant was taken to Baolong Hospital, where the injured Chen Aifu identified Liu as the first to strike. Currently, Chen's injuries are quite serious, and there is a risk of death, so he requested permission for a postponement. Judge Liu Yugui questioned the defendant briefly and ordered him to be detained pending further interrogation after Chen Aifu recovered from his injuries.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn, Little Western Paradise by Zhang Henshui, Chapter 5: A Ghost Carries a Group of Distant Guests from Guanzhong; A Destitute Family at the Ferry Laments the People of Qin</p>
<p>Suddenly, they heard: "Director Wu is here." After he arrived, Li Shilian's heart skipped a beat. What director? Was it the Finance Director? Or the Civil Affairs Director? He himself didn't have the status to visit the director, so the director certainly wouldn't be visiting him first; he must be visiting someone else's room. Sure enough, he heard someone from the next room welcoming him, saying with a smile: "Please come in, I've been waiting for you, old friend, for three hours." Li Shilian recognized the accent as that of Cheng Zhiqian, the one who had greeted him earlier. He addressed the director as "old friend," which meant he had considerable status. Li Shilian couldn't help but listen, so he banished all random thoughts and listened quietly. After a long conversation, he learned that this director Wu was in charge of students and couldn't assign tax bureaus to people. Later, he heard Director Wu ask: "Have you seen the Chairman today?" Cheng Zhiqian replied: "The Chairman is too polite to men of letters; he even invited me to dinner this morning." Li Shilian thought: "Oh! The Chairman even invites him to dinner; this Mr. Cheng must have considerable status. It would be good to connect with him!" He then heard Director Wu say: "Is there anywhere else you want to see?" Cheng Zhiqian said: "I'd like to visit Zhou Mausoleum. I wonder if there's a car available?" Director Wu laughed: "You're an old friend of many years; how could that be a problem? I'll send my own car for you tomorrow. My car can seat four people; if you have friends, they can come along. Tomorrow is Sunday; I might accompany you on the trip." Cheng Zhiqian politely declined a couple of times, and the matter was settled. Li Shilian heard Cheng Zhiqian seeing the guest out towards the courtyard and quickly rushed out himself. It's truly said, "Don't say you set out early; there are even earlier travelers." That Mr. Zhang Jiefu was already waiting under the eaves. He had probably heard everything Cheng Zhiqian and Director Wu had discussed. Li Shilian didn't care about him and went up to Cheng Zhiqian when he returned, asking: "Mr. Cheng, have you had dinner?"</p>

<h3 id="e66">Tiger Soup by Hanyu <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Tiger stoves arose to meet the needs of the common people; tiger soup is a side business of tiger stoves to meet the needs of the common people.</p>
<p>Every summer, a tattered lantern hangs in front of every tiger stove, marking tiger soup's location. Perhaps the lantern is so worn that the words "Clear Water Basin Soup" are illegible, but when common people see it, they know it's the location of a common bathhouse. Behind the tiger stove house, some land is specifically set aside and furnished with old wooden barrels that have already earned the boss a lot of money, which is tiger soup's only capital. To block the outside view, cloth is used for shielding. But later, it also became a special symbol of tiger soup.</p>
<p>After a day's work, especially under the unprecedented heat of the past sixty years, the dirt on the body is squeezed out by the heat along with sweat. Naturally, bathing is an unavoidable reality. However, those living in pigeonhole-like houses may still have space to bathe. So tiger soup has become the only summer bathhouse for common people. Every evening or night, many people take their clothes and head into the tiger stove; they are the patrons of the common bathhouse. To get rid of their dirt, they have to enjoy the tiger soup that the rich are not so lucky to experience, even though the price of a bath has risen from seven or eight copper coins to twelve or thirteen.</p>
<p>Although autumn arrives with the sound of insects in the corners of the house, the weather is still sweltering. Tiger soup's business remains unchanged from summer, which is a happy thing for the old men. But the thought of the cold weather that's about to come gradually diminishes their happiness.</p>
<p>Glimpses (Tao Jue)</p>
<p>Spring nights are suitable for reading "Romance of the Western Chamber"; summer nights are suitable for reading "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio"; autumn nights are suitable for reading Tang poetry; winter nights are suitable for reading "Dream of the Red Chamber."</p>
<p>Su Wen Zhong's eulogy for a skull says, "Yellow sand, dry skull, once a face of peach blossoms and plums, now unbearable to look at, then hateful not to see." Reading these words, one can understand the principle that form is emptiness.</p>
<p>The Vegetarian Mrs. Fu by Ma Ying</p>
<p>Anyone who lives here for a month will know that there is a good person here, and that is Mrs. Fu. The condition for her being recognized as a good person is being a vegetarian; isn't it true that vegetarians are the most compassionate?</p>
<p>Mrs. Fu is a long-term vegetarian. According to her own account, since she was thirty years old, her chopsticks haven't touched any meat. She originally didn't intend to be a vegetarian, but because she suddenly fell ill the year she turned thirty and almost died. Later, she had a dream in which she saw a monk telling her that her illness was because she had eaten too much meat in the past. When she woke up, she believed that the monk must be the Buddha. She vowed to be a vegetarian forever, and sure enough, she slowly recovered.</p>
<p>In her home, there's a small shrine with a tablet of the Buddha enshrined inside. In front of it is a woven straw cushion. Like Christians with their morning and evening prayers, she kneels on the cushion and chants the Buddha's name a thousand times in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>However, she's not kind to her daughter-in-law, and is even more abusive than others. Every day, besides her morning and evening prayers, she spends the rest of her time scolding her daughter-in-law and arguing with the neighbors. Everyone is afraid of her, because she's extremely vicious when she scolds people.</p>
<p>Her daughter-in-law, that poor little woman, under the oppression of this tyranny, her face is gradually becoming haggard and thin.</p>
<p>Records of Imperial Fragrance by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Well, just let her think about it alone; that won't do! Or she might become more and more annoyed, to the point where her anger rises and becomes uncontrollable. If that happens, we, who serve her, will be in trouble and often be scolded innocently. So, whenever she starts to ponder deeply, we quickly disturb her with interesting words to prevent her from thinking too much. This difficult task, others are unwilling to try easily, and it's usually left to me. But at this moment, I really hope she can think for a while longer and express some unique views. Therefore, I don't disturb her immediately. After a while, she says to me in a very low and painful voice:</p>
<p>"How pitiful this is!" As she speaks, she points through the car window at those desolate graves that no one goes to visit or pay respects to. "The people who lie buried in these mounds of earth not only suffered all kinds of hardships in life because they were too poor, but even after death, they couldn't leave any inheritance to help their descendants. As a result, their descendants are just as poor as they were, and they don't even have the means to sweep the tombs. We really can't help but feel considerable pity for them! But on the other hand, do people really have any feelings after they die? Aren't all dead people the same? For example, how glorious are we now? But once our legs are stretched out, everything is over! And once we're buried in the soil, our flesh and blood gradually rot away. Who can tell which are the remains of the imperial family and which are the bones of the lower classes...? It's not hard to imagine that the graves of these utterly destitute people probably wouldn't have been built at all if the local philanthropists hadn't generously donated money! So even if these graves collapse because no one takes care of them, their descendants can only open their eyes wide and shed tears. Unless some kind person comes out to help again, there's no way to repair them." (120)</p>
<p>Victims of Life by Yizhen</p>
<p>On the dining table, a new glass fly cover has been placed. Under the cover are some sweets, which immediately attract a lot of customers! Flies. After they gorge themselves, wipe their mouths, and try to fly away, they happen to fly into the cover, one, two, three... They all slip inside, and can no longer fly out the way they came. So they frantically and frantically crash against the glass cover, filled with the ambition to break through the glass. When they feel tired, they fall into the water. They struggle in the water for a while, and finally die belly up.</p>
<p>At first, I set up the fly cover because I felt they were too cunning and too dirty, wanting to "kill one to warn a hundred." But I didn't expect that greedy them, driven by life, couldn't take the frantic state of their kind in the cover as a lesson. They still swarmed in and fell into the trap one after another. This made me realize that my actions were too cruel and too despicable, killing stupid creatures without knowledge or awareness. Under this feeling, I loudly told them: "Friends! There's a safe way out below! Follow this path and escape this trap!"</p>
<p>But stupid friends, they can't find a way out themselves, and they can't follow the instructions of others to put them into practice. Alas! Victims under life's trap, the way out is clearly open. Just make useful struggles yourself!</p>
<p>But the flies, still drawn in by the bait in groups, still slip into the cover in groups. A way out?</p>
<p>Moonlight Reflections (Shen Shou Ruo)</p>
<p>People are always cruel in their hearts; perhaps charity is only on their faces. But some people don't even have a charitable face.</p>
<p>People are all reasonable; there is absolutely no unreasonable person in the world. The saying, "The public says the public is right, the wife says the wife is right," proves that people are all reasonable.</p>
<p>People are absolutely selfless in modern society. Look at everything like rulers, kilograms, companies, apartments, highways, parks, public pits, etc., all of them are public; there is a state of "forgetting self for the public"!</p>
<p>World Wonders (Bing Yu)</p>
<p>The Oldest Holy Book</p>
<p>The British Museum in London recently purchased the world's oldest holy book from Soviet Russia, called Sina, for a value of 100,000 pounds sterling. After the museum obtained this precious book, visitors flocked to it like a sea of people. The daily admission fee brought in several thousand pounds, recovering the capital of 100,000 pounds in less than half a month. It is said that this handwritten holy book was written in Greek more than 1,600 years ago and is considered on par with the Vatican Holy Book stored in the Roman Papal Palace. It is written on delicate parchment, filling 388 pages. In 1858, German holy book scholar Tischendorf discovered it in a monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai in Palestine. Later, the monks passed it on to the Russian emperor. After the Soviet government was established, it was first discovered by an American, who negotiated several times, but the transaction failed due to the price not being agreed upon. Now, it has fallen into the hands of the British.</p>
<p>The Biggest Advertisement</p>
<p>Last March, the German Ikay Canal Industry Joint Stock Company invited domestic and foreign journalists to the Repeleke factory outside of Cologne on the Rhine River. On that day, the world's largest aerial advertisement was constructed in the factory, using electric lights erected at a distance of 55 meters, with a height of 126 meters and a weight of 12,000 tons. A wire mesh was installed between the factory's two chimneys, forming Bayer's cross-shaped "Bayer" with a large circle around the word. In the large circle, there were 2,220 electric lights (the same shape as the trademark of Bayer pharmacies). Its diameter was 72 meters, and its circumference was 220 meters. The height of each character was 12 meters.</p>
<p>The Tallest Height</p>
<p>There is a tall man in England named Kamirkang, whose height reaches 11 feet and 3 inches, making him the tallest man in the world, breaking the record. It is said that he was already over 5 feet tall at the age of five. After that, he grew one foot every two years. Because of his height, he suffered various inconveniences, whether standing, sitting, or lying down. Even the tables, chairs, and beds had to be specially made.</p>
<p>The Oldest Forest</p>
<p>Recently, the world's oldest large forest was discovered in the port of Uozu in Toyama Prefecture, Japan. This large forest has sunk to the bottom of the sea and turned into a petrified forest. According to archaeological research, due to crustal movement in ancient times, this large forest was buried in the sea. The roots and trunks of the trees have a circumference of three to four fathoms, totaling more than 80 trees. Now, the Japanese government wants to build Uozu Port, but Japanese geologist Dr. Wakimizu Tetsugoro fears that the original form will be damaged during construction. He has joined forces with local philanthropists to vigorously promote its preservation. The Japanese Ministry of Education has approved his request and designated it as a natural monument area.</p>
<p>The Largest Bird Turtle</p>
<p>The world's largest unseen bird turtle was discovered in the Galapagos Islands of South America. It is four feet long and weighs about 550 pounds, almost like the largest turtle. Most strangely, the 18 pieces of armor on its back are used by aquatic insects as nests and habitats, and corals also grow on them.</p>
<p>The Smallest Dwarf</p>
<p>There is a strange person living in Los Angeles, USA, named Gall, originally from Czechoslovakia. He is 20 years old this year and only three feet and nine inches tall, weighing 13 pounds, like a two-year-old child. However, his speech and actions are no different from adults.</p>
<p>The Longest Iron Bridge</p>
<p>The world's longest iron bridge was recently built on the Tagus River in the Iberian Peninsula towards Lisbon, Bulgaria, starting one mile east of Lisbon and extending for six and a half miles. The Bulgarian government borrowed 9 million yuan from England, France, and Germany to build this bridge, and construction has now begun.</p>
<p>The Largest Food Consumption</p>
<p>The world-famous glutton Stephenk eats at least 30 eggs and 30 pounds of meat every day, and drinks 20 bottles of wine. Recently, his appetite suddenly declined, leading to illness and death. It is said that he was six feet and six inches tall and weighed 295 pounds.</p>

In the morning, overseas silver markets saw a contraction in the UK and stability in the US, with exchange rates still downstream. London spot gold rose by five and a half pence, US cotton rose by ten pounds, and US wheat rose by six two-five. Stock prices saw slight fluctuations. Reports stated that Washington believes that our country has increased silver export taxes and that there is a discussion on a partial or total ban on silver exports. They are currently consulting on the US policy. Sentiment was relatively strong. The price of goods opened at a flat rate and immediately rose to over forty-nine yuan. The same was true for gold industry preparatory trading. After opening, the situation stabilized and once rose to fifty-one yuan. Unexpectedly, HSBC quoted two re-listings, showing flatness in the UK but only a contraction of zero six two-five in the US. Sentiment was greatly impacted, and many people sold off, with the selling wind becoming fierce and the downward trend being very rapid. However, the exchange market was normal. With the aggressive purchases of large accounts and Guang Bang, the rebound was also continuous. After entering, both buying and selling became active. Gold prices then fluctuated around nine yuan for quite some time. Banks still had a selling appetite, and sellers were still willing to be active, once going downstream, but the chips were limited, and the surface turned dry. Sentiment was still stable, and it was still possible to raise the price after it went low. Before noon, it once rose to outside the fifty yuan mark. The closing price was flat. Although the after-market price was flat, there were many eager buyers. Western merchant brokers vigorously pushed the British exchange rate, and the gold market gradually rose to outside fifty yuan, once rising to one yuan and four jiao. Various foreign merchants and banks, such as McGregor, Citibank, Chase, HSBC, Mitsui, Korea, Lever, and Great Britain, transported huge amounts of cash silver for export. It was difficult for the exchange market to tighten, so the price fell again after rising high. At this time, due to a telegram from Mumbai reporting a decrease of two point two two two two annas, there was still a rebound, but the bank's appetite was blocked and the underlying trend was still loose. It eventually retreated to inside the fifty yuan mark. Mumbai reported no movement for the second time, and then a rebound of one point one annas, and then even lower, but sentiment remained firm. The closing price was still at the fifty yuan mark. The day's market felt dizzy, but with the increase in chips, the supply-side's strength was limited, so although the settlement price seemed to be close, buyers were still excited. There was a lack of special telegrams throughout the day, only private telegrams from foreign firms saying that the US government would purchase silver in large quantities in a month, with only a slight struggle. Now, the day's market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was nine four nine yuan and seven jiao, an increase of five yuan and six jiao compared to last Saturday. The price of goods opened at nine yuan and two jiao.

Shunmao, Fuyu, Dadecheng, and Dakang all advanced, rising to fifty-one yuan. Hengyu and Tongtaichang sold off, retreating to forty-nine yuan and four jiao. Shunmao, Yingfeng, Hengtianfeng, and Yongyongli still bought, rising to fifty yuan and five jiao, but McGregor blocked it, and the shilling was difficult to sustain, falling back to inside fifty yuan. Unexpectedly, HSBC quoted two re-listings, showing flatness in the UK and only a contraction of zero six two-five in the US. Sentiment was greatly disappointed. Hengyu, Tongtaichang, Dalian Bang, Yuanheng, Zhaofeng, Changda, Dadecheng, Hongli, Fuchang, Fuyu, Tongchun, Yuanxing, Yifeng, Yong, and others rushed to sell, immediately falling to six yuan and a half, but the downward trend was very temporary.

In the market, Yuanmao and Yong worked hard to buy, and Yifeng, Hengyu, Yongli, Yuqing, Yongqingyu, Hengxing, and others also had an appetite. The exchange market was normal and rebounded to fifty yuan. Daxing, Yongfu, Yuyi, and Tongtaichang sold high, retreating to forty-eight yuan and a half.

Mumbai also rose one anna, retreating to inside fifty yuan. Dadecheng and Tianfeng vigorously sold non-stop. McGregor came out with December US dollar six eight seven five, retreating to forty-eight yuan and eight jiao. Sentiment was still good. Dadecheng and Daxingyong took advantage of the low price to stabilize, and Yuanmaoyongyiyu also bought. The closing rose to nine five zero yuan. The price of goods was zero two jiao. The closing was stable. It was found that the highest price of the day was nine five one yuan and four jiao, and the lowest price was nine four six yuan and a half, with a swing of four yuan and nine jiao. As a result, it rose five yuan and nine jiao compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on HSBC bank's US dollar listing contraction of only zero six two-five, at thirty-five yuan three one two five, with a standard gold price of nine seven nine yuan eight jiao two fen. According to the closing price, it was about thirty yuan, less than a pressing, four yuan less than last Saturday. The price for this month's registration was nine five zero yuan, and for October it was nine four nine yuan. The make-up water in the morning was nine five zero yuan, and the make-up water in the afternoon was nine five one yuan. The price of red gold was nine six zero yuan and seven jiao, about eleven yuan higher. There was still a lack of transactions in the market.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Tianjin gang's attitude was silent. Nine nine three spot goods generally added fourteen yuan and a half, and inferior goods added twelve yuan. The spot goods company bought three to four thousand taels. The Central Bank opened a total of 630 cash positions, handled by various spot goods companies, with prices ranging from nine four nine yuan to nine yuan and a half. In the past, Dafengheng released 35 public orders, with Yifeng, Yongshen, Kangfu, Yuyi, Huiyuan, and Dadecheng each receiving seven orders.

<p>Chinese Merchants Aggressively Buy Foreign Exchange; The Trend is Still Tight</p>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange market was due to foreign telegrams. London big pieces contracted in both near and far terms by one eight seven five. American banks did not move, the British rate against the US contracted by one two five, the US rate against the British dropped by half a point, the British rate against the French did not move, and the US rate against the French contracted by one two five. London spot gold rose again by five and a half pence. The morning opening price for the recent selling price of British exchange was one shilling, five pence, zero six two-five, and British exchange was thirty-five and a half yuan, with both British and US rates tighter by zero six two-five than last Saturday's noon closing. After opening, it was flat. Then, due to presuming that the HSBC listing would show flatness in the UK and only a contraction of zero six two-five in the US, there was great disappointment. The gold market fell, and the exchange market loosened. However, the gold market quickly rebounded after falling low, and the exchange market became mediocre, lacking special changes. Banks still had a selling appetite, so there was a slight daze. Later, although the banks blocked, Western merchant brokers benefited, and the push for British gold was very fierce. Sentiment was originally good. Mumbai telegraphed a contraction of two annas, once slightly tightened, but various foreign merchants and banks were transporting cash silver for export. It was difficult for the exchange market to be very tight. Therefore, under the continued blocking by banks, the market was still flat. The closing selling price for the recent price of British exchange was one shilling, five pence, zero six two-five, and US exchange was thirty-five and a half yuan, tighter by zero six two-five than last Saturday. Chinese merchants bought about 100,000 pounds in shillings and 300,000 US dollars. Western merchants and others bought about 30,000 to 40,000 pounds in shillings. Now, the day's transaction prices are recorded below.</p>

<p>Silver Dollar Use in Guangdong Shows Tighter Situation</p>
<p>Recently, the summer heat has subsided slightly, and autumn supplies have begun to enter the market, causing the use of silver dollars to become tight again in the market. The silver exchange rate in the market yesterday was as high as one jiao and six fen, the highest record this year, and there is a continuing trend to increase. The added value for drawing, originally eight fen, then changed to five fen, which is also higher than last week. The silver exchange transactions were over 3.5 million in the morning and over 800,000 in new transactions. The noon market traded over 400,000. The small general association traded over 600,000.

<p>Also, the total number of silver yuan exchanged by the city's clearinghouse on the 3rd was 9,959,208 yuan, 7 jiao and 6 fen, including 5,390,321 yuan, 5 jiao in silver yuan and 4,568,887 yuan, 2 jiao and 6 fen in silver drafts.</p>
<p>The Corner Market is Firm, and Copper Coins are Slightly Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the corner silver market was that transactions were slightly smoother, and prices were firm. For Jiangnan small silver dollars, there were no transactions in the morning, and the price opened at 832 yuan. The price in the noon market increased by one yuan and five jiao to 833 yuan and five jiao, with 7,000 silver dollars traded. For Guangdong small silver dollars, the opening price was good by two yuan and three jiao in the morning market, at 744 yuan and eight jiao, and the price continued to improve by five jiao in the noon market, at 745 yuan and three jiao, resulting in a total improvement of two yuan and eight jiao compared to the previous day. In the early market, 65,000 corner silver dollars were traded, and in the afternoon market, 35,000 corner silver dollars were traded.

<p>The Money Industry Association's Standing Committee Proposed August Interest Rates</p>
<p>The daily price of silver in August seemed to be higher than in the past few months, with the total amount for the whole month exceeding two yuan and a half, reaching a huge amount of two yuan and sixty-seven jiao. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the Money Industry Association recently proposed the issue of interest rates. All members advocated opening two yuan, five jiao, and ninety-five percent discount. The result was a decision to increase by five jiao compared to the past few months, to two yuan, five jiao, and ninety-five percent discount, while the overdue interest would still be four yuan and five jiao, with the bottom code increasing incrementally, so the highest overdue interest would be ten yuan and five jiao.</p>
<p>Securities Debt Market Rebounded High</p>
<p>Rose Five or Six Jiao to One Yuan and Twelve Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a slight easing of the situation in Russia and Japan. The silver issue had already aroused the close attention of Chinese and foreign authorities, and there would soon be measures to curb or improve it. Therefore, although the foreign exchange rate was quoted at one jiao and six fen, slightly more than one fen, the market seemed no longer subject to its constraints. Northern gangs made up for their short positions, and retail investors also bought in succession. Market prices had already begun to turn around. It was also heard that the central government had organized a public debt regulation agency to avoid the danger of extreme ups and downs. The trend seemed to be turning around, and the difference between the lowest and highest prices had already exceeded ten yuan. Yesterday, the opening was created by the creation of the army, and there was still short selling, trying to exert pressure again, so the editing was slightly better. The long-term army was cut off, and there was no rise or fall at all. The 19th Customs was still less than one jiao, but with the change in sentiment, the momentum was difficult to contain. Later, various kinds rose gradually, from a few jiao to one yuan and one jiao. In the second market, the various kinds listed previously all increased in compensation from a few jiao to one yuan and three jiao. After entering the market, the short side relapsed and exerted pressure again, so from the gold short position, it fell two jiao to seven jiao, but the northern gang had already shown a short position to make up for, and the closing price of the coding fell sharply by one yuan. This situation was obviously created by a maker, still using pressure to try to disrupt the sentiment, but it was not allowed by the environment, so starting from the salt tax, it still turned upward and recovered from five cents, one corner to eight corner. Observing the trend, the opportunity has indeed turned around, and if the foreign exchange rate does not rise too high again, it should continue to rise. As a result of market prices, all rose, from five or six corners to one yuan and twelve corners, but the editing for this month was only five cents. The total number of transactions was still about 30 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are shown in the comparison table on the left (in yuan)</p>
