<h3 id="c17">全國職業勞作展覽會開幕　廷 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>本年四月五日。敎部通令各省市敎育廳局。於本年雙十節在京舉行全國職業學校及中小學勞作科成績品展覽會。以資比較和改進。後來因爲籌備不及。纔延期到今天開幕。我們敢向辦事人員道賀。并願乘機提出幾點意義來。爲參觀展覽者告。</p>
<p>（一）自國民政府定都南京以來·迭次宣示。今後各級敎育的設施。應以注重生產·實用·及改善社會經濟生活爲中心。而一般的敎育專家亦在大聲疾呼。（一）要養成兒童勞動的精神。啟發創造的思想。培養生產的興趣。及尊敬勞作的態度。必須提倡生產敎育。（二）祇有以生產爲中心的敎育。纔是職業敎育。我們要知道這幾年來大家提倡生產敎育的效果如何。雖然不能在這次展覽會中窺見「全豹。」最低限度亦能得到多少具體的證據來。换句話説。職業學校旣須以生產爲中心。除了農商二科的成績較難在展覽會中公開表現外。所有機械·電械·土木·化學·等科工藝品的陳列。當然可看做全國職校是否合乎理想的生產化的一種反映。至於中小學方面的勞作出品。雖只包括生產敎育中注重實地採作的一部分。而我國生產敎育在中小學校中的成就如何。亦不難因此而略見一斑了。</p>
<p>（二）在今天展覽會中所見到的。無論是職業學校的出品亦好。中小學勞作科的出品亦好。總是各校學生們「靈肉一元的結晶體。」但我們千萬不要太偏向於功利主義的眼光去批評。説其中有好些東西。旣當不得玩具。更當不得用具。因此就把他們所藴藏的一切價値都抹殺了。要知道學生成績品展覽會。根本不能和什麽巴拿馬博覽會芝加哥展覽會等相提並論的。有人曾説。生產敎育本不應過於注重生產的結果。而應注重敎育的結果。實有獨到的見地。就是勞作敎育的基本目的。亦無非使學生能從行爲上去求得知識。和改變向來輕視勞動的士人心理罷了。這二點如能辦到出品的精良與否。亦就不甚緊要了。</p>
<p>（三）在職業學校的出品中。我們要注意有多少是合乎學校所在地的環境和原料供給情形的。據我們調查的結果。我國農科學校的所在地。每非農村事業的中心點。而工科及工藝學校。又多偏重於新式歐美的工藝。忽略了當地固有的工藝。在這次展覽會中。不難看出這種流弊來。看出了流弊。就可作爲實地糾正的參考。再者。東南沿海各大城市的工商界。向來和内地是異常隔膜的。現在有此機會。大可溝通聲氣。互相扶助。然後職業敎育才有發揚光大的可能。</p>
<p>（四）中小學勞作敎育的範圍很廣。如掃地·抹桌·蒔花·植樹·保管校具·洗滌衣服招待來賓·練習救火等等都在其内。我們不要把製造勞作品的活動。當做勞作敎育的整個活動。參觀這次展覽會的人。如單憑某校勞作品的優劣。就斷定該校勞作敎育的成敗。固不免有武斷之嫌。而各校當局。如在參加展覽會以前。就抱定了患得患失的心理。偏重於勞作品的製造。而忽略了其餘種種的活動。亦就誤解了勞作敎育的眞意義了。我們感覺這次展覽會使命的重大。不敢不能這點一併指出來。</p>

<p>對比率制堅决不讓步</p>
<p>日本野心所在尙未明</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　政府方面確悉日外相廣田所派遣之代表在倫敦海軍會議席上對於日本海軍政策未有新表示、亦未提出足成倫敦會議之希望、官方對於日本之動機實屬不能理解、蓋日本佔據上海及滿洲之時、列强雖明白表示不滿其行動、但未加抵抗、今不知何所據而提出國防安全及遠東不侵略之議、因此政府及私人觀察者現信日本之眞正作用尙未揭露、消息靈通方面現認美國將取堅壁清野之態度、堅持維持原狀、促使日本廢止華盛頓條約究欲何爲、屆時其野心所在不難揭穿也、（二十九日國民電）</p>

<p>海軍堅持平等原則</p>
<p>對僞逐步實現兼併</p>
<p>（東京）　廣田外相於三十日午前十時、在貴族院關於外交演説如左、余曾於第六十五屆議會關於日本帝國之對外方針、已獲陳述之機會、其後内閣雖經更替、而仍得繼行當時陳述之方針、以之處理外交案件、隨後槪觀日本對外關係、藉悉日本帝國在東亞之地位、列强之理解認識、業經漸次增加、其與歐美各國及中華民國之關係、亦因此陸續增進親善、此余以爲至堪欣幸者也、余現在且將上屆議會以來之日本帝國外交、擇其二三重要問題報告其經過於茲、</p>
<p>海縮方針　至目下在倫敦召開之海軍軍縮豫備交涉、係以日·英·美·三大海軍國爲主體之會商、實際至關重要、故其進行狀况、當爲日本帝國所注視毋忽者也、英國政府欲使海軍軍縮會議易於進行、乃申請在倫敦之關係各國舉行個别之豫備交涉、此爲今年五月十七日之事、日本帝國政府對於上項豫備交涉之舉行、認爲適當、乃卽通告同意、結局自六月十八日以來關係國間於是在倫敦開始交涉矣、大致關於明年召集正式會議時之手續問題、最初交换意見、自十月在再次會商席上、由日·英·美·三國間關於軍縮之實質問題行使交涉、日本帝國在上項會商之際、主張鞏固國防、須保持充分之兵力、同時欲確立不威脅不侵略之原則、蓋日本素主排斥從來之比率主義、應於關係國間設立兵力之共同最大限度、且爲發揮軍縮精神起見、力圖縮少軍備、以資和緩國民負担於將來、倘在訂立恊定時應將上項共同限度盡力减低、同時將攻擊上之兵力極力縮少、整備防禦上之兵力、而使各國難攻易守、日本代表仰體上項方針、以圖貫徹主張、並繼續努力於訂立合理之新約、日本帝國對於英美及其他關係各國希其諒解日本主張之公正妥當、因此而成立新軍縮恊定、以期增進世界和平、乃其熱望也、至豫備交涉之經過、現因未便公布、故不能詳細説明於今日、異日有機仍當陳述也、</p>
<p>日僞關係　我盟邦「滿洲國」以其獨立國之精神、而其健全之發達、在日本脱離國聯當時、詔書上已煌煌垂訓、蓋此乃日本帝國根本關心之事也、爾來該國内外諸政更形進展、至本年三月樹立帝制、奠國基於永遠、至堪慶賀、是以天皇陛下於本年五月欽命秩父官殿下渡滿、以表慶祝、於是日、「滿」兩國之關係愈臻緊密、此爲吾人不能不同申感激者也、</p>
<p>日俄關係　至於日本帝國與蘇維埃聯邦之關係、自余在上屆議會報告以來、稍有良好之趨向、如北洋漁業竟能於平穩中得以實行其事業、可爲兩國國交上足以慶賀之處、又如中東路之讓渡交涉、本年春初一時雖陷於停頓狀態、而其後自三月復行開始交涉、中途迭次雖遭遇難關、因帝國政府盡力介紹斡旋其間、故至今已將其代價總數及其讓渡上重要條件之大部分、業經彼此同意、現在未告解决者僅餘三四項手續問題而已、此種事項内容繁雜、故其解决尙須若干時日、但擬盡量提早、以期完成交涉耳、</p>
<p>印日貿易　其次關於對外通商關係、茲將其主要案件之經過加以説明於下、日本與英領印度之通商交涉、已於本年二月由日印雙方代表關於實質上之意見、大致表示同意、而於製定條文之際、印度方面乃提出二三重要原則問題、致交涉一時陷於停頓、至四月十九日漸由雙方代表間行使非正式之條約調印、其後由日英兩國政府間將日印通商條約及其附屬議定書完成正式簽訂、復經雙方批准、訂於本年九月十四日起實施矣、爾來徵諸迄今之實續、得悉此項條約之運用、至爲順暢、日印貿易在大局上實繼續有滿足之發展、此爲兩國間極行可喜之現象也、</p>
<p>荷日會商　最後關於在巴達維亞召開之日荷會商、原以荷蘭本國及荷屬南洋貿易蕭條、且鑑於日本對荷印出口激增、乃於本年一月荷蘭政府爲調節起見、關於現行日荷通商條約、欲製爲新恊定、以補其不足爲目的、於是申請設法召集會商、此爲開始日荷會商之原因也、日本代表團與荷印代表團彼此討論各種問題、迄今已達六閲月、雖經努力妥恊以圖結束、奈問題極其複雜、歧途多端、直至今日雙方意見尙未充分一致、然日本帝國政府始終以公正妥當之主張以應付之、凡對方提案對於兩國利益相符而有實現可能者、無不充分考慮、力求妥恊之道、並希望該項會商能於最近之將來得到滿足之結果、以便增進日荷兩國之親善關係也、</p>
<p>最後結論　以上所述、均屬最近日本帝國外交上之重要案件、尤以現在進行中之各種案件、均須使之達到圓滿妥結、以資與關係各國互增親密、而期於一般國際情勢上更有所貢獻也、目下内外時局適値嚴重之秋、關於我國外交方針之實行上、非舉國一致、朝野各方面共同恊力不爲功、是則余所衷心翹盼而不已者也云云、（卅日日聯電）</p>

<p>對「滿」關係機關之調整、因事變以前之帝國機關、不足應付事變後顯著變化之情勢、此無待論者、於此尊重「滿洲國」之獨立、考慮該國與日本之特别親善關係、同時改革在滿機關、藉以保持對滿行政事務之統一、由政府總其成處理對「滿」事務、而其機關已能邀免急激之變化、足副以治安工作爲第一義之現實事態、雖其過程有多少之粉糾、可爲遺憾、然其根本趣旨均已諒解、因此誤解與杞憂已一掃無餘、此次提出之預算案及法律等、均爲刻不容緩者、希望從速恊贊、（三十日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）　今日高橋藏相在衆議院之財政演説如下、</p>
<p>今年不幸、國内各地災害頻仍、有北陸地方之水災、九州四國之早魃、東北地方之冷害、兼有朝鮮之風水災、均與地方農民以多大之損失、且都市因風水災襲關西之總被害、復甚猛烈、於是災害始有浸及全國之概、罹災地方人民之疲弊困憊、實不忍目覩、又因蛋價之低落、致養蠶地方亦甚貧困、政府因救濟恢復此類災害地方、及實施各項對策起見、於一般會計以二億一千一百餘萬金作爲臨時費、其多數於昭和九·十·兩年度支出恢復災害之需長期事業者、計畫自十一年以降亦繼續支出、故於此次提出之昭和九年度追加預算、爲七千另六十餘萬金、更於昭和十年度爲六千五百十餘萬金、昭和十一年度以降、亦擬支出七千五百四十萬金、至於臨時經費總額内容、計内務省所轄災害土木費始水事業費等一億一千六百九十餘萬金、農林省所轄風水災養蠶地方各項設施費等六千八百三十餘萬金、文部省所轄災害地方小學校建築費等一千六百五十餘萬金等、其外尙有大藏省陸海軍司法商工遞信等之九百四十餘萬金、爲調查風水災等之復舊費、又一般會計方面各災害之救濟設施、計通信事業特别會計資本帳三百餘萬金、同業務帳一百四十餘萬金、鐵道之資本帳四百六十餘萬金、朝鮮總督府之一千另二十萬金、均擬自昭和九年度以降支出、又九年度之追加預算、計關係災害之一般會計爲内務省轄内三八·九○○、農林省轄内二四·○○○、文部省轄内二二·○○○、（單位千金）</p>
<p>尙有大藏省陸軍省海軍省司法省遞信省等所管轄者爲五百六十餘萬金、此外復有外務省日荷會商代表委員派遣費十八萬七千金、大藏省管轄對洲事務局設施費六萬餘金、又其財源除普通歲入之百○八萬餘外、全部仰給公債、再特别會計方面關於災害設施者、通信事業資本帳七千萬金、事業帳百四十萬金、鐵道資本帳三百十萬金、朝鮮總督府四百三十萬金、其財源由增加通信事業之歲入、鐵道上年剩餘金、及朝鮮總督府之上年剩餘金等、對於災害地方除以上各項設施外、對於罹災者復有减免租税、延期徵收等等、並由存欵行儘量供給低利資本、扶助復興、該欵之通融金額、預定爲總額二億金、九年度爲九千六百餘萬金、並擬由銀行面貨欵中小工商業者、謀通融資金之圓滑、再政府以預算爲基礎、努力於救濟復舊、但國民各自亦應防患於未然、使天災等之損失輕微善用各種經騐、俾轉禍爲福、最後希望恊贊本預算云、（三十日電通電）</p>

<p>政友會山本抨擊政府</p>
<p>責在華日官缺乏統制</p>
<p>要求及早廢止海軍約</p>
<p>（東京）　衆議院已於三十日午後一時九分、在異常緊張之空氣中舉行開幕、先由首相外相及藏相等演説後、乃由山本悌二郎開始第一陣之質問、對於總理大臣之施政方針、質疑如左、</p>
<p>岡田首相對於議會政治之理解、及政黨之必要性、謂爲已有認識、吾人不能承認、因岡田首相實際上以官僚爲中心、而行使獨裁政治、乃其眞意也、</p>
<p>其次關於駐滿機關問題、則非難政府之無統制、應由首相負統制上之責任等語、復關於農村問題及財政問題外交問題通商問題等等略述如左、</p>
<p>貿易之新天地、尙有若許開拓餘地、倘從此樹立確切之國策、努力開發新天地、則貿易前途自當毋須悲觀、而政府關於貿易前途之對策、並未訂立任何政策、當爲遺憾者也、</p>
<p>以國民爲背景之政黨、並未作爲根據、而搜集新舊官僚分子組織官僚内閣、豈能發揮打開國難之强力乎、</p>
<p>山本氏述至此、乃要求岡田總理之答辯、於是首相起而答曰、</p>
<p>所謂目無政黨之説、斷無其事、欲舉其議會政治之實則有之、</p>
<p>山本氏復被政友會席上諸人所慫恿、於是再次登台、其質問中尤以關於軍縮問題及對華問題演説如左、</p>
<p>日本代表堂堂皇皇向英美代表提議軍備平等、及各國共同之限制方式、吾人對於此項努力、均應表示敬意、但不知政府爲何遷延通告廢除華府海約、查該項條約與我方主張之軍備平等、絶對不能兩立、當不待言、故其廢除乃國民全體確切不移之公意、且廢除此項條約、原非破壞國際恊調、旣爲貫徹我方正當之主張計、則通告廢除應在此次預備會商以前、至少亦須在預備會商提議我方主張之先、然究不知爲誰顧慮爲何躭憂而逗延至此耶、至於欲伴同其他某某等國行使細微之外交技倆、及足以引起關係各國對於我方之决意有所疑慮而已、其於促進會商、决無任何利益存乎其間、關於此點、希望總理大臣给與明白之答覆爲要、</p>
<p>其次則爲對華問題、關於對華外交方針、原非早有定案不可、乃據謂在外官憲以各人任意之方針、擅自開始行動、以重要之對華外交、置之於此種狀况之下、豈非漫無統制而何、事關外交機密、深恐不無觸犯之虞、是以吾人亦未便更形詳細質問、但旣經述及至此、政府亦當有所感獨、吾人縱不欲强求解釋、而對於此點亦希總理大臣給與答辯也云云、（三十日日聯電）</p>

<h3 id="c95">猶國國王亞力山大第一被剌因果　烈山 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>（猶哥斯拉夫國通訊）</p>
<p>巴爾幹半島、素來被人家認作歐洲的火藥庫、不獨是上一次世界大戰的導火線、由此而引起人類空前的浩刦、就是所謂凡爾塞和平條約的簽訂、早又種下未來戰爭的禍根、特别是年來備戰的聲浪、遍佈於全世界、所以巴爾幹半島上的舉動、尤其要引起人家的注意、</p>
<p>世界大戰的結果、使戰勝國與戰敗國間的予盾、更加深刻、實際上自然巴爾幹問題、本身也過分的複雜、例如宗敎問題、少數民族問題、親法系與親德系的政治問題、這種種在戰前早就成爲無法解决的苦惱事件、而今日呢、這道鴻溝、更是無法彌縫、不獨保加利亞時感失地之痛、思有所振作、單以匈牙利而論、就有三四百萬匈牙利人、隨失地而分居於羅馬尼亞·捷克斯拉夫·猶哥斯拉夫·三國中、而成爲三國中最嚴重少數民族問題、因爲不只在本國内的匈牙利人、想恢復昔日的繁榮、就在國外的匈牙利人、也感受到他人的壓迫、想早獲得自由、重歸祖國、加之意大利想揷足在多瑙河流域、並巴爾幹半島上、因之與奧匈保等國連成一系、與小恊約國相對抗、這種緊張的形勢、幾乎時有爆發可能、只要雙方認爲有必要的時候、這中間特别是意大利與猶哥斯拉夫兩國、因爲爭亞得里亞海的領導權問題、衝突更烈、</p>
<p>猶哥斯拉夫國、歐戰前是塞爾維亞國、歐戰以後、因爲靠着法國的帮忙、分得奧匈帝國領土的一部分、於一九一八年十二月一　成立一塞爾維亞·格羅亞·斯洛萬王國、國土面積並人口、均較舊塞爾維亞國要增加至一倍左右、格羅亞·斯洛萬·兩族人、與塞爾維亞人、是同一種族的、戰前二者屬於奧匈的帝國、戰後在民族自决的口號下、歸併於塞爾維亞國以内、雖然大家是同一種族、但究竟因分離過久、合併以後、三族間的意見、始終未能一致、在國會中所謂政黨之爭、幾乎就是各族間的爭鬥、因爲大家各有自己本族的政黨、另一方面、他們間所以不能够合作的原因、與宗敎的信仰上也不無關係、塞爾維亞人仍保留斯拉夫族人的普通現象、信仰希臘正敎、而格羅亞人並斯路萬人、則受了羅馬的影響、多信仰天主敎、於是這種形勢便愈鬧愈僵、直至一九二八年冬天、各方竟趨於極端的地步、内變的危機更加迫近、猶國國王亞力山大第一、感到此事的無法調停、便以非常的手段解散國會、並更改憲法、重新頒佈、於是事實上他一人便大權獨攬、實行獨裁、同時並將塞爾維亞格羅亞斯洛萬王國的名稱、改成今名猶哥斯拉夫（Jugoslnvian）王國、猶哥卽「南」字的意思、原意以爲三族人都屬於南方的斯拉夫族、所以不應再有彼此之分、此事經人民票决的結果、亞力山大第一便獲得勝利、確定　他的政權、而反對黨人於失敗之後、因　受到壓迫、大多數都逃亡於國外、猶國的内部政爭至此、表面上雖告了一段落、但反對黨人却更加不平、因之頗有鋌而走險的傾向、雖説亞力山大第一也曾努力過、在原則上猶國國境以内各民族間完全平等、不分彼此、而事實方面確實也曾實行過、但這仍不能消除原有的隔膜、猶國是一個新國家、並且是一個農業國家、雖也曾受過歐戰的創傷、但戰後所得之多、頗出意外、所以猶國今日的希望、在於維持現狀、在於努力内部建設、不希望再有風波發生、所以對内方面、只求其能够安定、對外只求其不與人家衝突、猶國便會心滿意足、但是鄰國的觀念、却正同此相反、意大利人野心勃勃、正想向外發展、恢復其舊羅馬帝國時代的威風、匈牙利人正在切齒他的失地、而一面確實也在臥薪嘗膽、以待時機、保加利亞人更無時不念念於他的失土、這就是説、猶國是處在三面包圍的形勢下、到了意大利與阿爾白尼的條約簽訂了以後、意大利的勢力更伸張至猶國南部的邊界上、總之、猶國是處在四面包圍的形勢中、</p>
<p>在這種形勢之下、空口説和平、自然是要失望的、所以猶國於一九二七年與法國訂軍事同盟的條約、更連絡羅馬尼亞·捷克斯拉夫·結成小恊約國恊定、以備萬一、然而終以意大利人的野心、猶國始終總覺放心不下、而竭力想突破意人的包圍計劃、於是在一九三三年間、猶王亞力山大第一便頭一次親赴巴爾幹半島旅行、漫遊羅馬尼亞·土爾其·希臘·諸國、回國後、便與各國訂立一巴爾幹條約、爲的保加利亞人始終對於猶國未能諒解、於是本年十月間、亞力山大第一更親赴保加利亞、接洽雙方的合作、據各方報告、此行結果極佳、倘果能如此、則萬一有戰事發生時、猶國可以無東顧之憂了、</p>
<p>亞力山大第一自保遊返猶後、便乘戰艦赴法、他此行的使命、最重要的自然仍是意猶間的問題、因爲法國年來恐懼德國的心理日增、想在可能範圍内與意大利妥恊、而法意兩國的接近、非先將意猶間的予盾解决掉不可、所以亞力山大第一此行、對於猶國的前途關係極大、但是不幸、當他到達馬賽的時候、上岸不到十分鐘卽遇剌、迎接他的法外長巴爾多、亦在同車中被害、兇手爲保加利亞人、屬於保加利亞暗殺團中的團員、但據各方的意見、此次暗殺案與保國無關、而最受嫌疑的却爲意匈兩國、</p>
<p>據猶國政界中人傳出的消息、多年來在意匈兩國境内利用猶國的反對黨人、組織有一别働隊、時常出入猶境、暗殺政界重要人員、并作暴動的準備、據説、曾經破獲過多次、兇手也曾供出種種内幕、而此次兇手等一羣人、是由匈國經瑞士、再用假捷克的護照入法、兇手所用的武器、是一種最新式機關槍式的手槍、是屬於軍用的武器、因爲上面没有廠家的名字、假如不是由於一個國家軍事機關的供給、單這武器、兇手就無法購買得到、自然其中情節是很離奇的了、</p>
<p>自從猶王亞力山大第一被剌以後巴爾幹的風雲一時突然又顯出十分緊張的形態、戰事幾乎有隨時爆發的危險、然究竟因各方都準備未週、大家還未曾利用這個時機來動手、此時所爭執的、無非是道德上負責的問題、小恊約國這一面在猶京伯爾格拉特開會、就是想把此次事件整個的責任向意匈兩國身上一推、那未意匈兩國在世界輿論上、便會顯出弱點、相反的、意匈等國那一面却竭力把這個事件認作是猶國内部的政治暗殺案、與其他各國無涉、目前大家正在這方面大打筆墨官司、戰爭的危險、總算暫時避免掉、雖然、根本的衝突、不獨照舊存在、經此次事件以後、反而有更加擴大的傾向、</p>
<p>猶王死後、猶國内政暫時并不受若何重大的影響、對内對外的政策、大約仍奉行他已往的政治路綫、王位現由王子彼得繼承、稱爲彼得第二、彼得第二現年十一歲、政權由三位攝政者共同負責、直到彼得第二達到十八歲時爲止、三位攝政者、計王子保羅、前敎育部長司但考味區并伯羅味區博士、</p>
<p>猶王的棺木、由猶國的戰艦從馬賽運回、於十月十八日在首都伯爾格拉特舉行葬儀、當日來自全國各地的人民、計達數十萬、特别是塞爾維亞的農民、致祭之哀、使人感動、原來塞爾維亞國久在土耳其統治之下、亞力山大第一的先人、原是塞爾維亞族的富農、曾集衆與土耳其人奮鬥、後得帝俄的帮助、始脱離土耳其成立一候國、而亞力山大第一的先人、亦因之獲得王位、所以猶國王室與農民間的關係、與其他各國是大有不同的地方、此次亞力山大第一一死、塞爾維亞族農民的哀悼、便更悲切、因爲猶國的有今日、由一個被壓迫民族的地位、奮鬥成一個一千四百萬人口的獨立國家、在一般農民簡單的腦海中、這一切都是猶王亞力山大第一的功勞、</p>
<p>亞力山大第一生於一八八八年十二月十七日、是故王彼得第一的第四子、早年受學於日内瓦、後學陸軍於舊俄都彼得格勒、到了一九零九年、他的長兄王子喬治自動繼承王位以後、亞力山大第一便正式算是嗣君、一九一二年與土耳其人的巴爾幹戰爭、他曾任總指揮官、他的戰功、便使他成爲一般人民的偶像、當一九一四年世界大戰爆發以後、彼得第一便將全部政權交與亞力山大第一管理、特别是軍隊力面幾乎完全由他一人指揮、到了一九二一年八月十六日、他的父親去世以後、他便正式繼承了王位、一九二二年六月八日、與羅馬尼亞的瑪利亞公主結婚、共生有王子三位、卽今猶王彼得第二、王子湯美司拉夫、現年六歲、并王子安得勒、現年五歲、總之、猶國王室在本國中有了比較穩固的基礎、所以雖在這個時代的潮流中、而且又當亞力山大第一被剌以後、却仍能够維持現狀、這倒不是一件容易的事情、將來的形勢、大約仍要看意猶事件的何發展、因如猶國是個農業國家、没有嚴重的失業問題、自從本年旱災遍佈了全世界各地以後、農產品物價高漲許多、這給予猶國在經濟上不少的帮助、所以猶國人民窮困是免不了的、但却能够養活一家人、他們的食住問題、勉强都可以解决的、他們所缺乏的只是現金而已、較之工業國家、總算略勝一籌、</p>

<p>正因爲如此、所以猶國的内政、暫時還可以穩定下去（十月廿八日於伯爾格拉特）</p>

<p>許久許久的時候，他才微笑道：人呢，我是看了不止一次，也交談過、會與不會，那都没有關係。我所要知道的，就是他們對這個姑娘，究竟打算怎麽樣呢？小紀微微的杠了兩下肩膀道：假使賈老爺願意討一個姨太太，這很好辦，他們也不是靠姑娘發財的人，無非是日子過不過去，把姑娘聘出去了，有個安身立命之所，就是他家裏兩代人，也不會餓死，説到錢上面，我想他們總也不能够張着大口吧。賈多才噴出兩口烟，才用不甚要緊的樣子答道：就怕他們不大明白這些。你想人家花錢討姨太太，不會到上海北京這樣大地方去尋麽，爲什麽到西安這苦地方來討呢，我也不過是仁者之心看了這小姑娘，一家三代很是可憐，願意救他們一把。他們的意思，若只是想逃命，那總好辦。若是想發財，我可不敢領敎，請他們另找别人罷。説時，他就架起了一條腿，不住的搖幌着。小紀心裏也就想着，有錢的人眞是鬼，别人剛將就一點，他立刻就緊上一把。因道：當然是只要逃命罷了。你放心好了，他們那些不懂事的婦女，就是打算玩什麽手段的話，還玩得你賈老爺過去嗎？賈多才聽説，將烟捲取了出來，向痰孟子裏彈着灰，帶着微笑。小紀道：賈老爺你規定一個時間吧。賈多才到了這時，實在不好意思再推諉了，於是抬起手來搔搔頭髮，這才微笑道：我看還是你們規定罷。我若規定了時候，好像我是約他來的，婦女們的話難説，他們少不得又要拿矯，我看還是隨便罷。（七八）</p>

<p>爾時數看梅勝處，超山久如奇峯之突出矣。山居浙之杭縣臨平塘棲間，有公路可以摩託卡通焉，花時入其境，誠有如康南海生前所題聯語：「住羣玉山頭，入衆香國土」之槪。自一代藝宗吴昌碩藏魄於此，名流往遊者踵相接，聞蔣委員長亦曾偕夫人一度蒞止也。今茲十月先開嶺上梅之候，山中老梅，間已着花。點綴枝頭，方弗霽後殘雪，蔚爲奇觀。宋梅亭畔，昔經匪燬之報慈寺香海樓，番禺洗冠生君，方捐資重建：近已鳩工，落成之日，想正在梅雪爭春時也。當地土紳，共寺僧廣洲，亦方籌劃復興，不遺餘力；頃又自南宋福主故宅廢基，移來老梅一樹，枝斡横斜，勝於舊植，而蘚痕纍纍，眞又一趙家物也。冠生園又曾新闢梅林，罔不兢兢爲名山事業計矣·殘冬易遇，花時住遊定可一新耳目。海雲洞亦已整理畢事，境幽景美，堪擬湖上烟霞紫雲，且新築道路，從此不需跋涉山嶺。惟山中妙喜寺月前不戒於火，致兆焚如。梵宮紺殿，頓成灰燼，誠名山之浩刦也，月前史量才先生並曾往遊，史先生曩時且嘗搆屋三楹於報慈寺内，寺燬之時，此三楹巍然獨存。迺聞史先生不幸遭匪狙擊，山靈有知，想更哀悼弗已矣。</p>
<p>我依了茶房的話，走將過去，把房門開了以後，眞的發現我的一位親戚，正和一個女人交頸而臥，見了我，連忙穿衣起身，面孔紅紅的，好像有無限的羞慚，我心中默默地想着：「上海眞地萬惡的淵藪。都市眞是犯罪的地方！」</p>

<p>鄕下來了一位親戚，承他不棄，特來拜望我，當然啦，這地主之誼，我是義不容辭的。於是什麽吃飯呀，看電影呀，上遊戲塲呀，我是一一的去招待他，最後才借了ＸＸ旅社的Ｘ號房間，作爲安身之處。</p>
<p>爲了經濟的關係，我們借的是一個單房間，兩個人睡一張舖，我認爲在初冬的現在，是非常適宜的。於是，便安閒的睡下去了，我因爲白天多跑了一些路，身子非常疲倦，一會兒，已是夢見周公，呼呼地睡着了。</p>
<p>不料將近天亮的時候，我醒將過來，發現我的那位親戚，是不知去向了，這眞是非常奇怪，最後才由茶役的報告，知道他另外開了一個房間，有一位女人伴着他。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>不過後來光緒歸天之後，因爲並不曾舉行什麽盛大的喪儀的緣故，所以連帶也不曾有半件遺物送往奉天去收藏；但這是一種破壞歷代慣例的特殊處置，不能算是一種合理的辦法。所謂合理的辦法是應該把他日常所服御的衣飾，或使用慣的物件，恭恭敬敬地賚往奉天去珍藏起來。這個辦法還是清朝第一代君主丨丨順治皇帝所開創的，意思是不忘故土：同時還有增高盛京那些古宮的地位的意思。因爲聖駕和皇族中人旣已悉數遷到了關内來，奉天那邊的宮院便難免因空閉而不爲人所重視，現在旣有了這些歷代帝皇的遺物珍藏在裏面，又特地設置一個品級很高的武官，帶着一隊滿洲兵常年駐守着，這樣，便可使那些空閉着的宮院，旣不至完全没有人居住，而它們的地位，也在無形中抬高了。</p>
<p>我們先打第一座宮殿起始，挨過去逐一參觀。這第一座宮殿中所藏着的是清朝最初兩代的君主丨丨順治和康熙的遺物。我們一走進去，太后就像學堂裏的敎師一般的給我們講解起來：伊的口才本極流利，此刻更是有意的要把這兩代君主的歷史，鋪陳得偉大到無可再偉大的地步。如果我們閉上了眼睛，儘用耳朶來聽伊這樣滔滔不絶，口若懸河的演辭，我們一定會把這兩代的君主，當做天神一樣的看待。而且還會深信伊老人家是的確非常熟悉並關心他們的舊事的。（一八八）</p>
<h3 id="c181">走陰差 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>「走陰差，」這原不但是奇談，簡直是笑話。然而在鄕間，兀是相驚伯有，誰也確信眞有這一回事的。於是，走陰差者，便售了他的「鬼計」，一直没有打破這黑幕。</p>
<p>這就不是一個絶大的笑話嗎？好好的在世上吃飯穿衣的活人，怎麽會到陰間去服務，做那捉人的勾當。但那鄕人們終是深信不疑。他們深信的理由：説是陽世有地保，陰間當然也有地保，陽世有差役，陰間當然也有差役，陰間要到陽世捉活人，自然也須要有活人領導的。所以這走陰差，他們又呌做「鬼保正」</p>
<p>現在我就給這走陰差作個介紹吧：做走陰差的，也是普通的一個人，但多數不是無聊，便是無賴。據説他在陰間的閻羅王授職他做某一地段的走陰差後，逢到這一地段上有人將死的時候，例由他領導了什麽牛頭，什麽馬面，去到那人的家中捉拿。至於他在領導的當兒，好像預先得訊似的，突然地倒在地上，活像斷了氣的死去這麽一會兒，然後悠悠地清醒過來。清醒了，便對人訴説他在領導捉拿時的經過，和那死了的人的姓氏。那時的見到他的情狀，並聽得他的告訴的，誰不一百二十分的相信他，同時並給義務的宣傳開去。</p>
<p>然而，走陰差者，到底是有破綻的，不過在受愚者不易覺察罷了。話到這個破綻，也就是他的欺人的鬼計。原來據他自己説：他是有個名摺的，這個名摺上，就開着那將死的人的死的時期，到了這時期，他便領導牛頭馬面去捉拿了。但他又對人説：陰間也可拿錢運動的，你如行了相當的賄賂，便可除你摺上的名，可以多活這麽幾紀了。人情孰不畏死，這樣，他的鬼計便售了。</p>
<p>這眞不是奇談，簡直是笑話。然而他丨丨走陰差在羣衆的相驚並相信下，每得售他的鬼計。於此可見鄕村的風氣，鄕人的知識，實在閉塞得可憐，淺薄得可歎呢！</p>
<h3 id="c182">當心爆裂 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3 id="c183">鴛鴦湖 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 豎子</p>
<p>秋深了丨秋的景色也將跟隨着氣節的推移而逐漸消逝了。翱翔太空南歸的孤雁的悽鳴，深深地，深深地，撩起我無聊的情緒，而激起我的遊興。</p>
<p>鴦鴛湖，提起這一個名字，就怪使人陶醉似的。在過去，我也曾憧憬着那裏的美麗嫵媚的湖光，入詩入畫的菱塘，我也曾幻想投到這怪使人陶醉的鴛鴦懷抱裏去，可是爲了生活的驅使，幻想終於是幻想，雖然近年來，頻頻來往校滬杭道上。</p>
<p>這一個憧憬着的希望終於實現了。在一個雙十節的清晨，我和Ｃ君乘了七時五十五分的滬閘特快通車，途中經過了兩小時的勞頓，到了嘉興。</p>
<p>「遊湖去𠲎！搖船去𠲎！」在車站的門外，充滿了這樣的一片聲音。當我們走出站門時，兩側擠滿了的鄕村姑娘們，穿着樸素的服裝，帶着温柔的微笑，和純粹嘉興的口音，在兜攬着出站的每一個旅客。這些就是使得南湖更加嫵媚，更加生色的船娘啦！</p>
<p>所調「盧陸遺風」的所在，在嘉興這樣的地方，當然也不地例外。如在鴛鴦湖畔的東園，就是在這裏首屆一指的一座茶樓。我們先在東園進了一點清茶，順便就商量遊湖的計劃，籍以欣賞這大自然的景色。於是走出束園，買了小舟，搖過了滬杭路的鐵道橋，遠遠地獨立在南湖中心的烟雨樓，就先映進了我們的眼簾。湖面上三五扁舟，好似毫無歸依的，漂蕩菱葉之間。凉風拂着面，和着欵之聲，乃帶來了村姑娘的隱約可聞的採菱歌。這一幅依稀如畫的景色，是多麽値得欣賞而富有詩意啊！再仰頭回顧着太空，我們有如溶化在大自然之中一樣，便遺忘了俗世。</p>
<p>當我坐在舟中時，顧盼到艙内的陳設，於無意中發現了一個遊客贈給船娘的一首詩。這首詩，不知是出自誰人之手，但從字裏行間纒綿的味兒，却充分地表着這是出於一個多情人的手筆，我也就信筆把它抄下來：</p>
<p>「相逢何巧，相愛如膠，心心相印憑天曉！你並不姣，我並不俏，彼此偏都那麽好！春花開了，春水動了，大家爲春情顚倒！時光已老，别離嫌老，請追念當年今朝！别了别了，心别懊惱，請追念當年今朝！</p>
<p>甲戍春幕，於苦悶的生活中，發狂到禾，獨遊南湖，醉後興感，胡作上句以寄慰君女士留念白水廬主題」</p>
<p>在湖上閒蕩了半天，黄昏時分又回到了上海，可是一天的遊興，還烟似的迴旋在腦中。</p>

<p>今日在京考試院開幕會期十日</p>
<p>不舉行儀式共到三十省市出品</p>
<p>敎部主辦之二十三年全國職業學校及中小學勞作科成績品展覽會、於今日（一日）在南京考試院開幕、該會因限於會塲、不舉行開幕儀式、僅請各機關長官外賓及各省市代表與京市各校敎職員前往參觀、茲將該會情形、分誌於下、</p>
<h3 id="c185">成績展覽會籌備紀　周邦道 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>敎部爲推進職業敎育與勞作敎育之實施起見、因有全國職業學校及中小學勞作科成績展覽會之舉行茲當開幕之際、謹將籌備經過、約略紀之、</p>
<p>本年四月四日敎育部訂定覽會辦法、凡五章二十二條、通令各省市敎育廰局遵照　理、辦法要點、一、凡全國公立及已立案之私立高初級職業學校及中小學均須參加、二、籌備會會址設於南京、三、展覽期間定於二十三年十月十日起至二十日止、各省市區應於九月一日以前分别舉行預備展覽、四、出品範圍分兩部、甲、主要出品、爲（一）職業學校學生實習成績品及工作圖、（二）中小學學生勞作成績品及工作圖、乙、附屬成箱、爲（一）敎育行政機關成績、（二）學校行政成績、（三）敎學成績、五、出品手續、各省市區舉行預備會後、選擇代表成績、於五月十五日以前送到籌備會、六、出品優良者、由籌備會呈請敎育部嘉奬、或給予奬狀、其成績特别低劣、或必須參加之學校而未將成績送會者、則由會請部分别訓令注意、六月二十一日、八月十一日、先後電催迅速凖備舉辦預備展覽會、後以展覽會塲所關係、遂决定改於十二月一日舉行、八月二十九日以代電令知各省市敎育廳局、限於十月底以前、將成績品送到籌備會、並由各省市選派職員一二人襄辦成績之運送陳列保管等事宜、迄十月九日更令知數畢、一、關於免納關税一節、由部會同財政部印製免税護照、二、關於諭路運輸减費一節、准鐵道部覆稱、可比照鐵路運輸敎育用品特别减價章程第一條辦理、三、關於鐵船運輸减費一節、准交通部覆稱業飭國營招商局、依照原運價减半收現、以示優待、此敎育部關於舉辦展覽會令知各省市敎育行政機關之重要事項也、本會籌備委員、依照展覽會辦法第七條之規定、設十一人至十九人敎育部於七月二十八日、派科長戴應觀、督學兼科長鍾道贊、督學唐惜分、顧兆麐、周邦道等五人爲籌備委員、並暫由唐·顧·周·三督學担任常委、十月九日、加派科長鍾靈秀·徐逸樵·吴研因·喻德輝、專員厲家祥爲委員、（徐後因要公未擔任）、因展覽期近、事務紛繁、又於十一月十五日、加派司長顧樹森雷震、參事陳泮藻、秘書易克嶷、科長郭運峯爲委員、並指定顧司長·陳參事爲常委、</p>
<p>籌備會原分、一、總務招待組、二、徵集陳列組三、評判組、四、編輯組、後呈准部次長、將第二組改爲陳列佈置委員會、第三組改爲評判委員會、先後派定人員、總務組主任顧兆麐、總幹事周永楠、股長林冠英·彭述人、　仲·魏學智·幹事施瑋朱樹森王綸李偉光沈倫楊世偉等、陳列佈置委員會主任委員唐惜分、委員顧樹森吴研因陳泮藻厲家祥鍾靈秀等、幹事劉宜廷袁定華楊衍鈞婁詠琴翁之達沈慶熾薛天漢賈國恩楊景鍾舒余高志成段大甲黄龍光丁以忠等、評判委員會主任委員顧樹森、編輯組主任周邦道、股長易克嶷郭蓮峯、幹事王萬鍾黄問岐游春懋賀伯烈嚴格里莫國康管祖熊謝卓茲李若虛呂樹棠張廣馨趙成蔭等、外聘幹事鄒嶧桐樓桐茂趙汝森丁兆南陳哲近趙雪嚴書記尹昌年胡運隆等、籌備委員前後會議十三次召集全體職員及各省市代表會議一次、各組單獨會議若干次、但各項事務之進行、往往以非正式會議臨時决定之、</p>
<p>此次籌備最感因難者、厥爲展覽塲所問題、勵志社·青年會·華僑招待所·中央大學禮堂·考試院明志樓·交通部舊址及朝天宮等處、先後商訽察勘、而或以時間衝突、或以地點不敷陳設、或以整葺需費浩繁、胥不易解决、爲取建築壯麗、部位整齊、面積寛大、適於陳列布置、遂决定延展會期、假明志樓爲會塲、戴院長許秘書長慨然允准於審計人員臨時考試及考銓會議蔵事後、全部借用殊可感也、明志樓爲考試院試塲、與敎育有密切之關係、而舉凡高等考試、普通考試及特種考試所未規定且不易規定之實績的製造的職業科目與勞作科目、今竞得此機會、幅集全國成績於國家「選賢任能」之塲所、此其意義亦至足尋味矣、</p>
<p>籌備經費一萬一千二百餘元、經敎育部呈請行政院轉呈國府核准、於本年敎育文化事業預備費項下動支、因用途孔　、概算有限、故各方面均異常撙節陳列所需之器具、除目製木質梯形架·排架·板架等數百件外、承鐵道部將全國鐵展所用之鋼製橱櫃八十一件、悉數撥借、由平津運京、旣甚雅觀、又省費用、此種便利、感惠何如、</p>
<p>此次參加者、除新疆·貴州·西康及蒙藏外、計有江蘇·浙江·安徽·江西·河北·河南·山東·山西湖北·湖南·陜西·甘肅·寗夏·綏遠·察哈爾·四川·福建·廣東·廣西·雲南·南京·上海·北平·青島·威海衛·等二十六省市、東四省出品、業已呈報正在途次、總計已到出品、凡二十八類、二萬九千七百餘件、出品者、職業學校一百六十九處、中學三百三十七處、師範一百三十九處、小學八百六十八處、敎育行政機關七處社會敎育機關九處、敎育學術團體二處、會塲共分四館以延懋堂爲第一館明志樓下爲第二館、明志樓上爲第三館、熙績堂爲第四館、各館中省市單位、以出品之多寡、分别配置、重大機器、恐損及地板、故以第二館前之水泥地及草地爲陳列處所、而於後方空地上、搭蓋蘆棚兩座堆放架櫃及出品箱隻、</p>
<p>關於出品之陳列、因以　　每　省市整個的成績爲主旨、故以省市　單位每一單位以學校類别爲經、出品類别爲緯學校首職業次中學、次師範、次小學、職業以農·工·商·家事、其他爲序、中師小學工藝·農藝·家事·敎具、其他爲序、凡出品已破壞者低劣無價値者、及顯係贋品者、皆在剔除之列、蓋恐失展覽之本意也、</p>
<p>本會會徽、原擬畫一車輪、象徵新興工業、上傅篆文「心」「手」二字、表示手腦共練、雙手萬能、</p>
<p>全體籌備委員會</p>
<p>南京中華照相館攝</p>
<p>後經段次長造意、男女兩學生共同推動車輪、向前猛進、表示努力、勞動·合作與前進、特請中大敎授徐悲鴻氏繪稿、涵義豐富、頗堪珍視、</p>
<p>年來、國人對於職業敎育與勞作敎育已有相當之注意、從事敎育者、亦已有相當之努力、惟實際上所表現之成績、無從作全體之觀察與比較、此次集合全國作品於首都、作鄭重之展覽、需要之適切用意之深邃、自無待言、同人等竊擬於評判完畢時選擇優異成績、分别攝影、略仿日本全國小學成績品中央展覽會、所出之全國兒童模範作品集意、刊印全國職業勞作優良成績集（名稱未定）、俾得永資觀摩、共知策勵焉、</p>
<p>本會同人、因能力有限、時間倉卒、草草籌備、彌多疏略、搦管述此、蓋不勝慙悚之感云、</p>

<p>對日僑之請求未克照辦</p>
<p>公共租界工部局、對於日本僑民團體、請求改變敎育方針一案、近又再加考慮、本月廿八日之董事會會議、乃决定函復該團體、略謂工部局已就各種觀點、考慮此項問題、在目前對於任何外僑團體之敎育利益、殊不能再有所推進以致影響局方建校計畫、緣界内之華人敎育、亟待提高與擴充、不能因前者而妨及（華童學校）之建設、仍應暫照現行方針、酌量財力、增設局立學校、同時對於中外私立學校、照現行辦法、予以補助費、</p>
<p>查日僑原建議、計有四條、（一）停辦局立學校、（二）對各外僑團體之學校、予以補助費、（三）補助費之年額、即以一九三四年之敎育預算數包括經常臨時兩項）爲凖、（四）分配標凖、視學童數或納税人數之多寡定之、</p>
<p>當敎育委員會考慮之中、各華委員亦提出一意見書、主張仍照一九三一年原案進行、不應因增給補助費而犧牲增辦學校之利益、補助費固可達於較多數之學童、而增設局立學校、方足以提　敎育程度、是以兩者不可偏廢、且敎育處長六月間提出之報告、亦曾指明受補助之學校、程度大抵較低、而局方亦未能直接干預、故補助費之優點、仍須視費額之多寡、及各校之主管方面能否密切合作以爲斷、該意見書主張、仍遵見行方針、並繼續進行八年建築之計畫、此計畫完成後可以容納華籍學童百分之七·五、然亦僅足應付最低限度之需要耳、</p>
<p>敎育委員會最近會議時、對該意見書及日僑之建議、與財政上之關係、一併加以討論、對於原建議、欲以臨時預算内、由公債籌出之建築費撥充經常開支之補助金、認不合財政原則、且恐損及工部局之信用、</p>
<p>至日僑建議書中、指陳局立學校用費甚鉅、而得益者只爲少數之兒童一　、委員會主席意見、對此自應加以補救、敎育處長近曾有設立較簡陋學校之計畫、即係對於此方面之努力至於原建議書、對於補助金之各問題、或猶未深知也、渠意工部局之方針、旣含設校及補助兩端、今施行雖已三年、然仍未脱離試騐時期、就目前所能見到、似無犧牲建校計畫、而大增補助金之理由、關於此點、渠以爲華委意見書所論頗當、惟孽委以爲工部局之八年建築計畫、已成定案、不能改變一層、渠未能贊同、　原計畫係屬暫定性質、本容許後此之重加斟酌也、</p>

<p>— 林焕平</p>
<p>前幾天收到一位曾驚嘆過自己爲什麽會不跟着故詩人朱湘去的詩人一封信、裏面有「我總想離開這所謂文壇，當什麽小伙計或小職員之類去還好，第一，可以解决生活；第二，或許可以因實際生活的變换而寫些不同的文章。否則，我將絶望等的話。讀了不禁使我想起文人生活的困難，然主要的，却使我聯想到實際生活在文學上的重要性來。我在這兒就想很簡單的談一談這問題。</p>
<p>誠然觀察生活，不是實際的體騐生活，在我國的作家中實有人在。因爲没有實際體騐過來的生活經騐，單憑作家主觀的認識方法去觀察甚至臆測，結果，反映在藝術作品裏的生活同實際生活常有隔膜或不相符合的地方。這是在近幾年所生產的作品裏可以找到很多例子的。（自然，在這裏還有藝術家的技術等主觀條件存在的，不過實際的生活經騐的缺乏，可以説是主要的吧了。）所以，我現在讀了這位詩人的來信，以作爲詩人的人而想去當什麽小伙計或小職員，我是很表同感的。藝術家能够深入到實際的民衆生活裏去，總是比較混在所謂文壇上不作什麽事來得好的。（觀察生活的可能性和重要性，不能在這短文裏所能涉及了。）</p>
<p>實在的，藝術家不能不要知道生活。他是只有從現實，從生活裏去攝取自己的形象的。他的生活經騐愈豐富，他的形象的貯蓄也愈豐富的。因之，他也就能够更自由地爲着自己的形象和自己的目的去創造必要的故事的，商爾基曾説過，藝術家的生活經騐愈複雜，愈分歧，他也就愈被提高，拓大了眼界。這是不可移易的眞理吧。藝術家是必須要描寫眞實的。他要把現實在牠一切的眞實上，在牠的矛盾，牠的發展方向上，在那麽史的見地上，具體化於他的藝術的形象之中。藝術家必要把生活的眞實，要把牠的本質，通過有典型的意義的形象去表現出來。他不是處理概括諸種現象的一般的抽象的法則，他是處理從個體的對象或現象，結局是處理從直接生活裏取出來的現象，然後把最類型的現象在形象的感性的形式上去把握而且描寫出來。只有眞實性，才是一切偉大的藝術作品的前提。要是没有複雜豐富的實際生活經騐和藝術家的靈敏的感性及正確的方法，要像上述那樣地去把捉現實的眞實性，是辦不到的。巴爾扎克之所以是一個比過去，現在，未來的一切左拉更爲偉大的藝術家，正是在乎他在「人間喜劇」裏把他的時代的全體像反映在鏡子裏一樣地非常清楚的反映了出來。而巴爾扎克之能够達到這地步，不消説，也是在乎他的生活經騐豐富和他分析現實的方法的徹底，反乎他的世界觀而將客觀的社會現實，具體的形象化了出來。辛克萊的「屠塲」聽説是他在屠塲裏混過一點時間才寫出來的。高爾基的大多數作品，特别是「四十年」和「我的童年」等幾部自叙傳式的作品，都是他生活過來的實際生活的記錄。</p>
<p>親身深深地走進社會實生活的過流，綿密地觀察，體騐和了解生活，綿密地研究現實性，是一個偉大的藝術家的前提條件的。</p>
<p>我期待着給信我的那位詩人今後的偉大的詩歌的產生。</p>
<h3 id="c219">「精神的變形」 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 胡洛</p>
<p>向隅先生「認爲在俗人的社會中，精神的變形是一個孩子變做獅子，獅子變做駱駝。」我還不明白他怕「駱駝」是什麽意義。我對「駱駝」倒表示好感，我常想到一幅圖畫：一個遼闊的沙漠，駱駝們載着重物，懷着毅力，一步一步地前進着。這不是象徵着人生麽？駱駝載着人生偉大的使命，勇敢地向前方走。沙漠上，固然有狂風，缺乏水泉，但駱駝們却不顧這些，牠要完成牠的使命。這也是戰鬥的人生，因爲，駱駝得與飢渴，狂風鬥爭。所以，「孩子丨丨獅丨丨駱駝」的精神變形，才地最正確，最有意義的人生過程。</p>
<p>但是，在這俗人的社會中，「精神的變形」却並不像向隅先生這樣説的單純。「孩子，丨丨獅子丨丨駱駝」正是俗人社會中，精神變形的一種。至少，我們還可以找着其他的精神變形來。其實，這個社會便已够複雜，而人的生活情形，也極複雜。但社會畢竟是非靜止的，社會是向前變動着的。在變動的過程中，我們便可以發現好多種的精神變形來。我想，除了追社會而跑的「孩子丨丨獅子丨丨駱駝」精神變形外，只少還可以發現另外兩種精神變形來：「孩子丨丨丨丨丨丨猪玀」與「孩子丨丨獅子丨丨丨等」。自然還有其他的精神變形，但這幾種，要算最普遄，最典型的了。</p>
<p>「在酒樓上，」中主角呂緯甫便是一個精神變形的典型者，呂緯甫在幼年時，曾「到城隍廟裏去㧞掉神像的鬍子，」也曾因爲議論些改革中國的方法以至於打起來。」這正是由「孩子」變到「獅子」的黄金時代。但是·呂緯甫漸漸地踏進社會了，在社會變動着的浪濤裏，他被幾度地冲洗以後，他只有灰下心來，没落下去。他説「我現在自然麻木得多了」，「但我現在就是這樣了，敷敷衍衍，摸摸糊糊······」這便是再由「獅子」變而爲「豬」哪。現社會裏，這樣的人不是很多麽他們失去了少年時的勇氣，而過着「猪」似的麻木生活，只等待着那最後的宰割。社會上不是有許多人都在搖頭嘆氣地説：「人生無意味啊，」其實，正是他們放棄了人生。你看，他們打着「過一日是一日」的招牌，試問，這同「猪的生活有什麽兩樣呢。所以，這種精神的變形是：「孩子丨獅子丨猪玀。」</p>

<p>白天也像是夜晚，陰暗，晦霾，看不見半絲太陽光綫，到這時，便覺得即使是淡得發黄的一點陽光也如電爐一樣灼熱了。</p>
<p>夜晚，風來了。</p>
<p>是狂吼呢，使人想起一些深山叢林裏的披着毛皮的朋友們，張大着穴洞一樣的大嘴，緩慢地　着身子仰天長嘯。長嘯裏藏着的是不可一世的威嚴。</p>
<p>人的神經像快𤻋了的皮囊，在收縮抽搐，毛孔裏放進一些冷氣：縮𩓐子的冬天啊！</p>
<p>自己病了，那麽疲弱地。</p>
<p>緊裹着那條夏天丢到床底下的棉被，冰凉的空氣在没命地狠鑽呢。最好要像初步的嬰兒般紥在小被裏才行，還有，死屍放進棺材時也是要來一個五花大綁的。擁一擁睡塌了的枕頭，欣羡地笑了。</p>
<p>平日嫌太昏暗的十支光的電燈病中又嫌太亮了，對着燈躺，光綫刺得眼　快發痛似的惱了，轉過身去，白牆是一樣地刺激視學，把眼閉上吧丨丨</p>
<p>跑馬燈萬花鏡般的，全在身前身後搖幌了起來，自己變成了神話裏的千眼菩薩了，左也是光，右也是光，前前後後全是······</p>
<p>風佔領了世界啊！</p>
<p>靜靜地，樹葉子發嚮，聽得是老樹幹在搖撼，葉子落地了，一夥兒追着一夥兒地，和地面接起吻來，隨後樹枝又挺一挺勁兒，好大的勁兒啦！</p>
<p>猜得出來的，明早那兩顆榆樹和洋槐一定會像秃子一樣地光着腦袋，這是北國的痛快，黄樹葉子能在枝上停個把月，但一下子大風便能全給吹跑了。</p>
<p>忘了，窗前還有一棵覆盆子呢。</p>
<p>連門和窗也不老實起來，站不穩，前後仰合着：砰嘭，砰嘭······數不盡的。那窗子前兒個才因爲木頭漲了關不上，便打房主人的木匠那兒借來把刨子，給它去了一層，一起風又縮，便鬆弛了。</p>
<p>由它們碰去，好在門是反鎖着的，獨自個兒不怕鬼來。一挺身子爬起來，走到門那兒把燈捻滅了，雖然走廊裏的燈還在射進光來，究竟是微弱的，没有月亮的風夜呵丨鑽進被去，寒噤接連着，原來的病的灼熱散了一散，顂上浮了一層冷氣。平壓住胸，一陣惡心又來了，肚腸子上有小蟲在咬，針刺似地痛着。</p>
<p>習慣地，房主人的無綫電總是在夜晚唱着的，怎麽説了的呢，一隻久已被人遺忘的「落花流水」又來了，辨不出是誰的嬌嗓子。</p>
<p>暗駡着房主人的缺德，夜晚閙個不完。接着便······</p>
<p>「一個人離着挺老遠的家啊！」唸着，把臉往枕上使勁壓。不是麽，才來的家信還在枕邊擱着那上面有爸爸的半睜着眸子的嘆息，世紀末的凋落與混亂：弟弟的從稚幼的心裏發出的帶着感傷的話語，他懂得人的掙扎與苦鬥，艱苦使一個孩子早成并且聰明了！在媽媽的歪歪斜斜的字跡裏，流露着她的深沉的愛憐，那個，遮住了她對於人世所忍受的苦惱。</p>
<p>蔓爬着的藤蘿一樣的思緒都繞住了這顆病了的心。</p>
<p>在風佔領着這個世界。暗淡，猖狂。</p>
<p>睡夢裏，自己在風翼中馳騁。</p>
<h3 id="c221">明天（五） <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— （Josepb　Conrad）吴向隅譯</p>
<p>一切事都那樣地延攔下來，一切事也同樣地爲明天預備着。已有一箱子那麽多的一包包的花種選擇出來預備種在前面的園地，「我的親愛的，他無疑關於種花要讓你參加些意見的」，海格波特船長走過鐵栅後暗示着對她説。</p>
<p>貝珊小姐的頭低下去專心於她的工作。他曾聽到這一切好多次。但常常她要起身，放下她的縫袵工作，慢慢地走到木栅前去。這些温和的胡謅也頗有些魔力。他已斷定他的兒子决不會再因爲没有家的原故走開，他已替他預備了一個家了。他已在其他一個小屋中堆滿着各種的傢具。她揣想起來那一切都是新的漆過的，堆積起來，像一家傢具店中一樣。有着好幾張桌子，外面包着粗廉布；有着幾捲的地氈，粗厚的，垂直的，像幾條柱子的一部分一樣，還有着白大理石的尖端，從放下䉀子的暗中透露出一些光亮。海格波特船長常將他購買的物件形容給她聽，正像對着一個有合法權利用這些東西的人一樣。也許他的小屋中的荒蕪的天井就可以舖上三和土······在明天以後。</p>
<p>「我們即是連木棚也可以折去了。你可以把你的晒衣裳的綳掛到外面去，你的花可以不受糟蹋。」他的眼睛擠擠，使她頗有些輕微的羞報。</p>
<p>由於她的心中仁慈的衝動而滲入她的生活中的痴想，也不無合理的情節在内。有一天如果他的兒子回來，究將怎樣呢？但她連他究有没有一個兒子，她還不能十分確定；即假定他在某地，然而他總離開得很遠。當海格波特船長在他的談話中激起他的情感的時候，她也只好佯裝着相信，使他平靜下來，並且還略帶一些笑意掩飾她的不以爲然的情感。</p>
<p>只有一次，她曾對於那結果將歸失望的希望指出可疑之點，但他的嘗試的結局頗使她受驚不小。那位老人的面孔立即表現極端的恐怖與不信任，正像他在天體看到一條裂痕一樣。</p>
<p>「你丨丨你丨丨你不會相信他溺死了吧！」</p>
<p>在一刹那内，他，在她看起來，又將發狂，因爲在通常情形之下，他是比一般人所想像他的要理智得多。不過感情爆發後不久，即會恢復到以前極慈愛的極温和的狀態。</p>
<p>「不要受嚇，我的親愛的，」他略帶狡滑地説：「海不能留住他，他並不是航海中人。我們海格波特家裏的人都不是航海的，就像我：我就没有溺死。還有，他根本不是一個水手；如果他不是一個水手的話，他是一定要回來的。並没有什麽事件可以抯止他回來。」</p>
<p>他的眼睛又開始擠了。</p>
<p>「明天。」</p>
<p>她從此不再那樣説了，因爲他怕老人會立即發狂。他依賴着她。她看起來是鎭上唯一明白的人；他在她的面前公開地慶賀他自己能够替他的兒子得到這樣一個鎭靜的老婆。其餘的鎭上的人，他一次有些發怒，對她信任地説，是十分奇特的，那就是他們對你看的舉動丨丨他們同你談話的舉動丨他從没有同這地方的任何人相好。不要喜歡這些人。如果他的兒子從前喜歡愛柯爾柏魯克地方這件事他不曉得的話，他决不會離開他的故鄕。</p>

<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>我是個不懂世故的人，也不懂那麽去趨奉地方上的鄕紳，我的交際程度至多僅及到一個高等小學校的小學生，遇到地方上那些鄕紳們，我的心就着慌了。並且天生我不善於説話，那些會説話朋友，我眞羡慕，然而我雖不善於扯談（無意義的扯談壓根兒使我討厭）我的眼睛却懂到别人的心，常在沉默中去靜靜描寫一個人。</p>
<p>平日我不大跟鄕紳們合伍，也很少去拜訪他們，有時在街頭邂逅那些跟我有點關係的鄕紳，或是有親友關係，或者是我兒時的敎師，我照例先恭敬去招呼，那個將回答我什麽臉色，或是否理應我，我不想顧它了。</p>
<p>誠然鄕紳總是有鄕紳型的，他們有特具的眼珠子看人；我有時傻想，自家已給他們看做那麽一個樣兒，讓我猜吧！不容猜，好多「事實」，我被他們證明是個不成體統的青年，譬如早幾年我從商店逃出來；跟大敎授們閙勁兒；最近又失業（當然在鄕紳看來，是幹事不成，失業是理所應該的，也許他們全在料我不久的將來要沿街討飯）還有我愈窮還要寫詩；一句話我是分明聽着某鄕紳哼着鼻孔駡過我的：</p>
<p>丨那個小子活該！</p>
<p>我不想爲自家分辯所謂「活該」情形，他們是鄕紳，我不敢開罪那個啦！</p>
<p>自家還有口兒志氣，一個對自己還抱着一點希望的人，不死，當努力下去，在窮困嘲笑裏我偏要爬起來，像路邊一枝小草，被過路人踏着，踏着，但是它偏要向陽光點頭。</p>
<p>最近在某一塲合裏，又有機會跟那些鄕紳們一起會見，他們全把卑視的目光對我，那是當然的囉！在鄕紳們的塲合裏，我是始終被他們冷漢着的。</p>
<p>有幾位鄕紳的「公子」，是我兒時的同學，現在當然是些洋大人手下的大學生了，也儼然有副鄕紳風度，那個我不大服氣兒，他們目下終於還當不起做鄕紳；將來，我難保他們一定做鄕紳，老鄕紳要死去，時代要推前去，鄕紳的金牌也許會退了光彩。</p>
<p>更正：十一月二十二日本刊上所登載臧克家先生「弔」一詩中的第二節第一行「剝開守歲的心的年輪中一的「歲」字，原稿簡寫作「止不」，排字照樣刻起這個字來排進去，校者也没有改正，編者也因爲疏懶，没有在第二天的本刊上加以更正。誰知竟被人誤解，所以不得不趕速聲明一下，以免再引起誤會。</p>

<p>東半球最高之四行二十二層大厦雄姿馥記營造廠承造</p>

<p>— 記者</p>
<p>四行二十二層大厦之高度爲東半球之創作，滬上固未之先見，各營造商均經騐缺乏，而四行儲蓄會，又不欲假手外人，幾經考慮，乃不以標價爲準繩，而以信譽經騐爲依歸，故馥記營造廠，遂得以非最低標價，取得建築權，今該厦已大功告成，巍然獨立，雄視海上矣，此固四行儲蓄會之獨具隻眼，第馥記之奮鬥精神，亦良足多也。記者不惜煩瑣，茲將該廠之概略，載諸報端，以供創業者之研究焉，馥記營造廠，爲陶桂林君獨資創設，陶君南通人，幼卽喪父，家貧廢讀，十二歲，來滬習工藝，頗耐勞苦，不染惡習，且持躬儉約，稍有積資，遂創設是廠。</p>
<p>初時規模甚小，信譽未著，承造之工程不多。先是該廠未經創設之前：陶君服務建築界凡十有五年，刻苦工作，悉心研究：鑒於吾國營造廠組織之不良，建築技術之故步自封，悉使國外建築業得乘機崛起，且有蒸蒸日上之勢；乃嘅然蓄自動組織之念，惟限於財力，行</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>不從志。迨本廠成立，初時資金亦僅五萬規元。得陶君專心一志於經營，如組織管理力求科學化，建築技巧力求美術化同時更注意其堅實耐久。並抱薄利主羲，有時且犧牲利益；故所造工程，如儉德儲蓄會，中華碼頭，實隆醫院等，均能得業主之十分滿意，不三數年，而信譽大著；及民國十七年，廣州總理紀念堂得標建築，營業遂如竿頭日上；而名震遐邇矣。</p>
<p>乃以原廠地址不敷辦公，於民國十八年，設總事務所於九江路，嗣以營業日益發達，職員日見增加，原有所址，不敷應用，乃於十九年遷至四川路企業大樓。</p>
<p>陶君又鑒於建築幹部人員之偏於經騐，而缺乏學識，乃嘅然捐資於其梓里南通呂四創設職業初中。十九年秋開學。專門敎授土木工程建築學科，並闢工塲實習：且以培植貧苦子弟計，取費極廉；故每年負担常費頗巨。二十二年夏，第一屆畢業。陶君一一爲之位置，無向隅者。</p>
<p>且陶君抱負遠大，其營業不斤斤於滬地，若廣州，中山紀念堂，厦門美國領事館，海州營房，河南兵工分廠，青島船塢，浙江貴溪鐵橋，江西中正大橋及勵志社，重慶美豐銀行，淮陰等處導淮船閘工程，均爲該廠所承造，其營業幾至半中國，資本額已陸續增加至四十萬元，其組織管理，亦極爲完善，設總廠於本埠戈頓路，設第一廠於閘北廣林街，第二廠於浦東慶寗寺，設總事務所於四川路，其分廠分事務所，不下數十處，職員凡數百人，得土木科學士者十餘人，其經騐宏富者，更僕難數，設廠僅十年，而營造工程已達一千五百餘萬，現將承造四行經過情形，詳述於下：</p>
<p>鋼骨之裝置丨丨鋼骨裝置，爲該廠承造本工程第一步工作：舉凡棟樑柱頭，内部材料，純係鋼質骨架。其施工方法，用機器吊車二座，輪流調用，以竪立鋼架：每車之起重力爲七噸半，帽釘則用壓氣，此項工程，自民國二十一年八月十六日開始工作。最先竪立兩層鋼架，並將全部水平，測騐準確後，乃陸續向上接做；平均每三日接做一層，惟至第十四層後，因更改圖樣關係，及廠家不能如期供給材料之故，遂致延緩，至二十二年四月中旬始告完竣。</p>
<p>混凝土工程丨丨鋼骨竪立完竣後，卽開始混凝土工程；故是項工程爲該廠第二步工作。其拌和混凝土，均用機器攪拌。其成分按照規定，調和精確，先行乾攪數轉，然後加水，不使過濕；故所做混凝土地板，照説明書規定每平方壓重八十磅，而經設計師及工部局工程師之試騐證明，每平方呎可荷重三百五十餘磅，亦具見本廠遇事認眞之一斑也。</p>
<p>凡鋼架底部，與地基啣接之四週，均灌一一灰漿；其餘部份，爲一二四混凝土。四週平均厚二吋；惟柱頭工字形中間，塡以空心磚，以减少混凝土重量。地板之厚薄，隨横樑徑間遠近而異；約自四吋至五吋半不等，結果二十三呎徑間之地板，施以極重壓力，毫無走動。此項工作率，約十日可以做完一層，計需時六閲月。</p>
<p>隔牆丨丨隔牆爲該工程第三步工作；因須减輕重量，所有内部之隔牆，全用汽泥磚舖砌。舖砌時，先將汽泥磚四週，以水潤濕，然後用一三洋灰膠砌；砌上頂，與混凝土地板，或樑柱接縫處，均用鋼楔塡塞，使牆身穩固，不易動搖。牆面粉一三洋灰膠泥一層，以護汽磚，使不致因氣候之變遷而有伸縮。洋灰膠泥外，則用甘蔗板以隔絶音浪：板上則粉蔴絲灰，並粉石膏一層，用取平滑，而美觀瞻。</p>

<p>平頂丨丨此項工程，因各層裝置需要之不同，其做法亦因此而異；第一二三及十四層等處，懸鋼絲綱花平頂，其式樣可爲滬上之首創。其他平頂，混凝土地板，下面粉蔴絲灰一層，並粉石膏一層，第十三層之平頂，因關係通風及各項管子，乃於所懸鋼絲網上，粉一層一三灰沙，然後再粉以蔴絲灰及石膏。是項工程，因面積過大，且裝修精緻，施工頗屬不易：其花樣繁複，觀瞻美麗，不獨爲上海所罕覯，亦亞東所創見也丨</p>

<h3 id="e2">A New Approach Decided for Receiving Malanyu <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Chai Shan Yiwu Goes to Changchun to Report Then to Ping</p>
<p>The War Zone Clearance Committee Will Meet Today</p>
<p>To Concentrate Opinions and Discuss Various Issues</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Malanyu reception issue has resurfaced. The War Zone Clearance Committee has negotiated with the Japanese side, and a new approach has been decided. The head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan, Yiwu, and Chai Shan Jian Dailang have gone to Changchun to report to the Kwantung Army. The reception date can be determined after their return. The Japanese troops stationed in Malanyu and the puppet troops of the Eastern Mausoleums will gradually withdraw after our reception. The newly formed Special Police Team of the War Zone will enter Luandong, and the old Security Team will be transferred to the mountains for training. This is also being negotiated by the War Zone Clearance Committee. This time, Yiwu and Chai Shan went to Changchun to jointly request instructions from the military headquarters, hoping to resolve the Malanyu issue at the same time. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The War Zone Clearance Committee will hold regular meetings for three days starting from the 1st. The 2nd is Sunday and will be a day off. All issues within the War Zone that need to be cleared will be thoroughly studied in the regular meetings and cleared in order. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The War Zone Clearance Committee held a meeting yesterday. Because the standing committee members Li Zeyi and Yin Tong were not in Ping, it was changed to a discussion meeting. Now that Li Zeyi has returned to Ping, Yin Tong will also rush back. The committee is scheduled to meet on the 1st, take a break on Sunday the 2nd, and continue to meet on the 3rd and 4th to discuss issues related to the War Zone, concentrate the opinions of the various committee members, and seek a proper solution. Yin Rugeng said that the reception date for Malanyu has not yet been set. The bandits within the Jiji District have been suppressed. The issue of abolishing bureaus and merging departments will be implemented by the Hebei Provincial Government on New Year's Day next year. However, it has not yet been officially received whether the counties in the War Zone will implement it at the same time. He will recently contact Yu Xuezhong to discuss everything. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming said that the recent situation in the Xifeng and Tanglanyuyu areas is very good, and the bandit atmosphere is relatively calm. The new director of the puppet National Defense Police stationed outside Gubeikou, Naito Sanro, has taken office a few days ago. The establishment of a Zazhi Bureau in Jianchangying has been approved by the Provincial Government, and the candidates for the two bureau chiefs have also been internally determined. Preparations are underway and it will be established soon. He will not stay in Ping for long and will return to Tang after the War Zone Clearance Committee meeting. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military officer Chai Shan recently went to Changchun with Yiwu, the head of the Japanese Kwantung Army's Special Service Agency stationed in Yuguan, to attend the Kwantung Army meeting. It has now concluded and will return to Ping on the 1st. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Issue of Dividing the Ping Municipality and Hebei Province is Temporarily Shelved <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Huang Zupei has left Ping</p>
<p>Yuan Liang Accompanies him to Beijing</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yuan Liang, accompanied by Huang Zupei, Chief of the General Affairs Department of the Interior, and Section Chief Wu Shizhong, took the Shanghai-Ping train to Beijing this afternoon. Yuan said that he was going to Beijing to negotiate funding for the construction of the Ping Municipality tourist area. He will stay in Beijing for about five or six days or ten days, uncertain. After the negotiations are settled, he will return to Ping to start processing. He will also report everything about the Ping Municipality's municipal administration to the Interior. Regarding the issue of boundary division, he is carrying out the Central Government's instructions to negotiate with the Hebei Provincial Government. Huang said that he and Section Chief Wu came to Ping to gather the specific discussions on the boundary division issue from both the province and the municipality. Because the Hebei Provincial Government is in the midst of reorganization, the representatives have not yet been sent, so this matter has been temporarily shelved. He will return to Beijing this time to request instructions from the Interior and will come to Ping again in a week to convene the provincial and municipal sides to negotiate and report the handling situation. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Central Government believes that the issue of dividing Hebei and Ping is complex. After receiving the reasons presented by the Hebei Provincial Government, it will be submitted to the military and political and interior ministries for review and decision. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Huang Zupei and Wu Shizhong, the commissioners sent by the Interior to investigate the boundary division between Hebei and Ping, are scheduled to leave Ping on the evening of the 30th and return south to report the investigation situation to the Interior. Shu Ziyan and others, more than ten representatives from Daxing and Suping counties, arrived in Tianjin this afternoon, carrying petitions, opposing the merger of the two counties into the Ping Municipality, and appealing to the Provincial Government. The Provincial Government has accepted the original petition. The representatives plan to invite the press in Tianjin to seek public opinion support. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong talked about the division between Hebei Province and Ping Municipality. The province still adheres to its consistent position and makes no insistence. However, it will report the reasons for the inconvenience to the Central Government for review and instructions. According to the opinions proposed by the province and the delineated municipal boundaries, except for the unallocated Dalitangshan, Xiaotangshan and Miaofengshan, the rest are allocated according to the needs of the municipality. Even if the municipality insists on including Dalitangshan, Xiaotangshan, and Miaofengshan, it is not impossible, but it is not appropriate to expand a week's territory with Dalitangshan, Xiaotangshan, and Miaofengshan as the center. The area of ​​Ping Municipality is now 2,340 square miles. If the provincial boundary defense reaches more than 3,000 square miles, there is no need to worry about it being small. In addition to sending a telegram to the Central Government stating the reasons, the province plans to submit another article detailing the opinions on boundary division and urban expansion, which is currently being drafted and will be issued soon. This is not a dispute between officials and individuals, but a plan for administrative convenience or not. Individuals dare not have selfish intentions. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yuan Liang, before leaving, ordered Secretary-General Chen Baoshu to act on his behalf. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of expanding the Ping Municipality has resulted in a deadlock due to the opposition of the Hebei Provincial Government. Huang Zupei and other commissioners sent by the Interior have telegraphed from Ping to Beijing, reporting on the process. The Interior has forwarded it to the Executive Yuan, and the Executive Yuan is still studying it. Once approved, it will be ordered to the Ping and Hebei authorities for processing.

<p>Stating the Working Outline of the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee</p>
<p>Hoping the Whole Country Cooperates to Promote the National Spirit</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang and Chairman Chiang sent a joint telegram on the 30th to protect antiquities. The original telegram reads: "To all departments, ministries, and commissions of the Central Government, the Beiping Military and Political Branch Committees, the Pacification Commissioners of the provinces, the Provincial Governments, the Municipal Governments, all army, division, brigade, and regimental commanders, all universities and schools, and all academic organizations: As the saying goes, by reviewing the old, we can understand the new, and by inheriting from the past, we can usher in the future. The development of a nation and the progress of its culture are invariably based on the traces of its evolution. By observing and emulating, we can achieve excellence day by day. Our country, with its grand and extensive history of five thousand years, has inherited the legacy of our ancestors. All of these things embody the spirit of our predecessors and can either contribute to academic exploration or benefit artistic improvement. By reflecting on the models set by our predecessors, we must recognize this inherent culture if we wish to promote it, and we must recognize this national history if we wish to revive the nation. There is no doubt about this. The government believes that the destruction of national antiquities in recent years has caused a significant loss to the national spirit. In order to comprehensively manage and preserve them, the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee has been established. The Executive Yuan has appointed Li Ji, Ye Gongchao, Huang Wenbi, Fu Sinian, Zhu Xizu, Jiang Fuchong, Dong Zuobin, Teng Gu, Shu Chushi, Fu Rulin, Lu Xirong, Ma Heng, Xu Bingchang, etc. as members. The committee was established on July 12 of this year, and its working outline includes approximately ten points: 1. For established legal preservation institutions, urge them to improve and complete their preservation methods. 2. For antiquities or historical sites not under government preservation, cooperate with local governments to protect and repair them. 3. Approve or reject applications for excavation from academic institutions and provide appropriate assistance and supervision. 4. Impose severe sanctions on private excavation and illegal sale by unscrupulous merchants and local bullies. 5. Protect antiquities in private collections and conduct thorough investigation and registration of important items. 6. After newly discovered antiquities in various localities are assessed by the committee for their value, determine the preservation institution. 7. Assign local governments the responsibility of protecting antiquities and historical sites related to local areas. 8. Antiquities related to academic culture will be allocated by the committee to central cultural and academic institutions for research and study. 9. Register all other discovered antiquities and historical sites and properly plan preservation methods. 10. Strictly supervise the excavation of unearths antiquities. The above ten points provide a general outline. As the committee is the legally designated sole governing body for the preservation of national antiquities, all previous preservation bodies established by the central or local governments without legal authorization should be abolished or merged to clarify the system. However, this matter is of great importance, and while the committee holds the key and balance, it also hopes that all institutions, armies, universities, and academic organizations will understand this intention and cooperate in its implementation. It is imperative to order subordinates to earnestly implement the promulgated Antiquities Preservation Law and its implementing regulations without any negligence, so that culture may flourish, benefit the nation, and provide a reference for the rise and fall of the nation. There is great hope for this." Signed by Wang, President of the Executive Yuan, and Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission (30th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Antiquities Preservation Committee, in order to investigate historical sites and antiquities in Nanjing, convened representatives from six institutions, including the Nanjing Municipal Government and the Academia Sinica, at the Ministry of Interior at 2 p.m. on the 30th to discuss the investigation methods.

<h3 id="e17">Opening of the National Vocational Labor Exhibition Ting <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>On April 5th of this year, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities to hold a National Vocational School and Primary and Secondary School Labor Course Achievement Exhibition in Beijing during the Double Tenth Festival of this year, so as to compare and improve. Later, due to insufficient preparation, it was postponed to today's opening. We dare to congratulate the organizers and would like to take this opportunity to put forward a few points of significance to inform the exhibition visitors.</p>
<p>(1) Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has repeatedly declared that the facilities of education at all levels should focus on production, practicality, and improving social and economic life. General education experts are also shouting loudly. (1) It is necessary to cultivate children's spirit of labor, stimulate creative thinking, cultivate interest in production, and respect the attitude of labor. It is necessary to promote production education. (2) Only education centered on production is vocational education. We want to know how the effect of promoting production education has been in recent years. Although it is impossible to get a "full picture" from this exhibition, at a minimum, it is possible to obtain some concrete evidence. In other words, vocational schools must be centered on production. In addition to the fact that the achievements of the agricultural and commercial subjects are more difficult to be publicly displayed in the exhibition, the display of handicrafts of all mechanical, electrical, civil, chemical, and other industrial arts subjects can certainly be regarded as a reflection of whether the national vocational schools meet the ideal of production. As for the labor products of primary and secondary schools, although they only include a part of the production education that focuses on on-site operation, it is not difficult to get a glimpse of the achievements of production education in primary and secondary schools in China.</p>
<p>(2) What is seen in today's exhibition, whether it is the product of a vocational school or the product of a labor course in a primary or secondary school, is always the "crystallization of the unity of spirit and flesh" of the students of each school. But we must not be too biased towards the utilitarian point of view to criticize. It is said that there are many things in it, which can not be toys or utensils. Therefore, all the values ​​contained in them are erased. It should be understood that the student achievement exhibition cannot be compared with the Panama Exposition or the Chicago Exhibition. Someone once said that production education should not focus too much on the results of production, but should focus on the results of education. This has a unique insight. That is, the basic purpose of labor education is nothing more than enabling students to acquire knowledge from behavior and change the mentality of scholars who have always looked down on labor. If these two points can be done, it is not very important whether the products are excellent or not.</p>
<p>(3) Among the products of vocational schools. We should pay attention to how many are in line with the environment and raw material supply conditions of the school's location. According to our investigation, the location of agricultural schools in China is not necessarily the center of agricultural business. Industrial and craft schools often focus on modern European and American crafts, neglecting the inherent crafts of the local area. In this exhibition, it is not difficult to see this malpractice. If the malpractice is seen, it can be used as a reference for on-site correction. Furthermore, the industrial and commercial circles in major cities along the southeastern coast have always been unusually isolated from the interior. Now that there is this opportunity, it is possible to communicate with each other and help each other. Then vocational education can be promoted and developed.</p>
<p>(4) The scope of labor education in primary and secondary schools is very broad. Such as sweeping the floor, wiping the table, planting flowers, planting trees, keeping school supplies, washing clothes, receiving guests, practicing firefighting, etc. are all included. We should not regard the activity of making labor products as the entire activity of labor education. People who visit this exhibition, if they only judge the success or failure of the school's labor education based on the merits of a school's labor products, it is inevitable that there will be a suspicion of arbitrary judgment. And the authorities of each school, if they have a mentality of worrying about gains and losses before participating in the exhibition, and focus on the manufacture of labor products while ignoring other activities, they have also misunderstood the true meaning of labor education. We feel that the mission of this exhibition is important and dare not but point this out as well.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Zhao Lianke, a wealthy household in Zhangdabao, 45 miles southwest of Daming, has a building with a very rich underground cellar. To prevent theft by bandits, bombs were buried. A few days ago, a long-term worker accidentally triggered the explosion while fetching things, causing a four-zhang high building to be completely blown up. Six women upstairs were killed in the explosion, and the contents of the cellar were blown all over the ground. The villagers scrambled to pick them up. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Tangshan is expanding into a municipality and being designated as an industrial zone. According to a responsible official, this is not the case. Someone once proposed that Yuguan and Qinhuangdao be merged into a municipality, and Gubeikou and Tangshan be upgraded to municipalities. Due to various factors, I believe there is no need to establish a municipality and have already refused. The establishment of a municipality in Tangshan should be the ideal of a group of people. In fact, the population of the area is very small, and it meets very few conditions for opening a municipality. Therefore, there is no need to consider it. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Bomb Thrown at Japanese Residences</p>
<p>Phoenix, Arizona - Anti-Japanese actions in the Salt River Valley of Arizona resumed today. American farmers threw bombs at Japanese homes in several locations. The local court had previously ruled that Japanese people could not farm in the state. However, an official of the Japanese Association stated that all the houses bombed belonged to American citizens of Japanese origin. Fortunately, no one was injured today. Two bombs were thrown last night in Glendale, partially destroying two residences. This morning, protesters returned to the city and threw bombs, destroying a Japanese platform and water pipes. Another bomb was thrown at the home of the president of the Japanese Association, who is also an American citizen. The authorities are deeply concerned that this demonstration may be the beginning of a long-term dispute between American and Japanese residents in the state, as Americans claim that their land is gradually being controlled by the Japanese. Although government and diplomatic authorities have repeatedly tried to prevent this demonstration, the living standards of American and Japanese residents are vastly different, making it difficult for American farmers to compete with the Japanese. They accuse the Japanese of purchasing land in violation of state law. Recently, Judge Phelps ruled that a Japanese man named Tanaka could not farm in the state forever. There are more than twenty other cases of the same nature, all brought by the state government. (29th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Senior Officials Lean Towards a Large Navy</p>
<p>Resolutely Refusing to Concede on the Ratio System</p>
<p>Japan's Ambitions Remain Unclear</p>
<p>(Washington) The government is certain that the representative sent by Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota has not made any new statements regarding Japan's naval policy at the London Naval Conference, nor has he put forward anything that would create hope for the London Conference. Officials are truly unable to understand Japan's motives. Although the great powers clearly expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's occupation of Shanghai and Manchuria, they did not resist. Now, it is unknown on what basis Japan is raising issues of national defense security and non-aggression in the Far East. Therefore, government and private observers now believe that Japan's true intentions have not yet been revealed. Informed sources now believe that the United States will take a firm and unyielding stance, insisting on maintaining the status quo. It is not difficult to expose Japan's ambitions at the time of urging Japan to abolish the Washington Treaty. (29th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) If Japan continues to go its own way on the naval issue, then the U.S.-Japan naval arms race is now inevitable. Support for this policy originally came from senior officials of the Navy Department and naval enthusiasts, and has now rapidly spread to senior levels of the government. They most desire to establish an arms reduction treaty based on the existing 5:5:3 ratio. Senior government officials and close advisors to President Roosevelt, who were initially unwilling to accept the proposal for a large navy, have now also come to believe that the United States should build five warships for every three built by Japan, and believe that the current naval ratio is very fair, so they insist on not taking a step back. People here are gradually believing that Japan can abolish the treaty and add warships at will, but the speed and quality of American shipbuilding will certainly surpass it. It is likely that Japan will announce the abolition of the treaty sometime between December 10th and 20th, just two weeks before the opening of the U.S. Congress. At that time, Japan's actions will be deeply ingrained in the public mind, so the Navy Department may immediately request appropriations to quickly build 78 warships. Once this number is completed, the United States will be able to complete the strength permitted by the treaty. The 78 ships include one aircraft carrier, two light cruisers, 51 destroyers, and 24 submarines. Although the last Congress has passed the Vinson-Trammell Act to build 74 ships, the appropriations have not yet been paid, because at that time it was still hoped that the London arms reduction talks could reduce naval armaments.

<p>British and Japanese Experts Discuss Technical Issues</p>
<p>(London) Quantitative arms reduction has reached a stalemate and there is no need to discuss it further. Therefore, British and Japanese technicians have begun to study qualitative arms reduction and the issue of future warship construction restrictions. After consultations between British and Japanese representatives yesterday, it was decided that Japanese representative Rear Admiral Yamamoto would meet with British technical experts today, and British Foreign Secretary Simon would meet with U.S. representative Davis. According to reliable sources, the British government hopes that Japan can present concrete figures at this meeting, but it is reported that Rear Admiral Yamamoto has decided that unless Japanese naval equality is recognized, he will not present any figures. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The naval conference talks have been temporarily suspended due to the Duke of Kent's wedding. They will resume tomorrow. U.S. representative Norman Davis will go to the Foreign Office, where Foreign Secretary Simon will inform Davis of the results of Tuesday's meeting between the British representatives and Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira and Chief Specialist Yamamoto. It is generally believed that Japanese representative Rear Admiral Yamamoto will go to the Admiralty tomorrow morning to submit Japan's detailed technical response to the British compromise proposal to the British naval authorities. According to Japan's intention, it wants to prove that the British compromise proposal is not incompatible with Japan's main demands. This is what is generally known. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Japanese representative Yamamoto and British Chief of Naval Staff Chatfield will meet on the morning of the 30th at 11:00 a.m. in their personal capacities to freely exchange views.

<p>(London) The British and American representatives agreed yesterday to hold a meeting this morning, but the British delegation has notified that the meeting will be postponed. Foreign Secretary Simon excused himself by saying that he needed to prepare for his campaign speech to be delivered tonight, so he would not be able to meet with U.S. Chief Representative Taft this morning. However, American sources believe that Simon's reason is an excuse, because Naval Minister Monsell met with Japanese Chief Specialist Yamamoto this morning. The United Kingdom actually wants to wait for the results of Monsell's talks with Yamamoto before consulting with the American delegation. (30th Havas)</p>

<p>Japan Should First Show Sincerity</p>
<p>(London) Ramsay MacDonald, the white-haired leader of the Labour Party in the House of Commons, advocated that China and Japan should seek reconciliation, saying that he was still indignant about Japan's breach of contract and infringement on the territory of neighboring countries. However, if he were in China's position, he would be willing to make peace with Japan. MacDonald also said that he knew Japan needed development and Manchuria's resources, but this could be obtained peacefully. There is no reason to resort to force. International security cannot be achieved by violence. This goal can be achieved through mutual assistance and friendship. China and Japan should be able to compromise, and each can make the most of its strengths to seek common prosperity. However, it is first necessary to eliminate the fallacy that might makes right and recognize the truth of mutual assistance and justice. The world is now expecting a country to rise up and accept this doctrine, and the results will be very satisfactory. If one country advocates it, other countries will be able to follow suit. The Japanese now have an opportunity that they cannot afford to miss. Why don't the Japanese tell the United Kingdom and the United States directly to clear the warships from the Pacific Ocean, making it like the lakes between the United States and Canada? If so, Japan will be able to obtain China's peaceful understanding. If Japan resolutely takes this step, Japan's power will not be hindered. I firmly believe that China will very much welcome the Japanese to help them with their peaceful development, no less than they welcome European and American scientists, etc. (30th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Hess to Paris Soon as Special Envoy</p>
<p>A New Beginning for the Disarmament Problem?</p>
<p>Essen, Germany - There are rumors that Hess, a confidant of Hitler and currently a cabinet minister without portfolio, will soon go to Paris. The Völkischer Beobachter, a newspaper affiliated with Aviation Minister Göring, received news from Berlin confirming the rumor. Hess's trip to Paris is to observe whether there is any possibility of a compromise between France and Germany. Riebenntrop, who previously traveled to various countries for Hitler on the issue of disarmament, will accompany him. Hess's trip is in the capacity of a special envoy. The German News Agency officially declared that responsible parties are unaware of this plan, but did not deny it. It is rumored that Ribbentrop has now arrived in Paris to prepare for Hess to contact various French dignitaries. Hitler himself decided to send a special envoy to France this time. Hitler wants his confidants to deal directly with France on this new policy, rather than having the Foreign Ministry take active responsibility. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The actions of Germany's Ribbentrop on the issue of disarmament continue to arouse speculation among people here. Although Herr Ribbentrop's recent visits to London and now to Paris are nominally private, people here believe that his work behind the scenes must be more important than what the authorities have announced. As for Herr Ribbentrop's current visit to Paris, it is said to be because it is expected that the French Chamber of Deputies will debate the issue of armaments, and the debate on German armaments in the British House of Commons earlier this week is generally regarded as the beginning of a new situation in armaments. Several parties now believe that Germany has made preparations for new negotiations on the issue of armaments, but everyone knows that it is difficult to achieve anything without the cooperation of the French government.

<p>(London) The Cabinet held a meeting this morning. It is reported that the main issues discussed were two: one was the issue of German rearmament, and the other was Yugoslavia's application to the League of Nations Council regarding the assassination in Marseilles. Regarding the issue of German rearmament, since Privy Seal Lord Baldwin's speech in the House of Commons on Wednesday, it seems that talks between the United Kingdom and Germany may be triggered. However, the British government has now decided not to initiate it from the British side. Since the British government has already made a declaration, the answer lies with Germany. It is generally believed that formal talks between the United Kingdom and Germany on the aftermath of German rearmament will have to wait until the Saar issue is resolved. However, during this period, mutual contact between the foreign ministries of various countries will still be possible. (30th Havas Telegram)</p>

The Parisian newspapers all regretted this discussion, saying that the British Cabinet is now trying its best to please everyone, and its hesitation may repeat the mistakes of 1914 and fail to contribute to peace. German newspapers were very excited about this debate, saying that this move is tantamount to tacitly approving Germany's rearmament.

In addition, whether the Marseilles assassination case should be discussed immediately as requested by Hungary, or postponed until mid-January next year for handling, will also be decided by this extraordinary meeting. The extraordinary session was originally scheduled to be held on the 21st of this month, but because the Saar issue's committee of three has not completed its work in Rome, it has been changed to the beginning of next month.

<p>Causing Concern in the Holy See</p>
<p>Mexico - The Mexican government has been locked in a politicoreligious conflict ever since the Mexican president promulgated an anti-Catholic decree a few months ago. The situation is now escalating. Local authorities in Juchitlán, Chiapas, planned to move some sacred objects to the church today, leading to a conflict with Catholics. Fearless of firearms, the Catholics resisted vehemently for a long time. The police then opened fire on orders, killing four people and wounding seventeen on the spot. The Catholics had no choice but to retreat. According to news from Rome, the news of the politicoreligious conflict in Mexico has caused great concern in the Roman Curia. The cause of the conflict seems to have started a year ago, when a number of Mexican Catholics went to Rome to celebrate the Holy Year. The authorities were extremely dissatisfied with this move, and therefore took steps to eliminate Catholicism. Two months ago, the Supreme Court ruled that all private houses used for religious services should be nationalized. At the same time, the Mexican president also ordered the Minister of Justice to prosecute all Catholics who were involved in conspiracies to overthrow the government. Since then, hundreds of Catholic churches have been closed throughout the country. Those that have not been closed are now occupied by soldiers. Priests who dare to celebrate Mass are all imprisoned. The judiciary is currently investigating the case of Catholic conspiracy to rebel, and it is feared that the result will be the closure of all churches in Mexico, and all domestic priests will be expelled from the country. The two representatives of the Holy See in Mexico are now living in the United States. The Mexican authorities are preventing them from returning, and border inspections are very strict. An order has been issued that if the two archbishops cross the border, they should be immediately handed over to the court and charged with sedition. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e40">The Puppet Regime Implements a Local System by Overthrowing Koreans and Installing Japanese <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Dividing All of Manchuria into Eleven Provinces</p>
<p>Administrative Power in the Hands of the Japanese</p>
<p>And Adding a Mongolian Affairs Department, Revealing Ambitions</p>
<p>(Changchun) On the occasion of implementing the imperial system, the "Manchukuo Government" intends to establish a new local system on December 1st. This is the same as Japan's Meiji Restoration, which implemented the abolition of the feudal domains and established prefectures, and reformed the local system in a landmark undertaking. The new administrative division of "Manchukuo" will, from today, be divided into Fengtian, Jilin, Binjiang, Longjiang, Heihe, Sanjiang, Jian Island, Andong, Jinzhou, and Rehe provinces, for a total of ten provinces. Adding the original Xing'an Province, there are eleven provinces. The new provincial governors and all police and general affairs section chiefs have been completely appointed. As for the organization and powers of the new local system, the main points of its reform are roughly as follows: (1) The governing agencies and heads of the new administrative district system will still be called "Provincial Offices" and "Provincial Governors" as before; (2) The organization of the new Provincial Offices will not be subject to drastic changes, and their agencies will be adapted to the circumstances of each locality; (3) Seek mutual liaison between the central and local governments to ensure that local conditions are reported to the higher levels; (4) Seek control between the departments in the Provincial Offices and add convenient organizations; (5) Revise the relationship of subordination to the central government to facilitate the liaison and control of affairs; (6) In view of the experiences since the founding of the country and the progress of the times, clearly demarcate the affairs under the jurisdiction of the central government and the affairs under the jurisdiction of the local administrative organs; (7) Clearly define the powers of the provincial governors so that they can play the role of intermediate organs; (8) The names of the new provinces, the locations of the new offices, and the organization of the Provincial Offices are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) New Province Name Provincial Office</p>
<p>Jilin Province Changchun</p>
<p>Fengtian Province Fengtian</p>
<p>Binjiang Province Harbin</p>
<p>Longjiang Province Qiqihar</p>
<p>Jinzhou Province Jinzhou</p>
<p>Rehe Province Chengde</p>
<p>Andong Province Andong</p>
<p>Jian Island Province Yanji</p>
<p>Heihe Province Heihe</p>
<p>Sanjiang Province Jiamusi</p>
<p>(B) Provincial Office Organization</p>
<p>General Affairs Department Civil Affairs Department Police Department</p>
<p>Education Department Industry Department</p>
<p>However, Sanjiang and Jian Island provinces have removed the Industry Department, and Heihe Province has removed the Industry and Education Departments.</p>
<p>In addition, the newly appointed three provincial governors and section chiefs are as follows: Bao Kang appointed as the Governor of Fengtian Province (specially appointed), Hisanaga Kazuo appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Department, Mitani Kiyoshi appointed as the Chief of the Police Department, Li Mingshu appointed as the Governor of Jilin Province, Miura Rokuro appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Department, Kawauchi Shiro appointed as the Chief of the Police Department, Sun Qichang appointed as the Governor of Longjiang Province, Nagai Shiro appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Department, Kawada Yoshiharu appointed as the Chief of the Police Department, Lü Ronghuan appointed as the Governor of Binjiang Province, Kanai Shoji appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Department, Akazawa Hisaburo appointed as the Chief of the Police Department, Liu Menggeng appointed as the Governor of Rehe Province, Nakano Koitsu appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Department, Kobayashi Yoshinobu appointed as the Chief of the Police Department, Wang Zidong appointed as the Governor of Andong Province, Bekku Hideo appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Department, Lian Xiu appointed as the Chief of the Police Department, Xu Shaoqing appointed as the Governor of Jinzhou Province, Minagawa Toyoji appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Department, Otsubo Yasuhiro appointed as the Chief of the Police Department, Cai Yunsheng appointed as the Governor of Jian Island Province, Togashita Yoshisaburo appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Department, Yoshiharu Hidezo acting as the Chief of the Police Department, Jin Mingshi appointed as the Governor of Sanjiang Province, Tokuguchi Hideo appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Department, Taema Ishinosuke appointed as the Chief of the Police Department, Zhong Yu appointed as the Governor of Heihe Province, Narisawa Naoaki appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Department, and Ozono Nagayoshi appointed as the Chief of the Police Department. In addition, there have been some changes in central officials due to these appointments and removals. Takeuchi Tokuhei has been transferred to the position of Director of the Department of Transportation, Shimizu, the governor of Wakayama Prefecture, has taken over as the Director of the General Affairs Department, and Zhao Pengdi has succeeded Tai Kang as the Vice Minister of Civil Affairs. (30th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) In order to reform the local system, the "Manchurian Government" is breaking ground on improving the central organs and refreshing the personnel of the central departments, especially the General Affairs Office of the State Council. Regarding the improvement of the administrative organs, the name of the former Xing'an General Office will be abolished, and it will be renamed the Department of Mongolian Affairs from tomorrow. Tsimotsetsuk Tupileh, the Director of the General Office, will be appointed as the Minister of the Department of Mongolian Affairs. Under it, there will be four departments: General Affairs, Industry Promotion, Mongolian Police, and Political Affairs. Guan Kuchi Yasunao has been decided to be the Director of the General Affairs Department. As a result, the administrative organization of the central government of "Manchukuo" has traditionally been an eight-ministry, three-institute system, and the new Department of Mongolian Affairs has joined it to become a nine-ministry, three-institute system.

<h3 id="e42">Japanese Diet Opens, Hirota Explains Diplomatic Policy <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Navy Insists on Equality Principle</p>
<p>Gradual Annexation of the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota delivered a speech on foreign policy at the House of Peers on the morning of the 30th, stating, "I have previously had the opportunity to present the foreign policy of the Japanese Empire at the 65th Diet. Although the cabinet has changed since then, I have continued to handle diplomatic cases according to the policies stated at that time. Subsequently, a general overview of Japan's foreign relations reveals that the understanding and recognition of the Japanese Empire's position in East Asia by the major powers has gradually increased. Consequently, relations with European and American countries, as well as the Republic of China, have also been continuously improving. This is something I find deeply gratifying. I will now report on the progress of two or three important issues in the Japanese Empire's diplomacy since the last Diet."</p>
<p>Naval Reduction Policy: "The naval disarmament preparatory negotiations currently being held in London, mainly involving the three major naval powers of Japan, Great Britain, and the United States, are of crucial importance. Therefore, the progress of these negotiations should be closely monitored by the Japanese Empire. The British government, seeking to facilitate the naval disarmament conference, requested that related countries hold individual preparatory negotiations in London. This occurred on May 17th of this year. The Japanese Empire government deemed the holding of the aforementioned preparatory negotiations appropriate and immediately communicated its agreement. As a result, negotiations began in London among the related countries from June 18th. Initially, opinions were exchanged regarding the procedural issues for the formal conference to be convened next year. From October, during the subsequent round of discussions, the three countries of Japan, Great Britain, and the United States engaged in negotiations on the substantive issues of disarmament. During these discussions, the Japanese Empire advocated for the consolidation of national defense, the need to maintain sufficient military strength, and the establishment of the principle of non-threat and non-aggression. Japan has consistently advocated for the rejection of the traditional ratio system and proposed establishing a common maximum limit for military strength among the related countries. Furthermore, to promote the spirit of disarmament, efforts should be made to reduce armaments, thereby alleviating the burden on the people in the future. If an agreement is to be concluded, the aforementioned common limit should be reduced as much as possible, while striving to minimize offensive military forces and enhance defensive military forces, making each country difficult to attack and easy to defend. The Japanese representatives, embodying the aforementioned policy, are working to implement their主張 and continue their efforts to conclude a rational new treaty. The Japanese Empire hopes that Great Britain, the United States, and other related countries will understand the fairness and appropriateness of Japan's主張 and that a new disarmament agreement will be established, thereby promoting world peace. This is our fervent hope. As the progress of the preparatory negotiations cannot be made public at this time, I cannot provide detailed explanations today. I will present it at a later date when an opportunity arises."</p>
<p>Relations with the Puppet State: "Our ally, the 'State of Manchuria,' with its spirit as an independent nation and its sound development, was solemnly proclaimed in the imperial edict when Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. This is a matter of fundamental concern for the Japanese Empire. Since then, the internal and external affairs of that country have made further progress. In March of this year, it established an imperial system, laying the foundation of the nation on a permanent basis, which is deeply gratifying. Therefore, in May of this year, His Majesty the Emperor ordered Prince Chichibu to visit Manchuria to express congratulations. As a result, the relationship between Japan and 'Manchuria' has become even closer, for which we cannot but express our deep gratitude."</p>
<p>Russo-Japanese Relations: "Regarding the relationship between the Japanese Empire and the Soviet Union, since my report to the last Diet, there has been a slight improvement. For example, the North Pacific fisheries have been able to conduct their business in a peaceful manner, which is a cause for celebration in the relations between the two countries. Furthermore, the negotiations for the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which were temporarily stalled in the early spring of this year, were resumed in March. Although encountering difficulties along the way, the Imperial government made every effort to mediate, and as a result, the total price and most of the important conditions for the transfer have been agreed upon by both parties. Currently, only three or four procedural issues remain unresolved. As these matters are complex, their resolution will require some time, but we intend to expedite the process in order to complete the negotiations."</p>
<p>Indo-Japanese Trade: "Next, regarding foreign trade relations, I will explain the progress of the main cases below. The trade negotiations between Japan and British India reached a general agreement on substantive issues between the representatives of both sides in February of this year. However, during the drafting of the treaty, the Indian side raised two or three important principles, causing the negotiations to stall temporarily. On April 19th, the representatives of both sides gradually engaged in informal treaty signing. Subsequently, the British and Japanese governments completed the formal signing of the Indo-Japanese Trade Treaty and its supplementary protocol. After being ratified by both sides, it came into effect on September 14th of this year. Since then, based on the actual results to date, it is known that the implementation of this treaty has been very smooth. Indo-Japanese trade has continued to develop satisfactorily on a large scale, which is a very gratifying phenomenon for both countries."</p>
<p>Dutch-Japanese Conference: "Finally, regarding the Dutch-Japanese conference held in Batavia, the Dutch government, faced with the economic stagnation in the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies and in view of the sharp increase in Japanese exports to the Dutch East Indies, sought to convene a conference in January of this year to address the deficiencies of the current Dutch-Japanese trade treaty with the aim of creating a new agreement for adjustment. This was the reason for the start of the Dutch-Japanese conference. The Japanese delegation and the Dutch East Indies delegation have been discussing various issues for six months. Despite efforts to reach a compromise to conclude the conference, the issues are extremely complex and there are many obstacles. To date, the opinions of both sides have not fully aligned. However, the Japanese Empire government has consistently responded with fair and appropriate 주장. All proposals from the other party that align with the interests of both countries and have the potential for implementation have been fully considered, and we are striving for a compromise. We also hope that the conference can achieve satisfactory results in the near future, so as to enhance the friendly relations between Japan and the Netherlands."</p>
<p>Final Conclusion: "The above are all important cases in the recent diplomacy of the Japanese Empire. In particular, the various cases currently in progress must be brought to a satisfactory conclusion in order to mutually increase intimacy with the related countries and to make a greater contribution to the general international situation. The current internal and external situation is at a critical juncture. The implementation of our country's diplomatic policy cannot succeed without the unity of the nation and the joint cooperation of all sectors. This is what I sincerely hope for."

<h3 id="e43">Okada's Policy Speech <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada delivered a policy speech at the House of Peers today as follows:</p>
<p>"At this time of many difficulties and events both at home and abroad, I have humbly accepted the great responsibility of forming a cabinet. I am filled with utmost trepidation. Although I am of meager talent and strength, I will dedicate myself with sincerity and, with the cooperation of all sectors, strive to enhance the happiness of the people and manifest international justice, in order to repay the sacred trust and meet the expectations of the people. The government's policy outline was stated at the time of the cabinet's formation. From now on, we will only strive to move forward and gradually realize its implementation. Recently, disasters have occurred in various places, and many citizens are facing hardship and poverty. Therefore, relief measures need to be implemented urgently. For this reason, the government must implement effective countermeasures and further study long-term disaster countermeasures. We have included the necessary expenses in the budget and hope for your approval. Regarding rice policies, an investigation committee has been established. The government will await its response and then make efforts to proceed. Regarding the naval arms limitation conference, the government places the highest priority on ensuring national security. To establish the principle of non-threat and non-aggression among related countries and to achieve actual reduction in armaments, we aim for its realization in a fair and appropriate manner. The preparatory negotiations currently underway are being carried out by the Japanese delegation in accordance with this policy."</p>
<p>"Regarding the adjustment of the institutions related to 'Manchuria,' the imperial institutions prior to the Incident are insufficient to cope with the significantly changed situation after the Incident, which is beyond question. Therefore, respecting the independence of 'Manchuria,' considering the special friendly relationship between that country and Japan, and at the same time reforming the institutions in Manchuria, we aim to maintain the unity of administrative affairs related to Manchuria. The government will manage and handle all affairs related to 'Manchuria,' and its institutions have been able to avoid drastic changes, which is sufficient to address the reality of prioritizing public order work. Although there may have been some disputes in the process, which is regrettable, the fundamental purpose has been understood. Therefore, misunderstandings and unfounded fears have been completely dispelled. The budget and laws submitted this time are all urgent and cannot be delayed. We hope for prompt approval."

<h3 id="e44">Takahashi's Financial Speech <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi delivered a financial speech at the House of Representatives today as follows:</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, this year, disasters have been frequent throughout the country. There have been floods in the Hokuriku region, droughts in Kyushu and Shikoku, and cold damage in the Tohoku region. In addition, there have been wind and flood disasters in Korea, causing great losses to local farmers. The overall damage caused by wind and flood disasters in Kansai was also very severe. As a result, the disaster has begun to affect the entire country. The exhaustion and distress of the people in the disaster-stricken areas is unbearable to witness. Furthermore, the decline in egg prices has caused great poverty in sericultural areas. In order to provide relief and recovery to these disaster-stricken areas and to implement various countermeasures, the government has allocated over 211 million yen as temporary expenses in the general account. The majority of this amount will be spent on long-term projects to recover from disasters in the 9th and 10th years of Showa. We plan to continue to spend this amount from the 11th year onwards. Therefore, the supplementary budget submitted this time for the 9th year of Showa is over 70.6 million yen, over 65.1 million yen for the 10th year of Showa, and over 75.4 million yen is planned for the 11th year of Showa and beyond. As for the content of the total amount of temporary expenses, over 116.9 million yen is allocated to the Ministry of Home Affairs for disaster civil engineering expenses, waterworks projects, etc., over 68.3 million yen is allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for various facilities for wind and flood disasters and sericultural areas, etc., over 16.5 million yen is allocated to the Ministry of Education for the construction of primary schools in disaster-stricken areas, etc. In addition, there are over 9.4 million yen for the Ministry of Finance, the Army, the Navy, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Ministry of Communications for the restoration of wind and flood disasters, etc. As for relief facilities for various disasters in the general accounting sector, over 3 million yen is allocated to the special accounting capital account for communication projects, over 1.4 million yen to the business account, over 4.6 million yen to the capital account of railways, and over 10.2 million yen to the Government-General of Korea, all of which are planned to be spent from the 9th year of Showa onwards. Furthermore, the supplementary budget for the 9th year includes 38.9 million yen for the Ministry of Home Affairs, 24 million yen for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and 22 million yen for the Ministry of Education in relation to disasters (in units of 1,000 yen)."</p>
<p>"There are also over 5.6 million yen under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, the Army, the Navy, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Communications. In addition, there are 187,000 yen for the dispatch of representatives to the Dutch-Japanese conference by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and over 60,000 yen for the facilities of the Bureau of Asian Affairs under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. As for the financial resources, apart from over 1.08 million from ordinary revenue, the entire amount will be provided by public bonds. In the special accounting sector, regarding disaster facilities, 70 million yen is allocated to the capital account of communication projects, 1.4 million yen to the business account, 3.1 million yen to the railway capital account, and 4.3 million yen to the Government-General of Korea. The financial resources for these will come from increased revenue from communication projects, surplus from the previous year for railways, and surplus from the previous year for the Government-General of Korea, etc. In addition to the above facilities for disaster-stricken areas, there will also be reductions and exemptions of taxes and extensions of collection periods for disaster victims. In addition, the deposit banks will provide low-interest capital as much as possible to assist in reconstruction. The total amount of these loans is expected to be 200 million yen, with 96 million yen for the 9th year. It is also planned to facilitate smooth access to funds for small and medium-sized businesses through bank loans. Furthermore, the government will strive to provide relief and recovery based on the budget, but the citizens themselves should also take preventive measures to minimize the damage from natural disasters, etc., and make good use of various experiences to turn misfortune into blessing. Finally, I hope for your approval of this budget." (30th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e45">Questioning Begins in Both Houses <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Seiyukai's Yamamoto Criticizes the Government</p>
<p>Blames Lack of Control Among Japanese Officials in China</p>
<p>Demands Early Abolition of Naval Treaty</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives opened at 1:09 PM on the 30th in an atmosphere of extraordinary tension. After speeches by the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister, Yamamoto Teijiro began the first round of questioning, raising the following questions regarding the Prime Minister's policy speech:</p>
<p>"Prime Minister Okada's understanding of parliamentary politics and the necessity of political parties, as he claims to have, is something we cannot acknowledge. In reality, Prime Minister Okada is centered on bureaucrats and is exercising dictatorial politics, which is his true intention."</p>
<p>"Secondly, regarding the issue of institutions stationed in Manchuria, he criticized the government's lack of control, stating that the Prime Minister should bear responsibility for control, etc." He also briefly touched on rural issues, financial issues, diplomatic issues, trade issues, etc., as follows:</p>
<p>"There is still room for opening up new frontiers in trade. If we establish a clear national policy from now on and strive to develop new frontiers, then there is no need to be pessimistic about the future of trade. However, it is regrettable that the government has not established any policies regarding countermeasures for the future of trade."</p>
<p>"Can a bureaucratic cabinet formed by gathering old and new bureaucratic elements without political parties with the backing of the people as a foundation exert the powerful force to overcome national difficulties?"</p>
<p>Yamamoto made these points and then demanded a response from Prime Minister Okada. Thereupon, the Prime Minister rose and replied:</p>
<p>"The claim that I disregard political parties is completely unfounded. I want to demonstrate the reality of parliamentary politics."</p>
<p>Yamamoto was again urged on by members of the Seiyukai, and he once again took the podium. Among his questions, he spoke especially about the arms reduction issue and the China issue as follows:</p>
<p>"The Japanese representatives have boldly proposed military equality and a common restriction method for each country to the representatives of Great Britain and the United States. We should express our respect for these efforts. But I do not know why the government is delaying the notification of the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty. This treaty and the military equality advocated by us are absolutely incompatible, which goes without saying. Therefore, its abolition is the unwavering public will of the entire nation. Moreover, the abolition of this treaty is not to destroy international cooperation, but to carry through our legitimate主張. Therefore, the notification of abolition should have been made before this preparatory conference, or at least before proposing our主張 at the preparatory conference. But I do not know whose consideration or anxiety has led to this delay. As for trying to engage in subtle diplomatic tactics in the company of other countries, etc., it will only cause the related countries to doubt our determination, and it will not bring any benefit to promoting the conference. Regarding this point, I hope that the Prime Minister will give a clear answer."</p>
<p>"Next is the China issue. A foreign policy towards China should have been decided long ago. However, it is said that officials stationed abroad are starting actions at their own discretion with their own policies. To place important foreign policy toward China under such circumstances is simply a lack of control. It concerns diplomatic secrets, and I am deeply afraid of causing offense. Therefore, I am not willing to ask for more detailed questions. But since it has been mentioned, the government should also feel something. Even if we do not want to force an explanation, we hope that the Prime Minister will give a reply on this point." (30th Jiji News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e46">British Subsidies for Shipping <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(London) The government issued a white paper today containing an explanation of the British government's resolution to subsidize British shipping. According to the paper, the total amount of subsidies for ships on scheduled routes shall not exceed £2 million per year. If the average freight rate of such ships exceeds 92% of the freight rate in 1929 during the year the subsidy is implemented, the total amount of the subsidy may be reduced. If circumstances change during the period from January 1, 1935, to December 31, the subsidy may be canceled. The amount of advances for building new ships or renovating cargo ships shall not exceed £10 million. Advances will not be granted after two years from the passage of the necessary legislation. The white paper contains the following important changes from the one published in July: (1) For every ton of new ship built by a shipping company, two tons of old ships must be scrapped. For every ton of old ship renovated, one ton of old ships must be scrapped, which is different from the previous requirement of three tons. (2) Shipping companies may purchase British or foreign ships and scrap them. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Defamation of Character Case Awaits Summons of Defendant for Further Trial</p>
<p>Evidence Confirmed by Yin Qiwen, Who Testified in Court That Old Artifacts Were Stolen and Replaced</p>
<p>(Beijing News) The Forbidden City treasure theft case, after repeated investigations by the court and supervisory organs to collect evidence, was jointly filed on October 13th by Sun Wei, prosecutor of the Jiangning District Court, along with the bribery portion of Yi Peiji's tenure as head of the former Ministry of Agriculture and Mining. The court's criminal division began its first trial in the second criminal court yesterday (the 29th) at 10:00 AM. The defamation of character portion of the case, the plaintiff is Yin Qiwen, the defendants are Yi Peiji, Qin Hangong, Dong Lin, and Zhang Xiyin. At that time, Presiding Judge Xu Bangzhi, along with the court clerk, ascended the bench, and the court clerk summoned the parties to the court, but only the plaintiff Yin Qiwen appeared.</p>
<p>Defamation of Character First, Presiding Judge Xu Bangzhi declared that today's trial is investigatory in nature. Then, he asked the plaintiff his name, origin, age, and occupation. The plaintiff replied, "My surname is Yin, my given name is Qiwen, I am originally from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, residing in Beiping, 34 years old, and currently a clerk at the Forbidden City Museum." (Question) "Why are you suing Yi Peiji, Dong Lin, Qin Hangong, and Zhang Xiyin?" (Answer) "Yi Peiji colluded with Dong Lin, Qin Hangong, and Zhang Xiyin in October of last year to issue writings that damaged my reputation, and published advertisements in newspapers such as the Nanjing Xinmin Jiuguo Daily, fabricating facts and damaging my credibility and reputation." (Question) "What are the main points of the reports?" (Answer) "In the newspapers and in reports approved by the Central Supervisory Committee, the Executive Yuan, and the Judicial Administration Department, they all said that I was enticed by others, receiving monthly subsidies, and overthrowing the director in order to defame my reputation. In addition to publishing in newspapers, they also issued leaflets and pamphlets. All of these I have requested the Procuratorate of your court to investigate." At this point, the presiding judge held up the Xinmin Daily and the leaflets and pamphlets, asking if these were the items being referred to. (Answer) "Yes," and he recited the main points of the newspaper reports. Then, the presiding judge questioned why they wanted to defame his reputation. (Answer) "When Chief Prosecutor Zhu of the Supreme Court heard that Supervisory Committee members Zhou Lisheng, Gao Lu, and others had found evidence of corruption in the Forbidden City, they investigated the case. At that time, because I was one of the Forbidden City Museum staff, they asked me to inquire about the corruption situation. However, because it was my duty, I gave truthful answers, which angered Yi Peiji and others, who then colluded with Dong Lin, Qin Hangong, and Zhang Xiyin to spread writings to defame me." (Question) "Where are the defendants' addresses?" (Answer) "Yi Peiji is hiding in various cities, and his whereabouts are unknown. Qin Hangong has secretly taken his family into hiding. Dong Lin and Zhang Xiyin have been impossible to summon since leaving the Forbidden City." He also requested that the presiding judge uphold the power of the law, not only to protect personal reputation, but also to maintain the dignity of national law. The presiding judge instructed him to report the defendants' addresses to the court so that the summons and arrest warrants could be issued and the case could be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Evidence of Treasure Theft Then, the presiding judge asked Yin Qiwen, since he was one of the witnesses in the Forbidden City corruption case, to provide incidental testimony. Yin Qiwen, at this point, changed from the position of plaintiff to that of witness. The presiding judge then (asked) "In what part of the museum were you a clerk?" (Answer) "The Secretariat. The original Forbidden City Museum organization consisted of one department (General Affairs) and three galleries (Literature, Antiquities, and Books). When Yi Peiji became the director of the museum, in addition to the one department and three galleries, he also established the Secretariat, appointing his relative Li Zongdong as the secretary-general." (Question) "Was the director responsible for the museum affairs?" (Answer) "Because Yi Peiji was also the head of the former Ministry of Agriculture and Mining at that time, Li Zongdong handled all the powers of the Forbidden City." (Question) "What was the situation regarding corruption?" (Answer) "Some of the museum's items were sold at estimated prices, with transactions taking place every Sunday. However, Yi Peiji and Li Zongdong, not on Sundays, would authorize the appraisers at any time and purchase items at any time, which involved some corruption. Furthermore, the prices could be lowered at will. The purchasers, Yi and Li, were mainly buying furs and silks. Furs worth a total of 4,000 yuan were purchased, including more than ten pieces of sable and other furs. However, ordinary purchasers could be given a 20% discount when the value was less than 4,000 yuan. Yi and Li jointly had only 4,000 yuan, but they managed to get a 25% discount." (Question) "Where was the appraisal done?" (Answer) "Inside the museum's board of directors, priced by Li Zijiu. It was not like in a commercial place where appraisals and sales were done casually." (Question) "Is it true that the antiques were stored in the Secretariat without a responsible person to keep the keys?" (Answer) "Important boxes and cabinets were mostly in the Secretariat. The boxes and cabinets were all sealed, but the keys were indeed casually placed on the table. When Prosecutor Zhu went to investigate, he saw this situation and asked a messenger in the Secretariat, 'Are you responsible for the fact that the keys are placed on the table?' From this, it can be seen that they were opened at will." (Question) "What was the situation when the antiques were moved south?" (Answer) "The Secretariat sent people to record the items, but the items packed were randomly listed by Li Zongdong on a list. The list stated where each item was, and they were packed there without following any numbered regulations. Everything was done according to Li's orders. I asked Li what would happen when the items were checked later and the numbers did not match the check report. Li said that in this emergency situation in North China, it was like a fire, so how could we follow the numbered regulations?" (Question) "Some people say that the jewelry was unsealed after being sealed, and that the jewelry was removed from the items. What was the situation?" (Answer) "I did not handle the packing of the jewelry. I heard that after the heavy items were packed, they were placed in a specific location, waiting for the trucks to transport them south. But the jewelry, after being packed, was often moved from place A to place B, moved around at any time, without a fixed location, and often unsealed for inspection. However, the packing of the jewelry was handled by people with higher status, and at least by clerks. I was not on the scene and am not very clear." Having asked these questions, it was already 12 o'clock, and the presiding judge announced a recess and that the court would reconvene and issue summons again. (30th)</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Cause and Effect of the Assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia: Lieshan <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(Yugoslav Communication)</p>
<p>The Balkan Peninsula has always been regarded as the powder keg of Europe. It was not only the fuse of the last World War, which caused unprecedented catastrophe for mankind, but also the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which had already sown the seeds of future wars. In particular, the sound of war preparations has spread throughout the world in recent years, so the actions on the Balkan Peninsula should especially attract people's attention.</p>
<p>The result of the World War made the contradictions between the victorious and defeated countries even more profound. In fact, the Balkan problem itself is also overly complicated. For example, religious issues, minority issues, and political issues of pro-French and pro-German factions. These problems had already become unsolvable troubles before the war. Today, this gap is even more difficult to bridge. Not only does Bulgaria feel the pain of lost land and wants to rejuvenate itself, but Hungary alone has three or four million Hungarians who are separated in Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia due to the lost land, becoming the most serious minority problem in the three countries. Because not only the Hungarians in the country want to restore their past prosperity, but the Hungarians abroad also feel the oppression of others and want to gain freedom and return to their motherland as soon as possible. In addition, Italy wants to intervene in the Danube River basin and the Balkan Peninsula, so it forms a system with Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria to confront the Little Entente. This tense situation has the potential to erupt almost at any time, as long as both sides think it is necessary. Among them, the conflict between Italy and Yugoslavia is particularly intense due to the leadership of the Adriatic Sea.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia was Serbia before the European War. After the European War, with the help of France, it divided a part of the territory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. On December 1, 1918, it established the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The land area and population are about twice as large as the old Serbia. The Croats and Slovenes are of the same race as the Serbians. Before the war, the two belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the war, under the slogan of national self-determination, they were merged into Serbia. Although everyone is of the same race, because they have been separated for too long, after the merger, the opinions of the three races have never been consistent. The so-called party struggle in the parliament is almost a struggle between the races, because everyone has their own ethnic party. On the other hand, the reason why they cannot cooperate is also related to religious beliefs. Serbians still retain the common phenomenon of Slavic people and believe in Greek Orthodox Church, while Croats and Slovenes are influenced by Rome and mostly believe in Catholicism. As a result, this situation became more and more僵, until the winter of 1928, all parties tended to extremes, and the crisis of internal change became more imminent. King Alexander I of Yugoslavia felt that this matter could not be mediated, so he dissolved the parliament by extraordinary means, amended the constitution, and re-promulgated it. In fact, he alone held great power and implemented dictatorship. At the same time, he changed the name of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes to the current name Yugoslavia (Jugoslnvian). 猶哥 means "South", originally meaning that all three races belong to the Southern Slavs, so there should be no distinction between them. As a result of the people's vote on this matter, Alexander I won and secured his power. After the failure, the opposition party, due to being oppressed, mostly fled abroad. The internal political struggle in Yugoslavia came to an end on the surface, but the opposition party was even more dissatisfied, so there was a tendency to take risks. Although Alexander I also worked hard, in principle, all ethnic groups within the borders of Yugoslavia were completely equal, regardless of each other, and in fact, it was indeed implemented, but this still could not eliminate the original estrangement. Yugoslavia is a new country and an agricultural country. Although it has also suffered from the wounds of the European War, it has gained more after the war than expected. Therefore, Yugoslavia's hope today lies in maintaining the status quo, in striving for internal construction, and not hoping for any more disturbances. Therefore, internally, it only seeks stability, and externally, it only seeks not to conflict with others. Yugoslavia would be satisfied. However, the neighboring countries have the opposite view. The Italians are ambitious and want to develop outwards and restore the prestige of the old Roman Empire. The Hungarians are gnashing their teeth at their lost land, and they are indeed licking their wounds and waiting for the opportunity. The Bulgarians are always thinking about their lost territory. This means that Yugoslavia is in a situation of being surrounded on three sides. After the treaty between Italy and Albania was signed, Italy's power extended to the southern border of Yugoslavia. In short, Yugoslavia is in a situation of being surrounded on four sides.</p>
<p>Under this situation, it is natural to be disappointed to talk about peace. Therefore, Yugoslavia signed a military alliance treaty with France in 1927, and further contacted Romania and Czechoslovakia to form the Little Entente, in case of emergency. However, in the end, due to the ambition of the Italians, Yugoslavia always felt uneasy and tried its best to break through the Italian encirclement plan. Therefore, in 1933, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia personally traveled to the Balkan Peninsula for the first time, wandering through Romania, Turkey, Greece, and other countries. After returning home, he signed a Balkan treaty with various countries. Because the Bulgarians always failed to understand Yugoslavia, in October of this year, Alexander I personally went to Bulgaria to discuss cooperation between the two sides. According to reports from all parties, the result of this trip was very good. If this is the case, Yugoslavia can be free from worries about the East in case of war.</p>
<p>After Alexander I returned to Yugoslavia from Bulgaria, he took a warship to France. The most important mission of his trip was naturally the issue between Italy and Yugoslavia. Because France's fear of Germany has increased year by year, it wants to compromise with Italy as much as possible, and the rapprochement between France and Italy must first resolve the contradiction between Italy and Yugoslavia. Therefore, this trip by Alexander I is of great importance to the future of Yugoslavia. But unfortunately, when he arrived in Marseille, he was assassinated less than ten minutes after landing. French Foreign Minister Barthou, who was welcoming him, was also killed in the same car. The murderer was a Bulgarian, a member of the Bulgarian assassination group. However, according to opinions from all parties, this assassination case has nothing to do with Bulgaria, and the most suspected are Italy and Hungary.</p>
<p>According to news from Yugoslav political circles, for many years, Yugoslavia's opposition party members have been used in Italy and Hungary to organize a別働隊, who often enter and leave Yugoslav territory, assassinate important political figures, and prepare for riots. It is said that many times have been uncovered, and the murderer has also confessed various inside stories. This time, the group of murderers entered France from Hungary via Switzerland with fake Czech passports. The weapon used by the murderer was a latest type of machine gun pistol, which belonged to military weapons. Because there is no manufacturer's name on it, if it is not supplied by a national military agency, the murderer cannot buy this weapon alone. Naturally, the details are very bizarre.</p>
<p>Since King Alexander I of Yugoslavia was assassinated, the situation in the Balkans has suddenly shown a very tense situation, and war is almost in danger of breaking out at any time. However, after all, all parties are not fully prepared, and everyone has not yet taken advantage of this opportunity to act. At this time, what is being argued is nothing more than the issue of moral responsibility. The Little Entente held a meeting in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, to push the entire responsibility for this incident onto Italy and Hungary. Then Italy and Hungary will show weakness in world opinion. Conversely, Italy, Hungary, and other countries are trying their best to recognize this incident as an internal political assassination case in Yugoslavia, which has nothing to do with other countries. Everyone is currently fighting a big pen war in this regard. The danger of war has been temporarily avoided. Although, the fundamental conflict not only still exists, but after this incident, it has a tendency to expand further.</p>
<p>After the death of the King of Yugoslavia, the internal affairs of Yugoslavia are temporarily not affected by any major impact. The internal and external policies will probably still follow his past political path. The throne is now inherited by Prince Peter, known as Peter II. Peter II is currently eleven years old, and the power is jointly responsible by three regents until Peter II reaches the age of eighteen. The three regents are Prince Paul, former Minister of Education Stan Koyevic and Dr. Borovkovic.</p>
<p>The coffin of the King of Yugoslavia was transported back from Marseille by the Yugoslav warship. The funeral was held in the capital Belgrade on October 18. On that day, hundreds of thousands of people came from all over the country, especially the farmers of Serbia, whose mourning was touching. Originally, Serbia had been under the rule of Turkey for a long time. The ancestors of Alexander I were originally wealthy farmers of the Serbian race who had gathered people to fight against the Turks. Later, with the help of Imperial Russia, they were able to break away from Turkey and establish a marquisate. The ancestors of Alexander I also gained the throne because of this. Therefore, the relationship between the Yugoslav royal family and the farmers is very different from other countries. This time, the death of Alexander I made the mourning of the Serbian farmers even more悲切, because Yugoslavia has today, from the status of an oppressed nation, striving to become an independent country with a population of 14 million. In the simple minds of ordinary farmers, all of this is the credit of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Alexander I was born on December 17, 1888, and was the fourth son of the late King Peter I. He studied in Geneva in his early years, and later studied the army in Petrograd, the old Russian capital. In 1909, after his elder brother Prince George voluntarily inherited the throne, Alexander I was formally considered the heir. In the Balkan War against the Turks in 1912, he served as the commander-in-chief. His military exploits made him an idol of the general public. When the World War broke out in 1914, Peter I handed over all power to Alexander I to manage, especially the military, which was almost entirely commanded by him alone. On August 16, 1921, after his father passed away, he formally inherited the throne. On June 8, 1922, he married Princess Maria of Romania, and had three sons, namely the current King of Yugoslavia Peter II, Prince Tomislav, who is currently six years old, and Prince Andrew, who is currently five years old. In short, the Yugoslav royal family has a relatively stable foundation in the country, so although in this era of trends, and after Alexander I was assassinated, it is still able to maintain the status quo, which is not an easy thing. The future situation will probably still depend on the development of the Italy-Yugoslavia incident. Because Yugoslavia is an agricultural country with no serious unemployment problem, since the drought has spread all over the world this year, the prices of agricultural products have risen a lot, which has given Yugoslavia a lot of economic help. Therefore, the people of Yugoslavia are bound to be poor, but they are able to support a family. Their food and housing problems can barely be solved. What they lack is only cash. Compared with industrial countries, it is slightly better.</p>

<p>Farmers from Daxing, Wanping, and Changping counties have been preparing for petitions since learning that the three counties would be划入 into the Ping City area due to the expansion of the city boundary. They hope that the three counties will not be划入 into the Ping City area. The reasons are as follows: (1) The people in the county area cannot bear the burden of the people in the city area. (2) All contracts and property successions of the people in the county area are traced back to the Liao and Jin Dynasties, and the籍名 is long-standing. Once the籍名 is changed, disputes will arise. (3) At this time of economic decline in the rural areas, the people in the county area do not need the construction of the city area. These are the main points they hold. They also stated everything to Huang Zupei, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Interior, on the 27th and 28th, and asked him to consider the interests of the people and handle the matter impartially. Huang has agreed to forward it to the internal核　.</p>

<p>Beiping Mayor Yuan Liang stated that the issue of the city boundary expansion was carried out奉命, and he had no prejudice. Yuan did not make any表示 on the objections raised by the Hebei Provincial Government. However, Yuan believes that the boundary demarcation issue and the construction of scenic spots do not produce葛蕂. Therefore, Yuan decided to start the construction of the scenic area plan before there is any concrete progress on the boundary demarcation issue. However, all preparations before the trip need to be reported to the central authorities in person. It was decided to go south tomorrow (30th). Yuan told reporters when he was seeing off Nicaraguan Vice President Espinosa at the station today (29th) that he had two tasks to go to Beijing: (1) Since I came to the north to take office, I have not been to Beijing once, so I plan to go south to report everything and return to my hometown to visit relatives. (2) I am determined to work hard to realize the plan to build a scenic area, but I need to contact many related departments of the central government, and the construction cost is one of them. Regarding the boundary demarcation issue, I only obey the orders of the central government and have no other comments.</p>

<p>Farmers from Da, Wan, and Chang counties entertained the Ping City press at the No. 1 Complete Primary School in Fengtai Town at 10:00 am today (29th). At about 8:00 am, the representatives of the three counties, Fan Renfu, Li Yafeng, Zhang Yuanshun, Yang Wenbo, and Shu Ziyan, waited at the Qianmen East Railway Station. A total of eight reporters arrived. The car departed at 8:45 and arrived at 9:15. At that time, the station was full of representatives from the agricultural, commercial, and industrial sectors and more than 2,000 students, all holding small flags and shouting slogans such as "Welcome to the news reporters who uphold justice." All the shops in the town hung flags to welcome them. After getting off the bus, they were led by representatives to the No. 1 Complete Primary School in Daxing County Hutong. The meeting was held at 10:00 am, and thousands of people participated in the meeting. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense. Wang Dianjia, the representative of the petition, presided over the meeting and reported the significance of the reception, asking the press to uphold justice. Other representatives also spoke one after another, supplementing their opinions. After the meeting, the representatives of each county continued to hold a meeting and decided to send representatives Fan Renfu, Wang Dianjia, Zhang Yuanshun, Li Yafeng, An Ruchang, Cui Yijun, Gao Huating, Shu Ziyan, and Yang Wenbo and other ten people to Tianjin by car at 5:00 pm to visit Hebei Chairman Yu Xuezhong and Minister of Civil Affairs Wei Jian to petition.

<p>Huang Zupei and Wu Shizhong, special commissioners sent by the Ministry of Interior to preside over the boundary demarcation between the province and the city, have exchanged opinions with the authorities in Pingjin several times. As a result, the distance between the views of the two sides is too far, and it is extremely difficult to斡旋. Therefore, they absolutely avoid making statements to the outside world. Huang and others also decided to report the process of this trip to Beijing within days and ask for instructions on everything (29th).</p>

<p>The Tongyi Cocoon Bank in Zhang Village, near Bashi Bridge in the 5th District, was suddenly robbed by more than a dozen armed bandits at 10:00 am on September 8, 21. At that time, one Gao Baojin was captured by the villagers. Later, the侦缉 team of the Public Security Bureau successively captured the fugitives You Jinrong, Xu Gaoqi, Yang Xu, Zhang Xifan, Liu Kunlin, Wei Wenbin and other six people, and sent them to the court for sentencing. However, the bandit leader Ji Shuchun was漏网. Recently, the Public Security Bureau received a secret report that Ji Fan had now sneaked back to his home in Chang'an Bridge, Beixiang. Ge督察員 was ordered to lead the police to the countryside at about 2:00 am the day before yesterday, and arrested Ji Fan at his address, brought him to the Public Security Bureau, and sent him to the county government for prosecution.</p>

<p>Zhang Gushi, an old woman from Liuxia Village, Meili Town, 2nd District, previously killed her prodigal son, Pei Zhang, who was engaged in his proper business and smoked opium, by砍颈裴章with an iron hoe. After the incident was published in the newspaper, the county government immediately filed a complaint and first sent a bailiff to the countryside to investigate. As expected, there was the above-mentioned situation. Zhang Gushi and his wife, Hong, and others were summoned to court. According to the confession of the murderer, Gu Shi, she had two sons, the eldest son, Fuzhang, and the second son, Pei Zhang. The property was divided in the previous year and they lived separately. It was only because Pei Zhang was not engaged in his proper business and专事狂浪 that the family property was dissipated. His wife, Hong, tried to dissuade him to no avail, so she went to Suzhou to work as a helper and still lives in her old home. The day before yesterday, because she訓責 him face to face, unexpectedly Pei Zhang not only did not listen, but also beat me and拆去 the brick house at home to sell it. Because she was angry for a while, she accidentally killed him. When asked of Hong, she said that what her mother-in-law said was true, but she could not help but find the methods a bit too harsh, but I was not at home when the accident happened, so I did not know the details, etc. As a result, the court ordered Hong to post bail, and Zhang Gushi was detained. The next day (28th), Cheng Shengyuan went to the countryside to open the coffin and examine the body before核办 it.</p>

<p>Wang Also Needs to Go to Guangdong Before Sun Returns to Beijing for the Plenary Session</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, and Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by night train from Beijing at 7:20 yesterday morning. They are scheduled to board the French postal ship Atos at 11:00 am today to depart for Hong Kong. In addition to Sun and Wang, those traveling with them include Legislator Fu Bingchang, Secretary Yang Huarui of the National Economic Committee, and Wang's secretary Zhu Shouyong, etc. Sun is scheduled to stay in Hong Kong for two or three days before returning to Shanghai to attend the Fifth Plenary Session. Wang may also need to go to Guangdong. At 9:30 am yesterday, Wang Chonghui drove to Columbia Road to visit Sun and had a long talk until noon. Chen Jitang's representative Yang Dezhao, Shi Ci Liu Weichi, and Li Wei Chen Jianru and others were also present. According to what Sun told visiting reporters yesterday morning, Mr. Wang Liangchou intends to go abroad to return to Europe at the end of this year. He is now taking advantage of the short period of time before going abroad to go south again to solicit opinions from all parties. His only purpose is to seek the sincere unity of the whole country. Chairman Jiang and President Wang both hope to promote the unity of the whole country through peace, especially the unity within the party, which is the first声 of the unity of the whole country. This is the proposition of the central government for the past two years, and it has not changed from beginning to end. I am also going south this time with this intention, to seek the sincere unity of the whole country. As for whether Mr. Hu Zhantang can go north, this still needs to be seen in the future. We certainly hope that Mr. Hu will share the responsibility to achieve the goal of national unity. The central government not only listens to Mr. Hu's opinions, but also to the opinions of people outside the party. All those that are beneficial to the country should be accepted without exception and go all out to do so. Whether I will take the opportunity to go to Guangdong on this trip to Hong Kong depends on whether there is time. I am scheduled to return north before the opening of the Fifth Plenary Session so that I can go to Beijing to attend. I personally have no proposals for the Fifth Plenary Session, but the Central Standing Committee has already prepared proposals. Mr. Wang Liangchou's travels to the north and south are only to exchange opinions from all parties. The central government is now promoting the unity within the party with 12 points of sincerity, and then seeking the unity of the whole country, otherwise it will not be able to establish the country externally and will not be able to build it internally. Chairman Jiang and President Wang's opinions on the current situation have been seen in the telegram on the 27th. This is the expression that those in charge should have. This can dispel the doubts of the outside world and can also see the proposition of the responsible authorities.</p>

<p>Liu Talks – Consulted with Chiang on Methods to Suppress Communist Bandits in Sichuan</p>
<p>He Talks – Disaster Victims Everywhere in Hubei Province, Relief Efforts Underway</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression and Reconstruction in Sichuan, and He Chengjun, Pacification Commissioner of Hubei Province, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:20 AM on the overnight express train from Nanjing. Liu came to have his health checked and treat his diabetes, as well as to visit the site of the January 28th Incident in Shanghai. He accompanied Liu on his trip to Shanghai to visit friends in the Shanghai area, and plans to stay for about three or four days. The details of their arrival in Shanghai are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Liu and He Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>After Liu paid his respects to Chairman Chiang in Nanjing, he originally planned to return to Sichuan immediately to handle military affairs related to the suppression of bandits in Sichuan. However, due to years of handling military affairs, he felt physically exhausted, and his diabetes recurred. He took the opportunity to come to Shanghai to have his health checked. His arrival in Shanghai was rushed, so few people knew about it. Only Yang Hu, Director of the Municipal Security Bureau, and Secretary Wang Zhijing, and others welcomed him at the station. The Municipal Security Bureau also sent a company of security guards to the station to provide security. Liu and He got off the train amidst the welcoming cheers and went to their hotel to rest.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Liu Undergoes Health Examination <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Those who accompanied Liu to Shanghai included Secretary-General Zhang Bigou, Liu's representative in Hankou Qiu Jia, his representative in Shanghai Deng Mingjie, two adjutants, and bodyguards, a total of eight people. After arriving at the hotel, he immediately invited physician Lü Shoubai to examine his health. Then, at his residence, he telegraphed his old friends in Shanghai to meet. At 9:00 AM, he went to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road to have his health checked and treat his diabetes, returning to his residence around 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, Liu went to the city center to visit Mayor Wu and visit various construction projects. He then went to the Wusong forts and other areas of the January 28th Incident to visit the war zone. He visited Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, yesterday afternoon around 5:30 PM, talking for about half an hour before leaving. Yang Hu, Director of the Municipal Security Bureau, hosted a banquet for Liu and He at his private residence on Huanlong Road yesterday at noon, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until around 2:00 PM before dispersing.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Liu's Remarks <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Liu was wearing a gray suit, a thick black wool coat, and glasses on his nose. He was tall and thin, with gray hair. According to Liu, he took the opportunity of his trip to Nanjing to visit Shanghai to treat his diabetes. He will stay in Shanghai for about three days before returning to Nanjing to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang again. He plans to leave Nanjing for Sichuan in a week. The military situation for suppressing the bandits in Sichuan is currently not advancing. He had already consulted with Chairman Chiang in Nanjing on methods of suppression. As soon as he returns to Sichuan, he will order a general attack. The bandits are currently occupying the Tongjiang-Wanyuan county area, with about 60,000 to 70,000 people and 20,000 to 30,000 firearms, making it necessary to mobilize 100,000 troops to encircle and suppress them. Sichuan's finances can usually balance revenue and expenditure, but due to the ongoing period of bandit suppression, military expenses are numerous, resulting in a shortfall. He has also consulted with Finance Minister Kong in Nanjing and a method has been agreed upon: the Ministry of Finance will send personnel to Sichuan to jointly reorganize national taxes. The rumor that Sichuan is issuing public bonds of 70 million yuan is a misunderstanding. As for transporting 10 million taels of silver to Sichuan, it is because Sichuan lacks silver to regulate finance. Regarding construction in Sichuan, there are many plans, but they cannot be carried out due to the ongoing bandit suppression. The important ones include building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and developing sugar production and salt fields. Once the communist bandits are eliminated, we will actively carry them out.</p>

<p>According to He Chengjun, he came to Shanghai to visit friends and will return to Nanjing within three or four days to attend the Fifth Plenary Session on December 10th. Zhang Xueliang has already entered Nanjing from Hubei to attend the meeting. As for the banditry in Hubei Province, after vigorous suppression, the bandit gangs have dispersed. The banditry in the entire province will soon be resolved. However, after being disturbed by bandits, disaster victims are everywhere and many are homeless. The provincial government is currently conducting relief efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Sanbei Company's Taishan Ship Encountered Wind En Route, Did Not Arrive <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Company Sends Telegram to Inquire</p>
<p>No Definite News</p>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Taishan ship departed from Qingdao on November 27th. On the 29th, the Shanghai company did not receive a telegram from the ship. The company was very concerned. Because direct telegram calls went unanswered, they telegraphed the Qingdao branch to inquire about its whereabouts. They subsequently received a reply stating that the Taishan had fully loaded coal and departed from Qingdao, heading for Shanghai. There has been no news since then. This newspaper had already learned about this matter on Thursday afternoon. However, because the company still found it difficult to confirm the facts, it was not disclosed in the newspaper. However, there was indeed a strong wind on the sea on the night of the 27th. Yesterday morning, there was a message stating that the Taishan ship had temporarily stopped to avoid the wind in the Xiaoshanji Bay, 120 nautical miles from Qingdao, and its radio had been destroyed by wind and waves, so it could not report. The reporter went to the company to inquire about the truth. According to people in the company, when the Taishan left Qingdao for Shanghai, the Yutai Xing, another ship in Shanghai, also left Qingdao. They encountered a strong wind en route. Now that the ship has arrived in Shanghai, there is no doubt that the Taishan encountered wind. However, it is widely rumored that the Taishan may have had an accident. Because the matter was serious, the reporter again inquired with the person in charge of the Sanbei Company about the news of the Taishan ship. According to reports, no telegrams had been received in Shanghai since the Taishan left Qingdao, and Shanghai's calls went unanswered. Whether it had an accident or not, the company had not received a factual report to prove it and could not say for sure but was still trying to find out. It is understood that the Taishan ship has a deadweight of 2,261 tons and a net tonnage of 1,420 tons. It was built in 1906. This year, in order to open the Nanhua route, it underwent major repairs in the dock and was thoroughly rebuilt, with passenger seats installed. This time, it was loading coal in Qingdao to come to Shanghai.</p>

<p>To Ease Financial Panic</p>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese Daily News reported that the panic in the financial world is expanding, with the decline of public bonds and stocks and the rise of cotton, silk, and cotton, resulting in fluctuations in the value of currency. As a result, the credit of paper money and cash is gradually diverging. The state of anxiety in the financial world is imminent. The Ministry of Finance and financial operators are doing their best to reverse the crisis. Among them, the negotiation with HSBC to re-import cash from Hong Kong may alleviate the current financial situation. However, HSBC has agreed in principle to the re-import of silver, but on the condition that if it is re-exported in the future, it will be tax-free. The Ministry of Finance believes that China has not yet escaped from the silver standard and does not agree to this condition. It is said that HSBC may not object on the surface.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Recent Situation of the Yellow River Blocking Project <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Yellow River Water Disaster Relief and Work Relief Group has been diligently supervising and expediting the Yellow River blocking project at Changyuan. The group received telegrams yesterday from Liu Bingzhong and Sang Ze, inspectors dispatched by the Bian Office, as well as Hua Deming, Director of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, stating that after the continuous work on guiding levees at Guantai, the river flow has become smoother. As of the 26th, at Longmenkou, the constructed sections include a 53-zhang (approx. 177 meters) long levee at the west station, an 11-zhang (approx. 37 meters) long earthen dam at the east station, and a 14-zhang (approx. 47 meters) long revetment levee. The current water depth is 3.2 meters. Due to the rainy and windy weather today, the water conditions are unstable. The Bian Office sent a telegram instructing that the blocking work be strictly expedited after the weather clears to avoid delays. A reply telegram received later on the 27th indicated that work was still being intensified, with the west dam being extended by 2.5 zhang (approx. 8.3 meters) and the east dam having a 14-zhang (approx. 47 meters) revetment levee added. With such rigorous supervision, it is expected that the river will be blocked and the flow cut off soon. Furthermore, the Yellow River Blocking Project Fund Management Committee, jointly established by the group, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and the Hebei Provincial Government, has been working intensely in Bian since its establishment. The central government's allocated subsidy of 100,000 yuan has already been remitted and stored for safekeeping. However, since the Hebei Province's allocated funds have not yet arrived, Director Kong Xiangrong telegraphed Minister Kong, who in turn telegraphed the Chairman, urging the full allocation of 100,000 yuan as per the original plan, to match the central government's approved 200,000 yuan for the blocking project. Yesterday, a report from the Bian Office indicated that the 100,000 yuan to be allocated by Hebei Province has also been remitted in full, ensuring that the funds are ready and awaiting allocation for construction use. For this Yellow River blocking project, the Guantai Jiugu Road and Da Niezhuang projects are being undertaken simultaneously. Due to the urgency and difficulty of the project, the original budget estimated by the Hebei River Affairs Bureau was over 300,000 yuan. Following approved procedures, the group, together with the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, thoroughly discussed and approved a revised budget of over 197,000 yuan, with detailed explanations provided. However, Director Kong believes that the more shoreline protection that can be done, the more protective force it will provide. He is scheduled to come to Beijing to discuss specific measures with Minister Kong, whereby the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association will issue a letter to Director Kong, who will travel to Henan Province within days to negotiate with the Henan authorities regarding the small water interception dam project within the embankment, previously built by the China International Famine Relief Commission and now damaged. He will request that the Henan Provincial Government allocate funds for its repair, as the completion of this dam is highly beneficial to the local people of Henan. The Henan provincial authorities had originally expressed their willingness to assist, and it is likely that this will become a reality. Moreover, fearing that the cold weather might make it difficult to extract soil and hinder the blocking project, Director Kong inquired about the weather conditions at the construction site during his recent trip to Beijing, which coincided with rainy and windy weather in the city and a drop in temperature. He received a reply telegram from the Bian Office stating that the weather had cleared on the 27th, with the temperature at 48 degrees (Fahrenheit), and 50 degrees (Fahrenheit) on the 28th, with regular inspections being conducted at the site and daily reports being submitted.</p>

<p>Thirty-Four People Have Registered As Of Yesterday</p>
<p>The Tongan Steamship Company's Tongfu Steamer, confirmed to have been lost at sea off the coast of Korea at 5:00 AM on November 2nd, resulted in the loss of all 43 crew members, from the shipowner down. Apart from the shipowner, who was Russian, the rest of the crew were from Ningbo, and most of their families reside in Shanghai. Upon hearing the tragic news, they were overcome with grief. The families appealed to the Ningbo Shanghai Association, which, considering that the deceased were all fellow townsmen, felt obliged to assist. It sent a letter to Zhuo Huimin, the company representative, requesting instructions on handling the aftermath. Meanwhile, organizations such as the Beijun'an Guild Hall, the Maritime Friendship Association, the Maritime Helmsman and Carpenter Mutual Aid Association, and the Yan Ying General Association established the Bereaved Family Relief Committee for the Tongfu Disaster, with Zhou Xinzhang, Chen Songnian, Chen Xiaozhang, Chen Aren, and others as committee members. The committee's office is located on Guoyutang Street in the Nanshi district, handling the registration of the deceased crew members and other matters. Yesterday afternoon, Zhou Xinzhang, Yang Yuesheng, Zhang Lifu, Jiang Pinshun, and four others led over ten family members to the association, bearing a letter requesting continued assistance in handling negotiations. Zhao Kuiyi and Lin Zhitang from the association met with them and agreed to continue pressing the company rigorously. Below is a record of the names and origins of the deceased crew members registered as of yesterday: Yang Yukun (Zhenhai), Yao Zhengtang (Yinxian), Wang Rulian (Zhenhai), Gu Baoling (Yinxian), Li Kangning (Yinxian), Tang Dejin (Yinxian), Li Ali (Zhenhai), Xin Chenghao (Yinxian), Dai Yuelai (Yinxian), Ying Gencai (Yinxian), Jiang Xinkuan (Fenghua), Zhang Ajin (Fenghua), Chen Anwen (Dinghai), Le Minglin (Dinghai), Gu Xiaocheng (Dinghai), Wang Chenggao (Dinghai), Xu Sanquan (Dinghai), Le Deyi (Dinghai), Wang Lixing (Dinghai), Jiang Ading (Dinghai), Hu Huixin (Dinghai), Huang Baorong (Yinxian), Wang Zhixiang (Yinxian), Wang Ashao (Yinxian), Chen Xianglang (Chongming), Lin Abao (Yinxian), Xia Aci (Dinghai), Lin Aweng (Dinghai), Miao Xiaoyan (Yinxian), Xin Baorong (Yinxian), Jiang Fuchao (Fenghua), Tong Yuanli (Dinghai), Chuan Youren (Dinghai), Jiang Caiming (Dinghai).

<h3 id="e136">Special Commissioner Zhang Wuyuan of Henan Province Leaves Shanghai <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Wuyuan, the special commissioner for statistical investigation dispatched by the Henan Provincial Government, came south to investigate statistical affairs. Mr. Zhang and his party completed their official business on the 30th and returned north. According to Mr. Zhang, he was originally ordered to investigate in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, but due to the time constraint, he regrettably could not visit Hangzhou. Regarding the three places visited, he gained very positive impressions. The statistics departments of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the National Government's Bureau of Statistics, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the British and French Concessions can be considered models. With the advancement of science, the effectiveness of statistics is extensive, and its importance is profound. Therefore, strict attention must be paid to the organization's structure, the precision of charts, and the accuracy of numbers, as even the slightest error can lead to significant inaccuracies. The statistics produced by the aforementioned departments have excellent results in all the above aspects. In particular, the authorities of the British and French Concessions employ the latest European and American methods and various statistical instruments, which are worthy of reference for Chinese people. Taking the statistical analysis machine as an example, even with extremely complex occupational statistics, classification using this machine can yield accurate results in the shortest possible time. Other examples can be inferred from this. During his trip south, Mr. Zhang visited various places and learned from others' strengths to correct his own weaknesses, gaining a lot of benefits. After returning to Henan, he will organize and refine the materials collected during this trip, improve the Henan statistical plan, and submit it to the Provincial Chairman for adoption and implementation. He only provided a brief overview based on what he saw and heard and did not dare to make any presumptuous criticisms. He also expressed his gratitude for the sincere hospitality of the municipal government, the concession authorities, and other organizations in this city.</p>

<p>Precious Blood Transfused to Patient</p>
<p>Since President Yen took over the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society, he has hired experts and established specialized departments, and the medical services have been improving daily. Recently, a maternity patient, Mrs. Huang Xu, suffered severely from uterine cancer. After examination, it was determined that a blood transfusion was necessary for any hope of recovery. However, a blood transfusion is related to the health of the blood donor, and it was difficult to find a suitable person for a while. After several discussions, no solution was reached. Mrs. Yen Fu-ching happened to hear about this and believed that doctors should have the spirit of "cutting off a piece of flesh to cure the patient." If it could cure the disease, she was willing to donate her own precious blood to the patient. She went to the hospital and asked the doctors to perform the blood transfusion procedure, which went very well. This spirit of acting bravely for a just cause is truly commendable, and it reflects the spirit of diagnosis and treatment in the hospital.</p>

The construction has now been completed, and the bank will officially move in and start business this morning. In addition to handling various fixed and current deposit accounts, credit lending, bill discounting, remittance collection, and other businesses that a commercial bank should have in its commercial department, the bank has also allocated funds to establish a dedicated savings department, with Deputy Manager Ma Shaoquan concurrently serving as its director. It has created various new savings schemes with excellent procedures. The directors and supervisors bear unlimited liability. Mr. Wang Honglai also serves concurrently as the director of the real estate department, handling the buying and selling of real estate, property rentals, and design drawings at extremely low fees. The rental fees for office space in the bank building are also very low. During the commemorative period, those who open accounts at the bank will receive gold and silver utensils from the Qingyun Silver Shop as gifts in addition to enjoying favorable interest rates.

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, recognizing that the farmers in the disaster-stricken areas of various counties this year are suffering greatly and will inevitably be forced to sell their livestock, drafted measures for cattle loans in order to prevent this from affecting the spring plowing in the coming year. This draft was submitted to the Supervisory Committee for approval and distributed to various branch offices for reference. It has been learned that the Changzhou, Yixing, and other branches have already implemented these measures, and the requests for loans have been very enthusiastic. In Changzhou alone, over 4,000 cattle have been mortgaged, and there are still many applications being received. Cattle mortgage loans in Wuyi County are handled separately at the warehouses in Benniu, Buyiqiao, Dong'an, and Nanshuxia. The mortgaged cattle are branded on their horns but are still returned to the farmers for plowing. The county government issued a notice stating that the cattle cannot be bought or sold before the mortgage is cleared. A guarantee is provided by three or more neighbors, certified by the township office, and a reliable shop is found to guarantee repayment responsibility.</p>

After graduating in medicine in 1933, he interned at St. Lukce's Hospital and Bethlehem Hospital, where he quickly became famous for his steady and rapid surgery skills. As a result, an American female physician, Wilma Stiles, admired him and eventually married him. Dr. Mei is not only skilled in medicine, but he also held various important positions in Chinese student organizations in the United States. He represented China at the International Youth Conference as the president of the Chinese Student Christian Association in the United States. His enthusiastic service is evident. His skills in lecturing, music, and social interaction are also worth mentioning. This summer, Dr. Mei and his wife and son returned to their homeland. He was hired by the Bethel Hospital and performed a caesarean section on a difficult birth, saving both mother and child. He is scheduled to officially open his practice on December 1st. Dr. Mei's skills are a cause for celebration for the future of Chinese medicine.</p>

<p>Donated 25,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Child Welfare Association Hosts a Banquet in Appreciation</p>
<p>The American philanthropist Sanders, 65 years old, came to China during the late Qing Dynasty and has served for over thirty years. In the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), with the consent and assistance of the late Premier and Madam Soong Ching Ling, he established the Puguang Orphanage in Shaoguan, Guangdong, to carry out the work of rescuing children. Initially, the scale was very small, but later, through continuous efforts, he expanded the site to over 400 mu (approx. 26.7 hectares) and built twelve buildings of various sizes. In addition to primary and secondary school courses, there are also planting, animal husbandry, dyeing, and other workshops. There are currently fifteen teachers, doctors, and nannies, as well as over 200 orphans. The results are quite excellent. Recently, the director, seeking greater development, traveled north to Beijing and Shanghai with Zeng Jiucheng, a staff member of the orphanage, to visit Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang, Sun Ke, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Zhengting, Mayor Wu of Shanghai, and other important figures. They received donations of 25,000 yuan and hired Zhu Ziqiao, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Qu Wenliu, Feng Yangshan, Huang Hanzhi, Zhao Jinqing, Guan Jiongzhi, and others as honorary directors of the orphanage. The results of the meetings were very satisfactory. The Shanghai Child Welfare Association believes that Sanders, as a foreigner, has shown such enthusiasm for China's child welfare cause, which is rare and commendable. Therefore, it hosted a banquet at the Da Zhonghua Restaurant on Sichuan Road yesterday at noon to show its appreciation. In addition to Sanders and Zeng Jiucheng, those present included Chen Tiesheng, Deputy Director-General of the Child Welfare Association, Chen Zhengfan, Zhao Jian, and Quan Shaowen, a member of the Beijing Child Welfare Association.

<p>The fundraising rally of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) took place at the National YWCA Association yesterday at 4:00 PM. Yesterday (30th), at 4:00 PM, the closing ceremony was held at the National YWCA Association Building, No. 133 Yuanmingyuan Road in this city. The rally has been ongoing for three weeks since its opening on November 1st. Thanks to the efforts of various teams and the enthusiastic donations of people from all walks of life, the results have been excellent. Over a hundred people attended yesterday's closing ceremony, making it a very lively event. The meeting began at 4:00 PM, with the following agenda: (1) Opening remarks by Mrs. Jin Longzhang (Chairwoman); (2) Piano solo by Ms. Hessler; (3) Speech by Mr. Luo Panhui, Councilor of the Municipal Government (representing Mayor Wu); (4) Speech by Mrs. Wang Ziweng; (5) Report on overall results by Ms. Mei Niuminhua; (6) Report on the names of winning teams and individuals by Ms. Xue Weizengpei; (7) Music; (8) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairwoman's Opening Remarks: Briefly stated that she was very grateful for the strong support and donations from various teams since the opening of the rally. Now that it is time for the closing ceremony, according to the reports from various teams, the ordinary donations amounted to 30,000 yuan, exceeding the goal. The special donations of 30,000 yuan are still actively underway and can be expected to be reached. This success should be attributed to the joint enthusiasm and efforts of Mrs. Kong, Mrs. Wu, the advisors, and the team leaders and members of the rally.</p>
<p>Speech: Mr. Luo Panhui, the Mayor's representative, said in his speech: Today, this city convened a committee for the general donation to the disaster areas, and Mayor Wu was unable to attend this grand ceremony of your association. He instructed me to represent him. I express my sympathy for the work of both the men's and women's YMCAs. The ordinary donations of this fundraising rally have exceeded the goal, which shows that the work of your association has gained the support and trust of people from all walks of life. The YWCA has 16 locations in cities and 4 in rural areas. It is hoped that you can further promote rural work, as the rural population accounts for more than 80% of the national population. The importance of rural undertakings is evident. In the future, if the YWCA can develop in rural areas and establish YWCA organizations in the hinterland of the country, it will adjust the lives and thoughts of rural women, not only contributing to national rejuvenation but also making a great contribution to mankind. (2) Mrs. Wang Ziweng said in her speech: I just came to Shanghai from Guangdong and witnessed the enthusiasm of everyone in fundraising. I am very impressed. Women in Guangzhou are mostly simple and practical, which can be a model for women in other places.

<h3 id="e143">A Policeman Steals a Leather Belt and is Apprehended <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Truth Comes to Light After Discovery</p>
<p>The Policeman is Sentenced to One Year and Two Months in Prison</p>
<p>Tang Qinggui, a worker at the Zhongfu Silk Mill on Hengfeng Road in Zhabei, stole several leather belts worth 300 yuan from the factory at around 5:00 AM on November 25th, intending to take them to the concession to sell them for money. However, he was stopped at the south end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge by Wang Zhiliang, a Chinese policeman No. 2347, and Cai Kunshan, a Chinese policeman No. 390, both stationed at the bridge by the Xinzha Police Station. Seeing Tang acting suspiciously, they arrested him and interrogated him. Tang initially denied it but then confessed that he had stolen them from the Zhongfu Silk Mill and begged for leniency. The two policemen, thinking that no one knew about this matter, had the idea of pocketing the items. They confiscated the leather belts and let Tang go. Tang also thought that he had escaped from the jaws of death, which was a great fortune, so he went back to the factory, preparing to continue working. Unexpectedly, the factory owner, Han Songwen, suspected that Tang had stolen something and reported it to the Public Security Bureau, who sent a detective to arrest and interrogate Tang. Tang knew that there was nothing to hide, so he told the truth. The bureau chief, after verifying the confession, immediately took Tang Qinggui to the Xinzha Police Station to state their intention. The police chief gathered all the Chinese policemen in the station and asked Tang to identify them. Tang immediately identified Wang Zhiliang, policeman No. 2547, and said that there was another policeman who was not present today. The police chief detained policeman Wang and investigated whether policeman Wang was indeed on duty with policeman Cai Kunshan, No. 390, on the night shift at the Wuzhen Road Bridge. However, Cai had not come to the station for roll call and had fled after learning of the situation. All the stolen goods, the leather belts, had also been taken away by policeman Cai. Therefore, policeman Wang was escorted to the First Special Court by the police station on the morning of the 28th, requesting temporary detention for investigation. In addition to denying any collusion in court, the lawyer, Fan Gang, applied for bail for him. Judge Wu ordered Wang Zhiliang to be released on bail, subject to being summoned at any time, with a shop as his guarantor, pending investigation. Yesterday morning, the date for the trial arrived, and Wang also surrendered to the court to await questioning. According to the police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, who stated the case, during the detention period, the police station determined that policeman Wang's previous statement was completely false, and he was in collusion with Cai, who was at large. Therefore, he was formally prosecuted in accordance with Article 172 of the Criminal Law for facilitating escape and Article 376 for receiving stolen goods, and requested a strict investigation. Furthermore, according to the confession of the suspect, Tang Guangui, obtained by the Public Security Bureau, he was stopped by Chinese policeman No. 390 while passing the south end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge that morning, and the leather belts were confiscated. He was released after begging, but Wang was also present at the time and soon left for another place. When questioned, the defendant still equivocated and tried to deny his guilt. After verifying the confession, Judge Wu Tingqi sentenced Wang Zhiliang to one year and two months in prison for jointly facilitating escape. The number of days of detention before the final judgment will be counted at two days for each day of imprisonment. Wang Zhiliang was taken into custody, and Tang Qinggui was taken back by the Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Late Owner of Hua Rongchang Candle Shop's Wives and Concubines Dispute the Inheritance, Leading to Litigation <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Differences of Opinion Between the Parties Make Mediation Impossible</p>
<p>Next to the Hong Temple (i.e., the Bao'an Situ Temple) on Nanjing Road, there are two incense and candle shops, one is Hua Rongchang and the other is Wangchang. The business of these two shops relies entirely on the temple, as the temple's incense is perpetually flourishing. Especially during the new moon and full moon of the lunar calendar, superstitious women flock to the temple, and customers also throng to these two shops, wearing out their thresholds. The owners of both shops have become wealthy. The owner of Hua Rongchang was from Ningbo. In the past, his wife and concubine had litigated in the former Mixed Court over the management of the shop. The owner of Wangchang, Mr. Huang, was also from Ningbo. He had been in the incense and candle business for many years. In addition to the shop next to the Hong Temple, he also had several branch shops. His family was very wealthy. Mr. Huang originally had one wife and one concubine. The wife was named Hua Caiqin. Although the concubine had no children, she had raised a son named Hanqing in his early years, who is now only fifteen years old. Unexpectedly, Mr. Huang died of illness on September 16th of this year. The huge amount of property he left behind was entirely controlled by Hua Caiqin. The concubine is now only thirty-seven years old. Fearing that it would be difficult for the mother and son to maintain their livelihood in the future, she asked the main wife to divide the inheritance. However, Hua Caiqin sternly refused. Although relatives were invited to mediate, it was to no avail. The concubine then, in the name of her adopted son's legal guardian, retained a lawyer to submit a petition to the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District District Court, requesting mediation. However, after the mediation court investigated the matter, it was determined that the claims of the two parties were irreconcilable and a peaceful resolution was impossible. Therefore, the concubine formally sued Hua Caiqin, requesting a judgment ordering the defendant to hand over all the inheritance for legal division. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan of the Civil Division of the First Special District Court held a hearing. The defendant failed to appear in court. The plaintiff's attorney briefly stated the grounds for the lawsuit. Judge Qiao then adjourned the hearing to 2:00 PM on October 6th, ordering the defendant to appear in court for further interrogation.</p>

Regarding the possibility of holding repeat performances in a location near the Northeast District, it has been found that there is no suitable venue that can be rented at a low price. The search is still ongoing.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Bodies from Food Poisoning at Oujia Road Restaurant Sent for Autopsy <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Leftover Food Sent to Government Office</p>
<p>Waiting for Thorough Investigation and Comforting Families</p>
<p>At the Xie Shunxing Restaurant at 59 Oujia Road in Hongkou, ten diners suffered food poisoning after eating the previous day (the 28th), and died one after another, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. After the local constable reported the incident, the district court sent personnel to verify that the ten bodies of Gu Koulang (i.e., Wang Koulang), Luo Honglin, Lu Jiayu, Ding Fushan, Ma Kuisheng, Zhao Xiaolaohan, Xu Zhenhong, Zhou Xiaoerzi, Jiang Xiaogenzi, and a certain person named Jia were indeed caused by poisoning. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, it is now known that after the public prosecutor Wu Deying and the coroner Xuan Zhiming examined the bodies, they determined that they were poisoned. However, it was not easy to identify what kind of poison it was. In order to clarify the truth, they designated the body of Gu Koulang (from Chongming, living at 147 Fengtian Road) from these ten bodies to be transported to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for autopsy and examination. Cao Aixiang (age 26), a rickshaw puller from Taixing, residing at 26 Shuxingli, Yangjiabang, Zhabei, also ate at the restaurant that day. He originally intended to return home, but suddenly felt abdominal pain, dizziness, and weak legs, so he temporarily went to his friend Xu Jinfa's house (on the second floor of 10 Yangjiabang Road) to rest on the bed for a while. Unexpectedly, in a short time, his abdominal pain was like twisting, and he rolled around on the bed in chaos, and then died of breath. Later, the police learned of this and reported it to the Linping Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, he ordered Li A'er, the local constable of the 23rd Bao and 2nd Tu, to file a petition with the district court for inspection. In the afternoon, he sent Prosecutor Xie and Coroner Xuan to investigate, and it was determined that he also died of poisoning, and he ordered the family to coffin him. It was found that Jiang Xiaogenzi, who lived in Hongzhen, had a big meal at the restaurant and suddenly felt nauseous when he got home. Soon after, he vomited, and the mess was all over the floor. His family fed the vomit to the chicken, but unexpectedly, the huge rooster fell to the ground and died immediately after eating it. Those who saw it were horrified, which proved that its toxic properties were quite violent and that it was extremely rapid. After the incident, the police station sent police to take all the remaining vegetables in the restaurant, such as fish, meat, fresh chicken, and vegetables, as well as a whole basket of rice and two small wine urns (commonly known as pig gall urns), each containing half a basket of sorghum wine, to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, he ordered Ling Renjie, the local constable of the 23rd Bao and 5th Tu, to send all the above items to the district court by car. He was ordered to transfer them to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for chemical examination. On one side, the constable and the family members of the deceased, such as Ding Lanqin, father of the deceased Ding Fushan, Zhao Kunbao, father of the deceased Zhao Xiaolaohan, Lu Wangshi, wife of the deceased Lu Jiayu, Jiang Fenglou, father of the deceased Jiang Xiaogenzi, etc., reported to the district court, requesting redress. After being interrogated, they were ordered to leave and wait for the police station to bring the restaurant staff to court for a thorough investigation.</p>

It is planned to complete the telephone connection in March next year and establish a branch office in Minhang. User rental and call charges are determined by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. It is reported that in the future, calls between Shanghai and Minhang will be charged as long-distance calls.</p>

<p>Lin Axiang, a woman from Shaoxing, was twenty-six years old this year. She married Wang Wenshao in the countryside in her early years. After Wang died of illness, Axiang came to Shanghai to make a living. In November of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, she met and cohabited with Wang Xitang, a fellow villager who worked as a boatman. Later, Axiang invested 600 yuan and handed it over to Wang to purchase a barge to operate the business independently. Over time, Wang liked the new and tired of the old and fell in love with someone else, neglecting Axiang's daily life. In September of the twenty-first year, Wang's old father came forward to negotiate and agreed that Axiang would pay 400 yuan to Wang Xitang, and the two separated. In February of the twenty-second year, Axiang remarried to Peng Quanshi (age 24), a Tongzhou native who worked as a copper polisher, and cohabited at 6 Xinleli, Mintini Yin Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession. Unexpectedly, Wang Xitang was still unwilling. On the morning of the 28th of that month, he waited at Xinleli. When Peng went out, soaked in water and returned home, he caught up with Peng and fired several shots, killing Peng and fleeing without a trace. At that time, when Wang was fleeing, Axiang and Peng's brothers caught a glimpse of him and reported it to the French patrol house to arrest him. Wang hid in the Hongkou area of Pudong, because he was engaged in a water-based boat life and his whereabouts were uncertain, and the detectives could not arrest him. Until about 5:00 PM on October 14th of this year, Lin Axiang passed by Oujia Road and happened to bump into Wang. She called the 490 patrolman and arrested Wang at the Jiaxing Road Patrol House. After learning that the incident occurred in the French Concession, he was immediately sent to the French Patrol House. After investigation by Detective Zhou Buguang, he was transferred to the Second Special District Court. The legal representative of the police department filed a public prosecution for murder. The details of the trial have been recorded in previous newspapers. The case has been repeatedly heard by Judge Xiong Huiping, and witnesses have been summoned for investigation, and lawyers have been appointed for defense. It has been announced that the case has been concluded. Yesterday was the date of sentencing.

After a brief interrogation, Wang Xitang was sentenced to life imprisonment for premeditated murder. During the appeal period, he will be held at the detention center for further instructions.</p>

<p>For a good long while, he finally smiled faintly: "I've seen the person more than once, and I've talked to her. Whether it works out or not is irrelevant. What I want to know is, what exactly do they plan to do with this girl?" Xiao Ji shrugged his shoulders slightly twice and said, "If Old Master Jia is willing to take a concubine, it's easy to arrange. They aren't relying on the girl to make a fortune. It's just that they can't make ends meet, and marrying the girl off would give her a place to settle down and make a living. That way, even two generations of his family won't starve to death. When it comes to money, I don't think they can possibly ask for an exorbitant amount." Jia Duocai exhaled two puffs of smoke before replying in a rather nonchalant manner, "I'm just afraid they don't quite understand these things. You think people spend money to take concubines, wouldn't they go to big cities like Shanghai and Beijing to find them? Why come to this hard place of Xi'an to find one? I'm just acting out of kindness, seeing that this little girl and her family of three are very pitiful, and I'm willing to give them a helping hand. If their intention is just to escape with their lives, that's easy to handle. But if they want to get rich, I wouldn't dare to take it on. Please ask them to find someone else." As he spoke, he crossed one leg over the other and swayed it constantly. Xiao Ji thought to himself, "The rich are truly devils. Others barely give an inch, and they immediately tighten their grip." So he said, "Of course, they just want to escape with their lives. Don't worry, those ignorant women wouldn't be able to play any tricks that could outsmart you, Old Master Jia, would they?" Hearing this, Jia Duocai took out his cigarette holder and tapped the ash into the spittoon, with a slight smile. Xiao Ji said, "Old Master Jia, why don't you set a time?" At this point, Jia Duocai was really too embarrassed to keep declining, so he raised his hand to scratch his head and then smiled faintly, "I think you guys should set it. If I set the time, it would seem like I'm the one inviting them. Women's words are hard to say; they're bound to act coy. I think it's better to leave it to chance." (78)</p>
<h3 id="e177">A Returned Traveler's Tale from Chao Mountain <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— By Fang'an</p>
<p>When counting the places where one can enjoy plum blossoms, Chao Mountain has long stood out as a unique peak. The mountain is located in Hangzhou County, Zhejiang Province, between Linping and Tangqi. There is a highway accessible by motorcycles and buses. During the flowering season, entering its realm is truly like entering "a dwelling atop Mount Qunyu, entering the land of myriad fragrances," as the late Kang Nanhai inscribed in a couplet. Since the remains of the master artist Wu Changshuo were laid to rest here, famous figures have flocked to visit, one after another. It is said that Chairman Chiang himself once visited with his wife. This October, the plum blossoms on the ridge bloomed early. The old plum trees in the mountains have already begun to flower, dotting the branches like lingering snow after a clear sky, creating a spectacular sight. Next to the Song Plum Pavilion, the Bao Ci Temple's Fragrance Ocean Tower, which was destroyed by bandits in the past, is being rebuilt with donations from Mr. Xi Guansheng of Panyu. Construction is already underway, and by the time it is completed, it will probably be at the height of the plum blossoms and snow competing for spring. The local gentry, together with the temple monk Guang Zhou, are also planning to revive the temple, sparing no effort. Recently, they transplanted an old plum tree from the ruins of the former residence of the Southern Song Dynasty's Lord of Fortune. Its branches are gnarled and sprawling, surpassing the previous trees, and its mossy traces are a true Zhao family treasure. Guanshengyuan has also newly opened a plum forest, all striving for the sake of this famous mountain's enterprise. The end of winter is easy to encounter, and a stay during the flowering season is sure to be a refreshing experience. The Haiyun Cave has also been fully renovated, with its serene environment and beautiful scenery comparable to the misty clouds and purple mists of the lake, and new roads have been built, eliminating the need to trek over the mountain ridges. However, the Miaoxi Temple in the mountains was destroyed by fire last month, turning the magnificent temple halls into ashes, a truly great disaster for this famous mountain. Mr. Shi Liangcai also visited last month. Mr. Shi had previously built three rooms within the Bao Ci Temple, and when the temple was destroyed, these three rooms stood alone, unscathed. Now that Mr. Shi has unfortunately been attacked by bandits, the spirit of the mountain must be mourning endlessly.</p>
<p>Following the tea room attendant's instructions, I went over and opened the door. I indeed discovered that one of my relatives was lying in bed, intertwined with a woman. Seeing me, he hurriedly put on his clothes and got up, his face flushed red, as if filled with endless shame. I thought to myself silently, "Shanghai is truly a den of iniquity. The city is truly a place of crime!"</p>
<p>I urge young people not to be infatuated with the pleasures of the senses. Quickly rouse your spirits! You must know that great achievements are built on a firm will.</p>

<p>— Baling</p>
<p>People generally say, "Shanghai is a den of iniquity." At first, I didn't quite believe this statement. But now, I deeply feel that this statement is indeed true. Because in the recent past, there was an ironclad fact that gave me a powerful proof. The fact is like this:</p>
<p>A relative came from the countryside. Deeming me worthy, he came to visit me. Of course, as the host, I had an inescapable duty to entertain him. So, everything from eating meals to watching movies to going to the amusement park, I took care of him one by one. Finally, I borrowed room X at the XX Inn as a place for him to stay.</p>
<p>For financial reasons, we borrowed a single room, with two people sleeping in one bed. I thought that in early winter, this would be very suitable. So, we settled down to sleep. Because I had traveled a lot during the day, I was very tired. Before long, I was dreaming of the Duke of Zhou, sleeping soundly and snoring.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as dawn approached, I woke up and found that my relative was nowhere to be found. This was truly very strange. Finally, I learned from the tea room attendant's report that he had opened another room, and there was a woman accompanying him.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Drifting Fragrances: A Record <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, after Emperor Guangxu passed away, because there was no grand mourning ceremony held, no relics were sent to Fengtian to be stored. This was a special measure that violated the customs of previous dynasties and cannot be considered a reasonable approach. The reasonable approach would have been to respectfully transport the Emperor's daily attire or familiar objects to Fengtian to be treasured. This practice was initiated by the first emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Emperor Shunzhi, to show that he did not forget his homeland and to elevate the status of the ancient palaces in Shengjing. Since the imperial family had all moved to the interior, the palaces in Fengtian inevitably became neglected and unoccupied. Now that these relics of past emperors were stored inside, and a high-ranking military officer was specially stationed with a team of Manchurian soldiers year-round, these unoccupied palaces would not be completely uninhabited, and their status would be elevated in an imperceptible way.</p>
<p>We started with the first palace and visited each one in turn. This first palace contained the relics of the first two emperors of the Qing Dynasty, Emperor Shunzhi and Emperor Kangxi. As soon as we entered, the Empress Dowager began to explain to us like a teacher in a classroom. Her eloquence was already excellent, but now she intentionally portrayed the history of these two emperors as grand as could possibly be. If we closed our eyes and only listened to her endless and eloquent speech, we would surely regard these two emperors as gods. Moreover, we would deeply believe that she was indeed very familiar with and cared about their past deeds. (188)</p>
<h3 id="e181">Walking the Underworld <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Wubian</p>
<p>"Walking the underworld" is not just a strange tale, it's simply a joke. However, in the countryside, people still frighten each other with it, and everyone firmly believes that it's true. As a result, those who "walk the underworld" sell their "ghostly schemes," and no one ever breaks this darkness.</p>
<p>Isn't this just a huge joke? How can living people who eat and wear clothes in this world go to serve in the underworld and do the work of catching people? But the villagers still firmly believe it. Their reason for believing is: they say that there are bailiffs in the Yang world, so of course there are bailiffs in the Yin world; there are constables in the Yang world, so of course there are constables in the Yin world. If the Yin world wants to capture living people in the Yang world, it naturally needs living people to lead the way. So, they also call this "walking the underworld" "ghost bailiff."</p>
<p>Now let me give you an introduction to this "walking the underworld": the one who "walks the underworld" is also an ordinary person, but most of them are either bored or scoundrels. It is said that after the King of Hell in the underworld appoints him to be the "underworld walker" of a certain area, when someone in that area is about to die, he leads the Ox-Headed and Horse-Faced demons to the home of that person to capture them. As for the moment when he leads them, he seems to have received a premonition, suddenly falling to the ground as if he has stopped breathing and died for a while, and then slowly regaining consciousness. Once conscious, he tells people about his experience of leading the capture and the name of the person who died. Those who see his condition and hear his story at that time all believe him one hundred and twenty percent and voluntarily spread the word.</p>
<p>However, there are flaws in the "underworld walker's" performance after all, but the deceived are not easily aware of them. Speaking of this flaw, it is his deceptive scheme. It turns out, according to his own account, he has a register, and this register lists the time of death of the person who is about to die. When this time arrives, he leads the Ox-Headed and Horse-Faced demons to capture them. But he also tells people that one can bribe in the underworld. If you give a considerable bribe, your name can be removed from the register, and you can live a few more lifespans. Since no one is not afraid of death, his scheme is sold.</p>
<p>This is really not a strange tale, it's simply a joke. However, he—the "underworld walker"—is able to sell his ghostly scheme every time under the frightening and believing of the masses. From this, it can be seen that the customs of the countryside and the knowledge of the villagers are really pitifully closed and deplorably shallow!</p>

<p>Places Visited</p>
<h3 id="e183">Mandarin Duck Lake <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Shuzi</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, and the autumn scenery will gradually disappear as the seasons change. The mournful cries of the lonely geese flying through the sky and returning south deeply stir my aimless emotions and arouse my desire to travel.</p>
<p>Mandarin Duck Lake, just mentioning this name makes people feel intoxicated. In the past, I had also yearned for the beautiful and charming lake scenery there, the picturesque lotus ponds. I had also fantasized about throwing myself into the intoxicating embrace of the mandarin ducks. However, driven by life, fantasies are ultimately fantasies, even though I have frequently traveled the Shanghai-Hangzhou road in recent years.</p>
<p>This yearning hope has finally been realized. On a Double Tenth Festival morning, Mr. C and I took the 7:55 AM express train to Shanghai and Zhapu. After two hours of travel, we arrived in Jiaxing.</p>
<p>"Going to the lake? Going boating?" Outside the station gate, there was a chorus of such voices. As we walked out of the station gate, the village girls crowded on both sides, wearing simple clothes, with gentle smiles and the pure Jiaxing accent, were soliciting every passenger who came out of the station. These are the boat girls who make South Lake even more charming and colorful!</p>
<p>The so-called "Lu and Lu legacy" is naturally no exception in a place like Jiaxing. For example, the East Garden on the banks of Mandarin Duck Lake is the leading teahouse in this area. We first had some tea in the East Garden and discussed our plans for touring the lake, in order to appreciate the natural scenery. So, we walked out of the East Garden, bought a small boat, and rowed across the railway bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou road. The Rain-Mist Tower, standing alone in the center of South Lake, immediately caught our eyes. Three or five small boats floated on the lake surface, seemingly without direction, drifting among the lotus leaves. The cool breeze caressed our faces, and along with the sounds of rowing oars, came the faintly audible lotus-picking songs of the village girls. This picturesque scene is so worth appreciating and full of poetic charm! Looking up at the sky again, we felt as if we were dissolving into nature and forgetting the mundane world.</p>
<p>As I sat in the boat, looking around at the furnishings in the cabin, I inadvertently discovered a poem given to the boat girl by a tourist. I don't know who wrote this poem, but the lingering flavor between the lines fully expresses that it was written by a sentimental person. So, I transcribed it with my pen:</p>
<p>"Meeting so巧, loving like glue, our hearts are sealed, Heaven knows! You are not pretty, I am not handsome, yet we are so good to each other! Spring flowers bloom, spring waters stir, we are all moved by spring's sentiment! Time is old, separation is too late, please recall those days, this day! Farewell, farewell, don't be sad, please recall those days, this day!</p>
<p>Spring 1934, in the midst of a frustrated life, I went mad to Jiaxing, traveled alone to South Lake, and after getting drunk, I was inspired and wrote the above lines to comfort Miss Jun as a memento of Baishuilu."</p>
<p>After wandering on the lake for half a day, we returned to Shanghai at dusk, but the day's excitement still lingered in my mind like smoke.</p>

The details of the conference are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e185">Record of Preparations for the Achievement Exhibition Zhou Bangdao <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to promote the implementation of vocational education and labor education, has held a National Vocational School and Primary and Secondary School Labor Science Achievement Exhibition. As it opens, I would like to briefly record the preparation process.</p>
<p>On April 4th of this year, the Ministry of Education formulated the Exhibition Regulations, consisting of five chapters and twenty-two articles, and issued them to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities for compliance. The main points of the regulations are: 1. All public and registered private senior and junior vocational schools and primary and secondary schools in the country must participate. 2. The address of the Preparatory Committee shall be in Nanjing. 3. The exhibition period is set from October 10th to 20th, 1934. Provinces, cities, and districts should hold preliminary exhibitions separately before September 1st. 4. The scope of exhibits is divided into two parts: A. Main exhibits, which are (1) student practice achievements and work drawings from vocational schools, (2) student labor achievements and work drawings from primary and secondary schools. B. Supplementary exhibits, which are (1) achievements of educational administrative agencies, (2) achievements of school administration, (3) teaching achievements. 5. Submission procedures: after provinces, cities, and districts hold preliminary meetings, they should select representative achievements and send them to the Preparatory Committee before May 15th. 6. Those with excellent exhibits will be submitted by the Preparatory Committee to the Ministry of Education for commendation or certificates. Schools with particularly poor achievements or schools that must participate but do not submit achievements will be instructed to pay attention by the relevant departments. On June 21st and August 11th, telegraphic reminders were sent successively to urge the quick preparation and holding of preliminary exhibitions. Later, due to matters related to the exhibition venue, it was decided to change the opening to December 1st. On August 29th, a telegraphic order was issued to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, limiting them to sending the achievement products to the Preparatory Committee before the end of October, and selecting one or two staff members from each province and city to assist in the transportation, display, storage, and other matters related to the achievements. As of October 9th, several points were further notified: 1. Regarding the exemption from customs duties, the Ministry jointly with the Ministry of Finance printed tax-free passports. 2. Regarding the reduction of road transportation fees, the Ministry of Railways approved a reply stating that it could be handled in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Price Reduction Regulations for Railway Transportation of Educational Supplies. 3. Regarding the reduction of iron ship transportation fees, the Ministry of Communications approved a reply stating that it had instructed the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to charge half the original freight rate to show preferential treatment. These are the important matters that the Ministry of Education notified to the educational administrative agencies of various provinces and cities regarding the holding of the exhibition. The Preparatory Committee members, in accordance with Article 7 of the Exhibition Regulations, consisted of eleven to nineteen people. On July 28th, the Ministry of Education appointed Section Chief Dai Yingguan, Supervisor and Section Chief Zhong Daozan, Supervisors Tang Xifen, Gu Zhaolin, Zhou Bangdao, and five others as Preparatory Committee members, and Supervisors Tang, Gu, and Zhou temporarily served as Standing Committee members. On October 9th, Section Chiefs Zhong Lingxiu, Xu Yiqiao, Wu Yan Yin, Yu Dehui, and Specialist Li Jiaxiang were added as members (Xu later did not serve due to official business). Because the exhibition period was approaching and affairs were complicated, Division Chiefs Gu Shusen and Lei Zhen, Counselor Chen Panzao, Secretary Yi Keli, and Section Chief Guo Yunfeng were added as members on November 15th, and Division Chief Gu and Counselor Chen were designated as Standing Committee members.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee was originally divided into: 1. General Affairs and Reception Group, 2. Collection and Display Group, 3. Evaluation Group, 4. Editorial Group. Later, with the approval of the Vice Minister, the second group was changed to the Display and Layout Committee, and the third group was changed to the Evaluation Committee. Personnel were assigned successively. The director of the General Affairs Group was Gu Zhaolin, the general director was Zhou Yongnan, and the section chiefs were Lin Guanying, Peng Shuren, Zhong Zhong, Wei Xuezhi, and the staff were Shi Wei, Zhu Shusen, Wang Lun, Li Weiguang, Shen Lun, Yang Shiwei, etc. The chairman of the Display and Layout Committee was Tang Xifen, and the members were Gu Shusen, Wu Yan Yin, Chen Panzao, Li Jiaxiang, Zhong Lingxiu, etc. The staff were Liu Yiting, Yuan Dinghua, Yang Yanjun, Lou Yongqin, Weng Zhida, Shen Qingchi, Xue Tianhan, Jia Guoen, Yang Jingzhong, Shu Yu, Gao Zhicheng, Duan Dajia, Huang Longguang, Ding Yizhong, etc. The chairman of the Evaluation Committee was Gu Shusen, the director of the Editorial Group was Zhou Bangdao, the section chiefs were Yi Keli and Guo Lianfeng, and the staff were Wang Wanzhong, Huang Wenqi, You Chunmao, He Bolie, Yan Geli, Mo Guokang, Guan Zuxiong, Xie Zhuozi, Li Ruoxu, Lü Shutang, Zhang Guangxin, Zhao Chengyin, etc. Outside staff were hired: Zou Yitong, Lou Tongmao, Zhao Rusen, Ding Zhaonan, Chen Zhejin, Zhao Xue, Yan Shuji, Yin Changnian, Hu Yunlong, etc. The Preparatory Committee held thirteen meetings before and after, and convened one meeting with all staff members and representatives from various provinces and cities, and the various groups held several separate meetings. However, the progress of various affairs was often decided by informal ad hoc meetings.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing in this preparation was the issue of the exhibition venue. The Lizhi Society, the YMCA, the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, the Central University Auditorium, the Examination Yuan Mingzhi Building, the old site of the Ministry of Communications, and Chaotian Palace were successively consulted and surveyed, but they were not easy to resolve, either because of scheduling conflicts, insufficient space for display, or the high cost of renovations. In order to take into account the magnificent architecture, neat location, large area, and suitability for display and layout, it was decided to extend the exhibition period and use the Mingzhi Building as the venue. Dean Dai and Secretary-General Xu readily agreed to lend the entire building after the temporary examination of audit personnel and the closure of the Kaoquan meeting, which is very commendable. The Mingzhi Building is the examination venue of the Examination Yuan and has a close relationship with education. Moreover, the practical manufacturing and vocational subjects and labor subjects that have not been stipulated and are not easy to stipulate in the higher examinations, general examinations, and special examinations now have the opportunity to gather the national achievements in the "selecting the worthy and capable" venue of the country, the significance of which is also very thought-provoking.</p>
<p>The preparatory expenses were more than 11,200 yuan, which was approved by the Ministry of Education to be submitted to the Executive Yuan and then submitted to the National Government for approval, and was drawn from the preparatory funds for educational and cultural undertakings this year. Because the use was very strict and the budget was limited, all aspects were unusually frugal. The equipment required for the display, in addition to hundreds of self-made wooden ladder-shaped racks, row racks, and board racks, etc., the Ministry of Railways lent all eighty-one steel cabinets used in the National Railway Exhibition, which were transported from Tianjin to Nanjing. They were very elegant and saved costs. How grateful we are for this kind of convenience.</p>
<p>Those who participated this time, except for Xinjiang, Guizhou, Xikang, and Mongolia and Tibet, included Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Chahar, Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and other twenty-six provinces and cities. The exhibits from the four northeastern provinces have been reported and are on their way. In total, there are more than 29,700 exhibits in twenty-eight categories. The exhibitors included 169 vocational schools, 337 middle schools, 139 normal schools, 868 primary schools, seven educational administrative agencies, nine social education agencies, and two educational academic groups. The venue was divided into four pavilions: Yanmao Hall was the first pavilion, the lower floor of Mingzhi Building was the second pavilion, the upper floor of Mingzhi Building was the third pavilion, and Xiji Hall was the fourth pavilion. The provincial and municipal units in each pavilion were allocated according to the number of exhibits. Large machinery was feared to damage the floor, so the cement ground and grass in front of the second pavilion were used as display locations, and two reed sheds were built in the empty space behind to store racks and exhibit boxes.</p>
<p>Regarding the display of exhibits, the main purpose was to [blank] the overall achievements of each province and city, so each province and city [blank] unit took the school category as the warp and the exhibit category as the weft. The order of the schools was vocational schools first, followed by middle schools, normal schools, and primary schools. Vocational schools were ordered by agriculture, industry, commerce, household affairs, and others. Middle schools, normal schools, and primary schools were ordered by crafts, agriculture, household affairs, teaching aids, and others. All exhibits that were damaged, inferior, worthless, or clearly counterfeit were removed in order to avoid losing the original intention of the exhibition.</p>
<p>The logo of this conference originally intended to draw a wheel, symbolizing the emerging industry, with the seal characters "heart" and "hand" superimposed on it, representing the joint training of hands and brains and the omnipotence of hands.</p>

<p>Later, Vice Minister Duan came up with the idea of two male and female students jointly pushing the wheel forward, indicating effort, labor, cooperation, and progress. Mr. Xu Beihong, a professor at Central University, was specially invited to draw the manuscript, which has rich connotations and is worthy of cherishing.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese people have paid considerable attention to vocational education and labor education, and those engaged in education have also made considerable efforts. However, there is no way to make an overall observation and comparison of the actual achievements. This time, gathering the national works in the capital for a solemn exhibition, the appropriateness of the need and the depth of the intention are self-evident. The colleagues secretly plan to select outstanding achievements after the evaluation is completed, take photos separately, and slightly imitate the idea of ​​the National Children's Model Works Collection published by the Central Exhibition of Elementary School Achievement Products in Japan, and publish the National Vocational Labor Excellent Achievement Collection (name not yet determined), so that it can be permanently observed and encouraged.</p>
<p>Due to limited ability and time, the colleagues of this association have prepared hastily, and there are many shortcomings. It is with a feeling of shame and fear that I hold the pen to describe this.</p>

<p>(Explanation) (1) The number of vocational, normal, middle, and primary schools includes provincial, municipal, and county schools. The middle and primary schools attached to some national universities are also included. (2) Vocational and remedial schools are included in the vocational school column. Jointly established vocational and normal schools are counted in the county column. (3) Private middle and primary schools affiliated with private universities and normal schools are included in the private column. (4) The list of exhibits from Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Qinghai provinces does not specify the exhibits, so each column is vacant.</p>

<p>The exhibition area is being arranged by the representatives of the province. The distribution of the exhibits is similar to that of Shandong. The dyed and woven fabrics of the vocational schools are pleasing in both style and color. The silk fabrics are also very good. In addition to leather suitcases, the leather products also include a leather making sequence unit. Chemical reagents are used to make samples and placed in bottles. There are a total of eight large machines such as drilling machines, etc., which are displayed outside the venue. There are also many specimens of agricultural crops and chemical products. The electric car model made by the middle school department uses dry batteries to make the car move. The manufacturing method is ingenious. The physics instruments, biological specimens, and models of people of various countries are all very good. The teachers' college makes the most teaching aids, and they are very exquisite. The labor works made by primary schools are mostly toys. The betel nut carvings are particularly exquisite. Turning from here, you will see the Beiping City exhibition area. The large machines of the city's vocational schools have not yet been installed. The metalwork ranges from sand casting to Shoucheng machinery, forming a unit. In addition, there are household items and other items. Applied chemistry includes paints, cosmetics, leather, ceramics, various embroidery pieces, fabrics, and carpets, and the most distinctive are stationery and clay models of human races. The newly invented textile machine of the private Han's Women's Vocational School is especially outstanding among all the exhibits. In middle schools, metalwork is made of wire, and woodwork, stonework, and bamboo work are mostly carvings of various stationery, furniture, and portraits. Embroidery is divided into Western embroidery, pile embroidery, and Hunan embroidery. Weaving includes woolen clothing, and items woven from willow and cattail are all special products of Ping City. Primary schools also have woodwork, bamboo work, clay, wax, and plaster work. There are also biological specimens, etc., totaling more than 2,000 items. Passing this is</p>

<p>The primary school section is arranged first, so what catches the eye are all toys and children's favors. Other items include embroidery and sewing, animal and plant specimens, and bamboo and wood work. The national defense weapon design unit made by primary schools throughout the province has a total of more than 80 models of various weapons of the sea, land, and air, which is the most outstanding part of the labor achievements of primary schools in the province. The normal school department has many kinds of self-made new teaching aids. The anatomical specimens, phonetic symbols, arithmetic, and various physics teaching aids are all distinctive. There is also a kind of table-top iron cake, which is the invention and creator. The pottery made by the middle school department is very interesting, and the physics teaching aids are also self-made. In addition to ordinary cloth, brush embroidery, and metalwork, the vocational exhibits also have many kinds of satin design drawings hanging on the wall, and the meticulousness of the intention is quite commendable. There are about 2,000 exhibits from the province. Re-enter the second hall, located under Mingzhi Building, and the small room facing the door is (to be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e202">The Shanghai Municipal Council's Consideration of Educational Policy Will Continue According to the Original Plan <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The Request of the Japanese Community Was Not Met</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently reconsidered the case of the Japanese community's request to change the educational policy. At the Board of Directors meeting on the 28th of this month, it was decided to reply to the community, stating that the Council has considered the issue from various perspectives. At present, for the educational interests of any foreign community, it is impossible to further promote it, which would affect the Council's school construction plan. The Chinese education in the concession urgently needs to be improved and expanded, and the construction of (Chinese children's schools) cannot be hindered by the former. The current policy should still be temporarily followed, and schools should be established by the Council, taking into account the financial resources. At the same time, private schools, both Chinese and foreign, should be given subsidies according to the current method.</p>
<p>It is found that the original suggestions of the Japanese community include four items: (1) Stop running Council-run schools; (2) Provide subsidies to the schools of various foreign communities; (3) The annual amount of subsidies should be based on the educational budget for 1934 (including both regular and temporary items); (4) The distribution standard should be determined according to the number of students or the number of taxpayers.</p>
<p>During the consideration of the Education Committee, the Chinese members also submitted a written opinion, arguing that the original plan in 1931 should still be followed, and the benefits of increasing the number of schools should not be sacrificed by increasing subsidies. Subsidies can indeed reach a larger number of students, but increasing the number of Council-run schools is enough to improve the level of education. Therefore, both should not be neglected. The report submitted by the Director of Education in June also pointed out that the level of subsidized schools is generally lower, and the Council has not been able to directly intervene. Therefore, the advantages of subsidies still depend on the amount of fees and whether the supervisors of each school can cooperate closely. The opinion paper argued that the current policy should still be followed, and the eight-year construction plan should continue to be implemented. After the completion of this plan, it can accommodate 7.5% of Chinese students, but it is only enough to meet the minimum needs.</p>
<p>At a recent meeting of the Education Committee, the financial relationship between the opinion paper and the Japanese community's suggestions was discussed together. With regard to the original suggestion to use the construction fee drawn from public bonds in the temporary budget to allocate subsidies for routine expenses, it was considered inconsistent with financial principles and could damage the credibility of the Council.</p>
<p>In the Japanese community's letter of suggestion, it was pointed out that Council-run schools cost a lot, but only a small number of children benefit. In the opinion of the Chairman of the Committee, this should be remedied. The Director of Education recently had a plan to establish simpler schools, which is an effort in this regard. As for the issues of subsidies in the original letter of suggestion, they may not yet be well understood. In the opinion of the Director, the Council's policy already contains both the establishment of schools and subsidies. Although it has been implemented for three years, it is still in the experimental stage. As far as we can see at present, there seems to be no reason to sacrifice the school construction plan and greatly increase subsidies. On this point, the Director believes that the Chinese Committee's opinion paper is quite appropriate. However, one of the members of the Committee believes that the Council's eight-year construction plan has been finalized and cannot be changed. The original plan is temporary in nature and allows for reconsideration in the future.</p>
<p>After a detailed discussion among the members, it was considered that the Japanese community's suggestion could not be implemented, and the Board of Directors was asked to reply. The Board of Directors then resolved as above.</p>

<p>Today at 2:00 PM</p>
<p>To Be Completed by the End of August Next Year</p>
<p>Culture and life cannot be separated for a moment. Cities are places where the population is concentrated, and cultural construction is especially urgent. The residents of Shanghai have reached more than 3.4 million, and the previous cultural facilities were either too small or simply non-existent, which is a pity. Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai, was aware of this, so he designated a vast area in the central business district as an administrative area, with a part of it for cultural facilities, and encouraged private groups to rent land here to establish exhibition venues related to culture and education. In January of this year, he also ordered the municipal government and most of its bureaus and departments to move into the central business district to work, leading by example and laying the groundwork for the realization of the Greater Shanghai Plan. Furthermore, as cultural construction cannot be delayed, in addition to preparing to build a municipal sports field in the southwest of the administrative area to meet the needs of citizens to exercise, the municipal library and museum will also be built in the administrative area as a source of learning and research for citizens. The municipal sports field, gymnasium, and swimming pool have already been laid and are under construction, and they are scheduled to be completed by the end of August next year. The groundbreaking ceremony for the two libraries and museums will also be held at 2:00 PM today. The construction and arrangement of one of the classes will be briefly described as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e205">Library <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>External Engineering: This library is located in the central business district administrative area, between Fuxing Stone Road and Funan Stone Road, south of Fuxiwai Road, facing west and east, opposite the museum. The plane is in the shape of a "work" character, and the two ends of the front part extend horizontally and protrude forward and backward, forming a wing room. The maximum distance between the north and south ends is about 66 meters, and the maximum distance between the east and west ends is about 51 meters. The construction area is about 1,620 square meters. The total area of each floor is about 3,470 square meters, and the volume is about 25,000 cubic meters. Most of this library is a two-story building, and the average height of the outer wall is about 12 meters. However, a gate tower is set up in the center of the front, and its ridge is about 25 meters above the ground. In the future, if there is a need for expansion, there is no need to raise the existing library building. It is only necessary to add houses of the same number of floors on the remaining land behind it to increase the capacity to more than twice.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Internal Engineering <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the layout of the internal ground floor, the entrance in the center is a hall, about 12 meters wide and 13 meters deep, passing through the passages on both wings and the grand staircase to the upper floor. Behind the hall is the magazine and newspaper reading room, about 17 feet wide and 14 feet deep. Further back is the book storage room, about 30 meters wide and 11 meters deep, leading directly to the back door. This book storage room is a specially high one-story type (the outer wall is about 13.5 meters high), so as to install a five-story steel bookshelf of more than 2 meters high. The total length of the books arranged is about 15,000 meters, and it can hold about 400,000 volumes. The lower floor of the left wing is for various offices, and the lower floor of the right wing is for the children's library, the rare book storage room, and the lecture hall (about 10 meters wide and 18 meters long). The center of the second floor is divided into two parts. The front is the exhibition room, about 22 meters wide and 13.5 meters long. The back is the borrowing room and the catalog room, about 17 meters wide and the same length as the above. The left and right wings are the passage research room and the special reading room. The horizontal parts at both ends are reading rooms, about 26 meters wide and 10 meters long, each of which can accommodate 150 seats. Above the front of the center of the second floor, there is a mezzanine for storage. From here, you can reach the flat roof behind, and use the open-air steps to climb the gate tower. This gate tower can be used as an exhibition hall, and its surrounding platform can be used for climbing and overlooking the distance. A part of the magazine and newspaper reading room is excavated to build a basement for installing boilers.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Material Arrangement <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Exterior of the Hall (see illustration): A hybrid style combining modern and Chinese architecture is adopted. Purely Chinese style would be too expensive and not entirely practical. The gatehouse is covered with yellow glazed tiles, adorned with magnificent ornaments. The surrounding platform garden features stone railings, fully displaying the characteristics of Chinese architecture. The entire building is constructed with steel reinforced concrete for fireproofing. The exterior walls are built with artificial stone. A large platform is set in front of the main entrance, planted with flowers and trees. Flagpoles are erected on either side of the platform to enhance the grandeur.</p>
<p>The interior of the main hall, reading room, and exhibition halls is decorated in a purely Chinese style of splendor. Vermilion columns are installed. The floors of the stairs and corridors are paved with polished stone. The floor of the reading room is covered with cork tiles, while the floors of other areas are covered with parquet flooring of oak and rubber tiles.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Expenditure Distribution <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The project budget for this hall is 300,000 yuan, excluding the cost of steel bookshelves in the library. The construction project was awarded to Zhang Yutai, which began in September of the 23rd year [of the Republic] and is scheduled to be completed in August of the 24th year [of the Republic].</p>
<h3 id="e209">Museum <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>External Works: This hall is located in the city center administrative district, between Fuqian Left Road and Funan Left Road, facing west from the south side of Fudong Outer Road, opposite the library. The floor plan is similar to the library, but the two ends of the front wing only protrude slightly forward (see museum illustration). The maximum distance from north to south is approximately 68 feet, and the maximum distance from east to west is approximately 58 meters. The building area is approximately 1,900 square meters. The total area of each floor is approximately 3,430 square meters, with a volume of approximately 19,000 cubic meters. The central part and the front two wings of the main building are two-story structures with an exterior wall height of 10.5 meters. There is also a gatehouse, with a ridge height of approximately 24 meters. The protruding parts of the front two wings and the rear two wings are single-story structures, with an exterior wall height of approximately 6.5 meters (see front and side view illustrations of the museum). The future expansion plan of this hall also aims to add buildings on the remaining land, which can triple the building area after expansion.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Internal Works <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Internally, the central entrance on the ground floor is the lobby, approximately 17.5 meters wide and 14 meters long. Attached are stairs to the upper floors and rooms for cloakroom and sales. Inward from here is the main hall, approximately 11.5 meters wide and 18 meters long, where the main staircase is located. On both sides of the main hall are corridors leading to the offices, research rooms, and storage rooms in the left and right wings of the front part. The protruding part of the left wing is the library, approximately 10 meters wide and 15 meters long, accommodating approximately 100 seats. The protruding part of the right wing is the lecture hall, with the same length and width as the library, accommodating approximately 300 seats. The layout of the second floor is divided into three parts as exhibition halls, the largest of which is the front left one, measuring approximately 17 meters wide and 14 meters long. The two wings are calligraphy and painting exhibition halls, each approximately 11.5 meters wide and 25 meters long, covered with glass skylights. Above the front exhibition hall on the central second floor is a mezzanine floor, level with the flat roof at the rear. From here, large open stairs lead to the gatehouse on the fourth floor. The gatehouse also has a platform around it for distant views. There is a basement under the lobby for the installation of boilers and other equipment.</p>
<p>Material arrangement: The appearance of the hall is roughly the same as the library, but the beams and columns of the gatehouse are exposed. Fountains are installed in front of the protruding parts of the left and right wings to enhance the appearance. The entire building is also a steel reinforced concrete fireproof structure, and the exterior walls are built with artificial stone. The interior decoration aims to create a suitable background for the exhibits. The lobby and main exhibition halls are decorated with red pillars and palace-style painted railings. Most of the floor is polished stone, while the floor of the important exhibition halls is inlaid with flower-patterned sandalwood. The corridors are also paved with polished stone. The lighting of each exhibition hall aims to project the most light onto the exhibits without reflecting into the eyes of the visitors. The area for hanging paintings is illuminated from above and the sides, allowing the light to shine obliquely on the wall, so that visitors can face the bright paintings in the shadows, making them brighter and clearer. The lighting equipment adopts the "indirect" style, with the same purpose as above. Since the upper exhibition halls do not have windows, but rely on glass skylights for lighting, artificial methods must be used to exchange air. The hall is equipped with ventilation equipment to distribute cold and warm air separately according to the changing seasons.</p>
<p>Expenditure Distribution: The project budget for this hall is 300,000 yuan. The construction project was also contracted by Zhang Yutai, which began in September of the 23rd year [of the Republic] and is scheduled to be completed in August of the 24th year [of the Republic].</p>
<p>The above description only concerns the engineering aspects of the library and museum in the city center area. As for the collection of books and magazines in the library and the acquisition of display specimens in the museum, efforts should be made to achieve perfection in order to meet the needs of promoting culture and to fulfill the purpose of building a great Shanghai. However, this matter is significant and cannot be accomplished overnight. It is said that Mayor Wu Tiecheng spares no effort in planning and managing the construction and prosperity of the entire city center area and the cultural needs of all Shanghai citizens. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will rise up to assist and witness its success together.</p>

<p>75 to 34</p>
<p>Western Youth basketball held seven consecutive matches starting at 4 PM today. The final match was the Group A match between Tongji and Jiangwan, which was expected to be highly competitive. The results of yesterday's matches were: (1) Yuezhong defeated Tongwen, with a score of 17 to 10 in the first half, and a final score of 45 to 15. (2) Business School defeated Lieding, with a score of 13 to 12 in the first half, and a final score of 40 to 21. (4) In the Group A match, Southern Star lost to the Western Youth Pirate Team. The difference in strength was significant. However, in the first ten minutes, the Southern Star athletes bravely fought, and the score was very close. After 9 to 13, the Pirate's tall man Ryan showed his prowess, scoring on every shot. Southern Star gradually fell behind. In the second half, Southern Star relied entirely on the young player Liu Jiang to support the remaining game. As a result, 75 to 34, the Pirates won a great victory.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Literature and Life <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>A few days ago, I received a letter from a poet who once exclaimed why he didn't follow the late poet Zhu Xiang. Inside, it said, "I always want to leave this so-called literary scene and become a shop assistant or a small clerk or something. First, it can solve the problem of livelihood; second, perhaps I can write different articles because of the changes in actual life. Otherwise, I will be desperate," etc. Reading it couldn't help but make me think of the difficulties of a literati's life, but mainly, it made me think of the importance of actual life in literature. I want to talk about this issue very simply here.</p>
<p>Indeed, observing life is not the same as experiencing it. There are indeed such people among our country's writers. Because they have no practical experience of life, they rely solely on the writer's subjective method of understanding to observe or even speculate. As a result, the life reflected in artistic works often has gaps or inconsistencies with actual life. Many examples of this can be found in the works produced in recent years. (Of course, there are also subjective conditions such as the artist's technique, but the lack of practical life experience can be said to be the main reason.) Therefore, now that I have read this poet's letter, as someone who is a poet and wants to become a shop assistant or a small clerk, I very much agree. An artist who can delve into the actual life of the people is always better than someone who hangs around in the so-called literary scene doing nothing. (The possibility and importance of observing life cannot be covered in this short article.)</p>
<p>In fact, artists cannot do without knowing life. They can only draw their own images from reality, from life. The richer their life experience, the richer their storage of images. Therefore, they will be able to create the necessary stories more freely for their own images and their own purposes. Gorky once said that the more complex and diverse an artist's life experience, the more he will be elevated and his horizons broadened. This is an unchangeable truth. Artists must depict the truth. They must embody reality in all its truth, in its contradictions, its direction of development, and in a historical perspective, in their artistic images. Artists must express the truth of life, its essence, through images of typical significance. They do not deal with general abstract laws that summarize various phenomena, but they deal with phenomena taken from individual objects or phenomena, and in the end, from direct life, and then grasp and describe the most typical phenomena in the form of sensory images. Only truthfulness is the prerequisite for all great works of art. Without complex and rich practical life experience, sensitive artistic sensibility, and correct methods, it is impossible to grasp the truth of reality in the way described above. The reason why Balzac is a greater artist than all the Zolas of the past, present, and future is precisely because in "The Human Comedy" he reflected the entirety of his era as clearly as if it were reflected in a mirror. And Balzac's ability to achieve this, needless to say, was also due to his rich life experience and his thorough method of analyzing reality, transforming objective social reality into concrete images contrary to his worldview. Sinclair's "The Jungle" is said to have been written after he spent some time working in a slaughterhouse. Most of Gorky's works, especially "Forty Years" and several autobiographical works such as "My Childhood," are records of his lived experiences.</p>
<p>Deeply immersing oneself in the torrent of social reality, closely observing, experiencing, and understanding life, and closely studying reality is a prerequisite for a great artist.</p>
<p>I look forward to the creation of great poems by the poet who wrote to me in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e219">"Spiritual Transformation" <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Luo</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang Yu "believes that in the society of vulgar people, spiritual transformation is a child becoming a lion, and a lion becoming a camel." I still don't understand what he is afraid of about "camel." I have a good impression of "camel." I often think of a picture: a vast desert, camels carrying heavy objects, with perseverance, advancing step by step. Isn't this a symbol of life? Camels carrying the great mission of life, bravely moving forward. In the desert, there are certainly violent winds and a lack of water, but the camels ignore these, they must complete their mission. This is also a life of struggle, because camels have to fight against hunger, thirst, and violent winds. Therefore, the spiritual transformation of "child → lion → camel" is the most correct and meaningful process of life.</p>
<p>However, in this society of vulgar people, "spiritual transformation" is not as simple as Mr. Xiang Yu says. "Child → lion → camel" is precisely one type of spiritual transformation in a society of vulgar people. At the very least, we can find other spiritual transformations. In fact, this society is complex enough, and people's lives are also extremely complex. But society is not static after all, it is changing forward. In the process of change, we can discover many kinds of spiritual transformations. I think, in addition to the "child → lion → camel" spiritual transformation that chases after society, at least two other spiritual transformations can be discovered: "child → → → pig" and "child → lion → → etc." Naturally, there are other spiritual transformations, but these few are the most common and typical.</p>
<p>Lu Weifu, the protagonist in "In the Tavern," is a typical example of spiritual transformation. In his childhood, Lu Weifu "went to the City God Temple to pull off the beards of the statues," and also "argued about methods to reform China to the point of fighting." This was precisely the golden age of transforming from "child" to "lion." But as Lu Weifu gradually stepped into society, in the changing tides of society, after being washed over several times, he could only lose heart and decline. He said, "I am naturally much more numb now," "But I am like this now, just going through the motions, muddling along..." This is transforming from "lion" back into "pig." Aren't there many such people in today's society? They have lost the courage of their youth and are living a "pig"-like numb life, just waiting for the final slaughter. Aren't there many people in society who are shaking their heads and sighing, "Life is meaningless"? In fact, it is precisely because they have given up on life. Look, they are waving the banner of "living one day at a time." I ask, what is the difference between this and the life of a "pig"? Therefore, this kind of spiritual transformation is: "child → lion → pig."</p>
<h3 id="e220">Windy Night <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>Even the daytime is like nighttime, gloomy and hazy, with not a single ray of sunlight visible. At times like these, one feels that even the faintest, yellowish sunlight is as hot as an electric stove.</p>
<p>At night, the wind comes.</p>
<p>It roars wildly, making one think of those fur-clad friends in the deep mountains and forests, opening their huge, cave-like mouths and slowly stretching their bodies to howl at the sky. The long howl hides an invincible majesty.</p>
<p>One's nerves are like a worn-out leather bag, contracting and twitching, with cold air seeping into the pores: the shivering winter!</p>
<p>I'm sick, so weak.</p>
<p>Tightly wrapped in that cotton quilt that was thrown under the bed in the summer, the icy air drills in mercilessly. It would be best to be swaddled in a small quilt like a newborn baby, or like a corpse being tightly bound when put in a coffin. Hugging the flattened pillow, I smile enviously.</p>
<p>The ten-watt light bulb, which is usually considered too dim, seems too bright when I'm sick. Lying facing the light, the glare stings my eyes until they feel like they're about to burst with pain. Turning away, the white wall is just as stimulating to my vision. Let me close my eyes...</p>
<p>Like a kaleidoscope of flashing lights, everything sways around me, before and behind. I've turned into the thousand-eyed bodhisattva from mythology, light on the left, light on the right, light everywhere...</p>
<p>The wind has taken over the world!</p>
<p>Quietly, the leaves rustle, and one can hear the old tree trunks swaying. The leaves fall, chasing after each other, kissing the ground. Then the branches brace themselves again, with great strength!</p>
<p>I can guess that tomorrow morning, those two elm trees and the locust tree will definitely be as bald as a monk's head. This is the straightforwardness of the north. Yellow leaves can stay on the branches for a month or so, but a sudden gust of wind can blow them all away.</p>
<p>I forgot, there's also a raspberry bush in front of the window.</p>
<p>Even the door and windows become restless, unable to stand still, swaying back and forth: bang, bang... countless times. That window, which couldn't be closed a few days ago because the wood had swollen, was planed down a layer after borrowing a plane from the landlord's carpenter. Now that the wind has picked up, it's shrunk again and become loose.</p>
<p>Let them bang, anyway, the door is locked from the inside, so I'm not afraid of ghosts coming alone. I prop myself up and get out of bed, walk to the door and turn off the light. Although the light in the hallway is still shining in, it's faint after all. Oh, moonless windy night! I crawl back into the quilt, shivering continuously. The burning heat from the original illness has dissipated a bit, and a layer of cold air floats on my forehead. I press down on my chest, and a wave of nausea comes again. Small worms seem to be biting in my intestines, with a stinging pain.</p>
<p>Habitually, the landlord's radio is always playing at night. What was it singing? An old, long-forgotten "Falling Flowers and Flowing Water" plays again, I can't tell whose delicate voice it is.</p>
<p>Silently cursing the landlord's heartlessness, making noise all night long. And then...</p>
<p>"A person far away from home!" I mutter, pressing my face hard into the pillow. Isn't that so? The family letter that just arrived is still lying beside the pillow. On it is my father's half-open-eyed sigh, the decline and chaos of the end of the century: my younger brother's words, filled with sorrow, coming from his innocent heart. He understands people's struggles and hard work; hardship has made a child precocious and intelligent! In my mother's crooked handwriting, her deep love and pity are revealed, which covers up the suffering she has endured in the world.</p>
<p>Ivy-like thoughts entangle this sick heart.</p>
<p>While the wind dominates the world. Dim, rampant.</p>
<p>In my sleep, I gallop on the wings of the wind.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Tomorrow (5) <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Wu Xiangyu (Josepb Conrad)</p>
<p>Everything was delayed like that, and everything was being prepared for tomorrow in the same way. So many packets of flower seeds, enough to fill a box, had been selected and were ready to be planted in the front garden. "My dear, he will undoubtedly want you to participate in giving some advice on planting flowers," Captain Hagberd said to her, hinting, as he walked past the iron gate.</p>
<p>Miss Bessant lowered her head and concentrated on her work. She had heard all this many times. But often she would get up, put down her sewing, and slowly walk to the wooden fence. These gentle fibs also had some magic. He had decided that his son would never leave again because he had no home, and he had prepared a home for him. He had filled another small house with all sorts of furniture. She imagined it all brand new and painted, piled up like in a furniture store. There were several tables covered with coarse linen; several rolls of carpets, thick and upright, like parts of pillars, and white marble tips, revealing some light from the dark recesses. Captain Hagberd often described the items he had bought to her, just as he would to someone with a legitimate right to use them. Perhaps the barren patio of his small house could be paved with terrazzo... after tomorrow.</p>
<p>"We can even tear down the woodshed. You can hang your clothesline outside, and your flowers won't be spoiled." His eyes squinted, making her feel slightly ashamed.</p>
<p>The delusion that had infiltrated her life due to the compassionate impulse in her heart was not without reasonable circumstances. What would happen if his son came back one day? But she was not even sure if he had a son; even assuming he was somewhere, he was always far away. When Captain Hagberd aroused his emotions in his conversation, she had to pretend to believe him to calm him down, and even cover up her disapproval with a little smile.</p>
<p>Only once had she pointed out the doubtful nature of a hope that would ultimately lead to disappointment, but the end result of her attempt startled her greatly. The old man's face immediately showed extreme horror and distrust, as if he had seen a crack in the heavens.</p>
<p>"You... you... you don't believe he drowned, do you!"</p>
<p>For a moment, he, it seemed to her, was about to go mad again, because under normal circumstances, he was much more rational than people imagined. However, shortly after the emotional outburst, he would return to his previous extremely affectionate and gentle state.</p>
<p>"Don't be frightened, my dear," he said with a slight cunning, "the sea cannot hold him, he is not a seafaring man. None of us Hagberds are seafaring, just like me: I didn't drown. Besides, he's not a sailor at all; if he's not a sailor, he's bound to come back. There's nothing that can stop him from coming back."</p>
<p>His eyes started to squint again.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow."</p>
<p>She never said that again, for fear that the old man would go mad immediately. He depended on her. She seemed to be the only sensible person in town; he openly rejoiced in front of her that he was able to get such a calm wife for his son. The rest of the townspeople, he once said to her trustingly with some anger, are very strange in the way they look at you, the way they talk to you - he never got along with anyone in this place. Don't like these people. If his son hadn't liked Ercolbrook, he wouldn't have left his hometown.</p>

<h3 id="e223">The Gentry <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>I am a person who does not understand worldly affairs, nor do I know how to fawn over the local gentry. My social skills are at best those of a primary school student. When I meet those local gentry, my heart panics. And I am naturally not good at speaking. I really envy those friends who can talk, but although I am not good at chatting (meaningless chatting makes me dislike it from the bottom of my heart), my eyes do understand other people's hearts, and I often quietly describe a person in silence.</p>
<p>Normally, I don't associate much with the gentry, and I rarely visit them. Sometimes, when I encounter gentry on the street who have some connection with me, or who are relatives or my childhood teachers, I always greet them respectfully first. I don't care what expression they will reply with or whether they should even acknowledge me.</p>
<p>Indeed, gentry always have a gentry-like demeanor. They have special eyes to look at people. I sometimes foolishly think that I have already been seen by them as such and such. Let me guess! But there's no room for guessing. Many "facts" have proven to them that I am an improper youth, such as when I ran away from the store a few years ago; when I made trouble with the professors; and most recently, when I became unemployed (of course, in the eyes of the gentry, it's because I couldn't do anything well, and unemployment is only natural, and perhaps they all expect me to be begging on the streets in the near future). Also, I write poetry even though I am getting poorer. In a word, I clearly heard a certain gentleman snorting and cursing me:</p>
<p>"That kid deserves it!"</p>
<p>I don't want to defend myself about the so-called "deserving it" situation. They are gentry, and I dare not offend them!</p>
<p>I still have a breath of ambition, and a person who still has a little hope for himself will not die and should work hard. In poverty and ridicule, I must get up, like a small grass by the roadside, being stepped on by passersby, but it insists on nodding towards the sun.</p>
<p>Recently, at a certain occasion, I had the opportunity to meet with those gentry again. They all looked at me with contempt, which was only natural! In the gentry's gatherings, I am always coldly treated by them.</p>
<p>Several "young masters" of the gentry were my childhood classmates, and now they are of course university students under the foreign dignitaries. They also have an air of gentry, which I don't admire much. They are not yet worthy of being gentry. In the future, I can't guarantee that they will definitely become gentry. The old gentry will die, the era will move forward, and the gentry's gold medal may lose its luster.</p>
<p>Correction: In the second section, first line, of Mr. Zang Kejia's poem "Elegy" published in this journal on November 22, the word "歲" (sui, year) in "剝開守歲的心的年輪中" (peeling open the annual rings of the heart guarding the year), was originally written in simplified form as "止不." The typesetter carved this character as is and put it in. The proofreader did not correct it, and the editor was also lazy and did not correct it in the next day's issue. Who knew it would be misunderstood, so we must quickly clarify it to avoid further misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Special Issue on the International Grand Hotel</p>
<h3 id="e224">The Origin of the International Grand Hotel <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>While there are many Chinese-owned hotels in Shanghai, there is a distinct lack of facilities for accommodating foreign guests. Nowadays, with the intermingling of cultures and the increasing number of foreign tourists visiting China, our country lacks suitable accommodations to entertain guests from afar. Consequently, the lodging, dining, and all other hospitality matters are still entrusted to Western-owned hotels, which is quite regrettable. Therefore, the new high-rise building of the Joint Savings Society, the only one of its kind in the Far East, was leased to organize the International Grand Hotel Co., Ltd. to operate a new hotel business and remedy this deficiency. The address is centrally located, the architecture is magnificent, the layout is novel, and the service is meticulous. It is in no way inferior to any foreign-owned residence in Shanghai. The characteristics are briefly listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Architectural Excellence: The building stands majestically at the corner of Bubbling Well Road and Nanking Road, facing south towards the Racecourse, occupying more than two acres of land. Towering into the clouds, it offers a panoramic view of Shanghai. The scenery of Wusong and Longhua, with their clouds and trees, seems to be right before one's eyes. Even distant Kunshan and Sheshan are faintly visible. The entire twenty-two-story building is constructed entirely of steel and concrete, standing three hundred feet above the ground. It was designed by the local architect Hudec, and the latest architectural principles were adopted for the light and air throughout the building. The exterior is clad in domestically produced black granite, and the interior is also lined with precious jade-green marble. A 700-foot-deep artesian well has been drilled to supply water to the entire building. It can truly be called the culmination of modern architectural excellence.</p>
<p>(2) Room Amenities: The hotel has a total of over two hundred rooms, divided into single and double rooms. Single rooms all have a cloakroom and washroom, while double rooms also have a sitting room. All decorations incorporate the best of Chinese and Western styles. Rental fees are calculated on a daily or monthly basis, according to the convenience of the customer. It has the characteristics of a Western-owned hotel, but with lower prices and greater comfort.</p>
<p>(3) Installation of New-Style Elevators: These new-style elevators are also the first of their kind to be installed in Shanghai. They can travel six hundred feet per minute, so it takes only half a minute to go from the bottom floor to the roof. Each floor is marked with illuminated indicators that are clearly visible. The same markings are also installed inside the elevator so that passengers can see which floor they have reached. The opening and closing of the elevator doors are automatic. There are a total of three elevators for customer use, and two more for transporting luggage and servants.</p>
<p>(4) Allocation of the Entire Building: The ground floor houses the Joint Savings Society's all-steel vault and various mechanical rooms. The first floor is the headquarters of the Society and its various departments. The second floor is the grand dining hall. The third floor is the kitchen and arcade. The fourth to thirteenth floors are the hotel's various rooms. The fourteenth floor is the small dining hall and rooftop garden. The fifteenth to eighteenth floors are beautifully decorated and well-furnished apartments. The nineteenth floor is the directors' office. The twentieth and twenty-first floors have water tanks in the center. The roof is used by the Municipal Council to establish a fire lookout tower for the protection of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>(5) Organizational Outline: The following gentlemen serve as directors of the International Grand Hotel Co., Ltd.:</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Huiqing</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Zhengting</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Guangfu</p>
<p>Mr. Gui Yanfang</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Daquan</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Zuomin</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Bijiang</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Hanqing</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Xinzhi</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Boqun</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang Zhongyong</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Ertao</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Shoulian</p>
<p>From among the directors, five executive directors are elected to preside over all personnel and administrative matters:</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Xinzhi</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Boqun</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang Zhongyong</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Ertao</p>
<p>Mr. Gui Yanfang</p>
<p>Supervisors:</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Jie</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Di</p>
<p>Mr. Min Dihua</p>
<p>(6) Organizational Features</p>
<p>A. Training of Attendants: The hotel has established a training center to promote vocational education and in view of the lack of training for attendants in various hotels in China. One hundred and eighty young people who have graduated from schools are selected and taught hotel application knowledge, focusing on courtesy, demeanor, and physical education. They are also trained to be patient, quick, and hygienic. The teachers hired are all specialized experts. Each student undergoes more than six months of academic training and practical experience, and is assigned to serve in the hotel. Those with excellent performance are promoted to higher levels. This opens up new career paths for young people. Dormitories are built on Zhongshan Road and a large sports field is built to ensure the physical and mental health of the attendants in order to train these specialized talents. The scale of this endeavor is probably unimaginable.</p>
<p>B. Exquisite Cuisine: Special types of utensils and equipment are ordered from British and American factories. The equipment is exquisite and unique, much of which has never been seen in Shanghai before, such as various pure silver tableware from the Austrian Berndorf factory and automatic dishwashers from famous American factories. A famous French chef is specially hired to preside over the dining affairs, which will surely refresh our palates in the future.</p>
<p>C. Comprehensive Facilities: The hotel has spent a huge sum of money and two years of time to adopt the latest Chinese and Western inventions and the most luxurious equipment, such as air conditioning, carpets, etc. The furniture is manufactured by the famous Shanghai companies of Mayar, Taison, and Sincere, using high-grade wood such as Austrian beech and teak, sprayed with transparent and colorless paint. Each strives to create unique designs. The stair railings are decorated with carved steel, and the walkways are covered with five-color rubber carpets. In short, the purchase of every item and the installation of every device has been carefully considered and reformed by experts several times to ensure comfort, quietness, cleanliness, and beauty.</p>

<p>The tallest 22-story building in the Eastern Hemisphere was constructed by Fook Kee Construction Company</p>
<h3 id="e225">A Visit to Fook Kee Construction Company <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>The height of the 22-story building of the Joint Savings Society is a creation for the Eastern Hemisphere. Shanghai had never seen it before. All construction companies lacked experience, and the Joint Savings Society did not want to rely on foreigners. After several considerations, it did not use the bid price as a criterion, but relied on reputation and experience. Therefore, Fook Kee Construction Company was able to obtain the construction rights without the lowest bid price. Now the building has been completed, standing tall and majestically overlooking the sea. This is indeed the unique vision of the Joint Savings Society, but the spirit of struggle of Fook Kee is also commendable. The reporter does not hesitate to be verbose and now publishes the general situation of the company in the newspaper for the research of entrepreneurs. Fook Kee Construction Company was founded solely by Mr. Tao Guilin. Mr. Tao is from Nantong. He lost his father when he was young, and his family was poor and he could not study. At the age of twelve, he came to Shanghai to learn crafts. He was very hardworking and did not indulge in bad habits. He was also frugal and thrifty. With a little savings, he founded the company.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the scale was very small and the reputation was not well-known, so there were not many projects undertaken. Before the company was founded, Mr. Tao had worked in the construction industry for fifteen years, working hard and studying carefully. He realized that the poor organization of Chinese construction companies and the conservatism of construction technology allowed foreign construction companies to rise and thrive. Therefore, he had the idea of organizing his own company, but he was limited by financial resources and could not fulfill his ambition. After the company was established, the initial capital was only 50,000 yuan. Mr. Tao devoted himself to management, striving for scientific organization and artistic construction techniques, while also paying attention to solidity and durability. He also adhered to the principle of low profits, and sometimes even sacrificed profits. Therefore, the projects he built, such as the Jiande Savings Society, the China Wharf, and the Shilong Hospital, were all very satisfactory to the owners. In a few years, his reputation grew greatly. In 1928, he won the bid to build the Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and his business flourished like a bamboo pole rising in the sun, and his name became well-known.</p>
<p>Because the original company address was not enough for office space, in 1929, the head office was established on Jiujiang Road. Later, with the increasing development of the business and the increasing number of employees, the original location was not enough, so in 1930, it was moved to the Enterprise Building on Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao also realized that construction executives tended to be experienced but lacked academic knowledge. Therefore, he generously donated money to establish a vocational junior high school in his hometown of Lvsi, Nantong. It opened in the autumn of 1930, specializing in teaching civil engineering and architectural subjects, and opened a workshop for practical training. In order to cultivate poor children, the fees were extremely low, so the annual burden of regular expenses was quite large. In the summer of 1933, the first class graduated. Mr. Tao arranged positions for them one by one, and no one was left out.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Tao had great ambitions, and his business was not limited to Shanghai. The Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, the Xiamen American Consulate, the Haizhou Barracks, the Henan Arsenal Branch, the Qingdao Shipyard, the Guixi Iron Bridge in Zhejiang, the Zhongzheng Bridge in Jiangxi, and the Lishi Society, the Chongqing Meifeng Bank, and the Huaiyin Diversion Sluice Project were all built by the company. His business was almost half of China, and the capital amount had been successively increased to 400,000 yuan. His organization and management were also very perfect. The head factory was located on Gordon Road in this city, the first factory was located on Guanglin Street in Zhabei, the second factory was located in Qingning Temple in Pudong, and the head office was located on Sichuan Road. There were no less than dozens of branches and branch offices, with hundreds of employees, including more than ten with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, and countless people with rich experience. The factory was only established for ten years, and the construction projects had reached more than 15 million yuan. Now the process of undertaking the construction of the Joint Savings Society is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Installation of Steel Frame: The installation of the steel frame was the first step in the company's construction of this project. All the beams, columns, and internal materials were pure steel frames. The construction method used two machine cranes to alternately use to erect the steel frame. Each crane had a lifting capacity of seven and a half tons, and the rivets were compressed air. This project started on August 16, 1932. The first two layers of steel frames were erected, and after accurately measuring and verifying the entire level, they were successively connected upwards. On average, one layer was connected every three days, but after reaching the fourteenth floor, due to changes in the drawings and the fact that the manufacturers could not supply materials on schedule, it was delayed, and it was not completed until mid-April 1933.</p>
<p>Concrete Engineering: After the steel frame was erected, the concrete engineering began. Therefore, this project was the second step in the company's work. The concrete was mixed by machine. The ingredients were accurately mixed according to regulations, and dry mixing was performed several times before adding water to avoid excessive moisture. Therefore, the concrete floor made according to the instructions weighed 80 pounds per square foot, and the designer and the engineers of the Engineering Bureau proved through testing that it could bear more than 350 pounds per square foot, which also showed the company's serious attitude towards things.</p>
<p>All the bottoms of the steel frames and the surroundings of the connection with the foundation were filled with mortar. The rest was 124 concrete. The surrounding area was an average of two inches thick, but the middle of the I-shaped column head was filled with hollow bricks to reduce the weight of the concrete. The thickness of the floor varied depending on the distance between the beams, ranging from about four inches to five and a half inches. As a result, the floor with a 23-foot span was subjected to extremely heavy pressure, and there was no movement. This work rate was about one layer that could be completed in ten days, and it took about six months.</p>
<p>Partitions: Partitions were the third step in the project. In order to reduce weight, all internal partitions were made of aerated concrete bricks. When paving, the aerated concrete bricks were first moistened with water, and then cemented with 13 cement mortar. The top of the paving, and the joints with the concrete floor, or beams and columns, were filled with steel wedges to make the wall stable and not easy to shake. The wall surface was plastered with a layer of 13 cement mortar to protect the aerated bricks so that they would not expand and contract due to changes in climate. Outside the cement mortar, cane board was used to isolate sound waves. The board was then plastered with hemp ash and a layer of gypsum to make it smooth and beautiful.</p>

<p>Flat Roof: This project varies in its approach due to the different needs of each floor; the first, second, third and fourteenth floors have suspended steel wire mesh flat roofs, the style of which can be the first of its kind in Shanghai. The other flat roofs, concrete floors, are plastered with a layer of hemp ash and a layer of gypsum on the bottom. The flat roof on the thirteenth floor, due to ventilation and various pipes, is plastered with a layer of 13 ash sand on the suspended steel wire mesh, and then plastered with hemp ash and gypsum. This project, due to its large area and elaborate decoration, was quite difficult to construct: its patterns were complex and its appearance was beautiful, not only rare in Shanghai, but also pioneering in Asia.</p>
<p>Roof: The roof of the building is all flat concrete floors; about four and a half inches to five and a half inches thick. This concrete is mixed with water-repellent slurry when mixing. The upper layer of the roof is laid with eight layers of tar paper, and the felt is made of artificial stone roof. The flat roof on the thirteenth floor is nailed with a layer of cork two inches thick to prevent the sun from exposing and heating it.</p>
<p>Facing Brick: The facing bricks used in this project are all colored tank bricks; using 12 cement mortar mixed with water-repellent slurry, posted on the outer wall of steel bone concrete. The inside of the wall is painted with water-repellent paint, tank bricks to give over The surface is very difficult to work with because it needs to be flat; and the corners of sharp corners and small columns must be on a straight line.</p>
<p>Scaffolding: The scaffolding for this project is different from ordinary ones because it is more than 260 feet above the ground; all of its construction and installation uses 12-inch square wood, iron threads, etc., and is connected to the steel frame on all sides, and is wrapped with bamboo fences. Every three layers must have insurance bamboo fence equipment to prevent workers from falling. In summary, this project took two years and two months, and its difficulty and complexity are unspeakable: the house is high and finished, and the decoration is extremely elaborate and can be said to be a great project unprecedented in Shanghai. However, the factory was able to complete the project with caution, and it was able to have a safe guarantee for the workers, which is really commendable. It is heard that the building of the Da Xin Department Store Co., Ltd. in this city is also being constructed by the factory.</p>

<p>General Discussion: Why are there so many tall buildings in the city? It is said that transportation is convenient, personnel are busy, products are concentrated here, and capital technology is cooperatively available here. The strength of the country is crystallized here. The city is the general meeting of all industries, and the tall building is the center of various industries. The tall buildings are densely packed enough to brighten the city, and there is no need to build a tall building without the prosperity of all industries. Tall buildings are almost a microcosm of the country. Its style is sufficient to represent the character and spirit of the people, and its physique is sufficient to represent the manufacturing efficiency of the people. A brick, a tile, a stone, a wood, a nail, a pipe, and the degree of science and engineering knowledge of the people are measured here. The distribution of its usable ground, the office area, the dining hall area, the public area, the electromechanical water vapor ventilation fire protection and other equipment area, the hall area, and the recreational reading room area are all reflective of the customs of the contemporary people. The design and selection of materials must be extremely precise, and the coloring project is even more fundamental and important. Elegant distinction, identification should be clear, construction procedures, supervision should be strict, the safety and appearance of the entire department are tied to it,</p>
<p>Examine the important building materials, soil, wood, gold paint, the first three are essential materials before construction, the latter is the coloring agent after construction, it is also the clothing of the object, so as to prevent collapse, failure, corrosion and strengthen the appearance. Water vapor carbon nourishing, fiber formed by photochemistry, the elements of wood, from afforestation to logging, until the formation of beams, desks, doors, windows, floors, artificial several guarantees, once invaded by sunlight and moisture, corruption and annihilation, still cannot be distinguished by the eyes of water vapor carbon nourishing, the topic of destruction, cement combined with steel and iron, beautiful also,</p>

<p>The permeation of moisture, freezing when encountering cold, is followed by expansion and cracking. Humidity and air further reach the steel frame directly through the cracks, expanding due to rust, enlarging the cracks, and ultimately leading to collapse. This is also a regret in construction. Clothing and objects are precisely for avoiding the ravages of the natural world. A layer of paint film is no different from an insulator between steel, earth, and air. It is a protective film. This is the first way in which the coloring project is connected to the safety of the building. Paint is a product of modern science, with types varying according to their functions, with distinctions between protecting metal, wood, and earth. The construction procedure is extremely important. If the metal surface is not de-rusted and is directly coated with metal-protecting paint, it is no different from decorating rust with paint. Before long, the rust will fall off, and the paint will also fall off. If the concrete has not dried thoroughly and is directly coated with earth-protecting paint, or if it has dried thoroughly but has not undergone a sealing procedure, and is directly coated with earth-protecting paint, it is no different from destroying the paint with alkali. Or, if paint is applied to a wet surface, if the wood has not been thoroughly dried, or if the knots have not undergone a degreasing procedure, or if the wood holes have not been filled, and wood-protecting paint is directly applied, it is no different from applying paint to grease, or applying oil to a wet surface. Blistering, discoloration, grease penetration, brittleness, peeling, all kinds of paint film diseases are due to the disorder of the procedure. Conversely, it will be smooth and beautiful, pleasing to the eye, and earth, wood, and metal paint will each be in their proper place. This is the second way in which the coloring project is connected to the appearance of the building.</p>

<p>The Strongest and Largest Vault in the East</p>
<p>Designed and Built by Shanghai New Universal Company</p>
<p>Since the dynastic change, bandit disasters have been frequent. Prosperous families have invariably moved the treasures they formerly buried underground to steel boxes and cabinets to prevent the covetousness of petty thieves. Recently, with the Eastern spread of European trends, the skills of thieves have improved daily. The wise have gradually realized that iron boxes and locks are not enough to defend against the attacks of scientific methods. Those who have precious collections are all worried and mutually seek more reliable protection. Therefore, the establishment of a vault has arisen in response to the times. Originally, vault door equipment was designed for banks to protect their own funds. Later, as social mores deteriorated and thieves proliferated, individuals had limited financial resources and could not install large vaults at home. Therefore, they adhered to the principle of collective effort and rented them from others. Initially, only those related to banks enjoyed its benefits. However, due to the frequent needs of society, a special storage department was established to become a public storage institution.</p>
<p>The new vault of the Four Banks Savings Society was designed and built by the Shanghai New Universal Company, a purely Chinese-owned organization, after the association's architects Sun Liji and engineer Wu Qingquan, along with foreign architect Udal, thoroughly discussed various new and old robbery defense methods before the construction. The company is a vault and bank protection expert in Shanghai and has been engaged in this project for more than ten years. More than half of the financial assets in the Shanghai banking industry are under the company's strict planning and protection. This project was carefully planned by vault design expert, my classmate Yuan Pilie. Under the guidance of the famous architectural engineer, it felt even more like handling a familiar task with ease. It is the strongest and largest vault project in East Asia. Having been invited to visit, I dare to record its outline as follows.</p>
<p>The new vault of the Four Banks is located under the bottom floor of the new building. The purpose of a vault is to prevent theft and also to prevent disasters. Among cities, fire and war are the most common disasters. The new vault</p>
