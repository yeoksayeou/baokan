<h3>美國與國聨恒</h3>
<p>據十四日哈瓦斯日内瓦電。美政府將任現任瑞士公使威爾遜爲駐在國聨會之特派專員。日内瓦人士咸認此舉爲美國加入國聨之先聲。與九月間蘇俄之加入國聨。不無關係云云。　　此一消息傳出後。尚未聞有何新發展。個中眞相。是否果如哈瓦斯所言。亦難逆覩。唯美國與國聨之日趨接近。則可由是而益信。我人回溯國聨會之歷史。卽知國聨之組織。本以美前民主黨領袖威爾遜總統之力爲多。此舉當能多少代表民主黨之理想與意志。今又值民主黨在美執政之秋。而國際形勢之險惡。尤甚於和約簽訂之前夕。羅斯福總統爲貫澈本黨十餘年來未竟之宿願及維持世界和平計。似不免有早日加入國聨之傾向也。　　考美國所以至今猶未加入國聨者。原因複雜。不一而足。而民主黨與共和黨之水火實其犖犖大者。方威爾孫赴歐之前。適值國會改選。威氏爲確保其赴歐行動之自由計。曾勸國民投民主黨票。不料此舉適予共和黨以大肆攻擊之口實。競選結果。共和黨在兩院中之席數爲之大增。而威爾孫宁求國會批准國聨會章與凡爾賽和約之舉。乃卒爲共和黨參議員所打消。以至於賫恨而終。當美國獨立之初。固有所謂光榮的孫立政策之標榜。然國於今日。欲求絶對之超然與孤立。勢所不許。卽證以共和黨在美近十餘年來之措施。亦可知之矣。共和黨政府之對於國聨。雖未肯正式參加。然而在國聨倡導下之國際合作事業。實未嘗漠視。而且有非正式的積極參加之勢。蓋初則僅肯與聞絶無政治臭味之衛生勞工等會議。進而參加經濟會議。終乃參加軍縮會中東路東段</p>
<h3>大批俄員又被拘</h3>
<p>俄領爲受辱事抗議　　哈埠日軍飛機失事　　戰謡甚熾人心恐慌　　（哈爾濱）中東鐵路東段蘇俄職員二十九人、今日被指爲蘇俄充間諜、致遭拘禁、内有居重要位置之工程師多人、並女子數人、以故日俄戰謡更熾、（十六日路透電）　　伯力此間接訊、八月十三日深夜已開始將中東路東叚負責路員大批逮捕、計蘇籍路員之被捕者凡十九人、内有重要車站如一面坡、馬陶寺（譯音）·海林·及綏芬河等站之站長、據哈爾濱熟悉時事者稱、此次逮捕實爲一計畫遠大之挑釁之開端、其目的在（證明）舉凡中東路東段無數次之（匪）擊、破毁車軌·襲擊車站·及路員居住地帶、（匪類）綁架路員·以及路員及其家屬數月來所身受之横暴摧殘等等、均由路員自身所主持、據可靠方面消息、此番拘捕僅爲事態之開端、以後將陸續逮捕蘇籍路員數十人、同時日軍方面擬於鐵路東段實行戒嚴、以便實際佔奪、對方於中東路出賣談判之際、常備加壓迫、而上述步驟均爲此項計畫之進展云（十五日塔斯電）　　伯方蘇聨駐哈總領斯拉夫茨基爲（滿洲政府）敬察局刑事調查部主任白俄科斯托馬洛夫無理凌辱、代理總領萊維德已向（滿國）交涉員提出抗議、按斯拉夫茲基乘因公專車赴莫斯科、當車過博克圖站、科氏卽作酣醉之態、高聲詈駡、闖入斯氏車廂、並要求斯氏交出文件、斯氏卽步入其所居間隔、取出護照、同時因其小孩正熟睡於其間隔内、故請該警留步廊内、詎知科氏不允其請、逕入其居處、續行非禮行動、迨斯氏將外交護照及滿洲當局允予飭屬保護之公函交騐後、科氏仍持其有恃無恐極端粗暴之態度、按該白俄警土對於斯氏所施非禮、必有其挑釁目的、堆此事終以斯氏之穏重自持事、遂免更大之糾紛、（十六日塔斯電）　　（莫斯科）倫敦一著名報紙載哈爾濱通訊一則、内稱蘇聨領事館職員數人、因陰謀暗殺滿洲官員、業於綏芬河車站被捕云云、嗣經塔斯社多方探詢、證明綏芬河蘇聨領館職員絶無一人被捕、同時哈埠電訊所稱、蘇領館職員參與陰謀云云、顯爲哈埠不逞之徒所揑造、蓋彼等最近正加緊其挑釁行動、以令日蘇邦交趨於緊張云、（十五日塔斯電）　　（哈爾濱）黑河俄領館秘書希瑪谷夫與俄方水路委員及外交關係者、同被滿方水路委員邀請、於十三日夜赴黑河宴會、但散會後希氏與俄方委員同在日本酒家附近散步、忽失希氏所在、俄領館大驚、立卽囑滿方委員及滿國警隊、搜查希氏行踪、一面通知俄方委員之參謀鮑爾捷、日滿軍警現仍繼續搜查、但仍無下落、又希氏卽曩日侮辱黑河日本特務機關長宮崎大尉者、故希氏之失踪、日滿關係方面均非常注意、（十五日電通電）　　（哈爾濱）（本日記事解禁）本年三月駐在伯力之日本特務機關室内有一夜警被殺、搜查犯人之結果、始悉係抗日份子襲擊特務機關計畫之一部、旋檢舉四十名、然其黨徒尚有七月八日再襲擊此特務機關之計畫、且據其黨羽之供狀、首謀者確尚在蘇伯力聨總領事館内、（十六日電通社電）　　（哈爾濱）綏芬河之戰謡、顯向西延、今日此間接訊、一面坡之白俄現紛紛售其家具等物、而遷往他處、其售價僅及原值三分之一、亦足徴人心之恐慌矣、（十五日路透電）　　（哈爾濱）今日此間有日軍用飛機一架由五十米達之高處墮地、駕機員頓時殞命、失事原因未悉、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>法俄同盟訉</h3>
<p>東歐公約如不成　　自行團結抗德波　　（倫敦）此間今日消息、法俄兩國或將於下月中締結防守軍事同盟、該約將名爲法俄互助條約、據稱俟蘇俄外長李維諾夫及法國外長巴爾都同赴日内瓦後、該約卽可成立、並聞該約係蘇俄加入國聨之一種條件、此項消息倫敦負責外交界中皆表示可信、惟必俟德國與波蘭拒絶加入東歐公約、法俄始有簽訂兩國條約之必要、美聨社復自可靠方面得息、李維諾夫現在法國休假、於軍縮委員會開會之前、將先赴巴黎與法國當局討論一切、如國聨會員三分之二贊成邀請蘇俄議。而身充最重要之一角。九一八之變旣作。九國公約非戰公約與國聨會章。同時爲日本暴力所撕毁。美國與國聨之合作。遂更進一階段。而史蒂生主義與國聨不承認决議。尤有桴鼓相應之妙。於此可見在威爾遜時代。共和黨之所以反對批准國聨會章。由於黨爭之意味者多。主張之不同者少。故識者多謂前年美國總選。卽使仍爲共和黨勝利。其與國聨之合作。亦必日益密切。蓋國聨之於美國。旣經有尊重門羅主義之明白表示。而民間輿論主張與國聨合作者。亦漸見有力。若國聨一旦改組。對於强制性質之盟約條文。有相當之修正與保留。則美國加入國聨。正非不可能也。　　質言之。美國與國聨之接近。與互相利用。實爲國際環境所壓迫。而有欲罷不能之勢。不論其爲任何政黨執政。遲早必使美國加盟而後。已唯在今日民主黨執政時代。則更有從速實現之可能。蓋羅氏對於前總統威爾遜之理想。向具景仰之忱。而今日之美國會。又以民主黨爲最多數。故加入國聨之困難。必較往時减少多多也。加入、李氏將準備宣布接受、蘇俄加入之後、國聨力量當可大增、此點法國最爲歡迎、因最近國聨對於國際糾紛束手無策、已屢受指摘、法國幾無術爲之辯護、且蘇俄加入國聨行政院後、法國所主張之軍縮事件應由國聨處理一點、亦可得蘇俄贊助、據稱法俄兩國之接近、係表示德國退出國聨、已將蘇俄加入之障磚除去、且德波親善、亦爲法所深忌、故亟欲拉攏蘇俄與之對抗也、（十五日國民電）　　捷克京城蘇聨飛機隊由民用航空局主任恩希利脱率領、業於年後飛抵此間、原定停留一日、至明日重行出發、飛回本國、此議現已作罷、蘇聨飛行家將往參觀捷克製造飛機各廠家、恩希利脱並將往克羅維伐利·瑪利安斯革拉奈·及柏勒士恩三處、參觀著名斯科達兵工廠、飛機隊現定星期五日午前出發返國、捷克各報撰文表示歡迎、特别指出蘇聨飛機隊經由巴黎捷京而返莫斯科、斯科、其所採路綫頗有象徴之價值云云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>經濟現狀愈瀕危險　　英美等國設法抵制德國自走上復興程途以來、雖痛受凡爾賽和約的束縛、軍備的限制、巨額賠欵之壓迫、但是他的經濟情况、却尚見相當的好轉、一九二九年之世界經濟恐慌、德意志所感影響最大、迨美總統胡佛宣告戰債賠欵延期時、德國金融界雖覺危險、然其對外貿易、也還不十分惡劣、那時候（九三一年十二月）德意志銀行的現金準備、有二十二萬八千四百萬馬克、外幣準備、還有一萬八千一百萬馬克、到了今年春季以後、就逐漸减少、至六月十五、其現金準備、祇有九千四百萬馬克、外幣祗有六百萬馬克、合計起來、僅有一萬萬馬克、對銀行券發行額三十四萬八千五百萬的比率、僅占百分之二·九了、回顧一九三三年、同時期金準備總數有三萬四千九百萬馬克、一九三二年同期間、則有九萬五千八百萬馬克、這是何等可驚的險象、從前德國金融界雖極度困窘、而對外貿易、却日有進境、故在歐洲諸國中尚不失爲較有利的國家、自希特勒當政以來、對蘇貿易、日漸退縮、其他各國、又努力建築關税壁壘·實行集團經濟、德國製品的向外輸出、遂大受阻碍、今年一月、卽突將四年來的輸出超過、而變爲輸入超過、祇以三月一個月計、已有三百萬馬克的輸出超過、其餘每個月總是繼續入超、本年上半年輸入、計二十三萬一千二百萬馬克、輸出計二十萬零八千五百萬馬克、實入超二萬二千七百萬馬克、去年同時期輸出、計二十三萬七千八百萬馬克、輸出超過有二萬九千一百萬、前年上半年輸出二十九萬二千七百萬、而出超有五萬四千萬馬克、　　本年上半年德國貿易所以惡化的原因、自然以世界各國都整圙的經濟衰頽爲最要、而德意志輸入的激劇增加、就形成輸出减少、也是一個重要因素、輸入之所以增加、是因爲國内工業活潑、要購買多數的原料、政府要統制經濟、要阻止輸出貿易的惡化、於是更加嚴格的限制輸入、不料竟因此而使輸出越見减少了、貿易的寛際、則并未絲毫改善、　　由去年上半季的輸出二十三萬七千八百萬馬克、到今年减到二十萬零八千五百萬馬克、因爲德國的輸出品有百分之七十八、是完全的製造品、所以就有四十萬人的技術工作者被辭退而失業、其輸出貿易衰落、還有一個關係、是對蘇貿易减退所致、當一九三二年時、對蘇輸出、計六萬二千六百萬馬克、一九三三年、就祇有二萬八千二百萬馬克了、今年因希特勒實行排蘇政策的結果、貿易减低的傾向、就越見厲害本年春季、對蘇輸出僅祗二千一百萬馬克、卽令德蘇不再惡化、也不見得卽能恢復、照這樣敷衍下去、恐怕也會减少了百分之七十以上、</p>

<p>解送第一特區地方法院、由吳廷琪推事提審、吳淞公安局派探目辛競生到院、聲請移提、先由工部局律師張天蔭陳述是案尸體發現、及公安局聲請恊助拘捕人犯之經過情形、大致與報載略同、張律師並稱據戴玉金、在捕房所供、以死者十日夜十一時、至渠家云彼即將去蘇州、彼所設之燕子窠、煩渠代爲照料、故渠當往大中里、至於饒炳南、祇承認與死者有關係、而否認謀殺、查本案可疑之點、即尸體發現處之四週、</p>
<h3>並無血跡</h3>
<p>故究竟是否在該處謀殺、抑係在另一地點殺害後而棄尸於其處者、俱有詳細調查之必要、今日公安局聲請移提、如庭上認爲猶需調查、則請展期、以便從事偵查云云、次由辛探目報告尸體發現情狀、謂尸身係穿印度綢長衫、白條褲、藍鞋、其服飾甚摩登化、兩眼均有刀傷、面部刀傷尤多、以額角之傷痕最深、流出之血</p>
<h3>已變黑色</h3>
<p>且已凝結、顯見被殺害之時間、距發見之時間、已不短暫、而尸體四圍、復無跡象可尋、似非在該處謀殺者云云、又據佘正祥投案證稱、向在死者之燕子窠内吸烟過癮、十號夜十一時許、有人打電話與死者、據聞係着其往某地取欵、死者即易穿長衣而去、嗣見報載、吳淞發現被害女尸、所記服裝、頗似死者、因與死者表姊持照片往吳淞公安局核對該局所拍尸體照片、果然無誤云云、而死者表姊王張氏、亦</p>

<p>一過、質之戴玉金供、向與丁史温認識、十號夜十一時、彼來打鐵浜三百五十一號我之姊丈陳貴友家訪我、時我方臥於門首、彼云即將與史阿才（即史文樓）往蘇州、並擬由蘇去平津、託我照管其燕子窠、我當夜遂往大中里十號、倘我亦參加謀殺、斷不自投羅網等語、饒炳南供、死者係史文樓之婦、我僅與之相識、</p>
<h3>並無姦情</h3>
<p>惟死者與文樓邇來惡感甚深、去年且曾涉訟、當彼二人在法租界設小總會時、我屢往賭博、文樓對我竟如眼中釘、但十號夜我於九時中睡、死者被害、實不知情等語並延律師聲稱、被告現充紐約等四家汽車行司賬、該四行願爲被告擔保、請求准予交保、吳推事以案關人命、不准所請、諭兩被告還押、改期查明再訊、</p>
<h3>人山人海</h3>
<p>當記者行抵目的地時、則已候看奇怪人影見老幼婦孺約百餘人、鵠立於烈日之下、待觀所謂奇怪人影之發現、此輩來觀怪影者、大多爲鄰近鎭人而由滬特來此之摩登男女爲數亦復不少、蓋爲報載此項奇影每日下午二時至三時、終必發現之故也、記者斯時於人叢中擠入楊宅門首則見雙門已緊閉、欲進内叩其主人詢問眞相已不可得、直候至五時、終不獲見、而圍觀者亦均大呼上當不止、相繼而散去、</p>
<h3>事出有因</h3>
<p>記者復向附近某雜貨店夥詢惟遍查無實據問事出原因、據稱、一星期前、有形似農夫兩人、自土地廟疾奔而來、指楊宅屋頂大呼有鬼有鬼不止、一時四鄰居民、羣趨觀看、則亦無他異、旋詢彼輩鬼係何在、則稱彼等自土地遥見屋頂上有兩人影、一男一女、忽東忽西、男者衣青布長衫、女者上服白衣、下穿黑褲、携手往來自由云云、當時觀衆、愈集愈多、無結果而散、次日同時復有多人前來、翹首觀望、有謂已見發現、有謂不獲人影、莫衷一是、時忽有一衣短衫褲之青年、毅然登屋探視、至則大呼没有没有而躍下、是日亦無所獲而散、自此以後、街坊人言嘖嘖、因之每日來望者亦絡繹不絶、究竟眞相、莫名其妙、若謂有其事、亦無從證實也、</p>
<h3>楊宅家中</h3>
<p>又據該鎭居民方面之口述、據説有狐狸精楊名性初、有妻子兒女各一、以農起家、稍有積蓄、去年秋間、曾有一狐狸精發現、但其家人則稱不知、今者奇怪人影之發現、或即爲狐狸作怪云云、傳説如是、記者未敢深信也、</p>
<h3>老人揣測</h3>
<p>時有一年約六十餘歲之老人斷爲墻影反射名褚茂芝者在旁、據語華東社記者謂、據余（即褚君）之揣測、定爲側面之墻壁反射所致、蓋一般勞苦者、在如斯烈日之下行走、視力自必眼花瞭亂、故遠望確有黑白之墻垣反射光、即至鄰近自必不見矣、倘陰天或日光不烈之際、亦無此影也、故鬼怪之説、絶對不可信、王大方可憐</p>

<h3>論作品的内容（續）</h3>
<p>－答李求是君－　　據我們的意見、通常説的作品的（内容）是不簡單地指着主題和材料而言的。社會上的萬事萬物，未經作者選取時，呌做材料，也呌做題材、旣經選取，便是主題了。材料與主題並不是一篇作品内的兩件並立的東西，材料與作品的藝術價值並没有直接，關係有關係的，乃是主題。但這兩者，統不能説就是（内容），即是，一篇作品，並不能因爲它有主題，有人物，背影，有故事的進行，就可算是有内容的作品。内容，是主題通過了形式，已經完成它的藝術價值。（藝術價值又是包含在社會價值之中的）内容本身便包含藝術價值。我們批評某庸作品的内容充實，乃是説某篇作品是有意義的；不僅主題有現實性，而且在製作上還能發揮主題的積極性。反之，如果一篇作品，即使也有人物，但是死去了的人物，而不是現社會活生生的人物，即使也有主題，但是一些社會的沉渣，而不是現社會血淋淋的事跡，那我們批評那篇作品没有内容或内容空虚，决不是（惡意的抹殺的論法）。穿了袍的菩薩，我們不會認牠有生活，這是誰都明白的，其實，一個對於世界不敢正眼一視僅能吃飯睡覺生兒子的活死人，又何能説他有生活？生活旣不是指五官四肢，也不僅是吃飯睡覺，乃是指人在現社會的戰塲上求生存的積極活動，這活動是於人類社會有意義的。作品的内容，也是一樣。千篇一律的一個水兵誘姦一個姑娘的小説，我們批評他一句，（没有内容），並不是寃枉，因爲這種題材，根本是社會上的殘渣，絲毫不含有藝術的價值；充斥市塲的神怪俠義小説，我們批評它一句（没有内容），也並不寃枉，因爲那些作品的主題旣不含有現實性，那裏的人物，世只是（天上有世間無）的人物。所以内容旣不是（主題），更不是（材料）而是包括在形式中的，附有藝術價值（社會價值）的作品的本質。</p>
<p>以爲一在中國，没有内容的作品還没有出現的理論家是有意抹殺内容，而替形式裝幌子，即是形式論者，他們認爲形式是一切，凡是社會上的萬事萬物，均可當作作品的内容，只要描寫得充份處理得妥當。試問，一個儍子，能够由於裝飾而變成一個活潑的聰明的人嗎？不可能的！呢塑木雕的菩薩，無論你怎樣去裝金，終於還是泥塑木雕的菩薩。這就説明了内容之所以决定形式，而形式並不能决定内容。即退一步説，所謂描寫得够不够和處理得妥不妥，也並不是一個單純的技術問題，仍不能不歸到内容上去。譬如，同是描寫中國的災荒，有的能够深切地繪出災荒的全面目，有的却只能觸到浮淺的片面，這是什麽原因呢？這裏就含有作者認識現實的眞切與不眞切的問題。認識，是構成作品内容的動力，對於現實認識不眞切的作者而望其筆下能描寫得充分，這不是在白天做夢嗎？中國没有内容的作品，正充滿了整個文壇，前進的批評家們也正應該從作品内容去下刀，去割裂切没有内容或内容空虚的作品。</p>

<h3>苗中風土記（二）</h3>
<p>— 覺</p>
<p>苗民衣服，在湖南鳳凰乾城永城三縣者，俱皂黑布爲之，上下如一，其衣帶用紅者，土人指爲紅苗，纒脚並用黑布者，指爲黑苗，纒脚用青布白布者，指爲青苗白苗白苗，衣摺繡花，及纒脚亦用之者，指爲花苗，考之志乘，以前統謂之紅苗，而土人指爲黑苗者，則以苗衣深黑之故，至用紅帶花帶纒腰，青布白布纒脚，亦其老塞舊習，相沿不改，非於紅苗之外，又添黑青苗白苗花苗等種類也，不過苗民之居於貴州之有溪松桃二縣者，服飾頗潔，喜穿白布衫，婚嫁慶賀，皆服之以爲美觀，考苗疆之中，昔有白蠻，則此苗民，殆其苗裔歟？　　　苗民惟寨長薙髮，餘皆裏頭椎髻，去髭鬢，短衣跣足，着青布衫，間用黑布袴，腰繫紅帶，領亦尚紅，衣週邊，俱繡綵花於邊，富者以網巾束髮，貫以銀簪四五枝，　後戴二銀圈，左耳貫銀環如盌大，項圍銀圈，手帶銀釧，衣服縶錫皮，纒青布行縢，足雖厚如獸繙，能晨枯根，趨青芥，捷如猿猱，此爲苗民之絶技，其婦女銀簪項圍手釧行縢，皆如男子，惟兩耳貫銀環三四五不等，總之以多誇富，衣較男子爲長，而用錫片紅絨或繡花卉爲飾，頭帶銀梳，以銀絲密繞其髻，裹以青繡帕，腰下繫帶，下身不着裏衣，以布棉爲裙，而青紅間道，繡團花爲飾，亦有繫錫鈴繡絨花爲飾者，苗女未嫁者，額髮中分，結辮生後，以錫鈴海蚆藥珠爲飾，而苗民於深冬嚴寒，但衣兩三重單衣，不衣棉絮，傴僂彳亍風雨中，貧富如一也。　　苗民日常兩餐、春夏始三餐，以粟米苞榖諸雜糧爲飯，而於蔬菜，則俱生啖，渴飲溪水，得魚貴之，得鹽寳之，其得鹽也，恒以一撮置掌中舐之以爲美，畜肉用火燎去其毛，烹而食之，不知五味，客至則煮薑椒湯以示敬云。　　苗民無同姓不婚之嫌，然屬親族，亦不相配，完婚新婦與母同宿，必婿餽婦母銀始去，名曰娘錢，亦曰乳錢，大約不過三兩，富厚之家，見他苗有女美者，令其子牽其背，名曰搶親，女家亦利其有，不更許人，旣亦通媒灼，議財禮，其處女與人通者，父母知而不禁，反以爲人愛其美也，若犯其妻妾，則舉刃相向，必得錢拆贖而後已，夫婦不相得，則夫棄其妻而别娶，婦棄共夫而别嫁，不相禁也。</p>
<p>苗民夏日，男女共浴於河，婦人見客，惟以手護其兩乳，餘則弗避也。</p>
<p>苗民男婦，並事耕作，山多於田，宜榖者少，每燔榛蕪，墾山坡，種芝蔴粟米麥豆苞榖高粱蕎麥諸雜糧，旣種三四年，則棄地而别墾，以墾熟者，磽瘠故也，棄之數年，地力旣復，則仍墾之。</p>
<p>苗民出人，必腰背負籠，其籠以竹爲之，旁有兩繩，貫於兩肩，秋成以穫雜糧，平時則負柴薪，至負重致遠，則先用背扛，以木板爲之，形如半架，置於項後，着於肩上，貫繩以繫於首，然後背寵負物，故其負籠，終不離其身也。</p>
<p>苗中婦女亦知飼蠶，惟不曉育種，春間俟民間蠶出時，結伴負籠，以貨物易之，育成上簇成繭，則抽絲染色，製爲裙被之屬，作閒道方勝雜文，第不如湖南永順保靖土人峒錦，作鶴鳳花鳥之更工緻也。</p>
<h3>禮砲與驢鳴</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>在湯南堡紀念碑將軍塔内，安眠着目耳曼的英雄——興登堡！當他舉行國葬的時候，禮砲轟鳴一零一響，葬禮之壯偉嚴肅，在近世的歐洲是少有的！</p>
<p>興氏生前在湯南堡立過戰功，砲聲是聽慣了的！現在就把他卜葬在和他一生榮譽有密切關係的地方，並鳴禮砲一零一響去安慰他的英魂，可謂切當之至。</p>
<p>在中國，够得上稱做英魂的雖不見多，但安慰幽魂的方法倒是有的，不過不是禮砲；因爲幽魂經不起嚇，而和尚道士那套細吹細打的（陰樂），倒滿合脾胃春秋</p>
<p>。這是（英）（幽）二魂資格不同的地方！</p>
<p>漢末魏王粲好驢鳴，旣葬，曹丕臨其喪，顧與同遊曰（仲宣好驢鳴，可各作一聲以慰之）。弔者皆爲一作驢鳴，這眞是前無古人後無來者的特别趣聞。推想他們引吭作驢鳴時那副神情，不禁令人失笑。而王粲的幽魂，在曹丕意中竟須用到這種方法才可得到安慰，也可算得奇人奇事！</p>
<p>因而想到現代的社會，如果在（棺材裏伸手）那種朋友的墳上把洋錢摔得鏗鏘作聲，倒或許是安慰（貪魂）之一法！</p>
<h3>馬龍生傳</h3>
<p>— 震</p>
<p>馬龍生又名和尚，是松江某校的一個門房，他雖是校工，打扮得却很入時，金牙齒，西裝頭。服裝自紡綢布衫褲，嗶嘰長衫以至皮袍子洋大衣各式俱備，而且式樣都很摩登，不知者竟疑爲是什麽府裏的大少呢！</p>
<p>一天，有一個姓朱的學生的家長來看他的兒子，這家長是個（鄉曲之士），見了龍生，以爲他是本校的教員，於是很鄭重的向他鞠了個躬，問道：（先生！朱××在麽？）當時這笑話就傳播了全校，（先生，朱××在麽？）隨處可以聽到，據説這朱××是個漂亮的西裝少年，爲了這事，眞羞得没臉見人。</p>
<p>龍生雖然是這樣的漂亮，這樣的摩登，但是肚裏却全無學問，裝足的完全是草包敗絮，某日事務處在門房裏下了道佈告：（此間室小人多禁止吸烟…………）龍生見了，朗誦曰：（此間室，小人多，禁生吸烟…………）讀畢大怒，（事務眞眞勿是人，我們雖然做工人，但志氣宏大，而竟目爲小人，禁止吸烟，豈有此理，豈有此理！）</p>
<p>當時就召集全體校工，開全體大會，欲向事務處大興問罪之師。開會時，龍生主席，陳述開會主旨後，就將該佈告揭衆，憤憤之辭，溢於言表，當佈告傳到印講義者阿林時，笑着説：（龍生！你錯了，事務處之佈告是這樣讀法：（此間室小人多，禁止吸烟…………）是恐怕發生火警，不是（此間室，小人多，禁止吸烟…………）讀法，這樣意義上是不通的。）於見衆人大笑而散會，龍生却紅的臉。説：（恐怕不是吧？）</p>
<p>最近由盛君來函，説及龍生將要去考交通部的水手養成班（？）想不久咱們中國，又要多一個航海人才了。</p>
<h3>碎片</h3>
<p>— （珍）</p>
<p>據調查所得：私娼在日本東京約有一千五百人，公娼則有六千、咖啡女却多了，約有三萬人以上。其中有高中程度的約四百人，大學程度的有五十人，高小程度的有三百五十人，初小程度最多，六百五十人。</p>
<p>有人説：女人的人格和所穿的鞋的鞋根，高低分反比例。這倒亦有三分道理。</p>
<p>再據日本東京市之調查：東京共有一萬六千人的職業婦女。其中月薪在百元以上者，不過二十三人，次爲記者，有五十三元，女工監督則每月有五十元，平均數之月薪是三十元七角。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這條皮帶約莫有四五尺長，上面滿繫着許多的小鈴，所以不論那個專門服侍狗的太監把它牽到什麽地方去，都不難一找卽得；如其它高興跑得快一些，急一些的話，也許在相隔很遠的所在，也可以聽到鈴聲。</p>
<p>讀者别小看了那個專門服侍這條（御犬）的太監，他的職務委實是很够麻煩的，而且責任又奇重。就像狗所吃的飯食，也得他親自去調弄。－海龍的飯食當然是非常精緻，而且是時常更換的，但比較吃得最多的肝臟，和着肉汁，跟初煮就的白飯一起拌。－調弄好之後，還得送到張德那裏去，意思是請他看一看，决定好用不好用；但張德那裏敢擔這樣大的干紀，他每次總是恭恭敬敬的捧着這碗狗食，走到太后跟前去請示。太后見了，非但不以爲忤，且必十分認眞地檢查一番，如此發現有什麽不合的地方，譬如嫌飯煮得不熟，嫌肝臟太不新鮮，嫌肉湯用得太少等等，伊總是不肯將就放過的，一定要他們捧回去重弄；這樣，那個專管門狗的太監，便免不掉要受張德的一頓臭駡了，并連那禦膳房裏的廚夫，也得同遭訓斥。</p>
<p>我至今還記得很清楚，那個服侍狗的太監老是裝着一副鄭重其事的神氣，挽着那個巨大的竹筐，在車廂的一角上站着。途中，每逢車子停的時候比較長久一些，我們大家都走下車去閒跳的當兒，他往往也帶着這個竹筐走下來。第一步，先是小心翼翼的把筐子安在地上，然後輕輕地將那海龍抱出筐來，替它繫上了那條滿掛着無數小鈴的皮帶讓它隨便散步。平常牽狗的人總是人牽狗，而這個太監，决不敢如如此大膽，他只能給狗牽，就是永遠的順從那狗的意思，它要往東，就往東，要往西，便望西，非萬不得已時，人是一些不敢作主的。（一○七）</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>愛而考克路講話</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>從華德路監獄所在之處起、向北，稍稍偏西，可以一直通到岳州路東端，靠近公共租界界綫的地方的，是愛而考克路。</p>
<p>這愛而考克路並不是一條説得上有相當長度的路，而且剛剛相反，應該算是一條無關緊要似的短短的路，可是從租界歷史上看，也有一點不無可説的地方。原來它和塘山路相接處以南的一叚，是屬於一八九三年（光緒十九年）美租界擴充的區域以内，而以北的那一叚，則是一八九九年（光緒二十五年）新闢所謂國際公共租界時劃了進去的。</p>
<p>路是如此，路名所紀念的那個人，却更多歷史的意義，説是租界歷史上最重要的人中之一，是一點語病也没有的。</p>
<p>愛而考克Alcock，在此較老一點的中文書上，譯作阿利國，最初字旁還都多一個口字，表示譯音的意思。他的名字呌羅善特Rutherford。後來，因爲他在中國的工作得到英國政府的讚譽，賜給了（爵士）Sir的頭銜；雖然在另一方面中國作者稱之爲（與華商感情最惡之英領。）</p>
<p>是的，羅善福特。愛而考克是中英五口通商之後，英國駐上海的第二任領事。他在一八四六年（道光二十六年）接任領事之後，做下的事眞是寫不勝寫的。</p>
<p>現在黄浦灘英領事署的基地，雖然購買的事情發動於第一任英領巴爾福福，可是繼續磋商終於得到本國政府核准的，是在愛而考克手裏。與滬道麟桂交涉將英租界面積從八百三十畝擴充到二千八百二十畝的，也是愛而考克。</p>
<p>這擴充英租界面積的實行是在一八四八年（道光二十八年。）同年，青浦發生英國教士與該地居民及糧船水手衝突的事情。受傷教士回到上海，英領愛而考克便親訪滬道王紹復，要求懲兇賠償。滬道説：（鬥毆細故，不足深詰。一愛而考克聽了大怒，語侵道台，手中剛持有長柄摺扇，便舉扇打道台的頭。道台拂衣而入，對上海縣知縣金咸説：（華洋雜處，平民鬥毆，這是極小的事，要我去壓迫本國百姓，獻媚洋人，我是不會的。）然而不僅道台的頭是白白的給打了一下、並且後來因爲愛而考克派人去南京向兩江總督極李星沅申訴的結果，終於將青浦水手十人在黄浦灘加枷示衆，又得賠欵二百兩。</p>
<p>愛而考克之爲人，其潑辣有如此者。等到後來太平天國興起以後，租界採取所謂武裝中立的政策，自行改訂地皮章程，組織工部局——這些使租界開始轉變爲現在租界的狀態的重要歷史事件，愛而考克實在是一個主動者。也許就因爲是這樣的一個人，他升任了英國駐華公使。做了公使之後，他又主動了一件與上海租界關係重大的事。原來在太平天國時期内，上海租界當局的種種行動，爲駐華英公使布魯司和美公使般林蓋所十分不悦，不惜（以教訓小學生的態度）訓示其上海領事、無效，乃又提出於公使團，通過改組租界的原則五條。這是一八六四年（同治三年）的事。後來，租界納税人修改地皮章程，將那五條原則之一，即在工部局中加入中國諮詢委員一層、訂入章程草案。但到一八六五年（同治八年）經公使團批准的地皮章程中，却删去了那種規定了。爲什麽？却是因爲相當地以中國主權爲念的英使布魯司和美使般林蓋那時已先後去職，而那樣的一個愛而考克做了英使了。</p>
<p>到愛而考克路去跑一跑，整部的租界介歷史不是會在你的心中翻了開來的麽？</p>

<h3>女人與裝飾</h3>
<p>— 微明</p>
<p>説來也並不奇怪，爲什麽到了夏天，關心世道人心的先生們對於男女之大（防）要突然加緊。夏天的女人的裝束實在太富於挑撥性。而（挑撥）的焦點在於肉體部分呈露得太多。所以取締女人露腿赤脚的官文正是扣準了題目的得意之作。</p>
<p>我們的祖先在山林子裏過（野蠁）生活的時候，本無章身之具；大家光裸裸看慣了，並不覺得什麽。然而這正是野蠁人之所以爲粗淺。（文明人）頭腦複雜得多了，凡事都講究個（含蓄），（有餘不盡）；從此而（聨想）也特别發達，見一光露的小腿就覺得有點那個了。其實腿只是腿而已，遠不及眉毛能説話，眼睛會（送媚）。説到這裏，就不能不佩服從前土耳其女人上街要帶面紗這一辦法爲能眞正澈底。</p>
<p>至於露了腿還要搽什麽油膏，撲什麽粉、赤了脚還要染紅指甲，從貪圖簡便凉快一變而爲要麻煩要好看，－這眞是更駭聽聞。自然，這樣搽之撲之梁之的腿，恐怕只是光腿中間極少數的一部分，牠們的目的，和普通光腿完全兩樣。此等腿不但不許牠（光），澈底些不妨投畀煤窰。所可惜者，此等腿大都坐在汽車裏，奉公守法的警察先生只好牠朝看看罷了。</p>
<p>再從反面一想，腿主人不怕麻煩而搽油撲粉，無非爲要好看。把腿弄好看了，也不是自己欣賞，而爲的是那個抓權禁止光腿的男性社會需要這等樣的裝束修飾。據説從前有過女性中心的社會。那時候，男人們是不是也像現在的女人那樣刻意艷妝，我們還不大明白。但是吳敬梓却在（鏡花緣裏給我們一個回答。（鏡花緣）裏女兒國的男人卽使是一部大黑鬍子也還要搽脂抹粉。然而現在關心世道人心的先生們讀（鏡花緣）到這一段時不肯掩卷想一想。</p>
<h3>從語言學上的見地來討論歐化問題（下）</h3>
<p>— 何鳳元</p>
<p>這樣看來，我們的歐化不歐化之爭是否也妄費口舌呢？自從語言學成爲一種近代科學以來，牠的第一條基本原理就是文字語言是活着的，是變動的。牠之所以活所以變動，就是因爲决定牠的社會關係是活着的，是變動的；説牠的，寫牠的人也是變動的。要把中國文字永遠停留在古文的階段固然是夢想，要中國文字不受外來的影響不歐化也是夢想，除非把中國社會倒退回去並且停在那裏，除非把中國海陸空都彌封起來和國外老死不相往來。</p>
<p>一國文字的接受外來的字，詞，粗分之是在下面的三個情形下：</p>
<p>（一）外國特産或經外來的關係才發現的動植物的名詞：以英語言，如“Lobeter”龍蝦，原來是拉丁字。”Ｍorquito“蚊子，原來是西班牙字。</p>
<p>（二）外國特産的商品名詞：如“Coco”可可，“Caffee”咖啡是墨西哥字。</p>
<p>（三）某一國學術方面或文化領域中任何一方面的特長會使牠這方面的字彚輸入别國文字：譬如英語中許多音樂名詞是意大利字，如“Archpelago”；許多數學名詞是阿拉伯字，如Slgebra”許多社交方面的字是法文，如“Madame”。中國文字中在這三個情形下借用的外國字更隨手掇拾就是，其中尤以從日文來的爲多。</p>
<p>明白了這三個情形，則所以借用外國字實是不得不然。外國字，詞旣然借用了，則語法中必然的也起了外國化，譬如一句話裏用了一個日本詞，（對）於，語法當然也不會純粹中是國語法了，這是至爲淺顯的理。</p>
<p>我不懂爲什麽英文，法文·日文都借用外國字（也借用我們中國字，譬如英文中的Tea就是中國字），都受外國化，而我們都要説歐化是漢奸，難道人家也是英奸，法奸，日奸麽？這完全是各國文化溝通後，在語言文字上發生的必然的結果，昧於這個理而亂喊的才眞是奸！</p>
<p>反轉來看看我們的文字未經歐化前，是否就純純粹粹的只有我們自己的成分呢？這話恐怕誰都不敢説罷！中國文化很早就受着印度文化的影響，尤其是佛經翻譯給我們不知加入多少印度成分，現在的字彚中梵文有的是，如湼槃浮屠等；而我們的變文，説話，彈詞，曲劇則連發源，形式都是受佛經翻譯的决定的。那末，那些説歐化是漢奸的還不知他們的祖宗上代早就奸過了呢！</p>
<p>還有，我們的大衆語是否絲毫未歐化呢？請問：罷工：這句話是那裏來的？上海灘上的工人都在説幾米達長的木材，幾磅煤，幾噸的船隻呢！至於技術工人所用的外國來的術語則更多。</p>
<p>自認爲爲國家民族張氣的反歐化的仁兄請摸摸自己的屁股，閉嘴罷！至於説要在中國語法裏加一點歐化，則也不是如此單純的事，不會簡單到依你心火加一點加兩點的，所以也請免開尊口。</p>
<h3>賣瓜者</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>五十多歲的一個老頭兒，看着一個小瓜攤。</p>
<p>這裏是一條小巷，瓜攤擺在小巷中一間草房的房檐下，這間房也就是他的住屋。草房是連脊的，一共有十多間。面對着這條草房的是連脊的瓦房，每間房頂上都安有一扇方玻璃，大槪是天窗吧。</p>
<p>兩面房檐下小巷的路，是用碎石舖成的，因爲年久失修，石子有的傾斜了，有的脱落了，有的讓孩子們拾去塞房屋中的老鼠洞去了，路上簡直找不出一段完整坦平的，常常有些人走着走着就跌倒了。</p>
<p>一些隣人，都呌他（怪老人，）因爲他是一個（孤身）的。别人都認爲他的日子過得很無聊的，但他每天總還是照樣活着，按時起居，作他的小生意</p>
<p>他的主顧是些小孩子，他很和氣，孩子們願意在他的攤子上化費掉從媽媽手中哭喊着要來的幾個銅板。還有，他是非常愛惜孩子們的，常常用手摸撫着他們的骯髒臉龐，或是玩着他們污黑的小手，孩子們因此更願接近他這個老頭兒。</p>
<p>他買回來的瓜是黄色瓜，有大的也有小的，隨後到巷端的井口去刷洗；先去瓜皮上的呢土；他洗的才是經心呢，那種仔細，小心，愛護神情，很像一個父親對待他的兒子似的</p>
<p>每天，在他的瓜攤旁邊，總是圍着一些孩子們，給巷中平添出一種熱閙，孩子打閙起來，爲了息爭，安慰孩子們哭呌，有時他會奉送一個瓜的。</p>
<p>他上市是隔四五天一次，臨上市的前一天，就是他的瓜要賣完的時候，同時，也可説只剩幾個壞瓜的時候，不過他還是能如數賣掉的，他减低售價，孩子們貪圖便宜，就完成了交易。</p>
<p>一條小巷本没有多大，住在巷裏的人天天相見，日久天長，大家都變成熟人了，可是，没有人知道他的内情的，他的嘴，像漆封的一般，從未向外人説過他自己的身世。</p>
<p>有些人就以爲他是一個老跑腿漢，一個没有討過女人的男人。</p>
<p>其實，他不但不是個老跑腿，反而是個兒女成行的老人，他原是在揚子江邊某個鄉村種田的，某一年的大水災，衝散了他的家園，後來剩他一個流落到上海來。都市的房屋是昻貴的，没有事作很難生活，他因而想出這個營業，幾年以來，他卽在奉行着夏天賣瓜冬天賣糖葫蘆的生意。</p>
<p>賣瓜時，他坐在一個小竹凳上右手搧着一把笆蕉扇，扇子因爲燒飯升炭火時還要搧，染上了許多炭灰，染出一片一片的黑漬</p>
<p>這樣的老頭兒，每天按步就班作着生意，時間過久。别人也就不以爲意了，可是有一天，誰也不知是什麽原故，他坐在凳子上看着瓜攤，好模好樣地忽然哭起來了。哭以前，他呆望着頭上窄小的天空，孩子們買瓜他不知道，直到把銅板放在他的手中，他才眨一眨眼。</p>
<p>哭一會，他收束了瓜攤，關上草房的門，把身子倘上破板床上。一些隣人，由於好奇，男的，女的，老的，小的爭着往窗口擠，打算看個究竟。</p>
<p>他在哭，更厲害地哭着，鼻涕，涙水都淌到床舖上。</p>
<p>可是第二天早上，他又按時擺上了瓜攤。</p>
<p>（你昨天怎的了？）</p>
<p>（你哭什麽呀？）</p>
<p>（你有痛心事麽？告訴我們好不好？）</p>
<p>别人到瓜攤前問他，他不答，只是不住地摇着頭，人們逼得不緊了，他就故意差開話頭反問着説：</p>
<p>（你們要買瓜麽？今天瓜好哇。）</p>
<p>他自己笑了。</p>
<h3>西瓜</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>老人（六）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>尚在少艾的兒的妻子，丢下一個纔只一歲半的嬰孩，嫁一個鐵匠丈夫去了。這個嬰孩就是沙夏，經過了他二十年的撫養，長成了一個粗壯的小夥子。他十分鍾愛他，也時常責駡他。在事業上，沙夏確是能給他極大的帮助，那些凡是爲老年人的精力所不能做的事，都是那個小夥子替他像牛一樣地操作；但是沙夏有時候也有牛一樣的性子。在他的眼中，沙夏常是拗不過的，要他生氣，總也不肯聽他的話。譬如偶然間街上有一個女人走過去了，沙夏就會故意跳到街上，攔住女人的去路，也許説上兩句粗鄙的話。這在他的眼睛裏，可實實在在難以看得下去，當着沙夏回來了的時候，他就用了他那粗啞的聲音説！</p>
<p>（沙夏，這你可不該！）</p>
<p>那小夥子不理他，只把眼睛翻了翻，仍然是像牛一樣地在那邊把破舊的縫衣機搬到近窗的空處。他的嘴唇在嘘着俚俗的調子。</p>
<p>（你可眞是一點體面也不懂，你該知道要尊敬女人。當着我還年青的時候－）</p>
<p>他纔説到這裏，沙夏就攔住了他的話頭：</p>
<p>（女人還要尊敬麽？我們這一代和你那一代隔了半個世紀呢！）</p>
<p>沙夏譏諷地，把鼻子嗤了一聲。</p>
<p>（年代雖然不同，男人總還是男人，女人總還是女人吧！）</p>
<p>他忿忿地，幾乎是扯了自己的鬍子，把眼睛也瞪得溜溜圓朝了沙夏望着。</p>
<p>（您不用氣急），沙夏胡意扮着鬼臉，立刻就把老年人頭引得笑起來，（這年頭的女人可您眞摸不清）。</p>
<p>（好，我看着你們吧，……）</p>
<p>説完了他就又走過一邊去，繼續方纔停下來的工作，沙夏也自唱起了曲子來，做他該做的事。</p>
<p>對於工作，沙夏却從來不曾厭煩過；可是圍住他的那些什物，時常引起他的不快。這都是那麽陳舊，幾乎每一件都是在他之先而在這世界上出現，縱然有着許多好聽的故事，也不能使他有一點興致發出來。這都是失去了光澤，灰暗的；就是去追想往日的輝耀，也多是那麽不容易，没有一點把握。他時時在問着自己：（我眞就這樣一輩子下去麽？）這時候他的心就活動起來，接着就想到：（我遲早是要走的。）</p>
<p>每一次想到離開這個陳舊的環境，就想到了他的老祖父，已經是那麽老，平時是雖使人厭煩，想到了離開却有深厚的依戀之情，年老的祖父實在是好得使人討厭，他照看他的孫子以五六十年前他的祖父照看着他的同一情形，他完全忽略了這中間有若干歲月的距離，爲這原因，在年青人那面就覺得他是多事的，絮叨的，麻煩的，不使人高興的。而且祖父又有那麽剛愎的個性，（許多人都説他是多年没有女人在身這纔如此），不容他的反辯和爭論，所以爲時常爲着祖父的好意他却是在忍着苦。</p>
<p>（若是我走了呢）？</p>
<p>他這樣想了，心中便像閃了一綫的光；但是想到他若是走了年老的祖父該怎麽樣活下去呢；他就又起始猶豫着。他知道他是他獨有的親屬，没有人來照料他，也没有人來安慰他的寂寥。可是終於他又想着：眞就使我自己也像這些貨物一樣地腐舊下去麽？</p>
<p>他還是走了，留下的短簡，使那個老年人呶呶地駡了幾天。</p>
<p>到了這個新年之後，這個老年人却殷切地想起來他的孫子，一直兩年裏，他從没有向别人説過一句，就是到現在，若是有另外的人在他面前，他也許仍然能忍得住一聲不響。實實在在地他却是深深想念着，至少在這樣的日子，若是沙夏還在這裏，就能早早關好了門，把－切該做的事情都做完，他自己很可以什麽也不管舒舒服服地睡到床上去。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>關於父子之間</h3>
<p>— 師石</p>
<p>父母之恩是不能分析的；子女應盡孝道，係一種絶對的義務。雖然父母顧然有嚴慈之别，但不能因而影響及於孝的消長與增損。這種倫理觀念，在我國歷來宗法體系的社會制度下，早就認爲不易之論的。可是在現時代，一切舊的信念，都呈着根本的動摇；任何問題常會成爲被懷疑的對象；人們對於父母之恩，也想重新的衡量一下了：根據近代一般大思想家大哲學家的論斷，大多確認（母愛）乃人類最高的天性；而一般文學家和詩人們，更多以母愛爲題材，歌頌母性的崇高優美，所以現代人對於（母親）的槪念，是把（偉大的眞愛）來替代的所謂（罔極深恩）的舊説。但是他們對於父恩父愛，却都（恝焉委懷）；大槪他們覺得一個嚴厲正色的父親，在本質上畢竟比較慈祥的母親生疏一些；而且實際上，父子間的情感確也不知母子間的親切篤愛。因此，現代人的新倫理觀念，對於母子之間，尚認爲具有不可分析的至性至情在；而父子間的關繫，便認爲應行建設在雙方情感的恊調上面了，所謂（父慈子孝），純屬一種相對的説法，與以前事親唯（孝）的絶對一元論，迴異其趣，記得不久以前，有一張從默片改攝有聲的（賢父孝子），便是充分表現着父子間情感的聨繫作用，和一種（對等的愛一，此片要旨，很足以明示現代人之父子倫理觀：就是父親應有慈愛的賜與，兒女才應答報以孝順；反之，父親對於兒女没有恩惠和慈愛，（例如不顧贍養的浪父，和幼遭遺棄的私生子等。）那末，縱然存有名分上的關繫，兒女盡孝的義務是没有必要性的。</p>
<p>基於此種觀點，我們可以説父子間的情感，純屬相互構成的，换言之，便是半由父慈，半由子孝，二者應有質量上的對等作用，才能綜合而成爲完整的融洽。可是人類間的情感是常生變易的，雙方不能維續着永永的均衡；在父子間，祇要某方的情感稍形淡减，便會使整個的關係發生缺陷；而使彼此心靈間暗打折扣。雖然，這種潛在着的（不滿），可以拿（容忍）來補濟，（例如我國古來以百忍爲治家箴訓，）但當内心的不滿超越於容忍程度以上，勢必在行爲上有所表示，於是雙方會不知不覺的生着隔閡，甚且會不知不覺的起着衝突。</p>
<p>尤其是思想方面的問題了：在這動盪的大時代，一切新的和舊的在一個極端矛盾的方式中尖鋭地邁進着；人類的思想，緊隨時輪的激轉而瞬息萬變；父子間由於年齡的關係，形成思想上的扦格，幾乎是不可避免的事。記得井上池一郎曾説：（一個父親和他的兒子終究間隔着二十年！）這話在現代我國，更爲切當。因爲在現實範疇下，縱然父子向着同一準的前進，但父親總是趕不上兒子的。而且父親站在自己的立塲上望着兒子，往往會發見許多缺憾；反之兒子從自己立塲望父親，也有不少的缺憾。這種思想上的不恊調，反應在行爲上，便會構成種種的糾紛：一切生存問題，處世問題，以及社交，婚媾，禮儀，習俗等問題，在在會使父子間滋生着正面的衝突；於是現代的家庭，在我國社會上便漸漸發生動摇了。</p>
<p>家庭的不穏固，會直接影響及於社會的不安定；爲了維護社會秩序，自應積極設法消弭此種父子間的思想糾紛。據井上池一郎的意見，認爲最能收得實效的消弭方法，惟有嚴格的提倡早婚制。他分析現代青年思想上的不寗定，以性的不壓足爲重大基因；一旦擁有妻孥，立刻會變成穏健的老成者；而父子間種種隔閡，可由早婚來消滅於無形。井上的主張具有深湛的學理根據，自非高唱（早婚之害）的淺見者所能望其項背。不過此種辦法，未免倚重於父親方面，在實際上似未能適中肯綮。（當然在理論上是值得特别注意的，有機會筆者擬另爲專文商榷之）而爲了要不偏頗的顧念着雙方起見，我覺得除了雙方（遷就）以外，是無别良策的。</p>
<p>可是誰應該遷就誰呢？這又是很難説的。在父親方面：認爲人生處世首重實際經騐，年事加長閲歷才能增多；少年血氣未定，理智殊不易克制情感，必需由穏健者導之於正鵠，才不致悞入歧途，而在兒子方面：覺得現代社會是隨着時代激進的，在新陳過渡中，稍一躊躇，卽便落伍；老年人思想方面，總未免接受若干舊的影響，有了先入之見，好似纏小的脚，是無法放大成爲天足的。青年入世較淺，不致蒙受任何外緣的惡化或腐化，所以在思想上易於握定準確的時代意識。這兩方面的主張，都具有相當理由的。但是我人試以客觀目光衡定一下：應該怎樣的取遺呢？或者用什麽方法可使這兩種極端的見解彼此妥恊呢？這却是一個很有趣而又值得注意的問題了。在此，筆者個人的結論擬暫緩發表，希望聰敏的讀者們能給牠一個中肯的論斷。</p>
<h3>異國的孩子們</h3>
<p>— 永泊</p>
<p>四週是日本風，日本味，自然更多的是日本人。</p>
<p>彷彿霞飛路是法國人區域，靜安寺路是英國人區域，－此地乃是日本人區域。</p>
<p>而且法人區域英人區域是不純粹的，譬如霞飛路便多俄國人，葡萄牙人，西班牙人夾雜其間；靜安寺路也儘有美國人，德國人，意大利人居住着。可是日人區域就只住有日本人，連朝鮮人住在一起的也極少。－除了我們這可憐的主人！中國人！</p>
<p>在日人區域中住了下來，已經有半年多了。可是我對他們那些似謙恭而又倨傲的男子却並無興趣，凶惡的老太婆和嫵媚的少婦也一樣。我所最最感到興趣的，到是那些經常在衖堂裏跳跳閙閙的孩子們。我密切地注視着他們，研究着他們的一舉一動，以及體格智慧之類，看他們將來還會像父兄們不？看他們將來對待人家，能否改掉一點桀梟的本性？</p>
<p>觀察的結果我又滿意，又危懼，所發見的超過了我的預定多多。第一，他們朝晨晚間都，唱着一種類於軍歌的歌，可見他們對於尚武精神在無形中所接受的影響。第二，他們對中國人的態度是非常壞的，你在走路他在狂奔時撞了你，他反而會駡你，對你做着凶惡的姿勢，這可見他們在小時候已養成了賤視華人的心理。第三。第們報復的手假也是高人一等的。有一次，因日本孩子在我們後樓抛上了泥塊，房東去告訴了他們的家長，于是便遭了打；但那孩子竟懷恨在心，乘間用柏油攪和了泥土，來把後門上的司撥靈鎖的隙縫塞滿了。于是，把鑰匙硬揷進去，一撥，斷了－第二個人不留意，也同樣斷了。這使房東不能不拆開來修理，結果還掉了兩隻螺絲，埋怨不已！</p>
<p>他們知道柏油有莫大的黏性，爛泥極有阻塞的功用，于是便把來完成了惡作劇的報復行爲了。我雖然也討厭他們那樣胡閙，但却很佩服他們的富有科學知識。在這種地方，我們中國的孩子們是不免相形見拙的。</p>
<p>近來是暑假，那些男女孩們愛在衖堂裏做着種類於　的遊戲，羊金－崩！羊金－崩－齊聲喊着，并且用手揮着；我不諳日語，所以也不清楚他們在搗些什麽鬼，但從態度上看去，却似乎是一種興奮或是鼓勵的呐喊．同時，在呐喊的一羣之外，也還有兩個在衖堂口競走着。這又可見日本孩子的自由游戲也已帶了點規則化了。</p>
<p>他們都是和尚頭，腿特别粗壯，那種活潑的精神，强健的體格，樸實的風氣，我們是無可非議的。主要的是我們中國的孩子們能否馬上也能因教育的改進而活潑起來，强健起來，樸實起來，將來去抵禦他們那些侵略的後輩，－解進而活潑起來，强健起來，樸實起來，將來去抵禦他們那些侵略的後輩，－解决我們未來的大患！</p>
<p>（十年生聚，十年教訓，）我們弱國倒没下那種工夫，正相反，爲强國的日本却先在那里下了！言念及此，能不興歎？</p>
<h3>大家知道的事</h3>
<p>— 風</p>
<p>人影在脚底下踐踏，將近中午了。他匆匆忙忙擦過每個人的肩頭向歸家的路上走，兩件綢單掛完全滲透了汗績；額角上的更從兩頰流到嘴角邊。一塊烏黄的絹帕雖緊握在他的掌中，他的心因爲記掛着妻陰沉的臉，無閑拭揩那些將要流向𩓐子裏去的汗珠。</p>
<p>一條馬路又一條馬路，在那所紅牆的大洋房邊他轉進側弄，遠遠的瞧見妻向這邊瞧望，他脚裏更緊走幾步，妻也慢慢的迎上來。在第二個人家的門前他們對立了，妻抓住了他的手臂連連震着問：（成功嗎？）他點點頭，把緊握的烏黄絹帕包一揚，妻纔微笑着告訴他那個常來的王先生等在家裏幾個鐘頭了。他忙從絹帕中抽出一張五元的鈔票遞給妻，（快去糴米，多買一點小菜回來。）説罷跑進笔門去了。</p>
<p>客堂裏他的老友低着頭像瘋了似的來回的踱步，又像注視着地上的一件細小東西，他進門也没有聽見，呌了他名字才不知所措地（哈－晤）了半天。</p>
<p>（久等了，什麽時候來的？）</p>
<p>主人脱去長掛，從短掛，袋中掏出烟盒授一枝客人。讓座了問。</p>
<p>（剛來－有一會了。）客人説後主自己更正。</p>
<p>（那邊還是没有消息？）</p>
<p>（找他的人多哩，有什麽辦法！）</p>
<p>客人氣憤憤地抽着烟。</p>
<p>客堂裏寂靜了，可以聽見蒼蠅嗡嗡的飛來飛去。</p>
<p>妻的影子在門背後探頭探腦，他走過去時候好低低的問：</p>
<p>（王先生吃飯嗎？）</p>
<p>（這時候自然吃飯的！）</p>
<p>他大聲回答驚醒了客人的冥想。他馬上站起身來很快的回答：</p>
<p>（嫂子，别客氣，我要走了。）</p>
<p>（没有什麽事？這裏吃了飯去。）</p>
<p>（有一點小事。）吞吐的説着。</p>
<p>（吃了飯去罷。）</p>
<p>客人彷彿深思似的踱了幾小步（家去了，改日再來。）就向後門走去。</p>
<p>一個追上去，已到了門外。客人回頭來想回話，却是句（我去了。）</p>
<p>主人點點頭，跑回家來抓了桌上的烏黄絹帕包，在紅牆的大洋房邊追着了客，就把再有一張五元的鈔票塞到他手裏。</p>
<p>（先拿去用罷。過一天我來看你。）</p>
<p>（我－不－）</p>
<p>兩雙手推讓了半嚮，客人感激的説：（改日還你，我去了。）</p>
<p>（再會。）望着那了瘦長的影子消逝轉進側弄，妻在後門口等他。</p>

<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 堯</p>
<p>我們的國家曾經給别國的人民認爲是個病夫國，過去曾經博得了——東亞病夫——的雅號，别怒，這不是故意來侮辱自己，我們固當先問問自己，的確，我們的民族，是太不注重身格了，太忽視了人體的組織，太淡漠了生理外來細菌侵略，……。這較偏面的見解，雖在某一時間是存在的，可是我們若詳加考究，還另有其他關係的建立，存在，决没有來得這樣地簡單。我們是殖民地的國家，正因爲是中次殖民地的國家——帝國主一切底剩餘推銷地——，整個地一切皆間接被帝國主義的資本家統治着，因此，我們大多數人民的康健，也爲了帝國主義的關係是被剝奪了：當然還有其他的原因，我們不談，這放在眼前的事實，我們總不能加以否認了。</p>
<p>病是一件最可憐最可悲的事情，無論何人見了生病者，卽是心如鐵石的人，他也會起見憐而表示同情的：在富於感情的人見了，那是更不必説。在（生老病死）的人生過程中，生死那祗有一回，没有什麽了不得，老，在人生的晚年開始嘗着，而并不甚長，只要一人生中心點存在，認人生是有義意的，這樣因而得了人生的興趣，老也不見得苦了。要算是病，那正利害，他能隨時光顧我們，從生到死没有那個能包不生病，小時和晚年和病的機會要算最多，在壯年比較少些，病是件痛苦的事，不但是關於具體的全部成某一部份發生妨礙、并且須帶連了個人的經濟，生了病當然要去請醫生來視察一下，否則，也許因某一部份的病而擴大到整個的全體組織，發生了意外，因此，病了是不得不請醫生來光顧的；在現社會請醫生可請不起啦，一請，起碼就要袁頭一番，外加服藥費，合起來那就要那幾袁頭了，就是在下層階級的工廠區域，請個最起碼的醫生，也非四毛錢不可，再加之服藥費用，最底限度，合計每次也要費一袁頭，生的病也不見得一次就能够看好，醫生又不是活仙人，看幾次不成問題？要化廢幾元，在資産階級當然不會成問題？他們的小孩因生病而化用了數百元或至於千餘元，那是常見的事，可是在下層階級的工人和農夫佣工以及小市民，那就要成問題了？以勞動換來的價值，免强底維持日常生活已不易，那裏有剩餘來充作醫藥費用呢？貧病，在現社會裏是常見到的事，你如果跑進下層階級底貧民屋參看一下，那就可以得到更多的事實。另一方面，有錢階級的浪廢，日益增加不已，這顯示了現社會的矛盾加連底暴露了現社會的缺點。</p>
<h3>案頭的花</h3>
<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>跑到朋友許的家裏，許正靜靜地坐在那裏看書。其實，這算不得家，攏總就是老許一個人，他自有他的家在鄉下，那地方有他的父親，母親，兄弟姊妹等等。這裏不過是他辦公以後，一個睡覺休息的地方而已。</p>
<p>（老許，好自在！）</p>
<p>老許趕緊立起來，和我握了一握手，我們的交情，見面是無所謂寒暄的。本來這些（老調）在年青人的觀念裏早就消滅了。這地方我是常來，一切的東西，此如床。椅子，桌子等，都是非常熟練，祗須用眼一掃，便完全了然於胸中了。今天在寫字檯的右角例外被我發現了一瓶花，正在幽幽地吐出它的香氣。</p>
<p>（老許，雅緻得很！）我指着那瓶花對他説。</p>
<p>（唔！無聊！）</p>
<p>（我很喜歡你這（無聊）的舉動呢）</p>
<p>自從那一回起，我覺到案頭擺一瓶花是的確有這個必要的，並且從老許口内聽來，一扎花從賣花嫗手内去買來不過化了十六至二十枚銅元，這些，自忖在經濟上還不至於發生影響。更凑趣的是一個朋友幾天前剛從蘇州來，送我的一瓶（松仁糖）將近吃完，我於是將僅餘的幾粒糖吃完了，那個六角長頸瓶兒洗凈了正可以當花瓶用，所以從那一天起，我的案頭也多了一瓶吐出它的幽幽的香氣的花了。</p>
<p>我買花素來不問名兒的，祗須覺得可愛，我就買來陳列在案頭。每天早上換過清水之後，我總頃向他端相幾分鐘，假使它的姿勢有不好的地方，我也隨手替它糾正。雖然我的寓所並不像老許一樣的時有人來，但我總是這樣做了。</p>
<p>第一次買的花是五色的，顔色非常的鮮艷，花瓣有點像飛的蝴蝶，與綠葉互相掩映，加之梗兒挺直，益能增加人的美感。但是没有四天，根上腐起來了，祇能擲向垃圾堆裏。第二次據説是香水花，揷在瓶裏婀娜有致，不時播送她的濃郁的香氣，但是五天後也因腐爛而發臭了。</p>
<p>於是我不再買花，我不再買花的理由，不是經濟的關係，不是怕手續的麻煩，也不是因爲她不能持久，實在是感到她喪失了她的固有的生命後的處理的困難。因爲在每次將她的殘軀葬向垃圾堆時，始終覺得不忍，心上有説不出來隠痛似的。</p>
<p>我已經覺悟到，花與人是没有兩樣的，不但不能隨意視玩物，稍加桎梏——譬如將花植在盆裏等——也是有碍生機的。</p>
<p>現在我的案頭已没有花的影子了，連盛花的瓶亦已藏過。但不知老許怎樣</p>
<h3>中國啞劇</h3>
<p>— 病鴛</p>
<p>（啞劇）是外國貨，在中國戲裏，尤其是舊式舞台上，可以説找不出一齣能够完全稱（啞劇）的。雖屬有幾齣戲中，祗用（表情）（身叚）（步法）代表言語，顧示事實，如（羣英會）中（蔣幹盜書）之類，但那也祇是一部份，仍不能稱做完全的（啞劇。）惟有在（玩燈）時節中的戲劇，都是絶對不開口的，牠在中國藝術之部裏，似乎可以歸納於啞劇一道咧！而且牠確具有自然之特殊風格。本來，這樣的組織，其意旨是在（燈）在（玩），並不在（唱）在（説。）青演的重心，也是用（身手腰腿脚），而不是用（嘴）。何况玩燈者，未必人人都能唱能説呢？於是中國啞劇，在玩燈集團裏，便有了歷史的成功，和特殊之風格，很值得我們追憶，欣賞。</p>
<p>表演戲劇，在玩燈社會裏，昔日確有很大的勢力。因爲牠不僅是關於藝術，實還象徴着各地方的風俗。就我所知道的，其種類大約可分爲三大部份：一爲步行；一爲高蹺；一爲抬閣。步行，自然就是扮着戲劇中人物在地面上走。高蹺用木棍綁於腿上，有時特别高度，幾乎齊簷，至少也必（出人頭地）儼然和登台一樣，總之，無論遠近，務使觀衆的視綫達到，無所障碍，抬閣，是用兩根長的轎槓，抬着一個平面木質類乎半桌的東西，這就稱做閣。閣上佈着劇情中所需要的景緻，並不簡單。另外樹着極細的鐵柱，而將扮演者綁於柱上，或坐或立，也是遵循着劇情中最緊張的一幕而扮演的。不過不使觀衆得見鐵柱，祇見人物臨空，那才算有精彩，這不啻就是一座舞台。至於抬的人數，則視扮演者之多寡，劇情之繁簡，質量之輕重，而後定奪。</p>
<p>屬於這種玩燈戲劇，自然以抬閣爲最吃重，牠們的節目也不外乎皮簧劇常常在舞台上所搬演的。不過主角才有份，配角能否上閣，還有問題，或者在萬不能裁汰之中，有時也有一二個配角，憑空高踞其上，顧盼自雄！至於（龍套，）一那是無疑義的，永遠没有這個幸運</p>
<p>無論步行，高蹺，抬閣，在玩燈劇中，他們的支配，都具有舞台眼光。所以在每一行十幾齣戲，魚貫經過街頭時，我們總必看見（生旦凈丑）皆全，文武兩戲都有，這是何等有趣呢？我以爲現代之（露天舞台），（流動戲劇），何嘗不是師襲（燈劇）故智？可惜這個集團組織者，大半是另一社會之人物，其中絶對找不到一兩個戲劇家，或是藝術家，所以他們的組織不健全的。</p>

<h3>金銀㘭（二）</h3>
<p>— 季愚</p>
<p>是中午的時候，王四爺的堂屋裏，突然發出一陣騷動的聲音，接着又是嘩啦，嘩啦，彷彿什麽東西互相磅着的響聲。㘭上的人們，正當回家吃午飯，走過他們前的，帶着一種好奇的心兒湧到堂屋門口來，大家把視綫集中在堂屋正中的方桌週圍，上下。頓時明白了什麽地又散去了。</p>
<p>－操你媽，你把老子當做趕齋飯的討口子！一個三十來歲的瘦長個子，穿着軍服，坐在上席的，把桌上的絲瓜荳腐湯碗一推，砰的一聲，碗口撲在飯桌上，桌上的碗碟，有的給撞翻在地上，有的傾倒在桌面。綠蔭蔭的絲瓜湯好像没關緊的自來水龍頭樣，的的達達地順着桌子流，流過長木凳，落在地上。</p>
<p>－對不起，班長，今天因爲…因爲廟上打醮，禁屠…所以…所以買不着暈菜…班長，請高見些…－王四爺從側席彎身地站起來，兩隻手移了移桌上被震撼翻倒了的碗蝶，顫抖着聲兒解釋地，哀求地説。</p>
<p>在廚房裏的秀英，駭得躱在門邊偷張着堂屋裏的局面。靜寂中，只有她母親在床上發着乾癟的咳聲。</p>
<p>上席的班長，眼睛紅得快出火似的，氣冲冲地站起來，一隻手抓住自己坐的長凳子角兒使勁地朝後一摔，凳子砰硼一聲，四脚朝天，躺在堂屋左邊基角上。隨後，他抽身到右邊靠牆的長凳上坐下，撕開兩條腿，一隻脚在地上跥着，一隻脚踏在凳子上，低着頭，目不轉睛的地瞧着他面前的地上，好像要在那兒發現什麽似地。</p>
<p>坐下席的周甲長跟同班長一道來的那位兵士，一齊離開席。周甲長沿着堂屋兜個圈子，秀英見到他的影子，連忙縮了進去。甲長嚴肅地對王四爺擠擠眼，暗示他不要開口，他有辦法地踱到班長身邊，彎着身子，抱歉地説：</p>
<p>－唔，實在對不起班長，明塲請喝酒…這個，這個算我的…</p>
<p>説完話，掉頭瞟了一眼蹲在大門限上發怔的王四爺，又把嘴凑近班長耳朶邊，嘰哩咕嚕地説了什麽，班長一言不發地點點頭。甲長跟身走到大門邊，在王四爺膊子上拍了拍，王四爺跟着他往外走去。</p>
<p>堂屋裏，份外沉靜中，只裏屋的咳聲加緊着。</p>

<h3>好萊塢新進歌舞明星琪恩哈羅的勁敵</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>白金髮女郎琪恩哈羅有對手没有？從前或許没有，但是現在有了！現在好萊塢發現了一個新的金髮女郎，她的高射速度，竟和琪恩從前差不多，她並且還在繼續上升之中。這位新發現，就是愛麗絲·費（Alice　Faye）。她在好萊塢還是一個初進的演員，但她在（Scandals）片中，露了幾次臉之後，已經驚動了好萊塢一般老練的新聞記者，大家開始加以注意和調查了。他們説她的表演和琪恩哈羅極相似，恐怕將來會頂替哈羅的。</p>
<p>愛麗絲的頭髮，並不是白金色的，但是燦爛作黄金色的。那當然亦不難看，何况那頭髮又天然生就了許多小圈圈呢？她的面容呢，生得美麗極了，無怪乎人家説琪恩哈羅看見了她，夜裏覺都睡不着哩。她冷的時候，好像白塔油放在她嘴裏，都不會化的；但是她歡樂的時候……嘰……那副眼睛呀，眞不知有多少人爲她而喪魂失魄哩！綠油油好似一泓秋水，裏面充滿着一種不可思議的東西，大槪就是一般人所説的（性感）吧。有人拿愛麗絲和琪恩哈羅比較起來説她和琪恩極其相像，但是因爲她更年輕些，她或者比琪恩還要美。可是愛麗絲自己却説她不敢和琪恩哈羅相比。她説：（人家却説我像琪恩哈羅，公司裏亦那麽説，但是我却看不出來。我遇到過琪恩哈羅的，她是那麽温柔和美麗，實在是我及不到的。你瞧，她的鼻子是筆直的，但是我的鼻尖，有些向上橋的）。有人説，（其餘各部份，不是都差不多嗎）？愛麗絲説：（還有顴骨，我的比哈羅的高些）。由此一端，已經可見這位愛麗絲費多麽留心琪恩哈羅面貌上的一切了。</p>
<p>愛麗絲費的的確確是位百老匯的女兒。她是生在紐約，長在紐約的。她是以跳舞，不是以唱歌，最早受人注意的。她在紐約各處夜總會裏跳着舞，從來不唱歌的。但是她並不是没有唱歌的志願，不過她没有遇到名師加以操練，自然有些胆怯而已。後來她遇到了一位名歌家羅特范利的一位律師，他是知道愛麗絲富有歌喉的，他呌她化了二角五分錢，灌了一張自己唱的片子。那位律師就拿了那張片子，去摇給羅特范利聽。范利一聽，喜歡得很，這二角五分錢的留聲片子，就是愛麗絲費時來運轉的樞紐了。羅特范利立時就呌了她去，和她訂了合同，在無綫電台專唱歌。後來就被好萊鳱羅致了去了。她現在在狐狸公司裏，當一位歌舞演員。</p>
<p>她在離開百老匯而到好萊塢去的時候曾説：（我最崇拜的是紐約。我很不願意離開它。但是倘使我能够在電影裏成功的話，那當然亦是任何女子所日夜夢想的事了。我喜歡表演。我從前是位夜總會的舞女，而現在我被派的部份，亦都是歌女舞女的角色，於我是再相宜没有的了。至於念對白，我在拍攝第一張片子之前，我從來没有試過。這當然亦是我及不到琪恩哈羅的地方了……她念對白，不是從開始就會的嗎一？她説着她的一雙眼睛，又做着愛麗絲夢遊奇境的神氣。她那雙眼睛，正不知要使她得到多少帮助哩！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評（孽海遺恨）</h3>
<p>— 巽之</p>
<p>Frisco　Jenny－南京映－</p>
<p>以人情與法律之衝突，爲主題的（母與子）的悲劇，在過去的電影裏面，我們已經看過不少，所以這張（孽海遺恨），在題材上可以説是很俗套的。照例，在美國電影處理這樣的題材的時候，一方面是爲着維持法律的尊嚴，要將法律寫成公正無私而掩蔽這種上層建築的社會的基礎，他方面爲着投合市民階級的感傷氣分，又須用巧合，誤會，乃至不必要的自己犧牲，來强調所謂（母性愛）的偉大。以前在上海映過的Roberr　Florey導演Key　Francis主演的（五十六號的家），也就是這種型式的作品。</p>
<p>爲着兒子的（前程），母親犯了殺人的死罪，可是處理和論告這件案子的，恰巧是當了地方檢事的犯人的兒子。檢事不知她是自己的母親，所以根據她過去的行爲，而要求着最大限度的死刑，在母親，則爲着她孤子的（社會的地位），而甘受了列死刑的判斷。（孽海遺恨），去的行爲，而要求着最大限度的死刑，</p>
<p>在故事上没有别的特點，可是，對於不依從一切美國片的定型的（理圓主義），而用悲劇來結果，却不能不説是一個表示惠爾曼的理智的特徴。</p>
<p>這樣一個俗套的題材，和這樣一個年代化的冗漫的故事，可是這依舊構成了一部技巧上不很平凡的作品。這功績一半是在Wilson　Mizner和Robert　Lord的編劇，一半是在WilliamA.Wellman的導演，最初舊金山地震前的下等酒塲的雰圍氣的描寫，極端簡單經濟而自然的登塲人物的介紹，女主人公性格變遷的描寫，乃至中間十幾年之間的過程的省略法（這，也可以説是襲用了Capra在（苦纏綿）（Ｆorbiden中的手法），都證明了惠爾曼的堅實的手法，和對於叙述法的超越的才能，用播話之連續來構成故事的年代紀影片，要使之不成爲播話之堆積而能够緊密的把握每個播話的要點，這在編劇和導演上不是一件容易的事情。</p>
<p>在很少數的純粹的電影導演裏面，威爾曼和他的先進金維多（King　Vidor）與他的後輩略勃茲（Stephen　Roberts）之間，是有若干的相似性的，維多的素樸與恬澹，路勃茲的率直與眞摯，威爾曼的一種鋭敏而能够在一瞬一瞬間把握平常人所不能感覺的融覺，和他們三者之間共有的一種富於同情心的潤澤的情調。在泛濫的商業主義，和以色情趣味爲生命綫的美國導演裏面，這一些存在也像是值得珍重的了。</p>
<p>這是一九三二年製作的作品，在年代，這是遠在惠爾曼的幾部成功作品之前，將這看做惠爾曼的進步過程中的一個階叚，這不失爲一部值得注意的作品。</p>
<h3>評（凡爾登血戰）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Verdun——國泰</p>
<p>一部法國出品的宣傳帝國主義戰爭的影片。</p>
<p>各帝國主義間的備戰，已經成爲極顯著的事實由於最近陶爾斐斯的死，使歐洲各國間的矛盾和衝突，告訴我們大戰的爆發，隨時都有可能。特别是德國法西斯蒂的跋巵，震撼了凡爾賽體系迷夢，法國從第一次大戰中所獲得的所謂歐洲的覇權，卽使没有意大利在與之爭奪，而希特勒要求軍備平等，也不能不使其削弱了組織小恊約國之地位而極力注意於法西斯蒂歡迎戰爭之高速度的步驟。</p>
<p>非常明顯的，戰神又張開了兇惡的翅膀。在這戰爭與革命的週期中，不管是進攻蘇聨的戰爭也好，不管是帝國之間，重新分割殖民地市塲也好，第二次大戰終於是無可避免的而成爲决定意義的到來。而各帝國主義的用盡一切方法，宣傳組織本國的大衆，在救護祖國的口號之下去當砲灰，電影藝術便成爲他們最好的工具。關於這一點，任何帝國主義者，都在積極的使用這一武器，而法國的製作（凡爾登血戰）的影片，决不是特别的現象。</p>
<p>那末（凡爾登血戰）是在這種情形之下製作出來，於是作爲組織戰爭而出現的戰爭影片，自然不會揭發帝國主義大戰之眞象，而祗是以（德法交惡）爲口實，當作分割市塲，瓜分殖民地之眞因的掩飾，雖然德法間爭奪歐洲覇權，也成爲大戰的動力之一。誰是大戰的主使者，普朶敷金在（聖彼德之臨終）中説得好，前綫是千萬的勞苦大衆在流血犧牲，而後方的銀行家，企業家却在飲酒作樂，同時雷馬克的（西綫無戰事）也有着眞實的提供，當保爾自前綫歸來的時候，那些牧師和企業家們便極盡誘惑之能事。所謂爲了薩爾礦區，在爲了祖國之光榮營掩飾之下，要無辜的青年大衆爲他們當砲灰。</p>
<p>但是（凡爾登血戰）的作者Leom　Poirier却在一個教授對童子軍的説教中，説明法國軍在機關槍，大砲，毒瓦斯之下不斷的犧牲，乃是（爲國家而盡責任）。他帶領一羣孩子參觀凡爾登戰塲，回述大戰的經過。雖然他也説到大戰的殘酷，似乎帶了一點厭惡戰爭的成份，可是這是爲了説明當時作戰的難苦，那般被誘惑被壓迫驅上戰塲的戰士們，乃是爲了祖國之光榮而犧牲。何况每一個以戰爭爲題材的影片，當他們描寫戰爭的時候，他們是没有方法説明戰爭之不人道的。更進一步，那個教授在説教的企圖之下，正是爲了第二次戰爭的到來，驅使未死的人們去爲了鐵十字勛章而死去。</p>
<p>關於Leon　Poirier，在默片時代，未嘗不是一個頗有成績的電影作家，可是在聲片時代，他並不能獲得特殊的成功。在這一影片中，他並没有構成緊凑的故事，所以片斷的所謂歷史的紀載，使人們在機開槍大砲聲中感覺沉悶異常。這中間僅是每一個戰爭的畫面之聨接，其中雖也有些妻離子散，逃兵災，戀愛等塲面，不過在比重上那祗變成多餘的東西了。所以，在技術上也不能稱爲怎樣成功的作品。</p>

<h3>小娃娃（Baby　Take　A　Bow　（五）</h3>
<p>— 草時</p>
<p>一晚過去，到了明天，埃第與勞雷在細心檢讀着晨報的（招請職員）的廣告。凱出去給蕭麗買東西。孩子悶悶的望着她去了，就跑到街上去守着她。但願她的爸爸出來伴着她玩，但爸爸正在忙着。其時，一個男子匆匆走來。蕭麗奇怪地看他，她突然認識了，這男子是昨天同她談話的。（喂，先生，你昨天説送我的禮物呢？）她問。史東突然的站住，向四周迅捷的張望了一下。不見有人……他拉出一串閃耀的珠子，放在蕭麗的手裏。（這裏不是嗎？拿到樓上去玩……可不要丢了！）他説。蕭麗謝着，緊緊握住了珠子向樓上去了。那男子潛向弄中，不知去向了。蕭麗跑上樓梯，喊着她的爸爸道：（噲，爸，你猜猜我拿的什麽？）但她的爸不睬她。柔軟的嘴唇翹着，（我要你陪我玩）。但是她爸爸又抱她推開了道：（我没閑玩！）蕭麗道：（我把東西藏起來，你找！）她瞧埃第的口袋，輕輕的把珠子藏在裏面笑着走了。</p>
<p>餐室的門輕輕地打開，惠爾許走了進來。他冷冷的望着他倆，（我來搜查那珠子的）。埃第説道：（與我們何涉！）惠爾許道：（那珠子並没當去……又不會飛，唯一的答案是……在這裏！）埃第道：（假使你以爲在這裏，那末你搜查好了。）埃第站起來，舉着手，聽他來搜。惠爾許仲出手來，摸了一只口袋，就停住了説道：（你當我什麽人？你們有了亦不會藏在身上的。）他氣昻昻顧盼屋子，在四面搜尋着，咖啡壺裏呢，花瓶裏呢，桌子底下呢，都搜到了，可是一無所得。最後他怒喊道：（快説出來！珠子在那裏？）</p>
<p>從門口，送來蕭麗的高朗而清晰的聲音，（爸……你找着没有？）惠爾許對他們得意地奸笑着，抱着必勝的態度走向蕭麗，拿着一只奇樣的盒子，懷疑地望着他。（你是誰？）她問。惠爾許道：（你是父親的朋友……你瞧見過一串很好的珠子嗎）（你也來玩找東西嗎？）她問。惠爾許點着頭説：（是的，找東西。）蕭麗笑着道：（那末你去找啊！）惠爾許懷疑地站了起來道：（哦，跟你父親一樣的壞東西。）他忽然又瞧見蕭麗手中的盒子。他可怕地怒視着。（你這盒子裏是什麽？）。惠爾許再不裝着和氣的態度了他抓住了盒子……盒蓋飛開，一條長的青蛇被彈簧彈起來打着他的臉。蕭麗在狂笑。惠爾許臉紅了。</p>
<p>在外面埃第和勞雷笑着惠爾許的上當。忽然勞雷向他討火柴。桌上本來放着一只自來火的盒子，但他是受過可怕的教訓的，不敢去拿它。因此他向埃第索取，埃第於是伸手到他的口袋中……恐怖的表情發現在埃第的臉上。緩緩地，恐懼地，他縮回了他的手而凝視着手中的東西。（蕭麗……）他呶呶地迷亂地，不久，突然理解了，（是史東！）勞雷亦臉色慘白地凝視那閃耀的珠子。惠爾許的聲氣斬近。（假使你告訴我，我送你一大盒糖，）他在哄孩子。（未完）</p>

<h3>A Rumor: Huang May Descend Mountain Today to Meet Zhang Xueliang in Hankou</h3>
<p>Kuling: Huang Fu went to Chiang Kai-shek's residence again at 9:30 AM on the 16th for further discussions. There is still no definite date for his trip north. A reporter visited his residence at 9:00 AM for an interview. Mr. Huang stated first that since arriving in Kuling a week ago, he had only met with Chairman Chiang twice due to the latter's slight indisposition. Some issues still need to be discussed, so he will need to stay in Kuling for a considerable time. When the reporter asked whether he had dismissed the idea of resignation, Mr. Huang said that he had never formally submitted a letter of resignation to the central government since leaving Beiping, so there was no question of reinstatement. He continued that a year ago, he went to Beiping to take the position of Chairman of the Political Readjustment Council because the national crisis was severe and he was urged by all parties to make an effort to turn the tide. The guiding principle at that time was to adhere to the central government on the one hand and to assist the local authorities on the other. However, after a year of effort, he felt that it had not helped and was contrary to his original intention, so he came south. However, if the central government could now have something to adhere to and the local authorities could also be assisted, then it would not be impossible to go to Beiping again. When Mr. Huang talked about how to open up the situation in North China in the future, he said that this matter was very complicated and could not be explained in a few words. North China's diplomacy is not a unilateral issue, but a bilateral or even multilateral issue. If the people of the country can recognize the domestic situation, understand the international situation, appreciate the difficulties of the authorities, work together in harmony, and work together with one heart and one mind, the country can be based on a stable situation. Mr. Huang concluded by saying that he would leave Kuling only after finishing his meeting with Chiang, which would be in about a week or so. He would go to Nanjing first before going to Beiping, and Yin Tong would also go with him. His health has also recovered, only his stomach problems occasionally flare up when he is not careful with his diet. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Huang Fu is expected to descend the mountain on the 17th, take a ship to Hankou, meet Zhang Xueliang, and then go north. Zhang Qun may return with him. Zhang Zhizhong will come to Hankou on the 17th to visit Zhang. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, Huang Fu's resignation has been withdrawn. There are already ways to deal with North China's political and diplomatic affairs in the future. Only some procedural matters, such as partially taking over the war zone, still need to be discussed with Chiang. Huang will rest briefly in Lushan and then take a ship to Nanjing, transfer to a train, and return to the north to take office. The departure date is about the 20th. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yang Hucheng took the Changxing steamer to Jiangxi at 9:00 AM. According to him, he will stay in Lushan for a few days and then transfer to Nanjing. He will meet with Song Ziwen in Shanghai to discuss the development of the Northwest. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun is scheduled to leave Hankou for Fancheng on the morning of the 17th and then go to Yunyang to supervise the oath-taking ceremony for Guan Linzheng.

<h3>Song Ziwen Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>=Took the Train to Shanghai That Evening=</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the Economic Council, accompanied by secretaries Qin Yingchun, Chen Kangqi, and six guards, arrived in Nanjing from Jinan at noon on the 16th, and took a car back to his private residence in Beijige to rest. At 5:00 PM, he took the Jinghu train to Shanghai with Qin Yingchun and others. Song Yun said that he had met with the two ambassadors Yan and Gu in Qingdao, but only for ordinary talks. The date of my inspection in Sichuan has not yet been determined. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen, accompanied by Lu Wenlan, Xiang Jieren, etc., went south by special train at 2:00 PM on the 15th and arrived in Beijing at 11:30 AM on the 16th. He visited President Wang and discussed the affairs of the Economic Council, and summoned Qin Fen to inquire about the recent work of the Economic Council and gave instructions. At 5:00 PM on the 16th, Song and others took a fast train from Beijing to Shanghai. Song said to the reporter of the Central News Agency before leaving that he had a very good impression of the trip to Qingdao to escape the summer, and passed through Jinan on the way back. All the construction projects in Shandong Province are full of vigor, especially the yarn factory industry. The equipment of the Jinan Yarn Factory is very new, and all kinds of machines are of the 1934 style, so the products are excellent and better than the factories in Shanghai. At a time when the textile industry is sluggish and the factories in Shanghai are losing money, the Jinan Yarn Industry can actually make a profit, which shows that its management is effective. As for the US government's announcement of the nationalization of silver, I saw it reported in Qingdao, but I am not very clear about the situation in all aspects during the summer vacation, and I have no opinion for the time being. When I arrive in Shanghai, I will study it in detail with experts. Regarding the undertakings that the Economic Commission should carry out, I talked briefly with Qin Fen after arriving in Beijing today and gave instructions on everything, but they were all local events. Because the standing committee members of the association are not in Beijing, the standing committee meeting could not be held. In addition, the National Water Conservancy Commission will be established soon to discuss and reorganize. Whether I will enter Sichuan in the autumn is still undecided, and there is no plan to go to Jiangxi recently. After Song finished speaking, he inquired in detail about the drought and flood situation in various provinces, and his concern for the people's suffering was evident.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>America and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>According to a Havas dispatch from Geneva on the 14th, the U.S. government will appoint the current Minister to Switzerland, Wilson, as a special commissioner stationed at the League of Nations. Geneva insiders widely believe this move is a precursor to the United States joining the League. It is also said to be related to the Soviet Union's entry into the League in September.</p>
<p>Since this news broke, there have been no new developments. Whether the truth is as Havas says is hard to know. However, the increasing closeness between the United States and the League of Nations is becoming ever more evident. Recalling the history of the League of Nations, it is known that the organization of the League was largely due to the efforts of former U.S. Democratic leader President Wilson. This move should represent the ideals and will of the Democratic Party to some extent. Now, as the Democratic Party is in power in the United States, and the international situation is even more dangerous than before the signing of the peace treaty, President Roosevelt, in order to realize the long-cherished aspirations of his party for more than a decade and to maintain world peace, seems to have a tendency to join the League of Nations as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The reasons why the United States has not yet joined the League of Nations are complex and numerous. The fierce opposition between the Democratic and Republican parties is a major factor. Before Wilson went to Europe, it was the time of congressional elections. In order to ensure the freedom of his actions in Europe, Wilson advised the people to vote for the Democratic Party. Unexpectedly, this move gave the Republican Party a great excuse to attack. As a result of the election, the number of seats held by the Republican Party in both houses increased greatly. Wilson's move to seek congressional approval of the League of Nations Charter and the Treaty of Versailles was finally thwarted by Republican senators, and he died with regret. At the beginning of American independence, there was the so-called glorious policy of isolation. However, the country today cannot seek absolute detachment and isolation. This can also be seen from the measures taken by the Republican Party in the United States over the past decade or so. Although the Republican government has not formally participated in the League of Nations, it has never ignored the international cooperation projects promoted by the League, and there is a trend of informal and active participation. Initially, it was only willing to participate in health and labor conferences with no political overtones. Then, it participated in economic conferences. Finally, it participated in the disarmament conference.</p>
<h3>Another Large Group of Russian Staff Detained</h3>
<p>Russian Consul Protests Humiliation</p>
<p>Japanese Military Aircraft Crashes in Harbin</p>
<p>War Rumors Abound, People Panic</p>
<p>(Harbin) Twenty-nine Soviet Russian employees of the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway were detained today on suspicion of being Soviet Russian spies, including many engineers in important positions, as well as several women, resulting in intensified rumors of war between Japan and Russia. (Reuter's, 16th)</p>
<p>A dispatch from Boli reports that a large number of responsible personnel on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway have been arrested since late night on August 13. A total of 19 Soviet railway employees have been arrested, including station masters from important stations such as Yimianpo, Mataosi (transliteration), Hailin, and Suifenhe. According to those familiar with current affairs in Harbin, this arrest is the beginning of a far-reaching provocation, with the purpose of (proving) that the countless (bandit) attacks, the destruction of rails, the attacks on stations and residential areas of railway employees, (bandit) kidnappings of railway employees, and the abuse and destruction suffered by railway employees and their families for months, are all orchestrated by the railway employees themselves. According to reliable sources, this arrest is only the beginning of the matter, and dozens of Soviet railway employees will be arrested successively. At the same time, the Japanese military intends to implement martial law on the eastern section of the railway in order to actually seize it, and constantly increase pressure during the Chinese Eastern Railway sale negotiations. The above steps are all part of the progress of this plan (TASS, 15th).</p>
<p>Slavsky, the Consul-General of the Soviet Union in Harbin, was unreasonably humiliated by Kostomarov, the White Russian Director of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police Bureau of (Manchukuo). Acting Consul Levid has protested to the (Manchukuo) negotiator. When Slavsky took a special train to Moscow on official business, when the train passed Boketu Station, Kostomarov became drunk, shouted abuse, broke into Slavsky's compartment, and demanded that Slavsky hand over his documents. Slavsky immediately stepped into his compartment and took out his passport. At the same time, because his child was sleeping soundly in the compartment, he asked the police officer to stay in the corridor. Unexpectedly, Kostomarov refused his request and entered his residence, continuing to act inappropriately. After Slavsky presented his diplomatic passport and the official letter from the Manchukuo authorities promising protection for inspection, Kostomarov still maintained his arrogant and extremely rude attitude. The inappropriate behavior of the White Russian police officer towards Slavsky must have been for provocative purposes. The matter was eventually resolved due to Slavsky's composure and self-restraint, thus avoiding a greater dispute (TASS, 16th).</p>
<p>(Moscow) A prominent London newspaper carried a dispatch from Harbin, stating that several employees of the Soviet Consulate were arrested at Suifenhe Station for plotting to assassinate Manchukuo officials. After inquiries by TASS, it was confirmed that no employees of the Soviet Consulate in Suifenhe had been arrested. At the same time, the Harbin dispatch claiming that employees of the Soviet Consulate were involved in the conspiracy was obviously fabricated by unscrupulous elements in Harbin, as they have recently intensified their provocative actions to strain Japanese-Soviet relations (TASS, 15th).</p>
<p>(Harbin) The secretary of the Soviet Consulate in Heihe, Ximaguf, and Russian waterway officials and diplomatic officials were invited by the Manchukuo waterway officials to a banquet in Heihe on the night of the 13th. However, after the meeting, when Mr. Xi and the Russian officials were walking near a Japanese sake shop, Mr. Xi suddenly disappeared. The Russian Consulate was shocked and immediately instructed the Manchukuo officials and the Manchukuo police team to search for Mr. Xi's whereabouts. At the same time, they notified Paulte, the staff officer of the Russian officials. Japanese and Manchukuo military police are still continuing the search, but there is still no news. Also, Mr. Xi is the one who insulted Miyazaki, the head of the Japanese special service agency in Heihe, in the past. Therefore, the Japanese and Manchukuo relations are paying close attention to Mr. Xi's disappearance (Dentsu, 15th).</p>
<p>(Harbin) (Lifted News Embargo Today) In March of this year, a night watchman was killed in the office of the Japanese special service agency stationed in Boli. As a result of the search for the perpetrator, it was learned that it was part of a plan by anti-Japanese elements to attack the special service agency. Forty people were subsequently arrested, but their accomplices still had a plan to attack the special service agency again on July 8. According to the confession of their accomplices, the mastermind is indeed still in the Soviet Consulate General in Boli (Dentsu, 16th).</p>
<p>(Harbin) The war rumors in Suifenhe are obviously spreading westward. Today, news received here indicates that White Russians in Yimianpo are now selling their furniture and other items one after another and moving elsewhere. The selling price is only one-third of the original value, which is enough to show the panic of the people (Reuter's, 15th).</p>

<h3>Franco-Russian Alliance</h3>
<p>If the Eastern European Pact Fails</p>
<p>Unite to Resist Germany and Poland</p>
<p>(London) News from here today states that France and Russia may conclude a defensive military alliance in the middle of next month. The treaty will be named the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty. It is said that the treaty can be concluded after Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and French Foreign Minister Barthou go to Geneva together. It is also heard that the treaty is a condition for the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations. This news is considered credible by responsible diplomatic circles in London. However, France and Russia will only need to sign a bilateral treaty if Germany and Poland refuse to join the Eastern European Pact. The Associated Press also learned from reliable sources that Litvinov is currently on vacation in France and will go to Paris before the Disarmament Committee meeting to discuss everything with the French authorities. If two-thirds of the members of the League of Nations agree to invite the Soviet Union to discuss and accept one of the most important aspects of the current international situation, the Soviet Union will prepare to announce its acceptance. After the Soviet Union joins, the power of the League of Nations will be greatly increased. This is most welcomed by France, because the League of Nations has recently been repeatedly criticized for being unable to resolve international disputes, and France has almost no way to defend it. Moreover, after the Soviet Union joins the Executive Council of the League of Nations, France's proposal that disarmament issues should be handled by the League of Nations can also get Soviet support. It is said that the closeness between France and Russia indicates that Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations has removed the obstacle to the Soviet Union's entry. Moreover, France is deeply wary of German-Polish amity, so it is eager to win over the Soviet Union to confront them (National News Agency, 15th).</p>
<p>A Soviet air squadron from the capital of Czechoslovakia, led by Enschlit, the director of the Civil Aviation Bureau, arrived here after the New Year. It was originally scheduled to stay for one day and depart again tomorrow to return to its country. This plan has now been cancelled. The Soviet aviators will visit various Czech aircraft manufacturing plants. Enschlit will also go to Karlovy Vary, Mariánské Lázně, and Pilsen to visit the famous Škoda arms factory. The air squadron is now scheduled to depart for its home country on Friday morning. Czech newspapers have written articles expressing their welcome, especially pointing out that the Soviet air squadron is returning to Moscow via Paris and Prague. The route it has taken has a symbolic value (Havas, 15th).</p>
<h3>French Newspaper Discusses Japanese Deceit</h3>
<p>(Paris) (Quotidien) carries an article about the provocative methods used by Japanese imperialism in the negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway. The newspaper stated that (Manchukuo), under the direction of the Japanese, will definitely propose a lower price than the one quoted by the Soviet Union. In addition, in order to reduce the value and importance of the railway, it has used various means to transfer the freight of the Chinese Eastern Railway to the railway recently built by the Japanese. The newspaper concluded that (not only that, but the authorities have created all kinds of difficulties for the Soviet administration and railway employees) (TASS, 15th).</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Department Prepares to Build Another 25 Vessels</h3>
<p>Also Planning to Expand Air Force</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States' grand naval plan moved forward another step today. The Navy Department has prepared to build another 25 new vessels. Bids for the construction estimate were unsealed this morning. The vessels to be built are one heavy cruiser, three light cruisers, fifteen destroyers, and six submarines. This is part of Vincent's grand naval bill to build 102 new vessels. In addition to completing this vessel construction plan, the Navy Department is now also planning to expand its air force strength. Representative Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee and the proposer of the grand naval bill, has begun to carry out everything (National News Agency, 15th).</p>

The first batch of air force officers and mechanics have set off for the island. The British Navy originally had a base on the island. Recently, the Aviation Department decided to build an aviation base to provide a landing and refueling point for aircraft of the Antilles Fleet (Havas, 16th).</p>
<h3>Hindenburg's Political Testament Published</h3>
<p>Gradually Get Rid of Shackles</p>
<p>Deep Expectations for the Future of the Motherland</p>
<p>(Berlin) Chancellor and Führer Hitler has ordered the publication of the political instructions left by the late President General Hindenburg. This document seems likely to cause a political shock. The existence of this document was initially denied. It is now known that former Vice-Chancellor von Papen presented it to Hitler at the request of Hindenburg's son, Colonel Hindenburg. The document expresses regret over the political and economic instability of Germany and the deterioration of diplomatic relations, and asks (when will there be a pillar to save the German Emperor and this country in the midst of the stormy waves?). In a section continued on May 11, 1934, it reads (I thank God that I have lived to see the revival of Germany. My Chancellor Hitler and his movement have dissolved class divisions among the German people and made permanent unity and progress. I am now saying goodbye to the German people forever, and I hope that the expectations I held in 1919, and those that have gradually matured since then, will eventually fully try the mission of our people in history. I have this firm belief in the future of the motherland, and I can rest in peace). Also, the saying (when will there be a pillar to save the German Emperor and this country in the midst of the stormy waves?) was written in 1919. President Hindenburg clearly saw Hitler as this pillar. President Hindenburg's political instructions repeatedly urged German youth to be loyal to the country and not to disgrace their ancestors, and praised the national defense forces and those who participated in the reconstruction of Germany. It continued (Germany is the standard-bearer of Western civilization. In order to preserve Europe, it must be allowed to survive, and the world has not understood this for a long time. Now, if we want to get rid of the shackles imposed on us, we should do so gradually and without alarming the masses to rise up in resistance. Only then can we safely achieve this goal. If many of my old comrades cannot understand the importance of this procedure, then the national laws I have signed are necessary for the times and history will have its own evaluation) (Reuter's, 19th).</p>
<p>In Berlin, Germany, the political testament of the late President Hindenburg to the German people and the Chancellor was presented to Chancellor Hitler by Vice-Chancellor von Papen, representing Hindenburg's son, Colonel Hindenburg, tonight, and announced by Hitler. The opening paragraph of Hindenburg's will is a copy of a part of his (Last Words to the German People) written in 1919, as Hindenburg then had the intention of permanently withdrawing from politics. He said, (Modern political fanaticism is like a raging flood, and our past hatred for the country seems to have been submerged. The traditions that we once regarded as sacred also seem to have been completely destroyed. However, this trend will inevitably recede, and when the raging flood of national life has receded, a rock will reappear, which is the foundation of hope for our ancestors, and the place where the future of the motherland was laid fifty years ago, that is, the Kaiser Dynasty of Germany. When the national conscience awakens from the ashes of the Great War and the pain of the present day, it will be the time when moral fruits mature). A section of Hindenburg's will, dated May 11, 1934, also states, (The reason why I dared to accept the position of Head of State is that I firmly believed that the German people's national spirit and perseverance have an inexhaustible source. My later years were even more days of distress for me, because I had deeply realized that today's constitution and political system were adopted in times of extreme national hardship and internal emptiness, and in fact they were not in line with the true needs of the country and the qualities of our nation. In the future, there will always be a day when the entire nation will share my awareness, so I take it as my duty to lead the country out of the valleys of foreign oppression, domestic poverty, and national self-abasement, in order to wait for the resurgence of the country. I also feel that the symbol and support of national revival belong to the national defense forces, so no matter when, that army must be controlled and commanded by the supreme leader of the country, and must never be affected by any political trends and changes. This is also the supreme and unparalleled task of defending the motherland. Furthermore, in terms of international politics, the suffering of the German people is just beginning and has not ended. We are being stumbled under the heavy weight of the terrible treaty, and the pressure is increasing day by day. We must continue to move forward until we are exhausted and fall to the ground. Today, we can only move forward step by step with pain, without thinking about how difficult the obstacles are. Only then can we hope that our chains will be released one day. Among my former colleagues, if there are those who do not understand why this is the only way, they can examine the historical records to know that my policies are not wrong, and understand that I know the infinite pain felt by the people, and I have to sign various national documents with great effort). The final section of Hindenburg's will states (My Chancellor Hitler and his actions are a very important step in history, that is, to unite the people and unify them, and eliminate various class and status differences. I know that the work ahead is complicated. I sincerely hope that after the country is restored and unified, all factions in the motherland will be reconciled into one. I am now leaving the German people, but I hope that what I expected in 1911 and what was promoted by the January Revolution in 1933 can achieve satisfactory results in order to achieve the mission of the nation in history. I firmly believe that the future of the motherland will be saved, and I can also rest in peace) (National News Agency, 15th).</p>
<h3>Ex-Kaiser Overcome with Mixed Feelings</h3>
<p>According to sources close to the German ex-Kaiser in Doorn, the ex-Kaiser was overcome with mixed feelings upon hearing the political testament of the late President General Hindenburg. The ex-Kaiser believed that Germany could only restore its former prestige under the House of Hohenzollern. President Hindenburg's advocacy of restoration was in line with the ex-Kaiser's wishes, but part of the testament indicated that President Hindenburg was indeed in harmony with the current government, which the ex-Kaiser did not approve of. The ex-Kaiser now feels that Hitler will not be willing to give up his current position of power (Reuter's, 16th).</p>
<h3>Mussolini Orders Withdrawal of Troops Stationed on Austrian Border</h3>
<p>Result of Meeting with Starhemberg</p>
<p>When the Austrian Nazis rebelled in Rome, the Italian government sent 50,000 troops to station on the Austrian border. Today, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini ordered the immediate withdrawal of these troops, believing that the Austrian turmoil had passed and that Austria was now able to manage its internal affairs. The Italian Prime Minister's decision was likely the result of talks with Austrian Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg in Vostia at the end of last week. Some of the withdrawn troops will return to their original defenses, while others will be transferred to Bologna to participate in the army maneuvers starting on August 18 (Reuter's, 16th).</p>

<h3>Britain and France Allow Austria to Increase Military</h3>
<p>Italy Should Also Have No Objection</p>
<p>(Paris) Reports state that the British and French governments have accepted Austria's application and allowed it to maintain its army increase to 30,000 men as permitted last year. The British and French replies will be sent to Vienna in the next few days. Although the Italian government has not yet made a specific statement, it is heard that it will also follow suit (National News Agency, 16th).</p>
<p>(Paris) The signatory countries to the Treaty of Saint-Germain (the peace treaty with Austria after the European War) last year permitted the late Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss to increase the number of soldiers in the country's army from 22,000 to 30,000 for a period of one year. This measure was originally within the scope of the treaty. It has now been confirmed that the Austrian government, because the one-year term has expired, has requested the signatory countries to the treaty to approve an extension for one year. In view of the situation in Austria, the French government believes that extending the military increase for one year is quite justified. Moreover, this measure is still temporary in nature, so there is no objection. It has replied to the Austrian Chargé d'Affaires in France, expressing its approval (Havas, 16th).</p>
<h3>Papen Presents Credentials</h3>
<p>Austrian Government Takes Extremely Strict Precautions</p>
<p>Vienna The new German Minister to Austria, von Papen, presented his credentials to President Miklas at 12:05 p.m. today, which were formally accepted by the government. When Papen arrived here today, the Vienna authorities took very thorough precautions for his safety. Papen's plane arrived at the Aspen airport at 5:30 p.m. today. A few minutes before, all idlers had been driven out of the field, and only personnel from the German embassy were allowed to stay there to welcome him. Even newspaper reporters were not allowed to enter. After Papen got out of the plane, he immediately took a car to the German embassy. Special police protected the car on all sides, and armed motorcycles led the way. There were no incidents along the way. It is known that Papen was appointed as the Minister to Austria, and the Austrian cabinet accepted it last week, so the tension between Germany and Austria should be slightly eased (National News Agency, 15th).</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Textile Industry</h3>
<p>(TASS Moscow Dispatch, July 12) The Second Five-Year Plan stipulates that the construction of new factories must be close to the raw material producing areas and the places where their products are most needed. At present, the construction of large-scale textile factories in Central Asia, the Transcaucasus, and Siberia is in accordance with this principle. The Tashkent factory will produce 130 million meters of cotton cloth annually. The factory has 215,000 spindles and 6,670 looms, and requires 12,000 workers. The Baernaul factory has 200,000 spindles and 4,600 looms, and produces 86 million meters of cloth annually. The preliminary construction of three major factories is underway in Kherson in Ukraine, Khokand in Central Asia, and Tbilisi in the Transcaucasus. The Kherson factory will produce 100 million meters annually, the Khokand factory will be similar to the Tashkent factory, and the Tbilisi factory will produce 46 million meters of the best cotton cloth annually. The machinery for the above factories will be self-made by the Soviet Union's machine-building factories. In addition to building new factories, the old factories are also working hard. The Fergana factory originally had 20,000 spindles and will be expanded to 100,000 next year. The Ashgabat factory originally had 22,000 spindles and will be expanded to 40,000. The Angren and Leninhakand factories will be expanded. The former will have its spindles expanded from 66,000 to 100,000, and the latter will be expanded from 30,000 to 77,000.</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in America</h3>
<p>Estimated Losses of $500 Million - Roosevelt Strictly Forbids Profiteering - (Washington) The U.S. Department of Agriculture stated today that this year's drought in the United States is more severe than in any previous year. It is expected that various grain prices will be difficult to lower before late spring or early autumn next year, and the period of high meat prices may be longer than that of grain. The general food supply is not expected to be insufficient, but forage will be greatly reduced, so the meat supply in 1935 will decrease accordingly. (Reuters, 16th) (Washington) President Roosevelt issued a warning today, stating that profiteering from millions of disaster victims after the drought will not be tolerated. The Department of Agriculture is now monitoring food exchanges nationwide, and the government will promptly investigate illegal speculation and profiteering. The government is determined not to allow millions of disaster victims to be exploited by speculators to enrich their own pockets. The authorities have full power to stop harmful commodity speculation, and if necessary to protect public welfare, the President will exercise his power without hesitation. The losses from the western drought are estimated to be around $500 million, but the policies of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration have not been affected. In other words, officials of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration recently stated that the grain control plan will continue, with the President's support. (National Telegram, 15th) (Washington) Some people inquired of President Roosevelt about the food situation in the United States as a result of the drought. Today, President Roosevelt replied that there is sufficient food and no need to worry about shortages. Those who hoard and manipulate prices will be severely punished without leniency. This week, U.S. grain prices are the highest in two and a half years, rising 5.5% compared to last year's prices. (Reuters, 15th) (Washington) According to today's news, President Roosevelt is now considering purchasing forage from Canada to feed livestock in drought-stricken areas. Officials predict that if this plan is implemented, the import tax on forage may be halved or even waived. It is also reported that President Roosevelt has now approved a plan to regulate ordinary surplus harvests to accelerate the period of surplus harvest distribution by two years in order to relieve the drought.

<h3>Adopt Silver Standard</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Morning Post received news from Washington stating that the U.S. government plans to establish an international agreement advocating the adoption of the silver standard. It is reported that U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has decided to hold talks with representatives from Germany, France, Britain, Italy, and Japan. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>US-Russia Debt Negotiations</h3>
<p>Roosevelt will personally preside over the negotiations - (Washington) The White House officially announced today that President Roosevelt will personally participate in the ongoing US-Russia debt negotiations. After the release of this news, it is hoped that the difficulties encountered in the current negotiations will be resolved soon. According to this morning's government gazette, Secretary of State Hull is preparing to take a vacation, which will completely halt his debt negotiations with Soviet Ambassador Troyanovsky. It is reported that the negotiations were proceeding smoothly, but difficulties suddenly arose a few days ago. It is said that the differences of opinion between the two sides are far apart, and the American business and financial circles are very anxious about this. (National Telegram, 16th) US Recovery Administration</p>
<h3>Will Change to a Committee System</h3>
<p>(Washington) The proposal to change the U.S. Recovery Administration to a committee system was formally proposed today by its director, General Johnson. It is reported that the proposal will be discussed by a temporary executive committee convened by President Roosevelt. General Johnson stated that the development of the Recovery Administration has made individual management impossible. Because the initial stage has passed, the management period will begin. All issues of controlling various industries to fight against economic recession are very complex, far beyond the ability of one person. The existing advisory committee can be reorganized into a committee system. If the President intends to have him continue to serve, he is willing to serve as the chairman of the committee. Secretary of Commerce Roper also made a similar proposal today, namely, to form another committee to cooperate with the existing advisory committee to establish close ties between the Department of Commerce and the Recovery Administration, because there have been conflicts between the two agencies in recent months. (National Telegram, 15th) (Washington) General Johnson, Director of the National Recovery Administration, expects the National Recovery Administration to be established and placed under the control of a committee. In addition, an agency will be established to coordinate the work of the Recovery Administration and the Federal Trade Commission regarding antitrust laws. Mr. Johnson stated today that placing the National Recovery Administration under the control of a committee can be compared to an industrial association. He will draft this reorganization plan and submit it to President Roosevelt for review. He believes that the conflicts between the Federal Trade Commission and the National Recovery Administration can be resolved by managing competition laws. The Recovery Administration has a vast scope and complex affairs. He feels that he has not been able to handle it adequately. Even if a combination method can be used to reduce 500 industry regulations to 250, each industry regulation still needs experts to conduct research to ensure that the public is not oppressed. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>President of the US Federal Reserve Board Resigns</h3>
<p>(Washington) Black, the president of the Federal Reserve Board, resigned today and will resume his position as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Georgia. Mr. Black had only agreed to temporarily serve as president of the Federal Reserve Board last year at the special invitation of President Roosevelt. (Reuters, 15th) (Washington) After the resignation of Black, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, President Roosevelt appointed him to serve as a liaison between the government and national financial institutions to ensure close cooperation between the two parties. Mr. Black's task is (1) to explain the government's economic recovery plan to financial figures, (2) to explain the measures taken by the government, which were taken because of the prosperity of financial institutions, and financial institutions are able to cooperate with the government to implement a plan for the complete recovery of all industries because of this prosperity.

<h3>US Troops Completely Withdraw from Haiti</h3>
<p>Three hundred and fifty U.S. Marines continued to return home on transport ships from the capital of the Republic of Haiti today, marking the final batch of withdrawing U.S. troops. U.S. Marines had been stationed on the northern coast of Haiti for nineteen years. On August 7, 1933, the governments of the two countries concluded an agreement stipulating that the U.S. troops would be completely withdrawn by November 30 of this year. (Havas, 15th) (Washington) The last batch of 350 U.S. Marines withdrew from Haiti today. Haitian President Vincent telegraphed Roosevelt, stating that after the last batch of Marines from your country left for home, a moving farewell ceremony was held. He sent another telegram to your great President to express his and his government's gratitude to your President. Your President's implementation of a generous and good neighbor policy has liberated the nation of Haiti and deepened the friendly relations between the two countries, which is a cause for great celebration. U.S. Secretary of State Hull also telegraphed the Haitian government, stating that the U.S. Marines stationed in Haiti have completely withdrawn today. However, in accordance with the agreement signed by the United States and Haiti on August 7, 1933, after the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, a special team of U.S. officers will be stationed in Haiti, with the command partially controlled by U.S. officers. This team will remain until October 1, 1934. In addition, according to the August 1933 agreement, the original plan stipulated that the U.S. troops would begin to withdraw from October 1, 1934. When President Roosevelt passed through Haiti on July 5 of this year, President Vincent requested an earlier withdrawal, so the withdrawal was changed to begin on August 1. Secretary of State Hull explained the course of events in a telegram to the Haitian government. Hull also stated that after the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, all military supplies, ammunition, and food will be donated to the Haitian government. Hull's telegram also stated that the U.S. Navy has been stationed in Haiti for nearly 20 years and has fulfilled various obligations to the Haitian government and people without seeking to obtain benefits. It is deeply gratifying to withdraw from Haiti in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and friendship. It is hoped that the Haitian government and people will make progress from now on and that the country's fortunes will prosper. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Political Turmoil in Spain</h3>
<p>The current Spanish cabinet in Madrid was originally centered on the Catholic Party. The party now believes that the current cabinet's handling of the Basque and Catalan issues is too weak, so it announced that it would no longer support the government. As a result, political turmoil has arisen again. The Catholic Party declared that when Congress reconvenes on October 1, the party will not vote for a vote of confidence and is preparing to form a new government. (National Telegram, 16th) Former Prime Minister Bariá, leader of the Radical Democratic Party, plans to merge with the Radical Socialist Party, led by former Minister of Commerce Ordaz, to save the Republican government. The two parties also plan to unite with the Republican National Party, led by Norman, and reach a compromise with the leftist Republican Party of former Prime Minister Azaña in order to form a grand alliance of leftist parties. After its establishment, it will reach a compromise with leftist members of the Catalan province in Congress. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia and the Third International</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Although the Soviet Russian government has no formal relationship with the Third International, observers here believe that the meeting of the Third International in Moscow will cause difficulties for Soviet Russian officials. Although most Soviet Russian officials, both high and low, are enthusiastic communists, they regard the Third International as a sea monster that hinders Soviet Russia's diplomacy. Currently, Soviet Russia is conducting important negotiations with European countries. Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov particularly hopes to conclude Eastern European security pacts with France and other countries. Although the Third International has no direct relationship with the Soviet Russian external affairs, if past experience is any indication, the world revolution book published by the Seventh Congress of the Third International will likely reiterate the communist foundation of the Soviet Russian government. This is also acknowledged here. Therefore, the Soviet Russian government may solemnly declare that although the Third International is meeting in Moscow, the Soviet Russian government did not invite it. It is worth noting that the headquarters of the Third International in various parts of the world are all separated from Moscow, and the notices for future meetings are issued by the Humanité newspaper published in Paris, and not from Moscow. Soviet Russian newspapers that publish the notices do not mention the Third International headquarters here, but reprint them from Humanité. There is often a lack of clarity regarding Soviet Russia and the Third International. Although all-Russian communists are the most powerful members of the Third International, they are only one of the 58 groups. All-Russian communists contribute a great deal to the Third International, but as far as we can tell from our investigation, not a single penny from the Soviet Russian treasury has flowed into the Third International. The Soviet Russian government has always maintained its attitude of not being involved in the world revolution movement. However, Soviet Russian officials say that they participate in the work of the Third International only in a private capacity and not as representatives of the Soviet Russian government.

<h3>Soda Tax Must Continue to Be Collected</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance replied to the Soda Industry Association, saying that soda taxation is not uncommon in various countries and is different from the situation of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies, so it cannot be regarded as harsh and miscellaneous. In the draft Stamp Tax Law proposed this time, because it is specifically for stamp duty on certificates, the special stamp item for soda will be deleted in order to separately handle the factory unified tax. However, before the Stamp Tax Law is promulgated, it is not convenient to stop the collection in accordance with current regulations. (Special Dispatch, 16th) Shanghai Bank</p>
<h3>The Process of Piloting the Cattle Cooperative</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai Bank's Agricultural Cooperation Loan Department is piloting a cattle cooperative. The procedures for joining the cooperative are simple. Anyone who has cattle and has a certain ability to live can join the cooperative. The cooperative charter is that a group can be established with seven or more people, and a membership fee of five corners and a deposit of five yuan must be paid. Members who want to mortgage their cattle will be evaluated according to the size of the cattle, and the mortgage price will be between 20 yuan and 30 yuan. However, members must guarantee each other, and the principal must be repaid within six months. The interest rate must not exceed one cent and five mills. The mortgaged cattle will still be managed by the original owner, and must not be stolen or sold. However, the cattle cooperative is the first of its kind and has a small scope of implementation. There are only two established cooperatives. One is the Hushu Town in Jiangning County, which is handled by the Hushu Town Farmers' Mortgage Loan Office of the Cooperative. Since June, a total of 1,307 cattle have been mortgaged, and 13,329 yuan has been paid for mortgages. The other is the Shijiaji in Chuxian County, which is handled by the Shijiaji Agricultural Product Sales and Cooperative of the Bank. Only 62 cattle groups have been organized, and a total of 167 cattle have been mortgaged. It is heard that many places have requested the Bank to continue to run cattle cooperatives, but the Bank must consider the results of the existing cooperatives before deciding whether to continue.

<h3>Handles Ministry Affairs While on Vacation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since Gu Mengyu came north, although he is on vacation, he has never stopped handling ministry affairs. He is actively planning the railway construction scheduled for 1934, such as the construction of the Baotou-Ningxia Road, the rerouting of the PingSui Road, the reorganization of the PingHan Road, and the design of the Xilan Road. Gu has been carefully planning for the past month. It is heard that the construction cost of the Bao-Ning Road is estimated at 10 million yuan, and the funds are already secured. The rerouting of the PingSui Road is a fundamental plan for the road. According to engineering estimates, it will also require 10 million yuan. How to obtain these funds will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval after Gu returns to Beijing. The problem of reorganizing the PingHan Road was largely decided after Gu and Chen Yanjiong, the director of the road bureau, held a meeting. In terms of debt, it was decided to consolidate the debt. In terms of construction, priorities will be weighed and carried out separately. The Yellow River Railway Bridge project will be the first to start construction, around the beginning of winter. The construction of the Xilan Road will be planned in a holistic manner after Gu returns to Beijing. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>▲ Regarding the pre-market factors in New York today, the stable foundation of securities can be considered satisfactory. There is a general expectation that business will pick up in the autumn, suggesting that many major securities are worth buying at their current prices. However, an unfavorable factor is the weak buying interest, as traders seem to be waiting for new developments before expanding their transactions. After the opening of the securities market this morning, the market was stable with minimal fluctuations. Most securities experienced slight gains. General opinion suggests that any positive news will trigger a reaction in the securities market, but a major surge is not expected in the short term.

<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>Langxi Telegram to the Shanghai Shenbao: Our county of Langxi is currently suffering from an unprecedented drought. It has not rained for three months, and the crops have withered and died. The land is cracked and barren for miles, turning into red soil. Recently, rivers and wells have dried up, cutting off the source of drinking water. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are fleeing without a place to go, and starvation is rampant everywhere. Bark and roots are the only food available, and they are begging in groups all day long. Even water is hard to come by, and local order is in imminent danger. Officials and gentry have exhausted all means in planning relief efforts. In this dire situation, we implore you to provide urgent relief to prolong their lives. If, with Heaven's blessing, it rains in the early autumn, we further beseech you to allocate timely seeds to salvage even a small portion of the harvest. In addition to separate telegrams, we offer our heartfelt prayers. The Finance Committee and various legal entities of Langxi County, Anhui Province, respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>Yongkang Telegram to the Shanghai Shenbao: Yongkang is a mountainous county, with most of its arable land being terraced, except for a few flat areas along the streams. The geological composition is sandy soil, which is prone to leakage and difficult to retain water. In recent years, the rural economy has collapsed, and water conservancy has been neglected. Without favorable weather, the land turns into barren red soil. Since June 15th of this year, the scorching sun has been unrelenting, with no clouds to provide shade. It was precisely the time when the early rice was heading and the mid-season rice was forming embryos. Water wheels were exhausted, and not a drop could be obtained. The already headed seedlings were swept away by the drought. Fortunately, there was slight rain on July 19th and 20th, which was considered timely and nourished the embryos and ears. It was hoped that there would be some harvest. Unexpectedly, after the 22nd, the severe heat surpassed that of before, and the late rice suffered another fatal blow. There is no hope for even half a harvest of the main crop. Now, the land is cracked everywhere, and all crops are scorched. There is no way to plant miscellaneous grains, and the farmers' livelihood is cut off. The people are filled with sorrow. Yongkang has always been a region with bandits, and outlaws are multiplying, seizing the opportunity of the disaster to act out. If there are no measures to properly manage the aftermath, the local security in the autumn and winter will be a cause for concern. In addition to the association appealing and raising relief funds to provide assistance, we are compelled to implore your newspaper to show compassion for the disaster victims and advocate for them. May urgent appeals be met with timely relief, so that starving people who have no way to survive are not exploited by bandits. The disaster victims are suffering greatly, and the local area will be fortunate. Lu Gongwang, Chairman of the Yongkang County Second and Third Drought Relief Committee, kowtows. The Breach in Southern Hebei</p>
<h3>River Water Approaches Shandong Province</h3>
<p>- Officials and Residents of Puyang County Build Embankments to Defend - Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River breach at Jiugulu, Changyuan County, Southern Hebei, is widening daily. The water flows eastward along the old course of last year's breach. According to Puyang County Magistrate Zhang Guozhong, the water head has reached Liangmen Town in Puyang County. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, inspected the upstream area and stayed overnight in Taochengbu on the 13th. He also sent a telegram reporting the water situation after observing the area above Fan County on the 14th. The telegram stated: (To Han Jun, Chairman of the Jinan Provincial Government: I departed from Fan County this afternoon to inspect the upstream area. According to reports, the breach at Jiugulu Village has reached Liangmen, approximately 120 to 130 li from the upper border of our province. I will report further. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, kowtows.) In addition, Puyang County Magistrate Zhang Guozhong telegraphed the River Affairs Bureau, stating: (To Director Zhang: According to reports, the Yellow River breached at Jiugulu, Changyuan County, Hebei, with a width of ten zhang. The water flow has reached Liangmen Town in Puyang County, approximately eighty li from the county border. In addition to supervising the residents to build embankments for defense, I hereby report this. Zhang Guozhong, Magistrate of Puyang County, kowtows.)</p>
<p>As for the water level of the Yellow River within Shandong Province on the 14th: (Morning) Lisheng Village rose two inches, water level at 58.44 meters; Guanzhuang rose one centimeter, water level at 35.62 meters; Luokou rose eight centimeters, water level at 30.01 meters; Xiezizwan rose two inches, water level at 19.03 meters; Dama Village rose two inches and eight fen, water level at 14.38 meters. (Afternoon) Lisheng Village fell four centimeters, water level at 58.40 meters; Guanzhuang rose eight centimeters, water level at 35.70 meters; Luokou rose four centimeters, water level at 30.05 meters; Xiezizwan fell one inch, water level at 18.93 meters; Dama Village fell one inch and eight fen, water level at 14.20 meters. (14th) After the Changyuan Breach</p>
<h3>A Record of Inspection at Heigangkou</h3>
<p>The Main Current Divides into North and South Channels - Belonging to Heigang, Approximately Ten Li Long - Kaifeng Correspondence: At 3 PM on the 13th, the reporter accompanied Chen Ruzhen, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, to inspect Heigangkou. After leaving the north gate, we saw flourishing autumn crops and farmers engaged in harvesting sorghum. The car traveled for several miles and saw a dozen brick-carrying carts and many workers busy constructing a road to Liuyuankou. We arrived at the Southern Lower Branch Bureau and met Director Liu. He described in detail the bandit encounter of yesterday. After a brief rest, we continued upstream along the river, traveling through a forest of willows. Chen stated that three million willow trees have been planted in the past four years. Although the rent for land along the river has decreased from over 11,000 yuan to 7,000 yuan, replanting two million more trees will yield a profit of tens of millions in a few years, which is better than collecting rent. Other benefits need not be mentioned. Approaching Heigang, we saw an increasing amount of piled stone, but a scarcity of straw. When asked about this, Director Chen explained that although stone is expensive, it can be used steadily for decades, while straw only lasts for two years. In recent years, the Yellow River has rarely used straw. At the Heigang Lower Embankment, we learned that the water level had dropped by six inches compared to yesterday. Supervisors were instructing the workers to work on the embankment. Although this place is on the back side of the embankment, it has the potential to become dangerous. However, several fishermen were floating and working in the raging floodwaters, seemingly treading on dangerous ground as if it were flat land. Arriving at Heigang, the water level had dropped significantly compared to yesterday, but the roar of the water was still deafening. The main current has split into north and south channels. Whether it will return to the north or south will depend on further water level drops. The area belonging to Heigang is approximately ten li long. Inside the dike is the main current, and outside the dike are water pits. The water pits are higher than Kaifeng, and the main current is usually higher than the water pits. Once the water permeates the dike and there is no soil available for emergency repairs, the water will flood Kaifeng like a runaway torrent. However, the stone structures built by the stonemasons are quite good, and dangerous areas will be transformed into the back side of the embankment, preventing accidents. In Henan Province, some dangerous sections of the river dike are thirty meters wide, while stable sections are at least ten meters wide. The new dikes built in Hebei Province are only seven meters wide, making them easily breached. When asked about the treatment of flood control soldiers, it was learned that the first class received eight yuan, and the second class received six yuan, without meals provided. The Henan River Affairs Bureau has six branch bureaus, including Shangnan, Xigan, Xibei, Dongqin and Xiqin, with a total of approximately 126 people, a reduction of three-fifths compared to 1927, which is insufficient. We then returned to Bianliang by car, arriving at 5:30 PM. (13th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Correspondence After Germany Announced Suspension of Foreign Debt Payments</h3>
<p>The Economic Situation Becomes Increasingly Precarious - England and the United States Devise Ways to Resist: Since Germany embarked on the path of recovery, despite being severely constrained by the Treaty of Versailles, military restrictions, and the pressure of huge reparations, its economic situation has still shown considerable improvement. The global economic panic of 1929 had the greatest impact on Germany. When US President Hoover announced a postponement of war debt reparations, although the German financial community felt the danger, its foreign trade was not yet severely deteriorated. At that time (December 1931), the cash reserves of the Deutsche Bank were 228.4 million marks, and foreign currency reserves were still 18.1 million marks. After the spring of this year, it gradually decreased. By June 15, its cash reserves were only 94 million marks, and foreign currency reserves were only 6 million marks, totaling only 100 million marks, accounting for only 2.9% of the 348.5 million marks in banknotes issued. Looking back at 1933, the total gold reserves for the same period were 34.9 million marks, and in 1932, they were 95.8 million marks. This is a shocking and dangerous situation. In the past, although the German financial community was extremely distressed, its foreign trade continued to improve, so it was still considered a relatively advantageous country among European countries. Since Hitler came to power, trade with the Soviet Union has gradually declined, and other countries have strived to build tariff barriers and implement group economies, which has greatly hindered the export of German products. In January of this year, the export surplus of the past four years suddenly turned into an import surplus. In March alone, there was an export surplus of 3 million marks, and every month thereafter continued to show an import surplus. In the first half of this year, imports totaled 231.2 million marks, and exports totaled 208.85 million marks, resulting in an import surplus of 22.7 million marks. In the same period last year, exports totaled 237.8 million marks, with an export surplus of 29.1 million. In the first half of the year before last, exports totaled 292.7 million, with an export surplus of 54 million marks.</p>
<p>The reason for the deterioration of Germany's trade in the first half of this year is naturally the global economic downturn, but the dramatic increase in German imports, which formed a decrease in exports, is also an important factor. The reason for the increase in imports is that domestic industry is active and needs to purchase a large number of raw materials. The government wants to control the economy and prevent the deterioration of export trade, so it imposes stricter restrictions on imports, but unexpectedly, this has caused exports to decrease even more. The trade deficit has not improved in the slightest.</p>
<p>From exports of 237.8 million marks in the first half of last year to a reduction to 208.85 million marks this year, because 78% of Germany's exports are completely manufactured goods, 400,000 technicians have been laid off and are unemployed. Another factor in the decline of its export trade is the decline in trade with the Soviet Union. In 1932, exports to the Soviet Union totaled 62.6 million marks. In 1933, it was only 28.2 million marks. This year, as a result of Hitler's implementation of anti-Soviet policies, the trend of reduced trade has become increasingly severe. In the spring of this year, exports to the Soviet Union were only 21.1 million marks. Even if Germany and the Soviet Union no longer deteriorate, it is unlikely to recover immediately. If this continues, it may decrease by more than 70%.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>However, Prime Minister Hitler does not care about these things and seems to view economics as less important than politics. So, he is still working hard to build the Third Reich, and on June 14th of this year, he announced the suspension of foreign debt payments. In fact, Germany's cash reserves have indeed reached an unprecedented crisis. The general public is naturally uneasy and feels the danger of economic life, and financial capitalists are also shaken. Moreover, after the announcement of the suspension of foreign debt payments, the United Kingdom plans to use the (exchange system) to resist, withholding the price of British imports of German goods to create a debt repayment fund. Other countries such as the United States and France are studying countermeasures. It is not known whether it can be implemented, but it damages Germany's international credit and gradually loses its previous vibrant fighting spirit within the country, falling into decline. For example, the paper industry has shrunk by 25% to 30%. Now, apart from blind obstinacy, there seems to be nothing else. (July 12th)</p>
<h3>Progress of Military Suppression of Bandits in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Attack Suburbs and Flee in Disarray - A Large-Scale Suppression Will Eradicate Them Completely - Fuzhou Correspondence: The red bandits who harassed Baisha on the western route of the provincial capital, after being attacked by the National Army, fled through Dahu to the mountains on the northern route. It is now known that this group of bandits, led by Luo Binghui and Qian Yuguang, numbers approximately 3,000. They wear short pants and shirts of blue or black cloth. Their weapons are of mixed types, and ammunition is scarce. On the 8th, they dispatched several small teams from Beiling to seize the hills of Bijia, Lianhua, and Wangfeng in the suburbs, hoping to spy on the provincial capital. After the National Army launched an encirclement and suppression, and the planes bombed them heavily, the bandits suffered heavy casualties. On the evening of the 8th, they abandoned the hills and retreated to Beiling. On the 9th, the National Army advanced from outside the north gate to the foot of Beiling and continued to coordinate with the planes for bombing. The bandits then fled from Beiling towards Lianjiang County. The National Army guarded Beiling, awaiting the advance of troops from Luoyuan. Unexpectedly, on the 10th, the bandits circled back from Taoyuanxiwan, under the jurisdiction of Lianjiang County, and invaded the Jianghu Shengyang area on the eastern route of the provincial capital. They were discovered by the local garrison, who immediately launched a brave and fierce attack. The bandits stubbornly resisted. From noon to night, the bandits suffered heavy losses from the National Army's artillery bombardment. At dawn, they retreated in disarray. Currently, the bandits in Minjiang, those on the west bank have mostly retreated into Youxi, planning to contact the bandits in Datian. Those on the east bank have fled to Lianjiang, planning to contact the bandits in Luoyuan, attempting a final struggle. The military authorities have decided to launch a large-scale suppression to completely eradicate the Luo and Peng bandit groups and eliminate future troubles. (August 11) Yin Rugeng Talks</p>
<h3>Various Negotiations in the War Zone</h3>
<p>Malan Pass to be Recovered in Early Next Month - Yutian Security Team Awaits Reorganization - Tianjin Correspondence: Yin Rugeng arrived in Tianjin from Beiping on the evening of the 10th. On the morning of the 11th, he visited Yu Xuezhong at the Provincial Government to discuss the takeover of Malan Pass and the reorganization of the Yutian Security Team. He will stay in Tianjin for a few more days before returning to Beiping to continue negotiations with Japanese Military Attaché Chayama regarding the Malan Pass incident. According to Yin, "There are no fundamental problems with the takeover of Malan Pass. However, there are still difficulties in implementation that need to be investigated. Therefore, before the takeover, I must go with Chayama to take a look together. Currently, there has been continuous rain in northern Hebei, and all the rivers are overflowing. The roads from Beiping and Tianjin to Malan Pass are all muddy and impassable in a short time. I can only go after the water recedes and transportation is slightly restored. It is expected that the takeover can be completed in early next month. All members of the Qing Mausoleum Preservation Committee have been appointed, except for the Qing representative, who has not yet been selected. Currently, Prince Tao and Prince Run of the Qing imperial family are discussing candidates. The formal establishment of the committee will be on the day of the Malan Pass takeover. Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese and puppet troops from Malan Pass and the preservation of the Qing Mausoleums, the puppet side has not proposed any conditions. In the future, three standing committee members will be responsible for protecting the mausoleums and will receive a monthly salary. Transportation between Gubeikou and Malan Pass is inconvenient. I plan to jointly submit a request to the Provincial Government with the Luanyu District to allocate funds to build two or three main traffic roads paved with stone to connect Gubeikou, Malan Pass, and other passes on the Great Wall, so that they are strong and durable. I have already convened a meeting in Beiping, and a representative from the Luanyu District attended. Everyone discussed the plan. The Yutian Home Guard Team has recently expanded privately again. Two months ago, it had been reduced to 1,200 men. Recently, it has privately recruited over 2,000 men. After Han Dianbang was dismissed from the position of Chief Captain, the acting Chief Captain, Sun Jizhou, is even more honest and easily deceived. The captains show no respect to Sun and have become difficult to control. This time, I came to Tianjin to ask the Provincial Government to thoroughly reorganize them. If this is not resolved quickly, there will be endless troubles. However, it is difficult to reorganize them because the unit is stationed in a non-armed area, which involves diplomatic issues. This must be determined after Chairman Huang returns and negotiates with the Japanese. Fortunately, Chairman Huang will be able to return to Beiping soon. Negotiations on the opening of a newly formed special operations team in the war zone have stalled recently. Chayama also has no ability to negotiate, so we will wait for Mr. Yin Tong to come back and discuss it further."</p>
<p>According to another investigation, the Japanese and puppet troops at Malan Pass have been continuously sending in many puppet troops, about a battalion, and Japanese soldiers, about 300 men, from Rehe Province. They are constantly conducting exercises with the Great Wall line as their target, and planes are also circling above Zunhua, Qian'an, and the Great Wall line, practicing flying skills. The houses occupied by the Japanese in the Malan Pass city have long been repaired, and there is also a rumor that the Qing Mausoleums will be repaired by a puppet organization in early September. Judging from all of this, Yin Rugeng's statement that the takeover will take place next month is likely not to be possible. (12th) Chiang Issues Order to Suppress Bandit Troops</p>
<h3>Intensify the Autumn Harvest Struggle</h3>
<p>Form Harvest Teams from Various Armies - Harvest Rice Outside the Blockade Line - Nanchang Correspondence: In order to cut off the Red Bandit's supplies and replenish our own food supply, Chairman Chiang has issued an order to all units suppressing bandits to intensify the autumn harvest struggle and harvest rice from the bandit areas outside the blockade line. After receiving the order, the troops stationed on each line have organized the local militia, local farmers, and refugees who have escaped from the bandit areas into harvest teams, fully protected by the military, to harvest the early rice planted by the Red Bandits. According to news from various sources, the Tax Police Corps stationed in Longgang Shanggu has formed a harvest team of 1,300 to 1,400 people, carrying sickles, baskets, and carrying poles, and stormed into Donggu, Liangcun, Nankeng, Xiongcen, and the areas bordering Ningdu and Xingguo to harvest rice. The 18th Army stationed in Guangchang has organized teams of farmers from Baishui Town and Toubei to follow the army to harvest early rice in the areas bordering Guangchang, Shicheng, and Ningdu, such as Liangyouyiqian and Hucenba and Dongshanba. Other units, such as the Peng and Wang divisions in Yongxin, and the Tang and Liang divisions in Yiyang and Hengfeng, have also organized harvest teams. This autumn harvest is to hasten the collapse of the Red Bandits. This year, various places have suffered from severe drought, but the rainfall in southern Jiangxi has been relatively even, so the early rice south of Longgang is quite abundant. Most of the fields in the bandit areas are cultivated by farmers who are forced to cultivate for the bandit army and puppet party and government personnel. Even if the farmers cultivate themselves, they are completely requisitioned and concentrated by the puppet village soviets and county soviets for military use. Therefore, the autumn harvest struggle will promote the collapse of the Red Bandits. As for the harvested grain, three-sixths will go to the farmers who harvest it, two-sixths will go to the local grain reserves, and one-sixth will go to the protecting troops.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang has also ordered all units to plant crops in the bandit areas, to avoid wasting them and to restore the productive capacity of the recovered areas. Farmers who participated in land redistribution will not be prosecuted and will be allowed to reform, so that they can cultivate the land with peace of mind. (August 12)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Corpse Disappears from Coffin - A man named Chen Huaxin from Fuyang, Zhejiang, came to Songjiang to visit his brother Chen Gen, who runs a business there. Suddenly, he fell ill and died. His brother bought a coffin and embalmed him, temporarily placing it on a barren ground near the northern side of the highway near Chao Guo Zou. Unexpectedly, last night, the coffin was stolen, and the body was taken away. The burial clothes and other items were discarded next to the coffin, and three rice dumplings were placed in the coffin. Those who saw it were shocked and spread the word, but no one knows the truth. One theory is that the family collected the bones for burial. Another theory is that it was stolen, but the purpose of the theft is deeply doubted.</p>
<h3>Robbery in Zhulu Township, Tinglin</h3>
<p>Gu Yiru, a moderately wealthy villager in Zhulu Township, Tinglin, was robbed by more than ten bandits on the evening of the 14th of this month. They carried pistols, iron rulers, flashlights, and candles, and tied up the younger brother and aunt of the homeowner. Then, they proceeded to search and loot. Unexpectedly, the younger brother took the opportunity to escape and informed the neighbors, who beat gongs to raise the alarm. The bandits did not dare to stay and fled with the stolen goods. After an inspection, the losses were estimated to be nearly a thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Nan Hui</h3>
<p>Major Bandit Xu Xinglou Killed Resisting Arrest: Major bandit Xu Xinglou of the Seventh District had repeatedly committed major kidnapping and robbery cases in this county, which had never been solved. The Xinchang Town security corps of the district had repeatedly offered rewards for his capture. However, due to the bandit's ferocity and cunning, he always managed to escape the net. Yesterday, the security corps of the town learned that the bandit had sneaked back to his home in Xu's house. They immediately coordinated with the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau and rushed there overnight to encircle and capture him. The bandit opened fire to resist arrest, and the corps police surrounded and returned fire, killing the bandit on the spot. A six-inch Browning pistol was found in his hand. His wife, Xu Xia, and his mistress, Liu Xiaomei, were also captured and sent to the silk mansion for review and handling, and a request was made to send someone to inspect the scene.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Residents of Hengjing Township Surround District Office: Due to the prolonged drought and lack of rain this year, the residents of Hengjing Township believed that a disaster was imminent, but the county government had not yet taken any relief measures. Yesterday (the 16th), about 400 to 500 farmers went to the district office to petition and surrounded the district office. District Chief Jin Xin immediately reported to the county government by telephone for instructions. County Magistrate Wu replied that the actual situation of the township had already been reported to the provincial government, and the provincial government would soon send personnel to Suzhou for inspection. District Chief Jin immediately relayed the above situation to the farmers, and they dispersed.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Thoroughly Investigates Soil Smuggling Case</h3>
<p>No. 54 Heng Street, inside Changmen, secretly housed a "Dongji Soil Shop" that privately sold opium. Five days ago, a large batch of opium was transported from Zhenjiang. When it arrived near Shuiguan Bridge, a group of men in short clothes suddenly rushed forward and seized about 500 taels. The Public Security Bureau learned of this incident and immediately sent detectives to investigate. It was discovered that the soil shop had been privately established for a long time. The robbery was initiated by Wang Guishan and Zhang Guangliang, who colluded with Shen Amao, nicknamed "Gunned Down Amao," Bian Bingzhu, Chen Hongsheng, Wang Ada, and others. As a result, the Shandong side paid 300 yuan to retrieve the soil. Chen Ziwei and three others each received 140 yuan, while the remaining eight people each received 100 yuan. Amao received 60 yuan alone. Bureau Chief Tu Bolin then issued an order to the relevant branch to investigate the matter thoroughly. Yesterday, they searched the Dongji Soil Shop in Heng Street, Changmen, and detained the landlady, Yan Xue. They also arrested Shen Tang, Amao's wife, Wang Guishan, Zhang Guangliang, and Bian Bingchun, and sent them to the main bureau for thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Mediates Electricity Dispute: Users of the Qishuyan Power Plant opposed the electricity deposit issue and expressed their opinions, sending letters to the Chamber of Commerce and unanimously protesting. They also planned to organize a user association to negotiate with the plant. The Chamber of Commerce believed that the Qishuyan plant and the users held conflicting opinions. To resolve the dispute, it was specially submitted to the joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday (the 15th) for open discussion to seek a solution. Representatives of electricity users, such as Sun Xixia, and representatives of the Qishuyan plant, Yang Huaigu, were invited to attend. The meeting began at 4:00 PM. Chairman Yang Hanxi first invited Qian Sunqing, Jiang Zhongliang, Sun Xixia, and others to express their opinions. Yang Huaigu then stated that what the Qishuyan plant had collected in the past was an electricity deposit, not a meter deposit. Before he finished speaking, Zhuang Zhongliang stood up and declared, "Please, Chairman, pay attention to my proposal. We should first determine the attitude of this meeting towards handling this case, and then determine whether there is a need to argue." Yang Huaigu believed that Jiang's interruption hindered his speech and immediately questioned him. The words of both sides were misunderstood, and a conflict was about to occur. The atmosphere at the meeting was tense to the extreme. After everyone present worked hard to explain, the situation gradually eased. Qian Sunqing then expressed three opinions: (1) The reason why electricity users often have disputes with the plant is that the plant often changes its regulations; (2) The plant should consider accepting user opinions and forwarding them to the Construction Committee for reference in order to gradually improve; (3) Lower-level staff of the power plant who have direct contact with users should be warned and restrained by the plant at any time. After discussion, it was decided to organize a review committee, and Qian Sunqing, Cai Yourong, Cheng Jingtang, Chen Zhanru, and Jiang Zhongliang were appointed as members, responsible for reviewing user opinions and completing the review before the 25th of this month. The Qishuyan plant will be notified to handle the matter according to the review results.</p>
<h3>Cook of Shanghai International Bookstore Flees with Embezzled Funds and is Arrested</h3>
<p>Liu Quanbao, a cook at the Shanghai International Bookstore on North Sichuan Road, was a native of Changcun. A month ago, Liu suddenly stole 965 yuan from the store and fled to Hangzhou. Unexpectedly, on the way to Hangzhou, he met a fellow villager, Hui Kui, who suddenly said, "Manager Hu Jiamo of the International Bookstore asked me to come and chase you. You should quickly return to Shanghai with me." Liu did not know that Hui was using deceptive words and believed him to be true, so he was panicked and handed over the remaining 830 yuan to Hui, asking him to return it to Mr. Hu to avoid further investigation. After Hui obtained the money by deception, he secretly returned to Wuxi. Later, Liu also returned to Wuxi, but his whereabouts had been discovered by Hu Jiamo. Hu tracked him down to Wuxi the day before yesterday and found Liu. Liu then told him the above situation. Hu went to Hui's house to search for him, but Hui Kui had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Hui's wife came forward and asked someone to mediate, first returning 430 yuan in cash to Hu and issuing a promissory note for 150 yuan. Hu refused to settle because there was still a shortage of 400 yuan and immediately twisted Liu Quan into the fifth branch station and sent him to the main bureau. He was transferred to the local branch court yesterday for handling according to law, and Hui Kui, who was on the run, was strictly arrested and brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Robbery Occurs in Suburbs at Dusk</h3>
<p>Gu Zhonghua, a bookkeeper at Longmao Rice Shop in Beitang, was over 40 years old and lived with his concubine, Wu, at No. 6 Houchang Street, Beizhakou, Guqiao, outside the North Gate. Wu was over the age of youthful beauty and loved to dress up, hiding treasures, which attracted the covetousness of bandits. Around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 15th), Wu was washing clothes when three bandits suddenly came, holding two pistols and aiming at Wu, warning her not to make a sound. They immediately grabbed a gold bracelet (weighing five qian and three fen) from Wu's left wrist and a red gemstone ring (weighing one qian) and a green gemstone ring (weighing two fen) from her fingers. Fortunately, Yu, the wife of tenant Nian Zhongxiong, saw the situation and opened the back door to call for help. The neighbors gathered immediately. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits immediately fled towards Sheqiaotou. By the time the detectives arrived, they had already disappeared. The estimated loss was about 100 yuan.</p>

As a result, the capital side paid 1,000 yuan to be distributed among the 18 dismissed workers, and the following was decided: 1. The factory will pay 50 yuan to the dismissed male workers and 20 yuan to the female workers as subsidies to show sympathy. 2. The factory shall not dismiss workers who remain in the factory except for illegal behavior or poor performance. 3. The dismissed workers should leave the Yingchang Match Factory immediately. 4. The wages that were owed in the past should be paid by the factory. After this mediation, a major wave was calmed down.</p>

<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Early Rice Enters the Market and Rice Prices Soar: Since the beginning of summer this year, the drought has been unusual and rainfall has been scarce, which has greatly affected the crops. However, the early rice harvest in the area of the county and the Li Xiahe area is very abundant and has already entered the market. Merchants from Xishan, Jiangxi, and other places come to Shaobo Town, which belongs to the county, to collect and transport them. Every day, there must be more than a thousand dan. Therefore, rice prices are especially high. High-quality rice costs more than ten yuan per dan, which is more than two yuan higher than two weeks ago. The worst rice also sells for more than eight yuan. The average poor people are all complaining bitterly.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain in Dongxiang, Boats Can Be Rowed on Flat Ground</h3>
<p>Due to the heavy rain on the 14th, the Yanzhang Township and Gao Hanzhuang area bordering Xingtai County in Dongxiang, Yangzhou, were flooded, and boats can be rowed on flat ground. Liu Sou and Shao Huai, who came to the city to pay grain from the township and Zhuang on the 15th, said that the rainfall in Taixian was heavy, reaching a foot on the 14th. The water depth in the city was two feet, and the whole city became a swamp. The residents of each household lived on wooden shelves. It was not until the morning of the 15th that it began to recede slightly.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>Public Security Third Bureau Intercepts Opium: Sanyang Town in this county is known for its opium pellets. Recently, after arresting and escorting Shi Wu, Lao Dada, Ju Yuan, and Wang Sanjie, the special commissioner's office slightly reduced their activities. However, Yutai and other families still secretly sell them. Inevitably, they are jealous of each other. On the morning of the 14th, the Third Bureau received a report that a large batch of opium was being sent from Jiangjia Town. Patrol Captain Chen Gongyu immediately dispatched police Zhang Huairen and others to guard the main road. At 8:00 AM, a man named Huang Laohu, carrying a bamboo basket, was captured at the archway. The basket contained a large piece of red soil, weighing 14 taels. He was taken to the bureau and interrogated. He confessed that he was sent by Chen Yuesong, the owner of Chen Maochang Store in Jiangjia Town, to Chen Penglin's house. The Chen family was immediately searched, and opium offenders Sun Mingren and Chen Penglin were captured, along with 18 opium tools. Chen confessed that "I am not afraid of Yutai's soil, so this happened. Yutai is still selling." After hearing the confession, the bureau chief personally led the police to search, but due to the leakage of information, no stolen goods were found. He has now prepared a document to send Huang Laohu and the other three, ten taels of opium, opium tools, etc., to the County Public Security Bureau for strict handling by the county.</p>
<h3>Tax Police Captain Dismissed Due to Case</h3>
<p>Captain Zhang Shaotang of the 29th Tax Police Team stationed in Jiangjia Town, this county, often violated regulations, used torture, and imposed arbitrary fines when handling salt cases. He also colluded with rogues Yan Longsheng and others to harass the countryside, causing unrest among the people. Last month, the district office reported that Yongping Township residents Shu Wencai and others reported that Yan and others were extorting and blackmailing them. After Yan was captured, the tax police heard about it and arrested Hua Kuangsheng, who had a grudge against Yan, and injured him with torture. Hua's wife, Xu, was extremely anxious and filed a complaint against Zhang and others to the superiors. The Tax Police Bureau sent Inspector Luo from the Fifth District of Jiangsu to investigate and verify the facts. The team leader was immediately dismissed, and the sub-district chief Zhong Guoqing will also leave. Hua Kuangsheng, Yan Longsheng, and others were transferred to the judiciary for handling. Later, after Chen Qixiong came forward to mediate, the Nantong Tax Police District Department transferred a letter to the county government to withdraw and release them.</p>
<h3>Owner of China-England Pharmacy Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>The China-England Pharmacy in this county and city was found to be trafficking in drugs. The special commissioner's office sent personnel to search it four times, and the owner, Pu Zhuping, was arrested and investigated. This has been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that after repeated interrogations by the military judge of the special commissioner's office, Pu Zhuping was sentenced to death and submitted to the Provincial Security Office and the Provincial Government for approval and execution. The family members of Pu heard this news and have made a final struggle to the superiors. It is unknown whether they can avoid the death penalty.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Court Seeks Fugitive Official: Hu Jinlong, a police officer from Yaogang, harbored soil smugglers. After being sentenced to life imprisonment by the court, Hu was held in the Public Security Bureau. Suddenly, it was heard that he had escaped. Chief Prosecutor Liu asked the Public Security Bureau for the person. Bureau Chief Fu Qianzhi replied to the court that after Hu Jinlong escaped, he had been approved by the provincial government for arrest. The court still needs to submit it to the High Court for approval.</p>
<h3>Apprentice's Disappearance Mystery in Dim Sum Shop</h3>
<p>Zhou Lianzhi's son, Jinhou, an apprentice in the dim sum shop opened by Gu Xuefu on Shizi Street in the city, suddenly disappeared. Zhou Lianzhi accused Gu of beating his son to death and burying his body in a desolate tomb north of the city. After interrogation by the prosecutor's office, Gu firmly denied it. The desolate tomb was excavated, but nothing was found. After a retrial on the 15th, Gu Nanfu was released on bail. The case will only be closed after Zhou Jinhou is found.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Bandits Rob and Burn the Victim: Zhang Dexi, a farmer living in a place about half a mile from Yigou Town in this county, was in a well-off family and had long been coveted by bandits. Last night, more than ten bandits suddenly came, each holding guns and knives, and broke into the house. They tied up the victim with ropes and set fire to his lower body, causing serious injuries. The bandits searched his house for a long time before escaping with their loot. The loss of gold, silver, jewelry, clothing, and cash was about 500 yuan, and many of his deeds were burned.</p>
<h3>Funing</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle Between Soldiers and Bandits in Dakou and Other Places: More than 200 bandits, including Du Xuexian, looted Sujiakou and other places and then occupied Dakou and Dawang. Huang Gongzheng, the head of the local security team, learned about it from the Huaibei tax police and Ding, the district chief of Chenjiagang. They immediately joined forces to encircle and suppress them. At noon yesterday, when the bandits were having a meal, they took them by surprise and went to encircle them. The bandits opened fire to resist, and the gunfire between the two sides did not stop. Suddenly, a heavy rain fell, and the bandits took the opportunity to flee far away. Twenty-eight male and female hostages were dropped. More than ten bandits were killed, two guns were obtained, and eight bandit heads were chopped off. Ten tax police soldiers were killed and two were injured.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Huge Amount Stolen from Farmers Bank: On the morning of the 10th, the Jiaxing County Farmers Bank discovered that more than 43,000 yuan had been stolen. It is now found that the bank has two safes, both of which were pried open. A total of 13,935 yuan in paper money, 404 yuan and 2 fen in cash were stolen. 1,700 yuan in paper money was deposited by the Jiaxing National Goods Company, 700 yuan in loans from the water pump, 800 yuan in paper money deposited by the president Wu Heshu, and 89 yuan and 2 jiao and 9 fen in the remaining cash in the general affairs section, totaling 43,124 yuan, 7 jiao, and 1 fen. Also, a package of gold, pearls, and jewelry (the exact amount is unknown) was deposited by a Tu surname. The investigation agency has now taken the bank employees Tu Haigen, Jiang Shiyuan, and Li Jinbao to the investigation for questioning. The police and the regiment are strictly investigating separately. The current president Wu Heshu has not only reported the details to the county but also requested that he be punished. After this case, people in society have been quite suspicious, because none of the bank employees usually live in the bank, and only workers are left to guard it, which is his fault. Wu, the president, deserves it. It is also learned that the bank's fund and capital are entirely collected from farmers, so a certain farmers association has petitioned the authorities to investigate the news.</p>

<h3>Urging the Conclusion of the Sino-French-Vietnamese Treaty</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce wired the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, saying, "We have just received a joint letter from the Vietnam Southern Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Overseas Chinese Merchants in Vietnam for Promoting the Research of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty, requesting that it be forwarded to urge the conclusion of the Sino-French-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. Except for the original text, which has been submitted by the Association, etc., and is exempted from redundancy, the end of the letter reads, 'Since the expiration of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty in the 18th year, the new treaty has not been concluded so far. Chinese goods to Vietnam have no treaty provisions, and the tax rate has increased dozens of times. Within these five years, Chinese goods such as silk embroidery have almost disappeared, and overseas Chinese industry and commerce have mostly gone bankrupt. If the new treaty is not urgently concluded, overseas Chinese will not be able to stand in Vietnam. It is requested that your association forward the letter to urge the matter.' Approving this, after the expiration of the Sino-French-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty, the Association has repeatedly wired the Ministry in the 18th and 22nd years, requesting that the new treaty be quickly renewed. It has been five years since, and it is still pending, resulting in the gradual bankruptcy of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, and the gradual reduction of Chinese goods to Vietnam. If we do not take urgent measures and conclude the new treaty in the shortest period of time, then Chinese goods will inevitably disappear in Vietnam, and overseas Chinese will not be able to stand in Vietnam. Approving the former reason, we should earnestly telegram the Ministry for verification, requesting that the country be consulted and that the Sino-French-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty be concluded in the shortest period of time to protect overseas Chinese merchants, and to restore business, which is very urgent. Chairman of the Chinese Federation of Chambers of Commerce Lin Kanghou knocks on the seal. The Executive Yuan replied to the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Advocating the Use of Domestic Pens and Ink</h3>
<p>Foreign Goods Shall Not Be Used Except for Drawing: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a resolution of the members' representatives to the Executive Yuan, ordering all agencies, schools, and organizations to use domestic pens and ink. It has now received a reply from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, saying that the case has been reviewed jointly by the three ministries of education, industry, and internal affairs, that the purchase of office supplies should give priority to domestic goods, and that the regulations on the use of domestic goods by civil servants have been stipulated and are being supervised by the committee for the use of domestic goods by various agencies. Pens and ink are cultural daily necessities and are a large consumption. Except for special drawing purposes, where foreign goods must be used, domestic goods should be used as much as possible. The three ministries have reviewed and issued orders to the subordinate agencies to comply with them. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, etc., should be informed accordingly. For the first half of this year,</p>
<h3>China's Exports to the United States</h3>
<p>Totaled US$24,261,155: According to the statistics reported by the U.S. Consulates in various ports in China and published by the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai, China's total exports to the United States, excluding Hong Kong, in the first half of this year totaled US$24,261,155. China's total exports to China in June accounted for 3,039,906 yuan. The amount of silver transported from China to the United States in the same month was 2,167,965 ounces, worth US$369,965.

Textiles ranked second, totaling US$6,254,405, of which US$722,707 was in June. In June, inedible plant products ranked second, totaling US$808,070. The total value of this type of goods transported to the United States in the first half of the year ranked third, amounting to US$3,590,082. The Japanese government</p>
<h3>Purchases Dentsu and Nihon News Alliance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Daily News stated that after the proposal of Shiratori, the director of the information department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese News Alliance (i.e., Nihon News Alliance) and the Japanese Telegraph Communication (i.e., Dentsu) negotiated more than ten times between the government authorities and the executives of the two companies, but they could not be realized due to various reasons. This time, after the establishment of the Okada Cabinet, the consultation on the contract method was started again. On the 2nd of this month, the joint special envoy Iwashimizu and Prime Minister Okada and Foreign Minister Hirota negotiated the results, and the contract conditions have been established. It is scheduled to be signed at the end of this month, that is, the government will spend 4 million yuan as the purchase fee, and the new organization will be a corporate legal person, with 2 million yuan paid to Dentsu and 1.3 million yuan paid to the Alliance, and the remaining 700,000 yuan as a turnover fee. The site is the newly built building of Dentsu. The head of the new news agency will be appointed by the government, and the former ambassador to the United States, Deyuchi Katsuji, is the most powerful. There are two vice presidents, one is Dentsu President Mitsunaga Hoshio, and the other is Alliance Special Envoy Iwanaga Yukichi. There are two secretaries, one is Alliance's Yoshino Inosuke, and the other is Dentsu Mitsunaga Shinzo. The directors of other foreign bureaus will be selected from the bureau chief level of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the directors of the domestic bureaus have not yet been determined. There are also ten directors, three from Dentsu and seven from the Alliance. Silk Merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Request to Organize</p>
<h3>Silk Promotion Association</h3>
<p>| Opinion Proposed by Chu Huiseng, Etc. | | Go to Qingdao and Beijing to Visit Song and Chen and Request Adoption | Seeing the tragic decline of Chinese silk, Chu Huiseng and Shen Huachen, leaders of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, specially proposed an opinion on organizing a "Unified Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Promotion Association". Chu took advantage of the summer vacation to take it to Qingdao to visit Song Ziwen, the permanent member of the National Economic Council, and to Nanjing to visit Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, requesting adoption. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met Chu at his private residence and learned the details of the process, which are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Separate Visits to Song and Chen</h3>
<p>After arriving in Qingdao, Mr. Chu immediately sent the draft "Opinions on Organizing and Controlling the Promotion Association of Jiangzhe Factory Silk" to Mr. Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council. The next day, he visited again to discuss it further. Mr. Song expressed his support for the silk industry relief plan and agreed to deliberate further upon returning to Shanghai. Upon passing through Nanjing, he visited Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, who agreed to study the opinions and then review them. As for the stable silk price association being prepared by silk factories in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, he had consulted with Cai Shengbai, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Electrical Silk Weaving Trade Association, and others, who all expressed their support and agreed to submit it to the association's general meeting for discussion. Currently, the export of Chinese silk remains stagnant. B-grade standard silk is priced at approximately 420 yuan in Chinese currency, and reeling silk still results in losses. Silk factories in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are barely maintaining operations, with closures common. There are 33 factories in Shanghai, 28 in Wuxi, and 17 in Zhejiang, but all operate intermittently.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Organization</h3>
<p>The reasons for the "Opinions on Organizing and Controlling the Promotion Association of Jiangzhe Factory Silk" drafted by Mr. Chu and Mr. Shen are as follows: China's silk industry has a long history. In recent years, it has suffered from the impact of Japanese silk dumping and the internal sense of senseless competition among peers, leading to the decline of silk factories and a complete collapse. The price of cocoons has plummeted, failing to cover the cost of silkworm rearing, and villagers are cutting down mulberry trees one after another. This has a significant impact on the agricultural and industrial economy. The way to save it is to simultaneously improve all aspects of sericulture, silk reeling, and trade, so as to achieve smooth flow and avoid the harm of overproduction. For all industries, production and sales are a whole problem, without distinguishing between the root and the branch. If efforts are only made to improve production while neglecting the streamlining of sales channels, the result will inevitably hinder the advancement of various improvement plans for planting mulberry trees, producing seeds, raising silkworms, and reeling silk. This year, the price of cocoons has fallen below the cost of silkworm rearing. However, according to recent silk prices, silk factories still lose more than one hundred yuan per dan when reeling silk. How can manufacturers on the verge of collapse withstand such huge losses? They will inevitably close down one after another. If no one operates silk factories, no one will buy silkworm cocoons. It will inevitably lead to no one raising silkworms and planting mulberry trees in rural areas, and the foundation will collapse, making improvement efforts futile. The key lies in the stagnation of sales channels. To streamline sales channels, a complete organization and control system must be implemented to be effective. According to the statistics of the past two years, the annual silk production of Jiangzhe factories is only 50,000 dan. After deducting the 20,000 dan that can be sold to silk factories in the two provinces, less than 30,000 dan need to be promoted abroad. Taking the American market alone, it needs 500,000 to 600,000 dan of factory silk annually. How can this small amount not be sold? Some say that the quality of Chinese factory silk is poor, so it is rejected by Americans. We must first improve the quality before we can compete with Japanese silk. This is true. However, improving the quality of cocoons and innovating machinery cannot be achieved overnight, and the precarious situation of silk is imminent. If there is no solution this year, it will be difficult to continue raising silkworms and reeling silk next year. Moreover, the quality of Japanese silk sold to the United States as standard is equivalent to our B-grade factory silk. They can sell it, but we cannot. Why? The major reasons are twofold. First, Japanese silk has promotion agencies in European and American markets that spare no effort in promoting and attracting customers. The silk stored in New York often amounts to 50,000 to 100,000 dan, sufficient to meet the needs of manufacturers. China's factory silk still follows the old methods for foreign trade, waiting for foreigners to place orders by telegram. Today, people abandon what is near for what is far, which is not only inconvenient but also risks market price fluctuations, which is naturally unacceptable. Therefore, the export volume decreases year by year. Second, Japanese silk relies on the government as a backing and does not hesitate to dump it at low prices. Due to cost considerations, Chinese factory silk cannot follow the price drop, and the difference is always between fifty and seventy yuan. How can anyone be expected to abandon cheap goods for expensive ones? In the past two years, silk and cocoon industry groups in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have held joint meetings to discuss this issue, all agreeing that if promotion agencies are not established in international markets as soon as possible, not even a single strand of silk will be exported. They suggested to the Silk Improvement Committee to quickly organize a management agency to control promotion in order to save the situation. However, some standing committee members of the committee were preoccupied with planning seed production and mulberry planting, and had no time for other matters, while others were focused on their own sales channels and had no intention of taking care of others. This proposal was shelved. It is heard that the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, together with the Ministry of Finance, has proposed a silk relief plan, considering both production and sales. We are extremely gratified. However, the former of the two major reasons mentioned above must be considered, but how to remedy the latter has not yet been announced. If the government can allocate 3 million yuan annually to subsidize the export of factory silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, then the price comparison between Chinese silk and Japanese silk will naturally not be a problem. Otherwise, with the price difference, even if promotion agencies are established abroad, Chinese silk will still have no way out. Fucheng and others are concerned about this and have devised a method to inject funds, intending to organize the Jiangzhe Factory Silk Promotion Association to fully implement control, using the surplus from domestic sales to compensate for the losses from foreign sales. In this way, domestic silk prices can be stabilized, and foreign sales can be smooth. With factory silk as collateral for loans and remittances, the financial community will also welcome it. The government's burden will be lighter, and merchants and farmers will benefit equally. Whether or not this is appropriate, we respectfully await your selection.</p>
<h3>Specific Measures</h3>
<p>(A) The government shall appoint a number of commissioners, and silk industry groups in Jiangsu and Zhejiang shall each elect a number of representatives to organize the Jiangzhe Factory Silk Promotion Association.</p>
<p>(B) The Jiangzhe Factory Silk Promotion Association shall be responsible for managing the output of silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, developing foreign sales markets, stabilizing domestic market prices, standardizing output, standardizing grades, and other matters related to silk factory trade.</p>
<p>(C) The Jiangzhe Factory Silk Promotion Association shall establish a general office in Shanghai and branch offices in Lyon, France, and New York, USA, as silk promotion agencies. Branch offices may be established in key locations inland.</p>
<p>(D) The government shall allocate 1 million yuan in cash (or value based on public bonds) as the Jiangzhe Factory Silk Promotion Association's fund to be used as collateral for factory silk loans or remittances, and the interest shall be used to cover the expenses of the general office and branch offices.</p>
<p>(E) The powers and responsibilities of the Jiangzhe Factory Silk Promotion Association are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All silk reeled by factories within Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces shall first report the brand name and storage location to the association for registration. The association, together with the Commodity Inspection Bureau, shall take samples, seal them, and have the Inspection Bureau verify the grade as a basis for promotion. A copy of the inspection certificate shall be kept by the association.</p>
<p>Explanation: The quality of products from various factories is uneven. If the grade is not verified by the Inspection Bureau, there will be no standard for promotion, and the grade will be uncertain, which will cause great losses to silk merchants.</p>
<p>1. Foreign countries need a large amount of silk of the same grade, but there is no way to supply it, missing opportunities.</p>
<p>2. When foreign merchants order factory silk, if the market price suddenly drops, they often refuse to accept it, citing that it does not meet the agreed grade.</p>
<p>3. When applying for loans from banks, they are either rejected or given a lower loan amount because there is no grade to rely on.</p>
<p>4. Silk factories also have frequent disputes due to the uncertainty of the grade. Therefore, controlling promotion should take verifying the grade of products as the most important task.</p>
<p>(2) Every June and November, the association shall invite representatives from silk factories to discuss and determine the cost of each grade of factory silk. For those sold domestically, the fixed market price shall be the cost plus 10% profit.</p>
<p>Explanation: Silk factories have been losing money for years. 90% of the old factories have stopped operating. Capitalists regard this industry as a daunting task and dare not try again. Most of those who collected cocoons and started operations this year are former factory employees who barely raised a small amount of capital to make a living. If the silk price cannot be stabilized and continues to decline, they will have no capital to lose and will have to stop operating. Some silk factories in Shanghai have already closed down. Therefore, to maintain silk factories, it is necessary to first stabilize the domestic silk price so that it does not damage the cost. However, the annual output of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is approximately 50,000 dan. More than 10,000 dan can be sold domestically, and more than 20,000 dan must be promoted abroad to avoid stagnation. However, the foreign market price is difficult to fix. According to the international market situation in recent years, losses are inevitable. How to compensate for this must be planned in advance. Therefore, it is proposed that those sold domestically should be priced at cost plus 10% as a reserve fund for foreign sales losses. This is the same principle that applies to commodities from various countries that are priced higher domestically and lower abroad. Some say that increasing the silk price will hinder silk sales. However, silk prices also fall with silk prices, and silk factories will inevitably have inventory and suffer losses together. When the Silk Improvement Committee held its founding meeting, silk factory representatives also supported this proposal. Adding 10% to the silk price will only add one or two cents per foot to the silk price. Why worry that it cannot be sold? The reason for discussing prices twice in June and November is that the spring silkworm cocoon harvest is completed in June, and the autumn silkworm cocoon harvest is completed in November. The profits that each factory should receive will be deposited by the association in the name of each factory in a bank or money shop. After the exported silk is sold and the losses are offset, the surplus will be returned according to the dan.</p>
<p>Explanation: Merchants are profit-driven. If their sales channels are not restricted, they will inevitably compete to sell domestically. Who would want to export? Therefore, retaining the surplus is to ensure that they must sell half of their products abroad.</p>
<p>(3) All silk reeled by factories within Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces must be sold to the association. The same applies to silk from factories in other provinces that are sold in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. However, this does not apply to silk that is directly promoted abroad by each factory with the special permission of the association.</p>
<p>(4) The association shall accept the request of each factory to provide collateral for loans or remittances for their products.</p>
<p>Explanation: Since each factory is forced to sell their products to the association, if the association does not provide collateral for loans or remittances for them, the factory's funds will not be able to circulate, which is forcing people to do the impossible and will inevitably make it impossible to implement. The association has a fund of 1 million yuan, which is sufficient to provide collateral for 10,000 dan, making it not difficult to provide collateral for loans or remittances.</p>
<p>(5) The association shall observe the silk sales situation in France and the United States and the overseas market conditions, and transport Jiangzhe factory silk to the sales location at any time to supply the foreign market with spot goods. The association shall not charge commissions for promoting factory silk, except for the usual settlement of shipping, insurance, and pier fees.</p>
<p>(6) All weaving factories and silk shops within Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces that need factory silk must purchase it from the association's general office and branch offices.</p>
<p>(7) The association shall provide assistance to the Jiangzhe region when the supply and demand of factory silk are not timely. Pan Yangyao talked</p>
<h3>The State of Various Industries in Shanghai in the First Half of the Year</h3>
<p>Bank Profits Decrease Compared to Last Year; Most Industries Decline, Few Prosper. According to the Central News Agency, the operating conditions of various industries in the city have declined due to the impact of the global economic downturn. To understand the exact situation of various industries in the city in the first half of this year, a Central News Agency reporter interviewed Pan Yangyao at his office. According to Mr. Pan, the situation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Banks Have Funds But Nowhere to Lend</h3>
<p>Mr. Pan first talked about the current state of the financial industry in the city, saying that although several new banks have been established in the city's financial sector in the first half of this year, in reality, the statistics show that the operating profits of various banks in the first half of this year decreased by 10% compared to the same period last year. The operations of various banks this year are still concentrated in investments in real estate, public bonds, and other investments. The interest on real estate investments has been decreasing year by year, reaching only 3-4%. Public bonds also do not have huge profits to be made. As for industrial and commercial loans, due to the decline of all industries in recent years, there is a feeling that there are funds but nowhere to lend. These situations are the only reason for the decline in the operations of the banking sector. However, there are also one or two banks in the city, such as the China Shanghai Bank, whose vision is relatively long-term, and they are now investing their excess funds in the interior. This is a good phenomenon in the banking sector recently, and it is necessary for various banks to follow suit. If they continue to invest in real estate, public bonds, and other investments, it will be enough to make the banking sector's operations fall into decline.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Declines, Flour Flourishes</h3>
<p>As for the cotton yarn and flour industries, the operating conditions in the first half of the year show that cotton yarn declined and flour flourished. Because the cotton yarn industry is in a time when cotton is expensive and yarn is cheap, and foreign yarn is competing for sales in China, the operating conditions are getting worse year by year. The decline of the cotton yarn industry is not only due to this reason. Yarn factories operated by Chinese people are far inferior to foreign factories in terms of management. Taking the yarn spindle as an example, foreign yarn factories only need 150 workers to manage every 10,000 spindles, while Chinese yarn factories need 400-500 people. Other aspects, such as the protection of machinery, are also far less strict than foreign merchants. Therefore, the yarn factories operated by Chinese people are suffering losses and many are going bankrupt, which is of great importance to the future of the domestic cotton yarn industry. As for the flour industry, the good signs of operation in the first half of the year are rare in history. The value of flour has now soared from 1.9 yuan to 2.7 yuan. The sales of flour are booming due to the needs of various places. The wheat harvest in the Jiangbei area is abundant. According to flour merchants, this year's wheat harvest in various places is enough to not rely on foreign wheat.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Industry is Developing Day by Day</h3>
<p>The development of the domestic goods industry has shown a vigorous and good phenomenon. Domestic goods companies have been established one after another in various places, and the domestic goods industry has also developed as a result. Domestic machinery factories have naturally improved their operations since the Ministry of Finance increased the import tariff rate for foreign machinery. There was a severe drought in various places in the summer, and the sales of water pumps were particularly strong. The cloth industry is declining due to the dumping of foreign goods, and there is a danger of not being able to make ends meet. The enamel industry is experiencing competition among peers in recent years, which has led to the selling price falling below the cost, resulting in huge losses. The number of bankruptcies cannot be counted. This phenomenon is not unique to the enamel industry. I hope that the peers will consider the competition of this product and no longer engage in this suicidal competition. The rubber industry has been declining year by year. Recently, due to the rise in rubber prices, the industry has been losing money day by day. Except for one or two factories with more capital that can still maintain operations, many have gone bankrupt or stopped operating. The bakelite industry is a newly emerging industry, but all the raw materials for bakelite are foreign goods, and there are already 20-30 factories. Most of their products are cups, saucers, and the like. The electrical materials industry has been very developed this year. The sales of Huasheng electric fans and Yapu'er electric lights have surpassed imported goods. Other industries such as the knitting industry have had a good operating situation in the first half of the year.</p>

<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Two New Steamships</p>
<h3>Arriving in Shanghai in Mid-October</h3>
<p>New ship models have been sent to Shanghai. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is building four steamships with funds borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity, named Haiyuan, Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen. After the ships arrive in Shanghai, it has been decided that they will sail to Shanghai, Shantou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou as regular passenger ships to replace the current Taishun Yuanyuan and other lines. The company has sent apprentice machinists and personnel to bring the ships to Shanghai. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from supervisory commissioner Wu Daming and others, saying that the Haiyuan and Haiheng ships can be fully loaded by September 10 and can leave England in mid-September, arriving in Shanghai by October 15 at the latest. Photos of the four new ships have been sent to the company (as shown in the picture). The four steamships are 343 feet long, 47 feet wide, 25 feet high to the upper deck, and 17 feet 6 inches high to the open deck. They can carry 3,000 tons of cargo and have a speed of 13 nautical miles per hour. There are 11 large dining rooms with a capacity of 22 guests, 16 officer cabins (i.e., second-class rooms) with a capacity of 53 people, and a third-class cabin with a capacity of 56 people, for a total capacity of 131 people. The ships have special equipment such as automatic water meters, direction finders, and anti-theft devices, which are not available on any other Chinese or foreign steamships in Shanghai. The service personnel used as tea room attendants on each ship have been trained on Dagu Road, teaching them nautical knowledge, Cantonese, and Fuzhou dialect. The business director has been changed to a business manager. The route will start on November 1. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is building new steamships in England.</p>
<p>The Hotel Industry Opposes Tax Increase</p>
<h3>Petitioning the Municipal Government This Morning</h3>
<p>Requesting Negotiations with the Municipal Council to Alleviate Business Difficulties and Presenting Everything to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Federation of Associations. The Municipal Hotel Industry Association, due to its opposition to the Municipal Council's unwarranted increase in property tax, previously petitioned Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director, requesting that he ask the Municipal Council to withdraw the decision. The association has again decided to send representatives Sun Qiuping and others to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the First Special District Municipal Federation of Associations this morning at 9:00 AM to request assistance. The original text of their petition is extracted below:</p>
<h3>Petition to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Presenting a petition to the board of directors. It has been found that the Municipal Council's Tax Office in the Public Concession recently intends to change the method of collecting patrol tax from the hotel industry, estimating the total rent of the houses based on the marked prices of the rooms for business and redrafting the tax amount, which exceeds the original amount by more than 50-60% (details are attached in the table). In practice, the tax rate of 14% of the rent has now been changed to about 21%. At a time when the market is sluggish and the entire city is calling for rent reductions, it is actually estimating higher rents and going against the trend, which is very unreasonable. According to the Municipal Council's intention, perhaps because there are more and more vacant houses in the city, it is willing to exhaust all means to make up for the tax revenue, not knowing that the current tax rate was set during the most prosperous period of business before the Shanghai War. Now the business has plummeted, and maintaining the original amount is already extremely difficult. However, the Municipal Council once increased the business tax in July last year, and still feeling it is not enough, it re-estimates the rent higher and increases the tax in disguise without the authorization of the taxpayers. This not only despises the taxpayers' greatest power, but also completely overturns the entire property tax base of the Public Concession. For the sake of the hotel industry's survival and to prevent similar incidents from happening in other industries, the association must lead the industry to consistently insist on protecting the taxpayers' greatest power from being undermined or despised, so as to prevent the Municipal Council from arbitrarily increasing taxes as a bad precedent. A special statement of the process is presented, along with a declaration against the tax increase and a survey table of the tax increase for each hotel (already published in yesterday's newspaper). Please review and verify, and request that the government use its power to save the citizens of the special district who are in deep water and fire, and quickly correct the Municipal Council's financial policy of burning forests to hunt. This is for the public good.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>We respectfully inform you that our association has briefly described the facts and circumstances of the case of illegally increasing taxes by the Tax Office of the Municipal Council and sent a letter to your association for assistance. We have also received a reply from your association correcting the matter. Now, we specially send representatives Sun Qiuping and others to present the declaration against the tax increase published by our association and the survey table of the tax increase for each hotel to you, to present our humble opinions. We respectfully hope for your instructions on everything, so as to follow and comply. We sincerely seek your public opinion. (The letter to the Municipal Federation of Associations is similar) Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law</p>
<h3>The Banking Association Responds with Compliance</h3>
<p>There are various complicated facts that require detailed regulations. Requesting amendments to various articles, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review. Non-member banks submitted a request to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry to amend the Shanghai Municipal Banking Association's request to amend Articles 5, 7, 8, and 15 of the Savings Bank Law. The Ministry of Finance has submitted it to the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan for review. As for more than 40 non-member banks, including Jianghai, after agreeing with the original text submitted by the Banking Association to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry, the Banking Association has corrected it, affixed the seals of each bank, and sent it to the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance at 2:00 PM yesterday to request amendments. Regarding Article 9, the Banking Association submitted a reply to the Ministry of Finance at 10:00 AM yesterday, stating: Presenting a reply regarding the matter. The case was instructed by the Ministry of Commerce and Finance, Shanghai Money Order No. 1 (abridged), etc. Upon receiving this, the association should comply with the instructions to protect the interests of depositors and increase its own credibility, in order to live up to the Ministry's emphasis on savings. However, it has been found that Article 7 of the Savings Bank Law stipulates eight methods for the use of savings bank funds, with clear distinctions and strict boundaries. It is clearly stipulated in the law as the scope of business, and it is naturally a guarantee of reliable assets in fact. The matter is clear and there is no doubt. The members of the association should comply with the provisions of Article 9 of this law, that is, deposit 25% of the total amount of savings deposits with the Central Bank, equivalent to government bonds, treasury bills, and reliable assets within the scope of business stipulated in this law, as a guarantee for the repayment of savings deposits. As for the management plan after depositing with the Central Bank, the Ministry will certainly make proper arrangements to show great trust. However, in order to increase depositors' trust and facilitate the withdrawal of assets, it is proposed to establish a special management committee, in addition to the Ministry's appointment of special commissioners, and the local Banking Association and other legal entities shall each elect a number of representatives to jointly organize it, so that it can independently exercise its powers within the scope of management. This will not only encourage the public's interest in savings, but also clearly stipulate the procedures for banks to withdraw or exchange government bonds, treasury bills, and collateralized assets. The Ministry is requested to consult the Central Bank during the drafting of the management plan, so that the association may have the opportunity to participate, so as to gather opinions and benefit all parties. In addition, the government bonds and treasury bills that are to be deposited, such as the need to calculate according to market prices, how to withdraw when prices rise, and how to make up when prices fall, must be stipulated in advance. The association believes that the government should enforce the law, and the people should comply with the orders, but there are various complicated facts that must be carefully regulated before the implementation can be fully beneficial. Therefore, we do not hesitate to state the facts and present them truthfully. We hope that you will review and approve them. Whether or not this is appropriate, we request your instructions and compliance for the public good. Respectfully submitted, the Rickshaw Association.</p>

<h3>Holding Registration of Chartered Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>Starting September 1st, the Municipal Council announced that the registration of rickshaw pullers for private rickshaws (chartered rickshaws) within the concession will be held. The first batch will be processed from September 1st to 8th. There are two registration offices: one at the corner of Wusong Road and Bazilu in Hongkou, which will process rickshaw pullers from No. 1 to No. 1040 this time; and one at the Public Works Department's warehouse on Macheng Road, which will process rickshaw pullers from No. 7501 to No. 8540 this time.

<h3>Holding a Full Line Section Meeting</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the full-line section meeting of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways was held in the conference room of the Shanghai North Station Transportation Department the other day. Attending were the heads of the transportation department and section chiefs Fan Shouzhi, Sun Jialu (deputy Li Jiahe), Wu Yukun, Wu Yaowan (deputy Wang Shouheng), Li Xishu, Shi Zao, Zheng Bao San (deputy Shi Zao), Yin Zhilu, Feng Qili, Cheng Xipei, Jiang Shenghua, Luo Shenghao, Liu Guozhen, Wang Zhigang, Yang Xiaozeng, Lu Weiyan, Wang Shuchun, Chen Youshen, Li Songbai, Zhong Wenjiang, Wu Shuchang, Zheng Wenpei (deputy Wang Shulong), Wang Shulong, Zhou Jigang, Zhong Jianhun, Huang Renjie, Jiang Tieling, Zou Yuou, Sun Lida, Wang Youzhang (deputy Chen Zhengxin), Liao Mianqing, Huang Bokui, etc. Wang Zhigang chaired, and Wang Huirong and Tang Xiongjie took notes. The details are as follows: After the chairman reported the meeting in accordance with the procedure, the chairman first gave a report, roughly stating that section meetings of the two railways have always been limited to the respective sections of each department, which is extremely limited in scope and has little effect. Recently, the管理局 (Management Bureau) has stipulated measures for joint section meetings, whereby the responsible personnel of each section of each department hold joint meetings within their respective sections. Recently, it has been further expanded to a full-line joint section meeting, bringing together the leaders of each section to solve all kinds of problems. It can be said to be an unprecedented initiative for the two railways. Today is the first meeting, and I am very happy that you have graced us with your presence, and that Director Huang has taken the time to come and give us guidance. There are a total of twenty items on the agenda today, and I hope that you will all share your great insights so that all the proposals can be easily resolved. Director Huang addressed the meeting, saying: (1) In all undertakings, we must work together with one heart to overcome the environment. The same is true for railway undertakings. After arriving on the railway, I realized the importance of this point and first advocated the division of labor, so that employees can do their best within the scope of their duties. However, if the division of labor is too detailed, it can easily lead to a lack of cooperation. To remedy this, there is the organization of joint section meetings. I am well aware that in the past, reforms that benefited the public were often unable to be implemented due to isolation between the parties or a lack of opportunities for mutual discussion. Now that joint section meetings are being held, I hope you will make full use of them. In other words, (thorough division of labor, thorough cooperation) will be effective. (2) The work of the railway is transportation, and the important conditions for transportation are two: one is orderliness, and the other is cleanliness. The equipment, layout, and all order must be neat and clean. I hope that the colleagues of this railway, especially the transportation and police departments, will do their best to start with themselves. (3) A year ago, this bureau promoted model stations. Since its implementation, it is doubtful whether the word "model" has been fully achieved. Therefore, to implement model stations, complete improvements must be made in all aspects, such as equipment and personnel, to be worthy of the name. (4) Recently, the government authorities, in view of the decline of people's morals and bad habits, have made every effort to promote the New Life Movement, which is indeed a good medicine for the problem. I hope that all colleagues will earnestly implement it. (5) The full-line joint section meeting brings together the leaders of each section and each department to discuss and study together. It is a rare opportunity. I hope you will make good use of it, with "public" as the goal. Those that are beneficial to the railway should be promoted to realization, and those that are harmful to the railway should be jointly removed. (6) The employees of this railway have always held the prejudice of "the more you do, the more mistakes you make; the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make; and doing nothing is no mistake," which has invisibly reduced work efficiency. The reason for this is that performance appraisals have not been emphasized in the past. In the future, you must conduct strict performance appraisals of your subordinates with a fair attitude, so that those who are lazy in their work have no chance to advance, and everyone has the mentality of "the more you do, the more you get; the less you do, the less you get; and doing nothing is not allowed." Then, work efficiency will naturally increase day by day. Resolutions on various cases: (1) How can the car, engineering, machine, and police sections cooperate effectively? Resolution: Submit to the bureau and order each department to stipulate the scope of authority of each section, and submit it to the bureau for approval and implementation. (2) Standardized Chinese names should be stipulated for vehicle parts and machinery for easy reference. Resolution: The words "(and engineering equipment)" should be added after vehicle parts and machinery, and submitted to the Management Bureau for forwarding to the Ministry of Railways for stipulation and implementation. (3) It is proposed to change all the wooden grids on top of livestock cars to wire mesh to prevent theft. Resolution: Submit to the bureau and hand it over to the vehicle standard meeting for review. (4) Railway police assist ticket collectors at small stations in collecting tickets. Resolution: Within the possible scope, the railway police stationed at the station should assist the ticket collectors in collecting tickets. (5) Stipulate the handover procedures for new construction projects between the engineering and car departments. Resolution: Handle it together with the first case. (6) The preservation period and disposal methods after the expiration of the files, books, documents, etc., of each section station should be stipulated. Resolution: Submit to the bureau for stipulation and implementation. (7) Clarify the location of employee residences. Resolution: (A) This case should be changed to (Clarify the location of employee and police residences) case. (B) Pass in principle. The detailed measures should be sent to the Employee Welfare Committee for review. (8) Please print and issue a book for responsible goods to be handed over. Resolution: The Transportation Department and the Police Department will discuss and handle it together. (9) Improve the lead printing of freight cars on this railway. Resolution: The Transportation Department will handle it together with the case. (10) Ban the use of grass ropes around the canvas covers of high-side cars and flat cars on this railway, and change to hemp ropes. Resolution: Submit to the bureau and hand it over to the Transportation Department to handle. (11) Ban the placement of responsible goods signs inside the lead-printed silk. Resolution: Submit to the bureau and transfer it to the Responsible Transportation Committee of the Ministry of Railways to notify the joint transportation roads that the insertion of joint transportation vehicles and the installation of license plate frames should be set up in accordance with the regulations for easy insertion of license plates. (12) Please build brick and tile barracks at Henglin, Qishuyan, and Benniu small stations to avoid occupying the freight yard. Resolution: Submit to the bureau and handle it together with the case. (13) It is proposed to improve the facilities of third and fourth class trains to benefit passengers. Resolution: Submit to the bureau and hand it over to the Transportation Department for appropriate handling. (14) It is proposed to set up public tea buckets at each station along the line, and to issue food business licenses to each small station as appropriate. Resolution: Submit to the bureau for the Transportation Department to study and handle. (15) Please repair the wall of the Xizhan station to maintain order and protect the road benefits. Resolution: The original proposer should submit it to the Police Department and forward it to the Management Bureau for approval. (16) Employees of this railway, whether working or not, should wear badges to identify themselves within the railway area. Resolution: Submit to the bureau for circulation and implementation.

<h3>Circular to All Members of the National Medicine Industry</h3>
<p>Advising them to reorganize the association and clear outstanding fees The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a circular to all executive and supervisory committee members of the National Medicine Industry Association, saying: "The members of the National Medicine Industry Association are mostly established and reputable Chinese medicine businesses. In terms of financial resources and reputation, they are difficult to compare with other newly formed associations that lack a long history and solid foundation. The association's membership in the Chamber of Commerce and payment of annual membership fees is a necessary expense and should be included in the budget and paid on schedule. However, according to the association's past situation, there were already significant arrears before the reorganization, which is rare in other industries. After the reorganization, it was hoped that competent people would be in charge and eliminate the previous bad habits. However, the old habits have not been eliminated and the arrears remain. It has been three and a half years and the amount has reached 2,470 yuan, which is regrettable. According to Article 11 of the Chamber of Commerce's charter, members who fail to pay their annual membership fees are originally subject to the suspension of their rights, and Article 17 of the charter clearly stipulates that members who are in arrears for two years must be removed from membership. The Chamber of Commerce has often accommodated the association's previous requests and has not strictly enforced the rules, which the association's committee members are well aware of. Now, the general meeting of members of this term has resolved to give these members in arrears a deadline of six months to pay off their debts. If they still fail to pay, they will be removed from membership in accordance with the rules at the end of the deadline, and their membership rights will be suspended before payment. Therefore, on August 9, the association's letter requesting exemption from license fees could not be forwarded and was replied to in letter No. 357 of the Pu character. Although in terms of the Chamber of Commerce's position, it has repeatedly accommodated the association in advance, and this term has again generously given a deadline, it is already doing its best in terms of both reason and law. However, the shortcomings of the association itself have affected all members of the industry, which cannot but be regretted. The committee members of the association have a duty to support the association and should try to remedy the situation so that the removal of membership at the end of the deadline on December 17 of this year does not come true. This is what the Chamber of Commerce hopes for. This letter is hereby issued, and it is hoped that you will take note of it." The Municipal Land Bureau announced</p>
<h3>Revised Standards for Handling Over-Area Land</h3>
<p>The original standards are abolished at the same time. The Municipal Land Bureau issued Announcement No. 126 yesterday regarding the promulgation of revised standards for handling over-area land and the abolition of the original standards. The announcement stated: "After investigation, the previous standards for handling over-area land formulated by the Bureau have many drawbacks since their implementation. Therefore, they have been revised and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. The full text of the revised standards is hereby announced for implementation, and all the original standards are abolished at the same time. All property owners in the city are hereby notified." The announcement lists the revised standards for handling over-area land: (1) For households exchanging land ownership certificates, if there is over-area land or encroachment on old public canal road bases, the price must be paid uniformly (calculated at 60% of the market price). (2) If the over-area land or encroached land is less than 3%, and the household cannot afford to pay the price, an over-area land stamp may be added, stating (The extra [amount] area of land is temporarily allowed to be used, but the price must still be paid upon transfer), and the market price must be paid in full upon transfer. (3) If the over-area land or encroached land is more than 3%, and there is a house built on it, and the household cannot afford to pay the price, a stamp may also be added, stating (The extra [amount] area of land is temporarily allowed to be used, but the price must still be paid upon transfer), but interest at 6% per annum shall be charged according to the land price, and the market price must be paid in full upon transfer. (4) If the over-area land or encroached land is more than 3%, and there is no house built on it, and the household cannot afford to pay the price, it will be designated as municipal public land.</p>

<h3>Severe Drought in Jing County, Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai wired to appeal for relief. The Central News Agency reported that the Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai received a report from Jing County about the disaster and a telegram requesting relief: "The Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai, please be informed that since the beginning of summer, the drought demon has been rampant. It has not rained for three months, and the scorching sun has baked the land, causing the fields and grains to wither and die. The residents of the mountains and valleys have even crossed mountains and ridges to fetch water for drinking six or seven miles away. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in nearly a century. As a result, people are panicked about food, and there are signs of unrest in society. County Magistrate Ye convened a meeting of various agencies and gentlemen to organize a people's food maintenance association and resolved to borrow cash from various wealthy households and shops to send people to various neighboring counties to purchase rice or flour for sale at reasonable prices in order to alleviate the current emergency. Although the number of rice and flour transported to Jing is limited, if there is no life-saving soup, how can we extend the remaining breath? We have long admired the compassion and sympathy of the fellow villagers in Shanghai. We have received the grace of benevolence in sharing food and rice. We will purchase wheat and sail boats to imitate the beauty of the ancients. We will generously provide relief and accept the request without hesitation. On behalf of the disaster victims, we respectfully request help." Zhao Bogao, District Chief of the First District of Jing County, and Wang Wei Chun, Secretary-General of the Farmers Association, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Smooth Navigation on the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>The Suzhou Creek was previously affected by the severe drought, and some of the inland river ferries were suspended. Now it is learned that due to the recent high tide, the river water is almost level with the banks during high tide, so navigation is smooth. All ferries have fully resumed navigation.

<h3>Decision on Bid Price for Building Association Hall</h3>
<p>Xin Shengji Construction Company undertakes construction Since its establishment, the Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association has had plans to build an association hall, raise funds to purchase land, and submit samples for bidding, which has been quite a feat. It is now learned that when the bidding was opened on the second of this month, a total of twelve companies submitted bids. The largest bid was from San Sen Construction Company, which required more than 490,000 yuan. The four companies with bids under 300,000 yuan were Xin Shengji, Dachang, Xinsen Tai, and Tailai. Yesterday afternoon, the association's Construction Specialized Committee met and decided that the lowest bid from Xin Shengji would be accepted. The contract price is 278,950 yuan. It is also learned that Zhang Ziliang, the owner of Xin Shengji Construction Company, is a native of Qingdun, Chuansha, and has a good reputation in Shanghai construction. Now that a fellow villager is undertaking the construction of the fellow-villagers association hall, he will surely build it with enthusiasm and care. Teahouse selling alcohol</p>

<h3>Establishment of Zu'an Weaving Company</h3>
<p>Leasing the old site of Zu'an Sock Factory The Flying Foot brand silk stockings produced by Zu'an Sock Factory have always been a high-quality domestic product. In addition to being popular in various commercial ports in China, they are also popular in Nanyang, Australia, and Holland. However, the January 28 Shanghai Incident broke out, causing the factory to suffer huge losses and suspend operations for two years. Now, two Cantonese merchants, Mr. Chen and Mr. Huang, have jointly invested in leasing all the factory's machinery and equipment, renamed Zu'an Xingji Weaving Company, specializing in weaving high-quality silk stockings that are thin, strong, and far superior to imported products. This is truly a high-quality domestic product.</p>

<h3>The Affair of One Concubine Erupts Again, Causing a Great Stir</h3>
<p>Was the tragic death of One Concubine really a murder? Her mother sues Xie Peide and others for hiring someone to shoot her. Each suffered a shot to the brain and heart, deemed suspicious. Request to open the coffin and hand it over to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for autopsy. Xie Peide, the business director of the Shanghai Cement Company, previously took the famous prostitute Yifei Lao Liu as his concubine and loved her very much. Xie was a member of the Fanwangdu Club. Every day after work, he would take Lao Liu to the club for recreation. The members of the club were all wealthy merchants in Shanghai. Yang Binghu, the grandson of Yang Qiusun, the comprador of Puyi Real Estate Company, was also a member, and he was young and handsome and had not yet found a good match. When he saw Lao Liu, they were very happy with each other. Xie took the opportunity to give Lao Liu to Binghu, who chose an auspicious day and held a formal wedding ceremony with Lao Liu in a hotel. Xie even officiated the wedding. People praised Xie for sacrificing his love to preserve his friendship. Unexpectedly, Binghu</p>
<h3>Had Shallow Fortune</h3>
<p>From then on, he was not tolerated by his family and had to separate from Lao Liu in order to maintain family harmony. On the night of April 28 this year, Binghu accompanied his grandfather Yang Qiusun and Xie Peide to the residence of Li, the concubine of Hong Chengde, the son of the Ningbo merchant Hong Xianfang, intending to say goodbye to Lao Liu, but they suddenly died in the same room. At the time, it was rumored that the deaths of the two were actually suicides. Therefore, after the police reported the case to the Shanghai First Special District District Court for examination of the male and female corpses and ordered the respective family members to collect them for burial, there were no other developments. Although Chen Wangshi, the mother of Yifei, had at the time expressed her intention to request legal sanctions against the parties involved, she had not proceeded with the matter for a long time. It was not until last month that the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office received a report and opened a court session for investigation. However, the outcome is still unknown. Recently, Chen Wangshi declared</p>
<h3>To Seek Justice for Her Daughter</h3>
<p>She has entrusted a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation with the Shanghai First Special District District Court, naming Xie Peide, Hong Chengde, and Hong's concubine as the three defendants, alleging that the death of her daughter Chen Zhujun (her maiden name before becoming a prostitute) was actually premeditated by the defendants. She requested that the three defendants be sentenced to death in accordance with Article 184 of the Criminal Code. This case has been going on for nearly four months since it occurred. At the beginning of the incident, it caused quite a stir and social discussion. In recent days, it has no longer been noticed. Now that Chen Wangshi has mentioned it again and even resorted to legal action, it has restored its former</p>
<h3>Serious State</h3>
<p>The plaintiff states that her daughter Chen Zhujun, when she was nineteen years old (in the 17th year of the Republic of China), was prostituted, and the events leading up to her death at the concubine's residence of Hong Chengde are listed in great detail. However, the points stated by the plaintiff differ greatly from what was previously reported. It is claimed that her daughter first became a prostitute in the Huiteli brothel on Fourth Road, using the name Yifei. At this time, she met a comprador of a certain institution, Mr. Pan, and was soon hired by Liangzhu and kept as a mistress in Changyunli, Xindazhan Road. Under his favor, she was given jewelry and clothing worth 27,800 yuan. Later, due to family relations, Pan could not continue to live with her for a long time, so he left her and the jewelry was also given to her. From then on, Yifei</p>
<h3>Returned to Prostitution</h3>
<p>In the spring of the 18th year, she hung a sign on Shantou Road to attract pleasure seekers who were shocked by her past fame. Hearing that Feng Fu, who had retired, had come out of retirement again, they flocked to her boudoir. She once went to Peiping with Fuchunlou, and then came south. Xie Peide took her as his concubine. Yifei naturally brought all the gifts from Pan to Xie's house. Chen Wangshi had no prior knowledge of this. Afterwards, because she did not know the address of her daughter, the mother and daughter were separated and there was no news. It was not until this year in April, after Yifei married Yang Binghu, that she was able to meet her mother. The plaintiff stated in her complaint that her mother and daughter met and her daughter wept and told her about her experience with Xie, saying that Xie was still planning to use various methods to put her to death. At the time, she was half skeptical, but who knew that the tragic case would happen on the night of April 28. First, on April 26, Xie hired someone to take Yifei from No. 18 Pushi Village, Pushi Road to No. 651 Weihaiwei Road, the home of Hong Chengde, in collusion with Hong's concubine.</p>
<h3>Three Days of Private Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Afterward, he invited Binghu by telephone and ambushed a murderer in the bathroom. At the time, Yifei and Binghu were shot dead. After investigation, the deceased suffered one shot each to the brain and heart. It is clear that they were killed and not committed suicide. Both of these places are vital. After one shot, they could not commit suicide again. Moreover, the two people suffered a total of four gunshot wounds, but only three shell casings were recovered, which is even more suspicious. For the sake of clearing the grievance, she risked her life to file a lawsuit, requesting the court to retrieve the bodies of Fei and Yang Binghu from the Wanguo Cemetery and send them to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for examination to determine whether they committed suicide or were killed, so as to provide evidence.</p>
<h3>Prosecute According to Law</h3>
<p>Ms. Gai also requested the court to order Xie Peide to return the jewelry given by a Mr. Pan to the deceased Fei Ying, and the six-year-old daughter born to Fei, to be raised by her. She also solemnly stated that this lawsuit was purely to seek justice for her daughter, only seeking legal action, and did not involve any private claims or monetary matters, in order to prevent the other party from spreading rumors and falsely accusing her of extortion. From this, one can see the plaintiff's heartfelt grief for her daughter, vividly displayed on paper. The First Special Court has now approved the petition and issued summonses, notifying the three defendants and all witnesses to appear in court for trial within the coming days. It is anticipated that a large number of people will attend the hearing.</p>
<h3>Zhang Gongquan Goes to North China for Investigation</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports on rural financial relief: Mr. Zhang Gongquan, manager of the Bank of China, went to the Pingjin area by train on the 4th to investigate ways to promote rural finance in North China. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in two weeks, and then proceed with relief efforts based on the results of his investigation.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Cause Trouble</p>
<h3>Involved Zhu Shuqiao</h3>
<p>Zhu Admits Guiding Rickshaw Pullers to Seek Welfare, Denies Instigating Trouble. Rickshaw pullers in this city, instigated by unscrupulous elements, caused havoc on the 9th and 10th of this month by deflating all rickshaw tires. Five abettors, including Zheng Fazhu, were arrested by the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention, as previously reported in this newspaper. Now, the arrested criminals have confessed that a Shanghai resident named Zhu Shuqiao, 55 years old, who works at the YMCA for 28 years and once served as the principal of the Xiafei Road YMCA Middle School, is also one of the abettors in this case. Mike McCarty, a detective from the Political Department, arrested Zhu at No. 5, Lane 205, Wangzhi Road in the French Concession yesterday, confiscating a leaflet, a declaration, and a draft of the leaflet, and brought them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he sent attorney Qian Xunjiu of the police station of the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court to explain the case, requesting that it be combined with the Zheng Fazhu case for trial. The Rickshaw Association retained attorneys Wu Kaisheng and Jiang Baoli to represent them in court. Zhu Shuqiao confessed that he has been working at the YMCA and has always aimed to promote the welfare of the public. He believes that the Municipal Council's reform of the rickshaw regulations is indeed beneficial to the pullers. However, the rickshaw owners were dissatisfied, which led to the dispute. Therefore, he went to see Zhu Maocheng and Wang Zhicheng, the rickshaw affairs committee members of the Municipal Council, and they asked him to assist the Rickshaw Committee in handling affairs. He was working to liberate the hardworking rickshaw pullers, but did not take any excessive actions, and guided them entirely through peaceful and legal means. He guided Zhu Fengxiang, the representative of the Zhabei rickshaw pullers, He Liansheng, and Cang Gongwen and Cang Gongsen, the representatives of the Nanshi rickshaw pullers. Later, seeing the deflation incidents in the city, he immediately summoned Zhu and the other three for questioning. They claimed that none of the more than 3,000 rickshaw pullers under their leadership had committed such acts, and that it was done by the other faction, namely Zheng Fazhu's group. Zhu Fengxiang and others then taught him to draft a leaflet and distribute it to the pullers to persuade them to be aware. The confiscated leaflets, except for the declaration, were all drafted by him. Judge Zhan Liangce told him that the four people he was guiding, Zhu Fengxiang and others, were members of the strike committee. Zhu replied that he did not know. Judge Zhan then ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the trial to be combined with the Zheng Fazhu case. Ye Gongsan's Family</p>
<h3>Bandits Lurking at Midnight</h3>
<p>The police suspect them to be kidnappers. A bodyguard's left hand is shot by a bandit. Ye Hongying's eldest son, Ye Gongsan, a local Shanghainese and a major grain merchant in this port, currently a comprador at the Tonghe Bank at No. 4 Ningbo Road, not yet forty years old, used to live at No. 170 Shanzhong Road in the French Concession. In March of this year, due to illness and poor air quality in his old residence, he moved to a mansion at No. 323 Jupolas Road on Fukaissen Road for recuperation. At around 1 a.m. yesterday, Wang Yuzhang (20 years old), a bodyguard from Hubei employed by the Ye family, was enjoying the cool air at the door when he suddenly heard rustling footsteps outside the door. Wang slightly opened the square hole on the door to look outside and saw four burly men wearing dark blue long gowns and black and white short shirts and trousers, speaking with a northern accent, peering inside. Knowing they were not good people, Wang turned and ran to inform his family, grabbed his self-defense pistol, opened the gate, and loudly asked what they were doing there. Unexpectedly, one of the bandits, aiming to strike first, fired four shots at Wang. One bullet hit Wang's left thumb. Wang also fired three shots, but none hit. He retreated back into the gate, clutching his wound, and slammed the doors shut, then took out a whistle and blew it wildly. The bandits fled towards Baisezhong Road and disappeared without a trace. The Ye family immediately reported the incident by phone to the Beidang Road Wenlin Road police station. The police chief immediately led a large number of detectives to investigate the scene. Wang Yuzhang, who was injured, was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, his injuries were minor, and he was discharged after being bandaged. Originally, the Ye family employed one Chinese and one Russian bodyguard, with one guarding him and one guarding the house each day. After moving to the current residence, due to its remote location, they hired Wang Yuzhang from the Jingwu Sports Association a month ago to jointly guard the house. After the incident, according to police officers' observations, it is likely that they were kidnappers, as they had already learned that Ye often went out for a drive after dinner every day.</p>
<p>A Sea of People Waits to See the Strange Figure</p>
<h3>A Visit to Luodian Town</h3>
<p>Someone Did Indeed See It with Their Own Eyes a Week Ago. Waited Until Evening, but No Discovery. An Elderly Man Speculates That It Was a Reflection of the Wall. Yesterday, the newspaper reported that two human-shaped figures were suddenly discovered on the roof of the Yang family's house in Zhao Family Lane, Luodian Town, Baoshan County, swaying back and forth, moving extremely fast. When people went to investigate, they disappeared without a trace. What's even stranger is that they said it would definitely appear every day from 2 to 3 p.m. The East China News Agency reporter, considering the matter to be bizarre and difficult to believe without seeing it with their own eyes, went to Luodian Town yesterday to conduct an on-site investigation in order to understand the truth. However, they waited until evening and still did not find the strange figure on the roof. The process is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Departure to Luodian</h3>
<p>The reporter departed from Shanghai at 12:30 p.m. yesterday to investigate the truth on site and arrived at Luodian Town at 2:35 p.m. Immediately, according to the reported location of the strange figure in Zhao Family Lane, they inquired with the people of the town. Unexpectedly, Zhao Family Bridge was still three miles away on a country road from the town, and there were no vehicles available. So they walked there, arriving at Zhao Family Lane in about 20 minutes. The area belongs to Luodian Township, and the market is still relatively dense, with rice shops, incense paper shops, and other stores lining the streets. The street is quite long, with a population of about 600 households, all living in tiled brick bungalows.</p>
<h3>Suspicions in the Wusong Female Corpse Case</h3>
<p>Although the body was found in Wusong, there was no blood around it. The police attorney speculates that it may have been killed and the body abandoned in the wilderness. -Dai Yujin and Rao Bingnan are not allowed bail due to strong suspicion- Ding Shiwen, a concubine of a wealthy official from Yangzhou, was thirty-two years old. After coming to Shanghai, she first had an affair with Shi Wenlou, a fellow villager, and used her private savings to open the Nanjing Automobile Company. Later, she became involved with Rao Bingnan, an accountant from Anhui (the Lao Bingnan mentioned in yesterday's newspaper). Recently, after learning that Rao had become acquainted with a prostitute named Lao Qi, she realized that she was getting old and losing her beauty and could not compete for favor, so she often argued with Rao. Rao, unable to bear the harassment, was willing to give her 300 gold coins to sever their relationship. At 11 p.m. on the 10th of this month, the woman suddenly received a phone call, telling her to go to a hotel near the Great World to collect the money. Unexpectedly, after she left, she passed away from this world. The next day, on the west side of the Wusong Fort</p>
<h3>Radio Station</h3>
<p>On the wasteland nearby, a murdered female corpse was found. At that time, it was not yet known that it was Ding Shiwen, so the court of Shanshan examined the body and immediately ordered the charitable hall to provide a coffin. It was not until the day before yesterday that Wang Zhang, the deceased's cousin, and She Chaoxiang, from the She Zhengji Barber Shop on Weihaiwei Road, went to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau of Wusong to declare the deceased's brief history. The bureau then sent detectives to Shanghai to request the Chengdu Road Police Station to send additional Chinese and Western detectives to the Yanzi Nest (Swallow's Nest) set up by the deceased at No. 10 Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road, where they arrested the suspect Dai Yujin. Then, together with detectives from the French Concession Police Station, they rushed to the New York Automobile Company at No. 29 Rue Sainte-Marie to arrest Rao Bingnan and detain him for questioning. This information was detailed in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police sent</p>
<h3>Dai and Rao</h3>
<p>To the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi conducted the trial. Xin Jingsheng, a detective from the Wusong Public Security Bureau, went to the court to request a transfer. First, Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the Municipal Council, stated the circumstances of the body's discovery and the Public Security Bureau's request for assistance in arresting the criminals, which were generally the same as reported in the newspaper. Attorney Zhang also stated that according to Dai Yujin's confession to the police, the deceased came to his house at 11 p.m. on the 10th, saying that he was going to Suzhou and asked him to take care of his Yanzi Nest, so he went to No. 10 Dazhong Lane. As for Rao Bingnan, he only admitted that he had a relationship with the deceased, but denied murder. The suspicious point in this case is that around the place where the body was found,</p>
<h3>There is no blood</h3>
<p>So whether the murder took place there, or whether it was killed in another location and the body abandoned there, needs to be thoroughly investigated. Today, the Public Security Bureau is requesting a transfer. If the court believes that further investigation is needed, please postpone the hearing to allow for investigation. Next, detective Xin reported the circumstances of the body's discovery, saying that the body was wearing an Indian silk gown, white striped pants, and blue shoes, and its attire was very fashionable. Both eyes had knife wounds, and there were even more knife wounds on the face, with the wound on the corner of the forehead being the deepest. The blood that flowed out</p>
<h3>Has turned black</h3>
<p>And has congealed, indicating that the time of the murder was not short from the time of discovery. Moreover, there are no traces to be found around the body, suggesting that the murder did not take place there. According to She Zhengxiang's voluntary confession, he used to smoke opium in the deceased's Yanzi Nest. At around 11 p.m. on the 10th, someone called the deceased, reportedly telling her to go somewhere to collect money. The deceased then changed into a long gown and left. Later, seeing the newspaper report that a murdered female corpse was found in Wusong, the clothing described was very similar to the deceased's, so he and the deceased's cousin took a photo to the Wusong Public Security Bureau to verify the photo of the corpse taken by the bureau, and it was indeed correct. Wang Zhang, the deceased's cousin, also</p>
<h3>Voluntarily Confessed</h3>
<p>Once, questioned Dai Yujin's confession that he knew Ding Shiwen and that at 11 p.m. on the 10th, she came to his sister-in-law Chen Guiyou's house at No. 351 Datiebang to visit him. At that time, he was lying at the door, and she said that she was going to Suzhou with Shi Acai (i.e., Shi Wenlou) and planned to go to Pingjin from Suzhou, entrusting him to take care of her Yanzi Nest. He went to No. 10 Dazhong Lane that night, and if he had also participated in the murder, he would not have turned himself in. Rao Bingnan confessed that the deceased was Shi Wenlou's wife, and he only knew her,</p>
<h3>There is no affair</h3>
<p>However, the deceased and Wenlou have had deep resentment recently, and there was even a lawsuit last year. When the two of them set up a small general club in the French Concession, he often went to gamble, and Wenlou treated him like a thorn in his side. But at 9 p.m. on the 10th, he was asleep, and he did not know about the deceased's murder. He also retained a lawyer to claim that the defendant is currently an accountant for four automobile companies, including New York, and these four companies are willing to guarantee the defendant and request permission to be released on bail. Judge Wu believed that the case was related to human life and did not approve the request, ordering the two defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for further investigation.</p>
<h3>A Sea of People</h3>
<p>When the reporter arrived at the destination, they saw about a hundred people, old and young, men and women, waiting to see the strange figure, standing in the scorching sun, waiting to see the so-called strange figure. Most of these people who came to see the strange figure were people from nearby towns, and there were also many modern men and women who came here specifically from Shanghai, because the newspaper reported that this strange figure would definitely appear every day from 2 to 3 p.m. At this time, the reporter squeezed through the crowd to the entrance of the Yang family's house and saw that the double doors were tightly closed. They wanted to go inside to knock on the door and ask the owner about the truth, but it was impossible. They waited until 5 p.m., but still did not see anything, and the onlookers all shouted that they had been deceived and dispersed one after another.</p>
<h3>There is a Reason</h3>
<p>The reporter also inquired with a shop assistant at a nearby grocery store, but could not find any real evidence after a thorough investigation. According to reports, a week ago, two figures resembling farmers rushed out of the Land Temple, pointing to the roof of the Yang family's house and shouting that there was a ghost. The neighbors gathered to watch, but there was nothing different. When asked where the ghosts were, they said that they had seen two figures on the roof from the Land Temple, one male and one female, one wearing a blue cloth long gown and the other wearing a white top and black pants, holding hands and moving freely. At that time, more and more spectators gathered, and they dispersed without any results. The next day, many people came again at the same time, looking up and watching. Some said they had seen it, and some said they had not seen any figures, and no one could agree. Suddenly, a young man wearing a short shirt and pants resolutely climbed onto the roof to investigate, but then shouted that there was nothing and jumped down. He also gained nothing that day and dispersed. Since then, the neighbors have been gossiping, and therefore there are countless people who come to watch every day. What the truth is remains a mystery. If you say there is such a thing, there is no way to prove it.</p>
<h3>The Yang Family</h3>
<p>According to the residents of the town, it is said that there is a fox spirit named Yang Xingchu, with a wife and children, who started as a farmer and has accumulated some savings. Last autumn, a fox spirit was discovered, but his family claimed not to know. Now, the appearance of strange figures may be the work of a fox spirit. The legend is like this, but the reporter dares not believe it deeply.</p>
<h3>Elderly Man's Speculation</h3>
<p>At that time, an elderly man about sixty years old, named Chu Maozhi, who was said to be a reflection of the wall, was beside him and told the East China News Agency reporter that, according to his (i.e., Chu's) speculation, it must be caused by the reflection of the side wall. Generally, laborers, walking under such a scorching sun, their eyesight will inevitably be blurred, so the reflection of black and white walls can be seen from a distance, but it will definitely not be seen when close to it. If it is a cloudy day or the sunlight is not strong, there will be no such shadow. Therefore, the theory of ghosts and monsters is absolutely unbelievable.</p>
<p>Wang Dafang is Pitiful</p>
<h3>Dying as a Ghost in a Foreign Land</h3>
<p>Someone Owing Money Does Not Show Up. Travel Expenses Are Exhausted, Resentment Leads to Suicide. Wang Dafang, a native of Ningbo, 29 years old, lived in his hometown and worked as a farmer. Recently, due to poor farming and minimal gains, it was difficult to maintain his daily expenses, so he thought of a friend, Mr. Jia, who had borrowed money from him in Shanghai, so he rashly went to Shanghai alone to visit Mr. Jia to ask for the debt. Unexpectedly, when he arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Jia avoided meeting him. He went to his door several times, but he never met him. As a result, Wang did not carry much travel expenses, and they were all used up. Wang was unfamiliar with the place and had no way to borrow money, so he thought about the difficulty of returning home and that he could not stay in Shanghai, and was filled with resentment. He suddenly had the idea of ​​despairing of the world, so he went somewhere to buy opium and secretly swallowed it on the way. While wandering on the road, he suddenly met a fellow villager and friend, Zhang Zilong (who works as an old steward at the Gongda Fruit Shop at No. 216 Wusong Road), who told him the situation. At this moment, Zhang suddenly saw his complexion change and he swayed as if he could hardly stand. He quickly accompanied him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. Then, the body was carried to the Philen Road autopsy room. Yesterday morning, Tang, the prosecutor assigned by the First Special District Local Court, together with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, went to the autopsy room to examine the body. Zhang Zilong's statement was taken, and he also said that he was willing to collect the body. Mr. Tang then ordered the autopsy to determine that the deceased, Wang Dafang, male, had indeed died from opium poisoning during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his friend Zhang Zilong to collect and bury after signing a guarantee.</p>

<h3>Groundbreaking Ceremony for the New Site of Hudong Hospital</h3>
<p>Hudong Hospital in Yangshupu, this port, was founded more than ten years ago. Under the planning and management of Dr. Sheng Qingcheng, the director of the hospital, it has gradually expanded. Most of the residents in the area are hardworking workers. Mr. Sheng's charitable medical treatment is praised by everyone. In recent years, the business has developed rapidly. A hospital has been rebuilt near the old site. The groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled to be held in the coming days. Mayor Wu Tiecheng personally wrote the foundation stone, with the goal of completing and opening the hospital by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Citizens of the French Concession</p>
<h3>Continuing Report on Opposition to Water and Electricity Price Increase</h3>
<p>The Municipal Federation's Fifth Branch Sends a Letter to the Municipal Council The shops and citizens of the French Concession in this port are protesting against the French-owned water and electricity company's recent sudden change in the water and electricity supply rules, which increases the deposit by several times, making it difficult to bear the burden. The details are recorded in various newspapers. It is now known that the Fifth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the French Municipal Council yesterday, requesting that it carefully consider withdrawing its approval of the change of rules to comply with public opinion. The original letter is recorded below: To the Municipal Council, According to the joint letter from Zhonghua Factory, Xiuxintang, Ruichang, Lu Dachang, Hushun, Meiman, Xiangli, and Dasheng甡, the member stores of our association on Caishi Road, that businesses have suffered from the sluggish market in recent years, and business has been slow, making it extremely difficult to maintain. Unexpectedly, the French-owned water and electricity company has changed the rules and increased the deposit, and announced that the contract will be implemented from July of this year. It is said that this kind of increase in deposit is tantamount to a disguised price increase. Water and electricity are public utilities of society, and their main purpose is to seek convenience for citizens, not to be compared with other businesses that can seek profit and are greedy and insatiable. Moreover, the company's annual profit is millions. In the current situation of commercial depression and economic recession, it ignores everything, only seeks to increase profits, and acts arbitrarily. Businesses find it difficult to recognize this disguised price increase and should request your association to negotiate reasonably to achieve the cancellation of the new rules and continue to operate according to the old rules to bear the burden, etc. According to this, in recent years, the market has been depressed, prices have fallen, and the social economy has been declared bankrupt. It is a universally recognized fact in the world. Under this situation, it is urgent to find ways to provide relief in order to try to save it. However, the company has increased the burden on citizens, and public utilities, especially profitable companies, arbitrarily disguised price increases, which is unreasonable. Therefore, we specifically request your council to carefully consider and quickly revoke the approval of the change of rules, and order the company to continue to operate according to the old rules to comply with public opinion and appease the residents. We are anxiously waiting for your response.</p>
<p>Outdoor Swimming Pool</p>
<h3>Closing Time Advanced</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the gradually cooler weather, the Shanghai Municipal Council's outdoor swimming pool has been set to restore the previous hours from the 20th of this month, closing at 8 p.m. The same rules will apply to private groups renting during the open hours from August 20th.</p>
<p>Apply</p>
<h3>Overcrowding at Wing On Bank</h3>
<p>Six Hundred Applicants... Twelve Admitted</p>
<p>In recent years, the economy has been sluggish, there is a surplus of labor, and it is extremely difficult to find a job. This time, Wing On Bank recruited trainees with generous benefits. It was expected that the competition would be fierce. Yesterday, I met with the person in charge of the bank and inquired about the recruitment situation. He said that during the application period, the number of applicants approved for the examination after qualification review reached 600, including many high school and university graduates. Initially, because the number of admissions was small, it was planned to close the application period. However, due to the bank's reputation, it had to end the application period as scheduled. Unexpectedly, the situation was so grand, which shows the urgency of society's need for jobs. Our bank concentrates its capital and talents, and strives to serve the public. Therefore, the bank's general manager, Mr. Ou Jiancheng, attached great importance to this examination and formed a separate committee to be fair and impartial, and there was absolutely no favoritism. It is also planned to select outstanding students from those admitted to immediately assign them to positions, cultivate true talents, and seek truth from facts, eliminating the bad habit of perfunctory publicity. Although limited by the number of places, it is inevitable that some talents will be missed, but those who pass the reserve list still have the opportunity to be recorded for future use. It is now scheduled to hold the examination simultaneously at the YMCA and the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association on the 19th. The morning sessions will be for mathematics and English, and the afternoon sessions will be for Chinese and abacus. The seating arrangements will be made according to the latest methods to maintain order. Once the evaluation is completed, the results will be published in the Shen Bao.</p>
<h3>Inhumane</h3>
<h3>Rape and Trafficking of a Virgin Case</h3>
<p>Lu Yongquan's Viciousness Deserves Condemnation</p>
<p>Lu Yongquan, a 25-year-old man from Suzhou, lured Zhao Ruiying, a 17-year-old girl, from Nanqiao, Wuxi, to Shanghai at the end of the lunar first month of this year, and raped her in a room at the Nanyang Hotel. Her innocence was defiled, and she was repeatedly raped for three nights, arbitrarily abused. However, because Zhao Ruiying was young and had not fully developed, and was repeatedly tortured, her lower body was injured, she was exhausted, and suffered great pain. Because she was living in a foreign land and had no relatives to turn to, she was afraid to call for help because Lu threatened her with words. By the fourth night, Lu Yongquan still planned to continue the rape, but Zhao Ruiying could no longer endure it, and with tears in her eyes, she begged him bitterly, which finally prevented the rape. The next day, Lu placed the girl in the home of his sister at No. 20 Guanren Lane, Tangjia Nong, and repeatedly tried to sell her, but did not get the chance. Recently, Lu Yongquan and a habitual p</p>
<h3>On the Content of Works (Continued)</h3>
<p>—Answer to Mr. Li Qiushi— According to our opinion, the "content" of a work, as commonly said, does not simply refer to the theme and the material. All things in society, before being selected by the author, are called materials, or subject matter. Once selected, they become the theme. Material and theme are not two separate entities within a work. The material does not have a direct relationship with the artistic value of the work; it is the theme that does. However, neither can be said to be the "content." That is, a work cannot be considered to have content simply because it has a theme, characters, setting, and a developing story. Content is the artistic value that the theme has achieved through form (and artistic value is contained within social value). Content itself includes artistic value. When we criticize a mediocre work for having substantial content, we mean that the work is meaningful; not only is the theme relevant to reality, but also the production can bring out the positiveness of the theme. Conversely, if a work, even if it has characters, but they are dead characters, not living characters of the present society; even if it has a theme, but it is some dregs of society, not bloody facts of the present society, then our criticism that the work has no content or empty content is by no means (a malicious obliteration). We would not recognize life in a Buddha statue dressed in robes, which is clear to everyone. In fact, how can we say that a living dead person who dares not look directly at the world and can only eat, sleep, and have children has life? Life does not refer to the five senses and four limbs, nor is it merely eating and sleeping; it refers to the active pursuit of survival by people on the battlefield of the present society, which is meaningful to human society. The content of a work is the same. When we criticize a novel about a sailor raping a girl, which is all the same, with one sentence, "(no content)", it is not a wrong, because this kind of subject matter is fundamentally the residue of society, and does not contain any artistic value. When we criticize the supernatural and chivalrous novels that fill the market with one sentence, "(no content)", it is also not a wrong, because the themes of those works do not contain reality, and the characters there are only characters (in heaven but not on earth). Therefore, content is neither (theme) nor (material), but the essence of the work that is included in the form and attached with artistic value (social value).</p>
<p>Theorists who believe that works without content have not yet appeared in China are intentionally obliterating content and setting up a guise for form, that is, formalists. They believe that form is everything, and that all things in society can be regarded as the content of a work, as long as they are depicted sufficiently and handled properly. May I ask, can a fool be transformed into a lively and intelligent person through decoration? Impossible! The clay-sculpted and wood-carved Buddha statue, no matter how much you gild it, will still be a clay-sculpted and wood-carved Buddha statue. This illustrates that content determines form, and form cannot determine content. Even if we take a step back, the so-called whether the description is sufficient and whether the handling is proper is not a simple technical issue, and still cannot but be attributed to content. For example, when depicting the disaster in China, some can deeply depict the overall picture of the disaster, while others can only touch on the superficial aspect. What is the reason for this? This contains the issue of the author's genuine and ungenuine understanding of reality. Understanding is the driving force that constitutes the content of a work. Is it not daydreaming to expect an author who does not have a genuine understanding of reality to be able to describe it sufficiently? Works without content in China are filling the entire literary world, and progressive critics should also start from the content of the work, to cut off the works without content or with empty content.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Records of Customs and Scenery of Miao Region (II)</h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>The clothes of the Miao people in the three counties of Fenghuang, Qiancheng, and Yongcheng in Hunan are all made of black cloth, both upper and lower garments being the same. Those who use red cloth for their belts are called Red Miao by the locals; those who wrap their feet with black cloth are called Black Miao; those who wrap their feet with blue or white cloth are called Green Miao and White Miao. The White Miao wear pleated clothes with embroidered flowers, and those who also use them for foot wrapping are called Flowery Miao. According to local records, in the past, they were all collectively called Red Miao, and those referred to as Black Miao by the locals are so-called because of the deep black color of the Miao clothes. As for using red belts, flowery belts around the waist, and wrapping feet with blue or white cloth, it is their old custom, passed down unchanged, not adding Black Miao, Green Miao, White Miao, Flowery Miao and other types besides the Red Miao. However, the costumes of the Miao people residing in the two counties of Xishui and Songtao in Guizhou are quite clean, and they like to wear white cloth shirts. They all wear them for beauty during weddings and celebrations. According to the Miao borderlands, there were Bai Man in the past, so these Miao people are probably their descendants? The Miao people only have their village chiefs shave their heads, and the rest all wear their hair in topknots, remove their beards, wear short clothes, bare their feet, wear blue cloth shirts, occasionally use black cloth trousers, tie red belts around their waists, and also favor red collars. The edges of their clothes are all embroidered with colorful flowers on the edges. The wealthy bind their hair with net scarves, insert four or five silver hairpins, wear two silver rings on the back of their heads, wear a silver ring as big as a bowl in their left ear, surround their necks with silver rings, wear silver bracelets on their hands, and wear tin skin on their clothes, wrap blue cloth leggings, although their feet are as thick as animal paws, they can walk through dry roots in the morning and rush through green mustard, as agile as monkeys, this is the stunt of the Miao people. Their women's silver hairpins, neck rings, hand bracelets, and leggings are all like men's, except that their ears are pierced with three, four, or five silver rings, always to boast wealth with quantity. Their clothes are longer than men's and decorated with tin sheets, red velvet, or embroidered flowers. They wear silver combs on their heads, tightly wrapping their hair with silver threads, wrapping it with blue embroidered scarves, tying a belt under their waists, and wearing cloth or cotton skirts on their lower bodies, with blue and red stripes and embroidered round flowers for decoration, and some also tie tin bells and embroidered velvet flowers for decoration. Miao girls who are unmarried part their forehead hair in the middle, tie their braids to the back, and decorate them with tin bells, sea shellfish, and medicine beads. The Miao people wear only two or three layers of single clothing in the deep winter and severe cold, without wearing cotton wadding, hunching over and staggering in the wind and rain, whether rich or poor. The Miao people eat two meals a day, and three meals in spring and summer, with millet, corn, and other miscellaneous grains as food, and they eat all vegetables raw, drink creek water when thirsty, value fish when they get them, and treasure salt when they get it. When they get salt, they always lick it in their palms as a delicacy. Livestock meat is singed to remove its hair, cooked and eaten, without knowing the five flavors. When guests arrive, they boil ginger and pepper soup to show respect. The Miao people do not have the custom of not marrying within the same surname, but relatives are not matched either. When a wedding is completed, the bride sleeps with her mother, and the groom must give the bride's mother silver before she leaves, called "mother money," also known as "milk money," usually no more than three or two taels. Wealthy families, seeing that other Miao people have beautiful daughters, order their sons to pull their backs, called "grabbing a bride." The girl's family also benefits from it, and will not promise her to anyone else. After that, they also go through matchmakers, negotiate the bride price and gifts. If a virgin has relations with someone, her parents know but do not prohibit it, but instead think that people love her beauty. If someone offends his wife or concubine, they will raise their blades against each other, and must get money to redeem themselves before it is over. If the husband and wife do not get along, the husband abandons his wife and marries another, and the wife abandons her husband and marries another, without prohibition.</p>
<p>In the summer, Miao people of both genders bathe together in the river. When women see guests, they only protect their breasts with their hands, and do not avoid anything else.</p>
<p>Miao men and women both engage in farming. There are more mountains than fields, and few are suitable for growing grains. They always burn bushes, cultivate mountain slopes, and plant sesame, millet, wheat, beans, corn, sorghum, buckwheat, and other miscellaneous grains. After planting for three or four years, they abandon the land and cultivate elsewhere, because the cultivated land is barren. After abandoning it for several years, the soil fertility is restored, and they still cultivate it.</p>
<p>When the Miao people go out, they must carry baskets on their waists and backs. The baskets are made of bamboo, with two ropes on the sides that are threaded through both shoulders. In autumn, they harvest miscellaneous grains, and at other times, they carry firewood. When carrying heavy loads over long distances, they first use a back carry, made of wooden planks, shaped like a half frame, placed behind the neck, attached to the shoulders, and threaded with ropes to tie to the head, and then carry the basket on their backs. Therefore, the basket is always with them.</p>
<p>The women in the Miao region also know how to raise silkworms, but they do not know how to cultivate seeds. In the spring, when silkworms come out from the people, they go in groups with baskets to exchange goods for them. After raising them to cocoon, they draw silk, dye it, and make skirts and quilts, making square knots and miscellaneous patterns in their leisure time, but they are not as exquisite as the Tujia brocade of Yongshun and Baojing in Hunan, which makes cranes, phoenixes, flowers, and birds with more skill.</p>
<h3>Salute and Donkey Bellows</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>In the General's Tower of the Tannenberg Memorial, the German hero—Hindenburg!—lies in peace. When his state funeral was held, a 101-gun salute was fired. The grandeur and solemnity of the funeral was rare in modern Europe!</p>
<p>Hindenburg had performed military service in Tannenberg during his lifetime, and he was accustomed to the sound of cannons! Now, he is buried in a place closely related to the glory of his life, and a 101-gun salute is fired to comfort his heroic soul, which can be said to be extremely appropriate.</p>
<p>In China, although there are not many who can be called heroic souls, there are ways to comfort the souls of the deceased, but not with salutes, because the souls of the deceased cannot withstand fright, while the subtle blowing and drumming of monks and Taoists (funeral music) is quite agreeable to them. This is the difference in qualifications between the (heroic) and (deceased) souls!</p>
<p>At the end of the Han Dynasty, Wang Can, the King of Wei, liked donkey bellows. After he was buried, Cao Pi went to his funeral and turned to his companions and said, "Zhongxuan liked donkey bellows. Let's each make a sound to comfort him." The mourners all made a donkey bellow, which is a special anecdote that is unprecedented and unsurpassed. Imagining the expressions on their faces when they raised their voices to make a donkey bellow cannot help but make people laugh. And the fact that Cao Pi thought that this method was needed to comfort Wang Can's soul can be considered a strange person and strange event!</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought of modern society. If you throw silver coins clangingly on the grave of that kind of friend who is "(reaching out from the coffin)," it may be a way to comfort the (greedy soul)!</p>
<h3>Biography of Ma Longsheng</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Ma Longsheng, also known as Monk, was a gatekeeper at a school in Songjiang. Although he was a school worker, he dressed very fashionably, with gold teeth and a western-style haircut. He had all kinds of clothing, from homespun cloth shirts and trousers, flannel long gowns to fur coats and foreign overcoats, and the styles were very modern. People who didn't know him suspected that he was a young master from some mansion!</p>
<p>One day, a parent named Zhu came to see his son, and this parent was a (bumpkin). When he saw Longsheng, he thought that he was a teacher at the school, so he bowed to him solemnly and asked, "Sir! Is Zhu ×× here?" At that time, this joke spread throughout the school, "(Sir, is Zhu ×× here?)" could be heard everywhere. It is said that this Zhu ×× was a handsome western-dressed youth, and he was so embarrassed that he couldn't face anyone because of this incident.</p>
<p>Although Longsheng was so handsome and so modern, he had no knowledge in his belly, and he was completely a straw bag and tattered cotton wadding. One day, the office posted a notice in the gatehouse: "(Smoking is prohibited in this room because there are many villains...)" When Longsheng saw it, he recited: "(This room, many villains, prohibit giving birth to smoking...)" After reading it, he was furious, "(The office is really inhumane. Although we are workers, we have great ambitions, and they actually regard us as villains. It is unreasonable to prohibit smoking! It is unreasonable!)"</p>
<p>At that time, he summoned all the school workers to hold a general meeting to launch a punitive expedition against the office. At the meeting, Longsheng presided, and after stating the purpose of the meeting, he posted the notice for everyone to see, and his words of anger overflowed from his expression. When the notice was passed to Ah Lin, who printed the lecture notes, he smiled and said, "Longsheng! You are wrong. The office's notice should be read like this: '(Smoking is prohibited in this room because there are many people...)'. It is to prevent fire, not '(This room, many villains, prohibit giving birth to smoking...)'. That way it doesn't make sense." So everyone laughed and dismissed the meeting, but Longsheng's face turned red. He said, "(I'm afraid not, right?)"</p>
<p>Recently, a letter from Sheng Jun mentioned that Longsheng is going to take the training course for sailors at the Ministry of Communications (?). I think that soon our China will have one more maritime talent.</p>

<p>According to investigations: There are about 1,500 private prostitutes in Tokyo, Japan, and 6,000 public prostitutes. There are even more café girls, about 30,000 or more. Among them, about 400 have a high school education, 50 have a university education, 350 have a higher elementary school education, and the most, 650, have a lower elementary school education.</p>
<p>Someone said: The height of a woman's personality and the heels of the shoes she wears are inversely proportional. This also has some truth.</p>
<p>According to a survey in Tokyo, Japan: there are 16,000 working women in Tokyo. Among them, only 23 have a monthly salary of more than 100 yuan, followed by reporters with 53 yuan, and female supervisors have 50 yuan per month. The average monthly salary is 30 yuan and 70 cents.</p>
<h3>Records of Royal Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Qing Deling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This leather belt is about four or five feet long, and it is full of small bells, so no matter where the eunuch who specializes in serving the dog takes it, it is not difficult to find it immediately; if it is happy to run faster or more urgently, the bell sound can be heard even in a distant place.</p>
<p>Readers, don't underestimate the eunuch who specializes in serving this (royal dog). His duties are indeed troublesome enough, and the responsibility is extremely heavy. For example, he has to personally prepare the food that the dog eats. - Hailong's food is of course very exquisite, and it is often changed, but what it eats the most is liver, mixed with gravy, and mixed with freshly cooked white rice. - After preparing it, it has to be sent to Zhang De to take a look and decide whether it is good or not; but Zhang De dared to take such a big responsibility. Each time, he respectfully held the bowl of dog food and went to the Empress Dowager to ask for instructions. The Empress Dowager not only did not take it as an offense, but also carefully checked it. If she found anything that was not right, such as disliking the rice being undercooked, disliking the liver being not fresh enough, disliking the gravy being too little, etc., she would never let it go, and would definitely ask them to take it back and redo it; in this way, the eunuch in charge of the door dog would not be spared a scolding from Zhang De, and even the chefs in the royal kitchen would suffer the same rebuke.</p>
<p>I still remember very clearly that the eunuch who served the dog always pretended to be solemn and serious, holding the huge bamboo basket and standing in the corner of the carriage. On the way, whenever the car stopped for a longer period of time, when we all got off the car to take a leisurely walk, he often brought the bamboo basket down as well. First, he carefully placed the basket on the ground, and then gently took Hailong out of the basket, tied on the leather belt full of countless small bells, and let it take a walk. Usually, the person leading the dog is the person leading the dog, but this eunuch would never dare to be so bold. He can only be led by the dog, that is, always obey the dog's wishes. If it wants to go east, then he goes east, and if it wants to go west, then he goes west. Only in the most urgent cases would he dare to make any decisions. (107)</p>

<h3>Speaking on Eercock Road</h3>
<p>— Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>Starting from the location of the Ward Road Prison, going north, slightly west, you can go straight to the east end of Yuezhou Road, near the boundary of the Public Concession, which is Eercock Road.</p>
<p>Eercock Road is not a road that can be said to be quite long. On the contrary, it should be considered a short road that seems insignificant, but from the perspective of the history of the Concession, there is something worth saying. Originally, the section south of the intersection with Tangshan Road belonged to the area of ​​the American Concession expanded in 1893 (the nineteenth year of Guangxu), while the section north of it was included in the newly opened so-called International Public Concession in 1899 (the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu).</p>
<p>The road is like this, but the person commemorated by the road name has more historical significance. It is no exaggeration to say that he is one of the most important people in the history of the Concession.</p>
<p>Eercock Alcock, in older Chinese books, is translated as Aliguo, and the first character has an additional mouth character, indicating the meaning of transliteration. His name is Rutherford. Later, because his work in China was praised by the British government, he was given the title of (Sir); although on the other hand, Chinese authors called him (the British consul with the worst relationship with Chinese merchants).</p>
<p>Yes, Rutherford. Eercock was the second British consul in Shanghai after the opening of the five ports for trade between China and Britain. After he took office as consul in 1846 (the twenty-sixth year of Daoguang), the things he did are truly endless to write about.</p>
<p>Although the purchase of the base of the British Consulate on the Bund was initiated by the first British Consul, Balfour, it was Eercock who continued to negotiate and finally obtained the approval of the British government. It was also Eercock who negotiated with Shanghai Daolin Gui to expand the British Concession area from 830 acres to 2,820 acres.</p>
<p>The implementation of this expansion of the British Concession area was in 1848 (the twenty-eighth year of Daoguang). In the same year, a conflict occurred in Qingpu between a British clergyman and local residents and grain boat sailors. The injured clergyman returned to Shanghai, and the British Consul Eercock personally visited Shanghai Daowang Shaofu, demanding punishment and compensation. The Shanghai Dao said: "(Minor fights and brawls are not worth investigating deeply.)" Eercock was furious when he heard this, and his words offended the Daotai. He happened to be holding a long-handled folding fan, so he raised the fan and hit the Daotai's head. The Daotai flicked his sleeves and entered, and said to Jin Xian, the magistrate of Shanghai County: "(Mixed residence of Chinese and foreigners, fights and brawls between civilians, this is a very small matter. I will never oppress my own people to please foreigners.)" However, not only was the Daotai's head hit for nothing, but later, because Eercock sent someone to Nanjing to appeal to the Governor-General of Liangjiang, Ji Lixingyuan, ten sailors from Qingpu were finally paraded on the Bund with cangues, and 200 taels of compensation were obtained.</p>
<p>Eercock's personality was so fierce. Later, after the rise of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Concession adopted a policy of so-called armed neutrality, revised its land regulations on its own, and organized the Shanghai Municipal Council—Eercock was indeed a driving force in these important historical events that marked the beginning of the Concession's transformation into its current state. Perhaps because of this, he was promoted to British Minister to China. After becoming Minister, he took the initiative on another matter of great importance to the Shanghai Concession. Originally, during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period, the actions of the Shanghai Concession authorities were strongly displeased by the British Minister to China, Bruce, and the American Minister, Burlingame, who did not hesitate to instruct their Shanghai Consul "(with the attitude of teaching elementary school students)," to no avail, and then submitted it to the diplomatic corps, which passed five principles for reorganizing the Concession. This was in 1864 (the third year of Tongzhi). Later, the taxpayers of the Concession revised the land regulations, incorporating one of the five principles, namely, adding a Chinese advisory committee to the Shanghai Municipal Council, into the draft regulations. However, in the land regulations approved by the diplomatic corps in 1865 (the eighth year of Tongzhi), that provision was deleted. Why? It was because Bruce, the British Minister, and Burlingame, the American Minister, who were quite mindful of Chinese sovereignty, had left their posts one after another, and that kind of Eercock had become the British Minister.</p>
<p>If you take a walk on Eercock Road, wouldn't the entire history of the Concession unfold in your mind?</p>

<h3>Conference of Middle School Principals</h3>
<p>▲ Chiang Kai-shek Sends a Telegram Instructing to Focus Efforts on Practical Education ▲ Elected Persons in Charge to Divide into Four Groups to Review Proposals (Hankou Correspondence) In order to improve secondary education and restore local education, the Hubei Department of Education specially convened a conference of principals of public and private middle schools throughout the province. The opening ceremony was held at the Department of Education on the 15th. More than 100 principals attended. Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Three Provinces Suppressing Bandits, personally came to give instructions. Cheng Qibao, Director of the Department of Education, presided over the meeting, reported on the purpose, and read telegrams from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Minister Wang Shijie. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram stated: "(To Director Cheng of the Department of Education in Wuchang, secondary education is the most important key to cultivating youth's academic and moral character. We should focus all our efforts on practical education and character education, and transform their lives, so as to correct today's malpractices. I hope that all principals will pay close attention to it, personally set an example, in order to change the atmosphere, and lay a solid foundation for the revitalization of the nation.

<h3>Investigation of the Huizhou Dialect</h3>
<p>The Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica considers the Southern Anhui dialect as a self-contained system. This spring, it solicited native speakers from six counties in Shanghai to record the general system of pronunciation. Subsequently, on June 19th, Researcher Luo Xintian and Assistant Yang Shifeng of the institute arrived in Tunxi from Hangzhou. On July 9th, Zhao Yuanren, the director of the Linguistics Group, also sent a new portable recording device from Shanghai to Tunxi. Nearly two months have passed. According to a dispatch from She County yesterday, the reporter asked Mr. Luo Xintian at the Girls' Primary School on South Street about the results of this investigation. According to Mr. Luo, "I arrived in Tunxi on June 19th, and it has been almost two months. During this time, the work can be divided into four stages. After arriving in Tunxi, due to frequent banditry and inconvenient transportation in Qi and Wu counties, it was decided to invite representatives from Tunxi, Xiuning, Qimen, and Yi counties to record nearby. From June 21st to July 8th, we recorded eleven dialects from Shiken in the eastern township of Qimen, Zhukou in the western township, Chawan in the southern township, and Liudu in the northern township; Xiaoqi Shangtan in the eastern township of Wuyuan, Renhong in the western township; the city of Yi County and Badu; Changganbang in the eastern township of Xiuning; and Wangchuan in the northern township of Jixi. Later, Mr. Zhao Yuanren arrived in Tunxi on July 9th, bringing the latest Fairchild portable recording device to prepare aluminum disc recordings. He also took the opportunity to visit Huangshan for four days while traveling to Xiubei Lantian and Shebei Tangkou. After returning to Tunxi on July 19th, Mr. Zhao returned to Shanghai due to business. This was the first stage of the work. After returning to Tunxi, the Tenth District Primary School Teachers' Summer Training Conference was held in Wan'an, with representatives from each county. It was very convenient for recording and disc production. I consulted with Commissioner Liu Jianzhong and, with his consent, went to Wan'an with Yang Shifeng and Cheng Youzhen on July 23rd, staying at the South Dormitory of the Second Middle School. Work began the next day and continued until August 1st. We continued to record sixteen dialects from the city of Qimen, Zhixia in Wuyuan, Yuting in Yi County, the city of Xiuning, Lanshan in the northern township, Shangxikou and the Thirty-third Division in the western township, Jingzhou in Jixi, and the Third, Fourth, and Fifteenth Divisions; Huangbei in Shuinan, Dazhouyuan Shang, and Xinzhuang in Hanan, Kengshang in Shangxi township, and Fengkou in the northern township of She County. With the assistance of Mr. Yang Shifeng, more than eighty aluminum discs were recorded. This was the second stage of the work. After arriving in She County on August 5th, we prepared to supplement the recordings of the city of She County and the eastern township, and to make sound recordings. Soon after, we went to Jixi. This was the third stage of the work. The Jixi dialect can be divided into three major systems: the middle section, Dongyuan, and Lingbei. I had a slight understanding of this during my work in Tunxi and Wan'an. However, the area around Linxi in the Tenth Division has not yet been recorded, so I plan to conduct a field investigation in Jixi and collect vocabulary from the city. It is expected that everything will be completed by mid-August, after which I will go to Hangzhou and then to Beijing. This is the fourth stage of the work. In addition to the Fairchild recording device, the equipment brought this time also included a Kymograph for recording tone curves and a Dictaphone for making temporary wax cylinder recordings. The first uses self-supplied dry batteries and water batteries to power it, and the second uses a spring to power it. However, the third requires a stronger current, so the opportunity to use it is very small due to the inconvenience of electricity in the interior. Before I came to Huizhou, I was introduced by my old friend Mr. Xu Dushi to Mr. Xu Puren. The various conveniences in this work were greatly assisted by the two gentlemen Xu and Xu. In addition, the teachers of the Fourth Girls' School and the Second Middle School also provided us with much help. As for the native speakers, they sweated profusely in the sweltering heat to produce the sounds. Commissioner Liu Jianzhong and Mr. Zheng Yuyu assisted us in our work at the training conference. As we are about to leave Huizhou, we should express our sincere thanks." This city's middle school entrance examination make-up exam</p>

<h3>Methods for Schools to Screen Educational Films</h3>
<p>▲Departure will begin after the start of the semester ▲Fee collection in schools is quite good The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association, having submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to collect educational film fees from schools at all levels in this city, has announced the procedures. All schools have expressed their agreement with this measure, and the fee collection from students has been quite good. The association now plans to visit schools to screen the films after the start of the semester. The screening methods are listed below: (1) Each school must have blackout curtains in the screening venue to block sunlight. They must be prepared by the school itself. (2) The standard size of the screen is 3 meters high and 4 meters wide. In special circumstances, it can be adjusted according to the size of the screening venue. (3) Educational films will be screened once a month at each school. The dates will be determined by the association. (4) After the association has investigated and arranged everything, each school will include the scheduled screening time in the curriculum. (5) Once the screening time has been scheduled by the association, it should be implemented accordingly and should not be changed arbitrarily. Before each screening time, the equipment must be complete so that the association's equipment can be screened upon arrival, without delaying the screening time of other schools. (7) Schools with fewer than 100 students must combine with other schools to watch the films. (8) If there are too many students to accommodate all students in one screening, the number of screenings may be increased as appropriate, but each time should not exceed three screenings. Each screening should have at least 300 students. (9) If the screening is held on the playground, it must be in the evening. If it rains, the screening will be suspended.</p>

<h3>News from Various Schools</h3>
<p>▲Wuben Girls' Middle School The Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School is a girls' school with a long history. Since Ms. Yan Zhenyu took over last year, she has been working hard to improve all aspects of teaching and training. After recent research, it seems necessary to try to revise the teaching progress of each subject in order to ensure that the levels of each grade are uniform and that each subject develops equally. Preparations for the trial revision were made in the middle of last semester. The school investigated textbooks used by famous middle schools across the country and compiled statistics. During this summer vacation, the school invited teachers of each subject to separately study the goals, time allocation, teaching materials outline, and implementation plan of each subject, and decided on the textbooks and extracurricular assignments for each grade. It is reported that the Chinese and English subjects have been discussed in detail at a meeting convened by the Director of Academic Affairs, Chen Zhiduan, and Cao Juren (professor at Fudan Chizhi), Cao Xinhan (Secretary-General of the Law School), Lin Yulin (Director of the English Department of Zhonggong, professor at Xiamen Guanghua), Chen Youqin, and Yu Shiyi have been appointed to draft the papers. After the meeting, it was decided that the teachers hired by the school for each subject in the next semester were all famous professors who had previously taught at major middle schools. In addition to the above-mentioned teachers, there are also Ding Chenwei (lecturer at Fudan), Wang Rulin (professor at Guangda), Wang Zushun (teacher at Huilan Pudong), Yang Deyi (teacher at Pudong), Yang Xiantao (teacher at the Affiliated Middle School of Beijing Normal University), Guo Liangang (teacher at the YMCA Middle School), Zhang Weiyi (professor at the Law School), as well as Wang Changbao, a painter who studied in Belgium, and Gao Jingyi, a specialist in home economics who studied in Japan. As for the New Good Wife and Wise Mother Doctrine, since the school principal published her speech, the families have sent letters expressing their sympathy and offering their opinions. It is reported that Principal Yan has drafted a detailed plan and will announce it to the world after it has been revised. ▲Municipal Xinlu Normal School The Municipal Xinlu Normal School in this city, feeling the lack of labor teachers in various schools, has specially set up two groups for agricultural affairs and crafts, and hired Shen Xiaoqiu and Zhu Yingsong as directors, and Wang Shixiang and Pan Gongwang as labor teachers. They have opened practice fields, increased labor equipment and teaching time, and manufactured daily necessities to conform to the true meaning of production education. They have also manufactured teaching aids for various subjects for teaching applications. Recently, Xu Wancheng, the manager of the Nan Shi Longwen Bookstore in Nanshi, contacted the school authorities to imitate the production of plant specimens and various teaching aids for various schools to choose and use. Moreover, Sheng Zhensheng, the principal of the school, has spared no effort in planning and operating the school. He has applied to the Bureau of Education for funds to build a new school building and reduce students' meal expenses. Therefore, when the first enrollment was held, there were three to four hundred applicants. The examination was strict, and only fifty to sixty students were admitted. Since thirty-four students are still not enough, a second entrance examination will be held at Wanzhu Elementary School in Nine Acres on the 18th, 19th, and 2nd of this month. ▲Zhonghua Morning and Night School The Zhonghua Morning and Night School at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Nanshi Road was founded by Dr. Song Ziqiang and has a history of more than ten years. Over the years, no less than a thousand graduates have been employed in various industries and are all competent. This semester, the school is even more eager to expand and has a thriving atmosphere. In addition to all the individual conversation, rapid English, and shorthand classes taught by Principal Song himself, for the needs of the community, a Chinese and English bookkeeping class has been specially added and Mr. Jin Diqing, a Bachelor of Commerce, has been hired to teach it. The class has also invited Mr. Go Ken Hiroshi from Tokyo University in Japan to teach Japanese, and Mr. Laimen from Germany to teach German. It is reported that the school has excellent methods and low fees. There are no additional fees for those who study in the morning and evening or continuously. There are also various scholarship and fee reduction methods. Individual tutoring is available at Room 506, 5th Floor, Lu Shang Place. Regulations can be obtained from Nanshi Road. ▲Peicheng Girls' School There has been a very enthusiastic response to applications to Peicheng Girls' School on Xiaoshadu Road in this city. The entrance examination for new students is scheduled for September 3rd and 4th, and classes will officially begin on the 10th. It is also learned that Ms. Ya'na, the British founder of the school, returned to China for personal reasons this spring. She has now returned to Shanghai on the Italian postal ship on the 4th of this month and will continue to teach classes. ▲Shanghai Girls' Middle School In order to improve the level and increase the efficiency of education, Shanghai Girls' Middle School on Zhizaoju Road in this city will implement a system of specialized teaching by subject starting this year. The teachers hired will generally be women. It is reported that the school has hired the following new teachers this semester: Ms. Ni Youfang, Bachelor of Laws from Great China University, former Director of Moral Education at Nansing Middle School in Xiamen; Ms. Wang Xiangpei, Bachelor of Commerce from National Shanghai College of Commerce; Ms. Yu Ying, Bachelor of National Wuhan University; Ms. Song Yiren, graduate of the Department of Home Economics of Hebei Provincial Women's Normal College; Ms. Wu Xunqi, Bachelor of Science from National Central University; Ms. Zhang Wanruo, Bachelor of Science from Great China University, etc. ▲Meihua Girls' Middle School Since its opening, Meihua Girls' Middle School at No. 61 Carter Road has achieved remarkable results. Recently, Principal Gu Jing, in view of the few expressions of national consciousness in general art exhibitions, plans to transport the works of teachers and students of the school that are related to the spirit of national progress to Beijing for exhibition around November of this year. If energy permits, the school's Arts and Drama Society will also stage the play "Xi Shi" written by Director of Academic Affairs Lin Wenzheng and the national songs composed by Professor Li Shuhua, as a general mobilization movement for all departments of art, in order to awaken national consciousness with the great power of art.

<h3>Children's Health Camp (1)</h3>
<p>Zhou Shang</p>
<p>▲ The strength and prosperity of China depend entirely on the health of its children ▲ Health camps are places to promote children's health ▲ The summer opportunity for your children should not be missed ▲ Family and school life within the camp should be adopted</p>
<p>The Shanghai Summer Children's Health Camp, modeled after summer camps in Europe and America (Summer Camp), evolved from open-air schools. The pioneer of open-air schools was the Chendengpan Open-Air Health School outside Berlin, Germany, in 1904. England and France followed suit in 1907, and the United States in 1908. At that time, the Nordic countries were running summer vacation colonies (Summer Vacailon Colonies). Although the history of such special education is short, its development has been as rapid as bamboo shoots after a rain. Last year, there were as many as 575 summer camps along the coast of the United States. In 1918, the United Kingdom promulgated Article 17 of the Education Ordinance, stipulating that local education authorities should establish or assist summer camps. In Japan, facilities such as vacation colonies and open classes have also become very popular. Youth associations and others in China have promoted summer camps in the past, but this camp, which is truly focused on health education, is just beginning to flourish. Knowing this, I, along with Dr. Sun Jiaqi, am in charge of this matter, so I go there often. I would like to inform the readers of its contents, so as to give considerable sympathy and protection to these tender young shoots. At the same time, we should also make this glory flourish for the happiness of our own children and those of our relatives and friends. Know that a short summer vacation accounts for one-eighth of the whole year, and even one-sixth of the school days. Leaving the densely populated city, far away from the humid and hot classrooms, coming to the countryside to absorb fresh air, basking in sunlight with sufficient ultraviolet rays, eating less dirty snacks, taking in more clean and nutritious products, and living a regular life are the best ways to improve children's health. Parents, don't miss this opportunity! China's assets lie only in its children, and China's strength and prosperity depend entirely on the health of its children. For individuals and families, for the country and the nation, the health of children must not be relaxed, and the life of a health camp must not be neglected.</p>
<p>▲ Zhaohe Middle School, located at the intersection of Labor Sheng Road and Binlang Road in this city, was originally established to commemorate the righteousness of the Zhaohe warship. It has always attached great importance to youth military training. Therefore, in the last semester, when the city held a general military training review, it won the second championship in the city's live ammunition shooting competition, which was praised for a time. The summer military training was postponed to the 9th of this month due to school relocation matters. The school has been implementing a militarized life in the school, which is quite serious. As for the autumn enrollment, the school has already conducted an examination at the beginning of the month. The number of places in the next semester will be expanded, and the admission will be strict, so there are still vacancies in various grades. Recently, the number of applicants has been increasing, and it is said that the entrance examination will be held on the morning of the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>▲ Admission qualifications: Any boy or girl aged seven to twelve, as long as they do not have any infectious diseases, can register to enter the camp. Children with malnutrition, physical weakness, physical and mental defects, anemia, neurasthenia, and those who have completed the isolation period after infectious diseases are even more welcome. Before entering the camp, they have undergone a detailed physical examination, signed and approved by a doctor, and then issued an admission certificate. With the certificate, they can enter the camp. The camp address is in the middle school department of National Tongji University in Wusong, facing the water and backing the village, with a quiet environment, green lawns, and tall buildings, suitable for hygiene. Each child lives there, as if entering a fairyland. At the beginning of the camp, there were 55 children. After the parents visited, they asked their children to participate. The camp has limited funds and manpower, so it only allowed four children to join. Those who came later inevitably regretted it, which is a pity.</p>
<p>▲ Medical work: The Health Bureau sent doctors Sun Jiaqi and Zhang Qi, and nurses Jiang Maofan and Chen Mingdao. The China Tuberculosis Prevention Association also sent nurses Shen Zongying and Zu Depei to stay in the camp to serve. Mr. Sun also serves as the general manager, guiding everything. (Health check): held once every morning. (Temperature measurement): twice in the morning and evening, so as to observe the cleanliness and physical condition of each child and prevent the occurrence and spread of diseases. The weight is also measured every week. Except for four children who maintained their original state, the rest have made progress, with the most gaining four pounds and the least gaining one pound. The results of the stool examination showed that eleven people had roundworms and one had liver fluke. All of these are harmful to the body. We often see children with yellow and thin faces, but we can't find out what's wrong. Most of them are caused by intestinal parasites. Teachers, staff and parents must pay attention to this. The children with roundworms have already started treatment in the camp. His method is to take laxative salt at 8:00 in the morning, Santonin medicine at 11:00, 12:00, and 1:00, and then take laxative salt again at 4:00 in the afternoon. On the morning of that day, you can use a bowl of milk or thin porridge, stop lunch, and have dinner as usual. Re-examine the stool two weeks later to see if it is completely cured. Various tests are recorded on forms, which are omitted here due to space constraints.</p>
<p>▲ Education situation: Here, we do not pay attention to ordinary education, but focus on hygiene habits, physical exercise, posture correction, temperament cultivation, vision protection, and special guidance such as stuttering. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, there is drawing and craftwork; every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, there is general knowledge, nature, and storytelling. Large muscle activities are held at 11:00 am every day, aiming to correct children's posture. Listen to the piano in peace before meals to satisfy mental health. Listen to the piano and play games from 3:30 pm to 4:00 pm. They attach great importance to outdoor education and have been to Baotaiwan, Ye Family Garden, nearby rural areas, and Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach. Two children told me that July 28 was the happiest day of their lives when they were in Gaoqiao. Stepping into the pond, learning to swim, picking up shells, collecting specimens, catching dragonflies, catching grasshoppers, catching butterflies, taking a boat, taking a car, eating bread, and drinking soda. The teacher also explained the principles of bathing and the necessity of internal and external cleanliness of the body. They said, their faces reflecting the comedy in their hearts. This kind of education is life education. I hope ordinary schools and our families will quickly grasp the psychology of children. Sports news</p>
<h3>Next North China Swimming Competition</h3>
<h3>To Be Held in Jinan</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: After the swimming competition of the North China Games closed the day before yesterday, the athletes from Hebei and Shandong teams left Beiping yesterday. The Qingdao athletes, led by Zhao Huacheng, will return to Qingdao at 4:30 pm today (14th). However, the female athletes He Wenjin and the Wen Ya Wenjing sisters, and their father Yongsheng, are sightseeing in Beiping and have not yet left. According to news from the North China Sports Federation, the location of the next swimming competition is planned to be held in Jinan, because Jinan still has swimming facilities. The talks of the heads of the Hebei, Shandong, and Qingdao teams leaving Beiping are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Zhao Wenzao Talks: Zhao Wenzao, the head of the Hebei Province team, told reporters that it was extremely fortunate that Hebei Province won the championship this time. Because the athletes of this unit were all selected from Tianjin, and Tianjin has no swimming facilities, the athletes lacked training opportunities. Most of the athletes practiced in wild reed pits such as Qinglongtan, so the long-distance results were better than the short-distance results. Zhao also said that the venue for the North China Games is being actively prepared and will definitely be completed before the opening of the conference.</p>
<p>▲ Shang Shumei Talks: Shang Shumei, the head of the Shandong team, told reporters that the athletes of this province have passed the technology at home. This time, they participated in the swimming competition with the intention of observing. Although Jinan has swimming facilities, they are too simple, and they are divided into days for training by the generals and business circles, so there are very few training opportunities and the results are naturally weak. Shang also said that the province is now preparing for the 18th North China Games and is scheduled to hold preliminary elections in mid-September. Male and female athletes are now in training, and it has been decided to select the best athletes to send to the conference.</p>
<p>▲ Zhao Huacheng Talks: Zhao Huacheng, the head of the Qingdao team, told reporters today (14th) that the reason why the Qingdao athletes won the championship this time is because (1) the youth along the coast of Qingdao often swim in the sea, so they have the opportunity to practice at ordinary times, (2) the number of female athletes participating this time is too small, and Qingdao has a larger number of female athletes, so it is easier to show results. It has been decided to participate in the North China Games. After returning to Qingdao, we will prepare for the selection.</p>
<h3>Two Swimming Teams from Beijing Come to Shanghai for Competition</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 16th Dispatch) The Yangtze River and Kowloon swimming teams from Beijing, led by Chen Ce and others, will go to Shanghai on the evening of the 17th to participate in the sea crossing competition. They will have a friendly match with the Shanghai China team on the 20th and a match with the Jiaotong University Youth Association on the 21st. It is planned to go to Gan for a long march after the competition in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Songjiang Long-Distance Running Results</h3>
<p>Reaching the 40-kilometer route in four hours. Gao Weilong led from start to finish and won the championship.</p>
<p>Due to the summer vacation, the youths in the Hunnan District of this city jointly initiated the organization of the Sea Star Track and Field Team a month ago, gathering people with lofty ideals to engage in various sports. They pay special attention to cross-country running. After the team members practiced hard every day, the results have gradually improved. The team captain, Qin Zhongliang, initiated the Shanghai-Songjiang long-distance cross-country race, which was unanimously approved by the team members. The trial period was selected on the 15th of this month. On the 14th, they obtained the consent of Bi, the director of the Sixth District and Second Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and immediately issued a certificate and a pass along the way. The team set off from the intersection of Xietu Road and Zhongshan Road at 4:00 am on the 15th in the dim morning light. At the sound of an order, the team members bravely moved forward, led by Xu Jinghua on a bicycle, and accompanied by Xue Peide (as a doctor), Mao Meisheng, Xu Dinggu, Tan Ahu, and Xu Fucai, who rode bicycles along the way to take care of and protect them. At each stop, the Public Security Bureau stamped a certificate. The team members were all eager to be the first, and their spirits were excellent. The team member Gao Weilong led the way all the way and was always the first person. He arrived at the finish line of Songjiang Station at 8:05:30, which took 4 hours and 5:30. The subsequent arrivals included Mao Xingsheng (second) at 4:08:00, Shen Hongru (third) at 4:22:00, Qin Zhongliang (fourth) at 4:44:00, Tan Qianxin (fifth) at 4:55:00, and Fan Fengchu (sixth) at 4:56:00. The route was 40 kilometers long, equivalent to about 100 Chinese miles. After reaching the finish line, the Songjiang First District Party Department and the County Public Security Bureau stamped certificates and welcomed them. The station military police also took care of and guarded them. The team rested at the station for an hour and then took a train back to Shanghai. The team was able to achieve such results with extremely short-term practice, which is really commendable.</p>
<h3>Practice of Shanghai West Road Walking Team on Weekends</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Road Walking Team recently held its fourth general meeting of all team members at Dao Yi Vocational Middle School to discuss matters related to participating in this year's Shanghai 13-mile open road walking competition and training.

<h3>Women and Decoration</h3>
<p>— Wei Ming</p>
<p>It is not surprising that gentlemen who care about the world and people suddenly intensify their attention to the major (prevention) matters of men and women in summer. The attire of women in summer is too provocative. The focus of (provocation) is that too much of the physical body is exposed. Therefore, the official document banning women from showing their legs and bare feet is a proud work that accurately grasps the topic.</p>
<p>When our ancestors lived a (savage) life in the mountains and forests, they had no means of covering their bodies. Everyone was used to seeing each other naked and didn't feel anything. However, this is precisely why savages are superficial. (Civilized people) have much more complex minds and pay attention to (implication) in everything, (with surplus but not exhausted). From this, (associations) are particularly developed. Seeing a small, exposed leg, one feels a little bit that way. In fact, legs are just legs. They are far less eloquent than eyebrows and less able to (send flirtatious glances) than eyes. Speaking of this, one cannot help but admire the method of Turkish women wearing veils on the streets in the past for being truly thorough.</p>
<p>As for applying oil and powder after exposing the legs, and painting the toenails red after baring the feet, changing from seeking convenience and coolness to wanting to be troublesome and look good—this is even more shocking. Naturally, these legs that are oiled, powdered, and painted are probably only a very small part of the exposed legs. Their purpose is completely different from that of ordinary exposed legs. Not only should such legs not be allowed to be (exposed), it might be better to throw them into the coal kiln thoroughly. What a pity is that these legs are mostly sitting in cars, and law-abiding police officers can only look at them.</p>
<p>Thinking from the opposite side, the leg owner is not afraid of trouble but applies oil and powder, simply because they want to look good. Making the legs look good is not for their own appreciation, but for the male society that seizes power and prohibits exposed legs and needs such attire and decoration. It is said that there used to be a female-centered society. At that time, did men deliberately dress up as lavishly as women do now? We are not very clear. However, Wu Jingzi gave us an answer in (Flowers in the Mirror). Even men in the Land of Women in (Flowers in the Mirror) would apply rouge and powder even if they had a big black beard. However, the gentlemen who care about the world and the people now refuse to close the book and think about it when they read this passage in (Flowers in the Mirror).</p>
<h3>Discussing the Issue of Europeanization from a Linguistic Perspective (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— He Fengyuan</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, is our debate about whether to Europeanize a waste of breath? Since linguistics has become a modern science, its first basic principle is that written language is living and changing. The reason why it lives and changes is because the social relations that determine it are living and changing; the people who speak and write it are also changing. It is a dream to keep Chinese characters permanently in the classical Chinese stage. It is also a dream to prevent Chinese characters from being influenced by foreign languages and being Europeanized, unless Chinese society is regressed and stopped there, unless China's sea, land, and air are sealed off and it never interacts with foreign countries.</p>
<p>A country's language accepts foreign characters and words, roughly under the following three circumstances:</p>
<p>(1) Nouns for foreign specialties or plants and animals discovered through foreign relations: In English, for example, "Lobster" comes from Latin, and "Morquito" mosquito comes from Spanish.</p>
<p>(2) Commodity nouns of foreign specialties: such as "Coco" cocoa and "Caffee" coffee, which are Mexican words.</p>
<p>(3) The expertise of a certain country in any aspect of academia or culture will lead to the import of its vocabulary in this area into other languages: For example, many musical terms in English are Italian words, such as "Archpelago"; many mathematical terms are Arabic words, such as "Slgebra"; many social terms are French, such as "Madame". There are countless foreign words borrowed in Chinese characters under these three circumstances, especially from Japanese.</p>
<p>Understanding these three circumstances, the borrowing of foreign words is actually inevitable. Since foreign characters and words have been borrowed, the grammar will inevitably become foreignized. For example, if a Japanese word is used in a sentence, the grammar will of course not be purely Chinese grammar. This is a very simple principle.</p>
<p>I don't understand why English, French, and Japanese all borrow foreign words (and also borrow our Chinese characters, for example, Tea in English is a Chinese word) and are all affected by foreignization, but we all say that Europeanization is a traitor. Are they also English traitors, French traitors, and Japanese traitors? This is entirely the inevitable result of cultural communication between countries in terms of language and writing. It is a betrayal to be ignorant of this principle and shout randomly!</p>
<p>On the other hand, before our writing was Europeanized, did it purely have only our own elements? I am afraid no one dares to say this! Chinese culture was influenced by Indian culture very early, especially the translation of Buddhist scriptures, which added countless Indian elements to us. There are many Sanskrit words in the current vocabulary, such as Nirvana and Stupa. And our vernacular literature, storytelling, ballad singing, and operas were determined by the translation of Buddhist scriptures in terms of origin and form. So, those who say that Europeanization is a traitor do not even know that their ancestors have already been traitors long ago!</p>
<p>Also, is our common language not Europeanized at all? May I ask: Where did the phrase "strike" come from? Workers on the Shanghai Bund are all talking about how many meters of wood, how many pounds of coal, and how many tons of ships! As for the foreign terminology used by technical workers, there are even more.</p>
<p>Brothers who consider themselves to be speaking up for the country and the nation and are against Europeanization, please touch your own butts and shut up! As for saying that we want to add a little Europeanization to Chinese grammar, it is not such a simple matter and will not be as simple as adding one or two points according to your heart's desire, so please refrain from speaking.</p>
<h3>Melon Seller</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>An old man in his fifties watches over a small melon stall.</p>
<p>This is a small alley, and the melon stall is set up under the eaves of a thatched house in the alley, which is also his residence. The thatched house is connected to the ridge and has more than ten rooms in total. Facing the thatched house is a row of tile-roofed houses connected to the ridge, with a square glass window installed on the roof of each room, probably skylights.</p>
<p>The road in the small alley under the eaves of the two houses is paved with gravel. Because it has not been repaired for many years, some of the stones are tilted, some have fallen off, and some have been picked up by children to fill the rat holes in the houses. It is simply impossible to find a complete and flat section on the road. People often fall down while walking.</p>
<p>Some neighbors call him "weird old man" because he is (alone). Others think he lives a very boring life, but he still lives the same way every day, getting up and resting on time, and doing his small business.</p>
<p>His customers are some children. He is very kind, and the children are willing to spend the few copper coins they cried and shouted to get from their mothers at his stall. Also, he cherishes the children very much, often stroking their dirty faces or playing with their soiled black hands. Therefore, the children are more willing to get close to him, this old man.</p>
<p>The melons he buys back are yellow melons, some large and some small. Then he goes to the well at the end of the alley to wash them; first, he washes the mud off the melon skin. He washes them so carefully, with such care, caution, and affection, very much like a father treating his son.</p>
<p>Every day, there are always some children surrounding his melon stall, adding a kind of liveliness to the alley. When the children quarrel, he will give away a melon to calm the dispute and comfort the crying children.</p>
<p>He goes to the market once every four or five days. The day before going to the market is when his melons are about to be sold out. At the same time, it can also be said that only a few bad melons are left. However, he can still sell them all. He reduces the price, and the children, greedy for cheapness, complete the transaction.</p>
<p>A small alley is not very big. People living in the alley see each other every day. Over time, everyone becomes familiar with each other. However, no one knows his inside story. His mouth is sealed like paint and has never told outsiders about his own life experience.</p>
<p>Some people think he is an old errand runner, a man who has never married a woman.</p>
<p>In fact, he is not only not an old errand runner, but also an old man with many children. He originally farmed in a village by the Yangtze River. In a certain year, a big flood scattered his family. Later, he was the only one left wandering to Shanghai. Houses in the city are expensive, and it is difficult to live without work. Therefore, he came up with this business. For several years, he has been engaged in the business of selling melons in the summer and candied haws in the winter.</p>
<p>When selling melons, he sits on a small bamboo stool, fanning himself with a banana leaf fan in his right hand. Because the fan is also used to fan the charcoal fire when cooking, it is stained with a lot of charcoal ash, dyeing it with patches of black stains.</p>
<p>Such an old man does business step by step every day. After a long time, others don't pay attention to it anymore. However, one day, no one knows why, he sat on the stool looking at the melon stall and suddenly cried well. Before crying, he stared blankly at the narrow sky above his head. He didn't know that the children were buying melons until they put the copper coins in his hand, then he blinked.</p>
<p>After crying for a while, he packed up the melon stall, closed the door of the thatched house, and lay down on the broken board bed. Some neighbors, out of curiosity, men, women, old and young, crowded to the window, intending to see what was going on.</p>
<p>He was crying, crying even more fiercely, snot and tears all running onto the bedding.</p>
<p>However, the next morning, he set up the melon stall on time again.</p>
<p>"What happened to you yesterday?"</p>
<p>"What are you crying about?"</p>
<p>"Do you have any painful things? Tell us, okay?"</p>
<p>Others asked him in front of the melon stall, but he didn't answer, just kept shaking his head. When people didn't press him too hard, he deliberately changed the subject and asked:</p>
<p>"Do you want to buy melons? The melons are good today."</p>
<p>He laughed himself.</p>
<h3>Watermelon</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Old Man (6)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>His young son's wife abandoned her one-and-a-half-year-old baby and married a blacksmith. This baby was Sasha. He raised him for twenty years, and he grew into a strong young man. He loved him very much, but also often scolded him. In business, Sasha was indeed a great help to him. Those things that an old man's energy couldn't do, the young man did for him like an ox. But Sasha sometimes had the temper of an ox. In his eyes, Sasha was often stubborn, and no matter how angry he got, he wouldn't listen to him. For example, if a woman happened to walk by on the street, Sasha would deliberately jump into the street, block her path, and perhaps say a few vulgar words. This was really hard for him to watch, and when Sasha came back, he would say in his rough voice:</p>
<p>(Sasha, you shouldn't do that!)</p>
<p>The young man ignored him, only rolled his eyes, and still like an ox, moved the old sewing machine to an empty space near the window. His lips were humming a vulgar tune.</p>
<p>(You really don't understand any decency, you should know to respect women. When I was young –)</p>
<p>Before he could finish, Sasha interrupted him:</p>
<p>(Respect women? Our generation is half a century apart from yours!)</p>
<p>Sasha scoffed mockingly.</p>
<p>(Even though the times are different, men are still men, and women are still women!)</p>
<p>He said angrily, almost pulling his beard, and stared at Sasha with his eyes wide open.</p>
<p>(Don't get so worked up), Sasha made a funny face, which immediately made the old man laugh, (These days, you really can't figure women out).</p>
<p>(Alright, I'm watching you,...)</p>
<p>After speaking, he walked away to continue the work he had stopped, and Sasha also began to sing a tune and do what he had to do.</p>
<p>Sasha was never tired of work, but the things around him often caused him unhappiness. They were all so old, almost every one of them had appeared in this world before him. Even though they had many good stories, they couldn't arouse his interest at all. They were all dull and lackluster; even trying to recall their past glory was so difficult, without any certainty. He often asked himself: (Am I really going to spend my whole life like this?) At this time, his heart would start to stir, and then he would think: (I'm going to leave sooner or later.)</p>
<p>Every time he thought about leaving this old environment, he thought of his old grandfather. He was already so old, usually annoying, but the thought of leaving evoked a deep sense of attachment. The old grandfather was really good in an annoying way. He took care of his grandson in the same way that his grandfather had taken care of him fifty or sixty years ago. He completely ignored the distance of several years in between. For this reason, the young man felt that he was nosy, nagging, troublesome, and unpleasant. Moreover, his grandfather had such a stubborn personality, (many people said it was because he hadn't had a woman for many years), that he didn't allow his rebuttals or arguments, so he often endured suffering for his grandfather's good intentions.</p>
<p>(What if I leave?)</p>
<p>He thought, and a flash of light seemed to appear in his heart; but when he thought about how his old grandfather would live if he left, he began to hesitate again. He knew that he was his only relative, and no one would take care of him or comfort his loneliness. But finally, he thought again: Am I really going to let myself rot away like these goods?</p>
<p>He left anyway, leaving a short note that made the old man grumble for days.</p>
<p>After this New Year, the old man began to think about his grandson earnestly. For two years, he had never said a word to anyone. Even now, if there were other people in front of him, he could probably still remain silent. But in reality, he missed him deeply. At least on days like this, if Sasha were still here, he would have closed the door early and finished everything that needed to be done, and he himself could have done nothing and comfortably gone to bed.</p>

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds are Massively Dumped</h3>
<p>▲Gold Shorts Plunge by More Than One Yuan. Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange suddenly experienced a slump in the market. The selling pressure was very strong, with most firms leaning towards selling. Retail investors were especially enthusiastic. Some longs left the market, and there were also many shorts who sold off. It was said that bandits in Fuzhou were rampant, and the situation was quite urgent. Although it was known that the facts did not match the rumors, in this time of weak morale, it was easy to take advantage of the situation. The market price in the exchange had been hovering and weakening for many days, and it actually caused a slump. However, if the rumors were unfounded, it would be easy to cause a reaction. Most of the sales in the market were from retail investors, and large investors bought in slightly. The future should cause a major change. Yesterday's opening was stable for the liquidation of troops, and the demobilization of troops was still weak and lifeless, losing the nest of hovering and weakening for many days. In the second round, rumors suddenly arose, and retail investors were quite panicked, and the selling was very strong. The slump gradually rose, becoming more and more intense. The larger ones suddenly dropped by about seven or eight dimes. The Fujian rebellion was only a local problem and had no major relationship with public bonds. I am afraid that it was just a case of busybodies disturbing themselves. In summary, the market price fell by two or three dimes to as much as one dollar and one dime compared to the previous day. The total number of transactions was 16.33 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are listed for comparison on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Mixed, Slightly Lower</h3>
<p>New Feng Yang Bank reported that yesterday (the 15th) the New York stock market was mixed and slightly lower due to the weakness of wheat in various markets around the world and the lack of inflationary stimulus. The bulls in the silver stocks, seeing that inflation was temporarily hopeless, continued to leave the market. Bankers were extremely supportive of the housing renovation plan, so construction stocks were particularly strong. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose first and then stagnated, and the result was still slightly higher than the previous day. The outlook for the steel industry in September was still good, but because the current workload was poor, copper and iron stocks were slightly soft. There was not much change in the stocks on the small exchange. Oil stocks rose, while food stocks were shaken by the Sturdivant crash. The bond market was led by US government bonds, and the appetite of banks and insurance companies was very strong. Commodity speculators paid no attention to various pro-bull news. The supply was abundant, while buyers were unusually indifferent. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 570,000. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Money Industry Maintain Long Positions</h3>
<h3>Yarn Market Rises Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had fallen for two consecutive days, rose again today, and the situation was slightly stable. The amount of yarn purchased by Qian Zhuang help has reached a huge 50,000 to 60,000 bales. According to rumors in the market, a meeting was once convened yesterday, and the result was that unless 10,000 bales were received this month, it would not be enough to maintain the market. As a result, the momentum in the business market suddenly tightened, but the short positions of Japanese merchants remained unchanged, so it is difficult to underestimate the near-term market. A major change is expected to occur in the future.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Returns to One Yuan</h3>
<p>Before the market opened for marked yarn, American cotton prices rose, and there were ten rumors circulating in the market, saying that a certain money house was helping the bulls. Seeing that the market had been falling recently, which was very unfavorable to them, they held a meeting yesterday to discuss and decided that unless they received 10,000 bales of marked yarn in August, they would not be able to raise the market. With this rumor, people who agreed with it actively purchased, and the prices of yarn for each month suddenly rose by 6.7 cents. This month became even tighter, and as a result, the prices for each month rose by 3.5.6.7.9 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were still maintainable, and there were many who were floating to make up for losses, so the prices for each month rose by 2.3.4.5 cents again. The total transaction volume for the day was 37,400 bales. It was found that Da Fu sold 600 bales, Da Ji 450 bales, Ming Hua 400 bales, Yuan Da 1,400 bales, Chang Yu 800 bales, Shen Ji 1,850 bales, Run Kang 450 bales, Ming De 450 bales, and Hui Kang 800 bales.

<h3>Yarn Sales Exceed 1,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that the total amount purchased by various gangs throughout the day was 1,245 bales. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of each gang are as follows: Sichuan 450, North Gang 30, Nanjing 5, Fujian 5, Wenzhou 65, Inland 65, Xiamen 10, Shantou 25, Guangdong 560, Xuzhou 10, Changsha 30, Fellow Traders 40.</p>
<h3>Shorts Take Profits and Cover Positions in Marked Cotton</h3>
<p>▲New Cotton Mills Order Over 6,000 Bales Daily</p>
<p>After several days of sharp decline in the cotton market, there was a slight rebound and rise. The rise in American cotton stabilized people's hearts, causing short sellers to take profits and cover their positions. At the same time, Jardine Matheson's British factory also actively purchased spot cotton, and the bulls' intentions were relatively firm. However, a large number of short sellers remained unmoved.</p>
<h3>Zheng Marked Up Two Cents</h3>
<p>Before the marked cotton market opened, the previous day's excessive decline caused profit-takers to cover their short positions, and American cotton prices also rebounded. The second and third sessions saw a stronger rise, but the closing price turned weak again. As a result, the prices for each month rose by 5 to 15 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that Jardine Matheson Factory purchased 3,000 pieces of Shaanxi cotton, and people's hearts were encouraged again. Short sellers covered their positions, and this month rose by 20 cents, while the farther months rose by 5 to 15 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 110,400 piculs. It was found that Ming Hua sold 1,300 piculs, Yuan Da 1,000 piculs, Da Feng 2,200 piculs, Jin Chang 1,300 piculs, Shen Chang 1,500 piculs, Yuan Da 4,900 piculs, Shen Ji 1,300 piculs, Chang Feng 2,600 piculs, Run Kang 2,600 piculs, Chong An 1,400 piculs, Yi Feng 1,400 piculs, Ren Feng 1,900 piculs.

<h3>Foreign Factories Have Strong Demand for Spot Goods</h3>
<p>The demand for spot cotton is slightly smoother, and British and Japanese factories are gradually showing interest. Chinese factories have little action. The spot cotton prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Marked Yarn Trading Volume Increases Daily</h3>
<p>▲Da Feng Sells the Most: 24,900 Bales ▲Hui Kang Buys the Most: 15,400 Bales</p>
<p>The inventory balance of marked yarn at the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange has increased compared to the previous time. This is due to the large-scale absorption of long positions by the Shanghai financial community and the large-scale short selling by Japanese merchants. Both sides have considerable opposing forces. As of August 15, the transaction volume for August futures was 38,600 bales, September futures 60,300 bales, October futures 69,200 bales, November futures 60,600 bales, December futures 46,600 bales, and January futures 38,050 bales, totaling 380,500 bales.

<h3>Overseas Cotton Markets Show Consistent Strength</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to selling by speculators, but later rebounded due to good cloth market conditions and short covering. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 points per pound, and futures prices rose by 13 to 17 points per pound. British cotton futures rose by 12 points. Indian cotton was strong due to buying by speculators. As a result, Pingguoer rose by 1.75 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.25 rupees, and Bairuoxi rose by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 15th):</p>

<h3>Flour and Wheat Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month showed a weak and stagnant state. The quotation for foreign wheat was about 35 cents for Chicago No. 3 and about 12 cents for Canadian small wheat. After the price revision, people's hearts immediately became unstable. In addition, the market situation was such that buyers had pushed prices to a peak and a considerable number of people had bought in. Now, the situation has reversed, and everyone is seeking to sell, while new buyers are also inactive due to unfavorable conditions. Although the North Gang had transactions, its remaining strength was limited. The quoted price for Tianjin spot flour also continued to fall, falling 8 cents the previous day and 10 cents yesterday. Therefore, the opening price for this month plummeted to 53 cents, down 7.5 cents from the previous day, and the forward price also fell by 4 to 5 cents. In the second session, floating positions were covered, and there was a slight rebound. However, when the afternoon market opened, it was still weak at first. After the second session, the buying sentiment gradually became active due to slight transactions in the Tianjin Gang, and the market rebounded by about 2 to 3 cents from the lowest point. However, by the third session, the market showed a soft trend again due to slight selling by factories. According to the current situation, after a big rise, it is followed by a big fall. From now on, the market conditions should be able to enter a normal track. If factory flour is accumulated and customer demand cannot continue, the future may need to be leveled again. As a result, this month fell by 3.5 cents, November fell by 3 cents, December fell by 1.75 cents, and January fell by 2.5 cents.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened, the market for each month also showed a plummeting trend. The quoted price for foreign wheat also fell by 12 cents to 35 cents. Therefore, after the price revision, the market situation appeared very bleak. This month was particularly sluggish due to the abundance of spot wheat. According to rumors in the industry, the amount of wheat arriving in this port and deposited in warehouses has reached a huge amount of about 500,000 bags. The factories are also very well stocked and lack interest in purchasing. Therefore, the previous week's frantic rise that was not deserted but noisy has gradually become apparent, and the market has also returned to peace in response to this imbalance in supply and demand. The lowest price for this month was as low as 74 cents, down 13 cents from the previous day. The prices for September and beyond fell by about 10 cents. When the afternoon market opened, it was still flat and weak at first. After the second session, the market rebounded by 3 to 5 cents due to the slightly better flour market and stronger buying sentiment. However, the overall trend has been broken, and the spot wheat inventory is very thick, so it is feared that there will be little hope for a good future for the time being. As a result, this month fell by 10 cents from the previous day, September fell by 6 cents, October fell by 4 cents, November fell by 6 cents, December fell by 3 cents, and January fell by 5 cents. The four small factories for spot wheat are fully allocated, and the large factories are not moving, so they are holding back and not opening.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ke Xian Rice Arrives Continuously</h3>
<p>▲Morning Rise and Afternoon Fall Within and Outside One Cent</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign Ke Xian rice saw a continuous increase in inland sales over the past few days, and people's hearts were hopeful. Yesterday morning, both inland and local merchants were active. After the market opened, foreign Ke Xian rice generally continued to rise by one cent. High-quality Xiaojiao rice was once reduced in price to ten yuan and four cents. However, domestic and foreign sources have been continuously arriving recently. The previously scheduled Saigon rice has arrived in batches, and the Annam Chung rice transferred from Hong Kong has also been arriving in Shanghai continuously. Hunan, Shashi, Taizhou, Jiangbei, and Anhui have also continuously reported arrivals. Moreover, the various Ke Xian rice purchased from Fujian some time ago has not yet been cleared, and now the province's own production is on the market, with prices lower than those in Shanghai. Therefore, the various Xiang and Anhui Ke Xian rice that was shipped some time ago has been returned to Shanghai for sale. Although there are losses such as formal tariffs and additional expenses, it is still possible to make a profit. After the price of rice rose again yesterday morning, the appetite of local merchants weakened once the rice from various places arrived. The selling price of each rice uniformly returned slightly, and Xiaojiao rice dropped again from ten yuan and three cents to ten yuan and two and a half cents. Lower-quality rice was reduced to ten yuan, which is close to the market price of the previous day. Although the newly arrived Saigon rice is new, it has not been sold on the market and is only sold for eleven yuan, two and a half cents to two and three cents. Other rice prices generally rose first and then flattened, and the increase compared to the previous market was minimal. The total volume of rice opened throughout the day was about 5,000 bags, with foreign Ke Xian rice accounting for half of them. It is said that most of the rice is still going to inland areas.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Zhoupu New Japonica Rice Sold Out</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were on the 16th and 17th (goods totaling 2,700 to 2,800 stones), and the market conditions softened, with sluggish sales. Therefore, various thick japonica rice and late rice fell by 10 to 20 cents. Dong rice fell due to the launch of new rice and the arrival of foreign rice. Du Yangjian also fell as a result, with a price decrease of more than one inch. Only the cloudy rice had little fluctuation. The first batch of Zhoupu new japonica rice has gradually sold out due to the launch of new rice. The next batch will not be available until half a month later, so the price is still set at eleven yuan and two cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 14 to 15 rice boats from various gangs in Hexia. The market for each good was flat, but Ke Jian had slight transactions. White japonica early thin rice prices were down by about 10 cents, and Baiyuan was steady. Yang Dujian had a small number of points, and Ke Jian was slightly tighter. The arrival of Dongxin japonica rice was slightly sparse, and the price was still stable.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Chinese Silk American Sales Still Difficult to Progress</h3>
<p>Recently, the US government implemented a silver policy to suppress gold dollars, leading to renewed talk of currency inflation. The prices of New York futures and spot silk have both turned strong, but when the exchange rate is combined with the Chinese currency B-grade factory offer, it is still more than 100 yuan different from the cost of each factory. Therefore, American sales are still difficult to progress. Yesterday, only Choumeng entered 40 packages of White Factory silk, and the price was still flat.</p>
<h3>Fine Eyebrow Green Tea Sales Stagnant and Prices Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port for foreign firms, the sales of Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas were still sluggish. Chinese merchants, seeing the unfavorable situation, continued to lower prices and compete for sales, and the market price fell by another four or five yuan from before. The British firm Jinlong Foreign Company still purchased a huge amount of green tea from the Wuyuan North Road gang, and the wholesale price remained unchanged from before. However, the sales of Pingshui Dabang green tea are still stagnating. The market for local Zhenmei Pearl tea is also deserted, and the situation for green tea is still feared to have more declines than rises.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>On the Relationship Between Father and Son</h3>
<p>— Shi Shi</p>
<p>The kindness of parents cannot be analyzed; children should fulfill their filial duties, which is an absolute obligation. Although parents have differences in strictness and kindness, this cannot affect the increase or decrease in filial piety. This ethical concept has long been considered an irrefutable argument in our country's traditional patriarchal social system. However, in the current era, all old beliefs are undergoing fundamental changes; any issue can become an object of suspicion; people also want to re-evaluate the kindness of parents. According to the arguments of most modern great thinkers and philosophers, it is generally recognized that (motherly love) is the highest human nature; and general writers and poets more often use motherly love as a theme to praise the nobility and beauty of motherhood. Therefore, modern people's concept of (mother) is to replace the old saying of (boundless deep kindness) with (great true love). However, they all (dismissively disregard) paternal kindness and love; presumably, they feel that a stern and serious father is inherently more distant than a kind mother; and in reality, the emotions between father and son are indeed not as close and affectionate as those between mother and son. Therefore, modern people's new ethical concept still recognizes that there is an inseparable and genuine affection between mother and son; while the relationship between father and son is considered to be built on the harmony of emotions between both parties. The so-called (benevolent father and filial son) is purely a relative saying, which is different from the previous absolute monism of serving parents with only (filial piety). I remember not long ago, there was a (Virtuous Father and Filial Son) film that was converted from a silent film to a sound film, which fully expressed the connection between the emotions of father and son, and a kind of (equal love). The main point of this film is very sufficient to illustrate the modern people's ethical view of father and son: that is, the father should have the gift of love, and the children should respond with filial piety; conversely, if the father does not have kindness and love for the children (for example, a profligate father who does not care about support, and illegitimate children who are abandoned at a young age), then even if there is a nominal relationship, the children's obligation to be filial is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Based on this point of view, we can say that the emotions between father and son are purely mutually constructed. In other words, it is half due to paternal benevolence and half due to filial piety, and the two should have equal quality in order to be comprehensively integrated into a complete harmony. However, human emotions are constantly changing, and both parties cannot maintain eternal balance; in the relationship between father and son, as long as the emotions of one party slightly weaken, it will cause defects in the entire relationship and cause unspoken dissatisfaction between each other's hearts. Although this latent (dissatisfaction) can be compensated for by (tolerance) (for example, our country has traditionally used a hundred tolerances as a family motto), when the internal dissatisfaction exceeds the degree of tolerance, it will inevitably be expressed in behavior, and then both parties will unconsciously grow apart, and even unconsciously start conflicts.</p>
<p>Especially in terms of ideological issues: In this turbulent era, everything new and old is sharply advancing in an extremely contradictory manner; human thoughts are changing rapidly along with the rapid changes of the times; the formation of ideological differences between father and son due to age is almost inevitable. I remember Inoue Ichiichiro once said: (A father and his son are ultimately separated by twenty years!) This statement is even more appropriate in modern China. Because in the real world, even if father and son are moving forward towards the same standard, the father can never catch up with the son. And when the father stands on his own position and looks at his son, he often finds many shortcomings; conversely, when the son looks at his father from his own position, there are also many shortcomings. This ideological disharmony, reflected in behavior, will constitute various disputes: all problems of survival, problems of dealing with the world, as well as social interaction, marriage, etiquette, customs, and other problems, will cause father and son to generate head-on conflicts; thus, modern families are gradually shaken in our country's society.</p>
<p>The instability of the family will directly affect the instability of society; in order to maintain social order, we should actively find ways to eliminate this ideological dispute between father and son. According to Inoue Ichiichiro's opinion, the most effective way to eliminate it is to strictly advocate early marriage. He analyzes the instability of modern young people's thoughts, considering sexual insufficiency as a major factor; once they have wives and children, they will immediately become stable and mature; and all kinds of gaps between father and son can be eliminated invisibly by early marriage. Inoue's proposition has a deep academic basis, and it cannot be compared with the superficial views of those who advocate (the harm of early marriage). However, this method is inevitably more dependent on the father's side, and it seems that it cannot be appropriately suitable in practice. (Of course, in theory, it is worthy of special attention, and the author intends to discuss it in a separate article when there is an opportunity.) In order to take care of both parties fairly, I think that there is no other good solution except (accommodation) from both parties.</p>
<p>But who should accommodate whom? This is very difficult to say. On the father's side: it is believed that the most important thing in life is practical experience, and experience can only increase with age; young people's blood is not settled, and it is difficult for reason to control emotions, and it must be guided to the right path by stable people, so as not to enter the wrong path. On the son's side: it is felt that modern society is advancing with the rapid progress of the times, and in the transition between the old and the new, a slight hesitation will cause one to fall behind; older people's thinking will inevitably accept some old influences, and have preconceived ideas, just like small bound feet, which cannot be enlarged to become natural feet. Young people have less experience in the world and will not suffer from any external deterioration or corruption, so they can easily grasp the accurate consciousness of the times in terms of thought. Both of these arguments have considerable reasons. But let us try to measure it with an objective eye: What should we adopt and what should we abandon? Or what method can be used to make these two extreme views agree with each other? This is a very interesting and noteworthy question. Here, the author's personal conclusion is tentatively postponed, and I hope that intelligent readers can give it an appropriate judgment.</p>
<h3>The Children of Foreign Lands</h3>
<p>— Yong Bo</p>
<p>Surrounded by Japanese style, Japanese flavor, and naturally, even more Japanese people.</p>
<p>It seems that Avenue Joffre is a French area, Nanjing West Road is a British area - this place is a Japanese area.</p>
<p>Moreover, the French and British areas are not pure. For example, Avenue Joffre has many Russians, Portuguese, and Spanish mixed in; Nanjing West Road also has many Americans, Germans, and Italians living there. But the Japanese area only has Japanese people living there, and even Koreans rarely live together - except for our pitiful owner! Chinese people!</p>
<p>I have lived in the Japanese area for more than half a year now. But I have no interest in their men, who seem humble but are arrogant, and the same goes for the fierce old women and charming young women. What I am most interested in are the children who are always jumping and making noise in the alleys. I watch them closely, studying their every move, as well as their physiques, intelligence, and the like, to see if they will be like their fathers and brothers in the future? To see if they will be able to change a little of their fierce nature when they treat people in the future?</p>
<p>The results of my observation have left me both satisfied and apprehensive. What I have discovered exceeds my expectations by a great deal. First, they all sing a kind of military song in the morning and evening, which shows the influence they receive unconsciously in regard to the spirit of martial arts. Second, their attitude towards Chinese people is very bad. If you are walking and they bump into you while running wildly, they will scold you instead and make fierce gestures towards you, which shows that they have developed a psychology of despising Chinese people from a young age. Third, their methods of revenge are also superior to others. Once, because Japanese children threw mud at our back building, the landlord went to tell their parents, and they were beaten as a result; but the child actually held a grudge and, taking advantage of the opportunity, mixed asphalt with the soil and filled the gaps in the keyhole of the back door. As a result, when the key was forced into the hole and turned, it broke - and the same thing happened when a second person was not careful. This forced the landlord to dismantle it for repairs, and as a result, two screws were dropped, which he complained about endlessly!</p>
<p>They knew that asphalt had great stickiness and that mud was very effective in blocking things, so they used them to complete the act of revenge. Although I also dislike their noise, I admire their rich scientific knowledge. In this kind of place, our Chinese children cannot help but be humbled in comparison.</p>
<p>It is summer vacation recently, and those boys and girls like to play a kind of game similar to [unclear] in the alley. "Yang Jin - Beng! Yang Jin - Beng!" They shout in unison and wave their hands. I am not familiar with Japanese, so I don't know what they are up to, but judging from their attitude, it seems to be a kind of excited or encouraging shout. At the same time, in addition to the group shouting, there are also two people running in the alley. This also shows that even Japanese children's free games have a bit of formalization.</p>
<p>They all have monks' heads, their legs are especially strong, and we have nothing to criticize about their lively spirit, strong physique, and simple style. The main thing is whether our Chinese children can also become lively, strong, and simple immediately due to the improvement of education, so that they can resist their aggressive descendants in the future - and then become lively, strong, and simple, and then resist their aggressive descendants in the future - to solve our future great problems!</p>
<p>(Ten years of accumulation, ten years of education.) Our weak country has not put in that kind of effort, and on the contrary, Japan, a strong country, has already put it in! Thinking of this, how can we not sigh?</p>
<h3>Things Everyone Knows</h3>
<p>— Wind</p>
<p>His shadow was trampled underfoot, it was almost noon. He hurriedly brushed past shoulders, heading home, two silk quilts completely soaked with sweat; sweat from his forehead flowed down his cheeks to the corners of his mouth. Although a dark yellow silk handkerchief was tightly held in his palm, his mind was preoccupied with his wife's gloomy face, and he had no time to wipe away the sweat that was about to drip into his beard.</p>
<p>One road after another, he turned into a side alley by the large Western-style house with red walls. From afar, he saw his wife looking this way, and he quickened his pace. His wife slowly came to meet him. In front of the second house, they stood facing each other. His wife grabbed his arm and shook it repeatedly, asking: "Successful?" He nodded, and waved the tightly held dark yellow silk handkerchief, and his wife smiled and told him that the frequent visitor, Mr. Wang, had been waiting at home for several hours. He hurriedly pulled out a five-yuan banknote from the handkerchief and handed it to his wife, "Hurry and buy rice, and bring back some side dishes." After saying that, he ran into the bamboo gate.</p>
<p>In the living room, his old friend was pacing back and forth with his head lowered as if he were mad, or as if he were staring at a small object on the ground. He didn't even hear him enter. It took him calling his name for him to belatedly say, "Ha - um" for a long time.</p>
<p>"Sorry to keep you waiting, when did you arrive?"</p>
<p>The host took off his long gown, took out a cigarette case from the pocket of his short gown, offered a cigarette to his guest, and asked him to sit down.</p>
<p>"Just arrived - a while ago." The guest said and then corrected himself.</p>
<p>"Still no news from that side?"</p>
<p>"There are many people looking for him, what can be done!"</p>
<p>The guest smoked his cigarette angrily.</p>
<p>The living room was silent, and the buzzing of flies could be heard.</p>
<p>His wife's shadow was peeking out from behind the door. When he walked over, she asked in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Will Mr. Wang eat?"</p>
<p>"Of course, he'll eat at this time!"</p>
<p>He answered loudly, startling the guest from his reverie. He immediately stood up and quickly replied:</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law, don't be polite, I'm leaving."</p>
<p>"Is there nothing else? Have a meal here before you go."</p>
<p>"There's a small matter." He said haltingly.</p>
<p>"Have a meal before you go."</p>
<p>The guest took a few small steps as if deep in thought, "I'll go home, I'll come again another day." Then he walked towards the back door.</p>
<p>He chased after him and was already outside the door. The guest turned back, wanting to reply, but only said, "I'm leaving."</p>
<p>The host nodded, ran back home, grabbed the dark yellow silk handkerchief bundle from the table, chased after the guest by the large Western-style house with red walls, and stuffed another five-yuan banknote into his hand.</p>
<p>"Take it and use it first. I'll come to see you in a few days."</p>
<p>"I - no -"</p>
<p>The two pairs of hands pushed and shoved for a while, and the guest said gratefully, "I'll return it to you another day, I'm leaving."</p>
<p>"Goodbye." He watched the thin, long shadow disappear and turn into the side alley. His wife was waiting for him at the back door.</p>

<h3>Sickness</h3>
<p>— Yao</p>
<p>Our country has been considered a sick man by people of other countries, and in the past, it had the nickname of "Sick Man of East Asia." Don't be angry, this is not deliberately insulting ourselves. We should first ask ourselves, indeed, our people do not pay much attention to their health, they ignore the structure of the human body, and they are indifferent to the invasion of external bacteria... This rather one-sided view, although it existed at one time, if we examine it in detail, there are other relationships that are established and exist, and it is not as simple as it seems. We are a colonial country, precisely because we are a secondary colonial country – an area for the imperialists to sell their surplus goods – and everything is indirectly controlled by the imperialist capitalists. Therefore, the health of most of our people has been deprived due to imperialism. Of course, there are other reasons that we won’t discuss. We cannot deny the facts before us.</p>
<p>Sickness is the most pitiful and sad thing. No matter who sees a sick person, even a person with a heart of stone will feel pity and express sympathy. It goes without saying that someone rich in emotion would feel even more so. In the life process of "birth, aging, sickness, and death," death only happens once, and there's nothing to be afraid of. Aging begins to be tasted in the late years of life and does not last very long. As long as the center point of one's life exists, and one believes that life has meaning, then one can gain interest in life, and aging is not necessarily bitter. Sickness is the real problem. It can visit us at any time. From birth to death, no one can avoid getting sick. The chances of getting sick are greatest in childhood and old age. In adulthood, it is relatively less. Sickness is a painful thing, not only because it affects the entire body or a part of it, but also because it affects one's personal finances. If you get sick, of course, you must ask a doctor to examine you, otherwise, a disease in one part may spread to the entire body and cause unexpected events. Therefore, one must ask a doctor to visit when one is sick. In today's society, one can hardly afford to call a doctor. One visit will cost at least a yuan, plus the cost of medicine, which adds up to several yuan. Even in the working-class factory area, calling the most basic doctor costs at least forty cents, plus the cost of medicine. At the very least, each visit will cost a yuan. And one visit is not guaranteed to cure the illness. Doctors are not living immortals, so isn't seeing a doctor multiple times a problem? Several yuan will be wasted. Of course, it is not a problem for the bourgeoisie. It is common for them to spend hundreds or even thousands of yuan on their children's illnesses, but it is a problem for the working class, farmers, servants, and small citizens. The value earned by labor is barely enough to maintain daily life, so where is there any surplus to pay for medical expenses? Poverty and illness are common in today's society. If you run into the slums of the lower classes and take a look, you can get even more facts. On the other hand, the waste of the wealthy class is increasing day by day. This shows the contradictions in today's society and exposes its shortcomings.</p>
<h3>Flowers on the Desk</h3>
<p>— Qian Xu</p>
<p>I ran to my friend Xu's house, and Xu was sitting there quietly reading a book. Actually, this couldn't be considered a home. There was only Lao Xu himself. He had his own home in the countryside, where his father, mother, brothers, and sisters lived. This was just a place for him to sleep and rest after work.</p>
<p>"Lao Xu, how carefree!"</p>
<p>Lao Xu quickly stood up and shook my hand. Our friendship didn't require any polite greetings. Originally, these "old tunes" had long been eliminated in the minds of young people. I often came to this place, and I was very familiar with everything, such as the bed, chairs, and table. I could understand everything at a glance. Today, I exceptionally discovered a vase of flowers on the right corner of the desk, quietly emitting its fragrance.</p>
<p>"Lao Xu, how elegant!" I said to him, pointing at the vase of flowers.</p>
<p>"Hum! Bored!"</p>
<p>"I like your 'bored' behavior very much."</p>
<p>Since that time, I felt that it was indeed necessary to put a vase of flowers on the desk. And I heard from Lao Xu that buying a bouquet of flowers from a flower vendor only cost sixteen to twenty copper coins, which I thought wouldn't have an impact on my finances. What's more interesting is that a friend who had just come from Suzhou a few days ago gave me a bottle of "Pine Nut Candy." I had almost finished eating it, so I ate the few remaining candies, and the hexagonal long-necked bottle was cleaned and could be used as a vase. So, from that day on, my desk also had a vase of flowers emitting its quiet fragrance.</p>
<p>I never ask for the names of the flowers I buy. As long as I think they are lovely, I buy them and display them on the desk. Every morning, after changing the water, I always leaned toward it and gazed at it for a few minutes. If its posture was not good, I would correct it by hand. Although my apartment wasn't like Lao Xu's, where people often came, I always did this.</p>
<p>The first flowers I bought were five-colored, and the colors were very bright. The petals looked a bit like flying butterflies, intermingling with the green leaves. In addition, the stems were straight, which could increase people's aesthetic sense. But in less than four days, the roots rotted, and I could only throw them into the trash. The second time, I bought what was said to be fragrant flowers. They were inserted in the vase gracefully and constantly broadcasted their rich fragrance, but after five days, they also rotted and stank.</p>
<p>So I stopped buying flowers. My reason for not buying flowers was not because of economic reasons, not because I was afraid of the trouble of the procedure, nor because they couldn't last, but because I really felt the difficulty in disposing of them after they lost their inherent life. Because every time I buried their remains in the trash, I always felt unbearable, with an unspeakable hidden pain in my heart.</p>
<p>I have realized that there is no difference between flowers and people. Not only can they not be regarded as playthings at will, but even slight restraints – such as planting flowers in pots – also hinder their vitality.</p>
<p>Now there are no flowers on my desk, and even the vase for the flowers has been hidden away. But I don't know what Lao Xu is doing.</p>
<h3>Chinese Dumb Show</h3>
<p>— Bing Yuan</p>
<p>(Dumb Show) is a foreign thing. In Chinese drama, especially on the old-fashioned stage, you can say that you can't find a drama that can be completely called (Dumb Show). Although there are several dramas, only (expression), (body), (steps) are used to represent language, as exemplified by (Jiang Gan Stealing the Book) in (The Gathering of Heroes), but that is only a part, and it still cannot be called a complete (Dumb Show). Only the dramas in the (Playing with Lanterns) season are absolutely non-vocal. It seems that it can be classified as a dumb show in the Chinese art section! Moreover, it does have a natural special style. Originally, the intention of such an organization is in (Lanterns) and (Playing), not in (Singing) and (Speaking). The focus of the performance is also on (hands, waist, legs, and feet), not on (mouth). What's more, not everyone who plays with lanterns can sing and speak? As a result, Chinese dumb shows have had historical success and a special style in the Lantern Festival groups, which is very worthy of our recollection and appreciation.</p>
<p>Performing dramas in the Lantern Festival society certainly had a great influence in the past. Because it is not only about art, but also symbolizes the customs of various places. As far as I know, its types can be roughly divided into three major parts: one is walking; one is stilt walking; and one is carrying the pavilion. Walking, of course, means playing the characters in the drama and walking on the ground. Stilt walking uses wooden sticks tied to the legs, sometimes particularly high, almost level with the eaves, at least it must (stand out from the crowd), just like stepping on the stage. In short, no matter how far or near, the audience's line of sight must be reached without any obstacles. The raised pavilion is made of two long sedan chair poles, carrying a flat wooden thing similar to a half table, which is called the pavilion. The pavilion is decorated with the scenery needed in the plot, which is not simple. In addition, extremely thin iron pillars are erected, and the performers are tied to the pillars, either sitting or standing, and also acting according to the most tense scene in the plot. However, the audience should not see the iron pillars, only the characters in the air, then it is considered wonderful. This is just a stage. As for the number of people carrying it, it depends on the number of performers, the complexity of the plot, and the lightness of the mass.</p>
<p>Among this kind of Lantern Festival drama, the raised pavilion is naturally the most important. Their programs are also the same as the Peking Opera often performed on the stage. However, only the protagonists have a share. Whether the supporting actors can go on the pavilion is still a question. Or, in the case of not being able to cut down the personnel, sometimes there are also one or two supporting actors who stand high on the pavilion out of thin air, looking around and feeling proud! As for the (extras), that is undoubtedly, there is never this luck.</p>
<p>Whether walking, stilt walking, or carrying the pavilion, in the Lantern Festival drama, their arrangement all has a stage perspective. Therefore, when a dozen or so dramas pass through the streets in a row, we will always see (male, female, painted face, clown) all complete, both civil and military dramas. How interesting is this? I think the modern (open-air stage) and (mobile drama) are not imitating the (Lantern Festival drama)? It is a pity that most of the organizers of this group are characters from another society, and absolutely one or two playwrights or artists cannot be found among them, so their organization is not sound.</p>
<p>Novel</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver Gully (2)</h3>
<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>It was noon when a burst of commotion suddenly erupted in Wang Siye's main room, followed by a clatter, as if something was banging against each other. The people on the gully were just on their way home for lunch. Those passing by their front door, filled with curiosity, surged to the door of the main room, and everyone focused their eyes on the square table in the middle of the main room, up and down. They suddenly understood something and dispersed.</p>
<p>"Fuck your mother, are you treating me like a beggar who eats vegetarian meals!" A thin, tall man in his thirties, wearing a military uniform and sitting in the upper seat, pushed away the loofah and tofu soup bowl on the table. With a bang, the bowl mouth hit the dining table, and the bowls and plates on the table were either knocked over on the ground or tilted over on the tabletop. The green loofah soup flowed down the table like a faucet that wasn't tightly closed, dripping onto the long wooden bench and falling on the ground.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, squad leader, today because... because the temple is holding a religious ceremony, meat is forbidden... so... so I couldn't buy meat dishes... Squad leader, please be lenient..." Wang Siye stood up from the side seat, bending over. He moved the bowls and plates that had been overturned by the shock, trembling as he explained and pleaded.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, Xiuying was so frightened that she hid by the door, peeking at the situation in the main room. In the silence, only her mother's dry cough could be heard from the bed.</p>
<p>The squad leader in the upper seat stood up angrily, his eyes red and about to spit fire. He grabbed the corner of the long bench he was sitting on and threw it backward with force. With a bang, the bench lay on its back with its four legs pointing towards the sky, lying on the base corner on the left side of the main room. Then, he stepped back to the long bench leaning against the wall on the right side, tore open his legs, stomped one foot on the ground, and stepped one foot on the bench, looking down intently at the ground in front of him, as if he wanted to discover something there.</p>
<p>Zhou Jiazhang, who was sitting in the lower seat, and the soldier who came with the squad leader, left the seat together. Zhou Jiazhang circled around the main room. Xiuying saw his shadow and quickly shrank back. The head of the village squeezed his eyes at Wang Siye solemnly, hinting that he should not speak, and that he had a way. He walked to the squad leader, bent over, and said apologetically:</p>
<p>"Um, I'm really sorry, squad leader. I'll treat you to wine tomorrow... This, this is on me..."</p>
<p>After speaking, he glanced at Wang Siye, who was squatting on the doorstep in a daze, and then put his mouth close to the squad leader's ear and said something in a low voice. The squad leader nodded without saying a word. The village head walked to the gate, patted Wang Siye on the shoulder, and Wang Siye followed him out.</p>
<p>In the main room, in the extra silence, only the cough in the inner room intensified.</p>

<h3>Jean Harlow's Powerful Rival, a Newcomer in Hollywood Musicals</h3>
<p>— Suyin</p>
<p>Does platinum blonde Jean Harlow have a rival? Maybe not before, but now she does! Hollywood has now discovered a new blonde, and her shooting speed is almost the same as Jean's was before, and she is still rising. This new discovery is Alice Faye. She is still a newcomer in Hollywood, but after appearing in a few scenes in the film (Scandals), she has already alarmed the seasoned Hollywood reporters, and everyone is starting to pay attention and investigate her. They say her performance is very similar to Jean Harlow's, and she may replace Harlow in the future.</p>
<p>Alice's hair is not platinum blonde, but bright gold. That's certainly not bad-looking, especially since her hair naturally has many small curls? As for her face, she is extremely beautiful, no wonder people say that Jean Harlow can't sleep at night when she sees her. When she is cold, it seems that White Tower Oil placed in her mouth will not melt; but when she is happy... gee... those eyes, I really don't know how many people have lost their souls for her! Green and oily, like a pool of autumn water, filled with an incredible thing, probably what people generally call (sex appeal). Some people compare Alice and Jean Harlow and say that she is very similar to Jean, but because she is younger, she may be even more beautiful than Jean. But Alice herself said that she dared not compare herself with Jean Harlow. She said: "People say I look like Jean Harlow, and the company also says that, but I can't see it. I have met Jean Harlow, she is so gentle and beautiful, I really can't reach her. Look, her nose is straight, but the tip of my nose is a little upturned." Someone said, "Aren't the other parts almost the same?" Alice said: "There are also cheekbones, mine are higher than Harlow's." From this, it can be seen how much this Alice Faye pays attention to everything on Jean Harlow's face.</p>
<p>Alice Faye is indeed a Broadway daughter. She was born and raised in New York. She was first noticed for dancing, not for singing. She dances in nightclubs all over New York and never sings. But she doesn't have a desire to sing, but she is a little timid because she hasn't met a famous teacher to train her. Later, she met a lawyer for a famous singer, Roth Van Leary. He knew that Alice had a rich voice, and he asked her to spend twenty-five cents to record a piece of her own singing. The lawyer took the record and played it for Roth Van Leary. Van Leary liked it very much when he heard it. This twenty-five-cent record was the pivot of Alice Faye's luck. Roth Van Leary immediately called her and signed a contract with her to sing exclusively on the radio. Later, she was recruited to Hollywood. She is now a singer and dancer at the Fox company.</p>
<p>When she left Broadway and went to Hollywood, she said: "I admire New York the most. I don't want to leave it. But if I can succeed in movies, that is of course what any woman dreams of day and night. I like to perform. I used to be a nightclub dancer, and now the parts I am assigned are all roles of singers and dancers, which are very suitable for me. As for reciting lines, I had never tried it before shooting the first film. This is of course where I can't reach Jean Harlow... Didn't she know how to recite lines from the beginning?" She said, her eyes making the look of Alice in Wonderland. Those eyes of hers, I don't know how much help they will give her!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of (Frisco Jenny)</h3>
<p>— Xun Zhi</p>
<p>Frisco Jenny – Shown in Nanjing –</p>
<p>The tragedy of (Mother and Son), with the conflict between human sentiment and law as its theme, we have seen a lot in past movies, so this (Frisco Jenny) can be said to be very clichéd in terms of subject matter. As usual, when American films deal with such themes, on the one hand, in order to maintain the dignity of the law, the law must be written as fair and impartial to cover up the social basis of this superstructure. On the other hand, in order to cater to the sentimental atmosphere of the citizens, coincidences, misunderstandings, and even unnecessary self-sacrifices must be used to emphasize the greatness of so-called (maternal love). (The House of 56), directed by Robert Florey and starring Key Francis, which was shown in Shanghai before, is also this type of work.</p>
<p>For the sake of her son's (future), the mother committed the capital crime of murder, but it happened that the person handling and arguing the case was the offender's son, who was serving as a local prosecutor. The prosecutor did not know that she was his mother, so based on her past behavior, he demanded the maximum penalty of death. The mother, on the other hand, accepted the judgment of being sentenced to death for the sake of her only son's (social status). (Frisco Jenny)</p>
<p>There are no other special features in the story, but it cannot be said that it is a characteristic of Wellman's intellect to end with a tragedy instead of conforming to the stereotype of all American films (happy ending).</p>
<p>Such a clichéd theme and such a chronological and lengthy story, but this still constitutes a technically very ordinary work. This achievement is partly due to the screenplay by Wilson Mizner and Robert Lord, and partly due to the direction of William A. Wellman. The depiction of the atmosphere of the lower-class bar before the San Francisco earthquake, the extremely simple, economical and natural introduction of the characters on the stage, the description of the heroine's personality changes, and even the omission method of the process between the middle ten years (this can also be said to be an adaptation of Capra's method in (Forbidden)), all proved Wellman's solid technique and his transcendent ability to narrate. In order to make a chronological film composed of a series of broadcasts not become an accumulation of broadcasts, but to be able to closely grasp the key points of each broadcast, this is not an easy task in screenwriting and directing.</p>
<p>Among the very few pure film directors, there are several similarities between Wellman and his predecessor King Vidor and his younger generation Stephen Roberts. Vidor's simplicity and tranquility, Roberts' straightforwardness and sincerity, Wellman's keenness and ability to grasp the ordinary people cannot feel the sense of fusion in an instant, and a kind of empathetic moist tone that they share. In the rampant commercialism and American directors who use eroticism as their lifeline, these existences also seem to be worth cherishing.</p>
<p>This is a work produced in 1932. In terms of age, this is far before several successful works of Wellman. If you look at this as a stage in Wellman's progress, this is still a work worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Review (The Battle of Verdun)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Verdun – A Cathay Film</p>
<p>A French film produced to promote imperialist war.</p>
<p>The arms race between imperialist powers has become a very obvious fact. The recent death of Dollfuss has highlighted the contradictions and conflicts between European countries, telling us that the outbreak of war is possible at any time. In particular, the recklessness of German fascists has shattered the dreams of the Versailles system. The so-called European hegemony that France gained from the First World War, even without Italy competing for it, and with Hitler demanding military equality, cannot but weaken its position in organizing the Little Entente and force it to pay close attention to the rapid steps of Fascists welcoming war.</p>
<p>It is very clear that the god of war has spread its fierce wings again. In this cycle of war and revolution, whether it is a war to attack the Soviet Union, or whether it is the re-division of colonial markets between empires, the Second World War is ultimately inevitable and will be of decisive significance. The imperialist powers are using every means to propagate and organize their own people, under the slogan of saving the motherland, to be cannon fodder, and film art has become their best tool. On this point, all imperialists are actively using this weapon, and the French production (The Battle of Verdun) is by no means a special phenomenon.</p>
<p>Then, (The Battle of Verdun) was produced under such circumstances, so as a war film that emerges to organize war, it will naturally not expose the truth of the imperialist war, but only uses (German-French animosity) as an excuse, acting as a cover for the true cause of dividing the market and carving up colonies. Although the struggle between Germany and France for European hegemony has also become one of the driving forces of the war. Who is the instigator of the war? Pudovkin said it well in (The End of St. Petersburg): on the front line, millions of toiling masses are bleeding and sacrificing, while bankers and entrepreneurs in the rear are drinking and making merry. At the same time, Remarque's (All Quiet on the Western Front) also provides a real picture: when Paul returns from the front line, those pastors and entrepreneurs do their best to seduce him. Under the guise of the Saar mining area and the glory of the motherland, they want innocent young people to be their cannon fodder.</p>
<p>But the author of (The Battle of Verdun), Leon Poirier, explains in a professor's lecture to the Boy Scouts that the continuous sacrifice of French soldiers under machine guns, cannons, and poison gas is (fulfilling their responsibility to the country). He led a group of children to visit the Verdun battlefield, recounting the course of the war. Although he also talked about the cruelty of the war, seeming to have a bit of an anti-war element, this was to illustrate the difficulty of the fighting at that time, that the soldiers who were lured, oppressed, and driven to the battlefield sacrificed for the glory of the motherland. Moreover, every film with war as its theme, when they depict war, they have no way to explain the inhumanity of war. Furthermore, under the professor's preaching attempt, it is precisely to drive those who have not died to die for the Iron Cross when the Second World War comes.</p>
<p>Regarding Leon Poirier, in the silent film era, he was not an accomplished film writer, but in the sound film era, he did not achieve special success. In this film, he did not create a tight story, so the fragmented so-called historical records make people feel unusually dull in the sound of machine guns and cannons. In the middle, it is only the connection of each war scene. Although there are also scenes of family separation, desertion, love, etc., in terms of weight, it becomes redundant. Therefore, technically, it cannot be called a successful work.</p>

<h3>Baby Take A Bow (5)</h3>
<p>— Cao Shi</p>
<p>One night passed. By the next morning, Eddie and Laurie were carefully reading the (Help Wanted) advertisements in the morning paper. Kay went out to buy things for Shirley. The child watched her go sullenly, then ran to the street to wait for her. She wished her dad would come out and play with her, but Dad was busy. At this time, a man hurried over. Shirley looked at him strangely. She suddenly recognized that this man was the one who talked to her yesterday. (Hey, mister, what about the gift you said you'd give me yesterday?) She asked. Stone suddenly stopped, looking around quickly. No one was there... He pulled out a string of shiny beads and put them in Shirley's hand. (Is this it? Take them upstairs to play... Don't lose them!) He said. Shirley thanked him, held the beads tightly, and went upstairs. The man sneaked into the alley and disappeared. Shirley ran upstairs, shouting to her dad: (Hey, Dad, guess what I got?) But her dad ignored her. Her soft lips pouted. (I want you to play with me). But her dad pushed her away again, saying: (I don't have time to play!) Shirley said: (I'll hide something, and you find it!) She looked at Eddie's pocket, gently hid the beads in it, and walked away smiling.</p>
<p>The dining room door opened gently, and Welch walked in. He looked at them coldly, (I'm here to search for the beads). Eddie said: (What does it have to do with us!) Welch said: (The beads haven't been pawned... And they can't fly. The only answer is... They're here!) Eddie said: (If you think they're here, then search). Eddie stood up, raised his hands, and let him search. Welch stretched out his hand to touch one of his pockets, then stopped and said: (What do you take me for? Even if you had them, you wouldn't hide them on your body). He looked around the room arrogantly, searching everywhere, in the coffee pot, in the vase, under the table, he searched everything, but found nothing. Finally, he shouted angrily: (Tell me! Where are the beads?)</p>
<p>From the doorway came Shirley's clear, loud voice, (Dad... Did you find them?) Welch smirked triumphantly at them, and walked toward Shirley with a winning attitude, holding a strange-looking box, looking at her suspiciously. (Who are you?) she asked. Welch said: (I'm your father's friend... Have you seen a nice string of beads?) (Are you playing hide-and-seek too?) she asked. Welch nodded and said: (Yes, looking for something.) Shirley smiled and said: (Then go find it!) Welch stood up suspiciously and said: (Oh, just like your bad father.) He suddenly saw the box in Shirley's hand. He glared at her terribly. (What's in this box of yours?). Welch no longer pretended to be friendly. He grabbed the box... The lid flew open, and a long green snake was bounced up by a spring, hitting him in the face. Shirley burst out laughing. Welch's face turned red.</p>
<p>Outside, Eddie and Laurie were laughing at Welch's trick. Suddenly, Laurie asked him for a match. There was a lighter box on the table, but he had learned a terrible lesson and dared not take it. So he asked Eddie for one. Eddie reached into his pocket... A look of horror appeared on Eddie's face. Slowly, fearfully, he withdrew his hand and stared at the thing in his hand. (Shirley...) he mumbled in confusion, and soon suddenly understood: (It's Stone!) Laurie also stared at the shiny beads with a pale face. Welch's voice was getting closer. (If you tell me, I'll give you a big box of candy,) he coaxed the child. (To be continued)</p>
