<p>時評</p>
<h3>德國政敎之爭告一段落</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>歐電傳希特勒對於宗敎之統制政策。現已放度。前此反對政府此種企圖之二主敎。亦已準備復職。而穆勒主敎且有辭職之說云云。果如所傳。則德國政敎之爭。從此或可告一段落矣。</p>
<p>德國國社黨。自去年三月執政之後。即從事於所謂集體國家之運動。因勢乘便。將所有政黨。依次消滅。迨各政黨皆歸消滅之後。即轉其視缐於宗敎機關。其中雖受限制而仍能維持其自治權力。者唯有天主敎。蓋一則有羅馬敎皇之支持。二則薩爾區域。多屬天主敎徒。希氏日夜盼望薩爾之歸還德國。故於天主敎徒之信仰自由。自不能不稍示優容。顧其於基督敎之統制。則自去年六月以來。著著進行。不遺餘力。其統制之方。即由國社黨之基督敎徒中。推一國社黨之信徒名穆勒者。爲德國全國總主敎。將德國之敎會。改組爲德國國家敎會。主論行動。與國社黨打成一片。國社黨排斥猶太人。彼等亦從而排斥猶太人。國社黨員效忠於希特勒。國家敎會之敎士。亦須效忠於希氏。且鑿附會。公認德國國社派之革命。即爲神之所啟示。同時對於不能茍同此種措施而表示反對之敎士牧師。悉予撤職。敎會產業。亦爲沒收。對於彼等之言論集會結社等等行動。無不多方壓抑。察其意旨。似在使宗敎爲政治之附庸。敎會爲政治領袖之工具而已。</p>
<p>唯自穆勒仗政黨之權力。被任爲全國總主敎以來。爲時已將一年有半。其中被撤職之敎士。其數雖達八百以上。敎會之被接收而受統制者。雖達二十二州。未被統制者。僅餘西南部分之數州。然反對穆勒之運動。不獨不因是而稍衰。抑且有再接再厲之勢。如穆勒受任之初。反對派即發宣言。主張宗敎事件。不應受政治力量之拘束。蓋基督徒之使命。在行神之意旨。不應作任何個人之工具也。至去年底。敎士緊張急聯合會成立。亦致哀的美頓書於穆勒。聲稱穆氏著再一意孤行。擾亂敎會之和平。則彼等將不再對彼信任。至今年正月。穆氏實施敎會獨裁。敎士之主張步武馬丁路德以抗違反聖經敎義之行動者。實緊有徒。雖以警察暴力之壓迫。曾不能抑阻反抗潮流之日趨高漲。及四月間。雅谷爾被任國家敎會法律管理委員之後。統制運動。推行更烈。其意以爲敎會之中。亦須定於一尊。否則即難和平。唯反對派即表抗議。於五月底組織一國家自由敎會。申斥穆勒濫用職權。其言其行。悉與新約背謬。其扼要之點。約有六端。（一）否認國社黨之革命爲神意之表現。（二）重申基督之權力與愛高於其他一切。（三）國社黨之民族主義。未以基督敎之啟示爲基礎。不能視爲至高無上之原則。（四）敎會不當效法世俗之組織。故以國社黨之統治施之敎會。絕對不可。（五）敎會應超脫政治。不應供政治之驅使。（六）敎會除神而外。不能侍奉其他主人觀此六點。可知反對派之立塲不獨辭嚴義正。抑且氣魄不凡大有茍能護敎。雖赴湯蹈火。肝腦塗地。亦所不辭之概。是故國社黨施之其他政黨可以成功。而施之宗敎未必能有成者。其理已顯然矣。</p>
<p>查希特勒於未上臺之前。不獨無統制宗敎之意思。抑且有不干涉宗敎自由之宣言。及至各種政黨。皆爲消滅而後。以爲任何事件。茍以國社黨之精神毅力行之。無有不能成功之理。於是始有統制宗敎之企圖。至其反抗勢力若是之大。則固非彼初意所及料也。然德意志爲新敎之發祥地。新敎之起。即以舊敎之權力過於集中於上層。統治組織。過於官僚化。故欲代之以接近民衆。爲一種比較民治的新敎今穆勒一派之所爲。無乃有類於中世紀之舊敎。權力集於主敎之手。敎義又多所曲解。推乎其極。自非至於失卻耶敎真義不止也。德之基督敎徒。稟承路德之遺風。久浴新敎自由之精神。起而爲護敎之運動。其勢力之滂薄鬰積。一發而不可收。實爲意料中事。德國當局。設若一意孤行。雖未必即能釀成內亂。然其足以招致其他各耶敎國之反感。從而重增外交上之困難。或亦爲應有之結果。況耶敎徒之真有信仰者。終不爲威武所屈。強施統制。徒曠時日國家不獨不能收一心一德之效。抑且有自相分裂之虞。今希特勒憣然悔悟。決意放棄統制宗敎之謀。其見解不失爲高人一等也。</p>

<p>［倫敦］關於各處市參事會選舉確定結果、現已揭曉、工黨較前多得四三八席、其中三九四席、係奪取保守黨原有之席數、工黨勝利情形、即該黨領袖亦非意料所及、僅以倫敦一處而論、全市各區參事會二十有八、其中十五區完全入於工黨之手中、（以前僅佔四區、其他十三區、則工黨所佔議席數額亦已增多、大抵此次選民投票者爲數有限、而工黨門爭精神、亦霄不遇強烈抵抗、故其勝利乃殊易易耳、政府對於投票結果之徵兆、決不忽視、且將因此益積極進行舉國一致之宣傳、（此項宣傳、係出首相麥唐納之意、當於今年冬季加以推廣）至在一般政治及外交方面、則選舉結果、頗足發生影響、間接言之、係對政府保守政策這一種訾議、亦無可置疑、按近數年來、英國人民、對於國際問題注重情形、顯然可見、在普通選民目光中、各種外交問題中、以軍縮爲要、故就此次民意之變遷、而推斷選民不滿於保守政策、允非過當也、上月中旬英國國聯會恊會、舉辦大規模全國公民投票、對於維護和平之方法、徵求國民意見、當在一個月以內、予以答復、人民對於政府所採政策、究抱何種態度、不久當有重要之指示、吾人拭目俟之可也、</p>
<h3>防止煽亂議案三讀通過下院</h3>
<p>［倫敦］今日下午院辯論防止煽亂議案在最後階段時、反對黨領袖監所唐以激昻之論調、發言四十分鐘、挾擊該案、謂關於該案之必要、渠未聞有絲毫明證云、藍氏又對於政府指反對該案者非擁護言論自由、實鼓勵犯罪活動一節、竭力駁斥、其舊日之勇氣仍未稍衰、首相麥唐納曾蒞院答覆工黨議員米爾納所舉渠曾致函大戰時嘗受徒刑之某和平派中人、予以嘉勉一節、謂今昔情不同、不能相較、渠之擁護該案、實記憶往日之一切、該案志在保護國家之自由、渠入休息室予以贊助時、實爲試行對民衆之職責云、該案旋付三讀、以二四一對六五票通過、今將移送上院討論、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］衆院今日以極大多數通過爭執最烈之煽亂法、該案於三讀後即以二百四十一票對六十五票通過、此事至堪驚人、因衆院討論該案時各方曾一再反對之也、該案規定、任何人煽惑帝國軍隊叛亂者應處監禁、警察有權搜查私人住宅及其他房屋、凡遇形跡可疑者即可簽發搜查證、該案一讀二讀係於上屆國會辦妥、其最後一讀、則列入本屆國會議事日程、且爲本屆國會最重要之議案、政府亦顉廖案能在十一月底成立、該案提議人英斯基並主張該案之宗旨、僅在保護英國之海陸空軍人、使其不受共產黨及其他秘密宣傳之影響、反對者抨擊該案稱、其帶有法西斯主義色彩並以監禁恫嚇、以箝制英人、表示政見、非戰派稱、該案將資利用以危害和平主義者、該案於通過前、曾稍經修正、以平反對者之憤、但於該案之實質並無影響也、（二日國民電）</p>
<h3>增稅問題日閣運命所繋</h3>
<p>藏相突訪元老招致物議</p>
<p>［東京］政友會關於增稅問題、以爲政府不圖財政稅制之改革、復不樹立救濟災害之對策、徒迎合一部分勢力、漫然實施部分的增稅、故絕對反對云因、因此增稅案苦在議會提出、勢必否決或竟審議未畢、故其時藤藏相以及現內閣或總辭職、否則惟有解散議會之一途、因此增稅問題、將成爲左右內閣運命之重大問題、（三日電通電）</p>
<p>［東京］藤井藏相之增稅決意訪問園公之結果、業已確定、俟與岡田首相會見、決定政府首腦部之態度、首相將絕對支持藏相、即閣內之空氣、亦知增稅萬不可免、故大藏當局之新增稅案、將一致通過閣議、軍部大臣、對於增稅祇有贊成、斷不反對、所成爲問題者政友會在議會之強硬態度而已、岡田首相對此對策如何、殊堪注目、又藏相之增稅計畫、如增加郵費編入鐵道益金等、尚未充分得關係各省之諒解、來年度將不實行云、（三日電通電）</p>
<p>［東京］藤井藏相、首對於閣員無論矣、即對岡田首相亦未洩露意思、突然缺席閣議而出於訪問元老之舉、均認爲本末顛倒、對藏相之世評行將惡化、同時閣內對於藏相亦失去同情、或將影蠁其今有之政治的立塲、前途可抱悲觀、（三日電通電）</p>

<h3>美國民衆反日空氣濃厚</h3>
<p>願助政府充實海軍</p>
<p>希望英美聯合制日</p>
<p>［華盛頓］政府官員今日咸覺美國人民對「滿洲國」煤油專賣問題之日本態度、日本國內對英美油商之限制、以及日本海軍之恫嚇漸增不耐、據稱此種不耐心理、於數月前日本政府發表其獨覇中國之宣言時即見端倪、及至現在則因煤油爭執及日本海軍代表對於倫敦談話態度之強硬而臻極點、政府高級官員宣稱、美國人民對於海軍條約之繼續與否、事實上已不復關心、而預備贊助充實太平洋海軍根據地之防禦計劃矣官方並表示其信心稱、美國人民之心理既如此、如日本堅持建造更多之戰艦、則將全力贊助政府、日本每造三艦、則美國決造五艦云、重要報紙所載之社論·著名政治觀察者之演說及談話·以及其他民意之表示、莫不以爲日本經濟·政治·及軍事勢力之深入中國、均與其海軍政策相符而行、其目的在排擠柘西方人退出亞洲大陸、官方繼稱、各界咸信如欲倫敦海軍談話有何成就、則英美之團結爲不可少、英國自知日本之海軍力、已較英國屬地方面之海軍力爲優、故日本勢力再增、則所受之損失亦較美國爲多、是以英國希望維持現在之海軍比率、亦較美國爲急切也、由是以觀、美國與英合作、實爲美官塲之意嚮、而對英國要求建造更多巡艦亦表同情、但美國亦頗具戒心、深恐美國受英國之愚、致負海軍談判失敗之責也、（二日國民電）</p>
<h3>僞滿煤油專賣事美靜待日覆文</h3>
<p>日節略一味規避責任</p>
<p>對爭執諸要點反抹煞</p>
<p>美準備作進一步抗議</p>
<p>［華盛頓］美國對於「滿洲國」及日本方面煤油爭執之進一步行動、現暫展緩以待日本方面正式答覆後再定行止、國務院今日接美國駐日大使格魯之電報、略述日本外務省答覆美國抗議之非正式節略、日本方面之正式覆文亦即可遞到、國務次長費列浦斯表示、日外務省之聲明、僅述日本國內之煤油問題、且於爭執各點一概抹煞、所提者盡與本案無關、故不能使人滿意、費氏並鄭重表示、國務院對於日本及「滿洲國」之煤油問題、係分別辦理、蓋自國際觀點視之、「滿洲國」之問題愈爲嚴重、日本自稱與「滿洲國」無關、曾要求美國直接與「滿洲國」交涉、華盛頓方面則認此完全爲日本躱避責任、故一俟研究日本之非正式節略後、美政府即將作進一步之抗議云、（二日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本煤油統制違反條約義務</h3>
<p>倫敦方面意見</p>
<p>［倫敦］倫敦某方面這意見、以爲「滿洲團」實施煤油專賣、實違背其曾聲明遵守之日本對華條約義務、此種專賣權給予日本資本佔百分八十之公司、誠宜招人指摘、謂「滿洲國」政府以特殊權益許給　本公司、尚有一點、即此舉是否違反華府公約第三條是、日本新煤油法之主要目的、似在存儲巨量煤油、鼓勵日本煉油實業、凡此皆有益於日政府而有損於外國油公司者也、統制煤油業之廣大權力、使日政府得、（一）規定售價、（二）決定每公司每年輸入之限額、（二）遇有必要時、強迫油公司擴大其儲油所、並在日本設立煉油廠、故諸有關係之外國主要油公司須耗費巨欵、添築儲油所、及將存油增至較現量三倍之多、而並無任何保障、能使此種浩大費用得取償於將來、質言之、諸公司用此巨欵後、難保日政府不以專斷手段規定售價、限制每年營業之限度、藉阻諸公司收回其用去經費之損失也、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>海會形勢危迫英美覔求折衷方案</h3>
<p>日本仍堅持平等要求</p>
<p>美主張稍修正現行約</p>
<p>［倫敦］日代表山本海軍少將今日向路透訪員發言曰、「日本不欲稍離其海軍方案之基本原則、日本視此爲絕對不能更動」、繼又作一言、益表示其言之沉重曰、「吾人含此無他道也」、</p>
<p>當此局勢危迫之際、一切現集中於美總代表臺維斯與英外相西門之談話、兩要人昨日午後曾密談兩次、且尚將續會也、可靠方面皆信英美代表現正努力覔求一方式、容納日本對「理論的平等」之要求、日代表現擁護此種要求、謂日本僅爲政治上之原因、不能承認五五三比率一類條欵之賡續、日人覺此種條文殊損其國威云、此間日人皆謂日本不欲擴張其海軍、而使力足與英美抗、日本雖於總噸位上欲得「理論的平等」、但爲經濟原因、殊不欲擴大其造艦計畫、日本願依純粹自衛之基礎、制定其海軍政策、此所以有減少大戰艦飛機母艦與萬噸巡洋艦艘數之主張、日人覺日美英之海軍勢力範圍、皆相廣隔、故接受締結新約之自衛基礎、實無困難云、</p>
<p>聞美國之態度、仍主張將現約稍加修正、賡續其效力、惟對於減少各類軍艦百分二十之議、亦殊歡迎、又聞英日專家之談話、其性質極形和諧、彼等覺彼此之政策多少相同、而關於視爲「自術的」軍艦門類之意見、實不謀而同、日本現贊助英國所主減少大巡洋長艦噸位與軍備之議、日本接受英國所提出七千噸之巡洋艦作比例上的增加之方案、英國關於驅逐艦與飛機母艦之立塲、亦爲日本海軍界所稱許、</p>
<p>日代表山本今日語路透訪員稱、日本希望其提案能爲英美明白了解、同時其本國現仍堅決不稍移動、一般人士或以爲日本尚有第二方案、渠願堅決聲明者、日方案中之基本原則、絕對不能更動、吾人並無其他代之之法、吾人之解釋、或未能使他國代表了解其真正意義、如有他種機會得續加解釋者、渠自將利用之、渠今對於結果、雖不敢具有奢望、但並未悲觀至宣布現局已成絕對之僵局、日本未作任何退縮、如他國代表提出與日本方案基本原則不相抵觸之新方案、渠願加以考慮、而力求獲得妥協、同時日本不能同意於討論如質的限制一類的之技術說而云、（二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>海軍談話無新發展</h3>
<p>三國進行外交探討</p>
<p>［倫敦］本週杪海軍談話將無新發展、昨日英政府曾將海軍談話經過情形通告意法兩大使署、此舉並不含有法意兩國參加海軍談話之意、僅爲隨時告知之尋常手續耳、</p>
<p>衆料英日美代表本週杪將從事高爾夫球戲、與訪問其友好、談話會之第二步驟、將爲英外相同西門與日大使松平之非公開談話、其期大約在下星期一日、目前之談話、限於三國總代表問非公開之會晤、蓋欲從事外交的探討、以覓取可依以續作技術討論之一種妥恊、蓋非俟於所涉及之原則商得同意、則海軍專家加入討論、實不能有所裨益也、</p>
<h3>英相調和美日意見</h3>
<p>［倫敦］關於海會初步談判、美日兩國代表最後一次會議、（十月三十一日）並無結果、故談話已暫停止、外傳現已覓得和解方案、可使談話從新舉行云云、此訊美日兩國代表團皆未予以證實、僅謂海軍談話形勢未變、雙方仍守原來立塲云云、惟首相麥唐納明日在迄葛斯地方別墅午宴、招得日本代表之時、或將再作調和日美兩國意見之企圖、此則非不可能也、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英相麥唐納與其女公子今日在其別墅欵宴日代表、此舉純爲禮尚往來、而未邀英美代表作陪、（三日略透電）</p>
<h3>美日專家各逞詞鋒</h3>
<p>今晨在倫敦從事美日談話之海軍專家、曾相聚談、當對日本所提平等要求作技術上的討論之際、美海軍大將史丹萊堅稱日本海軍之進步、已足與美國海軍平等、日本海軍不以數計、而以實際計、其強已與美相埒云、日代表山本辦稱、日本中華府公約下之比率、不復爲三與五比、三日、「吾人試證實之、吾人可彼此交換艦隊、如君以貴國海軍給余、而余以敝國海軍給君、則余之自豪將與君同」、衆聞此言、爲之歡笑、此種消息、旋傳至遠東、而視爲嚴重之障礙、但倫敦美日官員今晚宣稱、此僅爲一種笑話耳、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福認有成功望</h3>

<p>［巴黎］衆院定星期二討論杜邁格總理之憲法改革案、此事與政府之安危亦有關係、急進社會黨聞仍反對改革案中第二點、此足成爲杜邁格政治命運之關鍵、內閣中急進社會黨閣員五人現正與各領袖會議星期二應取之態度、如彼等竟持反對態度、則杜邁格內閣仍有傾覆之慮、（三日國民電）</p>
<h3>慧星號完成英澳雙程飛航</h3>

<h3>希特勒禁國社黨活動緩和薩樂緊張局勢</h3>

<p>英表示僅以國聯會員資格與聞此事</p>
<p>［柏林］自法國聲明一俟薩爾行政委員會遇有亂衙發生、請求援助時、即將遺派軍隊加以恊助之後、薩爾問題突現緊張、德國「領袖兼總理」希特勒·駐薩爾區域代表布克爾·爲緩和人心起見、特對國社黨衝鋒隊及薩爾邊境保衛隊發表禁令、謂自明年一月十日起至二月十日止、（按薩爾公民投票當於一月十三日舉行）不得在沿薩爾區域遇境四十公里以內穿著制服、列隊遊行、或舉行何項集會云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本農村苦況一斑</h3>
<p>北地苦寒農民生機全無</p>
<p>東京大阪兩大都市、近年的進行、真有一日千里之勢、凡是主要街道都修成柏油面路、木造的洋式建築、也已普遍的流行、男女學生著舊式裙裳的不過十分之一二、男學生雖不曾穿很漂亮的西裝、可是制服很整潔、女學生大都有幾分華貴氣了、總之日本都市的發達、確足以追蹤歐美而無愧色、一般社會非常時期的緊張情結、因為軍事當局的提倡、所以除上中層社會特別高之外、普通一般人也就祇那麼一回事罷了、至於農村間呢、農民們苦於生活壓迫、當然要先顧自已的肚皮了、</p>
<p>東北六縣、巖手。福島。山形。青森。宮城。秋田等縣、巖手縣因天氣太冷、農作物損失總計值三千五百萬元、貧農戶數在七萬以上、減收成分計百分之四十四、福島縣農作物損失三千二百萬元、受災農民有九萬六千戶、減收成分達百分之二十五、山形縣農產物損失總數有二千四百萬元、貧農約四萬戶減收約百分之二十五、青森縣凍災損失約二千萬元、貧農有六萬戶、減收成分在百分之四十二左右、宮城縣凍災損失總計二千五百萬元、貧農計四萬戶、減收百分之三十四、秋田縣減收最少、不過百分之十八、而損失總計也不下二千萬元、貧農還是有三萬五千戶、此外還有新瀉盛岡都不很好、祇比上述各縣稍見起色罷了、</p>
<p>這種兇年、在北陸地方、據以往歷史的記載、是有週期性的、但自明治二年以來（一八六九年）到如今、差不多有十次的災荒、但以今年為最厲害、例如山形縣屬的最上郡地方、竟有「沒有婚嫁、沒有食物」的農村、許多的農民都將他們十三四歲的女孩押　給人家、或賣給人　家去做酌婦、（略似女招待）做女工、作娼妓、作丫頭、其代價也祇七八十元、然而現在還是深秋、正是收穫的時期、多少還可以收點東西進來、卻已經將兒女出賣、到了積雪時期、地上毫無出產、不知又該怎樣哩、</p>
<p>山形縣屬下農村中、粿粒無收的有四千町、（每町合華畝一四畝八八）其減收在百分之七十以的有一萬三千町、減收在百分之　五十以上的　有一萬六千二百千町、平常年成可收二百萬石、今年最大限數祇能收一百二十三萬石、那些受過水淹發育不成熟的稻葉、用來搓繩子都要不得、馬吃了也要下痢、</p>
<p>秋田縣農產減收成分是比較少的、其減收的估計也有四十四萬石、山間較高的地區、大都毫無收穫、現時收穫期間、田裹沒有稻子可割、他們於是全家總動員到山上去拾栗子青剛子、採商陸葉、掘蕨根、預備留到冬季下雪的時候來過冬、在小學校唸書的兇童、幾乎都告了假、上山去檢栗子、普通農家、多數的人每天勞作結果、得不到十錢的（約銀幣九分）收入、</p>
<p>青森縣所屬的九戶郡的農民、真是窮得沒有辦法、因為飯沒有吃、必不得已而將他們的耕牛賣去、價值百元以上的牛、不過賣五十元、他們的食糧、主要的是稗子、其次是麥子、佐餐的祇有王瓜鹹菜、其大多數人吃的是（一）麥餅、約百分之二十麵粉、其餘是麩、（二）糠餅、有百分之二十的麵粉、其餘是米糠、（三）馬鈴薯餅、山芋不去皮、合些蘿葡、再加上約百分之十的麵粉製成、（四）紅薯餅、其裂法興馬鈴薯餅同、不過主要原料是紅薯、（五）松皮餅、是將松皮赤色部分剝下來、用灰水煮後、興糯米混合起來、搗碎成粉末作餅、這還是現在存糧未完、秋收末了的時候、就有上面所述的吃法、那末隆冬到來的時候、恐怕連青剛子蕨根也會缺乏了、（一九三四年十月廿二日於秋田）</p>

<h3>國立北平故宮博物院文獻館工作報告</h3>
<p>弁言</p>
<p>本館所藏史料、以清代檔案為大宗、卷帙繽紛、種類繁雜、其中要事珍聞固所在多有、而平凡尋常之文件、茍比類綜合以求之、尤足供史家之所取材、且也、一代檔案所記載之政治法律經濟風俗　恒足以反映當代國家社會之一般文化、其重要性之程度、要皆隨研究者眼光不同而有差別、故離斷簡殘篇、莫不可資探討、不當於此存軒輊之偏見也、</p>
<p>往者本館亦　編次若干有關清史之重要材料問諸世矣、磊抵皆零星賦抬、故多掛一漏萬、其弊要在不待基本工作、普遍整理之完成、而急求表現、有以致之、欲速則不達、此之謂也、本館有見於是、自此次改組後　即決定辦法、以全力注重普遍之整理、分北平現存史料軍機處之照會、函電、內閣大庫之黃冊、檔冊、內務府之各種檔案為若干組、同時整理、先因名以立類、再即類以編目、</p>
<p>顧整理檔案較之部　　　、難易迴殊、書籍以整部全帙為單位、檔案以寄件散頁為單位、一也、書籍分類有中西之成規可循、檔案則無定法、二也、書籍編目有書名可據檔案須隨件擇由、（原案由多不適用）三也、故以言分類、必先考所據職官之禁屬、衙習之司掌、以言編目、必先研究公文之程式、檔案之術語、凡此種種、除於檔案本身中探討外、尚須參證典籍、訪詢耆獻、以期及早完成此基本工作、（南運檔案他目亦當本此原則整理之）然後仿記事本末之體例、將關於清代各大事之案件、依事按目編成索引、藉作重修清史之長編、以供史家之參考、至於整理時隨手發現之材料、仍由文獻業編甄錄隨時發表、聯以引起研究者之興趣而已、</p>

<p>憲法草案呈送中央</p>
<p>憲法草案全部通過後、現已呈送國民政府、轉呈中央、預定明年四月間、召開國民大會通過後、卽可頒布、現以五全大會展期　行、國民大會自將因以展緩、故預料憲法頒佈之期、最早當在明年秋季、</p>
<p>刑法民法業經通過</p>
<p>刑法民法業經立法院大會通過、刑事訴訟法、二星期內、亦可提出討論、預料本月底可告完成、刑訴法完成後　民事訴訟法亦將繼之提出討論、一俟通過卽可公佈、實行之期、約在明年春間　蓋公佈須有三四月之時間　以便全國各級法院有所準備也、破產法亦在草擬之中、此法在我國尚屬創舉、以前並未有過、預料明正、可望提出立法院大會討論、</p>

<h3>上海貨公司二週紀念盛況</h3>
<p>吳市長夫婦偕女界領袖</p>
<p>林克聰女士播音及參觀</p>
<p>本埠南京路虹廟對面上海國貨公司、自鄔志豪、陸祺生兩先生創辦以來、貨真價實、素為各界所贊許、故營業極為發達、昨日值該公司二週紀念、特請海上聞人兪佐庭袁履登鄭正秋洪雁賓等及藝術名家、前往播音　吳市長夫婦偕女界領袖林克聰女士及閔竺一女士馬小姐等親往播音、並往公司參觀各部、由總經理鄔志豪親自招待、對於內部設備　允稱完美、至三時許、盡興而去、茲錄吳市長演說辭及鄔君答詞如下、</p>
<p>吳市長演說</p>
<p>昊鐵城市長演說國貨運動的意義云、現在我們的民族是衰弱極了、我們的國家是危險極了、我們的國家民族、為什麼會危險衰弱到這步田地呢、那自然是由於不斷的內憂外患之所致　內憂是我們自已人謀的不減、外患則是帝國主義所加於我們的侵略、帝國主義的侵略、一方面是政治的、一方面是經濟的、政治的侵略、例如領土的掠奪、這是有形的侵略、經濟侵略、例如商品的傾銷、資本的移植、這是無形的侵略、無形的侵略、從國家久遠的立場看、有時會覺得比有形的侵略、還要來得可怕、譬如有人占領了我們的領土、我們自然覺得義憤填庸、要刻苦奮斗的去收復失地、但是我們年年七八萬萬元的入超、像民國十八年入超三萬萬八千九百六十四萬餘元、民國十九年入超六萬萬四千六百四十三萬餘元、民國二十年入超八萬萬一千六百四十一萬餘元、民國二十一年入超八萬萬六千七百十九萬餘元、民國二十二年入超七萬萬三千三百七十三萬餘元、在這短短的五年間、我們中國對外貿易的入超、就已達三十四萬萬五千三百四十餘萬元之百額、這就是就、在國民經濟上、我們的損失　是三十四萬萬五千三百四十餘萬元、以全國四萬萬七千萬人計、那麼我們每一個人平均損失、差不多是八元弱、這是一個何等龐大的數目、這是一個何等驚人的數目、領土的喪失、就個人講、礕如肢體的摧殘、而因貿易入超經濟侵略所引起的金融的涸竭和經濟的危機、那就無異是一個人元氣的斷傷、肢體的摧殘、我們固然要想法子來回復他、元氣的　傷、我們便能讓他這樣的無疾而終麼、那自然我　是要設法挽救的、怎樣挽救呢　我以為那就是　提倡國貨運動了、國貨運動的意義、是在使我們中國四萬萬七千萬同胞、誰都能夠直接間接的參加國貨的生產、實行國貨的消費以經濟的獨立　求民族的復興、所以國貨運動、一方面是國貨的消費運動、一方面卻是國貨的生產運動、國貨運動、是民族經濟的獨立運動、國貨運動、是民族的復興運動、凡是愛國家愛民族的人、誰都有參加國貨運動的必要、誰都有努力國貨運動之國民的義務、為什麼說國貨運動、是國貨的生產運動呢、國家和國家的競爭、是國力和國力的競爭、國力是什麼、國力就是人力加了物力財力和組織力、物力財力也就是經濟力所以國家和國家的競爭　主要的就是經濟力的競爭　英帝國為什麼是十八世紀十九世紀的霸主、那就是英國產業的先進、倫敦是世界的工場　美國在十八十九世紀間　並不是一個怎樣強盛的國家為什麼會變成二十世紀的驕子呢、那就是美國在歐戰前後、美國的工業、有了突飛猛晉的發展的綠故、近年的日本、為什麼無論反對她、庇護她、誰都不能不刮目的看她、那是因為日本這幾年來的工商業、有了驚人的發展故、反轉來說、我們中國、為什麼老是這麼感到被侵略的悲哀呢、那自然因主我們在經濟上、是被剝削者、所以我們在政治上、才是被支配者、換句話說、正因　我們國內農村的破產、工業的落後、生產力的衰頹　經濟力的薄弱、所以我們才會受到這嚴重的失地之痛的、所以如果我們不欲立國於大地則已、否則我們必須以極大的決心　和極大的毅力、來擁護國家的統一、發展民族的工業、第一步維護既存的輕工業、第二步發展重工業、如鋼鐵工業、機械工業。而尤其重要的、我們必須設法完成衣食住行生活必需品製造工業的獨立、生活必需品的製造、如果不能獨立、那麼、在平時是一種國民經濟的損失、在戰時便有受敵人對鎖的危險、所以我以為中國的國貨運動、應得是一個國貨的生產運動、必須發展國貨的生產、然後才能充實國家的國力、保障國家的生存、為什麼說國貨運動是國貨的消費運動呢、消費和生產　是相對的、生產的目的、就在於消費、消費是什麼、消費就是我們人類物質的慾望之滿足、自然　沒有國貨的生產、也就無從去愛用國貨、反轉來說、如果僅僅只有國貨的生產、而無愛國的商人愛國的民衆、來推銷國貨　購買國貨、那麼、國貨運動的成效、自然是漫不　睹的、一個人如果衣食住行、事事都要仰給於人、這個人、便是一個不長進的人、一個國家、如果　的消費　樣樣都是靠著外國　這個國家、便是一個破產的不配生存的國家、所以我以為、我們應該確立一個嚴肅的觀念、就是每一個人平常的消費行為、是關係國運的盛衰的　就令　費只是一文錢　因為如果購買外貨　　麼這一文錢、就不知不覺的流到外洋去了、這　文錢的流到外洋、第一是表示外貨輸入的增加　這在入超的中國　也就是入超的增加、第二、是表示生產資本之外溢、外貨既形入超、我們憑什麼去抵償國際收支的損失呢、那自然只有現銀出口、現銀出口、這是資本的逃避、這是國民經濟的可怕的損失、第三、是表示國內工作機會的減少、也就是失業的增加、資本是殖產興業的要件、必須社會有新興的企業、然後具有工作能力者　始自服務的機會、現在資本以入超而外流、　麼、受這資本之益的、自然是外國的工人　而我們中國的工人　就不是不盛到失業的威脅了、一文錢的外貨購買、他的損失、是這樣嚴重的、我們必須明白了這深刻的理由、我們才會覺得購買外貨是可恥的一、這句話、不是感情的空論、而實具有充份的經濟的意義、自然、我不是經濟的鎖國主義者、不過我覺得在這經濟國難時候、政府應採扶植產業的政策、人民應具提倡國貨的決心、必須朝野一致的來提倡國貨　那麼、國貨運動、才在發皇蓬勃的一天、國家民族、才有光榮復興的一天、我的話完了、</p>
<p>鄔志豪謝詞</p>
<p>總經理鄔志豪致謝詞云、今大本公司二週紀念、承吳市長光臨演講國貨運動之意義、承兪佐庭。虞治老。袁履登。鄭正秋。洪雁賓。諸先生演說、提倡國貨業用國貨之主義、並承林克聰女士提倡女界服用國貨之宗旨、不勝感謝　本公司開幕以來、已歷二週、承各界士女、鼎力贊助、源源惠顧、各大工廠、供給精美出品、本公司需要、同人所抱之主義、即以經濟扶助實業、實業以謀生產　生產以早民生、使農村得以復興、工業得以發展、國家能政富強、人才不致失業、希望全市商號　推銷國貨、各界人士、樂用國貨、以求生生不息、互相扶助之利益工業界研究出品之改良、成本之減輕、外抗經濟之侵略、內助同胞、所宜、致奮起耳、</p>
<h3>大新綢緞局設計處談國產綢緞業前途</h3>
<p>上月營業超過去年同月百分之八十</p>
<p>綢業領袖王延松氏。為　行其本位救國之主張、將三馬路石路原設之大新綢緞局、於十月一日起、改組大新國產綢緞局　犠牲兼售外貨、專銷國產綢緞、並在局內設立設計處、計劃推進業務之工作　自開幕後、上海市綢緞公會、及上海電機絲織廠業公會等公團、皆馳函贊許、而愛護國產之綢緞之熱心仕女、爭往購貨、尤為踴躍、營業極為發達、擴該局設計處處長談、就上月該局營業紀錄之觀察、國產綢緞業之前途、頗可樂觀、蓋商業戰爭之進退、完全在於購買力之爭奪、亦即人心之爭奪也　故今日經營國產事業者、茍能確持正大之主張、向外貨爭奪屬於我國人民之購買力、未有不操勝算者、近年國產綢緞業之趨於衰落、實因未盡推銷之人事所致、非國人之不愛購國產綢緞也、此次本局確定犠牲兼售外貨、完全推銷國產綢緞後、由貨類及營利之範圍言　似較前狹小、但所得之營業結果、反較前擴大、蓋上月營業總計、興去年同月相比、超過百分之八十、此實為國人愛護國產綢緞之明證、倘國產綢緞商　果能互相聯合、對外貨為有組織有計劃之競爭、前途必可樂觀云、</p>

<h3>中委王祺談藝術救國</h3>
<p>人心不古為物質慾太高之結果</p>
<p>提倡精神生活為救中國之秘訣</p>
<p>——書盡展覽會今日結束——</p>
<p>中委王祺氏、性情濛瀟　雅好番寗、雖公務忙碌、日無暇暑、而時加練習、故傑作甚多、閒情逸致、令人欣羨、此次為提倡藝術起見、特來滬在湖社開一書畫展覽會　連日參者、極為踴躍、定去作品、亦復不少、申時社記者昨特往訪王氏於湖社會所　當蒙接見、並述其對芤術感想如次、</p>
<p>古畫興今畫</p>
<p>據王氏據、我國圖畫、發達最早、迄今宋元二朝、已極發達、明清二朝、更無論矣、故圖畫現在尚日有進步、惟古畫工夫老練、今畫則別開生面、另闢述徑、種類甚多、但遠不及古畫工夫老練、</p>
<p>書法已退化</p>
<p>圖畫固日在進步、無時或已、但書法則不同、中國字即為藝術之一種、此興外國字之大有區別者即在此、但書字之進步、有一定止境、不能超過某種標準、故中國字現已退化、</p>
<p>藝術可救國</p>
<p>王氏繼談、現在世界衰亂之原因、即人類物質慾太高、不注意精神生活、因縱慾所至、在個人則身敗名裂、在國家則混亂不已、中國現在所以如果衰弱者、即為國民未注意精神生活、有以致之、余有見及此、故前崴在京時、即籌辦個人書畫展覽會、以資提倡、因京中人士、舉行書畫展覽會者甚少故也、自此次後、果然繼余後而舉行者、為數至多、故京中藝術運動發展、現已較前迅速、此次來滬舉行展覽會、亦係此意、吾思今後國民果能共同注意藝術、竭力提倡、則國民物質慾望、可漸減少、國家方能有救、記者最後叩以何日返京、據答、謂今日展覽會結束後、稍事休息、定明晚夜車返京、</p>

<h3>史高塔杯優游和猶太甲組東華挫臘克斯</h3>
<p>優游苦門猶太五比五打成和局</p>
<p>東華方興示艾五比一大挫臘隊</p>
<p>西聯足球會之史商塔杯初賽、昨優游對猶太、在申揭幕、猶太前在聯賽中會以二比七敗於優游、昨日狹路重逢、分外眼紅、加以聯絡上之吃虧、不能收幹之精神、努力抗衡優游自迭遭敗績以來、雖力事振作、卒以聯絡上之吃虧、不能收得心應乎之妙、會被猶太以五比三領前、華賴最後之努力、打成五比五和局、東華臘克斯之甲組補賽、在逸園舉行、東華自得萬象華重歸老家後、士氣益振、全場形勢、操縱東華健兒足下、結果以五比一大勝、但李義阻故性不改、中途被罰離場、殊覺遺憾耳、</p>
<p>東華克臘克斯</p>
<p>五比一敵軍喪魄</p>
<p>李義臣被罰出場</p>
<p>東華對臘克斯之甲組賽、在逸園舉行、觀者頗為踴躍、上半時中東華由萬象華由萬象華李義臣各記一功、下半時開始東華大受敵窘、先失一球、李義臣、奪發有為、卒以五比一大敗敵軍</p>
<p>連奪兩城</p>
<p>東華開球先攻、聲勢浩浩、短傳聲進、聞進番營、臘克斯固非　者、引軍招架、互相廝殺、形勢緊張、相持二十分鐘、各無勝敗、忽而東華憐將萬象華及李義臣雙騎殺進、威風凜凜、敵將士前攔架、義臣被阻、急切不能深入、乃遞興萬、萬街枚疾走、逼近門側、輕中門柱、擦入門內、首立一功、軍容益盛、個個奮勇、義臣麟經均會攻門、一一被救、三十分種時、義臣得象華發來角球、迎兩頂去、妙技媲美、又中鵠的、</p>
<p>福人天相</p>
<p>臘克斯歸運負二球、士氣並不稍稻　、立意報復、愈戰愈勇如跑沙列射門中柱、相差寸許、勃克兵出斜谷、擾亂堡壘、麥克勞平地急射、陸釧恩四腳朝天、競而脫險、真是槍林彈雨、四面楚歌、徼倖得以脫險、非特東飽受虐驚、觀眾心裹、突突如小鹿之跳躍、提心吊膽、吃驚不小、</p>
<p>禍福無常</p>
<p>上半時過後、東華危運不脫、仍在緊急時期、相持不滿十分鐘、臘克斯五虎並進、包圍城池、勃克偷空發射、陸鐘恩接而復落、被小將鮑沙列趕上再加一腳、打中鐘恩背脊彈入門內、俄而、李義臣踢傷對方守門腳踝、被罰離場、從此東華祇以十人作戰、幸而軍容整齊、猛攻如故、萬象華高球窘敵、遙送門前、陳洪光跳至前方、中途接應、由其轉交興家球、一蹴中的、又勝一球、東華遂以三比一勝、否　泰來、可謂禍福無常矣、</p>
<p>再中兩球</p>
<p>球賽至此、形勢似內定、臘克斯縱然野心勃、力圖復地、仾困於東華之防禦、一籌莫展、東華聲勢如故、猛攻不已、廿五分鐘時、洪光麟經合作傳進、由萬象華再中一球、最後十分鐘時、潛服未見之賈幼良、突然活動、邊疆起義、家球應接有功、一腳中敵將史坦格背、彈中門柱、將入之際、守門仆地拍出、但裁判已宣告入門、遂成五比一之結果</p>
<p>東華隊　萬象華　李寗　頒尚動　李義臣　肆　馮運佑　戴麟經　關泃安　陳洪光　陳家球　賈幼良</p>

<p>優游苦戰猶太</p>
<p>拖泥帶水喪潰平平</p>
<p>十二碼造成五比五</p>
<p>優游近兩週來士氣渙散、軍無斗志、昨遇猶太作施高塔盃之初賽、進攻退守殊不自然、上半時僅能以二比二打成平手、下半時節節虐於猶太壓迫之下、一　會以五對三危險之局面、屈居下鳳、幸不久即為羅孫二將、努力　得以不敗、亦云險矣、綜觀昨賽雙方表演俱見平平、下半時　甚、結果五對五和局、尚須重賽、</p>
<p>開場白一往一來</p>
<p>優游開球、行軍不利、後防漏洞時呈、猶太五鋒　活刁躦之伎倆、予優游以猛烈攻擊　宮禁之地、險象環生、江王二衛　東擋西刦、疲於奔命、良久、猶太右路軍滂陲深入底線、傳中、格林勃一軍奪起、搶立頭功、優游先失一球、激起全軍憤慨、梅洪賓拆直入移交老孫、橫身怒射、亦告得乎、</p>
<p>攻勢急勝敗難分</p>
<p>鎮祥腳頭不穩、踢出之球、不高即遠、殊使接者發生困難、因是失機屢屢、羅海光興老彝不能自美妙之合作、打門之機會極少、勃林蓋動如脫免小鬍子雲逢　遮攔不定、Ｓ格林勃拚命掃去、徐享躍起撲球、不料太早球由背上飛入綱中、成二對一、鐘勇森努氣填胸、孤軍深入、羅海光半途接濟、近水樓臺、又成和局、</p>
<p>得失易撲朔迷離</p>
<p>休息未已、戰馬又號、優游蓄志猛攻、猶太隊亦人人奮勇、不得共門而入者凡三四次、敵左翼伏軍突起、王樹森阻之不力、中鋒勃林蓋及時發腿、再奏奇功、此時優游反攻盆急、雙方求勝心切、動作時見粗暴、鐘勇森闖入中線以後、施一頭功、Ｇ格林勃悔不該以乎代足　乃被判罰中十二碼、孫鐵腿踢得太準、為守門拍成角球、看客十分惋惜、幸不久鐘低射、從右門角倒彈入綱、三度媾和、</p>
<p>驚且喜雌莫辨</p>
<p>未五分鐘、孫鐵腿長傳梅洪貴、再入中央、羅海光在亂軍中拾得一球、猛烈射門、其急無倫、不料適為狄克非肚皮彈出、此球雖未進門、但敵人已虛驚不小、派切克趁渾水捉魚、遙射得手、勃林蓋繼之以高射、竟萬五三之數、羣料優游反攻無術、必拜下風、孰知風雲變幻、小羅對門試技、Ｇ格林勃真是禍水、實行倒撥入門、此時戰情更見事不妙、競非法絆人、再罰十二碼、孫鐵腿立罰送入敵門、如成五比五和局、裁判宣佈時間終了、下次仍須重賽、</p>

<h3>礦石檢波能力之測定</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>在沒有談到本文以前，關於礦石所以能檢波的理論，也得提先說明一下。</p>
<p>檢波，並不限定使用某種器械，或某種物質，凡是具有整流作用的物質，便多可以拿來做檢波的用途。換句話說：凡是具有單向性導體（Ｕnilateral　Conductivity）的物質，便具有檢波作用。</p>
<p>所謂單向性，便是，電流在導體上某一個方向通過時，電阻很低，在換在一個方向時，導體便產生很大的電阻，電流便立即減少，或竟減至零點。</p>
<p>第一圖，爲普通檢波礦石之特性曲綫。當電壓爲正方向時，電流極大。爲負方向時，電流幾減至零點，因此，外來高週率交流電波的下半部，便都被牠一律截掉，而成單方向的低週率顫動電流。（如第一圖Ａ所示）</p>
<p>我們知道，聽筒所以能夠發生聲浪，是由於內部電流變動所致。電流變動的數值愈大，發出的聲浪便愈響。如果礦石機欲求其發聲響亮，那麼礦石在某一方向時，便須求其電阻愈小愈好，在另一方向時，便須求其愈大愈好。再說得明顯些：便是，礦石在同一電壓下，兩方向電流相差的數值愈大，聽筒內發出的聲浪便愈響，同時，牠的靈敏度也愈佳。</p>
<h3>第一圖</h3>
<p>本篇所介紹的測量礦石檢波能力的方法，便是根據了上述的原理而設計的。如第二圖，Ｖ爲電壓表，Ｂ爲相當數值的電池。先將礦石置在ＸＸ處，測量之，假定電壓表上所得的數值爲E1，再將礦石換一方向，假定得到的數值爲Ｅ2，那麼；</p>
<h3>第二圖</h3>
<p>礦石檢波能力E1－Ｅ2（答整正負不拘）測騐時，如；</p>
<p>一，兩方向電流數值相等—接觸必太緊，或內部已成短路。</p>
<p>二，兩方向電流數值相差過小—接觸太鬆或接觸於不甚靈敏之點。</p>
<p>三，兩方向電流均無數值—內部未曾接觸，或接觸點積有塵垢。</p>
<p>四，數值不穩定—觸鬚彈性太鬆，或礦石本身搖動。</p>
<h3>減免自電源傳入之雜聲</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>交流收首機內發出之雜聲，有時並不自收音機本身發出，而自其電源綫傳入而引起者。此種雜聲當然爲聽者所厭惡，而亟欲摒去之。減免之法，非改動收音機內部所可奏效，必須自電源綫方面著想也。</p>
<p>實際上，免除此種雜聲亦極容易，但須在電源引入綫上加接一如圖甲或乙之裝置。二圖之功用相同，但甲圖之效果較佳。圖中之電容器，每只之容量均爲二兆分法拉特，其耐壓強度最好的有五百伏脫。甲圖中之射電週率阻流圈，各用二十二號至二十八號這紗包綫，於一英寸直徑之圓管上繞一百圈。使用時，其左面之二頭接於電源綫上，其右面之二頭則接於收音機上之電源引之入綫上。</p>
<h3>修理電動擴聲器</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>電動擴聲器發生障礙的時候，倘自已有修理常識，則可立刻動手修復，免得請敎於人，故本文以引介紹於諸同志、</p>
<p>修理電動擴聲器，應先明瞭電動擴聲器的原理與構造，牠能夠發音的原因，全持連任在空懸圓錐（Ｃone　）上的音圈（Voice　Coil），經過成音週率電流後，在空氣中振動而發音，圓錐的底邊支於鐵框架上，音圈周圍則有蛛綱板（Ｓpider），以使圓錐常伿持中心位置，（請參看附圖內，蛛綱板使圓錐振動時，與錐面常成垂直）圓錐頂上的音圈在磁極的空隙間振動，電磁石上有母磁圈或稱塲閱（Ｆield　Coil）以輸入外來的直流電源，使激勵磁塲強度。</p>
<p>圍閉母磁圈外面的鐵殻，非獨爲保護母磁圈，且使完成磁路的作用，若成音電流輸入於音圈，使成電磁石牠的磁力綫與空懸的磁塲起一反作用，換言之，即力綫彼此排斥，因此，圓錐隨音圈而顫動，發爲聲音。</p>
<p>此式擴聲器甚易發生沙音，顫音及雜音等弊病，或有時音弱而竟致不聞，爰將其發生弊病及修理法述後。</p>
<p>—甲—　若此縫脫膠則須重膠　若有破裂須回膠水或洋乾漆塗上以修補　—乙—　蛛綱板常在此中斷乃致發生沙音　用紙板剪一新蝣回板用洋乾漆或膠水塗之換上　—丙—襯片　音圖母磁圈　襯片使音圈守中　—丁—　梳頭處常有繼缐田須加注意</p>
<p>較騐母磁圈</p>
<p>第一個較騐擴聲器的步聚，須知道磁塲強力如何，最簡單的方法，當擴聲器接在收音機上後，用旋鑿一把置於磁極旁，視其吸力強弱，倘欲較爲準確，則用精確的歐姆表以測量母磁圈的歐姆數（附註：用精確的千分安培電流表亦能測得，用公式（歐姆＝弗打×1000千分安培）計算之，倘若綫圈燬斷，或有一部分短路則拆開而將綫圈重繞或以適合的新綫圈代入。</p>
<p>在從前老式的交流擴聲器，磁塲的母磁圈皆用氧化銅整流器（Ｃopper　Oxide　）使交流改成直流，此式的擴聲器，歷時稍久，致成衰弱，所以須欲重較騐磁塲的固定強度。</p>
<p>若檢得磁塲甚佳，第二個步聚，乃較騐擴聲器音圈與圓錐，惟此工作，並格外留意，其大概的弊病如下：</p>
<p>弊病的原因</p>
<p>（一）音圈在內部中斷或在軟綫接頭處斷</p>
<p>（二）音圈因局部或全部短路，以致彼此跨接</p>
<p>（三）音圈偏斜，與磁極摩擦</p>
<p>（四）括辣聲常由於圓錐接縫鬆弛，膠在圓錐上的蛛綱板或音圈綫漸鬆：有時音圈綫漸鬆而脫離紙圈管</p>
<p>（五）音圈受潮而軟，及蛛綱板支持未妥或破裂，或因圓錐外邊的鬆弛，則起剝碎聲。</p>
<p>以上五點，爲擴聲器發生幣病的主因（除擴聲器損壞與圓錐破裂外）</p>
<p>襯片的使用</p>
<p>擴聲器經較騐後，而知牠的弊病在音圈偏斜，則須將支住蛛綱板的螺釘旋鬆細心挿入薄度適宜的鋼襯片於磁極問，請參看圖丙，乃旋緊螺釘，移去襯片，圓錐能保持原來中央位置；如若蛛綱板未有圓錐是不會改移的，此類弊病約有百分之七十五以上，可用此簡法修復</p>
<p>倘用上法較騐而不能，若手頭有修理的工具，則將圓錐拆去而重待較騐，當拆圓錐時，須謹慎留意，母使稍有損傷，在許多新式擴聲器中，圓錐的鑲邊皆膠住的，須先使鑲邊得飽和的溶劑後，膠乃漸漸脫離，（鬆去黏膠，約需時五分鐘至十分鐘許）均勿用水，則毀壞圓錐，且不能使膠脫離。</p>
<p>圓錐的試騐</p>
<p>圓錐既移去後，宜加嚴密試騐，鬆弛的部分須重膠牢，若見音圈變樣，已不甚圓，則用適合的圓管挿入綁緊，並用薄膠水微塗於表面，硬後即不致變樣，塗蕪膠水時，應用手指以辦別厚薄如何，少則多塗點，多則用溶劑洗去而重塗。</p>
<p>圓錐的接縫，亦須微塗膠水，若見蛛綱板損壞，則剪成附圖乙式樣塗膠水或洋乾漆（Ｓhellac）後換入，圓錐重膠後，須待其乾燥，約一小時左右，乃再裝入，（膠水能在十五分鐘內乾了，惟待一小時後裝入，較爲妥當）圓錐裝入的時，襯片仍須挿入，乃旋緊螺釘，使圓錐邊縫重行膠住而乾妥後，乃將襯片㧞去。</p>
<p>有時見音圈損壞過甚，則惟有重換一新的而膠於圓錐上。</p>
<h3>賴那茲式配諧器</h3>
<p>— 鑑</p>
<p>賴那茲式配諧器係德人賴那茲（Ｒeinatz）所發明者，爲自感量與電容量兩用之回授方式（Ｒegeneration），如下圖所示，其能率佳，調節亦易，故廣用於短波長之接收。此電路之調節，最初應先轉動天綫轉換器Ａ，天綫經綫圈L1與次級電路L2相交連。次使C3爲零，調節L2C2接近於所要波長。然後加減L3接近於L2，同時加減Ｃ2與C3，以求收音最清晰之點。上圖甲與乙亦爲根據同一原理之電路，甲圖之配諧操作由變量器（Ｖariome　tor）司之。乙圈爲將自感量綫圈繞於同一圓筒者，天綫之連接係在地綫端各引出二，四，五，六，七，八，九，十回之處，任意選擇一適當之點。而回授度之大小則由加減屏電容器Ｃ1而得。</p>

<h3>二根相絞絕緣綫的用途</h3>
<p>— 薇葦</p>
<p>把二根絕緣的導綫彼此相紋，便成一隻徵量的電容器，它的容量是以二綫相絞之長度爲斷。雖然它的容易很小，可是用處倒不小，如（圖一Ａ）所示，它的工作是使真空盧振湯。圖Ｂ是做成一隻天綫補償電容器，假使把二根相絞的接在變量電容器的動片與定片之間，就能使刻度盤上度數稍加更變圖Ｃ示綫圖更變波長的方法，假使一個綫圖剛巧缺少一圈或半圈，要加極麻煩，不加呢，波長缺少一叚，或者湊巧波長長的電臺就因此收不到，如果你照圖上這樣做，一定會增加些波長。</p>
<h3>第一啚</h3>
<h3>短波機中的柵漏</h3>
<p>被燒毀或因其他而至失効的柵漏，我們可以拿低週率變壓器中拆出來的綫或用三十八號漆巴綫密繞在柵上，（這樣就成了一個高週率阻流綫圖）二綫頭就用錫焊在柵漏的二鋼頭上如圖二）做好了，放在短波機當柵漏，非便能減少雜聲，而且在收音方面也改進不少。</p>
<h3>電源變壓器的短路檢查</h3>
<p>我們自已繞製電源變壓器，每每因粗莽之故，於不知不覺間，內中的綫圈已成短路，假使我們接上電綫，覺察得早還好，覺察得遲，那末或許就要有燒燬之虞，要檢查短路，雖也不難，可是也夠麻煩。下面有一法，很便利（如圖三），只要用一隻電燈串連在變壓器的初級上，然後接到電源綫，如果燈像普通一樣明亮，（或許稍暗因綫圈也有相當阻力）那末就可知道內中綫圈已發生短路，假使電燈不過是暗紅，那就表示並沒有短路，所以要防意外損失，最好這樣一試。</p>

<h3>無綫電廣播事業在日本（續）</h3>
<p>— 蔡光華</p>
<p>聽衆</p>
<p>今日日本無綫電聽衆的數目，在世界上是居第五位（一美，二英。三德，四俄，五日），一九二六年九月，日本全國聽衆祇三四三一六六人，一九三三年三月，增加至一零五五七七八人，一九三四年一月，增加爲一六四四八三九人，不過，如果把這個數字，和日本全國人口的總數一比較，日本無綫電事業的分佈，是算不得普遍的，因爲平均聽衆總數，和人口總數的比例是二十五比一○○○，可是，單以大阪而論，因爲是工業區域的緣故，所以它的比率是千分之四四·一，雖東京那麼繁華的都市，也望塵莫及，那是例外，其他冷靜的村落裹，連無綫電收音機什麼樣子都不知道的人也有。</p>
<p>聽衆方面，每個月都應當付七十五錢（約洋七角五分）的收音費，所以，恊會方面，每月收音費的收入是很可觀的，在政府的要求之下，其中一部分的收入是用來預防肺勞病和其他各種有益社會人羣的設施。</p>
<p>收音機</p>
<p>在日本最普遍的收音機是小型的（Ｍidget　Type），外表和美國貨Ｅmerson差不多，可是，實際上機內的真空管，沒有美國貨都麼多，（技術及使用方面，當然也不及的），因爲日本國土不大，廣播事業有條例地連絡著，所以，並不需要長距離的收音機，普通收音機內真空管的數目，大約是從二個到四個，大都都是二二七，一一二Ａ。二四七，二四七Ｂ，二二四和二三五，一一二Ｂ整流管，在日本也很普遍，至於擴聲器呢，磁力的最普遍，可是，電動式的也不少，同時，旅行式的收音機，現在也逐漸時髦了，礦石機和直流收音機，也仍舊可以找到，不過在都市裹，交流電源的供給很完備，當然聽衆們都樂於使用交流式的了，表面上看來，似乎我的國無綫電事業，羅日本爲進步，美國流行的新式真空管，我國也流行，在日本卻並不見得普遍，可是，仔細一想，我國流行的東西，是不是我中華民國的國產，那是一個問題。（待續）</p>

<h3>玩具可以賣國</h3>
<p>— 乃常</p>
<p>游戲玩具雖然是一件小小的東西，但是小朋友們啊，你們不可太輕視它哩：你不見國際貿易局的報告麼；本年一月至八月，短短的八個月中，從外洋運入我國的游戲玩具，就已經值價六十六萬四千餘元了！</p>
<p>六十六萬四千餘元可真不是一個小數目，如果年年如此，可不是不上多少年，要把我們的金錢都流到外洋去嗎？這樣的看來，玩具真可以賣國哩！你們慣用游戲玩具的小月友們，正應該隨時檢點，看見已將要買的玩具是不是外洋貨？如果是外洋貨，便不應該買了！</p>
<p>因此，我們更明白了，無論什麼事，都應該從小處著眼，從小處做起啊！「哀莫大於心死」！小朋友，請你們留意留意！</p>
<h3>小先生制</h3>
<p>— 沈瘦若</p>
<p>江蘇省立俞塘民衆敎育館長鈕長耀先生，前天到我們南匯地方來視察民敎，召集各民敎館長談話會，鈕先生指示以後辦理民敎宜利用「小先生制」，以學校敎育來補助民衆敎育的發展，菌效當可增加云云。</p>
<p>按鈕先生所謂「小先生制，」就是利用有程度的學生，歸敎其家屬和親戚。這方法倒很有趣，如果，實行起來，可以「變以前」父敎其子兄勉其兄」的新調了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們如有做小先生的興趣的話，那末，應該節省打菱角和踢鍵子的游戲時間，加工的接受你們大先生的訓練，充實你們的常識。當起小先生的敎務來，才能勝任，而使你們的家長格外愛護啊。</p>
<h3>高爾基的童年生活</h3>
<p>— 士相</p>
<p>小朋友，大概你們都知道俄國革命文豪高爾基吧。他一生的偉大的事業，算是值得我們十二分佩服。但他這種偉大事業的基礎，就是在他童年時代養成的。</p>
<p>他自幼就沒有了爸爸，他跟著他的母親到外祖家裹去過活。母親待他並不好，倒是他的外祖母，很是愛憐他，他也很喜歡外祖母，因爲外祖母常常能夠講故事給他聽，又敎他識字的。</p>
<p>後來，高爾基給外祖父，送到一爿鞋店裹去做學徒。不多時，又換到一個書圖師那裹去做徒弟，他天天燒飯，洗碗，掃地，做著䇾多污穢的事情，一點沒有怨恨。可是他唯一癖氣，就是喜歡著小說：每晚上，終是瞞著人，偷偷的點著一盞油燈，縮在牀上看書，因此那個圖畫師的妻子，很是不滿意他。</p>
<p>高爾基從畫圖師那裹回來，就獨自跑到一隻輪船上去，當一個小火夫，和輪船上的茶房，水手，火夫，做好朋友。有空的時候，他就似量看些小說，聽講故事。</p>
<p>不久，高爾基又回到外祖母的家裹，可是外祖母家裹漸漸窮了，他的母親，也生病死了！高爾基就和他的外祖母，常常出去拾柴，拾垃圾，做賣買，過著乞丐的生活。…………</p>
<p>小朋友，高爾基的童年生活，多麼有趣，可惜我一時寫完全，不能多給你們知道。但是你們得明白，高爾基所以能夠成功一個大名鼎鼎的文學家，就因爲他不怕磨鍊，不怕吃苦，用功讀書，和多看小說的綠故啊！</p>
<h3>你牢記！</h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>小朋友，你牢記！</p>
<p>是誰慘殺了你的同胞？</p>
<p>是誰搶佔了你的土地？</p>
<p>是誰想滅你們的國家？</p>
<p>來呌你做他的奴隸！</p>
<p>小朋友，你牢記！</p>
<p>國仇不可不報！</p>
<p>從今朝起，</p>
<p>你便要努力去讀書，</p>
<p>也要鍜鍊好你的身體，</p>
<p>你要做金牌召不回的岳飛，</p>
<p>努力罷！你牢記！</p>
<h3>觔斗令</h3>
<p>— 竹</p>
<p>親愛的小朋，你覺得西遊記上的孫大聖——孫行者的觔斗雲法術偉太吧——他能一個觔斗，蹤去十萬八千里！現在我有一個「觔斗令」，一說出口，就可連環著到無限量，這樣不又比美猴王孫行者的斛斗雲，更神通廣大了嗎？看下去，你就可得到這法寶了。</p>
<p>我們揀兩個字，要它正倒讀來，都是共同一意義的，像「甜密」「爸媽」「好壞」「黑白」「上下」……等，我們若把它顛倒過來，成爲「密甜」「媽爸」「壞好」「白黑」「下上」……等，其原來意義，不是並沒絲毫變動嗎？就把這樣的兩個字，依照一正一倒的規律，每一次顛倒，添加一個字上去——意義仍須相同——如此連環的增添著，正倒著，你便會感到一種深的趣味，你有看下面的例：</p>
<p>甜密，密甜；甜甜密，密甜甜；甜甜蜜蜜，蜜蜜甜甜：甜甜蜜蜜，密密甜甜…………</p>
<p>照此說下去，正著倒著，增加著，以至無限量地正著倒著，增加著，直至你張口結舌的說不清楚。</p>
<p>我們杭州人，看見小孩子跌了斛斗，去扶他起來時，就說：「跌一交，杜（即大）一杜。」這斛斗令，正恰似這句話的意思呀！</p>
<p>親愛的小友，你來試試看，看你能一氣跌上幾個觔斗呢？能比孫行者的觔斗雲更偉大更神通嗎？</p>
<h3>我不要跟你握手啦！</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>一個問題</h3>
<p>— 一震</p>
<p>桂兒克兒和秀兒坐在一株大梧桐的蔭下，桂兒講著「兎和貓的故事」，克兒和秀兒聽得很高興：雖然講者的故事已完了，但是聽者的興致不以有盡，要求講者再講下去，桂兒的故事卻已沒有了。於是克兒和秀兒向桂兒吵鬧起來。</p>
<p>父親聽見了，跑出來說：「孩子們，不要吵，我來講，我來講個故事。」克兒和秀兒快樂地停止了吵鬧，靜默地待著父親講。父親坐在小籐椅上，咳了聲說：「我先提出個問題，你們能殻解答，我才講個故事。」</p>
<p>「好好，父親快些講！」三個人同聲說「有兩個父親和兩個兒子，到山林裹去打獵，結果，他們捕得三隻鹿，他們很平均地分開了他們的捕獲物，你們想，他們能不能平均地分配？」父親說。</p>
<p>克兒和秀兒都不能回答，桂兒卻不加思索地說：「這很容易，他們必定是一個祖父和他的兒子孫子，從家庭的稱呼上說，他們是兩個父親和兩個兒子，實際他們還是三個人。」</p>
<p>「對的，對的，聰明的孩子！」父親撫摸著桂兒的頭說：「我講個蜂蟻戰爭的故事給你們的聽吧。」</p>
<h3>勸小朋友勿吸香烟</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>在最近，我看見不少的小朋友歡哀吸香煙，往往將糖果錢節省下來，去買香煙吸，這實在是不應該的事。</p>
<p>香煙，是一種消費品，吸了不但沒有益處，而且還有害處，像容易引起火患：容易傷害腦力：容易妨害妨害咽喉，發生嗆咳等等；都是香煙的害處，就是成人且不應吸，何況尚未成年的人朋友呢？</p>
<p>在現在提倡新生活運動的時候，有幾個地方，像南京等處，都在禁止吸香煙。記得蔣委員長某次在路上看見有一個十歲的小朋友吸香煙，當時就要懲辦他的家長。於是嚇的那些大人們都禁止他的兒女吸香煙，以後某地就沒有這種舉動了！</p>
<p>我國的同胞，對於敎育上面，都不很注意，以爲兒童們吸一兩次香煙，沒有什麼關係，就放任他吸，但是久而久之，他們就非吸不可了！所以在他們第一次要吸的時候，就應當禁止他們。至於小朋友們自已，要應當覺司香煙不是兒童們所應吸的，來絕對的禁止，千萬不能以爲哀而有彩，就買了吸，要知道裹面的大將，是不容易得到的，何況吸煙的消費很大，就是得到大獎，也邇不合算呢？</p>
<h3>七巧板與新生活</h3>
<p>— 醒霞</p>
<h3>怎樣注意口齒的衛生</h3>
<p>— 日召</p>
<p>小朋友，牙齒是人生頂頂重要的一件工具，我們在吃食物的時候，所不能缺少的。所以我們要時常很小心謹慎地保重它。但是有一般小友們，常常忽略它，把那些有害於牙齒的糖果來亂吃，一點也不曉得愛護也；以致受到牙痛，脫牙，以及連事使腦筋繃痛。這是何等的愚蠢呵！</p>
<p>小朋友們，如果你們不願受到牙齒的痛苦，請你們把下面幾項稍爲留意一下。</p>
<p>（一）每次吃過飯餐後，必須漱口一次。假使用硼砂水含漱一二分鐘，那麼一定非常潔凈美觀哩。</p>
<p>（二）我們所用的牙刷毛，不可太硬，因爲太硬是容易剌破牙肉面湧出血來的。</p>
<p>（三）牙血如果出個不住，我們可以把胎髪燒灰存性，敷在患處，便會好的。</p>
<p>（四）每天晚上臨睡時，用鹽刷牙一次，將口中污物去凈。睡覺後，口中無惡氣薰蒸，自然少受牙患了。</p>
<p>（五）口臭是一種討厭的毛病，我們只要在睡覺前口內含一枚荔子肉，到了一天醒後吐掉，照行十天見效。</p>
<p>（六）最後我們所要顧到的，無論是冬天或夏天，漱嘴的水。不可過冷過熱。否則很容易剌澈牙齒出血，漸漸地使牙齒活動而脫落，便變了個老太婆啦！</p>
<h3>小笑話</h3>
<p>— 承昭</p>
<p>（一）騙騙小孩子的</p>
<p>二房東姆媽拿著兩包糖果來，送給敏兒，伊說；「嫂嫂，這一點點東西是騙騙小孩小的：敏兒，你拿了罷！」</p>
<p>敏兒很不快樂的說：「媽，我不要我一定不要它。」</p>
<p>二房東驚奇地問他道；「敏兒，你爲什麼不要呢？敏兒答道：「因爲你要騙我，決非好意。」</p>
<p>（二）多放一天啦！</p>
<p>敏兒是個貪無的孩子，當先生在發國慶紀念日的放假條子時，他要二張。先生覺得很奇怪便向他說：「敏兒，你要多一張有什麼用呢？」</p>
<p>敏兒回答說：「先生，多要一張，就可多放一天啦」</p>
<p>（三）貪心的敏兒。</p>
<p>先生在算術課上的問道：「什麼呌做十分之一？」學生們都回答不出來。先生於是微笑地說：「我來比方給你們聽，如果給你們十個人一個蘋果，你們怎樣分呢？」</p>
<p>敏兒從最後一排起立說：「照我的法子，等其他九個人回家後，我一個人吃好了。」</p>
<h3>小朋友們的信條</h3>
<p>— 醒生</p>
<p>（一）早起早眠。</p>
<p>（二）身體要清潔，衣服要整齊。</p>
<p>（三）飮食要有規定的時間和分量，不吃零食。</p>
<p>（四）說話要誠實，清楚，不知道的事情不瞎說。</p>
<p>（五）不得人家的許可，不拿人家的東西。</p>
<p>（六）自已所能做的事情，不靠別人。</p>
<p>（七）不買外國貨。</p>
<p>（八）不浪費金錢，時間和用品。</p>
<p>（九）要孝順父母，敬重師長，愛護友朋。</p>
<p>（十）自已做錯了事要承認，並急速改進。</p>
<p>（十一）不說自已的好處，不談別人的壞處。</p>
<p>（十二）人家欺我，要用正當的方法去對付。</p>
<p>（十三）勤看有益的圖書。</p>
<h3>落棄何以會變黃色？</h3>
<p>— 苦</p>
<p>大凡一種植物的葉，生在樹枝上，本來多是綠色的，等到快要和枝幹分別的時候，就變成黃色，看著似乎很奇異，我們要曉得葉上的綠色，就是葉子裹有一種葉縁素的緣故。之種葉綠素，是靠著太陽光的力和吸收的炭氣而成的。葉子離去枝幹，就失去這機能，不會吸炭氣，因此也就不能製造葉綠素。原有的葉綠素蒸發去了，祇剩下慘淡枯瘦的黃色了。</p>
<h3>農村小友的通問</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>秋深了</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>秋深了，桂花的香味，和我們告別：什麼花兒，都回家去了。</p>
<p>那末，這自然的世界，枯寂了嗎？上天之造物，決不使人感著單調的。看啊！械樹的葉片，由綠的變成紅了：在風浪裹飄舞著，好像成千累萬的蝴蝶會。夠多麼玩味！</p>
<p>小朋友：知道紅葉的成因嗎？拿一張葉片用顯微鏡看察它的切斷面，就可看得出表皮和葉肉組織的一部，細胞液內，含著紅顏色的液體。這紅色液體是一種花青素，加了稀薄的鹽酸，就變成鮮美的紅色。如果注射鹼質液，仍變成綠色。都是花青素的反應的原故。再將它放在熱水裹，（葉片變成綠色葉綠素不易溶於水中）水就成功通紅的了。</p>
<p>東籬之菊，傲然吐芳：替枯寂的花世界，生色不少！黃的似金，白的像銀，紅的，紫的，都鮮艷奪目！那些花瓣兒，像針的，像朧爪的，牡丹形的也有，龍角形的也有。美麗的花朶，儘自賞個飽。</p>
<p>天氣漸漸地涼了，冷了，望諸位小朋友珍重！</p>
<h3>全世界的小朋友</h3>
<p>— 文譽揚</p>
<p>（一）西班牙的小孩，常常穿了花花綠綠的衣服，手裹執著皮鼓跳舞。這是他們日常的遊戲。我們不時在戲院子裹可以看得見他們那種別有風味的西班牙土風舞。</p>
<p>（二）埃及的古蹟，最有名的是金字塔。小朋友們一定知道的。你看他們那裹小朋友的裝束，多麼奇怪啊！好像我們在圖書畫上看見的古裝一樣。</p>
<p>（三）馬來小孩住在熱帶裹，他們的裝束和我們鄉村裹的小朋友差不多，但是形狀卻完全不像，皮膚是棕色的，又喜歡吃椰子。</p>
<p>（四）我們西南地方，像廣西貴州那裹有種苗民，他們的生活遠和初民一樣的野蠻。那裹的小朋友，常常喜穿紅紅綠綠的衣服，成羣的唱歌跳舞。</p>

<h3>刑法上的墮胎問題</h3>
<p>— 羣慧</p>
<p>墮胎原是和其他一切反社會的行爲一樣，在不健全的社會制度底下必必然發生的———然而是特殊的——現象。婦女懷胎而生育，是極其自然的，假使沒有無理逼迫的社會的原因，決不會發生這一反社會反自然的墮胎行爲，這是很顯然的道理。</p>
<p>法律也就不外是講道理的東西，可是·立法者對於某一犯罪行爲·往往忽視其社會的原因，祇要去處理其原因所迫成的結果·這正如把石頭壓住潛滋暗長的草根一樣，是沒有效果的。現在歐美各國——除蘇聯外——都以墮胎爲犯罪行爲而嚴禁之，但墮胎者乃至墮胎業者都有增無減，終而至於禁不勝禁。</p>
<p>最近，立法院在制定我國刑法，墮胎問題自然提到刑法上來了。立法院委員諸公，在刑法中·照例設定『第二十四章，墮胎罪』，特制定如下的刑律：</p>
<p>『第二八三條·（一）懷胎婦女服藥或以他法墮胎者處六月以下有期徒刑，拘役，或一百元以下罰金。』（二）懷胎婦女聽從他人墮胎者亦同』</p>
<p>就這條法律看來，懷胎婦女縱有如何重大的理由，都不準有墮胎的行爲，即使婦女因生育而有性命之虞也不得墮胎。這簡直把婦女當作一種『會生孩子的機器』，絲毫不曾認定婦女的人的權利。生育對於社會，固然是重要，但婦女自身的生存更爲重要。換言之，婦女是有獨立人格的「人」，決不能爲著生育而犧牲自已，在迫不得已的社會的原因之下，墮胎決不能認爲犯罪的行爲。至少在所謂文明世紀的現代，這樣不合理的法律條文，根本沒有存在的價值。無怪乎在立法院委員中也有人提出反對意見了。</p>
<p>王崑崙先生對這條文的意見是很正確的。他說：「（一）懷胎婦女因病應準墮胎，（二）因經濟困難亦可墮胎，因無力養育之家庭所生子女營養不足，生而不養養而不發，有背繁殖民族之意，吾人主張繁殖人口，不主全國是病夫或無敎育之人」。這雖然並不曾站在婦女權利的立塲，而是站在所謂『繁殖民族』的見地而說的話，但他至少把握到所以要墮胎的社會的原因。</p>
<p>可是，焦亦堂先生卻來『主張維持原案』，其理由是「墮胎有乖風俗，爲維持公益，應嚴格限制」（詳見十月二十七日中央社關於立法院刑法修正案的電文）。焦先生是站在所謂「風俗」和所謂「公益」的見地，而要「嚴格限制」墮胎。</p>
<p>然而，這所謂風俗是什麼東西呢？在中國目前流行著的「風俗」，尤其是關於男女關係上的風俗，都不就是封建的大家旗主義所釀造出來的「重男輕女」，「三從四德」一類的東西嗎？我們雖然打倒了滿清，但滿清時代的風俗還是保存著，正因爲保存這種最惡的風俗，所以會發生墮胎一類的反自然的事實，這點是焦先生們無法理解的。至於所謂「公益」，更是抽象的空洞的論據，墮胎到底是有害於男子的「公益」還是婦女的「公益」？婦女因著不能生育的種種社會的原因，取出自已肚子裹的血肉來，這是不得已的具體的事實，而且是婦女處置自身的正當權利，決不能拿男權社會的所謂「公益」來張制婦女生育的。</p>
<p>通常，法律是以所謂「民族繁殖」或「國家強盛」爲最大前提。在這大前提之下，獎勵生育乃至強制生育，各國都有其例。歐戰後，歐洲諸國都有過獎勵生育或強制結婚之舉，尤其在最近法西主義所統治的意德，特別顯著的實行這種政策。在這些國家，墮胎當然在嚴禁之列，可是他們也不偏面的禁止，即另一面特設母性保護制，生育獎勵金（如意大利），或由國家保障生育婦女或其丈夫的職業（如德國），可是，在我們中國，無論都市或農村，大多數婦女經常的處於失業狀態，生活根本不得安定，而國家也沒有去保障生育婦女的經濟生活，結果·大多數貧窮家庭，迫得「生而不養，養而不發」，甚至出於賣子鬻女，這些都是不可掩的現實的事實。因此，國家在用法律禁止墮胎以前，至少須有如下的防止墮胎的方策：</p>
<p>（一）保障生育婦女的經濟生活的安定。</p>
<p>（二）保護母性，即認定母性的社會的特殊權利。</p>
<p>（三）對於生育子女，國家負敎養的責任。</p>
<p>（四）廢除私生子制度。</p>
<p>關於墮胎的動機，茲九先生在本刋第三十一期發表的『墮胎』一文中，舉出如下四種：『（一）困於經濟無力敎養，（二）熱心事業，藉此得節少育兒之煩，（三）身體孱弱，不堪大產，（四）失身懷孕，怕受社會之誹謗，或無人負育兒之責等』，這些動機都是客觀的社會環境所造成的不得已的事實，決不是婦女自身的主觀的願望。因此，在未完全解除其社會的原因以前，法律雖如何依據焦亦堂先生的意見而「嚴格限制」墮胎，但終於敵不退現實的社會事情的逼迫，「偷偷摸摸」也要去墮胎，結果，法律不單成爲一紙空文，更因而在社會上百病叢生，無法醫治。</p>
<p>我們曉得，現在蘇聯的婦女們，有墮胎的自由，並且有安全墮胎的公設機關，但除了極少數因特殊原因——例如有傳染性的或害及母性的疾病或職務關係——而墜胎者外，大多數婦女都喜歡生孩子，這原因，第一，懷胎婦女受國家的特別保護，第二，對產兒，國家負敎養之責，第三，無所謂私生子的差別待遇，因此，她們不單不願意墜胎，反而更希望多生幾個孩子。</p>
<p>要之，與其以法律限制墜胎，不如先謀消滅，驅迫婦女去墜胎的社會的原因更來得確當！</p>
<h3>娼妓是怎樣產生的？</h3>
<p>— 鐵鳴</p>
<p>什麼「人道主義」，在資本主義現社會裹，機本是不會有的。且看禁娼，廢妓的呼聲，不知高喊了多少時候，不但沒有一點實效，反而娼妓一天多似一天。</p>
<p>最近工部局捕房的拘捕娼妓，同樣的，不但不能防止娼寮或減少娼妓，亦沒有能力解瘊娼妓的生活問題，</p>
<p>我們在每天黃昏以後，在熱鬧的街旁或冷靜的巷口，可以看見一羣羣未成年的雉妓，裝嬌作羞地引誘行人，任思淫的男子挑擇。天韻樓，樂圈，……都好像是「人肉市塲」似的，充滿了慘紅悽緣的許多娼妓，雖說她們比站在街頭的雉妓較高等，其實，她們的痛苦並沒有兩楊。</p>
<p>婦女們是本心願意去當娼妓嗎？娼妓是怎樣的產生？這些這些，對於社會問題有了認識的人。是很明白的。</p>
<p>娼妓的產生，有兩個條件：（一）容貌條件—社會需要娼妓；（二）主觀條件—婦女爲解決生活問題，去當娼妓。在病態的現社會裹，具備了這兩個條件，所以社會產生了許多娼寮，和出賣肉體的娼妓。</p>
<p>我們先說誴會爲什麼需要娼妓呢？進是容貌的社會問題。這問題若詳細研究起來，不是寥寥數語可以說清楚的，這裹爲便利研究起見，祇簡單地舉述如次：</p>
<p>（一）因爲廣大的勞苦羣衆，受到物質條件的限制，娶不起老婆；但是他們和平常人一樣，都有生理的要求，需要性的解決，沒有辦法，所以常常宿娼。</p>
<p>（二）有錢的資本家，過不慣一夫一妻和平板的生活，然而他們又戴著假面具，不願納妾，爲追求性慾的滿足計，祇有宿娼。</p>
<p>（三）一部分的官僚政客們，擁妻抱妾的生活已感到厭倦，可是狂暴的獸慾又無從消洩，爲了想尋求一點新的享受，所以朝秦暮楚地去宿娼</p>
<p>（四）還有些流浪人，他們因爲金錢的驅使，離開家庭，別了妻子，漂流異鄉。日子久了，抑厭不住他們的性的衝動，只有去宿娼。</p>
<p>（五）也有一些不滿意自已婚姻的青年，因家庭或社會的種種關係，沒有法子擺脫，精神上受了重大的刺激，所以實行消極的抵抗，以宿娼滿足他們的性慾要求。</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>社會需要娼妓的條件，不是十分明顯了嗎？那麼，讓我們再說婦女怎會去當娼妓？這事實也很明白地擺在我們的眼前了。</p>
<p>在這男權中心的現社會裹，一切的生產機關都爲男子所佔有，婦女成了男子的附屬品—或是財產的一部。她們被男子玩弄，供男子開心，纔能獲得生活資料。既然如此，但現代中國（世界也是這樣）多數的男子，都娶不起妻子，自然形成了婦女過剩的現象。婦女在社會上既沒有經濟地位，又沒有特殊的生產技能，但她們的肚子也和男子的一樣，時常會肚餓的；忍不住饑餓的威迫，祇有賣肉體而爲娼妓。</p>
<p>而且，中國年年天災人禍，和農村經濟總破產的結果，使得都市衰落，工商凋敝。失業人數一天多一天，婦女普遍的找不著職業，是現社會的特微。爲了生活的驅迫，她們還顧到所謂「禮義廉恥」嗎？這是主觀的條件，並不是她們言心目願去幹這勾當。</p>
<p>所以，想　　　　，禁廢娼妓，必定要求婦女在社會經濟上，佔有相當的地位—能找到相當的職業。想婦女能找到職業，必定要求婦女的解放；婦女想求到自由的解放，誠如前期姚斐羣所謂必需先將現社會有所改革。換句話說，防止娼寮和禁娼，祇有設法解決娼妓存在的主觀客觀條件，否則娼妓只是一天多一天，永遠沒有消滅的可能。</p>

<h3>關於同性愛</h3>
<p>— 友白</p>
<p>所謂同性愛本不限於婦女之間，且不僅發生於現代。當羅馬文明全盛時代，曾一度盛行；希臘文明策源地，小亞細亞的萊斯樸斯島，更風靡一時。這島裹曾出過不少的文學者和哲學者，其中特別有名的，就是女文學家莎芙渥，她曾詳述同性愛，並加以鼓吹，遂使同性愛的惡風彌漫全島。</p>
<p>這種變態的戀愛現象，在中世紀的尼院裹，時有發生，他們的曖昧生活，在文學上常有詳述，惡風流佈於世界，實非吾人想像所能及。</p>
<p>巴黎耽於此惡習者，爲數頗多，有專爲同性愛而設的俱樂部，是一種有組織的東西。但頗注意消潔及衛生，故社會並不視爲罪惡。</p>
<p>近年來這種惡風很快的輸入了中國和日本，凡是女性集居的塲所，關於同性愛的事件，時有所聞。例如女學校高級生對於漂亮的下級生加以愛撫，女敎師對於可愛的學生特別注意，某生熱烈地愛慕某銜生等事實，在任何學校中可以找得出的。寄宿舍女工塲公庽等處，往往以老處女或寡婦等充任監督，他們最重大的任務，就是警戒被監督者與異性交際，被監督者在他們恐怖的目光和高壓的手腕之下，只有服從命令，恪守規則；但是女子們達到一定的年齡，體內的生殖腺旺盛，自然流露出愛的要求。最初只是一種同性間的友愛，漸漸很自然的會趨於異性愛，但是他們和異性之間，被隔著一條長堤，於是他們只能求愛情於同性者，到了熱烈的程度，就非滿足接觸慾不可了。</p>
<p>同性愛的結果，不但使身體精神發生病態，且因此不能營異性間正常的結婚生活，當同性愛發生阻礙時，也和異性間失戀一樣要自殺妬殺或情死，幾年前閧動一時的陶劉慘殺案，不就是一個最顯著的妬殺例子麼。雖然案情是非常複雜的，但一般人都說是同性戀愛的結果。</p>
<p>同性愛既是戕賊女性的惡習，凡女性集居的塲所，應作公開的演講或討論，使未染惡習的，明其害，防患於未然，染之而程度尚輕的，應導之使入於異性愛的正軋，至於已呈病態的，則非從速就醫不可，願負訓育監督之責者注意及之。</p>
<h3>雜感</h3>
<p>— 姚斐</p>
<p>最近立法院修改刑法，關於婦女的有兩種妙論而竟都能聳動會塲：一則是把姦淫未滿十六歲之女子，以強姦論，減低兩歲，改爲未滿十四歲，其理由是照著古訓：「女子十四而天癸至」，認爲天發一至，女子就算成熟了，其次，是預防女子利用年齡敲淫棍們的竹槓。一般女子，是不是到了十四歲都已性的成熟，這且不說，即便真的成熟，然成熟總不等於發育完全吧！立法委員們，對於女子的生理健康絕不注意，卻爲預防淫棍們之被敲竹槓，將十六歲改爲十四歲！這種擁護男子—（淫蕩的男子）利益的精神真算不錯—另外一則是某委員對於「女子和誘有婦之夫」處刑的大道理：他說「最近常有貪利之徒，把女兒嫁給要人作妾，而女子亦有貪利之徒，把女兒嫁給要人作妾，而女子亦有貪慕虛榮而甘爲人妾者，但此種受過敎育的女子，固決不作妾，勢必將其正室擇出以圖鵲巢鳩佔云，」這位委員首先把「取妾弄小老婆的是男子」這一前題忘了，於是說起來似乎振振有詞，然而爲何要鵲巢鳩佔呢？也顯然是不能自圓其說！在我們看來，和誘的責任以及納妾等等這些責任，實在都應由男子負的，譬如曾經轟動一時的「辜李案」吧：究竟是李之甘願作妾呢？還是辜之騙婚呢？利用地位金錢誘騙女性的男子，從來都與辜某如出一轍的，然而立法委員們爲盡其擁護男權的任務，對於婦女的罪名，總是歪曲妄加的。</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>婦女運動，久已夫消聲匿跡了。不料近來上海市一再有婦女團體出現，這現象總算很好的，可是婦運最大廠結，在家庭與育兒，對於這個不謀根本解決，心再熱，意再誠，一切都是白費的。此外，一種運動，當然是爲多數，不是爲少數，尤其不是爲個人，然而回顧以前，我們看見的只是少數得勢，個人成名，大衆還是原來受苦受難的大衆！現在時賢，當然不比過去的老朽了。提醒是應該提醒的，還有，中國男權有些大得近於野蠶，男子自私的心理，總思想前進的人，有時也免不了，一般人食肉的傢伙，更不堪聞問，所以主持女運的人，必須把握住男女絕對平等的原則，爭取婦女自身利益（實際也是就是整個人類的利益）遇事萬不要不去深思明辦，感情用事，甚至做起來等於枷鎖鐐銬了自已—要知道，口頭扶助婦女權益的，實際或者就是阻礙者，這是不能不予以深切注意的，看來中國婦女運動像是又在抬頭了，敢進諍言如此。</p>

<h3>經濟獨立是性的先決條件</h3>
<p>— 洪華</p>
<p>爲甚麼，「性」的先決條件是經濟獨立？</p>
<p>在婦女，奴隸般的被壓迫著，無論在生活上，地位上，都當作「非人的」，當作劣于男子，一切在男子支配底下存續的活著到現在，難遵這是不可理解的謎嗎？</p>
<p>這，不能不使我們，有回顧而考察著歷史之必要。</p>
<p>在上古，生活資料的生產，還只爲滿足極單純的需要而已的時代，男女的能力，在本質上是一樣的。那時候，他們平等的共同勞動，共同的享受生活的愉快。戰門中，婦女和男子一樣的男敢作戰；她們能夠和男子一樣的負重，從事于劇烈的勞動，而她們卻生活的很幸福；她們的體格很強壯，並且容貌非常漂亮。</p>
<p>那時候的婦女，是以一個動物的人類，沒有剝削和壓迨，而健康的，䇄然與自然奮門著，生活著的。</p>
<p>然而，生產方法和生產物分配方法的變遷，這影響于兩性間的關係——婦女就在「奴隸」這種人類未曾存在之先，就最先做奴隸的人類了。</p>
<p>漁牧農耕等等生活的進步，所給與人類的努力，是各種特別知識之要求，和工具之製造與使用：就在這種社會發展的過程中，生產工具，大都爲男子所佔領，使男子成了富源的主人翁。「財產私有」制，在這個時候建立了牠的緊固的基礎和私有財產制成立同時，婦女就成爲男人的隸屬。</p>
<p>私有財產制最初的表徵，是壓制婦女，——妻子是被禁止和別的男子交際；同時，男子有蓄妾權利：兒子成了私有財產的承繼者：女兒從哇哇墮地的時候起，便在不平等的待遇中生和息，家庭不過是女兒們的貞操監牢，一直價賣她到另一個鐵鍊的縛束中——她的丈夫手裹爲止。</p>
<p>這悲哀的生存呵！聽吧，我們的詩人，如何表現當時婦女的地位的：</p>
<p>「一切有精神和肉體的之內，</p>
<p>呵—最可哀的存在，實在是我們女子！</p>
<p>我們非帶了嫁妝賣給丈夫不可——最恨的是我們的身體也得歸他了。</p>
<p>不論他是怎樣的人，善人或惡人。</p>
<p>這種危險最足驚人，—因爲離婚是女人的侮辱，而且女人是不許拒絕她的丈夫的。</p>
<p>女人現在聽從不悔的新法，非推測丈夫的性質不可，—因爲誰都不告訴她的。</p>
<p>假使我們能遠到一切，很歡喜的和愛人同居。</p>
<p>這是我們所最羨仰的時候。</p>
<p>但是，假使不然，還不如死了的好！</p>
<p>男人的可以避去家裹的煩惱，在外面，可以尋到能夠安慰他的。</p>
<p>在朋友之旁，在同輩之列，—而我們則非孤寂的守在家裹不可！</p>
<p>他們當說，女人毫沒危險的。</p>
<p>當他們戰爭的時季，住在家裹。</p>
<p>好愚的誕見！我情願上三次戰塲，不願經一次的產得！」</p>
<p>這種悲慘的，非人的性之隸屬的生活，全人類的婦女是一例的遭受了這種不幸。一她們是爲狹小範圍的家庭而生存，是產生兒女的機器，是家庭的管理者，是丈夫的奴婢。就在這種經濟組織之私有財產的基石上，法律規定婦女的生命與自由，是償付對於丈夫犯了過失的抵擺；宗敎幫助支配者創造了神的旨意，給她們以極端的侮辱，企圖在命運論的煙幕裹，消滅她們對現實不滿的反叛；偏頗的敎育給與婦女的，是溫柔馴服爲女性至高的德行。這種種壓迫婦女的工具，造就了她們柔懦頑劣的特性，對自已人生意義的認識，到幾千年過來的今日，大多數的婦女，還幾乎看成這是自然的應該。</p>
<p>婦女爲甚麼必得隸屬於男子？非隸屬於男子便不能活嗎？真的，這隸屬是自然的應該囑？當然，這是由於遣傳習慣和敎養所保留的觀念，是社會關係的壓迫所得的結果！這結果，是起於被壓迫者的婦女，對壓迫者的男人的「經濟從屬」的原故。—這是歷史所明白告訴於我們的，以一個動物的人類而幸福生活的婦女，貶爲不堪的奴隸地位者，完全由於財產私有這個制度，婦女處於一「經濟從屬」的地位而形成的。</p>
<p>「性」的光決條件，是一「經濟獨立」，這是天經地義的真理吧。</p>
<p>因爲，組濟組織，雖由封建轉變到資本主義，社會已經經過了劇烈的變革吧，但財產制度之私有，並不兩樣，而且更深刻了；婦女之仍啤吟於從屬的壓迫底下，是必然的事情。</p>
<p>我們不能否認，婦女在社會進化的過程中，完全沒有解放的變動，也不能不承認，資本主義之興起，對於封建制度之下的人類，尤其是婦女，曾有相當的貢獻的這史實。然而，對於財產私有制所結與婦女的桎梏，永遠要爲婦女所咀咒，所反抗的目標，這是「絕對底」的吧。（未完）</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>語言與思想</h3>
<p>— 雉羽</p>
<p>托爾期泰在其「藝術論」中說：「語言能傳達人的意思和經騐·所以能爲人類聯合的法則，藝術也是如此。這種交際的法則所以和言語不同的地方，就是人用言語能傳達自已的「意思」於他人，用藝術則能傳達自已的「情感」於他人。……」把「意思」與「情感」對立起來，並依此而表明語言與藝術的差異，這當然是托爾斯泰的錯誤；但他之以爲語言是傳達人的思想的工具，這在某一點上說來，卻是正確的。</p>
<p>人類在其社會的生活過程中，由於一切事物之不斷地對他們腦筋的剌激，才形成其一定的思想。但此患想乃是潛伏於其腦筋中的，要把牠表白出來，便非要語言的工具不可：語言是表白思想，傳達思想的工具。</p>
<p>誰都知道，嘴與手不能反映客觀事物而形成一定的觀念，只有腦筋才能反映客觀事物，構成人類的思想。如果人類沒有特殊的腦筋，便不會有思想，因而也就不會有表白思想，傳達思想的語言：語言是由思想的存在而存在的，世間決不會有無思想的語言。</p>
<p>因爲語言要依存於思想，所以語言的發展也隨思想的發展而發展。很顯然的，在封建社會中，人類的思想內容是所謂羣貴民賤，敬神信鬼，重農輕商，是所謂權威主義，命運決定論，……等等，因而那時人類的語言便只能表白這些，不能講什麼科學民主，也不能講什麼自由競爭個人主義，在那時人類的語言中可以說連這類名詞都沒有：一定要到了近代社會，一定要在社會的發展中有了資本，機械，工廠，火車，輪船，飛機，……等等的存生，人類才會有關於這些的思想，所謂科學民主，所謂自由競爭個人主義等思想才會在人類的腦筯中存在，因而在人類的語言中才會有這些名詞與夫表白其一切關係的詞句。——這便是語言的發展是隨著思想的發展而發展的例證。</p>
<p>但是，語言這工具，無論是聲音的或文字的工具，都是人類在思考時用以表明事物之個性和其關係的特定性的不可缺少的東西。如果沒有語言的符號，沒有確定事物的名詞和表明其一切的詞句，那人類是不能思考的，也不能構成什麼思想形態的。譬如地球的概念雖在思考中是一種概念，但這概念仍是以聲音的或文字的符號來代表的，如果沒有這符號，那我們對此的思考便就無法進行。因此，語言在思想中所起的作用非常重大，其對於思想之重要，正如思想對於牠——語言之重要一樣。如果說沒有思想便沒有語言，那也可以說沒有語言的符號思想也是無法構成的。而且，我們可以說，思想是潛伏著的語言，語言則是以聲音或文字的符號表白出思想。在這點上，牠們兩者是相互依附著的。</p>
<p>固然，我們也可以說，在人類的勞動生活過程中，思想是發生在語言之先。不能說話的孩子，沒有語言的動物，牠們的腦筯中都有思想的萌芽，牠們的感官也能對於外物發生某種感覺，因而也能有對這外物的某種認識和想像。但是，無論如何，這是非常幼稚，非常簡單的，是沒有抽象性和帶著推理作用的，只是過是對外物的本色的一種簡單印象而已。拉發格在其「經濟決定論」中說：「當小孩子說本偶人時，他不能了解說任何樣的本偶人，而只說某種的木偶人，即他曾拿在他手中的或是大人已經指示給他過的。假使人們給他拿出別的一個來，他甚至會帶怒氣地推開不要。」爲什麼呢？因爲小孩子沒有抽象的推理的思維，他對外物只有簡單的本色的印象，所以他以爲木偶人只是指著他所看到的與拿在手中的那個木偶人而說的，別的他就想不到了。此外，如動物乃至野蠻人的思想都不發展，都不及文明化了的成年人的萬分之一，這就是因爲文明人的語言發達所使然的。因爲要有發達的語言的符號，才能進行更高的思考，要有完善的語言的工具，人類的思想才能很便利地傳達，人類的知識才能好好地遺傳下去，因而人類的思想才能日益豐富，日益發展。所以拉發格又說：「在實際上，最抽象的頭腦，不用字，不自言自語於內心，也就不能思維。縱使其用字，自言自語，不像小孩子口頭上那樣喧嘩不已，然而卻有許多成年人喃喃自語地說他所思維的東西。語言在智識的發展上，佔了一個很大的位置。」</p>
<p>總之，語言與思想是有密切關係的，牠們相互依附著：沒有思想，便不能發生語言，沒有語言的工具，也不能進行思考，構成思想；語言是隨思想的發展而發展，而思想的發展亦必有賴於語言這工具的推進；最後說來，牠們兩者實在是一個東西的兩種形態：「思維是無聲的語言」（馬克士米勒），語言是有聲或形的思維。</p>
<p>各業調查</p>
<h3>介紹所</h3>
<p>— 任重</p>
<p>在經濟衰落，農村破產，失業的癥候一天天地加重的今日，介紹所的確要算是一般沒有權貴可攀的失業者的一顆救星。這種介紹所在美國最爲普遍，現在上海也有了類似的介紹所出現，不過因爲介紹的範圍太狹，一般的職業份子還是得不到什麼幫助。這種介紹所，在現社會的階段，雖是一種重要的產物，可是它不能爲太多數的失業份子開闢廣大的生活之路，總覺有點美中不足。</p>
<p>在這裹我所要說的祇是「洋務介紹所」的內容。這種介紹所在上海現在有二十一家，主持的人大半都是白俄；他的因爲在上海住了了很久，對於各國僑民的家庭情形舊有相當的熟悉，所以就有不少的僱主都來找他們介紹。起幹這種介紹工作的白俄，大都祇重精神而沒有形式：後來，找他們僱人和請求被僱的人逐漸增多起來，便形成了都市中一種特殊的產物。</p>
<p>這種介紹所要算法租界一帶最多，其次，西摩路和北四川路也有幾家設立；每天到介紹所去請求介紹的人，一家至少在一百人以上。</p>
<p>這種「洋務職業介紹所」所介紹的範圍，僅限於洋務方面，大概分爲下面幾種：一，西崽，二，大司務，三，出店，這是屬於男子的三種。此外屬們女子的有兩種：一，阿媽，二，下手阿媽。</p>
<p>一個西崽的工資至多賺二十八元，他所擔任的職務是管理主人的飮食、服裝和收拾房間。有時還替主人管理銀錢的出納；不過西崽要想做到這種地步，至少要有三五年以上的歷史。大司務的職務等於中國的廚子，他除了烹調飮食之外，什麼都可以不遇問的，主人也不會勒令他多做職務以外的事。</p>
<p>一個大司務的工資和西崽的工資並不相上下，不過由於他經手備辦的菜蔬，另外卻不有一筆五匣傭金的「外快」收入：這種「外快」已經成了公開的秘密，就是東家自已經手，這筆傭金也仍舊可以拿到，「蔬菜店」對於這種沒有條文的密約，是絕對遵守奉行的。出店的工資就差的太遠了，一月至多不會超過十六元，擔任的職務也非常的繁雜，一天到晚都沒有閒餘的時間，這是一種所謂「著力不賺錢」的苦差。原因是做出店的多半不會講幾句英語，所以祇好做下層的工作。三種人中間工作最久的也要算是出店了，從早晨五點鐘起身，就要燒煤爐子，洗地板，拭玻璃，揩房間，這樣直到晚上，又要替男女主人擦皮鞋油，這些工作都是出店獨自擔任的。出店在賺月薪之外，也沒有點「外快」的收入，這種收入換句話說就是「揩油」：譬如替主人買皮鞋油，拭玻璃粉和擦銅油，這一些零星東西，都是他收入的對象了。</p>
<p>阿媽做的是男子所不能做的工作，她們多半是接近女主人：譬如領小孩子，侍候女主人洗浴，洗衣服和熨衣服，這都是男子所不便擔任的。她們的工資祇有廿五元，有時或許還會超過西崽的二資，不過這只有在某種特殊情形之下才會這樣。下手阿媽也是不會說英語的，最多的工資祇有十二元的數目：照普通的準則說起來，下手阿媽該賺十五元，不過有三元大多數都是給上手阿媽拿去了，這就是因爲下手阿媽不懂英語，所以祇好被剝掉三元的收入。下手阿媽的職務是專洗衣服，有時還兼代熨衣的工作：假如上手阿媽得主人的信仰的話，下手阿媽爲了生活的保障，還得替上手阿媽做許多私人的事務。</p>
<p>他們的工作看來都不怎樣繁重，可是同時也就沒有什麼保障：往往有在一個僱主那裹只做一天兩天就被辭掉的，那是極其平常的一件事情。由於這個原因，所以，一般介紹所雖然祇限於「洋務」一方面，而牠們卻仍能單獨的發展下去。</p>
<p>一個幹「洋務」職業的人，祇要他沒有犯過偷盜的行爲，他找第二次職業倒並不怎樣爲難的。當你到介紹所去登記時，依砥問你以前在什麼地方工作，主人的姓氏，和問你要一張你自已的照片</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>，這種初步的手續就算完成了。此外介紹費的抽取，也有一定的規則：自二十元至三十元的「生意」，收一元二角；三十元以外的收二元四角；最低的如下手阿媽這一種，祇收六角。這名爲手續費。手續費都是一律先付，一點也沒有情面給你拖延一天或兩天。至於「生意」能不能成功，介紹所卻是不負責的。</p>
<p>僱主到介紹紹要人，祇要留下一個通訊地址，和說明需要那一種職務的人就行：有時人不來，祇用電話通知一聲，介紹所馬上就會給你介紹一個人去。對於僱主的收費，都是一律一元。</p>
<p>介紹所對於請求介紹的人有自由支配的權力：在他的章程上雖訂有先後的次序，可是有一種老於跑介紹所的人竟有方法破壞他的章程。這就是說，除規定的介紹費之外，另送額外的報酬：假如發現了工資比較大的「生意」，那毫無疑問地是給這種願額外給報酬的人去做了。</p>
<p>言論</p>
<h3>跪哭團的發現與國貨前途</h3>
<p>— 致遠</p>
<p>在不久以前的報上，我們除描睦到許多日常慣見的政治，外交，軍事，以及奸淫槍殺的新聞之外，還看到下列的兩則新聞：一爲跪哭團的發現：一爲五馬路悅來南貨號的被炸。</p>
<p>關於跪哭團的行動和轟炸悅來的詳情，各報都有很詳細的紀載，這裹可不用我再來贅述。我們所不能已於言者；即這兩事，竟會發現在同時同地的上海，這卻使我們不能認爲是椿普通的社會新聞而把它忽略過去：這兩種事實的發現，雖則不能盡得一般人的同情，然而它含有民族意義的價值，總是值得我們的景仰的。</p>
<p>跪哭團過去曾在平津一帶嶄露頭角，在上海卻還是創見：但悅來被炸這類的事實，已經是數見不鮮的了。關於前者是採取消極的哀懇，後者則趨於暴烈的制裁：方式雖各有不同，可是它最後的目的，卻是一致的想阻止外貨，提倡國貨。</p>
<p>不過，這兩件事實的發生，給與社會影響和國貨運動的幫助，究竟有怎樣的一種反應呢？這實在是值得我們去冷靜的觀察一番的。「跪哭團」還是在最近的初次發現，對於牠我們當然不便下什麼判斷：但如悅來吃炸彈這類史實，已經有了不少的次數，可是在國貨運動史上又有了什麼效果？</p>
<p>據最近海關發表的輸入指數，單是屬於娛樂的消耗，就有一千多萬的驚人的數字：由此可見歷來抵制外貨提倡國貨的運動，一切都是浪費的，毫無成績可言。現在，我們且看一看這驚人的數目：</p>
<p>「九月份無綫電材料之由滬進口，計十三萬○三百三十—金單位：折合國幣爲二十六萬○六百六十二元，再加合年八個月的進口，爲五十一萬七千○四十元金單位，折合國幣爲三百○三萬四千○九十二元，合計國幣爲三百二十九萬四千七百五十三元。九月份脂粉香水之由滬進口，計四萬五千一百九十三—金單位，拆合國幣爲九萬○三百八十六元，再加今年八個月進口總數，計五十八五萬一千四百二十九金單位，折合國幣爲一百十六萬一千八百五十八元，合計總數爲一百二十五萬三千二百四十四元。九月份犬類及有生動物之由滬進口，本年九個月合計十四萬六千四百九十六—金單位，折合國幣爲二十九萬二千九百九十二元。九月份汽車之由滬進口，計四十七萬八千○六十五—金單位，折合國幣爲九十五萬六千一百三十元，再加今年八個月之進口總數，計五百八十二萬二千七百七十九—金單位，折合國幣爲一千一百六十四萬五千五百五十八元。合計總值爲一千二百六十萬○一千六百八十元。合以上四項總值共爲國幣一千七百四十四萬二千六百七十七元。」</p>
<p>我們看了上面四種輸入的貨品中，除無綫電和汽車是我國絕無的東西而外，至於香水及飛禽走獸這一類的東西不見得會沒有罷？可是，丟掉自已所有的東西不用，偏偏把四百五十四萬七千九百九十七元這麼多的金錢送到洋大人的口袋襄才覺甘心，這能說是從事國貨運動的人的倡導不力的結果嗎？</p>
<p>在這裹，我們可以得到的解答是：產業界沒有力自振奮的覺悟，政府對外貨的入超沒有阻止的方策，民衆沒有愛用國貨的自信，縱然再加上一百個梁桐芳出來投彈，和無數的「跪哭團」出來哀懇，然而海關所發表的入超的數字，終歸還是逐漸增加的啊！</p>

<h3>擇偶論</h3>
<p>— 葛虎</p>
<p>廚川白村曾說：「戀愛乃是兩個異性，即一男一女的結合，以互相完成，互相充實一個人之自已的兩性合奏曲。」由此我們很可明顯的知道，戀愛的終極決不能離「營兩性生活」的目的的。但在狂熱的愛潮裹，多數青年男女，都盲目的迷戀著對方，而又並沒有加以理智的透視，只是將「心的幻象」認爲是完全人格的神，只有崇拜，只有讚美，竟無暇去發現對方的瑕疵，更無暇談到選擇，這實已臨到了一個極大的危機了。我們常見一對情人，既已情如膠漆，但爲什麼過了狂戀時期已達結婚階段時，反而時相反目，甚至感到無窮的痛苦呢？並且，常有人說，「結婚是愛情的墳墓，」但結婚爲什麼不能更增加情感而走入墳墓呢？這些都是因爲在戀愛或結婚之前缺乏考慮的緣故，由是可知擇偶條件的重要了。</p>

On the 31st, the Japanese military headquarters in Chengde sent a plane to Malanyu to deliver an order transferring the Miyama company to Xifengkou and Lengkou on the 11th for garrison duty. The Japanese originally stationed at these passes were transferred to Chengde. The Wang Regiment of the puppet Rehe army was left to guard the tombs in Dongling. The remaining puppet regiment commander arrived in Malanyu on the 31st to contact the Japanese commander Miyama. After the meeting, he ordered his troops to transport supplies and move to the new garrison. It was decided ten days ago to complete the withdrawal. Most of the Japanese military supplies have been transported away, waiting for our side to take over.

They only left on the 2nd, and the residents suffered great disturbance. Yin Tixin has reported this to Yin Rugeng, who has forwarded it to the Japanese side for negotiation to prevent the puppet army from entering and exiting freely in the future to avoid misunderstandings.

Chen Hanguang arrived in the province by plane from Huaiji at noon on the 3rd and is scheduled to go to Shaozhou on the 4th. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] A telegram from Lechang on the 3rd stated that Jiangxi bandits fled from Chongyi via Linze and Guting on the 2nd and gathered at Longxu on the Xiang border.

<h3>Postal Parcel Transit Tax Has Been Agreed to Be Abolished</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Customs has customarily levied a transit tax on foreign postal parcels entering the mainland.

It has been learned that both parties have agreed to abolish this transit tax, effective from the 1st of this month. The matter has been reported to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications for record. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The End of the German Political-Religious Dispute</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>European telegrams report that Hitler has eased the policy of religious control, and the two bishops who opposed the government's attempt are ready to return to their posts, while Bishop Mueller may resign. If this is true, then the German political-religious dispute may come to an end.</p>
<p>Since the Nazi Party came to power in March last year, it has been engaged in the so-called movement of the collective state. Taking advantage of the situation, all political parties were eliminated one by one. After all political parties were eliminated, it turned its attention to religious institutions. Among them, only the Catholic Church, though restricted, was able to maintain its autonomy. This was due to the support of the Roman Pope on the one hand, and the fact that the Saar region was mostly Catholic on the other. Hitler had been hoping for the return of the Saar to Germany day and night, so he could not but show some tolerance for the religious freedom of Catholics. However, its control of Christianity has been proceeding relentlessly and with all its might since June last year. The method of control was to select a Nazi believer named Mueller from among the Christians of the Nazi Party to be the Archbishop of Germany, reorganize the German Church into the German National Church, and make its actions in line with the Nazi Party. The Nazi Party rejects Jews, and they also reject Jews. Nazi Party members are loyal to Hitler, and the priests of the National Church must also be loyal to Hitler. Moreover, they deliberately create a false connection, recognizing the revolution of the German Nazi faction as inspired by God. At the same time, priests and pastors who cannot agree with this measure and express opposition are dismissed. Church property is also confiscated. Their words, meetings, associations, and other actions are suppressed in every possible way. The intention seems to be to make religion an appendage of politics and the Church a tool of political leaders.</p>
<p>However, since Mueller was appointed as the Archbishop of the country with the power of the political party, it has been almost a year and a half. Although the number of priests who have been dismissed has reached more than 800, and the number of churches that have been taken over and controlled has reached 22 states, the movement against Mueller has not only not weakened because of this, but has also become more vigorous. For example, at the beginning of Mueller's appointment, the opposition issued a declaration, arguing that religious matters should not be restricted by political forces, because the mission of Christians is to carry out God's will and should not be the tool of any individual. At the end of last year, the Priests' Emergency Joint Association was established and sent a letter to Mueller, stating that if Mueller insists on going his own way and disrupts the peace of the Church, then they will no longer trust him. By January of this year, Mueller implemented a Church dictatorship. Pastors who advocated Martin Luther's actions to resist the teachings of the Bible were actually few in number. Although the oppression of police violence could not suppress the rising tide of resistance. And in April, after Jacob was appointed as the legal management committee of the National Church, the control movement was pushed even more vigorously. The idea was that the Church must also be unified, otherwise it would be difficult to have peace. However, the opposition immediately protested and organized a National Free Church at the end of May, denouncing Mueller for abusing his power and his words and deeds being contrary to the New Testament. The main points were about six: (1) Denying that the revolution of the Nazi Party was a manifestation of God's will. (2) Reaffirming that the power and love of Christ are higher than everything else. (3) The Nazi Party's nationalism is not based on the revelation of Christianity and cannot be regarded as the supreme principle. (4) The Church should not imitate secular organizations, so it is absolutely impossible to apply the Nazi Party's rule to the Church. (5) The Church should transcend politics and should not be driven by politics. (6) The Church cannot serve any other master except God. From these six points, it can be seen that the opposition's position is not only stern and righteous, but also has an extraordinary spirit, with the idea that even if they go through fire and water, they will not hesitate to protect the Church. Therefore, what the Nazi Party applies to other political parties can succeed, but what it applies to religion may not succeed. The reason is obvious.</p>
<p>It has been found that before Hitler came to power, he not only had no intention of controlling religion, but also had a declaration of non-interference in religious freedom. After all political parties were eliminated, he thought that any event could succeed if carried out with the spirit and perseverance of the Nazi Party. Therefore, there was an attempt to control religion. As for the fact that the resistance force is so great, it was something that he did not expect at first. However, Germany is the birthplace of Protestantism. The rise of Protestantism was because the power of the old religion was too concentrated at the top, and the organization of the government was too bureaucratic. Therefore, it wanted to replace it with a new Protestantism that was closer to the people and more democratic. What the Mueller faction is doing is probably similar to the old religion of the Middle Ages. The power is concentrated in the hands of the bishop, and the teachings are also distorted. If it is pushed to the extreme, it will inevitably lead to the loss of the true meaning of Christianity. The Christians of Germany, inheriting Luther's legacy and bathing in the spirit of Protestant freedom for a long time, have risen to protect the Church. The boundless and accumulated power, once released, cannot be stopped, which is indeed within expectations. If the German authorities insist on going their own way, they may not necessarily cause internal strife, but it will be enough to incur the aversion of other Christian countries, thereby increasing diplomatic difficulties, or it may be a due result. Moreover, those who truly believe in Christianity will never be subdued by force. Forcing control will only waste time. The country will not only fail to achieve the effect of unity, but will also have the danger of self-division. Now that Hitler has repented and decided to give up the plot to control religion, his views are no less than those of a high-level person.</p>
<h3>Japan Purchases Iron Ore from Russia</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Japan recently concluded a contract with Soviet Russia to import gasoline. According to today's news, the Japan Iron Ore Joint Sales Company has concluded a contract with the Soviet Russian commercial representative in Tokyo, stipulating that Japan will purchase 40,000 metric tons of iron ore from Soviet Russia annually. This purchase of iron ore by Japan is in accordance with the policies of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce and the Japan Steel Company. Although Japan currently does not feel a shortage of iron ore, domestic demand is increasing daily. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Belgian Financial Constraints</h3>
<p>Rumors of Abandoning the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Brussels The Belgian government recently nearly collapsed due to differences of opinion on the budget balance issue. The cabinet met again today to discuss the matter. It is said that Belgium's economic situation has become more constrained recently, and it may abandon the gold standard. The gold reserves of the National Bank of Belgium currently amount to 2,633,851,000 yuan. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Shift in British Public Opinion: Unexpected Victory for the Labor Party in Municipal Elections</h3>
<p>Gaining 456 More Seats Than Before</p>
<p>Conservative Policies Are Outdated</p>
<p>[London] The Labor Party's victory in the municipal council elections has become clear today. According to the latest reports, the Labor Party has now won 770 seats, with only 29 losses. The Conservative Party won 41 seats, with 635 losses. The Liberal Party won 14 seats, with 71 losses. The status of the independents has not changed. Taking London as an example, the Labor Party has won 456 seats, while the Conservative Party has only one. The Labor Party now controls 41 municipal councils and 15 in London. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>The final results of the municipal council elections are as follows, in total:</p>
<p>Seats Gained Compared to Previous  Seats Lost Compared to Previous</p>
<p>Conservative Party 0 394</p>
<p>Labor Party 456 1</p>
<p>Liberal Party 0 56</p>
<p>Independent Labor Party 0 6</p>
<p>Others 0 3</p>
<p>(3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The final results of the municipal council elections in various places have been announced. The Labor Party gained 438 more seats than before, of which 394 were seized from the original seats of the Conservative Party. Even the leaders of the Labor Party did not expect the Labor Party's victory. Taking only London as an example, the 28 city council districts in the city, of which 15 districts are completely in the hands of the Labor Party (previously only occupied 4 districts, and in the other 13 districts, the number of seats occupied by the Labor Party has also increased. Generally speaking, the number of voters in this election was limited, and the Labor Party's door-to-door spirit did not encounter strong resistance, so its victory was very easy. The government will not ignore the signs of the election results and will therefore more actively promote nationwide unity propaganda. (This propaganda is at the suggestion of Prime Minister MacDonald and will be promoted this winter.) As for general political and diplomatic aspects, the election results are quite influential. Indirectly speaking, it is undoubtedly a criticism of the government's conservative policies. According to recent years, the British people's attention to international issues is obviously visible. In the eyes of ordinary voters, disarmament is the most important of various diplomatic issues. Therefore, inferring from the change in public opinion this time that voters are dissatisfied with conservative policies is certainly not an exaggeration. In mid-October, the British League of Nations Association held a large-scale national referendum, seeking national opinions on methods to maintain peace. A response will be given within a month. What attitude the people hold towards the policies adopted by the government will soon have an important indication. We can wait and see.</p>
<h3>Lower House Passes Third Reading of Bill to Prevent Incitement to Sedition</h3>
<p>[London] During the final stage of the debate in the House this afternoon on the bill to prevent incitement to sedition, opposition leader Mr. Lansbury delivered a passionate forty-minute speech attacking the bill. He stated that he had heard no clear evidence regarding the necessity of the bill. Lansbury also vehemently refuted the government's assertion that those who oppose the bill do not support freedom of speech but rather encourage criminal activity. His old courage had not diminished in the slightest. Prime Minister MacDonald came to the House to respond to Labor MP Milner's question regarding a letter he had sent to a pacifist who had been imprisoned during the Great War, praising him. He stated that the past and present situations were different and could not be compared. His support for the bill was based on remembering everything from the past. The bill aimed to protect the freedom of the nation, and his support in the smoking room was an attempt to fulfill his duty to the people. The bill was then put to a third reading and passed by a vote of 241 to 65. It will now be sent to the Upper House for discussion. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons today passed the highly contentious Sedition Act with an overwhelming majority. The bill passed its third reading with 241 votes in favor and 65 against. This is quite astonishing because the bill faced repeated opposition during its discussion in the House of Commons. The bill stipulates that anyone who incites mutiny in the Imperial armed forces shall be imprisoned. The police have the power to search private residences and other buildings, and search warrants can be issued for anyone deemed suspicious. The first and second readings of the bill were completed in the previous parliament. Its final reading was placed on the agenda of this session of parliament and is the most important bill of this session. The government hopes that the bill can be enacted by the end of November. The bill's proposer, Inskip, also argued that the purpose of the bill is only to protect the British army, navy, and air force personnel from the influence of the Communist Party and other secret propaganda. Opponents attacked the bill, saying that it has a fascist character and uses imprisonment to intimidate and suppress the British people from expressing their political views. Pacifists said that the bill will be used to harm pacifists. The bill was slightly amended before its passage to appease the anger of opponents, but it did not affect the substance of the bill.

<h3>Tax Increase Issue Tied to Fate of Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>Finance Minister's Sudden Visit to Elder Statesman Causes Controversy</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Seiyukai believes that the government is not seeking reform of the fiscal and tax systems, nor is it establishing countermeasures to relieve disasters. Instead, it is merely catering to a portion of its power base and implementing partial tax increases in a haphazard manner. Therefore, it absolutely opposes the tax increase plan. Because of this, the tax increase plan is struggling to be introduced in the Diet and is bound to be rejected or even fail to be deliberated. If this happens, Finance Minister Fujii and the current cabinet will either resign en masse or have no choice but to dissolve the Diet. Therefore, the tax increase issue will become a major issue that determines the fate of the cabinet. (3rd Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Finance Minister Fujii's determination to increase taxes has been confirmed as a result of his visit to Prince Saionji. After meeting with Prime Minister Okada, the attitude of the government's leadership will be decided. The Prime Minister will absolutely support the Finance Minister. The atmosphere within the cabinet is also aware that tax increases are unavoidable. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance's new tax increase plan will be unanimously passed by the cabinet. The military ministers only agree with the tax increase and will not oppose it. The only issue is the Seiyukai's tough stance in the Diet. What measures Prime Minister Okada will take in response to this is worthy of attention. Also, Finance Minister Fujii's tax increase plans, such as increasing postal rates and incorporating railway profits, have not yet been fully understood by the relevant ministries. It is said that it will not be implemented next year. (3rd Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Finance Minister Fujii, not only to cabinet members but even to Prime Minister Okada, did not reveal his intentions. His sudden absence from the cabinet meeting to visit the elder statesman is considered to be putting the cart before the horse. Public opinion of the Finance Minister is likely to worsen, and at the same time, the cabinet has also lost sympathy for the Finance Minister. It may affect his current political standing, and his future is pessimistic. (3rd Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nicaraguan Vice President Visits Hirota</h3>

<h3>President Wakatsuki of Japan's Minseito Party Remains Determined to Resign</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the issue of the presidency of the Minseito party, because President Wakatsuki still refuses to retract his intention to resign, the executives have no choice but to gather party opinions and support the nomination of Chuji Machida. The resolution of the issue will be delayed until after the 5th. If Mr. Machida's determination to decline the position remains firm, the Minseito party will face an extremely difficult situation, and the leaders are quite anxious.

<h3>Anti-Japanese Sentiment Strong Among American People</h3>
<p>Willing to Help Government Strengthen Navy</p>
<p>Hoping for Joint Anglo-American Restraint of Japan</p>
<p>[Washington] Government officials today generally feel that the American people are increasingly impatient with Japan's attitude on the "Manchukuo" oil monopoly issue, the restrictions on British and American oil companies in Japan, and the increasing intimidation by the Japanese navy. It is said that this impatience began to appear a few months ago when the Japanese government issued its declaration of its sole dominance in China, and now it has reached its peak due to the oil dispute and the Japanese naval representatives' firm attitude towards the London talks. Senior government officials declared that the American people are, in fact, no longer concerned about whether or not the naval treaty continues, and are prepared to support plans to strengthen the defense of naval bases in the Pacific. Officials also expressed their confidence that, given the American people's mentality, if Japan insists on building more battleships, it will fully support the government: for every three ships Japan builds, the United States will build five. Editorials in important newspapers, speeches and talks by prominent political observers, and other expressions of public opinion all believe that Japan's economic, political, and military penetration into China is consistent with its naval policy, and its purpose is to drive Westerners out of the Asian continent. Officials continued, stating that all parties believe that if the London naval talks are to achieve any success, the unity of Britain and the United States is essential. Britain knows that Japan's naval power is already superior to the naval power in the British territories, so the loss it would suffer from any further increase in Japanese power is greater than that of the United States. Therefore, Britain is more eager to maintain the current naval ratio than the United States. From this point of view, cooperation between the United States and Britain is the desire of the American officials, and they are sympathetic to Britain's request to build more cruisers. However, the United States is also quite wary, fearing that it will be fooled by Britain and bear the blame for the failure of the naval negotiations. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Awaits Japanese Reply on Manchukuo Oil Monopoly</h3>
<p>Japan Curtails, Evades Responsibility</p>
<p>Obscures Key Points of Dispute</p>
<p>US Prepares Further Protest</p>
<p>[Washington] Further actions by the United States regarding the oil dispute with "Manchukuo" and Japan are currently postponed pending a formal response from Japan before determining future actions. The State Department today received a telegram from US Ambassador to Japan Grew, briefly describing the informal abridgement of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's response to the US protest. Japan's formal reply should also be delivered soon. Undersecretary of State Phillips said that the Japanese Foreign Ministry's statement only addressed the oil issue within Japan and obscured all points of contention, raising only matters irrelevant to the case, so it was not satisfactory. Phillips also solemnly stated that the State Department is handling the oil issue in Japan and "Manchukuo" separately, because from an international perspective, the issue of "Manchukuo" is becoming more serious. Japan claims to have nothing to do with "Manchukuo" and has asked the United States to negotiate directly with "Manchukuo." Washington believes that this is entirely Japan dodging responsibility, so after studying Japan's informal abridgement, the US government will make a further protest. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Oil Control Violates Treaty Obligations</h3>
<p>London Opinion</p>
<p>[London] Some opinions in London believe that the implementation of an oil monopoly in "Manchukuo" violates Japan's treaty obligations to China, which it has stated it would abide by. Granting this monopoly to a company with 80% Japanese capital is certainly worthy of criticism. There is also the question of whether this act violates Article 3 of the Washington Convention by granting special interests to Japanese companies. The main purpose of Japan's new oil law seems to be to store large quantities of oil and encourage the Japanese oil refining industry. All of this benefits the Japanese government and harms foreign oil companies. The broad power to control the oil industry allows the Japanese government to: (1) set prices; (2) determine the annual import quota for each company; (3) compel oil companies to expand their oil storage facilities and establish refineries in Japan when necessary. Therefore, the major foreign oil companies involved must spend huge sums of money to build additional oil storage facilities and increase their oil reserves to more than three times their current amount, without any guarantee that these huge expenses will be recouped in the future. In other words, after the companies spend this huge sum of money, there is no guarantee that the Japanese government will not use arbitrary means to set prices and limit the scope of annual business, thereby preventing the companies from recovering the loss of their expenses.

<h3>Naval Conference Situation Perilous, Britain and US Seek Compromise</h3>
<p>Japan Still Insists on Equal Demands</p>
<p>US Advocates Slight Revision of Existing Agreement</p>
<p>[London] Japanese representative Rear Admiral Yamamoto told a Reuters interviewer today, "Japan does not want to deviate even slightly from the basic principles of its naval plan. Japan regards this as absolutely unchangeable." He then made another statement, further emphasizing the seriousness of his words: "We have no other way."</p>
<p>At this perilous juncture, everything is now focused on the talks between US Chief Delegate Davis and British Foreign Secretary Simon. The two key figures met secretly twice yesterday afternoon and will continue to meet. Reliable sources believe that British and American representatives are now striving to find a way to accommodate Japan's demand for "theoretical equality." The Japanese representatives now support this demand, saying that Japan cannot politically agree to the continuation of clauses such as the 5-5-3 ratio. The Japanese feel that this type of clause greatly damages their national prestige. Japanese people here say that Japan does not want to expand its navy to be able to compete with Britain and the United States. Although Japan wants to obtain "theoretical equality" in total tonnage, it does not want to expand its warship construction plans for economic reasons. Japan is willing to formulate its naval policy on the basis of pure self-defense. This is why it advocates reducing the number of battleships, aircraft carriers, and 10,000-ton cruisers. The Japanese feel that the spheres of naval influence of Japan, the United States, and Britain are all widely separated, so there is no difficulty in accepting the self-defense basis for concluding a new treaty.</p>
<p>It is said that the attitude of the United States is still to advocate slightly revising the existing treaty and continuing its effectiveness. However, it is also very welcome to reduce the number of various types of warships by 20%. It is also heard that the talks between British and Japanese experts are extremely harmonious in nature. They feel that their policies are somewhat the same, and their opinions on the categories of warships considered "essential" are in agreement. Japan now supports the British proposal to reduce the tonnage and armaments of large cruisers. Japan accepts the British proposal for a proportional increase in 7,000-ton cruisers. The British position on destroyers and aircraft carriers is also praised by the Japanese naval community.</p>
<p>Japanese representative Yamamoto told a Reuters interviewer today that Japan hopes that its proposal can be clearly understood by Britain and the United States. At the same time, his country is still determined not to move even slightly. Some people may think that Japan has a second plan. He wants to firmly declare that the basic principles of the Japanese plan are absolutely unchangeable. "We have no other way to replace it. Our explanation may have failed to allow representatives of other countries to understand its true meaning. If there is another opportunity to continue to explain, he will use it. Although he does not dare to have extravagant hopes for the outcome, he is not pessimistic to the point of declaring that the current situation has become an absolute stalemate. Japan has not made any concessions. If representatives of other countries propose a new plan that does not conflict with the basic principles of the Japanese plan, he is willing to consider it and strive to reach a compromise. At the same time, Japan cannot agree to discuss technical theories such as qualitative limitations." (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>No New Developments in Naval Talks</h3>
<p>Three Countries Conduct Diplomatic Exploration</p>
<p>[London] There will be no new developments in the naval talks by the end of this week. Yesterday, the British government notified the Italian and French embassies of the progress of the naval talks. This action does not imply that France and Italy will participate in the naval talks, but is merely a routine procedure to inform them from time to time.</p>
<p>It is expected that British, Japanese, and American representatives will play golf and visit their friends at the end of this week. The second step of the talks will be a non-public talk between British Foreign Secretary Simon and Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira, which is scheduled for around Monday of next week. The current talks are limited to non-public meetings between the three countries' chief representatives, as they want to conduct diplomatic exploration to find a compromise on which to continue technical discussions. It is felt that it will not be beneficial for naval experts to join the discussion until an agreement has been reached on the principles involved.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Mediates US-Japan Opinions</h3>
<p>[London] The final meeting between US and Japanese representatives regarding the initial negotiations of the naval conference (October 31) did not yield results, so the talks have been temporarily suspended. It is rumored that a reconciliation plan has been found that will allow the talks to resume. This news has not been confirmed by the US and Japanese delegations, who only stated that the situation of the naval talks has not changed, and both sides are still adhering to their original positions. However, it is not impossible that Prime Minister MacDonald will attempt to reconcile the opinions of the United States and Japan again tomorrow when he hosts a luncheon at his villa in Chequers for the Japanese representatives.

<p>British Prime Minister MacDonald and his daughter hosted a luncheon at his villa today for the Japanese representatives. This was purely a matter of reciprocity and did not invite British and American representatives to accompany them. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>US and Japanese Experts Each Demonstrate Eloquence</h3>
<p>This morning, naval experts from the United States and Japan, who are engaged in US-Japan talks in London, gathered to talk. During the technical discussion of Japan's proposed equality demands, US Admiral Standley insisted that the progress of the Japanese navy is enough to be equal to the US Navy. The Japanese navy is not calculated by numbers but by actual strength, and its strength is equal to that of the United States. Japanese representative Yamamoto said that the ratio under the Washington Convention is no longer three to five. "We try to prove it. We can exchange fleets with each other. If you give me your country's navy, and I give you my country's navy, then my pride will be the same as yours." Everyone laughed when they heard this.

<h3>Herriot Discusses Friendly French-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>[Moscow] Former French Prime Minister Herriot told a special reporter for Pravda that the foundation of French-Soviet friendship today is very solid and has great hope. Herriot also said, "With the greatest confidence, I observe the future of French-Soviet relations. I firmly believe that in the future, both France and the Soviet Union will be able to express goodwill and mutual understanding of interests, as in the past." In order to develop and deepen the relations between the two countries, the leaders of the two countries should strengthen and repeatedly make personal visits. At the same time, it is necessary to adjust the economic relations between the two countries so that these relations do not fall behind political, scientific, and knowledge cooperation. The political leaders of both countries must consider the following facts: that due to the world economic panic and the situation in Western Europe, there may be some obstacles to the progress of certain French-Soviet relations. "In order to complete the great task of French-Soviet friendship, we must jointly find ways to eliminate these obstacles. We will continue to work together in Geneva to seek the guarantee of world peace. In the past and in the future, I have deeply realized the great benefits of French-Soviet friendship for the people of both countries and European peace. The future barbaric war will first inflict a great blow on the broad masses of working people. I believe that the people of France and the Soviet Union can indeed save the world and avoid this barbarity." At the end of the interview, Herriot asked to convey the following greetings to the readers of Pravda: "The Soviet Union is about to commemorate the 17th anniversary of the October Revolution. I respectfully congratulate the readers of Pravda and the people of the Soviet Union. I wish to see all the successes and prosperity of the workers of your great country. I believe that they will also be able to safeguard peace with the same courage and determination in the 18th anniversary of the October Revolution." (2nd TASS dispatch)</p>

<h3>Cabinet Passes Constitutional Amendment to Save Political Crisis</h3>
<p>Radical Party Reserves Right to Free Vote in Parliament on Dissolving House of Representatives</p>
<p>[Paris] The constitutional reform bill proposed by Prime Minister Doumergue has been passed by the majority of the Council of State. Its contents are as follows: (1) The number of cabinet members shall not exceed 20, and the prime minister shall not concurrently manage departments. (2) The President may announce the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies within the first year of its term, but with the consent of the Senate, and in subsequent years, consent is not required. (3) Regarding the budget, in addition to the government's proposals, members of the Chamber of Deputies must, before suggesting expenditures, first request the Chamber of Deputies to pass an equal amount of revenue. If the budget bill has not been passed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies before January 1 of the relevant year, the government may, by legal order, extend all or part of the previous year's budget. (4) An article shall be added to the constitution to guarantee the stability of the status of officials. Those who are suspended from service or jointly suspend service without reason shall be deemed to have severed relations with the state. (3rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[Paris] This morning, a Council of State meeting was held at the Presidential Palace. The constitutional reform bill proposed by Prime Minister Doumergue was passed by a majority of cabinet members. After the meeting, Minister Without Portfolio Herriot issued a communiqué to the press on behalf of the Radical Party cabinet members, stating that the Radical Party cabinet members have reserved their right to freely vote on the point of the reform bill concerning dissolving the Chamber of Deputies without the consent of the Senate when it is discussed in the parliament in the future. (3rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to discuss Prime Minister Doumergue's constitutional reform bill on Tuesday. This matter is also related to the safety of the government. It is reported that the Radical Socialist Party still opposes the second point in the reform bill, which could become the key to Doumergue's political fate. The five Radical Socialist Party cabinet members are currently meeting with leaders to discuss the attitude to be taken on Tuesday. If they actually hold an opposing attitude, there is still a risk that Doumergue's cabinet will collapse. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Comet Completes Round Trip Flight Between England and Australia</h3>
<p>Sets New Record of Thirteen Days and Six Hours</p>
<p>[London] This afternoon, when the Comet aircraft, piloted by Jones and Waller, landed at the Lympne Aerodrome, both said, "It's too late. We originally expected to be faster." The two aviators completed the round trip flight between England and Australia in 13 days, 6 hours, and 33 minutes, setting a new record and setting seven other new speed records, five of which were set between Melbourne and Singapore. The two aviators were warmly welcomed by the crowd when they landed. The aircraft owner, Rubin, was also present. Jones claimed that there is no reason why a regular commercial flight between England and Australia in less than five days cannot become a reality. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Melbourne aviators Hewitt and Kay, who participated in the speed and obstacle flying competition between England and Australia, arrived here this morning. They arrived three days earlier than the 16-day deadline for the competition. The obstacle flying only counts the flying and stay time outside of the 25 checkpoints, so although the Hewitts completed the entire journey in 13 days, it would have been considered a very good result six or seven years ago. Their ranking will be known only after their daily records have been checked. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Debt Agreement Established, US Clearly Discriminated Against</h3>
<p>Plans to Protest to Germany</p>
<p>[New York] The British and German governments recently reached a clearing agreement in which the German government recognizes that interest on the Dawes and Young bonds will be paid in full from January 1, 1935. The United States believes that this is preferential treatment for British bondholders by Germany. The State Department plans to protest to Germany in the name of the American holders of German bonds in the near future. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Hitler's Ban on National Socialist Party Activities Alleviates Tension in the Saar</h3>
<p>Germany Does Not Want to Appeal to the Hague Tribunal Regarding French Military Preparations</p>
<p>Britain Says It Will Only Participate as a Member of the League of Nations</p>
<p>[Berlin] Since France declared that it would send troops to assist as soon as the Saar Administrative Commission encountered disturbances and requested assistance, the Saar issue has suddenly become tense. German "Leader and Chancellor" Hitler's representative in the Saar region, Burckel, issued a ban on the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers and the Saar border guard to ease public anxiety, stating that from January 10 to February 10 next year (the Saar plebiscite is scheduled for January 13), they must not wear uniforms, parade in formation, or hold any gatherings within 40 kilometers along the Saar region's border (Havas dispatch on the 3rd).</p>
<p>[London] There has been no official announcement regarding rumors about the Saar. It is said that rumors such as France's request for Britain to send troops into the Saar, and Britain's inevitable agreement, are not true. Furthermore, the French authorities have not discussed this matter with the British authorities. It is widely believed that Britain's attitude is only to participate in the issue as a member of the League of Nations, and it recognizes that the Saar is a dangerous point and deeply hopes that a satisfactory solution can be found.</p>
<p>It is now widely rumored that Germany intends to appeal to the Hague International Permanent Court regarding France's military preparations to prevent incidents in the Saar, but German officials have neither denied nor confirmed this news (Reuters on the 3rd).</p>
<p>[London] Berlin officials announced that the German government has no intention of appealing to the Hague International Permanent Court regarding France's military preparations to prevent incidents in the Saar. News from Berlin said that Burckel's order prohibiting the National Socialist Party from wearing uniforms has greatly changed the situation. This move should dispel the French officials' fears about Germany's attitude. The French government should eventually withdraw the activists it sent into the Saar and withdraw the troops stationed on both sides of the border. The French government should also make every effort to prevent any accidental events from happening (Reuters telegram on the 3rd).</p>
<p>[London] A certain newspaper of Hitler stated that France should be clearly told that the international definition of an aggressor is a country that invades foreign borders with troops. It also stated that the Treaty of Versailles also recognizes the Saar as German territory. At the same time, political circles in Rome hope that if France has to send troops to the area due to the activities of the Saar National Socialist Party, it should ask for assistance from other countries (Reuters telegram on the 3rd).</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Hardship in Japanese Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Farmers in the Cold Northern Regions Have No Means of Survival</p>
<p>In recent years, the progress of Tokyo and Osaka, the two major cities, has been rapid. All the main streets have been paved with asphalt, and Western-style wooden buildings have become popular. Only about 10-20% of male and female students wear old-fashioned skirts and robes. Although male students do not wear very fancy Western suits, their uniforms are very neat. Female students mostly have some air of extravagance. In short, the development of Japanese cities is indeed worthy of following Europe and the United States. Because of the promotion of the military authorities, the general public's sense of tension in this extraordinary period is, aside from the upper and middle classes, just so-so. As for the rural areas, the farmers are suffering from the oppression of life and of course have to take care of their own stomachs first.</p>
<p>In the six northeastern prefectures, Iwate, Fukushima, Yamagata, Aomori, Miyagi, and Akita, Iwate Prefecture suffered a total loss of 35 million yuan due to the cold weather, with more than 70,000 poor farm households and a reduction of 44%. Fukushima Prefecture suffered a loss of 32 million yuan in crops, with 96,000 affected farm households and a reduction of 25%. Yamagata Prefecture suffered a total loss of 24 million yuan in agricultural products, with about 40,000 poor farm households and a reduction of about 25%. Aomori Prefecture suffered a loss of about 20 million yuan due to frost damage, with 60,000 poor farm households and a reduction of about 42%. Miyagi Prefecture suffered a total loss of 25 million yuan due to frost damage, with 40,000 poor farm households and a reduction of 34%. Akita Prefecture had the least reduction, only 18%, but the total loss was no less than 20 million yuan, and there were still 35,000 poor farm households. In addition, Niigata and Morioka are not very good, just a little better than the above prefectures.</p>
<p>Such a famine, in the Hokuriku region, according to historical records, is cyclical. But since the second year of Meiji (1869) until now, there have been almost ten famines, but this year is the most severe. For example, in the Mogami District of Yamagata Prefecture, there are actually rural villages "without weddings, without food." Many farmers are mortgaging their 13-14 year old daughters to others or selling them to others to be barmaids (similar to female receptionists), female workers, prostitutes, or maids, and the price is only 70-80 yuan. However, it is still late autumn, the harvest season, and they can still collect something, but they have already sold their children. When the snow season comes and there is nothing on the ground, I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>In the rural villages under Yamagata Prefecture, there are 4,000 chō (each chō is equal to 14.88 Chinese mu) where no grain was harvested, 13,000 chō where the reduction was 70% or more, and 16,200 chō where the reduction was 50% or more. In a normal year, they can harvest 2 million koku (1 koku = 5.1 US bushels), but this year the maximum harvest will be only 1.23 million koku. The rice leaves that have been flooded and have not matured cannot even be used to make ropes, and horses will get diarrhea if they eat them.</p>
<p>Akita Prefecture has a relatively small reduction in agricultural production. The estimated reduction is 440,000 koku. Most of the higher mountainous areas have no harvest. During the harvest period, there is no rice to harvest in the fields, so the whole family is mobilized to go to the mountains to pick chestnuts, acorns, and gather pokeweed leaves and dig bracken roots to prepare for winter when it snows. Almost all the mischievous children in elementary schools have asked for leave to go to the mountains to collect chestnuts. Most ordinary farm families earn less than ten sen (about 9 cents of silver) per day of labor.</p>
<p>The farmers in Kunohe District of Aomori Prefecture are really so poor that they have no choice. Because they have no food to eat, they have to sell their oxen. Oxen worth more than 100 yuan are sold for only 50 yuan. Their main food is barnyard millet, followed by wheat. The side dishes are only pickled cucumbers. Most of them eat (1) wheat cakes, about 20% flour, the rest bran; (2) bran cakes, about 20% flour, the rest rice bran; (3) potato cakes, yams are not peeled, mixed with some turnips, plus about 10% flour; (4) sweet potato cakes, the method is the same as potato cakes, but the main ingredient is sweet potato; (5) pine bark cakes, the red part of the pine bark is peeled off, boiled with ash water, mixed with glutinous rice, mashed into powder and made into cakes. This is still the case when the stored grain has not run out and the autumn harvest has not ended. So, when the severe winter comes, I am afraid that even acorns and bracken roots will be lacking.

<h3>Inspection Notes from the Northwest</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Wu Gengya</p>
<p>The Scenery of Jiuquan, Where the Garrison Troops are Summering</p>
<p>On the 29th, departed from Weidiepu, passed a salt beach, 40 li long, and the width is unknown. The quality is as white as frost, and reeds grow everywhere. Advancing to the slope, it is a sand ridge, which is easier to walk than the salt beach, because it is solid and flat. There is a village called Shanyuanzi, belonging to Gaotai County, with smooth water and lush forests, a spectacular sight. Apricots are as big as fingers, less than one-tenth the size of the large apricots in Lanzhou. Villagers greet each other, cupping their hands and saying hello, with a respectful and sincere attitude, quite like the New Year's greetings in the old capital. Young women with bound feet are operating on their knees, and men also mostly have opium faces. I once lectured on its harm, and everyone listened with pleasure, but I don't know if they can really adopt it. The climate in Gaotai is relatively mild, and the specialty is cotton. The local cloth worn in neighboring counties mostly relies on it, but the weaving is rough and far inferior to the goods from Tianjin and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>After lunch, continued on, with vast desolate wastelands. Traveling for 30-40 li, often with no people in sight. When reaching Maying, there were cultivators, and the wheat ears and poppies planted were quite abundant, but due to economic exhaustion, there was no way to cultivate them extensively, resulting in a daily increase in the area of cultivated wasteland, and no one was reclaiming uncultivated wasteland. There is no store in Maying. Previously stayed overnight in Qingshui. This day, traveled a total of 61 kilometers, about 200 li. Qingshui belongs to Jiuquan County, and has an earthen fort, but it is old and decayed. There are 30-40 households, mostly farmers, and several shops, with neat and presentable goods. However, announcements for raising money for rain prayers were posted everywhere on the streets. Naked children were playing everywhere, sprinkling ash on each other, and the colors of poverty and ignorance could not be avoided. There is a county-run elementary school in the fort. On the whitewashed wall of the school gate, on the left is recorded "Mencius said, the way of Yao and Shun is nothing but filial piety and brotherly love," and on the right is "Zeng Zi said, the way of the husband is nothing but loyalty and forgiveness," in large characters that can be distinguished from a distance. Observing the ink marks, they must have been written more than ten years ago, and have been re-painted in the recent two or three years. A certain gentleman said, "With such a school motto full of corrupt old colors, how can elementary school students understand it?" The reporter replied with a smile, "Chinese people like to go around in circles in everything. Now there are people advocating respecting the classics and restoring the old ways. It is not certain that this eternally unchanged, stale school motto will meet some people in a certain spot in the education circle who have come around in a big circle." Afterwards, seeing the summer vacation notice posted by the principal, using the old calendar instead of the national calendar, the gentleman said again, "If those who want to go around in educational and political circles really meet some school mottoes, I am afraid that the national calendar, which has been reluctantly implemented for more than 20 years, will also be subject to related influences and be cancelled invisibly." Unable to respond, returned in silence. The next morning (30th), went to Jiuquan (Suzhou), traveling 39 kilometers, about 110 li. The scenery seen in the first half of the journey was still too desolate. In the second half of the journey, the villages gradually became denser and the trees more lush. Especially near the county seat, the irrigation canals crisscrossed and the fertile soil was vast. Speaking of the richness of Hexi, it is no wonder that Suzhou and Xing, Gansu and Liang are mentioned together. First passed through the southeastern suburbs of the city. On the banks of a bay of water, on a few acres of grassland, dozens of tents were set up, arranged neatly, shining with white light, and making good use of the terrain, building watchtowers on tall trees. Upon inquiry, it was learned that it was the garrison of Brigade Commander Bu Kang of the cavalry, who was taking advantage of the summer vacation to lead his troops to camp in the wild. Approaching the south gate, the third car suddenly broke the bridge over the moat. Fortunately, the front wheels climbed onto the bank, and the rear wheels were suspended in the air without falling. The bridge was high and the moat deep, which was also considered dangerous. The gate guards first checked the passports before allowing entry. The main street was wide and flat, with willows planted on both sides, their newly sprouted branches and leaves tender and lovely. In the center of the city, a four-story building was built, with crumbling walls and stairs, barely accessible for climbing. Looking south at the snow-capped Qilian Mountains, the crystal-clear ice was refreshing. Looking north at the desert, it was vast and boundless. To the east, the central plains could be reached by a single post road. To the west, Yiwu could be reached, with Yuguan standing majestically. Stepping out of the east gate, the road was lined with ancient and beautiful willows. Looking left, the pavilions and tiered fields overlapped, and the lake water was clear. This is the famous "Jiuquan" (Wine Spring). First saw the Wen Chang Pavilion, Kui Xing Tower, and Fang Ting, and other courtyards, with weeds and dilapidated walls, presenting a desolate scene. The spring is a square pool, right in front of Fang Ting, clear enough to reflect images, and flowing leisurely into the back lake. It was said in the past that the spring gushed out water like pouring pearls, with a sweet taste like wine. This is probably the beauty of listening to the scenery, rather than observing the scenery.</p>
<p>From "Jiuquan", heading southwest, passing dozens of acres of wheat fields, saw Brigade Commander Ma's camps again. Specially went to visit. As soon as entering the sentry line, the guards asked for the reason and led to the brigade headquarters. There were nine tents, the middle one being a high-domed round tent, where the brigade commander lived. The other tents faced it, like stars surrounding the celestial emperor. These were the eight major departments, including the chief of staff, quartermaster, military law officer, military doctor, military intelligence officer, and adjutant. At that time, the brigade commander was praying. Chief of Staff Qin Shengshan received us into the tent. Guns and bullets were neatly arranged. The floor was covered with Hetian woolen carpets, with beautiful textures. Several small rabbits were also kept, tame and lively, playing back and forth in the tent, which was also quite interesting. After chatting for a while, saw the brigade commander, who said that his division (the 100th Division) had a "characteristic, that is, soldiers have regular vacations, so that they can take the opportunity to go home and enjoy family reunion. However, our brigade is stationed here, because it is located on the border of Longxi, which is important for national defense, and the local soldiers are mostly from Xining and Gaolan counties, so the journey is far and inconvenient to take vacations. So we are avoiding the summer heat in the suburbs, and taking advantage of building bunkers, digging trenches, and other exercises," and so on. Afterwards, he led the tour of the camp's internal affairs and the excavated trenches and bunkers, which were neat and uniform, and quite impressive. Finally, he insisted on having dinner, which was set up under the shade of green willows. The evening glow was clear and the breeze was gentle. Enjoyed "hand-grabbed mutton." Although alcohol was prohibited according to regulations, it still had a special flavor. The commerce of Jiuquan used to be very developed because goods from Suiyuan and Xinjiang were traditionally exchanged here. However, due to the drought and disasters, the place was often troubled, merchants dreamed of their feet, and the burden increased, so commerce declined and fell sharply. This year, the place is peaceful and the traffic is unimpeded, and although there are gradual signs of recovery, it is difficult to recover from a chronic illness due to economic exhaustion. The market lacks cash, and businesses are competing to issue paper tickets. For example, Tianshuntang once issued 60,000 yuan, and Quandetang Lehao once issued 50,000 yuan. Quandetang has been ordered to stop issuing, but its paper money is still circulating in the market. During the National Revolutionary Army era, the tickets issued by the Farmers' and Workers' Loan Office can still be used at 50% of their value. Foreign banknotes are not yet in general circulation, but the copper coin tickets of the Ping City Official Money Bureau are convenient to use because the bureau has an exchange office.</p>
<h3>National Army Recovers Changting</h3>
<p>Ruijin and Ninghua will soon be captured</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Changting is located on the upper reaches of the Ting River, with a high and mountainous terrain, rich in bamboo and wood, and famous for Hengjiang paper. The Red bandits exploited its remote and easily defended location as a center for the "Redification" of Fujian. Since Zhu De and Mao Zedong entered Fujian from the border of Jiangxi and Guangdong in 1928, the banditry in western Fujian has spread rapidly after the death of Guo Fengming. Changting, Shanghang, and Wuping were successively occupied by the bandits. The National Army's five encirclement campaigns aimed to converge on Ting and Rui. Zhu and Mao also defended with all their strength. Recently, the Northern Route Army successively captured Guangchang, Shicheng, Xingguo, and Ningdu. The suppression of the Red Army has taken a direct turn for the better. Furthermore, with Shicheng in western Fujian captured by the Third Route Army, the Communist bandits felt the greatest threat and gradually found it difficult to sustain their position. The Eastern Route Li Detachment took advantage of the victory and directly captured Ting City. On the 1st of this month, at 12:00 noon, they recovered Ting City. The remnant bandits retreated to Ruijin and Ninghua. The headquarters has just received a telegram from Jiang Dingwen in Fujian, stating briefly that the Li Detachment captured Changting City at noon and seized countless spoils, which are being inventoried. According to reports, Ting City is only 60 li from Ruijin via Zhongcheng. Now that the Red bandits have lost Changting, Ruijin is like a house without a door. Ninghua is also surrounded by the National Army from Shicheng and Tinghua, and will fall without being attacked. The so-called "pseudo-Central Area" of the bandits has collapsed. Their pseudo-Central Party Department, pseudo-National Government, and pseudo-Military Commission have all moved west. Therefore, the recovery of Ruijin and Ninghua is no longer a problem. (1st)</p>
<h3>Shanxi Province Disaster Situation Statistics</h3>
<p>The number of refugees will reach over 400,000</p>
<p>The disaster area is over 7,000 square li</p>
<p>Property losses are estimated at 5 million yuan</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: This year, various counties in the province have successively suffered from unfavorable weather, including floods, droughts, hailstorms, and insect plagues. The disaster situation has been frequently reported in the newspapers. Although the provincial government has selected and allocated funds for relief, it is like a drop in the bucket, and the efficiency is minimal. The Executive Yuan and the Central Relief Commission, sympathizing with the disaster victims, have also repeatedly telegraphed for detailed reports to allocate funds for relief. Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, caring for his hometown, sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections. The provincial government has also repeatedly ordered the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance, as well as the disaster-stricken counties, to conduct detailed surveys and reports according to regulations. However, due to the vast disaster area and the severity of the losses, 65 counties have submitted reports to date. Many others have not yet completed their investigations and cannot submit reports immediately. This is truly a tragic event in the world. Moreover, at a time when the rural areas of Shanxi are impoverished, this catastrophe has made the lives of the common people even more precarious. This time, Sun Huanlun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, took advantage of his trip south to Beijing to compile a booklet summarizing the disaster situation reported by the provincial government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Provincial Relief Commission. He plans to visit the central authorities after the civil service examination conference to plead for the people of Shanxi and request prompt allocation of funds for relief. It is reported that, in addition to the counties that are currently submitting reports successively, the disaster situation statistics of the 65 counties that have already submitted reports total 7,186 square li of disaster area (equivalent to 3,880,440 mu), property losses of 4,918,937.64 yuan, and a disaster-stricken population of 399,932 people.

<h3>Anhui Disaster Relief Association Requests Central Government to Allocate Funds for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>2 million yuan needed for urgent relief</p>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: The Anhui Provincial Disaster Relief Association, considering the severe drought in Anhui Province this year and the sharp decline in the autumn harvest, yesterday submitted a petition to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Military Affairs Commission, and the Executive Yuan, requesting a discretionary allocation of 2 million yuan for urgent relief, in order to provide relief to key areas. The original petition is as follows: "Since the beginning of summer, our province has suffered from severe drought, with insufficient rainfall and crops dying. After dispatching personnel to conduct thorough investigations, the disaster area reaches 49 counties, with 8,718,540 disaster victims and 18,161,420 mu of affected farmland. The cost of lost agricultural products is 21,640,1647 yuan. Other indirect losses include labor, fertilizer, and seed costs. The severity of the disaster is vividly depicted in official documents and newspaper reports. Those who uphold morality and integrity are forced by livelihood to commit suicide by taking poison or hanging themselves. Others, supporting the old and carrying the young, wander around begging for food in other villages. Some risk death to seize rice, affecting political stability. Others forcibly take food from house to house, disregarding the law. There are wealthy people who wore silk and jade and lie dead on the road, and there are poor scholars who are in rags and starve to death in the fields. The number of people dying on the road is countless, and the number of people fleeing in the cold is endless. Villages are empty, and no one lives there. Whether poor or rich, they all perish together. Those who could borrow a few coins from relatives and friends in the past are now penniless. Those who could borrow a few pints of rice from neighbors in the past now have nothing. Eating grass roots and tree leaves is considered better than nothing. Their faces are thin and their bodies are weak, but they are still fortunate to be alive. In recent days, representatives from various counties have come to the association to beg for relief, with their words being urgent and their voices full of tears. Su Shi once said, 'Those who speak shed tears, and I also shed tears.' This situation is even more so. If we do not quickly seek relief and provide urgent relief, winter will soon arrive. Those millions of helpless disaster victims will not have enough to eat or wear. Even a loving mother cannot protect her children, how can the country have its people? Moreover, the bandits who have been extinguished for years are now resurfacing and running rampant in the central and southern counties of Anhui, inciting trouble everywhere. The consequences are unbearable. This is what Han Anguo said: 'Even with high walls and deep moats, strict laws and severe punishments, it is still impossible to stop them.' Jia Yi said, 'When they rise up together, it will be too late to plan for it.' The association feels the crisis and, regardless of taboos, reports the truth. We implore your ministry, council, and government to consider that our province is in a precarious state, with the lives of the people hanging by a thread. How can we help them? Please order the relevant departments and associations to allocate 2 million yuan for urgent relief, so that we can provide relief to key areas, comfort the people, and maintain stability. We are extremely anxious and await orders." (1st)</p>
<h3>Henan Xuchang South Gate Establishes Tobacco Leaf Wholesale Market</h3>
<p>Construction Department orders all counties to announce this widely</p>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The Construction Department recently passed down an order from Liu Zhi, based on a petition from the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, which in turn was based on a letter from the American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee. The letter stated that tobacco leaf transactions in Henan Province have traditionally been concentrated in Xuchang, where the quality of the tobacco leaf determines the price, and transactions are generally fair, benefiting both farmers and merchants. However, after 1928, the baking factories rented by British and American tobacco companies were destroyed, and they could no longer go to collect leaves. Nanyang Tobacco Company was also unwilling to purchase large quantities due to local unrest, and often entrusted others to handle the purchases, seeking convenience. Gradually, the right to purchase leaves shifted to tobacco leaf merchants. However, the tobacco leaf merchants' collection of leaves was not regular. Whenever there was a glut of tobacco, they would stop weighing or reduce prices, causing hardship for farmers. Some farmers were unwilling to transport their leaves to Xuchang. Due to the short tobacco leaf production in 1930, tobacco leaf merchants went to various villages to purchase leaves, and farmers took advantage of this to hoard goods and reap profits. They not only saved the labor and expenses of traveling to Xuchang, but also avoided the pressure of stopping weighing and reducing prices. As a result, the Xuchang tobacco leaf market gradually became dispersed to the villages, and tobacco leaf markets in the villages were almost everywhere. Some raised prices artificially while secretly suppressing the weight, or mixed in mud and sand and soaked it with water. Mixing packages and bundles was especially common. Deceit and suspicion were rampant, often leading to losses and hardship for both farmers and merchants. Tobacco companies also suffered greatly. Although they wanted to go directly to the villages to collect leaves, they dared not go due to the unrest in the area. This was all due to the impact of the inability to concentrate the market. The Committee believes that concentrating the tobacco leaf market is not only convenient for buying and selling, but also a way to improve tobacco leaves. After discussions at a meeting, it was decided to designate the South Gate of Xuchang as the wholesale market, and Shigu Town, North Gate of Xiangcheng, Yingqiao Town, Wangluo Town, the inner city of Jiao County, Zhentou Town, the inner city of Linying, Fancheng Town, South Gate of Yuxian, and the tax collection locations as sub-markets. Buying and selling in the villages is prohibited, so that the tobacco leaf business can be brought into order, benefiting both the public and private sectors. The Department believes that the scattered tobacco leaf market not only leads to inconsistent prices and makes it easy for merchants and farmers to be deceived in buying and selling, but also makes it easy for tobacco leaves to fall into the hands of unscrupulous merchants, who can privately manufacture and evade taxes. It is necessary to have a centralized market to bring the tobacco leaf business into order. Therefore, the Department has submitted a report to your provincial government for investigation, requesting that you order your subordinates to inform merchants and farmers that in the future, buying and selling tobacco leaves should be conducted at the South Gate of Xuchang as the wholesale market, and Shigu Town, North Gate of Xiangcheng, Yingqiao Town, Wangluo Town, and the tax collection locations as sub-markets. Buying and selling in the villages is prohibited, in order to maintain commercial tax revenue. The Department yesterday issued orders to the administrative inspectorates of each district, instructing them to inform all counties under their jurisdiction of this. (October 28)</p>
<h3>Shandong Southern Henan Notorious Bandit "Grass on the Wind" Arrested</h3>
<p>—"King Four Tiger" also caught—</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Special Task Force Leader Liu Yaoting led his team to suppress bandits in the counties of southern and western Shandong, successfully breaking up many bandit groups. Recently, they also reported the suppression of lake bandits in the Nanyang Lake area. Chairman Han specially appointed him as the Director of the Jining Lake Reclamation Bureau. On October 25, the team received reports that dozens of bandits were in the villages of Dongxi Wuxu in the second district of Wenshang County. Liu immediately dispatched Squad Leader Hou Ziliang to lead ten undercover agents to ambush them. On the morning of the 26th, they successfully captured the bandit leaders Xu Shanji and Wang Si. The bandit Xu was agile, good at running, fierce, and daring to fight. He had been a bandit for nearly thirty years and was known as "Grass on the Wind." Wang Si, whose real name was Wang Chaoxuan, was also known as "King Four Tiger" and was also a notorious bandit leader. At the same time, they also seized a Mauser pistol. According to Xu's confession, the bandits gathered at night and went out to loot. Therefore, at eight o'clock that night, Hou Ziliang led another ten men, along with five district guards dispatched by the second district of Wenshang, and escorted the bandit Xu to continue the suppression. As soon as they arrived at the village, the bandits were already prepared and opened fire to resist arrest. The district guards panicked and fled first. Hou led the agents to resist with all their strength for two hours. Agent Wang Chuanliang was shot and killed. The bandits were finally unable to hold on and fled in the night. According to Xu's confession, Zhang Junpo, the district chief of the second district of Wenshang, and the district guards were all colluding with the bandits. Based on the confession, Liu dispatched Hou Zhuliang to arrest Zhang Junpo and seized district guards Pan Zongsheng and Cai Dianke. On the 29th, Liu Yaoting escorted the captured one thousand criminals to Jinan and submitted them to the military law office of the headquarters for interrogation. (October 29)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Implements Labor Service to Build Roads</h3>
<p>—Following Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Order—</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Commander-in-Chief Chiang previously issued an order to the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, requiring all men between the ages of 18 and 40 to perform labor service for several days each year, so that the government can lead from above, and the people can act as a whole from below, to complete various construction projects. The Provincial Government's Department of Construction also received instructions from the headquarters that, with winter approaching, it is imperative to take advantage of the slack season to implement public labor service to carry out all important local projects. The most urgent need and what can be accomplished with the manpower and financial resources of this province is roads. Although the main trunk roads are gradually being completed, the branch roads and county roads are still being opened separately. Furthermore, many of the completed roads have not been paved with gravel surfaces, making it impossible for vehicles to travel on rainy days. Therefore, the provincial authorities have decided to use labor service to build roads and pave gravel surfaces. The methods for conscripting labor and carrying out construction will be developed by the road department to ensure a meticulous plan, with the baojia system as the key to implementing labor conscription.

<h3>Two Security Team Leaders in Dangtu Arrested and Executed in Wuhu</h3>
<p>Rampant in the countryside, selling and releasing prohibited rice</p>
<p>Liu Zhenhua ordered the county government to arrest them</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Zhang Jiayi, the current captain of the Third Security Corps of Dangtu County, and Tao Fuyin, the captain of the Second Detachment, were formerly entrenched in the Caishi township, leading their followers to commit robbery and extortion, dominating the area for a time. Later, in 1927, they were reorganized into the local defense corps, and then reorganized again into their current positions. However, Zhang and others did not restrain themselves because they had gone from bandits to officials, but continued to run rampant in the countryside, disregarding everyone. They traveled with armed bodyguards and fine horses, and their magnificence was awe-inspiring to passersby. Their troops were stationed throughout Dangtu County, including Caishi, Cihu, Xinshi Town, Daqiao, and Heshangqiao. This year, due to the drought in Anhui Province, the export of rice was prohibited. However, Zhang dared to rely on his power to collect fees and release privately transported rice boats, either one jiao per shi or several tens of yuan per boat, as Caishi bordered Jiangsu Province. The paid boats used blue flags during the day and red lights at night as passage markers. Rice merchants and citizens of the county, unable to endure the harassment, reported this to the Nanchang Headquarters and the Anhui Provincial Government. Therefore, when Liu Zhenhua returned to Anhui from Beijing a few days ago and arrived at Caishi, he summoned Zhang for questioning. However, Zhang refused to appear under various pretexts. When Liu passed Caishi, he ordered County Magistrate Ma Jizhuang to lead all the county officials to Wuhu, where they were inspected and addressed at the Second District Commissioner's Office. Zhang still refused to come. Thereupon, Liu sternly ordered the Fifth District Commissioner and County Magistrate Ma to arrest Zhang and Tao within a time limit. After Ma returned to Dangtu, he informed Zhang on the 25th to attend a security corps military conference at the county government, and also dispatched the Second Corps, the Fourth Corps, the Seventh Corps, and the militia to conduct field exercises in the area where Zhang's troops were stationed. Within a few hours, Zhang and Tao were arrested, and the weapons of Zhang's troops were confiscated. However, when searching Zhang's residence, there was some resistance from Zhang's remaining followers, but it was quickly suppressed. Fifty rifles, eight Mauser pistols, and one light machine gun were seized. After Zhang and others were arrested, they were immediately escorted to Wuhu by car. After Commissioner Wang interrogated them, he executed the two men by firing squad on the railroad embankment this morning, following an order from Chairman Liu. (October 28)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Gambling Arrest in Yeshe Leads to Death</p>
<p>Zhu Deming, a patrol officer at the Yeshe branch station, was very strict in cracking down on gambling. Zhang Shangda, 54 years old, suffered from an addiction and was unemployed at home. Relatives and friends sometimes came to play games and gamble with bamboo chips. He had already been arrested twice in succession. Zhang Shangda was truly resentful and vowed to quit gambling and find a job to support his life. However, his family was poor, so he invited relatives and friends to pool funds to form a hui (mutual aid society). Last night (2nd), he hosted a banquet at home, inviting eleven relatives and friends to raise 50 yuan to plan for a new livelihood. After the banquet, those among the relatives and friends who liked to play mahjong gathered to play cards. Unexpectedly, the patrol officer again led the police to surround the front and back doors and entered to arrest them. All those present at the banquet were tied up one by one. Zhang Shangda argued that only four people were gambling and that not everyone should be tied up. He knelt and pleaded for leniency, but it was not granted. Zhang Shangda, ashamed to face his relatives and friends after being arrested three times in a row, secretly went to the bedroom and swallowed raw opium. The police did not stop him. Everyone was taken to the station. At about 11:00, Zhang Shangda's expression suddenly changed. His sister-in-law, Zhang Jiangshi, seeing the ashtray empty, suspected that Shangda had taken poison and rushed to the branch station to report the emergency and summoned a nearby doctor for resuscitation. The doctor thought it was a nervous breakdown and refused to resuscitate him. She went to ask again, but the doctor again used the excuse that the branch station did not allow treatment. Zhang Shangda died that night at the branch station, causing public outrage among the locals. Zhang Jiangshi, the deceased's sister-in-law, came to Songjiang to file a complaint with the court, requesting redress. It is said that after receiving the complaint, the court will send personnel to Yeshe for an inspection.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>County Treasury Officially Established</p>
<p>The county treasury of this county is managed by the Nantong branch of the Jiangsu Bank, as designated by the Department of Finance. Chen Qixiang, an accounting specialist from the Department of Finance, came to Haimen the other day (30th) to discuss the matter with County Magistrate Chen. It was officially established yesterday (1st). In the future, all county government revenues, such as grain taxes and surcharges, must be deposited in the county treasury daily. If funds need to be disbursed, they must be co-signed by the county magistrate, the accounting director, and the property department director to prevent embezzlement.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Boundary Dispute Between Qingpu and Jiading Counties</p>
<p>The county governments of this county and Jiading were ordered to redraw the boundary of the embedded and flying-inserted areas. County Magistrate Qian of this county, based on the resolutions of the district chief meeting and the administrative meeting, proposed that the former Yiqian and Xiangxiang villages of the sixth district of this county be merged into Jiading, and the Xishengxiang village of Ji county be merged into Qingpu. However, Ji County insisted on using the Wusong River as the boundary, and the opinions of the two parties differed. Although the two county magistrates met and surveyed the area, there was no result of the consultation. Jiang Nianci, the chief of the township of the sixth district of this county, presented the situation and opinions to the county government for submission to the provincial office, as the case was unresolved and hindered the progress of self-government. The order No. 8691 of the 8th month contained the phrase: "There are no rivers, roads, or other permanent levees, dykes, bridges, and solid buildings inside and outside the embedded area that can be used to determine a fair boundary." It is now found that there are no levees, dykes, or bridges in the embedded area that can be used to determine a fair boundary. However, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, which crosses the former Zhangzhuang village of the sixth district of this county, is indeed a permanent and solid building. Therefore, various institutions, organizations, and schools have jointly requested that the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway be used as the boundary. The Civil Affairs Department has sent a committee member to Qingpu on the 28th to conduct an on-site survey with the county magistrates of the two counties and the relevant district and township chiefs, in order to make a decision. The committee member has a cold and will implement it as soon as he recovers.</p>

<p>Merchants and People Still Automatically Affix Old Stamps</p>
<p>Merchants and people of this county, because of the Ministry of Finance's circular that on November 1st, newly issued stamps would be sold by the post office and the tax rate increased, causing old stamps to be discarded, greatly affecting the merchants' burden, specially held an emergency meeting yesterday. Before the Ministry of Finance announces methods for exchanging old stamps, they unanimously decided to use old stamps to avoid losses, and sent representatives to the county's chamber of commerce to petition, requesting support from party and beggar gang organizations to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.</p>

<p>Large Numbers of Refugees Plunder Maozhu Bridge</p>
<p>The small village of Maozhu Bridge Township in this county, located near the Nantang River. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday afternoon, several hundred refugees suddenly came by boat across the river. After landing, they wantonly harassed the area. First, they swarmed into the home of Shi Shousheng. At that time, Shi Shousheng happened to be out on business, and only his elderly mother and children were at home. The refugees then wantonly plundered the house and continued to the house of a certain surname next door to plunder. In total, silver dollars, clothes, and other items worth about forty or fifty dollars were stolen. Currently, the villagers have reported to the nearby police team to come to the scene to suppress the situation in order to protect public security.</p>
<p>Zhou Shanbang Fire Injures People</p>
<p>Zhou Shanbang, north of the railway station, has numerous factories, thriving commerce, and a dense population. At around 2 a.m. the night before last, the Heping Teahouse under Xiang Bridge suddenly caught fire. That night, a strong northwest wind suddenly rose, and in an instant, the opposite bank and neighboring shops were affected. Fire brigades from various locations, upon hearing the alarm, rushed to put out the fire. It took about two hours before the fire was extinguished. After investigation, it was estimated that nine shops were burned down, with losses amounting to over 100,000 yuan. Among them, only Yuanfeng Grain Store and Shunchang Sauce Garden had fire insurance. During the intense fire, Zhang Rongsheng, the owner of Maoxing Paper Shop, and his wife, seeing that the stairs had been burned, had no choice but to jump out of the upstairs window, causing serious injuries to their waist and feet. Although they are currently being treated at the Oriental Hospital, they have not yet escaped the danger period. Also, Zhang's father, who is over sixty years old, has been missing since the fire broke out, and his whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>Provincial Committee Secretly Investigates Hua Yuchu Case</p>
<p>Hua Yuchu, who has managed the Wuxi tobacco and alcohol monopoly and tobacco and alcohol license tax for years, was accused by Wang Zuokang, a vendor, to the Anti-Smoking Association of smoking without a license. The association twice sent him to the county's anti-smoking clinic for observation and testing. The result was that he was not addicted. However, Wang Zuokang declared that he was dissatisfied, saying that when Hua was being tested, the anti-smoking clinic gave him cigarettes, supplements, and various foods, and the equipment was incomplete, so it could not be used as evidence. He requested to accompany him to the provincial level for testing and also accused Gu Cengliang, the director of the anti-smoking clinic, to the provincial anti-smoking association of malfeasance, requesting that he be dismissed and severely punished. At the same time, more than 20 people, including Li, also went to the province to file a complaint. The province paid close attention to this case and sent a secret investigator, Yu, to Wuxi for a secret investigation. Yu arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday and investigated various parties, keeping his whereabouts extremely secret.</p>

<p>Five Sailing Boats Robbed Simultaneously</p>
<p>The Shiwudong Bridge area at the junction of Changzhou and Yixing, is the mouth of Lake Ge, sparsely populated and in a remote location, leading to frequent incidents of robbing sailing boats. At about 3 PM on the 1st of this month, five boats, including the Zhaizhai Bridge Passenger Boat, the Yi Ao Express Boat, the Yuting Bridge Passenger Boat, the Heqiao Passenger Boat, and the Yixing Crab Boat, successively departed from outside the West Gate of Changzhou. When passing through the Shiwudong Bridge area at about 6 PM, suddenly 15 or 16 bandits, armed with knives, clubs, and firearms, first cut the tow rope of the Zhaizhai Bridge boat, ordering it to stop. Then, they jumped on board to search and rob. The remaining boats that arrived were also not spared. After about five hours, the bandits fired a gun to show off their power and jumped into a small boat more than ten meters away from the bridge and sailed towards Yahe. Afterwards, the boat owners, finding themselves with nothing, returned to Changzhou and submitted a document to the county government on the 2nd, requesting the water and land police corps to strictly investigate the case within a limited time, to deter the bandits and ensure safe navigation.</p>

<p>County Government Convenes Baojia Meeting</p>
<p>The County Government, upon order, starting from this month, will implement the Baojia system according to the provincial Baojia regulations. The necessary expenses for running the Baojia will be covered by the original self-government funds and local general reserve funds. This county's original self-government fees and household registration fees total more than 40,000 yuan. The total annual Baojia expenses and compilation fees for this year are estimated to be more than 59,000 yuan. After deducting the original self-government funds and household registration fees, the shortfall will be covered by the local general reserve fund. Yesterday (the 2nd), the County Government also convened a meeting of district chiefs from each district to discuss the Baojia. It was decided that (1) The Baojia household registration compiler will be employed by the county after the district chiefs submit their resumes within three days. (2) The county chief will personally visit each district from the 7th to the 13th, convening the public to explain the significance of implementing the Baojia. (3) Compiling household registrations will be piloted in the towns of the urban area of the first district, with all compilation committee members participating to conduct a practical survey. (4) For the Baojia organization, the urban area and prosperous towns will generally have 25 Jia as a Bao (the rest of the plan is omitted).</p>

<p>Levying New Taxes and Clearing Old Grain</p>
<p>The county government of this county, in view of the recent arrival of new grain on the market and farmers paying rent separately, and that the tax for the 23rd year should also be levied, has now decided to set up two counters in the east and west starting from the 3rd of this month to collect taxes. The highest-quality farmland will be taxed at a total of one yuan, two jiao, six fen, seven li per mu, while the lowest will be taxed at over four jiao, five fen, with a three-month limit set. Those who fail to pay within the deadline will be charged a late payment fine of 10% of the amount. As for old taxes, the arrears accumulated over the years amount to 200,000 yuan. Despite repeated efforts to clear and strictly pursue them, no results have been achieved due to famine. The Department of Finance now has a total of more than 8 million yuan in old taxes owed throughout the province since the 16th year. In view of the empty provincial treasury, the provincial government meeting was proposed and approved to separately send personnel to clear the arrears. Chen Youxun, the commissioner who came to this county to clear the arrears last year, will be sent to Changshu to continue the work and assist in collecting the new taxes, with a time limit of four months.</p>
<p>Hengjing Villages Suffered from Plundering</p>
<p>Hengjing Town in the Eighth District is located on the shores of the lake and has always been a place where bandits appear. Fortunately, there was a police team stationed there, so they were able to coexist peacefully. Recently, after the team was reorganized into a security team, the police stationed there were withdrawn, resulting in a defense vacuum. As a result, bandits took the opportunity to cause trouble again. In the last ten days of last month, Sijing Township was robbed as many as four times, and rice boats on the lake were repeatedly robbed. On the night of the 30th of last month, forty or fifty bandits came to the villages of Zhujia Bang and Xiaduan Jing in the town to rob, and no well-off family was spared. The bandits not only paid attention to money but also took away daily household items, such as teapots, orange chairs, and cotton quilts. It is estimated that fourteen households, including Zhang Jingen, were robbed in the two villages, with losses amounting to about 5,000 yuan. The town chief, Shi Yunxuan, has reported this to the county government and requested that a team be sent to station there.</p>

<p>County Government Labels and Opposes Encroachment of Overflowing Beaches</p>
<p>The Changyinsha Yicheng case involves 1,500 mu of beach land in the sixth and seventh Weituan, which was encroached upon by Xu Xiaoxian and others. After investigation by the province and the central government, it was found that it was indeed beach land outside the reported amount and that it should be confiscated and ordered the county government to execute against the property and has now been labeled.</p>
<h3>揚州</h3>
<p>The Department Approves Supplementing Deficits in Granaries</p>
<p>The accumulated grain in this county was previously investigated by Gao Denghai, an official sent by the Department of Civil Affairs to Yangzhou. At that time, it was because the Baoyou Granary in this county only had 3,716 shi and some ling of indica rice, which was still short of the 5,000 shi quota set by the Department. After the autumn rice from the county's educational farmland is collected, they will liaise to purchase enough to meet the quota. As for the previous purchase of rental rice from the Bureau, there is still an outstanding payment of 1,188 yuan, four jiao, five fen, and nine li. The current funds in the county treasury are not enough to repay the old debt. Regarding the new grain purchase price, it is proposed to negotiate with the Bureau of Education to slightly delay the time and still use the continued collection of grain funds as an offset. The case was submitted to the Department for approval. Now that the Department of Civil Affairs has approved it, County Chief Ma ordered the Bureau of Education to report the amount of autumn farmland rental rice harvested this year and how much can be sold to the county government for storage. A committee will decide on the detailed method of grain price evaluation so that it can be followed, and the Bureau Chief will be notified to attend the meeting when the time comes.</p>
<h3>睢寗</h3>
<p>Suining Daily News Ceases Publication</p>
<p>The Suining Daily News Agency, due to the impact of the political turmoil, suffered a lot of damage to its type, making typesetting difficult. Moreover, the people's literacy level was too low, and the proofreading was too careless, resulting in repeated errors, which affected the newspaper's sales. Since the new Party Consolidation Committee member Chen Qixin concurrently assumed the position of president, he has been actively refreshing the newspaper's content and form. A notice was issued on October 30th to cease publication to facilitate the reorganization of everything, and it will resume publication as soon as the reorganization is complete.</p>
<p>Letters</p>
<h3>Letter from Lu Jingmo, Director of the Education Bureau of Changshu County</h3>
<p>To the Editor of Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper:</p>
<p>I have recently read an article in the Local Correspondence column of your newspaper on October 31st, entitled "Disputes over the Allocation of Funds by the Changshu Education Bureau." After investigation, the facts are not true. The County Government's Order No. 373 forwarded the Education Department's Directive No. 10490, stating that due to the prolonged drought in this county during the summer, the educational expenses for the 23rd year will be disbursed at 90% across the board. It clearly states that [Schools from August of this year to the end of July of the 20th year, and the Education Bureau and social education institutions from July of this year to the end of June of the 24th year, will be limited to twelve months each. If there are any cases where the full amount has already been disbursed, the difference should be deducted in installments before December] and so on. Jingmo believes that this method is a focal point of dispute. He has already clearly stated that the previous director, Ge, left office at the end of July. Old personnel have already left and gone elsewhere. Two personnel in my tenure have also been reassigned. If the deduction is made from the salaries of those who have succeeded them, how can things be fair? As for personnel from various schools and institutions who have left and gone to other jobs, it is also difficult to ask them to return the money. The reason is to take into account the difficult situation of various schools and institutions and to do my best to appeal. Moreover, the county treasury system is now implemented, and all funds are easily tracked, and monthly reports are made. If there are no receipts from various schools and institutions, how can there be any deception? However, there are those with ulterior motives who have taken things out of context and misrepresented the facts, claiming that there is suspicion of deceiving superiors. If the 90% disbursement had not started from October, in accordance with the confirmed case of the austerity budget for the 20th year, then it would have been known that the schools and museums would have found it difficult to disburse in full for the months of July, August and September. Jingmo feels no shame in handling this case, both in terms of reason and emotion, and the local people also understand it very well. I hope that the county chief will know about this and call up the documents of this bureau for review. It also shows that someone has come to the bureau to check the accounts. Where did this rumor come from? Also, the previous director borrowed 10,000 yuan from the Bank of China, and the repayment period expired in August. To maintain credit, I specially allocated 10,000 yuan on September 7 to repay the old debt. The facts are clear and can easily be verified. I have always known that your newspaper's reports are detailed and its reputation is outstanding. This news item was probably contributed by your newspaper's Changshu reporter without careful consideration. I am deeply afraid that misinformation will be spread, so I specially request a correction. I respectfully send my regards. Lu Jingmo, Director of the Education Bureau of Changshu County, November 2nd.</p>
<p>Special Document</p>
<h3>Work Report of the Document Library of the National Beiping Palace Museum</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The historical materials collected by this library are mainly Qing Dynasty archives, which are numerous in volumes and diverse in types. Among them, there are many important events and rare news, but also ordinary and commonplace documents. If these are classified and synthesized, they can provide material for historians. Moreover, the politics, laws, economics, customs, and habits recorded in the archives of a dynasty can always reflect the general culture of the country and society at that time. The degree of their importance varies depending on the perspective of the researcher. Therefore, even fragmented pieces can be explored, and there should be no prejudice.</p>
<p>In the past, this library has also compiled and published some important materials related to Qing history. However, they were all piecemeal, so there were many omissions. The drawback was the eagerness to seek results without waiting for the completion of basic work and comprehensive sorting. This led to impatience and a lack of success. The library, seeing this, decided on a method after this reorganization, focusing on comprehensive sorting with all its strength. It divided the existing historical materials in Beiping, the memoranda and telegrams of the Grand Council, the yellow registers and archives of the Grand Secretariat, and the various archives of the Imperial Household Department into several groups, which were sorted simultaneously, first classified by name, and then cataloged by class.</p>
<p>However, sorting archives is very different from sorting books. Books are based on entire volumes, while archives are based on scattered pages. This is the first difference. There are established rules for classifying books in China and the West, but there are no fixed rules for archives. This is the second difference. There are titles to classify books, but archives must be classified by subject matter (many original subjects are not applicable). This is the third difference. Therefore, in terms of classification, one must first consider the affiliations of the officials and the duties of the yamen. In terms of cataloging, one must first study the format of official documents and the terminology of archives. All of these things, in addition to exploring the archives themselves, must also be cross-referenced with classics and inquired of elders in order to complete this basic work as soon as possible. (The archives of the Southern Transport should also be sorted according to this principle.) Then, following the style of historical records, the cases of major events in the Qing Dynasty will be compiled into an index by event and subject, to be used as a chronicle for revising Qing history, for the reference of historians. As for the materials discovered during the sorting process, they will still be selected and published by the Document Compilation Department at any time, in order to arouse the interest of researchers.</p>

This disaster relief drill was initiated and prepared by the Songhu Garrison Command and the Shanghai Municipal Government. Prior to the drill, the military police organs under their jurisdiction and public organizations were convened several times for meetings to discuss and formulate the drill plan. Last night, the drill was carried out according to the prescribed plan. During the drill, electricity and telephone services were completely cut off in all drill areas. Participating organizations enthusiastically set off to implement disaster relief work, continuing until dawn at six o'clock. Although the disaster relief drill was held for the first time, the results were excellent. Details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>From 12:30 AM, after the Garrison Command issued an emergency alert order, the Southeast District Headquarters received the order and immediately instructed all units to deploy. The first project carried out was flood relief and rescue. Yi Zuanren, the Chief of the Dongjiadu Police Station, led squad leaders Guo Shaorong, Liu Xiufeng, Guo Gengchong, Jiang Hongyuan, and over a hundred police officers and servants in carrying out rescue work at Pier 17. First, sandbags and sand were moved to the vicinity of the pier. The sand was then placed into sandbags, and servants used poles to carry them to the riverbank, stacking them one by one. By 3:00 AM, the sandbags had been stacked into a high bank, approximately 50 meters long and one meter high. Guan Gong, the Chief of the Shiliupu branch, personally went to the scene around 2:00 AM to supervise the rescue. Evaluators were also on site to monitor.</p>
<p>Suppression of Riots</p>
<p>At the same time, all police officers in the Hunan District, upon receiving the emergency alert order, immediately began searching for reactionary elements. Fifty reactionary elements, with red cloth wrapped around their arms, had secretly dispersed throughout the city in advance. Police officers at each police station paid close attention to pedestrians along the way, questioning them. The reactionary elements gathered near the Public Security Bureau, intending to riot and storm into the Municipal Public Security Bureau. However, they were discovered by the police and suppressed. Around 2:00 AM, about twenty people were found and sent to the district for detention. By around 4:00 AM, all had been captured, so no unexpected incidents occurred.</p>
<p>Arrest of Wanted Criminals</p>
<p>Three wanted criminals were hiding in various district stations under the Ximen branch. After receiving the order to arrest the wanted criminals at 3:00 AM, all police officers immediately began to mobilize and search. The wanted criminals fled east and west by car, making their whereabouts uncertain, making capture difficult. However, the police officers acted swiftly and, by around 4:00 AM, had captured all of them and escorted them to their superiors.</p>
<p>Northwest District</p>
<p>Participating Organizations</p>
<p>On the western front, the headquarters was located at the regimental headquarters of the Second Regiment of the Municipal Security Team on Jinji Road. The commander was Qi Xueqi. Participating organizations included the Second Regiment of the Security Team, led by Commander Qi, the Caojiadu branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, led by Chief Wang Dasui, the Xujiahui Police Station of the Public Security Bureau, led by Hong Zhen, the Pusong Police Station, led by Dong Pingxing, the Pusong District Security Corps, led by Wang Tongfu, the Fahua District Security Corps, led by Li Chao, the Tenth Team of the Hunan District He Wei Corps, led by Zhou Chengxiang, the Fudan University Boy Scout Corps, led by Leng Xueqiao, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, led by Liu Yongcang, the Shenxin First Factory, led by Ji Jinwen, the Caojiadu Fire Brigade, led by Yu Yuqing, the Second Platoon of the Security Team, led by Wu Chuanxin, the Third Platoon of the Security Team, led by Zhou Tianjian, and the Mortar Company of the Security Team, led by Wang Daihu.</p>
<p>Increased Deployment of Beat Cops</p>
<p>The western district is extremely broad, with a sparse population, and factories abound in the area. Should a disaster occur, disaster prevention would naturally be more difficult. Therefore, more attention had to be paid to disaster prevention work. During the disaster prevention exercise last night, the defense of the area was also given great attention. At each intersection in the western district of Shanghai, beat cops were added starting at 12:00 AM, watching carefully. Pedestrians and vehicles were all subject to inspection, and were allowed to pass only after detailed questioning. Near Zhongshan First Bridge, the deployment of beat cops was even denser.</p>
<p>Bridge Construction</p>
<p>The western district's disaster prevention exercise focused on repairing traffic routes. The location was Zhongshan Road First Bridge in the jurisdiction of the Xujiahui Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The duty inspectors were Tang Hong and Wang Zongjun. The demonstration time was around 3:00 AM this morning. Some members of each participating organization departed from the regimental headquarters of the Second Regiment of the Security Team on Jinji Road by car, one after another, starting around 2:00 AM. Because of the long distance, transportation took a longer time. They gradually gathered around 2:30 AM. Police officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau were responsible for security around the bridge. The Municipal Security Team and the troops of each participating organization dispatched patrols to prevent troublemakers. Bridge construction was carried out by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. The bridge being constructed was next to the First Bridge. Two military doctors were sent to the scene to prevent workers from being injured during the work. The river surface of the bridge was about 20 meters wide, so construction was completed in just over half an hour. Each disaster relief worker acted swiftly and achieved good results.</p>
<p>Elementary School Collapse</p>
<p>At 12:35 AM, Xinmin Elementary School in Yongxiang Lane, Datong Road, Zhabei, suddenly collapsed. The Security Team and the Public Security Bureau branch received the news and immediately sent teams to provide aid. At the same time, hygiene teams, Boy Scouts, and student teams arrived to provide rescue. Twelve students were seriously injured and twenty were slightly injured. The Boy Scout teams formed groups and used stretchers to carry them one by one to the ambulances sent by the Red Cross Hospital. They were transported to the Xinmin Road Pushen Hospital and the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. After bandaging, the seriously injured were hospitalized, and the slightly injured were escorted home. When the accident occurred, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau branch, Gong Xi, You Luohua of the Hygiene Office, and Bao Qitong, an attaché of the Security Team, all went to the scene to direct and instruct the military police to maintain order.</p>
<p>Fire in Zhabei</p>
<p>Then, at 12:40 AM, a fire broke out in Taishan Lane on Qingyun Road. The nearby Fourth Fire Brigade arrived first after receiving the alarm to extinguish the fire. Subsequently, fire engines from the First, Second, and Third Brigades also arrived one after another. The Security Team, the Public Security Bureau, and the Security Office each dispatched a small team to the scene to maintain order. Some of the Boy Scouts who were providing aid on Datong Road had also rushed to assist in rescuing the injured. At the time, four residents were awakened from their sleep and, in a moment of panic, jumped from the front windows of the second floor. Fortunately, the fire brigade had prepared a safety net, and those who jumped suffered only minor injuries. They were assisted by the Boy Scouts and escorted to the ambulance for treatment at Pushen Hospital. Those directing on the scene at the time included Fire Brigade Captain Wu Baoyu, Chief of the Public Security Bureau branch Liang Fuchu, and Sheng Jun, an attaché of the Security Team, so order was maintained.</p>
<p>Rescue of the Injured</p>
<p>Around 1:20 AM this morning, the Zhabei ambulance patrolled to the North Railway Station. There were onlookers by the iron fence on Baoshan Road, North Shanxi Road. The Security Team and the police of the Fifth District maintained order and did not allow them to enter. At the time, a man resembling a painter suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness. The police called for the ambulance to stop, and the doctor and others got out of the car to provide aid. They quickly carried him into the car and drove him to the temporary hospital of the Chinese Red Cross on Heping Road for treatment. By the time they arrived at the hospital, he had already died.</p>
<p>Commander's Inspection</p>
<p>Accompanying Personnel</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai and Commander of the Songhu Garrison, arrived at the Longhua Garrison Command at 11 PM last night. At 12:30 AM this morning, he issued orders for an emergency martial law in the city and for the military police to mobilize for disaster relief. Then, at 12:40 AM, accompanied by Deputy Chief Judge Ting An, Secretary Huang Jianfen, Luo Weixiong, Chief of the Staff Office of the Garrison Command, and Gan Hailan, Chief of the Adjutant Office, he set out to inspect disaster relief work.</p>
<p>Inspection Details</p>
<p>Wu departed from the Garrison Command, turned into Jiaotong Road via Zhongshan Road, and arrived at Gonghe Road to inspect the rescue work. He summoned Gong Xi to inquire about everything. Then he boarded a car, crossed the Zhuxiangchang New Bridge, and entered the concession. He proceeded to Dongjiadu via Xinzha Road, Xizang Road, Minguo Road, and Zhonghua Road. He personally got out of the car to direct flood relief work until 2:30 AM. He then boarded the car again and went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to inspect the suppression of riots. Finally, he returned to Zhongshan Road First Bridge to inspect traffic repair work until dawn before returning to his private residence on Haige Road to rest.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Remarks</p>
<p>Mayor Wu, at 10 AM this morning, after attending the tenth-anniversary celebration of Great China University, went to the Municipal Government to meet with reporters from various newspapers and made the following remarks. The first disaster relief drill in the city was held from 12:30 AM last night until dawn. The scope and methods have been announced and are well known, so there is no need to repeat them. However, this drill was held for the first time, so all methods and scope are very simple. The purpose of this drill is to provide an opportunity for all officers of the city's military police organizations and public organizations to practice disaster relief knowledge and skills and to develop disaster relief habits, so that they can cope with disasters with ease. He sincerely hoped that all citizens of the city would cooperate fully.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun's Remarks</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters interviewed Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. According to Yu, the most important purpose of this disaster relief drill is to test whether citizens can cooperate effectively with the government to cope with any unexpected events. Therefore, it is extremely important. However, since it is a pioneering undertaking, it is impossible to expect complete satisfaction. Overall, it is hoped that after this examination, efforts can be made to remedy any shortcomings, as it is not too late. We, in light of the unprecedented storm disaster suffered by Japan this time, still feel chilled to the bone when we think about it. If that storm had not changed direction and had struck our country's coastal areas directly, then without prior preparation, the disaster would have been even more unimaginable. In this disaster relief drill, in addition to testing the degree of cooperation between the people and the government, the main reason is also to determine whether personnel can fully cope with such unexpected events. Therefore, during this drill, large numbers of evaluators were hired to go out and inspect. Excellent results are naturally unremarkable, but those who perform poorly must be punished.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Says Wang and Chiang Both Hope Hu Hanmin Will Come North</h3>
<p>Gives a Speech at the YMCA in the Evening on the Fundamental Problems of the Constitution</p>
<p>Lists Six Key Points to Elucidate the Spirit of Our Constitution</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:20 AM on an overnight train from Beijing. At 11:00 AM, he received a group of reporters at his residence. At 7:30 PM last night, Mr. Sun was invited by the YMCA to give a speech entitled "Several Problems of the Chinese Constitution." The details of Mr. Sun's remarks are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chiang and Wang Hope Mr. Hu Will Come North</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, Mr. Sun received a group of reporters at his residence. According to Mr. Sun, Wang Chonghui is traveling north and south this time, visiting comrades in various quarters to exchange opinions on the current situation in order to seek national unity. Chairman Chiang and President Wang both hope that Mr. Hu Zhantang will leave Hong Kong and come north to meet in Shanghai or Nanjing to discuss everything in person. However, Mr. Hu has not yet expressed his intentions on this matter. Fortunately, the Fifth National Congress has already decided to postpone its opening, and during this postponement, satisfactory negotiations should be possible. As for whether Mr. Wang Chonghui will go south again, it has not yet been heard.</p>
<p>Draft Constitution Submitted to the Central Government</p>
<p>After the entire draft constitution was passed, it has now been submitted to the National Government and forwarded to the Central Government. It is scheduled to be promulgated in April next year after being passed by the National Assembly. Now that the Fifth National Congress has been postponed, the National Assembly will naturally be postponed accordingly. Therefore, it is expected that the promulgation of the constitution will be no earlier than the fall of next year.</p>
<p>Criminal Law and Civil Law Have Been Passed</p>
<p>The Criminal Law and the Civil Law have been passed by the General Assembly of the Legislative Yuan. The Criminal Procedure Law can also be submitted for discussion within two weeks. It is expected that it will be completed by the end of this month. After the Criminal Procedure Law is completed, the Civil Procedure Law will also be submitted for discussion immediately afterward. Once passed, it can be promulgated. The date of implementation is expected to be in the spring of next year, as it takes three to four months for promulgation so that courts at all levels across the country can prepare. The Bankruptcy Law is also being drafted. This law is still a pioneering undertaking in our country, as it has never existed before. It is expected that it can be submitted to the General Assembly of the Legislative Yuan for discussion next year.</p>
<p>Speech on Constitutional Issues Last Night</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM last night, Mr. Chen was invited by the YMCA to give a speech entitled "Several Fundamental Problems of the Chinese Constitution." Hundreds of people attended, and the hall was full before 7:00 PM. The gist of Mr. Sun's speech was roughly as follows: What I am going to talk about today are several fundamental problems of the Chinese Constitution. This topic covers a very broad range and cannot be covered in a short time. Now I will just briefly mention a few key points. (1) It is necessary to determine that China is a country of the Three Principles of the People. The constitutions of European and American countries must first determine that they are a certain country. The Chinese Constitution, in its opening remarks, determines that it is a country of the Three Principles of the People. Only when China is a national country can it avoid oppression by imperialism, help weak and small nations, and ensure the survival of all people, and achieve democracy, government by the people, and government for the people. (2) Guarantee the freedom and rights of the people and stipulate their obligations. Although the constitution cannot contain concrete and detailed articles on this, it must determine the principles. However, after the draft was promulgated, various sectors have expressed much opposition, believing that the protection is insufficient. In fact, the spirit of legislation cannot only focus on individual rights, but should focus on the interests of the entire nation. The suffering we are experiencing now is due to the lack of the rule of law. After the constitution is established, the people will have their full reasons within the scope of the law. (3) China's constitution is a five-power constitution, with political power and governing power clearly defined. In the future, after the constitution is established, although a presidential system with centralized power will be adopted, it cannot be dictatorial, as political power is still in the hands of the National Assembly representing the people. (4) Solve the problem of the central government and local authorities. The provinces of China are different from the states of the United States and the states of Germany. The United States and Germany first had states before uniting to form a country. The provinces of our country are administrative regions of the central government. After the constitution establishes the provincial and county system, it must ensure that there are no more divisions, so as to consolidate the permanent strength of the family. (5) Unify military power. If military power is not unified, the country cannot fundamentally exist. (6) Unify the economic unit and determine its system. Economic problems are currently very important. In our country, in addition to tariffs, it is even reported that several provinces are implementing protective taxes on domestic goods imported from outside the province. If these non-unified phenomena become a reality, how will the national economy develop?</p>
<h3>All Banks Sign Contract for Jiangsu Provincial Public Bond Loan</h3>

<p>Loan to Be Disbursed in Equal Monthly Installments Over Ten Months Starting This Month</p>

The total amount is 7.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Contract Signed</p>
<p>After the mortgage loan contract was negotiated by Xu Baoying, General Manager of Jiangsu Bank, and the banking syndicate formed by the borrowing banks, it has now been drafted. Hou Houpei, a secretary of the Jiangsu Department of Finance, came to Shanghai to sign a general contract together with Xu, General Manager of Jiangsu Bank, starting this past Tuesday. Party A is the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, and Party B is the syndicate of banks mortgaging Jiangsu Province's Water Conservancy Construction Bonds. The signing has now been completed. Hou Houpei carried it back to Zhenjiang the day before yesterday, and after Zhao, the director, signs it, it will be sent to the borrowing banks for safekeeping and reference.</p>
<p>Loan Disbursement Method</p>
<p>The contract stipulates that the interest rate is 8% and the term is two years. March and September of each year are the dates for drawing lots, repaying principal, and paying interest on the public bonds, which are also the dates for paying interest and repaying principal on the mortgage loan. According to the loan disbursement method, one-tenth of the loan will be disbursed each month starting in November of the 23rd year, and the disbursement will be completed in ten months, i.e., 750,000 yuan should be disbursed each month, which will be handled by the banking syndicate. The borrowing banks may elect two representatives, and the money dealers may elect one representative, to participate as members of the Water Conservancy Construction Expenditure Supervision Committee. The committee has three standing committee members, and the three committee members from the banking and money industries may serve as one of the standing committee members.</p>
<p>Agreement Reached on Recovery</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government pledged public bonds with a face value of 1 million yuan to the Central Bank for a loan of 500,000 yuan. The interest rate, term, etc. have all been agreed upon, and the contract has also been signed. Also, it used public bonds with a face value of 2 million yuan to recover the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Bonds previously mortgaged to Shanghai's Bank of China and other banks. The Department of Finance has reached an agreement with the Shanghai banks. Once the public bonds are printed, the recovery will be implemented.</p>
<p>Collect Pre-Subscription Certificates</p>
<p>After the Jiangsu Provincial Public Bonds are issued, pre-subscription certificates will be issued first, and they will be exchanged after the public bonds are printed. These pre-subscription certificates, worth 12.5 million yuan, will be filled out and handed over to the borrowing syndicate for safekeeping, and then submitted to the banks for storage. It is said that the syndicate is affiliated with the Bank of China and Bank of Communications, and is managed by the above two banks. It is also heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Public Bonds will be printed by Shanghai's Datong Book Company.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Provincial Government Reaches Agreement with Shanghai Banks on Jinghui Irrigation Loan</h3>
<p>Total Amount of 1.5 Million Yuan; Contract to Be Signed</p>
<p>Irrigation Dues from Jinghui Canal and Luohui Canal to Be Used as Security</p>
<p>Yang Hucheng, Director of the Shaanxi Relief and Pacification Office, in view of the years of drought and disaster, specially appointed Lei Baohua, Director of the Department of Construction, to come to Shanghai at the end of last month to contact the banking industry and negotiate a loan contract for dredging.</p>
<p>Loan Agreement Reached</p>
<p>Since Director Lei arrived in Shanghai, he has contacted Zhang Gongquan, Zou Bingwen, and Hu Yunqi of banks including Shanghai's Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Jincheng Bank, Dalu Bank, Zhongnan Bank, and Jianye Bank. The loan amount, etc. has now been agreed upon. The total amount is 1.5 million yuan, designated for use in the Jinghui irrigation project, with irrigation dues as security. Director Lei has now wired the Shaanxi Provincial Government to send the method for collecting irrigation dues to Shanghai by airmail.</p>
<p>Irrigation Dues as Security</p>
<p>The collateral for the Jinghui Irrigation Loan is the irrigation dues collected from the land irrigated along the Jinghui Canal and the Luohui Canal in Shaanxi Province. The Shaanxi Province will collect the irrigation dues for the purpose of repaying the principal and interest. It is estimated that the Jing Canal irrigates approximately 500,000 mu of land, and the Luohui Canal, built by the National Economic Commission, irrigates approximately 500,000 mu of land along its line.</p>
<p>Contract to Be Signed</p>
<p>The borrowing banks, including Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Shanghai Bank, have decided to formally sign the contract after the Shaanxi Provincial Government's method for collecting irrigation dues arrives in Shanghai. The method has now been sent to Shanghai by airmail and is expected to arrive next Tuesday. After the borrowing banks study it, the contract can be formally signed. According to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, the method for collecting irrigation dues stipulates that it will be 5 jiao per mu.</p>
<p>Named Jinghui Canal</p>
<p>After the contract is signed, the Jinghui irrigation project will begin construction immediately. When completed in the future, it will be named the Jinghui Canal. Irrigation dues will be collected from the land irrigated along the line. After the principal and interest on the Jinghui Irrigation Loan are repaid, the Shanghai banking industry will be contacted again to borrow money to dredge other rivers, with irrigation dues as security. The amount of the loan can naturally be increased. Within a few years, the water conservancy of the entire Shaanxi Province will be successful.</p>
<h3>Jiaxu Quanzhe Relief Association Resolves to Expedite Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>Sends Letter to Zhejiang Relief Affairs Association to Discuss Methods</p>
<p>Association Replies in Detail to Each Item in the Letter</p>
<p>The Jiaxu Quanzhe Relief Association previously sent a letter to the Zhejiang Relief Affairs Association regarding the expedited handling of emergency relief. The association has now replied to each item in the letter as follows:</p>
<p>Review of Disaster Situation</p>
<p>(1) The severity of the disaster in each county should be based on the drought disaster investigation form filled out by the county of the Survey Committee. Currently, only five or six counties have submitted this investigation form. In order to urgently investigate the disaster situation in each county, this association has used the private reports of each committee member as a basis for review, one by one. It should be completed soon. After the review is completed, a list of the severity of the disaster will be submitted separately.</p>
<p>Procurement of Relief Grain</p>
<p>(2) The 28th Standing Committee meeting of this association resolved to handle winter relief in advance instead of changing it to emergency relief. Mr. Han Zhixue has been appointed to go to Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places to procure relief grain. Once the severity of the disaster is determined, the names of the relief directors will be listed, and your association will be notified to jointly investigate and distribute the relief grain with our association.</p>
<p>Requesting Allocation of Relief Funds</p>
<p>(3) The Provincial Government Committee has now resolved to allocate 1.1 million yuan from the 23rd year local public bonds for use in labor relief and disaster relief. After the 28th Standing Committee meeting of this association, it was resolved to first submit a request to allocate 2 million yuan for winter relief. At the same time, the China Bank of Hangzhou was consulted to advance 150,000 yuan, which, together with the original 50,000 yuan, totals 200,000 yuan to procure relief grain to avoid delays. However, the amount of relief grain to be distributed in each county must wait until the relief directors go to each place to investigate each household and use the number of people who cannot survive without relief as the standard, and not engage in distribution in advance to avoid disputes and show fairness.</p>
<p>Distribution of Seeds</p>
<p>(4) The method for addressing the shortage of relief funds in Jiaxing has been discussed by Committee Member Zhang Xuelian of this association in a separate letter to Committee Member Chu Huiseng. In addition, for the need for relief in the Tong two counties, this association has decided to holistically plan for the procurement of cotton clothing. After it is procured, it will be handled in the same way as the relief grain. Spring cultivation seeds have been procured by the Department of Construction and will be distributed directly.</p>

<h3>Grand Tea Party at the Kong Residence Last Night</h3>
<p>Welcoming Mrs. Theodore of the American Red Cross</p>
<p>Attended by over One Hundred and Twenty Chinese and Western Dignitaries</p>
<p>Mrs. Theodore, President of the American Red Cross and Executive Committee Member of the China Child Welfare Association of America, arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo, Japan, and was warmly received by all sectors. President Kong Xiangxi specifically held a grand tea party at his residence on Avenue Sayes to warmly welcome the Chinese and Western dignitaries present. Multiple guards were stationed at the entrance for strict protection. For a time, Avenue Sayes was filled with cars like shuttles and guests as numerous as clouds. Inside the venue, Xu Jianping, Chen Tiesheng, Wang Chengmei, Chen Zhengfan, Zhang Yueru, Liu Yide, Ding Bingnan, Jiang Zhuoying, Xia Shi, and others acted as hosts. Attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Gu Weijun, Xu Shiying, Xiong Xiling, Zhu Ziqiao (Cha Liangjian), Mr. and Mrs. Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan (representing He Xiya), Xue Dubi, Cao Yunxiang, Zhang Gongquan, Qu Wenliu, Zhao Jinqing, Luo Yunyan, Xu Weizhen, Wen Yuqing, Hu Mengjia, Huang Hanzhi, Yan Fuqing, Li Jin, Yan Nanzhang, Jiang Xiufeng, Ms. Li Guanfang, Ms. Yang Yan Yun, Mr. and Mrs. Chen Liting, Mr. and Mrs. Liu Zhanen, Mr. and Mrs. Wu Weide, Mr. and Mrs. Sun Ruihuang, Mr. and Mrs. Bei Songsun, Mr. and Mrs. Sun Zhongli, Mr. and Mrs. Qiao Fusan, U.S. Consul General to Shanghai Mr. Ke Yinhang, U.S. Shanghai Assessor Mr. and Mrs. Hermanek, President of St. John's University Bu Fangji, Mr. and Mrs. Baker of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, General Manager of Reiss &amp; Co. Mr. and Mrs. Laurenge, General Manager of U.S. Steel Corporation Mr. and Mrs. Rieber, Manager of British American Tobacco Mr. Bersot, and over one hundred and twenty others. During the tea gathering, Kong Xiangxi delivered a welcoming speech, stating that Mrs. Theodore is a social worker from the United States and has spared no effort in supporting China's child welfare endeavors. Her visit to Shanghai is something we must greet with the warmest welcome. At the same time, I wish her a pleasant journey and request her generous guidance. Mrs. Theodore then responded, stating that she represented the American Red Cross at the World Red Cross Conference held in Tokyo, Japan. After the conference, she particularly made a return visit to Shanghai because she longed to meet with Chinese and Western friends. She felt that everything in Shanghai was more advanced than before, and she was deeply grateful for the generous treatment from everyone. Shanghai's municipal administration, under the leadership of Mayor Wu, has already achieved significant success. Furthermore, she was delighted to hear from President Kong about the progress of the China Child Welfare Association, which convened a national child welfare leaders' conference in Shanghai on the tenth of last month, with over one hundred and forty representatives from various regions attending and passing over seventy important proposals, all of which will be implemented. This particularly fills her with great interest and joy. After returning to her country, she will certainly share the progress here with the American people. At the same time, she wishes everyone even greater success and a final victory, adding that China's future is undoubtedly limitless. Following this, all attendees came forward one by one to shake hands with Mrs. Theodore and express their respects. The hosts and guests enjoyed a happy gathering, which ended at six o'clock, when the city was already lit up with countless lights.</p>
<h3>Grand Celebration of the Second Anniversary of Shanghai National Products Company</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu and His Wife Accompanied by Women's Leaders</p>
<p>Ms. Lin Kecong Broadcast and Visited</p>
<p>Shanghai National Products Company, located opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road in this city, has been praised by all sectors for its genuine goods and fair prices since its founding by Mr. Wu Zhihao and Mr. Lu Qisheng. Therefore, its business is extremely prosperous. Yesterday marked the company's second anniversary, and it specially invited renowned figures from Shanghai, such as Yu Zuoting, Yuan Lvdeng, Zheng Zhengqiu, Hong Yanbin, and famous artists, to broadcast. Mayor Wu and his wife, accompanied by women's leaders Ms. Lin Kecong, Ms. Min Zhuyi, Miss Ma, and others, personally went to broadcast and visited various departments of the company. General Manager Wu Zhihao personally hosted them, and they praised the internal facilities as perfect. They left in high spirits around 3:00 PM. The speeches of Mayor Wu and the response from Mr. Wu are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng spoke about the significance of the national products movement, saying, "Our nation is now extremely weak, and our country is extremely dangerous. Why have our nation and country become so dangerous and weak? That is naturally due to constant internal troubles and external threats. Internal troubles are due to our own misplanning, and external threats are the aggression imposed upon us by imperialism. Imperialist aggression is political on the one hand and economic on the other. Political aggression, such as the seizure of territory, is a tangible aggression. Economic aggression, such as the dumping of goods and the transplantation of capital, is an intangible aggression. From the long-term perspective of a country, intangible aggression is sometimes more terrible than tangible aggression. For example, if someone occupies our territory, we naturally feel righteous indignation and strive to recover the lost land. However, our annual trade deficit of seven to eight hundred million yuan, such as the surplus of 388,964,000 yuan in the 18th year of the Republic, the surplus of 646,430,000 yuan in the 19th year of the Republic, the surplus of 816,410,000 yuan in the 20th year of the Republic, the surplus of 867,190,000 yuan in the 21st year of the Republic, and the surplus of 733,730,000 yuan in the 22nd year of the Republic, in these short five years, our country's trade surplus has reached 3,453,440,000 yuan. This is the economic loss to our national economy. With a total population of 470 million, each of us loses an average of almost eight yuan. What a huge number this is, what an alarming number this is. The loss of territory, in terms of an individual, is like the mutilation of limbs, while the financial exhaustion and economic crisis caused by the trade surplus and economic aggression is no different from a person's vital energy being cut off. We certainly want to find ways to recover from the mutilation of limbs, but can we let the injury of vital energy end without treatment? Naturally, we must find ways to save it. How do we save it? I think that is to promote the national products movement. The significance of the national products movement is to enable our 470 million compatriots to directly and indirectly participate in the production of national products and implement the consumption of national products in order to achieve economic independence and seek national rejuvenation. Therefore, the national products movement is both a national product consumption movement and a national product production movement. The national products movement is a national economic independence movement, and the national products movement is a national rejuvenation movement. Anyone who loves the country and the nation has the necessity to participate in the national products movement, and everyone has the national obligation to work hard for the national products movement. Why do we say that the national products movement is a national product production movement? The competition between countries is the competition between national power and national power. What is national power? National power is manpower plus material resources, financial resources, and organizational power. Material resources and financial resources are also economic power, so the competition between countries is mainly the competition of economic power. Why was the British Empire the hegemon of the 18th and 19th centuries? That is because of the advancement of British industry, and London was the world's factory. The United States was not a very strong country in the 18th and 19th centuries. Why has it become the pride of the 20th century? That is because the United States' industry has seen rapid development before and after the European War. In recent years, why does everyone, whether opposing or protecting her, have to look at Japan with new eyes? That is because Japan's industry and commerce have seen amazing development in recent years. Conversely, why do we Chinese always feel the sadness of being invaded? That is naturally because we are exploited economically, so we are dominated politically. In other words, it is precisely because of the bankruptcy of our domestic rural areas, the backwardness of industry, the decline of productivity, and the weakness of economic power that we have suffered this severe pain of losing land. Therefore, if we do not want to establish ourselves in the world, then so be it. Otherwise, we must use great determination and great perseverance to support national unity, develop national industry, first maintain the existing light industry, and second develop heavy industry, such as the steel industry and the machinery industry. What is especially important is that we must find ways to complete the independence of the manufacturing industry of daily necessities such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. If the manufacturing of daily necessities cannot be independent, then it is a loss to the national economy in peacetime and a risk of being locked down by the enemy in wartime. Therefore, I believe that China's national products movement should be a national product production movement. We must develop the production of national products in order to enrich the country's national power and protect the country's survival. Why do we say that the national products movement is a national product consumption movement? Consumption and production are relative. The purpose of production is consumption. What is consumption? Consumption is the satisfaction of our human material desires. Naturally, without the production of national products, there is no way to love and use national products. Conversely, if there is only the production of national products, and there are no patriotic merchants or patriotic people to promote and purchase national products, then the effectiveness of the national products movement will naturally be bleak. If a person relies on others for everything in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, then this person is not progressive. If a country relies on foreign countries for everything in terms of consumption, then this country is a bankrupt country that does not deserve to survive. Therefore, I believe that we should establish a serious concept, that is, everyone's ordinary consumption behavior is related to the prosperity and decline of the national fortune. Even if the expenditure is only one penny, because if you buy foreign goods, then this penny will unknowingly flow to foreign countries. This penny flowing to foreign countries first means an increase in the import of foreign goods, which in a country with a trade deficit like China is an increase in the trade deficit. Second, it means the outflow of productive capital. Since foreign goods are in surplus, what do we rely on to offset the loss of international balance of payments? Naturally, only the export of cash. The export of cash is the flight of capital, which is a terrible loss to the national economy. Third, it means a reduction in domestic job opportunities, which is an increase in unemployment. Capital is an essential element for colonizing industry and commerce. The society must have emerging enterprises, and then those with working abilities will have the opportunity to serve themselves. Now that capital flows out due to the surplus, then the benefit of this capital naturally goes to foreign workers, and our Chinese workers will not be threatened by unemployment. The loss of buying a penny of foreign goods is so serious. We must understand this profound reason before we feel that buying foreign goods is a shameful thing. This sentence is not an empty emotional argument, but it has a full economic meaning. Naturally, I am not an economic isolationist, but I feel that in this time of economic national crisis, the government should adopt a policy of supporting industry, and the people should have the determination to promote national products. We must promote national products with one heart from the government and the people, then the national products movement will have a day of development and prosperity, and the nation and the country will have a day of glorious revival. My words are finished."</p>
<p>Wu Zhihao's Words of Thanks</p>
<p>General Manager Wu Zhihao said in his words of thanks, "Today is the second anniversary of our company, and we are grateful to Mayor Wu for his presence to speak on the significance of the national products movement. We are grateful to Mr. Yu Zuoting, Yu Zhilao, Yuan Lvdeng, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Hong Yanbin for their speeches promoting the doctrine of national products and the use of national products. We are also grateful to Ms. Lin Kecong for promoting the purpose of women using national products. We are extremely grateful. Our company has been open for two weeks, and we are grateful to gentlemen and ladies from all walks of life for their strong support and continuous patronage. Major factories supply exquisite products. The doctrine that our company embraces is to economically support industry, industry to seek production, and production to benefit people's livelihoods, so that rural areas can be revived, industry can be developed, the country can be prosperous and strong, and talents will not be unemployed. We hope that all shops in the city will promote national products and that people from all walks of life will happily use national products in order to seek the benefits of continuous development and mutual support. The industrial sector should study the improvement of products and the reduction of costs in order to resist economic aggression externally and help compatriots internally. We should strive to rise up."</p>
<h3>Talking About the Future of the Domestic Silk and Satin Industry at the Design Department of Daxin Silk and Satin Bureau</h3>
<p>Last Month's Sales Exceeded the Same Month Last Year by Eighty Percent</p>
<p>In order to implement his national salvation proposition, silk industry leader Mr. Wang Yansong reorganized the Daxin Silk and Satin Bureau originally located on Sanma Road and Shilu Road into the Daxin Domestic Silk and Satin Bureau starting from October 1st, sacrificing the sale of foreign goods and exclusively selling domestic silk and satin. He also established a design department within the bureau to plan and promote business operations. Since its opening, public groups such as the Shanghai Silk and Satin Association and the Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Association have all sent letters of praise, and enthusiastic women who love domestic silk and satin have eagerly purchased goods, leading to extremely prosperous business. According to the head of the bureau's design department, based on the observation of the bureau's sales records last month, the future of the domestic silk and satin industry is quite optimistic. The progress and regress of commercial warfare completely depends on the competition for purchasing power, which is also the competition for people's hearts. Therefore, today's operators of domestic products, if they can firmly hold a righteous proposition and compete with foreign goods for the purchasing power belonging to our people, there is no reason not to win. The decline of the domestic silk and satin industry in recent years is actually due to the failure to fully promote sales. It is not that Chinese people do not like to buy domestic silk and satin. After the bureau determined to sacrifice the sale of foreign goods and completely promote domestic silk and satin, the scope of goods and profits seemed to be narrower than before, but the resulting business results were actually larger than before. The total sales last month exceeded the same month last year by 80%. This is clear evidence that Chinese people love domestic silk and satin. If domestic silk and satin merchants can unite with each other and compete with foreign goods in an organized and planned manner, the future will be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Association Telegraphs Sichuan Authorities to Suppress Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Three Measures Proposed for Immediate Implementation</p>
<p>The Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Association, concerned that the recent rise in exchange rates has greatly affected Sichuan merchants in Shanghai, completely halting business, and that Sichuan students in Shanghai are also unable to remit expenses due to the high exchange rates, not only putting them at risk of dropping out of school but also causing them to struggle with their livelihoods, deemed the situation urgent and telegraphed the Sichuan authorities again to request that they find ways to suppress exchange rates. The original telegram is as follows: urgent, Chongqing, Director Liu Fucheng Jian, recently the Shanghai exchange rate has risen, even reaching a peak of 16-1700 per thousand, and the rising trend has not stopped. The impact has caused Sichuan merchants in Shanghai to halt business, and Sichuan students in Shanghai to suffer from food shortages and drop out of school. The financial situation in Sichuan is on the verge of crisis, causing anxiety. The current dangerous situation is no longer simply a matter of trade deficit. Investigation reveals that it is due to the erroneous financial policies in Sichuan, which are all about draining the pond to catch the fish and cutting flesh to heal sores, leading to a lack of resources among the people and an inability to bear the heavy burden. Recently, cash has been exhausted, paper money has inflated infinitely, the credibility of the authorities is not solid, and securities are being issued on top of each other. To fundamentally cure the disease, it is necessary to cultivate the people's resources and make a change in policy. However, the current situation is urgent and cannot be delayed. We must quickly seek relief. Suppressing exchange rates and stabilizing finance requires focused manpower and an understanding of the underlying causes, otherwise, it will not only be ineffective but also increase harm. Therefore, this association proposes several urgent measures: 1. Recall the current public receipts and restrict the use of drafts, so that the city's finances can become active and the discounting and secret deductions on exchange drafts can be gradually reduced, and the stability of exchange rates can be expected. 2. Restrict unnecessary foreign remittances to prevent the continuous outflow of funds from Sichuan, and prevent a few military personnel from privately transferring their property and harboring disloyal intentions. 3. Strictly crack down on speculative activities, such as the transactions in Chengdu, which are unnecessary commercial organizations. These exchanges, lacking physical guarantees, are exclusively manipulated by a few speculators and powerful figures, which harms the business of legitimate merchants. Although the above points are not fundamental solutions for stabilizing finance and suppressing exchange rates, they are also temporary urgent matters. We hope that they will be implemented immediately. This is crucial. Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Association respectfully kowtows, winter.</p>
<h3>Li Shijia Returned to Fujian Yesterday Morning</h3>

<h3>Wuyi Stranded at Dashigang</h3>
<p>China Merchants Bureau is Trying to Rescue</p>
<p>The Wuyi, a Nan Hua class ship of the China Merchants Bureau, is leased by the Jiping Shipping Company and operates on the Shanghai-Shantou-Guangdong route. This time, it left Shanghai for Guangdong with many goods, mainly consisting of piece goods, cotton yarn, and grain. After unloading goods in Shantou, it was heading to Guangdong. On the first of this month, the Wuyi encountered fog in the Dashihai waters near the port of Guangdong, causing the ship to run aground on a shoal. Because it was heavily loaded, it became deeply entrenched. The captain ran at full speed but was unable to escape danger, so he telegraphed the Guangdong branch for help. Upon receiving the report, the Guangdong branch telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters, saying that the Wuyi was stranded outside Dashigang, where the water was very shallow, and it was feared that it would be difficult to move away from the shoal. They were waiting for high tide tonight to see if it could escape danger. If it could not escape, they decided to hire a tugboat from Guangdong to rescue it at Dashigang and offload passengers and cargo. After receiving the report, the Shanghai Bureau has telegraphed the Guangdong branch to proceed with the rescue nearby to avoid prolonged delays and to report back at any time. It also informed the ship owner to investigate.</p>
<h3>Founding of the Danyang Shanghai Fellow Association</h3>

<h3>Patriotic Martyr Pan Hongsheng Dies of Illness Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Various Circles Organize Funeral Committee for the Martyr</p>
<p>Funeral Arrangements Determined, Requesting Financial Assistance from All Groups</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal All Circles Assistance Patriotic Martyr Committee convened an emergency meeting at 2 PM yesterday, attended by more than twenty people including Hu Hongxiang, Liu Zhongying, Wang Jingdong, Zhang Xianfang, Cao Zhigong, Zheng Dongshan, Chen Jiufeng, Yu Yaoqiu, and Shao Lǜbai. It was decided to organize a funeral committee for martyr Pan Hongsheng and to notify various groups. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Zhang Xianfang was elected chairman and after ceremonial formalities, the chairman first reported that patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng, indignant at the shamelessness of unscrupulous merchants who secretly transported enemy goods, fired shots as a warning, and was subsequently arrested by the police and convicted by the court. Because of his enthusiastic participation in the patriotic movement, he was imprisoned. However, Pan Hongsheng suffered from torture during detention, resulting in physical damage and a critical condition. The committee then bailed him out for medical treatment, but unfortunately, the illness was incurable and he passed away at 5 AM yesterday (the 3rd) at his residence in Rìshēng Lane, Fāngxié Road. Upon hearing the news, we are deeply saddened and have convened this emergency meeting to jointly discuss the martyr's funeral and related matters.</p>
<p>Election of Staff</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, discussions began and resolutions were passed as follows: (1) Regarding how to commemorate patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng, it was resolved: (1) To establish a funeral committee for martyr Pan, with Zhang Xianfang, Liu Zhongying, Ye Jiaxing, Yu Yaoqiu, Chen Binghui, Zhu Zhichun, Qu Zhenhua, Cao Zhigong, Chen Jiufeng, Ren Nongxuan, Ge Futian, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, Li Weiliang, Tao Leqin, Zheng Dongshan, Ma Junshuo, Liang Nianzhou, etc., as members.

<p>Funeral Arrangements</p>
<p>The committee also established the following arrangements for the martyr's memorial service: (1) Notify all groups to attend the funeral procession to express condolences. (2) Request the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward letters to various trade guilds, the Citizens' United Association to forward letters to various district branches, the General Labour Union to forward letters to various labour unions, and various groups to inform their members to fly flags at half-mast on the day of the funeral. (3) Urge all committee members to collect donations and send letters to various groups requesting financial assistance for the funeral, with a minimum donation of ten yuan or more, to be sent to the committee immediately for funeral expenses. (4) Appoint Zhang Zifang, Liu Zhongying, Yu Yaoqiu, Chen Jiufeng, Ren Nongxuan, and Chen Binghui as representatives of the committee to express condolences and assist the family of martyr Pan with all funeral arrangements.

(7) The second funeral committee meeting is scheduled for 1 PM tomorrow. (8) Issue a declaration of mourning for martyr Pan.</p>
<p>Letter to Various Groups</p>
<p>The committee sent letters to various groups yesterday, soliciting funeral expenses and requesting flags at half-mast on the day of the funeral. The letter stated: "Patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng was loyal to saving the nation and enthusiastic about the movement, warning unscrupulous merchants and unfortunately being arrested and imprisoned. He was subjected to coercion, intimidation, and electric torture, forcing him to confess, resulting in serious injuries and unbearable pain, leading to chronic illness and critical condition. He was compelled to request bail from the court for medical treatment, but unfortunately, his condition was severe and medical treatment was ineffective. He passed away at 5 AM on the 3rd of this month. We, as colleagues, believe that the spirit of the patriotic martyr who sacrificed himself for the country will live on. It has been resolved: (1) Please donate funeral expenses of ten yuan or more to support the arrangements. (2) Fly flags at half-mast on the day of the funeral, etc., as resolved. Accordingly, we are sending this letter, hoping that you will investigate and reply immediately to comfort the martyr and inspire future generations. Your support would be deeply appreciated and we are sincerely grateful."</p>
<p>Urge for Donation Collection</p>
<p>The committee also sent letters to various donation collectors yesterday, urging them to collect donations. The letter stated: "Patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng passed away at 5 AM today at his home at No. 30 Rìshēng Lane, Fāngxié Road. The donation booklet was sent to you previously and has been received. The funeral arrangements for Pan Hongsheng have already begun, and the required funds are urgently needed. We kindly request that you send the collected donations, regardless of the amount, to the committee as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs. Shanghai All Circles Assistance Patriotic Martyr Committee, November 3rd."</p>
<h3>Patriotic Martyr Assistance Association Appeals to Ma Xiangbo</h3>
<p>Requesting the National Government to Grant Amnesty to</p>
<p>Patriotic Martyrs Liu Chongwu, etc.</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Assistance Patriotic Martyr Committee has sent a letter to nonagenarian Ma Xiangbo, requesting him to advise the National Government to grant amnesty to patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, etc., to meet the public's expectations. The original text is recorded below: "Respectfully to Mr. Xiangbo: In light of the urgent national humiliation and the failure to recover lost territory, shameless merchants still dare to collude with the enemy and sell enemy goods, even blatantly changing their appearance and using the enemy's weapons to kill our compatriots. How can we bear this? Fortunately, there are patriotic martyrs such as Liu Chongwu, who, indignant at the treachery of the merchants, used bullets as a warning, hoping to awaken them. Unfortunately, they were caught in the legal net and imprisoned. We believe that people should sympathize with each other, and we should have compassion. Looking at the Northeast Volunteer Army, who can bravely fight on the battlefield and desperately fight the enemy, it is because they cannot bear to see their compatriots being trampled upon. Now, the treacherous merchants are helping the enemy and providing them with resources, which is the root of the disaster. Therefore, patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu and others are able to abandon personal gain and work hard to eliminate national traitors, which is a special action in a time of national crisis. It is not appropriate to treat them as ordinary criminals and impose imprisonment. We admire your high moral character, far-sightedness, and broad knowledge, and you are respected by the people of the country. We humbly request you to advise the National Government to grant them amnesty, both to comfort the families of the martyrs and to meet the public's expectations. We believe that you have always held a passion for justice and courage, and we hope that you will vigorously promote this matter."</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Wang Qi Discusses Art as a Means of Saving the Nation</h3>
<p>The Decline of Morality is a Result of Excessive Material Desires</p>
<p>Promoting Spiritual Life is the Secret to Saving China</p>
<p>——Book and Painting Exhibition Ends Today——</p>
<p>Central Committee member Wang Qi has a refined and elegant personality and a fondness for painting. Despite his busy official duties, he always finds time to practice, resulting in many masterpieces that evoke admiration. To promote art, he came to Shanghai specifically to hold a book and painting exhibition at the Húshè Art Society. In recent days, the exhibition has been extremely popular, and many works have been purchased. A reporter from Shēnshí Daily visited Mr. Wang at the Húshè Art Society yesterday and was received. Mr. Wang shared his thoughts on art as follows:</p>
<p>Ancient Paintings and Modern Paintings</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wang, Chinese paintings developed very early, reaching a high level of development by the Sòng and Yuán dynasties, and even more so in the Míng and Qīng dynasties. Therefore, paintings are still progressing today. However, ancient paintings have a mature and experienced style, while modern paintings are innovative and explore new paths, with many different types. However, they are far less mature and experienced than ancient paintings.</p>
<p>Calligraphy Has Declined</p>
<p>While paintings are progressing every day without ceasing, calligraphy is different. Chinese characters are a form of art, which is a major difference from foreign characters. However, the progress of writing has a certain limit and cannot exceed a certain standard. Therefore, Chinese calligraphy has now declined.</p>
<p>Art Can Save the Nation</p>
<p>Mr. Wang continued, "The cause of the current world decline is that humanity's material desires are too high and they do not pay attention to spiritual life. As a result of indulging in desires, individuals are ruined and nations are in chaos. The reason why China is so weak now is that its citizens have not paid attention to spiritual life. I have seen this, so when I was in Beijing before, I organized a personal book and painting exhibition to promote art, because there were very few people in Beijing who held such exhibitions. After this, many people followed my example and held exhibitions, so the development of the art movement in Beijing is now faster than before. This time, I came to Shanghai to hold an exhibition with the same intention. I believe that if the people of the country can jointly pay attention to art and vigorously promote it, then the people's material desires can gradually be reduced, and the country can be saved." The reporter finally asked when he would return to Beijing. He replied that after the exhibition ends today, he will rest for a while and take the night train back to Beijing tomorrow evening.</p>
<h3>Construction Begins on the Ministry of Industry's Major Fishing Market</h3>
<p>Site Designated at Zhōujiāzuǐ, Yángshùpǔ</p>
<p>According to Shēnshí Daily, the Ministry of Industry, in view of the recent decline of China's fishing industry, is preparing to build a major fishing market in Shanghai, with a total budget of 500,000 yuan. The construction of the market has been awarded to the Xīnchāngtài Construction Company, and the contract has been signed. Construction will begin in the coming days. A reporter from Shēnshí Daily investigated the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Location Determined</p>
<p>The major fishing market planned by the Ministry of Industry in Shanghai covers an area of more than 40 mu (approximately 6.7 acres), located at Zhōujiāzuǐ Island, Yángshùpǔ. It was designed by architect Xu Jingzhi of the Xìngyè Architectural Firm and is fully equipped and large-scale, including a fishing market, warehouses, cold storage, and offices. It is also equipped with wireless radio equipment to report on fishing conditions and market prices. In addition, several transport steamships have been purchased to transport fresh fish.</p>
<p>Construction Project</p>
<p>The total budget for the fishing market is 500,000 yuan, which has been approved by the Central Political Council. The construction cost is 300,000 yuan, and other equipment and cold storage costs are approximately 200,000 yuan. The construction has been awarded to the Xīnchāngtài Construction Company in the city, and the contract has been signed. Construction will begin in the coming days. The refrigeration machinery will be installed by the United Engineering Company, and the floating wharf will be built by the Jiāngnán Shipyard. The entire project is expected to be completed in time for the spring fishing season next year.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Fires Box Cannon, Wounding Owner of Tobacco and Paper Shop</h3>
<p>Excessive Blood Loss Endangers Life</p>
<p>Offending Police Officer Has Been Detained</p>
<p>Yáng Xīhuì, a patrol leader of the Xīn Xī District Police Station on Municipal Government Road, under the jurisdiction of the Xīmén Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, instructed patrol leader Wáng Xīndōng and armed police officers such as Niè Yíchén from the Zhàofēng Road Police Station to patrol the Nányáng Middle School and Dàmùqiáo area under their jurisdiction on the night before last at around 9 PM. While the police officers were patrolling near Lónghuá Road, they suddenly saw a man in the dark hurrying into a tobacco and paper shop at No. 1386. The police officers were suspicious, fearing that he was a bandit, and followed him into the shop. They saw four people playing mahjong around a table, all of whom were startled by the arrival of the police officers. At the same time, the man who had hurried in ran towards the back door of the shop. Seeing this, police officer Niè quickly raised his box cannon and aimed it at the man, shouting for him to stop. Unexpectedly, in his haste, he accidentally triggered the gun, and with a "bang," the bullet was fired, hitting the man directly. The man immediately fell to the ground, shouting for help. When neighbors heard the noise and rushed to the scene, they realized that the man was the local owner of the tobacco and paper shop, Xí Ānǚ. Upon realizing what had happened, the police officers quickly carried him out and stopped a truck from the Běipiào Coal Mining Company that was passing by on Nányóu Road. The man was severely injured and lost a lot of blood, putting his life in danger. The offending police officer Niè Yíchén was detained, and a report was immediately submitted to the General Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Guild Holds General Meeting Yesterday, Opposing New Rickshaw Designs, etc.</h3>
<p>Resolution Unanimously Supports the August 6th Proposal</p>
<p>Based on the Proposal, the Guild Expresses Firm Rejection</p>
<p>According to Xīnshēng News, the rickshaw merchants in the special zone held a general meeting of members at their meeting hall on Láihè Road at 9 AM yesterday to oppose the full registration of rickshaw pullers and the new rickshaw designs, as well as the impoundment of vehicles. More than two hundred people attended, including Yīn Zhīlíng, Gù Sōngmào, and Hóu Shàoān. The meeting was chaired by Jīn Bǎilín, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Unanimously support the proposal of the equal meeting convened on August 6th by the General Manager of the Public Works Department, Mr. Zhōng Sī, and the Assistant Manager, Mr. Hè Dékuí, as well as the Chinese Director, Mr. Yú Qiàqīng. This proposal is recorded in Article 8 of the Public Works Department's gazette on August 15th, which states that rickshaw designs cannot be changed mid-way unless the rickshaw owners and pullers agree that a change is necessary. The Rickshaw Committee does not respect this proposal, arbitrarily acting against the trend and deliberately creating difficulties. The guild unanimously rejects this, withdraws its representatives, and suspends payment of mutual aid fees to show its determination. (2) The Rickshaw Committee's registration of rickshaw pullers on the 19th of this month is considered impractical by the guild. There are more than 100,000 rickshaw pullers in Shanghai. If each rickshaw has three pullers, there will only be 30,000 people. It is not known where to start, and this may cause unexpected turmoil in the city. The Rickshaw Committee should bear full responsibility. The guild believes that it is necessary to petition for the revocation of the order. (3) Regarding the case of the Public Works Department punishing rickshaw owners for overcharging fares, the guild fundamentally believes that it is inappropriate. It should be known that whether or not there is overcharging cannot be based on empty words. At the very least, there must be witnesses and evidence to prove it. Even if there is such a fact, it is the responsibility of the person renting out the rickshaw, and the rickshaw owner should not be arbitrarily punished. The authorities should be requested to stop this practice. (4) Regarding the case of impounding vehicles, the guild believes that vehicles should not be arbitrarily impounded before there are specific regulations. Vehicles should only be temporarily impounded if there is obvious damage or error. Otherwise, it is fault-finding, which is extremely harmful. (5) A petition will be submitted to the Public Works Department on Monday, demanding the revocation of the order and the improvement of treatment. The guild will not stop until its goals are achieved.</p>
<h3>Female Dancer Doused with Corrosive Liquid, University Student Imprisoned</h3>
<p>Willing to Serve a Three-Year Sentence</p>
<p>Judge Advises Before Imprisonment</p>
<p>Huáng Nǎiwǔ, a university student from Jiāngxī Province, harbored resentment after a love affair with Lǐ Xiùyīng, a dancer at the Dà Hù Dance Hall, ended. On the evening of June 20th of this year, he instigated Jiǎng Ādà, a rascal from Sūzhōu, to take corrosive liquid to the Dà Hù Dance Hall and douse Lǐ with it, in order to disfigure her and vent his anger. Unexpectedly, in his haste and panic, Jiǎng mistakenly doused Qiū Lìfēi, another dancer, with the corrosive liquid, causing injuries to Qiū's face, chest, and back. After hearing the news, the French police immediately ordered detectives to rush to the scene and arrest Huáng and Jiǎng, transferring them to the Second Special Court for investigation. The victim, Qiū Lìfēi, also filed an ancillary private lawsuit, seeking damages of 48,000 yuan. As a result, Huáng and Jiǎng, the two defendants, were sentenced to ten months of imprisonment each for injuring another person's body. The ancillary civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court for trial. Huáng, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. As a result, the sentence was changed to three years of imprisonment. Huáng was even more dissatisfied and filed a third appeal with the Supreme Court. The ancillary civil lawsuit was also mediated by the civil court, with Huáng compensating Qiū 3,000 yuan each. These events have been reported previously. It is now known that Huáng Nǎiwǔ, who was detained in the Second Special Court's detention center, submitted a petition to the Third Branch of the High Court, requesting the withdrawal of his appeal because the third appeal would take a long time. He expressed his willingness to be sent to prison. The High Court accepted the petition and ordered that Huáng Nǎiwǔ be brought to court yesterday morning by Judge Zhāng Cháozuǒ. After a brief interrogation, he was informed that the three-year sentence, after deductions, would not be long. He was told to abide by the law and cultivate himself well in prison, and time would pass quickly. When he is released after serving his sentence, he can still be a good person and serve society and the country. Huáng listened and agreed. After the hearing, the court ordered the bailiffs to take Huáng to the Second Special Prison to serve his sentence. The corrosive liquid dousing and injury case has now come to an end.</p>
<h3>Burglary Occurs on Avenue Foch</h3>
<p>Losses Amount to Approximately Six to Seven Thousand Gold</p>
<p>Owner's Handgun Also Stolen</p>
<p>At around 12:30 PM, three bandits suddenly appeared at the home of a certain Mr. X at No. 18, Lane 508 on Avenue Foch, between Avenue Mūllànd and Route du Consulat, under the jurisdiction of the Route du Consulat police station on Chengdu Road. Only two of the bandits carried handguns. One bandit stood guard outside, while the other two entered the house, shouting to stop the servants and ordering them to lead them upstairs. The family members upstairs were also restrained. The bandits then began to ransack the house, searching everywhere. Unable to find what they were looking for, they ordered the owner to hand over the silver box and the keys to the drawers.

<h3>Japan Monopolizes Petroleum in Manchukuo; Shanghai Oil Merchants Issue Statement</h3>
<p>Foreign Oil Companies Have More Than 30 Years of History in Manchuria</p>
<p>Implementation of the Monopoly Will Inevitably Lead to Closure of Plants and Withdrawal from Manchuria</p>
<p>According to the Continental Press, a senior official of a major petroleum company told a reporter from the Continental Press yesterday that, in the opinion of representatives of major oil companies in Shanghai, although the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands have protested Japan's plan to implement a petroleum monopoly in "Manchukuo," the Japanese government will not hesitate to implement its decision. This move will wipe out all foreign oil companies that have been operating in Manchuria for nearly 30 years. Currently, there are four major oil companies in Manchuria, namely American Mobil, Texaco, British Asiatic, and the Soviet Russian Petroleum Monopoly. The fate of the Manchukuo puppet state is completely in the hands of the Japanese. Now, under the guidance of the Japanese government, a petroleum monopoly will be announced, completely controlling the petroleum industry in Manchuria. This is the first clear step taken by Japan in establishing a monopoly and suppressing foreign businesses in Manchuria. Although Japan previously promised to maintain the open door policy in Manchuria, its effectiveness is now equal to zero. According to news reports, the puppet government will handle the Fǔshān Oil Refinery and the Dàyùn Oil Refinery, which is about to be completed. The oil needed beyond the output of these two plants will be supplied through bidding by companies that previously operated in the oil industry in Manchuria. The supplied oil will be marked with the government's monopoly logo, and the companies' previous trademarks will be abolished. It is also planned to divide Manchuria into ten regions, each with a monopoly manager, who will naturally be Japanese. The manager will manage the business within the region. At least 80 percent of the capital of the monopoly company will be provided by the Japanese. Except for the Soviet Russian oil company, which only started trading in the East in the past five years, the other foreign oil companies have been established in Manchuria for more than 30 years, with huge investments in factories and equipment. If the monopoly is implemented, it will inevitably lead to the closure of plants and withdrawal from Manchuria, and the losses will be unimaginable. According to an official who expressed his opinion yesterday, the Japanese government will make a concrete decision on the American protest within a few days, so the matter will be resolved soon. The official did not want to express his opinion on whether this protest would be effective, nor did he want to comment on the protests raised by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.</p>

<h3>Trial of the Violent Incident at the Paradise Theater</h3>
<p>Principal Culprit Still at Large, Cause of Incident Revealed</p>
<p>Offenders Who Caused Damage Sentenced to 20 Days of Detention</p>
<p>The Lèyuán Teahouse at No. 556, Jiǔjiāng Road, Húběi Road, recently opened the Dà Guǎnghán Opera House in partnership with Shěn Jítáng and others, featuring performances of the "Assembly of Talents," with shows starting at 8 PM every night and tickets costing 20 cents. The troupe came from the Chūn Gé Teahouse on Zhèjiāng Road. The business had been doing well since its opening less than 10 days ago. However, a group of unemployed hooligans, who refused to buy tickets and instead watched the free shows from outside, were denied entry by the ticket collector, leading to a grudge. Among them, the hooligans Zhāng Zhōubǎo and a man nicknamed "Lín Yǎn Mápí" were the most resentful and repeatedly thought of revenge. Zhāng went to visit Liú Xǐzhèng, a worker at the Huángshēngjì Mirror and Wood Factory on Zhōnghuá Road, Zháběi, and asked for help. Liú agreed to the request. Liú then invited more than 20 workers from the factory, most of whom were wearing blue cloth shirts and shorts, to gather at a small teahouse on the Avenue des Soeurs in the Concession in the evening. The group was indignant and unanimously agreed to help, resolving to destroy the opera house. If anyone interfered, they would attack together. At the same time, Zhāng first went to the opera house and bought several tickets, distributing one to each person. At the same time, Lín Yǎn Mápí also had the same evil idea, entrusting Liú Ādà to gather six beggars. Each of them held a ticket. At around 7 PM, those invited by Zhāng and Lín entered one after another, pretending to be customers and taking their seats to listen to the performance. At around 9 PM, when the audience was gathered, Liú and Liú shouted a command, and the crowd rose up and began their work. Teapots and chairs flew everywhere, and tables and teacups were smashed. The sound of smashing was incessant, and the order in the theater was immediately disrupted. Chén Āwǔ, a waiter, was also beaten and injured. The staff of the theater then closed the iron gates outside and telegraphed the Lǎozhá Police Station, which immediately dispatched a large number of detectives, including Wáng Yīfēi, Xiè Guìshēng, and Lǐ Shùguàn, in a large car. They saw the hooligans still carrying out the destruction. Upon seeing the detectives, they tried to escape, but were blocked by the iron gates. None of the criminals escaped. Liú Xǐzhèng, Liú Ādà, Chén Bógen, Dīng Lùbǎo, Zhōu Ruìkāng, Pān Zhènjīn, Lè Hé荣, Cáo Guìgēn, Yú Sìdào, Wáng Huìtóng, Zhāng Ziliáng, Yáng Ābǎo, Qián Zijjiāng, Wáng Sānbǎo, Wáng Ziyào, Yú Āsān, Dīng Ruìshēng, Wáng Gānshēng, Chén Jīnrú, Zhāng Bǐngróng, Pān Jīnbǎo, Sòng Róngbèi, Chén Ruìtíng, Chén Xīchū, Wáng Āgēn, Gāo Jīnshēng, Chén Fú, Chén Āmáo, Liú Ādà, Wáng Démíng, and Wáng Dūróng were arrested on the spot. The principal culprits, Zhāng and Lín, were not present at the time and escaped. All of them were taken to the police station and detained. Afterwards, the theater checked the damaged items, which included 20 tables, 26 chairs, 186 teapots, and 310 teacups, with a value of 200 yuan. A list of the losses was submitted to the police station. Yesterday morning, the 31 arrested were taken to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Qián Xúnjiǔ, filed charges of property damage under Article 382 of the Criminal Law. He explained the case, stating that the principal culprits were still at large and the cause of the incident was not clear. Therefore, he requested that the trial of Liú Xǐzhèng and Liú Ādà be postponed. He requested that the remaining individuals be punished according to the law. The judge, Dou Baosun, interrogated each of the accused. Except for Wáng Huìtóng, who claimed that he was not involved and had suffered a serious head injury, the others all admitted to participating in the incident. Judge Dou Baosun reviewed the confessions and ruled that Liú Xǐzhèng and Liú Ādà be remanded in custody. Wáng Huìtóng was acquitted. The remaining 28 people, including Chén Bógen, were sentenced to 20 days of detention each for jointly damaging other people's property as a warning.</p>

<h3>Fire at Qin Feng Textile Factory Yesterday</h3>
<p>Losses Exceed 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>More Than One Fire Has Occurred</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, a fire broke out at the Qin Feng Textile Factory at No. 162 Route du Père Huc in the French Concession at 2:00 p.m. yesterday when a motor exploded and ignited cotton. The fire spread to more than ten rooms of the factory's machine room and cotton yarn room along the western part of Anshun Lane south of Kangding Road, which were completely engulfed in flames in an instant. Although the factory workers tried hard to put out the fire, it had already spread widely. Neighbors reported the fire to the fire department by telephone. Firefighters from Songshan Road and Lujiawan, as well as police officers, rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. The factory usually had cotton fluff flying around, which was quite annoying to the neighbors, so a layer of fence was added to the short wall on the south end of Anshun Lane on Kangding Road to prevent the cotton fluff. When the fire was raging, the fence on the wall caught fire, which burned the gate of No. 79 Anshun Lane and the sign hanging outside Dr. Yang's gate at No. 80. Fortunately, the fire truck had arrived at that time, so they were not affected. No. 67 of that lane, which was right downwind of the fire, was particularly frightened. It was not until after 4:00 p.m. that the fire was completely extinguished, and the firefighters did not stop watering until about 6:00 p.m. The forward buildings along Route du Père Huc, such as the office, foreman's office, and wholesale buildings, were not affected due to the wind direction. However, the back machine room, cotton yarn room, storage room, etc., about ten rooms in total, were completely destroyed. The total loss is estimated to be more than 30,000 yuan. The factory has insured its houses, machines, and goods with the Taiping Insurance Company.</p>
<p>According to nearby residents, the cotton fluff from the factory usually flies around with the wind, which is quite harmful to the health of the residents, and cotton fires have occurred more than once, but they have been extinguished by themselves. However, the neighbors are often frightened by this.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Railway Freight Charges for Postal Postcards</h3>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>According to a statement by the involved party, Wang Yigong, our client is a businessman traveling to Shanghai with friends to establish the New China Advertising Company, conducting legitimate business without any improper conduct. Recently, we read an article in the Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Min Bao, Da Ribao, Da Mei Wan Bao, and Haowai Shibao, dated October 31st of this year, titled "Young Woman Accuses Tian Yun Lou Inspector of Abandonment," which stated: "Changre, a young woman also known as Yu Lan and Xiuzhen, was introduced by Qiu to Tian Yun Lou after her former husband, Sang Zhengbang, was arrested for opium use. She asked Inspector Zhong Dexin for help, and during this time, she met Wang Yigong. Zhong Dexin arranged for them to live together, but she was soon abandoned." This account is completely inaccurate. We have already commissioned your esteemed lawyers to publish a rebuttal in various newspapers. Luo Yulan is essentially a prostitute who worked as a tea server at Tian Yun Lou. If she were truly from a wealthy family, why would she be doing such menial work? As for Wang providing her with accommodation, it was merely out of compassion for her lack of means. Luo is naturally promiscuous and left of her own accord. There is no question of disrupting public morals or abandonment. Furthermore, our client is neither employed by the Nanyang Tobacco Company nor an inspector at Tian Yun Lou. Now, various newspapers have publicly slandered him with false reports, possibly with ulterior motives. This concerns his reputation, and we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specifically request that you send a letter to various newspapers for correction. Based on this, we hereby send this letter and hope you will publish the correction promptly.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lawyer Shi Zao Ren, November</p>

<h3>Scotta Cup Tie Between Youyou and Jewish First Division. Donghua Defeats Larks</h3>
<p>Youyou and Jewish Tie at Five to Five</p>
<p>Donghua Shows its Edge with a Five to One Victory Over Larks</p>
<p>The first match of the Western Football Association's Scotta Cup, Youyou versus Jewish, opened yesterday in Shanghai. Jewish had previously lost to Youyou 2-7 in the league. Yesterday, they met again with extra animosity. Coupled with a disadvantage in coordination, they could not summon the necessary spirit to resist. Although Youyou had been trying to improve since repeated defeats, they ultimately suffered from a lack of coordination, failing to achieve their desired performance. Jewish was able to lead 5-3. Youyou, relying on their final efforts, tied the game at 5-5. The First Division makeup game between Donghua and Larks was held at Yiyuan. After Wan Xianghua's return to his old team, Donghua's morale was greatly boosted. Throughout the entire match, the situation was controlled by Donghua's players, resulting in a decisive 5-1 victory. However, it is regrettable that Li Yi did not change his ways and was ejected from the field midway through the game.</p>
<p>Donghua Beats Larks</p>
<p>Five to One, Enemy Loses Spirit</p>
<p>Li Yichen Ejected</p>
<p>The First Division match between Donghua and Larks was held at Yiyuan, attracting a large crowd of spectators. In the first half, Wan Xianghua and Li Yichen each scored a goal for Donghua. At the beginning of the second half, Donghua suffered great hardship, conceding a goal first. Li Yichen aggressively attacked and ultimately defeated the enemy 5-1.</p>
<p>Two Goals in a Row</p>
<p>Donghua kicked off and attacked first with great momentum, making short passes towards the enemy camp. Larks were not to be trifled with and defended resolutely. The situation was tense, and neither side gained an advantage after twenty minutes of stalemate. Suddenly, Donghua's valiant generals Wan Xianghua and Li Yichen charged forward together with great power. Enemy generals tried to intercept, but Yichen was blocked and unable to advance deeply. He passed to Wan, who swiftly advanced, approached the goal, and lightly hit the goalpost, deflecting the ball into the net, scoring the first goal. The team's morale soared, and everyone fought bravely. Yichen and Lin Jing attempted to score, but all attempts were saved. At thirty minutes, Yichen received a corner kick from Xianghua, rose up and headed it in with exquisite skill, scoring again.</p>
<p>Lucky Star Shines</p>
<p>Larks, trailing by two goals, did not lose heart. Intending to retaliate, they fought even harder. Pao Shalie's shot hit the post, missing by only an inch. Burke attacked from an oblique angle, disrupting the fortress. Mike Lau made a sudden shot on flat ground, and Lu Chuanen fell on his back but managed to save it. It was truly like a hail of bullets, with enemies on all sides. Fortunately, they managed to escape danger. Not only did Donghua suffer greatly, but the audience's hearts were pounding like deer, filled with anxiety.</p>
<p>Fortune is Unpredictable</p>
<p>After the first half, Donghua's precarious situation continued. In less than ten minutes, Larks advanced with five players, surrounding the city. Burke seized the opportunity to shoot, but Lu Zhongen blocked it, only for the young Bao Shalie to catch up and add another kick, hitting Zhongen's back and bouncing into the goal. Soon after, Li Yichen injured the opposing goalkeeper's ankle and was ejected from the field. From then on, Donghua fought with only ten players. Fortunately, their formation was orderly, and they continued to attack fiercely. Wan Xianghua used a high ball to trouble the enemy, sending it towards the goal. Chen Hongguang jumped forward, intercepted it, and passed it to Xing Jiaqiu, who scored with one kick, gaining another goal. Donghua thus won 3-1. Fortune and misfortune are indeed unpredictable.</p>
<p>Two More Goals</p>
<p>At this point in the game, the outcome seemed predetermined. Although Larks were ambitious and determined to recover, they were trapped by Donghua's defense and could do nothing. Donghua's momentum remained strong, and they continued to attack fiercely. At twenty-five minutes, Hongguang and Lin Jing cooperated to pass the ball in, and Wan Xianghua scored again. In the last ten minutes, Jia Youliang, who had been quiet, suddenly became active, launching an attack from the border. Jiaqiu responded well and kicked the ball, hitting the enemy general Stanger's back and bouncing off the goalpost. As it was about to enter, the goalkeeper dove to push it out, but the referee had already declared a goal, resulting in a final score of 5-1.</p>
<p>Donghua Team: Wan Xianghua, Li Ning, Ban Shangdong, Li Yichen, Si, Feng Yunyou, Dai Linjing, Guan Huanan, Chen Hongguang, Chen Jiaqiu, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Larks: W. Ke Que Tou, Niu Bo Jia, Kliff, Simon, Shi Yuange, La Li Ong, B. Aqitai, Bao Shali, Mike La, Ke Quelun, Burke</p>
<p>Youyou Struggles Against Jewish</p>
<p>Dragging Feet Leads to Average Performance</p>
<p>Penalty Kicks Result in a Five to Five Tie</p>
<p>Youyou's morale has been scattered for the past two weeks, and the team lacks fighting spirit. Yesterday, they met Jewish in the first round of the Shi Gaota Cup. Their offense and defense were unnatural. In the first half, they only managed to tie 2-2. In the second half, they were repeatedly pressured by Jewish and fell behind with a dangerous score of 5-3. Fortunately, Luo and Sun worked hard to avoid defeat. It was indeed a close call. Overall, both sides performed averagely, especially in the second half. The result was a 5-5 tie, requiring a rematch.</p>
<p>Tit-for-Tat Start</p>
<p>Youyou kicked off, but their attack was unsuccessful. Their defense showed weaknesses, and Jewish's five forwards used their agile skills to launch a fierce attack on Youyou's defensive zone, creating dangerous situations. Jiang and Wang, the two defenders, were busy blocking and intercepting, tiring themselves out. After a long time, Jewish's right winger Pang Chui penetrated to the end line and crossed the ball. Greenburg seized the opportunity and scored the first goal with a header. Youyou's anger was aroused, and Mei Hongbin attacked straight in, passing to Lao Sun, who unleashed a powerful shot and scored as well.</p>
<p>Fierce Attacks, Difficult to Determine Winner</p>
<p>Zhen Xiang's footwork was unsteady, and his kicks were either too high or too far, causing difficulties for the receivers. As a result, opportunities were missed repeatedly. Luo Haiguang and Lao Yi failed to cooperate effectively, and there were very few chances to score. Bolinggai moved like a rabbit, and the small-mustached Yun Feng failed to block him effectively. S. Greenburg desperately cleared the ball, and Xu Xiang jumped to catch it, but he jumped too early, and the ball flew off his back into the net, making it 2-1. Zhong Yongsen was filled with anger and charged in alone. Luo Haiguang intercepted halfway, scoring an easy goal and tying the game again.</p>
<p>Unpredictable Gains and Losses</p>
<p>Before the break was over, the warhorses roared again. Youyou were determined to attack fiercely, and Jewish were also fighting bravely. They failed to score three or four times. An ambush from the enemy's left wing caught them off guard. Wang Shusen failed to block effectively, and center forward Bolinggai kicked in time, achieving another goal. At this time, Youyou's counterattack became even more urgent. Both sides were eager to win, and their actions became rough. After Zhong Yongsen broke into the midline, he performed a header. G. Greenburg regretted not using his foot instead of his hand, and a penalty kick was awarded. Sun Tuitui's kick was too accurate and was saved by the goalkeeper into a corner kick. The spectators were very disappointed. Fortunately, Zhong soon made a low shot that bounced off the right goalpost into the net, tying the game for the third time.</p>
<p>Surprising, Joyful, and Indistinguishable</p>
<p>In less than five minutes, Sun Tuitui made a long pass to Mei Honggui, who entered the center again. Luo Haiguang picked up the ball in the chaos and shot fiercely. It was so fast that Dick Fei's stomach bounced it out. Although this ball did not enter the goal, the enemy was already greatly frightened. Paichek seized the opportunity to fish in troubled waters and scored with a long shot. Bolinggai followed up with a high shot, reaching a score of 5-3. Everyone thought Youyou would have no way to counterattack and would definitely lose. Who knew that the situation would change suddenly? Xiao Luo tried his skills at the goal, and G. Greenburg was truly a troublemaker, accidentally kicking the ball into his own goal. At this time, the situation was even more unfavorable. He was penalized again for illegally tripping a player, and another penalty kick was awarded. Sun Tuitui took the penalty and sent the ball into the enemy's goal, making it a 5-5 tie. The referee announced the end of the time, and a rematch was still required.</p>
<p>Youyou: Liang Shutang, Wang Nanzhen, Wang Shusen, Sun Jinshun, Xu Heng, Chen Zhenxiang, Luo Haiguang, Jiang Shanjing, Zhong Yongsen, Yun Feng, Mei Hongbao</p>
<p>Jewish: Gaotefei, G. Greenburg, Dickfei, Hasting, M. Ge Bei Bo, Haixueguang, L. Greenburg, S. Greenburg, Bolinggai, Paikeche, Tuotuoman</p>

<h3>Sixth Route Army Prepares to Hold Sports Meet</h3>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) Xue Yue, Commander-in-Chief of the Sixth Route Army for Suppressing Bandits, previously proposed to hold the First Sports Meet of the Sixth Route Army to promote military sports. Six units, including the General Headquarters, the Fourth Army Headquarters (the two are combined into one unit), the Tax Police Regiment, the 59th Division, the 90th Division, the 92nd Division, and the 93rd Division, jointly prepared for the event. The sports ground was set up in Hexi and built by the Tax Police Regiment. The Regiment Commander Wen Yingxing personally led soldiers to work on the construction every day. The entire construction was completed last month (September) and named Zhongshan Stadium. Its main avenue is connected to Zhongzheng Road. To the left of the avenue is the parking lot, and to the right is the Ji Song Park. The flowers and trees in the park are well-arranged, and the small paths are winding. The Zhongzheng Pavilion stands tall in the north of the park, overlooking the stream, with a magnificent appearance. To the west is the sports ground. From east to west, there are sequentially a tennis court, a track and field area, a football field, a basketball court, and a volleyball court, all suitably equipped. The entire field is surrounded by pine and cypress trees, simple and solid. In the center of the south side of the field is the command platform, called Boling Platform (Commander Xue's courtesy name is Boling). In the center of the north side of the field is the music pavilion called Yongzhi Music Pavilion (Minister Kong's courtesy name is Yongzhi). To the left of the platform is the office of the organizing committee, and to the right is an open space, simple but elegant, plain but not crude. This is the result of the efforts of thousands of people over dozens of days. Every time the red sun rises and sets, athletes run and chase in the field, soldiers with guns practice outside the field, merchants travel on the roads, and farmers are everywhere in the fields. The entire town's military and civilians are marching on the road of new and self-strengthening, truly a new atmosphere for national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>The construction of all sports fields and swimming pools for the First Sports Meet of the Sixth Route Army has been completed by the Tax Police Regiment stationed in Shaxi. However, the organizing committee recently decided to postpone the event due to the rapid progress in the bandit suppression military operations. Sweeping away the bandits' lairs is imminent. By order of Chairman Jiang, the date has been changed to coincide with the victory celebration after the bandit suppression military operations are concluded. Therefore, the originally scheduled opening date of October 2nd has now been postponed. However, all preparatory work is still continuing. In addition, the units of the Route Army recently held a friendly basketball game at the Shaxi Sports Ground. Except for the 92nd Division basketball team, the teams from the General Headquarters, the 59th Division, the 90th Division, and the 93rd Division all came to Shaxi to compete against the Tax Police Regiment basketball team. The Tax Police always won, demonstrating their strength, which was far superior to that of the other teams. It is expected that the Tax Police Regiment team will have a good chance of winning the basketball championship in the upcoming competition.</p>

<h3>Key Points for Recent Improvements in Colleges and Universities by the Ministry of Education (4)</h3>
<p>(5) Emphasize Practical Subjects and Limit the Establishment and Enrollment of Arts and Law Subjects According to the statistics of the 20th year, there are a total of 103 colleges and universities in the country, with a total of 187 colleges, 676 departments, 73 subjects, and 132 groups. In terms of colleges, arts (science, law, commerce, education) account for 59%, and practical subjects (science, agriculture, engineering, medicine) account for 41%. In terms of departments, arts account for 58%, and practical subjects account for 42%. In terms of students, there were a total of 44,167 students in the 20th year, with arts students accounting for 74.5% and practical subject students accounting for 25.5%, a difference of 49%. Analyzed, those studying law and politics account for 37.2%, engineering accounts for 9.3%, science accounts for 8.9%, commerce accounts for 4.9%, medicine accounts for 4.3%, and agriculture and forestry account for 3.2%. From this, it can be seen that the development of arts and practical subjects is really unbalanced, in other words, it is distorted development, resulting in a surplus of arts and law talents and a shortage of practical subject talents. In order to remedy this abuse, the Ministry of Education has issued a notice that, except for remote provinces, no more arts and law colleges and universities may be established. The public or private law and politics specialized schools originally planned by various provinces must, by the end of this year, either be changed to practical subjects or be completely closed down. As for the poorly managed arts and law universities or independent schools, they have been ordered to close down, including three schools in Peiping, three schools in Shanghai, and one school each in Nanjing and Guangdong, for a total of eight schools. Recently, the enrollment of arts and law subjects in various universities has also been restricted based on the 21st year method. The main points are: (A) The average number of new and transfer students admitted to each department of the colleges of arts, law, commerce, and education in each university shall not exceed the average number of new and transfer students admitted to each department of the colleges of science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine; (B) The ratio of enrollment in arts, law, commerce, and education subjects to science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine subjects in each independent college shall be the same as that of universities; (C) The number of new and transfer students admitted to each department or specialized course in an independent college specializing in arts, law, commerce, and education shall not exceed 50. The above methods are not applicable to colleges that only accept female students. However, while restricting arts and law subjects, the Ministry of Education is also strongly promoting practical subjects, such as designating Beijing Central, Zhongshan, Qinghua, and Wuhan universities to prepare for the establishment of national defense chemistry chairs, such as ordering the prospective Tongji University to add a College of Science, Qinghua University to add a College of Engineering, and Beiyang Institute of Technology to add a Department of Electrical Engineering. As for practical subject specialized schools, those that have been planned and established include the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Specialized School and the Shandong Provincial Medical Specialized School. As for the effects of the policies implemented by the Ministry of Education in recent years, they can be observed from the various statistics on current students, graduates, and new students.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang University Disturbance Gradually Subsides</h3>
<p>The disturbance that occurred at Zhejiang University a few days ago due to a minor matter has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the disturbance subsided yesterday. Most students, valuing their studies, expressed their unwillingness to participate in excessive actions. All students of the Huajiachi Agricultural College have refused to sign their names, and the six representatives elected have also resigned from the student union. Declarations to protect the school have been found throughout the campus, rejecting the excessive actions of a few students. Students are urged not to engage in unconscious words and deeds. Therefore, if the school's faculty members do not insist on resigning, the Ministry of Education will retain them.</p>

<h3>University Teachers' Association's Opinion on Prohibiting Students from Dancing</h3>
<p>It is Practically Impossible for the Municipal Government to Send Police to Inspect</p>
<p>Only Through Voluntary Reporting by Staff and Students Can It Be Effective</p>
<p>The issue of prohibiting students from going to dance halls to dance has attracted much attention from society since the decision of the university presidents. A reporter from Shanghai News Agency interviewed Mr. Jiang Zhensan, the standing committee member of the University Faculty and Staff Association, to inquire about his opinion on prohibiting dancing. He mentioned that dancing is considered a legitimate form of entertainment in European and American countries, but when young students become addicted to it, they neglect their studies, waste money, and even develop relationships with dance hostesses, leading to excessive behavior. The recent case of Huang Naiwu, a student at a certain university, who splashed acid on someone's face and was involved in legal issues, is an example. Therefore, the university authorities' ban on students dancing is strongly supported by the association, which stands on the position of university professors, and will be assisted. However, according to yesterday's report, the prohibition measures include requesting the municipal government to send police to inspect dance halls and arrest offenders. The speaker believes that this is practically impossible because most of the major dance halls are located in the concessions. Whether Chinese officials can exercise their authority within the concessions is a question. Even if they can exercise their authority, since students do not wear uniforms, it is impossible to identify them as students, and it will have no effect. Therefore, the association believes that, on the one hand, it should encourage students of various universities to report voluntarily, and on the other hand, it should ask the school authorities to send personnel to thoroughly inspect the dance halls. Once identified, they should be severely punished without leniency. Only in this way can it be effective.</p>
<h3>Great China University Held Tenth Anniversary Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>And Held the Inauguration Ceremony of the New School Building</p>
<p>President Wang Eloquently Recounted the Glorious History of Founding the School</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Gave a Speech on the Achievements of Ten Years</p>
<p>Great China University on Zhongshan Road in this city held its tenth anniversary celebration and the inauguration ceremony of the new middle school building yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Central Committee Member Wu Zhihui, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, representatives of the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Education Bureau Jiang Jianbo, Section Chief of the Municipal Government Li Dachao, and university presidents Li Zhaoshi, Liu Zhanen, Xiao Youmei, and school trustees Du Yuesheng, Jiang Wenyu, Jin Daoyin, Zhu Gongjin, Shen Junru, President Wang Boqun, Vice President Ou Yuanhuai, and all faculty, staff, and students, totaling more than 2,000 people. President Wang Boqun presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>First, Chairman Wang Boqun gave the opening speech, stating that the school was formed on June 1, 1924, from a split from Xiamen University. At that time, there was dissatisfaction with the school, which led to a conflict, so a group of students requested to come to Shanghai to organize a new school, named Great China University. The school was located on Xiaoshadu Road, with only three dilapidated houses. However, the teachers and students worked hard, and in 1925, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to investigate and found that the results were very good, and approved the school to continue operating. By 1929, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to investigate again, who said that the progress in the past four or five years was truly surprising. It was not until 1930 that the school moved from Xiaoshadu Road to this location, and after another four or five years of effort, it has become what it is today. As for the future educational policy, the school will advance on three points: first, implement nationalistic education to lead the people to revitalize the Chinese nation; second, promote productive education to ensure that every graduate can be productive; and third, implement scientific education to prevent scientific warfare.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then gave a speech, stating that everyone must have a certain purpose in order to succeed in doing things. Since your school has education as its purpose, it has achieved today's success, unlike others who muddle through without direction. Great China University has achieved this result in just ten years, which shows that if a person is determined, they will surely succeed. If our 450 million compatriots do not live their lives in confusion, do not live their lives vaguely, do not live their lives unconsciously, and do not give up on themselves, then China today would not be in such a state. Looking at the United States' separation from Britain, it has only been sixteen decades. From the Franco-Prussian War to the First World War, only four decades have passed. The Russian Revolution has only been two decades. The Turkish restoration has also only been two decades. Looking at other countries, they have made progress every year in these ten years. However, since the great powers opened China's doors with cannons, ten decades have passed, and in these ten decades, our compatriots have still passed by unconsciously. We are old and approaching our end, but we can only hope that the young students will work hard and strive to revitalize the nation. Subsequently, Wu Zhihui, Chu Minyi, Jiang Jianbo, Li Zhaohuan, and Liu Zhanen gave speeches. Finally, Vice President Ou Yuanhuai gave a thank-you speech, and graduate student Jiang Ziying gave a speech. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. President Wang hosted a banquet for the guests, all faculty and staff, and graduates in the reading room of the middle school, attended by more than 200 people.</p>
<p>Presentation of Souvenirs</p>
<p>1. Mayor Wu Tiecheng presented a plaque and a clock. 2. Mr. Ou Jianbo donated 6,000 yuan as a scholarship fund for the university. 3. Messrs. Lu Jihui, Wu Zelin, Shao Jialin, Sun Haoxuan, Shao Shuangqiu, Chen Zhu, Lan Chunchi, Ma Zongrong, Ma Gongyu, and Tang Qingzeng donated a wooden bridge worth 500 yuan. 4. All faculty and staff of the middle school and high school departments jointly donated 22 terrazzo pillars and street lights, totaling 800 yuan. 5. Graduates serving at the school jointly donated a pavilion and a goldfish pond worth 300 yuan. 6. Capital graduates donated a mirror worth 40 yuan and a flag. 7. Mr. Wang Shufang donated a complete set of Chinese laws and regulations worth 18 yuan. 8. Graduates Gu Shang presented four enlarged 40-inch photographs of the founders of the university, President Wang, Vice President Ou, Mr. Wu Yuqiang, and Mr. Chuan Wushuo, in frames. 9. Graduates Tao Zhi et al. jointly presented a bookshelf with the complete Twenty-Five Histories, worth 44 yuan. 10. The students' association of the College of Education donated 20 yuan in cash. The souvenirs will be used according to the discretion of the tenth-anniversary preparation committee. 11. Graduates Zhou Leshan, Wang Yunshi, Hui Changrong, Song Renkun, and Wang Yukai jointly donated a scholarship of 50 yuan. 12. Graduate Bao Zhining donated four large boxes of Tongzhi. 13. The Great China Alumni Association presented a wooden plaque with the inscription "One Heart, One Virtue." 14. Graduates Shen Lijun et al. presented a wooden plaque with the inscription "When Drinking Water, Remember the Source." 10. Ji Changbao presented a set of fireworks. The Great China Bus Company donated 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Inauguration of the School Building</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the inauguration ceremony of the middle school building was held in the auditorium, presided over by President Wang. The meeting was opened as usual, and then the ceremony was held and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Torchlight Parade</p>
<p>Last night, all students of the school held a torchlight parade, departing at 8:00 PM, passing through Zhongshan Road, along Suzhou Creek to Caojiadu, through Zhaofeng Park, and returning to the school via Zhongshan Road.</p>

<h3>Measurement of Mineral Ore Detection Ability</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Before discussing this article, the theory behind why mineral ore can detect signals must first be explained.</p>
<p>Detection is not limited to using a specific device or substance. Any substance with a rectifying effect can be used for detection. In other words, any substance with unilateral conductivity has a detection function.</p>
<p>Unilateral conductivity means that when current passes through the conductor in one direction, the resistance is very low. When the direction is reversed, the conductor produces a very high resistance, and the current immediately decreases, or even reduces to zero.</p>
<p>The first diagram shows the characteristic curve of a typical detection mineral ore. When the voltage is positive, the current is very large. When it is negative, the current is almost reduced to zero. Therefore, the lower half of the incoming high-frequency AC wave is uniformly cut off, forming a low-frequency pulsating current in a single direction (as shown in Figure 1A).</p>
<p>We know that the earpiece can generate sound waves due to changes in the internal current. The greater the change in the current value, the louder the sound wave produced. If we want the crystal radio to produce a loud sound, the mineral ore must have the smallest possible resistance in one direction and the largest possible resistance in the other direction. To put it more clearly, the larger the difference in current in the two directions under the same voltage, the louder the sound wave produced in the earpiece, and at the same time, the better its sensitivity.</p>
<h3>Figure 1</h3>
<p>The method of measuring the detection ability of mineral ore introduced in this article is designed based on the above-mentioned principle. As shown in Figure 2, V is a voltmeter, and B is a battery of a certain value. First, place the mineral ore at XX and measure it. Assume that the value obtained on the voltmeter is E1. Then, change the direction of the mineral ore and assume that the value obtained is E2. Then:</p>
<h3>Figure 2</h3>
<p>Mineral ore detection ability E1-E2 (positive and negative are acceptable) During testing, if:</p>
<p>1. The current values in both directions are equal—the contact is too tight, or there is an internal short circuit.</p>
<p>2. The difference between the current values in the two directions is too small—the contact is too loose or the contact is at a point that is not very sensitive.</p>
<p>3. There are no values in both directions—the internal contact has not been made, or the contact point has accumulated dirt.</p>
<p>4. The value is unstable—the whisker's elasticity is too loose, or the mineral ore itself is shaking.</p>
<h3>Reducing Noise Transmitted from the Power Source</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>The noise emitted from an AC receiver is sometimes not emitted from the receiver itself, but is caused by transmission from its power line. This kind of noise is naturally disliked by listeners and they are eager to get rid of it. To reduce or eliminate it, one cannot achieve results by modifying the inside of the radio, one must start from the power line.</p>
<p>In fact, eliminating this kind of noise is also extremely easy, but you must add a device like Figure A or B to the power input line. The functions of the two figures are the same, but Figure A has a better effect. The capacitors in the figure each have a capacity of two millionths of a farad, and the best voltage resistance is 500 volts. In Figure A, each radio frequency choke uses 22 to 28 gauge silk-wrapped wire, wrapped 100 turns around a one-inch diameter circular tube. When in use, the two ends on the left are connected to the power line, and the two ends on the right are connected to the power input line on the receiver.</p>
<h3>Repairing Electric Megaphone</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>When an electric megaphone malfunctions, if you have repair knowledge, you can start repairing it immediately, saving you from having to consult others. Therefore, this article is to introduce it to fellow comrades.</p>
<p>To repair an electric megaphone, you must first understand its principle and structure. The reason it can produce sound is entirely due to the voice coil connected to the suspended cone. After passing the audio frequency current, it vibrates in the air to produce sound. The base of the cone is supported on the iron frame, and the spider holds the cone in a central position (please refer to the attached figure, the spider makes the cone always perpendicular to the cone surface when vibrating). The voice coil on top of the cone vibrates in the gap of the magnetic poles. The electromagnet has a mother coil, also called a field coil, to input external DC power to make the excitation magnetic field strong.</p>
<p>The iron shell enclosing the outside of the mother coil not only protects the mother coil, but also completes the function of the magnetic circuit. If the audio current is input into the voice coil to make it an electromagnet, its magnetic lines of force have a reaction with the suspended magnetic field. In other words, the lines of force repel each other, so the cone vibrates with the voice coil, emitting sound.</p>
<p>This type of megaphone is prone to problems such as sandy sound, tremolo, and noise, or sometimes the sound is weak and even inaudible. The causes of these problems and repair methods are described below.</p>
<p>—A— If this seam comes unglued, it must be reglued. If there is a crack, it must be repaired by applying glue or shellac. —B— The spider often breaks here, causing sandy sound. Cut a new spider from cardboard, apply shellac or glue, and replace it. —C— Shim, voice coil, mother coil. The shim keeps the voice coil centered. —D— The comb area often has solder joints that must be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Testing the Mother Coil</p>
<p>The first step in testing a megaphone is to know the strength of the magnetic field. The simplest method is to place a chisel next to the magnetic poles after the megaphone is connected to the radio to see how strong its suction is. If you want to be more accurate, use a precise ohmmeter to measure the ohms of the mother coil (note: a precise milliampere meter can also be used to measure it, using the formula (ohms = volts x 1000 milliamperes). If the coil is broken or part of it is short-circuited, disassemble it and rewind the coil or replace it with a suitable new coil.</p>
<p>In older AC megaphones, the mother coil of the magnetic field uses a copper oxide rectifier to convert AC into DC. After a long time, this type of megaphone becomes weak, so it is necessary to re-test the fixed strength of the magnetic field.</p>
<p>If it is found that the magnetic field is very good, the second step is to test the megaphone's voice coil and cone. However, this work requires extra care. The general problems are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Problems</p>
<p>(1) The voice coil is internally interrupted or broken at the soft wire joint.</p>
<p>(2) The voice coil is partially or completely short-circuited, causing it to bridge together.</p>
<p>(3) The voice coil is skewed and rubs against the magnetic poles.</p>
<p>(4) Crackling sounds are often due to loose seams of the cone, loose glue on the spider or voice coil on the cone: sometimes the voice coil becomes loose and separates from the paper tube.</p>
<p>(5) The voice coil is damp and soft, and the spider support is not properly supported or broken, or the outer edge of the cone is loose, causing a crumbling sound.</p>
<p>The above five points are the main reasons for the megaphone's problems (except for megaphone damage and cone breakage).</p>
<p>Use of Shims</p>
<p>After testing the megaphone, if it is known that the problem is that the voice coil is skewed, the screws holding the spider must be loosened, and a steel shim of suitable thickness must be carefully inserted between the magnetic poles. Please refer to Figure C, then tighten the screws, remove the shim, and the cone can maintain its original central position. If the spider has not moved the cone will not be shifted. About 75% or more of these types of problems can be repaired using this simple method.</p>
<p>If the above method cannot be used, if you have repair tools, remove the cone and test it again. Be careful when removing the cone to avoid any damage. In many new megaphones, the edges of the cone are glued. You must first saturate the edges with solvent, and the glue will gradually come off (it takes about five to ten minutes to loosen the glue). Do not use water, as it will damage the cone and prevent the glue from coming off.</p>
<p>Cone Testing</p>
<p>Once the cone has been removed, it should be thoroughly tested. Loose parts must be regrounded and secured. If the voice coil is deformed and no longer round, insert a suitable round tube, tie it tightly, and apply a thin layer of glue to the surface. It will not be deformed after it hardens. When applying glue, use your fingers to distinguish how thick or thin it is. If it is thin, apply more; if it is thick, wash it off with solvent and reapply.</p>
<p>The cone joints must also be thinly coated with glue. If the spider is found to be damaged, cut it into the shape shown in Figure B and replace it after applying glue or shellac. After regrounding the cone, it must be allowed to dry for about an hour before reinstalling it (the glue can dry in 15 minutes, but it is better to wait an hour before installing it). When installing the cone, the shims must still be inserted, then tighten the screws so that the cone edges are regrounded and secured, and then remove the shims.</p>
<p>Sometimes the voice coil is damaged too severely, in which case only a new one can be replaced and glued to the cone.</p>
<h3>Reinartz Tuner</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>The Reinartz tuner was invented by the German Reinartz. It uses both inductance and capacitance for feedback (regeneration), as shown in the figure below. It has good efficiency and is easy to adjust, so it is widely used for short-wavelength reception. To adjust this circuit, first rotate the antenna transformer A. The antenna intersects the secondary circuit L2 through the coil L1. Then set C3 to zero and adjust L2C2 close to the desired wavelength. Then increase or decrease L3 close to L2, while increasing or decreasing C2 and C3 to find the clearest point of reception. Figures A and B above are also circuits based on the same principle. The matching operation of Figure A is controlled by a variometer. Figure B is a method of winding the inductance coil on the same cylinder. The connection of the antenna is to draw out two, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten turns each at the ground end and arbitrarily select an appropriate point. The magnitude of the feedback is obtained by increasing or decreasing the screen capacitor C1.</p>
<p>Small Experiences</p>
<h3>Uses of Two Stranded Insulated Wires</h3>
<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>Winding two insulated wires together creates a small capacitor, the capacity of which is determined by the length of the two wires wound together. Although it is small, it has many uses. As shown in (Figure 1A), its function is to stabilize the vacuum tube oscillation. Figure B shows how it is made into an antenna compensation capacitor. If you connect the two stranded wires between the moving and fixed plates of the variable capacitor, you can slightly change the reading on the dial. Figure C shows how the wiring diagram changes the wavelength. If a wiring diagram is missing just one turn or half a turn, it is very troublesome to add. If you don't add it, the wavelength is missing a section, or you can't receive the long-wavelength radio station by chance. If you do it as shown in the figure, you will definitely increase some wavelengths.</p>
<h3>Figure 1</h3>
<h3>Grid Leak in Shortwave Machine</h3>
<p>For a grid leak that has been burned out or otherwise failed, we can take the wire removed from a low-frequency transformer or use 38-gauge enameled wire to wind it tightly on the grid (this will create a high-frequency choke). Use tin to solder the two wire heads on the two steel heads of the grid leak, as shown in Figure 2. When finished, put it in a shortwave machine as a grid leak, which not only reduces noise but also greatly improves the reception.</p>
<h3>Short-Circuit Check for Power Transformers</h3>
<p>When we wind our own power transformers, it often happens due to carelessness that the internal coils become short-circuited without us realizing it. If we connect the power cord and notice it early, it's okay, but if we notice it late, there may be a risk of burning it out. Checking for short circuits is not difficult, but it can be troublesome. Here is a very convenient method (as shown in Figure 3). Simply connect a light bulb in series with the primary winding of the transformer and then connect it to the power line. If the light is as bright as usual (or perhaps slightly dimmer because the coil also has considerable resistance), then you can know that a short circuit has occurred inside the coil. If the light is only dimly red, it indicates that there is no short circuit. Therefore, to prevent accidental damage, it is best to try this method.</p>

<h3>Radio Broadcasting in Japan (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cai Guanghua</p>
<p>Listeners</p>
<p>Today, the number of radio listeners in Japan ranks fifth in the world (1. USA, 2. UK, 3. Germany, 4. Russia, 5. Japan). In September 1926, there were only 343,166 listeners nationwide in Japan. By March 1933, this had increased to 1,055,778. By January 1934, it had increased to 1,644,839. However, if this number is compared with the total population of Japan, the distribution of radio broadcasting in Japan cannot be considered widespread, because the average ratio of listeners to the total population is 25 per 1,000. However, Osaka is an exception because it is an industrial area, so its ratio is 44.1 per 1,000, which even the bustling city of Tokyo cannot match. In other quiet villages, there are even people who do not know what a radio looks like.</p>
<p>Listeners must pay a monthly radio fee of 75 sen (approximately 7.5 jiao). Therefore, the association's monthly income from radio fees is considerable. At the request of the government, a portion of this income is used to prevent tuberculosis and other facilities beneficial to the community.</p>
<p>Radios</p>
<p>The most common radio in Japan is the small (Midget Type), which looks similar to the American Emerson, but in fact, the internal vacuum tubes are not as numerous as those in American products (and of course, the technology and usage are also not as good). Because Japan is a small country and broadcasting is coordinated by regulations, long-distance radios are not needed. The number of vacuum tubes in ordinary radios is usually from two to four, mostly 227, 112A, 247, 247B, 224, and 235. The 112B rectifier tube is also very common in Japan. As for loudspeakers, magnetic ones are the most common, but electric ones are also numerous. At the same time, travel-type radios are now gradually becoming fashionable. Crystal radios and DC radios can still be found, but in cities, the supply of AC power is complete, so listeners are of course happy to use AC-powered radios. On the surface, it seems that radio broadcasting in my country is more advanced than Japan. New types of vacuum tubes that are popular in the United States are also popular in my country, but they are not necessarily common in Japan. However, on closer inspection, whether the things that are popular in my country are produced in the Republic of China is a question. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Toys Can Betray the Country</h3>
<p>— Nai Chang</p>
<p>Although games and toys are small things, children, you must not underestimate them. Didn't you see the report from the International Trade Bureau? In the short eight months from January to August this year, the value of games and toys imported into our country from abroad has already reached more than 664,000 yuan!</p>
<p>More than 664,000 yuan is not a small amount. If this continues year after year, wouldn't our money be flowing to foreign countries in just a few years? Looking at it this way, toys can really betray the country! Little friends who are used to using games and toys should check them at any time to see if the toys they are about to buy are foreign goods. If they are foreign goods, they should not be bought!</p>
<p>Therefore, we understand even more clearly that we should focus on the details and start with the small things in everything we do! "There is no greater sorrow than a dead heart!" Children, please pay attention!</p>
<h3>Little Teacher System</h3>
<p>— Shen Shouruo</p>
<p>Mr. Niu Changyao, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Yutang Public Education Center, came to our Nanhui area the day before yesterday to inspect public education. He convened a symposium of public education center directors. Mr. Niu instructed that in the future, public education should use the "little teacher system" to supplement the development of public education with school education, and the effect can be increased.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Niu, the "little teacher system" is to use students with a certain level of education to teach their family members and relatives. This method is very interesting. If it is implemented, it can "change the old tune" of "father teaching his son and brother encouraging his brother."</p>
<p>Children! If you are interested in being a little teacher, then you should save the time you spend playing water chestnuts and kicking shuttlecocks, and work hard to accept the training of your big teachers to enrich your knowledge. Only then can you be competent in the teaching duties of a little teacher, and make your parents love you even more.</p>
<h3>Gorky's Childhood Life</h3>
<p>— Shi Xiang</p>
<p>Children, you probably all know the great Russian revolutionary writer Gorky. His life's great career is worth our twelve points of admiration. But the foundation of this great career was formed in his childhood.</p>
<p>He lost his father at a young age, and he followed his mother to live with his maternal grandparents. His mother didn't treat him well, but his maternal grandmother loved him very much, and he also liked his maternal grandmother very much, because his maternal grandmother could often tell him stories and teach him to read.</p>
<p>Later, Gorky was sent by his maternal grandfather to work as an apprentice in a shoe store. Not long after, he was transferred to work as an apprentice for a book illustrator. He cooked, washed dishes, and swept the floor every day, doing many dirty things without any resentment. But his only hobby was to like novels: every night, he would always hide from people and secretly light an oil lamp and huddle on the bed to read. Therefore, the illustrator's wife was very dissatisfied with him.</p>
<p>When Gorky returned from the illustrator's place, he ran to a ship by himself to work as a stoker and become friends with the tea boys, sailors, and stokers on the ship. When he was free, he would read some novels and listen to stories.</p>
<p>Soon, Gorky returned to his maternal grandmother's house, but his maternal grandmother's family was gradually becoming poor, and his mother also became ill and died! Gorky and his maternal grandmother often went out to collect firewood, pick up trash, and do business, living the life of beggars. ...</p>
<p>Children, Gorky's childhood life was so interesting, but unfortunately I can't write it all at once, so I can't tell you more. But you must understand that the reason why Gorky was able to become a famous writer is because he was not afraid of hardship, he was not afraid of suffering, he studied hard, and he read a lot of novels!</p>
<h3>Remember!</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>Children, remember!</p>
<p>Who brutally murdered your compatriots?</p>
<p>Who seized your land?</p>
<p>Who wants to destroy your country?</p>
<p>To call you his slave!</p>
<p>Children, remember!</p>
<p>National hatred must be avenged!</p>
<p>From today on,</p>
<p>You must work hard to study,</p>
<p>And also forge your body well,</p>
<p>You want to be Yue Fei, whom gold medals cannot recall,</p>
<p>Work hard! Remember!</p>
<h3>Somersault Order</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>Dear little friends, do you think the somersault cloud magic of Sun Dasheng—Sun Wukong in Journey to the West is too great—he can travel 108,000 miles with one somersault! Now I have a "Somersault Order", which, once spoken, can be linked to infinity. Isn't this even more powerful than the somersault cloud of the Monkey King Sun Wukong? If you read on, you can get this magic weapon.</p>
<p>We pick two words that have the same meaning whether read forward or backward, such as "sweet honey", "mom and dad", "good and bad", "black and white", "up and down", etc. If we reverse them to become "honey sweet", "dad mom", "bad good", "white black", "down up", etc., doesn't the original meaning remain unchanged? Just take these two words and, according to the rule of one forward and one backward, add one word at a time—the meaning must still be the same—and add them in a chain like this, forward and backward, and you will feel a deep interest. Look at the example below:</p>
<p>Sweet honey, honey sweet; sweet sweet honey, honey sweet sweet; sweet sweet honey honey, honey honey sweet sweet: sweet sweet honey honey, honey honey sweet sweet...</p>
<p>If you continue to say this, forward and backward, adding and adding, to the point where you are speechless and cannot say it clearly.</p>
<p>When people in our Hangzhou see a child fall and do a somersault, when they go to help him up, they say: "Fall once, Du (that is, Da) once." This somersault order is exactly like the meaning of this sentence!</p>
<p>Dear little friends, come and try it, see how many somersaults you can fall in one breath? Can you be more powerful and magical than Sun Wukong's somersault cloud?</p>
<h3>I Don't Want to Shake Hands with You!</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>A Question</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhen</p>
<p>Gui'er, Ke'er, and Xiu'er were sitting under a large tung tree. Gui'er was telling the "Story of the Rabbit and the Cat". Ke'er and Xiu'er were very happy to listen. Although the story was over, the listeners' interest was not exhausted, and they asked the storyteller to continue. Gui'er had no more stories. So Ke'er and Xiu'er started to make a fuss with Gui'er.</p>
<p>The father heard it and ran out to say, "Children, don't quarrel, I'll tell a story, I'll tell a story." Ke'er and Xiu'er happily stopped quarreling and waited quietly for their father to tell the story. The father sat on the small rattan chair, coughed, and said: "I'll ask a question first, if you can answer it, I'll tell a story."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, Father, tell the story quickly!" The three people said in unison, "Two fathers and two sons went to the mountains to hunt. As a result, they caught three deer. They divided their catches very equally. Do you think they can distribute them equally?" The father said.</p>
<p>Ke'er and Xiu'er couldn't answer, but Gui'er said without thinking: "This is easy, they must be a grandfather and his son and grandson. In terms of family titles, they are two fathers and two sons, but in reality they are still three people."</p>
<p>"Right, right, smart child!" The father stroked Gui'er's head and said, "I'll tell you the story of the bee and ant war."</p>
<h3>Advise Children Not to Smoke Cigarettes</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen many children happily smoking cigarettes, often saving their candy money to buy cigarettes to smoke. This is really not a good thing.</p>
<p>Cigarettes are a consumer product. Smoking them is not only not beneficial, but also harmful. For example, they can easily cause fires, easily damage brain power, and easily harm the throat, causing choking coughs, etc. These are all the harms of cigarettes. Even adults should not smoke them, let alone underage children?</p>
<p>At a time when the New Life Movement is being promoted, some places, such as Nanjing, are banning smoking. I remember that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once saw a ten-year-old child smoking on the road and wanted to punish his parents at the time. As a result, the adults were so frightened that they forbade their children from smoking, and there was no such behavior in that place afterward!</p>
<p>Our compatriots do not pay much attention to education, thinking that there is no harm in children smoking cigarettes once or twice, so they let them smoke. But over time, they will have to smoke! So when they want to smoke for the first time, they should be prohibited from smoking. As for the children themselves, they should realize that cigarettes are not something that children should smoke, and they should absolutely prohibit it. They must not buy them because they think they are beautiful and draw a prize. You must know that it is not easy to get the grand prize, and even if you get the grand prize, it is not worthwhile, because the consumption of smoking is very high.</p>

<h3>How to Pay Attention to Oral Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Ri Zhao</p>
<p>Children, teeth are a very important tool in life, and we cannot do without them when we eat food. So we must always be very careful and cautious to protect them. But some little friends often ignore them and eat those candies that are harmful to the teeth, and they don't know how to take care of them; as a result, they suffer from toothache, tooth loss, and even headaches. How foolish is this!</p>
<p>Children, if you don't want to suffer from toothache, please pay attention to the following items:</p>
<p>(1) You must rinse your mouth once after each meal. If you gargle with borax water for one or two minutes, it will definitely be very clean and beautiful.</p>
<p>(2) The bristles of the toothbrush we use should not be too hard, because too hard can easily break the gums and cause bleeding.</p>
<p>(3) If the gums bleed non-stop, we can burn the lanugo to ashes, apply it to the affected area, and it will be fine.</p>
<p>(4) Use salt to brush your teeth once every night before going to bed to remove the dirt from your mouth. After sleeping, there is no bad breath in your mouth, so you will naturally suffer less from tooth problems.</p>
<p>(5) Bad breath is an annoying problem. We just need to put a lychee pulp in our mouth before going to bed, spit it out after waking up the next day, and it will be effective after ten days.</p>
<p>(6) Finally, what we need to take care of is the water for rinsing, whether in winter or summer, should not be too cold or too hot. Otherwise, it is easy to puncture the teeth and cause bleeding, gradually causing the teeth to become loose and fall out, and you will become an old woman!</p>
<h3>Small Jokes</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhao</p>
<p>(1) Cheating Children</p>
<p>The second landlord's mother-in-law brought two bags of candy and gave them to Min'er. She said; "Sister-in-law, this little bit of something is to cheat the little child: Min'er, take it!"</p>
<p>Min'er said unhappily, "Mom, I don't want it, I definitely don't want it."</p>
<p>The second landlord asked him in surprise; "Min'er, why don't you want it?" Min'er replied, "Because you want to cheat me, it's definitely not a good intention."</p>
<p>(2) One More Day!</p>
<p>Min'er is a greedy child. When the teacher was issuing holiday slips for National Day, he wanted two. The teacher felt very strange and said to him: "Min'er, what's the use of you wanting one more?"</p>
<p>Min'er replied, "Teacher, if you want one more, you can have one more day off."</p>
<p>(3) Greedy Min'er.</p>
<p>The teacher asked in the arithmetic class: "What is one-tenth?" The students couldn't answer. The teacher smiled and said: "Let me give you an example, if you give ten people an apple, how would you divide it?"</p>
<p>Min'er stood up from the last row and said: "According to my method, after the other nine people go home, I will eat it myself."</p>
<h3>Children's Creed</h3>
<p>— Xing Sheng</p>
<p>(1) Get up early and go to bed early.</p>
<p>(2) Keep your body clean and your clothes neat.</p>
<p>(3) Eat at fixed times and in fixed amounts, and don't eat snacks.</p>
<p>(4) Speak honestly and clearly, and don't talk nonsense about things you don't know.</p>
<p>(5) Do not take other people's things without their permission.</p>
<p>(6) Do not rely on others for things you can do yourself.</p>
<p>(7) Do not buy foreign goods.</p>
<p>(8) Do not waste money, time, and supplies.</p>
<p>(9) Be filial to your parents, respect your teachers, and love your friends.</p>
<p>(10) Admit your mistakes and improve quickly.</p>
<p>(11) Do not talk about your own good points, and do not talk about other people's bad points.</p>
<p>(12) If others bully me, use proper methods to deal with it.</p>
<p>(13) Read useful books diligently.</p>
<h3>Why Do Fallen Leaves Turn Yellow?</h3>
<p>— Ku</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the leaves of a plant, when they grow on branches, are mostly green. When they are about to separate from the branches, they turn yellow. It seems very strange. We must know that the green color on the leaves is because there is a kind of chlorophyll in the leaves. This kind of chlorophyll is made by the power of sunlight and the absorption of carbon dioxide. When the leaves leave the branches, they lose this function and cannot absorb carbon dioxide, so they cannot produce chlorophyll. The original chlorophyll evaporates, leaving only a pale and thin yellow.</p>
<h3>Correspondence for Rural Children</h3>
<p>— Zi Ming</p>
<p>Autumn Deepens</p>
<p>Dear children:</p>
<p>Autumn is deepening, the fragrance of osmanthus is saying goodbye to us: all the flowers have gone home.</p>
<p>Then, is this natural world desolate? The Creator will never make people feel monotonous. Look! The leaves of the maple tree have changed from green to red: they are dancing in the wind and waves, like thousands of butterflies meeting. How much fun!</p>
<p>Children: Do you know the cause of red leaves? Use a microscope to observe the cross-section of a leaf, and you can see that the cell sap in some of the epidermis and mesophyll tissue contains a red liquid. This red liquid is a kind of anthocyanin, which turns into a bright red color when diluted with hydrochloric acid. If you inject alkaline liquid, it will still turn green. These are all due to the reaction of anthocyanins. Then put it in hot water (the green chlorophyll in the leaves is not easily soluble in water) and the water will become red.</p>
<p>The chrysanthemums of the eastern fence proudly bloom: adding a lot of color to the desolate flower world! The yellow ones are like gold, the white ones are like silver, and the red and purple ones are all dazzling! Feast your eyes on the beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting cooler, and colder. I hope you all take care of yourselves!</p>
<h3>Children of the Whole World</h3>
<p>— Wen Yuyang</p>
<p>(1) Spanish children often wear colorful clothes and dance with drums in their hands. This is their daily game. We can often see their uniquely flavored Spanish folk dances in theaters.</p>
<p>(2) The most famous ancient site in Egypt is the pyramids. Children must know this. Look at the costumes of the children there, how strange! It's like the ancient costumes we see in picture books.</p>
<p>(3) Malay children live in the tropics. Their costumes are similar to those of children in our countryside, but their shapes are completely different. Their skin is brown and they like to eat coconuts.</p>
<p>(4) In the southwestern part of our country, like Guangxi and Guizhou, there are Miao people, whose lives are as barbaric as those of primitive people. The children there often like to wear red and green clothes and sing and dance in groups.</p>

<h3>Financial Balancing Tax Causes Large Increase in Gold Price by Four Dollars and Forty Cents</h3>
<p>Trading Suspended for Autumn Races After Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday</p>
<p>After three consecutive days of slight declines in the gold market, a rebound finally occurred yesterday. However, due to the rise in both the silver market and exchange rates, the opening market was still weak. Once the Central Bank's white silver balancing tax was announced, it was set high by half a cent, which stirred up sentiment. As a result, buying interest intensified, and the market closed firm. Initially, overseas silver markets in both the UK and US rose, and forward silver prices also increased by 2.5%. Exchange rates continued to rise, and London spot gold fell by one penny. The opening price in the local pre-market was 834 yuan, but buyers were eager and able to push the price up. When the Central Bank announced its rates, the UK and US were flat, and the import duty was slightly higher by one cent. The standard gold price was 991.2 yuan. The morning opening was still low. After the opening, banks traded with each other. The exchange market stabilized, and sentiment became ordinary, causing the gold market to fluctuate. When the HSBC bank announced its rates for the UK and US, they remained unchanged. The Central Bank and HSBC negotiated recent US dollar exchange rates, which were still fluctuating. Once the Central Bank's white silver balancing tax was announced, rising to 7.75%, using a calculation of one shilling four pence and eight one two five, sentiment was boosted, and buying interest was even more intense. The market became firm. Although banks continued to supply gold, Chinese merchants were in good spirits and actively sought to secure deals. Although gold prices fluctuated, the overall trend was gradually upward, but due to limited transactions, the rise was slow and did not break through the 90 yuan mark. Later, a large amount of supply emerged to take advantage of the high prices, causing prices to fall again. However, the situation remained stable at midday. The morning market was initially weak but later firm. This was a turnaround after three consecutive days of declines. In reality, the overall trend was still fluctuating. Trading volume in the morning was still low, with only over 25,000 taels traded. The total number of December chips decreased in value to 29,000. Next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday coincide with the Western merchant autumn race period. Banks will be closed, and the Gold Exchange will also be closed in the afternoon during these three days. The morning market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 984.3 yuan, down 40 cents from the previous close, then 3.8 yuan. Shunmao, Dafu, Yongfuxing, and Yongheng Yujin rose to 5.2 yuan.

The exchange rate for the Huifa bank was announced, with the UK and US both flat. The Central Bank bought US dollars at 4.375 from Hua Bi. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongfuchang, and Dingchang, etc., bought bars, rising to 6.1 yuan. Zhengjin closed January US dollars at 3.75. The Dalian gang Hengyu sold slightly, lowering the price to 5.2 yuan. Later, the Central Bank's white silver balancing tax was announced, rising to 7.75%, which boosted sentiment.

Hengchang, Yongqian, Changxiang, and Yuanyi, etc., sold off, lowering the price to 7.3 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongfuyu, and Shangjin rose to 8.8 yuan. Soon after, Hua Bi released December US dollars at 3.125. Fuxing, Yongyuanfeng, and Yong all sold off, lowering the price to within 8 yuan. Qianchang, Xiang Dingkang bought bars at low prices, and the price was able to rise again. Yuli and Chunyuanyong, etc., bought aggressively, and the price rose to 90 yuan at one point. Fuxingyong, Tianfeng, Hengyu, Fuchang, Yongdeshunli, etc., took advantage of the high prices to sell bars together, gradually falling back to 8.1 yuan. Yongli, Chunyuanyong, and Yuanmao Yong continued to buy at low prices, and the situation remained stable. The midday close was 989.1 yuan. After the close, the market was stable, fluctuating around 9 yuan. The highest price during the morning was 990 yuan, and the lowest price was 983.8 yuan, with a total fluctuation of 6.2 yuan. As a result, the price rebounded by 4.4 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, retreated to 991.6 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 3 yuan lower, and 5 yuan lower than the previous close. The old standard for November, with the HSBC Bank's US dollar exchange rate unchanged, was still calculated at 32.6875, equivalent to a standard gold price of 1058 yuan with some change. The registered prices for this month are 989 yuan for December, and 989 yuan for morning cash adjustment, and 994.3 yuan for gold. The spot market was sluggish, with little trading. Tianjin goods were generally priced at an additional 11 yuan per 'dou'. Swaps were also quiet, with no formal transactions heard of. As for government bonds, due to the week, shorts were unwound today, and buyers must buy in on Monday.</p>
<p>Trading within the market remained weak. According to the summary, Fuyu Ding Dingchang Renfa Yongfu Taiheng Fu An Senchang Yong Da Changxiang Chunyuanyong Richang Dadecheng Qianchangxiang, etc., were on the selling side.

Shunli together did about 300, making it out. The Guang gang Shengbaihengxing had minimal buying and selling. The total number of transactions for the day was only 25,396.</p>

Buyers included Yuan Yi with over 400 contracts, Yifengyong and Tianfeng with over 100 each, and Qianchangxiang, Yuanheng, Fuan, Bingxing, Fuyu, Changsheng Yongda De Cheng Daxing Yong with fewer contracts. Sellers included Yingfenghang with under 600 contracts, Shengbai with over 200, Tianfeng with over 100, and Tongfenghang Dingtai scattered. The total number remaining was 1,008 contracts, with a total of eleven long positions and four short positions.</p>

<p>Copper Coins Suddenly Reduced by 4,000 Cash</p>
<p>Yesterday, small Jiang Jiao silver coins were 828 yuan in both the morning and afternoon, slightly higher by one yuan compared to the previous day. In terms of transactions, there were 6,000 jiao in the morning and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon.

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Alone Rose by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw no significant gains or losses, with a steady fluctuating trend that was not worth mentioning. The accumulated weakness of sentiment made it difficult to boost in the short term, but the favorable environment did not give opportunities to bears. Therefore, based on the current situation, it is expected to continue to hold steady, but trading volume may remain stagnant for the time being. Yesterday, the opening in the morning lacked enthusiasm, and transactions in various bonds were few. There was only one board listed, with mostly small-scale swap trading. Prices showed a slight decline of 0.05 to 0.2 yuan, but the second board showed a slight rebound. The market for the 50th and 53rd issues saw some buying, and the fluctuating trend remained unchanged. The afternoon boards continued to be steady, with slight inconsistencies. The overall trend of the day can be described as fluctuating with a slight upward bias, except for the Sixth Public Bond, which was relatively active. This continuous fluctuation without significant ups and downs has led to increasingly idle sentiment, which will inevitably lead to a further reduction in trading volume. The longer the fluctuation lasts, the greater the danger, but for the time being, there are unlikely to be any major changes. The final prices showed that, except for a few with slight gains, the rest were slightly better by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. Only the Sixth Public Bond rose by 0.5 yuan. The total trading volume was 6,465,000 yuan, and 361 shares of stock. A table comparing the results of the gains and losses is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share).</p>
<p>New York Stocks Rise Sharply</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that New York stocks rose yesterday (2nd), mainly because the pressure on railway stocks has disappeared, with several special stocks rising by as much as 5 yuan. Commercial news was mixed, with both good and bad. The bond market was slightly firmer, and the small exchange also rose due to the firmness of securities and goods. Chicago wheat rose due to strong spot prices, strong overseas markets, and unfavorable wheat crop news. The total trading volume for the day was 650,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Strong Sentiment for Receiving Recent Yarn Shipments</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, but market sentiment was slightly weaker in the afternoon. One company's desire to receive shipments of yarn in recent months remained strong. At the same time, demand for spot yarn was still good, which boosted sentiment. There were still more than 20,000 bales of yarn in warehouses, but most currently say that total Shanghai yarn stocks are around 90,000 bales, with those holding long positions being more active.</p>
<p>The Rising Trend of Golden Rooster Futures Ends</p>
<p>The spot yarn market continued to rise at the opening, due to the strong desire of the Tongcheng Company to receive shipments this month.

<p>Spot Cotton Continues to Rise with the Yarn Market</p>
<p>The cotton market turned firm, with US cotton rebounding. At the same time, gold prices were stable and exchange rates were unchanged, so market sentiment was flat. However, the yarn market rose, and the market was stimulated to rise. However, spot cotton sales in the market were still scattered.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Also Improved by 0.3-0.4 Jiao</p>
<p>The spot cotton market opened higher, due to the rebound in US cotton and the rise in the yarn market, causing the cotton market to rise. Buying interest was slightly stronger, and all months rose by 0.3-0.4 jiao. Market conditions stabilized in the afternoon, and as a result, all months were unchanged.

<p>—Also Mentioning Restrictions… October Cotton Futures Continue to Rise—</p>
<p>New York cotton market, new cotton continued to be strong, with October futures rising 13 points, while old cotton only rose 6 points. Senator Smith is proposing a plan to limit production next year, causing many to shift recent positions to distant positions. Spot merchants are buying December contracts, and overseas buyers are also strong. The Liverpool market is showing a good trend, so it opened higher. The market is progressing and sentiment is good. Last week, yarn factories purchased a total of 247,000 bales of cotton, with spot prices rising 5 points and futures rising 6-13 points. UK cotton futures rose 1-3 points. Indian cotton weakened due to long position liquidations and sales by Japanese merchants, with Pingguo falling 7.5 annas and Aomula and Bailuoxi falling 1 rupee. The original telegraphic record is on the left (telegram from the 2nd).</p>
<p>US Cotton Was Unstable Last Week</p>
<p>A New York telegram on the 2nd reported on the cotton market during the week, stating that the cotton market was unstable last week. The discount on new cotton reappeared after several years, which often affects the spot position and may raise the price of next season's supply. However, the authorities have not yet finalized the cotton production plan for 1935. It is rumored that the plan will allow for a slight increase in the area of fields, and the production of substitutes abroad will also increase, and foreign cotton fields will also increase again next season. The government's farmland management method is expected to be finalized before December 1, and it will be up to farmers to decide whether to continue Peng Hai's proposal next season. It will soon be clear. Spot sales are sluggish, but the basis price is quite stable. The weekend statistics for US cotton are as follows (unit: thousands of bales):</p>
<p>US Cotton Private Estimates</p>
<p>A New York telegram on the 2nd reported that the Fancheer Publishing Office's estimate for this year's production is 9,563,000 bales, with 7,800,000 bales already ginned. The previous estimate (October 3) was 9,710,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Grains: Another Australian Wheat Deal, Flour and Wheat Futures Weaken After Initial Strength</h3>
<p>After the morning opening, the flour market showed an initial stabilization followed by a decline. The foreign wheat quotes were still good, with Chicago up 0.2-0.4 yuan and Canada up 0.4 yuan. Therefore, at the opening, the market for this month was high, with the opening price at 0.43 yuan and December also rising by 0.015 yuan. Later, the months declined because of unimpressive buying interest and the manufacturer has been heavily outputting for the past few days, thus many are taking a wait-and-see approach. As a result, after the second board, each month gradually declined, falling about 0.02 yuan compared to the initial board. The afternoon opening saw the market not improving, despite each board being quiet and manufacturers rarely selling. However, a certain factory continued to order a shipment of Australian wheat at a cheap price of 4.91 yuan, so while sellers were not prevalent, most buyers were limited. As a result, the November and December closings fell by 0.0175 yuan, January fell by 0.015 yuan, February fell by 0.02 yuan, and March and April fell by 0.025 yuan.</p>
<p>After the morning and afternoon openings, the wheat market showed an initial stability followed by weakening. The morning boards were stable because foreign wheat quotes continued to be good, up 0.2-0.4 yuan. However, the outside buying interest was weak, so the market was lifeless. In the afternoon, the flour market rose and then fell, and there was news of another shipment of Australian wheat, so selling was scarce but there was difficult raising the sentiment. So the trend fluctuated, and there was fear of changes in the future. As a result, this month was down 0.02 yuan, December was down 0.01 yuan, January was down 0.04 yuan, and February was up 0.02 yuan. The spot wheat market was still stable, with Shandong Mingguang Wuhe Tang City Haizhou wheat opening at 3.82 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 3.8 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat at 3.75 yuan, with 12,000 bags going to Fuxin and 2,000 bags going to Fufeng.</p>
<p>Frequent Bad News in the Foreign Wheat Market</p>
<p>There is a risk of decay in Argentinian wheat, and locusts are afflicting the Asian wheat region, so wheat prices have risen by more than 0.01 yuan. Corn also improved slightly. The Winnipeg market was stable, with prices advancing by 0.01 yuan, but there was some doubt about the market there, as prices seemed to be falling back. However, the firm spot market is expected to provide considerable support to the market in the near future.</p>
<p>Both Thin Rice and Scattered Sales Are Weak</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for various groups became scarce. About six stone of goods arrived for the 35th and 36th issues. The thin rice sales market was still quiet, with limited retail appetite, and only the Qingdao group procured over 300 bags. Sellers have different thoughts, with those holding firm and those eager to sell. The market is confused, but the results are weak. Although the purchase appetite for the thick new japonica rice of Yebai rice is not as high as before, it is firm due to the lack of Su Tong japonica rice, and there are good quotes occasionally. Du Yangjian's supply and demand are similar, without strong prices, and the Yinyuan moves with the hidden accounts, and the market is fresh, but the Bianyuan is still firm.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 28-29 boats of goods arrived from He Xia Nei Lu from the groups. Market sales of various colors, new japonica, new Du Jian, new Chen Baiyuan, Yinyuan, and new Chen Buke Jian were slightly more active, while broken japonica thin rice prices eased slightly. New Yang Jian, early rice, new Chen Buke Jian were normal. The market of new japonica was weak and tired in the morning and tighter in the afternoon. Broken japonica thin rice went down by 0.2 yuan. High-quality new Du Jian was tight, with medium-quality prices steady. New Chen Baiyuan, new Yangjian Yinyuan, and new Chen Buke Jian did not show much movement, and early rice weakened a bit.</p>
<p>Customer Xian and Foreign Rice Sales Are Brisk</p>
<p>Yesterday, the ocean-going customer followed the flat at the start, the price went upwards and then made a jump again. The enthusiasm of the market and the enthusiasm of the population are all looking forwards on a good future to increase prices. Yesterday there were shipments from the Yangtze River area, Xiang, Han, and Shashi. The ocean-going rice had two to three small batches of arrivals, estimated to be 200 tons of Siamese rice arriving from Liangzhou ships, and more than 2,000 bags of Hong Kong broken rice and Annam japonica rice from Taigu and Yihe ships, and 5,000 bags of Saigon rice from the French company's ships. As the goods were being shipped from various roads to the port, the mainland and the local area were watching and not going forwards, intending to press down the price. So the trading was very light after the opening in the morning, and all the rice had signs of going down again, but once it was noon, the mainland was busy running various strongly. It is estimated that 6,500 bags of rice were opened from Xiang, E, and other rice; the rice shop greedyly handled ocean-going rice, and opened strongly 7,000 bags of Saigon and 1,700 bags of Annam rice. It is true that the need is high, so it is difficult to ignore it, and each rice is secretly held for 0.3-0.5 cents.</p>
<p>It is also said that ocean-going merchants are calling for premium rice at 4.95 yuan for the instant shipment, which is being sold by Yuanli. 1,000 tons was fixed to be talked about at 5.19 yuan in March, because the insurance has not been settled, nothing has been agreed.</p>
<p>Chongming Red Beans Rise Again by 0.8 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the new miscellaneous grains were listed, the selling price has been more dishonorable than honorable, but Chongming sand red is an exception, it was listed for only ten days and the market price rose by 1.4 yuan. Yesterday there were 31 bags in total, handled by two households, and the market price opened at 7 yuan first, then made 7.4 yuan, which is an increase of 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day. Red grains were also tightly rising, and red shell grains opened at 3.09 yuan yesterday, and the market price continued to increase by 0.02 yuan and was sold from the car. The source of new and old yellow beans decreased, the market in the place of origin was tight, and the merchants mostly traded to maintain prices, so the market was stable. The whole city traded cars and each bean, 8-9 cars, sold by mainland streets and Fuzhou and Ningbo gangs.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market New Trend: Green Sugar Production Surges</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the powdered sugar market was sluggish due to it being Saturday, with even fewer transactions. The guild quoted the original price for No. 24 raw granulated white sugar, spot goods, and goods from this warehouse, but no transactions occurred. Re-exported goods were priced at $5.42.2, with another 200 bags offered. Dutch raw sugar was quoted at the original price, but there were few buyers. Zhenyu No. 1 factory white sugar opened at $17, down another 2 cents. Chaoqing brokers offered over a hundred bags of newly arrived white sugar for direct extraction at $12.60, also down 2 cents. It was noted that the quantity of oil-packed sugar was already limited, but brokers were buying and selling on the fly with no intention of stockpiling, resulting in no transactions. It is rumored that new Chaoqing sugar will enter the market around the Beginning of Winter. According to letters from the producing areas, this winter's output is expected to increase by one-tenth compared to last year, with the total amount estimated to be around 800,000 piculs.</p>
<h3>Over 400 Bolts of Woolen Fabrics Were Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend for woolen fabrics was quite good, with over 400 bolts being traded in the city. A small number were inter-street trades, but most were directly purchased by tailors specializing in Western-style clothing. Cavalry twill and herringbone fabrics accounted for over 50 bolts, Yuan Changping thick woolen fabric over 100 bolts, dotted double-sided overcoat fabrics over 60 bolts, and tweed and color-thread overcoat fabrics together over 30 bolts. The remainder was purchased by gangs from Chongqing, Jiangxi, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Anqing, and other regions.

<h3>Hardware: American Tinplate Stocks Low, Demand High</h3>
<p>Since the successive arrival of German and Italian tinplate, the outlet for American tinplate has suffered a major blow. Manufacturers, in an effort to reduce labor and materials, have been forced to use German and Italian goods as substitutes. Buyers also consider the American prices too high and are switching to German and Italian goods. Although the American goods are not completely hopeless, recent conditions, due to low stock levels, have created a state of high demand. The standard price has had to be raised due to tight conditions. Currently, single-layer 90-pound tinplate is priced at $16.50, 100-pound at $17.50, double-layer 90-pound at $32.50, and 100-pound at $35. It is said that sales on this street are remarkably good and exports are also widespread. Therefore, with no expected arrival of goods, prices are expected to continue to rise.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Abortion in Criminal Law</h3>
<p>— Qun Hui</p>
<p>Abortion, like all other anti-social acts, is bound to occur under an unsound social system – yet it is a special phenomenon. It is extremely natural for women to become pregnant and give birth. If there were no unreasonable and coercive social causes, this anti-social and unnatural act of abortion would never occur. This is a very obvious truth.</p>
<p>The law is nothing more than a way of reasoning, but lawmakers often overlook the social causes of a certain criminal act and only deal with the consequences caused by those causes. This is like pressing a stone on the roots of grass that are secretly growing, which is ineffective. Currently, all countries in Europe and America—except the Soviet Union—strictly prohibit abortion as a criminal act, but the number of abortion practitioners and even abortion providers has increased rather than decreased, eventually reaching a point where it is impossible to prohibit.</p>
<p>Recently, the Legislative Yuan has been formulating our country's criminal law, and the issue of abortion has naturally been brought up in the criminal law. The members of the Legislative Yuan have, as usual, established a "Chapter 24, Crime of Abortion" in the criminal law, and specifically formulated the following criminal laws:</p>
<p>"Article 283. (1) A pregnant woman who takes medicine or uses other methods to induce an abortion shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than six months, detention, or a fine of not more than one hundred yuan. (2) A pregnant woman who complies with others inducing an abortion shall be subject to the same penalty."</p>
<p>Judging from this law, a pregnant woman is not allowed to have an abortion regardless of how important the reasons may be, even if the woman's life is at risk due to childbirth. This simply treats women as "machines that can have children" and does not recognize women's human rights at all. Childbirth is certainly important for society, but the survival of the women themselves is even more important. In other words, women are "people" with independent personalities and must never sacrifice themselves for the sake of childbirth. Under unavoidable social causes, abortion should never be regarded as a criminal act. At least in the modern so-called civilized century, such unreasonable legal provisions have no value of existence at all. No wonder some members of the Legislative Yuan have raised objections.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Kunlun's opinion on this article is very correct. He said: "(1) Pregnant women should be allowed to have abortions due to illness, (2) abortions can also be performed due to economic difficulties, children born to families that cannot afford to raise them are undernourished, born but not raised, raised but not developed, which goes against the intention of propagating the nation. We advocate propagating the population, not a nation full of sick or uneducated people." Although this does not stand from the standpoint of women's rights, but from the so-called "propagation of the nation," he at least grasped the social causes of why abortions are necessary.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Jiao Yitang came to "advocate maintaining the original proposal," and his reason is "abortion is contrary to customs, and to maintain public welfare, it should be strictly restricted" (see the Central News Agency's telegram on the amendment to the criminal law by the Legislative Yuan on October 27 for details). Mr. Jiao stands from the standpoint of so-called "customs" and so-called "public welfare" and wants to "strictly restrict" abortion.</p>
<p>However, what is this so-called custom? The "customs" currently prevalent in China, especially the customs regarding the relationship between men and women, are not all the things like "respecting men and despising women" and "three obediences and four virtues" created by feudal patriarchy? Although we have overthrown the Qing Dynasty, the customs of the Qing Dynasty are still preserved. It is precisely because of preserving this worst custom that unnatural facts such as abortion occur. This point cannot be understood by Mr. Jiao and others. As for the so-called "public welfare," it is an even more abstract and empty argument. Is abortion harmful to the "public welfare" of men or the "public welfare" of women? Women, due to various social causes that prevent them from giving birth, take the blood and flesh from their own wombs. This is an unavoidable and concrete fact, and it is the woman's legitimate right to dispose of herself. The so-called "public welfare" of a patriarchal society must never be used to control women's fertility.</p>
<p>Usually, the law takes the so-called "national reproduction" or "national strength" as the biggest premise. Under this major premise, encouraging childbirth and even forcing childbirth are examples in various countries. After the European War, European countries had measures to encourage childbirth or force marriage, especially in Italy and Germany, which are ruled by fascism, and this policy is particularly prominent. In these countries, abortion is of course strictly prohibited, but they are not one-sided in prohibiting it. On the other hand, they specifically set up a maternal protection system, childbirth bonuses (such as in Italy), or the state guarantees the employment of pregnant women or their husbands (such as in Germany). However, in our China, whether in urban or rural areas, most women are constantly unemployed, their lives are fundamentally unstable, and the state does not guarantee the economic lives of pregnant women. As a result, most poor families are forced to "give birth but not raise, raise but not develop," and even sell their children. These are undeniable realities. Therefore, before the state uses laws to prohibit abortion, it must at least have the following strategies to prevent abortion:</p>
<p>(1) Guarantee the economic stability of pregnant women's lives.</p>
<p>(2) Protect maternity, that is, recognize the special social rights of maternity.</p>
<p>(3) The state is responsible for the education and upbringing of children.</p>
<p>(4) Abolish the system of illegitimate children.</p>
<p>Regarding the motives for abortion, Mr. Zi Jiu cited the following four types in his article "Abortion" published in the 31st issue of this journal: "(1) Trapped in economic inability to educate and raise children, (2) Enthusiastic about career, thereby reducing the trouble of raising children, (3) Physically weak, unable to bear childbirth, (4) Lost virginity and pregnant, afraid of social slander, or no one is responsible for raising children, etc." These motives are unavoidable facts caused by the objective social environment and are definitely not the subjective wishes of the women themselves. Therefore, before the social causes are completely eliminated, no matter how the law "strictly restricts" abortion according to Mr. Jiao Yitang's opinion, it will eventually not be able to resist the compulsion of realistic social affairs. People will still "secretly" have abortions. As a result, the law will not only become a dead letter, but will also cause all kinds of diseases in society, which cannot be cured.</p>
<p>We know that women in the Soviet Union now have the freedom to have abortions, and there are public institutions for safe abortions. However, except for a very small number of people who have abortions due to special reasons—such as infectious or maternal diseases or job relationships—most women like to have children. The reasons for this are: First, pregnant women are specially protected by the state; second, the state is responsible for the education and upbringing of children; third, there is no so-called differential treatment for illegitimate children. Therefore, they not only do not want to have abortions, but also hope to have more children.</p>
<p>In short, instead of restricting abortion by law, it is more appropriate to seek to eliminate the social causes that drive women to have abortions!</p>
<h3>How are Prostitutes Produced?</h3>
<p>— Tie Ming</p>
<p>So-called "humanitarianism" is fundamentally non-existent in today's capitalist society. Look at the calls to ban prostitution and abolish brothels, which have been shouted for who knows how long. Not only have they not had any practical effect, but the number of prostitutes is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Recently, the arrests of prostitutes by the Public Works Department police are the same. Not only can they not prevent brothels or reduce the number of prostitutes, but they also have no ability to solve the livelihood problems of prostitutes.</p>
<p>Every day after dusk, on the side of busy streets or in quiet alleys, we can see groups of underage prostitutes, pretending to be coy and shy, enticing passers-by, allowing lustful men to choose. Tianyunlou, Lequan, ... all seem to be "human meat markets," filled with many prostitutes who are miserably red and sadly green. Although it is said that they are more advanced than the prostitutes standing on the street, in fact, their pain is no different.</p>
<p>Do women willingly become prostitutes from the bottom of their hearts? How are prostitutes produced? These, these, are very clear to people who have a knowledge of social issues.</p>
<p>There are two conditions for the emergence of prostitutes: (1) Appearance conditions - society needs prostitutes; (2) Subjective conditions - women become prostitutes to solve their livelihood problems. In the morbid current society, these two conditions are met, so society produces many brothels and prostitutes who sell their bodies.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about why society needs prostitutes? This is an appearance social problem. If this problem is studied in detail, it cannot be explained clearly in a few words. For the convenience of research, I will simply list it as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Because the vast majority of the working masses are restricted by material conditions and cannot afford to marry a wife; but they, like ordinary people, have physiological needs and need sexual solutions, so they often visit prostitutes.</p>
<p>(2) Rich capitalists cannot get used to a monotonous life of monogamy, but they wear masks and are unwilling to take concubines. In order to pursue sexual satisfaction, they can only visit prostitutes.</p>
<p>(3) Some bureaucrats and politicians are tired of living with wives and concubines, but their violent animal desires have nowhere to vent. In order to seek a little new enjoyment, they go to prostitutes.</p>
<p>(4) There are also some vagrants who leave their families and say goodbye to their wives and drift to other places due to the drive of money. After a long time, they cannot suppress their sexual impulses, so they have to visit prostitutes.</p>
<p>(5) There are also some young people who are dissatisfied with their own marriages and cannot get rid of them due to family or social relations. They suffer a major mental stimulus, so they implement passive resistance and visit prostitutes to satisfy their sexual desires.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Isn't the condition that society needs prostitutes very obvious? So, let us talk again about how women become prostitutes? This fact is also clearly placed before our eyes.</p>
<p>In the current society dominated by men, all production institutions are occupied by men, and women have become appendages of men - or a part of property. They are played by men and used to make men happy before they can obtain living materials. Since this is the case, most men in modern China (and the world) cannot afford to marry wives, which naturally creates a surplus of women. Women have no economic status in society, nor do they have special production skills, but their stomachs are the same as men's, and they are often hungry; unable to resist the coercion of hunger, they can only sell their bodies and become prostitutes.</p>
<p>Moreover, China has been plagued by natural and man-made disasters year after year, and the total bankruptcy of the rural economy has led to the decline of cities and the depression of industry and commerce. The number of unemployed people is increasing day by day, and women cannot find jobs in general, which is a special feature of current society. Driven by life, do they still care about the so-called "propriety, justice, integrity, and sense of shame"? These are subjective conditions, and they are not willing to engage in this business from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to , ban and abolish prostitutes, we must require women to occupy a considerable position in the social economy—to be able to find considerable occupations. If we want women to be able to find occupations, we must require the liberation of women; if women want to seek freedom and liberation, as Yao Feiqun said in the previous issue, it is necessary to reform the current society first. In other words, to prevent brothels and ban prostitution, we can only find ways to solve the subjective and objective conditions of the existence of prostitutes, otherwise, prostitutes will only increase day by day and will never be eliminated.</p>
<h3>To My Sister</h3>
<p>— Written by Kyosan Aiko, translated by Tanimine</p>
<p>Sister, Comrade,</p>
<p>What are you waiting for as you lie motionless in bed?</p>
<p>I know,</p>
<p>You are waiting for the return of the person whose eyes are shining.</p>
<p>And, so as not to miss a single word of that blood-like report,</p>
<p>You must struggle to get up from your unfree body.</p>
<p>You, who have been treated as a monster since you were a child,</p>
<p>Sister, who has been injured on the road of struggle,</p>
<p>Thinking of your life, when you can't even afford a copper-plate candy,</p>
<p>I want to save even the tram fare, which is not enough for my purse.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>Wage cuts, longer hours, business closures,</p>
<p>I, who am constantly struggling in this flood of unemployment,</p>
<p>Where can I find a penny to spare?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, but, brave sister,</p>
<p>Because you are the daughter of a tenant farmer,</p>
<p>You and I, who have always been despised,</p>
<p>To our mother, who has been squeezed dry like bean dregs,</p>
<p>To our father, who only allows us to do legal movements,</p>
<p>Let us use practice to explain that everything is possible!</p>
<p>Explain that there is only one road in front of us.</p>
<p>That is, under the insane violence,</p>
<p>Crossing everything, our banner advances.</p>
<p>Sister,</p>
<p>Cheer up and sing a song together.</p>
<p>Don't think about candy,</p>
<p>Let's sing your favorite song————</p>
<p>Look at the sky, lit up by the morning glow,</p>
<p>The day of victory is coming soon…………</p>

<h3>About Homosexuality</h3>
<p>— You Bai</p>
<p>So-called homosexuality is not limited to women, nor does it only occur in modern times. It once prevailed during the heyday of Roman civilization; Lesbos Island in Asia Minor, the source of Greek civilization, was even more popular at one time. This island has produced many writers and philosophers, among whom the most famous is the female writer Sappho. She described homosexuality in detail and promoted it, which made the evil trend of homosexuality spread throughout the island.</p>
<p>This abnormal love phenomenon often occurred in the nunneries of the Middle Ages. Their ambiguous lives are often described in detail in literature. The evil trend has spread throughout the world, which is beyond our imagination.</p>
<p>There are quite a few people in Paris who indulge in this bad habit. There are clubs dedicated to homosexuality, which are organized. But they pay great attention to cleanliness and hygiene, so society does not regard it as a crime.</p>
<p>In recent years, this evil trend has quickly been imported into China and Japan. In places where women gather, homosexual incidents are often heard. For example, senior girls in girls' schools caress beautiful junior girls, female teachers pay special attention to lovely students, and one student passionately admires another student. These facts can be found in any school. In dormitories, female factories, and public toilets, old maids or widows are often employed as supervisors. Their most important task is to warn the supervised against interacting with the opposite sex. Under their terrifying gazes and high-pressure means, the supervised can only obey orders and abide by the rules; but when girls reach a certain age, their reproductive glands in their bodies are strong and naturally express a demand for love. At first, it is just a kind of friendship between the same sex, and gradually it will naturally tend to heterosexual love, but between them and the opposite sex, there is a long embankment, so they can only seek love from the same sex. When it reaches a passionate level, they must satisfy the desire for contact.</p>
<p>The result of homosexuality not only causes physical and mental illness, but also makes it impossible to live a normal married life between the opposite sexes. When homosexuality is obstructed, it will also lead to suicide, jealousy, or love suicide, just like heterosexual love is lost. Isn't the Tao Liu murder case, which caused a stir a few years ago, the most obvious example of jealousy? Although the case is very complicated, people generally say that it is the result of homosexual love.</p>
<p>Since homosexuality is a bad habit that harms women, public lectures or discussions should be held in places where women gather to make those who have not been infected with the bad habits understand its harm and prevent it before it happens. Those who are infected but are still at a mild level should be guided to the right path of heterosexual love. As for those who are already sick, they must seek medical attention as soon as possible. I hope those who are responsible for training and supervision will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Assorted Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Yao Fei</p>
<p>Recently, the Legislative Yuan amended the criminal law, and there are two wonderful theories about women that have actually caused a stir in the meeting: one is to regard the defilement of a woman under the age of sixteen as rape, reduce the age by two years, and change it to under the age of fourteen. The reason is according to the ancient saying: "Women have their menstrual cycle at the age of fourteen," and it is believed that once the menstrual cycle arrives, the woman is considered mature. Secondly, it is to prevent women from using their age to blackmail lewd men. It is not to say whether women are sexually mature at the age of fourteen, but even if they are really mature, maturity is not the same as complete development! The members of the Legislative Yuan never pay attention to the physical health of women, but in order to prevent lewd men from being blackmailed, they changed the age of sixteen to fourteen! This spirit of protecting the interests of men—(lewd men) is really good—the other is a certain member's great truth about punishing "women who seduce married men": He said, "Recently, there are often greedy people who marry their daughters to important people as concubines, and there are also greedy women who marry their daughters to important people as concubines. However, this kind of educated woman will never be a concubine, and she will definitely choose her wife to take over the magpie's nest," this member first forgot the premise that "it is the man who takes a concubine and plays with a young wife," so it seems to be justified when he speaks, but why should he take over the magpie's nest? It is also obviously impossible to justify himself! In our opinion, the responsibility for seduction and taking concubines should really be borne by men. For example, the "Gu Li case" that once caused a sensation: is it Li who is willing to be a concubine? Or is it Gu who tricked her into marriage? Men who use their position and money to seduce women have always been the same as Gu, but the members of the Legislative Yuan, in order to fulfill their task of protecting male rights, always distort and falsely accuse women.</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>The women's movement has long disappeared. Unexpectedly, women's groups have repeatedly appeared in Shanghai recently, and this phenomenon is very good. However, the biggest conclusion of the women's movement lies in the family and childcare. If this is not fundamentally resolved, no matter how enthusiastic the heart is and how sincere the intention is, everything will be in vain. In addition, a movement is of course for the majority, not for the minority, especially not for the individual. However, looking back on the past, what we have seen is only a minority in power and individual fame, and the masses are still the suffering masses! The current virtuous people are of course no match for the old fools of the past. Reminding is necessary, and also, Chinese male rights are so great that they are close to wild silkworms. The selfish psychology of men, even those who think about progress, cannot be avoided sometimes. Ordinary people who eat meat are even more unbearable to ask about. Therefore, those who preside over the women's movement must grasp the principle of absolute equality between men and women, and strive for the interests of women themselves (which is actually the interests of the entire human race). Do not fail to think deeply and clearly about things, and do not be emotional, and even do things that are equal to shackles and fetters for yourself—you must know that those who verbally support women's rights may actually be obstructers. This is something that must be paid close attention to. It seems that the Chinese women's movement is raising its head again, and I dare to make such straightforward remarks.</p>

<h3>Economic Independence is a Prerequisite for Sex</h3>
<p>— Hong Hua</p>
<p>Why is economic independence a prerequisite for "sex"?</p>
<p>Isn't it an incomprehensible mystery that women have been oppressed like slaves, treated as "non-human" in life and status, regarded as inferior to men, and have survived to this day under the control of men?</p>
<p>This necessitates that we look back and examine history.</p>
<p>In ancient times, when the production of necessities was only to meet the most basic needs, the abilities of men and women were essentially the same. At that time, they worked together equally and enjoyed the pleasures of life together. In battle, women fought as bravely as men; they could carry heavy loads and engage in strenuous labor like men, and they lived very happily; they were physically strong and very beautiful.</p>
<p>At that time, women, as human beings, lived healthy lives without exploitation or oppression, bravely fighting against nature.</p>
<p>However, changes in production methods and the distribution of products affected the relationship between the sexes—women became the first human beings to be enslaved, even before the existence of "slave" as a human category.</p>
<p>The progress of life through fishing, herding, farming, etc., gave rise to the need for specialized knowledge and the manufacture and use of tools. In this process of social development, production tools were mostly occupied by men, making them the masters of wealth. The system of "private property" established its firm foundation at this time, and simultaneously with the establishment of private property, women became the property of men.</p>
<p>The initial manifestation of private property was the oppression of women—wives were forbidden to associate with other men, while men had the right to keep concubines. Sons became the inheritors of private property, and daughters, from the moment they were born, lived and breathed in unequal treatment. The family was merely a prison of chastity for daughters, until they were sold into another iron chain—the bondage of their husband.</p>
<p>Oh, this sorrowful existence! Listen to how our poet expressed the status of women at that time:</p>
<p>"Of all beings with spirit and flesh,</p>
<p>Ah—the most pitiable existence is surely us women!</p>
<p>We must be sold to our husbands with a dowry—most hateful is that our bodies must belong to him.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of person he is, good or bad.</p>
<p>This danger is most alarming—because divorce is an insult to women, and women are not allowed to reject their husbands.</p>
<p>Women now follow the new law without regret, they must speculate on the nature of their husbands—because no one tells them.</p>
<p>If we could go far away and happily live with the one we love.</p>
<p>This is what we most admire.</p>
<p>But if not, it would be better to die!</p>
<p>Men can escape the troubles at home, and outside, they can find someone to comfort them.</p>
<p>Among friends, among peers—but we must live lonely at home!</p>
<p>They say that women are in no danger,</p>
<p>When they live at home during the season of war.</p>
<p>What foolish notions! I would rather go to the battlefield three times than go through childbirth once!"</p>
<p>This miserable, inhuman life of sexual servitude was experienced by all women. They existed for the narrow confines of the family, as machines for producing children, as managers of the household, and as servants of their husbands. On the cornerstone of this economic organization of private property, laws stipulated that a woman's life and freedom were collateral for offenses against her husband. Religion helped the rulers create the will of God, giving women extreme humiliation, attempting to extinguish their rebellious dissatisfaction with reality in the smoke of fatalism. Biased education instilled in women the virtues of gentleness and submissiveness as the highest virtues for women. These tools for oppressing women created their weak and stubborn characteristics, and the recognition of the meaning of their own lives, even today, after thousands of years, is still almost seen by most women as natural and right.</p>
<p>Why must women be subordinate to men? Can they not live without being subordinate to men? Is this subordination really natural and right? Of course, this is due to the ideas preserved by heredity, habit, and education, and is the result of the oppression of social relations! This result stems from the "economic dependence" of oppressed women on oppressor men.—This is what history clearly tells us, that women who lived happily as human beings were reduced to the miserable status of slaves entirely due to the system of private property, forming the "economic dependence" of women.</p>
<p>"Economic independence" is the prerequisite for "sex," isn't this an undeniable truth?</p>
<p>Because although the economic organization has transformed from feudalism to capitalism, and society has undergone drastic changes, the private nature of the property system remains the same, and is even more profound. It is inevitable that women still groan under subordinate oppression.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that women have not experienced any liberating changes in the process of social evolution, nor can we fail to recognize that the rise of capitalism has made a considerable contribution to humanity under the feudal system, especially to women. However, the shackles that the private property system has imposed on women will forever be the target of women's curses and resistance. This is "absolute" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Language and Thought</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>Tolstoy said in his "What is Art?": "Language can convey people's meanings and experiences, so it can be the law for human union, and so is art. The difference between this law of communication and language is that people can use language to convey their own 'meanings' to others, and use art to convey their own 'emotions' to others..." It is of course Tolstoy's mistake to contrast "meaning" with "emotion" and to indicate the difference between language and art accordingly; but it is correct to say that language is a tool for conveying people's thoughts, to a certain extent.</p>
<p>In the process of their social life, human beings form certain thoughts due to the constant stimulation of all things to their brains. But these thoughts are latent in their minds, and to express them, the tool of language is indispensable: language is the tool for expressing thoughts and conveying thoughts.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the mouth and hands cannot reflect objective things and form certain concepts, only the brain can reflect objective things and constitute human thoughts. If human beings did not have a special brain, there would be no thoughts, and therefore there would be no language to express and convey thoughts: there would never be language without thought.</p>
<p>Because language depends on thought, the development of language also develops with the development of thought. It is obvious that in feudal society, the content of human thought was so-called noble and lowly people, respect for gods and belief in ghosts, emphasis on agriculture and contempt for commerce, so-called authoritarianism, determinism, etc., so the language of human beings at that time could only express these, could not talk about scientific democracy, nor could talk about free competition and individualism, it can be said that there were not even such nouns in the language of human beings at that time: it must be in modern society, it must be in the development of society with capital, machinery, factories, trains, ships, airplanes, etc., that human beings will have thoughts about these, and thoughts such as so-called scientific democracy and so-called free competition and individualism will exist in the minds of human beings, and therefore there will be these nouns and phrases expressing all their relationships in human language. – This is an example of how the development of language develops with the development of thought.</p>
<p>However, language, whether it is a vocal or written tool, is an indispensable thing for human beings to use when thinking to indicate the individuality and specificity of the relationships of things. Without linguistic symbols, without specific nouns for determining things and phrases for expressing everything about them, humans cannot think and cannot form any form of thought. For example, although the concept of the Earth is a concept in thought, this concept is still represented by vocal or written symbols, and without these symbols, our thinking about it cannot proceed. Therefore, language plays a very important role in thought, and its importance to thought is just as important as thought to it—language. If we say that there is no language without thought, then we can also say that thought cannot be formed without linguistic symbols. Moreover, we can say that thought is latent language, and language is the expression of thought in vocal or written symbols. In this respect, they are interdependent.</p>
<p>Of course, we can also say that in the process of human labor life, thought occurs before language. Children who cannot speak, animals without language, have sprouts of thought in their brains, and their senses can also have certain feelings about external objects, and therefore can also have certain recognitions and imaginations about these external objects. But in any case, this is very childish, very simple, without abstraction and with a reasoning function, just a simple impression of the true color of external things. Lafargue said in his "Economic Determinism": "When a child says a doll, he cannot understand that he is saying any kind of doll, but only a certain kind of doll, that he has taken in his hand or that an adult has already shown him. If people show him another one, he will even push it away angrily." Why? Because the child has no abstract reasoning thought, he only has a simple true-color impression of external objects, so he thinks that a doll only refers to the doll that he sees and holds in his hand, and he cannot think of anything else. In addition, the thoughts of animals and even barbarians are not developed, and are not even one ten-thousandth of those of civilized adults, which is because the language of civilized people is developed. Because there must be developed linguistic symbols to carry out higher thinking, there must be perfect linguistic tools, human thoughts can be conveyed very conveniently, human knowledge can be well inherited, and therefore human thoughts can become richer and more developed day by day. Therefore, Lafargue also said: "In fact, the most abstract mind cannot think without words, without speaking to itself internally. Even if he uses words and speaks to himself, not like a child who is constantly noisy verbally, there are still many adults who mutter what they are thinking. Language occupies a very large position in the development of knowledge."</p>
<p>In short, language and thought are closely related, and they are interdependent: without thought, language cannot occur, and without linguistic tools, thinking cannot be carried out and thought cannot be formed; language develops with the development of thought, and the development of thought must also rely on the advancement of language as a tool; finally, they are actually two forms of the same thing: "Thinking is silent language" (Max Müller), and language is audible or shaped thought.</p>
<p>Various Industry Investigations</p>
<h3>Employment Agencies</h3>
<p>— Ren Zhong</p>
<p>In today's era of economic decline, rural bankruptcy, and the increasing severity of unemployment, employment agencies are indeed a beacon of hope for unemployed individuals without connections to the powerful. These agencies are most prevalent in the United States, and similar establishments have now emerged in Shanghai. However, due to the limited scope of their services, many professional workers do not receive adequate assistance. While such agencies are a significant product of the current social stage, they cannot provide vast avenues for the majority of unemployed individuals, which is somewhat regrettable.</p>
<p>Here, I will only discuss the content of "Foreign Employment Agencies." There are currently twenty-one of these agencies in Shanghai, mostly run by White Russians. Having resided in Shanghai for an extended period, they are quite familiar with the household situations of various foreign nationals, leading many employers to seek their services. White Russians engaging in this type of employment agency work often emphasize spirit over formality. Later, as the number of people seeking employees and those seeking employment gradually increased, it formed a unique product of the city.</p>
<p>These "Foreign Employment Agencies" are most numerous in the French Concession area, followed by Seymour Road and North Szechuan Road, where several are established. Each day, at least one hundred people visit each agency seeking employment.</p>
<p>The scope of services provided by these "Foreign Employment Agencies" is limited to foreign affairs, roughly divided into the following categories: 1. Compradors, 2. Head Cooks, 3. Shop Boys. These are the three categories for men. In addition, there are two categories for women: 1. Amahs, 2. Junior Amahs.</p>
<p>A comprador earns at most twenty-eight yuan, and their duties include managing the employer's food, clothing, and room cleaning. Sometimes, they also manage the employer's finances. However, to reach this stage, a comprador must have at least three to five years of experience. The duties of a Head Cook are equivalent to those of a Chinese chef. They are not expected to interfere with anything other than cooking, and the employer will not order them to perform tasks outside of their duties.</p>
<p>The wages of a Head Cook are similar to those of a comprador. However, they also receive a commission of five percent on the groceries they purchase, which is considered "extra income." This "extra income" has become an open secret, and even if the employer handles the purchasing themselves, the commission can still be obtained. "Grocery stores" absolutely adhere to this unwritten agreement. The wages of Shop Boys are significantly lower, at most not exceeding sixteen yuan per month. Their duties are extremely complex, leaving them with no free time throughout the day. This is a difficult job where "effort does not translate into money." The reason is that most Shop Boys do not speak much English, so they are relegated to lower-level tasks. Shop Boys work the longest hours among the three categories, starting at five in the morning to light the coal stove, wash floors, wipe glass, and clean rooms. In the evening, they must also polish the shoes of the male and female employers. All of these tasks are performed exclusively by Shop Boys. In addition to their monthly salary, Shop Boys do not receive any "extra income," which can be described as "skimming." For example, they may receive kickbacks on shoe polish, glass cleaner, and metal polish purchased for the employer.</p>
<p>Amahs perform tasks that men cannot, and they are often close to the female employer. For example, they take care of children, assist the female employer with bathing, wash clothes, and iron clothes, all of which are inconvenient for men to handle. Their wages are only twenty-five yuan, and may sometimes exceed the wages of a comprador, but this only occurs in certain special circumstances. Junior Amahs also do not speak English, and earn a maximum wage of twelve yuan. According to standard practice, Junior Amahs should earn fifteen yuan, but three yuan are usually taken by the Senior Amah. This is because Junior Amahs do not understand English, so they are forced to have three yuan deducted from their income. The duties of a Junior Amah are to wash clothes and sometimes iron clothes. If the Senior Amah is trusted by the employer, the Junior Amah must also perform many private tasks for the Senior Amah to ensure their job security.</p>
<p>Their work may not seem very burdensome, but they lack security. It is common to be dismissed after only one or two days of work for an employer. For this reason, although employment agencies are limited to "foreign affairs," they can still develop independently.</p>
<p>A person engaged in "foreign affairs" employment will not find it difficult to find a second job as long as they have not committed theft. When you register with an agency, they will ask you where you worked before, the name of your employer, and ask for a photo of yourself.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>This initial procedure is then completed. In addition, the collection of referral fees also has certain rules: for "deals" from twenty to thirty yuan, the fee is one yuan and twenty cents; for those over thirty yuan, the fee is two yuan and forty cents; the lowest, such as Junior Amahs, is only charged sixty cents. This is called a handling fee. Handling fees are always paid in advance, with no leniency for delays of even a day or two. The agency is not responsible for whether the "deal" is successful.</p>
<p>Employers who need people can simply leave a mailing address and specify the type of position they need. Sometimes, they don't come in person and just notify the agency by phone, and the agency will immediately introduce a person to you. Employers are charged a uniform fee of one yuan.</p>
<p>Employment agencies have the power to freely control the people they refer. Although their regulations stipulate an order of priority, some people who are experienced in running employment agencies have found ways to circumvent their regulations. This means that in addition to the prescribed referral fee, they also offer extra remuneration. If they find a "deal" with a higher wage, it will undoubtedly be given to those who are willing to pay extra.</p>

<h3>The Discovery of the Kneeling Crying Corps and the Future of Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yuan</p>
<p>In the newspapers not long ago, in addition to the many daily political, diplomatic, military, and rape and murder news that we are accustomed to seeing, we also saw the following two news items: one was the discovery of the Kneeling Crying Corps, and the other was the bombing of the Yuelai Southern Goods Store on Five Horse Road.</p>
<p>The details of the Kneeling Crying Corps' actions and the bombing of Yuelai have been reported in detail by various newspapers, so I don't need to repeat them here. What we cannot refrain from saying is that the fact that these two incidents occurred in Shanghai at the same time and place makes us unable to regard them as ordinary social news and ignore them. Although the discovery of these two facts cannot fully gain the sympathy of the general public, their value in containing national significance is always worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>The Kneeling Crying Corps had previously shown its face in the Tianjin area, but it was still a novel sight in Shanghai. However, facts like the bombing of Yuelai have already been seen many times. The former adopts a passive plea, while the latter tends towards violent sanctions. Although the methods are different, their ultimate goal is the same: to stop foreign goods and promote domestic goods.</p>
<p>However, what kind of reaction do these two incidents have on society and the promotion of domestic goods? This is something that we really need to observe calmly. The "Kneeling Crying Corps" was only recently discovered for the first time, so we are naturally not in a position to make any judgments about it. However, the bombing of Yuelai and similar historical facts have already occurred many times, but what effect have they had in the history of the domestic goods movement?</p>
<p>According to the latest import index published by the Customs, the amount spent solely on entertainment is a staggering figure of more than 10 million. This shows that all the past movements to resist foreign goods and promote domestic goods have been wasteful and have achieved nothing. Now, let's take a look at this staggering number:</p>
<p>"In September, the import of radio materials from Shanghai totaled 130,331 gold units: equivalent to 260,662 yuan in national currency, plus the import for the first eight months of the year, which was 517,040 gold units, equivalent to 3,034,092 yuan in national currency, totaling 3,294,753 yuan in national currency. In September, the import of rouge and perfume from Shanghai totaled 45,193 gold units, equivalent to 90,386 yuan in national currency, plus the total import for the first eight months of the year, which was 585,429 gold units, equivalent to 1,161,858 yuan in national currency, totaling 1,253,244 yuan. In September, the import of canines and live animals from Shanghai totaled 146,496 gold units for the first nine months of the year, equivalent to 292,992 yuan in national currency. In September, the import of automobiles from Shanghai totaled 478,065 gold units, equivalent to 956,130 yuan in national currency, plus the total import for the first eight months of the year, which was 5,822,779 gold units, equivalent to 11,645,558 yuan in national currency, totaling 12,600,1680 yuan. The total value of the above four items is 17,442,677 yuan in national currency."</p>
<p>After looking at the above four types of imported goods, apart from radios and automobiles, which are completely absent in our country, wouldn't it be that there are no such things as perfume and birds and beasts? However, discarding their own things and insisting on sending as much as 4,547,997 yuan into the pockets of the foreign masters before they feel satisfied, can this be said to be the result of the inadequate advocacy of people engaged in the domestic goods movement?</p>
<p>The answer we can get here is that the industry has no awareness of self-invigoration, the government has no policy to prevent the import surplus of foreign goods, and the people have no confidence in using domestic goods. Even if one hundred more Liang Tongfang come out to throw bombs, and countless "Kneeling Crying Corps" come out to plead, the import surplus figures published by the Customs will still gradually increase!</p>
<p>Career and Marriage Guidance</p>
<h3>On Choosing a Spouse</h3>
<p>— Ge Hu</p>
<p>Hakuson Kuriyagawa once said: "Love is the union of two different sexes, that is, a man and a woman, to complete each other and enrich each other's duet of two sexes." From this, we can clearly know that the ultimate goal of love cannot be separated from the purpose of "managing a life of two sexes." However, in the heat of passionate love, most young men and women are blindly infatuated with each other, and do not add any rational perspective. They only regard the "illusion of the heart" as the god of complete personality, only worship and only praise, and have no time to discover each other's shortcomings, let alone talk about choosing, which has really reached a very big crisis. We often see a pair of lovers who are already deeply in love, but why do they turn against each other when they have passed the stage of passionate love and reached the stage of marriage, and even feel endless pain? Moreover, it is often said that "marriage is the tomb of love," but why can't marriage increase emotions and walk into the tomb instead? All of these are because of the lack of consideration before love or marriage, from which we can know the importance of choosing a spouse.</p>
<p>In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Chen Heqin conducted a survey of 266 people at Southeast University on the "Conditions for an Ideal Wife" to study the motives of his psychology. The results were: (1) Regarding appearance, most advocated moderate appearance, (2) Regarding age, most advocated equal age, (3) Regarding learning, most advocated above secondary school level, (4) Regarding family background, most advocated not caring, (5) Regarding temperament, most advocated gentleness, (6) Regarding the wife's talents and knowledge, most advocated being able to manage the household.
