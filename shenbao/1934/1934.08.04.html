<p>有人焉。蓬首垢面。胼手胝足。食不厭麤。衣僅敝體。時時匍匐於驕陽烈日疾風暴雨之下。載重曳遠。而作牛馬走。人世艱辛。至斯已極。乃計其所得。且不足以事父母。畜妻子。此非一人力車夫之寫照乎。凡關懷於人道者。鑒於人力車夫處境之慘酷。蓋無有不惻然心動者。</p>
<p>然凡百制度。必有其淵源與背景者在。人力車制度見之於我國社會者。垂數十年。固非矯揉造作者可比也。此數十年中。西洋交通利器之輸入。若汽車·若摩托·若飛機·若輪船。先後接踵而至者。不可勝數。而人力車制度。依然得保持其常態。且其勢力方蔓延於内地城鎭者。何也。豈非以我國農村破産。民生凋敝。貧苦鄕農。無以覓升斗於吠畝。乃不惜麕集城鎭。仰車主之鼻息。得一車焉。以苟延其殘喘爲幸事。又豈非以東方人士之經濟力量較薄。時間觀念不厚。有一低廉之代步物若人力車者。用以任重致遠。慰情聊勝於無。故人力車制度之所以形成。由於人力之過剩者半。由於社會之需求者亦半。吾人固熱烈期望。凡在人力車通行之城鎭間。其負地方行政之責者。亟應對若許人間地獄中之可憐蟲。一援之手。但亦雅不欲置此制度之淵源與背景於不顧。不然則縱具滿腔熱忱。一片好心。愛之或正所以害之。生之或正所以死之。矯枉過正。分何取也。</p>
<p>本埠公共租界工部局當道。負有改良界内人力車夫生活之使命者也。其所遵守之主張與政策。吾人亦旣知其崖略矣。所不能不商榷者。該局對於界内人力車之將來。究抱何種之態度是也。吾人知一九二四年至一九二六年之工部局交通問題委員會。曾經建議將人力車之數目。逐漸减少。而得該局之贊成。（見一九三三丨三四年人力車委員會報告書第一一七頁）而最近人力車委員會亦復明白聲稱。「現時之社會。必須盼望前途能有須將人力車逐漸在上海街道上消除之時。」（見同上報告書第一三一頁）其所提出「工部局應於兩三年後將此事重加考慮」之擬議。（見同上報告書一三一口及一三二頁）且已爲工部局所採納。以此數點與人力車管理處之第一項職權相參照。（該項云。「管理處對於逐漸减少車照得隨時建議」見本年三月二十二日本報新聞欄）皆足令人感覺工部局對於界内之人力車。頗有逐漸减少以至於消滅之傾向。惟其時間。則殊未確定耳。</p>
<p>吾人須注意者。人力車委員會之建議。共有十六項之多。共前三項乃有　於一新公司之組織者。雖在目前尚未爲工部局所採納。但亦未嘗作廢。誠如委員會言。該公司如有成立之一日。則其經營之結果。當爲工部局考慮人力車數减少問題之根據也。</p>
<p>吾人殊不願爲人力車制度作辯護。而對於人力車委員會之主張。亦表示相當之同情。惟工部局政策之趨向。有關於十餘萬平民之生計。及全市交通之利便。故敢忠告該局當道。對此重大問題。必須深思熟慮。面面俱到。與其事後遺憾。不如事前謹愼。今觀於工部局之政策。一方在使「人力車得繼續存在。」（參觀七月三十一日本報新聞欄人力車管理處麥西氏談話）一方不免有逐漸减少以至於消滅人力車之傾向。則有似乎歧路徬徨。模棱兩可。將何以自圓共矛盾之使命。而不致貽「爲德不卒」之譏乎。尚願該局當道在此風潮嚴重聲中。對於整個的人力車制度之前途。作一澈底之思考。然後定其未來之方針也。</p>

<p>以馬來半島爲中心</p>
<p>全島將密佈飛機塲</p>
<p>星加坡特約通訊、記者於上次通訊「世界風雲緊急聲中南洋英荷屬地之防務」一文中、對於英荷兩國在其東亞殖民地備戰之積極、旣已報告於祖國同胞之前、今再引一事、以作此佐證、其事爲何、卽英國最近擬在全馬來亞半島、實施新的航空計劃是也、按該計劃之大概、卽自馬來半島之南端起、至北端止、每五十英里外建築一飛機塲、使全島密佈機塲、一旦有事、卽將飛機爲防守領士之重要工具、閱者在平日對於世界大勢、若稍有研究時、卽不難測知、英國勢力之所以能在遠東如此擴張者、乃全恃其殖民地之力也、英國在東亞之殖民地、其最著者爲香港·澳洲·馬來亞·及印度·若以日前英日對立狀况下言之、則香港離日本最近、倘英日一旦不幸發生戰事、香港必居最前綫、惟香港僅係一小島、食糧及一切、皆不能自給、勢難久守、是以英國對於香港之防務、雖極注意、但不可不謀一退步之地、澳洲地位、雖亦甚重要、但究有菲律賓·婆羅洲·新幾内亞·等羣島爲屏蔽、日本不易進窺、故現時在英國遠東殖民地佔最重要之地位者、乃無過於馬來亞、一因該地離英國之生命綫印度甚近、二因馬來亞之星加坡島、本爲歐亞交通之樞紐、且爲英國三Ｓ政策綫之要點、故馬來亞若有意外、則不但英國在印度之地位、將見動摇、卽英國在遠東之殖民地、亦恐有脫節之虞、是以英國政府之眼光、乃不得不集中於馬來亞、而視馬來亞爲英國遠東防務之中心也、</p>
<p>英國在馬來亞之佈防、非今日始、惟自九一八後更見其積極耳、如不惜耗數千萬磅之鉅欵、以建築星加坡之海子港、該港完成後、英國在遠東之海軍、已有極强之根據地、當可無憂、惟英國目前所尚提心吊胆者、在嚴防他國空軍之襲擊、而同時且擬利用空軍、以補助海陸軍兵力之不足、此所以最近乃有全馬航空新計劃之進行也、</p>
<p>世界民族性不同、凡喜誇大之民族、作事必先大吹大擂、易引起他人之疑忌、而英人則好守緘默、凡事未有相當成就以前、决不肯輕發一言、我人觀於英國遠東航空司令史米富氏之態度、卽可知矣、史氏到星已久、但從未作一次公開之談話、最近方對新聞記者宣佈此計劃、是可見英國對此新計劃、乃已有切實之把握而正在邁進中矣、</p>
<p>以事實言、馬來亞最近之航空事業、早已有相當之進展、譬如自荷蘭本國至其殖民地爪哇之飛機、必在星加坡停留、英帝國航空公司、更使倫敦至星加坡之航綫縮爲八日、星加坡至澳洲之長途飛行、又定於本年十二月十一日通航、英國航空部且已將南洋羣島之航空地圖、測繪成功、而星加坡·吉隆坡·及檳榔嶼·三地、已皆有航空俱樂部之設立、以供平民有志航空事業者之研究、况自亞羅士打以至星加坡、飛機塲之設備、已極週密、在全綫上有雙溪大年·檳城·太平·怡保·吉隆坡·實兆遠·巴生港口·雙溪尼保·峇株巴轄·及馬六甲等地之飛機塲、業已完成、或正在籌設中、故全馬來亞半島、每五十英里處、建築飛機塲一處、當非困難之事、我國人鑒於他人之積極準備航空、其有若何之感想乎、</p>

<p>顧聲一之談話</p>
<p>中央社云、邇來外界囂傳本市雜糧界有購進大批洋米、且傳日人裝運東三省方面大批雜糧與本市雜糧界成交、中央社記者、特以此事往詢雜糧業鉅子顧馨一氏、據談如次、</p>
<h3 id="c122">西貢米一批已到滬 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>據顧氏云、本市米業界確曾向暹羅米商訂購西貢米、業已到滬者、有一萬餘包、至於報載地方恊會有訂購西貢米四千餘噸之說、略有誤會、查該項西貢米并非以地方恊會名義所訂購、乃係本市銀行界及其他實業界諸先生、以私人名義所訂購、現尚未運到、俟運到後、亦不卽出售、尚待明春如發生米價狂漲時、再行平價出售、至於暹羅華僑米商何德孚、曾與本人會晤、現尚在滬、何氏此行、係回國調查米價、故本市米業并未與何氏有所交易、將來如國内米價繼續高漲、何氏允爲運西貢米回國、以資調節、</p>
<h3 id="c123">日方並無雜糧運滬 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>外傳日方近有大批雜糧運滬推銷一節、據顧氏答稱、此說殊屬無稽、東三省原以黃豆及紅梁爲主要出産品、但按目前市價、東三省所産之黃豆、其價每擔在四元以上、紅梁每擔將及三元、均較内地價格爲貴、按黃豆在安徽江蘇等省、均有出産、該省等運滬銷售之黃豆、價格爲三元四角、較東三省黃豆低一元之譜、故東三省之黃豆、已久未運滬推銷、且按諸内地所産各項雜糧、現在尚敷所用、故亦不需外來雜糧之接濟、雜糧商方面、亦决以國産者儘先推銷、故此說殊屬無稽云、</p>

<p>施行期已議定半年</p>
<p>川河航輪自四月一日七公司解散同盟後、各公司跌减水脚、爭運貨件、至今棉紗一項、已跌至二元一件、較原定運率、祇十分之一、其他各貨、亦一致减價、致航行川河之輪、無一不受虧折、川河航輪、現以民生公司之勢力最大、澮宜一路之華商輪船、十九併入民生、該公司爲謀發展長江下游之營業、及分運沿海各埠下水貨計、特由該公司總經理盧作孚親來上海、與招商局恊議江海聯運合作營業辦法、經長時間之討論、刻已决定全同十八條、由雙方當局簽立、卽日實施、亟將詳情、查報如下、</p>
<p>合作動機民生公司年來收買之船日多、在川河内已握得航輪之第一位、惟各船行駛重慶宜昌居多數、次爲渝滬直放船、在營業上、上游固占優勢、而於下游則缺少碼頭貨棧、致尚不能盡量發展、該公司爲此問題、曾與滬上各輪公司接洽多時、均未成功、會國營招商局自峨嵋輪失事後、上江航輪、頓感缺乏、而民生之總理盧作孚、乃向該局接洽揚子江航輪合作、並恊議與招商局各海輪聯運辦法、雙方會商多時始告成功、</p>
<p>訂立合同兩公司之江海聯運及揚子江會作營業、由雙方會議之下、訂立合同、共計辦法十八條、由劉鴻生·盧作孚·恊商結果而定者、經多次修改、至七月三十一日始擬定正式草案、招商局提交理事會通過、民生方面盧作孚在滬、卽可負責簽字、現尚在另訂兩公司合作聯運辦事細則、聯運從本月起、暫定六個月期滿後、如成績優美、得再延長、</p>
<p>聯合辦法合同内訂定自重慶起、至漢口止、復自岳州·長沙·以及長江下游至上海、再南北洋兩綫、合江海兩處、共總二十一個輪埠、爲聯運範圍所及地、民生公司在渝萬宜一段、供給招商局運輸貨棧等項、並規定民生不在湘鄂路長江路增添船隻、招商局不得在渝宜綫内增添班次、招商局南北洋輪代民生裝載聯運貨件、招商局轉船貨之入川者、亦交民生輪運輸、在渝萬宜運出之貨、歸民生簽提單、在上海方面之入川貨、由招商局簽發提單、</p>
<p>即日實行雙方將合同訂定後、便議實行、民生輪由川來滬之船、到上海已經改泊招商局北棧碼頭、貨客起卸、頗稱便利、招商局川河、雖現無船行、亦可承裝客貨、蓋得交民生船代運矣、民生公司本日出口之民族輪、已開始聯運萬縣重慶貨、招商局因川河合作成功、其久已停頓之招商渝報關行、刻有恒泰出爲承辦、</p>

<p>此項草案雖未認爲施行有效之正式法律、然對於該草案學理上之採用、及條例上之斟酌、亦不無多少之先例、凡我國研究法學及厠身法界者、無不深喻此旨、爾時之所以如此規定者、一則遵從我國固有之習慣、次則略仿德國法系之精神、以此例彼、可見合夥債務之按股分担、在立法上我國原有此種先例、足資證引、敝公會等上年之所以聯合陳請、原非無據、至此則不能不再行補充者、此其一也、（二）就立法之手續法論、商業登記云者、在北京政府時代、即屬於商業註册查北京政府之立法、原依前清法律館編纂之成例、將民商兩法、各自分立、故關於</p>

<p>審判機關之裁判時、亦無須再加以調查或舉證、在法律上所謂因登記而得以對抗善意之第三人也、即債權人）反之、凡屬合夥營業、而不依現行法律登記者、如遇合夥營業失敗、而合夥財産不足清償債務時、該合夥人、不論其出資之多寡、價格之如何、凡屬債權人、對於該合夥之任何出資之一人、不論其股本全額之如何、均負連帶清償之責任、此所謂因不登記、而不能對抗善意之第三人也、（即債權人）若以此而適用現行民法六八一條之規定、正可謂絶無絲毫疑義者也、</p>
<p>依上論斷則就實體法規論、對於合夥營業之連帶負責、與按股分擔、在我國立法上之沿革、不無考慮之除地、就乎續法規論、對於商業登記法、如照上述程序、而予以嚴格的制定、爲欲保障商業之安全、債權之鞏固、不論現在立法之主旨、保護債權制、與保護債務制、均有强制登記、並勵行契約法規之必要、甚至對於合夥營業之不請求登記者、科以</p>

<h3 id="c177">怎樣看電影（續） <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>中國電影無例外地是特殊社會層的支持者，因爲它的生産權，同樣操之於特殊社會層的手内。最初是，火燒紅蓮寺之類的影片出現，這些影片的作用，顯明地是借着傳奇小說的影響，來更廣大地施行麻醉，使大衆順從地回到封建社會所産生的武俠英雄的懷抱裏去，讓俠客們來替他們「除暴」，讓俠　客來「安民」，以消滅大衆自已求生存的抗爭。然而，這種作用，是最易揭穿的，處在水深火熱的大衆，永久不見有所謂俠客來拯救他們時，於是那些飛簷走壁的絶技，終只成爲他們腦海中的幻影了，因此，接着來的便是畸形的戀愛影片的生産。中國的戀愛影片，往往不同於歐美的戀愛影片。歐美的戀愛影片，是完全以肉的剌激華麗的佈影，來消除對生活的憒怒，但中國的戀愛影片，却不是這樣，其主要内容大都是描寫一個女人因爲受到物質的誘惑和男子的引誘，而陷入了戀愛，結果不是受到男子的虐待或遺棄，便是懸崖勒馬，終於覺悟過來完成了有情人終成眷屬的圓滿歸來。當然，這種影片的作用，是比武俠影片有效得多的。無疑地他曾使一部份落後份子有過官戚上的暫時滿足，而獲得他們的一聲讀嘆，不過，這也只是一聲讀嘆而已，只是暫時的滿是而已，於是這些聰明的先生們，又不能不再進一步從别一方面來遂行他們的巧計。最近的姊妹花，漁光曲，以及猺山艶史，王先生等，便是以各種不同的表現，達到他們最後目的的産物。猺山艶史和王先生之類的影片，前者是以一種冒險的離奇故事，後者則純是無聊滑稽的故事，這些影片，無論在内容和形式，實等於改頭換面的火燒紅連寺，在這裏，我們要特别提出的，是姊妹花和漁光曲。牠們是目前最能吸住觀衆的幾張影片，姊妹花中的大寶二寶，以同一出身的姊妹，一則因色相超羣，得將軍的垂青以至爬上了太太的地位，一則因外貌不揚，永遠陷在困苦的生活中，而至於成爲囚犯，這種對比，已經含有「萬般皆是命」的作用，何况作者在結局更幻想出一次非常偶然的會合，完成那「一人得道，雞犬升天一的大團圓。老實說姊妹花是和啼笑因緣不相上下的，</p>
<p>以上，是五光十色的中國電影界的全面目。如果要從這裏面去獲取一點滋養，是非常困難的。電影一方面固然是特殊社會層的擁護者，但另一方面却不能不有觀衆來支持，爲了企業關係，不能不投合市塲，于是，只有觀衆的力量，才能促成大衆影片的生産。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<p>我來自東（十四）</p>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>最可笑的，要算同船的三個菲列賓人了。一個是菲列賓大學的工科敎授，兩個是芝加哥大學的學生。那敎授的偏見非常深，以爲菲列賓的一切，都是全世界第一。他說他自已的女兒，比好萊塢任何女明星要美麗些。他又說他自已到美國去，每到一城，便有年輕的美國姑娘，羨慕他的樣子而追求他。芝加哥大學生中一位，便當面嘲笑他，脫他被野鷄看上而來吹牛，他們便互相吵架起來。十多天裏面，同艙同桌，而相互間不打招呼。工程學敎授爲奚落那學生，便特别邀請别一位芝加哥大學學生，在舟抵馬尼拉以後，寄居他的家裏。每次敎授和我們談話，提到了菲列賓的好處，那學生便向我們，說些開頑笑及苛刻的批評。敎授是又粗又黑的莽漢，見面大家呼他拳師，背地裏我們當他是土匪。那芝加哥大學的學生，是又瘦又黃的青年，大概在芝加哥的下流塲所，是浪漫過來的。他的樣子，活像上海的小流氓。</p>
<p>船上更遇到兩位香港姊妹，她們是從夏威夷上船的。姐姐有點海病，往往臥床不起，妹妹却不怕風浪。在暖風晴日的下午，船的最高層，清靜明爽，成爲我們談話和游戲的最佳處。我們往往打着乒乓，把吃飯的時間都忘掉了。姐妹兩個，對於中國文學，都有很好的基礎和很深的興趣，談到宋詞元曲，有時我們笑個不開交，有時又恍然若有所悟。姐姐會跳那腰肢妸娜的夏威夷舞，妹妹會唱夏威夷歌又會彈琴。船上閒着没有事做，享受着美麗的音樂和舞蹈，不覺在這太平洋中，彷彿出現了第二個自由而快樂的夏威夷。</p>
<p>在船快到上海的前夜，我們和平時一樣的靠在欄杆上，很有凉意的海風，吹得我們三個人的頭髮零亂。繁星嵌滿了黑夜的天空，她們在描寫着夏威夷的清夜美景。我覺得她們的話很有詩意，妹妹還很會畫中國畫，難怪她的描寫十分生動。可惜她們不會說普通話，而對話的又不會廣東話，倒用英語來代替。海波在夜深時是黑色的。汽船過去，後面拖着一條白色的雪浪。我們靜靜望着前面將完了的征途，大家感覺着無名的惆悵。</p>

<p>太平洋上的郵船，除日本船外，水手都是中國人，所謂中國人，是指廣東人，或廣東台山等幾縣的人而言。他們的佔有今日之優勢，不是因爲技巧或勢力，而因爲能接受最低的工資。據船上的中國水手說，他們每月每人拿二十五塊港洋，而因爲這點薪水，便將生命在太平洋的船裏冒險了。當然，在國内接受更低工資的，不知還有多少中國人，工作環境，比船上更劣更苦，受僱主待遇更其殘酷的，不知還有多少所在。但而我每每對着那些白短衫青長褲的中國船員，那在洋人們咽嗚叱咜的命令及態度下生活着的中國青年，有的眞有很健全、頭腦非常清楚的青年，我心中非常難受，我覺得他們不應該在這裏做工。</p>
<h3 id="c179">不同於吳稚暉先生的兩點意見 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>吳稚暉先生也來參加大衆語的討論，這是很可欣幸的一件事。吳先生好久不發表關於學術的問題的意見了，然而從這回的給曹聚仁先生的信中看來，可知他對於「大衆語」這個問題，實在從頭就注意着，所發表的意見，雖在好些處所留着朦朧，但的確是經過深思熟慮的，並非隨便的敷衍。因爲如此，這意見很值得注意，也很值得討論。</p>
<p>吳先生也贊成大衆語的建立，這將打破許多人的迷惘。雖然是極少的少數，但是現在確還有人對大衆語表示懷疑，或說：「大衆語究竟是什麽東西？」或說：「大衆語根本是錯誤的。」對於這些人，吳先生的有幾句話就够對付：「文言·白話·大衆語，有容易普遍與不容易普遍之分，當然白話比文言容易普遍，大衆語一定更比白話容易普遍」。更簡單地說：大衆語就是最普遍的一種語言，這就答覆了「大衆語究竟是什麽東西」一問。白話欠普遍，大衆語要做到更普遍，這還有什麽錯誤？不過，倘是頭腦有點毛病的人，也許對於「普遍」還要懷疑：「爲什麽定要普遍呢？一但到了這地步，我們可以不管了，讓他們懷疑到死罷！大衆語可是從此將被强力地要求了，由於牠的「普遍」，書店要求大衆語編書，因爲由此可以得到更多的讀者，影片公司要求大衆語作說明作對白，因爲由此可以得到更多的觀衆，一切宣傳和廣告機關，也要求大衆語供他們利用，……所有的學者的主張和提創，還不及實際的需要之有力，何况患腦病者的懷疑和反對。</p>
<p>假如大衆語是建立起來了，而且普遍地被大衆所使用了，但是用了這語言所編的書，所說明的電影，仍舊講的是窮人被老爺打了屁股，還要叩謝，一個小生和一個花旦在後花園「打克司」…亭些事情，那末大衆仍舊不要看，結果，書店老闆和電影公司老闆仍舊不能簾錢，那時「大衆語」纔兹仍舊要被否定了。</p>
<p>這就可以看出大衆語問題中的意識問題之重要。所謂意識問題，也就是吳稚暉先生所說的「衛道」問題。</p>
<p>然而，吳先生雖否認文體與衛道有關，而我却以爲有關。</p>
<p>舉例說罷，「刑不止大夫，禮不下庶人」，這兩句是衛道的文言，然而决不可翻成白話，並不可翻成大衆語。關鍵完全在乎「刑」和「禮」兩字的矇矓，或者可以說是漂亮。老百姓是愚蠢的，但也有個程度。當他們不懂人們所說的話的意義時，他們會愚蠢地信服，但一被他們懂得，那就要開始懷疑，甚而至於「性起」的。因此，古人立敎條，字面總是立求含糊，籠統，抽象，玄妙，使人不懂，這纔能够使人信服，此之所謂「愚民」。文言文就合「愚民」之用，故「愚民」之道，只有文言文能衛，衛來纔没有破綻。用白話文固然也可以做「禮不下庶人論」，但必至說得太露骨終究是不妙的。倘是向百姓宣傳一種道理，一種主義，目的是在使他們懂呢，譬如三民主義，那就非用白話不可了。文言固然也可以寫三民主義，但决不能像白話三民主義似的風行。要一種主義被普遍地理解和接受，一定要利用普遍的文體。由此可知文體與衛道，實在大有關係，這一點吳先生似乎未嘗想到。</p>
<p>對於吳先生的「文學不死，大禍不止」論，我也有點不同的意見。吳先生的本意原是很好，他主張用科學工藝救濟大衆，但是他以爲文學和别的智識，是「害於爾國，兇於爾家」的，所以主張拉倒，這用意完全是國家爲大衆。然而，吳先生把事情想得太簡單了，他說「若大衆語文合一了，寫點粗淺的科學工藝文出來，」就能「惠及大衆的飯碗」。科學工藝本身因有救國家救大衆的可能，但在現在的情形之下，是不能的，只看美國好了，語文是合一的，科學工藝是發達的，然而羅斯福總統所努力的是經濟復興，可知它的國民經濟是衰弊了的，它的退伍兵和工人常要閙暴動和罷工，可知它的大衆並不是都有好飯盌的。這些情形，科學工藝不能救，難道完全是受了文學的害麽？這總說不大通。</p>
<p>吳先生的意思，以爲文學完全是智識分子弄出來的把戲，大衆現在是不需要的，所以他說：「等衖堂裏的癟三又需要有衖堂消遣品，再讓他們來創出大衆文學」。這也是不對的。衖堂裏的癟三，田　裏的村夫，他們向來一切都有，也有文學，也有哲學，也有他們的工藝科學，根本是因爲他們有這些一切的需要。然而他們現在所有的一切，從質一方面說，是低級的，從量一方面說，是貧乏的，而且倷伲的大衆與阿拉的大衆，彼此各異，不相溝通融合，因而也不會變化進步。大衆語的建立，正是要借普遍的語文之力，溝通融合一切倷怩和阿拉的大衆的意識，使之豐富，使之變化，使之進步，將普遍的高級的文學哲學…等等，去代替原來的局部的低級的一切。這裏面重要的還是大衆的意識的凈化。大衆的心理與智識分子的心理是一樣的，他們决不是除了「飯碗」以外就無他種需要，文學也是他們所需要的，大衆語建立了之後，當然要有大衆語文學，（而且，在事實上，大衆語的建立，先得經過大衆語文學的嘗試。）吳先生把「大禍」的責任推在「文學」身上，已是不公，根本否定文學，尤共說不通。贊成大衆語而否定大衆語文學，便成了買檀還珠了。</p>
<p>自從建立大衆語的問題成立以來，我就完全贊同，但我所研究的是建立大衆語和大衆語文學的技術問題，預備在一方面寫一篇文章。現在看到吳先生的論文，覺得上述兩點有辨明之必要，所以先寫了這一篇</p>

<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>工人們成年累月是只曉得忠實的替老板工作着的。一種急切的想當暴發户的野心，有時使他們在支得了「月活錢」後，不管家裏的人是在挨餓着，也會勇敢的走到賭塲上去孤注一擲！但若不幸失敗了，他是一點也不會懊悔的（想到勞苦得的代價，白白的給别人去了。）仍舊辛苦的那末去工作着。整天的疲勞，以及對於生活的哀怨，到了下工後的晚上，便藉着種種不同的動作和表示，放蕩的發洩出來了。</p>
<p>每天晚上，我是怎樣的爲老張的那動人的月琴聲感動着呀，在喧囂的伙房裏，在慘淡的煤氣燈光下，我懶懶的躺在老張身旁打地舖的一床發霉的草蓆上，老張靠着牆，悠然目得的彈起他那破舊的月琴來，一種是幽怨，是熱情，是泣訴，是憤怒，是反抗的清音，震盪在煩燥苦悶的空氣裏，一切呌囂和粗暴的聲音會死一般的寂靜下去了。</p>
<p>他初彈總是要彈一些情意纒綿的戀歌，和熱情奔放的愛曲，什麽「河邊腔」（五）哪，「海菜腔」（六）哪。……慢慢的他又彈到「三步行」（七）的伴奏曲，一種有節奏，有旋律的聲音，剌激到每個人的耳裏，人們便會拍起手掌來有節拍的和着他，或者竟衝動得不知不覺的跳起「行」（八）來了。</p>
<p>這樣熱閙的彈了一陣以後，他俟人們微微的感覺到有點疲倦時，才輕輕的彈到那凄厲逼人的：</p>

<h3 id="c181">答吳稚暉先生（節錄） <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>稚暉先生：近日編理「文白論戰史話」，把民國十三四年間的「覺悟」「學燈」「語絲」「國語」「現代評論」重新看過一遍，不覺苦笑；老狗敎不會新把戲眞如劉半農先生須說的：「唯有中國人纔會這麽没有出息，永遠在不成問題的問題上無謂的打圈。」汪懋祖先生在「新青年」上和陳獨秀胡適糾纒不清；在「後甲寅」上像煞有介事地和章士釗唱雙簧；此番又復興呀復興呀這麽大起勁。（中略）其事雖愚，其心當然可哀！</p>
<p>（上略）先生先前推詳章士釗的心理，說他那種鳥柳文，要給執政看得起，呌官僚驚嘆；那種「陳咸之子敎子以諂」之「執政考」等，無非艶慕俳優文人的結果；其妻子若不羞而相泣於中庭，吾不信人間眞有其事也…………先生這一回於汪柳兩先生，獨多恕詞，謂其「救人之意七分，衛道之意亦有三分。」又謂：「汪柳諸先生是胸無成見，是殉人的，並非護已的。」私意有點不敢苟同。汪先生的文言復興論在「時代公論」發表以後，接着就有「文言復興之自然性與必然性」的應聲，「甲寅」雜誌那一套世道人心的老符咒都吟起來了，「大公報」的南京通訊，就說文言復興是怎樣變成新的潮流。……這種種蛛絲馬跡，告訴我們：汪先生的主張文言復興……小世兄之出路猶在其次，趁天下荒荒之世，抓個題目過過寫標語貼標語的癯，不待弗羅乙德來分析，也能如見其肺肝然的。（中略）我覺得這一回文言復興的氣分，和民國十四年的「老虎」氣分太相像了，我們不能加以原諒！</p>
<p>大衆語問題，應該「卑之無甚高論」，由大衆自已來動手，原是「天經地義」不容懷疑的。目前的事，却是要我們先來說服所有筆桿子的朋友，放鬆一點文字權，使大家有手可動。胡適之先生在美國時候，他要說服梅光迪，任鴻雋……那些朋友，使他們相信活文學要用白話來做，費了很大的勁。有一時，梅光迪也曾說過「文學革命自當從民問文學入手，此無待言，惟非經一番大戰爭大可」的話，後來回國，又在「學衡」替文言做保鏢了。筆桿子朋友，無論如何總覺得文字是可寶貴的，要想獨占牠，不肯公之大衆。明知道注音字母，羅馬字母，簡筆字，都是有利於大衆的工具，偏偏擱在一邊，旣不肯學，又不肯敎；我去年說了一句「寫别字也不要緊」，還挨了許多臭駡呢。我們至少要有傳敎牧師的精神，一而再，再而三，不怕麻煩地幹下去。我想：國語研究會舊同人决不能放鬆這個責任，一革命尚未成功，同志仍須努力。」我這回發下痴願，寫了許多信，請在北平的胡適，周作人，錢玄同，黎錦熙，傳斯年，店鉞……諸先生和上海的魯迅，矛盾，孫伏園，陸衣言諸先生大家表示一點意見。譬如寫金剛經，能不能成佛，且由他去，寫總得一張一張地寫下去的。先生於國語運動，開國元老，「功垂宇宙」，還有許多實際的事，請先生再發表一些意見！</p>

<h3 id="c202">ＡＢＣ三類放大器淺釋 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>眞空管在無綫電機中，放大爲其主要任務之一，近幾年來，無綫電學術猛進，雖同以眞空管作放大器，其工作情形，亦可使之不同，故有ＡＢＣ三類的區别，均各有其特殊的優點，眞空管除少數專爲某類放大而特殊設計者外，其餘通用眞空管均可任意使之成爲某類放大器，祇須將栅極負電位與輸入的信號電壓，校配得宜，使適合某種條件，此三類放大器的原理及其優劣比較，兹分别扼要述之</p>
<p>一、Ａ類放大器眞空管用作Ａ類放大器時，其屏極輸出的電波形式與栅極所受輸入信號的波形式，完全相同，故不失眞，此點最爲可貴，參閱圖Ａ，示某眞空管的屏流丨栅壓特性曲綫，如作Ａ類放大器，必須利用其ab兩點間的直綫部份，使栅電位配至約在此直綫部份的中點，如虚綫所示，當栅極受信號電壓激勵時，正半週之最高點，不可超越零電位而使栅極受正荷，負半週的最高點，不可使屏流减至過小而達下部的膝點b，否則仍難免失眞，細察圖Ａ，可知Ａ類放大器，無論輸入電壓的强弱，如何變化，其屏電流恒不變，卽無信號電壓輸入時，眞空管亦常消耗最大的電力，故效率不佳，實爲Ａ類放大器的大缺點。</p>
<p>二·Ｂ類放大器爲改進Ａ類放大器效力不佳的弱點，於是有Ｂ類放大器産生，其所異者，卽配合較高的栅負電位，使無訊號電壓輸入時，眞空管屏電流爲零，故並不消耗電力，及至訊號電壓輸入，當正半週時，眞空管産生屏流，依訊號電壓的高低而升降，在負半週時，屏流完全截止，所以僅能將輸入電壓的半週放大，其餘半週，已爲之割去，情形如圖Ｂ，如以此Ｂ類放大器，作成音週率放大，勢必完全失眞，但亦有補救之法，通常Ｂ類放大器，常以兩個同式的眞空管，作推挽法的連接，使每一眞空管分别担任半週放大的任務，而後併合之，如此輸出的電壓狀態，仍能與輸入者一致，參閱圖Ｄ，自能明瞭，Ｂ類放大器效率雖佳，但機件繁多，構造複雜，除非對於眞空管的特性，有確實的認識，往往不易爲功。</p>
<p>三·Ｃ類放大器Ｃ類放大器栅極的負電位，須較Ｂ類者更高，通常約爲使屏流完全截止的兩倍，激勵栅極的電壓，亦需極高，其正半週的最高點，須足以能使眞空管的屏電流達飽和而有餘，參閱圖Ｃ，可知其輸出的電壓狀態，完全失眞，故Ｃ類放大器絶對不能作爲成音週率放大，如用之作爲廣播機的高週率放大器，則極相宜，因輸出的高週率電壓，祇須求其包覆綫不失輸入時的原來狀態，每個電壓的如何失眞，實際上並無影響，Ｃ類放大器尚有一特點，卽其輸出的電力，恒與其屏極輸入的電力成比例。</p>
<h3 id="c203">中間週率變壓器自製法 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 頴夫</p>
<p>超外差式綫路的收音機中，那中間週率變壓器，總算是重要部份之一罷。這種東西，現下在市面上很難找得到，就是有，價錢總是很貴。一般爲經濟所限的業餘家，就没法來嘗試，那祗有對着外差式的收音機在興嘆了，然而這種變壓器，也大可自製的。</p>
<p>尚若那綫路中，是有一個高週率變壓器（就是普通稱做初級和次級的兩個綫圈，因爲牠們合併在一起時，經電磁或電容的誘導交連，就能够把那初級的高週電流，引進那次級綫圈去，這種作用，和變壓器一樣，所以就稱做高週率變壓器，凡外差式的綫路，都採用這種配合。）和兩個中間週率變壓器的，那麽可買八百圈的蜂房式綫圈（小型的）四個，和四百圈同式的兩個。倘若是須要三個中間週率變壓器的，那就要多加八百圈的，和四百圈的各一個。這些小型綫圈的直徑是有限制的，所用的綫也是很細的，市上總可以找到。</p>
<p>先把八百圈的兩個，來裝做高週率變壓器，然後再用兩個（八百圈的，和四百圈的各一個），來做中間週率變壓器，那四百圈的做初級，那八百圈的做次級。</p>
<p>不論圈數的多少，那些綫圈的内直徑，總是相同的，那麽可找一根膠木軸，像圖中一樣的串起來。倘若怕牠們移動，則可用小塊的硬紙版墊實，或是用膠水來黏緊。在木軸的一頭鑽一洞、預備用螺釘將牠們固定在膠木底版下。</p>
<p>高週率變壓器兩個綫圈，應該互相距離一公分，至於中間週率變壓器呢，那兩綫圈的距離，就可减至半公分。那初級的應在次級綫圈的下面，和圖中所繪的一樣。</p>
<p>當那些綫圈固定了在膠木版下面之後，才在板上，就正正的在那次級綫圈的上面，安置一個○○○五兆分法的電容器，牠的兩極，就和次級綫圈的綫頭，分别銲接起來。</p>
<p>至於那初級綫圈呢，一頭可直接的接到那和牠相關的眞空管的屏極，另一端就接到高壓（四十五，九十，或一百二十五）的正極去。</p>
<p>不要忘記，在超外差的綫路中，那高週率變壓器的初級綫圈裏，是附帶着一個間於○○○二五，至○○○五非分法的電容器的，但是在哈脫萊式外差綫路中，這電容器是不需要的。</p>
<p>這些變壓器間的距離，最少要有十二公分，（由一中心軸到别一軸）；倘若那些中間週率變壓器相接的太近，便會發生感應，那麽揚聲器裏就發出可壓的呌聲了。</p>
<h3 id="c204">用電燈泡爲耗阻器 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>普通電燈泡可利用爲耗阻器。其優點爲能經較大之電流及價格低廉，其缺點爲佔地過大及裝置不便。但此外尚有一大缺點，卽其耗阻數值並不一定，其經過電流之大小大有高下是也。設若地位及耗阻數值無甚關係時，則以電燈泡之價廉而易得，實可用爲甚佳之耗阻器。今將普通電燈泡之電流及耗阻，詳細列表於下，以供參考。</p>
<p>表中Ｖ爲弗打，Ｗ爲瓦特·Ｃ·h·爲支光：電流用安培爲單位，耗阻用歐姆爲單位；第五行「燈絲冷時之耗阻」爲大約相近之數，並不準確。若燈泡爲二百二十弗打，則其電流數值，照表中同瓦特數之一百十五弗打者，大約减半；其耗阻數值則加倍。若一電燈泡之瓦特及弗打數爲已知，則其在規定電壓下時之電流可以算出。以弗打數使除瓦特數，則得電流數。以電流數除電壓數，則得耗阻數。</p>

<p>— 江之蕃</p>
<p>近年無綫電廣播事業，異常發達：一般人士，多購置收音機，以作娱樂之用。江浙一帶，又幾皆有交流電源，故交流收音機因其使用便利，經常費用較爲節省之優點，日見普遍。而市售之交流收音機，皆爲舶來品所龍斷。此類收音機至少四燈，多至十二燈，無不裝璜美觀，選擇性及靈敏度甚佳，音量洪亮悅耳。然而近數月來各廠家競爭市塲，激烈萬分，互相减低價格，以求多量脫售。但價廉物美，實難雙全。何况大批製造之時，不免偷工减料，較騐亦未能精確。草率從事之結果，收音機效力旣不佳，復每易損壤。一般人士，貪一時之便宜，往往損失不貲：要亦未知此類收音機之内容，與夫選購之訣要。兹以經騐所得，於經濟而效率高之立塲上，敢爲讀者縷述之。</p>
<p>（一）收音之目的　選購收音機之前，應於收音之目的，先作一度考慮。所購之機係專收本埠或近距離之播音，或須作遠程收音之用。以供個人或家庭之娱樂，或須應用於廣大會塲之中。按一般多以燈數爲選擇方法之標準，然而燈數多，未必能收音遥遠，發音宏量，須視廠家設計之優劣，及構造精良與否而定。同時，吾人尚須知今日中國之播音情形，除上海爲多數中小電力之廣播電臺混雜外，又除南京中央黨部廣播大電臺之外，星佈全國各地之廣播電臺，寥寥無幾，電力最大者亦僅一千瓦特，而距離恒出千里以外。今若備一機能收全國播音，其代價恐非中産之家所能擔任。况非特别情形，遠地各電臺之節目，似亦不能引起以娱樂爲目的之興趣。故從經濟上着想，家庭或個人娱樂之收音機，僅須以美滿接收本地或最近距離之大電臺爲目的。若上海播音情形，必求其分離清楚。合乎此種條件之收音機，似以超等外差式綫路之五燈機爲適宜。（市上四管機，大都不佳），至於内地距離大電臺較遠之收音，可用七燈機。至於其他收音條件所適用之機器，讀者當可推斷之。</p>
<p>（二）電源之核對　此爲選購舶來品交流收音機時，最應注意之一點。查舶來品中以美國貨居多。故其設計時亦爲美國標準，電源變壓器之進綫爲一百一十弗打，六十週波者。至於我國各地多爲二百二十弗打，五十週交流電源（本市法租界爲一百一十弗打，五十週）。選購時，務須注意所用電源爲若干弗打，若干週。而與所購機件，加以較核，務須完全相同方可。又查美國收音機内之電源變壓器，每有拆下硬改爲二百二十弗打者。因週率不同，對於設計上自亦不同。而此種硬改而成之電源變壓器，每易發熱。過熱則壞。一般人士，僅問電壓是否吻合，而忽於週率之較核，須知設計良好之變壓器，决不致發生過份熱量，購機者，與其每使用一小時，休息若干分鐘，犧牲若干優美節目，而結果不免常常損壞，孰若選購之時，多多愼重，出稍高之代價，而得一經久耐用之收音機耶？（待續）</p>

<p>往往因爲經濟的限制，足以消沉我們研究無綫電的興味。尤其在我專門仰給於舶來品的中國，雖極簡單的材料，亦不得不出錢購買。但是我們如若能够細心地的考察，無綫電的材料，隨處都有。下述乃介紹製造小規模收音機時，儘可利用的廢物材料。</p>
<p>（一）鋼精鍋子　鋁製，質軟易受人制。永不銹蝕。且導電率Ｃonduotvity接近於銅。此類廢鍋鍾平之可製電容器，金屬隔離罩，電液整流器ElectrolyteRectifier的鋁極。</p>
<p>（二）照相機軟片殼及牙膏瓶　質更軟，適用於製作固定容電器或活動容電器的定片。</p>
<p>（三）香烟錫紙　最易找得。質軟而易裂，祇適作大容量的固定容電器。取其薄也。</p>
<p>（四）牙膏及顔料的瓶蓋　用以作礦石杯，及臨時螺絲帽（先鑽不孔，然後旋上陽螺絲）之用。</p>
<p>（五）熱水瓶　瓶殼上部的金屬杯及金屬罩普通爲鋁或鎳鍍銅製。前者之性質用途如（一）。後者則光亮而富强性，導電率佳而不銹，可作固定礦石或栅漏的支持架。彈簧片接綫柱。分綫釘或活動電阻的旋轉鑰。燈座彈簧。眞空管帽夾。及接綫歸片等等。</p>
<p>（六）紙烟罐薄鐵封膜　表面塗鋅，有彈性。適代聽筒上的薄鐵膜，</p>
<p>（七）變壓器，聽筒喇叭之細銅絲，改繞在洋綫木軸上，可作爲低週率阻流圈Ｆrequencychokecoil。</p>
<p>（八）電熱器上的洋銀綫ＧermansilverWire可作小歐姆的可變電阻ＶariableresistanceEbonite。</p>
<p>（九）廢圓乾電池　負極上連導綫，埋入泥中或投之井底，可代地綫。其拆下之正極螺絲釘，可作接綫柱。</p>
<p>（十）唱片　爲硬橡皮Ｅbonite壓成者。可代收音機之面板口及其他之絶緣板（如綫管等類。鑽孔時，可以火燙之刀剪司之，彎曲則在開水中行之）。</p>

<h3 id="c207">最便利的指度盤 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>舊式的指度盤，（Ｄial）大概一共分有百格，使用時毫無意義可言，祗給你一個指示而已。新式收音機的指度盤，外面刻有啓羅週率數字，使用時除掉能給你一個指示外，還能使你知道電台的週率數，這當然是便利得多了。</p>
<p>事實上，我們接收無綫電播音時，所急於要知道的，並不是電台的週率數或是波長，而是電台的所在地和名稱。在以前廣播電台不多時，我們看了指度盤上的數字，還可勉强記起各電台的名稱。現在各處播音台林立，如欲逐一强記，實在不勝其煩。</p>
<p>爲增進使用人的便利起見，便有指示電台名稱度盤的設計。如圖Ｐ爲糊在指度盤反面的一張黑色厚紙，Ｌ爲劃在膠板上的白粉綫。每收到一家電台的播音後，便將牠的名稱用白粉寫在黑紙上。（最好再劃一短綫，使與Ｌ相合。）使用時，祗要注意白粉綫Ｌ所指示的地位，便能知道收到電台的名稱。如圖，當度盤指在三十五度時，即係上海李樹德堂廣播電台。</p>
<h3 id="c208">聽筒的調整 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 訓</p>
<p>我的一隻聽筒，因底螺絲未曾旋緊，而其音量反爲增大。蓋庫隆氏律（Ｃoulomb’slaw）指磁力反比於距離之平方，即螺絲鬆後，磁石與鐵膜距離减少，而其間吸力反大若干倍。亦即音量之大也。諸位若嫌自已聽筒發音低弱，可在磁石底部，塡一相當厚薄之橡皮。不論新舊皆可一試之。</p>
<p>他若你的聽筒，音量旣弱，又患失眞。則上法不能生效。蓋膜片被磁石緊，已達極度，其振幅爲磁石所阻擋而受制。且因磨擦而發生不悅耳又低弱的聲音。其調整法，可沿聽筒内壁，緊靠一厚紙圈，其高可隨意伸縮，以求膜片與磁石相離而至最適當距離。音色音量均可臻於上乘也。</p>
<p>（作者亦以第二法修好一聽筒其結果殊可驚人）</p>

<p>我不知道，這是爲的甚麽緣故，在無綫電材料的商店裏，經我很詳細的考察以後，知道所有的貨物，差不多大半是仇貨·</p>
<p>的確，事實告訴了我們，仇貨的價錢是比國貨和别國貨來得賤，賤得許多，甚至祇售到十分之三四的價錢·</p>
<p>無疑地，研究無綫電的，對于備置零件是極重要的事，那末，誰不想找尋低廉的價錢而减少各個的負担呢？自然！大家早已被仇貨的低廉的價格所引誘！</p>
<p>然而，我們對于將來獲得的成績是怎樣呢？十有九是失望了的，優良美滿的結果很少能使我們發現·</p>
<p>並且，我們爲研究無綫電而忘却了九一八和一二八的國恥不成？不！决不·</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>熱浪侵襲了一整天，傍晚的時候，纔覺得凉爽些；便撥了一隻藤椅，坐在樹蔭下看孩子們在羣地上玩耍，不禁回憶起自已兒時的情景來：</p>
<p>自已的兒時，却和現今的小孩子一般；不過社會的情形，是和現今的大大不同。所有隣居的姊妹們，不是在家中讀讀「女孝經」和「閨門訓」；便是在高樓中繡花做針線。伊們一到傍晚，也到塲地上來納凉，講着神怪式的故事；唱着流行的民間歌曲。我們男孩子也想軋上去凑凑熱閙，别瞧伊們年都在十齡左右，男女之防倒是很嚴，總要把我們攆出來；有幾個嘴尖的姑娘，還唱着這樣的一個歌曲來驅逐我們。「男軋男淘；女軋女淘。蘿蔔不軋菜淘；烏龜不軋强盜。」我們聽了這歌曲，祇得含恨地走開。</p>
<p>終究氣不過伊們，想一個法子來報復。於是在一個月黑星稀的晚上，乘伊們故事講得有味的時候，由我們男孩子中最頑皮的一個，穿着他爹爹的黑長袍，面塗黑墨，一跳一蹤，嘴内許許的作響，向着伊們衝去。眞靈騐呀！伊們嚇得皆逃回家去，有的喊着救命；有的號啕大哭。我們得了一個滿意的報復，没一個不拍手呌快；並相約不許露出消息，免得家中人譴責。</p>
<p>女孩子們眞不經嚇，明天一探聽，這些姑娘們都病倒了，有的家中忙着請醫生；有的延巫作法，都說塲上出了鬼怪，要攝孩子魂魄。從此塲地上每晚靜悄悄不見伊們的踪跡；便是我們做男孩子的，亦給父母關在家中，不放出去。</p>
<h3 id="c212">西瓜的故事 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>天氣很熱！經不起再說「熱話」。幸而西瓜還能帶些凉爽來，而它本身還有一則故事，大可寫出來給大家風凉風凉。</p>
<p>這是身歷紅羊刦亂的先大父在二十年前夏夜納凉的時候和我說的，稱它，「故事」，眞是再確切没有了。</p>
<p>這故事，内容很簡單，且又過去了這麽多年，但仍能激起我二十年後内心上的感喟，至少，我是受過它的影響的！</p>
<p>某甲和某乙「亂前」略有鄰居之誼，因爲貧富懸殊，甲常欺負乙，種下很深的惡感。但臨到離亂，竟成了一對不忍相離的難伴。他們也像一般逃難的同樣地肩挑背負着一部份捨不得招棄的家産，度着流離生活。所不同的，甲腰纒着許多元寶，乙却很累贅地拖着幾個西瓜！</p>
<p>時當夏令，天氣很熱。河浜井泉統給死屍壅塞，無水可喝！甲雖擁有元寶，没有機會換到水喝。不知是爲了顧全自已的需求，或是報復以前的怨仇，乙老是很珍惜地並且防衛很嚴地獨自在吃着西瓜解渴。他當然很明瞭甲在「無涎可滴」地望着西瓜發呆，但無論後者怎樣訴說，甚至捧出元寶哀求掉換西瓜，他似乎意志很堅定的絲毫没有表示！</p>
<p>當乙吃到最後的一個西瓜，甲委實口渴難熬，竟用火併手段去攫奪那隻西瓜，但他吃了乙的虧，因爲甲是嬌養慣了的！</p>
<p>他們就此拆夥。臨走，乙很慷慨的扔給甲一塊沾滿着尿糞的瓜皮，這在甲眞是甘霖，異寶，絶不躊躇地把它約略揩抹，隨即吞到口裏去了！</p>
<p>元寶也有不值錢的時候！西瓜是眞可寶貴的了！</p>
<h3 id="c213">江北嗬蘭水 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>今年的夏季，熱到百餘度，就是八十多歲的老前輩，也說從未見過；現在：雖降過幾次陣雨，而河道依然没有回復從前的水位；故在内地，居家的飲料，仍舊污穢不堪，這雖關於全縣的水利問題，不容易一時解决，其實公共衛生，地方上向不加以注意，我且把一件極小的東西來講，試問那一個肯去研究呢丨這東西，什麽名詞，我無以名之、姑名之爲「江北嗬囒水。」</p>
<p>這種「江北嗬囒水，」吾想不獨吾們嘉定地方有的，因爲江北人的蹤跡，到處可去，那末：做這種小販的，當然是各地都有了：！不看見街頭巷口，男的挑一副擔，架一個圓盤，上置一根能自轉動的横槓，用手一撥，看他轉到什麽一條綫上，就可得到那一樣；以前是用糖製的玩藝兒來引人入彀，眼前他也很會投機，利用胡盧形的小玻璃瓶，長不過約三寸多，聽說：起先用冷水灌進，再加了糖精少計，然後和以各種的色素，故看他表面，十分悅目，這副擔子的周圍，至少要有十多個兒童圍繞着；就是江北的老婦和年紀較小的，也手中提着這盤，拿這種紅紅綠綠的水來做目標，你！去想，兒童喝到肚子裏，是不是合着衛生，還是有礙衛生，所以我把他寫出來，供人家去研究研究！</p>
<p>有一天，一位朋友的兒子，年紀祗得八九歲，究說：在這江北人的盤上喝了一瓶嗬囒水，到了晚上，那肚子就疼痛起來，喊了一夜，還没有平復，是否這個原因，不敢斷定，什此天氣亢旱，一個月多，河乾水淺，飲料方面，已覺得非常危險：像這種嗬囒水，儻做兒童家長的，也漫不謹愼，哦！我恐怕病從口入，就在一個小小的玻璃瓶啊。</p>

<p>我常常不得不抹一點紛丨說抹一點粉也有社會環境的關係，似乎是笑話；但事實如此；我想跑進社會去，就常常不得不抹一點粉，這也許就是一般現代都會女性的苦悶。但是話可别岔開了。就說爲了要抹一點粉，而知道炎夏已經來了吧：</p>
<p>要抹一點粉而抹不上去，或者抹不好，這就爲是夏天了，汗已從面部汗毛眼裏排洩了岀來。這也是女性所感到麻煩的，到了夏天要抹粉這件小事情。</p>
<p>可是我現在也並不想多說些關於夏天抹粉的話，要說的是我的消夏方法。</p>
<p>我的消夏方法實在是極簡單的：</p>
<p>袋裏有得閒錢多，上冷飲店去喝一兩盃刨冰，喝一兩客冰淇淋。</p>
<p>時間太多的時候，吃過午餐就到融光大戲院去坐到黃昏出來；融光的入座劵是三毛大洋，院内有冷氣，可以連看，也可以瞌睡，買了一次門票，可以坐到你想着出去的時候出去，或者到深夜十一點鐘出來。到影戲院去消夏，這大概是我發明的方法了。</p>
<p>假若趁一葉小舟游黃浦江，我知道也是很好的消夏法，但我怕船翻人落水，所以常常跑到碼頭上立一兩小時；立在碼上吃江風納凉，也是消夏的好方法？</p>
<p>眞没有辦法的時候，那就閒步小天井中，或者彈上多少時候鋼琴：我是音樂的好愛者，奏一支凄凉的樂曲，在我倒眞可以消却多少熱汗的。</p>
<p>我的消夏並不高明，夏天在我，終究是苦悶的季節。</p>

<p>烏雲緊追在背後，剛跨進芽亭，雨就壓下啦，滾粗的點了，像千萬支箭打半空射下來，激成烟霧，冒開去，無數小圈兒，擠浮在池塘水面。阿珊抱着皮狗兒縮在亭角，怪乖的，小眼珠瞪着每枝雨箭。「嘩嘩嘩嘩……」勇壯的雨聲。青蛙兒蹲在大荷葉上，没聲没響地，敎給雨淋着，淋着。</p>
<p>一陣鳳，吹亂了瑛的髮絲，一陣風，吹落了我的草帽：「多討厭的風呵！」然而，我們喜歡有這麽一塲風雨。天空，一堆烏雲被一堆白雲堆了開去，雨停啦。白雲散了的時　，青色塡補了空，第一支陽光射到青蛙兒脊背上，樂着似的丨「咯咯咯　」呌着。樹田精神煥發，格外有勁，剛在它們怎樣挨着暴風雨的襲擊，而現在又怎樣受到陽光的洗禮，得着一個新的生命。</p>
<p>全園是綠油油的一遍，紅的地方是雨激開了月季花。一切是蘇醒了！</p>

<p>「可是我也怕那暴風雨的一刹！」</p>

<p>— 南宫生</p>
<p>在此炎炎三伏，驕陽迫人，熱度到了一百餘度的時候，誰都要找一個避暑勝地，來消磨這酷暑的天氣，莫干山廬山，雖是氣候隂凉，只是因了高處山巓，一切物質的享受，比較下不甚便當，便遠不如青島去避暑，來得便利而適宜了。</p>
<p>青島是一個沿省海濱的半島，三面環海，一面陸地，一年四季，都有海風的吹煦，把氣候調和，所以到了夏季，便成了個絶妙的避暑勝地。</p>
<p>自從青島租借與德國經營之後，經了歐戰的變遷，從日本手中收還到我國政治之下，這二十年經歷之中，一切的建設，漸漸的完備起來、尤其因了青島，是一個避暑區域，對於消夏的設備，益發的完善，有匯泉海水浴塲，有沿海的匯泉飯店和青島大飯店的旅社，有第一至第五的公園，有廣闊的沙灘，有跳舞的青島咖啡館，同了一切的一切，都足以使避暑的人，消受到無上的安適和凉快。</p>
<p>到了夏季，青島沿海濱的幾個旅社，都擠滿了來避暑的旅客，到了晚間，散步於海濱沙灘之上，受那海風的吹拂，這是何等樣快樂凉爽的境地。匯泉海水浴塲，在國内的海水浴塲之中，可算得首屈一指的了，有可以容納數千個浴者的海水浴塲，有廣有數里的沙灘，有十分完全的設備，到了夏季，夕陽西下的時候，可以瞧見千百個的海水浴者，在海水内受着洗禮，男的，女的，老的，少的，俏的，醜的，歐美人，日本人，印度人，中國人，可說是開了個國際人種展覽，都穿着美麗和潔白的浴衣，盪漾在海水之内，坐臥於沙灘之上，好似人間已没有了夏季。</p>
<p>第一公園的廣大，可說是出於人的意料之外，足有千餘畝的園址，包含着山嶺和平原，園内有合抱的古樹，千百株的櫻花，整齊的短柏，曲折的山徑，平坦的沙道，在這睡季，常見有許多汽車，在園中穿行，盤着山路上去，受着樹蔭的遮蓋，眞不知有什麽熱度過了一百度的夏季。所以，在青島避暑的人們，都不由你不樂而忘返了啊。</p>
<p>青島夏季的熱度，在日中時候，最高不過八十度，晚間却在六七十度之間，没有如莫干山廬山山上的低温度，也没有北平漢口般的高熱度，恰巧是一個避暑適宜的地點。只是你瞧見了寥城路的日本商店，巍巍轟轟的日本忠魂碑，受日本人敬禮的日本神社，便可以想到野心家對於青島的野心了。避暑的人們，可不要只知道青島是個避暑的勝地，而忘了青島的危險，怕若干年後，便不容你到青島來避暑，變成了東北四省的第二咧。</p>

<h3 id="c242">關於曹先生提出「大衆語的幾個小問題」說幾句話 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>昨天曹聚仁先生，在自由談上對於大衆語提出幾個小問題，請國語研究會舊同人，及關心語文問題的先生們，討論一下，我看了這封信，不免又要嘵舌起來。</p>
<p>我先要聲明的，我並不是一個國語研究會的同人，也不是關心語文問題的一個。我是被人駡爲有封建思想的一人，但是我到底是大衆的一份子，即以大衆的資格，來說幾句話。</p>
<p>關於大衆語的文字，增刋上也登載過不少，但多是空口說白話，一些得不得對於大衆語的切實辦法，所以後來也不看見編輯先生登載此種文字了。現在看見曹先生提出關於大衆語的幾個小問題，不免見獵心喜，來作馮婦。</p>
<p>曹先生的一封書中，我所最聽得進的，就是「關於大衆語的問題，儘是鑼鼓閙台，不見袍笏登塲」。這兩句話。的確旣經主張大衆，請幾位主張大衆語的作家，先做幾篇大衆語的標準文字，使大家來拜讀拜讀，若專靠腦筋中的理想，用村婦駡街的態度，是不中用的。結果只有借此出出風頭，就算殺了勝會，達了目的。此外對於大衆有什麽貢獻呢？有什麽實在的利益呢？</p>
<p>現在我並不對於曹先生所提出的五個小問題，加以討論，我對於曹先生所提出五個小　　之外，先提出一個更小的問題，便是最近高呾的大衆語，我根　　上　　入　里　中　　不清楚　現在大家主張的，究是大衆　？還是大衆文　　　　　　　　　　而文　在其中呢　　提倡大　文而語亦在其中？</p>
<p>所以我先提出的問題，便是大衆語和大衆文，應該合併討論呢？還是應該分别討論？</p>
<p>若講到大衆文而論，我先有一個意見，所謂大衆文者，天然必須從社會下層階級着想，纔能說是大衆，欃能使下層階級的大衆們講得出，聽得懂，寫得出，但是可憐的我國大衆們，大抵都是文盲，都是目不識丁的朋友。我國的識字份子祇有百份之十幾，而不識字者，到有百份之八十而强；（這裏恕我没有正確的統計，不過聽見别人說如此），而所謂百份之十幾者，便是大衆中最少數的智識份子。若照這樣情形而談大衆文，結果仍舊被幾位智識份子，弄弄筆頭，掉掉槍花而已，而所謂大衆者，依舊是欺人之談。是以欲使用大衆文，而根本問題，先在普及敎育。倘敎育不普及，無論你任何主張，而所謂大衆也者，仍舊如劉老老初進大觀園，同樣地莫名其妙。</p>
<p>若講到大衆語，天然自有幾位研究國語的專家，談起來自然頭頭是道，格外道地，用不着我門外漢來多嘴。但是以我封建式的頭腦想來，採取大衆語的方法，也决不能東採一句，西採一句，可以成功。也一定要指定一地方的方言，作爲標準，假定以北平的方言爲標準而論，因爲平話是最普通一些，苟能盡力提倡，設法推行，無論其官話藍青到若何程度，久而久之，自會得到能說，能聽，能寫的結果。若說因爲大衆語，便向大衆堆裏去尋，眞是築室道謀，三年不成，决不會尋出什麽道理來。</p>
<p>以上是大衆語和大衆文分别討論的說法，若說大衆語旣以能寫，能講，能聽爲條件，則能語必定能寫，能寫必定能聽，似不必分開討論，但是文和語到底有些不同的地方，一種是用口用耳的，一種是用手用目的，照現在的情形而論，還是有分别討論的必要，故我的意見是：</p>
<p>第一，須要普及敎育，先使大衆們　得斗方字數百個一成　千個，方有入手　法。</p>
<p>第二，先指定一地方言爲標準，方易着手，方言决不能從下層社會去找尋出來的。</p>
<p>這是作者的意見，未識讀者以爲何如？</p>

<p>— 村因</p>
<p>報紙上，登載着一段新聞</p>
<p>……王根林，十四歲。爲偷竊卡車上所裝載之煤屑，不愼，被車輪輾斃。</p>
<p>在小橋邊的茅屋一帶，提起了根林這小像伙，誰都會知道的。而且誰都會告訴你一個故事；帶着哀傷性的。</p>
<p>丨丨爸爸在他八歲一年，給關進監牢去了。爲了不能償還佃主的債丨</p>
<p>丨丨媽媽死了二年，整整的的。</p>
<p>丨丨他這小孩子哪丨孤單單的丨只有一個年老的祖母丨耳聾的，眼花的，每天都靠着牠底孫子活命。</p>
<p>這個活躍的根林，他倒有一顆孝順祖母的心丨</p>
<p>短短的，短短的六個年頭丨根本是不注意到的。</p>
<p>他靠着自已的一雙手，每天到工廠裏去掙幾個錢來。這末的生活着，他决不會咀咒到命運丨根林底心中想着：</p>
<p>丨丨我是多麽地順利啊丨祖田也没有一些兒不滿足。</p>
<p>他常常呆望着天際出神。有時，竟會想到了爹娘而流下涙來。然而，一忽兒他底悲哀又隨着空間的風兒吹散啦丨</p>
<p>小小的根林，他有着一個敏捷的腦袋。</p>
<p>工廠裏的人們，對於他都是很愛護的。有些工人們會把他們自已的大餅，分一半給他。</p>
<p>自然囉，他會常常想起分大餅給他的人。自已的工作做兒了的時候，他也很喜歡帮着别人幹完工作。有些人都說着：</p>
<p>「他是多麽地親熱呵，這小像伙丨」</p>
<p>苦哪！工廠裏的汽笛不鳴了二個多月。兩扇大鐵門緊閉着。門上還掛上一塊寫着黑字的白牌子。</p>
<p>根林從别人那兒聽來，知道工廠是歇閉了。他急着。急着……</p>
<p>丨丨没有辦法哪丨祖田是要養活她的。我自已也得活命哩！</p>
<p>於是，他在大餅店裏偷了三個餅。這是第一趟呢！</p>
<p>丨丨下一次我不喜歡這樣。唉！我底心兒跳得多利害呵！</p>
<p>明兒，肚子又餓啦！怪不爭氣的肚子！</p>
<p>「根林，你得去找一點别的工作！……」</p>
<p>祖母實在也挨餓了好久啦。</p>
<p>「祖母，我去找一點東西來吃吧！……」</p>
<p>慢吞吞的在街上走着。一雙没有光的眼睛，不住的在打轉着街上的每一個舖子。</p>
<p>猛的，他瞧見那邊有一圍人堆。好奇的，他也趕去瞧啦！</p>
<p>丨丨偷東西！</p>
<p>「他偷了我們的東西！不止這一次了！」</p>
<p>麵粉店的夥計，拿着木棍，對圍着的人說。那山東口音是多麽地可怕！</p>
<p>「打！警戒他！」</p>
<p>「偷東西的賊！打死他。」</p>
<p>「打哪！重重地打他一番！」</p>
<p>瞧熱閙的人，都混嘶着。</p>
<p>根林擠進人堆裏去。偷偷地伸出頭去看一看那個賊子是怎樣的。</p>
<p>丨丨呀！那個曾分過大餅給他吃的人哪。</p>
<p>他看見那個抱着頭着慌的，走開了這人堆。哦，他還有妻子，兒子哩！</p>
<p>丨丨祝禱他，打不痛！</p>
<p>根林只在這個心願了。對於偷東西的　賞，他更寒　了！</p>
<p>脆弱的一顆心兒　！</p>
<p>根林，萎糜的在路上躑躙着。</p>
<p>偶然，他發現了一輛卡車上裝的許多煤屑。好機會哪！</p>
<p>打車輪上爬上去。恨命的，把煤屑向袋裏面塞。</p>
<p>不留意的，車子開動了。</p>
<p>慌張的跳下來。可憐的小生命！給車輪輾過了！慘的！肚腸！……血……</p>
<p>丨丨小偷兒！不走正路的小偷兒！</p>
<p>路上的人，又喧嚷了！</p>
<p>家裏面的老祖母，還等着一個飽腹的時辰丨</p>
<h3 id="c244">揮扇急草 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>

<p>「戀愛」這名詞只有高貴的人們可以享受，另外一個階級便呌「軋姘頭」了丨</p>
<p>女人譯作「狗兒」確然不通，因爲同樣的是人，她是狗，男人該是雄狗了，所以，還是譯作「鈎兒」爲妥，因爲她們如果不是「鈎兒」，何以會秋波一轉，惱人三千呢！</p>
<p>國文敎員說：「國文爲中國本國之文字，所以，無論如何，寗願放棄别樣功課而不得不注意國文」，英文敎員說：「英文爲目前世界最通行之一種語言，將來與「職業」「位置」大有關係，所以，學生不得不注意英文爲要」，體育敎員說：「體育爲一切之根本，如果没有了健康的體格，便有天大的學識又有何用」？敎員對敎員如此鬥爭，都無非想把自已所授的功課弄好些，可以博得校長先生的說一聲好，然而却苦了一班學生了，呌他們如何適從呢丨結末，還不是一個「樣樣均不行」而已丨</p>
<p>在新大陸玩了兩個月，回來居然也做「印象記」了，有時甚至把店名誤成路名的都有，然而一書出後，居然也掛上ＸＸ銜頭了丨豈非笑話？</p>

<p>— 中朔</p>
<p>王小麻子牽着興發大步前走，怪怕人的，右手握着鬼頭刀，左手緊抓着背剪興發兩手的蔴繩，滿臉殺氣，像解犯人上斷頭台似的。可是天究未黑，步武之間不免帶有慌張的神情。</p>
<p>「Ｘ你奶奶，再不快些兒走？就賞你一刀丨」小麻子的右手一揚，鬼頭刀亮了一亮，接着賞了興發兩「火腿」。</p>
<p>興發掛着兩行眼涙，同後望了一下，一眼瞥見小麻子狰獰的面孔，迂緩的脚步跟着加快了速率。</p>
<p>「他媽的，紅槍會講的甚麽理？」興發心裏咒駡着：「二」月半前借他二十塊錢，到現在竟向我連本利要六十五塊，三月不到利錢要四十五塊錢？「孤老利」也没有這些丨這樣看來，老四說的小麻子想我的老婆這句話到不錯了丨」</p>
<p>憤怒的火雖然燃了起來，但是敢怒而不敢言，黧黑的臉上，祇起了幾條皺紋。這沮喪，使得脚步又迂幾了下來，於是背脊上挨了刀背的幾敲，迂緩的脚步意識地又加快了速率。</p>
<p>這樣的高踢聲中，西北角的五彩雲霓漸漸地消逝了下來。忽然王小麻子猛孤丁站住了，向後望，不見什麽，只有犬吠聲顫抖着隨風絲絲的傳來，小麻子没有慌張，依然逼着興發朝前走。</p>
<p>又一刻，急促的步代漸走近了，待回頭時，三個不同的聲音不約而同的交織着說：</p>
<p>「是王大哥嗎！」</p>
<p>「正是，没人追吧！」</p>
<p>「誰個敢？哈哈……」又是交織的聲音。</p>
<p>「原來湯鬍子也來啦！」小麻子說。</p>
<p>「我」在麽公公門口，看見老四同成德哥跑來，我所以跟來帮忙的。」湯鬍子接着回答。</p>
<p>「不要談心了！」成德同老四的紅纓槍一舉，首先向前大踏步走去。</p>
<p>天黑没久，他們都走入了村子。進了屋，興發就被綑做一團，老四拿着鞭子一面鞭韃一面考問。</p>
<p>「今年田裏的稻都乾死了，你們丨</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>丨猛想到這稱呼不恭敬丨丨幾位老爺當然知道，欠的二十塊錢我拚着不吃飯也要籌出的，至於利錢一層，……」</p>
<p>小麻子這時躺在藤椅上揮着芭蕉扇，大聲喝道：</p>
<p>「老四！不要同他多嚕囌，乾脆些，問他能不能還這六十五塊錢！」</p>
<p>呻吟聲中，老四的鞭子又高高地揚了起來。</p>
<p>「我看也榨不出多少汕水來！」不識趣的湯鬍子冷冷的說。</p>
<p>小麻子的臉立刻沉了下來，成德把湯鬍子一帶，帶到僻靜的地方，說明了小麻子看中了興發的老婆，湯鬍子這才恍然。</p>
<p>「大哥問你能不能還利錢？否則把你的老婆作抵押也行！儘哭，又不是死了爺！」老四的鞭子隨着話聲將要落下去。</p>
<p>興發想起了他的老婆，鼻子一酸，豆子般的兩行眼涙只往下滾。</p>
<p>院子裏兄弟們的槍刀聲要解颼颼地格外清脆，月光下黑影的縱跳像是蠻人的跳舞，屋外的人喘聲和着屋内的呻吟聲在空氣中蕩漾，顯得分外的嚴肅。</p>

<p>— 海波</p>
<p>一　阿貴的職業</p>
<p>轟雷似的車聲，衝破都市的沉寂。多早呀！天空還是魚肚色的，阿貴就推着長方形的糞車往每條街，每條弄，每家商店，住家出發，把别人排洩下來的東西一桶桶的朝自已的車裏倒。敲過了這家的門又去敲那家……</p>
<p>隆隆隆…………</p>
<p>鐵輪盤吻着石子路的聲音。</p>
<p>鼕鼕鼕…………</p>
<p>拳頭擊在門上的聲音。</p>
<p>這生活在他已有好多年的歷史，問幾個年老的娘姨，誰都知道的是這麽一張扁扁的臉，滿下巴鬍鬚的那個。</p>
<p>人家都不當他人看待，就是自已也忘了是人。他的嗅覺就像狗丨丨當然不是蹲在小姐太太身邊的哈叭狗丨丨是見了黃橙橙一堆拉開嘴就吃的那種狗。他嗅不出排洩下來的東西是臭的，他全靠這東西換飯吃。</p>
<p>飯吃下了拉出來的是糞，是誰都知道的。糞倒了去換飯吃的，人家總疑心是狗吧！誰知道呢？在天堂的都市裏，就有許多狗似的人在地獄裏生活着丨</p>
<p>扁扁的一張臉，滿下巴鬍鬚的阿貴，是許多狗人中的一個。</p>
<p>二　阿貴的病</p>
<p>一天天一月月一年年積下來的烏氣，像要爆發似的，阿貴的肚裏老是咕嚕着。屁股格外和馬桶親熱起來。</p>
<p>一定是昨夜躺在街頭上受了凉，一上午就是這末的拉了十幾次。肚腸像打了結，拉起了老是這末一點。肛門熱辣辣的草紙抹着就痛，四肢怪不得勁的發軟。</p>
<p>痢疾丨他會意到自已的病象。可是他没有錢，他没資格看醫生丨丨雖是醫生家的馬桶也是他倒的。</p>
<p>第二天，阿貴還是撑着病很早的推着糞車出去。他到過醫生家的後門，可是他知道醫生白净的手指是不屑按在自已骯髒的手腕上的。</p>
<p>毫不猶豫地再推着滯重的車身。滯重的步伐，去敲另一家的門。</p>
<p>回到草椪裏，再也支不持了。一仰身倒在地舖上。可是肚子又作怪了，重新起來蹲到馬桶上。</p>
<p>提着褲腰又倒在舖上，頭重重的像套了隻馬桶一欄。兩手緊壓在肚子，脚像風箱般的抽動着，抽動着。</p>
<p>太陽探病似的從窗口投進來，吻着齷齪的臉，齷齪的衣裳。</p>

<h3 id="c248">談鑽營技倆 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 蔚南</p>
<p>人的腦子是上帝擺佈好了，預備給你去想法子的，就是怎樣笨的一個人，他都會在腦子裏想想，所以，在上帝創造着人的時候，他就交付了人一樣技倆丨丨「想」。</p>
<p>「想」這種東西，在人們的腦袋子裏，牠的的確確的給了我們不論在任何一種東西或事體上面，眞是予了我們以很多的改善與改進，所以人就是因爲有了這個「想」，才有這樣進步的今日；因爲他會不斷地的去「想」，所以「想」在今日就成一種戰鬥的技倆。然人人都會「想」，但「想」之當中有賢與劣的分别，重要的關鍵，就在這裏。</p>
<p>現在差不多是專爲用「想」的時代了，誰個會「想」而且「想」的出奇，誰就得操勝利的左劵。可是現在是一個經濟恐怖，百業凋敝，萬事都不亨通的時代；在都市裏面金融的奇緊，祇有畸形的發展，像失業者的加多，正當事業的不興起，奢侈品充滿了商店，資産階級只圖自已的享樂，和片刻的陶醉，於是一些所謂迎合時代潮流的東西，就應運而生，若電影院，跳舞塲，咖啡店，風氣雲涌的擠滿了馬路傍邊的樓屋。在一個這樣尖銳化的時代，形成廣大的勞動羣，被擯到街頭巷尾，度着流浪而失業的悲慘。於是一批會「想」的，比人家「想」的快而又「想」的合人家的口味的鑽營的人們，就到處的賣弄技倆，如像拍馬屁，捧塲，當走狗，…………總而言之，在他崇拜的人面前，像女人一樣，賣弄風騷！</p>
<p>如不遂的時候，換言之，卽未鑽進去，於是百計千方的「想」，甚至削尖了頭盡量的去鑽去營。且鑽營的技倆有圓滑與不圓滑的兩方面，所謂圓滑的方面，就是風馬牛三種手段俱到，於是當你開始鑽的時候，要像泥鰍淤泥一樣，而看不見洞，以杜絶其後來者依道鑽營。所謂不圓滑的方面，就是被拍的人覺得你太重，被吹的人又覺得你太響，失去這兩種技倆，當然談不止「風」了。如果要想鑽營成功奏效，就得要實行風馬牛主義。</p>

<p>屋子裏從敞開的窗口，竄進來濃重的煤烟，惡吳異常，鄭太太的紅眼睛立時被飛來的煤烟迷目了，急忙抬手揉，這，孫太太看得清楚，握到勝利似地大聲呌着：</p>
<p>「好，好，誰讓你尖舌快挖苦人，天怪到你！該！該！」</p>
<p>劉太太邁動着兩隻小脚，趕忙走到窗前關上窗子。邢太太白嫩的臉皮上，掛了幾抹黑烟灰，她没有覺察到，但是，她却卽景生情似地說；</p>
<p>「眞討厭，天天要吃些煤烟！」</p>
<p>正對她們的窗口外面不遠地方，有一家小工廠，碗口粗的烟囱，整天整夜嘳着惡臭渾黑的烟灰，一遇到順風天，就一陣一陣刮進屋子裏來。</p>
<p>鄭太太已經揉好了眼睛，還不忘好的嘻笑慢吞吞地接着說；</p>
<p>「過幾天，就算你想吃都吃不到了。」</p>
<p>她這話，遭到邢太太的抗辯；</p>
<p>「那麽你的眼睛還没有迷够麽！」</p>
<p>誰也没有注意，煤烟在屋中打了幾轉就消散了。</p>
<p>屋外，全隱没在黑暗中。近處十三層高的外國公寓，窗口上露出顔色不一的燈光，人影在窗口愰動，不時飄漾着男女合啜的歌聲。無綫電收音機，也在同里内别的屋中播送着上海小調。</p>
<p>她們的屋子呢？一切都是比不上的，是凄凉的，是悲苦的，同時還有悶滯，氣憤的成分在着。</p>
<p>愈因此，才容易引起他們的憎惡；爲什麽别人有幸運享樂，她們只是過着苦苦的難挨的日子，而現在，彷彿又已走到了生活的末路丨如果不抗日，不是她們還可以在吉林居住生活麽？那麽。是作錯了事情？……</p>
<p>她們又胡亂談些閒話，但都是屬於令人不快一類的，有的人眼眶中悄悄地流着眼涙。</p>
<p>「孫太太，你再唱一段好不好？」</p>
<p>每次感到心緒不寗無可奈何時，就須要孫太太來解圍；因爲她可以唱幾齣小調的。劉太太看見别人眼眶中的傷心熱涙，就這麽提議，她爲的想要解除短時間人們内心的傷痛。</p>

<h3 id="c250">再論方言土語電影（下） <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>答唐納先生</p>
<p>大家都承認，五四時代的白話運動，是做了統一的工作的，但是自從一部份叛變了，一部份投降了封建勢力之後，而另一部份的前衛者却還是没有放棄他的任務。關於這一點，因爲白話的統一運動，對於我們頗爲有利，所以一部份是隨着他們自身之利益而叛變了，甚至於回到文言文，以求開倒車的復古，而一方面我們却要從文化方面加强社會改革的速度，所以語言的統一，决不是所當忽視的工作。至於敎化大衆的電影丨戲劇，爲了增加它藝術的效能，我們不妨採取一部份的土語，或者是某一劇本在某地臨時以某地的方言土語上演，這祇是我們的一種手段，决不是和大衆語的原則矛盾的。更進一步說，我們將大衆所需要的影片，製成某一地方的方言拷貝，然而這决不是和製片商人的「生意眼」同樣解釋的。那末唐納先生所極力主張的粤語聲片之製作，事實上是助長了這生意眼的傾向。而且假使以廣州話攝製，不見得就爲汕頭人所理解。至於它同時失却應有的全國性，自不待言了。而且照他的說法，使方言土語充分的發展下去，是否將農村回復到原始時代呢？這是我們的要問的，原來方言土語乃是很原始的東西。因爲他所說的「爲統一的分裂」，我們在前已經解釋過了：現在我們要加强領導作用，使其趨於統一，而不是使其分裂。</p>
<p>他說：「現在漢族的語言以至於社會經濟，本來就是分裂的…………民族的統一，不是從方言電影丨戲劇丨文學的提倡才開始分裂的。」又說：「語言統一的過程，决不像丹楓先生所說的那末單純。」前者，誰分裂中國民族？前面已有解釋，而後者的文化運動無用論，那簡直是要不得的。不錯，我們承認語言的統一，一定是由於經濟的，政治的作爲主要的動力，而文化運動始終也是主要動力之一。試問我們現在是否在幹着文化運動？就使經濟基礎整個的改革之後，是否還需健全的文化運動？文化運動在中國現階段之下，客觀環境不容許我們去肅清文盲，這是事實，但是我們得向着這條路上走去的。電影是敎化工作的利器，爲什麽不應當擔負起統一語言之任務呢？而我們現在所建設的大衆語，便是要將其統一全漢族的大衆的語言。文化無用論，固然是絶對的錯誤，而說文化不能促進語言之統一，也是一種怯懦的曲解。我們自五四以至現在，就没有放棄過統一的工作，而現在誰能在促進語言文化的統一，誰便是取得了領導的勝利。</p>
<p>照他所說的發展下去，因爲他要很快的使大衆能讀能寫，能說，將會提出除出方塊字，用拉丁字記音，或者是實用世界語。將來語言文化的發展，是否有這前途，我們還不敢預言，可是在現階段中，我們如將成爲和大衆生活習慣相融洽而且成爲爭門之武器的漢字廢除，那就是離開客觀現實的無理的武斷，假使我們相信自已不是脫離現實的空想家的話。</p>
<p>關於這一點，我們從日本敎育部之力行廢除漢字，而以「卡拉」代替的試騐上，可以得着證明，結果是中學二年級學生不會讀懂一篇很短的「卡拉」的信，而同樣中國如以注意字母來寫信的話，也不見得容易使人了解吧。但是注音字母在大衆語的統一運動中，仍然有其用處的，假使它在本質上並不會傷害大衆語之生長的話。至於廢除方塊字，廢除中國固有的文化，這無論如何是脫離民衆的非爭鬥的高調。也許我們今後可以從這一方面去發展學理上的討論，但是我們現在所需要的却是以漢字爲依據而建設一種有充實内容的爲一般大衆所理解的共同適用的大衆語。</p>
<p>中國電影，到現在爲止，雖然還不能深入工廠或農村，從内容以至於形式，都不能成爲大衆所迫切需要的東西。但是我們無疑義向着那一條路上走去的。同時唐納先生也承認已經有一種普通話在大衆之間流通着，而這便是大衆語聲片和默片的字幕之最好的藍本。</p>
<p>一點也不錯，誰也不能單獨創造一種標準的大衆語出來，而必需要「大衆自已來幹」，但是眞正爲大衆盡職的覺悟的知識份子，深入大衆去發現和選擇，而在電影或其他藝術作品中表現出來，也决不是一種罪過的事吧？唐納先生是不應該在這一點上來惡意的曲解的。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c251">評「一夜風流」 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＩtHappenedOneNight</p>
<p>——大光明——</p>
<p>和「太夫人」頗爲相似的，ＦrankCnpia採取了一個很少有眞實性的故事，但是他却使用了優越的表現枝巧，使人們袒信了他所說的全是眞話，有如夢幻中的眞實一樣，雖然醒轉來覺得無限的空虚，可是在做夢的當時，却感受了某種程度的安慰或悲哀。</p>
<p>的確，這一影片的故事，乃是非常空想的。假使我們承認人物的發展，不能離開經濟的或環境的决定，那末從大銀行家，千金小姐到失業的記者，那末人物都是非現實的而成爲世界上絶無僅有的人。至少他們都是故事作者心目中的好好先生，在道德的觀念上，他創造了幾個舊觀念的人們所憧憬着的好人。銀行家無條件有溺愛着一個女兒，千金小姐居然偶然的愛上了一個失業的新聞記者，而失業的新聞記者更是一個正人君子的色情狂，他爲了追隨一個女人，兩次放棄了一萬金的賞格。也許巧辯者會這樣解釋，因爲那新聞記者知道小姐是誰家女兒，獲得她的愛情而進一步的與其結婚，比較暫時的取得二萬金是更加可靠而穩妥一些的，但在畫面上告訴我們，當小姐在小旅店中向她表示愛情的時候，他是拒絶了的，這正人君子的過份誇張，是並不想在金錢上或愛情上打主意的。浮面的看去，這和後面的小姐奔新聞記者，似手是一種矛盾。而這種矛盾是在非現實的藝術作品中常時可以發現的。</p>
<p>假使說，當小姐在長途汽車帝被竊了皮箱之後，雖然是窮，但在可能範圍中（她還有四元多錢）仍可奔向她的新婚丈夫那兒去。那末後面的戲，都没有方法展開了。當然我們並不必這樣反問、但是這一故事中是在許多偶然的巧合中結構而成、而缺乏必然性，乃是極顯而易見的事實。</p>
<p>然而編劇者ＲobertRiskin却和導演者一樣，很巧妙的掩飾了這些巧合的地方，他注意着每一段落之嚴密的結構、特别是在人物的個性描寫方面，他從小地方去使幻想中的人物，活躍起來，本來是不眞實的，却强調的誇大使其幾乎眞實起來，從這一方面說，編劇者是勝利了的。</p>
<p>我們决不會忽視，「太夫人」的作者佛蘭克，卡勃拉。他在「太夫人」當中，已經給我們深切的認識。窮老太婆一世可憐，可是她因爲感人至深，得着了省長以至於流氓的竭誠帮助，結果她做了一天的太夫人，成全了她女兒和伯爵的婚事，因此她自已也跟着華貴起來。這種向上爬的說敎，已經給我們嚴正的指出了他對於觀衆的毒害。而在這一一一夜風流」中呢？他的主題是：祇要業了的新聞記者有剛毅的志氣和人格，能够竭誠愛護一個千金小姐，結果他可以一變而爲大銀行家的乘龍快壻，而平地一聲雷的華貴起來。這種庸俗的哲學，是和表現在「太夫人」中的完全一致的了</p>
<p>一種笨拙的說敎，對於儫步的觀衆並不會發生何等不良的動摇，但是他使用着所謂優秀的表現技巧，誇張的地使電影藝術成爲一種欺騙工具，使人們爲其黃色的說敎所感動，這對於比較落後的觀衆是一種可怕的毒害。</p>
<p>站在鑒賞舊的電影藝術的立塲上來說，我們承認這一位眞正電影界出身的佛蘭克卡勃拉，的確有其獨到之處。就這一影片來說，他無論在那一方面，都展示他的才能。活潑而緊凑的Ｍontage，調和的調子，趣味的濃厚，角度的靈活，人物的個性之把握，都是純電影藝術的地，很勝利的獲得了他的成功。假使僅就這些地方，我們是没有方法來找出他的缺點的。我們必然要將内容與形式化而爲一，整個的去批判他，那末，我們要求電影藝術是百分之百表現眞實，决不是將它當作欺騙說敎而使用。否則祇是表現美國的電影藝術發展到了最高度而走向没落的途中。以高度的表現技巧去服務於黃色的宣傳，將使這宣傳變爲深入而可怕。電影藝術在卡勃拉手中成爲可咒詛的東西了。這是我們所當嚴正的指出的。</p>

<p>吉弟嘻嘻笑了起來道：「哦，就是那個小朋友」！那個美少年抱歉萬份地說道：「我聽見你那樣稱讚我，我覺得頭裏有些暈陶陶的，想不到竟把車子推翻了」。憶迪問道：「你呌什麽名字」？那少年看着她微笑道：「湯姆」。憶迪看看他，確是一位很俟美的少年，就禁不住亦笑道：「好，湯姆，我們的話全給你聽到了」。湯姆於是趁這當口恐嚇道：「我請你們吃中飯，好不好？不然的话，我拿你們講的話去告訴潘甚」。吉弟亦在一旁央告道：「憶迪，你答應了吧」！湯姆看着吉弟這：「在立道那裏，還有一個很好看的游泳敎師哩」。憶迪至終答應了，一來是吉弟苦苦求着，無法拒絶，一來是湯姆一勁兒那樣對她媚笑着，使她無法抵抗了。</p>
<p>他們在立道吃了中飯，就跑到海邊土去游水。那裏果然有一個游泳敎師，和湯姆所說的不相上下。吉弟和那個游泳敎師認識了。就兩個人躱在一個沙堆後面去談情去了，讓湯姆陪着憶迪在一頂大楊傘底下休息着。湯姆一勁兒看着憶迪，似有愛不忍釋之意。憶迪游泳了一回之後，嬌喘嘘地躺在沙上，湯姆看了，未免動情。他問道：「舒服嗎」？憶迪看了他一看，也覺得芳心怦怦然，但她却自已提醒了她自已丨她是一個好女子，她來到棕橺海濱，是有一定的用意的。她牢牢地將潘其兩個字記在心頭。她於是勉强地答道：「當然，很舒服」。湯姆道：「我們可以天天到這裏來玩的」。憶迪霍的一下子坐了起來說道：「湯姆，你聽着，我們兩個人看不少相同的地方。我們可以算得是同道中人了。我亦不用和你裝腔作勢了……」湯姆聽到那裏，覺得完全是他父親的口吻，就不覺喊了一聲：「哦？怎麽樣呢」？憶迪道：「簡直的說吧。我此來的目的，是要嫁一個百萬富翁的」。湯姆道：「你說的就是潘先生嗎」？憶迪道：「那亦不一定。或者他的朋友亦可以」。湯姆亦坐了起來了，慢慢地說道：「錢並不是什麽最重要的東西。最繁的是你能够和一個能使你瘋狂的人在一起」。他凑近了她，一回兒他們兩個人的臉，貼在一起了。憶迪覺得很着急的，要想站起來，但是湯姆用脚一勾，將牠絆倒了。湯姆趁着她倒下來的時候，將她一樓，樓在自已的懷裏吻着她。在那一霎那問，憶迪忘記了矜持，亦情不自禁地儘他吻着。但是她突然問又將他推開了。用盡氣力爬了起來，厲聲對着湯姆道：「快拿浴室的鑰匙給我」丨湯姆求告着道：「憶弟，我不會使你失望的」。憶迪又看了他一眼，嬌嗔着道：「爲什麽我們不能做眞朋友呢？我是一切眞心的」。他笑了。她發火的時候，還那樣可愛。唉，她快活的時候，該當怎麽樣呢？於是他說道：「好，我們就做眞朋友吧。我先來給你一個眞憑實據……你看」！他手指着前面海上一隻美麗的大游艇道：「那就是潘其的游艇」。憶迪一望，喜出望外道：「哦，果然是的」！湯姆道：「你看，主人的旗，掛得高高的，那就是表示潘其現在在船上哩。讓我來呌一隻小船，送你上游艇，好不好」？憶迪聽了，睜着大眼，咕嚕三嚕的轉着，說道：你眞是個好人，但是讓找自已去呌船吧」。她自已心裏盤算着，要想擺脫那個少年了。（未完）</p>

<p>Fuzhou Implements Special Martial Law</p>
<p>Although Rumors Abound, People's Hearts Remain Steady</p>
<p>Security in Min (Fujian) Is Determined to Be Worry-Free</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Provincial Government reported that bandits were causing disturbances in the Shuikou and Baisha areas. Troops were immediately dispatched to block and suppress them. Airplanes were also sent for reconnaissance. The forces at the front are strong and should be able to quell the unrest. The defenses in the rear are solid, and the security of the provincial capital is absolutely guaranteed. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chiang Ting-wen telegraphed on the third day that the bandits disturbing northern Fujian had retreated to Changting after being blocked and attacked by Wei Lihuang and troops stationed in Yanping. Shuikou and Youxi were tense for a time, but now they are as peaceful as usual. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Luo Binghui's remaining bandits, numbering several thousand, after fleeing to Zhanghu, Ban Huangtian Valley, and other places, are wantonly looting. Refugees are fleeing to the Wankou area. Yesterday, the authorities telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Ting-wen, Wei Lihuang, and friendly armies about the bandit situation in northern Fujian, requesting a concerted effort to suppress them. The forces at the front are strong. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Military sources say that heavy troops are now deployed between Shayong and Yanji, cutting off bandit communications, making it easy to eliminate them. The province began implementing special martial law on the evening of the first. Although there are many rumors, people's hearts remain steady. This morning, provincial aircraft flew to the front for reconnaissance. It is said that the bandits are in a state of panic and are likely to scatter and collapse. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) On the afternoon of the second, important political and military figures in the province had meticulous plans at the Provincial Government to clear out the remaining bandits along the upper reaches of the river. Provincial aircraft continued to fly to the front for reconnaissance this afternoon. There are no bandits at Shuikou. Yanping is peaceful. Scattered bandits between Youxi, Kou, and Minqing Gutian are surrounded by our large army and are not worth mentioning. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) On the second, the Provincial Government ordered Wang Jinxiu and Wang Jingjiu to supervise the suppression of scattered bandits in Youxi Kou, Zhangwan Ban Valley, and other places to ensure local peace. Wang Jingjiu will go to the front to supervise the troops after his department is deployed. (Second Day Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Our Fourth Column, Li's division, again repelled the bandits in the northern territory of Liancheng, taking advantage of the victory to advance. (Second Day Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The magistrate of Dehua County telegraphed that the Red bandits of Datian have retreated to Sanbao. There are no bandits in Datian. (Third Day Central News Agency Electric)</p>

<h3 id="e2">To Handle Transfer Matters <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Chai Shan said that the handover of Malanyu and the Eastern Tombs will wait until the water recedes in Pingdong. I will go to Malanyu to handle the transfer and inspect the local situation. Unfinished matters in the war zone must be carried out according to the principles of the Dalian Conference after MalanYao is received. The incident of British troops staying for exercises at Yu Pass has been resolved. The British troops are still conducting exercises near Yu Pass and are scheduled to end on the fifth. After the mixed army of Li Shouxin near Duolun in eastern Chahar was disarmed, no other troops were sent to take over the defense. Colonel Doihara previously went from Shenyang to Rehe to meet Matsui, the head of the special service agency in Chengde. After finishing his work in Rehe, he also returned to Shenyang by plane. The report of coming to Ping is inaccurate. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that our side has already completed the organization of the Qing Tombs Preservation Committee and everything is ready. We only wait for the Japanese troops in Malanyu to withdraw before our side can exercise sovereignty as desired. The preservation of the Qing Tombs will still be handled according to the previous methods, without adding any troops or conditions. Currently, there are still 30 tomb-guarding soldiers, but their weapons are not complete. As soon as the Japanese soldiers withdraw, we will issue weapons to arm them, and they will immediately be responsible for guarding the tombs. Yu also said that the Japanese troops in Malanyu, Sanchahe Bridge, Jianchang, and other places were originally agreed upon in the Tanggu Truce to completely withdraw outside the Great Wall within one year. Later, the Japanese side repeatedly procrastinated, saying that they would withdraw after the barracks outside the Great Wall were built. Now, the Tanggu Truce has been exceeded by half a year, and the Japanese barracks should have been completed, so they should abide by the spirit of the truce and withdraw. My reorganization of the war zone is full of problems and is limited by the truce and the rampant behavior of Japanese and Korean ronin, so it cannot be implemented as desired. The Japanese side in turn uses the pretext of instability in my war zone to blame me. If the Japanese troops withdraw and the Japanese and Korean ronin are slightly suppressed, then I will have my own methods for rectifying the local area. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>

There is also no report on when Yin Tong will leave Mogan Mountain and return north. (Third Day Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is rumored that Yin Tong has completed discussions with Huang Fu on the results of the Dalian Conference on Mogan Mountain and will go down the mountain to Nanjing within a few days.

Since the brigade was reorganized, the number of personnel has been replenished, weapons have been issued, and the old and weak officers and soldiers have been eliminated. The military pay has also increased compared to before. Between Lingyuan County and Chifeng, the Japanese plan to build a railway. The earthwork is contracted to the Lin Shen Shares Zutinger Company.

Shi Yousan is reporting secret matters in North China to undermine the current improved relations between China and Japan, so that his plan can be realized. Although the Yutian Security Team has replaced the captain Han Dianbang with Sun Jizhou as the acting captain, it is difficult to consider it peaceful.

<h3 id="e9">British and Japanese Warships Become Confrontational <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>There Was a Conflict Between Soldiers From Both Sides</p>
<p>Rumors in Beiping of Conflict Between British and Japanese Troops in Yu Pass</p>
<p>Related Parties All Say They Have Not Received Such Reports</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese troops in Tangshan continue to exercise tirelessly. On the second, a small team of Japanese troops held a combat exercise at the shooting range in Xishan, from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM. On the morning of the second, two Japanese destroyers and three cruisers arrived in Qinhuangdao, confronting five British warships anchored there. On the afternoon of the first, soldiers from a Japanese warship originally anchored in the port landed and had a conflict with the British sailors. Although this has been reported here, the details are unknown. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The dispute over the exercise between the British and Japanese troops stationed in Yu Pass has not yet been resolved. This morning, it was rumored in Pingfang that British soldiers had a conflict with Japanese troops during an exercise outside Dongluo City on the first, resulting in many British soldiers being killed or injured. The Japanese side then dispatched a train of troops and six warships, and the situation was once serious. According to inquiries from relevant parties, they have not received an official report, and the truth is unknown. However, Chai Shan strongly denied it. British Minister Cadogan is scheduled to come to Ping from Beidaihe tonight, and the facts should be clear. Sixty-four British soldiers arrived in Ping this morning by the Pingyu through train from Tanggu. After getting off the train, they were led by military attache Vox to the British barracks in Dongjiaomin Lane. It is said that it is a rotation. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The British Embassy revealed that the story of the British-Japanese misunderstanding in Yu Pass due to the exercise issue is inaccurate because the embassy has not received such reports. The British minister is vacationing at Haidian and has not made preparations to return to Ping. The Japanese Charge d'Affaires Wakasugi only came to the embassy once and did not make any negotiations. Chai Shan said that the Yu Pass exercise issue is now being resolved through diplomatic channels and there is no possibility of a change. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today's rumors in Pingfang that British and Japanese troops had a conflict in Yu Pass have not been reported by any relevant parties, which is obviously inaccurate. Today at 1:00 PM, 40 Japanese soldiers, fully armed, carrying machine guns, carrier pigeons, etc., walked up the city wall from Hepingmen and paraded on the city wall. Another 20 Japanese soldiers were practicing street fighting on East Chang'an Street. More than 100 Japanese soldiers rode in several armored vehicles to visit the Western Hills and returned to the city that evening. (Third Day Electric)</p>
<p>Sikang Provincial Establishment Transition Measures</p>
<p>Huang Musong Suggests Temporarily Calling It a Special Zone</p>
<p>After Research, It Is Decided to Establish a Political Affairs Committee</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Musong previously telegraphed the central government, suggesting that Sikang be temporarily changed to a special zone. After detailed research by the General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, they all believed that the special zone system had been abolished for a long time. While the central government is actively suggesting the establishment of Sikang Province, before the funding has been properly planned and the Kang-Tibetan disputes have been completely resolved, it is best to establish a Sikang Political Affairs Committee as a transitional measure for the establishment of Sikang Province. The opinion has been submitted to the central government for review. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan, based on the suggestions of the people of Xikang sent by Huang Musong regarding the development of the postal service in Xikang, has forwarded them to the Ministry of Communications for handling.

<h3 id="e27">The Question of the Persistence or Abolition of Rickshaws in the Shanghai Municipal Concession <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>There are people whose hair is disheveled, whose faces are dirty, whose hands and feet are calloused, who eat coarsely, and who wear tattered clothes. They crawl under the scorching sun, in the fierce heat, in the strong winds, and in the heavy rain, carrying heavy loads and pulling long distances. Human suffering has reached its extreme. Yet, their earnings are not enough to support their parents or raise their wives and children. Is this not a true depiction of a rickshaw puller? Anyone who cares about humanity will be moved by the plight of the rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>However, all systems have their origins and backgrounds. The rickshaw system has existed in Chinese society for decades and is not comparable to contrived creations. During these decades, the import of Western transportation tools, such as cars, motorcycles, airplanes, and ships, has been constant. Yet, the rickshaw system has maintained its status quo and its influence is spreading to inland towns. Why is this so? Is it not because of the bankruptcy of Chinese agriculture, the decline of people's livelihoods, and the poor rural farmers who cannot find a livelihood in the fields? They flock to the towns, relying on the rickshaw owners, and consider it fortunate to get a rickshaw to eke out a living. Is it not also because the economic power of Easterners is weak, and their concept of time is not strong? There is a cheap means of transportation like rickshaws, which can be used to carry heavy loads and travel long distances, comforting them and being better than nothing. Therefore, the formation of the rickshaw system is half due to the surplus of labor and half due to social demand. We sincerely hope that those who are responsible for local administration in the towns where rickshaws operate will extend a helping hand to these poor wretches in human hell. But we also do not want to ignore the origins and background of this system. Otherwise, even with full enthusiasm and good intentions, loving them may harm them, and giving them life may lead to their death. It is important not to overcorrect and go to extremes.</p>
<p>The authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council are responsible for improving the lives of rickshaw pullers in the concession. We already know the general principles and policies they follow. What we cannot but discuss is what attitude the council holds towards the future of rickshaws in the concession. We know that the Municipal Council's Transportation Problems Committee from 1924 to 1926 once suggested gradually reducing the number of rickshaws, which was approved by the council. (See page 117 of the 1933-34 Rickshaw Committee Report) The recent Rickshaw Committee also clearly stated that "society must look forward to a time when rickshaws can be gradually eliminated from the streets of Shanghai." (See page 131 of the same report) The proposal that "the Municipal Council should reconsider this matter in two or three years" (see pages 131 and 132 of the same report) has been adopted by the council. All these points, in conjunction with the first power of the Rickshaw Management Office (which is "the Management Office should make timely suggestions on gradually reducing rickshaw licenses," see the news column of this newspaper on March 22 this year), are enough to make people feel that the Municipal Council has a tendency to gradually reduce and even eliminate rickshaws in the concession. However, the time is still undetermined.</p>
<p>We must note that the Rickshaw Committee's recommendations are as many as sixteen. The first three are related to the organization of a new company. Although they have not yet been adopted by the Municipal Council, they have not been discarded. As the committee said, if the company is established one day, the results of its operation will be the basis for the Municipal Council to consider reducing the number of rickshaws.</p>
<p>We do not want to defend the rickshaw system and express considerable sympathy for the Rickshaw Committee's proposals. However, the direction of the Municipal Council's policies concerns the livelihood of more than 100,000 civilians and the convenience of transportation in the city. Therefore, we dare to advise the council authorities to think deeply and consider all aspects of this important issue. It is better to be cautious beforehand than to regret it afterward. Looking at the Municipal Council's policies, on the one hand, it is making "rickshaws continue to exist" (see the interview with Mr. Massey of the Rickshaw Management Office in the news column of this newspaper on July 31). On the other hand, it inevitably has a tendency to gradually reduce and even eliminate rickshaws, which seems to be wandering on a fork in the road, ambiguous. How can it reconcile its contradictory mission without being accused of "not completing its virtue"? We hope that the council authorities will thoroughly consider the future of the entire rickshaw system in the midst of this serious turmoil and then determine its future direction.</p>

<p>Puppet Ambassador Directly Subordinate to the Prime Minister or the Japanese Emperor</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of unifying the organizations stationed in Manchuria, Army Minister Hayashi gave the following statement on the 3rd: Discussions are currently underway among the relevant ministries and authorities regarding this matter. However, considering the development of "Manchukuo" and Japan's century-long national policy, reforming and strengthening the organizations stationed in Manchuria is indeed a crucial plan. Moreover, the progress of this reform should transcend departmental interests and be decided based on the overall situation and its benefits. Although cabinet members have not yet exchanged opinions, the issue is significant, and it is inevitable that the relevant ministries will have differing views. However, at this time of reforming the tripartite system, the priority regarding the current situation in "Manchukuo" should be to ensure security. Under these circumstances, the plenipotentiary ambassador should be concurrently held by the commander of the military. All ministries have no objection to this point. However, how the structure below the ambassador should be organized, and how to establish contact with "Manchukuo" regarding diplomacy, economy, industry, etc., is still under discussion. There are various opinions, such as placing the stationed ambassador, i.e., the commander of the military, not under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Foreign Affairs or the Minister of the Army, but either under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister or directly under the Emperor. It is hoped that this will not be constrained by the interests of any particular department and that thorough research will be conducted before a decision is made. (3rd, Japanese United Press)</p>

<p>National Referendum to Be Held Regularly</p>
<p>Defense Force Commander Orders Subordinates to Support Him</p>
<p>Only the Business Community and the Right-Wing Can Restrain Him</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany is scheduled to hold a national referendum on August 19th to vote on the law appointing Hitler as president and merging the two positions of president and prime minister. Voters only need to indicate their approval or disapproval. It is expected that the majority of the people will vote in favor of this proposal.</p>
<p>Defense Minister General von Blomberg, as commander-in-chief of the standing army, has issued a circular to his subordinates, pledging allegiance to Hitler, and said, "I am the commander-in-chief, and as a brave soldier, I am prepared to fulfill this oath with my life at any time."</p>
<p>Hitler currently does not want to assume the title of President, but wishes the people to call him Leader and Prime Minister. Hitler sent a letter to the Minister of the Interior, explaining this intention, and asked the Minister of the Interior to prepare a free and secret national referendum. He wishes the cabinet to authorize him to perform the duties of the president in accordance with the constitution, subject to popular approval. However, there should be no competitors for him in the referendum on August 19th. The authorities have warned newspapers not to comment on this new law, whether in favor or against it.</p>
<p>Newspapers now refer to Hitler as the leader driven by the general trend, and as Hindenburg's living legacy. With the death of President Hindenburg, the forces restraining Hitler's actions no longer exist. Hitler seems to be able to carry out his National Socialism at will, but in reality, the Defense Force will be a powerful check, and industrialists and the right-wing led by Vice-Chancellor von Papen will also have a way to restrain him.</p>
<p>Hitler was delighted to hear the news that the Defense Force had sworn to support him, as he was initially concerned that the Defense Force might oppose his assumption of the presidency. (3rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Defense Minister General von Blomberg announced today that all officers and soldiers of the army and navy have sworn allegiance to Führer Hitler and regard him as the supreme leader of the German Defense Force. Propaganda Minister Goebbels will use various propaganda methods to support Hitler in the national referendum. Thousands of members of the Stormtroopers and the Hitler Youth will be responsible for distributing leaflets and arranging meetings. Two hundred thousand loudspeakers are currently being installed to broadcast speeches and show films of the Nazi Party's programs throughout the country. The National Socialist Party is now trying its best to ensure that every citizen votes, so it is expected that the turnout will be close to one hundred percent. (3rd, Reuters)</p>

The location of Hindenburg's state funeral is Tannenberg in East Prussia, where there is a great monument commemorating Hindenburg's extraordinary military achievements in the Battle of Tannenberg during the Great War. The date of the state funeral is set for Tuesday next week. A book of condolences has been prepared at the Presidential Palace in Berlin. The first to sign were the foreign diplomatic representatives, with the first person being Mr. de Heringny, representative of the Italian Emperor. Colonel Wegand of the French General Staff also went to express condolences on behalf of Army Minister Pétain. All departments of the Presidential Palace have been decorated with black纱, and a wreath has been placed on the bust of the President. In accordance with the wishes of the late President and his family, those who offer condolences to Hindenburg are requested not to offer wreaths, but to use the equivalent amount of money to help poor compatriots. Showing grief to the late President in this way will especially comfort his soul in the afterlife. (3rd, National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) According to what is known today, the last time the late President exercised his authority was on July 30th, when he appointed Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank, as acting Minister of Economics for six months, because the current Minister, Schmitt, was sick and on leave. This appointment was announced today by the new President, Hitler. If Schmitt's condition does not improve, Schacht will become the Minister of Economics. (3rd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Tannenberg, where President Hindenburg rose to fame during the Great War, will also be the final resting place for his remains. During the European War, the Russian army launched a major offensive. Hindenburg lured the enemy deep into the Masurian Lakes, and then annihilated them in one fell swoop. From then on, the German Eastern Front had no worries. In memory of this extraordinary feat, it has been decided to bury the remains of this heroic statesman there with a grand ceremony at eleven o'clock on Tuesday morning. The date and location were officially announced last night. The entire country is now in mourning, officially ordered by the government. However, the people, having lost the leader who sacrificed everything for the country throughout his life, did so without waiting for orders. The gold flag presented by the people to express their gratitude to the president was lowered from the top of the villa in Neudeck at 9:20 yesterday morning, and the whole country immediately followed suit by flying flags at half-mast. Even thatched huts hung black cloth in front of their doors to express their grief. Today, telegrams from all over the world have been sent to the German people and the late President's son to express condolences, from heads of state to ordinary villagers, in countless numbers. (3rd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is now known that on the evening of Monday, a memorial meeting for the late President will be held at the Tannenberg Memorial, 15 miles from Neudeck. The coffins of both Mr. Hindenburg and Mr. Hindenburg will be placed in the inner courtyard of the memorial wall, where Hitler will deliver a eulogy. A team of Hitler's elite soldiers and Brownshirts will march around the coffin, while cannons will be fired to mark the occasion. Finally, thousands of Stormtroopers, each carrying a torch, will march in a parade. After the memorial service, the coffin will be sent back to Neudeck to be buried in the family cemetery with a simple ceremony in accordance with his will. (3rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Berlin) At the cabinet meeting in the afternoon, chaired by the new President and Prime Minister Hitler, Hitler handed over a letter to Interior Minister Frick for publication, stating that he had abolished the title of President and changed it to "Leader of the German People" and "Prime Minister".

<p>(Berlin) The plebiscite for Prime Minister Hitler to succeed the President has now been decided by today's cabinet meeting to be held on Sunday (August 19th). Hitler issued a declaration on this matter, stating, "Now, due to the misfortune of the country, the question of my succession to the head of state has arisen. I am now issuing two orders in accordance with the regulations: (1) The great achievements of the late President have given the title of Federal President a special meaning, so according to our feelings, this title is inseparable from the late President. Therefore, whether formally or informally, I will be referred to as Leader and Prime Minister, and this rule will be permanently observed in the future; (2) I wish that my succession to the presidential powers, as officially decided by the cabinet, should obtain the clear approval of the German people. I firmly believe that the authority of any government is conferred by the people, so I request that the cabinet's decision be immediately submitted to a public vote." (2nd, National Telegram)</p>

<p>The Third Perpetrator Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Vienna's new Prime Minister, Dr. Schuschnigg, met with representatives of the press for the first time today, expressing the new government's willingness to reconcile with the Socialist Party. He reportedly stated that he believes in treating everyone equally and that the government will never return to the days of workers and farmers being enemies of each other, nor will it return to the days of parliamentary democracy. However, in the new "Guild" system of Austria, interference with labor rights will be out of the question. The government will soon show the world that the new government is supported by the majority of the people. By the Prime Minister's last words, it is implied that the government intends to hold a plebiscite. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) According to sources in Rome, the Austrian government recently discovered documents proving German involvement in the Vienna incident of July 25th. The Italian and Austrian governments believe that if the major powers decide to have external negotiations with Germany, then these documents should be used as the basis for negotiations. The position taken by the United Kingdom on this matter is the same as that expressed by Foreign Secretary Simon in the House of Commons. The British government does not intend to create anything in this regard, but it is heard that if Austria takes a firm attitude towards Germany, making the German government understand that Austria is determined to have its independence respected, then it will be easier for the major powers and Austria to provide effective support. (2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>The third perpetrator of the attack on the Prime Minister's Office in Vienna on July 25th, M. Mikutel, was sentenced to life imprisonment today. M. Hutter was once an officer in the standing army, then left the military and became a timber merchant. Due to several business failures, he became a carpenter to make a living. Hutter admitted in court that he had participated in the attack on the Prime Minister's Office wearing the uniform of an army major. Former Vienna Mayor Seitz and other Socialist Party leaders who were imprisoned for the unsuccessful uprising in February were invited to be released today. This is clear evidence that the authorities have ended the battle with the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party has strongly opposed the government so far. Former Mayor Seitz is highly respected by the Austrian people. It is hoped that his release can appease the Socialist Party, as the new Prime Minister Dr. Schuschnigg knows very well that it is virtually impossible to fight both the National Socialist Party and the Socialist Party at the same time. The number of insurgents arrested in Carinthia Province has reached 2,000 to date. (2nd, Reuters)</p>

<p>The Grandson of the Deposed Emperor Says Restoration Depends on Public Opinion</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. government officials and the diplomatic corps are paying close attention to the German political situation after the death of German President Hindenburg. Some fear that the European crisis will become increasingly serious. As for Germany's internal affairs, the relationship between the National Socialist Party leaders and the military will become more complicated. There are three speculations about Germany's future: (1) Hitler concentrates power in himself and continues as he is; (2) A restoration is carried out to maintain the people's concept of unity, as Hindenburg did for Germany when he was alive; (3) The National Socialist Party fails, and the result may be a civil war caused by the Communist Party trying to seize power. Secretary of State Hull today sent a telegram to the German government to express his condolences, saying, "The world has lost one of its most outstanding figures." (2nd, National)</p>
<p>Prince Louis Ferdinand, grandson of the deposed German Emperor in Windsor, England, commented on the death of President Hindenburg, saying, "A restoration in Germany will not be realized unless the people agree."

<p>(Moscow) The following TASS communiqué has been published here: Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov and Lithuanian Foreign Minister Lozoraitis exchanged views and expressed their satisfaction with the permanent and unchanging friendly relations between the two countries and their cultural and economic ties. Litvinov and Lozoraitis observed the international situation and acknowledged that the common desire of the Soviet and Lithuanian governments to maintain and consolidate peace is the true basis of their friendly relations. They further concluded that the feeling of unease and anxiety has become widespread and is confirmed by the current international situation. This feeling has led them to seek a cooperative method to guarantee the security of Eastern European countries. The most appropriate cooperative method for this purpose can be found in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, which has now received the support of the majority of the countries expected to sign it. Major European countries have also almost completely agreed, and the Soviet and Lithuanian governments have long indicated their quick approval of direct participation. Litvinov and Lozoraitis also noted during the talks that they were very pleased with the declarations recently made in Moscow by Estonian Foreign Minister Seljamaa and Latvian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bilanis, expressing the active attitude of Estonia and Latvia towards this pact. According to Litvinov and Lozoraitis, in addition to the direct purpose of consolidating peace in Eastern Europe and promoting world peace, this pact must also improve mutual relations between the signatory countries without harming the status of any of them.

<h3 id="e63">Lottery Ticket Sales Agency for the Benefit of the People <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to people from Yuguan, since the Japanese imitated our aviation lottery tickets and issued lottery tickets for the benefit of the people in the Northeast, they have received a lot of criticism. Recently, in order to expand their business, the Japanese have set up a lottery ticket sales agency for the benefit of the people in Yuguan City, selling these lottery tickets. A Japanese person is serving as the agent. The Puppet State Council previously sent personnel to Yuguan to investigate the sales of drugs in the area. As a result, they believed there was a need to establish an opium monopoly office. The Japanese have already found suitable housing in Dongluocheng and will be able to establish it soon.

<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Nanchang on the 3rd stated that according to reliable news from Ji'an, Kong Hechong, the former puppet commander-in-chief of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Military Region and the commander of the puppet 16th Division, a well-known bandit leader, was dismissed by the puppet central government due to repeated defeats by our army and transferred to study at the Red Army School. His former position was filled by Gao Yongsheng. Later, Gao, whose crimes were heinous, was captured alive by us and died after falling from a cliff. The remaining bandits were leaderless and scattered in all directions. Their situation has reached its limit. Recently, Kong graduated from the school and saw that the general situation was over and could not be reversed. He also felt that internal factions were divided, and the entire system was about to collapse. Moreover, the old department had become fish on the chopping board and was beyond redemption. At the same time, our army's encirclement and suppression were advancing step by step, and we were treating those who were reforming with leniency and generosity, not blaming the past but giving preferential treatment. Therefore, he resolutely decided to surrender alone to the 36th Army under Zhou Hunyuan on the 25th. Commander Zhou immediately treated him with courtesy and reportedly sent personnel to escort the bandit to the Nanchang camp for verification the next day. The bandit forces in western Jiangxi are on the verge of collapse, and the rest will be easier to annihilate. (Central News Agency dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Has been handed over by the West Route Army to Nanchang</p>
<p>Root of Great Evil Removed from Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan</p>
<p>Jiujiang Communication: Kong Hechong, a bandit leader whose power, position, and title were comparable to those of Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, He Long, Xu Xiangqian, and Fang Zhimin among the communists, was recently captured alive by the West Route Army. The center of gravity of the Red bandits in the Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan border area has been lost, and a root of great evil has been removed from the three provinces. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After the Zhu, Mao, and Peng factions of the Communist bandits shifted their targets from southwestern Jiangxi to southeastern Jiangxi, they assigned Kong Hechong to be responsible for the rear guard, appointing Kong as the commander-in-chief of the puppet Sixth Army Group, commanding the puppet Jiangxi-Hubei-Hunan and Jiangxi-Hunan Military Regions. His troops included the puppet 16th, 17th, and 18th Armies, as well as the Independent 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Divisions and bandit gangs in Jiangxi-Hubei border, Jiangxi-Hunan border and other places. The puppet independent regiments and guerrilla teams of the 42 counties under the jurisdiction of the West Route Army were also under Kong's control, totaling no less than 70,000 to 80,000 people, with approximately 50,000 to 60,000 guns. The sole task of the Kong bandit was to destroy the Hunan-Hubei and Nanchang-Jiujiang railways, obstruct transportation on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers, disrupt the rear defenses of the National Army, and contain the National Army's encirclement and suppression. However, since the West Route Army has been continuously encircling and suppressing, implementing relentless pursuit, strict blocking, and tight encirclement, the bandit area of the Kong bandit has shrunk daily, and its strength has decreased. Key bandits such as Gao Yongsheng, the commander of the puppet 16th Army, have been captured, Yi Yong, the president of the puppet Red Army School, and Li Youjun, the political director of the puppet 16th Army, have surrendered one after another. Yu Xingzhou, the commander of the puppet Independent 3rd Division, has also been captured alive recently. With defeats but no victories, the generals were defeated, and the soldiers were lost. Kong was removed by the puppet central government in Ruijin from all puppet positions as commander-in-chief of the Sixth Army Group and the Three-Province Border Military Region, and was ordered by Zhu Mao to be transferred to Ruijin to serve in a certain empty puppet position. After receiving the order, Kong disguised himself and secretly fled along the Jiangxi-Hubei border to western Jiangxi, attempting to sneak across the Gan River in Taihe and Wan'an on the west bank of the Gan River, and enter Ruijin via Xingguo. However, in the middle section of the Gan River, in the Wan'an and Taihe area, the transportation between the bandits on both sides of the river could still be carried out secretly in the past due to the thin strength of the National Army. Since the National Army □Column □□Army □□Division joined the middle section of the Gan River, the defense has become more consolidated than before, and the blockade is also tighter. Therefore, when the Kong bandit was about to cross the Gan River, he was captured by a sentry of the 36th Army of the West Route. After being identified as Kong Hechong, he was properly sent to Nanchang by the army. He is currently still in the province and is being treated with great courtesy. A chief of staff of a certain division had an old relationship with Kong and had a long conversation with him. Kong revealed his regret for not doing the right thing in the first place. It is heard that after being questioned by a senior military organ, he may be given a chance to reform himself, so as to serve as a raft for ferrying the bandits in the three-province border area out of hell and into heaven.</p>
<p>According to news from Ji'an, Kong's strength in the Jiangxi-Hubei border area has been reduced by more than half in recent years, and there is no way to escape. The orders from the puppet central government are also extremely strict, requiring him to atone for his sins, otherwise he will be executed. Kong was in a dilemma, with no way to advance or retreat. The only way to survive was to surrender, but there was no opportunity. A certain division was transferred to Wan'an, and Kong and its chief officer had a student relationship. Therefore, he resolutely surrendered to the chief officer. Therefore, when a certain division escorted Kong to the 36th Army, he was treated with great courtesy. When escorted to Nanchang, he was treated as a guest. Some people saw him playing bamboo chess in a certain place, feeling very content. It is heard that Kong will serve the National Army to make up for his past mistakes. (July 28)</p>
<h3 id="e85">British Efforts in Far East Defense <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Centered on the Malay Peninsula</p>
<p>The Entire Island Will Be Dotted with Airfields</p>
<p>Singapore Special Dispatch: In my previous dispatch, "The Southern British and Dutch Territories' Defense Amidst the Emergency Atmosphere of World Affairs," I already reported to my compatriots the active preparations for war by Britain and the Netherlands in their East Asian colonies. Now, I will cite another incident to further corroborate this. What is this incident? It is the British plan to implement a new aviation program throughout the Malay Peninsula. According to the general outline of this plan, from the southern tip to the northern end of the Malay Peninsula, an airfield will be built every fifty miles, densely covering the entire island with airfields. In the event of an emergency, aircraft will be used as an important tool for defending territory. Readers who have studied the general trend of the world on a daily basis should not find it difficult to understand that the reason why British power can expand so much in the Far East is entirely due to the strength of its colonies. Among Britain's colonies in East Asia, the most notable are Hong Kong, Australia, Malaya, and India. If we consider the current state of Anglo-Japanese antagonism, Hong Kong is closest to Japan. If Britain and Japan unfortunately engage in warfare, Hong Kong will be on the front line. However, Hong Kong is only a small island, unable to be self-sufficient in food and everything else, making it difficult to defend for long. Therefore, although Britain pays close attention to Hong Kong's defense, it must also plan for a place of retreat. Although Australia's position is also very important, it is ultimately shielded by the Philippines, Borneo, New Guinea, and other islands, making it difficult for Japan to invade. Therefore, at present, the most important of Britain's Far Eastern colonies is none other than Malaya. Firstly, because the area is very close to Britain's lifeline, India. Secondly, because Singapore Island in Malaya is a hub for Eurasian transportation and a key point in Britain's Three S Policy. Therefore, if Malaya encounters any unforeseen events, not only will Britain's position in India be shaken, but Britain's colonies in the Far East may also be disjointed. Therefore, the British government's gaze must focus on Malaya and regard Malaya as the center of British defense in the Far East.</p>
<p>Britain's deployment in Malaya did not begin today, but it has become more active since the September 18th Incident. For example, spending tens of millions of pounds to construct Singapore's naval harbor. After the completion of the harbor, the British navy in the Far East will have a very strong base, and there will be no worries. However, what Britain is currently most concerned about is strictly guarding against air strikes from other countries. At the same time, it also plans to use air power to supplement the inadequacy of naval and land forces. This is why the new aviation plan for the entire Malay Peninsula has recently been launched.</p>
<p>The national character of the world's peoples is different. Peoples who like to exaggerate will always boast first when doing things, which easily arouses suspicion from others. However, the British prefer to remain silent. Before achieving considerable success in anything, they will never utter a word lightly. We can see this from the attitude of Air Commodore Smith of the British Far East Air Command. Smith has been in Singapore for a long time, but he has never given a public statement. He only recently announced this plan to the press, which shows that Britain has a firm grasp on this new plan and is making progress.</p>
<p>In fact, the aviation industry in Malaya has made considerable progress recently. For example, airplanes flying from the Netherlands to its colony of Java must stop in Singapore. The Imperial Airways has further reduced the flight time from London to Singapore to eight days. The long-distance flight from Singapore to Australia is scheduled to commence on December 11th of this year. The British Air Ministry has also successfully mapped the aeronautical charts of the South Seas Islands, and aviation clubs have been established in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Penang for civilians interested in aviation to study. Moreover, the airfield facilities from Alor Setar to Singapore are extremely well-equipped. Airfields in Sungai Petani, Penang, Taiping, Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Sitiawan, Port Klang, Sungai Nibong, Batu Pahat, and Malacca have been completed or are under planning along the entire route. Therefore, it should not be difficult to build an airfield every fifty miles throughout the Malay Peninsula. What are our compatriots thinking in light of other countries' active preparations for aviation?</p>
<h3 id="e86">Stalled Negotiations for Joint Sino-Japanese Transportation <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Sogo Returns to Tokyo, South Manchuria Railway's Revenue Not Strong Last Year</p>
<p>If Joint Transportation is Implemented, a Large Number of Products from the Puppet State Will Enter Customs</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: Since the opening of through traffic between Peiping and Shenyang, the Japanese side has repeatedly requested joint transportation between the Peiping-Liaoning Railway and the South Manchuria Railway. It was originally intended to resume passenger transport on August 1st, followed by freight transport. Currently, due to incomplete procedures, the joint transportation issue has been shelved. Details from various parties are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hamaoto's Statement: According to Hamaoto, the information director of the South Manchuria Railway's Peiping branch, "Regarding the joint transportation issue between the South Manchuria and Peiping-Liaoning Railways, although I am a civil servant, I have not heard of any arrangements. The talk of starting joint transportation on August 1st is in the past. Joint transportation is not possible at the moment. Our country hopes to resume joint transportation as soon as possible to facilitate transportation and develop the industries of China, Japan, and 'Manchukuo'. It is untrue that Sogo, director of the South Manchuria Railway, came to Peiping to discuss joint transportation with Minister Gu of your country. Sogo's term expired on July 17th, and he is no longer a director of the South Manchuria Railway. Naturally, he cannot represent the South Manchuria Railway in negotiating joint transportation with China. Today, I received a telegram from Sogo stating that he has safely arrived in Tokyo. The South Manchuria Railway has extensive business development, and besides managing the railway itself, it also has economic enterprises in the railway-affiliated areas. Therefore, the successor to Director Sogo will be handled by personnel dispatched from the Ministry of Finance in Tokyo, and the candidate is still unknown. The South Manchuria Railway's revenue was not good last year. The only reason is the global economic panic and undeveloped industries. International transportation is naturally not smooth. Also, since the September 18th Incident, passenger and freight joint transportation between the South Manchuria Railway and the Peiping-Liaoning Railway has been suspended. Sino-Japanese commerce cannot proceed by land transportation. Therefore, the South Manchuria Railway's revenue is even more depressed than before," etc.</p>
<p>Pros and Cons of Joint Transportation: According to news from related parties, the Japanese economy suffered a major blow after the suspension of joint transportation between the Peiping-Liaoning and South Manchuria Railways. Therefore, the Japanese side is requesting a speedy resumption of joint transportation. If joint transportation can indeed be resumed, then the products of the puppet organization will be continuously transported into customs. The main products are: Liaoning Province has sable, otter, elk, deer, rabbit, monkey, fox, cattle, horses, sheep, sturgeon, beluga, carp, salmon, beans, wheat, millet, sorghum, potatoes, peanuts, indigo, tobacco, coal, and iron. Jilin Province has pine, fir, birch, cypress, pheasant, dove, hawk, eagle, copper, iron, and coal. Heilongjiang has donkey, mule, cattle, sheep, horse, swine, bear, tiger, squirrel, fox, sable, fish, soybeans, wheat, sorghum, corn, willow, scholar tree, elm, gold, coal, and pond salt. All can be transported by rail into the various provinces of North China for brisk sales. It is estimated that our country loses more than five million yuan annually.</p>
<p>Joint Transportation Stations: According to news from the transportation sector, the station names for the future joint transportation between the Peiping-Liaoning and South Manchuria Railways are as follows: (1) Qianmen, Peiping; (2) Fengtai; (3) Langfang; (4) Tianjin; (5) Tanggu; (6) Tangshan; (7) Guye; (8) Luanzhou; (9) Changli; (10) Qinhuangdao; (11) Yuguan; (12) Jinzhou; (13) Goubangzi; (14) Dahushan; (15) Huanggu Village; (16) Shenyang; (17) Tieling; (18) Kaiyuan; (19) Gongzhuling; (20) Changchun. Changchun is the terminus of the South Manchuria Railway. After the Russo-Japanese War, its north was named North Manchuria and its south South Manchuria. Changchun is located at the crossroads of the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and its trade scope extends to the entire Northeast. (2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Red Bandits Infest Datian <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>They Entered the City for Three Days and Then Withdrew</p>
<p>Salt and Rice are Extremely Scarce in the Bandit Area</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The Red bandits' Northern Route Army urgently attacked Shicheng and Ninghua, and the Eastern Route Army advanced from Liancheng, preparing a general attack on Changting, their last lair, which is in a perilous situation. At the end of last month, Zhu and Mao convened a military conference in Changting. Later, Zhu and Mao returned to Ruijin, and Peng Dehuai stayed in Changting. This month, the Communist bandits changed their strategy of stubbornly holding out and attempting to break through the rear, diverting the Central Army forces attacking the bandit lairs in Ninghua and Changting. On the 16th of this month, the Red bandits' Luo Binghui department broke through and fled to the Yang Yutang area northeast of Liancheng, then fled to the Shi Tao Market in Ningyang. The Central Army and the 14th Security Regiment pursued and intercepted them, and bombed them with airplanes. They then fled northeast to the northwest of Ningyang, and on the 18th, they arrived at Taoyuan Market in Datian County. The bandit leader was Chen Kaifa. Datian's defense forces only had the security regiment, which was no match. Therefore, on the 20th, they captured Datian County. Datian is located east of Yong'an, south of Youxi and Shaxian, and north of Yongchun and Dehua. The area is quite important. The Eastern Route Headquarters ordered the garrison forces in Yong'an and Shaxian, and the Dehua [missing text] Division [missing text] Brigade, to launch a three-pronged attack on Datian. However, the bandits who captured Datian only stayed in the city for three days, and on the 23rd, they abandoned the city and retreated. Chen Jing, the Datian County magistrate, fled to Dehua when the bandits captured the city. Shen Fazao happened to be personally supervising the [missing text] regiment and the 5th Security Regiment in Dehua to suppress the local bandit Chen Gongliang. Shen sent [missing text] regiment and part of the [missing text] Security Regiment to patrol and intercept the bandits on the border of Datian to prevent the bandits from fleeing south. Chen Jing was delayed in Dehua due to obstructing the water flow, and arrived in Quanzhou on the 26th. He will transfer to Fuzhou to report to the provincial government. Shen attacked Chen Gongliang's bandit lair, Dazheng Village, in Dehua and recaptured it on the 26th. Chen's troops were routed, and Chen's whereabouts are unknown. On the 27th, Shen learned from scouts that the Datian bandits had abandoned the city and retreated on the 23rd, and order in Datian was gradually being restored. Shen ordered Tan Xuede, the director of the Southern District Security Branch, to lead the [missing text] regiment and the [missing text] Security Regiment to patrol in Datian. The bandits from Datian split into groups and fled between Datian, Youxi, Yong'an, and Shaxian. The Central Army from upstream has dispatched teams to intercept and suppress them. However, the Red bandits' outward flight is not enough to resolve the crisis in their remaining bandit areas. According to refugees who recently fled from the Changting bandit area to Longyan, days ago, some bandit troops left Changting to flee elsewhere, seemingly moving towards Liancheng (referring to the aforementioned bandits fleeing to Datian). Currently, the Changting city hosts the pseudo-Fujian Soviet government, stationed with 200-300 Red Guards. There is no shortage of food, with each national currency buying about four dou of rice, and six to seven jin of pork per yuan. However, salt is extremely scarce, with only six liang purchasable per yuan. The most scarce items in the bandit area are salt, matches, and kerosene. The so-called "Red Army" is the most privileged in the bandit area. Previously, each person could receive seven qian of salt and eight matches per day, but now they can only receive three qian of salt and four matches. The general populace barely has any salt and often preserves fire, showing their predicament. Furthermore, according to Li Jingshen, the [missing text] regiment commander of the Ningyang Security [missing text] Battalion, a bandit scout captured by villagers in Chishui Township had a leather bag confiscated containing 12 cash coins, a small green note, and a piece of red cloth plaster. According to the confession, the items carried were scout identification marks. A notice has been sent to all jurisdictions. In addition, there are recently hidden groceries worth 20,000 yuan in the mountains of the Jin Feng district of Yongding. The Security [missing text] Regiment reported this and requested that a team be dispatched to search and suppress them. Goods used in the bandit area mostly enter the bandit area from Dapu and Yongding via Shanghang. The Eastern and Southern Routes are currently working together to strictly seal off the area.

<h3 id="e88">Northwest Inspection Notes by Our Special Correspondent Geng Ya <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>From Lanzhou to Xining</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st, I departed from Lanzhou, hiring a "jia wozi" from the Tiancheng shop. A "jia wozi," also known as a "shanzi," uses two mules walking in front and behind, carrying double poles with a sedan chair frame in the middle. There is a bamboo mat on top and a rope net below, which can be used to lay out boxes, bedding, and rugs. People can sit or lie on it. There were five "jia wozi" traveling together and over ten pack horses, transporting cigarettes under pressure for an Anglo-American tobacco company. The porters delayed due to added cargo, which displeased the company people, causing a great commotion. The journey started at ten o'clock. Leaving the city and crossing Leituan Bridge, there were four beggars lying and smoking opium in a vacant lot behind a monument. Their figures were emaciated and their condition was ugly. The opium poppy flowers in the fields had withered, and the seed pods were full. Tobacco leaves were planted between them, already two or three inches tall. The wheat ears had already turned yellow, and the harvest was not far off. The road was sunken, with earthen banks on both sides. Dust accumulated four or five inches deep on the road. When the wind blew, the dust flew up, blinding and suffocating. I walked on the bank road on both sides, talking to the Anglo-American tobacco company employees. I learned that there were six people in their group, including two Englishmen, one the son of a royal brigadier and the other a major capitalist. They are currently managers of the Tianjin and Zhangjiakou branches respectively. They do not shy away from the hardship of long journeys, but are willing to devote themselves to promoting their company's products. Although it is said to be their duty, their attention to and investigation of the situation in our interior is something that our country's merchants cannot hope to match.</p>
<p>The villages along the way used well water. The wells were eight or nine zhang deep and used a two-tiered pulley system to draw water. First, a circular pit about two zhang in diameter and three or four zhang deep was dug. Then, at the bottom of the pit, a well was dug down to the spring, four or five zhang deep. The well was lined with stones in a rectangular shape three feet long and two feet wide. Two rotating wooden wheels were placed on the opening, one vertical and one horizontal, with interlocking teeth. The horizontal wheel was turned by horsepower, which also rotated the vertical wheel, and the water was drawn up. In level areas, a cart must be set up separately, repeating the process twice before the water rises to ground level and is channeled to irrigate the fields. It can be seen that digging a well is very laborious and drawing water is quite difficult. The lack of water sources in Long Province is a major reason for the decline of agriculture.</p>
<p>Twenty li to Cui's Cliff, there is a temple called Baiyun Guan (White Cloud Temple). The halls and pavilions rise from the ground and are stacked on top of each other, reaching straight to the mountain peak. The atmosphere is lofty and admirable. The surveying team of the Gansu Land Surveying Bureau was there. The bureau is divided into three sections: topography, cartography, and ordinary surveying. The topography section is further divided into boundary and leveling groups. The entire province of Gansu was originally planned to be surveyed in ten years. However, due to financial difficulties, I am afraid it will not be completed on schedule. There are over 300 households in Cui's Cliff, with many people and little land. Each person owns an average of only half a mu. Each mu yields about one dou (each dou weighing 120 jin), which is not enough to eat. People rely on doing odd jobs, rafting, or peddling to alleviate the agricultural distress. Further on to Chenguanying and Gucheng, waterwheels were placed along the river. The wheel diameter is about five zhang. The original river water power is used to continuously rotate the wheels. Small buckets are obliquely attached to the wheel rim, scooping water and turning upwards, pouring it into a trough to irrigate the fields, which is quite convenient. Sandy fields are planted with tobacco, and earthen fields are planted with wheat. A good harvest is possible, truly the fertile land of western Long. There are many date gardens in Gucheng, with the green shade covering the sun. Walking through it is cool and comfortable.</p>
<p>Thirty li to Xiliugou. Villagers are devoting all their resources to building a tall temple, with new couplets on the pillars, saying "To mend the sky's hole, the hearts of all have repaired the Three Officials' Hall; to continue the earth's vein, harmonious minds have created the Five-Story Building." Reading it, I see only its empty and absurd intentions, and can imagine the height of the building. If such superstition is not eliminated, the rural economy will have one more invisible leak. It can be asserted. Moreover, I see many young men and women still wearing queues and bound feet. To cut them off and liberate them, it seems that a simple proclamation will not be effective. Walking west along the river, the high mountains to the north and south stretch for dozens of li, narrowing from wide to narrow, embracing to form a mouth. The river water rushes down, the sound like ten thousand horses galloping. Passing through the mouth, it widens into a peaceful plain. Fruit gardens are planted with walnuts, dates, apricots, plums, pears, etc., with fruitful results. It can quench thirst. We arrived in Xincheng and stayed the night, traveling 70 li. The two Englishmen, Mr. Ba, and their companions had dinner, with a wide variety of foods, as luxurious as usual. Villagers gathered to watch, seemingly drooling. In fact, their rich meals are the cream and blood of our compatriots who love foreign cigarettes. There are 200 households in Xincheng, mostly self-cultivating farmers, followed by small-scale business operators.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, we departed from Xincheng. Five li to Qingshiguan, leaning on the dangerous cliff to the left and facing the deep abyss to the right. It is quite important in western defense. Because it is paddy field here, it can be cultivated twice a year. Opium poppies and wheat in the spring, and millet, tobacco, sorghum, and cotton in the autumn. However, cotton must be planted every other year for the soil to be fertile. Each mu pays five jiao in silver in the spring and three sheng of grain in the autumn. Renting land costs ten yuan per year. In the morning, the river water was light yellow, but suddenly turned red at noon, probably due to heavy rain upstream, causing mountain torrents to erupt. The river is getting smaller and smaller to the south, even as small as only three or five zhang, but because the mountain cliffs embrace together, the water flow is unusually turbulent. Twenty li to Shansi Gulch. On the opposite bank is Dajia Gulch, where we crossed. The ferry fare is forty large (copper coins) per person, 1,000 for livestock, and 100 for donkeys. Each boat carries both people and horses, earning about 200 yuan per month. According to the boatman, "Yan Yunting, a gentleman in Xincheng, is greedily monopolizing the ferry fees in the name of public use, which is very hateful. The Yellow River ferry cannot be crossed during the rapid water of July and August. In winter and early spring, the ice prevents boats from traveling. The ferry operates for a maximum of five or six months each year. After deducting labor costs, the remainder is very meager, but Yan gets rich without lifting a finger. The suffering does not earn money, the money-making suffers no hardship, there is nothing more unfair in the world than this." As the boat approached the other shore, the Englishmen gave cigarettes to the boatmen, frequently asking if they were good. The boatmen competed to smoke them, praising them endlessly. I watched silently for a long time, feeling a slight pain in my heart.</p>
<p>There are 200 households in Dajia Gulch, all with the surname Da. Every year on the second day of the second lunar month, they go to the Da Hua household's tomb once, slaughtering pigs and sheep to pay homage to the ancestral tomb. The old and young gather to eat, all over the mountains and fields. This is called "Qingming Festival Wine," and it is a grand gathering held annually by the entire village. In recent years, the village chiefs and leaders often use their authority to collect money, falsely reporting expenses, causing lawsuits to arise, and feelings have deteriorated. According to locals, the dry land in the village is planted every other year, and nine out of ten harvests fail. It is said that no "crops" have been harvested since 1927. Grain taxes are still paid as usual, about ten yuan per dou. Because there is no yield from the fields, people mostly use wages to pay, or even borrow to live. Borrowing one yuan in February or March requires repaying four liang of tobacco in June or July (the market price is two liang per yuan). Those who lend money are local tyrants and evil gentry, and those who are exploited are small and medium-sized poor farmers. The village has a primary school with about 40 students. Each student's tuition ranges from one to five yuan. The teacher receives about 100 yuan in salary per year. The textbooks used are mixed with classics and Chinese language. Students only know how to recite sentences and do not understand the meaning of the words. Furthermore, a farmer recounted, "I have seven mu of land. If I plant wheat, I only harvest one shi and four dou, worth about seventy yuan. If I plant opium poppies, I can harvest five hundred liang, worth about two hundred and fifty yuan. After deducting fifty yuan for grain tax and two thousand ma zha (a type of fertilizer), worth sixty yuan, there are still one hundred and forty yuan left. Therefore, people mostly plant tobacco and do not plant wheat." He also said, "Ordinary farmers, if they encounter a bad year, will suffer from hunger and cold. The strong all go out to work or join the army. It is said that people feed the land, not the land feeding the people."</p>
<p>Major Flooding in Guangxi Province</p>
<h3 id="e89">Multiple Sections of the Highway Were Washed Away <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Roadbeds and Bridges Collapsed, Traffic Was Blocked</p>
<p>Losses in Yong, Long, Wu and Other Areas Exceeded 100,000</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: At the beginning of July this year, heavy rains fell in the southern provinces, and major flooding occurred in the three rivers of Guangdong Province, resulting in considerable losses. Guangxi Province has high mountains and shallow rivers, with flash floods erupting and rivers overflowing. Many agricultural products have been submerged, and the highways that have been built in various prefectures have been particularly damaged. Heavy rains have continued to fall in recent days, and accumulated water has not receded, causing traffic on various roads to be blocked. Damage to roadbeds and bridges has been particularly severe. Recently, the Guangxi Provincial Highway Bureau received reports of flood damage from various areas as follows: (1) Yongning District: A. Sections of the road near Yong City: The water submerged the Shajiang Bridge surface by about five feet, and the Yuanjiang Bridge was also submerged by more than one foot. B. The old bridge near Wutang in Yongbin and the Sanba Bridge near Taishou Market were completely washed away. A section of bridge was washed away and several sections of the roadbed were damaged near Batang. The western end of Kunlun hillside collapsed, and mud and stones filled the ditches and road surface, measuring over seven feet. Soil collapsed from the top of Pingyang'ao Mountain onto the road surface, making it impassable. Sections of the road near Liudong were washed out by the water, measuring over 700 feet in length. The stone collapse from Dongjiang Bridge to Hongniao'ao was the most severe, measuring over 60 feet long. Mud and rocks blocked the road surface, measuring over 20 feet wide. A 3,000-foot long section of roadbed was washed away from Hongniao'ao to Silong, especially the section from Silong to Taishou, where over 1,000 feet of road surface was washed away. A 2,000-foot section of road surface was destroyed from Taishou Market to Binyang. The roadbeds at both ends of the Baxiu Bridge were washed away, measuring about 400 feet long. The roadbeds at both ends of the Shigao Bridge collapsed, measuring 500 feet long. The temporary stone banks and roadbeds at both ends of the Sanba Bridge were also washed away, measuring 78 feet long. C. On the Bin-Gui road, the roadbed west of the Saoba Bridge was washed away, four feet deep and over 50 li long. Over a hundred feet of roadbed was washed away at the Gongzhang Bridge head. Although iron wires were added to bind the beams of the Dianxing Bridge when the water was about to submerge it, the force of the water was too strong and it was broken, and the bridge surface floated away. The bridges at Leijiu, Huanglian, and Qili were all submerged by water, four, five, six or seven feet deep, and many sections of roadbed were damaged. D. On the Binqian road, over a hundred feet of roadbed was washed away at the Changche Bridge head. Zouxu and nearby villages and fields were turned into swamps. The sections of the road submerged by water were six or seven feet deep and three or four thousand feet long. Over 10,000 feet of road surface were submerged in the areas of Bada, Longtan, and Guxian. E. On the Yongqin route, the Nahe and Pangjiang rivers rose sharply and surged. The stone walls on both sides of the river bridge were washed away, and the bridge surface floated away with the water, preventing people and vehicles from crossing. The rest of the road surface was also severely damaged. (2) Longzhou District: A. On the Yonglong road, in the Mingjiang section, mountain floods flowed horizontally and the river water rose sharply, causing a lot of damage to the road surface and roadbed. B. In the Longnan section, most of the roads from the Yuehua boundary to the Zhennanguan Dui Pan Shu Road were washed away. A culvert near Fengliujie was washed away, and no less than twenty landslides occurred along the road, with mud and stones filling the road surface. C. On the section from Longzhou to Shuikou, the stone bridge near the village entrance was washed away. Two zhang of the stone road near Luohui collapsed, measuring five or six feet wide and deep. The roadbed near Wayao was also damaged by several feet. (3) Wuzhou District: A. The Jinji Bridge on the Gui-Xing-Yu road was once submerged by water to a depth of over three feet and a width of over ten li, and many sections of roadbed and road surface were washed away nearby. According to the statistics, the mountain floods caused losses of about 100,000 yuan to highway bridges in the Yong, Long, Gui, and Wu districts, while other losses have not yet been estimated.

<h3 id="e90">Franco-Japanese Competition for Concessions <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Filling Pits with Soil and Forcibly Seizing Land</p>
<p>Developing Night Markets to Compete for Prosperity</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The authorities of the French Concession in Tianjin have recently been forcibly expanding their territory towards Lao Xikai, and have decided to implement various taxes and establish a Chinese Taxpayer Association on January 1st of next year, as previously reported. It is now heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is paying close attention to this matter and has determined that it cannot be resolved through negotiations with the Tianjin Municipal Government alone. Therefore, it is planned that the Ministry will gather materials and directly protest to the French Minister. The Tianjin Municipal Government has already received an order from the Ministry to investigate everything and report it to the Ministry for negotiation purposes. The French side is not concerned about our future protests and is actively developing Lao Xikai, expediting the organization of roads, the construction of streets, and the establishment of water wells. Adjacent to Lao Xikai, there was originally a pit occupying six to seven hundred mu of land, belonging to the Second District of our Township. Since last month, the French authorities, wishing to expand the Lao Xikai urban area, have ordered sanitation trucks within the concession to transport dirty soil every day to fill the pit. However, the land is located to the left of the Haiguang Temple barracks within the concession. Seeing the ambition of the French Concession, the Japanese side is unwilling to be outdone and has also ordered sanitation trucks within their concession to transport soil for filling in the same manner, both aiming to turn the water area into land and expand their respective concessions. Although our Municipal Government has learned of this matter, it has not been able to protest because they are only dumping dirty soil within their own territories and there is no obvious encroachment. However, it is expected that this will lead to further trouble in the future.</p>
<p>Currently, among the concessions in Tianjin, the French Concession is the most prosperous due to the two Tianjin Incidents. Amusement parks and commercial centers are everywhere. Most of the large department stores have moved from Hebei or the Japanese Concession. The area around Majiakou and 27th Road is bustling every night, resembling a city that never sleeps, with crowds of people thronging the streets throughout the night. The highest price for land within the concession is over 20,000 yuan per mu, and even in quieter areas, it reaches around 10,000 yuan. For example, the 39 mu of land belonging to the Tianjin Naval Medical School is worth over 500,000 yuan, even though it is not located in the city center. The soaring land prices make it difficult to purchase land, and currently, demand exceeds supply. Second to the French Concession is the Japanese Concession, but after the Tianjin Incident, its prosperity shifted to the French Concession. In the past year, the Japanese side has been trying to revive its economy, so they have established a night market on Asahi Street. Every evening at six o'clock, stalls fill the street, and pedestrians mingle. The items displayed are either opium smoking paraphernalia or various gambling tools. Although the appearance is lively, most visitors simply look and leave. As a result, the night market's effect is simply to add more trouble for the police. Next is the British Concession, which has a larger area and a more dignified attitude, without competition, resembling the demeanor of a gentleman. While the Japanese and French Concessions compete for prosperity, this gentleman maintains his traditional integrity and does not seek rapid advancement. The most unsuccessful but still competitive concession is the Italian Concession. Due to its remote location, it is difficult to develop. The Italian Concession authorities rack their brains to find ways to develop, such as building a jai alai court and allowing White Russians to set up roulette gambling dens, all as means of attracting customers. However, due to its unsuitable location, which is not a commercial area, the results are minimal. (1st)</p>
<h3 id="e91">### Songjiang Eighth District Chief Requests Thorough Investigation of Surtax <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Ye Zongcheng, Director of the First Land Tax Collection Office of this county, was previously detained for embezzlement in the case of converting farmland into grain transport. After being accused by Lu Boxin and others, the magistrate ordered Ye to be detained pending verification, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Eighth District Chief of this county has jointly petitioned the county government for a thorough investigation of the surtax. The original petition stated: "Land tax is the lifeblood of the entire county, and its collection depends on capable individuals. It has been heard that Ye Zongcheng, Director of the First Land Tax Collection Office of this county, has been detained for investigation due to suppressing the conversion of grain. Whether or not he has embezzled funds is uncertain. However, it has been observed that the actual collection of surtax in recent years has only reached 30%. The district chiefs have inquired with the local police in each district and found many discrepancies, which do not match the amount of regular tax collected. If there is a shortfall in regular tax, the surtax is unlikely to be spared. A resolution was passed at the ninth administrative meeting to dispatch officials for investigation, but it has not been implemented. The district chiefs believe that the shortfall in surtax affects the progress of various undertakings. Now that Director Ye is suspected of embezzlement, Your Honor should thoroughly investigate the matter to deter future occurrences. Your Honor's discernment will not allow any wrongdoers to escape justice. We, the district chiefs, and the people of the district eagerly await Your Honor's clear instructions."</p>

<p>This county's public security organization was reorganized in accordance with orders, with branch offices established in autonomous regions and watch posts in other market towns. However, since the reorganization, many patrol officers in various places have been accused of misconduct, especially Gu Sen, the patrol officer of Caojing, who was accused by local residents of privately handling homicide cases and accepting bribes, perverting the law. After the county government sent personnel to investigate in the countryside and confirmed the accusations, they reported back to the county. County Magistrate Jin was furious and immediately ordered Director He to summon the negligent patrol officer and detain him. Director He followed the order and telegraphed Gu Patrol Officer to come to the bureau and ordered him to be detained.</p>

<p>The Suzhou-Changshu Highway, jointly constructed by Wu County and Changshu, will be open to traffic in mid-August. The Suzhou Construction Bureau is currently planning to complete the Louqi section of the Suzhou ring road. At the same time, the Suzhou-Mudu Road, located in the scenic western suburbs of Wuzhong, is being invested in and constructed by the Sufu Long-Distance Bus Company, aiming to be completed and open to traffic on Double Ten Day (October 10th). Plans are also underway to open up a connection to the Sumu Road to directly reach the Dongshan of Taihu Lake. The Mudong Road has already been surveyed once, with a planned length of 24 li and an estimated construction cost of approximately 100,000 yuan. Simultaneously, preparations are being made to construct the Hutong Road between Huguan and Tongan Bridge, leading directly from Huguan to Suzhou.</p>

<p>Although opium prohibition in Suzhou appears to have been eliminated on the surface, opium dens still operate as usual. The other day, four ruffians went to the Guo Baofeng opium den opened by Guo Yushi in Cao Hu Xu Lane and demanded protection money. They were refused. Unwilling to accept this, the ruffians lingered outside the door. The opium den then sent out more than ten people, dragged the ruffians to the Tianfulou teahouse, and severely beat them. The four ruffians all suffered serious injuries. Later, through mediation, they were given compensation for their injuries, and the matter was settled. Shao Heng, a detective from the Water Police, was demoted. The other day, in Fengqiao Town, three li from the city, he caught an opium trafficker named Zhang Yingqing (also known as Zhang Aqi) and seized 116 taels and three qian of opium. He immediately escorted him to the Second District of the Public Security Bureau in Mu. Zhang confessed in the district department that he had bought the opium from the Guo Baofeng opium den. Thereupon, District Chief Lou dispatched a large number of detectives, together with the land police, to search the Guo Baofeng opium den. Because the opium den had heard of the search in advance, they moved the evidence elsewhere, so nothing was found at the time. Only one associate of the opium den, Huang Zhongyi, was apprehended and taken to the district, where Zhang Rongqing identified him. Section Chief Feng interrogated him and ordered him to be detained. He will be sent to the court for interrogation today. The Wang Public Security Bureau believes that the police officer in charge and the branch chief are suspected of colluding and shielding the opium den and has decided to investigate.</p>

<p>The Wu County Public Security Bureau is in arrears with police wages for five months, totaling over 90,000 yuan. Recently, on August 1st, a new system was implemented, and the laid-off police officers urgently need to be paid their back wages for severance. Thereupon, Director Wang submitted a request to the county government to find ways to raise funds. Yesterday, County Magistrate Wu invited Chairman Shi of the County Chamber of Commerce to the government to discuss the matter. As a result, it was decided that the County Chamber of Commerce would invite the leaders of the banking, money exchange, and land industries to discuss borrowing 66,000 yuan, using the land tax for the 23rd year as collateral, with a term of six months and a monthly interest rate of 1.2%.</p>

<p>The county government previously received a joint petition from Hua Lunxiang and others, the township chiefs of Zhoujing and other lower-level townships in the Second District, to dredge the railway bridge at No. 149 Zhoujing Lane to facilitate irrigation. After receiving the petition, County Magistrate Yan sent a letter to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations to discuss the matter. After the letter was sent, it was reported that the Engineering Department had been ordered to instruct the Dan-Su Section Chief to find a way to dredge the channel. According to the report, excavating the bottom of the bridge, which is entirely made of cement, would endanger traffic safety, but in order to protect farmland water conservancy, a six-foot-wide water channel will be excavated in the middle of the bridge bottom, which will not endanger the bridge piers, and the water flow will be unobstructed. After receiving the letter, the county government has ordered District Chief Yuan Yongshang of the Second District to inform the township chiefs.</p>

<p>Since Cheng and Xi counties jointly worked on drought relief and opened up key passages connecting rivers and lakes, the water volume in the inner rivers has increased, benefiting a large number of farmers. It is learned that Jiangyin has already installed 50-horsepower engines at Huangtiangang and Huangshangang to pump river water into the inner rivers, and seven 24-horsepower engines are distributed in the inner rivers to receive the water, resulting in significant results. At the point where the rivers and lakes diverge, which is located at the Si River Estuary, the river tide has now reached the south of Shichuang, only three or four li away from Baitang. Since Wangting, Shadungang, and Jinsha Lock in Wuxi were opened, the water volume in the inner rivers has greatly increased, and farmland can now be irrigated. Yesterday, the Chenghsi Drought Relief Committee dispatched Zhang Lanqing to conduct an on-site survey along the canal. It has been measured that the water volume at Baitangwei and Gaoqiao is 3.5 feet, while at the northern part of Gaoqiao, a place called Vortex Water, it is 6.5 feet.</p>

<p>After Luo Wengan, Minister of Justice, inspected the judicial detention centers in Su, Chang, and Xi counties, he realized that the detention centers were overcrowded, and due to the extreme heat this summer, the hygiene of the detainees was bound to be greatly affected. He ordered the counties to find ways to relieve the situation and specially dispatched commissioners Li Zhaoming, together with Prosecutor Zhu Jun of the High Court, to the counties to handle the matter. Commissioners Li and Zhu arrived in Changzhou from Xi yesterday (2nd) and stayed at the Dacheng Hotel.

Upon inspection, he found hemp sacks wrapped around the outside, and inside were two white cloth bags of crushed wheat. The sacks were sealed and taken to the bureau, where Director Xu personally inspected them one by one in public. There were thirteen bags in total, each containing forty cakes, weighing approximately 660 taels in total. Two opium traffickers, Xu Zhigui and Wang Guofu, and a cart driver, Cui Daji, were arrested on the spot. After interrogation, they confessed to selling opium. Director Xu tightly sealed the seized items and sent them to the General Bureau for verification.</p>

He went to Geneva in April with An Fuguo, the labor representative, and Wang Zhisheng, the capital representative. At the opening of the conference, he gave a detailed account of the labor administration situation in China and the recent efforts to promote the Factory Law, which received the goodwill and support of the member states of the League of Nations. Therefore, he was elected with 60 votes in this re-election of the council. Since China joined the League of Nations in 1919, representatives from previous sessions have made considerable efforts to be elected to the council, but due to the difficulty of gaining sympathy from the member states, they have never been elected. This election is not only of great expectation for the future promotion of labor administration in China but also has earned considerable honor in improving the international status. After inspecting factory inspections in Britain and France, Representative Li returned to China on the Conte Verde from Venice on the 11th of last month and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 10:30 am today (4th). It is now heard that the labor circles in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Wuhan have sent telegrams to express their congratulations. When Representative Li returns to China, there will be a grand welcome meeting. Various groups in this city, including the National Federation of Commerce, the Chinese Seven Industries Federation, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Mechanical Federation, and the General Labor Union, will send representatives to the New Customs Wharf to welcome the representatives to the International Labor Conference.

<p>To Protect Depositors' Interests</p>
<p>Deeply Feeling Impeded and Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, after the promulgation of the Savings Bank Law, the Banking Association contributed opinions, requesting the government to adopt them, and presented the difficulties of implementation to the Minister of Finance. Now that all banks have been ordered to implement it, the association held a meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday specifically to discuss the Savings Bank Law and resolved to petition the government to amend it. Attendees at yesterday's meeting included Chen Guangfu, Song ZiLiang, Jing Runyou, Wu Yunzhai, Le Gengrong, Hu Bijiang, Tang Shoumin, Ye Fuxiao, Luo Qinghua, Chen Zheqing, Chen Shizhen, Wang Zhixin, Zhu Zikui, Sun Jingxi, Wang Boyuan, Qi Yunqing, Hu Xi'an, Liu Huizhi, Xu Boming, Wu Weiru, etc. The Secretary-General, Lin Kanghou, was also present. Chen Guangfu chaired the meeting, reporting on the members' compliance with Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law as ordered by the Ministry of Finance, and the process of presenting requests for amendments to Minister Kong. The discussion then began on (1) Article 7 (Original): Savings banks, when conducting the business stipulated in Article 9, shall not use their funds except in the following ways: (1) Purchasing government bonds, treasury bills, and other secured securities approved by the Ministry of Finance; (2) Lending with government bonds, treasury bills, and other secured securities approved by the Ministry of Finance as collateral; (3) Lending with real estate that has continuous and reliable income as mortgage; (4) Lending with fixed deposit certificates or passbooks from other banks as collateral; (5) Purchasing bills accepted by other banks; (6) Depositing in other banks; (7) Secured lending to rural cooperatives; (8) Lending with agricultural products as collateral. (2) Article 8 (Original): The total amount of securities issued by the same company held by a savings bank, as specified in Article 7, Clauses 1 and 2, shall not exceed one-tenth of the company's paid-up capital and reserve fund. The total amount of loans from a savings bank, as specified in Article 7, Clause 3, shall not exceed one-fifth of its total deposits. The total amount of loans from a savings bank, as specified in Article 7, Clause 4, shall not exceed one-fifteenth of its total deposits. The amount of bills purchased by a savings bank, as specified in Article 7, Clause 5, shall not exceed one-twentieth of its total deposits. The amount of deposits from a savings bank, as specified in Article 7, Clause 6, shall not exceed one-fifteenth of its total deposits, except for those with government bonds, treasury bills, and other secured securities approved by the Ministry of Finance as collateral. When ordinary banks concurrently operate savings bank business, the provisions of the preceding two paragraphs shall apply mutatis mutandis to the amount of bills accepted by the bank department for the savings department and the amount deposited. The total amount of loans from a savings bank, as specified in Article 7, Clauses 7 and 8, shall not be less than one-fifth of the total deposits. It was resolved that Articles 7 and 8 above, for the sake of protecting depositors' interests, are in fact impeded and difficult to implement, and a request should be submitted to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Ministry of Finance to request amendments, including restrictions on the composition of use and funds. The telegram will be sent after review, and a committee will be appointed to review it. (3) Article 9 (Original): Savings banks should deposit at least one-quarter of their total savings deposits in the specially established vault of the Central Bank, as collateral for the repayment of savings deposits, in the form of government bonds, treasury bills, and other secured assets. All banks have now been ordered to comply with Article 9 and deposit one-quarter of their total deposits in government bonds and treasury bills with the Central Bank. It was resolved that, when requesting amendments to the entire Savings Bank Law, the provisions of Article 9 should be presented to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Ministry of Finance for a temporary delay in implementation. The meeting adjourned at 4 PM. The telegram was sent out last night. It is planned to use hundreds of acres as a factory base and three hundred acres to build a model village so that overseas compatriots can return to the country to live and work. Now, the General Manager of the factory, Mr. Huang Hongjun, under the urging of overseas Chinese, is scheduled to set sail today with his wife,</p>

<h3 id="e115">Flour Prices Rise Daily <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Large Quantities of American Flour for Sale</p>
<p>Market Price Still Difficult to Stabilize</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, recently, all sectors have paid close attention to the soaring rice prices. According to news from the grain industry, recently, the rising trend of flour prices has been even greater than that of rice prices. The reason for the sharp rise is not only that most wheat-producing areas in North China have suffered from water damage, resulting in a hopeless harvest, but also that other wheat-producing countries have also had poor harvests this year. However, flour is the main food source in North China, so the demand in the flour market in this city is extremely strong. Recently, more than one million bags have been sold to the Northeast and Tianjin. The government sold 400,000 bags of American flour yesterday at a price of 2.5 yuan, but the market price is still difficult to stabilize. The minimum price of wheat was 2.7 yuan, but it has recently risen to 4 yuan and continues to rise. According to the current situation, flour market prices may continue to rise without decline.</p>

<p>The Binjiang flood disaster this time is extremely severe, even more so than in previous years. The Shanghai General Office of the Southeast Main Branch of the World Red Swastika Society received a report yesterday from the Binjiang Red Swastika Society detailing the situation of the flood disaster. We are recording it here to inform all sectors, so that they know that our compatriots outside the customs are indeed in deep water and fire every day.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, Binjiang has been experiencing continuous rainfall, and the water level of the Songhua River has been rising daily, causing widespread anxiety and fear. The association immediately established a flood relief supervision department and converted the second relief team to work on the Public Concession for the Rickshaw Problem.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Yesterday Another Meeting of Rickshaw Merchants Was Convened <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Because Macey Would Not Concede to Postpone for Further Discussion</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Formed a Special Committee That Held Its First Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Industry Association of the Special District of this city, dissatisfied with the Public Concession Bureau of Works and the Vehicle Affairs Committee's refusal to issue vehicle licenses and the promulgation of new regulations, which led to disputes, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Public Concession Bureau of Works separately convened rickshaw merchants for discussions yesterday. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Macey Firmly Refused <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The rickshaw merchants of the Special District, regarding the new regulations, sent representatives to negotiate with the Public Concession Bureau of Works several times. As a result, both parties decided to form a committee to study and improve, specializing in discussing rickshaw rentals and revising regulations. At 3 PM yesterday, the Public Concession Bureau of Works held another meeting with rickshaw merchants at the Bureau. Representatives from the association, Yin Zhiling, Hou Shaoan, Ma Saisi, Pei Er, etc., were present. Those attending from the Public Concession Bureau of Works included General Manager Zhong Si, Police Superintendent Qiu Lai, Deputy Superintendent Maideng, Vehicle Committee Chairman Macey, Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, and Office Manager He Dekui. The rickshaw merchants first presented the situation. All representatives expressed acceptance. Regarding the rickshaw rental issue in the new regulations, rickshaw merchants currently only collect 8 jiao, which is still less than the 1 jiao stipulated by the Public Concession Bureau of Works. In addition, there are leasing expenses for the contractors. Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing believed that the proposals made by the rickshaw merchants were reasonable, but Vehicle Committee Chairman Macey insisted on the already promulgated new regulations, saying there was no room for change. Therefore, discussions continued until 6 PM without any progress. It was decided to reschedule the meeting for Monday morning next week for further discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e120">No Miscellaneous Grains Shipped to Shanghai <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Gu Sheng Yi's Talk</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, recently there has been much public talk about the grain industry in this city purchasing large quantities of foreign rice, and that the Japanese are shipping large quantities of miscellaneous grains from the Northeast to the grain industry in this city. The Central News Agency reporter specially inquired about this matter with Gu Xinyi, a giant in the grain industry, who said the following:</p>
<h3 id="e121">A Batch of Saigon Rice Has Arrived in Shanghai <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Gu, the rice industry in this city did indeed order Saigon rice from Siamese rice merchants, and one thousand bags have already arrived in Shanghai. As for the report that the Local Coordination Association ordered more than 4,000 tons of Saigon rice, there is a slight misunderstanding. The Saigon rice was not ordered in the name of the Local Coordination Association, but by gentlemen from the banking industry and other industries in this city in their private capacity. It has not yet been shipped. After it arrives, it will not be sold immediately, but will be sold at a fair price next spring if rice prices soar. As for He Defu, a Siamese overseas Chinese rice merchant, he met with me and is currently in Shanghai. He is in the country to investigate rice prices, so the rice industry in this city has not traded with Mr. He. If domestic rice prices continue to rise in the future, Mr. He has agreed to ship Saigon rice back to the country to help regulate them.</p>
<h3 id="e122">No Miscellaneous Grains Shipped to Shanghai by the Japanese Side <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the rumor that the Japanese side recently shipped a large quantity of miscellaneous grains to Shanghai for sale, Mr. Gu replied that this statement is indeed unfounded. The Northeast originally produced soybeans and red sorghum as its main products, but according to current market prices, the price of soybeans produced in the Northeast is more than 4 yuan per dan, and the price of red sorghum is nearly 3 yuan per dan, which are both more expensive than domestic prices. Soybeans are produced in Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces. The price of soybeans shipped from these provinces to Shanghai for sale is 3.4 yuan, which is about 1 yuan lower than the price of soybeans from the Northeast. Therefore, soybeans from the Northeast have not been shipped to Shanghai for sale for a long time. Moreover, the various miscellaneous grains produced domestically are currently sufficient for use, so there is no need for assistance from foreign miscellaneous grains. Grain merchants have also decided to prioritize the sale of domestic products, so this statement is indeed unfounded.</p>

<p>Merchant Shipping, People's Livelihood Alliance Founded</p>
<h3 id="e124">Joint Sea-River Shipping Cooperation <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Eighteen Articles of the Contract Have Been Signed</p>
<p>The Implementation Period Has Been Agreed to Be Six Months</p>
<p>Since the dissolution of the alliance of seven companies on April 1 for the Chuanshan River shipping industry, the companies have reduced shipping rates and competed for cargo. Up to now, the cotton yarn item has fallen to two yuan per piece, which is only one-tenth of the original rate. Other goods have also been reduced in price uniformly, causing no Chuanshan River shipping to be free from losses. Currently, Minsheng Company has the largest influence on the Chuanshan River shipping. The Chinese merchant ships on the Huiyi route have mostly been incorporated into Minsheng. In order to develop the business of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and to transport goods from various coastal ports, the company's general manager, Lu Zuofu, personally came to Shanghai to negotiate with the China Merchants Bureau on joint sea-river shipping cooperation. After a long period of discussion, eighteen articles have been decided, which have been signed by the authorities of both parties and will be implemented immediately. Details are urgently reported as follows:</p>
<p>Cooperation Motivation: Minsheng Company has been buying more and more ships in recent years, and has secured the first position in shipping in the Chuanshan River. However, most of the ships operate between Chongqing and Yichang, followed by ships directly from Chongqing to Shanghai. In terms of business, the upstream occupies a superior position, while the downstream lacks docks and warehouses, so it cannot be fully developed. For this problem, the company has contacted various shipping companies in Shanghai for a long time, but without success. Since the state-owned China Merchants Bureau suffered an accident with the Emei ship, the upper Yangtze River shipping has suddenly felt a lack of ships, and Lu Zuofu, the general manager of Minsheng, contacted the bureau to cooperate with Yangtze River shipping, and agreed on joint sea-river shipping methods with the China Merchants Bureau. Both parties consulted for a long time before success.</p>
<p>Signing the Contract: The joint sea-river shipping and Yangtze River cooperation business of the two companies, under the meeting of both parties, signed a contract, a total of eighteen articles, agreed by Liu Hongsheng and Lu Zuofu. After many revisions, the formal draft was finalized on July 31. The China Merchants Bureau submitted it to the board of directors for approval. Lu Zuofu in Shanghai on the Minsheng side can be responsible for signing. Details of the cooperation and joint transportation between the two companies are still being drawn up. The joint transportation will start this month and will be valid for six months. If the results are excellent, it can be extended again.</p>
<p>Joint Method: The contract stipulates that from Chongqing to Hankou, and from Yuezhou, Changsha, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to Shanghai, and the two north and south sea routes, a total of twenty-one wheel ports of the joint river and sea shipping areas, Minsheng Company supplies the China Merchants Bureau with transportation warehouses and other items in the Yiwanyi section of Chongqing, and stipulates that Minsheng will not add ships to the Changjiang Road in Xiang'e Road, and the China Merchants Bureau will not add shifts in the Yiwanyi Line of Chongqing. The China Merchants Bureau's North and South Ocean wheels load joint transport cargo for Minsheng. The China Merchants Bureau's transfer cargo to Sichuan is also transported by Minsheng wheels. The goods shipped out of Chongqing and Yiwanyi are returned to the Minsheng bill of lading, and the goods entering Sichuan in Shanghai are signed and issued by the China Merchants Bureau.</p>
<p>Immediate Implementation: After the two parties finalized the contract, they discussed implementation. Minsheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Sichuan and has changed to mooring at the North Warehouse Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, and the loading and unloading of goods and passengers is quite convenient. The China Merchants Bureau Chuanshan River, although there is no boat line now, can also carry passengers and goods, and can be transported on behalf of Minsheng boats. The Minsheng Company's National Wheel, which exported today, has started to jointly transport Wanxian Chongqing goods. The China Merchants Bureau, due to the success of Chuanshan River cooperation, its long-stalled China Merchants Chongqing Customs Office, Hengtai will be responsible for handling it.</p>
<p>Jinting Guildhall</p>
<h3 id="e125">Automatically Reduce Rent <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>90% off on Daxing Street, 95% off on Lujiabang</p>
<p>A Special Letter Was Sent Yesterday to the Rent Reduction Committee for Reference</p>
<p>The thirty-five municipal houses on Daxing Street and Lujiabang outside the Xiaoximen of this city are the property of the Jinting Guildhall. It is now known that the Guildhall, in view of the sluggish market, in order to reduce the burden on citizens, has automatically reduced the rent of the above houses. A special letter was sent yesterday to the Rent Reduction Committee of this city for reference. The original letter is as follows: Respected Sirs, The market in Shanghai has been sluggish in recent years, and the people's economy has been extremely depressed. The problem of residence is especially important to the people's livelihood. In this recession, it is considered the heaviest burden for all citizens, because it is difficult to live even in a small place with a high price. This board of directors knows and understands the hardships of this situation, so it specially reduced the rent of all thirty-five municipal houses on Daxing Street and Lujiabang Road outside the Xiaoximen of this guildhall, in line with the trend, and initiated automatic rent reduction. It is calculated that 90% will be charged along Daxing Street, and 95% will be charged along Lujiabang Road, to increase the feelings of the customers and landlords, reduce the burden of the tenants, and create the first rent reduction movement in Nanshi, so that all landlords can hear the news and follow suit. Although the construction costs of this guildhall came from loans, and the monthly rental income had long been budgeted for distribution, in order to implement the above-mentioned purpose, it did not hesitate to painfully sacrifice and contacted the creditors several times for relief, fortunately with their approval. In addition to printing and distributing the rent reduction measures to the tenants, a corresponding letter is sent to your committee for reference and sympathy, etc.</p>

<p>Sharing by Shares vs. Joint Liability</p>
<p>Clear Advantages and Disadvantages, Please Chamber of Commerce Strive</p>
<p>The local Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association, Bean and Rice Industry Association, etc., yesterday, due to the Legislative Yuan's Commercial Law Committee sending Huang Youchang as a member to Shanghai to investigate the commercial registration law of the grain and bean rice industry, notified by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to express opinions as much as possible, the associations specially sent a detailed letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce regarding the reasons for partnership business and sharing by shares. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, Previously, Article 681 of our country's current civil law, regarding joint liability for partnership debts, greatly conflicted with our country's inherent commercial customs. Our association, etc., based on legal principles and citing partnership regulations from the civil laws of Germany, France, Switzerland, and Japan, petitioned your esteemed association to forward it to the Legislative Yuan for modification. As a result, the remedy for partnership organizations, sharing by shares, can be remedied by separately establishing commercial registration. The Civil and Commercial Law Committee is drafting the regulations. Now, We received a notice from your esteemed association that the Commercial Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan stated in a letter that our committee is currently drafting a commercial registration law and needs to investigate the commercial situation in various places for reference. Huang Youchang has been dispatched to Shanghai for investigation. In addition to copying and sending the opinions of various industries regarding the case of sharing responsibility for partnerships for reference, what opinions do you have regarding the commercial registration law? Please express them as much as possible in a letter and forward them to our committee for review and submission. According to this, our association has already fully stated the reasons for sharing by shares in partnerships last year, referring to the legal reasons of various countries, with our association taking the lead, together with various industry associations, and refuted the opinions advocated by accountant Pan Xulun. The esteemed association forwarded it to the Legislative Yuan for submission to the Civil and Commercial Law Committees. After repeated discussions, a separate commercial registration law was finally established to carry out remedies. Now, the Legislative Yuan is about to draft the commercial registration law and has first sent Huang Youchang to Shanghai for investigation and to solicit opinions from our association, etc., showing that the Legislative Yuan respects public opinion and is considerate of commercial conditions, and that your esteemed association can extensively consult and follow the will and customs of various groups. In addition to requesting your esteemed association to still copy and send the reasons stated last year for reference, now the association will again open up opinions on the reasons for sharing by shares in partnership business in substantive law and procedural law, requesting your esteemed association to grant adoption and forward them on our behalf, for which we will be infinitely grateful: (1) Article 681 of the current civil law, regarding partnership contracts, should be changed to sharing by shares. In addition to already clearly stating the convenience based on the laws of various European and Asian countries last year, now our association believes that the partnership business in our country should be shared by shares, and there are still old laws in our country that can be cited as evidence. When the Law Compilation Institute of the former Qing Dynasty compiled the draft of the civil law, although the purpose of the legislation at that time and the general meaning of compiling the general rules of the civil law, real rights, and creditor's rights, the first three compilations, were quite different from the principles of the current civil and commercial laws combined, the partnership business still fell within the scope of the contract in the second chapter of the first compilation of the draft. Article 797 of the draft civil law of the former Qing Dynasty stated that if there is no special agreement among the partners, the joint investment must be equally divided. Also, Article 809 of the same draft stated that if the percentage of profit and loss distribution among the partners is not agreed upon, regardless of the type and amount of investment, it shall be equally divided. Also, Article 828 of the same draft stated that if the partnership property is not sufficient to repay the partnership debts and the investment of each partner, each partner must bear the insufficient amount according to the percentage of loss distribution. According to this, the draft civil law only stipulated equal division of all loss sharing for partnership business and did not explicitly state joint liability. The draft has never been formally implemented and promulgated, but the precedents and interpretations of the Supreme Court at that time, Although this draft has never been recognized as a formally effective law, it is not without some precedents for the adoption of the academic theory and the consideration of the regulations. All those who study law and those in the legal profession deeply understand this purpose. The reason for this provision at that time was to follow the inherent customs of our country and to slightly imitate the spirit of the German legal system. From this example, it can be seen that the sharing of partnership debts by shares has precedents in our country's legislation for reference. The reason why our association jointly petitioned last year was not without basis. Up to this point, it cannot be supplemented again. This is the first point. (2) From the perspective of procedural law for legislation, commercial registration belonged to commercial registration during the era of the Beijing government. The legislation of the Beijing government was originally based on the precedents compiled by the Law Compilation Institute of the former Qing Dynasty, separating the civil and commercial laws. Therefore, Regarding Commercial Registration (i.e., commercial registration), the third chapter of the Merchants' General Provisions, which was promulgated by the former Beijing government on March 2, 1914, and implemented on September 1 of the same year, already had detailed regulations. After the establishment of the National Government, this code of law did not conflict with the Party's laws and regulations, so it could still be used. Although there were very few legal provisions for commercial registration in the Merchants' General Provisions, there were clear regulations that each merchant should report registration to the relevant government office in the location of its business. Now, although the Legislative Yuan has combined the civil and commercial laws into one compilation in legislation, the legislation on commercial registration is still like the various parts of the Company Law, Insurance Law, Negotiable Instruments Law, and Maritime Law, and they must still be kept independent. The importance of the commercial registration law can be seen from this article. Moreover, Shanghai is the center of national commerce and the hub of trade with foreign countries. Commercial registration is extremely important. Moreover, partnership business in commerce, except for merchants with independent capital and company organizations, all belong to partnership business. Its importance in commerce is self-evident. Moreover, the term 'relevant government office in the location of the business' for the registration agency is somewhat vague. Instead, merchants in partnership business should first request registration from the city or county chamber of commerce in the location of the business, and then the chamber of commerce should report it to the local judicial authority and the central administrative agency on a monthly or quarterly basis for careful recording. In the current chamber of commerce system, the chamber of commerce is the general assembly of commercial groups. The so-called commercial groups are molecular organizations formed by the local trade associations. Therefore, in the future, all commercial registration should first be reported by each Merchant to its trade association, then the trade association should report to the county and city chamber of commerce, and then the county and city chamber of commerce should report to the local judicial authority and the local and central administrative agencies (i.e., the Ministry of Industry) on a monthly or quarterly basis. The county and city chambers of commerce, in addition to reporting according to law, should also make public announcements in their official gazettes for promulgating regulations on a monthly or quarterly basis. In this way, the parts are classified and clearly listed. Regardless of the capital of the partnership, the names of the partners, and the brand and address of the partnership business, there is reliable evidence for reference. If the partnership business fails and the partnership property is insufficient to pay off the debtors, each partner should naturally share the damaged debt amount on a pro rata basis, not only allowing creditors to know the actual situation of the partnership business at any time and place, but also each partner will have no excuse to shirk the obligations they bear, and there is no need for further investigation or evidence when the judicial authority makes a judgment. This is what is legally called being able to resist bona fide third parties because of registration (i.e., creditors). On the contrary, if a partnership business is not registered in accordance with current laws, and the partnership business fails and the partnership property is insufficient to pay off the debts, regardless of the amount and value of the investment of the partnership, any creditor can demand joint and several liability from any investor in the partnership, regardless of the total amount of their shares. This is what is called not being able to resist bona fide third parties because of non-registration (i.e., creditors). If the provisions of Article 681 of the current Civil Code are applied to this, it can be said that there is absolutely no doubt.</p>
<p>Based on the above discussion, in terms of substantive laws and regulations, the history of joint liability and pro rata sharing of partnership businesses in our country's legislation is not without consideration. In terms of continuing laws and regulations, the commercial registration law, if strictly formulated according to the above procedures, is to protect the safety of commerce and the consolidation of creditor's rights. Regardless of whether the current legislative purpose is to protect creditor's rights or protect debtor's rights, it is necessary to enforce compulsory registration and encourage the implementation of contract laws and regulations. Even if partnership businesses do not request registration, they should be subject to Appropriate penalties will prevent future partnership organizations from being frightened by the provisions of Article 681 of the Civil Code and seek dissolution, as today's commerce is unstable. On the positive side, precisely because of this Civil Code Article 68, and the enactment of mandatory regulations for commercial registration, it can safely engage in legitimate commerce, so that its business can be consolidated and its credit can be long-term. Progress, We, the association, respectfully present our humble opinions in two respects. We respectfully request that your esteemed association forward them to the members of the Legislative Yuan for adoption, for which we will be infinitely grateful. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Municipal Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association, Shanghai Municipal Head Rice Industry Association."</p>

<p>Municipal Government Responds to Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3 id="e131">Land Transfer Fees Difficult to Reduce <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously presented a petition to the Municipal Government based on the resolutions of the Fifth General Assembly of Members, requesting that the tax rate for real estate transfer taxes levied by the city be reduced to 3.6%, in order to reduce the burden on citizens. Now, it has received a reply from the Municipal Government stating: "Received your presentation and instructed the Land Bureau to reply. The Land Bureau replied that real estate transfers within the city area that have not undergone the exchange of land permits will be subject to a 1% handling fee at the time of contract signing, previously called municipal expenses, and 5% was paid. Later, in order to reduce the burden on owners, it was requested to change it to a 1% handling fee and a land guarantee stamp fee. After the land certificate is exchanged, all transfers only require an 8% transfer tax, which is 8.4%, which is slightly lower than the contract signing. Within the land value tax area, it is reduced to 2.1%. In the future, after the land value tax is widespread, this transfer tax will also be reduced accordingly. Furthermore, the transfer tax rate in this city is nominally higher than 6.3%, but in terms of the same contract transfer, for example, in Baoshan County, which is adjacent to this city, all real estate transfers must pay an autonomous fee of 8% of the contract value, plus a 6% contract tax, totaling 14%. In addition, there are special construction donations and fundraising expenses, which are not included. Now, in this city, the 8% tax payment includes all transfer fees and the 1% handling fee, totaling only 9%. The burden is already significantly different. Since this city started levying land value tax, this income has been greatly reduced. If the transfer tax in areas where land value tax has not been levied is reduced to 6.3%, tax revenue will be even more reduced. After receiving the order, a bureau affairs meeting was convened for detailed discussion. It was generally believed that the land transfer in the temporary land value tax area of this city is subject to a 2% transfer tax, which is lower than the 6.3% method decided by the financial meeting. Therefore, the chamber of commerce's request to reduce the tax rate is difficult to handle, and it is intended to continue to handle the transfer tax rate according to the old regulations. In addition to ordering that it be handled according to the established regulations, it is hereby notified for your information." This is the reply.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Replacement of Comprador Dispute Resolved <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Negotiation Results from Union Introduction</p>
<p>Xu, the comprador of the Nanhua class Yusheng ship of Jardine Matheson, passed away due to illness, and a Mr. Feng was appointed by the Hong Kong head office to take over. Unexpectedly, after Mr. Feng took over, he brought 30 workers from Hong Kong, intending to replace all the original cargo handling workers on the ship, which caused a dispute. This case has been going on for a month. Initially, the Jardine Matheson Club negotiated without success. Later, it was submitted to the Chinese Seamen's Union for handling. Secretary Sun Luping was dispatched to negotiate directly with the company. Mr. Tudor, the general manager of the company, respects the union and has no objection, but due to long-standing practices, the cargo handling workers have always been hired by the comprador, so it is not convenient to interfere. Later, in order to take care of the livelihoods of the workers, the union was allowed to introduce candidates for the position of comprador on the ship, or directly appoint a worker to fill the position. As for the deposit, due to the union's involvement, the original amount of 5,000 yuan is now only 2,000 yuan, which will allow the company to dismiss the newly appointed comprador Feng to resolve the dispute. Otherwise, the comprador has the right to hire workers, and the company has no way to guarantee it. It is now known that the union has introduced Shi Yonggao, the comprador of the ship, to be promoted to comprador based on the wishes of the workers. All cargo handling workers continue to work as usual, and the contract was finalized yesterday. All 30 workers brought by Mr. Feng left the ship that day. According to the union's introduction, the comprador has always been the company's used Shan gong. This has never been seen before. This move has created a new record in the shipping industry and has set a precedent for breaking the contracting system.</p>

<p>Attached to Jingzhou Road Elementary School</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Public Concession, in response to the request of the Education Committee, decided to open a night school in Jingzhou Road Elementary School in the fall of this year to enroll boys aged 14 to 20, and allocate funds not exceeding 2,000 yuan for trial purposes. This proposal was originally a recommendation from a subcommittee of the Education Committee, which planned to open two night schools this fall. According to the Chief of Finance, the opening of night schools is not within the current education program of the Board of Directors. Its establishment is beneficial to Chinese residents, but there is no such preparation in this year's budget. Its opening is not an urgent need, and it seems that the budget can be considered again when planning the budget for 1935. The Education Committee then decided to request the Board of Directors to approve the opening of one school this year for trial purposes. As for the funding, there is still 2,000 yuan of unused funds in the subsidy for Chinese schools, which can be used for payment. The Board of Directors then approved it.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Gasoline Prices Rise Again <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Rises Up to Five Corners Per Ten Gallons</p>
<p>Kerosene Imports Soar</p>
<p>Since the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia agreed to stop competing and selling in order to recover previous losses, kerosene prices in our country's kerosene market have been rising. Recently, prices have been increased uniformly, and each country is trying its best to export and dump excess kerosene to China. As a result, the import volume in June of this year has increased sharply. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Gasoline Prices Rise According to people in the gasoline industry, since the four major petroleum companies, Asia, Mobil, Texaco, and Oil Land, agreed to raise prices, prices have gradually increased. A month ago, the price per ten gallons was still 8.1 yuan, but the original price in this month was far less than the cost. In order to maintain business, it was decided to increase it by another five corners. The current price per ten gallons is 8.6 yuan, an increase of half a yuan. In the future, it is planned to continue to increase within a possible range.</p>
<p>Kerosene Imports Soar According to customs reports, the import volume of kerosene in my country in June of this year has increased sharply again. The imports from British North Borneo were 76 liters, worth the gold unit. Japan imported 303 liters, worth 27 gold units. The Dutch East Indies imported 7,139,652 liters, worth 297,995 gold units. The United States imported 2,922,22 liters, worth 140,687 gold units. The Soviet Union imported 12,526,618 liters from European ports, worth 501,065 gold units. Other countries imported 1,177 liters, worth 190 gold units. Excluding the number of foreign destinations, the total is 21,920,708 liters, worth 885,330 gold units, an increase of 19,689,309 liters over the import volume in May, an increase of 749,305 gold units in value.</p>

The first batch has been loaded by the Dalai ship to Yokohama for delivery. The second, third, and fourth batches will be loaded by Zhongxing ships and Hua Wu ships one after another and will all be delivered to Yokohama.</p>

<p>Dozens of People Homeless</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Will Provide Relief</p>
<p>The house of Ci Liu, a woman from Taixing, No. 19 Diandang Lane, behind Yangjiadu Street in Pudong, suddenly caught fire at about 12:30 yesterday afternoon. The fire broke through the roof immediately. At that time, the sun was scorching and the weather was extremely hot, and the fire became more intense. Ci Liu was panicked because her husband was working outside. Yang Chang, who learned about the fire from the First Branch of the Third District, immediately ordered Second Patrolman Sun Bu and Police Chief Dai to lead the police to suppress the fire. The police first used wooden buckets to draw water from nearby to put out the fire. Soon, the Pudong Fire Brigade also drove to the scene. At the same time, Yuanyi Stack in the west and Yingchang Factory in the north also drove pump cars to help. Because the distance from the Yangtze River was far, they could only rely on the well in the nearby goldfish pond and the dyeing workshop for water supply, so it was difficult to put out the fire for a while. After burning for about half an hour, it spread to three neighboring houses, and the front and back of a small restaurant opened by Chen, a woman from Jiangbei, No. 220 Yangjiadu Street behind. At this time, the firefighters worked hard to put out the fire and gradually extinguished it, and it did not spread further. In total, seven bungalows were destroyed. In addition to the small restaurant occupying three rooms, there were four other rooms, inhabited by ten households, all poor people from other provinces, with dozens of people of all ages. They were homeless and in a very pitiful state. After the fire was extinguished, the police at the post took Ci Liu, who started the fire, to the police station. She claimed that she was out to buy soap when the fire started, and it was probably caused by the fire not being extinguished after the meal. Director Yang ordered her to be sent to the bureau for punishment, and also asked the headquarters to find ways to help the victims of the fire.</p>
<p>Robbery on Shanhai Pass Road</p>
<h3 id="e142">Police Arrest a Bandit <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Bandit Fired Guns and Fled</p>
<p>Finally Shot Down and Captured</p>
<p>At about 5:00 p.m. yesterday, six bandits suddenly came to a certain tobacco shop at No. 560, the intersection of Shanhai Pass Road and Datong Road. They were wearing black and white short shirts and pants, and two of them were hiding pistols. One bandit was guarding outside, and the rest of the bandits broke into the shop and shouted at the shop owner, shop assistant, and apprentice, forbidding them to make a sound. They forced them to hand over the key to the money cabinet, opened the cabinet, and robbed all the cash and foreign currency worth about 130 yuan stored inside. When the bandits saw that their goal had been achieved, they hurried out to escape. Before long after the bandits left the door, the shop assistant also followed out. The bandits did not notice and followed all the way until the intersection of Meibaige Road and Baike Road. The shop assistant saw the bandits were dividing the spoils and trying to flee in all directions, so he urgently reported to the police at the post and led them to identify and arrest the bandits. Unexpectedly, the bandits were discovered, and when the police arrived, they had fled in all directions. One of the bandits continued to flee along Baike Road. The police blew their whistles and bravely chased after him. The bandit was in a hurry and fired a gun at the police. The police also fired back. The bandit fought and fled until he reached the entrance of the Baolong Hospital, where he was finally shot down by the police and his pistol was seized. The police immediately reported to the Xinzha police station by telephone and sent a car to take the bandit to the Public Concession Hospital. At the same time, they chased and arrested the other fugitives and will investigate the case and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Illegitimate Son Does Not Engage in Honest Work</p>
<h3 id="e143">Threatening Letter to Foster Father <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Demanding 50 Yuan with a Deadline for Payment</p>
<p>Foster Father Reports to Police, Who Order a Warrant</p>
<p>Sun Xiechun Niugudian (牛骨店 - Ox Bone Shop) at No. 88 Baodai Lane, Xiaodongmen, is owned by Sun Maotang, a native of Ningbo, and has been in business for over 30 years. In 1919, Sun, through a friend's introduction, adopted a five-month-old child, naming him Sun Derong (also known as Defu), who is now 22 years old. Later, Sun's wife also gave birth to two sons, aged 12 and 7. The family of five, including his wife, all reside in the shop, relying entirely on business income. They live frugally and are able to maintain a warm and adequately fed life. He once instructed his adopted son, Derong, to learn a trade at a machinery factory and even helped him get married. Unexpectedly, this adopted son does not engage in honest work, but willingly sinks into degradation. Despite his foster father's repeated admonitions, his bad habits are deeply ingrained, and he consistently refuses to change. Recently, he even secretly engraved a seal, defrauding various places of goods to convert them into cash for his use. Not content with this, he also sent threatening letters to Sun's relatives, demanding money and spending it like water. A few days ago, he had another fantastic idea. He sent a letter through the post office to his foster father, Sun Maotang, with threatening content, demanding 50 yuan and setting a three-day deadline to deliver the money to the tea room outside the third-floor hall of the Dongfang Hotel in Xiaodongmen. Otherwise, it said, unexpected things would happen. After receiving the letter, Sun felt that his adopted son not only showed no respect for his elders, but also had completely forgotten the 20 years of nurturing he had received. Therefore, in addition to commissioning a lawyer to publish a statement in the newspaper severing their father-son relationship, he also reported the original threatening letter and all the bad deeds to Liu Yunfang, the director of the second section of the first district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who immediately ordered his subordinates to arrest his son, Sun Derong, for interrogation and subsequent punishment.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Rescuing an Abused Maid <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Reported by the Ciyouhui (慈幼會 - Child Welfare Association), Transferred to the Police Station</p>
<p>The Maid is Temporarily Sent to the Jiliang Institute (濟良所 - Institute for Rescuing Women) After Interrogation</p>
<p>Li Jieshun, a girl from Suqian, Jiangbei, is currently 17 years old. Since childhood, due to poverty, her parents sold her to Chen Yangwen, a native of Anhui, as a maid for 60 yuan. Chen is a tea merchant who lives with his family at No. 36, Lane 646, Tiantong Road. However, since Li came to Chen's house as a maid, for more than ten years, she has been subjected to abuse by Chen's wife, Wen, who often mistreats her and whips her at every turn. This was seen by Zhu Desi, a teacher at the nearby Zhonghua Girls' School, who felt great pity. She then wrote a letter to the Zhonghua Ciyouhui, describing everything in detail. Zhao Jian, a clerk of the association, secretly investigated and confirmed the facts, and immediately reported to the Huishi Police Station. The police station sent Detective Shang Wu and Bao Detective Ke Zhang to bring Li to the police station at 7 p.m. the day before yesterday. After transferring her to Guangren Hospital for examination and injuries, she was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for shelter. Yesterday morning, the institute sent the girl to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court for instructions. Jiang Baolian, the police station's lawyer, then presented the case, stating that Chen Yangwen, the girl's master, was not in Shanghai, so the police station had summoned Chen Wen, the mistress, for questioning yesterday. According to Mrs. Chen, she had scolded and beaten Li the day before because Li had gone to the barber shop to have her hair trimmed, and Li insisted that the mistress go with her, which led to an argument. However, Li's conduct on weekdays was poor, and she often spoke insolently to the mistress, resulting in the beatings. Yesterday, the police station sent Li to Guangren Hospital, which confirmed that she had minor injuries on her left arm and right leg. Now, Chen Wen and all the witnesses have turned themselves in and requested a hearing. Li Jieshun stated that she was 17 years old, and her parents used to be in Jiangbei. She was sold to the Chen family as a maid at the age of four and has been repeatedly abused and beaten. A few days ago, Teacher Zhu saw that she was pitiful and offered help. Now, she does not want to go back with the mistress, nor does she want to sue her. She wants to go to the Jiliang Institute to study. Zhu Desi, a teacher at the Zhonghua Girls' School, testified that she reported to the Ciyouhui because she saw Chen Wen repeatedly abusing the girl. When Chen Wen was questioned, she admitted that she had spent 60 yuan to buy Li as an adopted daughter more than ten years ago, but denied abuse. Judge Deng Baosun reviewed the confession and ordered Li Jieshun to be temporarily placed in the Jiliang Institute.</p>

<p>If the Police Abandon the Appeal</p>
<p>Chen Can Immediately Regain His Freedom</p>
<p>On December 15, 1928, an assassination case occurred in Yinghua Lane, Roberts Road, West Shanghai. At that time, Chen Hongyu (also known as Xiaoxing) was shot and killed. The police subsequently arrested the perpetrators, Pan Qifang and Chen Bingquan, and sent them to the First Special Court. After interrogation, Pan was sentenced to death and is currently detained in prison, awaiting approval from higher authorities for execution. Chen Bingquan was sentenced to life imprisonment. Chen was dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch Court, but his appeal was rejected. However, Chen Bingquan's wife, believing that her husband had been wrongly accused, hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to appeal to the Supreme Court. After review, the Supreme Court found that there were still doubts in the case and sent it back to the Second Branch Court for a retrial. The retrial concluded on the 26th of last month. The day before yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Yu announced the judgment. The main text read, "The original judgment is revoked, and Chen Bingquan is declared not guilty." However, Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, stated that the police station still needed to consider whether to appeal Chen Bingquan and requested permission to remand him in custody, which the court granted. If the police abandon the appeal, Chen can be released. Therefore, Chen's acquittal this time is entirely due to the efforts of Chen's lawyer.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Min (Fujian) Ships Still Export</p>
<p>Fuzhou was rumored on the 1st of this month that bandits had arrived at Shuikou Baisha, 36 li (Chinese miles) from the provincial capital. Yesterday, a follow-up report was received that after the provincial government sent troops upstream, the provincial capital had been stabilized. The Shanghai-Fuzhou ships are operating as usual. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Provincial Troops Headed Upstream</p>
<p>Since receiving reports of bandits at Baisha Shuikou, the Fujian provincial military and political authorities loaded troops and sailed upstream from Sanduao on the 2nd. Yesterday, Shanghai received a follow-up telegram from Fujian stating that the bandits in the Shuikou area are now being resisted by the provincial army, and Fuzhou is peaceful. The provincial army is currently advancing to pursue and suppress the bandits. The market in Fuzhou is as usual, and the people are very stable.</p>
<p>Merchant Ships Sail as Usual</p>
<p>Jiesheng, a ship from Jardine Matheson, and Jing'an, a ship from Sanbei Company, both loaded passengers and goods as usual yesterday and sailed out of the port this morning, heading straight for Nantai, Fuzhou. However, the goods shipped from Shanghai to Fujian are exceptionally scarce this time.</p>
<p>Japanese People's Stories Exaggerated</p>
<p>There are not many Japanese people in Fuzhou, but there are quite a few Taiwanese people. This time, they used the excuse of bandits to exaggerate the stories. However, yesterday, the Fuzhou gang received a telegram from the Hakka saying that the provincial capital was stable, and the Fujian provincial government was even more serious about protecting foreigners. The public security is stable, and all industries are still trading as usual. There is no panic at all.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Bloodshed in a Mahjong Game <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Chen Tian's Consciousness Confused</p>
<p>Fu Shuangfu Detained Pending Investigation</p>
<p>Chen Tian, a woman from Zhenjiang, 32 years old, lives at Zhongxin Road, Zhaogu Road, in the city. At around 8 p.m. the day before yesterday, she was playing the game of "Fangcheng" (mahjong) with Fu Shuangfu, who owns a coal shop next door, and others, with 500 points per small game. Because Fu discarded a "9 of Bamboo", the next player happened to be waiting for a "6 and 9 of Bamboo" to complete a pure suit with three sets. Chen was not convinced, arguing that Fu should not have discarded the "9 of Bamboo" because the next player had already declared three "筒子" (bamboo suit) tiles. A heated argument ensued. Unexpectedly, Fu Shuangfu was unwilling to be outdone and retorted with barbed words. Chen became enraged and accused Fu of speaking rudely. She rushed forward, grabbed him, and slapped his face. Fu struggled free and grabbed a cup, throwing it violently. It hit Chen Tian's forehead, causing her head to bleed immediately and breaking two blood vessels above her eyebrows. She lost a lot of blood and fainted to the ground. People who saw this were shocked and alarmed. They realized that Fu Shuangfu had caused the trouble and quickly called the police, who arrested Fu Shuangfu and took him to the second section of the second district for interrogation. The injured person was sent to Qu Zhibu Hospital for treatment. The doctor found that the injury was not minor and quickly used medicine to seal and bandage it. Yesterday morning, Police Chief Gao from the police station sent the accused to the local court for investigation. Police Chief Gao requested an early hearing because Chen Tian was unconscious and there was a fear that her life was in danger. Early treatment might save her. Heeding the instruction, the prosecutor opened a court session and found that Chen Tian was seriously injured. He ordered her to be sent to the hospital for treatment, and Fu Shuangfu was detained pending further instructions.</p>
<p>Cigarette and Tobacco Industry Association</p>
<h3 id="e149">Discussion on Methods for Increasing License Donations <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette and Tobacco Industry Association previously received a request from members such as Ding Ruitai of Laobaidu Street, stating that the original license donation of 2 yuan was now to be increased to 20 yuan, and the others were to be increased to 4, 8, or 12 yuan. They requested the association to seek relief measures. The association invited representatives from the industry north and south of Shanghai the day before yesterday to hold a meeting to discuss the measures, which were reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, the members from the southern city went to the office in the south of Shanghai and continued to hold a discussion meeting at 3 p.m. Many people attended, and Chai Yasheng was elected as the chairman to report on the progress of the meeting in recent days. Then, Qian Xuanqing and other members of Yongkang Company reported that they had read in yesterday's newspaper that the Finance Bureau's talk about the license tax must be collected in accordance with the regulations, expressing determination to regard tobacco and alcohol products as consumables with anesthetic and toxic properties, which would harm society and should be banned or heavily taxed to increase the selling price so that people would no longer buy them. Local social morals could be clarified. Now, the Finance Bureau intends to ban consumable and anesthetic tobacco and alcohol products and increase taxes heavily to increase their selling prices so that people will not be harmed by the poison. Its intention is very good, but Shanghai's tobacco and alcohol merchants should not bear the burden alone. Other ports have not yet implemented this. It is too inconsiderate of the livelihoods of Shanghai's tobacco and alcohol merchants. It is inappropriate compared to the resolution of the All-Financial Conference. However, the licenses previously obtained by our industry were to pay the tax on domestic tobacco. Now, the domestic tobacco in this city has disappeared. We have no choice but to also operate cigarettes, but the profit is very small. Daily life is still difficult to maintain. The cigarette licenses should be included in the consolidated tax in the 20th year, and a separate cigarette shop license should be sold, which should be exempt. Now, not only are they not exempt, but they are also heavily taxed, which is also inappropriate. If you must increase the tax, it should be added to the consolidated tax so that the burden on merchants is not increased, the government's tax revenue is sufficient, and the people's livelihoods are maintained. If the Finance Bureau regards tobacco and alcohol as harmful to society, it should petition the central government to order the national administrative organs to strictly investigate, prohibit, and ban them. It should not increase the taxes heavily, creating a new record for Shanghai's tobacco and alcohol merchants. If the selling prices of tobacco and alcohol in the Chinese area of this city are increased, cutting off the customers, will it make the concession prosper and put the Chinese industry to death? The authorities should be asked to consider whether this is in line with the meaning of the late Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Subsequently, Qian Wenda, Chen Enqi, Wang Bingzhong, and others successively proposed three measures: (1) If members in the southern city are forced to pay heavy taxes after applying for registration or obtaining licenses, they should prepare a letter and send it to this office, which will be forwarded to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request correction and reduction to show fairness. (2) If there is oppressive behavior, the final course of action will be determined. (3) A draft will be submitted to the executive committee to issue a declaration. The meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Domestic Matches</p>
<h3 id="e150">Sales Unimpeded After Price Increase <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai match industry was almost unsustainable due to being restricted by foreign goods dumping and running at a loss. Later, after the Ministry of Finance issued a new tariff rate for imported goods, it was able to inhibit dumping slightly. However, the cost of raw materials and labor is expensive. Since the price cut, it has not recovered. The match industry could not bear it for long, so it specially convened six provinces in Shanghai in May to form a match industry maintenance association and agreed to increase the price of each box by 1 to 5 or 6 yuan to maintain capital. This was approved by the Ministry of Finance. Yesterday, people in the match industry said that sales had not been affected much after the price increase. Also, the match industry association previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to set up a control committee to determine the entire rescue plan for the match industry. The Ministry of Finance has agreed to its request.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Farmers' Education Hall, in view of the lack of fire-fighting knowledge among rural farmers, and in order to protect local security, must engage in practice to become skilled in rescue in case of emergency. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., a large-scale fire drill was held at Shennong Bridge in Zhuanqiao Town, Hu-Min Road. In addition to the full participation of the local fire brigades in the exercise, Director Zhang invited the Nanshi Fire Fighting Federation to send fire trucks to demonstrate various technologies, and invited Zhu Liangcai and Xia Guoliang to lecture on fire prevention knowledge. More than a thousand firefighters and people went to participate that day. The firefighters demonstrated various rescue technologies, all of which were skillful and amazing.

<h3 id="e153">Negotiating the Arbitrary Arrest of Good Women <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Second Special District Municipal Federation of Shanghai sent a letter to the French Police yesterday because Jin Yu, a member of the association, reported that detectives from the French Police had arbitrarily detained good women and asked for negotiations. The letter reads: "Regarding the matter that Jin Yu, a member of our association, reported that his wife, Jin Wang, and others hired a rickshaw on the night of July 27 to go to the roof of the Great World for cooling off due to the hot weather. When the rickshaw went to the front of the Empire Cinema on Avenue Joffre, they were forced to get off the rickshaw and detained at the Songshan Road Police Station by detective Wang Changshan of the police station without asking the reason. Later, after investigation by the police station, it was confirmed that they were the wife of the reporter, and they were released. However, from arrest to release, it took no less than two hours. The detective abused his power in this way and arbitrarily arrested good women. According to the law, he has violated Article 140 of the Criminal Law and Article 316, Paragraph 1, of the crime of obstructing freedom. Your association should uphold justice and ensure the safety of residents. Based on this, it is found that the body and actions of the people must not be arrested or imprisoned unless according to law. Now, the detective arbitrarily detained good women without asking the reason, which is extremely illegal. If this disturbance to the people is not severely punished, it will be difficult for the residents in the concession to live in peace. According to the previous situation, we should ask your police station to severely punish the detective and ensure that the same incident does not happen again in the future to ensure the safety of residents. Please investigate and handle this matter, and we hope to see a reply." This letter is addressed to the French Police.</p>

<p>American Weather Hot, Business Affected</p>
<p>Preparations Underway for Participation in International Exhibition</p>
<p>The seventh batch of products from our country participating in the Chicago Exposition was originally scheduled to be shipped today, but the quantity was too small, and the customs duties and freight were not cost-effective. It has been decided to wait until a large batch of goods is collected for one shipment to Chicago. It is reported that it has been scheduled for the 14th of this month and will still be loaded by the Dollar Company's President Hoover. In addition to the Jiangxi porcelain and Ningxia specialty products in this batch of products, there are also lacquer silk figures produced by the Fujian Hui'er Institute, including four figures: U.S. President Roosevelt, Oil King, Steel King, and Car King, as well as many antiques and paintings. The association recently received a telegram from the director stationed in Chicago, which stated that the weather is very hot here, there are fewer visitors, and business has been slightly affected. According to the resident director in Chicago in previous years, the weather is also the same when it is hot, so there is nothing strange about it. As for the association's plan to organize participation in the International Product Exhibition, preparations have begun, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been requested to approve it. Once approved, it will be carried out.</p>

<p>Liu Meisheng, a native of Pudong, 36 years old, used to be a clerk in a foreign goods store. He is now unemployed. Due to economic pressure, he suddenly developed a pessimistic view of the world. The night before last, he went to the Ruiyu Inn at No. 30 Songshan Road in the French Concession alone, rented a room, and secretly swallowed raw opium to commit suicide. It was not until about 10 a.m. yesterday that the waiter discovered it and reported it to the bookkeeper, who reported it to the police station.

<h3 id="e159">A Dispute in a Bathhouse <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>A Storm Arose from a Minor Incident</p>
<p>Four Children Were the Root Cause of the Disaster</p>
<p>In the Weitsen Yuan Bathhouse on Haihong Road, Lannidu, Pudong, at about 7 p.m. the night before last, a bather, Chen Hongju from Hubei, brought his two sons, Anxin (9 years old) and Anyi (6 years old), into the pool to take a bath. At that time, two children from Shaoxing, Huang Haiying (11 years old) and Huang Puying (9 years old), were also bathing next to them. Suddenly, Anxin and Anyi fought each other for a place, and Sun Lianggui, a Yangzhou back-scrubber, pulled them away. Anxin and Anyi were still angry. Because their home was nearby at No. 6 Hede Lane, which was very close to the bathhouse, they ran home to tell their mother, Chen Xia. Xia heard that her son had been bullied and went to the bathhouse to argue. Sun Hesan, the shop assistant, thought it was ridiculous for a woman to walk into the bathroom and pushed her out. Chen Hongju, her husband, became even more angry and gathered dozens of small workers from his gang to break into the bathhouse and commit violence. Many doors and windows were destroyed. Most of the teaware in the pool was also smashed, and Jiang Rujing, the cashier, was beaten. Three police officers from the station went to arrest the perpetrators and took the principal offender, Chen Hongju and Chen Xia, as well as accomplices Xiang Yunchun, Zhang Minghua, Wu Xikui, Zhong Daofa, Zhong Daoming, and others from Hubei, along with the three plaintiffs and four children involved, to the district. After Zhang, the district chief, learned the cause, he ordered Jiang Rujing to be sent to the hospital for treatment. The plaintiffs and defendants were sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Temporarily Stayed at the Police Station Awaiting Employer's Claim</p>
<p>Zhang Cao, a young woman from Jiangyin, is 22 years old. She was previously married to Zhang Yinchun, a native of Zhenjiang who runs a jade business. After marriage, the couple lived together at No. 13 Liujiahe, Xinchengmen, Suzhou. Zhang's business has been slow recently, so he entrusted a matchmaker shop in Suzhou to recommend his wife, Cao, to work as a maid in a mansion in Shanghai. She has only been working in Shanghai for 16 days. The day before yesterday, the employer's two-year-old child suddenly became ill. The employer's mother (i.e., the sick child's grandmother) ordered Cao to hold the child and go to a Western doctor for diagnosis and treatment. After completion, the child's grandmother asked Cao to take the child home first. However, Cao did not know the roads well and rashly agreed to hold the child. When she left the doctor's office, she did not know how to get back. She wandered on the road near the Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession. A patrolman saw the woman holding a child and thought she was suspicious. He went forward to ask and learned that she was lost. He immediately took her to the Lujiawan Central Police Station and sent detectives to investigate. Because the people could not explain where the employer lived, there was no way to find and summon them. The head of the police ordered her to stay temporarily, waiting for her employer to come and claim her.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Extortionist Cao Shifang Sentenced <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Cao Shifang, a local resident, lived at No. 132 Taopeng Road. Because he was poor and bored, he wrote threatening letters from the 17th to the 26th of last month and delivered them to No. 184 Xin'anli, Yangshupu Road, extorting 5,000 yuan from Shen Shengda, the owner of the Shen Shengji Construction Factory from Pudong. Initially, due to an unclear address, five letters were mistakenly sent to No. 190 in the same neighborhood to Zhang Tongjun, a Ningbo native who worked as a bookkeeper at the Ewo Cotton Mill. Three of the letters were directly delivered to No. 184. After the case was discovered, detective Xie Wanfang and detective Tang Pengfei of the Yulin Road Police Station arrested Cao Shifang and found a set of letter shells and envelopes at his home. He was sent to the First Special District Court together. The interrogation and confession have been recorded in this newspaper. During the adjourned investigation, it was found that the defendant had written similar letters between January 5th and March 27th of this year and sent them to Cai Yousheng at No. 5 Jixiang Lane, Dongxi Huade Road, and to the monk Song Hanjiang (a doctor of salty business) at No. 27 Fenzhou Road, extorting silver dollars, otherwise threatening them with bombs and pistols. As a result, Dr. Cai only got four yuan, and Song got nothing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiexun presided over a continued hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, gave a detailed account of the incident and presented more than a dozen letters received by the three plaintiffs, requesting a thorough investigation. Subsequently, the plaintiffs and representatives Fei Huilin and Xu Wushan testified about the situation at the time and questioned the defendant, who admitted everything without denial and asked for leniency. Judge Xiao sentenced Cao Shifang to six years in prison. The number of days in detention before the judgment was finalized will be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The threatening letters were confiscated.</p>

At that time, the captain was released and instructed to prepare money in Shanghai for ransom. The captain then went to Shanghai to collect the money the day before yesterday. However, the ship had already been burned by the pirates, and one member of the crew was killed. The reason for the burning and killing was the delay in the agreed time. It is said that the loss of the ship and cargo is worth about 20,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces Drought Relief Appeal <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society received letters from Chen Yici, Zhu Liangting, Gu Youmin, and Xu Maozhao, gentlemen of Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province, stating that since the beginning of summer, the weather has been severely dry, and 80 to 90 percent of the rice seedlings have withered and died. Replacements cannot be planted in time, and farmers have no rice to cook. The weak fill the ditches, and the strong take risks. Mr. Zhou Yangsong, a representative of the society, held a letter requesting relief. According to a telegram from Li Dexing and others of the Drought Relief Committee of Taihu County, Anhui Province, Tai County has suffered a long drought without rain, and the autumn crops are hopeless. Those who survive banditry are also victims of a disastrous year. The cries of the starving are everywhere, and there are tens of thousands of disaster-stricken households, begging for urgent relief. According to a telegram from Quan Jiao County, Anhui Province, since the great flood of the 20th year, the vitality has not recovered. This spring, there was another hailstorm, which reduced the harvest of the two wheats. Now, they are suffering from a drought, the rural areas are collapsing, nine out of ten households are empty, and they are selling their children and migrating. The suffering is unspeakable, and they are waiting for relief to survive. According to this, in recent years, floods and droughts have occurred frequently, and relief efforts are overwhelming. Now, Zhejiang and Anhui are reporting disasters, and the remaining hungry people are waiting for rescue. The association has already provided relief to Chang'an, Shaanxi, and Yingshang, Taihe, and Fuyang counties in Anhui this year, and the funds are insufficient, making it difficult to continue. It is hoped that charitable colleagues at home and abroad will donate money to save a life, which is better than building a seven-story pagoda, and the merits and virtues are immeasurable.</p>

<p>Hepingfang, Dongbaoxing Road, Zhabei, organized the Fourth Branch of the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee in Zhabei District to participate in the rent reduction movement. The 42 tenants of the Fang were sued by the Wuhuo Foreign Firm, the manager, in the Shanghai Local Court for arrears in rent. They have been summoned twice. During the first summons, except for the 42 tenants, the remaining tenants stated that the rent arrears were caused by the rent reduction and that the suspension of rent payment was a unanimous action. Therefore, on the one hand, they filed a counterclaim against the owner and the manager in the original court to reduce the rent, and on the other hand, they unanimously participated in the rent arrears lawsuit. It is heard that during the second summons of the rent arrears case, all the tenants unanimously appeared in court. The rent reduction case has also been heard twice, but the defendant owner and the manager have not appeared in court. The rent in this Fang is particularly expensive compared to other places because the owner took advantage of the chaos after the war by the British merchant Wuhe Foreign Firm's management department, and after a slight repair, they took the opportunity to double the rent. The tenants of the Fang have endured hardships and persevered until now. Due to the impact of the recession, life has become increasingly difficult. They have repeatedly sent letters to the owner and the management department, asking them to understand the difficulties and reduce the rent, but they have not received a reply. Representatives were sent to them, but they avoided meeting them. Instead, Wuhe Foreign Firm sued 42 households in the Fang for rent arrears. All the oppression suffered by the Fang prompted them to resist. It is heard that the reasons for demanding rent reduction are quite sufficient. The organization of the association is very sound. The committee must hold meetings twice a week, with no absences. The proposals of the committee members are carefully considered, and the overall unity is very strong. They unanimously refuse to pay rent and store the money in the bank in order to achieve the goal of rent reduction.</p>

<h3 id="e176">How to Watch Movies (Continued) <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Chinese movies, without exception, are supporters of a particular social class, because the right to produce them is also controlled by the hands of a particular social class. Initially, films like "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" appeared. The role of these films was clearly to use the influence of legendary novels to more widely implement anesthesia, causing the masses to obediently return to the embrace of the martial arts heroes produced by feudal society, letting the heroes "eliminate violence" for them, letting the heroes "pacify the people," in order to eliminate the masses' struggle for their own survival. However, this kind of effect is the easiest to expose. When the masses in deep water and dire straits never see so-called heroes come to save them, then those superb skills of flying over walls and walking on eaves finally become only illusions in their minds. Therefore, what followed was the production of distorted love movies. Chinese love movies are often different from European and American love movies. European and American love movies completely use the stimulation of flesh and gorgeous sets to eliminate anger towards life, but Chinese love movies are not like this. Their main content mostly describes a woman who falls in love because she is tempted by material things and seduced by men. The result is either being abused or abandoned by the man, or pulling back from the brink, finally awakening and completing the satisfactory return of lovers becoming family. Of course, the effect of this kind of film is much more effective than martial arts films. Undoubtedly, it has temporarily satisfied some backward elements, and won them a sigh of sympathy, but this is only a sigh of sympathy after all, only temporary satisfaction. Therefore, these clever gentlemen must once again further implement their clever schemes from another aspect. Recent films such as "Sister Flowers," "Song of the Fishermen," as well as "The Wild History of Yao Mountain," and "Mr. Wang," are products that achieve their ultimate goals through various different expressions. Films such as "The Wild History of Yao Mountain" and "Mr. Wang," the former uses an adventurous and bizarre story, while the latter is purely a boring and ridiculous story. These films, whether in content or form, are actually "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" with a changed face. Here, we want to specifically mention "Sister Flowers" and "Song of the Fishermen." They are currently the most attractive films to the audience. In "Sister Flowers," Da Bao and Er Bao, sisters from the same background, one due to her outstanding beauty, gains the favor of a general and even climbs to the position of wife, while the other, due to her unattractive appearance, is forever trapped in a life of hardship, and even becomes a prisoner. This contrast already contains the effect of "everything is fate," not to mention that the author imagines a very accidental reunion in the ending, completing the great happy ending of "one person achieves enlightenment, even his dogs and chickens rise to heaven." To be honest, "Sister Flowers" is comparable to "Laughing Destiny."</p>
<p>The above is the complete picture of the colorful Chinese film industry. If you want to gain any nourishment from it, it is very difficult. On the one hand, movies are supporters of a particular social class, but on the other hand, they must have an audience to support them. For business reasons, they must cater to the market. Therefore, only the power of the audience can promote the production of mass films.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>I Come From The East (XIV)</p>
<p>— Hoshino</p>
<p>The most ridiculous were the three Filipinos on the ship. One was a professor of engineering at the University of the Philippines, and the other two were students at the University of Chicago. The professor was very prejudiced, thinking that everything in the Philippines was the best in the world. He said that his own daughter was more beautiful than any Hollywood actress. He also said that when he went to the United States, in every city, there were young American girls who admired his appearance and pursued him. One of the University of Chicago students immediately mocked him, saying that he was bragging because he was fancied by a pheasant. They started arguing. For more than ten days, they were in the same cabin and at the same table, but they didn't greet each other. The engineering professor, to ridicule the student, specially invited another University of Chicago student to live in his home after the ship arrived in Manila. Every time the professor talked to us, mentioning the advantages of the Philippines, the student would make jokes and harsh criticisms to us. The professor was a rough and dark brute. Everyone called him a boxer to his face, and secretly we regarded him as a bandit. The University of Chicago student was a thin and yellow youth, probably too romantic in the lower-class places in Chicago. His appearance was like a Shanghai gangster.</p>
<p>On the ship, we also met two sisters from Hong Kong. They boarded the ship from Hawaii. The older sister had a bit of seasickness and often stayed in bed, but the younger sister was not afraid of the wind and waves. On warm and sunny afternoons, the highest deck of the ship, quiet and bright, became the best place for us to talk and play games. We often played ping-pong, forgetting the time for meals. Both sisters had a good foundation and deep interest in Chinese literature. When we talked about Song poetry and Yuan opera, sometimes we laughed heartily, and sometimes we suddenly seemed to understand something. The older sister could dance the graceful Hawaiian hula, and the younger sister could sing Hawaiian songs and play the piano. There was nothing to do on the ship, and enjoying the beautiful music and dance, we unconsciously felt as if a second free and happy Hawaii had appeared in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>On the eve of the ship's arrival in Shanghai, we leaned on the railing as usual. The cool sea breeze made our hair messy. The black night sky was full of stars, and they were describing the beautiful scenery of a clear night in Hawaii. I felt that their words were very poetic, and the younger sister was also very good at Chinese painting. No wonder her descriptions were very vivid. It was a pity that they couldn't speak Mandarin, and I couldn't speak Cantonese, so we used English instead. The sea was black in the deep night. As the steamship passed, it dragged a white snow wave behind it. We quietly looked at the nearing end of our journey, and everyone felt a nameless sense of melancholy.</p>
<h3 id="e177">What I Saw in Tokyo <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>On Pacific mail ships, except for Japanese ships, the sailors are all Chinese. The so-called Chinese refers to people from Guangdong, or several counties such as Taishan in Guangdong. Their possession of today's advantages is not because of skills or strength, but because they can accept the lowest wages. According to the Chinese sailors on the ship, they each get twenty-five Hong Kong dollars per month, and because of this little salary, they risk their lives in the ships of the Pacific. Of course, I don't know how many more Chinese people in the country accept even lower wages, with working environments that are worse and more bitter than on the ship, and are treated even more cruelly by their employers. But I often look at those Chinese crew members in white short shirts and blue long pants, those Chinese youths living under the yelling and scolding commands and attitudes of foreigners, and some of them are really very healthy and have very clear minds, and I feel very uncomfortable in my heart. I feel that they should not be working here.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Two Different Opinions from Mr. Wu Zhihui <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>It is gratifying that Mr. Wu Zhihui has also come to participate in the discussion of the mass language. Mr. Wu has not expressed his opinions on academic issues for a long time, but from this letter to Mr. Cao Juren, we can see that he has been paying attention to the issue of "mass language" from the beginning. Although the opinions expressed are somewhat vague in some places, they have indeed been carefully considered and are not just perfunctory. Therefore, these opinions are very noteworthy and worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu also agrees with the establishment of a mass language, which will dispel the confusion of many people. Although it is a very small minority, there are still people who express doubt about the mass language, or say: "What exactly is the mass language?" or say: "The mass language is fundamentally wrong." For these people, a few words from Mr. Wu are enough to deal with them: "Classical Chinese, vernacular Chinese, and mass language have differences in ease of widespread adoption. Of course, vernacular Chinese is easier to be widely adopted than classical Chinese, and mass language will definitely be easier to be widely adopted than vernacular Chinese." To put it simply: the mass language is the most widespread language, which answers the question of "what exactly is the mass language." Vernacular Chinese is not widespread enough, and the mass language needs to be even more widespread. What could be wrong with that? However, if someone has a bit of a problem with their brain, they may still doubt "widespread": "Why must it be widespread?" Once it reaches this point, we can ignore them and let them doubt until they die! The mass language will henceforth be strongly demanded. Due to its "widespreadness," bookstores will demand mass language to compile books, because this will attract more readers. Film companies will demand mass language for explanations and dialogue, because this will attract more viewers. All propaganda and advertising agencies will also demand mass language for their use... The propositions and innovations of all scholars are not as powerful as actual needs, let alone the doubts and opposition of those with brain diseases.</p>
<p>If the mass language is established and is universally used by the masses, but the books compiled using this language and the movies explained still talk about poor people being beaten on the buttocks by the master and having to kowtow and thank him, and a young man and a young woman "doing clerkish" in the back garden... then the masses will still not watch it. As a result, the bookstore owner and the film company owner will still not be able to earn money. At that time, the "mass language" will still be negated.</p>
<p>This shows the importance of the issue of consciousness in the mass language issue. The so-called issue of consciousness is also the "defending the Way" issue that Wu Zhihui mentioned.</p>
<p>However, although Mr. Wu denies that literary style is related to defending the Way, I believe it is related.</p>
<p>For example, "Punishments do not extend to the high officials, rituals do not extend to the common people." These two sentences are classical Chinese that defends the Way, but they must not be translated into vernacular Chinese, let alone into mass language. The key lies entirely in the vagueness, or rather the beauty, of the words "punishments" and "rituals." The common people are foolish, but there is a limit to their foolishness. When they don't understand the meaning of what people are saying, they will foolishly believe it, but once they understand it, they will begin to doubt, and even become "angry." Therefore, the ancients established creeds, and the wording was always made as vague, general, abstract, and mysterious as possible, so that people would not understand it. This is what is meant by "fooling the people." Classical Chinese is suitable for the purpose of "fooling the people," so only classical Chinese can defend the Way without any flaws. Using vernacular Chinese can certainly write a "rituals do not extend to the common people" theory, but it will inevitably be too blunt and ultimately not good. If the purpose is to preach a doctrine or an ideology to the people, in order to make them understand, such as the Three Principles of the People, then it must be in vernacular Chinese. Classical Chinese can certainly write the Three Principles of the People, but it will never be as popular as vernacular Chinese. For an ideology to be universally understood and accepted, it must utilize a universal literary style. From this, we can see that literary style and defending the Way are indeed closely related, a point that Mr. Wu seems to have never considered.</p>
<p>I also have some different opinions on Mr. Wu's theory that "literature must die, and the great disaster will not stop." Mr. Wu's original intention was very good. He advocated using science and technology to relieve the masses, but he thought that literature and other knowledge were "harmful to your country and fierce to your family," so he advocated tearing it down. This intention was entirely for the country and for the masses. However, Mr. Wu thought things were too simple. He said, "If the mass language is unified, writing some simple science and technology articles" can "benefit the masses' rice bowls." Science and technology themselves have the potential to save the country and save the masses, but under the current circumstances, it is not possible. Just look at the United States. The language is unified, and science and technology are developed, but President Roosevelt is working hard on economic recovery, which shows that its national economy is declining. Its veterans and workers often riot and strike, which shows that not all of its masses have good rice bowls. Science and technology cannot save these situations. Is it entirely the fault of literature? This is generally not logical.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu meant that literature is entirely a trick played by intellectuals, and the masses do not need it now. Therefore, he said: "Wait until the loafers in the alleys need alley entertainment, and then let them create mass literature." This is also incorrect. The loafers in the alleys, the villagers in the fields, have always had everything, including literature, philosophy, and their own technology and science, fundamentally because they have all these needs. However, everything they currently have is low-level in terms of quality and poor in terms of quantity, and the masses of you and the masses of us are different from each other, not communicating and integrating, and therefore not changing and progressing. The establishment of the mass language is precisely to use the power of universal language to communicate and integrate the consciousness of all the masses of you and us, to enrich it, to change it, to make it progress, and to replace the original local and low-level everything with universal and high-level literature, philosophy, etc. The important thing here is still the purification of the consciousness of the masses. The psychology of the masses is the same as the psychology of the intellectuals. They are definitely not without other needs besides "rice bowls." Literature is also what they need. After the mass language is established, there will of course be mass language literature. (Moreover, in fact, the establishment of the mass language must first go through the attempt of mass language literature.) Mr. Wu has unfairly placed the responsibility for the "great disaster" on "literature," and it is even more incomprehensible to fundamentally deny literature. To support the mass language but deny mass language literature is to buy the casket and return the pearl.</p>
<p>Since the issue of establishing the mass language was established, I have fully agreed, but what I am researching is the technical issue of establishing the mass language and mass language literature, and I plan to write an article on one aspect. Now that I have seen Mr. Wu's paper, I feel that it is necessary to clarify the above two points, so I wrote this article first.</p>
<h3 id="e179">The Moon Lute (Continued) <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>The workers faithfully worked for the boss year in and year out. A kind of eager ambition to become nouveau riche sometimes makes them, after they receive their "monthly wages," regardless of whether their families are starving, bravely go to the gambling house to make a desperate gamble! But if they unfortunately fail, they will not regret it at all (thinking that the hard-earned price has been given to others for nothing). They still work hard. All-day fatigue, as well as sorrow for life, are wildly vented through various different actions and expressions in the evening after work.</p>
<p>Every night, I was so moved by Lao Zhang's moving moon lute sound. In the noisy kitchen, under the dim gas lamp, I lazily lay on a moldy straw mat that Lao Zhang used as a floor mat next to him. Lao Zhang leaned against the wall and leisurely and absentmindedly played his old moon lute. A kind of melancholy, passion, weeping, anger, and rebellious clear sound vibrated in the irritable and depressing air, and all the shouts and rude voices would be silent like death.</p>
<p>When he first plays, he always plays some affectionate love songs and passionate love tunes, such as "Riverside Tune" (5), "Seaweed Tune" (6)... Gradually, he also plays the accompaniment to "Three-Step Walk" (7), a rhythmic and melodic sound that stimulates everyone's ears, and people will clap their hands in rhythm with him, or even impulsively and unconsciously start to dance the "Walk" (8).</p>
<p>After playing so enthusiastically for a while, he waited until people felt a little tired, and then gently played the poignant and compelling:</p>
<p>In October, it is cold and bleak,</p>
<p>Write a letter home to my wife:</p>
<p>There is no change at home,</p>
<p>Sell some odd things at will.</p>
<p>Don't want Guangdong haos,</p>
<p>Hubei haos are more or less acceptable.</p>
<p>The gloomy sound leads the hearts of everyone who is suffering so sour, and tears unknowingly flow on the dirty cheeks, almost crying!</p>
<h3 id="e180">Reply to Mr. Wu Zhihui (Excerpt) <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Mr. Zhihui: Recently, while compiling "A History of the Debate Between Classical and Vernacular Chinese," I reread the "Awakening," "Learning Lamp," "Yusi," "National Language," and "Modern Review" from the thirteenth and fourteenth years of the Republic of China, and I couldn't help but smile bitterly. "You can't teach an old dog new tricks." As Mr. Liu Bannong had to say, "Only the Chinese would be so hopeless, forever circling aimlessly on problems that are not problems." Mr. Wang Maozu was entangled with Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi in the "New Youth." He sang a duet with Zhang Shizhao in "Post-Jia Yin" as if it were a serious matter. This time, he is reviving and reviving with such great enthusiasm. (Omission) Although the matter is foolish, the heart is of course pitiful!</p>
<p>(Above omission) Mr. previously detailed Zhang Shizhao's psychology, saying that his kind of bird-willow writing was intended to be appreciated by the ruling party and to amaze the bureaucrats; that kind of "Chen Xian's son taught his son to flatter" and other "ruling party examinations" were nothing more than the result of admiring actor-writers. If his wife was not ashamed and wept in the courtyard, I would not believe that such a thing really exists in the world... This time, Mr. is particularly forgiving towards Mr. Wang and Mr. Liu, saying that they have "seven parts intention to save people, and three parts intention to defend the Way." He also said: "Mr. Wang, Mr. Liu and others have no preconceived ideas, they are sacrificing for others, not protecting themselves." I privately disagree a little. After Mr. Wang's theory of reviving classical Chinese was published in "Times Public Opinion," it was followed by a response of "The Naturalness and Inevitability of the Revival of Classical Chinese," and the old spells of world affairs and human hearts in "Jia Yin" magazine were chanted. The Nanjing correspondent of "Ta Kung Pao" said how the revival of classical Chinese had become a new trend... These clues tell us: Mr. Wang's advocacy of reviving classical Chinese... the younger brother's way out is secondary, taking advantage of the chaotic world to grab a topic to write slogans and paste slogans, without waiting for Freud to analyze it, one can see his lungs and liver. (Omission) I feel that the atmosphere of this revival of classical Chinese is too similar to the "tiger" atmosphere of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, and we cannot forgive it!</p>
<p>The mass language issue should be "lowered without much high theory," and the masses should do it themselves. It is "self-evident" and beyond doubt. The current thing is that we must first persuade all our pen-holding friends to relax a little on the power of writing, so that everyone has a hand to move. When Mr. Hu Shi was in the United States, he spent a lot of effort to persuade Mei Guangdi, Ren Hongjun... and those friends to believe that living literature should be done in vernacular Chinese. At one time, Mei Guangdi also said, "The literary revolution should start with folk literature, which goes without saying, but it must go through a major war," and later, after returning to China, he acted as a bodyguard for classical Chinese in "Xue Heng." Pen-holding friends, no matter what, always feel that writing is precious and want to monopolize it and are unwilling to make it public to the masses. Knowing that phonetic alphabets, Roman alphabets, and simplified characters are all tools that are beneficial to the masses, they are deliberately put aside, and they are unwilling to learn them or teach them. I said last year, "Writing wrong characters doesn't matter," and I was scolded a lot. We must at least have the spirit of missionaries, going on again and again, without fear of trouble. I think: The old colleagues of the National Language Research Association must not relax this responsibility. The revolution has not yet succeeded, and comrades still need to work hard." This time, I made a foolish wish and wrote many letters, asking Hu Shi, Zhou Zuoren, Qian Xuantong, Li Jinxi, Fu Sinian, and Dian Yue... in Beijing and Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Sun Fuyuan, and Lu Yiyan... in Shanghai to express their opinions. For example, writing the Diamond Sutra, whether or not it can become a Buddha, let it go, but writing must be done one sheet at a time. Mr. is a founding elder of the national language movement, with "achievements hanging in the universe," and there are many practical things. Please Mr. express some more opinions!</p>

<p>I wander on the ancient ruins accompanied by a lonely, thin shadow, as if something occupies my mind, like the dark night occupying the world before dawn.</p>
<p>At this time, the undulating suburbs have long been dressed in bleak autumn clothes, and the haggard face appears even more haggard, like willows that are about to wither, like roses that have already withered, even more like the rouge on the lips of a dying girl. In the near, in the far, in the farther, one cannot see a single green grass, a single green leaf, a single red flower, only countless earthen mounds, silently waiting for partners to provide steamed bun fillings in the city.</p>
<p>No, there are...</p>
<p>There, one can also see desolate smoke and weeds, one can also see broken tablets and dilapidated monuments, one can also see cold crows and decaying willows: in addition, one can also see the scattered and horizontal defeated battlements, and the three or two collapsing thatched huts.</p>
<p>No, there are...</p>
<p>There, there are also hunchbacked old people, there are also haggard young people, there are also lonely children... they, are working and resting there; they, are sleeping and waking there; they, are singing and crying there; they, are living and dying there.</p>
<p>No, there is...</p>
<p>Oh! The setting sun still lingers in the human world.</p>

<p>Tianjin-Shanghai Interport Tennis Tournament Opens</p>
<h3 id="e185">Zheng Zhaojia Suffers Miserable Defeat <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Erlong Qian Wins in Straight Sets</p>
<p>Little Zheng's Failure is a Great Surprise</p>
<p>One Singles and One Doubles Match Today</p>
<p>(Tianjin, 3rd Dispatch) The Tianjin-Shanghai Interport Tennis Tournament, the first day, was held at 5:00 PM today at the tennis court in the British Concession. Zheng Zhaojia and Erlong Qian, in the second singles match, Little Zheng was miserably defeated by Erlong Qian in straight sets. The match ended at 6:00 PM. The doubles match will be held at 3:00 PM on the 4th. After appearing on the court today, Little Zheng was quite loved by more than a thousand spectators. Because Little Zheng was agile, and Erlong Qian was stout and slow, it was determined that the Tianjin team would definitely lose. Unexpectedly, after the serve, Little Zheng panicked and made mistakes. Many serves went out of bounds, and many volleys were self-destructive. In the first set, Erlong Qian won 6-0 without any effort. Although he struggled in the second set, Erlong Qian's backhand volleys were calm and unhurried. Little Zheng was eager to succeed, and made more and more self-destructive balls. He only won one game in the third game, and then failed repeatedly. He finally lost again 6-2. In the third set, he tried hard to counterattack, but made no progress, and finally lost 6-2. As a result, Tianjin won 3-0. The audience criticized that in terms of individual skills, Little Zheng definitely defeated Erlong Qian, but he failed because he was young and impetuous and could not calmly face the enemy.</p>
<p>Erlong Qian (Tianjin) 6-0, 6-2, 6-2 Zheng Zhaojia (Shanghai)</p>

<p>No Women Participated, Disappointing</p>
<p>The junior children's and women's swimming competitions were held at the Lanyuan Swimming Pool at 8:00 PM last night. No women participated in the competition, which was disappointing. The junior level was for unnamed adult swimmers, and the immaturity of the results was already known. However, young children aged seven, eight, and nine participated more enthusiastically, and the results were even better. Chinese swimming committee members Li Rongyao, Yu Binqi, and Wang Jianxin, etc., decided to ask the Advancement Association to find a way to take them to visit the International Swimming Competition to be held on the 15th to learn from them in order to cultivate young swimming talents.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3 id="e195">Ministry of Education Explains <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Regulations for Entrance Examinations for Vocational Schools and Middle Schools</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently issued two official orders explaining the regulations, which are excerpted below: (1) According to the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education, Article 53 of the regulations for vocational schools states that students' usual grades are calculated by combining daily homework grades and temporary test grades, with daily inspection grades accounting for two-thirds of the usual grade and temporary test grades accounting for one-third. It seems that the usual grade already includes the practical training grade. Article 58 states that those who fail in academic studies, practical training, conduct, and physical education shall not be promoted or graduate. Is it necessary to calculate academic studies and practical training grades separately? Also, does the provision of the regulations for academic study grades refer to the total grade of each subject that must be above 60 points, or must each subject pass before being promoted or graduated? I hereby request instructions, etc. The Ministry of Education explained that the student's usual grade in the regulations for vocational schools naturally includes the practical training grade. However, in order to emphasize practical training, the practical training grade should be taken out for examination to see if it is passing. As for the academic study grade, it refers to the total grade of each subject. However, those who fail in major subjects shall not be promoted or graduated. How to examine students' conduct grades and how to calculate academic study grades should be formulated by the department in accordance with Article 60 of the regulations for vocational schools and submitted for approval separately, etc. (2) According to the Social Affairs Bureau of Beiping City, Article 10 of the regulations for middle school students' graduation entrance examination states that the grades of each subject in the graduation entrance examination must be passing. Does this refer only to the grade of the entrance examination paper, or to the grade after calculation in accordance with Article 7? Also, should certificates for applying for higher education be issued for junior high school students? The Ministry of Education explained that the phrase "the grades of each subject must be passing" in Article 10 of the entrance examination regulations refers to the grade after calculation in accordance with Article 7. If the bureau is unable to issue junior high school graduation certificates, it should issue certificates for applying for higher education, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Declaration of the Jinda Vocational Movement League <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenru National Jinan University Graduate Students Vocational Movement League was established the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the league issued a declaration to respond to the two major leagues of the Pingjing Vocational Movement and decided to visit the party and government and school authorities today to petition. The declaration of the league is excerpted below: The unemployment problem has become the most serious problem in various countries around the world. However, in the past, most of the unemployed were from the labor sector. Today, even intellectuals who have received higher education feel the pain of unemployment. In this regard, the organization of the Peiping University Graduates Vocational Movement League and the subsequent response from Nanjing Central University. Comrades, in view of the fact that graduation is unemployment and that what they have learned is useless, also have the same pain. Therefore, a vocational movement league is specially organized to seek a solution to the occupation and to seek a living, and to respond to the organization of Pingjing to arouse the attention of the whole country. I humbly believe that there are very few staff in the government agencies of our country. According to the law, those who seek employment rely on individual activities, so that relatives and private individuals are mixed in, and the road to success is blocked. As for the quality of their knowledge and the diligence of their work, they are not counted. This is the first point that the government authorities should pay attention to. Today's university education has no definite standards, only knows to enroll students and teach classes. Whether the courses taught are suitable for social needs and how students should be arranged after graduation have never been asked. As a result, what is learned is useless and graduation is unemployment. This is the second point that the education authorities should pay attention to. Comrades, in view of the voice that graduation from university is unemployment, shocking the whole country, we hereby respectfully inform the government and education authorities to pay close attention and immediately seek relief measures, and we deeply hope that the entire press will give sincere sympathy. This is what we deeply hope for.</p>

<h3 id="e201">A Simple Explanation of Class A, B, and C Amplifiers <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>In wireless machinery, the vacuum tube's primary task is amplification. In recent years, wireless technology has advanced rapidly, and although all use vacuum tubes as amplifiers, their working conditions can vary. Hence, the distinction between Class A, B, and C, each with its unique advantages. Except for a few specially designed for a particular class of amplification, most general-purpose vacuum tubes can be made into a specific class of amplifier. This requires adjusting the grid's negative potential and the input signal voltage appropriately to meet certain conditions. The principles and comparative advantages and disadvantages of these three classes of amplifiers are outlined below.</p>
<p>1.  Class A Amplifier: When a vacuum tube is used as a Class A amplifier, the waveform of the plate output is identical to the waveform of the input signal received by the grid. Therefore, there is no distortion, which is highly desirable. Refer to Figure A, which shows the plate current/grid voltage characteristic curve of a vacuum tube. If used as a Class A amplifier, the straight-line portion between points 'a' and 'b' must be utilized. The grid potential is adjusted to approximately the midpoint of this straight line, as indicated by the dashed line. When the grid is stimulated by a signal voltage, the highest point of the positive half-cycle should not exceed zero potential, causing the grid to receive a positive charge. The highest point of the negative half-cycle should not cause the plate current to decrease excessively and reach the lower knee point 'b'. Otherwise, distortion is still difficult to avoid. Close examination of Figure A reveals that the plate current of a Class A amplifier remains constant regardless of variations in the strength of the input voltage. That is, even without any signal voltage input, the vacuum tube constantly consumes maximum power. Therefore, poor efficiency is a significant drawback of Class A amplifiers.</p>
<p>2.  Class B Amplifier: To improve the poor efficiency of Class A amplifiers, Class B amplifiers were developed. The difference lies in employing a higher grid negative potential so that the vacuum tube's plate current is zero when no signal voltage is input, thus not consuming power. When a signal voltage is input, the vacuum tube generates plate current during the positive half-cycle, rising and falling according to the signal voltage's amplitude. During the negative half-cycle, the plate current is completely cut off, so only half of the input voltage is amplified; the other half is cut off, as shown in Figure B. If this Class B amplifier is used for audio frequency amplification, it will inevitably result in complete distortion. However, there are ways to remedy this. Usually, Class B amplifiers use two identical vacuum tubes in a push-pull connection, with each vacuum tube handling the amplification of one half-cycle. These are then combined so that the output voltage state is still consistent with the input. Refer to Figure D for a clearer understanding. Although Class B amplifiers have better efficiency, they have more components and a complex structure. Unless there is a solid understanding of the characteristics of vacuum tubes, success is often difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>3.  Class C Amplifier: The grid's negative potential in a Class C amplifier must be higher than that of a Class B amplifier, typically about twice the voltage required to completely cut off the plate current. The voltage stimulating the grid must also be very high, with the highest point of the positive half-cycle sufficient to saturate the vacuum tube's plate current. Referring to Figure C, it is evident that the output voltage state is completely distorted. Therefore, Class C amplifiers absolutely cannot be used for audio frequency amplification. However, they are highly suitable for use as high-frequency amplifiers in broadcasting transmitters. This is because the only requirement for the output high-frequency voltage is that its envelope does not lose the original state of the input. How each voltage is distorted is effectively irrelevant. Another feature of Class C amplifiers is that their output power is always proportional to the power input to their plate.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Self-Made Intermediate Frequency Transformer Method <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yingfu</p>
<p>In superheterodyne receiver circuits, the intermediate frequency (IF) transformer is undeniably a crucial component. However, these transformers are currently difficult to find on the market, and even when available, they are often prohibitively expensive. This puts them out of reach for budget-conscious amateur enthusiasts, leaving them sighing at the prospect of heterodyne receivers. However, these transformers can be readily made.</p>
<p>If the circuit includes a high-frequency transformer (commonly known as the primary and secondary coils, which, when combined, can induce the high-frequency current from the primary into the secondary coil through electromagnetic or capacitive coupling, similar to a transformer's action, hence the name high-frequency transformer, commonly used in heterodyne circuits) and two IF transformers, purchase four honeycomb coils (small) with 800 turns each and two identical coils with 400 turns each. If three IF transformers are required, add one each of the 800-turn and 400-turn coils. There are limitations on the diameter of these small coils, and the wire used is very fine, but they are generally available on the market.</p>
<p>First, use two of the 800-turn coils to create the high-frequency transformer. Then, use two more coils (one 800-turn and one 400-turn) to make the IF transformers, with the 400-turn coil as the primary and the 800-turn coil as the secondary.</p>
<p>Regardless of the number of turns, the inner diameter of all the coils is the same, so they can be strung together on a bakelite shaft as shown in the diagram. To prevent them from moving, use small pieces of cardboard to pad them or glue them in place. Drill a hole in one end of the wooden shaft to prepare for fixing them to the bakelite base with screws.</p>
<p>The two coils of the high-frequency transformer should be one centimeter apart, while the distance between the two coils of the IF transformer can be reduced to half a centimeter. The primary coil should be below the secondary coil, as shown in the diagram.</p>
<p>After the coils are fixed to the bakelite base, mount a 0.0005 microfarad capacitor directly above the secondary coil. Solder the two terminals of the capacitor to the terminals of the secondary coil, respectively.</p>
<p>As for the primary coil, one end can be directly connected to the plate of the associated vacuum tube, and the other end can be connected to the positive pole of the high voltage (45, 90, or 125 volts).</p>
<p>Do not forget that in superheterodyne circuits, the primary coil of the high-frequency transformer is accompanied by a capacitor between 0.00025 and 0.0005 microfarads. However, this capacitor is not needed in Hartley oscillator circuits.</p>
<p>The distance between these transformers should be at least twelve centimeters (from one central axis to another). If the IF transformers are too close, induction may occur, resulting in an unbearable squealing sound from the loudspeaker.</p>

<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>Ordinary light bulbs can be used as resistors. The advantages are that they can handle relatively large currents and are inexpensive. The disadvantages are that they take up too much space and are inconvenient to install. However, there is also a major drawback: their resistance value is not fixed and varies greatly depending on the current flowing through them. If space and resistance value are not critical, light bulbs can be used as excellent and inexpensive resistors. A detailed table of the current and resistance of ordinary light bulbs is provided below for reference.</p>
<p>In the table, V represents volts, W represents watts, and C.h. represents candlepower. The current is measured in amperes, and the resistance is measured in ohms. The fifth column, "Resistance When Filament is Cold," is an approximate number and not precise. If the light bulb is 220 volts, its current value is approximately half that of a 115-volt bulb with the same wattage, according to the table, and its resistance value is doubled. If a light bulb's wattage and voltage are known, its current under the specified voltage can be calculated. Divide the wattage by the voltage to obtain the current. Divide the voltage by the current to obtain the resistance.</p>

<p>— Jiang Zhiban</p>
<p>In recent years, the wireless broadcasting industry has developed extraordinarily. Most people purchase radios for entertainment purposes. In the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, almost all have AC power sources, so AC radios are becoming increasingly popular because of their ease of use and lower running costs. The AC radios sold on the market are almost all dominated by imported products. These radios have at least four tubes and up to twelve tubes, and all are beautifully decorated, with excellent selectivity and sensitivity, and loud and pleasant sound. However, in recent months, manufacturers have been competing fiercely in the market, reducing prices to increase sales. However, it is difficult to have both low price and high quality. Moreover, when manufactured in large quantities, shortcuts are inevitably taken, and inspection is not always precise. As a result of this sloppy approach, the radios are not only ineffective but also easily damaged. Ordinary people, greedy for temporary bargains, often suffer considerable losses. They do not know the contents of these radios or the key points for selecting them. Based on my experience, from the standpoint of economy and high efficiency, I dare to describe them in detail for the readers.</p>
<p>(1) Purpose of Radio Reception: Before purchasing a radio, you should first consider the purpose of radio reception. Is the purchased radio specifically for receiving broadcasts from this city or nearby, or is it for long-distance radio reception? Is it for personal or family entertainment, or is it for use in a large venue? Generally, people use the number of tubes as the standard for selection. However, a large number of tubes does not necessarily mean that it can receive distant broadcasts or produce loud sound. It depends on the quality of the manufacturer's design and the refinement of the construction. At the same time, we must also be aware of the current broadcasting situation in China. Except for Shanghai, where there are a mix of many small and medium-powered radio stations, and the large radio station of the Central Party Department in Nanjing, there are very few radio stations scattered throughout the country, with the largest power being only one kilowatt, and the distance is always more than a thousand miles away. If you prepare a machine that can receive broadcasts from all over the country, the cost may be beyond the means of a middle-class family. Moreover, except in special circumstances, the programs of distant radio stations are unlikely to arouse interest for entertainment purposes. Therefore, from an economic point of view, the purpose of a radio for family or personal entertainment should only be to receive local or nearby large radio stations satisfactorily. In the case of Shanghai's broadcasting situation, it is essential to be able to separate them clearly. A five-tube radio with a superheterodyne circuit seems suitable for meeting these conditions (most four-tube radios on the market are not good). For radio reception in the inland, where the distance to large radio stations is farther, a seven-tube radio can be used. As for the machines suitable for other radio reception conditions, readers can deduce them.</p>
<p>(2) Verification of Power Supply: This is the most important point to pay attention to when selecting imported AC radios. Most of the imported products are from the United States. Therefore, its design is also based on American standards, with the power transformer input line being 110 volts and 60 cycles. In most parts of our country, the AC power supply is 220 volts and 50 cycles (the French Concession in this city is 110 volts and 50 cycles). When selecting, be sure to pay attention to the voltage and frequency of the power supply to be used and compare it with the purchased equipment to ensure that they are completely the same. Also, check that the power transformer inside American radios has not been removed and forcibly converted to 220 volts. Because the frequency is different, it is also different for the design. This kind of forcibly modified power transformer is prone to heating. Overheating will cause it to break down. Ordinary people only ask whether the voltage matches and ignore the frequency check. It must be known that a well-designed transformer will never generate excessive heat. Purchasers, rather than resting for several minutes every hour of use, sacrificing some excellent programs, and inevitably damaging the machine frequently, should be more careful when selecting, pay a slightly higher price, and get a durable radio? (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Xun</p>
<p>Often, economic constraints are enough to dampen our interest in studying radio. Especially in China, which relies exclusively on imported goods, even the simplest materials must be purchased. However, if we can carefully examine, radio materials are everywhere. The following is an introduction to waste materials that can be utilized when manufacturing small-scale radios.</p>
<p>(1) Steel Refined Pots: Made of aluminum, soft, and easy to shape. Never rusts. And conductivity is close to copper. This type of waste pot can be used to make capacitors, metal shields, and aluminum electrodes for Electrolyte Rectifiers.</p>
<p>(2) Camera Film Cases and Toothpaste Tubes: Softer in quality, suitable for making fixed capacitors or fixed plates for variable capacitors.</p>
<p>(3) Cigarette Tin Foil: Easiest to find. Soft and easily torn, only suitable for making large-capacity fixed capacitors. Take it because it's thin.</p>
<p>(4) Toothpaste and Paint Bottle Caps: Used to make mineral cups and temporary screw caps (drill a hole first, then screw on the male screw).</p>
<p>(5) Thermos Bottles: The metal cup and metal cover on the upper part of the bottle shell are usually made of aluminum or nickel-plated copper. The former has the same properties and uses as (1). The latter is bright and strong, has good conductivity and does not rust, and can be used as a support frame for fixed ore or grid leaks. Spring sheet wiring post. Branch nail or rotating key for variable resistor. Lamp socket spring. Vacuum tube cap clip. And wiring return pieces, etc.</p>
<p>(6) Thin Iron Seal Film for Paper Cigarette Cans: The surface is coated with zinc and is elastic. Suitable for replacing the thin iron film on the earpiece.</p>
<p>(7) Transformer, Earpiece Loudspeaker's Thin Copper Wire: Rewound on a foreign thread wooden shaft, it can be used as a low-frequency choke coil.</p>
<p>(8) German silver wire on electric heaters can be used as a small ohm variable resistance Ebonite.</p>
<p>(9) Waste Round Dry Batteries: Connect the wire to the negative electrode and bury it in the mud or throw it into the bottom of the well to replace the ground wire. The positive screw removed can be used as a wiring post.</p>
<p>(10) Records: Made of hard rubber Ebonite. Can be used as the panel opening of the radio and other insulation boards (such as wire pipes, etc. When drilling holes, you can use a hot knife and scissors to cut it, and bend it in boiling water).</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Most Convenient Pointer Dial <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Old-fashioned pointer dials (Dials) are generally divided into one hundred grids, which have no meaning when used, only giving you an indication. The pointer dials of new radios are engraved with Kilo frequency numbers on the outside. In addition to giving you an indication when using them, they also let you know the frequency number of the radio station. This is of course much more convenient.</p>
<p>In fact, what we urgently want to know when receiving wireless broadcasts is not the frequency number or wavelength of the radio station, but the location and name of the radio station. In the past, when there were not many broadcasting stations, we could barely remember the names of each radio station after looking at the numbers on the pointer dial. Now, broadcasting stations are springing up everywhere. If you want to memorize them one by one, it is really too much trouble.</p>
<p>In order to improve the convenience of users, there is a design for a dial that indicates the name of the radio station. As shown in Figure P is a piece of black thick paper pasted on the back of the pointer dial, and L is a white chalk line drawn on the plastic board. After receiving the broadcast from a radio station, write its name on black paper in chalk. (It is best to draw a short line to match L.) When using, just pay attention to the position indicated by the white chalk line L, and you will know the name of the radio station being received. As shown in the figure, when the dial is at 35 degrees, it is the Shanghai Li Shude Hall Broadcasting Station.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Adjustment of Headphones <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Xun</p>
<p>The volume of one of my headphones increased because the bottom screw was not tightened. This is because Coulomb's law (Coulomb's law) states that the magnetic force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, that is, after the screw is loosened, the distance between the magnet and the iron film is reduced, and the attractive force between them is several times greater. That is, the volume is also large. If you think your headphones have low and weak sound, you can fill a piece of rubber of considerable thickness at the bottom of the magnet. You can try this whether it is new or old.</p>
<p>If your headphones have weak volume and suffer from distortion, the above method will not work. The diaphragm is too tight against the magnet and has reached its limit. Its amplitude is blocked and restricted by the magnet. And friction causes unpleasant and weak sounds. The adjustment method is to place a thick paper circle tightly against the inner wall of the earphone. Its height can be arbitrarily stretched to find the most appropriate distance between the diaphragm and the magnet. The tone and volume can be improved.</p>
<p>(The author also repaired a headphone with the second method, and the result was amazing)</p>

<p>— Xu Xiyu</p>
<p>I don’t know what the reason is. After a very detailed inspection in the radio material store, I know that almost most of the goods are enemy goods.</p>
<p>Indeed, the facts tell us that the price of enemy goods is cheaper than domestic and foreign goods, much cheaper, even only selling for three or four tenths of the price.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, for radio researchers, it is extremely important to prepare parts. Then, who doesn't want to find low prices and reduce individual burdens? Sure! Everyone has long been attracted by the low prices of enemy goods!</p>
<p>However, what will be our future achievements? Nine out of ten are disappointed, and excellent and satisfactory results are rarely found by us.</p>
<p>Besides, have we forgotten the national shame of September 18th and January 28th for the sake of studying radio? No! Never!</p>
<p>Ah! Fellow radio researchers, then you have to consider it when you buy parts!</p>

<p>The American Radio Corporation's recent situation is that the heat this year has broken the 60-year record. Radios are unclear due to the heat and need to be repaired. Only Stewart radios are not affected, because they are of excellent quality and use Saulman vacuum tubes, which are very convenient for summer radio reception and have loud sound. Now that new goods have arrived in Shanghai, welcome to visit. Those who want to buy must hurry up, because the selling price is low and there are not many goods available.</p>
<p>The Hueiers wireless radio is produced by a famous American manufacturer and has been sold worldwide for more than 20 years. In China, it is now managed by Hejin Company at No. 694 Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai. The company has specially held a Hueiers introduction discount week since the day before yesterday. Welcome all circles to visit and listen.</p>
<p>The radio repair department of Yada Company at No. 24 Nanjing Road has recently repaired many famous and expensive machines, each machine worth thousands of yuan. For example, a certain radio station’s RCA commercial short-wave radio is the only one in China. Its value can be imagined. If this machine is damaged, it must be shipped back to the original factory in the United States for repair. Now, after being repaired by Yada Company, the radio reception is as sensitive as ever. There is also an RCA No. 79 radio, originally priced at 4,500 yuan. It is said that only four of the same radios are sold in China, which is also a noble and rare machine. The automatic tuner of the machine is damaged, causing the remote control to lose its effectiveness. If the parts are ordered from the original RCA factory, it will take at least four months. Now, Yada Company has also perfectly repaired it, and its operation is flexible, no different from when it was newly purchased. The owner of the machine is very satisfied. The company has recently hired several consultant engineers, all of whom are wireless radio experts who have returned from studying in the United States. They have broad knowledge and very rich experience. By collecting opinions and ideas, the true, meticulous and complete equipment of its repair department and the strong strength of its engineering talents are not only second to none in the country, but also in East Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Memories of Enjoying the Cool <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The heat wave raged all day, and it wasn't until evening that I felt a little cooler; so I took a rattan chair and sat in the shade of the trees watching the children playing on the lawn, and couldn't help but recall my own childhood:</p>
<p>My childhood was like that of the children today; but the social situation was very different from today. All the sisters in the neighborhood were either reading "Women's Classic of Filial Piety" and "Women's Training" at home; or embroidering and needlework in high-rise buildings. In the evening, they also came to the lawn to enjoy the cool, telling stories of gods and monsters; singing popular folk songs. We boys also wanted to get in on the fun, but don't look at them being only around ten years old, the prevention of men and women was very strict, and they always chased us out; a few sharp-tongued girls even sang such a song to drive us away. "Boys are noisy; girls are noisy. Radishes don't match vegetables; turtles don't match robbers." After hearing this song, we had to walk away resentfully.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we couldn't stand them and thought of a way to retaliate. So, on a dark and starry night, while they were telling a story with relish, the most mischievous of us boys put on his father's black gown, painted black ink on his face, jumped up and down, and made a hissing sound in his mouth, rushing towards them. It was really effective! They were all so scared that they ran home, some shouting for help; some crying loudly. We got satisfactory revenge, and everyone clapped and cheered; and agreed not to reveal the news, lest our family members condemn us.</p>
<p>Girls are really easily frightened. The next day, after inquiring, these girls were all sick, and some families were busy inviting doctors; some were extending witch doctors to perform rituals, all saying that ghosts and monsters had appeared on the lawn and wanted to capture the souls of children. From then on, the lawn was quiet every night, and their traces were not seen; even we boys were locked at home by our parents and not allowed to go out.</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Story of a Watermelon <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>It’s hot! I can’t bear to say any more about "hot topics." Fortunately, watermelons can still bring some coolness, and the watermelon itself has a story that can be written down for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>This was told to me by my late grandfather, who had experienced the upheaval of the Jiawu Year, on a summer night twenty years ago when he was cooling off. Calling it a "story" is truly the most accurate description.</p>
<p>The content of this story is very simple, and it happened so many years ago, but it can still stir up feelings of regret in my heart even after twenty years. At the very least, I have been influenced by it!</p>
<p>Person A and Person B were casual neighbors "before the chaos." Because of the disparity in wealth, Person A often bullied Person B, sowing deep resentment. But when the chaos came, they became an inseparable pair of unfortunate companions. Like other refugees, they carried a portion of their belongings on their shoulders and backs, leading a life of wandering. The difference was that Person A had many silver ingots tied around his waist, while Person B laboriously dragged several watermelons!</p>
<p>It was summer, and the weather was very hot. The rivers and wells were clogged with corpses, and there was no water to drink! Although Person A possessed silver ingots, he had no opportunity to exchange them for water. Whether it was to take care of his own needs or to take revenge for past grudges, Person B very carefully and defensively ate the watermelons alone to quench his thirst. He was certainly aware that Person A was staring at the watermelons in a state of "not having a drop to spare," but no matter how much the latter pleaded, or even offered silver ingots to exchange for a watermelon, he showed absolutely no sign of yielding!</p>
<p>When Person B ate the last watermelon, Person A was unbearably thirsty and resorted to force to seize it, but he was at a disadvantage because Person A was accustomed to being pampered!</p>
<p>They parted ways. Before leaving, Person B generously threw Person A a piece of watermelon rind covered in urine and feces. This was like sweet rain and a precious treasure to Person A, who wiped it off roughly without hesitation and immediately swallowed it!</p>
<p>There are times when silver ingots are worthless! Watermelons are truly precious!</p>
<h3 id="e212">Jiangbei "Holland Water" <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>This summer is so hot, exceeding one hundred degrees. Even the elderly, over eighty years old, say they have never seen anything like it. Now, although there have been several showers, the river levels have not returned to what they were before. Therefore, in the inland areas, the drinking water for residents is still filthy and unbearable. Although this concerns the water conservancy of the entire county and cannot be easily resolved, public hygiene is not something the local authorities pay attention to. I will talk about something very small and ask, who would be willing to study it? I have no name for this thing, so I will tentatively call it "Jiangbei Holland Water."</p>
<p>I think this kind of "Jiangbei Holland Water" is not unique to our Jiading area, because people from Jiangbei can go everywhere. Therefore, there must be peddlers of this kind everywhere! You can see them at street corners, men carrying a shoulder pole with a round tray on top. On the tray is a horizontal bar that can rotate. When they flick it with their hand, you can see what line it lands on, and you can get that item. Before, they used sugar figurines to attract people. Now, they are also good at seizing opportunities, using small gourd-shaped glass bottles, no more than three inches long. I heard that they first fill them with cold water, then add a small amount of saccharin, and then mix in various colorings. Therefore, the surface looks very pleasing to the eye. There are at least ten or more children surrounding this shoulder pole. Even elderly women and younger children from Jiangbei hold this tray and use this red and green water as a target. You! Think about it, is it hygienic or harmful for children to drink this in their stomachs? That is why I wrote about it, for people to study!</p>
<p>One day, a friend's son, only eight or nine years old, said that he drank a bottle of Holland Water from this Jiangbei man's tray, and that night, his stomach started to hurt. He cried out all night and has not recovered. I dare not say for sure if this is the reason, but because the weather is so dry and there has not been rain for more than a month, the rivers are dry and shallow, and the drinking water situation is already very dangerous. If the parents of children are not careful about this kind of Holland Water, oh! I am afraid that sickness enters through the mouth, all from a small glass bottle.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Simple Ways to Beat the Summer Heat <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— An Ying</p>
<p>I often have to put on a little powder. To say that putting on a little powder also has to do with social circumstances may seem like a joke, but that's the reality. I think that when you enter society, you often have to put on a little powder. Perhaps this is the misery of modern urban women. But let's not get sidetracked. Let’s just say that I know that summer has arrived because I have to put on a little powder.</p>
<p>If you can't put on powder or can't put it on well, it's because it's summer, and sweat is being excreted from the pores of your face. This is what women find troublesome, putting on powder in the summer.</p>
<p>But now I don't want to say much about putting on powder in the summer, I want to talk about my ways to beat the summer heat.</p>
<p>My ways to beat the summer heat are really very simple:</p>
<p>If I have some spare money in my pocket, I go to the ice cream shop to drink a cup or two of shaved ice, or a serving or two of ice cream.</p>
<p>When I have too much time, I go to the Rongguang Theater after lunch and sit there until dusk. The admission ticket for Rongguang is thirty cents. The theater has air conditioning, so you can watch continuously or take a nap. Once you buy a ticket, you can sit there until you want to leave, or until eleven o'clock at night. Going to the movie theater to beat the summer heat is probably a method I invented.</p>
<p>If I could take a small boat to Huangpu River, I know that would also be a good way to beat the summer heat, but I am afraid of the boat capsizing and falling into the water, so I often go to the dock and stand for an hour or two. Standing on the dock to enjoy the river breeze and cool off is also a good way to beat the summer heat?</p>
<p>When there is really no other way, I stroll around in the small courtyard, or play the piano for some time. I am a great lover of music, and playing a sad piece of music can really help me get rid of some of the heat and sweat.</p>
<p>My ways to beat the summer heat are not brilliant. For me, summer is ultimately a season of misery.</p>

<p>Dark clouds were chasing closely behind, and as soon as I stepped into the Yating Pavilion, the rain came down, thick and heavy, like thousands of arrows shooting down from mid-air, stirring up mist and spreading out, with countless small circles crowding and floating on the surface of the pond. Ashan hugged her leather dog and huddled in the corner of the pavilion, very well-behaved, her little eyes staring at each raindrop like an arrow. "Whish whish whish..." The brave and strong sound of the rain. A frog squatted on a large lotus leaf, silently, letting the rain pour down on it, pour down on it.</p>
<p>A gust of wind tousled Ying's hair, a gust of wind blew off my straw hat: "What an annoying wind!" However, we liked having this rainstorm. In the sky, a pile of dark clouds was pushed away by a pile of white clouds, and the rain stopped. When the white clouds dispersed, a blue color filled the sky, and the first ray of sunlight shone on the frog's back, as if it were happy. "Croak, croak, croak" it cried. The trees were revitalized and particularly energetic, just enduring the attack of the storm, and now receiving the cleansing of the sunlight, gaining a new life.</p>
<p>The whole garden was a lush green, with patches of red where the rain had scattered the monthly roses. Everything was awakened!</p>
<p>"Ying, do you love this new world?"</p>
<p>"But I'm also afraid of that moment of the storm!"</p>
<p>"Why be afraid of that little bit? It's a necessary process."</p>
<p>Ying led Ashan, walking by my side, talking, with a pure heart. On the carpet-like lawn, my feet sank into the water, like a sponge in a basin. Ashan threw the leather dog into a puddle, shouting, "Doggy drinks water, doggy drinks water," her innocent and ignorant appearance was enough to make people laugh.</p>
<p>The bar was empty, the white-clothed waiter with a pointy chin was standing there blankly, the ashtrays were dozing off on the white tablecloth, and not one of the usual high-class people could be found. Lonely, the carnations in the flower vase drooped their heads. Eaves dripping tears, sycamores dripping tears, rose vines dripping tears, the despair of the end of the century.</p>
<p>However, this park after the rain was awakened, filled with vitality, new life.</p>

<p>The Xujiahui Observatory was established only a little over sixty years ago, but this year's heat has exceeded the record of any year in the observatory's past. Regarding odes to heat, although I have read quite a few articles recently, none have been convincing or satisfying. Yesterday I read Huang Zhongze's "Song of Suffering in the Heat of Summer" and immediately transcribed it below: The fiery wheel hangs high in the sky, shining down on the earth, creating surface smoke; the dark green canopy withers and dies, in which the cicadas chirp in chorus. I unroll a bamboo mat in the north window, and after a nap, my sweat seems to float my body up...</p>
<p>There is no need to copy any further below. Just the line "after a nap, my sweat seems to float my body up" is already an extremely fine and realistic line. Of course, sweat will not accumulate so much that it can actually float a body up, but we should pay attention to the extremely vivid word "seems." Even if it doesn't float up, it almost floats up!</p>

<p>The large blades of the electric fan spin wildly, and the waiters in plain clothes bustle back and forth like bees. Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola, the eye-catching billboards shine brightly. The descriptive words for cocoa, vanilla, orange, mango, and ice cream, and the names for lemon, red bean, fruit syrup, grape juice, and shaved ice are spat out at the mouth and written on paper. A wheat straw is held in cherry lips and sucked on, and soda bubbles dance in tall glass cups. The doorboy has not a moment of leisure, batches of guests leave, and pairs of lovers enter to welcome the new.</p>

<p>"Ice" is large, written on a wooden sign: large cup one hundred and twenty, medium cup eighty, small cup..., and there is also an oval wooden barrel painted red with "Beijing (or Tianjin) Sour Plum Soup," with the price list listed in the same way. Several ordinary tables are covered with white cloth, and the different cups are neatly inverted on the basins, forming a natural pattern. Drinkers in long gowns and customers in short clothes often feel the narrowness of the seats due to overcrowding.</p>

<p>In the shade of the streets and roadsides, an ice cream machine is placed by the foot, and old enamel basins filled with water contain thick, tall, glass cups. The old peddler, although wearing a cloth short shirt, does not button the entire row of buttons, and a tuft of hair is lined on his purplish-black belly. Beads of sweat drip from his forehead, but his mouth shouts wildly: "Top-notch, only ten cents!" Laborers, coolies, and street children surround his stall, with happy smiles floating on their faces, slowly enjoying the cheap ice cream.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Qingdao in Summer <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Nangongsheng</p>
<p>During these dog days of summer, when the scorching sun is oppressive and the heat reaches over one hundred degrees, everyone wants to find a summer resort to pass the sweltering weather. Although Mogan Mountain and Lushan are cool, because they are high in the mountains, the enjoyment of all material comforts is relatively inconvenient, so it is far better to go to Qingdao for summering, which is more convenient and suitable.</p>
<p>Qingdao is a peninsula along the coast, surrounded by sea on three sides and land on one side. All year round, it is warmed by the sea breeze, which regulates the climate, so in summer it becomes an excellent summer resort.</p>
<p>Since Qingdao was leased to and operated by Germany, after the changes of the European War, it was recovered from the hands of Japan and placed under the political control of our country. During these twenty years of experience, all the construction has gradually become complete. Especially because Qingdao is a summer resort area, the facilities for summering are becoming more and more perfect. There is Huiquan Bathing Beach, Huiquan Hotel and Qingdao Hotel along the coast, the first to fifth parks, wide sandy beaches, the Qingdao Cafe for dancing, and everything else, all of which are enough for summerers to enjoy supreme comfort and coolness.</p>
<p>In the summer, the several hotels along the coast of Qingdao are filled with tourists who come to escape the summer heat. In the evening, strolling on the sandy beach by the sea, enjoying the sea breeze, is such a happy and refreshing experience. Huiquan Bathing Beach can be considered one of the best bathing beaches in the country. There is a bathing beach that can accommodate thousands of bathers, a sandy beach that stretches for several miles, and fully complete facilities. In the summer, when the sun sets, you can see thousands of bathers in the sea undergoing baptism. Men, women, old, young, pretty, ugly, Europeans, Americans, Japanese, Indians, Chinese, it can be said to be an international human race exhibition, all wearing beautiful and white bathing suits, rippling in the sea, sitting and lying on the sandy beach, as if there were no summer in the world.</p>
<p>The vastness of the First Park can be said to be beyond people's expectations, with a site of more than a thousand acres, containing mountains and plains. The park has ancient trees that can be embraced, thousands of cherry blossoms, neat short cypresses, winding mountain paths, and flat sandy roads. In this sleepy season, it is common to see many cars traveling through the park, winding up the mountain road, covered by the shade of the trees, and truly not knowing that there is a summer with temperatures over one hundred degrees. Therefore, people who escape the summer heat in Qingdao cannot help but be happy and forget to return.</p>
<p>The temperature in Qingdao in summer, at noon, is at most eighty degrees, but in the evening it is between sixty and seventy degrees. It does not have the low temperatures of Mogan Mountain and Lushan, nor the high heat of Beiping and Hankou. It is exactly a suitable place to escape the summer heat. It is only when you see the Japanese shops on Liaocheng Road, the towering Japanese Loyal Soul Monument, and the Japanese Shrine where Japanese people pay their respects, that you can think of the ambitions of schemers for Qingdao. People who come to escape the summer heat should not only know that Qingdao is a good place to escape the summer heat, but also forget the danger of Qingdao. I am afraid that in a few years, you will not be allowed to come to Qingdao to escape the summer heat, and it will become the second of the four northeastern provinces.</p>

<p>Financial Silver Prices Rise Repeatedly</p>
<h3 id="e219">Spot Gold Drops Another 3.4 Yuan <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>American Silver Certificates Show Weakness on the Market</p>
<p>Buying Activities Result in Continued Stability</p>
<p>The gold market is under pressure from silver prices, and sentiment is weak. Spot prices have fallen steadily, but volume has increased sharply, and selling pressure is relatively weak, making rebounds inevitable. Although the market suffered a sharp drop yesterday due to rumors about American silver certificates, the result was still relatively stable. Early in the morning, due to the continued rise in overseas silver markets, the forward silver price on the Metal Exchange rose by 0.3 to 0.47 percent. The price of spot gold in London rose by one penny, exchange rates lengthened slightly, American cotton contracted by three pounds, and American wheat and stocks both fluctuated. With silver prices only rising and not falling, it is difficult to boost market sentiment. Off-exchange trading immediately fell to 75.6 yuan. After 5 yuan was broken, market sentiment became even weaker, with supply exceeding demand. Although the market was stable after opening, Reuters suddenly reported that US Senator Thomas's request to promptly issue new silver currency had been answered by the Treasury Department. The Treasury Secretary stated that the issuance of silver certificates would be brought forward as much as possible, with 1,204,000 "one-dollar" silver certificates and 11,640,000 "five-dollar" certificates about to be printed. "Ten-dollar" certificates will be issued next week or the week after, "twenty-dollar" certificates are scheduled for early September, and "one-hundred-dollar" certificates are scheduled for mid-October, all of which will be issued successively. It was also said that silver would be purchased continuously and issued permanently, causing great uncertainty and triggering a price decline. The foreign exchange market also loosened accordingly, with a rapid downward trend. However, because the gold market had been falling for many days in a row, volume had increased significantly, and selling pressure was relatively weak. After a general influx of buying from big players at low prices, there were also rumors that the central bank had intervened in cash. The price rose again after falling, and gradually pulled up. Bank appetites were strong, and after that, Chinese merchants also developed an appetite for buying, and Cantonese merchants even came to cover their short positions. Both the foreign exchange and gold markets became tight. Although there was some fluctuation in between, buying sentiment recovered, and the market was particularly firm at noon. In the afternoon, bank appetite remained strong, and the market was particularly firm, but sentiment appeared slightly uncertain. Sources of supply frequently appeared at high prices. Rumors from Bombay reported a slight deterioration. General sellers were unwilling to give in, and gold prices fell once again, but Cantonese merchants continued to buy, and there was still residual buying power, and the price was pulled up again. Lacking special changes, trading was still active throughout the day, and arbitrage was particularly active. Guest merchants also bought, allowing the gold market to be maintained. The carry-over premium rose to around one yuan. Due to the fall in gold prices, spot sources remained sluggish. The daily market conditions will be recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 973.8 yuan, a decrease of 6.2 yuan compared to the previous closing. Spot goods opened at 4 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling, 4 pence, 3125 for British currency, 34.3125 yuan for American currency, and Zhengjin offering 625 for November American dollars. Dingkang, Yuanmaoyongjin, and others offered up to 4.6 yuan. Reuters reported that the US Treasury Secretary indicated immediate issuance of silver certificates. Huixiang, Qianchangxiang, Zhaofengchang, Yifengyong, Fuyu, and Fuxingyong came to sell, causing a price decline to 2 yuan. It was learned in advance that HSBC's listing increased by 125 for British currency and 25 for American currency. McCallie leveled out at 6875 for November American dollars. Zhentai, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Dafayong, Shunmao, Hengyu, Yuqingyong, and Fuxingyong took delivery at low prices, rising to 3.5 yuan. Yuanmaoyong divested, falling to 2.5 yuan, but Fuxingyong, Yuqingyong, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Yicheng, Dingtai, Zhaofengchang, Hengxing, and the Dalian gang all advanced, and Zhejiang offered half a yuan for October American dollars, so it returned to good at 5.5 yuan. Although Fuan and Daxingyong sold to 4.5 yuan, Fuxingyong and Zhaofengchang still had appetites for delivery at this time, and the price still pulled up. And when Citibank released 25 for August American dollars, Fuan, Dadecheng, and Yuanmaoyong sold off, falling to 3.5 yuan. Buying was still active, and Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Dafengheng, and others took delivery, rising to 5 yuan again. Shengda and Hengxing even came to buy strongly, and the internal market tightened again. In addition, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanheng, Yongli, Yuanshengyong, and others also came to buy, rising to 6.8 yuan. Fuyu and Yicheng divested, causing a market correction. The noon close was 976.4 yuan, and spot goods were auctioned at 6.8 yuan. The market was more stable after closing.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 975.9 yuan, with spot goods opening at 6.1 yuan. Youli offered 4375 for October American dollars and 5625 for November. Fuxingyong, Yongli, Shunli, Wanxing, and Yifengyong came to advance, gradually rising to 7.1 yuan. Yuanshengyong and Fuyu divested at high prices and went downstream. A telegram from Bombay reported an increase of one anna, and rumors in the market were unfavorable. Bank appetite was stagnant. Dingkang, Qianchangxiang, Hengxing, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Daxingyong, Yuanmaoyong, and others sold strongly. Although Shengda advanced, it still fell to 4.9 yuan. Shengda's further advance was unsuccessful, and the price was coaxed up again. Yuqingyong, Dafayong, Shunmao, Dingkang, the Dalian gang, and others took delivery together, and the price returned to 6.8 yuan. The closing price was 976.6 yuan. After the market closed, Tianfengyong, Fuyu, and Hengxingyuan slightly sold and were relatively weak. Spot goods were auctioned at 6.5 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 977.1 yuan and the lowest price was 972 yuan, a fluctuation of 5.1 yuan. The result was a decrease of 3.4 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on HSBC's listing, with American currency increasing by 25 to 33.875 yuan, corresponding to a gold price of 1,021.4 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 45 yuan weaker, which was about 4 yuan less than the previous closing. The book price for this month was 976 yuan, and for September it was 976 yuan. The morning replenishment was 976 yuan, and the afternoon replenishment was 977 yuan. The price of red gold was estimated at 986.8 yuan, an increase of about 13 yuan. Due to the continued low gold price, the supply of spot goods was interrupted, and there were no transactions. Tianjin goods were priced at about 13 yuan higher, because the carry-over trend was stable. Carry-over from Dadecheng to Qianchangxiang was 21 pieces, 5 jiao, Yingfenghang to Fuxingyong was 70 pieces, 9 jiao. Although there were rumors that the central bank had intervened in cash, it was not confirmed. There are currently 6,997 August strips remaining, with a total of four long positions and twelve short positions. The public order for the day was 210 strips for liquidation.</p>
<p>In-market trading was balanced, but buying sentiment was stronger. The volume continued to increase. In summary, Wanxing, Shunli, Hengyu, Yuqingyong, Shunmao, Yuanyi, Dafengheng, Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, Dachangxiang, Futaiheng, Fuan, Tongtaichang, Shengda, Hengxing, and others were on the buying side. Huixiang, Yuanmaoyong, Yicheng, Hongkangyong, Ruikang, Tongfenghang, Shenkangyuankangxiang, Huiyuan, Hongxing, Tianfeng, Zhengchang, Yuanchangyong, Tianfengyong, Hengxingyuan, and Chunyuanyong, Qianchangxiang, and others were on the selling side. Yuanshengyong, Yongli, Yifengyong, Daxingyong, Fuchang, Yuanyi, Hengtai, Yuanheng, and Zhaofengchang were first in and then out. Fuxingyong, Fuyu, and Dadecheng were first out and then in. The Dalian gang and Wanxing did a total of over 3,100 strips, taking in about 1,900 strips. Shunli did a total of about 1,900 strips, taking in about 1,100 strips. The Cantonese Shengda advanced over 300 strips, and Hengxing advanced about 600 strips, selling about 100 strips. September's volume totaled 43,358 strips, with a total of 39 long positions and 64 short positions. The number of transactions on that day was 4,2,938 strips in the morning and 16,310 strips in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The financial market in the first three or four days of this week seemed to be better than last month in terms of silver and money business conditions. The situation was quite active, only that the poor harvests of agricultural products in various villages greatly affected the market sentiment. The interbank lending rate in the morning and afternoon markets remained at 7%, although it was the same as the previous few days, most aspects of the situation have slightly improved. Half of the reason is that the summer harvest will gradually enter the market, and the flow of urban goods is no longer as stagnant as in the past. The initial transaction volume of interbank transfers was only two or three tenths, and then it was still blank. The transaction volume of discounted bills was more than 4.2 million in the morning market, and more than 400,000 in new transactions. The transaction volume in the afternoon market was more than 200,000. The transaction volume in the small general meeting was more than 300,000. The amount of banknotes recovered and issued was more than 2.1 million. The transaction volume of foreign mortgages was more than 500,000 taken back and more than 1.2 million newly made. The source of customers was 200,000, and the outgoing volume was 150,000. Bank collections: foreign banks collected more than 200,000 in bill funds and more than 4.67 million in various goods, foreign exchange mortgages, and miscellaneous funds. 500,000 entered the warehouse. Chinese banks collected more than 3.1 million in bill funds and more than 4.78 million in various goods, foreign exchange, and miscellaneous funds. 600,000 left the warehouse. Japanese banks collected more than 2.1 million in bill funds and more than 3.78 million in various miscellaneous funds. 400,000 left the warehouse. Money shops collected more than 49 million in foreign public bills and more than 7.22 million in foreign transfer funds, and more than 600,000 in various remittances, receiving 560,000 in cash. In addition, the total amount of clearing at the local bill exchange on the 3rd was 8,740,131.8 silver dollars, including 5,271,916.8 silver dollars and 3,468,215 silver dollars for remittances.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver coins remained unchanged in the morning market at 836 yuan, and rose by 1 yuan in the afternoon market to 837 yuan. The transaction volume was 2,000 jiao in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market.

The transaction volume was 30,544 strings of wen, with a total price of 9,200 silver dollars.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Bond Market Suddenly Sees Strong Selling Pressure <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Falling by 1 or 2 Jiao to Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, suddenly because the market was rumored to be rife with banditry in Fujian Province, people's hearts suddenly became empty, fearing the spread of communism, the sellers were extremely eager, and in addition, the sale of No. 4 was still very enthusiastic. Although No. 46 absorbed it, it only needed 20 rolls, so the market price could not be maintained. Changes in the situation were the key to the rise and fall of the market price, and with the implementation of the savings law, the banking community has not yet been able to agree, or there is still room for accommodation. Moreover, with the increasingly bad news in the afternoon, the prospects of the market price have been hit by this, and it has not been able to recover for the time being. Many retail investors are crowded with bulls, fearing that they still want to get out. Yesterday's experience: the market was flat before opening and firm afterwards. The sale of No. 4 was slightly rare. The second round of the layoff was still slightly up by 2 or 3 jiao. The troop reduction was due to the sellers' rush, and the market price went from high to low, and after that, everyone felt depressed. No. 4 sold 20 rolls, and No. 46 absorbed as much as possible, which can be said to be evenly matched. After that, it fell more and more sharply. The unified salt tax fell sharply by about 1 yuan. Only the forward Sixth firm was rarely shorted and remained stable as before. As a result, the market price fell by 1 or 2 jiao to about 1 yuan. Among them, only the forward Sixth was firm, and the forward Sixth rose by 5 fen. 96 was also good by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was 18,060,000 yuan. The result of the rise and fall is compared and listed on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<p>New Fung Yuen report: Yesterday (2nd), the New York stock market experienced minimal fluctuations. It opened slightly higher, then fell, and then rose again at the close. As a result, there was not much change from the previous day. Traders were waiting quietly for the development of the German situation and were all observing. The death of President Hindenburg had no impact on the market, because this matter had already been fully discounted. Various stocks on the small exchange fell by a few jiao. Bonds were slightly higher, with the most speculative ones rising the most. US government bonds were firm, while European government bonds fluctuated due to the death of President Hindenburg. However, German government bonds did not change much. Wheat futures were mixed and tired due to bulls taking profits, but later turned flat at the close due to private harvest estimates favoring the bulls. The total daily trading volume was 560,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market, which had risen for four consecutive days, is now showing signs of weakening again. However, spot yarn sales are still smooth, and northern procurement continues unabated, so people's hearts are still strong. Moreover, spot yarn inventory has been significantly reduced compared to before. In this regard, the market is not likely to fall quickly. However, the amount of foreign merchants selling out still has no intention of buying back, which has a great impact on the surface of the market, and the price of forward marked yarn is too high, so there are more short sellers.</p>

<p>The marked yarn market opened in the morning with a flat market sentiment and a bleak situation. There were not many buyers in the market. US cotton rose slightly by three to five pounds. In addition, some bulls closed out and were tired. Each month fell by seven or eight jiao. When it was auctioned to the closing of the third session, it was heard that spot yarn sales were still good, and Runkang bought a lot again, which felt slightly back up. As a result, each month fell by five or six jiao. The transaction statistics were 21,500 bales. It was found that Jifeng sold 550 bales, Dafu 1,450 bales, Dafeng 1,250 bales, Hui Kang 500 bales, Dafu 600 bales, Yuanfeng 750 bales, Renfeng 1,350 bales, Yuantai 750 bales, and Xinhua 700 bales. Tongji bought 450 bales, Yudda 400 bales, Yuanda 400 bales, Shenji 1,500 bales, Taichang 600 bales, Changfeng 900 bales, Runkang 2,450 bales, and Hengchang 600 bales.

<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that the statistics of each gang's purchases throughout the day were 1,100 bales. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The buyers of each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Northern Gang 70 Xuzhou 25 Haizhou 125 Jiangxi 30 Tianjin 25</p>

<p>The cotton market has weakened because the current cotton sales market is not prosperous, and the factory is selling Chen cotton, and the market is becoming more and more loose. The situation of US cotton is that the German political news is conducive to the short side, which makes people's hearts even weaker. As for the new cotton production, although the weather is dry, there is no major obstacle at present, and the manufacturers have no intention of buying. However, the amount absorbed by the buyers is firmly held and not released, and we must wait for the US cotton estimate to be released on the 8th. It is said that there will be a fluctuation.</p>

<p>The marked cotton market opened weakly in the previous market due to more sellers and bad news about US cotton, which fell slightly by several pounds, making people's hearts even weaker. Moreover, after a certain factory sold a large batch of Chen cotton the previous day, the chips on the surface of the market were unusually loose. The demand for current cotton in the market was deserted, so the situation was scattered. Chen cotton fell by 2 jiao, and new cotton fell by 1 jiao to 1.5 jiao. January rebounded by 5 fen. The transaction statistics were 55,100 dan. It was found that the sellers were Dafu 2,500 dan, Tongji 1,800 dan, Hengyi 2,300 dan, Daji 1,100 dan, Mingde 1,500 dan, Hui Kang 4,200 dan, Gengfeng 5,800 dan, Yuande 1,500 dan, Changfeng 3,600 dan, Xinheng 1,000 dan, and Yuanxingchang 2,900 dan.

<p>Yesterday, US cotton was firm at first due to bad weather, but was offset by German political news favoring sellers. Later, it improved slightly due to some short covering. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, and futures fell by three to four pounds. British cotton futures rose by one point. Indian cotton rose at first due to broker purchases, but returned due to retail sales. As a result, Pingar and Omar rose by half a rupee, and Bairoki rose by one rupee.

<p>Yesterday, the market resumed trading in the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was extremely chaotic. After the opening in the morning, it rose at first due to short covering, and then some bulls returned, and then it returned by 35 fen. In the afternoon, it was bought by inland and northern and internal and external hoarding households, and the market rose sharply again. The sharpness of the rising wind was no less than the sharpness of the previous day. The near month once surged by more than 2 jiao. Later, some bulls returned, and the market closed slightly flat. The closing price was 1 jiao and 8 fen for the current month, 1 jiao and 5 fen for the next month, 9 fen for October, 6 fen for November, and 1 jiao for December. Spot wheat was quoted up by about 1 jiao. Each factory had a greedy buying appetite. The total daily transaction volume was more than 60,000 bags. The price of high-carriage wheat was 3 yuan, 8 jiao, 34 fen. The market is still optimistic in the later market. The grain exchange resumed trading in the morning and afternoon sessions yesterday. Two sessions were opened in the morning and four sessions in the afternoon, which has been handled as usual.</p>

<p>Saigon Rice Opens for Sale at 11 Yuan for the First Time</p>
<p>Small Jiao Surpasses Large Triangle and Ke Xian Surpasses 1 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of foreign Ke Xian rice was that inland droughts had become a reality, and the number of people going to Shanghai for procurement was increasing. The hoarders in this street, in view of the continuous disasters and the soaring prices of flour and wheat, went to the market to compete for foreign Ke Xian rice. With the competition between the inland and this street hoarders, the market immediately improved. Small Jiao's inventory was in short supply and the production price was high, which attracted the attention of the hoarders. The opening price was 8 yuan and 8 jiao, and then gradually rose. In the later market, it opened to 9 yuan and 1 jiao, which continued to rise by 3 jiao compared to the previous market. After the machine-milled Ke Xian rice was affected by the Saigon rice arriving in Shanghai, the market price had gradually relaxed due to the continuous upstream supply. Yesterday, after the rise of Small Jiao, it was snatched up by the inland, and the price also rose by 1 jiao. The whole city bought 4,000 bags of Small Jiao from this street, and the inland bought more than 7,000 bags of machine-milled Ke Xian rice. After the first two batches of foreign rice orders arrived in Shanghai, people's hearts were slightly calmed, but for various reasons, samples have not been fully released. It is heard that after our country's drought, the production price has gradually increased. A few days ago, Hengyi Foreign Bank ordered 2,000 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice, delivered at the place of production, plus expenses, taxes, etc., and the price opened at 4 yuan, 1 jiao, 2 fen. Yesterday, the same product was quoted at 4 yuan, 3 jiao, 8 fen, which has increased by 2 jiao, 6 fen. Therefore, people's hearts are unanimously upward. A hundred bags of No. 1 Saigon, which arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, were opened for trial on the market, and the price was 11 yuan. This price can make a profit according to the cost, but this price of 11 yuan has been magnified by 3 or 4 jiao in the market, because the importers also purchased a batch of Annam sugar (price 11 yuan, 7 jiao) and used this to compete with Saigon, so they are willing to let go of the price. If the next batch of confirmed orders arrive, or the previous arrivals are sold at a discounted price, then the 11 yuan Saigon may not be able to stand firm.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang was Nos. 24 and 25 (about 4,000 shi of goods). The sales market was sluggish at first, and the situation continued to fall. Fortunately, a few more customers came to the market, and there was a lot of momentum. As the Qingdao Gang came forward to purchase, 150 bags of Qingpu special goods, the market color was restored and turned around, and it was slightly tightened. As a result, the former and the latter reflected each other and became a stable situation. Therefore, the prices of japonica rice such as Chang Gang, Su Tong, and South Port, and late rice such as Qing Jiao, Song Si, and West Lian did not rise or fall much. Du Yangjian was also fixed, and only Yin Yuan, which was out of stock due to the change of Yuan, had sales, and was able to stand out by 2 jiao and 1. The general trend of Pudong special japonica rice was similar to yesterday, and the price opened at 11 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of more than 10 numbers in Hetao and other places. The transaction of white japonica rice was sluggish and tired in the early market, but the store's buying appetite turned active in the afternoon market, resulting in a flat price. The arrival of Dongxin japonica rice was abundant, and the price was settled. There was little arrival of Baiyuan, and the buying appetite was active, adding 2 or 3 jiao. Yang Dufu Jian had a good remaining buying appetite and was also close to a jiao. The sales of Ke Jian were quite prosperous, adding 1 or 2 jiao.</p>

<p>The soybean market was sluggish because the cake sales were light and the factories' soybean buying appetite was not active, resulting in a depressed mood. Moreover, the goods households took advantage of the high price and cheap sale, so the Yingzhou beans sold by the factory fell by 2 jiao within 3 days. Yesterday's transaction was 56 cars, and the price was 3 yuan and 05 fen to 3 yuan. The scattered households on this street went to each car about 34 cars of soybeans. The arrival and sales of new soybeans were evenly matched, and the market was slightly tight.

<p>The price of rayon has reached its peak and has been quite firm in recent days. Each silk factory has inventory, and those who currently have enough for application are all watching, so transactions are deserted. Each of the Ke Lu Hang Shao gangs has made purchases, but the quantity is not large.</p>

The selling price was unchanged from the previous day. The sales of green tea such as Needle Eyebrow and Gongxi were slightly active, but the market was unanimously trending down. In addition, Pingshui Pearl Tea, American and French estates both have telegram demands, and the market is also brewing to launch.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Some Words on Mr. Cao's Proposal of "A Few Small Problems of the People's Language" <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Cao Juren raised a few small problems regarding the people's language in the Free Talk section, inviting former colleagues of the National Language Research Society and gentlemen concerned about language issues to discuss them. After reading this letter, I cannot help but chatter again.</p>
<p>I must declare first that I am not a colleague of the National Language Research Society, nor am I one concerned about language issues. I am one who is scolded as having feudal thoughts, but I am ultimately a member of the masses, and I will speak a few words in the capacity of the masses.</p>
<p>Many articles on the people's language have been published in the supplement, but they are mostly empty talk, lacking practical solutions for the people's language. Therefore, we no longer see the editor publishing such articles. Now, seeing Mr. Cao raise a few small problems about the people's language, I cannot help but be eager to try, like Feng Fu encountering a tiger.</p>
<p>In Mr. Cao's letter, what I agree with most are the two sentences: "The issue of the people's language is all about the clamor of gongs and drums, but no official appears on the stage." Indeed, having advocated for the masses, please let a few writers who advocate for the people's language first create a few standard texts in the people's language, so that everyone can read and admire them. Relying solely on ideals in the mind and using the attitude of a village woman scolding in the streets is useless. The result is only showing off and considering it a successful event, achieving the goal. What contribution does this make to the masses? What real benefits are there?</p>
<p>Now, I will not discuss the five small problems raised by Mr. Cao. In addition to the five small problems raised by Mr. Cao, I will first raise an even smaller problem, which is that I do not understand the recently loudly advocated people's language at all. What exactly are people advocating for now, the people's language or the people's writing, or writing within it, or advocating the people's writing while the language is also within it?</p>
<p>Therefore, the first question I raise is, should the people's language and the people's writing be discussed together, or should they be discussed separately?</p>
<p>If we talk about the people's writing, I have one opinion first. The so-called people's writing must naturally consider the lower classes of society in order to be called the people's writing and to enable the masses of the lower classes to speak, understand, and write. However, alas, most of the masses in our country are illiterate, friends who do not recognize a single character. The literate population in our country is only a little over ten percent, while the illiterate population is more than eighty percent. (Please forgive me for not having accurate statistics here, but I heard others say so.) And the so-called little over ten percent are the intellectual minority among the masses. If we talk about the people's writing in this situation, the result will still be a few intellectuals playing with words, showing off their skills, while the so-called masses are still being deceived. Therefore, to use the people's writing, the fundamental problem lies in popularizing education first. If education is not popularized, no matter what you advocate, the so-called masses will still be as bewildered as Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden for the first time.</p>
<p>If we talk about the people's language, naturally there will be a few experts in the study of the national language who will talk about it in a coherent and authentic manner, and it is not necessary for me, an outsider, to say too much. However, from my feudal-minded perspective, the method of adopting the people's language cannot succeed by picking a sentence here and a sentence there. It must also designate a local dialect as the standard. Assuming that the Beijing dialect is taken as the standard, because the Beijing dialect is the most common, if we can do our best to promote and implement it, no matter how "official" the language may be, over time, we will naturally achieve the result of being able to speak, hear, and write it. If we say that because it is the people's language, we go to the masses to find it, it is like building a house and asking passersby for advice, which will not be completed in three years, and we will never find any reason.</p>
<p>The above is the argument for discussing the people's language and the people's writing separately. If we say that the people's language requires the ability to write, speak, and hear, then the ability to speak must mean the ability to write, and the ability to write must mean the ability to hear. It seems unnecessary to discuss them separately, but writing and language are still somewhat different. One is used with the mouth and ears, and the other is used with the hands and eyes. According to the current situation, there is still a need to discuss them separately. Therefore, my opinion is:</p>
<p>First, it is necessary to popularize education, so that the masses can first learn several hundred to a thousand characters, so that there is a way to start.</p>
<p>Second, it is necessary to first designate a local dialect as the standard, which is easier to start. The dialect cannot be found from the lower classes of society.</p>
<p>These are the author's opinions. What do the readers think?</p>
<h3 id="e242">Little Thief <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>The newspaper publishes a piece of news:</p>
<p>...Wang Genlin, fourteen years old. While stealing coal dust loaded on a truck, he was accidentally crushed to death by the wheels.</p>
<p>Around the thatched cottage by the small bridge, everyone knows about this little guy, Genlin. And everyone will tell you a story; a sad one.</p>
<p>His father was sent to prison when he was eight years old. For failing to repay the landlord's debt.</p>
<p>His mother died two years ago, exactly.</p>
<p>This child is all alone, with only an old grandmother who is deaf and blind, and relies on her grandson every day to live.</p>
<p>This lively Genlin has a heart that is filial to his grandmother.</p>
<p>A short, short six years, basically unnoticed.</p>
<p>Relying on his own hands, he goes to the factory every day to earn some money. Living like this, he would never curse his fate. Genlin thought in his heart:</p>
<p>How smoothly I am doing. I have not the slightest dissatisfaction with my ancestral fields.</p>
<p>He often stares at the sky in a daze. Sometimes, he would even shed tears when he thought of his parents. However, in an instant, his sorrow would be blown away by the wind in space.</p>
<p>Little Genlin has a quick mind.</p>
<p>People in the factory are very fond of him. Some workers would share half of their flatbread with him.</p>
<p>Naturally, he would often think of the people who shared the flatbread with him. When he finished his own work, he also liked to help others finish their work. Some people said:</p>
<p>"He is so affectionate, this little guy."</p>
<p>Alas! The factory siren has not sounded for more than two months. The two large iron gates are tightly closed. A white sign with black characters is also hung on the gate.</p>
<p>Genlin heard from others that the factory was closed. He was anxious. Anxious...</p>
<p>There is no way. My grandmother needs to be fed. I have to live too!</p>
<p>So, he stole three cakes from the flatbread shop. This is the first time!</p>
<p>I don't like this next time. Alas! How fast my heart is beating!</p>
<p>Tomorrow, my stomach will be hungry again! Blame this useless stomach!</p>
<p>"Genlin, you have to find some other work!..."</p>
<p>Grandma has really been hungry for a long time.</p>
<p>"Grandma, I'll go find something to eat!..."</p>
<p>Walking slowly on the street. A pair of dull eyes constantly dart around at every shop on the street.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he saw a crowd of people over there. Curious, he also rushed over to see!</p>
<p>Stealing!</p>
<p>"He stole our things! Not just this time!"</p>
<p>The shop assistant of the flour shop, holding a wooden stick, said to the people surrounding him. That Shandong accent is so terrible!</p>
<p>"Beat him! Warn him!"</p>
<p>"Thief who steals things! Beat him to death."</p>
<p>"Beat him! Beat him hard!"</p>
<p>The people watching the excitement were all shouting.</p>
<p>Genlin squeezed into the crowd. Secretly poked his head out to take a look at what the thief was like.</p>
<p>Oh! That person who once shared flatbread with him.</p>
<p>He saw that person holding his head in a panic, walking away from the crowd. Oh, he also has a wife and children!</p>
<p>I pray for him, that the beating doesn't hurt!</p>
<p>Genlin only had this wish. He felt even colder about the reward for stealing things!</p>
<p>A fragile heart!</p>
<p>Genlin was listlessly wandering on the road.</p>
<p>Occasionally, he discovered a truck loaded with a lot of coal dust. What a good opportunity!</p>
<p>Climbing up from the wheels. Desperately stuffing the coal dust into the bag.</p>
<p>Unintentionally, the car started moving.</p>
<p>Panicked, he jumped down. Poor little life! Crushed by the wheels! Miserable! Intestines!...Blood...</p>
<p>Little thief! Little thief who doesn't take the right path!</p>
<p>The people on the road were shouting again!</p>
<p>The old grandmother at home is still waiting for a time to be full.</p>

<p>— Tan Shui</p>
<p>The term "love" can only be enjoyed by noble people, another class is called "having an affair".</p>
<p>It is indeed wrong to translate women as "dogs," because if they are also humans, if she is a dog, then the man should be a male dog. Therefore, it is better to translate it as "hook," because if they were not "hooks," how could they turn with amorous glances and cause trouble for thousands?</p>
<p>The Chinese teacher said: "Chinese is the language of our own country, so no matter what, we would rather give up other subjects and have to pay attention to Chinese." The English teacher said: "English is one of the most common languages in the world today, and it will be greatly related to 'occupation' and 'position' in the future, so students have to pay attention to English." The physical education teacher said: "Physical education is the foundation of everything. If you don't have a healthy body, what's the use of having great knowledge?" The teachers are fighting against each other like this, all they want is to do a better job of teaching their own subjects so that they can win a word of praise from the principal. However, it is the students who suffer, how can they follow? In the end, it's still just "everything is not good."</p>
<p>After playing in the New World for two months, I actually wrote an "impression record." Sometimes, I even mistakenly called the store name as the street name. However, after the book came out, it was actually labeled with the title of XX. Isn't it a joke?</p>

<p>— Zhong Shuo</p>
<p>Wang Xiaomazi led Xingfa forward in large strides, frighteningly, holding a ghost-head knife in his right hand and tightly grasping the hemp rope that bound Xingfa's hands behind his back with his left hand, his face full of murderous intent, like escorting a prisoner to the execution ground. However, it was not yet dark, and his gait inevitably carried a sense of panic.</p>
<p>"X your grandmother, won't you walk faster? I'll reward you with a knife!" Xiaomazi's right hand raised, the ghost-head knife gleamed, followed by two "ham kicks" to Xingfa.</p>
<p>Hanging two lines of tears, Xingfa glanced back, catching sight of Xiaomazi's hideous face, and the slow pace followed by an accelerated rate.</p>
<p>"Damn it, what kind of reason does the Red Spear Society have?" Xingfa cursed in his heart: "I borrowed twenty yuan from him before the second half of February, and now he wants sixty-five yuan from me, including principal and interest, less than three months, and the interest is forty-five yuan? Even 'usury' is not this much! Looking at it this way, what Lao Si said about Xiaomazi wanting my wife is true!"</p>
<p>Although the fire of anger was burning, he dared to be angry but dared not speak out, and only a few wrinkles appeared on his dark face. This frustration caused the pace to slow down again, so he received a few knocks on the back with the back of the knife, and the slow pace consciously accelerated again.</p>
<p>In the midst of such high kicks, the colorful clouds in the northwest corner gradually disappeared. Suddenly, Wang Xiaomazi stood still, looking back, seeing nothing, only the sound of dogs barking trembling, carried by the wind. Xiaomazi did not panic, and still forced Xingfa forward.</p>
<p>After another moment, hurried footsteps gradually approached, and when he turned around, three different voices intertwined and said in unison:</p>
<p>"Is that Brother Wang!"</p>
<p>"Exactly, is no one chasing us!"</p>
<p>"Who dares? Haha..." Again, intertwined voices.</p>
<p>"So, Tang Huzi is here too!" Xiaomazi said.</p>
<p>"I saw Lao Si and Chengde Ge running to the main gate, so I came to help." Tang Huzi continued to answer.</p>
<p>"Don't chat!" Chengde and Lao Si raised their red-tasseled spears and took the lead in striding forward.</p>
<p>It wasn't long after dark, and they all entered the village. After entering the house, Xingfa was tied into a ball, and Lao Si held a whip and questioned him while whipping him.</p>
<p>"This year, the rice in the fields is all dried up, you..."</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Realizing that this address was disrespectful "...the several masters certainly know that I will try my best to raise the twenty yuan I owe, even if I don't eat, as for the interest,..."</p>
<p>Xiaomazi was lying on the rattan chair waving a palm-leaf fan, and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Lao Si! Don't nag him, just ask him if he can pay the sixty-five yuan!"</p>
<p>Amidst the groans, Lao Si's whip was raised high again.</p>
<p>"I don't think you can squeeze much oil and water out of him!" The oblivious Tang Huzi said coldly.</p>
<p>Xiaomazi's face immediately sank, and Chengde led Tang Huzi to a secluded place, explaining that Xiaomazi had taken a fancy to Xingfa's wife. Only then did Tang Huzi realize.</p>
<p>"Big brother is asking if you can pay the interest? Otherwise, you can mortgage your wife! Keep crying, it's not like your grandfather died!" Lao Si's whip was about to fall with the voice.</p>
<p>Xingfa thought of his wife, his nose soured, and two lines of tears rolled down like beans.</p>
<p>In the yard, the sound of the brothers' guns and knives whistling was particularly crisp, the jumping of the black shadows under the moonlight was like the dance of barbarians, and the panting of the people outside the house mixed with the groaning inside the house rippled in the air, appearing particularly solemn.</p>
<h3 id="e246">A Gui <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Bo</p>
<p>I. A Gui's Occupation</p>
<p>Thunderous car sounds break the silence of the city. How early! The sky is still the color of fish belly, A Gui pushes a rectangular manure cart to every street, every lane, every store, every residence, pouring the things excreted by others into his own cart barrel by barrel. Knocking on this house's door and then knocking on that house's...</p>
<p>Rumble, rumble...</p>
<p>The sound of iron wheels kissing the stone road.</p>
<p>Dong, dong, dong...</p>
<p>The sound of fists hitting the door.</p>
<p>This life has a history of many years with him, ask a few old ayis, everyone knows that flat face, with a beard all over his chin.</p>
<p>People don't treat him as a human being, and even he himself has forgotten that he is a human being. His sense of smell is like a dog's - of course not a Pekingese dog squatting next to a young lady or madam - it is the kind of dog that opens its mouth and eats the pile of yellowish-orange when it sees it. He can't smell that the excrement is smelly, he relies entirely on this thing to exchange for food.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that what you eat comes out as manure. People are always suspicious of dogs who exchange manure for food! Who knows? In the heavenly city, there are many dog-like people living in hell.</p>
<p>A Gui, with a flat face and a beard all over his chin, is one of the many dog-people.</p>
<p>II. A Gui's Illness</p>
<p>The accumulated filth of day after day, month after month, year after year, seems about to erupt, A Gui's stomach is always gurgling. His buttocks are particularly intimate with the toilet.</p>
<p>It must be because he lay on the street last night and caught a cold, and he has been having diarrhea more than a dozen times this morning. His intestines are knotted, and he always has so little diarrhea. His anus is burning hot, and it hurts when he wipes it with rough paper, and his limbs are weak.</p>
<p>Dysentery! He understands his symptoms. But he has no money, he is not qualified to see a doctor - even the doctor's toilet is emptied by him.</p>
<p>The next day, A Gui still pushes the manure cart out very early, supporting his illness. He has been to the back door of the doctor's house, but he knows that the doctor's clean fingers will not deign to press on his dirty wrist.</p>
<p>He pushes the heavy car body again without hesitation. Heavy steps, to knock on another house's door.</p>
<p>Back in the grass shed, he can't hold on anymore. He falls to the ground on his bunk. But his stomach is acting up again, and he gets up again to squat on the toilet.</p>
<p>Holding up his waistband, he falls back on the bunk, his head heavy as if he has a toilet bowl on it. His hands are pressed tightly on his stomach, and his feet are moving like bellows, moving, moving.</p>
<p>The sun peeks in from the window like it is visiting a patient, kissing his filthy face and filthy clothes.</p>
<p>Unable to bear the pain, unable to bear the heat, he uneasily rolls over to this side, and rolls over to that side.</p>
<p>Like a wounded dog, restless and uneasy, he rolls on the ground.</p>
<p>Bowing and squatting on the toilet, holding up his waistband, he comes back, once, twice, three times...</p>
<p>A person who makes a living by eating manure, who knows? He fell ill on it.</p>

<p>— Wei Nan</p>
<p>God has arranged people's brains to prepare you to think of ways, even the stupidest person will think in their brain, so when God created people, he handed over to people the skill of "thinking".</p>
<p>This thing called "thinking", in people's brains, has indeed given us many improvements in any kind of thing or matter. Therefore, people have today's progress because they have this "thinking". Because they constantly "think", "thinking" has become a combat skill today. However, everyone can "think", but there is a distinction between the wise and the inferior in "thinking". The important key lies here.</p>
<p>Now it is almost an era dedicated to using "thinking". Whoever can "think" and "think" surprisingly will win the victory. However, now is an era of economic terror, all industries are declining, and everything is not going well. In the city, financial tightness only leads to abnormal development, such as the increase in the number of unemployed people, the lack of growth in legitimate businesses, luxury goods fill the stores, and the propertied class only seeks their own enjoyment and momentary intoxication. Therefore, some so-called things that cater to the trend of the times emerge in response, such as cinemas, dance halls, coffee shops, and trends surge and fill the buildings next to the road. In such an acute era, a large labor force is formed, driven to the streets and alleys, spending a miserable life of wandering and unemployment. Therefore, a group of people who can "think", "think" faster than others, and "think" to suit other people's tastes, sell their skills everywhere, such as flattering, supporting the stage, being a running dog, ... In short, in front of the person they admire, they act like a woman, flaunting their charm!</p>
<p>If it doesn't go as planned, in other words, if you don't squeeze in, you will "think" in hundreds of ways, and even sharpen your head as much as possible to drill and operate. And the art of drilling and operating has two aspects, smooth and unsmooth. The so-called smooth aspect is that the three methods of wind, horse and bull are all in place, so when you start drilling, you must be like a loach in the mud, and you can't see the hole, so as to prevent later people from drilling in the same way. The so-called unsmooth aspect is that the person being flattered feels that you are too heavy, and the person being blown feels that you are too loud. Losing these two skills, of course, we cannot talk about "wind". If you want to drill and operate successfully, you have to implement the principle of wind, horse and bull.</p>

<p>Thick coal smoke poured into the room from the open window, abnormally foul. Mrs. Zheng's red eyes were immediately blinded by the flying coal smoke, and she hurriedly raised her hand to rub them. Mrs. Sun saw this clearly and shouted loudly as if she had won:</p>
<p>"Good, good, who told you to be sharp-tongued and criticize people, God is punishing you! Serves you right! Serves you right!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Liu moved her small feet and hurried to the window to close it. A few streaks of black smoke dust hung on Mrs. Xing's fair skin. She didn't notice, but she said as if she was inspired by the scene;</p>
<p>"It's really annoying, we have to eat coal smoke every day!"</p>
<p>Not far outside their window, there was a small factory with a chimney as thick as a bowl spewing out foul-smelling, black smoke dust all day and night. When the wind was favorable, it would blow into the house in gusts.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng had already rubbed her eyes, still not forgetting to smile slowly and continue:</p>
<p>"In a few days, you won't be able to eat it even if you want to."</p>
<p>Her words were protested by Mrs. Xing;</p>
<p>"Then haven't your eyes been blinded enough!"</p>
<p>No one noticed that the coal smoke dissipated in the room after turning a few times.</p>
<p>Outside, everything was hidden in darkness. The windows of the thirteen-story foreign apartment building nearby revealed lights of different colors, and shadows swayed in the windows, occasionally drifting with the songs of men and women singing together. A radio was also broadcasting Shanghai ditties in other houses in the alley.</p>
<p>What about their house? Everything was incomparable, it was desolate, it was miserable, and at the same time there was stuffiness and anger.</p>
<p>Because of this, it was easy to arouse their hatred; why do others have the good fortune to enjoy themselves, and they are just living a hard and difficult life, and now, it seems that they have reached the end of their lives. If they didn't resist Japan, wouldn't they still be able to live in Jilin? So, did they do something wrong?</p>
<p>They talked some nonsense again, but it was all of the unpleasant kind, and some people had tears flowing quietly in their eyes.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Sun, would you sing another section?"</p>
<p>Whenever they feel restless and helpless, they need Mrs. Sun to defuse the situation; because she can sing a few ditties. Mrs. Liu saw the sad tears in other people's eyes, and proposed this because she wanted to relieve the pain in people's hearts in a short time.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Further Discussion on Dialect and Vernacular Films (Part 2) <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Danfeng</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Tang Na</p>
<p>Everyone acknowledges that the vernacular movement of the May Fourth era accomplished unification. However, since a portion of them rebelled, and another portion surrendered to feudal forces, while the vanguard still hasn't abandoned its mission. Regarding this point, because the vernacular unification movement is quite beneficial to us, a portion rebelled for their own interests, even returning to classical Chinese in an attempt to regress to the past. On the other hand, we need to accelerate social reform through culture, so language unification is definitely not a task to be ignored. As for films and dramas that educate the masses, to increase their artistic effectiveness, we may adopt a portion of the vernacular, or a certain play may be temporarily performed in a local dialect. This is merely one of our means, and it definitely does not contradict the principle of a common language. Furthermore, we will produce copies of films needed by the masses in a certain local dialect. However, this should definitely not be interpreted the same way as the "business sense" of film merchants. Therefore, Mr. Tang Na's vigorous advocacy of Cantonese sound films, in fact, encourages this business-minded trend. Moreover, even if films are made in Cantonese, they might not be understood by the people of Shantou. It goes without saying that they would lose the national scope they should have. Furthermore, according to his argument, if dialects are allowed to develop fully, will the countryside revert to primitive times? This is what we want to ask. Originally, dialects are very primitive things. Regarding his statement of "division for unification," we have already explained it earlier. Now, we want to strengthen the leading role, to make it tend towards unification, rather than division.</p>
<p>He said: "At present, the language and even the social economy of the Han people are inherently divided… The unity of the nation did not begin to be divided by the promotion of dialect films, dramas, and literature." He also said: "The process of language unification is definitely not as simple as Mr. Danfeng described." As for who is dividing the Chinese nation, we have already explained that earlier. As for the latter's theory that the cultural movement is useless, that is simply unacceptable. Indeed, we acknowledge that language unification must rely on economic and political actions as the main driving force, while the cultural movement is also always one of the main driving forces. I ask, are we currently engaged in a cultural movement? Even after the entire economic foundation is reformed, will a sound cultural movement still be needed? In the current stage of China, the objective environment does not allow us to eliminate illiteracy, this is a fact, but we must move towards that path. Film is a powerful tool for educational work, why shouldn't it shoulder the task of unifying language? And the common language we are now building is intended to unify the language of the masses of the entire Han ethnicity. The theory that culture is useless is certainly absolutely wrong, and saying that culture cannot promote language unification is also a cowardly misinterpretation. From the May Fourth movement to the present, we have never abandoned the work of unification. And now, whoever can promote the unification of language and culture will achieve leadership victory.</p>
<p>According to his argument, if things continue to develop, because he wants to enable the masses to read, write, and speak quickly, he will propose removing Chinese characters, using Latin letters for phonetic transcription, or Practical Esperanto. As for whether the future development of language and culture will have this prospect, we dare not predict yet. However, in the current stage, if we abolish Chinese characters, which have become compatible with the living habits of the masses and become a weapon of struggle, that would be an unreasonable and arbitrary move that deviates from objective reality, if we believe that we are not impractical dreamers who are detached from reality.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, we can learn from the experiment of the Japanese Ministry of Education's vigorous efforts to abolish Chinese characters and replace them with "Katakana." The result is that second-year middle school students cannot understand a very short letter written in "Katakana," and similarly, if Chinese people write letters using phonetic symbols, it would not necessarily be easy to understand. However, phonetic symbols still have their use in the common language unification movement, provided that they do not inherently harm the growth of the common language. As for abolishing Chinese characters and abolishing China's inherent culture, this is in any case a high-sounding tone that is detached from the masses and non-struggling. Perhaps we can develop theoretical discussions in this direction in the future, but what we need now is to build a common and applicable language for the general public with substantial content based on Chinese characters.</p>
<p>Chinese films, up to now, although they cannot penetrate factories or the countryside, and neither in content nor in form can they become what the masses urgently need. But we are undoubtedly moving towards that path. At the same time, Mr. Tang Na also acknowledges that there is already a kind of Mandarin circulating among the masses, and this is the best blueprint for the subtitles of common language sound and silent films.</p>
<p>Not at all wrong, no one can independently create a standard common language, but it must be "done by the masses themselves." However, truly conscientious intellectuals who serve the masses, go deep into the masses to discover and select, and express it in films or other works of art, is definitely not a crime, right? Mr. Tang Na should not maliciously misinterpret this point. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e250">Review of "It Happened One Night" <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>ItHappenedOneNight</p>
<p>——Grand Theater——</p>
<p>Similar to "Lady for a Day," Frank Capra adopted a story that has very little truth, but he used superior expressive skills, making people believe that everything he said was true, like reality in a dream. Although waking up feels infinitely empty, at the time of dreaming, one feels a certain degree of comfort or sorrow.</p>
<p>Indeed, the story of this film is very fanciful. If we acknowledge that the development of characters cannot be separated from economic or environmental determinism, then from the great banker, the rich daughter, to the unemployed reporter, the characters are all unrealistic and become unique in the world. At least they are all good guys in the eyes of the story author. In terms of moral concepts, he created several good people longed for by those with old ideas. The banker unconditionally dotes on his daughter, the rich daughter surprisingly falls in love with an unemployed newspaper reporter, and the unemployed newspaper reporter is even a gentlemanly sensualist. In order to pursue a woman, he twice abandoned a reward of ten thousand gold. Perhaps a sophist would explain it this way, because the newspaper reporter knew whose daughter the young lady was. Obtaining her love and further marrying her is more reliable and stable than temporarily obtaining twenty thousand gold. But on the screen, it tells us that when the young lady expressed her love to him in the small hotel, he rejected her. This gentlemanly exaggeration does not intend to play on the money or the love. On the surface, this and the young lady running to the newspaper reporter seems to be a contradiction. And this contradiction is often found in unrealistic works of art.</p>
<p>If it is said that after the young lady's suitcase was stolen on the long-distance bus, although she was poor, she could still run to her new husband within the possible range (she still has more than four yuan). Then, the later scenes would have no way to unfold. Of course, we don't have to ask this way, but this story is structured in many accidental coincidences and lacks inevitability, which is a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>However, the screenwriter Robert Riskin, like the director, cleverly concealed these coincidences. He paid attention to the strict structure of each section, especially in the description of the characters' personalities. He made the imaginary characters come alive from small places. Originally, they were not real, but he emphasized the exaggeration to make them almost real. From this point of view, the screenwriter was victorious.</p>
<p>We will not neglect Frank Capra, the author of "Lady for a Day." In "Lady for a Day," he has already given us a deep understanding. The poor old woman is pitiful all her life, but because she is deeply moving, she receives the sincere help of the governor and even the hooligans. As a result, she became a lady for a day and fulfilled her daughter's marriage to the count, and thus she herself became luxurious. This upward-climbing preaching has already given us a clear indication of his poisoning of the audience. And in this "It Happened One Night"? His theme is: As long as the unemployed newspaper reporter has firm ambition and personality, and can sincerely love a rich daughter, the result is that he can become a dragon-riding son-in-law of a big banker and become unexpectedly wealthy. This vulgar philosophy is completely consistent with that expressed in "Lady for a Day."</p>
<p>A clumsy preaching will not cause any bad shaking to the arrogant audience, but he uses so-called excellent expressive skills, exaggeratingly making film art a tool of deception, making people moved by his yellow preaching, which is a terrible poisoning for the relatively backward audience.</p>
<p>Standing on the standpoint of appreciating old film art, we acknowledge that this Frank Capra, who truly comes from the film industry, does have his own unique features. As far as this film is concerned, he displays his talents in all aspects. Lively and compact montage, harmonious tones, rich interest, flexible angles, and the grasp of the characters' personalities are all purely cinematic and very successfully achieve his success. If only from these places, we have no way to find his shortcomings. We must integrate content and form and criticize him as a whole. Then, we require film art to be 100% expressive of truth, and definitely not use it as a deceptive preaching. Otherwise, it only shows that American film art has developed to its highest point and is heading towards decline. Using highly expressive skills to serve yellow propaganda will make this propaganda deeper and more terrifying. Film art has become a cursed thing in Capra's hands. This is what we should seriously point out.</p>

<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Jidi giggled and said, "Oh, that's the little friend!" That handsome young man said apologetically, "I heard you praise me like that, and I felt a little dizzy in my head, and I didn't expect to overturn the car." Yi Di asked, "What's your name?" That young man looked at her and smiled, "Tom." Yi Di looked at him and saw that he was indeed a very handsome young man, so she couldn't help but smile and say, "Okay, Tom, we've let you hear everything we said." Tom then took the opportunity to threaten, "I'll treat you to lunch, okay? Otherwise, I'll tell Pan Shen about what you said." Jidi also pleaded from the side, "Yi Di, promise him!" Tom looked at Jidi and said, "In Li Dao, there's also a very good-looking swimming teacher." Yi Di finally agreed, partly because Jidi was begging so hard that she couldn't refuse, and partly because Tom kept smiling at her like that, making her unable to resist.</p>
<p>They had lunch in Li Dao and then ran to the beach to swim. There was indeed a swimming teacher there, as good-looking as Tom had said. Jidi got to know the swimming teacher and the two of them hid behind a sand dune to talk about love, leaving Tom to accompany Yi Di to rest under a large parasol. Tom kept looking at Yi Di, as if reluctant to let go. After Yi Di swam for a while, she lay on the sand panting娇喘嘘, and Tom couldn't help but feel moved. He asked, "Comfortable?" Yi Di looked at him and also felt her heart pounding, but she reminded herself that she was a good woman and that she had a specific purpose in coming to Palm Beach. She kept the name Pan Qi firmly in her mind. So she reluctantly replied, "Of course, very comfortable." Tom said, "We can come here to play every day." Yi Di suddenly sat up and said, "Tom, listen, we have a lot of things in common. We can be considered people of the same path. I don't need to pretend with you anymore…" Tom heard that and felt it was completely his father's tone, so he couldn't help but exclaim, "Oh? What's wrong?" Yi Di said, "To put it simply, my purpose in coming here is to marry a millionaire." Tom said, "Are you talking about Mr. Pan?" Yi Di said, "That's not necessarily the case. Maybe his friends are also okay." Tom also sat up and said slowly, "Money is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that you can be with someone who can make you crazy." He leaned closer to her, and in a moment, their faces were close together. Yi Di felt very anxious and wanted to stand up, but Tom tripped her with his foot and knocked her down. Tom took the opportunity of her falling down, put his arm around her, and kissed her in his arms. In that instant, Yi Di forgot her restraint and couldn't help but let him kiss her. But she suddenly pushed him away again, used all her strength to climb up, and said sternly to Tom, "Quick, give me the key to the bathroom!" Tom pleaded, "Yi Di, I won't disappoint you." Yi Di looked at him again and娇嗔 said, "Why can't we be true friends? I'm all sincerity." He laughed. She was so cute when she was angry. Alas, what would she be like when she was happy? So he said, "Okay, let's be true friends. I'll give you a true proof first… Look!" He pointed to a beautiful yacht on the sea in front and said, "That's Pan Qi's yacht." Yi Di looked over, overjoyed, and said, "Oh, it really is!" Tom said, "Look, the owner's flag is flying high, that means Pan Qi is on the boat now. Let me call a small boat to send you to the yacht, okay?" Yi Di heard that, opened her big eyes,转咕噜三噜, and said: "You are really a good person, but let me call the boat myself." She was calculating in her heart that she wanted to get rid of the young man. (To be continued)</p>
