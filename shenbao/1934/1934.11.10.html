<p>時評</p>
<h3>法內閣更易內幕及其前瞻</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>法國杜邁格內閣受任迄今。閲時九月。內政外交斐然可觀。今方進行其改革憲法之計劃。藉以完成其鞏固行政權力之志願。不謂壯志未遂。竟以急進社會黨之反對。不能不出於辭職之一途。爲山九仞。功虧一簣。惜哉。</p>
<p>杜氏所以辭職之原因。自表面觀察。在於杜氏要求國會表决明年一二三三個月之政費。然稍加推敲。即知核心並不在此。即憲法修改問題。恐亦非杜閣辭職之真因。就我人所見。此次政潮。仍爲史達維斯基舞弊案之餘波。按杜氏就任之始。曾宣言澈查此案真相。及二月六日軍警與民衆衝突之責任問題。然此二大事件。與急進社會黨頗多直接間接之牽渉。此黨既在國會中佔甚大之多數。則國會所組之檢查委員會。自必受其多方操縱。故九月以來。後一案件。即以「雙方誤會」一語了結。實則軍警之出動。與實彈之戒備。皆出達拉地之命令。唯以達氏爲急進社會黨之故。不能不如此含糊了結也。就名義而論。所謂急進社會黨。必爲甚急進之左翼政黨。何至效資産政黨之所爲。而唯利祿是尚。實則法國之急進社會黨。既不急進。更與社會黨無甚關係。究其實質。乃一中産階級之政黨。名實本不相符。唯其如是。故與史氏舞弊案頗有多少之關涉。如赫禮歐內閣時身任工務部長與旭丹內閣時任殖民部長之達賴米。曾勸商人投資史達維斯基所經營之事業。旭丹內閣時曾任法長之藍諾地。且曾與史氏黨徒合資經營事業。旭丹之至親柏拉薩。身任最高檢察官。以史氏舞弊事發。且爲設法彌縫至十九次之多。就法國右方報紙所載。急進黨之共和工商委員會主席泊魯司。且曾受史氏二百萬佛郎之賄賂。此外法官律師之被殺自殺者。不一而足。據某一警察告發。凡受有史氏賄賂之證據綫索。約有一千餘件。但一經交給國會檢查委員會之後。此等物證。皆無形消滅。故九月以來。史案真相始終未明。此案牽涉範圍之大。可想而知。按史氏一身。所負之空頭債劵。數在五萬六千萬佛郎以上。而此等債劵之發行。又得達官要員之援助。一旦真相暴露。不第舞弊案中之主角。有罹法網之虞。即於急進社會黨之聲譽。亦有莫大影響。急社黨爲自全計。勢不得不保持在現國會中之多數勢力。以便以充裕之時間。消滅有關史案之物證。故於最近將來。自必力阻內閣權力之擴張。反對國會之解散。蓋恐解散之後。史案物證猶在。難保不水落石出也。故今次杜邁格與急進黨之鬥爭。焦點全在於此。杜氏所欲者。乃在解散現有之國會。而急社黨所求者。乃在保存現在之國會。雙方之爭點既在於此。則欲求其繼續合作。自屬難能。及杜氏要求明春政費之意思表露後。急社黨始知杜氏有隨時解散現國會之决心。遂以先發制人之手段。推倒杜氏。此杜閣不能不辭之所由來也。</p>
<p>今佛蘭亭新閣已組成。一時似可無事。唯佛氏屬共和左翼。於下院中僅佔二九席。上院中僅一三席。勢力甚微。此後一舉一動。自非聽命於急社黨不可。否則彼之內閣殊難穩固。惟史氏舞弊案真相不明。人民對於現政黨領袖不能無疑。而本屆國會短間期內又無改選之望。民衆能否不至因懷疑而失望。因失望而發生波折。牽動政局。殊未可知耳。</p>

<h3>海會成敗關鍵視日態度爲轉移</h3>
<p>日政府正考慮英提案</p>
<p>台維斯幕後沉着工作</p>
<p>［倫敦］今午日代表曾欵宴美代表、除此而外、海軍談話絶無動静、蓋待日政府關於英國折衷提案之覆文也、衆意日政府接受該提案之希望甚微、惟冀該提案或可成一索價還價之點、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>［東京］日外務省昨夜接駐英大使松平之官報、報告英國已向美日代表團提出折衷方案、在某種條件下承認日本之海軍平等要求、外相廣田今晨在閣議報告倫敦海軍談話經過情形、同時駐日英大使克萊武爵士至外務省會晤外次重光葵、對此次駐蓀英艦隊總司令德萊雅爵士蒞日、承朝野竭誠欵待、表示謝忱、並與重光葵交換海軍談話之情報、及討論其他問題、外務省人員現正研究英國之提案、繼將與海軍省開聯席會議討論之、外務省發言人今日聲稱、日本深感英國之努力以謀妥恊、但英國提案與日本原提之案、相去尚遠云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］今日此間官塲於接到英國努力斡旋卒歸失敗之消息後、仍表示倫敦雙方的海軍談話或可保全之希望、國務副總理費理浦今日聲稱、美代表台維斯刻在幕後作沉着不懈之工作云、此説已引起一般人之推測、以爲美代表團定有一種尚未宣佈之計劃、可免談話完全失敗、同時據路透社倫敦電訊、英國計劃欲避免因海軍平等爭執而起之複雜問題、刻正在日代表考慮之下、聞英方方案之要點、在給予日本以更多之潛艇、給予美國以更多之飛機母艦、給予英國以更多之廵艦、但此新方案所規定之數字、日方認爲不滿、聞英國新方案、志在抛棄平等與比率問題、蓋內容不同之海軍、絶不能有平等也、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>英折衷新方案對日多方遷就</h3>
<p>純以國防需要爲標準</p>
<p>承認日增加海軍比率</p>
<p>［倫敦］七日之日英會談英國方面所提示之妥恊案、據可靠方面消息、該提案中關於海軍比率、英國對於日本爲極重要讓歩之條項、包含在內、並承認日本增加海軍力之比率、對日	以所要求之總噸數主義雖暗中拒絶、然將加入艦種别及特殊噸數制使各關係海軍國宣佈最大限度建艦案以代之、又關於攻擊的武器防禦的武器之意義、容納日本主張之一部、承認潛水艦其他日本所謂防禦的武器之擴大云、惟日美兩國對此妥恊案、均持冷淡之態度、結果將仍束之高閣而已、英國代表部方面極力辨護七日之會談、並未向日本提出特别之提案云、（八日電通電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］工黨機關報每日民聲報曾載稱、英國政府對於海會初歩談話、已提出兩項建議云云、（已見前電）此項建議、用意在打開海軍談話之僵局、但不能正式認爲英國之調解建議案、消息靈通人士謂、兩項建議之要點、在設法使未來海軍條約、不在各國海軍之間設立任何等級、俾各國海軍政策得純以本國國防需要爲標準、參加海約之各國以『紳士恊定』相約、將彼此造艦程序及遇有修改之處、互相通知、華盛頓條約所規定之按照艦種即質的限制一層、或可維持、但每一艦種內各種不同之艦型、將從新分配、至於政治條欵將分别談判、日本代表團內部對於新提建議之意見、隨政治觀點或技術觀點而不同、美國代表所保留態度、一般人以爲美國方面之所以愼重者、蓋恐東京拒絶、意欲候日本答復之後、再行表示意見耳、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［東京］曾於七日之日英會商由英國首相麥唐納試提之方案、其骨子大致如左、（一）尊重國家體面、提出軍備平等及建艦計畫應於事前豫先與關係國恊議、將保有量限制一方面者及自發者、換言之、乃尊重國家體面、而日本主張之實質上平等、不欲即時承認、然爲滿足軍備平等之抽象原則起見、各國雖能限制其必要之兵力、但各國完全達到其最大限度之建艦亦可不必、應由關係國對於實質上之保有量加以恊議、行使公正嚴明之恊定可也、上項結果、各國雖無法律上之義務、但宜使之負擔道德上之義務也云云、（九日日聯電）</p>
<h3>認爲迎合美國日本未饜所欲</h3>
<p>拒絶唯恐負破裂責任</p>
<p>廢約手續積極準備中</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國麥唐納首相所提出之妥恊和案中有「質的量的調整」一項、其中有一部縱令承認潛水艦之增量、然减少其他之艦種、全體仍與現存化率無大差殊、蓋欲藉此以迎合美國、日本代表部關於此點、擬於下次日英會商斷然指摘此案之缺陷、求其再考、（九日電通電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］日代表團研究英國提案、其內容不過保持平等名義、實質上對於現行比率加以多大變更、與日本根本方針仍不爲合致、日代表團因恐拒絶此提案之結果、致無機會繼續交涉、决定方針使英更加諒解日本主張、以便實現日主張、（九日日聯電）</p>
<p>［東京］日政府務欲從速完成廢棄華府條約手續、闡明帝國决意、故八日下午有要訓電、致倫敦松平山本兩代表、緣廣田外相容納大角海相之主張、謂關於統帥事項之手續業已完成之今日、不可延不發表廢棄通告云云、因此廣田外相與岡田首相大角林各相恊議結果、遂訓令對英美再勸告共同廢棄、並勸告意法亦共同廢棄、現政府待松平山本兩代表勸告交渉完竣之公電到達後將開閣議採取諮詢樞府之手續、其時期夶角海相主張在臨時議會之前、岡田林、廣田各相亦贊成此説、故二十日左右之閣議、將决定諮詢樞府案、至二十五日左右當可完成國內關於廢棄條約之一切手續（九日電通電）</p>
<p>［東京］朝日新聞評論英國之折衷辦法、謂日本之要求平等天然而合理、實不容有任何討論、美國竟加以拒絶、誠令人不解、如海軍談話因是而决裂、美國須負厥責云、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>松平投函英報美日開誠相見</h3>
<p>東京所傳斥爲無稽</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國各報最近摘登日本「日日新聞」所載一文、內稱日本山本少將與美國海軍參謀長史丹萊、曾　日美兩國海軍實力爭辨甚烈、因此松平大使特在「晨郵報」發表一公開函、對於各報此種消息反駁甚力、略謂、「海軍談話實在情形、無論在任何方面、均與各報所載大相逕庭、美日兩國代表在實際上、均出以十分懇切和諧之態度、蓋此次談話、各方瀝誠相見、毫無隔閡、其必出以懇摯之態度、自不難理解也、上項消息、並謂日美兩國代表會談時、感情頗爲「激昻」、統係無稽之談、乃竟在報端披露、殊可扼腕、余深冀未來事實有以證明其處僞」、云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>探聽海會消息</h3>
<p>［倫敦］前爲軍縮問題代表希特勒奔走各國之李本德羅浦、聞現在倫敦、此訊現已證實、李氏奉希特勒之命來此、意在探聽海軍初歩談判之消息、此間德國人士亦謂李氏之來、與海會談判非無關係云、李氏擬再盤桓數日、然後轉赴英國北部云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>工黨動議禁私人製造車火</p>
<p>收歸國有爲世界樹一模範</p>
<p>卒以大多數票被否决</p>
<p>自由黨要求司法調查</p>
<p>［倫敦］工黨議員阿特理今日在下院提出禁止私人製造軍火之動議時、謂甚有體面之海軍要人與公民亦從事於殺人放火之貿易云、工黨此項動議引起歷時頗久之辯論、卒以二七九票對六八票遭否决、</p>
<p>工黨動議文曰、「本院贊民國聯盟約所表示私人製造軍火至可反對之意見、本院嘆惜國際迄未有處理此種公認的危害之恊定、本院以爲英國應立即禁止本國人民私人製造及經營軍火、並設法由國家製造可認爲必要之軍備與彈藥、以示模範、」</p>
<p>工黨認軍火公司乃世界各處政府官員因以腐化之勢力、阿特理聲稱、海陸軍要人多爲軍火公司之職員、其故不僅在彼等有經營商業之才、彼等在軍火貿易中既有根深蒂固之利害關係、故雖有較賢明之政治家、亦不能使其造成世界和平之努力得以成功、渠以爲軍火製造、收爲國有、乃正當之途徑、外相西門答稱、英政府歡迎此項辯論、在此事件上、英國較諸世界任何他國更少可責備之理由、政府確信處理此事之確實可行的辦法、不在國家製定法案、但在依照日內瓦所談判之國際條約加以管理、英國對於軍火之輸出、管理甚爲嚴密、苟無執照輒不許出境、而軍火輸出之防運交外國政府者、英國亦不發給執照、英國從未許其駐外之外交員及領署代表爲軍火、公司之説客、或兜攬員、必外國聲明其購買軍火之意思時、外交方面始予以贊助、而竭力使英國商家獲有適當之機會、英國對於軍火輸出之貿易、不予以出口借欵之特惠、世畉各國能如此者唯英國耳、英國從不津貼製造軍火之私人工廠、而英國管理辦法、亦較任何他國爲嚴密、此問題非僅僅禁止私人製造、便可應付、英政府不信補救方法、在國家專賣、渠以爲最善方法爲一種國際恊定、庶製造與輸出軍火之各國、悉有嚴密之限制與管理、英政府現所努力者在此、至此美參院軍火貿易調查會所發表之事件、渠對於友邦之調查、不欲輕率發言、但覺其所用成立結論之方法、非英國所可採用耳、試舉一例言之、美參院所認爲證據之一電、係美國某軍火廠駐波蘭經理人競爭失敗者所發、據謂彼未能獲有波蘭定單、乃英皇喬治從中運動所致、英皇召見波蘭大使、告以波蘭購買英國軍火之重要、此種傳説離奇已極、須知英皇並非如美參院調查錄中所稱之英政府中高位人物、但爲一國元首、絶不能與售買軍火事發生任何關係也云、</p>
<p>樞密大臣包爾温稱、工黨動議之自的、不過欲成立實業國有之原則耳、渠聞人言、售軍火而獲利、爲不道德事、但製造軍火而獲工資、則不爲不道德事也、渠以爲製造軍火之政府專利、則世界軍備勢必大增、一九二五年英國政府曾批准取締國際軍火貿易之公約、徒因他國多未批准、此約致成廢紙、但吾人現將再往日內瓦竭其能力、務使各國皆批准之云、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］自由黨議員於國會以大多數打銷工黨所提出禁止私人製造軍火之動議後、要求對于軍火貿易之全部問題予以司法上之調查、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>防止煽亂案䣐　以院一番舌戰</h3>
<p>反對黨修正案打銷</p>
<p>［倫敦］英上院今晨四時十二分始休會、計集會十二時之久、此爲一八八七年自治案辯論後歷時最久之集會、反對黨對於政府防止煽亂案提出修正案二十四起、政府黨議員六十人與工黨議員十人舌戰而一一打銷之、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］社會黨議員愛倫爵士今日在上院辯論防止煽亂案時、宣佈驚人事件、據謂數月前渠個人得悉有一機關謀奪英國廣播電社、而成立政變、擬採違反憲法之手段奪取政權云、至於此機關是否左傾抑爲右傾、則愛倫爵士不允宣佈之、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>英外部商部考慮應付日新油法</h3>
<p>日本覆文轉送油公司</p>
<p>［倫敦］英外部現會同商部考慮英國此後對付日本新油法所應採之歩驟、英政府已將日本覆文轉送各英商油公司、苟日本油法不改、則英商將損失不貲、日本覆文數日前送交英國、迄未發表、惟知其態度英國認爲不滿耳、英美荷三國刻正由駐日外交官從事商榷、依照日本新油法、日政府有權規定油之售價、外人油公司且須在日本存油、日當道得於緊急時自由收用云、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>李頓忠告英人不能單獨行動</h3>
<p>對僞國問題應守國聯决議</p>
<p>［倫敦］國聯會滿洲調查團主席李頓爵士鑒於英國輿論有所改變、特在泰晤士報發表公開函、極力加以反對、略謂、『一九三三年二月二十四日國聯非常大會通過决案、决定不承認「滿洲國」、英國係投票贊成國之一、焉能不徵求其他國聯會員國之意見、而單獨有所行動』云云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］下院今日質問財部、可否「因日本拒絶履行國際聯盟義務」、向國會保證對於日本或「滿洲國」之債欵概不核准、財長張伯倫答覆、不允給與國會此種具體保證、張氏謂此種具體保證萬難辦到、每一債欵必須個别考慮云、發問者爲工黨議員韋爾穆、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本證劵大跌</h3>
<p>［東京］日本證劵因駐滿機關改革問題之糾紛、預算編製之困難等、種種情形壓廹空氣、且至最近非常得利得税行將實現、日來價格大跌、現在市塲不見買方、祗有買方跳梁不已、</p>
<p>東京證劵交易所理事長及代表四人八日訪問日銀總裁土方·及興業銀行總裁結誠、説明證劵暴跌情形、並懇請借用資本六千萬元、兩總裁答以考慮此事、代表等其次訪問藤井藏相、報告訪問日銀興銀兩總裁之事後、訪問政府計劃之臨時利得税、估計是否過多、其實政府意見是否欲徵一億元左右、藏相言明不然、並説十年度不再增税、且政府增税目的全在培養經濟力、强化財政內容、</p>
<p>日本銀行總裁土方於會見證劵交易所代表後對記者談曰、證劵跌落之原因、並非實業界或金融界景氣之惡化、係因於增税問題之心理作用、因此日本銀行不必立即研究具體對策、日本銀行對於交易所通融資本誘發買方主動、然如發生别種恐怖觀念、則毫無功效、本人暫時静觀情形如何、然後决定對策云云、</p>
<p>藤井藏相謂曰、交易所代表來詢政府方針、財政當局之所希望者爲國民經濟之發展、財政基礎之强化、今次以愼重態度研究實行臨時利得税辦法、除此决意以外、並無其他增加一般税收之意、（九日日聯電）</p>
<h3>德實施新條例美貿易受影響</h3>
<p>汽車銷路爲之閉絶</p>
<p>［華盛頓］最近德國對於國外貿易、實行新規例、使美國貨物、尤其是汽車在德國銷路、實際上爲之閉絶、國務院頃已下令、對於此事、進行嚴格調查、政府因德國雖已將美德商約宣告廢止、但在一九三五年十月以前、商約繼續有效、故德國所採措置、係違反商約所載之最惠國條欵、或將提出抗議、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>米商與零售商受影響</p>
<p>議會取締案暫行擱置</p>
<p>［馬尼剌］斐律濱華僑數千人、因參院多數議决擱置限制外商零售業及米業兩案、遂得苟延殘喘、兩案已於前三日內爲衆院所通過、參院方面亦表示贊同、但因議案山積、議會停會時竟無暇提出討論、華僑商人握有菲島零售業及米業之重要部份、深以該兩案之通過爲懼、議會將於一九三五年及一九三六年開會、華僑决定繼續努力打銷此案云、斐律濱華僑商會現已組成特别委員會、辦理此事、根據零售業議案、從事零售業之外商須儘於一九三六年底淸理其業務、庶使斐律濱人能佔重要經商地位、反對者稱此次定期過於短促、至少應予五年之時期云、衆院委員會並議决於外商勢力剷除後、予斐人及美人以機會均等之權利、該委員會發表統計稱、斐島零售業、華人佔五成、日人佔二成、斐人佔二成强、其他國人不及一成、苟非將外商排斥、斐商實無機會發展也、至於米業規則規定斐人或美人以外之任何國人或任何外人公司、不准直接或間接賣買米稻、惟准外商於五年內淸理其業務、華僑方面則以一八四二年以來中國已絡續開闢商埠、任外人前往經商、今認斐島此事爲不公、正竭力反對云、（九日國民社電）</p>

<h3>嘉禾輪昨到滬</h3>
<p>三船員仍無下落</p>
<p>蘇警長報告經過</p>
<p>招商局被盗騎刦之嘉禾輪船、已於昨日下午一民時五十分進口到滬、當在金利源新江天碼頭停泊、船主沙增嘉·大副崔聽明等、均到局報告、記者昨向該輪船員面詢經過狀况、承告以被盗詳情如下、</p>
<p>盗匪混入</p>
<p>嘉禾輪於四日晨離汕頭前、先有海盗兩名、扮充苦力、上船定艙位、茶房引其觀看、兩匪先欲官艙、經茶房逐一領看後、忽又不要、旋在統艙內看定兩位、其實定位時、即係預先看定出入路徑、與船內航警住所、當付定洋二十元、各盗嗣乘普通搭客下船時、又混進十人、總計十二匪、共購船票十張、有兩匪未曾買票、各匪均短衣如苦力、而所携手槍甚小、得以藏匿、四日六時許開船、當地軍警、照例將搭客檢查、但未將各匪兇器搜出、</p>
<p>檢查船票</p>
<p>嘉禾輪於四日晨七時、由汕頭開往厦門、船內搭客連同盗匪、共祇三十餘名、而且均爲統艙客、約九時許船到汕頭港口、照例檢查客票、由一賬房帶一航警班長、及航警兩人、逐一查看、查至船尾統艙間、查得有兩海盗未曾購票、先稱没有錢、未買票、船上慣例如遇無錢買票者、須在身畔抄檢、不意因抄查盗身、而即開槍發難也、</p>
<p>擊斃航警</p>
<p>當時兩海盗乘航警不備、一匪擎起手槍、對準航警楊澤田、喝令舉手、另有兩匪、突然躍出、將蘇班長與航警吳金印、雙手執住、不使吳警能抽所掛匣子砲、此際爲槍指住之楊航警、出匪不備、向統艙外狂奔、蓋欲抽槍開放也、盗匪豈肯放過、從後急追、楊下扶梯、匪從後連放兩槍、一彈中楊頭部、一中腰間、楊猶扶創逃入五號室內、將門急閉、思與對抗、詎匪已追至、對五號室又開兩槍、楊警即受彈倒斃、</p>
<p>廹令繳械</p>
<p>盗匪開槍後、蘇班長與吳航警兩槍、已被收繳、吳行至中艙間、亦被盗放一槍、傷其後頭部、然後逼向駕駛台而去、時適大副崔聽明值班、突聞三聲槍響、查詢何事、茶房謂、大約航警試槍、言未畢、海盗已到、不問情由、出槍對崔、問爾何人、崔言大副、匪即令崔繳械、崔答、我無槍、盗匪四人、仍以內槍挾崔、逼令同往航警室、收取餘四警匣子砲、此時航警室內劉班長、已得訊、急帶同航警徐福林·張雨田·兩人、各上子彈、謀對海盗作戰、其時前後艙、已爲海盗隔斷、情勢非常危險、</p>
<p>威脅船主</p>
<p>崔大副爲四匪挾往航警室、行至將到後稍扶梯畔、蘇班長槍已上彈、匿在梯畔、擬將該四盗一舉而盡殲之、挨匪行近、立即開槍、爲一茶房所見大驚、急請劉班長勿放槍、如果開槍、大副即首遭殺害、匪盗且揚言如果傷害一人、即放火燒船、同歸於盡、崔大副在此威廹下、亦急止劉等勿對抗、迅將四槍交匪、復由匪逼令至船主室內、强令船主沙增嘉、將船掉首、向南航行、</p>
<p>監視船員</p>
<p>嘉禾輪既改向南行、全部船員、盡爲匪盜監視、無綫電已爲匪損壞、亦不能通報盗匪禁止全船乘客及水手人等、不許出艙室一歩、否則開槍轟擊、並且派匪值班、輪流警戒、海盗領袖、年約五十餘歳、身穿破衣、其發號施令、多用英語、全體海盗中、操粤音者有之、操汕頭音者有之、即據大餐間、爲其集議地、</p>
<p>分頭搜刦</p>
<p>海盗分批搜刦、經過二十二小時之久、先刦旅客、內一學生被刦二百餘元、一和尚被刦三百五十元、一錢莊夥友、被刦四百餘元、一小販被刦小洋一千餘角、賬房間被刦二百餘元、二貝辦被刦九十三元、水手等身畔所帶現洋、亦掃數刦去、現欵刦盡則搜刦衣物、總計全部損失、約共現洋一千八百餘元、衣服等項不計其數、</p>
<p>開艙搜檢</p>
<p>嗣又向業務主任沈欽祥、責令交出現欵、沈告以本船在汕開航、係空輪無貨、並無現欵裝載、盗不信、出示艙單後、又廹交各項鎖匙、將各艙開示、盗始相信、</p>
<p>强廹漁船</p>
<p>次晨六時、船到約距汕尾五海里地方、匪欲離輪他去、顧無漁船、可供盗乘、匪首命船主放一舢舨入海、找尋漁船、船主言、舢舨太小、下海恐有翻沉之虞、即由嘉禾輪代爲尋覓、嗣在汕尾附近、見一漁船、正在滿篷前進、嘉禾輪追上、匪盗喝令下篷、漁船初未注意、後經匪盗開放四槍、該漁舟急落篷停泊、嘉禾靠上、盗匪發贓上船而去、</p>
<p>綁架船員</p>
<p>匪盗臨行時、謂所刦銀錢等無幾、尚須蝕本、故須綁架船員五人同去、除業務主任沈欽祥·賬房李孝彬·理貨葛良辰三人、决定架去外、又將二買辦邱全能·三買辦某君·亦一併綁去、該二人已爲匪拖到船邊、經一舵工向匪首言、此二人係管理收貨發籌小事、匪首言既不是二買辦、將二人放了吧、邱等未被架去、正徼倖耳、又聞匪盗防嘉禾輪將若輩所乘之漁船撞沉、故架沈等三人、作爲護身等、而兼以勒索巨欵耳、</p>
<p>運到警柩</p>
<p>被盗擊斃航警楊澤田·盗等初擬抛尸入海、嗣由船主等哀求始免、受傷吳金印、傷在頭部、嘉禾輪於六日晨六時、、開往厦門、後、死者用船上太平櫃安殮、傷者送醫院療治、昨日午後一時三刻、嘉禾駛還上海、船泊金利源新江天碼頭、楊警棺木由輪上岸時、上覆局旗、表示因公傷身、楊妻扶棺大哭、情極悽慘、受傷吳金印、亦隨船來滬、到埠後、局方將其送入醫院療治、船主大副等、均到局報告經過、船上船員之衣服銀錢、均被捲一空、各人到滬後、須另行購置衣件矣、船上來貨缷淸後、即停班入廠修理、</p>
<p>報告原文</p>
<p>該輪護航警班長蘇雲波·劉敬權·昨日向總局呈報被刦經過情形頗詳、覓錄原文如下、呈爲報告被刦情形事、竊於本月四日上午七時、由汕頭開往厦門、三時至六時落班、六時至九時、蘇班長帶同楊澤田·吳金印·上班、在汕頭上客之時、仍望照平時檢查男女客三十餘名、至八點五十分、不料發生海盗乘值班者不備、特將抱住腰間、值班者即拔槍射擊、而他一盗已先行開槍、值班者因被數盗挾牢、以致不能自由還擊、結果、楊澤田射中三槍殞命、吳金印中二槍受傷、而海盗僅一名足部受傷、楊吳之槍、遂被奪去、而即上領江台、脅廹船長大副交械、以及開往香港、否則全船犧牲、斯時劉班長聞聲帶同徐福林等、與餘盗抵敵、未幾兩盗押得大副來船尾部、命職等交械、劉班長等見前後已隔斷、且有大副亦在海盗中間、再行抵抗、則徒然犧牲全船生命財産、故即遵命交械、所有之槍、交與海盗之後、被數盗監視、他盗則任意搜刧、旅客船員、五日早六時船到汕尾、海海連開二槍、捉漁船一隻靠傍、將行李箱子等物一應搬下、約計旅客船員、被刧去現洋一千八百八十餘元、衣服不計、約值數百元之譜、綁去買辦沈欽祥·帳房李孝彬·葛良臣·至六時半、本船回頭復駛厦門、（下略）</p>

<h3>女甲跳高第一華東施藕卿姿勢</h3>
<p>— （葉長烈攝）</p>
<p>團體表演</p>
<p>昨日各校團體表演、共有十五節目、私立上中之單刀、開明中學之國術、俱見功夫、激發尚武精神不少、華東女中之健身操、道中女中之柔軟操、動作整齊美觀、姿態活潑可喜、上海幼師之幼稚園教材表演、耐人尋味、恰到好處、其他如惠羣女中之圓陣操、民智中學之粤國式健身操、市北中學之健身操、民生中學之彩旗操、亦頗整齊熟練、博得好評不少、</p>

<p>跑道瞭望</p>
<p>小江淸奈何病了</p>
<p>光華附中江淸、第一日曾到會參加、昨日未見蹤影、據説以生病請假、八百公尺中、光華不復再得問津矣、可惜、</p>
<p>陳明良回頭三看</p>
<p>二百公尺預賽時、陳明良將近終點、竟回頭連看三次、至影響成績僅二十五秒四、較葉海躊不如、寄語陳君、今後以不再回頭爲妙、</p>
<p>李松年取消資格</p>
<p>本　男甲百公尺、自董寅初不參加後、大夏李松年、原可出入頭地、不料昨日複賽時、竟以偷跑、取消資格、大夏同人、無不惋惜、</p>
<p>金仲康中途受挫</p>
<p>千五百瘃爲昨日最精采節目、第一組中金仲康、一路領先、辜秉後追隨其後、至最後一圈時、金仲康猛跌倒下、辜秉後超出二十公尺、金乃就地翻身、再行上道、至最後二十公尺時仍被衝出、難得難得、</p>
<p>方小姐前功盡棄</p>
<p>愛羣女中方瑞芳、五十公尺成績最好、大有冠軍把握、不料决賽時亦以偷跑被罰、至前功盡棄、方小姐幾乎哭了起來、</p>
<p>沙塲廵禮</p>
<p>男跳高張權得手</p>
<p>男甲跳高、浦東張權、仍能保持錦標、以以公尺六六獲第一、雖成績並不見佳、但跳高姿勢甚好、麥倫張申如、亦可造之才、</p>
<p>施藕卿未竟全功</p>
<p>華東施藕卿、平日跳高有一公尺三○二成績、昨日跳至一公尺二二五時、以民立徐静言已被屈服、冠軍已定、遂告結束、致未曾跳出最好紀錄、</p>
<p>張平復臨塲慌了</p>
<p>張平復之鉛球標槍、在女子甲組中、本是數一數二、昨日出塲、竟較平日差數公尺之鉅、致遭落選、望今日標槍中、好自爲之、</p>
<p>關小姐身肥體健</p>
<p>愛國關艷嬌、鉛球、標槍、爲女子乙組中之翹楚、昨日鉛球决賽、未失衆望、仍獲第一、關小姐、身體較前更肥、體力亦已增加矣、</p>

<p>會場花絮</p>
<p>女體跳高暗中摸索</p>
<p>昨日比賽完畢、已昏黑不辨五指、此時不料女體校跳高决賽、尚在暗中摸索、不曾完畢、裁判員記錄成績、以自來火擦後記之、其情形可見、完全以運氣决勝負、體校雖屬表演、似不應兒戲至是也、暗中跳高、亦可謂生面别開、</p>
<p>選手過磅景象凄慘</p>
<p>昨日爲大會第二日、已入於决賽時期、過磅處生意興隆、胡宗藩呌苦不止、每一選手度過磅之難關時、大多减少食量、裸頭洗足、祗剩短褲一條、瑟索之態、景象凄慘、邵汝幹見之、不禁憮然長嘆、</p>
<p>田徑塲外另一世界</p>
<p>昨日參觀人數、較第一日减少、復經童子軍理事會調來三百多名童子軍維持會塲、秩序大佳、但田徑圈外、則另一世界、攤販林立、生涯鼎盛、熙往攘來、别具一番景象、</p>
<p>交大學生摇旗呐喊</p>
<p>交大以地主關係、特闢司令臺之側端、爲該校學生席、黄呢制服、坐滿看臺、每見徑賽選手名列前茅者、輙呐喊助威、</p>
<p>蔣發令員今日請假</p>
<p>徑賽發令員蔣湘青、因事不克到會、申國權亦因率領交大學生赴杭旅行、不能蒞塲服務、故發令一職、已由蔣君商得大會當局之同意、今日請董承康君代理、</p>
<p>幼稚表演耐人尋味</p>

<h3>新式自動開關和調節器的構造原理</h3>
<p>— 宋劍琴</p>
<p>美國最近發明一種裝有新式自動開關和自動調節器的收音機，使用極爲便利，如預將調節盤排好，則全日的節目自能按時開唱，很是奇妙，這種收音機裏裝有自動音量控制，故各電台音量高低，都是一律的，現在把牠的構造原理詳述如下，</p>
<p>圖中W是一只小號電鐘，他的面部裝着一個特製的調節盤B，當B旋轉一週，須經十二小時，盤內週圍，共有四十八條槽孔，每條槽孔裏夾着一只滑鍵D，這滑鍵可任意上下，以便調節，R是較整B盤時間的旋鈕，K是裝在絶緣物I上的上條銅片，直列在B盤的裏面，大約相距一分，各片的一端都用導綫接到P盤的各綫釘上。</p>
<p>P盤是用膠木製的，盤的外面膠有兩片半圓形的金屬片XZ，兩片間有膠木O做牠們的絶緣物，O的闊度約爲一分，12345都是綫釘裝在絶緣的膠板上，這種綫釘是可以移動位置的，當移至目的地時，即可把牠旋緊，牠的一端構造好像波羅鋼筆尖一般，觸在P的金屬片上</p>
<p>當B轉到六點一刻鐘時，D適和KI相觸那時電流從小方棚TI流到X片上，再由綫釘I導到KI而至D鍵，因爲B和W都是金屬做的，所以電流由導綫6傳小馬達M的電刷上。更由他刷回至方棚，成一複雜的回路，交流電就往復在這回路裏流通着，因電流經過馬達裏的電動子時，A即向右旋轉。馬達上的小齒輪繼續由小傳大而到三連電容器的齒輪時。軸就慢慢向右旋轉起來。因爲P和三連電容器在同一軸上，所以同時亦隨之旋轉當絶緣綫O轉到綫釘I的接觸點時，電流即被隔絶，而馬達亦即停止。（按馬達由運動而停止本有惰性作用，因傳到軸上，變動極微，没有問題，）電容器亦同時中止，倘若電容器在這度數裏適爲某電台的週率時，收音機即可收得某電台的音樂了，</p>
<p>假使電鐘走到七點的時候，滑鍵D和K3相觸，那時綫釘3適觸在Y片上，因爲Y片所接着方棚的綫圈適和X的相反，故馬達即向左轉。其一切作用與前相同。不過方向相反吧了，</p>
<p>總而言之。凡通有電流的線釘，觸在X片上時，輪軸終向左旋轉，直到O和這線釘接觸時停止，倘若觸在Y片上時。其方向適和前相反。其動作和前相同。</p>
<p>又當TP指着七點一刻時。D和K5相觸，P盤向右旋轉，待O將與線釘5相觸時，（即電容器將近1500千週時。）軸上的横柄Q即將收音機的電源開關S開路，收音機停止工作，待C和線釘5相觸，馬達亦即停止，此時電源朴落不必拔去！機中所費的電流很微，不過電鐘裏電磁鐵G，和少許電流在小方棚和馬達的母磁綫圈子裏通過吧了。</p>
<p>當收音機自動開唱時，軸一轉動，Q即將S閉路，機裏燈絲均亮，待O至目的地時，音樂立即傳入了。</p>
<p>以上所述，不過是運用自動開關和調節情形。如果想聽臨時别種節目。那也極爲便當。祗須將N旋鈕推進旋轉即可。因N被推入時。推動鐵條H。更由J傳力到L上。軸上齒輪即被L推出，而脱離U輪。（如果没有這種裝置，則Z旋轉不易，因軸上齒輪與齒輪組Z相連，互相傳力於馬達上，而發生極大阻動力）。故旋轉亦很輕易，放開N，則其內部的彈簧自能將N彈出，而軸上齒輪亦由彈簧V回復其原有位置。</p>
<p>因以易於辨别起見，通常將導綫1,2,3,4,5,以紅，黄，藍，綠，白等色區别之，而B盤亦漆以同樣顔色，則綫路更爲明析了，</p>
<p>至於預先調排某綫釘爲某電台的波長的手續，亦極簡易，可將N推進調節至某電台的波長，或收到某電台音樂後，則機後P盤的O綫適在某地位，次將附近的綫釘移至O上旋緊即可，那末這綫釘就是能收某電台的音樂的了。</p>
<h3>高周放大的交連電路</h3>
<p>— 劉同康</p>
<p>普通高周率放大電路的交連法，可分爲下列三類：</p>
<p>（一）電阻交連法，</p>
<p>（二）變壓器交連法，</p>
<p>（三）混合阻力交連法，</p>
<p>現在且將牠們分别略述如後：</p>
<p>（一）電阻交連法　如圖一所示，此類交連法，其優點在無周率性，換言之，即對於各周率之放大，均極圓滑，而平匀，以前當三極管盛行時，因真空管內各極間電容量之關係，故不適用於收聽廣播與短波，（因高週率的損失太大）且至今仍然未被重視者，其原因有三，第一，因爲此式交連法，其放大率，僅能等於真空管的放大級數所以不得不加多級數，以增加其效力，第二，用電阻交連後，調節器减少，因之，選擇力亦有遜色，第三，此種交連法，需要高電壓，供給高放管之屏極；因爲要使高放的放大因數加大，不得不增大屏電路的電阻，故實際上，屏電路所接電阻等於真空管的屏電阻時，其放大因數，僅爲真空管放大因數之半，至電阻愈大，放大因數愈高，但屏極所受之電壓則愈少，所以又不得不利用加高屏電壓一法來補救，通常變通辦法，屏極所接電壓至少應等於屏壓的最大規定值，而屏極所接電阻的數值，以三倍於真空管的屏極混合阻力爲最宜（二）變壓器交通法　這種交連法又可分以下二種：</p>
<p>甲，自感圈變壓交連—此式交連法，其優點在乎對於真空管的放大率絲毫不損，而選擇性又佳，如圖二所示，因爲綫圈L儼如一單圈變壓器，故可將電壓昇高，而綫圈從分頭起至末端，儼如一初級圈，當屏流經過初級圈時，則全綫圈受其磁塲之變動，故引起電壓激勵次級，又因初次級交連極密，故其混合阻力極高，不以初級圈少而减低其靈敏度，但此交連法，應注意栅極電容器因其跨接於高壓電兩端，故非良品，不C克爲功。</p>
<p>乙，互感圈變壓交連普通收音機中，最流行之高放交連法，要推此式，其優點除却自感圈變壓交連法所具之優點外，即高放屏電路之電流永不令洩漏至檢波管栅極，而發生不良現象，又通常因四極管，五極管之屏阻極高，故初級圈之圈數又不得不較多，致使選擇力减弱，其補救方法可將初次級遠置或使之距離可調節，有時以一高周扼圈代替初級而置之於次級圈內接地綫處，但用者頗少如圖三。</p>

<h3>交流無綫電機電力測量法</h3>
<p>— 王懋生</p>
<p>不論交流電收音機或發音機，欲測其所需之電力、可用下法行之</p>
<p>較大之城市中，用電燈者必裝火表，火表所以測量電力、與時間之相乘積，任何火表，每一千瓦一小時Kwh，其轉盤所旋轉之次數，均已注明，如</p>
<p>利用上法則電機之電力，便能測得，將欲測之電機接上，而將房中所有電氣用具，一律關閉，測其每分鐘或十分鐘轉盤旋動之次數例如</p>
<p>上法不僅能測量電力；並可較騐阻流圈之自感量，及電源變壓器之優劣，</p>
<h3>更普遍的較騐器</h3>
<p>— 蔡日新</p>
<p>誰都知道較騐器最簡便的，就是一筒A電池同一隻小電珠或一付聽筒，但是不用電池電珠，凡裝有礦石機的的人，亦可以有一隻很好的較騐器；它的接綫如附圖。</p>
<p>我們的礦石機，不用綫圈電客器，單只用礦石同聽筒如圖一，豈不是也能收到聲音的嗎？那末我們就可以用這方法，把一綫分二頭做接觸頭，如圖二，把兩接觸頭去碰另件的兩頭，就可以證明這另件有没有毛病；若這另件是應該連接的，如綫圈變壓器真空管的燈絲等，聽筒中有聲音，那就表示没有斷綫，是好的；若是本不連接的，如電容器等，聽筒中有了聲音，表示碰片，不響那就是好的，但在較騐的時候，應該注意，先把二接觸頭試接一下，聽筒中有聲音，然後可以較騐另件有没有毛病，否則實是較騐器的接綫有斷，倒去怪另件有毛病，胡亂地動手，反而把另件弄壞。</p>
<h3>無綫電廣播事業在日本（續）</h3>
<p>— 蔡光華</p>
<p>日本無綫電收音機的製造和販賣，仍舊是在私營商人手裏的，不過有幾種出品，是被恊會當局承認和奬勵的，同時，每年另件和整個機械輸出的數目，也很可驚。</p>
<p>眼睛瞎的人，殘廢的人，以及公衆機關如學校等等，都可以請求免付收音費，兹善性質的醫院，窮苦者的寄宿舍，公家的公園等處，都由恊會方面，出資設置義務收音機。</p>
<p>熱鬧的城市裏，都有『日本放送恊會相談所』的設立，各種關於無綫電的常識以及收音機的修理等等，都可以免費委託他們。（待續）</p>

<p>春秋秋遊特刊</p>
<h3>前奏</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鷗</p>
<p>上星期六出了一次「菊與蟹」特刋，承一般看菊吃蟹的朋友們謬相稱許，很爲高興。第二天恰值星期日，便和東吳中學孫藴璞沈祖懋張夢白諸先生與范烟橋程小青徐澐秋范菊高諸文友，作正儀吃蟹青陽港看菊之行，順便又到崑山暢遊馬鞍山半繭園，小隊登臨，自有一番賞心樂事。馬鞍山雖小，而大樹怪石，亦自楚楚可觀。倘能斬荆除棘，東崖種梅，西崖種桃，加以一番整理；那麽定可吸收上海無數遊客，於農村經濟上不無小補，願崑山人士注意一下。遊罷歸來，積悶俱消，因便選取諸文友秋遊作品，再來一個「秋遊特刋」，以助讀者遊興。當此五省公路行將工成之日，農村經濟正告破産之際，願大家節省都會中淫樂之費，趁著秋高氣爽，出去玩水遊山，和大自然接近接近，於己於人，都可得益不少。</p>
<h3>天平看楓葉</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>這幾天，蘇州平添了許多雅人，都要到天平山去看楓葉了。的確！天平山的楓葉，是值得一看的。蔡雲的吳欽云：『賞菊山塘尚勝游，一年游興盡於秋，天平十月看楓約，只合詩人坐竹兜。』過了這個機會，朔風漸緊，彤雲欲密，便不能駕言出游了。雅人們到了天平山，看了楓葉的殷紅，一定感到唐人詩：『霜葉紅於二月花。』是够味的。可是切莫錯過了天平山下田疇裏的稻的憔悴可憐之色。同時還得看看邪許聲聲抬八卦轎的，是不是面有葉色？因爲今年的蘇州農村，遭着旱荒，他們眼裏，照見享樂的雅人，想到甕頭的：『空空如也，』兩眼裏怕要滴下血來，和楓葉比一比顔色，誰來的煊紅呢？所以雅人們有力來看楓葉，在和抬轎的論價的時候，慷慨一點罷。</p>
<p>説這些話，未免敗興，我來凑個趣罷。要是看楓葉，以天平山下高義園側三太師墳前—俗呼范墳最好，那是有名的九枝紅，因爲有九株楓樹，都是挺丈的幹子，葉兒生發得密密地。顧鐵卿的淸嘉錄也説過：『非花鬥妝，不春爭色。遠近楓林，無出其右。』</p>
<p>除掉這一處以外，野生的楓樹也很多。李悔廬天平山看楓葉記云：『縱目雞籠諸山，楓林遠近，紅葉雜松際。冒霜則葉盡赤，天氣微暖，霜未着樹，紅葉參錯，顔色明麗，可愛也。』我們坐在兼山閣下，望見諸多綠色中間夾雜幾堆紅色，使綠色更形蒼老，紅色更形鮮艷。但是，我總以爲春花的紅，是少女；霜葉的紅，是少婦。罪過！罪過！朱竹詫有詩云：『年年秋色照丹楓。』他把楓葉象徵着我家老祖宗的公忠體國呢。</p>
<p>慚愧得很！我住在蘇州十幾年，到過天平六七回，却從來没有見過楓葉的霜紅。今年更没有這心緒去看，只好從許多雅人的筆底，間接的領略一點了。</p>
<h3>大場風景綫</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>假使用遊覽名山大川的眼光去遊覽偏僻的鄉村，那無異從影戲院出來再　西洋鏡，當然是大失所望的。我到大塲去，帶着異趣的心目，因爲没有探訪名勝古蹟的慾念，所以却意外地使我得到滿意。</p>
<p>大塲姚邨塘的丹楓，是最使我留戀的，紫紅色的枝葉，這兒一株，那兒一株，站在净潔的溪岸上，倚在褐色的籬笆邊，遠遠望去，紫霞呢，那麽凝固在初冬的粉藍的天幕上似的。假使我是個天才的詩人，没凖兒會在這裏寫出百首流利的抒情詩。用閒情的歩子踱到西鎭梢，像半鈎新月般的玉龍橋便會雅緻地躺在眼前，溪水有勁没勁地流着，撞在橋腿上，亦會喘出一些輕微的聲息。點一支淡味的烟捲傍着橋欄，隨意流覽；北面，掩隱在墨綠色的深林裏的，是古舊的法界寺，寺前有顆大銀杏，枝葉高抓着天，幾十圍抱粗的枝桿。南面：是有着幽嫻的姚家庵，紅牆上蓋着青色瓦片，會給一些俗人們滌除塵垢的田野風，常常把屋簷下那盞門燈吹蕩起來，有着素樸的少婦的耳垂子的風姿。</p>
<p>到過寳華禪院，會使醉心洋化的人覺得東方古國的建築藝術亦並不壞，雕樑畫棟，金碧輝煌。地位一百多畝，亭臺樓閣前後牽連，像走進了中世紀的王者宫殿一般，院中西部有放生塲，鵝，鴨，鷄，牛，羊，猪……都被一些慈善家放生在裏面，牲畜們在這裏得了生之保障，高興地嗚呌着。院的中央有鏡湖，湖心亭就臨空托在上面，朱色匾額上「訓然」兩個字是金色的。傍晚時光登亭樓看晚霞和落日，自然的影色統收在眼底了。湖水在没風的時候，平静如鏡，樹木倒影，彷彿湖中亦别有一番天地。玻璃框中的風景畫吧？</p>
<p>雖然在大塲没有名勝和古蹟。田野，竹籬茅舍，幽静的鎭街，隱士風的一切，已足够我流連忘返了。吃慣粗魚大肉的不能不吃點蔬菜瓜菓，那麽遊歷過名山大川的旅人，似乎亦不必放棄這偏僻而有逸趣的鄉村呢。</p>
<h3>蘇州的雙塔</h3>
<p>— （范劍威攝）</p>
<h3>湖上的秋夜</h3>
<p>— 費瑪</p>
<p>當那一個凉秋的月夜，我們摇了一葉扁舟，在銀波蕩漾的湖上，輕輕地遊着。</p>
<p>半圓形的月亮，掛在蔚藍的天幕上，兩旁小堤邊蓊鬱的樹林，好似牽繞着濛濛的夜霧，只見烟也似的一團團了，明月的光輝充實地瀉注在湖面，像銀屑一般地閃爍啊。</p>
<p>我們的扁舟，輕輕地，緩緩地，在湖面上徘徊，那灰暗而幽静的湖上喲，除了槳聲水韻，和着白鷗們飛翔的翼音，找不着一點别的聲息，夜神支配着的沉默的湖面，是特别顯示着偉大與莊嚴，而我們的一葉扁舟又是如何的覺得渺小呢？</p>
<p>啊！静的湖，睡夢中的湖，飛着那一羣一羣的白鷗，輕馳着我們的孤舟，在這樣一個寂寞的宇宙裏。</p>
<p>茫茫的世界，原來就是這一葉孤舟，幾雙白鷗，半邊凉月點綴着嗎？那這世界未免太凄沉，太落寞了，多愁善感的我啊，在這時，不禁感慨地低吟着。唉！真是一擬把傷心問明月，空將憂意付離騷。……」</p>
<p>白鷗翩翩地飛去了，和着明月的光輝，一同隱没於深沉的夜霧中。</p>
<p>啊！秋夜的寳盒裏，原來藴藏着這般一個奥妙的境界，沉静的湖水薰染着無限的幽懷；秋夜的湖上啊！真如一首寂寞的詩呢。</p>
<p>這秋湖上，只一葉小小的孤舟，載着我們幾個悲秋的遊人，在其中悠悠地蕩漾着。</p>
<h3>江灣的秋朝</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>刧後的江灣，依然呈露着蕭瑟的創痕，幸虧本市行政最高機關市政府，建設在市中心區，粉飾了不少昇平氣象，爲着生活掙扎的人們，不斷地往來於江灣道上；那裏又有幾所著名的學府，它們雖然同是刦後的災黎，可是經它們主持者的努力復興，倒也把蕭瑟的江灣，點綴的像個「依然故我」；蜿蜒數里的體育會路，翔殷路，都把握在江灣的紙掌中；早晨的空氣，十分淸新，雖然比不上莫干山，廬山，那般高曠，可是却勝過市纒繁關的一些所謂療養院了；曉霧迷濛中，看到朝暉由近的電桿木遠的濃蔭樹梢，慢慢爬下來，以至遼闊的田園，空廣的郊野；秋雖然是深了，樹葉兒猶未焦黄，可是淡淡的一層薄霜，淸早已觸到人們的眼簾，晨曦普照得逾遍，那麽這層薄霜，便受到不可抗力的侵凌了；從凝結的冰體，溶化成無數的露珠兒，這時候路旁的樹幹，迎日的重垣，活似熱淚交流！水烟四起！滾到馬路的高處，蔓延到溝渠的低處。</p>
<p>江灣不見「倒老爺」的踪跡，瞧不到聽不到轟轟的糞車；遠遠的聽到鷄鳴犬吠，馬路上有學習騎術的馬蹄聲，訓練競走的跑歩聲；經濟的學生們，認洗染作需費太奢，包給左近的浣衣婦，這個早晨，伊們很活躍，小脚零丁，挈着，肩着，成堆的衣服被褥，準備竭伊們的精力，換一日廐茶淡飯之資；小販阿金，風雨無阻，在這個早晨喚賣大餅油條聲聲刺耳欲聾！那種悽楚的情調；正和「開開金龍手」隔着一層壁呀。</p>
<h3>秋遊勝處</h3>
<p>— （瘦鵑）</p>
<p>秋遊勝處，遍江浙皆是也；而欲求其時間經濟，兩不糜費者，則吾獨數蘇州。天平靈巖，固足流連，即虎邱楓橋，亦良不惡。兹特掇拾昔人秋遊佳什，以引遊客，湖山大好，曷興乎來。</p>
<p>虎邱　寺門歸路柳隄東，十月繁霜唳早鴻，好是日斜人去後，一天紅葉下西風。</p>
<p>楓橋　碧江紅樹晚蕭蕭，蘆荻花中一葉飄，明月滿船天在水，數聲柔艣過楓橋。</p>
<p>天平　身在雲中不見雲，登臨忘却日將曛，回頭欲辨來時路，只有泉聲隔樹聞。</p>
<p>靈巖　振衣同上落虹亭，古塔雲深入杳冥，香徑草荒秋露白，山村處處暮烟青，天空一雁來胥口，木落諸峰見洞庭，莫向西風更懷古，菱歌淸絶起遥汀。</p>
<h3>金華雙龍洞</h3>
<p>— 棲霞樓主</p>
<p>坐了白帕竹轎，一路從金華縣城來，太陽爬得很高，那北山全籠在銀灰色的午霧裏了。這是一座非常秀麗的雲嵐，那上面有着三個著名的石洞，最上的是朝真，中部的是冰壺，山麓的就是雙龍。</p>
<p>洞前村歇了一回脚，把衣服脱輕了，穿着草鞋，拿了火把，便一口氣尋雙龍洞去。半路上已聽得山溪裏的泉聲。離洞五六箭路，就聽見亂葉封没的曲溝裏，噴出兩列瀑布，在太陽光中有如碎銀子般的飛着。</p>
<p>那是一個鐵甕似的大洞，可容六七百人，洞口張開，足有五六丈高，洞上刻着「三十六洞天」幾個大字，洞口左邊，斜出一支石龍。右邊本來也有一支，爲了風雨剝殘，現在是毁滅了。這就是名喚『雙龍』的由來。洞裏立有明朝萬歷年間王宋沐的碑文，説得很明晰，而且説六朝詩人劉孝標曾在朝真洞講過經。</p>
<p>洞分內外兩部份，外洞全照着陽光，有幾個守洞的農人在那兒談天。一見我們到，立刻迎出來問：『不打算入內洞去嗎？』説得背着手，領我們走到一條從內洞流出來的泉澤邊來。這泉澤裏滿流着黝黑的水，發出細小的淸響，但不能知道究竟從何處來，逝向何處去。</p>
<p>守洞的站住，用手指點着澤中的小船，這船很像山陰的採蓮盆，他告訴我們，要進內洞，必須直挺　挺地僵臥在船腹裏，不許動一動，一動就要觸着岩石，任那守洞的人用繩子拉將進去。……</p>
<p>然而我想：這打通內外洞的界綫，乃是山脚下的一個岩穴。這岩穴上下縱横四面都不滿四尺，萬一我躺在船上，給送進了另一世界，那裏飛着大黑翅的蝙蝠，游着粗壯的蟒蛇，奔走着身披綠髮的山魈！</p>
<p>可是，小船停留在澤畔，我親見另一個農夫，照樣躺在船上，給拖送了進內洞去，立刻就不見了。小船又拖出外洞來。</p>
<p>這還有什麽可推辭的理由呢？我難道不能和别人一樣去採訪一下謎似的洞？於是我跨上小船，真的像死骸似的，横在水上，只覺眼前一黑，全身流出來一層凉意，而水聲又汨汨的細語，我是全失去了眼睛的作用，雖然我還有眼睛；因爲包圍周遭的是看不見的無窮的暗黑！</p>
<p>只聽得有人在呌：『上來吧！到了。』然而我不信這是人聲，人聲决没有這麽陰鬱。等我細細看時，才見在黑霧中閃動着一穗火光，光照處，立着剛才先進來的農人。</p>
<p>我立刻從船上跳起，由農人的牽曳，才走上了沙泥和水的石岸，草鞋浸在水裏，於是我也燒了火把。這爝火，真是藐小，只能照見三歩以內的人面。等同性全到，火把全亮，便開始廵遊完了這個鐘乳異態的黑暗世界。</p>
<p>那洞內的大石坪，足有一畝田那麽闊，然而要上去，因爲離穹窿低，人必須像龜也似的用雙手上爬，腹部緊靠滑石，才能濟事從石坪走下，一直摸進去，流着一潭青碧的水窪，可以赤脚在窪裏走，這就是龍潭。</p>
<p>至於石鐘乳有的像纓絡似的掛着，有的像龍螭似的盤着，有的像鸞鳳似的翔着，其狀不一，各極其態，所相類的，那鐘乳都白得如雪，明得如礬，真是可貴之至。如果要詳知這洞內裏的鐘乳形態，我願大家看一遍宋朝大儒謝臯羽的『金華洞人物古跡記，』便一目瞭然了。</p>

<h3>再談「吳下諺聯」</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>一個月以前，我在自由談發表「諺語的記錄」一文，提到吳下諺聯，隨後金祖同君發表「關於吳下諺聯」一文，説是這部稀見（？）的書他有，又過了幾天，承他送來借給我看，書葉略有蟲蛀，另加襯葉裱好，字句不曾殘缺。—我真是歡喜極了。</p>
<p>這部書四卷，分裝四本。作者王有光，字觀國，號北莊，青浦人。又號青浦素史，那是因爲他撰集諺聯到最後一副：</p>
<p>來得早，洗頭湯；來得遲，洗渾湯。</p>
<p>淸明前，掛金錢；淸明後，掛銅錢。</p>
<p>恰在嘉慶四年淸明前十日，太上皇死了，有詔除紅，他就換去色聯，用素箋題一門聯道：</p>
<p>普天率土含悲處，</p>
<p>復旦重華仰頌時。</p>
<p>聯尾自署青浦素史臣王有光，大約他是由一個翰林出身，得過淸朝的好處，感激涕零，那是當然的。於是他「湧淚投筆，自是不復續聯。」吳下諺聯就在這里絶筆了。</p>
<p>王老先生究竟做過什麽官呢？我想在青浦縣志裏總可以找到。在他諺聯絶筆的這一年正月初一日，是他的六十生朝。他在自述詩裏説道：</p>
<p>獨子單承依古禮，</p>
<p>兩房兼繼荷皇恩。</p>
<p>原來他是以獨子「遵恩例兼繼兩房宗祧」的，所以他不得不感激皇恩了！因此我們知道他確曾做過官。此外，他的事跡我就不知道。</p>
<p>諺聯共分啟目，正目，續目，末目四類，約占卷一的篇幅五分之二。從此以下，都是解釋這些諺語的意義，故事，來源。他爲什麽要著這部書呢？他在卷四解釋「磨日光」一語時説道：</p>
<p>人生無過百年，天有日光，人有工夫，一任過而不留，即果享壽百年，亦安見此百年中有此人哉？惟以吾工夫挨此日光，過一日細細地磨一日，得之耳目，會之心思，形之筆墨，後之覽者，估其日光，想見其爲人，較之悠悠忽忽而過者，自有記認之處，知某年某月某日，有某某力爲之磨也。粉麪之磨以磑則細，斧斤之磨以石則利，楩楠之磨以水則澤，著述之磨以日光則壽。素史氏集諺聯在於嘉慶元年，擱筆年餘，然於路上船上枕上，輒難消遣晝夜，仍於街談巷語，探得人情物理，未嘗不記於心，偶或錄之，今又成帙矣，亦不放此日光經過也。</p>
<p>呵呵！王老先生撰集吳下諺聯，原是晚年消遣，借此磨日光的。他説「著述之磨以日光則壽」，究竟他這部書是不是壽世不朽之作呢？據他的曾孫之勳愼容在補刻這部書的序文裏説：</p>
<p>是書參詩史遺意，以美刺寓勸懲，發人深省。先以俗語開講，較勸善書更容易親近，實足備醒世格言一則。刻自嘉慶庚辰，流傳頗廣。</p>
<p>可見這部書在當時是很流行的，大約真是把牠當做「善書」「格言」一類書看待。如今我們要從謡俗學上來看，當然又是一番意義了。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>不過王老先生很懂得閲讀者的心理，他不只顧教訓人，像「勸善書」「醒世格言」一類東西，枯燥無味，迂腐可笑，他的這部書雖是教人的，却很感人，可以起碼當得起「開卷有益，掩卷有味」八個字的評語。也的啟目三聯是：</p>
<p>開盤笑，十樣錦，歩歩高，</p>
<p>回味甜。百醜圖。隻隻好。</p>
<p>每句下面附有解釋，兼以説明他編這部書的宗旨及其技巧。解釋開盤笑一語道：</p>
<p>吳下婚禮，聘時裝潢和合二仙入盤，主人啟盒，瞥見歡天喜地，諺稱開盤笑。昔人謂小試作文，開講落題，貴有生趣動人，亦以開盤笑擬之。竊見輯書者先序文，次凡例，繼之以目錄，正文未入，閲者色倦矣。僕集諺語，一標目即足解頤，是爲開盤笑。</p>
<p>可見他編這部書，起頭就想要抓住讀者的心理。又解釋回味甜一語道：</p>
<p>文章最忌一層頭，毛詩賦興比豈一覽可盡？立説者須引人入勝，如食青子，始而澀口，繼如嚼蠟，後且回甘，名之曰諫果，言者無罪，聞者足以戒也。僕註釋諺語，使街頭巷議多作格言，是爲回味甜。</p>
<p>他這部書所以能够引人入勝，是教訓和趣味二者兼顧的。至於他説「擬之曰十樣錦，集中嘉言懿行似之。」「擬之曰百醜圖，集中含譏寓諷者似之。」也很説得實在。又解釋歩歩高一語道：</p>
<p>曰諺，則字或參差；曰聯，則文必齊截。本集自二字起，至三字四字五字六字，計至十二字止，由少而多，自短而長，挨次錄之，若歷階然，故曰歩歩高。</p>
<p>這就是他把諺聯怎樣排列的方法了。又解釋隻隻好一語道：</p>
<p>文曰篇，詩曰首，歌曲曰隻，諺歌曲類也，亦曰隻，素史氏錄而註焉，俗者雅之，腐者新之，有典實者考核之，俾披閲之下，莊者取其醇正，諧者賞其風流，各適其可，故曰隻隻好。</p>
<p>那些諺語雖然未必真像他説的隻隻好，好的很多，那是不待説了。</p>
<p>至於他在每隻諺語所下的解釋，大半是采取民間傳説，如鍾馗吃小鬼，羅漢請彌陀，天下有空青，來字作去字話，瓦罐不離井上破，牡丹不帶娘家土，無事不登三寳地，陰地不如心地好，他的這些解釋都是謡俗學上很可寳貴的材料。吳下諺聯一書的價值就在這里了。</p>
<h3>冬天的南海之濱</h3>
<p>— 李三郎</p>
<p>初冬已帶着霜冷底氣息的上海，輕微地煽起了旅人回憶底情調。窗紗給浸透人們底心胸的風吹蕩着，飄飄地，那麽凄切的呵！</p>
<p>南國的冬天是可愛的，去年，我們在靠近南海之濱的一個荒野里過着耕種的生活，三個從家庭跳出來的年輕人那麽愉快地幹着一個農塲呵！冬天的海水還帶着一點秋意的，我們天天是那麽美妙地把身子浸在水中，捕魚呵！挑水澆菜呵！談天呵！鋤土呵！燒飯呵！每天的時間是那麽地消磨着的。過了半個冬天，我幹過一個多月的農夫生活才離開的。</p>
<p>冬天的南國是温柔的，比不得北方那麽樣嚴寒，雪的襲擊着大地，人們大都躱在屋子里的。可是，我們在南國的時候，只消穿着一點的衣裳，在那一陣一陣的海風里飄蕩着。有時，我們駕着自備的小魚船從農塲里駛到南海的邊去。那忐忑的波濤有時給我們吃怕的，活像一片葉子的小船確受不過那可怕的大浪。我們掉進葦蘆里，在那兒静地瞧着岸上一片的田野，老遠的火輪在海面飄流，還有那一雙一雙的海鳥不斷地從明朗的天空灣到浪花面上捕捉小魚。蔚藍色的天空温柔地射出來的太陽光綫，我們更熱烈地談笑。這是多麽可愛的自然世界里的詩意底生活呵！輕輕地，輕輕地，我們又掉回農塲里，弄飯呵！工作呵！那麽快樂地過着我們的日子。</p>
<p>白天，我們除了工作以外，我常常獨個兒穿着草鞋兒在田塲上流浪着，那時泥濘的阡陌小徑上常常跑着小孩子們，男的女的都是那麽愉快的，像没有悲哀，他們没曉得世界上的不幸地的游玩着，有時爭吵起來，我也加入他們的陣圍勸解，還要講一些有趣的故事給他們聽。這樣，他們非常快樂地到我們的農塲里來玩，差不多我們的小狗兒也樂得和他們混在一起玩的。鄉村的小孩子是野而可愛的。</p>
<p>冬天的南國没有雪，所以，許多孩子聽到雪的故事就莫明其妙地歪着腦袋和放射出懷疑的眼光。我告訴他們：</p>
<p>「雪好像軟棉一樣的從天空降下來，霎時便把世界變得白銀一樣，那些小孩子們便做雪戲，製雪人，多有趣的呵！」</p>
<p>于是，他們笑，他們幻想着雪的可愛了。然而現在我又流浪到這雪的世界來了，那白雪快要把世界變得嚴寒的，可怕的了。那南國的温柔，海濱的可愛的生活，給我多麽深重的懷憶哪。</p>
<h3>母親就没有那一份幸福</h3>
<p>— 揚帆</p>
<p>做父母的對於「頭生」和「末生」，往往總是特别鍾愛的。然而比較起來，對「頭生」的鍾愛又往往是暫時的，而對「末生」的鍾愛却都是永久的。其間的原因也很簡單，大兒子娶了，大女兒嫁了，親蜜的成分是必然會逐漸减少的。小兒子小女兒便不同，他們有一個較長的追隨雙親的時間。「天下父母喜小兒，」那的確是做父母的人的非常坦率的供詞。</p>
<p>抱着「嫁出女兒潑出水」那頑固見解的人，她當然是更愛小兒子的。但普通以氣質上的關係，做母親的人却總是鍾愛小女兒的。那是因爲女兒能够依頭順腦，聽話，服差遣，聰慧一點的還能安慰母親苦悶時的心情。所以「掌上珠」三字，我們是頗爲熟悉的。</p>
<p>但是母親却來信説：「十六日我又養了一個小女，年荒世亂，我們成人的生活也已極難維持，那里還有安閒工夫來撫育這小孩子呢？所以，産後兩天，便呌人送到育嬰堂裏去。…」不錯，母親是已經四十七歳了，在結凍天還要洗尿布，在大雪天還要墊灰袋，也確已是一件不能勝任的受罪的事情！送掉，雖則母親的慈心將受到極深極重的刺激，然而有什麽法子呢，在這年頭兒成年人都無法活命呵！</p>
<p>母親的生活經騐當然並不狹仄，她該早曉得在年邁的時候有個小囡隨身扶持，是一種無上的幸福咧。然而在她，—在目下破碎的家庭，就不允許存有那樣的奢望；委實我們太窮了，家庭窮，兒子也窮，一條小生命的撫育培養，是决不如養鷄養狗一樣簡單的。除了供給最低限度的衣食之外，還要加上難以計算的時間。母親明白了這一層，所以她竟忍心地那樣做了！</p>
<p>然而，帶了些殘酷呢，鄉下人呌送育嬰堂不是呌「送死堂」的嗎？—這問題怎樣才能兩全？我慚愧自己没有兩全的能力。</p>
<p>馬路上常常看到許多年輕的小姐扶持着年老的太太走，母親就没有那一份幸福！她什麽都明白，她既然那樣做，我想勸阻，但又没有勸阻的勇氣。</p>
<p>看到母親簡樸的字，我寗静的心又惘然了。</p>
<h3>江湖客（三）</h3>
<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>價錢便宜，平常兩塊錢也未必到手。現在一塊，八毛，五毛！四毛：因爲短了盤川。但等他將價格一直降落到一角錢一顆，生意仍不見熱鬧。</p>
<p>烏鴉在車站紅色建築物的尖頂上盤旋。低垂的帽沿再也遮不住陽光照着那雙有光的小眼時，人已經走盡。他嘆息着，收拾起褡褳，向四周狡獪的掃一眼。他也要走了。</p>
<p>背影和他的生意一樣蕭條。走得異常迂緩，一些閒散人追上了他，又趕過去，他毫不注意。頭微微低垂，睨視着夕陽下淡淡的影子。雙肩一高一低，互相爭持，看去是一個患過風濕症的跛子。</p>
<p>一個醉漢模樣的人，抓住也的肩膀，拚命摇撼着。兇狂的眼釘在他類乎蔴菰的骯髒的臉上，大聲嚷道：</p>
<p>「老客！明兒天津衛到的罷，明兒？」</p>
<p>他向傍邊閃開一歩，卑怯的笑着。那冷然的笑，恰適合於貶眼和聳動着的鬍子。他用食指戳着偏右的鼻端，看看田野，再看看那醉醺醺的臉，似乎要在其找出一個比較。他却不説什麽。</p>
<p>「大盌吃酒，山東出「响馬，」哈哈……天津衛好地方，去罷，鬼子挖出你的良心配蒙汗。去罷，騙子！」</p>
<p>那人推了他一把，哈哈笑着，踉踉蹌蹌走了。嘴裏胡亂唱着猥䙝的曲子，發出豬一樣的聲音。他幾乎跌一交。也並不説什麽話，只是摇着的頭更低下去了。在鼻子上抹一把，像一個頂寛大，唯一担憂着世間苦惱的人，吱咕着。又繼續走前去。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談誇大</h3>
<p>— 永泊</p>
<p>誇大狂實際上就是吹，也可以呌作吹牛。</p>
<p>誇大狂和真實性是一個對立的東西。事實一經舖張，一經誇大，就不會再是真實的事實了。所以，會誇大的人决非老實人，而老實的人也决不會誇大的。請認淸楚，不是不想，是不會。以是，我們可以説：誇大實在是一種藝術。</p>
<p>譬如你不能繪聲繪色，把某一人物或某一故事舖叙得曲折動聽，神氣活現，使聽的人能够信而不疑，不知你的舖叙祇是三真七假的一些語言的玩意，那你便是没有誇大的藝術。反之，你能够繪聲繪色的講，人家能够信而不疑的聽那你便是謊騙的成功，有誇大的藝術的。</p>
<p>談到謊騙，和誇大的涵義又復不同了；謊騙是杜撰了一個故事去欺騙人家，誇大却祗是把一件細小的故事擴而充之，或把平凡的故事，改編得有聲有色</p>
<p>一部份人的意見，以爲出門走走，總得帶上三分牛。他們怕陌生人不熟悉自身有多大的本領，於是乎想表現自己，介紹自己，製造個機會替自己吹一下。不過吹起來也得有個分寸，人面前説人話，鬼面前説鬼話，最要緊的是鑒貌辨色，看風轉舵，不然，牛屁而吹豁了邊，那是當塲出醜，十分坍台的事情！</p>
<p>所以，即使只是三分牛，吹起來也還是需要技術的，這就是誇大的由來了</p>
<p>青年時期是犯誇大狂的毛病犯得頂頂利害的一個時期，大概總不外由於年少氣盛，世故未深的緣故。我們日夕所最易碰到的，約有兩種人物：一種是作政治活動的人，相見之下，你無需乎問他，他會自動的告訴你某中委某主席的一連串誇大話，那些，自然只好一笑置之。另一種是所謂文學青年，又是某作家某作家的一連串，對於那些話，我們自然也只好一笑置之了。</p>
<p>打一句話説，誇大狂縱使不是極壞的事情，也决不會是好的事情，敗事則有餘，成事則不足！</p>
<h3>宴</h3>
<p>— 甲辰</p>
<p>女主人忙着招應來客，穿梭似的，雖是在薄有輕寒之意的初冬之夜，而她的鼻尖上邊已滲出幾顆汗珠來。</p>
<p>房子裏：白色的床巾，白色的粉壁，白色的水銀的燈光蕩漾着。她穿的又是一副白色的點花旗袍子，她彷彿一隻輕俏靈活的白色的羽的燕子了。今天她是應該那麽興奮的，爲因今天是孩子滿年的　日。她興奮到忘記了自己是個二十五歳的母親了。今夜她整個地回復到了自有了男人以後便失掉了的少女的熱情姿態。一種輕佻没有介蒂的舉動。隨便拍着那個男客的肩膊調趣：</p>
<p>—小張，你亦應當有個女人了，怎麽老是打單，不感到寂寞嗎？</p>
<p>給呌着小張的嘟起嘴，抹抹鬼臉：</p>
<p>—你肯跟我「拉」就得啦。</p>
<p>於是一陣朗亮的笑聲就湧了上來。不只女主人忘記了自己是有着母親的身份的人，每個客人亦一樣忘記了她是有了男人的女人，各各那末無遮無攔的談呀説的。</p>
<p>幾乎被自己的女人所遺忘同時被客人所遺忘的男主人，他孤獨地躺在臨窗邊的一隻沙發上，十分無聊地抽着烟捲，瞧着眼前的情形，聽着人家的話語。一種莫明其妙的作惡的情緒爬上心頭，他微微感到幾分不稱意。他覺得女人不該在自己跟前做出那種近似放浪的動作，説話不説話，却還用着手去觸到男客的身體上，這總有點看不過的。而男客更不該説着差不多是越禮的話，可是大家都自如自在的亂拉扯。那簡直還不是對自己一種蔑視的意思。爲要表示男子固有的尊重性，他很想開口説幾句話，給點暗示，可讓大家曉得是　男主人在那里，别那末胡市下去。他蠕動了好幾次嘴唇，可是話到嘴沿又嚥下去。他不知道怎樣説得出，他説不出來，他感到有些慌。</p>
<p>然而别人分明是看不着他躺在那裏似的，連自己的女人。</p>
<p>入座的時候，大家才起始發見他一樣的拉着他，他毫没一絲笑容的佔了一個位子。於是又臨到鬥酒的一幕了。</p>
<p>只有他半點提不起興緻，也不喝酒，可是没誰曉得他此時懷着什麽心事，祗他自己明白。</p>
<p>可是旁邊的人仍然瞧着他有如瞧不着的任意説，任意動。</p>
<p>而頂有勁兒的還是女主人，她瞇着</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>桃紅色的笑臉，手裏擎着杯子，敬了這個，又敬了那個，一個輪過一個，逢那個不願喝的，她便同時動起手來，一邊把杯子凑近男子的嘴巴上，一邊揪着男子的頸脖，一定要他喝下去不可…。</p>
<p>男主人幾乎没勇氣再看，他想一鼓氣搶掉那隻杯，把女人抓住揍一頓，把男客通趕出去，才洩得胸頭的忿惡。但是他怎麽着亦做不出，不外想想。而且只好將眼睛轉了方向。如受活罪的兀自坐在那裏。</p>
<p>酒裝下肚子裏，起了作用，大家都紅着眼珠，有些醉醺醺的様子，話説的嗓子起高，越無忌憚，越失去平常的神態了。</p>
<p>而且便有人離開座位，踏着地板跳起狐歩舞來，也有張開咽喉大唱着曲子的。於是就有個提議：</p>
<p>—跳舞去，好不好。</p>
<p>這聲音尚且是女主人説出來的。不用説回答的都説好。</p>
<p>看模樣，愈來愈不對勁了。主人的男人氣得心底冒火，他已經忍得再無可忍的時候，他站到女人的面前，帶着責備的口吻説：</p>
<p>—别太放任，還是快點回去，家裏的孩子在等着你哩。</p>
<p>説後也不向其他的招呼便一跨腿冲出門去了。</p>
<p>女人却一點也不在乎。</p>
<p>房子裏仍繼續着不停的笑聲和説話聲，和女人悠揚的歌聲。</p>
<h3>大學生與舞女</h3>
<p>— 黄嘉音作</p>
<h3>風化與生活</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>林美英和她的同伴給幾個穿着一同式樣的天青色的服裝的人們，毫無容情地給裝進停在門口的黑色的大卡車裏面去。這時，她真有點莫名其妙，他們到底要把她送到那兒去，爲的是什麽事情？</p>
<p>從三四層樓的屋頂瀉下來的深秋的夜風，吹拂到美英的身上，使她頓時地感覺得寒冷，連骨子裏也都隱約地冷起來，颯索地發抖着。</p>
<p>林美英坐在黑漆的卡車裏，卡車不住顛簸地前進着，她老不轉睛地把視綫直望着鐵絲窗外沿馬路的商店的晶亮亮的電炬，但她底心却很憂鬱地在回味着剛上車的時候，從許多觀衆的口裏説出來的這句奇異的話：「捉野鷄呀！」究竟「野鷄」是什麽意思呢？這個名辭在新從破産的農村裏出來的林美英不消説聽起來是怪生疎的，她三番屢次要想説出聲來打壞這像死般的沉静悶人的空氣，請教着和她同來的招弟姊，然而她從每個人的面部的表情看來，就可以知道她們都各帶着一顆壓着千斤重的石頭似的憂悶的心情，終於她只得把這個問題暫時地擱置到肚子裏去了。</p>
<p>林美英是一個天真活潑而又年紀輕輕的鄉村姑娘，一向是跟着她的爸爸在鄉間種田的。可是，她對於繁榮的上海，却時時地在做着理想的幻夢。她從由上海回去的隣居的人們，探聽出上海的繁華的生活。那時，她對於上海的印象，簡直等於天堂，隨處都有黄金，只要能到了上海，一切的生活問題都可以解决。他自己想，這些並不是她的幻想，當她看見大她幾歳的長發姆的女兒阿巧姊每次從上海回歸家鄉的時候，身上總是穿得怪漂亮的，同時，還帶着許多從不曾看見過的新奇的食物。這更是她的天堂的上海的理想的有力的證明。</p>
<p>因爲今年的鄉間的奇重的旱災，秋收已告絶望了。於是，林美英和她的年邁的母親，抱着一顆希望的心，離開破産的農村逃荒到上海來，預備來上海給人家帮傭，或到工廠裏去做女工。</p>
<p>可是，事情却出了林美英的意料之外，當她們到上海之後，一直至現在，老是找不到工作，而年邁的母親又病倒了。她終於爲了生活，不得不裝着笑臉，向獰惡的男性出賣她的肉體和靈魂。</p>
<p>當法官發出沉重的語氣宣佈拘役的日期的時候，林美英的眼前頓時地蒙着一層黑霧，她彷彿看見躺在病榻上呻吟着的年邁的母親，於是她呱的一聲哭起來，身子無力地蹲在地上。她真不明白什麽呌做有傷「風化，」但她所知道的却是「生活。」</p>

<h3>父親不許我讀書</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>的確，我總是深信自己，在現在新</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>潮流溶化了的上海，女子是有受相當教育的可能性的。但，事實竟全完相反，非但這樣，並且還有人説：女子要受什麽教育呢？她們大了可依賴丈夫過活的；受了教育有什麽用處呢？受一些當然也好，但是，對於事勢是絶對没有什麽關係的。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：有一個已有了七八個孩子的父親，他的年歳並不大，今年大的四十左右，他自己説他是一個迎合新潮流的人物。他有一個十七，八歳的女兒，還未曾受過學校教育，但是，因爲她好學努力自修的緣故，所以現在已得到了相當的學識，她的大哥，因爲要使她將來不受人欺，及受各種痛苦的緣故，所以懇求她的父親能給她受些教育，經過地數次舌戰，爭論，奮鬥的結果，目的雖已達到了，不過還只答應讀下午課。（從下午一時至四時）但是她本人很用心每天在家事完畢以後，總要讀寫到午夜十一時左右才睡；他的哥哥也隨時在指點她，那不是很好的嗎？但是她的父親因爲不願使她求學的緣故，時時破壞她，…………他常常對她的哥哥説：「你不要總是希望你妹，讀書，你要知道，女子是不能靠讀書吃飯的啊！她（妹妹）大了可以依賴丈夫的。並且有吃有用，要讀書何用呢？所以我决定明年不給她讀下去了。」先生，請你想想這些話是多末的氣人啊！他太看低女子了！難道女子一定要去做依賴丈夫的寄生蟲了，但，我知道，一個女子在這樣萬惡的社會裏，没有受相當的教育是何等地痛苦和危險啊！在這層出不窮變化無邊的無惡不作的上海，我以爲女子是應當受些相當的教育的，要實行自立的，不必去依賴男子的。我在報上天天可以閲到許多離婚的消息，假使這些女子是受過教育的，那末就可以實行自立了，不必憂慮什麽。但假使那女子是没有受過教育的，那末在這樣的時候，而想到將來生活的維艱，是如何的痛苦和可怕啊！唉！這些未受教育的弱者，不是就要因爲生活痛苦而發生種種不幸的事情嗎？所以爲謀社會幸福計，爲女子個人幸福計，我特在這裏替她們呼寃，並希望天下的爲父母者，能够覺悟得這一點，使得她們都有求學的機會，那真是社會的大幸了。末了，假使先生能够用你聰明的眼光和惱力來給我一點圓滿的答覆，那就感謝不盡了。敬祝</p>
<p>撰安　　石英洪上</p>
<p>編者按：讀了石女士的來信，我們對於她表示無限的同情與希望，我們並知道還有許多父親思想頑固的程度比石女士父親更利害的。這不僅是個人求學的問題，而是整個婦女解放運動中一個最重要的問題。——婦女教育——所以石女士在要求家庭以外，應當抱着百折不撓的精神向前去奮鬬，千萬不可因爲父親思想頑固，一切都感覺失望了。如有一分力量，還得盡力做去，個個婦女要能這樣，婦女解放的前途有希望呀！至於家庭方面，你可以託哥哥或是你父親信任的親友內父親婉轉勸説，肯肉情深，我想或許有成功的可能。如果勸説無效，那你也不必懊惱。努力自修的方法還是很多，你也可以參加申報流通圖書館讀書指導部，請他們帮助。</p>

<h3>劉得勝在江西（三）</h3>
<p>— 萬國安</p>
<p>（二）白軍同志</p>
<p>黑大個咬着牙，瞪着眼睛，用力挺着腰扳，跟着那三個傢伙又爬了幾個山頭，進入了一個破碎的村莊裏，村子裏面來來往往的人很多，有許多穿着破爛軍服的傢伙在忙亂着。</p>
<p>娘們都是剪了髮，半大的小脚都解放了，臉上都露着一股説不出的笑勁！還有手裏拿着小紅旗的，三個一堆五個一夥的在嚷嚷着，黑大個彷彿到一個另外的國度裏，什麽都瞧着有些怪模怪樣的！</p>
<p>男的女的都攪在一起説笑，上了年紀的老太太也是慌慌張張的忙亂着，一羣穿着破爛軍服的傢伙，圍着十幾個面目淸秀的年輕娘們，在拉拉扯扯的調笑着。</p>
<p>黑大個忘了兩條旗桿腿發酸，一對大眼睛一個勁的東瞧西望，走到村子當中時，忽然迎面跑過來四五個娘們，打份的都很俏皮，身上穿着藍布半大的褂子，肩頭上還披着青布披巾，一窩蜂似的就把黑大個圍上了。</p>
<p>「歡迎新來的白軍同志，……」</p>
<p>「這個黑大個身板真好！」</p>
<p>「行握手禮吧！」</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Flies to Taiyuan</h3>
<p>Yan Welcomes Him at the Airport and Holds a Banquet</p>
<p>All Circles Hold a Welcome Meeting and Request Chiang to Give Instructions</p>
<p>Yesterday He Went to the Riverbank to Visit Yan's Father</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by his wife, Madam Soong Mei-ling, Endona, Fu Zuoyi, Wang Jingguo, and others, arrived at Taiyuan at 1:40 PM on the 8th, after flying from Suiyuan on the Rong克斯 and Kangte aircraft at 11:00 AM. The planes circled in the air for a week before landing at the airport outside the North Gate. Yan Xishan, Kong Xiangxi, Xu Yongchang, Zhao Daiwen, and other important figures rushed to welcome them at the aircraft. After Chiang emerged from the plane, he shook hands with Yan in greeting and exchanged pleasantries. More than ten thousand people from all walks of life who came to the airport to welcome him shouted slogans welcoming Chairman Chiang's arrival in Taiyuan. Chiang circled the airport for a while and then rode into the city with Kong and Yan in a car, proceeding directly to the official residence set up at the Tiandi Temple to rest. At 3:00 PM, Yan hosted a banquet at the Suiyuan Governor's Office to welcome Chiang and his wife, and invited Kong and others to accompany them. A welcome rally for all circles is scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 9th at the Zisheng Hall of the Suiyuan Governor's Office, requesting Chiang to give instructions. Chiang is scheduled to inspect Taiyuan City on the afternoon of the 9th and meet with important military and political figures. All circles are also scheduled to hold a civic assembly on the morning of the 10th to welcome Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Yang Yongtai and Song Zheyuan arrived in Taiyuan from Datong by car and are expected to arrive tonight. The Ford plane also flew from Suiyuan to Taiyuan on the afternoon of the 8th. The entire city is enthusiastically welcoming Chiang, creating an unprecedented grand occasion (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th).</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] On the morning of the 9th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan went to Hebian Village, passing through Xin County and Dingxiang County, where the masses enthusiastically welcomed them. Accompanying them were Xuan Tiewu and more than ten others. Xu Yongchang and Yang Aiyuan did not go. When they arrived at Hebian, Yan's father and his wife greeted them at the gate. They had lunch and took pictures at the Yan residence to commemorate the occasion. In the afternoon, they returned to Taiyuan, and Yan returned to the official residence to express his gratitude (Central News Agency dispatch on the 9th).</p>
<p>Guihua: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by Soong Mei-ling, Fu Zuoyi, and Wang Jingguo, left Suiyuan for Taiyuan on the Euro-Asia Rong克斯 plane at noon on the 8th. His entourage, including Shi Jinxi, followed on a Ford plane. Before Chiang left, he promised to allocate 50,000 yuan to start a livestock school, and thereafter, the central government would allocate 20,000 yuan annually for recurring expenses, as well as rewarding the military and police with 1,000 yuan and the constables with 500 yuan. The weather was sunny that day, and the entire city was decorated with flags to welcome him. From the railway station to the airport outside the East Gate of the New City, the roadsides and the airport were heavily guarded. Students, soldiers, and police lined the perimeter of the airport. Prince Yun, Prince De, Xiao Zhenying, Shen Chang, Bao Yueqing, and leaders of various organizations and groups all came to see him off, totaling no less than several thousand people. At 12:20 PM, Chiang and Soong arrived at the airport from the railway station. Chiang was wearing a blue youth silk purple lambskin robe and a black呢斗篷 over it. After getting out of the car, he was guided by Fu and Wang, walked around for a week, first said goodbye to Prince Yun and Prince De, then expressed his gratitude to the welcoming people from all walks of life, and finally inspected the soldiers and police before bidding farewell and boarding the plane. Soon after, the two planes took off amidst the melodious military music and the booming of salutes. Chiang waved his white handkerchief from the plane window to frequently wave to those who were seeing him off. After a while, the dust rose, and the fuselage creaked to the end of the sky (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th).</p>

Now that Chiang has flown from Baotou to Taiyuan, the team, led by Captain Wang Jinkui, with more than twenty soldiers, and all locomotives, passed through Ping tonight and entered the Pinghan Railway heading southward (Special dispatch on the 9th).</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Yan Xishan visited Chiang at the official residence at 7:00 AM this morning, had breakfast together, and then went to Hebian to visit Yan's father, accompanied by Zhangjia Buddha and Yang Aiyuan, among others. Li Runfa, the commander of the military police, and Cheng Shurong, the director of the Public Security Bureau, accompanied them to take care of them. They arrived at Hebian at 11:00 AM, and Yan's father personally came out to greet them.

The roads were closed to pedestrians along the way, and security was very tight.

<h3>Princes Yun and De Return to Their Temples</h3>
<p>Optimistic About the Future of North China</p>
<p>Planning to Visit the Panchen Lama Soon</p>
<p>Guihua: Prince Yun and Prince De left Suiyuan for their temples on the 9th, accompanied by more than 20 staff members and guards, in eight cars.

<p>Guihua: Prince Yun and Prince De received reporters at the office of the Chief Administrator of the Tumed Banner at 9:00 AM on the 8th. Prince De reported that his visit was solely to welcome Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and that he had no other mission. He met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek yesterday morning for one and a half hours. Chiang expressed his appreciation for their handling of Mongolian affairs and promised to do his best to support and develop the construction of Mongolia, and sent Xiao Zhenying to escort them back to their temples. He plans to visit the Panchen Lama in the Otog Banner soon and inspect the banners of the Yikezhao League. The current situation in North China is critical, but after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's inspection, he believes that national defense will definitely have a solution, and he is optimistic about the future. He and Fu Zuoyi and Song Zheyuan are all good friends, and they are determined to unite and resist foreign aggression together (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th).</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Inner Mongolia fellow villagers in Peiping received a telegram from the Mongolian government, saying: We have received your telegram in full. Prince Yun and Prince De visited Chiang several times during his visit to Suiyuan. Chiang inquired in detail about the current situation in Mongolia and the work of the Mongolian government. The two princes reported truthfully and received high praise from Chiang. The colleagues were extremely grateful for Chiang's great virtue in caring about the border situation. All Mongolian people plan to express their gratitude to Chiang in the near future (Special dispatch on the 9th).</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Resolves to Reorganize Hebei Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Continues as Chairman of the Province</p>
<p>Zhang Ting'e Appointed Mayor of Tianjin</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan held an extraordinary meeting at 8:00 AM on the 9th. Wang Zhaoming, He Yingqin, Huang Shaoxiong, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Chen Shuren, Shi Qingyang, Liu Ruiheng, Zhao Pilian, Zou Lin, Tang Youren, Cao Haosen, Chen Xunyong, Zeng Zhongming, Xu Mo, Gan Naiguang, Fu Rulin, Shi Ying, Chu Minyi, Peng Xuepei, and more than 20 others attended. Chairman Wang presided over the meeting. The following important cases were resolved:</p>
<p>(1) Resolved: Reorganize the Hebei Provincial Government. The committee members and chairman, Yu Xuezhong; the committee member and director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Wei Jian; the committee member and director of the Department of Finance, Lu Muting; the committee member and director of the Department of Education, Zhou Binglin; the committee member and director of the Department of Construction, Lin Chengxi; and the committee member and director of the Department of Industry, Shi Jinghuan, should be relieved of their respective concurrent and original positions. Committee members Zhang Lisheng, Hu Yuanhui, and Zhou Zhiyi should be relieved of their original positions. Yu Xuezhong, Wei Jian, Zhang Houwan, Zheng Daoru, Zhang Lisheng, Lu Muting, Zhang Yinwu, and Hu Yuanhui were appointed as members of the Hebei Provincial Government, with Yu Xuezhong concurrently serving as chairman, Zhang Houwan concurrently serving as director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Lu Muting concurrently serving as director of the Department of Finance, Zheng Daoru concurrently serving as director of the Department of Education, and Zhang Lisheng concurrently serving as director of the Department of Construction.</p>
<p>(2) Resolved: The Mayor of Tianjin, Wang Tao, is assigned to another post and should be relieved of his original position. Zhang Ting'e is appointed as the Mayor of Tianjin.</p>
<p>(3) Resolved: The Department of Industry of the Hebei Provincial Government should be abolished immediately, and all affairs of the Department of Industry should be merged into the Department of Construction (Central News Agency dispatch on the 9th).</p>
<p>[Tianjin] None of the newly announced Hebei provincial committee members reside in Tianjin. Zhang Houwan, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Zhang Lisheng, the director of the Department of Construction, and Zhang Yinwu, a member of the provincial committee, are all in Peiping. Zheng Daoru, the director of the Department of Education, is in Nanjing. After the official order is promulgated, telegrams will be sent to urge them to take office, and it is expected that they will all arrive next week. The Hebei Provincial government discusses that the official order for the reorganization of the provincial government has not yet been received, and the affairs of the Industry Department are very simple. Currently, only our province still has this department. This reorganization will still be merged into the Department of Construction. However, the new appointees must handle affairs in the Department of Construction. Although the Industry Department is abolished and all affairs are concluded, it will still take a considerable amount of time. The decision has been made to implement joint office operations in the provincial government. I went to Wuhan a month ago to visit the Hubei Provincial Government. Compared to that government, there are fewer people and more affairs. Hebei has more land and population than Hubei. If we follow the Hubei model, there will be many difficulties in practice. Therefore, we plan to study in detail and refer to the implementation of other provinces to draft measures, and if necessary, send people out to conduct an inspection to ensure that there are no obstacles after implementation. This matter will be planned with full effort within the two months before the end of the year, at the latest by January of next year, and will be carried out simultaneously with the abolition of bureaus and the establishment of sections in various counties of the province (Special dispatch on the 9th).</p>
<p>[Tianjin] After the central government announced the reorganization of the Hebei Provincial Government and the upgrading of the municipal government to a special municipality, various circles here are quite excited. The newly appointed Mayor of Tianjin, Zhang Ting'e, went to Peiping at 3:50 PM this afternoon to visit Huang Fu and will take office within the next week. The former mayor, Wang Tao, has not come to the office to work today and has entrusted the counselor Zhang Rui to be responsible for handling the handover. The expansion of the Tianjin Municipal Government and the restoration of the previous system, its detailed plan will be drafted and approved by the central government after Zhang Ting'e takes office, and then promulgated. The new Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal Government is internally designated as Wang Yuke, the former Director of Civil Affairs of Hebei, who is currently in Hubei and has not yet returned (Special dispatch on the 9th).</p>
<h3>New Italian Ambassador to China</h3>
<p>The Ambassador to Turkey, Vincenzo, Appointed</p>
<p>Rome: The official announcement today is that Vincenzo, the current ambassador to Turkey, has been appointed as the first Italian ambassador to China. The foreign ministry's instructions were issued last night, but the date of the new ambassador's arrival has not yet been decided (National Telegram on the 9th).</p>
<h3>Shi's Reply on the Case of Trafficking Chinese Laborers</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to diplomatic sources, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has inquired about the case of trafficking in Chinese laborers discovered in the United States. Ambassador Shi Zhaoji replied by telegram, stating that before receiving instructions from the Ministry, he had already negotiated with the US Department of Labor and Agriculture in the name of the ambassador. According to the person in charge of the department, they are currently investigating the background of the 17 people who have not been caught and will repatriate them after obtaining the results, and will also inform our embassy accordingly. How to negotiate in the future will be decided after Shi obtains a report from the US Department of Labor (Special dispatch on the 9th).</p>
<h3>Procedures for Exchanging Deeds for the Recovered British Concessions in Hankou and Jiujiang Completed</h3>
<p>[Hankou] The Hankou Special Third District Municipal Bureau received a notification from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that the procedures for exchanging deeds regarding the British concessions in Hankou and Jiujiang after their recovery have now been completed. On October 27th of this year, notes were exchanged with Cadogan, declaring that the Sino-British lease agreements of March 1861 and August 1898 for the former British concessions in Hankou and Jiujiang have been formally abolished (Special dispatch on the 9th).</p>

<h3>The Inside Story and Prospects of the Change of the French Cabinet</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>The Doumergue cabinet in France has been in office for nine months. Its domestic and foreign policies have been remarkable. Now it is carrying out its plan to reform the constitution, in order to achieve its ambition to consolidate administrative power. Unexpectedly, its great ambition has not been fulfilled, and due to the opposition of the Radical Socialist Party, it has to resign. All efforts were close to success, but fell short. What a pity.</p>
<p>The reason for Doumergue's resignation, viewed on the surface, lies in Doumergue's request for the parliament to vote on the government expenditure for the first three months of next year. However, upon closer examination, it is known that the core is not here. The constitutional amendment issue may also not be the real reason for Doumergue's cabinet's resignation. In our view, this political turmoil is still the aftermath of the Stavisky affair. At the beginning of his tenure, Doumergue declared that he would thoroughly investigate the truth of this case and the responsibility for the conflict between the military police and the people on February 6. However, these two major incidents involved the Radical Socialist Party both directly and indirectly. Since this party occupies a large majority in the parliament, the inspection committee organized by the parliament must be manipulated by it in many ways. Therefore, since September, the latter case has been concluded with the phrase "misunderstanding on both sides." In fact, the dispatch of the military police and the preparation of live ammunition were all orders from Daladier. However, because Daladier is a member of the Radical Socialist Party, it had to be concluded vaguely. Nominally, the so-called Radical Socialist Party must be a very radical left-wing party. How can it imitate the behavior of bourgeois parties and only value profit and status? In fact, the Radical Socialist Party in France is neither radical nor has much relationship with the Socialist Party. In essence, it is a middle-class party. The name and reality are not consistent. Because of this, it is quite involved in the Stavisky affair. For example, Daladier, who was the Minister of Public Works during the Herriot cabinet and the Minister of Colonies during the Chautemps cabinet, advised businessmen to invest in the businesses operated by Stavisky. Lanotte, who was the Minister of Justice during the Chautemps cabinet, even jointly operated businesses with Stavisky's associates. Chautemps's close relative, Basset, served as the Chief Prosecutor and tried to cover up Stavisky's fraud up to nineteen times. According to French right-wing newspapers, Bourse, the chairman of the Republican Industry and Commerce Committee of the Radical Party, even received a bribe of 2 million francs from Stavisky. In addition, there were countless judges and lawyers who were killed or committed suicide. According to a police accusation, there are about 1,000 pieces of evidence of Stavisky's bribery. However, once these material evidence were handed over to the parliamentary inspection committee, they all disappeared invisibly. Therefore, since September, the truth of the Stavisky case has never been clarified. The scope of this case is imaginable. Stavisky himself owed more than 560 million francs in bad checks. And the issuance of these bonds was aided by high-ranking officials. Once the truth is exposed, not only the main players in the fraud case will be at risk of legal sanctions, but also the reputation of the Radical Socialist Party will be greatly affected. In order to protect itself, the Radical Socialist Party must maintain its majority in the current parliament, so as to have ample time to destroy the material evidence related to the Stavisky case. Therefore, in the near future, it will definitely try to prevent the expansion of the cabinet's power and oppose the dissolution of the parliament, fearing that the material evidence of the Stavisky case will still be there after the dissolution, and it will be difficult to ensure that the truth will not come out. Therefore, the focus of the struggle between Doumergue and the Radical Party this time is entirely on this. What Doumergue wants is to dissolve the existing parliament, and what the Radical Party seeks is to preserve the current parliament. Since the dispute between the two sides lies here, it is difficult to seek their continued cooperation. After Doumergue's intention to request government expenditure for next spring was revealed, the Radical Party realized that Doumergue was determined to dissolve the current parliament at any time, and therefore used preemptive means to overthrow Doumergue. This is why Doumergue's cabinet had to resign.</p>
<p>Now, the new Flandin cabinet has been formed, and it seems that there will be no problems for a while. However, Flandin belongs to the Republican Left, occupying only 29 seats in the lower house and only 13 seats in the upper house, with very little power. In the future, every move he makes must be at the command of the Radical Party. Otherwise, his cabinet will be difficult to stabilize. However, the truth of the Stavisky affair is unclear, and the people cannot but doubt the current party leaders. And there is no prospect of re-election in the short term of this parliament. Whether the public will not be disappointed by doubt and turmoil will not occur due to disappointment, affecting the political situation, is still unknown.</p>
<h3>Japanese Organize Long-Distance Bus Company in Yushu</h3>

<h3>Conflict Between Implementation Rules of the International Postal Convention and Criminal Law</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Directorate General of Posts submitted a report to the Ministry stating that Article 153A of the implementation rules of the Cairo International Postal Convention seems to conflict with our country's laws and requested instructions on how to respond.

<h3>Success or Failure of the Naval Conference Hinges on Japan's Attitude</h3>
<p>The Japanese Government Is Considering the British Proposal</p>
<p>Davis Quietly Working Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>[London] The Japanese delegation hosted a banquet for the American delegation this afternoon. Apart from this, there has been no movement in the naval talks, as they are awaiting the Japanese government's response to the British compromise proposal. It is widely believed that there is little hope that the Japanese government will accept the proposal. However, it is hoped that the proposal may serve as a starting point for negotiation. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Foreign Ministry received an official report last night from Ambassador Matsudaira in London, reporting that the United Kingdom had submitted a compromise proposal to the American and Japanese delegations, recognizing Japan's demand for naval equality under certain conditions. Foreign Minister Hirota reported to the cabinet this morning on the progress of the London Naval Talks. At the same time, British Ambassador Sir Clive Wigram met with Vice Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru at the Foreign Ministry to express his gratitude for the sincere hospitality shown by the government and people to Admiral Sir Frederick Dreyer, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in Japan, and exchanged information on the naval talks and discussed other issues with Shigemitsu. Foreign Ministry officials are currently studying the British proposal and will then hold a joint meeting with the Navy Ministry to discuss it. A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated today that Japan deeply appreciates the United Kingdom's efforts to seek a compromise, but the British proposal is still far from Japan's original proposal. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] Today, official circles here, after receiving news that the British efforts at mediation had failed, still expressed hope that the bilateral naval talks in London could be salvaged. Deputy Secretary of State Phillips stated today that U.S. representative Norman Davis is quietly working tirelessly behind the scenes. This statement has led to speculation that the American delegation has an undisclosed plan to prevent the talks from failing completely. At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from London, the United Kingdom is planning to avoid the complex issues arising from the dispute over naval equality, which is currently under consideration by the Japanese representatives. It is reported that the main points of the British plan are to give Japan more submarines, the United States more aircraft carriers, and the United Kingdom more cruisers. However, the figures specified in this new plan are considered unsatisfactory by the Japanese side. It is reported that the aim of the British new plan is to abandon the issues of equality and ratio, as navies with different content cannot be equal. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The British Compromise Proposal Makes Many Concessions to Japan</h3>
<p>Based Solely on National Defense Needs</p>
<p>Recognizing Japan's Increased Naval Ratio</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the compromise proposal presented by the British side during the Anglo-Japanese talks on the 7th, reliable sources indicate that the proposal contains a clause regarding naval ratios that includes a very important concession to Japan from the British. It recognizes Japan's increased naval ratio. Although the principle of total tonnage demanded by Japan is implicitly rejected, a system of classifying by warship type and special tonnage will be added, allowing each related naval power to declare a maximum warship construction plan to replace it. In addition, regarding the meaning of offensive weapons and defensive weapons, it accommodates part of Japan's claim, recognizing the expansion of submarines and other weapons that Japan calls defensive. However, both Japan and the United States are taking a lukewarm attitude towards this compromise proposal, and the result will likely be that it remains shelved. The British delegation is strongly defending the talks on the 7th and has not submitted a special proposal to Japan. (8th Rengo Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The Labor Party's organ newspaper, the Daily Herald, reported that the British government has put forward two suggestions for the initial naval talks. (Already seen in the previous telegram) The purpose of these suggestions is to break the deadlock in the naval talks, but they cannot be formally regarded as a mediation proposal by the United Kingdom. Well-informed sources said that the main points of the two suggestions are to find a way to ensure that future naval treaties do not establish any hierarchy between the navies of various countries, so that the naval policy of each country can be based solely on the country's national defense needs. The countries participating in the Naval Treaty would agree to a "gentleman's agreement" to notify each other of their warship construction plans and any modifications. The restriction according to warship type as stipulated in the Washington Treaty, i.e., the qualitative restriction, may be maintained, but the various different warship types within each warship type will be reallocated. As for the political clauses, they will be negotiated separately. Within the Japanese delegation, opinions on the new proposal differ depending on political or technical viewpoints. The cautious attitude of the American representatives is generally believed to be due to the fear of rejection by Tokyo, and they intend to express their views after Japan responds. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The outline of the plan tentatively proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald at the Anglo-Japanese talks on the 7th is roughly as follows: (1) Respect national prestige, propose that equality in armaments and warship construction plans should be discussed in advance with the related countries. In other words, for the aspect of restricting the amount held, or the self-generated amount, change it. That is to say, respect the national prestige, and although Japan’s claim of substantial equality is not intended to be recognized immediately, in order to satisfy the abstract principle of equality in armaments, although each country can restrict its necessary military force, it is not necessary for each country to fully achieve its maximum warship construction, and the related countries should negotiate on the substantial amount held and exercise a fair and just agreement. As a result of the above, although each country has no legal obligations, they should be made to bear moral obligations, etc. (9th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Believing American and Japanese Desires Unsatisfied</h3>
<p>Fearing Rejection and Responsibility for Rupture</p>
<p>Actively Preparing Procedures for Treaty Abolition</p>
<p>[London] In the compromise proposal presented by British Prime Minister MacDonald, there is an item on "qualitative and quantitative adjustments," a portion of which, even if admitting an increase in submarine tonnage, still reduces other types of warships. The overall difference from existing ratios is not significant. It is said this is intended to cater to the United States and Japan. Regarding this point, the Japanese delegation plans to resolutely point out the defects of this proposal in the next Anglo-Japanese consultation and demand reconsideration. (9th, Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The Japanese delegation is studying the British proposal. Its content merely maintains nominal equality and substantially changes the current ratio to a great extent. This still does not conform to Japan's fundamental policy. The Japanese delegation, fearing that rejecting this proposal would result in no opportunity to continue negotiations, has decided on a policy to make Britain better understand Japan's claims in order to realize Japan's demands. (9th, Nihon Rengo Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese government is determined to quickly complete the procedures for abandoning the Washington Treaty and clarify the Empire's resolve. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 8th, a crucial instruction telegram was sent to the two representatives in London, Matsudaira and Yamamoto. Foreign Minister Hirota, accommodating the opinion of Naval Minister Osumi, stated that since the procedures concerning command matters have already been completed today, it is imperative to announce the abandonment notice without delay. Consequently, Foreign Minister Hirota, along with Prime Minister Okada and the ministers Osumi and Hayashi, consulted and then instructed that Britain and the United States be urged again to jointly abandon the treaty, and that Italy and France also be urged to do so. The current government will await the arrival of a formal telegram from Matsudaira and Yamamoto regarding the completion of the persuasion negotiations, after which a cabinet meeting will be held to initiate procedures for consulting the Privy Council. Naval Minister Osumi insists that this take place before the extraordinary Diet session. Ministers Okada, Hayashi, and Hirota also agree with this view. Therefore, the cabinet meeting around the 20th will decide on the proposal to consult the Privy Council, and all domestic procedures for abandoning the treaty should be completed around the 25th. (9th, Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Asahi Shimbun commented on Britain's compromise measure, saying that Japan's demand for equality is natural and reasonable and should not be subject to any discussion. The United States has rejected it, which is truly incomprehensible. If naval talks break down as a result, the United States must bear the responsibility. (9th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Matsudaira Sends Letter to British Newspaper, Urging Candid Exchange Between US and Japan</h3>
<p>Reports from Tokyo Denounced as Absurd</p>
<p>[London] British newspapers recently excerpted an article published in the Japanese "Nichinichi Shimbun," which stated that Japanese Rear Admiral Yamamoto and U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Standley had engaged in intense debate over the naval strength of Japan and the United States. Consequently, Ambassador Matsudaira published an open letter in "The Morning Post," strongly refuting such reports. It stated, in brief, "The actual situation of the naval talks, in any respect, is vastly different from what is reported in the newspapers. The representatives of both the U.S. and Japan, in reality, adopted an extremely sincere and harmonious attitude. It is not difficult to understand that this talk was marked by candor and a complete absence of barriers. The news reports stating that the feelings of the representatives of Japan and the United States were quite 'agitated' during the talks are entirely unfounded and should never have been disclosed in the press. It is deeply regrettable, and I sincerely hope that future events will prove their falsity." (8th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Inquiring about Naval Conference News</h3>

German sources here also say that Ribbentrop's arrival is not unrelated to the naval conference negotiations. Ribbentrop plans to stay for several more days before heading to northern England.

<h3>British House of Commons Debates Arms Trade Issue</h3>
<p>Labour Party Moves to Prohibit Private Manufacture of Weapons</p>
<p>Nationalization as a Model for the World</p>
<p>Ultimately Defeated by a Large Majority</p>
<p>Liberal Party Demands Judicial Investigation</p>
<p>[London] Labour MP Attlee, when introducing a motion in the House of Commons today to prohibit the private manufacture of arms, said that highly respected naval figures and citizens are also engaged in the trade of murder and arson. The Labour Party's motion sparked a lengthy debate and was ultimately defeated by a vote of 279 to 68.</p>
<p>The Labour Party's motion stated, "This House endorses the opposition expressed in the League of Nations Covenant to the private manufacture of arms. This House laments that international agreements have not yet addressed this universally recognized harm. This House believes that Britain should immediately prohibit the private manufacture and operation of arms by its citizens and endeavor to have the state manufacture such armaments and ammunition as may be deemed necessary, as a model."</p>
<p>The Labour Party believes that arms companies are corrupting forces in governments around the world. Attlee claimed that many naval and army figures are employees of arms companies, not only because they have commercial talent, but because they have deeply entrenched interests in the arms trade. Therefore, even if there are wiser politicians, their efforts to create world peace cannot succeed. He believes that nationalizing arms manufacturing is the right path. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that the British government welcomes this debate and that, on this issue, Britain is less blameworthy than any other country in the world. The government is convinced that the most effective and feasible way to handle this matter is not through national legislation, but through management in accordance with the international treaties negotiated in Geneva. Britain's management of arms exports is very strict; exports are not permitted without a license, and licenses are not issued for arms exports destined for foreign governments. Britain has never allowed its overseas diplomats or consular representatives to be lobbyists or solicitors for arms companies. Only when foreign countries state their intention to purchase arms will the diplomatic side provide assistance and strive to provide appropriate opportunities for British businesses. Britain does not grant preferential export loans for the arms trade. Britain is the only country in the world that does this. Britain never subsidizes private arms manufacturing plants, and Britain's management methods are stricter than those of any other country. This problem cannot be addressed simply by prohibiting private manufacturing. The British government does not believe that the remedy lies in state monopolies. It believes that the best method is an international agreement, so that all countries that manufacture and export arms have strict restrictions and management. This is what the British government is currently striving for. As for the events published by the U.S. Senate's arms trade investigation committee, it does not wish to comment lightly on a friendly country's investigation, but feels that the methods used to reach conclusions are not those that Britain could adopt. To give an example, one of the telegrams that the U.S. Senate considered as evidence was sent by an unsuccessful manager of an American arms factory in Poland, who claimed that he failed to obtain a Polish order because King George of England intervened, summoning the Polish ambassador and informing him of the importance of Poland purchasing British arms. This kind of rumor is extremely outlandish. It must be understood that the King of England is not a high-ranking figure in the British government, as described in the U.S. Senate's investigation records, but is the head of state and cannot be involved in any way with the sale of arms.</p>
<p>Lord Privy Seal Baldwin stated that the Labour Party's motive is simply to establish the principle of nationalizing industries. He has heard people say that profiting from selling arms is immoral, but making wages from manufacturing arms is not immoral. He believes that government monopoly of arms manufacturing would inevitably lead to a large increase in global armaments. In 1925, the British government approved a convention to ban international arms trade, but it became a dead letter because many other countries did not approve it. But we will now go to Geneva again and do our utmost to ensure that all countries approve it. (8th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] After the House of Commons overwhelmingly defeated the Labour Party's motion to prohibit the private manufacture of arms, it demanded a judicial investigation into the entire arms trade issue. (8th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Prevention of Incitement Act Fierce Debate in the House of Lords</h3>
<p>Opposition Amendment Defeated</p>
<p>[London] The British House of Lords adjourned at 4:12 AM today, after a meeting lasting twelve hours. This was the longest meeting since the debate on the Home Rule Bill of 1887. The opposition parties introduced 24 amendments to the government's Prevention of Incitement Act, which were all defeated after fierce debate between 60 government party members and 10 Labour Party members. (9th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] During the debate on the Prevention of Incitement Act in the House of Lords today, Socialist MP Sir Allen announced a shocking event, claiming that he personally learned months ago that an organization was plotting to seize the British Broadcasting Corporation and stage a coup, planning to seize power by unconstitutional means. As for whether this organization is left-leaning or right-leaning, Sir Allen declined to disclose it. (9th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Office and Trade Department Consider Responding to Japan's New Petroleum Law</h3>
<p>Japan's Response Sent to Oil Companies</p>
<p>[London] The British Foreign Office is now, together with the Trade Department, considering the steps that Britain should take to deal with Japan's new Petroleum Law in the future. The British government has sent Japan's reply to the various British oil companies. If Japan's Petroleum Law is not changed, British businesses will suffer significant losses. Japan's reply was delivered to Britain several days ago and has not yet been published, but it is known that its attitude is considered unsatisfactory by Britain. The United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands are currently engaged in discussions through their diplomats stationed in Japan. According to Japan's new Petroleum Law, the Japanese government has the right to set the price of oil, and foreign oil companies must store oil in Japan. Japanese authorities may freely use it in emergencies. (9th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Lytton Advises Britons Not to Act Alone</h3>
<p>Regarding the Puppet State Issue, the League of Nations Resolution Should Be Upheld</p>
<p>[London] In light of changes in British public opinion, Lord Lytton, chairman of the League of Nations Manchuria Inquiry Commission, published an open letter in The Times, strongly opposing it. He stated, in brief, "The League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly passed a resolution on February 24, 1933, deciding not to recognize 'Manchukuo.' Britain is one of the countries that voted in favor, so how can it act alone without seeking the opinions of other League of Nations member states?" (9th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons today questioned the Treasury, asking whether it could guarantee to Parliament that it would not approve any loans to Japan or "Manchukuo" "because Japan refuses to fulfill its obligations to the League of Nations." Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain replied that he would not give Parliament such a specific guarantee. Chamberlain said that such a specific guarantee would be very difficult to provide and that each loan must be considered individually. The questioner was Labour MP Wellmuth.

<h3>Japanese Securities Plummet</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese securities have been depressed due to the turmoil over the reform of the Manchurian agency, the difficulty of budget compilation, and the impending implementation of an extraordinary profit tax. Recently, prices have plummeted. The market is now devoid of buyers, with only sellers rampant.</p>
<p>On the 8th, the chairman and four representatives of the Tokyo Stock Exchange visited the president of the Bank of Japan, Hijikata, and the president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Yūkō, to explain the situation of the securities crash and plead for a loan of 60 million yen. The two presidents replied that they would consider the matter. The representatives then visited Finance Minister Fujii, reported on their visit to the presidents of the Bank of Japan and the Industrial Bank of Japan, and inquired whether the government's planned temporary profit tax was estimated to be excessive, and whether the government's intention was actually to collect around 100 million yen. The Finance Minister stated that this was not the case and said that there would be no further tax increases in fiscal year 10 and that the government's purpose in raising taxes was entirely to cultivate economic strength and strengthen financial content.</p>
<p>After meeting with representatives of the Stock Exchange, Bank of Japan President Hijikata told reporters that the cause of the securities slump was not the deterioration of the real economy or the financial sector, but the psychological impact of the tax increase issue. Therefore, the Bank of Japan does not need to immediately study specific countermeasures. The Bank of Japan is easing capital for the Exchange to induce buyers to take the initiative, but if other fears arise, it will have no effect. I will temporarily observe the situation and then decide on countermeasures.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Fujii said that the Stock Exchange representatives came to inquire about the government's policy. What the financial authorities hope for is the development of the national economy and the strengthening of the financial base. This time, we are studying and implementing the temporary profit tax method with a cautious attitude. Apart from this determination, there is no intention to increase general taxes.

<h3>New German Regulations Affect U.S. Trade</h3>
<p>Car Sales Shut Down</p>
<p>[Washington] Recent new regulations implemented by Germany regarding foreign trade have virtually shut down the sales of U.S. goods, especially automobiles, in Germany. The State Department has recently ordered a rigorous investigation into this matter. The government believes that although Germany has declared the U.S.-German commercial treaty abolished, the treaty remains in effect until October 1935. Therefore, the measures taken by Germany violate the most-favored-nation clause contained in the commercial treaty, and a protest may be lodged. (8th, Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Philippine Rejection of Foreign Merchants, Overseas Chinese Status Shaken</h3>
<p>American Merchants and Retailers Affected</p>
<p>Legislative Bill Temporarily Shelved</p>
<p>[Manila] Several thousand overseas Chinese in the Philippines were able to eke out a respite because the Senate decided by a majority vote to shelve two bills restricting foreign retailers and the rice industry. The two bills had been passed by the House of Representatives in the past three days, and the Senate also expressed its approval. However, due to the backlog of bills, there was no time to submit them for discussion when the legislature adjourned. Overseas Chinese merchants, who hold an important part of the retail and rice industries in the Philippines, are deeply afraid of the passage of these two bills. The legislature will meet in 1935 and 1936, and the overseas Chinese have decided to continue their efforts to defeat the bill. The Philippine Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce has now formed a special committee to handle this matter. According to the retail industry bill, foreign merchants engaged in retail must liquidate their businesses by the end of 1936 so that Filipinos can occupy an important commercial position. Opponents say that this deadline is too short and that at least five years should be given. The House Committee also decided that after the elimination of foreign merchant power, Filipinos and Americans should be given equal opportunity. The committee published statistics stating that Chinese account for 50% of the retail industry in the Philippines, Japanese account for 20%, Filipinos account for slightly more than 20%, and other countries account for less than 10%. If foreign merchants are not excluded, Filipino merchants will have no opportunity to develop. As for the rice industry regulations, they stipulate that no one other than Filipinos or Americans, or any foreign company, may directly or indirectly buy or sell rice. However, foreign merchants are allowed to liquidate their businesses within five years. The overseas Chinese side believes that since China has continuously opened commercial ports since 1842, allowing foreigners to go there to do business, it now considers this matter in the Philippines to be unfair and is making every effort to oppose it.

<p>[Paris] The new cabinet has been formed at midnight by Flandin, leader of the Left Republican Party and former Minister of Public Works. Most of the new cabinet members are retained from the old cabinet. Laval remains as Foreign Minister. However, General Morin succeeds General Pétain as Minister of War, which is a matter of great interest. It is said that this hero of the European War, General Pétain, insisted on refusing to participate in the new cabinet. (9th, Kokumin Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] The list of the Flandin Cabinet was submitted to the President this morning at 1 AM. Like the previous cabinet, it has a mixed character.

Fourteen of them are members of the Chamber of Deputies, four are members of the Senate, and the Ministers of Aviation, War, and Pensions are not members of Parliament. Théodore Steeg declined to join the cabinet because of his relationship with Doumergue. The Radical Socialist Party has expressed unconditional support for the new cabinet. (9th, Kokumin Telegram)</p>
<p>Flandin is 45 years old, six feet four inches tall, the youngest, tallest, and most handsome Prime Minister in French history. He speaks English well and is an expert in aviation, commerce, and economics. In 1931, he toured Central Europe to study various issues. (9th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

The Left Radical Party occupies two seats. The remaining six people, Laval and Mandel, do not belong to any party. Rivollet is a representative of war veterans. (9th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Herriot and Marin are both listed as ministers without portfolio. Marin, as the leader of the right wing, is taking the place of Théodore Steeg, as a counterbalance to the appointment of Herriot, the leader of the Radical Party. Morin, who is replacing Pétain as Minister of War, is a member of the Higher Military Council. The appointment of Régnier as Minister of the Interior follows tradition, as this position must be held by the Radical Party. (9th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>The new Minister of Post, Mandel, is a member of the Chamber of Deputies who is not affiliated with any party and is the most prominent newcomer to the cabinet. He assisted Clemenceau during the European War. Although he is not well-known, he is eloquent and was an important figure on the Stavisky Affair investigation committee. The new Minister of Justice, Bérault, is a member of the right-wing party. The new Minister of Agriculture, Cazelles, and the Minister of Public Works, Roy, are both Radical Party senators. The new Minister of Labor, Jacquier, is the general rapporteur for the budget bill in the Chamber of Deputies. The only undersecretary in the new cabinet, Béraud, belongs to Flandin's Central Party. (9th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>New Prime Minister Declares Continuation of Political Truce</h3>
<p>[Paris] As soon as the new cabinet was formed, Prime Minister Flandin declared to the press, "Since I have assembled a new cabinet consisting of comrades who support the political truce, the policy of political truce must continue unabated. I am confident that the new cabinet members can set aside partisan views and devote their enthusiasm to serving France and upholding the Republic. Our sole objective is to work together and fight against disasters and unemployment, in order to seek economic recovery, maintain financial reform, and constitutional governance, in order to seek reform of national politics. Since I have endeavored to form a government in the shortest possible time, I hope that the country can support it with sympathy. We will start working immediately and will attend the Chamber of Deputies next Tuesday. The first cabinet meeting will be held at 5 PM today." (9th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] The political situation has now begun to show signs of stability. Flandin, who was ordered to form the cabinet, declared that he had abandoned the plan for a provisional budget and only wished to quickly implement constitutional reforms after the formal budget bill was passed. The Radical Socialist Party faction in the Chamber of Deputies and party leader Herriot shared the same opinion, saying that "any government that actively engages in economic recovery and safeguards the republican system" will be supported by the Radical Socialist Party faction. After the establishment of the Flandin Cabinet, the central parties in the Chamber of Deputies and the Radical Socialists on the left may provide assistance. The Republican Socialists and the New Socialists may either follow the lead of the Radical Socialists or adopt a benevolent neutral attitude. Only the orthodox Socialists and Communist deputies will continue to oppose the government. According to Chamber of Deputies sources, if Flandin does not encounter unexpected difficulties in the distribution of ministerial positions, the cabinet formation work will not encounter obstacles in the parliament.

<h3>Authorities Guard Against Riots, New Cabinet's Lifespan Difficult to Prolong</h3>
<p>[Paris] It is uncertain whether the short-term cabinet hastily formed by the new Prime Minister Flandin can last for more than a few weeks. Youth groups are now marching in the streets in groups of three or five, shouting "Long live France" and "Long live Doumergue." This afternoon, a small squad of soldiers carrying rifles, numbering fifty, patrolled the Latin Quarter. Although patriotic groups have not yet been dispatched, they are all preparing in advance in case of riots. The authorities have implemented a strict plan to maintain law and order. Police teams are stationed around the Senate and in the surrounding streets to protect it. (8th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Doumergue's Retirement, National Public Opinion Expresses Uniform Regret</h3>
<p>[Paris] After the Radical Party cabinet members resigned to the Prime Minister this morning, the Doumergue Cabinet resigned en masse. Evening newspapers commented on the matter and unanimously expressed deep regret for Prime Minister Doumergue's retirement, while also worrying about the future of the political situation. "Paris-Soir" said that it would be impossible for the organization and political activities of the new cabinet to be similar to those of the former Doumergue cabinet. "Le Figaro" believed that the current Chamber of Deputies could not accomplish anything and advocated dissolving it, re-electing it, and letting the people make the final decision. "Le Temps" said, "Prime Minister Doumergue is loyal and patriotic, does not harbor private opinions, and is rich in experience. The reason why the French people asked him to take on this arduous task is because they know that Doumergue can put national interests above partisan views. As for Herriot, he does not know how to get rid of the shackles of the party, nor can he. The difference between the two lies here. The positions that the two people retain in history will also differ because of this." "Qingyi Bao" said that the current political turmoil is unusually complex, but it must be resolved, as there will always be no shortage of people willing to be cabinet members. However, the formation of the new cabinet is only a temporary solution. (8th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Vowing to Retreat to the Countryside, Still Encouraging Future Generations with National Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Paris] Prime Minister Doumergue declared that as soon as he handed over power, he would "leave the capital quickly with a light car and simple entourage" and return to Tournefeuille in the south of France to live in seclusion. It is reported that since the completion of his presidential term in 1931, the Prime Minister has withdrawn from politics and has not heard about current affairs. In early February of this year, serious disturbances occurred in Paris, and the Daladier Cabinet was forced to resign. The political situation was critical. President Lebrun then asked Doumergue to come forward and unite the various parties to save the country from its difficulties. Deeply patriotic, he did not avoid difficulties in his twilight years and accepted the heavy responsibility. Doumergue recently issued a letter to the people, saying, "Given the situation, I cannot but resign now. I ask the people of the country to remain calm in order to resolve the current difficulties and ensure the safety of the country." (8th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>American Election Final Results Announced</h3>
<p>Democrats Hold Majority in Congress</p>
<p>Borah Advocates Thorough Reorganization of the Republican Party</p>
<p>[Washington] Reports from all states regarding Tuesday's national elections were fully received today. The Democratic Party's control of the House of Representatives has been further strengthened. Historically, in elections during a president's term, the ruling party usually suffers losses in the House, averaging 49 seats. This time, the Democratic Party has instead gained seats. Both the House and Senate now have more than two-thirds majorities. The new distribution in the current Senate is as follows:</p>
<p>Democrats: 69 seats</p>
<p>Republicans: 25 seats</p>
<p>Farmer-Labor Party: 1 seat</p>
<p>Progressive Party: 1 seat</p>
<p>Republican Senator Borah, in light of this disastrous defeat, stated in Chicago today that the Republican Party must thoroughly reorganize, or it will perish due to political cowardice. Borah urged the party to elect a more progressive new leader. He suggested Senator Vandenberg or McNary. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Republican Party, facing its greatest historical defeat, remains undaunted and plans to redouble its efforts in preparation for victory in the 1936 congressional elections. According to news from here today, the party will reorganize along more expansive lines, but will not alter its strong opposition to President Roosevelt's New Deal policies. With the election over, Americans, who ardently support President Roosevelt's New Deal policies rather than individual Democrats, are now gradually anticipating the results of their actions. Some voters are apprehensive about the possibility of inflation and the issuance of bonuses to veterans. Others are concerned that candidates who supported President Roosevelt during the campaign will become conservatives after being elected. One expert claimed that the New Deal is clearly associated with the Democrats, but since President Roosevelt recently declared his opposition to continued inflation, the issuance of bonuses to veterans may not materialize. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt will continue to pursue his moderate policies. Today, President Roosevelt summoned Representative Buchanan, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, to the White House for consultation. After the meeting, Buchanan stated that he is preparing several proposals to submit to the next Congress so that various plans can proceed quickly. Of the seven states in America that voted on the issue of alcohol prohibition, six have declared the death sentence for the ban. However, Kansas, a Republican stronghold, has decided to maintain prohibition. It is reported that the First Lady has decided to serve American light wine at White House banquets, as a sign of the complete repeal of prohibition. However, each person at White House banquets will only be allowed to drink two glasses of wine. The recent seat distribution in the House of Representatives is as follows:</p>
<p>Democrats: 320</p>
<p>Republicans: 102</p>
<p>Progressives: 7</p>
<p>Farmer-Labor: 3</p>
<p>Unknown: 3</p>
<p>The recent seat distribution in the Senate is as follows:</p>
<p>Democrats: 69</p>
<p>Republicans: 25</p>
<p>Progressive and Farmer-Labor: 1 each</p>
<p>In the states that elected governors, the Democrats hold a dominant position in 24 states. Therefore, there are a total of 38 governors affiliated with the Democratic Party. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Now that the Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, party leaders believe that the treaty previously signed with Canada to build the St. Lawrence Seaway and power plant will be passed in the next Congress. The St. Lawrence Seaway Treaty was signed in Washington in July of this year, stipulating that the St. Lawrence River be deepened to 25 or 27 feet to facilitate navigation, and that a waterway be opened to allow ocean-going vessels to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to cities on the Great Lakes. In addition, it is planned to develop hydropower with millions of dollars. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>

If the customs broker fails to compensate for the undercalculated tax amount, the customs office may temporarily suspend or revoke their business license and may also order compensation through legal means." All customs offices have been instructed to comply. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Legislative Member Wang Xiaoying's Discussion of Criminal Law</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Legislative Member Wang Xiaoying recently stated in a private capacity that all articles of the criminal law passed by the Legislative Yuan have made progress, but it is regrettable that Article 239 remains conservative and has not been corrected. In his opinion, adultery should be punished for both parties. If it is not punished, it should not be punished across the board to show equality. It is reported that the Central Political Council has now drafted amendment principles, which will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review, or the aims of the women's movement can have a considerable effect.

<h3>Bombing Case at Keelung Police Station in Taiwan</h3>
<p>Extremely Serious Incident Only Allowed to Be Publicized After More Than a Month</p>
<p>Taiwanese Youth Zheng Qingshui Tragically Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The "Keelung Bomb Incident" recently occurred in Taiwan, and the matter is extremely serious. The Governor-General's Office prohibited its publication, and it was only lifted on the 26th of last month. Zheng Qingshui, the Taiwanese youth who threw the bomb, was surrounded by Japanese detectives on the 28th and committed suicide by disembowelment, dying calmly and righteously. The following is a record of the case:</p>
<p>Bombing the Police Station: This year, the Japanese in Taiwan are vigorously promoting "Taiwan's National Defense First Line, Southern Gate Key." Officials and civilians are united to deal with the extraordinary period of 1935-36, and National Defense Associations are established in various states. Under the slogan of "Government and People United," they are luring the public to join the association. On the one hand, they are appeasing the pro-Japanese autonomy movement by rejecting petitions to establish a Taiwanese parliament, while agreeing to reform the autonomous municipal and township councilors, changing from all official appointments to half official and half elected, as a compromise. They are using the establishment of the autonomy reform plan and the union of the National Defense Associations to cover up the situation and show unity. Prince Fushimi, Navy Marshal and Minister of the Navy, and Prince Nashimoto, Army Marshal, took the opportunity of the major naval exercise to visit Taiwan one after another to encourage the so-called "National Defense First Line Movement." Unexpectedly, the day after Prince Fushimi completed his inspection and left Taiwan on September 28, two days before Prince Nashimoto arrived in Taiwan to inspect and hold the founding ceremony for the Taiwan National Defense Association Joint Headquarters (October 1), a bomb incident suddenly occurred in Keelung County (where the Taiwan military port is located) at 11:05 AM on September 29. Liu Tiandao and Zhuang Kuntu were injured, and a wall of the police station was destroyed. The whole city was in panic. The Taiwan authorities considered this incident unprecedented in Taiwan. It occurred two days before Prince Nashimoto's arrival and was regarded as extremely serious. Therefore, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office prohibited newspapers from publishing the report and kept it extremely secret. It was only lifted on October 26, allowing newspapers to publish it. Japan has always been known for its well-managed police. Taiwan is its colony, so the police and detectives are extraordinarily meticulous. After the incident, the entire Keelung police force was immediately mobilized for investigation. As a result of the investigation, the words "Zheng Yongzai" were found on one side of the cloth package left at the bomb site. Checking the household registration, it was found to be the property of Zheng Mushui, the second son of the head of household at No. 48, Jinguashi, Ruifang Township, Yilan County, Keelung. That same afternoon at 7:00 PM, Zheng Yongzai was arrested, but it was not him. Further investigation revealed that it was Zheng Yongzai's elder brother, Zheng Qingshui (21 years old), the eldest son of Zheng Mushui, who was responsible, but he had already fled. The entire county was mobilized overnight, and a cordon was set up to search the entire Keelung County. At about 11:00 PM that night, it was reported that Zheng was hiding in the house of an old woman, Lin, in the Catholic Church. Five detectives and police officers were dispatched to Lin's house to interrogate her. Lin admitted that Zheng was hiding in her house. Lin Chenshui tried to enter the house to arrest him, but Zheng Qingshui rushed out, using the Taiwanese knife he was carrying to slash Lin Chenshui in several places, reaching deep into the bone. Lin Chenshui was seriously injured and could not resist, and Zheng escaped. It was dark and rainy, and he could not be caught after pursuit. A thorough search yielded no results. The Keelung Police Department notified all parts of Taiwan to mobilize for cooperation. On September 30, October 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., reports of Zheng's hiding place were received, but all attempts to arrest him failed. As a result of mobilizing the entire Taiwanese police force for more than a month, he could not be captured. Only his sworn brothers Gao Jinxing and Xu Nanshan were captured. Two detectives were punished for this case. On the one hand, the police department offered a reward for his arrest.</p>
<p>Surrounded and Committed Suicide: Until October 28, Zheng suddenly appeared in the Maren Village, Xiajiaoxi Township, Keelung County. It was about 6:30 AM. Zheng went to the home of Liao Chaoying, the local Baozheng. Liao was not at home. Zheng asked Liao's mother to borrow 200 yuan for travel expenses. Liao happened to return from outside and saw Zheng from a distance. He immediately reported to the police station. The police station quickly telephoned the Keelung Police Department. The county magistrate dispatched the police section chief Sakai to command more than a hundred police officers in a total mobilization to rush to the scene and conduct a large-scale search. At that time, Zheng was discussing borrowing travel expenses with Liao's younger brother, Jixi, Liao's uncle, Huoshao, and Wu Murong. While talking in the bamboo garden, he saw Japanese police officers approaching from a distance. He walked into the rice field. When he entered the rice field, he saw that the surrounding Japanese police had formed a cordon. Knowing that he could not escape, he came out of the rice field. Without waiting for the Japanese police to approach, he stabbed his abdomen with the Taiwanese knife he was carrying and slashed it horizontally. His abdomen was broken, his intestines came out, and blood flowed like a torrent. He remained calm and composed, sitting upright on the edge of the field. It is estimated that since September 29 night, Zheng had been surrounded by a large group of Japanese police, slashing police officers and escaping from the encirclement. He had appeared several times in a month and had managed to escape. The Japanese police were wary of Zheng's bravery. Seeing him suddenly sitting upright on the edge of the field and not moving, they surrounded him from a distance with a hundred people. Two police officers came out from behind and struck him remotely with wooden sticks. Zheng did not move or resist. Only then did they go to seize Zheng. They discovered that Zheng had committed suicide. He was sent to Yilan Hospital. It was 9:00 AM. After arriving at the hospital, he died of excessive blood loss at 10:00 AM. He did not give any confession. After his death, the Japanese police immediately performed an autopsy on his body. According to the Japanese police, Wu Wancheng was working on the roof of a nearby tile house and witnessed Zheng's suicide from a distance of 3,000 steps from the Tianjie police station. (6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Arita Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>Yin Tong and Li Zeyi Welcomed Him at the Station</p>

<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Japanese Ambassador to China, Arita Akira, along with his counselor Arino and secretary Yokokawa, arrived in Beiping yesterday (the 7th) at 10:24 AM on a special carriage attached to the Ping-Hu through train from Shanghai.

After Arita alighted from the train, he proceeded to the Japanese Embassy by car. Huang Fu is scheduled to host a banquet at the Diplomatic Building tomorrow (the 9th) evening. Yesterday (the 7th) at noon, Arita met with the Chinese press corps in the embassy's main reception hall. Arino served as the translator, and the following remarks were made:</p>
<p>Reporter (Question): How long will the ambassador stay in Beiping this time? Will you be meeting with our government officials? Can you tell us your future itinerary?</p>
<p>Arita (Answer): I am stationed in China, usually in Beijing and Shanghai, so I make it a point to come to the north once a year to manage embassy affairs and take the opportunity to inspect the conditions of Chinese merchants in North China. I plan to stay in Beiping for a week this time, then return south to inspect Jinan, stay for a day or two, then go to Qingdao and take a ship back to Shanghai. If there is an opportunity in Beiping, I intend to meet with Chairman Huang for a routine visit.</p>
<p>(Question): Shanghai telegrams claim that Japan plans to expand the organization of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping in order to restore normal Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Is this true?</p>
<p>(Answer): The restoration of normal Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is indeed absolutely necessary and is the unanimous hope of officials and civilians of both China and Japan. However, I have not heard of any expansion of the Beiping Embassy organization. In my personal opinion, there is no need for it at present.</p>
<p>(Question): There have been rumors for a long time about the upgrading of Sino-Japanese diplomatic envoys, but it has not been realized. Since the upgrading of the Sino-Italian diplomatic envoys, according to Tokyo telegrams, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also planning to upgrade the Sino-Japanese diplomatic envoys. What is the progress of the recent situation? Does the ambassador think there is any possibility of realizing this rumor?</p>
<p>(Answer): The Japanese government has long decided in principle on the issue of upgrading the Japanese ambassador to China. The budget for the embassy has also been approved. However, due to the repeated emergence of problems and disputes between China and Japan, it has not been realized as scheduled. As for today, it is still difficult to predict how many days there are to the date of realization. The Japanese government is very interested in the recent upgrading of Sino-Italian diplomatic envoys. In my personal opinion, there may be an opportunity for realization in the near future, or it is within expectations.</p>
<p>(Question): In general, it is believed that the current state of Sino-Japanese diplomacy needs to be developed. In other words, it is to restore normal relations. Regarding Sino-Japanese incidents in North China, the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army has always been the negotiating partner. From the ambassador's observation, when can this situation begin to develop and move towards a normal state?</p>
<p>(Answer): The Sino-Japanese negotiation incidents in North China, so the contact with the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army is limited to those related to the Tanggu Truce. In my observation, Sino-Japanese diplomacy has recently entered a path of improvement, and it is not difficult to restore normal state, but it is also necessary for both countries to work together and be honest with each other. If you have any insights on the effort strategy, I would also like to learn from you.</p>
<p>(Question): Regarding the content of the Tanggu Truce, according to the full text announced by both China and Japan at the beginning, almost all of the obligations that China should fulfill have been fulfilled, while Japan alone claims that China still has some that have not been fulfilled. The so-called unfulfilled parts, I hope the ambassador will show frankly.</p>
<p>(Answer): The Tanggu Truce was originally a military truce. Since its signing, the various obligations to be fulfilled by both parties have differed due to different views.</p>
<p>(Question): What is the recent situation of the Sino-Eastern Railway negotiations, as the ambassador has heard?</p>
<p>(Answer): The Sino-Eastern Railway issue has not been resolved smoothly for various reasons. As for the recent situation, because Japan is not directly related, it is impossible to answer in detail. (8th)</p>
<h3>Eastern Route Army Advances from Tingzhou Towards Ganzhou</h3>
<p>Longyan Urgently Needs Relief After Being Plundered</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the Eastern Route Army units led by Li Yannian and Song Xilian arrived in Tingzhou, they immediately searched for lurking bandits and handled the aftermath. Jiang Dingwen, the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route Army, will also go from Longyan to Tingzhou to inspect. In addition to ordering a part of the army to stay in Tingzhou to handle everything, a part has continued to advance, and will soon join forces at the bandits' nest in Ruijin. Currently, there are no traces of bandits in Ruijin, Xingguo, and Yudu, and it is expected that they can all be recovered soon. The rear roads are currently being built by the stationed troops. It has been found that since Longyan County was occupied by the communist bandits, it has been six years, and the local people have suffered unspeakably. Most of the strong young men have been conscripted, leaving only the old, young, and weak. Farmers, workers, and merchants have all lost their jobs. The farmers' farming tools have been destroyed, and the merchants' capital has been exhausted. (The county is mostly engaged in papermaking.) The workers are unemployed and have no one to turn to. The various hardships are difficult to describe in words. Currently, Kang Shaowu and others, the directors of the Chaozhou-Longyan-Tingzhou Refugee Affairs Office, believe that the county has suffered greatly, and the disaster area is vast, and it is impossible for two or three charitable organizations to provide relief. Yesterday, they submitted the tragic situation of the county to the provincial government, hoping that the provincial government would consider the disaster victims, allocate a large amount of money, and quickly send personnel to handle emergency relief, and also requested permission to set up a loan office to facilitate loans for farmers and workers. At the same time, they requested that the 10,500 yuan in ocean dollars allocated by the National Government for the designated relief of Longyan in previous years be verified and handled according to the original plan.</p>
<p>In northern Fujian, the remaining bandits entrenched in Mingxi and Qingliu counties have retreated into Ninghua after the National Army recovered Tingzhou, because they lost their advantage. The county seats of the two counties have been recovered by Lu Xingrong's troops. (November 6)</p>
<h3>Jiaoji Railway Buys Boshan Light Railway</h3>
<p>Price Issues Repeatedly Negotiated</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Sends Personnel to Boshan for Investigation</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway's purchase of the Boshan Light Railway has been negotiated several times between the two parties, but no results have been achieved due to the large difference in price. The Jiaoji Railway estimated the value of the light railway at 800,000 yuan, and the light railway finally reduced it to 1 million yuan (the initial asking price was 2 million yuan). The difference is already small. Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, and Shen Honglie, the mayor of Qingdao, also telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, stating the importance of the light railway. If the Jiaoji Railway buys it, it can be changed to a branch line and extended to Laiwu, which can transport coal exports from the Lunan coal mines and prosper the local area. Please consider the value and order the Jiaoji Railway to buy it. After the Ministry of Railways approved the telegram, it has sent special commissioner Mo Jiefu and Cai Mou to Boshan to investigate the entire property and business conditions of the road, together with Tian Jinxiang of the Engineering Department of the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, Yu Renjie of the Accounting Department, and Feng Bingzeng of the Locomotive Department. Bao Zonghan, the chairman of the board of directors of the light railway, and An Jiru, the director, also came to Qingdao on the 2nd train of the Jiaoji Railway at 7:00 AM this morning (the 8th) to discuss the issue of selling the value of the road with the municipal government and the Jiaoji Railway Bureau and the issue of the position of all employees of the road. According to Bao's talk about the sale of the road, "This road has been losing money for many years due to poor management and incomplete design in the past. Since the board of directors planned to improve it, the business in the past three years has gradually improved. It is really possible to repay debts and expand business in succession. However, the government has developed the coal industry in eastern Shandong and unified road rights, so there is a proposal to buy this road. I have contacted the competent authorities several times, but the debt of this road is too heavy and the price is too high, so I have not been able to determine a method. Recently, Mo Jiefu and others sent by the Ministry of Railways have arrived in Boshan for investigation in order to make a fair estimate. However, the value of 800,000 yuan previously estimated by the Jiaoji Railway cannot be used to repay debts, and the light railway still has Japanese debt, which is even more difficult to handle. Although this road is allowed to be sold for 800,000 yuan, the Japanese will certainly not agree. Therefore, this road is really in a dilemma. This time, Director An came to Qingdao to discuss the issue of increasing the price with the Qingdao Municipal Government and the Jiaoji Railway Bureau again. The position of all employees of the road after the sale is also one of the important issues, and the resettlement method will also be discussed in detail with the Railway Bureau to maintain their livelihoods. There are no less than 1,200 employees on this road. If no plans are made in advance, their livelihoods are really worrying. I have discussed it with Hu Jiafeng, the secretary-general of the municipal government, once this afternoon, and I will go to the Jiaoji Railway Bureau again in the afternoon to discuss everything with Director Ge Guangting. Once a clue is discussed, I will return to Boshan immediately, convene a board of directors, and then decide on a method to proceed," said Bao. (8th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>County Government Convenes Baojia Training Meeting</p>
<p>The county government previously received an order from the province that baojia should be organized uniformly in various counties in Jiangnan starting in November. The Baojia Regulations were promulgated, and the county magistrates of various counties were summoned to the province to personally instruct the methods and steps for carrying out baojia. After County Magistrate Jin returned to Songjiang, he immediately informed the district chiefs, assistant members, and district investigation committees that they should all gather at the county government at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 8th) to hold a training meeting. County Magistrate Jin gave a lecture on the significance of baojia, followed by clerks Ni Chongkuan and others who lectured on the methods and steps of organization. County Magistrate Jin lectured on the responsibilities of district and township mayors this morning, and Secretary Wu Zhongyu lectured on the responsibilities of baojia chiefs this afternoon. Tomorrow, the importance of the joint bao pledge will be lectured, and discussions will begin in the afternoon. The meeting period is three days, and all district attendees attended, which is highly valued.</p>

<p>The Wai Gang Market Strike Case Ends But Not</p>
<p>In the case of the Wai Gang merchants who rioted and went on strike last month due to the Xihu Road bridge construction, after the ringleader Jiang Ada was detained by the county, the county government replied that the case of the victim's complaint had been concluded and should be judged according to law. Subsequently, Jiang Ada was sentenced to a fine of 20 yuan for jointly injuring people. Jiang has been released on bail by the Zhongnan Company. The merchants in the town learned of the situation and thought that such a major case was ended lightly by the county government, and they were dissatisfied. Yesterday, they also notified all sectors of the beginning and end of the case, and the atmosphere became tense again.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Reporters' Association Accuses Zhang Yu</p>
<p>Pan Kui, a reporter from the Xinmin Daily, was detained by Zhang Yu, the director of the first branch of the Public Security Bureau, for allegedly defrauding him of the penalty, and was forced to take off his coat, forced to freeze, and tied up to be escorted. All the newspaper reporters in this town expressed their indignation in unison. The association put forward four points to question Zhang Yu, and the situation has been recorded in this newspaper. Now it is learned that the Newspaper Reporters' Association of this town has also accused Zhang Yu, the director of the branch, of arbitrarily changing the judgment, neglecting his duties, abusing his power illegally, leading people to commit crimes, and abusing his authority illegally, which are not allowed by law. Therefore, yesterday, they specifically listed evidence and presented it to the county government's Public Security Bureau, requesting that Zhang Yu be dismissed and investigated as soon as possible in order to clean up the officialdom and rectify discipline.</p>
<p>Silk Factory Workers Strike</p>
<p>Due to the sluggish silk sales and poor business, the Huangbudun Industrial University Silk Factory has adopted a tightening policy, changing the daily working hours to a triangular shift to reduce wages and save expenses. However, after the implementation the day before yesterday, the actual working hours were longer than the full day. They have to go to work at 4:25 AM every day and stop work until 5:30 PM, which has caused the opposition of the workers in the entire factory. Yesterday, a full strike was implemented to demand improved treatment. However, the factory said that if the workers are unwilling to work, they will never force it. Currently, they are still in stalemate.</p>
<p>Two Workers Crushed to Death in Shipyard</p>
<p>The Xu Yihe Shipyard at the Xia Matou of San Mao Temple outside the West Gate was opened by Xu Rufu, a native of Taixing. Recently, a new ship was built, with a load of about 200 dan. The carpentry part has been completed. The day before yesterday (the 8th) at about 2:00 PM, more than ten workers were testing the ship (that is, embedding mud ash into the ship's seams). The supporting wood around it suddenly broke, and the ship fell, crushing to death two workers, Ji Yunhe (25 years old) and Shen Qiguan (18 years old). The other injured were Chen Qibing and Liu Tiancheng, who have been sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment and are afraid of becoming disabled. After the accident, Xu Rufu, the owner of the factory, and Chen Zizhao, the chief of the 227th Tu, reported to the local branch for inspection. The prosecutor, along with the inspector Liu, went to inspect and found that they were crushed to death. The factory owner was ordered to prepare coffins for burial.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Plans Winter Defense</p>
<p>The County Public Security Bureau recently learned that the winter defense has arrived, and it is easy for petty thieves to mix in, and it is necessary to make preparations in advance. Bureau Chief Zhou Ding specifically convened the directors and patrol officers of various branch bureaus and offices at the headquarters on the morning of the 5th to hold a meeting. The results of the discussion are as follows. During the winter defense, in addition to the necessary patrol meetings, attention should also be paid to: (1) Inspection of hotels. There are many hotels in various towns and cities in this county, and most of the travelers have not been inspected. The various branch bureaus and offices should pay attention to inspection and registration to avoid criminals hiding. (2) Attention to wharfs. Regardless of the steamships or sailing ships within the jurisdiction of the various branch bureaus and offices, personnel should be dispatched to inspect them when they arrive at the wharf to clean up the source of bandits. (3) Collection of township dingle-men. The township dingle-men have a close relationship with the Public Security Bureau, but the various branch bureaus and offices consider their position to be low and have never convened talks to give them appropriate contact, which is a mistake. These people have a low position, and it is more convenient to investigate robbers, so it is necessary to convene talks on a regular basis to give them contact and achieve the effect of public security.</p>
<p>Patrol Officer Insults Newspaper Case Resolved</p>
<p>Gu Ben, the current patrol officer of the fifth branch of the Public Security Bureau, was previously accused of hiding opium. When the county government convened a court hearing, Gu said, "Changshu newspapers are all worthless," which aroused the resentment of various newspaper offices. The county judiciary accused Gu, a patrol officer, of publicly insulting and slandering criminals. The county government once opened a trial. Gu entrusted someone to reconcile, but did not appear in court to defend himself at that time. Now I learned that Cheng Jingchuan, the director of the port branch, and Song Song, the patrol officer of the third branch, have tried their best to mediate, and now the matter has been concluded. As a result, Gu, the patrol officer, published a statement clarifying the misunderstanding and apologizing to the various newspaper offices. The various newspaper offices that jointly filed the lawsuit withdrew their complaints from the county government. From then on, a storm has come to an end.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Bandits Land in Juegang to Plunder</p>
<p>Thirteen bandit ships have suddenly arrived in the Changsha Beikan area along the coast of Juegang, and 300 to 400 bandits have landed to plunder the countryside and nearby towns, seizing grain and grass, as well as cattle, sheep, pigs, mules, and poultry. Merchants and fishermen along the coast have all fled.</p>
<p>Suppressing Qidong Disbanded Soldiers</p>
<p>Recently, some disbanded soldiers carrying weapons have landed on the coast of Qidong. It is said that they are maritime guerrillas. Zheng, the commissioner of the Nantong District, reported to the county magistrate Li, and telegraphed the provincial security office for instructions. On the 8th, he received a telegram reply stating that the maritime guerrillas had been transferred to the province for reorganization, and there were no remaining disbanded soldiers flowing into the sea. It is important to order strict defense and suppress them as appropriate. The special office sent a security team to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>County Government Investigates Bribery and Fraud Case</p>
<p>Officials inside and outside the county government's Land Tax Office colluded and committed fraud. Commissioner Bao sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that the entire team of string officials was suspended. Yu Zhaozhen and others with more serious circumstances were guarded. On the 7th, personnel were summoned from various agencies to conduct spot checks. It was found that the original amount of food substitutes in 1933 was only more than 7,000 yuan, which was one-half less than the split substitutes of more than 14,000 yuan, while the split substitutes exceeded more than 7,000 yuan, which was obviously suspected of being forged. A sound investigation plan is now being drawn up to solve the problem thoroughly. Yesterday (the 8th), Zhai Yongkang, who was on the run, was found by his original guarantor Wang Yupei at the Dong'an Hotel in Jiuanli, Simalu, Shanghai. He surrendered himself in the afternoon. At about 9:00 PM, Secretary Bao and the chiefs of the Second Section, Gu Wenhua, and the accounting director, Ma Daying, interrogated them together in the inner room. According to the confessions of Jiang Jiuyu, Yu Zhaozhen, Zhai Baozi, and Zhai Guanghuan, each person had a deficit of more than 1,000 yuan or 200 to 300 yuan in 1933. The split substitutes were handled by Zhai Shaopeng (who had fled). They often gathered at the Taihetang Pharmacy on West Street to discuss ways to make up for it, and gamble and smoke. There were also 1919 general package substitute tickets and 1920 civilian debt books, which were owed by the former land tax director Chen Ruizhang and had not been handed over. There were also deficits, and we did not understand, etc. When questioned by Zhai Yongkang, he did not admit to fleeing, but only owed more than 500 yuan in 1933. Now it is found that the forged substitutes were handled by Zhai Shaopeng. When questioned about the inside story of flying string fraud, Zhai hesitated. The interrogation ended at about 11:00 PM and ordered them to be detained separately for review.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Hangjiang Road Approved to Levy Surtaxes</p>
<p>Due to the severe drought this year and the large number of disaster victims in Zhejiang Province, the provincial relief committee considered that the victims were starving and waiting to be fed this winter. In order to raise relief funds, it not only requested the provincial government to allocate funds to hold winter relief first, but also transferred to the central government by the provincial government to approve the levy of transportation surtaxes to fill the needs of relief funds. According to the order of the Executive Yuan, the Hangjiang Railway was approved to levy a surtax of 10%, which will be implemented from December 1st for a period of one year. Regarding the winter relief funds, the provincial government decided yesterday to allocate 1 million yuan of local public debt for the relief committee to use.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>Forced Abortion Leads to Death</p>
<p>Zhang Wenkang, a villager in the Fourth District Hequn Township, went to Shanghai to work in March of last year and has not returned to this day. His wife, Ms. Lu, was seduced by Mao Zhengcai, a neighbor, and became pregnant for several months. Mao was afraid of being known, so he forced her to have an abortion the day before yesterday (the 5th). She took the medicine, but her abdomen was painful, and the fetus did not come down. She died that night. Mao saw that the disaster had happened and fled without a trace. The next day (the 6th), Zhang Qi Quan, the uncle of Zhang Wenli, reported to the county government. Chen, the assessor, went to inspect and confirmed that it was true. Yesterday (the 7th), Lu Chen, the mother of Ms. Lu, and Mao Shunde, the nephew of Mao Zhengcai, were arrested and interrogated together.</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Said Decision to Go South Again Has Not Been Made</p>
<p>Central Committee member Wang Chonghui went to Peiping this time to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and arrived in Shanghai from Peiping yesterday morning at 8:00 AM on the Peiping-Shanghai through train. Sun Danlin and others came with him. After getting off the train, he went directly to the Fan Garden on Hague Road to rest. Mr. Wang will stay in Shanghai temporarily and wait for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go south. Whether to go to Hong Kong after visiting again will be decided at that time. The details are recorded in the following:</p>
<p>Visit to Chiang</p>
<p>After Wang arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, he told visiting reporters that he had visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek three times during this trip to the north. The first two times were in the Xiehe Hospital because Chiang was examining his body. After Chiang was discharged from the hospital, he visited again. However, Chiang was very busy with official duties, and the chairmen of various provinces were waiting to meet him, so he was unable to have a long conversation. He only briefly described the experience of contacting him during this trip to the south. Later, because Chiang went to Suiyuan, he also left Peiping and came to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Undecided to Go South</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek already fully understands the opinions of the comrades in the southwest and has asked me to visit him again when he returns south, so that he can have a detailed discussion. I will stay in Shanghai for a short time and do not intend to go elsewhere for the time being. As for whether I will go south again to convey the opinions of both parties, it will also be decided after visiting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>Going Abroad at the End of the Year</p>
<p>Wang also said that the situation in North China is more stable than before, but he feels that the market is slightly more sluggish than before the capital moved south. The vacation period for my return to China this time is six months, and it has not expired yet. I will probably set off at the end of this year and return to The Hague to cancel the vacation.</p>
<p>Optimistic About the Future</p>
<p>When the reporter asked again whether he was optimistic about the future of this trip, Wang replied that of course there was some hope. Fortunately, the Fifth National Congress has now decided to postpone the meeting, so both parties can have ample opportunity to discuss each other. The future may not be unoptimistic.</p>
<h3>Chiang Bo-cheng Boards Ship to Guangdong Last Night</h3>
<p>Had a Long Talk with Wang Chonghui Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Chiang Bo-cheng, a member of the Beiping Military Branch, went north to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and then returned to Shanghai. He originally planned to go to Guangdong as soon as possible to represent Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and be stationed to handle everything. Now he has been waiting to meet Wang Chonghui and has stayed in Shanghai. When Wang arrived in Shanghai from Peiping yesterday morning, Chiang drove to visit Wang at about 10:00 AM and had a long talk. Chiang's official duties have been completed. Last night at 9:00 PM, he boarded the President Lincoln at the Xinguang Wharf and was scheduled to set sail for Hong Kong at 5:00 AM this morning. After Chiang arrives in Hong Kong, he will go directly to Guangzhou to meet with Chen Jitang and others to convey Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's opinions.</p>
<h3>Liu Wentao Flew to Hankou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Liu Wentao, my country's ambassador to Italy, arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Beijing the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at about 7:00 AM, he took the China Aviation Corporation's Yichang airplane to Hankou and arrived at about 2:30 PM in the afternoon. Mr. Liu is scheduled to stay in Hankou for a while, then go to Wuchang and Changsha to visit old friends, and then return to Wuxue, his hometown, to sweep the tombs. Then he will come to Shanghai to prepare his luggage and go abroad to return to his post.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Foreign Affairs Urging Conclusion of Sino-Persian Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Involves Silk and Tea Exports</p>
<p>Urgent Need for Measures to Save the Situation</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Persian commercial treaty, the government has not yet drafted it. Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce again cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating: "To the esteemed Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the 8th of this month, we received a letter from the Silk Industry Association, stating that according to a letter from the Shandong and Henan silk associations, in the past, among our country's native products sold to Persia, in addition to Chinese tea, Chinese silk was also a major export. Since Persia established unequal tariff treaties, both tea and silk have almost disappeared from the Persian market. However, Chinese tea merchants previously requested the City Chamber of Commerce to forward a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, urging the conclusion of a Sino-Persian commercial treaty of mutual benefit in order to save the situation. The sales of Chinese tea in Persia have been negotiated several times, but no satisfactory result has been achieved. However, due to the business and livelihood involved, they continue to strive tirelessly. Recently, the cocoon and silk business has become increasingly depressed, and shipments to Persia have suddenly ceased. After investigating the reasons, it is purely due to the impact of tariffs. Therefore, we request that you forward this to the authorities to expedite the conclusion of a Sino-Persian reciprocal commercial treaty as soon as possible, in order to develop native products and foreign trade. We await your instructions with utmost urgency. We have learned that the shipment of cocoons and silk to Persia has now ceased completely, and the suffering is indeed the same as that of tea merchants. According to the previous letter, we are correspondingly informing you and earnestly requesting your association to forward this to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting that you expedite the conclusion of a Sino-Persian commercial treaty of mutual benefit to facilitate the export of native products. We would be deeply grateful. According to a previous letter from the Foreign Tea Industry Association, the association forwarded a request by telegraph in July. Subsequently, we received a reply from your ministry stating that a Sino-Persian commercial treaty is currently under negotiation between the two parties and has reached a considerable degree of progress. The industry believes that due to the importance of shipments, they cannot wait any longer, and in August, they sent another letter requesting a telegraphic urging. The association again presented a request to your ministry by telegraph, requesting your prompt approval, which has been filed. Several months have passed, and we have not yet received approval, indicating that the commercial treaty is unlikely to be concluded in the near future, which is quite obvious. Now, we have also received a letter from the Silk Industry Association to the same effect, indicating that both the tea and silk industries in Persia are almost extinct due to the lack of a treaty and high taxes. The longer this situation persists, the harder it will be to salvage. Recently, foreign trade has already plummeted. Tea and silk are vital to agriculture and commerce. If even the market in West Asia is completely lost, then our country will have one less avenue for developing foreign trade. Your ministry is well aware of the people's difficulties and should plan for this as soon as possible. If the commercial treaty is not yet in sight, could it be possible to follow the precedent of our country's past practice with Egypt, as requested in the association's July telegram, and have representatives of both countries exchange documents to save the situation? We await your instructions with utmost urgency." Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully.</p>

<h3>Jiahe Steamer Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Three Crew Members Still Missing</p>
<p>Sergeant Su Reports on the Incident</p>
<p>The Jiahe steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was robbed and hijacked, arrived in Shanghai at 1:50 PM yesterday and docked at the Jinliyuan Xinjiangtian Wharf. The shipowner, Sha Zengjia, the chief mate, Cui Tingming, and others reported to the bureau. Yesterday, reporters interviewed crew members about the details of the incident, who told them the following details about the robbery:</p>
<p>Robbers Sneak In</p>
<p>Before the Jiahe steamer left Shantou on the morning of the 4th, two pirates disguised themselves as coolies and boarded the ship to reserve cabins. The steward showed them around. The two pirates initially wanted official cabins, but after the steward showed them one by one, they suddenly didn't want them. Then, they reserved two seats in the steerage. In fact, when reserving the seats, they were actually scouting the entrance and exit routes and the location of the ship's police. They paid a deposit of twenty dollars each. When ordinary passengers disembarked, another ten pirates sneaked in, totaling twelve pirates. They bought ten tickets in total. Two pirates did not buy tickets. All the pirates were dressed in short clothes like coolies, and the handguns they carried were very small, so they could be hidden. The ship sailed at around 6:00 AM on the 4th. Local military police checked the passengers as usual, but did not search out the pirates' weapons.</p>
<p>Checking Tickets</p>
<p>The Jiahe steamer sailed from Shantou to Xiamen at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 4th. There were only over thirty passengers on board, including the pirates, and they were all steerage passengers. At around 9:00 AM, the ship arrived at the port of Shantou. As usual, passenger tickets were checked by an accountant, a police squad leader, and two policemen. When checking the steerage at the stern of the ship, they found two pirates who had not purchased tickets. They initially claimed they had no money to buy tickets. The usual practice on board is to search the person's belongings if they have no money to buy tickets. Unexpectedly, searching the pirates led to the attack.</p>
<p>Killing the Policeman</p>
<p>At that time, taking advantage of the police's unpreparedness, one of the pirates raised a handgun and pointed it at the policeman Yang Zetian, shouting for him to raise his hands. Two other pirates suddenly jumped out and grabbed Squad Leader Su and policeman Wu Jinyin, preventing Wu from drawing his holster gun. At this moment, the policeman Yang, who was pointed at with a gun, was caught off guard and ran wildly towards the outside of the steerage, intending to draw his gun. The pirates would not let him go and chased after him. Yang ran down the ladder, and the pirates fired two shots from behind. One bullet hit Yang's head, and the other hit his waist. Yang still managed to escape into Room 5 while wounded, and quickly closed the door, thinking of confronting them. Unexpectedly, the pirates had already chased him and fired two more shots at Room 5. Policeman Yang immediately fell to the ground after being shot.</p>
<p>Forced to Surrender Weapons</p>
<p>After the pirates fired their guns, Squad Leader Su and policeman Wu Jinyin's guns were confiscated. Wu was also shot in the back of the head while walking to the middle cabin. Then, they forced their way to the bridge. It happened that Chief Mate Cui Tingming was on duty. Suddenly, he heard three gunshots. When he asked what was happening, the steward said that the police were probably testing their guns. Before he finished speaking, the pirates had arrived. Without asking any questions, they pointed a gun at Cui and asked who he was. Cui said he was the chief mate. The pirates immediately ordered Cui to surrender his weapons. Cui replied that he had no gun. Four pirates still held Cui with their guns, forcing him to go to the police room to collect the remaining four policemen's holster guns. At this time, Squad Leader Liu in the police room had already received the news and quickly led policemen Xu Fulin and Zhang Yutian, each with a loaded gun, planning to fight the pirates. At that time, the front and rear cabins had been cut off by the pirates, and the situation was very dangerous.</p>
<p>Threatening the Shipowner</p>
<p>Chief Mate Cui was taken to the police room by four pirates. As they were walking to the ladder, Squad Leader Su had already loaded his gun and hid by the ladder, planning to kill the four pirates in one fell swoop. As the pirates approached, he immediately fired his gun, but he was seen by a steward who was shocked and quickly asked Squad Leader Liu not to fire. If he fired, the chief mate would be killed first. The pirates also threatened that if anyone was hurt, they would set fire to the ship and perish together. Under this threat, Chief Mate Cui also quickly stopped Liu and the others from resisting and quickly handed over the four guns to the pirates. The pirates then forced him to go to the shipowner's room and forced the shipowner, Sha Zengjia, to turn the ship around and sail south.</p>
<p>Monitoring the Crew</p>
<p>Since the Jiahe steamer changed direction and sailed south, all the crew members were monitored by the pirates. The radio had been damaged by the pirates, so they could not report the incident. The pirates prohibited all passengers and sailors from leaving their cabins, otherwise they would be shot. They also sent pirates to patrol and take turns on guard. The pirate leader, who was about fifty years old, wore ragged clothes. He gave orders mostly in English. Among the pirates, some spoke Cantonese and some spoke the Shantou dialect. They used the main dining room as their meeting place.</p>
<p>Dividing Up the Loot</p>
<p>The pirates looted in batches for over twenty-two hours. First, they robbed the passengers. One student was robbed of over two hundred dollars, a monk was robbed of three hundred and fifty dollars, a money shop employee was robbed of over four hundred dollars, a peddler was robbed of over a thousand small dollars, the accounting room was robbed of over two hundred dollars, and two company men were robbed of ninety-three dollars. The cash carried by the sailors was also swept away. After the cash was looted, they searched for clothing. The total loss was estimated to be over one thousand eight hundred dollars in cash, not counting the clothing and other items.</p>
<p>Opening the Cabins for Inspection</p>
<p>Then, they ordered the business director, Shen Qinxiang, to hand over the cash. Shen told them that the ship was empty when it departed from Shantou and had no cargo and no cash on board. The pirates did not believe him. After showing them the manifest, they forced him to hand over the keys to the various cabins and opened them for inspection. Only then did the pirates believe him.</p>
<p>Forcing a Fishing Boat</p>
<p>The next morning at 6:00 AM, the ship arrived about five nautical miles from Shanwei. The pirates wanted to leave the ship, but there were no fishing boats available for them to board. The pirate leader ordered the shipowner to release a sampan into the sea to look for a fishing boat. The shipowner said that the sampan was too small and might capsize at sea. The Jiahe steamer then searched on their behalf. Later, they saw a fishing boat near Shanwei sailing forward with full sails. The Jiahe steamer chased after it. The pirates shouted for them to lower their sails. The fishing boat initially did not pay attention. After the pirates fired four shots, the fishing boat quickly lowered its sails and stopped. The Jiahe approached, and the pirates transferred the loot to the boat and left.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Crew Members</p>
<p>When the pirates were about to leave, they said that the money they had looted was not much and they were still losing money. Therefore, they had to kidnap five crew members to go with them. In addition to the business director, Shen Qinxiang, the accountant, Li Xiaobin, and the cargo supervisor, Ge Liangchen, who had been decided to be kidnapped, the two compradors, Qiu Quanneng, and the third compradore, someone, were also kidnapped together. The two had already been dragged to the side of the ship by the pirates when a helmsman told the pirate leader that these two were only in charge of small matters such as managing the receipt and dispatch of goods. The pirate leader said that since they were not the two compradors, let them go. Qiu and others were just lucky to escape being kidnapped. It was also heard that the pirates were afraid that the Jiahe steamer would sink the fishing boat they were on, so they kidnapped Shen and the others to serve as protection and also to extort a large sum of money.</p>
<p>Transporting the Casket</p>
<p>The policeman Yang Zetian, who was shot and killed by the pirates, was initially going to be thrown into the sea by the pirates. However, after the shipowner and others pleaded, they were spared. Wu Jinyin, who was wounded, was wounded in the head. The Jiahe steamer sailed to Xiamen on the morning of the 6th. The deceased was placed in the ship's coffin, and the injured were sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday afternoon at 1:15 PM, the Jiahe sailed back to Shanghai and docked at the Jinliyuan Xinjiangtian Wharf. When policeman Yang's coffin was brought ashore, it was covered with the bureau's flag, indicating that he had been injured in the line of duty. Yang's wife cried loudly while supporting the coffin, and the scene was extremely tragic. The injured Wu Jinyin also came to Shanghai with the ship. After arriving, the bureau sent him to the hospital for treatment. The shipowner and chief mate reported the incident to the bureau. The crew members' clothing and money had all been taken, and they had to buy new clothes after arriving in Shanghai. After the cargo on board was unloaded, the ship was taken out of service and sent to the factory for repairs.</p>
<p>Original Report</p>
<p>Su Yunbo and Liu Jingquan, the guard squad leaders on the ship, submitted a detailed report to the headquarters yesterday regarding the hijacking. The original text is as follows: "Report on the hijacking incident. We departed from Shantou at 7:00 AM on the 4th of this month, bound for Xiamen. We went off duty from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. From 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM, Squad Leader Su led Yang Zetian and Wu Jinyin on duty. When passengers boarded in Shantou, we still checked the thirty-odd male and female passengers as usual. At 8:50 PM, unexpectedly, pirates took advantage of the on-duty officers' unpreparedness and hugged them around the waist. The on-duty officers immediately drew their guns and fired. However, another pirate had already fired his gun first. Because the on-duty officers were held tightly by several pirates, they were unable to counterattack freely. As a result, Yang Zetian was shot three times and died, and Wu Jinyin was shot twice and injured. Only one pirate was injured in the foot. Yang and Wu's guns were then seized, and they went up to the bridge, threatening the captain and chief mate to surrender their weapons and sail to Hong Kong, otherwise the entire ship would be sacrificed. At that time, Squad Leader Liu heard the noise and led Xu Fulin and others to fight the remaining pirates. Before long, two pirates escorted the chief mate to the stern of the ship, ordering us to surrender our weapons. Squad Leader Liu and others saw that the front and rear were already cut off, and the chief mate was also in the middle of the pirates. If we resisted, we would only sacrifice the lives and property of the entire ship. Therefore, we obeyed the order and surrendered our weapons. After all the guns were handed over to the pirates, we were monitored by several pirates, while the other pirates arbitrarily searched and robbed passengers and crew members. At 6:00 AM on the morning of the 5th, the ship arrived at Shanwei. The pirates fired two shots into the sea, seized a fishing boat and tied it up alongside, and moved all the luggage, boxes, and other items down. It is estimated that the passengers and crew members were robbed of over one thousand eight hundred and eighty dollars in cash and countless clothes, worth several hundred dollars. They kidnapped compradors Shen Qinxiang, accountant Li Xiaobin, and Ge Liangchen. At 6:30 AM, the ship turned around and sailed back to Xiamen (omitted below)."</p>

<p>(Central News Agency) The National Government's Construction Committee has borrowed 3.7 million yuan from banks in Beijing and Shanghai to expand the two power plants in the capital, Qishuyan, and complete the Huainan Railway.

After convening a meeting of the banks, the amount of the loan, the interest rate, the repayment method, and the payment method were agreed upon. The contract was formally signed in Shanghai on the 31st of last month. Zhang Renjie, Chairman of the Construction Committee, signed the contract. Representatives from each bank also signed the contract. A general contract was signed.</p>

Banks in Nanjing jointly lent 200,000 yuan. In total, the above amount will form a syndicate, with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications as representatives to collect the principal and interest due and then distribute it to each participating bank.</p>
<p>Repayment Method</p>
<p>The interest rate on the loan is 9% per annum. The repayment date is set to start in June 1936, with principal and interest repaid every six months, in a total of seven installments. Principal of 200,000 yuan will be repaid on June 30th of each year, and principal of 250,000 yuan will be repaid on December 31st of each year, until June 30, 1939. The collateral is all the property and income of the Huainan Coal Mine Railway and the Capital Power Plant and Qishuyan Power Plant.</p>
<p>Payment Method</p>
<p>The contract also stipulates the payment method, which is from October 31st of this year to January 31st of the 25th year of the Republic of China, which will be paid in six installments.

It is expected to be paid in a few days.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Import of Miscellaneous Silver for Shanghai Banking Association Without Prohibition</h3>
<p>Inland Debased Currency Can Be Requested to Be Recast into New Currency</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Silver Exchange Can Be Established Soon</p>
<p>According to the Shiye News Agency, the Shanghai Banking Association previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to lift the ban on the import of miscellaneous silver coins and bullion due to the difficulty in importing overseas standard silver after the Ministry of Finance implemented the new export tax rate on silver, while domestic silver continued to be exported, and miscellaneous silver coins and bullion could not circulate, leading to domestic economic depletion. Yesterday, the association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, Qian Zi No. 8396, stating: "The submission has been noted. The claim that overseas standard silver is difficult to import after the implementation of the silver export tax and the request to lift the ban on the import of miscellaneous silver coins and bullion to increase the silver reserves in Shanghai is understood as being for the purpose of replenishing Shanghai's silver reserves. The Ministry has no prohibitive regulations on the import of miscellaneous silver. Merchants and citizens who hold such miscellaneous silver may transport it to Shanghai and request the Central Mint to mint new coins in accordance with Article 11 of the Silver Standard Coinage Regulations. As for inland debased currency, which is said to be uncommon in the market, holders may also request coinage in accordance with Article 11, Section 3 of the same regulations. If it is commonly used silver coinage, it should be handled in accordance with the Ministry's regulations on prohibiting the circulation of silver coins. Regarding the exchange of broken silver and silverware, the Ministry has already agreed with the Central Bank to establish a Miscellaneous Silver Exchange, which will be established in the near future. In the future, miscellaneous silver and decorative silver can be brought to the Central Bank for exchange. Please take note of this order." According to Ge Huaiqing of the Association, speaking to a Shiye News Agency reporter, the Association received an order from the Ministry today (yesterday) instructing them to wait for the establishment of the Central Bank's Miscellaneous Silver Exchange in the near future before requesting exchange, and stated that there were no restrictions on imports. The Association will comply with the order and wait quietly for the establishment of the Exchange before requesting the exchange of miscellaneous silver in accordance with the law.</p>

During the banquet, Yan Fuqing, the president of the association, stood up and gave a welcoming speech, stating that Mr. Hu was very concerned about the association's construction of the Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium and was eager to contact the association on this return to the country to independently donate the construction of a building. His enthusiastic support was admirable. He said that it was a great honor to have Mr. Hu present at this event amidst his busy schedule, and it was also an honor to have the guests and directors attend. He continued that it was most unfortunate for a person to suffer from leprosy, which was more painful than any other disease. Therefore, Mr. Hu was more enthusiastic about leprosy relief than any other charitable act, such as his recent donations to the leprosy hospital on Hainan Island in Guangdong and the renovation of the leprosy hospital at the Xiamen Civilian Factory. Mr. Hu was truly a great savior in the leprosy world. Subsequently, Zhu Shaoping, the acting secretary-general, reported on the association's affairs, stating that Mr. Hu had long agreed to help build the leprosy sanatorium and had come to fulfill his wish. The day before yesterday, Mr. Hu went to see the site and was very pleased, hoping that we would build the leprosy sanatorium as soon as possible, so we should express our gratitude to Mr. Hu today. Finally, Wu Liande delivered a reply on behalf of Hu Wenhu, stating that Mr. Hu had been abroad for a long time and was somewhat unfamiliar with the local dialect, so he had asked his brother to deliver the speech on his behalf. First, he thanked everyone for their warm welcome. Second, regarding the construction of the leprosy sanatorium, Mr. Hu had already told his brother that he was willing to help and had asked his brother to handle everything. Since the principle had already been agreed upon, the subsequent implementation would be easily resolved. It was already 10:00 PM, and everyone dispersed in joy.</p>
<h3>Haining Drought Relief Association Requests Dredging of Rivers</h3>
<p>The Haining Drought Relief Association office in Shanghai, believing that the central government had approved the issuance of public bonds by Zhejiang Province and had decided to allocate 11 million yuan for disaster relief, submitted a special report to the three departments of the Zhejiang Provincial Government (Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction) and the Provincial Relief Association yesterday, stating, "In order to provide relief for famine, the severity of the disaster should be considered. The severity of the disaster in Haining has been repeatedly reported, and the appeals have been exhausting. If it is said that there is no evidence, then the on-site investigation by the county magistrate of this county and the survey by the Zhejiang Relief Association have both confirmed that the autumn harvest is less than 10%, and the degree of disaster is the highest in the province. There is clear evidence. According to reports, the plan to dredge rivers as a form of work relief does not include important rivers in Haining, which is astonishing. If it is said that the disaster in Haining is so severe that it is not necessary to carry out work relief, the authorities cannot bear to say so. If it is said that there are no important rivers in Haining that need to be dredged, then it does not correspond to the facts. If it is said that there are important rivers in areas with less severe disasters that need to be dredged, and immigrants can be employed, then able-bodied men who are content with their home will suffer the pain of displacement, and the elderly, weak, women, and children will suddenly lose their livelihoods and will inevitably sit and wait for death, which does not correspond to the purpose of disaster relief. Haining is located between the two old prefectural cities of Hangzhou and Jiaxing and has always been an important town in western Zhejiang. Its rivers are all connected to the upper and lower reaches, which are not limited to one county. For example, the 60-li Tang River and the 25-li Tang River are connected to the Upper Tang River, directly reaching Hangzhou County. In the past, the water from West Lake flowed down, and the water pumped from the river this year had to pass through these rivers. The 60-li Tang River has been silted up for a long time, and the 25-li Tang River has also lost its dredging, so in the summer of this year, the water from the Upper Tang River could not reach the fields east of Haining County, and the coastal fields suffered greatly. This is the first river that should be dredged. The Bishiang Tang River runs across the central part of Ningyi and carries the water of the Tiaoxi River. Its tributaries are distributed throughout Haining County, such as the Luotang River, Guodian Tang River, and Yuanhua Tang River. They flow northeast into Jiaxing to reach Jiangsu and enter the Suzhou River. One branch of the Yuanhua Tang River is connected to the Mao River to the east, and one branch of the Luotang River connects to Tongxiang Chongde in the north. They have not been repaired for a long time, so the Bishiang Tang River itself has dried up first, and the Zhaodian Tang River, Yuanhua Tang River, and Luotang River have also cracked, looking like thoroughfares. In the past, they were used for boating, but now they are used for vehicles. No wonder the fields throughout the territory have lost irrigation and have evolved into an unprecedented disaster. Tongxiang Chongde Jiaxing and the upper reaches have been cut off, and they are also lamenting the drought. Therefore, the rivers within the territory of Ningyi are not limited to one county. If you want to save the fields in the coastal counties, you should dredge the 25-li Tang River and the 60-li Tang River. If you want to save the fields in Jiaxing, Chongde, and Tongxiang counties, you should dredge the Bishiang Tang River, Guodian Tang River, and Yuanhua Tang River. The facts are clear and can be reviewed. (Omitted below)"</p>
<h3>Thirteenth Batch of Expelled Overseas Chinese from Japan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reportedly Detained in Police Station for a Month</p>
<p>More to Arrive in Shanghai from Japan Soon</p>
<p>The number of expelled overseas Chinese from Japan is continuous. The thirteenth batch, Lin Jinyuan, Chen Zhichang, and two others, arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese ship Asamaru at 8:00 AM yesterday. They are staying with friends in Hongkou and plan to return to their hometowns today. According to Lin Jinyuan, one of the expelled overseas Chinese, speaking to a Japanese news reporter, "We are from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, and have been working as laborers in the Minami Senju factory in Tokyo, Japan, for seven or eight years. At the beginning of last month, the Minami Senju police station sent police to the factory to expel us. We were first detained for a month, and then at the beginning of this month, we were escorted onto the Asamaru to return to our country. At that time, there were more than 20 people detained in total. In addition to those who have returned to their country one after another, there are still several people in the police station who will also be expelled and returned to their country in the coming days."</p>
<h3>Taixing Yangzha Port Sends Representatives to Shanghai to Raise Funds to Build a Tide-Resistant Bridge</h3>
<p>Taixing Yangzha Port is located on the Yangtze River. There was originally a tide-resistant bridge, which was an important transportation route for passengers to get on and off ships and for Xingkou motor vehicles. The bridge is now severely damaged, and walking and boating are extremely dangerous. The area is barren and the people are poor, and the market is desolate, making it difficult to rebuild. The District Office has organized a bridge construction preparatory committee and sent representatives Jiang Sufang and others to Shanghai, bringing with them donation books, receipts, and fundraising documents. They are staying at the Taixing Wine Industry Association at 184 Taiping Lane, Xianhua Street, and are appealing to people from all walks of life in Shanghai to donate money to facilitate the construction, which will greatly benefit travelers.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Provides Relief to Disaster-Stricken Provinces in Southeast China</h3>
<p>The United Office of the Chinese Southeast Chapters of the World Red Swastika Society, in view of the severe disasters in the southeastern provinces this year, has repeatedly convened meetings and sent representatives to the Beijing General Assembly to appeal to the general assembly for disaster victims, and has also sent letters to the Red Swastika Societies across the country, requesting their full assistance. It is now learned that the organization has concrete measures for disaster relief in various places, which are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Distribution of Relief Funds: The organization has allocated 57,000 yuan to Jiangsu Province, 27,000 yuan to Zhejiang Province, 18,000 yuan to Anhui Province, 5,000 yuan to Fujian Province, and 2,000 yuan to Hubei Province. Additional relief funds will be allocated to the disaster areas in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces first.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Personnel in Various Regions: The organization has nominated Li Tianzhen, Hua Qidao, Cai Quchen, Xie Guanneng, Wu Heguang, Lu Zhiqi, Hu Hongdan, Liu Huigen, Shi Xiding, and Lin Cizhong as special disaster relief commissioners for Jiangsu Province; Zhao Yulin, Chen Fuyin, Qian Chunren, Fan Zanjun, and Jin Jianguang as special disaster relief commissioners for Zhejiang Province; and Ni Duc, Zhou Genjing, Li Kairang, Yuan Zantai, and Zhou Yujue as special disaster relief commissioners for Anhui Province. The relief funds allocated to Fujian and Hubei provinces will be allocated to the temporary relief offices stationed in Fuzhou and the Wuhan office for handling.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Report: Disaster relief commissioners from various provinces have successively departed to conduct inspections. In Liyang County, Changzhen District, commissioners Shi Xiding, Li Tianzhen, and others have drafted eight inspection measures and dispatched more than 50 relief workers to investigate six districts. There are 45,000 households affected by the disaster in the county, with a population of more than 200,000. The investigation is expected to be completed in about two weeks. All relief flour has been ordered in Xihu and is being shipped continuously. Other counties and the Changtai office are also discussing and proceeding. In the capital area, such as Jiangpu County, commissioners Wu Heguang, Lin Cizhong, and others have dispatched Ouyang Dulin to lead relief workers to investigate various districts and order red grain for relief. Jiangning and Lishui counties are also under investigation, and Commissioner Xie Guanneng has purchased 5,000 sets of cotton clothing for distribution. Zhejiang Provincial Disaster Relief Commissioner Zhao Yulin has arrived in Haining, and County Magistrate An Zhen is investigating the fourth district of the county. The investigation of the 26 townships in the district has begun and will be completed in two weeks. Many of the disaster victims in the townships are suffering from diseases due to unclean drinking water, and thousands of doses of various medicines brought with them have been distributed. Commissioner Qian Chunren reported that the investigation of the four townships in the fifth district of Jiaxing County has been completed. There are 654 disaster-stricken households with 1,830 people who cannot survive without relief. It has been decided to distribute flour, once a month, requiring more than 6,000 bags of flour for five months. The Wanzhongnan office is reportedly convening a meeting to prepare for disaster relief in Anhui Province, as the allocated relief funds are insufficient for distribution.</p>
<h3>Road Association Seeks Members Both Domestically and Internationally</h3>
<p>Judicial Department Team and Honolulu Team Formed Yesterday</p>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association is seeking members, and this has been reported previously in local and overseas newspapers. It has recently been learned that the association received a letter from Xie Guansheng, Vice Minister of the Judicial Administration Department, reporting that he is serving as the chief captain and is actively preparing to form the team, which will be completed in the coming days. At the same time, Consul General Mei Jingzhou stationed in Honolulu sent a letter reporting that the Honolulu team has been formed. The team leaders and members are all overseas Chinese leaders in the area, such as Du Huisheng and Liang Gongxi, who are the presidents of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chen Qiao, who is the chief manager of the Chinese Association, Tan Xuexu, who is the general secretary of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and Li Lianhuang, Lin Liudeng, Xu Yiyang, Fan Cihe, and Huang Deryu, who are all managers and directors in the business community. This shows that people at home and abroad are willing to actively participate in the importance of road construction. The association has decided to announce the scores every ten days for comparison and statistics. It is reported that the association will hold its second score announcement period at the association's location at 70 Guba Road from 4:00 to 6:00 PM today (Saturday). The officers and staff of the various teams from outside the country are enthusiastically submitting their membership fees, and it is expected that the results will be considerable at that time.</p>
<h3>Tram and Automobile Collide</h3>
<p>Car Destroyed, but Fortunately No One Was Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:40 PM, a black-plated private sedan car with the number 3477 was traveling north on North Zhejiang Road. When it was traveling on Qipu Road, a sixth-route tram was traveling south, and another seventh-route tram was traveling north at the same time. The driver of the car tried to overtake the seventh-route tram, but due to a delay, the car was caught between the two trams. Fortunately, the drivers of the two trams were alert and braked immediately, but the car had already been crushed. Fortunately, the female passengers and the driver in the car were not injured, which was very fortunate. Afterwards, the patrol officer at the scene took the car driver to the police station for questioning, and the police chief dispatched detectives to investigate. The original stolen goods were returned to the driver who received them.</p>

<h3>Amendments to Criminal Law Spark Reaction from Women in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Meeting Held Yesterday to Decide to Send Representatives to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>Female Students of Law and Politics College Issue Telegram</p>
<p>The women's community in Shanghai held a meeting at the Bankers' Association at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon regarding the recently amended Criminal Law by the Legislative Yuan, which is one-sided. More than ten people attended, including Chen Fengxi, Chen Weijiang, Cai Kui, Cai Jinying, Jiang Huiro, Yang Zhihao, Chen Lingyi, Wang Ruizhu, Liu Wang Liming, and Liu Ping Jichen, and more than twenty people from the press were also invited. Wang Ruizhu presided over the meeting and reported that Chinese women have been subjected to various oppressions and unequal restrictions, resulting in the past situation of valuing men over women. Although the call for equal rights for men and women has spread throughout the world, the true equal rights for men and women in our country have not yet been realized. The various articles of the Criminal Law recently passed by the Legislative Yuan have also failed to achieve a balanced position between men and women in terms of legal interests. For this reason, a meeting was convened and gentlemen were invited to give legitimate business rights. Chen Lingyi reported that (1) Article 239 of the Criminal Law stipulates that only women have the responsibility to maintain chastity, and men are not subject to the same restrictions. To achieve equality between men and women, men and women should be subject to the same legal sanctions. Rights and obligations should be equal. Therefore, I advocate amending this article. (2) In the past, girls under the age of 16 were considered to be raped if they were defiled, because girls of 16 years old often have not fully developed. Now the Legislative Yuan has reduced the age to 14, which is detrimental to the health of women. Therefore, in order to seek the strength of the nation, this unreasonable provision should be amended and the original regulations should be maintained. Other examples, such as Articles 1117 and 1019 of the Civil Code, which state that wives cannot enjoy the ownership of their husbands' property, are even more unfair. The purpose of inviting you gentlemen to this meeting today is to hope that the opinion community will assist us in order to realize the goal of equality between men and women. Yang Zhihao delivered a speech, and the press answered. (The long speech is not recorded.) Then, discussions began and the following were passed: (1) Appeal to the Central Political Council to ask the Legislative Yuan to amend Article 239. (2) Send Liu Wang Liming, Wang Ruizhu, and Chen Lingyi to Beijing to petition the Central Government. The Women's Great Alliance will hold a joint meeting of various groups tomorrow to discuss.</p>
<p>The Female Students Association of the Shanghai University of Law and Politics issued the following telegram: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the Central Political Conference: It has been found that Article 256 of the current Criminal Law only punishes married women for adultery, but does not punish married men for adultery, which goes against the principle of equality between men and women. Therefore, the proposed amendment to the Criminal Law stipulates that 'anyone with a spouse who commits adultery shall be punished.' This provision is not only in line with the principle of equal punishment for men and women, but also in line with the purpose of correcting morals and encouraging customs. However, the legislators have other ideas and hastily passed 'married women who commit adultery with others shall be sentenced to imprisonment of up to one year, and their adulterers shall be punished in the same way' at the third reading. The news has caused widespread shock. There are many explanations for the legislative reasons, but in summary, 'if men commit adultery, they are guilty of crimes, then 200 million men in China, or 300 million, may be guilty of crimes.' If this is the reason, then this association believes that it is not possible. It is precisely because of the large number of people that they should be punished. Moreover, criminal policy lies in preventing the occurrence of crime and improving its viciousness. If crimes are not punished because there are too many offenders, then there are also many opium addicts, why are they punished? If it is said that opium addiction weakens the race and the country, so it is punished, then the harm of adultery to customs is no less than that of opium addiction. Now, let us admit that criminals are not punished because there are too many offenders. Then the same behavior should not be punished differently because of the difference between men and women. At this time of decadent customs, the proposal to 'punish adulterers' should be realized. The legislative committees should adhere to the teachings of the President and enact laws on equality between men and women, punishing 'those who commit adultery with a spouse.' Today, instead of doing this, they are reverting to laws under feudal consciousness, imposing unilateral obligations on women, and demanding so much of women. This provision not only violates the principle of equality under the law, but also reduces the spirit of the entire legislation. If the Legislative Yuan is not ordered to reconsider quickly, how can the party's prestige be maintained and justice be shown? In order to adhere to the teachings of the President, to uphold the principle of equality between men and women, and to support the constitutional government of the party's rule, this association cannot remain silent. Therefore, we sincerely request your departments (conferences) to order the Legislative Yuan to reconsider quickly and maintain the original proposal of the draft Criminal Law. With urgent anticipation, Shanghai University of Law and Politics Women's Association respectfully salutes."</p>
<h3>Gunshots Ring Out on Avenue Edward VII, Lottery Tickets Scattered All Over the Ground</h3>
<p>Robbers Panic and Abandon Loot</p>
<p>Money Returned to Rightful Owner</p>
<p>Wang Gengsheng, a partner of a certain money shop, carried a package of two-dollar bills from the shop at around 12:00 noon yesterday to another nearby money shop, totaling about 200 yuan. Unexpectedly, a thief caught a glimpse of it and had designs on it. He followed Wang relentlessly and waited until he reached the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Shandong Road. The two robbers immediately caught up with Wang, stopped him, and told him not to make a sound. They snatched the lottery tickets that Wang was carrying and fled. Seeing the robbers running away, Wang chased after them and shouted for help. At this time, the nearby patrol officer heard the alarm and quickly drew his gun and gave chase. Seeing the police officer chasing after them, the robbers panicked and drew their guns in a hurry, firing at the police officer. The police officer returned fire, and the passers-by scattered in panic. Seeing that the situation was not good, the robbers scattered the lottery tickets they had stolen on the road and took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The patrol officer picked up the tickets and reported the incident to the police station along with Wang Gengsheng. The police chief dispatched detectives to search in all directions and returned the stolen goods to the partner who signed for them.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of Miss Deng Liming's Case Against Kang Keling</h3>
<p>If Zhang Shouchun Does Not Surrender Again,</p>
<p>The Court Will Issue an Arrest Warrant</p>
<p>Zhang Shouchun, residing in Pudong, east of the Shanghai Military Camp on Dongji Factory Road in the Southern District, had an affair with Deng Liming, a female employee of the Kang Keling department of the Wing On Company, who is from Guangdong. After several amorous encounters, Deng became pregnant and is now five months along. Upon learning of Deng's pregnancy, Zhang abandoned her. Deng then engaged lawyer Jiang Yiping to negotiate, but Zhang harbored resentment. On the evening of the 20th of last month at 11:30 PM, Zhang approached Deng (residing at No. 55 Jingxiu Road, Southern District) as she left the Great Shanghai Cinema with Pan Xingfang, a woman residing at No. 6, Lane 563, Weihaiwei Road. At the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Ma Huo Road, Zhang slapped Deng twice, verbally abused her, and threatened her with a self-defense pistol. Deng reported this to the Chengdu Road Police Station, and a public prosecution was filed in the First Special Court under Articles 319 and 293 of the Criminal Code. A summons was issued once, but Zhang did not appear, and the hearing was rescheduled. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated that he had followed the court's summons to investigate at the Jiu Ji Lumber Company and was told by the accountant that the summons was received on Zhang's behalf. However, it was not mentioned that Zhang was not in Shanghai. Since he did not appear today, a warrant should be issued for his arrest. Zhang's lawyer then stated that Zhang was in Hong Kong and had not returned to Shanghai, so he could not attend court. Judge Huang ordered that the case be rescheduled for another hearing and that Zhang Shouchun should be detained. If he fails to appear at the next hearing, he will be wanted.</p>
<h3>Huang Huancheng, Accused of Bigamy, Surrenders</h3>
<p>Huang Claims Chen Jiying Has Been Married Three Times</p>
<p>The Judge Orders Huang to Post a 1,000 Yuan Guarantee</p>
<p>Huang Huancheng, a lawyer from Taixing, Jiangbei, met Chen Jiying, a young woman from Yixing, in December of last year. Admiring her beauty, he enlisted matchmakers and falsely claimed to be unmarried. Chen agreed to marry him. In September, when Huang's younger brother came from their hometown, Chen inquired about the family and discovered that Huang had already married in his hometown. When she tried to negotiate, Huang secretly left Shanghai, disappearing without a trace. Chen then filed a criminal self-accusation in the First Special District Local Court, accusing Huang of bigamy and abandonment. Huang Huancheng avoided appearing in court for both hearings, making it impossible to conduct the trial. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhou Zehan continued the summons. Huang, having heard that the court was considering detention, dared not continue to hide and surrendered with his defense lawyer. He first stated that after leaving Shanghai, he returned to his hometown and was unaware of Chen's accusations. He recently received a letter from his office and rushed to surrender himself. Secondly, he claimed that he and Chen Jiying began living together on March 1st, and although they signed a cohabitation agreement, they did not hold a wedding ceremony or banquet, and it was actually an act of taking her as a concubine. Furthermore, the plaintiff had already been married three times before. Her first marriage was to a Mr. Li who was once the magistrate of Yixing County, the second to Mr. Hu, the chief of the Ningbo Military Law Department, and the third to a Lu in Yixing. This cohabitation was the fourth marriage for Chen, so not only was she not a virgin, but she had already had a child with someone else. Judge Wu then summoned the matchmakers Wang Qingshan, Wang Chunyang, and Zhou Jingming for separate inquiries. Wang and the others all stated that they were asked by the defendant to act as matchmakers and that the defendant claimed to be marrying Chen as his wife. However, they were not present when the two began living together, so they did not know if a wedding ceremony was held. They would never have taken on such an introduction if they knew that the defendant already had a wife or knew that the plaintiff had been married before. Judge Wu stated that the defendant, being a lawyer, had committed such an unlawful act and could not be excused. He ordered that he post a 1,000 yuan guarantee, go out and reconcile quickly, or face rescheduling for a trial.</p>
<h3>Does the Case Against Pan Wenxia Have a Publicity Purpose?</h3>
<p>The First Special Court Deems It Suspicious</p>
<p>The Plaintiff is Summoned for Detailed Investigation</p>
<p>Zhu Ruifeng, the manager of the Meihua Film Company located on the fourth floor of No. 266 Beijing Road, previously accused Pan Wenxia, the female lead of the company's "Rose Song" film, of breaching the contract by going to the Shanghai Film Company to film during work hours. He engaged lawyer Tang Hao to sue Pan for breach of trust in the Criminal Court of the First Special District. The case was later settled, and Zhu withdrew the charges. The Special Court approved this and declared that the case would not be heard. This was reported in this newspaper. After the case occurred, there were many rumors circulating, and various tabloids reprinted that the lawsuit was for publicity purposes. Zhong Qing, the prosecutor of the Procuratorate of the First Special Court, investigated Zhu Ruifeng and lawyer Tang Hao, believing that they may be guilty of false accusation. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Zhong opened the Ninth Criminal Court for investigation. Tang Hao was unable to appear in court due to illness and sent lawyer Huang Zengjie to court to make a statement and submit an X-ray of Ye Fang as proof. Zhu Ruifeng and witnesses Pan Wenxia and Zhou Yinong all arrived on time. Pan Wenxia was summoned first and testified that she had a contract with Meihua Company with a monthly salary of 70 yuan. The working hours were from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and it was stipulated that she could not work elsewhere during work hours. On September 25th, she was invited by Zhou Yinong to Vienna for a fashion show, where the Shanghai Film Company filmed news footage. Later, on the 28th, Zhou again invited her to the Shanghai Film Company to film. She discussed this with Mr. Zhu, who did not agree, but Zhou insisted, saying it was not important. So, she went, with the time being from 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM. The court then inquired whether this lawsuit was real or fake or whether the court was being used as a publicity agency. Pan replied that it was completely real. Later, her uncle learned about this in the newspaper in Nanjing and rushed to Shanghai to mediate and apologize, and Mr. Zhu withdrew the charges. The court then showed her the tabloids. After reading them, Pan replied that although the newspapers reported it that way, it was not true. Zhou Yinong was then summoned and testified about the circumstances of inviting Pan to perform at the fashion show. Zhu Ruifeng testified that he had indeed allowed Zhou Yinong to invite Pan Wenxia to perform in the fashion show. However, he did not allow her to film at the Shanghai Film Company. He argued with Zhou about this because it was a significant loss for Meihua Company, so he sued in court. He stated that he had engaged Tang Hao as his lawyer and that he had advocated for the accusation of breach of trust. The court then asked if there was another purpose. He replied that there was no purpose at all. The court asked, "The newspapers all say there is a purpose." He replied, "I cannot prevent the newspapers from publishing, but there is no other purpose." He added that the withdrawal of the charges was because Pan's uncle intervened and someone had told Pan not to work for the company again after the lawsuit. However, Pan did not listen to them and continued to work for the company, so he forgave her and did not investigate further. Prosecutor Zhong said that further investigation was necessary and ordered Zhu Ruifeng to pay a 600 yuan bail and dismissed Pan Wenxia and Zhou Yinong.</p>
<h3>Fire on Xinji Bang Road Destroys More Than Twenty Buildings</h3>
<p>Losses Reach Over Ten Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The two-story shops and bungalows near the intersection of Xinji Bang Road and Tangshan Road in Hongkou, totaling about forty or fifty buildings, were rented to small business owners to open shops, while the rest were inhabited by poor people. Yesterday around noon, a fire suddenly broke out in the buildings. White smoke billowed, and flames soared into the sky. In addition, the weather was dry, causing the fire to spread even faster. Within an hour, more than twenty buildings were affected. Fortunately, the Hongkou Fire Brigade received the alarm and rushed to extinguish the fire, which was eventually put out. The fire destroyed Hongfa Pawnshop, Yanxin Hardware Store, Shifa Carriage Shop, Zhang Liji Machinery Shop, Baofengyong Copper Workshop, Gu Renji Copper Workshop, Chen Wanxing Wood Workshop, Yu Youji Bellows Shop, Wang Qiajian Hairdressing Shop, and more than ten poor people's residences. The cause of the fire is still unknown. However, firefighters inspecting the scene afterwards discovered the bodies of a child and a woman. It was reported that the woman was an old lady who had paralysis and was unable to move, resulting in her being burned to death. The total losses are estimated to be over ten thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Adultery with a Friend's Wife</h3>
<p>Shi Fengchun Befriended the Wrong Person</p>
<p>Wang Nengfei is Too Outrageous</p>
<p>Shi Fengchun, a native of Haimen, Jiangsu, is 31 years old. He runs a cake and dumpling shop at No. 359 Julai Road in the French Concession. His wife, Li, is 24 years old and also lives in the shop. Shi also has a branch shop on Aivenyi Road in the British Concession, so he goes to both shops every day to handle business and always returns to the old shop late at night to sleep. Wang Nengfei, a fellow townsman of Shi, is 30 years old and used to work as a driver. Recently, he has been unemployed and has been lodging in Shi's old shop. He sees Shi's wife, Li, every day. Seeing that she is somewhat pretty, he had the idea of ​​spending the night with her in her lonely state, and he used seductive means. Li was also flirtatious, so he gained entry. He would often take advantage of Shi's absence and meet with her in the upstairs room of the shop, not avoiding the eyes and ears of the shop assistants. Around 10:00 PM on the 7th, Shi finished his business at the new shop and returned to the old shop. When he entered the room to sleep, he saw Wang Nengfei sleeping in bed, necking with his wife. He became enraged and turned around, locked the door from the outside, and ran to the French Police Station to report. The head constable sent detective Xue Youlin to arrest Wang and Shi and take them to the police station. According to Li's confession, she had committed adultery with Wang twice. Wang confessed that Shi Fengchun had previously borrowed 100 yuan from him and asked Li to call him upstairs. She said that her husband knew about the affair. The head constable ordered them to be detained. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District. Judge Sun Pengxian proposed the case, and the police lawyer Chen Ming stated the case, prosecuting them for the crime of disrupting the family. The court verified the warrant and questioned the two defendants, who both confessed to adultery. The judge ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the 13th, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sends Another Letter to the Public Works Department to Cancel One-Way Traffic on Hankou Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, we received a letter on the 8th of this month from the Silk and Satin Trade Association stating that Hankou Road, from Henan Road in the east to Fujian Road in the west, has traditionally been the gathering place for silk shops, with bustling markets and closely arranged shops, comparable to the central section of Nanjing Road. Since the Public Works Department implemented one-way traffic, vehicles have been restricted, and pedestrians have found it difficult, resulting in a gradual decline in business for various shops. Some have closed due to their inability to sustain themselves, while others have moved due to their inability to leave. Old Jie Lun and Ma Yuanfeng, located west of Zhoujin Lane along the road, have already moved for this reason, which is clear evidence. Our Chamber's office is located at No. 460 Hankou Road, and for the past two years, we have witnessed the stagnation and changes in the commercial situation on the road due to the one-way traffic. In addition to sending a letter requesting cancellation, we are now sending another letter to you, respectfully requesting that you forward it to the Public Works Department and immediately cancel the one-way traffic on Hankou Road to restore the former appearance of the commercial market."

<h3>Pan Hongsheng's Funeral Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Students and Scouts from All Schools Will Participate</p>
<p>The British Public Works Department Has Agreed to Issue a Funeral Permit</p>
<p>The funeral of patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng has been scheduled for 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 11th). Participants from all walks of life are increasingly enthusiastic. The issue of the funeral road permit has been properly negotiated with the Public Works Department through Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing and others. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Permission to Issue Road Permit The Public Works Department's Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, and the secretary of the Taxpayers' Association, Tao Leqin, etc., visited the director of the Public Works Department, Jones, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the request of representatives from various groups, requesting that he issue a funeral permit for martyr Pan. Jones personally received them. Yu and others first stated the reasons for requesting the issuance of the permit. After listening, Jones saw that the representatives' words were very sincere and immediately agreed to issue the permit. The representatives achieved their goal and returned. They also learned that the French Concession had not yet received a permit, and they requested that the Chinese Directors of the French Concession, Du Yuesheng, Cheng Zhisun, Shang Mujiang, and Qu Zhenhua, go to negotiate this morning, so there should be no problems. According to news from the Public Works Department's Intelligence Office, yesterday's newspaper reported that Pan Hongsheng's funeral was planned to pass through the Public Concession, but the Public Concession authorities refused to issue a permit. This is not consistent with the facts. The person in charge of the funeral has not yet submitted a feasible plan to the Public Works Department for the funeral procession to pass through the Public Concession. The route they proposed is impossible. As for the Public Works Department, it has not necessarily refused to issue a permit.</p>
<p>Notice of Mourning The Committee to Assist Patriotic Martyrs sent a notice to various groups yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, the 11th of this month is the date of the funeral of patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng. All citizens should show their expression. It has been decided through a meeting that the entire city will fly flags at half-mast for one day to show mourning and remembrance. We are sending you this letter to inform you and request that you check and instruct your members to comply."</p>
<p>Letter to Various Schools The funeral office sent a letter to various schools in the city yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, patriotic youth martyr Pan Hongsheng sacrificed himself for the country. His ambition is commendable, and his situation is pitiable. We have initiated a funeral to handle the aftermath and have been approved to hold the funeral at noon on November 11th, from the Chinese Concession to the Xijin Cemetery. We request that all students and Scouts from your school participate in carrying the coffin to show respect for the patriotic martyr's courage and enthusiasm during his lifetime and to encourage the patriotism of our compatriots. We trust that your school will express sympathy."</p>

<h3>Gunfire at Amusement Venue Hits Prostitute</h3>
<p>Did Chen Xin Fire the Gun Because He Was Drunk?</p>
<p>Lu Aiying's Testimony Also Differs Inconsistently</p>
<p>Chen Xin, a native of this county, is 34 years old and lives at No. 1 Yida Lane, Jumen Road, Southern District. He works as a sales director at Yifeng Enamel Factory and has a self-defense pistol with the number 321, for which he has licenses in the British, French, and Chinese concessions. Chen has a penchant for womanizing and often visits brothels and seeks pleasure. Recently, he met Lu Aiying (also known as Laoqi), a prostitute from Suzhou, 21 years old, at the Lihua brothel on Guangxi Road. Chen often called Lu for company, so their relationship was quite deep. On the 5th of this month, Chen even sponsored Lu at the Lihua brothel. At that time, Chen intended to have intercourse with Lu, but because Lu was ill, he was unable to achieve his goal. The next day, Chen reserved room 322 at the Oriental Hotel and invited Lu to come, hoping to achieve his goal. However, because Lu's illness had not yet healed, it did not materialize. On the evening of the 7th, Chen reserved room 357 at the Oriental Hotel and then went to the Lihua brothel to invite Lu to come to the Oriental Hotel together. Upon arriving at the room, Chen reiterated his request, and Lu did not refuse, so a physical relationship occurred.</p>
<p>After their first encounter, they parted ways around 10:00 PM. Last night, Liu Zejing hosted guests at the Huanqiu Hong brothel in Xinhui Le Lane, Fuzhou Road, and Chen was among those invited. Around 10:00 PM, Chen called Lu with a bureau ticket, and Lu, accompanied by another prostitute Zhang Sujuan (from Suzhou, 18 years old), went in response to the summons. Later, Zhang returned first, while Lu accompanied Chen to drink. It was almost 11:45 PM when Chen and Lu left the host and went to the Lihua brothel together. Unexpectedly, at 12:03 AM, Chen suddenly took out his self-defense pistol and fired a shot, hitting prostitute Zhang Sujuan in the right leg, causing profuse bleeding. The report was made to the police, and Chinese detective Zhao Ziren, detective Bao Cui Yulou, and Chinese police officer No. 2222 from the Old Gate Police Station went to arrest Chen. The injured person was immediately transported to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Chen was sent to the First Criminal Court, presided over by Judge Qian Hongye, for questioning. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case, saying that the defendant appeared to be drunk at the time and that the hospital had confirmed that he was drunk. He was being prosecuted for attempted murder under Article 282, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, and requested that he be punished according to the law. Zhang Sujuan, who was injured, was unable to appear in court today because of her injuries. Lu Aiying then stated that the defendant appeared drunk after she left the Huanqiu Hong brothel with him, uttering drunken words. After arriving at her brothel, he was still talking nonsense loudly. She stopped him, but the defendant took out a pistol. She wanted to stop him, but before she could, the bullet was fired, hitting Zhang's leg. However, she denied having a physical relationship with Chen, saying that the defendant had repeatedly wanted to have intercourse with her, but she had refused on the pretext of illness. She added that the defendant had consumed one glass of whiskey and a lot of wine at the Huanqiu Hong. Zhang Zhushi and Ru Yinshi, servants of the Lihua brothel, also testified, saying that they were working at the time and did not see how the gunfire occurred. Upon questioning, Chen Xin confessed that on the 5th, after paying back the wine, on the 7th, Lu ordered him to reserve room 357 at the Oriental Hotel, where they had a relationship and separated after 10:00 PM. That room was then occupied by his friend Pan Deqing, the owner of the Tianle Tea Garden in the Sun Temple. Yesterday, after leaving the Huanqiu Hong, Lu insisted on inviting him to her place. Unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived, more than ten gangsters surrounded him, demanding 300 yuan and pointing a gun at him. He had no choice but to take out his gun and fire it at the ground. Judge Qian Hongye then inquired whether he fired the gun with a clear purpose and was not drunk. Chen replied yes, but then immediately changed his statement, saying that he was somewhat drunk at the time. Judge Qian also asked prostitute Lu whether a physical relationship had occurred. Lu also admitted directly, saying that she was forced to comply. The court ordered that the case be rescheduled for one week because further investigation was needed. Chen's lawyer Zhang Ding requested bail, but it was denied, and he was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Feng Deqian's Passion Murder Case Continued Yesterday: Killer Wang Nengxiang</h3>
<p>Wang Claims That He and Huang Mao Sometimes Slept on a Small Boat</p>
<p>Final Argument in the Case Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 15th</p>
<p>The love triangle involving film star Li Minghui, which caused a sensation in society, resulted in a tragic murder. Zheng Guoyou, due to Feng Deqian stealing his lover Li Minghui, became jealous and instructed the coachman Liu Xing (also known as A Liu) to hire a murderer to kill Feng. Liu negotiated with Xu Yongzhen, promising 2,000 yuan after the matter was completed. Xu then negotiated with Wang Nengxiang. On March 24, 1932, at around 8:00 PM, Feng Deqian was shot and killed on Shanguang Road in Hong Kong. Wang Nengxiang was arrested in Shanghai. Due to the issue of jurisdiction, the First Special District Court transferred the case to the Local Court for repeated trials without a conclusion. The case was adjourned awaiting the summons of witnesses. This was reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Sun Jikang specially opened the Fifth Court for a continued trial. First, witness Huang Shaotang testified that he was a carpenter at the Dadong Company in Guangzhou in 1932. Wang Nengxiang and he were friends. Wang often came to Guangzhou to solicit business, so he came and went from time to time, sometimes staying for a month or only two or three days, without a fixed pattern. He was not sure whether Wang Nengxiang had been to Guangzhou in February of that year. He stayed in the Dadong factory every night and did not sleep on a small boat with Wang Nengxiang. As for Mao Er, he also did not live with them. Wang Nengxiang then stated that he went to Guangzhou around the 10th of February in 1932 to solicit business and went to Hong Kong on the 2nd of March. When he was in Guangzhou, he slept with Huang Shaotang and Mao Er in the Dadong factory or on a small boat every day. After obtaining the statements, the judge ordered the beginning of the arguments. The lawyer Pan Xi, hired by the defendant, stated that Wang Nengxiang confessed to going to Guangzhou to solicit business, and Huang Shaotang also said that Wang went to solicit business and that Huang said that Wang came and went often, which was the same as Wang Nengxiang's confession. Huang Shaotang was a person without knowledge. He had been summoned several times before but did not come. He was deeply afraid of being implicated, so he did not dare to say that he had slept with Wang Nengxiang on a small boat. In short, Wang Nengxiang was falsely accused and requested that he be declared innocent. The judge then ordered that the final arguments be concluded and that the verdict be announced at 1:00 PM on the 15th of this month. Wang Nengxiang was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Another New Extortion Case in the Wang Yigong Case</h3>
<p>The Extortionist is the Husband of Luo Yulan</p>
<p>The Investigator of Tianyunlou is also Involved</p>
<p>Wang Yigong, a local resident currently residing at No. 20, Meilefang, Huanlong Road, French Concession, manager of the New China Advertising Company, founder of the New China Daily, and head of the advertising department of Wing On Company, was previously sued in the Second Special District Court by Luo Yulan, a young woman from Changzhou residing at No. 25, Juqing Lane, Xinzha Road, through lawyer Gao Danhua for criminal self-accusation of offenses against public morals, malicious abandonment, and embezzlement. After Judge Li Changnian repeatedly summoned and questioned him, he was ordered to reschedule the hearing for the 13th of this month to summon the plaintiff Luo Yulan and witness Zhong Dexin to investigate the details. These events have been reported in previous issues. Unexpectedly, during the brewing of the case and before the court had summoned him, Wang Yigong suddenly received a threatening letter purportedly from the "National Salvation Comrades Group," stating that due to financial difficulties, they were borrowing 5,000 silver dollars. This letter was intercepted by the Shanghai Postal Inspection Office after being received by the post office, which determined it to be a threatening letter. Therefore, the post office sent the letter to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for investigation. The police bureau, noting that the recipient's address on the letter was Huanlong Road, within the jurisdiction of the French Concession, forwarded the letter to the Central Police Station of the French Concession. The police station dispatched a detective on the 19th of last month to notify Wang Yigong. The letter, in addition to requesting a loan of 5,000 silver dollars, requested him to wait at the back door of the French Park at 6:00 AM on the 21st, where someone holding a black leather wine bottle would approach him to negotiate. Wang ignored this. On the 25th of the same month, he received a second letter, its tone blaming Wang for lacking sincerity and instructing him to paste six large black characters, "Emperor of Heaven, Emperor of Earth," on red paper at the entrance of the lane on Sunday morning to show his sincerity for negotiation, after which another letter would be sent to arrange the date and location for negotiation. For the third time, Wang received a similar letter on the 6th of this month, requesting him to negotiate at 3:00 PM the following day at the telegraph pole opposite Bansong Garden in the South City, with the representative to be dressed in a black long gown and carrying an umbrella as a sign, and to place the banknotes inside a shoebox. Wang Yigong consistently ignored these three threatening letters. Until the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 8th), a 31-year-old man named Sang Zhenbang, claiming to be a native of Changshu and the divorced husband of Luo Yulan, rushed to Wing On Company's Tianyunlou to find Wang Yigong. After the two met, Sang claimed that he had a change of heart and that "they" (referring to Luo Yulan and Zhong Dexin) had written the letters to extort 5,000 yuan, with 500 yuan to be given to him upon receipt, which he did not want. He came today specifically to explain the matter and advise Wang to pay 4,000 yuan to settle the matter. Upon hearing this, Wang feigned agreement and stalled for time, inviting Sang to dinner at a certain restaurant on West Xinxiao Street in the French Concession, while secretly sending someone to report to the French police station. Sang, unaware of the plan, thought Wang had fully agreed and that the matter could be resolved with money, so he happily accompanied Wang. When they arrived in front of the Sanhe Building restaurant on West Xinxiao Street in the French Concession, the French police station, having been informed, had Inspector-General Jin Jiulin of the Special Agency, along with detectives Qian Yumin, Yang Yilong, Zhou Binglong, and patrol officer Bu Zhenglong, waiting there. Seeing Sang and Wang approaching, they immediately arrested Sang and took him to the French police station. According to Sang's confession, he was instructed by Zhong Dexin, an investigator from Tianyunlou, Wing On Company, who was from Ningbo, to write the threatening letters. The plan was jointly conceived by Wang Yingzhou, a clerk from Tianyunlou's accounting department, and with the consent of lawyer Gao Danhua. The detectives then, together with detectives from the Old Gate Police Station, went to Wing On Company and arrested Zhong Dexin (31 years old, residing at No. 1, Linping Road, in the Chinese territory of Hongkou), bringing him in for questioning. Zhong denied any conspiracy. The police chief ordered him to be detained. At 3:00 PM yesterday, they were escorted to the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Yang Ding and Clerk Zheng Rong presided over the hearing. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuang of the police station presented the case, stating briefly that the defendants were arrested for extortion and that the police station's investigation was not yet complete, requesting a five-day postponement and temporary detention of the defendants until the case was clarified and prosecuted. The court, after reviewing the report and briefly questioning the defendants, ordered a postponement to the 13th for further questioning, and the defendants were returned to custody. At that time, Sang Zhenbang claimed that he was wronged and that his ex-wife Luo Yulan had told him in Changshu to come to Shanghai only three or two days ago. The court ordered him to wait until the next hearing to speak. The bailiffs then took the two defendants away and returned them to the police station to await investigation. From this, it can be seen that the truth of Wang Yigong's accusation is fictitious and gradually becoming clear. The truth will come to light at the next hearing.</p>

<h3>Two Red Pill Factories Seized on Gordon Road</h3>
<p>Named Nanyang Company and Dacheng Company</p>
<p>A Large Number of Red Pills and Machines Seized</p>
<p>Zhu Hanbo, a Chinese detective chief of the Gordon Road Police Station, received a tip from an informant the night before last that someone was privately setting up red pill manufacturing plants at No. 709 Gordon Road and No. 49, Hezhong Lane, No. 685 Gordon Road, named Nanyang Company and Dacheng Company, secretly selling them at a price of five yuan per bag of 1,000 pills. He dispatched detectives to investigate and confirmed the information. The detectives then reported to the First Special Court the morning before yesterday and obtained a search warrant. Accompanied by Western detective Wit, detective Zhao Qingkui, and others, they first went to the kitchen of the cigarette paper store at No. 709 Gordon Road and arrested Zhang Youjun, a native of Guangzhou. They seized eight bags of red pills (1,000 pills per bag), two machines, 193 cloth bags, 35 paper bags, and one sieve. According to Zhang's confession, he lived at No. 49, Lane 685. The detectives then went to Zhang's home to search and seized more red pill equipment and paper bags. Based on Zhang's confession, they went to the Yong'an Hotel at No. 104 Shunde Road and arrested his accomplices Zhou Jinshan, a native of Shaoxing, his wife Zhou Wangshi, and their seven-year-old daughter Zhou Axing. All were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station presented the case, stating that the main culprit was still at large, so he requested a postponement. However, he prosecuted the three defendants in this case in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Under questioning, Zhang Youjun confessed that the red pill business was a collaboration between him and two fugitives named Lin and Wang, with a capital of 100 yuan. To date, they had produced 100,000 pills in total, totaling 100 bags, and sold them for 500 yuan. After deducting all expenses, the profits were divided equally among the three of them. Recently, Lin and Wang had a disagreement with him and left. He was deeply afraid of accidents, so he temporarily deposited the red pills and equipment at the home of his friend Zhou Jinshan. He was unaware of the Zhou couple's involvement. Zhou Jinshan and Zhou Wangshi both denied involvement and denied manufacturing red pills. However, the seven-year-old daughter Zhou Axing testified that the Zhou couple were her uncle and aunt, and that her biological parents were in Chang'an Township. She had seen her uncle and aunt helping Zhang Youjun knead and make red pills at Zhang Youjun's home on weekdays. After verifying the confessions, Judge Wu Tingqi ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody separately and postponed the hearing for seven days. Zhou Axing was temporarily detained at the Jiliang Institute, pending a letter to her parents to come and claim her.</p>

<h3>All Group Championships in the Zhongxiao Joint Sports Meet on the Second Day Depend on Today</h3>
<p>Wuben and Huadong Decide the Victory in Group A for Women</p>
<p>No Problem for Patriotic Girls' High School in Group B for Women</p>
<p>Victory or Defeat for Men's Group A and B Depends on Today</p>
<p>A Total of Eleven Previous Records Broken in Two Days</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Shanghai Third Middle School Joint Sports Meet. The number of spectators still exceeded 10,000. More than 300 Boy Scouts from Guanghua High School and Private Shanghai High School maintained order, and the situation was good. Today is the most crucial day for the men's groups. There are still two track events and one field event left in the women's groups. Who will win the championship will be decided this afternoon. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Situation of Each School</p>
<p>The track and field events in the men's group are all undecided. Private Shanghai High School and Yuqing Middle School have not yet shown their true colors, and it is difficult to determine the outcome. Although Wuben is three points ahead of Huadong in the women's Group A, Huadong has more athletes in the 100-meter and 200-meter events today. Judging from yesterday's situation, Wuben should be defeated. As for the javelin event, Zhang Pingfu of Huadong has a great hope of winning the championship. Therefore, Huadong's hope of winning the Group A championship is still very strong. There is no problem for Aiguo High School to win the Group B championship. The women's sports school was originally a battle between the sisters of Southeast and Liangjiang. Southeast has a strong force and will definitely overwhelm Liangjiang, but the sports school is only performing and does not count scores.</p>

<p>Group Performances</p>
<p>Yesterday, the various schools put on a total of fifteen group performances. The single saber performance by Private Shangzhong and the Chinese martial arts by Kaiming Middle School both demonstrated skill and inspired a martial spirit. The calisthenics by East China Women's Middle School and the flexibility exercises by Daozhong Women's Middle School had neat, beautiful movements and lively, delightful postures. The kindergarten teaching material performance by the Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School was thought-provoking and perfectly appropriate. Other performances, such as the round formation exercises by Huiqun Women's Middle School, the Cantonese-style calisthenics by Minzhi Middle School, the calisthenics by North City Middle School, and the colored flag exercises by Minsheng Middle School, were also quite neat and skilled, earning much praise.</p>

<p>Track and Field Observations</p>
<p>Xiao Jiangqing Sick with Illness</p>
<p>Jiang Qing of Guanghua Affiliated Middle School attended the first day of the meet, but was not seen yesterday. It is said that he took sick leave. Guanghua will no longer be able to make inquiries in the 800 meters. What a pity.</p>
<p>Chen Mingliang Turns Back to Look Three Times</p>
<p>During the 200-meter preliminary race, Chen Mingliang turned back to look three times near the finish line, affecting his performance, resulting in a time of only 25.4 seconds, not as good as Ye Haitao. A word to Mr. Chen: it is best not to look back in the future.</p>
<p>Li Songnian Disqualified</p>
<p>Originally, in the Men's Group A 100 meters, after Dong Yinchu did not participate, Li Songnian of Great China University could have stood out. Unexpectedly, during yesterday's semi-final race, he was disqualified for a false start. All of the people from Great China University regretted it.</p>
<p>Jin Zhongkang Hindered Midway</p>
<p>The 1500 meters was the most exciting event yesterday. In the first heat, Jin Zhongkang was leading all the way, with Gu Binghou following closely behind. In the last lap, Jin Zhongkang suddenly fell, and Gu Binghou overtook him by 20 meters. Jin immediately turned over and got back on track. He was still overtaken in the last 20 meters. Rare, rare.</p>
<p>Miss Fang's Previous Efforts Wasted</p>
<p>Fang Ruifang of Aikun Women's Middle School had the best time in the 50 meters and had a great chance of winning the championship. Unexpectedly, she was penalized for a false start in the final, and her previous efforts were wasted. Miss Fang almost cried.</p>
<p>Sand Field Inspection</p>
<p>Men's High Jump Champion: Zhang Quan</p>
<p>Zhang Quan of Pudong was able to retain the title in the Men's Group A high jump, winning first place with 1.66 meters. Although the result was not great, his high jump form was very good. Zhang Shenru of Mullen is also a promising talent.</p>
<p>Shi Ouqing Did Not Complete Her Full Potential</p>
<p>Shi Ouqing of East China has a normal high jump record of 1.302 meters. Yesterday, when she jumped 1.225 meters, she stopped the competition because Xu Jingyan of Minli had already been defeated, and the championship was already decided. As a result, she did not jump her best record.</p>
<p>Zhang Pingfu Flustered On the Field</p>
<p>Zhang Pingfu's shot put and javelin skills were among the best in Women's Group A. Yesterday, her performance was several meters worse than usual, resulting in being eliminated. It is hoped that she will do better in today's javelin event.</p>
<p>Miss Guan Has a Stout Figure and Good Health</p>
<p>Guan Yanjiao of Aiguo is a leader in the shot put and javelin in Women's Group B. Yesterday, she lived up to expectations in the shot put final and won first place. Miss Guan's body is stouter than before, and her physical strength has also increased.</p>

<p>Meeting Anecdotes</p>
<p>Women's Physical Education High Jump Explored in the Dark</p>
<p>Yesterday, the competition was completed, and it was so dark that one could not see one's fingers. Unexpectedly, the women's physical education school high jump final had not been completed and was still being explored in the dark. The referee recorded the results, lighting a match to write them down. The situation was such that the outcome was entirely determined by luck. Although the physical education school belonged to the performance category, it should not have been treated so carelessly. Jumping high in the dark can also be described as a novel approach.</p>
<p>The Spectacle of Athletes Weighing In Was Miserable</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the competition, and it was already the final stage. The weighing-in area was bustling with activity. Hu Zongfan complained endlessly. When each athlete went through the ordeal of weighing in, most of them reduced their food intake, bared their heads and washed their feet, leaving only a pair of shorts. Their shivering state was a miserable sight. Shao Rugan saw it and could not help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>Another World Outside the Track and Field</p>
<p>The number of visitors yesterday was less than on the first day. More than 300 Boy Scouts were dispatched by the Boy Scouts Council to maintain order at the meeting. However, outside the track and field, it was another world, with rows of stalls and thriving businesses, creating a lively scene.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Students Cheered and Shouted</p>
<p>Due to its location, Jiaotong University specially opened the side of the commander's platform as a seating area for the school's students. Dressed in yellow uniforms, they filled the stands. Whenever they saw track and field athletes listed among the top contenders, they shouted and cheered.</p>
<p>Commander Jiang Takes Leave Today</p>
<p>Track and field starter Jiang Xiangqing was unable to attend the meeting due to personal reasons. Shen Guoquan was also unable to be present to serve because he was leading Jiaotong University students on a trip to Hangzhou. Therefore, the position of starter has been agreed upon by the conference authorities and Mr. Jiang, and Mr. Dong Chengkang will serve as his agent today.</p>
<p>Kindergarten Performance Was Thought-Provoking</p>
<p>Among yesterday's group performances, the kindergarten teaching material performance by the students of the Private Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School was the most interesting. The movements were lovely, the singing was melodious, and the dancing was both captivating and thought-provoking.</p>

<h3>Cheng Dengke Lectures at the East Asia Physical Education College Yesterday</h3>
<p>The East Asia Physical Education College in Lujiawan, Shanghai, has always emphasized academic aspects of physical education. Mr. Cheng Dengke, a great sports figure in China, was originally a teacher at the school before studying in Germany. After returning to China, he took charge of the Physical Education Department of Central University. He came to Shanghai a few days ago for business, and Chen Mengyu, the president of the school, earnestly invited Mr. Cheng to give a lecture at the school. Mr. Cheng agreed, and yesterday morning, Jiang Lianggui, a teacher at the school, welcomed him to the school. The lecture began at ten o'clock. The explanation of the improvement methods of China's sports administrative organization was very detailed.</p>
<h3>Complete Account of the Anhui Primary and Secondary School Joint Sports Meet</h3>
<p>(Anqing Correspondent) The fifth Anhui Provincial Primary and Secondary School Joint Sports Meet was held in the provincial capital's public sports field for four consecutive days, starting on November 2. The 2nd and 3rd were for primary school competitions, and the 4th and 5th were for secondary school competitions. A brief account of the events is given below:</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 8:00 AM on the 2nd. The participants included 37 units of primary and secondary schools, 624 male and female athletes in track and field events, more than 9,000 athletes in primary and secondary school group exercises, more than 100 officials of the conference and representatives from all walks of life. Many party and government authorities also attended. Vice Chairman Yang Lian presided over the meeting. After Yang's speech, Honorary Chairman Wang Yinchuan, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, delivered a speech, and then the procession went around the field for a week, starting the sports meet. During the sports meet, track and field events and group performances were held simultaneously. On this day, only the finals of the 100-meter race were held, and the rest were preliminary races. There were shot put, high jump, standing long jump, and other field events. The chief referee was Cheng Dengke. The group performances were quite wonderful.</p>
<p>The competition continued on the morning of the 3rd, and the number of visitors was greater than on the 2nd. Today was the last day for the primary school group. All track and field events were completely finalized. The results of each event exceeded the records of previous sessions. According to the refereeing results, Huang Jia Shi Primary School won first place in the boys' group with 30 points, and Dengyunpo Primary School won first place in the girls' group with 37 points.</p>
<p>The 4th was the start day of the secondary school group. Except for the finals of the women's 50-meter race, the women's 80-meter low hurdles, and the men's 800-meter race, all other track races were preliminary rounds. There were shot put, high jump, discus, and other field finals. During the competition, group performances and drills were also held simultaneously. The weather turned warmer today, and the audience was very crowded. After the various programs were completed in the afternoon, party, government, and military authorities also participated in the walking race, including Wang Yinchuan, Liang Xianda, Yang Lian, Cao Shaoying, Xiong Zhengping, and Li Zuqing. As a result, Xiong Zhengping won first place. Xiong is the commander of the 115th Division.</p>
<p>The 5th was the last day of the conference. It was cloudy and drizzling, but the competition did not stop. All track and field events were completely concluded. According to the refereeing results, Senior High School won first place in the boys' group with 48 points, and Girls' Vocational School won first place in the girls' group with 45 points. Due to the rain, the results were mediocre. The closing ceremony was held at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>The cost of this sports meet was very low, which was more economical than previous sessions. It is commendable. The results were not very special due to the impact of the rain, but this should not be taken to mean that there was no progress.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Radio Weekly</p>
<h3>The Construction Principle of New Automatic Switches and Regulators</h3>
<p>— Song Jianqin</p>
<p>The United States recently invented a radio equipped with a new automatic switch and automatic regulator, which is extremely convenient to use. If the adjustment dial is pre-arranged, the programs of the whole day can be sung on time, which is very wonderful. This radio is equipped with automatic volume control, so the volume of each radio station is the same. Now, the construction principle of it is described in detail as follows:</p>
<p>In the figure, W is a small electric clock, and its face is equipped with a special adjustment dial B. When B rotates for one week, it takes twelve hours. There are forty-eight slots around the dial. Each slot is clamped with a slider D. The slider can be adjusted up and down at will for adjustment. R is the knob for adjusting the time of the B dial, and K is the copper sheet installed on the insulator I, arranged in a straight line inside the B dial, about one point apart. One end of each sheet is connected to the line nails on the P dial with a wire.</p>
<p>The P dial is made of Bakelite. The outside of the dial is glued with two semi-circular metal sheets XZ. Bakelite O is used between the two sheets as their insulator. The width of O is about one point. 12345 are all line nails installed on the insulating Bakelite board. The position of this line nail can be moved. When it is moved to the destination, it can be tightened. The structure of one end is like a fountain pen nib, touching the metal sheet of P.</p>
<p>When B turns to six o'clock fifteen minutes, D is suitable to touch KI. At that time, the current flows from the small square shed TI to the X sheet, and then is guided by the line nail I to KI and to the D key. Because B and W are made of metal, the current is transmitted from the wire 6 to the brush of the small motor M. It is returned to the square shed by his brush to form a complex circuit, and the alternating current circulates back and forth in this circuit. Because the current passes through the rotor in the motor, A rotates to the right. The small gear on the motor continues to transmit from small to large to the gear of the three-gang capacitor. The axis slowly rotates to the right. Because P and the three-gang capacitor are on the same axis, they also rotate at the same time. When the insulating line O turns to the contact point of the line nail I, the current is cut off, and the motor also stops. (According to the motor, there is inertia when it stops, because it is transmitted to the axis, the change is very small, there is no problem.) The capacitor also stops at the same time. If the capacitor is at the frequency of a certain radio station in this degree, the radio can receive the music of a certain radio station.</p>
<p>If the electric clock goes to seven o'clock, the slider D touches K3. At that time, the line nail 3 is suitable to touch the Y sheet. Because the coil of the square shed connected to the Y sheet is opposite to X, the motor turns to the left. Its whole effect is the same as before, but the direction is opposite.</p>
<p>All in all. When the wire nails through which current passes touch the X sheet, the wheel axle finally rotates to the left until O is in contact with this wire nail, and it stops. If it touches the Y sheet. Its direction is suitable for the opposite of the previous one. Its movement is the same as before.</p>
<p>Also, when TP points to seven o'clock fifteen minutes. D is in contact with K5, P disk rotates to the right, when O is about to be in contact with line nail 5, (that is, when the capacitor is nearly 1500 kHz.) The horizontal handle Q on the shaft will open the power switch S of the radio, and the radio stops working, and wait for C to be in contact with line nail 5, the motor will also stop, at this time, the power supply does not need to be unplugged! The current consumed in the machine is very small, but the electromagnet G in the electric clock and a little current pass through the mother magnetic coil of the small square shed and the motor.</p>
<p>When the radio starts automatically, as soon as the axis rotates, Q will close S, and the filaments in the machine will light up. When O reaches the destination, the music immediately enters.</p>
<p>The above is just the use of automatic switch and adjustment. If you want to listen to other temporary programs. That's also very convenient. Just push the N knob in and rotate it. Because when N is pushed in. Push the iron bar H. More power is transmitted from J to L. The gears on the shaft are pushed out by L and disengaged from the U wheel. (If there is no such device, Z is not easy to rotate, because the gears on the shaft are connected to the gear set Z, and they transmit force to the motor on each other, resulting in extremely large resistance). Therefore, rotation is also very easy. If you let go of N, the spring inside will automatically eject N, and the gears on the shaft will return to their original position by the spring V.</p>
<p>In order to be easy to identify, the wires 1,2,3,4,5 are usually distinguished by red, yellow, blue, green, and white, and the B disk is also painted in the same color, so the circuit is clearer.</p>
<p>As for the procedure of pre-adjusting a certain line nail to the wavelength of a certain radio station, it is also very simple. You can push N to adjust to the wavelength of a certain radio station, or after receiving the music of a certain radio station, the O line of the P dial behind the machine is suitable in a certain position. Then move the nearby wire nail to O and tighten it. Then this wire nail can receive the music of a certain radio station.</p>
<h3>Coupling Circuit for High-Frequency Amplification</h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>The coupling methods of ordinary high-frequency amplification circuits can be divided into the following three types:</p>
<p>(1) Resistance coupling method,</p>
<p>(2) Transformer coupling method,</p>
<p>(3) Hybrid resistance coupling method.</p>
<p>Now, let's briefly describe them separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Resistance Coupling Method As shown in Figure 1, the advantage of this type of coupling method is that it has no frequency characteristics. In other words, the amplification of each frequency is extremely smooth and uniform. In the past, when triodes were popular, due to the relationship between the capacitance between the poles in the vacuum tube, it was not suitable for listening to radio broadcasts and short waves (because the high-frequency loss was too great). The reason why it has not been valued so far is that there are three reasons. First, because the amplification rate of this type of coupling method can only be equal to the amplification stage of the vacuum tube, it has to add more stages to increase its effect. Second, after using resistance coupling, the regulator is reduced, and as a result, the selectivity is also inferior. Third, this type of coupling method requires high voltage to supply the screen of the high-frequency tube; because to increase the amplification factor of the high-frequency, the resistance of the screen circuit has to be increased, so in practice, when the resistance connected to the screen circuit is equal to the screen resistance of the vacuum tube, its amplification factor is only half of the amplification factor of the vacuum tube. The greater the resistance, the higher the amplification factor, but the less voltage the screen receives, so the method of increasing the screen voltage has to be used to remedy it. Usually, the voltage connected to the screen should be at least equal to the maximum specified value of the screen voltage, and the value of the resistance connected to the screen should be three times the screen mixing resistance of the vacuum tube at most. (2) Transformer Communication Method This type of coupling method can be divided into the following two types:</p>
<p>A. Inductance Coil Transformer Coupling—The advantage of this type of coupling method lies in the fact that the amplification rate of the vacuum tube is not damaged at all, and the selectivity is also good, as shown in Figure 2. Because the coil L is like a single-turn transformer, the voltage can be increased, and the coil from the starting point to the end is like a primary coil. When the screen current passes through the primary coil, the entire coil is affected by the change of its magnetic field, so the voltage excitation secondary is caused. Also, because the initial and secondary couplings are extremely close, its mixing resistance is extremely high, and its sensitivity is not reduced because the primary coil is small, but this coupling method should pay attention to the grid capacitor. Because it is connected to both ends of the high voltage, if it is not a good product, it will not work.</p>
<p>B. Mutual Inductance Coil Transformer Coupling In ordinary radios, the most popular high-frequency coupling method is this type. In addition to the advantages of the inductance coil transformer coupling method, the advantage is that the current of the high-frequency screen circuit never leaks to the grid of the detector tube, resulting in adverse phenomena. Also, usually because the screen resistance of tetrodes and pentodes is extremely high, the number of turns of the primary coil has to be increased, resulting in weakening of the selectivity. The remedy is to place the primary and secondary stages far away or to make the distance adjustable. Sometimes, a high-frequency choke coil is used to replace the primary stage and placed in the ground wire at the secondary stage, but there are few users as shown in Figure 3.</p>

<h3>AC Wireless Motor Power Measurement Method</h3>
<p>— Wang Maosheng</p>
<p>Regardless of AC radios or sound generators, if you want to measure the power required, you can use the following method</p>
<p>In larger cities, those who use electric lights must install electricity meters. Electricity meters are used to measure the product of power and time. Any electricity meter has the number of revolutions of the turntable per kilowatt-hour (kWh) indicated, such as</p>
<p>Using the above rule, the power of the motor can be measured. Connect the motor to be measured, and turn off all electrical appliances in the room. Measure the number of revolutions of the turntable per minute or ten minutes, for example</p>
<p>The above method can not only measure power, but also verify the inductance of the choke coil and the quality of the power transformer.</p>
<h3>A More Common Tester</h3>
<p>— Cai Rixin</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the most convenient tester is a A battery, a small light bulb or a pair of headphones, but without batteries and light bulbs, anyone who has a mineral radio can also have a good tester; its wiring is as shown in the attached figure.</p>
<p>Our mineral radio does not use coil capacitors, but only uses mineral and headphones as shown in Figure 1, can't it also receive sound? Then we can use this method to divide a line into two heads to make contact heads, as shown in Figure 2. Use the two contact heads to touch the two ends of another piece, and you can prove whether this other piece has a problem; if this other piece should be connected, such as coil transformers, vacuum tube filaments, etc., there is sound in the headphones, which means that there is no broken wire, it is good; if it is not connected, such as capacitors, etc., there is sound in the headphones, which means that the contact piece, does not sound, that is good, but when testing, you should pay attention to first test the two contact heads, there is sound in the headphones, and then you can test whether the other piece has a problem, otherwise it is the fault of the tester's wiring, go to blame the other piece for having a problem, blindly start, but instead break the other piece.</p>
<h3>Wireless Broadcasting in Japan (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cai Guanghua</p>
<p>The manufacture and sale of radio receivers in Japan are still in the hands of private merchants. However, certain products are recognized and rewarded by the association authorities. At the same time, the number of separate parts and entire machines exported annually is quite astonishing.</p>
<p>Blind people, disabled people, and public institutions such as schools, etc., can request exemption from receiver fees. Hospitals of a charitable nature, lodging houses for the poor, public parks, etc., are provided with complimentary radio receivers at the expense of the association.</p>
<p>In bustling cities, there are establishments of the "Japan Broadcasting Association Consultation Center" where various general knowledge about radio and the repair of radio receivers, etc., can be entrusted to them free of charge. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Autumn Excursion Special Issue</p>
<h3>Prelude</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shouou</p>
<p>Last Saturday, we published a "Chrysanthemum and Crab" special issue, which was well-received by friends who enjoy admiring chrysanthemums and eating crabs, and we were very pleased. The next day, which happened to be Sunday, I, along with Mr. Sun Yunpu, Mr. Shen Zimao, and Mr. Zhang Mengbai from Soochow University, and literary friends Fan Yanqiao, Cheng Xiaoqing, Xu Yunqiu, and Fan Jugao, made a trip to Zheng Yi to eat crabs and Qingyang Port to admire chrysanthemums. We also took the opportunity to visit Ma'an Mountain and Ban Jian Garden in Kunshan for a leisurely tour. A small group climbed the mountain, which was a delightful and enjoyable experience. Although Ma'an Mountain is small, its large trees and strange rocks are quite attractive. If we could clear the thorns and brambles, plant plum trees on the east cliff, and peach trees on the west cliff, and make some improvements, it would surely attract countless tourists from Shanghai, which would be a small benefit to the rural economy. I hope people in Kunshan will pay attention to this. After the excursion, all my pent-up feelings disappeared. Therefore, I selected autumn excursion works from various literary friends to create another "Autumn Excursion Special Issue" to enhance the readers' travel spirit. At this time, when the five-province highway is about to be completed and the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, I hope everyone will save money from extravagant entertainment in the cities, take advantage of the clear autumn weather, and go out to play in the water and enjoy the mountains, and get close to nature, which will be beneficial to both oneself and others.</p>
<h3>Maple Leaves at Tianping</h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>These days, Suzhou has added many elegant people, all wanting to go to Tianping Mountain to see the maple leaves. Indeed! The maple leaves of Tianping Mountain are worth seeing. Cai Yun's Wu Qinyun said: "Admiring chrysanthemums at Shantang is even better than traveling, the entire year's travel pleasure is exhausted in autumn, an appointment to see the maples in Tianping in October, is only suitable for poets sitting in bamboo sedan chairs." After this opportunity passes, the north wind will gradually tighten, and the dark clouds will thicken, making it impossible to venture out for an excursion. When the elegant people arrive at Tianping Mountain and see the crimson of the maple leaves, they will surely feel that the Tang poet's saying: "Frost leaves are redder than flowers in the second month," is quite tasteful. However, do not miss the haggard and pitiful color of the rice in the fields at the foot of Tianping Mountain. At the same time, you must also look at those carrying the eight-trigram sedan chair, singing "xie xu" repeatedly, to see if their faces have the color of leaves? Because this year, the rural areas of Suzhou have suffered from drought, and in their eyes, seeing the pleasure-seeking elegant people, and thinking of the "emptiness" of the urns, tears may well be dripping from their eyes, and comparing the color with the maple leaves, who is more radiant? Therefore, the elegant people who have the strength to come and see the maple leaves, when negotiating prices with the sedan chair carriers, should be generous.</p>
<p>Saying these words may be a downer, so let me add some fun. If you want to see maple leaves, the best place is in front of the Three Grand Masters' tombs beside Gaoyi Garden at the foot of Tianping Mountain—commonly called Fan's Tomb, which has the famous Nine Branches Red, because there are nine maple trees, all with tall trunks, and the leaves grow densely. Gu Tieqing's Qing Jialu also said: "Not flowers competing for makeup, not spring contending for color. Maple forests far and near, none surpass them."</p>
<p>Apart from this place, there are many wild maple trees as well. Li Huilu's Tianping Mountain Maple Leaf Viewing Record says: "Looking at the mountains of Jilong, maple forests far and near, red leaves mixed with pine trees. When hit by frost, the leaves are all red. When the weather is slightly warm and the frost has not touched the trees, the red leaves are mixed, and the colors are bright and lovely." Sitting under the Jian Shan Pavilion, we see many shades of green interspersed with patches of red, making the green appear more ancient and the red more vivid. However, I always think that the red of spring flowers is like a young girl, while the red of frost leaves is like a middle-aged woman. Forgive me! Forgive me! Zhu Zhuzha has a poem: "The autumn colors shine on the red maple every year." He symbolizes the maple leaves with the loyalty and dedication of my ancestors.</p>
<p>I am very ashamed! I have lived in Suzhou for more than ten years and have been to Tianping six or seven times, but I have never seen the frosty red of the maple leaves. I don't have the mood to see them this year, so I can only indirectly experience a little from the writings of many elegant people.</p>
<h3>The Scenery of Dachang</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>If you use the eyes of someone touring famous mountains and great rivers to tour a remote village, it would be no different than coming out of a cinema and then looking into a peep show. Of course, you would be greatly disappointed. When I went to Dachang, I went with a heart full of different interests. Because I had no desire to explore famous scenic spots and historical sites, I unexpectedly got satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The red maple trees of Dachang Yao Village Pond are what I miss most. The purplish-red branches and leaves, one here, one there, stand on the clean riverbank, leaning against the brown fence. Looking from a distance, it is like a purplish haze, solidified on the powdery blue sky of early winter. If I were a talented poet, I might write hundreds of fluent lyrical poems here. Strolling leisurely to the west end of the town, the Jade Dragon Bridge, like a crescent moon, will lie gracefully before your eyes. The stream flows with or without force, hitting the bridge legs, and also exhaling some slight sounds. Light a mild cigarette, lean against the bridge railing, and browse at will. To the north, hidden in the dark green forest, is the old French Concession Temple. In front of the temple is a large ginkgo tree, its branches high, grasping the sky, and its trunk several dozen arm spans in circumference. To the south is the secluded Yao Family Nunnery, with red walls covered with green tiles, which will cleanse the dust from the rustic people. The field breeze often blows the door lamp under the eaves, with the demeanor of a simple young woman's earlobe.</p>
<p>Having been to Baohua Zen Monastery, people who are fascinated by Westernization will feel that the architectural art of the ancient Eastern country is not bad either, with carved beams and painted pillars, and a golden splendor. The site is more than one hundred acres in size, and the pavilions, terraces, and buildings are connected one after another, like walking into the royal palace of the Middle Ages. In the western part of the courtyard is a release site, where geese, ducks, chickens, cattle, sheep, pigs... have all been released by some philanthropists. The livestock have obtained the guarantee of life here, and they cry happily. In the center of the courtyard is Mirror Lake, with the Lakeside Pavilion supported in the air. The two characters "Xun Ran" on the vermilion plaque are golden. In the evening, climb the pavilion to see the sunset glow and the setting sun. The natural colors are all captured in the eyes. When there is no wind, the lake water is as calm as a mirror, and the reflections of the trees are as if there is another world in the lake. Is it a landscape painting in a glass frame?</p>
<p>Although there are no famous scenic spots and historical sites in Dachang, the fields, bamboo fences, thatched cottages, the quiet town streets, and everything that resembles a recluse, are enough for me to linger and forget to return. Those who are used to eating coarse fish and meat must eat some vegetables and fruits, so it seems that travelers who have visited famous mountains and rivers do not have to give up this remote and leisurely village.</p>

<h3>Autumn Night on the Lake</h3>
<p>— Fei Ma</p>
<p>On that cool autumn moonlit night, we rowed a small boat, gently sailing on the shimmering lake.</p>
<p>A semi-circular moon hung in the azure sky, with dense woods along the small embankments on both sides, as if intertwined with misty night fog, only seeing clumps that looked like smoke. The brilliance of the bright moon poured fully on the lake surface, sparkling like silver dust.</p>
<p>Our small boat gently and slowly wandered on the lake. On that dim and quiet lake, except for the sound of oars and water, mixed with the wing sounds of flying white gulls, no other sound could be found. The silent lake, governed by the god of night, especially displayed greatness and solemnity. And how small did our small boat feel?</p>
<p>Ah! Quiet lake, lake in a dream, with flocks of white gulls flying, our lonely boat dashing lightly, in such a lonely universe.</p>
<p>The vast world, is it originally just this lonely boat, a few pairs of white gulls, and half a cool moon embellishing it? Then this world is too dreary and too desolate. I, who am sentimental, couldn't help but sigh with emotion at this time. Alas! It is really "I intend to ask the bright moon about my sorrows, but in vain I entrust my worries to Li Sao...."</p>
<p>The white gulls flew away gracefully, and together with the light of the bright moon, disappeared into the deep night fog.</p>
<p>Ah! In the treasure box of the autumn night, it turns out that such a mysterious realm is hidden, the quiet lake water is dyed with infinite melancholy; the lake of autumn night! It is really like a lonely poem.</p>
<p>On this autumn lake, only a small lonely boat, carrying a few of us autumn-sorrowful tourists, swayed leisurely in it.</p>
<h3>Autumn Morning in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>— Yun Xun</p>
<p>Jiangwan after the catastrophe still reveals the desolate traces of trauma. Fortunately, the city government, the highest administrative organ of the city, is built in the central area, embellishing a lot of peaceful scenes. People struggling for life are constantly coming and going on Jiangwan Road; there are also several famous universities there. Although they are also refugees after the catastrophe, thanks to the efforts of their leaders to revive them, they have decorated the desolate Jiangwan like "still as I was"; the winding Sports Association Road and Xiangyin Road, which stretch for several miles, are held in the paper palms of Jiangwan; the morning air is very fresh, although it is not as lofty as Mogan Mountain and Lushan, it is better than some so-called sanitariums in the busy city; in the misty morning, seeing the morning glow slowly climbing down from the nearby power poles and the treetops of distant dense shade trees, to the vast fields and the empty countryside; although autumn is deep, the leaves are not yet scorched yellow, but a faint layer of thin frost has already touched people's eyes in the clear morning. The more the morning light shines, the more this layer of thin frost is subjected to irresistible encroachment; from the congealed ice body, it melts into countless dew drops, at this time the tree trunks on the side of the road, the heavy walls facing the sun, are like exchanging hot tears! Water smoke rises everywhere! Rolling to the high places of the road, spreading to the low places of the ditches.</p>
<p>In Jiangwan, there is no trace of "old men falling" [a colloquial term for collapsing houses], no loud rumbling of manure carts can be seen or heard; in the distance, the crowing of chickens and barking of dogs can be heard, and on the road, there are the sounds of horses' hooves learning to ride, and the sounds of running steps training for races; economic students believe that washing and dyeing are too expensive, so they contract it out to the washerwomen in the vicinity. This morning, they are very active, with small feet hobbling, carrying and shouldering piles of clothes and bedding, preparing to exhaust their energy to exchange for a day's worth of thin tea and plain rice; hawker A Jin, rain or shine, this morning, his cries of selling sesame cakes and fried dough sticks are deafening! That kind of bleak mood is just separated from "opening a golden dragon hand" by a wall.</p>
<h3>Scenic Spots for Autumn Excursions</h3>
<p>— (Shou Juan)</p>
<p>Scenic spots for autumn excursions can be found throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang; and if you want to find ones that are time-saving and economical, I would exclusively recommend Suzhou. Tianping and Lingyan are certainly worth lingering over, and Tiger Hill and Maple Bridge are also quite good. Here, I especially collect excellent poems about autumn excursions from the past to attract tourists. The lakes and mountains are so beautiful, why not come!</p>
<p>Tiger Hill　The temple gate, the road back home, is east of the willow embankment, in October, the heavy frost is piercing, and the early geese are calling. It is best when the sun is slanting and people have left, a sky of red leaves falling in the west wind.</p>
<p>Maple Bridge　The green river and red trees are desolate in the evening, a leaf floats in the reed flowers, the bright moon fills the boat and the sky is in the water, and the sound of gentle oars passes Maple Bridge.</p>
<p>Tianping　Being in the clouds, one cannot see the clouds, climbing forgets that the sun is setting, turning back to identify the road we came from, only the sound of springs can be heard through the trees.</p>
<p>Lingyan　Shaking our clothes, we ascend the Rainbow Pavilion together, the ancient pagoda enters the clouds deep and obscure, the fragrant path is overgrown with weeds, and the autumn dew is white, mountain villages are everywhere with evening smoke green, a wild goose in the sky comes to Xukou, and the peaks can be seen in the Dongting, do not cherish the past more towards the west wind, the clear song of the water chestnut rises in the distant shallows.</p>
<h3>Jinhua Double Dragon Cave</h3>
<p>— Qixia Louzhu</p>
<p>Sitting in a white cloth bamboo sedan, all the way from Jinhua County, the sun is climbing high, and the entire North Mountain is shrouded in a silvery-gray midday mist. This is a very beautiful cloud mist, and on top of it are three famous stone caves, the uppermost being Chaozhen, the middle one being Binghu, and the one at the foot of the mountain being Shuanglong (Double Dragon).</p>
<p>After resting for a while in the village in front of the cave, we took off our heavy clothes, put on straw sandals, took a torch, and headed for the Shuanglong Cave in one breath. Halfway there, we could already hear the sound of springs in the mountain stream. Five or six arrow-lengths away from the cave, we heard two columns of waterfalls gushing out of the winding ditch covered with messy leaves, flying like broken silver in the sunlight.</p>
<p>It is a large iron urn-like cave, which can accommodate six or seven hundred people, with the opening opening up, as high as five or six zhang. On the cave is carved the large characters "Thirty-Six Cave Heavens". On the left side of the cave, a stone dragon slants out. Originally there was one on the right side as well, but it has been destroyed by wind and rain. This is the origin of the name "Double Dragon". Inside the cave stands an inscription by Wang Songmu of the Ming Dynasty Wanli era, which explains it very clearly, and also says that the Six Dynasties poet Liu Xiaobiao once lectured in the Chaozhen Cave.</p>
<p>The cave is divided into inner and outer parts. The outer cave is fully illuminated by sunlight, and several farmers guarding the cave are chatting there. As soon as they saw us arrive, they immediately came out to greet us and asked: "Are you planning to go into the inner cave?" While speaking, they put their hands behind their backs and led us to the edge of a spring flowing out of the inner cave. This spring is full of dark water, making small, clear sounds, but it is impossible to know exactly where it comes from and where it goes.</p>
<p>The cave guard stopped, pointed at the small boat in the marsh, this boat is very much like the lotus picking basin of Shanyin, he told us, to enter the inner cave, you must lie straight and stiff in the belly of the boat, not allowed to move, one move will touch the rock, letting the cave guard use a rope to pull you in. …</p>
<p>However, I thought: The boundary line that opens the inner and outer caves is a rock cave at the foot of the mountain. This rock cave is less than four feet in all directions, vertically and horizontally. What if I lie on the boat and get sent into another world, where bats with large black wings fly, stout pythons swim, and mountain goblins covered in green hair run!</p>
<p>However, the small boat remained on the bank of the marsh, and I saw with my own eyes another farmer lying on the boat in the same way, being towed into the inner cave, and immediately disappeared. The small boat was towed out of the outer cave again.</p>
<p>What reason is there to decline? Can't I visit the mysterious cave like others? So I stepped onto the small boat, really like a dead body, lying across the water, only feeling a darkness in front of my eyes, a layer of coolness flowing out of my whole body, and the water sounds murmured softly, I completely lost the function of my eyes, although I still have eyes; because surrounding me is an invisible, infinite darkness!</p>
<p>I only heard someone calling: "Come up! You've arrived." However, I don't believe this is a human voice. A human voice is definitely not so gloomy. When I looked carefully, I saw a spike of fire flashing in the black mist, and where the light shone, the farmer who had come in earlier was standing.</p>
<p>I immediately jumped up from the boat, and with the farmer's traction, I stepped onto the stone bank of sand and water, my straw sandals soaked in the water, so I also lit a torch. This faint light is really small, only able to illuminate the faces of people within three steps. After all the companions had arrived, and all the torches were lit, we began to tour this dark world full of stalactite wonders.</p>
<p>The large stone platform in the cave is as wide as one mu of field, but to go up, because it is low from the dome, people must crawl on their hands like turtles, with their abdomens close to the slippery stone, to succeed in walking down the stone platform, and continue to touch their way into a pool of blue water, where you can walk barefoot in the pool, and this is the Dragon Pool.</p>
<p>As for the stalactites, some hang like tassels, some coil like dragons, and some fly like phoenixes, their shapes are different, each extremely its state, what is similar is that the stalactites are as white as snow and as bright as alum, which is truly extremely valuable. If you want to know more about the stalactite shapes in this cave, I would like everyone to read Xie Gaoyu, a great Confucian of the Song Dynasty,s "Record of the Characters, Objects, and Ancient Relics in the Jinhua Cave," and you will be able to understand it at a glance.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>More on "Wu Xia Proverbial Couplets"</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>A month ago, I published an article "A Record of Proverbs" in Free Talk, mentioning Wu Xia Proverbial Couplets. Subsequently, Mr. Jin Zutong published an article "Regarding Wu Xia Proverbial Couplets," saying that he had this rare (?) book. A few days later, he kindly sent it over for me to borrow. The leaves of the book were slightly worm-eaten, but they were lined and mounted separately, and the words were not damaged. - I was really extremely happy.</p>
<p>This book is in four volumes, bound in four books. The author is Wang Youguang, style name Guanguo, sobriquet Beizhuang, from Qingpu. He was also known as Qingpu Su Shi, which was because he compiled the proverbial couplets to the last couplet:</p>
<p>Coming early, water for washing hair; coming late, water for washing muddy hair.</p>
<p>Before Qingming, hanging gold coins; after Qingming, hanging copper coins.</p>
<p>Just ten days before Qingming in the fourth year of Jiaqing, the Supreme Emperor died, and there was an edict to remove the red color. He then changed the colored couplet and wrote a couplet on plain paper to hang on the door:</p>
<p>The whole world is full of sadness,</p>
<p>Revering Fudan Chonghua at the time of praise.</p>
<p>At the end of the couplet, he signed himself Wang Youguang, a subject of Qingpu Su Shi. Presumably, he was from the Hanlin Academy and had received favors from the Qing Dynasty, so he was naturally grateful to tears. Therefore, he "dropped his pen in tears, and never continued the couplets." Wu Xia Proverbial Couplets ended here.</p>
<p>What official position did Mr. Wang actually hold? I think I can find it in the Qingpu County Chronicle. On the first day of the first month of this year, when his proverbial couplets ended, it was his sixtieth birthday. He said in his autobiographical poem:</p>
<p>The only son inherits the ancient rites,</p>
<p>Two houses are jointly inherited by the grace of the emperor.</p>
<p>It turns out that he "complied with the grace and jointly inherited the ancestral temples of two houses" as an only son, so he had to be grateful for the emperor's grace! Therefore, we know that he did indeed hold an official position. Beyond that, I do not know his deeds.</p>
<p>The proverbial couplets are divided into four categories: Qi Mu (opening remarks), Zheng Mu (main remarks), Xu Mu (supplementary remarks), and Mo Mu (end remarks), which occupy about two-fifths of the volume of Volume One. From here on, they are all explanations of the meaning, stories, and origins of these proverbs. Why did he write this book? He said when explaining the phrase "grinding the sun" in Volume Four:</p>
<p>Life is no more than a hundred years. The sky has sunlight, and people have effort. Once it passes without leaving a trace, even if one enjoys a hundred years of life, how can one see this person in these hundred years? Only by using my effort to grind this sunlight, grinding one day carefully, getting it from the ears and eyes, understanding it in the mind, shaping it in pen and ink, and later viewers can estimate its sunlight and imagine what kind of person he is. Compared to those who pass by hastily, there will naturally be a place to recognize, knowing that on such and such a day in such and such a month of such and such a year, someone worked hard to grind it. The grinding of flour is fine with a stone mill, the grinding of axes and hatchets is sharp with stone, the grinding of nanmu is shiny with water, and the grinding of writing is long with sunlight. Su Shi collected proverbial couplets in the first year of Jiaqing, put down his pen for more than a year, but it was still difficult to spend day and night on the road, on the boat, and in bed. He still explores human emotions and physical principles in street talk and lane words, and never fails to record them in his heart, occasionally recording them. Now it has become another volume, and he is not letting this sunlight pass.</p>
<p>Haha! Mr. Wang wrote and collected Wu Xia Proverbial Couplets as a way to pass the time in his later years, using it to grind the sunlight. He said, "The grinding of writing is long with sunlight." Is his book actually a work of lasting life? According to his great-grandson Zhi Xun Shengrong's preface to the reprinted book:</p>
<p>This book refers to the remaining intentions of the poem history, with beauty and thorns implicitly advising and punishing, inspiring people to think deeply. Starting with colloquial language, it is easier to approach than books that persuade goodness, and it is enough to prepare a motto for awakening the world. It has been carved since Gengchen in Jiaqing, and it has been widely circulated.</p>
<p>It can be seen that this book was very popular at that time, and it was probably really regarded as a "good book" or "motto" kind of book. Now, if we want to look at it from the perspective of folklore, of course, it has another meaning.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>However, Mr. Wang understands the psychology of readers very well. He doesn't just care about teaching people, like "books that persuade goodness" and "mottos for awakening the world," which are dry, tasteless, pedantic, and laughable. Although his book teaches people, it is very touching and can at least be worthy of the evaluation of "beneficial when opening the book, and flavorful when closing the book." The three couplets of Qi Mu are:</p>
<p>Opening the plate with laughter, Ten Pattern Brocade, Step by step higher,</p>
<p>The aftertaste is sweet. Hundred Ugly Pictures. Every one is good.</p>
<p>Each sentence is followed by an explanation, combined with an explanation of the purpose and skills of compiling this book. Explaining the phrase "opening the plate with laughter," he said:</p>
<p>In Wu Xia wedding ceremonies, during the betrothal, the decorations include bringing two Immortals of Harmony into the plate. The host opens the box and catches a glimpse of joy and happiness. The proverb calls it "opening the plate with laughter." The ancients said that a small attempt to write an essay, opening the lecture with the topic, should be lively and moving, also using "opening the plate with laughter" to compare it. I see that those who compile books start with a preface, then general examples, followed by a catalog, and the main text has not yet entered, and the reader's color is tired. I collect proverbs, and one title is enough to amuse, which is "opening the plate with laughter."</p>
<p>It can be seen that he wanted to grab the psychology of the reader from the beginning of compiling this book. Also explaining the phrase "the aftertaste is sweet," he said:</p>
<p>The most taboo thing about writing is a single layer. Can the Fu Xing Bi of the Mao Poems be fully understood at a glance? Those who establish a theory must lead people into the winner, like eating green plums, which are astringent at first, then like chewing wax, and then sweet, called the Jian Fruit, the speaker is not guilty, and the listener is enough to be warned. I annotated proverbs, making street talk and alley discussions into mottos, which is "the aftertaste is sweet."</p>
<p>The reason why this book can lead people into the winner is that it takes into account both teaching and fun. As for his saying "Comparing it to Ten Pattern Brocade, the collection is similar to good words and deeds." "Comparing it to Hundred Ugly Pictures, the collection is similar to those that contain ridicule and satire." It is also said very realistically. He also explained the phrase "step by step higher," saying:</p>
<p>Called proverb, then the characters may be different; called couplet, then the text must be neat. This collection starts from two characters, to three characters, four characters, five characters, six characters, counting to twelve characters, from less to more, from short to long, recording them in order, like going through stairs, so it is called "step by step higher."</p>
<p>This is how he arranged the proverbial couplets. He also explained the phrase "every one is good," saying:</p>
<p>The article is called a chapter, the poem is called a first, the song is called a one, the proverb is similar to the song, and it is also called a one. Su Shi recorded and annotated it, making the vulgar elegant, the corrupt new, and examining those with allusions, so that under the reading, the dignified take its purity, the harmonious appreciate its style, each is suitable, so it is called "every one is good."</p>
<p>Those proverbs may not really be as good as he said, but there are many good ones, that goes without saying.</p>
<p>As for the explanations he gave for each proverb, most of them are taken from folk legends, such as Zhong Kui eating little ghosts, Lohan inviting Amitabha, there is empty green in the world, the character "lai" (come) is spoken as "qu" (go), earthen jars break only at the well, peonies do not bring their mother's soil, no one goes to the Three Treasures Hall without a reason, shady ground is not as good as a good heart, these explanations of his are very valuable materials for folklore. The value of the book Wu Xia Proverbial Couplets lies here.</p>
<h3>The South Sea Coast in Winter</h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>Early winter in Shanghai already carries a hint of frosty cold, gently stirring the traveler's nostalgic mood. The window screens, permeated by the wind that seeps into people's hearts, flutter, oh, so forlornly!</p>
<p>The winter in the South is lovely. Last year, we lived a farming life in a wilderness near the South Sea coast. Three young people who had broken away from their families worked so joyfully on a farm! The seawater in winter still carries a hint of autumn. We immersed ourselves in the water every day so wonderfully, catching fish! Carrying water to water the vegetables! Chatting! Hoeing the soil! Cooking! The days passed so leisurely. I lived the life of a farmer for more than a month before leaving after half a winter.</p>
<p>The winter in the South is gentle, unlike the severe cold of the North, where snow assaults the earth and people mostly hide indoors. However, when we were in the South, we only needed to wear a little clothing, drifting in the gusts of sea breeze. Sometimes, we sailed our own small fishing boat from the farm to the edge of the South Sea. The restless waves sometimes frightened us, the small boat, like a leaf, couldn't withstand the terrifying big waves. We drifted into the reeds, where we quietly watched the fields on the shore, the distant steamships floating on the sea, and the pairs of seabirds constantly diving from the clear sky onto the wave crests to catch small fish. The sunlight, gently emitted from the azure sky, made us laugh and talk even more enthusiastically. What a poetic life in the lovely natural world! Gently, gently, we drifted back to the farm, cooking! Working! Living our days so happily.</p>
<p>During the day, besides working, I often wandered alone in straw sandals on the fields. At that time, children often ran on the muddy paths between the fields, both boys and girls were so happy, as if without sorrow. They didn't know the misfortunes of the world and played, sometimes arguing. I would join their group to mediate, and tell them interesting stories. In this way, they came to play at our farm very happily, and our little dog also enjoyed playing with them. The village children are wild and lovable.</p>
<p>The winter in the South has no snow, so many children, when they hear stories about snow, tilt their heads in confusion and cast doubtful glances. I told them:</p>
<p>"Snow falls from the sky like soft cotton, instantly turning the world into silver. Then the children play with snow, making snowmen, how interesting!"</p>
<p>Then, they laughed, they imagined the loveliness of snow. But now I have wandered to this world of snow, where the white snow is about to turn the world cold and terrible. How deeply I remember the gentleness of the South and the lovely life on the coast.</p>
<h3>Mother Won't Have That Happiness</h3>
<p>— Yang Fan</p>
<p>Parents often have a special fondness for their "firstborn" and "lastborn" children. However, comparatively speaking, the fondness for the "firstborn" is often temporary, while the fondness for the "lastborn" is always permanent. The reason for this is simple: the eldest son gets married, the eldest daughter gets married, and the intimacy will inevitably gradually decrease. The younger son and younger daughter are different, they have a longer time to follow their parents. "All parents love their youngest children," that is indeed a very frank confession from parents.</p>
<p>A person who holds the stubborn view of "a married daughter is like spilled water" will certainly love her younger son more. But generally, due to temperament, mothers always cherish their younger daughters. This is because daughters can be obedient, listen, serve, and if they are smart, they can also comfort their mothers' troubled hearts. Therefore, we are quite familiar with the term "pearl in the palm."</p>
<p>But Mother wrote in her letter: "On the sixteenth, I gave birth to another baby girl. In these years of famine and chaos, it is already extremely difficult to maintain our adult lives. How can we have the leisure to raise this child? Therefore, two days after giving birth, I asked someone to send her to the orphanage..." Indeed, Mother is already forty-seven years old, and it is indeed an unbearable suffering to wash diapers in freezing weather and pad ash bags in heavy snow! Sending her away, although Mother's compassionate heart will suffer a very deep and heavy blow, what can be done? In these times, even adults cannot survive!</p>
<p>Mother's life experience is certainly not narrow. She should have known that having a little girl to support her in her old age is an unsurpassed happiness. But for her—in the currently broken family—such extravagance is not allowed. We are too poor, the family is poor, and the sons are also poor. Raising a small life is definitely not as simple as raising chickens or dogs. In addition to providing the bare minimum of food and clothing, there is also an incalculable amount of time to add. Mother understood this, so she did it so heartlessly!</p>
<p>However, isn't it a bit cruel? Don't villagers call sending a child to the orphanage "sending them to their death"?—How can this problem be resolved perfectly? I am ashamed that I do not have the ability to resolve it perfectly.</p>
<p>On the streets, we often see many young ladies supporting elderly ladies walking. Mother will not have that happiness! She understands everything. Since she did that, I want to dissuade her, but I don't have the courage to dissuade her.</p>
<p>Seeing Mother's simple words, my quiet heart is lost again.</p>
<h3>The Wandering Swordsman (3)</h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>The price is cheap, usually two dollars might not even be enough. Now a dollar, eighty cents, fifty cents! Forty cents: because he's short on travel expenses. But even after he lowers the price all the way to a dime a piece, business still isn't bustling.</p>
<p>Crows circle above the spire of the red building at the train station. The lowered brim of his hat can no longer completely block the sunlight from shining into those bright little eyes, and the people have already left. He sighs, packs up his knapsack, and slyly sweeps his gaze around. He's leaving too.</p>
<p>His back view is as desolate as his business. He walks unusually slowly, some leisurely people catch up to him, then pass him, he pays no attention. His head is slightly lowered, gazing at his faint shadow in the setting sun. His shoulders are uneven, one high and one low, vying with each other, he looks like a cripple who has suffered from rheumatism.</p>
<p>A drunk-looking person grabs his shoulder, shaking him violently. Fierce eyes stare at his dirty face, which resembles a mushroom, and shouts loudly:</p>
<p>"Old fellow! Coming from Tianjin tomorrow, right? Tomorrow?"</p>
<p>He sidesteps, smiling meekly. That cold smile is well-suited to his squinting eyes and twitching mustache. He pokes his nose, which is slightly to the right, with his index finger, looks at the fields, then looks at the drunken face, as if trying to find a comparison. But he says nothing.</p>
<p>"Big bowl of wine, Shandong produces 'highwaymen,' hahaha... Tianjin is a good place, go on, the devils will dig out your conscience and drug you. Go on, swindler!"</p>
<p>The man shoves him, laughing loudly, and staggers away. He sings lewd songs haphazardly, making pig-like noises. He almost falls. He doesn't say anything, only his shaking head lowers further. He wipes his nose, like a very generous person who is solely worried about the world's troubles, muttering. Then continues to walk forward.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Pressure Continues, Gold Price Drops Again by $3.90</h3>
<p>Central Bank Dumps, Big Players Cut Long Positions, Lowest at $71.40</p>
<p>Banks' Appetite Strong, Purchase Aggressively, Recovering Beyond $80</p>
<p>Since the gold market began to fall two days ago, the market yesterday continued to see selling pressure, almost breaking through the $70 mark. However, due to traffic (likely meaning transportation companies or individuals involved in shipping or finance) and the Central Bank buying in cheap, confidence stabilized. Afterwards, with banks aggressively purchasing, prices gradually rebounded after hitting a low. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets showed gains in both the UK and the US. London spot gold rose by half a penny, and exchange rates rose slightly. Off-market pre-market trading opened flat, still at $83-84. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with the UK and US unchanged, and customs gold rising by 1 cent. The situation remained flat after the opening. Soon, banks began dumping shillings, and the Central Bank dumped US dollars, hardening the exchange market. Major players sold their gold holdings, and even with buyers, it was difficult to maintain prices. The $80 mark was finally broken, and the decline continued strongly. However, due to Chinese merchants buying on the cheap, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced its exchange rates, with the UK unchanged and the US up by 0.0625. Confidence turned from fatigue to stability, and the exchange market gradually tightened, allowing prices to recover beyond $80. However, major players still had an appetite to sell. At this time, prices hovered around $80. Later, the Central Bank announced the silver equalization tax, still at 7%. The exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 875 points. However, Reuters mistakenly reported 8%, a rise of one cent from the previous day. Confidence surged, and short positions were quickly covered, briefly rebounding. But major players paid no attention, supplying gold holdings at high prices. Soon, Reuters corrected the report, and sellers regained activity and retreated. The situation was quite stable for a long time. However, with banks still having a selling appetite, and prices retreating into the $80 range, selling pressure remained strong. Major players also came to cut their long positions, and the exchange market hardened further, falling repeatedly. Although there was a rebound due to buyers taking advantage of the low prices, the trend was weakest at noon. In the afternoon market, due to the continued hardening of the exchange market, speculative selling occurred. Major players closed their positions and went short, and the market fell again. Soon, due to traffic (likely shipping or finance) and the Central Bank purchasing US dollars on the cheap, confidence revived, and prices were gradually raised. However, with the Central Bank dumping again at high prices, prices fell again after rising. At this time, the market was mediocre, but the overall trend had stabilized. Afterwards, although Indian silver was reported to have risen slightly, confidence was strong again because the banks' purchasing appetite was particularly strong. Rumors of the French gold standard continuing to be maintained spread, and major players rushed to cover their positions. The gold market gradually rose, and short positions were quickly closed. The closing price was strongest, recovering beyond the $80 mark after closing. The day's market was still subdued by the exchange market, recovering strongly after being weak. The future still shows a rising trend. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $983, a slight drop of 10 cents from the previous close. Banque Belge pour l'Etranger (華比) and Citibank (花旗) dumped December contracts at 125 and 1875 points. The Central Bank released December US dollars at 6875 points.

December US dollars at 625 were eagerly sought. Although Xiangfeng (祥豐) sold heavily at the $80 border, it was only a slight struggle. The Central Bank released January US dollars at 625. Yuanmao, Yongxiangfeng, Dafa, and Yong took advantage of the high prices to unload, retreating to $79.10. Soon, the Central Bank's silver equalization tax was announced as unchanged, but Reuters mistakenly reported a rise of one cent. Buying sentiment surged, Yuanchun (元春), Fuxingyong (福興永), Yuanyuan Kangxiang (源康祥), Dakang (大康), and retail shorts rushed in, rising to $93.70. But major players supplied gold holdings aggressively, and there was a lack of buyers. Fuxingyong, Yuanmao Yong, Tongtaichang (同泰昌), Shengshengda (生大) sold to 02 cents, Hengyu took advantage of the low prices to purchase, and rebounded to $1.60, and the price hovered around. However, January US dollars at 625 could be closed, making it difficult to rise further. Tongfu (同福), Dingtai (鼎泰), Xin Chang (信錩) sold, and the price fell again to $77.80. Bingxing (丙興) and Hengyu still had a buying appetite, gradually rising to $9.40. Mitsui (三井) released January US dollars at 6875, and selling pressure remained strong. Yuqingyong (餘慶永), Qingyu (慶餘元), Chun Yuanmao Yong (春元茂永), Yuanyuan Kangxiang (元源康祥), Dafa Yong (大發永), Fu Taiheng (福泰亨), Tianfengyong (天豐永) all sold aggressively, falling to $73. Yifengyong (義豐永), Fuxingyong (福興永) took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, and Great Britain (大英) purchased January US dollars at 875, rebounding to $5.50. However, selling pressure did not abate, Tianfengyong (天豐永), Fuyusen (福餘森), Changyong (昌永) sold gold holdings together. Although Zhaofengchang (兆豐昌) and others purchased, the price still fell to $2.10. The noon closing was $972.60, and the market remained weak after closing.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $971.40. Fuxingyong (福興永), Yicheng (益成), Hengyu (恒餘), Yuqingyong (餘慶永) purchased holdings, rising to $3.20. Fuchang (福昌), Senchangyong (森昌永), Dadecheng (大德成), Yuanmao Yong (元茂永) sold holdings, retreating to $1.70. The Central Bank purchased Banque Belge pour l'Etranger (華比) December US dollars at 9375. Confidence surged, and retail Qingfayong (慶發永), Hengyu (恒餘), Huixiang (惠祥), Fuan (福安), Shunmao (順茂), Tongyi (同益) all aggressively purchased holdings. Meifeng (美豐) purchased January US dollars at 875, rising to $7.30. Banque Belge pour l'Etranger (華比) sold December shillings at 1875, Dalian Gang (大連帮), Chun Zhen Tai (春震泰), Shunmao (順茂), Yuan Chang Yong (元昌永), Richang (日昌), Qingyu (慶餘) unloaded, gradually falling to $2.60. The Central Bank continued to sell drafts. But confidence had stabilized, Hengchangyong (恒昌永), Fuchangfu (福昌福), Yuyi Hengyu (餘恒餘), Yuanmao Yong (元茂永), Tongtaichang (同泰昌) purchased holdings, gradually rising beyond $5. Qingyu Yuanmao Yong (慶餘元茂永) unloaded, falling again to $3.40. The report of an increase of two annas for Indian silver had no impact. Dingkang (鼎康), Hengyu (恒餘), Shunmao (順茂), Huixiang (惠祥), Yuansheng Yong (元盛永), Fu Taiheng (福泰亨), Dadecheng (大德成) all aggressively purchased holdings, eventually rebounding to $9.30. After hovering, the price was eventually pressed down. The closing price was $979.20, barely avoiding a double settlement price. After closing, Yuanmao Yong (元茂永), Dadecheng (大德成) continued to purchase, breaking through $80. The highest price of the day was $983.70, and the lowest price was $971.40, a fluctuation of $12.30. As a result, the price fell again by $3.90 compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's gold standard price, rose to $987, approximately $8 higher than the closing price, $4 higher than the previous close. The November old standard, with HSBC's exchange rate for US dollars rising by 0.0625, resulted in a gold standard price of over $1052. The book price for this month is $973, $973 for December, $973 for the morning water adjustment, and $979 for the afternoon water adjustment. The red gold price added approximately $8.50, for a listed price of $991.50. There were still few transactions in the market, because the swap market was lacking, and the spot buying appetite was weak. The swap market did not officially trade, and buyers still had to pay approximately $2. It depended on the source of spot goods. There were a few transactions at $1.50 in the black market.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was chaotic. Overall, Senchangyong (森昌永), Hengxingyuan (恒興源), Yuanmao Yong (元茂永), Tongchun Shen (同春申), Qingfayong (慶發永), Yuan Chang Yong (元昌永), Daxingyong (大興永), Xiangfeng (祥豐), Tianfengyong (天豐永), Yingxiang (迎祥), Tongfu (同福), Yuanchun (元春), Ruikang (瑞康), Wanxing (萬興), Shunli (順利) were on the selling side.

Ren Yongda (壬 永大), Yongdingtai (永鼎泰), Futaiheng (福泰亨), Xingchang (興昌), Yuqingyong (餘慶永) entered the market first and exited later. Speculators also did the same. Tongtaichang (同泰昌), Richang (日昌), Dafengyong (大豐永) entered first and exited later. Dalian Gang (大連帮) and Wanxing (萬興) jointly traded 2,500 contracts, netting over 700.

<h3>Central Bank Continues to Dump Foreign Exchange, Becoming More Loose and Abundant</h3>
<p>According to foreign reports yesterday, London spot silver rose nearly 125, US bank long 25, forward silver market also rose 1 cent, London spot gold rose half a penny, British to US rose 125, US to British shrank half a point, British to French rose 7 pounds, US to French rose 25. The morning opening of the exchange market saw the near-term selling price for British exchange at 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 0375 points, and the US exchange at $33.5625, with British looser by 03125 and US tighter by 0625 compared to the previous close. After the opening, banks relentlessly sold. The Central Bank's listed prices for British and US were unchanged, and London spot gold rose by 1 cent, but the process trended towards loosening. However, due to Chinese merchants buying in on the cheap, HSBC announced its listed prices, with British unchanged and US up 0625, and confidence trended towards stabilization, gradually tightening. Afterwards, the Central Bank's silver equalization tax announcement remained unchanged, but Reuters mistakenly reported an increase of one cent, and the market tightened sharply. However, banks still had an appetite to sell, and Chinese merchants' psychology was unstable. Afterwards, it hardened again. The afternoon market was still hard, but traffic (likely shipping or finance) and the Central Bank bought in on the cheap, and confidence revived and tightened. However, the Central Bank continued to suppress prices, and there were still positions. The banks' appetite was extremely strong, allowing prices to be maintained. Chinese merchants' psychology was also good, and prices eventually tightened. Rumors spread that the French franc would continue to be maintained. The closing near-term selling price for British exchange was 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 1875 points, and the US exchange was $33.8125, with British looser by 125 and US tighter by 1875 compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants slightly bought, and banks' buying appetites were especially strong. The Central Bank dumped, with drafts estimated at over 100,000 pounds and over 1 million US dollars.

<p>The Call Money Rate Remains the Same, Clearing is Slightly Tighter</p>
<p>According to custom, during the Western merchants' horse racing season, customs clearance is closed for half a day, and businesses are open all day on Thursdays and Fridays, making clearing more complex. There is a mutual difference between simple and complex for half-day business. Although the market situation is depressed during this autumn race, the transport of imported goods is more complex than that of domestic goods. Therefore, foreign merchants' clearing is also more than that of Chinese merchants. Yesterday was Friday, and businesses were open all day, and today is the weekend, which is the last day of the autumn race. According to custom, customs clearance is closed for half a day, so yesterday's clearing situation seemed busier than usual. The call money rate in the market remained the same. The morning and afternoon markets were both at 12 cents, with premiums ranging from 23 cents to 56 cents. The situation was slightly stronger. Early morning trading in draft transfer totals over 3.2 million, new trading totals over 500,000, afternoon trading totals over 100,000, trading at the Small General Association totals over 300,000. Due to the failure to fully reach 100% of the foreign exchange pledge loans, there are still many opportunities to make loans recently. The amount of redemption yesterday was only 8-900,000, and the amount of loans made was 1.4-1.5 million. Banknotes returned totaled over 800,000, issued totaled over 600,000, customer source totaled 150,000, and demand totaled 200,000. Bank clearing: foreign banks cleared drafts totaling over 2.7-2.8 million, various goods, foreign exchange pledge and miscellaneous loans cleared over 5.1 million, foreign exchange settlement totaled over 1.2 million, special exchange totaled over 400,000, and warehouse entry totaled 600,000. Chinese banks cleared drafts totaling over 3.7-3.8 million, various goods, foreign exchange pledge and miscellaneous loans cleared over 5.7-5.8 million, foreign exchange settlement totaled over 900,000, and warehouse exit totaled 400,000. Japanese banks cleared drafts totaling over 2.4 million, various goods, foreign exchange pledge and miscellaneous loans cleared over 4.3-4.4 million, foreign exchange settlement totaled over 500,000, and warehouse exit totaled 500,000. Money changers' foreign public bills cleared over 29 million, foreign head transfers cleared over 3.7-3.8 million, interbank transfers totaled over 600,000, and cash collected totaled 2-300,000. Also, the total number of checks exchanged at the local clearing house on the 9th was 9,458,410.94 yuan, including 5,631,167.42 yuan in silver and 3,827,243.52 yuan in exchange silver.</p>
<p>The Fluctuation of Subsidiary Coinage is Minimal</p>
<p>Yesterday, the difference between morning and afternoon prices for Jiangnan subsidiary coin was only $1.50, with the morning price at $827 and the afternoon price at $828.50, resulting in a price increase of $1 compared to the morning price on the previous day. The number of transactions in the morning market was 4,000 jiao (角), and the number of transactions in the afternoon market was 6,000 jiao (角). The morning price for Guangdong subsidiary coin was $749, and the afternoon price was $748.50, resulting in a price decrease of approximately $1 compared to the previous day's price, but the situation was stable, with no major fluctuations. The number of transactions in the morning market was 130,000 jiao (角), and the number of transactions in the afternoon market was 80,000 jiao (角). The price of copper coins was reduced by 1,000 wen, to 319,000 wen. The number of transactions was 31,262 strings, with a total value of $9,800.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Bulls Gradually Emerging</p>
<p>Public Bonds Mostly Up, Few Down</p>
<p>The Panic of Ninety-Six Has Passed: Gradually Lower Prices Seen in Each Transaction</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were rumors in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange and the market, but the matter has passed, and naturally there shouldn't be any problems. However, some have already emerged from the market, likely because they are like birds startled by the twang of a bow, easily frightened by shadows. Moreover, market prices are already high, and selling is actually a reasonable move. Sellers like numbers 21, 33, and 64 mostly closed out for profit. Numbers 4 and 56 showed a slight appetite for buying. Northern firms have already satisfied their demand and have comparatively sold off a little. The panic of ninety-six has passed, and prices have gradually fallen in each transaction, following the trend, dropping by one yuan and several jiao from the highest price. The overall trend is still sideways, and for the time being, there shouldn't be much turbulence. In yesterday's trading, short sellers quite a bit rolled over their positions at the opening, and number 21 sold off quite a bit. Market prices still rose slightly by one or two jiao. In the second transaction, number 64 emerged from the market, and number 4 bought in a bit. Rumors spread slightly in the market, but because the matter had passed, the rise was only a small two or three jiao. In the afternoon opening, the general trend continued with a slight increase of one or two jiao. Towards the end, demand from retail investors for the two types of securities remained strong, so they turned firm again. At closing, the general trend was slightly better by one or two jiao. The future is expected to continue to trade sideways for a while. The final result of market prices was that there were more rises than falls. The total volume of transactions was 14,025,000 yuan, with 30 shares of stock. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the comparative table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share).</p>
<p>U.S. Stocks Mixed, More Declines than Gains</p>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung &amp; Co., yesterday (the 8th) the New York stock market saw mixed results. The collapse of the French cabinet, coupled with sluggish commodity prices and profit-taking, caused prices to lose support. However, experts say the market's performance is quite good because, apart from a few stocks that have recently risen too much, causing significant fluctuations, the falls in other stocks were minimal. Trading in U.S. Steel shares was higher than other stocks because reports indicated that the automobile industry had orders and business was improving. The bond market rose. Stocks on the small exchange rose slightly but in a mixed fashion. Chicago wheat fell because of rumors of imported rye from abroad, causing rye to plummet and wheat to also fall. The total daily trading volume was 840,000 shares.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Both Bulls and Bears Waiting for Opportunity in Marked Yarn</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the situation appears somewhat stagnant. Trading in the market feels particularly quiet, with both bulls and bears waiting for an opportunity to move. In addition, sales of spot yarn continue unabated, and buyers are looking at higher prices. Because yarn stocks are shrinking, they are holding on tightly to this month's deliveries. The atmosphere of taking delivery is unusually strong.</p>
<p>Strong Demand for This Month's Yarn Deliveries. In the opening of the marked yarn market, market sentiment was relatively weak. Due to increased estimates for American cotton, market sentiment was slightly weak, and prices for all months fell by six or seven jiao. However, Tongcheng &amp; Co. continued to purchase at a limit price of 180 yuan for this month, and the market was held up by it. After two or three transactions, prices gradually rose again. Closing was slightly lower, resulting in near-term prices being flat and far-term prices falling by three or four jiao. In the afternoon opening, prices fell by three or four jiao due to the decline in gold prices. In the third transaction, it was heard that there were 2,000 bales of spot yarn traded, and buying interest was revived. As a result, prices for all months rose or fell by one, two, or three jiao. The total daily trading volume was 18,500 bales. Sales were: Tong Kee 300 bales, Ta Fung 650 bales, Yee Tai 350 bales, Kam Cheung 450 bales, Shun Kee 700 bales, Shun Yu 350 bales, Yuan Yi 300 bales, Cheung Fung 1,800 bales, and Tong Wo 750 bales. Purchases were: Cheung Yu 500 bales, Ming Tak 800 bales, Tat Kee 750 bales, Ta Fung 850 bales, Ta Foo 650 bales, Tai Cheung 600 bales, and Yan Fung 450 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Nearly 2,000 Bales of Spot Sales. Spot yarn sales remain good. Statistics show that various groups bought a total of 1,915 bales throughout the day. Market conditions are similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 334, Inland 405, Henan 50, Fellow Traders 240</p>
<p>Shantou 210, Northern Group 5, Tianjin 400, Sichuan 50</p>
<p>Yunnan 280, Fujian 10, Jiangxi 2</p>
<p>Market Sentiment for Marked Cotton is Relatively Soft</p>
<p>The cotton market shows a slight softening trend. Due to the U.S. cotton production estimate of 9,634,000 bales, an increase of 191,000 bales compared to the previous estimate, the market trend is favorable to short sellers, causing market sentiment to weaken slightly. However, buyers' determination remains firm due to the good yarn market. However, as gold prices trend downwards, demand from cotton mills has also become quieter.</p>
<p>Zheng Marked Cotton Reveals Signs of Softness. In the opening of the marked cotton market, due to the fourth U.S. cotton production estimate of 9,634,000 bales, an increase of 191,000 bales compared to the previous estimate, the market report favored sellers, causing market sentiment to weaken further. There were fewer buyers in the market. As a result, prices for all months fell by five fen to two jiao. The afternoon opening trended weaker. As gold prices fell further, market sentiment softened slightly. However, prices rose slightly by closing. As a result, prices for all months rose by five fen to one jiao. The total daily trading volume was 53,900 dan. Sales were: Tong Hing 2,600 dan, 吉豐 (Ji Feng) 1,000 dan, Ming Tak 800 dan, 森康 (Sum Hong) 900 dan, Yee Tai 1,200 dan, Cheung Fung 4,900 dan, Yun Hong 1,500 dan, and Cheung Wo 3,200 dan.

The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Demand from Raw Cotton Mills Weakens Again. Spot cotton sales have become quiet again, and demand from mills is slightly sluggish. The source is estimated to be 1,025 bales of Yao cotton and 1,945 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Stocks at the End of October in This City</p>
<p>Chinese, British, and Japanese Mills Sharply Reduced</p>
<p>Total Inventory 74,957 Bales</p>
<p>Down 15,823 Bales Compared to the End of September</p>
<p>According to a survey by a foreign firm in this city, cotton yarn inventory at the end of October was estimated at 74,957 bales, a decrease of 15,823 bales compared to the end of September. Japanese yarn accounted for 15,008 bales, a decrease of 2,527 bales compared to the end of September. British and Chinese yarn accounted for 59,849 bales, a decrease of 13,296 bales compared to the end of September. The reason for the decrease is due to increased consolidated taxes, as well as the imposition of export taxes and balancing taxes on silver. As a result, sales to customers in the South China region became more active. Purchases of Japanese yarn by India, Southeast Asia, Manchuria, and other places suddenly became strong. Due to these factors, the inventory of various yarns at the end of October was greatly reduced. The breakdown of yarn inventory by various mills is as follows:</p>
<p>(Unit: Bale) Bale Amount Yarn Type Bale Amount</p>
<p>4-count 1,100 20-count 48,221</p>
<p>6-count 1,006 32-count 4,105</p>

<p>Washington, November 9th. The U.S. Agricultural Adjustment Administration has developed a plan to reduce the acreage of cotton planting next year by 25% compared to the average of approximately 41 million acres in the past. This plan is likely to be endorsed by Secretary of Agriculture Wallace. The agency also stated that negotiations between the U.S. and Germany are underway to exchange 500,000 bales of U.S. cotton for German goods.</p>
<p>The 8th. Due to the government report favoring sellers, bulls closed out positions, and buyers decreased. Market conditions were flat and weak. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 6 to 10 points. English cotton futures rose by 3 to 5 points. Indian cotton rose due to purchases by European exporters. Bengal rose by 2.5 jiao, and Oomra and White Rose rose by 1.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 8th).</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Period Flour Rare and Listless</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the market for each month presented a uniformly flat and weak appearance. The quoted price of foreign wheat fell by four or five jiao in Chicago and two or three jiao in Canada, respectively. At the opening price, due to sluggish spot sales, speculative customers inside and outside the industry also reduced their interest due to the market's sluggishness. Therefore, transactions in each month were rare, and the market gradually showed weakness. Until the afternoon opening, transactions still did not improve, because buyers had no spirit, and the market fell by about one fen. Looking at the current situation, there is only hope for a rebound when spot sales are active. As a result, the current month fell by two fen compared to the previous day, December fell by two fen and two li and a half, January-February fell by two fen and a half, March fell by two fen and two li and a half, and April fell by one fen and seven li and a half.</p>
<p>Outside Buyers Return to Sell Period Wheat</p>
<p>After the opening of the period wheat market yesterday morning, each month presented a fixed but then quiet appearance. The quoted price of foreign wheat fell by about four or five jiao in Chicago and two or three jiao in Canada. At the opening, because there were very few transactions by people in the industry, and few outsiders entered or exited, most transactions were empty bids, and the market fluctuated little. Until the afternoon opening, due to the gradual sluggishness of the flour market, bulls outside the industry slightly returned to sell, and the market atmosphere appeared soft and loose. Considering the lack of improvement in flour sales, there may still be a slight fall. As a result, the current month fell by five fen, December fell by six fen, January fell by two fen, February fell by two fen, and March fell by six fen. The spot wheat market remains stable. Shandong Xuzhou wheat opened at 3.9 yuan, and Yaowan wheat opened at 3.88 yuan, a total of 12,000 bags, which were reportedly purchased by Shan Futung.</p>
<p>Imported Glutinous Rice Sells Well in Inland Areas</p>
<p>Imported Glutinous Rice Recovers by Two Jiao</p>
<p>Spot Imported Rice Up by Five Fen</p>
<p>Period Wheat Traders Hoard and Seek to Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday's imported glutinous rice market initially continued the weak trend of the previous day, with the market flat. Subsequently, inland groups suddenly arrived to actively purchase, with a very greedy appetite, especially welcoming imported glutinous rice. The price of imported glutinous rice had already risen, and the inventory was thin. The market then quickly turned upwards. Imported rice has always been mainly sold in this area. The appetite in this area had faded in the previous two days, and the market looked small. However, it was suddenly noticed by inland groups. Because the appetite in the inland areas was very greedy, and imported glutinous rice could not be purchased as desired, they then purchased imported rice. In addition to spot imported rice, there was also idle period imported rice. The market atmosphere completely changed. Imported glutinous rice, 机砶 (Ji Po) rough rice, and other rice all jumped by one and a half to two jiao. Imported rice inventory was two times more, but it only increased by five fen. Period imported wheat initially hoped to improve, but due to strong efforts to sell and the Baolong Foreign Firm soliciting the market, the asking price for February Gao Siam 邏機 (Luo Ji) rice was 5.52 yuan. Although no transaction was made, the market has already taken a hit, so the result was that period imported rice did not rise in the same way as imported glutinous rice and spot imported rice. Throughout the city, inland areas purchased 5,000 bags of imported glutinous rice, 1,500 bags of imported rice, and 2,550 tons of period rice. This area sold a total of 3,000 bags of Saigon and 机砶 (Ji Po) rough rice, it is said.</p>
<p>Rice Market Downriver, Quick Start Then Stagnation</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for each group was slightly scarce, with a total of over 30 firms arriving, carrying nearly 5,000 shih. The market was initially tight and then stagnant. At the start of the market, Yantai, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and other groups successively purchased various kinds of late rice, totaling over a thousand bags. Market conditions were tight, and cargo prices were raised. The local market in this area alone was still quiet. Afterwards, each group was very serious about their eating habits, firmly holding onto old positions, causing both sides to deadlock. As a result, the market was stagnant and unyielding. In the end, sellers made concessions, and various kinds of late rice improved slightly by several fen. However, the appetite for thick 新粳 (Xin Jing) rice and 野白稻 (Ye Bai Dao) was very strong, adding 2 or 3 jiao. However, the situation had already been affected by late rice and inevitably turned stagnant. Du Yang Jian also rose by over a jiao, while Yin Aiyuan had no glory.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, eighteen or nineteen ships arrived from each group downriver. The market for various goods such as 新粳 (Xin Jing) rice, 破粳 (Po Jing) rice, thin rice, 新羊 (Xin Yang) rice, Du Jian rice, and Chen Bai yuan rice continued to sell well in Futung. The later market gradually slowed. Chen Bai yuan rice was still vast. The sales of 新茂埠 (Xin Mao Bu) 客尖 (Ke Jian) rice were also good. The market for 新粳 (Xin Jing) rice was high, with good quality rice adding two or three jiao, and medium to lower quality adding one or two jiao. 破粳 (Po Jing) rice, 新杜尖 (Xin Du Jian) rice, Chen Bai yuan thin rice, and early rice added jiao in addition to the price. 新羊尖 (Xin Yang Jian) rice was flat and weak, Yin Yuan rice stood firm, and 新棹埠 (Xin Zhao Bu) 客尖 (Ke Jian) rice added nearly a jiao.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods</h3>
<p>Large Batch of Longan to Open Today</p>
<p>If the 什路 (Shi Lu) longan, such as the goods from Quanzhou, Tong'an, Anhai, and other places, arrive one after another, the total will be no less than 5,000 pieces. Because the appetite in the Shanghai market is slightly stagnant and land prices have risen instead, both the firms and the consignees have been holding off and have not opened. It is planned to gather the consignees and consignors together this morning to jointly evaluate the goods and open the market. If the opinions are not too far apart, it is expected that all the goods can be opened.</p>

<p>White Filature Has Supplementary Transactions</p>
<p>In the middle of the autumn competition, the exchange rates of British and French currencies have shrunk sharply. Because the exchange rates are favorable, European merchants have started taking the opportunity to replenish their shortage of white filature. However, overseas spot sales have not improved. I am afraid that this will be a fleeting phenomenon and will not last long. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and others imported 70 bales of spot white filature, all of which were supplementary transactions. The price is still firm.</p>

<p>Talks and Sayings</p>
<h3>Talking about Exaggeration</h3>
<p>— Yong Bo</p>
<p>Megalomania is actually bragging, and can also be called boasting.</p>
<p>Megalomania and authenticity are opposites. Once a fact is embellished and exaggerated, it will no longer be a true fact. Therefore, people who can exaggerate are definitely not honest people, and honest people will never exaggerate. Please understand clearly that it's not that they don't want to, it's that they can't. Therefore, we can say that exaggeration is actually an art.</p>
<p>For example, if you can't vividly describe a certain character or story in a twisted and moving way, making the listeners believe without doubt and not realize that your description is just a play on words that are three parts true and seven parts false, then you don't have the art of exaggeration. On the contrary, if you can speak vividly and people can listen believing without doubt, then you have succeeded in lying and have the art of exaggeration.</p>
<p>Speaking of lying, its meaning is different from that of exaggeration. Lying is fabricating a story to deceive people, while exaggeration is just expanding on a small story or adapting an ordinary story to make it more colorful.</p>
<p>Some people believe that when going out, you should always bring three parts bragging. They are afraid that strangers won't know how capable they are, so they want to show themselves, introduce themselves, and create an opportunity to brag about themselves. However, you have to have a sense of proportion when bragging. Speak human language in front of humans and ghost language in front of ghosts. The most important thing is to read people's expressions and change your course according to the wind. Otherwise, if you fart and blow the edge, you will be embarrassed on the spot, which is a very embarrassing thing!</p>
<p>Therefore, even if it's just three parts bragging, it still requires skill to brag, and this is the origin of exaggeration.</p>
<p>Youth is the period when people are most prone to the fault of megalomania, probably because of their youth and inexperience. The two types of people we are most likely to encounter day and night are: one is people who are engaged in political activities. When you meet them, you don't even need to ask them, and they will automatically tell you a series of exaggerated words from a certain member of the Central Committee or a certain chairman. Naturally, we can only laugh them off. The other type is the so-called literary youth, who also reel off a series of names of a certain writer or a certain writer. For those words, we can naturally only laugh them off as well.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, even if megalomania is not an extremely bad thing, it will never be a good thing. It can ruin things but not accomplish them!</p>
<h3>Banquet</h3>
<p>— Jia Chen</p>
<p>The hostess was busy greeting guests, darting back and forth like a shuttle. Even though it was a night in early winter with a slight chill, a few beads of sweat had already appeared on the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>In the house: white bed sheets, white whitewashed walls, and shimmering white mercury lights. She was wearing a white floral qipao. She seemed like a light and agile white feathered swallow. Today she should be so excited because today is her child's first birthday. She was so excited that she forgot she was a twenty-five-year-old mother. Tonight, she completely returned to the passionate state of a girl that she had lost since having a man. A kind of frivolous and uninhibited behavior. She casually patted the male guest on the shoulder and teased:</p>
<p>—Xiao Zhang, you should also have a woman. How can you always be single? Don't you feel lonely?</p>
<p>The one called Xiao Zhang pouted and made a funny face:</p>
<p>—It would be fine if you were willing to "hook up" with me.</p>
<p>Then a burst of bright laughter erupted. Not only did the hostess forget that she was a mother, but every guest also forgot that she was a woman who had a man. Everyone was talking and saying things without any restraint.</p>
<p>The male host, almost forgotten by his own woman and by the guests, was lying alone on a sofa by the window, smoking a cigarette very bored, watching the scene in front of him, and listening to what people were saying. An inexplicable emotion of doing evil climbed into his heart. He felt a little displeased. He felt that women shouldn't make that kind of almost licentious actions in front of him. Whether she was talking or not, she was still using her hand to touch the bodies of male guests, which was a bit too much to bear. And the male guests shouldn't be saying things that were almost over the line. But everyone was pulling and tugging freely and comfortably. Wasn't that simply a kind of contempt for him? In order to express the inherent respect of a man, he really wanted to say a few words, to give some hint, so that everyone would know that the male host was there and not act so recklessly. He moved his lips several times, but the words reached the edge of his mouth and then he swallowed them again. He didn't know how to say it. He couldn't say it. He felt a little flustered.</p>
<p>However, other people clearly didn't see him lying there, even his own woman.</p>
<p>It was only when everyone was seated that they started to discover him. They pulled him along in the same way. He took a seat without a trace of a smile. Then it came to the scene of drinking games again.</p>
<p>Only he couldn't muster any interest and didn't drink. But no one knew what was on his mind at this time. Only he himself understood.</p>
<p>But the people next to him still looked at him as if they couldn't see him, saying and doing whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>And the most energetic was still the hostess. She squinted with a peach-red smile, holding a cup in her hand, toasting this one and then toasting that one, one after another. Whenever someone was unwilling to drink, she would also start to use her hands, while bringing the cup closer to the man's mouth, and grabbing the man's neck, insisting that he drink it down....</p>
<p>The male host almost didn't have the courage to watch anymore. He wanted to snatch the cup in one breath, grab the woman and beat her, and drive all the male guests out, in order to vent the anger in his chest. But he couldn't do it no matter what. He could only think about it. And he had no choice but to turn his eyes away, sitting there enduring the torture.</p>
<p>The alcohol was put into his stomach and took effect. Everyone's eyes were red, looking a little drunk. Their voices were loud when they talked, more unbridled, and more losing their usual demeanor.</p>
<p>And then some people left their seats and started to foxtrot on the floor. Some people also opened their throats and sang songs loudly. Then someone proposed:</p>
<p>—Let's go dancing, okay?</p>
<p>This voice was still said by the hostess. Needless to say, everyone who answered said yes.</p>
<p>The way it looked, things were getting more and more wrong. The host's manhood was burning with anger. He had already endured to the point where he could no longer endure it. He stood in front of the woman and said with a tone of reproach:</p>
<p>—Don't be too indulgent. You should go back soon. The child at home is waiting for you.</p>
<p>After saying that, he didn't say goodbye to the others and strode out the door.</p>
<p>The woman didn't care at all.</p>
<p>The laughter and voices and the woman's melodious singing continued in the house.</p>

<h3>Morality and Life</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Lin Meiying and her companions were mercilessly loaded into a large black truck parked at the door by several people wearing the same style of azure clothing. At this time, she was really a bit confused. Where exactly were they taking her, and what was the reason for it?</p>
<p>The deep autumn night wind, pouring down from the three- or four-story roof, blew on Meiying's body, making her feel cold instantly. Even her bones felt vaguely cold, and she shivered.</p>
<p>Lin Meiying sat in the black truck. The truck moved forward, bumping constantly. She stared unblinkingly at the brightly lit electric lights of the shops along the road outside the wire mesh window, but her heart was very depressed, recalling the strange words that had been said by many spectators when she first got into the truck: "Catching wild chickens!" What exactly does "wild chicken" mean? It goes without saying that this term sounded very unfamiliar to Lin Meiying, who had just come from a bankrupt rural village. She wanted to speak out loud again and again to break this deathly silent and suffocating air, asking her sister Zhao Di who had come with her, but from the expression on each person's face, she could tell that they were all carrying a heavy heart, as if weighed down by a thousand pounds. Finally, she had no choice but to put this question aside for the time being.</p>
<p>Lin Meiying was an innocent, lively, and young country girl who had always been farming with her father in the countryside. However, she was always dreaming idealistically about prosperous Shanghai. She learned about the prosperous life in Shanghai from the neighbors who returned from Shanghai. At that time, her impression of Shanghai was simply like heaven. There was gold everywhere, and as long as she could get to Shanghai, all the problems of life could be solved. She thought to herself that these were not her fantasies. When she saw A Qiao, the daughter of the long-haired mother who was several years older than her, always wearing very beautiful clothes and bringing back many new and strange foods that she had never seen before every time she returned to her hometown from Shanghai, this was even more powerful proof of her ideal of Shanghai, which was like heaven.</p>
<p>Because of this year's unusually severe drought in the countryside, the autumn harvest was hopeless. Therefore, Lin Meiying and her elderly mother, with a hopeful heart, left the bankrupt rural village and fled to Shanghai, preparing to work as a maid for someone in Shanghai, or to work as a female worker in a factory.</p>
<p>However, things turned out contrary to Lin Meiying's expectations. After they arrived in Shanghai, they couldn't find work until now, and her elderly mother fell ill. Finally, for the sake of life, she had no choice but to put on a smiling face and sell her body and soul to ferocious men.</p>
<p>When the judge announced the date of detention in a heavy tone, a layer of black fog suddenly covered Lin Meiying's eyes. She seemed to see her elderly mother groaning on the sickbed, so she cried out with a "gua" sound and squatted weakly on the ground. She really didn't understand what was meant by hurting "morality," but what she knew was "life."</p>

<h3>My Father Forbids Me To Study</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>Indeed, I have always deeply believed that, in the</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>modernized Shanghai, women have the possibility of receiving considerable education. However, the reality is completely the opposite. Not only that, but some people even say: What education do women need? They can rely on their husbands for a living when they grow up; what's the use of being educated? Receiving some is of course fine, but it absolutely doesn't matter to the situation.</p>
<p>The fact is this: There is a father who already has seven or eight children. He is not very old; he is around forty this year. He says he is a person who welcomes new trends. He has a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old daughter who has not yet received a school education. However, because she is studious and works hard at self-study, she has now acquired considerable knowledge. Her eldest brother, wanting to prevent her from being bullied and suffering various hardships in the future, begged her father to allow her to receive some education. After several verbal battles, arguments, and struggles, the goal was finally achieved, but he only agreed to let her attend afternoon classes (from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM). However, she herself is very diligent. After finishing household chores every day, she always studies and writes until around 11:00 PM before going to bed. Her brother also guides her from time to time. Isn't that great? But her father, because he doesn't want her to pursue education, constantly undermines her... He often says to her brother: "Don't always expect your sister to study. You need to know that women can't make a living by studying! She (your sister) can rely on her husband when she grows up. And she'll have food to eat and things to use. What's the point of studying? So I've decided not to let her continue studying next year." Sir, please think about how infuriating these words are! He looks down on women too much! Does a woman necessarily have to be a parasite relying on her husband? But I know that in this evil society, it is terribly painful and dangerous for a woman not to receive considerable education! In this ever-changing and endlessly wicked Shanghai, I believe that women should receive some considerable education and strive for self-reliance, without having to rely on men. I read many divorce news stories in the newspapers every day. If these women were educated, then they could achieve self-reliance and wouldn't have to worry about anything. But if a woman is uneducated, then at such a time, thinking about the difficulties of future life is so painful and terrible! Alas! Won't these uneducated weaklings suffer various misfortunes because of the hardships of life? Therefore, for the sake of social happiness and for the sake of women's personal happiness, I am here to speak out on their behalf, and I hope that all parents in the world can realize this point and give them all the opportunity to study. That would truly be a great blessing for society. Finally, if you, sir, can use your intelligent eyes and mind to give me a satisfactory answer, I would be infinitely grateful. I respectfully wish you</p>
<p>Peace,</p>
<p>Shi Yinghong</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After reading Ms. Shi's letter, we express our infinite sympathy and hope for her. We also know that there are many fathers whose thinking is even more stubborn than Ms. Shi's father. This is not just a personal issue of pursuing education, but one of the most important issues in the entire women's liberation movement – women's education. Therefore, Ms. Shi, in addition to asking for help within the family, should move forward with an indomitable spirit, and never feel hopeless because your father's thinking is stubborn. If you have even a little strength, you must do your best. If every woman can do this, there is hope for the future of women's liberation! As for the family aspect, you can entrust your brother or a close friend trusted by your father to gently persuade him. With deep affection, I think there may be a chance of success. If persuasion is ineffective, then you don't have to be discouraged. There are still many ways to study on your own. You can also participate in the Shanghai News Circulation Library's reading guidance department and ask them for help.</p>

<p>(2) White Army Comrade</p>
<p>The big black guy gritted his teeth, glared his eyes, and strained his back, following those three guys to climb several more mountain peaks, entering a broken village. There were many people coming and going in the village, and many guys in tattered military uniforms were busy.</p>
<p>The women all had their hair cut, and their half-bound feet were all liberated. Their faces all showed an indescribable smile! There were also some holding small red flags, in groups of three or five, shouting. The big black guy felt like he had entered another country, and everything looked a bit strange!</p>
<p>The men and women were all mixed together, talking and laughing. Old ladies were also hurriedly busying themselves. A group of guys in tattered military uniforms surrounded a dozen or so young women with delicate features, pulling and teasing them.</p>
<p>The big black guy forgot that his flag-pole legs were sore, and his big eyes kept looking around. When he walked into the middle of the village, suddenly four or five women ran towards him. They were all dressed very smartly, wearing blue cloth half-length jackets with green cloth shawls on their shoulders. They swarmed around the big black guy.</p>
<p>"Welcome, newly arrived White Army comrade..."</p>
<p>"This big black guy has a really good build!"</p>

<p>Ms. Bingmei's Tang Poetry</p>
<p>Huaxing (1260) 9:00 AM</p>
<p>Song of the Daughter of Luoyang</p>
<p>The daughters of Luoyang live across the street,</p>
<p>Barely past fifteen years.</p>
<p>Her husband rides a dappled horse with jade reins,</p>
<p>Her maidservants serve sliced carp on golden platters.</p>
<p>Painted pavilions and red buildings face each other,</p>
<p>Red peach blossoms and green willows hang toward the eaves.</p>
<p>Embroidered curtains are sent up to the seven-fragrance carriage,</p>
<p>Precious fans welcome her back to the nine-layered canopy.</p>
<p>The reckless man's wealth and status are in his youth,</p>
<p>Competing in extravagance, surpassing Ji Lun.</p>
<p>She pities herself, like Bi Yu personally teaching dance,</p>
<p>Not begrudging coral to give to others.</p>
<p>At dawn, the spring window extinguishes the nine faint flames,</p>
<p>Each faint flame moves the flower lock.</p>
<p>After playing, she has no leisure for ritual music,</p>
<p>When made up, she just sits perfuming.</p>
<p>All acquaintances in the city are rich and prosperous,</p>
<p>Passing by the Zhao and Li families day and night.</p>
<p>Who pities the Yue girl with a face like jade,</p>
<p>Washing silk by herself at the poor Qiantang River.</p>

<p>Sorry, today we are broadcasting "Man Jiang Hong"!</p>
<p>Although we published the explanation of "The Cat for Crown Prince" yesterday, everyone should know, right? Yesterday was the anniversary of the death of our patriotic martyr Mr. Pan Hongsheng, so we specially broadcast "Night of January 28th" to express sympathy and respect! Today, the story of "Man Jiang Hong" begins, which is also a sudden change to accept the opinions of the majority of listeners. The beginning of "Man Jiang Hong" is: "A lonely steamer carries a wandering artist - Yu Shuicun!"</p>
<h3>Storytelling</h3>
<p>Yao Xiao'an Pang Xueqing Pearl Tower</p>
<p>Zhongxi (1040) 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Lamenting Spring"</p>
<p>The rising sun shines on the small pavilion.</p>
<p>The noble lady in the painted tower loves to sleep in spring.</p>
<p>The birds chirping across the courtyard startled the remaining dream.</p>
<p>Sitting and embracing the lonely quilt to avoid the morning cold.</p>
<p>Her cloud-like hair is disheveled and about to fall.</p>
<p>The rouge from the previous night has faded from her face.</p>
<p>Her three-inch golden lotus flowers are embroidered all over.</p>
<p>The silk quilt illuminates her small knees with a red tip.</p>
<p>She raises her body and slowly arranges her clothes.</p>
<p>The wind sways her waist as she walks lightly.</p>
<p>Opening the window, she first hangs the pearl curtain in spring.</p>
<p>But she only sees the stamens containing buds, blurred by the morning dew.</p>
<p>The heartless spring birds flutter in the morning mist.</p>
<p>Jade-bridled horses neigh in the fragrant grass.</p>
<p>People in jade towers are drunk in the apricot blossoms.</p>
<p>The boundless spring mood disturbs people.</p>
<p>Let's ask the dressing table to comb half of her hair.</p>
<p>She loves orchids but doesn't insert idle flower buds.</p>
<p>Floating temples wear jade hairpins.</p>
<p>Facing the mirror, she pities her beauty that could overthrow a country.</p>
<p>Holding on without saying a word, she secretly feels affection.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, good flowers wither early.</p>
<p>The bright moon has never been full for long.</p>
<p>The days when the moon is full and the flowers are good are not many.</p>
<p>How can a person ever be young again when old?</p>
<p>Why bother laboring to hoard money?</p>
<h3>Special Programs</h3>
<p>Mao Zhizhong Art Lecture Seat</p>
<p>Hangyun (1180) 2:00 PM</p>
<p>"Oil painting, watercolor painting, pencil painting, lectures"</p>
<p>"Stories of Modern Western Art Writers"; Gu Ge. At first, he worked as a clerk in an art store. Because he often talked endlessly to customers about the meaning of religious paintings, he was fired. He went to England to work as a primary school principal for a few months; later, he returned to Holland to work as a priest. Feeling bored, he went to Belgium to work as a miner. Because he was too sympathetic to the laboring class, he was suspended by the authorities. Finally, he thought of expressing his regrets through painting. Unable to make a living, he was helped by his brother. Gu went to southern France to sketch, and his brain became abnormal from the scorching sun, resulting in a strange love affair. (One day, he joked with a waitress in a cafe, saying, "Okay, what do you want? I'll give you anything!" The woman jokingly replied, "I want your ears." On the day before Christmas, that waitress received a package. When she opened it, it turned out to be Gu's ears. She couldn't help but feel pain, and they became husband and wife. Soon after, they fell into a tragic situation, and he finally committed suicide with a pistol). (Omitted)</p>
