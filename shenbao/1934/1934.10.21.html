<p>就數日來南匈二國之緊張狀態觀之。固有戰爭一觸卽發之可能惟揆諸事實。二國邦交之欠佳。由來已久。今日雙方之緊張狀態。要爲過去互相敵視猜嫌累積之結果。以是每一不幸事件發生。國民心理。遂立卽以之懷疑對方。於是事態眞相尙未查明。國民已有憤慨之表示。我人苟將南匈二國過去之不良關係略一研究。卽可恍然於此種心理之所以形成矣。蓋大戰以前。奧匈對於斯拉夫人。常採分化政策。而對克羅特人與塞爾維亞人之結合。尤爲嫉視。故於塞人克羅特人之間。挑撥離間。無所不用其極。如奧皇儲富迪南大公。更有組織奥匈克三族帝國以壓抑斯拉夫人之計劃。結果遂使克羅特人比較的親近奥匈。而與其同族之塞人。反生隔閡。此其互相猜嫌之原因一。迨夫歐戰爆發。多數克羅特人。復供匈人驅使。與塞人相見於疆塲。至一九一七年。雖相約合併。然塞克之間。終難無所芥蒂。而匈克之間亦不無有所戀戀。此其二及與塞合併以後。充分自治之幻夢。日爲大塞爾維亞主義所摧毁。於是其亡命之徒。以匈境爲逋逃藪。匈人從而利用之。自爲情理之常。卽無事實證明。亦難袪南人之疑。且兇黨機關。設於其境。而佯爲不知。究於國際道義上說不過去。此其三。加以脫刺農和約簽訂以來。匈人常以修約爲要圖。此在凡爾賽系統下之小恊約與南斯拉夫。自極感覺不安。而以意奧匈結合後爲尤甚。心理上旣已如是。則神經自易感受刺激。此其四。又據今春兩國訴諸國聯之爭端而觀。卽知此三年來匈人確曾縱容南國恐怖黨之活動。南人亦曾殺害匈人十五名。如是而欲兩國之互相信任。自屬難能。此其五。有此五端。更復益以今日亞歷山大之被刺。雖欲南人不疑匈人之故意縱容。亦烏可得。且於此法意力謀接近之秋。克人之舉。固在乘機破壞。卽匈人於此。亦不無發縱指使之嫌疑。故南人對匈之憤慨。實爲應有之行動。</p>
<p>唯戰爭能否因是而起。實非南匈二國所能决定。在南斯拉夫與小恊約。對此事當贍法國馬首。在今日之匈牙利。則須依意大利之意志爲從違。意苟不願爲之撑腰匈人殊無對南强硬之力量。往者墨索里尼。常唱修改和約之論調此一主張。苟能貫澈到底。則今日之事。未可逆料。孰知意奧匈三國恊定成立之時。墨氏於此一點。力避爲明確之聲明。而近數月來。更絕口不談。是則匈牙利之修約問題。法理上墨氏並無援助之必要義務。易詞以言。今日之事。匈牙利殊難盼望意之援助也。此其一。再則近年以來。阿爾巴尼亞。日益仇意。意人於巴爾幹。旣失此一前哨。則自難進窺南斯拉夫。此其二。三則巴爾幹公約成立而後。南國地位較固。四則因對德立塲之相同。意人亟欲與法修好前時所傳之法意恊定。與南王之訪法。皆爲法意關係意南關係轉好之步驟。更觀今日墨氏對南態度之容忍。可知其意仍在力謀增進法意法南之邦交。藉以奠定歐洲之和平。故由此數點而觀。意大利决不至於助匈以敵南匈無意助。則對南雖不慊於心。自必多方隱忍以維和平。故於今而大戰之爆發。顯屬過早也。</p>
<p>據最近電訊。小恊約對於馬賽慘案。認爲國際罪惡。對匈將提抗議或將訴諸國聯。同時匈外長。亦擬進見墨索里尼云云。意者匈人以事態嚴重。故特徵詢墨氏以如何應付之方。若我人以前之觀察而果無大誤。則墨氏自必隱勸匈人以息事寗人之道。而其方法。亦不外自今而後。匈人對於克羅特人之恐怖機關。嚴加取締而已。</p>

<p>甘省有一織呢廠、原稱織呢總局、爲淸光緖初年左宗棠督甘時所創設、開辦費爲銀二百萬兩、後歸蘭山道府彭英甲繼辦、以生産不旺、開支過鉅、逐漸虧蝕、竟至停辦、嗣由地方紳士鄧隆等、集資組織、官商合辦、改稱織呢公司、但無切實之整頓方法、未久又告歇業、民國十五年、省政府收回續辦、産銷兩不發達、至十九年、又告結束、並將該廠機件、劃歸建廳保管、二十年四月、省府擬撥欵恢復之、终以省庫支絀、未能實現、二十一年曾由建設廳、擬訂招商合辦之法、又以受地方金融影響、殷户鉅商、未敢投資、使該廠生機頓絕、恢復難期、今建廳以本省牧畜蕃殖、羊毛産量豐富、織呢廠之恢復、爲事實上之要圖、日前除呈請省府、撥欵復興外、並委派技術人員、督匠修理機件、俾得早時恢復、以資振興實業、</p>
<p>交通爲一切建設之肇始、故開發西北、羣論所歸、仍多側重於交通、甘省交通、素稱閉塞、舉凡工商各業、皆因而落後、當局爲積極推進建設起見、特先擬定修築全省公路計劃、計分六大幹綫、一曰甘陜綫、自臯蘭經榆·定西·靜寗·隆德·平凉·涇川·至窰店、二曰甘新綫·自臯蘭·經永登·古浪·武威·永昌·山丹·張掖·臨澤·髙台·酒泉·玉門·安西·至猩猩峽、三曰甘靑綫·自臯蘭·至享堂、四曰甘寗綫、自臯蘭·經靖遠·至中衛、五曰甘川第一幹綫、自臯蘭·沿甘陜綫之孟家堡·經通渭·秦安·天水·成縣·至成都、六曰甘陜第二幹綫、自臯蘭·經洮沙·臨潭·岷縣·西固·武都·至碧口等是、現除蘭州至西安至西寗·至安西·至寗夏·勉可通行汽車外、餘名借用大車道、亟須根本興築、</p>
<p>甘省居黄河上流、土地廣闊·惟以髙原苦旱、無法灌漑、荒漠千里、補救維艱、甘省人口六百數十萬、務農者當佔十之八九、此輩無辜良民、無怪時感旱災、顧救濟之道、不外濬河渠·治溝洞·使仰髙之地、得受灌漑、於是磽瘠均成沃壤、民生得以解决、而於治理黄河前途、亦不無補益也、茲將甘省水利槪况、分述如次、</p>
<p>（一）雨量、甘省氣候枯燥、旱災頻仍、全年雨量、雖無精確測定、然就最近調查所得、中路各地約十八吋、（蘭州全年雨量據實測約只十一吋）東路約十五吋、南路約二十吋、西路約十六吋、但據上海徐家匯天文台、委託測候之蘭州天主、負責人云、甘肅每年平均雨量、只三英吋、（按普通雨量在十八英吋以下者、已不能豐收、須以灌漑輔助）、其不數農田之用、至爲明顯、倘不從事水利灌漑、多種森林、以調和氣候、增加雨量、·則甘省農田、將成赤地也無疑、</p>
<p>（二）河流、長江以北各巨川、皆經過甘肅省境、如黄河·涇·渭·洮·漢·漳·汭·黨·沙·淸水·黑水·大通·莊渡·龍潭·疏勒·臨·郭·白亭·環江·東·北·諸沙·以及嘉陵·白龍·兩江等、縱橫參差、幾若蛛網、惟水流湍急、　於開渠引水、故秦漢以後、屯田渠道之遺跡、在在可考、</p>
<p>（三）水車、甘省附近各縣、間有建築水車、以作引水灌漑工具者、然費力旣鉅、成效甚微、各縣現有水車數、爲永靖五三輛、灌田九·六三九畝、靖遠二四輛、灌田一○·八○○畝、臯蘭一七六輛、灌田二九·七一○畝、洮沙一輛、灌田一○○畝、總計二五四輛、灌田五○·二四九畝、</p>
<p>（四）已成水渠、臨洮縣計有德遠·工賑·永寗·富民·新民·洮惠·枊林·好水·結河·改河·八洋·崔灣·等十二渠、天永縣僅有通惠渠、由該縣上峽口南灣、設閘開渠、引導渭水、至下峽口黑窰灣上、長六千公尺、灌田一千餘畝、其他各縣、因係水渠其名未詳、總計全省已成水渠約有一百七十餘道、灌田約二百餘萬畝、</p>
<p>（五）未成水渠、臨洮縣計有溥濟·濟生·抺挪·東峪·等四渠、永靖縣計有永豐川·喇嘛川·等渠、該兩縣未成水渠、將來開濬完成、可灌漑農田九萬餘畝、</p>
<p>（六）　擬開濬水渠、臨洮縣計有民生·安川·等渠、臯蘭有新古、達家川·等渠、武威有淘蜡·硯泔·二訶渠、隴西縣有隴西南渠、景泰有黑馬圈河渠、永登有紅古城渠、平涼有平涼川渠、川有涇河·　河·兩渠·天水有渭河河堤、導引隴河、靜寗有苦水河渠、以上各縣、未成及擬築各渠、若能全部完成、總計約需工程費一百七十萬元之譜、可灌漑六十餘萬畝之農地、每畝每年、以增益三元計算、每年農民收益總數、在二百萬元以上、對此農村經濟、日益凋敝之趨勢、何殊得一起死回生之良藥、而復使其欣欣向榮也、</p>

<p>本年增設鄭許商業郾舞等線</p>
<p>開封通信、豫省長途電話　以近年政局穩定、匪患敉平、逐漸架設、截至去年底止、幹支線路、計有五十九條、長八千二百三十餘里、頃據該局長于澤侯談、今年已架修鄭許綫、完成商業綫、添架郾舞·信武·南淅·等三線、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>鄭許線　　開封至許昌間、原設有話綫一條、計長一百八十里、惟係附掛電報桿上、因兩綫路感應力甚强、致話音多有淆混、且以電報局催移線路甚急、及按照原綫路另樹新桿、重掛新線、以免再有　音之弊、本局當派鄭州分局長郭景岐、率工於本年三月一日開工架設、至三月十六日、全線完成、通話以來、異常淸晰、</p>
<p>商葉綫　商城至葉家集、相距爲一百四十華里、曾於二十二年十一月派潢川分局長劉善成率工架設、自是月三十日起興工、至十二月十五日架至武廟集、嗣因匪共竄擾、中途停工、至本年三月六日、乃繼續架設、至三月二十日全綫完成、惟該處匪氛未靖、維護甚難、近據報告、該綫又爲匪共所破壞、</p>
<p>郾舞綫　由漯河（即郾城）經過舞陽至葉縣、計程一百六十里、原定架設長途電話、所需料欵、按經由各縣里數、平均分攤、乃因葉縣應攤料欵、迄未繳到、本局當派開封南關營業處主任張增榮率工、於本年六月六日開工、先將郾城至舞陽一段設修、至六月十五日、該段綫路完成、開始通話、一俟葉縣將應攤料欵繳齊、即可繼續架設、以完成郾舞葉之全綫、</p>
<p>信武線　信陽至武勝關爲程一百零五華里、由武勝關以南、即入湖北省境、爲奉令完成豫鄂聯綫、以利通訊起見、當於本年六月、派辦事員謝紹忱率工、於是月十四日興工架設、至七月二日全綫告成、與　之廣水接通、現信陽至漢口間、已可直接通話、</p>
<p>南淅綫　同南陽經鎭平内鄕至淅川長途電話之架設、係應剿匪需要、以與湖北省均州聯接俾消息得以靈通、除南陽至鎭平一段、本局原已架有綫路外、計由鎭平至内鄕爲九十華里、内鄕至淅川爲一百四十華里、因凖備與均州聯線、故至淅川後復架至本省邊境之小賽嶺、計四十華里、本局派開封南關營業處主任張增榮率工架設、自本年七月二十二日興工、至九月十三日完成、因湖北省之均州境内綫路尙未架成、故兩省聯線通話、尙有待也云云、（十八日）</p>

<h3 id="c136">外滙平市委員會昨起實行穩定匯兌 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>基金分配四四二制</p>
<p>營業虧耗財部補助</p>
<p>申時社云、財政部會同中央中國交通三銀行、組織外匯平市委員會、自前日具體决定原則後、所有工作步驟、自前日晚間起、已由貝淞蓀·席德懋·張佩紳·三代表多次密談决定、以該項工作、係無一定形式、須臨時隨機應變、開始進行時、將由三方面隨時商决辦理、至組織及細則、已由貝淞蓀草擬完竣、俟今日交中央交通兩行再加一度商討後、正式通過、至該委員會之基金一萬萬元、已决定由中央·中國·各擔任四千萬元、交通銀行擔任二千萬元、將來隨需要情形、隨時在規定限制内、向各銀行提撥、遇必要時、基金總額得隨時商洽伸縮、</p>
<h3 id="c137">財部負擔補助虧耗 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>此次銀行合組外匯平市委員會、完全係受財部監督與委託、但其營業活動上、則爲獨立性質、而其工作方針、亦與一般商業性質者不同、故將來如在特别情形下、蒙受損失、爲維持市面安定計、亦所不惜、惟該項損失、財部方面已允予補助、又據銀行界一般視察、則謂該項平衡外匯工作、如處理得法、將不致有虧耗、</p>
<h3 id="c138">平匯委會主要機能 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>又據昨晨熟識匯兌趨勢之某銀行家向記者談、外匯平市委員會成立後、其主要之機能、一方係爲穩定國内銀市、使不致有驟然上昇或下落之情形、卽遇銀元價格下跌時、平匯會卽買進銀元賣出美金或先令、使銀價抬高、反之如銀元暴漲、卽放出銀元、而買進美金及先令、以壓低其暴漲程度、以期銀市與匯價、常保持適當之程度、又據另一銀行家觀察、預料政府將壓低國内幣價、以致與美元五比一之比例、以帮助國産物之外銷、惟恐若突然銀元價格暴落時、我出口商勢必不利、故將利用外匯平市委會、使逐漸進行、而免有特殊之影響云、</p>
<h3 id="c139">華商銀行表示贊同 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>財部此次組外匯平市委員會、其組織份子、原擬除中央中國交通三銀行外、尙包括其他華商銀行參加、故前晨由孔財長召集會議時、上海銀行陳光甫·浙江實業銀行李馥蓀·等亦曾參加討論、茲以某種原因、始最後决定、單由中央等三銀行會同組織、據申時社記者昨晨訪問各華商銀行領袖、則均表示政府此種辦法、在匯兌營業上、雖私家華商銀行方面、將稍受影響、惟在整個中國金融市面着想、咸一致表示贊同、並謂外匯平市工作如能確實做去、預料必能收得相當完滿之效果、至外商銀行方面、則多不願有所意見表示、</p>

<h3 id="c141">財界要人闢謠 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>通貨膨脹並非事實</p>
<p>减低幣値亦無其事</p>
<p>自財政部加徵白銀出口稅後、物價驟見上漲、各交易所買賣非常活潑、星期四日、金價漲至一千零二十元、其他紗花麥粉亦來巨大漲風、但以現貨之求供、與市塲之交易相對照、似覺距離尙遠、皆緣謠傳我國亦將减低幣値、膨脹通貨、或卽改用金本位制、遂視買進標金外匯或其他物品爲致富捷徑、以致市况發生劇變、經星期五日、各報登載財部負責發言人所聲稱、釋明政府並不廢止銀本位、亦非禁銀出口、頓將廢銀用金之謠、一掃而空、詎昨又聞頗有發爲减低幣値、以膨脹通貨之揣測者、人心復爲之不安、記者以此詢諸某銀行家、據云、頃晤見財界要人、亦曾以此叩詢、現已深悉减低幣値、膨脹通貨、决無其事、邇日謠傳雖多、皆一般投機者猜測之詞、不足置信也云云、</p>

<p>共有二十餘萬元</p>
<p>爲荷蘭銀行所付</p>
<p>自江海關奉令徵收白銀出口稅後、十六日本埠外商銀行大批出口銀洋、均停止出口、紛紛退關、提回各行存儲、唯荷蘭銀行、在徵稅令頒布後、仍裝載白銀一批出口、數目無多、共計在二百萬元左右、該行先繳納二五出口稅、繼及補繳七五與五二五新稅、共計付出補納之新稅洋十七萬數千元、合已納之二五稅、共約計二十萬元以上、海關收取此稅率後、乃准予該行白銀運美、此爲白銀徵收平衡稅後之第一批運出上海、亦爲江海關頒布徵收銀稅以後之第一次巨額稅欵收入也</p>

<p>主席王正廷氏致詞、略謂、今日召開十四屆徵求大會、蒙諸位參加、很榮報、本人覺得今天參加人員很多、亦可表示我們恊力的表現、交通事業是帮助國家建設最重要的工作、而交通建設方面、尤莫重于道路之建設、故有全國道路恊會的成立、以警醒全國民衆對道路建設的認識、在道路恊會成立之初、全國公路僅一千公里、至最近爲止、各省公路建設已擴充至九萬七千公里、可見道路建設進行和宣傳的必要、其次對於今後如何繼續推進以及修養道路·保護道路的工作、就是現在第二步最需要進行的事業和責任、蓋造路之功能、不但對於防匪·軍事上均有便利、即在經濟上亦有莫大的好處、如最近的江西、對於造路均有很大的進步、而赤匪亦因此無所施展、總之、我們只要同志多、其事就易發達至成功云云、</p>

<p>總理在過去曾辭去大總統的任務、而就全國鐵路督辦的事、可想見先總理對於道路建設的重視、本人數年前在山西本省的時候、因深感於山西交通的不便、及民衆行路的困難、與經濟上損耗的重大、所以便向閻百川主席建議修建道路、閻主席亦覺築路的重要、便開始令飭兵工築路、以利民行、其後本人到上海、便與王儒堂先生等、共同組織全國道路恊會、以提倡造路運動、現在全國道路已逐漸興築、目前需要者爲如何修養道路和改良道路、而特别重要的是汽車和汽油的來源問題、因爲我們如果有公路、而缺乏汽車和汽油、仍屬不成、所以我們應注意現在我們如何造汽車、自己供給汽車的燃料、來挽回權利、所以爲要達到以上所說的目的、一方面要積極的把造路的重要使一般多數民衆知道、同時並須積極培植專門人才、以解决發展中國交通的根本問題、這才是提倡道路建設的整個意義云、</p>
<h3 id="c180">褚民誼詞 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>汪院長代表褚　民誼演詞云、誰都知道要振興國家建設、則交通建設是特别重要的工作、所以本人認爲要建設中國、便要從建設交通做起、因之中華全國道路建設恊會的成立、和工作的進行、是具有重大意義的、關於公路築成後之交通工具問題、本人以爲在中國自己不能製造汽車、自己沒有汽油的時候、提倡馬車是唯一補救的辦法、因爲在内地鄕村、馬車確是種比較適合的交通工具、不過提倡馬車並不是開倒車、因爲這猶好像我們平素吃貫魚翅海參、必要的時候、就吃些靑菜荳腐、這一點希望大家要明瞭、提倡馬車、在中國確是有許多優點云、</p>

<p>— 周予同</p>
<p>在理想的通史還沒有出現以前，二十四史自有牠的存在的價値。二十四史的篇幅是那樣的多，條理當然不見得怎樣完善，可是沒有辦法，我們對於歷史要知道得詳細一點，總得請敎到牠。我們不能用了我們現在的眼光去責備歷代編史的人，說他們只知道死守着司馬遷和班固的成法，依樣畫葫蘆地編出一代一代的史書來，要知道在封建制度的社會裏、只有這樣的史書是適應的産物。</p>
<p>從另一方面說，二十四史確然成爲一個完整的系統，並不是漫無意義的結集。雖說是紀傳體，然而大部分有「志」「表」等。各史缺少這些部分的，經歷代學者補編增訂，差不多齊全了。把二十四史裏的作爲骨幹，再把增補的湊合上去，就是一部很豐富的文化史。再說二十四史裏有着重複的部分，最顯著的自然是五代史和新五代史，唐書和新唐書。這重複並不是徒然誇耀繁多，大槪新的立意在乎修正，而有了新的，就此廢棄舊的，也失掉參看互證的益處，所以兼收並列自有牠的意義。</p>
<p>明代編修元史，工作非常潦草，當時參與其事的人不通蒙古文，對於元代的典章文物不很了了，只是胡亂鈔錄一陣，以致舛誤百出。一般的批評都說各史中間元史最是荒蕪，就引起一班學者研究或改造元史的動機。研究元史的有錢大昕，李文田，洪鈞，丁謙，張相文等，他們的著作對於元史都有修訂之處，但只是部分的。意欲改造元史的有邵遠平，魏源，屠寄等，屠寄的蒙兀兒史雖經刋行，但不曾全部完成，邵遠平的元史類編和魏源的元史新編也只是「長編」的工作，至多和王鴻緖的明史稿相當。柯紹忞的新元史成書最後。這部書取材精博，立例謹嚴，和元史的草草完成正相反背。雖然陳垣批評說與其改造元史，不如給元史作注作補，像裴松之注三國志，褚少孫補史記一般，其實這個話也是所謂「責備賢者」的意思。道部書比起新五代史和新唐書來，豈止「絕無媿色」而已。開明書店把牠歸入二十四史的系統，合成二十五史，可以說是確當不移的。</p>

<p>— 呂思勉</p>
<p>來敎懷疑於魏柯兩家之書，孰爲適用，此不足疑也。正史之在今日，已不盡供恒人閱讀之資，而特以備專家取材之用。供恒人閱讀者病其繁，而供專家取材者求其備。二者自唐以後，其勢已不可得兼。古代史料少，治史者見解亦粗，事之有關係無關係，則以意去取而已矣。故其所成之書，不能甚繁，一朝開創之後，所修前代之史，卽可供凡人之閱讀。後世情形旣異，則史材恒苦其多。編纂時割棄之則有所不忍，盡存之則繁不可讀。論史裁者，所以斤斤爭議於繁簡之間，而卒無　策，卽由於此（論者或不自知，然實係此種情勢迫之於後也）。於斯時也，保存材料之書，與供恒人閱讀之書，本宜析爲兩事。然此理直至章實齋出，而見之始瑩。前此作史者，率皆裴回於二者之間，此其下筆時之所以甚苦。然與其過而廢之，毋寧過而存之，人人皆有此想，此又正史之所以不期其繁而日趨於繁。然後來專研史學之家，所以有所取資者，則正受此漸趨於繁之賜也。柯書之長，卽在其備。元史改作，久有其人。訂補之家，尤屬不少。所據之書，或多或寡，所立之說，或是或非。治此史於今日，不徒病舊史之蕪，亦且苦史以外之材料過多，而不易網羅，史以外之衆說紛紜，而難於去取。柯書於此，采摭旣勤，折衷亦愼。得此，則舊史之所遺，後人之所訂，不啻具備於二百數十卷之中，此其所以似繁而實簡也。魏書體例雖新，所載失之太簡。且皆百年前舊說，不徒洪文卿以後，借資西史者，一無所有，卽史材之存於域内者，采摭亦多未備。舍柯書而讀魏書，其餘諸書豈容不及？則求簡而反繁矣。僕之得讀柯書，尙係初出時，假諸邑前輩屠敬山先生者。涉獵粗竟，先生問僕：「意謂如何？」僕未敢對，還以問諸先生。先生云：「此書之長，卽在其蒐采之博，使治此史者，可省許多精力耳。」竊喜其所見之同。先生又問：「柯書旣奉明令，列於學官，則正史中唐五代元，皆有兩種並列，學人日力，或苦不給，旣有所興，能有所替否？」僕對：「正史相緮緟者，實尙不止此數。史漢同異，詞句爲多，卽未齊梁陳魏北齊周隋之書之於南北史亦然，且本有此缺而以彼補之者。但得善校勘者，據其一，而以他一之異同備注於下，則其一可省矣。新舊唐五代，事實同異太多，卽其同者，辭句亦皆大異，斷宜並存。若舊元史，則其所有者，殆不能出新史以外，得其新，舊者殆可廢也。」先生亦以爲然。此事忽逾十年，而先生亦久歸道山矣，述之懀然。</p>

<p>— 顧歆剛</p>
<p>二十四史，寒駿之力所難得。同文書局石印本，視殿本廉甚矣，尙須二百餘圓。今則商務印書館集印古本，豫約亦三百圓。能讀書者恒無購買力，其有力購買者乃多取作陳設之用，需要與供給不相稱，幾若天生之缺陷然，思之歎息。今開明書店以鋅版印二十五史，字小而明，且附有參考書目及人名索引，卷帙增多，檢索愈便，而售價彌減，其有益於學者何限。倘能本此志而擴充之，自尙書，左傳以迄東華錄，淸史稿，更打破昔人正史之觀念，將向時稱爲霸史之十六國春秋，十國春秋等，稱爲别史之契丹國志，大金國志等，以及紀事本末，會要諸書集於一編，顔曰中華百史，則其貢獻于學術界者，功將什倍于此。年來國人受時代之刺戟，思建立民族主義之基礎，羣欲得一中國通史而讀之，而苦於無其書。此固由個人才力所不及，亦材料不能集中有以致之。開明書店同人有志闡揚文化，甚願就此發軔，猛着先鞭，努力於蒐集史書，編製索引。至于分析材料，使依類别，考訂異同，使歸一是，是固吾儕之責。如此十年，必有以饜國人之望矣。</p>
<p>編者謹按：顧先生把廣羅史料的責任期勉我們，要我們從「二十五史」發軔，廣爲「中華百史」，這是何等的厚意！我們對於顧先生的期勉，當然樂於承受。但廣羅史料而從輯印「二十五史」發軔，關於這一點，外面尙有懷疑之論，也有寫信來商榷的，這實在有明白述說的必要。查我國載籍極博，所有的書本，從廣義說，差不多盡是歷史的資料，卽就四部分類說，光是史部一項，也就羣分類别，五花八門，舉不勝舉了，我們對此龐雜的史籍，如要做一番編集的工作，當然不能漫無標凖，隨便亂湊。可是各人有各人的主觀，這標凖也就很難確定。在這標凖沒有公定以前，歷來的官本「正史」却是代用的標凖。「正史」旣是代用的標凖，那麽今日的初步工作只有輯印「二十五）史」了。如果我們現在仍只印二十四史而遺漏了「新元史」，不但違背了這代用的標凖，而且大有時代落伍之感。如果不照顧先生所詔示的那樣有意義，有統系地分類廣輯，那麽就是二百五十史；二百六十史也儘管拉湊得出，但是，這還成甚麽話呢！所以嚴正地說，在今日而編印史籍的初步結集，只許有「二十五史」，其數量决不容隨便減縮或延伸，如要擴充增大，非得依照顧先生所詔示的那樣有意義，有統系地做才行。用特附識於此，藉廣顧先生的盛意，並乘便向一般愛護我們這工作的諸先生解釋一下。</p>

<p>— 朱起鳳</p>
<p>開明書店取殿版二十四史合退耕堂刋柯著新元史爲二十五史，縮製鋅版，刋行問世，屬余一言，以爲紹介。竊以正史之名，肇自隋志，宋定十七史，其後續有增益，至淸遂合舊唐書，舊五代史而爲二十四史。自後漢書以下，皆依馬班舊裁，歷代繼作，與裨官野史之岐出旁分者異也。也部著作夥　，不有甄别，勢將漫無制限。故二十四史之結集，雖出自所謂欽定，而學者至今無異議。明修元史，脫略滋甚。柯氏新著，正舛補漏，爲功實多，援新唐書，新五代史先例，列入正史，可謂名正言順者矣。前乎此者，歷代正史非二十四史不備，今則非二十五史不能賅正史之全。故二十五史之名，雖懸諸國門可也。</p>
<p>抑余更有進者，自活字排印之法行，書籍之出版乃愈多而愈速，益以坊賈牟利，但求速成，焉馬魚魯之誤，罔所顧及。余嘗以銀轉幣數枚，易鉛字排印之筆記若干種，計其値，僅定價十之一，較之木刻善本猶不及百之一也。然一加翻閱，則錯字疊出，不堪卒讀。因念苟有妄人，取甲乙各部要籍草率排印，而低其値以資號召，則前人所謂災及梨棗者，今乃禍延士林矣。要知書籍校讐不精，則差以毫釐，謬以千里。陸放翁謂錯本書散滿天下，更誤學者，不若不刻之爲愈，蓋亦慨乎其言之。余每聞商務印書館，中華書局等影印舊籍，輒歡喜贊歎。以善本難得，校讐不易，今藉攝影機之助，省排校之勞，無脫誤之弊，誠一舉而數善備也。開明書店以鋅版縮印二十五史，字體雖略小，然較石印者爲淸晰。嘗讀其樣本，老眼昏花，猶能一一辨認。而篇幅少，取値廉。苟續取四庫要籍而一一製版縮印，則有志嚮學者，雖非名門豪族，亦得家藏萬卷，豈不快哉。</p>

<p>— 張世祿</p>
<p>開明版二十五史爲吾國歷朝正史最新最完備之結集。此書包羅中華民族過去種種活動之主要跡象，在讀書界，正如布帛菽粟，爲不可缺少之一種舊籍，此固無俟深論。所當論者，現今一般讀書界對於舊籍之處置，恐不能復有優閒歲月，將整部大書，逐卷，逐行，逐句，逐字細細誦讀，僅將其置諸案頭，以供平日隨時翻閱檢查。故現今所刋行之舊籍，一方面固須包羅完備，一方面尤須使讀者得有携藏與翻檢之便利。開明版二十五史，於殿本二十四史增入新元史外，明史亦附有考證，全書末並加人名索引，各史末又附列參考書目，除翻檢稱便外，尤足以啟發研讀者之心靈。包羅完備，而全書所佔空間絕少。篇幅雖少，而字體仍極明晰。鑄工雖鉅，而售價仍極低廉。凡以適應現今一般讀書界之需求者，無所不臻其極。吾謂此書不特爲讀史者之寳物，尤爲推廣吾民族文化之利器也。吾國人其鑒之！</p>
<h3 id="c228">現代的印刷術 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>丨二十五史的照相鋅版印刷丨</p>
<p>普通人都祗知道新式的印書法有「鉛印」和「石印」的兩種，這是無怪的。因爲一般流行的書報，大部分都用這兩種印刷，甚至印刷店的門首，也常常掛着「鉛石印刷」的招牌。但用比較專門的話來說，現代的印刷術應該分爲三種：第一種是凸版，第二種是凹版，第三種是平版。凸版是利用版的凸面來印刷的，中國從前的木版和現在的鉛印，都屬於這一種。和這想反的是凹版，受墨的部分不是凸面而是凹面，最常見的鈔票，郵票等，便是用這凹版印刷的。至於石印，却是應用了化學作用，把要用的文字，圖畫等顯現在特種的石版上，印刷的時候，祗有需要的部分可以受了墨印在紙上，别的部分，使他不能受墨，那版子却完全是平面的，一點沒有高低凹凸，和前兩種全然不同，所以屬於平版。這三種印刷，除了凹版因爲製版和印刷都很麻煩，祗適宜於印刷精細的東西外，普通印書用的，便祗有凸版和平版兩種了。</p>
<p>但是，凸版印刷普非祗有鉛印一種，平版也不止石印一種。和石印相同的平版，有金屬版—鋅版，鋁版（谷稱鉛皮版），膠版（俗稱橡皮版）等，而凸版除了鉛印卽活字印刷外，也還有照相鋅版，照相網紋銅版，電鍍銅版之類。現在開明版的二十五史，就是用照相鋅版印刷的。這種印法，在印刷機上完全和鉛印相同，換一句話，就是同樣用鉛印的機器印刷，而不是用石印的機器印刷。不過鉛印是把活字一個個的組合起來，經過校改之後來印，而鋅版却是把原稿用照相方法做成陰版，翻到塗布感光劑的锌版上去，用光線使锌版上顯出和原稿相反的文字來，然後把不感光部分的感光劑洗去，祗剩着感光的部分，再用特殊的藥品使這部分成爲耐酸性，最後更用酸性劑把别的部分腐蝕掉，獨剩這有耐酸性的部分。這樣製成的鋅版，形式上差不多和鉛字組成的鉛版相同，不過鋅版的性質比鉛版更硬一點罷了。</p>
<p>同是凸版，二十五史爲什麽不用活字版而用照相鋅版印刷呢？關於這問題，可以用一句很簡單的話來回答，就是一部字數達四五千萬以上的大書，要校對得沒有錯字，實在不是簡短的歲月和少數的人力所能辦到，祗有請精細的照相機去做鈔寫先生，使他複寫在鋅版上，他是負得起絕到無訛的責任的，雖然這位鈔寫先生的薪水，也許比「乎民」和校對先生合起來要大一點。</p>
<p>然而，平版印刷也可以應用照相術的，爲什麽捨棄了平版而採用凸版呢？不錯，照相石印，在市面流行的書用得很多，甚至複印宋元版本的古書，也常常採用金屬版或膠版。但你如果把一本鉛印書和一本石印書互相比較，便可察出其間的不同點。倘使你曾看到過用油光紙細字石印的三國，水滸之類，一定會爲了那種模胡的字跡和浮泛的油墨而起憎惡之感。固然，劣的鉛印書，因了鉛字的毁蝕和油墨的不凈，也常常有如隔一層雲霧的弊病，但比起那種石印書來，總覺得要切實一此。這是因爲石印所用的是平版，平版上受墨的部分和不受墨的部分同一高低，印刷的時候，雖然加以機器的壓力，紙張總不像凸版印刷般的容易與版面密切，在比較粗糙或硬性的紙質尤甚。而且，平版的印刷，全版面都經過墨棍滾過，那不受墨的部分，雖用水揩洗，總難免有殘存的處所，石印書中常有細細的黑點，就因爲這緣故。至於照相落石，石面上常不能完全與照相一樣淸晰，所以須經過人工描修。有時因爲字跡不淸，工人從意描寫、以致發生錯誤，也是常有的事情。這些石印上普通的弊病，在比較進步的鉛皮版或橡皮版，固然可以减去不少，但總不及用凸版印刷的照相鋅版。尤其因爲二十五史爲減低成本起見，所用的紙是質地比較粗糙的報紙，而字跡又比較的細，所以用平版印刷，不及用凸版印刷的淸晰，這是採用凸版的最大原因。</p>
<p>印刷是一種工業的技術，大部分讀者對於這些比較專門的瑣屑事情，或者不會十分留意。但在出版家，却是應該經過仔細的考量的。這裏無非發表我們考量的經過，使大家明瞭一點。</p>

<p>吳稚暉先生嘗言，大板之廿四史，十三經注疏，皇淸經解，九通，冊府元龜，太平御覽，全唐文等書，悉爲有産階級之藏書家所必備。但淸寒之士旣無力購置，又無處安放，最爲憾事。若能縮成極小之本，則寒士大感方便矣。今開明書店印行之廿五史，體積旣大减，定價又極廉，恰合吳先生之言，嘉惠寒士，誠非淺尟，不勝欣喜而爲之題。倘吳先生所言之各書，亦盡能如此印出，則厥功尤偉。是所望於開明諸君子之繼續努力者矣。　　丁福保</p>
<p>讀史可以激發愛國之心。舉凡先民之嘉言懿行，往昔之典章文物，莫不備載於史籍。古人往矣，今人承之，宜如何砥行立功，始克無慙肩荷：是讀史以後必有之感念也。史籍最稱繁富，而二十四史號爲正史，正史者，標凖之謂。柯氏書最近出，爲正史之儕偶，合而爲二十五，允矣。學者能取二十五史而隨時諷誦焉，其獲益豈僅在個人而已哉。　江　源</p>
<p>一部廿五史從何處讀起？這話有點那個。書何嘗是要從頭讀到底，從頭讀到底便是沒有道理。廿五史只像一座寳庫，閒時看，忙時翻，排在那里。開明廿五史裝成九册，携帶便利，頗有巾箱戰艦意味。</p>
<p>這似乎一首不知調寄什麽的搊彈詞，其實一部書好雖好，也得呌人買得起，放得下，要翻檢隨時檢得到。開明本最好好在有索引，一檢檢得着。我久想集各史列傳編成一部中國名人列傳，現旣有了這索引，買一部也就等於有一部最完備的人名大辭典了。　林</p>
<p>俗語說，一部二十四史從何說起，可見讀史眞不容易。現在開明版「二十五史」只有九本，於經濟，便利兩點得空前之成功。從此二十四史不妨大說特說矣。　俞平伯</p>
<p>史書繁富，居今之世，殆難徧讀。時或翻檢，又必攤書盈几，久久而後得所需焉。今開明書店以新元史厠二十四史，合稱二十五史。且爲治新裝，如斯巨著，纔九册耳。其便益學人何可限量耶！</p>
<p>無疑的，二十五史是一部必備的參攷書籍。一般人批評二十五史是英雄主義的。但是英雄主義也有它的時代，不過是已經過去罷了。我們儘可以非英雄主義的立塲，閱讀英雄主義的二十五史，在個人的傳記中間找求出來當時的社會形態—這不單是可能的方法，而且是唯一的方法。尤其，二十五史中的「兵」，「刑」，「食貨」等志，是有重大的時代意義的。</p>
<p>開明書店的出版技術是人人都稱讚的。它不單是能够充分的運用現代的印刷技術，而且能充分的運用現代的編輯技術。它這番最大的貢獻，是使這一部必備的書籍，成爲一般人買得起的書籍。所收羅的都是公認的「善本」，而又加上兩種有無上的參攷價値的附錄。版本縮小的結果，加添收藏和携帶的便利，而沒有失卻參攷上的便利—參攷書是不需要很大的版本的。攝影鑄版，更可以避免錯字。　章乃</p>
<p>我覺得舊式的二十四史就使有錢買，也沒有地方擺，尤其不便帶。像開明書店的二十五史這樣，擺帶都方便，買也比較不喫力的翻印本，我是歡迎的。　陳望道</p>
<p>我常說出版家應該替亭子間的朋友設點法。如果一切的書都像二十五史這樣印出來，亭子間裏就藏得半個四庫。所以當開明書店出版二十五史的時候，我先要喝一聲采。　傅</p>
<p>嘗從學校之考試成績研究，而知當世靑年對於歷史殊多荒疎。此現象深可憂慮。疎於歷史卽昧於往昔之文化、無由考知吾華民族精神之所寄。而爲今日之中國人，不亦難哉。余願喚起靑年之注意，今後宜多誦習史籍。不僅誦習而已，又必於其中窺見吾華民族之精神，從而發揚光大之，庶不媿爲今日之中國人也。開明書店印行二十五史，仿外國普及本之形式，於靑年至爲便利。余旣感誦習史籍之必要，樂以此書介紹於當世之靑年。　劉湛恩</p>
<p>久想得到一部放在案頭的二十四史。現在開明出版二十五史，實現了我的夢想，同時也解决了旅客們如何能携帶此斷代的百科全書的問題。　鄭振鐸</p>

<h3 id="c252">着着佔先 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>除第二盤爲卡所勝外、其餘三盤、小鄭皆佔極對之優勢、第一盤四比二而六比四、第三盤二比一而六比二、第四盤三比一而五比二而六比四、即第二盤雖爲卡爾生所勝、小鄭亦曾以三比一居先、卡爾生連勝五局而勝、故昨日小鄭之得勝、殊爲容易也、先由卡爾生開球、小鄭所得、於是各一各二、小鄭左右兩角之對抽、使其以四比二佔先、但卡發球、亦連勝兩局、成四比四、然其次一局、卡之發球又敗、鄭發球、卡接連觸網三次、鄭以六比四先勝第一盤、</p>
<h3 id="c253">繼續努力 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>第二盤仍由卡先發球、卡開始上網攔殺、但鄭以極巧妙之反手斜射球、攻卡爾生之反手、使卡回擊不得、鄭於是乎連勝二局、復以三比一佔先一此時小鄭漸見、出界及未過網者甚多、卡爾生乃乘機上進被其連勝五局、以六比三回勝第二盤、第三盤之開始、卡又勝二局、小鄭乃大爲奮起、亦以一氣呵成、連勝六局、反以六比二得勝、因此鄭以二對一又佔先、</p>
<h3 id="c254">最後鏖戰 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>卡爾生連失六局失去第三盤、其體力之疲乏、已顯而易見、休息之戰、兩人精神重振尤以鄭兆佳毫無倦態、鄭先發球、勝之、遂以　比一佔先、次局鄭發球、失敗可惜、幸卡形勢已非、欲作最後之孤注、追成五比三、鄭發球以四十丨三十佔先、卒爲卡勝、成五比四、此時空氣之緊張、無以復加、因次局卡發球、將成五比五、則前途勝敗、又不可測、鄭自三十丨四十、挽成平等、經過十二次之平等、一次復一次、卡爾生精疲力竭而敗、最後一盤六比四、</p>

<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>照普通的說法，玩具是我們小朋友的第二生命，玩具能够發展我們的情感，感覺，知識，和意志。</p>
<p>但是，從另一方面看來，今年八個月來，外國游戲玩具進口總數，據國際貿易局調查，共計國幣六十六萬四千多元、比去年增加了五分之一，（去年全年共五十八萬多元）其中尤以日本玩具進口最多。因此，我們小朋友發生了一種矛盾的心理，我們不能不需要玩具，但玩具的漏巵又有如此可驚的數字，事實不允許我們再需要玩具；我們再要玩具，就不愛國，愛了國，就不能再玩具。</p>
<p>其實，我們不必枉操這種心思，今後我們補救玩具漏巵的辦法有二；（一）自製玩具，我們依照書上的玩具製造法，自己動手倣製，並且請學校裏的工藝敎師指導我們做。（二）購買國貨玩具。如若玩具的構造太複雜，爲我們不能製造時，那我們就去購買國貨玩具，請爸爸媽媽仔細辨認商標。</p>

<p>現在英國首相麥克唐納，他是一個最歡喜讀書的人，他時常是在閱讀，讀書固然不大停止，他辦起公來，一連幾小時，不斷的把政府方面的公文，一頁頁的閱讀，及至閱讀完畢，纔肯罷手，可見他閱讀是按着次序，並不是東翻西閱亂雜無章的，小朋友閱讀，常有一種不好的習慣，是一本書到手，前面沒有看，就看後面；或是這本沒有看完，就掉看那本；及至間到書上說的是什麽？依然答不出來，這是很不好的，可取麥克唐納榜樣，作閱讀方法，纔可以領會，讀書是他終生的習慣，幼年在孩童時候，他就喜歡讀書，觀察和研究一切問題，他時常對人說；「他所以能够發展得到新的地位，便因爲讀書的緣故。」</p>
<p>孫中山先生說；「我一生除革命之外，只有讀書是嗜好，一天不讀書，便不能生活，」他在火線上督戰，身邊還帶着書籍，平時喜歡讀書，更可想見了，所以他能够在學理上著述許多書出來。</p>
<p>曾文正公帶兵時，每天有規定讀書寫字時間，以爲常課，從不間斷，某次軍隧疫症傳染，死亡相繼，又爲敵軍包圍，他仍不分心，誦讀如常，他有這樣鎭定和專一的精神，所以不但武功好，文學亦好。</p>

<p>小朋友！你們應該記牢這一句話··勝利屬於勇敢的人！</p>
<p>勇敢的人是前進的，無畏的，他把一切的阻礙，敵人，都打倒了，勝利就是屬於他的！膽怯的人縮在後面，他永遠不會有成功的事業！</p>
<p>不信，請你看下面的一個故事。</p>
<p>在日俄戰爭以前，有一次，海參崴的一家酒樓中，有一個俄國軍官和一個日本軍官，一同飲酒。他們兩人都喝得大醉，於是話便多起來了，各人誇張本國的兵士，二人起了很大的爭執，最後，兩人决定，就在這酒樓的平屋頂上把衛隊來比賽。</p>
<p>最先是俄國兵士操練，當隊漸漸走近屋頂的邊的時候，那些兵士的步伐，不約而同的，縮小起來，等到走到屋頂的邊的時候，他們便停着踏步而不前進了，踓然那長官並沒喊立定或踏步的口令。</p>
<p>後來輪日本兵操了，也是和俄國兵一般的操法。</p>
<p>但是當日本兵走近屋頂的邊的時候，絲毫沒有畏縮，仍舊昻然大步的向前進，走到邊上，軍官沒喊立定的口令，他們就衝出屋頂，直跌下去。</p>
<p>這就是勇敢的表演。</p>
<p>後來日俄大戰，日本究竟戰勝了俄國。</p>
<p>所以我說：勝利是屬於最勇敢的人的！小朋友，記牢罷。</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>動物年齡的長短，和它生長的遲速，恰成正比例。生長速的，年齡也短；生長遲的，年齡當然也長久。照動物學家估算：普通的動物，生長和年齡，爲一與十之比，譬如狗一年長大，它便有十年生活；貓六個月長大，它便祇有六年生存力了。動物中的鹿呀鶴呀龜呀，它們生長得很遲，所以它們的年齡也很長久了。</p>
<p>人類的生長，早的十六年，遲的二十年，照比例計算，應當活上一百六十至二百歲爲甚麽不見這麽大年紀人呢？實在因爲人類太聰明了，七情六慾的起滅，已把年齡打了一個折扣，吃的東西，烹炒煎煮，花樣眞多，也使腸胃易病。此外文明一天天的進化，人身原有的抵抗力，也一天天的薄弱，因此一經疾病的侵襲，便容易夭折了。所以人們不能長壽的原因，倒是自取其咎的。</p>

<p>— 若朋</p>
<p>在家中覺得非常的無聊，終是想不出一件有趣味的事情，來做我的消遣品；大約想了半小時光景，才想出來這件事却狠平凡而且狠有趣的。</p>
<p>我手裏拿了蒼蠅拍打了一個蒼蠅，再從地上看了多時，發現了一二個螞蟻，就把這死的蒼蠅，丢在螞蟻的旁邊、它的觸角微微地觸了一獨，並且略略地用力一拖，但却絲毫不動；於是再爬在蒼蠅上，用嗅覺吻了一吻，然後跑下來；頭搖擺擺地沿着階石，好似去呌大隊人馬的樣子。</p>
<p>一會兒；只見從柱石下的石隙中，有一隊很整齊的人馬出來，漸漸地自遠而近了。後來竟到目的地，它們的秩序很好，互相恊力的拖着，把這蒼蠅飛也似地扛到洞裏去了，不過剩着幾個覓食的螞蟻在外面奔走。</p>
<p>我看到這件有趣的事後，覺得他們狠小的動物，很能守秩序和整齊，難道我們不及這小小的動物嗎？小朋友們！你們應該養成如螞蟻的精神，不論在什麽時候，都要有秩序和整齊；那末到了社會上去的時候，一定能够成功一個良好的公民了！</p>

<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>空氣中所含的水蒸氣，在空中遇冷時，一定會凝結，這凝結成的就是雲。</p>
<p>關心天氣的人，他們必常常仰望空中的雲。雲多天會下雨，雲少，天氣很好，雲高，雲低，雲向南行，雲向北走，都可以從雲而觀察天氣的好壞。另一方面，雲的开態色彩都非常美麗，當旭日初升，或夕陽西墜的時節，那時候的雲是多麽神妙啊！因爲這樣，雲有許多種類，區别，名稱，小朋友們研究科學，這是必要的智識呀！</p>
<p>雲大槪可分作十種來講：（一）層雲，就是霧雲，這是雲中間最低的一種，陰天時候，遮蔽在小山頂上的就是。（二）雨雲，也呌亂雲，雲色暗黑，下雨時看見黑雲一層層堆疊着的就是，（三）積雲，像白棉花一樣重疊着，成圓形，夏天時候最多。（四）雷雲，一名積亂雲，是積雲和雨雲混合成的。書上所說的「雲峯」，就是指着這種雷雲。（五）層積雲，是螺旋形暗灰色的大雲塊。看去好像要下雨一樣，其實不是雨雲。冬天這種雲最多，把日光遮住了，使天氣更冷。（六）卷雲，也可呌條雲。常在藍色的天空見着一條條像白刷毛那樣，如果遇着微風好像熖火的烟飄蕩着，是雲中間最高度的一種。天氣的變化，見這雲移動的方向可以知道。如果從北方來的，這知道天氣晴朗，如果從南方來的，則天氣惡劣。（七）卷層雲，是卷雲滿布天空時積疊起來而成的，像薄紗一樣。（八）卷積雲，是白色的小塊像魚鱗一樣，所以也呌鱗片雲。（九）高積雲，和卷積雲相像較大，色灰白，遠看像牧塲中的羊羣，所以又名羊雲。（十）高層雲，是灰色像幕一樣。張在天空中的，在下雨以前常常可以看見，和雨雲相彷彿，有時由高層雲層積而成雨雲。</p>
<p>雲和氣候寒冷也有關係，夏季灼熱的天氣，有雲出來便能凉爽些，冬季寒冷的夜裏，有了雲，也可以較爲溫暖，小朋友們不妨去試騐一下。</p>
<h3 id="c294">改良的風車 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 永采</p>
<p>小朋友！你們不是很喜歡風車的嗎？的確，風車確是件文雅而有趣的玩意，我們假使拿他彩紙多做幾個，連串在一處，迎風飛舞的當兒，就格外好玩啦！但是，普通做的風車，（如圖一）旣耗費紙張，又太嫌單調。現在我們有一種改良的風車，似乎比較普通的省紙和美觀，我想拿來貢獻給小朋友們。以下就是它的製法：</p>
<p>倘你們想做一個八角的風車，那先把零碎廢紙，裁剪成八張一式的四十五度的三角形，（如圖二）然後再剪一塊小圓紙，把八張三角紙的甲角，依次粘在小圖紙上，（如圖三）粘牢了，再把八張紙的一角，也依次的粘在另一塊小圓紙上，（如圖四）前後和普通的一樣，鑽兩個孔就成了。小朋友！你們看！這種風車不是比並通的美觀了不少嗎？假使你們還想做繁複點，那祇要再加多幾張三角形的紙張就好了，十二角形十六角形也可以照樣做成的。</p>
<p>還有，如果你們嫌風車轉動不活絡，那你們祗要拿洋紙粘一個小紙圈，（大約長約一分，直徑約一分半）套在風車背面的竹扦上，就會格外活絡了。</p>
<p>拿風車來測騐風向，也常常很是正確，你們假使要玩的話，做四個同樣大的風車十字架式的結在竹竿上，挿在庭院中最高的地方，就可以觀測了。不過，有兩點要注意：一要認淸正確的方向，二要在四個風車上各做一個代表方向的特别顯明記號。</p>

<p>「看啊！」伊問了：「我這回有母牛大了吧？」</p>
<p>「噢！沒有！」小蛤蟆們同聲的答。</p>
<p>伊又用力的鼓一番，眼看伊的肚子就要漲裂了。</p>

<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>恭讀胡適博士本月十三日發表於大公報的「悲觀聲浪裏的樂觀」的大文，對於下列的一段，不知抵徊了若干遍。</p>
<p>「但這二十三年中最偉大而又最容易被人忽略的進步，要算各方面的社會改革。最明顯的當然是女子的解放。在身體方面，現在二十歲左右的中國女子不但恢復了健全的人樣，並且漸漸的要變成世界上最美的女性了。……此外如女子經濟地位與法律地位的抬高，如女子參加職業和社會政治事業的人數的加多，如婚姻習慣的逐漸變更，如離婚婦女與再嫁婦女在社會上的地位的改善，這都是二十年來中國社會的大進步。」</p>
<p>二十年來婦女有這麽大的進步，而且在中國是算最偉大的進步，我們婦女也可笑逐顔開了！願齊聲高歌邵元冲先生的國慶歌：「鼓無吧！國民！謳歌罷！國民！……内安外攘，國阜民康！武烈觥觥震八荒！蠢彼醜類，敢犯天常！」以抒寫胸中的樂意！</p>
<p>可是另一方整全國的公娼私娼，歌舞雜娼，野雉淌白，摩登下流，……所有零賣皮肉的女性，雖没有正確的統計，沽量起來，二十三年來至少不止多了二十三倍罷？鄉村不能立足，抛頭露面地湧進城市來；城市裏找得着啖飯地，便含羞忍辱地受着雇主或工頭的蹂躪；找不着啖飯地，便又不顧「廉恥」地躺在稠人廣衆的馬路中；這些，該是二十三年前的婦女所没有的。卽丢開下層社會不説，上中層社會，又怎的不可悲？今年上上下下談的女人，還不是打不出正當的出路，尋不着高尙的事業，便拿弱者的女人來遣悶，來洩憤？還不是二十三年前那個以女人爲可欺侮，可嘲笑，可玩弄的思想没有撕去分厘？</p>
<p>再則女子自身方面，那個老調的依賴，服從，虚榮，守舊，等等的惡德，從家庭的，學校的，社會的，可給了她們多少的糾正和改革？二三特出的，幸運的婦女，固然已在社會上得了良好的地位，這在整個的婦女看來，只可算是凌霄花似地攀高登危。我人若越是以此現象爲滿足，抹殺了婦女大衆的水火日深，將越顯得我們的婦運，是一根日光水分不足的豆芽；越是伸得高時，越是纖弱易萎了！這而能殼樂觀，將如劉家後主，被拘在洛陽，還能口稱「樂不思蜀」，則又何事不樂觀呢？</p>
<p>社會的思想，習慣，各式的生活，都還是拿女人踏在脚下。我們不稀罕三四千年前有過孟母太姒，我們理不稀罕三四千年有個武后班昭；我們但願目前有眞正的男女平權解放。</p>
<p>許多洋人到了中國，都稱讚我們幾聲；前些時一個外國文人，竟説要娶中國女性，然而不久他還是抱了美國女人。所以凡是對人不切當的恭維，雖或言者出於好意，也不過長子慈悲地寛解矮子的心。我人對胡博士的樂觀，實在是未可樂觀。</p>
<h3 id="c299">現代蘇聯婦妇的工作（續） <a href="#c299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— By　M.　E.　Walker　薛績輝譯</p>
<p>關於醫藥方面我還觀察到另一種情形丨婦女可以做醫藥研究的工作。我發現某一間很大的微菌學院的院長是一個中年，短髮的婦人，爲顯微鏡，人工繁殖之微菌，抗毒素等所包圍着。她和我談話時。一隻眼睛仍望着一個盛滿肉羹的試騐玻璃管。好説及她和她的助手們最近的工作，即在俄國東南一帶撲滅瘧疾的運動。她那些男同事服從她的命令如一般學生似的，一點反抗都没有，這是很有趣味的事。</p>
<p>在某一個比較大的城市中我看見一切在進行中的教育試騐事業滿佈着女性工作人員。所有圖書館，博物院的職員通常都是女子，在這種建築物中男子是很罕見的。她們受很完善的教育，她們的職位是以能作關於藝術，文學或音樂等演講爲條件的。在這班人的工作中我又發現了其中有些婦女組織教育巡週演講，在她們居住的隣近城市中作各種關於歷史或古物的有興味汪講。</p>
<p>托兒所的制度使那些工廠的女工或在田中耕作的婦女，在工作的時候可以把她們的兒童交給一班曾受訓練的看護管理。政府對於這種制度没有什麽規定，其實所有這種托兒所的組織全由婦女管理。這或者是因爲俄國人不能壓抑其個性而在他們最單純的行動中除去人的關係。另一種婦女是專門料理蒙養園的。在南方我看見海邊一個很美麗的城。她們所用以教導兒童的方法好像是綜合福勞柴爾（Ｆｒｏｅｂｅｌ）蒙台梭利（Ｍｏｎｔｅｓｓｏｒｉ　Ｎ·Ｅ·Ｕ·）幾種制度，同時又不像任何一種。那些兒童當然是很快樂，充滿許多意思，常常在沙堆，通孔的紙，或黄土中表現出來。外間對於俄國做投機事業和犯法的罪人之如何就捕正法，丨丨他們所受的刑罰通常是很重的丨丨也許覺得奇訝，其實並没有什麽秘訣，專做這種工作的爲一大隊婦女，她們在菜市或城中熱鬧的街道上和那些買東西的人混在一塊，在買什物的當中。她很注意身邊一切來往的人。她們很熱識詐騙的一切詭計，尤其是損害國家利益的詐騙行爲。因此，這些行爲是很少能逃出她們的明察以外的。她們很顯明地是欺騙者的大仇敵；她們假如發現了欺　的行爲，必有嚴厲的處置。　果那個被騙者是勞工份子，他們會處置得更加嚴厲。如果那個佔便宜的人並非俠義的勞工份子，他們的懲罰便更嚴厲了。</p>
<p>蘇俄的教育，實際上全爲婦妇所主管。在教育部内重要的職位差不多盡爲婦女所佔有。她們有委任新教員之權，有審定課本之權。她們所從事的是促進成人教育和滅絶文育。尤其特别注意新兵的教育，所以鄉間中充滿有教育義意的標語和招貼。巡迴電影常常由一個城到第二個城帶着電影和畫片去宣傳各種流行症之禦防治療。在載着這種宣傳材的車輛上，一部份的工作人員往往就是婦女。</p>
<p>莫斯科有一個特别機關，專門研究工廠中婦女勞工的一切情形。每個工業建築物中都有牠的分辦事處，全俄國的婦女勞工都由牠管理，非經過這個機關認可，没看女工是能被革退的；即使某女工因爲不合的行或其他的錯誤而被停止工作，也要等到代她找到了第二個職位之後才能使她自動的更調而受新長官的管理。婦女們不單管理工商業中女性的一切事件，而且參加管理和監視下列的事項，如經費的收支，利潤的盈餘，全體職工和貨物的保險，僱主方面應納的税項，商品出廠時的彯凖檢騐，每個工人所需要的工作分量，練習生字習工作時所受的便利，工業中心各處所設立的俱樂部，有組織的娛樂時間，和不識字的工人所藉以學習讀書寫字各種方便。</p>
<p>婦女已有非常優異的成績而同時並不被那些不合理的妒忌所牽制的就是司法界的職業。我用過整個下午在一個像慈母一樣的女律師的辦事處中細聽也許用不着到法庭而可和解的各種寃情之申訴。我很愉快地在那里小必聽着。大部份的訴訟委托者都是農民，他們多是與鄰居因爲各種耕田的器具，家庭的用品和家蓄而涉訟。有一個老人來問有什麽方法可以使那個新來的青年醫士重新代他裝上前星期所拔出的牙齒；他完全所對這種新治療的方法，因爲他的老友不再揭露他的嘴唇了。一個盛怒的少婦來抗議她同居的那些老年人之違反禁令的吐痰習慣。下午辦公時間完了之後、我好位律師有友把案件記錄交給我看，這些案件是要送交地方法院中的一個女職員的。那女職員的責任在審查傳票是否無誤，和證人是否按時出庭。這又是一種最近才有婦女參加的職位。我們假如偶因不幸須要到法庭時，以前那種不守時間的討厭情形，我相信最少也可减少百份之五十。</p>
<p>某天我住的那間房的電燈壞了，我便通知公共電燈管理處的女稽查，我弄錯了，我所通知的是公用局的女監督。這個公用局是管理水，電，交通，道路的清潔的，我以爲連修理工作也在牠主管之内。這里的女稽查很留意一切公共浴堂，公共洗衣處和合作住宅的情形。破壞或浪費公共物件是被懲罰得很利害的。她們在很短的時間之内便把壞了的電燈弄好。如果他們對其他的工作都是一樣快捷，那就這個城内的居民對於一切設備感覺不滿意的一定很少了。</p>
<p>和現代蘇俄婦女接觸後所覺得的是；在這個國家内整個的趨勢在把婦女從家庭中帶出來，而把全國需要誠實和有同情心的工作交給她們管理。至於蘇俄婦女對於工作之能忠實負責，那是毫無疑問的。她把一種世界久已接受的制度，即以男子爲地方及中央政府的唯一原動力的制度，完全推翻。即酷加批評的人也不能不承認她們的判斷並没有顯着的錯誤，亦不至遇難而畏縮。</p>
<p>我所見的一切婦妇工作，都表現出一種宣教師一類的精神。這種精神大約是原始時代鼓勵冒險移殖的婦女那種大無畏的精神所激發出來的。牠好像是改造整個蘇俄國家生命的偉大泉源。至於情感是絶對没有地位的。把牠維繫着的是一條由合作的環扣所組成的不斷的鍵。每個環扣都是由熱誠鍜鍊出來的，這種在鍜鍊中的新環扣數目又是無可限量的。這就是工作，具有意志和目的的工作—一種新的制度。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c300">避孕法略述 <a href="#c300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— 郭太華醫師</p>
<p>避孕與墮胎，雖其動機目的，往往相同，而在法律與社會問題上，其性質輕重，完全有差。蓋無論如何拘泥於舊道德的人們，决不能認殺滅未成人的精虫，爲抵觸刑章。而處現實經濟崩潰，人事綜錯的世界。誰不知節育論的重要。茲故略述避孕法如下。</p>
<p>（甲）自然避孕法</p>
<p>（一）週期避孕法　婦人第月排卵，多在經前之第十二日至第十九日之八日間，某一日排出卵子，此爲近年來生理學家與婦科學者所公認之事實，故去年日本之荻野博士想依此排卵期制定週期避孕法，就是在此八日内禁止性交，每月經週期中除此八日以外純稱爲不孕期可以隨意性交，而可自然不孕，此方法實在效果甚少，因婦人之排卵期，的確只是在此八日之内，惟性交後，精蟲到了婦人生殖器内之生存期，是不如荻野博士所預測的短促，因精蟲若到達宮腔而至輸卵管下端，可生存二十一日至二十四日，是性交之時，卵雖未排，惟情蟲是可在生殖器内徘徊等候，等卵子於若干日後排出輸卵管，而精蟲卽可於性交之二十一日以後，亦能與卵商合成孕故應用此法，往往不能奏效；據作者所知，在經前二三日與經後一至四日受孕之婦人多至不可勝計，此經前二三日與經後一至四日，當然卽爲荻野博士之所謂安全期，可見此週期避孕法之不足恃。</p>
<p>（二）性交中絶法　卽於男性將射精之前，突然停止性交；此法實行困難，而且於夫婦雙方有甚大之不良影響，不可用。</p>
<p>（三）性交减少法　卽性交次數减少，此法不獨不能避孕，而且更容易受孕。</p>
<p>（四）特異射精法　男性於射精時，射出於陰户之外，或以手壓攝護腺下方，使精液中途折回，此法亦屬實行難，而雙方精神肉體，均有不良影響，尤以中途壓回一法，能令男性尿道海棉體發生腫炎疼痛，害處更大。</p>
<p>（乙）人工避孕法</p>
<p>（一）器械避孕法　男性用者有盲腸陰莖套，橡皮陰莖套，龜頭套，此法於避孕方法較爲有效，惟套往往絲微破裂，卽精蟲從破孔流出，則依然不能避孕，如且於夫婦雙方，受害甚大，尤其婦人方面受害更大，常用者，能致婦人性寒，歇斯的里，萎黄，貧血，及其他疾病；男性方面，則能致精神頽喪，早洩，全身衰弱等，與常患手淫之害無異，故此法切不宜常慣施用；女性用避孕器械，爲子宮帽，子宮栓，陰道球，子宮針，海棉塞等；除子宮帽外其餘四種，均不甚有效，而且害處其大，如宮頸潰爛，宮炎，宮頸炎等，只子宮帽比較上爲可用，惟子宮帽須依該婦人之子宮頸之大小始能配購同時於套上子宮帽時，自己亦難自套，就别人代套，亦往往套不正宮頸，卽精蟲仍可從微小之隙縫中進入宮内受孕，故功效亦往往不確，而且子宮帽亦能致宮頸炎及宮頸糜爛。</p>
<p>（二）洗滌避孕法　是於性交後，用婦科洗滌器以含酸性藥水或淡滅菌藥洗滌陰道，如水楊酸，石炭酸，硼酸，來蘇等百分之二和煖開水九十八。此法成效雖有，惟禍害甚大，因此類凡能傷殺精蟲之藥液，總有刺戟作用，時日漸久，陽道粘膜之神經麻鈍，或成陰道炎或宮頸炎等禍害，而且施用亦較爲煩瑣。</p>
<p>（三）藥品避孕法　此指市上藥房發售各國製成之避孕藥而言，此類避孕成藥，因用法簡單，祗於性交前塞入陰道底，故普通之避孕婦女多數採用，惟此類避孕藥，各國均有無數出品，名稱繁多。種類不一。茲將其主要成分。略述數種。如遇錳酸鉀，硼酸，明礬，單寗酸酒石釀，金雞納霜等。要不外殺滅精虫。然以藥力有限。精虫不能殺盡。有時亦往往無効。</p>
<p>（四）Ｘ光避孕法　用適當之Ｘ照射，亦能使卵子於指定之時期三四年或六七年，不成熟排出，惟照射時，雖經騐熟練之Ｘ光專家，亦往往稍一疏忽卽能改永久不孕，而且内分沁會因而異常，全身起不良影響。</p>
<p>（五）血清避孕法　爲蘇俄托烏綏諾夫及卡查二人所發明，其根本理論，卽爲Ｓｐｅｒｍｉｍｍｕｎｉｔａｔ精液免疫，最近德美各國生物學家，亦紛起研究，此法是先將活精蟲注入某種動物之血液内，此動物體内之血液卽自然發生一種對抗的免疫素，以抗滅精蟲，就採取此項有對抗精蟲免疫素的血清，製成避孕注射針，聞蘇俄方面，最近已有此類血清避孕針製成，此法之理論，亦甚正確，動物之實騐在蘇俄方面亦已成功，惟實施於人類，功效如何？入人體内，有無惡影響？因本文作者未曾用過，而各國專家亦尚未有詳細之宣告故不得而知，同時，此類注射劑，似乎在我國尚未有發售。</p>
<p>（六）内分泌液避孕法　婦人於姙娠期中，不再繼續排卵，且無月經，此卽爲黄體與胎盤内分沁之抑制作用，故最近歐美各國醫家，根據此理論，用黄體與胎盤之内分沁　劑注射，以爲短期避孕，卽注射一次後一月至兩月停止排卵不能受孕，到時又依期再行注射，最近德國出品之Ｊｎｆｅｃｕｎｄｉｎ服避孕劑及其他所謂避針藥，多屬根據此種理論製成，此法之理論固屬正確，惟現有製劑，因研究未久，故尚未製練精純，於施用方面，往往亦不能收預期之效，在不久之將來，歐美方面根據此理論與多方之實騐，或有更理想而完密之製劑發明未定。</p>
<p>（七）手術避孕法　用開刀手術由醫師將男性之睪丸，或女性之卵巢剔出，當然可永久不孕，惟男女雙方之精神與肉體，隨之起絶大的不良影響，故絶不能用，輸精管，輸卵管，子宫，剔出，其害處亦爲永久不孕，萬一再到需要生育時，已無法挽救，其他輸精管輸卵管結札法亦間有永久不孕之弊，故手術之避孕法，當推輸卵管移位法較爲良好，如到再希望生育之時，可再行開刀，將輸卵管移返原位，仍能照常受孕，惟開刀以避孕，似乎小題大做耳。</p>
<p>綜上所述，在現代的醫學情况之下，諸多避孕法，除手術法而外，均不能稱爲絶對安全，惟比較的受孕機會减少而已。而内分泌液法與血清法。將來若能研究完成。或最近於理想而有望。</p>

<p>— 李葵</p>
<p>冷眼一看這「吉林的婦女」五個字，好像没有什麽話可説。彷彿吉林的婦女，也不會跟别的地方的婦女兩樣：在城市裏，有許多富人們豢養的太太小姐們，還有許多專門供男人洩慾的妓女暗娼們；在鄉間，有許多專門給丈夫養小孩，燒飯，做衣服的賢妻良母……這些，差不多各省都是一樣。當然我也説不出什麽新花樣</p>
<p>這樣一來，我不是没有話可説了嗎？不然！我所要説的婦女，確不是這些跟各省没有什麽區别的婦女；而是一種據有特殊性的婦女。她們長的也和别的地方的婦女一樣；不過她們過的生活，做的事情，跟别的地方的婦女不同罷了。</p>
<p>這種婦女，在「九一八」前還不甚多；只有延吉，汪清這兩縣的鄉間有；到「九一八」後，這種婦女可就增多起來了。不但這兩縣的這種婦女增加了；就是在磐石，樺甸這兩縣·也有這種婦女的出現。</p>
<p>她們是跟男子一樣的；她們要穿上義男軍的衣服，不用説你冷眼看不出來她們是婦女；就是你細看看，也覺得她們跟男子一樣。</p>
<p>這四縣（當然除了這四縣之外，還有；不過以這四縣爲最多把了）義勇軍裏的男子，是不分國際的；有朝鮮的，有中國的；當然婦女也是跟男子一樣也是不分國際的。</p>
<p>「九一八」以後，這四縣的義勇軍的勢力更加擴大了，組織成許多前鋒隊，敢死隊……每隊裏都有三分之一的婦女在工作着。她們有的到前綫去跟日本和「滿洲僞國」的軍隊開火；有的在後方做工作。</p>
<p>她們的婚姻旣不受舊禮教的束縛，又不受金錢的支配；她們的婚姻是絶對自由的。比方她們和她們的愛人戀愛到結婚的程度了，她們就馬上搬到一起實行同居。</p>
<p>雖然　她們生活過提很苦（因爲被日本的壓逼物質方面感到缺乏）可是她們的精神確是快活的；她們做起事來，總是即末敏捷，着實，那末有生氣；所以男子們，都稱她們爲「快活的人兒！」</p>
<h3 id="c303">婦女救濟事業的立足點 <a href="#c303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— 碧漪</p>
<p>中國婦女的生活，當然是很痛苦的，但是實行解救，惟有靠婦女仍自己努力，乞憐於人，終無濟於事；但是在目前情况之下，這些受壓迫而失却自助能力的婦女仍如何减輕其痛苦，則須求之於社會已有的救濟事業了。關於救濟事業，在理論與實施上，各國因背景與立塲的不同，儘管稍有差異；但是出發於人類同情互助的天性，這是無間古今中外，皆是一樣的。然而，如果拿這點同情互助來做救濟事業的根據，其結果也不過社會上多增一批吃閒飯的人，充其所極，可以使整個的民族，沉淪下去！尤其在今日之中國，民族衰弱，國勢佔危的時候，吾仍不得已而談到婦女救濟問題，務必要認清了下面兩點：</p>
<p>（一）救濟期於無救濟；換言之，爲免除救濟而救濟。美國社會學者愛德華帝凡音氏（Ｅｄｗａｅｄ　Ｔ·Ｄｅｖｉｎｅ）於其所著救濟之原理（Ｐｒｉｎｃｉｐｌｓ　ｏｆ　Ｒｅｌｉｅｆ）一書中説；「智慧之慈美，教人自助。並且由物質與精神的援助，發展被救濟者獨立與撙節等性格。」所以救濟的根本目的，應當教養設施，增加被救濟者有益生活上的智識，不要養成倚賴性。這是一切救濟事業所當遵守的原則，又不獨救濟婦女爲然。</p>
<p>（一）中國婦女地位的低落和生活的痛苦，雖然有些支離不切題；但是指出社會經濟教育制度的不良，以致婦女仍才失却自助能力而不得不求助於人。所以那些不幸的婦女，旣被留養於救濟機關，不但要施以教育，養成她們謀生的能力，並且要提高她們的地位，打破一切重男輕女的思想與制度，養成她們獨立的人格。這是談婦女救濟的，特别要認清的一點。</p>
<p>吾們拿這兩點來衡量現在上海一般所謂救濟婦女的機關；有的養而不教，有的不要説到教，連養都不能滿足；有的雖然顧到教養，而成績也汪見佳。所有的房屋，也有因陋就　的，也有是借用的，設備的不良，實不能爲諱。有些機關，雖有確定的基金，也一無措施，實是可惜。至於辦理這種事業的人，大都頭腦冬烘，思想陳舊，缺乏學識，更是到處相同的現象。所以如清節堂的名義規制至今猶在，而教養娼妓等等被壓迫婦女，則當無一完善處所。</p>
<p>上海救濟婦女機關，辦理得如此腐敗，自然盼望政府根據上面的理論，確定方針，去加以改革。更希望從事婦女運動的團體來做這個實際工作，以補政府之不逮。在目前公私經濟俱感窘迫之際，也不必徒然空説形式上的設備如何理想化；但是上海各慈善機關有相當資産的並不少，可是不會善用，所以事業設有發展希望。些後關於救濟婦女的一部分事業應該集中統一在一處，免去現在這樣紛歧散漫，各自爲政的弊痛；在形式的但求整潔不必怎樣美觀；在精神方面斷不能離開上面所舉的兩點，這是婦女救濟事業的立足點，差以毫　，則　以千里了。</p>

<h3 id="c304">人生的意義安在 <a href="#c304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— 少問</p>
<p>因爲各人的生活不同，見解有别，所以對於人生的意義也就有種種不同的解釋存在着。守財奴謂人生的意義在於弄錢，人當爲金錢而生，並爲金錢而死；崇拜愛神維那絲的詩人説人生的意義在於戀愛，人的爲愛情爲生殖器而生活的；悲觀主義者則説「人生如夢」，一切皆無意義可言………—這些都是人們由自己的立塲對於人生的意義的解釋。</p>
<p>然而我們却不能因此就説人生根本就無一定的意義，有的只是各種各樣的人所抱的各種各樣的人生觀或人生哲學。話是不能這樣説的，因爲在此問題中雖有許多不同的意見存在着，而且這些意見都有一定的社會依據，但我們却不能認爲牠們都是對的，因而把牠們並立在一條綫上，說人生的意義可以作多種解釋，不能有一定的論斷。我們知道，眞理有其相對性，也有其絕對性，對於「人生的意義安在」這問題的解釋，也是有其相對和絕對的意義的；在各個不同的解釋的相對關係上，每一解釋都是對的；但在一定的時間和空間之下，在這些相對的解釋中却有正確的解釋存在着，這正確的解釋便是絕對的。所以，無論對人生問題有好多的意見存在着，我們也是可以找出人生的意義來的。</p>
<p>人類的知識發展到了現在，使我們認識到了下面那樣的事情—</p>
<p>首先，人是萬物中之最靈者。人不僅有足有手，而且還有一個特殊的腦袋，不僅有本能，而用還能意識地活動。别的動物只能本能地依靠自己的爪牙或别的東西去謀生存，牠們只能適應環境，不能改變環境；人則不然，他能製造工具，使用工具去征服自然界，他不僅是適應環境，而且能意識地去改變環境。所以，人能日益改善其生活，能從茹毛飲血進到喫大菜飲啤酒，能從穴居野處進到住幾十層高的洋房，以至進到更高的階段。—人是日益進化的動物，不是退化的動物。</p>
<p>同時，人是社會的動物，人不能離開社會而存在。所謂人類的進化，便是社會的進化。很顯然的，在原始社會中，人類只能茹毛飲血，穴居野處，一定要到所代社會存在之後，才能喫美好的大菜，住高大的洋房。人類之能由茹毛飲血和穴居野處進步到住洋房喫大菜者，乃是隨着由原始社會發展到近代社會的社會進化而獲得的。因此，人要日益改善其生活，要使其生活更加舒適美好，便非努力推進社會進化不可。</p>
<p>然而，社會人不見得都是歡迎社會進化的。事實上，有些人在其現實的特殊生活下，不僅不去推動社會的進化，而且是拚命阻止歷史車輪前進的。過去的封建貴族之反對科學文明，近代的帝國主義之壓迫人類的一切進步運動，便都是企圖拉住前進的歷史車輪，並實行開倒車的表現。所以，要推進社會的進化，改善人類的生活，不僅要與自然鬥爭，而且還須向阻止社會前進的人鬥爭。人類社會的進化，便是人類不斷地與自然鬥爭與夫人類本身的不斷的衝突之矛盾的發展。</p>
<p>所謂人生的意義，就在於努力征服自然，與一切阻止人類前進的勢力鬥爭，以促進人類守社會的進化，使人類更能好好生活。如不以此爲然，則人生的意義究竟安在呢？未必人眞的應該醉生夢死罷？或者眞的應該去開歷史的倒車，回返中世紀乃至茹毛飲血的古代罷？我想只要不是墮落到不可挽救的人，只要不是絕對的退化論者，對此是絕不會作肯定的答覆的。</p>
<p>這裏恐怕一定有人要問；在目前，我們須要怎樣去推進社會的進化呢？我們的回答是——眞理是具體的，問題的解决也是具體的。在目前，要具體地確定怎樣去推進社會進化，便非具體地去理解目前的現實的情况不可。因爲一定要根據現實的情况，才能確定推進社會進化的具體方法，也才能具體地决定我們在生活中應該向着怎樣的方向努力，卽具體地確定我們的人生的意義。否則，便會成爲空想家。譬如說吧，生活在中世紀的人，如果不管現實情形如何，只想着前進，飛躍，企圖一下子就跑到「自由的王國」，那便是空想，烏托邦。須知人類社會是逐漸進化的，必須要在一定的現實基礎上，才能有進化到較高階段的可能，在這可能下，人類的努力才能有結果，不然便是徒勞。所謂人生的意義，便是在人類應推進社會進化的原則下，依據現實情形來作具體的决定。</p>

<h3 id="c305">基礎知識丨與丨專門學問 <a href="#c305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— 若夫</p>
<p>人間的一切知識學問，都不是來自渺茫的太空，而是社會的産物。遠在人類社會沒有出現以前，宇宙間絕不會有關於科學，哲學，政治，經濟，藝術，文學……的知識，因而也就不會有任何學術的存在。觀念論者叔本華在其「意志與表象的世界」中説：「……雖當宇宙無其存在，但若有風的存在，音樂還是有的。」這是多麽玄妙的說法丨大家想想，沒有一定的節奏與和諧，只是吹風，怎能呌做音樂呢？須知音樂也是人爲的，也是從人類的勞働生活中産生的，沒有人，沒有人類社會，絕不會有音樂的存在。</p>
<p>因爲一切學術都是社會的産物，所以我們無論研究政治，經濟，哲學，科學，藝術，文學，……乃至於一切技術的學問，都非從社會的見地去理解不可。無論專攻什麽學術，都要具有社會科學的基礎知識，才能入其門徑，探得其本質及其發生發展的情形。否則便會走進神秘的境地而不能自拔的。</p>
<p>同時，研究任何學術，都要有正確的方法，否則便就無從研究起。在這一點上，哲學知識更是一切學術的研究者所不可缺少的。因爲從方法論上說來，哲學乃是社會科學，自然科學，……的基礎。沒有哲學的思維，沒有科學的方法，任何學術便都無法認識，無法把握。所以，任何專家，不僅要有一般的社會科學的知識，而且還須具有哲學的基本理論，不然，則其研究還是成問題的。</p>
<p>社會上有許多自然科學家，藝術家，文學家……，不懂得一般的社會科學知識與哲學的基礎知識的重要，祗知道理頭於自己所專攻的學術，鄙視社會科學和哲學，高唱「爲科學而科學」「爲藝術而藝術」……之歌，結果除跪拜在上帝面前，懇求解决問題外，便是去受錢袋的支配，作金錢的奴隸了。近代有許多自然科學家，如有名的牛噸，湯姆孫。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>愛丁頓，……在最後不是認爲科學不能解釋宇宙之謎而拚命去擁護上帝嗎？所謂「爲藝術而藝術」的理論不是成爲了「爲金錢而藝術」的實體嗎？——這些都是顯然的例證。</p>
<p>然而，反過來說，一種學術之能獨立存在，必然有其一定的特性，有其一定的内容和形式。所以，無論任何學術的研究者，除了必須具有一般的社會科學的知識與哲學的基礎知識外，更當努力研究其所研究的學術，並要專門化。因爲人類知識發展到了現在，每一學術部門都有必須研究的複雜材料，都有其豐富的内容，若不專門去研究，那結果是不會使自己的研究深刻化的。我們可以說，無論怎樣了不起的社會科學家，哲學家，如其對於自然科學或文藝沒有相當長期的研究，沒有自然科學或文藝的專門知識，那他是不能談自然科學或文藝的；卽使他要去談，其結果也不過是大鬧笑話而已，什麽也不會得到的！</p>

<p>在劇塲中或在現實生活中，不管什麽時候，一種情景一有了客觀，就有這樣一種努力；使目光保持在一　與動作的線條成垂直的綫上。在一種兩人或兩人以上的對話中，或當某種東西這方面移到另一方面時，或在一種迴轉的景象中，丨如閱兵，賽會，丨對於觀察最便利的是供給觀客一種與動作的綫條成爲直角的視綫。顧到這種想像中的觀客劇塲才被軸狀地安置起來。凡動作能順應這種要求越來的完滿，卽是說，取得那垂直於想像中的觀客的視綫之位置，那共事者（兩個）間的動作重心就越見均衡。要是那表演的軸綫成立任何别的角度，或與它平行的話，那面向觀客的份子的戲劇效果就會增長起來，反之就要减少了：演員從後方或後方的梯級走進來，那他的效果比那背向着觀衆的同伴更加大了。</p>
<p>談到舞臺設計，它是經過了歷史不少次數的變遷。在中國古代，一個戲劇集團裏對於舞臺這一個部門，向不爲人所注意的：及至近代有了舞臺的設計，那也還是受了歐洲的影響。</p>
<p>歐洲原始的舞臺，就只利用那種單的垂直的軸綫的法則。</p>
<p>在後來希臘的劇塲中，除那中間的進出口之外，後方的左右兩邊還有門口進出；那種設計的技巧，就像現在中國的平劇的無臺那樣。在最古的西班牙舞臺上，似乎有點異樣，它就只有邊的進出口，彷彿如古代的那種「喜劇派」的方式。當左右的進出口的數目增加，同時那中軸增長了時，這種法則是非常有效果的。這是單一的舞臺坐標　（Ｃｏｏｒｄｉｎａｔｅ）　的法則，起源於十六世紀的意大利，後來逐漸普遍全歐，英國也同時倣效起來；中國現時的平劇舞臺設計，恐怕也是脫胎於意大利這種法則的罷？</p>
<p>戲劇的軸綫最初的裝飾表現是門；那指定演員進出的門，在中世紀便是一種裝飾的象徵。後來漸漸美化起來，才有佈景的設置；變景的劇塲有一些沿着那劇塲的中軸或垂直於它的門，把觀客的視綫引向那些門，舞臺表演的地帶。因此，對於那些軸綫的形成，在原則上，中世紀的劇塲與「人本派」的劇塲間是沒有不同的地方。</p>
<p>那實際沿着側幕的綫上的一些進出口，顯然正相當於那在變景的劇塲中從屋子的左右造出來一些進出口；劇塲的搆造在這裏祗是一種圈圍起來的空間，與戲劇的原則是一致的。</p>
<p>不管怎樣，這是一種事實；舞臺的深度從十八世紀起就逐漸縮小，容許有一種第二生標，一種動作的闊坐標；這種改進，不僅帮助了戲劇成功的效果，並且還經濟了不少的空間。</p>
<p>在我們那依着戲劇的一定軸線來處理舞臺設計的法則中，那深舞臺只供給些側面的進出口，它的位置與那建築的中軸成直角。這樣，那側幕就被奉爲設計上的特别重要的要素了。</p>
<p>舞臺設計是一種所與的空間之巧智的組織，建立在一種虛擬的所與的軸線上，卽是想像中的觀客的視線；如果那技術的發展越充分地容許空間被利用於各方面，空間的一切完全被用來服務於戲劇，那舞臺設計的材料丨舞臺本身丨就會與戲劇更加相調和了。</p>
<p>中國現在的舞臺，似乎還沒有什麽改進；就是有點改進的話，也不過祗是變換佈景的手法比較敏捷一點而已。這是指平劇舞臺設計的技巧而言。至於談話劇，那又因爲環境關係的不同，難於判斷；因爲中國目前演話劇並沒有固定的舞臺，所以對於設計方面也祗是臨時搆成的一種適合於所要演的戲劇的臨時佈置，眞正怎樣有完好的設計，一時還談不到呢！</p>

<p>— 羅倫</p>
<p>美國砵地崙通訊</p>
<p>美國人都有三Ｗ的癮：酒與女人是尤其要緊的，爲了這個，又在那樣的環境中，美國就産出了許多賣淫的女人。丨丨我雖然不是一個舊道德家，但我似乎相信一個華工這樣說：</p>
<p>「除去沒有發育的女子之外，全美幾乎沒有一個處女！」</p>
<p>富人家的女子太浪漫了，而且環境使然，一發育就曉得跟人家戀愛，是啦，剛剛發育了的女子的最初戀愛便願意把她的處女膜獻給男子：貧家的女子呢，不是給人家强姦，就是爲生活所迫而情願賣淫，或則日裏做工，晚上就是「街頭的女子」。每個埠頭的百老匯路，都是酒與女人充斥着，這個地方也是一樣。</p>
<p>今天是星期日，我得到休息，便跟着我的同伴走進一所下等戲院，丨丨我還是以芝加哥的話來批評它，實則這地方可以說是中等的了。演的影片好像是什麽加麗拉賓之類的丨丨這些女明星好像已過時了。我到這裏來不過是休息休息無聊的生活。在那裏，你會找到七零八落的佈置，椅子舊了，牆壁傾欹了，但人是滿着，許多女的夾雜在男的中間。</p>
<p>我見到幾個認識的華工，他們都挾着黑女之類的下等「街頭女」來看戲。</p>
<p>在我們的前排有幾個還沒有找到男子的女人之類。燈還亮着的時候，她們都瞧着我們，我對她們是恐懼着，因爲這此女子會任意逗你談話來勾引你的。我打算換坐位，可是全院都滿了。</p>
<p>燈黑了，在我意想中，那一個較爲年老，有三十來歲的美國女人，竟打轉頭來逗我說了：</p>
<p>「你不會太寂莫吧？」</p>
<p>「不會！」</p>
<p>我感覺到她的手挪向我的背後來。同時我又發現另一個女人在引我的同伴說笑，丨丨他比我大些，所以樂於跟她們說話的。過了許久，那女人又挪轉身子來：</p>
<p>「我可以坐在你的旁邊嗎？」</p>
<p>「那沒有什麽要緊，但是沒有座位？」</p>
<p>人是滿了。這句話她說得太不聰明，於是她又不說了。丨丨我從微光中看見她擦滿水粉與胭脂的醜臉在張望四圍。</p>
<p>「你今晚要到我家裏去！」</p>
<p>突然我聽得同伴的「對手」這樣懇求他。我眞恐懼他要失足，我把手兒擰一擰他的大腿。在這不安的騷擾中，好容易才挨過了兩個鐘頭，我們都起來要走了。誰知那幾個美國女人都緊跟着我們，居然還靠近在我們的旁邊，正如一對夫妻一樣。她們都以態度來要求我們的手携上，然而這是不可能的。她牽着我的手，貼近我的臉，甜蜜的說：</p>
<p>「到我家裏去坐坐吧，中國人！」</p>
<p>「不能，我還要去上工呢！」</p>
<p>一直走到門口，我脫去她的手，同伴也如此，我們就擺脫這些騷擾了。我們來到百老匯路之中央，不禁不約而同地大笑起來。在芝加哥沒有碰到過這些事，那些女子只以眼光來勾引你，引不上就走了；在的采也碰到過一次，那時在酒巴間裏，丨丨這裏是不出奇的。</p>
<p>百老匯的燈光漸漸暗淡了。過十二點鐘連汽車都沒有。昔日的繁華，只有老天曉得它的神秘；今日的頽唐，却是人間事！</p>

<p>— 流沙</p>
<p>安慶通訊</p>
<p>年來天災人禍把個農村攪得百孔千瘡，毫無生氣，本來是富於保守性的農民，至是也不能不爲衣食奔走，流徒四方了。我們安徽，比之富庶的蘇浙兩省，本來是一個較貧瘠的省分；尤其是皖北，連年都在災荒之中，農民都是「朝不保夕」；就是較肥沃的皖中皖南，農民近年也一樣在水深火熱之中。一九三一年的大水災是把他們一點家當冲洗得一乾二凈了，去年的豐收成災又幾乎是呌他們白白忙了一整年，今年的大旱災更是呌他們要活不得，要死不能。</p>
<p>但是人總是要活下去，活的方法也總是有的。就是災荒，有時甚至亦能帮助窮人。例如水災，牠固能塡沒千百萬畝的良田美地，但牠也能造成不少可耕的荒地。「開荒」這件事也大可以養活一部份的平民。我們安慶附近各縣近年就盛行着這種「開荒」的事。</p>
<p>荒地的成因大槪是這樣的：上游山地農家爲了免掉凍餒，總得想盡方法多收得一點活命的糧食；於是本來是長着柴草雜樹的山腰，山丘，山　，山麓等荒野僻地，也都種上了一些玉蜀黍，高粱，山薯，綠豆，花生，芝蔴……之類的雜糧。山中沙土全給刨鬆了，一遇大雨，沙水泥漿就會像瀑布一般的順流洶湧而下，這激流又以巨力冲洗了河邊巨量的沙泥，統統給帶到下游來。這結果自然是很不幸的塡埋了農民許多肥沃的土地，河身淤塞，有時甚至整個的沼澤和小的湖泊都全給塡平了。安慶西鄕在近年就有小湖給塡平過。有些大的湖泊也在一天天的變小。河身也有這種情形。著名的發源於英霍二山的皖水近十多年來也早變得淤塞不堪，一到秋末冬初，就連最小的般也難得暢行無阻。而河的兩邊却長起了不少的「沙洲」。這種　「沙洲」　每年越塡越大，同時河底河身却越塡越低越窄。農民的良田美地沒有了，他們的目光自然就注視到這種「天賜」</p>

<h3 id="e17">South Hungarian Relations After the Marseille Tragedy - Heng <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The fundamental cause of the Marseille tragedy lies within Yugoslavia. I have already said this before. However, the location of the perpetrators' organization is abroad. Therefore, in the wake of grief and indignation, the Yugoslavs suspected that neighboring countries were instigating and directing the attack, resulting in two waves of demonstrations, first against Italy and then against Hungary. In this gloomy international environment, such waves were added, and it is not unreasonable to regard them as a fuse for a second war. However, if we carefully examine the current international relations in Europe, we will know that the key to whether the Marseille tragedy can become a fuse for war seems to lie elsewhere.</p>
<p>Judging from the tense state of affairs between the South Hungarian countries in the past few days, there is indeed the possibility of a war breaking out at any moment, but based on the facts, the poor relations between the two countries have a long history. Today's tense state of affairs between the two sides is the result of accumulated mutual hostility and suspicion in the past. Because of this, every unfortunate incident occurs, and the national psychology immediately suspects the other party. Therefore, before the truth of the matter has been clarified, the people have already expressed their indignation. If we make a brief study of the past bad relations between the South Hungarian countries, we can understand how this kind of psychology is formed. Before the Great War, Austria-Hungary often adopted a divide-and-rule policy towards the Slavs, and was especially jealous of the union of Croats and Serbs. Therefore, it used every means to sow discord between Serbs and Croats. For example, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria even had a plan to organize an Austro-Hungarian tri-ethnic empire to suppress the Slavs. As a result, the Croats became relatively close to Austria-Hungary, while their fellow Serbs became estranged. This is the first reason for their mutual suspicion. By the time the European war broke out, most Croats were forced by the Hungarians to fight against the Serbs on the battlefield. Although they agreed to merge in 1917, it was difficult for there to be no resentment between the Serbs and Croats. Nor were the Hungarians without lingering affections for the Croats. This is the second reason. After merging with Serbia, the illusion of full autonomy was destroyed by Greater Serbianism. Therefore, their exiles used Hungarian territory as a refuge. It is only natural for the Hungarians to use them, and even without factual evidence, it is difficult to dispel the suspicions of the Yugoslavs. Moreover, the perpetrators' organization was established in their territory, and they pretended not to know it, which is internationally indefensible. This is the third reason. In addition, since the Treaty of Trianon was signed, the Hungarians have always regarded treaty revision as their primary goal. The Little Entente and Yugoslavia under the Versailles system naturally felt extremely uneasy, especially after the union of Italy, Austria, and Hungary. Since their psychology was already like this, their nerves were easily stimulated. This is the fourth reason. Furthermore, judging from the dispute between the two countries that was brought to the League of Nations this spring, it is known that the Hungarians have indeed tolerated the activities of the Yugoslav terrorist party in the past three years, and the Yugoslavs have also killed 15 Hungarians. As such, it is naturally difficult to achieve mutual trust between the two countries. This is the fifth reason. With these five reasons, plus the assassination of Alexander today, even if the Yugoslavs do not suspect the Hungarians of deliberately tolerating it, how can they? Moreover, at this time when France and Italy are trying to get closer, the Croats' actions are to take the opportunity to sabotage. Even the Hungarians are not without suspicion of instigating and directing it. Therefore, the Yugoslavs' anger towards Hungary is indeed a necessary action.</p>
<p>However, whether a war can arise from this is not something that the South Hungarian countries can decide. Yugoslavia and the Little Entente should follow France's lead in this matter. In today's Hungary, it must follow Italy's will. If Italy is unwilling to support it, the Hungarians have no power to be tough on the South. In the past, Mussolini often sang the tune of revising the treaty. If this proposition could be thoroughly implemented, then today's events would be unpredictable. Who knows that when the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian alliance was established, Mussolini avoided making a clear statement on this point, and has not mentioned it at all in recent months. This means that Mussolini has no need or obligation to help Hungary on the issue of treaty revision in principle. In other words, Hungary can hardly hope for Italy's assistance in today's events. This is the first reason. Secondly, in recent years, Albania has become increasingly hostile to Italy. Italy has lost this outpost in the Balkans, and it is difficult to penetrate Yugoslavia. This is the second reason. The third reason is that after the establishment of the Balkan Pact, Yugoslavia's position is more solid. The fourth reason is that because of their common position against Germany, Italy is eager to improve relations with France. The Franco-Italian agreement and the visit of the South King to France that were reported earlier are steps to improve Franco-Italian and Italian-Yugoslav relations. Furthermore, judging from Mussolini's tolerant attitude towards the South today, it can be seen that his intention is still to strive to improve Franco-Italian and Franco-Yugoslav relations, thereby laying the foundation for peace in Europe. Therefore, judging from these points, Italy will definitely not help Hungary to oppose the South. If Hungary does not intend to help, then even if it is not satisfied with the South, it will inevitably forbear in many ways to maintain peace. Therefore, it is obviously too early for the outbreak of a war at this time.</p>
<p>According to recent telegrams, the Little Entente regards the Marseille tragedy as an international crime and will protest to Hungary or bring the matter to the League of Nations. At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister also intends to meet with Mussolini, etc. It is likely that the Hungarians, considering the seriousness of the situation, are specifically asking Mussolini for advice on how to deal with it. If our previous observations are not greatly mistaken, then Mussolini will inevitably implicitly advise the Hungarians to calm things down and appease the people. And the method will be nothing more than that from now on, the Hungarians will strictly crack down on the terrorist organizations of the Croats.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Conclusion of Legislative Yuan's Discussion on the General Principles of Criminal Law <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Second Reading Passed for Chapters Three and Four</p>
<p>Chapter Five's Scope of Additional Punishments to be Redrafted</p>
<p>Few Support Restoring Banishment</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued its general assembly on the morning of the 20th at 9:00 AM. Sixty-eight committee members including Lin Bin and Tao Xuan attended. Chairman Sun Ke announced the meeting open and continued deliberating on the Criminal Law Amendment. Because there were no major changes compared to the current law, the committee members had no disputes, and the second reading of each article in Chapter Three, "Attempted Crimes," and Chapter Four, "Accomplices," was passed. Then, Chapter Five, "Additional Punishments," was discussed. Huang Youchang said that before starting the article-by-article discussion of this chapter, could we first conduct a general study on the various points regarding additional punishments? The chairman granted permission. Huang then continued, stating that the amendment changes the current law's provisions on deprivation of public rights to only the loss of civil servant qualifications, and that the loss of other qualifications should be stipulated separately in various relevant laws, which is sufficient to indicate that there is no need to list them. He believes that these provisions are too narrow in scope, and that it would be better to follow Article 56 of the current law, which systematically lists the qualifications of those deprived of public rights in separate clauses. Furthermore, the amendment adopts the current law's item on civil servants, while other items such as electors and candidates are stipulated in other regulations, which is scattered and difficult to implement. Jiao Yitang said, please restore our country's ancient system of banishment. It is flexible and convenient, and the continental countries use this system effectively. Historically, criminals were often exiled to the borderlands, allowing them to atone for their crimes through meritorious service. Furthermore, everyone is calling for the development of the Northwest. If prisoners could be transferred to the borderlands, it would not only defend the country but also engage in production. The chairman then spoke, discussing the opinions of Huang and Jiao separately, and designated that Huang's opinion be studied first. Zhao Chen and Xi Chaojun strongly advocated maintaining the amendment, stating that the scope of deprivation of public rights is not fixed, and the provisions in the criminal laws of various countries also differ. One of the reasons for the amendment is that the scope of the term "public rights" is too broad, so it is stipulated that only the qualification of civil servants is lost, but not their public rights. This is to emphasize the consistent spirit of the articles. Luo Ding, Zhu Hezhong, Qiu Ying, and Cheng Zhongxing then spoke successively. Wu Jingxiong said that there are two solutions to this problem: (1) do not add any provisions at all, as the qualifications of civil servants are limited by the Examination Yuan and the Qualification Law, and the state also believes that criminals are not qualified to be civil servants; (2) list them separately according to the current law. If an elector is a petty thief and a candidate is a major thief, it would be inappropriate not to include electors and candidates in the provisions. Wei Tingsheng said that the provisions of the current law should be followed, because the purpose of deprivation of public rights is to cut off the livelihood of criminals, which is the same as confiscation. The amendment only limits civil servants, so wouldn't it mean that those who do not work as civil servants can still retain all their qualifications? Therefore, he advocates that the scope of loss of qualifications should be broad rather than narrow. The criminal law is a fundamental law, and the main point of the amendment is to have other laws and regulations for the loss of various other qualifications, which is uneconomical in legislative affairs. Lin Bin said that the number of people deprived of public rights and qualifications is actually unexamined and uncounted, which is practically inconvenient. The current law stipulates the qualifications of lawyers. Lawyers are freelancers, the same as accountants and doctors. If we adopt a listing method, there will be omissions. In terms of elections, the determination of election qualifications and the nature of elections are different. What circumstances allow one to be elected, and what circumstances do not? This can be stipulated in detail in the election law. Furthermore, not allowing teachers to teach because of crimes is not a good way to select talent. For example, a scholar may have made great contributions to academia, but should not be prevented from teaching just because he is a gambler and commits crimes. Chen Changheng said that the principle of legislation is that people should be equal under the law. Deprivation of public rights only stipulates civil servants, and other electors and candidates are not included, which is theoretically untenable. Lou Tongsun also advocated that the scope of people whose qualifications are lost should be broad. Wang Yuxiang said that teachers should focus on character education and that textbook education is secondary. Furthermore, unscrupulous accountants can commit fraud, and doctors can sell morphine. It would be inappropriate not to include them. At this point in the discussion, the chairman spoke, suspending the discussion and putting it to a vote. Forty-nine of the sixty-eight committee members present expressed their agreement to redraft the scope of additional punishments. It was then passed that the chairman would designate the Criminal Law Committee to redraft it and submit it to the general assembly for discussion again. The discussion then began on Jiao's proposal on whether to adopt the banishment system. Liu Guanxun said that banishment is a way to alleviate the death penalty. For example, a prisoner's crime deserves the death penalty, but there are extenuating circumstances, or this person is useful and can be punished by banishment. Chen Changheng said that civilized countries do not have banishment. If prisoners are exiled to the borderlands without restraint, the borderlands will never have peace. Not only will they not be able to defend the country, but they will also affect immigrants. Furthermore, the borderlands are adjacent to foreign countries. If prisoners who commit murder and arson collude with foreigners to become traitors and communists, the harm will be even greater. Therefore, organized countries should not have such outdated and impractical actions. Zhu Hezhong said, please look at Siberia. It used to be desolate, but because of the military conscription policy, the Trans-Siberian Railway was completed, and it gradually prospered. Furthermore, there are border guards stationed in the border areas, so how can prisoners rebel? He Sui said that bad people are all seduced by society. Exiling prisoners to the borderlands and forcing them to work and engage in development can not only lead to production but also allow them to reform themselves. Prisoners are not unrestrained, so there are no problems with public security. Li Zhonggong said that some committee members advocate restoring banishment in order to develop the Northwest and strengthen the border defense. In our observation, it is the opposite. The border areas are adjacent to foreign countries. Although prisoners are guarded by troops when they arrive in the border areas, the soldiers' knowledge is not as good as the prisoners'. Is it possible that the prisoners' instigation will lead to overall deterioration? There are many vagrants in the country who have no clothes and no food. Why not transfer them to the borderlands to engage in development instead of sending prisoners to the border areas, which will cause future troubles? Huang Youchang said that this issue can be discussed separately. He extremely agrees with immigration and the development of the Northwest, but he does not approve of restoring banishment. Zhang Zhihan said that the people of the border areas are innocent. Defending the country requires people who know shame to be brave, to understand shame and to be taught to fight. Traitorous prisoners who do not know shame are extremely heinous. Exiling them to the border areas is dangerous. At this point in the discussion, because it was noon, the chairman announced a recess, and the discussion would continue in the afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan convened at 2:30 PM on the 20th to continue discussing Jiao's proposal on whether to adopt the banishment system. Dong Qizheng spoke first, saying that the banishment system means releasing prisoners, which poses a risk of undermining the effectiveness of the criminal law. Zhao Naichuan and Shi Weihuan both said that it is inappropriate to list banishment as one of the main punishments. If a method of replacing imprisonment is stipulated in the execution law, its effect will be greater. Therefore, transferring prisoners to develop the border is the most important plan today. Luo Yunyan said that the banishment of religious offenders from England to the Americas resulted in the birth of the United States. The banishment of political offenders from Russia to Siberia resulted in the October Revolution. Because those who are banished are rejected by the current society, they often harbor resentment against the current society, so there is the disadvantage of starting anew and breaking away from the motherland. At the same time, from a humanitarian standpoint, it is also unbearable not to subject criminals to the imprisonment they deserve, but to send them deep into the frozen wilderness to endure an inhumane life. Many European and American countries have abolished this system. The chairman put Jiao's proposal to a vote, and few supported it. With the exception of Articles 34 and 36 in Chapter Five, the entire chapter was passed in the second reading according to the amendment. The discussion then continued on Chapters Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, and Twelve. With the exception of Item 8 of Article 50 in Chapter Seven being retained, and Article 62 in Chapter Eight being amended by Wu Jingxiong to add a second item, "This article does not apply to those under the age of eighteen who commit the crime in Article 267, Item 1," the rest were passed in the second reading according to the amendment. The first part, the General Principles, was discussed to completion. The chairman, due to the lateness of the hour, announced the adjournment of the meeting and scheduled to continue the discussion at 10:00 AM on the 22nd. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan passed the newly added chapter on protection measures in the first part, the General Principles of the Criminal Law, in the second reading on the 20th. It also passed that the number of days of detention before the determination of jurisdiction should be offset by one day for one day of fixed-term imprisonment or detention.

<h3 id="e20">Farmers Riot Outside Loumen, Suzhou <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Fourteen Houses of Tax Collectors Burned Down</p>
<p>Over a Thousand People Set Out to Make Trouble</p>
<p>(Suzhou) Due to the drought this year, the farmland in various townships of Wuxian County has not received rain for three months. Therefore, the affected fields amount to more than 200,000 mu. The county government is currently dispatching personnel to the townships to conduct on-site surveys. However, a week ago, a disaster relief committee member went to Xietang Township to survey the famine and was surrounded by farmers. After persuasion by the district chief and others, they dispersed. The disaster-stricken farmers in the Loumen outer townships hate the tax collectors because they falsely reported the famine and extorted money from the farmers. Suddenly, at around 7:00 AM on the 20th, more than 1,000 farmers gathered and set out to make trouble for the tax collectors, actually implementing a riot and burning down the houses of the tax collectors. Fortunately, the tax collectors had received prior notice and had fled in advance, otherwise their lives would have been in danger. According to the investigation, fourteen houses were burned down, including those of Yan Yisheng, Shen Yuanxiang, and Yang Xinsheng in Xietang Township, Zhu Fuchang in Nanhengjing Village, Shenjing Township, outside Loumen, and Qiu Zigen, Qu Hengshan, and Chen Zishan in Xiatang Village, Waikuatang. After receiving long-distance telephone reports from the township chiefs at 9:00 AM, the county magistrate of Wuxian immediately dispatched Xu Yibai, the head of the First Section, along with Nie Dezhao, the attached officer of the Seventh Security Brigade, leading the security team, on a motorboat to the townships to repeatedly persuade the farmers and explain the advantages and disadvantages. The farmers then dispersed. The disturbance was concluded, and Section Chief Xu and others returned to the city in the afternoon. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Suzhou) The farmer riot in Xietang outside Loumen has not yet subsided. The losses in the affected townships amount to tens of thousands of yuan. It is now heard that the same situation has occurred in Chefang. Tonight, the authorities are investigating the truth of the riot. Meanwhile, the Farmers' Association has sent an urgent telegram to the province. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Former President Xu Shichang has been living in Tianjin for several years, entertaining himself by writing calligraphy, composing poetry, and painting, and enjoys collecting antiques and has a large collection of books. In recent years, he has been compiling the "Qing Confucian Learning Cases," which has now been completed and is being printed and will be published within the year. The 20th was Xu's eightieth birthday, and many of his students and former colleagues came to Tianjin to congratulate him. Xu scheduled a tea party for the guests at his private residence at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, but did not host a banquet. Last year, rumors spread that Xu was involved with a puppet organization, but Xu dispelled the world's doubts with the saying, "What more can an eighty-year-old man seek?" His wisdom and tranquility are evident. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The 20th was Xu Shichang's eightieth birthday, and nearly six hundred of his former colleagues and students went to congratulate him. Central Committee member Fang Juehui, Yan Huiqing, and Cao Kun personally came to offer their congratulations. Yan Xishan, Huang Fu, and Wu Peifu also sent representatives to Tianjin. Xu usually lives frugally and did not host a banquet on this day, but only provided tea and snacks to the guests and gave each person a personally written couplet as a thank you. Because Xu does not like extravagance, the gifts from various parties were mostly ancient inkstones, brush sets, and ancient books. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>The Little Entente and Balkan Pact Nations</p>
<p>Meet in the Yugoslav Capital</p>
<p>Decide to Maintain Current Policies</p>
<p>(Belgrade) The Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries (Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania) convened this morning, and the Political Conference of the Balkan Pact countries (Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece) convened in the afternoon. Both issued communiques in the evening, with completely identical wording. First, they expressed condolences to Yugoslavia and France, and then stated that this conference (the Political Conference of the Little Entente countries or the Political Conference of the Balkan Pact countries) had studied the situation of the Marseille tragedy, believing that this matter was a crime of international politics, because the forces to which the perpetrators in Marseille belonged were outside the borders of the two countries, South France. The communique also stated that the purpose of the recent terrorist acts was to undermine the internationally established position of certain countries, or to cause certain already unified countries to lose their important figures. Therefore, this conference believes that all countries should cooperate peacefully, tranquilly, and objectively in order to ascertain the responsibility for this case and demand that necessary measures be taken to prevent such acts from happening again, because if such acts occur again, serious conflicts will inevitably arise. This conference hereby declares that, despite the occurrence of terrorist acts, the current policies of the Entente countries (Little Entente or Balkan Pact) will remain unchanged. All Entente countries have become even closer in their relations since this tragedy, and they promise two things: first, each country should strictly implement its treaty obligations in the future; second, each country should continue to pursue the policies it has implemented to date without any slackness, and strive for cooperation and rapprochement among the countries, in order to complete the unfinished business of former Yugoslav King Alexander and former French Foreign Minister Barthou. All countries will forever be loyal to the policies left behind by the two men. The decisions of the Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries have been approved by Romanian King Carol and Yugoslav First Regent Prince Paul. The communique issued by the Balkan Pact Political Conference was read by Greek Foreign Minister Maximos at the meeting, who also stated that the Balkan Pact Political Conference is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting on October 30 of this year. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Belgrade) The Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries and the Political Conference of the Balkan Pact countries both issued communiques last night. Political circles are very satisfied with the results of the two conferences, and it is said that the wording of the communiques issued by the two entente conferences is completely identical, and the expression of their interconnected relationship is obvious. A group has been formed from Czechoslovakia in the north to Turkey in the south to jointly maintain peace, which is completely in line with French policy. Former Yugoslav King Alexander's policy of rapprochement with Bulgaria will also continue to be maintained. Romanian King Carol and Yugoslav First Regent Prince Paul have the same opinion on this matter, which is particularly noteworthy. Prince Paul also declared to Czech Foreign Minister Benes when he received him today that he will continue to pursue the foreign policy pursued by former King Alexander. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Marseille) The pre-trial judge handling the assassination case of Yugoslav King Alexander has requested the Italian authorities to transfer Pavlovic, the leader of the terrorist group arrested in Turin, for interrogation. It was previously reported that Pavlovic had resided in Marseille at the end of last month, but it is now known that this is inaccurate. The person residing here is actually another law-abiding Romanian citizen with the same surname as the leader of the terrorist group, leading to the misunderstanding. According to news from the city of Annacy, a station employee in the area immediately recognized Pavlovic's photo and said that Pavlovic bought a train ticket to Bergat, a place on the Swiss border, on the 4th of this month.

<p>(Yugoslav Capital) The family history of Cavatnic, the important member of the Croat terrorist party arrested in Turin, Italy, yesterday, has been investigated. Cavatnic's grandfather was a famous revolutionary during the reign of Napoleon III, who demanded broad autonomy for the Croats under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Cavatnic's maternal grandfather is Dr. Frank, the leader of the extreme faction of the Croat Autonomy Party. This faction demanded autonomy before the European War and still advocates forming Yugoslavia into a federation, including Bulgaria, and granting the Croats autonomy within the federation.

<p>(Belgrade) The cabinet resigned at 11:00 AM this morning. According to the constitution, the cabinet should resign after the death of the king. Therefore, the cabinet had already resigned once the day after King Alexander was assassinated in Marseille, but the regency government retained it. Now that the funeral of the late king has been held, the cabinet will be reorganized starting this morning. Prime Minister Wu Shinovich went to the Dediye Palace this morning to submit the resignation of the entire cabinet. Political circles believe that the regency government will choose one of two solutions: first, invite the opposition parties who expressed their loyalty when the king died to join a centralized cabinet of all parties. If this fails, then a non-political cabinet will be organized by officials. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Says Treaty Abolition Still Requires Two Years of Obligation</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese negotiations for the naval preliminary conference are scheduled to begin on the 23rd. Japan's established policy is to present its disarmament policy and propose the abolition of the Washington Treaty. Japan proposes to unilaterally abolish the treaty if its proposal cannot be agreed to by other countries. Japan also intends to conduct the preliminary conference through bilateral negotiations, opposing a roundtable conference. (Japan Union News dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan will notify its intention to abolish the Washington Treaty. Britain and the United States have misunderstood this, believing that Japan will immediately carry out military expansion and even increase its fleet. In order to dispel this misunderstanding, the Imperial Government intends to clarify Japan's policy before notifying the abolition, that is, the Imperial Government will strictly abide by its obligations during the two-year period of the treaty's continued validity, as stipulated in Article 23, and will not build ships or expand its military.

<p>(London) Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira and Rear Admiral Yamamoto, the representatives participating in the preliminary naval talks, visited U.S. representatives Norman Davis and Chief of Naval Operations Standley this afternoon. The visit was only of a social nature. The Japanese representatives only explained the general outline of their country's naval policy, which was roughly the same as what Yamamoto had announced to the press. Norman Davis plans to return Yamamoto's visit tomorrow. As for the date of the formal U.S.-Japan negotiations, it has not yet been decided. The U.S. and Japan are unlikely to hold talks before the separate Anglo-Japanese and Anglo-American negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Japanese newspapers recently published news that the Tokyo government intends to propose a non-aggression pact among Britain, the United States, and Japan in the Far East. British officials and Americans have stated that this news has not been verified and that whether or not this pact is concluded, even if it is only considered, the Soviet Union and the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty must be consulted. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Associated Press has learned that the outcome of the naval talks may be a five-power naval treaty based on a semi-total tonnage system. According to this plan, countries will be allocated total tonnage for medium and light ships, such as cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, while the allocation of special tonnage will be limited to battleships, heavy cruisers, and aircraft carriers. The signatory countries can freely build cruisers, destroyers, and submarines within the tonnage limit. According to reliable sources, Japan wants to propose a complete tonnage system. In view of Britain's opposition, Japan is using a semi-tonnage system as a compromise solution. It is heard that Britain may support this proposal. It is also learned that although the naval policies of Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy do not coincide, they all hope to find a final solution. (National News dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Washington) American aviator Hawks stated today to the local aviation committee that the United States should promptly deploy defensive works in the Aleutian Islands to contain potential attacks from the Far East. Hawks recently spent several weeks in China demonstrating aircraft to the Chinese government and is now summoned by the committee to present an air defense plan for the government to consider. Hawks claimed that the deployment of defenses in the Aleutian Islands near the Alaskan coast is as important as the fortifications in the Hawaiian and Philippine Islands. He also stated, "With the advancement of flight equipment as it is today, I can fly from Tokyo or Shanghai to New York in forty-eight hours. If America's enemies are in the Far East or the Soviet Union, this can also be done. Japanese aviators, after flying out, do not care whether they can fly back. Japan currently has many young warriors who are willing to sacrifice their lives to bomb and destroy the skyscrapers of New York." Furthermore, according to an official of the Sikorsky Company, which is responsible for the Pan American Airways trans-Pacific seaplane, the aviation committee was told that the realization of scheduled trans-Pacific air service is only a few months away, and the seaplanes to be used will be delivered soon. The company's technicians are currently making final arrangements for the maiden voyage in a few weeks. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e31">U.S. Purchases Silver from India <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(New York) The New York World Telegram commented today that India may replace China in selling silver to the United States. The Chinese government's export tax will severely impact silver exports. India's silver reserves are approximately 8,000,000,000 ounces. Washington announced today that in the week before October 12, the value of silver purchased by the United States in the world market was US$2,011,984, of which US$829,245 was purchased from Mexico, US$570,237 from China, and US$248,408 from the United Kingdom. In the previous week, the total value of silver purchased was US$2,542,462. Experts believe that Finance Minister Kung Hsiang-hsi's recent statement indicates that the Ministry of Finance will continue its policy. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The liberal "Economist" magazine commented on the impact of the rise in silver prices, stating that "the Chinese government's move to devalue silver is not a remedy for the current situation. However, the continuous outflow of silver reserves from China, or an excessive appreciation of Chinese currency, is also sufficient to have a significant impact. This is very clear because, from a purely economic perspective, Chinese commerce will rapidly stagnate to the point of bankruptcy, and its purchasing power will also be greatly reduced. From a political perspective, the current consolidated position of the central government may weaken as a result, and bandits and communists will become more active. In summary, China will inevitably use all possible methods to prevent the artificial rise in currency prices. This is very obvious. We hope that China can use the silver export tax as a weapon and maintain it for a long time so that it can have a real effect. However, one issue must be considered: Chinese currency and silver have almost declared 'divorce.' Once this idea penetrates the minds of ordinary Chinese people, will they continue to trust the national currency? Based on the above, we hope that President Roosevelt and his advisors will carefully consider the pros and cons before taking any action on the silver issue to avoid making repeated mistakes that cannot be remedied."

Veterans also gathered here today, and President Roosevelt urged veterans across the country to "expedite what should be expedited," meaning that the disabled, sick, and poor who cannot make a living should be taken care of. The President also told the veterans that countless people in the country do not enjoy the right to this type of hospital, so he hoped that the veterans would not only think of themselves but would also assist the government in its broader policies so that millions of men, women, and children without clothing, food, medicine, or education could also be rescued.

<p>From London to New Gold Mountain, a Distance of Ten Thousand Miles</p>
<p>Twenty Aircraft Take Off Separately</p>
<p>Speed and Obstacle Categories, Let's See Who Wins the Championship</p>
<p>(London) Twenty aircraft representing six countries departed from Mildenhall Aerodrome today for New Gold Mountain in Australia, marking the largest air race in history. Each aircraft took off at intervals of approximately one minute. The first aircraft took off at 6:30 AM, and the last aircraft left the ground at 6:47 AM. All aircraft flew directly towards Australia. Three aircraft competed in the speed race, ten aircraft competed in the speed and obstacle race, and seven aircraft competed in the obstacle race. The United Kingdom participated with six aircraft, the United States with three aircraft, the Netherlands with two aircraft, Australia with two aircraft, New Zealand with two aircraft, New Guinea and Denmark with one aircraft each. The Irish monoplane was disqualified due to being overweight. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>

<p>(Mildenhall) The air race was held here at 6:30 this morning. At that time, there were twenty aircraft, departing from England for Melbourne, each determined to break the previous record of flying 11,300 miles. By four in the morning, there were already thousands of spectators at the airfield. Mr. and Mrs. Mollison departed first amidst cheers. Subsequently, an aircraft took off every forty-five seconds, so within seventeen minutes, all twenty aircraft had completely left the departure point. Sir Powel, representing the Lord Mayor of London, was the flag bearer, holding a red flag and standing in the field. The pilot of the fifth aircraft, Stack and Tennler, failed to take off immediately after the red flag was raised and returned to the starting line, thus losing thirteen and a half minutes. It was later learned that Stack and others intended to return to take the photos taken at the time of departure and carry them to Melbourne in the aircraft. The Dutch aircraft took off after a short taxi, like a bird. However, the British aircraft Comet took off a little unevenly, and when the wheels left the ground, the fuselage almost reached the edge of the airfield. The aircraft Vega, piloted by Miller and Huch, was the twelfth to depart, due to a misunderstanding of the signal, taking off ten seconds early. They thought they could depart when the flag was raised, but they didn't know they had to fly when the flag was lowered. This error will be corrected in Singapore, but it does not contain any penalty. Most of the participants will make their first landing in Marseille. In addition, some plan to make their first landing in Rome, Bucharest (the capital of Romania), Baghdad, and Athens. The weather was overcast this morning, and visibility was normal, but the weather in the English Channel is expected to be good. However, the weather in continental Europe is not very good and will only improve when it reaches Turkey and Asia Minor. From four in the morning, people from all directions came to Mildenhall Airfield in an endless stream, like water flowing into a ravine. Men and women wore evening dresses, singing and dancing in the field to pass the time. The air was filled with joy, because in a moment there will be a great spectacle to feast their eyes.

<p>(London) After the aircraft of the England-Australia Air Race departed from Mildenhall Aerodrome at dawn today, four aircraft had landed in France, either due to bad weather or engine damage. The rest proceeded smoothly. The aircraft that flew the farthest today was the Douglas DC-2 aircraft piloted by Parmentier and Moll of the Netherlands, which landed in Rome at 11:30 AM, exactly five hours from the time of departure. Several aircraft also passed through the Marseille checkpoint in the morning. The aircraft piloted by Stack and Tennler landed in the town of Abbeville near the mouth of the Somme River in northern France, sixty miles from Calais. According to Stack, they had to land due to heavy fog and now hope to continue after refueling. The remaining three aircraft landed in a small town near Paris, one landed in Beaujolais, and one landed near Beaujolais, but all hope to continue flying as soon as possible. The first aircraft to pass Marseille today was Vega, which landed at 10:24 AM and took off again at 10:50 AM. Another two aircraft, one landed in Marseille at 11:15 AM and resumed after thirty minutes, and one landed in Marseille at 12:08 PM. One American aircraft stopped briefly in Lyon at 11:05 AM.

Everyone thought that Fitzmaurice had completed all the preparations for the competition and might fly to Australia alone to compete with the other aircraft.</p>
<p>(London) An Irish aircraft withdrew from the England-Australia air race due to a dispute over the amount of weight carried. According to the pilot, Colonel Fitzmaurice, he does not care about the 10,000-pound prize, but he is willing to demonstrate the capabilities of his aircraft. He now plans to take the aircraft to the Croydon Aerodrome for a landing test. After obtaining a certificate, he will fly to Australia as a private individual, taking the same route as the competitors, in order to beat the winner's time. He now hopes to depart on Sunday and take the route of the competitors to beat the winner's time. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Repeatedly Made Outstanding Achievements in the European War</p>
<p>(Berlin) German General Alexander von Kluck, who repeatedly made outstanding achievements in the European War, died of illness in the German capital this morning at the age of eighty-eight. General Kluck participated in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 and later participated in the Franco-Prussian War from 1870 to 1871. He had a long military career and endured many battles. When the European War began, he was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the German First Army on the Western Front, responsible for offensive and defensive duties on the right wing. After winning consecutive victories in Maubeuge and Saint-Quentin, he personally led a large army to set out for Paris. This was one of the most thrilling events in the history of the European War. At that time, the German army was only twenty miles from Paris. If it were not for the Battle of the Marne, which stopped the German advance, the French capital would have become rubble. Later, Kluck's army retreated to the Aisne River defense line. He was seriously injured while inspecting the front-line trenches in March 1915. In October 1916, Kluck was unable to perform his arduous duties due to his declining health and retired. He wrote a book entitled "The March on Paris and the Battle of the Marne," which is a valuable historical material of the European War. The following is a record of his life and achievements: General Alexander von Kluck was born on May 21, 1848, in the city of Münster in Westphalia. His father was a public architect in the area. After graduating from school, he joined the 55th Infantry Brigade as a junior officer. In 1866, he followed General Vogel von Falkenstein to the Inn River. From 1870 to 1871, he participated in the Franco-Prussian War and was wounded twice near Metz, receiving the Iron Cross. Later, he was appreciated by Kaiser Wilhelm II and became the commander-in-chief of the Berlin Militia District. In 1909, he was awarded the title of baron and became a member of the nobility. Subsequently, he served as the commander of the 34th Brigade, the commander of the 23rd Army Corps, and the commander of the 37th Division. Later, he was promoted to the commander-in-chief of the 1st Guards Infantry Division. In 1913, he was appointed as the inspector of the 8th Army District. In the European War, he led the First Division to advance rapidly westward. He encountered the French army in Mons and won a great victory. Later, he defeated the British army in Saint-Quentin. In the Battle of the Marne, the enemy army, under the command of General Gallieni, planned to make a large encirclement, but Kluck unexpectedly broke through the encirclement by attacking against the besieged city. However, on the Aisne River front, he was injured by shrapnel and became chronically ill, eventually having to retire. In 1928, the University of Jena awarded him an honorary doctorate. In 1924, for his golden wedding anniversary, such a meritorious military figure, with such a long life, followed Hindenburg underground, which can be said to be an honor.

<p>(Tianjin) On the 19th, 150 bandits suddenly appeared in Tong County, fully armed and equipped with a mountain gun. After being intercepted by the local security team, the bandits were unable to enter the county and turned back, fleeing towards the border between Miyun and Shunyi. Along the way, they looted various villages, set fire to and destroyed many houses, and kidnapped dozens of men and women. The police and militia made every effort to pursue them, and the bandits fled again to Niulanshan in Shunyi County, resisting stubbornly by relying on the terrain. The people's militia of the three counties of Miyun, Shunyi, and Huairou have launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression, surrounding the bandits in the mountains. On the 19th, another 100 bandits passed through the border between Huairou and Miyun and fled into Pinggu County. The people's militia of Miyun and Pinggu counties divided their forces to intercept them, and the bandits fled back to Hanxinzhuang in Huairou, passing along the Bai River, Luoshan, Daxinzhuang, and Liushuizhuang, all of which were burned and looted severely.

<p>(Tianjin) Salt is everywhere in the three counties of Luan County, Fengrun, and Leting, and the people mostly make a living by boiling salt. Recently, the tax police have been cracking down on illegal salt very severely, and conflicts have occurred from time to time. Afterwards, they were either resolved through mediation or sent to court, fortunately without escalation. Recently, due to the tragedy in Zhengjiawan, Luan County, the people's hatred of the tax police has become even more intense. More than a hundred tax police were stationed in Zhengjiawan. A few days ago, they learned that Zheng was making a living from a salt field and arrested Zheng. The people of the area believed that Zheng was not a salt bandit and went to the team to petition. The team released Zheng, and the people gathered outside the door again, shouting slogans. The tax police opened fire to suppress them, and the order was greatly disrupted. Two people died and five were injured. Afterwards, various villages received reports and united more than 2,000 people, heading straight for the team. The tax police were afraid that the situation would escalate and had no choice but to withdraw and telegraph the security team, saying that it was a riot by the villagers and asking them to come and suppress it. The security team rushed to the scene the next day and began to quell the situation. The villagers are now accusing the tax police at the Salt Transportation Office and various agencies, demanding that the murderers be punished. The Luan County Local Court is currently resolving the matter in accordance with the law. The two tax police who caused the incident have also been sent to court for detention pending trial.

<p>Complete Recovery Possible Within Two Months</p>
<p>(Xiamen) A military official in charge spoke to a Central News Agency reporter, stating that with the successive capture of Shicheng, Ruijin, and Xingguo, the bandits have no foothold on the borders of Jiangxi and Fujian. Within two months, the entire bandit area can be recovered. Only an empty city remains in Changting. There will be no problem for the Eastern Route Army to enter and garrison. However, because the bandits are implementing a scorched earth policy against us, our army must first prepare a sufficient supply of rice. Currently, after the vanguard advances to Hetian, they are engaged in urgently building rear highways. Once the road is open and transportation is smooth, they will advance further into Changting. The Jiangxi bandits are at the end of their rope and can be completely annihilated. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Interior explained two points of doubt regarding the execution of the regulations on autonomous districts, townships, and towns: (1) Trampling on other people's fields falls within the scope of civil mediation.

As for punishment, whether it be a fine or labor service, it concerns the people's property and bodily freedom. The head of the district, township, or town has no right to execute it directly. (2) As for loafers and idlers, they can be persuaded, but the head of the district, township, or town does not have the power to order them to work. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>A Record of Inspecting the Northwest, by Our Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<h3 id="e109">Gansu Province Construction Projects <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Gansu Province's construction projects are in urgent need of active implementation. Areas like water conservancy, transportation, mining, and land reclamation all require substantial resources to effectively develop the province's strength. However, considering Gansu's finances, the vast expenses of military and political affairs, and the long-standing deficits in the provincial treasury, it is difficult to develop these construction projects sufficiently. As the province is a key center in the Northwest, critical for national defense, the central government, with foresight, urgently needs to develop the Northwest and provide assistance for construction. This is a crucial task. The past and present situation, and future plans for Gansu's construction projects are described as follows:</p>
<p>Lanzhou City is the capital of Gansu Province and is located in the center of the country. Its population is increasing year by year. According to a recent survey by the Public Security Bureau, there are a total of 19,773 households, with 96,009 people, including 59,990 males and 36,019 females. However, due to traffic congestion, various aspects are relatively backward. The Eurasian airline route has just established a station here, and the province's six major highway project also takes this place as its center. Land and air transportation are expected to gradually develop. Therefore, improving city roads and rectifying the city appearance are urgently needed. The Construction Department's recent plan for repairing and constructing city roads is roughly as follows: (1) Road system: The existing streets will be widened selectively, creating a grid layout, and as many radiating lines as possible will be added within a possible range to expand outward from the center. The main lines are planned to be developed in four directions, using the square at the north entrance of Zhongshan Avenue as the center: east to the Great Drill Ground, west to Xiaoxihu Lake, south to Wuquan Mountain, and north to the south bank of the Yellow River, connecting with the Gansu-Shaanxi highway main line via the Nan Guan and Dong Guan main streets, reaching the airport. In addition, branch lines will be appropriately opened to serve as connections. (2) Engineering plan: The principle is to use locally sourced materials. Bricks and stones produced in the city can be used for the entire foundation. Strip bricks and rectangular small stone strips are the best materials for paving sidewalks and express lanes. However, limited by economics, crushed mountain stone is used for the pavement. Open ditches will be built on both sides of the driveway to drain sewage. The main and branch lines of the city are 43 kilometers long, requiring a total estimated construction cost of 1,077,200 yuan. In addition, a private water company is being planned and discussed along the river.</p>
<p>Gansu Province has a woolen mill, originally called the Woolen Fabric General Bureau, which was established by Zuo Zongtang, the governor of Gansu, in the early years of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. The initial investment was 2 million taels of silver. Later, Peng Yingjia, the Lan Shan Daofu, continued to run it. Due to poor production and excessive expenses, it gradually became deficit-ridden and eventually closed down. Later, local gentry, such as Deng Long, raised funds to organize a joint public-private venture, renamed the Woolen Fabric Company. However, without effective reorganization methods, it soon closed down again. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, the provincial government took it back to continue running it, but production and sales were not developed. By the 19th year, it was closed again, and the factory's machinery was transferred to the Construction Department for safekeeping. In April of the 20th year, the provincial government planned to allocate funds to restore it, but it ultimately failed due to the provincial treasury's financial constraints. In the 21st year, the Construction Department drafted a method of attracting merchants for joint operation, but due to the impact of local finance, wealthy merchants did not dare to invest, causing the factory's vitality to be completely lost and restoration was difficult. Now, the Construction Department believes that the restoration of the woolen mill is essential, considering the province's flourishing animal husbandry and abundant wool production. Recently, in addition to requesting the provincial government to allocate funds for its restoration, it has also assigned technicians to supervise craftsmen to repair the machinery so that it can be restored as soon as possible to revitalize the industry.</p>
<p>Transportation is the beginning of all construction. Therefore, the development of the Northwest is generally considered to focus on transportation. Gansu's transportation has always been blocked, causing all industries to lag behind. In order to actively promote construction, the authorities first drafted a plan to build highways throughout the province, divided into six major lines: 1) Gansu-Shaanxi Line: from Gao Lan through Yu, Dingxi, Jingning, Longde, Pingliang, Jingchuan to Yaodian; 2) Gansu-Xinjiang Line: from Gao Lan through Yongdeng, Gulang, Wuwei, Yongchang, Shandan, Zhangye, Linze, Gaotai, Jiuquan, Yumen, Anxi to Xingxingxia; 3) Gansu-Qinghai Line: from Gao Lan to Xiangtang; 4) Gansu-Ningxia Line: from Gao Lan through Jingyuan to Zhongwei; 5) Gansu-Sichuan First Main Line: from Gao Lan along the Gansu-Shaanxi Line's Mengjiabao through Tongwei, Qin'an, Tianshui, Chengxian to Chengdu; 6) Gansu-Shaanxi Second Main Line: from Gao Lan through Tao Sha, Lintan, Minxian, Xigu, Wudu to Bikou, etc. Currently, only the roads from Lanzhou to Xi'an, to Xining, to Anxi, and to Ningxia are barely passable by cars. The rest are nominally borrowing cart roads and urgently need fundamental construction.</p>
<p>Gansu Province is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, with vast land. However, due to the arid highlands, there is no way to irrigate, and the desert extends for thousands of miles, making remediation difficult. Gansu Province has over 6 million people, and farmers account for 80-90% of the population. It is no wonder that these innocent people often experience drought. The solution is to dredge canals, manage ditches, and enable elevated land to receive irrigation. In this way, barren land will become fertile, people's livelihoods will be resolved, and it will also benefit the future management of the Yellow River. The general situation of water conservancy in Gansu Province is described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Rainfall: Gansu's climate is dry and droughts are frequent. Although there are no precise measurements of annual rainfall, according to recent surveys, the middle area has about 18 inches (Lanzhou's annual rainfall is only about 11 inches according to actual measurements), the eastern area about 15 inches, the southern area about 20 inches, and the western area about 16 inches. However, the person in charge of the Lanzhou Tianzhu, entrusted by the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory to conduct weather observations, said that the average annual rainfall in Gansu is only three inches (note: a normal rainfall of less than 18 inches cannot result in a good harvest and requires irrigation). Its inadequacy for farmland is obvious. If water conservancy irrigation and afforestation are not carried out to regulate the climate and increase rainfall, Gansu's farmland will undoubtedly become barren.</p>
<p>(2) Rivers: All major rivers north of the Yangtze River pass through Gansu Province, such as the Yellow River, Jing, Wei, Tao, Han, Zhang, Rui, Dang, Sha, Qingshui, Heishui, Datong, Zhuangdu, Longtan, Shule, Lin, Guo, Baiting, Huanjiang, Dong, Bei, Zhusha, as well as the Jialing, Bailong, and Liangjiang rivers, crisscrossing like a spider web. However, the water flow is rapid, making it difficult to open canals for irrigation. Therefore, the remains of garrison farmland canals from the Qin and Han dynasties can be found everywhere.</p>
<p>(3) Waterwheels: In nearby counties of Gansu Province, waterwheels are occasionally built as tools for drawing water for irrigation. However, they require a lot of effort and have little effect. The current number of waterwheels in each county is: Yongjing 53, irrigating 9,639 mu; Jingyuan 24, irrigating 10,800 mu; Gaolan 176, irrigating 29,710 mu; Taosha 1, irrigating 100 mu, totaling 254, irrigating 50,249 mu.</p>
<p>(4) Completed canals: Lintao County has 12 canals, including Deyuan, Gongzhen, Yongning, Fumin, Xinmin, Tao Hui, Liulin, Haoshui, Jiehe, Gaihe, Bayang, and Cuiwan. Tianyong County only has Tonghui Canal, which opens a canal at the Shangxiakou Nanwan of the county, leading the Wei River to the Shangxiakou Heiyaowan, which is 6,000 meters long, irrigating more than 1,000 mu. Other counties, due to the names of the canals are not detailed, the total number of completed canals in the province is about 170, irrigating about 2 million mu.</p>
<p>(5) Unfinished canals: Lintao County has four canals, including Puji, Jisheng, Mona, and Dongyu. Yongjing County has canals such as Yongfengchuan and Lamachuan. When these two counties' unfinished canals are completed in the future, they can irrigate more than 90,000 mu of farmland.</p>
<p>(6) Proposed canals: Lintao County has canals such as Minsheng and Anchuan. Gaolan has canals such as Xingu and Dajiachuan. Wuwei has canals such as Tao La, Yan Gan, and Er He. Longxi County has Longxi South Canal. Jingtai has Heimaquan River Canal. Yongdeng has Honggucheng Canal. Pingliang has Pingliangchuan Canal. There are Jinghe and Ji He canals in Chuan. Tianshui has the Weihe River Dike, guiding the Longhe River. Jingning has Kushui River Canal. If all the unfinished and proposed canals in the above counties can be completed, the total estimated project cost will be 1.7 million yuan, and it can irrigate more than 600,000 mu of farmland. Calculating an increase of three yuan per mu per year, the total annual income of farmers will be more than 2 million yuan. For this rural economy, which is increasingly declining, it is no different from obtaining a good medicine for revival and restoring its prosperity.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Autumn Floods in Guilin Become a Disaster <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Flooding in Guilin Rivers Causes Severe Disaster</p>
<p>Flooding in Rivers of Western Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Since the beginning of autumn, there has been more rain than sunshine in various parts of Guilin Province. At the beginning of this month, there were even hurricanes and rainstorms, and the water levels of the rivers rose simultaneously. In the Nanning area of Guilin Province, on the night of the 2nd of this month, the weather changed suddenly, with hurricanes and heavy rain. Mountain floods broke out in various counties. The most severe were the following counties: Longzhou: On the morning of the 2nd, there was torrential rain, lasting for several days and nights. The river water rose to 26 feet. Shangsi County: Heavy rain on the 2nd, non-stop throughout the night. Many houses of residents near the city collapsed, and fields were washed away. Long'an County: Wind and rain on the 2nd and 3rd, non-stop all day. The river water rose by three meters. Xunzhou: The upper and southern rivers both rose by nine feet four inches. Yujiang River: From the 2nd to the 4th, the water rose by eight meters and two centimeters. On the 6th, it continued to rise by eight centimeters. Beiliu River: The water level suddenly rose by four feet on the 3rd, three feet on the 4th, and one foot on the 5th. Dahe River: The water rose by one foot on the 3rd, three feet on the 4th, and three feet five inches on the 5th. Mingjiang River: The water rose by three zhang four chi on the 3rd, and five feet again on the 4th. Fields near the county seat and in the Zhaian Township area were all flooded, and the autumn harvest was hopeless. More than 200 rural power poles were uprooted. Ningming County: From the 1st to the 2nd, there were gales and heavy rain, lasting for two days and nights. Trees were uprooted and houses collapsed everywhere. Newly built public offices and school buildings in various villages of Kuitang Township collapsed. The autumn harvest is hopeless. The above-mentioned disasters in various counties are unprecedented in the past ten years. Yesterday, the Wuzhou Civil Aviation Airport was also flooded, and the Southwest Civil Aviation planes have been grounded for several days.</p>
<p>After the inundation of various places along the river in Guilin Province, the West River in Guangdong Province, originally the tail of the Guijiang River, has been receiving floodwaters flowing eastward from Guilin Province in recent days. The first to suffer are the counties of Gao Yao, Gao Ming, De Qing, and San Shui. The enclosure management committees of the above-mentioned counties immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss ways to rescue the embankments. It was resolved that on the 16th of this month, the Gao Yao Gao Ming Thirteen Enclosure Flood Prevention Committee would be established to actively handle flood prevention work. Unfortunately, from the 8th to the 13th, the lower reaches of the West River were again subjected to continuous wind and rain. The wind aided the water's force, so the counties from Deqing to Sanshui became a vast flood. Gao Ming County suffered the most severe disaster. The San Zhou enclosure under the county's jurisdiction has been flooded, and the embankment is in imminent danger. All rice fields have been submerged in the water. On the evening of the 12th, the flood flooded to the southeast gate of the county seat, and the suburbs became a swamp. In addition to leading personnel to find ways to prevent flooding, the county magistrate urgently telegraphed the River Management Association, requesting that engineers be sent to the county to jointly rescue the dangerous embankments.

<h3 id="e111">Henan Province Expands Long-Distance Telephone Service <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>This Year Adds Zhengzhou-Xuchang, Shangye, Yanwu Lines</p>
<p>Kaifeng dispatch: Henan Province's long-distance telephone service has been gradually set up in recent years with the stability of the political situation and the pacification of banditry. By the end of last year, there were 59 trunk and branch lines, totaling more than 8,230 li in length. According to the director of the bureau, Yu Zehou, this year the Zhengzhou-Xuchang line has been erected and repaired, the Shangye line completed, and the Yanwu, Xinwu, and Nanxi lines have been added. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhengzhou-Xuchang Line: Originally, there was a telephone line between Kaifeng and Xuchang, with a length of 180 li, but it was attached to telegraph poles. Because the inductive force between the two lines was very strong, the sound of the call was often mixed. In addition, the telegraph bureau was urging to move the line, so new poles were re-erected according to the original line, and new lines were re-hung to avoid the problem of mixed sound. The bureau dispatched the director of the Zhengzhou branch, Guo Jingqi, to lead the work on March 1 of this year. By March 16, the entire line was completed. Since the call was made, it has been exceptionally clear.</p>
<p>Shangye Line: Shangcheng to Yejiaji, a distance of 140 Huali, was dispatched to Huangchuan branch director Liu Shancheng in November of the 22nd to lead the work erection. The project started from the 30th of that month to December 15 erected to Wumiao set. Because of the bandit, the project was suspended in the middle. It was not until March 6 of this year that the erection continued. The entire line was completed to March 20, but it is difficult to maintain in that area. According to a recent report, the line was destroyed again by the bandits.</p>
<p>Yanwu Line: From Luohe (i.e., Yancheng) through Wuyang to Ye County, the mileage is 160 li. The required material funds for the original long-distance telephone were apportioned equally according to the number of miles in each county, but because the material funds that Ye County should have apportioned have not been paid, the bureau sent Zhang Zengrong, director of the Kaifeng Nanguan Business Office, to lead the work on June 6 of this year. The section from Yancheng to Wuyang will be set up first. By June 15, the line was completed and the call began. Once Ye County turns over the required apportioned money, the entire line of Yanwu Ye can continue to be erected to complete it.</p>
<p>Xinwu Line: Xinyang to Wusheng Pass is a distance of 105 Huali. South of Wusheng Pass, it enters Hubei Province. In order to complete the Henan-Hubei combined line to facilitate communication, a clerk, Xie Shaozhen, was dispatched in June of this year to lead the work. The erection started on the 14th of that month, and the entire line was completed on July 2. It is connected to Guangshui. Now, Xinyang and Hankou can talk directly.</p>
<p>Nanxi Line: The erection of the Nanyang-Zhenping-Neixiang-Xichuan long-distance telephone is necessary for bandit, so as to connect with Yun County in Hubei Province so that the news can be well informed. In addition to the Nanyang-Zhenping section, the bureau had originally erected a line. From Zhenping to Neixiang, it is ninety Huali; from Neixiang to Xichuan, it is 140 Huali. Because it is necessary to connect with Yun County, it was erected to the small Sailing, the border of this province, after reaching Xichuan. There are forty Huali. The bureau sent Zhang Zengrong, director of the Kaifeng Nanguan Business Office, to lead the work on July 22 of this year, and it was completed on September 13. Because the internal line in Yun County, Hubei Province, has not yet been erected, the joint call between the two provinces still needs to be waited for. (18th)</p>

<h3 id="e113">Songjiang County Government Convenes Autumn Survey Conference <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The county's agricultural products are mainly rice and cotton, and farmers depend on them for their livelihood. The prosperity of industry and commerce is also based on the abundance of agricultural harvests. There was a severe drought in the summer of this year, and the rivers were dry and shallow. Farmers bucketed water day and night, working tirelessly and sufferingly, lamenting the worry of drought and famine. Fortunately, during the flowering and fruiting period in autumn, there were continuous showers, and the rice and cotton, which had been on the verge of extinction, began to recover. The county government previously received instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs and Finance to investigate the famine, and instructed the district offices to survey and respond. After the two departments sent commissioners to re-survey, the county government convened district chiefs and relevant groups at 10:00 a.m. today (20th) to hold an autumn survey conference. The county magistrate presided over the meeting, and Wang, the commissioner of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Li, the commissioner of the Department of Finance, attended together, reporting the re-survey process. After discussion, except for the sixth and seventh districts, which had good harvests, the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth districts were generally reduced by 20%. The eighth district is a coastal area, and the famine is more severe. It is approved to generally reduce it by 60%. It is proposed to submit it to the provincial government for approval.</p>

<p>Sun Lanqin, a farmer from Heyingtang, Fourteenth District, Fengjing, died suddenly in the field. His nephew, Songgen, reported it to his aunt, who reported it to the Second Branch, which reported it to the court for inspection. At that time, the deceased's son, Songpo, suddenly disappeared, and there was a suspicion of fratricide, or that father and son were killed at the same time. Yesterday, the court sent someone to inspect the body, and found that the deceased's temple was injured by bricks and stones, and there were fatal injuries on the chest and ribs. The blood flowed all over the ground, and the situation was terrible. It was learned that the deceased's daughter saw that her brother, Songpo, was stained with blood, suspected him, and reported it to her stepmother, who asked the Second Branch to arrest and escort Songpo to Songjiang. The county Public Security Bureau is now preparing a document to transfer him to the county court for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Provincial Department of Finance sent Yu Peng to Nanhui the day before to assist the Chuanhui Feng Business Tax Bureau in actively handling the collection of the provisional business tax as the new cotton is on the market. Yesterday, the member visited County Magistrate Yuan to discuss the county's assistance procedures.

If anyone still fails to comply after the 12th of this month, the tax bureau will report it, and the police will be dispatched to pursue it.</p>

<p>Yao Awu, a villager from the Shangliutu Village, Twelfth District, Huchuan Township, First District, is engaged in farming. The day before, he had a verbal quarrel with his neighbor, Chen Wu. Chen A Yu, the 15-year-old son of the woman, saw that Awu and his mother were arguing endlessly, so he took a kitchen knife from his own kitchen and slashed Awu in the head when he was unprepared. Suddenly, blood gushed out and he fell to the ground unconscious. The Huchuan Public Security Police Station, which is in charge of the area, arrested the murderer and sent him to the General Bureau along with Chen Wu and the injured person, and transferred him to the county government. The assessor Shen Cheng opened a criminal court to try the case, examined the wounds, ordered him to seek medical treatment outside, and the murderer Chen Axing was detained, and Chen Wu was released on bail pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Shi Junqing, chairman of the Wu County Chamber of Commerce and senior advisor to the Jiangsu Provincial Business Federation, served the community diligently and tirelessly. He died of illness due to overwork at 3:00 p.m. on the 18th. Yesterday afternoon, the funeral was held. The County Chamber of Commerce has notified all industries that the entire business community will lower the flag to half-mast for one day to express their condolences. The fire brigades in each district of Suzhou will each send a delegation of 20 members to pay their respects. After Shi Junqing's death, the County Chamber of Commerce immediately convened an emergency meeting and appointed Standing Committee Member Pan Ziqi as the acting chairman, and a by-election will be held at a later date. Shi Junqing started his career in the silk and satin industry. In recent years, due to the decline of the silk and satin industry, there have been annual losses, so his family's situation is not as good as it used to be.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Wuxi Telegraphs Request to Reduce Stamp Tax Rate <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce of this county telegraphed the Nanjing Central Political Conference yesterday, requesting a reduction in the stamp tax rate, stating that the stamp tax law decided by the Legislative Yuan stipulates that invoices and money receipts of three yuan to ten yuan should be affixed with one point, and thereafter one point should be added for every ten yuan, up to a maximum of one yuan, which is a hundred times and fifty times higher compared with the current stamp tax regulations, which stipulate that invoices should be affixed with one point and all kinds of money receipts should be affixed with a maximum of two points. The fifth article of the principle of the stamp tax law passed by Junhui last year stipulates that "taxes should be levied heavily on documents with greater validity or rights, or longer usage time, and taxes should be levied lightly on documents with lesser validity or rights, or shorter usage time," and the sixth article stipulates that "commonly used documents should be taxed at a fixed tax rate that is simple and easy to implement, while documents for rare acts should be taxed at a progressive tax rate that is easy to calculate," which is obviously inconsistent. It is found that the validity period of merchants' invoices and receipts is extremely short, but the tax rate is increased by hundreds or fifty times compared with the current tax rate, and the books are also doubled compared with the previous ones, which merchants cannot afford. The principles decided last year should be quickly corrected.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Questionable Verification of a Smoker <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Hua Juchu, the Chief of General Affairs at the local Tobacco and Alcohol Public Sales Inspection Office, had a long-standing addiction to opium and was a heavy smoker for over twenty years. When the county's anti-smoking association organized the registration and licensing of smokers, Hua did not register and obtain a license as required. Consequently, Wang Zuogeng, a vendor, reported him for privately smoking opium without a license, and he was brought to the Public Security Bureau, transferred to the county's anti-smoking association, and sent to the county's addiction treatment center for verification. As the center lacked the necessary equipment, an observational verification method was used, lasting seven days. During this period, Hua smoked cigarettes all day, chewed on pumpkin seeds until his mouth foamed, and consumed supplements such as "Chrysanthemum Brand" milk, cod liver oil, and ginseng, as well as pears, appearing extremely distressed, indicating signs of addiction. However, after the observation period, yesterday, the Director of the County Addiction Treatment Center, Gu Zengliang, reported that Hua showed no signs of addiction. Subsequently, Chairman Yan instructed Hua Hongtao, the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the anti-smoking association, to hold a hearing and rigorously interrogate Hua Juchu about his time at the center. Hua admitted to purchasing and consuming cigarettes and supplements. When questioned, the informant, Wang Zuogeng, insisted that Hua was a long-time addict and deemed the county addiction treatment center's verification inaccurate, declaring in court his intention to appeal to the provincial authorities for a re-examination of Hua's addiction. Consequently, Wang Zuogeng was temporarily detained, while Hua Juchu was released on bail with a reliable guarantor, pending referral to the provincial authorities for re-examination and handling. Hua Juchu's report was the first since the county's ban on smoking, making it a matter of significant public attention.</p>

After meeting with Secretary Bao of the County Government, it was decided that starting from the 19th, they would first inspect the townships under the first district, and then inspect the wasteland in each district. After returning to the provincial government, they will average the most and least severely affected fields in each district to determine the autumn harvest.</p>

After concretely deciding on the principles the day before yesterday, all working steps have been decided after repeated secret talks between the three representatives, Bei Songsun, Xi Demao, and Zhang Peishen, since the evening of the day before yesterday. As this work has no fixed form and requires temporary and flexible response, it will be handled by the three parties through consultations at any time when it begins. The organization and detailed rules have been drafted by Bei Songsun and will be formally approved after being discussed again by the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications today. The committee's fund of 100 million yuan has been decided to be borne by the Central Bank and the Bank of China, each responsible for 40 million yuan, and the Bank of Communications responsible for 20 million yuan. Funds will be allocated to each bank at any time within the prescribed limits as needed. When necessary, the total amount of funds can be negotiated and adjusted at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Ministry of Finance Bears Subsidy for Losses <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>This time, the banks formed the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee entirely under the supervision and entrustment of the Ministry of Finance. However, its operating activities are of an independent nature, and its work policy is also different from that of general commercial entities. Therefore, it will not hesitate to suffer losses under special circumstances in order to maintain market stability. However, the Ministry of Finance has agreed to subsidize these losses. According to the general inspection of the banking industry, it is said that if the foreign exchange balance work is handled properly, there will be no losses.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Main Functions of the Foreign Exchange Committee <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>According to a banker familiar with exchange rate trends who spoke to reporters yesterday morning, after the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, its main function is to stabilize the domestic silver market so that there will be no sudden rise or fall. That is, when the price of silver dollars falls, the Stabilization Committee will buy silver dollars and sell US dollars or shillings to raise the price of silver. Conversely, if silver dollars skyrocket, it will release silver dollars and buy US dollars and shillings to suppress the degree of the surge, in order to keep the silver market and exchange rate at an appropriate level. Another banker observed that it is expected that the government will lower the domestic currency price to a ratio of five to one with the US dollar in order to help the export of domestic products. However, it is feared that if the price of silver dollars suddenly plummets, our exporters will inevitably be disadvantaged. Therefore, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee will be used to make it progress gradually and avoid special impacts.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance originally intended to include other China Commercial Banks in the organization of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, in addition to the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. Therefore, when Minister Kong convened a meeting the previous morning, Chen Guangfu of Shanghai Bank, Li Fusun of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and others also participated in the discussion. Now, for some reason, the final decision was made to only organize the committee jointly by the Central Bank and the other two banks. According to the Shen Shi News Agency reporter's interview with leaders of various China Commercial Banks yesterday morning, they all expressed that although the private China Commercial Banks will be slightly affected in terms of foreign exchange business, they unanimously expressed their support for the government's approach, considering the overall Chinese financial market. They said that if the foreign exchange stabilization work can be carried out effectively, it is expected to achieve quite satisfactory results. Most foreign banks were unwilling to express any opinions.</p>

<p>Since the increase in the silver export tax, the mark gold price has been greatly affected. The opening price yesterday morning at 9:00 was 980 yuan and 5 jiao. The lowest price fell to 976 yuan, and then rose to 990 yuan. The closing price at 12:00 noon was 999 yuan, an increase of 13 yuan compared to the closing price of 986 yuan the day before. The Central Bank's balance tax rate was listed yesterday morning with an additional balance tax of 10.25%, which was 0.25% lower than the day before. The balance tax rate the day before was 10.5%.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Financial Leaders Deny Rumors <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Inflation is Not a Fact</p>
<p>Devaluation is Also Untrue</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance increased the export tax on silver, prices have risen sharply, and transactions on various exchanges have been very active. On Thursday, the price of gold rose to 1,020 yuan, and other commodities such as yarn, flowers, flour, etc. also experienced huge price increases. However, when comparing the supply and demand of spot goods with the transactions in the market, it seems that the distance is still far. All this is due to rumors that my country will also devalue its currency, inflate the currency, or even switch to the gold standard, so they regard buying mark gold, foreign exchange, or other goods as a shortcut to getting rich, resulting in drastic changes in the market. After the newspapers published the statement of the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance on Friday, clarifying that the government would not abolish the silver standard or ban the export of silver, the rumors of abolishing silver and using gold were swept away. However, yesterday there were rumors that it was possible to devalue the currency to inflate the currency, causing anxiety again. The reporter asked a banker about this, and it was said that he had just met with financial leaders and inquired about this, and he now knew very well that there was absolutely no such thing as devaluing the currency or inflating the currency. Although there are many rumors these days, they are all speculations by general speculators and are not credible.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Huge Customs Revenue After Silver Tax Collection <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>A Total of More Than 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Paid by the Bank of the Netherlands</p>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs was ordered to collect silver export tax, the bulk export of silver dollars by foreign banks in this port on the 16th has stopped and has been returned to each bank for storage. Only the Bank of the Netherlands still loaded a batch of silver for export after the tax collection order was issued. The amount was not large, totaling about 2 million yuan. The bank first paid a 2.5% export tax, and then paid an additional 7.5% and 5.25% new tax, totaling more than 170,000 yuan for the new tax, combined with the already paid 2.5% tax, totaling more than 200,000 yuan. After the customs collected this tax rate, it was allowed to ship the bank's silver to the United States. This is the first batch shipped out of Shanghai after the silver tax collection balance tax and the first huge tax revenue income of the Jianghai Customs since the issuance of the silver tax collection.</p>

<p>The war in Xinjiang Province has gradually subsided. Li Rong has now succeeded Liu Wenlong as the chairman of the provincial government of the province. Li was originally the Commissioner of Xinjiang and the Administrative Commissioner of Dihua. He met with him when he went to Xinjiang last time and was very shrewd in handling affairs. As for the reason for Liu's resignation, there is no political relationship. The saying that he was detained by Sheng Shicai is probably not true. Since Liu was appointed as the chairman of the province, he felt that he was old and frail, so he repeatedly and firmly resigned from this position to the Central Government. As for the construction within Xinjiang Province, it has now been decided to proceed separately. The Xin-Sui Road from Xinjiang to Suiyuan was badly damaged due to the war. It has been repaired and officially opened to traffic.</p>

<p>Price Differences Have Been Covered by Entrusted Gold Firms</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the mark gold market has soared in recent days since the Ministry of Finance increased the silver export tax, so some speculators have suffered huge losses. On the 19th, Dekang Gold Firm suddenly went bankrupt. It is learned that Yiju Shenzhuang in Tianjin has also closed down one after another. The notice from the gold exchange is recorded below. According to Yuqingyong, Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Dingtai and other gold firms, Yiju Shenzhuang in Tianjin had entrusted them to sell mark gold in succession.

<h3 id="e149">Lifting the Ban on Rice and Grain in Shashi <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Telegraph Urges Shanghai to Send Ships for Loading</p>
<p>The Shashi authorities, yielding to telegram requests from the local Chamber of Commerce and various sectors, have lifted the ban on exporting rice. This has been approved, and starting from October 21st, rice can be loaded and shipped out. Rice merchants from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui have been notified and are rushing to Shashi for procurement and transport. A large quantity has already been purchased and finalized, awaiting loading onto ships. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received urgent telegrams from Shashi, roughly stating: After the ban on rice exports was lifted, there is a significant amount of rice awaiting transport in Shashi. Foreign merchant ships are already competing to secure loading contracts. The telegrams requested that Chinese merchant shipping companies in Shanghai quickly dispatch a large number of iron barges and 1,000-ton, shallow-draft river steamers to Shashi to transport large quantities of rice to Shanghai. Currently, companies such as China Merchants and Sanbei are preparing to send ships for loading. However, as Shashi is located upstream on the Yangtze River during the low-water season, the water level is minimal in the section between Chenglingji and Jianli, making navigation difficult. For example, the heavily loaded Yongsheng vessel of the Yongan Company ran aground near Jianli and is currently being lightened and towed to safety. The Yongsheng vessel has a deeper draft and is not suitable for navigating the middle section of the Yangtze River. It is common for unregulated ships to be stranded upstream during the dry season. According to the company, the hull of the ship is undamaged. According to shipping industry sources, the first batch of Shashi rice is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month.</p>

<p>Imposing a 5% Disaster Relief Donation</p>
<p>Purchasing from Outside the Province Is No Longer Economical</p>
<p>Anhui Province, due to the severe drought this year, had previously restricted the export of rice and grain to maintain local food security. However, the central government believes that food regulation is a matter of national importance and did not allow the ban to continue. Therefore, the ban was lifted on the 15th of this month. However, to provide relief to disaster victims, a levy of five sheng per shi (equivalent to 5%) is collected on grain transported to other provinces, to be used for disaster relief. Since this regulation was implemented, the price is no longer competitive. Procurement from other areas is no longer profitable because the cost is similar to the selling price. As a result, no Anhui rice has been shipped to Shanghai so far.</p>

<p>Opposing the Municipal Council's Increase in Hotel Taxes</p>
<p>Requesting a Ban on Impersonating Soldiers and Selling Goods Along the Way</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent letters yesterday to the Public Concession Municipal Council, opposing the increase in hotel taxes, and submitted a petition to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, requesting a ban on impersonating soldiers and selling goods along the way. The two letters are excerpted as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e156">Opposing the Increase in Hotel Taxes <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Esteemed Sirs, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Hotel Association requesting that we negotiate with the Municipal Council to abolish the increase in property taxes. We agree. Property tax collection should be based on property deeds and should not be arbitrarily increased or disrupt tax collection. There is no reason for this. There have been countless instances of such inflated tax assessments. If your council wishes to increase revenue, it should collect taxes on vacant properties to lower property prices and attract residents, thereby maintaining the market and increasing revenue. Furthermore, it is hoped that you will economize internally, reduce the number of highly paid Westerners, and employ diligent Chinese people in their positions, which would help maintain the budget. This should not be limited to the hotel industry. We respectfully submit this letter for your consideration. Respectfully, to the General Manager of the Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Requesting a Ban on Soldiers Selling Goods <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Petitioning for the investigation and banning of individuals impersonating soldiers and forcibly selling goods along the way. We request that your esteemed headquarters strictly prohibit this to uphold military discipline and national dignity. Our member shops have reported to the association, and the association has sent representatives to investigate. Recently, along the roads of the Chinese Concession, individuals resembling soldiers have been forcibly soliciting and selling goods, with fierce expressions and terrifying appearances, disturbing both Chinese and foreigners. Such behavior damages military prestige and violates military discipline, affecting the reputation of our country's military and disrupting travelers. If this is not strictly prohibited, it will seriously affect national dignity and public image. We respectfully submit this petition to your esteemed headquarters, requesting that you order a strict prohibition to maintain military discipline and uphold national law, for the public good. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>The Pudong area of Shanghai is vast, with numerous factories. The completion of Pudong Avenue has led to an increasing population density. To date, there is no tap water facility, which is crucial for drinking water hygiene and fire prevention. Mayor Wu, recognizing the importance of this, believes that there is a need for active planning. Yesterday, he instructed the Secretariat to send a letter to the Municipal Industrial Trust Society to actively plan for this. The Society, upon receiving the letter from the Municipal Government Secretariat, adhering to the Municipal Government's consistent vision of promoting the prosperity of the city and Mayor Wu's concern for the welfare of the people of Pudong, has already begun preparations.</p>

<p>Hope for Signature After Feisinger Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun," an understanding has been reached between the Chinese side, the Municipal Council, and the Japanese side regarding the establishment of a special zone for cross-border road construction. However, disagreements remain on the details. Because Municipal Council Director-General Feisinger is currently on leave in his home country, negotiations have stalled. On the other hand, the interests of our nationals (Japanese) are significant. This time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched Mr. Sone of the East Asia Bureau to Shanghai to investigate the actual situation. He left Shanghai on the 17th. Consul Sugihara, head of the Consulate-General, has also held discussions on this issue. He will report to Beijing soon. The main points of the negotiation progress are investigated as follows: (1) The issue of the police organization within the special zone; (2) The issue of the scope of the special zone; (3) The issue of public utilities in the special zone. Regarding the issue of the organization of the special police, it is stipulated that in the northern and western special zones, the director-general will be Chinese, the deputy director-general will be Western, and the candidate for director-general will be Japanese. Next is the issue of the scope of the second special zone. There are also clear regulations regarding security and other relationships. However, various difficulties have arisen in practice regarding the method of road demarcation. For example, opinions were presented to the Chinese side on whether to expand or change the scope in a certain area, or to reduce it in another place, and specific plans were discussed. As for the third issue of public utilities, clear regulations have also been made regarding issues such as gas, telephones, water, and fire protection, in order to reach an agreement. All the general outlines have been decided. Once Municipal Council Director-General Feisinger returns to Shanghai, the formal signature can take place.</p>

<p>(8) Bakelite Industry</p>
<p>Bakelite is a newly emerging industry. The first company to be established was the Yaguang Bakelite Factory, founded by Mr. Zhang Huikang. Initially, it only produced daily necessities, such as rice bowls, spoons, basins, and plates. First, it was bakelite, and then it created bakelite jade. Its products were novel, beautiful, and durable, and were well-received by the public. As a result, sales were wide and profits were high. Many businessmen envied its low capital and high profits, and established factories to imitate it. Currently, there are more than ten such factories, not including small factories. As the number of factories increased, competition became fierce, and they competed by lowering prices, even below cost. Therefore, factories such as Yaguang, Shanghai Jiao Mu, and Shanghai Industrial initiated the organization of a trade association. Nine companies joined the trade association. The reporter specially interviewed Mr. Zhang Huikang, manager of Yaguang Bakelite Factory, a leader in the industry. The information obtained from the conversation is briefly recorded as follows: The bakelite jade industry is a newly emerging industry with a history of only four years. Last year's sales were about 500,000 yuan. The products of Yaguang Manufacturing Factory were well received by all parties, so its sales accounted for about half of the total. Chinese people are imitative and lack creativity. Whenever they see a newly emerging industry, regardless of its high or low cost, or wide or narrow sales, they flock to it. The bakelite jade industry also suffers from the same problem. This year, another five or six new companies have opened. They are small in scale and have little capital. They produce crude and shoddy products and operate independently, resulting in chaotic market prices and increasingly fierce competition. The trade association was established on the sixth floor of the Continental Commercial Center. Nine companies joined. The larger companies can still unite, gradually revise commissions, discounts, etc., and the market price is gradually becoming consistent. However, the seven or eight companies that have not joined continue to compete by lowering prices and secretly offering discounts, greatly affecting the business of other factories. Recently, considering the chaotic market prices and the inability of the association to control them, each factory has launched a secondary brand to reduce costs and engage in mass production to compete with other factories. This effort is extremely laborious. The raw materials for bakelite jade are mostly imported from countries such as Germany and the United States. After more than two years of painstaking research, Yaguang Factory is now able to produce its own bakelite raw materials. From now on, the main raw materials will no longer need to be imported from abroad. This can be said to be a good sign for the domestic goods industry. The production of bakelite jade products is relatively simple. However, the mold manufacturing must be accurate and precise, and the mold design must be novel and ingenious. Although bakelite jade work is easy, it is difficult to ensure excellent quality. The upper and lower temperature, the high and low pressure, and the long and short time can all affect the quality. The inferior products on the market, although similar in appearance to the products of superior factories such as Yaguang, are not durable. This is because they cut corners and reduce materials. All aspects of temperature, pressure, time, and composition are without standards. Therefore, inferior goods on the market lose their luster after only a few days of use, and emit an odor when exposed to water, which is a reef hindering the future of promoting domestic goods. Although the bakelite jade industry's products this year seem to be improving day by day, sales have not kept pace. This is because rural areas have gone bankrupt in recent years, and the purchasing power of the public is extremely weak. In addition, competition among colleagues, frequent discounts, and falling prices make the future of production and sales uncertain. Statistics show that among the colleagues, two have closed down within a few months of opening, and several are on the verge of collapse. Most of them overestimate their abilities and covet high profits, leading to a complete failure and no chance of recovery. In this precarious situation, there will naturally be many eliminated within the year. Upon investigation, most of the emerging colleagues are established by general craftsmen who arouse the curiosity of investors. The capital is small and the skills are limited, and the products are limited to simple items such as plates and bowls. These products are already being abandoned by large factories, and they all embrace the principle of small profits and dumping. Small factories suffer a major blow from the beginning, and lack the ability to open up new avenues. They have to sit and wait for death. This is the biggest reason for failure. Currently, the trend in this industry is that large colleagues are actively promoting the scope of application of bakelite jade, and the manufacturing methods are becoming more sophisticated. Small colleagues take on the production of small parts for others, and rely on others to make wedding dresses. Of course, they can only sigh with admiration. However, there is one thing that is gratifying: bakelite jade daily necessities can already replace foreign goods. However, a large number of foreign electrical products are still imported. This industry should actively improve equipment, simplify work, reduce consumption, and promote sales. Then the goal of excluding foreign goods can be achieved. Yaguang's products are becoming more and more refined, so this year's business is not much different from last year. The person in charge is an electrical engineering expert, and the future goal is the manufacture of electrical appliances and motors. Now it has increased its capital to 250,000 yuan and is already preparing for the manufacture of electrical appliances. It will then manufacture motors, which will make a great contribution to our country's ongoing construction.

<p>The People Live on Tofu Dregs and Bran</p>
<p>Deqing County in Zhejiang Province is located in the west of Zhejiang Province, under the jurisdiction of the old Huzhou Prefecture, bordering the four counties of Wuxing, Wukang, Hangzhou, and Chongde. It has always been a silkworm-raising area. In recent years, the silk cocoon harvest has been terrible, and the people have been living in poverty. Nine out of ten families are empty. This is not just a matter of today or tomorrow. This year, there was no rain during the rainy season. From mid-May to the end of August, there was no rain for a total of ninety-eight days. The soil and rocks were scorched, the early rice withered, and most of the late rice could not be planted. The total farmland in the county is 376,700 mu, of which about 75,000 mu had no harvest, about 187,000 mu were seriously affected, and about 114,000 mu had some hope of harvest. The total population of the county is 178,300, of which more than 90,000 are affected by the disaster. The disaster is so great that it is unprecedented in the past hundred years. Currently, the affected farmers live on tofu dregs and bran. Chen Huan, the magistrate of the county, has come to Shanghai to appeal to save the people. Yesterday, Chen County Magistrate was accompanied by Yu Saicheng, Yuan Songfan, Yu Zhongxian, Mo Jilin, and other gentlemen from Shanghai who are natives of the county, to the Chinese and foreign relief associations, the drought relief associations of various provinces, the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, the Lake District Disaster Relief Association, the Red Swastika Society, the Red Cross Society, and other charitable organizations to beg for relief. Each association expressed sympathy and promised to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Song and Han Navigation United Petitioning Delegation's Petition <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Song and Han Navigation United Petitioning Delegation, because the Shanghai Navigation Management Committee ordered the cancellation of the Song and Han Navigation qualification, starting from October 1st, and not allowing service, specially submitted a petition to the central government and various ministries to fight for it yesterday. The original petition stated that it was to use false names, plunder real power, exterminate the inherent powers of the Chinese people, expand the power of foreigners, conspiracies, and harm the country and the people. We urge a thorough investigation and swift prevention. The profession of navigation is related to national defense and military secrets. In all countries in the world, there is almost no example of allowing foreigners to serve as navigators within their territory. Our country, because the Qing Dynasty authorities did not understand maritime affairs and abandoned sovereignty, the navigation of each port was occupied by foreigners, which became a common practice. Currently, the only remaining piece of fruit that can maintain the remnant situation is the Yangtze River line. My colleagues have been practicing here for a long time, like the pioneers. However, over the years, foreigners have been deliberately trying to exclude the Chinese people from the Yangtze River navigation in order to fulfill their extravagant hope of complete monopoly. Threats and inducements have already been used to the extreme. My colleagues have always adhered to the principle of dying rather than letting go. The oppression we have suffered is deeply painful and cannot be fully described. Last year, the government established the Navigation Management Committee in accordance with the purpose of recovering navigation sovereignty. However, the power in the committee is controlled by the maritime customs commissioners, who, in the name of the Shanghai Navigation Management Committee, canceled our qualifications with illegal orders, and did not allow us to serve as before from October 1st. Arbitrary manipulation is nothing more than creating monopoly opportunities for foreigners. This is presented separately to your departments and offices: (1) Chinese Yangtze River navigation has been the earliest profession in history, and the territorial sovereignty belongs to our country. My colleagues not only studied and graduated from the Navigation Training Institute sponsored by the Navy Department and obtained certificates, navigation licenses, and other documents, allowing them to serve, but also each person has been engaged in practical navigation for at least five or six years, and up to one or twenty years. Whether in terms of laws or achievements, there is no reason why they cannot serve as navigators. According to the example, navigation is a public business, similar to the practice of law, and is subject to national restrictions. In addition, within the approved area, they can operate freely. This situation is just like my colleagues graduating from school and passing the examination, all legal qualifications, serving as Yangtze River navigators, is the approved service area. May I ask, what power does the maritime customs commissioner have to prohibit it? (2) The navigation examination law promulgated by the Examination Yuan, its examination power is controlled by the Examination Yuan. Before Rong Qing held the examination, we did not hear of it being approved, and we did not see it being announced after the event, making it impossible to understand its content. My colleagues also went to participate in this examination to explore its inside story. (Omission) Things are like a child's play. The reason for this is that there are other intentions. However, we, in the relationship with our colleagues, are not willing to expose more about the utilization of the Chinese people. One example can be used to infer the rest. (3) Navigators have the right to operate freely. Whether long-term navigation or short-term navigation, the income is not subject to any exploitation. The previous Song and Han Navigation Association was opposed by our people because of the collection of dividends. Now, the maritime customs commissioner is actually intensifying the situation and depriving our colleagues of the right to operate freely. The compensation method they have set is to completely own the income of each person. In the collection of navigation fees, after removing the expenses of the Shanghai Navigation Management Committee, if there is a surplus, a little bit of profit can be shared. The public principle is changed to a monopoly, and you can sit on the ground and divide the spoils without any cost. There is nothing more than this for the so-called business without capital. Furthermore, I heard that the maritime customs commissioner's plan is on the one hand to raise several foreigners so that they have food to eat, and on the other hand to hope for a surplus to offset a certain appropriation. His intention is biased, nothing is more than this. (4) Yangtze River navigation is not monopolized by the Chinese people. There are still foreign navigators of British, German, and Japanese nationality who are in control. If the maritime customs commissioner has no other intentions and focuses on recovering our country's sovereignty, then foreign navigators should be banned first. They cannot be allowed to continue to serve. They reverse the priorities, oppose Chinese navigators, add various restrictions, and create this bad example. Their conspiracies and schemes are like snakes and scorpions. Chinese navigators have a fixed number, which is under their jurisdiction. Why is the foreign part completely let go and allowed to be free? As for the Chinese navigation fee, it is lower than that of foreigners, which is a way to attract foreign business. Now it is deliberately increased. It is clearly to drive away the birds from the bushes, and on the contrary, it is praised as raising the treatment of navigation. The deceiving words can be said to be the heart of Sima Zhao, which is known to everyone. (5) The Chinese people's service as Yangtze River navigators is not obtained by luck. If they are so devastated by the commissioner, it means that the occupations of dozens of our colleagues will be abandoned, which is not a lifelong abandonment, the extinction of life, and the relatives who are waiting to die, what about hundreds of people? Is this kind of evil and absurd act inflicted on the Chinese people? May I ask, is it still bearable in law or in emotion? Now that my colleagues have been placed in a dead end by foreigners, they have no choice but to fight to the death. My colleagues are based on illegal and unfair reasons. One is that it is greatly contrary to our country's purpose of recovering navigation. Secondly, the examination power is related to our country's internal affairs. How can foreigners overstep the bounds and make plans for us? Moreover, in Yangtze River navigation, there are still the positions occupied by British, German, and Japanese foreigners. Why does the maritime customs commissioner not ban them and only target our Chinese people? He examines under the false name of the committee, arbitrarily dismisses them. If he does not correct them immediately, then in the future, the maritime customs commissioner will use the false name of recovering navigation to plunder real power. Unless the Chinese navigation is completely ruined. In short, foreigners have a hundred and one tricks to exclude the Chinese people, to protect their own kind, and to be as poisonous as snakes and vipers. My colleagues have been oppressed by this, and they have to fight absolutely and consistently. For this reason, we have listed the facts and respectfully ask your departments and offices to review and approve them, and to swiftly order the maritime customs to abolish the previous selection and restore the old navigation personnel to serve together, in order to protect sovereignty and maintain the whole. This presentation is to the National Government, the General Staff Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Navy, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Communications, presented by the Song and Han Navigation United Petitioning Delegation.</p>

<p>Coal Barge Industry Association Requests Assistance from the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Coal Barge Industry Association of this city sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that according to reports from member boat companies in the north and south of the city, coal freight rates in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been chaotic recently. Some coal merchants have even demanded that boat owners reduce freight rates, otherwise they will refuse to load coal. If unforeseen circumstances occur en route, boat owners will be required to compensate, placing boat merchants in a situation of utter ruin. They requested prompt relief. Upon receiving the letter, it was submitted to the joint meeting of the 13th session of the second council of executive and supervisory committee members for discussion. It was generally agreed that the association's coal freight rate list for Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was formulated based on social living conditions and cost accounting and had been submitted to and approved by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau for implementation. All members of the industry in the city were notified to comply in order to safeguard their business. The association had previously sent a letter to your esteemed chamber, requesting that you forward it to the Coal Industry Association of this city, notifying all coal companies, which is on record. Given the aforementioned situation, the chaotic freight rates are a matter of concern for the entire boat industry. After deliberation, it was decided that if coal merchants hire boats to load coal without adhering to the association's freight rate list, boat owners will not be responsible for any unforeseen circumstances that may occur en route. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is requested to send another letter to the Coal Industry Association, notifying all coal merchants for their information, which is on record. Accordingly, this letter is sent for your review and prompt approval and forwarding in order to maintain commercial transportation, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e171">The Case of Embezzlement by the Accountant of the China Coal Ball Company Awaits Further Summons <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Wu Zhensheng, an accountant from Shaoxing employed by the China Coal Ball Company at 26 Dixiwei Road, had been working for the company for five years. He resigned last winter. In March of this year, a shareholders' meeting revealed that he had embezzled silver taels 3,000 and yuan 8,499.16 between September 23, 1930, and January 27 of last year. Yang Zhuang, a Ningbo woman and shareholder, reported the case to the Hongkou Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Wu and bring him to the First Special District Court. Wu testified that the money had been used by the deceased major shareholder, Li Futang, a Ningbo native. Li Yao, Li Futang's wife, appeared in court and admitted that she would be responsible for it. However, the shareholders stated that there were still discrepancies in the accounts handled by the defendant. Wu was ordered to pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan and released pending further investigation after the accounts were clarified. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zeshan presided over a continued hearing in the third criminal court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, recounted the events, stating that the case needed to be adjourned because the truth of the accounts could not be determined immediately. Jiang Baoli, a lawyer representing the plaintiff, stated that Li Futang, a shareholder, had established the Houde Coal Company at the time and transferred more than 50,000 yuan from the China Coal Ball Company for his own use. When questioned about whether the defendant had appeared on time after being released, Fan Gang, the defendant's lawyer, stated that the accountant hired by the plaintiff had a family relationship with the plaintiff and was likely biased and unable to handle the matter impartially. Therefore, the client also wanted to hire an accountant to allow both parties to calculate the accounts in detail and hope for fairness, etc. Judge Wu ordered the defendant to pay the original deposit and adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of the 30th for further verification.</p>

She resembled a female student, approximately 20 years old, wearing a purple plaid woolen Western suit, dark blue woolen pants, light pink silk stockings, and white canvas rubber-soled running shoes. She was quite sturdy, likely a victim of an accidental fall into the river. The Paotaiwan police station of the Wusong Police Station discovered the body and reported it to Chief Fu. Since no family members could be found and there were concerns of other circumstances, the 35th district guarantor, Pu Yuxiang, was specially ordered to report the matter to the Shanghai Local Court and request the dispatch of personnel for examination.</p>

<p>Crushed to Death... Died on the Road... Suicide by Poison</p>
<p>At the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Datong Road in Zhabei, at approximately 7 p.m. the night before last, a No. 9545 coal truck traveling from west to east was delivering coal to the Qianyi Glass Factory. Unexpectedly, while passing the entrance of Chengren Lane, it was unable to avoid a young boy, who was knocked down and had his head crushed by the wheels, resulting in immediate death. Officer Shi Ze'en of Post No. 42 learned of the incident and immediately sent the driver responsible for the accident, along with the coal truck, to the Taiyang Temple Police Station for transfer to the Xinzha Public Security Bureau. At the same time, guarantor Wang Shaoting reported the case to the Shanghai Local Court yesterday for examination. At approximately 4 p.m., Prosecutor Ouyang Shu arrived to examine the body and determined that the deceased, Chen Changlin, 14 years old, had been crushed to death before his death. It was also learned that the deceased was an apprentice at the Qianyi Glass Factory and that his father, Chen Liangwei, had six children and lived at No. 1 Jvde Lane, Taiyang Temple Road, where he made a living pulling a rickshaw. Also, at approximately 3 p.m. yesterday, at the corner of Datong Road (opposite the second team of the Pengpu Security Corps), a man resembling a beggar, approximately 30 years old, suddenly collapsed and died. He was wearing a blue cloth jacket and pants, had a shaved head, and wore white socks without shoes. The body was examined at the same time, and no family members were found. The guarantor was instructed to arrange for burial.

<h3 id="e174">The Case of Pan Wenxia Being Accused: Does the Film Company Have a Role to Play? <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Pan Wenxia, the lead actress in the Meihua Film Company's sound film "Song of the Rose," signed a contract with the company on August 1 of this year for a period of 12 months, with a stipulated monthly salary of 70 yuan. The contract also stipulated that after signing, Pan must be under the company's direction. Because Pan was born on the sixth day of the tenth lunar month of the third year of the Republic of China, although she is nominally 21 years old, she is actually not yet 20 years old. Therefore, her father, Pan Qiqing, also signed the contract as her legal representative. Recently, when Pan went to the Shanghai Film Company on the 28th of last month to shoot a fashion film, Meihua Company prevented her from doing so. As a result, Lawyer Tang Hao filed a complaint with the criminal division of the First Special District Court, accusing Pan of violating Article 366 of the Criminal Law for breach of trust. After a preliminary hearing, the case was adjourned because Pan's address was incorrect and she could not be summoned. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yuzhu opened the first criminal court for a summons. Pan did not appear again. Judge Liu announced that the bailiff had reported that when attempting to summon Pan, the person at 107 Lane 460, Aivanyi Road, stated that Pan had moved. Therefore, the summons was returned. Zhu Ruifeng was then summoned to the court. According to his testimony, the company's working hours were from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and the defendant went to the Shanghai Company to film without the company's permission on the 28th, which was indeed a breach of trust, etc. Zhou Yinong, the manager of the Yunrong Company, testified that on the 25th of last month, the company held a fashion show at the Vienna Ballroom and invited Pan Wenxia to participate. Zhu Ruifeng had approved this. At that time, the Shanghai Company was filming news footage on the spot, and Zhu also witnessed it. Later, because several shots needed to be reshot, Pan was invited to the Shanghai Company to reshoot on the 28th. Zhu was consulted beforehand, and Zhu said that as long as Pan agreed, there was no problem. Moreover, after this lawsuit, Pan continued to film at Meihua every day. According to rumors, this lawsuit actually had a purpose, etc. However, Zhu denied that there was any purpose and stated that he had never allowed her to film at the Shanghai Company, etc. Judge Liu then ordered the case to be adjourned for one week for further hearing. If Pan does not appear again, a warrant will be issued for her arrest. The court was then adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Attendees <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>

<h3 id="e178">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Zhengting said in his speech, briefly, that he was honored to have everyone participate in today's 14th membership solicitation meeting. He felt that there were many participants today, which could also show our cooperative efforts. Transportation is the most important work to help national construction, and road construction is especially important in transportation construction. Therefore, the National Road Construction Association was established to awaken the people of the country to the awareness of road construction. At the beginning of the establishment of the Road Construction Association, the national highway was only 1,000 kilometers. Until recently, the highway construction in various provinces has expanded to 97,000 kilometers, which shows the necessity of road construction and publicity. Secondly, how to continue to promote and maintain roads and protect roads is the most important cause and responsibility to be carried out in the second step. The function of building roads is not only convenient for bandit prevention and military affairs, but also has great economic benefits. For example, Jiangxi recently has made great progress in road construction, and the Red Bandits have therefore been unable to use their tactics. In short, as long as we have more comrades, things will be easier to develop and succeed, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Kong Xiangxi's Speech <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Prime Minister once resigned from the task of being the President and took over the task of being the National Railway Superintendent, which shows the importance that the late Prime Minister attached to road construction. When I was in Shanxi Province a few years ago, I deeply felt the inconvenience of transportation in Shanxi and the difficulties of the people's travel and the great economic losses. Therefore, I suggested to Chairman Yan Baichuan to build roads. Chairman Yan also felt the importance of road construction, so he began to order the armory to build roads to facilitate the people's travel. Later, when I arrived in Shanghai, I and Mr. Wang Rutang and others jointly organized the National Road Association to promote the road building movement. Now the national roads have gradually been built. What is needed now is how to maintain the roads and improve the roads. What is especially important is the source of cars and gasoline. Because if we have highways, but lack cars and gasoline, it is still not complete. Therefore, we should pay attention to how we build cars and supply our own car fuel to recover our rights. Therefore, in order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, on the one hand, we must actively let the general public know the importance of building roads, and at the same time, we must actively cultivate specialized talents to solve the fundamental problems of developing China's transportation. This is the whole meaning of promoting road construction, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Chu Minyi's Speech <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Chu Minyi, representative of President Wang, gave a speech saying that everyone knows that to revitalize national construction, transportation construction is a particularly important task. Therefore, I believe that to build China, we must start with building transportation. Therefore, the establishment and work of the China National Road Construction Association has great significance. Regarding the issue of transportation tools after the highway is built, I believe that when China cannot manufacture cars and does not have gasoline, promoting horse-drawn carriages is the only way to make up for it. Because in the inland countryside, horse-drawn carriages are indeed a more suitable means of transportation. However, promoting horse-drawn carriages is not regressing, because it is like we usually eat shark fin and sea cucumber. When necessary, we will eat some green vegetables and tofu. I hope everyone understands this point. Promoting horse-drawn carriages does have many advantages in China, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Liu Wendao's Speech <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Then, Liu Wendao, our country's ambassador to Italy, gave a speech, saying that he had three thoughts on this visit: (1) Roads are related to enriching the country in peacetime, (2) Roads are related to military affairs in wartime, and (3) Roads can nationalize the country and unify the country's culture. The development of cause must start with transportation. When I was in Germany, I saw that the country's causes were developed all near the Rhine, and I felt the importance of transportation. With the development of transportation, the number of cars will inevitably increase. Therefore, car factories will naturally produce in large quantities. Now, because of the progress of science, car machines are unified and simplified, and parts can be used in other industries. Therefore, the first conclusion is that although enriching the country does not rely on road construction, the development of road administration can help enrich the country. Second, after a country's national crisis, in addition to the renewal of railways, it also demarcated several provinces to build car roads, so that every three hours there can be a car passing through, winning our country with a certain time. Once something happens, we must seek to concentrate our military strength. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the army, we must first build roads. Therefore, the second conclusion is that although strengthening the army does not necessarily require road construction, there is no doubt that road construction can help strengthen the army. Third, I just returned from abroad, and I was so stimulated that I always remembered the national crisis. I often thought of the New Life Movement. The New Life Movement is to be orderly, to be proper and orderly, and to be clean and honest is to be orderly. Otherwise, there is no order. The roads in Berlin and Rome are very clean from morning to night, and the sidewalks on the left and right are orderly. In our country, it is a mess. This is the result of the lack of order and discipline in the hearts of the people. You can see from the small that the degree of civilization of a country can be seen from the way you walk. Maintaining a neat and solemn form in peacetime will cultivate a firm and unyielding will. The social people have a spirit of the rule of law, and then they can help each other and support the leaders, and go to the national crisis together under a leader. The chairman, the commander-in-chief, and others have worked hard to promote road construction for 14 years, which is of great relationship with the national revival. Because of the neat roads, the habit of observing discipline is cultivated, assisting the central government, and organizing a vigorous movement to avenge the shame. After that, Mr. Liu's speech was passionate and generous, and the audience was moved. Then Mr. Wang Zhengting gave a closing speech, and each person was given a copy of the Road Monthly, and they dispersed happily.</p>

<p>Wang Zuocai, 32 years old, a native of Songjiang, the manager of the Zhonghua Iron Factory at No. 30, Lujiabang Road, Nanshi, the factory employs more than 100 workers. Yesterday was the day when the factory paid the wages to the workers, so he withdrew 1,700 yuan of banknotes from the Bank of China. The wages were about to be distributed to the workers by name in the accounting room. At 3:30 p.m. yesterday, four robbers suddenly came. One of the robbers was wearing a black vest and a copper basin felt hat. The others were wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers. The robbers spoke the Jiangbei dialect and the local dialect. The robbers divided into one robber to guard the door and the rest broke into the factory, shouting and forbidding any noise, first cutting off the telephone line, and then supervising many partners in the factory in one place, and robbing all the 1,700 yuan of banknotes for paying wages in the accounting room, and also searching and robbing the clothes of the partners in the factory. The robbers gained the stolen goods and fled to the north.

<p>Qian Baiyan Denies Involvement in Manufacturing</p>
<p>Workers Testify That It Was Made into Medicated Water</p>
<p>Qian Baiyan, also known as Qian Mian, a native of Zhenjiang, 25 years old, who lives at No. 4, Yinyu Lane, Mai Gao Baolu Road, French Concession, opened a Xinsheng Hospital in the shop downstairs at No. 799-801, Aiduya Road. Recently, due to the economic downturn, the two or three floors of the building were vacant and no one rented them. Therefore, he and Zhang Sen, a Ningbo native who lived at No. 25, Hengye Lane, No. 1414, Aiduya Road, jointly invested in setting up an illegal morphine manufacturing organization in the Xinsheng Hospital, secretly manufacturing and selling it, and making a lot of profit. Unexpectedly, the matter was not secret. Recently, Guo Bole, the West Inspector of the French Police, found out and led Inspector Li Yaolong, Detective Zhang Daorong, Bao Detective Liu Jinrong, Shen Jinshu, and others to search the organization at 9 a.m. on the 5th of this month. They arrested the boss Qian Baiyan and seven other accomplices, including Lu Xianglong, Li Asan, Yang Xin, Zhang Jinfu, Zhu Huaming, and Zhang Ziwei. They seized a lot of machines and equipment and took them to the police station. However, the shareholder Zhang Sen had already heard the news and escaped without being caught. The police station had sent the defendants to the Second Special Court for trial and investigation. These details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu presided over the first criminal court for interrogation. The defendants were defended by Lawyers Wang Shizong and Tang Hao. First, Police Lawyer Gu Jixi stated the case and prosecuted according to Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. When interrogated, the defendant Qian Baiyan confessed that he had rented the house to Zhang Sen, who was at large, for a monthly rent of 120 yuan, and did not know that he was manufacturing morphine. Lu Xianglong confessed that he was a partner in the hospital, earning 20 yuan a month, and only knew that medicated water was being made upstairs, and did not know that it was morphine. Li Asan confessed that he was introduced by a friend to work as a handyman for Zhang Sen, earning 15 yuan a month, and was arrested after working for 14 days. Yang Xin confessed that he made medicated water in the organization and earned 12 yuan. Zhang Jinfu confessed that he was an old steward in the hospital and did not know what was being made upstairs. Zhu Huaming confessed that he was learning medicine from Qian Baiyan and knew that medicated water was being made upstairs. Zhang Ziwei confessed that medicated water was being made upstairs, with a total of four people. The two people in the case now are Lu and Li. The boss doesn't come often, etc. After verifying the confessions in court, he ordered the start of the debate.

<h3 id="e190">The Wuxian Medical Association Sent a Letter Requesting the Banning of American Doctor Lan Wen <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Health Bureau</p>
<p>American doctor Lan Wen recently came to Shanghai. After the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association exposed his so-called new method of treating tuberculosis as having no scientific basis, he secretly arrived in Suzhou and resumed various forms of promotion. The Municipal Health Bureau recently received a letter from the Wuxian Medical Association requesting measures to ban Lan Wen's activities in China. The original letter is transcribed below for public information: "We previously read in the newspaper that American doctor Lan Wen was practicing a secret method for treating lung disease in Shanghai. Your Bureau Chief and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Medical Association successively opposed it. Because the doctor had no foothold in Shanghai, he then came to Suzhou Bo Xi Hospital and continued to practice his secret treatment. On October 6th, he held an advertising-style promotion at the hospital. More than twenty members of our association attended the lecture, but gained no understanding whatsoever. We believe that Mr. Lan has not obtained a license to practice from the Ministry of Health of our country. He rashly came to Suzhou and used a secret method for treating tuberculosis that has no scientific basis, directly conducting human experiments and exaggerating his publicity to society. Our association believes that since he has neither published achievements nor has a scientifically honest attitude, he is insulting the Chinese people and despising the medical community. We feel deeply concerned and dare not fail to report this. In addition to submitting official letters to the Wuxian County Party Headquarters, the County Government, and the National Medical Association, which will be forwarded to the Ministry of Health of the Interior, we specially send this letter to your Bureau to explain the advantages and disadvantages, quickly ban him, protect the lives of the people, and maintain national dignity. This would be in the public interest."</p>

<h3 id="e194">Another Drug Manufacturing Facility Discovered Due to a Fire on Dagu Road <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>A Coal Store Located Downstairs, the Factory on the Top Floor</p>
<p>Workers Fled Quietly Upon Seeing the Fire</p>
<p>丨Large Quantities of Raw Materials for Drug Manufacturing Seized丨</p>
<p>Although there are many private drug manufacturing facilities in the city, it is difficult to crack down on them because the people involved maintain strict secrecy. However, their evil deeds have reached a climax, and they have recently been plagued by repeated fires, leading to their gradual self-destruction. After Cai Bicheng's factory on Avenu Edward VII was burned down, the factory on Wuding Road was also destroyed by fire a week later. Before these two cases could be concluded, the drug manufacturing facility at 124 Dagu Road continued the trend and went up in flames. As a result, the details of the situation were exposed. The building is leased from Dehe Foreign Company for 105 yuan per month. The drug manufacturing workshop was located on the top floor. To hide it from the public, a Tianchang Coal Store was opened downstairs. At around 3 PM the day before yesterday, a fire broke out in the workshop due to carelessness during drug refining. The workers, realizing that a disaster had occurred but not daring to report it, quietly fled. The Chinese constable stationed at post number 2194 discovered the fire and immediately reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station via telephone. Detective Yang Xinzheng and Western Detective Kena Tai rushed to the scene. After the fire brigade extinguished the fire, they entered the building to investigate. They found only coal balls worth about 100 yuan in the coal store downstairs. The third floor was a pure drug manufacturing workshop, with all the equipment, furnishings, and various instruments for making drugs, similar to Cai Bicheng's factory. Since everyone in the building had fled, it was impossible to investigate who the owner of the factory was. However, there is speculation that the factory was also established by Cai. However, this cannot be confirmed at present. In addition to the arrangement of equipment and other items, the third floor also had a steam room, a sand-drying room, and the fire originated in the pavilion room. At the time, Chinese and Western detectives seized two bags of preliminary processed yellow heroin, ten small bottles of ether, six small bottles of acid, one box of soda, one foot-operated respirator, five molds, two earthenware vats filled with yellow liquid, one iron bucket of white powder, two chimneys, and other scattered instruments such as glass bottles. They compiled a list and also found two notes with the addresses 16 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road, and 26 Yunle Village, Avenue Edward VII. The detectives went to investigate these two locations, but found no clues. They reported back to the detective chief, who ordered the drugs to be sent to the Public Works Department for testing and notified all police stations to arrest the drug manufacturers. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin took the list of drugs and petitioned the First Special District Court to dispose of the items. After Judge Liu Yugui questioned the circumstances of the case, he ordered that the equipment and raw materials specifically used for manufacturing opium substitutes be confiscated, the coal balls be auctioned, and the proceeds be sent to the court for safekeeping.</p>

<p>Lantern Parade: In addition to inviting well-known figures from the academic community to give lectures and manufacturers to distribute exquisite national products, the Pudong National Products Exhibition also held a lantern parade yesterday. Sixty manufacturers participated, each preparing unique lanterns and music bands. Approximately three thousand people participated in the lantern parade. They proceeded from Zhenxiu Road to Yangjiadu Avenue, went north to Lujiadu, entered Lanni Du Avenue, passed Lujiazhai to the Tianzhang Paper Factory, went south to Pudong District Avenue, and went west into Dongchang Road Bingchang Tian to disperse the team. Tens of thousands of women, children, and elderly people watched along the way.

<p>Lin Zongqiao Violated All Moral Principles</p>
<p>Lin Yunlai, 51 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 87 Guangqi Road in the city, worked as a clerk in a timber company. His son, Lin Zongqiao, 26 years old, did not engage in proper work and associated with gangsters. The father repeatedly admonished him, but he did not repent. He often demanded money from his father, and when he did not get it, he would violently beat his father, causing injuries. He was once detained and sent to the police station, but the magistrate dismissed the case as a minor family matter and released him. Unexpectedly, the undutiful son Lin Zongqiao intensified his behavior. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, he again demanded money from his father. When he did not get it, he actually killed his father with a knife, causing injuries. Patrolman Wang Rugang arrived and arrested the undutiful son, sending him to the Yimiao Police Station for investigation. Officer Yang interrogated the defendant, who admitted to repeatedly beating his father. He has now committed a murderous act with a knife, violating all moral principles and being extremely heinous. He has been admonished before but did not obey. The father, Lin Yunlai, requested that the undutiful son be severely punished to protect his own life. The request was granted, and he was sent to the bureau for severe punishment to uphold moral principles and rectify the deteriorating social atmosphere.</p>

Yesterday, Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the first criminal court and sentenced Wang Diansheng to three months of imprisonment for obstructing public officials from performing their duties. Zhao Muhai, Ren Youfeng, and Xu A'gen were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment for openly gathering a crowd to use violence and coercion against public officials performing their duties. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized was counted as two days to offset one day of imprisonment. The other parts of the lawsuit were acquitted. The ancillary civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court of this court for trial.</p>

<p>For the purpose of manufacturing insecticides and aiding rural areas, the China Chemical Industry Society of this city has been vigorously promoting the planting of pyrethrum chrysanthemums. Every autumn, the pyrethrum experimental field attached to it harvests seeds, which are distributed to comrades in all sectors for purchase and planting.

It has been learned that this year's chrysanthemum seedlings from the company have gradually germinated and the plants are strong and healthy. Pre-orders for distribution are being accepted starting today, and the pre-order price is calculated at 20% off. For each mu planted (i.e., 2,500 chrysanthemum seedlings are pre-ordered), the price is four yuan. More will be calculated accordingly. Half of the payment is collected in advance when pre-ordering, and customers can go to collect the seedlings according to the date indicated on the company's receipt. However, because chrysanthemums can withstand drought, they must be taken care of during transportation, so they must be collected in person. It is also reported that the company has a set of pre-order chrysanthemum seedling methods, and recent pre-orders have been extremely enthusiastic. If you are near Tangqi, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, you can contact Mr. Yang Tongsheng at No. 35, Shuibei, Tangqi, the company's cooperative farm, to purchase them.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs, I recently read the news column of your newspaper on the 19th, which contained the "Cao Zhenhai Arson Sentence" news, which said, "Cao Zhenhai rented a Linhua Yanzhi Store at No. 603, Ronghuali, Malang Road, from Ningbo native Lin Rongbao in February last year. The business was still quite developed. In February this year, Lin Rongbao and his partners Wang Guanglan and apprentice Jiang Ruixing were dug away. They jointly invested with Wang Guanglian, a native of Zhenjiang, at the entrance of Laohuali, which is connected to Cao's store, to open a Ronghua store," etc. After checking, the house at No. 603 Malang Road was ordered by me, and the Linhua store was also created by me. Last year, I changed to another industry and had no intention of operating it, so I rented it to Cao Zhenhai for business. As for the Ronghua store at No. 605, it was created by Wang Guanglian's sole investment, and the house was leased directly from Yihe Company, which has nothing to do with me. Moreover, the name Wang Guanglan mentioned in your newspaper cannot be found at all. The contents of your newspaper are thought to be mistaken by hearsay. Please correct it in particular to clarify the truth. I am grateful to the editor of Shenbao for his peace. Lin Yongbao respectfully, October 20th,</p>
<p>Dear Editor, Yesterday your newspaper published a news item "Dazhonghua Rubber Factory Resumes Work Well Yesterday," which said that labor and capital have now agreed on conditions, etc., which is not true. After investigation, the workers went to resume work yesterday, and obtained the permission of our association in advance. As for the words signed by the factory's coercion, it is close to the nature of employment and is unethical. How can the labor-capital conditions be confused?

<h3 id="e221">Kidnappers Send Letters Extorting Huge Sums of Money, Small Hostages Found in Apartments <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Kidnapping Case in Huajie Solved in French Concession</p>
<p>Five Male and Female Kidnappers Arrested in Succession</p>
<p>Yu Sanfu, a Mi Po native, is 40 years old. His wife, Ms. Zhang, is the same age as Yu and lives at No. 50, Hongchenfang, Oujia Road, under the jurisdiction of the Public Security Bureau of the Fifth District of Zhabei. They have a son named Changgeng, who is four years old this year. Yu runs a coppersmith's workshop and his business is quite developed, and he has assets, which has aroused the envy of bandits. At about 3:00 pm on the 2nd of this month, Yu's son, Changgeng, was led by a wet nurse to play at the entrance of the alley. Suddenly, several kidnappers came and kidnapped the child Yu Changgeng. At that time, Yu reported to the police agencies in the Chinese Concession, requesting investigation. After three or four days, Yu received a letter from the bandits, extorting a ransom of 50,000 yuan. Because the negotiations were not settled, the child is still not out of danger. Until 10:00 am yesterday, the special agency of the French Concession Detective Superintendent Jin Jiulin learned that a gang of kidnappers was hiding in Room 18, Central Apartment, No. 40, Daodeli, Beile Road, in the French Concession, waiting for the person in charge to send someone to negotiate. Superintendent Jin then led Detectives Zhang Ziying, Qin Youyu, Wang Ronggui, Bao Tan Tian Shiqing, Jin Bingwen, Tao Ronglin, Xu Guilin, etc., and went to Room 18 of the Central Apartment without making a sound, and arrested two kidnappers, Hua Zhongbiao from Shaoxing (43 years old) and Qian Jintu (32 years old). They confessed that the location of the hidden ticket agency was in the pavilion on the second floor of No. 5, Hongshoufang, Busa Boma White Road, in the British Concession. The detectives immediately met with the Chinese and foreign detectives sent by the Public Concession to go there, and rescued the small hostage Yu Changgeng, and arrested the male and female bandits watching the ticket, Zhang Taixing (38 years old), Zhang Zufat (31 years old), and Zhang Shangshi (19 years old, Zufat's wife) from Shaoxing. Then, at Room 432, Dashanghai Hotel, No. 423, Tianjin Road, they continued to capture three bandits, Zhuang Qian (28 years old), Wang Zhencheng (38 years old), and Huang Youmei (all three from Shaoxing), and the detectives took them back to the French Concession together, and notified the person in charge, and first took the hostage back. The bandits were ordered to be detained separately by the Western Detectives, pending interrogation. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau was also informed that the hostage's residence and the kidnapping location were in Zhabei in Huajie, so the Detective Team sent detectives to the French Concession to request the extradition of the bandits to be interrogated.</p>

<h3 id="e222">The Compilation of the Twenty-Five Histories: The Twenty-Four Histories and the New History of Yuan <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Yutong</p>
<p>Before an ideal general history appears, the Twenty-Four Histories have their own value of existence. The Twenty-Four Histories are so vast in scope, and the organization is certainly not perfect, but there is no way, if we want to know a little more about history, we always have to consult them. We cannot use our current perspective to blame the people who compiled history in the past, saying that they only knew how to stick to the methods of Sima Qian and Ban Gu, and compile dynastic histories like drawing a gourd, because in a feudal society, only such histories are suitable products.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Twenty-Four Histories have indeed become a complete system, not a meaningless compilation. Although it is in the biographical style, most of them have "Zhi" and "Biao," etc. The parts missing from each history have been supplemented and revised by scholars of past dynasties, and they are almost complete. Taking the Twenty-Four Histories as the backbone and adding the supplements is a very rich cultural history. Furthermore, there are overlapping parts in the Twenty-Four Histories, the most obvious of which are the History of the Five Dynasties and the New History of the Five Dynasties, the History of Tang and the New History of Tang. This repetition is not just to boast of abundance. Generally, the new intention lies in correction, and with the new, abandoning the old will also lose the benefit of reference and mutual evidence, so concurrent collection and juxtaposition have their own meaning.</p>
<p>The compilation of the History of Yuan in the Ming Dynasty was very sloppy. The people who participated in it at that time did not know Mongolian, and they did not know much about the institutions and culture of the Yuan Dynasty. They just copied it randomly, which led to many errors. General criticism says that the History of Yuan is the most desolate among the histories, which aroused the motivation of a group of scholars to study or transform the History of Yuan. Those who studied the History of Yuan include Qian Daxin, Li Wentian, Hong Jun, Ding Qian, Zhang Xiangwen, etc. Their works have revised the History of Yuan, but only in part. Those who intended to transform the History of Yuan include Shao Yuanping, Wei Yuan, Tu Ji, etc. Tu Ji's History of the Mongols was published, but it was not completed. Shao Yuanping's Yuan History Compilation and Wei Yuan's New History of Yuan are just "chronicle" work, at most equivalent to Wang Hongxu's Draft History of Ming. Ke Shaomin's New History of Yuan was completed last. This book is meticulously sourced and rigorously established, which is the opposite of the hasty completion of the History of Yuan. Although Chen Yuan criticized that it is better to annotate and supplement the History of Yuan than to transform it, like Pei Songzhi's annotation of the Records of the Three Kingdoms and Chu Shaosun's supplement to the Records of the Historian, this is actually the meaning of "blaming the worthy." Compared with the New History of the Five Dynasties and the New History of Tang, this book is more than just "no shame." Kaiming Bookstore includes it in the system of the Twenty-Four Histories and combines it into the Twenty-Five Histories, which can be said to be undoubtedly appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Twenty-Five Histories and National Rejuvenation <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Zhizhan</p>
<p>Those who do not read the history of their own country cannot spontaneously generate patriotism, and those who do not understand the past of the development of their own nation cannot be expected to shoulder the responsibility of rejuvenating the nation. It is a pity that our country's historical records are too numerous to be counted, and scholars often suffer from the difficulty of purchasing and reviewing them. Now, Kaiming Bookstore has seen the need and reprinted the Twenty-Five Histories, reduced into nine volumes, and charged a low price, which is really immeasurable in helping the exploration and research of national history. It is hoped that schools, societies, and families will each have one copy, so that whether it is young students or social elders, or even housewives, can seek the process of the development of our Chinese nation in this, and even if they do not want to spontaneously generate a patriotic heart, they will not be able to. Therefore, Kaiming's reprinting of the Twenty-Five Histories is not only a blessing to the education sector, but also a small supplement to the future of the country and the nation. Reading its publication origin, I am happy to write this to promote it.</p>
<h3 id="e224">On the New History of Yuan and New Compilation of History of Yuan <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Simian</p>
<p>Your letter suspects which of the books of Wei and Ke is applicable, and this is not doubtful. The official history is no longer entirely for the reading of ordinary people today, but specifically for the use of experts to extract materials. Those for ordinary people to read are troubled by its complexity, and those for experts to extract materials seek its completeness. Since the Tang Dynasty, the two have been impossible to combine. In ancient times, there were few historical materials, and historians' views were also rough, and the relationship between things was taken and discarded at will. Therefore, the resulting books cannot be very complex. After a dynasty is founded, the history of the previous dynasty can be read by ordinary people. The situation in later generations is different, and historical materials are always suffering from being too many. It is unbearable to abandon them during compilation, and it is too complicated to store them all. Those who discuss historical selection argue over the complexity and simplicity, and there is no plan, which is due to this (those who discuss may not know it themselves, but it is actually forced by this situation). At this time, books that preserve materials and books that are for ordinary people to read should be separated into two things. However, this principle did not become clear until Zhang Shizhai came out. Before this, historians mostly wandered between the two, which is why it was so difficult for them to write. However, rather than abandoning it, it is better to save it, everyone has this idea, which is why the official history is not expected to be complex and is becoming more and more complex. Then, the reason why later experts in history can draw on it is that they are given this gradual complexity. The strength of Ke's book lies in its completeness. The rewriting of the History of Yuan has been done for a long time. There are also many people who have revised and supplemented it. The books used are more or less, and the theories are right or wrong. To study this history today, one is not only troubled by the desolation of the old history, but also by the fact that there are too many materials outside the history that are not easy to collect, and there are many conflicting theories outside the history that are difficult to choose. Ke's book is diligent in collecting and cautious in compromising. With this, what the old history has left out and what later generations have revised and supplemented are all included in the two hundred and dozens of volumes, which is why it seems complex but is actually simple. Although Wei's book has a new style, it is too simple in its content. Moreover, they are all old theories from a hundred years ago. Not only have they not borrowed from Western history since Hong Wenqing, but also the historical materials stored in the country are not fully collected. Abandoning Ke's book and reading Wei's book, how can the other books not be covered? Then seeking simplicity becomes complexity. I was able to read Ke's book when it was first published, and I borrowed it from my predecessor, Mr. Tu Jingshan. After browsing through it, the teacher asked me: "What do you think?" I did not dare to answer and asked the teacher instead. The teacher said: "The strength of this book lies in its extensive collection, which can save those who study this history a lot of energy." I was very happy that his views were the same. The teacher also asked: "Since Ke's book has been ordered by the government and listed in the school officials, then among the official histories, Tang, Five Dynasties, and Yuan, there are two parallel lists. The students' daily efforts may be difficult to supply. If there is something to be established, can something be replaced?" I replied: "There are actually more overlapping official histories than this number. The differences and similarities between the Records of the Historian and the History of Han are mostly in wording, as are the books of Qi, Liang, Chen, Wei, Northern Qi, Zhou, and Sui in the History of the North and South. Moreover, there are those who originally had this defect and supplemented it with that one. But if there is a good collator who bases it on one and notes the differences and similarities of the other below, then one can be saved. There are too many differences and similarities between the New and Old Tang and Five Dynasties, even those that are the same are very different in wording, so they should be kept together. If the Old History of Yuan, then what it has is almost nothing beyond the New History. If you get its new, the old can almost be abandoned." The teacher also thought it was right. This matter has been more than ten years, and the teacher has also returned to the mountains for a long time, so I describe it sadly.</p>
<h3 id="e225">The Inspiration for a Comprehensive History of China <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Xin’gang</p>
<p>The Twenty-Four Histories are difficult to acquire, even with modest means. The lithographic edition from the Tongwen Publishing House is much cheaper than the palace edition, yet still costs over two hundred yuan. Now, the Commercial Press is collecting and printing ancient editions, but even with pre-orders, it costs three hundred yuan. Those who can read often lack the means to buy, while those with the means often buy them for display. The mismatch between need and supply seems like an inherent flaw, causing one to sigh in contemplation. Now, the Kaiming Bookstore is using zinc plates to print the Twenty-Five Histories, with small but clear characters, and includes reference bibliographies and name indexes. The number of volumes is increased, making searching more convenient, while the price is reduced even further, benefiting scholars immensely. If they could build upon this ambition and expand it, from the Book of Documents and Zuo Zhuan to the Donghua Records and Draft History of Qing, further breaking down the traditional concept of "official history," categorizing works like the Sixteen Kingdoms Spring and Autumn Annals and the Ten Kingdoms Spring and Autumn Annals (historically called "unofficial histories") as "supplementary histories," and works like the Khitan National History and Great Jin National History as "separate histories," and compiling chronicles and essential records into one collection called "One Hundred Histories of China," their contribution to the academic world would be tenfold greater. In recent years, spurred by the times, the Chinese people are thinking about establishing a foundation for nationalism, and are eager to find a comprehensive history of China to read, but are hampered by the lack of such a book. This is due to a lack of individual talent and the inability to centralize materials. The Kaiming Bookstore colleagues are determined to promote culture, and it is hoped that they will seize this opportunity, take the lead, and work hard to collect historical books and compile indexes. As for analyzing materials, categorizing them, and verifying differences to achieve uniformity, this is our responsibility. In ten years, this will surely satisfy the nation's expectations.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Gu expects us to take on the responsibility of broadly collecting historical materials and expanding from the "Twenty-Five Histories" to create a comprehensive "One Hundred Histories of China," which is a great honor! We are certainly happy to accept Mr. Gu's expectations. However, regarding broadly collecting historical materials and starting with the compilation and printing of the "Twenty-Five Histories," there are doubts and inquiries from outside, which need to be clarified. Our country has a vast amount of literature, and almost all books, in a broad sense, are historical materials. Even within the four categories of books, the history section alone has numerous classifications, too many to list. If we were to edit this vast historical literature, we could not do so without standards or haphazardly. However, everyone has their own subjective views, making it difficult to determine the standards. Before a standard is agreed upon, the official "standard histories" of the past can serve as temporary standards. If "standard histories" serve as temporary standards, then our preliminary work today is only to compile and print the "Twenty-Five Histories." If we were to print only the Twenty-Four Histories now and omit the "New History of Yuan," we would not only violate the temporary standard, but also feel outdated. If we do not attend to Mr. Gu's instructions for meaningful and systematic classification and broad compilation, then even two hundred and fifty histories or two hundred and sixty histories can be haphazardly gathered, but what would that achieve? Therefore, strictly speaking, the initial collection for compiling and printing historical books today should only consist of the "Twenty-Five Histories," and the number should not be arbitrarily reduced or expanded. Any expansion must be done in a meaningful and systematic way as instructed by Mr. Gu. This note is specially appended to express Mr. Gu's great kindness and to explain our work to those who care about it.</p>
<h3 id="e226">A New Path for Publishing Important Books <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Qifeng</p>
<p>The Kaiming Bookstore is taking the palace edition of the Twenty-Four Histories and combining it with Ke Shaomin's New History of Yuan, published by the Tuigengtang Publishing House, to create the Twenty-Five Histories, reducing them using zinc plates, and publishing them for the world. They asked me to say a few words as an introduction. The name "official history" originated in the History of the Sui Dynasty. The Song Dynasty designated Seventeen Histories, and subsequent additions led to the Qing Dynasty combining the Old Book of Tang and the Old History of the Five Dynasties into the Twenty-Four Histories. Since the Book of the Later Han, they have all followed the model of Ban Gu and Ban Zhao, with successive dynasties continuing the work, differing from the divergent and branching unofficial histories. There are many historical works, and without distinguishing them, they would become limitless. Therefore, the compilation of the Twenty-Four Histories, although originating from the so-called "imperial decree," has been undisputed by scholars to this day. The History of Yuan compiled during the Ming Dynasty had significant omissions. Ke Shaomin's New History of Yuan corrects errors and fills gaps, making significant contributions. Following the precedent of the New Book of Tang and the New History of the Five Dynasties, it is included in the official history, which can be said to be a proper and justified action. Before this, the official histories of previous dynasties were not complete without the Twenty-Four Histories, and now they cannot encompass the entirety of official history without the Twenty-Five Histories. Therefore, the name Twenty-Five Histories can be displayed proudly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the method of movable type printing has become popular, the publication of books has increased and accelerated. However, due to publishers seeking profit, they only aim for quick results, disregarding errors and omissions. I once exchanged several silver dollars for various typeset notebooks, and their value was only one-tenth of the price. Compared to fine woodblock-printed editions, they were less than one-hundredth as valuable. However, upon reading, numerous errors were found, making them unreadable. This made me think that if unscrupulous people were to hastily typeset and print important books from various categories and lower their prices to attract customers, then the disaster that befell the pear wood blocks in the past would now spread to the scholarly community. It is important to know that inaccurate proofreading of books can lead to errors that are insignificant at first but become serious mistakes later on. Lu Fangweng said that erroneous books scattered throughout the world mislead scholars even more, and it would be better not to publish them at all, expressing his deep concern. Every time I hear about the Commercial Press and the Zhonghua Book Company using photolithography to reprint old books, I rejoice and praise them. Fine editions are hard to come by, and proofreading is difficult. Now, with the help of cameras, the labor of typesetting and proofreading is saved, and there are no errors. It is truly a single action that achieves multiple benefits. The Kaiming Bookstore uses zinc plate reduction printing for the Twenty-Five Histories. Although the font is slightly smaller, it is clearer than lithographic printing. I once read the sample, and even with my old and blurry eyes, I could still recognize each character. The volume is smaller, and the price is lower. If they continue to take the essential books from the Siku Quanshu and make plates for reduction printing, then aspiring scholars, even if they are not from famous and wealthy families, can have ten thousand volumes at home. Wouldn't that be wonderful?</p>
<h3 id="e227">The Most Complete Collection of Standard Histories <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Shilu</p>
<p>The Kaiming edition of the Twenty-Five Histories is the newest and most complete collection of standard histories of past dynasties in our country. This book encompasses the main traces of various activities of the Chinese nation in the past. In the reading community, it is like cloth, beans, and millet, an indispensable classic, which needs no further discussion. What should be discussed is the current general attitude of the reading community towards classics. I fear they no longer have the leisurely time to read through the entire book, volume by volume, line by line, sentence by sentence, word by word. They only place it on their desks for occasional browsing and checking. Therefore, the classics published now must be comprehensive and also convenient for readers to carry, browse, and check. The Kaiming edition of the Twenty-Five Histories adds the New History of Yuan to the palace edition of the Twenty-Four Histories. The History of Ming also includes textual research. The end of the book also includes a name index, and each history also includes a list of references. In addition to convenient browsing, it can also inspire the minds of readers and researchers. It is comprehensive, and the space occupied by the entire book is minimal. Although the volume is small, the font is still very clear. Although the casting work is huge, the price is still very low. It strives to meet the needs of the general reading community today. I believe that this book is not only a treasure for historians but also a tool for promoting the culture of our nation. May the people of our country appreciate it!</p>
<h3 id="e228">Modern Printing Technology <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>丨Photographic Zinc Plate Printing of the Twenty-Five Histories丨</p>
<p>Most people only know that there are two types of new printing methods: "letterpress printing" and "lithographic printing." This is not surprising because most popular books and newspapers are printed using these two methods. Even the storefronts of printing shops often display signs that say "Letterpress and Lithographic Printing." However, in more specialized terms, modern printing techniques should be divided into three types: first, relief printing; second, intaglio printing; and third, planographic printing. Relief printing uses the raised surface of the plate for printing. Traditional Chinese woodblock printing and modern letterpress printing both belong to this category. In contrast, intaglio printing uses the recessed surface, and the most common examples are banknotes and stamps. As for lithographic printing, it uses chemical reactions to display the text and images on a special lithographic stone. During printing, only the necessary parts can receive ink and be printed on paper, while the other parts are made ink-resistant. The plate is completely flat, with no raised or recessed areas, which is completely different from the previous two types, so it belongs to planographic printing. Among these three types of printing, intaglio printing is not commonly used for printing books because the plate making and printing are very troublesome, and it is only suitable for printing fine items. Therefore, the common printing of books only uses relief and planographic printing.</p>
<p>However, relief printing is not limited to letterpress printing, and planographic printing is not limited to lithographic printing. Similar to lithographic printing, there are metal plates—zinc plates, aluminum plates (commonly known as lead skin plates), and offset plates (commonly known as rubber plates). In addition to letterpress printing, relief printing also includes photographic zinc plates, photographic halftone copper plates, and electroplated copper plates. The current Kaiming edition of the Twenty-Five Histories is printed using photographic zinc plates. This printing method is exactly the same as letterpress printing on the printing press. In other words, it uses the same letterpress printing machine, not a lithographic printing machine. However, letterpress printing combines individual movable types after proofreading, while zinc plate printing uses photographic methods to create a negative image of the original manuscript, which is transferred to a zinc plate coated with a photosensitive agent. Light is used to make the zinc plate display text that is the opposite of the original manuscript. Then, the photosensitive agent in the non-photosensitive areas is washed away, leaving only the photosensitive areas. Special chemicals are then used to make these areas acid-resistant, and finally, an acidic agent is used to corrode the other areas, leaving only the acid-resistant areas. The zinc plate produced in this way is almost the same as a letterpress plate composed of movable types, except that the zinc plate is a bit harder than the letterpress plate.</p>
<p>Since it is also relief printing, why not use letterpress printing but use photographic zinc plate printing for the Twenty-Five Histories? This question can be answered in a simple sentence: For a large book with four or five million words, it is impossible to proofread it without errors in a short period of time and with a small number of people. Only a precise camera can be used as a copying writer to reproduce it on the zinc plate. It can be responsible for being absolutely error-free, although the salary of this copying writer may be higher than that of the "humble people" and proofreaders combined.</p>
<p>However, planographic printing can also use photography. Why abandon planographic printing and use relief printing? It is true that photographic lithography is used a lot in popular books on the market, and even metal plates or rubber plates are often used to reproduce ancient books from the Song and Yuan dynasties. But if you compare a letterpress-printed book with a lithographic-printed book, you can see the differences. If you have ever seen fine-print lithographic books such as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin printed on glossy paper, you must have felt disgusted by the blurry fonts and floating ink. Of course, inferior letterpress-printed books often have the problem of being like a layer of clouds due to the corrosion of the lead types and the impurity of the ink, but they still feel more real than those lithographic-printed books. This is because lithographic printing uses a planographic plate, and the inked and non-inked parts on the planographic plate are at the same level. Although machine pressure is applied during printing, the paper is not as likely to be closely attached to the plate surface as in relief printing, especially with relatively rough or hard paper. Moreover, in planographic printing, the entire plate surface is rolled over by the ink roller. Although the non-inked parts are wiped with water, there are always some residual areas. The fine black dots in lithographic-printed books are due to this reason. As for photographic stone printing, the stone surface often cannot be as clear as the photograph, so it must be manually retouched. Sometimes, due to unclear fonts, workers make mistakes when writing from memory, which is also common. These common problems in lithographic printing can be reduced a lot in the more advanced lead skin plates or rubber plates, but they are not as good as photographic zinc plates printed using relief printing. Especially since the Twenty-Five Histories uses relatively rough newsprint to reduce costs, and the fonts are relatively small, planographic printing is not as clear as relief printing, which is the biggest reason for using relief printing.</p>
<p>Printing is an industrial technology, and most readers may not pay much attention to these relatively specialized trivial matters. However, publishers should carefully consider them. This is just to express our considerations so that everyone can understand.</p>

<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui once said that the Twenty-Four Histories, Thirteen Classics with Commentaries and Subcommentaries, Imperial Qing Dynasty Interpretations of the Classics, Nine Compendia, Record of the Government Bureau, Taiping Imperial Reader, and Complete Tang Prose, etc., from the Osaka edition are all essential for wealthy collectors. However, poor scholars have neither the means to purchase them nor the space to store them, which is a great regret. If they could be reduced to extremely small volumes, it would be very convenient for poor scholars. Now, the Twenty-Five Histories published by the Kaiming Bookstore greatly reduce the size and have extremely low prices, which fits Mr. Wu's words perfectly, benefiting poor scholars in no small way. I am very happy and write this inscription. If all the books mentioned by Mr. Wu could be printed in this way, the contribution would be even greater. This is what I hope the gentlemen of Kaiming will continue to work towards. Ding Fubao</p>
<p>Reading history can inspire patriotism. All the good words and deeds of our ancestors, and the regulations and cultural artifacts of the past, are recorded in historical books. The ancients have passed, and we inherit from them. How should we improve our conduct and make contributions to avoid feeling ashamed of our responsibilities? This is the feeling that must arise after reading history. Historical books are very numerous, and the Twenty-Four Histories are called standard histories. Standard histories are the standard. Ke's book was recently published and is a companion to the standard histories. Combining them into twenty-five is appropriate. If scholars can take the Twenty-Five Histories and recite them from time to time, the benefits they receive will not be limited to the individual. Jiang Yuan</p>
<p>Where to start reading a Twenty-Five History? This is a bit of a question. Books are never meant to be read from beginning to end. Reading from beginning to end makes no sense. The Twenty-Five Histories are just like a treasure trove. Read it in your free time, flip through it when you're busy, and put it there. The Kaiming Twenty-Five History is packed into nine volumes, which is convenient to carry and has the meaning of a towel box battleship.</p>
<p>This seems to be a passage of plucking the strings that does not know what tune to tune, but in fact, a good book is good, and it must be able to be bought, put down, and checked at any time. The best thing about the Kaiming version is that it has an index, and you can find it with a check. I have long wanted to compile a collection of biographies from various histories into a book of Chinese celebrity biographies. Now that there is this index, buying one is equivalent to having the most complete biographical dictionary. Lin</p>
<p>As the saying goes, where do you start with a Twenty-Four History? It can be seen that reading history is really not easy. Now, the Kaiming edition of the "Twenty-Five Histories" only has nine volumes, which has achieved unprecedented success in terms of economy and convenience. From now on, the Twenty-Four Histories can be discussed and discussed in a big way. Yu Pingbo</p>
<p>Historical books are numerous, and in this day and age, it is difficult to read them all. When occasionally flipping through them, one must spread the books all over the desk, and it takes a long time to find what is needed. Now, the Kaiming Bookstore has added the New History of Yuan to the Twenty-Four Histories, collectively called the Twenty-Five Histories. And it has been re-packaged, and such a huge work is only nine volumes. How can the convenience to scholars be limited!</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the Twenty-Five Histories is a must-have reference book. The general public criticizes the Twenty-Five Histories as being heroic. But heroism also has its time, but it has already passed. We can read the heroic Twenty-Five Histories from a non-heroic standpoint, and find the social forms of the time from the biographies of individuals—this is not only a possible method, but the only method. In particular, the "military affairs", "criminal law", and "food and goods" in the Twenty-Five Histories are of great significance to the times.</p>
<p>The publishing technology of Kaiming Bookstore is praised by everyone. It is not only able to make full use of modern printing technology, but also able to make full use of modern editing technology. Its greatest contribution is to make this must-have book a book that the general public can afford. What is collected is the recognized "good edition", and two appendices with supreme reference value are added. The reduced version adds convenience to collection and carrying without losing the convenience of reference—reference books do not need large versions. Photography and casting can avoid typos. Zhang Nai</p>
<p>I think that the old-fashioned Twenty-Four Histories can be bought with money, but there is no place to put them, especially inconvenient to carry. I welcome the reprint of the Twenty-Five Histories from the Kaiming Bookstore, which is convenient to put and carry, and relatively effortless to buy. Chen Wangdao</p>
<p>I often say that publishers should find ways to help friends in the pavilion room. If all the books were printed like the Twenty-Five Histories, half of the Siku Quanshu would be hidden in the pavilion room. So when the Kaiming Bookstore publishes the Twenty-Five Histories, I want to shout "Bravo" first. Fu</p>
<p>I have researched from school exam results and found that young people today are very ignorant of history. This phenomenon is deeply worrying. Being ignorant of history means being ignorant of the culture of the past, and there is no way to find out where the spirit of our Chinese nation lies. As a Chinese person today, it is not difficult. I would like to call on young people to pay attention and learn more about historical books in the future. Not only to learn, but also to see the spirit of our Chinese nation from it, and then carry it forward, so as not to be ashamed of being a Chinese person today. The Kaiming Bookstore prints the Twenty-Five Histories, imitating the form of foreign popular editions, which is very convenient for young people. I am grateful for the need to learn about historical books and happy to introduce this book to the young people of today. Liu Zhanen</p>
<p>I have long wanted to get a Twenty-Four History to put on my desk. Now that Kaiming has published the Twenty-Five Histories, it has realized my dream and also solved the problem of how travelers can carry this encyclopedia of broken generations. Zheng Zhenduo</p>

<h3 id="e232">Ministry of Education Orders That Salaries of Military Instructors in High Schools Be Paid as Usual <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th) The Ministry of Education compiled a book of education laws and regulations from March of last year to June of the third year and issued a notice to all departments and bureaus on the 20th. The Ministry of Education approved a report from the General Directorate of Training, stating that when schools end the military training for second-year students according to the transitional measures, the treatment of military instructors should remain at the original level. It has now issued a notice to all departments and bureaus stating that military instructors in schools should be full-time in principle, and the treatment of military instructors has been revised. Article 6 of the military education plan for high schools and above clearly stipulates that after the military training for second-year students in senior high schools and equivalent schools is completed, the number of hours taught by military instructors will inevitably decrease. The schools should still maintain the original amount of salary paid to the military instructors according to the plan and should not reduce it on the pretext of decreasing hours taught. The order is hereby issued for compliance.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Interior believes that medical education is related to people's lives, and not only emphasizes the exploration of academic theory, but also emphasizes experience and practice.

It has specially requested the Ministry of Education to instruct the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to strictly prohibit correspondence courses in medicine. After approving the report, the Ministry of Education will issue a notice to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to investigate and prohibit them separately.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Opening of the City's Elementary School Holiday Homework Exhibition Yesterday <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Director Pan Presided and Delivered a Speech on Behalf of the Mayor</p>
<p>25,000 Exhibits Displayed in 14 Rooms</p>
<p>The Exhibition Continues This Morning and Closes at Noon</p>
<p>Exhibits from Each School Must Be Retrieved from 1 PM</p>
<p>The first city-wide elementary school holiday homework exhibition, organized by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education and the Children's Morning Post, opened at 9:00 AM yesterday at Wanzhu Elementary School. The exhibition continues this morning for half a day, and exhibits will be collected by each school from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM this afternoon. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue The entrance to the exhibition is at the main entrance of Wanzhu Elementary School on Luxiangyuan Road. A huge bamboo cloth banner hangs in front of the gate. There is a signing area at the entrance. A couplet hangs in front of the stage in the main auditorium: "Remarkable Achievements Obtained During the Holidays," "Diligent Homework with Careful Observation." The exhibition rooms are located upstairs and downstairs in the central and northern buildings. Boy Scouts provide service along the way, and the organizing committee sends personnel to serve as receptionists and marshals. This time, 57 schools participated with more than 25,000 exhibits, displayed in 14 rooms. The exhibits, all created by students in the third grade and above during the summer vacation, such as various plant specimens and artistic works, are quite excellent.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM. Present were Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education; Wang Longzhang, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters; Yan Wenkai, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau; and Zhou You, Hu Shuyi, Zhang Yongshou, Qian Fugong, Zhao Zengqi, guest Jiang Xicen, and more than 500 teachers and students from various schools. Director Pan served as chairman, Sun Yucai and Lü Xinfu as recorders, and Wu Renya as master of ceremonies. The ceremony proceeded as scheduled. First, the chairman reported, followed by Director Pan delivering a speech on behalf of Mayor Wu, and Wang Longzhang, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech. Guest Jiang Xicen gave a speech. The ceremony concluded at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Chairman Pan reported that the exhibition was originally scheduled to close on the 1st, but due to the large number of visitors, it was decided to extend it for half a day and close it at 12:00 noon on Sunday. A total of 57 elementary schools participated this time, with more than 25,400 exhibits. The exhibition is jointly organized by the Municipal Bureau of Education and the Children's Morning Post. The purpose is to encourage students to do homework during the holidays so that they understand that they should also study on their own during the holidays. This session is experimental in nature. Because the announcement was too late, schools had already started their summer vacation, so most of them did not have time to prepare and participate. Next year, the regulations will be announced earlier, and the Children's Morning Post will publish the topics and materials in each issue, and students will create their own during the holidays. After the start of school, they will be submitted to the schools, and the teachers will hold internal exhibitions, select exhibits, and then hold a city-wide exhibition. However, I would like to report to you that the purpose of holding this exhibition is to enable students to be automatic, self-study, self-made, and self-controlled. It is not allowed for schools to forge them. Now, perhaps many schools have the wrong idea that the grades are related to the school's reputation, and others make them on their behalf, pretending to be student works. This should be prohibited. First, we must make students break the concept of not working for gain. Second, the achievements of this exhibition will be used as the standard for next year, and we must make progress every year, which is a good achievement for the school. I hope that all schools will guide students not to waste their time during the summer vacation.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech Director Pan delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Wu, stating that the mayor could not attend today because he was attending the air defense coordination meeting. The mayor's intention is to make elementary school students understand the danger of the country and the importance of future responsibilities. Saving the country depends entirely on young people. The more dangerous the country, the greater the responsibility of young people. In the past, King Goujian of Yue endured hardship and made great efforts, and after ten years of recovery and ten years of training, he was finally able to destroy Wu and avenge his past shame. The so-called ten years of recovery and ten years of training is to tell everyone that the elderly and middle-aged people have no hope. Ten years of recovery and ten years of training is to cultivate new people. From childhood to ten years old, the body must be well nourished, and there must be many. After ten years old, add another ten years of strict training, and only at twenty years old can they become strong men who can defeat the Wu Kingdom. China must also teach and nurture children well. I hope that all of you children will work hard.</p>
<p>Start Judging The judging began yesterday afternoon. The judging committee members were Ni Wenya, Chen Xuanhan, Jiang Xicen, Dong Renjian, Zong Lianghuan, Zeng Shengdian, Ge Liting, Han Mingyi, Xu Yingchang, Hu Zuyin, Zeng Zhenqing, Zhou Peicheng, Huang Juemin, Zhang Zubei, and Shu Xincheng, etc. The exhibits from each school are divided into two types: competition and free participation, and judged by subject. Because the units are individuals and schools, the judging procedures are quite troublesome. Last night, the Municipal Bureau of Education invited the committee members to dine at the YMCA.</p>
<p>Health Guidance Health guidance and hygiene affairs are handled by Dr. Zhang Qi and nurse Jiang Yifan from the Health Bureau, who set up a separate hygiene room to handle hygiene business and provide family health guidance. If parents have any health or disease problems, they can go to ask.</p>
<p>Extended for Half a Day The exhibition was originally scheduled for one day. However, because the crowds of visitors yesterday blocked the roads, it was decided to extend it for half a day. It will close at 12:00 noon today. Before 12:00 noon, it will still be open to the public. The association welcomes parents to visit to build a foundation for communication between family and school and to promote the progress of students' physical, mental, and academic development. The time for each school to collect exhibits is from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM this afternoon.</p>

<p>The Commercial Press on Henan Road in this city initiated and held a physical fitness competition for children on Children's Day this year, which has won a lot of praise from the society. It is generally believed that it has great significance for children's education. In order to test children's intelligence, the library will hold an intelligence competition for young children in the library from the 20th to the 28th of this month, so that children's mental development and physical fitness can be properly developed at the same time. The first test and testers were all students of Junde Elementary School yesterday. The testing method is to print various pictures and ask children to use a red pencil to circle within five seconds, such as what is used for eating, what can fly, what is used together, what picture is painted well, etc. After the test, each child is given a picture book. After the competition is over, the results will be evaluated and prizes will be awarded. The top 20 will receive book coupons worth 5 to 20 yuan each. The original letter to the principals of various elementary schools is recorded as follows: Principal, we held a children's physical fitness competition on Children's Day this year, which was praised by educators and believed to have great significance for children's education.

<p>Ma Canhan, the principal of Qiaoguang Middle School in this city, resigned, and Qiu Hanping, the former principal, succeeded him. He went to the school yesterday afternoon to take over, and all the original staff remained in their positions. The truth is that Qiu Hanping initially did not want to take the position and advised Ma to continue to serve, so Ma still expressed his responsibility. However, the doctor advised Ma not to work hard because of his illness and needed long-term rest. After considering the results, Ma decided to concentrate on recuperating and strongly requested Qiu Hanping to come to the school to take over. The school convened all the students yesterday to report on the situation of the change of principal. Ma also published a statement in the newspaper that day.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Party Department Sends Personnel to Investigate the South <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>A trend of expelling the principal occurred in Southern Middle School. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Wang Longzhang, representative of the Municipal Party Department, went to Southern Middle School to investigate. He then summoned the principal and the director of academic affairs and other faculty members to talk about everything. According to reports, the turmoil was due to the principal's use of private individuals to sow discord and exclude dissidents, which led to disagreements among the people taking over.

<h3 id="e249">Little Hero Raises Eyebrows and Exceeds Expectations Zheng Zhaojia Defeats Carlson <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Overcomes the Shanghai Singles Champion 3-1</p>
<p>Wins the China Tennis Club Group A Championship</p>
<p>The result of the China Tennis Club Group A singles final yesterday was beyond expectations. The audience raised their eyebrows and rejoiced. Zheng Zhaojia lived up to expectations and defeated the Shanghai singles champion Carlson 3-1 to win the championship, regaining a lot of honor for Chinese tennis players. His skillful hitting is especially commendable. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia (6-4 3-6 6-2 6-3) Carlson</p>
<h3 id="e250">Hitting the Nail on the Head <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>The appropriate hitting and strategy were the main reasons for Zheng's victory over Carlson yesterday. Knowing yourself and knowing your enemy, you will win every battle. Zheng was able to attack Carlson's weaknesses, so he won. The cross-court rallies on both sides made Carl tired of running, and when Carl went to the net to intercept, Zheng was able to hit Carl's backhand with a cross-court shot, making Carl helpless. Standing in front of the net like a wooden chicken, therefore, he did not easily go to the net. Zheng did not use many lobs, so Carlson's smash could hardly be used. It is a pity that Zheng's smash is still weak and the action is still slow, otherwise controlling Carlson would be a matter of course.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Exhausted and Defeated <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Carlson was still trying to make a final struggle in the fourth set at 5-4, but he was exhausted and had to admit defeat. Carlson's performance yesterday, except for being able to run and move faster than Zheng, was far from satisfactory. Zheng's body yesterday was at its best. In contrast, Carlson was exhausted and tired, so even if he fought to the fifth set, there was no doubt that Zheng would win. Carlson had few chances to smash yesterday, and his serve was also wrong and weak. He was repeatedly defeated by Zheng in front of the net, and he was tired of dealing with long rallies, and he was listless, so how could he not be defeated?</p>
<h3 id="e252">Taking the Lead <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Except for the second set won by Carl, Zheng had an absolute advantage in the other three sets. 6-4 from 4-2 in the first set, 6-2 from 2-1 in the third set, and 6-4 from 5-2 from 3-1 in the fourth set. Even in the second set, which was won by Carlson, Zheng once led 3-1. Carlson won five consecutive games to win 6-3. Therefore, Zheng's victory yesterday was very easy. Carlson served first, and Zheng scored, so each scored one point each, and Zheng took a 4-2 lead with cross-court rallies on both sides. But Carl served and also won two consecutive games, making it 4-4. However, Carl's serve failed in the next game, and Zheng served. Carl touched the net three times in a row, and Zheng won the first set 6-4.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Continuing Efforts <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Carl still served first in the second set. Carl began to go to the net to intercept, but Zheng attacked Carl's backhand with a very skillful backhand cross-court shot, making Carl unable to return the ball. Zheng then won two consecutive games, leading 3-1. At this time, Zheng gradually saw many balls going out of bounds and not passing the net. Carlson took the opportunity to advance and won five consecutive games, winning the second set 6-3. At the beginning of the third set, Carl won two more games. Zheng was greatly encouraged and won six consecutive games in one breath, winning 6-2. Therefore, Zheng took the lead again with two to one.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Final Battle <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Carlson lost six consecutive games and lost the third set, and his physical exhaustion was obvious. During the rest period, the two regained their spirits, especially Zheng Zhaojia, who was not tired at all. Zheng served first and won, taking a 1-0 lead. Unfortunately, Zheng's serve failed in the next game. Fortunately, Carl's situation was not good, and he wanted to make a final bet, chasing it to 5-3. Zheng served and took a 40-30 lead, but Carl won and made it 5-4. At this time, the tension in the air was unparalleled. Because Carl served in the next game, it would become 5-5, and the future victory or defeat would be unpredictable. Zheng pulled it back from 30-40 to equality, passing through twelve equalizations, one after another, Carlson was exhausted and defeated, and the final set was 6-4.</p>

<p>Maple Floor Suitable for Skating, Tennis, and Basketball</p>
<p>Divided into Six Major Sections, Qiu Feihai Invited to Collaborate</p>
<p>The sports community of this city, in order to promote sports and provide a place for all sectors to exercise and strengthen their bodies, previously raised funds to build the large-scale Meiyuan Gymnasium on Route Ghisi, and invited Qiu Feihai and others to cooperate. Construction began some time ago and is expected to be completed by mid-next month. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Occupying Seven Mu with Excellent Facilities: The initiators believe that Shanghai is densely populated, but the facilities for sports are scarce. In order to make a significant contribution to the practice of both Chinese and foreigners, they raised 120,000 yuan to lease seven and a half mu of land on Route Ghisi in the French Concession to build the Meiyuan Gymnasium. The floor is made of the most durable maple wood. This wood can be used as a skating rink and as a hard tennis court, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Completion Next Month, Divided into Six Sections: This building was designed by Sandbrook &amp; Co. and constructed by Wu Cangji Construction Company. Since the start of construction, most of it has been completed and is scheduled to open around the 20th of next month. The construction capital is a Sino-Western joint venture. The main initiator, Mr. Scott, also invited tennis master Qiu Feihai to cooperate. Qiu believes that tennis is usually stopped in winter due to weather conditions. Now that there are indoor facilities, there are more opportunities for practice and no conflict of schedules. He expressed his approval. It is reported that the museum is divided into skating, tennis, boxing, fitness, basketball, and wine and card games.</p>

<p>Although the Stabilization Fund Has Been Established</p>
<p>The Gold Market Still Shows a Strong Upward Trend</p>
<p>Resulting in a Rebound of Thirteen Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market is showing a strong upward trend. Although there was a reaction the day before yesterday, the market rebounded again yesterday. Even with the establishment of the 100 million yuan stabilization fund, the upward sentiment is still difficult to suppress. As a result, the market opened slightly weak yesterday, but ended with a rebound. In the early morning, the foreign silver increased and the British rose, and the U.S. dollar remained flat, and the exchange rate increased slightly, but it was irrelevant. The price of London gold fell by five pence, and it was predicted that the Customs Gold (關金) listing would shrink, so the market opened outside the venue and was slightly weak, retreating to 834 yuan. The report that the stabilization fund jointly formed by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications decided to first use 100 million yuan to suppress the local exchange rate market caused a slight impact on people's hearts, and the selling side turned enthusiastic and broke the 80 yuan mark. After the opening, the market hovered around 80 yuan. The Central Bank's listing was announced, the British remained flat, and the U.S. dollar rose by 0.0625, the Customs Gold fell by six li, and the standard gold price was further reduced to 982 yuan and 6 jiao (cents). People's hearts were stable and there was not much impact. When the banks' appetite was insufficient, the gold market turned from stable to timid. HSBC's listing was announced, the British rose by half a penny, and the U.S. dollar increased by 1.125 yuan. Although there was not much stimulation, the domestic market suddenly hardened, and the gold market rebounded by nearly ten yuan. However, the chips showed dryness, and there was no large supply. After the buying side took advantage of the low price to move, it rose again to more than 80 yuan. Once the exchange rate stabilized, Chinese merchants were brave in covering their positions, and the gold price gradually rose again, but the overall trend was peaceful, with many fluctuations along the way. However, the upward trend was difficult for people to suppress in a short period of time. Afterwards, the situation turned favorable, and buying sentiment rose, breaking through the 90 yuan mark. However, the buying interest did not stop. Then there were rumors that our country had not reduced the equalization tax or revised the silver tax. Although the buyers did not surge, there was no supply. Before noon, it broke through the 1,000 yuan mark again. At this point, the gold market gradually saw supply, and there was slight pressure and declined. The noon closing showed a hovering state, and the situation for the day had turned mediocre, and the storm was also calm. The environment made it easy to rise and difficult to fall. The half-day market is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 980 yuan and 5 jiao, a decrease of 5 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the previous close. Although Hengchang, Yongfu, Xingyong sold at 79 yuan, the Central Bank's Customs Gold listing fell by 6 li, the British was flat, the U.S. dollar rose by 0.0625, and the standard gold price fell to 982 yuan and 6 jiao. At this time, there was quite a bit of struggle.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to the calm environment, the bond market trend already had an upward spiral. Swap transactions on the floor were quite lively, and mostly long swaps. However, market prices did not shrink due to this. Major players bought in slightly, and it was heard that yarn and cotton had risen sharply again, and sentiment was therefore firm.

Market prices rose slowly, and transactions were relatively clear. Market prices were slightly higher by 1-2 jiao to 4 jiao.

<p>Gold Prices Rebound, Spot Yarn Bounces Back</p>
<p>The yarn market rebounded, and the rising trend restarted. The reason for this is that the market discussion of inflation is rampant again. At the same time, a certain bank and money shop group are inclined to purchase, and gold prices have also rebounded. As a result, sentiment has recovered, and spot yarn sales in the market are also 1,800 bales, and the market atmosphere is better. Marked yarn rose by 4 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened in the morning, and because the previous day's decline was too strong, the number of new sellers decreased, causing profit-takers to cover their shorts, and the market rebounded. When it was auctioned to the 23rd lot, it suddenly jumped wildly. It was heard that a certain banker Wang had a large amount of purchases, so sentiment was agitated. At the same time, it was heard that gold prices had rebounded, and as a result, each month rose by 3 yuan and 57 jiao to 4 yuan and 4 jiao. The afternoon opened and fell by 6-7 jiao, and the second lot rebounded because there were 1,900 bales of spot yarn sold to customers, and sentiment was revived. When the auction closed, the market was slightly tired. As a result, the current month rose by 1 yuan and 4 jiao, and the far month fell by 1-2 jiao. The total volume for the day was 100,745 bales. It was found that Yu Zai sold 1,100 bales, Suilong 1,400 bales, Yuanda 1,350 bales, Jinchang 2,400 bales, Mingde 4,150 bales, Taixing 1,000 bales, Shenchang 4,150 bales, Hengde 1,500 bales, Shenji 1,000 bales, Changfeng 2,150 bales, Yuan Yi 4,000 bales, Yi Chang 1,800 bales, Tongfeng 2,000 bales, Xie Sheng 1,750 bales, Yuande 1,000 bales, Run Kang 4,150 bales.

<p>The cotton market rebounded, but the market atmosphere was not as high as the yarn market. Because exchange rates rebounded, and the American cotton market was not strong, a certain cotton company closed out a large number of long positions, which made the market slack. However, it is difficult to grasp the future situation.</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened in the morning, and because American cotton fell slightly, and the exchange situation was long, the yarn market led to a rise in the cotton market. However, Wang of a certain cotton company turned long to short, causing the rise in cotton prices to be relatively flat. Each month rose by 5, 6, 7 jiao. The second lot opened in the afternoon, and the market was quite tight. The far month fell back at the close. As a result, each month rose again by 5 fen to 2 jiao.

<p>The Most Buyers: Yi Da, 9,800 Bales</p>
<p>The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, the amount of marked yarn in the inventory, as of October 19, was found to be 19,100 bales for the October period, 48,300 bales for the November period, 62,950 bales for the December period, 71,000 bales for the January period, 65,300 bales for the February period, and 50,250 bales for the March period, totaling 316,900 bales. It was found that the market price of marked yarn has soared recently. Due to the increase in silver export tax, sentiment was stirred up, and buyers were excited. However, the long and short positions of both buyers and sellers have been shortened. Because the rise and fall are too great, it was found that the focus of the sellers is still pushing the Japanese merchants, and the buyers are the financial community and retail investors. The accounts with the largest long and short positions are excerpted below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was sluggish, and colleagues watched from the sidelines. It is estimated that the spot price fell by 5 pounds, and the futures price fell by 2 to 4 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 3 to 5 points. Indian cotton was strong due to purchases by European exporters and market speculators. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 1 rupee, and Aomula and Bailuoxi rose by 7 and a half jiao. The original telegram is on the left (19th telegram).</p>

<h3 id="e279">Grain and Flour Market Morning Fall, Afternoon Rise <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>The flour market opened with a small drop of 2-3 fen, due to the tired trend of the previous day, there were sales of both long and short positions, factories sold far-month contracts, and customers bought near-term contracts, so there was this small state. Then, the low price caused large off-market players to hoard and sell, and factories did not sell much in the far term, and supplementing near-term contracts was healthier, so the market turned sharply upward. In the afternoon, with the soaring price of gold, people's minds and the market both rebounded upward, and the far month was competed for by all parties, and the rise was even faster. The closing price of the current month rose by 3 fen and 25/100, the next month rose by 4 fen and 75/100, December rose by 5 fen and a half, January rose by 6 fen and 75/100, and February also rose by 6 fen and 75/100, etc.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the various months continued the downward trend of the previous day, and many long positions were nervously closed out, and new shorts were also sold, and the opening price immediately dropped by 6-7-8 fen. Then, due to the rise in gold prices and the sharp rise in flour prices, selling was stopped, and new hoarding and short covering became active, and the market rose step by step. The market atmosphere was even better in the afternoon, and the closing price of the current month rose by 8 fen, November and February rose by 4 fen, December rose by 7 fen, and January rose by 3 fen. Foreign wheat was reported at a small price of 2-3-4 jiao, but the rise in gold prices caused a large increase. Spot wheat was flat. Yesterday, Fuxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, Xinda, Shenda and others bought 13,000 bags at prices of 3 yuan and 6 jiao, 3 yuan and 5 jiao and a half, medium and secondary prices of 3 yuan and 4 jiao and a half to 2 yuan and 3 jiao and 7 fen, etc.</p>
<p>Because the US government's policy is unclear, the coarse grain market cannot progress. At present, rumors are rampant, saying that during the next congressional session, the government will ask for greater power to manage coarse grain transactions. Currently, the foreign market is weak, and market prices are unlikely to rise greatly. Wheat opened with heavy selling, and market prices fell, but quickly rebounded. Public opinion believes that the market will not fall sharply. If the foreign side can provide considerable stimulus, the market will be high, because the domestic situation is very good.</p>

<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, a total of more than 20 ships arrived from various gangs (nearly 4,000 shi of goods in total). Customer gangs such as Qingdao, Yantai, and Beijing-Tianjin and other gangs purchased nearly 800 bags. However, this street seems to be slightly sluggish, so although the kiln seed market continued to rise, the situation was not as strong as the previous day, with the Chestnut Ridge price increasing by half a jiao to two jiao. This was entirely stimulated by the buying interest. Thick new japonica rice such as white paddy only increased by one jiao in terms of sight, and the market situation was slightly tight. Du Yang Jian high-grade materials were fresher in color, and the middle market was flat. As for broken rice and variable yuan rice, there was still no glory or shame. Fortunately, there was some movement in new yin yuan rice, and the market color was quite brisk, and prices were high by one or two jiao.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, the arrival of goods from various places in He Xia was very rare, only 11-12 ships. Various colors of purchases in the market, broken japonica rice, new japonica rice, new Du Jian rice, and guest jian rice were active in the early market, and turned flat in the later market. There was a lack of kiln seed Hundred Brother rice, and little new sheep Jian rice, and sales were not good. Chen Baiyuan rice with a solid square center was rarely traded. Chen Chen's new and old ports were ordinary. In terms of market conditions, the price of broken japonica rice increased by one jiao, the price of high-grade new japonica rice increased by one jiao, and the price of medium and secondary materials increased by one jiao. The evening market turned tired, the price of new Du Jian rice and new sheep rice was tight by several fen, the price of Chen Baiyuan rice continued to rise by one jiao, and the new Chen Port Jian rice and Yin Yuan rice showed a tightening trend, the new Du Jian rice increased by another jiao, and the new guest Jian rice tightened by three or five fen.</p>
<h3 id="e281">Customer Xian Rice Sales Are Active in the Mainland <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign customer xian rice saw mixed gains and losses. There was sufficient inventory of foreign rice in the market, but cargo owners did not send samples, and the appetite on this street was also fragrant, so the market turned flat. Saigon's current rice was not open, and the mainland was competing to handle Siamese rice, and it was close to one jiao. Annam japonica rice arrived from Hong Kong, and the market was stable. A total of 4,000 bags of various foreign rice were opened throughout the day, and 100 tons of forward foreign rice was returned, with the price still being 5 yuan. Customer xian brown rice arrived yesterday and the day before yesterday, and it was also heard from a telegram from Shashi that the ban on rice in that area had been lifted, and a large number of brown rice would be shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, yesterday, cargo owners depreciated their prices and sought sales. Although transactions were strong, 4,200 bags were opened, and the price was slightly lower by one jiao. There was not much inventory of customer xian rice, and little arrived. Yesterday, the mainland was active, and this street also had an appetite, so the price immediately increased by 2 jiao, etc.</p>

<p>Chongming New Sand Soybeans Hit the Market</p>
<p>Recently, the bean cake market has been active. The price of old soybeans has risen above three yuan. Factories are considering trial production with new soybeans. Yesterday, Da You Factory purchased 600 bags of Xiaoshan new soybeans for the first time, priced at only two yuan and eight jiao, which is cheaper than old soybeans. The market also hopes to test them to see if the oil color and cake yield meet requirements, thus opening up a new avenue for new soybeans. However, market conditions remain sluggish, falling another seven to eight fen compared to the previous day. The first batch of Chongming new sand soybeans, 24 bags, arrived the day before yesterday. The quality was not good, and the price opened at three yuan and three jiao. Yesterday, the second batch of 20 bags arrived, with slightly better quality. The seeds were still uneven in size, and the price opened at three yuan and four jiao. The supply of new Pudong soybeans remains scarce, with each arrival totaling less than 20 bags, priced at five yuan and two jiao and a half per shi dan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market, although benefiting from the rebound in gold prices, was affected by it being Sunday, with no shipments, and limited trading, leading to a softening trend. The Public Association's quoted price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was 19 yuan and 05 fen for spot goods, down half a jiao from the previous day. Dock delivery was 19 yuan and 1 jiao, down two jiao from the previous day. Transshipment goods remained stable without any changes. Dutch red sugars were all quoted at the original prices, with little trading. The price of local factory refined white sugar rebounded by one jiao, with No. 1 at 17 yuan and 8 jiao, No. 2 at 5 jiao, No. 3 at 2 jiao, and No. 4 at 16 yuan and 9 jiao. Taikoo sugar B mark remained at 20 yuan, and CW mark at 19 yuan and 7 jiao, down one jiao. The market for domestic Chaoqing sugar was firm, with 300 bags opened yesterday, with the high end at 12 yuan and a half, and the ordinary at 12 yuan, unchanged from the previous day.</p>

<p>Recently, due to rising land prices, the Xu Kui Zi market in Shanghai has slightly rebounded, rising by two to three jiao. If calculated based on purchase prices, it would have to be above nine yuan. However, local market quotes are higher, selling at eight yuan and seven to eight jiao, and the ordinary at eight yuan and five to six jiao, forming an inverted situation. Therefore, the supply has decreased. If sales are brisk in the future, there is hope for further increases.</p>

<p>Since the rise in foreign exchange rates, the woolen cloth market has improved by one-third in terms of prices. Pure wool plain thick woolen cloth in navy blue is even five to six fen per yard higher than navy blue. Existing stocks from foreign firms such as Baoda, Li Hua, and Bobo have been snapped up by woolen cloth traders one after another, with wholesale sales and retail purchases, leading to a revival in the market. Yesterday, Baoda's No. 1 plain thick woolen cloth sold for four yuan and eight jiao, No. 2 for three yuan and seven jiao and a half, Hua Bo for three yuan and five jiao, and Ruiwen No. 1000 for three yuan and two jiao and a half.</p>

<p>— Jin Xi</p>
<p>Generally speaking, toys are our children's second life. Toys can develop our emotions, senses, knowledge, and will.</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, according to a survey by the International Trade Bureau, the total number of foreign games and toys imported in the past eight months amounted to over 664,000 national currency, an increase of one-fifth compared to last year (last year's total was over 580,000). Among them, Japanese toy imports were the most numerous. Therefore, our children have developed a contradictory mentality. We cannot do without toys, but the drain on resources from toys is such an alarming figure. Facts do not allow us to need toys anymore. If we want toys again, we are not patriotic; if we love the country, we can no longer have toys.</p>
<p>In fact, we don't need to worry so much. In the future, we have two ways to remedy the drain on resources from toys: (1) Make our own toys. We follow the toy-making methods in books and make them ourselves, and ask the craft teachers in the school to guide us. (2) Buy domestic toys. If the structure of the toy is too complicated for us to make, then we will buy domestic toys and ask our parents to carefully identify the trademarks.</p>

<p>The current British Prime Minister, MacDonald, is one who likes to read most. He is often reading, and reading hardly ever stops. When he deals with official business, he continuously reads the government documents page by page for several hours, and only stops when he has finished reading. This shows that he reads in order, not flipping through randomly and without order. Children often have a bad habit of reading. When they get a book, they look at the back without looking at the front; or they abandon reading this book before finishing it to look at that one. When asked what the book is about, they still cannot answer. This is very bad. We should take MacDonald as an example to learn how to read, so that we can comprehend the meaning. Reading is his lifelong habit. He liked to read, observe, and study all kinds of problems when he was a child. He often said to people, "The reason why he was able to develop to a new position was because of reading."</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, "In my life, apart from revolution, reading is my only hobby. I cannot live without reading for a day." He carried books with him even when supervising battles on the front lines, and his usual love of reading can be imagined. Therefore, he was able to write many books on academic theory.</p>
<p>When Zeng Wenzhenggong led troops, he had a set time for reading and writing every day as a routine task, which was never interrupted. Once, an epidemic spread among the troops, causing successive deaths, and they were surrounded by enemy troops. However, he remained undisturbed and recited as usual. With such a calm and focused spirit, he was not only good at martial arts but also good at literature.</p>
<p>Children, if you also want to become great people and save the country from difficulties, you must love reading.</p>

<p>— Hui Xian</p>
<p>Children! You should remember this sentence well... Victory belongs to the brave!</p>
<p>The brave are forward-moving and fearless. They defeat all obstacles and enemies. Victory belongs to them! The timid shrink back and will never have a successful career!</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, please read the following story.</p>
<p>Before the Russo-Japanese War, a Russian officer and a Japanese officer were drinking together in a tavern in Vladivostok. They both got very drunk, and then they started talking more, each exaggerating the soldiers of their own country. The two had a big argument. Finally, they decided to have their guards compete on the flat rooftop of the tavern.</p>
<p>First, the Russian soldiers practiced. When the team gradually approached the edge of the roof, the soldiers' steps, without prior agreement, began to shrink. When they reached the edge of the roof, they stopped marching and did not move forward, even though the officer did not shout the commands to halt or march in place.</p>
<p>Later, it was the Japanese soldiers' turn to practice, and they did it in the same way as the Russian soldiers.</p>
<p>However, when the Japanese soldiers approached the edge of the roof, they did not flinch at all. They still marched forward with their heads held high. When they reached the edge, the officer did not shout the command to halt, and they rushed off the roof and fell straight down.</p>
<p>This is a demonstration of bravery.</p>
<p>Later, in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan ultimately defeated Russia.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say: Victory belongs to the bravest! Children, remember it well.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Why Can't People Live Long! <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The length of an animal's life is directly proportional to the slowness of its growth. Those that grow quickly have short lives; those that grow slowly naturally have long lives. According to zoologists' estimates, the ratio between growth and age for ordinary animals is one to ten. For example, if a dog grows up in one year, it will live for ten years; if a cat grows up in six months, it will only have six years of survival. Animals like deer, cranes, and turtles grow very slowly, so their lives are also very long.</p>
<p>Humans grow up in sixteen years at the earliest and twenty years at the latest. According to the calculation, they should live to be one hundred and sixty to two hundred years old. Why don't we see people of such a great age? In reality, it is because humans are too intelligent. The rise and fall of the seven emotions and six desires has already discounted their age. The food they eat, cooked and fried, has so many varieties, which also makes the stomach and intestines prone to disease. In addition, as civilization evolves day by day, the body's original resistance also weakens day by day. Therefore, once attacked by disease, it is easy to die young. So the reason why people cannot live long is actually their own fault.</p>
<h3 id="e291">Ants with Social Organization <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Ruo Peng</p>
<p>I felt very bored at home and couldn't think of anything interesting to do as a pastime. After thinking for about half an hour, I came up with something that was very ordinary but very interesting.</p>
<p>I took a fly swatter and hit a fly. After looking at the ground for a long time, I found one or two ants. I dropped the dead fly next to the ants. Their antennae slightly touched it, and they tried to drag it with a little force, but it didn't move at all. Then, they climbed on the fly and kissed it with their sense of smell, and then ran down, shaking their heads, as if to call for reinforcements.</p>
<p>After a while, I saw a very orderly team of soldiers coming out of the cracks in the stone under the pillars, gradually approaching from a distance. Later, they actually reached their destination. Their order was very good. They worked together to drag the fly into the hole as if they were flying. However, there were still a few foraging ants running around outside.</p>
<p>After seeing this interesting thing, I felt that these very small animals were very good at maintaining order and neatness. Are we not as good as these small animals? Children! You should cultivate the spirit of ants. No matter when, you must have order and neatness. Then, when you go out into society, you will definitely be able to become good citizens!</p>

<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>The water vapor contained in the air will definitely condense when it encounters cold air, and this condensation is what forms clouds.</p>
<p>People who care about the weather must often look up at the clouds in the sky. Many clouds mean it will rain, few clouds mean the weather is very good, high clouds, low clouds, clouds moving south, clouds moving north, all can be observed from the clouds to see if the weather is good or bad. On the other hand, the shapes and colors of the clouds are very beautiful. When the sun rises or when the sun sets, the clouds at that time are so magical! Because of this, there are many kinds of clouds, distinctions, and names. It is necessary knowledge for children to study science!</p>
<p>Clouds can be roughly divided into ten types: (1) Stratus clouds, which are fog clouds, are the lowest type of cloud. On cloudy days, the ones covering the top of the hill are stratus clouds. (2) Nimbus clouds, also called chaotic clouds, are dark in color. When it rains, the black clouds stacked in layers are nimbus clouds. (3) Cumulus clouds are like overlapping white cotton, forming a round shape, and are most common in summer. (4) Thunderclouds, also known as cumulonimbus clouds, are a mixture of cumulus and nimbus clouds. The "cloud peaks" mentioned in books refer to this type of thundercloud. (5) Stratocumulus clouds are large, spiral-shaped, dark gray cloud masses. They look like it's going to rain, but they are not actually rain clouds. This type of cloud is most common in winter, blocking the sunlight and making the weather colder. (6) Cirrus clouds, also called streak clouds, are often seen in the blue sky as streaks like white brush bristles. If there is a slight breeze, it looks like smoke billowing from a flame. It is the highest type of cloud. Changes in the weather can be known by observing the direction of movement of this cloud. If it comes from the north, it means the weather is clear. If it comes from the south, the weather will be bad. (7) Cirrostratus clouds are formed by the accumulation of cirrus clouds covering the sky, like thin gauze. (8) Cirrocumulus clouds are small, white patches like fish scales, so they are also called scaly clouds. (9) Altocumulus clouds are similar to cirrocumulus clouds but larger, gray-white in color, and look like flocks of sheep in a pasture from a distance, so they are also called sheep clouds. (10) Altostratus clouds are gray and look like curtains stretched across the sky. They can often be seen before it rains, and are similar to nimbus clouds. Sometimes altostratus clouds can accumulate and form nimbus clouds.</p>
<p>Clouds are also related to cold climates. In the hot weather of summer, clouds can make it cooler. In the cold nights of winter, clouds can also make it warmer. Children may want to try it out.</p>
<h3 id="e294">Improved Windmill <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Cai</p>
<p>Children! Don't you like windmills very much? Indeed, windmills are a refined and interesting toy. If we make a few more with colored paper and string them together, they will be especially fun when they dance in the wind! However, ordinary windmills (as shown in Figure 1) not only waste paper but are also too monotonous. Now we have an improved windmill that seems to save paper and is more beautiful than the ordinary one. I would like to offer it to the children. The following is its manufacturing method:</p>
<p>If you want to make an eight-corner windmill, first cut the scrap paper into eight identical 45-degree triangles (as shown in Figure 2), then cut a small round piece of paper and paste the corner A of the eight triangular papers onto the small drawing paper in sequence (as shown in Figure 3). After pasting them firmly, paste one corner of the eight pieces of paper onto another small round piece of paper in sequence (as shown in Figure 4). The front and back are the same as ordinary windmills. Drill two holes and it's done. Children! Do you see! Isn't this kind of windmill much more beautiful than the ordinary one? If you want to make it more complicated, you just need to add a few more triangular pieces of paper, and twelve-corner and sixteen-corner shapes can also be made in the same way.</p>
<p>Also, if you think the windmill doesn't turn smoothly, you just need to glue a small paper ring (about 1 fen long and 1 and a half fen in diameter) to the bamboo skewer on the back of the windmill, and it will turn even more smoothly.</p>
<p>Using windmills to measure wind direction is often very accurate. If you want to play, make four windmills of the same size, connect them in a cross shape on a bamboo pole, and insert it in the highest place in the courtyard, and you can observe the wind. However, there are two things to pay attention to: First, make sure to identify the correct direction. Second, make a special and clear mark representing the direction on each of the four windmills.</p>

<p>— Li Kui</p>
<p>There was a toad who lived with its children in a puddle.</p>
<p>One day, a cow came to the puddle to drink water, and the little toads cried out, "Look, how big the cow is!"</p>
<p>"Big!" their mother said disapprovingly, "What's wrong with you! I think it's only a little bigger than me. If I puff up my belly, I can catch up with it!"</p>
<p>So, it took a long breath and tried its best to puff up its belly.</p>
<p>"Look!" it asked, "Am I as big as the cow this time?"</p>
<p>"Oh! No!" the little toads answered in unison.</p>
<p>It puffed up its belly again with more force, and it looked like its belly was about to burst.</p>
<p>"Am I as big as the cow this time?" it asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, no!" the little toads answered in unison again.</p>
<p>However, the toad was very unconvinced. It refused to stop and continued to puff up its belly as before, until: Bang! It burst into pieces.</p>

<p>I stood up and answered, "Feathers are the lightest!"</p>
<p>Kong, who was sitting opposite me, hurriedly interrupted, "Airplanes are the lightest."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu asked him, "How do you know?"</p>
<p>Kong said, "Because I often see feathers flying in the air, and they fall down soon, and they don't fly high; but I often see airplanes flying to very high skies, and they still don't fall down, so they must be lighter than feathers!"</p>

<h3 id="e298">Not Optimistic <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>After respectfully reading Dr. Hu Shih's article "Optimism in the Pessimistic Voices" published in the Dagongbao this month on the thirteenth, I don't know how many times I hesitated over the following paragraph.</p>
<p>"But the greatest and most easily overlooked progress in these twenty-three years is the social reforms in various aspects. The most obvious, of course, is the liberation of women. In terms of physical health, Chinese women around the age of twenty now not only have restored their health, but are also gradually becoming the most beautiful women in the world... In addition, the increase in women's economic and legal status, the increase in the number of women participating in professional and social political careers, the gradual changes in marriage customs, and the improvement of the social status of divorced women and remarried women are all major progress in Chinese society in the past twenty years."</p>
<p>Women have made such great progress in the past twenty years, and it is considered the greatest progress in China. We women can smile now! I am willing to sing in unison Mr. Shao Yuanchong's National Day song: "Drum it, citizens! Sing it, citizens! ... Internal peace and external defense, the country is prosperous and the people are healthy! The martial heroes shake the eight wildernesses! How dare those ugly things violate the natural order!" to express the joy in my heart!</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, throughout the country, public prostitutes, private prostitutes, dance hall prostitutes, wild pheasants running rampant, modern degeneration... all women selling their flesh, although there are no accurate statistics, I estimate that in the past twenty-three years, there have been at least more than twenty-three times more of them, right? Unable to stand on their feet in the countryside, they poured into the cities, exposing themselves to the public; finding a place to eat in the cities, they endured the humiliation and abuse of employers or foremen; unable to find a place to eat, they lay "shamelessly" in the crowded streets; these are things that women twenty-three years ago did not have. Even leaving aside the lower classes of society, how can the upper and middle classes of society not be sad? This year, what everyone is talking about about women is that they still can't find a proper way out, can't find a noble career, so they take women as the weak to relieve boredom and vent their anger? Isn't it that the thought of treating women as something to be bullied, ridiculed, and played with that existed twenty-three years ago has not been torn apart at all?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of women themselves, how much correction and reform have they been given from their families, schools, and society regarding the old tunes of dependence, obedience, vanity, conservatism, and other evils? The two or three outstanding and fortunate women have indeed gained a good position in society, but as far as women as a whole are concerned, this can only be regarded as climbing high and dangerously like a trumpet vine. If we are increasingly satisfied with this phenomenon and ignore the fact that the masses of women are in dire straits, it will only show that our women's movement is a bean sprout with insufficient sunlight and water; the higher it stretches, the weaker and more prone to withering it becomes! How can this be optimistic? If it is like Liu Chan, the Latter Ruler of Shu, who was detained in Luoyang and still claimed "I am so happy here that I do not miss Shu," then what is there not to be optimistic about?</p>
<p>The thoughts, habits, and various lifestyles of society still trample women underfoot. We don't care that there were Mencius's mother and Tai Si three or four thousand years ago, and we don't particularly care that there was Empress Wu and Ban Zhao three or four thousand years ago; we only hope that there is true gender equality and liberation now.</p>
<p>Many foreigners praise us a few times when they come to China; some time ago, a foreign writer even said he wanted to marry a Chinese woman, but soon he still embraced an American woman. Therefore, all insincere compliments, even if the speaker is well-intentioned, are nothing more than the kindness of an elder brother to ease the mind of a dwarf. We are really not optimistic about Dr. Hu's optimism.</p>
<h3 id="e299">The Work of Modern Soviet Women (Continued) <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— By M. E. Walker, Translated by Xue Jihui</p>
<p>Regarding medicine, I also observed another situation: women can do medical research work. I found that the director of a large microbiology institute was a middle-aged, short-haired woman surrounded by microscopes, artificially cultivated microbes, antitoxins, etc. While she was talking to me, one eye was still watching a test glass tube full of broth, speaking about her and her assistants' recent work, which was the movement to eradicate malaria in southeastern Russia. It was very interesting that her male colleagues obeyed her orders like ordinary students, without any resistance.</p>
<p>In a relatively large city, I saw that all the educational experiments in progress were full of female staff. All the staff in libraries and museums are usually women; men are rare in such buildings. They are well-educated, and their positions are conditional on being able to give lectures on art, literature, or music. In the work of this group, I also found that some women organized educational tours, giving interesting lectures on history or antiquities in the neighboring cities where they lived.</p>
<p>The nursery system allows female workers in factories or women working in the fields to hand over their children to a group of trained caregivers while they are at work. The government has no regulations regarding this system; in fact, the organization of all such nurseries is managed entirely by women. This may be because Russians cannot suppress their individuality and remove human relationships in their simplest actions. Another type of woman specializes in managing kindergartens. In the south, I saw a very beautiful city by the sea. The methods they use to teach children seem to be a combination of several systems of Froebel, Montessori, and N.E.U., yet unlike any of them. The children are of course very happy, full of meaning, often expressed in sand piles, perforated paper, or loess. Outsiders may be surprised at how Russia deals with speculators and criminals—their punishments are usually very severe—but there is actually no secret. A large team of women specializes in this work. They mingle with the shoppers in the vegetable market or on the busy streets of the city while buying things. They pay close attention to everyone passing by. They are very familiar with all the tricks of fraud, especially those that harm the interests of the state. Therefore, these behaviors rarely escape their keen observation. They are clearly the great enemies of deceivers; if they discover fraudulent behavior, there will be severe punishment. If the deceived person is a worker, they will be dealt with even more severely. If the person who takes advantage is not a righteous worker, their punishment will be even more severe.</p>
<p>In fact, education in Soviet Russia is entirely managed by women. Almost all important positions in the Ministry of Education are occupied by women. They have the power to appoint new teachers and to review textbooks. They are engaged in promoting adult education and eliminating illiteracy. They pay particular attention to the education of new recruits, so the countryside is full of educational slogans and posters. Traveling cinemas often travel from one city to the next with films and pictures to promote the prevention and treatment of various epidemics. Women are often part of the staff in vehicles carrying such propaganda materials.</p>
<p>Moscow has a special agency that specializes in studying all aspects of female labor in factories. Each industrial building has its branch office, which manages all female labor in Russia. No female worker can be dismissed without the approval of this agency; even if a female worker is suspended for inappropriate conduct or other errors, she must wait until a second position has been found for her before she can voluntarily transfer and be managed by a new superior. Women not only manage all matters concerning women in commerce and industry, but also participate in the management and supervision of the following matters: the receipt and expenditure of funds, the surplus of profits, the insurance of all employees and goods, the taxes payable by employers, the standard inspection of goods when they leave the factory, the amount of work required by each worker, the convenience afforded to trainees during their work, the clubs established in various industrial centers, organized entertainment time, and various facilities for illiterate workers to learn to read and write.</p>
<p>Women have already achieved very outstanding results and at the same time are not constrained by unreasonable jealousy in the legal profession. I spent an entire afternoon in the office of a motherly female lawyer, listening carefully to appeals of various grievances that might be settled without going to court. I was very happy to listen there. Most of the litigants are farmers, who are mostly in disputes with their neighbors over various farming tools, household items, and livestock. An old man came to ask if there was any way to get the new young doctor to re-install the teeth he had extracted the week before; he was completely against this new treatment method because his old friends no longer revealed his lips. An angry young woman came to protest the spitting habits of the elderly people she lived with, which violated the ban. After office hours were over in the afternoon, the good lawyer gave me the case records to look at, which were to be sent to a female clerk in the local court. The female clerk's responsibility is to check whether the summonses are correct and whether the witnesses appear on time. This is another position that women have only recently participated in. If we unfortunately have to go to court, I believe that the annoying situation of not keeping time will be reduced by at least 50 percent.</p>
<p>One day, the light in the room where I lived was broken, so I notified the female inspector of the public lighting administration. I was wrong; I notified the female supervisor of the public utility bureau. This public utility bureau manages water, electricity, transportation, and street cleaning. I thought that the repair work was also under its jurisdiction. The female inspectors here pay close attention to the conditions of all public bathhouses, public laundries, and cooperative residences. Damaging or wasting public property is punished very severely. They fixed the broken light in a very short time. If they are just as quick with other tasks, then there must be very few residents in this city who feel dissatisfied with all the facilities.</p>
<p>What is felt after contacting modern Soviet women is that the overall trend in this country is to bring women out of the home and entrust them with the management of the country's needs for honest and compassionate work. There is no doubt that Soviet women can be faithful and responsible for their work. She has completely overturned a system that the world has long accepted, that is, the system that regards men as the sole driving force of local and central government. Even the harshest critics cannot deny that their judgment has no obvious errors, nor do they shrink from difficulties.</p>
<p>All the women's work I have seen shows a missionary-like spirit. This spirit is probably inspired by the fearless spirit of the women who encouraged adventurous migration in primitive times. It seems to be the great source of transforming the entire life of the Soviet Russian nation. As for emotion, it has absolutely no place. What binds it together is a continuous chain composed of cooperative links. Each link is forged from enthusiasm, and the number of new links being forged is limitless. This is work, work with will and purpose—a new system. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e300">A Brief Description of Contraception <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor Guo Taihua</p>
<p>Contraception and abortion, although their motives and purposes are often the same, differ entirely in nature and severity in legal and social issues. After all, no matter how rigidly those who adhere to the old morality may be, they can never recognize the killing of immature sperm as a violation of criminal law. And in the real world of economic collapse and complex human affairs, who does not know the importance of the theory of birth control? Therefore, I will briefly describe the methods of contraception as follows.</p>
<p>(A) Natural Contraception</p>
<p>(1) Periodic Contraception: Women ovulate every month, mostly during the eight days from the 12th to the 19th day before menstruation. An egg is released on one day. This is a fact recognized by physiologists and gynecologists in recent years. Therefore, last year, Dr. Ogino of Japan wanted to formulate a periodic contraception method based on this ovulation period, that is, to prohibit sexual intercourse within these eight days. In the monthly menstrual cycle, all days other than these eight days are called infertile periods, and sexual intercourse can be carried out at will, and natural infertility can be achieved. This method is actually of little effect, because the ovulation period of women is indeed only within these eight days, but after sexual intercourse, the survival period of sperm in the female reproductive organs is not as short as Dr. Ogino predicted. Because if sperm reaches the uterine cavity and the lower end of the fallopian tube, it can survive for 21 to 24 days. That is, at the time of sexual intercourse, although the egg has not been released, the sperm can wait in the reproductive organs. When the egg is released into the fallopian tube several days later, the sperm can still combine with the egg for pregnancy even 21 days after sexual intercourse. Therefore, the application of this method often fails. As far as the author knows, there are countless women who conceive two or three days before menstruation and one to four days after menstruation. These two or three days before menstruation and one to four days after menstruation are of course the so-called safe period by Dr. Ogino. It can be seen that this periodic contraception method is not reliable.</p>
<p>(2) Coitus Interruptus: That is, suddenly stopping sexual intercourse before the male is about to ejaculate. This method is difficult to implement and has a very bad impact on both husband and wife. It should not be used.</p>
<p>(3) Reduced Sexual Intercourse: That is, reducing the number of sexual intercourses. This method not only cannot prevent pregnancy, but also makes it easier to conceive.</p>
<p>(4) Specific Ejaculation Method: When the male ejaculates, he ejaculates outside the vulva, or presses the lower part of the prostate gland with his hand to make the semen turn back halfway. This method is also difficult to implement, and both the physical and mental health of both parties are adversely affected. Especially the method of pressing back halfway can cause swelling, inflammation and pain in the male urethral corpus spongiosum, which is even more harmful.</p>
<p>(B) Artificial Contraception</p>
<p>(1) Mechanical Contraception: For men, there are caecum penile sheaths, rubber penile sheaths, and glans sheaths. This method is more effective for contraception, but the sheath often has slight cracks, and sperm will flow out from the broken hole, so it still cannot prevent pregnancy, and it is very harmful to both husband and wife, especially to the woman. Frequent use can lead to female frigidity, hysteria, chlorosis, anemia, and other diseases; for men, it can lead to mental depression, premature ejaculation, and general weakness, which is no different from the harm of frequent masturbation. Therefore, this method should not be used frequently; female contraceptive devices include cervical caps, uterine suppositories, vaginal balls, uterine needles, and sponge plugs, etc.; except for the cervical cap, the other four are not very effective and are very harmful, such as cervical ulceration, uterine inflammation, and cervicitis, etc. Only the cervical cap is relatively usable, but the cervical cap must be purchased according to the size of the woman's cervix. At the same time, it is difficult to put on the cervical cap by oneself, even if someone else puts it on, it is often not put on the cervix correctly, so sperm can still enter the uterus from tiny gaps and conceive, so the effect is often inaccurate, and the cervical cap can also cause cervicitis and cervical erosion.</p>
<p>(2) Washing Contraception: That is, after sexual intercourse, use a gynecological douche with acidic medicinal liquid or weak sterilizing medicine to wash the vagina, such as salicylic acid, carbolic acid, boric acid, Lysol, etc. with 2% warm boiled water 98%. Although this method is effective, it is very harmful. Because this type of medicinal liquid that can kill sperm always has a stimulating effect. Over time, the nerves of the vaginal mucosa become numb, or vaginitis or cervicitis and other harms occur, and the application is also more cumbersome.</p>
<p>(3) Pharmaceutical Contraception: This refers to the contraceptive medicines made in various countries and sold in pharmacies. Because this type of over-the-counter contraceptive medicine is easy to use, it is only inserted into the bottom of the vagina before sexual intercourse, so most ordinary contraceptive women use it. However, there are countless products of this type of contraceptive medicine in various countries, with many names and different types. Now I will briefly describe several of its main components, such as potassium permanganate, boric acid, alum, tannic acid tartrate, cinchona bark, etc. They are all intended to kill sperm. However, due to the limited medicinal power, the sperm cannot be killed completely. Sometimes it is often ineffective.</p>
<p>(4) X-ray Contraception: Using appropriate X-ray irradiation can also prevent eggs from maturing and being released during a specified period of three, four, six or seven years. However, even if an experienced X-ray expert is irradiating, a slight negligence can often lead to permanent infertility, and endocrine abnormalities can occur, causing adverse effects on the whole body.</p>
<p>(5) Serum Contraception: Invented by Touessinov and Katcha of Soviet Russia. The fundamental theory is Spermiimmunitaet. Recently, biologists from Germany and the United States have also begun to study it. This method is to first inject live sperm into the blood of a certain animal. The blood in this animal's body will naturally produce a kind of antagonistic immune element to fight and destroy sperm. Then take this serum with antagonistic sperm immune element and make it into a contraceptive injection needle. It is said that Soviet Russia has recently produced this type of serum contraceptive needle. The theory of this method is also very correct. Animal experiments have been successful in Soviet Russia. However, what is the effect of implementing it in humans? Does it have any adverse effects on the human body? Because the author of this article has not used it, and experts from various countries have not yet made detailed announcements, so it is not known. At the same time, this type of injection seems to be not yet sold in our country.</p>
<p>(6) Endocrine Fluid Contraception: Women no longer continue to ovulate and have no menstruation during pregnancy. This is the inhibitory effect of the corpus luteum and placental endocrine. Therefore, recently, doctors in various European and American countries, based on this theory, have used corpus luteum and placental endocrine agents for injection as short-term contraception, that is, ovulation stops for one to two months after one injection, and pregnancy cannot occur. When the time comes, another injection is given on schedule. Recently, the Jnfeundin contraceptive drug produced in Germany and other so-called needle drugs are mostly made according to this theory. The theory of this method is indeed correct, but the existing preparations have not been researched for a long time, so they have not been refined and purified. In terms of application, the expected effect is often not achieved. In the near future, European and American countries may invent more ideal and complete preparations based on this theory and many experiments.</p>
<p>(7) Surgical Contraception: Using surgery to remove the testicles of men or the ovaries of women by a doctor can of course permanently prevent pregnancy. However, the mental and physical health of both men and women will be greatly affected, so it can never be used. The removal of the vas deferens, fallopian tubes, and uterus also causes permanent infertility. If fertility is needed again, it is impossible to save it. Other methods of ligating the vas deferens and fallopian tubes also have the disadvantage of permanent infertility. Therefore, among surgical contraception methods, the fallopian tube displacement method is relatively good. If you want to have children again, you can have another surgery to move the fallopian tubes back to their original position, and you can still conceive as usual. However, using surgery for contraception seems to be making a big deal out of a small issue.</p>
<p>In summary, under the modern medical situation, many contraceptive methods, except for surgical methods, cannot be called absolutely safe, but they only reduce the chance of conception relatively. And the endocrine fluid method and the serum method. If they can be researched and completed in the future. Or they are close to ideal and promising.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Comparison of Marriage Ages in Various Countries <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>According to a recent survey by the Health Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs, the average marriage ages of men and women in various countries in the world are shown in the following table. Unfortunately, China, which is known for its early marriage, is not included.</p>
<p>Country Male Female Difference in Age</p>
<p>Years Years Years</p>
<p>Japan 28.89 24.08 4.81</p>
<p>Italy 29.0 24.4 4.6</p>
<p>Union of South Africa 29.7 24.6 5.1</p>
<p>Canada 29.3 25.1 4.2</p>
<p>Australia 28.7 25.2 3.5</p>
<p>Germany 29.3 26.2 3.1</p>
<p>New Zealand 29.9 26.2 3.7</p>
<p>Soviet Russia 29.4 26.5 2.9</p>
<p>Sweden 30.6 26.9 3.7</p>
<p>Switzerland 30.3 27.2 3.1</p>
<p>From the table above, we can see that the Japanese have the earliest marriage age. The difference in age between men and women is the largest in the Union of South Africa, followed by Japan, and the smallest in Soviet Russia.</p>
<h3 id="e302">Women of Jilin <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Li Kui</p>
<p>At first glance, these five characters "Women of Jilin" seem to have nothing to say. As if the women of Jilin are no different from the women of other places: in the cities, there are many wives and young ladies kept by the rich, and many prostitutes and secret prostitutes who specialize in satisfying men's desires; in the countryside, there are many virtuous wives and good mothers who specialize in raising children, cooking, and making clothes for their husbands... These are almost the same in all provinces. Of course, I can't say anything new.</p>
<p>In this way, I have nothing to say? Not at all! The women I want to talk about are definitely not these women who are no different from those in other provinces; but a kind of women who have special characteristics. They look the same as the women in other places; but the lives they live and the things they do are different from the women in other places.</p>
<p>There were not many of these women before the "September 18th" Incident; only in the countryside of Yanji and Wangqing counties; after the "September 18th" Incident, the number of these women increased. Not only did the number of these women increase in these two counties; but also in Panshi and Huadian counties, there were also these women.</p>
<p>They are the same as men; they want to wear the clothes of the righteous army. Needless to say, you can't tell they are women at a glance; even if you look closely, you feel that they are the same as men.</p>
<p>The men in the volunteer army in these four counties (of course, in addition to these four counties, there are others; but these four counties are the most) do not distinguish between nationalities; there are Koreans and Chinese; of course, women are also the same as men, and they do not distinguish between nationalities.</p>
<p>After the "September 18th" Incident, the power of the volunteer army in these four counties expanded even more, and they organized many vanguard teams, daredevil teams... Each team has one-third of women working. Some of them go to the front line to fight against the Japanese and "Manchukuo puppet state" troops; some do work in the rear.</p>
<p>Their marriages are not bound by the old ethics, nor are they controlled by money; their marriages are absolutely free. For example, when they and their lovers fall in love to the point of marriage, they immediately move in together to cohabitate.</p>
<p>Although their lives are very hard (because they feel a lack of material things due to the oppression of the Japanese), their spirits are indeed happy; when they do things, they are always very agile, practical, and energetic; so the men call them "happy people!"</p>
<h3 id="e303">The Starting Point of Women's Relief Work <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yi</p>
<p>The lives of Chinese women are of course very painful, but the only way to implement relief is to rely on women's own efforts. Begging for pity from others will ultimately be of no avail; but in the current situation, how can these oppressed women who have lost their ability to help themselves alleviate their suffering? It is necessary to seek it from the existing relief work in society. Regarding relief work, in theory and implementation, countries may have slight differences due to different backgrounds and positions; but it originates from the human nature of sympathy and mutual assistance, which is the same in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. However, if this point of sympathy and mutual assistance is taken as the basis for relief work, the result will be that society will only add a group of idlers. At its extreme, it can make the entire nation sink! Especially in today's China, when the nation is weak and the country is in danger, we have to talk about the issue of women's relief. It is necessary to recognize the following two points:</p>
<p>(1) Relief is for no relief; in other words, relief is for the sake of avoiding relief. American sociologist Edward T. Devine said in his book Principles of Relief; "The beauty of wisdom teaches people to help themselves. And through material and spiritual assistance, develop the independence and frugality of the relieved." Therefore, the fundamental purpose of relief should be to educate and increase the knowledge of the relieved on how to live a useful life, and not to cultivate dependence. This is the principle that all relief work should follow, and it is not unique to women's relief.</p>
<p>(2) The decline in the status of Chinese women and the suffering in their lives, although somewhat disjointed and irrelevant; but point out the defects of the social, economic, educational system, so that women lose their ability to help themselves and have to ask for help. Therefore, those unfortunate women who are kept in relief institutions should not only be educated to develop their ability to make a living, but also to improve their status, break all ideas and systems that value men over women, and cultivate their independent personality. This is a point that must be clearly recognized when discussing women's relief.</p>
<p>We use these two points to measure the so-called women's relief institutions in Shanghai today; some raise without teaching, some don't even talk about teaching, and even raising can't be satisfied; some take care of teaching, but the results are not good. All the houses are either crude or borrowed, and the poor equipment cannot be denied. Some institutions, although they have definite funds, have no measures, which is really a pity. As for those who run this business, most of them are stupid, old-fashioned, and lack of knowledge, which is a common phenomenon everywhere. Therefore, although the name and regulations of the Qingjie Hall are still in place, there should be no perfect place for educating and raising prostitutes and other oppressed women.</p>
<p>The management of women's relief institutions in Shanghai is so corrupt. Naturally, it is hoped that the government will determine the direction and reform them based on the above theories. It is also hoped that women's movement groups will do this practical work to supplement the government's shortcomings. In the current situation where both public and private economies are tight, there is no need to talk empty talk about how idealized the formal equipment should be; but there are not a few charitable institutions in Shanghai with considerable assets, but they will not make good use of them, so there is no hope for the development of the business. After that, the part of the business related to women's relief should be concentrated and unified in one place to avoid the current problems of being divided and scattered and acting on their own; the form should only be clean and need not be beautiful; in terms of spirit, it cannot be separated from the two points mentioned above. This is the starting point of women's relief work, and a slight difference will lead to a great deviation.</p>

<h3 id="e304">The Meaning of Life, Where Does It Lie? <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Wen</p>
<p>Because each person's life is different, and their views vary, there are various different explanations for the meaning of life. A miser says that the meaning of life lies in making money; people should live and die for money. A poet who worships the goddess Venus says that the meaning of life lies in love; people live for love and their reproductive organs. Pessimists say "life is like a dream," and that everything is meaningless... These are all explanations of the meaning of life from people's own standpoints.</p>
<p>However, we cannot therefore say that life has no definite meaning at all, and that there are only various views or philosophies of life held by different people. We cannot say that, because while there are many different opinions on this issue, and these opinions all have a certain social basis, we cannot consider them all to be correct, and therefore place them all on the same line, saying that the meaning of life can be interpreted in many ways and cannot be definitively judged. We know that truth has its relativity and its absoluteness. The interpretation of the question "Where does the meaning of life lie?" also has its relative and absolute meaning. In the relative relationship of various different interpretations, each interpretation is correct. But in a certain time and space, there is a correct interpretation among these relative interpretations, and this correct interpretation is absolute. Therefore, no matter how many opinions there are on the question of life, we can still find the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Human knowledge has developed to the point where we recognize the following things:</p>
<p>First of all, humans are the most intelligent of all things. Humans not only have feet and hands, but also a special brain; they not only have instincts, but can also act consciously. Other animals can only instinctively rely on their claws or other things to survive; they can only adapt to the environment, not change it. Humans are different. They can make tools and use tools to conquer nature. They not only adapt to the environment, but can consciously change it. Therefore, humans can improve their lives day by day, can progress from eating raw meat and drinking blood to eating fine cuisine and drinking beer, and can progress from living in caves to living in dozens of stories high buildings, and even to higher stages. Humans are animals that evolve day by day, not animals that degenerate.</p>
<p>At the same time, humans are social animals and cannot exist without society. The so-called evolution of mankind is the evolution of society. Obviously, in primitive society, humans could only eat raw meat and drink blood, and live in caves. Only after a contemporary society exists can they eat fine cuisine and live in tall buildings. The ability of humans to progress from eating raw meat and drinking blood and living in caves to living in buildings and eating fine cuisine is acquired with the social evolution from primitive society to modern society. Therefore, if humans want to improve their lives day by day, and make their lives more comfortable and beautiful, they must work hard to promote social evolution.</p>
<p>However, not all people in society welcome social evolution. In fact, under certain people's realistic, special life conditions, they not only do not promote social evolution, but desperately try to prevent the wheels of history from moving forward. The opposition of feudal aristocrats to scientific civilization in the past, and the oppression of all progressive movements of mankind by modern imperialism, are all manifestations of attempts to hold back the advancing wheels of history and to implement regression. Therefore, to promote social evolution and improve human life, we must not only fight against nature, but also fight against those who prevent social progress. The evolution of human society is the development of the contradiction of mankind's continuous struggle with nature and the continuous conflict with human beings themselves.</p>
<p>The so-called meaning of life lies in striving to conquer nature and fighting against all forces that prevent human progress, so as to promote the evolution of human society, so that human beings can live better. If we don't think this is the case, then where does the meaning of life lie? Is it really necessary for people to live a life of drunken dreams? Or should we really turn the wheels of history backwards and return to the Middle Ages or even the ancient times of eating raw meat and drinking blood? I think that as long as people are not degenerate to the point of being irredeemable, as long as they are not absolute advocates of degeneration, they will never give an affirmative answer to this.</p>
<p>Some people here are probably going to ask: In the present, how should we promote the evolution of society? Our answer is: Truth is concrete, and the solution to problems is also concrete. At present, to concretely determine how to promote social evolution, we must concretely understand the current reality. Because we must rely on the actual situation to determine the specific methods for promoting social evolution, and also to concretely determine the direction in which we should strive in life, that is, to concretely determine the meaning of our lives. Otherwise, we will become utopians. For example, people living in the Middle Ages, if they do not care about the real situation and only think about progress and leaps, trying to jump to the "kingdom of freedom" all at once, that is an illusion, a utopia. It must be known that human society evolves gradually, and it must be based on a certain realistic foundation before it is possible to evolve to a higher stage. Under this possibility, human efforts can have results, otherwise it will be in vain. The so-called meaning of life is to make concrete decisions based on the real situation under the principle that mankind should promote social evolution.</p>

<h3 id="e305">Basic Knowledge vs. Specialized Knowledge <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Ruo Fu</p>
<p>All human knowledge and learning does not come from the vast space, but is a product of society. Long before human society appeared, there would never be knowledge about science, philosophy, politics, economics, art, literature... in the universe, and therefore there would be no academic existence. The idealist Schopenhauer said in his "The World as Will and Representation": "...Even if the universe did not exist, if there was the existence of wind, there would still be music." What a mysterious statement! Think about it, without a certain rhythm and harmony, just blowing wind, how can it be called music? It must be known that music is also artificial, and it is also produced from the labor life of human beings. Without people, without human society, there would never be the existence of music.</p>
<p>Because all academics are products of society, we must understand them from a social point of view, no matter whether we are studying politics, economics, philosophy, science, art, literature... or even technical knowledge. No matter what subject you specialize in, you must have a basic knowledge of social science in order to enter the field and explore its essence and its occurrence and development. Otherwise, you will enter a mysterious realm and be unable to extricate yourself.</p>
<p>At the same time, studying any subject requires correct methods, otherwise there will be no way to start. In this regard, philosophical knowledge is even more indispensable for researchers of all subjects. Because from a methodological point of view, philosophy is the foundation of social sciences, natural sciences... Without philosophical thinking, without scientific methods, any subject cannot be recognized or grasped. Therefore, any expert must not only have general social science knowledge, but also have the basic theory of philosophy, otherwise, their research is still problematic.</p>
<p>There are many natural scientists, artists, writers... in society who do not understand the importance of general social science knowledge and basic philosophical knowledge. They only know how to bury themselves in their specialized subjects, despise social sciences and philosophy, and sing the song of "science for science" and "art for art"... As a result, other than kneeling before God and begging for solutions to problems, they are dominated by money bags and become slaves to money. In modern times, there are many natural scientists, such as the famous Newton, Thomson.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Eddington... In the end, did they not think that science could not explain the mysteries of the universe and desperately support God? Hasn't the so-called "art for art" theory become the entity of "art for money"? These are all obvious examples.</p>
<p>However, conversely, the ability of a subject to exist independently must have its own characteristics, its own content and form. Therefore, no matter what subject the researcher is, in addition to having general social science knowledge and basic philosophical knowledge, they should also strive to study the subject they are studying and specialize in it. Because human knowledge has developed to the present, every academic department has complex materials that must be studied, and has rich content. If you do not specialize in research, the result will not be to deepen your research. We can say that no matter how great a social scientist or philosopher is, if he does not have a considerable long-term study of natural science or literature and art, and does not have specialized knowledge of natural science or literature and art, then he cannot talk about natural science or literature and art. Even if he wants to talk about it, the result will only be a big joke, and he will not get anything!</p>

<h3 id="e306">Stage Design <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Fan</p>
<p>In order to enhance the divinity of the drama, the stage design must first be considered; because the size, depth, and angle of the stage, as well as its suitability for a change in the plot and its power to emphasize it, are the basic conditions for the success of a drama.</p>
<p>Since the stage has such an interconnected relationship with the drama, we cannot arbitrarily ignore the skills of stage design. Now let's first talk about the effect of stage design on helping actors, and how it has an inseparable connection with the audience's line of sight.</p>
<p>Stage design is based half on the construction of architecture and half on the axes built on the drama itself.</p>
<p>In the theater or in real life, no matter when, once a scene has an object, there is such an effort; to keep the eyes on a line that is perpendicular to the line of action. In a dialogue between two or more people, or when something moves from one side to the other, or in a revolving scene, such as a military parade or a competition, the most convenient thing for observation is to provide the audience with a line of sight that is at right angles to the line of action. The theater for the audience in this imagined state is arranged axially. The more fully the action can conform to this requirement, that is, to obtain the position that is perpendicular to the line of sight of the imagined audience, the more balanced the center of gravity of the action between the collaborators (two) becomes. If the axis of the performance forms any other angle, or is parallel to it, the dramatic effect of the element facing the audience will increase, otherwise it will decrease: if the actor enters from the rear or the rear steps, his effect will be greater than that of his companion who is facing away from the audience.</p>
<p>Speaking of stage design, it has undergone many changes in history. In ancient China, a drama group did not pay attention to the stage department: even in modern times, stage design was still influenced by Europe.</p>
<p>The original European stage only used the law of that single vertical axis.</p>
<p>In later Greek theaters, in addition to the entrance and exit in the middle, there were also entrances and exits on the left and right sides of the rear; the design technique was like the stage of Chinese Peking Opera now. On the oldest Spanish stages, there seemed to be something different, with only side entrances and exits, as if in the style of the ancient "comedy school." When the number of left and right entrances and exits increases, and at the same time the central axis increases, this law is very effective. This is the law of a single stage coordinate, which originated in Italy in the 16th century, and later gradually became popular throughout Europe, and the United Kingdom also imitated it at the same time; the current stage design of Chinese Peking Opera is probably derived from this Italian law?</p>
<p>The earliest decorative expression of the axis of the drama is the door; the door designated for actors to enter and exit was a decorative symbol in the Middle Ages. Later, it gradually became more beautiful, and then there was the setting of scenery; the scenic theater had some doors along the central axis of the theater or perpendicular to it, leading the audience's line of sight to those doors, the area of ​​the stage performance. Therefore, in principle, there is no difference between the medieval theater and the "humanist" theater for those axes.</p>
<p>Those actual entrances and exits along the line of the side curtains obviously correspond to some entrances and exits that were built from the left and right of the house in the scenic theater; the construction of the theater here is just an enclosed space, which is consistent with the principle of the drama.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a fact; the depth of the stage has gradually shrunk since the eighteenth century, allowing for a second life mark, a wide coordinate of action; this improvement not only helped the successful effect of the drama, but also saved a lot of space.</p>
<p>In our law of dealing with stage design according to a certain axis of the drama, the deep stage only provides some side entrances and exits, and its position is at right angles to the central axis of the building. In this way, the side curtain is regarded as a particularly important element in the design.</p>
<p>Stage design is a clever organization of a given space, built on a virtual given axis, that is, the line of sight of the imagined audience; if the development of that technology fully allows the space to be used in all aspects, and all of the space is completely used to serve the drama, then the material of the stage design 丨 the stage itself 丨 will be more harmonious with the drama.</p>
<p>The current Chinese stage does not seem to have any improvements; even if there are some improvements, it is only that the technique of changing scenery is more agile. This refers to the skills of Peking Opera stage design. As for spoken dramas, it is difficult to judge because of the different environmental relations; because China currently does not have a fixed stage for performing spoken dramas, the design is only a temporary arrangement suitable for the drama to be performed, and it is not possible to talk about a truly complete design for a while!</p>

<p>— Luo Lun</p>
<p>Portland, USA Correspondence</p>
<p>Americans all have the addiction of three W's: wine and women are especially important. Because of this, and in that environment, the United States has produced many prostitutes.丨丨 Although I am not an old moralist, I seem to believe what a Chinese worker said:</p>
<p>"Except for women who have not yet developed, there is almost no virgin in the United States!"</p>
<p>The women of rich families are too romantic, and the environment makes them know how to fall in love as soon as they develop. Yes, the first love of women who have just developed is willing to dedicate their hymen to men: the women of poor families, either are raped, or are willing to prostitute themselves for the sake of life, or they work during the day, and at night they are "street women." Every port's Broadway Road is full of wine and women, and this place is the same.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday, and I got a rest, so I followed my companion into a low-class theater, 丨丨 I still use Chicago's words to criticize it, but in fact this place can be said to be middle-class. The film being shown seems to be something like Garbo's —— these female stars seem to be out of date. I came here just to rest and relieve the boring life. There, you will find a dilapidated arrangement, the chairs are old, the walls are leaning, but it is full of people, many women are mixed in the middle of men.</p>
<p>I saw several Chinese workers I knew, they were all carrying low-class "street women" such as black women to watch the show.</p>
<p>In our front row there were some women who had not yet found men. When the lights were still on, they all looked at us, and I was afraid of them, because these women would arbitrarily talk to you to seduce you. I was going to change seats, but the whole theater was full.</p>
<p>The lights went out, and in my imagination, an older American woman, who was about thirty years old, turned her head and teased me:</p>
<p>"Aren't you too lonely?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>I felt her hand move to my back. At the same time, I also found another woman telling jokes to my companion, 丨丨 he is older than me, so he is happy to talk to them. After a long time, the woman turned around again:</p>
<p>"Can I sit next to you?"</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter, but there are no seats?"</p>
<p>It was full of people. She said this too unsmartly, so she didn't say it again. 丨丨 I saw her ugly face covered with powder and rouge looking around in the dim light.</p>
<p>"You're coming to my house tonight!"</p>
<p>Suddenly I heard my companion's "opponent" begging him like this. I was really afraid that he would lose his footing, so I twisted his thigh with my hand. In this uneasy disturbance, we finally managed to spend two hours, and we all got up to leave. Who knew that those American women were all following us closely, and even approached us, just like a couple. They all asked for our hands to be held with their attitude, but this was impossible. She took my hand, put it close to my face, and said sweetly:</p>
<p>"Come to my house and sit for a while, Chinese!"</p>
<p>"No, I have to go to work!"</p>
<p>All the way to the door, I took off her hand, and so did my companion, and we got rid of these disturbances. We came to the center of Broadway Road, and couldn't help laughing at the same time. I haven't encountered these things in Chicago, those women only seduce you with their eyes, and they leave if they can't seduce you; I also encountered it once in de Cai, at that time in a bar, 丨丨 this is not surprising.</p>
<p>The lights of Broadway are gradually dimming. There are no cars after twelve o'clock. The past prosperity, only God knows its mystery; today's decline, but it is a human affair!</p>

<h3 id="e310">Opening Up Wasteland <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Sha</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence</p>
<p>In recent years, natural disasters and man-made disasters have ravaged the countryside, making it lifeless. The farmers, who are inherently conservative, cannot but run around for food and clothing and migrate in all directions. Our Anhui is a relatively barren province compared to the prosperous Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces; especially northern Anhui, which has been in famine for years, and the farmers are "not guaranteed in the morning and evening"; even the more fertile central and southern Anhui, the farmers have also been in deep water and fire in recent years. The great flood of 1931 washed away all their belongings, and the harvest disaster of last year almost made them busy for a whole year in vain. The great drought of this year is even more making them unable to live or die.</p>
<p>But people always have to live on, and there are always ways to live. Even disasters can sometimes help the poor. For example, floods can indeed fill millions of acres of fertile land, but they can also create a lot of arable wasteland. The "opening up wasteland" can also support a part of the common people. This kind of "opening up wasteland" has been popular in various counties near Anqing in recent years.</p>
<p>The causes of wasteland are roughly like this: Mountain farmers in the upper reaches, in order to avoid freezing and starvation, must try every means to harvest a little more grain to survive; so the wilderness and remote places such as the mountainside, hills, mountainside, and foothills, which were originally covered with firewood and weeds, are also planted with miscellaneous grains such as corn, sorghum, mountain potatoes, mung beans, peanuts, and sesame. The sand and soil in the mountains are all loosened, and when it rains heavily, the sand, mud, and slurry will rush down like waterfalls, and this torrent will also wash away huge amounts of sand and mud from the river bank with great force, and bring them all to the downstream. The result is naturally very unfortunate, filling many fertile lands of the farmers, the riverbed is silted up, and sometimes even the entire swamp and small lakes are filled up. In recent years, a small lake in the western countryside of Anqing has been filled up. Some large lakes are also getting smaller day by day. The riverbed is also in this situation. The famous Wan River, which originates from the Ershishan Mountains, has long become silted up and unbearable in the past ten years. Even the smallest boat is difficult to travel smoothly by the end of autumn and the beginning of winter. However, a lot of "sandbars" have grown on both sides of the river. These "sandbars" are getting bigger and bigger every year, while the bottom and body of the river are getting lower and narrower. The farmers' fertile land is gone, and their eyes naturally turn to this "God-given"</p>
