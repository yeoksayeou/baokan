<h3 id="c37">第三次海軍軍縮會議之展望　敬 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>在倫敦海軍條約行將滿期之今日。太平洋上風雲初不因日本外交之運用而趨於緩和。如美國進行亞留仙羣島之空防建設。羅斯福總統定於今年夏季巡視夏威夷日本假僞滿名義而添造軍艦。英國爲新嘉坡要塞而大興土木莫不爲備戰之前聲惟英美日三國之經濟狀况均不見佳。其一般民衆。且以軍費增加而愈見貧乏。各國當局在此矛盾情勢下。對於軍備限制之舉。尙不敢棄之若遺耳。</p>
<p>在此次英國發起海軍軍縮預備會議之前。原看　美英間先圖諒解之風傳。嗣聞英國不欲開罪日本。决邀日法意三國共同參加。東京方面消息。且曰英國請書之內容。業經聲明。會議席上當專就海軍問題。爲個别之交涉。此言而確。則所謂海軍預備會議之發起。殆無異爲日本所授意。僅由倫敦政府出面</p>
<p>而已不知凡稍諳國際現勢者。皆知遠東政治問題與海軍比率問題實含有不可分離之連帶關係。日方宣傳之不足輕信。固可不辯而自明也。</p>
<p>吾人姑舍此點不論。而僅就海軍軍縮之技術問題言之。（一）英國曾有提議。主張將主力艦之最高噸位由四萬噸减至二萬五千噸。同時希望在小型巡洋艦方面。英國爲他國之先導無奈美政府對於此議。絶難贊同。卽英之舊同盟國日本。亦必不肯輕易允諾。蓋英國屬地遍天下。軍港要塞之位置。亦稱適中。無論上煤下水。給糧給油皆異常便利。主力艦噸位之减削足使小型戰艦之數量增多。爲英人計。不惟减輕負担。且足增加實力。且世界利用汽力及內燃機之船舶屬於英國者幾占三分之。一。總計二千二百餘萬噸之鉅。一旦發生戰事將商船改爲六吋及六吋以下砲徑之巡洋艦亦並不費力。然則英國此種主張。純出於自利之動機。固無疑也。惟美國之地位則不然。美國欲保持其太平洋與大西洋之孔道阿拉斯加夏威夷以至巴拿馬運河三要塞之防綫非艦型大噸位高絶不足以發揮海軍效能而維持其軍事上之優勢至於日本國土狹小。屬地接近。其貼鄰之中俄兩國海軍。力復不足與之爭雄長。若根據互不攻擊之軍縮根本原則。主力艦噸位减輕。不惟可以節省經費。且可避免英美長距離之襲擊似爲有利之舉惟日本方將有事於太平洋。不但欲與美國爭覇。且亦念念不忘澳洲與南洋。故其附和美國以爲主力艦不可全廢者。實因别有所圖耳。</p>
<p>（二）其次則爲潛艇性質問題英美日三國又各有不同之懷抱英美二國之海軍。並不十分倚重於潛艇惟日本則以爲此乃防禦的武器。不能加以撤廢預料在未來會議中。日本當再以「充分於防守而不充分於攻擊」的海軍力爲標榜要求容許各國保有自國最以爲適當之軍艦其意蓋欲恃潛艇爲進攻之武器。在太平洋印度洋中大肆活動。以威脅英美海軍之進逼也。　　（三）日本所最畏欋者。厥爲空軍之襲擊惟各國陸上空軍根據地。除海參崴外。皆距日本較遠。其空襲之威脅。並不甚强。惟海上航空母艦則不然。航空母艦之行動旣速。又能運用自如。日本戒懼最深。故反對亦最力。大角海相早有特别提出廢棄航空母艦議案之表示。可知其態度之堅决。英美究將如何應付。雖尙難作具體之判斷然就一般形勢作常識的推測。恐未必即肯輕於承認。以自行削弱其武力也。</p>
<p>（四）最後猶須注意者係軍事根據地問題。美國旣已允許菲列濱羣島獨立。島上之軍事設。備。自必逐步放鬆日本乃乘機表示。不但菲列濱關島之要塞應加限制。卽夏威夷之軍事建築。新嘉坡之軍港設備。亦不應獨居於例外。或者推測。日本將要挾英美放棄在太平洋各島嶼及新嘉坡之海軍根據地與一切軍事設備。以爲海軍比率交換條件之一。不無可信。</p>
<p>由此種種。足見在今茲之預備會議席上。關於三國海軍軍備之技術問題。甚少可以調和之餘地。若進而涉及政治問題。自將益滋糾紛無疑。預備會議前途之暗礁已若是其多。則正式會議之不易成功。更可思過半矣。</p>

<p>各國軍備競爭的新趨勢</p>
<p>蘇聯化學戰備異軍突起</p>
<p>歐洲暗雲迷漫、到處者有引起戰禍的可能、不過目前所以未曾發生意外禍變的原因、幷不是當事各國不想借此淸算舊賬、恢復衰疲的經濟力、打破現狀、祇因都受着國內的限制、在經濟上的恐慌還不曾渡過、在人事上反戰的思想仍舊相當的有力、加以各國自身都没有必勝的把握、所以這時候、没有一個國家敢輕於出來挑戰、</p>
<p>歐洲的僵局就在這種混沌局面中註定了、英國處自不必斤斤於爭奪着要確執歐洲大陸的牛耳、但她却不能不過問歐洲的事、對於世界各地商塲的牽制、更不能隨便放過、現在海軍和陸軍的支配、似乎都成過去了、縱然還各自據有其地位、但重要性確已漸見减退、新興的武力！！空軍漸在爲軍事上的重點、英國於此當然絕不肯落後、現在英國的空軍實力、在她本國飛行隊總數有七十五個中隊、在海外的有二十三個中隊、其中戰鬥機有十三中隊、陸海軍恊同組織的有十個隊、輕爆擊飛機有三十四中隊、重爆擊機十個中隊、通信飛行機一個中隊、飛行艇七個中隊、凡是編入中隊的飛行機總數約計一千五百架、其費用據一九三三年度的預算爲一千九百六十三萬八千六百鎊、航空人員、將校有三千一百五十人、下士以下的兵員有二萬五千零四十二人、幷且鑑於當前歐洲形勢的緊張、遠東空氣的惡劣、還不能不有更進一步的打算、所以英國本國航空機的中隊數要擴張到八十九中隊、人員要擴張到四萬人、飛行機數目要增加到二千零七十二架、</p>
<p>英國尙且如此注重飛行隊的擴張、以空軍號稱世界第一的法蘭西、當然更不肯讓人了、她的空軍（除了少數的海軍航空隊之外）計有驅逐機三十五中隊、偵察觀測機四十六中隊、輕爆擊機九中隊、重爆擊機十八中隊、掩護機兩中隊、總計有一百十個中隊、此外還有十八個氣球中隊、及二十四個中隊的海外部隊、飛機數目約有三千、一九三三年度的預算爲十六萬萬九千零四十一萬三千法郎、人員將校有二千零九十人、下士以下兵員有三萬零四百一十二人、將來她要擴充成二百十個中隊、增加到五千九百架飛機、次於法蘭西的歐洲勢力丨丨意大利要和她在地中海爭覇、要在中歐取得制覇的地位、所以意國也在擴大其空軍、她現有的實力是、戰鬥飛機三十六中隊、偵察機二十八中隊、爆擊機三十一中隊、練習機十四中隊、機種不明的十四中隊、計有一百二十三個中隊、此外還有兩個氣球中隊、與陸軍恊同組織的空軍有四個聯隊殖民地空軍力量在外、其飛機數目約有一千五百架、一九三三丨丨三四年的預算有六萬萬九千五百九十四萬八千里拉、其空軍人員、將校有二千四百三十七人、下士有四千零八十八人、兵卒有二萬五千零二十九人、其擴張計劃還没有找到</p>
<p>具體的數字、</p>
<p>蘇聯是一個世界上神秘的國家、特别是軍事組織、從來不公開發表的、不過她的五年計劃、第一次相當成功之後、大家都曉得那是包含得有極其嚴重的軍事意味、在今年一月間、據某專門家的推算、蘇聯的空軍、驅逐機有四十六中隊、偵察機八十七中隊、爆擊機四十六中隊、攻擊機及其他三十一中隊、計二百十個中隊、此外還有十三個氣球中隊、三十二個海軍飛機中隊、總計所有飛機數約三千架、她的化學戰備、尤足顯其空軍的特色、</p>
<p>歐洲主要各國對於空軍整備是這樣的努力、則所謂軍備縮小也者、誰都知道那是外交的應酬而巳、（四月二十五日於倫敦）</p>
<h3 id="c104">日本政黨合作的前奏　日本通信 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>（議會政治的回光反照）</p>
<p>（軍閥專制的惟一象徵）</p>
<p>日本的立憲政治、自從軍部挑動九·一八事變、激刺其一般國民熱感以後、議院的座談、非但自身毫無氣力、卽軍部也不甚重視、於多數人民更覺着厭倦了、例如政友會擁有三百頭絕对多數的議席、竟至不能依法取得政權、甚至其領袖被現役軍殺死、事隔一年半以後、纔有人敢公然提出質問、由此可以充分證明議會的無能、更證明以財閥不背景的政黨、不得多數人民的信任、</p>
<p>日本議會政治、所以到現在還能維持的原因、在政治上講、是日本幷没有完全脫離封建關係、所以她的元老、在政治行行動、依舊有相當巨大的力量、如西園寺公望雖不是和山縣有朋一樣在軍部方面有實力、但在政治方面、却有其特殊地位、他極力主張立憲政治、以爲議會無論如何是需要的、所以現狀就可以暫由齋藤維持、議會的形式、也可以存在、再則日本軍閥、無論怎樣橫暴、少壯軍人、無論怎樣不滿、也祗是对現政府（换一句話說是对內閣）當政的人不滿而巳、於整個制度幷没有疑問、那末、祗要現制度保存、由資本家支持的議會政治總還是會有存留的餘地、何况理財還是要靠他們呢、</p>
<p>財閥和軍閥的鬬爭、在今年春初、差不多已經短兵相接、最初是軍部步步後退、到後來就借綱紀問題反攻、結果、把政黨打得落花流水、現在軍部在軍事上又有了較堅固而有力的新佈置、這種佈置幷不弱於九·一八事件、不過在什麽時機發動、借什麽事情發動現在還不易斷定而巳、因此財閥在相形之下、就更見落後了、財閥和擁護議會的人、這纔想將政友會和民政黨二者聯合起來、摒除黨見的爭執與私人感情的衝突、而從事所謂政策的調和、表面上、他們都說到日本退出國聯後、國際間大有孤立之勢、同時國際間經濟鬬爭、丨通商的对日壓迫、而事實上日本國內的經濟生活、雖因軍需工業的刺激呈活潑景象、但得到好處的人、祗是少數中的少數、一般人還是呻吟於不景氣局面之下、生活異常困難、如前任　太長官平岡定太郎、竟至於因生活無着而以僞造明治天皇御筆書寫來騙錢、中流以下的苦况、就可以推知了、在這樣生活狂流激盪之中、最使日本統治者（無論是軍閥是財閥）危懼的是思想惡化、在從前言論比較自由的時代、總還有一班人趨向於合法運動、現在表面上雖然不甚看得見大的惡化痕跡、但是在實際狀態、反動的組織、却發展得非常之快、無論在都巿的產業工人與在學中的學生、在鄕村中的佃農和雇農、都有極其濃厚的惡化行爲、卽是右傾的所謂各種愛國團體、固然是頑固守舊的、可是要打破現狀、則同是一樣的、幷且往往用暴烈手段、於是財政資本家爲自己的死活關係、一方面帮助軍閥高倡其非常時的論調、同時要設法鞏固他們正己的地位、維持議會存在是最重要的一着、所以政·民·兩黨恊商、特别注意到米榖問題、與思想敎育問題上、</p>
<p>政·民·兩黨恊作的初步、在技術上、（一）會議時、兩黨輪流爲主席、（二）會議時期和地點、由兩黨負責人商酌决定以後、通逹主席、由主席通知出席代表、（三）會議內容、經雙方會商之後認爲可以發表的、纔公開發表、（四）兩黨的幹事長、卽爲此會議的負責人、</p>
<p>這是他們認爲最有力最能克服當前予盾的妙法、也是西園寺到東京後、主張維持立憲政治的結果、不過這種運動、是否能濟政治的結果、不過這種運動、是否能勢、大是疑問、至於幾個大財閥如三井、三菱·古河·等要乘此在日本國內擴張其獨占、自屬可能、卽推而延長到東北四省、也都有相當把握、但是這些方法、决不能救日本之急、要再向海外開拓、就會碰璧了、講到在議會裏以多數制勝、要運用議員以制服軍閥、那簡直是等於作夢、因爲政友會早就有了絕对多數議席在那裏、總之、今後日本政局的推移、無論是外交是軍事、更要以軍閥爲主體、財閥最多也不過是大一點的附庸而巳、所以軍部的陰謀、是該特别加以考察、由軍部的行動以窺測日本政局的動向、（五月二十三日於東京）</p>

<p>其一、爲中藏問題、就沿革論之、中藏關、係、始於唐初文成公主下嫁、終唐之世、爲西藏全盛時代、而中藏蓋爲甥舅之國、宋代朝貢恭順、臣服無貳、元代特崇番僧、而郡縣其地、明善覊糜、錫以法王國師之尊號、而許其世襲、故終明之世、無西番患、迄於淸室、康乾雍等朝、对藏恩威並濟、至爲恊洽、故西藏領土、主權自始屬我、證諸史實、彰彰甚明、就糾紛言之、自淸乾隆二十一年英國囊括印度、華倫哈丁、遂柏傑入藏、至嘉慶十五年、遣馬寗入藏之間窺藏之使、不絕於途、遂伏中藏問題之根株、後此日益演變、乃有今日之一切懸案、光緖二十八年、淸庭且有與俄締結西藏密約之舉、計自英人侵藏、與我發生交涉、見諸條約者、實始於淸光緖二年之「芝罘條約」、次爲光緒十二年之「中英緬甸條約」、次爲光緖十六年之「印藏條約」、次爲光緖十九年之「加爾各逹印藏條約」、次爲光緖三十三年唐紹儀與英使薩道締結之「藏印續約」、（光緖三十年「英藏和約」卽附於此約內）、而光緖三十三年之「英俄恊約」內、亦有關於西藏之規定、民國以來、則有民元英使朱爾典之抗議、及我之答辯書、民二則有英俄操縱之下「蒙藏條約」、而極重大之西姆拉會議、亦於是年開始、至民三二月、英忽創提劃分內外藏之新議、四月會議結束、陳貽範擅簽草約、五月一日、政府通電拒絕之、西姆拉會議、遂告破裂、此後復經四次交涉、一爲民四袁氏醞釀帝制時代、二爲民六对德宣單之際、三爲民七陳遐齡所結之「絨壩岔休戰和約」、爲一年期限、故民八五月、英使催議甚迫、卽因認陳約期屆故也、四爲華會之九國公約、尊重中國主權、破除在中國之特殊地域之規定、實於英对西藏政策、極端衝突、惟其實效、直等於零耳、民二十大白事件、幸賴中央威德將士用命、驅藏軍於金沙江西岸、訂「崗拖和約」、是殆中藏間最近之條約也、綜觀中藏問題、其經過至爲繁複、約可别爲不同之範圍、甲·爲对外的、凡涉於英·印·俄·蒙藏者屬之、最近或將牽入日滿兩方、亦未可知、乙·爲國內的、凡關於康藏·靑藏·滇藏者屬之、惟此兩項、亦有互相影響及牽涉之處、然其主要點、實各不同、質言之、屬於甲項者、欲求解决、其當事者、不僅中藏兩造、而所含問題異常繁重、屬於乙項者、實以康藏糾紛爲中心、且據現狀觀之、上賴中央之主持、下恃隣省之合作、無論取何種方式、似不難獲相當結果、商决之後、進而謀甲項之交涉、據個人管見、或且較爲順利、</p>

<p>讀書消息　申報流通圖書館讀書指導部編</p>
<p>目錄（一）寄參加讀書会者　　　（二）希望讀者注意的</p>
<h3 id="c192">寄參加讀書会者 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>大家熱烈期待着的讀書会、到今日　未正式誕生，這不獨引起了大家的焦急，就連我們自己了不能不引爲慚愧的。遲遲的難產，部也有它的緣由。我們總覺得舉辦一件新的工作，開始萬不能疎忽，應有詳盡的計劃，適當的籌備。現在在大體上一切都辦停當了，祇候靑年会决定大会期，就可揭幕了。關於我們籌備的經過及希望讀者在參加前做點應有的凖備，我們應該對讀者作出下面的報告。</p>
<h3 id="c193">（籌備經過） <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>自從第五期讀書消息登過舉辦讀書会消息之後、我們無日不在籌備之中，經過詳情也巳陸續公佈，這裏無須贅述。但本部所以與靑年会合作的一段姻緣，却得有告訴諸君的必要。先是本部决定舉辦讀書会之後、卽向靑睥会商借会塲，誰知事情巧極，靑年会自己也要辦讀書会，正想請本部合力主持。我們覺得大家旨趣旣然相同、合起來辦，豈不是更能集中人才，物力麽，於是便由大家商議，雙方結合成爲一體。事情决定之後。最近我們又開了幾次会，討論具體辦法，結果大家草擬了一個</p>
<h3 id="c194">（計劃草案） <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>本來我們想祇負召集之責，組織方法擬由第一次大会產生。後來覺得，大家初次討論，多無預備，組織方案恐怕很難具體確定，而最近又有許多報名者寄來提案和意見，因此，我們認爲倒不如把這些讀者的極可寳貴的意見，綜合起來，擬成草案，提交大会討論來得妥當。這個草案，共分八項，現在把它的要點，摘述如次：</p>
<p>關於讀書会的旨趣，共有四點：（一）用客觀的態度自由討論學術；（二）輔助文化凖較低的大衆；（三）研究學理不忘實際；（四）討論極端自由，但不作任何社会的活動·至於討論的方式，分初級班與高級班，初級班由程度相同的讀者，經大家同意，讀某一類書籍，成立讀書班，高級班則爲以理論與實踐配合爲原則，以指定讀物的內容擴大到實際問題的研究。參加諸君，務希早日</p>
<h3 id="c195">自己準備 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>依照自己的興趣，預定參加那一班研究並早日把自己所要研究的科目，所要讀「某一類書籍」開好寄給我們，使我們好預先彙集分類。諸君對於讀書会懐着很大的期望，那你在開会前千萬要自己預先凖備，使我們的讀書会很活躍的成立起來，唯有如此，它以後繼会蒸蒸日上，生氣勃勃。所以除了上列幾個最低限度的凖備外，還希望諸君多多考慮，（一）讀書会要採怎樣方法纔能逹到我們讀書的目的；（二）要怎樣纔可使集團的探討，勝於個人的研究。最近</p>
<h3 id="c196">（報名地點） <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>亦已决定。卽（一）八仙橋靑年会，（二）四川路靑年会，（三）本報圖書館。前二處手續恐還未弄好，諸君報名，請卽駕蜸本館閱覽室</p>
<p>簽名。再有許多</p>

<p>寫信來要求參加，這是事實上的限制，我們無法邀請他們到上海來，我們以後除在讀書消息上廣播我們的研究的報告以報答這些熱心的朋友外，只有表示萬分的同情與漸　了。</p>
<h3 id="c198">（希望讀者注意的） <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>希望讀者注意的事，有的屢次說過，但諸君有時還不注意，這裏再說一遍罷！</p>
<h3 id="c199">（不要懈怠） <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>以前我們曾說過，凡願參加本部研究者，如有兩月不與本部通信並未提出讀書報告者，本部得取消其登記。但現在有些讀者參加後，仍是犯着這個毛病，這種懈怠現象繼續下去，很有妨害我們的工作，所以我們實行以前的决定，對於興趣冷淡的讀者取消登記。將餘額歡迎新朋友，茲有十一位朋友，吳帆舟，李氷，東積，文莊重，陳璟，蕭家錚，朱繼明，范方，邵濟仁，潘如浩，朱柏延，丨久不來館領取登記證，取消登記。以外，並希望其他益登記諸君注意。</p>

<p>讀者呌我們介紹書籍和與我們質疑問難，過一次之後，有些讀者就不來信了。這是我們最失望的。因爲我們不知道他們對於我們的答覆是否滿意；我們介紹他讀的書是否讀過，讀了是否了解，這些是我們都必得知道的。</p>
<h3 id="c201">（介紹批評） <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>我們雖鎭日爲諸君找好書讀，但我們的見聞畢竟是有限的。諸君如有値得介紹的書籍，務請開出寄給我們，最好並把該書的優點簡單的指出，同樣，諸君如能把一本書的壞處盡量指出，也是一件功德無量的事，所以也請諸君報告我們，供我們的參考，並補救我們目力不及處，最近有位朱霞楓君來函把我們的「讀書問答集」排誤的地方，及他所懷疑之點，一一指出，我們一方面感謝他愛護我們的誠意，更欽佩他的讀書精神和求是態度。我們的出版物極望讀者能作極嚴厲的批評。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在中間另有兩根橫木梗着，一在前，一在後，它們的位置：正好介乎輿的本身和頭尾兩根橫木的中間，不過略長一二尺；四個頭上，也各有兩名轎夫抬着。所以合併算起來，一起便有十六名轎夫了。</p>
<p>鸞輿的外部是更光彩了！前後左右所用的，全是用金綫界就的薄綢，襯着裏面的黃緞，便格外的華貴富麗，無從形容。何况在四面又有四條藍色的飛龍繪着，這氣象便越發的雄壯燦爛了！轎頂的格式是完全照宮殿的式樣製的，一般也有翹起的飛簷，塗着金翠，閃閃生光。正中頂上，還安放着一個黃色的圓球，約模有一串葡萄那樣大小；這個球雖然是空的，却全是用純金製的。</p>
<p>還有一點我們必須認識，雖然這乘鸞輿的式樣難免太古一些，但是無論它的外部，內部，上部，下部，都是十分美觀的；人坐在裏面，也必然是非常舒適的！不過論到坐的話，那我可没有嘗試過。據我所知道，除却太后自己以外，只有李蓮英因爲負着淸潔和整理這鸞輿的責任，當太</p>
<p>后不在輿中的時候，可以走進裏頭去收拾；其他的人，誰也不敢伸腿跨進去一步，不要說乘坐了！就是那內裏幔着的黃緞上所繡的「八寳」的花樣，也祗有在太后所用的東西上，才可以引用。從我這麽一長篇話看起來，這座鸞輿的能在我們這列御用火車上獨佔一輛車子，實在不是一件奇怪的事情，也可以說是「理該如此」的了！（四五）</p>
<h3 id="c205">上海的乞丐 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>窮得没飯吃，當乞丐，這是天經地義的生活大綱。但在上海，當乞丐，可也不是輕易的。上海的乞丐，分門别類，各有派頭，各守門戶，不相侵犯。而在同一派類中的乞丐，却還各有地界，不容侵略的　。</p>
<p>熱閙馬路上的　把和乞丐，除了　行人，討布施之外，是不許作第二種討錢行徑的。而且所　的地段，除了甲馬路至乙馬路中間一段的某一面人行道之外，是不許越出範圍的。在蘇州河各橋上的拉車乞丐，也是如此。只許在某一橋的某一堍上活動。越出了範圍，挨着揍都不容回手的。至於在各里弄口倒包飯作送飯擔上剩飯的那些乞丐，規例更嚴，非但有地段，更有各丐固定的戶頭。</p>
<p>紅白帖子，也有地段，各不相侵。用赤裸的小孩，躺在地上向行人討錢的，也各有指定的地盤，南北巿不能亂走。惟有穿長衣，捧竹筒，而唱道情的，却不受地段的限制。</p>
<p>上述的各派乞丐，各有其領袖。每一</p>
<p>領袖，各有其無上的權威，有控制每一個「小脚色」的能力。領袖的生活，是很優裕的，有的竟像齊人般的妻妾俱備。這種生活的源泉，不用說得，是榨取着每一個乞丐的剩餘利潤。而乞丐的甘被領袖榨取，據說，不如此，是不能得到「工作」的。</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>這區域裏没有亮的街燈，祇有天空的大月亮貼着那支高烟囱，發出凄凉的光輝，星星的光是幽綠的，灰黯而不平坦的煤屑略攤開在陰森的雰圍中，半夜啦，獨個兒走着，前面是黑暗的，後成跟着的亦是黑暗。</p>
<p>，　　拐個灣兒，依舊是籬笆，破牆，廠屋，崎嶇的煤屑路，高烟囱裏的烟橫仍過去，透過月光，頓蒙了層黑紗似地，更黯淡啦，心兒　裏溢着沉鬰。遠遠的有顆紅星星熌爍着，走前去幾步，不是星星，却是盞燈，掛在一家的屋簷下，我奇怪，那人家半夜裏還没熄門燈。</p>
<p>走近那盞燈的時候，便給午夜的風傳來一種慘號，像謀財害命時那被害人駭極痛極求救的呼聲，多麽悽厲呵，呌人的毛髮竪起來，汗毛孔滲出冷汗，我走在屠作門前，我不敢正眼兒瞧一瞧那門裏…………。</p>
<p>悽厲的呌號不斷的打門廟透出來、眼前恍惚的把挻亮的尖刀，有桶鮮紅的熱血，有張屠夫的兇臉，我身子顫慄了，我有點受不起午夜的風陣陣吹刮，我再不忍聽那生死關頭丨殺那痱的哀鳴，放快了步子，逃犯似的地向前走去，前面是黑暗的，後面跟着的亦是黑暗。</p>
<p>這區域裏没有亮的街燈。</p>
<h3 id="c207">農邨破產的寫照 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 保之</p>
<p>生長在都巿裏的人們，祇聽到農邨的經濟破產，却不知道農邨經濟破產的原因，簡單的來說說，一方面受着帝國主義的經濟侵略，重重剥削，已經是着實可怕，一方面民族資本的逐步破產，國貨的不容易暢銷，那末直接間接地農邨也必然受到了摧殘，還加着國內頻年的戰亂，天災的時作，已經弄得種田人抬頭不起，何况還有一般豪紳地主，勒逼地租，高利重貸，都在加緊剝削，加緊摧殘，農民處在幾生壓榨之下，試問還有超生之日嗎，卽使偶爾年榖豐登，而一班奸商又要乘勢壟斷抑價，結果辛苦一年，非但等於白耕白種，連自己的地皮財物也剝削一空了。</p>
<p>這全是農邨破產的　結，現在巳經明星公司的導演李萍倩君根據了這些材料，攝成了一部「黃金榖」的電影，可以在銀幕上把它暴露出來，使每個人都可以看到農邨究竟爲什麽破產的。</p>
<p>此刻「黃金榖」就要在本埠的新光大戲院公映了。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十九回國　回柬足傷心自標獨活　聽　同歃血共誓精忠　　積之向甘太太鞠了一個躬笑道：得拉，我劉謝謝你。我對你實說罷了，我現在想明的了，我不够交朋友的資格更談不到結婚，我在守獨身主義了。甘太太聽了這話，不由噗嗤一笑道：你趁早别提這個，提起來，那會讓人笑掉牙。實對你說，我從前也是守獨身主義的，於今作太太可多年了。男子們對於女子，更是見一個愛一個，你想這話說得上嗎？積之昻了頭笑道，嫂嫂，你往後瞧罷。他說到這裏，也不肯多談，自回屋子去了。心裏想着像楊桂枝這樣的女子。都有些靠不住，何况其他？我若至少不能做一個科長職分的官，這一輩子就不必想和女子接近了。背了兩手，連連在屋了裏來回的踱着，最後，由押屜裏抽出一疊紙來，就站在桌子頭邊，提起筆來，接連寫了好幾張標語，上面寫着是：最自由的是獨身主義，最高尙的是獨身主義，我只喜歡我一個人獨活在字宙裏。像這一類的言語，都是誇贊個人生活的意味的，自己寫了還不算，還要在屋子裏墻上張貼起來。自己站在屋子中間，均貼的標語，念着搖起頭來，好像很是得意似的。不用說，他這番牢騷，完全由於楊桂枝那封信而起。可是在喜峯口外面，三十里路遠的平安寨裏，也在張貼標語了。張貼標語的，不是别人，正是楊桂枝的丈夫趙自强。他那標語，倒也是和甘積之表示同調，乃是敵人在前面，别回頭看着家裏。那正也是不須要愛情的意思，但是他可是不着公事了。墻上高高的貼了這樣一張標語。（三九五）</p>

<h3 id="c210">花塢紀幽 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>淡淡的斜陽，散照着我們身上在輕風裏飄拂的白衫，離黃昏時候也不遠多少了。拖着藤杖從西溪看罷蘆花回來，沿秦亭山東去，到了一個破內的路亭名字喚作「開化」的。石瓢和尙堅决地慫恿我們折入花塢，去聽一聽幽壑的泉聲，和靜的梵唱。</p>
<p>早就看過錢唐陳　庵的西溪雜詠，他歌頌花塢的詩，這時跳進了記憶裏，一邊跟石瓢走，一邊不出聲的默誦着：</p>
<p>山深村隖多，此聞更深曲，春風一以至，如入萬花谷。夕陽到地遲，花外衆峯綠。</p>
<p>到眼便是深翠的松柏和蓊鬱的竹林，遠處近處，全是凉蔭，只一條曲折的磚路，像灰白的銀蛇似的，越上越細，越細也越模糊了。左右四面，便是法華山的屏嶂。把樹木的濃綠，封鎖了整個的花塢，單是竹柏疏處，可以仰頭瞧見一兩點碧天，似有似無的雲影。這裏連樵夫的足跡也没有，我們幾個人靜悄悄地走着，倒是脚底下忽左忽右被積葉罨没着的小澗裏，洩出琴弦似的淸響，着實使人的骨髓舒暢了一下子。</p>
<p>也有地方高天會寫進眼來，飛鳥輕靈地一瞥，那微紅的晚霞，水虹似的流向我們的衫子，每人身上浮盪着明艷的薄紅。而且斜陽側向西天，偷偷地穿過綠林，把木葉也煊成紫羅蘭的顔色，被襯在林子裏的一簇白牆的茅篷，或是修道女的黃牆的觀宇，更添了一層幽森凉寂的情調。</p>
<p>深山裏的黃昏的生活，正無異於坐在月夜大森林中聽自己的呼吸那麽沉靜。幾乎澗泉也要凝凍起來。偶然從遠處飛來了一聲矇隴的寺鐘，近處的鐘也繼續響了，只辦不出是那一個茅篷的鐘，因爲所有茅篷全躱在瞧不見的深坳裏。這時候，蒼茫的暮天狹逕之間，聞到了炊烟的氣息，看到了蜃霧似的山烟，梵唱也次第響喨了。</p>
<p>不知憧憬在深沉的夢幻裏，一日氣儘向法華山尖跑，終於花塢在夕陽裏的那一番啞默的畫圖，被我體味到了。當山巓的一座埋葬於金色陽光中的别　，傳出了一聲狗吠，猛然抬頭一瞧，就見到白底黑字的三個大字：「白雲堆」。　　「到了！上去借宿去。」我眞想學一學淮南王的雞犬，在銀璜裏做一個空桑之夢。但石瓢立刻說：白雲堆裏的主人，老住在杭州城裏，不輕易對這兒來享一點非人間的淸福，屋子空着，並没有食宿的供給的。被他這樣一說，上山來的那一股高興，就化成烟絲，恨不得從山巓上一跳跳到開化古亭，搭西溪來的汽車回湖濱去。爲什麽空着房屋不給自己住，同時又拒絕了别人？</p>
<p>看看天色眞的夜了，雖然夜在山裏另是一番奇境；但當我們没有帶電筒，天上又没有月的晚上，每一個人摸索下山來，要不跌仆也不成功了。</p>

<p>我國總代表王正廷　博士、昨對各報記者談話云、此次日本勾結菲律賓、以少數會員、非法解散此有二十餘年歷史之遠東運動會、我國絕不能承認、菲日之欲脫離退出遠運會、爲其範圍內之自已權利、我國不能干涉、若欲欲憑二國之通過、而解散遠運、其權力不知從何而來、實屬荒謬、遠運會之能否恢復與保存、及菲律賓態度之能否挽回與改變、皆在可能與不可能之間、余（王氏自稱）在離菲前、曾與菲參議院長奎松、作一度談話、奎松尙抱病未愈、對於是非曲直、十分明瞭、對於菲體恊行動、頗抱遺憾與懊悔、遠運前途之發展如何、尙在接洽之中、王氏昨在海關碼頭、亦對各報社記者談話云、遠東運動會爲世界運動會之一部分、我國又爲世運會之一員、故决將此事提請世界亞林西克大會解决之、縱不得直、亦當另想辦法、惟召開下屆大會、尙須歷時四載、在此期中、人事變遷如何、國際形勢之變遷又若何、均非能逆料、試觀一九一四年之德國與一九一八年之德國、其四年中之變遷如何、此卽一前鑑、我國與菲列賓邦交素極友好、此次菲乃受日愚、致有此舉、事後菲人亦悔恨不止、我國對下屆大會仍以主持國之責任、努力籌備、邀請各會員國參加、我知荷印菲列賓等、當能參加、如日本不願則聽之而已云、</p>

<p>略謂此次出席遠運、明知有不少困難、除運動之本身外、並有政治上之困難、蓋日本在開會前、卽提議僞組織參加事、當時日本曾派山本來我國、並赴菲島運動、我方嚴斥其非、菲方亦以章程規定、未予同意、故在上海舉行圓桌會議、卒遭否决、但日方並不干休、故於五月十九日起、在菲舉行代表會議時、日方竟首先提修改會章第三條、而根據第十四條出席會員三分之二投票之規定、要求付諸表产、但我申明非一致表决、不能變更章程、至第三次會議時、菲方明知變更章程、不能逹到對第三條亦不加修改、乃改而變更第十條、在其第一欵「遠東運動會競賽、須本會會員業餘運動員方可參加」原文下、加「或特許被邀參加」等字樣、我代表當質問「何人有權邀請」、日代表語塞、默然良久、但仍堅請付表决、我方卽申明如提表决、卽退出會議、如此則大會之法定人數人不足、然主席不加考慮、遽提表决、我代表卽退席、惟我代表係退出會議、並非退出大會、故對日菲兩國之非法解散、絕不承認、而在我退</p>
<p>出後、日菲更私自會議兩次、决議解散遠東運動會、而組織所謂東亞業餘運動會、我方當卽提出抗議、交本屆主席菲議長奎松、渠對此事、亦表不滿、允從長計議、故此事我在法律點上、論據</p>
<p>甚爲鞏固、惟將來發展至若何程度、尙未能逆料、將來進行之情形若何、當續爲報告云、</p>
<h3 id="c223">（體恊會之態度） <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>王氏繼續發表全國體育恊進會之態度、謂我國與菲島發起組織、已有二十餘年歷史之遠運會、果而有人破壞、其破壞之責任、自不在我、一旦爲人破壞、自應爭力、故如能保存之、則當竭力設法、退一步言、卽不能保存、亦不可惜、蓋我國提倡體育、當努力使这普遍、更須從幼童着手、以固其基礎、且須放遠目光、注意於世界、以我國人口之衆、努</p>
<p>力提倡、當能在世界運動會上佔一席地云、</p>
<h3 id="c224">（吳巿長演說辭） <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>繼由吳鐵城巿長致詞、略謂諸位選手代表、返國過滬、本擬設宴招待、以盡地主之誼、惟各地選手亟亟返籍未克如願、殊爲抱歉、明年全國運動大會在滬舉行、各位各省代表、當能出席、屆時再聚一地當再招待、繼謂國家存亡、民族盛衰、並非偶然、如能循理以行、必能强盛、我國因過去種種黑暗、至有當前莫大之困難、惟能渡過此難關、前途當光明無限、我國前途、繫於全國靑年、尤以在學之靑年學生蓋敎育爲社會之中心事業、學生活動亦爲社會之中心活動、靑年學生能上正軌、國家社會之事業當可蒸蒸日上之發展、末日王正廷領導三呼中華民國萬歲而散、</p>

<p>又據代表團中某君語記者、</p>
<p>此次菲當局爲日方所屈伏、接受其非法要求、而解散大會菲島人民、激烈反對、當地報紙均抨擊此種狂妄舉動、而馬尼剌日報、認日菲上此種行動、無異對我國表示「懦怯而無信、」卽菲體育界之多數職員、亦認此種舉動有辱國體、惟菲當局之出此、係以政治爲其主動、蓋菲島要求獨立、方爲美政府所承認、當菲議長奎松自美返國、途經日本時　或已與日默契、故菲報指摘當局、或早有成约之言、但日方之威脅、則甚露骨、日駐馬尼刺領事在某次宴會上、曾有「今日日本派選手一百七十餘人參與競賽、甚爲歡樂、如派兵艦一百七十餘艘來此則將作何感想、」及「菲卽將獨立、對鄰近之日本、當須維持</p>
<p>友好之感情」等演詞、菲當局之終爲要挾、甘心附和、某畏日之心理、可見一斑矣、</p>

<p>却克令勝孫道勝</p>
<p>鮑山利戰敗朱寬</p>
<p>第一屆全滬公開手球賽　單打中靑老將孫道勝對西靑冠軍却克令、二對一方分勝負、足見當時競賽之劇烈、却氏力猛善戰、右手底殺、一時無兩、孫氏好施巧計、專攻左方、逢隙卽殺、第一局却氏以二十一比十六勝、第二局孫氏反勝、比數二十一比十四、第三局之初、差數甚見接近、迨至十數之後、孫氏肌力不足、遂告失敗、却氏又以二十一比十三勝、尙有朱寬對鮑山利之單打、事出反常、朱寬竟然不幸以零對二受挫、技能經騐、鮑氏萬不及朱寬、或者適逢朱氏惡運當頭、</p>
<p>接連失手、觀其第一局二十一比二十三及十七比二十一、可以知矣、然而朱寬錦標希望、依然存在、但在手球房外秩序單上之註明、鮑山利一敗於克拉麥、後又以病棄權於羅台、而羅台離十屆遠運我國全體代表團合影（沈嗣良先生贈）</p>
<p>滬、於是遂成朱寬孫道勝却克令三人之逐鹿、今該會體育幹事聲明、謂係羅台棄權於鮑山利、則秩序上之錯誤、誰人負責任耳、今日雙打比賽克拉麥馬駱夫對却克令鮑山利、</p>

<p>許承基因旅途困倦敗於林寳華</p>
<p>雙打賽許邱組二比勝林鄭組</p>
<p>中國網球會於昨日正式開幕、邀請我國遠運選手許承基邱飛海王氏姊妹春威春菁及林寳華鄭兆佳作表演、向來冷落之新加坡路、驟然不所車塞道、倍增熱閙、觀者約四五百人、許邱二君、因方於中午到滬、旅途勞頓、致表演减少、單打林寳華六比三、六比一勝許承基、雙打許邱組以二比一勝林鄭、最後由許與王春威女士對林寳華王春菁作混合混合雙打賽一盤、以助餘興、結果許王組以六比四勝、至於球塲建築、尙未完全竣工、看台及塲地構造極爲精緻、惟塲地甚爲疏鬆、必</p>
<p>須善爲整理、茲將比賽經過述下、</p>
<h3 id="c228">林寳華勝許承基 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>許之擊法、似較全運會時進步、惟旅途固頓、原氣减少、頗有疲於奔命之槪、林寳華則以逸待勞、自當佔得優勢、二人表演、俱甚出色、抽球猛銳而有把握發球尤見特色、誠不可多得之精彩表演、結果爲六比三、六比一、林勝、</p>
<p>第一盤　林先發球、取勝甚易、詐照樣返敬、林又以滑四勝發球局、許亦加一局、成二比二、二人漸展開激烈戰爭、惟許頗露疲態、竟連失三局、而以六比三歸林之勝利、</p>
<p>第二盤　略事休息、繼續比賽許除勝第一次發球局外、竟一失再失、連負六局、因臂力减色、不能管束、是以失誤迭出、加以林銳氣正盛、反手及正手抽球、俱較以前進步、使許疲於應付、林遂以六比一再勝、</p>
<h3 id="c229">雙打評邱勝林鄭 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>單打旣畢、雙打開始、由許阿基邱飛海合組、戰林寳華鄭兆佳、遠無單打之精彩、邱之表演、大爲减色、完全失去管束力、自殺及觸網球甚多、鄭兆佳時好時壞、毫無把握但發球頗佳、林鄭極可得勝不料反遭敗北、許邱以一比六、六比三、六比四勝</p>
<p>第一盤　林先發球、卽得一局、許賴發球之强力、亦勝一球、但以後大鄭合作佳妙、施以猛擊、許邱屢次失誤、一籌莫展、林鄭以六比一勝、甚覺容易、</p>
<p>第二盤　許邱漸行振作、鄭兆佳一再失策、林亦失却鎭靜態度、被許邱猛擊、陷於不支、成五比一之局面、林鄭極力振作、向兩邊或中央掃射、球勢甚急、屢奏奇效、但僅追上兩局、終被許邱以六比三勝、</p>
<p>第三盤　林鄭仍犯自誤之病、野球及觸網球一再發現、幾完全失去控制能力、許邱又以五比一佔優、第六局許曾以發球連勝四記、博得掌聲不少、但第七局林亦以發球勝光局、下局雙方攔網及高壓、大顯美技、林鄭又加二局、卒以四比六負、</p>

<p>— 阿那</p>
<p>設若阿那化爲女士，决不愛這麽一種靑年男士：</p>
<p>論外貎，不高不矮，不太胖也不太廋，頭髮長長，梳的發光；眉目淸秀，鼻端尖起；面部團團，常傅「蝶霜」之類；一身西服，微微發香，燙的平直，皮鞋是響響的，四季常帶着白手套，口掛紙烟一支，鼻架眼鏡一副，袋中永遠響着銀圓………</p>
<p>總之，盡時髦之極致者，棄之如敝屣。　　何以故？有深惡故！人固不可以貎相，然那是天生的貎，天生的貎有妍媸，無法可想的；然人總是穿着衣裳的，一穿衣裳，高下之情立見。有普通之所謂高而其實是卑下，庸俗；有普通之所下而其實是高尙，風雅。常人看衣裳而分貴賤，是未曾求之稍深的。看來近代有許多靑年，也大可以不必那麽穿着。</p>
<p>其次是這種「通品」毫無出息，永遠方方面周到，自己没有主觀，没有意見，其心渾渾，其面所以團團。現於面，盎於背，古人注重一個人的修養，是由外面是看得幾分出的，無論其若何深沈。無出息者，是作事不能成功。聽人家的指揮，從來不會有成就的。</p>
<p>其次是這類典型欠深厚，愛也不足，憎也不深。「水性楊花」，古人駡女子，今世移贈摩登靑年，倒是恰當的。敎其聽命旣唯唯，性情就大可慮了，旣可聽命於我，安知其不聽命於人／</p>
<p>？所以古人訓練奴才，激勵忠節，自有深意。　　還有一層；是善的從來不美，美者從來不眞，眞，善，美三者永遠不能聯合。如眞有所謂愛，不從美生，而從眞生，從善生。這種種摩登風度不過如浮煙，一忽就没有了。</p>
<p>有這幾種根據，所以深惡痛絕。</p>

<p>— 幼軍</p>
<p>一·第二故鄉</p>
<p>每當有人詢問我的故鄕，我在回答「×縣」之後，心裏便想：應當說是開封的！</p>
<p>是的，我想念開封，想念那春水碧波的潘楊湖：想念那古老孤獨的禹王臺，想念那春花爛漫的齊魯公園，想念那風骨崚贈的鐵塔。在這沙漠似的塞外的春天。</p>
<p>離了故鄕，最先蹈到的第一</p>
<p>個都巿，便是開封。那裏使我接受了現代的敎育，那裏覊留過我幾年飄泊的行踪。在那裏我飲了愛的芳醇也飲了愛的苦酒，嘗了人情的溫煦也嘗了人情的炎凉。然而我這異鄕人在這飄泊的流年，終於離却了這故鄉似的異鄕，飄流到别的異鄕了。</p>
<p>天涯芳草，斜陽古驛，每當午夜夢回孤燈如豆之際，我便想起了開封。</p>
<p>啊，繫人魂夢的第二故鄕呵</p>
<p>！</p>
<p>二·潘楊湖</p>
<p>「遠觀高寒睨汴州，繁臺鐵塔與雲浮，萬家無樹無宮闕，惟有黃河滾滾流。」</p>
<p>這是康有爲的龍亭題詩。雕刻在龍亭東邊的石坊上。在龍亭公園改爲中山公園之後，許多標語口號打倒了古雅優美的楹聯，只有牠還徼倖存在，點綴着煮鶴焚琴的殘蹟。</p>
<p>正如這首詩所說：在秋天你　躅在這古舊的龍亭上，望一望那高［塞的碧落，雲霧蒼茫籠罩了萬家房舍，只有鐵塔繁毫鶴立雞羣似的孤　着。空中鴻雁嘹亮。這時，你四顧蒼茫，</p>
<p>眞有「念天地之悠悠，獨愴然</p>
<p>而涕下」的感覺。</p>
<p>下了龍亭，這所謂公園的佈置，花木零亂，傖俗不堪。出了公園，馬路兩邊的兩泓秋水，便是潘楊湖。在從前有楊淸潘濁的傳說，而現在都是同樣混濁的綠色。這時西風吹襟，凉入肌膚，如果獨坐小舟，一棹夷猶，楊湖南有河南圖書館的突入湖中的亭榭，中有新建的茅亭，往北則是蘆葦叢生，水鳬浮游。孤舟中流，凉風滿袖，飄飄然如御風而行。如果你游興未倦，儘可折回湖畔，由橋下駛入潘湖。放乎中流，四顧水天一色，城的西北隅荒凉不堪。斜陽映入水面，燦爛作金黃色。蘆荻蕭蕭，湖畔擣衣聲秋意凄惻，不堪入耳。你如果讀過詩經，大約要憮然漫吟秋水蒹葭的詩篇吧。</p>
<p>使我最難忘的，是十八年秋之暮日：我偕了幾個朋友，在落日昏黃的時候漫步湖畔，倦倚橋頭，驀地瞥見巳經訣絕了的瑩，偕着幾個同學姗姗而來，在我們的視綫接觸時，伊折回身子，翩然自去。</p>
<p>去年我重來梁苑，重尋舊時遊踪，巳經渺無踪跡，人面桃，只增感喟！</p>
<p>如今流落塞外，寂寞凄凉，前塵似夢，一度相思，一度惘然。</p>
<p>三·禹王臺</p>
<p>進了河南農林試騐塲，過了　　道人工挖掘的小河，便看見幾行迎風漫舞的垂柳，禹王臺便在綠柳中高聳着。進了鬥，便是「古吹臺」的木坊。臺上是禹王廟。廟門前有鼓樣的兩塊木頭，據說是禹王治水時的東西。潮內正殿駐紥警察，禁止遊人入廟，東廊上有康有爲的題詩石碑。廟後有一座所謂御碑亭，碑上刻着乾隆似通非通的詩名。臺上古柏參天，蒼茫四顧，可以看見萬家雲樹，迷離渺茫。野闊天低，風聲入耳，令人不禁慨然。</p>
<p>十八年之夏，因爲時局的影響，我們覺校快要解散的時候，我逛了一躺禹王臺。在茶亭旁遇見了奎和芝，在那人造河邊，望着淙淙的流水，悠閒地走着。他們同樣的穿着學校的籃布的制服。如果未曾相識，你會疑惑他們是同性的學生。當時我望着奎，點了點頭，他不自然地笑着，走了。</p>
<p>當年同學中提起了奎和芝，誰不羨慕這一雙靑年情侶！然而人事難知。誰曾想到在次年，他們便因爲家庭的關係而訣絕了呢？以後，我和奎談到他們的關係，便訽問他那一次偕遊的印象，他只是憮然地沉思着。</p>
<p>現在奎已新婚數年，但是我曉得：他不會忘了芝的。</p>
<p>願天下有情人都成了眷屬！</p>
<p>四·齊魯公園</p>
<p>提起筆，我想追叙當年春花爛漫時節齊魯公園的遊踪，但是想到當睥偕遊的秋已經逝世的時候，我是止不住黯然淚落了！</p>
<p>秋呵，你的白骨也許已經化了，而你的純摯的愛却永遠在我的想念裏存在。尤其是那一次的偕遊。</p>
<p>我還記得：那時我們從宋門出來，經過幾條荒凉的街衢，纔到了齊魯公園。迎門便是一簇假山，怪石磷峋，煞有介事地矗立着。園內花划密茂，人工鑿造的河上，有一個亭榭，現在已經記不淸楚這些臺榭的名字。我們穿過花徑，在花畦疏竹之間徘徊。繞過了北邊的樹林，繞過了南邊的葡萄架。在一個茅亭下面憇息。默默地望着爛漫的春花。望着飜飛地彩蝶。休息了一會，又默默地離了這所花園，蹈着暖暖着艷陽歸去。</p>
<p>人事如轉蠋。我終於辜負了伊，獨自飄泊天涯。</p>
<p>在前年，接到了伊的逝世的消息；没有悲哀，没有傷痛，我獨自沉默了幾天，悄悄地流着淚。</p>
<p>的永遠我没有補過的機會了！</p>
<p>這遺恨應當直到天荒地老時的。</p>
<p>五·鐵塔</p>
<p>在開封的荒凉的東北城角，每天還能引起幾個遊人的，便是那風骨崚贈的鐵塔。</p>
<p>在那蔚藍的天幕之下，鐵塔顫巍巍地矗立着。遠遠地望：幾問孤零零的佛寺後面，兀立着一個黑　　的積體，一層一層衝向天空？如果你走到了塔下，抬起頭，望不見塔頂，你會疑惑牠已經衝着了上帝的玉座了吧。</p>
<p>進了塔門，裏邊黑漆漆地，如果你看見了光明，你已經到了塔的第一層了。如果你有勇氣，最好是直登塔頂，在那塔顚：開封的全景便在你的眼前展開，烟霧迷濛中，你隱約可以看見那古老的龍亭，魚鱗似的房屋，工塲的烟囱，中山大學（應該說是河南大學了）的大禮堂，像一個覆着的臉盆。在塔的北邊，一望荒凉，遠遠雲樹迷離，有一道綫也似的河流，那便是黃河了。這時，如果是白日將盡，你可以看見雲霞燦爛，落日如金盆，陣陣歸鴉噪晚，「夕陽無限好，只是近黃昏！」你會幽然長歡吧。</p>
<p>登過了塔，遊興已倦，如果下塔之後，你不感覺腿酸骨酥，那我眞要對你伸出大拇指，說一聲「佩服」了！</p>
<p>只是我此時置身塞上，離汴千里，知何時纔能重來梁苑一快登臨呢！</p>
<p>啊，鐵塔，但願你不要被黃河的濁流衝毁，我們總是後會有期。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c250">家，菩蕯，鴉片烟 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 川人</p>
<p>在四川北部爲了家，菩蕯，鴉片烟三個大部題在鬥爭着，時時現出絕大矛盾的癥結。雖然更要緊更重大的問題也有，不止是家　，菩蕯，鴉片烟三者而巳！可是我偏見所及，只愛談談這個。　　萬里以外的旅行，使我不覺要輕輕唱起Ｅａｓｔ　ａｎｄ　Ｗｅｓｔ，Ｈｏｍｅ　ｉｓ　Ｂｅｓｔ的詩來。可是我所到的地方，他們正大竭力做廢家的運動。四川北部人正和我一樣是道地的中國人脾氣，寗可餓死凍死，不願離開他們那個並不好的老家。因此要主張廢家的人，就成了他們的仇敵，主張癈家的人，他們要消滅父子夫婦以及其他等等的倫常關係，可是主張由齊家而治國的中國人，根本就不願這樣幹，不論在位或在野，不論是士大夫或是勞働者，中國人是要維持家庭關係到千秋萬歲以後的。表面上喊的是中華民國萬歲，實際上是我的家庭萬歲，我的親骨血子子孫孫萬歲。這是天經地義而有無上權威與信仰的主義，有了這個主義，所以任憑什麽主義也打它不進了。因爲四川北部是中國，自然不能有例外，所以一旦敵人如果退出川北，家是抵抗敵人的唯一利器！</p>
<p>中國没有宗敎，要有，只是外來的菩蕯。四川北部人，對於菩蕯，正和别的地方信仰菩蕯者一樣的虔誠。所以毁菩蕯者，就是他們的敵人。自從敵人來了，廟雖然存在，菩蕯却没有了、土地觀音羅漢地藏王，一律遭瘟，丢下毛坑裏去了，可是所有石頭牆上，全都鐫上了敵人的標語。這樣，我們虔誠的信仰菩薩者，那裏肯依，因此而矛盾，而鬥爭，矛盾鬥爭的結果，大多數的虔誠信仰菩蕯者又勝利了。</p>
<p>烟民普遍了四川北部，所有苦力，吃鴉片烟者，十居八九，他們愛鴉片如命，誰不要鴉片烟，就是誰不要他們的命。鴉片成了第二生命，難怪他們口口聲聲咀咒鴉片苗的剷除人了！說也應該，鴉片便宜至一個大铜元一口、三個大銅元一杯，苦力所入雖微，對付這樣便宜的鴉片，自然綽綽然有餘裕了！在敵人的土地上，不見一根烟苗，可見其剷除之力，但最不歡迎者，是大多數的川北烟民。他們認爲這不啻是毁滅他們的生命。最可笑者，他們因爲信仰菩蕯之故，拿他們最寳貴的鴉片，塗滿了菩蕯們的不言之口，黑的鴉片膏，代替了紅的畜牲血。這種怪現象，在接近陜甘的廣元縣所見最多了。據土人說，「菩蕯」不吃「鴉」烟，便不靈騐，也就不能保佑他們的「家」。唉！鴉片烟，菩蕯，家，三者，形成了這樣重要的關係。</p>
<p>中華民國於是科得救了！</p>
<h3 id="c251">跳梯（二） <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>有一天阿梅給玩耍的同伴打了一下，憤怒充滿了她那兩塊腮帮，馬上跑到黃大奶那兒，倚着她底膝哭了。</p>
<p>「趕快給我住聲，打一下就受上起了？誰呌你底父母要了五十塊錢就不要你了？」黃大奶因被擾亂而惱怒地說了，又屈起她底指頭來數着：「黃阿升差五斗，陳永差四斗三升……」</p>
<p>阿梅給這種冷落的待遇驚住了，她舉起發水光的眼睛疑問地望着那陷入苦苦計算裏頭的女人，腦筋回到姑母那兒去。</p>
<p>「這樣呆頭呆腦幹嗎？」黃大奶呌着。</p>
<p>「我，我，姑母爲什魔還不來，爸爸會抱我回去麽？」</p>
<p>「哈！不要做夢吧，」女人很隨便地笑了，「拿起掃帚把地掃一掃，聽我說，以後要是怕捱捱</p>
<p>打，别到外面去好了………」</p>
<p>地球像水車底輪子，日子一天天地被搬移過去，生長着的孩子也漸漸地把他生活着的世界，移入單純的腦海來。顯明地，阿梅底生活經騐，一天天地增加起來，在姑母和柳拂河以外，還有許多她呆想半天也得不着結果的東西；她那營養不大充分的身子，也把日常事務底一部份擔當起來。</p>
<p>每晚上，黃大爺跟老婆睡在床上的時候，阿梅夾在中間輪流替他們搥骨頭，大人們往往興奮地把他底耕人作笑謔，又在悲慘的事實裏求快意的資料。這些經常的殘虐的笑駡，每焦灼着阿梅底被壓抑的心房，然而她底內心和外力爭鬥的結果，又常常使她疲倦下來。有一回她搥着了黃林爺底排尿器那兒，黃大奶變得臉也靑白起來：</p>
<p>「你這賤種，好，今晚不要睡呀！」</p>
<p>她用繩子把阿梅跟那靠門木柱一塊兒綑縛起來，自己熄了燈睡去了，直至阿梅像就在被惡鬼抓去了而哀呌的時候，才把她解下來。</p>
<p>街巿底熱閙的情形和人們一切複雜的聲嚮，窮苦者底呻吟，吹不進黃大爺底家裏來。阿梅在這孤單的，看不見光亮樣的地獄裏探索着那自己不明白的而又渴望着的一種東西。屋裏那唯一的燒飯的女人，在阿梅底眼裏，變成了一個最親近的朋友。</p>
<p>「二姐，你買菜的時候，帶我出去走走也好。」阿梅懇切地要求着。</p>
<p>「十二三歲的孩子，自己不會去麽？」二姐說着，審視着阿梅，一會兒，輕輕地搖着頭說，　　「我看你這樣子，和籠裏鷄差不了多少！我告訴你呀，人不會是這樣地活下去的，」二姐對住這不耐煩聽下去的阿梅繼續說，「就比方一只鷄吧，在籠裏養到肥了，等到人家殺死牠煮着吃的時候，雖然稱讚牠肥嫩，可是，這鷄的本身怎樣了呢？這也不說了，鷄是給人吃的，然而，人是有靈魂的呀！」</p>
<p>阿梅漸漸地長得瘦長起來，然而靈魂不知躱到那裏去，眼睛茫然而怯弱地探視着她所接獨到的東西。職務也跟着她底長度增加了。黃大奶得意地對丈夫說着：</p>
<p>「我們家裏那個，敵得住一匹耕牛了，可是呆笨得很，眞是打一下才走一步！她那陰鬰的眼睛怪討厭地，整天不知在獃着什麽，這種人看來就没有福相的哩！」</p>
<p>阿梅十七歲那年頭，整整地三個月没有下雨，禾田裏的泥土像農夫冬天的戰裂了的脚板一樣：「批接」了黃大爺底田地的耕人們，苦着臉兒上到黃大爺底門來。他們都因田主不理會而跑出去了。</p>
<p>「阿梅，如果有耕人來找我，說我不在家！」黃大爺大聲吩咐說。</p>
<p>他受了命令，在門口坐着，補綴着自己底衣服。</p>
<p>常常來的鄧師爺，密着脚步兒在阿梅面前出現了，眼睛在金絲眼鐘下放肆地閃射着說：　　「黃大爺在家麽？」</p>
<p>阿梅點了點頭讓開身子放那胖子走過。</p>
<p>過了一會，一個佃和戶來了，聽見阿梅底阻止而站住。</p>
<p>「黃大爺不在家裏！」她說了，低下頭來工作着。</p>
<p>「等一刻回來的吧，我坐在這兒等等他。」農夫謹愼地說了坐下來</p>
<p>「你們何苦跑到這兒來呢？這裏没有什麽好玩的呀。」阿梅低聲說了？用手掩着面。那人像没有聽到，沉默着。後來來了三個同伴，他們同樣的坐下來，交談着。</p>

<p>十號雖有賣出、爲數不多、仍覺供不應求、收盤趨勢毫不示弱、再漲一二角左右、一日經過、完全趨漲、自二三角至五六角、獨金短漲八角半之多、因七月份期貨尙未上塲、賣戶觀望、多方易於操縱、亦未始非其原因之一也、成交總數、計共八百二十四萬元、茲將其漲跌情形、列表比較</p>

<h3 id="c278">蓄髮會 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 岑樓</p>
<p>前日申報開封通訊：豫北安陽陰林縣交界施家濂一帶，發現滿蓄長髮之蓄髮會、係漢奸勾結地痞鄕愚圖反動，又有「有麝自然香，不言人自知」離奇口號云。這眞是一個「離奇」的消息。</p>
<p>蓄髮，毫無疑義的，這是一種滿淸制度。當滿淸入關時，當時曾有一種口號，呌作「留髮不留頭，留頭不留髮」。這裏所謂留髮，是指明朝當時所留的一種髮式，那是前後都是茸茸的，不薙的。滿淸入關，要把前後都薙淸，單留上面重要部分，梳在辮子。這是滿淸的一種髮式。滿淸要統治明朝「天下」，同時就不許有明朝髮式的存在，所以有前述那兩句口號發生。待至淸朝未來，革命黨人都把辮子截去，薙成和尙頭，平頂式，或西洋頭。於是和尙頭，平頂式，或西洋頭又都變作了叛逆的標誌。前幾年溥儀截髮，傳說有幾個遣老曾痛哭幾日夜。這可見髮對於滿淸統治的意義是怎樣重大。</p>
<p>豫北安陽縣施家溝一帶的蓄髮會，雖不能就擴大成爲擁護淸朝統治的組織，而且髮至現在，也巳不成爲了滿淸統治的標誌，連滿淸唯一後代子孫溥儀也早已把髮截了，可見這個組織，終究不過是一個離奇的組織，事實上是不會發生什麽大作用的。然而有形的蓄髮，雖不一定有什麽大作用，而無形的蓄髮，</p>
<p>却正控制了中國大塊的土地。</p>
<p>日本的把溥儀傀儡抬上王位，是很有意的，就是一方面要向西侵入蒙古，佈置對蘇防綫，一方面要借這個名義入關，浩浩蕩蕩，來「收復」這個滿淸的「失土」牠目前是如此布置，將來就要如此發動。不久曾傳說溥儀要入關祭陵，這就是一個信號了。到那時，我們雖不至於像明朝末年一樣，再來一套留髮蓄髮的紛擾，但滿洲的奴隸臣民，是有十足的資格去做的。髮的蓄不蓄，其實也無關大局。但民國時代的吳三桂，現正滿滿的站在我們眼前，那是最可怕的。</p>
<h3 id="c279">運動會 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 祥鼎</p>
<p>開運動會了，這是「照章」須舉辦的。</p>
<p>空氣似乎有些緊張，全校一千多位同學，個個都是好漢，在這下是「時勢造英雄」的機會，誰不願去弄牠幾塊「獎牌」，風光一下呢？</p>
<p>平日那幾位「素負盛譽」的運動健將，這時都被聘爲檢察之類，限制參加，理由是：「以免包辦，而資普及」；因此，直接增加了同學們嘗試的雄心，許多素常和運動塲很生疏的朋友，都很野心地去參加；以至像老陳那樣一位“Ｂｏｏｋ－Ｗｏｒｍ”的典型人物，據說心中也不免有些「按捺不住」！有人說，敢是中華民族合該要復興了？</p>
<p>在極大一座運動塲的中央，架着一座渺乎其小的「司令臺」，佈置的簡陋，陳設的塞酸，呌英雄們看着未免有些氣短；某事務員說：「這原不過是一椿「照</p>
<p>章」辦辦的事啊！」</p>
<p>在繁文俗節的開會儀式草草畢事後，接着便開始舉行競賽了；看的人雖是寥寥無幾，但好在還佔了全校的數十分之三的光景，還不十分的使會塲難堪；最難能可貴的：居然有十餘位好許有生以來未履過運動塲一步的「小姐」們，惠</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>然光臨；難得她們這樣早着塵埃，不怕高跟鞋踏在煤悄上煽折了腰肢！</p>
<p>百米，跳遠，高欄，銅球，鐵餅……一椿一椿的平淡地表演過去，看的……都似乎打不起精神來；躡蹀往來，一般的都是活現着一副無聊面孔；誰是爲賞鑑藝術而來的？</p>
<p>不過，話雖如此，但當那絕無僅有的六位女英雄表演時，又當作爲别論了；在她們擦着腿子還未跑的時候，已經呌看的人着了慌，但見爭先恐後，前擠後擁，好一派雜沓光景！</p>
<p>在她們抛鐵餅的時候，大家因爲貪看眞切，擠成一條小　衕似的；以致有兩次鐵餅直飛入人叢中來，雖幸未不校中平添出幾位「烈士」來，却也警戒有餘了！</p>
<p>「爲什麽娘兒們幹事，總呌人埛奮？其間究竟含着什麽哲理？」不知那位朋友在人叢中說的；可是這答案誰也没有本領應承下來。</p>
<p>每當六位女英雄表一種節目完了，便不約而同的有十多隻攝影機圍住了端相；有人說，他們才是道地的藝術賞鑑者！</p>
<p>「乖乖！姑娘們眞好福氣！有這許多人化了本錢來替她們折照！」這是校裏的汽車夫阿二說的；聽的人都笑了，　　不幸得很，在三級跳遠的時候，事出非常：一位運動員因爲賣力過足，「格」的一聲，把一隻足脛骨折斷了！慘白着面色，倒在地上祗有喘氣的份兒；在全塲騷然的一刹那，這位不幸者被抬赴療養院去了；運動會也就此草草終塲了。</p>
<p>在這晚同學們進餐的時候，便平空者</p>
<p>添了一椿谈話的資料；但除了這不幸者的「諸親好友」以我，誰也不守是這樣「談談」而已！</p>
<h3 id="c280">弗如意傳（十三） <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 忘我</p>
<h3 id="c281">當 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>兩人在身上儘量的挖，只挖出十幾個銅子來。外邊的天是全暗下去了，肚子餓得在打鼓，再也想不出　子來　於是我對着朋友提議祗有拿東西去當這條路了，但是這回事從來還没幹過，第一次的劏試未免有點覺得難堪，朋友推我獨個去，我推他獨個去，推來推去没下塲，「要快點呀，餓得要命了，還有這些閒工夫」。結果便一道走。</p>
<p>然而第一個難關來了，因爲我們是住在公寓，夜裏邊帶了偌大的東西出去，定會呌茶房一瞧便心裏雪亮。那可不是先破了臉，商量了一番，漸時讓人拿，一前一後跑出來，避人家的注視。</p>
<p>到了街了，一人挾着一包，連自己也莫明期妙，心房老是突突的跳動着，這有什麽可恥呢，雖然，這末說，可是看見來來往往的路人偶然無意間把眼睛射到我們身上來，就好像被發見了秘密似的，不禁急了一陣，幾科額際都急出汗珠來，心房跳得更加利害，臉皮亦烘烘地燒熱起來。</p>
<p>一種如同做了虧心事的不安寗的感情，在那熱閙的街道上，非常慚愧在走着，差不多連抬起眼睛瞅人家的勇氣都消失，祇管怱忙地低着首向前面走去，走過了好幾條街道，也經過了好幾家我們的主顧的店。想進去，又不敢進去，瞧着許多來往的人，一般勁便馬上住了，像有誰當面淋下一盆冰水在腦袋上，全身都冷下來，望望那牆頭一塊「當」的金牌子，兩人沉沉的嘆息了一下，咒訉着，又頽然地跑開，人多的地方不敢放手，臨街大路的地方也不敢放手。於是祗得向着僻靜的走去了，溜躂了半天，還没有弄成功，內心的不安和跑路跑得皮膚發燒，汗水在一陣陣的流出來，背脊都濕透了。這時候復担憂着會無意間碰見熟識的人，那便更糟，肚子又咕嚕越餓的有此昏，想着眞是急焦。</p>
<p>又走了一程、終於到了認爲可以進去的時候了，心在卜卜地劇跳，是非幹不可了，不守因太慌張，怕給內邊那些傢伙起疑心，以爲我們是扒兒子，偷了</p>
<p>東西的，那就倒霉，祇得站在門口一下，竭力鎭定精神，才一攢勁兒跑了進去。</p>
<p>出來的時候，好像另外換了一個人，身子輕鬆得有如燕子一般，氣量也壯了聽着袋裏玲玎嚮的銀子的聲音，宛如聽到那街上散佈着無綫電的流行曲一般快樂起來。不過想起適才躱躱肉閃的樣子，和惡鬰的心情，又不禁都苦笑着。</p>
<h3 id="c282">决斷 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 洪</p>
<p>也許是因爲民族太老大了，我們的同胞大多有一種至足痛恨的劣根性，就是因循，猶預，畏怯，苟安。說得使勁一點，幾十年來的備受列國的欺凌宰割，以及自家人的混戰紛爭，都是這劣根性召惹的災星。</p>
<p>過去還彷佛，這種劣根性只及於中年以上的人羣。</p>
<p>現在呢，越發蔓延得廣闊了。一般原是生氣勃勃的靑年，也都染受了它的傳佈，隨處只見因循，猶預，畏怯，苟安的呻吟，没有果敢，决斷，英發，猛進的呼聲；只有奄息的哼聲，没有痛快的口號。</p>
<p>一般人就是這般欺騙自己，欺騙他人，什麽「老成持重」，什魔「沉着」，「什麽「顧及環境」，總得用各種的方式設法迴避，使這劣根性日有進步，年見普遍。</p>
<p>這不能不說是中華民族積弱的病源，國家老没有長進的基因。</p>
<p>時代在邁進，世事幻變日亟，深有這種劣根性的我們的同胞，怎能追踪上去呢？必然的是要遭受無限的磨折。</p>
<p>我認爲這世間最呆憐的，就是這些遇事舉棋不定，猶豫不决，遇事徬徨歧途，莫知所趨的人，就是這些自己没有主義，不能决擇，而惟人言是聽的人，這種主意不定，没有决斷的人，絕不能得到别人的信任，好絕不能建立自己有進步有光采的生命。</p>
<p>有多少人簡直是無地不狐疑寡斷，充分發揮他的因循，猶豫，畏怯，苟安，的劣根性。他們不敢决定種種事件，因爲他們不知道，没有把握、這决定的結果究竟是好是壞，是凶是吉。他們恐怕，要是今天决定這樣，或許會發現這個决定的錯誤，而至後悔莫及，這些習於猶豫的人，對於自己，完全失却了自信，所以有事當前，他們總没有决斷。有些人，本來本領很强，人格又好，但是因爲有了因循，猶豫，畏怯，苟安的習慣，以致他們的一生，也就糟蹋了。　　我認爲國人的這種習慣，劣根性，是應急切的捩轉過來，尤其是我們靑年人，應竭力排除，積極培養果敢，决斷，英發，猛進的精神。凡有事件當前，需要自己决定，則就應從速决定，不要留待明日。留待去旁徵别人不負責任的意見。自己應當隨時去練習敏捷而堅毅的决定。事無大小，不管日常生活，總不應該猶豫。</p>
<p>自然不能說，每一個人没有錯誤。不過我以爲，富於决斷，果敢的人，卽使有錯誤，也不打緊。因爲不管他錯誤的次數有多少，然而他在事業上的進行，總會比那些膽小，猶豫的人有希望，有用得多。站在河的此岸，呆立考慮的人，是永遠不能渡登彼岸。</p>
<p>固然，在决定某一事件以前，我們應各方面都看到，我們應愼重的考慮，應各方面都看到，我們應愼重的考慮，在下决定以前，尤應運用全副的理智作指導。但是一經决定，就應讓它决定，成爲最後的，不應再有所回顧，不應重新考慮。</p>
<p>這種决定，對於某一個人都有無窮的好處。不但對自己有信任，而且還能得到别人的信任。漸渐練成一生的習慣，其穩固有如海底的水一般，不受感情意氣的震盪，也不輕易給别人的批評及種種外界的侵襲所打動。</p>

<p>帶着熱帶氣息的南風一吹，驀然從夢裏驚醒似的，我纔知道春天巳闌，現在完全是初夏時節了。</p>
<p>眞的，在這没有季候更變的實感的大都會裏，要没有薰風吹來，你怎麽會知道是初夏了呵！</p>
<p>初夏，想到這個名詞，心裏便怪空虛似地，像有一股悵惘的情緖襲來。然而又是那麽含着熱情的眷弦戀的啦。</p>
<p>初夏使我想起了故鄕。</p>
<p>故鄕的初夏是可愛的。緋紅的石榴花，綴滿在蒼翠的夏山上，你要是在山道中走着的話，有一陣陣草木的淸香，送進你的鼻管，聞着聞着，會把你浸得沈醉。</p>
<p>波着淸澄的漣漪的小池塘裏，水面浮滿着黃色的小花，那是映眼明的菱花。幾頭活潑的鴨子，在池裏游着，怪自在的。</p>
<p>原野是廣闊的，綠的麥子泛着淺淺的鵝黃，在艷麗的陽光下閃耀。蠶荳和豌荳，都已結實纍纍的，逗人採　了。　　啾啁的燕子，穿織着柳絲；哀怨的鷓鴣，啼着凄急的調子。</p>
<p>啊！記憶裏的初夏的故鄕，是那麽</p>
<p>富有詩意而値得眷戀的呵！</p>

<p>— 淸</p>
<p>一個沿街乞求的呌化子，臉孔兒看去至少是四十開外的人，然而身材却特别短少，幾乎不上三尺高，走着一拐一拐地，如果不留意到他的面部，誰也會以爲那是一個小孩子的。這樣，他便成爲大家心眼中的怪物了，背後跟着一夥人，在筈着說着，奇異着爲什麽會有那末一副四不像的模樣，跟着的人只覺得好玩，像看大世界一身兩頭的怪胎一樣。他走過每一家店子，伸着手討銅子，在平常，他們一瞧見這些人，不是叱咤，便是加以侮辱，就是幸而能够掉出一個銅子給他們所認爲最厭惡的人，一定還是要擺出一種難看的顔色。可是對於眼前這末一個畸形的人物，大槪是因畸形吧，於是引起了人們的好奇心，都　着一面詼諧的嘴臉，望上望下的儘瞧着</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>，而那個矮子只管中中唸唸的說着，伸着手要銅子，他站了好一回，那店裏有個預備抛出銅子來，却被另一個阻止着說：緩緩着，再瞧一下，一面鑑賞着，一面就儘量地取笑着，調侃着。這周圍所給予他的臉色和奚落他似乎全不曾感到。事實上這種遭遇本就到處皆是，受也受慣了，他唯一的希望祇是在銅子上面，便是吐一口唾涎在他臉上，他也管不了。不幸的是父母生他這麽一個不三不四的怪像，使其受人們泠酷的報酬之外，再加上一層無情的戲謔。但不幸的地方有時却正是幸處，像這個矮人，沿着街每家乞銅子總可以乞到多少的。爲因人們都拿着來開玩笑，一個銅子也便不在意中，不過多看一瞬，多留難一下而已。</p>
<p>等看到興緻消沉了，才讓他走，走着，一顚一撅，眞有如水鴨陸行似的，打趣的人也同樣跟了上去，一邊吵着，一邊大聲地笑，鼓着掌，表示滿開心的樣了。</p>
<p>侮駡，調戲，玩哈哈，已經是十分尋常的了，而這些人根本亦用不着别人的同情，只求铜子得到手罷了。</p>

<p>我是中華路九六九弄十八號的房客，現在受着朱振陸律師代表業主敦和堂，勒遷的通知，我想盡計劃，也没有適當的能力，可以難持契約。所以懇求　　先生和一般巿民，預定穩當的計劃，替我解决困難。現在先把該律師的通知寫出來：</p>
<p>「敝堂房屋破舊不堪，無法修理，爲防止危險起見，限於五月底一律遷出，决不通融。」</p>
<p>查我所居的房屋，由胡文記營造廠（卽我）在民國七年營造，當時立有保單，保證堅固有二十年的時期。造價不過三百多元，租給我後，按月租金十元，後增加二成。在一二八時。該業主違抗　　巿政府明令，迄未遵令免租。又用廢歷收租，剝削房客經濟，且從民國十八年春季到現在，是五年多了。絕不容房客以墊納該業主應繳的房捐抵租，致房客所墊捐額有三十餘元之多。查本巿建築規則，房屋如有危險，自有工務局查勘，通知房客出屋。現在該律師諉稱無法　理，似難據以爲凖，從没有學習營造按術的律師，來武斷勒遷，其放逐房客的心理，彰彰明矣。我們流離失所，犧牲，該是怎樣重大？這樣無理的侵犯和壓迫，未諳法律的民衆，誰都知道不能盡力抵抗。所以懇求</p>
<p>先生俯賜拯救，登載業餘信箱欄內，請先生和一般仗義者，替我來解决因難並希望對於减租事宜發表意見。敬請大安　　胡文記營造廠胡根生謹啓</p>
<p>答：照來信所述，房東迫你遷讓，毫無理由可言，你自可據理與房東方爭，如房東不答應，亦可根據契約所載，向法庭起訴，請求履約。所以你的問題並不難解决，至如一般房租高昻，我們應當提議减租，這問題却頗爲重要，你／旣提出討論，現在我們就談談如何。</p>
<p>在這經濟恐慌的年頭，一般小巿民生活艱窘已極，而房租負擔又奇重，於是他們在無可奈何之際，便儘量緊縮生活費。節衣縮食，不過個人生活不大美滿罷了，於身體還無多大害處，若把住屋標凖降低，不待言於個人及公共衛生均大有妨礙。所以减低房租不但是使一般經濟困難的巿民得以稍舒，整個巿政，全體巿民，也無不蒙其益。但是上次减租運動，雖熱閙一時，發動這個運動的祇是少數人，一般巿民也不爲這事積極努力，所以這個運動没有力量，結果成效有限，可說是失敗了。所以，爲巿政前途着想，爲减輕一般巿民負擔着想，巿政當局及全體巿民均有復興這個運動的必要。而要使這個運動成功，又必需全體巿民聯合起來，共同向房東提出要求，减租纔能實現。否則，單靠政府命令，像胡君房東那樣「迄未遵令减租」的事，仍恐怕難免。總之，减租是大家的事，不是一二個人的問題，胡君有自己立的保單等鐵的理由，還可據理力爭，若在旁人，則除了遵從勒遷外，還有什麽辦法。故我希望大家對於這問題不</p>
<p>容忽視，應當加以相當注意。編者</p>

<p>「上海没有瞧得上世界貿易公司經理先生服的美的的女子啊！」那個神秘的太太說起上海話來。</p>
<p>上海的漂亮男子倒底是聰敏的，「你勝利了！」緊緊地摟着，重重地吻着。</p>
<p>「你也没有失敗呵！」埋在溫暖的懐中笑着說。</p>
<p>「你可以告訴我你的名字嗎？」</p>
<p>「ＭＡＤＡＭＸ。」率直的。</p>
<p>明天，今天的下一天，上海之夜後的上海之晨，世界貿易公司經理王敏蓀先生從甜蜜的夢中醒來，他第一件事是從溫暖的被窩中伸出優秀的手指整理卓别林的頭髪，他彷彿感得那美的的北平太太失了所在，不，現在應該說是一個都巿中秘神的女子。他的手臂從枕上橫過去，免强睜開考門爾的眼珠子，一縷昨夜遺留着的百合花香送進他希佛萊的鼻子，「ＭＡＤＡＭＸ」他輕輕地哼着，做了個擁抱的樣子！啊！昨夜的夢，甜蜜的夢，夢中月圓花正榮……</p>
<p>「ＭＡＤＡＭＸ。」他聽見浴室中水聲嘩啦嘩啦的響。</p>
<p>没有回答。</p>
<p>一個新奇的念頭在他心上滋長出來，他輕輕的離了被窩，趿上拖鞋，像做賊似的躡手躡脚站起來的時候，一張塗了幾行字的信箋，映進考爾門的眼珠子。</p>
<p>伸出優秀的手指，從台上接過來，身體坐到床邊。</p>
<p>王先生：</p>
<p>對不起，眼前需要一筆欵子，六千元的支票帶走了，但是你没有失敗，不必認眞地在三百萬人口中搜尋一個没有眞姓名的ＭＡＤＡＭ　Ｘ；不幸而被報紙宣揚開來，或者對於你世界貿易公司的經理地位有所不利。謝謝你，我們或許有再見面的時候。　　ＭＡＤＡＭＸ</p>

<h3 id="c288">中國電影之現在觀（上） <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 亞羣</p>
<p>近年來中國電影是進步了，這是無可否認的事實，而同時中國觀衆也是飛速的進步，更是非常明白的事實。這二者中間，顯然有一種比重，卽是說後者比前者進步快。</p>
<p>可不中麽？中國觀衆，特别是小巿民層的觀衆，他們對於電影作家有着强烈的要求。關於這一事實的證明，我們可從好些影片中獲得。「人道」獲得了廣大的觀衆，而「狂流」「春蠶」「小玩意」也獲得了廣大的觀衆。此外「姊妹花」的賣座，打破世界影片的賣座記錄，等而下之，「人生」，「中國海的怒潮」，「鹽潮」，乃至於「暴雨梨花」，「風」，都使觀衆們非常興奮。至於「城巿之夜」，「都會的早晨」或是「母性之光」，更是不消說得的了。</p>
<p>從這些影片中，我們可知道觀衆們對於電颢作家的要求是什麽，他們的需要是什麽了。他們要求電影作家反應目前社會的眞實，當他們給殘酷的現實毁滅了往日之幻夢的時候，他們希望在電影中得着對於自身苦悶的解决方法。而因着上述諸片都是或多或少的提出了，而且解决了部份的社會問題，雖然關於分析和解决都有個别的錯誤觀念，或是有意的曲解，但是每一部作品都曾經探取了平凡的與普遍的現實，以使大部份觀衆們，對於影片中的一切，並不隔閡，相反的，和自己的生活情感發生了密切的聯緊。</p>
<p>自然，這還須重覆說明，「人道」或「城巿之夜」之能够獲取觀衆，自有其毒害的成份存在，特别是「姊妹花」，迎合了小巿民層的落後的世界觀，更成爲我們所應當予以絕大注意的作品。然而這中間並不是不折不扣的證實了觀衆没有辯别能力，或是樂意接收影片中的錯誤指示，而客觀的，一方面是作者探取了足以使他們興奮的題材，另一方面是個别的作者用着强烈的手段，强姦了觀衆的意志。</p>
<p>當然，我們並不必在這裏要求電影作者從良心的出發而自責，不過眞正有着新的而正確的世界觀的作家，卽由於自發的正義感的强調！他們也不會存心欺騙觀衆。進一步說，在不久的將來，陳腐的作家，將必然爲進步的觀衆所遺棄。祇有他們的意見的融匯，才是最公正的裁判。</p>
<p>以上，充分的說明了中國電影觀衆是怎樣熱烈的要求着電影作家，同時，也是保留着强有力的判斷以監視作家，是否盡了他們所應盡的責任。</p>
<p>那末，直到現在爲止，電影作家是怎樣滿足觀衆之要求的呢？正如前面所說，在好些影片中，那些進步的作家們，是階級的探取了貧窮對照的方法，而且多少看淸了被壓迫階層之勝利的前途。這一方面，應當是一二八而後中國電影最顯著的成績，同時也是小巿民層觀衆最低限度的勝利。</p>
<p>不過，因着環境不許可而每日覺得步履維艱的原故，一方面固有要恥的曲電影的論者，便以「光明的尾巴」當作口實，而加以譏諷的冷笑，有如烟幕彈似的企圖在冷酷的笑聲中對於這一傾向加以破壞。再加上軟性電影論者與反對標語口號之論者們在一旁敲着邊鼓，於是一部份比較脆弱的作家們，更加覺得難堪了。不過頑强而堅定的作家是不會因此而動搖的，假使他們是下確的認淸了現實，他們的作品將必然得着千萬的觀衆强有力的支持，因而他們的存在是不會被任何惡劣勢力所動搖的。</p>
<p>在這裏有一個最主要的條件，那便是作者得忠實於觀衆，有如忠實於藝術同樣重要。應該把自己的作品不獨能爲觀衆所接受，更得成爲一種爭鬥的武器。因之，不妨在此提出幾點，作爲目前迫切的任務再决定。　　（未完）</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c289">「紅粉鐵血」評 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 丁玎</p>
<p>故事是描寫一個軍閥的罪惡。</p>
<p>這裏値得我們稱讚的是導演的手法，他把全劇的情節很緊凑地展開，鏡頭與鏡頭間的連接又是這樣密切而簡潔，例如：</p>
<p>（一）由高彦在陸元甫家中霄的戲李雪娟之時手部的大寫，化入林振霄的兩隻脚塞進長統的皮鞋。在自己家裏預備出門，因爲房門的鑰匙給雪娟帶走，拿不到武裝帶，所以跑到陸家去找她，因此而發現高彦的野心。</p>
<p>（二）由林振霄發覺陸元甫夫婦之惡計後，搗毁他家中的陳設，那座幾乎被毁的時鐘及他們夫婦的照片，化入林振霄家裏的時鐘及他夫婦的照片再接以後危機的到來。</p>
<p>其他小技巧的穿插很少，兩個高潮，一個是高彦調戲林妻，被林破門發覺的塲面，一個是最後當高彦正欲加林妻以侮辱的時候，被林所殺，也佈置得很適當。</p>
<p>但有幾個小地方，我們應該加以討論的：</p>
<p>（一）一個營長的太太，而且家裏還有了這樣富麗的設備，實際上她是否會</p>
<p>自己去燒菜煮飯呢？</p>
<p>（二）從高彦傲視一切的神氣，目無法紀的行爲上看來，給他一個旅長的官銜，似乎還嫌太小，說他是軍長或師長，不更適合嗎？</p>
<p>（三）當林振霄被驅到旅長那裏以後</p>
<p>，林妻在家中久等她的丈夫不回，一定是十分焦急不安的，這是一個可以增强劇的力量，而且也容易感動人的塲面，不應該忽略的，爲什麽畫面上竟找不到一個鏡頭，完全把牠遺忘了呢？</p>
<p>演員中范雪朋是很顯着的有了進步，比在「舞宮春夢」中。當丈夫無辜被捕以後，在監獄中相會時的悲痛的表情，以及最後爲了要救丈夫，去懇求那軍閥的時候，無可奈何地忍受他侮辱的情態，演來是多麽自然而動人呵！五元龍的表演，老練深刻，自有獨到之處，湯傑的惡軍閥也還不差，不過那飾陸元甫的蕭正中的一副哭臉，做得太過火了。</p>
<p>攝影平平。</p>
<h3 id="c290">寫在「雪恥」演出之前 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 羅拔高</p>
<p>自「生路」在滬開映後，蘇聯的電影產品，已在中國電影院的營陣裏，增加了一部有力的隊伍，雖然她的出品運華並不多。</p>
<p>現在這部「雪恥」是蘇聯第一部有聲對白的出品，爲了要在國外的巿塲佔一席地，片上便像德國出品一樣地加上很簡要的英文說明。</p>
<p>「雪恥」的主要題材是鐵廠工人在集</p>
<p>團裏的一種生產建設運動的成功；在初次五年計劃實施後的一部力作。片的原文呌「羞恥」“Ｓｂａｍｅ”來到中國就變成了「雪恥」了。「雪恥」兩字也能够成立，因爲劇的演進是廠工方面計劃成功巨型的瓩輪，結果是扯碎羞恥這旗，在百折不撓底努力下得到最後的勝利。</p>
<p>以生產建設爲電影的題材，怕祇是蘇聯電影當局才能够有這般的認識吧！電影之被視爲社會羣衆敎育，我想好衹有蘇聯電影當局才有更深切的了解吧！他們在政府的五年計劃的實施，他們便以電影在社會羣衆敎育的上頭作一種大力的補助。他們在劇旨上面，認定戀愛是個人生活的一部，生產建設才是羣衆生活的全般。如「雪恥」，他們構造出來是：在戀愛上個人方面得到美滿的家庭，而尤其在建設上，在生產人，廠工的集團得到最後的成就。意識的偉大與嚴肅，美國電影是不可同日而語的。</p>
<p>民族之被壓迫與欺凌，原有其某物腐蟲生的自侮性。這自然是羣衆的生產建設運動被漠視了。自私自利在今日已違背了做人的條件，集團的生產建設才是向民衆上頭，我認定是不右忽視的。</p>
<p>就電影藝術而論：「雪恥」也是成功的。劇作者的思想非常縝密，結構上又能曲折地把嚴肅偉大的劇旨，透切地在劇的演進上展開，緊嚴而有起伏的峰巒與波濤。像劇作者的思想一樣有关缜密的組織。Ｍｏｎｔａｇｅ是無右置議的了。關於演員，每個都經過一種良好的訓練，故表演的沉着與自然，在好萊塢裏成名的明星中好不可多得。總之，全劇的演出，是使蘇聯以前那無聲的出品「生路」不能專美於前。</p>
<p>我以爲「雪恥」並不是在娛樂的條件之不產生出來的，其意義的嚴正，在社會羣衆的敎育上面，當然得到一種最大的效率。注意社會羣衆敎育的電影從業員，相來不至於忽視這部「雪恥」吧！</p>

<p>— 馨甫</p>
<p>琴恩走過了好幾處水手的會合塲所，因爲必須和女人斷絕往來的關係。到處碰釘子，後來來到一家咖啡店內，這是一處水手們的消魂窟，琴恩進去後，看見那男的女的摟着抱着的情形，那裏還敢啓口呢，但是事有凑巧，這天有幾個水手，爲了爭風吃醋，結果反受了女人的暗算，報告警察，前來捕拿他們，他們發現了這事情後，知道上了女人的當，痛恨萬分；並且因爲不便再在岸上停留，急於要航海去，琴恩窺破了他們的秘密，知道時不可失，就走向前去和他們接洽，當然是一說就成功了。</p>
<p>除去這幾個亡命的水手外，琴恩還曾找着一個廚司丨黑人，一個工程師！西班牙人，一位營造師！巴黎人，還有醫師巴斯克，據說他是因爲受不了丈母娘的怨氣才逃出來的。到了遊艇啓程的那一天，麥克穿着船長的服裝，來到船上，召集了船上所有的人員，開了一次訓話會，他們的第一個戒條，就是不能上岸去和女人親近，一會兒，汽笛鳴鳴，在大家合唱着「戀愛，再會吧！」的歌聲中，那遊艇鼓着輪，向海面上駛去了。全舟中人，認爲萬惡的女姓，從此隔絕·一個個莫不意氣飛揚，歡騰萬分。</p>
<p>一九二六年三月二十三日，穿過火島了……一九三一年三月十一日，穿過葛利斯角燈塔了，這樣一天又一天，一年又一年的過下去，他們的五年期限倒又快滿了，但是，愛慾是人生的天性，决不能永久隔絕的，這時除掉麥克，大家早就感覺性的飢渴，時常發生幻想，站在船頭上，會看見水面上顯出女人的麗影來；睡在床上，會做着甜蜜的夢，一個個都要變成瘋漢快了，他們打夥兒狂呼怒駡的在船艙裏跳着閙着，麥克跑上去，要想阻止他們，不料反激動了他們的怨氣，大家一致狂喊起來：「我們在船上的生活已經受够了！我們要上岸去啊！」「那麽你們的合同呢？你們拿去的錢呢？」麥克這樣回答着。「錢嗎？」大家狂笑着說，「我們有錢無處用，要它幹甚！」麥克知道不可理喩，悄然的離去了。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，麥克在船頭上站着，忽然瞧見海面上，有一個人體在沉浮着，他連忙打發水手們，放下救生船救將起來，不料是一位身御浴衣的絕色美人，雪白的皮膚，軟嫩的肌肉，這一朶出水芙蓉，給那班日夜渴望着女性的男子漢看見，那能無動於中？於是一個個圍攏來，笑着閙着，麥克實在有些看不過去，對他們說：「爲什麽大家都這樣注視眘，難道你們從前没有看見過女人嗎？」這時那被救的女子，尙在昏迷中，他又回過頭來對琴恩說：「快去拿一杯白蘭地酒來吧！」　（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Tingzhi, a representative of the Jilin righteous army, came to Nanjing and spoke in detail about the situation in the Northeast and the course of the Yilan civil uprising in March of this year. (1) The cause of the Yilan farmers'激變 was the Japanese confiscation of land in thirteen counties in eastern Jilin to be used as reclamation zones. Our land deeds were confiscated, and our people were driven away. All privately owned firearms in the provinces and counties of the Northeast were gradually confiscated by the Japanese. However, the thirteen counties in eastern Jilin refused to hand over their weapons. The Japanese used military force to suppress them, forcing each hundred households to provide five young girls to be used as prostitutes for the Japanese army to ravage. They massacred innocent youths and plundered villages extensively. The counties of eastern Jilin were the anti-Japanese base of former Generals Li Du, and they possessed a strong sense of national consciousness. (2) The course of the uprising began with the farmers in the third district of Yilan County, who rose up in revolt and elected Xie as the commander-in-chief and Zhou as the chief of staff. They continued to use the name of the self-defense army. Farmers in other districts responded successively. The people of Boli and Huachuan counties also continued to respond. At the beginning of the uprising, they destroyed their fields and gardens as a scorched-earth tactic. (3) The course of the battle: Starting on March 10th, they attacked Tulongshan, engaging in more than twenty battles with the Japanese army in Tulongshan, Taipingzhen, Jiulihe, Dongjingou, and other places. They killed over three hundred Japanese soldiers, including Commander Ichizawa and Colonel Iizuka, shot down four Japanese aircraft, and seized a large quantity of Japanese ammunition and equipment. Our army suffered over seven hundred casualties. Currently, all three counties of Yilan, Boli, and Huachuan, except for the county seats, are occupied by our forces, totaling 25,000 people.

At the same time, all member states of the Universal Postal Union were notified that all mail passing through the Northeast should be forwarded by sea. On the 16th of this month, the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues of the League of Nations convened a meeting to discuss the postal communication issue and decided on three principles, which are still a provisional remedy for saving the facts, but are only technical liaison procedures when the mails of various countries pass through the Northeast. Strictly speaking, they are still advisory in nature and have no binding force. Our country has not only not had any negotiations with Japan at present, but also has not considered adapting measures in accordance with this principle. Various external rumors are purely speculation. As for the pseudo-country mails, they are still blocked, and all mails smuggled out of the customs will be detained if they are found.

However, the economic situations of the United States, Britain, and Japan are all unfavorable. Their general populations are becoming increasingly impoverished due to increased military spending. Under these conflicting circumstances, the authorities of each country still dare not abandon the idea of arms limitations.</p>
<p>Prior to this preliminary naval disarmament conference initiated by Britain, there were rumors that the United States and Britain would first seek understanding. Later, it was heard that Britain, unwilling to offend Japan, decided to invite Japan, France, and Italy to participate together. News from Tokyo even stated that the content of the British invitation had made it clear that the conference would focus solely on naval issues for individual negotiations. If this statement is true, then the initiation of the so-called preliminary naval conference is essentially at the instigation of Japan and merely presented by the London government. Anyone with even a slight understanding of the current international situation knows that Far Eastern political issues and naval ratios are inextricably linked. The Japanese propaganda is not credible, and it is self-evident.</p>
<p>Let us set aside this point and focus solely on the technical issues of naval disarmament. (1) Britain has proposed reducing the maximum tonnage of battleships from 40,000 tons to 25,000 tons, while hoping that Britain would lead the way in small cruisers. Unfortunately, the US government is unlikely to agree to this proposal. Even Britain's old ally, Japan, will not easily agree. Britain's territories span the globe, and the locations of its naval ports and fortresses are also ideally situated. Whether it is coal, water, food, or oil, everything is exceptionally convenient. Reducing the tonnage of battleships would allow for an increase in the number of small warships. For the British, this would not only lighten the burden but also increase their strength. Furthermore, ships using steam and internal combustion engines belonging to Britain account for nearly one-third of the world's total, amounting to a massive 22 million tons. In the event of war, it would not be difficult to convert merchant ships into cruisers with 6-inch or smaller caliber guns. Therefore, there is no doubt that Britain's proposal stems purely from self-interest. However, the position of the United States is different. The United States wants to maintain its communication lines between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, including the three key fortresses of Alaska, Hawaii, and the Panama Canal. Only large ships with high tonnage can effectively exert naval power and maintain its military advantage. As for Japan, its national territory is small, and its territories are close. The navies of its neighboring countries, China and Russia, are not strong enough to compete with it. If based on the fundamental principle of naval disarmament of non-aggression, reducing the tonnage of battleships would not only save money but also avoid long-distance attacks by Britain and the United States, which seems advantageous. However, Japan is planning something in the Pacific, not only wanting to compete with the United States for dominance but also never forgetting Australia and the South Seas. Therefore, its support for the United States in the belief that battleships should not be completely abolished is for other reasons.</p>
<p>(2) Next is the issue of submarine characteristics. The United States, Britain, and Japan all have different ideas. The navies of the United States and Britain do not rely heavily on submarines, but Japan believes that they are defensive weapons and cannot be abolished. It is expected that in future conferences, Japan will again advocate for a naval force that is "sufficient for defense but not sufficient for offense," demanding that each country be allowed to maintain the warships it deems most suitable. Its intention is to rely on submarines as offensive weapons to operate widely in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, threatening the approaching navies of Britain and the United States. (3) What Japan fears most is attacks from the air force. However, the land-based air force bases of various countries, with the exception of Vladivostok, are all relatively far from Japan. The threat of air strikes is not very strong. However, naval aircraft carriers are different. The actions of aircraft carriers are fast and can be used freely. Japan is most wary of them and opposes them most strongly. Navy Minister Osumi has already expressed his intention to propose the abolition of aircraft carriers, indicating his firm attitude. It is still difficult to make a specific judgment on how Britain and the United States will respond, but based on a common-sense prediction of the general situation, they may not be willing to easily agree and weaken their own forces.</p>
<p>(4) Finally, attention must be paid to the issue of military bases. The United States has already allowed the independence of the Philippine Islands. The military facilities on the islands will naturally be gradually relaxed. Japan is taking the opportunity to express that not only should the fortresses of the Philippines and Guam be restricted, but the military construction in Hawaii and the naval port facilities in Singapore should not be exceptions either. It is speculated that Japan will demand that Britain and the United States abandon their naval bases and all military facilities on the Pacific islands and Singapore as one of the conditions for exchanging naval ratios, which is not without credibility.</p>
<p>From all of this, it can be seen that there is very little room for reconciliation on the technical issues of naval armaments among the three countries at the preliminary conference. If political issues are involved, it will undoubtedly cause more disputes. The reefs ahead of the preliminary conference are already so numerous that the difficulty of success for the formal conference is even more conceivable.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Roosevelt Orders Changes to National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) Regulations <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Accepting Criticism, Aiming for Perfection</p>
<p>Price Fixing Returns to Individual Industries</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today ordered the cancellation of the points in the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) regulations that stipulated fixed prices, replacing them with articles for self-handling. National Recovery Administration (NRA) Director General Johnson was ordered to devote himself to the main parts of the industry regulations, so that they would not be attacked by the outside world during implementation. The President's announcement of this order clearly came about because of recent criticisms of the National Recovery Administration. Big industrialists believed that these industry regulations favored workers, and so complained volubly. Small industrialists, on the other hand, believed that they gave big industrialists the convenience of monopolizing, and so expressed resentment that they had no way to survive. President Roosevelt had said that if the government's experimental methods did not work, he would be prepared to adopt other methods. Now he is putting these words into practice, issuing the order on Sunday so that it could be implemented starting Monday morning. Small industrialists</p>
<p>Most strongly opposed the points in the National Industrial Recovery Act regulations that stipulated fixed prices. The implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act regulations and various industry regulations has been repeatedly criticized. Observers therefore predict that the National Industrial Recovery Act regulations will be completely reformed, which will be an important step for Washington in the future. While big and small industrialists were attacking the National Industrial Recovery Act regulations, consumers insisted that since the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act in June of last year, the prices of most goods had skyrocketed, and union spokesmen even stated that the National Industrial Recovery Act was nothing more than an appendage of big industry. Senator Nye made this prediction a month ago: that President Roosevelt would change the National Industrial Recovery Act regulations and break with big industrialists. It is said that the National Industrial Recovery Act originally hoped that industrial profits would be distributed fairly between labor and capital, but who knew that capital's profits far exceeded those of labor, the burden on consumers increased, and their purchasing power did not increase. (National News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued an order today that many industries currently managed by industry regulations can now govern themselves</p>
<p>. Articles in the industry regulations that stipulated prices, etc., are all abolished, but articles concerning working hours and wages remain. NRA Director General Johnson will decide what kinds of industries this order applies to. The work of the NRA will be greatly reduced in the future. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>San Francisco: Several newspapers widely circulated throughout the country published editorials today stating that the silver policy was a political action by the government under pressure from the silver faction in Congress. This action will increase the insecurity of business, but it is recognized that the silver policy encourages international use of silver and that a gold-based currency system is indeed desirable. If agreed upon by all countries, a bimetallic standard with 75% gold reserves and 25% silver reserves is more effective than the current gold standard. However, contrary to expectations, there is still no hope for international agreement. If the United States unilaterally implements this system, it will inevitably have currency conflicts with other countries, which will increase international disputes, and this move is also very dangerous domestically.

<h3 id="e43">Competition in the Atlantic Skies Between Airplanes and Airships <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>French Aviator Flies Directly to New York</p>
<p>Zeppelin Airship Goes to Brazil</p>
<p>(New York) Today, an Associated Press reporter on the Mahadden mail ship, which was sailing from New York to London, received a wireless message from aviators Rossi and Cordu, who were 260 miles east of New York. The reporter reported that the sea was calm, the sky was clear, and the wind was light. Rossi and Cordu departed from the Le Bourget airfield near Paris at 5:10 AM on the morning of the 26th to fly to the United States, intending to fly to California in order to break their long-distance flight record. Their plane is a monoplane with 500 horsepower. (National News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(New York) Wireless stations here received a report from French aviators Codos and Rossi, saying, "We are currently flying over Nova Scotia (Note: a province on the Atlantic coast of eastern Canada). Steering is extremely difficult. Nothing is visible outside. Everything is safe." Currently, all radio stations along the Atlantic coast of the United States have been ordered by their superiors to monitor the arrival of the two aviators. Radio stations along the coast of Canada have also received similar orders. According to Dr. Kimball, Director of the New York Weather Bureau, the climate along the Atlantic coast is still conducive to flight. The only concern is that Codos and Rossi may encounter rain in the Nova Scotia area. However, the wind direction is currently maintaining its normal state. Normally, at this time of year, the wind here is often from the west, but it has suddenly turned to an east wind, which is unusual. It is likely that if Codos and Rossi decide to fly over New York City and then west, they will use this east wind to fly directly from Nova Scotia to New York. Dr. Kimball also said that looking at the current weather map, the climate is surprisingly similar to that measured in 1930 when Coste and Bellonte made their first east-to-west transatlantic flight. It is truly strange. At that time, Coste and Bellonte flew with the wind and circled through areas of high and low pressure to reach Curtiss Airfield. Now, Codos and Rossi are also in the same situation and can arrive with the wind. As for the speed of the two aviators, it is generally estimated that it was 200 kilometers per hour in the first 15 hours of flight. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>New York: According to a wireless message received here from the "Le Bourget" plane piloted by French aviators Codos and Rossi, the plane is requested to proceed as usual. The plane sends out messages at any time to notify the location it passes through. From this, it can be estimated that Codos and Rossi have flown over the border between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and at 5:20 AM local time, they flew over Halifax. The Bruner area of Newfoundland is known as the "North Atlantic Graveyard," and the climate is very harsh. Now, Codos and Rossi have flown over this area and are 965 kilometers away from New York. In the eastern United States, although they have a tailwind, a storm is rising in the rocky mountains, and it is a southwest wind, which is not conducive to flight. It is generally estimated that the average speed of the plane is now 165 kilometers per hour, and it will accelerate afterwards, as the gasoline in the plane is gradually decreasing. If they enter the United States from Lower Canada into Titroia, and then to San Diego, the distance is shorter than going through New York. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) The "Le Bourget" plane piloted by French aviators Codos and Rossi sent out a wireless message saying that the engine is not working well and may arrive in New York at 3:00 PM (Greenwich time). After arriving, it may stop moving forward, and it is not certain. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Boston: The French ship Champolion, which frequently communicates by wireless with French aviators Rossi and Codos, sent out a wireless short report stating that the two aviators plan to land at the Floyd Bennett Field in New York. This is where the two started their flight to Syria last year, setting a new record. The reason has not been explained. It is likely that the plane they are flying is not flying very well or that the weather is bad en route, and they are using too much fuel, so they may not be able to fly to the California coast. But in any case, if the two arrive safely in New York, their achievement should not be taken lightly. New York is preparing to give them a grand welcome. At 1:00 PM today, the two were clearly flying near the Massachusetts coast. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th) St. Louis: French aviator Mermoz, accompanied by three companions, began his long-distance flight across the South Atlantic today in the three-engine plane "Arc-en-Ciel," hoping to overtake the Zeppelin airship and reach Natal, Brazil. The plane took off at 3:00 PM this afternoon, hoping to overtake the German airship in the Atlantic sky in order to reach Brazil first. The Zeppelin airship departed from Germany at 7:30 PM on Saturday, and when the "Arc-en-Ciel" took off from the Paris airfield, it was 44 and a half hours behind the Zeppelin airship when it left the west coast of Africa.

<p>Because of the Increase in Bread Prices</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet authorities issued the following order: Due to frequent droughts and partial crop damage in the southern regions of the Soviet Union, grain market prices have increased, resulting in various consequences. This phenomenon has forced the People's Committee and the Central Committee of the Party to raise the excessively low prices of bread rations. The People's Committee and the Central Committee of the Party are aware that once bread ration prices increase, the situation of low-wage workers and employees will be difficult. Therefore, they ordered that from June 1, 95 million rubles per month be allocated to increase the monthly wages of low-wage workers and employees in the Soviet Union. This amount will require 665 million rubles by the end of this year. In addition, with the increase in social insurance funds allocated by the state due to the increase in wages, the total amount of monthly wage increases will be 107 million rubles, that is, a total increase of 749 million rubles by the end of the year.

He hoped that the steering committee would unanimously recommend to the General Commission to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and to demonstrate an unwavering determination to advance efforts to achieve a disarmament treaty. Henderson reviewed the recent trends in disarmament talks, mentioning the French memorandum of April 17. He noted that the French memorandum stated that France would immediately reduce its armaments, but could not agree to other countries immediately rearming. The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference is scheduled to meet tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 PM, at which time US Representative Davis and Russian Representative Litvinov will both speak.

<p>Restricting the Import of Fifty-Six Types of Goods</p>
<p>And Banning Japanese Ships from Docking</p>
<p>Osaka According to a dispatch from a certain source, the Dutch East Indies government is increasingly oppressing Japanese businesses. Proposals for import restrictions discussed between Japan and the Netherlands, apart from cotton products, include as many as fifty-six types of miscellaneous goods. At the same time, the extreme anti-Japanese attitude of the commercial company licensing system is being used to deal with negotiations. On the other hand, under the policy of favoring domestic ships, Japanese ships will be prohibited from docking at Balikpapan and one other port where South Seas mail ships dock. Therefore, if the above cases are realized, Japanese goods may not be able to maintain 30% of the current total trade volume of 150 million yuan, or it may be reduced to 15%, i.e., 20 to 30 million yuan, which is quite worrying. Even the Batavia system, which currently imports 50 million yuan from the Dutch East Indies to Japan, may be on the verge of crisis. (Electric Communication, 28th)</p>

<p>Prince Chichibu Scheduled to Depart</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Colonial Affairs, regarding the Brazilian restrictions on immigration, has been cooperating with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the Brazilian government to reconsider and is studying countermeasures. On the other hand, it is concentrating its main efforts on the Manchurian industrial immigration policy as a follow-up measure. After concrete negotiations with the Army, the Ministry of Finance, the Kwantung Army, the Kwantung Government, and the South Manchuria Railway, it plans to implement this fundamental policy starting next year. That is, the Manchurian Self-Defense Agricultural Immigration Plan, which has been trialed since 1932 (500 people per year), will end this year. From next year onwards, agricultural immigration plans of 500,000 people in 20 years, 200,000 people in 10 years, 100,000 people in 5 years, and 30,000 people per year will be established. The scope of agricultural immigration will be further expanded to include industrial, commercial, mining, and other industrial immigrants, so that groups can formally immigrate in order to develop the industries of Japan and Manchuria and increase the common welfare of the people. Various direct and indirect necessary institutions, such as immigration land companies and immigration associations merged by Japan and Manchuria, should be established in sequence.

<p>(Paris) Recently, those engaged in the business of military firearms have been extraordinarily prosperous. The Fokis Company has already received a large order from Japan. According to its report, the total profit in 1933 was US$1,005,785, while in 1932 it was only US$992,359. The dividend in 1933 was US$4.42, while in 1932 it was US$3.95. The company specializes in manufacturing machine guns and was founded by American Fokker. The current manager is Pannatt, who came from the US Navy. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e60">France Advocates Increasing Permanent Council Members of the League of Nations <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet Union, Poland, and Spain Each Get a Seat</p>
<p>The Number of Non-Permanent Council Seats Increased Simultaneously</p>
<p>(Paris) Recently, the rumor of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations has been rampant. If the Soviet Union joins the League of Nations, it will demand to obtain one of the permanent council seats of the Executive Council. Therefore, Poland will inevitably make the same request, making the resolution quite difficult. Recently, French Foreign Minister Barthou declared in the House of Representatives that this problem can be resolved by proposing a compromise solution. The method is to increase the number of permanent council seats of the Executive Council and increase the number of non-permanent council seats in the same proportion. In this way, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Spain can each obtain a permanent council seat. However, this method is expected to be opposed by Argentina or other member states. It is reported that France also intends to propose abolishing the permanent council seats when possible, but this reform plan is also afraid of encountering opposition from Italy and other parties. Therefore, according to general predictions here, the issue of the permanent council seats of the Executive Council is worthy of serious consideration by delegations from various countries. Although France has repeatedly guaranteed Poland and treated it with sincerity, Poland and Russia are competing for the leadership of the Slavic countries. If the League of Nations grants the Soviet Union a permanent council seat but withholds it from Poland, it will inevitably be unacceptable to Poland. Furthermore, it is not a good plan for the League of Nations to gain a new member state and lose another member state. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Navy Agree</p>
<p>But Hope Not to Discuss the Far East Issue</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of discussions between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy, Foreign Minister Hirota will submit a draft instruction to Ambassador Matsudaira in London to the Cabinet for approval tomorrow. It is reported that the Japanese government has expressed its appreciation for the British sincerity in disarmament and accepted the suggestion to open bilateral talks. Japan does not object to the convening of a general conference by the countries of the naval treaty at any time, if it is deemed appropriate. However, Japan firmly believes that the naval conference does not need to discuss the Nine-Power Treaty, the Far East issue, and political issues, as these matters have already been thoroughly discussed by the League of Nations. Therefore, the Japanese government firmly believes that the next naval conference will only discuss defense and naval power. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<p>The Situation After the Washington Conference Has Changed</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government has likely received a note from the British government, the content of which is probably the same as the note sent by Britain to the governments of Washington and Tokyo. In the note, the British government stated that according to the provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty, when the treaty expires in 1935, another naval conference should be convened. Now, Britain suggests that before the 1935 naval conference is convened, the countries concerned should first engage in preparatory talks. These talks will likely involve the exchange of opinions between the two sides of each country in accordance with normal diplomatic procedures, with London as the center of contact. If all the invited countries participate in these talks, then France does not seem to reject participation. According to general observations, in recent years, the scope of naval issues has expanded greatly. In addition to the old issues, several new issues have been added, such as the Soviet Union being recognized by most countries after the signing of the Washington Treaty. This fact is one of the new issues. Although the Soviet Union is not a signatory to the Washington Treaty, it has now been recognized by most countries, which is tantamount to joining the group of great powers. Although the current Soviet navy is very weak, it seems that the naval limitation treaty is unlikely to be implemented without the participation of the Soviet Union. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Rear Admiral Woodward of the Naval Department recently declared that the current situation in Europe and the rest of the world makes the cause of disarmament hopeless. He said, "Every time at an international conference, the United States always loses something. Under such circumstances, the only policy that the United States should adopt is to strengthen its military, sharpen its weapons, and urgently prepare for national defense to meet the needs of the times, and not to slack off in the slightest. The world situation is as we have witnessed it, and it is probably impossible for countries to abandon armaments. The United States has always supported the movement for sincere disarmament, but does not want to be drawn into the whirlpool of European political machinations."</p>
<p>British Bao Bicheng Overseas Dominion Minister Thomas delivered a speech on British Empire Day, stating briefly that Britain has always decided to fulfill the obligations that Britain has signed, but we must firmly express to the world that the only purpose we seek is peace. Regardless of how difficult the current environment is, what the London government is doing its best to maintain is peace. In some parts of the world, there are now various factors that are enough to create a situation that is more dangerous than before the Great War of 1914, but Britain, to the extent possible, is implementing disarmament. Britain's implementation of reducing armaments is almost reaching the limit of danger. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Non-official circles studying why Britain is promoting the preliminary talks of the 1935 naval disarmament conference today claimed to have learned the inside story as follows: Japan wanted to hold preliminary talks, but was unwilling to be the first to propose it because it was not sure of success. The United States also vaguely expressed its willingness to participate in these talks, but for the same reason, it was also unwilling to be the initiator. Non-official circles believed that British Foreign Secretary Simon had occasionally made an oral suggestion to the American Ambassador to Britain Bingham, saying that this time may be the most appropriate time to open negotiations. Unexpectedly, it was accepted by the United States. Once Simon said it, a team of horses could not catch up, so he had no choice but to invite Japan, France, Italy, and other countries to participate together. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from Ambassador Matsudaira in Britain on the 28th to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, British Foreign Secretary Simon had previously proposed the issue of convening a disarmament preliminary conference. British opinion circles are keeping silent and have not expressed any opinions. However, on the 26th, the London Times began to publish the following article, the content of which can be said to express the true intention of the British government regarding the preliminary conference, and is quite noteworthy: "The British government, in preparation for holding the 1935 naval conference, has proposed to various countries to hold a preliminary conference first. At this conference, it seems that only technical issues and procedural matters will be discussed, without discussing issues of policy or doctrine. The matters to be decided are the date and place of the meeting. Britain has sent proposals to Japan, the United States, France, Italy, and others, among which the United States has now expressed its consent to participate in the preliminary conference.

<p>Chen Zhaoying...Party Affairs in Fujian Province</p>
<p>Lin Sen...People's Livelihood</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9:00 AM on the 28th, the Central Government held the 132nd Memorial Week for the Premier, attended by Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Chen Zhaoying, Liu Shouzhong, Chen Ce, Deng Jiayan, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, and all staff, totaling about 600 people. Chairman Ye Chucang presided, and Chen Zhaoying reported on party affairs and the situation of suppressing bandits in Fujian Province, briefly stating that party affairs in Fujian Province were scattered during the previous rebellion of Chen Mingshu. After being ordered to go to the province, he actively reorganized while identifying 90 working comrades to work in various counties. However, due to a shortage of funds, the progress of establishing lower-level party branches and preparing for the provincial representative assembly was slightly slow. Now, having arrived in the capital, he specifically requested the Central Government to increase funding and establish a working outline so that there would be a basis for action. Furthermore, the suppression of bandits in Fujian Province has been very successful. The bandit areas have now been reduced to only five counties, and it is hoped that they can be cleared up in the short term. Although the situation in the province is special compared to other provinces, Chairman Chen has been able to cope with ease and take appropriate measures in Fujian. After the speech, the meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM. (Central News Agency, 28th)</p>

After Chairman Lin led the salute, he gave a speech, briefly stating that the Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood, from a broad perspective, is to enable all the people of the country to have their clothing, food, housing, and transportation needs resolved. Today, he will study with everyone from a narrow perspective, that is, the issue of personal clothing, food, housing, and transportation. At this time when the New Life Movement is being vigorously implemented throughout the country, our lives, every move, should never forget the four characters of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. This is the true new life. The ancients had people who would rather starve to death than lose their integrity, which is enough to prove that clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all related to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame.

<p>Special Telegram: Jardine Matheson received a telegram from Washington on the 26th, stating that, according to the most reliable sources, the silver issue will not have any practical results. The authorities are now opposed to any major monetary actions, fearing that this will increase the national debt. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation is gradually retreating to a defensible position. General sentiment is quite supportive of the management of various prices. The authorities are proceeding cautiously with the Securities Exchange Act. It is likely that the results of this case will not be as unsatisfactory as the opponents claim. US relief funds will gradually increase this summer, due to the undertaking of construction projects and revolving mortgage finance. It is expected that Congress will adjourn early.</p>

<p>The New Trend of Arms Race Among Nations</p>
<p>Soviet Union's Chemical Warfare Preparedness Emerges as a Force</p>
<p>Dark clouds are gathering over Europe, and everywhere there is the possibility of causing war. However, the reason why no unexpected disaster has occurred at present is not because the countries concerned do not want to take this opportunity to settle old scores, restore their declining economic strength, and break the status quo. It is only because they are all restricted by domestic factors. The economic panic has not yet been overcome, anti-war sentiment is still quite strong, and none of the countries themselves have a sure chance of winning. Therefore, at this time, no country dares to challenge lightly.</p>
<p>The European stalemate is doomed in this chaotic situation. Britain certainly does not need to argue about firmly grasping the helm of the European continent, but she cannot but be concerned about European affairs. The control of the world's commercial markets cannot be easily let go. Now the dominance of the navy and army seems to be a thing of the past. Although they still each occupy their own position, their importance has indeed gradually diminished. The emerging military force!! The air force is gradually becoming the focus of military affairs. Britain certainly does not want to fall behind in this regard. At present, the strength of the British air force is that the total number of squadrons in its domestic flight team is 75, and there are 23 squadrons overseas, including 13 fighter squadrons, 10 teams organized in coordination with the army and navy, 34 light bomber squadrons, 10 heavy bomber squadrons, 1 communications aircraft squadron, and 7 flying boat squadrons. The total number of aircraft incorporated into the squadrons is estimated to be about 1,500. The budget for the 1933 fiscal year was £19,638,600. The aviation personnel include 3,150 officers and 25,042 enlisted men. Furthermore, in view of the current tense situation in Europe and the deteriorating atmosphere in the Far East, it is necessary to have further plans. Therefore, the number of squadrons of British domestic aircraft will be expanded to 89, the number of personnel will be expanded to 40,000, and the number of aircraft will be increased to 2,072.</p>
<p>Britain is so focused on the expansion of the flight team. France, which is known as the world's number one air force, certainly does not want to be outdone. Her air force (except for a small number of naval air forces) has 35 fighter squadrons, 46 reconnaissance and observation squadrons, 9 light bomber squadrons, 18 heavy bomber squadrons, and 2 cover squadrons, totaling 110 squadrons. In addition, there are 18 balloon squadrons and 24 squadrons of overseas troops. The number of aircraft is about 3,000. The budget for the 1933 fiscal year was 16,904,130,000 francs. The personnel include 2,090 officers and 30,412 enlisted men. In the future, she will expand to 210 squadrons and increase to 5,900 aircraft. The European power second only to France, Italy, wants to compete with her for hegemony in the Mediterranean and wants to gain control in Central Europe. Therefore, Italy is also expanding its air force. Her current strength is 36 fighter squadrons, 28 reconnaissance squadrons, 31 bomber squadrons, 14 training squadrons, and 14 squadrons of unknown types, totaling 123 squadrons. In addition, there are two balloon squadrons. The air force organized in coordination with the army has four regiments. The air force strength in the colonies is outside. The number of aircraft is about 1,500. The budget for 1933-34 is 6,959,480,000 lira. Her air force personnel include 2,437 officers, 4,088 non-commissioned officers, and 25,029 soldiers. Her expansion plan has not yet found</p>
<p>concrete figures.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is a mysterious country in the world, especially its military organization, which has never been publicly announced. However, after her first five-year plan was quite successful, everyone knows that it contains extremely serious military implications. In January of this year, according to a certain expert's estimate, the Soviet Union's air force has 46 fighter squadrons, 87 reconnaissance squadrons, 46 bomber squadrons, and 31 attack and other squadrons, totaling 210 squadrons. In addition, there are 13 balloon squadrons and 32 naval aircraft squadrons. The total number of aircraft is about 3,000. Her chemical warfare preparedness is especially sufficient to show the characteristics of her air force.</p>
<p>The major European countries are making such efforts in air force preparation. As for the so-called arms reduction, everyone knows that it is just diplomatic rhetoric. (April 25th in London)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Prelude to Cooperation Between Japanese Political Parties Japan Correspondence <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>(The Last Gasp of Parliamentary Politics)</p>
<p>(The Sole Symbol of Warlord Autocracy)</p>
<p>Since the Japanese military instigated the September 18th Incident, exciting the passions of the general populace, the Japanese constitutional government and parliamentary discussions have not only been weak in themselves, but the military has also paid little attention to them, and the majority of the people have become weary of them. For example, the Seiyukai party, which held an absolute majority of 300 seats in the Diet, was unable to legally obtain power. Even after its leader was assassinated by an active-duty military officer, it took a year and a half before anyone dared to openly question it. This fully demonstrates the incompetence of the parliament and further proves that political parties without a financial background do not have the trust of the majority of the people.</p>
<p>The reason why Japanese parliamentary politics has been able to continue to this day is that, politically speaking, Japan has not completely broken away from feudal relations. Therefore, its elder statesmen still have considerable power in political actions. Although Prince Saionji Kinmochi does not have the same power in the military as Yamagata Aritomo, he has a special position in politics. He strongly advocates constitutional politics, believing that parliament is necessary no matter what. Therefore, the current situation can be temporarily maintained by Saitō, and the form of parliament can also exist. Furthermore, no matter how tyrannical the Japanese warlords are, and no matter how dissatisfied the young officers are, they are only dissatisfied with the people in power in the current government (in other words, the cabinet). There is no question about the entire system. In that case, as long as the current system is preserved, the parliamentary politics supported by capitalists will still have room to exist. Moreover, they still need them to manage finances.</p>
<p>The struggle between the financial groups and the warlords almost came to blows in the early spring of this year. Initially, the military retreated step by step, but later it launched a counterattack by using the issue of discipline. As a result, the political parties were utterly defeated. Now the military has a more solid and powerful new arrangement in military affairs. This arrangement is no weaker than that of the September 18th Incident, but it is not easy to determine when and what event will be used to launch it. Therefore, the financial groups are even more backward in comparison. The financial groups and those who support parliament have now decided to unite the Seiyukai and Minseitō parties, eliminate partisan disputes and personal emotional conflicts, and engage in what is called policy coordination. On the surface, they all say that after Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, there is a great trend of isolation in the international community, and at the same time, there is international economic competition and pressure on Japan in trade. However, in fact, although Japan's domestic economic life is showing a lively scene due to the stimulation of the military-industrial industry, those who benefit are only a very small minority. The general public is still groaning under the recession, and life is extremely difficult. For example, the former Chief Executive of Korea, Hiraoka Sadatarō, even went so far as to forge writings of Emperor Meiji to swindle money because he had no means of living. The plight of those in the middle and lower classes can be inferred from this. In such a torrent of life's difficulties, what the Japanese rulers (whether warlords or financial groups) fear most is the deterioration of ideology. In the past, in the era when there was more freedom of speech, there was always a group of people who tended to engage in legal movements. Now, although there are no obvious signs of major deterioration on the surface, in reality, reactionary organizations are developing very rapidly. Whether among industrial workers in cities, students in schools, tenant farmers and hired laborers in rural areas, there is extremely strong deterioration. Even the so-called various patriotic organizations on the right wing are certainly stubbornly conservative, but they are the same in wanting to break the status quo, and they often use violent means. Therefore, for their own survival, financial capitalists, on the one hand, help the warlords to advocate their extraordinary times theory, and at the same time, they want to find ways to consolidate their own position. Maintaining the existence of parliament is the most important step. Therefore, the political and civil parties are negotiating and paying special attention to the rice problem and the issue of ideological education.</p>
<p>The preliminary steps for cooperation between the political and civil parties are, in terms of technology: (1) The two parties take turns as chairman during meetings; (2) The time and place of the meeting are decided by the responsible persons of the two parties after consultation, and then communicated to the chairman, who notifies the attending representatives; (3) The content of the meeting will only be published publicly after both parties have consulted and believe that it can be published; (4) The secretaries-general of the two parties are responsible for this meeting.</p>
<p>This is the wonderful method that they believe is the most powerful and most capable of overcoming the current contradictions. It is also the result of Saionji's advocacy of maintaining constitutional politics after he arrived in Tokyo. However, it is a big question whether this kind of movement can achieve political results. As for a few large financial groups such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Furukawa, they may take this opportunity to expand their monopoly in Japan. They also have considerable confidence in extending it to the four northeastern provinces. However, these methods will never save Japan's urgent situation. If they want to expand overseas again, they will run into obstacles. Talking about winning with a majority in parliament and using members to subdue the warlords is simply like dreaming, because the Seiyukai already has an absolute majority of seats there. In short, the future development of the Japanese political situation, whether in diplomacy or military affairs, will be dominated by the warlords. At most, the financial groups will only be slightly larger vassals. Therefore, the conspiracies of the military should be given special consideration, and the trend of the Japanese political situation should be discerned from the actions of the military.

<p>(Soviet Russia Concentrates Forces to Fortify Defense)</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Recently, the war preparations of both Japan and Russia have become increasingly tense. The Japanese army is currently actively concentrating on the northern border of the Northeast.</p>
<p>The eastern line takes Tielinghe Station as its base camp, and more than 20,000 Japanese troops are stationed in Suifenhe. The western line takes Hailar as its base camp, and the number of troops stationed there is unknown, but they are still being transported. In addition, for the convenience of military transportation, the Japanese are also working hard to build railways from Dunhua to Dongning, from Mudanjiang via Mishan to Sanxing, and from Bei'an Town to Heihe. At the same time, the Russians have concentrated 140,000 troops, 400 aircraft, 300 tanks, 13 armored vehicles, and 12 submarines in Vladivostok between Manchuria and Vladivostok, and are still working hard to replenish them. As for our volunteer army, there are still more than 30,000 people near Mishan, and it is said that they are also receiving assistance from the Russian side. Therefore, although Japan and Russia have reopened discussions on the private sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, it is difficult to hope that they will not break down and thus lead to a final duel, judging from the situation of the military deployments of both sides.

<p>Liu Wenhui Offers Opinions on Resolving Sino-Tibetan Disputes</p>
<p>Ya'an Correspondence: Huang Musong, the special envoy dispatched by the National Government to pay respects to the Dalai Lama, passed through Ya'an, western Sichuan, on his way to Tibet via Sichuan and Kang. He met with Liu Wenhui, the commander-in-chief of the Sichuan-Kang Border Defense, and inquired about the recent situation of the disputes between Kang and Tibet, as well as his opinions on the future of resolving Sino-Tibetan disputes. Liu offered Huang detailed opinions based on the key points of his years of dealing with Tibet. His original words are as follows: "Since the second year of the Yongzheng reign of the late Qing Dynasty, the offices of chief and deputy resident ministers in Tibet were established. Throughout the Qing Dynasty, there was never a shortage of these officials. Therefore, during the period when Lian Yu and Zhang Yingtang were stationed in Tibet at the end of the Qing Dynasty, even though Britain and Russia made all kinds of plans for Tibet, and the Qing court and Lian Yu also took wrong measures, the Qing Dynasty's control over Tibet never lost its shape. Since the revolution, no senior official of the central government has personally set foot in Tibet. As a result, the relationship between China and Tibet has become increasingly estranged, and in fact, it has even become isolated. Now, the arrival of Envoy Huang in Tibet is truly the first of its kind in the twenty years of the Republic of China. Its significance is extremely great and can be called the first in the history of Sino-Tibetan relations in the Republican era. A new development of all Sino-Tibetan events and relations is rooted here. Now that I have passed through Ya'an, and you have inquired about my humble views, Wenhui's responsibility lies in offering my meager advice.</p>
<p>First, regarding the Sino-Tibetan issue, from the perspective of its historical evolution, the Sino-Tibetan relationship began with the marriage of Princess Wencheng in the early Tang Dynasty and ended with the Tang Dynasty, which was the golden age of Tibet. China and Tibet were nephew and uncle states. The Song Dynasty paid tribute respectfully and was subordinate without doubt. The Yuan Dynasty especially revered Tibetan monks, and governed the area as a province. They treated them with kindness and bestowed upon them the honorific titles of Dharma King and National Preceptor, and allowed them to be hereditary. Therefore, throughout the Ming Dynasty, there were no Tibetan troubles. Until the Qing Dynasty, the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong emperors used both kindness and authority to deal with Tibet, which was very harmonious. Therefore, the territory and sovereignty of Tibet have belonged to us from the beginning. The historical facts are clear and obvious. From the perspective of disputes, since Britain conquered India in the twenty-first year of the Qianlong reign, Warren Hastings and Samuel Turner entered Tibet. From the fifteenth year of the Jiaqing reign, emissaries who secretly explored Tibet were sent to Tibet constantly, which laid the roots of the Sino-Tibetan issue. Later, it gradually evolved into all the outstanding issues of today. In the twenty-eighth year of the Guangxu reign, the Qing court even considered concluding a secret treaty with Russia regarding Tibet. Since the British invaded Tibet and engaged in negotiations with us, the treaties that have been documented began with the "Chefoo Convention" in the second year of the Guangxu reign, followed by the "Sino-British Burma Convention" in the twelfth year of the Guangxu reign, the "Indo-Tibetan Convention" in the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign, the "Calcutta Indo-Tibetan Convention" in the nineteenth year of the Guangxu reign, and the "Tibet-India Supplementary Convention" concluded by Tang Shaoyi and the British envoy Satow in the thirty-third year of the Guangxu reign (the "Anglo-Tibetan Convention" of the thirtieth year of the Guangxu reign was attached to this convention). In the "Anglo-Russian Entente" of the thirty-third year of the Guangxu reign, there were also provisions regarding Tibet. Since the Republic of China, there have been protests by the British envoy Sir John Jordan in the first year of the Republic, and our reply. In the second year of the Republic, there was the "Mongolian-Tibetan Treaty" under the manipulation of Britain and Russia, and the extremely important Simla Conference also began in that year. In February of the third year of the Republic, Britain suddenly proposed a new proposal to divide Inner and Outer Tibet. In April, the conference ended, and Chen Yifan signed a draft treaty without authorization. On May 1st, the government issued a telegram rejecting it. The Simla Conference thus broke down. Since then, there have been four more negotiations: one during the era when Yuan Shikai was brewing the imperial system in the fourth year of the Republic, the second during the declaration of war against Germany in the sixth year of the Republic, the third was the "Rongba Chaqia Armistice Agreement" concluded by Chen Xialing in the seventh year of the Republic, which had a term of one year. Therefore, in May of the eighth year of the Republic, the British envoy urged the negotiations very urgently, because they believed that the term of the Chen Agreement had expired. The fourth was the Nine-Power Treaty of the Washington Conference, which respected China's sovereignty and eliminated the provisions regarding special regions in China. In fact, this was in extreme conflict with the British policy towards Tibet, but its actual effect was equal to zero. In the twentieth year of the Republic, the Dabai Incident was fortunately resolved by the central government's power and the bravery of the soldiers, who drove the Tibetan army to the west bank of the Jinsha River and signed the "Gangtuo Agreement," which is probably the most recent treaty between China and Tibet. In general, the course of the Sino-Tibetan issue is extremely complex, and can be divided into different scopes: A. External, which involves Britain, India, Russia, and Mongolian Tibet, and it is not yet known whether it will involve Japan and Manchuria in the near future. B. Domestic, which involves Kang Tibet, Qing Tibet, and Yunnan Tibet. However, these two items also have mutual influences and involvements, but their main points are actually different. To put it bluntly, those belonging to item A, if you want to solve it, the parties involved are not only China and Tibet, but the issues involved are unusually heavy. Those belonging to item B are centered on the Kang Tibet dispute. According to the current situation, it is up to the central government to preside over it, and the neighboring provinces cooperate with it. No matter what method is adopted, it seems not difficult to achieve considerable results. After consultation and decision, we can then plan the negotiations of item A. According to my personal humble opinion, it may be smoother.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the Kang Tibet issue, the key to resolving the Kang Tibet dispute lies first in the border issue. According to the late Qing Dynasty's efforts to pass through the area, the Zhao brothers were appointed to govern Sichuan and Kang respectively. Zhao Erfeng relied on strong support and handled the matter freely. First, he laid the foundation for the territory. The methods he adopted were no more than three: 1. Forcing the Tusi to change to a flowing official system; 2. Conquering the wild Fan and making them surrender; 3. Recovering the Qing court's local areas. His power reached Jiangda, and he took Danta Mountain as the boundary with Tibet. Then Zhao was transferred to the position of Sichuan governor, and Fu Songqiu replaced him. He was planning to implement the establishment of a province, but the Republic of China was established, and the political situation changed. It was not completed. At that time, the Dalai Lama was in exile in India and took advantage of the opportunity to return to Tibet with the help of Britain, and launched a large-scale internal invasion, which even fell to Ba'an Lihua. Cai Songpo Yin Changheng was ordered to send troops and defeated the Tibetan army greatly, and recovered the old territory. After that, it failed again. Since then, those guarding the border have not been focused on the border. Not only could they not plan to recover it, but they also planned to establish a province to shield Sichuan and consolidate national defense. They even retreated to Ganzi and concluded the Rongba Chaqia Agreement, which aroused the Tibetan side's contempt and made the mad claim to advance to the South Bridge of Qiongzhou. In the twenty-first year of the Republic and this year, the two internal invasions were fortunately unsuccessful. Now that the Dalai Lama has passed away, the special envoy is coming west. This is probably a good opportunity to resolve the Kang Tibet border issue. As for the way to resolve it, from the perspective of its historical evolution, Danta Mountain should be the boundary. Secondly, from the perspective of the situation, the area of ​​Xikang should at least be extended to west of Changdu, because it can defend if retreating, and support if advancing by connecting Qing and Dian. But according to the current facts, if Tibet sincerely surrenders to the central government, then based on the meaning of the five ethnic groups being one family, reducing diplomatic difficulties, avoiding Tibetan suspicion and fear, in the situation of making all kinds of concessions, two benchmarks can be drafted:</p>
<p>1. According to the previous Qing Dynasty Tibetan settlement, all the land under the jurisdiction of the Hutuktu should be given to Tibet, because the jurisdiction and succession of the Hutuktu all belong to the resident minister in Tibet. In this way, Zhala Gongjue Changdu should all belong to Tibet. All the land under the jurisdiction of the Tusi should all belong to Kang, because the jurisdiction and succession of the Tusi all belong to the Sichuan Governor. In this way, the counties of Yanjing Jiangka Sanyan Baiyu Tongpu Dige Dengke Shiqu should all be returned to Kang according to their original jurisdiction. 2. Temporarily rely on the Gangtuo Agreement, starting from the lower reaches of the Jinsha River south of Wucheng, and going upstream to Dengke, all the east and west banks should be the Kang Tibet border line, and the original jurisdiction of the counties on the east bank that are on the west bank should still be returned to the old system. As for Yanjing County, which belongs to Kang's jurisdiction, the headquarters also appointed a county magistrate. After the Gesang Rebellion, it temporarily belonged to Gongga's autonomy. Now that Gongga has passed away, his will also sent representatives to request that the headquarters recover it. Now, because the Tibetan side has the Jiangka Rebellion, the headquarters has not sent troops to take over for the sake of avoiding their doubts. Its final return to Kang is a natural trend. However, if you want to take the above path, there must be a prerequisite, that is, the central government must have a solid grasp of Tibet. If Changdu does not belong to the territory of Xikang, then the gateway to Xikang will be wide open, and the key to border defense will not be available. If China and Tibet do not become one family, and Kang Tibet does not truly blend together, then if the Tibetan border is attacked by foreign invaders one day, Kang will also find it difficult to defend itself.

<h3 id="e107">Fujian Province Reorganizes Security Regiments <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Qian Goes to Jiangxi to Request Instructions on Everything</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Security Office, considering that the local militias in the upper and lower counties not only lacked supplies and training, but also levied taxes on the spot and arrested people arbitrarily, which was deeply harmful to society, especially requested and obtained the approval of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to reorganize them all into security regiments for the sake of control. A total of fifteen regiments were established, requiring more than 300,000 yuan of military pay per month. However, even though these people have been enlisted, their wild nature is still difficult to tame. Incidents of disobeying orders and disturbing the people still occur from time to time. Some time ago, Chen Yucai, the fourth regiment stationed in Quanzhou, and Lin Jing, the seventh regiment stationed in Xingzhou, were disarmed by the Southern District Security Sub-Office for resisting troop transfers. After the mutinous soldiers escaped, many became bandits. Recently, the bandit atmosphere in the border area of Fuqing, Yongtai, and Minhou counties has become very strong. They have surrounded and seized regimental weapons, burned civilian houses, and kidnapped men and women, which was done by Lin Jing's remnants. The Security Office has repeatedly received reports from the county governments, requesting that troops be sent to suppress them. The office believes that the recent successive changes in the security regiments are due to some bad soldiers who are difficult to restrain and take risks, and half of them are also due to the old militia leaders who have been quiet for too long and miss action, colluding with their former troops and plotting wrongdoing. Currently, it has ordered the regiments to strictly eliminate bad soldiers to avoid affecting the entire regiment. It will improve the treatment of pure and good elements to reassure their minds. It will pay special attention to the actions of lower-level cadres such as platoon leaders. Those who dare to rebel and become bandits will be relentlessly suppressed. Those former militia leaders who behave improperly will also be investigated separately. In addition, Xiao Qian, the deputy director of the Security Office, took a boat to Shanghai on the 20th and then went to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the current situation of the security team and request instructions on reorganization matters. He will probably return to the province in about two weeks. The security regiment will undergo a reorganization, or a re-establishment and downsizing, and another deputy commander will be set up to assist in training, with the aim of becoming an elite force.

<h3 id="e108">Statistics on National Local Public Bonds <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>(Total Amount of More Than 20.4 Million)</p>
<p>(The 21st Army of Sichuan Issues the Most)</p>
<p>Beijing News: In recent years, financial resources have been exhausted. Whenever provincial and municipal governments encounter something to do and face financial difficulties, they issue public bonds as the only solution. Over the years, the numbers are staggering. This kind of method greatly hinders rural revitalization. At the end of last year, the Rural Revitalization Committee sent a telegram to all people's organizations across the country, ordering them to report the details of local land tax surcharges and exorbitant taxes, so that they could be rectified. Reports have been successively submitted to the meeting. At the same time, they also received very detailed information on the issuance of public bonds by local governments, as well as the types and names of these bonds. The committee has sent them to the National Financial Conference for reference. It is reported that there have been as many as 61 types of local public bonds issued by provinces and cities since 1927. Among them, there are 51 types of provincial public bonds and 10 types of municipal public bonds. The total amount of provincial public bonds is more than 18.7 million yuan, and the total amount of municipal public bonds is more than 1.7 million yuan, totaling more than 20.4 million yuan. In terms of provinces, the 21st Army of Sichuan issued the most, with a total of 12 types issued since 1930, totaling 48.2 million yuan. Other provinces (Jiangxi) had 8 million yuan of financial treasury bonds for reorganization, 40,000 yuan of short-term treasury bonds with interest added for circulation, and recently issued two more types, one is the Yuping Railway Public Bond of 12 million yuan, and one is the Road Construction Circulation Bond of 4 million yuan, with a total issuance amount of 24.4 million yuan, most of which has not yet been repaid. (Anhui) The Anhui Provincial Public Bond, issued in recent years, is the short-term public bond for the construction of highways, issued in 1929 and continued in 1931, with a total of more than 560,000 yuan. In 1932, interest-bearing treasury bonds of 500,000 yuan were issued again. In the spring of 1933, the Sheyu Road Public Bond of 500,000 yuan was issued. (Zhejiang) Since 1928, there have been seven types of construction public bonds, etc., with a total amount of more than 30 million yuan. (Hubei) The Hubei Provincial Public Bond, issued in recent years, includes the two types of Hubei Xiaoshanhou Public Bond in 1931 and 1932, totaling 6 million yuan. (Hunan) Hunan Province issued two types of public bonds in the past year, namely the Hunan Provincial Public Bond (formerly known as the National Salvation Loan) and the Hunan Provincial Construction Public Bond. The former has an issuance amount of 5 million yuan, and the latter has an issuance amount of 10 million yuan. (Jiangsu) The provincial public bonds issued by Jiangsu in recent years, in addition to the silk industry short-term public bond jointly issued with Zhejiang, issued a construction public bond of 7 million yuan in 1930, but there are still many previous public bonds that have not been repaid. Other provinces such as Hebei also have public bonds issued. (28th)</p>

<p>Lu Zhihuan, a resident of Ninguiren, Tonghui Road, near Huinong Bridge, is 44 years old and works as a handyman at the Zizai Baoxin Rice Mill. His wife, Chen, is 32 years old and also works as a female worker at the Ganshen Silk Factory. He has a son and a daughter, and the relationship between the husband and wife is not bad. Unexpectedly, three years ago, Chen became acquainted with Jia Yaoting, who used to be the squad leader of the merchant corps patrol team and a police officer of the Second Branch. At first, the two sides were quite secretive. In December of last year, Jia managed to move upstairs to Lu's house. On the surface, he was his neighbor, but secretly he continued to commit adultery with Chen. The matter was discovered by her husband, Lu Zhihuan, who could not help but be jealous. The two sides often had quarrels. On the evening of the 27th, at about 10 o'clock, Zhihuan and Yaoting had another dispute over a trivial matter. Unexpectedly, Yaoting's murderous intention suddenly arose. He immediately took a kitchen knife and slashed at Zhihuan indiscriminately. Zhihuan's head, arms, waist, and other parts of the body were cut more than ten times, covered in blood, and the wounds were as deep as an inch. He was extremely painful and fainted at once, and fell to the ground, unconscious. Zhihuan's father, Hengfang, saw that his son was being slashed and stepped forward to try to restrain Yaoting, causing his left hand to be slashed. Later, after someone reported it to the nearby patrol police, the adulterer Jia Yaoting and the adulterous woman Lu Chen were taken to the jurisdiction of the Sixth Public Security Bureau and transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation. At the same time, someone carried the injured man to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, and his life was in danger.</p>

<p>Qian Shunjin, a resident of Guangqin Road, along with two female workers from a silk factory, went to see the Nan Shui Xian Temple memorial celebration in the city the day before yesterday (the 26th). On their way home, near the Railway Hotel, several foundry workers approached them, and a verbal dispute arose. Qian Shunjin, sensing trouble, fled into the Number One Theater for temporary refuge. The workers mistakenly believed Qian Shunjin to be an employee of the theater and stormed in. After being dispersed by others, the workers, enraged, turned their anger towards the theater. Yesterday (the 27th) at around 9 PM, over a hundred workers caused trouble at the theater. Gu, a special agent from the police headquarters, along with other police officers, arrested three ringleaders and took them in for questioning. The crowd dispersed. However, at around 1 AM that night, another two to three hundred foundry workers gathered over two hundred hooligans, broke into the Number One Theater, destroying everything they encountered and beating everyone they saw. The theater's equipment, stage scenery, electric lights, and electric fans were all smashed to pieces, and the crowd dispersed in chaos. The total loss is estimated at five to six thousand yuan. Li Laowu, the theater manager, has already submitted reports to the county and provincial authorities, requesting a strict investigation. Yesterday (the 28th), all the foundry workers in the city went on strike in support of those who had been detained, expanding the situation and causing considerable local anxiety. The authorities have already ordered the police to secretly arrest and deal with the several ringleaders of the strike.</p>

<p>Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, arrived in Changzhou on the 27th, accompanied by Shen Qi, Director of the Highway Administration, to inspect the Wujin section of the Zhencheng Road. They then conferred with the county government on all relevant matters. Regarding the city ring road, Shi Ziquan, the third section chief of the county government, presented the planned route and the difficulties of traversing the city. After a lengthy discussion, it was generally agreed that if the car road did not connect the east-west horizontal streets within the city, a clear divide would form between urban and rural transportation. Ultimately, Director Shen believed that cars passing through the city were essential for boosting the market and facilitating travel. After the discussion, he immediately took a car from Wenzai Gate to the railway station, observing the actual conditions of the city houses along the way. He considered the road to be much wider than Rong Lane in Wuxi and believed that after minor adjustments and demolitions, it could be opened to traffic. He instructed County Magistrate Cai and Section Chief Shi to plan and implement the project immediately, hoping to see its early completion.</p>

Yesterday (the 26th) afternoon, a vagrant named Xing Lanzheng went to the Dasheng Newspaper and claimed to the newspaper's employee, Zhang Yanong, that people from other provinces would come to destroy the newspaper on the 27th. I tried to dissuade them, leading to a verbal dispute with Zhang and causing injuries. I immediately appealed to the county for investigation and interrogation. Xing Lanzheng is charged with colluding with people from other provinces to cause trouble, disrupt public order, and spread rumors. The verdict is scheduled for the 28th.</p>

<p>Gaogui Township in the tenth district of the county is located near barren marshes, making it a hideout for bandits. Banditry has been frequent in recent years, and the villagers have often been ravaged. Last winter, villagers such as Gao Kunshan, unable to bear the harassment, initiated the gathering of over a hundred villagers and equipped them with over fifty firearms, forming a local militia for self-defense. The day before yesterday, a gang of over thirty bandits, each carrying long guns and box cannons, arrived from the marshes with great momentum, intending to loot the township. Dong Er, a villager, spotted them and fired a warning shot. The local militia responded by firing together. After two hours of intense fighting, the bandits, unable to withstand the pressure, began to flee southeast.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Finance Minister Kong Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Discusses Exceptionally Successful Financial Conference; Regulations to be Enacted to督促Implementation <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Deputy Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, presided over the National Financial Conference in Beijing, which closed the day before yesterday (the 27th). Kong arrived in Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai night express train at 7 AM yesterday. He went to his private residence on Xihams Road for a brief rest. At around 10 AM, he went to the Central Bank on the Bund to work. In the afternoon at 4 PM, after attending the Central Bank Board of Directors meeting, he met with reporters from various newspapers. Excerpts of Kong's remarks are as follows: (Question) What are your thoughts on this Financial Conference? (Answer) At the beginning of this Financial Conference, with the financial chaos and tax revenue depletion in various provinces and cities, the people of the country were deeply concerned that the problems discussed at this conference would not be resolved satisfactorily. I was also quite doubtful. However, after the conference began, financial officials from remote cities came to attend the meeting despite the hardship. Over the course of seven days, more than one hundred cases were resolved. From beginning to end, they worked tirelessly. The most important financial issues at present, such as land registration, farmland consolidation, abolishing miscellaneous taxes, and compiling budgets, were thoroughly discussed. The implementation measures can be carried out by the financial authorities after the conference, according to the agreed-upon plan, one by one.</p>
<p>This will eliminate the previous problems of decisions being made without action or action without completion. I am exceptionally pleased with the successful outcome of this conference and the enthusiasm of the members. I feel that there are still solutions for the future of national finance. (Question) Are there any reward regulations for provinces and cities that implement the resolutions of the Financial Conference? (Answer) Rewards and punishments are the great tools of national governance. All cases resolved at this Financial Conference should be strictly ordered to be implemented by the financial authorities of each province and city, who will be held responsible. Those with excellent results will be rewarded, and those who do not implement them effectively will be punished. The Ministry of Finance will formulate regulations, submit them to the Executive Yuan, and then to the National Government for approval and implementation. (Question) How will the crackdown on prize-linked savings be carried out? What steps will be taken regarding the Sino-French Wan Guo Two Associations? (Answer) Although the crackdown on prize-linked savings was discussed at this conference, this matter is significant and involves complex issues. The Ministry will conduct in-depth research to ensure the best possible handling. (Question) When the business tax is implemented, if the provinces and cities still object due to foreign enclaves, will the national merchants also be delayed to show uniformity? (This includes special circumstances such as Shanghai, where Chinese and foreigners are mixed together.) (Answer)</p>
<p>The state collects taxes, and the people have the obligation to pay them. The implementation of the business tax requires national merchants to bear this tax obligation. As for provinces and cities with foreign concessions, at a time when our extraterritorial rights have not been fully recovered, foreign nationals may object and not want to pay this tax.</p>
<p>The government should negotiate with justice, and there will be solutions in the future. However, we can never delay the implementation of the tax for Chinese stores because foreigners object, resulting in a lack of tax revenue. (Question) The stamp tax and liquor license tax have been resolved to be prioritized for local financial income, which shows that the central government is sympathetic to the financial difficulties of local governments. However, how will the central government's financial income be compensated as a result of this slight shortfall? (Answer) The allocation of the above two taxes to local governments represents the central government's sympathy for local governments and the cooperation between the central and local governments. Previously, these two taxes belonged to the national tax, and the management was not perfect, and the tax revenue was not prosperous. Now that they have been allocated to the local governments, it is their responsibility to strictly eliminate tax evasion and increase tax revenue. It is hoped that proper consolidation will enrich local tax revenue, providing great assistance to local construction and solving local financial problems. The central government's finances will also be managed without effort. There is no distinction between the central and local governments. As for saving unnecessary expenses and opening up sources of income, those in charge of the central finance should have an overall plan. (Question) Can it be expected that all provinces and cities will fully comply with the implementation of local budgets starting in the second half of the year? (Answer) The purpose of this conference is to be feasible. Although local governments in our country have had budgets in the past, many are incomplete. Now that it has been resolved, the implementation of local budgets starting in the second half of the year must be followed. (Question) Wang Yitang is preparing to go to Japan to restore the Huì Yè Bank. If this is true, how will the government respond? (Answer) I have not heard of Wang's preparations to restore the Huì Yè Bank and cannot comment.</p>

<h3 id="e123">City Chamber of Commerce and Eleven Other Organizations Host Banquet for the Panchen Lama Last Night; Chairman Wang Xiaolai Delivers Welcome Speech; Wishing Him to Relieve Western Concerns After Returning to Tibet <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Since completing the Kalachakra initiation ceremony in Hangzhou, the Panchen Lama has come to Shanghai for a short stay of ten days before going to Beijing to discuss returning to Tibet. The city's public organizations, recognizing the Panchen Lama's ten years of support for the central government, harmonizing border affairs, and striving for unification, hosted a banquet at the City Chamber of Commerce last night at 7 PM, to fulfill the duties of the host. Over a hundred people attended. Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, and the Panchen Lama rose to respond. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Venue Decoration)</p>
<p>A yellow colored archway was erected at the entrance of the City Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace, with the words "Welcome" illuminated by electric lights. A yellow banner reading "Shanghai Public Organizations Welcome the Panchen Lama" was hung below. Banners were also hung at the two gates. Yellow silk ribbons were hung at the entrance on the ascent to the second floor, and yellow silk was hung on the third floor, creating a solemn atmosphere.</p>
<p>(List of Attendees)</p>
<p>The organizations represented at last night's banquet were the City Chamber of Commerce, Local Coordination Association, General Labor Union, Securities Industry Association, Chinese Jisheng Association, Chinese Moral Association, Chinese Red Cross Society, World Red Swastika Society, Shanghai South District Firefighting Federation, Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, and eleven other organizations. Over one hundred people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Huang Renzhi, Wang Yansong, Fang Jiaobo, Lao Jingxiu, Zhu Xuefan, Ye Jiaxing, and Mao Zhijian. Those accompanying the Panchen Lama included Senben Kanbu, Da Zhuoni Kanbu, Dafu Kanbu, Xia Kanbu, Renci, Luo, Director of Military Affairs Youren, Zhao Zhuoni, Qi Zhuoni Sangdan, Director Zhu Deshan, Deputy Director of Military Affairs Luo Tudan, Zhu Zanba Maqingbu, and Zhu Zanba SudeBa.</p>
<p>(Chairman's Speech)</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Lama Buddha, esteemed guests, it is an honor for our association to have the Panchen Lama grace us with his presence today. China and Tibet have the closest relationship. Since Emperor Taizong of Tang married Princess Wencheng to Tubo Yezong Nongzan in the fifteenth year of Zhenguan (641 AD), there has been a history of one thousand two hundred and ninety-four years. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the five races have been one family, and the relationship between China and Tibet has become even more intense. This time, the Master sponsored the Kalachakra initiation ceremony in Hangzhou, promoting the true meaning of Buddhism. Our admiration for the Master has become even brighter and more upright. Today, the Master is returning to Beijing from Shanghai and will return to Tibet to preside over political and religious affairs. This is not only unanimously welcomed and supported by the Tibetan compatriots, but we also feel joy and encouragement. We deeply hope that the Master will preside over the Tibetan government as soon as possible. The Master's personality, qualifications, scholarship, and doctrines are enough to make people sincerely and wholeheartedly submit. The national compatriots are eagerly awaiting the early establishment of Tibetan government on track and coordination with the intentions of the Central Government, and are paying attention to it day and night. The Chinese nation is known as five races, but geographically, historically, and genetically, it has long been mixed into one. Now, although the compatriots in the Northeast have fallen under iron hooves and are suffering oppression, the Central Government still has the strength to slowly deal with it and gradually seek recovery, establishing a comprehensive plan to deal with the aggressors. Tibet is more than three thousand miles from east to west and more than a thousand miles from north to south, making it the highest plateau in the world. Its abundant resources and vast area make it an important western border of our country. Strong neighbors surround it, and the people's livelihood is not stable. This is why the whole country is deeply worried. Therefore, the security of Tibet is a major issue for the whole country that cannot be ignored. The Master has been a member of the Central Political Committee for many years and deeply understands the principles of the General and the intentions of the Central Government. The accompanying staff also understand the overall situation and are outstanding. Recently, Heaven has favored us, and the campaign flag points west. From now on, the Central Government will have no worries about the west, and the compatriots will be able to enjoy peace and happiness. Chinese culture can cross the Hengduan Mountains and spread throughout Tibet. Construction and transportation can cross the snow-capped mountains and the Yarlung Tsangpo River, and progress by land, sea, and air. This trip is something we can rely on. This is what we deeply hope for the Master, in addition to admiration. Lama Buddha, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai City General Labor Union, Shanghai City Securities Industry Association, China Jisheng Association, China Moral Association, Shanghai China Red Cross Society, World Red Swastika Society, Shanghai Hunnan District Fire Rescue League, Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association, Shaoxing</p>
<p>Shanghai Local Coordination Association of Seven Counties and other organizations."</p>
<p>(Panchen's Response)</p>
<p>"Today, I am very honored to be hosted at the City Chamber of Commerce by various organizations. I have made no contribution to the country, and I am very grateful for your kind hospitality. China and Tibet have a long history, and they have a great relationship with China in terms of religion and politics. Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen's successful revolution, the five races have been one family, and the relationship between China and Tibet has become even closer. Although we are now suffering from foreign aggression everywhere, as long as we follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, unite, and unite the five races into one family, we can become stronger and stronger day by day. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will is very great, and we are willing to accept it with great enthusiasm and strive to implement it politically and religiously. However, I ask myself that I have limited ability and am ashamed of not being able to make any achievements, but I am very willing to use political power and religious power to work hard to promote the Three People's Principles and make China and Tibet more intimate (now I want to go back to Beijing and</p>
<p>Discuss with the Central Government the policy of governing Tibet after the death of the Dalai Lama, so that I can return early and put Tibetan politics on track to live up to your expectations, and I hope everyone will give me guidance at any time.)" After the Panchen Lama finished his speech, he raised his glass to toast the guests. At 9:30, the host and guests dispersed in joy.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Gu Yubo, Lin Kanghou, and Others Established Daxin Industrial Bank; Basic Capital of One Million Yuan; All Shares Fully Subscribed; Grand Opening in September <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Gu Yubo, the Chinese manager of the insurance department of the China Business Company, gathered financial giants Lin Kanghou, Yu Zuoting, Xu Jichin, Qian Chengxu, and others in April of this year to launch a large-scale bank, named Daxin Industrial Bank, with a capital fund of one million yuan, fully paid up at one time. The preparations are now nearing completion. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Origin of Establishment: The origin of the establishment of Daxin Industrial Bank is rooted in the fact that since the winds of economic recession in Europe and the United States have spread across the globe, the economic aggression of the powers against our country has intensified. Looking back at our country, banditry has not been eliminated, internal strife is frequently heard, and natural disasters 灾 and man-made calamities are intertwined. Others scheme against us in such a way, while our own lack of vigor is such that the national economy is becoming increasingly dire. Thus, cash is concentrated in the cities, while the countryside is on the verge of bankruptcy. Because of the bankruptcy of the countryside, the decline of all industries is accelerated. If this continues, the future crisis is truly unspeakable. To remedy this, passively, obstacles must be removed to reduce the burden on the people, and actively, resources must be pooled to jointly plan economic construction. However, in terms of construction, it is imperative to discern the urgency and divide the steps. In the past, agricultural products could be directly transported and sold in cities, and banks could regulate their finances. But now that the countryside is on the verge of bankruptcy, its agricultural products are unable to be transported and are stagnating, which has a huge impact on the cities. The way to remedy this lies in the banks penetrating deep into the countryside, assisting them, and seeking the improvement of the countryside, which is the most urgent task at present. In addition, developing inland resources and studying Northwest affairs are also the wishes of this bank. However, at the beginning of the establishment, it is felt that the resources are weak, but if we can approach it with perseverance, then who knows if the Northwest cause will not progress from research work to actual development? (The following is omitted) Northwest Support: Daxin Industrial Bank was initiated by Mr. Gu Yubo, and twenty-seven financial figures in Shanghai, including Lin Kanghou, Chen Liting, Zheng Hongnian, Qian Chengxu, Shen Jingzhong, Fan Dusheng, Shao Daren, and Chen Yaonan, all unanimously joined as founders. Mr. Gu personally went to Mr. Yu Youren to express his opinions on this matter, which was deeply appreciated by President Yu. Yu Zuoting, Xu Jichin, Jiang Baili, Tang Haian, Xu Fu, and others all unanimously served as supporters. Mr. Gu, in view of the urgency of developing the Northwest, specially telegraphed the Northwest authorities and consulted back and forth, which has received the full support of the Northwest authorities. He specially telegraphed Mr. Fan Dusheng, an important figure in the Northwest, to go south to participate in the preparations. Mr. Fan has arrived in Shanghai and has been in contact with Mr. Gu for several days, progressing smoothly. The preparatory office has been set up at No. 302, Guohua Building.</p>
<p>Subscription of Shares: The bank is a joint-stock limited company, with a capital of one million yuan temporarily set. Seven-tenths have been subscribed by the founders, and three-tenths have been subscribed by the Northwest side. Therefore, the basic capital of one million yuan has been fully subscribed. The head office will be established in Shanghai, and branches will also be established in important commercial ports of various provinces. Its business includes deposits, loans, remittances, discounts, foreign exchange, buying and selling securities, and safe deposit boxes, as well as savings. The shares are divided into one hundred yuan per share, with a total of ten thousand shares. Shareholders with more than thirty shares may be elected as directors, and shareholders with more than ten shares may be elected as supervisors. The collection of shares will be handled by the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Women's Bank, the Shanghai Municipal Bank, and Hengxun, Yichang, and other money shops, from May 20th to the end of July, as the share payment period. The official opening is scheduled for September. The location of the head office is approximately on Nanjing Road.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway transports spring cocoons from Zhejiang, which are usually transported by the Huitong Transport Company. This year's spring cocoons from Zhejiang have all been put on the market, with Chang'an being the earliest. Yesterday, the first batch of spring cocoons was transported from Chang'an Station by the Huitong Company on behalf of the cocoon merchants Tongji Xie, Changyu, Jin Shaoji, and others, totaling 420 packages. They belonged to the Shanghai factories Fuchang, Yutai, Yucheng, and Yuan. Yesterday, 60 hemp bags of spring cocoons were also transported from Xucun Station, and 118 packages of spring cocoons were transported by Tongji Xie. All arrived at the South Station, unloaded from the train, and were sent to their respective destinations by the Huayun Yang Che Company.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Summary of Dangerous Riverbank Projects in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Last year, the China Relief Society jointly organized the Fuyou and Dayou major work relief projects in Jiangxi with the China Morality Society. The Relief Society also jointly organized the Jiangxi Nanchang Guangfeng Weiju Dike Project with the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society and the Morality Society, including the construction of water gates and the construction of the Wanshe Bridge. The Weiju Dike project used more than 70,000 yuan in relief funds. According to reports from the dike directors Huang Wenzhi and others of Gan Province, the Xihu Dike in Gan Province is the most important dike in the province and is of great importance. Although it is now well-built, there are many dangerous areas. The most dangerous areas have been built and collapsed repeatedly in the past, which can serve as a lesson. To make it permanent, it is necessary to stack boulders along the base of the dike to provide protection. The conference has great merits and virtues, and it is proposed to specially maintain it, select dangerous areas to purchase stones and stack them, so as to resist wind and waves and achieve lasting peace. The Weiju Dike is a very large and dangerous project in Nanchang, Jiangxi. Stacking boulders is to prevent water surges and wind waves. The association previously sent Director Li Yunmen to investigate and estimate the price of boulders at about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The association has undertaken too many work relief projects in recent years, and the relief funds have been exhausted, making it difficult to continue. Now that spring water is rising, dangerous projects are in danger, and the lives of dike residents are at stake, as are the interests of farmland. We hope that charitable people at home and abroad will help each other, save lives, and benefit farmland, which is related to the national economy and people's livelihood. With everyone's efforts, it is easy to lift, and with the accumulation of small things, it becomes a great achievement. Saving people is truly more meritorious than building a seven-level pagoda.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Grass and Wool Hat Industry Association stated that in recent years, foreign goods have been flooding the market, with falling prices and dumping, resulting in the gradual decline of the Chinese grass hat industry. Factories cannot support themselves and have closed down one after another. In order to provide relief, they have specially submitted requests to the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the Tax Department, and the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, requesting a thorough investigation of the value of foreign</p>
<p>imported wool hats, to tax them ad valorem, and to increase the import tax on grass and wool hats, so as to save the decline and maintain domestic goods. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e133">(Submission to the Ministry of Industry) <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Submission requesting an increase in the import tax on foreign wool hats. According to repeated statements from factory members, the Chinese wool hat industry has always been difficult to develop due to the flooding of foreign goods. Recently, foreign prices have plummeted, and foreign wool hats have been imported into our country, making competition even more fierce. As a result, the business of the Chinese wool hat industry is declining, making it impossible for each factory member to support itself. The association believes that the Chinese industry is still young. Most of the raw materials used for wool hats are supplied from foreign countries. When these raw materials are imported, import duties should be paid according to regulations. When the raw materials are made into wool hats and exported for sale, export duties must also be paid.</p>
<p>It is not like importing foreign goods, which only requires paying import duties, which is a lighter burden. A lighter burden makes it easier to promote sales, and a heavier burden makes competition difficult. Therefore, the ease of dumping foreign goods and the difficulty of developing domestic goods are closely related to the weight of taxation. The association is a Shanghai wool hat industry group and cannot sit idly by while the industry is collapsing. After careful discussion and repeated consideration by each factory member, we submit a document to the Ministry, requesting that the tax rate on foreign imported wool hats be increased, so that foreign wool hats will be difficult to compete with, and domestic wool hats will be able to promote sales. The people's livelihood and industry will be dependent on this. We are extremely urgent.</p>
<h3 id="e134">(Submission to the Tax Department) <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Submission requesting a thorough investigation of the value of foreign imported wool hats, to tax them ad valorem, in order to be fair. According to reports from factory members, the import of foreign wool hats is taxed at 40% according to the national tariff. However, the customs' tax assessment standard is often based on the bank remittance documents and invoices of the goods. There are many who report the actual value of the remittance price or the invoice sent, but there are also many who use cunning tricks, i.e. remit only half of the total value of the goods, with the other half being an account receivable, or report only half of the invoice value, thereby obscuring</p>
<p>the customs, so as to reduce their taxes. For example, when foreign wool hats are imported, each dozen is taxed based on an estimated customs value of only 3 to 5 yuan based on the remittance or invoice, while the market price is more than 10 to 20 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>This can be clearly proven. When competing with domestic wool hats in business, domestic goods will inevitably suffer greatly, and the customs' tax collection will also lose its fair principle. The association is a hat industry group and must state the facts to the Tax Department for the sake of the interests of the industry. We sincerely request that you investigate and verify the wholesale price of foreign imported wool hats on the market in the future, and use it to collect taxes, so as to be fair. If the customs cannot determine the value by itself, you may send a letter to the association, and we will investigate it on your behalf,</p>
<p>or purchase the same goods directly from the source for reference, so as not to lose fairness. We would be very grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e135">(Original Approval Orders) <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>(1) Approval order from the Ministry of Industry: The submission has been noted. We have consulted the Ministry of Finance and forwarded it to the National Tariff Commission for consideration when revising the tariff. Please be informed of this approval. (2) Approval order from the Tax Department: The submission has been noted. The fact that the factory has made this report shows that it is concerned about tax revenue, which is commendable. However, the points mentioned seem to be unclear about the facts. The customs assess the value of imported wool hats based on real-time market prices. According to the assessment files, the tax-paid price per dozen is mostly between 8 yuan and 30 yuan in customs gold units, and not 3 yuan to 5 yuan as stated in the submission. If the factory can truthfully report a certain shipment that was hastily valued by the customs, resulting in a low price, we would be happy to hear it. This approval. (3) Approval order from the Customs Superintendent: It concerns the investigation of market prices for import wool hats for taxation, which has been approved by the Tax Department.</p>

<h3 id="e137">News on the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Strike Yesterday; The Strike Committee Petitioned Yesterday; The Social Affairs Bureau Will Mediate Today <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory strike remains at a stalemate. The Strike Committee</p>
<p>petitioned the Party Department yesterday, and the Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene a mediation meeting today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Calling for Questioning: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, believing that the Anglo-American strike is a serious matter, reported to the Municipal Government for instructions on how to handle it and decided to convene a mediation committee this morning (29th) to conduct mediation. However, in order to solicit the opinions of the workers, the Bureau first summoned the labor union leaders Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, and others to the Bureau for questioning at 11:00 AM yesterday. Wang Gang, the director of the mediation section, met with them. After inquiring in detail about the strike situation, he ordered the workers' representatives to send official representatives to the Bureau tomorrow (today) to await mediation. However, he hoped that the dispute would not be expanded to avoid causing accidents.</p>
<p>Meeting of the Strike Committee: The Strike Committee convened its third meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Thirty-nine strike committee members attended. Chairman Chen Peide reported on Chairman Chiang's telegram to the municipal Party and government organs, setting a deadline for resumption of work. However, he hoped that the strike would not be expanded and that there would be an orderly struggle before the strike was resolved. Then, the following were discussed: (1) A proposal to appoint representatives to attend the mediation meeting convened by the Social Affairs Bureau tomorrow. Resolution: Chen Peide and Lou Jingguan were appointed as representatives, and other strike committee members attended as observers. (2) A proposal to invite all sectors in Pudong to provide assistance in the afternoon. Resolution: Passed. (3) A proposal to notify all workers to strictly observe order before the strike is resolved. Resolution: Transferred to the Maintenance Section. (4) A proposal to ask workers from the three factories to express the same opinion. Resolution: Omitted. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Expanding Propaganda: Workers at the factory convened a propaganda meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. It was decided to expand the organization of the propaganda meeting, with Fei Keguang appointed as director, Wang Ajin as commander, and Hong Maoquan, Zhang Zhenxuan, Tang Jintang, and Zhang Awu as squadron leaders. Each squadron was divided into three detachments, with twenty people in each detachment. All departed immediately to expand propaganda in various districts, requesting all sectors to stop buying and smoking various cigarettes produced by the company before the strike is resolved. In addition, the female workers' propaganda team also departs in batches every day to promote awareness, so as to attract social attention.</p>
<p>Declaration from the Industrial Sector: Pudong labor unions issued a joint declaration yesterday to support Anglo-American workers, stating that the Anglo-American Tobacco Company in Pudong suddenly and without reason closed its factory without the approval of our national Party and government organs, intending to dismiss a large number of workers who have worked the longest and have the highest wages, in order to evade the pensions of each worker, and falsely accusing the workers of not being obedient to command, leading to a collective strike and resistance, forcing them to extremes. The situation has been going on for many days, but the company has not yet woken up. If this continues, how can the workers' livelihoods be imagined? Moreover, we fear that once this bad example is set, other capitalists will follow suit, and the compatriots of other factories will become the Anglo-American workers of today. Thinking about the future, we cannot help but feel chilled. The labor unions deeply feel the pain and are duty-bound to go through fire and water. Therefore, from today onwards, we will notify all workers to uphold the determination not to buy, sell, or transport products of the Anglo-American Tobacco Company, so as to urge the company to wake up and restore the factory. That is when the labor unions withdraw their decision. We sincerely declare this, and we beg for the public's judgment.

After Li was released from prison, and Zhu was unable to do what he wanted, he tricked Li and his wife into going to Shanghai Yinghuali on Robert Road, and then took Li Wanshi as his own, and sold Li's eleven-year-old daughter for money. Li inevitably complained. Zhu then devised a plan to lure Li to Longhua, and in the evening, induced him to the station, taking the Shanghai-Hangzhou freight train back to Shanghai, and after passing the Longhua Jiangqiao, pushed Li into the river, intending to drown him, and went back pleased with himself. Zhu told Li's wife that Li had found work and would return the next day, and she happily went to sleep. However, Li was not destined to die and was rescued by the water patrol team, and explained the situation to them, who arrested Zhu Laoba and brought him to the local court, and charged him with attempted murder. Yesterday afternoon at 2 pm, Judge Shao Jiazhi opened the court and sentenced Zhu to twenty years of imprisonment as a warning because of his malicious intent.</p>

<p>Li, the stepmother of Shen Wenda, a staff member of the Shibao Newspaper, was sent to the Shangxian Hall Women and Children's Hospital for childbirth last month because she was in her full month of pregnancy.

When asked again, he suddenly fell to the ground again, losing consciousness. The police then took him to Renji Hospital, but the rescue was ineffective, and he died. The Lao Zha Police Station ordered detectives to investigate, and then took the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the First Special Court arrived at the office and determined that the man had died of illness. Since the family could not be found, the body was photographed and his family was awaited to come and identify it. The corpse will be put in a coffin by the relief hall.</p>

<p>The Penglai Market National Products Exhibition, sponsored by the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, began construction on the 20th of this month. Originally planned for 150 rooms, after the National Products Exhibitions in Nanjing and Hankou ended, manufacturers in this city closed their businesses and returned to the south, requesting to register with the association. Therefore, the original number was insufficient for distribution, and an expansion was undertaken, adding 50 rooms, for a total of 200 rooms, to meet the needs of the manufacturers. The representatives of the manufacturers decided at a general meeting that the opening would be held on the afternoon of June 1. The drawing of lots was held at 4 PM yesterday afternoon at the Penglai Market Association. Representatives from the Yabuer Electric Appliance Factory, the Home Industry Society, the Great China Rubber Factory, the Sanhe Weaving Factory, the Dalong Woolen Factory, and over 200 other manufacturers attended.

<h3 id="e160">Itinerant Magicians Have Many Tricks, Even Mud Bodhisattvas Can Speak, Six Gold Sovereigns and a Gold Box Lost, Clerk of a Cloth Store Tricked Repeatedly, Pitiful and Laughable <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Gu Dehua, a 34-year-old from Suzhou, has been working as a clerk at the Gongyi Foreign Cloth Store at 520 Tianjin Road. He has no past faults and is trusted by the manager. On the 7th of this month, Gu was visiting a friend at the Far Eastern Hotel on Xizang Road when he saw a sign hanging in front of room 214 of the hotel, which read "Huan You Ke" (Itinerant Official), a fortune teller. He could not help but be moved by curiosity, and immediately knocked on the door and entered, asking for his fortune to be told. At that time, a young man in the room saw Gu arrive, quickly stood up and offered him a seat. After a brief conversation, the young man claimed to be Zhao Zhewun, only 24 years old, originally from Nanjing, and a disciple of Huan You Ke. He said that his master was away on business, and boasted that he had obtained his master's secrets and could inherit his mantle. Gu was thus</p>
<h3 id="e161">swayed by sweet words <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>and asked him to tell his fortune. Zhao touched Gu's facial features and both hands, and then spoke nonsense, saying that Gu's fate was extremely bad. If he wanted to avoid misfortune and seek good fortune, he would have to resolve the stars, otherwise disasters would frequently occur, and he would inevitably face great calamities, etc. Gu asked how much it would cost. Zhao asked for a fortune-telling fee of four yuan and eight dimes, but if he wanted to resolve the stars, he would have to prepare six gold sovereigns. This matter was important, and his master should perform the ritual himself. He then arranged for Gu to meet with his master on the 9th to discuss the matter. Gu paid the fortune-telling fee and left. On the 9th, he went as agreed. In addition to Zhao, there was another person sitting in the room. Gu thought that this person might be Huan You Ke, but after they exchanged names, he knew that it was not him.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Also a Fortune Teller <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>His real name was Ding Hongyuan, and his signboard name was Dongfang Bo. His residence was at No. 62, Lane 58, Minti Niyin Road in the French Concession. Dongfang Bo's itinerant magic was more skilled than Zhao's. Before he could finish a few words, Gu obeyed him. He immediately did as he was instructed, going outside to buy a mud sculpture of a small Bodhisattva, placing it in an empty cigarette can, lining the can with yellow cloth, and wrapping it in red silk. After Gu had wrapped the can, Dongfang Bo told him to hold the can to his ear and ask a question, and the can would definitely answer. Gu first asked his name and age, and indeed he vaguely heard an answer, and the answer was correct. Gu could not help but</p>
<h3 id="e163">was overjoyed <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Then he asked if he could get rich. Unexpectedly, the answer was that he would be able to make 300,000 in wealth in the future. Gu was even more ecstatic. In fact, at this time, Gu's psychological state had changed greatly due to Dongfang Bo's words. The so-called answer from the can was purely from Dongfang Bo, who was standing next to Gu, taking advantage of the gap when Gu's mind was not distracted. Gu was bewitched by the sweet words, and those involved in the matter were blinded, and he deeply believed in the supernatural. Dongfang Bo saw that Gu had taken the bait, and continued to advise Gu to resolve the stars and quickly prepare the gold sovereigns as needed. By the 11th, Gu spent 127 yuan and four dimes to get</p>
<h3 id="e164">five gold sovereigns <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Holding them, he went to the Far East. The magicians also ordered him to place the gold sovereigns in an empty cigarette can and accompany them to the Suzhou Creek, where they threw the can into the river, saying that this was the method of resolving the stars. In fact, the gold sovereigns in the can had already been stolen in secret. However, the magicians had originally asked for six gold sovereigns, but Gu had only given them five, so they ordered him to prepare the remaining one by the 15th to avoid losing all his previous efforts. On the due date, Gu brought the gold sovereign, but the magicians had already left the Far East and set up a secret room at the Great China Hotel, Room 425. When Gu arrived, the magicians still ordered him to do as before, going to the Bund of Edward Road by the river, and again</p>
<p>They made him toss the can</p>
<h3 id="e165">into the Huangpu <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, he was deceived twice, but he was still not aware of it. Dongfang Bo and others continued to deceive him, saying that he still needed a gold box in the shape of a matchbox, containing 85 yuan in banknotes, for application. Gu did not dare to disobey, and prepared it on the 21st. At this time, the magicians had changed the room to Room 445. After they met, they still went to the Huangpu River, and Dongfang Bo threw the box remotely. In a flash, the real thing was in his pocket, and they went back to their residence. In the period from May 7 to the 21st, Gu lost a total of 534 yuan. The funds were</p>
<h3 id="e166">secretly taken from the business <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>and his colleagues told the manager, and he questioned Gu and told him why he was deceived. Gu didn't believe it at first, but then he suspected, so he went to the Far East Hotel on the 26th to negotiate with the magicians and ask for the money back. Unexpectedly, Dongfang Bo and others relied on their strength and numbers at that time, and not only did they not return the money, but they forced Gu to agree that the money was given voluntarily. Gu did not dare to resist at that time. Later, he reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, and Detective Shen Jinwen arrested Dongfang Bo and Zhao Zhewun and brought them to the Local Court of the First Special District yesterday morning. Judge Huang interrogated them. First, Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated the case, and then questioned the two defendants, who shirked responsibility to each other. The court ordered them to be detained and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Jha Bei Rui Kang Li Cracks Down on Flower Gambling Den; Zhang A'liu Has Been Arrested Over a Dozen Times, Still Unrepentant, Will Face Severe Punishment <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>In recent months, in the Zhabei area, gambling dens, flower gambling dens, and opium dens have been cracked down on repeatedly, amounting to dozens of cases. Among them, the large flower gambling houses are the worst, even sending out henchmen to entice gamblers, opening three sessions a day to profit from it, with daily income reaching alarming amounts. The harm to society could not be greater. Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has issued a general order to all jurisdictions to pursue the main culprits, Wang Xiaogaozi and Yang Dasi, for severe punishment. Unexpectedly, they learned of this in advance and fled without a trace. At the same time, the large flower gambling houses were also moved to other places, so they were not caught. However, they soon relapsed into their old ways and set up flower gambling dens in the four villages of Zhabei, hiring many gangsters to attract gamblers from various places. However, the police detectives exerted all their efforts, so they were soon cracked down on. They then began to restrain themselves slightly. Unexpectedly, at around 7 PM the night before last, Luo, the chief of the Third Division of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, suddenly received a secret report stating that a flower gambling den was set up in house number 53, Duankang Lane, within his jurisdiction, collecting three sessions a day, with huge wins and losses. They had printed leaflets for the Heji Zhongxing Formal Old Den, distributing them everywhere to entice gamblers. Upon receiving the information, the chief immediately led the police officers to rush to search and arrest them, catching Zhang A'liu, the gambling den owner, and Wu Da, a partner, on the spot. Dozens of leaflets printed on red and green paper, as well as flower gambling charts, gambling funds, and other evidence, were seized and escorted to the station. Under interrogation, it was revealed that Zhang A'liu, also known as Zhang Afu, was a key figure in the flower gambling dens in the Jiaxing Road area, having been arrested by the police for flower gambling crimes more than a dozen times. Unexpectedly, after being released from prison, he remained unrepentant, which was truly abhorrent. He was ordered to be detained temporarily, pending the arrest of his accomplices,</p>
<p>to be dealt with severely in the same case. The evidence will be filed.</p>

<p>Ye Xiaoying, a young girl from Shaoxing, 29 years old and graceful, met Zhang Zhonghe, a local youth (currently 21 years old and employed at the Jianghai Customs) last year, and immediately fell in love at first sight. They progressed from friendship to physical intimacy, and the two were full of regret for meeting so late. They then rented a house together in the Simali No. 2 building on Fangbanqiao. Zhang would often visit Ye for secret meetings during his days off from work. Sometimes they would hold hands and go out to various cinemas and amusement parks, whispering sweet words, looking like a young couple. However, time flies easily, and more than a year has passed, yet they have not held a wedding ceremony. Xiaoying often lamented this, repeatedly expressing it to Zhang, but it never came to fruition. A few days ago, with Zhang's consent, they both reported to their families, hoping for a happy marriage to be completed soon. Unexpectedly, good things often have setbacks, and beautiful scenery does not last long. Zhang's mother firmly opposed it. The two had no solution. The afternoon before yesterday, they went to the Shanghai Hotel on Xiangfen Lane and booked room 523 to discuss it, but there was still no concrete solution. When yesterday evening came, Zhang made an excuse to go out and did not return for a long time. Xiaoying, deeply infatuated, thought that Zhang Zhonghe was an ungrateful person. She immediately summoned the tea room attendant, gave them one silver dollar, and bought opium to swallow. After 8 PM, she went to room 540 on the same floor, where her close friend had opened a room, and inquired about Zhang's whereabouts. Suddenly, her complexion changed drastically, and her tone became abnormal. Her girlfriend's husband, Mr. Huang, noticed this, interrogated her severely, and she finally revealed the truth. She was rushed to the Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The Hengji steamship of the China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau on North Suzhou Road in this city was robbed by bandits at Zhangjiakou, where Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces meet, at the end of last month, suffering heavy losses. They had reported it to the local authorities, requesting investigation and arrest to ensure the safety of travelers, but it has not yet been apprehended. On the 25th of this month, the Lisun steamship of the Lixing Steamship Bureau, running the Shanghai-Lake route, was robbed by more than ten bandits speaking a local accent and carrying weapons at the same location while returning from the lake to Shanghai. More than ten pieces of passenger cargo were lost, the account money in the accounting room and passengers' clothes were swept away. After an hour, they whooped and boarded a prepared small boat and left. Not long after, the Liji steamship of the China Merchants Bureau, also returning from the lake to Shanghai, was also robbed by bandits. After checking the losses, it amounted to about three or four thousand yuan. After the two bureaus had the incident, they immediately prepared documents to petition the local authorities for strict arrest, and also requested the Inland River Steamship Industry Association to present separate petitions to Chen, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Lu, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Liu, the captain of the Zhejiang Water Police Security Team, requesting them to promptly dispatch officers to investigate and arrest, to ensure the safety of travelers, and attached a list of losses. The above petitions were sent by telegraph yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e170">April's Foreign Trade Deficit Exceeds 59 Million Yuan; Surplus of Raw Gold and Silver is Also Very Large <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau announced yesterday the general situation of international trade in April, saying that the foreign trade situation in April this year was prosperous in sales and transfers, but still felt weakened compared to the same period last year. The total import volume in April was 100,960,369 yuan, and the total export volume was 41,123,563 yuan, resulting in a deficit of 59,836,806 yuan. Imports increased by 1,532,354 yuan compared to the previous month, and exports also increased by 1,008,142 yuan. The cumulative deficit for the four months of this year has reached 218,555,681 yuan, a decrease of 30.51% compared to the same period last year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Imports and Exports by Country: In terms of imports and exports by country, there have been no major changes compared to the past. The United States still maintains the top spot for imports, followed by Japan, and then England and Germany. In terms of exports, the United States also ranks first, followed by Hong Kong, then Japan and England. Exports to Russia this month also reached 1,623,755 yuan, an increase of 1,541,712 yuan in exports compared to the previous month, which is gratifying for the people of the country. Although exports to Japan this month have increased slightly, the number is extremely small. However, Japan's imports to us have increased by 3.9% compared to the previous month, and its trend of progress is indeed worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Imports and Exports by Port: In terms of imports and exports by port this month, Shanghai alone reached more than 59 million yuan in imports, a decrease of more than 6 million yuan compared to the previous month, while exports increased by nearly 2 million yuan. In other places such as Tianjin, exports decreased while imports increased, which is the result of Japanese goods dumping. The general situation in Guangzhou, Jiaozhou, and other places is stable, but the exports of Hankou Port are still extremely sluggish, while imports have increased, which is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Major Imports: In terms of major imported goods this month, cotton accounted for 6,007,815 gold units, hardware accounted for 5,383,368 gold units, rice accounted for 4,655,846 gold units, wheat accounted for 1,977,732 gold units, cotton cloth accounted for 1,703,315 gold units, sugar accounted for 1,139,588 gold units, and kerosene accounted for 1,006,430 gold units. The import volume of various commodities has declined compared to the previous month. Compared with the same period last year, except for an increase of more than one million gold units in hardware imports and a slight increase of 600,000 gold units in cotton, the other commodities have mostly decreased, especially wheat, kerosene, and rice, which is indeed a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>Major Exports: In terms of major export commodities, fur accounted for 4,529,150 yuan, tea accounted for 1,506,003 yuan, egg products accounted for 2,455,144 yuan, cotton yarn accounted for 1,756,572 yuan, raw silk accounted for 1,740,723 yuan, and tung oil accounted for 1,718,591 yuan. Compared with the previous month, the export value of various commodities has mostly increased, except for a slight decrease in fur and cotton yarn. Compared with the same period last year, tea, fur, and egg products have increased, while raw silk, cotton yarn, and tung oil have decreased.</p>
<p>Surplus of Raw Gold and Silver: As for the export of gold and silver, the import of silver coins and raw silver this month totaled 388,945 yuan, while the export was 15,152,635 yuan. There were no imports of gold coins and raw gold, while exports reached 2,798,139 gold units. In total, the surplus of raw silver and silver coins was 15,541,580 yuan, and the surplus of raw gold and gold coins was 2,798,139 gold units.</p>

<p>Increase Rate Varies for Each Brand; Further Price Increases Are Planned Successively</p>
<p>China's match industry has been greatly affected by the dumping of foreign matches, and its business has been extremely depressed. More than 20 manufacturers in Hebei and Shandong provinces have gone bankrupt as a result. The National Match Industry Federation, in view of this, organized a Match Price Maintenance Association in order to maintain business. In addition to holding a meeting last month to discuss organizational methods, it reconvened member manufacturers the day before yesterday (the 25th) to discuss ways to increase prices. According to Mr. Dong Shaolin, the secretary-general of the association, who spoke to a Dagongshe reporter yesterday, the Match Price Maintenance Committee is organized by match manufacturers in the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi and Hunan, and has decided to implement the increase in match prices in the above six provinces starting from the 25th of this month. The increase rate varies for each brand of match, approximately ranging from one-tenth to five-tenths of the original price. Further price increases are planned successively within the possible range.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Bonds to be Issued on Schedule; Explanation by the Head of the Finance Department <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has now decided to issue public bonds for 7 million yuan, which is part of the 15.5 million yuan in bonds authorized by this year's taxpayers' annual meeting. According to the Head of the Finance Department's explanation to the Finance Committee, he has carefully considered the interest rate for this new public bond. If the general economic situation improves, it will definitely affect the current low interest rates. Therefore, he suggests that for the long term, this bond should be fixed for 10 to 30 years, with an annual interest rate of 5%, and the funds received at the time of issuance will exceed the face value by 2.5%. According to this calculation, the annual interest rate for investors, calculated for 30 years, is approximately 4.84%. As for the repayment of principal, it will be done according to the use of the fund. However, the bonds from 1924, 1925, 1926, and 1927 should be repaid first. The 1924 public bond has been scheduled to be repaid on December 31st of this year. It seems that an opportunity can be given to the registered ticket holders to convert the bond into a new public bond. The terms of conversion will be formulated later. The new public bonds will be issued in the Chinese standard silver coins commonly used in this city. Regarding the weight and fineness of the silver coins, he believes that there is no need to explain further, because if regulations are added, taxpayers will inevitably have to prepare another fund to guarantee the fineness of the silver coins. Moreover, the credit of the Municipal Council is better today than ever before, and there is no need to adopt this dangerous principle. The opening of the new public bonds is scheduled to take place on May 31st. The Head of the Finance Department also stated that the registration and transfer of the Municipal Council's public bonds has always been free of charge. However, in view of the complexity of the transfer procedures, the expenditure on office expenses cannot but be increased. He believes that in the future, the general practice can be followed and a handling fee can be charged. He suggests that starting from this year's new public bonds, a fee of one yuan per bond will be charged for the transfer of bonds. All of the above suggestions have been adopted by the Finance Committee and approved by the Board of Directors for implementation.</p>

<p>Establishing the Shanghai United Regatta Preparatory Committee: The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo-Qiantang Railway Bureaus hosted leaders of universities and sports organizations in Shanghai at the Qingyang Port Railway Garden Hotel on May 27th. Those in attendance included Pan Tinggan and Chen Yuehe from Jiaotong University, Weng Zhilong and Yang Bosong from Tongji University, Yu Jie from Jinan University, Chen Xueru and Zhu Shijun from Guanghua University, Wu Shijie from Fudan University, He Shitao and Lao Jianshao from Zhizhi University, Ou Kuian and Wu Haoran from Daxia University, Wang Fudan from Jiangnan University, Ni Yuanqing and Deailv from St. John's University, Hu Wenyao and _Xianfa from _Dan University, Lu Lihua, Hu Zhengqu, and Chen Jucai from the Liangjiang Sports Normal School, Chen Shouze from the Shanghai Municipal Sports Ground, Li Qiulin from the Chinese Sports Association, Lu Zhiming from the Youyou Sports Association, and Lao Jieming from the Jingwu Sports Association. At 9:00 AM, Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng of the Railway Bureau and senior officials of the bureau, along with representatives from the two railway sports associations, accompanied them by car from the North Station. After arriving at Qingyang Port, a tea party was held in the Garden Hotel. Deputy Director Wu stood up to give a speech, saying that it was an honor to have the representatives present. Director Huang of their bureau had originally planned to come to host them, but he was not feeling well this morning and could not attend. He asked Shaozeng to apologize on his behalf and welcomed everyone with the utmost respect. He said that there were two meanings to inviting everyone today: (1) Today is the second day of the regatta held by foreigners at Qingyang Port, and it happens to be the fifth day of the opening of the Qingyang Port Garden Hotel of their railway. He invited everyone to come here for sightseeing, provide guidance, and take the opportunity to visit the grand regatta. (2) Their bureau believes that the railway's most important task is of course the issue of travel for the general public. At the same time, it also has a considerable mission in promoting education and various social issues, especially in promoting outdoor sports. Today, he wants to discuss it with everyone. Rowing competitions are a full-body exercise and can demonstrate the spirit of cooperation, which is very beneficial. Qingyang Port is an excellent location for regattas. Foreigners hold regattas here every year, but Chinese people do not have this sport. Their bureau believes that the biggest problem with today's Chinese youth is their physical weakness. The way to remedy this is to promote equal emphasis on physical training and academic research, and to replace improper entertainment with entertainment that benefits the body. Also, because Chinese people's habits are more inclined towards stillness than activity, outdoor and active entertainment should be promoted. Therefore, he especially invited everyone to exchange opinions. It seems that rowing competitions can be promoted. If you agree, please promote it together. Their bureau will do its best to assist within the possible range. For example, all arrangements and equipment can be handled by their bureau. Each time you travel by train, their bureau can provide considerable preferential treatment. However, the only hope they have is to enable young people to use their holidays to engage in sports here and spend some time outdoors, so that diligent students do not confine themselves to small rooms all day long, and dissolute people do not only go to dance halls and theaters, in order to benefit their bodies and minds. However, they do not want to tempt young people with the beautiful facilities and comfortable services of the Garden Hotel and increase their consumption. This point should be solemnly stated in advance. On the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar, there is the Dragon Boat Festival. Now, the fifth day of the fifth month of the Gregorian calendar is the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary government. It is also possible to designate this day as the day for rowing competitions, adopting the legacy of the Dragon Boat Festival and promoting the spirit of sports and cooperation among Chinese people, which seems to be very interesting and valuable. Subsequently, Mr. Weng Zhilong, Mr. Hu Wenyao, Mr. Ou Kuian, and Mr. Lao Jianshao successively expressed their opinions. It was decided to establish the Shanghai United Regatta Preparatory Committee on the spot, and Weng Zhilong (Tongji), Wang Fudan (Jiangnan), Pan Tinggan (Jiaotong), Yu Jie (Jinan), Wu Shijie (Fudan), Ou Kuian (Daxia), Zhu Shijun (Guanghua), and others were elected as preparatory committee members, with Weng Zhilong as the chief committee member. Then, the organizational and funding issues were discussed. It was decided that regarding the organizational issue, the articles of association should be drafted first, and Wang Fudan, Shen Guoquan, Yu Jie, Wu Shijie, and He Chunhui were appointed as committee members, with Wang Fudan as the chief committee member. Regarding the funding issue, a concrete plan should be drafted first, and Ou Kuian, Wang Fudan, Lao Jieming, Li Qiulin, Hu Wenyao, Lu Zhiming, and Cao Shengsan were appointed as committee members, with Wang Fudan as the chief committee member. It was also decided that a general meeting of representatives of universities and sports organizations would be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 9:00 AM on June 10th (Sunday) to determine organizational and economic issues and to carry out preparatory matters. The Railway Bureau will be responsible for preparing and sending out invitations for the dinner party. The tea party ended at 11:30 AM. The representatives toured the various parts of the hotel for a week. At noon, they had lunch under the hotel's veranda. After lunch, they took a steamboat to watch the foreign regatta and traveled downstream to the suburbs of Kunshan to enjoy the scenery on the water. At around 4:00 PM, they returned to the hotel by boat. On this day, the weather was clear and sunny, the flowers and trees in the garden were competing in beauty, the springs and rocks were displaying their charm, the clear waves on the harbor were sparkling with green, and the trees were flowing with splendor. In addition, the visitors attending the regatta were endless, and the tourists in the Garden Hotel were as knowledgeable as those in the countryside, which was truly an unprecedented spectacle.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Establishment of the Fuyin School Board of Directors <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Fuyin School for the Deaf and Mute at Kangjia Bridge on Xijesifei Road in this city was founded by Mr. Fu Bulan, the principal of the Hongqiao Road School for the Blind, according to the will of his father, Dr. Fu Lanya. Since its establishment eight years ago, it has achieved remarkable results. Its curriculum, equipment, specialized teachers, and novel teaching methods have long been praised by public opinion, which is unnecessary for us to elaborate on. It is now known that the school, in order to strive for perfection, rescue the disabled, and seek the development of this special education, has repeatedly invited charitable figures from all walks of life to serve as school directors to support it. Many major charities have also been able to enthusiastically support it and agree to serve as school directors. Therefore, a founding meeting was held in the school auditorium at 5:00 PM yesterday, and student achievements and speech performances were displayed to entertain the new directors. Those who attended included Zhu Shaoping, Wang Yiting, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Heqin, Zhang Ji, Mrs. Wu Tiecheng (represented by Ms. Yang Yixi), Zhang Jiongbo (represented by Ms. Zhang Hanpingqing), and more than a dozen others. Zhu Peide, Huang Shaoxiong, Wang Zhengting, and others were unable to attend due to other matters. Principal Fu presided over the meeting. First, the chairman reported the school's history, current situation, and future hopes as follows: In the autumn of the 15th year of the Republic of China, the Hangzhou School for the Deaf and Mute, due to lack of funds, asked the School for the Blind in Shanghai for help. In that year, a civil house in Kangjia Bridge on Xijesifei Road was rented as the school building, and the current Fuyin School for the Deaf and Mute was established. At that time, there were only a dozen students. It has been painstakingly managed to this day. Currently, there are a total of 63 male and female students. The school's operating expenses rely entirely on students paying tuition. However, the annual tuition of less than 7,000 yuan is far from covering the 9,000 yuan in expenses. There are eleven faculty and staff members, some of whom are graduates of specialized departments, some are graduates of art schools, some have studied at universities, and some are graduates of the school's normal school. Graduates of the normal school have served as teachers in schools for the deaf and mute in Harbin and Wuchang, two in each. One person is employed at this school (there is currently one normal school student). Many graduates of the school for the deaf and mute are working in the Commercial Press and the World Book Company, some are working as painters, some are working as pharmacists, some are teaching, and some are specializing in art. The rest are largely unknown. The hope for the future is to obtain a larger and better school building so that the disabled can be fully accommodated, and it is urgently necessary to establish a school foundation to seek the progress of the cause, which depends on the enthusiastic donations of the directors. After the chairman's report, Wang Yiting, Pan Gongzhan, Zhu Shaoping, Zhang Ji, Chen Heqin, and others successively gave speeches, mostly praising the school's achievements, admiring Mr. Fu's spirit of engaging in charitable education, and wishing him continued progress and success. After the speeches, Zhu Shaoping temporarily proposed to elect the chairman of the board of directors, and Mrs. Wu Tiecheng was immediately elected as chairman. The first meeting of the board of directors was held at the same time, and four resolutions were passed: (1) Everyone should donate money to help a certain number of students who cannot afford to pay tuition as a standard. (2) A letter should be sent to the municipal government requesting a donation of a piece of public land for the construction of a school building. (3) Director Pan should come forward and request a subsidy from the Municipal Bureau of Education. (4) Everyone should donate a certain amount of money on the spot. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Another Accomplice Apprehended in the Siberia Jewelry Company Robbery Case <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Siberia Jewelry Company at No. 82 Nanjing Road was robbed between July 1st and 3rd of last year. The thieves broke through the wall from an empty house next door and stole diamonds and other items worth approximately 125,000 yuan. Subsequently, the patrolmen apprehended the main culprit in the case, Luo Guoqing, and several other accomplices, and they were sent to the First Special Court for sentencing. However, Luo and others had testified at the time that a Romanian named Frederick Bogutov had rented the empty house next to Siberia, and received 50 yuan of silver after the incident. Because Frederick was at large, the First Special Court issued a warrant for his arrest. It was not until 8:45 PM the day before yesterday that the detectives of the French Concession Police Department learned that Frederick was hiding at No. 302 Huanlong Road, so they went to arrest him. Because the crime scene was in the Public Concession, he was immediately transferred to the Laozha Patrol Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case and said that Frederick had confessed to the police and there was a confession record, but it had not yet been translated into Chinese. The police are currently investigating the evidence, so he requested a postponement. Judge Qian Hongye immediately questioned the defendant as to whether the confession record was in his own handwriting. Frederick replied that it was. Judge Qian then ordered the defendant to be returned to detention and postponed the hearing.</p>

<p>Wuhua Bank's Five-Year Savings Plan</p>
<p>Since Wang Jian'e took office as the manager of the Baxianqiao branch of the Wuhua Bank, he has been actively preparing for its opening soon. It is also learned that Mr. Wang has recently launched a five-year savings plan. Regular bank savings accounts typically have a 15-year term, and depositing and withdrawing money can be difficult. The bank has shortened the term to five years. The calculation method uses a progressive or compound interest system. Withdrawals often have odd small amounts, so extra interest is added to calculate as a whole number. For example, depositing five yuan per month will result in 400 yuan in five years, and depositing 125 yuan per month will result in 10,000 yuan. This is divided into ten different amounts. Savings plans at other banks require depositing over 130 yuan per month to obtain 10,000 yuan after five years. Compared to others, this plan has four or five hundred yuan of surplus, truly starting a new era in savings.</p>

<p>Director of Fushì Hospital, Dr. Hasupó, Offers Free Clinic</p>
<p>The Fulü Hospital attached to the Jinjiaqi Pole Occupational Association provides free consultations all year round and provides free medicine to inpatients, benefiting fellow professionals and the public for years. With the increasing number of patients seeking treatment in the summer, the association recognizes that the general public often lacks the financial means to seek treatment when they are sick. Ordinary illnesses can be delayed, but emergency treatments for seasonal epidemics cannot be delayed without leading to death. This pain is felt by many people in these times of bankruptcy in all industries. To provide assistance for public illness and avoid using the name of providing free medicine, the association has consulted Dr. Hasupó, Director of Fulü Hospital to additionally set up a public clinic at Dr. Ha's clinic, No. 653, Zhao Jia Road in Ximen Nei, offering free public clinic hours every day from 8 am to 10 am, only collecting the registration fee, and also giving out half price medicine vouchers to the poor. We hope those who are sick but lack the financial means will take note.</p>
<p>Jishenghui's Good Medicine Benefits the World</p>
<p>The Chinese Jishenghui in this city distributes various epidemic prevention medicines every spring and summer. A medicine called Shishasan can treat seasonal illnesses and is extremely effective. Dip a lamp wick in the medicine and apply it to the corners of both eyes. Apply it to all four corners in severe cases. Do not be afraid of the pain when applying it. Apply it two or three more times until the illness improves and it is no longer painful. If it is not a seasonal illness, the medicine will not hurt when it enters the eye, and you must seek medical treatment elsewhere. Tearing and pain indicate that the medicine is reaching the dantian. Numbness and coldness in the limbs indicate that the illness is improving. Remember that this medicine must not be ingested, as it can harm your health. We are making this clear in case women and children do not know and use it by mistake. Please note that one bottle of this medicine can treat three or four people. The treatment is effective when the patient's limbs are no longer numb and cold and the body feels comfortable. The medicine packet contains wicks. Wet it with warm water before applying. If a child has infantile convulsion or is severely hot without tears, applying this medicine to the corners of the eyes can open the sensory orifices. If an adult collapses from a stroke, applying the medicine in this way can also help open the orifices and provide emergency relief. All children and adults with the above symptoms can be treated according to this method.</p>

<p>To the esteemed chief editor of Shenbao Newspaper,</p>
<p>I am writing to you in response to the article published in your newspaper on May 26 regarding the Li Ruisheng fraud case, which stated that "the suspect confessed in the Sixth District Public Security Bureau that the British-owned Xīn Jì Yángháng at the intersection of Five Malu and Jiangxi Road was rebranding inferior playing cards to deceive Chinese people," causing great consternation. After investigating, we found that the Sān'ài and other playing cards managed by our company are all produced by the Bǎilìkè Playing Card Factory, and both customs and banks can prove this. The suspect fabricated the facts in an attempt to evade responsibility because his fraud was unsuccessful, which is worthy of abhorrence. In addition to requesting the court to severely punish him, we hereby request that you quickly correct this information in your newspaper. Sincerely, Card Department, Xīn Jì Yángháng, May 28th</p>

<p>Table of Contents (1) To the Participants of the Reading Club (2) What We Hope Readers Will Pay Attention To</p>
<h3 id="e193">To the Participants of the Reading Club <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The reading club that everyone has been eagerly awaiting has not yet been formally established. This not only causes everyone anxiety, but it also makes us feel ashamed. The slow and difficult birth of the reading club also has its reasons. We always feel that when starting a new endeavor, we must not be negligent and should have detailed plans and adequate preparations. Now, everything is basically ready, and we are just waiting for the Youth Association to determine the date of the general meeting so that we can start. Regarding our preparations and the preparations that readers should make before participating, we should make the following report to readers.</p>
<h3 id="e194">(Preparation Process) <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the reading club in the fifth issue of Reading News, we have been preparing for it every day. The details have also been announced successively, so there is no need to repeat them here. However, it is necessary to tell everyone about our cooperation with the Youth Association. After we decided to hold the reading club, we contacted the Youth Association to borrow a venue. It turned out that the Youth Association was also planning to hold a reading club and wanted to invite us to jointly host it. We felt that since everyone's goals were the same, joining forces would be better to concentrate talent and resources. So, after discussing, everyone decided to join forces as one. After the decision was made, we held several meetings to discuss specific measures. As a result, everyone drafted a</p>
<h3 id="e195">(Draft Plan) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Originally, we wanted to only be responsible for convening and intended to have the organizational method generated by the first general meeting. Later, we felt that everyone would not be prepared for the first discussion, and the organizational plan would probably be difficult to concretely determine. Moreover, recently many applicants have sent in proposals and opinions. Therefore, we believe that it would be better to combine these valuable opinions from readers and draft a plan to submit to the general meeting for discussion. This draft plan is divided into eight items. Now, let's summarize the main points as follows:</p>
<p>There are four main objectives of the reading club: (1) To freely discuss academics with an objective attitude; (2) To assist the masses with lower cultural standards; (3) To study theories without forgetting practice; (4) To have extremely free discussions but not to engage in any social activities. As for the discussion methods, they are divided into elementary classes and advanced classes. In the elementary classes, readers with the same level, with everyone's consent, read a certain type of book and form a reading group. The advanced class takes the combination of theory and practice as the principle, and the content of the assigned readings is extended to the study of practical problems. We hope that everyone will soon</p>
<h3 id="e196">Prepare Yourself <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>According to your own interests, plan to participate in which class of research and send us a list of the subjects you want to research and the "certain type of book" you want to read as soon as possible, so that we can compile and classify them in advance. If you have great expectations for the reading club, then you must prepare yourself in advance before the meeting so that our reading club can be actively established. Only in this way will it continue to thrive and be full of vitality in the future. Therefore, in addition to the above minimum preparations, we also hope that you will consider more about (1) what methods should be adopted in the reading club to achieve our reading goals; (2) how to make group exploration better than individual research. Recently,</p>

<p>Who have written to request participation. This is a de facto limitation, and we cannot invite them to Shanghai. In the future, in addition to broadcasting our research reports in Reading News to repay these enthusiastic friends, we can only express our sympathy and regret.</p>
<h3 id="e199">(What We Hope Readers Will Pay Attention To) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Some things that we hope readers will pay attention to have been said repeatedly, but sometimes you still don't pay attention. Let's say it again here!</p>
<h3 id="e200">(Do Not Slack) <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Previously, we stated that anyone who wished to participate in our research department, if they did not communicate with us for two months and did not submit a reading report, we would cancel their registration. However, some readers still make this mistake after joining. This phenomenon of slackness continues, which greatly hinders our work. Therefore, we are implementing our previous decision and canceling the registration of readers who are lukewarm in their interest. We welcome new friends to fill the vacancies. Here are eleven friends, Wu Fanzhou, Li Bing, Dong Ji, Wen Zhuangzhong, Chen Jing, Xiao Jiazheng, Zhu Jiming, Fan Fang, Shao Jiren, Pan Ruhai, Zhu Boyan, who have not come to the office to collect their registration certificates for a long time, and their registration is canceled. In addition, we hope that other registered members will pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e201">(Reading Reports) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Readers asked us to introduce books and question us, but after doing so once, some readers stopped writing. This is what disappoints us the most. Because we don't know if they are satisfied with our reply; whether they have read the books we introduced them to, and whether they understand them. These are things we must know.</p>
<h3 id="e202">(Introduction and Criticism) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Although we spend all day finding good books for you to read, our knowledge is ultimately limited. If you have any books worth recommending, please send them to us, and it would be best to briefly point out the advantages of the book. Similarly, if you can point out the disadvantages of a book as much as possible, it would also be a meritorious deed, so please report it to us for our reference and to remedy our oversight. Recently, Mr. Zhu Xiafeng sent us a letter pointing out the errors in our "Reading Questions and Answers Collection" and the points he doubted, one by one. On the one hand, we thank him for his sincerity in caring for us, and we admire his reading spirit and attitude of seeking truth. We hope that readers can make extremely strict criticisms of our publications.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Royal Incense Floating Record <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In the middle, there are two horizontal wooden supports, one in front and one in the back. Their position: exactly between the palanquin itself and the two horizontal beams at the head and tail, but slightly longer by one or two feet; each of the four corners also has two porters carrying it. So, when combined, there are sixteen porters in total.</p>
<p>The exterior of the imperial palanquin is even more brilliant! The front, back, left, and right are all made of thin silk bordered with gold thread, lined with yellow satin inside, making it exceptionally luxurious and magnificent, beyond description. Moreover, there are four blue flying dragons painted on all sides, making the atmosphere even more majestic and splendid! The style of the palanquin roof is completely made according to the style of a palace, with upturned eaves, painted with gold and green, glittering and shining. In the very center of the top, there is also a yellow sphere, about the size of a bunch of grapes; although this sphere is hollow, it is entirely made of pure gold.</p>
<p>There is one more thing we must recognize, although the style of this imperial palanquin is inevitably a bit ancient, its exterior, interior, upper part, and lower part are all very beautiful; it must also be very comfortable for people to sit inside! However, when it comes to sitting, I have never tried it. As far as I know, apart from the Empress Dowager herself, only Li Lianying, because he was responsible for cleaning and tidying up this imperial palanquin, could go inside to clean up when the Empress Dowager was not in the palanquin; no one else dared to stretch their legs and step inside, let alone ride in it! Even the "Eight Treasures" pattern embroidered on the yellow satin inside could only be used on things used by the Empress Dowager. From my long speech, it is not surprising that this imperial palanquin occupies a carriage alone on our imperial train, and it can also be said to be "as it should be"! (45)</p>
<h3 id="e206">Beggars of Shanghai <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Being too poor to eat and becoming a beggar is a matter of course in life. But in Shanghai, being a beggar is not easy either. The beggars of Shanghai are divided into categories, each with its own style, guarding its own territory, and not encroaching on each other. And within the same category of beggars, they each have their own territory, which is not allowed to be invaded.</p>
<p>Beggars on busy roads, in addition to begging from pedestrians, are not allowed to engage in any other means of asking for money. Moreover, the area allowed is only a certain sidewalk section from Road A to Road B and is not allowed to exceed the range. The same is true for rickshaw puller beggars on the bridges of Suzhou Creek. They are only allowed to operate on one side of a certain bridge. If they exceed the range, they are not allowed to fight back even if they are beaten. As for those beggars who collect leftover rice from restaurants and delivery men at the entrances of various lanes, the rules are even stricter. Not only are there territories, but each beggar has fixed households.</p>
<p>Red and white invitations also have territories and do not encroach on each other. Those who use naked children lying on the ground to beg for money from pedestrians also have designated areas, and they cannot walk around in the north and south markets. Only those who wear long gowns, hold bamboo tubes, and sing Taoist ditties are not restricted by territory.</p>
<p>Each of the above categories of beggars has its own leader. Each</p>
<p>leader has absolute authority and the ability to control every "small role." The lives of the leaders are very comfortable, and some even have wives and concubines like the people of Qi. The source of this lifestyle, needless to say, is the extraction of the surplus profits of every beggar. And the beggars are willing to be exploited by the leaders because, it is said, they cannot get "work" otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Passing the Butcher Shop at Night <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>There are no bright streetlights in this area, only the big moon in the sky is attached to that tall chimney, emitting a desolate glow. The light of the stars is dim and green, and the gloomy and uneven coal ash is slightly spread out in the sinister atmosphere. It's midnight, walking alone, the front is dark, and the following is also dark.</p>
<p>Turning a corner, it is still a fence, broken walls, factory buildings, and a rugged coal ash road. The smoke from the tall chimney still passes by, passing through the moonlight, as if covered by a layer of black gauze, even more dim. A feeling of depression overflows from my heart. Far away, a red star flickers. After walking a few steps forward, it is not a star, but a lamp, hanging under the eaves of a house. I am surprised that the family has not turned off the lights in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>When approaching that lamp, the midnight wind brings a tragic cry, like the cry for help from the victim of a robbery and murder, so sad that it makes people's hair stand on end and cold sweat seep from their pores. I am walking in front of the butcher shop, I dare not look directly at the door…</p>
<p>The tragic cry continues to come out of the door. Before my eyes, I vaguely see a bright sharp knife, a bucket of bright red blood, and the fierce face of a butcher. My body trembles, and I can't bear the gusts of wind blowing in the middle of the night. I can no longer bear to hear the death throes of the moment of killing, so I quicken my pace and walk forward like a fugitive. The front is dark, and the following is also dark.</p>
<p>There are no bright streetlights in this area.</p>
<h3 id="e208">A Portrait of Rural Bankruptcy <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhi</p>
<p>People who grow up in cities only hear about the economic bankruptcy of rural areas, but they don't know the reasons for it. To put it simply, on the one hand, they are subjected to the economic aggression of imperialism and heavy exploitation, which is already truly terrible. On the other hand, the gradual bankruptcy of national capital and the difficulty of selling domestic goods also inevitably affect the rural areas directly and indirectly. In addition, there are frequent wars and natural disasters in the country, which have already made farmers unable to lift their heads. What's more, there are also general gentry and landlords who force land rent and lend at high interest rates, all of which are intensifying exploitation and destruction. Farmers are under several layers of oppression. Can they still have a chance to be reborn? Even if there is an occasional bumper harvest, a group of unscrupulous merchants will take the opportunity to monopolize and suppress prices. As a result, a year of hard work is not only equivalent to white farming and white planting, but even their own land and property are completely exploited.</p>
<p>This is all a result of rural bankruptcy. Now, Mr. Li Pingqian, the director of the Mingxing Film Company, has made a film called "Golden Grain" based on these materials, which can be exposed on the screen so that everyone can see why the rural areas are bankrupt.</p>
<p>At this moment, "Golden Grain" will be shown publicly at the Xinguang Theater in this city.</p>

<p>Poems from Xuan Yin Cottage</p>
<p>Living in the countryside, I experience the four seasons, knowing the east wind first. Great is the power of creation, subtly rushing to Zhou Hongmeng. Taking care of things as if I have much leisure, I do not say that spring will end. A good time for a grand rite of spring purification, but I cannot follow the path of cultivation. Gazing at the clouds of Zhongshan, dense and rising high in the sky. Thinking of the Yonghe year, gatherings of gentlemen came to drink and chant, outstanding was Wang Youjun, his preface especially majestic, why grieve over life and death, anxiously caring for his own body? Could it be that he, a talented and elegant person, did not have a broad and open mind? Did he entrust his unrealized intentions to the vast and distant wild goose? The age of elegant style in the Eastern Jin Dynasty, deliberations were extremely high and lofty, looking up and down, they became past traces, endlessly for thousands of years. The Eight Kings and the Five Barbarians, how could one encounter careful beginnings? Great chaos lost the apes and cranes, what could there be for the sand worms? In the end, those who read later would be filled with emotion and tears would flow horizontally. The insignificant transmission of some books, the vulgar are startled by snake dragons, vast is the Yangtze River, flowing eastward for eternity, containing emotions that do not cease, who can see through it? In words beyond lamentations, the Way lies in not being stained by defilement or prosperity.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 29: Responding to the Oath with a Wounded Heart, Marking Myself as Living Alone. Listening to the Same Oath, Swearing Loyalty Together. Ji Zhi bowed to Madam Gan and smiled: Okay, thank you, Madam Liu. Let me be honest with you, I have figured it out now, I am not qualified to make friends, let alone get married. I am adhering to celibacy. Madam Gan laughed when she heard this: Don't mention this too early, mentioning it will make people laugh their teeth off. To be honest with you, I used to adhere to celibacy too, but now I have been a wife for many years. Men love every woman they see, how can you say that? Ji Zhi raised his head and smiled, Sister-in-law, look in the future. Saying this, he refused to talk more and went back to his room. In his heart, he thought that women like Yang Guizhi were somewhat unreliable, let alone others? If I cannot at least be an official with the rank of section chief, I don't have to think about getting close to women in this lifetime. With his hands behind his back, he paced back and forth in the room. Finally, he pulled out a stack of paper from the drawer, stood at the head of the table, picked up a pen, and wrote several slogans in succession, which read: The freest thing is celibacy, the noblest thing is celibacy, I only like living alone in the universe. These kinds of words all had the meaning of praising personal life. Not only did he write them, but he also posted them on the walls of the room. Standing in the middle of the room, he posted the slogans, read them, and shook his head, as if he was very proud of himself. Needless to say, this grumbling of his was entirely due to the letter from Yang Guizhi. But outside Xifengkou, in Ping'an Village, thirty miles away, slogans were also being posted. The person posting the slogans was none other than Yang Guizhi's husband, Zhao Ziqiang. His slogan also expressed the same sentiment as Gan Jizhi, namely, with the enemy in front, don't look back at home. That also meant that there was no need for love, but he was not doing public affairs. A slogan like this was posted high on the wall. (395)</p>

<h3 id="e211">A Record of Quietness in the Flower Mound <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>The faint setting sun is scattering on our bodies, on the white shirts fluttering in the light breeze, and it is not far from dusk. Dragging our rattan canes, after watching the reeds in Xixi, we returned along Qinting Mountain eastward, to a dilapidated roadside pavilion called "Kaihua." Monk Shipiao resolutely urged us to enter the Flower Mound to listen to the sound of the spring in the secluded ravine and the quiet chanting of the monks.</p>
<p>I had long read Qian Tang Chen Dian'an's miscellaneous poems about Xixi. His poems praising the Flower Mound jumped into my memory at this time. While following Shipiao, I silently recited:</p>
<p>Mountain villages are deep, this is even more secluded and winding. When the spring breeze arrives, it is like entering a valley of ten thousand flowers. The setting sun arrives late on the ground, outside the flowers are green peaks.</p>
<p>What meets the eye are deep green pines and cypresses and lush bamboo forests. In the distance and nearby, it is all cool shade. There is only a winding brick road, like a gray and white silver snake, becoming thinner and thinner as it goes up, and the thinner it gets, the more blurred it becomes. On the left and right are the mountain screens of Fahua Mountain, sealing off the entire Flower Mound with the dense green of the trees. Only where the bamboo and cypress are sparse can one look up and see one or two points of blue sky and the shadow of clouds that seem to exist and seem not to exist. There are not even the footprints of woodcutters here. We walked quietly, but the small streams hidden under the accumulated leaves under our feet, sometimes to the left and sometimes to the right, leaked out clear sounds like the strings of a zither, which really made people's bones feel comfortable.</p>
<p>There are also places where the high sky will write into the eyes, and a glimpse of a light and agile bird, the faint red evening glow, flows like a water rainbow towards our shirts, and everyone's body floats with a bright red. Moreover, the setting sun slants towards the west, secretly passing through the green forest, turning the leaves into the color of violet, and a cluster of white-walled thatched huts or the yellow-walled nunneries of nuns, set in the forest, add a layer of quiet, cool, and lonely mood.</p>
<p>Life in the deep mountains at dusk is no different from sitting in a large forest on a moonlit night and listening to one's own breathing, which is so calm. Almost the mountain spring is about to freeze. Occasionally, the sound of a hazy temple bell flies from afar, and the nearby bells continue to ring, but it is impossible to tell which thatched hut's bell it is, because all the thatched huts are hidden in unseen deep depressions. At this time, between the vast twilight sky and the narrow path, we smelled the smell of cooking smoke and saw the mountain smoke like a mirage, and the chanting of the monks also sounded one after another.</p>
<p>Unknowingly, lost in a deep dream, I ran towards the tip of Fahua Mountain with all my breath one day, and finally I realized the dumb drawing of the Flower Mound in the setting sun. When a dog barked from a villa buried in the golden sunlight on the top of the mountain, I suddenly looked up and saw three large characters in white on a black background: "Baiyun Dui" (White Cloud Pile). "We're here! Let's go up and borrow a place to stay." I really wanted to learn from the chickens and dogs of the King of Huainan and have a dream in the empty mulberry tree in Yin Huang. But Shipiao immediately said: The owner of Baiyun Dui lives in Hangzhou City and does not easily come here to enjoy a bit of non-worldly peace. The house is empty and there is no food or lodging available. When he said this, the excitement of coming up the mountain turned into wisps of smoke, and I couldn't wait to jump from the top of the mountain to the Kaihua Ancient Pavilion and take the bus from Xixi back to the lakeside. Why leave the house empty and not give it to yourself, and at the same time refuse others?</p>
<p>Seeing that the sky was really getting dark, although the night in the mountains was another wonderful scene, when we didn't bring flashlights and there was no moon in the sky, everyone fumbled down the mountain and couldn't succeed without falling down.</p>

<p>Dr. Wang Zhengting, the chief representative of our country's delegation to the 10th Far Eastern Games, along with all the athletes, returned to the country on the President Jackson some days ago. Except for the Guangdong and Hong Kong athletes who disembarked in Hong Kong on the 24th, the rest spent a night in Hong Kong and then took the original ship to Shanghai. They arrived in port yesterday afternoon. Mayor Wu, on behalf of Zhang Tingrong, and others welcomed them. There were five or six hundred people. After disembarking, the athletes from this city returned home or to school separately, while the athletes from other cities stayed at the YMCA, rested for a night, and then returned to their respective provinces separately. The China National Amateur Athletic Federation also held a banquet at the New Asia Restaurant last night to welcome Mayor Wu and all the delegation, and to entertain reporters from various newspapers. The delegation reported on the experience of attending the Games. Details of each situation are recorded below.</p>

<p>All the athletes of our country's delegation to the Far Eastern Games returned to the country on the President Jackson. It was originally scheduled to arrive in port at 1:00 PM yesterday, but because the weather was fine yesterday, it entered the port at 9:00 AM and stopped at Floating Pontoon No. 16 in Yangshupu. They took a small boat and disembarked at the Customs Wharf at about 12:00 PM. Many representatives from all walks of life went to the ship's port and took small boats to welcome them. They included Mayor Wu's representative Zhang Tingrong, as well as Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Ming, Liu Yunfang, Wu Kaisheng, Ren Tianfang,</p>
<p>as well as representatives from the City Party Headquarters, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese YMCA, the Baihong Sports Association, the Qinfen Bookstore, and various schools, and reporters from various newspapers, about five or six</p>

<p>The company's small boat docked at the New Customs Wharf at about 12:00 PM. All the welcoming personnel stepped forward to shake hands and express their condolences. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in port at 1:30 PM yesterday. Later, because it arrived early, the Federation's authorities did not have time to notify, so many of the welcoming personnel failed to arrive in time. After 1:30 PM, the wharf was still crowded, and representatives of various countries continued to</p>

<p>After disembarking, the male and female athletes from other cities took pre-arranged cars and returned to the YMCA on Baxianqiao and the Women's Apartment on Pobo Road to rest. The athletes from this city, as well as Wang Zhengting, Shen Siliang, Zhou Jiaqi, and others, went directly to their private residences. The luggage was taken care of by Chen Bingde and transported to the YMCA and the Federation by the China Travel Service, waiting for the athletes to pick them up.</p>

<p>The North China athletes are scheduled to take the Shanghai-Ping train at 4:00 PM today, led by Coach Ma Yuehan, to go north. There are more than 80 representatives arriving in port this time. Li Huitang, Tan Jiangbai, Ye Beihua, Liu Mao, etc., were unable to come with them. Situ Guang and Luo Qing were temporarily staying in Guangdong. The athletes were full of energy and beautifully dressed, but their faces were darker than when they left. It is said that it was due to the hot climate in the south.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Wang Zhengting Talks About Japan and the Philippines' Absurdity <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Zhengting, the chief representative of our country, said to reporters yesterday that this time Japan colluded with the Philippines to illegally dissolve the Far Eastern Games, which have a history of more than 20 years, with a small number of members. Our country absolutely cannot recognize this. The Philippines and Japan's desire to withdraw from the Far Eastern Games is their own right within their scope, and our country cannot interfere. If they want to dissolve the Far Eastern Games based on the approval of the two countries, it is not known where their power comes from. It is really absurd. Whether the Far Eastern Games can be restored and preserved, and whether the Philippines' attitude can be salvaged and changed, are all between possible and impossible. Before leaving the Philippines, I (Wang's self-称) had a conversation with Quezon, the President of the Philippine Senate. Quezon was still ill and had not recovered, but he was very clear about right and wrong and felt regret and remorse for the actions of the Philippine Athletic Federation. How the future of the Far Eastern Games will develop is still under negotiation. Wang said at the Customs Wharf yesterday to reporters from various newspapers that the Far Eastern Games are a part of the World Games, and our country is a member of the World Games, so we have decided to submit this matter to the World Olympic Games for resolution. Even if we do not get justice, we will have to think of other ways. However, it will take four years to convene the next Games. During this period, how will personnel change, and how will the international situation change? All of these cannot be predicted. Consider how Germany in 1914 differed from Germany in 1918 in those four years. This is a lesson from the past. Our country and the Philippines have always had extremely friendly relations. This time, the Philippines was deceived by Japan, resulting in this incident. Afterwards, the Filipinos also regretted it. Our country will still take the responsibility of the host country for the next Games and strive to prepare and invite various member countries to participate. I know that the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines will be able to participate. If Japan is unwilling, then so be it.</p>

<p>Hao Gengsheng, the representative of our country, said that in this Far Eastern Games, our country can be said to have still achieved victory in defeat. The spirit of perseverance and refusing to participate in the pseudo-organization has remained consistent from beginning to end. Although Japan was able to collude with the Philippines to illegally dissolve the Far Eastern Games, it will never be able to make our country's fighting spirit submit. Hao has already returned to Beijing by night train last night to report to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3 id="e220">(Shen Siliang Talks About Public Opinion Support) <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Shen Siliang, the main director of the National Amateur Athletic Federation of our country, shouldered a heavy responsibility in the plenary meeting of the executive committee this time because the chief representative, Dr. Wang Zhengting, was unable to attend due to illness, and fought bravely against the illegal elements. His spirit is commendable. Shen said that the actions of our country's delegation in the Philippines this time were able to gain the support of the public opinion circles, and all unanimously condemned the illegal actions of Japan and the Philippines. The Manila Daily Bulletin even published a strong editorial attacking the Philippine sports authorities. Shen specially distributed the original text of the newspaper to reporters from various newspapers for reference.</p>

<p>Head coach Ma Yuehan said that in this Far Eastern Games, our country has made significant progress. For example, Chen Baoqiu's iron ball and Fu Baolu's pole vault, although ranked second, have not yet reached their personal best records. In addition, there are several athletes who, although they did not score, were able to exceed the national records, which is very commendable. Liu Changchun's failure was indeed due to being overweight, so his results could not match others. As for Leng Peigen and Situ Guang, it was expected that they would be able to score, but unfortunately, they were nervous before the battle and played wildly. After a long period of training, there is great hope for the future.</p>

<p>At 7:00 PM last night, the China National Amateur Athletic Federation held a banquet at the New Asia Restaurant to welcome Mayor Wu, the delegation's staff, and the athletes, as well as reporters from various newspapers. More than 100 people, including Mayor Wu, attended. Wang Zhengting personally hosted the event. During the banquet, Wang reported on the experience of attending the Games.</p>
<h3 id="e223">(Account of Attending the Far Eastern Games) <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>In short, I knew there would be many difficulties attending the Far Eastern Games, including not only the Games themselves but also political difficulties. Before the meeting, Japan had already proposed the participation of a puppet organization. At that time, Japan sent Yamamoto to our country and the Philippines to lobby for this. We sternly rejected their proposal, and the Philippines also denied it based on their regulations. Therefore, the round table conference was held in Shanghai and was ultimately rejected. However, Japan did not give up. Thus, starting from May 19th, during the representatives' meeting held in the Philippines, Japan was the first to propose amending Article 3 of the regulations and demanded a vote based on the provision of Article 14, which required a two-thirds vote of the attending members. However, I declared that the regulations could not be changed without unanimous approval. By the third meeting, the Philippines, knowing that amending the regulations could not achieve their goals, did not modify Article 3 but instead changed Article 10, adding the phrase "or specially invited to participate" to the original text of the first clause, "Only amateur athletes who are members of this association may participate in the Far Eastern Games." Our representative immediately questioned, "Who has the right to invite?" The Japanese representative was speechless and remained silent for a long time, but still insisted on putting it to a vote. Our side immediately declared that if a vote was taken, we would withdraw from the meeting. This would mean that the quorum for the meeting would not be met. However, the chairman did not consider this and abruptly put it to a vote. Our representative immediately withdrew from the meeting. However, our representative withdrew from the meeting, not from the Games itself, so we absolutely do not recognize the illegal dissolution by Japan and the Philippines. After our withdrawal, Japan and the Philippines held two more private meetings, deciding to dissolve the Far Eastern Games and organize the so-called East Asian Amateur Games. We immediately protested and submitted it to the current chairman, Philippine President Quezon. He also expressed dissatisfaction with this matter and promised to consider it further. Therefore, I have a very solid legal argument on this matter. However, the future development and extent of this are still unpredictable. I will continue to report on the future progress.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang continued to state the attitude of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation, saying that our country and the Philippines had jointly founded the Far Eastern Games more than 20 years ago. If someone destroys it, the responsibility for the destruction certainly does not lie with us. Once it is destroyed by someone, we should strive to preserve it. Therefore, if it can be preserved, we should try our best. If we cannot preserve it, it is not a pity. Our country's promotion of sports should strive to make it widespread and must start with young children to solidify the foundation. We must also have a long-term vision and pay attention to the world. With our country's large population, if we work hard to promote sports, we should be able to occupy a place in the world's games.</p>

<p>Next, Mayor Wu Tiecheng delivered a speech, briefly stating that the athlete representatives were passing through Shanghai on their return to China. He had originally intended to host a banquet to fulfill his duty as the host, but the athletes from various regions were eager to return home and could not fulfill his wishes, which he was very sorry for. Next year, the National Games will be held in Shanghai, and representatives from various provinces will be able to attend. At that time, they can gather in one place and he will host them again. He then said that the survival of the nation and the rise and fall of the people are not accidental. If we can act according to principles, we will certainly become strong. Our country has faced great difficulties due to various past darknesses. However, if we can overcome this difficulty, the future will be infinitely bright. Our country's future depends on the youth of the country, especially the students in school. Education is the central undertaking of society, and student activities are also the central activities of society. If young students can get on the right track, the undertakings of the country and society will develop vigorously. At the end, Wang Zhengting led the crowd in shouting "Long live the Republic of China" three times and dispersed.</p>

<p>According to a certain gentleman in the delegation speaking to reporters,</p>
<p>This time, the Philippine authorities succumbed to the Japanese side and accepted their illegal demands, dissolving the Games. The people of the Philippines strongly opposed this. Local newspapers criticized this arrogant move, and the Manila Daily Bulletin believed that this action by Japan and the Philippines was tantamount to expressing "cowardice and unreliability" towards our country. Most officials in the Philippine sports community also believed that this move was a disgrace to the country. However, the Philippine authorities did this with political motives. The Philippines' request for independence had just been recognized by the U.S. government. When Philippine President Quezon returned from the United States, he passed through Japan, where he may have reached a tacit agreement with Japan. Therefore, Philippine newspapers accused the authorities of having a prior agreement. However, Japan's threats were very blatant. At a certain banquet, the Japanese consul in Manila said, "Today, Japan has sent more than 170 athletes to participate in the competition, which is very joyful. If we sent more than 170 warships here, what would you think?" and "The Philippines is about to become independent and must maintain friendly relations with neighboring Japan." The Philippine authorities were ultimately coerced and willingly echoed Japan, and their fear of Japan is evident.</p>

<p>Que Ke Ling Defeats Sun Daosheng</p>
<p>Bao Shanli Defeats Zhu Kuan</p>
<p>In the first Shanghai Open Handball Tournament, the match between youth and veteran players Sun Daosheng and Western Youth Champion Que Ke Ling was very intense. They won one game each, showing how fierce the competition was. Que was fierce and good at fighting, and his right-handed bottom kill was unmatched for a time. Sun was good at using tricks and specialized in attacking the left side, killing whenever there was an opportunity. Que won the first game with a score of 21 to 16. Sun won the second game with a score of 21 to 14. At the beginning of the third game, the difference in scores was very close. However, after reaching the teens, Sun's physical strength was insufficient and he failed. Que won again with a score of 21 to 13. In the singles match between Zhu Kuan and Bao Shanli, something abnormal happened. Zhu Kuan was unexpectedly defeated by a score of 0 to 2. In terms of skill and experience, Bao was far inferior to Zhu. Perhaps Zhu's bad luck was upon him and he made consecutive mistakes. This can be seen in the first game, which was 21 to 23, and the second game, which was 17 to 21. However, Zhu Kuan's hope for a trophy still exists. However, the order sheet outside the handball room stated that Bao Shanli lost to Kramer and then withdrew from the competition due to illness against Luo Tai. As Luo Tai left Shanghai, Zhu Kuan, Sun Daosheng, and Que Ke Ling are left to compete. Today, the sports officer of the association stated that Luo Tai withdrew against Bao Shanli. Who is responsible for the error in the order? Today's doubles competition features Kramer and Ma Luofu against Que Ke Ling and Bao Shanli.</p>

<p>Xu Chengji Loses to Lin Baohua Due to Travel Fatigue</p>
<p>Xu-Qiu Team Wins 2-1 Against Lin-Zheng Team</p>
<p>The China Tennis Club officially opened yesterday, inviting our country's Far Eastern Games athletes Xu Chengji, Qiu Feihai, the Wang sisters Chunwei and Chunjing, and Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia to perform. The usually deserted Singapore Road suddenly became congested with cars, greatly increasing the liveliness. There were about four to five hundred spectators. Xu and Qiu had just arrived in Shanghai at noon and were fatigued from the journey, resulting in reduced performance. In the singles match, Lin Baohua won 6-3, 6-1 against Xu Chengji. In the doubles match, the Xu-Qiu team won 2-1 against the Lin-Zheng team. Finally, Xu and Ms. Wang Chunwei played a mixed doubles match against Lin Baohua and Wang Chunjing to add to the fun. As a result, the Xu-Wang team won 6-4. As for the construction of the courts, it is not yet fully completed. The stands and court structure are very exquisite. However, the courts are very loose and must be properly maintained. The details of the competition are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Lin Baohua Defeats Xu Chengji <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Xu's hitting technique seems to have improved compared to the National Games. However, due to travel fatigue and reduced energy, he seemed to be struggling. Lin Baohua, on the other hand, was well-rested and naturally had an advantage. The performances of both were very outstanding. Their shots were fierce and confident, and their serves were especially characteristic, making for a rare and wonderful performance. As a result, Lin won 6-3, 6-1.</p>
<p>First Set: Lin served first and won easily. Xu returned the favor in the same way. Lin then won the serving game with a slide. Xu also added a game, making it 2-2. The two gradually engaged in a fierce battle. However, Xu showed signs of fatigue and lost three consecutive games, giving Lin the victory at 6-3.</p>
<p>Second Set: After a short rest, the competition continued. Xu lost repeatedly, except for winning the first serving game, losing six consecutive games. Because his arm strength decreased, he could not control the ball, resulting in repeated mistakes. In addition, Lin's vigor was strong, and his backhand and forehand shots were more advanced than before, making Xu struggle to cope. Lin then won again with a score of 6-1.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Doubles Review: Qiu Wins Against Lin Zheng <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>After the singles match, the doubles match began. Xu Aji and Qiu Feihai teamed up to fight Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia. It was far less exciting than the singles match. Qiu's performance was greatly reduced, and he completely lost control, with many self-kills and net balls. Zheng Zhaojia was sometimes good and sometimes bad, with no certainty, but his serves were quite good. Lin and Zheng could have won, but unexpectedly, they were defeated. Xu and Qiu won 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.</p>
<p>First Set: Lin served first and immediately won a game. Xu relied on the power of his serve to win a point. However, Lin and Zheng's cooperation was excellent, and they used fierce attacks. Xu and Qiu made repeated mistakes and were at a loss. Lin and Zheng won 6-1 easily.</p>
<p>Second Set: Xu and Qiu gradually cheered up. Zheng Zhaojia made repeated mistakes, and Lin also lost his calm attitude. Xu and Qiu's fierce attacks left them unable to support themselves, forming a situation of 5-1. Lin and Zheng worked hard to cheer up, sweeping shots to both sides or the center. The ball was very fast and often had miraculous effects, but they only caught up two games and were eventually defeated by Xu and Qiu with a score of 6-3.</p>
<p>Third Set: Lin and Zheng continued to make mistakes. Wild balls and net balls reappeared repeatedly, almost completely losing control. Xu and Qiu again took the lead with a score of 5-1. In the sixth game, Xu won four consecutive points with his serve, earning a lot of applause. However, in the seventh game, Lin also won the game with his serve. In the next game, both sides showed great skill in blocking and high-pressure shots. Lin and Zheng added two more games, eventually losing 4-6.</p>

<p>Finally, a mixed doubles match was played to add to the fun. Xu Chengji and Wang Qing played against Lin Baohua and Wang Chunjing, but the performance was ordinary, with no interest. The audience gradually dispersed, so only one set was played. As a result, the Xu-Wang team won 6-4.</p>

<p>News of the tenth anniversary of the Southeast Women's Physical Education Normal School in Jiangwan has already been reported in this newspaper. At 6:30 PM the day before yesterday (27th), the school held a physical education performance. More than 6,000 people came from afar to admire it, and the scene was extremely lively. In addition to the Boy Scout Security Corps and the police maintaining order, many receptionists were also assigned, so the order at the venue was very good. Under the shining lights, the students of the school took turns performing. There were more than 30 kinds of programs, all kinds of which were dazzling. Among them, the Danish exercises, parallel bars, vaulting horse, singing and dancing, peacock dance, butterfly love flower, and various national customs were the most wonderful, which are rare in Shanghai. Coupled with the ups and downs of the music and the colorful dance costumes, it is even more refreshing and pleasing to the eye, earning a lot of applause. As for the performances of Erlang boxing and Taijiquan, the movements were neat and the techniques were pure and skilled, which was especially commendable. At the end, guest Qiu Menghen performed a piano solo, and Li Defu performed two pieces of Fanya violin, which added a lot of color to the meeting. By the time the performance ended, it was already 11 o'clock, and the guests left happily.</p>

<p>5:30 PM at the China Football Field</p>
<p>The first city-wide workers' games organized by the Shanghai General Labor Union has a total of five championship events this year. Except for the three track and field and tennis events, which have all ended one after another, the football and basketball events will also be completely resolved within this week. The toothbrush and postal workers' unions have obtained the right to compete in the football final, which is scheduled to be held at the China Football Field at 5:30 PM tomorrow. Chen Jixiang from the China Sports Referees Association will be hired as the referee, and Rui Jinxian and Ding Shunbao will be the linesmen. According to the average strength of the two teams, it is difficult to predict who will win the championship. The competition will definitely be fierce at that time.

<p>Wu Xingya Gave a Lecture at the Law School Yesterday</p>
<p>The Spirit and Action of the National Revival Movement</p>
<p>The Modern Thought Society held its 7th lecture at the Law School Auditorium yesterday at 11:00 AM. Mr. Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, was specially invited to give the lecture. More than 500 members of the society and students from the Law School attended. The event began with introductory remarks by Wang Longzhang, Executive Director of the Society, and Shen Juru, Dean of the Law School. The lecture, recorded by Chen Dongbai, was titled "The Spirit and Action of the National Revival Movement." It briefly stated that at a time when the slogan of the national revival movement is sweeping the country, especially college students and young revolutionary comrades have a fervent sympathy under this slogan and actively engage in its realization. However, to realize this movement, we must establish a solid foundation in both spirit and action to define our goals and steps. Otherwise, it can easily become chaotic and disorganized like the revolutionary movements of the past twenty years, leading to many unexpected events. First, let me talk about the spirit of the national revival movement. Sun Yat-sen's motivation for revolution stemmed from the fact that since the Opium War, the nation and the country have been declining day by day. The Qing government was muddle-headed and confused, and international imperialism was actively invading. Recognizing the crisis of the nation's future, he determined that the national revolution should start with the ethnic revolution. Through three to forty years of continuous effort, with a spirit of perseverance, he overcame many difficult and challenging environments. Therefore, today, in carrying out the national revival movement, we must take the spirit of the Premier as the fundamental spirit. Under the leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Chiang, we must unite and first establish a foundation for the spirit of the national revival movement so that this movement can achieve its goal. Second, the action of the national revival movement. Action is the most urgent need. Having the spirit of the national revival movement, we must have practical action. The general malady of the Chinese people is that they can talk but not act. The reason for the failure of the past revolutionary movements lies in this. From now on, when we engage in the national revival movement, we must bury our heads in hard work and not just talk empty words. The perilousness of the international situation, the urgency of the world war crisis in 1936, the survival or death of the Chinese nation all depend on whether we are prepared today to cope with this overall situation as a turning point. Now, looking around China, internally, the communist bandits have not been eradicated; externally, national defense is empty. The last thing I want to say to you is that the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang is the basic work of the national revival movement, and it can also be said to be the mobilization meeting of the national revival movement. It requires the entire nation, every individual, to start from themselves. I hope that everyone will carefully read the outline of the New Life Movement and proceed step by step from the easy to the difficult. The first step is to transform the individual, and the second step is to transform the society. Only then will the foundation of the national revival movement be sound, and only then can it achieve its goal.</p>

<p>— Ana</p>
<p>If Ana were to transform into a lady, she would definitely not love this kind of young man:</p>
<p>In terms of appearance, neither tall nor short, neither too fat nor too thin, long hair, combed and shiny; delicate eyebrows and eyes, a pointed nose; a round face, often coated with "Butterfly Cream" or similar; a Western suit, faintly fragrant, ironed straight, leather shoes that squeak, always wearing white gloves in all seasons, a cigarette hanging from his mouth, glasses on his nose, and silver dollars always jingling in his pocket...</p>
<p>In short, the epitome of fashion, discarded like worn-out shoes. Why? Because of deep disgust! One should not judge by appearances, but that refers to natural appearance. Natural appearance may be beautiful or ugly, and there is nothing one can do about it. But people always wear clothes, and once they wear clothes, the difference between high and low becomes apparent. There is the so-called high that is actually base and vulgar; and there is the so-called low that is actually noble and refined. Common people look at clothes to distinguish between the rich and the poor, which is not delving deep enough. It seems that many young people today could do without dressing like that.</p>
<p>Secondly, this kind of "generic product" is useless, always accommodating in every way, without one's own subjective opinions, without ideas. Their hearts are muddled, hence their round faces. Manifesting on the face and swelling in the back, the ancients emphasized that a person's cultivation can be seen somewhat from the outside, no matter how deep and silent they may be. Those who are useless cannot succeed in their work. Those who listen to others' commands will never achieve anything.</p>
<p>Thirdly, this type of person lacks depth, not loving enough, nor hating deeply enough. "Fickle as waterweed," the ancients scolded women, but it is appropriate to transfer this to modern young people today. If they are taught to obey, their temperament is of great concern. If they can obey me, how do I know they will not obey others? Therefore, the ancients had deep meaning in training servants and inspiring loyalty. There is also another layer; the good is never beautiful, and the beautiful is never true. Truth, goodness, and beauty can never be united. If there is truly such a thing as love, it does not arise from beauty, but from truth and from goodness. All these modern manners are just like fleeting smoke, here one moment and gone the next.</p>
<p>With these reasons, I deeply abhor and detest them.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Random Memories of Liang Garden <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Youjun</p>
<p>1.  Second Hometown</p>
<p>Whenever someone asks about my hometown, after answering "X County," I think in my heart: I should say Kaifeng!</p>
<p>Yes, I miss Kaifeng, I miss the clear spring waters of Pan Yang Lake, I miss the ancient and lonely Yuwang Platform, I miss the Qilu Park with its blooming spring flowers, I miss the imposing Iron Pagoda. In this desert-like spring beyond the border.</p>
<p>Leaving my hometown, the first city I stepped into was Kaifeng. There, I received modern education, and there, I spent several years of wandering. There, I drank the sweet wine of love and the bitter wine of love, I tasted the warmth of human affection and the coolness of human affection. However, this stranger in this wandering year finally left this hometown-like alien land and drifted to another alien land.</p>
<p>The fragrant grass at the edge of the world, the ancient post station in the setting sun, whenever I wake up from a midnight dream with a lonely lamp like a bean, I think of Kaifeng.</p>
<p>Ah, the second hometown that binds people's dreams!</p>
<p>2.  Pan Yang Lake</p>
<p>"Looking afar, the lofty and cold tower overlooks Bianzhou, the Fantai Iron Pagoda floats with the clouds, ten thousand families have no trees and no palaces, only the Yellow River rolls on."</p>
<p>This is Kang Youwei's poem inscribed at Longting. It is carved on the stone archway east of Longting. After Longting Park was changed to Zhongshan Park, many slogans overthrew the ancient and elegant couplets, only it still survived, adorning the remnants of boiling cranes and burning zithers.</p>
<p>As the poem says: in autumn, you walk on this old Longting, look at the high and empty sky, the vast clouds and mist shrouded ten thousand houses, only the Iron Pagoda stands alone like a crane in a flock of chickens. The wild geese in the air are loud. At this time, you look around,</p>
<p>Truly have the feeling of "thinking of the vastness of heaven and earth, feeling alone and weeping."</p>
<p>Down Longting, the arrangement of this so-called park, flowers and trees are chaotic, vulgar. Out of the park, two autumn waters on both sides of the road are Pan Yang Lake. In the past, there was a legend of Yang Qing and Pan Zhuo, but now they are both equally turbid green. At this time, the west wind blows the clothes, cool into the skin, if you sit alone in a small boat, paddling leisurely, Yanghu South has the pavilion of the Henan Library protruding into the lake, in the middle is a newly built thatched pavilion, to the north is reeds, water birds floating. A lonely boat in the middle of the stream, cool wind sleeves, fluttering like riding the wind. If you are not tired of swimming, you can turn back to the lake, driven from under the bridge into the Pan Lake. Putting in the middle, looking around the water and sky, the northwest corner of the city is desolate. The setting sun reflects into the water, brilliant as gold. The sound of pounding clothes on the lake side is bleak, unbearable. If you have read the Book of Songs, you will probably sing the poems of autumn water and reeds with a sigh.</p>
<p>What I can never forget is the dusk of the autumn of the eighteenth year: I went with a few friends, walking along the lake in the yellow light of the setting sun, tired and leaning on the bridge, suddenly glimpsed that Ying, who had already broken off contact, came slowly with a few classmates, when our sight met, she turned back and went away.</p>
<p>Last year, I came to Liangyuan again, revisiting the old trails, already gone without a trace, face peach, only increased the sigh!</p>
<p>Now wandering in the border, lonely and bleak, the past is like a dream, once a thought, once lost.</p>
<p>3.  Yuwang Platform</p>
<p>Into the Henan Agricultural and Forestry Experimental Field, past a small river artificially excavated, you will see a few rows of weeping willows dancing in the wind, Yuwang Terrace is towering in the green willows. Into the fight, is the wooden square of "Ancient Blowing Terrace". On the stage is the Yuwang Temple. In front of the temple gate are two drum-like pieces of wood, said to be things from the time when Yuwang controlled the water. Police are stationed in the main hall of Chao Nei, prohibiting visitors from entering the temple, and there is a stone tablet with Kang Youwei's inscription on the east corridor. Behind the temple is a so-called Imperial Stele Pavilion, with a poem carved on the stele by Qianlong, which seems to make sense but does not. Ancient cypresses soar into the sky on the stage, looking around, you can see ten thousand houses and trees, hazy and vast. The wilderness is wide and the sky is low, the sound of the wind enters the ear, making people feel with emotion.</p>
<p>In the summer of the eighteenth year, because of the impact of the situation, when we felt that the school was about to dissolve, I strolled on Yuwang Terrace. I met Kui and Zhi next to the tea pavilion, walking leisurely by the man-made river, watching the gurgling water. They were wearing the same blue cloth uniforms of the school. If you had never met them, you would have doubted that they were students of the same sex. At that time, I looked at Kui and nodded, he smiled unnaturally and walked away.</p>
<p>In those days, among the classmates, who did not envy this pair of young lovers! However, human affairs are difficult to know. Who would have thought that in the following year, they would break off contact because of family relations? Later, when I talked to Kui about their relationship, I asked him about his impression of that trip, he just pondered silently.</p>
<p>Now Kui has been newly married for several years, but I know: he will not forget Zhi.</p>
<p>May all lovers in the world become families!</p>
<p>4.  Qilu Park</p>
<p>Picking up the pen, I wanted to recount the travels of Qilu Park in the season of blooming spring flowers, but when I thought of Qiu, who had traveled with me, had passed away, I couldn't stop the dark tears falling!</p>
<p>Qiu, your white bones may have been transformed, but your pure love will always exist in my thoughts. Especially that trip together.</p>
<p>I still remember: at that time, we came out of Songmen, passed through a few deserted streets, and then arrived at Qilu Park. At the gate was a cluster of rockery, strange rocks standing tall. In the garden, flowers are dense, and on the man-made river, there is a pavilion, now I can not remember the names of these terraces. We walked through the flower path, wandering between the flowerbeds and sparse bamboo. Around the woods in the north, around the grape racks in the south. Resting under a thatched pavilion. Silently watching the blooming spring flowers. Watching the colorful butterflies flying. After a while of rest, we silently left this garden and went home, treading on the warm sunshine.</p>
<p>Human affairs are like turning into a moth. I finally failed her and drifted to the edge of the world alone.</p>
<p>The year before last, I received the news of her death; without sorrow, without pain, I was silent for a few days, quietly shedding tears.</p>
<p>I never had the opportunity to make up for it!</p>
<p>This regret should be until the end of time.</p>
<p>5.  Iron Pagoda</p>
<p>In the desolate northeast corner of Kaifeng, what can still attract a few tourists every day is the imposing Iron Pagoda.</p>
<p>Under that blue sky, the Iron Pagoda stands tremblingly. Looking from afar: behind the few lonely temples, stands a dark mass, layer by layer rushing into the sky? If you walk to the bottom of the tower and look up, you can't see the top of the tower, you will doubt that it has rushed to God's throne.</p>
<p>Into the tower gate, inside is dark, if you see the light, you have reached the first floor of the tower. If you have the courage, it is best to climb straight to the top of the tower, on that tower peak: the panorama of Kaifeng will unfold before your eyes, in the mist, you can vaguely see the ancient Longting, fish-scale-like houses, factory chimneys, Zhongshan University (should be Henan University) auditorium, like an inverted face basin. To the north of the tower, it is desolate, the distant clouds and trees are hazy, there is a river like a line, that is the Yellow River. At this time, if the day is about to end, you can see the clouds shining, the setting sun like a golden basin, bursts of returning crows noisy night, "the sunset is infinitely good, but near dusk!" You will be quiet and happy.</p>
<p>After climbing the tower, the travel interest is tired, if you do not feel leg sour bones after the tower, then I really want to give you a thumbs up, say a "admire"!</p>
<p>But at this time I am in the border, away from Bian thousands of miles, I know when can I come to Liangyuan again to quickly ascend!</p>
<p>Ah, Iron Pagoda, I hope you will not be washed away by the turbid currents of the Yellow River, we will always have a future. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e252">Home, Bodhisattva, Opium <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan Ren</p>
<p>In northern Sichuan, the three major topics of home, Bodhisattva, and opium are struggling, and the crux of the great contradictions is appearing from time to time. Although there are more important and significant issues, more than just the three: home, Bodhisattva, and opium! But as far as my prejudice extends, I only like to talk about this. Traveling thousands of miles away, I can't help but gently sing the poem East and West, Home is Best. But in the places I have arrived, they are doing their best to abolish the home. The people of northern Sichuan, like me, are typical Chinese temperaments, willing to starve to death rather than leave their not-so-good old home. Therefore, those who advocate abolishing the home become their enemies. Those who advocate abolishing the home want to eliminate the ethical relationships of father and son, husband and wife, and so on, but the Chinese, who advocate ruling the country by managing the family, fundamentally do not want to do this. Whether in power or out of power, whether scholars or laborers, the Chinese want to maintain family relations for thousands of years to come. The Chinese Republic lasts for ten thousand years is what they shout on the surface, but the longevity of my family and the longevity of my flesh and blood descendants are what they truly believe. This is a self-evident and supremely authoritative doctrine, and with this doctrine, no matter what doctrine can beat it. Because northern Sichuan is China, naturally there can be no exception, so once the enemy withdraws from northern Sichuan, the family is the only weapon to resist the enemy!</p>
<p>China does not have religion, if it does, it is only the external Bodhisattva. The people of northern Sichuan are as devout to the Bodhisattva as those who believe in the Bodhisattva elsewhere. Therefore, those who destroy the Bodhisattva are their enemies. Since the enemy came, although the temple exists, the Bodhisattva is gone. Land gods, Guanyin, Arhats, Ksitigarbha, all suffered misfortune and were thrown into the pit, but all the stone walls were engraved with enemy slogans. In this way, our devout believers in the Bodhisattva are unwilling to comply, hence the contradiction, and the struggle. As a result of the contradiction and struggle, most of the devout believers in the Bodhisattva have triumphed again.</p>
<p>Smokers are prevalent in northern Sichuan. Among all coolies, eight or nine out of ten are opium smokers. They love opium as much as their lives. Whoever does not want opium is whoever does not want their lives. Opium has become a second life, no wonder they curse the eradication of opium seedlings! It should be said that opium is cheap to one big copper coin a mouthful, three big copper coins a cup. Although the income of coolies is small, it is naturally more than enough to deal with such cheap opium! In the enemy's land, not a single opium seedling can be seen, which shows the strength of its eradication, but the most unwelcome are the majority of northern Sichuan smokers. They believe that this is tantamount to destroying their lives. The most ridiculous thing is that because of their belief in the Bodhisattva, they took their most precious opium and smeared it all over the unspoken mouths of the Bodhisattvas, black opium paste replacing red animal blood. This strange phenomenon is most seen in Guangyuan County, which is close to Shaanxi and Gansu. According to the locals, the "Bodhisattva" is not effective without eating "opium" smoke, and cannot bless their "home." Alas! Opium, Bodhisattva, home, the three formed such an important relationship.</p>
<p>The Republic of China is thus saved!</p>

<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>One day, A-Mei was hit by a playing companion, and anger filled her two cheeks. She immediately ran to Grandma Huang, and cried leaning against her knees.</p>
<p>"Hurry up and shut up. You can't take being hit once? Who told your parents to take fifty dollars and then not want you?" Grandma Huang said angrily, annoyed by the disturbance, and then bent her fingers to count: "Huang A-Sheng owes five dou, Chen Yong owes four dou three sheng..."</p>
<p>A-Mei was startled by this cold treatment. She raised her tearful eyes and looked questioningly at the woman immersed in bitter calculations, her mind returning to her aunt's place.</p>
<p>"Why are you being so dull?" Grandma Huang shouted.</p>
<p>"I, I, why hasn't Aunt come yet, will Dad take me back?"</p>
<p>"Ha! Don't dream," the woman smiled casually, "pick up the broom and sweep the floor, listen to me, if you're afraid of being beaten, don't go outside..."</p>
<p>The earth is like a waterwheel, days are moved away one by one, and the growing child also gradually moves the world she lives in into her simple mind. Obviously, A-Mei's life experience is increasing day by day. Besides her aunt and Liu Fuhe, there are still many things that she can't figure out even after daydreaming for a long time; her not-so-well-nourished body also takes on part of the daily affairs.</p>
<p>Every night, when Grandpa Huang and his wife slept in bed, A-Mei took turns in the middle to beat their bones, and the adults often ridiculed his tenant farmers with excitement, and sought pleasant data from the miserable facts. These constant cruel laughs and scolds often scorched A-Mei's suppressed heart, but the result of the struggle between her inner heart and external forces often made her tired. Once, she beat Grandpa Huang's urinating device, and Grandma Huang's face turned blue and white:</p>
<p>"You little bitch, good, don't sleep tonight!"</p>
<p>She used a rope to tie A-Mei to the wooden pillar near the door, put out the lights and went to sleep, until A-Mei cried as if she had been grabbed by evil ghosts, then she untied her.</p>
<p>The bustling situation of the market and all the complex sounds of the people, the groans of the poor, could not blow into Grandpa Huang's house. In this lonely hell where no light can be seen, A-Mei is exploring something that she doesn't understand and is eager for. In A-Mei's eyes, the only woman in the house who cooks becomes a closest friend.</p>
<p>"Sister, when you go to buy vegetables, take me out for a walk." A-Mei earnestly asked.</p>
<p>"A twelve or thirteen-year-old child, can't you go by yourself?" The second sister said, looking at A-Mei, and after a while, she gently shook her head and said, "I think you're like a chicken in a cage! I tell you, people can't live like this," the second sister continued to say to A-Mei, who was impatient to listen, "just like a chicken, raised in a cage until it's fat, and when people kill it and cook it to eat, although they praise it for being fat and tender, what about the chicken itself? Not to mention that, chickens are for people to eat, but people have souls!"</p>
<p>A-Mei gradually grew thin and long, but she didn't know where her soul was hiding. Her eyes looked at the things she came into contact with blankly and timidly. Her duties also increased with her height. Grandma Huang said smugly to her husband:</p>
<p>"The one in our family is as good as a working bull, but she's very stupid, she really only takes one step after being beaten! Her gloomy eyes are really annoying, I don't know what she's being dazed about all day long, this kind of person doesn't seem to have good fortune!"</p>
<p>In the year when A-Mei was seventeen, it didn't rain for three whole months, and the soil in the paddy fields was like the cracked feet of a farmer in winter: the tenant farmers who had "taken over" Grandpa Huang's fields came to Grandpa Huang's door with bitter faces. They all ran out because the landlord ignored them.</p>
<p>"A-Mei, if a tenant farmer comes to find me, say I'm not at home!" Grandpa Huang ordered loudly.</p>
<p>Having received the order, he sat at the door, mending his own clothes.</p>
<p>Deng Shiye, who often came, appeared in front of A-Mei with dense steps, his eyes flashing wantonly under the gold-rimmed glasses, and said: "Is Grandpa Huang at home?"</p>
<p>A-Mei nodded and stepped aside to let the fat man pass.</p>
<p>After a while, a tenant and a household came, and stopped upon hearing A-Mei's prevention.</p>
<p>"Grandpa Huang is not at home!" she said, and lowered her head to work.</p>
<p>"He'll be back in a moment, I'll sit here and wait for him," the farmer said cautiously and sat down.</p>
<p>"Why do you have to run here? There's nothing fun here," A-Mei said in a low voice? covering her face with her hands. The man seemed not to hear, and remained silent. Later, three companions came, and they sat down in the same way, and talked to each other.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Financial Support for Silver Tax Flourishes, Gold Market Steadily Rises by $2.20 <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>(Exchange Market Eases, But Foreign Dollar Ultimately Struggles to Maintain Position)</p>
<p>The gold market was quite stable yesterday, with major buyers showing considerable interest. At one point, it was bullish enough to break through the $20 mark. However, the exchange market was normal, with arbitrage providing supply and struggling to profit. Later, the domestic market remained firm, eventually retreating within the $20 range. The morning began with overseas silver markets showing a slight decline in England and stability in the United States. Forward silver prices rose in the near term but remained flat in the long term. Exchange rates declined slightly. Spot gold in London fell by half a penny, while American cotton rose by ten points, and American wheat showed negligible fluctuations. Reports indicated that the US House Ways and Means Committee had passed the silver bill proposed by the President, with Davis strongly supporting it, advocating a 50% tax on silver profits. However, there was also talk that the President had the power to collect silver to repay war debts. As a result, raw materials opened high, gradually rising from $14.50. After the opening, the situation stabilized. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, and the domestic market was quite stable. The market atmosphere was calm. Since the US had much higher spot silver prices than the government was willing to buy, people remained optimistic. When rumors of the Central Bank offering spot silver emerged, major players began to cover their short positions, stimulating the gold market and pushing it beyond the $20 mark. Buying interest surged, but the banks' domestic market was not very firm, fluctuating despite the rise. Later, banks continued to offer silver, and the exchange market remained loose, with arbitrageurs still providing supply. Public sentiment gradually weakened, making it difficult for the gold market to sustain its gains, eventually retreating back within the $20 range. The day's market conditions showed few special changes, with the situation mostly sideways. The price of pure gold was estimated at $1030. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at $1016.70, a slight decrease of one cent from last Saturday. Raw materials opened at $6.30. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 3.5 pence for British currency and $32.875 for American currency. Heng Yu Shun Li Yuan Chun Yu Qing Yong Yuan, Feng Yong and others offered strips. HSBC bought August US dollars at $1.875, rising from $6.30 to $7.50. Yong De Yuan Mao Yong Jin had mixed transactions. HSBC's listed prices for British and American currency remained unchanged. At this point, there was much sideways movement. Later, Tian Feng Yuan Mao Yong Jin bought, while Da Kang Yi Feng Yong sold, causing a decline to $6.10. Yu Qing Yong Lai bought, but Ying Feng Heng sold, resulting in more struggle. Hong Xing Heng Xing made small gains, rising to over $7. Da De Cheng Yong Feng Bing Xing Yi Feng Yong Zhao Feng Chang Ding Chang Da Xing Yong Shun Mao eagerly bought, breaking through the $20 mark. Shun Mao Yi Feng Yong Zheng Chang Heng Yu further increased to $1 and some cents. At this time, Da De Cheng Heng Tai sold off, causing a pullback. However, public sentiment turned bullish. Zheng Chang Yi Feng Yong Da Fa Yong Chang Sheng Yong Fu Yu Fu An Da Kang Hong Li Da Chang Xiang Heng Xing Heng Xing Yuan bought up to $24.70. Da Kang Yuan Mao Yong Yu Qing Yong Lai sold, causing a decrease to $2.70, likely because the banks' appetite was normal. Bing Xing Da Kang still covered their positions, raising it to $3.60. Ying Feng Heng substantially sold raw materials, eventually retreating to $2.60. The noon closing was $1012.90, with raw materials quoted at $2.60.</p>
<p>The afternoon opened at $1023.20, with raw materials opening at $3.20. HSBC sold June US dollars at $8.125. Yi Feng Yong Tong Tai Chang Yuan Mao Yong Fu An Qian Chang Xiang all sold, retreating to $1.30. Raw materials Da De Cheng Yuan Mao Yong Shun Mao bought, recovering $1. However, Ying Feng Heng repeatedly sold off. Da De Cheng Yuan Mao Yong Da Xing Yong sold off, dropping to $0.06. Yi Feng Yong Tong Yi Yu Qing Yong Lai bought, raising it to $2. However, the domestic market consistently stiffened. Sheng Da Da De Cheng Yuan Mao Yong Shen Yu Yong Feng and others eagerly sold, falling to $18.70. Da Chang Xiang bought in. The closing price was $1019, with raw materials quoted at $9.50. The day's highest price was $1024.70, and the lowest price was $1016.10, a difference of $8.60. The result was an increase of $2.20 compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on HSBC's listed US dollar price, which remained unchanged at $32.375, equivalent to a standard gold price of just under $1069. Based on the closing price, it was approximately $50 weak, a decrease of $2 compared to last week. The log price for June was $1024, and for July, $1023. The morning water supplement was $1024, and the afternoon water supplement was $1020. The price of pure gold was estimated at $1030. The spot market for refined gold was stable, with active trading. The formal transaction price added $14 to $13.50, sold by the Tianjin gang and bought by colleagues, totaling approximately 6,000 taels. The Central Bank reportedly offered 210 strips, priced at $1019. The swap market was quiet. As of today, 3,360 June strips remained, with a total of 11 long positions and 6 short positions.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was mediocre. Generally, Shun Li Wan Xing Fu Tai Heng Ying Feng Heng Heng Yu Sheng Da Zhao Feng Chang Hui Yuan Hui Heng Fu An Da De Cheng Da Fa Yong Yuan Chun and others were on the selling side. Da Chang Xiang Da Xing Yong Chang Sheng Yong Yuan Mao Yong Tian Feng Bing Xing Hong Xing Yu Qing Yong Heng Xing Yuan Heng Xing Yi Yu and others were on the buying side. Fu Yu Yong Feng Xiang He advanced first and then exited. Fu Xing Yong Da Kang exited first and then entered. The Dalian gang, Shun Li, did over 900 strips together, rolling out about 300. Wan Xing did just under 1,000 strips together, rolling out over 400. The Guangdong gang, Heng Xing, bought over 100 strips, selling several dozen. Sheng Da rolled out slightly. As of today, there were 30,142 chips for this July period, with a total of 49 long positions and 49 short positions. The total number of transactions for the day was 26,887 strips in the morning and 13,419 strips in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Although Chinese Merchants Support Exchange, the Exchange Market Remains Flat <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign news, London large strips, both near and far, contracted by 0.0625. US silver remained unchanged. Forward silver prices rose slightly. The pound against the dollar contracted by 0.025. The dollar against the pound fell by half a point. The pound against the franc fell by 3 points. The dollar against the franc fell by a small 0.025.

The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 3.5 pence for British currency and $32.875 for American currency. Compared to last Saturday, there was no increase or decrease in either British or American currency. After the opening, it remained flat. HSBC's listed prices were announced, with no increase or decrease in British or American currency. The situation remained flat. Later, major players covered their short positions, and Chinese merchants vigorously supported the exchange. The exchange market slightly tightened, but ultimately fell short of the standard gold price. Later, banks opened and immediately offered silver. The process remained normal, and the trend ultimately stiffened, likely because the expected decline in forward silver was not significant. The closing near-term selling prices were 1 shilling 3.5 pence for British currency and $31.875 for American currency. Compared to last Saturday, the result was still flat for both British and American currency. Chinese merchants supported the settlement quite bravely, collectively buying over 600,000 US dollars in the front and back markets. Banks were still eager to trade shillings.

<h3 id="e256">Weekly Initial Foreign Interbank Rate Slightly Firms <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Monday, the various transaction conditions in the market were comparatively slightly more vibrant. The foreign interbank rate was also one cent better than the previous day, with both the morning and afternoon markets at seven cents. However, since the rural areas went bankrupt and the finances concentrated in Shanghai, its expansion has not been slightly curbed, resulting in an abnormal morbidity where supply sometimes exceeds demand. Yesterday's head-drawing transactions were also white-drawn from beginning to end. This kind of market situation has now become commonplace, so the general public is not surprised. Interbank bill transactions, morning transfer and new transactions totaled more than 4.7 million, afternoon transactions totaled more than 300,000, and transactions in the small general association totaled more than 200,000. Due to the previous day being Sunday, the bank's collection and settlement included those that were supplemented yesterday, so it was slightly more smooth than usual. Foreign banks collected and settled bills of more than 3.1 million, telegraphic transfers of more than 500,000, various goods, remittance, pledge, and miscellaneous collections and settlements of more than 4.7 million, and withdrawals of 800,000.

<p>Small Retail Investors Collect Gradually</p>
<p>Gold Short Rises by as Much as Eight and a Half Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange only traded futures for the single month of June. The market unexpectedly became lively and firm, beyond the expectations of the general public. Major players had little entry or exit, and arbitrage was naturally still not possible. However, there were many buyers in the market. Although there were no major players making large purchases, sellers were definitely in the minority. Retail investors had very strong needs. The opening in the morning saw a sudden increase of three cents for 20 rolls, and the rest were uniformly one or two cents better. Among them, only numbers 34 and 43, etc., needed more, and the rest were collected by scattered retail investors. The second session continued to rise, with only 20 rolls slightly less than five cents. The trend was quite strong. The afternoon situation was still not weak. Gold short suddenly improved by another three and a half cents. Although numbers 20, 31, and 50 were sold, the number was small, and the supply still felt short of demand. The closing trend showed no signs of weakening, rising another one or two cents or so. The day was entirely upward, from two or three cents to five or six cents, with gold short alone rising by as much as eight and a half cents. Because the July futures had not yet entered the market, sellers were watching and the multiple parties were easy to manipulate, which may not have been the only reason. The total turnover was 8.24 million yuan. The rise and fall are compared in the table below.</p>

<p>The yarn market is showing a good sign because the raw cotton is trending up, causing the related yarn market to be firm. Some argue that recently, various routes have bought a lot of stock, reducing the bottom, and there is a slight shortage of new sales, while the price of Japanese yarn is still high, but the chips in the warehouse are still more than 30,000 packages, so the general shorts have no intention to compensate.</p>

<p>The opening of the forward yarn market was due to rising foreign cotton.</p>
<p>The market's sellers were not strong. Each month, each month rose 3, 4, and 5 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that 800-900 bales were sold in the spot yarn market. Japanese yarn rose by more than one yuan. Shorts compensated, and each month rose another 1, 2, and 3 cents. The total daily turnover was 14,550 bales.

The company's multi-head aspects are extremely high. However, yarn prices are still low, which is difficult for the factory.</p>

Speculation 多头 cleared up a large number. Japanese merchants also sold because there were many deliveries of Bai Luo Creek.

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the powder market in the morning, the market in each month generally showed a flat and tired appearance. The foreign wheat quote, Chicago 4 points big and 8 points small, Canada good 4 points, the difference is extremely small. As for the market situation, because of the silence of the Tianjin route and the sales market, it is even worse than before. Although Yingkou shipped a large number last week, the market has been reduced. As for the rest of the help, they are all scattered, although they are active, they cannot ask for more than supply, and in a blink of an eye, the new wheat is on the market, and the shaking of the market may not be avoided. Therefore, although the shorts in this month have been smoothly replenished, the market is still as flat and tired as usual. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the transactions in each month were lonely and not progressing. The buyers were also unusually sluggish.

As a result, this month is less than 5厘, June is unchanged, July and August are small 2厘 半, September is unchanged, and October is good 2厘 半.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the daily wheat market in the morning and afternoon, each month showed a fluctuating appearance. The foreign wheat quote was little changed in both places. Although the market's hearts are not very panic, but the new wheat harvest is in line, and the weather is like this, the future prospects are certainly better, and in addition, this year's northwest route is exceptionally good, and in the future, the northward migration of northern wheat may have to return to normal, so each price is In the mutual conflict, the final score is also small. As a result, July is small one point, August is unchanged, September is small one point, and spot wheat is still flat and tired. The market has a thick bottom, and new wheat is about to be in the market. Both goods and passengers are seeking to detach immediately, so it is necessary to prevent the price from falling later.

<p>(Shanghai South) The sources of each gang are still scarce, with only more than 20 numbers (more than 3,000 stones). However, the sales market is still able to move, and because there are still old goods remaining from the previous dynasty, the market situation, although it looks chestnut, is actually flat. The North 洋帮's total of the Qingjiao Songxi Lianfeng Jingnan Port and other thick late rice totaled about 3,000 packs. The prices did not see any rise or fall.

Yesterday, the guest 化 initially took a wait-and-see approach. Subsequently, the rice mill in this city, Xin Chang, etc., searched the market for more than 3,000 packs of Hanzhou, Sha市, Yuan Nan and other糙s at a low and suitable price for the guest糙, and the market atmosphere improved slightly. Rice shops and Rural villages in this city, as well as various help from Fujian and inland, have all asked questions, but the number is not large.

<p>As the summer season arrives, the sales of woolen fabrics continue to decline. However, the timely sale of summer fabrics is even more deficient than in other seasons. Besides the demand for suits, most people find woolen fabrics too thick and warm and are switching to silk clothing. White drill, white serge, palm beach, feather yarn, fancy pique, yellow diagonal linen cloth, etc., used for suits, sold extremely well yesterday. Eight or nine out of ten sales were made to tailors of Western-style clothing. Palm beach and second-grade white drill fabrics were the most popular. The Shanghai branches of foreign firms had only small orders from Jiangxi merchants.</p>

<p>The market for scrap iron has been sluggish recently due to poor sales. Although the surface price remains stable, the underlying market is very weak. For example, 2.6-foot-wide iron sheets are estimated at 9.5 yuan, and 3.6-foot-wide sheets are estimated at 8.85 yuan, a decline from previous prices. However, the enamel factories in this district were competing to purchase scrap iron in the past two days, leading to transactions of 600 to 700 dan. This is a welcome sight amidst the overall market downturn.</p>

<p>The market for second-grade white lead sheets has been very sluggish due to a lack of demand from military factories and tea merchants. Prices are extremely weak. However, there has been a recent shift towards activity after a period of quiet. Cigarette companies made transactions for over one hundred barrels, revitalizing the market.

The quality of this first batch of new tea is excellent, attracting the attention of both Chinese and foreign merchants who are actively discussing prices. The market is very lively. This morning, various tea houses issued samples of the new Keemun tea. Most merchants maintained a firm and conservative attitude during negotiations. However, in the afternoon, most of the English tea houses, including Tien Yu, Xie He, and Mian Lu, started purchasing. Jardine Matheson, with its large sales volume, also made aggressive purchases, strengthening market sentiment. As a result, the selling price of tea rose invisibly by 6-7 yuan to 10 yuan. According to unofficial reports, the highest market price has reached 240 yuan, indicating a very firm market.</p>
<h3 id="e278">High Cost of Mulberry Leaves Causes Many Silk Farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Lose Money <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>(Xiaoshan) The model silkworm area in the eastern part of the county achieved better results and higher cocoon prices. However, there were many silkworms but few leaves, causing the price of mulberry leaves to rise. Many farmers in the northwest township raised local breeds of silkworms, but the weather was unfavorable, resulting in significant losses. New cocoons have been on the market for several days. The cost of raising silkworms is already high. The highest price for improved breed cocoons is only 35 yuan, and local breed cocoons are 25 yuan, causing farmers to suffer losses.</p>
<p>(Chang'an) New cocoons in the town have been on the market for four or five days. This year's cocoon production is better with the improved breed, yielding a 60-70% harvest. Cocoon merchants have been open for business for several days. However, due to unified control, cocoon prices are low, and farmers' costs are high, resulting in losses. Farmers are preparing to produce native silk themselves. Cocoon merchants are reluctant to raise prices. Currently, the average price for improved breed cocoons is 32.3 yuan, and the price for local breed cocoons is 23.4 yuan. Each merchant has only collected a few dozen to over a hundred dan of cocoons in recent days.</p>
<p>(Huaiyin) The county's agricultural station sent staff to distribute improved breeds and encourage farmers to raise them. The silkworm rearing in the first, third, and fifth market areas is not weak, while the amount reared in the second and fourth market areas is lower. Many local breed silkworms were lost midway. The improved breed silkworm eggs developed smoothly. The early batches are experiencing vigorous leaf eating during the first sleep stage, while the later batches are also entering the first sleep stage. The latest batches have reached three sleep stages and require ample leaves. The supply of mulberry leaves cannot meet the demand, causing the price of leaves to rise. Each dan of leaves costs 1.5 to 1.6 yuan.</p>
<p>(Jiangsu) Recently, the Construction Department, in order to strictly enforce the unified control of the cocoon industry, fears that cocoon merchants in various regions will violate the unified control regulations. Therefore, it specifically issued a notice to the directors and deputy directors of various model and improved areas, specifically instructing all silver and money businesses not to allow any cocoon merchants who have not registered in accordance with the cocoon industry unified control measures and have not paid the guarantee deposit to open for business. Loans made in agreement with silver and money businesses should be rejected; otherwise, they should be reported immediately and penalized.</p>

<p>In overseas markets, Japanese silk merchants continue to aggressively sell new silk, and silk prices remain weak. Telegrams regarding new and old silk sent by local Shanghai silk merchants to Europe and America last week have not yet been forwarded this morning. The market sentiment is sluggish. Only Jardine Matheson and other factories imported 35 bales of dried second-grade silk yesterday, with prices remaining stable.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Silk Sales Show No Progress Last Week <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>Japanese merchants continue to aggressively sell new silk... silk prices remain difficult to increase.</p>
<p>European firms lower prices to purchase... Chinese merchants suffer losses and struggle to sell.</p>
<p>Last week, the local Shanghai foreign firm silk market showed no progress. European and American silk mills have significantly increased their consumption of raw silk and demand new and old silk. However, Japanese silk merchants continue to aggressively dump old silk, and new silk from Yokohama is entering the market. Japanese merchants are actively selling in overseas markets, making it difficult for both spot and futures silk prices to increase. The standard Japanese silk price in New York remains around $1.20 (US dollars) per pound. Japanese silk prices in England and France have fallen rather than risen, causing no improvement in Chinese silk exports.</p>
<p>Overseas telegrams indicate that silk prices in New York are only 530 yuan (spot for old factory silk), and new factory silk is only slightly above 500 yuan. Old silk in Lyon and England is only 570 to 580 yuan, and new silk is 540 to 550 yuan (both B grade). Various manufacturers believe that the losses are too great and are reluctant to sell. European and American firms continue to think about lowering prices and hoarding. Inland silk merchants have recently purchased over one thousand bales of white factory silk. Given the declining silk prices overseas, they are adopting a wait-and-see approach. Last week, only British and French firms replenished their inventories, resulting in a total transaction volume of two to three hundred bales of spot silk and an export volume of five hundred bales. The table below lists the prices of Chinese silk in overseas markets at the end of last week (New York price per pound, unit: US dollars; Lyon price per kilogram, unit: French francs).</p>

<h3 id="e281">The Queue-Keeping Society <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Cen Lou</p>
<p>A Shen Bao dispatch from Kaifeng the other day: a Queue-Keeping Society with long queues has been discovered in the area bordering Shijia Lian in Anyang, Yinlin County, Northern Henan. It is said that this is a reactionary group colluding with traitors and local hoodlums and has a bizarre slogan "good wine needs no bush". This is truly a "bizarre" piece of news.</p>
<p>Queue-keeping is undoubtedly a Manchu custom. When the Manchus entered the pass, there was a slogan at the time, which said "keep the queue, lose the head; keep the head, lose the queue". The so-called queue referred to the hairstyle prevalent during the Ming Dynasty, in which the hair was fluffy all around and not shaved. When the Manchus entered the pass, they wanted to shave the hair all around, leaving only the important part on top, which was braided into a queue. This was a Manchu hairstyle. The Manchus wanted to rule the "world" of the Ming Dynasty, and at the same time, they did not allow the existence of Ming Dynasty hairstyles, so the aforementioned slogan was born. By the time the Qing Dynasty was about to fall, the revolutionaries cut off their queues and shaved their heads into monk's heads, flat tops, or Western hairstyles. Thus, monk's heads, flat tops, or Western hairstyles all became symbols of rebellion. It is said that when Puyi cut off his queue a few years ago, some old officials cried for several days and nights. This shows how important the queue was to the rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>Although the Queue-Keeping Society in the area of Shijia Gou in Anyang County, Northern Henan, cannot be expanded into an organization that supports the rule of the Qing Dynasty, and the queue is no longer a symbol of the rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, even Puyi, the only descendant of the Manchus, has already cut off his queue. It can be seen that this organization is ultimately just a bizarre organization, and it will not have much practical effect. However, while the tangible queue-keeping may not have much practical effect, the intangible queue-keeping is controlling a large part of China's land.</p>
<p>The Japanese putting the puppet Puyi on the throne is very intentional, one aspect is to invade Mongolia to the west to deploy a defense line against the Soviets, and the other is to use this name to enter the customs, to "recover" this "lost land" of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. They are arranging things this way now, and they will launch it in this way in the future. It was once rumored that Puyi would enter the pass to worship the imperial tombs, and that was a signal. At that time, although we may not have the same kind of queue-keeping disputes as in the late Ming Dynasty, the slaves and subjects of Manchuria are fully qualified to do so. Whether or not to keep the queue is actually irrelevant to the overall situation. But Wu Sangui of the Republic of China era is now standing in front of us, and that is the most terrifying thing.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Sports Meet <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Ding</p>
<p>The sports meet has begun, as it is mandatory to hold one "according to regulations."</p>
<p>The atmosphere seems a bit tense. More than a thousand students in the whole school are all good men, and this is an opportunity to "make heroes out of the situation." Who wouldn't want to get a few "medals" and show off a bit?</p>
<p>Those few athletic stars who are "usually famous" have now been hired as inspectors and are restricted from participating, the reason being "to avoid monopolization and promote popularization." Therefore, the ambition of the students to try has been directly increased. Many friends who are usually unfamiliar with the sports field are also participating ambitiously, so much so that even an archetypal figure like Old Chen, a "Book-Worm," is said to have felt a little "uncontrollable" in his heart! Some people say, could it be that the Chinese nation is about to be revived?</p>
<p>In the center of a very large sports field stands a tiny "command platform," the arrangements are simple and the furnishings are shabby, which makes the heroes feel a little discouraged when they see it. A clerk said, "This is just a matter of doing things 'according to regulations'!"</p>
<p>After the tedious and vulgar opening ceremony was hastily concluded, the competition began. Although there were very few spectators, fortunately, they still accounted for about 30% of the school's total, which didn't make the venue too embarrassing. What is most commendable is that there are actually more than a dozen "misses" who have never set foot on a sports field in their lives, graciously</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>honoring it with their presence. It is rare for them to get up so early, covered in dust, and not be afraid of breaking their waists by stepping on coal cinder in their high heels!</p>
<p>100 meters, long jump, high hurdles, shot put, discus... One by one, the performances passed by blandly, and the spectators all seemed to lack energy. Strolling back and forth, they all vividly showed a bored face. Who came to appreciate art?</p>
<p>However, having said that, when the six unique female heroes perform, it is another matter. Before they even brushed their legs to run, they had already made the spectators panic. All they saw was people scrambling forward and backward, a chaotic scene!</p>
<p>When they threw the discus, everyone squeezed together like a small alleyway to get a clear view, so that the discus flew directly into the crowd twice. Although fortunately, a few more "martyrs" were not added to the school, there was still enough warning!</p>
<p>"Why does it always make people excited when women do things? What philosophy does it contain?" I don't know who said it in the crowd, but no one had the ability to answer this question.</p>
<p>Whenever the six female heroes finished performing a program, more than a dozen cameras would surround them and look at them carefully. Some people say that they are the real art appreciators!</p>
<p>"My goodness! The girls are really lucky! So many people have spent money to take pictures of them!" This is what Ah Er, the school's chauffeur, said. Everyone laughed. Unfortunately, during the triple jump, something very unusual happened: one of the athletes exerted himself too much, and with a "crack," he broke his shinbone! His face was pale, and he fell to the ground, able only to pant. In a moment of uproar in the whole venue, this unfortunate person was carried to the sanatorium, and the sports meet ended hastily.</p>
<p>That evening, when the students were eating, there was an extra topic of conversation out of thin air, but other than the "relatives and friends" of this unfortunate person, no one cared to "talk" about it!</p>
<h3 id="e283">Biography of Frustration (13) <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Forget Me</p>
<h3 id="e284">Pawn <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>The two of them dug into their pockets as much as they could, only managing to find more than a dozen copper coins. The sky outside had darkened completely, and their stomachs were rumbling with hunger. They couldn't think of any other ideas. So, I suggested to my friend that the only option was to pawn something, but neither of us had ever done it before, and the first attempt was bound to feel a bit awkward. My friend pushed me to go alone, and I pushed him to go alone. We pushed back and forth without settling on anything. "Hurry up! I'm starving to death. We don't have time for this." In the end, we went together.</p>
<p>However, the first obstacle arose. Because we lived in an apartment, taking a large item out at night would definitely be obvious to the concierge. Wouldn't that be a public embarrassment? After some discussion, we decided to sneak out, one person taking it first, followed by the other, avoiding people's attention.</p>
<p>Once on the street, each of us was carrying a package. Even we ourselves were bewildered. Our hearts kept pounding nervously. What was so shameful about it? Although that's what we told ourselves, whenever a passerby accidentally glanced at us, it felt as if our secret had been discovered, and we couldn't help but feel anxious. Sweat almost beaded on our foreheads, and our hearts beat even faster, our faces burning hot.</p>
<p>An unsettling feeling, like we had done something wrong, accompanied us as we walked down the bustling street, feeling deeply ashamed. We almost lost the courage to even look up at people, and just hurried forward with our heads down. We walked past several streets, and even past several shops of our potential client. We wanted to go in, but we didn't dare. Seeing the many people coming and going, the idea immediately stopped, as if someone had poured a bucket of ice water on our heads, and our whole bodies turned cold. Looking at the golden sign with the word "Pawn" on the wall, we both sighed heavily, cursed under our breath, and then despondently ran away. We didn't dare act in crowded places, nor on main streets. So, we had to go to quieter places. After loitering around for half a day, we still hadn't succeeded. The inner anxiety and the running around made our skin burn, and sweat flowed in waves, soaking our backs. At this point, we were also worried about accidentally running into someone we knew, which would be even worse. Our stomachs were growling and we were getting dizzy with hunger, making us feel extremely anxious.</p>
<p>After walking a bit further, we finally arrived at a place we thought we could go in. Our hearts were pounding frantically. We had to do it. We were afraid that those guys inside would become suspicious, thinking we were pickpockets who had stolen</p>
<p>things, which would be disastrous. So, we stood at the door for a moment, trying our best to calm down before finally summoning the courage to run inside.</p>
<p>When we came out, it was as if we had become different people. Our bodies were as light as swallows, and our spirits were high. Listening to the jingling sound of the silver coins in our pockets was like hearing the latest pop song broadcast on the radio. However, when we thought about how furtive and uncomfortable we had been earlier, we couldn't help but smile bitterly.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Decisiveness <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Perhaps because the nation is too large, most of our compatriots have a regrettable and hateful character flaw: procrastination, hesitation, timidity, and complacency. To put it bluntly, the decades of being bullied and carved up by various countries, as well as the infighting and disputes among our own people, are all disasters brought on by this character flaw.</p>
<p>In the past, this character flaw seemed to only affect middle-aged and older people.</p>
<p>But now, it has spread even more widely. Even the usually energetic youth have been infected, and everywhere one sees the moans of procrastination, hesitation, timidity, and complacency. There are no calls for courage, decisiveness, brilliance, and progress; only the muffled humming, not the joyous slogans.</p>
<p>People generally deceive themselves and others in this way, with talk of "maturity and prudence," "composure," and "consideration for the environment," using various methods to evade responsibility, causing this character flaw to progress daily and become more widespread annually.</p>
<p>This can only be said to be the source of weakness of the Chinese nation and the reason why the country never makes progress.</p>
<p>The times are advancing, and the world is changing rapidly. How can our compatriots, who are deeply afflicted with this character flaw, keep up? They are bound to suffer endless hardships.</p>
<p>I believe that the most pitiful people in this world are those who are indecisive and hesitant, those who wander aimlessly when faced with difficulties, those who do not know where to turn, those who have no principles of their own, cannot make decisions, and only listen to what others say. People who are indecisive and lack decisiveness can never gain the trust of others, nor can they build a progressive and brilliant life for themselves.</p>
<p>There are so many people who are simply indecisive in everything, fully displaying their character flaws of procrastination, hesitation, timidity, and complacency. They dare not make decisions about various matters because they do not know, do not have confidence, whether the result of the decision will be good or bad, auspicious or inauspicious. They fear that if they decide this way today, they may find that the decision was wrong and regret it later. These people, accustomed to hesitation, have completely lost confidence in themselves, so they always lack decisiveness when faced with events. Some people are very capable and have good character, but because of their habits of procrastination, hesitation, timidity, and complacency, their lives are wasted.</p>
<p>I believe that this habit, this character flaw of the Chinese people, should be urgently reversed, especially for our young people. We should strive to eliminate it and actively cultivate the spirit of courage, decisiveness, brilliance, and progress. Whenever there is an event before us that requires us to make a decision, we should decide promptly, and not leave it until tomorrow, or seek irresponsible opinions from others. We should practice making quick and firm decisions at all times. Regardless of the size of the matter, we should not hesitate in everyday life.</p>
<p>Of course, it cannot be said that everyone is without mistakes. But I believe that even if a person who is decisive and courageous makes mistakes, it does not matter. Because no matter how many times he makes mistakes, his progress in his career will always be more promising and useful than those who are timid and hesitant. A person who stands on this side of the river, considering and hesitating, will never be able to cross to the other shore.</p>
<p>Of course, before deciding on a certain event, we should see all aspects, we should consider carefully, and we should use all our reason to guide us before making a decision. But once a decision is made, it should be allowed to stand, to be final, and should not be reviewed or reconsidered.</p>
<p>This kind of decision has endless benefits for an individual. Not only does it build confidence in oneself, but it also gains the trust of others. Gradually developing into a lifelong habit, its stability is like the water at the bottom of the sea, unaffected by emotional fluctuations, nor easily swayed by the criticisms of others or the attacks of the outside world.</p>

<p>— Yuan Zhi</p>
<p>With a blast of southern wind carrying the heat of the tropics, I suddenly woke up from a dream and realized that spring was over and it was now the season of early summer.</p>
<p>Truly, in this metropolis devoid of the tangible shift of seasons, how would you know that it was early summer if the balmy wind didn’t tell you!</p>
<p>Early summer, just thinking of the phrase, a strange emptiness fills the heart, as if a wave of wistful emotion is washing over. And yet, it's also a time laced with ardent yearning and love.</p>
<p>Early summer makes me think of my hometown.</p>
<p>Early summer in my hometown is lovable. Scarlet pomegranate flowers are strewn across the verdant summer hills. Walking along a mountain path, wafts of the clean fragrance of grass and trees fill your nostrils. The scent immerses you, intoxicates you.</p>
<p>In the small, clear, rippling pond, the surface is covered with yellow flowers – the bright and lovely water chestnut blossoms. A few lively ducks are swimming in the pond, completely at ease.</p>
<p>The fields are vast, the green wheat shimmering with a light, pale yellow in the vibrant sunlight. Soybeans and peas are already laden with pods, beckoning you to pluck them.</p>
<p>Chirping swallows weave through the willow branches; mournful turtle doves cry out in plaintive tones.</p>
<p>Ah! The hometown of my memory in early summer is so</p>
<p>poetic and worthy of longing!</p>

<p>— Qing</p>
<p>A beggar who was begging along the street looked to be at least forty years old, but his body was particularly short, barely three feet tall. He walked with a limp, and if you didn't pay attention to his face, anyone would think he was a child. In this way, he became a monster in everyone's eyes. A group of people followed behind him, muttering and talking, wondering why he was in such a strange, unclassifiable state. The people following him just thought it was fun, like watching a two-headed freak at the Great World amusement park. He went to every shop, holding out his hand for copper coins. Normally, when they saw these people, they would either scold them or insult them. Even if they were lucky enough to drop a copper coin for the people they considered most repulsive, they would definitely make a nasty face. But for this deformed figure in front of them, perhaps because of his deformity, he aroused people's curiosity. They all gazed at him with a comical expression, looking him up and down.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>But the dwarf kept muttering and repeating his plea, holding out his hand for copper coins. He stood there for a long time. A person in the shop was about to throw out a copper coin, but another person stopped him, saying: "Wait, let's take another look." He was both admiring and making fun of him as much as he could. He seemed completely unaffected by the expressions and ridicule he received around him. In fact, these encounters were common everywhere, and he was used to it. His only hope was for the copper coins. Even if someone spat on his face, he couldn't do anything about it. Unfortunately, his parents gave birth to him as such an odd and unclassifiable creature, making him subject to ruthless mockery in addition to the cold reward people gave him. But sometimes, misfortune is exactly the lucky part. This dwarf was able to beg for some copper coins from almost every shop along the street. Because people were using him for a joke, they didn't care about a copper coin, but only about watching a moment longer, or making things difficult for him for a little while.</p>
<p>When their interest faded, they let him go, waddling along in a stumbling gait like a duck on land. The people making fun of him followed along as well, shouting and laughing loudly, clapping their hands, expressing their happiness.</p>
<p>Insults, teasing, and mockery were very common. These people did not need anyone's sympathy at all; they only sought to get the copper coins.</p>

<h3 id="e289">All Evictions, No Exceptions <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest city in the country. Generally, citizens are experiencing economic difficulties due to the impact of the January 28th Incident. We now have difficulty enjoying abundance and fulfillment in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and the high cost of rent, which is a difficult burden, fully demonstrates this. Therefore, it would be a wonderful thing if landlords could deeply understand the principles of the Rent Reduction Committee to save the economy of the citizens! However, those private interests who occupy a superior position not only ignore this, but also increase rents.</p>
<p>I am a tenant at No. 18, Lane 969, Zhonghua Road. I am now receiving a notice of eviction from lawyer Zhu Zhenlu on behalf of the landlord, Dunhetang. I have exhausted all plans, but I don't have the proper ability to uphold the contract. Therefore, I earnestly request you and the general public to make steady plans to help me solve my difficulties. I will first write out the lawyer's notice:</p>
<p>"Our building is dilapidated and beyond repair. To prevent danger, all tenants must move out by the end of May. No exceptions."</p>
<p>According to my investigation, the house I live in was built by the Hu Wenji Construction Factory (that's me) in the seventh year of the Republic of China. At that time, a warranty was issued, guaranteeing its solidity for twenty years. The construction cost was only over three hundred yuan, and after renting it to me, the monthly rent was ten yuan, which was later increased by 20%. During the January 28th Incident, the landlord defied the clear order of the municipal government and still has not complied with the rent reduction order. They also collect rent using the old lunar calendar, exploiting the tenants' economy, and it has been more than five years from the spring of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China to the present. The landlord absolutely refuses to allow tenants to offset the rent with the property tax they paid on behalf of the landlord, resulting in tenants paying over thirty yuan in property tax. According to the city's building regulations, if a building is dangerous, the Public Works Bureau will inspect it and notify the tenants to evacuate. Now, the lawyer claims that it cannot be repaired, which seems difficult to justify. A lawyer who has never studied construction techniques makes an arbitrary eviction, and their intention to expel tenants is clear. How great will our displacement and sacrifice be? Those who are unversed in the law know that they cannot fully resist such unreasonable infringement and oppression. Therefore, I earnestly request you to provide assistance by publishing this in the Amateur Mailbox column. Please help me and those who uphold justice to solve my difficulties, and I hope you will express your opinions on the rent reduction matter. Respectfully, Hu Gengsheng of Hu Wenji Construction Factory</p>
<p>Answer: According to your letter, the landlord is forcing you to move out without any reason. You can reasonably argue with the landlord. If the landlord does not agree, you can also file a lawsuit in court based on the contract, requesting performance. So your problem is not difficult to solve. As for the generally high rent, we should propose rent reduction, but this issue is quite important. Since you have raised it for discussion, let's talk about how to do it.</p>
<p>In this year of economic panic, the lives of ordinary citizens are extremely difficult, and the burden of rent is particularly heavy. Therefore, when they have no other choice, they try to tighten their living expenses as much as possible. Cutting back on clothing and food may only make personal life less fulfilling, but it does not cause much harm to the body. If housing standards are lowered, it will inevitably be detrimental to both personal and public health. Therefore, reducing rent not only allows ordinary citizens in economic difficulty to relax slightly, but the entire municipal administration and all citizens will benefit from it. However, the last rent reduction movement, although lively for a while, was initiated by only a few people, and the general public did not actively work for this matter, so this movement had no strength, and the result was limited success, which can be said to be a failure. Therefore, for the sake of the future of the city and for the sake of reducing the burden on the general public, the municipal authorities and all citizens must revive this movement. And to make this movement a success, all citizens must unite and jointly make demands on the landlords, and rent reduction can be realized. Otherwise, relying solely on government orders, the matter of "still not complying with the rent reduction order" like Mr. Hu's landlord is still feared to be unavoidable. In short, rent reduction is everyone's business, not a matter for one or two people. Mr. Hu has ironclad reasons such as his own warranty, so he can argue reasonably. If it were someone else, what else could they do besides complying with the eviction? Therefore, I hope that everyone will not ignore this issue and should pay considerable attention to it.

<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>"Shanghai doesn't look up to beautiful women admired by the manager of the World Trading Company!" The mysterious madam spoke in Shanghai dialect.</p>
<p>The handsome man in Shanghai was indeed clever. "You've won!" he said, hugging her tightly and kissing her passionately.</p>
<p>"You haven't failed either!" she said, laughing as she nestled in his warm embrace.</p>
<p>"Can you tell me your name?"</p>
<p>"MADAM X," she said frankly.</p>
<p>The next day, the day after today, the Shanghai morning after the Shanghai night, Mr. Wang Minsun, the manager of the World Trading Company, woke up from a sweet dream. His first act was to reach out his excellent fingers from the warm quilt to fix his Chaplin-esque hair. He seemed to sense that the beautiful Beiping madam had disappeared. No, now he should say, a woman who was a secret goddess of the city. His arm stretched across the pillow, and he barely opened his Kaulmen eyes. A wisp of lily fragrance left over from last night wafted into his Chevrolet nose. "MADAM X," he hummed softly, striking a hugging pose! Ah! Last night's dream, a sweet dream, a dream of a full moon and blooming flowers...</p>
<p>"MADAM X," he heard the sound of water splashing in the bathroom.</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>A strange idea grew in his heart. He quietly left the bed, slipped on his slippers, and stood up stealthily like a thief. A note with a few lines written on it caught Kaulmen's eye.</p>
<p>He stretched out his excellent fingers, took it from the table, and sat down on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang:</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I need a sum of money right now. The six thousand yuan check has been taken away, but you haven't failed. You don't need to seriously search for a MADAM X without a real name among the three million people. If it is unfortunately publicized in the newspapers, it may be detrimental to your position as the manager of the World Trading Company. Thank you. We may have a chance to meet again. MADAM X</p>
<p>Snatching the beige suit he had casually taken off last night, and the platinum-chained Omega slipped out of his small pocket, eleven o'clock sharp.</p>
<p>The gentleman completely lost his manners, and hurriedly left the bedroom in his undershirt and shorts. The long windows of the outside balcony were open, and the spring breeze was blowing the tasseled curtains, blowing the calendar on the wall:</p>
<p>March 31st, Saturday. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e291">Observations on the Current State of Chinese Cinema (Part 1) <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Qun</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese cinema has progressed, which is an undeniable fact. At the same time, Chinese audiences have also progressed rapidly, which is an even clearer fact. There is obviously a ratio between these two, that is, the latter is progressing faster than the former.</p>
<p>Isn't that right? Chinese audiences, especially those in the petty-bourgeois class, have strong demands on filmmakers. We can obtain evidence of this fact from many films. "Humanity" gained a wide audience, and "Raging Torrent," "Spring Silkworms," and "Little Toys" also gained a wide audience. In addition, the box-office success of "Twin Sisters" broke the world's box-office record. Going down the line, "Life," "The Wrath of the China Sea," "Salt Tide," and even "Pear Blossoms in a Rainstorm" and "Wind" all made audiences very excited. As for "City Night," "Morning in the Metropolis," or "Light of Motherhood," there is no need to mention them.</p>
<p>From these films, we can know what audiences demand from filmmakers and what their needs are. They demand that filmmakers reflect the reality of current society. When they are destroyed by the cruel reality of their past dreams, they hope to find a solution to their own depression in the movies. Because the above films have all proposed and solved some social problems to varying degrees, although there are individual misconceptions or intentional distortions about the analysis and solutions, each work has explored the ordinary and universal reality so that most audiences are not alienated from everything in the film. On the contrary, they have a close connection with their own lives and emotions.</p>
<p>Of course, it still needs to be repeated that the ability of "Humanity" or "City Night" to attract audiences has its own harmful elements, especially "Twin Sisters," which caters to the backward worldview of the petty-bourgeois class and has become a work that we should pay great attention to. However, this does not unequivocally prove that the audience has no ability to distinguish or is willing to receive the wrong instructions in the film. Objectively, on the one hand, the author explored topics that could excite them, and on the other hand, individual authors used strong means to rape the will of the audience.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't need to ask filmmakers to blame themselves from the bottom of their hearts here, but filmmakers with a new and correct worldview, due to the emphasis on spontaneous justice! They will not deliberately deceive the audience. Furthermore, in the near future, outdated writers will inevitably be abandoned by progressive audiences. Only the integration of their opinions is the most just judgment.</p>
<p>The above fully illustrates how enthusiastically Chinese film audiences demand filmmakers, and at the same time, they retain a strong judgment to monitor whether the filmmakers have fulfilled their responsibilities.</p>
<p>So, until now, how have filmmakers satisfied the demands of the audience? As mentioned earlier, in many films, those progressive writers have classily adopted the method of contrasting poverty and have seen the promising future of the oppressed class to some extent. This aspect should be the most significant achievement of Chinese cinema after the January 28th Incident, and it is also the minimum victory of the petty-bourgeois audience.</p>
<p>However, because the environment does not allow it and every day feels like a struggle, on the one hand, there are shameless and distorted film critics who use the "bright tail" as an excuse to sneer and ridicule, attempting to destroy this tendency in the cold laughter like a smokescreen. Coupled with soft film critics and those who oppose slogans beating the drums on the sidelines, some of the more fragile writers felt even more embarrassed. However, stubborn and firm writers will not be shaken by this. If they have accurately recognized reality, their works will inevitably receive the strong support of thousands of audiences, and therefore their existence will not be shaken by any evil forces.</p>
<p>There is a most important condition here, that is, the author must be loyal to the audience, as important as being loyal to art. Their works should not only be accepted by the audience, but also become a weapon of struggle. Therefore, it may be helpful to put forward a few points here as a decision on the current urgent task. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3 id="e292">Review of "Red Powder Iron Blood" <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Ding</p>
<p>The story depicts the sins of a warlord.</p>
<p>What deserves our praise here is the director's technique. He unfolded the plot of the whole play very tightly, and the connection between shots was so close and concise. For example:</p>
<p>(1) From the scene where Gao Yan molests Li Xuejuan in Lu Yuanfu's house, the close-up of his hand merges into the scene of Lin Zhenxiao's two feet stuffing into high leather boots. He prepares to go out at his own home. Because the key to the door was taken away by Xuejuan, he could not get his belt with weaponry, so he ran to Lu's house to find her, thus discovering Gao Yan's ambition.</p>
<p>(2) After Lin Zhenxiao discovers the evil plan of Lu Yuanfu and his wife, he destroys the furnishings in their house. The almost destroyed clock and the photos of the couple merge into the clock in Lin Zhenxiao's house and the photos of his couple, followed by the arrival of the crisis.</p>
<p>There are few other small techniques interspersed. Two climaxes, one is the scene where Gao Yan teases Lin's wife and Lin breaks into the door and discovers it. The other is when Gao Yan is about to insult Lin's wife and is killed by Lin, which is also arranged very appropriately.</p>
<p>But there are a few small places that we should discuss:</p>
<p>(1) Would the wife of a battalion commander, with such luxurious equipment in her home, actually cook for herself?</p>
<p>(2) Judging from Gao Yan's arrogant attitude and lawless behavior, giving him the title of a brigade commander seems too small. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to say that he is a military commander or a division commander?</p>
<p>(3) After Lin Zhenxiao was driven to the brigade commander, Lin's wife waited for her husband to return home for a long time, she must be very anxious and uneasy. This is a scene that can enhance the power of the play and easily move people. It should not be ignored. Why can't a single shot be found on the screen, completely forgetting it?</p>
<p>Among the actors, Fan Xuepeng has made significant progress compared to "Spring Dreams in the Dance Hall." After her husband was innocently arrested, the sad expression when they met in prison, and the helpless state of enduring his insults when she went to beg the warlord to save her husband, was so natural and touching! Wu Yuanlong's performance is experienced and profound, with his own unique insights. Tang Jie's evil warlord is not bad either, but Xiao Zhengzhong's crying face, who played Lu Yuanfu, was too exaggerated.</p>
<p>The photography is mediocre.</p>
<h3 id="e293">Writing Before the Performance of "Humiliation" <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ba Gao</p>
<p>Since "A New Life" was released in Shanghai, Soviet film products have added a powerful team to the camp of Chinese cinemas, although their products shipped to China are not many.</p>
<p>This "Humiliation" is the first Soviet production with sound dialogues. In order to occupy a place in foreign markets, the film, like German productions, is added with very brief English explanations.</p>
<p>The main theme of "Humiliation" is the success of a production and construction movement of steel factory workers in a group; a masterpiece after the initial implementation of the five-year plan. The original name of the film is "Shame" “Sbame”, but it became "Humiliation" when it came to China. The word "Humiliation" can also be established, because the evolution of the play is that the factory workers successfully planned a huge kilowatt wheel, and the result was tearing up the shame flag, and finally won the victory through unyielding efforts.</p>
<p>I am afraid that only the Soviet film authorities would be able to have such an understanding of using production and construction as the theme of the film! I think only the Soviet film authorities have a deeper understanding of the film being regarded as social mass education! They used films to greatly assist in the social mass education in the implementation of the government's five-year plan. In terms of the theme of the play, they believe that love is a part of individual life, and production and construction are the whole of mass life. For example, in "Humiliation," what they construct is: personal aspects in love get a happy family, and especially in construction, the production people, and the factory workers' group get the final achievement. The greatness and solemnity of consciousness cannot be compared with American films.</p>
<p>The oppression and bullying of the nation originally had a certain self-humiliating nature of corruption and insect breeding. This is naturally because the mass production and construction movement is ignored. Selfishness and self-interest violate the conditions of being a human being today, and the group's production and construction is towards the masses. I believe it cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>In terms of film art: "Humiliation" is also successful. The playwright's thoughts are very meticulous, and the structure can also unfold the solemn and great theme in the evolution of the play in a tortuous way, with tight and undulating peaks and waves. Like the playwright's thoughts, it has a meticulous organization. Montage is undoubtedly right. Regarding the actors, each has undergone a good training, so the performance is calm and natural, and it is hard to find among the famous stars in Hollywood. In short, the performance of the whole play makes the previous silent Soviet production "A New Life" unable to monopolize the front.</p>
<p>I think "Humiliation" is not produced under the conditions of entertainment. Its serious significance, in the education of social masses, will of course get the greatest efficiency. Film practitioners who pay attention to social mass education will not neglect this "Humiliation"!</p>

<p>Qin En walked past several sailors' meeting places, because he had to break off relations with women. He ran into obstacles everywhere. Later, he came to a coffee shop, which was a place for sailors to indulge in pleasure. After Qin En went in, he saw men and women hugging each other. How dare he open his mouth there? But things happened by chance. On this day, several sailors were jealous of each other, and as a result, they were secretly plotted against by a woman. They reported to the police, who came to arrest them. After they discovered this, they knew that they had been tricked by the woman. They were extremely resentful. Because it was inconvenient to stay on the shore, they were eager to go sailing. Qin En saw through their secret, knew that the time could not be lost, and went forward to contact them. Of course, it was a success with one word.</p>
<p>In addition to these desperate sailors, Qin En also found a cook - a black man, an engineer! A Spaniard, a builder!

March 11, 1931, passed the Gris Cape Lighthouse, day after day, year after year, their five-year period was almost full, but lust is the nature of life and can never be permanently cut off. At this time, except for Mike, everyone had long felt sexually hungry, often hallucinated, stood on the bow of the boat, and saw the beautiful shadows of women appearing on the water. Sleeping in bed, they had sweet dreams, and each of them was about to become a madman soon. They jumped and made trouble in the cabin, shouting and cursing. Mike ran up, wanting to stop them, but unexpectedly aroused their resentment. Everyone shouted together: "We have had enough of life on the boat! We want to go ashore!" "Then what about your contracts? What about the money you took?" Mike replied like this. "Money?" everyone said with crazy laughter, "We have money and nowhere to spend it, what do we want it for!" Mike knew that he could not reason with them and quietly left.</p>
<p>The next morning, Mike was standing on the bow of the boat when he suddenly saw a human body floating on the sea. He quickly sent the sailors to lower the lifeboat to rescue them, but it turned out to be a stunning beauty wearing a bathrobe, with snow-white skin and soft muscles. This water lily was seen by those men who had been longing for women day and night, how could they be indifferent? So one by one gathered around, laughing and making trouble. Mike really couldn't stand it anymore, and said to them: "Why are you all staring like this, haven't you ever seen a woman before?" At this time, the rescued woman was still unconscious, and he turned around and said to Qin En: "Quick, get a glass of brandy!" (To be continued)</p>
