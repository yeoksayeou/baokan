<h3 id="c25">謹貢獻於全國經濟委員會議　源 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>丨開發西北與政府借粉丨</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會。今方舉行首次全體會議於首都。叙全國朝野領袖。共謀建設事業之大計。甚盛事也。此屆主要議題中。有開發西北與减少棉麥借欵二項。皆於國計民生影響絕鉅。敢就吾人管見所及。略述開發西北與政府借粉之關係。以貢獻於委員諸君之前。按棉麥借欵合同。今雖有修改之說。但其修改内容係將美棉部分。自美金四千萬元减爲一千萬元。而麥粉部分則依然不變。記者於「政府麥之處置」一文中。（見本報一月十一日時評）</p>
<p>曾建議政府開發西北。以工代賑。以粉代現、藉以解决不得不借之麥粉。而助成西北開發之效。蓋以外麥雖爲吾國所需要。粉則國人可自造。政府如欲以高價之外粉。在國内變價。則必與國粉相爭銷。不獨政府將遭重大之損失。粉業亦受劇之打擊。是則建設猶未實現。而實業先自摧殘。當非借欵之本意也。退一步言。卽由廠商承銷。廠方固可免競爭之損失。而國産之新麥轉瞬上市。勢將無人問津。仍於吾農村有害而無益。關懷於農村復興者。自亦不認出此。故於其將借粉變價。再以現欵從事建設。曷若卽以借粉直接應用於建設事業之爲愈。卽以開發西北而論。工食問題。首待解决。若以借粉直接應用。則簡捷易行。但或有以運費過巨爲慮者。此點實最値得注意。</p>
<p>吾人試思一旦驅若干萬西北人民從事於大規模開發工作。其糧食之消費量。必甚巨大。究應如何供給之乎。開發工作。需工至多。以西北之貧瘠。就地徵食。或自附近購買。决不可能。欲求其不影響當地民食。自非由外輸入不可。可見運費一項。要爲開發西北所必有之支出。無論爲數若何之巨。籌劃若何之難。亦得勉力爲之也。吾人當視開發西北與剿滅赤匪。同其重要。苟以籌劃剿赤軍費之精神。籌劃運費。則難易殊不可以道里計。且按諸實際政府亦無立籌巨欵之必要。蓋海輪自美載外粉來華。可停泊浦口江干。所載之粉。卽卸轉津浦隴海兩路。直達潼關。此段運費可以記賬。不需現金。潼關以西。則可沿已築之公路或已成之河渠。用汽車民船或輕便鐵道。逐漸推進。此後運輸雖愈困難。費用雖愈昻貴。而借粉之價値亦愈增益。可斷言也。或引徵前年國民政府救濟水災委員會之經騐。以爲與共自滬運麥至開發工作地點而以麥給價。不若將麥在滬變價。以現欵給付工價爲經濟。不知水災會此舉實因沿江各省災後之一年卽遇豐收。當地糧價較賤。一也。以災工論。所得工價。如以麥粉計算。除消耗外。尙有餘剩。須就地售出後。始可購置什物。或稍事積蓄。多一轉折卽多一吃虧。二也。今開發西北工人。其處境旣與彼災工迴異。則其所受待遇。當亦有所不同。今日開發西北。當地鳩工。其意旣在寓賑於工。自以普遍爲主。開發之經費旣有限度。則工人之報酬。不得不與其人數爲反比例。固屬無可奈何之事。鄙見此次工人除由政府供給衣食住及醫藥外。應無甚私蓄可言。但在工作餘暇。政府應給以初等敎育與訓練。其工作在標凖以上者。加記分數。標凖以下者反之。及工作一二年後。乃計其成績。予以相當土地房屋種籽農具。組織集體農塲。使重歸於農。而安居樂。是故此項工人之工作單位與所需粉量之比例。當較水災會之災工爲小。而且西北交通不便。糧價實較他處爲高。水災會之經騐似不足引用於此也。</p>
<p>慨夫世界自不景氣以來。失業人數驟增。各國政府無不努力規劃。支出巨額經費。以謀救濟。在美國則有ＣＣＣ等機關。組織失業人民。開採森林以及進取其他公共事業。規模最爲偉大。返顧吾國。等救濟者雖衆。而赤焰猶張。吾政府努力剿赤。財政上最大　之支出。卽爲剿赤軍費。雖有救濟失業之心。而財力有所不勝。退就其次。不得不擇地方最貧瘠民生最痛苦天然富源最優厚國防關係最吃緊之西北。先行着手。今試向若許萬呻吟於人間地獄之西北同胞而昭告之曰。「政府欲開發西北。須用人力。爾輩若來築路濬河。及種種」</p>
<p>建設工作。可以供爾衣食。二年之後。給爾土地耕種。房屋居住。豐歳收成。歸爾自用。凶年歉荒。政府維持。」則我知必將歡聲雷動。而共慶來蘇矣。是故以工代賑。救濟無告。利用借粉。開發西北。實爲當今先務之急。願吾經濟委員會諸君子早完大計。</p>

<h3 id="c29">日本破壞條約 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>軍備競爭已不僅屬虛張聲勢、而爲一種直確之事實、此吾人所當慓慓危懼者也、軍備競爭開始於兩載以前、其事實則吾人之所耳聞目睹者、日本於一九三二年冬季侵佔滿洲、建立滿洲僞國、置於日本保護之下、日本此舉不僅破壞非戰公約、且摧毁華盛頓海軍條約之一主要礎石、蓋當一九二二年華盛頓會議時、因日本允許尊重中國領土完全、並不再侵略中國、美國乃亦允許限制美國海軍、至於不能在太平洋西半部作戰、藉以作交換條件、不圖十載以後、日本竟食言而肥、并立卽增加軍備、由是日本之野心已不復受條約之制限、其能限制日本野心者惟日本之物力及其軍備競爭之能力、此則甚明矣、</p>
<h3 id="c30">德之武力主義 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>就西歐而論、軍備競爭、乃因德國國家社會黨之革命而激成、希特勒秉政後、德國精神上之重整軍備可謂已臻完成、因此日内瓦方面關於物質的縮减軍備之一切討論、全屬敷衍門面而不切實際、蓋人人皆知國家社會黨所懷抱着爲武力主義、縱令軍縮會議一旦成立軍縮條約、亦不過等於外交上之具文、未足以取和平之實效也、</p>

<p>美國人民對於軍縮問題之實際率多誤解、英國人民亦然、英美人民最流行之論調均以爲、如各國同意縮減軍備、則各國間之爭執可不至嚴重化、而和平卽賴以成立云云、孰知本末倒置、未有如此說之甚者、一九二二年美國大造海軍、本可超越英國而上之、但因英國允許廢除英日同盟、因此美國亦約定與英國海軍處於平等、當時吾人所以與日本約定五·五·三·之海軍比率者、蓋以吾人深信軍縮爲達到和平之途徑、故美國寗願捨棄其海軍之優越地位也、</p>
<p>吾人所以允許海軍軍備與英國平等者、蓋因戰爭卽等於兩國之自殺、美國知之、英國亦知之、兩國旣相互有此諒解、則固不必從事於軍備之互爭短長矣、總之、美國之海軍政策、乃根據當時國際局勢之估量、而非根據一種簡單之觀念、以爲各國皆能裁軍、皆欲裁軍、以避免戰爭也</p>

<p>意奥匈經濟聯盟之動機</p>
<p>軍縮問題前途尚多荆棘</p>
<p>歐洲不安的空氣、震盪得歐洲的人、各懷戒心、恐怕一朝發生意餐、又會惹起一九一四年那様的大禍、固然我們還可以相信目上惡象雖多、可是還不致於立刻就發生戰爭、問題旣然多、並且異常嚴重、卽以法國而論、和平的巴黎、竟連續發生大革命以來所僅見的暴動、一般社會秩序、幾乎不能維持、其起因原於南部地方靠近西班牙的一個小城市的市價問題、至於牽動内閣和許多議員、這雖然是法國歷史上所見過的醜事、但由此足證歐洲社會的不安、特别是法蘭西比較穩定社會的暗黑面、和民衆對議會政治的不滿意、</p>
<p>在法國正忙於鎭定内部糾紛的同時期、奥大利政府與社會民主黨、也發生很激烈的巷戰、死傷的人竟在一千以上、而且維也納這所古城的巷戰、並不像巴黎市民那様祇是對内政不滿的抗議、祇是在暴露議會的醜態、牠還不止如此而已、牠包含得有很嚴重的國際問題、同時當然也有奥國自身的矛盾、國際問題是德·法·意·三國的三角對立、德國是想要合併奥大利、法國則祇在穩固牠在歐洲的霸權、意大利就另具一種想法、想乘德法的對立、另行樹立以意國爲中心的經濟同盟、以與德法對抗、</p>
<p>奥國六百七十三萬人中、有六百零五萬是德意志種的奥國人、在歐洲這種民族意識顯明、國家界限森嚴的霧園中、奥國又没有經濟的出路、堅持着條約神聖的法蘭西又不具與奥大利以經濟的援助、在一九三一年的時候、德外長寇提斯與奥外長蕭巴所訂的德奥關稅恊定、雖爲國聯所扼制、却總是德奥合併第一步所放的烟幕、一則法國執着凡爾賽和約與聖傑門條約爲武器、反對這件事、再則捷克與南斯拉夫等尤其懼怕德奥一旦合併、則少數民族問題必然更見紛爭得厲害、即意大利也怕牠南奇洛爾的二十五萬德意志人種、也受德國國社黨的煽動、引起嚴重的糾紛、所以黑衣宰相特派其外交次長斯維奇、到匈牙利的首都布逹白斯特去、拜訪貢巴斯、二月廿四日又從布達白斯特到維也納、拜訪鐵膽包身的陶爾菲斯首相、恊商如何結成意奥匈三國經濟聯盟的問題、據說意國除努力保障奥匈兩國獨立之外、還提示願將地里斯特和阜姆爲奥匈海上通路、不過以反對國社黨保持奥國獨立爲條件、當然保持奥國獨立有兩種意義、一個是對德不合併、再一個是遠離法蘭西、這當然是奥匈所祝禱的、原來奥國苦於社會主義者·國社黨·法西斯蒂·三者的競爭、竟至於不知如何是好、法國要顧忌到小恊約的關係、其實小恊約國現在對法也發生了多少不調和的地方、所以奥國不能求助於法、也無法去遷就德意志、於是祇好聽從意大利的領導了、</p>
<p>不過奥匈旣聽命於意大利以後、中歐政情、將更見複雜、德國·法國·小恊約國·意大利·波蘭·甚至於在某種地方和某種時間、還會牽入蘇聯、英國當然更不能置身事外了、</p>
<p>英國國璽尚書艾登在法國杜美格内閣組成後、特别來訪問、要恊商的重要問題、是要將已經成爲僵尸的軍縮會議復活起來、尤其想調解法德之間的對立、他曾與杜美格總理以下的閣員次第交換意見、使英法友好關係長久繼續、他於二月二十日訪德相希特勒、廿二日訪興登堡總統、也是爲軍縮問題而商談的、也祇說到怎様友好、怎様求軍縮意見的一致、但如何恊調法、則没有商定、艾氏二月廿四日又到羅馬去訪墨索里尼、當然英意之間更不會有什麽巨大的不同、樂觀的說話就越多了、艾氏將於明日從羅馬動身回巴黎、再與法當局交換意見、然後再說如何解决軍縮問題、</p>
<p>不過羅馬已形成另一重心、意奥匈三國經濟聯盟果眞成立的話、法國縱然能勉强保持其優勢的外交、但已和從前兩様了、奥匈與意聯成一團、小恊約國也祇好敷衍牠、於是乎法國的敵手增加、外交更不易辦、歐洲的震盪就越發厲害了、（一九三四年二月二十六日）</p>

<p>丨向經濟會議之報告丨</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會常委宋子文、頃發表關於美國棉麥惜欵經過及辦理情形報告書如下、「去歳四月間、子文奉命出席華盛頓經濟討論會之時、中央根據總理實業計畫、訓其相機接治國際投資、復於旅美途中、奉電指示原則及辦法、並授權相機辦理、子文祢承訓示、惟有謁其駑鈍、在不損主權有益於國家財政有利於建設事業範圍内、努力進行、以期不負使命、</p>
<p>抵華盛頓後、遂本此旨與美當局進行商量、惟美政府無直接借欵與他國政府之權、祇可由美國金融復興公司出面轉借、該公司依其組織之限制借欵於國外、只限於農産品、而農産品大批運至中國者、祇有棉麥、再根據我國海關報告、歷年美棉麥之輸入、爲數實鉅、</p>

<p>至銷售情形、據中央銀行美貸棉麥事務處經理席德懋等節略報告、一·麥欵六百萬美金、將次銷竣、麫粉則因市價關係、尚有困難、二·棉花因種種關係、本屆祇能銷售一千萬美金、故與美國修改合同如下、（原合同年年各報紙均已登載）（一）、美麥借額項下、美金六百萬元、其期限自本年三月一日、展至同年七月三十一日止、（二）美粉借額項下、美金四百萬元、其期限自本年三月一日、展至同年十二月三十一日止、（三）美棉借欵項下、自美金四千萬元减至美金一千萬元、至於美粉一項、金融復興公司、得有權取消、但須先行知照、惟美棉借額之减縮部份、曾經竭力商向金融復興公司、另行改購美麥或其他建設材料、該公司對於此項提議、並未接受、基於以上狀况、預計本年收入、大約美麥項下可得國幣一千六百萬元、美粉項下五百萬元、美棉項下二千二百五十萬元、凈收總數約四千三百五十萬元、可供建設之用、謹具報告、敬希公鑒、」　　附美貸棉麥事務處經理預計收入報告、「謹將美貸棉借欵現在收支狀况預計將來收入總額、分條報告於後、</p>

<p>美棉　美金一千萬元、</p>
<p>美麥　美金六百萬元、</p>
<p>美粉　美金四百萬元、</p>
<p>共計　美金二千萬元、</p>
<p>上項借額、如能使用完畢、除歸第一年本額外、總計收入全額約合國幣四千八百萬元、</p>

<p>除上列已售出棉麥貨價餘欵總數國幣二千三百五十萬元外、其餘未經購運美棉美麥美粉之收入、應作下列之預算、</p>
<p>一·美棉　截至本日止、共計已售出約五萬包、若以經過六個月銷售情形而論、餘剩美棉銷售、須約一年方可竣事、但因近來市面積存不豐、至本年夏間、或可有躉批售完之希望、</p>
<p>按照市價估計、銷售餘剩美棉收入、除現在業經收到之國幣七百五十萬元外、以現在匯票行市計算、約可得國幣一千五百萬元　　二·美麥　借欵全額、爲美金六百萬元、共可購美麥約三十二萬短噸、假定每担平均四元、每噸合六十元、則美麥三十二萬短噸收入、約爲一千九百萬元、内應減除運費約三百萬元外、則銷售美麥收入凈數、約爲國幣一千六百萬元、</p>
<p>三·美粉　截至本日止、共祇售出三百噸、其原因、一則係職處不欲以美粉在目前國内市塲、與國粉競售、一則因美國當局對於世界價格、亦不能贊同之故、惟如將來市面需要、價格合宜、自可儘量購售、則預計美粉一項、可餘國幣五百萬至一千萬元、依照上述計算、截至年終止、預計約可凈收美棉國幣二千二百五十萬元、美麥國幣一千六百萬元、美粉國幣五百萬至一千萬元、共計國幣約四千三百五十萬至四千八百五十萬元、職席德懋謹呈、二十三年三月二十四日、」</p>

<h3 id="c95">動盪中的日本政治（東京通信） <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>議會政治作用全失</p>
<p>軍人專制期待將來</p>
<p>齋藤内閣壽命推測</p>
<p>齋藤實拜命組閣以來、一連換了五個閣員、海軍·陸軍·外務·商工·教育·五部總長都換了人、幾乎半數的閣員去職、照常理推測、内閣斷無不倒之理、縱然說是非常時的恊力内閣、但閣員與閣員之間、閣員與内閣全機體之間、也不能如此没有連鎖關係、何况日本還掛着立憲政治的招牌、議會還是由財閥在後面操縱、換言之、卽政治還多少要受政治的影響、再則最近的鳩山一郎受賄問題、表面上算敷衍過去了、鳩山氏個人固不曾受賄、而政黨的醜惡、無論是政友會是民政黨、都一様的、暴露在民衆面前、議會政治的信譽眞是掃地無遺、同時敎育界各校受賄行賄、被法院檢舉的竟有二三十起、最近東京敎育局的視學課和社會敎育課課長、同被檢舉、前途還有擴大之勢、這豈止是日本政府當局一時的汚點、從這次的檢舉、暴露出日本敎育界的醜態、據說要作小學校校長、如果没有金錢的力量從中斡旋、那就無論你是怎様幹練、怎様有勞力的人、終是没有超昇的希望、祗可以老作敎員、决不能展其才能、所以日本的敎育界常常發生不祥事件、</p>
<p>農村經濟衰退的問題、表面也好像是有轉好的象微、而實際則物産堆積如山、非但一刻不易減少、並且還有增加的傾向、例如米價、照農林部的計算、每石米的生産費爲二十三圓三十四錢、而市塲價格不過二十二圓上下、還要扣除運費等項、由此可知農村生活、一時很難得有改善的希望、這又是日本政治不安、内閣動摇的原因之一、</p>
<p>新聞界的推測、總以爲齋藤内閣在本年夏初會倒台、理由是豫算案編成之後、牠的任務已了、再則一般人民都嫌牠毫無生氣、並且軍部也不必一定擁護牠、</p>
<p>不過在另一方面、還有延續的可能性、第一是在議院中、民政黨至少是凖政府黨、對現政府表示好感的、同時警戒着軍人的跋扈、恐怕齋藤下台之後、如果近衛文磨與平沼騏一郎二人之中、那一個上台、都會表現出更强力的軍人政治、則政黨必然遭殃、財閥也必然受限制、第二是政友會對齋藤之間情感雖漸見不佳、但目前還不至於怎様惡化、所以齋藤内閣大有延命的可能、第三是理由不充足當中的理由、卽是齋藤倒台以後、繼任人選的問題、現時頗不易打到恰當的人、政黨内閣不待言是没有實現的可能、少壯派軍人所擁護的人、又不爲元老所喜、財閥也反對、中立的超然派很難於尋出此齋藤强的人物、宇垣·高橋·清浦·都各有其弱點、</p>
<p>然則齋藤能安然渡過難關嗎、這又是問題了、現實的問題、就是前鐵道次長現貴族院議員青本周三氏、提出新設鐵道問題以迫三土忠造、由此很容易釀起貴族院彈劾政会的行爲、卽令現在貴族院還有讓齋藤内閣盡其職責的濃厚空氣、一旦發生枝節、再出一個閣員問題、則前途眞是難以豫卜了、再則國民同盟在衆議院裏面誠然是少數黨、力量也很有限、但是牠背後有軍部關係、與右傾各團體也發生因緣、所以牠的運動也未可輕視、牠以爲同一内閣竟有兩位閣員同時發生綱紀問題、這種責任不單某一個閣員的、而是内閣全體該負責、於是牠要提出不信任案、至少要盡量暴露現内閣的汚點、藉此造成貴族院的惡空氣、引動國民的反感、假使齋藤内閣在議會閉幕以後、對敎長補充的工作不能圓滿解决的話、則現内閣的壽命眞會難於延續了（三月九日）</p>

<p>自殺斃命之裘林、生前最初、乃一衣服推銷員、因其富有天才、最後忽從事油礦事業、雖數經失敗、但彼能憑其口才、仍行崛起、年前曾重行組織裘林煤油公司、最初資本不過三千萬、但彼藉宣傳方法、竟陸續增至一萬萬、詎結果則在美國西部開掘之油礦、竟毫無收獲、於是宣告倒閉、受累者凡達一萬五千餘人、於是控裘者累累、該處亞拉克花瑪法庭遂亦控裘以詐欺舞弊兩罪、予以逮捕、但旋以二萬五千美金交保釋出、裘遂乘此機會由亞拉克花瑪逃至温古華、由温古華來滬、當時美當局懸賞三千美金、加以通緝、但因裘自稱坎拿大人、受英保護、故至滬後、美領署雖擬加以引渡、但因英領署之反對而未能、</p>

<p>裘林最初來滬時、寓都城飯店、去年年底、遷入外灘匯中飯店、但二星期後、又遷卡德路某西人公寓、在該處時、所居臥室、乃與蘭維女士爲鄰、於是始相識、裘在滬上殊爲潦倒、但一度曾在大陸大樓上之某股票保證公司任總理之職、蘭維女士亦在該處任職、惟至本年二月初、裘忽辭職、蘭維女士旋亦離職、在自殺之前二日、裘忽遷居禮查飯店三百號房間、至蘭維女士、則於上星期六始卜居於偉達飯店、事前亦由裘所代定者、據謂蘭維方由漢臯來也、庸知入晚、乃發生此慘劇、</p>

<p>裘林之自希、外傳不一、或謂因美總統最近批准一重要法案、凡屬美方之逋逃客、如所居之處、爲美政府享有治外江權者、皆可引渡、因此裘在滬上將無立足地、於是自殺、又謂裘之營業失敗、事屬確實、來滬而後、携資不多、最近已殊窘急、二星期前曾一度自殺、被友發覺而未果、最近時露厭世之語、曾特自傳、謂人至末路、始知自殺者之心理、其欲自殺、蓋已不自今始也、至於蘭維女士之自殺、則個與裘林之感情作用也、</p>

<p>本案旣已由本埠英按察使署開始偵查、裘林屍體、自車送斐倫路騐屍所後、已由英檢察官毛毛理斯君前往檢騐、並開庭預審、當經展期至本星期四下午二時續審現本案之唯一有關係人、厥爲蘭維女士、英當局本擬加以詢問、但因蘭維女士身體尚未復原、故决暫緩、關於裘林之遺産、當局亦已開始調查、據調查結果、則毫無所有、故裘之自殺、與經濟問題、亦大有關係也、（華東社）</p>

<p>自從上次刊登了讀書消息後，在本週内便頓增了許多來函，許多已登記的讀者果然有送讀書計劃來館的，也有提出問題來與本部商討的。伅們都顯得很積極，可見這完全是出於自己的自動，不是被動的，勉强的。以前好久未與本部通訊的讀者，不過是因爲不知道我們研究的手續。現在旣然明瞭了，自不會再要我們來催促。我們很以這種現象爲滿足，并且還望其他仍未來信的諸君也一様地自動起來，不要把我們這裏作爲學校，要認這是我們自己的事，不容他人負責的；對於我們的工作有不滿意處，那是可以儘量批評，指摘的。我們的工全完建築在全體讀者身上，只有大家提出意見，始力邁進，我們工作才能進展。在我們方面，决不會因諸君的批評而「惱羞」，更不會因來信太多討厭，恰恰相反，我們只有愈加小心，愈有精神；我們怕的是大家冷淡，弄得我們無法可想。</p>
<p>此外，有許多讀者要我們加大篇幅，我們與讀者是一様的希望，不過，這有兩個條件：一是要材料豐富，我確有値得向讀者報告的成績；二是與本報其他各欄的篇幅，没有什麽影響。這一方面要靠諸君的工作，多給我們材料，一方面自當由本部去極力設法。</p>
<h3 id="c209">本週情報 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>本週應向諸君報告的是：</p>
<p>（一）本週我們又增加了十五位讀書同志。丨丨卽參加本部研究者。</p>
<p>（二）要求與本部面談的，非常踴躍，他們打電話來問，眞是非常懇切。我們規定的談話時間是每星期日下午二丨丨五時，有特殊事例外，但要談話，必要提出書面要求，經本部同意後，然後由本部函約，一定要經過這種手續。</p>
<p>（三）本週來了三封信，都是希望我們能討論，研究實際問題的，當然爲了解實際生活而讀書是我們與讀者同様希望的，所以我們便刊登了一篇「怎様研究東北問題」，以後亦擬多談，祗要諸君能提出問題與我們。</p>
<p>（四）因爲諸君的努力，加增了我們的工作，所以我們除增加辦事人外，并把工作時間延長二點鐘。</p>
<p>（五）參加本埠研究者原暫以本館讀者爲限，丨丨因爲當爲我們深恐把塲面拉得太大，結果反而一事無成，現在外埠本報讀者，常來信請求參加，情詞懇摯，使我們實在不忍拒絕，所以現在本决定請他們加入。</p>
<h3 id="c210">預告 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>諸君常來信要求我們出版讀書問答的合訂本，現在已着手編印了。預計在今年四月十五日以前總可出版，字數約八萬至十萬字。價尚未定，但法不超過成本費多少。</p>
<h3 id="c211">新書介紹 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>最近我們買到了一本經濟學講話（陳貌隱著，北平好望書店出版）本部覺得這書還値得介紹與諸君作爲入門讀物。因爲它：</p>
<p>（一）是講述體裁，文體淺近。合中國人口味。</p>
<p>（二）不拘於資本論之叙述次序，把資本論以後經濟學的發展一并加入，使讀者獲得經濟學全部的概念。</p>
<p>（三）除將正確的解釋叙述外，附帶的還把各種謬說批判，這是本書的特色。一般迷戀著流俗經濟學，或雖知其謬而不知其所以謬的人，均應一讀此書。（不過，這書是否完全無瑕，尚未能卽下斷語，不久本部當再有詳細批評，並望讀者讀後也能提出意見來）</p>
<h3 id="c212">致謝 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>本部爲了實際問題討論材料，供給讀者，前曾老着臉，向各著名雜誌社，函請贈送，現在蒙它們賞臉，寄來不少書報了。本部除於本館收到贈閱書報致謝中一併附入外，特在此地作一總的致謝；并望各大報雜誌仍源源惠贈。</p>

<h3 id="c247">說姓氏　郁達夫 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>姓氏的起源，當然是和人類一様的古。白虎通上說；「古者聖人吹律以定姓；………姓有百者何？………正聲有五，宫商角徵羽，轉而相雜，五五二十五，轉生四時，異氣殊音悉備，故姓有百也。………所以有氏者何？所以貴功德，賤伎力，或氏其官，或氏其事。」通志上說；「三代之前，姓氏分而爲二，男子稱氏，婦人稱姓。氏所以别貴賤，故貴者有氏，賤者有名無氏。姓所以别婚姻，故有同姓異姓庶姓之别。至三代之後，姓氏合而爲一。於文，女生爲姓，故姓之賜，多從女，姬姜嬴姒姚嬀姞妘婤㚰嫪之類是也。」從這些地方看來，姓原是最古，是女性中心的家族制度開始的時候就有了；進而有氏，是社會上有貴賤之分的時候起始的，後來再進，姓氏便合而爲一了。</p>
<p>古代人齒稀少，所以姓只百而已。其後生齒日繁，交通日廣，唐宋以後，遂有千姓以上的支别。我們小時候在私熟裏讀的百家姓，以趙氏起頭，大家都說她是宋初的東西，因爲當時南唐未滅，吳越王割據南方，勢正强盛，妃孫氏，故而百家姓之首，就是趙錢孫李的四族。其實通行本的百家姓，删繁就簡，主意只在取便閱讀而已，若以當時的姓氏來說，是决不至只有百家的。</p>
<p>古代姓氏的來源，旣係如此，則姓氏的在封建社會，家族制度上的重要，自然是可以不必說了。現在當我們正欲打破封建社會革除家族制度的時候，對這姓氏的存廢，當然是一個很可研究的大問題，五四時代，曾有人創議過廢姓；朋友中間的有幾位學科學的人，曾說廢姓之後，可以以號嗎來代替姓名，譬如病院裏的患者，，上海巡捕房的巡捕，單以第幾號第幾號來代替姓名，也没有什麽不便。北平的玄同敎授，也曾實行過這主張，作家中間，更有一位呌作廢名的先生。</p>
<p>近來因爲看見何徐兩位的創作發表問題，閙得很兇，替他們辯護的人，曾說到過姓名尙且要廢，這一點事，又何必嘵嘵。所以就寫下了這一段雜感。</p>
<h3 id="c248">野人之家　劉明 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>秋天一早上，同着兩個山谷中長大的孩子，登上山頂，去訪野人之家。</p>
<p>野人都是高興住在山頂上那些清凉的地方的。山脚下的谷或是狹小的原野，因爲有着多量的濕熱和瘴氣，便讓給另外的民族住着。雲南人呌他們做山頭，原不是没有意義的。</p>
<p>房屋很矮小，茅簷的兩翼，垂在地上，遊牧民族所住的帳篷那様的形式，在這兒却還遺留着。門口掛着水牛頭的骨骼，有的一個，有的三四個，據說是用來避邪的。</p>
<p>走進了這種掛着水牛頭顱的門，便在一個熟識的野人家中，像客人一般地坐在地板上了。所謂地板，只是一根一根的茅竹舗成的。下面時時起着雞羣拍翅以及小猪嚎呌的聲音；一種牲畜的難聞氣味。亦常從竹子縫隙處透了上來。主人很老的了，却還健康，因爲常到山下賣柴便漸次和我們成了相識的。他乎抖抖地把一個細刻花紋的銀盒子，放在我的面前，呌我嚼一點放在裏面的檳榔和石灰。我不會嚼檳榔，只是把銀盒子取來觀玩，因爲在這様粗陋的茅屋中，而有這様精緻的東西，是不能不使人感到詫異的。老人大約也很寳貴這個東西吧，話一開始，便對我很有興味地講起牠的來歷了。野人話，我只懂得一點，經他比着手勢，和兩個孩子的翻譯，才知道這銀盒子是一個白人送給他的。因他在年青的時候，終日跟着山塞的頭目，做着服侍的事情。當時曾有白人來山遊玩，送頭目好些東西，因此他也得了一份，便是現在視爲寳物的銀盒子。後來翻看滇緬劃界條文，見這個呌做「戶董」的野人山塞，在清末都還是屬於中國的。以老人的年齡看來，可知此地在未劃入緬甸以前，白人就和他們很親密地往還着了。</p>
<p>屋裏光線很暗淡，久坐一陣，才望見一隻角落裏還掛有像片。一張是青年軍人的雄姿，背有來福槍之外，腰閒還掛有一把長刀。據老人說這是他的大兒子，現駐在很遠的地方，細查上面寫的英文，始明白那是從米索波大米亞王國寄回來的。另一張也是一個青年的攝影，只是眉宇缺少了英爽之氣，而且也没有了武裝，老人說這是跟隨洋官的二兒子，大約便是西崽之類吧。</p>
<p>山塞裏有木造的二層洋房，學校敎堂和郵局通通設在裏面。在廊下，門間，窗口，修女的白大帽，和胖臉敎士的絡腮長鬍，常是一閃地出現。孩子們高聲誦讀或是唱歌的聲音，則從籬落間流溢出來。不知怎的。一出了老人之家，看見了這個學校，便覺得未來的Sol-dier和Servant是正在大量地製造着哩。</p>
<p>下山時，老人送我們幾個龐大的牛肚子果，在路上吃了半個，其餘的因爲越拿越重，便投在深谷裏了。</p>

<p>我偷看一下他那用頑强去抵受永遠的痛苦的面孔，覺和有點快意，於是敏捷地鞭着牛背，牽着繩走開，在草坪底南角徘徊，故意朗聲叱嚴我跨着的黑色動物。牛糞和草香的氣味，隨着晚風拂着人們底鼻孔。他在後頭捉不住我底意思似地。用忍耐的語音唱着笨拙的挑逗的歌調。牛吃飽了，習慣地向家裏走。當將要離開草坪的時候我擰轉頭對他說：「你看見月兒從東邊探出頭來了，就到風雨亭旁邊好不好？」歡快的歌聲的確地在我腦後揚了起來。</p>
<p>晚飯後姊姊壓抑着笑容對我說：「剛才黃副官帶來你姊丈的音信，呌我們兩個趁便明天早上跟他一道兒上省城。好，我們趕快把東西預備一下吧。」</p>
<p>「噯，不是說過幾天麽？……那，後天去不可以麽？」我蠢拙地講出我那没用的要求。她像懂得了什麽似地對我摇頭，狡猾地笑了一笑。</p>
<p>銀様的月色，射進客廳來，傾瀉在忙着包紥束西的人們底身上。山頭不絕地傳出青年男女底抑鬱而粗壯的調情的山歌，這種像被壓在海底好久的怪物底呐喊似的聲音，不平常地刺着我底耳朶，我就要毁滅在焦急和咒咀中間了！等到空閒下來，悄悄地跑出去的時候，人家都閉上了門了。大概因爲山歌完全沉寂了的原故，月兒特别顯得凄清。我走進風雨亭，舒適地透了口氣，眼眼恣意地在這孤寂的山頭尋覓。賴家莊透出那等太陽起來才熄滅的燈光，討厭地在月亮下閃着，像幻影似地，隱約現出那打稻塲中有許多忙着工作的粗壯的姿影，那擊稻稈的聲音，繁密地一下子刺着我底神經，又驕誇地謡撼着整個村落。</p>
<p>我在風雨亭週圍徘徊着，冷冷地露水透過那薄薄的衣服，觸着我底皮膚，像給我一個兇惡的預兆。我握了拳頭，仰着腦袋仔細地把就要入睡的高大的獅子崗望一遍，慢慢踱回屋子裏。</p>
<p>爲了農忙，爲了要跟賴老虎澈夜不眠地打穀，這賴家莊的莊丁阿隸和我就永遠不能重逢了。</p>

<p>（二）風和土</p>
<p>排山倒海一般，灑粉似地捲在空中，辑天都變成了灰黃丨這是北平的咒詛丨風和土。其實北平的風勢雖大，却遠不如上海去年的颶風，不過北平人談起「刮風」二字正像上海人談起「加房錢」一般地有切膚之痛。這大約是因爲「土」的緣故；風的土發生了妥恊關係，聲勢確乎是浩大，非尋常可比了。</p>
<p>刮風的時候，人們便在屋内也能聽見呼呼的風聲，震得門窗發響。雖我磁平的房子都是嚴密地糊着紙，也免不了風和土的侵入。几案雜物上不到一會兒就單上了一層黃黑色的細灰土，甚至於抽屜裏也有，這眞可以說是「無孔不入」了！</p>
<p>一出大門更不用說了。風助土勢，土借風威，黃漫漫地佔了整個的空間。女人們有用薄紗遮臉的，男人們有戴遮風眼鏡或用手帕掩住口鼻的，但到底還不濟事。只有坐洋車，四圍有棉篷蓋得密密地，才可以避免風和土的製擊。不過洋車夫却顀舊拉得車丨雖然比平常慢些丨據有些人說，他們是生就拉洋車的胚子，所以纔有這駱駝式的本能！</p>
<p>然而坐在棉篷的洋車裏也只免了劈頭劈臉的風和土；隂森森刺骨的冷氣依舊在棉篷的隙縫裏透進來，把舌頭在唇邊舐一下就覺得毛沙沙的粘着一圈塵土。從車簾的一小塊玻璃向前看時，洋車夫好像騰雲一般在風塵中跑。拉到了目的地，跳出車來向他臉上看看，你一定疑心他不是剛才的車夫！一臉烏黑的像煤炭店伙計一様，只露着烏溜溜一雙眼，白巉巉兩排牙齒！</p>
<p>刮風時最好自然是「閉門家裏坐」，若必須出門時，坐洋車還不能完全擋風避土。最好是坐汽車，把車門關緊，曳一條狐皮車毯往腿上一裹，憑牠風狂土大，也奈何不得了！</p>
<p>非但如此，便在不刮風的時候，坐了汽車飛也似的在街上疾馳，捲起一陣風，揚起半街土，也是十足的威風。這種威風是上海的汽車所没有的。</p>

<p>歸莊（玄恭）「尋花日記」，爲古日記文學中之妙品，「小石山房叢書」曾收刊其全稿（初期刊本，所收並不完備），明遺民的生活，於其尋花的過程中可以見之。月前，獲得其在癸未年與翁季霖一書云：「弟以五月出，留滯江北，至九月歸，崑山之人，見者皆驚，蓋傳其死久矣。按五行志，凡訛言皆屬災異。如訛言黃龍兒，訛言大水至，皆記之於史。今歳地震水溢，此災異之見於天地者也。江南民訛言歸生死，此災異之見於人事者也。不知今日史官，亦當並書之否？一笑。弟嘗謂洞庭橙橘，虞山楓茶，海濱菊花，皆屬聖觀，而並在一時地，非同路勢難兼得。至秋冬之交，當艤一小舟於河干，任風吹之，至東則東西則西。連日西風緊，將吹到東海之濱菊花叢中矣。山中丹苞朱實，知已爛然，惜哉今歳無緣，惟當夢遊耳。」不僅一様的看到歸莊一班人的生活况，無可奈何，不得已的悲憤心情，也是「尋花日記」的一個好參考資料，因亟錄之。</p>

<p>「還没有。他們很忙，你知道，他們所有的不只是這一件事。我去了幾次說没有說清楚。誰以爲他們只有這一件事來？不是說何仲華的事情只一天就弄妥了嗎？可是她雖然在這様想，却没有說出。</p>
<p>「回頭我再去問一問，」卓雲預備結束這一次談話似地說。</p>
<p>「費心。丨錢要到什麽時候才可拿？下星期一我來拿可不不以？」</p>
<p>「說好了就可以拿的。」</p>
<p>「我意思想我星期一先來拿發表費。」</p>
<p>「那怕還拿不到。好在日子還早，今天還只二十：在概是不會隔得很久的，」卓雲寛解着。</p>
<p>依娜所說的想在那天去拿發表費的星期一是她的弟弟和妹妹的開學的日子。要去讀書，是該先把學費待付清的，因此她很想能在那天拿到錢。可是她清楚地看到那是無望了，因爲要是她再那様說下去，也許會使席卓雲覺得她太不知趣，而會說出付錢的權並不在他，他也得去商量起來之類的話來的。因此她不再要求，就在得到了他的「一講妥，就通知你」的許可之後，離開了她的辦公室。</p>
<p>「這次小吉與小安也要受到影響了！」她在路上一邊在遲鈍地走，一邊在昏沉地想。「只好藉口過年，要他們遲幾天入學了。咳，過年！對咧，學校爲什麽要在年前開學？他們不是也爲了要收那學費去對付年關的一切？這年關，這様地難過，不會有人竟留在這邊，過不過去？要是席卓雲丨」</p>
<p>想到了那里，她的心急跳着，因爲她知過，要是席卓雲所答應她的那筆錢成了問題，她就會是那過不去的人們中的一個。</p>
<p>在那不安定的狀態中，依娜只在上午期待下午，今天期待明天地期待她能早點得到那欵項。她那様不安定地過着，直到二十三日的傍晚，她才收到她在那様急切地期待着的席卓雲給她的信。他在那信中說，賣稿事出版方面已答應，可是只肯每千字在發表費以外加出二元（在她的去信中，她照他的提議，要求每千字加出四元）。末了，他勸她還是那様同意了好。</p>
<p>「還有什麽不同意的呢？」那虛懸了幾天，到現在才有了着落的心在笑着。</p>

<p>棉市略平定、因美棉趨漲、且本月份爲最後一日、上午開盤市氣尚平、午後市上傳說交貨籌碼尚缺、市價又見高翔、三盤漲起三四角、爲四十二元四角、詎料收盤有一部份多頭無意收貨而放出、突然狂跌六角半、結果爲四一元七角半、較上月最後價跌去一元二角、現棉消費呆滯、以紗銷不暢、廠胃停頓、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份均呈平疲之象、洋麥報價、芝加歌好一二角左右、坎拿大好八分零、當開價時、市氣尙見平定、旋以實銷毫無動靜、一部分之投機、在此環境之下、已不敢再擯、各盤中陸續回出、市面遂呈不振矣、迨至下午開盤、近遠期形勢、仍不見佳、因廠家雖未放出新籌碼、但國内全部之購買力、實覺衰落異常、並傳天津粉廠、以四鄉麥子到湧、已可開足全車、申廠則多數减開、由此情形、似乎申粉之需要、又受一種阻力也、結果本月份較前週小一分二厘半、四月份上一分半、五月份小二分、六月份小一分七厘半、七月份小一分厘半、八月份小二分、</p>

<p>丨厚粳及各花色俱各平定丨</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源到各帮船頭四十餘號、（計貨六千餘石）市况因天雨濛濛、人心稍定、故常帮蘇同南港等粳、開價悉守老盤、杜洋尖及隂變元亦屬平平、而各帮晚稻、客帮包胃尙有南洋帮採意轉淡、且選擇又近中次、而北洋帮則反是、納胃較强、剔揀多從高料、市面乃呈提高削低之勢、結果統計南北洋兩帮共進青角松泗西練晚稻二千三四百包、其價高貨卽提四五分、中次貨下貶二三分、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各貨到期念二三號、市上各種銷胃甚呆、市形白粳價續小三五分、羊杜埠客尖早薄稻白元隂元價形勢仍屬平疲、</p>

<p>昨日客秈市况、因存底充實、來源不絕、市面初居續疲之象、一部份貨主亦亟亟求脫、自願貶價早售、故各米討價續小三四分、市價小後本客均有問津、温甬兩帮繼續試辦各路糙秈、本街與福州亦稍問津、交易雖不見旺、但已形活絡、如今次所辦能得合劃客客消化、則今後當有繼續去化也、但市上存底充實、來源不絕、途貨尙未到齊、故欲望市價十分高昻、亦殊不易、昨全市由本街去陳機秈九百包、價六元一角至六元零三分、寗波去京柳糙一百六十包、價六元零五分、滁州糙秈九十四包、價五元六角半、温州去皂市糙秈二百包、價同上、福州去砶靖一百六十包、價六元四角云、</p>

<h3 id="c293">官 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 秋</p>
<p>我常聽得人家說：「中國的國民性，就是官。」爲什麽呢？因爲一個人生了下來，便和官發生關係，誰家添子，誰家得孫，都稱阿官，或稱官官；便是他的父母家長，也得替他取個乳名，老大便呌大官，老二便呌二官，或是五行缺金的，呌他金官；生肖屬虎的，呌他虎官；其他福官，壽官，春官，秋官，乾官，坤官……等，不可勝舉，總之無不喜官，官眞受人歡迎咧！</p>
<p>至於家庭之間，維一的希望，便是兒孫做官，可以顯揚門庭，榮宗耀祖。社會之上，極度的艷羨，也無非要想做官，可以買田得地，弄權示威。所以親友頌禱，不外升官發財；鄉里崇拜，只見做官上任。</p>
<p>在從前，軍閥時代，一般人求官不得，形諸官夢；戀官患失，變成官迷；上則賣官鬻爵，下便靠官托勢。要知做官也非易事，所謂「朝内無人莫做官」，有了靠山，阿貓阿狗，都可做得，並且任性所爲，毫無顧忌，所謂「只有州官放火，不許百姓點燈。」儘可官氣十足，官話連篇，民間之事，置之不問，便說「清官難斷家務事。」同僚之間，定須帮忙，切守「官官相護」之訓。倘然你來頭不大，便須把結上司，否則包你有「新官上任。」把你「舊官請出。」官塲原同戯塲，上臺誰無下臺？間有一二比較廉明些的，便得號稱好官，比之萬家生佛，口碑載道的了。</p>
<p>講到做官，本當清正廉明，要能恪守官箴，纔配做官，實在因為平時所見的官，貪官，昏官，瘟官，糊塗官，太多了，所以好官，益發見得難能可貴了。</p>
<p>官有官味，官有官癮，要嘗官味，就得鑽天打洞去謀；要過官癮，必須吹牛拍馬去幹；所以律師不做，要做法官；醫生不做，要做醫官；警察要做警官，兵士要做軍官，其他銀行有監理官，郵政有郵務官，連那侍衛也有侍衛官，書記也有書記官，士農工商兵警，無不有官，雖最小的官，所謂「芝蔴菉豆官，」也須官他一官，以爲快。待到一官到手，管他學問資格，才具見識，只要官運亨通，憑你「瞎纒三官經，」也會官聲四布，官階直上；因此人人都想做官了。</p>
<h3 id="c294">最近的文藝趨向 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 釋雲</p>
<p>在最近文藝的方向，已很快的轉變到民族文學方面。本來，文藝的方向，是跟着時代的轉輪推進的，不合時代的文藝，無不歸於淘汰。</p>
<p>過去我們見到的許多文藝創作，大半是頽廢，淫蕩，浪漫，和含有煽動階級門爭意味的普羅文藝一類東西，這種毒液，流到社會上，也曾經有一部份人爲之麻醉，但現在的中國，農村經濟，已瀕破壞，社會經濟，已現崩潰，非内部　團給，共同努力，於生産，整個的民族，就有發生危險之虞，所以頽廢淫蕩，良漫，和普羅文藝，只有跟着時代的轉輪而没落下去。</p>
<p>以前也曾有人提倡過民族文學，想在這頽廢，淫蕩，浪漫，普羅，的狂潮中獨樹一幟，可是理想和事實，適得其反，結果，竟成曇華一現而逝，但我終相信民族文學，必有復興的一天，果然，民族文學，在最近一躍而爲時代驕子了。這原因因爲我國近來受帝國主義者的欺侮的迷夢，大家知道世界只有堅强的民族，纔能和人家競爭，現在的時代，是要喚起全民族的共鳴，共同努力於國内生産以復興民族的時代，自然，民族文學，應當應運而生。</p>
<p>文起八代之衰，希望站在時代前面的青年，大家來努力做現代的韓昌黎！</p>
<h3 id="c295">硯的研究（十） <a href="#c295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>端硯概况</p>
<p>（丁）天青　前人論天青，僅以瑩潔無疵，略衆美而色較青，如秋雨乍晴，蔚藍無際者爲上，大抵如瓷器中之雨過天青色之類也。或則稱爲如晨星初没，朝旭未升，有靜穆淵渾之妙；或則稱爲如遠望幕天，表裏瑩潔，此亦不過就各人之所見而狀之，並無一定之名色，而日人則强分爲三種：</p>
<p>（一）似雨過天青，從淡紫色中遥望之而現碧空之色者，爲無上妙品；</p>
<p>（二）微紅青色，如曉天之雜有紅彩者；</p>
<p>（三）微紫灰青，如日落而星未見時之暮天情景者。</p>
<p>此所謂曉天青與暮天青之名稱，以吾人所見，尙未能確認其爲定說，惟去天青如胭脂火捺，流雲點點，或成片散布其中，則是確實的。今天人每以硯之全部青紫色，如從前天青緞色者爲天青，其實此種紫色，乃係老坑端石之本色，非天青也。天青者，必如蕉葉白，周圍雜有雲霞之色彩，斯爲眞品。惟欲確定其孰爲朝天青或暮天青，則甚難耳。吳石華謂青花者，石之榮，魚腦蕉白石之髓，天青石之肉，髓與肉的分别，不過在神色氣韻之間，無大相異，故與魚腦蕉白同列爲美文也。</p>
<p>許修植先生當代之藏硯家亦鑒賞家也，去歳者贈余一天青硯，有青花胭脂暈，確係上品，然究爲朝天青，抑暮天青，則殊未能决定之也。</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>好幾次，好幾次，我想替人家做一個小傳。</p>
<p>畢竟我的朋友，我的親戚，我的……都够不上資格。做傳而物色不着傳中的主人，倒亦是樁煩惱的事呢。</p>
<p>因此，我不得不降格以求，而求到了「後樓阿姨」。</p>
<p>後樓阿姨，没有姓，没有名，因其年方少艾，又住在後樓，故名之。</p>
<p>說到伊的品貌，雖不甚揚，却亦不惡。伊有胖的臉兒，大的鼻子，厚的嘴唇，闊的門牙。至於眼睛，則張開像銅鈴，眯起如一線，瞧人用眼角，顧盼自生姿。面部精華的發源地就在這裏了。</p>
<p>然而，後樓阿姨尙不以此自足，雪花膏哪，花露水哪，胭脂哪（註：伊的胭脂卽紅紙一角）塗了又塗，抹了又抹，不修飾到「遠看好像天仙女，近看猶如活？？」不止。</p>
<p>「後樓阿姨」自稱爲江南對岸人，上海土白中夾些本鄉音。說來婉轉動聽，妙趣横生。生平歡喜賭博，不分日夜，寢食俱廢。丈夫有時回家，要自行「埋鍋造飯」，泡水，洗碗，及拖地板等等勤務屬之。但後樓阿姨猶不能寛恕其丈夫，當伊在菜碗中找出一根洗帚絲，或在飯碗裏吃到一粒磚子後。</p>
<p>有一個黃昏，或許是伊一時「心血來潮」，兀的跑進我的前樓來啦，那能不使我驚惶失措，那能不使我投掉筆站了起來，我偷瞻伊的臉，有着吃人的笑容。「呵……嫂……有什麽……事？」</p>
<p>「看看陳先生的房間。」伊說着，便把眼光向四面打量。</p>
<p>伊見我不會應酬，就出去了。「嘻嘻！陳先生吃嫩來。」</p>
<p>驚魂定了，抽烟一枝，乃作「後樓嫂嫂傳」以傳諸後世。</p>

<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>在二十年的初夏，我結婚以後的唯一結晶品鈺兒，因着痧痘症，就給死神硬生生攫了去。現在眨眨眼，雖快要二年了，可是鈺兒可愛的容顔，悅耳的喚聲，兀是在眼前耳際，時刻縈繞着。在這貧賤夫妻冷冰冰的相對的時候，想起了當年鈺兒活着時承歡膝下的情况，不由不悽然垂下眼淚來。</p>
<p>這眞是一幕凄慘的悲劇，在那年蠶事忙碌的當兒，我的妻爲帮着岳家喂養蠶兒，幹那採桑喂葉的勾當，成日價忙忙碌碌，我又因着吃了酒釀，引發了咯血症，在家養病；因此鈺兒傳染了痧痘症，在初起的當兒，仍住在岳家，簡實聽其自然不當一回事兒。直等到病勢轉劇，才請了一個廉價的醫生，診治病情，可是藥水吃下下去，非但不見起色，反因着迷信痧子出汗病愈的古話，在病榻旁邊煎藥。初夏的樓上，本來已十分燠熱，加着炭火一逼，更是炎熱不堪，鈺兒衰弱的病軀，竟因火熱煎逼，弄入了暈眩的危境。</p>
<p>吾妻起初恐怕我病中着急，將鈺兒的病情，隱瞞着不說，直到這時，才據實告訴，可憐我聽了信息，急急趕到岳家，我那肥碩活潑的鈺兒，已瘦得好像換了個人；鼻息咻咻，兩眼半睜半閉，喉際的痰聲，轆轆的響着，不由我瞧着，從心底翻騰起一般酸意，浮上鼻子，浮上眼簾。我用手摸着那熱熱的頭顱，顫顫呼着「阿鈺；」鈺兒聽了，睜開他疲憊的小眼睛，瞧着我，在那轆轆聲的喉頭，迸出一聲「爹爹！」我竭力噙住的眼淚，早禁不住簌簌直墮下來。唉！鈺兒的病，已早到了危險萬分的境界，然而我的經濟，原是量入爲出的，那時因着我的咯血病，正在服藥，覺得週轉困難；所以鈺兒的病勢，雖兇險異常，都無力請醫生出診醫治，祗得把鈺兒裏着，抱上醫生的門去診視。鈺兒的病，原已異常兇惡，又加着在風中奔波往來，所以那中藥，「羚羊角粉」「珠黃散」，那般貴重藥料吃下去，和西藥的藥膏裹在身上，終於絲毫不生效力，鈺兒的小小生命，終在一個慘淡的朝上消逝了。</p>
<p>那悽慘的情形，眞使我不忍回憶！記得我和妻子在醫生之門，遭了醫生的拒絕，一綫希望，也完全消滅的時候，吾妻抱了鈺兒，坐着人力車，我跟在車後，回到了家裏，鈺兒的淡聲，益發轆轆大響，牙齒也咬得格格有聲，可是他抱到了房裏，那閉了好久的小眼睜，兀是睜開了四面望着，露出戀戀不捨的神情：吾妻抱在臂上，禁不住哀哀的哭，我也放聲哭泣，鈺兒的淡聲，雖逐漸微弱，然而那睜着的眼睛除了迸出眼淚，兀自大大睜着，不肯閉上。鈺兒確是不忍離開他貧窮的父母，然而我却因經濟關係，没有延請名醫，挽救不住這弱小的生命。我和妻對坐在摇桶兩邊，哭望着他那小靈魂的消逝。</p>
<p>當時因不忍這一點骨肉，埋在義塚上，因此暫寄在殯舍裏面，預備冬季，歸葬家塋。可是到了冬裏，一二八的國難，繼續着九一八，突然降臨頭上，在那兵荒戰危的亂離時代，葬事就擱了下來，接着我又患了一次傷寒，靠着生活的電影院，又因營業的不景氣，全部出讓，我在失業的環境裏，掙扎謀生，經濟越見困難，因此鈺兒的葬事，就擱了下來，直至去年我謀到了一家報館的編輯，在竭力緊縮的環境裏，積蓄了三十塊錢，於是在去年雙十節休刊的那天，就和吾妻到墳上去了一回，和墳客談妥了鈺兒落葬的費用，和擇日問題，决意預備把鈺兒埋葬了，了結一樁懸懸的心事。</p>
<p>因着我的咯血症復發，葬兒費變了藥費，然而葬事旣已話妥，又難變更約言，在困難中措得了二十元，在那冷寂的冬天，蕭瑟的祖塋邊上，眼望着那小小的棺木，埋在黃土壟中裏；吾妻的哭聲，震動了林表，風中吼着，人在泣着，我的眼簾，結酸意侵襲，慢慢的藴滿了熱眼，四週的景象，逐漸，逐漸，由清晰而變做了一片糢糊。</p>

<h3 id="c299">美日關係轉變 <a href="#c299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>最近哄動國際的，怕要算是美日關係轉變這一件事了。</p>
<p>美日關係轉變，這是多麽出乎意料之外的！美日關係的緊張，不自今日始了，自從大戰以後，美日資本主義，並駕齊驅的發達，那時兩帝國主戰就開始了極尖銳的接觸，這接觸至前年九一八事件發生，而後達到了空前的緊張程度。一方面是要獨霸東亞；一方面是要東亞利益共享，就是說，美國要在東亞的國際瓜分上，站到一個地位，而且是一個極重要的地位。而日本帝國主義的過度膨脹，則有阻止美國這一企圖實現的危險。這在美國當然萬萬不能容忍的。因此，日本成了美國唯一發展的障碍，而同時，美國則成了日本唯一鬥爭的對象，互相對立，互相鬥爭，美日關係的緊張，就此造成了東亞唯一戰爭的危機，美日戰爭，差不多在每個人嘴裏念着。一九三五年轉瞬將屆，倫敦海軍條約修改問題，南洋日本委任統治地問題，都成了太平洋國際未來的大暗礁。眼看日美帝國主義的矛盾，永是無法解决，未來二次世界大戰的首先在東亞爆發，目前是不可避免的了。</p>
<p>而不料在這個極度緊張的空氣之中，美日關係，却忽以轉變聞，這是一個多有趣而又是出乎意外突如其來的奇怪消息呵。</p>
<p>美日關係轉變，胡蘆裏究竟賣甚麽藥呢？照我看，這没有什麽了不得，顚倒不過是國際帝國主義積極備戰的又一表現而已！</p>
<p>這話怎講？</p>
<p>第一，我們要知道，目前已是臨到了二次世界大戰的前夜。這一戰爭，終必要毁滅一部列强，甚至全部列强。那末怎様可以在二次世界大戰中特别佔到有利的地位，不致走上毁滅的運命呢？這就成爲各帝國主義所熱烈討論的問題了。她們明知戰爭之不可避免，然而却不肯草率的就動手，因爲知道在下次大戰中，一不小心，就有陷於没落的危險。所謂「謀定後動」，現在她們正是「謀」的時候。她們現在所以暫時誰都不肯就開火，就是因爲「謀」尙未「定」。一到謀定，那末她們就立刻開始戰爭了。這是一。</p>
<p>目前的國際政治經濟，旣然是在下次大戰前謀的時候，就是說，是在凖備着戰爭，那末，日美的所謂諒解，其意義也就可知了。就是說，日美的諒解，就是這一「謀」的表現。何以見得呢？因爲，英美的矛盾，不得不使美國分出一部力量來去對付歐洲；而「滿蒙」的尚未積極「建設」，以及與蘇聯對立狀態的存在，又使日本不能不分出一部力量來對付蘇聯及「建設」其所謂「滿蒙」。這様，日美的諒解，就成爲必要了。而其所以要諒解，則正是爲着怎様使自己在未來大戰中可以佔到特别有利的地位。一待凖備完成，則接着便是戰爭上塲，這是一定的事實。這是二。</p>
<p>目前的世界，旣是整個的臨到了戰爭的前夜，而所謂日美的諒解，則不過是列强備戰的另一表現，那未所謂日美諒解，其前途也就可想而知。相反的，這不是和平朕兆，而是世界的危機更促進了一步。</p>
<p>不信嗎？世界經濟恐慌，日深一日，整個資本主義的出路在那裏呢？除開戰爭以外！</p>
<p>倒是很可注意的，是中國的地位！美日諒解的結果，怕不是什麽兩國的講和，而是講好了來平均分配中國罷？不是嗎，美日諒解的第一聲，美國已在凖備承認所謂「滿洲國」了！</p>

<p>前日山東堂邑縣私立武訓中學，寄來武訓先生紀念一册，以一介乞丐，而竟能不避凍餒勞苦，以成就其樂育人材之功，誠不愧爲乞丐之好模範，兹將其事略和照像刊印在下邊。</p>
<p>武訓先生遺像</p>
<p>武訓先生山東堂邑城北武莊農家子，世貧，不數歳，其父宗禹先生卒，倚母崔氏及長兄謙次兄讓孤苦度生。甫弱冠，卽受傭他鄉，傭得之資，輒爲母市甘旨；有時主嘉其勞，而賜以美食，亦必歸遺其母，後傭於其姊家，服役數載，其姊丈欺其愚而昧其値，先生未與爭辯，卽辭去，繼又傭於館陶城東北某庠生家，自春徂冬不付工資，先生忍至翌年，某仍如故，分文不與，且苛責之，先生鬱甚，臥於磨房内不言不食者數日，旋卽辭去，若中瘋迷，人或叩以生名，則弗答，且自稱謂「義學正」</p>
<p>同治初年母卒，與兄等析居，僅業田三畝，悉售之，得錢百二十緡，合其傭得之資共二百十緡，知館陶婁峻嶺君賢，造其門，求代權子母，曰：此吾爲修義學之傭，公其勿辭！婁君以素不識荆，未允，乃長跪不懈，遂許之。</p>
<p>從此，遂棄傭行乞，先生未蓄髮辮，僅於額角留髮如桃式，且左右剃留不定，肩披一破褡，手携一銅勺，鶉衣百結，日遊於市廛里䣊間，沿街呼鬻，以謀工作，或表演技術以博金錢，或拾斷綫殘縷以結線團，又以日久，人皆知先生活格，多器重之，輒出入於土庶之家，雖閨房婦女亦不之避，因此，常爲人成媒灼之約，其乞食得較好之餱糧，則售以求値，零碎糟糲則已食之，無則菜根芋尾以充飢，或以蛇蝎瓦礫果腹，間有以潔水飲先生者，則先洗面而後飲下，其以自苦爲極，而積資生息者有年，</p>
<p>厥後積資漸巨，陸續購置田地，有勸之娶者，則堅拒，仍行乞，宿無定所，一夜，宿於米家堂村破廟中，不幸廟頂墜落一瓦，傷其頭，仍謳歌自勵，晝赴城市語皆成韻，似戨似詩，總以創修義與爲辭，</p>
<p>光緒初年，積資已數萬，其衣敝食粗者如故，是時先生以積資購紅糧若干，其兄託鄉鄰乞貸，先生不許，所置田租於其兄，而不納金，行生遂辭去，又有館陶西二莊郜某欠先生本利金二百餘緡，屢討不予，且撞嚇先生欲與興訟，先生乃置不再討。迨十二年冬購地二百三十餘畝，乃央求柳林鎭楊樹芳字模民君爲之招佃租種，并經理其餘資。</p>
<p>當先生之初議建學，曾買武莊宅基一區，計値六百七十餘緡，因嫌局勢狹小，且恐日後武氏侵佔，乃囑楊君在柳林鎭擇一校址，適有郭君芬者捐地一畝八分，在該鎭東圩門外，遂築屋二十四楹，以及大門垣墉，不月告成，延名師爲之主講，因而文人萃集。先生每延師入門，卽傴僂迎迓，豐筵相欵，敎師偶</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>有倦寢，則長跪床側，或敎師因事旋里，返校愆期，先生則星夜奔馳其家，肅然跪請，學生有惰者，則於他人不見時勸之，不聽則跪而哀勸之！故校内師生之勤奮爲一時冠，維又擴充義學於鄰封，先生乃益刻苦積資，館陶莊科村千佛寺，戒僧了證慕先生之爲人，遂罄其積蓄捐輸之，因此，在楊二莊置田百餘畝，購宅一所，築房十餘間，延師課讀亦如柳林之義學，爾時，堂邑縣令郭公聞先生之名，曾延之署中治筵以待，先生生平此乃第一次進美餐也。又適有裕德以侍郎來東視學，先生則攬與求捐，慨予捐銀二百兩。更以臨清縣縉紳之贊助，復在臨清城御史巷購宅一所，事未蕆，先生竟以殁，幸賴王丕顯君，繼續經營，得成先生之賷志。當先生抱病時其侄克信往視之，先生不與之言，臨終猶睨視之。</p>
<p>謹按先生於道光十八年十月十九日卯時生，光緒二十二年四月二十三日午時卒，遵遺囑葬於堂邑柳林鎭先生手建義學之東壁外。（却酬）</p>
<h3 id="c301">女人與哭 <a href="#c301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>「英雄有涙不輕流」這就是表示硬男子漢不會隨便就哭哭啼啼的一種鐵石心腸。然而女人則不，女人是頂容易眼淚横縱的，尤其是在男子前面的時候，女人的淚更是便宜出售。女人之與　　以說是二位一體，也並不是過火的話，這種事實差不多無時無之。</p>
<p>女人每逢遇到不愜意的遭際，或刺激過利害之間，一時不顧一切，於是大哭特哭，把哭當做唯一的自慰的方法，男人方面則不盡然，在同様情形之下，他只有咬着牙根忍耐，沉默，想辦法應付。這固然不是說男人不會哭，不過女人的哭總比男人特别來得多，哭，本來不是一件完全算壞的事，一個人當其心境惡鬱達於極端，苦悶無法發洩，總想能够放聲大哭一塲的，好像一切的悲哀煩惱借此一哭哭出來，哭過之後心頭多少會舒暢一下；於生理上或不無補益之處，這或者可以拿來解說人爲什麽有時喜歡哭的道理。但是女人之特别嗜好哭，以及哭之以女人除了基上原因之外，尙有一番意味在這意味，範圍祇限於女人與男子間的關係，在這塲合之下，女人的哭有一種不可思議的魔力，聰明的女人也就利用爲對付男子的隨身法寳。所謂「女人涙消英雄心」，便是明證。我們時常可以看見夫妻情人之間，往往因爲爭辯一件事，女的强不過男的，而又不肯退步或認輸，於是她就放出最後的法寳來，倒到牀上，低低幽幽的啜泣起來，或是皇天后土的大哭個痛快，含着淚眼嗚嗚咽咽的訴說着，像受了什麽委曲似的，不問有理無理。而男人在這時眼見那凄切嬌嗔的情態。不免又恨又愛，但愛的成份總是多於恨，硬心腸也就因此一哭哭軟下來了。反悔不該討没趣，無端惹起一塲風波，於是你不但自動取消火　　　　　會自然而然地　到女人的身邊，撫摸她的頭髮，低心下意地安慰着，說上了一大篇好話。這末勝利是全屬於她的，女人覺得滿足。於是馬上破哭爲笑，一幕悲喜劇也就完了。女人的哭，實在是對待男子的最好的手段，也是一種最犀利最有力量的方法。且哭，原來便是很有傳染性的東西，一聞人哭你就不禁生起同情或爲其傷心，因爲人都是有情感作用的，除非你一塊木頭不說。何况是女人那種富於音韻律的婉囀的哭，那任你是一個怎様薄倖無情的硬心漢，祗敎一碰到女人的哭，多少總要被感動過去的，故哭，是女人一種特有的技巧，用來對付男子的精明的技巧。</p>

<p>— 小喬</p>
<p>春天，醉人的春天啊，昨夜的夢也太使人驚奇了。</p>
<p>急雨打在窗上，已是黃昏時候。我躺在沙發椅内嚼着米古力糖，有一眼没一眼地瞧着一山春裝圖。女人都是可愛的，苗條的身材，穿着那般窄狹的旗衫，舉處她們兩條藕様肉臂，返過頭來，抛着眼風瞇着你，好像說：「愛我罷，我是個青春的少女啊！」</p>
<p>笑着抽起烟來，也　了一隻睛眼瞇了她一眼。她好像笑我，笑我太没有勇氣，爲什麽不把愛着的少女緊緊的摟抱起來呢？痴的，那是畫片啊。我翻着，一幅一幅在我眼前滾過的，那是那般輕盈的少女。</p>
<p>「少女們誠然是美的，</p>
<p>誠是是輕盈，</p>
<p>誠然是擁抱她，吻着她，</p>
<p>可以慰你生命的勞頓。」</p>
<p>抱着圖册，　上眼睛，抽着捲烟，着雨馨，我像依偎在愛人懷中催眠了。</p>
<p>門開了，那個輕盈的少女穿春裝圖上的衣服，微笑的注視着我，那様迷人。站定了半嚮，見我没有動靜，跳着華爾滋的步伐輕輕地走近來，笑得更迷人了。這時候我不問她倒底是誰，站起身來擁着她。她像没有骨骼似的依在我的懷中，仰着頭，微閉了長睫毛的眼睛，嘴角微露着笑容，她等待着我，等待着我，一個熱烈的醉吻。</p>
<p>然而我不能太放肆，對於少女應該輕輕的摩撫軟軟的温存，然後吻她，她會感謝你的美意的。她半嚮，好像停止了呼吸，微微的睜開眼來，和我的對個正着，她又微微地閉上了。</p>
<p>忽然門開處一個古羅馬的武士出現在我面前，他拔出佩刀就向我刺來。少女忙掙脫了我的抱懷，隔在我們兩人中間，摇着頭，憂怨的様子向武士怒視着，那武士無力的收回佩刀，拉了少女的手臂向外就走。門碰的一聲我從夢中醒來。</p>
<p>懷中抱着春裝圖册，半段捲烟在烟盤冒出臭味來，窗上的雨聲没有停止，瞧着時計，僅是五分鐘的夢境，又回到這小屋子來了。我把圖册直翻到那少女的一頁，和夢中一般無二的模様，瞇着眼睛對我說：「愛我罷，我是個青春的少女啊！」</p>
<p>我惡意的把春裝册向床上抛去，封面上的古羅馬武士正拔着佩刀和誰角力似的。我笑了，抓起一粒米古力糟來慢慢的咀嚼。</p>

<h3 id="c307">一九三四年幾個新明星的題名錄 <a href="#c307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>一九三四年的來臨，一切都很明顯地與前不同了。在歐美的影壇上，尤其是在變幻莫測的好萊塢，明星們的新陳代謝，此起彼伏，已經造成一個特有的局面。舊有的明星，如曼麗璧克馥，史璜生，范朋克輩，他們已經成爲過去的人物了。一九三四年已經成爲新明星們角逐的年代，雖然還有不少老練的舊明星還能利用他們的不斷的奮鬥站住他們原有的地位，但是喜新厭舊的觀衆們已經移轉他們的目光於那些後起之秀了，下面的幾個明星便是新近跳上銀壇而得到觀衆歡迎的幸運兒呢。現在分列介紹如下。</p>
<p>梅維絲Ｍae　Ｗest（女星，拍拉蒙。）這個風騷總慧的的少婦，她有着敏感的頭腦，和富有風情的獨特的作風。自身編得一手好劇本，而且積多年的觀察的經騐，深刻了悟現世紀一般觀衆的要求。她懂得這個社會是男人的社會，她抓住了男子做她的觀衆對象。她這試騐竟收到意外的成功。地的兩部新作「地獄之花」“She　Done　Him　Wrong”和「儂本多情」“Im　NoAngel”博得世人（男人居多）的驚歎。紐約百老匯歡迎她新片的狂熱情形，使許多老牌明星都又姑又羨，没有一個情願去參加。現在她已經成了一般男觀衆的偶像了。</p>
<p>李屈山Lee　Tracy（男星，福斯公司）在後進的男星中，最受到觀衆的歡迎的，恐怕要算是李屈山了。但他並不是翩翩佳公子，也不是以憐香借玉爲拿手戯。他却是完全以活潑的表演以及流利的口才稱雄於這個有聲電影界。他是紐約忙人都會中的典型人物，輕快，率直，而爽利的表演，自成一種特有的派别，博得英語民族的觀衆熱烈的愛好，美國電影雜誌時常把觀衆稱頌他的函件連篇累牘的登載出來，可見一班。他入影界爲時甚暫，作品有「胡說」Nuisence”「夢裏乾坤」“Turn　Back　The　Crock”</p>
<p>桃樂第藢克Dorochea　Wieck（女星，拍拉蒙）她是新近給好萊塢往德國拉來的一個女演員。她在「女性之光」“Madam　in　Uniform”一片中露現她的偉大的表演天才，她是一個代表高尚貞潔的典型人物，是好萊塢最缺乏的一種性格。她到美國後的第一部主演的影片是呌做，「小明星被刦案」Miss　Fane's　Baby　is　Stolen”</p>
<p>傑克蒲拉Jan　Kiepura（男星·英國高蒙公司）他是馳名歐洲大陸的歌唱大家。原籍是羅馬尼亞國人。但英國人却當他做本國人一様的宜傳着。在這音樂片正爲世人熱烈歡迎的年頭，他的聞名世界的歌喉自可以博得一般的贊賞。在「春江花月夜」“Ｔell　Me　Tonight”一片中初試鋒芒，造成歐洲影片的售座新記錄。在澳大利亞洲的雪萊埠連映了六個月之久。英人且引爲本國影片的榮譽出品，他的新片還有「名歌傾城」“City　of　Song”成績亦佳。</p>
<p>法蘭却通Franchot　Tone（男星，米高梅這拉翩翩的少年，穿着最時髦的服裝以及闊綽的物質享受的一個新人物。是美國豪貴子弟的典型，是白種女性夢寐中的代表的男性。無疑地已爲一般女性觀衆所歡迎了。在最近鍾老勞馥的新焉中「飛燕驚鳳“The　Dacing　Lady”担任男角，據說他已經是鍾小姐的情人了。聽說鍾小姐的前夫小范朋克坦白地批評說：「要我出一個比法蘭却通代再漂亮的男子是决找不到的呢！」</p>
<p>瑪珈雷蘇力文Magaret　Sullavan（女星，環球公司）這位夢中的情形，美麗的姑娘。她在舊怨新愁」“Only　Yesterday”裏只像驚鴻一瞥似的，但她的美麗超異的印象已經深印在一般觀衆的心坎中了。</p>
<p>亞多克羅搿Ｏtto　Kruger（男星，廿世紀公司）他是紐約百老匯舞台上的紅明星，在一九三三年開始他的銀幕生活，一年中給中世紀公司拍了六部片子。他是一個和藹的中年人，以表演深刻爲一般觀衆所歡迎。</p>
<p>裘恩娜德June　Knight（女星，環球公司）這位艷若桃李冷若冰霜的聰頴女性，她是紐約百老匯舞台上的著名坤伶之一。她進電影界不過祗一年多，在環球提拔之後，首次由導演大家紐滂氏Du　pont選爲「路柳牆花」“Ladies　Must　Love”主角，成績果然一鳴驚人。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c308">評「誰是凶手」 <a href="#c308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— 高原</p>
<p>“Matinee　idol”光陸蘭心丨</p>
<p>這是一個名優被妬殺的故事。</p>
<p>爲什麽受人的嫉妬呢，不待我說，十個有九個都會猜得中的，是爲了「藝術絕倫，」而「爲女性所崇拜，」結果是追逐者們之間，由愛而恨，以至於拿出手槍，傷害她最心愛的人。</p>
<p>這様的「浪漫事」在現代社會是常見的，雖然謀殺的方式，和過程事實，各有不同，而動機則一。這種動機的社會原因，無国疑的是資本主義；社會的私有制度反映到男女關係上所形成的，因爲男女間互相絕對的要求「獨佔，」要求一種個人主義的極端發展，就有這種事態發生。</p>
<p>在這裏，我聯想到最近中國電影演員艾霞的自殺。雖說動機的原因大同小異，在根本上，没有認識清楚所受痛苦的社會原因，而中了現社會的毒不能自拔，却是一様。社會的發展是有牠的前途的，生活在其中的人不能認識把握牠的前途，而求個人的出路，是無辦法的</p>
<p>編劇導演的創作態度還算愼重，並不糊亂的雜漬。一件妬殺的疑案，並不處理得像一張荒誕的偵探片，名優的愛人克里絲克爲了怕連累的自己的情敵又是姊姊的沙尼亞而自首；结際是凶手而又熱愛名優的女配角葛迪最後留書自殺；於情理上都有可能，在凶手說起來她也是殉情了。</p>
<p>除了這一幹線以外，名優鄰居凱壁德夫人的穿挿，致使警署得到凶手綫索，重要，單純，而又有趣。犯嚴肅的空氣裏加入了喜劇的氣氛，不破壞整個空氣，反加强了全劇的力量，雖然大部份凱壁德夫人的出現是在窗口，很自然，直到最後一個鏡頭她還老太婆様的在咕嚕咕嚕的，不僅只有趣，給觀衆一種自然輕鬆的感覺，也正因爲這種典型在生活中是眞有的，這種表現是切合的。</p>
<p>Miles　Mander的名優，一副劍客的神氣，在前台後台以及日常生活的，所表現的，都確有「名優」風味，Marguerite　Allen在活潑天眞中又多情，NiolaKeats一上塲，就穿着黑色斑白花的衣服，强調她恐怖，隂毒，苦悶的性格，而她的表情動作也帶着這種意味，Hay　Pettie的男鄰，Margaret　Yarde的女鄰，表情動作十分達出他們劇中人的性格。</p>
<p>光線，裝置，導演者George　King能依照劇的情緒發展來配製，使强調劇的效果，也是他用了心的。全劇對白很清楚。</p>
<h3 id="c309">評「卞昆岡」 <a href="#c309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨丨光華映丨丨</p>
<p>「卞昆岡」據說是徐志摩的遺著，而由陸小曼編劇的。因此，頗使人相當注意。</p>
<p>關於徐志摩，我們不能否認他在中國文壇的功績。有人說：中國的資本主義文化的代表者，在文化方面，我們不能忘懷胡適之，而在文藝方面，却要提出徐志摩了。的確，他對於西洋文化的介紹，有着不可磨滅的成績，但他所介紹的，却都是已經糜爛了的或者是開始糜爛的東西。這様的東西，對於中國自然是害多益少的了。自然，徐志摩是一個熱情的浪漫主義者，這在他的詩歌作品上可以看得出來。假使說他也把握了現實，但是却因着不正確的觀察而歪曲了現實，因之更不能把握現實之必然的發展。</p>
<p>然而我很抱憾，關於他的東西，我讀得很少，特别是這「卞昆岡」的劇本，更没有讀過。所以現在我只能就電影上所表現出來的而略抒已見。當然，一個文藝作品，常常要被電影商人所歪曲，在歐美影片中，我們可舉出不少例證。同様，爲了電影的表現手法的不同，如文藝作品常有不少出入，也是必然的事實。所以，也許原著並不像電影那様一般無二。不過編劇者陸小曼女士，却應當是負責者了。</p>
<p>「卞昆岡」到底表現了一些什麽東西呢？也許可以這様說，卞昆岡是一個石匠，但是他却是詩人眼中的藝術家。他的妻子死後，對於他愛的收獲丨丨女兒阿明，愛護異常，不欲續絃，以免後母虐待他的女兒。但是藝術家却是一個孝子。字幕上說：因爲母親要卡昆岡娶新寡婦李七妹，可是在面畫上告訴我們說，他到底是和李七妹發生了愛情，所以才娶了來的。到後來李七妹仍和從前一様不肯安分守己，和一個掌櫃的來往。結果是卡昆岡的娘因此氣死，女兒給奸夫淫婦弄瞎了眼睛，而且殺死了。於是奸夫淫婦私奔，卡昆岡一氣之下，便投井自殺。這時他的徒弟義憤塡胸，在大雨之中要爲師傅復仇。不過天網恢恢，疏而不漏，李七妹和那掌櫃的到底給雷公打死在樹林中，徒弟趕來，已是不用下手了。</p>
<p>就是這麽一個故事，雖然其中還加了一個瞎子，在旁冷笑熱嘲，可是更加使人莫明其妙。我想這是用不着解釋的，在目前的中國電影中，還有這種宣揚淺薄的忠孝節義之庸俗的因果報應的影片，眞是影壇中的怪現象。</p>
<p>現在我們再看看導演的給了我們一些什麽？只消舉出一個你證來；李七妹嫁給卡昆岡之後，她爲什麽會不安分的？她是怎様的不安分？而且他母親爲什麽會氣死？這些都没有在畫面上說明。這除了在說明書上嚕囌的說了一大堆之後，我們的導演只是很聰明的以一字幕了之。</p>
<p>至於主角的表演，自首至尾是裝腔作態，有些鐵公鷄的味兒，也有唱文明戯的味兒。女主角在前部略有鄉村女人的可取之處，後部也是不行。其他諸人自不待言。</p>
<h3 id="c310">「烈焰」明天公映 <a href="#c310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>確實，藝華公司是大膽的！</p>
<p>因爲塲面偉大的影片，在中國是不敢嘗試的多，而藝華公司的處女作「中國海的怒潮，」非但塲面偉大，更且在浩瀚汪洋之中做戯，這眞益顯其偉大了。現在，又有一部較「中國海的怒潮」更雄偉的影片出世了，這片又是從藝華公司産生出來，那便是胡銳導演，彭飛胡萍主演的「烈焰」。</p>
<p>「烈焰」的導演是輕鬆而尖刻的，演員表情是沉毅而活潑的，攝影是美麗而新頴的，一切它都是很不平凡。這片經南京電檢會檢查通過後，定明天起在北京大戯院公映了。</p>

<p>— 文印</p>
<p>「婦順北方嗎」？威爾很難置信地問着，他想一個人，南方北方，難道可以自由選擇的嗎？瓊娜笑問道：「你最恨的是北方，是不是？」威爾很嚴重似的說道：「他們將我們毁滅了」！瓊娜道：「那個時候，你還没有生。威爾先生，你的記憶力眞强」！威爾有些着惱了，他說：「你以爲那是好的，是不是」？瓊娜道：「你爲什麽這様在乎呢」？威爾心裏很不痛快，不過外表上還是裝着笑臉說道：「好了，今天的功課完了」。瓊娜從籬笆上，一躍而下，她說：「功課完了，先生可以回家了」。威爾連忙攔住了她說道：「你别走。你的話是對的，瓊娜；我抱歉得很。現在我們一笑就完了」。瓊娜對他微微地笑着。威爾催着她道：「你怎麽不笑，你饒恕我了嗎」？於是他們就很痛快的笑了，一同在田裏巡視着那些菸草。</p>
<p>許多早種的，是她父親的手澤，現在已經開花了。瓊娜聞着菸草花的香味，連聲的讚美着。威爾說道：「老實說，我們就不喜歡種菸草」。瓊娜看了他一眼說道：「根本你們什麽都不種，田裏長的，全是些敗草」。威爾道：「那都是没有錢的緣故。謝謝北方，他們是立志來害南方人的……你的祖母告訴過你没有」？瓊娜說；「没有，她說南北之戰，雙方都有錯誤的」。桱爾道：「恐怕你的祖母，是不喜歡南方人的吧」？瓊娜道；「不是的。她本來要嫁一個南方人的。後來那個人打仗死了，她就跑到北方，嫁了我的祖父。不過她對於她第一個愛人，却是終身没有忘記」。威爾想起了佛琴妮快來了，就說道：「一個人的婚姻，很少能自己作主的」。瓊娜道：「那未到底爲什麽一起要結婚呢」？威爾道：「理由很多……錢就是一個……」瓊娜生氣道：「錢？你用不着爲錢而犧牲自己的幸福呀。你祇要自己奮鬥好了」。威爾抓了她的臂膀跳過了一個田岸，然後說道：「你這個人，倒是怪特别的。請你講給我聽聽，像這様的一塊莊田，没有錢怎様耕種法」？瓊娜說道：「將所有的田，一齊整頓起來……」威爾不等她說完，將手一揮笑道：「種它一大片的菸草」！瓊娜道：「你覺得好笑嗎？我倒不覺得好笑。種菸草是極賺錢的」。威爾還說着笑話道：「一個男人在一個時候，祇可以吸一口烟。你種了這許多菸草，誰來用呢？難道女人亦呌她們吸烟嗎」？瓊娜笑道：「那亦可以的。你不知道，我種的菸草，本來是做紙烟的菸草呀」。</p>
<p>他們正在辯駁得起勁的時候，羅伯走上前來，呌威爾到車站上，去迎接佛琴妮去。於是威爾就很不高興的和瓊娜告了别去了。瓊娜在田岸上坐了下來，不自不覺心中好像有什麽感觸似的，眼睛直瞪瞪望着威爾消逝的後影。（未完）</p>

The meeting adjourned after two hours. (Special Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Distribution Method for Cotton and Wheat Loans <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The plenary session of the National Economic Committee approved the distribution method for cotton and wheat loans. The original loan was for 50 million US dollars, with 40 million for American cotton, 6 million for wheat, and 4 million for flour. At the market prices at the time, this was equivalent to approximately 200 million national currency. The contract has now been revised, reducing the cotton to 10 million, and the wheat and flour to 10 million, totaling 20 million. Based on current gold prices, this is equivalent to over 50 million national currency. According to the contract, the principal must be repaid in gold within three months of the goods arriving. After deducting freight charges, the amount that can be used is only 40 million. Requests for allocation have reached 102,368,380 yuan, exceeding the amount by more than two and a half times, making it impossible to allocate. The Standing Committee members have set the following principles: (1) Concentrate resources on important projects; (2) Designate specific locations for certain projects; (3) Temporarily postpone projects that cannot be accomplished with limited funds. Last year, the Central Political Council resolved that 40% of the loan should be used for currency reform and financial reorganization, with 14 million allocated for financial reorganization, to be managed by the Central Bank, and the remaining 6 million to develop civil aviation, 1.8 million for Ganzhou governance, and 1 million for consultation fees. The committee spent 200,000 on road construction in the past year's 10th, 11th, and 12th months. The current remaining balance is only 15 million. It has now been decided to use this amount for the committee's projects, such as continuing the construction of the seven-province connecting highway, for which 6.5 million is planned; 500,000 for public health; 1.9 million for Ganzhou construction; 2.5 million for Northwest construction; 1 million for cotton industry regulation; 750,000 for sericulture improvement; 64,000 for tea industry improvement; 100,000 for fuel research; and 200,000 for investigative research. The remainder will be used as a reserve fund. According to the above allocation, agriculture and water conservancy do not seem to be included. However, large-scale water conservancy projects, such as the Yellow River water conservancy project, require 14 million, so they are not included for the time being. As for agricultural funding, the actual amount included is quite substantial, such as cotton, sericulture, silk, and tea. Furthermore, Northwest construction includes 400,000 for animal husbandry and 400,000 for rural cooperative enterprises, and the Ganzhou construction fund has 500,000 designated for agricultural cooperation, totaling approximately 3.11 million. It is simply not listed under the name of agriculture. The above allocation is the most important proposal passed by the plenary session. In addition, there are eleven other proposals, many of which are temporarily postponed due to infeasibility. Other proposals, such as those related to Hebei water conservancy and mining, will be handled by the Executive Yuan. (Central News Agency Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Glimpses of Other Important Proposals <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the first plenary session of the National Economic Committee on the afternoon of the 26th, in addition to approving the distribution method for American cotton and wheat loans, more than ten other important proposals were discussed and resolved. (1) Peng Xuepei's proposal to change to a gold standard transition method: The method includes: 1. The government should allow the Central Bank to issue gold banknotes with a reserve ratio similar to that of silver banknotes, guaranteeing that the reserve should not exceed 40%. 2. Gold and silver banknotes should circulate simultaneously without a fixed exchange rate. 3. The gold coin unit should be equal to one-quarter of the gold unit currently used by customs. 4. The Central Bank should increase reserves as much as possible to issue gold banknotes. 5. Banks can obtain gold banknotes from the Central Bank using the same method as obtaining silver banknotes. 6. Private individuals exchanging gold bars or goldware for gold banknotes at the Central Bank should be exempt from handling fees. 7. Gold banknotes should have unlimited legal tender status. 8. At a suitable time, government revenue and expenditure should be calculated in gold coins. 9. The Central Bank should gradually increase its gold reserves. 10. Gold banknotes can only be redeemed for cash in amounts of 5,000 yuan or more, and the Central Bank may pay with an immediate or sixty-day gold exchange draft. 11. Banks may accept gold bars, goldware, etc., calculate their value in gold coins, and use them as gold coin deposits. It was decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Finance's Currency System Committee for research. (2) Wang Shijie's proposal to establish a National Academic Work Advisory Office jointly by the Economic Committee and the Ministry of Education: The method involves the Ministry of Education and the Economic Committee jointly establishing a National Academic Work Advisory Office, located within the Economic Committee, with branch offices to be established overseas if necessary. The annual expenditure required is 5,000 yuan, with the Economic Committee paying the shortfall of 4,000 yuan. It was resolved to pass the proposal and hand it over to the Standing Committee for handling. (3) Li Tianni, the representative from Shandong, proposed increasing food prices to alleviate rural bankruptcy, advocating for: 1. Blocking the import of foreign flour, rice, and wheat. 2. Reducing railway freight charges and exempting consolidated taxes to facilitate merchant sales. 3. Government and local authorities should purchase and store grain. It was resolved to hand it over to the Executive Yuan for implementation. (4)</p>

Improving crop varieties. 4. Promoting American cotton. 5. Large-scale afforestation. 6. Promoting rural cooperation. It was resolved to hand it over to the Standing Committee for handling. (5) Li Tianni, the representative from Shandong, proposed allocating cotton and wheat loans to redeem the Jiaoji Railway to enrich the economy and strengthen national defense, advocating that the Jiaoji Railway Committee should issue public bonds with an annual saving of 2 million yuan, which could raise 10 to 20 million. The remaining deficit should be allocated from the cotton and wheat loans. It was resolved to hand it over to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Railways for review and handling. (6) Committee member Chen Bozhuang proposed principles for controlling the coal industry. (7) Lu Mutin, the representative from Hebei, proposed [illegible] the mining industry in Hebei Province.

<p>He Cables Ma to Disband Troops Appropriately</p>
<p>The War Zone is Preparing for Emergency Relief</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying and Fu ZhanKui arrived in Baotou late on the 25th and immediately received 20,000 yuan in living expenses from the Military Council, which was distributed to the officers and families of his troops stationed in Baotou. After staying for one or two days, he will come east. The problem of the post-Sun army was previously telegraphed to Chiang for instructions by the Beiping military authorities. Chiang replied yesterday, ordering the Military Council to handle it properly. After receiving the telegram, the Beiping military authorities felt that the current situation was slightly different from before, so the appropriateness of the previously determined method was questionable. He has now sent separate telegrams to Ma Hongkui and others, ordering them to consider the actual situation, distinguish between the good and the bad, and disband the troops appropriately. According to a telegram from Ningxia, Pingluo County and the area between Ningyuan and Shuoxian were the most severely damaged by Sun's army's invasion. The provincial government is currently preparing for emergency relief and will issue loans for spring plowing. (Special Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying arrived in Baotou last night. The area near Ningxia is peaceful, and preparations for post-war recovery have begun. Loans will be issued first to facilitate spring plowing. However, many houses in Dengkou and Pingluo were demolished and burned by Sun's army, and the disaster situation is severe, requiring urgent relief. It is still difficult to determine whether Sun will go to Tianjin or Taiyuan. Regarding the post-Sun army, the area between Ningyuan and Shizuizi will be handled by Zhu Shaoliang in conjunction with Ma Hongkui's troops, while the area north of Shizuizi will be the responsibility of the Jin-Sui army. It is reported that the surrendered troops will be reorganized according to the number of seven regiments verified by the Military Council. (Special Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhankui telegraphed Beiping this morning, saying that he and Sun Dianying arrived in Baotou on the evening of the 25th.

<p>(Beiping) It is rumored that Sun Dianying has decided to live in Tianjin and has sent people to arrange a residence. (Special Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Hongkui, the Chairman of Ningxia, telegraphed the central government, stating that the four counties of Xia, Shuo, Ping, and Deng suffered the most severe damage as a result of Sun Dianying's westward advance against orders.

<h3 id="e25">Respectfully Offered to the National Economic Council Meeting - Source <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>| Developing the Northwest and Government Flour Loans |</p>
<p>The National Economic Council is now holding its first plenary session in the capital. It is a grand event where national leaders from all sectors are jointly planning major construction projects. Among the main topics of this session are the development of the Northwest and the reduction of cotton and wheat flour loans, both of which have a profound impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. I venture to briefly describe the relationship between developing the Northwest and government flour loans, based on my limited understanding, to contribute to the deliberations of the committee members. According to the cotton and wheat flour loan agreement, although there is talk of revisions, the content of the revision is to reduce the American cotton portion from 40 million US dollars to 10 million US dollars, while the wheat flour portion remains unchanged. As I suggested in an article titled "Disposition of Government Wheat Flour" (see this newspaper's January 11th current affairs commentary), the government should develop the Northwest, using labor as relief and flour as currency, to solve the problem of unavoidable wheat flour loans and to help the development of the Northwest. Although foreign wheat is needed by our country, flour can be produced domestically. If the government wants to sell expensive foreign flour domestically, it will inevitably compete with domestic flour sales. Not only will the government suffer significant losses, but the flour industry will also be severely hit. In this case, construction has not yet been realized, but industry is destroyed first, which is certainly not the original intention of the loan. Taking a step back, even if manufacturers undertake the sales, the factories can avoid the losses from competition, but the new domestic wheat will soon be on the market, and no one will be interested in buying it. It is still harmful and not beneficial to our rural areas. Those concerned about rural revitalization will naturally not agree with this. Therefore, instead of converting the flour loan into cash and then using the cash for construction, it is better to directly apply the flour loan to construction projects. Taking the development of the Northwest as an example, the problem of food for the workers must be solved first. If the flour loan is directly applied, it will be simple and easy to implement. However, some may worry about the excessive transportation costs. This point is really worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Let us consider: Once tens of thousands of people in the Northwest are engaged in large-scale development work, the amount of food they consume will be very large. How should it be supplied? Development work requires a lot of labor. With the poverty of the Northwest, it is impossible to collect food locally or purchase it from nearby. To avoid affecting the local people's food supply, it must be imported from outside. It can be seen that the transportation cost is a necessary expenditure for the development of the Northwest. No matter how large the amount or how difficult the planning, it must be done with effort. We should view the development of the Northwest as being as important as suppressing the Red bandits. If the spirit of planning military expenses for suppressing the Red bandits is used to plan transportation costs, the difference in difficulty cannot be measured by distance. Moreover, according to the actual situation, the government does not need to raise huge sums of money immediately. Ocean liners can carry foreign flour from the United States to China and dock at Pukou and Jianggan. The flour can be unloaded and transferred to the Jinpu and Longhai railways, directly reaching Tongguan. This section of transportation costs can be recorded on account and does not require cash. West of Tongguan, it can be gradually advanced along the existing highways or rivers using cars, civilian boats, or light railways. After that, although transportation becomes more difficult and costs become more expensive, the value of the flour loan will also increase. It can be asserted. Some may cite the experience of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee in previous years, believing that it is more economical to convert the wheat into cash in Shanghai and pay the workers in cash than to transport wheat from Shanghai to the development work site and pay in wheat. However, the reason for this move by the Flood Relief Committee was that the provinces along the Yangtze River had a bumper harvest one year after the disaster, and local grain prices were cheaper. Firstly. Secondly, for disaster relief work, the wages earned, if calculated in wheat flour, would have a surplus after consumption, which would have to be sold locally before purchasing miscellaneous items or saving a little. One more transfer means one more loss. Now, the situation of the workers developing the Northwest is very different from that of the disaster relief workers, so the treatment they receive should also be different. Today, developing the Northwest and employing local workers is intended to provide relief through work and is primarily aimed at universality. Since the development funds are limited, the workers' remuneration must be inversely proportional to their number. This is unavoidable. I believe that, in addition to the government providing food, clothing, housing, and medical care, the workers should not have much private savings. However, during their spare time, the government should provide them with elementary education and training. Those whose work is above the standard should have points added, and those below the standard should have points deducted. After working for one or two years, their performance should be evaluated, and they should be given appropriate land, houses, seeds, and agricultural tools to organize collective farms, so that they can return to agriculture and live in peace and contentment. Therefore, the ratio of the workers' work unit to the amount of flour needed should be smaller than that of the disaster relief workers. Moreover, transportation in the Northwest is inconvenient, and grain prices are actually higher than in other places. The experience of the Flood Relief Committee does not seem to be applicable here.</p>
<p>Alas, since the world's economic recession, the number of unemployed people has increased dramatically. Governments around the world are working hard to plan and spend huge amounts of money to seek relief. In the United States, there are agencies such as the CCC, which organize unemployed people to mine forests and undertake other public works. The scale is very grand. Looking back at our country, although there are many people waiting for relief, the flames of rebellion are still raging. Our government is striving to suppress the Red bandits, and the largest financial expenditure is the military expense for suppressing the Red bandits. Although it has the heart to relieve unemployment, its financial resources are insufficient. Therefore, as a second-best option, it has to choose the Northwest, the poorest place, the most suffering people, the most abundant natural resources, and the most critical national defense relationship, to start with first. Now, try to announce to the tens of thousands of fellow countrymen in the Northwest who are groaning in human hell, "The government wants to develop the Northwest and needs manpower. If you come to build roads, dredge rivers, and do all kinds of construction work, you can be provided with food and clothing. After two years, you will be given land to cultivate and houses to live in. In years of good harvest, the produce will be for your own use. In years of famine and drought, the government will maintain you." Then I know that there will be thunderous cheers and everyone will celebrate their rescue. Therefore, using labor as relief to help those in need and using flour loans to develop the Northwest are the most urgent tasks today. I hope that the gentlemen of the Economic Committee will complete this great plan as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If the U.S. Withdraws, Japan Will Follow and Invade</p>
<p>British and French Interests in the Far East Feel Increasingly Threatened</p>
<p>Relevant Countries Should Take Joint Action</p>
<p>(Paris) The first page of the "Le Jour" newspaper published a commentary on the Far East issue, headlined "The Independence of the Philippine Islands Will Facilitate Japan's External Expansion." The author believes that the independence of the Philippine Islands now seems to be a reality, and states that the independence of the Philippines is a major event in Far East history. We should pay close attention to the events that occur in the Philippines in the future. The resources of the Philippines can support 50 million people, but the current population is only 12 million, most of whom are Malay. Japan's population is increasing rapidly, and it will take the opportunity to enter. With the Japanese people's tenacity and cleverness, they will follow and invade the Philippines after the Americans withdraw. There is no doubt that the independence of the Philippines will promote the development of the Japanese into the Malay Peninsula and Singapore. (26th Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) The European edition of the "New York Evening Post" published an article by the famous American journalist Walter Lippmann, discussing the arms race among various countries in a very thorough manner. It briefly states that the arms race among countries in the world today is not just a bluff, but a real fact. This fact will inevitably plunge the people of the world into the horrors of war. Politicians of the great powers are ignoring the fundamental issues of war and peace, and are only preoccupied with the trivial details of tanks, cannons, and warships, which is a mistake. The situation in the Pacific has reached an extremely serious level, but it is not entirely without hope. If the United States can unite with China, Japan, Russia, Britain, and France, and engage in calm diplomatic action, peace can still be guaranteed. However, the opportunity should not be missed, otherwise, the future of the Pacific will become more and more bleak, and the arms race will become more and more intense. The following is a summary of Lippmann's original text, which is translated in full below.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Japan Breaks Treaties <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The arms race is no longer just a bluff, but a real fact, which we should all be worried about. The arms race began two years ago. The facts are what we have heard and seen. In the winter of 1932, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria, establishing the puppet state of Manchukuo under Japanese protection. This move by Japan not only violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but also destroyed a major cornerstone of the Washington Naval Treaty. At the Washington Conference in 1922, because Japan agreed to respect China's territorial integrity and no longer invade China, the United States also agreed to limit the U.S. Navy to not being able to operate in the western Pacific as an exchange condition. Unexpectedly, ten years later, Japan broke its promise and immediately increased its military strength. Therefore, Japan's ambitions are no longer restricted by treaties. What can limit Japan's ambitions are only Japan's resources and its ability to compete in the arms race. This is very clear.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Germany's Militarism <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>In Western Europe, the arms race was triggered by the revolution of the National Socialist Party of Germany. After Hitler came to power, Germany's spiritual rearmament can be said to have been completed. Therefore, all discussions on material disarmament in Geneva were just a formality and were not practical. Everyone knows that the National Socialist Party harbors militarism. Even if the Disarmament Conference were to conclude a disarmament treaty, it would only be a diplomatic formality and would not be enough to achieve the reality of peace.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Misunderstandings of the British and Americans <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The American people often misunderstand the reality of the disarmament issue, as do the British people. The most popular argument among the British and American people is that if countries agree to reduce armaments, the disputes between countries will not become serious, and peace will be established. This is putting the cart before the horse. In 1922, the United States could have built a navy that surpassed Britain, but because Britain agreed to abolish the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the United States also agreed to keep its navy on par with Britain. At that time, the reason why we agreed with Japan on the 5:5:3 naval ratio was that we firmly believed that disarmament was the path to peace, so the United States was willing to give up its naval superiority.</p>
<p>The reason why we allow naval armaments to be equal to Britain is that war is equivalent to the suicide of both countries. The United States knows this, and Britain knows this. Since the two countries have this understanding with each other, there is no need to engage in mutual competition in armaments. In short, the United States' naval policy is based on an assessment of the international situation at the time, not on a simple idea that all countries can disarm and want to disarm to avoid war.</p>
<h3 id="e32">France Maintains Treaties <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>As for land armaments in Europe, the United States has a different view. The United States requires Europe to reduce armaments first and then resolve the various serious disputes in Europe. However, France has always known that the Treaty of Versailles can only be maintained by force. Now it must deal with Hitler of Germany. Who is Hitler? It means Germany's rearmament and efforts to overthrow the Treaty of Versailles. Under these circumstances, advocating disarmament to Europe is not only ineffective but also dangerous. Although, we should not think that there is no hope for the future, and we should not think that the arms race will inevitably lead to war as a natural conclusion. In short, the way to preserve peace is to solve practical problems, not to avoid practical problems and only seek piecemeal solutions to superficial phenomena such as cannons, tanks, and warships. This is what we advocate.</p>

<p>In Europe, we are currently doing nothing, but in the Far East, we can still do something, and it is related to our survival. Although the United States has suffered the pain of diplomatic failure in the Manchurian Incident, it should continue to explore the situation and engage in calm diplomatic action with Japan, Russia, China, Britain, and France to find out whether the Far East problem can still be resolved. In short, if there is an opportunity, we should work together to seize it and not let it slip away. If not, the future will be very bleak, and the arms race between countries will only become more and more intense. (25th Dispatch from Havas)</p>

<p>And Convenes Division Commander Conference</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The second military system reform plan completed during the Nan Lu Shi era was indefinitely postponed due to the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident. However, due to the development of the incident and the changes in the international environment, it is keenly felt that emergency measures are necessary for the departments at that time. The various departments regarding military strength, organization, and system will begin to reform in the future to adapt to the new international situation. With regard to the joint defense of "Manchukuo" and its surrounding environment, not only are some reforms necessary in the formation and equipment of the Kwantung Army, but reforms are also necessary in all departments of the entire army to adapt to the new era. Therefore, the Ministry of the Army will decide to study and reform the military system in April to establish long-term facilities. The main points of the research work will focus on improving equipment and modernizing the army. (26th Dispatch from the Electric Communication)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Division Commander Conference is scheduled to be held on the 27th. It is reported that the conference will also exchange views on the issue of military intervention in politics. The Army Minister's instructions specifically warn against touching on this case. First, the opinions of the army commanders and division commanders will be solicited, and then the views of the army headquarters will be stated. It is reported that the division commanders who came to Tokyo to attend the meeting this time also went to the palace on the 26th to pay respects to His Majesty the Emperor, and each reported on the military situation under their jurisdiction. (26th Dispatch from the Japan Union)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi, because the parliament has ended, will propose policy issues from the standpoint of a state minister, that is, he intends to investigate and study various issues related to national defense. The various policy issues proposed by former Army Minister Araki have also been generally recorded and compiled. Also, the investigations ordered by Army Minister Hayashi from related agencies within the department at the beginning of his tenure have also been generally completed. At the Division Commander Conference on the 27th, he will also listen to the demands of the division commanders for local conditions related to national defense. Therefore, the Army Minister's research on various policies related to national defense will proceed quite quickly. However, Army Minister Hayashi takes a cautious attitude towards this issue. Since he has a proper understanding of the current situation, he will definitely propose proposals without any ambiguity. Because the Army Minister has this determination, after the research is completed, he will order the central and local agencies to investigate and study, so the time when his policies are realized in the cabinet and proposed to the relevant cabinet members will be around the end of May at the earliest.

<p>(Tokyo) The tumultuous 65th session of parliament ended at 11:40 p.m. on the 25th. The government submitted a total of 214.2 million yuan in the budget proposal for the Showa 9th year to this parliament, and the original proposal was passed by the parliament in its entirety. Also, out of the 50 bills submitted by the government, 48 will be passed by the parliament. Although the current government has passed the difficult hurdle of its second general election, it has suffered from internal affairs problems and other trivial incidents, which led to the dismissal of Minister Nakajima and Minister Hatoyama. It is now in a state of being covered in wounds. The major mission of the current cabinet is to stabilize public sentiment, revise the election law, enrich national defense, and other matters. Having already achieved its goals in parliament, rumors are spreading that Saito will soon resign and refresh the public sentiment. Therefore, the political situation after the adjournment of this parliament is quite noteworthy. (26th Dispatch from the Japan Union)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The closing ceremony of the Japanese parliament was held in the House of Peers at 11:00 a.m. today. The Emperor was not present today, but Prime Minister Saito and all the cabinet members and all the members of both houses attended the court in formal attire. After saluting the throne, the cabinet secretary presented the Emperor's edict and handed it over to the Prime Minister for reading. The ceremony was then completed.

<p>(Tokyo) Out of the 50 bills submitted by the government to the parliament, the bills that were not passed were the Amendment to the Public Order Maintenance Law and the Publications Deposit Law.

<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito issued a statement after the parliament ended, saying that the next year's budget, in view of the current international situation, is mainly for national defense expenses. Japan's national defense has been stabilized by this, which is truly commendable. Among the government proposals, important laws such as the election amendment have all been passed by the parliament. In the coming years, there will be many events both domestically and internationally. It is most important for the entire nation to unite and do their best in their respective positions.

<p>Rome According to today's published statistics, the number of votes cast in this election was approximately 96 and a quarter percent of the total electorate. A total of 10,042,000 people voted in favor of the government list, and 15,265 people voted against it. (26th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome Today is the date of the House of Representatives election. Everything went very smoothly. According to current statistics, about 90 percent of the voters cast their votes, numbering over 10 million. Prime Minister Mussolini was the first person to vote. The exact number of votes has not yet been counted, but it is expected that the voters will write the word "Yes" on the ballot. Yesterday, many Italian soldiers who were injured in the war were pushed to the ballot box in wheelchairs. Many soldiers went to the polling place to fill out the list, which was a special feature of yesterday's election. There are 400 people who were selected from the candidates recommended by the Italian industrial, social, and cultural groups at the Fascist Congress. It is generally believed that Mussolini has expressed dissatisfaction with the House of Representatives, so this House of Representatives is probably the last parliament in Italy. Since the announcement of the law on May 17, 1928, the electoral system has undergone major changes. All men who are 21 years of age or older, or married men who are 18 years of age or older, or widowers with children, who pay taxes of 100 lira or more per year, or receive salaries or subsidies from public organizations, have the right to vote. The House of Representatives has 400 members with a term of five years. All those who are 25 years of age or older and meet certain conditions have the right to be elected. In 1929, the number of voters accounted for 89.5 percent of the national electorate, and about 98.3 percent approved the list of candidates recommended by the state. (25th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome The general election of the House of Representatives, held on a Sunday holiday, has been completed, and the order was quite orderly. 214,461 voters in Rome voted in 234 districts. The number of participants accounted for 81 to 90 percent of the total number of voters. Youth corps members of the Pan-Fascist Party guarded the entrance of each polling place. Members of the Pan-Fascist Party, on the other hand, paraded through the streets on trucks decorated with national flags, singing national anthems, and holding many small flags with words written on them, expressing their loyalty to the current system. Various ships anchored in the Port of Rome flew flags to celebrate. The election results will be clear tonight. (25th Dispatch from Havas)</p>

<p>Labor-Management Agreement Established</p>

<p>(Washington) National Recovery Administration head Johnson made more optimistic remarks tonight, saying that although negotiations for the automobile industry dispute still face difficulties, they are largely ready, and he is confident that the labor strike can be quickly resolved. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The resolution of the automobile industry dispute stipulates that workers have absolute freedom of collective bargaining, and they have the right to elect to be members of the company's union or a union affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. Federation of Labor President Green stated that workers have been guaranteed the right to organize themselves, engage in collective bargaining, and have the representatives they choose represent them. The President hopes that this agreement will lead to the creation of a factory administrative council, where workers can hold joint meetings with employers, creating a more equal relationship between labor and management. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued a statement today, announcing the resolution of the automobile industry dispute, saying that "we have created a new path for the structure of American society." The key points of the new method are that a three-person administrative council will be established in Detroit within 24 hours, consisting of representatives from labor, management, and a neutral party, under the supervision of the National Recovery Administration. This council has the power to make final and binding judgments on issues such as dismissed workers and discrimination against workers, and can inspect various payrolls and lists of worker representatives. Union payrolls do not need to be submitted to the factory management, but failure to submit them will disqualify discrimination cases from being investigated. Currently, the labor side has appointed automobile industry employee Mr. Elder to participate as a representative of the council. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The American automobile workers' strike, which has affected the entire country for the past three weeks, is now a thing of the past. At 7:45 p.m. this afternoon, the White House announced that the automobile industry labor strike has been resolved, which is generally considered satisfactory. Union leaders are not as optimistic about the terms of the agreement as the management side, as can be seen in their response to the President's initial declaration. According to the White House, this agreement is purely a compromise between labor and management. In this agreement, the President will appoint an arbitration committee composed of three members, with labor and management each having one member, and the other member being an outsider. The committee's task is to resolve various disputes that may arise in the future due to unfair treatment of worker representatives and the dismissal of workers. Union leaders had also requested to convene a workers' meeting and elect official representatives to negotiate with management, but this request has now been dashed.

<p>According to the terms of this agreement, workers have achieved one of their main goals, namely, complying with the National Industrial Recovery Act. However, the concession that management will make on this point is only a guarantee to implement the item that workers can elect their own representatives. According to President Roosevelt, the resolution of this labor strike is actually a preliminary step in improving the relationship between labor and management in the future. The President further stated that the government has no intention of favoring any union or any worker organization in this matter. The National Automobile Chamber of Commerce issued a statement expressing workers' gratitude to the President and General Johnson for their mediation, stating that the President and General Johnson were able to take into account the principles we trust and resolve this dispute. President Roosevelt convened several meetings, often lasting until late at night, even on Saturdays and Sundays, to discuss this matter, and the announcement made by the White House today is the final result of many discussions in the White House. This morning, National Recovery Administration Administrator General Johnson and Detroit automobile industry worker representatives Green and Turin held a long meeting. After the meeting, the three went to the White House together and discussed with President Roosevelt for another three hours. Then General Johnson visited the Automobile Industry Administrative Committee, and shortly thereafter, the White House announced the resolution of the labor strike. It is said that labor and management only agreed to this agreement in the final few minutes, and the President's announcement was like a red sun in a dark cloud. (National Press Agency, 25th)</p>

<p>Using Red Scare to Incite Public Opinion</p>
<p>Congress to Conduct Formal Investigation</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's political enemies seem to have decided to use the so-called "red threat" to oppose the President. They firmly believe that the best way to make American public opinion lose its composure and judgment is to incite it. Some newspapers even claim that a communist conspiracy will erupt in May, exaggerating the situation. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is rumored that there is a plan to overthrow the existing American government social system and replace it with a communist system, placing President Roosevelt in the position of Kerensky (the revolutionary leader who overthrew the Russian monarchy). Political circles are shocked by this rumor. Congress is quite angry, and the House of Representatives will soon move to formally investigate this matter. It is reported that this claim was made by Professor White, a well-known American educator, who claims to have heard it from President Roosevelt's advisors. As for who the informant is, Professor White refuses to reveal. Members of Congress have denounced this as absurd and ridiculous, but political circles are still greatly alarmed. The general opinion in the House of Representatives is that no one would dare to say this, while the Senate is skeptical and advocates that Professor White should reveal the name of the informant. The House of Representatives will discuss a bill this week to investigate the actions of President Roosevelt's advisors, the so-called "brain trust." (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e45">American Silver Problem <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Reconciling Opinions from All Sides</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Senator Smith stated that the Senate Agriculture and Forestry Committee will discuss the Davis Silver Bill on Tuesday. At the same time, Senator King plans to consult with the President on various opinions regarding silver legislation and draft a silver plan that can gain majority support in Congress. According to King, chairman of the Special Silver Committee, the Special Silver Committee is composed of twenty-four senators. According to Davis, the proposer of the Davis Silver Bill, who told the Associated Press today that he asked the Senate to send the bill to the Agriculture and Forestry Committee for review, which is a major victory for the bill, because it can not only arouse the Senate's interest in silver, but also gain the support of the Senate's agricultural sector. According to Senator Smith, the Davis Silver Bill still needs considerable discussion. The Senate also intends to take similar actions on other silver plans in order to reconcile the opinions of various factions in the Senate on silver, in order to obtain a silver plan that can be accepted by the entire Senate. Smith continued, the country is currently in need of more currency, which is indeed a good opportunity for the Senate to take action on silver. As for the Silver Steering Committee designated by the Silver Group of twenty-four senators yesterday, Chairman King gave a multi-faceted explanation of the significance of the committee today. According to King, the main purpose of the committee is to arouse Congress's early announcement of silver legislation. In addition, the supporters of silver in the Senate today planned to formulate important silver legislation in this session. The special meeting on the silver issue convened yesterday by Senator Wheeler and Senator King was attended by a surprisingly large number of people. Observers believe that this move is a sign of the formulation of silver legislation in this session of Congress. All we do not know is what kind of legislation can obtain the support and acceptance of silver advocates. According to the prediction of the host of yesterday's special silver meeting, seventeen people could attend the meeting, but as a result, as many as twenty-four people reported to the meeting, and most of the participants guaranteed that they would fight for silver and participate in attacking the opponents of the silver bill. The Special Steering Committee led by King has been entrusted by the entire meeting to consult with the outside world. It is said that the first step of the committee led by King will be to consult with the Senate Committee on Weights and Measures on the points of approval and early maturity of the silver plan. As for the Davis Silver Bill, it is still under consideration by the Committee on Weights and Measures, and there will be seven members who will be designated tomorrow. Its special meeting will continue to discuss the future steps of silver after the designation of the King Committee, and require legislation to use silver as currency (that is, to stipulate the ratio of gold and silver in law to enable the United States to implement the gold and silver bimetallic standard). According to Senator Hulo, they will draft another appendix to Davis's silver bill, the content of which will be similar to the content of the silver purchase bill appendix.

<p>(Washington) According to opinions in political circles here, now that Japan's foreign trade rate is increasing day by day, there are almost no traces of Japanese goods everywhere in the world. The influence of the yen in the world's finances cannot be hidden. Therefore, if we want to transform the world's finances and consolidate it in the future, it seems that we cannot ignore Japan. In the past, the great power of the world's finances was almost entirely controlled by the three major powers, namely France, Britain, and the United States. In the future, it seems that Japan should be allowed to join to become a group of four major powers. Recently, the President of the Dutch Famous International Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Fitalik, and the US Treasury Secretary and Secretary of Commerce once discussed this issue.

<p>Shao Yuanchong: Three Recent Meetings</p>
<p>Dai Chuanxian: The Significance of Going to the Northwest</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 122nd Memorial Week at 9:00 am on the 26th. More than 400 people attended, including Ye Chucang, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, Deng Jiayan, Li Zonghuang, Zheng Zhannan, and all staff members. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting. Shao Yuanchong reported that, in order to promote propaganda work, the Central Propaganda Committee recently convened three types of meetings in succession: literature and art, news, and film, in order to obtain a complete standard and policy for propaganda work. Regarding the literary and artistic meetings, because left-wing literature and art are currently popular in society, creating a decadent and romantic atmosphere, it is urgent to correct this. There are concrete discussions in this regard, and it is established that the Three Principles of the People will be the theoretical center of literary and artistic propaganda, nationalism will be the current policy of literary and artistic propaganda, and the content of literary and artistic propaganda works, etc. Regarding the news aspect, it stipulates the liaison of news, etc., and the communication policy, revises the Publishing Law, and decides on the method of severely cracking down on unscrupulous tabloids and newspapers that specialize in revealing social pathologies and corrupt events. Regarding the film aspect, the review authority of films has been unified and reorganized into the Film Inspection Committee. In the future, the copies will be reviewed before the companies make them, so as to avoid losses after the film is made, and to give the companies more convenience and reduce their difficulties and obstacles. Since convening three kinds of meetings, I feel that propaganda work is even more valuable, and it is especially necessary to concentrate our efforts. I hope that all comrades in the Central Committee and responsible comrades of party affairs in all parts of the country will contribute their time and ability to help, and the effectiveness of propaganda work can be seen immediately. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its Memorial Week at 9:00 am on the 26th. More than 300 people attended, including Lin Sen, Dai Chuanxian, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Gongbo, Chen Shaokuan, Zhu Peide, Chen Shuren, Huang Fusheng, Lin Xiang, Wang Yongbin, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, Cao Sen, Deng Jiayan, and officials from various hospitals and departments. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Dai Chuanxian reported on the significance of going to the Northwest for inspection, stating that the importance of the Northwest problem has gradually been recognized by the people of the country. This time, I went to the Northwest with Committee Member Song to inspect Shaanxi first, because Shaanxi is the famous Hanzhong area in history. The land is fertile and the deposits are abundant. Due to the drought years ago, the people of the province were displaced, and the tragic situation of death was too numerous to write down. The biggest cause of the drought is the failure to use water for irrigation. The amount of water in Shaanxi Province is not lacking. If water conservancy can be rectified, agricultural development will be very easy and drought can be avoided. Since the government has a plan to develop the Northwest, I plan to go to Shaanxi for inspection to prepare for the development. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian led reporters to the Northwest inspection site on the morning of the 26th, planning to go to Xi'an first. If there is enough time, or to go to Gansu and Qinghai.

If preparations are not adequate, it may be postponed for several days. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo talked about four things: 1. Director of the Mining Department Huang Jintao went to the United States to hire American mechanical experts to estimate the steel plant machinery contract. The Xiwang Company borrowed money to purchase machinery. It took years of planning but failed to decide. Recently, the price difference between China and Germany was huge, so Huang was sent to the United States to ask experts for a public assessment, and it will be launched early next month. It is not going to the United States for inspection. 2. Yu went to Nanyang for inspection and is preparing his luggage. The travel date has not yet been decided. 3. The Central Machinery Factory was built with Geng money. The site in Caoxie Gorge is low-lying, and the cost of filling the base is about 190,000 yuan, which is not cost-effective. Now another site on the north bank of the Suzhou River in Shanghai has been designated as the construction site of the factory. 4. The Executive Yuan approved the allocation of 4.1 million yuan from this department to establish a newspaper factory. The plan has been sent to the Sino-British Geng Fund for review.

It goes without saying that the constables are on the train to maintain order. If there is such a situation, it is not a small matter for both the constables' reputation and the road service. You should send a letter to your headquarters, transfer the escort constables of the Beijing-Shanghai-Tianjin-Pukou-Beijing-Nanjing routes, pay attention to correction, maintain order, and ensure travel safety.

<p>Public Security Bureau official beaten half to death while delivering orders</p>
<p>Workers underground nearly starve as mine entrances are surrounded</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Currently, only over three hundred coal miners at the Kailuan Tangshan mine are still insisting on not resuming work until the mine authorities fully accept their conditions. The authorities dare not pressure these three hundred-odd people because they have some backing from a certain party. The conditions they have put forward are under discussion. The striking workers convened a workers' congress on the 25th, but not many people attended, so a planned demonstration did not materialize. The striking workers issued slogans claiming that a stray bullet from police gunfire injured a rickshaw puller, hoping to get rickshaw pullers to jointly strike and expand the scale of the strike. On the evening of the 25th, an official from the Tangshan Public Security Bureau was ordered to deliver orders to the labor union and was dragged outside by the workers and beaten half to death. The detained secret service agent of the Public Security Bureau has not yet been released. Some in-shift workers who did not participate in the strike went underground to work. The striking workers, angry at their undermining of the strike group, surrounded the mine entrances, preventing anyone from sending food down the well. The underground workers, without food, stopped working and came out of the mine. On the evening of the 25th, Tao Shangming, the head of the Public Security Bureau, Zhao Xun, still invited workers to discuss the conditions. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Motives Behind the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian Economic Alliance</p>
<p>Many Thorns Still Lie Ahead for the Future of the Disarmament Issue</p>
<p>The uneasy atmosphere in Europe has made Europeans wary, fearing that a slight incident will trigger a disaster like that of 1914. Of course, we can still believe that although there are many current evils, a war will not break out immediately. There are many problems, and they are extremely serious. Taking France as an example, peaceful Paris has successively experienced riots that have only been seen since the Great Revolution. General social order is almost unsustainable. The cause originated from the market price issue in a small city in the southern region near Spain. As for involving the cabinet and many congressmen, although this is an ugly event that has been seen in French history, it is enough to prove the social unrest in Europe, especially the dark side of the relatively stable society of France, and the public's dissatisfaction with parliamentary politics.</p>
<p>During the same period that France was busy quelling internal disputes, the Austrian government and the Social Democratic Party also had very fierce street battles, with casualties exceeding one thousand. Moreover, the street battles in Vienna, this ancient city, are not like the protests of the citizens of Paris who are simply dissatisfied with internal affairs, merely exposing the ugliness of parliament. It is more than that. It contains very serious international problems, and of course also the contradictions of Austria itself. The international problem is the triangular opposition of Germany, France, and Italy. Germany wants to annex Austria, France is only consolidating its hegemony in Europe, and Italy has another idea, wanting to take advantage of the opposition between Germany and France to establish an economic alliance centered on Italy to confront Germany and France.</p>
<p>Of the 6.73 million people in Austria, 6.05 million are Austrian people of the German race. In Europe, in this fog garden where national consciousness is evident and national boundaries are strict, Austria has no economic outlet. France, insisting on the sanctity of treaties, is unwilling to provide Austria with economic assistance. In 1931, the German Foreign Minister Curtius and the Austrian Foreign Minister Schober signed the German-Austrian Customs Agreement. Although it was suppressed by the League of Nations, it was always the first smoke screen set for German-Austrian unification. On the one hand, France used the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Saint-Germain as weapons to oppose this matter. On the other hand, the Czech Republic and Yugoslavia in particular fear that once Germany and Austria merge, the minority problem will inevitably become more fiercely contested. Even Italy fears that its 250,000 German-speaking people in South Tyrol will also be incited by the German National Socialist Party, causing serious disputes. Therefore, the Black Shirt Prime Minister sent his Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich to Budapest, the capital of Hungary, to visit Gömbös, and on February 24, he went from Budapest to Vienna to visit Prime Minister Dollfuss, who was clad in iron, to discuss the issue of how to form an economic alliance between Italy, Austria, and Hungary. It is said that in addition to striving to guarantee the independence of Austria and Hungary, Italy also suggested that Trieste and Fiume be used as maritime passages for Austria and Hungary, but on the condition that it opposes the National Socialist Party and maintains Austrian independence. Of course, maintaining Austrian independence has two meanings: one is not to merge with Germany, and the other is to stay away from France. This is naturally what Austria and Hungary are praying for. Originally, Austria was suffering from the competition of socialists, National Socialists, and fascists, to the point of not knowing what to do. France has to take into account the relationship of the Little Entente. In fact, the Little Entente countries now also have some discord with France, so Austria cannot seek help from France, nor can it accommodate Germany, so it has no choice but to listen to Italy's leadership.</p>
<p>However, after Austria and Hungary listen to Italy's orders, the political situation in Central Europe will become even more complicated. Germany, France, the Little Entente, Italy, Poland, and even the Soviet Union will be involved in certain places and at certain times. Of course, the United Kingdom cannot stand by either.</p>
<p>British Lord Privy Seal Eden visited France specifically after the formation of the Doumergue cabinet. The important issue to be discussed was to revive the disarmament conference, which had already become a zombie. In particular, he wanted to mediate the opposition between France and Germany. He successively exchanged opinions with Prime Minister Doumergue and other cabinet members, so that the friendly relations between Britain and France would continue for a long time. He visited German Chancellor Hitler on February 20 and President Hindenburg on the 22nd, also to discuss the disarmament issue. They only talked about how to be friendly and how to seek a consensus on disarmament opinions, but how to coordinate with France was not agreed upon. Eden went to Rome again on February 24 to visit Mussolini. Of course, there would be no huge differences between Britain and Italy, and there was more optimistic talk. Eden will leave Rome tomorrow to return to Paris to exchange views with the French authorities and then talk about how to resolve the disarmament issue.</p>
<p>However, another center of gravity has formed in Rome. If the economic alliance between Italy, Austria, and Hungary is really established, even if France can barely maintain its dominant diplomacy, it will be different from before. Austria and Hungary are united as a group, and the Little Entente countries will have to deal with it perfunctorily. As a result, France's opponents increase, diplomacy becomes more difficult, and the shock in Europe becomes even more severe. (February 26, 1934)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Song Ziwen Releases Details on the Cotton and Wheat Loan <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>丨Report to the Economic Conference丨</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council, recently released a report on the details of the US cotton and wheat loan and its implementation: "Last April, when Ziwen was ordered to attend the Washington Economic Discussion Conference, the Central Government, based on the Premier's industrial plan, instructed him to seize the opportunity to negotiate international investment. During the trip to the United States, he received a telegram instructing him on the principles and methods, and authorized him to handle the matter as the opportunity arose. Ziwen modestly acknowledged the instructions, and only hoped to exert his meager abilities to work diligently within the scope of not harming sovereignty, benefiting national finances, and being conducive to construction projects, so as not to fail in his mission.</p>
<p>After arriving in Washington, he proceeded to discuss with the US authorities based on this principle. However, the US government has no right to directly lend to the governments of other countries, and can only allow the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation to come forward to transfer the loan. According to the limitations of its organization, the company's loans to foreign countries are limited to agricultural products. The only agricultural products that are shipped to China in large quantities are cotton and wheat. According to China's customs reports, the number of US cotton and wheat imported over the years is very large.</p>
<p>During the negotiation period, he received a telegram from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry stating that cotton prices in Shanghai were soaring, and raw materials were only borrowed for six weeks. Cotton mills were in a panic, so please discuss with the US to ship cotton to China as soon as possible. He also received a telegram from President Kong of the Central Bank stating that Rong Zongjing came to say that lending 600,000 bales of US cotton for resale to manufacturers to obtain funds to be used to help the rural areas and promote the cotton-growing areas will increase cotton production by 5 million dan per year, increasing farmers' income by 200 million yuan. The settlement price and interest will be handled in accordance with the wheat loan method, shipping 50,000 bales per month, completing the shipment in one year, including 420,000 bales of "7/8 inch," 120,000 bales of "15/16 inch," and 60,000 bales of "1 1/32 inch." If this can be done, it will be of great benefit to the finances. He hoped to proceed immediately. Subsequently, he received a telegram from Vice Minister Zou of the Ministry of Finance stating that President Wang wrote in a letter that the cotton textile mills in our country are becoming increasingly precarious. The biggest reason is that the domestic raw cotton is insufficient and its price is rising day by day, while the price of the produced products is falling due to the dumping of foreign goods. The way to save the situation is to ask the government to borrow money from the US government to purchase 600,000 bales of US cotton for resale to Chinese merchants' yarn mills, and use the money to help the rural areas, promote cotton-growing areas, and improve quality. After the matter was brought up for discussion in the Yuan, Chen Gongbo believed that it was beneficial and should be adopted, and was unanimously approved. Minister Song also had this idea, and instructed that the main points of the note and the opinion of the Yuan should be telegraphed to Junzuo immediately, requesting that negotiations be conducted with the US government to ensure success. The main points are: 1. The government should borrow 600,000 bales of US cotton from the US government. The settlement price and shipping method are the same as the US wheat loan. 2. 50,000 bales will be shipped from the US to China each month, and the shipment will be completed in twelve months. 3. This cotton includes 420,000 bales of 7/8-inch cotton, 120,000 bales of 15/16-inch cotton, and 60,000 bales of /38-inch cotton. 4. The interest is the same as US wheat. Subsequently, he received a telegram from Vice Minister Zou stating that the yarn mills only had enough cotton for one month, and requested that the foreign cotton tariff be waived for six months to purchase goods from the US and India; otherwise, they would stop work on July 1. Wu Tiecheng convened a meeting of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the banking community. The position of Minister Zou was that Rong Zongjing requested to borrow US cotton, and Junzuo was already proceeding with it, and it was possible to get relief; otherwise, we would discuss it later. Please telegraph the situation of the cotton shortage quickly. If it is difficult to achieve success temporarily, we will find other ways to provide relief, and so on. Ziwen repeatedly thought and considered that the existing industries in our country were already few and far between. Now the situation of the yarn mills is at a critical moment. At this time when the national situation is in danger, all industries are declining, the finances are exhausted, and the whole country is in panic, if even these yarn mills cannot be maintained, it will inevitably affect domestic finance. Then the so-called international economic cooperation and the hope of jointly developing China's industries are equal to nothing. Therefore, based on the instructions of the Central Government, the letters and telegrams of President Wang, Minister Chen, and President Kong, and the request of the factories, he made every effort to carry out the above-mentioned loan and promote its success. As for the quantity of cotton and wheat loans, it was based on the above-mentioned telegrams, with the national Chinese factories able to sell 600,000 bales per year as the standard. Therefore, the loan for the US cotton portion was 40 million US dollars (which can purchase more than 600,000 bales according to current market prices), while the US wheat and flour portion was only 10 million US dollars, which also far exceeded the above-mentioned borrowed amount according to the import statistics over the years.</p>
<p>As for the sales situation, according to the brief report of Xi Demao, manager of the US Loan Cotton and Wheat Affairs Office of the Central Bank: 1. The wheat loan of 6 million US dollars is about to be sold out, but the flour is still difficult due to market price relations. 2. Due to various reasons, only 10 million US dollars of cotton can be sold in this session. Therefore, the contract was revised with the United States as follows (the original contract has been published in various newspapers every year): (1) Under the item of the US wheat loan amount, 6 million US dollars, the term is extended from March 1 of this year to July 31 of the same year. (2) Under the item of the US flour loan amount, 4 million US dollars, the term is extended from March 1 of this year to December 31 of the same year. (3) Under the item of the US cotton loan amount, the amount is reduced from 40 million US dollars to 10 million US dollars. As for the US flour item, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has the right to cancel it, but it must notify in advance. However, for the reduced portion of the US cotton loan amount, he worked hard to negotiate with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to change it to purchase US wheat or other construction materials, but the company did not accept this proposal. Based on the above situation, the estimated revenue for this year is approximately 16 million yuan in national currency for the US wheat item, 5 million yuan for the US flour item, and 22.5 million yuan for the US cotton item, with a total net income of approximately 43.5 million yuan, which can be used for construction. This report is respectfully submitted for your consideration." Attached is the estimated revenue report from the manager of the US Loan Cotton and Wheat Affairs Office: "Respectfully submit the current revenue and expenditure status of the US loan cotton and wheat loan and the estimated total revenue in the future, divided into the following:</p>
<p>(1) After the loan contract is revised, the cotton and wheat loan amount should be changed as follows:</p>
<p>US Cotton US$10 million</p>
<p>US Wheat US$6 million</p>
<p>US Flour US$4 million</p>
<p>Total US$20 million</p>
<p>If the above loan amount can be used up completely, in addition to the principal amount for the first year, the total revenue will be approximately 48 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>(2) Current revenue and expenditure status: As of today, the price of all cotton and wheat that has been sold under the loan item and the accounts receivable for the sold cotton and wheat:</p>
<p>Revenue:</p>
<p>US Cotton 7.5 million yuan in national currency</p>
<p>US Wheat and Flour 19 million yuan in national currency</p>
<p>Expenditure:</p>
<p>Freight and handling fees, etc., approximately 3 million yuan in national currency</p>
<p>After offsetting revenue and expenditure, the remaining amount is 23.5 million yuan in national currency</p>
<p>(3) Estimated total revenue in the future: The sales of cotton and wheat are all handled according to market prices and have not suffered losses.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned total amount of 23.5 million yuan in national currency for the goods of the cotton and wheat that have already been sold, the revenue from the US cotton, US wheat, and US flour that have not been purchased and transported should be budgeted as follows:</p>
<p>1. US Cotton: As of today, a total of approximately 50,000 bales have been sold. If we consider the sales situation over the past six months, it will take approximately one year to complete the sales of the remaining US cotton. However, because the market inventory has not been abundant recently, there may be hope for a complete wholesale sale by the summer of this year.</p>
<p>Based on the estimated market price, the revenue from the sales of the remaining US cotton, in addition to the 7.5 million yuan in national currency that has already been received, is estimated to be approximately 15 million yuan in national currency based on the current exchange rate. 2. US Wheat: The total loan amount is 6 million US dollars, which can purchase approximately 320,000 short tons of US wheat. Assuming an average of 4 yuan per dan, and 60 yuan per ton, the revenue from 320,000 short tons of US wheat is approximately 19 million yuan. After deducting approximately 3 million yuan for freight, the net revenue from the sales of US wheat is approximately 16 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>3. US Flour: As of today, only 300 tons have been sold. The reason is that the office does not want to compete with domestic flour in the current domestic market with US flour, and the US authorities cannot agree with the world price. However, if the market needs it in the future and the price is suitable, we can purchase and sell it as much as possible. Then the estimated US flour item can have a surplus of 5 million to 10 million yuan in national currency. According to the above calculations, by the end of the year, it is estimated that there will be a net revenue of 22.5 million yuan in national currency from US cotton, 16 million yuan in national currency from US wheat, and 5 million to 10 million yuan in national currency from US flour, for a total of approximately 43.5 million to 48.5 million yuan in national currency. Xi Demao respectfully submits this report, March 24, 23rd year."</p>
<h3 id="e86">Second Installment of Victory Reports from the Sichuan Bandit Suppression Army <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Cables Chiang Kai-shek Reporting on Victorious Situation</p>
<p>Dispatching 50,000 Rounds of Bullets to Encourage Troops</p>
<p>Chengdu Dispatch: The Sichuan bandit suppression campaign has progressed rapidly since the second general offensive order was issued. One route, Deng's troops, captured the key towns of Wanghanba and Mumen. The second route, Tian's troops, captured the key towns of Duan'echang and Xinchang. The fourth route troops captured the key towns of Xiangtanzi. The fifth route army faced the main bandit force. On the left flank, Fan Shaozeng engaged in fierce battles with Xu bandits' troops around Shilong and Shie'e, killing over three thousand bandits. On the right flank, Yang Qiwen, Liao Zhen, Chen Houkun, and other units cleared the right bank of the Zhong River and are now joining forces with Tang Shizun and Xu Shaozong's divisions to encircle the pseudo-30th Army and pseudo-9th Army units at Luowenba. Yang Qin'an's independent regiment has already occupied the front of Jigongzui. The third route, Li's troops, have made even faster progress. After capturing Yanghe, the gateway to Bazhong, on the 14th, they advanced to the vicinity of Bazhong city. On the night of the 18th, they launched a surprise attack on Bazhong city. At that time, there were still over five thousand bandits in Bazhong. Li and Luo's troops encircled the city from the left and right. Three aircraft dispatched by the headquarters dropped bombs from the sky to assist in the battle, killing up to four thousand bandits. Few escaped. This occurred between the 18th and 19th. Liu Xiang, recognizing Luo's troops' efforts in suppressing bandits and their repeated meritorious deeds, not only issued a clear commendation order but also instructed the military department to allocate an additional 50,000 rounds of ammunition to encourage them. Yesterday, he telegraphed Nanchang to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, reporting on the gradual progress of each route of the bandit suppression army, the shrinking of the bandit areas, and the joint attack on Tongnan. The original telegram reads as follows: "Respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of Nanchang: Since the issuance of the second phase of the Sichuan bandit suppression plan, various routes have engaged in numerous fierce battles and made steady progress. According to comprehensive intelligence from all sources, bandit leaders Xu Xiangqian, Chen Changhao, Zhang Guotao, and others have repeatedly held meetings, still intending to concentrate their main force to break through Xiadong, connect with He bandits, blockade the Yangtze River, and disturb Sichuan and Hubei. Evidenced by the rapid progress of the left flank and the fierce battles of the fifth route, their intentions and actions are clearly visible. Fortunately, the core troops of the bandits have already been dispersed among various units. The result of arbitrary slaughter has led to a loss of popular support. For a year, the manpower of Tongnanba has been exhausted. Therefore, incidents of responding to the government army and surrendering with weapons are heard daily. The people in the rear have saved on clothing and food to help, and the people close to the bandit areas have also transported supplies for us. Therefore, although after months of continuous fighting, morale remains as strong as ever. Recent offensives have been hampered by high mountains and dangerous roads, preventing significant progress. Our Deng's troops captured Puzi Ridge, Tian's troops captured Yinjiapu and Zhanggong Bridge, Luo's troops captured Enyang River on a cold day, and Qiao Wan recovered Bazhong. Li's troops captured Parrot Mountain, Yang's troops captured Lancao Ferry, Fan's troops captured Longfengchang, and Tang's troops captured Guandu Factory Stream. We are now ordering all units to continue the offensive along the entire line, setting a deadline to recover Tongjiang. Thanks to your virtue and the loyalty and bravery of the officers and soldiers, the bandit areas are gradually shrinking, and the time for encirclement and annihilation is not far off. Knowing of your concern, I hereby report. I humbly request that you issue instructions from time to time so that we may follow them. Respectfully, Liu Xiang, bowing and sealing."

<h3 id="e89">Special Dispatch from London <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, March 26: The British Financial News reports that the U.S. Treasury Department's refusal to allow domestic bankers to participate in French loans is of great importance, as it reveals the policy the U.S. authorities will adopt in the future. The war debt issue remains unresolved, preventing many borrowers from operating in the U.S. market. This situation is tantamount to the U.S. not being prepared to lend its export surplus to other countries, which will result in a continuous inflow of gold into the U.S., and European exchange rates will be under constant unfavorable pressure, which could endanger the stability of currencies at any time. Under these circumstances, attempting to stabilize the current inconvertible currencies would be a dangerous move.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, March 26: Professor Gregory, on behalf of the International Chamber of Commerce, stated in a memorandum that the decline in exchange rates is a tightening factor in world trade, rather than an inflationary factor as generally expected. There is no need to say that stabilizing currency prices will result in lower prices, nor is it necessary to say that the recovery of international lending depends on the stability of currencies. Experience shows that there must be some separation time between de facto stability and de jure stability. In his opinion, a conference should be convened to discuss this matter. The UK, Japan, the US, France, and Germany should join this conference. The purpose is to persuade President Roosevelt not to use his power to depress the price of the dollar, on the condition that the UK agrees to the existing US-UK exchange rate and the UK-Japan exchange rate.</p>

<h3 id="e95">The Tumultuous Politics of Japan (Tokyo Correspondence) <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Function of Parliamentary Politics is Completely Lost</p>
<p>Military Despotism Awaits the Future</p>
<p>Speculation on the Lifespan of the Saito Cabinet</p>
<p>Since Saito Makoto received the imperial order to form a cabinet, he has replaced five cabinet members in a row. The heads of the Navy, Army, Foreign Affairs, Commerce and Industry, and Education departments have all been replaced, with almost half of the cabinet members leaving office. According to common sense, the cabinet would have no reason not to collapse. Even if it is said to be a collaborative cabinet in times of emergency, there cannot be such a lack of linkage between cabinet members and between cabinet members and the entire cabinet body. Moreover, Japan still hangs the signboard of constitutional politics, and the parliament is still manipulated by the Zaibatsu behind the scenes. In other words, politics is still somewhat influenced by politics. Furthermore, the recent bribery scandal of Hatoyama Ichiro has superficially been glossed over. Hatoyama himself did not take bribes, but the ugliness of the political parties, whether it is the Seiyukai or the Minseito, is the same, exposed to the public. The credibility of parliamentary politics has been completely lost. At the same time, there have been twenty or thirty cases of schools in the education sector being prosecuted by the courts for bribery. Recently, the heads of the inspection and social education departments of the Tokyo Education Bureau were also prosecuted, and there is a tendency for this to expand in the future. This is not just a temporary stain on the Japanese government. From this prosecution, the ugly state of the Japanese education sector is exposed. It is said that to become an elementary school principal, if there is no financial power to mediate, then no matter how capable or hardworking you are, you will never have the hope of promotion. You can only be a teacher for the rest of your life and cannot develop your talents. Therefore, unfortunate incidents often occur in the Japanese education sector.</p>
<p>The problem of the decline of the rural economy also seems to have a subtle sign of improvement on the surface, but in reality, products are piled up like mountains. Not only is it not easy to reduce them at all, but there is also a tendency to increase them. For example, the price of rice, according to the calculation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the production cost of each koku of rice is 23 yen and 34 sen, while the market price is only around 22 yen. After deducting transportation costs, it can be seen that it is difficult for rural life to have any hope of improvement in the short term. This is another reason for political instability and cabinet shake-ups in Japan.</p>
<p>Newspapers speculate that the Saito cabinet will collapse in the early summer of this year. The reason is that after the budget proposal is compiled, its mission is over. Furthermore, the general public dislikes it for being lifeless, and the military does not necessarily have to support it.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, there is still the possibility of it continuing. First, in the Diet, the Minseito is at least a quasi-government party and expresses goodwill towards the current government. At the same time, it is wary of the arrogance of the military. It is feared that after Saito steps down, if either Konoe Fumimaro or Hiranuma Kiichirō comes to power, they will exhibit stronger military politics, and the political parties will inevitably suffer, and the Zaibatsu will inevitably be restricted. Second, although the relationship between the Seiyukai and Saito has gradually deteriorated, it is not yet so bad. Therefore, the Saito cabinet has a great possibility of prolonging its life. The third is a reason among insufficient reasons, that is, the problem of the successor after Saito steps down. It is quite difficult to find a suitable person at this time. Needless to say, a political party cabinet has no possibility of being realized. The person supported by the young officers is not liked by the Genrō (elder statesmen), and the Zaibatsu also opposes him. It is difficult to find a neutral, detached person who is stronger than Saito. Ugaki, Takahashi, and Kiyoura each have their weaknesses.</p>
<p>So, can Saito safely overcome the difficulties? This is another question. The reality is that Mr. Aomoto Shuzo, the former Vice-Minister of Railways and current member of the House of Peers, is pressing Mito Chuzo to establish a new railway. This can easily lead to the House of Peers impeaching political societies. Even if there is still a strong atmosphere in the House of Peers to let the Saito cabinet fulfill its responsibilities, once a branch issue occurs, and another cabinet member issue arises, the future is truly difficult to predict. Furthermore, the National League is indeed a minority party in the House of Representatives, and its power is also limited, but it has military connections behind it and has also developed relationships with right-wing groups. Therefore, its movement cannot be underestimated. It believes that two cabinet members of the same cabinet have simultaneously committed disciplinary violations, and this responsibility is not just for a certain cabinet member but for the entire cabinet. Therefore, it wants to propose a vote of no confidence, at least to expose the stains of the current cabinet as much as possible, thereby creating a bad atmosphere in the House of Peers and triggering public antipathy. If the Saito cabinet cannot satisfactorily resolve the work of supplementing the positions of education chiefs after the Diet session ends, then the lifespan of the current cabinet will truly be difficult to prolong (March 9).</p>
<h3 id="e96">Qingdao Municipal Government Reliefs Native Produce Exports <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Speculation, Hoarding, and Profiteering</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Mayor of Qingdao Shen Honglie, due to the sluggish sales of Shandong native products and the plight of merchants, in order to provide relief, had previously requested the central government via Governor Han Fuqu of the Shandong Provincial Government to reduce export tax rates to assist the export of native products, and also advised Qingdao capitalists to raise funds to organize a Puli company to specialize in purchasing raw rice and exporting it overseas. Also, fearing that unscrupulous merchants would take the opportunity to hoard and manipulate prices, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was ordered to investigate and register the quantity of native products currently in the city. Imported goods must also be registered with the Social Affairs Bureau, prepared for export overseas, and not allowed to be sold locally. After this adjustment, the market greatly enlivened. The quantity of raw rice exported from March 2 to March 21 has reached more than 11,400 tons (approximately 862,000 yuan). The Puli company has purchased more than 40,000 bags, approximately 3,600 tons, which can be shipped out in early April. Other businesses engaged in overseas exports are buying raw rice on a large scale, preparing to export it overseas during the tax reduction period. According to the Social Affairs Bureau's investigation, the quantity of native products currently stored in the city includes more than 449,000 bags of raw rice, more than 37,000 bags of peanuts, and more than 18,600 baskets of raw oil. Just taking raw rice as an example, approximately 100,000 bags have been exported, and the 300,000 bags still stored in the city can also be shipped out in the shortest possible time. However, during this period, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no speculative unscrupulous merchants hoarding and profiteering or arbitrarily manipulating the situation. It is imperative to take precautions and strictly prohibit them. The Ministry of Finance has also received reports that there are many such speculators in Qingdao, asking the municipal government to pay attention. The municipal government has issued a notice to the municipal chamber of commerce to instruct the exchange and various native product merchants to comply. The text of the municipal government's order to the municipal chamber of commerce is recorded as follows: "Approved Ministry of Finance consultation opened, regarding Qingdao, Jinan, Weihaiwei, Yantai and other places, within a fixed period of three months, to export peanuts, raw peanut kernels, peanut oil reported overseas, should be given a 61% reduction in export tax according to the original export tax rate. The Ministry had previously ordered the customs to comply and consulted your municipal government for reference, originally because peanut kernels are a major export of our country and also the main agricultural product of Shandong Province, which has a significant impact on the livelihood of farmers and local finance. Your municipal government has also repeatedly requested relief in response to the current plight of farmers and businesses, and the Ministry is willing to sacrifice tax revenue to implement the above-mentioned tax reduction measures to show its joint support for the export of native products. However, according to investigation reports, speculators in Qingdao are using the miscellaneous grain exchange as a place to profit, hoping that the market price of overseas peanuts will rise, so that the peanuts they purchased can have surplus profits to fulfill their desires for speculation and profiteering. Even bankers and people who have nothing to do with the production and sale of peanut kernels have joined this gambling transaction in order to try their luck. Bank loans are not guaranteed by reliable export contracts, but must have actual goods as collateral. As a result, local market prices are so high that they exceed the prices of Indian and Dalian products opened overseas. The inability of Shandong peanut kernels to be exported is greatly related to this unnatural environment. The Ministry believes that reducing tax donations to reduce the cost of peanut kernels is originally intended to adapt to foreign market prices, so as to maintain the status of foreign trade and relieve the livelihood of farmers. Those who have nothing to do with the production and sale of peanut kernels are manipulating the market by means of speculation and profiteering, causing the local price of peanut kernels to rise. Farmers have not enjoyed the benefits of this price increase, and the export of peanut kernels is adversely affected as a result, which is obviously contrary to the government's original intention of relief. How to restrict speculators based on the production situation of peanut kernels and the original price of production areas is a matter of farmers' interests and foreign trade. In addition to consulting separately, it is appropriate to consult your municipal government to consider and handle it and reply to He et al. Approved here, check this matter has been convened each merchant to explain earnestly, and has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau strictly prohibit the record, since the former by, Yingdang followed suit, if each native produce merchants still have intentional speculation hoarding profiteering circumstances, the government will strictly investigate and prohibit, never connivance, in addition to consulting the reply, should go to make the Association transferred to the exchange and various native produce merchants comply, this order.

<h3 id="e97">Chaoshan Relief Financial Measures <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Commercial Banknote Total Amount Increased to Ten Million</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Decides on Issuance Measures</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Chaoshan financial exhaustion. The provincial government previously decided to approve the issuance of 4 million yuan of commercial banknotes to provide relief. However, there were internal differences of opinion within the chamber of commerce. Due to the uneven distribution of Chaoyang Chenghai gangs, the issuance of commercial banknotes caused great obstacles. Matters such as the resignation of Chen Shaowen and the fraudulent election of members have been discovered repeatedly. Financial relief is increasingly impossible, industry and commerce are in distress, and all industries are in depression. East District member Li Yangjing once expressed the need to persuade business leaders to sacrifice their prejudices and work together to overcome the difficulties. On the 14th, the City Chamber of Commerce welcomed Li Yangjing to the meeting for guidance. When Li arrived at the Chamber of Commerce, he persuaded the representatives, saying that the commercial banknotes had been approved by the provincial government and should be implemented as soon as possible to provide relief. As a result, business leaders were very willing to unite and cooperate so that the commercial banknotes could be issued as soon as possible to provide relief. Eight items were immediately decided: (1) Ask the provincial government to exempt the deposit of 20% of central banknotes when issuing banknotes. (2) Increase the total amount of commercial banknotes to 10 million yuan. (3) Change the face value of commercial banknotes to 100 yuan and 200 yuan, two types. (4) The 1.9 million yuan of guaranteed white notes, auxiliary banknotes, and guarantee slips issued by various silver shops must be fully recovered within one month after the issuance of commercial banknotes. As for the 3 million yuan of guaranteed banknotes, they must also be fully recovered within six months after the issuance of commercial banknotes. (5) The price of industrial property to guarantee the issuance of commercial banknotes, the original regulations stipulated that the house will be calculated at 70%, but in order to avoid the deposit of 20% of the Chinese currency, the foundation of the banknote should be stable so as not to cause danger, so the industrial property of houses guaranteed to issue commercial banknotes will be calculated at 50%, and the land will be calculated at 40%. As the price of Haitan land is lower, for fear of fraud, it should not be guaranteed. (6) The price of the exchanged guaranteed industrial property should be re-evaluated, because the price of industrial property depends on the rise and fall of the market price. (7) The exchange of industrial property should be approved by the full committee. (8) The articles of association for the issuance of commercial banknotes originally stipulated a weekly interest rate of 2%, which will be used as funds. However, the funds should be frugal, and the weekly interest rate should be changed to 4%, which should be paid in two periods per year. Each period should be divided into six months, with 5% of the funds being used for the association's expenses and 95% being saved for the business bank that issues the commercial banknotes to deduct it when it is recovered in the future. That is, if a business bank issues 10,000 yuan of commercial banknotes, the weekly interest rate is 4%, and the annual interest payable is 400 yuan. Of these 400 yuan, 5% will be used for expenses (i.e., 20 yuan), and the remaining 3.8 million will be saved by the association. If the interest paid is in commercial banknotes, 5% will be withdrawn, and the remaining 95% will be destroyed. If cash is paid, it will be used as the bottom when it is recovered in the future (i.e., 100 yuan of commercial banknotes issued should pay 400 yuan of current ocean interest. In addition to 20 yuan for expenses, only 9,620 yuan will be recovered in the future, because the owed 380 yuan has been offset by the interest paid). Regarding the above eight items, Li Yangjing has requested the provincial government to adopt them as appropriate. If the amount of 10 million yuan can be issued, the Chaoshan financial situation can be expected to find a solution. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Liu Gui Tang's Remnants Fled Back to Bao Du Mountain <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Lu Army's Encirclement and Suppression Suffered Heavy Casualties</p>
<p>Han Fu Ju Returned to Ji'nan from Jieshou</p>
<p>Ji'nan Correspondence: Liu Gui Tang's remnant bandits in the Wen Shang area, after being fiercely attacked by government troops and suffering heavy losses, deeply realized that the provincial army's defenses were tight along the Jinpu Railway south of Tai'an. They changed their strategy and split into two groups, fleeing north, one entering Pingyin and the other running to Feicheng. By the evening of the 23rd, they fled east again, approaching the Jinpu Railway line, hoping to cut off the railway east from the area north of Tai'an, from Shou Wande to Zhangxia. Han Fu Ju immediately dispatched troops to intercept them, ordering Sun Tongxuan to station troops in Wande, leading the pistol battalion, engineering battalion, and Zhang Deyin's regiment of the 81st Division's Zhan Shutang, to block and attack along the road. Han also personally went to Jieshou to command, and fierce battles broke out overnight near Wande. Liu's bandits, by this time, felt that they were at the end of their rope, so they decided to make a final struggle, dividing into several small groups of thirty or fifty to sixty people each. Starting at three o'clock this morning (the 24th), they began to flee across the Jinpu Railway from Jieshou Wande, north of Tai'an, in separate groups. Government troops resolutely counterattacked, and Dai Hongbin also commanded armored vehicle teams to patrol and encircle, killing many bandits and capturing countless camels. However, because most of Liu's bandits were cavalry, they desperately fled. As a result, all the remaining bandits fled east across the railway. By dawn this morning, there was no trace of the bandits. The bandit force, estimated to be still over a thousand people, all fled towards the Meng Mountain area. Han Fu Ju, believing that since Liu's bandits had crossed the railway, they would certainly flee back to their old nest in the Meng Mountain and Bao Du Mountain area of southern Shandong, immediately ordered the 81st Division's Yun Qichang brigade and the 74th Division's Ma Guanyi brigade to be responsible for pursuing Liu's remaining bandits, ordering them to completely eliminate the bandits within a month. The headquarters also issued a wireless radio to each brigade to facilitate communication. The Yun Qichang brigade arrived at Jieshou and disembarked, and the Ma Guanyi brigade also took three trains from Da Wenkou and disembarked at Tai'an to join the Yun brigade and advance east to pursue and suppress Liu's bandits.</p>
<p>Han Fu Ju, believing that Liu's bandits had fled east, returned to Ji'nan by train from Jieshou at eleven o'clock this morning. According to Han, after being encircled and suppressed by the provincial army, Liu Gui Tang's bandit force had fled in disarray. The remaining bandits, estimated to be over a thousand people, had crossed the railway eastward at three o'clock this morning, and it was predicted that they would flee back to their old nest in Bao Du Mountain in southern Shandong. The Yun Qichang brigade and the Ma Guanyi brigade had been dispatched to pursue them, hoping to annihilate them in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Last night (the 23rd), due to the congestion of military trains in the area north of An, the 301st through train from Peiping to Shanghai and the 3rd train from Jinpu to Pukou were both blocked in Ji'nan. This morning, the 302nd through train from Peiping to Shanghai from the south was also stopped in Xuzhou and dared not head north. Also, the 1st train from Peiping to Pukou from the north was blocked after arriving in Ji'nan at 9:20 and could not head south. A total of three trains were stopped at the Ji station, and north-south traffic was cut off. It was not until 10:00 this morning that the military trains in the Jieshou area cleared the way, and the trains blocked in Ji'nan gradually headed south (24th).</p>

<p>Weng Weiqing's family, a resident of the Xuantan Temple Township in Pudong, was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits on the night of March 7th this year. Each bandit was armed with a deadly weapon and broke into the house, tying up the victim, Weng Weiqing, and his son, Weng Xiding. The bandits burned off the victim's beard and beat him, causing him to fall to the ground groaning in pain. The bandits then swarmed into the house one after another, arbitrarily looting before leaving. Afterward, the water and land police teams rigorously investigated and arrested Chen Caisheng, a suspect in the case, near Shengzi Temple. He confessed to the robbery at the scene and also implicated several accomplices. After verifying his confession, the team detained the suspect for further questioning. Yesterday, another team was dispatched to the countryside to arrest the remaining suspects.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Suzhou: Lu Fusheng is a Prime Suspect in the Assassination Case in Jiaozhi West Market <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Ma Fushou, a resident of No. 73 Shangtang, West Market, Jiaozhi, was a man of modest means. He had a younger sister who married Lu Fusheng (also known as Ma Fusheng) from the same town. On the night of November 23rd of the previous year, Fushou, his mother Zhou, his wife Wang, and his eleven-year-old son, A Jin, went to a wedding banquet at the Zhang family, relatives less than half a li away, at the Huitan Temple. After the banquet ended at seven o'clock, Fushou and his wife took their son home first. At two o'clock in the morning, their hired worker, Chen Hongsheng (who was helping at the Zhang family), returned home with Ma's son-in-law, Fusheng. They parted ways midway. When Chen arrived at the Ma house, he found the row gate unlocked. Upon entering, he discovered that Fushou, his wife, and his son, A Jin, had all been murdered in their beds. The case has remained unsolved for a long time. Xie Guoan, the chief of the responsible Public Security 7th Branch, recently learned that when Ma's son-in-law, Lu Fusheng, was interrogated by local authorities after the incident, he had handed a package wrapped in newspaper to villagers Yang Azhao, A Jinshou, and A Yinsheng, asking them to discard it in the river. Yang opened the package and found two sharp knives inside with yellow bloodstains. On New Year's Eve of the previous year, he borrowed money from Fusheng, who gave him a rice husking bed worth six silver dollars. It was also learned that Ma Fushou's mother, Zhou, had given part of her farmland to her son-in-law, Fusheng, so she often stayed at her son-in-law's house. Zhou had a hidden cache of four thousand yuan, and it was rumored that Fusheng had dug it up after the incident. On the 25th, Yang Azhao, A Jinshou, A Yinsheng, and Lu Fusheng were taken into custody. The district head, town head, and local bailiffs were summoned to investigate the cache at the Ma house. As a result, three large earthenware jars were unearthed. One was empty and discarded on the ground, while the other two were buried deep in the soil. One contained soil and 104 silver dollars, and the other contained 1,128 silver dollars. In addition, Zhou had recently sold forty mu of land for 2,196 silver dollars, but the money could not be found. Lu Fusheng, the prime suspect, was handed over to the Public Security Bureau yesterday (the 26th). After questioning the witnesses, Yang Azhao and others, who confessed to the above, Lu Fusheng admitted that the two knives were indeed his, but he asked Lu and others to dispose of them out of fear of suspicion.

<p>The Suzhou-Changzhou Highway is now scheduled to begin construction next month. Yesterday (the 26th), Yu Liqi, the director of the Engineering Office, came to Suzhou from Zhenjiang and went to Lumu for inspection. The office decided to set up an office in Changshu, with Pan Siqian in charge, and a branch office in Likou Jiejing. The road will have a total of 24 bridges, 13 culverts, and 60 ditches. It was originally planned to be built through conscripted labor, but due to the busy farming season, it was feared that there would be no good results, so it was changed to a contract system. Bids are scheduled to be opened on April 2nd, construction will begin on the 10th, and it is scheduled to be completed by mid-June for long-distance traffic.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Wuxi: The Pingmin Xi Yi Institute Incident Resolved <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>At the Pingmin Xi Yi Institute in our city, in the late night of the 23rd of this month, an apprentice, Xia Shengbao, suddenly committed suicide due to severe stress. The remaining apprentices were all indignant and rioted, destroying the sanitation room and beating Director Wu and others, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that since the institute was established in 1929, it has been poorly managed and riddled with corruption. The apprentices were treated very harshly, even to the point of being unable to eat their fill, worse than prison inmates. When working in the workshop, they were whipped for the slightest mistake. As for wages, they received only a few cents per month, and even that was not always paid. Recently, apprentice Xia Shengbao contracted typhoid fever and was very ill. He requested medical treatment from the personnel department, but the personnel department said harshly, "Why ask for a doctor? No one has died in this institute for a long time, and there are several coffins piled up." Xia Shengbao, severely affected by this, committed suicide. When the apprentices heard this news, they rioted. At nine o'clock yesterday morning, County Magistrate Yan personally went to the institute to investigate and summoned all the apprentices for a lecture, warning them not to cause any more trouble. At that time, the apprentices also explained their suffering to County Magistrate Yan, requesting three improvements to the institute: 1. The apprenticeship period for general apprentices should be shortened to one year, and the apprenticeship period for special apprentices should be shortened to four months. 2. The apprentices' meals should be improved to meet sanitary standards. 3. Qian Laosi, who was beaten by the director during the disturbance, should be sent out for medical treatment. County Magistrate Yan agreed to find ways to improve these things. The apprentices were satisfied and returned to the workshop to work as usual. Xie Wenhua, Yang Ahong, Wang Ruming, and the other three apprentices who caused the trouble were sent to the county government for questioning. The order in the institute is now maintained by more than eighty police officers and more than ten police officers from the Third Branch, who are armed day and night to maintain order. At the same time, Pingmin Institute Chairman Qian Qing and Wu Bangzhou discussed the aftermath with County Magistrate Yan. It was decided that those who have learned enough to support themselves will be released as appropriate. Those who are from local families and are being taken care of should notify their parents to come to the institute to take them back within three days to avoid further trouble. The special department will be disbanded immediately. It is rumored that Zou Tongyi will be hired as the director.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Court Orders Gu Renfa to Appear for Questioning <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhuo, the former chief of the Second Public Security Bureau, and his wife, Wen Rongzhen, were arrested and imprisoned for resisting transfer and obstructing official duties. The case also involved Su Province Civil Affairs Director Gu Renfa's wife, Li Shuyun, and her daughter, who were also arrested in Shanghai and sent to Wuxi for interrogation. It is now learned that after the County Court Prosecutor's Office investigated the case according to law, it determined that there was no evidence of Li Shuyun selling official positions and collecting money, so it did not need to investigate. It only focused on the part of obstructing official duties. The court sent a letter to the County Public Security Bureau a few days ago, requesting that the seized evidence be sent to the court for verification. Chief Li approved the letter and sent the eight pieces of evidence related to Li Shuyun found in Liu Zhuomin and his wife's luggage to the court. However, Li Shuyun denied sending a letter to Liu's wife and requested to compare handwriting. Yesterday, the court received two more pieces of evidence from the Civil Affairs Department, claiming that Li Shuyun was engaging in fraud. After Qian, the chief judge, reviewed them, he determined that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Li Shuyun had committed fraud and collecting money. Moreover, Li Shuyun is Director Gu's wife, and Director Gu is the informant in this case. According to criminal procedure, it is necessary to order Gu Renfa to appear in court for questioning. Chief Judge Qian and President Xu discussed it and decided to send a telegram to Chen Guofu, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, to forward it to Gu, as Gu is now in Jiangxi and it is difficult to send a summons. The telegram was sent that evening, and the original text read, "Please order Gu Renfa to bring evidence and come to court for questioning in person," etc. It is not known whether Gu Renfa will respect the national judiciary and come to Wuxi to surrender for questioning. As for Li Shuyun, since being detained in the detention center, she has suffered excessive stress and developed a severe stomach ailment, with alternating chills and fever, moaning in prison, and the situation is very tragic. Li Wenhui, Li Shuyun's uncle, visited her a few nights ago, and Shuyun complained a lot and couldn't help but sigh. Liu Zhuomin's second son, Zhuxin (10 years old), who has fallen into a foreign land, also fell ill in the hostel yesterday. Also, after Yan Shenyu, the magistrate of this county, angrily resigned from his position due to this case, telegrams from all walks of life were sent to the province requesting his retention, flying like snowflakes. Yesterday, the County Party Department, the County Property Office, the Municipal Management Committee, the County Chamber of Commerce, and the County Farmers' Association organized the Agricultural Workers' Union and the Silk Factory Industrial Workers' Union, all sending telegrams to retain him. However, Magistrate Yan's resignation is firm. Although the provincial government issued an order of consolation and retention, his attitude is negative. Yesterday (the 26th), he continued to submit a second letter of resignation to the provincial government. The original telegram read, "Chairman Chen and Director Gu of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the previous telegram of resignation has been received. Shenyu has stated the circumstances sincerely. Recently, I have been overworked and feel increasingly physically exhausted. Wuxi is located in an important area, and it is also at a time of reorganization of the police force and re-division of districts. The political affairs are complicated and I am afraid of causing delays. I beg you to approve my request as soon as possible and select someone to take over. I am extremely apprehensive and await orders." Yan Shenyu, Magistrate of Wuxi County, respectfully begs for forgiveness.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth District Office and the Second Public Security Bureau of Wuyi County, believing that the Han Zong Nunnery in the Bajiao Township of their jurisdiction had previously been the scene of a robbery, conducted separate investigations and apprehended Wu Jinyuan, one of the bandits involved in the case. He was brought before the county government for questioning, and he confessed to the robbery and said that there were still accomplices at large. The Fifteenth District Office and the Second Public Security Bureau then conducted further investigations. Recently, He Wenquan, the leader of the Seventh Jia of the Bao Wei, learned that He Tingwei, a wanted suspect in the case, had been hiding outside and had now returned. He sent militiamen to arrest him and brought him to the district for preliminary interrogation. The suspect confessed to robbing Han Zong and admitted to spending the stolen goods. He was recorded his confession, and the suspect was sent to the county for questioning yesterday (the 25th).</p>

<p>Jin Jiwen, the inspection director of the Wuyi Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, led inspectors and passed by Baijia Bridge outside the East Gate on the 25th. Seeing a cargo ship, they boarded it for inspection. After a detailed examination, they found a box of anti-Japanese shuttles, totaling 200, transported by the Shanghai Jinchang Iron Factory to the Changzhou Lida Cloth Factory, and a piece of anti-Japanese shuttles, totaling 100, transported by the Shanghai Xiangchang Organization Hardware Store to the Changzhou Lida Cloth Factory. There were also five bundles of suspected anti-Japanese yarn spools of various sizes. All the goods were brought to the association. It is heard that the shuttle part is definitely anti-Japanese goods. The yarn spools will be handled after identification.</p>

<p>Yida ginseng shop on Tianzhutang Street in this port has been open for more than ten years. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 25th, the electric wire caught fire, and the fire spread to the house. Fortunately, the fire brigade arrived in time to put out the fire, and only one row of cargo rooms was burned down. The shop has tens of thousands of yuan in fire insurance, so the loss is small.</p>

<p>The people of Jiangbei believe that Jiangbei is vast and transportation is obstructed, and there is a real need to establish a local court to facilitate litigation. Therefore, when Justice Minister Luo inspected Yangzhou two months ago, representatives from all walks of life repeatedly petitioned Luo. It is heard that a local court will soon be established in Yangzhou. However, according to detailed investigations, it is completely different from the nature of the above-mentioned additional local court. Because the central government plans to adopt a three-level, three-trial system, all county courts in the country will be abolished uniformly. In the future, the first trial will be held in the local court, and its jurisdiction will be based on the county as a unit. Therefore, although the name of the Jiangdu Branch is elevated, the actual judicial power is reduced. The hope of the people here to add a local court above the county court is probably hopeless. However, it is hoped that the judicial authorities will set up a higher branch court within the territory of Yangzhou to avoid the hardships of litigants traveling.</p>

<p>Since receiving the order from the Provincial Security Department of our county to compile the first phase of the reserve team, the district offices of our county have sent personnel to the towns and villages under their jurisdiction to start the compilation, so that they can be sent to the county for training as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, the ignorant farmers all held a timid concept. The strong men who were drafted cried and begged to be exempted, while the brave ones stubbornly resisted. Yesterday, the farmers in the countryside near the Da Ningzhuang Town in the county planned to draft strong men for future combat use. As a result, five or six hundred people gathered and swarmed to the district office, destroying all the tables, chairs, and utensils, and burning all the documents and books. The district head, Lu Baozhi, and the staff of the office all fled to escape and were able to escape safely. Later, Ji Dasheng, the head of the village, knelt down and kowtowed countless times to the farmers before they all retreated. The Public Security Bureau initially sent police to suppress the riot, but seeing five or six hundred farmers, drunk and crazy, and difficult to suppress, they retreated. For a time, the city was alarmed and the order was in chaos.</p>

All the patrolmen on the ship rushed to the steamship, dragged the steamship owner ashore, and beat him severely. As a result, the sailors on the steamship also resisted the patrolmen. Although the patrol captain and local merchants tried to persuade them, it was ineffective. Fortunately, the leader of the security backbone team sent team members to report to Captain Wang of the Water Police, and the two sides worked together to suppress the situation before it subsided.</p>

<p>Lu Diping, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, has been overworked in presiding over the provincial government. His health has not fully recovered since his illness last year. At 8:00 p.m. on March 22nd, Lu took a car to the private residence of Yang Mianzhong, a member of the Provincial Government Committee, on Changsheng Road to discuss political affairs. At about 9:00, he suddenly felt dizzy and was immediately treated by Chinese and Western doctors. The next day, he telegraphed to Shanghai to invite Dr. Le Wenzhao to Hangzhou for diagnosis and treatment. According to the doctor, it was a recurrence of his old illness due to overwork, and he has made great progress in recent days, eating milk and bread every day. When Lu fell ill, Yang Mianzhong telegraphed Nanchang to report his condition to Chairman Chiang. Today, Chiang replied by telegram, instructing Lu to rest and recuperate. Lu has telegraphed to the Central Executive Yuan to request a one-month leave for recuperation. His duties will be taken over by Lu Bichou, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs.

<p>The Entire Country Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Tang Youren, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, went to Peiping to inspect the situation in North China. He has now returned to Nanjing after completing his official duties. He arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the morning before yesterday and is scheduled to return to Nanjing on Wednesday. After visiting President Wang, he will go to Wuhan to inspect and represent President Wang to comfort Shi Ying, the mayor of Beijing, who is staying in Wuhan.

<p>According to Tang, his trip to Peiping and Tianjin was purely to inspect the real situation in North China, and there were no important tasks. The rumors circulating have already been denied, and such rumors are not worth the attention of knowledgeable people. The situation in North China is extremely complex, not a local problem for North China, but a problem for the entire country. The entire country should pay attention to it. Tang also said that when he passed through Tianjin, he saw a large number of refugees coming and going on the streets, and the situation was extremely painful. It is necessary to find ways to provide relief immediately, as this is related to the problem of public security in North China.</p>

<p>Regarding the incident of British troops entering Yunnan and overstepping their authority to excavate mineral resources in Ban Hong, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has paid close attention to this. Therefore, since this problem occurred, it has advocated sending personnel to Yunnan to investigate the border areas on the one hand, and surveying and determining the border lines on the other hand. There are as many as five possible border lines in that area. After the border line problem is solved, other negotiations will be carried out.</p>

<p>As for the revision of the Sino-British trade treaty and the signing of the Sino-Russian trade treaty, the reporter asked Tang. According to Tang, the revision of the Sino-British trade treaty has been rumored for a long time. Since the British envoy, Cadogan, arrived in China, the two sides have not conducted formal negotiations. Therefore, the issue of revising the Sino-British trade treaty remains to be negotiated. However, it is learned that when Wang Rutang was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he drafted a revision draft in the department. Therefore, it is believed that the progress of this issue will take this draft as a reference. As for the signing of the Sino-Russian treaty, the two sides are now waiting to negotiate. There are many issues between China and Russia that need to be discussed, and they should be carried out one by one.</p>

<p>Special Envoy Mr. Lin Siwen Returns to Fujian</p>
<p>Investigating the Production and Sales of the Sugar Industry</p>
<p>In recent years, the economic panic overseas has reached its peak, and compatriots are being excluded everywhere. Therefore, the number of people investing in the motherland's industries is increasing daily. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Batavia, Dutch Java, held its eleventh board meeting last month. It was resolved to hire Mr. Lin Siwen to return to China and investigate the production and sales of the sugar industry in Zhangzhou, Fujian, as the precursor to overseas Chinese investing in the motherland. It is found that the amount of sugarcane sugar consumed in our country every year is very large, and the amount of sugarcane sugar imported from abroad every year is more than tens of millions of yuan, which is a major leakage. The geology and climate of the Zhangzhou area of Fujian Province are suitable for planting sugarcane and preparing for sugar production, and nearby Xiamen has convenient transportation and can be used as an export port. If large-scale factories can be used to produce sugar, the development of the national sugar industry can be controlled in the future. Newly arrived overseas Chinese now residing in Xiamen have brought back huge sums of money. According to Mr. Liu Shimu's investigation, the amount is about 70 million yuan, and they deeply feel that there is nowhere to invest. If the sugar industry develops, businesses related to other industries such as transportation can also develop accordingly, in order to fulfill the fundamental purpose of enabling people to use their talents to the fullest and land to use its resources to the fullest. This will not only be the driving force for building a new Fujian but also a shortcut for overseas Chinese to invest. Mr. Lin Siwen, originally from southern Fujian, has lived in Java, Nanyang, for generations, but he is extremely enthusiastic about advocating for the motherland's industries. He graduated from Baoding Military Academy and served as an instructor at the Whampoa Military Academy and Dean of Students at Jinan University. He is quite familiar with the situation in the country. His assignment to return to China for investigation this time is truly a fortunate choice. It is now heard that Mr. Lin will arrive in Shanghai soon and plans to go to Beijing first to visit Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan and other agencies, requesting the government to send special commissioners to investigate together. The Ministry of Industry, the Fujian Provincial Government, and the Nanjing Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee have all received reports from the Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce in advance, ordering their subordinates to provide military and police protection for Mr. Lin as he travels through various places to facilitate his progress.</p>

<p>Yesterday Sent a Representative to Visit Lin Aimin</p>
<p>The Overseas Travel Group Rescue Association of Western Fujian, in view of the urgent crisis facing overseas Chinese, sent its chairman, Wu Yuwen, to visit Mr. Lin Aimin's residence yesterday to inquire about the situation of overseas compatriots, in order to understand the recent overseas situation. According to him, there used to be more than 200,000 overseas compatriots, who were very influential overseas. In recent years, due to the strict restrictions imposed by the local government, the number has decreased slightly. Taking Singapore as an example, in the past, nine out of ten residents there were Chinese. In recent years, the number has also decreased due to the impact of the global economic downturn. According to investigations, Singapore has a population of more than 400,000, but Chinese account for more than 300,000. However, due to various influences, overseas compatriots are in great pain. In addition, overseas Chinese in western Fujian have suffered repeated chaos in their hometowns and cannot return home, which doubles their suffering. They hope that the government and overseas compatriots will actively find ways to resettle and provide relief.</p>

<p>Discussion of Fines: Expulsion: Public Announcement: Suspension of Loans</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Woolen Fabric Trade Association inquiring about how to punish stores that sell inferior goods if they are found to be based on evidence. After investigating the economic severance of relations with Japan, which was decided at the Provisional Member Representative Assembly of the Chamber on September 20th, stores that privately sell Japanese goods are violating the original resolution and destroying the boycott agreement. The association, as a leader in the industry, should impose fines or expulsion based on the severity of the circumstances, and publish it in the newspaper to warn others. If they are not members, the association should admonish the industry to regard them as public enemies in terms of morality and justice, and unanimously sever business dealings with them. At the same time, it can send a letter to the Chamber to inform the banking industry to suspend their loans to show their intention to abandon them with the public. Its effectiveness may exceed that of reputation sanctions. This is the only feasible and legal way for the business community to sanction public enemies at present. Accordingly, we reply in a letter, hoping that you will earnestly comply with it. This is of utmost importance, etc.</p>

After the bureau revised the size of the ships twice, construction has now begun. The first two seagoing vessels will arrive in September this year from England to Shanghai. The bureau has sent crew members to England for training to prepare to bring the new ships to China. The shipowners and crew members have also been selected and are approved to set sail next month.

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company borrowed 400,000 pounds of Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds to build four new seagoing vessels in London. Special Commissioners Wu Daming and Shi Gan were sent to London to submit bids for construction. At that time, because the length of the ships did not meet the requirements and exceeded the estimated construction cost, the bureau continued to discuss and changed the length of the four new ships to 314 feet and telegraphed England to re-submit bids. As a result, a shipbuilding contract has been signed in London. A telegram has been sent to Shanghai stating that construction has begun and that the construction can be completed in about six months. The first batch of two ships will be delivered and sail to Shanghai in September this year.</p>

<p>Effective from April 1st for One Year</p>
<p>The current tap water price in the Public Concession was agreed upon by the Public Works Department and the Water Company last year and has been in trial operation for one year since April 1st last year. At the board meeting of the Public Works Department last Wednesday, the Director General reported that the Water Company and the Water Price Review Committee had sent letters stating matters regarding water prices. The Water Price Review Committee decided on the 8th of this month to recommend to the Public Works Department that the water price be uniformly calculated at 80% from April 1st of this year, with a period of one year, and then discussed again after the expiration. The company's letter to the Public Works Department also made the same recommendation. According to the opinion of the Water Price Review Committee, the proposed discount will not affect the company's financial position, and the discount should be regarded as a temporary relief measure for users. The revision of the water price list will be discussed in detail by the committee. After discussion by the board of directors of the Public Works Department, it was decided to approve the company's request and uniformly calculate the water price at 80% from April 1st of this year.</p>

<h3 id="e142">The First Sound of the Production and Sales Company's Implementation Plan <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Raising Funds to Establish a Nanjing National Goods Company</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Support from the Banking Community in Beijing</p>
<p>After the establishment of the China National Goods Production and Sales Joint Company was announced, the first board of supervisors meeting decided to follow the suggestion of the Beijing Municipal Government to invest and assist in the establishment of the Nanjing National Goods Company and decided to proceed with preparations. Previously, Chen Qibo and Wu Guangzhi were specially sent to Beijing to contact the municipal government regarding the implementation procedures. Recently, Wu Tingsheng, General Manager of the company, and Ren Jinping, Secretary-General of the Board of Supervisors, went to Beijing one after another. It is now heard that they have obtained the consent of Mayor Shi and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry to serve as the directors of the preparatory committee, and Zhang Mengwen has been hired as the chief director of the preparatory office. People from all walks of life in Beijing, in view of the seriousness of the national crisis, deeply know that the promotion of national goods and the development of production cannot be delayed. They have all risen up in response and enthusiastically participated. The banking community is particularly enthusiastic. It is learned that the following people have signed up to join as directors: Luo Nezhai of the National Goods Bank, Fu Zhongfu of the Citizens Bank, Sun Yinong of the China-South Bank, Lu Cangyan of the Shanghai Bank, Ge Xiaoshan of the Yanye Bank, Bian Boping of the Shiye Bank, Wang Endong of the Jincheng Bank, and Ying Shangde, Ma Yiqun, Qu Wansen, Zhang Songtang, Yu Zhisheng, Zhang Xinfu's wife, Wang Guangzu, Zhuang Xianglin, Chen Hanqing, Li Jinhui, Huang Cilun, Chen Chuqiao, Ka Zhuxuan, Wang Gongtao, Qian Shushu, Ye Zhaochang, Zhan Tianxi, Zhang Bingsen, and more than 20 others. The founding meeting of the board of directors was held in the Beijing municipal government a few days ago, chaired by Mayor Shi (Lai Lian as acting mayor), with General Manager Wu and Secretary-General Ren giving speeches one after another, explaining the importance of jointly promoting sales and developing production. The company's construction plan for national goods stipulates that cooperation in sales and production is the first step, cooperation in production and economy is the second step, and cooperation in economy and talent is the third step. Assisting various regions in establishing national goods companies is the basic work for implementing the plan. The purpose of this work is to create sales power and transform commercial organizations, gradually progressing to complete a commercial alliance. Therefore, the company attaches great importance to the establishment of the Nanjing National Goods Company. It is now heard that the company has determined to invest 10,000 yuan in the Nanjing National Goods Company and, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the company's articles of association and the first category of organizational principles, raise 10,000 yuan in shares on its behalf. The board of directors greatly admires the company's spirit and has unanimously decided to increase the capital to 100,000 yuan. The directors present at the meeting have already subscribed to 2,000 yuan in shares, totaling 54,000 yuan. The remaining 26,000 yuan will be raised by newly appointed directors and the committee. It has been agreed that April 30 will be the deadline for collecting the funds, and Zhang Mengwen, Zhuang Xianglin, Chen Chuqiao, Huang Cilun, and Fu Zhongfu, a representative of the municipal government, will be responsible for examining the status and price of the Taiping Road Samsung Company. It is expected that the realization of the Nanjing National Goods Company will be extremely rapid. The origin of the Nanjing National Goods Company is recorded below: "The China National Goods Production and Sales Joint Company Organizes the Origin of the Nanjing National Goods Company" Today's people only know that the Great Wall bleeds blood and the Shanghai-Shanghai war is a method of defending against the enemy, but they do not know that negotiating business and starting work, protecting the economy, are also strategies for seeking strength and preparedness. When two countries compete, the enemy is strong and we are weak, the enemy exerts all its strength and we are not of one mind, then retreat is advance, and the strategy of alliance can be used as a lesson for ten years of education and training. We must endure and be able to struggle, suffer and know how to prepare, and then we can talk about revenge and save the country. This company is based on the principle of production self-rescue and engages in the construction of industrial and commercial enterprises. The reason why it engages in the construction of industrial and commercial enterprises is to expand the scope of life, resist the invasion of foreign goods, and enable the economy of the people to circulate and support themselves. If they can support themselves, they can talk about education, and then the teachings of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and the way of self-improvement, can be widely practiced without hindrance. When this company was first established, Mayor Shi deeply knew that governing commerce was the forerunner of starting work. After implementing the movement to promote national goods, he followed up with the suggestion to establish the Nanjing National Goods Company, and the municipal government purchased 10,000 yuan in shares to encourage it. The company's responsibilities lie in complying with the municipal government's encouragement, and the first board meeting decided, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 4 and 30 of the company's articles of association, to allocate 10,000 yuan to establish the preparatory committee for organizing the Nanjing National Goods Company. It has also obtained the consent of Minister Chen and Mayor Shi to serve as the directors of the preparatory committee, leading the recruitment of shares, so that the proposal for the Nanjing National Goods Company can be realized as soon as possible, in order to conform to the true meaning of promoting national goods and meet the needs of the people to protect them. If government officials and ladies in Beijing can support them without doing small things, then not only the establishment of the Nanjing National Goods Company will be a matter of time, but also the proposal for chain stores, the transformation of commercial organizations, and the ideal of a joint industrial and commercial alliance can all be expected to be realized. This special narrative describes its origin and attaches the articles of association for raising shares, hoping for public consideration.</p>

<p>Methods Are Being Drafted</p>
<p>According to reliable information from the communications sector, Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua believes that wired telegraph bureaus and wireless radio stations are both state-owned electrical communications agencies and should not be separated. He has always advocated for a merger. Communications personnel also believe that the merger is a crucial plan and express their sympathy. Moreover, since postal and telecommunications have already been combined in one place, and wireless and wired have the same nature, it is even more inappropriate to separate and govern separately. Therefore, in order to realize the new plan of merging wireless and wired as soon as possible, the Electrical Affairs Department of the Ministry is actively drafting regulations, and the department in charge of electrical affairs has sent circulars to the responsible personnel of telegraph bureaus and wireless radio stations in various places, instructing them to immediately submit their opinions on the implementation methods for reference.</p>

<p>Difficult to Profit, Cancel the Car Force Competition</p>
<p>Workers Oppose and Will Use Strikes to Deal With It</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Chinese customs declaration industry has been severely affected by the establishment of customs declaration firms by Japanese merchants in Shanghai and the reduction of freight rates to attract business. The customs declaration firms of the Tianjin gang have canceled the car force, which has aroused the workers' reaction. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e145">Customs Declaration by Japanese Merchants <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Customs declaration workers once experienced a strike due to the cancellation of the traditional cartage fees by various cotton fabric businesses. Fortunately, the strike was resolved after mediation by party and government authorities, and the cartage fees were handled as usual. Now, it is reported that Chinese-owned customs brokerages in the Tianjin business community are suffering because Japanese merchants have established customs brokerages in Shanghai, such as Pingqia, to solicit customs declarations and disrupt the established cartage fee practices. Initially, they only handled Japanese goods, but now they are arbitrarily reducing fees and soliciting packaging business. Merchants from various Tianjin business groups are taking advantage of their low prices and using their services, significantly impacting the business of Chinese customs brokerages.</p>

<p>Chinese customs brokerages are struggling to profit due to the competitive impact of the Japanese customs brokerages. To maintain their operations, they will also reduce freight charges and abolish cartage fees starting this year to compete with Japanese merchants. The first to implement this is Yufengsheng Customs Brokerage, and other firms such as Fuji are following suit. The profit margin per item has become very small.</p>

<p>Customs declaration workers from the Tianjin business community oppose the Tianjin business community and customs brokerages for disrupting established practices and abolishing cartage fees, which has severely impacted their livelihoods. They have collectively protested and petitioned the Municipal Party Department's Social Affairs Bureau for assistance. They are also holding meetings to discuss countermeasures and, if necessary, will resort to strikes against customs brokerages that disrupt the cartage fee system. The Social Affairs Bureau has already begun mediation, and the Customs Brokerage Association will hold a general meeting in the coming days to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>Japanese goods, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and general merchandise, have experienced a significant decrease in sales in various parts of South China due to the boycott by the Chinese people. However, they are still being sold as usual in various parts of North China. According to sources in the customs declaration industry, eight or nine out of ten goods handled by merchants from the Tianjin business community are Japanese goods. It is reported that in recent days, North China steamships transporting Japanese goods to Tianjin and other places have been carrying two to three thousand items daily, mostly on Japanese ships.</p>

<p>For Muslims, performing the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) is the highest honor. Those who cannot personally perform the Hajj must perform ablutions and prayers in local mosques on the seventieth day after Ramadan each year, which is traditionally called the Lesser Eid. Yesterday morning, at ten mosques in Shanghai, Muslims gathered to perform ablutions and change clothes. At 9:30 AM, they prayed devoutly and then personally performed Qurbani (sacrificing livestock such as cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks), giving gifts to relatives and friends in the community and donating to the poor Muslims. It is said that Muslims around the world perform this same grand ritual.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Municipal Council Regarding Agency for Land Goods Industry Donation and License Fees <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>And Requests that the Fee Remains at Two Dollars per Quarter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday stating, "To whom it may concern, on the 24th of this month, we received a letter from our member Land Goods Industry Association stating that the council had previously forced members of their industry to donate to obtain licenses. After repeated negotiations, the council replied that it was not convenient to approve the exemption from the donation, but the license fee was reduced to two dollars per quarter, as stated in your council's letter No. 345 of the Puzi series of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Now, the Municipal Council has sent personnel to collect the license fee from various firms in the industry, increasing the fee by four dollars per license without explaining the reason for the increase. The personnel of various firms in our association, not being literate in foreign languages, assumed that the fee was calculated on a semi-annual basis, so they all paid the fee. Later, they learned that it was a quarterly donation fee, and they have petitioned the association to negotiate with the Municipal Council to continue collecting the fee at the original amount. We have found that the Municipal Council's change to the previously determined donation amount and its sudden collection from various firms in the industry seems to be a breach of contract. To avoid disputes, our association will not retroactively recover the increased license fee for the previous quarter. Starting this summer, the fee will be paid at the original amount. We are afraid that there will be further increases in the future. It is now proposed that the quarterly license fee to be paid by various firms in the industry should be collected by our association, and we request that your council forward it to the Municipal Council, and the council should issue licenses for each firm to our association for distribution. We respectfully request that the council not increase the fee, so as to comply with the original plan and avoid disputes. We would be deeply grateful. Enclosed is a list of the names of various firms donating licenses and seventy-two dollars for the summer donation of licenses. We are sending this letter to request that you forward it to the Municipal Council and ask the council to instruct the donation office to count the money and issue the licenses. This is our sincere request. Furthermore, due to preliminary issues in this session, we are directly negotiating with your council. Once the two proposed methods of the association have been negotiated and agreed upon, our association can directly send a letter to the donation office regarding future license matters."</p>

<h3 id="e157">Sichuan Survey Group of the Engineering Society to Depart on Schedule <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>丨Departing from Shanghai on April 15th丨</p>
<p>The sole purpose of this trip is to seek the welfare of Sichuan</p>
<p>Working in groups to conduct thorough investigations and research</p>
<p>Liu Fucheng (Xiang), the Military Governor of Sichuan, has repeatedly thwarted bandit forces since his command to suppress the Sichuan bandits, and success is expected soon. In order to develop production and construction, he telegraphed the Shanghai Chinese Engineering Society last year to conduct a survey in Sichuan. The society believed that Sichuan and Tibet were rich in resources and urgently needed to be surveyed in order to develop them. They immediately carefully hired specialists and organized the Sichuan Survey Group. Fortunately, with the sincere cooperation of all parties, preparations are nearing completion, and it has been decided that they will depart on April 15th. Hu Shuhua, the President of Hunan University in Changsha, will serve as the head of the group.</p>
<p>Details are pre-announced as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e158">Purpose of Departure <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Engineering Society, in view of the upcoming departure of the survey group, has specially notified each group member of the purpose of the departure, the work to be undertaken, and the matters related to the group members' travel expenses. (1) Purpose of Departure: Although some members of this group serve in government agencies, this trip is purely to fulfill their national duty and contribute their knowledge and experience to seek the welfare of China and Sichuan. There is absolutely no other political meaning or effect. The members of this group do not represent the agencies to which they belong. Although some members of this group come from the industrial and commercial sectors, the purpose of this trip is not to promote their private business or sell their goods. Developing Sichuan is a way to save the country. Although people from other provinces can participate in Sichuan's undertakings, due to geographical relations, Sichuan should still be the main entity. People from other provinces are only willing to play a supporting role. The central government and local governments should cooperate closely, but the central government will never compete with local governments for power and profit. Our society is an academic organization and only knows how to serve, and has no rights to speak of. The above three points can be explained at any time in Sichuan to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Group Work <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Chongqing or Chengdu, the members of each group will work in groups. Their itineraries will not interfere with each other, but they must report to the head of the group, who will schedule the itinerary for each group. The members of each group should collect materials in advance for the issues they are responsible for. After entering Sichuan, they should quickly contact and liaise with the local person in charge, inquire about the difficulties, and conduct thorough investigations and research. If there are proposals, they must be carefully discussed at the group meeting before they are submitted. Do not act alone. If a decision cannot be made, it is okay to say so directly, and it is not appropriate to be perfunctory. The head of this group was originally Mr. Sa Fujun, the president of the society. Because President Sa is traveling to the Americas, Director Hu Shuhua has been recommended to take over. The representative of the Sichuan side who is in charge of all the affairs of the survey group is Mr. Gan Diankui, the Director of Political Affairs (stationed in Chongqing).</p>
<h3 id="e160">Group Members' Travel Expenses <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The departure from China is scheduled for April 14th or 15th, departing from Shanghai. Nanjing and Hankou can also stop to pick up members of the group who are boarding in Beijing and Hankou. The exact date and name of the ship will be notified later. The average travel expenses for each member of the group (one person is already in Sichuan) are estimated at 1,000 yuan, all of which will be borne by the Sichuan Post-Disaster Rehabilitation Office. Extra travel expenses for those departing from places other than Beijing, Hankou, and Shanghai can also be included in the calculation. The accounting affairs will be handled by a specialist appointed by the Bank of China commissioned by the office and will be under the command of the head of the group. (For the members' personal use, Sichuan Representative Fan Chongshi stationed in Beijing has been asked to send some money to each person when boarding the ship for emergencies, but each person should still bring some pocket money.) This trip to Sichuan is not for sightseeing.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is advisable not to bring family members.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Liaison Matters <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Assistants needed for investigation, survey, or measurement can be obtained by discussing with Political Affairs Director Gan Diankui and Loo Sak-fu, General Manager of Minsheng Industrial Company after arriving in Chongqing. All other issues can also be discussed with these two gentlemen. The China Western Academy of Sciences in Beibei, Chengdu University, and West China University can all provide research materials. Travel light for the spring season, but bedding must be brought. Servants do not need to be brought in order to maintain uniformity. The weather in inland Sichuan is warmer and the scenery is beautiful, so travelers will feel happy. The opium scourge in Sichuan is pervasive and deeply rooted, which is very sad. The group can take the opportunity to express their concerns to the authorities. Mr. Zhang Yujiu of the Bank of China in Sichuan is a man of heart, and his Sichuan Monthly magazine is worth noting. The magazine is available on the ship, so please read it. After arriving in Shanghai, members of the group can contact Mr. Zhang Shulin, Shanghai Manager of Minsheng Company at No. 16, O-zi, Jiujiang Road. Mr. Zhang has also decided to accompany them to Sichuan, so they can take care of each other along the way. Members of the group who are boarding the ship in Hankou must arrive in Hankou on April 15th and inquire about everything from Mr. Li Longzhang of Minsheng Branch Company at No. 2, Dingan Lane. If members of the group have any questions before boarding the ship, please contact Yun Zhen of the Construction Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e162">List of Group Members <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>

<h3 id="e163">Standard for Passengers Kidnapped on the Yisheng Wheel <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Those with fair and tender arms and wrinkle-free feet</p>
<p>Are Considered by Bandits to be Wealthy and Honored</p>
<p>Even the Poor Are Considered Rich</p>
<p>The Yisheng Wheel is Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The Yisheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson was hijacked on the 12th of this month in the waters off Fuzhou, and six passengers were taken away. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The details heard are supplemented as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e164">Hell Money Attracts Covetous Pirates <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The hijacking of the Yisheng Wheel was caused by three boxes of hell money loaded on the ship. The pirates mistook the hell money for real currency, so when the 22 pirates took action on the 12th, they asked the crew for the money. The crew told them that what was loaded was hell money, not silver coins, but the bandits had already taken action and searched all the passengers on the ship.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Twenty-Two Pirates with Seven Guns <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The pirates who hijacked the Yisheng Wheel spoke with a complete Huizhou accent. There were a total of twenty-two people, and they only brought seven guns on board. They searched the ship for a total of sixteen or seventeen hours, and the total amount of cash they looted, including from the crew and passengers, was only about 5,000 yuan. Each pirate received about 200 yuan, but some received two shares and some only received half a share, depending on their status among the bandits. Because there was not much cash, they kidnapped passengers.</p>
<h3 id="e166">No News of Six Hostages <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>At that time, the bandits detained 17 passengers on the ship for them to choose to kidnap. The bandits kidnapped passengers based on their clothes and limbs. Those with fair arms and wrinkle-free feet were considered to be wealthy and honored people. Six people were taken away on the spot, including two passengers surnamed Pan from Nanjing, one passenger each surnamed Cheng and Chen, and two others, Zhang Boyu, a shop assistant from the Huashangtai Company, and Zhang Xiting, who had been unemployed for more than ten years. They were all poor people with no family wealth, and their whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Lu Xuefang's Quick Wit <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>When comprador Lu Xuefang heard of the robbery at 5:00 AM on the 12th, he disguised himself as a stoker and walked out of the cabin door. He met a bandit who wanted to go to the captain's room but did not know the way. Lu falsely agreed to lead him to a ladder, and then took the opportunity to escape into the coal bunker. He hid in the coal for 36 hours. The bandit leader searched for Lu everywhere and offered a reward of 300 yuan for Lu on the ship. Fortunately, a teaboy told the bandits that Lu had jumped into the sea and drowned. The bandits finally gave up. With his quick wit, Lu was not kidnapped.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Xu's Case Dismissed on Appeal <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yuying Petitions for Restoration</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the High Court Dismisses the Request</p>
<p>In the case of Ji Juemi, the chief manager of Hadong, being sued for seducing Xu Yuying, a young girl from Ningbo, after the first instance trial by the First Special District District Court, Ji Juemi was found not guilty. The plaintiffs, Xu Li Shi and Xu Yuying, were unwilling to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. When the court scheduled the trial for the afternoon of the 20th of last month, the appellant did not appear because she had applied to the Supreme Court for a transfer of jurisdiction. Subsequently, her application was rejected by the Supreme Court. The Second Branch of the High Court then set the afternoon of March 12th as the date for the retrial and ordered the police to summon them to Xu's mother and daughter's residence at No. 13, Daodali Road, Beile Road, in the French Concession. However, they still did not appear on the scheduled date. On the one hand, they petitioned for a postponement of the trial on the grounds that Xu Yuying was ill, so the court could not be opened again that day. Later, after the criminal court president Yu Hua and the jurors Zhao Zheng Tang, Zhou Han, and Jiang presented it for review, they believed that the appellant was deliberately delaying the case. The lawsuit had been legally served, but they still repeatedly avoided interrogation. Therefore, on the 17th of this month, they ruled to dismiss the appeal and posted the ruling on the court's notice board, as Xu's residence address in the petition was No. 13, Daodali Road, Beile Road, but the summons and other documents sent there were not received. After the announcement, Xu Li Shi and Xu Yuying submitted a petition to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting the revocation of the ruling to "dismiss the appeal" and the restoration of the case. After Judge Yu and jurors Zhao and Zhou considered the matter, they found that their request had no merit and rejected it on the 24th. The Ji Xu lawsuit, which had been widely publicized and attracted attention throughout the city, now seems to be coming to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Major Disturbance in District Four Over Crackdown on Vegetable Stalls on Jingjiang Road <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>District Officials and Stallholders Injured in Clashes</p>
<p>Shops on Gonghe Xin Road Go on Strike</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Public Security Bureau of District Four of Zhabei dispatched police to crack down on vegetable stalls along Jingjiang Road and arrested ten people. Stallholders went to the police station to petition, causing a disturbance. District official Ouyang Liu was injured in the clash, and some stallholders were also injured. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e170">History of the Stalls <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>In the area north of the railway on Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, there have long been poor people from Jiangbei setting up vegetable stalls to earn a meager income to make a living. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Yang Dexing petitioned the municipal government to organize the Daxing Company to purchase land and build a cement vegetable market at the intersection of Zhongxing Road, charging each stallholder six jiao. For a time, the stalls were quite crowded. Subsequently, the fees continued to increase to two yuan, so many stallholders were unable to pay. They then set up stalls on the wasteland along Jingjiang Road, and the stallholders in the vegetable market became increasingly scarce, and business was very slow. They then petitioned the Public Security Bureau to crack down on hawkers along the road and force them to move in, but most stallholders, having survived the war and the great fire after the war, were unable to pay the donation, so they refused to return to the vegetable market.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Dispatching Police to Crack Down <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Lai Gang, the Director of the Public Security Bureau of District Four, believed that the stalls along the road violated police regulations and ordered district official Ouyang Liu of the Zhongxing Road Police Station to dispatch police to drive them away. On the 17th of this month, he arrested nine stallholders and sent them to the General Public Security Bureau for interrogation. As a result, five people were sentenced to imprisonment and were released a few days ago. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the district official dispatched more than ten policemen to Jingjiang Road to drive away all the stallholders, but the stallholders refused to obey, resulting in a conflict. The police then detained ten of the ringleaders and took them back to the police station for detention.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Disturbance Occurs <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The stallholders were panicked by the police station's arrest of ten stallholders. They gathered three or four hundred stallholders, old and young, and went to the Zhongxing Road District Four Police Station to petition, demanding immediate release, otherwise they would not leave. For a time, a conflict occurred due to misinterpretation of words. Some people threw stones, smashing the windows and glass of the police station, and the order was quite chaotic. The police chief, seeing the situation, dispatched police to drive them away, but to no avail. He also called the Director of the Public Security Bureau of District Four for instructions. Lai Gang, upon hearing the news, immediately led more than 20 policemen to suppress the situation, but the crowd still did not disperse. He then telegraphed the General Public Security Bureau to dispatch more than 20 machine gun team members to assist in the dispersal, which was successful.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Persuading to Open the Market <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The shops along Gonghe Xin Road from the railway north to Zhongxing Road, seeing this situation, went on strike around 11:00 AM at noon. In the afternoon, Lai Gang, the District Chief of District Four, personally led the police to persuade each household to open the market. Although a small number of shops opened for business in the evening, most were still closed.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Injured Police and Civilians <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Afterwards, reporters rushed to investigate the injuries of police and civilians. The situation is as follows: Ouyang Liu, a Fourth District officer, suffered severe injuries to his waist, a broken nose and bleeding, and a black eye. He was taken to the Bao Long Hospital for treatment. Police officers Chen Huamin, Zhou Qingjun, Fan Caisheng, Cai Chongting, Zhu Lizhao, and others were also injured and sent to the Second Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society for treatment. On the side of the stallholders, the injured included Madam Yang, 54 years old, from Jiangbei, and Madam Li Xu, 79 years old, two elderly people from Jiangbei, who both had head injuries and were sent to the Red Cross by the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. Zhu Nianhui, 29 years old, from Jiangbei, suffered a head injury. Others such as Madam Zhang Song, 55 years old, Madam Qin Zhao, 51 years old, Madam Yang Yao, 57 years old, and Madam Zhu Lou, 24 years old, suffered minor injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Ten People Sent to the Bureau <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, the ten stall vendors initially detained, namely Zhang Guyu, Zhang Rongfu, Madam Zhou Song, Yang Yao, Madam Xing Cao, Zhu Lianyuan, Madam Zhu Xu, Chen Shuicai, Li Xu, and Madam Zhu Yang, were sent to the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau by the Fourth District yesterday afternoon for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Rushing to Investigate <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters, upon receiving a report that shops along Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei had gone on strike, requested prompt action. After receiving the report, the headquarters immediately dispatched Investigation Section Director Zhang Yunzeng, General Manager Lu Yuanhu, together with Civil Affairs Section General Manager Zhang Sheng, Secretary Lu Yinchu, and others to rush to investigate the truth in order to assist in handling the situation. Furthermore, the Public Security Bureau also dispatched an Inspector-General and police officers yesterday to rush to investigate and ensure fair handling of the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Reporting the Incident <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Zhongxing Road Police Station, after the incident, immediately submitted a written report to the Fourth District, which was forwarded to the Municipal Government Public Security Bureau. The original text reads: Regarding the matter of reporting, at 8:30 AM today, Police Chief Li of the Machine Gun Squad led police officers to crack down on vegetable stalls on Jingjiang Road. The stall vendors not only refused to comply with the crackdown but also injured police officers Chen Jimin, Zhou Qingjun, Fan Caisheng, Cai Chongting, and Zhu Lizhao. Upon seeing the injured officers, Police Chief Li immediately arrested the ringleaders Zhang Jinzhen, Zhu Lianyuan, Zhang Chengfu, and others, and took them to the station. When they arrived at the intersection of Gonghe Xin Road and Zhongxing Road, several hundred vegetable stallholders seized one shell gun from police officer Chen Jimin. The gun was later recovered with the assistance of soldiers from the Second Squad of the Security Team, but the gun belt was torn. When I heard the news and was about to dispatch more police officers to maintain order, three or four hundred people suddenly arrived and surrounded the police station, destroying all the furniture, doors, windows, bedding, office equipment, and other items inside. They then grabbed and beat me, tearing my uniform and causing me serious injuries. Then, they dragged me away. When we reached Datong Road and Zhongxing Road, fortunately, the district patrol arrived and rescued me. I found that several police officers from the gun squad had been injured and immediately sent them to the Second Hospital of the Red Cross for treatment. Several police officers at the station suffered minor injuries, and cook Hu Jinshan injured his leg. Most of the uniforms were torn, and two Russian-made gun mechanisms, two rubber raincoats, and one Bailinglin gun were snatched away. 46 yuan in silver dollars and one gold watch that I carried with me were also snatched away. The police station is currently investigating the items lost by the station chief. After a detailed investigation, I will report again. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Detailed Account of Westerner Julian's Suicide <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Girlfriend Unsuccessful in Suicide Attempt After Taking Poison Last Night</p>
<p>His Life Story Was Truly Remarkable</p>
<p>Last week, a suicide case occurred at the Astor House Hotel on the Bund. A foreigner claiming to be a British Canadian named (C.C. Julian) Cecil Julian died after taking poison. In addition, his girlfriend (Leonora.Levy) Leonora Levy also attempted suicide by taking poison, but fortunately, she was rescued and her life was saved. It has been found that Julian was wanted by the US government and had not yet been brought to justice. The crimes he committed during his lifetime were quite shocking. The findings of the investigation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e179">Julian and Levy's Backgrounds <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Julian was a British Canadian. His origin was in Willow Creek, Canada. He came to Shanghai in March of last year. Julian's business in the United States had failed. After being sued and arrested in court, he seized the opportunity of being released on bail and secretly came to Shanghai. Julian was 48 years old. He had a wife, two daughters, and a brother named Cecil Julian in his hometown. His brother was also recently sued in the United States, but was ultimately granted probation. Julian's business in the United States was enormous. He served as the president of the Julian Petroleum Corporation. The company's capital reached 100 million, but the result was that the oil mining yielded no results. As a result, the company declared bankruptcy, and Julian was sued by many people, accused of being a huge swindler. Therefore, his past history was well-known to people throughout the United States. As for Ms. Levy, who did not succeed in committing suicide, she was a close friend of Julian. It was rumored that she was Julian's secretary, which has been denied. Ms. Levy had been living in Shanghai. Her father, Gotonberg, was in the film business in Shanghai. However, in 1925, he was murdered in the Victoria Theatre. Her mother was British and remarried soon after. Levy took her stepfather's surname and was only nineteen years old. She was a beautiful and charming young woman.</p>

<p>Julian's suicide occurred at about 9:00 PM on Saturday of last week, in room 300 of the Astor House Hotel where Julian resided. At about 8:00 PM that evening, Julian and Levy came in together from outside, looking very tired. The waiter served them dinner, but Julian did not eat. At about 9:00 PM, a woman's crying was suddenly heard in the room. The waiter entered and learned that Julian had committed suicide by taking poison. He was rushed to a doctor for treatment and sent by car to Hong En Hospital on Great Western Road. However, he had taken too much poison and died at 1:00 AM. Ms. Levy also went with him at the time. Seeing this situation, she left the hospital and went to the residence of David Baker on Avenue Joffre to rest. At 6:30 AM, she went out. At 9:15 AM, Levy suddenly collapsed while borrowing a telephone at a pharmacy at No. 1703 Jing'an Temple Road, unconscious. She was sent to Hong En Hospital by car. A bottle of Amytal pills was found next to her, indicating that she had also taken poison. She was given treatment, and fortunately, the amount of poison was small. She gradually regained consciousness, and her life is now safe. However, she is still very weak, so she is still being treated at Hong En Hospital.</p>

<p>Julian, who committed suicide, was initially a clothing salesman. Because he was talented, he later suddenly engaged in the oil mining business. Although he failed several times, he was able to rise again by virtue of his eloquence. Years ago, he reorganized the Julian Petroleum Corporation. The initial capital was only 30 million, but he gradually increased it to 100 million through publicity methods. Unexpectedly, the oil mines dug in the western United States yielded no results, so he declared bankruptcy. More than 15,000 people were affected. As a result, many people sued Julian. The court in Ardmore, Oklahoma, also charged Julian with two counts of fraud and embezzlement and arrested him. However, he was released on bail of $25,000. Julian seized this opportunity to escape from Ardmore to Vancouver, and from Vancouver to Shanghai. At that time, the US authorities offered a reward of $3,000 for his arrest. However, because Julian claimed to be Canadian and was under British protection, the US consulate in Shanghai intended to extradite him, but failed due to the opposition of the British consulate.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Using the Hotel as Home Due to Knowing Levy <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>When Julian first came to Shanghai, he stayed at the Palace Hotel. At the end of last year, he moved into the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. But two weeks later, he moved to a Western apartment on Carter Road. At that time, his bedroom was next to Ms. Levy's, so they got to know each other. Julian was very down on his luck in Shanghai, but he once worked as the general manager of a stock brokerage firm on the Continental Building. Ms. Levy also worked there. However, Julian suddenly resigned in early February of this year, and Ms. Levy also left her job. Two days before the suicide, Julian suddenly moved to room 300 of the Astor House Hotel. Ms. Levy, on the other hand, moved to the David's Hotel on Saturday of last week, which was also reserved by Julian in advance. It is said that Levy had just arrived from Hankou. Who knew that this tragedy would happen that evening?</p>
<h3 id="e183">Speculation About the Cause of Death is Widespread <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>There are various rumors about Julian's suicide. Some say that because the US president recently approved an important bill, all American fugitives, if their place of residence is in an area where the US government enjoys extraterritorial rights, can be extradited. Therefore, Julian would have no foothold in Shanghai, so he committed suicide. Others say that Julian's business failure was certain, and he did not bring much capital with him when he came to Shanghai. Recently, he had been in dire straits. He had attempted suicide once two weeks ago, but was discovered by a friend and failed. Recently, he had shown signs of pessimism and had written a special autobiography, saying that when people reach the end of their road, they begin to understand the psychology of those who commit suicide. His desire to commit suicide did not start today. As for Ms. Levy's suicide, it was due to her emotional connection with Julian.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Authorities Begin to Investigate <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Since the case has been started being investigated by the British Assessor's Office in this port. After Julian's body was sent to the morgue on Fearon Road, British Coroner Maurice went to examine it and held a preliminary hearing. The hearing was adjourned until 2:00 PM this Thursday. The only person related to the case is Ms. Levy. The British authorities originally intended to question her, but because Ms. Levy's health had not recovered, they decided to postpone it. The authorities have also begun investigating Julian's estate. According to the investigation, he has nothing, so Julian's suicide is also greatly related to economic problems.

<p>The Thief Fired Four Shots, None of Which Hit</p>
<p>The Thief's Corpse Lies in a Busy Street, His Death is Very Tragic</p>
<p>At 7:01 PM last night, a robbery occurred on Min Ti Ni Yin Road, north of the Chu Family Bridge, in the French Concession. The victim followed the thieves closely in pursuit. Multiple Chinese and Vietnamese constables along the way, as well as Chinese constables on duty in the Chinese district, surrounded and arrested the thieves from all sides. The robbers opened fire to resist arrest, and as a result, one thief was shot and killed on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e186">Four Thieves Break In <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Xu Zhishan, from Yangzhou, specializes in buying old stamps. He married a woman named He and rented a residence at No. 31, Lane 7, Jin Yu Li, north of the Chu Family Bridge on Min Ti Ni Yin Road in the French Concession. At 7:01 PM last night, Xu had just finished his work and returned home, preparing to have dinner, when suddenly four robbers broke in from outside the door. One thief stood guard outside the door, while three thieves rushed in, took out pistols, and threatened them to remain silent.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Secretly Following <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>After entering the house, the robbers went into the hall and rooms to search as they pleased, and locked Xu and He in a room. As a result, they robbed a gemstone ring, a gold bracelet, and 16 yuan in cash. After obtaining the loot, the robbers fled in a hurry. At that time, Xu witnessed the robbers all escaping together, so he mustered his courage and followed them secretly. The thieves turned south then east, from Rue P. Henry straight into the Chinese district's Xiaobeimen and up to Wanzhu Street.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Four Shots Miss <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>When Xu reached Wanzhu Street, he secretly reported the crime to Constable No. 1309 from the First Section of the Second District Police Station, who assisted in the pursuit. When they reached Qinglian Street, one of the thieves noticed them and quickly turned around to open fire to resist arrest, firing four shots in succession. Fortunately, none of them hit. The constable, because there were many passersby, was afraid of injuring the innocent, so he did not return fire. Seeing that the situation was not good, the thief fled across the Chinese district's Minguo Road from Dajing Street and then back into the French Concession's Milu Road.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Bullet Hits the Thief Leader <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>At that time, police whistles sounded everywhere. Two Vietnamese constables, Nos. 260 and 466, and Chinese constable No. 601, happened to be on duty there. Hearing the alarm, they all came to meet and pursue the thief. The thief desperately rushed past the three constables, turned north at the Nanyang Bridge iron gate, and re-entered Min Ti Min Yin Road. The three constables then raised their guns together and concentrated their fire on the thief. Chinese constable No. 601 fired two shots in succession, neither of which hit. Finally, Vietnamese constable No. 260 shot the thief in the head with a rifle.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Killed on the Spot <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The thief was hit by the bullet and immediately fell at the entrance of the Shengda Wood Company at No. 391. The three constables rushed forward together and captured him, but they saw that the bullet had entered from the back of his head and pierced his mouth, with his brains splattered. He was already dead. A live pistol containing three bullets was abandoned on the ground. The thief was wearing a light blue Chinese silk cotton robe and rubber running shoes. At the same time, the police had heard the news and dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene. They carried the thief's body into the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall to prepare the corpse for examination at the Second Special Court today.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Murder Case Over Five Yuan Rent Results in Sentencing <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Li Zhongxian Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Rong Laosan, a man from Menghe, lived in the overhanging building in the redwood workshop opened by Chen Yonglin on Zijin Street in the city. Because land in Shanghai is expensive, he tried to save rent, so he built a mezzanine in this small room and rented it to Li Zhongxian, a Shandong man who sold pancakes, for five yuan a month. However, because Li owed rent and did not pay it, and Rong was unwilling to suffer losses, they had a quarrel in the early morning of the day of the incident. When Li returned home in the evening, Rong was already asleep. Li went to the mezzanine and drank alone, and when he thought of the events of the day, he cursed loudly. Rong responded from the bed, and they exchanged insults. Li became even more angry and grabbed a sharp knife, climbed down from the mezzanine, and carried out the murder. At that time, Rong was sitting on the edge of the bed, holding his child and letting him urinate, because the child had woken him up. Li Zhongxian kicked open the door and rushed in. Rong saw him and quickly put down the child and tried to escape, but Li's knife had already pierced Rong's chest, hitting the Xuehai point below the nipple. After being injured, he immediately collapsed and died. Rong's wife stepped forward to stop him and was also stabbed in the finger. Li was about to flee when the owner of the redwood workshop called the police, who arrested Li and sent him to the Public Security Bureau, which transferred him to the Local Court. Li confessed to the murder, so the presiding judge reviewed the circumstances and found that the defendant had committed murder over a trivial matter and was extremely malicious. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Li Zhongxian was brought to court and sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of political rights to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Investigation of the House Collapse Case at Dayang Bridge Yesterday <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The fact that five people were killed or injured in the house collapse at the Zhongxing Huayi Factory on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei the night before last has been reported in the newspapers. Now it is learned that Li Qingjie, a patrol officer from the Taiyangmiao Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, led Police Chief Yang Jintang, Zhao Fangwen, and others yesterday morning to investigate and found that one of the deceased was Jin Taishan, and the other was Jin's wife, Pu, who had two daughters and one son. Except for the two daughters, who were injured and sent to the hospital, the son, who was about sixteen or seventeen years old, has not been found after repeated summons. Another deceased, Cai Bugao, had a son and daughter-in-law. The son was in Wusong, and his daughter-in-law went to Wusong to find her husband and has not returned. The cause of the house collapse was that there were many Jiangbei shacks behind the factory buildings, and most of the residents raised pigs. The shacks where Jin and Cai lived were close to the eaves of the factory building. A culvert, about a foot wide and four or five zhang long, was dug under the wall. After years of water accumulation, the soil loosened, causing the disaster. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the Local Court dispatched Prosecutor Xiao Jinying to the scene to examine the bodies. It was determined that they had been crushed to death before death. He ordered the families of the deceased to collect the bodies for burial on their own. If the families of the deceased refused to collect the bodies, the head of the Baojia would collect them for burial. It is also learned that the construction cost of the factory building was 1,200 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Special Commissioner Mei Shuzeng Departs for Sichuan to Investigate Industrial Construction <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan recently appointed Mr. Mei Shuzeng as a special commissioner to investigate industrial construction in Sichuan. After receiving the order, Mr. Mei believed that Sichuan has a vast land and abundant resources, and there are countless industries that need to be developed urgently, especially wool textiles, which are currently the most urgent need. Therefore, he went to North China to investigate the organization of wool textile factories in Tianjin and other places. He returned to Shanghai three days ago and is scheduled to go to Beijing last night, take a boat to Hankou, and then take a plane to Sichuan. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Mei at his residence yesterday. The following is a transcript of Mr. Mei's remarks: "Since I was appointed to investigate industrial construction in Sichuan, I have deeply felt that the mission is very important. Sichuan has always been known as the 'Land of Abundance,' with abundant resources and a large population. Its products supply many to the entire country, and the consumption of the people is also large. In terms of industrial construction, the future holds endless hope. Sichuan produces a lot of wool, and the quality is also good. At present, in addition to cotton and silk fabrics, the demand for wool fabrics is gradually increasing. I have long had the intention of establishing a wool textile industry in Sichuan. Therefore, when I was in Shanghai, I repeatedly visited wool textile factories such as Huazhang. This time, I was ordered to make another trip to North China to visit various wool textile factories in the north to prepare for the establishment of a wool textile enterprise in Sichuan. As for other products in Sichuan, they are too numerous to mention, such as medicinal materials, tung oil, silk, and sugar, all of which are very large. In the past, Sichuan's imports and exports often had a surplus, but since 19, a deficit has gradually appeared. At present, the annual deficit is about 10 million yuan or more. This is due to the national and even the world's economic decline, but it is also inexcusable that the responsibility of personnel has not been fully organized. In the past, Sichuan was often troubled, and there was no talk of developing any industry. Recently, Chairman Liu unified the military and government, and worked hard to govern. With this excellent opportunity, starting to develop industries should not be delayed any longer. Moreover, in the wake of our country's weakness and foreign insults, to strengthen ourselves, we must revitalize industry. The most promising place is Sichuan. Sichuan is Sichuan for the whole of China. Developing Sichuan's industry is the foundation for revitalizing China. However, relying solely on the strength of the people of Sichuan is certainly not enough. What I hope for is that the national economic community, in view of the need to develop Sichuan's industry, will rise up and work together to achieve great results. Many industrialists from other provinces do not understand the situation in Sichuan and are often hesitant. Now, these ideas are gradually changing. The news community's investigation group went to Sichuan first, followed by the engineers' investigation group. These two groups, standing as third parties, should be able to see the truth of Sichuan and introduce it to the whole country, and arouse the interest of the Chinese people in developing Sichuan's industry. This is fortunate for the people of Sichuan and is also an essential plan for revitalizing the country. This time, I will do my best to investigate the current state of Sichuan's products and the hidden minerals, present them to the government, and publicize them to the people. I will also discuss plans with the Sichuan authorities to welcome investment from other provinces to save the country's economic decline. Sichuan is rich in minerals, especially oil. Exploration is already underway and drilling will begin soon. Our country's poverty is due to abandoning wealth on the ground. With concerted efforts, why worry about not being strong? The length of this trip is difficult to determine, but it will be measured by the task. I will do my utmost to fulfill the purpose entrusted by the authorities."</p>

<p>Recently, there have been quite a few British industrialists visiting China. When the Empress of Britain arrived in Shanghai last week, there were two British industrialists among the passengers. After staying in Shanghai for a few days, they are now heading north to visit Tianjin and Beijing. The business practices of these two are worth noting and emulating by our Chinese people. They are as follows: Sir Watte, born in 1885, is the chairman of Bolton Textile Co. Ltd., located in Liverpool, England. Throughout his life, he has felt the importance of industrial and scientific training, and he has specially sent his son to study textile engineering at the University of Leeds. He has also donated 20,000 pounds to the University of Leeds and two other universities for chairs, and has employed graduates from these universities in his company. Mr. Knauf is also traveling with Sir Watte and is one of the most famous businessmen in Yorkshire. He has a large wool spinning factory near Bradford and founded the British Wool Research Association. He has occupied a large part of the influence in the work after its establishment. The association's annual expenditure is between 20,000 and 30,000. The importance of its nature can be known.</p>

<p>The Women's Voice Society of this port, in order to celebrate its first anniversary and test the public's opinion on women greats, launched a women greats election last autumn. The deadline was 5:00 PM on December 29th, and a total of more than 1,700 votes were received. That evening, Huang Renzhi, Wu Xizhi, and other gentlemen were invited to supervise the counting of the votes at the Bankers' Association. The elected historical women greats were Hua Mulan, Qiu Jin, Wu Zetian, Qin Liangyu, and Lei Zu. The modern women greats were Soong Ching-ling, Xie Bingxin, Ding Ling, Liu Wang Liming, and He Xiangning. Everything has been recorded in previous newspapers. Now it is learned that the society has changed the prizes to a common marble memorial monument because the prepared prizes lacked public education. It has also invited modern art sculptors Teng Baiye, Li Zhongdao, and Liang Desuo to be the preparation committee. It has been heard that everything is ready. On the right side will be carved an ideal girl holding a torch in her hand, leading forward. The upper left corner will be inscribed with the four characters "Women's Role Models." The middle will be engraved with the names of the ten selected women greats. The lower left corner will write "Presented by the Women's Voice Society," and it will be carved by Mr. Teng Baiye. It is also heard that this gift will be completed by the end of this month and will be given to the most powerful organization in this city that promotes public education.</p>

<p>Our country is vast and rich in resources, especially in stone materials. However, the Chinese people often neglect to use these high-quality, beautiful stones. Mr. Yao Huasun, recognizing this, resolutely founded the China Stone Company in Qingdao and established a branch factory in Shanghai. Yesterday, Mr. Tao Guilin initiated an introduction to the construction industry, hosting a banquet at the Great Eastern Hotel at 6 PM to promote the recognition of domestic building stone materials. The guests filled the hall, creating a grand occasion. Mr. Tao delivered a speech, stating that the establishment of the Stone Company meets the needs of China's current construction industry and advocating for the use of domestic stone materials. Subsequently, Mr. Yao Huasun, the company's general manager, reported on the company's founding purpose and progress. Mr. Li Dachao from the Municipal Government also participated, expressing his enthusiasm for promoting domestic goods and delivering an inspiring and insightful speech. Other architects, including representatives from the Architectural Association, expressed their agreement and support. The company's exhibits included over 30 types of materials such as granite, jade Buddha stone, and marble. Besides building materials, there were also many exquisitely crafted art pieces on display, a dazzling array.

<p>Remarkable Results</p>
<p>Qingyun Industrial Factory, located at No. 12 Huacheng Road in the French Concession, has recently invented several types of Taishan brand foam fire extinguishers. The effectiveness was tested by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which adopted them as aids for provincial fire protection. Major factories have also tested and purchased them, all praising their significant effectiveness. Yesterday, the 25th, the Zhabei Third Section Fire Brigade conducted a large-scale public demonstration at the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Guangdong Road. Chinese and foreign attendees were present to observe, creating a crowded and lively scene. First, a wooden house was erected on an open space, surrounded by flammable materials, and gasoline was poured inside and ignited. The fire blazed intensely. When the Taishan brand foam fire extinguisher was used to spray foam, the fire was immediately extinguished (in just 35 seconds). Simultaneously, a large iron bucket filled with gasoline and several pounds of cotton yarn was ignited for demonstration, resulting in an even fiercer fire. Upon spraying the foam, the fire was completely extinguished (in 58 seconds). Chinese and foreign attendees unanimously praised the remarkable effectiveness, setting a new record for fire extinguisher performance and proving it to be a valuable tool for fire protection.</p>

<p>Zhu Gaoming Careless with Fire</p>
<p>Yu Hu's Life Lost Instantly</p>
<p>Yesterday at 1:25 AM, a fire broke out in the room of Zhu Gaoming, who lived in the attic of Ms. Qian Shui's residence, a Ningbo woman, at No. 194 Dajing Road, Nine Acres.

The Fire Brigade Joint Association sounded the alarm, and fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene with pump trucks to extinguish the fire. By around 2 AM, the fire was extinguished. During the blaze, the Second District First Precinct dispatched officers to maintain order and took Qian Shui, the landlady, for questioning. It was learned that the building was also occupied by Yu Renfu, Zhu Gaoming, Liu Baolian, and Ms. Xi Jin. At the time of the fire, everyone was asleep. When they awoke and realized the danger, the smoke was overwhelming, and the fire was raging, leaving them with no escape. Fortunately, the firefighters bravely rescued Chen, Zhu Gaoming's wife, their eldest daughter Jufeng, their second daughter Jindi, and Hu, Yu Renfu's wife. However, Yu Hu suffered severe burns to her head and face and died instantly. The other injured individuals were sent to a hospital for treatment. The police precinct notified the local area head to report to the Shanghai Local Court, requesting officials to investigate. The fire destroyed one building, without affecting others.</p>

<p>Effective Remedy for Throat Ailments: Since the beginning of spring this year, due to irregular weather patterns, throat ailments have become prevalent. Often, neglect leads to untreatable conditions. Although there are many throat specialists in Shanghai, the consultation fees are expensive, making it difficult for poor families to afford treatment. Recognizing this deeply, Mr. Zhao has acquired a type of natural throat-healing herb from his hometown. Over the years, he has gifted it to relatives and friends, and all who take it recover quickly. Through word of mouth, requests have been numerous. Now, to make it more accessible, he plans to widely distribute it to patients, charging a small fee of two yuan per box to cover the cost of the herbs. You can purchase it at Mr. Zhao's residence at No. 28 Songshan Road, French Concession. If truly impoverished, out of his desire to help the world, he will provide it free of charge upon request.</p>

<p>Minjiao Museum Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition: Mr. Chen Songchun, curator of the Shanghai Municipal Minjiao Museum, is promoting national culture by collecting numerous ancient and modern calligraphy and paintings at the museum starting January 1st. The works are divided into two sections for display. They include Cai Xiang's ancient post, Fang Huqing's ink dragon, and Li Zhihua's peony and bird paintings, all of which are excellent works. Visitors are extremely crowded, praising each other. The post includes "Litchi Records", "Tea Records", "Painting Jintang Records", and handwritten notes. Because of the changes in the mountains and the destruction of the tombs, this tablet has now been lost, so it is rarely seen. Fang's ink dragon cloud and mist use superb brushwork, and Li's peony and bird paintings are extremely rich and gorgeous, with birds facing each other, and the composition and coloring are top-notch. Both are from Wujin. How does Wujin's calligraphy and painting have such a unique advantage?</p>

<p>Since the last publication of Reading News, we have received many more letters this week. Many registered readers have indeed submitted reading plans to the library, and some have raised questions to discuss with this department. They all seem very active, which shows that this is entirely out of their own initiative, not passive or forced. Readers who have not communicated with this department for a long time in the past did not know our research procedures. Now that they understand, they will no longer require us to urge them. We are very satisfied with this phenomenon and hope that other readers who have not yet written will also take the initiative and not treat us here as a school, but recognize that this is our own business, and no one else is responsible; if there is dissatisfaction with our work, it can be criticized and pointed out as much as possible. Our work is entirely based on all readers. Only when everyone raises opinions can we move forward and our work progress. On our part, we will never be "ashamed" because of your criticism, nor will we be annoyed by too many letters. On the contrary, we will only be more careful and energetic. We are afraid that everyone will be indifferent, making it impossible for us to think of a way.</p>
<p>In addition, many readers want us to increase the length. We have the same hope as the readers, but there are two conditions: one is that the material must be rich, and we must have achievements worth reporting to the readers; the second is that it should not affect the length of other columns in this newspaper. This aspect depends on the work of you all to provide us with more materials, and on the other hand, this department should try its best to find ways.</p>
<h3 id="e209">This Week's Information <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>This week, we should report to you:</p>
<p>(1) This week, we have added fifteen more reading comrades. They are participating in the research of this department.</p>
<p>(2) The demand to meet with this department in person is very enthusiastic. They call to ask, which is very sincere. Our designated consultation time is from 2 to 5 PM every Sunday afternoon, unless there are special circumstances. However, to have a consultation, it is necessary to submit a written request, and after this department agrees, this department will send an appointment letter. This procedure must be followed.</p>
<p>(3) This week, we received three letters, all hoping that we could discuss and study practical problems. Of course, reading to understand practical life is what we and the readers hope for, so we published an article "How to Study the Northeast Problem", and we intend to talk more about it in the future, as long as you can raise questions with us.</p>
<p>(4) Because of your efforts, our work has increased, so in addition to adding staff, we have extended the working hours by two hours.</p>
<p>(5) Participation in the research in this city was originally limited to readers of this library. Because we were afraid that expanding the scope too much would result in nothing being accomplished, now out-of-town readers of this newspaper often write letters requesting to participate, with sincere words, making it really unbearable for us to refuse, so now we have decided to invite them to join.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Announcements <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>You often write letters asking us to publish a combined edition of reading questions and answers, and we have now started compiling and printing it. It is expected that it will be published before April 15th this year, with approximately 80,000 to 100,000 words. The price has not yet been determined, but it will not exceed the cost price by much.</p>
<h3 id="e211">New Book Introduction <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Recently, we bought a book called "Lectures on Economics" (written by Chen Maoyin, published by Beijing Hope Bookstore). This department feels that this book is worth introducing to you as an introductory reading material. Because it:</p>
<p>(1) It is a lecture style, and the writing style is simple, which suits Chinese tastes.</p>
<p>(2) It does not adhere to the narrative order of "Capital", but incorporates the development of economics after "Capital", allowing readers to gain a complete concept of economics.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to providing accurate explanations and narratives, it also criticizes various fallacies, which is the characteristic of this book. People who are generally infatuated with popular economics, or who know that it is a fallacy but do not know why, should all read this book. (However, whether this book is completely flawless, we cannot immediately draw a conclusion. Soon, this department will have a more detailed critique, and we hope that readers can also raise opinions after reading it)</p>
<h3 id="e212">Acknowledgments <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>In order to provide readers with discussion materials for practical problems, we have previously, with some embarrassment, sent letters to various famous magazine publishers, requesting donations. Now, we are grateful that they have given us face and sent many books and newspapers. In addition to including it in the thank-you note for the books and newspapers received by this library, we hereby give a general thank-you; and we hope that major newspapers and magazines will continue to provide generous donations.</p>

<p>(Havas News Agency, Manila, 26th) Japan wants to have athletes from the puppet state participate in the Far Eastern Games, but has been rejected.

Yamamoto and two Philippine representatives have departed for Shanghai. It is said that the Chinese side still opposes the participation of puppet athletes, but does not refuse to discuss the issue.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Yesterday's Jiangda Basketball: Fudan Heavily Defeated Chizhi <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>| Eighty-One to Thirty |</p>
<p>Central Defeated Guanghua</p>
<p>Thirty-Five to Twenty</p>
<p>Two matches were played in the Jiangda basketball tournament yesterday afternoon. Originally, Central was scheduled to play Guanghua at Guanghua, and Fudan was scheduled to play Chizhi at Chizhi University. However, due to heavy rain overnight, the outdoor courts could not be used, so both matches were moved to the Chinese Basketball Hall. As a result, (1) Central defeated Guanghua, thirty-five to twenty, (2) Fudan defeated Chizhi, eighty-one to thirty. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e221">Central Defeated Guanghua <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>In the match between Central and Guanghua, the scores were initially very close, with a difference of only two or three points. Central was in the lead all the way, maintaining this situation throughout. In the first half, Central won by seven points with a score of sixteen to nine. The situation in the second half was similar, and Central won with a score of thirty-five to twenty. This match was dull and uninteresting. Guanghua's strategy and formation became very disorganized later on, and their scores were mostly long shots, which were unexpected. Central was also unable to surprise and win, so the performance could not show its appealing points. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Central | Free Throws | Fouls | Guanghua | Free Throws | Fouls</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>Zhou Heming | 5 | 1 | 1 | 11 | Wang Tiaoyuan | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3</p>

<p>Fudan and Chizhi continued the battle, and the situation of this match changed dramatically. Fudan easily defeated Chizhi, which was as easy as turning their hands over. The performance was crisp and refreshing, without any procrastination. The offense and defense were good, and they were very skilled. The talents were also very average. Their victory over Chizhi was one attack after another, with no gaps. Fudan had thirty-five points, while Chizhi only had six points. The first half ended with a score of forty-seven to ten. In the second half, Fudan switched the entire team, and the situation became closer. In total, Fudan won a big victory with a score of eighty-one to thirty. Fudan's championship this year can be without any problems. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Fudan | Free Throws | Fouls | Chizhi | Free Throws | Fouls</p>

<p>Students from Leidian School Resort to Violence After Basketball Defeat</p>
<p>Zhou Mingzhang Escapes Through Window, Unharmed</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) During the provincial basketball championship organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang Public Stadium on the 17th of this month, in a match between the Leiming team and the Xiaodao team, referee Zhou Mingzhang called a foul. With the score at 12 to 45, the Leiming team suddenly claimed that the referee was being unfair and declared their withdrawal. The next day, another match was held at the stadium, and Zhou was again present as a referee. Dozens of military students from the Dianlei School (the Dianming team belongs to this school) suddenly began to criticize Zhou. Zhou retreated to the stadium's ball-borrowing room but was pursued to the door, which was then forced open, and the students rushed inside. Seeing the situation, Zhou quickly jumped out of a window and fled. After the incident, enthusiastic sports figures in the provincial capital expressed deep regret that such actions undermine the very purpose of promoting sports. Although Officer Wang of the Dianlei School offered a verbal apology and promised to punish those responsible, the other party believes that the school authorities should take full responsibility for handling the matter. As a result, the issue remains unresolved. Consequently, those serving as referees are now wary. It has also been reported that some participants have stated that unless the school takes appropriate measures and guarantees that similar incidents will not occur again, they will withdraw from any future competitions involving the school as a form of passive resistance.</p>

<p>Sino-British Wuzhou Scheduled for Finals</p>
<p>Yesterday morning's final rematch of the Kai Tai Cup saw Wuzhou face Kefade. Referee Shen Huichun was appointed, but due to rain the night before, the match was postponed. Yesterday, Mr. Shen did not appear, likely due to the drizzle the previous night. The match was originally scheduled for the football field, but due to the wet ground, the Sports Promotion Association was asked to relocate it to the baseball field. Cup sponsor Tu Kaitai personally served as referee. The match was highly competitive, as the outcome determined who would advance to the finals. The first half ended in a draw, with equal momentum. In the second half, Kefade scored first, and the ball often hovered in Wuzhou's territory. However, Kefade was unable to penetrate the defense, which could be attributed to bad luck. Ultimately, due to a weak backline, they conceded two goals in quick succession, ending the match with a score of 1-2, thus losing their chance to advance to the finals. Sino-British Wuzhou will face off in a best-of-three series, with the dates now scheduled as follows: (1) March 28, 6:30 PM, football field, referee Shen Huichun, linesmen National Huayang team captains; (2) April 8, 7:00 PM, baseball field, referee Le Xiurong, linesmen Tu Kaiyuan, Li Baojun.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Jiangning Experimental County Implements Compulsory Education <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Over the past year, Jiangning Autonomous Experimental County has made considerable progress in increasing the number of schools and improving educational methods. Recently, the county formulated and implemented measures for compulsory education in order to earnestly promote it. School-age children (ages six to nine), older out-of-school children (ages ten to fourteen), and adult out-of-school people (ages sixteen and above) are all required to attend school. School-age children must receive four years of compulsory education. Older out-of-school children enter short-term compulsory education classes for one year. Adult out-of-school people enter public schools for four months. Short-term classes and public schools both provide two hours of instruction each day. The scope of compulsory education is based on the districts designated by each school. To facilitate implementation, each school forms a compulsory education promotion committee composed of the principal, teachers, local education enthusiasts, and relevant heads of townships and police agencies. Before the start of each academic year, the committee investigates the children and adults within the school district who should receive compulsory education. Except for those who have received equivalent education at home, those who are extremely impoverished and forced to earn a living, and those who are unable to attend school due to illness or other unavoidable circumstances, all others are notified to attend school. If parents or guardians fail to ensure enrollment within one week of the school's opening (within three days for public schools), the committee will visit and persuade them. If they still fail to enroll, the school will notify the police agency to enforce compulsory enrollment or impose a fine for abandonment of education. The fine is submitted to the county government by the police agency and stored for use as a county-wide scholarship fund. The above measures were announced and implemented by the county government yesterday, further promoting compulsory education in Jiangning.</p>

<p>Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan Attends and Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Han Juemin, Lin Zhike, Huang Xianzhang, and Others Elected as Executive Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Professors and Writers Association, after a month of preparation, held its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon at the hall of the China Arts and Sciences Society. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Members: Professors and writers from various Shanghai universities, including Lin Zhike, Han Juemin, Zhu Zhangbao, Huang Xianzhang, Jiang Zhensan, Lu Yinquan, Meng Shouchun, Ouyang Xi, Wang Yuzhang, Zhang Yiping, Zhang Yunfu, Zhang Sumin, Zhou Xinmin, Liu Dajie, Wang Bolun, Fan Fengyuan, Wu Shutian, Xu Xingchu, Chen Zhenlu, Sheng Xugong, Yang Zhengyu, Wang Qufei, Chen Xianmo, Li Yongzhong, Lü Yifeng, Xu Suling, Lu Jiye, Chen Gaoyong, Tang Zenghao, Du Gangbai, Chen Zehua, Yan Shihua, Wang Fuyan, and Li Zhiyun, totaling more than fifty people. Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan and Wu Xingya, representing Jiang Jianbai, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, also attended.</p>
<p>Inaugural Meeting: The meeting began at 2 PM. Han Juemin, Lin Zhike, and Huang Xianzhang served as chairpersons, and Huang Bolun served as the recorder. After the formal proceedings, the chairperson delivered an opening speech, and Huang Xianzhang, a member of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparations. Next, Director Pan, representing the Party and government, delivered a speech. Finally, the constitution was adopted, and officers were elected. The meeting adjourned at around 5 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman of the presidium Han Juemin reported that China is currently facing both internal and external troubles. The country's weakness and the nation's decline have reached an extreme. To revitalize the country and restore the nation, we must follow the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, internally eliminate the communist bandits to achieve unification, and on the other hand, promote the national rejuvenation movement, revitalize the national spirit, and promote the national culture in order to save the declining nation and survive in the world. Therefore, how to revive the nation is the most urgent task. However, who will bear this responsibility of revival other than the intellectuals? Realizing this, colleagues have organized the Shanghai Professors and Writers Association to unite and carry out the practical work of national rejuvenation. In the future, we hope that professors and writers in all provinces and regions will unite, concentrate their efforts, and work together.</p>
<p>Pan's Speech: Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan said in his speech that Shanghai is a cultural center, but based on past circumstances, culture and the nation have been largely unrelated. For example, (1) works with feudalistic ideas still remain in society; (2) proletarian works advocating class struggle while forgetting the nation are rampant; (3) cynical and decadent romantic works are extremely popular. Therefore, the culture needed by the entire nation is lightly sacrificed. Now, the Shanghai Professors and Writers Association, realizing this, is determined to do a disinfection job, which is truly prescribing the right medicine for the illness.</p>
<p>Election of Officers: Han Juemin, Huang Xianzhang, Lin Zhike, Zhu Zhangbao, Chen Gaoyong, Lu Yinquan, Jiang Zhensan, Du Gangbai, and Wang Bolun were elected as executive committee members. Meng Shouchun, Zhang Yunfu, and Tang Jinbai were elected as alternate executive committee members.</p>

There are more than 200 graduates in this class, including more than 20 in the physics department. Because Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places are areas of cultural relics, they are eager to go north for sightseeing. Therefore, they organized a national industrial inspection group, led by Professor Chen Zhiqiang of the department, and came to Shanghai on the Taiyuan Wheel. They arrived at the shore today and invited Section Chief Li Dachao of the municipal government to guide them. Today, they will visit universities, large factories, and research institutes in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The letter said: Dear Editor, on March 25, your newspaper published a news item about a joint meeting of primary school principals, in which it was mentioned that Li Xizhi, a teacher at Shangde Primary School, had seduced and raped Gu Cuizhen, a student at Huadong Girls' High School. This association should write to the court to severely punish him in order to eliminate the scum of education. After investigation, there is no such person as Gu Cuizhen among our students. We are deeply afraid that the rumors are untrue, so we hereby request a correction. We hope you will investigate and handle it accordingly. Sincerely, the Education News Editor of Shen Bao, Private Huadong Girls' High School, March 25.</p>

<h3 id="e247">On Surnames by Yu Dafu <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The origin of surnames is, of course, as old as humanity itself. The Baihutong says: "In ancient times, the sages used pitch pipes to determine surnames...Why are there hundreds of surnames?...There are five correct sounds: Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zhi, and Yu, which are mixed and transformed. Five times five is twenty-five, which in turn produces the four seasons. Different airs and special sounds are all prepared, so there are hundreds of surnames...Why are there clan names? To value meritorious deeds and despise skills, or to clan-name after their official position, or clan-name after their job." The Tongzhi says: "Before the Three Dynasties, surnames and clan names were divided into two. Men were called by their clan names, and women were called by their surnames. Clan names were used to distinguish between noble and lowly, so the noble had clan names, and the lowly had names but no clan names. Surnames were used to distinguish between marriages, so there were distinctions between those of the same surname, different surnames, and collateral surnames. After the Three Dynasties, surnames and clan names were combined into one. In writing, the birth of a woman is a surname, so the bestowal of surnames mostly follows the female, such as Ji, Jiang, Ying, Si, Yao, Gui, Ji, Yun, Zhou, Yu, and Lao, etc." From these perspectives, surnames were originally the oldest, and they existed when the female-centered family system began; then there were clan names, which originated when there was a distinction between noble and lowly in society; later on, surnames and clan names were combined into one.</p>
<p>Ancient people had few teeth, so there were only hundreds of surnames. Later, the population increased, and transportation became widespread. After the Tang and Song dynasties, there were more than a thousand branches of surnames. The Hundred Family Surnames that we read in private schools when we were young, starting with the Zhao surname, everyone said that it was something from the early Song Dynasty, because at that time the Southern Tang had not yet been destroyed, and the King of Wuyue occupied the south, and his power was strong. His concubine was from the Sun clan, so the first four families of the Hundred Family Surnames were Zhao, Qian, Sun, and Li. In fact, the popular version of the Hundred Family Surnames has been simplified, and the intention is only to make it easier to read. If we talk about the surnames at that time, there would definitely not be only a hundred families.</p>
<p>The origin of ancient surnames and clan names was like this, so the importance of surnames and clan names in feudal society and the family system is naturally unnecessary to say. Now that we are about to break the feudal society and abolish the family system, the preservation or abolition of these surnames is of course a very worthy research question. During the May Fourth era, some people proposed abolishing surnames. Some scientists among my friends have said that after surnames are abolished, identification numbers can be used to replace names, just like patients in hospitals and police officers in Shanghai patrol stations. It is not inconvenient to use only number so-and-so to replace names. Professor Xuan Tong of Beiping also implemented this proposal. Among writers, there is even a Mr. named "Abolish Name."</p>
<p>Recently, because I saw the creative publication problems of Mr. He and Mr. Xu, which were very noisy, the people who defended them said that even names should be abolished, so why bother about this little thing. So I wrote this paragraph of miscellaneous thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Home of the Savages by Liu Ming <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>One autumn morning, I went with two children who grew up in the mountains to climb to the top of the mountain to visit the home of the savages.</p>
<p>The savages are all happy to live in those cool places on the top of the mountains. The valleys or small plains at the foot of the mountains, because they have a large amount of damp heat and miasma, are left for other ethnic groups to live in. The people of Yunnan call them mountain tops, which is not without meaning.</p>
<p>The houses are very small, and the two wings of the thatched eaves hang on the ground. The form of the tents inhabited by nomadic peoples is still left here. The skeletons of water buffalo heads are hung at the entrance, sometimes one, sometimes three or four, which are said to be used to ward off evil spirits.</p>
<p>Walking into this kind of door with water buffalo skulls hanging, I sat on the floor like a guest in a familiar savage's home. The so-called floor is only paved with reeds one by one. From below, there are often sounds of chickens flapping their wings and piglets howling; a kind of offensive smell of livestock also often permeates up through the gaps in the bamboo. The host is very old, but still healthy, because he often goes down the mountain to sell firewood and gradually became acquainted with us. He tremblingly placed a finely carved silver box in front of me and asked me to chew some betel nut and lime inside. I don't know how to chew betel nut, but I just took the silver box to look at, because in such a crude thatched house, there is such a delicate thing, which cannot but make people feel surprised. The old man probably also treasures this thing very much. As soon as the conversation started, he told me about its origin with great interest. I only understand a little of the savage language. Through his gestures and the translation of the two children, I learned that this silver box was given to him by a white man. Because when he was young, he followed the head of the mountain fortress all day long, doing service. At that time, white people came to the mountain to play and gave the headman many things, so he also got a share, which is the silver box that is now regarded as a treasure. Later, when I looked at the border treaty between Yunnan and Myanmar, I saw that this savage mountain fortress called "Hu Dong" still belonged to China in the late Qing Dynasty. Judging from the old man's age, it can be known that before this place was included in Myanmar, white people had very close contact with them.</p>
<p>The light in the house is very dim. After sitting for a while, I saw that there were still photos hanging in a corner. One is the majestic posture of a young soldier, with a rifle on his back and a long knife hanging on his waist. According to the old man, this is his eldest son, who is stationed in a very far place. After carefully checking the English written on it, I realized that it was sent back from the Kingdom of Mesopotamia. Another one is also a photo of a young man, but his eyebrows lack the heroic spirit, and he has no weapons either. The old man said that this is his second son who follows the foreign officials, probably a comprador or something like that.</p>
<p>In the mountain fortress, there are wooden two-story foreign houses, schools, churches, and post offices are all set up inside. On the veranda, between the doors, and in the windows, the white hats of the nuns and the long beards of the chubby priests often flash by. The voices of children reciting or singing loudly flow out from between the fences. I don't know why. Once I left the old man's house and saw this school, I felt that future Sol-diers and Servants were being mass-produced.</p>
<p>When going down the mountain, the old man sent us several huge bull belly fruits. We ate half of them on the road, and the rest were thrown into the deep valley because they became heavier and heavier.</p>

<p>I stole a glance at his face, which was using stubbornness to withstand eternal pain, and felt a little pleasure. So I quickly whipped the cow's back, pulled the rope and walked away, wandering in the southern corner of the lawn, deliberately loudly scolding the black animal I was riding. The smell of cow dung and grass wafted through people's nostrils with the evening breeze. He seemed unable to grasp my meaning behind him and sang a clumsy, teasing tune in a patient voice. The cow was full and habitually walked towards home. When I was about to leave the lawn, I turned my head and said to him, "When you see the moon peeking out from the east, come to the Wind and Rain Pavilion, okay?" The cheerful singing definitely rose up behind my head.</p>
<p>After dinner, my sister suppressed her smile and said to me, "Just now Deputy Huang brought news from your brother-in-law, asking us two to go to the provincial capital with him tomorrow morning. Good, let's hurry up and prepare our things."</p>
<p>"Hey, didn't you say a few days? ... Then, can't we go the day after tomorrow?" I clumsily made my useless request. She shook her head at me as if she understood something, and smiled slyly.</p>
<p>The silvery moonlight shone into the living room, pouring over the people who were busy packing things. From the mountain, there was a constant transmission of depressed and sturdy mountain songs of young men and women who were flirting. This kind of sound, like the shouting of a monster that had been pressed under the sea for a long time, pierced my ears unusually. I was about to be destroyed in anxiety and cursing! When I was free and quietly ran out, everyone had closed their doors. Probably because the mountain songs were completely silent, the moon seemed particularly desolate. I walked into the Wind and Rain Pavilion, breathed a sigh of relief comfortably, and my eyes arbitrarily searched this lonely mountain top. The lights that would not go out until the sun rose from the Lai Family Village, annoyingly flashed under the moon, like phantoms, vaguely showing that there were many sturdy figures busy working in the threshing ground, and the sound of beating rice stalks densely and suddenly stabbed my nerves, and proudly shook the entire village.</p>
<p>I wandered around the Wind and Rain Pavilion, and the cold dew coldly touched my skin through the thin clothes, like giving me an ominous omen. I clenched my fists, raised my head and carefully looked at the tall Lion Hill that was about to fall asleep, and slowly strolled back to the house.</p>
<p>For the sake of busy farming, and for the sake of threshing grain all night long with Lai Laohu, the farmhands of Lai Family Village and I will never be able to meet again.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Sketches of Beiping by Yao Ke <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>(2) Wind and Dust</p>
<p>Like an avalanche, sprinkled like powder in the air, the sky has turned gray-yellow丨This is the curse of Beiping丨Wind and dust. In fact, although the wind in Beiping is strong, it is far less than the hurricane in Shanghai last year. However, when Beiping people talk about the word "wind," it is as painful as when Shanghai people talk about "rent increase." This is probably because of the "dust." The wind and dust have reached a tacit understanding, and the momentum is indeed huge, which is not comparable to ordinary ones.</p>
<p>When the wind blows, people can hear the whistling of the wind in the house, which shakes the doors and windows. Although my houses in Beiping are tightly papered, they cannot avoid the invasion of wind and dust. In a short while, a layer of yellow-black fine dust settles on the tables and miscellaneous objects, even in the drawers, which can be said to be "penetrating everywhere!"</p>
<p>It goes without saying that once you go out the door. The wind helps the dust, and the dust borrows the power of the wind. The yellow dust occupies the entire space. Women use thin veils to cover their faces, and men wear windproof glasses or cover their mouths and noses with handkerchiefs, but it is still useless. Only by sitting in a rickshaw, with cotton canopies covering it tightly on all sides, can you avoid the impact of wind and dust. However, the rickshaw pullers still pull the rickshaw as usual丨although slower than usual丨According to some people, they are born with the embryo of pulling rickshaws, so they have this camel-like instinct!</p>
<p>However, sitting in a rickshaw with a cotton canopy only avoids the wind and dust hitting your face; the gloomy and bone-chilling cold air still seeps in through the gaps in the cotton canopy. Licking your tongue on your lips, you feel a circle of dust sticking to it. Looking forward through a small piece of glass in the car curtain, the rickshaw puller seems to be running in the wind and dust like flying through the clouds. When you pull it to your destination, jump out of the car and look at his face, you will definitely suspect that he is not the rickshaw puller just now! His face is as black as a coal store clerk, only showing a pair of black eyes and two rows of white teeth!</p>
<p>When the wind is blowing, the best thing to do is naturally to "sit at home behind closed doors." If you must go out, sitting in a rickshaw cannot completely block the wind and avoid the dust. The best thing is to take a car, close the car doors tightly, and wrap a fox fur car blanket around your legs, no matter how strong the wind and dust are, it will not be able to do anything!</p>
<p>Not only that, but even when there is no wind, taking a car and speeding on the street like flying, rolling up a gust of wind and raising half a street of dust, is also full of power. This kind of power is not available in Shanghai cars.</p>

<p>Gui Zhuang (Xuangong)'s "Diary of Seeking Flowers" is a wonderful work in ancient diary literature. The "Xiaoshishanfang Series" has published its complete manuscript (the initial publication does not include everything). The life of the Ming loyalists can be seen in the process of his seeking flowers. A month ago, I obtained a letter he wrote to Weng Jilin in Guiwei year, saying: "I went out in May and stayed in Jiangbei, and returned in September. The people of Kunshan were all surprised when they saw me, because it had been rumored that I had died for a long time. According to the Five Elements Chronicle, all false rumors are attributed to disasters. For example, false rumors about the Yellow Dragon Child and false rumors about the arrival of a great flood are all recorded in history. This year, there were earthquakes and floods, which are manifestations of disasters in heaven and earth. The people of Jiangnan falsely rumored that I was dead or alive, which is a manifestation of disasters in human affairs. I don't know whether today's historians should also write it down? I laugh. I once said that the oranges and tangerines of Dongting, the maple tea of Yu Mountain, and the chrysanthemums of the seashore all belong to the sacred view, and they are all in one time and place. It is difficult to get them all without the same route. When autumn and winter meet, I should moor a small boat on the river bank and let the wind blow it, east to the east and west to the west. The west wind has been tight for several days, and it will blow to the chrysanthemum bushes on the coast of the East China Sea. The red buds and red fruits in the mountains, I know they are already rotten, it's a pity that I have no chance this year, I can only dream of traveling." Not only do you see the life situation of Gui Zhuang's group of people, but the helpless and unavoidable sad and indignant mood is also a good reference for "Diary of Seeking Flowers," so I quickly recorded it.</p>

<p>"Not yet. They're very busy, you know, they don't just have this one thing. I went a few times and said it wasn't clear. Who thought they only had this one thing to do? Didn't you say He Zhonghua's matter would be settled in just one day? But although she thought so, she didn't say it.</p>
<p>"I'll go ask again later," Zhuo Yun said, preparing to end this conversation.</p>
<p>"Sorry for the trouble. When can I get the money? Can I come get it next Monday?"</p>
<p>"You can get it when it's settled."</p>
<p>"I mean, I want to get the publication fee first on Monday."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you still can't get it. Fortunately, the day is still early, today is only the 20th: it probably won't be too long," Zhuo Yun comforted.</p>
<p>The Monday that Yina said she wanted to get the publication fee was the day her younger brother and sister started school. If you want to go to school, you should pay the tuition first, so she really wanted to get the money that day. But she clearly saw that it was hopeless, because if she continued to say that, it might make Xi Zhuoyun feel that she was too ignorant, and say things like the right to pay the money was not in him, and he had to discuss it. So she no longer asked, and after getting his permission to "notify you as soon as it's settled," she left his office.</p>
<p>"This time, Xiao Ji and Xiao An will also be affected!" She thought sluggishly as she walked down the road in a daze. "I'll just make the excuse that it's the New Year and ask them to start school a few days later. Sigh, the New Year! That's right, why does the school start before the New Year? Isn't it also to collect that tuition to deal with everything at the end of the year? This end of the year is so difficult, won't anyone just stay here and not be able to get through it? If Xi Zhuoyun 丨"</p>
<p>Thinking of that, her heart jumped, because she knew that if the money that Xi Zhuoyun promised her became a problem, she would be one of those people who couldn't get through it.</p>
<p>In that unstable state, Yina only looked forward to the afternoon in the morning, and looked forward to tomorrow today, hoping that she could get the money sooner. She lived so unsteadily until the evening of the 23rd, when she received the letter from Xi Zhuoyun that she was so eagerly waiting for. In that letter, he said that the publishing house had agreed to sell the manuscript, but was only willing to add two yuan per thousand words in addition to the publication fee (in her letter, she followed his suggestion and asked to add four yuan per thousand words). Finally, he advised her to agree to it anyway.</p>
<p>"What's there to disagree with?" The heart that had been hanging in the air for a few days, but now had a landing, was laughing.</p>

<h3 id="e255">American Bank Fails to Revive, Gold Price Drops Another Four Yuan <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday the gold market continued to decline, while silver futures rose. Coupled with the American Bank's failure to revive, market sentiment was weak. At the start of the morning, overseas silver markets saw British silver remain level while American silver rose. The forward silver price at the Five Metals Exchange rose by varying amounts, from 0.28 to 0.55 percent. Exchange rates fell, American cotton rose by 14 points, and American wheat rose by half a dollar. At the opening of the wool market, prices immediately retreated to within 60 yuan. Although prices briefly broke through the 60 yuan mark, market sentiment was unstable and prices fell again. Reports indicate that 24 senators from the White faction of the American Senate have formed a committee to promote silver legislation and implement the principle of using silver as currency at a fixed ratio to gold. In addition, Senators Wheeler and King are convening a meeting of 17 senators from the western states to plan a new offensive for the White silver bill in this congressional session, claiming that they will continue to demand the expansion of the White silver bill's effects or propose bimetallism with a legally fixed gold-silver ratio. The market opened flat, briefly rising above 60 yuan. However, with HSBC posting long positions and Sassoon offering to sell, the situation remained weak, but the fluctuations were narrower. Speculator Wu also sold. Later, banks' appetite trended towards bargain hunting, and the market stabilized slightly, remaining generally flat. Apart from the end of the American strike, there was little international news throughout the day. The price of March gold also fell, with the price of pure gold calculated at 974 yuan, with a drop of one yuan and one and a half yuan for deferred contracts. The day's market conditions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 958.6 yuan, a decrease of 4.1 yuan from last Saturday. Goods opened at 8.8 yuan. The morning opening exchange rates were 1 shilling, 4 and 3125/10000 pence for British currency and 34.6875 yuan for American currency for near-term sales. Mitsui offered to sell June American dollars at 35 yuan, and Banque Belge offered July at 125/10000. Hengxing sold bullion, and retail investors also pressed prices down, from 9.4 yuan to 8.2 yuan. Qian Changxiang, Yifeng, Yongyi, Chengzhifeng, Yongyuanheng, and others bought, raising prices to 9.2 yuan. It was anticipated that HSBC would post British currency up 125/10000 and American currency up 25/10000. Hengxing sold again, bringing prices to 7.8 yuan. Banque Belge bought May American dollars at 9375/10000, June at 35.0625 yuan, and July at 1875/10000. Sheng Dayuan, Cangyong, and others sold, while Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yongdalong, Xianyi, and Dayong bought up to 60.04 yuan. Zhifeng, Yongyi, and Dayong sold off, causing a drop of 1 yuan, but Hengyu, Dadecheng, and others continued to buy, raising prices again to 61 yuan. Later, Sassoon suddenly offered to sell a significant amount of shillings and American dollars, and Hengxing, Yuanmao, and Yong sold, bringing prices down to 58.3 yuan. Hengyu and Shengda took advantage of the low prices to buy. Chartered Bank bought August American dollars at 25/10000, briefly raising prices to 9.4 yuan. Banque Belge offered July American dollars at 0625/10000, but prices continued to decline, with retail investors pressing prices down to 8.1 yuan. Wing Fung and Hengda bought bullion from Xingyong, raising prices again to 9.5 yuan. Later, the situation became stagnant, with much fluctuation. Zhifeng, Yongyingfengheng, and Hengxing sold off, but with Qian Changxiang, Wanxing, Yuankangxiang, and others still buying, prices struggled around 9 yuan. The afternoon closing price was 958.9 yuan, with goods priced at 8.8 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening price was 958.5 yuan, with goods at the same price. Shengda, Hengyu, Daxing, Yongyuanmao, and others bought together, raising prices to 9.7 yuan. Fuyu and the Dalian gang sold at high prices, bringing prices down again to 8.7 yuan. Zhengjin and Chartered Bank both bid for August American dollars at 25/10000, stabilizing prices. Yidayong bought bullion. Mitsui bought July American dollars at 125/10000 and August at 25/10000, raising prices again to 9.5 yuan. Wing Fung, Hengyi, Dayong, Hengxingyuan sold bullion, retreating to 9 yuan. At this point, Shengda and others were still buying and making multiple bids. Later, Daxing and Yongshengda sold off, and Yidayong, Zhengchang, Richang, Xiexingyong, and others also supplied, causing a further drop to 8.4 yuan. The closing price was 958.6 yuan, with goods priced at 8.7 yuan. After the market closed, Bingxing and others bought slightly, leading to a more stable situation. The highest price of the day was 961 yuan, and the lowest was 957.8 yuan, a difference of 3.2 yuan. As a result, the closing price was down 4.1 yuan from last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price, due to HSBC posting American currency up 25/10000, was 34.25 yuan, equivalent to a gold price of 1010.22 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 51 yuan less, about 3 yuan less than last Saturday. The settlement price for this month, due to HSBC posting shillings up 125/10000, was 1 shilling, 4 and 125/10000 pence, which, based on the British-American exchange rate, equates to a gold price of 716 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 1 yuan less, slightly less than last Saturday. The registered price for this month was 714 yuan, for April it was 960 yuan, and for May it was 959 yuan. Morning replenishment was 714 yuan, afternoon was 715 yuan. The price of pure gold was calculated at 974 yuan. The market sentiment was slightly weak. More than 3,000 taels of East goods arrived yesterday. Formal transactions involved Wing Fung Heng selling over 900 taels of 99.3% purity to the Tianjin gang at an additional 15 yuan. In addition, fellow merchants bought East goods at an additional 12.5 yuan. However, the Central Bank's appetite for cash was sluggish, with no transactions reported. For deferred contracts, Yidayong offered 21 contracts, and Dafeng Heng offered 35 contracts, while Yuanmaoyong bid up 1.5 yuan, and Wing Fung Heng offered Dadecheng 14 contracts for 1 yuan. As of today, 2,260 April contracts remained, with a total of 13 long positions and 9 short positions.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was extremely flat. In summary, Hengxing, Zhifengyong, Dafayongyi, Dayongruixing, Huixiang, Wing Fungheng, Qianjingxiang, Futaiheng, etc., were sellers, while Shunliwanxing, Hengyuhengchang, Yongsidabingxing, Fuyu, Shengda, etc., were buyers. Hengxingyuan, Dachangxiang, Fuxingyong, Xiexingyong, Yuqingyong, advanced before retreating, while Hengtai, Daxingyong, Yifengyong, Tongchunyuanchun, retreated before advancing. The Dalian gang and Shunli jointly traded over 1,900 contracts, with a net purchase of over 400 contracts. Wanxing jointly traded over 1,700 contracts, with a net purchase of over 300 contracts. The Guang gang and Shengda jointly bought approximately 600 contracts, and sold over 400 contracts. Hengxing bought a small number of contracts and sold slightly less than 800. As of today, the total number of May chips was 19,130, with a total of 42 long positions and 54 short positions. The total number of transactions for the day was 39,361 in the morning and 12,649 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The interbank call rate has remained at 2% for white loans and has consistently remained at 4% without fluctuations. Yesterday was no different. Overdrafts plus water still did not exceed 2-3%. In terms of usage, conditions were better than last week. In terms of trading, over 4.6 million was traded in the early session, 300,000 each was traded in new transactions and the noon session, 400,000 was traded in the Small General Association. The remaining bank clearings were slightly busy due to the Xingqi 1 situation. Foreign banks cleared 2.78 million in checks and 4.34 million in miscellaneous cash deposits for goods and foreign exchange, plus 1.23 million for foreign exchange settlements. Recently, there have been a large number of foreign exchange clearings because Chinese businesses and import and export firms are buying up a lot of foreign exchange, which has resulted in a lot of clearing. The outgoing amount was 400,000. Chinese banks cleared 3.12 million in checks, 4.78 million in miscellaneous cash deposits for goods and foreign exchange, plus 200,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Japanese banks cleared 2.4 million in checks, 3.78 million in miscellaneous cash deposits for goods and foreign exchange, plus 300,000 in warehouse withdrawals.

<h3 id="e260">Securities - Last Day of March Futures - Bond Market Extremely Chaotic <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Speculators have already emerged... various bonds fell back by 0.2 to 1 yuan</p>
<p>1926 Bonds are Uniquely Strong... Highest Peak Reached 12.8 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the market was extremely chaotic on the last day of trading for March futures. The 1926 Bonds were particularly volatile. The reporter repeatedly warned that those who blindly follow will suffer losses. It was known early on that the rumors were fabricated, and that those involved would not hesitate to harm others for their own benefit. These bonds neither repay principal nor pay interest, yet rumors of consolidation suddenly caused the 1926 Bonds to surge while other bonds fell significantly. The common ignorant investor has been harmed more than once. In reality, the 1926 Bonds were issued for 96 million yuan, of which over 56 million was in Japanese currency. They have never been drawn for interest payments. Even the Japanese portion has only repaid principal three times. Before the Japanese portion can be consolidated, the domestic silver portion is of course even more out of the question. Understanding this, the repeated harm suffered by the ignorant is their own fault. Yesterday, the early session saw most bonds fall back by a small amount, from 2-3 jiao to 6-7 jiao. The 1926 Bonds remained unaffected. The Disbandment and Demobilization Bonds rose slightly due to short covering. The secondary session saw a consistent decline of around 0.5 yuan. Later, the Unified Salt Bonds remained relatively stable, while the 1926 Bonds were artificially inflated, surging by around 0.5 yuan. At the afternoon opening, various bonds rebounded by 2-4 jiao, while the 1926 Bonds suddenly surged by 0.5 to 2 yuan. At the close, various bonds fell back by 2-3 jiao to 6-7 jiao, while the 1926 Bonds fell sharply by over 1.5 yuan. This situation was obviously caused by speculators manipulating prices to prepare for an exit. As a result, the market prices ranged from 2-3 jiao to 1 yuan, while the 1926 Bonds remained up by 0.2 to 0.75 yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 30 million. The closing price was 8 p.m., so details are omitted. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>The yarn market remains weak, and the situation remains soft. With the surrounding environment deteriorating, factories are considering not entering the exchange, but actual market demand is sluggish. Apart from offering standard yarns for sale, there is no other solution. As a result, yarn inventories in warehouses are accumulating, with a huge 14,800 bales of new goods having already been delivered. A certain factory had a firm intention to purchase, but now, seeing the poor situation and the inability of factories to unite, it is difficult to support the overall situation alone, and they will reluctantly settle this month's quota, so the market prices are falling daily. However, the future of the cotton industry appears bleak.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Marked Yarn Lacks Major Buyers <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Although American cotton rose at the opening of the morning yarn market, the market atmosphere was poor and lacked major buyers. Prices for all months fell by 0.5, 0.6, 0.9 to 1 yuan. In the afternoon, prices for all months fell by another 0.2, 0.3 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 40,000 bales. The sellers were Changyu (3,000 bales), Yuande (2,050 bales), Xincheng (3,000 bales), Dachang (900 bales), and Dafeng (850 bales). The buyers were Changfeng (1,200 bales), Hengda (950 bales), Chunji (1,500 bales), Suilong (750 bales), Jinchang (1,000 bales), Gengfeng (1,700 bales), and Tonghe (1,250 bales).

<p>The cotton market is relatively stable, due to the rising price of American cotton. As today is the last day of the month, the market atmosphere at the opening in the morning was relatively level. In the afternoon, rumors in the market said that there was a shortage of delivery chips, and the market price rose again, with the third round rising by 0.3-0.4 yuan to 42.4 yuan. Unexpectedly, at the close, some long positions did not intend to take delivery and released their positions, causing a sudden sharp drop of 0.65 yuan, resulting in a final price of 41.75 yuan, down 1.2 yuan from last month's final price. The current cotton consumption is sluggish, due to the poor sales of yarn and the shutdown of factory stomachs.</p>

<h3 id="e268">Grains - Speculators Sell Off Marked Flour <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a generally weak trend after opening in the morning for all months. Foreign wheat quotations were up approximately 0.12 yuan in Chicago and up 0.08 yuan in Canada. When prices opened, the market atmosphere was still relatively stable. However, with actual sales showing no activity, some speculators, in this environment, dared not hold on any longer and gradually sold off their positions, causing the market to become sluggish. When the afternoon market opened, the near-term and long-term situations remained unfavorable. Although factories did not release new chips, the overall domestic purchasing power was extremely weak. It was also rumored that Tianjin flour mills, with an influx of wheat from the surrounding countryside, were able to operate at full capacity, while Shanghai mills were mostly operating at reduced capacity. From this situation, it appears that the demand for Shanghai flour is facing another obstacle. As a result, the current month was down 0.0125 yuan from the previous week, April was up 0.015 yuan, May was down 0.02 yuan, June was down 0.0175 yuan, July was down 0.015 yuan, and August was down 0.02 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Wheat Market Quiet, Empty Auctions Predominate <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market remained quiet and lifeless. As the current month is approaching delivery, only the morning session saw trading, down 0.01 yuan. The afternoon saw mostly empty auctions, while other months remained at the same price, with empty auctions predominating. Although the future outlook is not good, due to the timing, both long and short positions dare not enter or exit the market. However, the current influx of spot wheat is a cause for concern for future standard prices, and changes must be observed. The spot wheat market remains stable. However, shipments from Shandong, Henan, and Gansu have all arrived, which was unexpected by the factories. The market value can be temporarily maintained due to factory demand. Dali collected wheat opened at 3.6 yuan, Huangqiao wheat at 3.6 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 3.54 yuan, Wuhe wheat at 3.54 yuan, Yingzhou wheat at 3.54 yuan, Xuzhou Yaowan wheat at 3.6 yuan, and Shandong wheat at 3.65 yuan for 3,000, totaling 14,000 bales, which were reportedly handled by Fuxin Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Evening Rice Market Conditions – Market Goods Are Weak <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>丨Thick Japonica and All Kinds of Colors are Stable丨</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over forty cargo ships arrived from various gangs (estimated at over 6,000 stones of goods). Due to the drizzling rain, the market sentiment stabilized slightly. Therefore, the prices for regular gangs such as Sutong and Nan'gang Japonica remained unchanged from the previous levels. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan were also average. However, regarding the late rice from various gangs, the purchasing intentions of the Nan'yang gang, who had previously contracted orders, weakened and their selection criteria became more middle-to-lower grade, while the Bei'yang gang showed the opposite trend, with stronger purchasing power and selective picking of higher-grade materials. This created a market trend of increasing prices for higher grades and decreasing prices for lower grades. As a result, a total of 2,300 to 2,400 packages of Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xilian late rice were shipped by both the Nan'yang and Bei'yang gangs. The prices for high-quality goods increased by four to five cents, while middle-to-lower quality goods decreased by two to three cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, various goods from He'xia reached the 22nd and 23rd terms. Sales of various types of rice in the market were very slow. The price of white Japonica continued to decrease slightly by three to five cents. Yangdu, Bukejian, early thin rice, Baiyuan, and Yinyuan prices remained weak.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Customer Rice Price Decline – Sales Activation <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Local Merchants are Attempting to Operate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xian rice market was initially weak due to ample inventory and continuous supply. Some goods owners urgently sought to sell, willingly lowering prices for early sales. Therefore, the asking price for various rice continued to decrease slightly by three to four cents. Local merchants began to inquire, and Wen and Yong gangs continued to attempt to handle various types of rough Xian rice. This street and Fuzhou also showed some interest. Although transactions were not booming, they had become more active. If the current handling can successfully digest the customer rice, then there should be continued sales in the future. However, the market inventory is sufficient, the supply is continuous, and the goods en route have not yet fully arrived. Therefore, hoping for a significant increase in market prices is very difficult. Yesterday, the entire city shipped 900 packages of Chenji Xian rice through this street, priced at 6 yuan 10 cents to 6 yuan 3 cents. Ningbo shipped 160 packages of Jingliu rough rice, priced at 6 yuan 5 cents.

<h3 id="e272">Soybean Purchasing Interest Remains Good <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no significant change in the soybean market conditions, and the outlook was still less optimistic. As the Dalian soybean market declined, shipping to Shanghai was still able to meet sales. Therefore, the market sentiment was weak. Yesterday, a carload of large Yingzhou beans, a carload of medium-sized beans, a carload of Xuzhou beans, a carload of Feihe beans, two carloads of Bengbu beans, two carloads of Bozhou beans, a carload of Nanshaoji beans, and over 700 packages of Guide Dangshan beans were sold. The outlets include exports to Fuzhou, inland car workshops, and local factory sales.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Silk and Tea – Hangzhou and Shaoxing Spring Silkworms Begin Incubation <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Unfavorable Weather Conditions Hinder Hatching – Sericulture in Zhejiang Province is earliest in the Hangzhou and Shaoxing regions. The Qingming Festival is approaching soon. Farmers in early sericulture areas such as Yuhang, Haining, and Chang'an in Hangzhou, and Qianshan and Xinchang in Shaoxing, are now starting to incubate silkworm eggs. The current batch of egg papers are all improved varieties sold by the Improvement Association, priced at 85 cents per sheet. However, the weather has been unstable recently, with varying temperatures, which is unfavorable for incubation. Based on the weather on the day of the Flowers Birthday yesterday (February 12th of the lunar calendar), which was cloudy with light rain, sericulture farmers predict that the silkworm harvest this spring may not be abundant.</p>
<p>Wuxi Stocked Silk Transported to Shanghai for Storage – Recently, silk sales overseas have been sluggish, reaching an extreme point. Wuxi manufacturers hold significant amounts of silk in stock and are suffering huge losses, making it impossible to promote sales. As spring sericulture in Zhejiang Province begins, new silkworms will soon enter the market. Manufacturers are transporting their stocked silk to Shanghai and storing it in foreign warehouses in preparation for temporarily mortgaging it to the Shanghai financial community to raise funds for purchasing cocoons. Therefore, over two hundred packages of white filature silk have been transported to Shanghai via freight cars from Wuxi in recent days.</p>
<p>European and American Silk Sales Have Become Stagnant – The European and American raw silk markets have recently become sluggish due to the slow sales of silk fabrics. Most silk weaving factories have reduced production or stopped operations. Currently, silk factories face sluggish sales, and silk prices have plummeted. Foreign firms in Shanghai do not dare to risk purchasing raw silk, while Chinese silk merchants cannot promote sales due to significant losses. Domestic silk factories also have no interest in purchasing. The silk market has become stagnant. Yesterday, only Dafeng and others purchased five packages of white filature and ten packages of grey filature at declining prices.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Flourishing Tea Industry in Hunan and Hubei <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>Since 1925, the black tea industry in Hunan and Hubei provinces has been ravaged internally by communist bandits and externally by the encroachment of Indian tea sales. The annual export volume has decreased from 300,000 chests to 60,000-70,000 chests. Tea farmers and merchants in the region have reached the extreme of hardship. Currently, some merchants, seeing that the sales of coarse tea in England were not bad last year, have a very strong interest in Hunan and Hubei black tea. Recently, in tea-producing areas such as Anhua, Taoyuan, Changshou Street, and Niejiashi, more than thirty new tea processing plants have been established. Including the existing tea companies, there are now more than 120 in total. Tea companies in Hankou have also sent staff to the mountains to provide loans. The situation is very prosperous.</p>

<p>— Autumn</p>
<p>I often hear people say, "The Chinese national character is 'official.'" Why is that? Because from the moment a person is born, they are related to "official." When a family has a new son or grandson, they all call him "Aguan" or "Guanguan." Even his parents and elders have to give him a nickname. The eldest is called "Daguan" (Big Official), the second is called "Erguan" (Second Official). If their Five Elements lack metal, they call him "Jinguan" (Gold Official). If his zodiac sign is a tiger, he's called "Huguan" (Tiger Official). Other names like Fuguan (Fortune Official), Shouguan (Longevity Official), Chunguan (Spring Official), Qiuguan (Autumn Official), Qianguan (Heaven Official), Kunguan (Earth Official)... the list is endless. In short, everyone loves "official." "Official" is truly welcomed!</p>
<p>As for families, their sole hope is that their children and grandchildren will become officials, so they can glorify the family and honor the ancestors. In society, the ultimate envy is nothing more than wanting to become an official, so they can buy land, gain power, and show off their influence. So, relatives and friends pray for nothing more than promotion and wealth; the local community worships nothing more than seeing officials taking office.</p>
<p>In the past, during the warlord era, people who couldn't get an official position would dream about it. Those who were obsessed with office would become "official addicts." The higher-ups sold official titles, while those below relied on the influence of officials. But it's not easy to become an official. As the saying goes, "Don't become an official unless you have someone in court." With a patron, even the most incompetent person can become an official, and they can do whatever they want without any scruples. As the saying goes, "Only the magistrate is allowed to set fires; the common people are not allowed to light lamps." They can be full of official airs and speak in official jargon, ignoring the affairs of the people, saying, "Even an honest official can't settle family disputes." Colleagues must help each other, adhering to the principle of "officials protect each other." If you don't have a strong background, you must curry favor with your superiors, otherwise, you'll be "kicked out" when a "new official takes office." The official arena is just like a theater; who goes on stage without eventually stepping down? Occasionally, there are one or two who are relatively honest, and they are hailed as good officials, like living Buddhas for the people, with their praises sung far and wide.</p>
<p>Speaking of being an official, one should be upright and honest, and able to adhere to official principles to deserve the position. It's just that the officials we usually see are mostly corrupt, incompetent, plague-like, and muddleheaded, so good officials are all the more rare and precious.</p>
<p>Officials have an official air, and officials have an official addiction. To taste the official flavor, one must drill and scheme to get it. To indulge in the official addiction, one must boast and flatter to achieve it. So, lawyers don't want to be lawyers, they want to be judges; doctors don't want to be doctors, they want to be medical officers; policemen want to be police officers, soldiers want to be military officers. Other banks have directors, post offices have postal officials, even guards have guards officers, and secretaries have secretarial officers. Whether they are scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, soldiers, or police, everyone wants to be an official. Even the smallest official, the so-called "sesame seed and mung bean official," must be an official for the sake of being an official, to feel satisfied. Once an official position is obtained, it doesn't matter about academic qualifications, talent, or knowledge. As long as one has good official luck, even if you "mumble three garbled official scriptures," you'll still spread official reputation and climb the official ladder. That's why everyone wants to be an official.</p>

<p>— Shiyun</p>
<p>Recently, the direction of literature and art has quickly shifted to national literature. Originally, the direction of literature and art should follow the wheel of the times, and any literature and art that doesn't fit the times will inevitably be eliminated.</p>
<p>In the past, many of the literary and artistic creations we saw were mostly decadent, licentious, romantic, and proletarian literature with the implication of inciting class struggle. This kind of poison flowed into society and once anesthetized a part of the people, but in today's China, the rural economy is on the verge of collapse, and the social economy is showing signs of disintegration. Unless the internal groups are united and work together in production, the entire nation will be in danger. Therefore, decadent licentious, romantic, and proletarian literature can only decline with the wheel of the times.</p>
<p>In the past, some people advocated national literature, hoping to stand out in this tide of decadence, licentiousness, romance, and proletarianism, but the ideal and the reality were the opposite. As a result, it only appeared briefly and disappeared, but I always believed that national literature would be revived one day. Sure enough, national literature has recently become the darling of the times. This is because everyone knows that China has been deceived by imperialists, and only a strong nation can compete with others in the world. The current era is to awaken the resonance of the entire nation and work together to revive the nation's domestic production, so naturally, national literature should emerge in response to the times.</p>
<p>May literature revive the decline of the past eight generations. I hope that young people standing in front of the times will work hard to become the Han Yu of the modern era!</p>
<h3 id="e295">Study of Inkstones (10) <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Wuliao Ke</p>
<p>Overview of Duan Inkstones</p>
<p>(D) Sky Blue: Previous people only discussed sky blue by saying that it should be clear and flawless, excelling in beauty with a blue color, like the clear blue sky after autumn rain. Generally, it is like the sky blue color of porcelain after rain. Or it is said to be like the first stars disappearing in the morning, and the rising sun not yet appearing, with a quiet and profound beauty; or it is said to be like looking at the sky from afar, clear both inside and out. These are just descriptions based on each person's perspective, and there is no fixed color. However, the Japanese strongly divide it into three types:</p>
<p>(1) Like sky blue after rain, with a blue sky color seen faintly from light purple, it is an unparalleled masterpiece;</p>
<p>(2) Slightly red-blue color, like the dawn sky mixed with red;</p>
<p>(3) Slightly purple-gray-blue, like the twilight sky when the sun has set and the stars have not yet appeared.</p>
<p>As for the names "dawn sky blue" and "dusk sky blue," we have not yet been able to confirm that they are definitive. However, it is certain that sky blue has rouge-colored fire patterns and flowing cloud spots, which may be scattered or formed into pieces. Today, people often think that an inkstone that is entirely blue-purple, like the sky-blue satin color from the past, is sky blue. In fact, this kind of purple color is the natural color of the Old Pit Duan stone, not sky blue. Sky blue must be like the white of banana leaves, with colors of clouds and rainbows around it, which is the genuine article. However, it is very difficult to determine which is dawn sky blue or dusk sky blue. Wu Shihua said that blue flowers are the glory of the stone, fish brain banana white is the marrow of the stone, and sky blue is the flesh of the stone. The difference between marrow and flesh is only in the spirit and charm, without much difference, so it is listed as a beautiful pattern with fish brain banana white.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Xiuzhi, a contemporary collector and connoisseur of inkstones, gave me a sky blue inkstone last year, with blue flower rouge halo, which is indeed a top grade. However, it is still impossible to determine whether it is dawn sky blue or dusk sky blue.</p>
<h3 id="e296">Biography of Auntie Back Building <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Many times, many times, I wanted to write a short biography for someone.</p>
<p>After all, my friends, my relatives, my... are not qualified. Writing a biography without finding the protagonist of the biography is also a troublesome thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had to lower my standards and found "Auntie Back Building."</p>
<p>Auntie Back Building has no surname, no name, and is so named because she is young and lives in the back building.</p>
<p>Speaking of her appearance, although not very prominent, it is not bad either. She has a plump face, a big nose, thick lips, and broad front teeth. As for her eyes, when opened, they are like copper bells, and when squinted, they are like a line. She looks at people out of the corner of her eye, creating a natural charm. The source of the essence of her face lies here.</p>
<p>However, Auntie Back Building is not satisfied with this. Snow cream, cologne, rouge (Note: Her rouge is a corner of red paper) is applied and applied again, until she is beautified to the point where "from afar, she looks like a celestial maiden, and up close, she resembles a living ??".</p>
<p>"Auntie Back Building" claims to be from the other side of the Yangtze River in Jiangnan, and her Shanghai dialect is mixed with some local accent, which is melodious and amusing. She loves to gamble and does not distinguish between day and night, neglecting sleep and meals. Her husband sometimes comes home and has to "cook his own meals," make tea, wash dishes, and mop the floor. But Auntie Back Building still cannot forgive her husband when she finds a dishwashing brush bristle in her vegetable bowl or a brick piece in her rice bowl.</p>
<p>One evening, perhaps because she had a sudden "whim," she suddenly ran into my front building, which could not help but make me flustered, which could not help but make me drop my pen and stand up. I stole a glance at her face, which had a man-eating smile. "Uh... Sister-in-law... Is there anything... wrong?"</p>
<p>"See Mr. Chen's room." She said, and then looked around.</p>
<p>Seeing that I would not greet her, she went out. "Hehe! Mr. Chen eats tender things."</p>
<p>My fright settled, I smoked a cigarette, and then wrote "Biography of Sister-in-Law Back Building" to pass it on to posterity.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Six: Generously Baring His Heart, Forgetting His Family to Serve the Country; Sadly Facing the Jade Mirror, Sighing for My Beloved</p>
<p>When the two men peered outward through the hole in the wall, it was Guan Yaowu and Yin Deren standing together in the open space, talking. So the two men also walked out and stood in the same place. Zhao Ziqiang laughed: We men are all unsettled, only Second Brother Yin is good, he’s a bachelor. Yin Deren stuck his hands in his pockets, hopped twice, and laughed: Being a bachelor is good but when you get old, or if you get sick, that would be a little bit troublesome. Guan Yaowu said: Do you like having a family? Let’s trade places, whoever doesn’t want to switch is not human. Yin Deren spat and laughed: It’s hard for you to be an older brother, how can you say such things? If your sister-in-law was here, she might just slap you twice. Guan Yaowu had nothing to say, and shrugged his shoulders twice. Tian Qing laughed: I think Brother Guan, your marriage must have been arranged by your parents, through a matchmaker. Guan Yaowu heard these words and perked up with interest, shaking his head: No, if we were to use a new term, your sister-in-law and I even went through a passionate romance, you could say it was a free marriage, right? You Qing said: This is really fresh, our Brother Guan, had a free romance. We want to hear about it. Guan Yaowu stretched out his thumb, straightened his waist, and said: That’s for sure. Your sister-in-law and I are even cousins, and we have had feelings for each other since we were children. Although I didn’t thoroughly understand Confucius's Analects and Mencius in private school, I did like to read novels, like how Lin Daiyu and Jia Baoyu are cousins who long for each other, I know about that. Naturally, we followed that path. Tian Qing said: In that case, our sister-in-law was Lin Daiyu back then, and Brother Guan was Jia Baoyu. Saying this, he stood next to him, half-squatted down, put one hand on his shoulder, and the other on the back of his foot to compare, and laughed: What a big Jia Baoyu. This caused everyone in the field, including Guan Yaowu, to laugh. Yin Deren said: That kid is just mischievous like that. (346)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e298">Burial of My Child <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Jian</p>
<p>In the early summer of the twentieth year, Yuer, the only fruit of my marriage, was snatched away by death due to measles. Now, in the blink of an eye, it has been almost two years, but Yuer's lovely face and pleasant voice are still lingering in my mind, constantly. At this time, when a poor couple is cold-heartedly facing each other, I think of the joy that Yuer brought me when he was alive, and I cannot help but sadly shed tears.</p>
<p>This is truly a tragic scene. In that busy period of silkworm farming, my wife helped her parents raise silkworms, doing the work of picking mulberry leaves and feeding them. She was busy all day long, and I had a bout of coughing up blood because I ate fermented rice wine. Therefore, Yuer contracted measles and was initially left at his parents' home, practically leaving it to nature and not taking it seriously. Only when the illness worsened did we hire a cheap doctor to diagnose the illness. However, after taking the medicine, not only did it not improve, but also because of the superstition of the old saying that measles would be cured by sweating, medicine was boiled next to the sickbed. The upstairs in early summer was already very hot, and with the added heat of the charcoal fire, it was even more unbearable. Yuer's weak body was forced into a state of dizziness due to the hot fire.</p>
<p>My wife initially feared that I would be anxious during my illness, so she concealed Yuer's condition. It was not until this time that she told me the truth. Pitifully, when I heard the news, I rushed to my parents-in-law's house. My plump and lively Yuer had become so thin that he looked like a different person. His breath was wheezing, his eyes were half-open and half-closed, and the sound of phlegm in his throat was rattling. I could not help but feel a surge of bitterness rising from the bottom of my heart, floating to my nose and to my eyelids. I touched his hot head with my hand and tremblingly called "A Yuer!" When Yuer heard me, he opened his tired little eyes and looked at me, and a sound of "Papa!" burst out of his rattling throat. The tears I had tried so hard to hold back could not help but fall straight down. Alas! Yuer's illness had already reached a very dangerous point, but my finances were originally limited. At that time, I was taking medicine because of my coughing up blood and felt it difficult to manage, so although Yuer's illness was unusually severe, I was unable to hire a doctor to come and treat him. I could only wrap Yuer up and carry him to the doctor's door to be examined. Yuer's illness was originally extremely vicious, and with the added burden of running around in the wind, the precious medicines such as "Antelope Horn Powder" and "Pearl Yellow Powder" were taken, and the Western medicine ointment was wrapped on his body, but finally, it had no effect. Yuer's little life finally faded away on a bleak morning.</p>
<p>That tragic situation is truly unbearable to recall! I remember that when my wife and I were at the doctor's door and were rejected by the doctor, when a glimmer of hope was completely extinguished, my wife held Yuer and sat in a rickshaw, and I followed behind the car and returned home. Yuer's breath became louder and louder, and his teeth were also clenching with a rattling sound, but when he was hugged into the room, his little eyes, which had been closed for a long time, suddenly opened and looked around, revealing a reluctant expression. My wife held him in her arms and could not help but cry sadly, and I also cried aloud. Although Yuer's breath gradually weakened, his open eyes, besides bursting out tears, were still wide open and unwilling to close. Yuer was indeed reluctant to leave his poor parents, but I was unable to hire a famous doctor to save this weak little life because of financial constraints. My wife and I sat on either side of the cradle, crying and watching his little soul fade away.</p>
<p>At that time, I could not bear to bury this bit of flesh and blood in the public cemetery, so I temporarily placed him in the funeral parlor, preparing to return him to the family cemetery in winter. However, in the winter, the national crisis of January 28th, following the September 18th Incident, suddenly descended upon us. In that era of war and danger, the burial was put on hold. Then I suffered another bout of typhoid fever. The movie theater that I relied on for a living was also sold entirely due to poor business. I struggled to make a living in an unemployed environment, and my finances became even more difficult. Therefore, Yuer's burial was put on hold until last year when I found a job as an editor at a newspaper. In an environment of extreme austerity, I saved 30 yuan, so on the day of the Double Tenth Festival's holiday last year, my wife and I went to the grave, talked to the grave keeper about the cost of burying Yuer and the date, and decided to prepare to bury Yuer, to end a long-held worry.</p>
<p>Because my coughing up blood relapsed, the burial fee became the medicine fee, but since the burial had already been agreed upon, it was difficult to change the agreement. I managed to scrape together 20 yuan in the midst of difficulties. In that cold winter, on the desolate side of the ancestral cemetery, I watched as the small coffin was buried in the mound of yellow earth. My wife's crying shook the forest, the wind roared, people wept, my eyelids were attacked by sourness, and slowly filled with hot tears. The surrounding scenery gradually, gradually, changed from clear to a blurry mess.</p>

<h3 id="e299">Transformation of Relations Between the US and Japan <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Mingtang</p>
<p>Recently, what has caused a stir internationally is likely the transformation of relations between the US and Japan.</p>
<p>The transformation of relations between the US and Japan - how unexpected this is! The tension between the US and Japan did not begin today. Since the end of the Great War, the parallel development of American and Japanese capitalism has meant that the two imperialist powers have had extremely acute contact. This contact reached an unprecedented level of tension after the September 18th Incident two years ago. One side wanted to dominate East Asia exclusively; the other wanted to share East Asian interests, which meant that the United States wanted to occupy a position in the international division of East Asia, and a very important position at that. The excessive expansion of Japanese imperialism threatened to prevent the realization of this American attempt. This was, of course, absolutely intolerable to the United States. Therefore, Japan became the only obstacle to American development, and at the same time, the United States became the only target of Japanese struggle. Mutually opposed and mutually fighting, the tension in US-Japan relations created the only crisis of war in East Asia. The US-Japan war was on almost everyone's lips. As 1935 approaches in an instant, the issue of revising the London Naval Treaty and the issue of the Japanese mandated territory in the South Seas have become major hidden reefs in the future of the Pacific. It seemed that the contradiction between Japanese and American imperialism could never be resolved, and that a second world war would inevitably break out in East Asia first.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in this extremely tense atmosphere, there was news of a sudden transformation in US-Japan relations. What interesting and unexpectedly sudden news this is!</p>
<p>What exactly is being sold in the gourd regarding the transformation of US-Japan relations? In my opinion, this is nothing remarkable; at most, it is just another manifestation of the active war preparations of international imperialism!</p>
<p>How do you explain this?</p>
<p>First, we must know that we have already reached the eve of the Second World War. This war will inevitably destroy some of the great powers, or even all of them. So, how can we occupy a particularly advantageous position in the Second World War and avoid the fate of destruction? This has become a hot topic of discussion among the imperialist powers. They know that war is inevitable, but they are not willing to act rashly, because they know that in the next war, carelessness could lead to decline. The so-called "plan before you move," and now is the time for them to "plan." The reason why none of them are willing to start a fire for the time being is because the "plan" has not yet been "determined." Once the plan is determined, they will immediately start the war. This is one.</p>
<p>Since the current international political and economic situation is in the planning phase before the next world war, that is, in preparing for war, then the significance of the so-called understanding between Japan and the United States is also knowable. That is to say, the understanding between Japan and the United States is a manifestation of this "plan." How do we know this? Because the contradictions between Britain and the United States inevitably force the United States to divert some of its strength to deal with Europe; and the fact that "Manchuria and Mongolia" have not been actively "developed" and the existence of the state of opposition to the Soviet Union make it impossible for Japan to divert some of its strength to deal with the Soviet Union and "build" its so-called "Manchuria and Mongolia." In this way, the understanding between Japan and the United States becomes necessary. The reason why they want to understand each other is precisely for the sake of how to occupy a particularly advantageous position for themselves in the future war. Once preparations are completed, the war will begin. This is a definite fact. This is two.</p>
<p>Since the current world has reached the eve of war as a whole, and the so-called understanding between Japan and the United States is just another manifestation of the great powers' war preparations, then the future of the so-called understanding between Japan and the United States can be imagined. On the contrary, this is not a harbinger of peace, but a step further in promoting the world crisis.</p>
<p>Don't believe it? The world economic panic is deepening day by day. Where is the way out for the entire capitalist system? Except for war!</p>
<p>What is noteworthy is the position of China! As a result of the US-Japan understanding, I am afraid it is not a reconciliation between the two countries, but an agreement to divide China equally? Isn't that right? The first sound of the US-Japan understanding is that the United States is preparing to recognize the so-called "Manchukuo"!</p>
<h3 id="e300">A Model for Beggars <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>A few days ago, the private Wuxun Middle School in Tangyi County, Shandong Province, sent a commemorative volume of Mr. Wuxun. As a beggar, he was able to overcome the cold, hunger, and hardship to achieve his meritorious work in educating talents. He is truly worthy of being a good model for beggars. His brief biography and photo are printed below.</p>
<p>Portrait of Mr. Wuxun</p>
<p>Mr. Wuxun was born in a farmer's family in Wuzhuang, north of Tangyi City, Shandong Province. His family was poor. When he was a few years old, his father, Mr. Zongyu, passed away. He and his mother, Cui, and his elder brothers, Qianci and Rang, struggled to make a living. When he was just twenty years old, he was hired in other villages. He used the money he earned to buy delicious food for his mother. Sometimes, his master praised him for his hard work and gave him delicious food, which he would always bring back to his mother. Later, he was hired at his sister's house and served for several years. His sister's husband deceived him for his foolishness and concealed his wages. Mr. Wuxun did not argue with him and quit his job. He was then hired at the home of a student surnamed Mou in the northeast of Guantao City. From spring to winter, he was not paid his wages. Mr. Wuxun endured until the following year, but Mou was still the same, not paying him a penny and being harsh to him. Mr. Wuxun was very depressed. He lay in the mill room for several days without speaking or eating, and then quit his job. He seemed to be crazy. People would ask his name, but he would not answer and called himself "Justice of Righteous School."</p>
<p>In the early years of Tongzhi's reign, his mother passed away. He and his brothers lived separately. He only had three acres of land, which he sold for 120 strings of cash. Together with the money he had earned from hiring, he had a total of 210 strings of cash. He knew that Lou Junling of Guantao was virtuous, so he went to his door to ask him to manage the money for him, saying, "This is the money I earned from hiring to build a righteous school. Please do not refuse!" Mr. Lou did not know him and refused, but he knelt down and persisted, so he agreed.</p>
<p>From then on, he gave up hiring and became a beggar. Mr. Wuxun did not keep a braid. He only left hair on his forehead in the shape of a peach, and shaved it irregularly on the left and right sides. He wore a ragged cloak, carried a copper spoon, and wore a hundred-patched coat. He traveled through the city streets, calling out for work to make a living, or performing skills to earn money, or picking up broken threads and remnants to make thread balls. Over time, people knew Mr. Wuxun's personality and respected him very much. He often went in and out of the homes of ordinary people. Even women in their boudoirs did not avoid him. Therefore, he often acted as a matchmaker. If he begged for better food, he would sell it to get money. If he begged for scraps, he would eat it himself. If he had nothing, he would fill his stomach with vegetable roots and taro tails, or even snakes, scorpions, tiles, and pebbles. If someone gave him clean water to drink, he would wash his face first and then drink it. He went to great lengths to suffer himself, and accumulated wealth over the years.</p>
<p>Later, his accumulated wealth gradually increased, and he successively purchased land. Some people advised him to marry, but he firmly refused. He continued to beg and had no fixed place to stay. One night, he stayed in a dilapidated temple in Mijiatang Village. Unfortunately, a tile fell from the roof of the temple and injured his head. He still sang and encouraged himself. During the day, he went to the city and spoke in rhyme, like songs and poems, always advocating the creation of righteous schools.</p>
<p>In the early years of Guangxu's reign, he had accumulated tens of thousands of dollars, but his clothes were still worn and his food was still coarse. At this time, Mr. Wuxun used his accumulated wealth to purchase some red grain. His brother asked his neighbors to borrow money, but Mr. Wuxun refused. He leased the land he had purchased to his brother, but did not accept money. So, Mr. Xing quit his job. Also, Gao, a resident of Xierzhuang in Guantao, owed Mr. Wuxun more than 200 strings of cash in principal and interest. He repeatedly refused to pay and even threatened Mr. Wuxun to sue him. Mr. Wuxun decided not to ask for it anymore. In the winter of the twelfth year, he purchased more than 230 acres of land and asked Yang Shufang, a resident of Liulin Town, to recruit tenants to cultivate the land and manage the rest of his assets.</p>
<p>When Mr. Wuxun first proposed to build a school, he bought a house site in Wuzhuang, valued at 670 strings of cash. Because he felt that the situation was too narrow and feared that the Wu family would seize it in the future, he asked Mr. Yang to choose a school site in Liulin Town. Guo Junfen donated 1.8 acres of land outside the Dongwei Gate in the town. He built 24 houses and a gate and wall. It was completed in less than a month. He hired famous teachers to teach, and scholars gathered there. Every time Mr. Wuxun invited a teacher to the door, he would bow and greet him and treat him with a rich feast. If the teacher was tired and sleepy, he would kneel beside the bed. If the teacher returned to his hometown for some reason and was late returning to school, Mr. Wuxun would rush to his home day and night and kneel down to ask him respectfully. If a student was lazy, he would persuade him when others were not watching. If he did not listen, he would kneel down and beg him! Therefore, the diligence of teachers and students in the school was the best of the time. He expanded the righteous school to the neighboring counties. Mr. Wuxun became more diligent in accumulating wealth. Liao Zheng, a monk at the Qianfo Temple in Zhuangkecun, Guantao, admired Mr. Wuxun's character and donated all his savings. Therefore, he purchased more than 100 acres of land and a house in Yang Erzhuang, and built more than 10 houses. He hired teachers to teach as in the righteous school in Liulin. At that time, Guo Gong, the magistrate of Tangyi County, heard of Mr. Wuxun's name and invited him to the yamen to treat him to a feast. This was the first time in Mr. Wuxun's life that he had a good meal. Also, Yu De, a vice minister, came to Dong to inspect the school. Mr. Wuxun persuaded him to donate and he generously donated 200 taels of silver. With the support of the gentry in Linqing County, he purchased a house in Yushi Lane in Linqing City. Before the matter was completed, Mr. Wuxun passed away. Fortunately, Mr. Wang Pixian continued to operate and fulfilled Mr. Wuxun's legacy. When Mr. Wuxun was ill, his nephew Kexin went to see him, but Mr. Wuxun did not speak to him. Before his death, he still glared at him.</p>
<p>According to the records, Mr. Wuxun was born on the 19th day of the tenth month of the eighteenth year of Daoguang's reign at the hour of Mao (5-7 AM), and died on the 23rd day of the fourth month of the twenty-second year of Guangxu's reign at the hour of Wu (11 AM-1 PM). According to his will, he was buried outside the east wall of the righteous school he built in Liulin Town, Tangyi County. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3 id="e301">Women and Crying <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>"Heroes don't shed tears lightly" - this indicates that a tough man does not cry easily, showing a heart of stone. However, women are different. Women are very prone to tears, especially in front of men. Women's tears are even more readily available. It is no exaggeration to say that women and crying are two-in-one. This is almost always the case.</p>
<p>Whenever women encounter unsatisfactory situations or excessive stimulation, they disregard everything and cry loudly, using crying as the only method of self-comfort. Men are not entirely the same. Under the same circumstances, they can only grit their teeth and endure in silence, trying to find a way to deal with the situation. This is not to say that men do not cry, but women cry much more often than men. Crying is not entirely a bad thing. When a person's mood is extremely depressed and cannot be vented, they always want to be able to cry loudly, as if all the sorrow and troubles can be cried out, and they will feel much more comfortable afterwards. This may have some physiological benefits, which may explain why people sometimes like to cry. However, women's particular fondness for crying, and the reason why women cry, in addition to the above reasons, has another meaning. This meaning is limited to the relationship between women and men. Under these circumstances, women's crying has an unbelievable magical power. Smart women use it as a portable treasure to deal with men. The saying "a woman's tears can melt a hero's heart" is clear evidence. We can often see between couples and lovers that when they argue about something, the woman cannot overcome the man, but is unwilling to back down or admit defeat. So, she releases her final weapon, collapsing on the bed and sobbing softly, or crying loudly in the presence of heaven and earth, tearfully telling her story as if she has been wronged, regardless of whether she is right or wrong. At this time, the man sees her pitiful and charming appearance. He cannot help but hate and love her at the same time, but the love is always greater than the hate. His hard heart is softened by the crying. He regrets causing trouble and needlessly stirring up a storm. So, not only will he automatically cancel his anger, but he will naturally approach the woman, stroke her hair, and comfort her with a humble attitude, saying a lot of nice things. Then, the victory belongs entirely to her, and the woman feels satisfied. So, she immediately turns from crying to laughter, and the tragicomic drama ends. Women's crying is really the best means of dealing with men, and also the most sharp and powerful method. Moreover, crying is originally very contagious. When you hear someone crying, you cannot help but feel sympathy or sadness for them, because people are all emotional, unless you are a piece of wood. Not to mention women's crying, which is rich in rhythm and gentle and tactful. No matter how heartless and unfeeling a man is, he will be moved by a woman's crying. Therefore, crying is a unique skill of women, a clever skill used to deal with men.</p>

<p>After Mr. Guo heard what Steward Ding said, he repeatedly said, "Yes!" He immediately took the account book and ran to Xiao En's house like a dog. This is exactly: "The rich raise slaves like dogs: they run as soon as they are called!" He only knows "obeying orders" and "submitting" in his life!</p>
<p>Mr. Guo arrived at Xiao's house: Xiao En greeted him respectfully, and Guiying quickly served tea; but he sat down rudely and spread out the account book with a fierce face to demand money. Xiao En pleaded repeatedly: he only allowed him to pay tomorrow; but interest must be added.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Spring Dream <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Qiao</p>
<p>Spring, intoxicating spring, last night's dream was too surprising.</p>
<p>Heavy rain hit the window, it was already dusk. I lay in the sofa chair chewing on Micoli candy, gazing absently at a spring fashion picture. Women are all lovely, with slender figures, wearing such narrow cheongsams, they raise their two lotus root-like fleshy arms, turn their heads, and wink at you, as if saying: "Love me, I am a youthful girl!"</p>
<p>Smiling, I lit a cigarette and also squinted one eye at her. She seemed to be laughing at me, laughing at me for not having enough courage, why not hug the girl you love tightly? Foolish, it's a picture. I flipped through, and picture after picture rolled before my eyes, those were such light and graceful girls.</p>
<p>"Girls are indeed beautiful,</p>
<p>Indeed they are light and graceful,</p>
<p>Indeed embracing her, kissing her,</p>
<p>Can comfort the fatigue of your life."</p>
<p>Holding the picture album, I closed my eyes, smoking a cigarette, listening to the rain, I seemed to be snuggling in my lover's arms, hypnotized.</p>
<p>The door opened, and that light and graceful girl wearing the clothes from the spring fashion picture, smiling and gazing at me, so charming. She stood still for a long time, seeing that I did not move, she stepped lightly with a waltz step, smiling even more charmingly. At this moment, I did not ask who she was, I stood up and hugged her. She leaned in my arms as if boneless, raised her head, slightly closed her long eyelashes, and a smile appeared at the corner of her mouth, she was waiting for me, waiting for me, for a passionate, intoxicating kiss.</p>
<p>However, I cannot be too presumptuous, towards a girl, one should gently caress and tenderly cherish, then kiss her, she will be grateful for your kindness. She remained for a long time, as if she had stopped breathing, she slightly opened her eyes, and met mine, she slightly closed them again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a Roman warrior appeared before me at the door, he drew his sword and stabbed at me. The girl quickly broke free from my embrace, stood between the two of us, shook her head, looked at the warrior with resentment and glared at him, the warrior weakly retracted his sword, grabbed the girl's arm and walked out. The door slammed shut and I woke up from my dream.</p>
<p>Holding the spring fashion picture album in my arms, half a cigarette was smoldering in the ashtray, emitting a foul smell, the sound of rain on the window had not stopped, looking at the clock, it was only a five-minute dream, and I returned to this small room. I flipped through the picture album directly to the page with the girl, with the same appearance as in the dream, squinting her eyes at me, saying: "Love me, I am a youthful girl!"</p>
<p>I threw the spring fashion album maliciously onto the bed, the Roman warrior on the cover was drawing his sword and wrestling with someone. I laughed, picked up a Micoli candy and chewed it slowly.</p>

<p>— Cai Tonghua</p>
<p>"More than a decade ago, they also opposed Japan, as if they opposed the Twenty-One Demands? It's so fast, just a blink of an eye."</p>
<p>"Yes, at that time the students also came to the countryside to give speeches, and burned Japanese goods in the city, everyone hated Japan, even I had that..."</p>
<p>Speaking of burning Japanese goods, Ah Xing recalled when he was a child, he followed the adults to the city to watch the burning of Japanese goods, it was extremely lively. Besides the people watching, there were also speculative vendors in the distance, competing to sell food. Although it was a sea of people, those colorful candy stalls were not as attractive as the students wearing Western clothes, supervising and directing with authority. The things to be burned were piled up as high as a small mountain. When they were burned, each emitted different lights. When burning wine, the pale purple flame was especially high and beautiful. The young children cheered loudly; at that time, Ah Xing also felt that it was more interesting than carrying the gods in a procession. Although he could not fully understand the meaning of burning Japanese goods, everyone was very excited, as excited as they were during a gang fight, as if they had burned the enemy's family alive and burned the enemy's houses, it was so satisfying; this past event was deeply stored in Ah Xing's mind.</p>
<p>"If the people from other villages know about this, it would be so embarrassing. Our whole village would become traitors. I think we should give the Anti-Japanese Association a warning," Brother Shun said solemnly.</p>
<p>"What warning, confiscate him, damn it, didn't the students who came to the countryside tell us this?" Ah Gen said. His stubborn and brave personality, like his body, grew up from fists, scolding, and bullying.</p>
<p>The old people looked at each other, rolled their eyes, and contained contempt and horror, as if saying: "Smelly brats, only know how to gossip, little devils who don't know how to live or die."</p>
<p>"Ah Gen, be careful! Their sanitary pills will send you to heaven."</p>
<p>Ah Xing did not agree with Jia Xiao's opinion, but he also opposed Ah Gen. He felt that Ah Gen was simply joking.</p>
<p>"................................"</p>
<p>Little Gouzi just moved his mouth, but was stopped by his father's vicious, knife-like gaze. He flushed, swallowed the words in his stomach. The father often supervised his every move. Usually, the father always used his tragic life experience to move and soften his son, trying to subdue the son's inherent rebellious spirit under emotion. Fathers also have their reasons. They believe in the theory that honesty will be rewarded. Feng Bo always maintained his mature and prudent attitude, did not say a word, and led his son towards the way home.</p>
<p>The flickering firelight was already shining in the distance, the sky was completely dark, and the vast fields were swallowed by the god of night.</p>

<h3 id="e307">A List of New Stars in 1934 <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>The arrival of 1934 has brought about obvious changes. In the film industry of Europe and America, especially in the ever-changing Hollywood, the metabolism of stars, with new ones rising and old ones falling, has created a unique situation. The old stars, such as Mary Pickford, Gloria Swanson, and Douglas Fairbanks, have become figures of the past. 1934 has become an era for new stars to compete, although many veteran old stars can still maintain their original positions through continuous efforts, the novelty-seeking audiences have shifted their attention to those rising stars. The following are the lucky ones who have recently jumped onto the silver screen and won the audience's favor. They are now introduced separately as follows.</p>
<p>Mae West (Actress, Paramount) This charming and intelligent young woman possesses a sensitive mind and a uniquely stylish demeanor. She is a skilled screenwriter and has accumulated years of observation and experience, deeply understanding the demands of the general audience in the current century. She understands that this society is a man's world, and she has targeted men as her audience. This experiment has achieved unexpected success. Her two new works, "She Done Him Wrong" and "I'm No Angel," have won the amazement of the world (mostly men). The enthusiasm with which New York's Broadway welcomed her new films made many established stars both jealous and envious, and none were willing to attend. Now, she has become the idol of the general male audience.</p>
<p>Lee Tracy (Actor, Fox) Among the rising male stars, Lee Tracy is probably the most popular with audiences. However, he is not a handsome young man, nor does he excel at winning the hearts of women. Instead, he relies entirely on his lively performance and fluent eloquence to dominate the sound film industry. He is a typical figure in the busy metropolis of New York, with a brisk, straightforward, and refreshing performance style that forms a unique category, winning the enthusiastic love of English-speaking audiences. American film magazines often publish numerous letters from audiences praising him, which is evident. He has only been in the film industry for a short time, with works such as "Nuisance" and "Turn Back The Clock."</p>
<p>Dorothea Wieck (Actress, Paramount) She is a new actress recently brought to Hollywood from Germany. She revealed her great acting talent in the film "Madam in Uniform," representing a typical figure of noble chastity, a character that Hollywood lacks most. Her first starring film in the United States is called "Miss Fane's Baby is Stolen."</p>
<p>Jan Kiepura (Actor, British Gaumont) He is a famous singer in continental Europe, originally from Romania. However, the British promote him as if he were one of their own. In this year when musical films are warmly welcomed by the world, his world-renowned singing voice can naturally win general admiration. He made his debut in the film "Tell Me Tonight," creating a new box office record for European films. It was continuously shown in Shelley Wharf, Australia, for six months. The British also regard it as an honorary production of their country. His new film "City of Song" also achieved good results.</p>
<p>Franchot Tone (Actor, MGM) This handsome young man, dressed in the most fashionable clothes and enjoying extravagant material comforts, is a new figure. He is a typical American wealthy son, a representative of masculinity that white women dream of. Undoubtedly, he has been welcomed by the general female audience. He played the male lead in Joan Crawford's recent new film, "Dancing Lady." It is said that he is already Miss Crawford's lover. It is rumored that Miss Crawford's ex-husband, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., frankly criticized, "I can't find a man more handsome than Franchot Tone!"</p>
<p>Margaret Sullavan (Actress, Universal) This dreamy and beautiful girl only appeared fleetingly in "Only Yesterday," but her beautiful and extraordinary impression has been deeply imprinted in the hearts of the general audience.</p>
<p>Otto Kruger (Actor, 20th Century Fox) He is a popular star on the Broadway stage in New York. He began his screen career in 1933, making six films for 20th Century Fox in one year. He is an amiable middle-aged man, welcomed by the general audience for his profound performance.</p>
<p>June Knight (Actress, Universal) This beautiful and intelligent woman, as radiant as a peach blossom and as cold as ice, is one of the famous female performers on the Broadway stage in New York. She has only been in the film industry for a little over a year. After being promoted by Universal, she was first selected by the master director E.A. Dupont to play the lead role in "Ladies Must Love," and the results were indeed a sensation.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e308">Review of "Who is the Murderer?" <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Gaoyuan</p>
<p>"Matinee Idol" Guang Lu Lan Xin丨</p>
<p>This is the story of a famous actor being murdered out of jealousy.</p>
<p>Why is he envied? Without me saying it, nine out of ten people would guess that it is because of his "exceptional artistry" and "being worshiped by women." As a result, among the pursuers, love turns to hate, leading to the use of a gun to harm the person she loves most.</p>
<p>Such "romantic affairs" are common in modern society. Although the methods and processes of murder are different, the motives are the same. The social cause of this motive is undoubtedly capitalism. The private system of society is reflected in the relationship between men and women, forming an absolute demand for "exclusive possession" between men and women, requiring an extreme development of individualism, and this is what happens.</p>
<p>Here, I am reminded of the recent suicide of Chinese film actress Ai Xia. Although the causes of the motives are similar, fundamentally, failing to clearly recognize the social causes of the suffering and being unable to extricate oneself from the poison of the current society are the same. Social development has its future. People living in it cannot recognize and grasp its future and seek personal solutions, which is impossible.</p>
<p>The creative attitude of the screenwriter and director is still cautious, and they do not carelessly mix things up. A case of jealous murder is not treated like an absurd detective film. The famous actor's lover, Chriske, confesses to protect her sister, who is also her rival in love, Sarnia. In the end, Gotti, the female supporting role who is the murderer and also loves the famous actor, commits suicide by leaving a letter. All of this is possible in terms of emotions and reason. From the murderer's point of view, she is also committing suicide for love.</p>
<p>In addition to this main line, the insertion of Mrs. Cable, the famous actor's neighbor, provides the police with clues to the murderer, which is important, simple, and interesting. It adds a comedic atmosphere to the serious atmosphere, which does not destroy the overall atmosphere but strengthens the power of the whole play. Although most of Mrs. Cable's appearances are at the window, it is very natural. Until the last shot, she is still like an old woman, grumbling, which is not only interesting and gives the audience a natural and relaxed feeling, but also because this kind of character is real in life, this expression is appropriate.</p>
<p>Miles Mander's famous actor has the air of a swordsman. Whether in the foreground, backstage, or in daily life, his performance has the flavor of a "famous actor." Marguerite Allen is affectionate in her lively innocence. Nicola Keats wears black and white spotted clothes as soon as she appears on the stage, emphasizing her terrifying, sinister, and depressed character, and her expressions and movements also carry this meaning. Hay Petrie's male neighbor and Margaret Yarde's female neighbor fully express the characters of their roles through their expressions and movements.</p>
<p>The lighting, set design, and director George King can be matched according to the emotional development of the play, which emphasizes the effect of the play and shows his efforts. The dialogue throughout the play is very clear.</p>
<h3 id="e309">Review of "Bian Kun Gang" <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>丨丨 Guanghua Ying 丨丨</p>
<p>"Bian Kun Gang" is said to be Xu Zhimo's posthumous work, and the screenplay was written by Lu Xiaoman. Therefore, it has attracted considerable attention.</p>
<p>Regarding Xu Zhimo, we cannot deny his contributions to the Chinese literary world. Some people say that he is the representative of Chinese capitalist culture. In culture, we cannot forget Hu Shih, but in literature and art, we must mention Xu Zhimo. Indeed, he has made indelible achievements in introducing Western culture, but what he introduced was all decadent or beginning to decay. Such things are naturally more harmful than beneficial to China. Naturally, Xu Zhimo was a passionate romantic, which can be seen in his poetry. Even if he grasped reality, he distorted it due to incorrect observations, and therefore could not grasp the inevitable development of reality.</p>
<p>However, I regret to say that I have read very little about him, especially the script of "Bian Kun Gang," which I have never read. So now I can only express my humble opinions based on what is presented in the film. Of course, a literary work is often distorted by film merchants. In European and American films, we can cite many examples. Similarly, due to the different expression techniques of films, there are often many discrepancies between literary works, which is also an inevitable fact. Therefore, perhaps the original work is not as similar to the film as it seems. However, the screenwriter, Ms. Lu Xiaoman, should be responsible.</p>
<p>What exactly does "Bian Kun Gang" express? Perhaps it can be said that Bian Kun Gang is a stonemason, but he is an artist in the eyes of poets. After his wife's death, he loves his daughter, A Ming, extraordinarily, and does not want to remarry, lest a stepmother abuse his daughter. But the artist is a filial son. The subtitles say: Because his mother wants Ka Kun Gang to marry the newly widowed Li Qimei, but the picture tells us that he fell in love with Li Qimei after all, so he married her. Later, Li Qimei still refused to settle down as before and had relations with a shopkeeper. As a result, Ka Kun Gang's mother died of anger, and his daughter was blinded and killed by the adulterer and adulteress. Then the adulterer and adulteress eloped, and Ka Kun Gang committed suicide by jumping into a well in a fit of anger. At this time, his apprentice, filled with righteous indignation, wanted to avenge his master in the heavy rain. However, the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small. Li Qimei and the shopkeeper were struck to death by lightning in the woods, and the apprentice arrived, and there was no need to take action.</p>
<p>That's the story. Although a blind man is added to it, laughing coldly and mockingly, it makes people even more confused. I think this is unnecessary to explain. In the current Chinese films, there are still films that promote shallow loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness, and the vulgar karma of cause and effect, which is a strange phenomenon in the film industry.</p>
<p>Now let's see what the director has given us? Just give one example; after Li Qimei married Ka Kun Gang, why was she restless? How was she restless? And why did his mother die of anger? None of these are explained on the screen. In addition to rambling on and on in the instructions, our director just cleverly used a subtitle to end it.</p>
<p>As for the protagonist's performance, it is pretentious from beginning to end, with some of the flavor of an iron rooster and some of the flavor of singing civilized operas. The heroine has some merits of a rural woman in the first part, but the latter part is also not good. The others are self-evident.</p>
<h3 id="e310">"Flames" to be Released Tomorrow <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>Indeed, Yi Hua Film Company is bold!</p>
<p>Because large-scale films are rarely attempted in China, and Yi Hua Film Company's debut work, "The Fury of the Chinese Sea," is not only large-scale but also set in the vast ocean, which makes it even more magnificent. Now, another film more magnificent than "The Fury of the Chinese Sea" has been released, and this film is also produced by Yi Hua Film Company, which is "Flames," directed by Hu Rui and starring Peng Fei and Hu Ping.</p>
<p>The director of "Flames" is relaxed and sharp, the actors' expressions are calm and lively, and the photography is beautiful and novel. Everything about it is very extraordinary. This film has been approved by the Nanjing Film Inspection Committee and will be released at the Beijing Grand Theater tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e311">Silver Rain <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>

<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>"Are women obedient in the North?" Will asked incredulously. He thought, can a person freely choose between the South and the North? Joanna smiled and asked, "You hate the North the most, don't you?" Will said seriously, "They destroyed us!" Joanna said, "You weren't even born at that time. Mr. Will, your memory is really strong!" Will was a little annoyed, and he said, "You think that's good, don't you?" Joanna said, "Why do you care so much?" Will was very unhappy in his heart, but he still pretended to smile on the outside and said, "Okay, today's lesson is over." Joanna jumped down from the fence and said, "The lesson is over, the teacher can go home." Will quickly stopped her and said, "Don't go. You're right, Joanna; I'm very sorry. Now we'll just laugh it off." Joanna smiled at him slightly. Will urged her, "Why don't you laugh? Have you forgiven me?" So they laughed heartily and patrolled the tobacco in the field together.</p>
<p>Many of the early plantings were her father's handiwork and are now in bloom. Joanna smelled the fragrance of the tobacco flowers and praised them repeatedly. Will said, "Honestly, we don't like growing tobacco." Joanna glanced at him and said, "You don't grow anything at all. The fields are full of weeds." Will said, "That's all because we don't have money. Thanks to the North, they are determined to harm the South... Has your grandmother told you?" Joanna said, "No, she said that both sides were wrong in the North-South War." Will said, "I'm afraid your grandmother doesn't like Southerners, does she?" Joanna said, "No. She was originally going to marry a Southerner. Later, that person died in battle, so she ran to the North and married my grandfather. But she never forgot her first love for the rest of her life." Will thought that Florence was coming soon, so he said, "A person's marriage rarely allows them to be their own master." Joanna said, "Then why do people get married at all?" Will said, "There are many reasons... money is one of them..." Joanna said angrily, "Money? You don't need to sacrifice your happiness for money. You just need to work hard yourself." Will grabbed her arm and jumped over a field bank, and then said, "You are a very special person. Please tell me, how can you cultivate a field like this without money?" Joanna said, "Put all the fields together and tidy them up..." Will waved his hand and laughed before she could finish, "Plant a large area of tobacco!" Joanna said, "Do you think it's funny? I don't think it's funny. Growing tobacco is extremely profitable." Will was still joking, "A man can only smoke one cigarette at a time. Who will use so much tobacco that you grow? Do you even call women to smoke?" Joanna laughed and said, "That's also possible. You don't know, the tobacco I grow is originally for making cigarettes."</p>
<p>As they were arguing vigorously, Robert came forward and called Will to the station to meet Florence. So Will said goodbye to Joanna unhappily and left. Joanna sat down on the field bank, and unconsciously felt something in her heart, her eyes staring blankly at Will's receding figure. (To be continued)</p>
