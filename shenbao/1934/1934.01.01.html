<p>— 華</p>
<p>一般人之心理。類以過去種種。結束於除夕。方來一切。開始於歲朝。是以每當歲序更新之際。人人懷希望。家家多朝氣。氣象一新。頗有發揚蹈厲之槪。茲者民國二十二年巳成陳跡。二十三年方自今日開殆。國人當此新歲。心頭果能發生阿種希望乎。此値得一問者也。</p>
<p>目下國内。農村凋零。工商敝疲。外患日亟。内憂益深。丁此時艱。凡於精神上巳受痛創者。恐雖在元旦。亦祇有悲觀。鮮有希望之可言矣。然而希望爲積極奮鬥之推動力。苟無希望。活動便無源泉。縱欲努力。亦乏鵠的。其結果則惟有委心任運。頽然自廢而已。故吾人爲社會進步計。深願國人當茲多難之歲首。仍勿放棄其前途之希望。鼓其其勇氣。堅其意志。向前孟晋。以挽過去之失敗。</p>
<p>希望人各不同。甚成相反。然對於自己之民族。自己之國家。希望其生存與繁榮。則未有不同者。何也。蓋民族與國家之生存與繁榮。除少數賣國求榮以圖苟延殘喘者外。實爲任何人任何團體。達其進步與崇高之希望之前得也。否則皮之不存。毛將焉附。個人與團體。皆將因失所庇護。而莫由實現其希望矣。</p>
<p>在今日危難之中國。吾人不欲放言高論。亦不敢過存奢望。故所希望者。亦至簡單。卽在一致團結一致對外。以維吾民族之生存。而徐圖使之發展耳。欲求全國一致團結。雖其道甚多。更僕難數。但首要者。在除去團結之障礙。欲除障礙。則不能不望各方捐棄私恨。赤心爲國。求内爭之早息。蓋若内爭不息。則自相殘殺之根不除。寗有團結之可能。至於一致對外。在今日之中國。祇須有略具領袖材能者。誠意指導。尙非難事。蓋中國自九一八以來。創巨痛深。民心悲憤。國民對於［一致對外］。望之已久。惟恐求之而不得也。</p>
<p>去年歲暮。嘗翻閱李劍農氏舊著[最近三十年中國政治史]一書。不禁萬感蒼茫。不知涕泗之何從。書之最後一節。曰［今後之去路］。讀之尢深感慨。茲錄其數語於後。</p>
<p>［在我們的面前。明明白白。祇有兩條路。丨一條是死路。一條是活路。······活的路是怎麽様。第一就是停止無意義的相互屠殺。回復社會之安定。·····第二要保持社會的安定。必須使社會一般優秀分子有言論上建議和批評之自由。使社會一般的人民。有辨别是非的機會。養成社會辨别是非的能力。才能發生有力量的輿論。·····］</p>
<p>［我們現時處在死活兩條路的分岐上。全民族的死活。全操在領導者的手中。假使各位的領導者。有擁護民族的誠心。應該認清楚這個死活的分岐點。一般的社會優秀分子。也應該認清楚這個死活的分岐點。中國的民族。才有永續繁榮的希望。這是今後的去路觀。］</p>
<p>［擾亂的局面越延長。文化就越停滯。生産勞力和資本越減退。帝國主義的勢力越擴大］。</p>
<p>［亂事再延長下去。中國的人民。除了作外國生産品的消費機械。替外國人作馬牛。供外國人的奔走驅使以外。還有别的辦法麽。這不是中國民族社會一條死路麽］。</p>
<p>李氏此書。出版於民國十九年十月。歲月不居。時易勢變。今日之情形。已與當時大不相同。固矣。然吾民族處於生死二途之分岐點上。尙未脫險則一。豈惟尙未脫險。或且比較從前。益陷於危殆之境。故在今日而言希望。其言似仍有參考之價値。至少亦足資國人反省與敬惕。</p>
<h3 id="c2">一九三四年的展望 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 晦</p>
<p>一，憂患相迫尙無已時，</p>
<p>我們中國呼號國難，已經臨到第四個年頭了，在過去三年中我們試自己檢閱我們的情形究竟何如，國難是否因爲國人的呼號而减輕其嚴重，敵人是否顧忌我們的呼號而不敢再行侵略；在事實上昭示我們，國難匪但没有减輕，而且更加嚴重，東三省的變故依然如舊，並且還有更見嚴重的形勢，恐怕丢了熱河還不能了結，察東的警報，卽其明證。因爲日本現時所處的國際地位和牠國内的情形，都不容牠再作軍事的冒險，以兵力來奪占的市塲，在我們中國，固然不能以破敗不堪的國民經濟，來發動對外鬭爭，在遠東爭勝的各强國，更不能抛棄本國不顧，而驟用武力鬭爭，可是外交上的運用，經濟上的牽制，却非常之激劇，假使日本眞用武力以刧持遠東市塲，則起而以經濟力壓迫日本的，將不止太平洋彼岸的北美合衆國，卽對日本時且戒心的英吉利，也難保不聯美以制日，北方的蘇聯，更要乘機而對日加以突擊了。所以日本又用和平之名，說是刷新外交，以緩和世界各國對日關係之再行惡化。</p>
<p>不過日本之所謂大陸政策，雖然因爲外交上的環境惡劣，暫時不採取積極的態度，事實上祇是南進政策略現頓化而已，於北方，特别是對内蒙，對北滿，依然十分急進，卽使短時期内不用兵，其政治的醞釀，却還是猛進不已，我們看牠外務省新設的調查部，特别注重亞細亞的調查，在亞細亞的調查中又格外着意於内蒙古一帶，由此我們就知道這一問題非比尋常了。</p>
<p>然則，我們自己到底何如呢？一九三三年最不祥的一年已經在狂風駭浪之中勉强挨過去，今年怎様呢？就一般的情形看，特别是在經濟上，過去了年，中國的經濟可說是頽敗到了極點，遍全國各大小城市，没有一處不歎息市面不好，現狀難於支持，農村呢，無論是豐收的地方，或是荒旱的地方，都深感着破産的危機迫在眉睫，竟至於没有自全的道路！今年該怎様，據巳往以推測將來，恐怕還是悲觀的成分，多過樂觀的成分。一則就世界現狀考察，市面轉好的象徵還是靠不大住；再則中國本身，也没有單獨轉換的可能，所以城市上的工商業和鄕村間的農業，都正陷於恐慌深淵之中，而未見底止。</p>
<p>二，一九三六年危險的前夜，</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌的深化，巳經傳染到了中國，在先進諸國中，因爲牠們歷史的抗力，因爲牠們人工的敷衍，表面上好像漸次趨於穩定，尤其是英美和日本，都似乎恐慌狂潮快要過去的様子；但是我們細究其實際，就曉得英國在牠國内的失業問題，并不曾眞正得到解决，而目前穩定底力。到底是非常脆弱，單以放棄金本位制，和實行英帝國内的聯盟而論，就足以證明物價提高並不能救産業界之窮乏，也不能刺激一般社會大衆的消費能力，至於英帝國内的經濟聯盟中，還包含着各自治領各殖民地之離心傾向，則是目前的穩定局面的實在性，是很單薄了。在北美合衆國自從實行其藍鷹運動之後，産業復興好像有可能似的，去年九月其失業人數，也由一千一百五十餘萬减到一千零七十萬；物價在去年十一月與前年同時期相比，由六八增加到八八；工業生産指數（如以一九二八年爲基凖）去年九月與前年同時期相比，也由五九增加到七五；這些似乎都是轉好的現象，都是今年將要繁榮再來的象徵。但是我們試進一層去研究，就明白物價的提高，是因爲通貨膨脹的原故，工業生産指數增加，乃是人工的刺激，商品不過從這一所堆棧搬到那一所堆棧去，實際上並不曾落到消費者手裏。則是産業復興法的作用，也可說是極其微細，至於講到克服經濟恐慌，那就更遠了。</p>
<p>日本的經濟情形，比之英美，比之其他資本主義國家，好像都更强些，如同以一九二八年爲基凖，去年八月其工業生産指數與前年同時期比較增加二四，物價也由前年的一三四，去年增加到一四三，失業人數則减少了十五萬人。不過我們知道日本朝野上下狂呌着［非常時期］，［超非常時期］，［一九三六年的危機的到來一，以刺激其民衆，以麻醉其産業界；其他一方面則擴張預算，大發其公債丨卽通貨膨脹政策，使貨幣價値减低，無形中提高了物價，再加軍需工業的興起，起軍事的消費，轉移到社會上去，於是軍需品的堆積，軍需品的繼續製造，就掩飾過了商品騰積的景象。非常時期的戰爭狂，就掩着了一時間生活上的痛苦。究其實際，在日本的經濟恐慌，依然擴展，一般社會的生活，同受着嚴重的壓迫，恐慌的危機，正是一天比一天嚴重，我們看牠去年十個月間檢舉犯罪案件，在日本本國就有一百十八萬件，其中因政治關係，思想問題而犯罪的不用講是由經濟恐慌的關係出來的，卽中小學校敎員校長的受賄，大學校的出賣博士學位，等等貪汚的事情，何嘗不是緣因於經濟關係。然則日本所謂獨特的經濟繁榮，又那裏有什麽確實性質？在政治上的動搖不安，議會政治老早就碰了壁，不能取得人民的信仰，軍閥的强力，也是外强中乾，旣不能完全制服財閥，也不能眞正統一牠的軍事，所以牠在政治上，在經濟上的重重難關，也與其他各國一様，不過變換了一個名詞，呌做非常時期罷。</p>
<p>三，今年的趨向，</p>
<p>現在世界各國中，無論是資本主義的先進國，或後進國，以至於殖民地，半殖民地，過去三年間都呻吟於市面不好的環境中，雖想盡了種種方法，也還是不能自㧞。獨有蘇聯奮其全國人民之力，拚命要在資本主義圍困之中，建設社會主義的道路，牠的人民節衣縮食的結果，居然在世界經濟恐慌中造成了與各國不同的好景象。其他世界一般的趨勢，大約可以分列爲以下幾項··</p>
<p>一美國已經公佈，承認了白銀恊定，在今後四年之中，美國將購進白銀二千四百四十二萬一千盎斯，同時以各礦山産銀百分之五十用於鑄幣；則今後，白銀與美金之比價，可以提高，換言之，卽美國通貨價値，可以因此减低，一般購買力亦可以就此昇高，市面的繁榮，也從而可以期待了。殊不知實際上却未必如此，第一因爲最高與最低工資的規定，已限制着了一般人的所得，卽　　令工資與幣價同等增加，物價也同様昇騰，結果還不是一様的嗎？何况銀價提高之後，特别是在東方用銀的中國，貨幣價値提高之後，物價隨之低落，一般人的消費能力，將不免更見低落。恐怕經濟恐慌的趨勢，今年比去年還要更厲害些亦未可知。</p>
<p>二　銀價恊定，雖然得到了美印兩國的批准，可是貨幣戰爭依然繼續，通貨穩定的方法，仍舊不易求得，加以金本位國和非金位國的對立，則是貨幣戰爭將轉化而爲關稅戰爭！關稅戰爭愈激烈，則經濟聯盟的對立，就更會嚴重。英帝國經濟聯盟已經有了相當的根基，美國則必然努力於約束南北美洲；各使其勢力範圍堅强，并竭力向外發展。日本則希圖獨占遠東市塲，同時更向南洋羣島，向印度，向南美開拓。於是牠們的對立衝突，就越見激劇起來了。</p>
<p>而且，這様的經濟鬭爭，貨幣戰，關稅戰，經濟聯盟等等，把一切的方法都搬出來，一面堅固自國的壁壘，一面衝破對方的堤防，一旦和平的丨不流血的丨經濟方法到了無可爲力時，就會演成武力的鬭爭。我們雖不必以爲明年後年就會發生世界大戰，可是經濟鬭爭越見激烈，我們中國受痛苦也就愈深了。</p>
<h3 id="c3">一九三六年之太平洋 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 力</p>
<p>（一）山雨欲來風滿樓之太平洋</p>
<p>四百年前西班牙大探險家麥哲綸乘帆船［桑安東尼］號周游世界，船經南美，太平洋上春風和煦，水波澄碧，狂喜之餘，不禁高歌曰··［和平之海！］</p>
<p>乃此［和平之海］，在二十世紀之今日，竟成爲列强虎視耽耽之中心地矣；此春風和煦，水波澄碧之太平洋，巳一易而令人不禁有山雨欲來風滿樓之感！　　［世界文明恒以大洋爲重心··最初以地中海爲重心，羅馬哀亡後，地中海之隆盛成爲歷史的陳跡；繼以大西洋起而代之，及今亦巳有下降之勢矣。替代大西洋者爲［太平洋時代］。太平洋時代包活全世界人類結爲一團，乃人類史上更燦爛之一頁。東洋人與西洋人以太平洋爲中心相互對峙；美國人之使命，即在雄立　此新運動雜關中向第一道戰線上邁進！一此美國前總統老羅斯福之豪語也。</p>
<p>南非總督斯　　將軍在某次　帝國議會席上亦唱言曰··［歌·美·亞三主角，今已相遇於遠東，人類史中最嚴重之一頁已　開於遠東矣。］</p>
<p>熱。太平洋爲世界最大海洋，約占全全球水面積之半，水　總面積三分之一，對此廣大之水　，能否充分利用，與人類生活之盛衰　係至鉅。環　於此大洋之國家，或爲中國，或其屬地，如英，美，日，法，蘇，中國，及印度，澳洲，南菲，南美諸國等均在其例，殆包括全世界國家半數以上。所謂太平洋問題，即在此等國家各欲如何運用此大洋之力以謀其産業，貿易，軍事，外交，移民，食糧，文化之發展所起之衝突。而能轉移並解决此問題之要角，事實上當屬英，美，日，蘇四國。</p>
<p>中國若不迎頭趕上，努力於政治上經濟上之大革新，奠定國基，以應付此新時代之狂潮，則此大洋上將臨之運命一旦到來，一切　有處於被動地位，任人宰割與驅策耳。寗非枉爲此大洋上之一國家乎！</p>
<p>（二）所謂［一九三六年］</p>
<p>一九一四至一七年之歐洲大戰後，大多數國家咸呈衰疲，若干國家雖獲得畸形發展，不知此種發展，乃由大多數國家之犧牲換來，及至犧牲無可犧牲之時，則此以他國犧牲爲基礎之國家，亦必根本動搖·兼之資本主義經濟内在的矛盾，日益尖銳，一九二九年空前的世界恐慌於焉發生，迄今將屆五載，非獨毫無好轉希望，抑且駸駸加劇；加劇；迭次國際會議，均告失敗，迄令恐怖空氣愈加</p>
<p>緊張而已。於是各國［往太平洋去！］之呼聲日高，視太平洋爲其最後之賭場，若舍太平洋已無出路者然。日本曰··日本乃太平洋主人翁，亞細亞乃亞細亞人之亞細亞，孰得喧賓而奪主？美國曰··太平洋應實行門戶開放機機均等。英國曰··誰亦不得侵害大英帝國旣得權利。蘇聯則佯若無事，噤不發言，惟昕夕加緊完成其二次五年計劃，其居心亦屬路人皆知。雖政策各有不同，而要提得太平洋覇權則一。此等絶對無調和可能之各國政策，必有激起正面衝突，拔刀相見之一日。此拔刀相見之日，一般輿論咸謂不在十年百年之長時間後，而在迫於眉睫之一九三六年最爲可能；即在短短二年後之一九三六年將爲太平洋上波濤洶湧，霾雲密佈之開始。何以故？蓋一九三六年以前，有二難關不易渡過。　　第一，去年三月二十七日日本通告退出國聯，明年該日即爲退出國聯正式發生效力之時，南洋委任統治各島，理應由國聯收回。尤其國際擁護派各小國，以及以收復失地爲主要政綱之德國希特拉政府將作强硬主張，殆無疑義。縱此等弱國之主張，日本可置諸不理，然英美二國於南洋羣島軍事上之意義到關重大，對於收回之主張必樂與贊助。設日本放棄南洋委任諸島，則英美國艦隊極易航渡太平洋，且可免澳洲，菲列賓之受威脅，不戰而使日本屈服。故日本之於南洋統治問題，非惟星羅棋布之小羣島問題，實不啻軍略上生命線之保持或被奪的問題。英美德等主張收回之要求愈切，其蠻橫拒絶亦愈厲，是對此羣島兩種相反之嚴重對立，不論其外交上之折衝爭議何如，勢必演成各傾全國實力以相抗争也。</p>
<p>第二，一九二二年在華盛頓簽訂之海軍軍縮條約，將於一九三六年十二月失其效力；一九三○年四月所訂倫敦海軍公約亦將於一九三五年舉行改訂會議。溯簽訂以上兩約時，日本屈於英美海軍勢力之强大，對五，五，三比率口是心非，時思報服；於下次改訂會議中當不甘輕易錯過，要求海軍均等之機會。　日本在日内瓦軍縮會議，即經提出要求主力艦七三％，大巡洋艦八三％比率案，後以限於國際環境，未能如願。今後必將堅持不放，然則將來會議中之紛爭，當以此爲焦點無疑也。</p>
<p>職是之故，世人咸度一九三六年爲太平洋危機發難之時。其然乎，其豈然乎？</p>
<p>（三）英美日三國海軍競爭之警報</p>
<p>一國海軍之形勢即爲其國國策之反映，欲明各國國策之動向，應對其海軍形勢一加以檢討。今日海軍之稱覇於世界者，厥爲英美日三國。茲將最近該三國海軍競爭形勢略述如下··</p>
<p>英國因一九三一年曾發生艦隊叛亂，不得不節縮海軍費，以致過去新軍艦之建造無甚進展。依倫敦公約，一九三六年爲止，英國有建造補助艦二十九萬二千噸之權利，迄今僅實行五分之二；建造中者則有十二萬噸，未興工者五萬噸，然去年十一月中旬，海軍部長蒙塞爾氏於議會中力唱促進建艦之必要，提出修改建艦計劃，於今年度興造包含九千噸級巡洋艦二艘，五千噸級巡洋艦一艘之建艦案。此雖不得謂强烈之海軍競爭，而於條約範圍内之競爭，巳充分表現矣。</p>
<p>美國向抱大艦巨砲主義，於補助艦之建造不甚經意。此衝傾向證之過去事實至爲顯明。如華盛頓會議後，美國首先着手主力艦之改裝與刷新，其七艘業巳改裝竣工，三艘尙在改裝中，此項改裝費用，約達一億六千萬金元之多。更就倫敦公約後之情况觀之，美國依條約原有興建輕巡洋艦，驅逐艦，及潛水艦共二十五萬噸（一九三六年爲止）之權利，乃至去年春爲止，僅興工建造驅逐艦八艘。一面放棄大部分之補助艦建造權，一面則注全力於八呎大巡洋艦之建造，一九三○年後巳有七艦完工，六艘正在建造中。此爲美國過去之造艦政策，然至去年初夏，羅斯福政府乃决定於産業復興費中撥出五億六千萬金元，爲三年内造成補助艦三十二艘之用，現已着手興工矣。且軍令部長史登特萊僧作非正式表示，將於今春議會中提出第二次建艦計劃案。足證最近英美二國建艦情勢，均呈活躍之象。</p>
<p>更就日本言　倫敦公約後即積極成立建艦新計劃··四億七千萬日元之補充大計劃，業經完成，即所謂［第一次補充計劃··第二次補充計劃正在着手中。日本之造艦進行，較諸英美尤爲迅速。自九一八與一二八事變後美國欲使對日外交方針發生效力，亦不得不努力充實其自身力量，當史汀生詢樸拉脫提督，海軍已有充分與否一問題時，樸拉脫答云［否］，結果遂降低對日外交强度，而亟亟致力於充實海軍工作。若日本則海軍力在條約上規定之比率，雖僅美國十之六七，而實際上經近年積補充之後，已達美國十分之九。競逐之烈，殊足驚人！</p>
<p>蓋現今三國積極競爭海軍力之補充，具有二種意義··一爲其本身之國防的意義；另一意義，即爲預備一九三五年會議中發言力量之加强。綜此二義伸言之，即不外太平洋覇權之爭奪也。日本本其過去之努力，並藉其在太平洋上優於英美之地利，若再爭得海軍均等權，則不問將來戰爭爆發與否，日本必可　英美，反是，則英美可制日本。</p>
<p>（四）海洋自由原　問題</p>
<p>際公法上所謂海洋自由原　問題，將來亦必隨海軍均等問題而發生。海洋分　海公海二種··前者猶如領土·以一定國家之獨佔及行使排他權爲原則；後者則任何國家皆無行使權力之權能。［海洋自由原則］即指公海不屬於任何一國，而係完全自由不受限制之意。極端的海洋自由論者，主張公海在戰畸平時皆完全自由，然不都國際公法學家均主張戰時之公海自由應有相當限制，即認交戰國有搜查中立國船舶，扣留戰時禁制品之權。此　學說，在過去數百年間各次戰爭旣經交戰國實行，中立國亦予默認，故已成爲定論。此處成爲問題者，非在此種公論之是否合理，而係所謂［戰時禁制品］究爲何物。</p>
<p>英國在遇去數百年間每一重要戰爭中，恒挾其强大無匹之海軍進攻敵方，且進而隨時妨寗中立國物資對敵國之供給輸送。認食料，被服等平時戰時之兩用物亦屬戰時禁制品，均在扣留没收之列。。因英國過增恒爲交戰國，故對於禁制品之解釋愈寬，愈足制敵國與中立國物資之流通。美國則反是，過去處於中立國之地位較多，往往販賣其豐富的物資於交戰國雙方，以收漁人之利。故其對於禁制品之解釋竭力縮少，務使自國物資減少受交戰國扣劉没收之機會。英美兩國問對此問題常起爭論，一八一二年終至爲此而動干戈　結果仍未得最後之解决。當美淵南北戰爭之時，兩國立塲倒置，雙方主張亦隨之一度倒置，迨歐洲大戰初期，地位與主張又復舊觀，以迄於今，美國猶爲廣義的海洋自由論（即將戰時禁制品解釋至最小限）之堅持者。如前參院外交委員渡拉氏稱··英國果不承認海洋自由原則，則美國惟有出諸建造大海軍以實力施行之一途··並聲言世界上惟美國之强大海軍乃能保障海洋自由。</p>
<p>至日本之立塲，萬一一九三六年之危機無可避免，當爲一主要交戰國無疑。故其對於海洋自由之解釋，大體似與英國相同。然就現狀論，日英間經濟上之對立甚形險惡，今日人方盛唱英日必戰論，一旦戰事果　發，英國因擁有廣大之殖民地，戰時物資無待外給，無妨維持原有主張，而日本天産貧乏，石油尤付缺如，需要中立國丨丨假定如美國等丨丨之供給孔殷，寗主張廣義的原則較爲有利。美國亦樂得效歐戰時之故智，向交戰國雙方推銷過剩物資，坐獲厚利。又假令日本與美國戰，或與蘇聯戰，情形亦復相似。美蘇二國天産豐饒，遠勝日本；矧日本亦均於日本海上行使制海海權，對駛往俄境之一切船舶施行搜查與扣留，禁制品縱作最廣義之解釋，戰器彈藥等直接軍用品仍在禁制之列。以是日本將來雖爲交戰國之一，其海洋自由主張必與美國趨於一致，而與英國主張相抗。反之，假使日本接近英方狹義的海洋自由論，則美國對於太平洋之經濟的意義，本重於軍事的意義，雖欲不與日本戰，恐因對外貿易受其阻害，終不免令美國加入日本之敵方間接引起一戰焉。</p>
<p>（五）蘇聯之軍備</p>
<p>以上所述。均關於英美日三國在太平洋上之對立。我人不問將來太平洋上之戰爭，爲東方資本主義國日本與西方資本主義國英美之戰爭，抑爲資本主義國集團與社會主義國蘇聯之戰爭，又不問戰爭之發難，是否適在一九三六年，英美日旣作積極之準備，蘇聯不能不有所警戒，殆亦意想中事。蘇聯以地理關係，海軍方面除防守的意義上時加注意外，於大洋上素鮮活動。其凖備必着眼於陸空方面，當屬無疑。最近蘇聯於陸空軍備之擴張，實亦可驚。去年增置步兵四師團，騎兵一師團，並擴充砲兵航空機之結果，平時總兵力巳有陸軍七十六師團，軍用飛機二、二○○架，戰車到一　六○○輛。</p>
<p>九一八事變以來，增遣於遠東之兵力約十一萬，飛機戰車各約三百餘架，其飛機中且有七噸載重量之超重爆擊機數十架，航空線延長至二千五百基羅米突之遙··其遠東區國境間重要地帶均施築永久障壘，放棄已久之海參威要塞亦經修復；並决定每年遣送退伍紅軍數萬於遠東區，以供臨時補充之需，乃至對國民實施防毒敎育，宣傳瓦斯戰之重要性等，均堪注目。</p>
<p>（六）尾言</p>
<p>由上可見太平洋上之主要關係國英美日蘇無不於認　［一九三六年］之嚴理性後，競相從事於軍備充實工作，我國則如何？我國猶在鼓中作夢，所謂［三年國防計劃一又安在乎，國人亦嘗想像吾浩浩黃洲將成爲巴爾幹第二乎，又嘗想像五二萬五千里之海岸綫將變爲各國艦隊橫衝之戰場乎？國人自稱酷愛和平，甚至顔諸機關之門額；和平固世界上人人用酷愛，然我未聞有武裝不充，而有昌言和平之資格者也。</p>
<p>以建設求統一的均權求共治治標莫急　清除共匪治本莫急　生　建設謹將這　句老話來</p>
<p>中華民國二十三年的新禧盻　在今年以内能將這　句老話　　起來得多少進步　　　　　　元旦</p>

<p>— 茲九</p>
<p>一·緒言</p>
<p>自從達爾文創說進化論以後，知道所謂爲萬物之靈的［人］亦不覊是從猴子進化而來，同時證明了女媧補天，手製男女原種人的傳說，完全是神話，謬說，但是亦有從前認爲神話，認爲謬說的，現在居然成爲事實，例如飛行，在希臘神話中，曾說起有人將蠟製兩翼，飛上天空的事，這自然是當時文學家的空想，但現在［飛上天］的事實，誰也不會當它是神話，簡直巳變成［人話］了，所以古昔認爲神秘的，到了數千年後的現在，巳是孩提皆知的普通事物了，那末現在認爲神秘，荒誕，不可能的事實，在十年百年後，也許可成爲事實，而且是平凡的事實。因爲人，自從叛離了他的祖先丨猴，戰勝了自然界的洪水猛獸，在地球上行所欲行，爲了要避寒署，整禮貎；有所謂衣冠文物。爲了要抵抗野獸與異族，而製武器障壘，最初的所謂衣冠武器住居，都不過取之自然，此後因人智的日漸進化，由利用自然物，進而至於人造物，這就是科學的起源。例如爲避免迷途而創造指南針，爲利於遠擊猛獸異族，而製造火藥，這些都是科學的創始。自瓦特由沸水發明了蒸汽力後，將從前全依人力馬力的任重致遠，都由蒸汽機代替了。自愛迪生發明了電燈之後，一改從前僅靠菜油煤油來採光的黑暗世界，而通都大邑，都變成電炬照耀的光明大地。人造電，不但僅能發光，又有極大的力，因此一切的發動機都用電力了，自馬可尼發明無線電以後，雖遠在千里以外，巳可互相對答，如座談於一室了。這些都是近世紀的事實，是上古未曾夢想到的，即使有之，亦不過認爲神話或空想而巳。今之視未來，猶古之視今，人類的文化史是有進無退的，雖然如大戰，厲疫，火山燥發地震等，足以毁滅人類與人類的文化，但人類總有進取的好勝心，好奇心，所以世界一天不完全毁没，人類總是向前進的，人類的文化不會向後退的，所以十年或百年後，必有驚人的發明。近來我國，雖然天災人禍，民不聊生，似乎談不到什麽科學，但是十餘年前的俄國，何嘗不是餓莩遍野，内憂外患不可終日，但他們政治一上軌道，利用科學，改良一切，現在第一次五年計劃告成，第二次五年計劃已在開始，且不但利用旣成科學，更奬勵發明。眞有［生氣勃勃，後來者居上］之槪。使素以文明先覺自居的英美，亦得刮目相看。安知十年或數十年後的中國，不會更加［生氣勃勃，後來者居上］，在這民國誕生後二十二年的歲尾，夜長夢多，偶有所得，即提筆寫這様一個夢想，亦可以說百年後現實。醉心科學的人，可當它是興奮劑看，有閒人可當無稽的神話，荒誕的夢話讀。言歸正傳，將這夢話，分成數段，拉雜紀之於下··</p>
<p>二·百年後人造生命</p>
<p>近年來科學的進步，一日千里·人力的巧奪天工，巳是至可驚異，所以不久的將來，恐怕什麽東西，都可以由人工製造了，現在認爲最神秘，最難用人工創造的，要算［人類的生命］，但人造生命丨人人製造有生命的人丨將來定有實現的一天。現在以一般的常識來判斷，以爲無生物固不難由人工製造，而要製造生物，勢有所不能。但是我們可更進一步去探求，所謂［生物］與［無生物］究竟有什麽不同？［生物］最下等的原形質，與無生物的膠質，可以說絶無何等差異。人體的原素，由化學家化騐的結果，只不過碳，氫，氧，鈣，鐵，磷等十餘種原素而已。［無生物］的所以爲［無生物］也不過此種原素集合而成的東西；所不同的，只是由基礎物質組織成的方法，互相迴異而巳。［無生物］組成簡單，［生物］則有複雜的組織。尤其是人類，有極完備的組織與構造。生物的生活丨生活現象丨不過自然現象之一，［生命旣然僅是自然現象，那末這生命，當然受自然界法則的支配。化學是探索自然界的法則的，所以只要化學進步，［生命］的問題，不難解决。因爲生命的起源，大槪是基於無機物，由這些無機物的互相化合，慢慢地變爲複雜的化合物，更由這些複雜的化合物，互相結合，才形成極複雜的生物體丨人丨。這似乎與實騐化學時，將各種原素配合，製造一複雜化合物，同一作用；所以假使能將這些形成有生命的生産體的有機物，能由人工製造，同時探得他們結合的方法，那時人造生命，决不是不可能的。現在生命化學基礎··蛋白質，脂肪，炭水化物，維他命，内分泌（Hormone註··從人體的胸腺，甲狀腺，生殖腺中分泌出來的液體，）等都能夠由工製造了，此後只要漸漸研究這些物質相互間的關係，作用，那末［人造生命］恐怕不是水中撩月的事情。一旦人造生命成功，那時人口數量旣可統　，便可免節制生育與奬勵生育等麻煩。這世界或將無所謂爭奪與屠殺，熙熙然日坐春風和氣中，而有其另外一個世界。</p>
<p>三·百年後的交通</p>
<p>（甲）海上交通··人事日煩，交通事業，亦日益猛進，由帆船而汽船，在航行的安全上，速率上，巳有了一大進步。現在世界最大的商輪，有載重五萬九千九百五十七噸，法國正將下水的大商輪［諾爾琪］號，身長一千零二十八英尺，載重七萬五千噸，所有連力裝飾等，亦在其他船隻之上，可稱世界第一的商輪，從瓦特發明蒸氣到現在，不過一百三餘年，而巳有如此急激的進步，那末此後的百年，船隻的將如何進步，巳可想像而得了。現有的輪船，吃水綫以下，均屬［流線型］，藉以減少水的抵抗，而便於前進。但船隻的上方，受空氣的抵抗，一般尙未計及，空氣的抵抗力，雖没有水力那様大，但亦有相當的阻力，所以要增加速率，船的上身，亦得改爲［流綫型］，没有現在所有船隻那様的船頭，船樓等凹凸變化，純乎像游魚一様。至於發動機方面，現在固然巳有捨了蒸汽機而用内燃機，没有烏烟繚繞的可厭，但百年後的船隻，不但不需蒸汽，恐内燃機亦成爲時代的落伍者，而且必有更巧妙的推進機械的發明，這種推進機，定可不必使用柴油，煤或煤油等的天然燃料，將更進而使用工人燃料，例如用空氣中或水中的養氣，製成液體燃料，此等燃　料的原料，眞是取之無窮，用之不竭，且隨時可在船中製造。外形旣改，内部又屬新奇，速率必倍蓰於現有船隻，要週游世界，須日無多，同時爲顧全旅客的安全與舒　適，船身必異常奇大，船内必有音樂室，劇場，電影院，游泳池，運動場，動物園，植物園，公園以及一切陸上的飲食起居等的設備，旅客的在海上，，與在陸上無所軒輊，旣無暈船與船臭之苦，且猶置身於極樂世界，來往各地。</p>
<p>現在只爲軍用的潛水艇，到那時必可爲旅行之用。在天氣晴快的時候，游行海上，陰雨風雪的時光，潛行海底，借此瀏覧海中的奇觀，侶魚蝦而游水晶宮，其樂如何，他如研究海中生物，亦可利用這潛水旅行船，採取魚，蚌，海藻。</p>
<p>（乙）陸上交通；那時的陸上交通，大半改在地下，陸上必廣關公園，與幽美的人行道，公餘之暇，或散步或休息，因爲到了那種時代，人們的工作時間，必較現在减少，游息的時間延長。地下的交通利器，當不至於再用現在的黑烟朦朦的火車，必有更輕快舒服的東西發明，至於通信機關，一定捨去郵信而用無線電直接談話，而這談話，又不僅聽其聲，且可見其面，所以雖然相隔千里之外，只要一捻機關，即可對面，談笑言歡。</p>
<p>（丙）空中交通；　現在的飛機，除出軍用外，民用的究竟不甚普遍，而且需費又大，一般人不能享受到這騰雲架霧翺翔於空間的滋味。百年以後，或無所謂貧富之分，人人得利用這交通的利器，不但可乘之豪游世界，或且可乘此而漫游另一星球，空中的交通事業，旣然十分發達，那麽空中的交通訊號，空中交通巡查等，一定是必要的，天空現在是飛烏翺翔的世界，他曰是人們的耀武場所了。且那時的飛機，必比現在的安全，更没那種振耳要聾的機聲。爲利於有團體旅行，必有大形飛機出現。且各處有飛機塲，可任意上落。</p>
<p>四·百年後的住居</p>
<p>生而爲人，衣食住行樂，不管百年或千年後，總是必要的。只是時輪進展，隨之變遷而巳，現在的住居，可說全是畸形的發展，大都市高樓頂天，大厦櫛比，而鄕邨間，矮廬茅舍，人烟稀少，百年後的住宅建築，必力矯此弊，將它平均分配，人人都得享受新鮮的空氣，人人均得承受可親的陽光。且因陸上交通的移入地下，四週可减少擾人的車輪聲與警號聲，他如娛樂機關等，也是一改現在的密閉室内的娛樂丨如跳舞廳，賭場等丨而改爲戶外游戲，且因傳眞電影（不像現在的電影，只能映在銀幕上，而在空間映出其聲音動作）的發達，在廣塲上，可以看到空中的歌舞游藝等。且那時候，人力巳能巧奪天工，氣候旣可任意調節，絶不會感到嚴寒酷暑的脅迫。</p>
<p>五·百年後的糧食</p>
<p>我國人民的好吃，是世界有名的，每日三餐，盡竭麻煩之能事，時間金錢兩不經濟，近來歐美各國，已隨處有價廉物美的公共食堂，蘇聯更有公營食堂，工作人員，可不必顧及柴食油鹽，到了一定的時間，即可到食堂中去，得到適口的飲吃，較之我們現在的各家自己料理，巳簡便多了。但百年後，因科學的進步，自然物的减少，所吃的，恐怕不盡是現在的米，麥，蔬菜，内類，而應用有機化學，製造輕便可口的合成食料，，旣無須烹飪之煩，又不需碗匙杯碟等的東西，只要將人體所需要的蛋白質，維他命，水·····配成丸藥似的食品，每餐一兩粒，即可果腹，於忙碌的人們，可謂便利之至。</p>
<p>六·百年後的衣飾</p>
<p>衣服原來的目的，在於避寒暑，整禮貎，百年後的世界，前面巳經說過，因科學的進步，旣可呼雲喚雨，氣候可由人工調節，旣無溽暑，又無嚴寒，人人都只要輕衣薄裳。周時人造絲，人造毛等，必比現有的，更加美魔，而輕柔　體。</p>
<p>七·百年後的熱源</p>
<p>人，人從脫離了茹毛飲血的時代，即鑽木取火，提倡熟食，因此燃料就漸漸地爲人類必需品，由野草木材而煤塊煤油，可說燃料的速迅進步。今日煤礦煤油礦等的發現，成爲必要的工作，但煤礦是天然物，終於一時掘盡，且分布又不均匀，所以燃料成爲特别重重問題，將來可不用天然燃料，而取太陽戀或地心熱，此爲利用熱源。</p>
<p>八·今後的科學戰鬭器</p>
<p>國際間國與國的矛直的對立，巳是日益尖銳化，什麽軍縮會議，經濟會議，都告失敗了。各國整軍造艦，造飛機，製毒瓦斯，巳成了公開的秘密。所以第二次世界大戰，不久將來臨人間，或者最近一二年内，即有爆發的可能。所以我名之曰今後的科學戰鬭器。</p>
<p>（甲）毒瓦斯··毒瓦斯是現代戰器中的最時髦的很殘酷的，巳經發明的如··僞涙瓦斯（使敵流涙，雙目不能仰視）窒息瓦斯（使敵人呼吸閉塞）糜爛性瓦斯與中毒瓦斯（將敵方士兵肌膚潰爛或中毒）等，將來或有催眠性麻醉瓦斯出現，要取敵方城市，不必攻擊，只將此瓦斯，密散敵方空間，便陷於睡眠狀態，於是占領其城市，解除其武裝，旣滑稽而又不甚殘忍。</p>
<p>（乙）細菌戰。細菌戰爲國際法上所禁用，但一旦酣戰，恐怕國際法亦等於廢紙了。所以未來的戰爭中，或有它一顯身手的好把戲。例如撒布虎列拉，黑鼠病，傷寒症等的細菌於敵方都市的上空，此等細菌附着食物，或落入河沼蓄水池中，他的結果，必厲疫驟發，失去戰鬭力而屈服。</p>
<p>（丙）怪力線··利用光線殺人，恐怕也有可能性，現在各國的科學家，正在秘密研究中，例如··超短波，高周波的音波，高壓電流無線放射，或者利用鐳的放射力X及超熱線的放射，或者利用二個不同的放射線的交叉點丨丨此交叉點有偉大的殺人力丨丨等等，這些怪力線不但能殺人，且用它來爆發火藥，失去磁力，停止發動機等，也有意想不到的效力。</p>
<p>（丁）有毒針彈；這個不像現在的子彈，或炸彈，它是是輕巧而有自動機關的武器，内藏無數的毒針，凡受着這彈的，雖僅屬皮傷，但因針端有猛毒的結晶體，不久即由昏醉狀態而致死亡。</p>
<p>（戊）飛行唐克··所謂飛行唐克，機身由　的合金製造，旣輕又堅固，身重五十噸至百噸，環地球一週只須二十四小時，或比此更快，也未可逆料。帶了怪力線，細菌彈，毒針彈，來往敵方空間，施行爆炸。</p>
<p>（己）飛行軍艦；飛行軍艦，旣可飛行，又可潛航水底，供給［無航跡電氣魚雷］的電流，敵方的超速度魚雷，因此無航跡電氣魚雷的無線電操縱，可得適當的擊中。</p>
<p>（庚）有翼魚雷··這是陸上使用的，但是和水中的魚雷一様，由無線電波的操繼，可裝置各種爆發藥，在近距離的城市中襲擊，不須任何人力。</p>
<p>九·結論</p>
<p>科學爲人類造幸福，解苦痛，所以人人希望科學的進步，眞正的成爲萬能；但不幸的是··現在的科學，變成了戰爭的御用品，它反來毒害人類，消滅人類。不過科學本身，是由人類操縱的，人類要它怎様，它就怎様。與科學無涉。前面巳經說過，第二次世界大戰或者就在目前了，這次的戰爭，是科學戰爭，也可以說不是人的力的戰爭，而是智力的戰爭。在這個未來的世界，是可怕的，也是可歡迎的，全在我們的努力如何耳。</p>

<h3 id="c5">最近日本政局之動向 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 熙</p>
<p>（一）齋　内　成立之偶然及其作用</p>
<p>去年五月十五日，犬養毅音相被刺，政友會内閣隨卽瓦解，此時爲繼任内閣問題，日本政局，完全陷入混亂狀態中，鈴木喜三郎之政友會内閣，若櫬禮次郎之民政黨内閣，平沼騏一郎之法西斯蒂内閣，或齋藤實之舉國一致之混合内閣，皆成疑問，由憲政常道之觀點言之，政友會在議會内有三○五名之絶對多數，組閣之［大命］，應降於鈴木，若以責任問題言，閣揆應屬在野黨領袖之若襯，惟當時政友會，已爲衆矢之的，一旦鈴木組織政友會内閣，勢必引燃反動之氣烙，政黨政治，益速於破産！民政黨在議會中之勢力極微，而所標榜之政策，且無政友會之澈底，皆認不足以當此［非常時］之大任，政友會及民政黨自量其力，亦不敢重蹈犬養内閣之覆轍，然則法西斯蒂，密佈於日木全土，何以不産生平沼之法西斯蒂内閣耶？祇以該黨無統一之組織與指導之重心，故無組閣之力，不然，則法西斯蒂之獨裁政權，早巳樹立於日本矣，日木法西斯蒂組織旣屬散漫，各派意見又分岐，平沼内閣卽能成立，政局必轉入混亂之漩渦，而益不可收拾！國内不能與各巳成之勢力妥洽，國際上益陷於更孤立地位，此則彼時日本朝野上下，所不能怱視者也！但日本法西斯蒂，絶不致放棄奪取政權之野心，不過認爲尙非其時而巳。故欲造成一政黨政治與法西斯蒂間之過渡政權，而舉國一致之齋藤混合内閣，乃應運而産生矣。此種政權之産生，蓋當時政友會與民政黨自覺無奪取政權之可能，而又不願政黨政治告終，故亦希望有一遇度政權之出現；藉以抑壓法西斯蒂之氣焰，齋藤内閣之成立，政民兩黨乃不惜加以贊助，而内閣中亦參加兩黨出身之閣員。</p>
<p>齋藤内閣雖於政民兩黨與法西斯蒂力贊下産生，然始終向軍部逢迎。於任内，出兵熱河，退出國聯，增加軍事預算，舉凡財政，外交·軍事·幾無不響軍部意志决定。在閣議上，齋藤與財長高橋雖常與荒木貞夫，大角岑生陸海兩長爭執；終爲軍部所屈服也。</p>
<p>齋藤内閣並無一貫之政策，僅以五一五事件後，時局混亂之機會，得登舞台，人皆認爲一過渡内閣而已。其中數起風波，而其壽命能延至今日，殊出人　　意外！其所克臻此者··亦因其本無政而能抱持一貫之遷就主義；若五一五事件後，成立一有能有爲之内閣，則其反響必大，且恐日本早已成爲法西斯蒂之天下矣！　　（二）齋藤内閣存續之原因</p>
<p>以齋藤内閣無爲無策，不死不活之政權，决無長期存續之可能性，亦非日本上下所希望之局面。但國内外一切虛懸之問題。不得不有最後之根本解决，無論軍部與國民，皆不容長此維持現狀，在此已發現兩種傾向··一則主張推翻現政權，一則對現政權欲加以部份之改造。主張推翻現政權而復歸政黨政治者爲政友會，丨丨以鈴木喜三郎總裁爲中心之强硬派，因其在國會中擁有三。五議席之勢力，頗有組閣之資格，但以五一五事件之責任問題，以及當時政友會之手腕不能收拾政局，只得暫將政權，讓與過渡性質之齋藤内閣，此非永久放棄政權之意，齋藤内閣成立以來，仍不斷期望政權之復握；加以政友會若長此離開政權，於黨内之統制甚難。犬養内閣崩潰之後，内部已形成三派，一爲鈴木爲中心之强硬派，一爲床次竹二郎爲中心之自重派。一爲久原房之助爲中心之舉國一致派。此三派之意見，日趨隔離，若不加以團結整理，恐有分裂之危險，故鈴木認爲政權之獲得，卽團結整理之機會也。</p>
<p>政友會一面因爲内部意見之分岐，一面失去國民之信任，以單獨之力量，對於齋藤内閣，亦無可如何；今春，齋藤内閣之財長高橋是清，曾與鈴木口約··［至四月二十日議會開幕後，决提出辭呈，］而鈴木以爲高橋之辭職，可使齋藤内閣崩潰，不料事後高橋竟踐未諾言，鈴木大爲失望！</p>
<p>政友會中之自重派，與强硬派主張不同，不贊成推翻現内閣，只贊成部份之改造，齋藤内閣中，政友會出身之敎長鳩山一郎，卽持此項主張者，主張將現内閣，實行［無任所大臣制］，政民兩總裁，卽以無任所大臣之資格參加，使之成爲强有力之内閣，調和各派間之衝突，共維時艱。</p>
<p>舉國一致派之久原，則謂政黨之對立，有害無利，如一政黨獲得政權之後，他黨不間事理之良否，惟力圖攻擊與破壞，使在朝政黨不能專心政治，而從事於互相間之鬥爭；如各黨能合而爲一，可以國家之利害爲依歸，黨爭之弊可除，該派對齋藤内閣，亦僅主張改造，而反對根本推翻也。</p>
<p>民政黨之於齋藤内閣，始終採取擁護態度，有政府與黨之槪，因其勢孤力弱，卽齋藤内閣之崩潰，亦無法獲得其政權，不如齋藤混合内閣之存在，尙可分得一部份之餘潤耳。</p>
<p>至於樞密院，軍部與法西斯蒂傾向濃厚之國民同盟，可謂互通聲氣，因齋藤内閣之於彼等，唯命是從，當願維持其有存續之生命。</p>
<p>（三）由無任所大臣制至國策恊定</p>
<p>軍部·元老·民政黨·及法西斯蒂傾向之各派，對内閣旣示暫時擁護之態度，政友會中之自重派，與舉國一致派，亦不主張卽予推翻，素稱倒閣急先鋒之政友會中之强硬派，鑒於本身實力之微弱，環境惡劣，終由軟化而妥恊，此齋藤内閣之命運所以得苟延殘喘也，免於倒閣危機後之第一步企圖，乃集中各黨派之意見與人材，緩和相互之衝突，增加現内閣實力；藉以應付内外瀕危之時局，惟此先成爲問題者，則爲無任所大臣制。</p>
<p>無任所大臣制，爲政友會出身之敎長鳩山取得軟化後之政友會總裁鈴木之同意，而向齋藤内閣建議者，卽主張政友會總裁鈴木與民政黨總裁若襯入閣任無任所大臣，以圖實現澈底之舉國一致内閣。當鳩山向齋藤内閣提出此項意見時，曾斷言曰··［内閣祇須將此項主張提示鈴木總裁，定可立卽入閣。］可知齋藤與鈴木間妥恊空氣之濃厚矣！但事實急速推進之結果，首有民政黨表示反對之態度，若襯總裁，亦有聲明··謂［民政黨巳在野援助内閣，現無追隨政友會急於入閣之必要！］而閣員中對此問題，亦覺意見分歧，雖有高橋·鳩山等之奔走，此議終於擱置，鈴木總裁，覩此複雜之情勢，亦表示拒絶入閣矣。</p>
<p>内閣實力加强運動，並不因無任所大臣論之擱置而挫折，隨此而有國策恊定之舉，此舉雖同出於政友會自重派之提倡，而其主要策動者，仍爲幕後操縱政權之軍部。彼鑒於國際形勢日趨緊張，日蘇日美間邦交惡化，對内則努力恊調政黨派别，拉攏財閥，以實行其所謂［舉國一致，］對外··則欲藉此運動，以確立其［國防第一主義］，試觀下列之記載，可知日木軍部之操縱一切。</p>
<p>荒木陸長所提出之國策，不僅限於軍事方面，舉凡外交，經濟，内政，財政，思想問題等，····都包括在内，企圖實現其所謂［一元政策］，主張於軍事後面，有强有力之經濟統制與强有力之外交，卽企圖全國之産業金融等完全置之於軍權之中，以遂其獨裁政策之大慾，勢力日益微弱而爲舉國上下非難之各政黨，深知目前政權，巳無恢復政黨政治之希望，惟有與軍部力求妥恊而巳。</p>
<p>齋藤向政黨開始會商國策之際，政友會曾單獨向政府提出下列五項意見··</p>
<p>（一）充實海軍軍備，確立對國聯及中，美，英，蘇，之外交方針。</p>
<p>（二）完成對滿之經濟聯盟，鞏固日本在滿政治，經濟之基礎。</p>
<p>（三）經濟産業之發展與統制。</p>
<p>（四）改革行政，廓清一切積弊。</p>
<p>（五）穩定財政基礎。</p>
<p>以上主張，不惟過於空洞，不着實際，且與軍部上項國策，毫不相背，足見其遷就軍部之精神，民政黨雖謂［財政上發現赤字爲亡國之兆，塡補赤字爲當務之急，］但該黨追隨齋藤之後，始終不變其態度；至於國民同盟，原與軍部一孔出氣，由軍部所策劃之國策恊定運動，其步調當無二致，故其首領中有中野正剛者曰··［若舉國一致，欲齋藤内閣採納吾人已宣示於内外之主張，全部採納，則全部贊同，七分採納，則七分贊同，應母庸客氣者也！］</p>
<p>（六）五相會議</p>
<p>日本處於内外經濟危機與戰爭危機雙重重壓之下，朝野上下，深知非樹立舉國一致之國策，不足以應付當前之難關，五相會議故於此必要之形勢下産生，所謂五相會議，與其謂集中各方面之意見而樹立一一致之國策，母寗謂在此會議上，討論如何實現由軍部所提出之國策，因其討論之中心，皆集中於軍部提案之上，軍部認爲最重要之中心問題，爲凖備戰爭之國防舉軍備擴充問題，而其具體之表現，在於軍事豫算上，現由陸軍部提交財政部之一九三四年之預算槪算，合計約達十三億元，其中親規要求，卽達八億元，縱令財長百方遷就於預算之編製，欲求財政與國防之調和甚難，因日本財政，千瘡百孔，而軍備又無限度擴張，大有骷髏曳大砲之槪，政黨方面曾見及之，齋藤與高橋亦見及之，故軍部與齋藤，高橋間，於過去以至會議中，有極多之衝突，皆不外財政與軍備之問題也。</p>
<p>五相會議之收穫如何？據十月二十日最後一次閉會所發表之公告··［五相會議關於外交，國防，財政之基本，巳交換袒懷之意見，結果得互相深切之諒解，作成大綱，意見完全一致。］又一九三三年十月二十一日臨時閣議上，對於五相會議决定事項，僅作如次之空洞表决··</p>
<p>（一）日本對國際關係，以世界和平爲目的，用外交手段貫澈日本之方針。　　（二）國防工作，以不受他國威脅與外侮爲凖備，並留意調和日本國力。（十月二十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>五相會議所得詳細緊要而具體之内容，全未發表，僅由政府方面，公佈上述極抽象之材料。十月二十四日，東京讀賣新聞之社論有曰［···所謂五相會議，實質上並無如何，日本複雜之政情，並不因此而有一步之進展！］又十月二十三日，大阪朝日新聞之社論有曰··［······如此結論，似無須特開多次五相會議。所謂五相會議，實際毫無結果；不過以鑿柄不相容之主張，在軍部强壓諒解之下，得一總合之意見而已！］由此觀之··日本五相會議之眞面目，都已盡情道破。第一，此次會議，是於軍部支配之下舉行，齋藤，高橋，終爲軍部所屈服，所謂國策，大體遵從軍部之意旨而决定。第二，財政與軍備並未得到調和；難關依然存在而未有具體之解决，將來日本軍部，正好行使其黷武主義，不受行動上之限制。</p>
<p>（七）政黨政治恢復歟法西斯蒂獨裁歟</p>
<p>齋藤内閣成立之時，有謂爲抑止法西斯蒂勢力之一種過度政權，若五一五政友内閣崩潰後，繼承以政黨内閣，將更激起法西斯蒂勢力之邁進，俟人心歸於安定，社會秩序恢復後，政權仍歸於政黨，日本名政論家馬塲恒吾，卽持此議者。但吾人應知之者，資本主義危機愈烈之國家，法西斯蒂運動，亦必有高度之發展，日本處於内外多事之非常時期，資本主義之機構極其危弱，適爲法西斯蒂發榮滋長之園地。現在對美對蘇戰爭之聲浪日高，國内經濟，財政之危機日深，惟有促成法西斯蒂政權之逐漸實現。代表法西斯蒂勢力之荒木，氣勢高張，視其他勢力如無物’不僅握軍事，國防之全力，其他一切設施，無不涉足其間；在此軍閥勢力高壓之下，如民政黨只能追附於齋藤内閣而苟延殘喘，久無組閣之妄想，政友會雖佔着國會中之優勢，曾有奪取政權之企圖··但以軍部之威脅利誘，如自重派，舉國一致派，竟主張維持現狀··卽强硬派之鈴木，亦放棄不妥恊之主張而獻國策於齋藤，加以政黨内部，亦染有法西斯蒂之成分，正在孕育解體之危機，日趨於没落之途徑。</p>
<p>在没落過程上之各政黨，最近亦曾一度表示最後之掙扎，由政友會與民政黨之一部份人發起政民聯合護憲運動，主倡者爲政友會中之久原房之助，島田俊雄；民政黨中之富田幸次郎，俵孫一，小橋一太。彼等以擁護行將崩潰之憲政，恢復政黨喪失之信用，以及重行實現政黨政治爲目的，但民政黨總裁若槻與幹事長松田等，認爲［此等聯合之動機，殊無大義之名分；］並認爲［現在尙非其時，提出反對。］（日本讀賣新聞十月二十六日夕刋）若槻並有聲明··［卽政民間須交換互相連擊之意見，亦須不以倒閣爲目的。］（見十月三十一日讀賣新聞）　又政友會中之一部，認此爲鳩山敎長二三幹部之獨斷，深致不滿。（見同日讀賣新聞）似此步調參差之護憲運動，何以期待其成功？恐亦不過没落前之罍花一現耳！</p>
<p>若日本所謂［非常時］有消解之一日，則日本政治或有恢復政黨政治之望；得此［非常時］之消解，遙遙無期；國内與國際間之情勢，能恢復九一八以前之局成，世人安敢置信哉。</p>
<p>至於最近十二月五日所開之内政會議，其所議範圍雖不如五相會議之廣泛，實際上爲討論農村與一般社會問題，但其結果，終不出軍部之操縱，且軍部與財閥之衝突仍甚明顯，是以會議續開而無結果。無力之齋藤内閣，在軍閥財閥，互相對立之下，繼承齋藤内閣之後者，其非軍部指導下之法西斯蒂獨裁政權乎？</p>

<p>民國二十三年元旦論文</p>
<p>敎育立國之前例</p>
<p>▲清代之敎育方針</p>
<p>禮云，建國以敎學爲先　總理分革命爲三時期，訓政卽敎育建國也。又云。秦漢而後，建國規模最足觀者，莫如清代。其中特宜注意者，卽爲敎育。清代之視中華，猶英人之視印度。故彼之建國，乃建立滿洲帝國，其建國敎育，實對滿洲人民之敎育，而對漢人之所施者，統治敎育而已矣。　總理又云。滿洲所以致亡者主要原因，實由於西洋文明之東侵。非此者，或再延長二三百年，亦未可知也。若此諸訓，吾人苟欲建立國民敎育之基礎者，斷不可一時或忘，絲毫怠慢者也。至於　總理所以重視清代以敎育建國之要點，略舉之於下。</p>
<p>第一　對滿洲人之敎育，爲清代敎育之主。蓋彼之所謂建國者，建滿洲人之國也。例之堯典，彼蓋視滿洲人爲百姓，而視漢人爲黎民。對百姓則欲其昭明，而對黎民則僅欲其各安生理毌作非爲而已。用心之不同如是也。至關於滿洲敎育之可得而言者，約有數端。</p>
<p>（一）敎育方針在於先實行而後文藝。以植綱扶倫爲本以經方致用爲要，以弧矢之利威天下，不汲汲於敷華馳藻，而文運彌隆。故事事求實際，尙朴實，重節儉，嚴紀律，以文爲體，而以武爲用。學校敎育，不分文武，國家考試亦文武並行。職司有文武之分而敎育無文武之别，此其要也。</p>
<p>（二）民爲國本，地爲民用，故以人民之組織，爲國家組織之基礎，以軍事之組織，爲人民組織之標凖。民與國爲一，兵與民爲一，而敎育卽行於其間。義務敎育之年齡，斷自十八歲，十八歲以下之靑年兒童，父母負敎育之責。從政出征，不得携帶未滿敎育年齡之兒子，以荒廢其學業。</p>
<p>（三）國家考試，自文童以至於舉人會試，皆以騎射爲甄錄試之科目。馬步弓箭不能及格者，不得應任何考試。</p>
<p>中國敎育之敗壞，以文武分途，爲一大病。國衰種弱，皆由於此。就吾人所知近數百年中之政象，與數十年所目覩之情形，非以文壓武，卽以武壓文。清末常見一品之記名提督，二品之記名總兵，爲統兵之府道作差官。而數年前，亦見馬弁掌縣知事之面，拉之見司務長。此種畸形政况，實爲危亂之結果，而同時亦爲其最大之原因。卽以民國以來人人所常道之軍民分治一語，實亦於理不通，於事不順。就行政言乎。不獨軍民之治應分。内政，外交，敎育，財政，何事不分。就政治言乎。一國之統治權爲唯一，而實行政治上之統制機關，亦爲唯一。一切政治。皆應在同一政權，同一機關同一政策統制之下。無軍民分治之理。就實際言乎。一國當内憂未已，外患急迫之軍事時期，不獨一般行政，應統制於軍權之下，而行使之，卽同法彈劾諸權，亦非統一於軍權不可。所謂軍國者，實一制度而非空論，無論國家如何尙文，若至内亂外患交迫之時，尙不能組織爲軍國者，其國必亡，宋明兩代是矣。至若國基已立，秩序已定，憂患已平，所謂功成作樂，治定定禮，任何尙武之國，至此亦應從事於文敎之奬勵，禮樂之修明，人民自由之保障，若專以好勇鬥很爲國者，雖文化至高，人民至强，終亦必爲害人者自害。十年前之德意志是矣。就理論言乎。武力之由來，出於人類向上之精力，爭存之需要。卽個人愼獨克已之功夫，以堅强之意志，排除自身不良之習慣，促成其自身奮鬥之努力，與乎保持自身身心之健全，使不爲環境所侵害轉移，皆爲尙武精神之源。技術之習練，不過一種工具而已。然人之生理心理，皆不能永遠保持此緊張之狀態也。和之以自然，樂之以歌樂文藝，節之以禮讓，陶融之以慈祥和平，養之以食衣住，皆文也。二者相調節，然後成爲圓滿之道德。否則不獨無益，而且而害矣。於是，從各種方面觀之，軍民分治之說，皆爲不可解之偏論。是蓋由於歷代重文輕武之習，與軍制破壞，軍紀墮落，軍學衰敗，造成之恐怖觀念所致耳。就中國内外環境觀察之，愈欲和平，則武敎愈爲重要。所謂武敎者，非僅如今日並及軍事敎育之形式而已也。全部敎育之根本，應加以改革。第一。敎育學術，與國家分而爲二之惡習，必須革除。第二。自由放任之思想行爲，必須糾正。第三。敎育以實用爲主，故實踐之道德，實用之知識實業之技能，應爲敎育之目的。第四。集團生活之嚴格的訓練，與共同生活的自動能力之養成，若是者，實爲眞正軍事敎育之基本。學校之方針能如是，然後施以適宜之軍事敎育，方爲有效。否則不如奬勵體育，聽其自由發展之爲愈也。至於軍事敎育上之宜注意者，其事更多，略舉其目言之。第一。軍官敎育，須注意於政治，經濟，常識之灌輸，與法律知識之培養，使其不至爲政治社會上之文盲，特異於衆人之偏見。第二。軍事學術機關，敎育機關，與一般學術敎育機關之溝通。第三。士兵敎育，應同時卽爲國民敎育，兼作成年補習敎育之用。俾得化數十百萬之士兵，爲受良好國民敎育之人，以求達良兵爲良民模範之目的。上之所論，僅其粗略。爲閱者參考計，故略舉之，若乎其詳，則當俟之别論。　　（四）保存民族固有之道德技能。視滿洲語言，文字，風俗，爲立國根本。以數十萬人加入數百兆人中，實效幾等於零，尙極力保持，不令失墜。此點事實上終歸失敗，然其建國之精神，實堪嘉尙者也。其他於宗敎於道德，無處不發揮其保存民族特質之勇氣。宗敎尊西藏，而民德不爲所同，學術宗中國而民風不爲所化。此通順康雍三代百餘年建國之大方針也。假使其民族固有之文化稍高者，中國民族，被其同化必矣。故中國文化所以能同化滿洲者，勢也，非中國文化之力，更非中國民族之力也。故總理常曰今日西洋，文化，經濟，政治，軍事，無一不强於我。中國人斷不可安於睡夢之中，自以爲有天誕不爲人同化而能同化人之力也，國人其猛省矣。</p>
<p>第二　對於漢民族及其他民族之敎育</p>
<p>中國敎育之衰敗，學校制度之墜落，其由來已久，而最大之殘破，厥爲蒙古入主中華之百年。不獨敎育衰敗而已也，民族精神，亦喪失殆盡。所謂禮樂冠裳，幾蕩然無存，明太祖起，逐胡而光華，其有功於民族之復興者，實足以超邁漢唐，趙宋不如也。然就文化言，有明一代殊無建設之可言。而以八股縛士人，以科舉代學校，以待奴囚者辱大臣，以敷衍太平者弱國本，若是諸端，皆明代政敎之最足哀者也。故民族新興之精神，由此而悶鬱不復舒展發揚。北方之敵未剪，東方之禍重至，内憂外患交乘，積衰之體，於焉潰敗至於不可收拾矣。清代對於漢民族之敎育，蓋承明之制，雖其建國之初，深知明代敎育方針之錯誤，思有以挽救之，而以諸種更大之利害所牽，終不得遂其改革之願。所以一國之建立，若非其民族自身學俉，自主政權，欲於異族統治之下，獲得良好之政治，實斷不可能者也。清之初葉，雖處此種困難情勢之下，建設規模，仍有足觀者，對於滿洲民族，力求獨立保持固有誠朴武勇之精神，不令受漢族文弱士風之影響，旣如前節之所述矣。而對於漢民族之敎育，亦不能謂其較明代爲尤劣。其最足稱道者，亦有數端，爲漢唐以後之特色。試略舉之。</p>
<p>（一）確立社會道德之基礎，以心性與行爲，合爲一致。一切敎育，皆以此爲凖繩。此卽康熙所頒之十六條上諭是也。試就其十六條之内容細考之，實將中國固有文化，組織成一最切實用之系統。寓述而不作之精神於創作之中。使受敎育者言言合乎其心，事事合乎其用。受者授者，融爲一體。社會之組織旣健全，則國家之本固，而人民之生活定矣。雍正復更將此十六條節而約之，成六條二十四字。於是宣傳更易，普及更廣。再選其中最關係於國家政治紀律之要義，定爲士訓，以約束入學之士子。而社會敎育，與政治敎育，兩者皆聯成一氣矣。就其大體論之，其社會敎育之内容，在當時之中國，實無一可議者。正大無私，光明普照與總理所垂八德之訓，以恢復固有道德智能敎國民者，用心正復相類，而用以束縛士人，使中國民族無復自立之精神者，其工具實爲作政治敎育基本之臥碑。試以之與彼所以敎滿洲士人者比，則知之矣。總理以三民主義敎國人者，其目的在於天下爲公，而彼之以臥碑縛天下士者，其目的在於天下爲私。公私之大旨所分，卽敎育之方針所别。是卽民族自立之所以爲必要者也。</p>
<p>（二）主敎之官，於學校敎育之外，應負社會敎育之責。實則太學之制，在清已屬有名無實。而各直省之鄕學所謂大學中學小學者，亦無學校。其敎宫之用，除主持課試與監督士子而外，别無敎育之可言。有之，卽社會敎育是矣。清之宣傳政治，實以敎官爲主要之宣傳員。敎官之任用，亦以宣傳之勞績爲一要件。康雍兩代之敎條，其所以能若斯之普及者，實運用敎官宣講之法認眞所致也。余之幼時，尙親見布政司衙門前之宣講臺，每日必有朝衣朝冠之敎官，作露天之宣講。此卽未得補缺之敎官之工作也。在余生長之漢州，無論城鄕，夜間必常有沿街設臺宣講者。其宣講之法則，以十六條六訓爲本於解釋條文之後，就其條文，引故事以證之。有唱有白，入情入理，當時平民所受之敎育僅此，任之者私塾之師生是也。在一般人民視宣講十六條爲一大功德。家有病人則</p>
<p>請人宣講，生理不遂則請人宣講，家無子女則請人宣講，欲種福田則請人宣講。家有聰明子弟，欲其見稱於鄕里，則使之宣講。窮儒設館，欲招致學生，則設臺宣講。宣講之普及，及政府敎條之見信，至於如此，所以總理讚美之，謂爲訓政之好模範，而諄屬我等切實注意之也。余復記憶當時廣漢人民心理，其視十六條六訓，尊信愛重，同於六經，而愛悅乃過之。獨對於訓士之臥碑也，則於無意識之中，懷可畏可怖之魔念。常聞前輩訓戒曰，汝等未成年未入學，若讀臥碑，必致不利。其理由何在不可知，然民族潛意識力之偉大，亦可見矣。</p>
<p>（三）對於開化蠻夷與保護此種弱小民族之政策，其現於敎育上者頗多。如限制考試之競爭，卽其一也。胃藉之禁，其動機與保護雲貴臺灣之夷人，有最密切之關係。以實際而論，對於此種未開化之民族，若無奬勵保護，則血族之消滅已至易，而况於文化競爭之失敗乎。至對於遠藩來學者之優待，使其人人得所，尤爲以大事小之善政。如當時琉球遣來之留學生，入國子監讀書者，每月則有津貼，四季則有衣帽。冬季之衣則狐裘帽則貂鼠。並許每生帶從者三人，亦有火食之供給。冬則每人給以羊裘，夏則給以葛衣。此實對遠人應盡之道，非獨爲政治上之作用而已也。</p>
<p>上之所述，蓋舉其特爲重要之點言之。其餘可資借鑑者，尙復不少。如各種文獻之編輯整理，與圖書之搜集印行，書院義學之奬勵，皆有足多者。假令嘉慶而後，有能繼康雍乾三代之人，則或將更有革故鼎新之建設，惜乎其至乾隆而嘆觀止耳。以銅爲鑑，可正衣冠，以古爲鑑，可知興替，况於一國之建設，必有繼承之根據。山河依然民族如故，社會風習，亦皆有所自來。則前代之典章，後代豈能漠視之乎。隨筆寫成，文字不暇修飾。然所舉諸端，無非事實，國危時艱，閱此者當不以文字之泏劣而害意耳。</p>

<p>關於此事、彭氏今晨對外交問題新聞記者發表宣言云、［有人以法德之問是否將有直接談話發爲問題者、此予所絶對不能了解者也、吾人所爲者、乃以通常外交手續、凖備通常之外交談判、若以此而非直接談話、則數星期以來、吾人所爲者究爲何事乎、或者一般人心目中所謂直接談判者、乃指驚人之外交談判乎、吾人對國聯會始終認爲國際上較爲妥善之途徑、吾人竭誠希望龐賽按照國務會議之决定、將法國意見通知德國政府之後、能折服德國、使之相信在相互安全之條件下、公平普遍裁軍之門戶仍然大開、而軍縮會議工作之能否再有起色、全繫於法德之能否合作、因此吾人聞美總統羅斯福之演說、蘇俄人民委員會主席莫洛託夫及外交委員李維諾夫二人之宣言、倍覺欣幸、最近吾人與英外相西門。捷克外長貝勒斯會晤之時、彼此均以爲國聯會必能戰勝目前之困難、現在經過之事實、證明吾人所見之不誤、例如訂立互不侵犯條約政策、吾人親自行之、並勸他國行之、歐洲受威脅之部分、卽賴此政策以組織安全保障、互不侵犯條約政策在蘇俄與其鄰國之間尤著成效、近在巴爾幹又有進展、吾人所走之途徑甚爲適當、不可改途易轍、吾所言者、乃爲一種志願、不可僅以希望視之也、前述種種、足爲吾人之鼓勵、惜羅馬尼亞總理杜嘉區噩耗傳來、令人悉悶、杜嘉與予交好、乃有凶人下此毒手、此不獨羅馬尼亞人民之痛、卽予亦爲之扼腕痛惜也、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>用石英管鋪繞地球</p>
<p>可使日光傳送無阻</p>
<p>▲波士敦訊、碧絲堡大學化學敎授薛爾佛曼氏、最近發表一奇說、謂用透明凈化之石英管環繞地球、可使來自東方之太陽光、由管中傳至西半球、使美洲得二十四小時不斷之畫明、又用此同様方法、可使亦道之熟傳至兩冰極、使零度的氣候得以轉溫、氏曾將透明凈化之石英製成一Ｓ形之管、試騐結果、顯示日光能入其甲端而出乙端並不爲管身曲折所阻碍、由此推想、若用大量石英鋪接地面、若爲東西向、可將畫的半球之日光、送至夜的半球、若爲南北向、可使極地氣候轉寒爲暖、惟此項材料造價頗貴、故不易成功、但海濱之沙、多爲石英粒構成、希望能以廣費使之凈化、然後製成石英管、則造價或可不遠過於玻璃云、（世界社）</p>

<p>太平洋一旦有事</p>
<p>日本最懼空中襲擊</p>
<p>國土褊狹不便防空</p>
<p>重要都市全憑海岸</p>
<p>建築物又易起燃燒</p>
<p>對美俄戰略處不利</p>
<p>▲世界社云、日本陸軍少將近著文論日本之空中威脅、茲節譯如次、日本國土狹小、地勢細長、防空極感不便、日本如一度將太平洋之制海權委諸敵手、則必將蒙致命的打擊、我人對美國欲進越太平洋而施以致命的打擊、此事殊不可能、又對中國、因中國國土亦極龐大、欲施以致命的空襲亦極困難、至對蘇俄、則西比利亞爲鴻土無邊人口稀薄之所在、無論如何加以爆襲、於彼固不損毫末也、反之、我國如遭受中國方面乃至海參崴方而之爆擊、則將如何、夫日本之重要都市、幾乎悉在憑臨海岸之處、且又以極易燃燒之建築物充實其問、如東京橫濱遭受空襲、則其所蒙打擊之深不言而喻、如上所述、日本之戰略位置、僅就對於美國而言、實處於不利狀態、因此在飛機日新月異之今日、彼方自必以空軍爲對付日本之主要手段也、現在美國民間航空之發達邁進、可謂世界第一、爲此一朝有事之際、在數小時以内、可以將民間航空機變成軍用、</p>
<p>阿留新羣島方面威脅</p>
<p>又美國對阿拉斯加方面之航空開拓、非常努力、此實爲美空軍由阿留新羣島取道堪察加而進襲日本之第一步、阿留新羣島方面、在以前雖案被稱爲魔之空、濃霧極多、欲編隊飛行實爲困難、然近年來航空術之進步、例如軛無綫電話之成送、依賴此種電波而從事航空、則雖在霚中及黑夜、亦可以安全飛行也、故吾人目該地島爲安全地帶之思想、實已不適用、該地帶之安全、實已成爲過去也、</p>
<h3 id="c24">南太平洋方面之威脅 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>次言南方、據最近情報、美國在大西洋設施空港、從事凖備、使民間可以自由輸送飛行、據此、由檀香山經南洋委任統治羣島出馬尼刺飛往中國大陸之航空路、早晚當可實現、現在美國之大飛機輸送公司、係由阿拉斯加縱斷美國以達中南美而輸送旅客者、『汎太平洋航空輸送公司』　係企圖橫斷太平洋以抵中國大陸之大飛行者、在去春由上海經香港以至馬尼刺之航空試騐飛行、已告完成、加面太平洋方面之航空輸送完成之塲合、則卽從該方面、美國亦將以飛機之威力進迫日本矣、</p>
<p>大飛行船主義威脅</p>
<p>最後、就美國之飛行船一爲述說、美國之大飛行船、自阿克朗號爆沈之後、雖對於飛行船之信仰暫時遭一打擊、然飛行至上主義旋卽勃興、目下正在企圖建造碩果僅存之梅庚那之姊妹船、不僅此也、美國窺伺日本不具有飛行船之弱點、及企圖以大飛行船主義活躍於將來之太平洋戰役中、夫大飛行船之威脅力、乃在其偉大之續航距離、例如以檀香山爲起點空襲日本、可以在恣意爆襲沿岸之各處之後、再從容飛回檀香山、其續航能力之大有如此、又其爆彈裝載力、加以人計算、可裝載二百人以上、今試以二百人改爲炸彈、則其炸彈之多可以想見、尤其大飛行船之特長、祇需不遭變災暴風、則對於廣漠之海洋、有一氣翔破之能力、此可於數年前徐柏林號之太平洋橫斷一舉得到證明、</p>
<p>原來飛行船之爲物、其目的雖在以遠大之續航力從事太平洋之搜索、然迄於近頃、則其目的已漸進至偵察主義、更進而至爆擊主義、在氣候良好及畫問飛行船雖因速力之遲緩、吾人或可以戰鬥機擊沈之、然在夜間及在天候惡劣之時、則正飛行船發揮其威力之獨擅勝塲之時也、故對於美國之飛行船、日本實不啻暴露於可恐的威脅之下、</p>
<h3 id="c25">中國方面之威脅 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>上述東太平洋之情形、今試一轉眼而考察中國、中國自中日事變發生以來、飽嘗日本空軍所給予之苦經騐、空軍建設之思想、澎拜於官民上下之間、目下對於民間航空之助長、空軍之建設、飛行師之養成等、均刻意從事、企圖於一九三六年造成空軍一千五百機、此種計劃、在與美國緊緊握手之下、由美國之空軍力加以完成、據傳說、在一九三三年之春、已有數十架戰鬥機到達南京、此後尙將陸續輸送、杭州之飛行學校在美國將校指導之下、不僅亟亟於中國駕駛員之養成、且據風傳、在中美航空密約之下、以空襲日本爲目的、中國在揚子江沿岸海州（靑島與上海間）溫州（浙江省之南部沿岸　等地、計劃設置飛行根據地、在萬一之塲合將此等根據地借與美國云云、此說曾使日本一時爲之震駭者、從上海至九州約九百基羅米突、以溫州杭州海州爲根據地、用美國空軍之進步之遠距離爆擊機對日空襲、則作爲日本戰時工業地帶之北九州地方·佐世保軍港·及位置朝鮮南部之鎭海灣·長崎·關門海峽等戰略要點、悉將慘遭爆擊、尤其根據某種情報、中國之空軍擬計劃多造水上機、此其目的、仍不外乎欲自由飛行於東海而空襲日本耳、目下中國之空軍大約在三四百架左右、然在蔣介石氏執政之下、一切設施悉向國力之回復、軍備之充實、尤其空軍之建設之企圖邁進、吾人對之、實不容有所蔑視、吾人實不得不凛然戒懼而預存萬一之想也、最後對中國方面有不能不一言者、則廣東軍政府是、廣東軍政府與美國之統治地菲列濱羣島相距極近、有密切關係、從而美國對於廣東軍政府亦非常賣力、目下廣東軍政府之空軍指導者中、有美國之將校以下之十數名參加其間、充廣東軍政府空軍建設之任、以一九三六年爲目標、彼等擬完成飛機約三百架、由此而觀、菲列濱與廣東軍在某種塲合之下、其將有機的活動而對抗日本無疑、尤其在日美戰爭發生之時、此種情形將露骨現出無疑、於此、吾人對中國之陸軍雖不足深畏、然對彼之空軍、實不能不感到一種預想以外之威脅、</p>

<p>滿　以來、　聯在北滿方面陸續增加軍隊、堅固防禦、而其最致力者則爲空軍、該國空軍僅就目下派遺到遠東方面者計三百架至四百架、根據地雖散在各處、然其主力則爲沿海州这海參崴·尼古里斯克。及斯派斯克等地、在海參崴附近、據稱有七噸容量之超重爆擊機三十乃至四十架、且其航行距離有二千五百基羅之優、自海參崴至東京約一千二百基羅、至敦賀約九百基羅、至新瀉約八百三十基羅、如戰端一開、則彼等大學襲來肆行擲炸之後、仍可悠然引回、蘇聯空軍司令官曾有如次之言、</p>
<p>［日本如欲爆擊海參崴、則儘其爆擊可也、而我則亦立刻以爆擊機爆擊東京橫濱、在此塲合、誰受致命的損失、蓋不言可知］、</p>
<p>由實際戰略而觀、此言誠然、蓋日本將受致命傷、而蘇聯則並不感到深切之痛癢也、尤其蘇聯之空軍司令官、實爲精悍無比之人、素以勇敢使用空知名者、從歐俄飛至速東、不出數日卽可抵達、目下蘇聯空軍勢力約二萬五千機（一九三三年）、如不幸日俄開戰、假定俄方以其中之三分之二前來對付、則達約一萬六千機、卽以半數前來對付、亦達一萬二千二百架、且其中具有優秀之起重爆擊機耶、由上而觀、在一九三五年乃至三六年時帝國之空、將受四面襲來之威脅、吾人當如何在以空守空之原則下、從事攻勢的空之凖備、以根絶此威脅乎、</p>

<p>富萊氏在國聯之演說</p>
<p>斥日本違反國際道義</p>
<p>此次國聯雅片顧問委員會、在日内瓦開會時、美國代表富萊氏、對於日本在中國東三省施行之雅片專賣政策、力事枰擊、謂爲破壞國際共同管理麻醉毒品之條約、查日本此種違反國際道義之行爲、影響我國及國際之剷除毒害工作、至深且鉅、茲特將富萊氏親筆修正之演詞全文、譯述如下、</p>
<p>［美國觀察遠東地方、（特别是中國之東三省）最近麻醉毒品發展之情况、甚爲驚異、故本席借此機會提出與之有關係者數點、喚起委員會之注意、並請委員會對於此種發展、應詳加考慮、而予以完全公佈、因委員會所負之職責、卽爲監督實行關於雅片及麻醉毒品之現行條約者也、目下此種工作、尤爲重要、因此問題内、似含有規避現存條約之狡詐行爲、且將破壞現在國際管理麻醉藥品之工作、</p>
<p>本席首願說明者、爲現在滿洲與熱河所施行違返中國法律之雅片專賣制度、此種制度之施行如稱之爲歷來非法經營麻醉毒品中惟一最大之行爲、並無不合、同時本席亦願提及最近以設計規避現存麻醉毒品之條約、而帮助此種事業之企圖、</p>
<p>關於此項設施之性質、吾人應就事實加以觀察、</p>
<p>按上文所述之雅雅片專賣制度、其設立之目的、卽爲擴充雅片之吸食、吾人如細繹其所頒布之各種章則、卽足以明瞭、此外尙有多種情况、亦均能證明此種目的、惟以施行雅片專賣制度所預想之利益、作爲借欵抵押一端、尙無相當佐證、假如有人借欵而以某種指定利益作爲担保時、則彼等卽有使該項利益隨時盡量曾大之義務、此項理論、巳於滿洲實行矣、滿洲當局、爲推廣其雅片營業、晚利用最新式之廣告術、卽彼等於當地人民通用之貨幣上、鼓籌美麗罌粟花樣、似此將使雅片之觀念、永遠保留於人民心理中也吾人亦須注意施行雅片專賣制度中所含之經濟問題、現如就滿洲所定一九三四年六月三十日截止之預算、加以考察、則對於本席所述滿洲施行之雅片專賣、卽可得有相當之觀念、該項預算中、估計施行雅片專賣所得之利益爲九八·二八二·四六元、其前一年席所得之利益、爲五·○○○·○○○元、至於施行雅片專賣之全部營業數目、估計爲三二·八九三·三九四元、其中一七·八五一·八八五元、爲雅片估計價値、止列數字、均非小數、然據可靠方面之意見、則以此數之估計、尙屬甚低、而非過高者、</p>
<p>吾人考察滿洲與熱河公賣雅片之新形式、則雅片之來源問題、自當加以考慮、依彼等所計劃之來源、其一、卽與波斯通雅片貿易、此項建議、巳於上屆雅片顧問委員會終了時、送達於各委員、此外尙有一種來源、卽鼓勵滿洲熱河等地、廣行種植是也、</p>
<p>關於發展波斯雅片輸入滿洲一項、請諸君參考上屆委員會議終了時所分送之文件、該項文件中、明白記載、有某歐洲公司因羨雅片貿易之利益、願參加於東三省之波斯雅片貿易、惟要求限制由波斯灣開往滿洲之運烟船隻、不必限制直達牛莊、不得在中途各港停留、想諸君亦當能回憶委員會主席之答復、甚爲得體、復函中聲稱、其所提議問題之處置、非本委員會權力範圍所及者也、蓋本委員會之職責、旣爲監督關於雅片與麻醉毒品各項條約之執行、則决不能更易其立塲而反助人規避條約之責任、但上述其歐洲公司之要求、顯有規避條約責任之企圖而焉、不僅此也、當國聯大會附設之顧問委員會討論中日衝突時、曾以另一種方法、提出規避條約之企圖、其提議要求承認現在以武力佔領下臨時滿洲當局所發之雅片及麻醉品入品憑照、本席聞此項計劃、卽於討論中日衝突問題之顧問委員會中提出、按此計劃、滿洲當局所發之憑照、准許雅片輸入中國之東三省、應視如一正式政府所發之憑照、其所持之理論、完全根據一九二五年日内瓦公約、而忽略一九一二年各種禁烟條約基礎之海牙公約、卽一九二五年之日内瓦禁烟恊定、亦未能注意及之、而此項恊定、實爲參與海牙公約各國、計議如何施行該項公約之規定者也、至於討論中日衝突之顧問委員會、亦未能從海牙公約之關係、討論該項提議、</p>
<p>以下爲該顧問委員會建議之一、依照一九二五年日内瓦禁烟公約、國聯會員國及有關之非會員國、對於將鴉片或其他毒品運入所謂［滿洲國］地方之請求、除請求人持有合於上述公約之入口憑照、聲明此項物品運入滿洲地方、非充違反上項公約所規定之用途、且經受請求政府之同意時、不得予以許可、發貨時、應隨帶出口憑照一紙、此後出售鴉片之政府、不得再送第二紙出品憑照與［滿洲國］、否則此種行爲、卽將視爲與事實上承認滿洲國無異、</p>
<p>美國政府質問上述建議、是否與關於管理麻醉藥品之基礎國際公約（卽一九一二年海牙公約）相符合、查美國與國聯其他數會員國、均曾加入海牙公約、上述建議、實與海牙公約不符、在各國對中國於東三省之主權承認時期、則此項提議將生鴉片運入中國禁止鴉片入口之東三省、卽爲違反海牙公約第三條與第十五條、依該公約第三條、締約各國應設法阻止生鴉片運入禁止入口之國家、同約第十五條之規定、凡與中國有條約關係之各國、應恊同中國政府採取相當辦法阻止鴉片與毒品私販於中國領土之内、</p>
<p>此外准波斯鴉片輸入滿洲、亦不過增加吸食而已、且此種行動、無論如何、乃違反海牙公約第六條者也、</p>
<p>查於遠東殖民地施行公賣之各國、爲嚴格遵守海牙公約之責任起見、曾於日内瓦禁烟恊定第六條中、作如下之規定、［除將輸入國政府所發給保證輸入藥品不致作爲非法用途之入品憑照、交出領土政府查騐、並認爲可以接受外、該項生鴉片之經由某一領土、運至該領土以外之另一目的地、亦須列入禁止之例、］該項恊定之規定、卽爲防止波斯鴉片貿易、而討論中日衝突之顧問委員會所擬定之計劃、有規避國際條約之義者、吾人將何以證其爲適當、</p>
<p>吾人應坦白無私、並須注重事實、欲便利運入波斯鴉片於滿洲之動機、究竟爲何、諸君、此乃一舊故事、其目的爲貪望、爲謀利、與從事其他非法貿易之動機無異、余並未思及本顧問委員會各會員、曾愼重考慮某公司之請求函件、（該件附入通知第一四九五號）或對於不能供給其需要之滿洲烟民表武惶惑、因有熱河在其附近、歐洲各公司之願從事於波斯與牛莊間之鴉片運輸、其目的已顯明、爲謀利而已、</p>
<p>茲按此種辦法之結果言之、接受滿洲及熱河當局所發之憑照、卽爲便利波斯及土耳其鴉片輸入中國東三省、該省所産鴉片含嗎啡量較少、該省在今日武力佔領下、所頒布之各項法規及條例、不僅與中國固有法律相反、其管理方法、極不適宜、非法販運、亦有增無巳、故輸入波斯鴉片於滿洲、係利用滿洲以爲國際私販之基礎、此乃必然之趨勢、</p>
<p>任何便利波斯鴉片輸入滿洲之設施、卽足以加增該地之是項鴉片以供吸食及製造嗎啡與海洛因之用、由是滿洲必成爲私販中心而有威脅他國之可能、此種情况所發生之問題、大有應爲鴉片顧問委員會及中央鴉片常務委員會注意之必要、</p>
<p>堆積含巨量嗎啡之鴉片於滿洲、卽足爲美國之威脅、違反關於鴉片及麻醉品條約之規定、而不顧將來必定發生之危險結果、故余對於討論中日糾紛之顧問委員會關於［滿洲國］入口憑照之　　、有違反一九一二年海牙禁烟公約之義務不得不提出抗議、至關於開拓本地供給之來源、據報告所得、熱河當局、本年對於鴉片之栽種及收割、較之往年、更爲努力、前在中國管理下、每畝徵稅十元、本年則每畝僅收五元、且發行各種宣傳文字、鼓勵人民種烟、甚至派用飛機散發傳單、以資普遍、聞此種辦法、巳具成效、滿洲栽種鴉片之推廣、亦大有可觀云、</p>
<p>此種增加栽種及開拓私販鴉片之結果、在滿洲及熱河、巳産生多數之新烟民、聞因産量驟增、供過於求、毒禂大有蔓延中國全境及其他各國之勢、</p>
<p>余甚望本委員會注意此種威脅之嚴重、並望以對土耳其東歐及華南各地情勢之努力者、同様對付滿洲及熱河、］</p>

<p>歸途瑣聞</p>
<p>由立煌返六安候車、復留一宵、趨訪前所認識之友朋、爲告駭聞三項、前信未及記載、茲補叙如次、</p>
<p>（一）高利貸　六安頻年兵災、繼以災祲、財盡民窮、已達極點、各鄕富有資産者、昧於互助之義、每當窮民借貸、無不重利盤剥、有所謂［買棧稻］者、借洋一元、勒令賣稻七斗、一俟新榖登塲、卽行索取、更有借種二斗、索回一石、借米七升半、索回四斗五升者、利高類繁、人地各殊、木廠埠糧行林立、約有二十餘戶、厚利收放糧食、刁風日甚一日、以本年論、聚盛和放欵六千元、距新糧下地、爲期僅兩月、每元卽須付利五角、收錢收糧、臨時决定、馬同和貸放三千元、文玉隆亦貸二千元、餘各數百元不等、槪以八升借出、勒還一斗四升、爲期至多不過五六月、而利率之高、竟一至於此、貧人胼手胝足、終歲辛勤、甚至盡其所獲、不足以償所負、嗣經縣長查獲、特定借利四條、（一）凡在二十二年度内、借貸他人之現金米、榖者、應照下列各條規定辦理、（二）借貸現金者、限本年内歸還清楚、其利率每月每元、槪以一分六厘計算、（三）借貸稻米者、應按借貸時稻米之價、折合銀元、其歸還日期及利率、均照前條辦理、（四）借貸時所立之字様及抵押品、應邀同保人、無條件退還、此佈告係於八月貼出、債權人固多陽奉陰違、仍照原約收受、而債務人深恐得罪債主、致塞來年告貸之門、自願照舊繳納爲數亦屬不少、</p>
<p>（二）裁白役　六安縣故府治、司法警察、多至九十餘名、每名又復雇用［伙紀］數名、頂替服務、數達四五百、平日槪無餉糈、人皆稱曰［白役］、此項白役、身家生活、均唯一票到手、盡量需索是恃、有謂［城中不如鄕下好索、民事不如刑事多得］、鄕人不幸發生刑事案件、往往傾家蕩産、身敗名裂、卽以若輩傳票人（卽白役）誅求苛索所致、秦兼縣長、下車伊始、洞燭此情、立將此項白役、選留三十名、給薪服務、餘皆盡行裁去、爲數四百餘名、遠近聞之、無不稱快、</p>
<p>（三）考敎員　全縣公私立學校、不下百數十餘所、敎費區各爲政、多被挪用呑没、致校門懸有招牌、内則毫無聲息、甚至招牌亦無之、查學者僅知其校名、究不知其校址、内容則有名高小、而僅辦初級一班者、有高初各有一班、中問不能銜接者、有校舍校具、一應俱全、並已委有校長、照領經費、叩其學生人數、則云尙未招獲者、後經秦兼縣長、一一查實其事、因有［考敎員］之舉、所得成績、確係太差、據縣府呈敎廳［整頓敎育］文内所截、［有自稱担任史地敎員、而不知著史者爲何人、詢以皖南與何省毘連、更茫然無以應、甚有謂平漢鐵路、經過安徽境内、廣東有廣港鐵路者］、皆爲此次［考敎員］趣聞之一斑、</p>
<p>歸時、車經合、肥有一小學敎員、欲往安慶、搭車同行、談次、知該地素爲産米區、富庶冠於淮安、土地尤稱集中、全縣阡陌相連、幾全爲三五大地主所擁有、近年因受時勢影響、各地主不但不收買田地、甚且將原有田地、分析變賣、投資武漢京滬各大都市、仍多爲地皮生意之經營、現有地最多之段姓一家、亦不過千畝左右、又談該縣敎育經費、年收約六萬元、支出爲五萬九千七百餘、兩抵尙餘一二百元、	敎師待遇甚薄、高小每小時二角五分、初小祇二角、且不得多任鐘點、城内辦有省立六中及女中、規模較大、學生衆多、待遇自亦較優云云、</p>

<p>嗣搭下行開滬之江輪、每到一埠、搭客下船者甚少、而上船者頗多、上船人中、以形似難民之分子、尤占絶對多數、彼等皆購統艙票、惟無錢再向茶房買床位、槪被逐於艙外舷邊之過道上、或船怅餘地上、各就行李、偎依蹲臥、倘遇暴風雨·或巨浪濺水於輪上、均無法以避之、白飯兩餐、雖云輪上供給、但早必過午、晚必入夜、人皆飢腸轆轆、一見飯籃抬至、無不蜂擁上前、爭搶而食、無菜亦無湯、惟有高呼、飲茶者、驟聞趨前、則云每杯銅元二枚、摸袋不名一文者、頳然告退、頗不乏人、飯不够食、誰請添辦、卽被辱駡、及收票時、每人須付銅元四、枚（按此係小錢、若購床位或買房艙票、則付數元不等、）嘗見有一婦人、被逼不過、向人借付曰、［倒頭費、來拿去、］茶房竟批其頰、憤憤而去、此輩形似難民之搭客、嘗與過談數人、目的地均在京滬（實際俟到南京下關、下者甚少、上者反多、）不云［探親訪友、］則曰［謀事做工、］婦人亦率爾對曰、［去當佣人、］聞其聲、不禁迴想此行所見農村崩潰之慘象、爲之唏噓不已、</p>
<p>官艙房艙中、則麻將聲與吸烟聲、一剛一柔、互相應和、直抵滬濱而始息、尙有一討厭事、似爲輪靠各埠時所獨有、一般小販、呌賣當地特産、如云［蕪湖大蟹、］［南京板鵬、］本不足怪、惟有一種賣書商、衣履整潔、頗與書業高尙相稱、每每破扇入艙、紛紛譏陳［性史］［情慾魔術］［女性浪漫史］一類之淫書及淫照、婉言勸買、叱其無狀、去而復來、又拱獻［曾文正公家書、］［顔氏家訓、］以及［太上感應篇］等等、笑容可掬、再四央請、至少選購其一、遇之者眞有哭笑不得之感、此時雇客偶移照料已物之注意力、隨身要物、立可不翼而飛、俗喻輪上爲租界、以今證之、信不我欺、</p>
<p>記者此次視察贛皖湘鄂、旁及豫南漢川經扶、需時五閱月、遍歷五十餘縣、多爲收復赤區及交界地、途中雖經險阻、差幸安全返滬、各地見聞所及、都已盡量披露、惟間因道阻郵誤、未獲寄到、或爲旅次命筆、時空限制、言未能盡、亦未盡意者、容嘗蒐集整理、另刮小册、以爲關心四省實况者、作一較有系統之報告、想爲讀者所歡迎也、（完）</p>

<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>全國醫師聯合會成立自今，已屆五載。茲以元旦之良辰，開第三屆全國代表大會於首都。猗歟盛哉！極一時之壯觀矣。本　亦於元旦特刋之中，出一紀念此盛極一時之大會，而徵文於醫界同仁，鄙人不敏，聊就管見所多，略書數事，以爲大會祝，并爲大會勗焉！</p>
<p>無論團體與個人，皆須有其固定之工作，办春無固定之工作，則其生活無興趣，團體無固定之工作，則其存在無價値。放必明定工作之範圍，而後始知應負之責任，應盡之義務；應赴之目標，應有之成績，成績旣昭，而後始不得謂之徒然之生存，蘇俄自革命以後，卽努力於建設，并明定五年計劃，爲其政府人民共同工作之範圍。今者計劃成功，遂巍然恢復其歐戰前之地位矣！執此以言，寗非明證？吾國近數年來，政治之狀况，社會之情形，皆同趨於紛亂。卽以議會言之，無論其爲政治，爲學術，爲職業，，爲各種社會事業之團體，林立國内，有更僕更數之勢。而究其議會之原因，或由於安插閒散之人員，成由於樹立私人之羽翼，故有同一性質之團體，而議會若干者，宗旨如此，更何方乎其工作之範圍，又更何言乎其辦事之成績耶？夫會無虛設，而後責有專承，工作有範圍，而後辦事有興趣。本會之成立，一般人土之所欲亟知者，厥爲本會之工作。詳考本會之性質，爲全國醫界最高之機關，葦兼有學術團體與職業團體二者之性質也。夫旣曰全國，則自與各地之醫團有殊。然則本會之工作，將若何而定之乎？一言發之··各地醫團之所不能勝任之事業，本會當疾起而爲之也。至於各地所能辦者，則無須乎本會爲之。如此則本會之立場，台足以昭示於大衆，而本會之價値，始足以存在於無窮。年來本會之工作，除發行醫事彙刋外，幾無他事，醫事彙刋之性質，有以異於其他之醫刋否耶？醫事彙刋之工作，果足以代表全國醫界之成績否耶？有識者當能知之。故明定工作之範圍，以求必有之成績，則本會不爲虛設，而庶幾於社會於醫界兩有所裨益也。此其一。</p>
<p>會之多，莫多於今日之中國，吾前已言之矣！至於所謂會者，或會而不議，或議而不决，成决而不行，或行而不力。會而不議，何必會耶？議而不行，何必議耶？行而不力，何必行耶是夫會曰例會，案曰例案，則其視爲無足重輕可知。本會成立以後，亦嘗有數次之大會矣！全國會員之提案。盈尺屢凡，不可謂不多矣！但究其成績，果何在乎吾其望本屆蒞會諸公，勿存潦草塞責之心。須知之輩此來，固抱有甚大之供獻與希望。提案之目的，以能實行爲標凖，陳義不必過高，建議不必過夥，苟非本會之所能勝任者，雖臚列多端，亦祇爲空言，而無裨實際。至於開會之際，於所提之議案，尤當以能實行者爲議决之標凖。其非本會之所能實行，雖言美意深，亦當在割愛之列。故議則必行，行則必力。雖不能每案皆然，而分别其緩急以次第行之，則固不易之步驟也。抑尤有進者，數載以來，醫界同人，每有建議，往往電呈政府，委責於中央及各地之行政機關。夫政治之未上軌道，夫人知之，政府之人力財力，决無過問此種建議之餘地，亦夫人知之。於是言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，畫餅充飢，於事無濟，吾甚望本屆之大會與會諸公，宜力除此習，與其空文往返，委之於他人，不若實事求是，反之於自己。不悉成　之不速，而悉本身之不爲。蓋凡大會之所議决者，皆吾輩醫界本身之當爲者也。此其二。</p>
<p>吾所希望與大會者，如是而己！夫然後本會不爲處議，大會不爲虛開，而吾輩之蒞臨者，亦庶幾不虛此行也。</p>

<p>主張醫育敎育的諸君啊！我們要認識我們貴中國是一個貧弱的國家。我們所辦的醫育。是跳不出貧弱國家的範圍。弱是和敎育没有大影響。貧這一個字是和敎育的事業。有密切的關係。諸君對於醫育的主張。到處應該放一個貧字在腦子裏面。再從貧的裏面設法發展。那末我們貴中國的醫育。就有希望了。就可以得到平均度的整個繼長增高了。　如　究衛生。我也曉得高堂大厦是好的。日光充足是好的。冬天熱水汀。夏天冷氣室是好的。門窗裝起鐵絲紗布防止蠅蚊是好的。但是大多數是辦不到。大多數還住在草棚和湫隘囂塵的房子裏面。憑少數有力量的人唱高調。是不合理的。是殘忍的。對於我們貴中國的整個衛生狀况。是没有好影響。應該怎麽使得草棚改善。怎麽使得湫隘囂塵的房室改善。使得大多數民衆。漸漸兒增高衣食住行的衛生狀態。這種衛生學家。方才是明白自己獨家的地位。自己個人是生在我們貴中國的命運。和自己自處在貧乏環境的立場。對於衛生發展是計算整個的發達。不是計算局部畸形的發達。那末對於我們貴中國整個的衛生狀况。是有好影響的。現在各處衛生當局。差不多都感到經濟窮乏。發展困難。只好打算用最低限度的經濟。盡力擴張工作。在這個狀况之下。我把他呌做［刻苦衛生］。實在依照我們貴中國的狀况。非用這個［刻苦衛生］的方法。對於衛生事業是没有意義的。</p>
<p>敎育也是這様。前年敎育當局。知道我國的敎育。文法商三種學校太多了。和别種理工農醫平均比較起來。成了畸形的發達狀態。於是乎設法限制文法商科。一方面奬勵理工農醫的實科學校。但是文法商科學校發達的原因。就是經濟問題容易對付的關係。理工農醫落後的原因。也就是牽　相當的設備經濟問題。難以應付的關係。所以提倡實科學校當前的重大問題。也就是經濟問題。</p>
<p>另的學校我不講。我單講我們本行的醫學校。要辦醫學校。當然應該有相當的設備。做醫學校敎授的人。當然要有相當的資格。我現在先把敎授的資格討論一下。然後再講到設備。</p>
<p>（二）師賣問題</p>
<p>現在一班唱高調的得意派。都說［師資師資一。至於怎様可以夠得上師資。怎様是配不上師資。這個悶葫蘆。却在他們的肚子裏。好像一種秘方。從來没有告訴别人。但是要决定我國醫校師資的格式。廳該集合全國現在辦理醫校的人。再招幾個留心醫育的人們。開幾次會議。商量一個［斟酌全國狀况，　合現今施行的程度。］并且測量地方經濟的情形。布告全國。敎他們在最短期間。設法滿足這個資格條件。這方才是開誠布公的辦法。若是悶葫蘆藏在肚子裏。一輩子不告訴人。只口裏喊呐［師資］兩字。拿口號來做少數人爭勝的工具。敎别人無所措手足。無所適從。這種辦法。恐怕不合理罷？</p>
<p>實際上講起來。醫校敎授。尤其大學院的敎授。是應該用靑年新進。有研究的能力。肯不研究的工作。精力富足。熱心指導的人。這種敎授。才算是上乘。老成練達的人。還在其次的地位。諸君要曉得。醫學上研究成績。其很有價値可以驚人的事業。都是五十歲以下的學者所做的。嚴格的講一句。都是四十歲左右的學者。都是具有上文所說資格的學者。過了五十歲的人。久了老境。思想遲鈍起來了。精力衰頽起來了。冒險的性質犧牲的精神都退步起來了。對於學術的進取是不中用了。所以在各文明國醫科大學畢業以後。并且下過幾年研究工夫的人們。都夠得上師資］兩個字。這種人物。不限定喊呐［師資］口號一派獨有。在野的不論那一派也很多哩。</p>
<p>爲什麽醫校的敎授。要把研究當做重心呢。因爲大學院等的學生。他的入學資格很高。自身已經有了相當的考求學術能力。只要他肯用功。肯看書。那點了解力是巳經有的了。所以不很要依賴敎授的講義。不是像小學校的敎員。一句講不清楚。學童就一句不　。一句說不明白。學童就一字不懂。這才要單靠敎員講授的力量來啓發蒙童的。若是大學和醫校的學生。是要用敎授做表率。養成學生研究的觀念。提高學生對於</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>學術的犧牲心。是第一件要事。若是專在口講指劃上做工夫。不是對待受過高等敎育以上學生的辦法。這種敎授。就不免落了第二乘了。</p>
<p>但是敎授有了師資。不一定能夠發展他的敎室。因爲學校裏面如果没有充分經濟聘定固定敎授。那末這個敎授。單靠着學校薪水。自己的生活就解决不了。勢必至於旁任兼職。或在外面掛牌做醫師。對於研究。對於指導。就生出許多障礙。不能夠盡力展開了。這是完全經濟問題。和［師資］没有關係。主張醫學敎育的諸君。若是有力量。應該設法帮助。增加他的預算。使他們請得固定敎授。自然而然。師資問題也就容易解决了。若是一定要嫡派的人去幹。方才高興帮忙。這就是人的問題。派别的爭闢。我以爲對於醫育的前途。是很危險的。假如今明張三得勢。換了一批張三的人。明朝李四得勢。換了一批李四的人。一朝天子一朝臣。誰肯在個中努力呢。</p>
<p>總而言之。只要有相當的經濟。那［師資］是不成問題的啊。</p>
<h3 id="c80">吾所希望於全國醫師聯合會者 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>新年元旦，聚全國三千醫師之代表於首都。千里揆隔，相晤一室，數年神交，促膝傾談，其樂何如，雖然，以吾四萬萬人民之衆，二萬萬土地地之廣，全國醫師僅有此數，且此少數之醫師中，又復派别紛呈，團體渙散，竣視者有之，排擠者有之，加以人民知識之幼稚，社會經濟之恐慌。對此茫茫之前途，尙告吾人有不少之荆棘在焉，茲當大會之日，願略述吾個人之希望。</p>
<p>（一）宜打破派别也　新醫以科學爲基礎，以學術爲前題，實無權利之可爭，宜無派别之發生，然而某派上台則某醫校被停閉矣，某機關轉移矣，某某被停職矣，亦儼如軍閥之占地盤，此種派别之存在，對内足以减學術研究之進程，對外足以遺國際觀感之羞，今茲大會代表，有留學於歐美者，有留學於東瀛者，有就學於本國醫校者，融融泄泄，毫無瓜蒂，乃一最純粹之團體，各代表回府以後，願仍秉此合作之精神，力謀派别之打破。（鄙人曾有分科學會足以打破派别一文，登之醫事公論六期中）此鄙人之所希望者一也。</p>
<p>（二）宜互相提携也　醫師不過爲人治疾病者耳，非眞能生死人而白骨肉者也，其不能在在得病人之滿意，亦事理使然，（鄙人曾有醫師的能力和滿意的醫術一文登之本刋第五十期中）　諒吾問道亦知之深矣，雖然近年以來，往往有醫師與病家涉訟之事，宣之報端，推究其原，難免有同道之暗助，何則，蓋病家因對醫師醫術之不滿，在感情容易衝　者，雖不免有憤怨之口吻，苟其相職之醫師，能爲之解說譬喻，則聞者亦心平氣和，必不願再事紛擾，倘不幸遇幸災樂禍之醫師，不明當時之醫治情形，推波助瀾，則病家因内行之醫師，尙如此說，遂以爲曲果在彼，興問罪之師，叩律師之門，與醫師見相於法庭矣，此不但傷同道之和氣，實墮醫師之尊嚴，其結果病　家亦未必感惠，感反而叢怨其身，夫同行嫉忌之風，非吾高尙之新醫所宜有，一言解紛，一言傷邦，尙祈吾同道中互相勗勉，此鄙人之所希望者二也。</p>
<p>（三）宜努力於通俗宣傳也　以數千年習慣相承之舊醫，驟欲易以新醫，其格格不相入者，亦事與勢使之然也，有曰新醫爲霸道者，有曰新醫爲只知頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚者，甚至有挖眼作藥，重症毒死等無稽談話，故在吾國之爲新醫者，不僅宜致力於醫術上之研究，尙負有對通俗宣傳之任務，使社會明瞭新醫之内容如何，優劣如何，而後始可推行無阻，（鄙人有請全國各地醫師公會設立通俗醫學演請提案於本屆大會）此鄙人之所希望者三也。</p>
<p>（四）宜救濟貧病也　吾國際此經濟恐慌農村破産之候，而疾病之發生，誰得而避免之，貧病之稱謂，可謂名符其實矣，然則有賴於政府之救濟耶，政府自謀之不暇，有賴於社會之救濟耶，社會亦因苛捐重稅而不堪命，然則赱之於醫歟，醫亦或於社會經濟之恐慌，而受其影響，雖然，當仁不讓，吾自爲之，故凡對於貧病之可以救濟者則救濟之，此鄙人之所希望者四也。</p>
<p>（五）宜注意於衛生行政與醫學敎育也　醫師豈僅以診病而已矣，當此過度時代，對於衛生行政與醫學敎育，亦宜注意及之，現在衛生行政之設施，其果能滿足吾人之所期望乎，全國之醫學校，足以産生所需要之醫師乎，舊有之醫學校，果宜一一　停閉乎，新來完備之醫學校，果巳一一呈現於吾之眼臉乎，衛生客鄕之設計，適合於吾國之國情乎，凡此種種，對於國權，對於醫學，均有深切之關係，吾人當鄭重注意，評其得失，此鄙人之所希望者五也。</p>
<p>上述種種，不過就余管見所及，約略陳之，當茲大會之日，四方來者，均爲一時俊彦，對于吾國醫事之改進與設施，當必謀之熟而籌之深矣，固無待鄙人之再爲喋喋，茲略述數語者，徒欲貢其芻蕘，尙祈到會諸公，進而敎之，則幸甚矣。</p>
<h3 id="c81">中國醫事前途急待解决之幾個根本問題（上） <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 胡定安</p>
<p>醫學未臻發達，醫事未上軌道，衛生設備尙未完全之國家如吾中國者，因地廣人稠，在吾醫界立塲，應起而亟謀醫事前途有光明之趨向，實爲必要之國，而當國是未定危亡震撼之時，吾醫界鑒於國内醫事之愈趨糾紛，自應爲國家，爲學術，顧全大局，相忍共濟，尤爲迫不及待之要舉，謙就蠡測之見，願與國人共商榷之。</p>
<p>原夫醫事有關於民族民生也甚巨，而所謂擔負實際醫事上工作之人才與全國人口相比之率，决無人滿之患，蓋可斷言，在吾嚮無醫學基礎之中國，學者罕出，必須集合多數吸收世界醫學藥學新智識分子，對於醫事建設立之總力最，始可期其表現，今以全國少數之醫藥專門人才，微薄之醫事建設能力，苟斤斤於派别之爭與門戶之見，其間相抵相消，殆有礙於進步之影響顯現潛伏，靡有已時此非所以謀國家醫事發展之試與促醫藥學術漸趨獨立之近於實踐也，吾人若不關念中國醫事前途則已，如欲探求目前醫事現狀而遽謂已上軌道者，吾敢信爲必無其人，　是推叩其故，醫事糾紛之前因後果與夫此後能否補救挽留之希望，復研其癥結所在，關於中國醫事前途有待於急切求解决之幾個根本間題，實不容忽視耳。</p>
<p>其一所謂醫界全體之能力問題也　因中國醫藥人才尙感缺乏，以故能力之能否集中，關於總力量之表現，關係甚密，按今日之情勢，縱絶醫界全體　　表現總力量，但與各國醫學之進步趨勢相較，猶虞不足，必無疑義，可見醫界　力在中國現况下之應力求經濟，與設法補救防制分散，其事實巳甚明顯，倘能力緣各種原因而致分散，只貽醫事上之畸形發展，無補於整個國家方面之利益與醫學方面之積極進步，尤以能力運用方式之不同，其結果之所屬於消極與積極，在醫學言，或爲建設，或爲破壞（一）　（二）</p>
<p>，亦要在醫界能力發揮如何耳，苟其以民族觀念國家地位，與學術進化爲前提而對醫政有所主張者，蓋亦認得眞確之目的爲醫事抱犧牲也，其用意之正大無私，當自有公評，亦無非矚望醫事前途消除黯淡而現光明耳，茲略舉數例，以證能力之運用，在國家觀點上，必須求其集中，而醫界之能否團結與合作，亦　　（三）　（四）</p>
<p>即在視其能力效果何若而得其究竟也。　　譬如第一圖所示、各個能力表現、完全背道而馳、單獨活動、旣乏互助之精神，又無團結之意義，醫界各個分子之能力，苟作如是觀，能力效果，完全消失，分崩離析之現象立現，醫學欲謀一致進步，其可得乎，譬如第二圖與第三圖所示，能力運用之方向或相一致，或相　　（五）　　（六）</p>
<p>違背，或單獨活動，亦有向各方向無規則之集合，此二圖均散漫無一定之標凖，故從可證明集合之力量薄弱，仍不免於混亂狀態，醫事之不上軌道，亦可以此况之。</p>
<p>譬如第四圖所示，小部分能力有集中的趨勢，而大部分能力仍屬分散，第五圖所示，大部分能力集中，而小部分　　（七）　　（八）</p>
<p>力量分散，此中力量，因主張與目的各各不同，彼此不能避免有所減損，就醫事狀况而言，在中國尤廳取加倍努力之蹊徑，萬不能存有如此現象而能期望進步與建設也。</p>
<p>譬如第六圖所示，只有小部分能力勉强集中，而因大部分互生障碍，雙方力量即因此而被消減，第七圖所示，各　　（九）　　（十）</p>
<p>個能力分别受互爲牽制之特殊拘束，其效能即等於零，完全屬於消極方面之趨向，設中國醫事釀成此種局面，對於謀進步與建設，當亦無從談起。</p>
<p>譬如第八圖所示，雖有能力集中之局面，因組織團體之力量减弱，即不能發生促事業進行之力量，以醫事而喻，設多成立各種力量薄弱之醫事團體，不如合多數能力，爲一致之目的，以求大規模眞正團結之團體産生，而有益於國家建設。</p>
<p>譬如第九圖所示，係大部分力量分道揚鑣向兩方面集中，取平均對峙勢態，因此亦各無充分力量以達完成之目的，惟保持各不相融與各不相成之局面，證諸醫事，倘有此種敵對現象之醫事團體，不能達精誠團結抛除成見之目的，雙方均不能有特殊之成功焉。</p>
<p>譬如第十圖所示，係整個力量由各方能力完全一致而集中，發生之效果如何，槪可想而知，欲謀中國醫界之精誠團結，惟有以此爲凖則，羅致各方能力，誠意集中，相忍爲國，然後可望醫事之迅速發展及醫學之蓬勃進步也，如只見諸理想，永不能見諸事實，中國醫事前途，暗礁過伏，自可想見，無復有光明之一日矣。</p>
<p>由上以覘醫界之須藉團結合作，而後可使一切醫事糾紛，隨之觸决，在共同目標之中，一致努力，此能力問題似應値得討論者也。</p>
<h3 id="c82">一年來新亞藥廠新藥之成績 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>一年容易，又屆新春，回顧二十二年度我國新醫藥界，並不因市面之不景氣，而仍能蒸蒸日上，各地醫師會之添設，會員之增加，國産新藥紛紛産生，銷路漸開，茲將新亞藥廠而論之，一年中新出品不下數十種，由其最有價値者敵種，探得其詳要，分述如後，此亦我新醫藥界努力之結果，亦爲國産新藥上一頁之光榮史也。</p>
<p>▲一濃康福那心Neocamphonasin”●［康福那心］本爲新亞半成之樟腦水溶液注射劑，發行以來，已屆五載，因其注射時無痛無副作用，頗爲醫界樂用，但樟腦之含量太少，功效較薄，醫界方面頗願新亞製一較濃之樟腦水落液，此種溶解補助藥據文獻所載，對於人體完全無害，注射後並不刺戟組織，對於水及血清得混和溶解，製法則各化學書籍鮮有記載，購諸國外，價格奇昻，製成藥劑，不能與舶來品相競，該廠研究部運獨特之心才，竟能合成自製此種溶劑，用國産天然樟腦製成［濃康福那心］十成樟腦水，應醫界之需要，價格之廉（新定價每盒滅爲六角），外貨遠不能及，即日貨京雜於傾銷也。</p>
<p>▲一雙治拍菌Traospoin。［雙治拍菌］爲二成半樟腦，三成鑒酸奎寗，及加適量按醇製成之注射液，本爲一種極普通之製劑，功效極佳，廣爲醫界樂用，但以上所述之各種成份，非藉油質不能溶化，新亞之［雙治拍菌］，能運用製劑術之奥妙，不溶於油而溶於水，依余之經騐，［雙治拍菌］之粘稠度，僅及油製品二十份之一，注射時完全無痛，吸收極易，洗凈針筒、不費手續，給醫師不少之便利，尙望該廠與我醫界繼續互相研究，用動物試騐，更進则能注射於皮下或靜脈也。</p>
<p>▲一新亞鈣劑Sinocalcin。［新亞鈣劑］爲葡萄糖酸鈣之製劑，有注射液内服粉劑及藥糖三種，此種同類品最先行銷於我國之市塲上之外貨，售價之昻，不能普及於一般病家，然該藥有獨具之妙，即不論皮下筋肉靜脈均可注射，自［新亞鈣劑］發行以後，售價僅及舶來品三分之一，實因該廠能取廉價之國産，加以化煉，自製原料，近則史進研究用電解法，酸化葡萄糖而與鈣質合成，與余論述甚詳，惜乎屬於該廠製造營業之秘密，不能發表於本紙也，鈣劑本爲萬能治療劑，在昔用氱化鈣注射甚廣，今有優良價廉之［新亞鈣劑］，旣可内服，味亦不惡，並能注射於筋肉，醫家病家受惠不淺也。</p>
<p>▲一皮治樂Pixrol新亞廠曾利用國産米糠製出濃厚之乙種惟他命，依余之經騐，其功效不亞於有名之日貨，其内服液不含酒精等防腐藥，尤爲難得之製劑，近史利用米糠，加以適當之溫度，施行低溫乾溜，所得油液，再行精製，製成一種皮膚病治療劑［皮治樂］，功效遼在依克度松溜油之上，並無剌戟等副作用，此等利用國産原料製成之新藥，吾等急宜宣揚而扶植之，故代爲記述，以告我醫界諸公之採用也。</p>
<p>一利凡命（星牌肝膏製劑）Liremin。我國人口衆多，供食用罕殺之動物，爲較甚巨，所有臟器一部份，雖供食用，然價格極廉，臟器製劑之研究，在吾國爲</p>

<p>好之機會，且各國對於　器製品，風起雲湧，盛極一　，新亞廠曾有睪丸賀爾蒙製劑賀　賜　會］之發行，近則創製肝齊製劑［利凡命］，據該廠製造者云，先經獨特之機械，脫脂脫水後，再用適當溶劑抽出其有數成份肝臟賀爾蒙，其製造時之溫度，始終未出攝氏六十度以上，故所得之成份較多，補血功效亦大，所製之粉劑，用特障臟　藥混合·故不易潮解，較　製之肝膏粉，易於保存，久諸不致變色而結塊，此亦較舶來品進步之點，亦足以爲國貨自豪若也，其注射劑經余之經騐，其濃度色澤功效極似德國新出之［肝補儂］，國産新藥中有價値之出品也。</p>
<p>結論　我國製藥事業，原屬幼穉，新醫使用之藥品，盡屬舶來，普通市販之成藥，純爲外國藥品之一種混合調製，近數年來，藥廠輩出，漸知改良研究，最初僅一　醫師使用之注射劑，其内容所含之原料，以及盛藥之硬質安瓴，悉仰諸國外之輸入，及至金價暴漲，抵制日貨，新亞藥廠首先著目於硬質安瓴之自製，苦心經營，巳能自給自用，至去年大加擴充，漸注意於原料之化製，新藥之合成，一年來有如是之成績，較諸往昔之製藥界，則不可道里計矣，尙望藥界同志，努力前進，加鞭研究，並願醫界同志，盡力提倡，廣爲宣傳，則國貨前途幸甚，新藥前途幸甚。</p>

<p>— 老</p>
<p>一世寃家幾日仙。無端功過判天濃。病應不死醫豈學。福自前生藥有緣。挨擲聲名　負責。每逢訟累要牽連。模梭千載江湖訣。旣賣交情又賣錢。</p>
<p>記得本刋初發行的時節。申報的主人史量才先生對我說。本刋的宗旨。累然是宣傳科學醫藥。但是究竟爲一般社書的普通讀物。希望我常常做些滑稽文字在上面。比較可以引起些讀者的興趣。一年以來。我實在没有什麽趣話可說。着實辜負了史先生的囑託。現當廿三年元旦。本報又出特刋。倘若再是談沉悶的醫藥。又不免病呀死呀的不討利市。但是我們這本行裏面。又說不出什麽吉祥話　因此本文開場。勉强來一首打油詩。也算新年新歲。請諸君聽彈詞一様。又記得元明人做小說。往往在正文上面。加上一個什麽楔子。於是我這一首打油詩和一大套廢話。就拿來當做楔子罷。可是我並不會做小說。本文也不是小說。以下的記載。不過是社會上的事實。請大家想一想而已。閒言少數。非　非馬的說書來了。</p>
<p>却說上面這首詩。單表中國歷來醫家養成了一種習慣。就是不負責任。但是這不負責任的惡習。也不是醫家一方面造成的。乃是病家把醫家忽而看重。忽而看輕。一會兒看的像仙家這様神秘。一會兒又看得像奴僕這様鄙視。冷冷熱熱。實在難受。醫家自想。也不過是一個人。僅僅比病家多曉得些醫理。所以敢負那生命上的責任。但是有時回天無術。力不從心。究竟不是犯刑法上的故意傷害。但是病家却恨如切骨。　好像除掉這個醫生之外。必定有長生不老的方藥。而天下没有不治的症候。也不應有偶然的惡運。所以人死之後。對於醫家無不咀咒。要是病好了呢。也許還要感謝祖宗有靈。上天保佑。或者不是醫家的功勞。必定是藥物的緣分。况且出錢請醫。已經學術代價收付兩訖。確乎不應再有什麽意外酬勞。而在醫家方面算去。權利義務之外。凈賺一番咀咒。覺得太不公平。於是慢慢養成了卸責諉過的風氣。所以老法開脈案的末了。總有幾句嚇人的語調。呌作［愼防厥變］呌作［防久病轉虛］呌作［防邪陷致重］等等說法。口氣之間。是呌病家防。並不是他方子内已經防好。將方藥中防　可防的事。交給病家。豈不是卸責。還有從前讀兩句書的人。都能懂得些醫理。於是醫家就怕他咀咒起來。更爲利害。所以脈案後面。就來一句［姑擬某某某之法即請主政］。或者已有他醫看過。再加上句［法家丨丨主政］。意思是說病雖我治。藥的吃得吃不得。還請他人商量和主人翁自己斟酌。這就是諉過卸責兼而有之。但是如今新醫無脈案可開。無卸責諉過的文字。只好口頭討論。而口頭的言語。没有癙據。往往由病家抓住醫家一兩句負責任的話。作爲病人死後辦交涉的本錢。况且現在新醫開方尙用西文。病家自認不識。不好來什麽主政。等到病人死後。忽然說道［什麽藥吃得不對］。［某某針打得太多］。居然也可以請律師做入狀子裏告到公堂上去。因此現在的新醫。也要慢慢的走向不負責任的一條路上去了。其實諸位想想。對於整個的醫療多麽不利啊。一家病家請了五六個醫師。弄得一個也不肯開方于。大夥只來個唯唯否否。眞合着俗語所謂［鬼相打難爲了病人］罷咧！</p>
<p>有一次有一個醫師。被人家急急邀去診一小兒。去的時候小孩子面靑息窒。滿房間香烟繚繞。診斷下來。是氣管枝炎肺炎。趕緊開一次窗換過空氣。重又在房内替他們布置噴霧蒸氣。又急急用養氣吸入法補救窒息。一時病情大有轉機。小兒的父母幾乎對那醫師磕頭。一天之内忙忙的連請再診三次。那醫師又替他請了特别護士當心看。自以爲如此重症。如此信仰。應該負責的了。於是繼續用些射等藥。不幸那小孩子　半夜裏。忽因心臟麻痺。突然脈止而死。那病家過了兩天。大講一條醫理。說强心針生生把小兒打死的。將面靑窒息。滿房香烟的危象忘了。診金都不願付了。</p>
<p>有一次一個小兒科醫師　替一個腥紅熱的小孩子打了二次血清。過了一個禮拜。腥紅熱已好了。發起血清病來。以爲血清足以殺人。反用了些不相干的方法去治血清病。不知怎様吃糟了藥。把小孩子丢了。於是要和那初診醫師打官司。把腥紅熱的病也不忘了。</p>
<p>又一次一個小孩子病痢疾。經一個醫師替他診治數天。寒熱正在略退的時候。那醫師自不小心。說了一句一病勢今日見輕成者不要緊］的話。那曉得晚上病情驟變。小孩忽然痺厥而死。等醫師趕到。已是不救。只落得那小孩的娘大哭大駡。說我的孩子被你躭誤了。這是没有寫兩句［愼防］［謹防］的毛病。</p>
<p>又一次一個軍官的太太。生白喉生了好多天　已在埀危。纔請西醫。經那醫師替她打上大量的血清。實在因時期太遲。依舊不救。這一下可不得了。軍官居然把醫師押起來要搶斃。好容易做好做歹。拿這件案子正式移入司法官廳審理。又用許多學理證明無罪。總算虎口餘生。醫師活命。只好遠走他鄕。避其鋒鏑</p>
<p>新近一個律師的老婆。生産以後。得了菌痢。在那産科醫院裏。雖然只打過二次血清。就出院另請他人治療數天。藥固對症。病竟不起　也是常有之事。然而那律師居然在法院裏面進上洋洋數千言的狀子。告那産科醫師玩忽業務。開庭正開得熱鬧咧。</p>
<p>諸如此類的［謗醫］。恐怕天天都有。也眞是記不勝記。在刻薄的人說起來。也許是要賴掉醫金的一種方法。在忠厚的人說起來。那些小孩子和老婆。是最關情性的。所以死了小孩子和老婆。就往往與醫家爲難。倘然死了高年的父母。恐后倒要好些。然而我看竟未見得。因爲我常常接到那些太府君太夫人的訃告。而訃告的附屬品。總有一份哀啓。哀啓的後面。索性大書特書說道。［初延中醫斷爲某症丨丨旣延西醫針治僅見微效丨丨友好皆以爲耆　之徵丨丨論其病象决非倉卒不及醫治之症不孝等　不知醫貽誤至此抱恨終天］云云。其意若曰。他的長輩决定不死。　以要死。死在庸醫治法不合。他若學醫。定能救得父母長生不老。其實要盡孝道。另有别法。何必在文字裏面彰明較著的謗醫。來作孝字的末節呢？</p>
<p>咳！專重情感和虛文。不求　智和實益。是無補的啊。欲知中國醫界如何。也只好且聽將來分解的了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Year and Hope <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Generally, people's minds are such that they conclude the various events of the past year on New Year's Eve, and begin everything anew on the first day of the year. Therefore, whenever the seasons are renewed, everyone embraces hope, and every household is filled with vitality. The atmosphere is refreshed, with a sense of vigor and aspiration. Now, the year of the Republic of China 22 has become a thing of the past, and the 23rd year begins today. Can the people of our nation truly foster some kind of hope in their hearts during this new year? This is a question worth asking.</p>
<p>Currently, within the country, the rural areas are desolate, and industry and commerce are weary and depleted. External troubles are becoming increasingly urgent, and internal worries are deepening. In these difficult times, those who have already suffered spiritually may find only pessimism, even on New Year's Day, with little hope to speak of. However, hope is the driving force behind active struggle. Without hope, activity has no source. Even if one desires to strive, there is a lack of purpose. The result is only resignation to fate and self-abandonment. Therefore, for the sake of social progress, we deeply wish that the people of our nation, in this year of many difficulties, will not abandon hope for the future. They should summon their courage, strengthen their will, and forge ahead to recover from past failures.</p>
<p>People's hopes differ, even to the point of being contradictory. However, regarding one's own nation and country, the hope for its survival and prosperity is universal. Why is this? Because the survival and prosperity of the nation and the country, except for a few who seek personal gain by betraying the nation to prolong their lives, is a prerequisite for anyone or any group to achieve their hopes of progress and elevation. Otherwise, if the skin is gone, where will the fur attach? Individuals and groups will lose their protection and be unable to realize their hopes.</p>
<p>In today's China, which is in a perilous state, we do not wish to speak grandly or harbor extravagant expectations. Therefore, what we hope for is quite simple: unity and unanimous resistance to external threats, to maintain the survival of our nation and gradually seek its development. To achieve national unity, although there are many ways, too numerous to count, the most important is to remove the obstacles to unity. To remove obstacles, we must hope that all parties will abandon their personal grudges and serve the country with sincerity, seeking an early end to internal strife. For if internal strife does not cease, the roots of mutual slaughter will not be removed, and how can there be any possibility of unity? As for unanimous resistance to external threats, in today's China, it is not difficult as long as there are those with leadership abilities who guide with sincerity. Since the September 18th Incident, China has suffered deeply, and the people's hearts are filled with sorrow and indignation. The people have long hoped for unanimous resistance to external threats, fearing only that they cannot achieve it.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, I happened to read Li Jianong's old book, "A Political History of China in the Last Thirty Years," and could not help but feel overwhelmed with emotion, not knowing where my tears should fall. The last section of the book, entitled "The Way Forward," was particularly poignant. I now transcribe a few sentences from it:</p>
<p>"Before us, clearly, there are only two paths: one is the path to death, and the other is the path to life... What is the path to life like? First, it is to stop the meaningless mutual slaughter and restore social stability... Second, to maintain social stability, it is necessary to give the general outstanding members of society the freedom to speak, advise, and criticize, and to give the general public the opportunity to distinguish right from wrong, cultivate the ability of society to distinguish right from wrong, and thereby generate powerful public opinion..."</p>
<p>"We are now at a fork in the road of life and death. The life and death of the entire nation are entirely in the hands of the leaders. If the leaders have the sincerity to protect the nation, they should recognize this fork in the road of life and death. The general outstanding members of society should also recognize this fork in the road of life and death. Only then will the Chinese nation have the hope of lasting prosperity. This is my view on the way forward."</p>
<p>"The longer the turbulent situation lasts, the more stagnant the culture becomes, the more the productive labor and capital decrease, and the more the forces of imperialism expand."</p>
<p>"If the chaos continues, what other options will the Chinese people have besides becoming consumers of foreign products, working as beasts of burden for foreigners, and being driven around by foreigners? Isn't this a dead end for the Chinese nation and society?"</p>
<p>Li's book was published in October of the 19th year of the Republic of China. Time passes, and circumstances change. Today's situation is already vastly different from what it was then. However, it remains true that our nation is at a crossroads of life and death, not yet out of danger. Not only are we not out of danger, but we may be even more endangered than before. Therefore, when speaking of hope today, the words still seem to have value for reference, at least enough to serve as a reflection and warning for the people of our nation.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Prospects for 1934 <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>1.  Worries and Calamities Pressing, Still Without End,</p>
<p>We, in China, have been crying out about national crisis for four years now. In the past three years, let us examine ourselves to see what our situation really is. Has the national crisis been alleviated by the cries of the people of our nation? Have the enemies been deterred from further aggression by our cries? The facts show us that the national crisis has not only not been alleviated, but has become more serious. The events in the three northeastern provinces remain as before, and there are even more serious situations. I am afraid that losing Jehol will not be the end. The warnings from Chahar are clear evidence. Because Japan's current international position and its internal situation do not allow it to take further military adventures. As for the market seized by force, we in China, of course, cannot launch foreign struggles with a broken national economy. The powerful nations competing for victory in the Far East cannot abandon their own countries and suddenly resort to military struggles. However, diplomatic maneuvers and economic restraints are very intense. If Japan really uses force to seize the Far Eastern market, then those who rise up to economically suppress Japan will not only be the United States of North America on the other side of the Pacific. Even England, which is sometimes wary of Japan, can hardly guarantee that it will not join the United States to restrain Japan. The Soviet Union in the north will also take the opportunity to launch a sudden attack on Japan. Therefore, Japan uses the name of peace, saying that it is refreshing diplomacy, in order to ease the re-deterioration of the relations between the various countries in the world and Japan.</p>
<p>However, Japan's so-called continental policy, although temporarily not adopting a proactive attitude due to the harsh diplomatic environment, is in fact only a slight pause in the southward policy. In the north, especially towards Inner Mongolia and North Manchuria, it is still very aggressive. Even if it does not use troops in the short term, its political brewing is still advancing rapidly. We see that the newly established Research Department of its Ministry of Foreign Affairs pays special attention to the investigation of Asia, and in the investigation of Asia, it pays extra attention to the Inner Mongolia area. From this we know that this problem is extraordinary.</p>
<p>So, what about ourselves? The most ominous year of 1933 has already been barely endured in storms. What about this year? Judging from the general situation, especially economically, in the past year, China's economy can be said to have collapsed to the extreme. In all the large and small cities across the country, there is no place that does not sigh that the market is bad and the status quo is difficult to maintain. As for the rural areas, whether it is a place of good harvest or a place of drought, they all deeply feel that the crisis of bankruptcy is imminent, and there is no way to protect themselves! What should this year be like? Judging the future based on the past, I am afraid that the component of pessimism is more than the component of optimism. On the one hand, judging from the current world situation, the symbol of market improvement is still not reliable; on the other hand, China itself has no possibility of independent transformation, so the industry and commerce in the cities and the agriculture in the countryside are all trapped in the abyss of panic, and no bottom is seen.</p>
<p>2.  1936, the dangerous eve,</p>
<p>The deepening of the world economic panic has been transmitted to China. Among the advanced countries, because of their historical resistance and their artificial perfunctory efforts, the surface seems to be gradually stabilizing, especially in England, the United States, and Japan, it seems that the panic frenzy is about to pass; but we carefully study the reality, and we know that England's domestic unemployment problem has not been truly resolved, and the current stability bottom is very fragile after all. Just by abandoning the gold standard and implementing the alliance within the British Empire, it is enough to prove that raising prices cannot save the poverty of the industrial world, nor can it stimulate the consumption power of the general public. As for the economic alliance within the British Empire, it also contains the centrifugal tendency of the various autonomous territories and colonies, then the substantiality of the current stable situation is very thin. In the United States of North America, since the implementation of the Blue Eagle Movement, industrial revival seems possible. Last September, the number of unemployed people was also reduced from more than 11.5 million to 10.7 million; compared with the same period last year, prices increased from 68 to 88 in November of last year; the industrial production index (based on 1928) also increased from 59 to 75 in September of last year compared with the same period last year; these seem to be signs of improvement, and they are all symbols of prosperity coming again this year. But if we try to study it further, we understand that the rise in prices is due to the reason of currency inflation, and the increase in the industrial production index is an artificial stimulus. The goods are only moved from this stack to that stack, and in fact they have not fallen into the hands of consumers. Then the role of the Industrial Revival Act can also be said to be extremely subtle, as for talking about overcoming the economic panic, that is even further away.</p>
<p>Japan's economic situation seems to be stronger than that of England and the United States, and other capitalist countries. For example, based on 1928, its industrial production index in August of last year increased by 24 compared with the same period last year, prices also increased from 134 in the previous year to 143 last year, and the number of unemployed people decreased by 150,000. However, we know that Japan's government and the public are madly shouting "extraordinary period," "super extraordinary period," "the arrival of the crisis in 1936", in order to stimulate its people and anesthetize its industrial world; on the other hand, it is expanding its budget and issuing its public debt 丨 that is, the policy of currency inflation, reducing the value of money, invisibly raising prices, and adding the rise of the military industry, shifting military consumption to society, so the accumulation of military supplies and the continuous manufacturing of military supplies have covered up the image of commodity accumulation. The war madness of the extraordinary period covers up the pain of life for a time. In fact, the economic panic in Japan is still expanding, and the lives of the general public are also suffering from severe oppression, and the crisis of panic is becoming more and more serious every day. We see that in the past ten months of last year, there were 1.18 million cases of reported crimes in Japan, not to mention that crimes related to political relations and ideological problems were caused by the economic panic, even the bribery of primary and secondary school teachers and principals, the sale of doctoral degrees by universities, and other corrupt things, how can they not be caused by economic relations. Then what is the actual nature of Japan's so-called unique economic prosperity? In political instability, parliamentary politics has long been defeated and unable to gain the faith of the people, and the power of the warlords is also strong outside and weak inside, and they cannot completely subdue the financial groups, nor can they truly unify their military forces, so its political and economic difficulties are the same as those of other countries, but they have changed a term and shouted extraordinary period.</p>
<p>3.  This year's trend,</p>
<p>Now, among all countries in the world, whether they are advanced or backward capitalist countries, or colonies or semi-colonies, they have all been groaning in an environment of poor markets in the past three years, and although they have tried all kinds of methods, they are still unable to extricate themselves. Only the Soviet Union has struggled to build a socialist road in the midst of the capitalist encirclement with the strength of its entire people, and as a result of the people's frugal living, it has actually created a good image different from other countries in the world economic panic. The general trend of other worlds can probably be divided into the following items:</p>
<p>1.  The United States has announced its approval of the Silver Agreement. In the next four years, the United States will purchase 244.21 million ounces of silver, and at the same time use 50% of the silver produced by the mines for coinage; then, in the future, the ratio of silver to the US dollar can be increased, in other words, the value of the US currency can be reduced, and the general purchasing power can be increased accordingly, and the prosperity of the market can be expected. However, it is not necessarily the case in practice. First, because the regulations on the highest and lowest wages have limited the income of the general public, even if wages are increased equally with the currency price, prices will also rise in the same way. Isn't the result still the same? What's more, after the price of silver increases, especially in China, where silver is used in the East, after the value of money increases, prices will fall accordingly, and the consumption power of the general public will inevitably be lower. I am afraid that the trend of economic panic will be even more severe this year than last year.</p>
<p>2.  Although the Silver Agreement has been approved by the United States and India, the currency war continues, and the method of currency stability is still not easy to obtain, and in addition to the opposition between the gold standard countries and the non-gold standard countries, the currency war will be transformed into a tariff war! The more fierce the tariff war, the more serious the economic alliance will be. The British Empire economic alliance has already had a considerable foundation, and the United States will inevitably strive to restrain North and South America; each will strengthen its sphere of influence and try its best to develop outward. Japan hopes to monopolize the Far Eastern market, and at the same time, it is opening up to the South Pacific Islands, to India, and to South America. Therefore, their opposition and conflicts are becoming more and more intense.</p>
<p>Moreover, this kind of economic struggle, currency war, tariff war, economic alliance, etc., have brought out all the methods, on the one hand, to strengthen the walls of their own country, and on the other hand, to break through the other side's dikes. Once the peaceful 丨 bloodless 丨 economic method has become powerless, it will evolve into armed struggles. Although we do not have to think that a world war will break out next year or the year after, the more intense the economic struggle, the more deeply we China will suffer.</p>

<p>— By Force</p>
<p>(1) The Pacific: A Sense of Impending Storm</p>
<p>Four hundred years ago, the Spanish explorer Magellan sailed around the world in the "San Antonio." As the ship passed through South America, the Pacific was filled with a gentle spring breeze and clear, blue waters. Overjoyed, he couldn't help but sing, "Sea of Peace!"</p>
<p>But this "Sea of Peace," in the 20th century, has become the focus of intense scrutiny by the great powers. The gentle spring breeze and clear, blue waters of the Pacific now give one a sense of an impending storm. "World civilization has always been centered on the oceans... Initially, the Mediterranean was the center. After the fall of Rome, the prosperity of the Mediterranean became a historical relic. Then, the Atlantic rose to take its place, but it, too, is now declining. Replacing the Atlantic is the 'Pacific Era.' The Pacific Era unites all of humanity, marking a brighter page in human history. The people of the East and West confront each other with the Pacific as the center. The mission of the Americans is to stand tall in this new movement and advance to the forefront of the battle!" This was the bold statement of former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>South African Governor-General Smuts also declared at a session of the Imperial Parliament, "The three protagonists, America, Britain, and Asia, have now met in the Far East. The most critical chapter in human history has begun in the Far East."</p>
<p>The Pacific is the world's largest ocean, accounting for about half of the global water area and one-third of the total surface area. Whether this vast ocean can be fully utilized is crucial to the prosperity of human life. Countries surrounding this ocean, such as China or its dependencies, including Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and the Soviet Union, as well as India, Australia, South Africa, and South American countries, account for more than half of the world's nations. The so-called Pacific problem is the conflict arising from how each of these countries seeks to utilize the power of this ocean for the development of their industry, trade, military affairs, diplomacy, immigration, food supply, and culture. The key players who can shift and resolve this problem are, in fact, Britain, the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If China does not catch up and strive for major reforms in politics and economy, laying the foundation for the nation to cope with the狂潮 of this new era, then once the impending fate of this ocean arrives, everything will be in a passive position, subject to the will and manipulation of others. Wouldn't it be a waste to be one of the nations on this ocean?</p>
<p>(2) The So-Called "1936"</p>
<p>After the European War of 1914-1917, most countries showed signs of decline. Although some countries achieved畸形 development, it was unknown that this development was exchanged for the sacrifice of most countries. When there was nothing left to sacrifice, the foundation of the country based on the sacrifice of other countries was bound to shake. In addition, the internal contradictions of capitalist economy became increasingly acute, and the unprecedented world panic of 1929 occurred. It has been almost five years now, not only without any hope of improvement, but also intensifying. Repeated international conferences have all failed, making the atmosphere of terror even more tense. As a result, the call of countries to "Go to the Pacific!" has grown louder, seeing the Pacific as their last bet, as if there is no way out without the Pacific. Japan says, "Japan is the master of the Pacific. Asia is for Asians. Who can be a guest usurping the role of the host?" The United States says, "The Pacific should implement the open door and equal opportunity." Britain says, "No one shall infringe upon the vested rights of the British Empire." The Soviet Union pretends to be unaffected, remaining silent, but intensifies the completion of its second five-year plan. Its intentions are obvious to all. Although the policies are different, the goal of obtaining Pacific hegemony is the same. These absolutely irreconcilable policies of various countries are bound to provoke a frontal conflict, with swords drawn against each other one day. The general public believes that the day of this conflict is not in the distant future of ten or a hundred years, but most likely in the imminent year of 1936; that is, the Pacific will begin to be turbulent and cloudy in just two years in 1936. Why? Because before 1936, there were two difficult hurdles to overcome.</p>
<p>First, Japan announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations on March 27th of last year. Next year, that day will be when the withdrawal officially takes effect, and the League of Nations should recover the mandated islands in the South Pacific. In particular, international supporters of the League and the government of Germany's Hitler, whose main political program is to recover lost territories, will undoubtedly make strong claims. Even if Japan can ignore the claims of these weak countries, the military significance of the South Pacific islands to Britain and the United States is very important, and they will gladly support the claim for recovery. If Japan abandons the mandated islands in the South Pacific, it will be very easy for British and American fleets to navigate the Pacific, and Australia and the Philippines can avoid being threatened, forcing Japan to surrender without a fight. Therefore, for Japan, the South Pacific governance issue is not just a matter of small islands scattered like stars, but in fact a matter of maintaining or losing its lifeline in military strategy. The more urgent the demands of Britain, the United States, and Germany to recover the islands, the more vehemently it will refuse. Regardless of the diplomatic negotiations, the two opposing and serious positions on these islands will inevitably evolve into a struggle in which each side pours its national strength into competing.</p>
<p>Second, the Naval Disarmament Treaty signed in Washington in 1922 will expire in December 1936; the London Naval Treaty signed in April 1930 will also hold a revision conference in 1935. Looking back at the signing of the above two treaties, Japan, succumbing to the powerful naval forces of Britain and the United States, nominally agreed to the 5:5:3 ratio, but always thought of revenge; it will not easily miss the opportunity in the next revision conference and will demand equal naval opportunities. At the Geneva Disarmament Conference, Japan had already proposed a ratio of 73% for battleships and 83% for large cruisers, but it was unable to fulfill its wishes due to international circumstances. In the future, it will definitely insist on it. Therefore, the focus of the future conference disputes will undoubtedly be this.</p>
<p>For this reason, the world believes that 1936 will be the time of the Pacific crisis. Is that so, or is it not?</p>
<p>(3) The Naval Competition Warning of Britain, the United States, and Japan</p>
<p>The naval situation of a country reflects its national policy. To understand the trends in the national policies of various countries, their naval situations should be reviewed. Today, the countries that dominate the world's navies are Britain, the United States, and Japan. The recent naval competition among these three countries is briefly described below...</p>
<p>Because Britain experienced a fleet rebellion in 1931, it had to reduce its naval expenses, resulting in little progress in the construction of new warships in the past. According to the London Treaty, by 1936, Britain had the right to build 292,000 tons of auxiliary vessels, but it has only implemented two-fifths of it. Those under construction are 120,000 tons, and those not yet started are 50,000 tons. However, in mid-November of last year, Naval Minister Monsell strongly advocated the necessity of promoting warship construction in Parliament and proposed to amend the warship construction plan to build two 9,000-ton cruisers and one 5,000-ton cruiser this year. Although this cannot be considered a strong naval competition, the competition within the scope of the treaty has been fully expressed.</p>
<p>The United States has always adhered to the principle of large ships and large guns, paying little attention to the construction of auxiliary vessels. This tendency is clearly demonstrated by past facts. For example, after the Washington Conference, the United States first began to renovate and refresh battleships. Seven have been renovated and completed, and three are still under renovation. The cost of this renovation is about 160 million gold yuan. Furthermore, judging from the situation after the London Treaty, the United States originally had the right to build 250,000 tons of light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines according to the treaty (by 1936), but only started construction of eight destroyers by last spring. On the one hand, it gave up most of the construction rights of auxiliary vessels, and on the other hand, it focused all its efforts on the construction of 8-inch cruisers. Seven ships have been completed after 1930, and six are under construction. This was the U.S.'s past warship construction policy, but in the early summer of last year, the Roosevelt government decided to allocate 560 million gold yuan from the Industrial Recovery Fund for the construction of 32 auxiliary vessels within three years, and construction has already begun. Moreover, Military Order Minister Standley made an informal statement that a second warship construction plan will be submitted to Parliament this spring. This proves that the warship construction situation in Britain and the United States has recently shown a lively appearance.</p>
<p>Regarding Japan, immediately after the London Treaty, it actively established a new warship construction plan: a supplementary large plan of 470 million yen has been completed, which is the so-called "First Supplementary Plan." The "Second Supplementary Plan" is underway. Japan's warship construction is faster than that of Britain and the United States. Since the 918 and 128 incidents, the United States has wanted to make its diplomatic policy towards Japan effective, and it has had to work hard to strengthen its own strength. When Stimson asked Admiral Pratt whether the navy was sufficient, Pratt replied "No." As a result, the diplomatic intensity towards Japan was reduced, and efforts were made to strengthen naval work. As for Japan, the ratio of naval power stipulated in the treaty is only sixty-seven percent of that of the United States, but in fact, after years of supplementary measures, it has reached ninety percent of that of the United States. The intensity of the competition is truly astonishing!</p>
<p>The current active competition among the three countries to supplement naval power has two meanings: one is the significance of national defense itself; the other meaning is to strengthen the power of speech in the 1935 conference. In summary, these two meanings mean nothing more than the struggle for Pacific hegemony. Based on its past efforts and its geographical advantage in the Pacific over Britain and the United States, if Japan further obtains equal naval rights, regardless of whether war breaks out in the future, Japan will inevitably制英美. Conversely, Britain and the United States can制Japan.</p>
<p>(4) The Issue of the Principle of Freedom of the Seas</p>
<p>The so-called principle of freedom of the seas in international law will also inevitably arise with the issue of naval equality in the future. The ocean is divided into two types: territorial waters and the high seas. The former is like territory, with the exclusive possession and exercise of exclusive rights by a certain country as the principle; the latter is that no country has the power to exercise power. The "principle of freedom of the seas" means that the high seas do not belong to any one country, but are completely free and unrestricted. Extreme advocates of freedom of the seas argue that the high seas are completely free in both wartime and peacetime. However, not all international law scholars argue that the freedom of the high seas in wartime should be appropriately restricted, that is, belligerent countries have the right to search neutral ships and detain wartime contraband. This theory has been implemented by belligerent countries in previous wars over the past hundreds of years, and neutral countries have also implicitly recognized it, so it has become a consensus. The issue here is not whether such a consensus is reasonable, but what exactly is "wartime contraband."</p>
<p>In every important war over the past hundreds of years, Britain has always used its powerful navy to attack the enemy and further prevent neutral countries from supplying materials to the enemy. It believes that food, clothing, and other dual-use goods in peacetime and wartime are also wartime contraband and are subject to detention and confiscation. Because Britain has often been a belligerent country in the past, the wider the interpretation of contraband, the more sufficient it is to制 the flow of materials from enemy countries and neutral countries. The United States is the opposite, having often been in the position of a neutral country in the past, often selling its abundant materials to both belligerent parties to reap the benefits. Therefore, it strives to minimize the interpretation of contraband, so as to reduce the opportunity for its own materials to be detained and confiscated by belligerent countries. Disputes often arise between Britain and the United States on this issue. In 1812, they even resorted to arms because of this. The final solution was still not obtained. During the American Civil War, the positions of the two countries were reversed, and the arguments of both sides were also reversed once. By the early days of the European War, the positions and arguments returned to their old state. To this day, the United States is still a proponent of the broad freedom of the seas (that is, interpreting wartime contraband to the minimum). As former Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Borah said, "If Britain does not recognize the principle of freedom of the seas, the United States will only have to build a large navy to implement it with strength," and declared that only the powerful navy of the United States can guarantee freedom of the seas.</p>
<p>As for Japan's position, if the crisis of 1936 is unavoidable, it will undoubtedly be a major belligerent country. Therefore, its interpretation of the freedom of the seas is generally similar to that of Britain. However, in terms of the current situation, the economic opposition between Japan and Britain is very dangerous. Today, people are singing about the inevitable war between Britain and Japan. Once the war really breaks out, Britain, because it has vast colonies, does not need external supplies of wartime materials and can maintain its original argument. Japan, on the other hand, has a poor natural endowment, especially lacking oil, and needs the supply of neutral countries丨丨assumed to be the United States丨丨very urgently. It is more advantageous to advocate the broad principle. The United States is also happy to follow the old wisdom of the European War, selling surplus materials to both belligerent countries and reaping huge profits. Also, assuming that Japan fights with the United States or with the Soviet Union, the situation is similar. The United States and the Soviet Union are far superior to Japan in terms of natural resources. Moreover, Japan also exercises control over the sea over the Sea of Japan, carrying out searches and detentions on all ships sailing to Russia. Even if contraband is interpreted in the broadest sense, direct military supplies such as war equipment and ammunition are still on the list of prohibitions. Therefore, although Japan will be one of the belligerent countries in the future, its advocacy of the freedom of the seas must be consistent with that of the United States, and in opposition to that of Britain. Conversely, if Japan approaches Britain's narrow freedom of the seas, the economic significance of the Pacific to the United States is more important than the military significance. Even if it does not want to fight with Japan, it is feared that its foreign trade will be hindered, and it will inevitably cause the United States to join Japan's enemy and indirectly cause a war.</p>
<p>(5) Soviet Military Preparations</p>
<p>The above is all about the opposition between Britain, the United States, and Japan in the Pacific. Regardless of whether the future war in the Pacific is a war between the Eastern capitalist country Japan and the Western capitalist countries Britain and the United States, or a war between a capitalist country group and the socialist country Soviet Union, and regardless of whether the war breaks out in 1936, Britain, the United States, and Japan have made active preparations, and it is expected that the Soviet Union will have to be vigilant. Due to geographical relations, the Soviet Union has paid attention to naval matters only from the perspective of defense, and has rarely been active on the oceans. Its preparations must focus on the land and air aspects, which is undoubtedly the case. The recent expansion of the Soviet Union's land and air military preparations is truly alarming. Last year, as a result of adding four infantry divisions and one cavalry division, and expanding artillery and aircraft, the total peacetime military strength has been 76 army divisions, 2,200 military aircraft, and 1,600 tanks.</p>
<p>Since the 918 Incident, approximately 110,000 troops, approximately 300 aircraft and tanks each have been increased to the Far East, and among these aircraft, there are dozens of super-heavy bombers with a carrying capacity of seven tons. The air route has been extended to 2,500 kilometers... Permanent barriers have been built in important areas along the border of the Far East region, and the Vladivostok fortress, which has been abandoned for a long time, has also been restored; and it has been decided to send tens of thousands of demobilized Red Army soldiers to the Far East every year to supply temporary replenishment needs, and even to implement poison gas defense education for the people and publicize the importance of gas warfare, which are all worthy of attention.</p>
<p>(6) Conclusion</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the main countries involved in the Pacific, Britain, the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union, are all working to strengthen their military preparations after recognizing the severity of "1936." What about our country? Our country is still dreaming in a drum. Where is the so-called "Three-Year National Defense Plan"? Has the Chinese people ever imagined that our vast Yellow Continent will become a second Balkan? Have they ever imagined that the 525,000-mile coastline will become a battlefield for fleets of various countries to wreak havoc? The Chinese people claim to love peace, even writing it on the doorframes of institutions; peace is indeed loved by everyone in the world, but I have never heard of anyone who is not adequately armed and has the qualifications to proclaim peace.</p>
<p>To seek unification through construction and common governance through balanced power, the most urgent thing is to治標 clear the communist bandits, and the most fundamental thing is to治本.生建设谨将这句老话来</p>
<p>The new year's hope of the 23rd year of the Republic of China is to see how much progress can be made in implementing this old saying this year. New Year's Day</p>

<p>— Hee</p>
<p>(I) The Coincidence of Saito's Formation and Its Impact</p>
<p>Last year on May 15th, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated, and the Seiyukai cabinet collapsed immediately. At this time, regarding the issue of a successor cabinet, the Japanese political situation completely fell into a state of chaos. Whether it would be the Seiyukai cabinet of Suzuki Kisaburo, the Minseito cabinet of Wakatsuki Reijiro, the Fascist cabinet of Hiranuma Kiichiro, or the national unity mixed cabinet of Saito Makoto, all became questions. From the perspective of constitutional normalcy, the Seiyukai held an absolute majority of 305 seats in the Diet, and the imperial command [大命] to form a cabinet should have been given to Suzuki. From the perspective of responsibility, the premiership should have belonged to Wakatsuki, the leader of the opposition party. However, at that time, the Seiyukai had already become the target of public criticism. If Suzuki had formed a Seiyukai cabinet, it would have inevitably ignited a reactionary sentiment, accelerating the bankruptcy of party politics! The Minseito's power in the Diet was extremely weak, and its advocated policies were not as thorough as those of the Seiyukai. It was generally considered insufficient to shoulder the great responsibility during this [extraordinary time]. Both the Seiyukai and the Minseito, aware of their own limitations, dared not repeat the mistake of the Inukai cabinet. However, with Fascism spread throughout Japan, why didn't a Fascist cabinet led by Hiranuma emerge? Simply because the party lacked a unified organization and a central guiding force, it did not have the power to form a cabinet. Otherwise, a Fascist dictatorship would have been established in Japan long ago. Since Japanese Fascist organizations were scattered and opinions were divided, even if the Hiranuma cabinet could have been formed, the political situation would have inevitably entered a chaotic vortex, becoming even more unmanageable! Domestically, it would be impossible to compromise with the various existing forces, and internationally, it would become even more isolated. This was something that the Japanese government and the public could not ignore at that time! However, Japanese Fascists would never abandon their ambition to seize power, but simply believed that the time was not yet ripe. Therefore, to create a transitional regime between party politics and Fascism, the national unity mixed cabinet of Saito Makoto was born in response to the times. The emergence of this kind of regime was because both the Seiyukai and the Minseito realized that they had no possibility of seizing power and did not want party politics to come to an end. Therefore, they also hoped for the appearance of a transitional regime to suppress the arrogance of Fascism. The Seiyukai and Minseito parties spared no effort to support the establishment of the Saito cabinet, and cabinet members from both parties also participated in the cabinet.</p>
<p>Although the Saito cabinet was produced with the vigorous support of the Seiyukai, Minseito, and Fascists, it consistently catered to the military. During its tenure, it dispatched troops to Jehol, withdrew from the League of Nations, and increased military spending. In terms of finance, diplomacy, and military affairs, almost all decisions were made according to the will of the military. In cabinet meetings, although Saito and Finance Minister Takahashi often argued with Army Minister Araki Sadao and Navy Minister Osumi Mineo, they were ultimately subdued by the military.</p>
<p>The Saito cabinet had no consistent policy. It only took the opportunity of the chaos following the May 15th Incident to come onto the stage. Everyone regarded it as a transitional cabinet. It experienced several storms, but its lifespan was able to extend to this day, which was quite unexpected! What enabled it to achieve this was because it had no policy and could hold on to a consistent policy of compromise. If a capable and promising cabinet had been established after the May 15th Incident, the reaction would have been great, and it was feared that Japan would have long become a Fascist world!</p>
<p>(II) Reasons for the Continuation of the Saito Cabinet</p>
<p>Given that the Saito cabinet was an inactive and indecisive regime, it was impossible for it to continue for a long time, nor was it the situation hoped for by the Japanese government and the public. However, all outstanding domestic and international issues had to be resolved fundamentally in the end. Neither the military nor the people would tolerate maintaining the status quo for long. Two tendencies had emerged: one advocated overthrowing the current regime, and the other wanted to partially transform the current regime. The Seiyukai, led by the hard-line faction centered on President Suzuki Kisaburo, advocated overthrowing the current regime and returning to party politics. Because it possessed a power of three hundred and five Diet seats, it was quite qualified to form a cabinet. However, due to the issue of responsibility for the May 15th Incident and the fact that the Seiyukai's methods at the time were unable to resolve the political situation, it had to temporarily cede power to the transitional Saito cabinet. This did not mean permanently abandoning power. Since the establishment of the Saito cabinet, it had constantly hoped to regain power. Moreover, if the Seiyukai remained out of power for a long time, it would be very difficult to maintain control within the party. After the collapse of the Inukai cabinet, three factions had formed within the party: a hard-line faction centered on Suzuki, a cautious faction centered on Tokonami Takejiro, and a national unity faction centered on Kuhara Fusanosuke. The opinions of these three factions became increasingly divergent. If they were not united and reorganized, there was a danger of division. Therefore, Suzuki believed that regaining power was an opportunity for unity and reorganization.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Seiyukai was divided by internal opinions, and on the other hand, it lost the trust of the people. It could not do anything about the Saito cabinet with its own strength alone. This spring, Saito cabinet's Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo had verbally agreed with Suzuki that [he would submit his resignation after the Diet opened on April 20th]. Suzuki believed that Takahashi's resignation could lead to the collapse of the Saito cabinet. Unexpectedly, Takahashi did not fulfill his promise afterward, and Suzuki was greatly disappointed!</p>
<p>The cautious faction within the Seiyukai held different views from the hard-line faction. It did not support overthrowing the current cabinet, but only supported partial transformation. Minister of Education Hatoyama Ichiro, who came from the Seiyukai in the Saito cabinet, held this view. He advocated implementing a [minister without portfolio system] in the current cabinet, with the presidents of the Seiyukai and Minseito participating in the cabinet as ministers without portfolio to make it a powerful cabinet, harmonize conflicts between various factions, and jointly overcome the difficulties of the time.</p>
<p>Kuhara, of the national unity faction, said that the confrontation between political parties was harmful and not beneficial. After one political party gained power, the other party would try to attack and undermine it, regardless of whether it was reasonable or not, causing the ruling political party to be unable to concentrate on politics and instead engage in mutual struggles. If the parties could unite as one, taking the interests of the country as their guide, the drawbacks of party strife could be eliminated. This faction also only advocated transforming the Saito cabinet and opposed fundamentally overthrowing it.</p>
<p>The Minseito had consistently adopted a supportive attitude toward the Saito cabinet, with the concept of government and party. Because its power was isolated and weak, even if the Saito cabinet collapsed, it would not be able to obtain power. It was better for the Saito mixed cabinet to exist, so that it could still get a share of the remaining benefits.</p>
<p>As for the Privy Council, the military, and the National League, which leaned toward Fascism, they could be said to be on the same wavelength. Because the Saito cabinet was obedient to them, they were willing to maintain its continued existence.</p>
<p>(III) From Ministers Without Portfolio to National Policy Coordination</p>
<p>The military, elder statesmen, the Minseito, and various factions leaning toward Fascism had shown a temporary attitude of support for the cabinet. The cautious faction and national unity faction within the Seiyukai also did not advocate immediate overthrow. The hard-line faction within the Seiyukai, which had always been known as a vanguard for overthrowing the cabinet, ultimately softened and compromised due to its own weakness and the harsh environment. This was why the fate of the Saito cabinet was able to continue to exist in a lingering state. The first attempt after escaping the cabinet overthrow crisis was to concentrate the opinions and talents of various political parties, ease mutual conflicts, and increase the strength of the current cabinet in order to cope with the dangerous domestic and international situation. However, the first issue to become a problem was the minister without portfolio system.</p>
<p>The minister without portfolio system was proposed to the Saito cabinet by Minister of Education Hatoyama, who came from the Seiyukai, after obtaining the consent of Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai who had softened. He advocated that Seiyukai President Suzuki and Minseito President Wakatsuki join the cabinet as ministers without portfolio to achieve a thorough national unity cabinet. When Hatoyama presented this opinion to the Saito cabinet, he asserted that [the cabinet only needs to present this proposal to President Suzuki, and he will definitely join the cabinet immediately]. It can be seen that the atmosphere of compromise between Saito and Suzuki was strong! However, as the situation rapidly progressed, the Minseito first expressed its opposition, and President Wakatsuki also stated that [the Minseito is already assisting the cabinet in opposition, and there is no need to follow the Seiyukai in rushing to join the cabinet now!] Cabinet members also felt that opinions were divided on this issue. Although Takahashi and Hatoyama and others worked hard, this proposal was ultimately shelved, and President Suzuki also expressed his refusal to join the cabinet after seeing this complex situation.</p>
<p>The movement to strengthen the cabinet's power was not frustrated by the shelving of the minister without portfolio theory. Following this, there was the move for national policy coordination. Although this move also came from the advocacy of the cautious faction within the Seiyukai, the main promoter was still the military, which was manipulating power behind the scenes. Seeing that the international situation was becoming increasingly tense, relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan and the United States were deteriorating, domestically, they were striving to coordinate political parties and factions and win over financial groups in order to implement their so-called [national unity]. Externally, they wanted to use this movement to establish their [national defense first doctrine]. Looking at the following record, one can see the Japanese military's manipulation of everything.</p>
<p>The national policy proposed by Army Minister Araki was not limited to the military aspect. It included diplomacy, economy, domestic affairs, finance, ideology, etc., attempting to realize its so-called [monistic policy], advocating that behind the military, there should be powerful economic control and powerful diplomacy. That is, attempting to completely place the national industry and finance under military power to satisfy its great desire for dictatorial policy. The various political parties, whose power was increasingly weak and criticized by the whole country, knew that there was no hope of restoring party politics in the current regime, and that they could only strive for compromise with the military.</p>
<p>When Saito began to consult with political parties on national policy, the Seiyukai separately submitted the following five opinions to the government:</p>
<p>(1) Strengthen naval armaments and establish diplomatic policies toward the League of Nations and China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(2) Complete the economic alliance with Manchuria and consolidate Japan's political and economic foundation in Manchuria.</p>
<p>(3) Development and control of the economy and industry.</p>
<p>(4) Reform the administration and eliminate all malpractices.</p>
<p>(5) Stabilize the financial foundation.</p>
<p>The above proposals were not only too empty and impractical, but also did not contradict the military's national policy at all, which shows its spirit of accommodating the military. Although the Minseito said that [a fiscal deficit is a sign of national demise, and filling the deficit is an urgent task], the party followed Saito and never changed its attitude. As for the National League, it originally spoke with one voice with the military. The national policy coordination movement planned by the military would naturally have the same pace. Therefore, one of its leaders, Nakano Seigo, said that [if national unity wants the Saito cabinet to adopt our claims that have already been declared at home and abroad, if they are fully adopted, then we fully agree, if seven parts are adopted, then we agree to seven parts, and there should be no need to be polite!]</p>
<p>(VI) The Five Ministers Conference</p>
<p>Japan was under the dual pressure of domestic and international economic crises and war crises. The government and the public deeply knew that it was not enough to cope with the current difficulties without establishing a national policy of national unity. The Five Ministers Conference was therefore produced under this necessary situation. The so-called Five Ministers Conference, rather than saying that it was concentrating opinions from all sides to establish a unified national policy, it would be better to say that this conference discussed how to realize the national policy proposed by the military. Because the focus of its discussion was all concentrated on the military's proposals. The most important central issue that the military considered was the problem of national defense and military expansion in preparation for war, and its concrete manifestation was in the military budget. The 1934 budget estimate currently submitted to the Ministry of Finance by the Army Department totaled about 1.3 billion yuan, of which the new request reached 800 million yuan. Even if the Minister of Finance tried every means to accommodate the preparation of the budget, it was difficult to achieve harmony between finance and national defense. Because Japanese finance was riddled with holes, and military preparations were expanding without limit, there was a sense of a skeleton dragging a cannon. Political parties had seen this, and Saito and Takahashi had also seen this. Therefore, there were many conflicts between the military and Saito and Takahashi in the past and even during the meeting, all of which were nothing more than the problem of finance and armaments.</p>
<p>What was the harvest of the Five Ministers Conference? According to the announcement issued at the last closing meeting on October 20th, [The Five Ministers Conference exchanged frank opinions on the basics of diplomacy, national defense, and finance. As a result, they gained a deep mutual understanding, created an outline, and their opinions were completely consistent]. In addition, at the provisional cabinet meeting on October 21, 1933, only the following empty resolutions were made regarding the matters decided by the Five Ministers Conference:</p>
<p>(1) Japan's international relations are aimed at world peace, and Japan's policy is implemented through diplomatic means. (2) National defense work is prepared to be free from threats and foreign insults from other countries, and attention is paid to harmonizing Japan's national strength. (October 21st Jiji Press)</p>
<p>The detailed, important, and concrete content obtained by the Five Ministers Conference was not published at all. Only the extremely abstract materials mentioned above were announced by the government. An editorial in the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun on October 24th said [···The so-called Five Ministers Conference has no substance in reality, and the complex political situation in Japan has not made any progress as a result!] An editorial in the Osaka Asahi Shimbun on October 23rd said [···Such a conclusion does not seem to require a special Five Ministers Conference many times. The so-called Five Ministers Conference actually has no result; it is just that irreconcilable claims were forced into understanding under the strong pressure of the military, resulting in a combined opinion!] From this point of view, the true face of the Japanese Five Ministers Conference has been fully revealed. First, this conference was held under the control of the military, and Saito and Takahashi were ultimately subdued by the military. The so-called national policy was largely decided in accordance with the wishes of the military. Second, finance and armaments have not been harmonized; difficulties still exist and there has been no concrete solution. In the future, the Japanese military will be able to exercise its warmongering without being restricted in its actions.</p>
<p>(VII) Will Party Politics Recover or Will There Be Fascist Dictatorship?</p>
<p>At the time of the establishment of the Saito cabinet, it was said to be a transitional regime to restrain the forces of Fascism. If the party cabinet after the collapse of the May 15th Seiyukai cabinet was succeeded, it would further provoke the advance of Fascist forces. After people's hearts returned to stability and social order was restored, power would still return to the political parties. Japanese political commentator Baba Tsunego held this view. However, we should know that the more severe the capitalist crisis in a country, the more highly developed the Fascist movement will be. Japan is in an extraordinary period of many internal and external affairs, and the structure of capitalism is extremely weak, which is a fertile ground for the prosperity and growth of Fascism. Now, the voices of war against the United States and the Soviet Union are getting higher every day, and the domestic economic and financial crisis is deepening every day, which can only promote the gradual realization of the Fascist regime. Araki, representing the forces of Fascism, has a high profile and regards other forces as nothing. He not only holds the full power of military affairs and national defense, but also intervenes in all other facilities. Under the high pressure of this military clique, the Minseito can only follow the Saito cabinet and eke out a meager existence, and has long since given up any delusions of forming a cabinet. Although the Seiyukai occupies a dominant position in the Diet, it has attempted to seize power. However, due to the military's threats and enticements, the cautious faction and national unity faction have actually advocated maintaining the status quo. Even Suzuki, of the hard-line faction, has given up his uncompromising claims and presented national policy to Saito. In addition, the political parties also contain Fascist elements, and are in the midst of a crisis of disintegration, moving toward a path of decline.</p>
<p>In the process of decline, the various political parties have also recently expressed a final struggle. A joint Seiyukai-Minseito constitutional protection movement was launched by a portion of the Seiyukai and Minseito. The main advocates were Kuhara Fusanosuke and Shimada Toshio of the Seiyukai, and Tomita Kojiro, Hyō Son'ichi, and Kobashi Itta of the Minseito. They aimed to protect the collapsing constitution, restore the lost credibility of the political parties, and re-realize party politics. However, Minseito President Wakatsuki and Secretary-General Matsuda and others believed that [the motives of such a union have no great righteousness] and believed that [now is not yet the time] and opposed it. (Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun, evening edition, October 26) Wakatsuki also stated [Even if there is an exchange of opinions between the Seiyukai and Minseito to attack each other, it should not be aimed at overthrowing the cabinet]. (See Yomiuri Shimbun, October 31) Moreover, a portion of the Seiyukai believed that this was the sole decision of Minister of Education Hatoyama and two or three executives, and expressed deep dissatisfaction. (See Yomiuri Shimbun on the same day) How can such a constitutional protection movement with inconsistent paces be expected to succeed? I am afraid it is only a fleeting moment before the fall!</p>
<p>If the so-called [extraordinary time] in Japan has a day to be resolved, then Japanese politics may have hope of restoring party politics. But the resolution of this [extraordinary time] is far away. Can the people of the world dare to believe that the domestic and international situation can return to the situation before the September 18th Incident?</p>
<p>As for the recent internal affairs conference held on December 5th, although the scope of its deliberations was not as broad as the Five Ministers Conference, it actually discussed rural and general social problems. However, the result ultimately did not escape the control of the military, and the conflict between the military and the financial groups was still very obvious. Therefore, the conference continued to be held without results. With the powerless Saito cabinet, under the mutual opposition of the military and financial groups, will the successor to the Saito cabinet be a Fascist dictatorship regime under the guidance of the military?</p>

<p>A Precedent for Nation-Building Through Education</p>
<p>▲ The Educational Policy of the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>The Book of Rites says, "Establishing a nation begins with education." Dr. Sun Yat-sen divided the revolution into three stages, with political tutelage being nation-building through education. He also said, "After the Qin and Han dynasties, the Qing dynasty was the most admirable in its nation-building model." Among them, education deserves special attention. The Qing dynasty viewed China as the British viewed India. Therefore, their nation-building was to establish the Manchu empire, and their nation-building education was actually education for the Manchu people, while what they implemented for the Han people was merely governing education. Dr. Sun Yat-sen also said, "The main reason for the downfall of the Manchus was the eastward invasion of Western civilization. Without this, it might have been possible to extend it for another two or three hundred years." If we wish to establish the foundation of national education, we must not forget these teachings for a moment or be negligent in the slightest. As for why Dr. Sun Yat-sen valued the key points of the Qing dynasty's nation-building through education, I will briefly list them below.</p>
<p>First, the education of the Manchu people was the main focus of Qing dynasty education. This is because what they called nation-building was building the nation of the Manchu people. Like the Canon of Yao, they regarded the Manchu people as "baixing" (the people) and the Han people as "limin" (the commoners). They wanted the "baixing" to be enlightened, while they only wanted the "limin" to live peacefully and not cause trouble. The difference in their intentions was like this. As for what can be said about Manchu education, there are several aspects.</p>
<p>(1) The educational policy focused on practice first and then arts. It emphasized establishing principles and supporting ethics as the foundation, and focusing on practical application as the key. It used the benefit of bows and arrows to awe the world, not rushing to spread fancy rhetoric, but the arts flourished even more. Therefore, everything sought practicality, valuing simplicity, emphasizing frugality, and enforcing strict discipline, using culture as the substance and martial arts as the application. School education did not distinguish between arts and martial arts, and state examinations also included both arts and martial arts. The duties had a division between arts and martial arts, but education had no distinction between arts and martial arts. This was the key.</p>
<p>(2) The people are the foundation of the nation, and the land is for the use of the people. Therefore, the organization of the people is the foundation of the nation's organization, and the organization of the military is the standard of the people's organization. The people and the nation are one, the military and the people are one, and education is carried out among them. The age of compulsory education started at eighteen years old. Parents were responsible for the education of young children under the age of eighteen. When serving in the government or going on expeditions, they were not allowed to bring sons who had not reached the age of education, so as not to neglect their studies.</p>
<p>(3) State examinations, from children's examinations to provincial examinations, all used archery as a subject for evaluation. Those who could not pass the archery test were not allowed to take any examinations.</p>
<p>The failure of Chinese education was largely due to the separation of arts and martial arts. National decline and racial weakness were all due to this. As far as we know about the political situation in the past few hundred years, and what we have seen in the past few decades, either arts suppressed martial arts, or martial arts suppressed arts. In the late Qing dynasty, it was common to see a nominally-appointed governor-general of the first rank and a nominally-appointed brigade general of the second rank serving as clerks for the military officials. A few years ago, it was also seen that a sergeant pulled a county magistrate to see the chief of clerical affairs. This kind of deformed political situation was the result of crisis and chaos, and at the same time, it was its greatest cause. Even the term "civil-military separation" that everyone has often said since the Republic of China is actually unreasonable and impractical. From an administrative point of view, not only should civil and military affairs be separated, but also domestic affairs, foreign affairs, education, and finance. What is not separated? From a political point of view, the ruling power of a country is unique, and the administrative control agencies are also unique. All politics should be under the control of the same political power, the same agency, and the same policy. There is no reason for civil-military separation. From a practical point of view, when a country is in a military period of internal and external troubles, not only general administration should be controlled under military power and exercised, but also the powers of impeachment should also be unified under military power. The so-called military state is actually a system and not empty talk. No matter how civilized a country is, if it cannot be organized into a military state when it is beset by internal turmoil and external troubles, the country will surely perish. The Song and Ming dynasties are examples of this. As for when the foundation of the country has been established, order has been established, and worries have been resolved, the so-called "success is celebrated, and governance is established with rituals," any martial country should at this time engage in the promotion of education and arts, the cultivation of rituals and music, and the protection of the people's freedom. If a country specializes in bravery and aggression, even if its culture is supreme and its people are strong, it will ultimately harm itself. Germany ten years ago is an example of this. From a theoretical point of view, the origin of martial force comes from mankind's upward energy and the need to compete for survival. Even the individual's efforts to be cautious and self-disciplined, with a strong will to eliminate bad habits, promote self-striving efforts, and maintain the health of body and mind so that they are not infringed and transferred by the environment, are all sources of martial spirit. The practice of skills is just a tool. However, a person's physiology and psychology cannot always maintain this state of tension. Harmonizing it with nature, enjoying it with songs, music, and arts, regulating it with courtesy and humility, tempering it with kindness and peace, and nourishing it with food, clothing, and housing are all cultural. The two are regulated together, and then they become a complete morality. Otherwise, it is not only useless but also harmful. Therefore, from all aspects, the theory of civil-military separation is an incomprehensible prejudice. It is caused by the habit of emphasizing arts and belittling martial arts in the past dynasties, and the destruction of the military system, the decline of military discipline, and the decay of military studies, resulting in a concept of terror. Observing the internal and external environment of China, the more we want peace, the more important martial education becomes. The so-called martial education is not only the form of military education that exists today. The fundamentals of all education should be reformed. First, the bad habit of separating educational scholarship from the nation must be eliminated. Second, the thoughts and behaviors of freedom and laissez-faire must be corrected. Third, education should be based on practicality, so the goal of education should be practical morality, practical knowledge, and practical skills. Fourth, strict training in group life and the cultivation of the ability to act automatically in common life are the foundation of true military education. If the school's policy can be like this, then applying appropriate military education will be effective. Otherwise, it is better to encourage physical education and allow it to develop freely. As for what should be paid attention to in military education, there are more things. I will briefly list the items. First, military officer education must pay attention to the inculcation of politics, economics, common sense, and the cultivation of legal knowledge, so that they will not be political and social illiterates, different from the prejudices of the public. Second, the communication between military academic institutions, educational institutions, and general academic educational institutions. Third, soldier education should also be national education at the same time, and also used as adult literacy education. In order to transform hundreds of thousands of soldiers into people who have received good national education, so as to achieve the goal of good soldiers as a model for good citizens. The above discussion is only a rough outline. For the sake of the reader's reference, I will briefly mention it. As for the details, we will wait for another discussion. (IV) Preserving the inherent morals and skills of the nation. Regarding the Manchu language, writing, and customs as the foundation of the nation. Adding hundreds of thousands of people to hundreds of trillions of people is practically equal to zero, and they still try their best to maintain it, so as not to lose it. This ultimately failed in fact, but its spirit of nation-building is still commendable. In other areas of religion and morality, it displayed the courage to preserve the characteristics of its own race. Religion respected Tibet, but the people's morals were not the same; scholarship revered China, but the people's customs were not assimilated. This was the grand policy of nation-building during the more than 100 years of the Shunzhi, Kangxi, and Yongzheng dynasties. If its inherent culture was slightly higher, the Chinese nation would be assimilated by it. Therefore, the reason why Chinese culture was able to assimilate the Manchus was due to momentum, not the strength of Chinese culture, and even less the strength of the Chinese nation. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen often said that today, Western culture, economy, politics, and military are all stronger than us. The Chinese people must not rest in a dream, assuming that they have the power to not be assimilated by others and to assimilate others. The people of the country should wake up!</p>
<p>Second, education for the Han Chinese and other ethnic groups</p>
<p>The decline of Chinese education and the fall of the school system have been long-standing, but the greatest destruction was the hundred years of the Mongol invasion of China. Not only did education decline, but the national spirit was also lost. The so-called rites, music, and clothing were almost completely gone. Emperor Taizu of Ming arose, expelled the barbarians, and brought back the glory. His contribution to the revival of the nation was enough to surpass the Han and Tang dynasties, which the Zhao and Song dynasties could not match. However, from a cultural point of view, the Ming dynasty was not worth mentioning. Using the eight-legged essay to bind scholars, using the imperial examination to replace schools, treating ministers as prisoners, and weakening the foundation of the country with superficial peace were all the most pitiful aspects of the Ming dynasty's politics and education. Therefore, the spirit of national revival was stifled and never stretched out and developed. The enemy in the north was not destroyed, and the disaster in the east struck again. Internal and external troubles multiplied, and the accumulation of decline collapsed to the point of being irreparable. The Qing dynasty's education for the Han Chinese was based on the Ming dynasty's system. Although at the beginning of its nation-building, it deeply knew the mistakes of the Ming dynasty's educational policy and thought of saving it, it could not fulfill its desire for reform due to the involvement of various greater interests. Therefore, if a nation is not educated by its own people and has autonomous political power, it is impossible to obtain good politics under alien rule. In the early Qing dynasty, although it was in this difficult situation, its nation-building model was still worthy of admiration. It strived to maintain the inherent spirit of honesty, simplicity, martial arts, and courage for the Manchu people, so as not to be influenced by the weak literary style of the Han people, as described in the previous section. Moreover, it cannot be said that the education for the Han Chinese was worse than that of the Ming dynasty. There were several aspects that were most commendable and were the characteristics of the post-Han and Tang dynasties. I will briefly list them.</p>
<p>(1) Establishing the foundation of social morality, with the heart and behavior combined into one. All education was based on this as a criterion. This was the sixteen edicts issued by Emperor Kangxi. If you examine the content of the sixteen edicts in detail, you will find that it organizes China's inherent culture into a most practical system. It embeds the spirit of describing without creating into creation. It makes the educated person's words consistent with their heart and their actions consistent with their use. The receiver and the giver are integrated into one. If the organization of society is sound, then the foundation of the nation will be solid, and the people's lives will be stable. Emperor Yongzheng again abridged these sixteen articles and made them into six articles of twenty-four characters. As a result, the propaganda was easier and the popularization was wider. Then, the most important points related to national political discipline were selected and made into instructions for scholars to restrain the scholars who entered school. Social education and political education are both linked together. Generally speaking, the content of its social education was perfect in China at that time. The spirit of Zhengda Wusi and Guangming Puzhao and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings on the Eight Virtues, which were used to restore the inherent moral intelligence and educate the people, were similar in their intentions. However, the tool used to bind scholars and prevent the Chinese nation from regaining the spirit of self-reliance was actually a recumbent tablet that formed the basis of political education. Compare it with how it taught Manchu scholars, and you will know. Dr. Sun Yat-sen taught the people with the Three Principles of the People, the goal of which was to serve the world, while its goal of binding the world's scholars with the recumbent tablet was to serve one's own interests. The division between public and private intentions is the distinction between educational policies. This is why national self-reliance is necessary.</p>
<p>(2) The officials in charge of education should bear the responsibility of social education in addition to school education. In fact, the system of the Imperial College in the Qing dynasty was nominally in existence but not in reality. The rural schools in the provinces, the so-called universities, middle schools, and primary schools, also had no schools. The use of its educational palace, in addition to presiding over the lesson tests and supervising the scholars, had no education to speak of. If there was any, it was social education. The Qing dynasty's propaganda politics used the officials in charge of education as the main propagandists. The appointment of officials in charge of education also took the achievements of propaganda as a major requirement. The reason why the teachings of the Kangxi and Yongzheng dynasties were able to be so popularized was due to the earnest use of the method of lecturers. In my childhood, I still personally saw the preaching platform in front of the Administration Commission, where an official in court attire and court hat would give an open-air lecture every day. This was the work of an official in charge of education who had not yet received a vacancy. In Hanzhou, where I grew up, there were always street-side platforms for preaching at night, whether in the city or in the countryside. The principle of preaching was based on the sixteen articles and six instructions. After explaining the clauses, they would cite stories to prove them. There were songs and explanations, and they were reasonable and touching. At that time, the education that the common people received was only this, and those who took on the job were the teachers and students of private schools. In the eyes of the general public, preaching the sixteen articles was a great merit. If there was a sick person in the family, they would ask someone to preach; if they were unsuccessful in life, they would ask someone to preach; if there were no children in the family, they would ask someone to preach; if they wanted to cultivate blessed fields, they would ask someone to preach. If there was a clever child in the family and they wanted him to be praised in the village, they would have him preach. A poor scholar who wanted to open a school to attract students would set up a platform for preaching. The popularization of preaching and the belief in the government's teachings reached such a degree that Dr. Sun Yat-sen praised it as a good model for political tutelage and instructed us to pay close attention to it. I also remember the psychology of the people of Guanghan at that time. They respected and loved the sixteen articles and six instructions as much as the Six Classics, and their love even surpassed them. Only for the recumbent tablet that instructed scholars did they have a terrible and frightening demonic thought in their unconsciousness. I often heard my elders warn, "If you are not adults and have not entered school, if you read the recumbent tablet, you will definitely be inauspicious." The reason for this is unknown, but the greatness of the subconscious power of the nation can also be seen.</p>
<p>(3) The policies for civilizing barbarians and protecting such small ethnic groups were quite evident in education. Limiting competition in examinations was one of them. The prohibition of stomach loans was most closely related to the motivation to protect the Yi people of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Taiwan. Practically speaking, without rewards and protection for such uncivilized ethnic groups, the extinction of the bloodline would be easy, let alone the failure of cultural competition. As for the preferential treatment of scholars from distant dependencies, making everyone get what they wanted was a good policy of dealing with small things with great care. For example, the students sent by Ryukyu who studied at the Imperial College received a monthly stipend and seasonal clothing. The winter clothes were fox fur, and the hats were sable. Each student was also allowed to bring three followers, and they were also provided with fire and food. In winter, each person was given a sheepskin coat, and in summer, they were given a kudzu cloth. This was really the way that should be done for people from afar, not just for political purposes.</p>
<p>The above is a mention of the points that are particularly important. There are many other things that can be learned from. For example, the editing and sorting of various documents, the collection and printing of books, and the encouragement of academies and charity schools</p>

<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Ever since Darwin propounded his theory of evolution, it has been known that the so-called "human," revered as the spirit of all things, is merely evolved from monkeys. This simultaneously proved that the legends of Nüwa mending the heavens and crafting the original human race, male and female, are pure mythology and fallacy. However, some things previously considered mythological and fallacious have now become reality. For example, flight, which was mentioned in Greek myths as someone making wax wings and flying into the sky, was naturally the fantasy of writers at the time. But now, the reality of "flying into the sky" is not considered a myth by anyone and has simply become "common knowledge." Therefore, what was considered mysterious in ancient times has, thousands of years later, become common knowledge to children. So, what is now considered mysterious, absurd, and impossible may become a fact, and even a commonplace fact, in ten or a hundred years. Because humans, ever since they rebelled against their ancestors, the monkeys, and conquered the floods and beasts of nature, have done as they pleased on Earth. To avoid cold and heat, and to maintain propriety, there are clothing, culture, and artifacts. To resist wild animals and foreign tribes, weapons and barriers were created. The earliest clothing, weapons, and dwellings were all taken from nature. Thereafter, as human intelligence gradually evolved, they progressed from utilizing natural objects to creating artificial objects, which is the origin of science. For example, the creation of the compass to avoid getting lost, and the manufacture of gunpowder to facilitate attacking beasts and foreign tribes from a distance, these are the beginnings of science. Since Watt invented steam power from boiling water, all tasks that previously relied entirely on human and animal power were replaced by steam engines. Since Edison invented the electric light, the dark world that previously relied solely on vegetable and kerosene for lighting was transformed, and cities became bright lands illuminated by electric lights. Artificial electricity can not only emit light but also possesses tremendous power, so all engines use electricity. Since Marconi invented wireless radio, even if thousands of miles away, people can communicate with each other as if sitting in the same room. These are all recent facts, which were undreamt of in ancient times, and even if they were conceived, they were considered myths or fantasies. The way we view the future is how the ancients viewed the present. The cultural history of humanity is one of progress, not regression. Although major wars, severe epidemics, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes can destroy humanity and human culture, humanity always has an enterprising and competitive spirit, as well as curiosity, so unless the world is completely destroyed, humanity will always move forward, and human culture will not regress. Therefore, in ten or a hundred years, there will certainly be amazing inventions. Recently, although our country has suffered from natural and man-made disasters, and the people are struggling to survive, it seems that there is no talk of science. But was Russia not full of starving people and beset by internal and external troubles more than a decade ago? However, once their politics were on track, they used science to improve everything. Now, the first Five-Year Plan has been completed, and the second Five-Year Plan has begun. Furthermore, they not only utilize existing science but also encourage invention. Truly, there is a sense of [vitality and surpassing the predecessors]. Even Britain and America, which have always prided themselves on being civilized and enlightened, have to take notice. Who knows, in ten or several decades, China may not become even more [vigorous and surpass the predecessors]? At the end of this twenty-second year since the birth of the Republic of China, with long nights and many dreams, I have had some thoughts and have picked up my pen to write such a dream, which can also be said to be the reality of a century hence. Those who are passionate about science can treat it as a stimulant, while those with leisure can read it as an absurd myth or a wild dream. To get back to the topic, I will divide this dream into several sections and record it randomly below…</p>
<p>II. Artificial Life a Century Hence</p>
<p>In recent years, the progress of science has been rapid. The ingenuity of human power has been astonishing. So, in the near future, I am afraid that anything can be made artificially. What is now considered the most mysterious and most difficult to create artificially is [human life]. But artificial life—people creating people with life—will certainly be realized one day. Now, judging by general common sense, it is assumed that it is not difficult to manufacture inanimate objects artificially, but it is impossible to manufacture living things. But we can further explore what the difference is between [living things] and [inanimate objects]? The lowest form of protoplasm of [living things] can be said to have absolutely no difference from the colloid of inanimate objects. The elements of the human body, as a result of chemical analysis by chemists, are only a dozen or so elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, calcium, iron, and phosphorus. The reason why [inanimate objects] are [inanimate objects] is also just something composed of these elements. The only difference is that the methods of organizing the basic substances are different from each other. [Inanimate objects] have a simple composition, while [living things] have a complex organization. Especially humans, have a very complete organization and structure. The life of living things—life phenomena—is just one of the natural phenomena. [Since life is only a natural phenomenon, then this life is naturally governed by the laws of nature. Chemistry is the exploration of the laws of nature, so as long as chemistry advances, the problem of [life] can be easily solved. Because the origin of life is probably based on inorganic matter, these inorganic substances gradually become complex compounds through mutual chemical reactions. Furthermore, these complex compounds combine with each other to form extremely complex organisms [humans]. This seems to be the same as when experimenting in chemistry, combining various elements to create a complex compound. Therefore, if we can artificially manufacture these organic substances that form living production bodies, and at the same time find out the method of their combination, then artificial life is definitely not impossible. Now, the foundations of life chemistry—proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, endocrine (Hormone note: liquids secreted from the thymus, thyroid, and gonads of the human body)—can all be manufactured artificially. Thereafter, as long as we gradually study the relationships and effects between these substances, then [artificial life] is probably not a pie in the sky. Once artificial life is successful, then the population can be统, and the troubles of birth control and encouraging childbirth can be avoided. This world may have no more competition and slaughter, and everyone will live in peace and harmony, and there will be another world.</p>
<p>III. Transportation a Century Hence</p>
<p>(A) Maritime Transportation: Human affairs are becoming increasingly complex, and the transportation industry is also advancing rapidly. From sailing ships to steamships, there has already been a major advancement in navigation safety and speed. The world's largest commercial ship now has a deadweight of 59,957 tons. The French commercial ship [Normandie], which is about to be launched, is 1,028 feet long and has a deadweight of 75,000 tons. All the joint force decorations are also above other ships. It can be called the world's first commercial ship. From Watt's invention of steam to the present, it has only been more than 130 years, and there has already been such rapid progress. So, how ships will progress in the next century can be imagined. The existing ships have [streamlined] shapes below the waterline to reduce water resistance and facilitate forward movement. However, the upper part of the ship is subject to air resistance, which is generally not taken into account. Although the resistance of air is not as great as that of water, it still has considerable resistance. Therefore, to increase the speed, the upper body of the ship must also be changed to a [streamlined] shape, without the uneven changes of the current ships such as the bow and the deckhouse, purely like a swimming fish. As for the engine, although there are already internal combustion engines instead of steam engines, without the annoying smoke, ships in a century will not only not need steam, but internal combustion engines may also become outdated. Moreover, there must be a more ingenious invention of propulsion machinery. This propulsion machine will definitely not need to use natural fuels such as diesel, coal, or kerosene, and will further use artificial fuels, such as using oxygen in the air or water to make liquid fuel. The raw materials for these fuels are truly inexhaustible and can be manufactured in the ship at any time. With the shape changed and the interior novel, the speed will be many times faster than existing ships. To travel around the world will take only a few days. At the same time, to ensure the safety and comfort of passengers, the ship will be extremely large, and the ship will have music rooms, theaters, cinemas, swimming pools, sports fields, zoos, botanical gardens, parks, and all the equipment for eating, drinking, and living on land. Passengers at sea will not be inferior to those on land. There will be no seasickness or the smell of the ship, and they will be in paradise, coming and going to various places.</p>
<p>Submarines, which are now only for military use, will certainly be used for travel at that time. When the weather is clear, travel at sea. When the weather is rainy and snowy, travel underwater, taking this opportunity to browse the wonders of the sea, accompany fish and shrimp and travel in crystal palaces. What is the joy? Others, such as studying marine life, can also use this underwater travel ship to collect fish, shellfish, and seaweed.</p>
<p>(B) Land Transportation: At that time, most of the land transportation will be changed to underground. The land will be full of parks and beautiful pedestrian walkways. After work, people can either take a walk or rest, because in that era, people's working hours will definitely be reduced compared to now, and the time for recreation will be extended. The means of transportation underground will definitely not use the current smoky trains. There must be more lighter and more comfortable inventions. As for communication organs, they will definitely abandon mail and use wireless radio to talk directly. Moreover, this talk is not only to hear the voice but also to see the face. So, even though they are thousands of miles apart, as long as they turn on the machine, they can face each other, talk, laugh, and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>(C) Air Transportation: The current airplanes, except for military use, are not very common for civilian use, and the cost is high, so the general public cannot enjoy the taste of riding the clouds and soaring in the sky. A century later, there may be no distinction between rich and poor, and everyone can use this convenient transportation tool. Not only can they ride it to travel around the world, but they can also ride it to roam another planet. Since the air transportation industry is very developed, then air traffic signals and air traffic patrols must be necessary. The sky is now the world where flying birds soar, and in the future, it will be a place for people to flaunt their power. Moreover, the airplanes at that time must be safer than they are now, and there will be no more of that ear-splitting engine noise. To facilitate group travel, large airplanes will definitely appear. Moreover, there will be airplane fields everywhere, where you can take off and land at will.</p>
<p>IV. Housing a Century Hence</p>
<p>Born as a human, clothing, food, housing, transportation, and entertainment will always be necessary, whether it is a hundred or a thousand years later. It is just that the wheel of time advances, and they change accordingly. The current housing can be said to be all abnormally developed. In large cities, high-rise buildings reach the sky, and buildings line up like combs, while in rural areas, low huts and thatched cottages are sparsely populated. The housing construction a century later will definitely try to correct this defect and distribute it evenly so that everyone can enjoy fresh air and everyone can receive approachable sunlight. Moreover, because land transportation is moved underground, the disturbing sound of car wheels and alarm sounds can be reduced all around. Other entertainment facilities will also change from the current closed indoor entertainment—such as dance halls and casinos—to outdoor games. Moreover, due to the development of facsimile movies (unlike current movies, which can only be projected on the screen, but in space project their sounds and movements), you can see aerial singing and dancing performances in the plaza. Moreover, at that time, human power will be able to be ingeniously夺天工, and the climate can be arbitrarily adjusted, so you will never feel threatened by severe cold or scorching heat.</p>
<p>V. Food a Century Hence</p>
<p>The love of food of our people is world-famous. Every day, three meals are as troublesome as possible, and both time and money are not economical. Recently, in various European and American countries, there are public cafeterias with cheap and good-quality food everywhere. The Soviet Union even has public-run cafeterias. Staff members do not have to worry about firewood, food, oil, or salt. At a certain time, they can go to the cafeteria to get palatable food, which is much more convenient than our current self-catering in each family. But a century later, due to the progress of science and the reduction of natural objects, what we eat may not be the current rice, wheat, vegetables, and meat, but we will apply organic chemistry to manufacture light and palatable synthetic foods. There is no need for the trouble of cooking, nor do you need things like bowls, spoons, cups, and dishes. As long as the protein, vitamins, and water needed by the human body are 配成 pill-like foods, one or two pills per meal will be enough to fill your stomach, which is extremely convenient for busy people.</p>
<p>VI. Clothing a Century Hence</p>
<p>The original purpose of clothing is to avoid cold and heat and to maintain propriety. In the world a century later, as mentioned earlier, due to the progress of science, you can call for clouds and summon rain, and the climate can be artificially adjusted. There is no hot summer and no severe winter. Everyone only needs light clothes and thin skirts. At that time, man-made silk and man-made wool must be more beautiful and charming than the existing ones, and they must be light and soft on the body.</p>
<p>VII. Heat Sources a Century Hence</p>
<p>Since humans broke away from the era of eating raw meat and drinking blood, they have drilled wood to make fire and advocated cooked food. Therefore, fuel has gradually become a necessity for mankind. From wild grass and wood to coal blocks and kerosene, it can be said that the rapid progress of fuel. Today, the discovery of coal mines and kerosene mines has become a necessary task, but coal mines are natural objects and will eventually be exhausted, and their distribution is not uniform. Therefore, fuel has become a particularly important issue. In the future, we may not use natural fuel, but take the sun's love or the earth's heat. This is the utilization of heat sources.</p>
<p>VIII. Future Scientific Weaponry</p>
<p>The antagonism between countries in the international arena has become increasingly acute. All arms reduction conferences and economic conferences have failed. The arms race, building warships, making airplanes, and manufacturing poison gas have become an open secret in various countries. Therefore, World War II will soon come to the world, or there is a possibility of it breaking out in the next one or two years. So I call it future scientific weaponry.</p>
<p>(A) Poison Gas: Poison gas is the most fashionable and cruel weapon in modern warfare. The already invented ones include: fake tear gas (which makes the enemy shed tears and unable to look up), asphyxiant gas (which makes the enemy's breathing blocked), blistering gas and toxic gas (which makes the skin of enemy soldiers ulcerate or become poisoned). In the future, there may be hypnotic anesthetic gas. To take an enemy city, there is no need to attack. Just scatter this gas densely in the enemy's space, and they will fall into a state of sleep. Then, occupy their city and disarm them. It is both滑稽 and not very cruel.</p>
<p>(B) Germ Warfare. Germ warfare is prohibited by international law, but once the battle is in full swing, I am afraid that international law will be equal to waste paper. Therefore, in future wars, it may have a good show of its skills. For example, scattering bacteria such as cholera, black rat plague, and typhoid fever in the sky above enemy cities. These bacteria attach to food or fall into rivers and reservoirs. The result will be that severe epidemics will break out suddenly, losing combat power and surrendering.</p>
<p>(C) Strange Force Lines: Killing with light rays is probably also possible. Scientists in various countries are secretly researching it. For example, ultra-short waves, high-frequency sound waves, high-voltage current wireless radiation, or the use of the radiation force of radium X and super heat ray radiation, or the use of the intersection of two different radiation rays — this intersection has great killing power — etc. These strange force lines can not only kill people but also use it to explode gunpowder, lose magnetism, and stop engines, etc. It also has unexpected effects.</p>
<p>(D) Poisonous Needle Bullets: This is not like the current bullets or bombs. It is a light and automatic weapon containing countless poisonous needles. Anyone who receives this bullet, even if it is only a skin wound, but because the needle end has a crystal of potent poison, will soon die from a state of drunkenness.</p>
<p>(E) Flying Tanks: The so-called flying tanks, the fuselage is made of alloy, which is light and strong. The body weighs from fifty tons to a hundred tons. It only takes twenty-four hours to circle the earth, or even faster than this, which is not unpredictable. Carrying strange force lines, germ bombs, and poisonous needle bullets, it travels back and forth in enemy space, carrying out explosions.</p>
<p>(F) Flying Battleships: Flying battleships can not only fly but also dive underwater, providing current to [non-wake electric torpedoes]. The enemy's ultra-speed torpedoes, therefore, the radio control of the non-wake electric torpedoes can be properly hit.</p>
<p>(G) Winged Torpedoes: This is used on land, but like underwater torpedoes, it is controlled by radio waves. Various explosives can be installed to attack cities at close range without any manpower.</p>
<p>IX. Conclusion</p>
<p>Science creates happiness for mankind and relieves suffering, so everyone hopes that science will progress and truly become omnipotent. But unfortunately, the current science has become a war item. It turns around to poison mankind and eliminate mankind. However, science itself is manipulated by humans. Humans want it to do what it does. It has nothing to do with science. As mentioned earlier, World War II may be just around the corner. This war is a scientific war. It can also be said that it is not a war of human power but a war of intelligence. This future world is terrible and welcome. It all depends on how we work hard.</p>

<p>Puppet Puyi Actually Plots to Relive Old Dreams</p>
<p>Usurping the Title of Emperor of Puppet Manchukuo and Mongolia</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet Puyi had planned to restore the imperial system since he was coerced out of the pass two years ago, with the strong encouragement of a certain country. Fearing international criticism, he first transitioned under the guise of a puppet chief executive. Recently, he has been reliving old dreams and actively pursuing his ambitions. A certain country has sent special agents to Mongolia to incite unrest, enabling Puyi to usurp the title of Emperor of Puppet Manchukuo and Mongolia. His intention to become emperor is entirely aimed at annexing Mongolia. The conspiracy is to bring Mongolia under the control of the puppet organization. The rebel Puyi plans to declare himself emperor on March 1st, as that day is the anniversary of the puppet organization's so-called founding. The regnal year will also be changed at the same time. Preparations are being intensified with the assistance of a certain country. Simultaneously, there are traces of special agents from a certain country throughout Inner Mongolia, engaging in various activities. It is reported that after the Central Government's recent dispatch of personnel to comfort the Mongolian princes, most of them are able to understand the greater good and will not be misled. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The puppet state originally planned to send the puppet Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu to Japan in February next year to discuss the issue of Puyi's coronation. However, after the political conspiracy of key figures in Jilin province was uncovered, the political situation within the region became chaotic. If Zheng were to leave Changchun, the anti-imperial and pro-reform movement would become even more active, and the imperial faction would lose control. Fearing that the imperial movement would be thwarted as a result, Zheng changed his original plan and sent a trusted aide to Japan for negotiations instead. Zheng will remain in Changchun to preside over the Puppet State Policy Review Committee, planning to finalize its so-called national policies by around January 10th. This national policy is related to the content of the second agreement between Japan and the puppet state. Because the new treaty will make the puppet state a protectorate of Japan, the so-called national policy is intended to pacify domestic and foreign opinion. The Japanese and puppet authorities have decided to hold important meetings during this New Year holiday. (31st China United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Hebei Security Brigade is Closely Guarding</p>
<p>Tong Zeguang's Troops Ordered to Suppress</p>
<p>Military Affairs Commission Negotiating with the Japanese Side on Resolving the Liu Issue</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou reports that Liu Guitang's troops plan to move from Kangzhuang to Nankou to sabotage the railway line between PingSui and Guankou. Song Zheyuan telegraphed Zhang Zizhong, commander of the Second Brigade, Tong Zeguang, ordering him to suppress Liu's troops. After receiving the order, Tong led his troops from Longguan on the 30th to suppress the enemy towards Yanqing and Yongning. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military sources report that Liu Guitang's troops are in Erdaoguan, with the bulk of their forces in Dongbaimiao. As the area is desolate and unsuitable for long-term occupation, they plan to move to Changping. The Military Affairs Commission is negotiating with the Japanese side to resolve the issue. There is an understanding regarding dispatching troops to resolve the situation. (31st Dispatch)</p>

Along the way, Liu's troops even posted proclamations of the "Second Army of the East Asia Cooperation Association," claiming that they were ordered to relocate to Yongning and that their mission was to disrupt railway traffic between Nankou and Kangzhuang, absurd claims. Song has dispatched Tong's brigade from Longguan to pursue the rebels towards Yanqing and Yongning. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng said that regarding the takeover of Gubeikou, he had met with Japanese Colonel Nikai and Lieutenant Colonel Kawano, dispatched by the Japanese side, several times in Gubeikou and made some initial progress.

If the negotiations proceed smoothly, the takeover is expected to take place within a month. After negotiating with the Japanese side, he plans to return to Beiping as soon as possible. Because Liu Guitang's rebel army intended to intrude into the Beiping war zone, he went to Huairou, Miyun, and other places to supervise the defense, along with Wei De, the captain of the Second Regiment of the Security Brigade, and the county magistrates and public security chiefs of each county. The various passes of the Great Wall are now adequately defended, and it will be difficult for Liu's troops to intrude. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Weifan, Chief of Staff of the 29th Army, telegraphed Beiping on the 31st, reporting to the relevant authorities on the situation of Liu Guitang's rebel troops' disturbance and requesting them to consult with the Military Affairs Commission to quickly order capable troops to suppress the rebel troops from Yanqing, to prevent the Japanese from taking advantage of the situation. (31st Dispatch)</p>

According to Sun Dequan's report, Xia Ziming of Liu's troops has broken away from Liu and is now stationed in Longmen with about two to three thousand men, completely uncooperative with Liu. Sun Dequan's troops are now stationed in Yanqing, and one regiment of Zhang Tingzhu's troops is stationed in Xincheng in that area. Liu's troops have occupied the old city of Yanqing, and the two armies are only twenty to thirty li apart. Liu himself is in Yongning Town, which borders the war zone, making it difficult to launch an offensive. Therefore, it is difficult to resolve the situation. Sun Dequan, Feng Zhanhai, Zhang Tingzhu, and other troops are surrounding and monitoring the situation. There were no military actions yesterday. A full-scale solution will be launched when they come out to cause trouble again. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province, sent Xiao Zhenying to Nanjing to report to Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek on Liu Guitang's rebellion and the Japanese and puppet encroachment on eastern Chahar.

Its main forces seem to be still entrenched in the Yongning area. As the area of activity of Liu Guitang's army is within the ceasefire agreement line and armed forces are not allowed to operate or be stationed within the agreement line, which is the policy of the Kwantung Army since the establishment of the agreement, the resident military officer in Beiping, in the name of the commander, strongly demanded on the 30th that Liu's army immediately withdraw outside the agreement line.

<p>(Nanjing) Supervisory Committee member Zhou Lisheng went to Hubei to investigate a case and witnessed the Hankou Special Tax Office protecting the transportation and sale of opium, establishing special tax agencies in various places to collect opium taxes.

<p>Remarks by a Member of the Economic Committee</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official from the National Economic Committee said: (1) Although the US cotton and wheat loans were handled by Song Ziwen, the committee has no direct involvement. Large quantities of cotton and wheat have already arrived in Shanghai, and the accounting and sales are handled by the management office established within the Central Bank. The outside world believes that the committee is directly handling the matter, which is not true. (2) The committee is not very clear about how much wheat flour is included in the wheat loans. Shanghai wheat flour merchants requested a suspension of purchases of US wheat flour. Considering the importance of this matter and that it is not related to the existing management of water conservancy, roads, and sanitation, it was specially handed over to the newly hired technical experts for review. The results of the review concluded that borrowing wheat flour would have an impact on domestic flour merchants and that purchasing flour was not necessary. This opinion has been submitted to the Standing Committee for review. (3) The committee's responsibility is to review various construction plans. All kinds of water conservancy, road, and factory plans proposed by central and local agencies are being reviewed by the committee. (4) Apart from the existing organization of the committee, the remaining control committees and offices have not been implemented, and the names have not been decided. According to the committee's knowledge, as of now, not a single penny of the cotton and wheat loans has been used. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<p>French Foreign Minister Issues Declaration on German Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Says the Door to International Fair Disarmament is Still Open</p>
<p>Hopes Germany Will Return to the League of Nations to Seek a Compromise</p>
<p>The Future of the Disarmament Conference Depends on Franco-German Cooperation</p>
<h3 id="e20">Poncet Carries Reply to Berlin <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) This morning, Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour met with the French ambassadors to London, Corbin, and to Berlin, Poncet. Poncet left for Berlin at 6:00 PM this afternoon. Upon arrival, he will formally notify German Chancellor Hitler of France's views on German demands. The main points of the French government's views are contained in a memorandum, which has been handed to Poncet to take with him. Poncet will first meet with Hitler and then deliver the memorandum.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, Paul-Boncour issued a declaration to diplomatic journalists this morning: "Some people are asking whether there will be direct talks between France and Germany. This is something I absolutely cannot understand. What we are doing is preparing for normal diplomatic negotiations through normal diplomatic channels. If this is not direct talks, then what have we been doing for the past few weeks? Or perhaps what people generally mean by direct negotiations refers to surprising diplomatic negotiations. We have always believed that the League of Nations is the best international forum. We sincerely hope that after Poncet conveys France's views to the German government in accordance with the decision of the Council of Ministers, he will be able to convince Germany that the door to fair and universal disarmament under conditions of mutual security is still wide open, and that the possibility of the Disarmament Conference making progress depends entirely on Franco-German cooperation. Therefore, we are delighted to hear the speeches of US President Roosevelt and the declarations of Soviet People's Commissar Molotov and Foreign Commissar Litvinov. When we recently met with British Foreign Secretary Simon and Czech Foreign Minister Benes, we all believed that the League of Nations would be able to overcome the current difficulties. The facts have proven that our views are correct. For example, the policy of concluding non-aggression treaties, we have personally implemented and encouraged other countries to implement. The threatened parts of Europe rely on this policy to organize security guarantees. The policy of non-aggression treaties has been particularly effective between the Soviet Union and its neighbors, and has recently made progress in the Balkans. The path we have taken is very appropriate and should not be changed. What I am saying is a desire, not just a hope. The aforementioned things are enough to encourage us. It is a pity that the tragic news of the death of Romanian Prime Minister Duca has arrived, which is distressing. Duca was a good friend of mine, and I am deeply saddened that a criminal has committed this heinous act. This is not only a tragedy for the Romanian people, but I also deeply regret it." (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Main Points of the Reply</p>
<p>(Paris) French Ambassador to Germany Poncet will carry the French government's reply to the German government when he returns to Berlin next week. The main points are that France hopes Germany will return to the League of Nations, otherwise the disarmament issue must be resolved in Geneva. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour told a Reuters reporter today that he sincerely hopes that the French government's reply to Germany will make the German government understand that the path to general and fair arms reduction is still open. It now depends on Germany and France cooperating in this spirit and giving the League of Nations a new opportunity. Paul-Boncour finally said that when Czech Foreign Minister Benes, British Foreign Secretary Simon, and Foreign Minister Heiman visited Paris recently, they all said that the League of Nations should find a way out of the current difficulties. France expressed its deep sympathy for this statement. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Various Speculations</p>
<p>(London) French Ambassador to Germany Poncet is currently in Paris and is scheduled to return to Berlin on Monday. What kind of answer he will carry to respond to German Chancellor Hitler's proposal for France and Germany to directly negotiate disarmament or the Saar issue is being speculated on in London and other European capitals. There are various speculations, with different opinions. Some German newspapers have said that France will propose utopian disarmament plans, such as destroying military aircraft and establishing an international sky police force. Others have said that France will reject the German proposal. There are some factors in the situation that cannot be ignored, namely the power of the small countries. The various treaties of the Central and Eastern European countries greatly demonstrate their unity. King Alexander recently traveled to the capital of Yugoslavia, aiming to dispel the differences between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. This trip is of great benefit to the combination of small European countries. Small countries are extremely opposed to Italy's proposed revision of the purpose and organization of the League of Nations, and France's attitude towards this has become stronger since the Czech Foreign Minister's visit to Paris. However, although the Czech Republic is very afraid of the National Socialist Party, Yugoslavia and Romania are quite friendly to the National Socialist Party. Poland and Germany are even closer. The two countries recently concluded a treaty that does not use war as a tool to resolve disputes, which is also a cause for concern for France. The activities of Foreign Minister Heiman in Paris are currently attracting much attention from various parties. This country supports the League of Nations, but believes that if the Disarmament Conference is resumed before France and Germany directly negotiate and eliminate all kinds of difficulties, it will only lead to failure. Belgium also believes that if Hitler's proposal for prescribed armaments fails, it would be dangerous for countries to set up their own armaments, regardless of the amount. However, the French feel that Germany's proposal is just to rearm itself. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Production to Increase Two and a Half Times Again</p>
<p>Nine Thousand Miles of New Railroads to Be Added</p>
<p>Efforts to Reduce Illiteracy Nationwide</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russia's Second Five-Year Plan was announced today. If implemented, it will make the country a formidable rival to its strongest neighbors. It stipulates that by the end of 1937, production will increase by two and a half times compared to the end of the First Five-Year Plan in 1932. Compared to pre-war levels, this represents an increase of more than nine times. The plan also includes the construction of 9,000 miles of new railways, doubling agricultural production, increasing automobile production by 830 percent, and completing projects such as the Volga-Don Canal within these five years. Since the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1917, Soviet Russia has been striving to reduce illiteracy. This effort will now be expanded on a larger scale, with the hope that by the time the Second Five-Year Plan is completed in 1937, the number of students nationwide will increase by 50 percent.

<p>Plotting Began a Week Ago</p>
<p>Two Accomplices Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>◎Rome: The assassin of Prime Minister Duca, Constantin Ieniştea, who committed the act at the Sinaia train station yesterday, was escorted to the capital by police today. Photographers scrambled to capture his image. Ieniştea showed no remorse and said with a smile that assassinating Duca was his duty and that others would be assassinated as well. Ieniştea accused Duca of selling out to foreigners and obeying the dictates of the Kui-chu Assembly to disband the "Iron Guard." He also claimed that he and his accomplices had been planning to kill Duca for a week and finally seized the opportunity at the train station. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>◎Rome: It is now known that the assassination was decided after the disbandment of the Iron Guard. The group imitated the methods of the Macedonian terrorist party, forming a core group of five members to carry out terrorist acts. The assassination of Prime Minister Duca was decided by this core group through a vote. One of the assassin's accomplices was arrested near Comarnic, outside Sinaia. Another accomplice was arrested on a train to Bucharest from Ploiești. A corpse with gunshot wounds was found near Miercurea Ciuc. According to a Hungarian newspaper, it is the body of Iron Guard leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, but well-informed sources deny this. Today, the judicial department ordered the assassin to re-enact the assassination. Rumors circulated that Prime Minister Duca's brother-in-law shot the assassin, but the L'Indépendance Roumaine newspaper has denied this. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>●Rome: A State Council meeting was held today to discuss the aftermath of Prime Minister Duca's assassination. It was decided that all public employees, clergy, and schoolteachers affiliated with terrorist political groups would be dismissed. The Ministers of Interior and Justice were also tasked with drafting special laws to protect the state. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>●Rome: Because the National Party is trying to stir up trouble amid public unrest, the Romanian government is taking strict measures to prevent it. Today, the cabinet decided to impose martial law nationwide, censor news and telegrams, and issue a proclamation to the people stating that the government is determined to maintain national security and order by all possible means. (30th National News dispatch)</p>
<p>Martial Law Declared in Capital: Martial law was declared today in the Romanian capital, university areas, and major cities near the border. Newspapers must submit to censorship. Patrols are present on Bucharest's main streets, but no disturbances have occurred. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Condolences Pour In From Various Countries: Condolences are pouring in from various countries. German Chancellor Hitler and Foreign Minister Neurath expressed their condolences to the Romanian government on behalf of the government. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol also sent the following telegram to the State Department: "I am deeply saddened by the tragic news. With the passing of Prime Minister Duca, Romania has lost a prominent statesman, and the League of Nations has lost a loyal supporter. I extend my condolences to the Romanian government on behalf of myself and the entire Secretariat." (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>State Funeral to Be Held Today: The remains of the late Prime Minister Duca were placed in a coffin at the Peleş Castle last night. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, the entire cabinet personally carried the coffin onto a gun carriage and proceeded towards the Athenaeum. Two hundred thousand people followed. The coffin was placed in the Athenaeum, where the public was allowed to pay their respects. The state funeral for Duca is scheduled for Tuesday, with King Carol II also attending. Duca's remains will be buried in his hometown of Răcari, in accordance with his will. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Plotting for Monarchical Dictatorship: (London) The assassination of Romanian Prime Minister Duca is an unprecedented political assassination in Romania in decades. The state of unrest in Romania is evident. Intellectuals with nothing to do are forced into political fanaticism. Assassination is a common occurrence in other countries, but it is unheard of in Romania. Those familiar with the situation in Eastern Europe believe that Duca's death was purely the result of the National Socialist movement funded by Berlin. The selection of the next prime minister is a problem. Among the Liberals, only Brătianu is qualified, but he is disliked in Romania. Foreign Minister Titulescu may have a chance, but he has no party affiliation and is best suited for handling diplomacy. It is likely that the Romanian King and his confidants, who have long controlled Romanian politics, will eventually openly implement a monarchical dictatorship. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>France and Poland Lose a Good Friend: (Paris) The French political world has expressed shock and grief over the assassination of Romanian Prime Minister Duca and praised him as a true friend of France during his lifetime. Duca was the initiator of the Franco-Romanian alliance treaty. Several newspapers criticized the policies of the Romanian King, saying that the weakness of the Romanian government was the cause of this. All newspapers believe that the overall situation in Romania is now very critical and predict that this assassination will have significant consequences. (30th National News dispatch)</p>
<p>●Warsaw: Polish newspapers unanimously lamented the assassination of Romanian Prime Minister Duca and called Duca a sincere friend of Poland, stating that he always advocated for the Polish-Romanian alliance, viewing it as the most solid foundation of Romanian foreign policy.

<p>American Chemistry Professor Creates Strange Theory</p>
<p>Night Can Become Day</p>
<p>Using Quartz Tubes to Surround the Earth</p>
<p>To Allow Sunlight to Transmit Unimpeded</p>
<p>▲Boston dispatch: Professor Sherman, a chemistry professor at the University of Pittsburgh, recently published a strange theory, saying that surrounding the Earth with transparent and purified quartz tubes could allow sunlight from the East to be transmitted through the tubes to the Western Hemisphere, giving the Americas 24 hours of continuous daylight. He also said that using this same method could transmit the heat of the equator to the two ice poles, warming the frigid climate. He made an S-shaped tube of transparent and purified quartz. The experiment showed that sunlight could enter at one end and exit at the other without being obstructed by the curvature of the tube. From this, he surmised that if a large amount of quartz was laid on the ground, running east-west, the sunlight from the daytime hemisphere could be sent to the nighttime hemisphere. If running north-south, the polar climate could be warmed. However, the cost of this material is quite high, so it is not easy to succeed. But the sand on the beach is mostly composed of quartz particles, so it is hoped that a large amount can be purified and then made into quartz tubes, so the cost may not be much more expensive than glass.

Rebels also attacked Paso de los Toros, but were defeated by government troops. The rebel leader's nephew, Palma, was killed in action. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>If Something Happens in the Pacific</p>
<p>Japan Is Most Afraid of Air Raids</p>
<p>The Small Land Area Makes Air Defense Difficult</p>
<p>Important Cities All Depend on the Coast</p>
<p>Buildings Are Also Prone to Combustion</p>
<p>Disadvantageous Strategic Position Against the US and Russia</p>
<p>▲The World News Agency reports that a Japanese army major general recently wrote an article on the aerial threat to Japan, which is summarized as follows: Japan's land is small and its terrain is long and narrow, making air defense extremely difficult. If Japan once relinquishes control of the Pacific Ocean to the enemy, it will inevitably suffer a fatal blow. It is unlikely that we can launch a deadly attack across the Pacific against the United States. It is also extremely difficult to launch a deadly air raid against China because China's territory is also extremely vast. As for Soviet Russia, Siberia is a vast and sparsely populated area, so no matter how much bombing is done, it will not cause any significant damage. On the contrary, what will happen if Japan is subjected to bombing from China or Vladivostok? Japan's important cities are almost all located on the coast and are filled with highly flammable buildings. If Tokyo and Yokohama are subjected to air raids, the severity of the damage is self-evident. As mentioned above, Japan's strategic position is actually disadvantageous only with respect to the United States. Therefore, in this day and age of rapidly evolving aircraft, the US will inevitably use air power as its primary means of dealing with Japan. The advancement of American civil aviation can be said to be the best in the world. For this reason, in the event of a crisis, civilian aircraft can be converted into military aircraft within hours.</p>
<p>Threat From the Aleutian Islands</p>
<p>Furthermore, the United States is working very hard to develop aviation in the Alaska region. This is actually the first step for the US Air Force to advance from the Aleutian Islands via Kamchatka to attack Japan. Although the Aleutian Islands used to be known as the "Devil's Sea" with frequent heavy fog, making it difficult to fly in formation, recent advances in aviation technology, such as the use of radio telephones and reliance on radio waves for navigation, make it possible to fly safely even in fog and darkness. Therefore, our idea of considering this area a safe zone is no longer applicable. The safety of this area has become a thing of the past.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Threat From the South Pacific <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Next, with regard to the South, according to recent information, the United States has established airports in the Atlantic Ocean to prepare for the free transport of aircraft. Based on this, the air route from Honolulu via the South Pacific mandated islands to Manila and then to mainland China will soon be realized. The current major American aircraft transport company, "Pan American Aviation Transportation Company," which transports passengers from Alaska across the United States to Central and South America, is attempting to cross the Pacific to reach mainland China. The test flight from Shanghai via Hong Kong to Manila was completed last spring. If aerial transport across the Pacific is completed, the United States will also use the power of aircraft to put pressure on Japan from that direction.</p>
<p>Threat of the Large Airship Doctrine</p>
<p>Finally, I will describe the United States' airships. Although the belief in airships suffered a temporary blow after the Akron crashed, the doctrine of air superiority quickly rose again. Currently, they are attempting to build a sister ship to the last remaining Macon. Not only that, the United States is taking advantage of Japan's weakness in not having airships and is attempting to use the large airship doctrine to play an active role in future Pacific battles. The threat of large airships lies in their great range. For example, an airship could attack Japan from Honolulu, bomb various places along the coast at will, and then leisurely fly back to Honolulu. The aircraft can load over two hundred people, if those two hundred were replaced with bombs, one can imagine the amount of bombs it can carry, especially the advantage of a large airship, as long as it does not encounter accidental storms, it has the ability to break through the vast ocean in one breath, which can be proved by the Pacific crossing of the Graf Zeppelin a few years ago.</p>
<p>Originally, the purpose of airships was to use their long range for searching the Pacific, but recently, their purpose has gradually progressed to reconnaissance, and further to bombing. In good weather and during the day, we can shoot down the airship with fighter planes due to its slow speed, but at night and in bad weather, it is when the airship exerts its power, the Japanese are exposed to a terrifying threat.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Threat From China <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>After describing the situation in the Eastern Pacific, let us turn our attention to China. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, China has suffered greatly from the Japanese Air Force, and the idea of building an air force has surged among the government and the people. Currently, they are working hard to promote civil aviation, build an air force, and train pilots, and are trying to build an air force of 1,500 aircraft by 1936. This plan will be completed with the help of the United States Air Force with the help of close ties with the United States. It is rumored that several dozen fighter jets arrived in Nanjing in the spring of 1933, and more will be transported successively. The flight school in Hangzhou is under the guidance of American officers, and not only is it urgently training Chinese drivers, but it is also rumored that under a secret Sino-American aviation agreement, China plans to set up air bases along the Yangtze River in Haizhou (between Qingdao and Shanghai) and Wenzhou (southern coast of Zhejiang Province) for the purpose of attacking Japan, and that in the event of an emergency, these bases will be loaned to the United States. This has shocked Japan for a while. From Shanghai to Kyushu is about 900 kilometers. Using Wenzhou, Hangzhou, and Haizhou as bases, the advanced long-range bombers of the United States Air Force can carry out air strikes on Japan, and the strategic points in the North Kyushu area, which is the Japanese wartime industrial zone, Sasebo Naval Port, and Chinhae Bay in southern Korea, Nagasaki, and the Kanmon Strait will all suffer heavy bombing. According to some information, the Chinese Air Force plans to build more seaplanes, the purpose of which is to fly freely in the East China Sea and attack Japan. Currently, the Chinese Air Force has about 300 to 400 aircraft, but under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, all facilities are being used to restore national power, strengthen military preparations, especially the air force, and we must not underestimate it. We must be vigilant and prepare for the worst. Finally, there is one thing that must be said about China, and that is the Guangdong military government. The Guangdong military government is very close to the American-controlled Philippine Islands and has close relations, and the United States is very supportive of the Guangdong military government. Currently, the air force instructors of the Guangdong military government include a dozen American officers and lower-ranking officers who are responsible for the construction of the Guangdong military government's air force. By 1936, they plan to complete about 300 aircraft. From this point of view, in certain circumstances, the Philippines and the Guangdong army will undoubtedly act in an organic way to confront Japan. Especially when a Japanese-American war breaks out, this situation will undoubtedly be revealed. Therefore, while we are not deeply afraid of the Chinese army, we cannot but feel an unexpected threat from its air force.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Threat From the Soviet Union <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Since the Manchurian Incident, the Soviet Union has continuously increased its troops in northern Manchuria and strengthened its defenses, and the area to which it has devoted the most effort is the air force. The Soviet Air Force currently has 300 to 400 aircraft dispatched to the Far East. Although the bases are scattered everywhere, the main force is in Vladivostok, Nikolayevsk, Spassk, etc. in Primorsky Krai. It is said that there are 30 to 40 super-heavy bombers with a capacity of 7 tons near Vladivostok, and their range is 2,500 kilometers. From Vladivostok to Tokyo is about 1,200 kilometers, to Tsuruga is about 900 kilometers, and to Niigata is about 830 kilometers. If war breaks out, they can leisurely fly back after carrying out indiscriminate bombing, the commander of the Soviet Air Force once said that;</p>
<p>"If Japan wants to bomb Vladivostok, let them bomb it. I will immediately bomb Tokyo and Yokohama with bombers. In this case, it is obvious who will suffer a fatal loss,".</p>
<p>From a practical strategic point of view, this statement is true. Japan will suffer a fatal injury, while the Soviet Union will not feel any deep pain. Moreover, the commander of the Soviet Air Force is an extremely capable person, known for his courageous use of air power, and can arrive from European Russia to the Far East in a few days. Currently, the Soviet Air Force has about 25,000 aircraft (1933). If a Japanese-Russian war unfortunately breaks out, assuming that the Russian side uses two-thirds of them to deal with us, that would reach about 16,000 aircraft, even if half of them come to deal with us, that would reach 12,200 aircraft, and among them are excellent heavy bombers. From the above, in 1935 and 1936, the Empire's air will be threatened by attacks from all sides. How should we engage in offensive air preparations based on the principle of air defense to eliminate this threat?</p>

<p>Move From London to Moscow</p>
<p>(London) According to yesterday's news, the Anglo-Russian trade negotiations, which have been going on for several months, have been moved to Moscow, where British Ambassador to Russia Sir Esmond Ovey and Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov will handle them. These negotiations have been slow recently due to Litvinov's visits to the United States and Italy, but it is expected that there will be good progress soon. One of the most difficult issues to resolve is the British government's demand for compensation for the nationalized assets of the Lena Goldfields Company. The company originally demanded £14 million in compensation, but is now willing to reduce it to around £3 million. However, the Soviet Union is only willing to settle the matter with £1 million. Another issue that is also difficult to resolve is the article of the Ottawa Agreement, which stipulates that the United Kingdom must prohibit the import of goods from countries that give subsidies to dump goods and break international prices.

<p>Collides With Radio Mast</p>
<p>Ten Passengers Killed</p>
<p>●Brussels: Today, British Imperial Airways' plane Apollo crashed and caught fire in Ruiselede, killing all ten people on board, including one woman. The Apollo was traveling between Cologne, Brussels, and London. This time, it was returning to London when it suddenly suffered an unfortunate incident. The plane collided with a 300-foot-high radio mast in heavy fog, causing it to crash and catch fire. The time was 1:05 PM. The radio mast was also destroyed. In March of this year, British Imperial Airways' plane City of Liverpool crashed in Dixmude, killing 15 people. This is the second such tragedy. Although the staff of the Ruiselede radio station tried to rescue the people trapped in the burning plane, they were unable to do so due to the intensity of the fire. A total of ten people were burned to death, including the pilot, radio operator, and eight passengers. The bodies were charred beyond recognition. After hearing the news, the London Imperial Airways immediately sent personnel to investigate and issued a statement saying that the accident was purely due to the plane hitting the radio mast in heavy fog. Most of the victims were British, but one was Polish, an employee of the Polish Rubber Company.</p>
<p>▲Another dispatch: The staff of the radio station who tried to rescue the people in the Apollo were also nearly burned to death. When the plane landed, several staff members rushed to the rescue. Just as they were dismantling the plane to rescue the people, the fuel tank suddenly exploded, and flames erupted. The rescuers were all burned and had to retreat quickly to take care of their wounds. One person's face was burned and has been hospitalized for treatment. The lights of the radio mast were obscured by the fog, and the pilot was unable to see them, causing the tragedy. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e61">Japan's Opium Monopoly Policy in Manchuria <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Speech by Mr. Fuller at the League of Nations</p>
<p>Condemns Japan's Violation of International Morality</p>
<p>During the recent meeting of the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee in Geneva, Mr. Fuller, the US representative, strongly attacked the opium monopoly policy implemented by Japan in the three eastern provinces of China, calling it a violation of the international treaty on the joint control of narcotics. This Japanese behavior, which violates international morality, has a profound impact on our country and the international efforts to eradicate drug abuse. The full text of Mr. Fuller's personally revised speech is translated as follows:</p>
<p>[The United States observes with great astonishment the recent developments in narcotics in the Far East (especially in the three eastern provinces of China). Therefore, I take this opportunity to raise several points related to it to call the Committee's attention and ask the Committee to consider this development in detail and make it fully public. Because the duty of the Committee is to supervise the implementation of the current treaties on opium and narcotics, this work is particularly important at the moment. Because the problem seems to contain cunning behavior to circumvent existing treaties and will undermine the current international management of narcotic drugs.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to state is the opium monopoly system currently implemented in Manchuria and Jehol, which violates Chinese law. The implementation of this system can be described as the only largest illegal business of narcotics in history. At the same time, I would also like to mention the recent attempts to help this business by designing to circumvent the existing treaties on narcotic drugs.</p>
<p>Regarding the nature of this facility, we should examine it based on facts.</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned opium monopoly system, its purpose is to expand the smoking of opium. If we carefully examine the various regulations promulgated by it, it will be sufficient to understand. In addition, there are many other situations that can prove this purpose. However, there is no adequate evidence to use the expected benefits of implementing the opium monopoly system as collateral for loans. If someone borrows money and uses a certain designated benefit as a guarantee, then they have an obligation to increase the benefit as much as possible at any time. This theory has been implemented in Manchuria. The Manchurian authorities, in order to promote their opium business, actively use the latest advertising techniques, that is, they print beautiful poppy patterns on the currency commonly used by the local people. This will keep the concept of opium permanently in the minds of the people. We must also pay attention to the economic issues contained in the implementation of the opium monopoly system. Now, if we examine the budget set by Manchuria ending June 30, 1934, we can get a considerable understanding of the opium monopoly implemented by Manchuria that I mentioned. In that budget, the estimated profit from the implementation of the opium monopoly is 98,282,46 yuan, and the profit from the previous year was 5,000,000 yuan. As for the total business volume of implementing the opium monopoly, it is estimated to be 32,893,394 yuan, of which 17,851,885 yuan is the estimated value of opium. The above numbers are not small, but according to reliable sources, the estimation of this number is still very low, not too high.</p>
<p>When we examine the new form of public sale of opium in Manchuria and Jehol, the question of the source of opium should naturally be considered. One of their planned sources is the opium trade with Persia. This proposal was sent to the members at the end of the last Opium Advisory Committee. In addition, there is another source, which is to encourage the planting of opium in Manchuria, Jehol, and other places.</p>
<p>Regarding the development of Persian opium imports into Manchuria, please refer to the documents distributed at the end of the last committee meeting. The documents clearly record that a certain European company, because of its admiration for the benefits of the opium trade, is willing to participate in the Persian opium trade in the three eastern provinces, but requires that the ships transporting opium from the Persian Gulf to Manchuria do not have to restrict direct access to Niuzhuang and must not stop at various ports along the way. I think you should also recall the chairman of the committee's reply, which was very appropriate. The reply stated that the handling of the proposed problem is beyond the scope of the committee's power. Since the committee's responsibility is to supervise the implementation of various treaties on opium and narcotic drugs, it must not change its position and instead help others evade the responsibility of the treaty. However, the above-mentioned request of the European company clearly attempts to evade the responsibility of the treaty. Not only that, but when the advisory committee attached to the League of Nations General Assembly discussed the Sino-Japanese conflict, it proposed another attempt to circumvent the treaty in another way. It proposed to require recognition of the opium and narcotic import permits issued by the temporary Manchurian authorities currently under military occupation. I heard that this plan was proposed in the advisory committee discussing the Sino-Japanese conflict. According to this plan, the permits issued by the Manchurian authorities to allow opium to be imported into the three eastern provinces of China should be regarded as permits issued by a formal government. Its theory is completely based on the 1925 Geneva Convention and ignores the Hague Convention, the foundation of the various anti-smoking treaties of 1912. Even the Geneva Convention on Anti-Smoking in 1925 failed to pay attention to it, and this agreement is actually for the countries participating in the Hague Convention to discuss how to implement the provisions of that convention. As for the advisory committee discussing the Sino-Japanese conflict, it also failed to discuss the proposal from the perspective of the Hague Convention.</p>
<p>The following is one of the recommendations of the Advisory Committee: In accordance with the 1925 Geneva Convention on Anti-Smoking, League of Nations member states and relevant non-member states shall not grant permission for requests to transport opium or other drugs into the so-called [Manchukuo] region unless the applicant holds an import permit that complies with the above-mentioned convention, declares that the import of these goods into the Manchurian region is not for purposes that violate the above-mentioned convention, and obtains the consent of the requested government. When shipping, an export permit should be attached. Thereafter, the government selling opium must not send a second export permit to [Manchukuo], otherwise, this behavior will be regarded as tantamount to recognizing Manchukuo in fact.</p>
<p>The US government questioned whether the above-mentioned proposal is in compliance with the basic international convention on the management of narcotic drugs (ie, the 1912 Hague Convention). The United States and several other member states of the League of Nations have joined the Hague Convention. The above-mentioned proposal is inconsistent with the Hague Convention. During the period when various countries recognized China's sovereignty over the three eastern provinces, this proposal will result in opium being transported into the three eastern provinces of China, which prohibits the import of opium, in violation of Articles 3 and 15 of the Hague Convention. According to Article 3 of the Convention, the contracting countries shall try to prevent the transport of raw opium into countries that prohibit its import. According to the provisions of Article 15 of the same agreement, all countries with treaty relations with China should assist the Chinese government in taking appropriate measures to prevent opium and drug smuggling within Chinese territory.</p>
<p>In addition, allowing Persian opium to be imported into Manchuria will only increase smoking, and this action, in any case, violates Article 6 of the Hague Convention.</p>
<p>In order to strictly abide by the responsibilities of the Hague Convention, the countries implementing public sales in the Far East colonies have made the following provisions in Article 6 of the Geneva Convention on Anti-Smoking: [Unless the government of the importing country issues an import permit guaranteeing that the imported drugs will not be used for illegal purposes is submitted to the territorial government for inspection and deemed acceptable, the transit of raw opium through one territory to another destination outside that territory shall also be prohibited.] The provisions of the agreement are to prevent the Persian opium trade, and the plan formulated by the Advisory Committee discussing the Sino-Japanese conflict has the meaning of circumventing international treaties. How can we prove that it is appropriate?</p>
<p>We must be frank and selfless and must focus on the facts. What is the motive for facilitating the import of Persian opium into Manchuria? Gentlemen, this is an old story. Its purpose is greed, to seek profit, and the motive is no different from engaging in other illegal trade. I did not think that the members of this advisory committee had carefully considered a certain company's request letter (which was attached to Notification No. 1495) or expressed anxiety for the Manchurian smokers who could not supply their needs, because Jehol was nearby. The purpose of European companies willing to engage in opium transportation between Persia and Niuzhuang is obvious, which is to seek profit.</p>
<p>Now, according to the results of this method, accepting the permits issued by the Manchurian and Jehol authorities is to facilitate the import of Persian and Turkish opium into the three eastern provinces of China. The opium produced in that province contains less morphine. The various laws and regulations promulgated by the province under military occupation today are not only contrary to Chinese inherent laws, but also the management methods are extremely inappropriate, and illegal trafficking has increased unabated. Therefore, importing Persian opium into Manchuria is using Manchuria as the foundation for international private trafficking. This is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>Any facility that facilitates the import of Persian opium into Manchuria is enough to increase the amount of opium in that area for smoking and manufacturing morphine and heroin. Therefore, Manchuria will inevitably become a smuggling center and have the potential to threaten other countries. The problems arising from this situation must be paid attention to by the Opium Advisory Committee and the Central Opium Standing Committee.</p>
<p>Stockpiling opium containing huge amounts of morphine in Manchuria is enough to threaten the United States, violates the provisions of treaties on opium and narcotics, and disregards the dangerous consequences that will inevitably occur in the future. Therefore, I have an obligation to protest against the discussions of the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese disputes regarding [Manchukuo]'s import permits that violate the Hague Convention on Anti-Smoking of 1912. As for the development of local supply sources, according to reports, the Jehol authorities have made more efforts this year to plant and harvest opium than in previous years. In the past, under Chinese management, the tax was 10 yuan per mu, but this year it is only 5 yuan per mu, and various propaganda materials are issued to encourage people to plant opium, and even airplanes are used to distribute leaflets to promote it. It is said that this method has been effective, and the promotion of opium cultivation in Manchuria is also very impressive.</p>
<p>The result of this increase in planting and the development of private opium trafficking is that a large number of new smokers have been produced in Manchuria and Jehol. It is said that due to the sudden increase in production, the supply exceeds the demand, and drug addiction is spreading throughout China and other countries.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that this committee will pay attention to the seriousness of this threat and deal with Manchuria and Jehol in the same way as it has dealt with the situations in Turkey, Eastern Europe, and South China.]</p>

<p>Japan Co-opts Puppets</p>
<p>Puyi Will Ascend the Puppet Throne</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The propaganda that the puppet state will change its system to a Manchurian constitutional monarchy and that Puyi will soon become emperor has been around for a long time, and recently it has gradually become concrete. According to a gentleman who recently came to Beiping from Dalian, the situation is roughly as follows: [At the time of the September 18th Incident, Japan initially did not expect that it could develop to the degree of complexity and seriousness it is today. Therefore, all plans were not predetermined. Later, the situation expanded, and the response became more and more complicated. When the puppet state was created, it was initially not very relieved about the general puppets, so it took a strict monitoring attitude and interfered in everything. Until recently, the situation between Japan and Russia has become increasingly tense, and the international situation has gradually become severe. To win foreign victories, it is necessary to first seek internal security. Aware of the theory that the greater the pressure, the stronger the elasticity, I am deeply afraid that the current oppression of the puppets is too great, and that there may be a backlash in the future, which will be very harmful to the future. In order to win the hearts of the puppets, the policy of monitoring and oppression has been changed, and all treatment has gradually become more favorable, and the actions of the puppets have also gradually become more lenient. Recently, they have secretly encouraged Puyi to restore the throne and form a Manchurian constitutional monarchy, so that they can show internationally that they have no ambition to annex the Northeast. At the same time, they can sell favors to the puppets to fulfill their desire to win them over. Recently, the general puppets have been hypnotized by them, as if drunk and crazy, and are actively carrying out the restoration movement. Zheng Xiaoxu was ordered to cross the sea to the east to negotiate everything with the Japanese. The puppet state's Legislative Yuan is also drafting a constitution in preparation for the system change. The draft constitution has been mostly completed, and Puyi is scheduled to ascend the puppet throne on March 1st and implement the change of era. The Japanese side is observing the international situation for this matter. If no special reason occurs, the strange drama of restoration may be performed. The general puppets have extremely large ambitions and even advocate expanding their power within the customs after the restoration. (30th</p>

<p>Japanese Troops Have Not Yet Withdrawn</p>
<p>Extensive Construction in Luocheng</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The problem of receiving Shanhaiguan has been negotiated for many days, and the so-called receiving is nowhere in sight. We previously invited Ii, the chief of the Japanese military special service agency stationed in Shanhaiguan, to Tianjin to discuss the details of the receiving. After spending several days, there were still no results. It is said that the reason is that the Japanese side forcibly occupied Dongluocheng, and the Japanese people,鉴于 seeing the resurgence of civil war in our country, are hesitant to make a move, and their intentions are unpredictable. Tao Shangming, who is responsible for the negotiations, has now been ordered to go south to make contact. Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, went to Luodong yesterday to inspect the railway affairs and met with Ii at Shanhaiguan. Ii was vague about the problem of receiving Shanhaiguan. Yin Tong was summoned to Beiping and returned to Lü yesterday afternoon at 2:00. According to Yin, this trip to Luodong was to inspect the railway administration and the current situation of transportation and security. When he arrived at Shanhaiguan, he talked to Ii about the problem of receiving Shanhaiguan, but Ii never made any specific statement. The Japanese troops in Shanhaiguan have not yet withdrawn, and the puppet flags are flying in the city. [Manchukuo] notices are everywhere. Looking east from the Deng Station overpass, the Japanese troops are carrying out extensive construction in Dongluocheng, building barracks and opening markets. They are extremely busy. Along the road, the houses of the Railway Bureau occupied by the Japanese troops have mostly not been returned. After negotiations, a part has been given up. The Luoyu Administrative Commissioner's Office originally planned to work in the official residences of the Tangshan military station occupied by the Japanese troops, but the Japanese troops have not yet withdrawn, and the Railway Bureau has allocated other houses for the office to use. During the tenure of the former director Qian Zongze, he had requested the Ministry of Railways to build the Beidaihe seaside to enhance the scenery and increase the income of the Railway Bureau. I also went to inspect the place a few days ago to prepare for future rectification. I have now made another report and submitted it to the Ministry of Railways for approval. (28th)</p>

<h3 id="e65">Inspection Records of Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>By Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Ren An</p>
<p>Miscellany on the Return Journey</p>
<p>After leaving Lihuang, I waited for a train in Lu'an and stayed another night, visiting friends I had met before. I heard three shocking things that I didn't have time to record in my previous letter, so I'm adding them here:</p>
<p>(1) Usurious Loans: Lu'an has suffered from frequent years of war and then disasters, leaving the people impoverished to the extreme. The wealthy in each village, ignorant of the meaning of mutual assistance, always exploit the poor when they borrow money with heavy interest. There is something called "buying paddy in the warehouse," where one yuan is borrowed and the borrower is forced to sell seven斗 of rice. As soon as the new grain enters the market, they immediately demand it. There are also those who borrow two斗 of seeds and demand back one石, or borrow seven and a half升 of rice and demand back four斗 and five升. The types of high interest rates are numerous and vary from place to place. In Mucunbu, there are many grain stores, about twenty or more, which collect and lend grain at high interest rates. The bad customs are getting worse day by day. Taking this year as an example, Juchenghe loaned out 6,000 yuan. The new grain only goes to the ground in two months, and each yuan must pay a five-角 interest. The collection of money and grain is decided at the last minute. Matonghe loaned out 3,000 yuan, and Wenyulong also loaned out 2,000 yuan, while others loaned out several hundred yuan each. Generally, they lend out eight升 and demand fourteen升 in return. The term is at most five or six months, and the high interest rate is as extreme as this. Poor people toil and work hard all year round, but even with all they earn, it is not enough to repay what they owe. Later, the county magistrate discovered this and specially set four borrowing interest rates: (1) Anyone who borrows cash, rice, or grain from others in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933] should handle it in accordance with the following regulations. (2) Those who borrow cash should repay it clearly within this year. The interest rate is 1.6% per month per yuan. (3) Those who borrow rice should convert it into silver dollars according to the price of rice at the time of borrowing. The repayment date and interest rate should be handled in accordance with the previous item. (4) The promissory note and collateral established at the time of borrowing should be invited to the guarantor and returned unconditionally. This announcement was posted in August. Many creditors still disobeyed the order overtly and covertly, and still accepted the money according to the original agreement. However, the debtors were deeply afraid of offending the creditors, which would block the door for borrowing in the coming year, so they voluntarily paid the old amount as before. The number was also quite large.</p>
<p>(2) Dismissing "White Servants": In Lu'an County, the former government had as many as ninety judicial police officers. Each of them also hired several "伙纪" (assistants) to replace them in service, numbering four or five hundred. They usually had no salary, and people called them "white servants." The livelihood of these white servants depended solely on one ticket in hand, relying on extorting as much as possible. It is said that "it is better to extort in the countryside than in the city, and it is more profitable in criminal cases than in civil cases." If a criminal case unfortunately occurs in the countryside, they often lose their family property and reputation, all caused by the extortion of those people who serve warrants (i.e., white servants). When County Magistrate Qin took office, he immediately understood this situation and immediately selected and retained thirty of these white servants, gave them salaries to serve, and dismissed all the rest, numbering four hundred or more. The news spread far and wide, and everyone praised him.</p>
<p>(3) Examining Teachers: There are no fewer than one hundred schools, public and private, in the entire county. The teaching expenses are administered by each district, and most of them are embezzled and misappropriated, so that the school gate has a sign, but there is no sound inside. Some even have no signs. Surveyors only know the name of the school, but do not know its location. As for the content, there are famous higher primary schools, but only one class in the elementary level, or there is one class each in the higher and elementary levels, but the middle level cannot be connected. There are school buildings and equipment, all complete, and a principal has been appointed to receive funds, but when asked about the number of students, they say that they have not yet recruited them. Later, County Magistrate Qin investigated the matter one by one, and then there was the "examination of teachers." The results obtained were indeed too poor. According to the "rectification of education" document submitted by the county government to the education department, "There are those who claim to be history and geography teachers, but do not know who wrote the history books. When asked which province borders southern Anhui, they are even more at a loss for words. Some even say that the Pinghan Railway passes through Anhui Province, and there is a Guangzhou-Hong Kong Railway in Guangdong." These are all anecdotes from this "examination of teachers."</p>
<p>On the way back, a primary school teacher from Hefei wanted to go to Anqing and took the train with me. During the conversation, I learned that the area has always been a rice-producing area, and it is the most prosperous in Huainan. The land is especially concentrated. The entire county is connected, almost all owned by three or five large landlords. In recent years, due to the influence of the times, the landlords not only do not buy land, but even break up and sell their original land, investing in major cities such as Wuhan and Shanghai, and still mostly engage in the business of land. The Duan family, which currently has the most land, also has only about a thousand mu. I also learned that the county's education funding is about 60,000 yuan per year, and the expenditure is 59,700 yuan, leaving a balance of only one or two hundred yuan. The teachers' salaries are very low, with 25 cents per hour for higher primary schools and only 20 cents for elementary schools. They are not allowed to take many class hours. There are provincial Sixth Middle School and Girls' Middle School in the city, which are larger in scale and have many students, so their salaries are also better.</p>
<p>Shucheng has flat land and fertile fields for thousands of miles. It is truly a rice-producing area. The mountains and rivers of Tongcheng are beautiful and lovely. Mount Longmian and Mount Fushan, where Li Gonglin lived in seclusion, are especially famous scenic spots. Fang Bao, Yao Nai, Zhang Tingyu, and other famous scholars of the Qing Dynasty were all born here. They studied ancient texts in depth and were known as the Tongcheng School, which has been highly praised in literary circles. "A place is blessed with talented people," this is what it means.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Anqing, I took a brief tour. Although the place is called the provincial capital and is one of the commercial ports along the Yangtze River, business is not prosperous and the market is deserted. It is said that it is close to Jiujiang and Wuhu, and its business has been taken away. In fact, the terrain is low and humid, which easily leads to floods. When I first went to Jiangxi, it was during the peak of the Yangtze River flooding. When the ship stopped in the middle of the river for a moment, I saw that even the walls of the houses were submerged by the water by two or three feet. The passers-by were waist-deep in water. I thought that only the roads along the river were like that, but now I know that the city is also prone to floods. It is not easy for the market to prosper, and this point cannot be said to be a major cause. Other places, such as the chanting hall, the library, and the tall pagoda known as the "Pagoda King," are all worth a visit.</p>
<p>Later, I took the downstream Jianglun to Shanghai. Few passengers disembarked at each port, while many boarded. Among those who boarded, the majority were refugees. They all bought third-class tickets, but had no money to buy a berth from the tea room. They were all driven to the corridors outside the cabin or on the remaining ground of the ship, where they leaned against their luggage and squatted down. If they encounter a storm or huge waves splashing water on the wheel, they have no way to avoid it. Although the ship supplies two meals of white rice, they are always late, noon is always past noon, and evening is always at night. Everyone is hungry. As soon as the rice basket is carried to them, they all rush forward and scramble to eat. There are no vegetables or soup, only those who call out "Tea!" rush forward. When they heard it, they approached and said that each cup was two copper coins. Those who touched their pockets and did not know a penny, retreated sadly, and there were quite a few people. If the food is not enough, who will ask to add it? They are immediately insulted. When collecting tickets, each person must pay four copper coins (according to this is small money, if you buy a berth or a room ticket, you will pay several yuan). I once saw a woman who was forced to borrow from others and said, "Take the money for me to go back and get it." The tea room slapped her face angrily and left. These passengers who looked like refugees once talked to several people. Their destinations were all in Beijing and Shanghai (in fact, very few got off when they arrived in Nanjing Xiaguan, and more got on). They said "visiting relatives and friends" or "seeking work." The women also readily replied, "Going to work as a servant." Hearing their voices, I couldn't help but think back to the tragic scene of rural collapse that I saw on this trip, and I couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>In the official cabin and room cabin, the sound of mahjong and the sound of smoking, one soft and one hard, echoed each other until they stopped at the Shanghai beach. There is still an annoying thing, which seems to be unique when the wheel docks at various ports. General hawkers sell local specialties, such as "Wuhu Crabs" and "Nanjing Banpeng," which is not surprising. However, there is a kind of bookseller whose clothes are neat and tidy, which is quite commensurate with the noble profession of books. They often break into the cabin with a fan and eloquently sell obscene books and photos such as "Sex History," "The Magic of Lust," and "The Romance of Women," gently persuading them to buy. If they scold them for being unruly, they will come back again and present "Zeng Wenzheng Gong's Family Letters," "Yan's Family Instructions," and "Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian," etc., with a smile on their faces, repeatedly begging them to at least choose one to buy. Those who encounter this really feel like they are crying or laughing. At this time, if the employer accidentally shifts the attention of the items that have been taken care of, the items that are wanted can immediately disappear. The common metaphor wheel is a concession, which proves that it is not deceiving me.</p>
<p>This time, I inspected Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei, and also visited southern Henan and Hanchuan Jingfu. It took five months, and I traveled to more than fifty counties, most of which were recovered red areas and border areas. Although I encountered dangers along the way, I was fortunate to return to Shanghai safely. All the things I saw and heard in various places have been disclosed as much as possible. However, due to road delays and mail errors, I was not able to send them all, or because I was writing in a hotel, limited by time and space, I was unable to say everything, or I did not fully express my meaning. I will collect, organize, and write a small book, so that those who care about the real situation of the four provinces can make a more systematic report, which I think will be welcomed by readers.

<h3 id="e66">Yu Hanmou Presides Over Military Affairs in Southern Jiangxi <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Convened a Military Conference in Dayu</p>
<p>New Arrangements for Defense</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the Fujian Incident occurred in Guangdong Province, in addition to actively deploying defenses in eastern Guangdong, the defense forces in southern Jiangxi have also been mobilized at the same time. Southern Jiangxi is the key hub of the three provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi, which can control the bandits in Jiangxi and Fujian, and can also support the military affairs in northeastern Guangdong. Since the return of Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army, to Guangzhou to assist in military affairs, several weeks have passed. At present, the deployment of defenses in Guangdong Province has been roughly completed, and the war in Fujian and Zhejiang has already broken out. Southern Jiangxi cannot be without a senior official to command and direct. Therefore, Yu specifically accompanied Luo Zicai, the chief of staff of the First Army, and Li Xushi, the director of the political training office, and others on December 20, taking the Guangzhou-Shaoguan train back to the defense. He arrived in Shaoguan at around 3 p.m. that afternoon. The next morning (21), he took the Shaoxiong Highway bus to Nanxiong. That afternoon, he transferred to the Yuxiong Highway and returned to the First Army headquarters in Dayu. On the 25th, Yu immediately summoned the chief officers to hold a military conference to discuss the troop movement issue. Attendees included Li Zhenqiu, commander of the First Division of the Guangdong Army, Ye Zhao, commander of the Second Division, Zhang Da, commander of the Fourth Division, Wang Zanbin, commander of the 44th Gui Army, and Xiang Army divisions Ken Tao Guang, Wang Dongyuan, Wang 　 De, etc. The content of the meeting concerned matters related to the preparation for troop movement. If the troop movement has not yet begun, all pending matters should be concluded. The First Army's previous handling of local construction, education, and production will be temporarily transferred to the local government for takeover. There was also discussion regarding the recruitment and distribution of menial labor before each unit set off. The new deployment of defenses in each unit will be implemented from the first day of the New Year, Republic year 23 [1934]. As for the units of the First Guangdong Army that were previously demobilized, the First Division has been withdrawn to Nankang, part of the Second Division is still temporarily stationed in Anyuan, the Second Independent Brigade has completely returned to Xinfeng, the Fourth Division, which was originally stationed in Xinfeng, has recently returned to Dayu, and the Xiang Army Tao Wang divisions are preparing to take over the stationing in Shangyou Chongyi. Regarding the new plan for deployment, Yu has sent division commanders Li Zhenqiu and Ye Zhao back to the province successively to report to Chen Jitang. Before each unit is demobilized, they will continue to work hard to suppress the remaining bandits. As for the bandit suppression situation in southern Jiangxi, the Wang Ye divisions have repeatedly wiped out bandits near Anyuan. Yu Hanmou has already reported it by telegram, claiming: (1) According to the horse's telegram from Division Commander Wang (Zanbin) on the 　th, relayed from the Ling telegram to Changqiao on the day, according to the sentry's report, there were more than 700 bandits from a false military border guerrilla team hiding in Shanglian, about nine 里 from Anyuan City. Then, at dawn that morning, he led the two battalions of Li Guanghan and Li Benyi to suppress them.</p>
<p>When the bandits saw our officers and soldiers arrive, they first opened fire and swept at our army, and then waved in three ways to charge into the bandit array. After six hours of fighting between the two sides, the bandits could not hold out and fled in chaos towards the front of the car. More than a hundred bandits were killed, the leader of the pseudo-guerrilla team, Da Lang, was captured, more than seventy common bandits surrendered, and twenty-five long and short guns were seized. (2) According to the telegram from Ye Division Commander (Zhao) relayed by Deng Battalion Commander Yangshu, there were more than 800 bandits in Aokou, about ten miles east of Anyuan City, all numbered as the Second Advanced Independent Regiment. They fought with our army at Aoxi for about five hours. Our army fiercely bombarded the bandit crowd with machine guns and cannons. The bandits collapsed and fled towards Laohukeng. More than two hundred bandits were killed and countless were wounded. Five machine guns, one cannon, and one light machine gun were seized from the bandits. There were hundreds of bullets. At the moment, our army is still pursuing and suppressing them, and so on. (December 25)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Guangdong Merchants Relieve Finance <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Commercial Treasury Certificate Issuance Association is Established</p>
<p>Pledge of Products Required to Receive Certificates</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, due to the approaching end of the year in Guangdong Province, business has been declining. Adding the impact of paper money turmoil, the money market has been short of funds. The official departments have announced the restriction of deposit account withdrawals from silver firms and banks. Financial panic has been avoided from expanding. However, this is only a method of maintaining cash. Moreover, this is the end of the year, and it is also the time for the business community to settle accounts. The money market urgently needs to be relieved. In the event of a difficult turnover, all commercial enterprises in the city will inevitably affect each other. Therefore, at the recent economic conference convened by officials and merchants, it was resolved that the Chamber of Commerce would find ways to issue municipal commercial treasury certificates. Merchants who need loans use real estate to mortgage to the Commercial Treasury Certificate Issuance Association to receive certificates to facilitate the turnover. The Commercial Treasury Certificate Issuance Committee was formally established in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on December 26. Representatives of various trade associations attended, including the Silver Industry Association, the Long-Distance Bus Industry Association, the Machinery Association, the Brick and Tile Association, the North and South Brokerage Association, the Printing Association, the Winemaking Industry Association, the Fresh Fruit Goods Industry Association, the Rubber Association, the Chinese and Foreign Grocery Association, the Biscuit Association, the Tobacco Association, the Public 　　 Industry Association, the Pig 　 Association, the Automobile Association, the North River Paper Association, the Leather Industry Association, the Machine-Knitted Shirt and Sock Association, the Velvet Association, the Native Cloth Association, the Rice Industry Association, the Gold Industry Association, the Cotton Yarn Association, etc. from more than seventy groups, and the agency representatives included the governor of the Provincial Bank, the governor of the Municipal Bank, and special inspectors from the Department of Finance, etc. The interim chairman Zhao Jingshan announced the reasons for convening the meeting, roughly saying, "The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a public letter to all parties regarding the matter of organizing the Municipal Commercial 　 Certificate Issuance Committee. A total of 102 public letters were issued. There are currently 82 trade associations that have replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and have designated personnel to attend. There are 68 representatives attending today. After checking the members of the Municipal Commercial Treasury Certificate Issuance Association, 91 are dispatched by each trade association, and 11 are dispatched by each legal group. There is now a sufficient number of people, and the general assembly should be formally established." Then, the inauguration ceremony was held. The chairman read the articles of association and proposed amendments to the articles of issuance of commercial treasury certificates. After deliberation, it was resolved to revise them and submit them to the provincial government for record. Using the double-named ballot method, Zhao Jingshan, Chen Zuoxuan, Chen Weiwen, He Jiping, Feng Dachun, Tan Dichi, Xiong Shaokang, and others were elected as seven standing committee members, and the meeting adjourned. In addition, the Jiangmen Municipal Chamber of Commerce in Xinhui County recently established the Jiangmen Municipal Chamber of Commerce Treasury Certificate Association in accordance with the Organizational Law. The committee members were appointed to be responsible for handling the matter. It was resolved to receive treasury certificates worth 500,000 yuan from the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce Treasury Certificate Issuance Association. The collateral items are limited to real estate in Jiangmen City. (December 27)</p>

<p>Chenjiahang Zhu Surname Robbed</p>
<p>At about 12:00 PM on the 21st, a group of four or five bandits speaking with a local accent suddenly arrived at the home of rural villager Zhong Jianrong of the 31st Regiment of Chenjiahang. They broke down the large gate with stones, swarmed in, and stole items such as shoulder poles and electric wires. One thief watched over the servant Zhou Xinglin while the remaining thieves entered the bedroom of Jianrong's mother, Madam Yang, but found nothing. They then went to Jianrong's bedroom, taking 24 silver dollars from Jianrong's pocket, 40 dollars from the wardrobe, and 6 dollars from inside a shoe, as well as clothing and miscellaneous items, totaling a loss of over 100 dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Grand Occasion of the Agricultural Products Exhibition <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The second agricultural product exhibition, jointly organized by the county's agricultural extension office and the farmer education center, was held at the Tinglin Farmer Education Center starting at 9:00 AM on the 30th.

<p>Youthful Student's Fraud Exposed</p>
<p>Xu Jian'an, a youth from Kaiyuan Township, Fourth District, near Huilong Bridge, is in his twenties and graduated from a certain school, having received a considerable education. Several months ago, he met Xiong Zhaosheng, a student from Jiangxi in the civil engineering department of the Provincial Education Institute's handicraft training class at Sheqiaotou. (Some say Xu was also a student at the institute.) Later, Xiong graduated and was sent back to his native Nanchang. Xu Jian'an, upon learning this, saw an opportunity. He imitated Xiong Zhaosheng's handwriting and sent a letter to Xiong's family, requesting 600 yuan for tuition and 50 yuan for living expenses. Xiong's father noticed discrepancies and quickly sent a letter to President Gao of the Education Institute for inquiry. After investigation, Gao discovered that the letter was written by Xu Jian'an. The previous evening, he sent a letter to County Magistrate Yan, requesting him to send police to bring Xu to the county. Yesterday, Xu was transferred to the county court, where Prosecutor Shen opened the court for interrogation and ordered him to be detained.</p>

<p>Two Bandits Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>In the spring of the 20th year, Yangshuyuan Town in the 14th District of the county was completely looted by a band of bandits, who kidnapped six prominent wealthy residents, including Jing Renzhi, demanding ransom. The provincial government repeatedly ordered the county government to assist in the arrest. Only in March of this year was the bandit den uncovered in Yangshupu, Shanghai, and the ringleaders Yuan Er, Jiang Minsheng, Pan Wangshi, and Pan Huaiyu were apprehended. After detailed interrogation by the county judiciary, except for Pan Huaiyu, whose circumstances were less severe, the others were sentenced to death. After approval from the provincial government, the convicts were brought out on the 30th year, their identities were verified, and they were tied up and taken to the execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>

<p>Fatal Rice-Eating Contest</p>
<p>Yu Jinbiao, a wealthy man from Yuxi District in Nantong, was dining with friends when, in a moment of excitement, they agreed to a rice-eating contest. Yu consumed twenty-four bowls in a row and indeed won. Unexpectedly, in an instant, his abdomen swelled like a drum, and he could not walk. He was carried back, his breathing became faint, and suddenly, with a sneeze, his lower abdomen ruptured, his intestines broke, and he died. The event caused a sensation in the neighborhood and was regarded as a strange story.</p>

<p>Fire in Taichuan Street Kills an Old Woman</p>
<p>The eastern building of the Ruan Wendagong Family Temple in Taichuan Street, consisting of six rooms and four side-buildings, suddenly caught fire at 7:40 PM on the 27th. The flames lit up the sky, the fire was fierce, and it took two hours to extinguish. Not only was the entire building reduced to ashes, but the foolish old woman Zhu, who lived in the building, also perished in the flames. The corpse of the foolish old woman has now been dug out from a corner of the wall, curled up in a ball, completely charred. It is indeed tragic.</p>

<p>Huang, the chief of the third sub-bureau of the Zhaopu Public Security Bureau, was ordered to be transferred to serve as the chief of the Linhai County Public Security Sub-bureau after Zhang Qingze, the county magistrate of this county, was dismissed. Before completing the handover, he was suddenly detained by the current authorities for privately releasing the former county secretary Zuo Chunzheng, who was involved in a case. Some say that Huang had embezzled 400 yuan of public funds, hence this action. A certain member of Huang's staff, A, was also detained at the same time and was sent to the county government for custody yesterday.</p>

<p>Road Workers Riot in the City</p>
<p>There are no fewer than five or six hundred road workers on the Xiangshan Xiangxi dike defense road, mostly from Zhilu and Jiangbei, naturally rude, behaving outrageously, making unreasonable demands along the way, causing considerable disturbance, and arousing public resentment. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 29th) at 3:00 PM, fifty or sixty of the road workers, wanting to demand wages from contractor Shen, armed with wooden sticks, swarmed to the Lin residence on Xianqian Street in the county town (because contractor Shen lived in the Lin residence) to find Shen. At night, the number of road workers suddenly increased to over three hundred, their momentum surging, causing panic. Shen, hearing the news, had already fled, and requested County Magistrate Li Xueren for help. Seeing the serious situation, Li immediately sent the chief inspector to lead all the standing troops to drive the road workers to the Dongdian Temple in Dongxiao to contain them, to prevent accidents, and also deployed troops to guard the four city gates, patrolling all night. At the same time, the merchant corps also set out to guard the front of each shop. People's hearts began to calm down. County Magistrate Li, believing that the cause of the workers' uproar was the wage issue, gathered the contractors that night to confirm the situation and settled the wages so that they could be fully paid to the workers and they could be dismissed as soon as possible, to avoid expanding the incident.</p>

<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The National Medical Association has been established for five years. Now, on this auspicious New Year's Day, the third National Representative Conference is opened in the capital. How grand! A magnificent sight of the time. This publication also, in this special New Year's Day issue, produces a commemoration of this grand conference, soliciting articles from colleagues in the medical field. I, though lacking in talent, will share my humble opinions and write a few things as a congratulation and encouragement to the conference!</p>
<p>Whether it is a group or an individual, there must be fixed work. Without fixed work, life lacks interest; without fixed work, a group lacks value. Therefore, the scope of work must be clearly defined before knowing the responsibilities to bear, the obligations to fulfill; the goals to pursue, and the achievements to have. With achievements evident, it cannot be said to be merely existing. Since the revolution, Soviet Russia has strived for construction and defined a five-year plan as the scope of work for its government and people. Now that the plan has succeeded, it has proudly restored its pre-World War status! Is this not clear evidence? In recent years, the political situation and social conditions of our country have all tended towards chaos. Even with regard to assemblies, whether for politics, academics, professions, or various social undertakings, they are numerous within the country, with a trend of frequent changes. Examining the reason for these assemblies, some are for accommodating idle personnel, others for establishing personal influence. Therefore, there are multiple assemblies with the same nature, and what is the scope of their work, and what can be said about their achievements? A meeting should not be a mere formality, and responsibility should be specifically assigned. Work should have a scope, and then there will be interest in doing things. Upon the establishment of this association, what the general public most wants to know is the work of the association. Considering the nature of this association, it is the highest medical organization in the country, also having the nature of both an academic and professional group. Since it is said to be national, it is different from local medical groups. So, how should the work of this association be determined? In one word, the association should promptly undertake tasks that local medical groups cannot handle. As for what local groups can do, there is no need for this association to do it. In this way, the association's position can be shown to the public, and the association's value can exist infinitely. In recent years, the association's work has been almost nothing other than publishing medical journals. Is the nature of medical journals different from other medical publications? Is the work of medical journals enough to represent the achievements of the national medical community? Those with knowledge should know this. Therefore, defining the scope of work to achieve certain achievements means that this association is not a mere formality and can benefit both society and the medical community. This is one point.</p>
<p>There are more associations than ever in China today, as I have said before! As for what is called an association, it may be an association without discussion, or discussion without decision, or decision without implementation, or implementation without effort. Why have a meeting if there is no discussion? Why have a discussion if there is no implementation? Why implement if there is no effort? If a meeting is called a routine meeting and a case is called a routine case, it can be known that it is regarded as insignificant. Since the establishment of this association, there have been several general conferences! Proposals from national members are numerous, but what is the result? I hope that the gentlemen attending this conference will not have a perfunctory attitude. Know that you have come here with great contributions and hopes. The goal of the proposal should be based on feasibility; the arguments need not be too lofty, and the suggestions need not be too numerous. If it is not within the capabilities of this association, even if many points are listed, it is just empty talk and of no practical benefit. As for the meeting, the feasible proposals should be the standard for decision. Those that the association cannot implement, even if the words are beautiful and the intentions are deep, should be among those to be sacrificed. Therefore, there must be implementation after discussion, and there must be effort in implementation. Although not every case can be like this, distinguishing between urgency and implementing them in order is a firm step. Moreover, in recent years, medical colleagues often have suggestions, often sending telegrams to the government, entrusting responsibility to the central and local administrative organs. Everyone knows that politics is not on the right track, and everyone knows that the government's manpower and financial resources cannot afford to pay attention to such suggestions. Thus, those who speak are earnest, those who listen are indifferent, painting cakes to satisfy hunger is of no help. I hope that the participants of this conference will make an effort to eliminate this habit. Instead of sending empty documents back and forth and entrusting them to others, it is better to be pragmatic and reflect on oneself. Do not blame the speed of others' achievements, but blame one's own inaction. All that is decided by the general conference is what our medical community should do ourselves. This is the second point.</p>
<p>This is what I hope for the conference! Only then will this association not be a mere discussion, and the conference will not be a mere formality, and our attendance will not be in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e79">What I Hope and Advocate for Medical Education <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>(I) General Discussion</p>
<p>Gentlemen who advocate medical education! We must recognize that our esteemed China is a poor and weak country. The medical education we conduct cannot escape the scope of a poor and weak country. Weakness does not greatly affect education, but poverty has a close relationship with the cause of education. Gentlemen, in your advocacy of medical education, you should always keep the word "poverty" in mind. Then, try to develop from poverty. Then, there will be hope for medical education in our esteemed China, and it can achieve an average level of overall growth. For example, in pursuing hygiene, I also know that tall buildings are good, sufficient sunlight is good, winter hot water heaters and summer air-conditioned rooms are good, and installing wire mesh on doors and windows to prevent flies and mosquitoes is good. But most of it is not possible. Most people still live in thatched huts and cramped, dusty houses. It is unreasonable and cruel to sing high tunes with a small number of powerful people. It does not have a good impact on the overall hygiene situation in our esteemed China. How should thatched huts be improved? How should cramped, dusty rooms be improved? How should the majority of the people gradually increase the hygienic state of their clothing, food, housing, and transportation? Only this kind of hygienist understands his own unique position. It is his own fate to be born in our esteemed China, and his own position in a poor environment. The calculation of hygiene development is the overall development, not the local, deformed development. Then, it has a good impact on the overall hygiene situation in our esteemed China. Now, hygiene authorities everywhere almost all feel economically poor and have difficulty developing. They have to plan to expand their work with the lowest possible economic means. In this situation, I call it [Frugal Hygiene]. Indeed, according to the situation in our esteemed China, without this [Frugal Hygiene] method, there is no meaning for the cause of hygiene.</p>
<p>Education is the same. Last year, the education authorities knew that there were too many schools of literature, law, and commerce in our country. Compared with other practical science schools of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, it became a deformed state of development. So, they tried to restrict literature, law, and commerce, and on the one hand, encouraged practical science schools of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine. But the reason why schools of literature, law, and commerce are developed is because economic problems are easy to deal with. The reason why science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine are backward is also because they are constrained by considerable equipment and economic problems, which are difficult to cope with. Therefore, the major problem at present in promoting practical science schools is also the economic problem.</p>
<p>I will not talk about other schools. I will only talk about medical schools in our industry. To run a medical school, it is of course necessary to have considerable equipment. Those who are medical school professors must of course have considerable qualifications. I will first discuss the qualifications of professors, and then talk about equipment.</p>
<p>(II) The Issue of Teachers</p>
<p>Now, a group of triumphant people singing high tunes all say [Teachers, teachers!] But how can they be qualified as teachers? How can they not be worthy of teachers? This puzzle is in their stomachs, like a secret recipe that has never been told to others. But to determine the format of teachers in our country's medical schools, the people who are currently running medical schools nationwide should be gathered, and a few people who are mindful of medical education should be invited to hold several meetings to discuss a [Considering the situation in the country, in line with the current degree of implementation.] and measure the local economic situation, and announce it to the country, and teach them to try to meet these qualification conditions in the shortest period of time. This is the method of openness and transparency. If the puzzle is hidden in the stomach and not told to people for a lifetime, only shouting [Teachers] in the mouth and using slogans as a tool for a few people to compete for victory, teaching others to be at a loss and without a direction, I am afraid this method is unreasonable?</p>
<p>In reality, medical school professors, especially graduate school professors, should use young, new people who have research ability, are willing to do non-research work, are energetic, and are enthusiastic about guidance. These professors are considered to be superior. Experienced and sophisticated people are still in the second place. Gentlemen, you must know that the research results in medicine, the business that is very valuable and can be amazing, are all done by scholars under the age of fifty. Strictly speaking, they are all scholars around the age of forty. They are all scholars with the qualifications mentioned above. People over the age of fifty have been in old age for a long time, their thinking has become slow, their energy has declined, their adventurous nature and sacrificial spirit have regressed, and they are not suitable for academic progress. Therefore, after graduating from medical universities in various civilized countries, and after a few years of research, they are all qualified as [Teachers]. This kind of character is not limited to the exclusive possession of the [Teachers] slogan faction. There are many in the opposition, no matter which faction.</p>
<p>Why should medical school professors focus on research? Because graduate students have very high admission qualifications and already have considerable academic inquiry ability. As long as they are willing to work hard and read books, that little understanding is already there. So, they don't rely too much on the professor's lectures, unlike elementary school teachers. If a sentence is not clear, the students will not understand a sentence. If a sentence is not clear, the students will not understand a word. This is why we rely solely on the teacher's lecture power to enlighten the young children. If they are college and medical school students, the professor should be used as a role model to cultivate the student's research concept and improve the student's sacrifice for</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>academic spirit is the most important thing. If you specialize in working on oral lectures and gestures, it is not a way to treat students who have received higher education. These professors will inevitably fall into the second class.</p>
<p>But even if a professor has the qualifications of a teacher, he may not be able to develop his classroom. Because if there is not enough money in the school to hire fixed professors, then this professor cannot solve his own life by relying solely on the school salary. He will inevitably have to work part-time or hang up a sign outside to be a doctor. There will be many obstacles to research and guidance, and he will not be able to fully expand. This is purely an economic problem and has nothing to do with [Teachers]. Gentlemen who advocate medical education, if you have the power, you should try to help increase his budget so that they can hire fixed professors. Naturally, the teacher problem will be easily solved. If you must have a direct person to do it before you are happy to help, this is a human problem and factional contention. I think it is very dangerous for the future of medical education. If Zhang San gains power this month and next month, a batch of Zhang San's people will be replaced. If Li Si gains power tomorrow morning, a batch of Li Si's people will be replaced. A new emperor has new officials. Who will be willing to work hard in it?</p>
<p>In short, as long as there is considerable economy, then [Teachers] is not a problem.</p>
<h3 id="e80">What I Hope for from the National Medical Association <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Junshou</p>
<p>On this New Year's Day, the representatives of three thousand physicians from across the country gather in the capital. Separated by thousands of miles, they meet in one room, having corresponded spiritually for years, to converse intimately. What joy this is! However, given our four hundred million people and vast land of two hundred million acres, the number of physicians nationwide is limited. Furthermore, these few physicians are divided into various factions and organizations are scattered. Some are jealous, others are exclusionary. Adding to this is the naiveté of the people's knowledge and the panic of the social economy. Facing this vast future, there are still many thorns ahead. On this day of the conference, I would like to briefly state my personal hopes.</p>
<p>(1) Factions Should Be Abandoned New medicine is based on science and scholarship. There should be no rights to contend for and no factions should arise. However, when a certain faction comes to power, a certain medical school is closed, a certain institution is transferred, and certain individuals are dismissed, just like warlords occupying territory. The existence of such factions is enough to reduce the progress of academic research internally, and enough to leave a shameful international impression externally. Among the representatives at this conference, some have studied in Europe and America, some have studied in Japan, and some have studied in domestic medical schools. They mingle harmoniously, without any discord. This is a most pure group. After returning to their respective posts, I hope that all representatives will continue to uphold this spirit of cooperation and strive to abandon factions. (I once wrote an article advocating that scientific societies can break down factions, which was published in the sixth issue of "Medical Affairs Public Opinion.") This is my first hope.</p>
<p>(2) Mutual Support Should Be Practiced Physicians are merely those who treat people's illnesses; they cannot truly bring the dead back to life or regenerate flesh on bones. It is natural that they cannot always satisfy patients. (I once wrote an article entitled "The Physician's Ability and Satisfactory Medical Skills," which was published in the fiftieth issue of this publication.) I believe that those who seek knowledge also understand this deeply. However, in recent years, there have often been cases of lawsuits between physicians and patients, which are publicized in the newspapers. Investigating the reasons, it is inevitable that there is the secret assistance of colleagues. Why? Because patients, due to dissatisfaction with the physician's medical skills, are easily agitated emotionally. Even if they inevitably express resentment, if the physician in a similar position can explain and give analogies, then those who hear will also be calm and peaceful, and will certainly not want to cause further disturbances. If, unfortunately, they encounter a physician who rejoices in others' misfortune, who does not understand the medical treatment situation at the time, and adds fuel to the fire, then the patient, because an informed physician says so, believes that the fault truly lies with the first doctor. The patient then raises an army of blame and knocks on the lawyer's door, meeting the physician in court. This not only harms the harmony among colleagues but also degrades the dignity of physicians. As a result, the patient may not feel grateful; instead, they may harbor resentment. The practice of jealousy among peers is not something that our noble new medicine should have. A single word can resolve disputes, and a single word can harm the country. I hope that my colleagues will encourage each other in this regard. This is my second hope.</p>
<p>(3) Efforts Should Be Made in Popular Propaganda Replacing old medicine, which has been inherited through thousands of years of habit, with new medicine is bound to encounter incompatibility, which is both inevitable and natural. Some say that new medicine is domineering, others say that new medicine only treats the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. There are even unfounded rumors of digging out eyes for medicine and killing patients with serious illnesses. Therefore, those who practice new medicine in our country should not only devote themselves to the study of medical skills but also bear the responsibility of popular propaganda, so that society understands the content of new medicine, its advantages and disadvantages, and then it can be promoted without hindrance. (I have proposed a motion to this conference asking all local medical associations nationwide to establish popular medical lectures.) This is my third hope.</p>
<p>(4) The Poor and Sick Should Be Relieved In our country, during this time of economic panic and rural bankruptcy, who can avoid the occurrence of diseases? The term "poor and sick" can be said to be truly descriptive of reality. Should we rely on government relief? The government is too busy with its own affairs. Should we rely on social relief? Society is also overwhelmed by excessive taxes. Should we then turn to medicine? Medicine may also be affected by the panic of the social economy. However, we should not shirk our responsibility. Let us do it ourselves. Therefore, we should provide relief to those poor and sick who can be helped. This is my fourth hope.</p>
<p>(5) Attention Should Be Paid to Public Health Administration and Medical Education Are physicians only supposed to diagnose diseases? During this transitional period, we should also pay attention to public health administration and medical education. Do current public health administration measures meet our expectations? Are the country's medical schools sufficient to produce the required number of physicians? Should existing medical schools be closed down one by one? Are new and complete medical schools appearing before our eyes one by one? Are the designs of public health programs suitable for our country's conditions? All of these matters have a profound relationship with national rights and medicine. We should pay serious attention to them and evaluate their merits and demerits. This is my fifth hope.</p>
<p>The above are merely some rough points that I have made based on my limited knowledge. On this day of the conference, those who come from all directions are all outstanding talents of the time. They will surely deliberate and plan deeply for the improvement and facilities of medical affairs in our country. There is no need for me to repeat myself. I have briefly stated these few words simply to contribute my humble opinions. I hope that all those attending the conference will further instruct me. That would be my greatest fortune.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Several Fundamental Problems Urgently Awaiting Resolution in China's Medical Future (Part 1) <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Ding'an</p>
<p>In a country like China, where medicine is not yet developed, medical affairs are not yet on track, and sanitary facilities are not yet complete, due to its vast territory and large population, those of us in the medical field should rise up and urgently seek a bright future for medical affairs. This is a particularly necessary action for our nation. At a time when national affairs are uncertain and the country is shaken by crises, our medical community, aware of the increasing chaos in domestic medical affairs, should consider the overall situation for the sake of the nation and academics, and tolerate each other and work together. This is an especially urgent and important undertaking. Humbly offering my limited perspective, I would like to discuss this with my fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Medical affairs have a great impact on the nation and the people's livelihood. However, the ratio of personnel who actually undertake the work of medical affairs compared to the national population is definitely not overabundant. It can be asserted that in China, where there is no foundation in medicine, few scholars emerge. We must gather the majority and absorb new knowledge of world medicine and pharmacy, and put forth the greatest collective effort for the construction of medical affairs. Only then can we expect results. Now, with the nation's small number of medical and pharmaceutical specialists and meager capacity for medical construction, if we are preoccupied with factional disputes and sectarian views, their mutual opposition and erosion will likely hinder progress and their negative effects will be apparent and latent, without end. This is not a way to plan for the development of national medical affairs or to promote the gradual independence of medicine and pharmacy into practice. If we do not care about China's medical future, so be it. But if we want to explore the current state of medical affairs and claim that it is already on track, I dare to believe that no one would say so. Therefore, examining the causes and consequences of medical disputes and whether there is still hope for remedy and retention in the future, and studying where the crux of the problem lies, there are several fundamental issues regarding China's medical future that await urgent resolution and must not be ignored.</p>
<p>The first is the issue of the overall capacity of the medical community. Because China's medical and pharmaceutical talent is still lacking, whether or not capacity can be centralized is closely related to the expression of overall strength. Judging from the current situation, even if the entire medical community expresses its overall strength, it is still insufficient compared to the progress of medicine in other countries. This is beyond doubt. It is evident that the medical community's strength must be used economically in China's current situation, and that efforts must be made to remedy and prevent its dispersion. If capacity is dispersed due to various reasons, it will only lead to the abnormal development of medical affairs and will not benefit the overall national interest or the active progress of medicine. Especially the different ways in which capacity is used, and whether the results are negative or positive, can lead to either construction or destruction in medicine. It all depends on how the medical community's capacity is brought into play. If one advocates for medical administration with a national concept, national status, and academic evolution as prerequisites, then one truly recognizes the purpose of medicine as a sacrifice. The uprightness and selflessness of their intentions will be judged fairly. It is nothing more than hoping that the future of medicine will eliminate darkness and reveal light. Here are a few examples to illustrate that the use of capacity must be centralized from a national perspective, and that the medical community's ability to unite and cooperate depends on the effect of its capacity.</p>
<p>For example, as shown in the first diagram, the expressions of individual capacities completely contradict each other. They act independently, lacking both the spirit of mutual assistance and the meaning of unity. If the capacities of individual members of the medical community are viewed in this way, the effect of their capacities completely disappears, and a phenomenon of disintegration immediately appears. How can medicine seek consistent progress? For example, as shown in the second and third diagrams, the directions of capacity use either coincide or diverge. Some act independently, while others gather irregularly in various directions. These two diagrams are both scattered and lack a definite standard. Therefore, it can be proven that the strength of the gathering is weak, and it inevitably remains in a state of chaos. The fact that medical affairs are not on track can be explained in this way.</p>
<p>For example, as shown in the fourth diagram, a small portion of capacity has a tendency to concentrate, while the majority of capacity remains dispersed. As shown in the fifth diagram, the majority of capacity is concentrated, while a small portion of strength is dispersed. In this situation, because the claims and goals are different, it is inevitable that there will be some reduction in each other's strength. In terms of the medical situation, China especially needs to take the path of redoubling efforts. It is impossible to maintain such a phenomenon and expect progress and construction.</p>
<p>For example, as shown in the sixth diagram, only a small portion of capacity is barely concentrated, but because the majority mutually obstructs each other, the strength of both sides is reduced. As shown in the seventh diagram, each individual capacity is subject to special constraints that mutually restrain each other, so its effectiveness is equal to zero. It is entirely a negative trend. If China's medical affairs were to develop into this situation, there would be no basis for discussing progress and construction.</p>
<p>For example, as shown in the eighth diagram, although there is a situation of capacity concentration, because the strength of the organizational group is weakened, it cannot generate the strength to promote the progress of the cause. Using medical affairs as an analogy, it is better to form a large number of medical groups with weak strength than to combine the strengths of the majority for a consistent purpose, in order to generate a large-scale, truly united group that benefits national construction.</p>
<p>For example, as shown in the ninth diagram, the majority of strength diverges and concentrates in two directions, taking an average and confrontational posture. Therefore, each lacks sufficient strength to achieve the purpose of completion. They only maintain a situation of mutual incompatibility and mutual non-cooperation. Judging from medical affairs, if there are medical groups with such hostile phenomena, they cannot achieve the purpose of sincere unity and abandoning prejudices. Neither side can have any special success.</p>
<p>For example, as shown in the tenth diagram, how the entire strength, with complete consistency from all capacities, is concentrated, and what the resulting effect is, can be imagined. To seek sincere unity in China's medical community, this is the only standard. Gather the capacities of all parties, sincerely concentrate them, tolerate each other for the sake of the country, and then can we hope for the rapid development of medical affairs and the vigorous progress of medicine. If it is only seen in ideals and can never be seen in reality, then the future of China's medical affairs is full of hidden reefs, and one can imagine that there will never be a bright day.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the medical community must rely on unity and cooperation to resolve all medical disputes. Working together towards a common goal, this issue of capacity seems to be worthy of discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Achievements of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory's New Drugs in the Past Year <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Another year has passed easily, and the New Year is here again. Looking back at the past year of the Republic of China, the new medical and pharmaceutical industry in our country has continued to thrive despite the economic downturn. The establishment of medical associations in various regions, the increase in members, and the emergence of domestic new drugs, with sales gradually opening up. Taking the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory as an example, it has launched no less than dozens of new products in the past year. From among these, I have investigated the details of the most valuable drugs and described them in detail below. This is also the result of the efforts of our new medical and pharmaceutical industry, and it is a glorious page in the history of domestic new drugs.</p>
<p>▲ "Concentrated Camphonasin"●［Concentrated Camphonasin］was originally a semi-finished camphor aqueous solution injection produced by New Asia. Since its launch five years ago, it has been well-received by the medical community for its painless injection and lack of side effects. However, the camphor content was too low, and the efficacy was relatively weak. The medical community has long wished for New Asia to produce a more concentrated camphor aqueous solution. According to literature, this type of solubilizing aid is completely harmless to the human body. It does not irritate tissues after injection and can be mixed and dissolved in water and serum. However, there are few records of its preparation method in various chemistry books. Purchasing it from abroad is extremely expensive, and the finished drug cannot compete with imported products. The research department of the factory, with its unique ingenuity, was able to synthesize and produce this solvent itself, and use domestic natural camphor to produce ［Concentrated Camphonasin］with 10% camphor content, meeting the needs of the medical community. The price is low (newly set at sixty cents per box), far beyond the reach of foreign goods, even Japanese goods which are dumped here.</p>
<p>▲ "Traospoin"［Traospoin］is an injection solution made of 25% camphor, 30% quinine dihydrochloride, and an appropriate amount of alcohol. It is a very common preparation with excellent efficacy, and is widely used by the medical community. However, the various ingredients mentioned above cannot be dissolved without the use of oil. New Asia's ［Traospoin］can utilize the mysteries of pharmaceutical techniques and dissolve in water instead of oil. According to my experience, the viscosity of ［Traospoin］is only one-twentieth of that of oil-based products. It is completely painless during injection, absorbs very easily, and washing the syringe is easy, providing physicians with considerable convenience. I hope that the factory and our medical community will continue to research together, conduct animal experiments, and further be able to inject it subcutaneously or intravenously.</p>
<p>▲ "Sinocalcin"［Sinocalcin］is a preparation of calcium gluconate, with three types of products available: injection solution, oral powder, and medicated sugar. Similar foreign products were the first to be sold in our country's market, but their high prices could not be popularized among the general public. However, this drug has its own unique advantages, namely, it can be injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. Since the launch of ［Sinocalcin］, the selling price has been only one-third of that of imported products. This is because the factory can obtain low-cost domestic products, and refine and self-produce raw materials. Recently, the factory is further researching the use of electrolysis to acidify glucose and synthesize it with calcium. He discussed this with me in great detail, but unfortunately, it is a manufacturing and business secret of the factory and cannot be published in this paper. Calcium is a universal therapeutic agent. In the past, calcium chloride was widely used for injection. Now we have excellent and inexpensive ［Sinocalcin］, which can be taken orally, has a good taste, and can be injected into muscles. Medical professionals and patients benefit greatly.</p>
<p>▲ "Pixrol" The New Asia factory has used domestic rice bran to produce concentrated grade B vitamins. According to my experience, its efficacy is no less than that of the famous Japanese product. The fact that its oral solution does not contain alcohol or other preservatives is a particularly rare achievement. Recently, they have used rice bran, added appropriate temperature, and performed low-temperature dry distillation to obtain oil, which is then refined to produce a skin disease treatment agent ［Pixrol］. Its efficacy far exceeds that of ichthammol oil, and it has no irritating side effects. We should urgently promote and support these new drugs made from domestic raw materials, so I am writing this to inform my colleagues in the medical community for their adoption.</p>
<p>"Liremin" (Star Brand Liver Extract Preparation). Our country has a large population, and the number of animals slaughtered for food is very large. Although some of the internal organs are used for food, their prices are extremely low. The research of internal organ preparations is a good opportunity in our country. Furthermore, various countries are undergoing a surge of popularity for internal organ products. New Asia factory has previously launched the testicular hormone preparation ［Testosterone Association］. Recently, it has created the liver preparation ［Liremin］. According to the manufacturers of the factory, it is first subjected to a unique mechanical process to remove fat and water, and then the valuable liver hormones are extracted with appropriate solvents. The temperature during manufacturing never exceeds 60 degrees Celsius, so more components are obtained, and the blood-tonifying effect is also greater. The manufactured powder is mixed with special organ medicine, so it is not easy to deliquesce. It is easier to preserve than the powdered liver paste, and it does not change color or clump for a long time. This is also an improvement over imported products and is enough to be proud of domestic goods. According to my experience, its injectable form is very similar in concentration, color, and efficacy to the newly released German ［Hepar Comp.］. It is a valuable product among domestic new drugs.</p>
<p>Conclusion Our country's pharmaceutical industry is still in its infancy. The drugs used by new medical practitioners are all imported. The over-the-counter medicines sold in ordinary markets are purely mixed preparations of foreign drugs. In recent years, pharmaceutical factories have emerged one after another, and they have gradually learned to improve and research. Initially, only the raw materials contained in the injections used by doctors, as well as the hard glass ampoules used to hold the medicine, were imported from abroad. When the price of gold soared and Japanese goods were boycotted, New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory first focused on the self-production of hard glass ampoules, working hard and managing carefully, and has been able to supply itself. Last year, it greatly expanded and gradually paid attention to the chemical production of raw materials and the synthesis of new drugs. In the past year, it has made such achievements. Compared to the pharmaceutical industry in the past, the difference is immeasurable. I hope that my fellow pharmaceutical colleagues will work hard and move forward, accelerate research, and also hope that my fellow medical colleagues will do their best to promote and publicize it. Then the future of domestic goods will be fortunate, and the future of new drugs will be fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e83">A New Interpretation of Old Medical Practices: An Examination of Errors <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>The contention between old and new medical practices is not a recent phenomenon. However, due to differing fundamental concepts, there has been no opportunity for reconciliation. In recent times, some within the old medical community, while unwilling to completely abandon mystical theories, possess a considerable degree of self-awareness. It is regrettable that their knowledge often contains errors akin to “fish written as pig” or "hai written as shi" [errors in writing characters]. Informed observers lament this. Therefore, I will address the errors or misinterpretations found in commonly seen writings on modern scientific theories, and provide explanations. Perhaps this will be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>(1) An Examination of Errors in Mr. Ding Zhongying's Discussion on Stroke and Cerebral Hemorrhage</p>
<p>I deeply admire Mr. Ding's thorough discussion of stroke. In addition to detailing the symptoms, he extensively quotes various theories from Hejian, Danxi, and others, without offering judgment. This demonstrates his breadth of knowledge. However, when discussing modern theories, while he acknowledges that blood vessels become hardened and lose elasticity, making them prone to rupture due to occasional excitement and elevated blood pressure, he suggests that a distinction should be made between loss of consciousness and mere facial drooping or limb paralysis, arguing that not all cases can be termed cerebral hemorrhage, and that terms like "attack on the fu-organs" and "attack on the meridians" better explain the conditions. This feels somewhat misleading. In my opinion, since Mr. Ding acknowledges that stroke is caused by changes in blood vessels in the brain, he should not cling to the "wind" theory. The *Inner Canon* states that "evil wind frequently arrives, vacuous evil arrives morning and evening, reaching the five viscera and bone marrow internally, and attacking the orifices and skin externally," which is as unrelated to cerebral hemorrhage as a horse is to an ox. We should not attempt to reconcile these two disparate concepts. The blood vessels in the brain have a complex structure, varying in thickness. If a vessel ruptures along its path through different parts of the brain, it can cause various functional impairments throughout the body. Therefore, to truly understand cerebral hemorrhage, one must first understand the brain's structure and the distribution of blood vessels. In short, the brain is the center of consciousness and possesses the inherent ability to control all important organs of the body. These centers are each located in specific areas. For example, the motor center of the entire body resides in the precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and paracentral lobule of both hemispheres of the cerebral cortex. Further division reveals that the motor center for the upper limb is located in the lower one-third of the precentral gyrus, while the motor center for the lower limb is located in the upper one-third of the precentral gyrus and the paracentral lobule, as well as the upper one-third of the central gyrus. The facial motor center is located in the lower one-third of the precentral gyrus, and the tongue motor center is located in the lower part of the precentral gyrus. Their pathways are also specific. The same applies to the sensory center. For example, the visual center is located in the cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory center is located in the cortex of the temporal lobe, the olfactory center is located in the uncus, and the gustatory center is located in the anterior part of the hippocampal gyrus. The nerve fibers emanating from these centers also pass through specific regions. If these centers or their pathways are obstructed or damaged, the diseases will occur in the parts that the nerve fibers finally reach. Damage to the centers in the cerebrum will usually affect consciousness; otherwise, consciousness remains clear. The paths of blood vessels in the brain originate from the internal carotid artery and vertebral artery on both sides. Branches from the internal carotid artery include the ophthalmic artery, anterior cerebral artery, and middle cerebral artery. The anterior cerebral arteries from both sides combine to form the anterior communicating artery. The middle cerebral artery is the artery of the Sylvian fissure. This artery is more prone to obstruction than the anterior cerebral artery. Branches from the vertebral artery include the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, basilar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, auditory artery, superior cerebellar artery, and posterior cerebral artery. Here, the posterior communicating arteries link both sides. In addition, there are the anterior choroidal artery and the terminal arteries, which distribute to and nourish their respective regions. For example, the distribution area of the anterior cerebral artery is the entire superior frontal gyrus on the cerebral convexity, a part of the middle frontal gyrus, the upper one-third of both central gyri, and most of the superior parietal lobule. On the medial surface, it covers the central part of the cingulate gyrus, the orbital surface, and the olfactory region. The distribution area of the middle cerebral artery is the frontal lobe and parietal lobe on the cerebral convexity, filling the parts not covered by the anterior cerebral artery, as well as the anterior part of the occipital lobe, the upper part of the parietal lobe, and a part of the inner surface of the orbit. In the Sylvian fissure, it branches out and distributes to the inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and temporal lobe. The distribution area of the posterior cerebral artery is the posterior part of the occipital lobe on the cerebral convexity, and the entire occipital lobe and the surrounding area of the precuneus on the medial surface. The distribution area of the basilar artery is the interior of the cerebrum. Therefore, hemorrhage in different regions causes different symptoms. According to historical anatomical experience, the internal capsule is the most vulnerable site for blood vessel rupture in cerebral hemorrhage. The nerve fibers for motor and sensory functions must pass through the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Hemorrhage in the posterior two-thirds of the posterior limb of the internal capsule causes contralateral hemiparesis, while hemorrhage in the posterior one-third causes sensory loss. If hemorrhage occurs simultaneously in both legs, it causes contralateral paralysis of both motor and sensory functions. Furthermore, lesions in the cerebral peduncle cause contralateral sensory loss and ipsilateral oculomotor nerve paralysis. Lesions in the posterior pons cause contralateral hemiparesis and ipsilateral facial nerve paralysis, while lesions in the anterior pons cause paralysis of the ipsilateral upper and lower limbs and facial nerve. All of these conditions are related to the areas governed by nerves and the obstruction of blood vessels along their pathways. The symptoms of diseases are confirmed by post-mortem examinations of numerous corpses. This is not speculation or arbitrary assertion. Mr. Ding's statement that loss of consciousness indicates "attack on the fu-organs," while clear consciousness with only facial drooping or limb paralysis indicates "attack on the meridians," remains within the realm of the theories of stroke found in the *Golden Cabinet*. This is not cerebral hemorrhage. The *Golden Cabinet* states that "this disease is caused by wind. When attacked, there will be hemiplegia, or only one arm cannot be lifted." It forcibly divides the disease into "evil in the meridians, skin and flesh insensitive; evil in the collaterals, unable to bear weight; evil entering the fu-organs, not recognizing people; evil entering the zang-organs, difficulty speaking and drooling." To elaborate, "insensitive skin and flesh" means sensory loss, "unable to bear weight" means motor paralysis, "not recognizing people" means mental confusion, and "difficulty speaking and drooling" means slurred speech and difficulty swallowing. Although each of the five zang-organs and six fu-organs has a center, hemorrhage in the cardiac center causes cardiac arrest, and hemorrhage in the respiratory center causes respiratory arrest. It is not merely a loss of consciousness. Hemorrhage in the centers of the liver, spleen, and kidney, while not causing immediate death, also has its own inherent physiological impairments. It is definitely not a single phenomenon of loss of consciousness that can encompass all. As for the six fu-organs – stomach, gallbladder, bladder, large intestine, small intestine, and triple burner – except for the triple burner itself, which does not have a structural component, some have centers in the brain, while others have centers in the spinal cord. Their impairments are mostly local phenomena and do not necessarily cause loss of consciousness. Consciousness is actually governed by the cerebrum. Since the centers of the zang-fu-organs are not all in the cerebrum, loss of consciousness cannot be attributed to a stroke affecting the zang-fu-organs. In reality, it is a chaotic state of the cerebrum’s governing organs, like a careless fire in a household that throws the entire household into chaos. The extent of the damage is not necessarily related to the degree of confusion. The confusion is the same when the fire breaks out, but after investigation and organization, the damage may be severe or minor. Therefore, some people remain unconscious until death, while others recover to their normal state in a few days. This shows that it is not a true stroke attacking the zang-fu-organs. As for clear consciousness with only facial drooping or limb paralysis, this indicates that the affected area has not damaged the cerebrum, and the hemorrhage site is very localized. It is only an obstruction along the path of the nerve fibers. It is like a fire in an outbuilding that does not easily spread to the main house with its high walls. Therefore, there is no disturbance or confusion inside. Moreover, the results of today's dissections show that these symptoms are caused by internal damage to nerves and have absolutely no relationship with the meridians. Therefore, the claim of "wind attacking the meridians" is, at best, a complication of the ultimate target of the nerve fibers. It is a consequence, not a cause. I sincerely hope that Mr. Ding will first discard the "wind" theory before discussing hemorrhage, and first study the structure of the brain and the distribution of blood vessels before discussing cerebral hemorrhage. Otherwise, Mr. Ding's grand desire for reconciliation may ultimately be in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e84">A Record of Slandering Doctors <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Lao</p>
<p>A lifelong feud, how many days as a sage?</p>
<p>For no reason, merits and demerits heavily judged by Heaven.</p>
<p>If the sick should not die, why would doctors study?</p>
<p>Good fortune comes from a past life, medicine has its predestined fate.</p>
<p>Bearing criticism, they are not responsible;</p>
<p>Whenever lawsuits arise, they are dragged into it.</p>
<p>For a thousand years, the secret of the medical world is:</p>
<p>Selling both friendship and money.</p>
<p>I remember when this publication was first launched, Mr. Shi Liangcai, the owner of *Shen Bao*, said to me: "The aim of this publication is to promote science and medicine. But it is ultimately a general readership publication. I hope you can often write some humorous pieces in it, which will be more likely to attract readers' interest." For the past year, I really haven't had any funny stories to tell, and I have truly failed Mr. Shi's request. Now, as we celebrate the New Year's Day of the 23rd year [of the Republic], this newspaper is publishing a special issue. If I were to talk about depressing medicine again, it would inevitably involve sickness and death, which would be bad luck. But in our line of work, we can't say anything auspicious. Therefore, I've reluctantly written a limerick to start this article, hoping to usher in the New Year. Please listen to it as you would a ballad. I also remember that the writers of novels in the Yuan and Ming dynasties often added a "wedge" above the main text. So I will use this limerick and a lot of nonsense as a wedge. But I don't know how to write novels, and this article is not a novel. The following records are just facts from society, please think about them. Enough idle talk, the storyteller, who is neither a horse nor a donkey, is here.</p>
<p>The poem above simply expresses that Chinese doctors throughout history have developed a habit of not taking responsibility. But this bad habit of not taking responsibility was not created by doctors alone. It was caused by patients sometimes valuing doctors and sometimes looking down on them, sometimes seeing them as mysterious like immortals, and sometimes seeing them as contemptible like servants. It's really uncomfortable to be treated hot and cold. Doctors think to themselves that they are just people who know a little more about medicine than patients, so they dare to take responsibility for life. But sometimes there is no way to turn the tide and the strength is not enough. After all, it is not an intentional injury under criminal law. But the patient's family hates as if it were an incision into the bone. It seems that in addition to this doctor, there must be a medicine of immortality, and there are no incurable diseases in the world, nor should there be accidental bad luck. Therefore, after someone dies, they curse the doctor. If the disease is cured, maybe they will thank the ancestors for their blessings, or the heavens for their protection, or it is not the doctor's credit, it must be the fate of the medicine. Moreover, paying for a doctor has already settled the payment for the knowledge. It is indeed not appropriate to have any unexpected rewards. But from the doctor's point of view, in addition to rights and obligations, they only earn a curse. It feels too unfair. So they slowly developed a habit of shirking responsibility. Therefore, at the end of the old medical records, there are always a few scary tones, calling it [Beware of Sudden Changes], calling it [Prevent Chronic Diseases from Turning into Deficiency], calling it [Prevent Evil from Falling into Serious Conditions], and so on. In their tone, they are telling the patient's family to prevent it, not that he has already prevented it in his prescription. They are handing over to the patient's family the things that can be prevented in the prescription. Isn't that shirking responsibility? Also, people who had read a few books in the past could understand some medicine. So doctors were afraid that they would curse him, which would be even more harmful. So at the end of the medical record, they would write [I will try the method of so-and-so, please decide]. Or if another doctor had seen it, they would add [The method family decides]. The meaning is that although I am treating the disease, whether the medicine can be eaten or not, please discuss it with others and consider it yourself. This is both shirking responsibility and shifting blame. But now new doctors have no medical records to write, and no words to shift blame or shirk responsibility. They can only discuss it verbally. But oral words have no evidence. Often, the patient's family will seize one or two responsible words from the doctor as a basis for negotiating after the patient's death. Moreover, new doctors now use Western writing for prescriptions. The patient's family admits that they don't know it, so it's not good to ask for decisions. When the patient dies, they suddenly say [What medicine was eaten wrong?] [So many needles were given]. They can even ask a lawyer to write a lawsuit and take it to court. Therefore, new doctors are also slowly moving towards the path of irresponsibility. In fact, everyone thinks about how unfavorable this is for the entire medical care. A patient's family hires five or six doctors, making it impossible for anyone to prescribe a prescription. Everyone just says yes and no, which is really in line with the saying [It's hard for patients when ghosts fight].</p>
<p>Once, a doctor was urgently invited to diagnose a child. When he went, the child's face was pale and he was suffocating. The room was filled with incense smoke. After the diagnosis, it was bronchitis and pneumonia. He quickly opened a window to change the air, and then rearranged the spray steam in the room for them. He also urgently used oxygen inhalation to save the suffocation. The condition improved greatly for a while. The child's parents almost kowtowed to the doctor. He was busy asking for a second diagnosis three times in one day. The doctor also asked a special nurse to take care of him carefully. He thought that such a serious illness and such faith should be his responsibility. So he continued to use some injection medicine. Unfortunately, the child suddenly died in the middle of the night due to cardiac arrest. Two days later, the patient's family gave a lecture on a medical theory, saying that the strong heart needle killed the child. They forgot the dangerous signs of the pale face, suffocation, and the smoky room. They didn't even want to pay the consultation fee.</p>
<p>Once, a pediatrician gave a child with scarlet fever two doses of serum. After a week, the scarlet fever had healed and serum sickness began. Thinking that the serum was enough to kill people, they used some irrelevant methods to treat the serum sickness. I don't know what kind of medicine they ate wrong, but they lost the child. So they wanted to sue the initial doctor, and they didn't forget the scarlet fever.</p>
<p>Once again, a child had dysentery. After a doctor diagnosed and treated him for several days, when the fever was slightly receding, the doctor carelessly said, "The illness seems to be getting better today, so it's okay." Who knew that the condition would suddenly change at night, and the child would suddenly die of paralysis. When the doctor arrived, it was too late to save him. The child's mother just cried and cursed, saying that my child was delayed by you. This is the problem of not writing two sentences of [Beware] [Take Care].</p>
<p>Once again, the wife of a military officer had diphtheria for many days. She was already in critical condition when she asked a Western doctor. The doctor gave her a large dose of serum, but it was too late, and she still died. This was terrible. The military officer actually arrested the doctor and wanted to shoot him. It was easy to do good and bad, and formally transferred the case to the judicial office for trial. He also used many academic theories to prove his innocence. He finally escaped from the tiger's mouth. The doctor survived, so he had to go to another country to avoid his sharp edges.</p>
<p>Recently, a lawyer's wife contracted bacillary dysentery after giving birth. Although she had only received two doses of serum in the maternity hospital, she was discharged and asked someone else to treat her for several days. The medicine was right for the disease, but it still didn't get better, which is a common thing. But the lawyer actually filed a complaint of thousands of words in the court, accusing the maternity doctor of neglecting his duties. The court is in full swing.</p>
<p>There are probably such [slanders against doctors] every day. It's really impossible to remember all of them. In the words of cynical people, it may be a way to get rid of medical expenses. In the words of loyal people, children and wives are the most emotional. So when children and wives die, they often make it difficult for doctors. If the elderly parents die, it may be better. But I don't see it. Because I often receive obituaries of the grand fathers and grand mothers, and there is always a mourning notice attached to the obituary. At the back of the mourning notice, it is boldly written that "The initial Chinese doctor diagnosed it as a certain disease. After asking the Western doctor to give acupuncture treatment, there was only a slight effect. Friends thought it was a sign of old age. Judging from the symptoms, it was definitely not a disease that could not be treated in time. The unfilial sons and daughters did not know that the doctor's delay would lead to such regret for the rest of their lives," and so on. The meaning is that his elders were determined not to die. If they were to die, it would be because the quack doctor's treatment was not correct. If he were to study medicine, he would be able to save his parents from living forever. In fact, there are other ways to be filial. Why is it necessary to slander the doctor in writing in such a blatant way, as the last resort of filial piety?</p>
<p>Alas! It is useless to emphasize emotions and empty words, without seeking knowledge and real benefits. If you want to know how the Chinese medical community is doing, you can only listen to the future analysis.</p>
