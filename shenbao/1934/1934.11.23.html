<h3 id="c23">意奧會商興歐洲政局之動向 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 求。</p>
<p>自南斯拉夫國王亞力山大氏興法外長巴爾都氏同時被殺於馬賽以來。歐洲大局又為之一變。匈牙利政府既被指摘謂有鼓動馬賽血案之嫌疑。乃派遺貢博斯氏四出活動。貢氏既親詣反對東歐公約始終未懈之波蘭。企圖於華沙柏林匈京間成立三角聯合。以壯聲勢。繼復風塵僕於羅馬及維也納道上。不惜往返跋涉。抵掌密商。其使命何在。固不難推測者也。至於最近。南國一方面恃法羅捷克為後援。正揚言申訴於日內瓦之湖畔。而意奧則於貢博斯活躍之後。一再聚商於羅馬。竟高唱增高奧大利在多腦河流域之地位。於此之時。捷克外長皮尼士又竟以遇刺聞。皮尼士以一弱小國家之外交當局。而深負時望。此次雖幸未繼南王而為大國操編縱之犠牲工具。然其遇刺事實。則足為小恊商國遭人痛惡之明證。換言之。亦卽若干反凡爾賽系之國家企圖予法郎集圖以進一步之摧毀也。</p>
<p>吾人　論今日歐洲政局之危機。懸於多腦河之控制興巴爾幹之角逐。觀於一九一四年時之情形。前後如出一轍。惟其間縱橫連合之關係不同。斯其稍異耳。奧之於多腦河以及巴爾幹諸落後國家。本居於首腦地位。而其本國又向為羣雄紛爭之地。地戰後金融資本擴張之日。維也納尤為列強勢力侵入中南歐之捷徑焉三。當此法德仇視日深之時。羅馬政府之所以亟謀意奧匈三國之團結。甚且以增高奧之地位為此次意奧會議之要點者。其意固以為擊破法郎集團周圍各衛星之妙訣。惟此著而已。至於威脅東南歐諸小國之親法抗意運動。尤其餘事耳。</p>
<p>雖然不但此也。法自杜邁格內閣傾覆以後。其政權之重心。仍握於赫禮歐所頒導之社會急進黨。觀於新外長賴伐爾登臺後之繼續談判東歐公約。且表示波蘭對於此約之批準未必完全絕望。可以規見其一斑。賴氏此種之言論。雖不免於惹起華沙人士之驚訝。然法國外交路線之動向。則顯然有興羅馬針鋒相對之勢。倘希特勒不興意大利作死力之爭衡。法意因中歐興東南歐勢力鬥爭而引起之矛盾。似未必有一時恊調之望。若意大利果進一步而。將今年三月間所成立之意奧匈議定書加以擴張。則波匈文化恊定興德波不侵恊約發生變相的展開。或亦意中事　。</p>

<p>倫敦松平代表廿一日午後二時四十五分訪西門外相、根據東京之訓令詳細說明不能承認麥唐納首相所提妥恊試案之理由、西門我相則根據廿一日之重要閣義吐露廻避會議決裂方策之英國案、要求日本方面之同意、然日本之拒絕英國妥恊案、殆為最後的、因此會議之前途有完全閉銷之觀、英國擬於日本通告廢棄府條約後一二年間、繼續無條約無限制之海軍關係、再於適當之時期、提議現行條約之更新、此意見頗為有力、（廿一日電通電）</p>

<p>十年來未有之兇歲</p>
<p>全國收穫五千萬石</p>
<p>今午日本的天災非常重大、并且遍及全日本各地、九州方面的旱災已經不輕　足令當地農村陷於極困難的境地、大阪。神戶兵庫縣。京都府。一帶的風災［雖不是致命的打擊、卻也不是輕傷、東北青森。福島。山形。宮城。秋田。巖手等縣、凍災奇重、將一個比較有近代組織的農村、罱化成中古以前的狀態、出賣女子的事、幾乎是公開的買賣——據說每一歲值十圓、一般農民都陷於榮餋不良的苦境、有白米飯的人家、在東北各縣農村中、不過十分之二三、其餘好的吃雜糧、頂壞的竟至於嚼草根、</p>
<p>而且實際收穫之壞、竟在一般預想以上、甚至於在許多農業專家估計之上、因為自第一次估計今年將收穫五千七百萬廠米以後、既　著關西方面的大風災、正當稻子揚花的時期、所以受很大的損失、而各地方的氣候又都很冷、不適宜於榖物的成熟、的以收穫額更要減低了、其實收獲額比之去年要減少二千零八萬石、（減收約百分之二十八有奇）實收數祇五千零七十四萬六千石、這還是一種估、計並不是決定合於事實的數字、</p>
<p>在二十年以前、（一九三年）日本曾有過一次大兇歲、全國總收獲計五千零二十五萬九千石、當時每一段（約合華畝一。四八八畝）平均收一石五斗九升五合、再前明治四十三年、（一九○年）每段地平均收穫一石五斗八升一合、那是日本最近幾十年來有統計的最低記錄、但是那時代農業技術并不發達、榖種不良、耕作上也有很多缺點、施肥料又未盡善、則收穫不多、該是當然的結果、最近農業技術、雖仍舊是手工業狀況、卻已達手工業的最上乘、尤其是耕作上確已充分的加以改良、施肥選種等等主要工作、都大有進步、并且耕地面積、也年有增加、從一九二九年到去年為止、五年之間、平均收穫為六午二百五十七萬三千石、興今年比較、其減收的數目、真是有點駭人哩、</p>
<p>以各地方情形而論、用以往五年的平均數字為標準、北海道減收百分之一五。四、東北六縣受凍災的她方減收百分之四○、關東七縣減收百分之一五、北陸四縣減收百分之一九、東山三縣減百分之一四。四、東海三縣減百分之一六。六、近幾六縣減百分之一四。七、中國五縣減百分之一一。四　四國四縣減百分之二三。九、九州七縣減百分之一八。二、祇有沖繩一縣（卽從前的琉球羣島）增加了百分之五三、在東北六縣之中、減收最厲害的要算巖手縣、占百分之五八。九、是全日本收穫最不好的地方、其次是青森減收百分之四六。七、山形減百分之三九、宮城減百分之三八、福島減百分之三六。四、秋田減百分之二五、照這種情勢看、日本也許會和美國一樣、因為減收的關係、一般農村經濟還肝相當好轉亦未可知、</p>
<p>據農林部的統計、現在日本國內存米還有一千六百三十八萬九千多石、加上今年五千零七十四萬六千石、以及外米輸入一千三百萬石、而其消費預算、不過七千一百萬石、再除去估計上過高的五百萬石、也還有三百七十萬石的剩餘、事實恐未必如是、因為這中間現存一千六百三十八萬石中有政府所存的一千一百餘萬石在內、這是民間所不能白吃的、卽令日政府以較低廉的價格賣給民間、而調劉的效用依然有限、農村食不足、依然很嚴重、（十一月十四日於東京）</p>

<p>第五回　詔笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴　腸暨迫敷粉學風流</p>
<p>他身上穿的那衣服，雖然是綢的，可是這種軟緞，在江南已過分的不值錢，只賣兩三毛錢一尺了。他這衣服，還是在江南作的，只看那長度，並不是拖靠了腳後嗖，開岔有一尺多長。過了膝蓋，而初長也肘拐相平，這都不是一九三四年的樣式了。這可以證明他若是由江南來的，他也離開了江南在一年以上。腳下的皮鞋，已經是不時新的淺圓頭了，而腳背上還摜了一根皮帶。這樣子尤其是老。但這只有張介夫李士廉二人可以看出他不摩登來，在胡嫂子眼裹，他就覺得這是過分的妖治了。於是輕輕的問那沒走開的一個茶房道：那裹的，是開元寺的嗎？（註：開元寺，是唐代所建古剎，為西安古蹟之一，現娼寮羣居大門以內之兩側。妓多南人。）茶房斜了兩眼向外望著，皺了眉頭道：我不認得他。說著話時，這三男一女都到李士廉屋子裹去了。胡嫂子站起拍著巴掌，兩手一揚，笑道：今天不用提了，明天早上我再來。他說著向外走，只聽得李士廉呌著，快請賈先生，快請賈先生。胡嫂子對賈多才雖不曾有什麼關係，可是有那個類乎開元寺的人物在這裹，現在又去請賈先生，他覺得這事有點令人不平，倒要看個究竟，因之不再走開，只是在院子門邊，扶了門伸著頭向裹，就這樣的，在那裹站定著。不到十分鐘的工夫，很忙亂的腳步，來了個人，在身邊笑道：你也來了。說著那人走了過去，還帶著笑音，胡嫂子看時，正是賈多才。（七一）</p>

<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>這是三年前的事吧：咱在一家公館裹教書，足足已有了八年，因為中了［文字毒］的人，缺乏處世認識；這八年裹面，除了教書以外，只知讀書，作文，寫些醜劣小品，投到本報，前後也足有了廿年的悠久。不知道酬應交際，只知道理首塗雅，後來因為這家公館的兩位少爺，—便是咱的高徒，都已娶妻生子，年紀二十多歲了。居停待人非常厚道，送我一年的乾修，說：明年他們兩位少爺，要到銀行裹去做生意，不讀書了，請咱另行高就吧。咱到年底，當然要捧了筆筒還家。因為平日不會交際，缺乏處世認識，當然對於明年的職業，要發生問題。</p>
<p>在這家公館裹八年，因為居停喜觀煉餋跌坐，是一個道家的信徒；咱因此得讀讀道家的書籍。久而久之，卻給咱發明許多道家在科學上的價值，也許日本人還沒有說過的；坊間出版各種關於道家的書，尤絲毫沒有提及，咱常想把咱的心得，做一部［道家的科學觀的］淺明說理，來救西方物質文明的流弊。關於人生哲學，政治哲學，都把道家的學說，來下鍼砭。但，到了目下，卻一個字還沒有寫出。</p>
<p>為了找尋飯碗的動機，先把老荘的學說，做了一篇五千言的小說，題名［長生話夢，］把魏伯陽，鐘離權，呂純陽，葛仙翁，張三豐，阿仙姑等等，做了登場人物，互相來發明長生的真諦，人生的哲學。又寫了一封自薦書，和這篇小說，客給本報總理史量才先生。後來他寄了一張履歷表來，囑我填寫寄去。他的原信道：［現在國家貧弱到這般田地，咱們應該為國家社會，努力服務，那裹可以靜坐煉餋，獨求長生之術呢！］——大意如此！從這幾句話瞧來，便可以知道史先生的人生觀了。</p>
<p>史先不幸於滬杭道上遭難，丁茲叔世，使咱不得不信仰老氏的人生哲學了！但，林肯雖死，精神是長存的。咱們也母須為史先生悲吓。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>不知道是什麼綠故；我一見了這些角燈所發來的燈光，便覺得有些異樣；多半是太暗淡的綠故。再望別處瞧，每一座宮殿裹，每一條長廊下，也是同樣掛著這種角製的燈籠，透著一派深黃色的光芒。全部看起來，實在是很特別的，並且還覺得很不安靜，見了會使人發生一種恐怖的感覺。而盛京整個的宮院，每到晚上，便一齊寵罩在這種可怕的燈光之下了！我不承認我是一個膽小的人，但看了這種黯淡陰沉的景象，便不由我不發生一種無聊的幻想：以為這些宮院裹，幾百年來所死去的人物，快要像深山窮谷中的鬼怪一樣地一個一個的爬起來了；我仿彿已看見有許多奇形怪狀的黑影，在我面前晃動了，以致於使我不由自主地顫抖起來，我又懷疑我自已這種不安定的感覺，或者是明天將有什麼惡運的預兆。</p>
<p>在皇太后所居的正殿中，雖然一般也用的這種蠟燭，而且一般也是用的角製的燈籠；但這些燈籠卻並不弔在上面，而是裝在十幾條燈架上的。這些燈架的式樣很特別，原料是紫檀木，上面還有許多花紋，只是和尋常又不同；雖然一也是混身給悄龍盤繞殆遍，然而它們既不是用金或銀來鑲嵌的，也不是用各種鮮艶的油漆來描繪的，而是直接用刀子彫刻在木頭上的，所以它們的顏色和燈架的本身一樣是黑的，看起來並不如何顯著。若是要仔細欣賞的話，必須把你的眼睛湊近前去，那才可以看得清楚；最好是用手指去摸，便格外可以認識這些彫刻的工細和精緻了。（一八一）</p>

<p>說起了我們的房東，那倒是很夠味兒的。房東是近五十的老頭兒了，據說在滬西一帶，有祖傳土地十餘畝，每畝的市價，平均在一萬元以上，所以十餘畝土地，共值二二萬元左右。這些土地，都租給了人家，每年可收租金一萬餘元。但是那老頭兒，卻穿的是黑布綿襖袴，布襪，布底鞋，每天抽著一百多文的黃煙。在菜園裹灌水，除草，收穫之後，挑著入市呌賣，便是他的惟一工作。</p>
<p>他的妻，和他的大孫女兒，每天除了煮飯洗衣之外，便都把時間，消磨在做長錠興火柴盒上面。據說。一天可有二百文的進益。他的兒子，是一家洋行裹的出店，雖他將來有值到二十萬元的遺產可得，但是他從家裹到洋行，足有十路，不論風雨寒暑，都是徒步往來的。他的媳婦，是七個孩子的母親，從哺乳一直到孩子的衣著，都是伊一人操作的。他的大孫兒，二孫兒，各念了三四年書，現在都已在習業了。都是洋行裹的學徒。</p>
<p>我從鬧市中遷居到靜僻的滬西，更興如此一個家庭鄰居著，我幾乎疑心我不是在這個都市裹信居了。</p>

<h3 id="c194">虎邱凝睇（續） <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>虎邱十二景中的［平林遠野，］大約就指這裹而言。閣的東面，更有瞭望臺，有軍人在那兒站崗，想來他們據高臨下，太湖中的沙鳥風帆，蘇州城內的寸馬豆人，都逃不過他們的遊目的了。</p>
<p>繞白粉短墻，穿過了寫有［巍然］的門洞，那座好像喝醉了酒的老人形的危墖，便如此頹蒼的悄立在夕陽中，磗塊剝蝕　古紅，露出灰白的瘦骨，泥均裹生了了前朝的蔓草，有野鳥興　　巢穴在那裹，自會呌人低徊嘆息。然而虎邱塔的美麗，也正在於殘缺欹斜。五年前來此憑吊，滿以主這塔快要摧隳了，而今日還是點綴著七里山塘；自家雖還年輕，怕沒有瞧見虎邱塔倒毀的幸運了吧。</p>
<p>一路上有些惆悵，就從荒邱瓦礫中，尋得了小吳軒的後門，一看被軍人駐守在那裹，只得從禪寺裹穿出，循五十三參的石級踱下來，眼前正是一片血紅色的千人大石，平滑光緻得可愛。真的，除了虎邱，這片石是沒有地方能找的了。至於神話的點頭頑石，斷樑殿，劍池，在我以為沒有什麼是處。尤其真娘墓，鴛鴦墓，毫無意味可嚼！</p>
<p>烏鴉飛在頹塔的落霞中，遊人漸漸散了。但照轉不見了纔回　門去。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c195">初冬的展覽 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>鮮明的楓葉，紅於二月之花，籬下黃葩，也五色競秀，大地上好似披上一層錦繡班雅十騒人，更將園藝珍品，陳列展覽，兩星期間蘇州有公園東吳留園幾處盛會，現在把它們的展覽品，約略寫出若干，給一班愛發園藝者作紙上的欣賞罷。</p>
<p>菊花</p>
<p>菊的種類，真是名目繁多，花的顏色和形態也富麗秀美，各極其妙。菊花的種類，大約可分絲，帶，角，辦，管，爪　，毛，球，如意，夾色等十種。［絲］這種菊花，花辦絲絲分垂，好像流蘇一般具著疏散逸蕩的風韻；像一十丈珠　，［白龍鬚，］［亂雲］等品，就是屬於這類。［帶，］這種菊花，花辦比絲短而闊，怒張舒展，清幽中別具富麗；有白玉帶，麒麟帶，等品。花辦的尖端；模稜有角，就是菊花中的［角］，像麒麟角，大青龍等，都是具有雄奇姿態。菊花中的［瓣］，在姿態方面，太含富貴氣象，失卻隱逸風韻，然而雄巨的花朵，闊大的花瓣，自有一種雍容華貴的氣概。這類花，有［荷花十八瓣］［灑金十八瓣］［綠牡丹］［雪青荷花］等。［管，］這種花，花瓣中空如管，是菊花細品中未見佳妙的東西，像［老君眉］等，可是培餋方面，卻很艱難。菊花形態中，最飛舞雄奇的，自當當推［爪］了。爪的花瓣，鈞展如爪，這種菊大率花朵巨大，姿態雄奇有［白龍爪］［虬龍髯］等品。［毛］是在花瓣上生著細細的毛，有黃毛，綠毛等，形態也很美麗。［球］，這種花兒，花瓣是鈞曲還抱。生得好似球兒一般，形式是很可愛的。［如意，］枝梗很長，花朵卻生得小巧玲瓏，彷彿長柄如意一般。［夾色］是一朵華上，有著兩種顏色，像［綠衣紅裳，］外面淺綠，裹面卻是緋色，［二喬］是紅白雜著，顏色是怪美麗的。此外還有人工的紥花，大者逾抱，高幾及人，可是太俗了，未免失卻菊花隱逸的風味呢。</p>
<p>金魚</p>
<p>金魚，在［龍種［［蛋種］［草種］三者以外，還有［珍珠魚］和［燕尾魚］兩種。珍珠魚的印鱗，一顆顆的墳起，圓圓的好像粒粒珍珠；這種金魚，飼餋十分煩難，這次公園魚菊展覽會中，泗井巷孫宅的珍珠魚，共陳列兩桌，大者長幾及尺，確然不是易事。燕尾魚的魚尾，雖然單尾，但特別長大，游泳起來，夭矯柔和，另有一種悠然的態度。紫羅蘭魚，是紫蘭主人心愛的金魚，全身紫班，游泳在綠藻裹面，別具勝概。［堆玉］的魚頭上，堆著軟肉，好似虎頭一般；［絨球］在金魚嘴邊，生著圓圓的肉球，有鬆緊兩種，大的足有桂圓大小。此外還有［翻鰓］［水泡眼］等等，［翻鰓］的魚鰓，完全向外翻轉，［水泡眼］的眼球，好似兩球軟的水泡，在水中游泳時，兩個眼球，軟軟的會得伸縮，據說一個不小心，就要弄破眼泡，變成盲魚。此外有一種呌［紅帽子］的，全身銀色頭部紅紅的好似帶著一頂紅色帽兒，顏色是特別的艶麗。</p>
<p>瓜果</p>
<p>在金魚菊花之外，北瓜，珠瓜，也是這幾天展覽的物品，北瓜的顏色，是那麼硃紅，鮮　；珠瓜是北瓜的變種，形式是有大，有小，顏色是有黃，有白，在瓜的外面，生著粒粒圓珠，配著各種瓷盆，卻也悅目可愛。在這秋風蕭蕭，鴨肥蟹黃的時候，持繁賞菊，把酒評魚，卻也是人生樂事，［人生行樂耳，］居今之世，外名利，自尋煩惱呢？</p>

<p>今日繼續舉行成績均平常</p>
<p>江大體恊會之全能運動，於昨日起開始在本埠水電路持志大學舉行，持志因屬地主之誼，佈置及招待等，十分周到　昨舉行五項及十項前部暨千六百米接力三項、中央均佔優勢、穩得冠軍毫無問題、且五項運動前四名、均為中央選手包辦、接力亦屬中央冠軍、惜成績平平、美中不足、今日下午二時起繼續舉行十項後部、及四百米接力暨異程接力表演等、詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>五項運動</p>

<p>千六接力</p>

<p>糾紛起因齊大自朱經農校長去職後、即推文理學院院長林濟青代理、二年於茲、頗著成績、本年六月十五日開校董會議、僅有少數人出席、論及校長問師、惟因校董方面、竟見未能一致、林代校長、決意辭職、　大多數、主張挽林繼續維持、省主席韓復榘教育廳長何思源建設廳長張鴻烈財政廳長王各榮、亦會電孔祥煕、申明此意、八月十五、再開董事會、全體董出席、也部長亦有電到濟、當時通過著林濟青即為正式校長、林彼時、允予考慮、惟聞學以後、　校董中有一部分、對彼不表同情、於是　校赴滬、就中央銀行事、而孔氏覺此事內部情形複雜、故亦決將董氏長名義辭去、殆十月又聞常務校董會議決請也氏就董事長、並請林校長回校、公　校　長德位思及衣振青赴滬敦　、當時林意以孔當長之意志為意志、而也部長則意　、如林回校、則董事長一席即可擔任、德位思等回魯後、孔部長意欲再請董事會內推舉二人赴京、由孔親自　解、使內部化除意見、惟西籍校董堅不欲去、近更集合少數校董開會、推翻以　數次會議、而將另著代理校長、不照全體董事會議決案辦理、舍正道而不由　蓋代理校長　職　固極難物色　而暑假後、百務待正式校長辦理　此學生之急於要求解決者也、</p>

<h3 id="c216">文藝品 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>古人批評文藝，詩，文，繪畫，甚至書法，常呌做什麼品什麼品。就詩而說，最著名的，有種嶸的［詩品］，這書把漢魏到梁的一百單三個詩人，分為三品。還有司空圖的［詩品］，分得列多了，有二十四品。</p>
<p>［品］字的本義是衆多。說文：［品，衆庶也，從三口］。段玉裁注：［人三為衆，故從三口，會意］。［品］字的本性是形容。易云：［品物流形］。引伸的意義，作為名詞的，有等級，物件，風格，作為動詞的有評量。批評文藝用的［品］字，雖也有物件和風格的意思，但主要是指等級的。這等級是封建社會層累等級制的反映。</p>
<p>批評呌［品］，批評的結論也呌什麼品，［品］字的本義，就湮沒了麼？骨子裹仍有的。封建社會是等級的社會，封建社會的等級是衆多的，衆多的等級反映到文藝上，等級也是衆多的。這是一種解釋。批評因人而不同。文藝的等級也因人而不同。這就呌做［人三為衆，故從三口］。這是又一解釋。</p>
<p>現在的［品］字，物件已萬為主要的意義。凡製造物，都呌做品，文藝不能例外。凡製造物，都是商品，文藝也還很少例。［藏之名山，傳之其人］人這種宗法社會師從間的授受，已是過去的美談了。［靈感是不能賣的，但是那文章卻能賣］，［文藝興批評］一書中所引的這句俗話，是只有一半對的。因為文章能賣，所以被寄托的靈感也能賣。從這見地，我懷疑　性靈］的話說。標榜［性靈］的人，他們的［性靈作］——這裹必須避免［品］字——，是出賣的，還是不呢？如賣，［性靈］也成為商標了。</p>
<p>有人追問為什麼沒有偉大的創作，有人責罵雜文，並認為沒有偉大的創作就在雜文的盛行。沒有偉大的創作的意思，想不是說沒有創作，而是有了卻不見得偉大。果真這樣，雖然是創作罷，也就無異於雜文了。創作對雜文的差別，只是在寫作時換了一個形式。這是誰也雜文，就是不偉大的創作了。這和中國工業的命運，可作同樣的看法。出品不良，規模狹小。</p>
<p>因為自已的工業品不好，一方有外貨的暢銷，一方有國貨的提倡。在文藝上，也一方有人從事創作，一方有人從事翻譯。這卻不能同樣看法。工業受國外的桎梏，不過事實是擺明著：提倡國貨，改良國貨，取法西法好呢，還是沿用土法的好？</p>
<p>文藝品被決定了是商品。固然不應以為不是這樣就當作神聖，但也不必以為是這樣就是　凟。商品也不是可以一例看待的。牠包含有，為特種人製造的奢侈品，鄙俗的粗製品，和位在這中間的生產品。</p>
<h3 id="c217">捕［鼠］ <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 蕩天</p>
<p>最近我從北方來，住在朋友的家裹。朋友是近視的，我也是近視的。</p>
<p>一晚朋友從浴室出來，說是看見一隻大老鼠在裹面，問我要不要打。我記起兒時捉了老鼠，用火油淋遍牠的身體，當衆焚燒的趣劇，又想起前幾夜夢中醒來的時候，似覺有老鼠繞床跳躍的事，就一邊從床上跳起來，戴上眼鏡，一邊對朋友說，［要打！要打！馬上就動手！］</p>
<p>浴室和亭子間是連在一起的，中間只隔一層板壁，浴室裹面沒有灑，只靠亭子間的燈光映進去。我們第一個動作便把浴室的門緊閉起來，因為恐怕老鼠逃走。第二個動作便開始找武器——打老鼠的東西。兩個人站在亭子間看了一會，想了一回，跑上前樓站了一下，又加到這子問去。最後，朋友捧一個餅乾罐，我拿一把破紙傘，推開門走進去，由他把守門口，我用傘往浴盆底下攪撥。咚！一隻約莫一英尺長二斤多重的黑毛［老鼠］跳出來，碰在板壁上，又躲回盆底下去。［老鼠］是那麼粗大，那麼兇猛，朋友早已嚇得拋了罐子，雙腳踏上盆邊了，我的心裹也喫了一驚，雖然破傘還緊緊地握在手裹。兩人定過神來，開口驚歡這樣龐大的［老鼠］不易看見，恐怕只有世界第一次戰那時候的戰壕裹才能找到，所以覺得非把牠打死不可。於是由朋友向一房東借了一把柴刀和兩根松柴來，同時我把拖鞋除去，換上一雙藍球鞋，預備踏牠幾腳。這一次還是朋友做門口把守者，他兩手分握兩根松柴，我左手拿破傘，右手拿柴刀。破傘撩進盆底去：沒有反應，用力搖撥，還是一樣。我們疑心［老鼠］在我們第二次找武器的時候逃竄去了，可是那浴室的地面是水門汀的，決計沒有窟窿，兩扇窗戶是緊緊地閉著的，我們出來時又沒有忘記把門推攏來，對銷的工作做得這樣嚴密，牠實在沒有逃脫的可能，於是再接再厲，拼命往盆底撩攪。咚！剛才出現過那隻［老鼠］果然跳出來，又碰在板壁上，躲𡇱盆底去。松柴，柴刀，破傘，籃球鞋都沒有顯出它們的作用來。</p>
<p>朋友說是不好下手，不想打了；我卻不肯甘休，還請他一同想一個更好的辦法。結果由他提議，用木板把浴盆不　牆那兩邊攔住，倒一桶開水下去，［老鼠］自然會被燙死的；我想實在沒有比這個再高明的法子了，便贊成他。我留在那兒看守；　他到外面去呌泡水館送水。不一會，他就回來，手裹拿了一條小鐵棒，背後跟著一個送水的夥計。朋友把我們的［工作］告訴他，他馬上願意一同參加。這一次還是我負搜索的責任，那夥計替代了朋友剛才的職務，把守門口。我依然以破傘為先鋒，插進盆底去，攪了半晌，不見聲息，擦一根火柴照歸類，一團手毿毿的東西鬈伏在角落里。那夥計在概看見我是近視的，對我說，［讓我來，拿洋火給我！］洋火遞給他。他蹲下去，眼睛望著盆底，擦了一根火柴，隨即說，［哦！一隻小貓！］朋友和我都駭住了，面面相看，當時的心情此刻真是分析不出來。［不是吧？｝我從失望的深淵中醒過來，吐出這樣的一句。夥計又擦了一根火柴，照著牆壁興浴盆之間的　隙，探頭　瞧，還是說［一隻小貓，黑的！］</p>
<p>朋友笑了，我也笑。一幅可怕的社會真景展開在心頭。我　們慶幸我們不是小貓的創子乎。</p>
<h3 id="c218">路邊小店（上） <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>—千崖回記憶之一—</p>
<p>簷前起著一下雨打紙傘的驟響，一個裹著黃布袈裟的光頭僧人，便呵哈地呌著走了進來，立刻將剛剛打掃乾凈的土，印起一串拖泥帶浆的是足印，和一線雨傘上落下的水滴了。他一面用著擺夷話和漢人話混合的日常慣用語，招呼屋裹的主人［比發，來一盒煙！］就把水濕的雨傘順床腳一放，身子便一下子倒在放有煙燈的床上了。我們覊留在這咱邊黃果樹下的茅草店內，躲避著擺夷地方初次降的瘴雨，心裹已經感到沉重和不快了，現又看見一雙醬滿泥漿的大足，高高地蹺在床沿邊上，很觸日的現在眼前，就使人更加煩燥和不安。</p>
<p>同行一個抬滑竿的，原是趁著落雨沒人來，坐在篾笆的窗邊，將一條抬人的竹竿，鑽小洞，打算灌進煞熟的鴉片煙，好在到了洗馬河的時候，瞞過野人偵緝隊的搜查。一看見了擺夷和尚的忽降臨，便趕忙放開了正做著的東西，假裝無事樣地龍著手，不高興氣色，卻表露在翹起的嘴唇上，剛咕嚕一句［和尚都要吃大煙，］恰巧又看見被擺夷和尚呌做比發（大嫂）的女主人，正顯出招待貴客的歡喜神情，佛爺佛爺地喊著，盡力柔聲媚氣討好賣乖，就又使他喃喃不清地罵了一句。</p>
<p>［嚇，那樣兒：哼，老不正經！］</p>
<p>下層社會的人總是愛毫無忌憚的發揮情感，往班會惹起打架的事情來的，倘如這個狹小的路邊店子，再有動武的事情出現，那就越加使人住不下去了，我便做出息事寗人的態度，拍了他的肩頭一下。</p>
<p>［矮，小聲點，看人家的兒子會聽見哩！］</p>
<p>馬上另外的兩個人，他的夥伴和一個整天張口打哈欠的私煙販子，都一齊抑止不住似地大笑起來。同時給我認寫女主人的兒子，正把一張上了三十年紀的粗臉，從肩上掉現過來，激現出不好意思的神色，趕快又掉轉回去，仍舊低著頭坐在土灶　邊守著大氣蓬勃的鴉片煙鍋。大約因為看見他不好意的原故吧，我們這邊的三個人更加笑得厲害了，一枝抖顫在手上的短旱煙管，竟然跌落到地上。</p>
<p>［笑破了嘴巴，看怎麼撒得成片片尿呢？］</p>
<p>女主人跑過來，一手揪著一個人的耳朵，用力地一扯，惡毒地罵了這麼一句，立刻掉轉抓開床腳邊的雨傘，呌道：</p>
<p>［呵呀，流這麼一灘水了］</p>
<p>熬着鴉片煙的男子，這次並沒有𡇱過頭來，只是在不安地亂搔著緾在頭上的黑布包頭，同時金必的小瓢，在盛煙的銅鍋邊上敲得刺耳地發響。</p>
<p>［就像才十五歲哩！嚇嚇。］</p>
<h3 id="c219">關於［唐·吉訶德］中的譯本 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 唐錫如</p>
<p>自由談上要求唐吉訶德中譯本的呼場，要是我沒記錯的話，連十一月十五日苗埒先生的［我們所需要的譯本］，已經提過兩次了。</p>
<p>中國真的沒有這種傻瓜去幹這種［冷門］的貨色嗎？不，有的，我親眼看見的，不過牠沒福邀到出版家的青睞，所以也就沒福給大衆知道罷了。我想這大概是因為譯者是個［無名小子］罷？這苦痛，這悲哀，該是許多［無名的］寫譯的人共有的。</p>
<p>我還記得兩年前的暮秋，我在廣州失業了，因為閒著太無聊，又因為住的地方是芳草後街，恰對著中山大學後門，所以每天便跑到圖書館裹去，繙充法國莫洛懷氏著的拜倫傳，同時和我一樣早出暮歸，有時夜晚仍坐在圖書館裹的，一個瘦個子，微黑的臉孔，戴了一副深度眼睛的青年，樣子一看就是個［不識時務］的傻瓜，他也在不倦的繙譯一部書，後來因為碰頭得多了，有的時候因為兩人爭奪一部字典或百科全書，所以便索性坐在一起，在一起的機綠裹，我才發現到這位傻瓜先生在譯著一部驚人的著作，那就是西萬提司的唐。吉訶德。</p>
<p>我看到他譯這部書的時候，聽說他已經這樣一天十二三小時的譯了兩年多了，兩卷原文已將近譯完，不過還得化一年左右的功夫去做註釋。</p>
<p>他的譯筆是忠實的，至少態度是十二分忠實的，我看他參看譯本，法譯本，（他是從英譯本裹出來的）我看他翻英文字曲，法文字曲，日文辭曲，西班牙文字典，我還看到他請問過許多位中山大學裹的外國教授，我有時看到他一天譯不滿一千字，便替他這種［螞蟻搬泰山］的工作害怕，害怕裹又帶了敬佩，敬佩他這種不怕艱難的毅力，最後想到他這種螞蟻一般的速率，居然給他就要爬到這長距離的終點時，不禁又替他喜歡，而也就更加敬佩了。</p>
<p>在第二年的春天，我把拜倫傳譯完了，同時彷佛他的註釋工夫也做完了，在馬路上碰到他的機會，比在圖書館裹的更多，我有許多次看見他坐在人力車上，垂頭喪氣的陰灰著臉，後來我在快要離開廣州，回一上海時，有一次看見他臉上發光了，接著，就在下一天，廣州的民國日報副刋內，他的唐。吉訶德譯文發表了。我才知道他前時陰灰著臉的由來，同時也曉得他的名字是［默無］，而且曉得他還不過是中山大學裹一個學生，默無倒底是他的真名，或是筆名，我到現在還有一些疑惑。</p>
<p>天天到圖書館裹去看他的譯文的，我不敢說沒有人，可是我是每天必看的一個。他的譯筆的忠實，順暢，我到那時也就有了更深的認識。</p>
<p>我回來上海了，我的拜倫傳遭到了意料之中的各書局的拒絕，同時我也常常想到這位比我傻瓜氣更十倍的譯者的命運，他的即使在報屁股上的命運，怕也不會長久地順利罷？認要看這既不是［我愛］，又不是［他媽的］的沉悶（！）而冗長的譯品呢？</p>
<p>而不料自由談上居然有人要求中譯本的唐。吉訶德，我給默無先生感到了一陣無限的高興，又是一陣傷心的戰憟。</p>

<p>現在要輸到我呆想地望著他。這一千阿克的土地去冬只餋活了三個工人。但是他剛才說過的半個人是什麼？</p>
<p>［呀！是的，］他微笑著說，［那個殘廢者……我的殘廢者……起始他是我家裹的村丁……當改革農村辦法時，我們地主要是我們願意收留　個殘廢者，我們可以別外多得幾個［阿克］。這樣，我們可以救出正好餋活這個殘廢者的一塊土地。對於我，他給我賺進了六十［阿克］……對於他，也是落得，因為億生活問題解決了……。他只剩了一隻腳，是大戰（即一九一四年至一九一八年的世界大戰——譯者）時傷的，得國家百分之百的津貼。</p>
<p>在一個殘廢者身上賺進六十［阿克］，這的確不是一件等閑的事。</p>
<p>經過牛棚的面前，我看見一個異樣的泥土築的小棚。我以為這是一間放馬鈴薯，洋花　葡或是麥的屋子。但是屋頂上一個煙囪正出著煙。</p>
<p>［這個是什麼？］我問。</p>
<p>［這是殘廢者，‘地方說，［殘廢者所住的地方。］</p>
<p>［可不可以進去？］</p>
<p>［當然。］</p>
<p>那個小棚有著一扇小得無可再小的門，剛剛只夠人把身體摺做兩斷的進去。我們到了一間小極的用做廚房同時算做坐落間，可是最大的部分被灶頭興一隻大的洗衣桶占去了。</p>
<p>右邊一扇門通達一個小角落，從遭個極小的角落裹走出了一個快樂的滿面春風的小女人。</p>
<p>［今天好，先生們。］她快活的說。</p>
<p>［今天好，媽媽，］我說，一怒可允許我們參觀你的居屋？］</p>
<p>［進來好了，］她回答，［這是一座小而可愛的屋子……］於是她往旁讓開，使我們進去。</p>
<p>屋子，連堆放雜物的小樓間也沒有。泥的屋頂精細地粉飾著石灰。唯一的窗子沒有比插在外衣袋裹做裝飾的手帕那樣大。一隻牀，一隻桌子，兩隻椅子，興一個小小的櫃子，這些便是整個家具。其實，那房間裹也只能放這一點東西。</p>
<p>［這裹你們住幾個人？］</p>
<p>［我興丈夫兩個人，興三個孩子。］</p>
<p>［這便是他們唯一會做的事情，］地方帶著［點不快的神氣說，［生孩子！四年裹生三個，可真不錯！］</p>
<p>［呀！先生！］女人回答，同時把她的手　潔地放到那門牙脫去了，嘴吧上，［我們結婚了已五年。］</p>
<p>在這個時候，有人來找地方；一隻母牛正在生產。一個擔心的神氣，東家走了，因為一隻母牛，是值錢的東西。</p>
<p>［請坐。］女人一邊用手指著椅了，一邊對我說。</p>
<p>我坐了下。</p>

<h3 id="c240">取締腐化稱呼 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 皮</p>
<p>據十八晶報載，［內部頃通令各省，取締老爺，太太，小姐，少爺，等腐化稱呼，以免貽笑外邦。並悉令飭嗣後，一律改稱先生，老先生，或學生］云云。</p>
<p>電文簡略，恐有示詳，茲特將電文中所公表者，稍為之引伸其義，腐化稱呼之亟應取締，原屬當然的事，一則，此種稱呼，對建色彩，異常濃厚，二則，暴露著一種階級觀念，明令禁止，殊為合理。</p>
<p>惟一律稱為先生，或老先生，則尚有須斟酌之處。男子通稱為先生，固無不可，而婦女亦稱為先生，則不免有渾通之嫌。現在男女，雖屬平等，而陰性陽性，生理上究有不同，我意女子已嫁者稱為女先生，未嫁者稱為某某女士，或即某小姐，也未始不可，因小姐二字，尚無階級性，如大姐，阿姐，四姐，三姐，原屬通稱也。</p>
<p>卽如外國，男子稱［密斯脫，］末嫁女子，則稱［密司，］已嫁女子，則稱［密綏司，］男女之間，自有一種表示陰性陽性的稱謂，我國雖不必定要摹仿歐美，但男女之間，自應有一種顯然的判別，原屬當然的事實。</p>
<p>至於貽笑外邦，到也未必見得，因為一個風俗習慣，固各有不同，外人見我國的一切稱謂禮貌，引為奇異者固多，而我國人見外人的一切稱謂禮貌，而視若奇特者，也不在少數。卽如稱呼而論，外人稱為［密斯脫］或［密綏司］禮節而論，男婦相見握手等，現在司空見慣，視如尋常，然在當初通商時見之，亦未當不以為奇特也。</p>
<p>惟暴露封建色彩，和顯示不平等觀念，稱謂原僅一端。此㢇婚，喪，慶，弔，等事，現怒未會規定一種若通儀式，而人家往往沿襲滿清之舊，踵事增華，封建色彩，階級觀念，隨處表現。此種腐化禮節，也應一律嚴厲禁止，庶社會上不至再現此種怪現象，是也和稱呼同堪注意者也。</p>
<p>而封建色彩之最難廢除者，即是及服制度，現在各人所御的衣服，尚是沿襲滿清之舊，最好也當改革，長袍馬褂，因為習慣關係，並開不覺為詫異，但一思滿情入關情形，則易服式各難髮令，同為人民所反對。並且長服之制，規行矩步，落　落大方，完全表現著文弱的態度。昔趙武靈王主張胡服，提倡尚武精神。現在錢血世界，文弱之邦，在世界上並沒有立足的餘地，則衣服制度亦宜從事改革，此其又一事也。</p>

<p>— 張毓</p>
<p>小時候和同伴們捕麻雀，在院子裹張了一面網，網下撒了米，一角撐了一枝竹片，在竹片的上端縛著繩，這繩就通到堂屋裹，幾對小眼睛從明殻窗中注視著那羣在屋頂進退維谷的小動物，—它們呌著，飛站，彷彿商議下面這陷阱中的食物我們要不要冒險去倫竊來，這樣吱吱喳喳了一陣，富於經騐的老麻雀們一定驚告它們，這下面已經進埋伏著敵人。在你們沒有獲得食物之前，已反而作為敵人的俘虜了。而且在它飽經世故的面上，說出許多在這種場合下喪生的老同伴。小麻雀們靜聽著，一方面深信這故事是真實的，但是那像女人一樣富於誘惑生的米粒的影子始終停留在它們眼角邊，它們想作一度的冒險，或者它是最倖運的一個而逃避了那可怕的危機。自然，在生命的食糧面前，警告牌是永遠不發生效力的，我們用這面網。為生活而冒險來的</p>
<p>現在我們捕雀子的同伴，自身也在這生活的無形之網有徘徊著，有的已經不顧一切大步邁進了。自然那些小雀子在網中掙扎的情狀我們是不會磨滅的，在我們動手戳殺它們的時候，它們在我們掌握之中還想作最後之逃遁，同伴目覩著這殘酷的行為而抖顫得無力支持它們自已小小的身體，有的不必我們處死，已在網中驚暈了過去。現在做劊子手的人也直逼到這網的陷阱前了，另一類的劊子手他們也決不會放過我們的，那末為什么不設法避免這種危機呢，不能到網的外面去生活嗎？這警告牌我們已經自已豎在每個人的當面前了，我們謹慎地逃避著這生活之網，希望像屋頂上的小麻雀一樣，那樣自由地從這樹枝到那樹枝，或者幾個子在空子追逐著；但是那像女人一樣富於誘惑性的米粒的影子始終停留在我們的眼角邊，我們的一步一少逼近這生活之網，並不如小麻雀們冀希自已是最倖運的一個而逃避了那可怕的危機，我們明知道是無從逃避的，一旦做了這網中的俘虜，已經是上了斷頭臺了。可是我們不能忍受這眼前的威逼，那米粒是壓迫著我們向網所主宰了的，在這絕大權威的掌握之中，警告牌是永遠不會發生效力的！</p>
<h3 id="c242">醫院裏底妻 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>想起妻將要抱著剛生出世的嬰孩出醫院，心裹暗地覺得非常地快樂。因為一個家庭中只有孤單單的夫妻兩口兒，的確寂寞得委！有時因為一方面的心境有點不好過，或受了外來的刺激，兩方面時常會因細故而起了爭執；而且妻是一個好勝心極強的女人，時常因主我固執興不肯讓步，把一雙明眸的眼睛哭得像胡桃般的紅腫起來。</p>
<p>［也許有了小孩子，可以做我們的緩衝，那時候，我們間的細故無理的爭執，就會因小孩子的天真的嘻笑而無形地減少了。因此，家庭中也就融樂起來，我想。］當每次和妻爭鬧過了之後，彼此間都有點兒感到懊悔的時候，我總是這樣地對妻說，妻卻也默默無主地點著頭。</p>
<p>現在妻將要抱著初生的嬰兒出醫院了，我暗暗地預祝著我們的融樂的家庭：從此將不會發生了無理的吵鬧和像深山攻起妻將出院的時候的那筆付還醫院的費用，又使我的心旌感到非常的不安。</p>
<p>［仁！今早醫生已來看過了，他說熱度已退，如果今晚再不會發熱的話，那末，就可以出院了……］妻把枕頭高墊在背脊上，從睡床上半躺著身子地坐起來，嘴角堆著笑容［我想出去也可，老躺在這裹調餋也不是萬全的上策，同時也可以省了一些住院的錢。并且你天天得到這裹來陪我，也太費了你的寶貴的時間。……］</p>
<p>［呃，可是，……你還得再住……］嗓子像鉛塊般的沉重。</p>
<p>其實妻的熱度的退盡，和可以出院的消息，醫生早已告訴我了。可是，今早的四處奔走，為了錢的問題，受了許多的氣，碰了一鼻子灰，一個個的朋友都好似知道我此來拜訪的目的一見了面就先向我說，連篇的窮話，但為要使妻得安心靜餋，怕傷了她的脆弱的心，這滿腹的悶氣，我又得硬噎在肚子裹，不讓牠發洩出來，雖則我也希望妻能夠早些日子出院，然因經濟的困難，要快點兒出院也不是可能辦到的。</p>
<p>［怎麼？……仁！你還是要我多過些醫院的孤寂靜穆的日子嗎？］妻擔著說，聲音比剛才來得響亮，分明有些兒氣憤。</p>
<p>［儂，幹嗎你又生氣了？］我把坐位更移近一點，緊握著她織織的手。［你得好安心地靜餋，等到完全恢復了健康是多麼的要緊，尤其我們這些天涯淪落人！同時，天氣又一天一天的寒冷下去，那間亭子間委實太狹窄和冰冷了，我們得設法再找好一點的房子才行。］</p>
<p>［我想還是讓我早點出去吧，再住下去，錢一定用得太多，我們應該估量我們的力量。］妻遲遲地說，語氣平息得已變成老年人一樣的和緩興乏力，我推想到她一定憶起了過的困迫的可怕的日子了。</p>
<p>過著幾分鐘的沉默，我終於打破了這死寂的空地說。</p>
<p>［儂！就忍心再住多一兩天再出院吧。］</p>
<p>雖然小孩子是天真的，可愛的，但當我想起妻的出院的那筆費用，頓時我底心旌就感到非常的不和和苦痛！</p>

<h3 id="c244">春哥伯 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 阿樂</p>
<p>鄰家的春哥伯，人們呼之曰怪物。他的年紀，雖則已近花甲，頭髮也蒼白了，但精神卻還很健旺，要是你喜歡跟他談天說地，就是一整天他也不會些微顯示疲倦的神態來。不過，也要給他看得上的人，他才有那麼地興致，可是，有時就是給他看得上的人跟他談話，他也會默不一言地坐著，或呆呆地站著，讓你一個人儘管向天獨白。</p>
<p>因為是這樣地一個人，所以跟他合得上的，自然也就很少，何況億又是上了年紀的人？</p>
<p>他時常孤獨地到野外閒步，在一棵參老的松樹下，默默地徘徊著。等到夕陽西墮，宿鳥歸林的時候，他才緩緩地踱因家裹，晚上，他就一定要喝酒，而且一喝就要喝個醺醉。</p>
<p>就在這個時候，要是走進他的唯一的靜房，你就必得默默地坐在那兒，讓他先開口，不然，他會老不客氣地把你滾出門外去。</p>
<p>有一次，正當他剛從野外回來的晚上，我闖進他的房裹去，閉著嘴坐在那兒看他喝酒。</p>
<p>他呷了一口，把酒杯放下去，停了一忽又拿起來呷，似有所思地睜圓著眼珠，瞧著桌面。</p>
<p>驀地，他跳了起來，拍著桌子，忿怒地說：</p>
<p>［媽媽的！］</p>
<p>但立刻他又好像說了這一句之後，才發覺有人坐在他的房裹似的，隨卽恢復了常態，薄笑地說：</p>
<p>［喝酒？］</p>
<p>［不會的。］我答道。</p>
<p>［不會喝酒，才是　　　的大。］</p>
<p>［不見得吧。］</p>
<p>他依舊微笑著。坐下去，拿起了酒杯，又呷起酒來。</p>
<p>這一次，不知怎地，他特別地少開口，要是在往日那他不消說是會滔滔不絕地撥揮他的偉論，或罵天咒地，把滿肚子的牢騷，都借著酒吐露出來。然而今晚，他卻異乎尋當地冷靜，我也覺得太沒興趣，告亂了他離開他的家裹。</p>
<p>幾天後。我從學校回歸家裹，則踏進門，弟弟好像很迫載似的告訴我說：</p>
<p>［春哥伯死了。］</p>
<p>我驚訝地呆了半響。弟弟難續地說：</p>
<p>［前天下午有人看見他坐在往日喜歡坐的那棵松樹下，時而號啕大哭，時而哈哈大笑，他這種舉動，人們是看慣了的，所以也就沒人去留意他。那裹想到他會在那兒死呢！據說他的死屍還抱道破那查松樹不放。</p>
<p>春哥伯是死了，春哥伯臨死抱著那棵松樹的事情，到了現在卻還沒人猜得透其中的原因。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個商店的小職員，近來遭遇得很多矛盾的的現象，使我非常煩惱。所以特犠牲一小時的很珍貴的睡眠時間來寫這封信教你，希望你給我一個指示。</p>
<p>在這強鄰欺凌的時代，一般人都在設法抵禦，努力求國工作，為抵制仇貨等等。但我們訓裹的經理先生，卻鉤心斗角的想倫運仇貨，以圖厚利。同時，同行中如已運進了某種自已沒有的仇貨，他就非常著急，深恐不能興彼爭利。卽使有人罵他一聲奸商，他總是微笑著說［是，為商必奸］。在良心上來說，國難臨頭，不應為虎作倀，但根據事實而論，一個老間為了生存，當然要設法圖利。我現在是一個小夥計，［良用取於斯，必當忠於斯，］然而忠了店事，同時又違背了良心。這種矛盾的環境，呌我息樣應付呢？務請先生賜予解答為盼。警請</p>
<p>撰安　　羣聲上</p>
<p>編者按：在這個時代裹脅，一切都充滿了矛盾的現象，於是一般青年便因愛矛盾的包圍，和現實的打擊而感覺到非常的痛苦了。羣聲君所說的一個矛盾的生活，可說就是一部份人的代表。</p>
<p>但是編者認為假使我們能夠認清矛盾的實質，則此種現象反可增加我們對於時事的認識，增加我們的悲憤，增加我們積極準備打破矛盾的決心興勇氣，這就是克服矛盾，而不為它所克服了。假使你受了矛盾現象的痛苦，但又不知怎樣去認識它，克服它，你只有終日受痛苦的包圍，無法擺脫，你就成為環境的俘虜，永遠不能自拔！</p>
<p>關於一般商人沒有國家觀念，在這國難日深的時期，倫運仇貨而圖利，乃是整個政治不上軌道，民族精神不振作</p>

<p>的反映。對於此事如從小處說，可選擇機會，隨時用正當手段裁制這些奸商。但從大處著想，應注意整個政治外交的動向，要從事全民族的準備，方能消滅這種不好的現象。憤慨悲哀，消極茍安都於事實無補。</p>
<p>本著這個意思，編者認為羣場君如能暫時忍耐。可繼續服務下去，等待將來的機會，只要本人不直接購運仇貨，對良心是無愧的。否則只有另謀發展；不過在沒有找到其他職業以前，也不必過於感覺悲憤，因為我們已經說過，單是悲憤是不能補、實的呀！</p>

<p>— 漾漾</p>
<p>那差不多是不可信的，一個用性感在舞臺上或銀幕上號召觀衆的女女，她的私生活有許多地方，竟是老式的女太太們所不能完全做到的。但是那卻不可否認的事實。她常和人說：［論到我的私生活，我不怕和任何女子的私生活比較一下。］她到了好萊塢三年之久，但是一班尖鼻子的，好事的新聞記者們，至今沒有找到她有何可議之處，如果你始終不信她是好萊塢的一個最前進的清凈教徒的話，我們儘可以將許多一九三四年的流年罪惡，一件一件的來研究一下，到底那一條罪名，是可以套在梅蕙約的頭上的。有人說，搶人家的丈夫，是今年是可恨的一椿罪惡。但是梅蕙對絲於別人的丈夫，是看都不看的。她會說過：［別的人女子的男子，無論他是丈夫，或是未婚夫，或是男朋友，我決不會和別人爭奪的。當然，已經和妻子離婚的男子，是在這裹面的。雖然愛情一件事，是和戰爭相近的。兵不厭詐，愛情之中，當然亦有劇烈的競爭，但是你們要記得，天下儘多單身的男子任你挑選，所以又何必謀奪別的家產呢？］</p>
<p>或者造謠生事，是現在第二個最大的罪惡。就是一等大明星，亦免不掉和三朋四友，交頭接耳地，議論她敵對明星的隱秘之事。但是梅蕙絲，卻是最反對干涉到人家的陰私。她的待人接物，一秉至公，而對待一切老朋友，尤屬情至義盡。她自已亦會說過：［誰要向我說我的朋友的壞話的，我一定不會相信的。反之，我亦決不會向別人說人家的壞話。我從我個人的經騐，知道那是最不公平的一件事。自從我到了好萊塢之後，報紙上亦不知道登了許多不好聽的話。那都是毫無根據的。第一件事，他們總說我是有丈夫的。我聲辯得都不要再聲辯了。］所以，她對於造謠生事的人，最為痛恨，而遇見人家二朋四友，交頭接耳，鬼鬼崇崇的時候，她亦早就走開，從來沒有參加過一次。</p>
<p>勢利和薄情，亦是許多明星們犯的通病。他們對於從前的老朋友，在他們未發跡的時候，就很親近的，或則有功於他們的，會經幫助過他們的，他們闊了之後，就避之若凂了。梅蕙絲卻不是那種勢利小人。許多在舞臺上，或銀幕上，成過名而後來失敗的藝員們，現在仍舊不斷的受她的資助，其中有一個從前很有名的歌星，現在還由梅供給著生活費，住在好萊塢。</p>
<p>其餘的小罪惡，如虎偽裝假等等，尤其是一般普通明星所難避免的。可是梅，有人說，她或者就是好萊塢最誠實的一個女子。她自已對於這件事的觀察法是：［我做一件漂亮的事，聰明的事，並不是因為那件事做了是漂亮的聰明的。我是隨我心之所好，求我心之所安。反之，許多人家以為做了漂亮的事，我卻因為性情不近而不支做。譬如歌劇，我卻從來不喜歡去看。要是有人真心喜看歌劇，那又是一說，但是去看歌劇的人中，有一部份的人是實在並不喜歡，不過要到歌劇場中露臉，給人家看看而自以為漂亮罷了。以我自已而論，我喜歡看的是門拳，我不管人家的議論，我想去看就去看了。］和這個相似的，就是一切無謂的應酬，梅亦是一概不肯參加的，無論於她的事業有沒有影響。她素來不［要政治手腕。］她亦從來不以罷工的方法，來要挾加薪。她覺得反叛，不是她做的事。就是至大的罪惡如懶惰，她亦絲毫沒有。凡她不在攝影場工作的時候，她的時間，都耗在著作上的。她編著小說，戲劇，歌曲。她亦天天練習唱歌。她從來不到夜總會去玩，亦不作無聊的事支渠消磨光陰。最後，她的勇敢是極可佩服的。她的珍飾被竊之後，她接到許多恐嚇信，呌她不許告發，否則於她的性命不利。但是她終究告發了，並且親自到法庭作證。所以法官亦說；［祇要人人都像梅蕙絲那樣敢作敢為，天下的罪惡，就可以減去一半了。（完）</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>The　Barretts　of　Wimpole　Street—南京</p>
<p>像這樣的影片，自然是相當值得推寫的，至少，我們在這裹可以窺探出美國電影藝術之高度的發展。</p>
<p>為了對於這一影片得有比較深刻的認識，我們不能忽視在維多利亞女王時代社會的動態。當產業革命之後，初期的資本主義的意識形態，開始對建勢力爭門，自然這是歷史的決定意義之解釋。就詩人夫婦白朗寗（Robert　Browning）和伊利沙白（Elizabeth　Barrett）來說，在他們的青年時代，一方面固然遭受封建勢力之殘酷的茶毒，自覺的成為封建的反叛者，同時他們也若干程度的看到了勞働者痛苦呼聲。特別是從［孩子們的呼號］(Crying　of　Childen)　一時中，我們便可知道伊利沙白確是一個怯懦的覺悟者。當然，正確的說，在那個時代，他們還夠不上是一個前進詩人，然而也不足落後者。</p>
<p>從這一方面來就，我們看劇作者寫伊利沙百作為一個怯弱的反對建的女性而存在，從家庭暴（她的父親）的身邊脫逃出來，而渴望自由朗寗結合，無論如何是接觸現實了的。在這裹我們看到𢍠萊佛蘭克林(Sidney　Frankin)除了正面的描寫之外，還相當的用了象微的手法，如巴雷（即伊沙白的父親）幾次的關閉窗戶，使房中黑暗，牠把女兒幽閉起來，又如伊利沙白掙扎著跑向窗前，對著冬天的陽光歡笑，當她和白朗寗歡敘之後此外，我們再看他是怎樣正面的描寫對封建勢力之濃厚興殘酷，怎樣來描寫那家庭魔君之兇惡的：當巴雷入門，一隻小狗立刻逃生原處。三女兒享利泰和情人在雪中幽會，嚇得那般可憐的樣子。當巴雷發現了三女兒有了愛情，他殘暴的威逼她不準再和那軍官來往。當巴雷逼著伊利沙白離開白朗寗走回房去，導演以俯攝的時候。</p>
<p>除了上述的種種之外，我們不妨再看他對於青年詩人熱戀描寫罷。可不是麼？一個少女到底是需要愛情的，家庭的鐵練並不能縛住少女戀愛的熱情。和白朗所說的［我愛你，我永遠不能離開你］一樣，伊利沙白和白朗寗定情之第，她的宿病霍然而愈，她說：［我不能死，我不要死，］她開始了生命的活躍，為了愛的光輝。這和她看見窗外朦朧的月色和雨的點滴而絕望的大聲痛哭，恰是極好的對比。同樣，三女兒享利泰也有著為愛而犠牲的決心。在這裹我們看得到，作者是將愛情的部份十分強調起來的。關於這一部份，其優秀的場面，有白朗寗將入臥室時，伊利沙白十分驚喜的整理被褥，在公園中歡敘的柔情等等，都是非常好的描寫。</p>
<p>然而在我們要求現實主議的場合中，這一影片是否非常正確的電影藝術的地描寫當時之現實的呢？我們覺得還是相當不夠的。假使劇作者是勇敢的現實主義者，他將十分著重在新興舊的思想働突上，勇敢的發輝反對建的光輝。則是在這裹卻是加重了巴雷變態性格的描寫，他使巴雷不準女兒出嫁，完全是因著自已妻子的私奔而對愛情憎恨，同時在父女之間還加上超過父女之愛的慾念，結果是父親所以反對女兒出嫁，並不是強調的新舊意識形態的衝突。</p>
<p>當然我們並不說世間上沒有如此的父親，不過這不是一般中最顯著的代表，即是說決非典型的描寫。因此，由於這一方面的加重，便削弱了反對建的正面的描寫，這不免是一種遺憾；雖然我不會忽視封建的巴雷借重了宗教的力量對兒女們極端壓迫而引起她們的積極反動。</p>
<p>不必說，在這裹展開了電影藝術在美國之最高度的發展，這是一種值得驚異的光輝。這固然是導演佛蘭克林的手法太好了，而每一個演員能夠隨心所欲表現出來，以至於攝影的優美，自不待言。如嚴格的說，我以為飾三女的瑪琳奧沙利文（Maureen　OSullban）的演技是在弗列克馬區之上的。</p>
<h3 id="c252">評［龍潭寶鑰］ <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>首先，由於最近給我們接二連三地年了幾張偵探影片，而且多是平庸流谷，簡直無聊的偵探片子，我們得特意地來略為說述關於這類片子的話。</p>
<p>本來，因為偵探故事本身的富於戲劇性，在比較嚴肅的態度興高明的手法之下，是可以構極完美興較有意義之作品的。這裹的所謂意義，應該放在對於不尋常的事件而科學的地思維興探求得解決之啟智的教育方面。</p>
<p>可是晨近我們所見到的偵探片子是怎樣的呢？從［空廈飛屍］，［舊金山箱屍案］，以及［霧夜飛屍案］到這個［龍潭寶鑰］，墢論在成果方面，或意義方面，距離我們所希望於偵探影片，以及偵探片子所應該興可能達到的程度都太遠了。本來，在把電影作為供給飽食暖衣者的消遣品之一，除［生意經］之外不必要什么藝術—即使要也只要怎樣便於消遣得更好，更夠味—的製片商們手中，電影作品的庸俗，固然不是從瞧見探影片方面單獨表現出的。可不是嗎？勉強地佈置一個案件，勉強地來一個解決，再硬生生地穿插此男女之間的愛情制份，藉以調劉一下在死傷刦奪之餘的沉悶空氣，不是足夠有閒者們兩小時的消磨嗎？</p>
<p>說到［龍潭寶鑰］的本身，興比它先前映出的偵探片子沒有多少不同。只是前者是用室內機關，箱子，車子，飛機等作為故事的關鍵，即這［龍潭寶鑰］卻是換了個陰森森的古潭為劇本的主要背景，以便利用演員的泳術興壯健的身本，給某些觀衆一點滿足而已。至於用一個鑰匙來作為解決的工個，這和別的片子的使用別的什么全沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>偵探片原是以它的特殊性，事跡離奇，經過曲折，結構嚴密見長的。這個片子也敘述了由於金錢愛情等足以演成殺人案的事情，可是在書畫上我們全然看不到殺人犯有殺人的必要。應有的曲折，緊張，興變化，在這兒也並不充份。</p>
<p>偵探明星華倫廉在這個片子中，恰如片子內容所決定他的一樣，沒有能力表現出一個大偵探家的那種獨到的地方。其餘的演員也只是平平，對於這樣的劇本總算是稱職而已。</p>

<p>— 文印</p>
<p>自從那個風雨凄其的日子過去經後，沒有多少年，裴德麗絲已經名聞全國，稱為美國的浜格餅大王了，而蒂里拉的面容，印在每一包的浜格麺粉包皮上，就成了一個偉大事業的高標了。蒂里拉自已對於金錢，是很置之度外的。除掉對於披歐拉的將來，和她自已的身後之事，她差不多不知道金錢有什么用處。她但求能夠為她心愛的裴小姐服務。她堅持著，一定要為自已為裴小姐料理一日三餐。裴體諒她忠心耿耿，早已提了一筆欵子，用蒂里拉的名字存在銀行裹。那筆欵子，已經足使蒂里拉經濟獨立而有餘，祇要她自已要享受那種獨立。當然，裴亦沒有忘記那位大功臣，愛爾墨史密斯。………光陰荏苒，條忽憶到了蒂里拉浜絡粉發生的十年紀念日。裴特為在蘇頓房子裹開了一個宴會。愛爾墨那天作了酒吧間的主席。裴四面卻圍繞著一般欣羨她的男子。她穿著華貴的晚服，真是光彩奕奕，愈顯得她體態的苗條，以及她皮膚的光緻。一回兒，裴德麗絲逃避了一班包圍著她的男子，跑到陽臺上去透透空氣。她要自已一個人清浄一下。她站的地方，正對著前門。她看見一個人在門外蹀蹂來住著，好像尋找什么東西似的。他忽然抬起頭來，看見了裴的影子。他瞪著眼看了一回，忽然笑著問道；［真可笑，我怎麼找不著門鈴了。你曉得不曉得，那東西到底是藏在什么地方去了？］他正說著，大門忽然開了，一個客人走了出去，他和他擦著肩膀走下去了。那個要想進來的人，就笑著向裴點點頭道：［好了，好了，我可以進來了。］裴覺得很奇怪，她走了下去，問看門的那個生客是誰，但是看門的亦不知道。她要避開他，他好像是進來找什么人似的。但是她一掉過頭來，那位先客已經站在她的面前了。她當她好似老朋友的看待，毫不客氣的招呼著她道：［哈囉……我進來了。］裴給他這麼一招呼，突然楞住了。她囁嚅著道：［哦，你進來了。］那人又說道：［真奇怪得很，那個門鈴到底在什么地方，你知道不知道？我恐怕那個門鈴，一定是鑫銅鑽嵌的，所以到了晚上，主人就把它藏在保險櫃裹去了。總有一天，我白天來一趟，看看那門鈴到底是什么樣子的。］裴給他這麼一說，不覺好笑起來。這個人，她覺得有一種特別的風味……差不多像……香檳酒一樣的。於是他們就好像舊相識似的，開始交談起來。等到音樂一響，他們二人就覺得極自然地摟抱著跳起舞來。裴在和他跳舞的時候，才知道他的名字呌史提芬阿契爾。他是愛爾墨的朋友，並且是愛爾墨約他今天和裴德玉絲見面的。等到一次跳舞完畢之後，史提芬去替裴取冰水去。在這個時候，愛爾墨斯經尋到了他。愛爾墨跟在史提芬的後面，好像和他爭執著什么東西似的。祇聽見史提芬道：［我告訴你我沒有工夫去和她相會，愛爾墨。我現在正忙著呢。］這個時候，他們二人已經走到裴德麗絲的面前。愛爾墨一把拖住了史提芬道：［哈哈她就這裹……你來見見她，不管你願意不願意］史提芬抬頭看著裴德麗絲的臉，半晌說不出話來。忽然他狂笑起來：［哦……哦……哦……哦……原來你就是……裴不等說完，就接了下去道：［浜格麺粉大王。］她說著，亦就哈哈大笑起來。愛爾墨看看裴，又看看史提芬，然後問道：［怎麼？你們早就認識了嗎？］但是裴不說什么，就推著他走開了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Second Day of Air Defense Drill Emphasizes Passive Measures <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Planes Drop Bombs, Buildings Burn</p>
<p>Firefighters Strenuously Conduct Rescue</p>
<p>Tear Gas Released on the Banks of the Qinhuai River</p>
<p>Chiang Summoned Drill Commanders for Instructions</p>
<p>Nanjing – The capital's air defense drill continued on the morning of the 22nd, with an emphasis on various passive air defense measures. The drill included fire fighting, poison gas defense, public works, and rescue exercises. The details of the morning's events are as follows: Early in the morning, a simulated squadron of enemy aircraft approached the capital in two routes, one along the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line and the other along the Yangtze River. After a certain observation post spotted the enemy aircraft, it immediately reported to a certain commander. The alarm system issued an air raid warning at 8:00 a.m. The city's military police, Boy Scouts, transportation agencies, and civilian groups, organized into large teams for security, fire fighting, poison gas defense, and public works, were deployed in sections. Anti-aircraft artillery units were on standby to be dispatched. Soon, the enemy aircraft approached the capital, and at 8:30 a.m., the alarm system issued an emergency warning. Sirens and alarm bells resonated throughout the city. Security teams implemented traffic control, prohibiting vehicles, horses, and pedestrians without permits from passing. Moments later, a large squadron of enemy aircraft flew into the airspace over Nanjing from the southwest with a buzzing sound, at an altitude of approximately 3,000 meters. Our anti-aircraft artillery fired, but the enemy aircraft dropped dozens of bombs in a very short period, causing widespread damage to Nanjing. A red signal representing an incendiary bomb was dropped on the public sports field, and a pre-built building in the field caught fire, with flames raging. Several residents jumped from the windows, and rescue teams rushed to catch them with canvas. Fire fighting teams also arrived to extinguish the fire, first using sandbags and then water. Civilians also participated in the rescue efforts, and the fire was quickly extinguished. White signals representing explosive bombs were dropped in Xinjiekou, damaging the pre-installed water pipes, power lines, and roads. Water sprayed everywhere, and utility poles were knocked down. Water, road, and power line engineering teams worked diligently to repair the damage, completing the repairs in half an hour. Green signals representing poison gas bombs were dropped at Confucius Temple and Xiaoying. Members of the poison gas defense team, wearing gas masks, released smoke screens and tear gas, creating a dense cloud of white smoke along the banks of the Qinhuai River and the Xiaoying training ground. They then used water and bleaching powder to disinfect the area. Many citizens gathered to watch. A section of power line at the Central Hospital, a utility pole on the eastern section of Guofu Road, and a section of railway track near Xiaoying were also supposedly damaged by enemy bombing. Road, telephone, and telegraph teams repaired the damage within half an hour. After the enemy aircraft dropped their bombs, there were no more planes in the sky over Nanjing. The all-clear was given at 9:30 a.m., and the city returned to normal. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>The Nanjing capital air defense drill involved simulated enemy aircraft attacking the capital four times from morning to late evening on the 21st. The drill included traffic control, light control, aerial combat, and anti-aircraft operations, with an emphasis on the military's active air defense. At noon on the 22nd, simulated enemy aircraft attacked for the fifth time, with the drill focusing on fire fighting, poison gas defense, and rescue, emphasizing civilian passive air defense. The results were satisfactory, and the sensational large-scale drill came to an end. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Nanjing – At 4:00 p.m. on the 22nd in Nanjing, Chiang summoned the commanders of the air defense drill units for instructions. Those present included He Yingqin, He Yaozu, Gu Zhenglun, Chen Zhuo, Huang Zhenqiu, Cao Baoqing, and over two hundred others. Huang Zhenqiu first reported on the drill's progress, followed by comments from He Yingqin and He Yaozu. Chiang then gave instructions, expressing his hope that all personnel were satisfied based on the various reports. He Yaozu, Gu Zhenglun, and Chen Zhuo praised the efforts of the unit commanders and personnel of various organizations who participated in the drill, noting their diligence in performing their duties. A banquet was held for all personnel at the Lizhi Society at 7:00 p.m. on the 22nd, and the event concluded after 8:00 p.m. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Nanjing – After the conclusion of the air defense exercise on the 22nd, Huang Zhenqiu, director of the Nanjing Air Defense Department, reported on the radio, stating that due to economic and time constraints, as well as concerns about realism, the facilities were not fully complete, which was a major shortcoming in the drill and would be even more dangerous in actual combat. Therefore, he said, we must not be satisfied with such a simple drill if we want to strengthen the capital's air defense. The capital's air defense equipment is still in its infancy and requires active effort. He also noted that this drill was an innovation, and many civilians lacked practical experience, standing on the streets to watch the spectacle. He asked whether people would be so calm if enemy planes were actually dropping bombs. Therefore, after an air raid emergency alert is issued, people should rush home to make various defenses or preparations for refuge and should not crowd the streets and alleys, which is contrary to the requirements of actual combat. He hoped that special attention would be paid to correcting this in future drills. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Nanjing – Soong Mei-ling left Shanghai by Ford aircraft at 10:00 a.m. on the 22nd, arriving at Ming Palace Airport at 11:45 a.m. Before the Ford aircraft arrived in Nanjing, Chairman Chiang inspected the Lizhi Society from the military academy residence. Upon hearing of the plane's arrival, he went to the airport to greet his wife and returned to the military academy for lunch. At 4:00 p.m., Chiang summoned the commanders and visiting representatives who participated in the air defense exercise at the military academy, offering words of encouragement. He expressed satisfaction with the drill. In the evening, he hosted a dinner for American Minister to Russia, Mr. Bullitt, and invited the heads of various ministries to attend. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Nanjing – On the 22nd, during the capital's air defense drill, the Gendarmerie conducted a harassment and suppression exercise in seven districts: southeast, northwest, central, Xiaguan, and Pukou in Nanjing, achieving good results. 1. Harassment and suppression exercise: At 4:00 a.m., the exercise was conducted at predetermined locations in each district. The rioters wore red armbands, two-thirds carried weapons, and the rest were unarmed. The South District aimed to destroy [Redacted], the West District aimed to destroy [Redacted], the Central District aimed to occupy [Redacted], the East District aimed to destroy [Redacted], the North District aimed to attack [Redacted], the Xiaguan District aimed to destroy [Redacted], and the Pukou District aimed to destroy [Redacted]. They rose up in riot, each district was fully armed, each carrying several fake bombs (ashes wrapped in paper bags), wearing armbands on the left arm, and fake sandbags (straw wrapped in burlap bags) were set up as bunkers at important streets and intersections. After several hand-to-hand combats, the enemy was defeated and fled. Those who played the role of the injured and dead were excluded, and those captured were sent by car for investigation. Both sides looked tense during the exercise, as if it were actual combat. 2. Assembly and suppression exercise: At around 10:00 a.m., each district performed, the unarmed rioters used red armbands as markers, and started a demonstration from the predetermined location. The armed gendarmerie in each district ran to the venue and dispersed them in different ways, arresting the leaders. 3. Indoor arrest exercise: It was extremely wonderful at [Redacted] at 9:00 a.m. Beforehand, more than 30 rioters in disguise secretly gathered in the [Redacted] auditorium. When they were found, more than 100 soldiers were sent to surround [Redacted], and [Redacted] entered the encirclement from the east, south, and west roads. All the rioters were arrested. In the afternoon, indoor arrests were practiced in [Redacted] and other districts, and the situation was very good. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Nanjing – Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd from Shanghai. He went to the military academy to meet Chiang. At 4:30 p.m., he went to the Yuan to handle official business and met with various secretaries, inquiring about the work situation. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Nanjing – Yu Youren arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd from Shanghai by overnight train. Important officials of the Control Yuan welcomed him at the station at Hepingmen. He then went to his private residence in Gulou to rest. He said that he had been recuperating in Shanghai and that he was now recovered. Furthermore, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was approaching, and he needed to discuss matters with the central government. Therefore, he returned to Nanjing for a visit.

Society was terrified, as if facing a great disaster. You have rectified the army, carefully planned great strategies, and used the steady approach to control the elusive bandits. You personally inspected the positions, and your command was decisive. Our anti-bandit soldiers have followed orders without interruption, seeing danger and fighting bravely, charging and fighting, changing seasons, and walking through the rugged and unhealthy areas, eliminating the bandits who harmed the country and the people. In recent months, various cities have been successively captured. Since the fall of the Red capital Ruijin, the bandits have lost their footing, and good news has been frequently transmitted, causing joy throughout the country. We are all gratified to hear that Jiangxi and Fujian are gradually being cleared. It is our soldiers'功牺牲 for the country that has initiated the opportunity to reverse the chaos.

<p>Nanjing – Regarding the Ministry of Industry's request for interpretation of ambiguities in the Company Law, the Judicial Yuan's Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference resolved as follows: The first point of the original submission pertains to legislative intent and is not within the scope of interpretation. Secondly, Article 28, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law only refers to unlimited liability shareholders of the company, thus judicial shareholders are not subject to restrictions. Thirdly, unanimous shareholder consent is inherently unsuitable for joint-stock companies; compliance with Article 186, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law is sufficient for matters requiring unanimous consent. Fourthly, Article 19 of the Company Law Enforcement Regulations, which stipulates mandatory withdrawal, refers to instances where unanimous shareholder consent is not obtained. While there are no penalty clauses for violating Article 28, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law and Article 19 of the Enforcement Regulations, they remain legal restrictions. Regarding the Zhejiang Provincial Government's previous request for interpretation on the jurisdiction of ownership confirmation cases, the Judicial Yuan's interpretation was telegraphed back to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating that if the disputed land has been deemed government property by the administrative authorities and subjected to valuation and public sale, the party claiming ownership may initiate a petition procedure. However, if the party separately files a civil lawsuit seeking confirmation of ownership, the judicial authorities may not suspend the legal proceedings and proceed directly with the trial.

<h3 id="e23">The Implications of Italian-Austrian Consultations on the European Political Situation <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Desired.</p>
<p>Since the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou in Marseille, the European situation has once again undergone significant changes. The Hungarian government, suspected of instigating the Marseille tragedy, dispatched Gömbös to engage in widespread activities. Gömbös personally visited Poland, a steadfast opponent of the Eastern European Pact, seeking to establish a triangular alliance between Warsaw, Berlin, and Budapest to bolster their position. He then embarked on a tireless journey to Rome and Vienna, engaging in extensive and confidential discussions. His mission is not difficult to discern. Recently, Yugoslavia, relying on France and Czechoslovakia for support, threatened to appeal to the League of Nations in Geneva. Meanwhile, Italy and Austria, following Gömbös's activities, repeatedly convened in Rome, advocating for an enhanced role for Austria in the Danube region. At this juncture, Czech Foreign Minister Beneš was the target of an assassination attempt. Beneš, as a diplomatic figure from a small nation, was highly regarded. Although he narrowly escaped becoming a tool of manipulation by major powers, unlike the Yugoslav King, the assassination attempt serves as clear evidence of the animosity directed towards the Little Entente countries. In other words, certain anti-Versailles states are attempting to further dismantle the French franc bloc.</p>
<p>We believe that the crisis in today's European political landscape hinges on control of the Danube and competition in the Balkans. The situation is strikingly similar to that of 1914, with the only difference being the varying relationships of alliances and coalitions. Austria traditionally held a prominent position in the Danube and Balkan regions, and its territory has long been a contested area. With the expansion of financial capital after the war, Vienna became a gateway for the intrusion of major powers into Central and Southeastern Europe. At a time when Franco-German animosity is deepening, the Roman government's eagerness to forge unity among Italy, Austria, and Hungary, and even to elevate Austria's status, is seen as a crucial tactic to undermine the satellite states surrounding the French franc bloc. As for threatening the pro-French and anti-Italian movements in Southeastern European countries, that is merely incidental.</p>
<p>However, that is not all. Since the downfall of the Doumergue cabinet in France, the core of its political power remains in the hands of the Radical Socialist Party, led by Herriot. The continuation of negotiations on the Eastern European Pact after the appointment of the new Foreign Minister Laval, and his indication that Poland's ratification of the pact is not entirely hopeless, demonstrate this. Although Laval's comments inevitably surprised Warsaw, the direction of French diplomacy clearly shows a confrontational stance against Rome. If Hitler does not engage in a desperate struggle against Italy, the conflicts between France and Italy arising from the struggle for influence in Central and Southeastern Europe are unlikely to be resolved for the time being. If Italy takes a step further and expands the Italo-Austro-Hungarian Protocol established in March of this year, then a transformed development of the Polish-Hungarian cultural agreement and the German-Polish non-aggression pact may also be within expectations.</p>

<p>Bolibo - According to a report from Harbin, a security guard unit of the Chinese Eastern Railway intercepted a batch of military supplies at the Uteschimi (phonetic) station on the eastern section of the railway due to the lack of a waybill. The supplies included twelve Japanese-made firearms, four German-made firearms, and four thousand five hundred rounds of ammunition. Soldiers from the 28th Regiment stationed at Ashi River Station unloaded the supplies. Railway police detained both the supplies and the soldiers and drafted a report, which was immediately reported to superiors. However, the commander of the security guard, upon learning of this, ordered the release of both the people and the goods. Subsequently, around 10 PM, several unidentified individuals moved the military supplies into the deep mountains. (TASS Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Differences Between the United States and Japan Difficult to Resolve</p>
<p>British Mediation Unlikely to Succeed</p>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Simon and Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira held talks for one hour and fifteen minutes. Tonight, the British side's pessimism regarding the outcome of the British-American-Japanese naval talks has diminished slightly. The talks were of a friendly nature, and although there is no expectation of resolving existing differences, it is widely believed that the meeting was beneficial. There seems to be hope for continued discussions, and the process may be prolonged. Therefore, the sentiment among well-informed circles in London is more optimistic than before. The critical situation of the naval talks was one of the issues considered at this morning's cabinet meeting. British and American representatives have scheduled a plenary session, possibly on November 12th or 13th. (Reuters Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London - Representative Matsudaira visited Foreign Secretary Simon at 2:45 PM on the 21st and explained in detail, based on instructions from Tokyo, the reasons for not accepting Prime Minister MacDonald's proposed compromise. Foreign Secretary Simon, based on the important cabinet meeting of the 21st, revealed the British plan to avoid a breakdown in the conference and requested the Japanese side's consent. However, Japan's rejection of the British compromise plan is considered final, leading to the complete closure of prospects for the conference. The British propose continuing naval relations without a treaty and without limitations for one or two years after Japan announces the abandonment of the existing treaty, and then proposing the renewal of the current treaty at an appropriate time. This opinion is gaining traction. (Dentsu Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London - This morning, Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira met with Mr. Strang of the British Foreign Office to discuss the procedures for the next meeting between British and Japanese representatives. The talks lasted for an hour. After the meeting, it was learned that the date of the next meeting had not been determined, and it was also unclear whether the next meeting would require the full attendance of British and Japanese representatives or only the attendance of Matsudaira and British Foreign Secretary Simon. It is generally believed that British and Japanese representatives will continue talks early next week. (Reuters Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>London - Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham tonight, in which he mentioned the naval talks, stating that if the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan could reach an agreement, peace could be maintained in the Pacific for the next twenty years. He also stated, "A naval arms race is both meaningless and wasteful of resources, which we can certainly avoid. However, if we want to avoid competition, we should compromise with other countries to achieve success. But if we volunteer and say to other countries, 'No matter what happens, no matter how other countries act, Britain will never strengthen its naval forces,' then the hope of success will be slim."

<p>Peace and Non-Resistance as Tenets</p>
<p>Advises Against Involvement in the Far East Vortex</p>
<p>Washington - The American Friends Service Committee today wrote to President Roosevelt, urging him to accept Japan's proposal to abolish offensive warships. The highest tenets of the organization are peace and non-resistance. They strongly advocate that the United States should abandon any interference in the relationship between Japan and China. The letter also stated that the reason the United States maintains sufficient naval strength in the western Pacific is to prevent Japan's aggression against China and to protect American interests in China. However, the damage caused by China's independent resistance against Japan is incomparable to the damage caused by triggering a second world war. Moreover, the United States' involvement in the Asian conflict may not necessarily reduce the suffering in Asia. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e28">American and Japanese Suspicion and Competition: Negotiations Face Many Difficulties <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The preliminary talks at the London Naval Conference have now entered a most difficult stage. Since the Tokyo government has reiterated its original position without making any concessions, the only hope for reaching a compromise on the issue of naval ratios lies in a change of attitude by the United States. However, it is uncertain whether the United States can make concessions. The United Kingdom continues to exert its mediation efforts and, in view of the current situation, is striving to maintain the other parts of the Washington Naval Treaty (i.e., provisions other than the 5:5:3 ratio), such as qualitative limitations and the prohibition of strengthening fortifications in naval bases within the Pacific. Regarding the first point, the Japanese delegation declared yesterday that qualitative limitations could only be considered after the right to naval equality had been obtained. This statement was quite surprising, as Japan has always advocated for the reduction of specific tonnage (i.e., Japan advocates for the reduction of warships with offensive capabilities). Until now, Japan has hoped to reduce the operational capability of American warships so that they would not be able to reach the China Sea without increasing fuel. As for the Japanese Navy, there is no intention of operating far from its bases, so its warships do not need the ability to leave their Far Eastern bases and travel across the oceans. Therefore, Japan had originally strongly supported qualitative limitations, but now it has made the opposite statement. Observers suspect that this is a tactic used by Japan to prevent Washington and London from reaching a bilateral agreement on total tonnage and ship types. However, the United Kingdom remains hopeful that Japan can still be persuaded on this point. This point will be discussed at the Anglo-Japanese meeting scheduled for early next week, at which time Japanese Rear Admiral Yamamoto will present Japan's views on the technical aspects of this issue. If Japan, in principle, agrees to a compromise to stipulate the maximum tonnage of each ship type, then Prime Minister MacDonald must again seek the consent of the United States. However, there is no certainty about the attitude of the American government. Regarding the political provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty (i.e., not increasing fortifications in naval bases within the Pacific), the United Kingdom and Japan believe that if they are attached to the qualitative limitations compromise, the maintenance of these provisions will not be a problem. Conversely, the United States finds it difficult to agree. People in that country have declared that when the Washington Naval Treaty was originally signed, the United States acknowledged not increasing fortifications in the Pacific in exchange for Japan's concessions on the naval ratio. Now that Japan is unwilling to maintain the original ratio, the provisions regarding fortification in the Pacific cannot continue to be extended. In such a situation, the naval conference will inevitably encounter major difficulties even if the ratio issue is disregarded. (Havas Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Tokyo - A semi-official announcement issued here this morning to clarify Japan's position in the London naval talks stated that Japan would frankly refuse to raise the issue of Far Eastern politics put forward by the United Kingdom, even if it meant withdrawing the Japanese delegation. The announcement refuted the argument that the Washington Convention and the Nine-Power Treaty are interrelated, and then stated that if the Nine-Power Treaty is continued and the territorial integrity of China is re-guaranteed, then the independence of "Manchukuo" or at least the establishment of "Manchukuo" must be recognized. Japan firmly believes that there is no need to discuss the "Manchukuo" dispute anymore. Japan insists that the current talks in London and the conference in 1935 can only consider naval issues. Japan is very willing to consider concluding bilateral agreements with the United Kingdom and the United States, but absolutely opposes multilateral agreements. (Reuters Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London - A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy declared to the press today, opposing the raising of political issues at the London naval talks, stating that discussing political issues would make the conference more complicated. The spokesman also stated that Japan hopes that the navies of all countries will become purely defensive in nature. Therefore, Japan advocates the abolition or limitation of battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers, as Japan wants to reduce the navies of all countries and then realize quantitative equality. If the naval conference fails, Japan is very willing to avoid a naval arms race, but if a competition occurs, Japan will never lag behind. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>

<p>Only Takes Caution in Dissemination</p>
<p>Washington - Navy Secretary Swanson today denied that he had issued an order to strictly maintain secrecy regarding news of naval events. This rumor arose because news reporters found that the Navy Department was suddenly lacking in information, and it was almost impossible to obtain news from various offices. It is true that Navy Department officials have always been cautious about disseminating information, and in recent times, they have been even more vigilant against espionage. News reporters who want to obtain information must travel to various offices, go through several telephone calls, and cannot obtain any information without the approval of the highest-ranking officials. However, Swanson still stated today that the relationship between the Navy Department and the press has always been satisfactory, and there will be no changes in future policies. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington - Yesterday's telegram stated that Navy Secretary Swanson signed several orders strictly prohibiting the leakage of naval information. Swanson has now denied this, stating that the existing orders regarding this matter have been issued for a long time and are sufficient to protect all secrets, so there is no need to issue any further orders.

<p>Air Minister Considers It a Top Priority</p>
<p>Any Plan in Cooperation with Autonomous Regions</p>
<p>London - At today's meeting of the House of Lords, the competition between British and Dutch airmail routes to the Far East was discussed. Some members advocated for increased speed and night flights. Air Minister Lord Londonderry replied that the Air Ministry was not asleep. Many criticisms of British aviation services are based on foreign aviation performance data and figures, which are often inaccurate. We must not blindly pursue speed and implement excessively hasty plans. Any plan for imperial air transport must be closely coordinated with autonomous regions and colonies. The time is not yet ripe to present all the details. Soon, an aviation plan with higher speed and more frequent flights will be drafted. The Air Ministry met nine months ago to consider purchasing the excellent Dutch Douglas aircraft, and then decided to purchase American aircraft. Although the government can now provide more generous financial assistance to British air transport, its aim is still to place it on a solid commercial footing. We do not seek to be ostentatious. The subsidies received by commercial airlines are lower than those of other countries, and their performance is better than that of any other country. During the debate, Imperial Airways announced that its imperial airmail passenger services, from London to Karachi in the east and Johannesburg in the south, will be doubled, with flights twice a week. Starting December 30th, flights from London to Johannesburg will depart every Sunday and Wednesday. Starting January 1st next year, flights from London to Karachi will depart every Tuesday and Saturday. The new regulations also stipulate that the aviation service from the United Kingdom to Egypt will operate four times a week. (Reuters Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>High-Speed Bombers Capable of Traveling Between Berlin and Paris</p>
<p>Allocates 3.5 Billion French Francs to Improve Air Force</p>
<p>Paris - French Air Minister Denain attaches great importance to Germany's establishment of seaplane bases for air routes to South America. He gave a five-hour speech before the Aviation Committee of the Chamber of Deputies on this matter, stating that this plan is currently being discussed among the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, with the hope that the issue of opening international air routes between Europe and North America can be resolved in the near future. The original American initiator is also seeking patent rights, while the United Kingdom wants it to become an international undertaking. French aircraft manufacturer Blériot is paying close attention to this matter, hoping that a satisfactory solution can be reached among the three countries. The Air Minister also said that French pursuit aircraft will be developed to a high speed of 400 miles per hour, so that France's new bombers can carry a load of 1,000 kilograms and travel back and forth between Paris and Berlin. As for seaplanes, the situation in France is very unfavorable, and it is hard to compare with Italy, which has 2,000 new-style seaplanes. Therefore, France needs 3.5 billion French francs to improve its existing air force. Of the originally stipulated aviation expenditure of 900 million French francs, 500 million French francs have already been used. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Paris - French Air Minister General Truant today refuted the alarming rumors that Germany has thousands of military aircraft before the Aviation Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, stating that Germany will have approximately 1,000 to 1,100 aircraft by the beginning of next year.

If the French Air Force is completely reformed, it will cost approximately 330 million francs. The budget reporter will likely allocate 100 million francs from the supplementary national defense expenditures to the Air Force to make up for the inadequacy of regular expenses.

Germany has recently ordered aircraft engines from the United Kingdom and the United States, with a total value of several million British pounds. In addition, there are large orders to German specialized factories and new aircraft manufacturing plants. Achard then read out the French Army budget, requesting an allocation of 5,689,000,000 francs, not including the cost of border defense projects. In the morning, the French Army expenditure was 5,946,000,000 francs. (Reuters Dispatch, 21st)</p>

The amount of compensation will be discussed after experts from both countries arrive here tomorrow.

<p>Reiterating the Establishment of a Permanent Peace Organization</p>
<p>Geneva - Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, delivered a speech at the plenary session of the Disarmament Conference here. Litvinov stated that the reason for the stagnation of the Disarmament Conference's work is that all countries, large and small, have failed to agree to fulfill various restrictions and obligations on disarmament. At the same time, this situation still exists today, so although the resolutions proposed by Henderson are valid, it is impossible to adopt them with limitations. Furthermore, regarding the issue of arms sales and manufacturing submitted by Henderson for discussion, Litvinov stated that the Soviet representative does not oppose it, because the Soviet Union does not have private arms sales or manufacturing. Therefore, this restriction has already taken effect in the Soviet Union, and he hopes that other countries can do the same. At this point, Litvinov suggested that the announcement of information should not be limited to the sale and manufacture of arms, but should also include the transport of arms. Henderson suggested forming a standing committee for disarmament. Litvinov believes that establishing it would be like "putting the cart before the horse," because this committee, no matter how eloquent, would be powerless in the near future. Therefore, adding it would be like legitimizing its inaction. The Soviet delegation then proposed forming a special organization with a broader mission and a permanent peace conference format, which would handle all issues related to creating security and peace guarantees. Therefore, Litvinov suggested that the plenary session should discuss Henderson's proposal to form a standing committee and the Soviet proposal for a permanent peace conference at the same time. Litvinov stated that if Henderson could agree to this point, he could withdraw his opposition to Henderson's proposal. (TASS, 21st)</p>

<p>Advocating the Establishment of a Federal Government to Replace Centralization</p>
<p>Defense, Diplomacy, Finance, and Banking Still in the Hands of the Viceroy</p>
<p>Great Impact on the British Empire and Relations with the Far East</p>
<p>Will Trigger New Developments and Combinations East of Suez</p>
<p>London - The Indian constitutional reform report published by the Joint Committee today is the most important document in the history of the British Empire. Its suggestions may lead to future autonomy for the Indian government. The report advocates the immediate establishment of an All-India Federal Government consisting of eleven provinces and several departments to replace the current centralized government. However, several important issues related to the lifeline of India, such as finance, defense, and diplomacy, will still be under the jurisdiction of the Indian Viceroy. Most observers believe that this is the greatest freedom that Indians have long opposed British rule and is the beginning of establishing an autonomous government in India in the shortest period of time. What impact this move will have on the relationship between the Empire and the Far East is still unpredictable, but it is generally believed that its impact will be significant and may trigger new developments and combinations east of Suez. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>London - The content of the Indian constitutional reform Joint Committee's report, which is eagerly awaited by the general public, was released this afternoon. This move marks the completion of the most difficult task of studying and revising the constitution in the history of the British Empire or even the world.</p>
<p>The report advocates replacing the current centralized government system with an All-India federal system including autonomous units. The eleven provinces of India belonging to Britain (two of which will be newly created) and the princely states of India will form a federal system. The princely states will join the federation voluntarily. The internal administrative system of the princely states and the relationship between the princes and monarchs outside the scope of the federation will not be changed. However, the provinces will govern their own affairs on a larger scale than at present. Most of the administrative departments involving individuals, including laws, security, and certain taxes, will be the responsibility of the provinces. The federal government will manage matters related to the entire Indian body, such as currency and tariffs. Defense and foreign affairs will still be the direct responsibility of the Viceroy. Each province will have a legislative council, which will be elected by direct suffrage. Voters account for about 14 percent of the population. Five provinces will have both upper and lower houses. The federal government will have both upper and lower houses, which will be composed of those indirectly elected by the provinces and those designated by the princely states. The federal and provincial parliaments will both stipulate seats for various ethnic minorities. The executives of the federal and provincial governments are responsible to the parliaments, which is the same as the system in which the British cabinet is responsible to the parliament.</p>
<p>London - The Indian constitutional reform Joint Committee's report also advocates that the Governor-General and provincial governors should adopt the opinions of the cabinet members when their opinions do not conflict with certain special responsibilities entrusted to them by the constitution. The scope of responsibility of the Governor-General and provincial governors is quite broad, such as preventing harm to peace and security and protecting ethnic minorities, all of which are within their responsibility, and the Governor-General is also responsible for ensuring financial stability and credit. The report pays special attention to the issue of terrorism and makes special proposals. The federal and provincial governments should have a parliamentary government system unless the environment requires the Governor-General or provincial governor to exercise their special powers. The report advocates that Indian civil and police personnel must be recruited in Britain and proposes measures for police protection and discipline, and measures to ensure judicial independence from political influence. The report also has protective measures for British trade to prevent India from using its economic freedom to harm British trade through tariffs. The report finally recommends separating Burma from India and having the same constitution. The majority of the committee members agreed with the report. In the final vote, only three Conservative Party members, one Labour Party member in the upper house, and three Labour Party members and two Conservative Party members in the lower house expressed disagreement. The report of the committee is slightly different from the White Paper in terms of safeguards, such as any legislation concerning police discipline must be agreed to by the provincial governor, and reports on the activities of terrorist parties must be instructed by the provincial governor and must not be announced to outsiders. The provincial governor has the power to accept any administrative department in order to eliminate terrorist acts. Madras, Bombay, Bengal, the United Provinces, and Bihar will establish upper houses. The Indian legislature will have the right to petition for amendments to the constitution concerning the organization of parliament and suffrage ten years later. After the separation of Burma and India, a separate commercial treaty will be established. As for the appointment of judges, it will be in the charge of the High Court. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e45">British Parliament Will Conduct Detailed Research and Begin Debate Before Christmas <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>London - British Prime Minister MacDonald moved in the House of Commons that the time of all members of parliament during this session must be used to discuss the report of the Indian constitutional reform committee and the Indian bill to be proposed by the government. Today, the House of Commons passed this motion by a vote of 224 to 62. The Prime Minister said that the Indian bill contains 300 articles and the government will spend most of its time on this. The debate on the report will be held before Christmas, and the second reading of the Indian bill will be held after Christmas and before Easter. From Easter to the end of July, most of the parliamentary time will be used for detailed discussion of various articles of the Indian bill. The Labour Party members of the Joint Committee submitted another report, advocating that the structure of the new Indian constitution should enable India to achieve the status of overseas autonomous territory through internal development procedures, without the need to request approval from the British Parliament again. It also said that safeguards are necessary, but they should be for the purpose of protecting the people from being abused. The Labour Party members expressed serious opposition to the establishment of the two houses of the legislature, saying that the provinces of India may well be allowed to try it according to the Westminster system, but the central responsibility should be exercised by a committee of the legislature composed according to the Ceylon constitution. There should only be one central legislature, in which the Labour Party should have 26 seats, and the Governor-General should not have the special responsibility of ensuring financial stability and credit. Ford of the Liberal Party expressed the Liberal Party's views on this report, saying that the Liberal Party representatives who participated in this committee opposed the election of the lower house of the central legislature from a direct system to an indirect system, fearing that this change would greatly disappoint the Indian people. But in general, the Liberal Party representatives agreed with the report's proposals, and the Liberal Party in the House of Commons and the country will definitely support this case, as it is a great advance in the autonomy of India. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London - The draft reform of the Indian constitution proposed by the government will be studied by a joint committee of the two houses. After 18 months of work, the committee has completed the report, which was released this afternoon. This document is of great importance to the future of the British Empire. Its content fully recognizes the government's draft, but puts forward three reservations, which are directly in line with the views expressed by those who criticize the government's draft. The points reserved in the report are: 1. All laws concerning police power must obtain the consent of the provincial governors before they are implemented, and the provincial governors are the representatives of the King of England. 2. Whenever it is necessary to suppress terrorism, the Indian government has full power to supervise any part of the administrative affairs. 3. It is firmly advocated that the Governor-General of India has the power of veto if it is proposed to tax goods transported from the UK mainland to India. The above three items are the main reservations, known as safeguard clauses, which the Conservative Party wants to include in the constitution. With the committee's report in hand, it is easy to understand the content of the government's draft and engage in research. Parliament's discussion of the government's draft will be carried out in three stages and will last for about five months. After the draft is passed in principle, a line-by-line discussion will begin. At least the last few months of this session will be devoted to line-by-line discussion. It can be seen from this that the UK and public opinion attach great importance to the reform of the Indian constitution. All members of parliament regard India as a symbol of the prosperity of the British Empire. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Covering Up People's Eyes and Ears to Hinder Autonomy, Indian Public Opinion Expresses Great Dissatisfaction <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>New Delhi - Indian public opinion on the report of the Indian Constitutional Reform Committee has condemned the committee for failing to adopt the concept of autonomy in overseas territories, and pointed out that the constitutional provisions it has drafted are harsh and difficult to develop. However, with the exception of the extreme faction of the National Congress, all political parties understand the need to use their acquired powers to promote social and economic progress by proposing legislation in accordance with constitutional procedures. It is generally believed that this report exposes the weaknesses of the constitution, especially the two-headed political system in the center. It is generally said that this system will prevent the development of genuine and spontaneous cooperation between the British and Indian peoples. The Indian National Congress agency Minsheng (民聲) claimed that the fear of the Indian Liberal Party that the mixed committee would be subdued by the radical faction in Britain has now been proven to be correct. The rare shadow of responsibility contained in the White Paper is now becoming increasingly illusory due to the retrograde proposals in the report. In fact, it is just shelving the Indian issue. The Indian people now hope that the British Labour Party will take power so that this constitution can be amended as soon as possible. Sapru, a Liberal Party member of the Indian Executive Council, told a Reuters interviewer that the reforms proposed in the report have failed to satisfy any aspect of public sentiment. The British Liberal Party had proposed a plan for direct elections in the center, but it was rejected, causing the original plan in the White Paper to lose its only advantage of being able to influence the people. The proposed reform plan has abolished the central democracy system and is only a move to cover up people's eyes and ears. It not only wants to consolidate the existing interests of Britain, but also wants to hinder progress towards autonomy. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

Xiao Zhen is determined to accompany them. Chen stated that this trip to Nanjing will involve detailed discussions with Princes Xing Yun and De about various issues in Inner Mongolia. The discussions were extremely harmonious, and the past divisions between the Central Government and Inner Mongolia have been completely eliminated. Although a certain party occasionally sends vagrants into Mongolia to intimidate, they have no official representatives to present any conditions. In the past three months, no one from that party has been active in Pangjiang and Bailing Temple. According to my own assessment, that party currently has no concrete plans. However, a few vagrants are trying to find a way out by enticing and attempting to gain merit. Therefore, the various rumors circulating outside are all due to a lack of understanding of the true situation in Inner Mongolia. The Inner Mongolian princes and nobles, having witnessed the manipulation of Eastern Mongolia by a certain party, are quite shocked. Under such circumstances, how could there be any intention of surrender? The rumors circulating outside are simply not credible. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

This morning, the securities market opened with mixed results. Railway stocks are still under pressure. The price of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad stocks fell by 1 pound. The decline in public utility stocks has stopped. American Telephone and Telegraph opened up by 1 pound. Except for railways, other stocks showed a slight improvement. Also, railway stocks were under pressure yesterday, and public utility stocks were suddenly uneasy, so everyone expected the opening of the securities market to be sluggish and uncertain. However, overnight sentiment was good, and this morning's opening market was mixed. Railway stocks started to fall again today, with prices falling by more than one dollar, because everyone expected that the number of railway freight cars this week would decrease by more than 10,000. Today, public utility stocks were being bought, and it is believed that several industrial stocks are currently in a position to rise in price. Opening transactions have decreased significantly compared to recently, causing the market to become sluggish again. The New York securities market prices are listed on the left:</p>

<p>Unprecedented Disaster in a Decade</p>
<p>National Harvest of Fifty Million Koku</p>
<p>The natural disasters in Japan this year have been extremely severe and have spread throughout the entire country. The drought in Kyushu is already serious enough to put the local rural areas in a very difficult situation. The windstorms in Osaka, Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, and Kyoto Prefecture, while not fatal blows, were not minor injuries. The frost damage in the northeastern prefectures of Aomori, Fukushima, Yamagata, Miyagi, Akita, and Iwate is particularly severe, transforming a relatively modern rural area into a state before the Middle Ages. The sale of daughters is almost an open transaction—said to be worth ten yen per year of age. The average farmer is in a state of malnutrition. In the rural areas of the northeastern prefectures, only two or three out of ten families have white rice to eat. The rest eat coarse grains, and the worst even chew on grass roots.</p>
<p>Moreover, the actual harvest is worse than generally expected, even worse than estimated by many agricultural experts. Since the initial estimate of 57 million koku of rice this year, the Kansai region has been hit by a major windstorm during the rice flowering season, resulting in significant losses. In addition, the climate in various regions has been very cold, unsuitable for the maturation of grains, further reducing the harvest. In fact, the harvest is 20.08 million koku less than last year (a decrease of approximately 28%), with the actual harvest only being 50.746 million koku. This is still an estimate and not a definitive figure based on actual facts.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago (1913), Japan experienced a major disaster, with a total national harvest of 50.259 million koku. At that time, the average harvest per tan (approximately 1.488 acres) was 1 koku 5 to 9 sheng 5 he. Before that, in the 43rd year of the Meiji era (1910), the average harvest per tan was 1 koku 5 to 8 sheng 1 he, which was the lowest recorded in Japan in recent decades. However, at that time, agricultural technology was not advanced, the grain varieties were poor, there were many shortcomings in cultivation, and fertilizer application was not optimal, so the harvest was naturally low. Recently, agricultural technology, while still in a handicraft state, has reached the highest level of handicraft. In particular, cultivation has been thoroughly improved, and major tasks such as fertilizer application and seed selection have made great progress. Furthermore, the area of cultivated land has also increased annually. From 1929 to last year, the average harvest for five years was 62.573 million koku. Compared to this year, the amount of the decrease is truly alarming.</p>
<p>In terms of the situation in each region, using the average figures for the past five years as a standard, Hokkaido has a decrease of 15.4%, the six northeastern prefectures affected by frost damage have a decrease of 40%, the seven Kanto prefectures have a decrease of 15%, the four Hokuriku prefectures have a decrease of 19%, the three Tosando prefectures have a decrease of 14.4%, the three Tokai prefectures have a decrease of 16.6%, the six Kinki prefectures have a decrease of 14.7%, the five Chugoku prefectures have a decrease of 11.4%, the four Shikoku prefectures have a decrease of 23.9%, and the seven Kyushu prefectures have a decrease of 18.2%. Only Okinawa Prefecture (the former Ryukyu Islands) has an increase of 53%. Among the six northeastern prefectures, Iwate Prefecture has the most severe decrease, accounting for 58.9%, making it the worst-harvesting area in Japan. Next is Aomori with a decrease of 46.7%, Yamagata with a decrease of 39%, Miyagi with a decrease of 38%, Fukushima with a decrease of 36.4%, and Akita with a decrease of 25%. Looking at this situation, Japan may be like the United States. Due to the reduction in the harvest, the general rural economy may actually improve significantly.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there are currently more than 16.389 million koku of rice stored in Japan. Adding this year's 50.746 million koku and 13 million koku of imported rice, the consumption budget is only 71 million koku. Even after removing the estimated 5 million koku that is too high, there is still a surplus of 3.7 million koku. The reality is probably not as good, because among the 16.389 million koku currently stored, the government holds more than 11 million koku, which cannot be eaten freely by the people. Even if the Japanese government sells it to the people at a lower price, the effect of the transfer will still be limited, and the food shortage in the rural areas will remain severe.

<h3 id="e107">The Six Counties of Southern Jiangxi Are Designated as a Special District <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>—Implementing the "Three Chiefs" System to Teach, Nurture, and Defend—</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Ruijin, Shicheng, Yudu, Huichang, Xingguo, and Ningdu, six counties in southern Jiangxi, have been occupied by bandits for six or seven years, also known as the so-called Central District by the Red bandits. Except for Xu Huichang, which is still occupied by the remaining bandit forces, the rest have been recovered one after another. However, these six counties have been occupied by the bandits for a long time, and the red influence is deep. Social organizations and human relations have been completely overturned. Economic structures and production functions have also been almost completely destroyed. The people's minds have been anesthetized by the bandits, and their actions have been controlled by the bandits, all of which have become deeply ingrained and difficult to reverse. Therefore, for these six counties, special political means should be used to make urgent corrections, in order to eliminate the toxic bacteria, allow them to breathe and recuperate, and gradually restore their vitality to achieve restoration. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specifically ordered the Jiangxi Provincial Government to designate these six counties as a special administrative region, devoting all its efforts to suppressing the remaining bandits, providing relief to the disaster-stricken people, and carrying out self-sufficiency and self-defense work. After receiving the order, Xiong Shihui, in consultation with the relevant departments, drafted the outline of the special district's administrative program, implementing the "Three Chiefs" system of principals, township heads, and Baojia heads as instructed by Chiang Kai-shek, focusing on education, nurturing, and defense. Principals promote special education to correct people's hearts; township heads manage rural economic organizations to provide a livelihood; and Baojia heads train the people to enable them to defend themselves. Then, they engage in construction to achieve the goal of restoration. Those who have already been put into practice include Xie Shouru, the magistrate of Xingguo County; Ma Yaoxiang, the magistrate of Ruijin County; Shao Hongji, the magistrate of Ningdu County; Li Yonghuai, the magistrate of Yudu County; and a certain county magistrate of Shicheng County, all of whom have taken office and are working. Wang Youlan and Shao Hongji, the special commissioners of the Tenth and Twelfth Districts, have also personally gone to Xingguo and Ningdu counties to work.</p>
<p>After returning to the province from inspecting Shicheng and Xingguo, Director Lü Min of the Civil Affairs Department will set off for Ruijin to supervise everything. Relief personnel from the preparation meeting place and the emergency relief shelter, as well as the medical and treatment teams providing medicine at the anti-epidemic office, are also departing one after another. More than ten sets of cotton clothing collected from various circles have been successively transported to Shicheng, Xingguo, and Ningdu for distribution. The Special Education Department of the General Headquarters has also established a special education promotion office for the six counties in Ningdu, appointing Wen Xingxiang as the director, and selecting 24 graduates from the second phase of special teacher training to go to various counties to run public schools. In addition to completing the Yongfeng to Gulonggang and Guangchang to Shicheng lines, the Highway Department also plans to complete the highway plan for the six counties, forming construction teams to set off for construction.

<p>Heading to Hunan to Preside Over a Prayer Ceremony for Peace</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Norlha Khutughtu, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, accepted the invitation of He Jian, the head of Hunan, to go to Changsha to preside over a prayer ceremony for peace. He arrived in Hankou from Beijing on the 20th and stayed for several days. The threshold of those who went to worship was worn through. He often used chanting and stroking to cure people's illnesses. When the reporter visited, he was granted an audience and talked about his experiences in Kangding, maintaining the five-race republic, and escaping from prison in great detail. He also explained the differences between the Exoteric and Esoteric schools of Buddhism. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>The Bloody Battles in Western Sichuan: I was originally in Western Sichuan, named Zha Ka Lama, one of the great Living Buddhas of Western Sichuan. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Zhao Erfeng, the Qing Dynasty's resident minister in Tibet, attacked the black sect rebels and suffered repeated defeats. Because the black sect followers harassed everywhere, I volunteered and quelled the rebellion in one fell swoop. Emperor Xuantong granted me the title of Grand Director-General. After the founding of the Republic of China, there was no strength to take care of the border areas. The Dalai Lama was tempted by the British to plot rebellion and destroy the five-race republic. I was the first to oppose it, which led to armed conflict. From the first to the sixth year of the Republic of China, we fought bloodily for six years. The Dalai Lama used British-style guns and cannons, and his strength was stronger. Peng Ersun, under the command of Chen Xialing, the garrison commander of the Sichuan border, had also defected. Our side had no way to call for help and gradually became unsustainable, leading to defeat and retreat. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, the Dalai Lama imprisoned me in a Tibetan prison. I managed to escape after several years.</p>
<p>Escaping from the Tibetan Prison: After escaping from the prison, I traveled at night and begged from door to door, receiving people's offerings. Later, I met a woman who donated a sheepskin coat, which saved me from hunger and cold. I safely escaped to India. Coincidentally, a woman had a strange disease, which I cured, and she gave me a thousand pounds of gold. Only then did I transfer to Hong Kong and take a ship north. It was in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. Duan Qirui took power and sent a telegram inviting me to Beijing, where he supported me, giving me a monthly salary of a thousand yuan. Except for living expenses, I donated everything to charity. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, I went to Sichuan and stayed in Chongqing for four years, establishing the Sichuan-Kang Advancement Association. Recently, I went to Beijing.</p>
<p>Exoteric and Esoteric Buddhism: Buddhism has Exoteric and Esoteric schools. Generally speaking, the Exoteric school holds fasts and is vegetarian, while the red and yellow sects of the Esoteric school do not. In fact, holding fasts and being vegetarian is Taoism. Buddhist teachings only prohibit killing, and there is no prohibition on eating meat. Raising and eating meat is not killing. Moreover, according to Buddhist rules, monks can eat three kinds of pure meat: one, not seen; two, not heard; three, not suspected. Therefore, not eating meat is only a special prohibition, not a universal precept. On the contrary, those who study the highest Esoteric school consider not eating meat to be a violation of the precepts. Everyone can learn the Exoteric school, but the Esoteric school is more difficult. For example, Bodhicitta is the soil, the Exoteric school is the tree, and the Esoteric school is the fruit on the tree.</p>
<p>Treating Diseases Without Medicine: People's diseases are mostly caused by karmic retribution. I use my mind to generate compassionate thoughts, silently chant mantras, and then stroke the patient. Naturally, they can be cured without medicine. However, if the patient is not sincere, I am not sure. Performing empowerment and transmitting the Dharma is nothing more than eliminating disasters, resolving difficulties, and increasing wisdom. In particular, the Amitabha mantra and the Manjushri mantra have incredible effects.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Strange News of a Corpse Transformation in the Old Capital <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yan Yuting Dies for Twelve Days</p>
<p>Dead During the Day, Alive at Night, Breathes on People</p>
<p>Those Breathed On Often Become Half-Crazy</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: The saying of corpse transformation is seen in ancient books and unofficial history notes, described in great detail, as if it were indeed true. In recent years, as scientific knowledge has gradually reached the people, although the legends in rural areas still mix in tales of gods and ghosts, it is rarely found in metropolitan commercial ports. Unexpectedly, in the residence at No. 23 Bingmasi Lane, Nanluoguxiang, outside Di'anmen in the northern city of Beiping, there is a strange tale of corpse transformation, dead during the day and alive at night, spreading throughout the old city. The reporter went to investigate in person and recorded the situation witnessed as follows:</p>
<p>The deceased's name is Yan Yuting, 69 years old this year. He was a house manager in the residence of a high-ranking official, so he lived in leisure in his old age and was quite well-off. His son, Yongde, suffered from hemiplegia and all medicines were ineffective. Recently, he also developed phlegm congestion. Thirteen days ago (the 19th), he died of suffocation due to phlegm. He died in the morning. His family prepared a coffin and burial items. Unexpectedly, one day after Yan's death, at night, he suddenly opened his eyes, gasped, and spoke loudly. However, his tone was clearly not his own. At first, they suspected it was phlegm congestion, temporary shortness of breath, or that he had come back to life. However, Yan had died and was ice-cold, and his whole body was stiff, completely a dead corpse phenomenon. In terms of facts and experience, there was absolutely no reason for resurrection. Moreover, he spoke nonsense. After one night, at dawn, he suddenly lay on his back, stiff, ice-cold, and dead. At night, the same phenomenon as the first time was repeated. His son was helpless and prayed to the local land temple, which is the most superstitious in the lower class of society. When he returned home from the temple, he was also muttering to himself, like a neurotic, showing the same strange state as his father. The deceased's wife begged four strong men from her neighborhood to come to her house to keep watch at night. Unexpectedly, before the end of the night, these four men shouted and opened the door to escape. The corpse jumped up and wanted to get up, chasing after them madly, breathing on people they met. A certain old woman in a neighboring courtyard happened to be walking towards the corpse. After the corpse blew on her face, the old woman immediately went into a frenzy, using both hands to support the ground, making her feet stand upright in the air, like the martial artist's so-called "handstand." The neighbors in the same courtyard felt uneasy because Yan's family's corpse had turned mad. Counting that the corpse had been dead during the day and alive at night, continuously making noise, for thirteen days. Everyone was helpless, so they jointly reported it to the police station. Duan Wenxiu, the patrol officer of the 19th section of the 5th district, led the police to investigate. Indeed, they saw Yan's corpse still lying on the pit. Yue Zuomin, the household registration officer who came with him, used a flashlight to shine on the dead man's face. Unexpectedly, the dead man's eyes suddenly opened with it, and at the same time, he made a gesture to get up, and blew air towards the police officer's face. The police officers present were alarmed by this strange sight and were on guard. They reported to the Public Security Bureau. The Bureau has now notified the newspapers not to promote the gods and monsters claiming corpse transformation, and should consider it a residual state of dying from phlegm congestion and shortness of breath after not dying for many days. However, Yan Yuting has not yet officially died, and the strange phenomenon of being dead during the day and alive at night, with a cold and stiff body and speaking loudly, continues to be performed unabated. It is said that this matter is worthy of special study by scientists and the medical community. (19th)</p>

<p>Fei Gongxia, the captain of the county's water patrol team, cracked down on three kidnappers, Shen Yuda, Xia Ayun, and Xu Aba, at Shen Shousheng's house in Yinglong Temple, Punan, the night before last, and rescued three hostages. After interrogating them, it was learned that the bandit leader, He Amei, had recently been arrested by the Fengxian County Government. The team then recorded their confessions, prepared a document, and submitted it to the county government for legal action. Based on the situation, the county government has already dispatched team detectives Ji Haishan and Tang Shuqin to lead armed police officers, carrying documents to Fengxian to escort the bandit leader He Amei back for legal action. They should arrive in Songjiang tomorrow. In addition, ten escaped bandits in this case have also been completely rounded up by Xu Pucheng, the district chief of the Shanghai Water Police Team, in Bugao Lane on Ya Yupei Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>Chen Ziyun and Chen Shunjin, father and son, who are grave keepers surnamed Zhao in Mudu Township, gathered fellow villagers the day before yesterday and severely beat many Jiangbei boatmen. As a result, the Jiangbei people angrily attacked the grave hall. Chen immediately opened fire with his home-made guns to defend himself. In the end, due to the large number of Jiangbei people, Ziyun was outnumbered and fled. His son, Shunjin, was beaten to death by the Jiangbei people. After the incident, the Jiangbei people dispersed in a crowd. The villagers in the area were very indignant and jointly searched for the Jiangbei boats. They found nine Jiangbei boats in Yangjia Port, Xikuatang, and shot at them with home-made guns. For a time, gunshots rang out, and the situation was dangerous. Fortunately, the Mudu District Office nearby received the news and immediately notified the Public Security Bureau to send police to stop it, and detained the Jiangbei boats, detaining thirty-two Jiangbei men and women at the Mudu District Office. The disturbance was then quelled.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Collection Fees for Land Tax Must Not Be Shared <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance believes that the collection fees for land tax in various counties should be entirely allocated to the expenses of the Land Tax Collection Office. The collection fees for deed tax and official document fees should be entirely allocated to the expenses of the Promotion Office and the Deed Tax Office. With fixed expenses in each of these offices, handling public affairs is easier, and the staff in each office can be allocated salaries, which can encourage honesty. However, it has recently been found that some counties are accustomed to old habits, often regarding collection fees as a special income, dividing and sharing them, putting them all into private pockets, which in turn causes the expenses of each office to be stripped away, and the salaries of the staff are not paid at all. This not only hinders the progress of public affairs, but also makes it impossible to prevent the staff from engaging in private malfeasance. This is a great loss to the original intention of the Department to rectify the collection methods in various counties. Yesterday, it specifically issued a notice to all counties, requiring that all the above-mentioned collection fees must be collected and allocated as much as possible, and allocated separately to the expenses of each office. The responsible personnel of each office should still prepare receipts for the amounts collected and allocated, and the county government should fill out expenditure vouchers and hand them over to the accounting director for registration and verification. In the future, if the amount collected is found to be inappropriate, it will be treated as private malfeasance, in order to clear up long-standing malpractices and maintain official integrity.</p>

<p>In the case of the dispute over the waste weir dam between Gushan in Jiangyin and Chenyi in Wuxi, the people of Gushan opposed the compromise plan of the Construction Department to rebuild the culvert, and Zhou Mianren and others filed an appeal with the provincial government. The provincial government approved the rejection and set a time limit for legal rectification. After Zhou and others received the approval, they rectified the procedures and submitted them to the provincial government for verification. According to the report, the provincial government stated that since the procedures had been rectified within the time limit, the Construction Department should be allowed to legally defend the appeal and send the files to the government for further verification. Yesterday, another instruction was issued to Zhou and others to inform them. However, the people of Gushan are still taking a tough stance. They said that if there is no result, they will continue to appeal to higher authorities, and will not stop until the bridge is built.</p>

<p>Weng Suying, a silk-reeling worker at the Minfeng Silk Factory in Yaozhuangbang outside the South Gate, who is twenty-two years old, suddenly brought Ying Liansheng, a tinsmith, to the Third Public Security Bureau, accusing him of rape, and Huang Fengdi, a young sister, testified with her at the bureau. The branch bureau submitted the case to the General Bureau, which transferred it to the Local Court yesterday. At about 4 p.m., Prosecutor Ren Guanghai opened the court for investigation. Weng spoke eloquently and calmly described the situation of being raped, with no shame or coyness. When asked of Ying Liansheng, he firmly denied it. The questioning official then ordered a forensic examination in court. Upon hearing this, Weng immediately took off her pants and allowed the examination. It was found that her hymen had been broken, confirming that she had been raped. The court ordered Liansheng to be detained, and Weng Suying and Huang Fengdi were ordered to return.</p>

<p>Magistrate Hou Houzong of Wujin County appointed representatives Gao Bozhen, Chen Yingsun, and Zhou Jiping at the county administrative meeting to go to the province on the 20th to petition for issues such as disaster relief. The three representatives, Gao Bozhen and others, returned to Changzhou that evening. Magistrate Hou returned to Changzhou on the 21st. It is reported that the result of Magistrate Hou's petition with the representatives is that for the 334,200 mu of grain-less fields in the county, a complete exemption of 300,000 mu has been approved, and those affected by other disasters will receive a general reduction of 10% (previously, the fixed plan was 33%). According to this calculation, the county's land will be levied at 70%. Director Zhao instructed that there should be no changes in the future. Therefore, after Magistrate Hou returns to Changzhou, he still needs to convene local people to discuss and decide.</p>

<p>This summer, Guzhaiji in Lianshui was once attacked and robbed by bandits, and local merchants and the district chief, Zhang Tingfu, and others were shot and killed. Shen Jinghua, the county chief, received an order from the provincial government to arrest a bandit named Guo Xiaoguanzi in this case. After interrogating him, it was learned that there were still many important criminals hiding in Xiba, Huaiyin. County Chief Shen brought patrol officer Wang Dongchu and the bandit Guo to Huaiyin on the 17th, and consulted with the Huaiyin County Government to dispatch more than 30 teams to search Xiba before dawn on the 18th. Guo identified Wang Shaowu, Chen Youfu, Chen Ligong, Wang Fushen, and others, as well as Wang Shaowu's concubine, Zhang San Guniang, and escorted them to the Huaiyin County Government.

<p>For the convenience of planned traffic on the Liuyang Highway, it has been determined to build a navigable drawbridge in the canal outside the South Gate of Yangzhou. Now, with the winter water dry and the canal water level low, it is planned to take advantage of this opportunity to start construction. However, water traffic must be temporarily cut off. A special letter has been sent to the county government to announce to all sailing vessels to detour at that time to avoid the danger of running aground and delaying the bridge construction project.</p>

<p>Jiaxing County Government believes that the amount of overdue taxes owed by the people is quite large. This year, due to the severe drought, the tax revenue of land has been affected, causing problems with the regular expenses of various agencies. Now, in compliance with the provincial order, a committee to urge the collection of overdue taxes has been established. Wang Chunong, Zhang Ximin, Gao Derun, Li Sen, Shen Dazhi, and others have been appointed as members. Since the 12th, the members have been dispatched in teams to cooperate with the tax collectors to collect taxes from wealthy households who owe overdue taxes, starting from the urban area. It has been verified that Wang Chengbo, Jin Dizhong, and other major debtors are being strictly urged to pay. In accordance with the provincial regulations on the collection of overdue taxes, the deadline is set at three and a half months, until the end of February of the 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>The Jiaxing branch of the Red Swastika Society has designated the four townships of Northeast, Southeast, Guantang, and Zhengyang in the fifth district as disaster relief areas.

It has gone to Shanghai to purchase 1,800 bags of flour and distributed them at the fifth district office in Wangdian on the 21st and 22nd (the Southeast and Guantang townships were distributed on the 21st, and the Northeast and Zhengyang townships were distributed on the 22nd). Each adult in a disaster-stricken family received 30 pounds, and each child received 15 pounds. Each person also received a set of cotton clothing. This amount is calculated to provide disaster-stricken people with one month's worth of food. However, whether or not it will be issued next month depends on whether the funds can be raised.</p>

<p>After arriving in Shanghai from Japan on the 19th, Dr. Espinoza, the Vice President of Nicaragua, has been very busy with social engagements for several days. Yesterday morning, he visited the City God Temple and the Public Education Hall in the Confucius Temple. The municipal government sent Secretary Geng Jiaji and others to accompany him.

<p>This Victory Is Indeed an Opportunity to Revive the Nation's Foundation</p>
<p>The Failure to Achieve Final Victory Requires Continued Efforts in the Future</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed yesterday to express condolences to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the soldiers of all armies suppressing bandits. The original text reads: "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Nanchang Military Headquarters: The Red bandits have been rampant for seven years, and the Gan River basin has been poisoned almost everywhere. In addition, foreign troubles have taken advantage of the situation, and during the rampant period, they have almost grown out of control. The Central Plains was shocked. Your Excellency wielded the axe to lead the expedition, carefully planning in silence, not seeking immediate success, but focusing on changing accumulated habits and boosting morale. As a result, the defenses of Linhuai were completely renewed, the soldiers were dedicated, and the common people were pleased. Eventually, they were able to use more support to defeat less support, and the old nests of accumulated years were rescued. The people celebrated their revival. This is probably due to the divine calculations of Marquis Wu, who attacked the mind, and the fortunate diligence of the soldiers who fought a hundred battles, both of which combined to achieve this great achievement. Compared with the former Generals Li and Zeng, who supervised the army to suppress the Nian rebels, building long walls and clearing the people's villages, the effect of siege and encirclement was similar, but the efforts were even greater. The entire business community of Shanghai is grateful for Your Excellency and all the soldiers' hard work, and they are also celebrating that this victory is an opportunity to revive the nation's foundation, which was about to be destroyed. Therefore, they dare to send a telegram to express condolences to the soldiers and to show the gratitude of the people. If it is approved, please inform all the armies and share this intention. However, the remnants of the bandits have escaped, and a large-scale pursuit is required. The failure to achieve final victory requires continued efforts in the future. With Your Excellency's wisdom, there will be ways to comfort the people's hopes. With sincerity and dedication, we only ask for your consideration. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>

Mao completed his public affairs in Beijing and came to Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd to visit Finance Minister Kong and pay a visit to the Bank of China, so that after the bond is approved, he can negotiate with the Shanghai banking community for loans.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Signing of the Huai River Grain Contract <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>More than Ten Purchasing Manufacturers</p>
<p>Transported by Dada Company</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, due to the Huai River Guidance Project, has specially entrusted the Jiangban Provincial Farmers' Bank to handle the transportation and sales of grain. The bank has signed a contract with the Shanghai grain industry and Dada Shipping Company is responsible for the transportation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process: Since the start of the Huai River Guidance Project, all workers' grain has been entrusted to the Jiangban Farmers' Bank for handling. The bank specifically ordered Hu Duming, the director of the transportation and sales office, to contact Gu Xinyi, the chairman of the Shanghai Grain Association. After several consultations, a contract has been signed. The grain ordered this time is 40% rice and 60% flour (No. 3 flour). The purchasing manufacturers include Huafeng, Shenda, and Leading Cengfeng, etc., more than ten in total. Each factory will extract one-thousandth of the flour they produce specifically for the workers of the Huai River Guidance Project. The term is six months and the price is temporarily set at one yuan and seven jiao to seven jiao and five fen.</p>
<p>Dalian is responsible for transporting all the flour by Dada Shipping Company. The factories deliver goods every other day, and the company transports about 2,000 packages a day to Qingjiangpu. Then, Zhou Hanxiang, the bank's special commissioner, is responsible for distributing them to Dongkan and Lianshui, two grain distribution stations, and then directly to the project site.</p>
<p>Purchasing Rice: A reporter from the Huadong News Agency learned from relevant sources that the project site believes that the workers are mostly from the north, so flour cannot suit everyone. Therefore, they have ordered another 40% of rice from the grain industry. The price of rice has been high recently, so a special commissioner has been sent to the interior to purchase it, and they will select purchases separately in Nanjing, Nantong, Suzhou, Wuxi, Qingjiangpu, and other places.</p>

When the ship departed from Glasgow, Scotland, Ma Jiajun, Teng Shibiao, Zhang Guoquan, etc., who were sent by the Bureau to learn to drive and operate the ship's engine, returned to Shanghai with it. The representative of the shipyard, Marconi &amp; Co., notified the China Merchants Bureau yesterday that the Hai Xiang passed Hong Kong on the 20th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 24th (tomorrow). However, there has been fog on the sea these days, and the arrival time may be delayed. After the Hai Xiang arrives in Shanghai, it must enter the Jiangnan Factory for inspection before being officially accepted.</p>
<p>Successful Negotiation: Zhou Houkun, deputy director of the shipping department, was sent to Hong Kong by the Bureau when the first Hai ship, Hai Yuan, set sail, to request a new passenger license for the ship from the Hong Kong Shipping Administration Office and to negotiate for the captain of the Hai ship to be Chinese. It has been confirmed that the Hong Kong Shipping Administration Office, as a result of Mr. Zhou's negotiations, has issued the new passenger license and approved the Chinese to drive the Hai ship without examination, etc. Mr. Zhou has telegraphed his departure from Hong Kong to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Crew Appointed: The Bureau held a board meeting yesterday. Liu Hongsheng proposed that Ma Jiajun be appointed as the new captain of the Hai Xiang (the original owner of the Xin Ming ship, who went to England this time to learn to drive the new ship). The first mate is Sun Fuge, the second mate is Xu Dequ, and the third mate is Huang Jicheng. The engine chief is transferred from the Hai Xiang ship, Nelson. The first engineer is Li Yunmao, the second engineer is Wang Qingting, and the third engineer is Lu Guoshun. These appointments have been sent to the shipping department yesterday, and the crew will be notified tomorrow when the new ship arrives in Shanghai and after the ship's hull is inspected, they will go aboard to serve.</p>
<p>Special Features of the Machinery: The advantages of the machinery in the four new ships are not available in the other Hai ships, and are unique to these four ships. One is the freshwater manufacturing machine. In the past, commercial ships had to carry enough drinking water. If the freshwater supply was interrupted, they had to stop sailing to find it and then set sail again. Now, all four ships have freshwater manufacturing machines. Even if the water supply is cut off, seawater can be filtered and extracted for drinking at any time. Another is the water tank alarm. If the water tank overheats, the machine will explode immediately. Now the new ships have an alarm to report the water tank temperature and use fuses. Even if one part explodes, there is still a machine that can keep the ship sailing and avoid unexpected dangers. These are truly special features.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Wang Qingmu's Letter to Chairman Chen of Jiangsu on the Issue of Joint Governance of Chongming and Qidong <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Qingmu's letter to Chairman Chen of Jiangsu stated: "I came to the province yesterday to pay my respects, but you had already gone to Huaiyin to lead the commencement of the Huai River estuary project, bustling about and enduring hardships, which is admirable. I met with Secretary-General Luo, who indicated that the Civil Affairs Bureau had submitted a document opposing the joint governance of Chongming and Qidong. I suspect that the Civil Affairs Bureau does not fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of separation, or has listened to prior opinions and holds preconceived notions. One of these two must be the case. Otherwise, the people of Chongming and Qidong would not have sent legal representatives to petition for relief, claiming that they are suffering from the division. It is by no means a groundless complaint, so how can it be ignored? The public petition from Huang Housheng and others in Chongming stated that those who advocate separation aim to plunder property. This is the truth and cannot be concealed. Under the current accounting system, funds from category A cannot be used for category B, and funds from category C cannot be used for category D. The boundaries are clear. The Chongming seawall public land is a special fund for annual repairs, and the charity fund is a special fund for helping the orphaned and impoverished. Even if Qidong can be divided into a county, harming this to benefit that is not reasonable. Moreover, Qidong's acquisition of the seawall public land has not been used for seawall construction, and its acquisition of the charity fund has not been used for helping the orphaned and impoverished. It only causes significant losses to Chongming, while Qidong gains nothing. If the separation is not revoked, those who plunder Chongming's property will enjoy unwarranted rights and receive unexpected guarantees. How can this reversal of right and wrong be justified? Although the people of Chongming are weak, how can they not voice their grievances? Moreover, there are more unreasonable aspects of the separation than this. The outer sand of Chongming is cut off to form a county, but the tax quota originally borne by the outer sand is spread over the inner sand. The middle class is raised to the upper class, and the lower class is raised to the middle class, causing farmers to suddenly increase their suffering. This is the first unreasonable aspect. The county division violates public opinion, and Chongming's administrative expenses are insufficient, so it should request subsidies from the provincial treasury. However, it is forcibly imposing a surtax on land tax under the name of administrative subsidies. This is the second unreasonable aspect. Most of the land in Qidong belongs to the people of Chongming. All the people of Chongming have fulfilled their tax obligations, but they cannot participate in all local affairs due to the separation of counties, which is not as good as the taxpayers in the foreign concessions of Shanghai, who still have the right to make suggestions. This is especially fundamentally unsuitable for separation. I have been entrusted by the elders of my hometown to travel and appeal for many years, but the matter has not been resolved. I am restless at night, ashamed beyond measure. I deeply hope that you will examine the people's plight, not be swayed by superficial words, and inform us of the reasons why the Civil Affairs Bureau's submission is irreversible, so that we can consider and restore our reputation. You love the people of Jiangsu and treat them equally, and you should not neglect Chongming and Qidong because they are remote. Wang Qingmu, October 31st."</p>
<h3 id="e131">Municipal Council Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Resignation of Councilors</p>
<p>Initiating a Memorial Service for Speaker Shi</p>
<p>Since Speaker Shi's position has been vacant, the Municipal Council held an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss everything. Wang Honglai was temporarily elected as chairman, and all councilors expressed their condolences to Speaker Shi. They continued to discuss the issue of resignation, stating that they have received a letter from the municipal government regarding the resignation of councilors, stating that the Municipal Self-Government Law is still under review by the Legislative Yuan and has not been promulgated and implemented, so there is no basis for holding elections. A formal Municipal Council cannot be established for the time being, and it is hoped that they will reluctantly continue to serve in order to uphold the spirit of the rule of law and achieve practical results. All the councilors present said that when they were established, the term was originally one year, and they have now been re-elected for one year. They are ashamed that they have not contributed to the progress of municipal administration and should reaffirm their previous request in order to fulfill their original intention. They unanimously agreed. They then discussed jointly initiating a memorial service for Speaker Shi with the United Local Association and the Newspaper Association, and collecting the consent of various public organizations. It was passed and it was decided to hold a public memorial service when Speaker Shi's coffin arrives.</p>

<p>Wang Chengying, Director of the Finance Department of Zhejiang Province, has been negotiating for a loan of 20 million yuan secured by local public debt tickets of the province in the 23rd year of the Republic. Since March 10th, he has invited the leaders of various banks for discussions several times, and an agreement has been reached.

The monthly interest rate is 8%, and the loan will be repaid in two years. All conditions will be handled in accordance with the Jiangsu Public Debt method. The borrowing banks are China, Communications, Shanghai, Zhongnan, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Real Estate, China Real Estate, Siming, Jincheng, Jianye, Continental, and Commercial banks, etc., twelve banks in total. The amount of the loan undertaken by each bank has also been allocated. As for the loan contract, the manager of the Zhejiang Local Bank returned to Hangzhou from Shanghai on the 18th to draft it, referring to the old loan contract of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. Director Wang originally planned to stay in Shanghai to wait for the signing, but because the affairs of the Finance Department are cumbersome and need to be dealt with urgently, he took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train back to Hangzhou at 6:50 pm on the 21st to report the negotiation process to the provincial government meeting and discuss the issuance procedures. As soon as the contract is drafted, he will bring the contract to Shanghai and invite all the borrowing banks to formally sign it.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Alcohol Consolidated Tax to be Levied Today <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Tax Administration Announces Regulations</p>
<p>The Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance announced today the [Provisional Regulations for Alcohol Consolidated Tax], which will be levied from today. The [Collection Regulations] are also announced at the same time. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Types of Alcohol: All alcohol manufactured domestically or imported from abroad will be subject to consolidated tax. When imported goods enter the country, import duties will still be paid first, but after the consolidated tax has been levied, no further taxes will be levied when the goods are sold in various provinces.</p>
<p>Two Tax Rates: Alcohol is divided into two categories, A and B, for taxation. A: Ordinary alcohol, the tax rate is 1 jiao and 3 fen per liter in national currency. B: Denatured alcohol and wood alcohol (including light coconut wine and fusel oil), 6 fen and 5 li per liter. Regardless of whether it is in barrels or packages, the tax should be calculated based on the net volume of each barrel or package. Any fraction of a liter less than one liter will be counted as one liter. For boxed items, the volume of each item in the box should be calculated. Any remainder less than one liter will also be counted as one liter. For bottled items that are not in boxes, each bottle should be counted. The method is the same as above.</p>
<p>Collection Method: For domestically produced alcohol, tax officials will be stationed at the factory to collect the tax. For alcohol imported from abroad, the customs will collect the tax at the same time when the goods are unloaded from the warehouse and import duties are paid. A passport should be obtained for transportation to other ports.</p>
<p>Tax Refund Method: If alcohol that has already paid consolidated tax is sold in various provinces and is re-taxed, evidence should be submitted within three months to request a tax refund from the original consolidated tax agency. If domestically produced alcohol is sold overseas, or imported alcohol is re-exported domestically, a tax refund can also be obtained according to legal procedures. Inspection and Registration: Manufacturers of alcohol should report the start time of work, and resident staff will supervise. When starting transportation, transferring, and arriving, reports should also be submitted for inspection. New alcohol factories must report to the local tax authorities three weeks before starting production and submit it to the Tax Administration for registration. They must also register with the Trademark Bureau first, and only after registration and approval can they select a brand name.</p>
<p>Punishment Method: If a manufacturer or dealer commits one of the following acts, in addition to confiscating the tax-evaded alcohol, a fine of up to ten times the amount of tax evaded will be imposed, and those who violate criminal law will be transferred to the judicial authorities for investigation. 1. Transporting and selling alcohol without affixing stamps or obtaining transport permits in accordance with regulations. 2. Privately manufacturing alcohol and secretly transporting it out of the factory for sale. 3. Counterfeiting the trademarks of other companies, privately manufacturing alcohol, and selling it on the market to evade taxes. 4. Counterfeiting stamps, documents, seals, or using counterfeit stamps and documents to evade taxes. 5. Reusing old stamps, or reusing old boxes and barrels without checking the stamps, and reloading them for sale. 6. Discrepancies between goods and documents, or having goods without documents, which is found to be tax evasion. 7. The number of alcohol in the factory stock does not match the records, and it is proven to be evasion. 8. The amount of stamps affixed is insufficient. 9. Reporting ordinary alcohol as denatured alcohol to reduce the tax rate. In addition, alcohol manufacturers or dealers who commit one of the following acts will be fined up to 200 yuan, depending on the circumstances: (1) Tearing off old stamps that have been affixed in preparation for reuse, and there is evidence to prove it. 2. Privately transporting alcohol containers with old stamps that have not been washed into the alcohol factory without the supervision of the resident staff, and privately manufacturing alcohol. The privately manufactured alcohol will be confiscated.</p>

<p>Discusses Completion of Huangshan Construction</p>
<p>Scheduled to Visit Jiang in Nanjing to Report</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Relief Commission, previously traveled to Nanjing with Huang Bodu in secret to attend the Finance Conference of the Huai River Conservancy Commission. Afterwards, he took a car from Nanjing, passing through Wuhu, to Huangshan to inspect the construction projects. Due to the numerous important matters in Shanghai awaiting his attention, and with the imminent opening of the Drought Relief Association meeting, he left Huangshan the day before yesterday and returned to Shanghai. He arrived at the Shanghai Railway Station by express train from Hangzhou at 7:20 PM the day before yesterday, and immediately proceeded to Father Lao's private residence to rest. According to Mr. Xu's statement to a reporter from the China Eastern News Agency yesterday:</p>
<p>"This time, I wanted to personally inspect the disaster situation in rural areas of various counties, and to conveniently inspect the preliminary planning of the three-month construction project on Huangshan. I took the route through Nanjing, Wuhu, Tunxi, and other places. Along the way, I witnessed the extremely severe disaster situation everywhere. The hardship and suffering of the farmers are almost indescribable. In the places I passed, there were only withered rice stalks, barely a foot tall, remaining in the fields. There was almost no straw stacked in the villages and fields. The meager harvest is imaginable. All the counties I passed through in Anhui Province—Wuhu, Xuancheng, Ningguo, Jixi, Shexian, Xiuning—and in Zhejiang Province—Changhua, Yuchangqian, Lin'an, Hangzhou, Haining, Jiashan, Jiaxing—are affected by the disaster. No place is spared, and the disaster is severe everywhere. The farmers have no savings and are completely impoverished. Winter is fast approaching, and I don't know how they will survive. I sincerely hope that people in the country will do their best to provide relief so that they can overcome the difficulties of this year and plan for stability next spring, which would be a blessing for the nation."</p>
<p>"The preliminary construction project on Huangshan has been completed according to the original plan. The total cost of various items is only 16,500 yuan in national currency, which was raised through donations handled by Shiying. The buildings include the Guxiangfu Temple, Jushilin, Bianxi Pavilion, Banshan Temple, Chengxiangyuan, and Yungu Hall. They are generally in line with the principles of simplicity, elegance, firmness, and beauty that I set. The rearrangement of the Front Sea and Back Sea, and the construction of roads and bridges, are also commendable. In addition, the Tangquan and Chishanglou, repaired with funds allocated by the Anhui Provincial Government; the Lansheng Pavilion, donated by Director Liu Shi'an; and the Bailong Bridge, donated by Mr. Li Fanyi, add beauty to the mountain scenery. The two roads opened by Mr. Wu Zhihui through donations to ascend to the peak of Tiandu Peak and to the West Sea Gate are particularly admirable. In such a short period, with such a small amount of money, it was possible to achieve the above results. This is due to the guidance of the provincial authorities, the advocacy of the donors, the support of all parties, and the efforts of the staff stationed on the mountain. I am extremely pleased." Mr. Xu then listed the names of the donors. Those who have already paid include: the Central Relief Commission, with 1,000 yuan for work relief; the Xinwei Relief Association, with 1,000 yuan for work relief; Duan Zhilao, 500 yuan; Mr. Zhang Xiaolin, 1,500 yuan; Mr. Du Yuesheng, 1,500 yuan; Mr. Xu Jingren, 1,500 yuan; Mr. Wang Xiaolai, 1,000 yuan; Chairman Liu Xueya, 1,000 yuan; Mr. Wu Dieqing, 1,000 yuan; Mr. Zhu Douwen and Mr. Zhu Rushan jointly donated 1,000 yuan; Mr. Wang Yiting, 700 yuan; Mr. Wang Zhongqi, 700 yuan; Mr. Bai Liewu, 500 yuan; Mr. Yang Xiaotian, 500 yuan; Mr. Shi Liangcai, 500 yuan; Mr. Liu Xueyuan, 500 yuan; Mr. Chen Chucun, 100 yuan; Mr. Lin Jinwen, 50 yuan; Mr. Hong Yulin and Mr. Huang Bodu jointly donated 150 yuan; Shiying, 200 yuan; Xu Huisui, 200 yuan; Xu Shen Yiren, 100 yuan. There are still those who have pledged but not yet paid, and efforts are being made to collect them. In the future, a list will be published in the newspaper to express gratitude, and a monument will be erected on the mountain to engrave their names. The revenue and expenditure items will be sent to an accountant for audit and public announcement. The head of the technical team stationed on the mountain is Jin Weinong, and the head of the general affairs team is Hou Huizheng, who have worked tirelessly and diligently, and I express my extreme gratitude."</p>
<p>Mr. Xu then briefly described the specific plans for the future construction of Huangshan, saying, "I have some preliminary ideas and have formulated specific plans. The draft implementation plan for the first year is to lease out public land in the Taoyuan area within January and February. The construction work should primarily focus on developing transportation within the mountain. In addition to renovating the main roads in the Front Sea and Back Sea, the roads in the North Sea area should also be greatly repaired to facilitate tourists traveling from Taiping and other counties, so as to achieve balanced development. Public buildings in the various school Yuan Village residential areas and the Ziyunji commercial area, as well as public security, production and construction, geological flora and fauna surveys, and geodetic surveying, also urgently need to be addressed. The protection and restoration of scenic spots and historical sites throughout the mountain, and the promotion and improvement of local specialties, are particularly important, as Huangshan has many specialties, some of which are extremely valuable. The area below the West Sea Gate has been untouched by humans for thousands of years, and I plan to organize an expedition immediately. However, I am only one of the standing members of the Huangshan Construction Committee, and I need to discuss this in detail with Chairman Liu and other standing members before submitting it to the general meeting for deliberation and decision. I sincerely hope that enlightened people across the country will provide more guidance. Not only will this committee be happy to accept it, but it is also what Shiying personally hopes for." Mr. Xu also said that transportation outside Huangshan Mountain is now more convenient than before. The Hangzhou-Hui, Wuhu-Tunxi, and Yin-Tunxi roads have long been open to traffic. Tourists can travel from Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhu, Datong, Jiujiang, and other places and arrive in the morning and evening. The order in the surrounding areas is very good. I arrived on the mountain at 4:00 AM on the 11th and had no escorts. The road was very peaceful. The reporter then asked if the chairman, who is sixty-two years old, felt tired climbing the mountain at night. Mr. Xu replied with a smile, "It's not just climbing the mountain at night, but also hiking in the mountains on dark nights for 30 to 50 li (approximately 15 to 25 kilometers) every day. This is because the scenery of Huangshan is magnificent, majestic, secluded, and beautiful, and it is enough to please the heart and mind. I remember climbing Bihai to Believe Peak on the 16th and seeing Jiuhua Mountain and Lushan Mountain as clearly as if they were painted. The white clouds on the river were like strips of silk. Then I went to the West Sea Gate and looked at the peaks of the West Sea. I marveled at the wonders of nature, the work of ghosts and gods, which is unbelievable. Therefore, each visit is a new discovery. I enjoy this and don't get tired of it. People say that the scenery of Huangshan is unique in the world, and the joy of traveling in Huangshan is unparalleled. Those who have visited will not think this is an exaggeration. There is a couplet in Lion Forest that says, 'So wonderful that it cannot be described, how could this be? Those who arrive will know.' You cannot understand the recording without experiencing it yourself." According to Mr. Xu's aides, Chairman Jiang is very concerned about relief work and the construction of Huangshan when he is in Nanjing. President Wang is also concerned about Huangshan. Xu plans to visit Nanjing in a few days after resting to seek instructions.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's Daily News in Japanese, Japan anticipates changes in the central government's policies towards Japan, Manchuria, bandit suppression, and national pacification after Chairman Jiang's inspection of North China. Therefore, Japan is paying more attention to its policy and attitude towards China. As a result, a meeting of Japanese army military attaches stationed in China was convened on the 17th and 18th. This meeting has significant implications for the subtle Sino-Japanese relations and has attracted considerable attention both domestically and internationally. After the meeting, a subcommittee of the Japanese in Shanghai, consisting of nine Japanese army military attaches stationed in China and one military attache from the Kwantung Army, aimed to establish a unified understanding of the Chinese attitude among Japanese military attaches stationed in China. In other words, the aim was to have a clearer understanding and understanding of North China and the Yangtze River area than before. After Lieutenant General Suzuki's inspection of Guangdong and Guangxi, the actual situation in the Southwest was fully understood. Based on his report, the main purpose of this meeting was to establish a Japanese attitude to the situation in China. Also, since Sino-Japanese relations in North China have not yet reached complete settlement, military attaches from the Kwantung Army were invited to attend. All the military attaches are now upholding the true spirit of the military and maintaining a unified and thoughtful attitude. Therefore, the meeting was completed in only two days. They adopted a coordinated and unified approach, but the content of the meeting has not yet been released. What can be announced is as follows: 1. The Nanjing government has recently suddenly eased its attitude towards the military, and even some proponents of hard-line arguments are gradually understanding that the military's position is not to act alone. If the Nanjing government does not change its previous attitude, the military's policy will not change. 2. The Sino-Japanese armistice agreement has not yet been implemented. If it is broken, the losses will be on China...</p>
<h3 id="e140">Silk and Satin Guild Resolves Measures to Eliminate Industry Disputes <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>All Retailers Unanimously Stamp and Abide</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Silk and Satin Trade Association of this city believes that the national silk industry is declining day by day, and disputes among fellow merchants are intensifying. The association, mindful of the difficult times and taking the environment into consideration, believes that if these issues are not resolved quickly, the endangered national silk industry will fall into a state of irreversible ruin. Therefore, in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the association's charter, and at the request of the members, in order to seek a fair solution, it has united the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association and the representatives of other companies and businesses to form a special supplementary committee to eliminate disputes and revive the national silk industry. After several meetings and consultations, an outline of the measures was first determined and submitted to the Third Second Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the association for revision and approval. The three articles of the preliminary measures were notified to all retail merchants for unified compliance, and they were ordered to affix their seals to each household to acknowledge and abide by them permanently. The association has already distributed the notification to each retail merchant for their seals. It is now known that Lao Jiefu, Lao Jiuhe, Lao Jiulun, Lixingxiang, Dalun, Dachang, Dacheng, Daxin, Tianfu, Xincheng, Hongxiangtai, Zhuang Tongshun, Yu Deji, Liyang, Tianxiang, Hongzhang, Hongda, Lao Jingfu, Cheng Jinzhang, Dajing, Zhengtai, Lao Jiafu, Zhenda, Tianjin, Yushun, Tongshun, Yu…, Deda, Dashengfu, Tianwan, Sanyi, Dahua, Dakang Xieji, Yuxin, Tianlun, Tianfeng, Lao Jielun, He Changlan, Hengfeng, Za Da, Dazheng, Minghua, Meilun, and other silk and satin shops, as well as Huahua and Shanghai silk and satin companies, and Yongan, Sincere, New Asia, China National Products, Shanghai National Products, Lihua, and other silk departments have all signed and stamped their approval of the three articles of the preliminary outline. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Mr. Luo Qinghua, chairman of the association, who spoke about the recent situation of the silk and satin industry and the future rescue measures, and showed a copy of the association's announcement signed and stamped by fifty-one silk and satin shops and companies, which is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Luo's speech: Mr. Luo Qinghua, a supervisory committee member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, has been in the silk and satin business for many years. This autumn, he was elected as the chairman of the Silk and Satin Trade Association and is well aware of the situation in the industry. The reporter made a special visit to the Silk Industry Bank, where Mr. Luo told him that everyone knows that silk and satin are special products of China with a long and glorious history. Since neighboring countries have begun to imitate them and replace hand-made goods with machine-made goods, the production is fast and the quality is excellent. As a result, the overseas market of national silk has been gradually taken over, and foreign silk imports have almost become the main product. Fortunately, Chinese silk merchants have begun to catch up, buying machines and striving for improvement. Since the emergence of Chinese silk gauze, imported wild silk gauze has no market. In recent years, factories have been able to study carefully, and the technology has become more sophisticated. The products have shown obvious progress. Chinese silk factories can make almost all kinds of silk and satin that can be made in Eastern and Western countries. China has been advocating machine-made goods for nearly 30 years, and the silk and satin industry has made great progress. Chinese people are also becoming more aware of the need to use domestic goods. With these factors, the silk and satin industry should become more prosperous. However, due to the impact of the recent economic downturn, both domestic and foreign sales have become narrow. The machine-made goods is faster than the hand-made goods. Silk and satin merchants, due to the market downturn and difficulty in selling, are rushing to lower prices and compete to sell. Now, merchants in the same industry are undercutting each other more and more fiercely. Some are even disregarding their cost and using radio broadcasts and newspapers to promote cheap goods. If this continues, manufacturers will inevitably cut corners to suit market prices. In general, consumers only care about the low price and don't ask about the quality when they buy. After wearing the clothes, they complain that the quality of domestic goods is not good and use this as an excuse to buy foreign goods. The impact of this is actually significant. The purpose of the three articles of the outline agreed upon by the Silk and Satin Trade Association this time is to correct these malpractices. On the one hand, it wants to enable silk and satin merchants to strive for meager profits in a proper way. On the other hand, it also wants to enable consumers to buy genuine domestic silk and not be overwhelmed by excessive advertising. Now, this outline has been signed and stamped by retail silk and satin shops and companies, and has legally become a contractual act. It is expected that everyone will be able to abide by it and not deviate from it. Mr. Luo also said that he is now working with the Lake Society to prepare for a national silk exhibition. The aim is to promote the advantages of national silk and promote the psychology of using it. It is expected that it can be held at the Lake Society during the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Public Announcement by the Association: Respected Sirs, the national silk business has been declining year by year, and efforts to save it have been ineffective. Disputes among fellow merchants have also intensified. The association, mindful of the difficult times and taking the environment into consideration, believes that if these issues are not resolved quickly, the endangered national silk business will fall into a state of irreversible ruin. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4, Item 2 of the association's charter, and at the request of the members, in order to seek a fair solution, it has united the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association and the representatives of other companies and businesses to form a special committee to eliminate disputes and revive the silk industry. After several meetings and consultations, the three articles of the preliminary measures were determined and submitted to the association for deliberation and implementation. The three articles of the preliminary measures have now been revised and approved by the First Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Third Association and notified to all retail merchants for unified compliance, and they have been ordered to affix their seals to each household to acknowledge and abide by them permanently. The preliminary measures are recorded as follows: 1. Merchants are in business to make a profit of ten percent. The selling price of silk and satin is usually at least ten percent higher. 2. The right to set prices is controlled by the manufacturers. 3. No slander or depreciation of other people's goods is allowed. That is, prices cannot be advertised on radio broadcasts. The association believes that the above three measures are indeed essential for our industry to turn decline into prosperity, and retail merchants should not neglect to understand this and abide by it together. As for the friendship between merchants, we have always valued harmony, but as a result of excessive competition in business, there have been facts such as the closure of factories and the suspension of Laojiuhe silk goods. The association deeply regrets this. From now on, the retail group's business policies will have rules to follow. Colleagues should know that the national situation is in danger, the silk industry is declining, and we must work together to seek common survival and prosperity. The misunderstanding with Laojiuhe in the past should be resolved as soon as possible to restore the harmony between the client and restore the prosperity of the silk industry. This association has high expectations for this and hereby announces it.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Reasons for Using English Yards and Pounds in Foreign Trade <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Requests Submitted by Silk and Electrical Machinery Associations</p>
<p>Instructions from the Ministry of Industry Have Been Approved</p>
<p>The two trade associations of silk and satin merchants and electrical machinery silk weaving factories in this city believe that since their members have followed the new market foot and market scale, in terms of foreign trade, only by using the English yard and pound can foreign merchants be convinced. Therefore, they wrote to the International Trade Bureau to forward to the Ministry of Industry the reasons for the need to prepare English yards and pounds, requesting approval. Now, they have received a reply from the International Trade Bureau stating that, "The reasons you submitted earlier for using the English yard and pound in foreign trade have been investigated and are indeed valid. We have immediately signed an opinion, stating that if any merchant belonging to the two trade associations is fined for having yards and pounds in their accounts, the two trade associations can convert the length of the yard and the weight of the pound into market feet and market catties. However, the conversion must be based on the standards stipulated in the 'Chinese and Foreign Weights and Measures Conversion Table' compiled by the Ministry. The two trade associations should also create a conversion table between yards and pounds and meters and kilograms, and notify their members to follow it. After any store or factory in the two industries trades with foreign merchants, the number of yards and pounds of the goods sold should be converted into market feet and market catties and recorded in the accounts. In this way, all difficulties and disputes can be resolved invisibly." We have submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry for approval. Now, we have received Directive No. 10678 from the Ministry of Industry, stating that, "We have received your request and have temporarily approved the proposed method. However, the members of each association should first submit the method and the number of English yard and pound instruments they have prepared to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for verification and record. Please instruct them to comply with this order." Based on this, we have specially forwarded the details of the handling to your association and hope that you will investigate and notify your members to comply. In accordance with the letter, the two trade associations immediately reprinted the "Chinese and Foreign Weights and Measures Conversion Table" compiled by the Ministry and created a conversion table between yards and pounds and meters and kilograms, which were recorded and distributed to each of their members, along with the letter and directive, for unified compliance. The number of English yard and pound instruments to be prepared by each member was also submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for record.</p>

<p>Ms. Chen Meimei is Charitable and Generous</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Hubei Province is extremely severe. People from Hubei living in Shanghai have formed a Disaster Relief Committee and are soliciting donations from various sources. Mr. Wang Shao Cheng, a member of the committee, hosted a banquet at the Atlantic Hotel yesterday. Those who attended included Xing Mianzhai, Zheng Zijia, Zhang Ruitang, Yan Chuntang, Za Hongyi, Zheng Ziming, Hu Hailou, Xu Changchuan, Yang Shao Chen, Chen Zhen Chen, Guo Qiqing, Hua Qingquan, and Long Zizhen. Mr. Zheng stated that the disaster situation in Hubei Province is extremely severe, and people are dying on the roads. Now that it is winter, those who have not died are also without food or clothing, crying from hunger and cold. If there is another snowfall, the situation will be even more unbearable. He hoped that everyone would provide assistance so as to benefit the disaster victims and accumulate immeasurable merit. Everyone present donated over 2,000 yuan. Ms. Chen Meimei happened to hear about the disaster situation and felt great compassion. She was so moved by their enthusiasm that she temporarily joined the gathering and offered 50 yuan from her own winter clothing expenses to help with the Hubei disaster relief. This shows her compassion and generosity, and she has the spirit of a hero. Compared to Zeng Fan offering his robe and Chunren helping with wheat, she is even more commendable. Ms. Chen Meimei is worthy of praise!</p>

I respectfully send five yuan, which was given to me by a friend for my expenses, to express my condolences and ask that it be checked and forwarded to the Shanghai Committee for the Assistance of Patriotic Martyrs. Yours sincerely, Gao Qingfeng, and also ask the gentlemen of Shen Bao to witness."</p>

<p>Due to Unfulfilled Marriage Wishes</p>
<p>Wang Kongdi from Jiangyin, 21 years old, lives at 125 Avenue du Roi Albert, French Concession, and runs a Jiuyu cigarette shop. Recently, he became acquainted with Yang Guilan (21 years old), a local woman. Their relationship was unusual, and they wanted to make a lifelong promise. However, Yang's parents were stubborn and refused to listen, even after several matchmakers tried to persuade them. Wang and Yang were deeply in love, but were struck by this blow. On the night before last, they went to Room 170 of the Asia Hotel on Sanma Road and took raw opium together to commit suicide at midnight. The waiter discovered this and reported it to the police station, who ordered detectives to rush to the scene and send them to Renji Hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Four Threatening Letters Demanding Extortion of Three Thousand Yuan <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Detectives Disguised for Contact</p>
<p>One Bandit Arrested</p>
<p>Rong Jiadao, the Ningbo native owner of Xieheshun Paper and Incense Shop at 225 Seward Road, suddenly received four threatening letters from bandits between the 4th and 19th of last month. The first letter contained a bullet, demanding 1,500 yuan. The subsequent three letters increased the demand to 3,000 yuan, initially arranging contact at the Great World, Small World, and the Jingju (Peking Opera) and Changzhou Tanhuang (local opera) sections of the amusement park. Otherwise, they threatened to resort to violent means, posing a danger to his life. After receiving the letters, Rong was extremely frightened and reported the matter to the Hongkou Police Station. Detectives Wang Runhe, Bai Mingfu, and others were dispatched to the arranged locations for an arrest, but to no avail. The last letter arranged a meeting at Room 8 of the Shuixing Hotel in the French Concession's Eight Immortals Bridge area to deliver the money. Someone was to come and collect it. The victim sent his representative, Xue Changgui, with a leather suitcase containing mock banknotes from the "Ming Dynasty Bank," with one genuine ten-yuan banknote from the Zhongnan Bank wrapped in the middle to resemble 3,000 yuan. Xue was accompanied by detectives Wang and Bai, disguised as travelers. Yesterday afternoon, they first went to a room opposite Room 8 of the hotel to wait. At around 11 o'clock, they saw a man in a black cotton-padded jacket and trousers arrive and enter Room 8. Xue Changgui, carrying the suitcase with the agreed-upon signal, and detectives Wang and Bai rushed forward, arresting him. Upon interrogation, he was identified as Xie Caixi, a native of Shaoxing, and taken back to the police station for detention. This morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Mr. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, detailed the prior events, requesting an adjournment. The letters were presented for examination. Subsequently, victim Rong Jiadao and witness Xue Changgui testified to the course of events. Defendant Xie Caixi confessed that he was acting on the instructions of a fugitive named Gen Sheng. Judge Wu Zihan, after deliberation, ordered him to be remanded in custody for further verification.</p>

<p>Sending Liang to Seaside Middle School for Studies</p>
<p>Since the Shangyu sojourners association sent the patriotic person Liang Tongfang out, people from all walks of life have been visiting to offer their concerns and support. The previously quiet West 7th Pu Road has suddenly become a bustling scene, with cars and horses crowding the area. Therefore, Liang was sent to Pingmin Hospital to avoid the commotion, where Director Yang Zhongfu personally provided treatment. It is reported that he is now able to sleep soundly at night, his panic attacks have completely subsided, and his wounds are gradually healing. The association, for the sake of his aftermath issue, organized a special committee during the visits. Last night at 7 o'clock, the first meeting was held, attended by over twenty people, including Zhang Dafu, Zhang Jiezhou, Feng Buqing, Sun Jiufeng, He Yuqing, Fang Peicheng, Wang Zhixiang, Zhao Erchang, Du Chunxun, and Liu Xiaotian. Feng Buqing was elected as chairman, and Liu Xiaotian as secretary.

<p>The mother of Dr. Wang Jingqi, former Chinese envoy to Belgium, Chinese plenipotentiary representative to the League of Nations' Opium Advisory Committee, and president of the National Labor University, passed away last month, as previously reported in the newspaper. It is now learned that the date for Madame Wang's memorial service has been set for the 25th of this month (Sunday) at the Pilu Temple in Nanjing. Because Madame Wang's grandson, Dr. Wang Suizheng, is currently employed at the Department of European and American Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Dr. Wang Jingqi's friends and colleagues are mostly in Nanjing, holding the memorial service there is more appropriate than in Shanghai. In recent days, memorial banners and elegiac couplets have been continuously sent, either directly to the funeral arrangements in Nanjing or forwarded from the Shanghai residence to important figures in the government and leaders in the international diplomatic community. It is expected that the occasion will be marked by solemnity and great honor, with a plain carriage and white horses.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Industrial and Commercial Management Association Releases One-Year Work Overview <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association recently released an overview of its annual work, stating: "In response to social needs, this association was established in July of the 19th year (of the Republic) by Minister Kong and Shanghai's industrial and commercial leaders, and it has been five years since. All matters concerning the research and investigation of scientific management, as well as the collection of data and editing of books, have been carefully planned and actively implemented, with the hope of achieving practical results as soon as possible and contributing to our industrial and commercial sectors. However, the association's funding has been quite strained, leading to a regrettable slow progress in the implementation of its initiatives, and making it difficult to fully realize the planned projects. The association's funding sources, besides the annual membership fees paid by members, rely entirely on subsidies from the government for maintenance. Fortunately, in recent years, efforts have been made to economize, and the funding has been somewhat sufficient, allowing all work to gradually progress. The work of the past year is briefly reported as follows: 1. Publishing Projects: Scientific management is rapidly advancing in advanced countries, and the achievements of its implementation steps can serve as a valuable reference for us. Therefore, in addition to translating and compiling famous works from the East and West to introduce to the people, the association also publishes the Industrial and Commercial Management Monthly, which mainly contains expert articles and can be considered the only publication in China dedicated to the study of management science. 2. Cultivating Management Talent: For all operations, talent is of utmost importance, and cultivating management talent is a pressing need for today's industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, in addition to jointly running the Scientific Management Training Class with the Business School of Shanghai University, the association has also opened an Industrial Management Training Class within the association, starting with intermediate-level talents. Preparations are also underway to open an Industrial and Commercial Management Evening School, dividing the classes into day and night sessions to teach various management sciences. Due to time constraints, it has been decided to start the school in the spring of next year. 3. Investigation and Guidance: The implementation of scientific management must first be based on facts. Those who take established rules and use them improperly will achieve no good results. Therefore, the association, on the one hand, investigates the actual management situation of various factories in Shanghai, conducting detailed inspections, analysis, and synthesis, using the results as a basis for individual contributions, so as to avoid the problem of 'cutting the feet to fit the shoes.' On the other hand, a service department is specially established, stipulating two methods: discussion, reporting, and reorganization, for factories to adopt and implement improvements. Significant benefits have been achieved in their implementation and guidance. For example, after the association's guidance to the Watson Electric Appliance Factory, the factory's production volume has increased significantly compared to before. This has attracted the attention of other factories, and some have already requested the association to guide and improve their management. If future financial resources are sufficient and achievements are evident, then the impact will likely spread, and there is great hope for the improvement of China's production industry. 4. Lectures and Discussions: Scientific management involves countless details. At this stage of advocacy, it is necessary to examine past achievements, observe current conditions, and conduct thorough discussions to establish the steps for implementing improved management. The association holds discussion and lecture meetings every month, inviting experts to lecture on various management methods and economic issues related to industry and commerce, and the lecture records are published in the monthly journal for the reference of all sectors. The above is a summary of the association's recent work. Future progress will depend on the needs of the environment and the availability of financial resources. It is also hoped that people from all walks of life and the government will provide strong support so that the association's endeavors can thrive and benefit industry and commerce. Would that not be fortunate for the association alone?"</p>

<p>Successfully Completed a Risky Experiment During a Storm</p>
<p>The British cargo ship *Bankok Maru* arrived in Shanghai yesterday, fully loaded with timber, after traveling from Japan. It is reported that after departing from the United States, the ship encountered a severe storm, making the work of adding coal extremely difficult. Therefore, over 1,700 logs of timber carried on the ship were used as fuel. It took fourteen days of sailing from the Pullen Strait to reach Japan. The use of wood instead of coal on a sea vessel is something people talk about. Fortunately, the ship arrived safely in Shanghai, thanks to the efforts and daring of the crew.</p>

<p>The father of Mr. Cai Zengji, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Finance, Mr. Yuan Yu, passed away suddenly on the 20th of this month. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the funeral procession departed from the Cai residence and moved to the Lianyi Villa in Zhabei.

<p>The Huaxing Sewing Shop at 144 Shandong Road, owned by Shen Xirong from Pudong, specializing in mosquito nets and pillowcases, caught fire at around 3:30 AM yesterday. Everyone in the shop was fast asleep, and the fire suddenly broke out in the cotton and fabric pile in the shop, but no one noticed. Therefore, the fire spread uncontrollably. By the time the people upstairs were awakened, it was already unstoppable. At the same time, neighbors were awakened from their dreams and hurriedly carried their belongings, helping the elderly and leading the young, fleeing in panic. The guests at the Lao Huizhong Hotel were even more panicked. Because it was the middle of the night, the fire caused great disturbance. Fortunately, the Central Fire Brigade was nearby and quickly dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire. It was quickly extinguished, but three women in the building were injured by the fire: Shen Xuerong, 29 years old, and Zhong Guixiang, 15 years old. The shop owner was also knocked unconscious by the smoke and unable to escape, resulting in his death by burning. After the fire, firefighters found his charred body among the rubble, in a gruesome state, and sent it to the coroner for examination. The entire shop was also reduced to ashes.

<p>Qidong is located north of the Yangtze River and east of the Yellow Sea. Last autumn, it was hit by a typhoon and tidal surge, which breached the dikes. Fortunately, charitable organizations and philanthropists in Shanghai generously provided aid, enabling tens of thousands of disaster victims to survive the winter and spring through emergency relief and work relief. Unexpectedly, this year's summer drought has been devastating, with many of the planted corn, cotton, and beans yielding no harvest in as many as 22 villages. The number of disaster victims awaiting relief is estimated to be over 80,000. County Magistrate Li Baojian and local gentry Zhu Chuliang, Zhang Shunru, Shi Wenfan, and Yan Jingzhi have come to Shanghai, together with the resident Shanghai representatives for begging for relief, Gu Nanqun and Gu Yueseng, to seek relief from charitable organizations such as the Chinese Jiji Relief Association, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the World Red Cross, and the provincial drought relief associations.

<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, in response to a request from the Bureau of Public Works and the Central District Construction Committee regarding Shanghai Bank's complaint about Zhabei Water and Electricity Company demanding a temporary water connection fee of 270 yuan for residential buildings under construction on Zhengde East Road and Guojing Road in the central district, has ruled that since the water pipes in that area have already been designated by the municipal government for subsidized water connection, no additional fees are required. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company responded that there was no such incident. Further inquiry from Shanghai Bank revealed that their information was based on a letter from land owner Yu Jinyu, who in turn stated that the information came from architect Hengyao Company. Hengyao Company then claimed that it was conveyed from the Lu Genji Construction Company. Subsequently, Lu Genquan, the owner of the construction company, came to the bureau and stated that he had never told the Hengyao Company that. He is now preparing to file a lawsuit according to law. The true nature of this case is unclear. Since the factory is about to file a lawsuit, the court should investigate and determine the truth. However, because this matter is of great importance, the bureau has published a notice in the newspaper to avoid any future misunderstandings, stating that all water and electricity construction in the central district is fully subsidized by the municipal government, and land owners building houses are not required to pay any fees for water and electricity connections, so that land owners in the district can pay attention and avoid being deceived.</p>

<p>The Shanghai branch of the Wuhua Industrial Bank at No. 130 Ningbo Road in the International Settlement and the Eight Immortals Bridge branch in the French Concession both collapsed several months ago. To date, there has been no effective solution to the claims of depositors and creditors, leading to ten depositors and creditors, including Chu Longgen, Chen Xianji, Luo Lihua, Shi Pengfei, Du Zhiji, Shi Bilong, Shen Peng, Zhou Delin, Wang Fuji, and Pan Yuanji, to hire lawyers Zhang Shijie, Lou Yunmei, Mao Fengwu, and Xu Jie to file a private criminal suit in the Second Special District Court. The defendants are Fan Shaoliang, the deputy manager of the main branch; Ye Haitian; Wang Jian'e, the deputy manager of the branch; Wu Yousan; Xie Shunshan, the assistant manager; Tang Songshan; Tang Shoumin, a consultant; Chen Bingqian, and eight others for fraud. Judge Zhang Qianzuo once held a hearing on September 26th, but all the defendants failed to appear, sending only their lawyers. Since the branch was located in the International Settlement, the issue of jurisdiction was raised. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The Second Special District Court has now issued summonses to both parties and their legal representatives to appear at 2:00 PM this afternoon for a joint hearing in the Second Court by Judge Li Changnian.

<p>Ding Xiuying's Face Covered in Filth</p>
<p>Ding Xiuying, a 20-year-old woman from Yangzhou, was a worker at the Number Three Cotton Mill inside and outside of West Suzhou Road. At around 5:00 PM yesterday, she was returning home from the factory when a man suddenly appeared while she was walking on Yichang Road Bridge, having waited for her there. Upon seeing Ding, he threw a cigarette tin full of manure at her head, covering her face and body in filth and a pungent odor. The woman screamed. A nearby Chinese police officer, No. 2224, heard the scream and rushed over, apprehending the man. He, along with Ding, were brought back to the Putuo Road police station. Under investigation by Detective Chen Guangrong, it was revealed that the man was named Zhang A'er, from Jiangbei. He did not know Ding Xiuying. It turned out that another female worker from the same factory, Miss Jia, had a feud with Ding and had her brother, Lu A'da, pay Zhang four dimes to do it. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Zhang A'er to the Criminal Division Eight of the First Special District Local Court. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, charged Zhang with violating Article 319 of the Criminal Law regarding the obstruction of freedom, and explained the circumstances. Judge Deng Baosun questioned both the plaintiff and the defendant. Since the facts were clear, he immediately rendered a verdict in court, sentencing Zhang A'er to six months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>To Be Re-Questioned After Investigation of Crimes Committed</p>
<p>Detectives from the Laozha Police Station learned that Zhao Yingnian, a woman from Shaoxing residing at No. 206 Xi'an Road, was suspected of forming a gang to rob people. At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, they rushed to the location and arrested Zhao, seizing a handgun. Under questioning at the police station, she confessed that Jin Zhu, a woman from Taizhou hiding at No. 52 Luban Road in the French Concession; Jin Zhaorong, from Zhejiang; and Chen Zi'an, from Xuzhou, were all accomplices. The Chinese and foreign detectives then requested additional detectives from the French Police to assist in arresting Jin Zhu and the other three men and women at the location. Yesterday morning, they were sent along with Zhao Yingnian to the First Special District Local Court. Presiding Judge Feng questioned them. Because the police station still needed to investigate the crimes committed, he ordered them to be detained separately for further questioning.</p>

<p>Zhang Boren, a 21-year-old Western doctor from Ningbo at No. 441 Guangxi Road, married a Miss Zhao in his hometown two years ago. Miss Zhao is one year younger than Zhang. After marriage, the couple had a strong affection for each other. Zhang was assigned to Shanghai for work, so he brought his elderly mother and beloved wife to live with him in the clinic. Soon, a son was born. However, Zhang developed the idea of abandoning his old wife. He ordered Zhao to move out of the clinic and frequently abused her. Zhang's mother also sided with her son against her daughter-in-law. As a result, a harmonious family turned into a place of quarrels. Every time Zhao was abused, she complained to the police station. The police chief always advised them to return home and settle things, as they were a married couple and mother-in-law. On the 14th of this month, Zhang and Zhao had another conflict. Zhang accused her of becoming too liberal after coming to Shanghai and wanted to force her to return to their hometown, while Zhao claimed that Zhang had her move out of the clinic to make it easier for him to have affairs with other women. They argued, then fought. Zhao was punched in the ear, causing injury. Zhao went to the Laozha Police Station with her child, reporting the situation of being beaten. Considering this incident was more serious than before, the police chief deemed it inappropriate to tolerate it any further and filed a lawsuit against Zhang Boren in the Second Special District Local Court for inflicting injury. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng summoned both parties. After questioning, he ordered the defendant to post a 200-yuan bond and rescheduled the trial.</p>

<p>The Wang Yao Kun and Son Too Outrageous</p>
<p>Wang Yaokun, a 49-year-old man from Wuxi, used to run a distiller's shop in his hometown. His son, Wu Xiqing, had been unemployed for a long time, so he asked Chen Yitang, also from Wuxi, to recommend him for a job. Chen, the owner of the Wanyuan Money Shop behind the New World Hotel in Wuxi, introduced him to Dai Shengtan. Dai, in addition to his position at the Wing On Bank in Shanghai, also operated the Yongchang Gold Shop on the third floor of the Silk Industry Bank on Sanma Road, specializing in speculation. Dai promised to help with the job request when the Wing On Bank branch opened. However, Dai requested a purchase of the bank's stocks, valued at 1000 yuan. Wang, eager to get the job, sent 1000 yuan through his father, Yao Kun, in May. Wang Xiqing was temporarily placed in the Yongchang Gold Shop. Recently, Dai's speculation failed, and the Yongchang Gold Shop went bankrupt. Dai disappeared. Wang searched everywhere but could not find him. Not only did the promised job fall through, but also the 1000 yuan invested in stocks was lost. It was an intentional fraud. Because Chen Yitang was the introducer, Wang sought recourse from Chen. Fearing Chen would not come to Shanghai, Wu Xiqing made a long-distance phone call to Chen Yitang in Wuxi yesterday morning, falsely claiming that Dai Shengtan had been apprehended and asked Chen to come to Shanghai immediately. Chen was overjoyed, as he himself had been swindled out of 2000 yuan by Dai. He believed that now that he had been caught, it would be easier to recover the money, so he did not suspect any trickery. Chen rushed to Shanghai in the afternoon. Wang Xiqing met him at the station. Chen and Wang hired a rickshaw and went to 254 Antongqi in Hubei Road. Wang's father, Wang Yao Kun, was in the room as well. After a few minutes, four gangsters broke into the room and, joined by Wang and his father, threatened Chen and forced him to write an IOU for 1000 yuan. Chen, facing violence and helpless, had to write the IOU. After Chen left, he told his friend, Dr. Shen Mengxun, about the ordeal and asked for help. Shen and Chen caught Wang Yao Kun but the others got away. The police found the forced IOU, and imprisoned Wang. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, presented the case to the First Special Court, accusing them of illegal detention under Article 318 of the Criminal Code. Chen Yitang testified that the 1000 yuan was given to Dai Shengtan. Wang Yao Kun claimed that the money was delivered to Chen Yitang on May 16th. He asked Jiang Yiping, lawyer, to present evidence. Judge Deng ordered the case adjourned for seven days for further hearing, and approved Wang Yao Kun's request to post a 500-yuan bond.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Pilot Petitioning Group Petitioned Xu Jixiang Yesterday <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>No Result as Xu Was in Beijing on Official Business</p>
<p>Banquet for Maritime Groups Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai and Hanzhong Joint Petitioning Group for Pilots, consisting of forty retired pilots, took a car to the residence of Xu Jixiang, the Director of the Marine Affairs Department of the Navy, Principal of the Pilot Training School, and Executive Committee Member of the Pilot Management Committee, to seek his assistance. Learning that Xu was in Beijing on official business, his wife met with the group and accepted their petition to pass it on to Xu. The content of the petition can be summarized into three points: 1. The previous examination was very corrupt, so they requested a re-examination. 2. The level of the previous examination was too inconsistent and lacked standards. The scope of the re-examination must be clearly defined. 3. Sufficient preparation must be allowed for the re-examination, requesting three months. During this preparation period, they should still be allowed to operate under licenses issued by the Navy to maintain their livelihood. In order to inform colleagues of the situation and promote mutual assistance, the association hosted a banquet for various maritime groups at the Guyixuan Hunan and Sichuan Restaurant on Sanma Road at 6:00 PM last night. Attendees included representatives from the Nanjun'an, Yan Ying General Society, Shipping Guild, Navigation Association, Helmsman Carpenter Mutual Aid Society, and the Drivers Association, totaling over thirty people. The chairman, Zhang Zichong, reported on the association's history since its establishment and its current position, hoping for unanimous support from the maritime groups. The representatives present all expressed their acceptance. The meeting adjourned at around 9:00 PM. It was also reported that the Shanghai Shipping Guild held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Yu Qiaqing stated that although the pilotage fees had been reduced by the customs, the amount was still difficult to accept. It was resolved that shipowners could only accept an increase in pilotage fees up to 30% of the old rate, and any amount exceeding that would not be accepted. It was also reported that the Pilot Management Committee also convened a committee meeting yesterday, but it was adjourned due to a lack of quorum.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Two Months' Imprisonment, Suspended for Two Years</p>
<p>The Huarong Coal Store, located at No. 179 Rue Poinsett in the French Concession and owned by Huarong Wood, had a relatively thriving business. It sold Chinese coal balls from the China Coal Ball Factory on North Sichuan Road. However, starting on June 1st of this year, it suddenly stopped doing business with the China Factory. Subsequently, Qiu Guozhen, an employee of the China Factory, discovered that Huarong had forged the China Factory's red label and purchased discarded trademark papers, selling inferior coal balls under the guise of Chinese coal balls for profit. The French Police received a report and Detective Lu Changsheng went to the Huarong store, seized the forged red label and arrested Huarong Wood and sent to the Second Special District Court. The Police lawyer filed a charge for obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce. The trial has been reported previously. Yesterday, Judge Wu Fanglian questioned Huarong Wood at the Criminal Eighth Court and announced the verdict in court: Huarong Wood, with the intent to profit and deceive others, instigated the counterfeiting of a registered trademark and was sentenced to two months' imprisonment, suspended for two years. During the appeal period, he must post a 500-yuan bond and await further instructions.</p>

<p>Since accepting the joint request of over 500 households in Punan, Pudong, to establish a Pudong branch, the Shanghai Nanshi District Rent Reduction Association has been actively working on rent reduction. Recently, Laiyidu, Dongchang Road, Dongxingchang, Zhu Hetao, and fifty other businesses requested rent reduction. The association has sent a letter to landlord Zhao Jingqian and dispatched members Zhang Binghua and Ren Baiguang to negotiate with the landlord repeatedly. A 20% reduction has been achieved. It is said that Zhao Jingqian was the first in Pudong to implement rent reduction. The executive committee decided, with the support of the majority of businesses and residents in Pudong, that Zhao has shown a great understanding of justice. In addition to presenting him with a plaque for "Benefiting the Community", he was also elected as a member of the Pudong Rent Reduction Association.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Wing On Bank's Business Is Prosperous <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The task of banks in the economic field is to develop enterprises and regulate finance, so their mission is extremely important and their scope is very wide. There have been many such organizations in Shanghai in recent years, but the Wing On Bank can be considered a rising star. This newspaper has previously reported on its social spirit. Now, the bank has informed us of its latest facilities, which not only benefit the public but also make its business prosperous, showing a rapid growth. Let us describe them separately.</p>
<p>International Trade Department The bank's opening declaration stated that its aim is to increase exports and recover losses. Given the immaturity of domestic industry and commerce and the bankruptcy of rural areas, even reducing the cost of necessary raw material imports is tantamount to recovering a portion of the profit, which is not easy. In recent months, the bank has made every effort to establish an international trade department. Everything related to the export of goods, including customs clearance and shipment, can be handled on behalf of customers at low fees for convenience. The import of goods, such as raw materials necessary for industry and commerce, can also be handled on behalf of customers, reducing costs by 15% compared to dealing directly with foreign firms. Experts have been invited to design and open offices to promote the initiative step by step.</p>
<p>Personnel Trust The domestic society is becoming increasingly complex. Personnel trust, such as estate execution and property management, is still in its infancy. To address private disputes, the bank has hired many legal and accounting experts to form a legal department. All personnel matters can be handled on behalf of customers, solving their legal problems.</p>
<p>Remittance Hong Kong and Guangzhou have early on been connected, so remittance inflows and outflows have been massive. The bank is fast in reporting market prices and charges lower fees. Customers in the Hongkou area are constantly entrusting remittances to the bank. Recently, over one hundred and fifty Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangsu banks have been added to facilitate transactions.</p>
<p>Deposits Deposits are popular because of short terms, high-interest rates, and secure protection. The bank mainly handles loans with objects as collateral, focusing on bill discounts and pledge loans. Credit loans are not accepted. Small factories will be given various facilities.</p>
<p>Special Business The bank is open until 12:00 AM. It has been decided that a security measure will be in place to make the transactions safe during the winter months. For every disbursement of more than one thousand yuan, an armored vehicle will be available for free escort. For deposits, there is no need to come in person. A phone call will be assigned to receive the funds. In this way, there is no security risk for the evening inflow and outflow.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Trial of Embezzlement Case Against Employees of Nanxiang Bus Company <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Two Defendants Flatly Deny Charges</p>
<p>Case Adjourned for Re-examination</p>
<p>This case involves the Shanghai-Nanxiang bus company, where employees Zhang Hesheng and Gu Songqiao allegedly embezzled public funds under the guise of expenses for public relations with the Public Works Bureau and the Public Security Bureau. The Public Works Bureau discovered the matter and sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting a thorough investigation. The Bureau then detained Zhang and Gu and sent them to the District Court. Prosecutor Xiao Pu侦查 found the allegations to be true and filed charges in the criminal court, alleging that the defendants Zhang Hesheng and Gu Songqiao committed embezzlement. The charges stated that Zhang Hesheng was the chief of transportation for the Nanxiang Bus Company and, along with Gu Songqiao, was responsible for handling financial matters. In July of this year, they jointly embezzled over two hundred and ten yuan. Zhang Hesheng instructed the bookkeeper Wu Ciyin to record the amount as expenses paid to the Public Works Bureau and Public Security Bureau for public relations. This was discovered by the Public Works Bureau, which then handed the case over to the Public Security Bureau. The defendants were jointly responsible for managing finances at the Nanxiang Bus Company. The ledger showed payments to the Public Works Bureau and Public Security Bureau for public relations expenses, but Zhang Hesheng denied making these payments. Therefore, the sum was undoubtedly embezzled by Zhang Hesheng and Gu Songqiao. Zhang Hesheng's claim that Wu Ciyin maliciously recorded the expenses to frame him was clearly a fabrication. The defendants were accomplices in violating Article 357, Section 1 of the Criminal Code and should be prosecuted under Article 253, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, requesting a public trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Ji of the Fifth Tribunal specially opened a court session and ordered the defendants Zhang Hesheng and Gu Songqiao, who were in custody, to be brought before the court. Zhang Hesheng testified that he was 42 years old, from Jiading, residing at 51 Xiaoshadu Road, and currently the chief of transportation for the Shanghai Nanxiang Bus Company. Question: "Are you in charge of the finances?" Answer: "No." Question: "What are you in charge of?" Answer: "Repairing machinery and purchasing materials." Question: "Did you give 50 yuan to the Public Works Bureau on June 30th?" Answer: "That's a mistake in the ledger." Question: "What did you use the 180 yuan from July 14th and July 21st for?" Answer: "30 yuan was paid to the City Bank for licensing fees, and the rest was used to purchase parts and materials for the buses, all of which have invoices to prove it." Question: "You didn't give any of this money to the Public Works Bureau or the Public Security Bureau?" Answer: "No." Question: "Then isn't that embezzlement?" Answer: "That's a false accusation!" Question: "Can you write?" Answer: "I haven't studied." Next, Gu Songqiao testified that he was 50 years old, from Jiading. Question: "What are you in charge of?" Answer: "I manage the finances at the Shanghai branch, but I don't handle the Nanxiang branch." Question: "Who gave the money to Zhang Hesheng?" Answer: "The manager." Question: "What is Wu Ciyin's position?" Answer: "Chief Accountant." Question: "Did you pay Zhang Hesheng on June 30th?" Answer: "No, it was paid from the Nanxiang branch." Question: "What did Zhang Hesheng use the money for?" Answer: "To purchase parts." Question: "Why does the ledger say 'public relations expenses'?" Answer: "I don't know." Question: "Did you lobby for licenses with money?" Answer: "No, there was no such thing." Then, Gao Zhongyu testified that he was 38 years old, from Gaoyou, formerly an aide to the National Government's adjutant's office, and currently the chairman of the board of directors of the bus company. Question: "What is Zhang Hesheng's position?" Answer: "Chief of Transportation." Question: "Does he manage the finances?" Answer: "Yes, he does. On September 7th, Zhang came to my office by bus and said that if we wanted to operate, we had to lobby the Public Works Bureau first. That's how I knew he was misusing public funds." Question: "But Zhang Hesheng has consistently denied it." Answer: "It's recorded in the ledger, and he personally told me about it." Question: "Do you have evidence of him giving this money to someone at the Public Works Bureau?" Answer: "No evidence." The judge then ordered manager Ni, 23 years old, from Shanghai, residing in Caojiadu, to appear in court. Question: "Who is in charge of management?" Answer: "They all manage it together." Question: "Is there a rough draft of the ledger?" Answer: "Yes." Question: "Did Zhang Hesheng take this money for public relations expenses?" Answer: "Yes." Question: "Where is the rough draft of the ledger?" Answer: "At the Nanxiang branch." Finally, Wu Ciyin testified that he was 36 years old. Question: "Are you in charge of the ledger?" Answer: "Yes." Question: "Who manages the finances?" Answer: "Zhang and the other two." Question: "Who instructed you to record this payment?" Answer: "Zhang Hesheng told me to write it down." Question: "Was this record copied from the rough draft?" Answer: "No." The judge concluded that the case was complex and required further testimony. The two defendants were remanded in custody to await further hearings at a later date.</p>

This new energy-saving and durable invention is not only unique to China but is also unprecedented in the world. A factory has now been established to manufacture these bulbs, and the general distributor of Burton Multi-Filament Light Bulbs in China is located at 123, South end of Daxin Street, Simalu.

Dr. Zhou is from Yixing and graduated from the National Southeast Medical College. He has a deep understanding of medicine, especially surgery. He has served as a physician at major hospitals in the National Central Hospital and Fujian and Liaoning provinces. Since arriving at the hospital, all difficult cases have been brought back to life once he takes charge. He is also kind and approachable and is especially capable of guiding patients in psychological and nursing methods. Nowadays, doctors like Dr. Zhou are rare.

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 5: The Imperial Decree Smiles with Fawning, the Lamp Illuminates the Wasted Face; the Intestines and Spleen are Pressed to Apply Powder and Learn Fashion</p>
<p>The clothes he wore, although made of silk, were made of the kind of soft satin that was excessively cheap in Jiangnan, selling for only two or three mao per foot. These clothes were still made in Jiangnan. Just looking at the length, they were not the kind that dragged behind the heels. The slits were more than a foot long, passing the knees, and the cuffs were level with the elbows. This was not the style of 1934. This proved that even if he came from Jiangnan, he had left Jiangnan for more than a year. The leather shoes he wore were no longer the latest shallow round-toe style, and a leather strap was fastened across the instep. This made him look especially old. But only Zhang Jiefu and Li Shilian could tell that he was not fashionable. In Hu Saozi's eyes, she thought he was excessively ostentatious. So she gently asked a waiter who had not left, "Is he from the Kaiyuan Temple?" (Note: Kaiyuan Temple is an ancient temple built in the Tang Dynasty and is one of the historical sites of Xi'an. Now, prostitutes live on both sides of the entrance to the temple.) The waiter glanced at the outside, frowned, and said, "I don't recognize him." As he spoke, the three men and one woman all went into Li Shilian's room. Hu Saozi stood up, clapped her hands, raised her hands, and laughed, "No need to mention it today, I'll come again tomorrow morning." As she spoke, she walked out, only to hear Li Shilian calling out, "Quick, invite Mr. Jia! Quick, invite Mr. Jia!" Although Hu Saozi had no relationship with Jia Duocai, she saw someone who looked like he was from the Kaiyuan Temple here, and now they were inviting Mr. Jia. She felt this was a bit unfair and wanted to see what was going on, so she stopped walking away and stood by the courtyard gate, leaning on the door and stretching her head inside. That was how she stood there. In less than ten minutes, hurried footsteps came, and someone laughed beside her, "You've come too?" As the person spoke, he walked past, still with a smile. Hu Saozi saw that it was Jia Duocai. (71)</p>

<p>— Tian Sheweng</p>
<p>This was about three years ago. I was teaching in a mansion, and I had been there for a full eight years. Because those who were poisoned by [literary poison] lacked the knowledge to deal with the world, in these eight years, besides teaching, I only knew how to read, write essays, and write some ugly little pieces, submitting them to this newspaper. I had been doing this for twenty years. I didn't know how to socialize, I only knew how to be elegant. Later, because the two young masters of this mansion—who were my students—had both married and had children and were in their twenties, the head of the household treated me very kindly and gave me a year's vacation, saying, "Next year, the two young masters will go to the bank to do business and will no longer study. Please find another job." At the end of the year, of course, I had to leave with my brush pot. Because I didn't usually socialize and lacked the knowledge to deal with the world, I naturally had problems with finding a job next year.</p>
<p>In this mansion for eight years, because the head of the household liked to practice meditation and sitting, he was a Taoist believer. So I got to read some Taoist books. Over time, I discovered many scientific values in Taoism that even the Japanese may not have mentioned. Various books about Taoism published in bookstores did not mention this at all. I often thought of making a clear and rational explanation of my insights in a [Scientific View of Taoism] to save the ills of Western material civilization. Regarding the philosophy of life and political philosophy, I would use Taoist learning to inject healing needles. But, to this day, not a single word has been written.</p>
<p>With the motive of finding a job, I first turned the doctrines of Lao Zhuang into a five-thousand-word novel entitled [A Dream of Longevity], with Wei Boyang, Zhong Liquan, Lü Chunyang, Ge Xianweng, Zhang Sanfeng, and He Xiangu as characters who explained the true meaning of longevity and the philosophy of life. I also wrote a cover letter and this novel and sent them to Mr. Shi Liangcai, the general manager of this newspaper. Later, he sent a resume form and told me to fill it out and send it back. His original letter said: [Now that the country is so poor and weak, we should work hard for the country and society. Where can we sit quietly and cultivate ourselves, seeking the art of longevity alone!] - That's the general idea! From these few words, you can know Mr. Shi's philosophy of life.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi unfortunately encountered a disaster on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road and died in his prime, forcing me to believe in Lao Tzu's philosophy of life! But, although Lincoln is dead, his spirit lives on. We don't need to be sad for Mr. Shi.</p>

<p>— (Jin Xiongwu)</p>
<p>There are many extremely common names in the world that are difficult to explain. Let's take one example. Why is the area above the lips called the "philtrum"? If we say it is the middle of the human body, it should be between the navel and abdomen. Because from here upwards, the forehead, ears, and nose are all double orifices, and from here downwards, the mouth and the two excretory openings are all single orifices. Three books of yin and three books of yang. Is this taken from the meaning of the Tai hexagram?</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I don't know why, but as soon as I saw the light from these corner lamps, I felt something was different; mostly because they were too dim. Looking elsewhere, in every palace and under every long corridor, the same kind of horn lanterns were hung, emitting a deep yellow light. The whole thing looked very peculiar and made me feel uneasy. It would make one have a terrifying feeling. And the entire palace of Shengjing was shrouded in this terrible light every evening! I don't admit that I am a timid person, but seeing this dim and gloomy scene made me uncontrollably have a frivolous fantasy: I thought that the people who had died in these palaces for hundreds of years were about to climb up one by one like ghosts in deep mountains and valleys. I seemed to have seen many strangely shaped black shadows shaking in front of me, causing me to tremble uncontrollably. I suspected that this unstable feeling of mine was a sign of some misfortune tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the main hall where the Empress Dowager lived, although the same candles were used and the same horn lanterns were used, these lanterns were not hanging above, but were installed on a dozen lamp stands. The style of these lamp stands was very special. The raw material was red sandalwood, and there were many patterns on it, but they were different from the ordinary. Although it was also completely surrounded by coiled dragons, they were neither inlaid with gold or silver nor painted with various bright paints, but were directly carved on the wood with knives, so their color was the same as the lamp stand itself, which was black. It didn't look very prominent. If you wanted to appreciate it carefully, you had to bring your eyes close to see it clearly. It was best to touch it with your fingers so that you could especially recognize the workmanship and refinement of these carvings. (181)</p>
<h3 id="e193">The Landlord's Family <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>I recently moved to Huxi and rented three Shanghai-style [local houses] on a road built across the boundary. The front faced the concession's road, and the houses were located on the Chinese territory. Behind the houses was a large open space, which the landlord used to grow vegetables.</p>
<p>Speaking of our landlord, he is quite interesting. The landlord is an old man of nearly fifty. It is said that he has more than ten mu of ancestral land in the Huxi area, each mu worth an average of more than 10,000 yuan, so the ten mu of land are worth about 200,000 yuan. These lands are all rented out to people, and the annual rent income is more than 10,000 yuan. But the old man wears a black cotton-padded coat and trousers, cloth socks, and cloth-soled shoes, and smokes yellow tobacco costing more than 100 cash a day. Watering, weeding, and harvesting in the vegetable garden and then carrying them to the market to sell are his only jobs.</p>
<p>His wife and his eldest granddaughter spend their time making long ingots and matchboxes every day, in addition to cooking and washing clothes. It is said that they can earn 200 cash a day. His son is a clerk in a foreign company. Although he will have an inheritance worth 200,000 yuan in the future, he has to walk ten miles from his home to the foreign company, regardless of wind, rain, cold, or heat. His daughter-in-law is the mother of seven children, and she does everything herself, from breastfeeding to dressing the children. His eldest grandson and second grandson each studied for three or four years and are now apprentices. They are all apprentices in foreign companies.</p>
<p>I moved from the bustling city to the quiet Huxi and live next to such a family. I almost suspect that I am no longer living in this city.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Glimpses of Tiger Hill (Continued) <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Huoxue Ming</p>
<p>The "Distant Fields in Level Woods" among the Twelve Scenes of Tiger Hill probably refers to this place. To the east of the pavilion, there is also a lookout, where soldiers are stationed. Presumably, from their high vantage point, the sand birds and sails on Taihu Lake, and the inch-sized horses and bean-like people in Suzhou city, cannot escape their gazing eyes.</p>
<p>Circling the short white-powdered wall and passing through the doorway inscribed with "Majestic," that precarious pagoda, resembling a drunken old man, stands quietly in the sunset, its bricks eroded with ancient red, revealing gray-white bones. The mud is covered with weeds from the previous dynasty, and wild birds build nests there, which cannot help but make people linger and sigh. However, the beauty of Tiger Hill Pagoda lies precisely in its incompleteness and tilting. Five years ago, when I came here to pay my respects, I fully expected that this pagoda would soon collapse. Yet today, it still adorns the Seven-Mile Shantang. Although I am still young, I fear I will not have the good fortune to witness the collapse of Tiger Hill Pagoda.</p>
<p>A bit melancholic along the way, I sought out the back door of Xiao Wu Xuan from among the desolate hills and rubble, only to find it guarded by soldiers. I had no choice but to pass through the Chan Temple, following the stone steps of the Fifty-Three Visits, and before my eyes was a blood-red, thousand-person stone, smooth and polished to a lovable degree. Truly, besides Tiger Hill, this piece of stone cannot be found anywhere else. As for the Nodding Stone of myth, the Broken Beam Hall, and the Sword Pond, I find them unremarkable. Especially the Tomb of Zhen Niang and the Tomb of Mandarin Ducks, they hold no meaning to chew on!</p>
<p>Crows fly in the sunset of the crumbling pagoda, and tourists gradually disperse. Only after the light has completely faded do I return to the gate. (The End)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e195">Early Winter Exhibition <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Hui</p>
<p>The bright maple leaves, redder than February flowers, and the yellow blossoms under the fence, also compete in five colors, as if the earth is covered in a layer of brocade. Several refined and elegant men have even put on an exhibition to present their treasured horticultural specimens. During these past two weeks, Suzhou has held grand events at the Dongwu and Liuyuan Parks. Now, I will roughly describe some of the exhibits, to provide an on-paper appreciation for those who love horticulture.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums</p>
<p>The varieties of chrysanthemums are truly numerous, and the colors and forms of the flowers are splendid and beautiful, each extremely exquisite. The varieties of chrysanthemums can be roughly divided into ten types: silk, ribbon, horn, petal, tube, claw, hair, ball, ruyi, and mixed color. The "silk" chrysanthemum has petals that droop like tassels, possessing a scattered and unrestrained charm; varieties like "Ten-Foot Pearl Curtain," "White Dragon Whiskers," and "Disordered Clouds" belong to this category. The "ribbon" chrysanthemum has petals that are shorter and wider than silk, spreading out boldly and exuding a refined and elegant beauty; there are varieties like White Jade Ribbon and Qilin Ribbon. The tip of the petal has a distinct corner, which is the "horn" chrysanthemum; varieties like Qilin Horn and Great Azure Dragon possess a magnificent posture. The "petal" chrysanthemum, in terms of its bearing, is too full of rich and noble air, lacking the hidden and reclusive charm. However, the large flower heads and broad petals have a kind of dignified and luxurious aura. This type of flower includes "Eighteen Petal Lotus," "Sprinkled Gold Eighteen Petal," "Green Peony," and "Snow Azure Lotus." The "tube" flower has hollow petals like tubes. Among the fine chrysanthemums, this variety is not particularly wonderful. Varieties like "Laojun Eyebrow" are very difficult to cultivate. Among the forms of chrysanthemums, the most flying, dancing, and majestic are undoubtedly the "claw" chrysanthemums. The petals of the claw chrysanthemum spread out like claws. This type of chrysanthemum generally has large flower heads and a majestic posture. Varieties include "White Dragon Claw" and "Bearded Dragon." The "hair" chrysanthemum has fine hairs growing on its petals, and includes the Yellow Hair and Green Hair varieties, which are also very beautiful in form. The "ball" flower has petals that are evenly curved and clustered together, forming a shape like a ball, which is very endearing. The "ruyi" chrysanthemum has long branches, but the flowers are small and exquisite, resembling a long-handled ruyi scepter. "Mixed color" chrysanthemums have two colors on one flower, such as "Green Robe and Red Skirt," which is light green on the outside but scarlet on the inside. "Er Qiao" has a mix of red and white, which is strangely beautiful. In addition, there are artificial tie-dyed flowers. The large ones are over a hug in circumference and almost as tall as a person, but they are too vulgar and inevitably lose the reclusive flavor of chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>Goldfish</p>
<p>In addition to the "Dragon," "Egg," and "Grass" varieties of goldfish, there are also "Pearl Fish" and "Swallowtail Fish." The scales of the pearl fish are raised one by one, round like grains of pearls; this type of goldfish is very difficult to raise. At this park's fish and chrysanthemum exhibition, the pearl fish from the Sun residence of Sijing Lane were displayed on two tables. The larger ones were nearly a foot long, which is certainly no easy feat. Although the swallowtail fish have single tails, they are particularly long and large. When swimming, they are graceful and supple, with a leisurely attitude. The violet fish are the beloved goldfish of the Violet Orchid owner, with purple spots all over their bodies. Swimming among the green algae, they have a unique and magnificent appearance. The "piled jade" fish have soft flesh piled on their heads, like a tiger's head. The "pom-pom" fish have round fleshy balls growing on either side of their mouths. They come in two varieties: loose and tight, and the large ones are the size of longans. In addition, there are "turned gills" and "bubble eyes." The gills of the "turned gill" fish are completely turned outward. The eyeballs of the "bubble eye" fish are like two soft bubbles of water. When swimming in the water, the two eyeballs can expand and contract softly. It is said that if one is not careful, they will break the bubbles and become blind fish. In addition, there is a type called "red hat," whose entire body is silver and whose head is red, as if wearing a red hat; the color is particularly bright.</p>
<p>Melons and Fruits</p>
<p>In addition to goldfish and chrysanthemums, winter melons and pearl melons are also exhibits these days. The color of the winter melon is so vermilion and fresh; the pearl melon is a variant of the winter melon. The forms vary in size, and the colors vary in yellow and white. On the outside of the melon, there are small round pearls. Matched with various porcelain pots, they are also pleasing to the eye. In this autumn wind and when ducks and crabs are fat, holding wine while admiring chrysanthemums and judging fish is indeed a pleasure in life. "Life is for pleasure." Why seek fame and fortune and bring trouble upon oneself in this world?</p>

<h3 id="e196">CU Secures the Jiangda All-Around Championship <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>CU monopolizes the top four places in the pentathlon</p>
<p>The competition continues today, but the results are average</p>
<p>The Jiangda Athletic Association's all-around games began yesterday at Chizhi University on Shuidaidian Road in this city. As the host, Chizhi provided very thoughtful arrangements and hospitality. Yesterday, the pentathlon and decathlon preliminary rounds, as well as the 1600-meter relay, were held. CU dominated, and there is no doubt that they will win the championship. Furthermore, the top four places in the pentathlon were all taken by CU athletes, and the relay championship also went to CU. Unfortunately, the results were average, which is regrettable. The decathlon final round and the 400-meter relay and distance medley relay exhibition will continue this afternoon at 2:00 PM. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Pentathlon</p>
<p>Since the graduation and departure of Wang Jihuai, Hao Chunde, and others, there is no hereditary tradition among the schools in Shanghai. As the saying goes, "In the Shu region, there are no great generals, so Liao Hua acts as the vanguard," but after all, he has not achieved much. Therefore, the championship is firmly in the hands of CU. However, it was unexpected that they could monopolize the top four places. Zhang Jiechun only managed to seize the first place with 2199.236 points. The other athletes did not even break the 2000-point mark, which is regrettable. The results of the top four are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Zhang Jiechun: 2199.236 points</p>
<p>2. Xiong Jinguo: 1817.664 points</p>
<p>3. Zhou Qiao: 1738.156 points</p>
<p>4. Yang Yongcan: 1696.71 points</p>
<p>Decathlon Preliminary Round</p>
<p>Even if CU cannot monopolize the top four places in this event, they can at least take two or three. Currently, the championship and runner-up positions are most likely to go to Shen Fei, Liu Yingjie, and Deng Kanshun. Liu currently has 2669.73 points, and Deng has 2558.67 points. The two will have intense competition.</p>
<p>1600-Meter Relay</p>
<p>Due to the even distribution of talent, CU won first place in the 1600-meter relay with a time of 3 minutes 48.4 seconds. The result was quite average. Only three schools participated. Guanghua was second, and Chizhi was third. The lineups of each team are as follows:</p>
<p>CU: First Leg: Ge Qu; Second Leg: Xi Jialu; Third Leg: Hu Shixuan; Fourth Leg: Tian Hanzhang</p>
<p>Guanghua: Sun Zhaoxuan, Shen Bingyan, Zhu Zhangling, Dong Shuzhao</p>
<p>Chizhi: Huang Yicheng, Huang Dewan, Nong Jinan, Wu Du</p>
<p>Scores of Each School</p>
<p>CU scored a total of 22 points in the pentathlon, plus 10 points for the 1600-meter relay, for a total of 32 points. Guanghua received 6 points for second place in the relay, and Chizhi received 4 points for third place in the relay. Jinling University and Nanda University both scored zero points. University sports today can be said to be extremely bleak.</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>1. 110-Meter Hurdles (Decathlon); 2. 1500-Meter Distance Medley Relay (Final); 3. Discus Throw (Decathlon); 4. Pole Vault (Decathlon); 5. Javelin Throw (Decathlon); 6. 1500 Meters (Decathlon); 7. 400-Meter Relay (Final)</p>

<p>The weather in Shanghai is cold, and there are fewer opportunities to swim than in South China. However, good results must come from consistent practice. Therefore, the team is taking advantage of the opening of the Zhongqing heated pool and specially negotiated with Mr. Ling Xizhi, starting yesterday, for the team to practice temporarily from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM every night. They will also review the results of each swimmer every week to encourage them, hoping to create a new situation next season.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Nanxing still defeated by McLean <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>55 to 27 points</p>
<p>Two Group A matches tonight</p>
<p>One of the main matches last night in the Xiqing Basketball League was the Group A match between Nanxing and McLean. Before the match, Nanxing had hoped for victory, as Nanxing had made visible progress recently, while McLean was entirely composed of new players. Unexpectedly, after a hard-fought battle, Nanxing was still defeated by McLean by a score of 55 to 27, indicating that McLean's strength is still not weak. Nanxing's defeat was due to the players' short stature, which was a disadvantage to begin with. In addition, facing a tall opponent, they became flustered, missing countless shots and free throws. Being flustered on the court was a major problem. Liu Jingfeng was the more commendable player. As for McLean, although they are a new team, they are tall and very agile, making their attack quite formidable. Their shooting was also more accurate, clearly above Nanxing. After the start of the match, McLean took the lead with 7 to 2, but as a result of Nanxing's courageous defense, they caught up to 7 to 9, only two points behind. However, they were ultimately unable to break McLean's heavy pressure. After 15 to 7, the first half ended with 19 to 11, with McLean in the lead. In the second half, McLean suddenly added 10 points, and Nanxing fell into a state of inevitable defeat. The score widened, and they eventually lost by a score of 55 to 27.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Shandong Qilu University Uproar Situation <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Students Petition the Board of Directors to Demand a Formal President</p>
<p>Currently in a State of Idleness, Difficult to Resolve Immediately</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch) Student representatives from Qilu University today visited Li Zhifan, the vice-chairman of the school's board, and important figures in the provincial government, requesting assistance in resolving the president issue to avoid affecting the students' future. Li Xingxi, a member of the board, negotiated to convene a full board meeting and requested the reinstatement of President Lin Jiqing, but was refused. Li also resigned, and the uproar is expanding, with a pessimistic outlook.</p>
<p>[Jinan Letter] Shandong Qilu University suddenly experienced a student movement today (the 20th). Although it doesn't appear to be particularly serious, considering the school's past reputation, students would not rashly initiate such action unless absolutely necessary. It is rumored that this is solely due to the president issue. Since Acting President Lin left the school last semester, there has been no one in charge. The student roster after the summer break should normally be submitted to the province for referral to the Ministry for record-keeping, but due to the absence of a formal president, the Education Department cannot forward it and has repeatedly extended the deadline, which is now imminent. For the sake of their future and studies, the students felt compelled to unite and express themselves. Therefore, at 9:30 AM today (the 20th), they gathered in front of Zhiguo Building on campus to make a peaceful request to the board of directors. The issue remained unresolved until 3:00 PM. When the reporter arrived, Li Zhifan (the vice-chairman of the school's board) was addressing the students. According to the Student Union, this is by no means a personal issue, but rather a demand for someone to be responsible as president. The students' actions are not comparable to typical disturbances, and they are not supporting any particular faction. They simply seek mutual understanding among all parties so that the school can be officially registered. As of the time of this dispatch, it is reported that Li Zhifan has gone to Qitaiguan. Given this situation, without concrete measures, it is feared that a resolution will be difficult to achieve in the short term.</p>
<p>General Situation of Qilu University: Shandong Qilu University was founded long ago, thirty to forty years before the establishment of the Republic of China, originating from the Wenhuitang in Dengzhou. Seven years before the establishment of the Republic, it merged with the Guangde Academy in Qingzhou and moved to Weixian, renaming itself Guangwen Academy, which was the predecessor of the College of Arts and Sciences. The School of Medicine was formed by merging the medical school run by Dr. Nie of the American Presbyterian Church in Jinan, the medical school of the Baptist Church in Qingzhou, funding from the Beijing Union Medical College, and students, as well as the medical department of Jinling University and the Datong Hospital in Hankou. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, the Theological Seminary and Guangwen Academy in Qingzhou both moved to Jinan, thus combining the four colleges of Arts, Sciences, Medicine, and Theology to form Qilu University. In the twelfth year, the North China Union Women's Medical School was also merged into the school's medical department. In the eighteenth year, according to an order from the Ministry of Education, the Department of Theology was separated. At the end of the twentieth year, the Ministry of Education approved its registration as a private university. Currently, funding is provided by the United Church Board for World Ministries of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Luo Shi Foundation, and various departments of the Chinese government. The board of directors includes Chinese directors Li Zhifan, Yi Zhenqing, Tan Shukui, etc., and Westerners Aibadi, Sikaoti, William, etc. Kong Xiangxi is the chairman of the board. However, recently, the position of president has been vacant for a long time, and no one is formally responsible for school affairs. The student roster after the summer break could not be submitted to the Ministry for record-keeping as usual because there was no official presidential seal. Therefore, there have been some joint actions to make demands to the board of directors.</p>
<p>Causes of the Dispute: Since President Zhu Jingnong left Qilu University, Lin Jiqing, the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, has been serving as acting president for two years and has achieved considerable success. On June 15th of this year, a board meeting was held, but only a few people attended to discuss the issue of the president. However, the board members could not reach a consensus. Acting President Lin decided to resign. The majority advocated for retaining Lin to continue maintaining the situation. Provincial Chairman Han Fuju, Education Director He Siyuan, Construction Director Zhang Honglie, and Finance Director Wang Gerong also telegraphed Kong Xiangxi, stating their intentions. On August 15th, another board meeting was held, with all directors in attendance, and Minister Ye also telegraphed Jinan. At that time, it was passed that Lin Jiqing would be the formal president immediately. Lin initially agreed to consider it, but it was rumored that after the start of the semester, some members of the board did not express sympathy towards him. Therefore, Lin went to Shanghai to take care of matters at the Central Bank, and Kong felt that the internal situation was complex, so he also decided to resign from the position of chairman. Around October, it was heard that the Standing Board of Directors had resolved to invite Minister Ye to become chairman and invited President Lin back to the school. De Weisi and Yi Zhenqing went to Shanghai to urge him. At that time, Lin's intention was to follow Kong's will to be chairman, while Minister Ye's intention was that if Lin returned to the school, he could take on the position of chairman. After De Weisi and others returned to Shandong, Minister Kong intended to ask the board of directors to nominate two people to go to Beijing, where Kong would personally explain and resolve internal differences. However, the Western board members firmly refused to go and recently convened a meeting of a few board members to overturn the resolutions of several previous meetings and appoint another acting president, failing to follow the resolutions of the full board meeting, abandoning the proper path. The position of acting president is indeed extremely difficult to fill, and after the summer break, numerous matters await the handling of a formal president. This is why the students are urgently demanding a resolution.</p>
<p>Recent Situation: Qilu University students have historically had strengths and weaknesses. Their strength lies in their focus on studies and their disinterest in external affairs. However, at times, large-scale groups are not easily united. This time, their joint demand for the board of directors to promptly appoint a president shows that their emotions have reached an extreme and tense state. Without a formal president, the student roster cannot be submitted to the province for referral to the Ministry, which is disturbing to the students. This is not a disturbance or a strike but only a minimal request to the board of directors, a formal and peaceful expression. Yesterday (the 20th) at 9:30 AM, male and female students gathered in the dormitories and went to the school's office building. At that time, while the board of directors was in session, representatives from the Student Union Congress and the Student Union Executive Committee submitted a petition. When they were received, only four members of the board of directors were present, which did not meet the legal quorum, and all were Westerners. At that time, the students questioned that the school had been without a president for more than a day. At the last full board meeting (August 15th), it was resolved to retain Minister Kong Xiangxi as chairman and to retain Lin Jiqing as president. Since the dispatch of representatives was resolved by the board of directors, why did this meeting overturn the opinions of the majority with a few people? Second, the representatives went to Beijing and Shanghai to retain Kong and Lin, respectively, and Kong and Lin both had intentions to act. Why did the board of directors ignore this, resulting in the student roster not being submitted to the Ministry? This is not a fact of non-permission but an error by the board of directors. Third, they questioned how the board of directors, unwilling to sacrifice its prejudices, would resolve the students' personal roster, which could not be submitted to the Ministry. However, the board of directors did not provide a satisfactory response to this. The students agreed to stay in front of the office building, standing in the biting cold wind. Not only did the Western board members lack a definite attitude, but their imposing manner was regrettable. After a while, Li Zhifan, the vice-chairman of the school's board, arrived after hearing the news and addressed the students, stating that he had returned to Jinan this morning and that the school's problem was very complex. However, this was a matter for the board of directors itself, and the board members were discussing methods to seek a resolution. Later, he left due to other matters. By about 4:00 PM, the students had not completely dispersed, and the outcome may not be resolved in the short term.</p>

<p>Dr. Jiang Kanghu, former president of Shanghai Southern University, recently returned to China from the United States during the holidays and traveled extensively to scenic spots in various provinces in the north and south. The experiences and insights he published in newspapers and magazines are countless. It is recently learned that many members of the Southern University Alumni Association, recognizing that many young people in the country are suffering from the pain of being out of school, and at a time when the country is facing national crisis and the ruling and opposition parties are vigilant, literature should be particularly promoted. Therefore, it was decided to take advantage of Jiang's visit to Shanghai to invite him to lecture. Thus, Tao Baichuan, Lu Hailan, Wu Xiu, Zhu Bofang, Yang Zunxuan, Xu Taochun, Ye Huang, and Beijing alumni established the Kang Lu Lecture Society. It is learned that Jiang has expressed his agreement to this initiative. The society has already formulated its constitution and officially established it, and the opening ceremony will be held on January 1st next year. Registration locations: 1. Southern University Alumni Association of Shanghai, Haifang Village, Haifang Road, 2. YMCA on Sichuan Road, 3. YMCA on Ba Xian Qiao, 4. Chinese Vocational Education Society on Longhua Road, 5.

<h3 id="e216">Artistic Products <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>In ancient times, critiques of art and literature, poetry, prose, painting, and even calligraphy, were often called something "product," something "product." In terms of poetry, the most famous is Zhong Rong's "Poetry Products," which divided one hundred and three poets from the Han and Wei dynasties to the Liang dynasty into three grades. There is also Sima Kongtu's "Poetry Products," which is divided into more, with twenty-four grades.</p>
<p>The original meaning of the word "product" is numerous. "Shuowen": "Product, the common people, from three mouths." Duan Yucai's note: "Three people are numerous, so from three mouths, associative." The nature of the word "product" is descriptive. Yi Yun: "Products flow and take shape." The extended meaning, as a noun, includes rank, objects, and style; as a verb, it includes evaluation. Although the word "product" used to critique art and literature also has the meanings of objects and style, it mainly refers to rank. This rank is a reflection of the hierarchical system of feudal society.</p>
<p>If the critique is called "product" and the conclusion of the critique is also called something "product," has the original meaning of the word "product" been lost? It is still there in essence. Feudal society is a society of ranks, and the ranks of feudal society are numerous. When numerous ranks are reflected in art and literature, ranks are also numerous. This is one explanation. Criticisms differ from person to person. The ranks of art and literature also differ from person to person. This is called "three people are numerous, so from three mouths." This is another explanation.</p>
<p>Now, the main meaning of the word "product" is object. All manufactured goods are called "products," and art and literature are no exception. All manufactured goods are commodities, and art and literature are still rarely an exception. "Store it in famous mountains, pass it on to its people." The transmission between teachers and disciples in this patriarchal society is already a thing of the past. "Inspiration cannot be sold, but that article can be sold." This common saying quoted in the book "Art and Criticism" is only half right. Because articles can be sold, the inspiration entrusted to them can also be sold. From this perspective, I doubt the words "nature and spirit." Are the "nature and spirit works" of those who flaunt "nature and spirit"—here, the word "product" must be avoided—sold or not? If they are sold, "nature and spirit" also become trademarks.</p>
<p>Some people ask why there are no great creations, and some people scold essays, believing that the absence of great creations is due to the prevalence of essays. The meaning of the absence of great creations is not that there are no creations, but that those that exist are not necessarily great. If this is true, even though they are creations, they are no different from essays. The difference between creation and essays is only a change of form in writing. This is why everyone is writing essays, which are ungreat creations. This can be viewed in the same way as the fate of Chinese industry. The products are of poor quality and small scale.</p>
<p>Because their own industrial products are not good, there is both the popularity of foreign goods and the promotion of domestic goods. In art and literature, there are both people engaged in creation and people engaged in translation. However, this cannot be viewed in the same way. Industry is constrained by foreign countries, but the facts are clear: should we promote domestic goods, improve domestic goods, and adopt Western methods, or should we continue to use local methods?</p>
<p>Artistic products have been determined to be commodities. Of course, we should not regard them as sacred just because they are not like this, but we do not need to think that this is an insult. Commodities cannot be treated as the same. They include luxury goods manufactured for special people, vulgar crude products, and products that are in between.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Catching "[Rats]" <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Dangtian</p>
<p>Recently, I came from the north and lived in a friend's house. My friend is nearsighted, and so am I.</p>
<p>One night, my friend came out of the bathroom and said that he saw a big rat inside, asking if I wanted to kill it. I remembered the amusing scene from my childhood of catching a rat, drenching its body with kerosene, and burning it publicly. I also recalled that when I woke up from a dream a few nights ago, I seemed to feel a rat jumping around the bed. So I jumped out of bed, put on my glasses, and said to my friend, "Yes! Yes! Let's do it right away!"</p>
<p>The bathroom and the pavilion room are connected, with only a board wall in between. There is no light in the bathroom, only the light from the pavilion room shines in. Our first action was to close the bathroom door tightly, for fear that the rat would escape. The second action was to start looking for weapons—things to kill the rat with. The two of us stood in the pavilion room and looked for a while, thought for a while, ran to the upper floor and stood for a while, and then went to this room to ask. Finally, my friend held a cookie jar, and I took a broken paper umbrella, pushed open the door and walked in, with him guarding the door and me using the umbrella to stir under the bathtub. Dong! A black-haired "[rat]" about a foot long and weighing more than two pounds jumped out, hit the board wall, and hid back under the bathtub. The "[rat]" was so thick and fierce that my friend was already so frightened that he threw away the jar and stepped on the edge of the bathtub. I was also taken aback, although I still held the broken umbrella tightly in my hand. After the two of us regained our composure, we were surprised to find that such a large "[rat]" was not easy to see. I was afraid that it could only be found in the trenches of the First World War, so I felt that it had to be killed. So my friend borrowed a firewood knife and two pine logs from a landlord, and I took off my slippers and put on a pair of basketball shoes, ready to stomp on it a few times. This time, my friend was still the doorkeeper, holding two pine logs in both hands, I held a broken umbrella in my left hand, and a firewood knife in my right hand. I poked the broken umbrella under the bathtub: no response, I stirred hard, but it was still the same. We suspected that the "[rat]" had escaped when we went to find weapons the second time, but the floor of the bathroom was cement, and there was definitely no hole. The two windows were tightly closed, and we didn't forget to push the door shut when we came out. The locking work was done so tightly that it was really impossible for it to escape, so we persisted and stirred frantically under the bathtub. Dong! The "[rat]" that had appeared just now jumped out again, hit the board wall, and hid under the bathtub. Pine logs, firewood knives, broken umbrellas, and basketball shoes did not show their effect.</p>
<p>My friend said that it was not easy to start and did not want to fight anymore; but I was not willing to give up and asked him to think of a better way together. As a result, he suggested using wooden boards to block the two sides of the bathtub that were not against the wall and pouring a bucket of boiling water down, and the "[rat]" would naturally be scalded to death; I thought there was really no better way than this, so I agreed with him. I stayed there to watch; he went outside to ask the water store to deliver water. After a while, he came back, holding a small iron bar in his hand, followed by a water delivery worker. My friend told him about our "[work]," and he immediately agreed to participate together. This time I was still responsible for searching, and the worker replaced my friend's just position, guarding the door. I still used the broken umbrella as the vanguard, inserted it under the bathtub, and stirred for a long time without seeing any sound. I struck a match to look inside, and a ball of hand-like things curled up in the corner. The worker saw that I was nearsighted and said to me, "Let me do it, give me the matches!" The matches were handed to him. He squatted down, looked at the bottom of the bathtub, struck a match, and immediately said, "Oh! A kitten!" My friend and I were both horrified, looked at each other, and I really can't analyze the mood at that time. "No way?" I woke up from the abyss of disappointment and uttered this sentence. The worker struck another match, shone it on the gap between the wall and the bathtub, poked his head in to look, and still said "A kitten, black!"</p>
<p>My friend laughed, and so did I. A terrible social scene unfolded in my heart. We were thankful that we were not the kitten's destroyers.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Roadside Shop (Part 1) <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>—One of the Memories of a Thousand Cliffs—</p>
<p>A sudden sound of rain hitting a paper umbrella started under the eaves. A bald-headed monk wrapped in a yellow kasaya walked in, loudly yelling "Aha!" Immediately, his muddy feet left a string of muddy footprints on the newly swept floor, along with droplets of water falling from the umbrella. He used a mixture of Bai Yi and Han Chinese everyday phrases, calling out to the owner of the shop [Bifa, bring me a pack of cigarettes!] Then he leaned the wet umbrella against the foot of the bed and plopped down on the bed where the opium lamp was placed. Being stranded in this thatched hut under the Yellow Fruit Tree, dodging the first malarial rain in the Bai Yi region, already made us feel heavy and unhappy. Now, seeing a pair of large feet covered in mud, sticking up high on the edge of the bed, glaringly in front of us, made us even more irritable and uneasy.</p>
<p>A sedan chair carrier, taking advantage of the rain when no one needed a ride, sat by the bamboo window, drilling small holes in a bamboo pole used for carrying people, planning to inject cooked opium, hoping to get past the wild men's patrol at the Xima River. Upon seeing the sudden arrival of the Bai Yi monk, he quickly put aside what he was doing, pretending to be nonchalant, hiding his displeasure, yet revealing it through his pursed lips, muttering a sentence [Even monks are smoking opium,] just as he saw the female owner, whom the Bai Yi monk called Bifa (sister-in-law), displaying the joy of welcoming a distinguished guest, calling him "Buddha, Buddha," trying her best to be gentle and flattering to please him, which made him mutter another indistinct curse.</p>
<p>[Tch, look at that! Humph, old and indecent!]</p>
<p>People from the lower class always love to express their emotions without restraint, which often leads to fights. If a fight broke out in this small roadside shop, it would make it even more unbearable to stay. So, I adopted a calming attitude and patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>[Hey, keep your voice down, the owner's son might hear you!]</p>
<p>Immediately, two other people, his partner and a private opium seller who yawned all day long, couldn't help but burst into laughter. At the same time, I noticed the female owner's son, turning his rough, thirty-year-old face from his shoulder, showing an embarrassed expression, quickly turning back, still sitting by the earthen stove with his head lowered, guarding the vigorously bubbling opium pot. Perhaps because they saw his embarrassment, the three of us laughed even harder, a short dry tobacco pipe trembling in his hand, actually falling to the ground.</p>
<p>[Laughing your mouth off, how will you be able to pee in sheets?]</p>
<p>The female owner ran over, grabbed one person's ear with one hand, pulled it hard, and cursed viciously. Then she turned around, grabbed the umbrella by the foot of the bed, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>[Oh dear, what a puddle!]</p>
<p>The man cooking opium didn't even bother to turn his head this time, just anxiously scratching the black turban wrapped around his head, while Jin Bi's small ladle clinked jarringly on the edge of the copper pot holding the opium.</p>
<p>[As if he's only fifteen! Hehe.]</p>
<h3 id="e219">On the Translation of [Don Quixote] <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>The call for a Chinese translation of Don Quixote in Free Talk, if I remember correctly, has already been mentioned twice, including Mr. Miao Lie's [The Translation We Need] on November 15th.</p>
<p>Is there really no fool in China willing to do such a [niche] thing? No, there is. I've seen it with my own eyes. However, he was not fortunate enough to be favored by publishers, so he was not fortunate enough to be known to the public. I think this is probably because the translator is an [unknown person]? This pain, this sorrow, should be shared by many [anonymous] writers and translators.</p>
<p>I still remember the late autumn two years ago. I was unemployed in Guangzhou. Because I was too bored and because I lived on Fangcao Back Street, right across from the back gate of Zhongshan University, I went to the library every day to translate French writer Maurois' biography of Byron. At the same time, there was a thin, slightly dark-skinned young man with thick glasses, who looked like a [impractical] fool, who also came early and returned late, sometimes still sitting in the library at night. He was also tirelessly translating a book. Later, because we ran into each other more often, sometimes because we both fought over a dictionary or encyclopedia, we simply sat together. In those shared moments, I discovered that this foolish gentleman was translating an amazing work, namely Cervantes' Don Quixote.</p>
<p>When I saw him translating this book, I heard that he had been translating it for more than two years, twelve or thirteen hours a day. He had nearly finished translating two volumes of the original text, but he still needed about a year to do the annotations.</p>
<p>His translation style was faithful, at least his attitude was very faithful. I saw him referring to Italian translations, French translations, (he was working from the English translation) I saw him flipping through English dictionaries, French dictionaries, Japanese dictionaries, Spanish dictionaries. I also saw him asking many foreign professors at Zhongshan University. Sometimes I saw him translate less than a thousand words a day, and I was afraid for his [ants moving a mountain] work, fear mixed with admiration, admiring his perseverance in the face of difficulties. Finally, thinking about his ant-like speed, and that he was actually about to reach the end of this long journey, I couldn't help but be happy for him, and I admired him even more.</p>
<p>In the spring of the second year, I finished translating Byron's biography. At the same time, it seemed that he had also finished his annotation work. I ran into him on the street more often than in the library. I saw him sitting in a rickshaw many times, his head drooping, his face gloomy. Later, as I was about to leave Guangzhou and return to Shanghai, I once saw his face light up. Then, the next day, his translation of Don Quixote was published in the supplement of Guangzhou's Republican Daily. I then realized the origin of his gloomy face, and I also learned that his name was [Mo Wu], and that he was just a student at Zhongshan University. Whether Mo Wu is his real name or a pen name, I still have some doubts.</p>
<p>I dare not say that no one went to the library every day to read his translation, but I was one who did every day. I gained a deeper understanding of the faithfulness and fluency of his translation.</p>
<p>I came back to Shanghai, and my biography of Byron was rejected by various bookstores as expected. At the same time, I often thought about the fate of this translator, who was ten times more foolish than I was. Even his fate in the "ass" of the newspaper would probably not be smooth for long, right? Who wants to read this dull (!) and lengthy translation that is neither "[I love]" nor "[His mother's]?"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, someone actually asked for a Chinese translation of Don Quixote in Free Talk. I felt a surge of infinite joy for Mr. Mo Wu, and another tremor of heartbreaking sadness.</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Cripple (2) (Written by Zsigmond Moricz) <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Uncle Zhuang</p>
<p>Now I must confess that I was staring blankly at him. This one thousand acres of land only supported three workers last winter. But what was that "half person" he just mentioned?</p>
<p>[Ah! Yes,] he said with a smile, [that cripple… my cripple… he was originally a villager in my family… When the rural reform measures were implemented, our landlord mainly wanted us to take in a cripple, so we could get a few extra [acres]. In this way, we could save a piece of land that would have been used to support this cripple. For me, he earned me sixty [acres]… For him, it was also a good deal, because his livelihood was solved… He only had one foot left, injured during the Great War (i.e., the World War from 1914 to 1918—Translator), and received 100% compensation from the government.]</p>
<p>Earning sixty [acres] from a cripple is indeed no trivial matter.</p>
<p>Passing in front of the cowshed, I saw a strange little mud hut. I thought it was a house for storing potatoes, corn, or wheat. But a chimney on the roof was emitting smoke.</p>
<p>[What is this?] I asked.</p>
<p>[This is where the cripple lives,] the landlord said, [the place where the cripple lives.]</p>
<p>[Can I go in?]</p>
<p>[Of course.]</p>
<p>The small hut had a door so small that one could barely enter by folding the body in half. We arrived at a tiny room that served as both a kitchen and a living room, but the largest part was occupied by the stove and a large laundry tub.</p>
<p>A door on the right led to a small corner. A happy little woman with a radiant face emerged from that tiny corner.</p>
<p>[Good day, gentlemen,] she said cheerfully.</p>
<p>[Good day, madam,] I said, [may we be allowed to visit your house?]</p>
<p>[Come in, come in,] she replied, [this is a small but lovely house…] Then she stepped aside to let us in.</p>
<p>The house didn't even have a small loft for storing杂物. The mud roof was finely plastered with lime. The only window was no bigger than a handkerchief worn as decoration in a coat pocket. A bed, a table, two chairs, and a small cabinet were all the furniture. In fact, that room could only fit this much.</p>
<p>[How many people live here?]</p>
<p>[My husband and I, and three children.]</p>
<p>[This is the only thing they know how to do,] the landlord said with [a touch of displeasure], [having children! Three in four years, not bad!]</p>
<p>[Ah! Sir!] the woman replied, putting her hand洁地 to her mouth where her front teeth were missing, [we've been married for five years.]</p>
<p>At this moment, someone came to find the landlord; a cow was giving birth. Looking worried, the landlord left, because a cow was a valuable thing.</p>
<p>[Please sit down,] the woman said to me, pointing to a chair.</p>
<p>I sat down.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Financial Market Gold and Metal Rise Then Fall <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Rumor Lihmai to Pay a Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Major Players Take Advantage of High Prices to Sell Forcefully</p>
<p>Resulting in a Fall of Three Yuan and Fifty Cents</p>
<p>The gold market's heart is still steady. The possibility of a ban on the export of cash means that HSBC Bank has to forcefully sell. Recent local exchange rates are firm, and major players are still selling, so the price drop is also quick. Initially, overseas silver markets in England and America rose uniformly, with the Canadian forward silver price rising by 4.5%. Exchange rates also rose. However, London spot gold fell by two pence. Over-the-counter preliminary trading opened high and immediately dropped to 923 yuan. Major players like Fuxing, Yongyi, and Fengyong sold aggressively, but because there were many buyers taking advantage of the low prices, the price was maintained. The Central Bank's posted rate revealed that England and America were flat, and the customs gold unit fell by two cents. The standard price of gold fell to 1004 yuan and two cents. The morning opened with lower prices, and buyers were quite active. After opening, the price gradually rose. Banks were quite willing to sell. The exchange market was unusually strong, and there was quite a bit of supply in the middle. HSBC Bank's posted rate revealed that England rose by 1.25. Le Chang moved, and the buying enthusiasm increased sharply. Rumors spread again in the market, claiming that without the official request of the local chamber of commerce, cash funds would not be circulated. The price surged, even breaking through the 1000 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, major players took advantage of the high prices to sell aggressively, and banks seized the opportunity to sell at high prices, pushing the price back down below 1000 yuan. The local bank rate was still loose, and then it fell again. However, because the silver equalization tax was announced and had not been changed, there was still some rebound. Unexpectedly, due to the unusual tightness of the money supply, banks urgently wanted to sell recent US dollar exchange rates, and the local rate continued to be strong. At noon, the situation was weak again. Later, rumors of a ban on silver spread again, and the local rate immediately tightened. Major players entered the market, and the price was pushed up to over 1000 yuan twice. However, there was sudden pressure taking advantage of the high prices, and banks' appetites were still tight. The initial report of the Indian silver price rising by 6.7 annas, and the exchange market turned loose, gradually falling back, but there was some short covering after the low, which allowed it to pull up. Banks' appetites were also tight and mutually exclusive. The second report of the Indian silver price rising by 2.1 annas. At this time, the overall trend was mediocre, with fluctuating ups and downs. Finally, because Reuters telegraphed that there were rumors in this city of a ban on exporting cash without permission, buyers were slightly eager, and the market was pulled up at the close, but it did not exceed the 1000 yuan mark. After the close, it was rumored that Chinese banks held 87% of the cash reserves, while foreign banks held only 13%. If so, foreign banks would inevitably continue to print and sell exchange bills to obtain cash. The prospects for the exchange market seemed to have hope of loosening, so selling sentiment was slightly stronger, and the market price fell slightly. The overall trend for the day was volatile, and although the rumors were beneficial to the long side, fueling buying sentiment, major players took the opportunity to sell off at high prices, and the exchange market loosened, so the rising trend was temporary, and the market situation was hovering. People's hearts are still firm, the underlying momentum is still strong, and the trend is difficult to predict. Now, after recording the market situation for the day,</p>
<p>The morning opened at 991 yuan, a drop of four yuan from the previous close. Although Yuan Yi and others sold, it soon fell back to 07 cents. Qingyu and Tianfeng vigorously bought, rising to Dalian and then immediately selling. It fell back to 1 yuan. Zhaofeng, Changheng, Yufu, Changfu, Yu Bao, Xingyuan, Changyong, Dingkang, Fuxing, Yong Meiyu and others advanced to 4.5 yuan. In anticipation of HSBC's posted rate, England rose by 1.25, and America rose by 3.125. The local market rate was still firm, and Dafa, Yongheng, Yu Shunmao sold off, falling to 5 yuan. However, the buying enthusiasm was still strong, and through purchases by Yuan Chang, Yongfu, Xing Yong, Tongchun, Heng Yu, Tian Feng, Yongli and others, it rose to 7.8 yuan. Yuan Mao and Yong Zhaofeng Chang sold to 6 yuan, but soon rumors spread again that cash could not be transported to other ports. Fuxing, Yong Yuan Chang, Yongheng Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, Zhaofeng Chang, Dafa Yong and others competed to buy, even surging to 1003.9 yuan. Yuanchun, Fuyu, and Fuan supplied, falling back to 1.5 yuan. Heng Yu, Fuxing, Yong Dingkang still paid, and it rose again to 2.8 yuan. Bibi Sai sold February US dollars at 25. Fuxing, Yongheng, Xingyuan, Dafa, Yong Shunmao and others sold aggressively, falling to 996.7 yuan. The silver equalization tax was announced unchanged. Heng Yu, Fuxing, Yong Dadecheng advanced to over 9 yuan. At this time, because the Dalian gang supplied, there was quite a bit of struggle. Huabi came out with November US dollars at 4375, and gradually went downstream from 9.3 yuan. Shunmao, Yuan Changyong, Zhaofeng Chang, Dadecheng, Fuxing, Yong Fuyu, Tongyi and others sold one after another, passing to 3.3 yuan. Zhengjin sold different January US dollars at half a yuan. Fuxing, Yong Qingyu, Zheng Chang, Dadecheng and others advanced to 6 yuan. Shunchang, Dafa, Yong Yicheng sold off, and it dropped again to 3 yuan. Nei Xing and others came in at low prices, and the noon close rose again to 994.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 996.1 yuan. Fuchang, Zheng Chang, Dalian Gang and others came in. January shillings at 0625 and US dollars at 3125 were difficult to settle. Rumors spread again in the market that the outflow of silver was prohibited, and it rose to 1000.5 yuan. Fuxing, Yong Tongyi sold off, falling back to 998.8 yuan. Yifeng Yong Tongtai Chang entered. It was rumored that speculator Wu came in, and it rose again to 1000.8 yuan. Citibank sold February shillings at 4 pence. Fuxing, Yong Shunchang, Xiang Heng, Dafa, Yong Fuyu, Yuan Mao Yong Heng Xing, Zheng Chang and others sold off together, gradually falling back to 4.8 yuan. Bombay also rose by 6.7.7 annas. Dadecheng and Fuxing Yong came in, rising to 7.8 yuan. Bing Xing, Qian Chang, Xiang Zhaofeng Chang supplied, falling to 6 yuan. Although Dafa Yong advanced to 7.9 yuan, Bombay rose again by 2.1.1 annas. Dalian Zhentai supplied, falling to 5.7 yuan. There was news from Mecca and this city that the flow of silver to any port was prohibited. Dafa, Yong Fuxing, and Yong others bought in one after another, rising back to 9.2 yuan. After Tianfeng Yong and others sold off, the closing price was 998.5 yuan. After the close, it was suddenly rumored that Chinese banks held 87% of the cash, and foreign banks held only 13%. The exchange market looked strong, and selling sentiment was strong again. Heng Xing also had a supply, falling to 7 yuan. It was found that the highest price for the day was 1003.9 yuan, and the lowest price was 990.7 yuan, with a total fluctuation of 13.2 yuan. As a result, it closed up 3.5 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was posted by the Central Bank's standard gold price, falling back to 1004.2 yuan. In terms of the closing price, it was about 6 yuan short, about 5 yuan less than the previous close. The registered price for December was 991 yuan, and the registered price for January was 994 yuan. The morning top-up was 991 yuan, and the afternoon top-up was 996 yuan. The spot gold price was 991 yuan. There was still a lack of trading in the market, mainly because there were few sellers of spot goods. Generally, Tianjin goods were about 2.5 yuan extra, but there were also few sellers. With the unusual tightness of the money supply, the trend was very weak. The swap was given by Dachangxiang to Qian Changxiang at 21 bars and 7 yuan, and Dadecheng added 105 bars and 7 yuan. In addition, the short position needed to be paid about 8 yuan. There were 7,609 December notes left, with a total of 32 long positions and 9 short positions.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was chaotic, and the psychology of the industry was unstable. Entering and leaving at high prices, Lian Ji, Dingkang, Tongchun, Zhi Chang, Hong Fengyong, Xiang Heyi, Fengyong Xiang, and others held the buying side. Yuan Yi, Fuyu, Dafa Yong, Dachang Xiang, Yongli, Tong Fengheng, Tiancheng, Xiang Xin, Dadecheng, Heng Yu, Hong Xing Shunmao and others were on the selling side. Yifeng Yong, Fuan Dafa, Yong Tongtai Changheng Changyong went out first and then entered. Renfa Yong, Tian Feng Huixiang, Heng Xing advanced and then exited. The Dalian gang Wanxing made about 2,000 bars, sold after rolling over. Shunli made less than 1,300, rolled out more than 200. Shun Pingsheng made more than 100 each in and out, and Heng Xing entered more than 100, closing a small number. The total number of transactions for the day was 56,322 in the morning market and 25,725 in the afternoon market. The total number of January futures chips was 25,921, with a total of 58 long parties and 53 short parties.</p>

<p>Foreign Banks Eager to Sell</p>
<p>The Whole Day's Process Is Quite Rigid</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign telegrams, the London market's nearby and distant rates both rose by 1.875, the US silver spot rate rose by half a cent, and the forward silver price also rose by 4.5%. London spot gold fell by two pence, while the British pound rose against the US dollar by 875 points. The US dollar rose against the British pound by 875 points, the British pound rose against the French franc by 16 pounds sterling, and the US dollar was unchanged against the French franc. The exchange market opened with a selling price for the nearby rate of one shilling and four pence and one-eighth of a cent, and the US dollar at 33.5 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was up 0625 and the US hard currency was up one-eighth of a cent. The Central Bank's posted rate revealed that the British pound and the US dollar were both flat, and the customs gold unit fell by two cents. After work, the rate hardened again, and the banks' appetites were tight, while the appetite of Chinese businessmen was very weak. After entering, HSBC Bank's posted rate revealed that the British pound rose by one-eighth of a cent, and the heavenly path by three-eighths of a cent. Although the banks continued to sell, people's hearts suddenly showed a reaction. Rumors spread again, such as the claim that cash could not be transported for export without the official request of the Chamber of Commerce. After this, the rate once turned tight, but the banks took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the silver equalization tax was announced unchanged. After this, the rate gradually became anxious to sell, and with few buyers, the trend hardened again. The overall trend was near loose and far tight. In the afternoon market, Chinese businessmen continued to push up the price, and rumors of a silver ban started again. The market immediately tightened, but the banks still had a considerable appetite to sell. The silver rose by six or seven annas. After tightening, the rate loosened again. After entering, the banks' appetites were not uniform. Although the silver rose again by 2.1 annas, people's hearts were still stable, and the market situation was flat. Finally, Reuters also telegraphed about the rumors in this city of a ban on exporting silver. The underlying momentum was still good, and the closing price for the nearby spot rate was one shilling and four pence and one-sixteenth of a cent, and the US dollar was 33.5 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was flat and the US dollar was slightly looser by one-eighth of a cent. However, the forward rate had already rebounded, with the difference of shillings being more than 0625 and the difference of US dollars being more than .25. This was because the money supply was tight, and the foreign banks were eager to sell the nearby rates. The Chinese businessmen cleared about 100,000 shillings and 600,000 to 700,000 US dollars. Now, the transaction records are listed below:</p>

The foreign exchange interest rate was consistently two cents and five fens in both the morning and afternoon markets, a good increase of two fens compared to the previous day.

<h3 id="e225">Domestic Circulation of Silver Requires Permits <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, many were preparing to ship back through customs—</p>
<p>This year's large-scale export of silver has been significant, as repeatedly reported in the newspapers. After the customs authorities, acting on orders, increased the export tax, it decreased. However, in the most recent month or so, the continuous transport of silver to various locations has been incessant, and the amount is considerable. Yesterday, the Chaozhou and Guangdong Hakka merchant groups declared to a certain British shipping company that they were shipping 300 boxes of silver dollars, scheduled to be exported today. As they were in the process of clearing customs and loading the ship, the customs suddenly received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that silver being transported to various domestic ports must have a permit from the Ministry of Finance before it could be shipped out. As a result, the customs authorities detained the silver dollar customs declarations, ordering the merchants to obtain permits, otherwise the goods would be returned. They all stopped loading. It is reported that some dozens of boxes were rerouted to Hong Kong, paying taxes there.</p>

<p>Short squeezes are more prevalent than long squeezes.</p>
<p>Hedging favors the long side.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the high interbank lending rates, the intention was to list at 25 cents, seemingly higher than the continued rise. Generally, it was believed that the rumors of silver exports would cause a reversal in the afternoon. After initially rising, it fell, ending at only 15 cents, suddenly reassuring the market. Bond prices fluctuated wildly in response. In reality, with the settlement date nearing, there was bound to be mutual pressure. The future of interbank lending rates is not expected to ease rapidly. The future of the bond market may temporarily detach from its reliance on interbank lending rates. Both long and short positions are seeking exits due to their positions. With only two days remaining in this month's term, the trend is unlikely to remain adrift. However, most large long and short positions have already found suitable settlements, so the pressure in the future will be limited. Yesterday, short squeezes were more prevalent than long squeezes. Hedging favored the long side. In the morning's first session, due to the increase in interbank lending rates, the front row (referring to contracts) from the 50th was aggressively sold down by 1 to 3 cents. Starting from customs supervision (referring to contracts), the 21st started buying in, suddenly reversing the situation and rising by 1 to 3 cents. In the second session, the 50th and 53rd were sold off, while the 20th, 21st, and 48th were bought in. The market price uniformly rebounded by 12 cents to half a yuan. The afternoon opening saw a reversal, closing at only a fraction of a cent, suddenly raising market sentiment. The 19th military bond (善) sharply rose by half a yuan. Later, due to continued selling, it weakened slightly, but the closing was stable, with highs and lows seen. Trading volume also decreased slightly. As a result, market prices uniformly rebounded, except for a slight decrease of 13 cents for the current month contract of the 19th Guan Shan, ranging from 12 cents to half a yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated at around 20 million yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared in the table below (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>A report from the New Feng Foreign Firm states that yesterday (the 21st), the New York stock market remained mixed. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. continued to issue a dividend of $2.50 per share. Furthermore, due to increased production of copper and iron, and electricity production breaking the high record of the past 200 weeks, some stocks trended upwards. Early in the morning, speculators anticipated a decline in railway freight and shorted railroad stocks, making it difficult for the market to rally. It has been found that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's profits are insufficient to cover the dividend, so the dividend is taken from the public reserve fund. The bond market also saw mixed gains and losses, with special bonds being quite strong. U.S. government bonds rebounded by several cents. Demand for Paramount Pictures bonds was very healthy, as there are rumors of an unchanged reorganization plan. The smaller exchanges were mixed. Chicago wheat saw little fluctuation, offsetting the weakening foreign markets and continued domestic drought. The total daily trading volume was 810,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market situation has turned favorable again, with very strong buying pressure. Although there is a strong desire to receive goods this month, the market does not appear particularly tight. With only two trading days left in this month, fluctuations are unpredictable. The purchase of raw cotton by various parties is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Good at 578 cents</p>
<p>The pre-market trading of blended yarn was tight due to a lack of sellers in the market. Prices for all months rose by 4, 6, 7, and 8 cents. The market remained strong at the afternoon opening due to the trading of over 400 bales of spot yarn, boosting market sentiment. However, the market weakened slightly for near-term contracts near closing, while far-term contracts remained good. Near-term contracts fell by 2 to 3 cents, while far-term contracts rose by 1 cent. The total daily trading volume was estimated at 18,000 bales. It was found that 300 bales were sold by Kang, 400 bales by Changji, 300 bales by Yuande, 850 bales by Run Kang, 200 bales by Yuanda, 300 bales by Jinchang, 350 bales by Jun Chang, and 600 bales by Chang Feng. 400 bales were bought by Mingde, 750 bales by Dafu, 800 bales by Tongji, 1,500 bales by Dafeng, 600 bales by Yuanyi, and 400 bales by Xincheng.

<p>The cotton market is getting stronger, disappointing shorts this month. Moreover, there is insufficient supply for delivery. A portion of coarse cotton is in the hands of financial institutions, making the market relatively strong. Although overseas cotton markets are weak, the local market has not been affected. Most spot cotton has been absorbed by bankers, leading to higher market prices.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao: Short Covering</p>
<p>Pre-market trading of cotton opened with the American cotton market slightly weak, but the Indian cotton market trending upwards. Furthermore, there was a shortage of deliveries by shorts for this month, with more covering, the market remained firm. Far-term contracts were also stimulated. Near-term contracts rose by 15 cents, and linked contracts rose by 35 cents. The market atmosphere remained stable at the afternoon opening, but softened slightly near closing, returning to flat. Far-term contracts fell by 5 cents. The total daily trading volume was estimated at 10,400 bales.

The highest and lowest prices of the day and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Sales Remain Firm</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are stable, with weaker demand from factories, but selling prices are quite high due to high prices at the origin. The origin is estimated at 460 bales of source cotton and 962 bales of Tong cotton. Shandong American cotton 53.25; Public Dafang factory receives 82 pieces; spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<p>Hankou fine cotton 44.50; Shenxin factory receives 200 pieces; spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was quiet as the cloth market was slow, so the producers are waiting for the results of the Punk Case next year. Heard that some powerful members of the new Congress are in favor of continued monetary expansion, so today's market was first weak due to the closure of long positions, then recovered due to purchases by spot merchants. Spot prices are unchanged, futures prices up or down 1 to 4 points. British cotton futures down 3-4 points. Indian cotton initially firm due to buying and short covering by operators in the market, then rose half a rupee. Omra rose 2.25 rupees, and Bai Luoxi rose 1 rupee. Original telegram on the left.

<p>Yesterday's flour market was generally weak. Prices for foreign wheat in Chicago varied by 48 points. Canadian wheat was about 1.5 cents higher. When prices were quoted, near-term contracts weakened slightly. Far-term contracts remained stable as sellers were scarce. In subsequent sessions, the current month saw a slight increase in demand from customer groups and slight replenishment by factories, stabilizing market sentiment. Consecutive contracts saw more outflow of foreign influence, showing a slight decline. By the afternoon opening, there was a rapid decline of 10 points. When prices were quoted, the market was stable. Then came news that the price of spot foreign wheat had loosened for unknown reasons. It was heard that bulk cargo without bags was only quoted at 77 cents. This caused sudden market unease and a shift to selling. The extent of the decline for each month was about 2-3 cents. Following the foreign wheat market, there may still be further declines. The result was that the current month fell 7.5 cents from the previous day, December fell 1.25 cents, January fell 1.75 cents, February fell 2.5 cents, March fell 1.15 cents, and April fell 2 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was flat and stable after the morning opening. Prices for foreign wheat in Chicago varied little, only varying by 4-8 points. Canadian wheat was about 1.5 cents higher. When prices were quoted, the current month weakened slightly due to outflows. Long-term contracts remained calm as both buying and selling were quiet. By the afternoon opening, the current month was tight due to the morning weakness. As the flour market slumped, bids for each month weakened step by step. Forward-term contracts weakened further due to the loosening of foreign wheat prices. As a result, the current month was down 2 cents, December was down 3 cents, January was down 6 cents, and February was down 4 cents. The spot wheat market saw high-quality goods firm, while medium-quality goods were average. Shandong white wheat opened at 3.80 yuan, down to 1 cent.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the various merchants groups came to pre-order a total of about 5,000 stones of goods arriving on the 30th. The sales were like before because the market was still carrying the same attitude, the market did not change. Various Qingdao Jiutai specialized groups purchased four to five bundles. The various groups were bidding a few cents to a dime higher for rice, while the various thick japonica varieties were less attractive because the market had been usually at the same price. High-quality goods were up slightly by a few cents. The middle-grade goods were all stable. The markets for Duyang tip rice and Yinyuan rice were all stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from He Xia on the 16th and 17th were robust in the early market, but turned sluggish in the afternoon market. The sales of Yangdubuting tip rice and thin rice were tepid. The old Baiyuan Yinyuan were more sluggish. There were some brewery customers. The market for white japonica was tight in the early market, but turned tired in the afternoon market. In the end, high-quality goods were stable, while middle- and lower-grade goods were tired and nearly a dime down. The prices for Yangdubuting tip rice, old Baiyuan Yinyuan were fair. The prices for thin rice and early rice were down a few cents.</p>

<p>Customer fragrant rice is down a dime...Foreign rice is down a dime. Yesterday's foreign rice market suddenly turned weak again. Due to the shipment of 2,500 tons of Saigon rice and 400 tons of broken rice by Atusi, totaling nearly 30,000 bags. Moreover, more than 10,000 bags of Yangtze fragrant rice also arrived. There are still two ships, including Atusi, carrying foreign rice on the way, expected to arrive soon. Even customer fragrant rice is being shipped out sporadically. In addition, there are also three or four batches of Annam japonica transported via Hong Kong. Therefore, the market sentiment became unstable. Local customers want to handle this, but stopped again. Yesterday, the market for foreign rice fell by a dime, while the customer fragrant rice fell by a dime to two dimes. Yesterday, the Zhejiang merchant group had a very weak appetite, and after a small price cut, sold 2,000 bags, and Wuxi also sold more than 2,000 bags. Total sales of customer fragrant rice were 7,300 bags, and foreign rice was more than 2,000 bags. The total transaction volume was about 10%. Foreign merchants are still seeking to sell futures rice, but the entry price is very tight, so a deal of 1,600 tons of Saigon forward cargo could not be reached.</p>

<p>Recently, the sales of sesame have been quite strong, due to the activity of foreign installations. Since the procurement began, there have been three or four thousand tons. The procurement is still intermittent, so the market atmosphere is still stable. Yesterday, the auction price was heard to be 7.05 yuan to 6.93 yuan. Zhangba opened at 6.90 yuan, Bengbu sesame at 6.72 yuan, Mingguang sesame at 2.20 yuan, Gaoyou sesame at 6.45 yuan, and Liuhe sesame at 6.60 yuan to 40 cents. A total of more than 2,200 bags were sold. The route for Jiujiang black sesame is only sporadic, so the market is sluggish. There are still four to five thousand bags in stock, making it difficult to develop. The prices for high-quality goods opened at 6.10 yuan and 5 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market turned softer due to the slightly longer Dutch exchange rate and the slight decrease in customs duties. The association set the price for No. 24 raw granulated white spot goods at 18.40 yuan, down 5 cents from the previous day, with some transactions. Re-export cargo was quoted at 5.20 yuan but no deals were made. No. 89 Dutch red sugar was quoted at 14.17 yuan for high-quality goods, with few transactions. Regular grades were quoted at 14 yuan. Re-export cargo was quoted at 4.85 yuan. Taikoo Sugar's B mark also decreased to 19.65 yuan. The price of sugar produced by the local factory was still stable, with Bosu quoted at 16.50 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 at 16.60 yuan, and Qihua Yanyun offered more than 90 bags of Huizhou white sugar at 16.60 yuan, a larger decrease, because of the drop in the price of local cotton white sugar. Chaozhou opened a new arrival of 44 bags of red cotton sugar at 14.60 yuan, and 70 bags of soft green oil-wrapped sugar at 10.80 yuan. Lianbang opened 200 boxes of Wufu white water, each bundle was still 17.80 yuan, according to customer telegrams it was originally planned to increase the price by 1-2 cents, but the red and white sugar are falling, so Jian water cannot rise alone.</p>

<p>Recently, sales of Haikou branches have been sluggish, and the trend is very weak. It was found that a total of more than 4,000 boxes of cargo have arrived one after another. Because the negotiating prices were not in agreement, the goods were kept for a long time and not opened. It is well known that the market is getting more tired with each passing day, and I could not help but invite the bank on the previous day to both parties to open the cargo. The bank saw that the market could not recover well in a short period of time, but only gave a numerical opening. The higher price of the cargo was 17 yuan, the middle price was about 14 yuan, and the lower price was 9 yuan. The other prices were slightly lower, down 1-2 yuan from the previous time.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Banning Corrupt Titles <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Pi</p>
<p>According to the 18th Jing Bao newspaper, "[The interior ministry has recently issued an order to all provinces to ban corrupt titles such as 'Master,' 'Madam,' 'Miss,' and 'Young Master,' to avoid being ridiculed by foreign countries. It is also ordered that in the future, everyone should be referred to as 'Mr.,' 'Old Mr.,' or 'Student.']"</p>
<p>The telegram is brief and may lack detail. I will now extend the meaning of what was publicly stated in the telegram. The need to ban corrupt titles is of course the right thing to do. First, these titles have an exceptionally strong feudalistic color. Second, they expose a kind of class consciousness. An explicit prohibition is extremely reasonable.</p>
<p>However, uniformly calling everyone "Mr." or "Old Mr." still needs to be considered. It is certainly acceptable to refer to all men as "Mr.," but it is inevitably confusing to refer to women as "Mr." Although men and women are now equal, there are physiological differences between the sexes. In my opinion, married women should be called "Mrs. (女先生)," and unmarried women should be called "Ms. So-and-so (某某女士)," or simply "Miss So-and-so (某某小姐)." The word "Miss" does not have a class connotation. Words such as "Elder Sister (大姐)," "Sister (阿姐)," "Fourth Sister (四姐)," and "Third Sister (三姐)" are common terms.</p>
<p>Just as in foreign countries, men are called "Mr.," unmarried women are called "Miss," and married women are called "Mrs.," there is a way to indicate sex. Although our country does not necessarily need to imitate the West, it is natural that there should be a clear distinction between men and women.</p>
<p>As for being ridiculed by foreign countries, that may not necessarily be the case, because customs and habits are different. Foreigners find many of our country's titles and etiquette strange, and our people see many foreigners' titles and etiquette as peculiar. Taking titles as an example, calling someone "Mr." or "Mrs.," or etiquette such as men and women shaking hands when meeting, are now commonplace, but when they were first seen during the early days of trade, they were not necessarily considered strange.</p>
<p>However, exposing feudal colors and displaying unequal concepts are just one aspect of titles. Matters such as weddings, funerals, celebrations, and condolences have not yet had a set of common rituals, and people often follow the old ways of the Qing dynasty and embellish them, with feudal colors and class concepts displayed everywhere. These corrupt rituals should also be strictly prohibited, so that such strange phenomena will not reappear in society. These matters, along with titles, deserve attention.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing to abolish from the feudalistic color is the dress system. The clothes that people wear today are still following the old ways of the Qing dynasty, and it would be best to reform them. Long gowns and mandarin jackets are not considered strange because of habit, but considering the circumstances of the Qing dynasty's entry into China, it is easy to understand why changing clothes was so difficult and opposed by the people. Moreover, the long gown system is based on rules, regulations, and a measured pace, fully expressing a weak attitude. In the past, King Wuling of Zhao advocated wearing nomadic clothing to promote a martial spirit. In today's world of bloodshed, there is no place in the world for weak countries, so the clothing system should also be reformed. This is another matter.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yu</p>
<p>When I was little, my companions and I would catch sparrows. We would set up a net in the yard, sprinkle rice under it, and prop up one corner with a bamboo stick. A rope was tied to the top of the stick and ran into the main room. Several pairs of small eyes would watch from the bright paper window the group of small animals trapped on the roof, calling and flying back and forth, as if discussing whether to risk stealing the food in the trap below. After chirping for a while, the experienced old sparrows would surely warn them that enemies were lying in ambush below. They would tell stories, etched on their worldly wise faces, of old comrades who had lost their lives in such circumstances. The little sparrows would listen quietly, deeply believing that the stories were true, but the image of the rice grains, as alluring as a woman, would remain at the corner of their eyes. They would want to take a chance, hoping to be the lucky one to escape the terrible crisis. Of course, warning signs are never effective in the face of the sustenance of life. We use this net to lure those who risk their lives for survival.</p>
<p>Now, we sparrow-catching companions are ourselves hesitating in the invisible web of life. Some have already boldly stepped forward without regard for the consequences. Of course, we will never forget the sight of those little sparrows struggling in the net. When we moved to kill them, they would try to escape until their last breath while in our grasp. Seeing this cruel act, our companions would tremble and be unable to support their small bodies. Some would faint in the net before we could kill them. Now, the executioners are closing in on the trap of this net. Another type of executioner will never let us go either. So why not try to avoid this crisis? Can't we live outside the net? We have already erected these warning signs in front of everyone. We carefully avoid this web of life, hoping to be like the small sparrows on the roof, freely moving from this branch to that, or chasing each other in the open space. But the image of the rice grains, as alluring as a woman, remains at the corner of our eyes. Step by step, we approach this web of life. Unlike the small sparrows, we don't hope to be the lucky ones to escape the terrible crisis. We know that it is impossible to escape. Once we become a prisoner in this net, we are already on the execution ground. But we cannot endure the immediate coercion. The rice grains are pressuring us to be ruled by the net. In the grasp of this overwhelming authority, warning signs will never be effective!</p>
<h3 id="e242">My Wife in the Hospital <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yun</p>
<p>Thinking about my wife holding our newborn baby as she leaves the hospital, I secretly feel very happy. Because a family of just a husband and wife is indeed too lonely! Sometimes, when one side is in a bad mood or is affected by external stimuli, the two sides often quarrel over trivial matters. Moreover, my wife is a very competitive woman, and she often stubbornly refuses to compromise, causing her bright eyes to swell and turn as red as walnuts.</p>
<p>"Maybe having a child will be our buffer. At that time, the trivial and unreasonable quarrels between us will be reduced invisibly by the child's innocent laughter. Therefore, the family will become harmonious, I think." Whenever my wife and I argued, and we both felt a little remorseful, I would always say this to her, and she would nod silently in agreement.</p>
<p>Now that my wife is about to leave the hospital with our newborn baby, I secretly wish for a harmonious family: from now on, there will be no more unreasonable quarrels and disputes. But the hospital bill that I had to pay when my wife was about to be discharged made me feel very uneasy.</p>
<p>"Ren! The doctor already saw me this morning. He said that my fever has subsided, and if I don't have a fever again tonight, then I can be discharged..." My wife propped her back with a pillow and sat up halfway from the bed, with a smile on her lips. "I think it's okay to go out. It's not the best solution to lie here for recovery. At the same time, it can save some hospital money. Besides, you have to come here to accompany me every day, which takes up too much of your valuable time..."</p>
<p>"Uh, but... you still have to stay..." My throat felt as heavy as a lead block.</p>
<p>In fact, the doctor had already told me that my wife's fever had subsided and that she could be discharged. However, I had been running around this morning for money, and I had suffered a lot of anger and been rebuffed by many friends. They all seemed to know the purpose of my visit, and as soon as they saw me, they would first tell me how poor they were. But in order to make my wife feel at ease and not hurt her fragile heart, I had to swallow all this anger and not let it out. Although I also hoped that my wife could be discharged sooner, it was not possible to do so quickly due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>"What?... Ren! Do you still want me to spend more days of loneliness and quiet in the hospital?" My wife asked, her voice louder than before, clearly with some anger.</p>
<p>"No, why are you angry again?" I moved my seat closer and held her trembling hand tightly. "You have to rest well and recover completely. That's very important, especially for us who have fallen on hard times! Besides, the weather is getting colder day by day, and that attic is really too narrow and cold. We have to find a better place to live."</p>
<p>"I think I should go out sooner, because if I stay any longer, the money will definitely be used up too much. We should consider our strength," my wife said slowly, her tone as calm and weak as an old person. I guessed that she must have remembered the terrible days of past hardship.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of silence, I finally broke the silence and said.</p>
<p>"Nong! Just bear with it and stay a day or two more before being discharged."</p>
<p>Although children are innocent and lovely, the thought of my wife's hospital bill filled my heart with discomfort and pain!</p>

<p>First cry, second jump, third time, sit in jail. —Spinning factory folk song—</p>
<h3 id="e244">Uncle Chun <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— A Le</p>
<p>My neighbor, Uncle Chun, people call him a monster. Although he is nearly sixty years old and his hair is white, his spirit is still strong. If you like to talk to him, he won't show any sign of fatigue even for a whole day. However, he only does that for people he deems worthy. Sometimes, even when someone he deems worthy talks to him, he will sit silently or stand blankly, leaving you to talk to the sky alone.</p>
<p>Because he is such a person, naturally few people get along with him, especially since he is also an old man.</p>
<p>He often walks alone in the wilderness, lingering silently under an ancient pine tree. Only when the sun sets and the birds return to the forest does he slowly stroll home. In the evening, he must drink, and he must drink until he is drunk.</p>
<p>At this time, if you enter his only quiet room, you must sit there silently, waiting for him to speak first. Otherwise, he will rudely throw you out.</p>
<p>Once, just as he had returned from the wilderness one evening, I barged into his room and sat there silently, watching him drink.</p>
<p>He took a sip, put down his glass, paused for a moment, then picked it up again, his eyes wide as if lost in thought, staring at the table.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he jumped up, slapped the table, and angrily said:</p>
<p>[Damn it!]</p>
<p>But immediately, as if he had only realized someone was in his room after saying that, he returned to his normal state and said with a faint smile:</p>
<p>[Drinking?]</p>
<p>[No.] I replied.</p>
<p>[Not being able to drink is a big loss.]</p>
<p>[I don't think so.]</p>
<p>He continued to smile, sat down, picked up his glass, and continued to drink.</p>
<p>This time, for some reason, he spoke particularly little. In the past, he would undoubtedly have expounded his grand theories or cursed heaven and earth, pouring out all his grievances with the help of alcohol. But tonight, he was unusually calm. I also felt it was too boring, so I bid him farewell and left his home.</p>
<p>A few days later, when I returned home from school, my younger brother told me, seemingly urgently:</p>
<p>[Uncle Chun is dead.]</p>
<p>I was stunned in surprise for a long while. My younger brother continued with difficulty:</p>
<p>[The day before yesterday afternoon, someone saw him sitting under that pine tree he used to like to sit under, sometimes wailing and sometimes laughing loudly. People were used to his behavior, so no one paid attention to him. Who would have thought he would die there! It is said that his corpse was still embracing that broken pine tree and wouldn't let go.]</p>
<p>Uncle Chun is dead. The reason why Uncle Chun hugged that pine tree before his death is still a mystery to this day.</p>

<h3 id="e245">An Extremely Difficult Matter <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a clerk in a shop. Recently, I have encountered many contradictory phenomena that are making me very troubled. Therefore, I am sacrificing one hour of precious sleep time to write this letter to you, hoping you can give me some guidance.</p>
<p>In this era of strong neighbors bullying us, most people are trying to resist and working hard for the country, resisting enemy goods, and so on. However, our manager is scheming to smuggle in enemy goods in order to make a huge profit. At the same time, if a competitor has already imported a certain enemy good that he doesn't have, he becomes very anxious, fearing that he will not be able to compete with them for profit. Even if someone calls him a traitorous merchant, he always smiles and says, [Yes, to be a merchant is to be a traitor]. In terms of conscience, with national disaster looming, one should not work for the enemy. But according to the facts, an old businessman naturally has to find ways to make profits in order to survive. I am now a clerk. [I receive my salary here, and I should be loyal here], but loyalty to the shop also goes against my conscience. How should I cope with this contradictory environment? I hope you can give me an answer. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Qun Sheng</p>
<p>Editor's note: In this era, everything is full of contradictory phenomena. Thus, young people generally feel very painful due to the surrounding contradictions and the blows from reality. The contradictory life that Mr. Qun Sheng described can be said to be representative of a portion of people.</p>
<p>However, the editor believes that if we can recognize the essence of contradiction, this phenomenon can instead increase our understanding of current affairs, increase our grief and anger, and increase our determination and courage to actively prepare to break the contradictions. This is overcoming contradiction, rather than being overcome by it. If you suffer from the pain of contradictory phenomena, but you don't know how to recognize it and overcome it, you will only be surrounded by pain all day long, unable to escape. You will become a prisoner of the environment, never able to free yourself!</p>
<p>The fact that most merchants have no national concept and smuggle in enemy goods for profit during this period of deepening national crisis is a reflection of the entire political system not being on the right track and the national spirit not being invigorated. Regarding this matter, from a small perspective, one can choose opportunities to use legitimate means to restrain these traitorous merchants at any time. But from a larger perspective, one should pay attention to the direction of the entire political and diplomatic situation and engage in the preparation of the entire nation in order to eliminate this bad phenomenon. Indignation, grief, and passive complacency are of no help to the facts.</p>
<p>Based on this idea, the editor believes that Mr. Qun Sheng can temporarily endure and continue to work, waiting for future opportunities. As long as he does not directly purchase and transport enemy goods, he has a clear conscience. Otherwise, he can only seek other developments; however, before finding another job, he does not need to feel too sad and angry, because we have already said that sadness and anger alone cannot compensate for the facts!</p>

<p>— Yang Yang</p>
<p>It's almost unbelievable that a woman who uses sex appeal on stage or screen to attract audiences has many aspects of her private life that even old-fashioned housewives can't fully achieve. But that is an undeniable fact. She often says to people: [When it comes to my private life, I am not afraid to compare it with any woman's private life.] She has been in Hollywood for three years, but a group of nosy, gossipy reporters have yet to find anything objectionable about her. If you still don't believe she is one of Hollywood's most forward-thinking puritans, we can examine many of the sins of 1934 one by one to see which sin can be pinned on Mae West. Some say that stealing someone else's husband is this year's most hateful sin. But Mae West doesn't even look at other people's husbands. She has said: [Other women's men, whether they are husbands, fiancés, or boyfriends, I will never compete with others for them. Of course, men who have already divorced their wives are included in this. Although love is similar to war, and all is fair in war, there is intense competition in love, but you must remember that there are plenty of single men in the world for you to choose from, so why steal someone else's property?]</p>
<p>Or spreading rumors is now the second biggest sin. Even first-class stars cannot avoid whispering about the secrets of their rival stars with friends. But Mae West is most opposed to interfering in other people's privacy. She treats people fairly and is especially loyal to all her old friends. She herself has said: [Whoever wants to tell me bad things about my friends, I will definitely not believe them. Conversely, I will never say bad things about others to others. I know from my personal experience that that is the most unfair thing. Since I came to Hollywood, I don't know how many bad things have been published in the newspapers. They are all baseless. The first thing is that they always say I have a husband. I have protested so much that I don't want to protest anymore.] Therefore, she hates those who spread rumors the most, and when she sees friends whispering and acting suspiciously, she always walks away and has never participated in it once.</p>
<p>Snobbery and fickleness are also common problems among many stars. They avoid their old friends who were very close to them before they became famous, or who contributed to them, or who helped them, after they become rich. Mae West is not that kind of snob. Many actors who were famous on stage or screen but later failed are still constantly being helped by her. One of them, a once very famous singer, is still being provided with living expenses by Mae and lives in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Other minor sins, such as hypocrisy and pretense, are especially difficult for ordinary stars to avoid. But Mae, some say, she may be the most honest woman in Hollywood. Her own way of observing this matter is: [I do a beautiful thing, a smart thing, not because that thing is beautiful or smart. I follow what my heart likes and seek what my heart finds peace in. Conversely, many people think that beautiful things should be done, but I refuse to do them because my nature is not close to them. For example, opera, I have never liked to watch it. If someone sincerely likes to watch opera, that's another matter, but among the people who go to watch opera, some of them don't really like it, but want to show their faces in the opera house and let people see them and think they are beautiful. As far as I am concerned, I like to watch boxing, I don't care what people say, I will go to see it if I want to.] Similarly, Mae refuses to participate in all unnecessary social events, regardless of whether they affect her career. She has never [used political tactics]. She has never used strikes to threaten to get a raise. She doesn't think rebellion is something she does. She also has no laziness, which is the greatest sin. Whenever she is not working on the set, her time is spent on writing. She writes novels, plays, and songs. She also practices singing every day. She never goes to nightclubs to play and does not do boring things to kill time. Finally, her courage is admirable. After her jewelry was stolen, she received many threatening letters, telling her not to report it, otherwise her life would be in danger. But she eventually reported it and personally testified in court. So the judge also said: [If everyone were as brave and decisive as Mae West, half of the evils in the world could be reduced.

<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e251">Review of [The Barretts of Wimpole Street] <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Barretts of Wimpole Street — Nanjing</p>
<p>Naturally, a film like this is very worthy of praise. At the very least, we can glimpse the high level of development of American cinematic art.</p>
<p>To have a deeper understanding of this film, we cannot ignore the dynamics of society during the Victorian era. After the Industrial Revolution, the early capitalist ideology began to contend with established forces, which is an explanation of historical significance. Regarding the poet couple Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett, during their youth, they suffered the cruel poison of feudal forces. They consciously became rebels against feudalism, and at the same time, they saw to some extent the painful cries of the laborers. In particular, from [The Cry of the Children], we can know that Elizabeth was indeed a timid awakener. Of course, to be precise, in that era, they were not yet advanced poets, but they were not lagging behind either.</p>
<p>From this perspective, we see the playwright writing Elizabeth as a timid woman who opposes feudalism, escaping from the violence of her family (her father) and longing for freedom with Browning. In any case, it touches reality. Here we see Sidney Franklin, in addition to positive depictions, also used symbolic techniques. For example, Barrett (i.e., Elizabeth's father) repeatedly closes the windows, darkening the room. He imprisons his daughter. Elizabeth struggles to run to the window, smiling at the winter sun. Furthermore, after her joyful meeting with Browning, we see how he positively describes the strong and cruel feudal forces, and how he depicts the ferocity of that domestic tyrant: When Barrett enters the door, a puppy immediately flees to its original place. The third daughter, Henrietta, and her lover meet secretly in the snow, looking so pitiful. When Barrett discovers that his third daughter is in love, he brutally threatens her not to associate with that officer again. When Barrett forces Elizabeth to leave Browning and return to her room, the director uses a bird's-eye view.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, we might as well look at his depiction of the passionate love of young poets. Isn't it so? A young girl needs love after all, and the chains of family cannot bind the passionate love of a young girl. Like what Browning said, [I love you, I can never leave you], Elizabeth and Browning being engaged, her chronic illness suddenly healed, she said: [I cannot die, I do not want to die]. She began to be active in life, for the glory of love. This is a great contrast to her seeing the dim moonlight and the dripping rain outside the window and crying desperately. Similarly, the third daughter, Henrietta, also has the determination to sacrifice for love. Here we can see that the author has emphasized the part of love very much. Regarding this part, the excellent scenes include Browning entering the bedroom and Elizabeth tidying up the bedding in great surprise, and the tenderness of the joyful conversation in the park, all of which are very good depictions.</p>
<p>However, in our demand for realism, does this film very accurately depict the reality of the time in cinematic art? We feel it is still quite insufficient. If the playwright was a courageous realist, he would have focused heavily on the clash of new and old ideas, bravely demonstrating the glory of opposing feudalism. However, it has intensified the depiction of Barrett's perverted personality. He made Barrett forbid his daughter from marrying entirely because of his hatred of love due to his own wife's elopement. At the same time, he added a desire beyond father-daughter love between the father and daughter. As a result, the reason why the father opposed his daughter's marriage was not emphasizing the conflict between new and old ideologies.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not say that there are no such fathers in the world, but this is not the most prominent representative of the general, that is, it is definitely not a typical depiction. Therefore, due to the emphasis on this aspect, it weakens the positive depiction of opposing feudalism, which is inevitably a pity; although I will not ignore the fact that the feudal Barrett borrowed the power of religion to extremely oppress his children, causing their positive reaction.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the highest level of development of film art in the United States is unfolded here, which is a kind of amazing brilliance. This is of course because the director Franklin's technique is too good, and every actor can express himself as he wishes, not to mention the beauty of the photography. Strictly speaking, I think Maureen O'Sullivan, who plays the third daughter, is above Fredric March in acting.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Review of [The Dragon Pool Key] <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>First of all, because we have recently been shown several detective films in succession, and most of them are mediocre and vulgar, simply boring detective films, we must specifically say a few words about this type of film.</p>
<p>Originally, because the detective story itself is full of drama, under a more serious attitude and clever techniques, it is possible to construct extremely perfect and meaningful works. The so-called meaning here should be placed on the intellectual education of thinking scientifically about unusual events and seeking solutions.</p>
<p>But what kind of detective films have we seen recently? From [Corpse in the Empty Building], [San Francisco Trunk Murder Case], and [Corpse in the Foggy Night], to this [Dragon Pool Key], whether in terms of results or significance, the distance from what we hope for in detective films and the level that detective films should and can achieve is too far. Originally, in the hands of filmmakers who regard movies as one of the pastimes for the well-fed and well-clothed, and who do not need any art other than [business]—even if they do, they only need to make the pastime better and more enjoyable—the vulgarity of film works is of course not expressed solely in the area of detective films. Isn't it so? Forcibly arranging a case, forcibly coming up with a solution, and then forcefully inserting a love component between men and women, in order to alleviate the dull atmosphere after death, injury, and robbery, isn't it enough for the leisurely to pass two hours?</p>
<p>Speaking of [The Dragon Pool Key] itself, it is not much different from the detective films that were shown before it. It's just that the former used indoor mechanisms, boxes, cars, airplanes, etc. as the key to the story, but this [Dragon Pool Key] has replaced it with a gloomy ancient pool as the main background of the script, in order to use the actors' swimming skills and strong bodies to give some viewers a little satisfaction. As for using a key as a tool for solving the case, it is no different from other films using something else.</p>
<p>Detective films are originally known for their particularity, bizarre events, tortuous process, and rigorous structure. This film also narrates the events that are enough to develop into a murder case due to money, love, etc., but in the plot, we do not see at all that the murderer has the necessity to kill. The necessary twists, tension, and changes are not fully present here either.</p>
<p>Detective star Warren William in this film, just as the content of the film determines him, does not have the ability to express the unique characteristics of a great detective. The rest of the actors are just average, and they are considered competent for such a script.</p>

<p>[Madness] is Xu Liang's attempt at a new movie. It is a tragedy similar to [Goodbye, Shanghai!].</p>
<p>The rumor that Wang Tianbei has left Happy Woods is absolutely untrue. Wang is planning to continue his efforts in Happy Woods, or will direct a sound film.</p>
<p>Happy Woods' sound production is in active progress.</p>

<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>Since that stormy day, not many years have passed, and Beatrice has become famous throughout the country, known as the Pancake Queen of America, and Delilah's face, printed on every bag of pancake flour, has become the high standard of a great business. Delilah herself is very detached from money. Except for the future of Peola, and her own affairs after death, she almost doesn't know what money is for. She only seeks to serve her beloved Miss Pei. She insists on cooking three meals a day for herself and Miss Pei. Pei understands her loyalty and had already deposited a sum of money in the bank under Delilah's name. That sum of money is already enough to make Delilah economically independent and have more than enough, as long as she wants to enjoy that kind of independence herself. Of course, Pei also did not forget that great contributor, Elmer Smith. ... Time flies, and suddenly recalls the tenth anniversary of the occurrence of Delilah pancake flour. Pei specially held a banquet in the Sutton house. Elmer was the chairman of the bar that day. Pei was surrounded by men who envied her. She was wearing a gorgeous evening dress, truly radiant, making her figure even more slender and her skin more delicate. After a while, Beatrice escaped the men surrounding her and ran to the balcony to get some air. She wanted to be alone for a while. The place where she stood was directly opposite the front door. She saw a person pacing back and forth outside the door, as if looking for something. He suddenly looked up and saw Pei's shadow. He stared for a while, then suddenly smiled and asked; [It's funny, how can't I find the doorbell. Do you know, where did that thing go?] As he was talking, the gate suddenly opened, and a guest walked out, brushing shoulders with him as he went down. The person who wanted to come in nodded to Pei with a smile and said: [Okay, okay, I can come in.] Pei felt very strange, she walked down and asked the doorman who the stranger was, but the doorman didn't know either. She wanted to avoid him, he seemed to be coming in to find someone. But as soon as she turned her head, the first guest was already standing in front of her. She treated him as if he were an old friend, and greeted her unceremoniously: [Hello... I'm in.] Pei was stunned by his greeting. She stammered: [Oh, you're in.] The man said again: [It's very strange, where is that doorbell, do you know? I'm afraid that doorbell must be inlaid with gold and copper, so the owner hides it in the safe at night. One day, I'll come during the day to see what the doorbell looks like.] Pei couldn't help but laugh when she heard him say this. This person, she felt, had a special flavor... almost like... champagne. So they started talking like old acquaintances. When the music started, the two of them felt extremely natural to hug and dance. Pei only found out his name was Stephen Archer while dancing with him. He was Elmer's friend, and Elmer asked him to meet Beatrice today. After one dance, Stephen went to get ice water for Pei. At this time, Elmer had found him. Elmer followed behind Stephen, as if arguing with him about something. Only Stephen was heard saying: [I told you I don't have time to meet her, Elmer. I'm busy now.] At this time, the two of them had already walked in front of Beatrice. Elmer grabbed Stephen and said: [Haha she's here... you come and see her, whether you want to or not] Stephen looked up at Beatrice's face, unable to speak for a long time. Suddenly he laughed wildly: [Oh... oh... oh... oh... so you are...] Pei couldn't wait to finish speaking, and continued: [Pancake flour king.] As she said this, she laughed out loud too. Elmer looked at Pei, then at Stephen, and then asked: [What? Did you know each other before?] But Pei didn't say anything, and pushed him away. (To be continued)</p>
