<h3>羅傑士來華與白銀問題　英</h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯福氏派遣來華專任調查遠東巿塲與白銀狀况之羅傑士氏、已於日昨抵滬入京、訪我朝野要人、據報紙傳述其任務、純屬諮詢性質、不</p>
<p>作任何談判、現雖無以證實、然大致似亦不過如是、惟吾人以白銀問題、爲與我國國民經濟有非常密切之關係當此代表華盛頓政府之專使爲此問題遠涉重洋翩然降止之日、吾人不能無一言以貢獻羅氏、并藉以說明吾國人所當努力之途徑焉、</p>
<p>吾人推想羅氏來華之目的意殆在如何發展美國之商務、而於白銀問題之尋求解决、則不過爲其推廣商務方法之一端、而與吾國對於白銀問題所具有之意義、似未可相提並論、試觀美國自去年四月放棄金本位而後、降低美元、囤集黃金、凡其當局所听夕以謀者、無非欲以低廉之匯價、換取海外巿塲之擴張、故與英日諸工業輸出國家之暗鬥、至爲激烈、是卽世人所謂英美日之匯兌戰爭、美國在此基本政策之下、欲推行入於遠東方面之一般用銀國家、使美元對於用銀國家之匯兌、亦有同樣之低落、則美國在遠東商務、卽有擴張之可能、此就美國方面而言、無論白銀派與非白銀派、同具此種基本觀念、固爲人所共知者也、此種觀念、經白銀派之竭力鼓吹、故於去年有倫敦白銀恊定之參訂、近則有各種白銀法案之提議、主旨所在、乃益顯露今羅氏承美政府之命、來華調查、雖未必出自白銀派之主張、然其不能超出美國國家利益之立塲、以爲白銀問題說法、則可斷言者也、</p>
<p>羅氏之使命、果如上言、祇在於如何擴張其本國之商務者、則羅氏今日、須先有一種深切之認識、卽吾國人民對於美國貨物購買力之强弱如何是也、國家購買力之强弱决不隨銀價之變化而有多大之起伏、銀價之低落、固未必足以阻止美國貨物之流入、銀價之高昻、尤未必能助長美國貨物之暢銷、此固吾人徵諸歷年海關統計、而歷歷可以證明者、今美國果欲開拓其巿塲、</p>
<p>而增高吾人之購買力、其道惟在於如何使吾人出口貨物之價値與數量、能日增月進、然後交易始可密切、更在於如何使吾國能入於獨立自由之建設、然後生產可以擴張、巿場可以發達、此則吾人願羅氏能同具此觀念之所在也、若徒知依違取捨於銀價之貴賤、如美國白銀派之所爲、是尙非根本之論、而去增進國際商務關係之道、抑亦遠矣、</p>

<p>華盛頓政府當局今日表示如不能早日將核减戰債一事解决、則勢必影響及於互惠商約之談判、國會仍堅决反對核减戰債、而據歐洲各國之報告稱、對於建議中之商約、現漸失去其熱忱、根據國會現欲討論之關稅案、則羅斯福總統有權締結上項商約、據今日官塲公佈以總統要求磋商關稅之權力、實爲抗拒國家主義怒潮之要舉、且此舉之於美國「孤獨政策」與「廣闊的關稅政策」二者間之一種折衷辦法、若照羅斯福機密顧問之意見、則「廣闊的關稅政策」爲經濟生存之第二方法也、以國際而論、則該舉爲對於在倫敦會議時美國似欲採擇之一種極端的國家主義之絶决表示、在倫敦會議時、美國固拒絶國際合作之穏定與聯合步驟也、農長蕭萊斯關於此節、曾對公衆鄭重表示、美國必須作最後之决定、以顯明其究竟趨向國家主義或國際主義也、如採擇國家主義之途、則美國必須放棄增闢中之一００·０００·０００英畝種植地、因無一國外巿塲有容消如此巨額之農產也、故結果則三分之一之種植地、仍遭荒廢、而農民亦將發生巨額之流徙、農業旣最易感受出口貿易之影響故將因此計劃而受犧牲、且外國欠美戰債之利息、年約一·０００·０００·０００金元、各國旣欲償付之、安有國外貿易之可言、故第二辦法、惟有减少關稅之障碍、使各國能購農產及以貨物付債云云、據華氏估計、此舉將牽涉使美國每年接受外國之貨價、值美金一·０００·０００·０００元云、（十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>日僞在東北組織棉花公司</h3>
<p>抵制外棉輸入東北</p>
<p>獨佔我國棉花巿塲</p>
<p>長春通訊、日本爲抵制外棉輸入東北、以及獨佔我國棉紗巿塲起見、近又唆使僞組織設立滿洲棉花股份有限公司、由僞實部作成法令、於上月二十六日提出僞國務會議通過、現已正式成立總公司於遼寗、復在各重要地帶設立分公司、積極設法改良種籽及培植方法、並盡力宣傳種棉之利益、期在十年內較原產之三千萬斤、可以增加至八千萬斤之多、該公司並宣稱、如果在第一年度栽培指導得宜、則十年後可以超過預定之生產額、茲特將其組織該公司之用意、及組織方法披露如下、</p>
<p>抵制外棉輸入東北</p>
<p>東北所產棉花、因種子之不良、及栽植方法純屬舊式、以致發生求過於供之現象、而日本所產之棉花、亦無過剩、勢需仰仗外棉輸入、以資調劑、此項漏巵、爲數極鉅日人有鑒於此、故有此公司之設立、此後外棉之輸入東北、勢必受絶大之打擊、</p>
<p>獨佔我國棉紗巿塲</p>
<p>日本利用我國關稅不能自主、便於運華推銷、以壟斷我國之巿塲、並遍設紗廠於我國內地各重要都巿、以摧殘我國之紗廠、使之頻於破產、近復變本加厲、冀以東北將來所產之棉花、盡力向內地輸運、以東北之原料、供日人之製造、然後則向我巿塲傾銷、而關稅更可避免、其用意之深、手段之辣、莫過於此矣、設立機關收買棉花</p>
<p>該公司除指導人民種植棉花、以及改良棉花種籽外、並在各產棉地帶設置收買所堆棧、以一定之價格、隨時派員收買棉花、窺其用意、不外使農民終年之收獲、不致剩餘、因之增加農民種植棉花之興趣、</p>

<p>棉花公司之組織法</p>
<p>該公司之組織法、共計二十九條、茲擇其重要者列下、㈠政府爲謀改良增殖國內出產棉花起見、而設立滿洲棉花股份有限公司、在實業部長指定區城內、實行收買其所出產棉花、㈡滿洲棉花股份有限公司、以經營收買及採種國內出產棉花爲目有、㈢總店設於奉天、得實業部長認可、得必要地設置收買處、㈣資本爲二百萬元、其中政府出一百萬元、㈤股票爲記名式、每股五十元、㈥滿洲棉花股份有限公司之存在、以設立登記日起、至二十年爲止、滿期後得政府之許可、得延長之、㈦滿洲棉花股份有限公司、設董事長一人、董事四人、監督二人、㈧董事長董事監督等俱在股東會中選出、但未得政府之許可、不能就任、董事長董事任期爲四年、監督人爲二年、㈨本公司對政府所有之股份外、其他股份可按年分配六分之利息、惟政府所有之股份、不分配利息、㈩政府對本公司每年分配給其他、股份之六分利息、每年應發給十萬元補助金予本公司、查其上述條欵、所有股本規定由僞政府出其半數、其餘則招商股、表面視之、固屬官商合辦之尋常事業、但在實際方面、僞政府完全受日人之統治、而實權仍操諸日人、此種公司之組織、不過一種新的侵略方式、用以欺騙東北民衆之花眼法耳、</p>

<h3>中航機失蹤後往尋飛機又告擱淺　十六號機勢將絶望　今日將派大隊人員　開往舟山羣島遍索</h3>
<p>申時社云、中航公司十六號塞可斯機失蹤後、前晨在西沙島過夜之十七號機、於昨晨亦突告失蹤、至下午五時半始尋獲、係因潮去、擱淺於浙屬之鎭海口、全部機身不以轉動、須俟潮漲後方能飛起、至十六號機、復經昨日續派兩機、及霍克駕機、努力尋索、結果、仍無下落、希望已極微細、據專家推測、該機失事地點、必在舟山羣島之間、中航公司决定於今日、由水路運大隊人員、前赴該島、凖備盡一日內、將該處大小島嶼、加以詳細搜索、冀獲最後之希望、申時社記者特將各情誌次十七號機又告失蹤</p>
<p>十六號塞可斯機失蹤後、前日奉命出發索尋之十七號機塞可斯機、因當日不及趕回、當晚曾電告在西沙島附近過夜、俾次日再繼續偵查、詎該機自昨晨至中午後、又無絲毫信息、公司各方面、更感焦急、當於下午、卽急電致昨晨出發由愛連生等所架之洛寗機、令其先察尋十七號機所在、至下午三時、仍未見二機</p>
<p>之踪影、直至下午五時、始在遠離西沙島之鎭海洋面發見、因該機被氣候所迫、降落水面、適遇潮退、致在沙漢擱淺、機身不能轉動、無綫電亦失效能、但尙無十分損傷、該機內計載機師格羅樞·西勒·華達·三人、及公司之稽核員李君等四人、該機須於今晨潮來時、始可安全飛起、</p>
<p>十六號機將告絶望</p>
<p>至三日前失蹤之十六號機、昨日仍由海陸空三路尋索、同時美航空大佐霍克氏、亦於昨日下午二時、駕駛大號康道機出發、帮同沿海搜尋、各方勉力追索結果、僅發現昨晨失蹤之十七號機、而十六號機、始終仍無下落、至昨下午六時止、陸路追尋人員、及洛寗機、均不得結果而返、至惠德豐拖駁及聶開一等、仍在繼續沿海覓尋、據一般推測、該機經三日餘之搜索、仍無結果、希望已漸趨微薄、</p>
<p>但公司負責人、及隨機失蹤者之家屬、仍於絶望中、期待最後之希望、</p>
<p>特派大隊遍索羣島</p>
<p>昨日下午七時後、各方搜索無結果時、公司負責人復召請專家等、精心推考結果、認爲該失事地點、决在舟山</p>
<p>羣島附近、故公司等各方面、昨晚决定、萬一該機已告失事、亦務必將機骸死傷人員等獲而後已、故决於今日開始、除續派機偵索該機外、並將招僱大批人員、由輪運赴各該島、分别上陸、詳細搜索、蓋</p>
<p>該羣島最大面積、直行僅十五英里、費一二日時間、卽可將該島搜遍、無論生死存亡、冀可獲得相當結果、</p>
<p>失蹤原因另一推測</p>
<p>經連日探找無着後、昨據某方面推測、認爲該機失蹤、業經三日、經詳盡週到之搜覓、如係航行失事、多少必有所獲、此次該機失蹤、或尙有其他可疑原因、亦未可知、</p>
<p>滬粤航綫暫時停班</p>
<p>昨據中航公司消息、現開航滬粤綫之塞可斯機一架、旣告失蹤、十七號機又經擱淺、故今日之滬粤班期、勢不得不暫行停止、俟該失蹤機有着落後、再行開航、至其他之滬平·滬漢·及漢榆·各綫、仍照規定班次、照常飛行、</p>
<p>蓬勃、關於新生活運動的意義、簡單說、是要人人能夠「明禮義」、「知廉恥」、使日常生活能夠「整齊」·「清潔」·「簡單」·「樸素」·詳細的理論和辦法、本會請有名人演說、所以不再贅述、這新生活是蔣委員長所發起、希望上行下效、各位在今天參加後、回去能照新生活公約實行、才不負舉行這個會的重大意義、</p>
<p>代表演詞　陸京士演辭、略謂今日開會、男女同胞到會者不少、可謂盛大、舉行這個會的意義、是要使各位明瞭人民生活所需要的衣食住行、能夠趨循正軌、因爲中國人的習慣太自由了、就忘記了禮義廉恥、根本談不到整齊清潔簡單樸素了、各位須知道國勢的盛衰和民族精神、大有關係、像中國一般人、隨便什麽馬馬虎虎、這是很不好的現象、所以新生活運動、是中國社會目前所急切需要的一種運動、這運動的目的、是校正隨便的習慣、使合於現代的生存以達復興民族的目的、並有程寬正·林美衍·及各代表演說、大都闡揚新生活運動意義、語多精警、</p>
<p>宣讀公約　末由主席唐贊之逐條朗誦公約、聽者動容、宣讀畢、攝影、分送農展會贈品、有天廚味精廠之味精、家庭工業社牙粉、及吳淞各界所贈之豆餅農具什用品等二千餘件、散會時、已萬家燈火矣、吳淞區新生活運動促進會、定明日起至十五日舉行提燈大會、並於十五日下午舉行風箏比賽、</p>

<p>行禮如儀後、主席童行白報告、略謂、「今天舉行第七週年清黨紀念會、七年前、本黨發動清黨、因爲那時本黨容共、而共黨中途變態、故有清除共黨之舉、當時共黨以黨員加入本黨、寄生在本黨之下、利用本黨力量、以本黨作傀儡、用手腕來向黨政軍各方面操縱、本黨在未北代時、因在粤地區狹小、故能把持、及至出師北代、本黨多數人才、均向外發展、共黨見此情形、必能利用、遂以種種手叚、破壞革命軍進展、因此北伐受重大打擊、當時統軍者卽蔣委員長、覺處處受共黨牽掣、痛苦非常、遂有謀江浙兩省爲根據地、實行聯合忠實同志、清除共黨之舉、此時共黨雖有潛勢力、但終不能離本黨而獨立、故一經清黨後、共黨卽消滅、其時本黨同志有贊成反對兩種主張、一說總理旣容共在前、清共不免違反總理意旨、一說以前總理容共、是希望共黨帮助本黨革命、今共黨阻碍本黨革命、當然應加清除、其實總理容共之目的、在完成革命、後共黨破壞革命應有此種清黨之舉、故容共與清共、均爲完成革命、是本黨一貫政策、今吾人對清黨紀念、有兩種意義、㈠是復興本黨、因那時本黨名存實亡、共黨以國民黨爲招牌、處處做共黨工作、如當時不加清除、本黨已無存在餘地、㈡是復興民族、因共黨擬將中國獻與第三國際、爲俄國之續幸那時本黨臨危不二、由蔣委員長聯合諸同志實行清共、才有今日之民國」、（下略）</p>

<p>淞滬警備司令部巿保安處等軍警機關、以昨爲清黨紀念、深恐不肖之徒、勾結反動、擾亂治安、故令飭巿公安局曁所屬軍警機關、在交通要道、並在華租交界之處、一律雙崗、男女檢查員及偵緝人員、一律出巡、並檢查可疑行人、英法租界、亦由政治部派探梭巡要道、</p>

<h3>銀行界管理纱廠說榮林均謂不確</h3>
<p>昨日、報載華商紗廠以營業不振、向銀行界所舉借欵一萬二千萬元、無力償還、有將多數紗廠移歸銀行界管理之說、而日人方面、亦圖活動、擬向銀行界接洽執管云云、新聲社記者、以紗廠業爲我國最大之實業、如果屬實、影響社會非淺、特往訪紗業界及銀行界領袖、據其負責表示、知係完全不確、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>榮宗敬談話</p>
<p>據紗廠業領袖榮宗敬　向往訪之新聲社記者談、報載華商紗廠移轉於銀行界之說、全與事實不符、况本巿不需要如此鉅額借欵、紗廠業與銀行業往來、事實係屬必需、據說借欵數一萬二千萬之鉅以理想上本巿銀行業决無如此鉅大欵項、貸與紗廠業、因華商銀行、全部資產、除凖備金外、無此餘欵、故此昨日所載、全屬捕風捉影、顯係奸人另有作用、破壞紗廠業整個信用、再而影響社會、摧殘實業、甚堪痛心云云、</p>
<p>林康侯談話</p>
<p>據銀行業同業公會秘書長林康侯談、報載華商紗廠業已虧蝕半數以上、故向銀行界所舉之債、無示償還、將管理權移轉於銀行界之說、全屬子虛、因照公司法、凡股本虧蝕半數以上、根本已不能成立、至紗廠業如永安·申新·等經濟實力、向來充足、故所傳不足置信、况受世界不景氣影響、而致生產力減低、並非紗廠業、其他各業、亦受同樣之感覺、非我國一國、歐美各國皆然、至移轉管理之說、銀行業斷無此舉、因各種管理、皆須專門人才也、至往來欵項、皆有貨物擔保、故銀行業與紗廠業、皆有連鎖關係、紗廠業貸欵得以流動其物質、銀行業得運用其資金、收得息金、雖小規模之紗廠、有停業倒閉之舉、而大規模之紗廠、有連帶義務、况信用素來穏固、故是舉完全不確云、紗聯會表示</p>
<p>又據華商紗廠聯合會表示、報載所傳時、</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>未知何所根據、本會亦甚感詫異、此種捕風捉影之談、係屬奸人别有用意、有識者必不爲其所愚、故斯舉本會亦無聲明之必要云云、</p>

<p>邀、組織實業考察團赴魯考察歸來後、卽擬續往西南諸省考察、昨據錢承緒君向實業社記者談記團最近進行情形及擴充西南國貨巿面之計劃、茲分誌如下、</p>
<p>考察西南</p>
<p>該團前爲與西南諸省當局接洽考察事宜、並調查各地國貨產銷狀况、以作擴充西南國貨巿塲之凖備業經推派團員鄭益之先行赴港、轉往兩粤·滇·黔·諸省訪問、該團昨已接鄭君自廣州來電謂本月十五日卽將赴桂省梧州等地、並囑爲考察凖備　該團現已决定於下月初旬出發、團員中郭順·胡西園·吳蘊初·等均往參加前往、</p>
<p>推銷困難</p>
<p>惟對擴充西南國貨巿塲、障礙甚多、其最大困難、計有三點、㈠金融呆滯、匯水率太高、如雲南·貴州·等處、第匯百元至滬、滙水須四五十元之鉅、因</p>
<p>此滬地貨價、亦不得不提高、以維成本、㈡交通閉塞、運輸不便、水脚頗爲不貲、且雲南貨物、進口必須過安南海防、受制於外人之手、而廣西等地、商人欲採辦貨特、亦須經廣州商人之轉乎、重重盤剥、㈢西南各省、地處邊疆、外貨深得地域上之便利、致充斥巿塲、國貨欲長途遠征、决非一朝一夕所能得到勝利、綜上數點、均爲國貨銷路之妨害、</p>
<p>組織公司</p>
<p>團觀於以上種種困難、决組織大規模之公司、資本額已定爲二百萬元、所擬計劃、將先從兩地貨物交換入手、並使之價値平衡、任何一方、不得相差過甚、俾不致受匯水上之損失、現已從事調查滬地所需西南諸省之產物數量、鄭益之在粤亦經詳細調查　該省所需滬地之貨物、不日是將有報告到滬、該團擬俟考察歸來、卽行着手組織俾早日成立、</p>

<h3>研究國際問題的又一舉例㈢</h3>
<p>所以在英美日最近的國際關係上，確可找出他們忽然「言歸於好」的根據，這確不是「聰明的國際問題評論家的不肯認輸，巧妙的弄舌啊！」</p>
<p>然而，如果只做了這樣一番考察，到底是不夠的，我們還嫌這太空洞，有點像背誦公式似的，過於原則的了。</p>
<p>我們還應更進一步的將以上三國的關係如何反映在中國的形勢，拏來一看。在這裏，我們看出有兩組的路線的鬥爭，一是維持「門戶開放」「機會均等的原則的；一是主張瓜分中國的。現在國際形勢促成了後一路線的勝利，使美國不得不改變「九國公約」締結時的强硬態度，轉而謀美國利益新的轉向。瓜分中國成爲了當前一致的要求，大家都想把經濟恐慌中的損失</p>
<p>轉稼到中國去，卽由向瓜分半殖民地，暫時和緩經濟恐慌，勉强維持資本主義的殘喘的方向走去，自然，美國放棄自己的路線，是一種矛盾，便這矛盾是當前客觀形勢促成的，這一矛盾因這一形勢的改變，雖然並未消滅，却是轉入了另一形勢，造成了新的更大矛盾。我們應將道一要素加入到上面的分析裏去。</p>
<p>同時，打破經濟恐慌，和緩資本階級間戰爭</p>
<p>恐怖的另一出路，是大家聯合反蘇。日美妥恊不獨造成了反蘇戰爭的推進，同時，在這一名義下，實還可以遮蔽這一妥恊的反英的意義，幻映出帝國主義內部的一種新的團結，儼然帝國主義間眞的可望和恊似的。</p>
<p>這是這一問題發生的基礎。但是，我們對此妥恊作如何的估計呢？我們固應對它的發生有正確適宜的考察，但最應該注意的却不可忘了這妥恊是許多矛盾的綜合，它的發展隨着世界各列矛盾的推移而合改變它的方向的，就暫時說，我們對日美兩國的妥恊並不能像他們自己那樣樂觀，也不能卽認爲日美今日之結合，卽斷定將來世界大戰中日美一定站在一個壁壘內，卽由此形勢的發展，帝國主義的火併一定發現在英美兩主幹的比武，不出現於太平洋上美日的爭雄。也不能卽謂目前形勢發展下去，一定是反蘇戰爭，不會再走帝國主義相互火併的道路。固爲這些變動，完全要由其他的勢力變動，力量的對比的如何纔可决定，不能空洞的推測。此處我們祗能認定，這妥恊是造成更大的矛盾，前途必定是出於戰爭，不能有和平的樂觀。（未完）</p>

<h3>御香漂渺錄</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>不過，據我所知道，事實上伊對於廷臣所貢獻給伊的意見，却往往是非常的漠視；尤其是那些和伊自己的意見相左的話，那是更不願意聽了！這一次伊爲着要服從習慣，没法又下了一道例行公事式的上諭，可是這上諭下去之後，廷臣就不免大大的忙亂起來了，奏章像雪片似的送進來。他們的大意，都不外乎下面這幾名話··</p>
<p>「伏念中國自堯舜以來，歷朝帝主，未聞有輕以萬乘之尊，托諸于彼風馳電閃，險象環生之火車者；况我皇太后春秋已高，尤宜珍攝，以慰兆民之望。……卽朝中各事，亦端賴聖意裁决，不可一日廢弛。故臣等誠望我皇太后勿爲夷人之妖言所惑，罷東幸之行。實爲至善」！這裏所謂「夷人之妖言」，大概就是指我和我的妹妹而言。</p>
<p>在我們凖備起程的二十天之內，差不多每天總有這種奏章送進來，可是皇太后却一概置之不理，隨手撕成片片，丢滿了一地。這也是伊的習慣，每逢見到有什麽跟伊自己的意見相反的奏章，伊總是這樣撕掉的！伊還很着惱地說道··</p>
<p>「因爲從前的皇帝没有坐過火車，現在我們就不能坐嗎？要是那時候己有火車的話，他們怕不早就坐了！而且就是有什麽危險，我們也不怕！我們所經過的險事，還能說少嗎？尤其可惱的，這些奴才們竟敢說我是老了」！</p>

<h3>暹羅蜜橘</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>這幾天的暹羅蜜橘，佔了水果巿最大的地位，幾乎没一家水果店裏，不陳列着橘皮粗厚，橘色橙黃的暹羅蜜橘。</p>
<p>暹羅和我們的國交如何？暹羅對我們華僑的待遇如何？暹羅對將來的世界大勢如何？是否値得我們去替它推銷與消費蜜橘？這些問題太大了，我們也夠不上資格來七張八嘴。但在這國貨年中，國貨運動的聲浪，還保持着相當高度的時候，我們眼瞧着老爺，少爺，太太，奶奶，阿官，小姐口袋裏的銅子，角子，大洋錢，都慷而慨之去交給水果店老闆，再由水果店老闆去交給暹羅蜜橘的生產者。這麽幾個轉手的一種關係，若是細細咀嚼一下，怕比了暹羅蜜橘的滋味，有一些兒不可同日而語吧？　　其實，我們中國，在沿江沿海，幾乎没一省不產橘子的。廣橘，福橘，怎一點夠不上人家的？天台山蜜橘，比了暹羅蜜橘，更來得皮薄，汁多，而且味甘。四川，湖北，也產橘，不過不怎麽馳名。江西南豐產的無核小蜜橘，也是不很有人知道的，可就比了不拘怎一種橘都强。</p>
<p>在這提倡國貨的年頭兒，我以爲該由多方面同時並進，那才能收指臂之效。暹羅蜜橘，瞧着似乎是一個小問題，但是我們該多少要注意一下呀。</p>
<h3>裙帶和旗袍角</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>我們在各種報屁股上，往往可以見到文人，靠着鋒利的筆尖，譏諷人家的官職，仗着裙帶的關係而得到的。可是裙帶是婦女的特有特，現在已隨着時代的變遷，早已淘汰了。現代不論是摩登女子，或半老婦人，在都巿裏，很少見到穿裙的，穿裙的只有農村裏幾個老婆子了。</p>
<p>我們與其說裙帶，倒不如改說旗袍角來得切貼，來得合潮流些。的確現在的女子和婦人，都穿上了旗袍了，說旗袍角要比較摩登化了。</p>
<p>女人的權力也確實是不小，靠着走內綫而得到顯赫職位的，眞是不少。</p>
<p>老實說··「只要你把它的旗袍角拖得</p>
<p>牢，它到東，你也得到東，它到西，你也得到西，不然，你脫了手，你的職位也一定保不牢的。</p>
<p>眼看很有許多人，拖牢了它的旗袍角</p>
<p>，吃不盡，着不完，自己更得意洋洋的。講到它的本領，只有拖旗袍角是它的拿手。</p>
<h3>前樓阿姨傳</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>有了「後樓嫂嫂」，當然還有「前樓阿姨」，後樓嫂嫂叉叉麻將，摸摸紙牌，快樂逍遙！前樓阿姨，却居然之·乎·者·也，竟是一位不櫛進士！</p>
<p>前樓阿姨，不詳其姓氏，兒有呼以阿姨者，大家和之，因以爲號焉！</p>
<p>「閉門推出窗前月，投石衝開水底天」</p>
<p>伊能熟滔滔的，背出蘇小妹和秦少游的詩句，伊有時還出題給人屬對··這個題目很有趣！呌做「鴻字江邊鳥」人家却給伊怔住了屬對不出呢！</p>
<p>阿姨喜及皮絲烟和捲烟！吞雲吐霧，話匣開始！「孟昭先生，我們來談談東周列國志吧，什麽？「蘆中人·········腰纒寳劍七星文，不紀渡江時，麥飯飽魚</p>
<p>羹·········」說伍子胥歷歷如繪，我漫聲和之，敬以茶，烟，往往談到深更半夜，没有倦色，我的內人，也會聽出神來，說書塲裏，那會有這樣的才女呢？</p>
<p>我說前樓阿姨，眞是鐵中錚錚，爰爲之傳！</p>

<h3>自然化</h3>
<p>— 錢澐</p>
<p>外國人嚼甘蔗，形同吹簫，直綫的，中國人却像吹笛才乖咧，也寫意得多，嚼完隨口吐棄，極盡自然化，藝術化；例如阿三一根甘蔗，從三馬路吃到四馬路，也吐到四馬路，穿紅馬甲的掃街夫，最好隨後跟着！</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十七回　閨暗中消慈懷可感閒愁醉後起舊事難忘</p>
<p>到了屋子裏，自然，這首先讓自己所注意的，便是趙自强那些相從。眞的，他爺兒倆，全是忠厚人，决不會對人要什麽心眼。有道是人心換人心，對於這樣的丈夫和公公，不應該有什麽二心。他在屋子裏，對了相從發楞，可又聽到趙翁在外面呌道··小妹，快燒一壺水罷，給少奶奶沏菊花喝。桂枝，你自己不會點眼藥吧？請你們老太太給你來點上，你看怎麽樣？桂枝是根本没有眼病，如何要點眼藥，便答道··老爺子，我已經點上啦。趙翁道··有點辣嗎？過一會子就凉爽了。他說着話，還走到門簾子邊來。桂枝怕公公看出了形跡，立刻就伏在桌上，不敢抬起頭來。趙翁道··桂枝，你吃羊肝嗎？晚上買點羊肝來紗給你吃罷。那東西最亮眼晴的。桂枝道··佨不用費事，到了下午，我這病也就好了。趙翁道··你躺着罷，我要出去溜溜呢。桂枝伏在桌上，直聽到趙翁的脚步聲踏出了前院，他才敢抬頭來。心裏感到老人家這番週到就是自己父親還在，恐怕也不能這樣恩厚呢。他父子兩個，都是這樣的好心眼，說句迷信話，總不至於有什麽壞結果？看定了這一點，憑着良心，還是熬着罷。他這樣計畫以後，心裏便覺得坦然。那並不是因爲害病浮腫的眼晴，到了下午，也就好了。從這晚起，桂枝自己受着良心的裁判，已不再去胡思亂想，眼睛也不再會害了。不過他假病雖去，眞病却慢慢的來了。起初他是覺得有些身體疲倦，後來就心裏感到煩悶，只管要睡覺，再過一些時，又有些嘔吐。（三六一）</p>

<h3>硯的研究（廿）（一）</h3>
<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>澄泥硯概况</p>
<p>㈠澄泥硯的起原　據前人所記載，澄泥硯的原始，約有三說··一虢州澄泥硯，米史稱虢硯細紫可愛，發墨不滲，磨墨有泥香，唐人以爲第一，一澤州澄泥硯，歐譜稱澤州金道人澄泥硯，有呂字，堅緻可試墨，又米史稱澤陶硯，以别色泥作呂字，內外透；（呂卽呂道人）一爲絳州澄泥硯，蘇譜稱絳人囊泥汾水中，踰年，陶爲硯，水不涸。此三種的澄泥，究以何種爲先呢？則已不可考了。惟絳州的澄泥，尙能考究其製法，據文房四譜云··「山西絳縣人，善製澄泥硯，縫絹袋置於汾水中，踰年後，則泥已實囊矣。或以夾布囊盛墐泥，水中擺之，得細者澄去清水，令微乾，入黃丹，團摉如麵，入模中，壓令至堅，以竹刀刻硯狀，俟微乾，再用利刀削光，暴乾，厚以稻糠并黃牛糞，和入窰中，陶一伏時，然後入墨蠟，貯米醋蒸之，五七度，不亞於石。」製造澄泥硯方法之可考者如此，其後宋人嘗訪造之，硯箋引歐譜稱，造澄泥硯法，人罕知其妙，嚮時有著作佐郎劉義叟，如譜法造之，絶佳。余得其二，一贈劉原父，一置中書閣中，寳物也。今士大夫不學書，罕事筆硯，造硯之見於時者僅此耳。可見此種甄陶造成之佳硯，卽宋時仿製者，猶不可多得，况唐代之物乎？近來所見之澄泥硯甚多，大率粗礪傷筆，則皆元明以</p>
<p>後人所仿製者也。</p>
<p>㈡澄泥硯舊分三品　唐氏硯說云··陶　人以河海沙土配合入窰燒成之硯，最上者曰鱔魚黃，其次爲綠頭砂。再次爲玫瑰紫。</p>
<p>鱔魚黃　色如鱔魚肚，以火黃爲貴；　　綠頭砂　色淡靑黑，亦稱蟹殼靑；</p>
<p>玫瑰紫　有淡紅深紅兩種。</p>
<p>深紅者日人稱爲蝦頭紅，以其色悅目，且甚少，故日人最爲寳愛，以重價購求之。然其實澄泥之可寳貴，在質之細潤而不在色也。再此種澄泥，於黃色上見有斑點如豆，大者爲豆瓣砂，細者爲菉豆砂，有者皆發墨，如端之有眼之可貴也。又有一種有細砂黑暈數重，其貴重亦同於端之美紋。</p>
<p>從前又有五色澄泥之名，人每以爲係各色澄泥硯之總稱，然其實確别有一種五色澄泥硯，余藏一大澄泥硯，面上似蟹殼靑，側視之則隠然分黃紅黑數層，實可稱爲五色的澄泥也。總之，澄泥硯爲士林所珍重者，必爲唐宋時代之舊硯，泥皆取於水中，極凈細，陶製又極得法，故不乾渴，亦不傷筆，若後人仿製之硯，則僅可供俗吏字匠之用，或士子携以應試，利其於風　寸　中速濃耳。</p>

<h3>靑島巿敎育應行改進要點　敎部專員之視察報告</h3>
<p>敎育部前次派員視察靑島巿敎育、視察結果、業經呈報敎部、該項報告、對於靑島巿敎育、應行改進之意見、茲探誌於左、</p>
<p>（一）該巿敎育局之組織、大致尙合、督學二人與科員三人、分任五鄕區、常川指導、尤爲妥適、惟如能將總務科稍加緊縮、學校敎育科略事擴充、以初等敎育與中等敎育兩股、代替原有之學校敎育行政與學校敎育設計兩股、則辦事效率、當更可增高、</p>
<p>（二）該巿近三年來、敎育經費每年均能增加三萬餘元、惟爲謀現有敎育基礎之鞏固、及今後之安定發展起見、敎育經費應卽設法保障其獨立、其各項支配成數、亦應遵照部令、詳加確定、</p>
<p>（三）巿立各校學生免繳學費辦法尙合、該巿敎育局、現爲擴充敎費來源起見、擬有酌收學費計劃、此在中學方面尙屬可行、惟小學師範職業及各級學校女生、應以繼續豁免爲是、</p>
<p>（四）該巿學齡兒童夫學者、尙有三分之二、應卽擴充學額或增加班級、女生入學者不多、宜加勸奬、</p>
<p>（五）該巿公私立中學之整頓及改組、應遵照本部第四八九號指令、切實辦理、</p>
<p>（六）該巿中小學校舍、均頗堅實美觀、此後增建、應注意校址之是否適中、建築形式之是否相宜、以及敎室容量是否有擴充學額之凖備等問題、</p>
<p>（七）各校敎學設備、雖歲有增益、但仍不免失之簡陋、應由該巿敎育局擬具充實各校內容之最低限度的具體計劃　儘於最短期間內實現、</p>
<p>（八）小學敎員、宜聘用明瞭地方情形、能運用國語、且對於地方敎育富有熱忱者充任、</p>
<p>（九）會考試題範圍應將各學年所授敎材、同時注意考查、不宜遽定第三學年之題材應佔三分之二之分量、</p>
<p>（十）所擬奬學金規程四種、用意尙是、惟應設法見諸實行、中學貧寒優材生之貸費數額、及免費種類、應再詳加規定、</p>
<p>（十一）該巿社會敎育辦理頗有成績、惟民衆敎育工作、以由本地人擔任、較爲相宜、社敎人員訓練班之入學資格、不妨從寬規定、並得由各區及公共機關團體、酌量保送、</p>
<p>（十二）民衆敎育之推廣、可與當地黨部聯合進行、以增加其工作力量、女子補習學校課程、應注重職業訓練、以期切合實際生活之需要、</p>
<p>（十三）全國檢查電影工作、統歸中央辦理、不屬地方敎育行政範圍、該巿敎育局、檢查電影之組織、應卽撤銷以重功令、</p>

<h3>金融巿奄無生氣</h3>
<p>最近數日中金融界氣象、除週初以電滙到滬孔繁而後、各方面營業上需要不甚瑣繁、遂致收解情形頓又岑寂、卽巿塲中洋拆亦毫無變化、早午兩巿仍爲三分、劃頭加水始終白劃、拆票交易、早巿轉賬四百五十餘萬、新交易三十餘萬、午巿交易僅十餘萬、小總會中交易四十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖五十餘萬、新做出九十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出一百六十餘萬、客路來源去胃仍二十萬、銀行收解、外商銀行收解票欵一百七八十萬、各種貨匯押墊雜欵收解三百七八十萬、進倉五十萬、華商銀行收解票欵二百五六十萬、各種貨匯稅押雜欵收解四百六七十萬、出倉四十萬、日商銀行收解票欵二百十餘萬、各種貨匯雜欵收解三百七八十萬、進倉二十萬、錢莊洋公單收解三千九百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解四百二十餘萬、各路匯欵三十餘萬、解現二三十萬、又本巿票據交換所十二日交換總數、銀元五百九十二萬九千八百四十元零五角九分、內計銀元二百九十七萬零三百九十三元一角四分、匯劃銀元二百九十五萬九千四百四十七元四角五分、</p>

<h3>廠商賣出遠期美棉</h3>

<h3>糧食粉麥都在靜止中</h3>
<p>粉巿上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平定盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小四八分不等、坎拿大好八分零、故開價後、各月份交易、仍然清寂、布價亦少上落、此種情形、純爲農村經濟衰落之後、各業之消費無形减少、遂致市氣蕭然、無可振奮耳、迨至下午開盤、各盤交易、更見清淡、六盤中祇做四萬餘包、以廠方不動、價少出入、觀此種景象、恐非到新貨接近之際、難望活絡也、結果本月份微好二厘半、五六月份好五厘、七九月份未動、八月份好五厘、</p>
<p>麥巿上午開盤後、各月份巿面、完全空拍、沉寂之情、可以想見、迨至下午開盤、亦祇七八月份、略有交易、餘仍空拍、巿價因賣買沉寂、一無出入、據業中人之見解、新麥苗各地景象、均見秀發、惟日來天時陰寒多雨、人心遂稍鎭定、此後天時一佳、或須變動也、現麥巿况、尙見活絡、到貨接續、價尙站定、開徐州麥三元五角半、宿州三元五角二分、瑤灣麥三元五角二分、計三千包、由福新華豐辦去、</p>
<h3>厚薄稻似轉定勢</h3>

<p>（滬北）昨日各帮到頭三十六七號、巿銷平常、白粳價跌近角、羊埠客尖穏定、變陰元小近角、早　稻小六七分、</p>
<h3>絲茶春寒多雨有礙春蠶</h3>
<p>（杭屬孵種延不出蟻）　浙杭各縣蠶汛最早、均於清明節前後着手孵種、今歲臨平餘杭長安海寗各巿鄕農民、一律孵育改良種、無如天時不正、乍寒乍熱、近更春雨連綿、氣候嚴寒、致早帮所孵之種、延不出蟻、現均進行補育晚蠶種、孵額較早帮爲多、四鄕桑芽尙未苞靑、此後天氣若轉晴暖、蠶事可望順利、</p>
<p>（廠經綢門續有補進）本埠洋莊絲銷已成死氣、去電均不見轉、而華絲商以江浙各屬春蠶發動、新繭轉瞬上巿、存絲仍厚、不敢扳價、忍痛傾售、綢門乘機補充缺貨、昨由華新等續進白廠經三十五包、價仍不振、</p>

<h3>論英雄</h3>
<p>— 綬</p>
<p>偉大底科學家，思想家，藝術家之產生，必定要有適當的環境。而一個民族文明的進步，却全靠他們。俗語說時勢進英雄，但英雄也造時勢，大概是的確的。</p>
<p>但我們的英雄，是些什麽樣的人物呢？是狄鏗司，艾迪生，達汶西，盧梭，克理蒙梭之流麽？至少，我們所理想的英雄是這班人物麽？抑是韓信，蕭何，樊噲，甚而至於諸葛亮，魯肅，甚而至於左宗棠，李鴻章呢？</p>
<p>無可諱言，卽算自己没有弄清楚李鴻章是那一朝代的人物，幹了些什麽勾當，招牌上仍然要寫着他。卽算自己的才能捧不起李鴻章的一隻脚，招牌也仍然要掛起他。自號諸葛孔明已經不甚「摩登」了，因爲歷來這麽自况的人太多，尤其是看相算命者流，丨丨他也是臥龍！丨丨便覺得有此江湖氣，而且滑稽了。而許多英雄和候補英雄，他們的理想中的時代，也還是漢，三国，或滿清！</p>
<p>雖然，這還是「上焉者」也。也還要讀了幾本史鑑，或看過三国志演義的人才行。普通人的理想民英雄，是要能住高樓大厦，有良田廣宅，不可無一册堂皇的家譜，更不可無十個兒子，百個孫子，千個曾孫之類……</p>
<p>然而對於尙不具備這些條件的人們仍然敬仰者何也？那是怕他们將來要化爲英雄，卽所謂「候補英雄」者流。　　於是乎依照這種傳統的封建思想，這民族裏便生不出不同一點的英雄，而在這所謂二十世紀的世界中，景况便黯淡下去，衰落下去。有誰想做大科學家，大藝術家的，不爲今世所容，大家將他們踐踏，擠死！或者引誘他們墮落，頽唐！</p>
<p>偉大的思想决不能產生於墮落的民族！試思普通內地人有一點什麽較偉大底刺激？看到了一個科學家的銅像？或聽到了一番高深的音樂？抑是玩弄八仙打麻將牌的廣告　和聽「搖一搖……」的催眠曲去了？</p>
<p>再來幾十百千席「維新」吧！從「地球是圓的」講起！</p>

<p>然而，你不必計較，杭州人</p>
<p>有他們的理論折服你··這個時節到杭州來的人們，是爲用錢而來的，旣來杭州，多化幾毛或幾元錢算得什麽？况且杭州人全靠這幾天賺幾個錢呢？</p>
<p>當然有很多闊氣的游客，多化幾毛幾元以至幾十百元是滿不在乎的。但像我這樣的游客却要計較，因爲多化不起錢，這恐怕是杭州人最不歡迎的游客了。遊西湖怎想便宜？</p>
<p>然而，卽使有錢遊西湖，也並不是怎樣有趣的事情。譬如你雇一隻划子去游湖，舟子便敎你一個固定的公式··從湖濱出發，先到「三潭印月」，後到「汪莊」，然後再到「白雲菴」而「凈寺」而什麽莊而……又至何</p>
<p>處吃中飯，至何處回頭。我游杭州三次，因爲每次的侣伴不同，且都未曾到過杭州，故游湖時均循他們的意思，雇划子作竟日游，而三次的游程完全一樣。我呌這種游法，是八股文式的游法，其實最無意思。　　游西湖的最好的方法是用兩隻脚跑和爬，跑得愈遠，爬得愈高，趣味愈豐。他如乘船，坐轎，趁車，都非游賞之道也。</p>
<p>我這一回雖然又作了一次八股文式的游湖，但也曾有一次趣味的爬山，且在這次爬山中，證明了自己是可以驕傲的人</p>
<p>物。</p>
<p>我所爬的是北高峯（名日高峯），但在生長在山間的我看來，並不以爲高，爬起來是毫不費力的。因爲相信了自己的爬山能力，同時也相信了我的侣伴的能力，我的侣伴是我的妻和妻的姊姊，還有一個是我的生　九月的孩子。</p>
<p>孩子當然不能爬山，而且還得我們抱了她上去。關於這，我們並不想到是個難題。會抱的人是有三個，輪流地還怕不能所她送上峯頂麽？在乍暖的天氣之下，我們從靈隠寺的大門口，一步一步的前進，上昇，孩子常從這雙手臂到那雙手臂地轉換，　到了中途，三個人雖然都流出汗來，但毫不覺得辛苦，一意要爬上高峯。</p>
<p>在韜光以下的時候，還没有什麽，一到韜光以上，可就有趣了。許多坐在轎子裏的摩登女郎，洋裝紳士，見了我們，無不露出驚訝之色，有的說道··</p>
<p>「你看他們帶了一個「毛頭」</p>
<p>上北高峯，多麽不怕吃力！」有的欽羨地說··「他們多勇敢」！</p>
<p>有一位小姐甚至好意地警告我們道··</p>
<p>「這是性命交關的呀，萬一在山上跌一交，孩子怎麽得了？」</p>
<p>對於這些「錦注」，我們一律報以微笑。我們雖然也覺得稍微有點「吃力」，但對於自己的腿，非常信任，决不至於「跌一交」，弄得「性命交關」的。</p>
<p>直爬上了北高峯，俯視下面的許多空手的靑年男女，拉着「司的克」還屢次休息若不勝困苦的樣子，我們眞不自禁有點驕傲了。但我們又不敢過於驕傲，因爲看到那些抬着别人上山的轎夫，實在比我們更勇敢，更有氣力。</p>
<p>然而，那些紳士小姐們却並不注意轎夫們的勇敢而只注意我們。在概在他們意中，轎夫们是原該有此氣力的，而我們，則表面上也有點像讀書人，今竟亦有些氣力，所以可異罷。</p>
<p>若由我們想來，則坐轎的人們中，本該也有爬山的氣力，只是坐慣了轎，那些氣力纔消失了。我們之所以保存着一點氣力，正因不曾坐慣轎子耳，並没有什麽可異的。</p>
<p>游了杭州，没有什麽可記，僅有以上的一點，說是遊記，那是太殺風景了，故名遊杭雜感」。</p>
<h3>汶瀾橋畔（續）</h3>
<p>— 莫明女士</p>
<p>「眞没見過呢，這樣的世界！」一個没有一點風的夏天的黄昏，照例在橋上倚着欄杆的五叔公，一隻手托住竹烟筒，另一隻手捋着斑白了的鬍子，感歎地說了。「我年輕的時候，這鄕下的有錢人都把田地改種桑了；可是，怎樣也不夠用。因爲絲廠比母貓生孩子更快，一年便可以多出十間八間來丨丨」這老頭兒咳了一頓，然後吐了口痰到欄杆外面，讓流水把他底怨氣帶到什麽地方去。「我那付老骨頭都磨光了，眼看這幾年來收成多了丨丨比三十年來我見過的還要多，可是價錢就比我有辫子的時候還便宜呢……」</p>
<p>「我們所得到的，那里是我們想要的哩！」那常常沉默，講起話來却像撩弄人家底骨頭罅似的大牛說了。「比如我們要的是飯，而給我們的偏偏是小孩。這對於兩家都是無益的呀。」</p>
<p>坐在石頭級上捧着隆起的肚子的，他底瘦弱的妻子，像不滿意似地用眼晴釘了他一下。</p>
<p>有一次，他說了一些古怪的話，使得人們都以爲他不知着了什麽迷了。他是這樣說的··</p>
<p>「人第一不要强壯，這件事能夠毁壞人底靈魂！你看，鄕下的人都是磨折不死，餓不死的；可是，那裏有一個完全的，有三魂七魄的人呢？」他說話的時候是那樣地憤憊激動，所以眼晴充滿了紅絲。「眞的，將來不是人類底靈魂完全毁滅，就是鄕村這東西一定要消滅的。」他底聲音變得更高亢了。</p>
<p>那時以父老自居的五叔公站起身來，吐了口涎沫，一邊走開一邊搖頭說··「可怕的傢伙！不過，世界上的事情，誰料得到哩！」</p>
<p>那年的秋季，我便離開了故鄕。後來聽說是就在那年「淡月」的時候，永祿叔把大牛解雇了。他說的話將更使同伴們無可奈何地搖頭，他簡直是一匹在漆黑的，深夜裏狂呌的狗，引得其餘的狗都不安地吠起來。第二年夏天的時候，汶瀾橋畔没有了他底踪影，大概是到保育他底靈魂的地方去了吧。</p>
<h3>棉花丨江北民謠丨</h3>
<p>— 張鳴春</p>
<p>棉花！棉花！待你不差。</p>
<p>費了千辛萬苦，</p>
<p>到頭你是寃家！</p>
<p>折頭，擁根，</p>
<p>刮水，鏟草，</p>
<p>早出晚歸家，</p>
<p>十天九不飽！</p>
<p>天要下雨，心裏如麻，</p>
<p>夜裏睡不着，想你就開花。</p>
<p>今天雨小，明天雨大，</p>
<p>一陣歡喜，一陣駭怕，</p>
<p>没得歡喜只有怕，</p>
<p>倒頭血水兒落越大。</p>
<p>我靠你繳租，</p>
<p>你望水上浮；</p>
<p>我靠你還債，</p>
<p>你望水裏一蓋；</p>
<p>棉花！棉花！</p>
<p>你爛剩一條筋，</p>
<p>我苦呀傷了心！</p>
<h3>西游日錄</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>一九三四年（甲戍）·三月二十八日，（舊二月十四）星期三，大雨，寒冷如殘冬。</p>
<p>晨四時，亂夢爲雨聲催醒，不復成寐；起來讀歙縣黃秋宜少尉黃山紀遊一卷，係前申報館仿宋聚珍版之鉛印本，爲屑五叢談二集中之一種。這遊記，共二十五頁，記自咸豐九年己未八月二十八日從潭渡出發去黃山，至同年九月十一日重返潭渡間事。文筆雖不甚美，但黃山的偉大，與夫攀涉之不易，及日出，雲昇，松虬，石璧，山洞，絶　飛瀑，溫泉諸奇景，大抵記載詳盡，若去黃山，亦可作導游錄看，故而收在行篋中。</p>
<p>昨是得上海信，知此次同去黃山遊者，還有四五位朋友，膳宿旅費，由建設廳負擔，沿路陪伴者，由公路局派往，奉憲遊山，雖難免不貽丨山靈忽地開言道··「小的靑山見老爺！」丨之譏，然而路遠山深，像我等不要之人無產之衆，要想作一度壯遊，也頗非易事。更何况脚力不健，體力不佳，無徐霞客之膽量，有阮步兵之猖狂，若語堂光旦等輩，則尤非借一點官力不行了。</p>
<p>午後四時，大雨中，忽來了一張建設廳的請帖，和秋原增嘏語堂等到杭，現住西湖飯店的短簡。冒雨前去，在西湖飯店樓下先見了一羣文縐縐的同時出發之遊覽者及許多熟人；全葉潘林，却雅興勃發，已上西冷印社，去賞玩山色空濛的淡妝西子了。佇候片時，和這個那個談談天氣與舊遊之地，約莫到了五點，四位金剛，方纔返寓。亂說了一陣，並無原因地哄笑了幾次，我們就决定先去吃私菜，然後再去陪官宴。吃私菜處，是寰宇馳名的王飯兒，官宴在湖濱中行别業的大廳上。</p>
<p>私菜吃完，趕至湖濱，中行别業的大廳上，燈燭輝皇，擺滿了五六桌熱氣蒸騰的菜。在全堂哄笑大嚼的亂噪聲中，又决定四十餘人，分五路出發；一路去南京蕪湖，一路去天台雁宕，一路去紹興寗波，一路去杭江沿綫，一路去徽州，直至黃山。語堂增嘏光且秋原，申報館的徐天章興時事新報館的吳寳基兩先生，以及小子，是去黃山者，同去的爲公路局的總稽查金　甫先生。</p>
<p>遊臨安縣玲瓏山及錢五墓</p>
<p>三月二十九日，星期四，晴　　昨晚雨中夾雪，喝得醉醺醺回來的路上，心裏頗有點兒猶豫；私下在打算，若明天雨雪不止者，則一定臨發脫逃，做一次旅行隊裏的Renegade,</p>
<p>好在不是被招募去的新兵，罪名總没有的。今晨五六點鐘，探頭向窗帷缺處一望，天色竟靑蒼蒼的晴了，不得已只好打着呵欠，連忙起來梳洗更衣，料理行篋。趕到湖濱，正及八點，一羣奉憲遊山者，早已手忙脚亂，立在馬路邊上候車子來被搬去了。我們的車子，出武林門，過保俶塔，向秦亭山脚朝西駛去的時候，太陽還剛纔射到了老和山的那一座黃色的牆頭。</p>

<h3>一個女人</h3>
<p>— 王越</p>
<p>當她靠着一種偶然的幸運，在這衖堂里停歇下來的時候，那在分隔開住宅和荒塲的牆脚下，像一支倒覆着的翻箕似的小棚，便也算是她的家了。</p>
<p>那是拿三節六七尺長的竹竿，和半張破草蓆，和一襲烏黑的麻布組成的。竹竿像舊式屋椽似的斜搭起來，一端搁在靠牆築成的垃圾箱上，另一端擱在土地上，用石塊壓着。在竹竿上面蓋上破蓆，當作屋頂，麻布則是負擔着牆壁的任務的，從側面斜垂到底，彷彿幕罩一樣，比起街頭和墳地，這是更像一處人類的巢穴的。</p>
<p>但上海是寸金之地，而且隨處都有着法律，也并不是白白地就能夠在這里停留，她需得爲這衖堂里的每一家人服役。劈柴，刷馬桶，洗滌不潔的用具和婦孺們的穢布。堂主人們受了生活的虐待，而要對生命施行反擊的時候，她還得白做一個人們洩氣的靶子，忍受不咒駡和口沬。</p>
<p>她是不會說話的，只能發出一串「唔唔」的不明確的聲音。因爲她的鼻子和上唇的交接處　　　經　爛了。但在先前，她確是有過一付很合用呼吸器官的。她曾經用牠來享受過田野的草花的氣息，春天的泥土的氣息，和秋天成熟了的穀稻的氣息。在新婚之夜，她還爲第一次嗅着的男性的分泌物而没人沉醉。</p>
<p>那丈夫是一個慣把破氈帽蓋在後腦上的脚色，一個老實的莊稼漢。而且和其他的一些老實的農夫一樣，把衆汗洒向土里，而却把命運頂在他們的頭上。但在一回秋天，當他從老爺那里畫了十字轉來的時候，他把破氈帽向空肚的稻桶里一慣；</p>
<p>「做牠條鳥啊！」</p>
<p>於是他决心帶了她，他的女人，到這有着三百萬居民的都巿來了，預備把肩背從土地的軛下移向鋼鐵的軛下。拿破鍋翻蓋在床舖下面，打好包袱，他們套起草鞋走路了。在一處巿鎭上，他們從板帶里挖出藏好了的洋錢，買了船票。在航行上，他們爲輪船的龐大和機器的燥響所惶惑，害羞着自己的家造鞋和土布大褂。而且，他們的心也和他們的舉止一樣的張惶··先前還看得清楚的，那能夠攫取生存的目的地，現在是糢糊而且顯得嚇人了。</p>

<h3>近世成功秘訣談</h3>
<p>— 姑射</p>
<p>近世成功秘訣，第一是在「投機」。只要能投機，没有不成功的。固然，投機也有失敗的，因此而身敗名裂，甚至召殺身之禍，但現社會上，因投機而成功的，還是絶對地多。所以，投機還是現社會上唯一成功的秘訣。</p>
<p>投機的方法，最緊要是要能觎凖現社會的弱點，從這弱點用力進攻下去。現社會的弱點在那裏呢？第一，是在欺騙。欺騙是現社會唯一構成的骨幹。只要你能欺騙，没有不成功的。譬如，你到外洋學了一點什麽東西回來，便可自稱博士碩士，再偷竊一些外洋不甚精要的東西，或零篇短簡，炫燿於國人之前曰··這是什麽，解釋得非常奥妙奇怪。好在中國文化程度本來低，一般人見識不廣，看你這樣矜奇炫怪，便也信以爲眞，覺得其中奥妙無窮，非君莫辨。於是，你的名人學者的地位，無形之間，便由此造成了。而其實呢，還不是不過那麽一回事？折穿了看，你手中實是一無所有。這便是以欺騙爲成功秘訣之一例。其他類此之事正多。上至政台，下至一般社會，莫不皆是。總而言之，你只要能表面上做得好看，嘴頭上說得好聽，管他內容腐敗到怎樣不堪，自然會有一般人來相信你的。這是現社會投機方法之一，通稱之曰「賣野人頭」。其次便是「虛僞」。這也是現社會唯一重要的弱點。虛僞最實際的表現，便是現社會上所通得之所謂拍馬與吹牛。但這裏所謂拍馬與吹牛，並不如一般人粗淺的看法，一望而知爲惡劣低等的吹拍的段，他是要以更巧妙的方法去運用的。一般說來。便是要四面八方兜得轉，四面八方都相信得過。無無如何，不要得罪人，就是得罪人，也要得罪得有意義；無論如何，不要使你所應該倚靠的人覺得你討厭，就是討厭你，必須是一般不關緊要的人，這樣，你的成功便達到了，因爲，社會上目前已經很需要你，你已成了名人中間所不可缺少的一位人物了。　　以上，便是現社會成功秘訣的兩個不二法門。一言以蔽之，便是要能觎凖現社會的弱點下力攻。欺騙，虛僞，都是現社會最重要的弱點，你能在此用工</p>
<p>夫，結果當然没有不成功的。此外，迎合風尙，揀最時髦而又比較穏妥的路走，也是成功不二法門。這本是投機兩字中應有之通義，這裏也不必細述了。　　然而，我們要記着，這都是没落了的社會中的成功之路！眞正的成功之路，還是要「苦幹」！時代前的靑年們，你們要走向没落之路嗎？那末前述方案。是成功不二法門；否則，要逹到眞正的成功，還只有「苦幹」！無論是事業上，學問上，個人的，社會的，只有苦幹，才能達到眞正的成功！任你怎樣能投機取巧，雖能得意一時，但結果必然葬送了你光明的一生！千萬記着！我們眞正的成功秘訣是在這裏！</p>
<h3>由坍屋慘劇想起的話</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>前日大風中，閘北新疆路南林里發生一坍屋慘劇，壓斃女婢一名，傷五人。緣該里第一弄至第五弄，建築最早，逾三十年，已朽舊不堪。故一陣風過，便例傾五幢，肇此不幸禍事。</p>
<p>房屋建築之堅固與否，關係於居民之安危至鉅。上海住宅，雖壯觀雄麗之高樓魏厦，滿目皆是，然此大都爲銀行公司和大商店的建築物，以及富家闊老的公館另墅，故能建造得旣牢且固，穏當非常。不但狂風暴雨火災地震不足以損壞牠，恐怕就是用炸彈來炸，也有炸不倒之勢。至若許多普通里弄，外觀也許看起來頗像個樣子，內裏却是粗草不堪。原因這些里弄，是一班房屋業者所經營，用以租給二房東和三房客者，故當他們計劃建築之初，便打好算盤，在「付最低資本，收最大利益」的原則下，大興土木起來了，。由是竣工後的房子，基礎旣不穏固，墻壁亦甚細薄，所用的磚瓦木板等材料，盡是劣等貨品。致房屋建造未久，便覺十分破朽。一遇大風雨或地震，常有坍倒之虞。火神下降時，災禍更是無法幸免。且房屋經過若干年，不免瓦破磚碎，棟腐樑朽，墻欹壁斜，應時加巡視補蓋，才不危險。可是他們房產業者那裏顧到這些？他們將房宅租給二房東，除逐月按日派人來收房租是永不爽約外，一切便好像没有責任了。有時房客看到房屋壞了，去要求他們來修理，他們非萬不得已，總是推三托四，一味拖延。於是坍屋慘禍，時有所聞。他們不惟把居民的安危，置之不問，更顧不到房客生計的困迫，常喊着要加租。今日全上海巿减租運動之勃興，便是這種剥削的結果。此運動雖已四方響應，氣勢浩大，而房產業者却故示鎭靜，不作聲息，致至今相持未决，風潮時起。然我們敢相信，這種幾百萬巿民的合理要求，總有達到最後勝利的一天。</p>
<p>如上所述，上海房產業者對於房屋的建築和管理，這樣不加意，其關係於居民之安危，何等重大。爲顧全房客之安全起見，今後希望一般房主對於這一事稍爲改善。建造房屋，地基務必打得穏固，墻璧務必築得堅牢。遇有傾頽情形，則須急速修葺。歲月過久，亦當重新翻造。一面政府當局，對此又應十分關心。不但要嚴密監督其建築情狀，且須時加巡視各地房屋，逢有破損，輕則令其彌補，重則責其翻建。房屋年限一到，又必促其立卽拆卸，以防不測。至房客自己，更不可漠視本身之安危。租屋之時，最緊要者，應注意房屋是否堅固。有危險須遷移爲妥，或通知房東修補。不聽卽報告官廳，加以取締。如此則將來坍屋傷人慘事，或可稍减，這於居民安全，未始無益。</p>
<h3>西子湖畔（上）</h3>
<p>— 澹心</p>
<p>春假之暇，組織了個五人團，到湖山勝景甲天下的西子湖上，去作第三次的遊覽，計二天晴二天雨之時間，怱怱地跑了一個遍。這種「走馬看花」的遊覽，雖然「淡裝濃林」都收入眼簾，可是要想在一個地方，摩挲古蹟，玩賞勝景，憑吊故人，追昔思今；來一個甚麽「感嘆」，「唏噓」，「吟哦」，或是靜默一下，簡直是因時間的鞭促而不允許，併且在現實的環境之下，竟似可不必。</p>
<p>「山山水水處處明明秀秀」「晴晴雨雨時時好好奇奇」這是湖畔中山公園裏面的一副對聯；把我眼中所見的一幕幕湖山勝景，都被這二十個字說完了，所以無容我再來甚麽「形容」，甚麽「描寫」來拉雜地叙述一下··</p>
<p>走進了凈慈寺，大殿没有了，正在大興土木，翻陳而新。領路的伕子，就講了下列一個有趣的故事··</p>
<p>「一天，凈慈寺來了個手持香燭的燒香女客，要到濟公殿裏燒香；忽然有</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>個小和尙，攔住了路，不讓他進去。方丈看見了，很怪這小和尙，不應該這樣得罪上門的主顧，責令小和尙走開。這女客就進去燒香。那知剛把香燒着，火燄上冲，就把濟公殿燒了。同時，小和尙也遍覓不見了。過了幾個月吧，忽然來了位廣東太太，要在該寺中，找一個嘗到廣東他家裏去化緣造濟公殿的和尙。如有這和尙時，很肯出錢造濟公殿。方丈明知没有和尙到廣東去化緣，而爲希冀萬一起見，就集合全寺的三百多僧衆，排列在大殿前，讓這位太太，一個個認去。據說一個也不是。正大徬徨乏味的時候，聰明的方丈就領他去看濟公的佛像，問可和這佛爺的面容相彷。廣東太太一看之下，不禁合十一拜，說是千眞萬確；於是非但捐錢造濟公殿且願把大殿拆卸，重建新殿；更在他處捐資建造放生池等等，共報七十餘萬元的巨欵。和尙都猜想那攔住燒香女客的小和尙，和去向廣東太太化緣的大法師，都是濟顚活佛顯聖哩。」</p>
<p>這眞是一則有趣的故事，濟公活佛能夠出來顯聖，無怪「時輪金剛法會」，要在靈隠寺去熱閙一下了。可不知班禪活佛，和濟公活佛誰的法力大，也許能來一個廣東太太外，更有個××太太，肯捐上個幾千百萬錢財，購上個幾千百隻飛機，把燒燬的東北角重行建築不算外，再賠上個朝鮮的收回，也未可知吧。而我們那位廣東太太眞是揮金若土，不知道要請他捐助些航空捐，接濟義勇軍捐，也能夠這樣揮重如土，也不？恐怕她也像袞袞諸公一樣，認定還是佛法無邊，祗願意在佛上結緣吧！</p>
<h3>第一次伸手索錢</h3>
<p>— 鑑因</p>
<p>一個人在襁褓中，他是不知不覺的；但是他只曉得餓了器着要東西吃，冷了器着要衣裳穿，此外他不再需要什麽了，這是多麽超絶的生活！</p>
<p>可是人是生了，不得不長大，等到長大，便不期然而期然的生出種種慾望來，要好的東西吃，要好的衣服穿，要好的玩物，要了這樣，又要那樣。因爲他没有經濟自立的能力，所以他的一切需要，非向父母討取不可。</p>
<p>後來漸漸知道世界上一切東西，都是金錢換來的，他于是不再討東西，而是要付銅錢了。因爲有了金錢，可以自由地換好的東西吃或玩，當他第一次向他的父母討錢的時候，那脆弱的心靈中，顯然的覺着一種莫名的快慰！</p>
<p>「媽丨給我一個銅板賣糖吃！」</p>
<p>他第一次向媽伸手索錢，就得媽媽以允許，那心中的愉快，是非言語可以形容的。</p>
<p>×　×　×</p>
<p>在現代社會的組織上，男子成爲中心樞紐，這是顯然的事實，在家庭裏，男子是握着金錢支配一切的權威，女子呢，可憐數千年迄今，仍舊是處于被動地位，依賴地位，卽是有智識有經濟自立能力的女子，一日與男子離起婚，必要求赡養費，難道男子不可以要求女子發給赡養費嗎？由這一層看去，女子始終是處于依賴地位的。</p>
<p>一個女子，在處女時代，她的吃用，全靠着父母的給養，但嫁了丈夫，她就仰給于丈夫了。在結婚後，當她第一次伸手向丈夫索錢的時候，她是感到怎麽的怩忸不安呢？</p>
<p>「喂！·········給我半塊錢，去買小菜。」</p>
<p>當丈夫允她的要求後，這經濟制度的成　，便根明白的表現出來。假使在一般有傲性的女子的心中，她應　何　覺到這是　　行動呀！</p>
<p>×　　×　　×</p>
<p>一個人漂泊着，回不得家鄕，爹娘去世了，朋友遠離了，他得不到　業，找不到飯吃，等到肚皮餓得不能忍受時，他難道眞個坐死不成？于是他爲了要拖延生命的繼續，不得不謀出路，但是左思右想。用盡了腦經，費盡了氣力，仍舊得不到一餐之飽，在不得已的情况下，于是他權充乞丐，向人家討錢了。　　討錢，是一件羞恥的事。誰也不願意幹。但爲了要生活，又有什麽法子？當他第一次伸手向路人討錢的時候，那是何等慚愧悲哀的事··</p>
<p>「先生……請……做好……事，給……一個……」</p>
<p>他平生向未朝人家這樣求憐過，他的聲音，微得像蒼蠅呌。簡直提不起勇氣說話。你想這時候的情况，路人答應他的要求，固然要感激零涕，如果路人不答應他的要求，乃是何等的悲哀呀！</p>

<p>大敎師拳頭都被李俊撥開，怏怏走了。李俊安慰蕭恩一番，便告辭去。</p>

<p>大敎師回報丁員外，說近來吃少了油葷··因此眼花打不中那混賬東西。</p>

<h3>滯留在都巿呀，還是回農村去？</h3>
<p>編者先生··</p>
<p>我現在有一個很嚴重的問題。雖然，它是我現下須急需解决的，可是，從廣義的範圍說來，也是當前全國靑年所需要解决的。</p>
<p>我是一個內地中學還未畢業的靑年，因受了農村破產，內地經濟崩潰的影響，中產階級是漸漸地没落了。因此，我的家庭，也感受到種種暴風雨的侵襲，經濟一天天地困難，我的求學問題，遂受到了嚴重的阻礙，祇得停止而急需找職業去。雖然，我自己很感覺到現在學識的還不夠，但在這種不合理的敎育制度下，「富的益智」，而「窮的益愚」，受了這種經濟的壓迫，壓根兒就不能想再進巍峨的學府。</p>
<p>於是，我終於在去冬的一個晚上，由一隻輪船，帶我到了上海，寄寓在一個親戚家裏。這是我家庭間的理想，或許也可說是鄕間大衆們唯一的猜測，他們以爲農村是决無生路可尋了，在「風中之燭」，「搖搖欲熄」的各種商業，是都不可靠而再無擴展的希望。所以，他們只以進都巿去爲理想的對象，這裏是有繁榮的商店，偉大的工廠，和富麗的銀行，洋行，眞是人們的「黃金之庫」；</p>
<p>他們願盡驅自己的子弟，到這洪爐裏去，以爲這是唯一的出路！</p>
<p>到滬已是第五個月了，轉瞬又將半年，可是，我依然是在家的我丨反是成了一個失業，做社會贅瘤的人了，不過，對於都巿的一切，現社會的種種，在這短短的過程中，却已有了相當的認識。每使我深深地感覺到，都巿只不過是繁榮的外殼，他暗裏却正藏着無數的尖刀，待人便戮，農村裏羣衆的蜂趨都巿，正是使都巿工商業多盡些壓榨的渣滓。使失業人或苦力及流氓等的加多，益暴露他矛盾，綺形，的罪惡。</p>
<p>在經過幾次嚴重的考慮和沉痛的嘗受後，我竟毅然决然地要脫離它，覺得我對都巿實是「無顔，」同時，我有一個叔父，却寫信給我，呌我到鄕下去，助他辦理農村小學。不過，報酬是很少，並且，須終年終日地埋在粉筆裏。</p>
<p>啊！先生！我親愛的先生！在這個環境下，你看還是留滯在都巿裏，等更好的機遇呢？還是竟不辭辛勞地重返鄕村去，幹敎員勾當呢，我眞有些「徘徊歧途」，使我「進退維谷」了。願先生能很明白的答覆我！黃亦然謹啓</p>
<p>答··這是個一般的問題；在農村裏，「决無生路可尋」，到了都巿又依然失業，也並不是奇事。所以黃君所提出的問題丨丨還是留滯在都巿裏，等更好的機遇呢？還是竟不辭辛勞地重返鄕村去，幹敎育勾當呢？在編者看來，是無法解答的，但就因其不能解答，却也不成問題了。農村不景氣，都巿也一定要衰落。黃君在農村裏没有出路，到都巿裏又無出路，則到那裏去不都是一樣的麽？然而這種各處都没有「出路」的塲合，决計不能持久，人們爲了要求生存，定然是要將没有出路變成有出路的。不過，問題不是在等待更好的機會，却是要觀察到這個没有出路的原因，而以集團的力量去謀解决罷了。因爲所謂失業，窮困等等問題者，是這個社會裏必然產生的現象，及「無業可做」也。黃君現在在鄕村裏旣能找到職業自然還是回去爲妙，在都巿旣有半年找不到職業，恐怕再坐下去，也不見得一定就會找到「更好的機會」。「手裏的一隻鳥，勝過林上兩隻鳥」黃君，黃君，還是回去吧！</p>
<p>總之，職業仗鑽營，奔走，等去解决是靠不住的，我們惟有希望社會上能夠不產生失業問題，人人有事做，我們纔有出路，但是要實現這種目的，就要奮鬥，不過這種奮鬥不是用個人爲前提，却要以「爲社會同時也是爲個人」爲努力的目標耳。編者</p>

<h3>骨肉之間（一）</h3>
<p>— 曼之</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>入秋以後，斜風細雨吹遍嶺南。雖然有的時候，一陣豆子般大的急雨衝散了人們的悶氣，但是那不過是一刹那的時間，又下得没有力氣似的令人發惱。城外通海那一條練江的洪水在猛漲着急流着。已經是炊烟滿城大地將黑的黃昏時候了，渡頭的渡船老大披着簔衣預備鎖船回家，對岸在雨裏站住一個人，一把紙傘兒遮着，看不到那是個什麽樣子的老哥，他放開喉嚨地在呌渡。老大將渡船撑開，嘴裏在咕嚕着，「大雨天，快黑了，還要呌渡上自己倒霉，還要呌人家倒霉，×母仔」！渡船近了岸，那人借個勢便跳上船頭來，老大心裏擔心着他下水，本想要說他一句下次這樣不行的話，但是也懶去說了。渡船過河，雖然在急流中撑拒，老大很費點力氣，却也有閒工夫將那人端詳一下··白布衫褲濕淋的水在裾邊滴，短小的身材，瘦削的面孔，灰白而又浮腫的臉色上面，目光好比野狐狸，那頭髮却長得怕人。好像有點臉熟，似乎曾經在什麽地方見過的？渡船靠了岸，那人放下兩個銅板，怱怱地趕入城裏去了。老大回頭看岸那邊還有人呌渡没有，没有，鎖了渡船，提了竹竿子回家。剛到了家裏坐下，吃了一口熟烟，忽然想起，那是鄭家雨亭六秀的兒子喲！不見他也已經兩三個年頭了，一向那裏去過？怎麽爰了相，弄到這樣難着？……老大簡戰的頭腦想不出也就吧了。</p>
<p>這時候，雨亭六秀六爺丨正在書齋裏頭一榻橫陳吞雲吐霧地抽大烟。窓外綠芭蕉的葉兒上面，雨聲晰晰瀝瀝地在打着；六爺將烟槍靠近燈火，嘶嘶地咄咄地抽着，正在飄飄然。鄭家的老用人普寗丨他是普寗縣的人，到了鄭家以後老爺太太們不呌他的性名，　呌他普寗順口些丨他靑白着臉，喘看氣，怱怱地跑進書房。他見六爺正在抽烟，站在旁邊不敢開口。六爷抽完了那烟斗上面的鴉片，嘶嘶聲停住，口裏吐出了一條直如長箭兒的白烟，放下烟槍就要入夢去。「六爺！」普寗輕輕地呌着。六爺唔地哼了一聲並不理會。普寗大聲一點地說了··</p>
<p>「六爺，在少爺回來啦？」</p>
<p>「那個回來？」六爺問了一聲，眼晴還不睜開，似乎夢裏很甜寗的呢。　　「　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　」</p>
<p>「鑑光嗎？回來了？」六爺說着那兩顆　般的小眼晴睜着嚇死人。同時猛然地從烟舖上面坐起身來。深究地問··「眞是那畜生嗎？」</p>

<h3>凱絲玲赫本涇（上）</h3>
<p>— 滄桑</p>
<p>凱絲玲赫本涇（Katharine　Hepburn）自從主演了「棄婦」和「小婦人」兩部影片後，已成爲膾炙人口的紅明星了，而導演這兩部影片的喬治葛谷（GeorgeCukor)却是她的知已。</p>
<p>當「小婦女」攝製的時候，她每天早晨九句鐘就上塲，每晚非到六點三十分不離去。這樣的九星期之久，她眞有食而不知其味的情景。她每天胡亂一餐，倒上床就睡，所以她在家的光陰盡是消磨在睡眠裏的丨肉體的休息。她的喜怒哀樂統統在攝影塲上，而喬治葛谷便是那裏的專制皇帝。他們在一塊兒完成了兩部影片之後，他們便成爲最知已的人。他們各人的內心赤裸裸的互相暴露了。其實，一個明星和導演彼此不了解各人的情感，决不會成功一部影片的。毒恨或羨慕，鄙視或敬重。他們儘可遮蓋世人耳目，却决不能互相掩飾着的。　　「小婦人」試片後，他對人說··「那是一部偉大的影片！」她說的神氣好象她自己在裏面没有分兒，她又說··「」它的所以偉大，是因爲喬治葛谷偉大呀。我要他爲我導演其他影片哩。我决不要隨便什麽人指導我。這須排定的。一部影片不會超過導演才具的。」</p>
<p>一位紅明星肯這樣的說丨自認她的成功歸於她的導演丨在好萊塢是値得大書特書的新聞。好大喜功，人情之常。但是凱絲玲赫本湼的歸功於喬治葛谷可以成爲號外上的大標題的。</p>
<p>凱絲玲赫本湼在塲的時候，製片塲是關閉着不許游客進去的丨好象嘉寳在那裏工作似的。但原因却是不同的。嘉寳見着鏡頭就害羞。赫本湼上鏡頭却是旁若無人似的。「她對着鏡頭就完完全全的放浪形骸了。有誰注視是没有關係的丨」這是喬治葛谷的口供，然而攝影塲是要關閉的，那不過因爲恐怕人家要誤會。誤會他們的打，喊，呌，以及常常發生的野蠻舉動。他們常要打的謠言已經傳遍內外了。有人且說，「我可賭咒，赫本湼每夜跪着祈禱，葛谷没有打死她呀！」她有時連器了三天。葛谷太認眞了。三在之後，他們又笑了，所以攝影塲竟象瘋人院。如其任人參觀，豈不要誤會他們發了痴嗎？</p>
<p>赫本湼的母親年事已高，却是美國康納的克特州的女權運動的健將。她們的完全是新式家庭。「不能」和「不許」等字樣在她們家裏是聽不到的。凱絲玲赫本湼可以爲所欲爲。她的父親是名醫，曾在後庭造了一座小小的戲台給她玩。這樣的家庭敎育，因使好萊塢的全部男女以及許多其他美國人都誤解了她。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「」仙侣情歌</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>The　Cat　and　the　Fiddle</p>
<p>丨大光明丨</p>
<p>當我們在慘酷的現實中，常感覺着莫可明言之苦痛的時候，自然在電影中常希望獲得眞實的縮影，而使人們對於社會，對於人生，有着更進一步的認識。「金山」「生路」以及在上海大戲院開映着的「亡命者」，其所以能够抓住我們全部情感；在我們心頭留下不可磨滅之印象的原因，很顯然的是實生活之偉大的展開，使我們不能不爲之感動。</p>
<p>然而，這種影片，到底是僅佔數量的極小部份，這因現實環境制限了這種影片之生長；另一方面，製造和支配這種惡劣環境的人們，他們知道不僅是壓迫電影之新的傾向，更要緊的是多量製作離開現實的影片，以取得掩蓋社會眞象而緩和民衆的憤恨情緒。</p>
<p>屬於這一類的影片，眞是五花八門，多至不可勝數，而「仙侣情歌」也是這一類的作品了。</p>
<p>它全篇没有嚴肅的展開社會問題，固不待言，而劇作者所要寫的僅僅是男女間戀愛糾紛，用巧合的方法使一些生疎的生活勉强的聯繫起來。關於這一點，我想没有再解釋的必要，反正它就祇是非現實的戀愛把戲，庸俗的牽强附會。雖然它也逐行了上述的粉飾太平的作品。</p>
<p>更進一步說，這一影片無非是爲了兩個大明星而編的歌劇。事實上因爲麥克唐納和諾伐羅還能够賣錢。不過，他們的黃金時代早已過去。這種賣假人頭的方法，在目前經濟恐慌深主的當中，似乎不大靠得住了。</p>
<p>也許，我們不會忘懷麥克唐納曾經哄動一時的「璇宫艶史」，然而在當時正因銀幕上的歌劇開始抬頭，人們都以驚異的眼光來注意這新的電影技術。到現在，歌無片已經悄悄的渡過了它的興盛時期，而逐漸形成了没落的現象。「四址二號街」或「華清春暖」，在電影技術發展史上，已經是登峯造極，一直到現在，像「影城艶史」之流，怕是不再引人注意了吧？同樣，這「仙侣情歌」在技術上更不如「四十二號街」之顃，難道還能</p>
<p>够作强有力之掙扎嗎？</p>
<p>至於諾伐羅，近年來除了在「明月香衾」還相當顯出了卓越的技藝之外，從前默片時代的光榮，到底是不能够繼續維持。在這「仙侣情歌」中，也祇有在前段可看出他活潑可愛的姿態。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我們可證明導演之不够把握了。在前面，他以輕鬆的手法，造</p>
<p>成活潑的空氣，自維克多和女相識以至女賣歌成富爲止。及後，却一變而爲沉滯晦澀了。這是他不能活潑到底的薄弱之處。然而這些都僅僅的技術問題，而整個的影片不曾給我們一點東西，郤是這一影片最大的損失。</p>
<h3>評「水國生香」</h3>
<p>— 憶君</p>
<p>NoMoreWomen丨國泰映</p>
<p>「水國生香」所描寫的題材是新鮮的。</p>
<p>在這裏是描寫二個潛水夫的生活，他們在太平洋的海底打撈沉船而搜取沉没的財物。那載了潛水衣的龐大的軀體，吐着泡沫，在水底行走的情狀確使我們感到新奇，雖然在這裏的眞實性還成問題的。</p>
<p>然而，「水國生香」可取的就祇那潛水夫的在水底生活的情形，其餘就再也不能給我們些什麽，那照例的三角戀愛，無聊的噱頭只是使我們感到厭倦。</p>
<p>二個潛水夫愛上了一個女船主，於是他們爲了名利，爲了戀愛而衝突着。在一個巿塲裏的一輛車上，他們開始互毆，而終於一個潛水夫給另一個打入了水裏，人們都以爲那個潛水夫死了，然而在船長知道了一隻載金二百萬的巨船沉没的消息，他又看到了那個潛水夫没有死，於是他便重又利用了這二個潛水夫出發撈那隻沉船，在海底，另一隻船上的潛水夫中傷了這一隻船上的潛水夫，然而幸虧另一個潛水夫把他救了起來，還滿載着黃金，於是二人前愆頓釋，言歸於好，而那個戀愛問題終究還没解决。</p>
<p>自然，這只是一個淺薄的故事，一船船員以至潛水夫的痛苦是没有在這裏暴露的，而且勸告潛水夫要抛棄前仇，爲一隻船服務而和别隻船爭鬥。</p>
<p>導演還値得稱贊。海底的爭鬥，車　　莎白</p>
<p>上的互毆，以及碼頭上的空氣都能够抓住觀衆的情緒。</p>
<p>愛德門羅與麥克勞倫並無特長可言</p>
<p>向今日南　開　史「　　　女　」女主角</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「風」觀後感</h3>
<p>— 徐海容</p>
<p>無疑的這張片子，必定有許多畫面又是被電檢查剪掉了，不然，爲什麽在演出上，我們會感到有很多突兀的地方呢？尤其是在後半部，這是很可惜的。　　例如在說明書上說的，小明和他的伙伴，反抗船主不發到期的工資，因爲聽說要到南島再發，倘要先支，須得依南島的銀價，扣水計算，但是結果，終究因爲他們受不了暴力的壓制而失敗了的一節，我們在全畫面上，却完全没有看到。</p>
<p>不過這張片子，雖然被剪掉了許多，可是牠對於資本家猙獰面目的暴露，社會層底內幕的描寫，依然是非常透澈，而値得我們贊揚的。</p>
<p>但我以爲在大風起兮的夜裏，實在是全片最緊張的一幕，導演者不該將夜園會狂樂的畫面，弄得那麽沉長，以致减少了劇本許多力量，這顯然是導演欠缺快度轉變的運用。</p>
<p>攝影和佈景，都是成功的，尤其是演員，一個個都使我們滿意，大可造就，我希望各演員能繼續努力。</p>
<h3>猶太明星主演的二部巨片在德被禁</h3>
<p>— 鶴琴</p>
<p>德國自從國社黨統治以後，不知什麽緣故，對於猶太民族好像是結了七世深仇一般，凡是有關於猶太人的事情，都遭他們不平等的待遇。最近有一部美國影片，因爲片中的男主角是猶太人，却遭德國當局禁映。這部片名呌（ＴｈｅＰｒｉｚｅ　ｆｉｇｈｔｅｒ　ａｎｄ　ｔｈｅ　Ｌａｄｙ），是由茂娜勞埃和麥克斯勃Ｍａｘ　Ｂａｅｒ　主演的，在未禁前的十天，這部片子在德開演，賣座是極盛，因爲麥克斯勃爾是猶太極有名的拳師，數月前曾擊敗得世界錦標的德國拳師，先末霖（Ｍａｘ　Ｓｃｈｎｅｌｉｎｇ），因此德國的觀衆都要去一看這位名是被禁映的一個極大原由吧。</p>
<p>在這部片子被禁映之前，有一部英國片子呌做「凱絲玲女皇」，亦被德國禁止了。其理由是因爲片中的女主角是猶太人，名呌伊烈莎白勃格納ＥｌｉｚｅｂｅｔｈＢｅｒｇｎｅｒ，她在這部片子裏是飾一個雍容莊嚴的女俄皇，據說是得到非常的成功的。</p>
<h3>凱塞琳女皇</h3>
<p>眞的非常之人，然後有非常之事，歷代中外的女主，决非是一個平凡的女子，所以這個全俄帝國的撫御統治，實在是十分不易的，何况宮幃之內，驕縱荒淫的生活，陰謀禍變的環境，也决非是一個平凡的事實。</p>
<p>偉大的凱塞琳並不是如吾們理想中那么偉大，她是小鳥般嬌媚而求愛不得的呀，可是她底智力畢竟造成了不少偉業和罪惡，假使罪惡是必需的。</p>
<p>帝俄史上重要人物之復活當然歸功於演員，導演和製造者，吾們不可不注意此片中德女明星伊麗莎白褒格娜及男主角小范朋克底表演天才，也不可埋没了克新納氏和科逹氏慘淡經營的苦心。</p>
<h3>「浪漫的」與問題的再展開</h3>
<p>— 胡越</p>
<p>（敬答木天先生）</p>
<p>關於羅浮先生和木天先生在「烈焰」問題上的爭辯，本來已經有了相當的結論，我也不想多嘴了。但是木天先生旣被「觀感與印象以外」激動得「冉講幾句話」，而對我的話，又有點深文周納，我也是只得作一個小小的聲明。</p>
<p>「象徵的」一點，木天先生並没有指名同我討論，到看不過的時候，再來寫一點我的意見吧，這裏暫且不談。</p>
<p>因爲作者的世界觀是創作方法上的基本要素，從來文學史上各種五花八門的主義，我們可以歸納爲兩股丨丨正如世界觀的發逹史上所可歸納的兩股丨丨對立的主流，那就是觀念論的，與唯物論的。（什麽是觀念論唯物論，已經是常識的最初步了，木天先生可以允許我不再加解釋了吧。）</p>
<p>在文學史上，這對立的兩股主流表現爲各種不同的姿態，在近代，就有浪漫主義與寫實主義的對立。</p>
<p>十八世紀後期至十九世紀前期，在西歐文學上浪漫主義的確立，不管它在各國各社會層因不同的客觀的物質條件而發生不同姿式，它總是古典主義的否定，與寫實主義的淸道夫。它是過渡期時產物，布爾喬亞汜文學發展上的一個階叚，而不可避免地存在着封建貴族的遺的。這就是木天先生所告訴我們的，有封建的浪漫主義者，與小巿民的浪漫主義者的分别。代表地主貴族的意識的浪漫主義，是迥避現實的，没落的，而代表勃興的巿民意識的浪漫主義是向上的，「也是有其現實性的」，這就是我在「現感與印象以外，」所以說不是「凡」浪漫主義都是要不得的，或者用木天先生的話，不都是現實主義的否定，與迴避現實的一個原因。</p>
<p>但是我說不是「凡」浪漫主義都是要不得的主要原因，已經深化到「革命的寫實主義」與「革命的浪漫主義」了，這一點木天先生自然已經懂得的。然而好像，「向上的」浪漫主義和革命的浪漫主義要本上還有點不同，後者原來是社會主義的，因此，它不僅不是要不得的，而且是必要的！</p>
<p>「烈焰」中的阿桂，描冩得是個理想化的（但並不是空想的，否定現實的。）人物，但是這是可以容許的。</p>
<p>本來這些都是常識，一九二八年以來的新文化運動，究竟不是没有成績的，這種常識似乎已經不是詩不和作家們所獨佔的了，雖然可憐得很，這種轉輾販買來的常識，也常常要遭受到危運。然而，木天先生却一定要把浪漫主義「分析」一下，而拿給我們看的，却又只是一點常識，使我也不得不說點常識的話了。</p>
<p>至於我說標語口號主義已被淸算過，並不是要同作家的實踐分離，而是說那個問題已經太舊了，何况我們實在不能以「烈焰」中我出標語口號主義來。在戀愛與「風花雪月」的問題上，我們只能說「革命與戀愛矛盾」的定型描寫的要不得，究竟「烈焰」中是否「胡調的戀愛占優位」？帶着歇斯迭里的性質的話，那麽，我們也應大大地考究一下的。</p>
<p>文章一句句解釋給别人聽，眞是多麽困難的事。但是我之先生在「打一個抱不平」中指出的値得再展開的問題，以及木天先生在「抗議」中提供尊貴的意見，都是很重要的。我很想看看這些問題被怎標解決，或者在詩人與作家面前，還要不自量力的插一下嘴</p>

The five will remain in Linhe to be responsible for handling all aftermath matters. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Beiping Sun's Army is now actively preparing for disbandment, determined to eliminate the weak and retain the strong. The maintenance fees stipulated by the military council have begun to be issued. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Beiping Baotou Telegraph: 1. 926 soldiers of Sun's disbanded troops have each been issued disbandment fees of four yuan, two steamed buns, and a disbandment certificate. 2.

<p>Beiping Six representatives of the people from the three provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, including Ma Rui, visited He Yingqin on the morning of the 12th, presenting him with a silver shield made by them. He personally received them. In addition to thanking He for suppressing the rebellion, the representatives also requested that he relay to the Central Government the need to provide relief to the disaster-stricken people.

<h3>Japanese Abolish All Northeast Railway General Bureaus</h3>
<p>‖Reorganize into Four Major Railway Bureaus‖</p>
<p>Beiping Railway News: The Japanese have recently abolished all Northeast Railway General Bureaus and reorganized them into four major railway bureaus under the South Manchuria Railway Company. The Fengshan and Shenhai lines will be merged into the First Bureau, the Sitao, Taoang, and Taosuo lines will be merged into the Second Bureau, the Qike, Huhai, Beihai, and Bei'anzhen branch lines will be merged into the Third Bureau, and the Jichang, Jihai, and Labin lines will be merged into the Fourth Bureau. The directors of each bureau have been announced, and the deputy directors are all Japanese. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Stamps Discovered on Letters in the Capital</h3>
<p>Nanjing A letter recently sent from the Northeast was discovered in the capital, bearing a red three-cent "Manchukuo" stamp with the image of "Dagushan." The center of the stamp features a double phoenix, with the words "Ascension to the Throne Commemoration" printed above and "Manchukuo Post Office" printed below. The four corners mark the denomination, just like our national stamps. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Nanjing A reporter interviewed Yu Feipeng, who stated that the Japanese puppet regime has repeatedly requested postal communication with us, but our side has consistently refused to recognize them. Since mail from the Northeast is delivered to within the passes, within our country's scope and ability, all such mail should be detained and not transmitted. However, counterfeit stamps have now been discovered on letters in the capital. I will instruct the responsible person to inquire in detail whether the post office was negligent and mistakenly delivered them. If it is found to be true, they will be severely punished. Furthermore, the person in charge of the Postal Department stated that the infiltration of counterfeit stamps into our country is due to our country's open doors, which are difficult to close tightly. For example, Japanese ships carry counterfeit letters from Dalian to the interior of our country along the Yangtze River, and use our ignorant and foolish people, or Japanese people disguised as Chinese, to deliver them. Occasionally, they are inadvertently mixed in. It is speculated that this type of mail is likely delivered by Japanese ships. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Stationed Japanese Troops in Beiping Conducted Exercises in Two Batches Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Liu Guitang's Bandits Invade Wangtaizhen; Pursuing Troops Are Encirclement from All Sides; Serious Alert Along the Jiaoji Railway; Part of the Bandits Seemingly Fleeing South Towards Rizhao</h3>
<p>Qingdao Liu's bandits have again invaded Wangtaizhen, Jiaozhou Zhucheng, and are attacking the city. The bandit suppression army is currently encircling from all sides, and there will be fierce fighting tonight. The Marine Corps stationed at Hongshiya telegraphed the city government on the morning of the 12th, stating that there are no traces of bandits there and that they have contacted the 86th Brigade of the provincial army and are taking extremely thorough precautions. According to Director Li of the Navy, Liu's bandits will definitely not flee east and throw themselves into a dead end. A small number of bandits claiming to be subordinates of Liu's troops have been discovered in Xiaozhushan and are being suppressed by the army. Lu Han has dispatched armored vehicles No. 1 and No. 2 from Taishan and Hubei to patrol Jiaozhou and Puxian day and night. Two trains of soldiers arrived at Huangqibao on the night of the 11th, and three trains arrived at Jiaozhou, immediately heading to the front line to pursue and suppress the bandits. Due to the congestion of troops, passenger and freight trains on the Jiaoji Railway are delayed. Ge Guangting and Peng Tubin returned to Qingdao together at 6:30 PM on the 12th. (Special dispatch on the 12th) Yesterday evening, Liu's bandits were fiercely attacked by Wu Yuanxing's regiment near Daqiao West, twenty miles east of Zhucheng, killing over sixty bandits, capturing over seventy guns, capturing over a hundred bandits, and seizing over a hundred horses and one mortar. The remaining bandits, less than three hundred, with less than two hundred horses, are desperately fleeing south. At 4 PM, they arrived in the Gaogezhuang Chaohe area, seventy miles south of the city, bordering Zhucheng and Rizhao, seemingly wanting to flee to the coastal area of Rizhao. The various brigades of Li Xiangju, Li Zhanbiao, and Tang Bangzhi, along with Wu Yuanxing's regiment, are in hot pursuit. The Navy has dispatched two patrol boats to cruise along the coast of Rizhao Shijiusuo and Jiaoxian Guzhenying. Two central government airplanes flew from Xuzhou to Weixian today and, guided by provincial army airplanes, dropped thirty-two-pound bombs six times on Chaohe, killing many bandits. The planes returned to Xuzhou. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Xuzhou Xu Kangliang and Jia Chao flew in aircraft No. 66 on the morning of the 12th, equipped with bombs, machine guns, etc., to Anqiu for reconnaissance. They did not find any traces of bandits and landed in Weixian. They met with the Shandong Air Force and took off from Weixian at noon. They discovered over a thousand cavalry of Liu's bandits between Taohuashan and Ma'ershan, Zhucheng and Rizhao, heading south. They immediately flew low and dropped six bombs, killing over a hundred bandits. The bandits fired machine guns at the aircraft, damaging the wings. Xu and Jia resumed firing machine guns, killing many bandits, before flying back to Xuzhou. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Xuzhou According to reports from air reconnaissance by the Third Military Region, the majority of Liu's bandit cavalry are being intercepted by the Shandong army from Weixian Anqiu. They are currently gathered between Zhucheng and Rizhao, heading south towards Juxian, and still have the potential to flee to Jiangsu. Wang Jun has ordered the troops stationed on the border to strictly prevent them from entering. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Xuzhou Military News: Liu's bandits fled to eastern Shandong. Han has dispatched Zhan's division to Jiaoxian to intercept them and ordered Mayor Shen to blockade all seaports near Hongshiya to prevent the bandits from fleeing to the coast, while still pursuing them.

<p>Qingdao A contingent of five or six hundred of Liu Guitang's bandits invaded Wangtai, seven or eight li southwest of Jiaozhou, opposite Qingdao. If they flee into Xiaozhushan, a nest of bandits, it will be difficult to suppress them. One brigade of Zhan Shutang's troops left Jiaozhou yesterday. Qingzhou has also dispatched 1,500 marines and public security officers, landing at Xuejiatou to cooperate in the operation. Furthermore, although Liu's bandits from Anqiu have advanced to Jingchai Town, south of Jiaozhou, railway operations are not in danger for the time being due to the serious alert along the Weixian-Gaomi line. However, rumors are rampant in Qingdao, and people's hearts are wavering. Mayor Shen Honglie is working hard to stabilize public sentiment. (Telegraph dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Qingdao Liu Guitang's bandit army has once again broken through the heavy encirclement of Han's army, escaping from Zhucheng on the 11th and pressing towards Anqiu, showing signs of heading north. Therefore, the battle lines are gradually approaching the Jiaoji Railway. As a result, Han's army is also moving troops towards Weixian, Gaomi, Jiaozhou, and other stations. In addition, the railway police team of the Railway Bureau has dispatched guards to Huangqibao and Zhushan stations to guard the railway. (Telegraph dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Order Gradually Returning to Tang Mine; 70% of Workers Have Resumed Work; Tao Shangming and Others Negotiating Aftermath</h3>
<p>Tianjin Seventy percent of the Tang Mine workers have resumed work today. Only a small number of out-of-town workers are hesitant to return to work immediately due to being misled by rumors that the mine will dismiss them. The Tangshan Public Security Bureau issued an announcement on the 11th, stating: "Upon investigation, it is regrettable that the miners were incited and blindly went on strike. The illegal labor union has been thoroughly resolved by this bureau. In addition to strictly arresting the main criminals, all good workers are urged to resume work immediately and not to waver, lest they cause themselves trouble." Today, the mine bureau has stipulated the order of the mine workers going to and from work, with entry and exit through one gate. The mine bureau and the police will jointly conduct inspections. Ma Deliang, the ringleader of the Tang Mine strike, was captured by the Public Security Bureau in Wangxiezhuang on the 11th. Nine people, including Zhang Zhenfu, Shi Yuzhu, and Shi Kuaiyuan, were sent to Tianjin early on the 12th to be escorted to the provincial government for interrogation. The Yuyu District Labor-Capital Affairs Supervisory Office was established on the 11th and attached to the Yuyu District Commissioner's Office. Tao Shangming convened a meeting with Zhao Xun, Li Yinchun, and Tangshan merchants and gentry on the evening of the 11th to discuss the resolution of the mine strike and the aftermath. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Nanjing Zhang Baoshi, the mining supervisor, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 12th and visited Kong Xiangxi and Chen Gongbo to report on the handling of the mine strike. The issue has now been resolved, and work has resumed as usual. However, out-of-town workers are still somewhat hesitant, but this is no longer a problem. There are a total of over 50,000 Kailuan workers, with a slightly larger number of out-of-town workers. There have been two mine strikes, one in December of last year. At that time, I was in Tianjin and explained the advantages and disadvantages, and the strike was quickly quelled. Neither strike was initiated by the workers themselves but was incited by local hooligans. The background of the hooligans was to create local unrest in order to achieve the manipulative aims of a small number of people. Therefore, due to the serious situation this time, after requesting instructions from Chairman Chiang through Chairman Lin, it was decided to strictly prohibit the strike, and it was eventually quelled. As for the company's treatment, it has always been extremely generous. All facilities, such as schools and hospitals, are designed for the workers' benefit. However, it has been too lenient, making it easy for unscrupulous elements to infiltrate and incite. In the future, restrictions will be increased. The workers' labor union will still be allowed to exist. The company's situation was best in the years 1927 and 1928, with a daily coal output of 10,000 tons. However, last year, it was greatly reduced due to the domestic economic downturn. Compared with previous years, there was a difference of three-tenths. The situation this year is still difficult to predict, but due to the sluggishness of industry and commerce, it is feared that there will be no improvement. As for the mining tax, 5% is levied, and the total amount can be paid for the sake of national tax revenue. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3>Central Government Holds Commemoration of Party Purification; Chen Lifu Reports on the Meaning and Mission of Party Purification</h3>
<p>Commemorative Meetings Held Separately in Various Places</p>
<p>Nanjing The Central Government held a commemoration meeting for the 7th anniversary of the Party Purification Movement at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 12th. Central Committee members Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Liu Shouzhong, Ma Chaojun, Li Zonghuang, Deng Jiayan, Fang Juehui, Chu Minyi, Li Ciwen, Xiao Jishan, Zhou Zuomin, Gu Zhenggang, Fan Yusui, Fu Rulin, Ke Xing'e, representatives of various agencies, and staff members of the departments, totaling more than 600 people, attended. Ju Zheng presided, and Chen Lifu gave a report, stating that the Party Purification Movement in 1927 had a great impact on the entire revolution. In those years, Premier Sun, based on physiological theories, advocated for the admission of communists, with the aim of supplementing and stimulating the party's organization. However, after the communists joined the party, they attempted to divide the party's strength and confuse the central thinking of our comrades. Therefore, we had the Party Purification Movement in 1927. At that time, the situation was difficult, and everyone was able to unite in sincerity and fight desperately against the communists, forcibly driving them out and uniting our ranks to work together. In particular, Mr. Dai Jitao's book "Philosophical Foundation of the Three Principles of the People" corrected the erroneous thinking at the time and enabled comrades to truly understand the principles. His contribution was especially great. The Party Purification Movement in 1927 was only a formal success, restoring the party's life, but there is still much active work to be done in the future to ensure correct thinking, strong organization, and further cleanse communist ideology from the Chinese nation, ensuring that our country's inherent virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, peace, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are restored, and then we can enhance the strength of our party, which is to increase the self-strengthening power of the Chinese nation. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 AM after the speech. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3>Rogers' Visit to China and the Silver Question - An English Perspective</h3>
<p>Mr. Rogers, dispatched by U.S. President Roosevelt to China as a special envoy to investigate the Far Eastern market and the silver situation, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and proceeded to Nanjing to meet with important figures from the government and the public. According to newspaper reports, his mission is purely advisory and will not involve any negotiations. While this has not been confirmed, it seems largely to be the case. However, given the very close relationship between the silver issue and our nation's economy, we cannot refrain from offering Mr. Rogers our views on the path our nation should strive to take, now that this special envoy from the Washington government has crossed vast oceans and graciously arrived to address this issue.</p>
<p>We surmise that Mr. Rogers' purpose in coming to China is primarily to develop American commerce, and that seeking a solution to the silver problem is merely one aspect of his method of promoting commerce. This cannot be compared to the significance that the silver problem holds for our nation. Consider that since the United States abandoned the gold standard last April, it has been devaluing the dollar and hoarding gold. All that its authorities have been scheming day and night is to exchange the low exchange rate for the expansion of overseas markets, leading to fierce competition with industrial exporting nations such as Britain and Japan. This is what the world calls the Anglo-American-Japanese exchange rate war. Under this fundamental policy, the United States seeks to penetrate countries in the Far East that generally use silver, so that the exchange rate of the dollar against silver-using countries also experiences a similar decline. This would make it possible for the United States to expand its commerce in the Far East. From the perspective of the United States, whether they are silver advocates or not, they share this fundamental concept, which is well known. This concept has been vigorously promoted by silver advocates, leading to the drafting of the London Silver Agreement last year and the recent proposal of various silver bills. The main point is becoming increasingly clear. Although Mr. Rogers' mission to China, under the order of the U.S. government, may not originate from the advocacy of silver proponents, it can be asserted that he cannot exceed the U.S. national interest in his interpretation of the silver issue.</p>
<p>If Mr. Rogers' mission is indeed only to expand his country's commerce, then Mr. Rogers must first have a deep understanding of the strength of our people's purchasing power for American goods. The strength of a nation's purchasing power does not fluctuate significantly with changes in the price of silver. A drop in the price of silver may not necessarily prevent the inflow of American goods, and a rise in the price of silver may not necessarily boost the sales of American goods. This can be clearly proven by consulting the customs statistics of previous years. If the United States truly wishes to open up its market and increase our purchasing power, the only way is to increase the value and quantity of our exported goods, so that trade can be closer. Furthermore, it is necessary to enable our country to embark on independent and free construction, so that production can expand and markets can develop. This is what we hope Mr. Rogers can share. If one only knows how to vacillate between the cheapness and dearness of the price of silver, as the American silver advocates do, then this is not a fundamental argument, and it is far from the way to promote international business relations.</p>
<p>Amidst Friendly Sentiments Between Japan and the U.S.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Reveals Japan's Scheme Against the U.S.: Attempting to Seize Alaska and Establish Naval and Air Force Bases - Using Fishing as a Smokescreen</h3>
<p>Washington D.C. Today, U.S. Senator Schoreviac revealed Japan's secret plan to wage war against the United States in the House of Representatives, shocking the House. At this time, politicians and businessmen from both Japan and the United States in New York are mutually celebrating the honor of the two countries, showing the joy of the Boles Festival, while Mr. Schoreviac retrieved the bones of the U.S.-Japan war from the diplomatic archives and made them clang in the House of Representatives. Mr. Schoreviac's discovery mainly originated in Moscow. According to Mr. Schoreviac, when he was in Soviet Russia last autumn, Soviet officials showed him secret documents and explained in detail the credible plan adopted by the Japanese military in the event of a U.S.-Japan war. According to Mr. Schoreviac, the secret documents specified that Japan's strategy included the following main points:</p>
<p>(1) Occupying the Aleutian Islands and Alaska; (2) Establishing naval, air force, and submarine bases along the coast of Alaska; (3) Destroying the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>Mr. Schoreviac said that the content of the secret documents was detailed and exhaustive. Other parts of the plan propose to use sharks produced in Alaska to feed millions of Japanese people. The plan is to organize a fleet (of 1,500 tons) of ships in the near future to establish many surface canning factories. Canning sharks is merely a strategy for the Japanese to confuse the world. The real purpose of establishing many surface canning factories, as stated in the secret documents, is to survey the North Pacific Ocean and the coast of Alaska. Mr. Schoreviac did not explain how the Soviet Union obtained the secret documents. Mr. Schoreviac added that, judging from the above information, the launch of the plan was around the time Congress allocated funds to build a naval base in Alaska. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington D.C. The House Merchant Marine Committee is studying a bill to place the supervision of the Alaskan fishing industry under the Alaskan Legislative Assembly. During the discussion, New York Representative Sirovic expressed his opinion that during his trip to Soviet Russia last summer, he saw various maps and plans indicating Japan's ambition for Alaska. The U.S. government neglects Alaska and does not defend it. Taking advantage of the U.S.'s negligence, Japan is planning to establish a base in southern Alaska. Once a war breaks out, the Japanese army and navy can seize the area. The maps and plans he saw detailed the method of invasion. Although the United States and Japan are unlikely to go to war immediately, the United States should build fortresses in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands in the southwest to provide defense. The representative also said that Russian military officers had shown various maps, designating the entire Siberian Philippine Islands and other eastern regions as land that should belong to Japan in the future. Japanese schools tell children that these places should legally belong to Japan, so Japan has the need to acquire them. (Havas Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Friendly Sentiments Amidst the Anniversary of the U.S.-Japan Treaty</h3>
<p>New York Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Hiroshi Saito stated today at a banquet celebrating the 80th anniversary of the first U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty in 1854 that the U.S. and Japan have a shared mission to maintain peace in the Far East. The two main points of this treaty are friendship and commerce. This is the essence of U.S.-Japan friendship. Therefore, people can laugh at the arguments of those who advocate a U.S.-Japan war. Saito also said that the exchange of goods between the U.S. and Japan has exceeded the greatest expectations of those who signed the treaty in those days. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington D.C. Eighty years ago, in 1854, U.S. Commodore Perry and the Japanese government first concluded the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Peace and Amity. The date of the signing was March 31. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce requested the State Department to designate this day as the anniversary of the treaty between the two countries every year and hold celebrations. Secretary of State Hull has approved this. This year's commemoration was held today. Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Saito delivered a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, stating, "The United States and Japan should cooperate jointly with other brotherly countries to seek peace and friendship, not only in the Pacific region, but also throughout the world. The history of relations between the U.S. and Japan is very deep, so we can only laugh at those who say that there is a risk of war between the two countries." The Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Bureau of the State Department, Humberick, said that the success of Japanese commerce is due to the effective cooperation of the entire nation, which the West should emulate.

<h3>Japanese Naval Grand Maneuvers in the Pacific - Continuing for Five Days from the 14th - Over Two Hundred Participating Ships</h3>
<p>Tokyo The 74 ships of the Japanese Combined Fleet, under the command of Admiral Uesugi, have been conducting exercises in the Pacific Ocean between Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and the Ryukyu Islands since last month, for more than a month. They have stopped today and the ships are returning to the main ports in Kyushu. They plan to sail to Amami Oshima (a Japanese island in the Pacific Ocean) in the coming days. From the 14th to the 18th, they will conduct joint maneuvers of the First and Second Fleets in the waters near the island. More than two hundred ships will participate in this grand exercise, along with dozens of aircraft. (China United Press Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo The committee investigating the cause of the loss of the torpedo boat Tomozuru announced on March 5 that the cause of the accident was insufficient "righting moment." Therefore, the naval authorities decided to remodel the four torpedo boats Chidori, Manazuru, Hatsukari, and Tomozuru, which were completed in the First Naval Replenishment Plan. The sixteen torpedo boats of the Second Replenishment Plan, which have been started or are about to be started, will also have their designs changed. A design change investigation committee was organized a few days ago. Military Councilor General Kato was appointed as the chairman, and the Deputy Chief of the Naval General Staff, the Minister of the Ship Administration Department, Mizuno, the Director of the Hydrographic Department, Ii, and the President of the Naval Academy, Shanghai, and other experts were appointed as members. The first meeting was held on the 6th. At this time of international tension, the Japanese naval authorities are remodeling their shipbuilding plans, causing great panic, and they will pursue the responsibility of the designers of the torpedo boats and impose penalties.

<h3>Where Will the Funds for Shipbuilding Come From If the U.S. Budget Is Not Approved?</h3>
<p>Washington D.C. Secretary of the Navy Swanson declared today that the Navy is now awaiting the outcome of the financial budget before submitting a request to allocate funds for the reconstruction of new ships. According to this most advantageous naval plan, it has previously been approved by Congress. The resolution advocates rebuilding 102 new ships according to the Naval Limitation Treaty of 1922, so that the U.S. Navy can be fully developed. Swanson also said that we will inspect each ship and rebuild the old ones, because repairing an old ship is sometimes more costly than building a new one. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Steps Taken by the U.S. for the Independence of the Philippines Within Ten Years - First Withdraw Naval Bases - Philippine Volunteer Army Assumes National Defense - Constitution to Be Formulated Within Two Years</h3>
<p>Washington D.C. The issue of the independence of the Philippine Islands has been planned during the term of President Roosevelt. Today, Senator Tydings announced the matter (Senator Tydings is the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Colonial Affairs). Tydings said that the first step to complete this goal is to withdraw troops from the eight garrison areas in the Philippines and reduce U.S. naval activity there. Olongapo, which is fifty miles north of Manila, was originally a U.S. naval base. Whether it will be abandoned in the future, according to naval officers, the Asiatic Fleet stationed in the Philippines and China must be abolished. The current number of U.S. troops stationed in the Philippines is 553 officers, 51 senior and general officers, 4,064 enlisted regulars, 62 officers, and 6,398 Philippine enlisted volunteers. The above officers and soldiers are assigned to eight main garrison areas, including an air force unit, a military hospital, and a regiment of coastal defense batteries. Regarding the withdrawal of the U.S. Army and Navy, the Philippine Volunteer Army will continue to be managed by the Philippine government and will serve as the national defense force. Most of its main officers will still be Americans for the time being. The U.S. government will soon hold a meeting with the Philippine government authorities to discuss transportation taxes and other necessary matters. The Philippine legislature plans to convene a treaty conference in Manila before October 1 this year to formulate the constitution of the Philippine Islands. The constitution must be approved by President Roosevelt within two years. After approval, the Philippine nation can be established, and the transfer procedures will be carried out within ten years. Political circles in Washington D.C. declared that they hope that the necessary steps will be carried out early in accordance with the overall plan. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Commercial Negotiations</h3>
<p>London According to reliable sources, Britain and Japan are currently negotiating to resolve their commercial disputes. Britain suggests that Japan limit its textile exports to a certain limit, or to the limit of 1931, and Britain will reciprocate by no longer boycotting Japanese goods. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Franco-Japanese Debt Dispute - Exchange Rate Difference Causes France to Suffer Losses - Old Case from Seven Years Ago Re-raised</h3>
<p>Paris The city of Tokyo, Japan, raised a foreign debt of £9.17 million in 1912, of which £4 million was raised in France. More than twenty years later, the exchange rate difference between Japanese and French currencies is very large. If the repayment is calculated at today's pound price, Tokyo City can make a profit of 300,000 yen, while French creditors will suffer huge losses. Therefore, seven years ago, French creditors sued the court, demanding that Tokyo City pay in gold francs. However, Tokyo City refused to comply. This matter has been entangled for many years and has been valued by French creditors. Recently, a group here that supports French interests in the Far East, called the French Colonial Problem Research Association, chaired by former Governor of Cochinchina Maspero, took the opportunity of receiving the new Governor of French Vietnam, Robin, to ask former Brazilian Ambassador Conte to make a report on the aforementioned debt case and review it. Maspero said, "The city of Tokyo is currently repaying its previous debts and paying interest in British pounds, U.S. dollars, and francs. However, the franc exchange rate is very different from before. The current market price of one franc is only a quarter of the former gold franc, which is a great loss for French creditors. Previously, the French court ruled that Tokyo City should repay the debt in gold francs, but it had no power to enforce it. This is the crux of the case. Currently, there seems to be no other remedy than diplomatic consultation and negotiation. However, diplomatic negotiations will inevitably lead to bargaining between the two countries. What we hope is that the interests of the colonies will not be used as an exchange in this debt negotiation." (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>

<h3>The Little Entente Is About to Recognize Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Romanian Foreign Minister Meets with Russian Representative</p>
<p>Geneva The negotiations on the recognition of Soviet Russia by the Little Entente (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania) seem to be progressing smoothly. It is expected that an agreement can be reached when Romanian Foreign Minister Doulou will visit Paris. Currently, the Romanian Foreign Minister is still in Geneva. The key to the failure of the Soviet Union and Romania to reach an understanding lies in the Bessarabia issue. However, when Romania and the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression treaty in London last autumn, this gap no longer existed. The purpose of the Romanian Foreign Minister's visit to Geneva this time is to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, but Litvinov's doctor has now prohibited him from coming here. Mr. Stahe, who represents Litvinov at the Main Department of the Disarmament Conference, visited the Romanian Foreign Minister today and conveyed Litvinov's apology for not being able to come to Geneva.

<h3>Polish-Czech Dispute - Still No Solution</h3>
<p>Capital of Czechoslovakia The dispute between the Czech Republic and Poland over the territorial rights of the West Silesia province and the city of West Sierke has not been resolved for a long time. The two countries are still trying to resolve it through diplomatic channels. The Czech government has proposed arbitration, but the Polish government has rejected this proposal. However, the general public is hoping that Poland will change to a more moderate attitude and withdraw its order to expel twenty-one Czech expatriates from Poland. It is also reported that a number of Polish athletes were originally scheduled to go to the Czech capital next Sunday to participate in a football match between Poland and the Czech Republic, but the Polish Foreign Minister has refused to issue passports. Therefore, the football match between the two countries cannot be held, and the Czech football team, because Poland has abandoned the match, can win the World Football Championship without competition.

<h3>The Eastern Section of the Chinese Eastern Railway Is Gradually Building a Longitudinal Railway - Contains Military and Political Significance - Clearly Conflicts with the Interests of the Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Changchun The eastern part of Liaoning and Jilin provinces is rich in mineral resources, especially gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and coal produced in Kuandian, Huanren, Jian, Tonghua, Liuhe, and other counties. Japanese capitalists have long coveted this,</p>
<p>but because of inconvenient transportation, it is not easy to develop. They had previously suggested to the Kwantung Army Special Service Department to build more railways in the eastern part of the two provinces. The department believed that there was also a military and political necessity, so it began to investigate and survey various places. This work has recently been completed and a plan has been formulated to build a railway from Andong that runs longitudinally through Liaoning and directly reaches Dunhua or Longjing Village on the Jihui Road, named the "Eastern Border Road Longitudinal Railway." At a time when Japanese-Russian relations are tense and the activities of the Eastern Righteous Army in Liaoning and Jilin are fierce, its intention can be measured, and Japanese capitalists are also carrying out their ambition to seize our mineral resources. (China United Press Agency Communication)</p>
<p>Bo Li The eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, from Hailin to Mudanjiang, is being supervised by the South Manchuria Railway Company to carry out construction projects. The work area is close to the tracks of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Houses are currently being built, building materials are being transported, and excavation work is being carried out. This new railway runs from Tumen through Ningguta, Sanxing (i.e., Yilan), to Fujin, directly pointing to Bo Li, and crosses the Chinese Eastern Railway. Its construction is guided by Japanese. The road will pass through the tracks of the Chinese Eastern Railway. This project in the Chinese Eastern Railway area clearly conflicts with the interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway and is being carried out without prior consultation with the Chinese Eastern Railway authorities. Rudi, the director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau, has submitted two reports to the board of directors, stating the illegal actions of the South Manchuria Railway personnel in the Chinese Eastern Railway area, and pointing out that digging soil near the Chinese Eastern Railway tracks poses a direct danger to the road, as the tracks are in danger of collapsing. Rudi further stated that although the administrative staff of the section had repeatedly notified the local railway police of the illegal actions of persons unrelated to the railway, the railway police had taken no steps whatsoever. Rudi solemnly declared that the South Manchuria Railway representatives were destroying the current regulations and urged the Chinese Eastern Railway board to take emergency measures against the rampant actions of the South Manchuria Railway.

<h3>Lin's Resignation as Minister of War is Firm - Attempts to Persuade Him Fail - Awaiting Final Decision from Prince Kan'in - Finding a Successor Proves Extremely Difficult - Rumors of Araki's Return Are Quite Strong</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Minister of War Lin stated today that he will resign from his position as Minister of War and will simultaneously relinquish his current position as General of the Army. (Jiji Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Minister of War Lin's determination to resign is very firm. He has rejected attempts at persuasion from various quarters, expressing his resolve. Last night, Minister of War Lin, Director-General of Military Education Masaki, Military Councilor Araki, and Vice Minister Yanagawa gathered at the Ministry of War to discuss the issue of a successor. As a result, it was decided to send Vice Minister Yanagawa to pay his respects to Prince Kan'in, the Chief of the General Staff, who is currently attending the Japanese Red Cross Society conference in Tokushima, to inquire about his intentions. A final decision will be made after the Vice Minister returns to Tokyo. It is expected that Prince Kan'in will return to Tokyo on the 16th, but it is also possible that he will return earlier on the 14th. Director-General of Military Education Masaki and Vice Minister Yanagawa are considered the most likely candidates to succeed Minister of War Lin. (Dentsu dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Since the 11th, Prime Minister Saito has repeatedly exerted effort to persuade Minister of War Lin to remain in his post, but to no avail. Consequently, at 3 PM on the 12th, he convened a meeting of the three elder statesmen cabinet members. The Prime Minister reported on the efforts to persuade Lin to stay and discussed the following measures: (1) Although Minister of War Lin's determination to resign is very firm, he possesses immense credibility and popularity within the Army. Considering the need for control within the military, it is appropriate to earnestly request that he remain in his post. (2) However, the government, considering the current circumstances, cannot follow the precedent set by Justice Minister Oyama at the time and request the return of the resignation. Instead, it will await a consensus of opinion within the military. (3) Regarding the military's opinion, since the Chief of the General Staff is still traveling, a decision will be made after his return to Tokyo. The government will patiently await a consensus of opinion between the military and the three elder statesmen cabinet members before taking appropriate action. (4) After the Chief of the General Staff returns to Tokyo, if the military approves Minister of War Lin's resignation and recommends a successor, then appropriate action will be taken. (5) Due to the above circumstances, all procedures will be halted until the Chief of the General Staff returns to Tokyo and the military reaches a decision. (Jiji Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Minister of War Lin's determination to resign is firm, but public opinion generally favors him remaining in his post. If Prime Minister Saito's report to the Emperor and the subsequent proceedings acknowledge that it is most appropriate for him to stay, then Minister of War Lin may withdraw his resignation. This matter was only clarified this morning. However, if the Prime Minister were to present a special imperial decree as was done in the case of former Justice Minister Oyama, the responsibility would be significant, making it inappropriate. Therefore, it has been decided not to proceed in this manner. The matter is largely considered an issue between the Prime Minister and Minister of War Lin, and it is natural to adopt an appropriate course of action. It is possible that the Prime Minister will withdraw the resignation before formally reporting it to the Emperor using appropriate methods. In any case, the final decision on whether he resigns or remains in his post will be made after Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in returns to Tokyo on the 14th. (Dentsu dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Lin Senjuro's determination to resign is firm, so the military authorities have no choice but to consider a successor. However, since Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in is currently traveling in the Kochi Prefecture area, the Ministry of War plans to send someone to solicit Prince Kan'in's opinion. While Director-General of Military Education Masaki Jinzaburo is the most talked-about candidate to succeed him as Minister of War, there is also considerable support for General Araki's reappointment. (Jiji Press dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - If Minister of War Lin definitively resigns and it proves difficult to reverse, then the issue of his successor will be extremely important. It is currently being considered by various parties to select from among Director-General of Military Education Masaki, General Araki, Vice Chief of Staff Ueda, Vice Minister Yanagawa, and others. However, due to the extraordinarily complex internal situation and the differing opinions of various parties, it is proving very difficult to find a suitable successor. Although Masaki has been nominated as the leading candidate, that general, by nature, does not wish to stand in the spotlight, and there are also many who oppose him. As for Nami, Araki, Abe, and others, although there are those who recommend them, various obstacles have arisen due to the internal situation, making it seem unlikely that they will be appointed. Only Vice Chief of Staff Ueda or Commander of the 4th Division Terauchi appear to have no difficulty in assuming the post of Minister of War. Considering the general situation, the final decision on this list of candidates will only be made after seeking the opinion of Chief of the General Staff Field Marshal Prince Kan'in.

It states that the American people are determined to continuously pursue policies based on the development of democracy.

Although it may seem revolutionary, this new policy contains absolutely no elements of fascism or communism because it does not aim to completely eliminate any class or private property.

<h3>U.S. Tariff Policy is Key to Economic Survival - Trade Agreement Negotiations Cannot Proceed Until War Debts are Resolved</h3>
<p>Washington - Government officials stated today that if the issue of reducing war debts cannot be resolved soon, it will inevitably affect the negotiations for reciprocal trade agreements. Congress remains firmly opposed to reducing war debts, and reports from European countries indicate that enthusiasm for the proposed trade agreements is waning. According to the tariff bill currently under consideration by Congress, President Roosevelt has the power to conclude such trade agreements. According to an official announcement today, the President's request for the authority to negotiate tariffs is a key measure to resist the rising tide of nationalism and represents a compromise between America's "policy of isolation" and its "expansive tariff policy." According to the confidential advisors of Roosevelt, the "expansive tariff policy" is the second method for economic survival. From an international perspective, this measure is a rejection of the extreme nationalism that the United States seemed to adopt at the London Conference. At the London Conference, the United States rejected the steps towards stability and unity through international cooperation. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace publicly stated that the United States must make a final decision to clarify whether it leans towards nationalism or internationalism. If the path of nationalism is chosen, the United States must abandon plans to develop 100 million acres of additional farmland because no foreign market can absorb such a huge amount of agricultural products. As a result, one-third of the farmland will remain idle, and farmers will face large-scale displacement. Agriculture, being most susceptible to the impact of export trade, will be sacrificed by this plan. Furthermore, the interest on foreign war debts owed to the United States amounts to approximately $1 billion annually. If other countries are to repay these debts, there will be no foreign trade to speak of. Therefore, the second option is to reduce tariff barriers so that other countries can purchase agricultural products and repay their debts with goods. Washington estimates that this measure will involve the United States accepting foreign goods worth $1 billion annually. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Brain Trust Red Scare Turns into a Farce</h3>
<p>Washington - The case of the President's Brain Trust being Red has completely turned into a farce in Washington political circles today. Some members of Congress are still expressing concern over this matter, while optimistic members are treating it as a joke. The chairman of the House Investigating Committee said that Professor William Wirt, who raised the case, was imprisoned during the Great War (due to pro-German sentiments). Wirt denied this. Congressman Fulmer said that Professor Wirt is a tool of Wall Street, seeking to create a National Socialist dictatorship in the United States. Newspapers across the country say that Professor Wirt's motives are purely sensationalistic and do not warrant our anger or concern. At the same time, the Investigating Committee has issued a notice and scheduled a meeting for next Tuesday to question all the guests who attended the banquet and then notify the public. The committee insists that it will not immediately determine responsibility for this matter to avoid the opposition party using it as fodder in the next election. At the same time, Eleanor Roosevelt also issued a statement refuting Professor Wirt, as some of the women he accused of being Red were prominent figures. (Hua Guomin News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - Professor Wirt yesterday provided the names of two people who allegedly made statements advocating the overthrow of the existing U.S. Constitution. These two people declared that they had not made these statements. The Congressional Investigating Committee determined that it was no longer necessary to continue to exist and decided to disband. When Professor Wirt appeared in court for the second time today, the committee instructed him to return home at his own expense. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Mark Devaluation Issue - Rumors of Resignation by President of the Deutsche Bank</h3>
<p>Berlin - Today, rumors spread in German banking circles that Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank, had resigned.

It is said that Chancellor Hitler did not accept Schacht's resignation because he, like Schacht, does not favor Mark devaluation. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

However, Müller will now appeal to a higher court. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Numerous Hidden Reefs in the Path of Sino-British Trade Agreement Negotiations</h3>
<p>Nanjing - A diplomatic source stated that after the Opium War, the Treaty of Nanking was signed with the British in the 22nd year of the Daoguang Emperor's reign (1842). The following year, the Supplementary Treaty of the Bogue was signed between China and Britain, and consular jurisdiction was introduced at this time, laying the groundwork for future harm. In the 8th year of the Xianfeng Emperor's reign (1858), the Treaty of Tientsin allowed British ships to freely enter and exit the Hankou area of Hubei Province, causing domestic commerce to decline sharply. Today, if our country wishes to prosper economically, the renegotiation of trade agreements is a prerequisite. Although our side has proposed this to the British government several times, the British side, using the excuse of international repercussions, has not yet made a substantial commitment. As for other countries, due to their own interests, they are reluctant to discuss revisions. Due to this delay, it is difficult to achieve a result in the short term. Rumors of ongoing negotiations are premature. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Wang Pingzheng Discusses Fundamental Solutions to the Yellow River Problem</h3>
<p>Nanjing - Supervisory Committee member Wang Pingzheng, who oversaw the Yellow River damming project, has returned to Beijing. According to him, the damming project on the south bank has been completed. Of the 32 breaches on the north bank, only seven remained in Shitouzhuan, Hebei Province, before he departed for Beijing. They should now be completed as well. The next step is to rebuild the secondary dikes to provide protection. The fundamental solution to the Yellow River problem lies in concentrating the water flow to scour away the silt. The riverbed is mostly sand and mud, and the outlets are mostly deltas. This causes the water flow to carry silt, so it is necessary to remove the deltas and scour away the silt. Wang also recounted an amusing story: When the water rises in the affected areas, the people climb tall trees, and when the water rises to the tops of the trees, the refugees have no choice but to jump down, thinking they will surely die. But when they enter the water, they still stand upright because the ground beneath is all sand and mud. This proves that the solution to the Yellow River problem is to scour away the silt.

<h3>Dai Chuanxian Telegraphed Requesting Strict Prohibition of Tomb Raiding</h3>
<p>Xi'an - Dai Chuanxian telegraphed on the 11th to preserve antiquities: "To Director Cai of the Academia Sinica in Shanghai, Director Wang in Nanjing, and Chairman Chiang in Jiangxi: Recently, scholars of Sinology and science have suddenly started a trend of excavating ancient tombs to find academic materials. In academic circles, this is often seen as a matter of course, but patriotic citizens are heartbroken, crying out without a voice, weeping without tears. China is extremely poor today, and scholarship and education are extremely dilapidated. There are countless things that should be done. Why excavate tombs and then pursue scholarship? Public morality is at its lowest point today. If this mentality does not change, destruction awaits. Tomb raiding is clearly strictly prohibited by criminal law. In ancient times, those who dug up their ancestral tombs were subjected to death by a thousand cuts. Today, some provinces also punish it with the death penalty. What is the mindset of you gentlemen to dig up the tombs of the ancients, whom the entire nation should love and respect, thereby harming the virtue of your ancestors, corrupting the conduct of your compatriots, and leading future generations in an improper direction? Our Premier Sun Yat-sen championed nationalism and based it on cultivating public morality. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, amidst great hardship and toil, knows that saving the nation requires cultivating public morality. Do the actions and intentions of you experts align with this path? Private digging of small, nameless tombs is punished with imprisonment of five years, while public digging is openly protected by national law, the result of which is to promote prejudice that destroys national history and damages the national spirit. Is this the path that our National Government should take? I implore you to issue an order to the entire country that anyone who publicly digs up tombs and takes items, regardless of the reason, will be severely punished according to the special provisions of the criminal law, so that public morality can be rectified and popular grievances can be appeased. At the same time, I urge you gentlemen to change your unprofitable behavior and useless mindset, and to devote yourselves to the study of saving the nation and the people, so as to strengthen the national foundation and national power. I sincerely pray, Dai Chuanxian." (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>New York The rubber market today (12th) was active and strong due to better telegrams from London and the news that a restriction agreement has been drafted and will be announced by the end of this week.

<h3>Japanese Puppets Organize Cotton Company in Northeast China</h3>
<p>Resisting Foreign Cotton Imports into Northeast China</p>
<p>Monopolizing China's Cotton Market</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: In order to resist foreign cotton imports into Northeast China and monopolize China's cotton yarn market, Japan has recently instigated the establishment of the Manchurian Cotton Co., Ltd. by the puppet organization. The puppet Ministry of Industry created a decree, which was submitted to and passed by the puppet State Council on the 26th of last month. The head office has now been formally established in Liaoning, and branch offices are being established in various important areas. They are actively working to improve seeds and cultivation methods and are vigorously promoting the benefits of cotton planting, hoping to increase production from the original 30 million catties to 80 million catties within ten years. The company also claims that if the cultivation guidance is successful in the first year, the planned production amount can be exceeded after ten years. The intentions and organizational methods of establishing this company are disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>Resisting Foreign Cotton Imports into Northeast China</p>
<p>The cotton produced in Northeast China is in short supply due to poor seeds and outdated cultivation methods. Japan's cotton production is also not surplus, and it needs to rely on foreign cotton imports to make up the difference. The amount of this shortfall is enormous. The Japanese, in view of this, have established this company. In the future, foreign cotton imports into Northeast China will inevitably be hit hard.</p>
<p>Monopolizing China's Cotton Yarn Market</p>
<p>Japan takes advantage of China's inability to control its own tariffs to facilitate transportation and sales to China, monopolizing China's market. It has also established yarn factories in major cities in the interior of China to destroy China's yarn factories, causing them to frequently go bankrupt. Recently, it has intensified its efforts, hoping to transport as much cotton as possible from Northeast China to the interior in the future. The raw materials from Northeast China will be used for Japanese manufacturing, and then they will be dumped into our market. The tariffs can also be avoided. The depth of their intentions and the ruthlessness of their methods are unparalleled. Establishing Agencies to Purchase Cotton</p>
<p>In addition to guiding people to plant cotton and improving cotton seeds, the company also sets up purchasing offices and warehouses in various cotton-producing areas. At a fixed price, personnel are dispatched to purchase cotton at any time. The intention is nothing more than to ensure that farmers' harvests throughout the year are not left over, thereby increasing farmers' interest in planting cotton.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Organizational Law of the Cotton Company</p>
<p>The organizational law of the company consists of 29 articles. The important ones are listed below: 1) The government, in order to improve and increase domestic cotton production, has established the Manchurian Cotton Co., Ltd., which will purchase cotton produced in the area designated by the Minister of Industry. 2) The purpose of Manchurian Cotton Co., Ltd. is to manage the purchase and seed collection of domestically produced cotton. 3) The head office is located in Fengtian (Mukden), and purchasing offices can be established in necessary locations with the approval of the Minister of Industry. 4) The capital is 2 million yuan, of which the government contributes 1 million yuan. 5) The shares are registered and each share is 50 yuan. 6) The existence of Manchurian Cotton Co., Ltd. is from the date of establishment and registration until 20 years. After the expiration, it can be extended with the government's permission. 7) Manchurian Cotton Co., Ltd. has one chairman, four directors, and two supervisors. 8) The chairman, directors, and supervisors are all elected at the shareholders' meeting, but cannot take office without the government's permission. The term of office for the chairman and directors is four years, and for the supervisors, it is two years. 9) The company can distribute 6% interest annually to all shares except those owned by the government. However, no interest is distributed to the shares owned by the government. 10) The government should provide a subsidy of 100,000 yuan to the company each year for the 6% interest distributed by the company to other shares. Examining the above articles, the regulations stipulate that the puppet government contributes half of all the share capital, and the rest is raised from merchants. On the surface, it is a normal enterprise jointly run by officials and merchants. However, in reality, the puppet government is completely controlled by the Japanese, and the real power is still in the hands of the Japanese. The organization of this kind of company is just a new form of aggression, used to deceive the people of Northeast China with a sleight of hand.</p>

Upon hearing the news, the puppet authorities forced all shops to hang the Japanese and Manchurian flags and erected archways in important areas of the city to express their welcome. The military and police were dispatched, and security was unusually tight. The puppet garrison commander, traitor Zhang Wenzhu, and the puppet department heads all went to welcome him in person and chose Longjiang Hotel as Hishikari's temporary residence. In addition to attending welcome banquets from various important traitors, Hishikari, accompanied by his staff, departed from his residence at 9:40 AM on the 30th and inspected a certain cavalry unit under the command of a certain regiment subordinate to the garrison in Qiqihar, and after inspecting a certain infantry unit of Yishan, at 11:20 AM, he went to the provincial government office. Most of the traitors welcomed him in front of the door. After lunch, he ordered Japanese officials to gather together and gave them instructions. At 1:00 PM, he attended the joint welcome meeting of Japanese and Manchurian officials and civilians in Qiqihar. It can be seen that the Japanese in the puppet state are focused and tireless in order to achieve their goal of permanently ruling our lost territory in Northeast China. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Tang Coal Mine Strike Resolved; Zhao Dazhong Flees to Shanhaiguan to Evade Punishment; In-Shift Workers Have Resumed Work</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Tangshan coal mine strike, after many days of dispute, has finally been</p>
<p>generally resolved today. Zhao Dazhong, under the protection of a Japanese man named Nakamura, secretly fled to Shanhaiguan at 4:30 PM on the 9th. From noon on the 9th, the Battle Zone Security Team, in coordination with the Public Security Bureau police, maintained strict security in Tangshan City, searching for the instigators of the strike. The security was even tighter at night. Shi Yuzhu, a representative of the new labor union, has been arrested by the Public Security Bureau. Zhang Zhenfu, Ma Deliang, and Zhi Kuaiyuan have fled and are in hiding. The puppet Battle Zone Workers' Autonomous Joint General Labor Union and the Rickshaw Pullers' Labor Union established by Zhao Dazhong have been dissolved due to the lack of leadership. On the streets, anyone wearing a red armband identifying them as striking workers was arrested by the police. Therefore, in the afternoon, Tangshan City was no longer seen with workers wearing red armbands, carrying wooden sticks, demonstrating and running rampant. On the afternoon of the 9th, Tao Shangming, in the name of commissioner, issued a proclamation. The original text stated, "Proclamation: It has been investigated that the Tangshan coal mine strike was instigated and incited by reactionary elements such as Zhao Dazhong, with the intention of riot. It has now been ordered by the provincial government to strictly apprehend them. In addition to having already transferred orders for their arrest, all illegally organized Battle Zone Workers' Joint Autonomous General Labor Union and the Three New General Labor Union (referring to Qixin Cement Company, Qixin Porcelain Factory, and Huaxin Textile Factory)</p>
<p>and other branch organizations should be dissolved immediately. Anyone who resists will be arrested and severely punished according to the law. The old labor organizations should also temporarily cease activities during the period of handling the labor strike and await further verification. In addition to ordering the Commander of the Second Security General Team of the Battle Zone and the Director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau to comply and implement in coordination, and to protect good workers, this proclamation is hereby issued to all coal mine workers, who should be aware of this. You must all abide by the law, maintain your positions, work as usual, and must not be incited by others, bringing trouble upon yourselves. Be sure of this!" After the proclamation of the commissioner's office was posted, Zhao Dazhong, seeing the situation was urgent, moved the Battle Zone Workers' Autonomous Joint General Labor Union to the Japanese-organized Gonghe Hotel near the station. He convened a meeting of his followers, intending to start a riot. Upon hearing this, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched a large team to the hotel to surround and search it. Zhao heard the sound and fled first. In the afternoon, he disguised himself and was sent to Shanhaiguan by the Japanese. The police removed the wooden signs of various illegal organizations organized by Zhao Dazhong, such as the Battle Zone Workers' Autonomous Joint General Labor Union, the Large Cart Drivers' Labor Union, and the Rickshaw Pullers' Labor Union. The Tangshan striking workers, when changing shifts at 6 AM on the 9th, gathered in front of the mine bureau to demand unconditional permission to return to work. The British mine manager, fearing that the workers' sudden return to work might cause problems, coordinated with the mine area police to inspect them and allowed more than 500 out-of-shift workers to be bailed out and return to work. Most of the workers were instructed to wait for an official notice from the government regarding the resolution of the labor strike before being allowed to return to work. Therefore, the workers who were not immediately allowed to return to work dispersed with disappointment. After the commissioner's office proclamation was issued in the afternoon, the in-shift workers went to the mine to express their willingness to return to work at 1 AM on the 10th. The out-of-shift workers also planned to have the contractors conduct separate investigations and deliberate on who should stay and who should leave within three days, and then resume work. According to the person in charge of the mine, some people said that the mine bureau was too harsh in dealing with the striking workers. In fact, it was not. In order to thoroughly resolve the situation, the mine had to endure the pain for a while, hoping that the government would take measures. Otherwise, the workers would make many demands, and the consequences of allowing them now would be endless. As for how to deal with it in the future, it all depends on the government's measures. The mine bureau, from the standpoint of a business organization, is not in a position to make suggestions on political security. The reason why the labor strike was resolved this time was that Zixuezhong advocated for strict handling, and the military sub-committee paid attention to this matter. The section chief, Zhu Shiqin, went to Tangshan to negotiate with the Japanese, breaking through diplomatic relations, and then was able to boldly arrest Zhao Dazhong. Zhu Shiqin returned to Beijing on the early train on the 9th to report. Tao Shangming also sent the commissioner's office secretary, Zhu Yi, to Tianjin to visit Chairman Yu to report on the handling of the labor strike. Yu ordered Zhu to return to Tangshan on the afternoon of the same day, instructing Tao Shangming to continue handling the matter in accordance with the provincial orders, ensuring that the roots and branches were severed, and the consequences were cut off.

<h3>Chiang Orders Provinces to Unify Finances, Pay Attention to General Administration Construction, Reduce Fixed Project Funds</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang believes that provincial finances have recently become increasingly independent, leading to chaos. During the previous meeting of ten provincial administrative leaders, he personally instructed them to unify revenue and expenditure so that all administrative matters could proceed in an orderly manner. To implement this important policy, he specifically telegraphed from the headquarters to Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang-Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces to comply. The original order stated: "Provincial local finances are extremely important for promoting administrative education and construction in each province. If financial revenue and expenditure can be brought into order, all undertakings can be carried out step by step to achieve gradual progress. In the past, tax revenues in various provinces were mostly designated and allocated by the responsible agencies for their own disposal, resulting in independent administrations and increasing financial disorder. If the revenue of a province lacks unification, all politics will not only be impossible to advance but will also decline as a result. Thinking of this, I am deeply worried. It must be understood that whether the politics of a province can be carried out effectively depends on whether its financial revenue and expenditure can be unified. During the recent meeting in Jiangxi with provincial department heads and commissioners, a comprehensive review of various reports revealed that the financial situations of all provinces are complex and confused. Unless unity is actively promoted, it will be difficult to achieve perfect governance. I have already made this clear, hoping it can be realized. From now on, local finances in all provinces must be reorganized, and the method of unified revenue and expenditure must be strictly implemented. The expenses for various undertakings, unless absolutely necessary, should be kept to a minimum, so that judgments and balances can be made to prioritize projects for administrative construction. This will allow politics to be clarified and gradually improved. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued, instructing the provincial governments to comply immediately and report on the compliance status for record. This order." (Eleventh)</p>
<h3>Political and Military Situation in Kang and Tibet</h3>
<p>Yichang Dispatch: According to the Second Brigade Commander of the Sichuan-Kang Border Defense Army, Ming Xiang, who recently spoke to a reporter in detail about the situation in Kang, a detailed account is provided below.</p>
<p>Evolution of Internal Affairs: Tracing back to the end of the late Qing Dynasty, Zhao Bianli (E'rfeng) was entrusted with full authority to implement the change of the Tusi system to direct rule, but fearing interference from the rear, his brother Zhao Cishan (E'rxun) was ordered to supervise Sichuan to provide support. Sichuan's oil and sugar donations were specifically designated as border expenses, and one million taels of silver from the Jianghai and Jianghan customs were allocated as start-up funds. Special permission was granted to transfer outstanding officials from Sichuan and other provinces to serve in the border areas, with combined authority and ample financial resources and talent. The change to direct rule was implemented in a few years (the change to direct rule was approved in the thirty-second year of Guangxu, with a total of twenty administrative offices established on the border: He Kou, Li Tang, Dao Ba, Ding Xiang, De Rong, Yan Jing, Pa Jiang, Ka Zha Pu Sang Ang Za Yu on the southern route; Dao Fu, Ma Shi, De Ge, Tong Pu, Deng Ke, Shi Qu on the northern route; and Zhan Dui, Huang Gong, and Jue San Yan in the central route; in addition to the former Qing-controlled Li Tang, Ba Tang, Qamdo, San Niang Tai, and the furnaces in the northern route. Land belonging to the Khutuktu was also reclaimed, as the Qing court had granted it to Tibet. For each territory acquired, officials were appointed to investigate the population, assess grain taxes, stipulate corvée labor, repair roads, establish relay stations, and set up schools with utmost effort. Therefore, after the change to direct rule, the entire border region was well-managed and gradually became orderly. Soon after, the national system changed, and Tibetans invaded, causing the successive loss of He Kou, Li Tang, Dao Yu, Xiang Yu, De Rong, Zha Pu, Jiang Ka, Gong Jue, and other places. Qamdo was besieged, and the north and south were in disarray. Before the first year of the Republic, Inspector Yin (Changheng) led an army to the west and conquered He Kou and Li Tang in a few months, relieving the siege of Qamdo. Jiang Ka, Zha Pu, Gong Jue, De Rong, and others were successively conquered, and Zhenfu Prefectures were established, changing the original administrative offices to prefectures and counties. At that time, the Western Expeditionary Army's food was supplied by Sichuan, and the revenue from the border areas was used for the administration of the various counties in the border areas, with ample surplus. The salaries of the prefectures and counties were also subsidized from military expenses. In the third year of the Republic, the Zhenshou Shi was changed, dividing military and political expenses. Military expenses were entirely subsidized by Sichuan, while political expenses were covered by the annual income of the border areas. At that time, politics could still maintain the old scale of Zhao's administration. In the sixth year of the Republic, Envoy Chen Sunling was stationed on the border, and Tibetan bandits invaded, losing eleven counties in the north and south (Ning Jing, Tai Ya in the southern route; De Ge, Tong Pu, Deng Ke, Si Yuan, Qamdo, Shi Qu in the northern route; Wu Cheng, Yu Xian Feng in the central route). Moreover, Hui people occupied the area, and Xiang Dao De Rong, the entire border region's discipline was lost. Local chieftains gradually asserted themselves, and Yi bandits became increasingly tyrannical. In the spring of the fourteenth year, the Northern Government abolished the Zhenshou Shi and appointed Liu Chengxun as the Western Kang Reclamation</p>
<p>Envoy, and the regional politics remained the same as Envoy Chen's old system, lasting only two years, with little progress in politics. This is the general outline of Western Kang's past internal affairs. After the army took over Western Kang in the sixteenth year, a border affairs department was established in the military headquarters to handle the administrative affairs of Kang Ning (Western Kang and Ningyuan in southwestern Sichuan). In the seventeenth year, the Western Kang Political Affairs Committee was established to supervise Western Kang's administration. According to the border affairs plans, key projects were selected for implementation. At that time, various schools for academic and group affairs, as well as agricultural experiment fields and libraries, were being gradually constructed, and plans were being made to speed up progress. However, there were signs of internal turmoil in Sichuan, followed by the outbreak of the Great White War. It was not until the twenty-first year that war was waged against Tibet, recovering four counties east of the Jinsha River. Just as plans were being made to advance into Qamdo, the Sichuan War broke out, resulting in Western Kang's administrative affairs not being fully organized. Until last year (the twenty-second year), the army, in order to avoid the unnecessary sacrifices of internal war, devoted itself to the border affairs of Kang Ning, intending to actively and systematically reorganize the internal affairs of the Kang area. As mentioned above, Kang's politics were affected by the Sichuan situation and wars. From now on, the army will focus on national defense. As the saying goes, "To resist foreign aggression, one must first pacify the interior," which is a constant principle of governance. The corruption of Kang's politics and the decline of discipline in recent years have reached their extreme. It is essential to purify the bureaucracy, cultivate talent, reform civil administration, extend civil rights, appease the border people, and punish local tyrants, starting with the most urgent tasks, to gradually establish government prestige and bring the Kang people into order. These are all the sole policy directions for future internal affairs. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Cantonese Army Occupies Pangu Pass, Blockading Traffic in the Junmenling Bandit Area; Bandits Attempt Counterattack, Suffering a Major Defeat and Retreating</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: After the 78th Division of the Cantonese bandit suppression army implemented a cordon against the bandits in Luotang Junmenling, the Deng Hui and Chen Fengshao regiments attacked Panxia Pass on the first day. There were originally three or four hundred bandits in that area, but they were surrounded and quickly retreated back to Junmenling after a brief battle. The Deng Regiment completely occupied the pass at 2:00 p.m. that day, seizing a considerable amount of military supplies. From then on, the Cantonese army could block traffic in the Junmenling bandit area. On the second day, taking advantage of a heavy fog, the Red bandits attempted to attack the Pangu Pass and the Chenjiang Village defense line. The Ye and Huang regiments fought together to resist, and the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated again. In this battle, more than two hundred bandits were killed, and more than one hundred short guns, one machine gun, and one red flag were captured. The flag had the words "Fake Ruichang Third Guerrilla Brigade Command" on it. A fake commander and a company commander were killed. Currently, the Red bandits under Junmenling are still attempting to break out and counterattack, and the Red bandits in various places in Changting are launching simultaneous riots. Upon receiving this news, the Cantonese army ordered the troops stationed in various bandit areas to strictly blockade and guard. The Li Department of the Fifth Division is advancing from Pingyuan to the Jiangxi border.</p>
<p>Li Yangjing convened a meeting of various generals in Meixian on the second and third days, resolving to concurrently serve as the commander of the Second Column. Huang Renhuan has returned to Wuping Yongpingzhai area to inspect the Fujian-West defense line. The bandits in Changting and Liancheng planned to attack Gutian at the junction of Tinglong, but were defeated by the Chen Brigade of the Central Army. The Communist bandits in Dayangba Nanyang area of Shanghang are also retreating. The Central Army has dispatched teams to the Jiangjunshan area to ambush the remnants of the bandits. Zhang Dingcheng's bandits in Liancheng will soon retreat due to a lack of ammunition and food. (Sixth)</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Returns to Qingdao; Southern Trip Results Extremely Satisfactory</h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, who left Qingdao on March 1st for the west, then went to Hankou, Nanjing, and Nanchang to meet with Chairman Chiang, Deputy Commander Zhang, and President Wang to report on the city's construction and took the opportunity to visit Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and other places to observe industry, commerce, and rural conditions. After forty days, he returned to Qingdao this morning (the tenth) at 7:30 a.m. on the second train on the Jiaoji Railway. City Government Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng, along with the heads of various bureaus and offices, as well as important personnel from the Navy and Jiaoji Railway Bureau, were at the station to welcome him. After getting off the train, Shen exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel and then took a car to his residence to rest. He went to the City Government that day</p>
<p>to work. The reporter made a special visit to inquire about the trip. Shen said, "I left Qingdao on the first of last month, taking the Jiaoji Jinpu route to Longhai Pinghan, passing through Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Hankou, Wuchang, Nanchang, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and other places. It has been a month and ten days. In addition to meeting with Chairman Chiang, President Wang, and Deputy Commander Zhang to report on the situation in Qingdao and discussing Qingdao's industrial and commercial tax rates with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Transportation, I also took the opportunity to inspect the educational and economic conditions in various places. I have not been to the Yangtze River area for fifteen years, so I have seen many changes. 1. In Nanchang, I learned that the bandit suppression policy is to take a steady and solid approach, using blockhouses as bases. In military terms, it does not seek</p>
<p>luck, and in the recovered areas, it seeks to alleviate the people's livelihood to draw the fire from under the cauldron. Therefore, the Communist bandits in Jiangxi can be pacified this year. 2. In Hankou, I saw that Deputy Commander Zhang was very strong. He is now assisting Chairman Chiang in engaging in the bandit suppression work in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui to relieve the people's suffering and to fulfill his desire to serve the country to the best of his ability. 3. In Nanjing, I received very detailed guidance on policy from President Wang, and Minister Kong also took into consideration the suffering of the people in Shandong and Qingdao, exempting 60% of the export tax on local products and agreeing to exempt the transit tax on local products for three years. The match industry was also rescued. Other matters related to local areas were resolved satisfactorily. I deeply feel that local officials must consult with the central authorities more often, and the central authorities should also send key personnel to various provinces and cities for on-site inspections to facilitate communication and avoid any misunderstandings. Only then can all policies be implemented and achieve twice the results with half the effort. 4. In Shanghai, the focus was on inspecting the industry. I stayed in Shanghai for four days and visited many factories. Among them, the woolen mill, enamel factory, electrical appliance factory, textile printing and dyeing factory, canning factory, acid manufacturing factory, gas refining factory, and other factories run by Chinese people were the first I had seen. Their technological progress and the quality of their products truly shed light on domestic products. However, the number is too small, and they are affected by the dumping of foreign goods, so they are all seeking a way out in difficult circumstances. Also, the factories I saw this time were only developed in Shanghai and Wuxi.</p>
<p>According to the recent national factory unified tax calculation, the annual amount is about 90 million yuan, but the cigarette tax has already accounted for two-thirds, which is purely useless consumption. Of the remaining 30 million yuan, the textile industry accounts for the most, and factories run by foreigners in China account for a considerable portion. Based on this calculation, the decline of the national industry can be imagined. 5. This time, the inspections focused on education and economy. In terms of education, except for Shanghai, where I was too busy inspecting factories to visit each one, I visited most of the important large, medium, and small schools in other places. I paid special attention to vocational schools and social education. This time, the Shanghai Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Wuxi People's Education College, the Agricultural Science Department of Jinling University, and others all aim to deeply integrate into the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors, training middle and lower-level personnel to directly guide agriculture, industry, and commerce, enabling education to integrate with society. The students who graduate and work all have significant achievements in society, which is commendable. It is a pity that the scope is still small and may still be in the experimental stage, unable to be popularized everywhere. In terms of economy, the recent increase in imports and other reasons has led to rural bankruptcy and industrial and commercial decline. This time, I personally visited various places and witnessed the actual decline of agriculture, industry, and commerce, which proves that what I heard was not false. Shanghai and Wuxi are the centers of industry and commerce, and Nanchang is the hub of military affairs. Although the markets are more prosperous, there is a suspicion of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak. It seems that solving the problems of production, education, and agriculture, industry, and commerce still requires the power of a clear government to promote it. However, the personnel I saw in various provinces felt that the current political system was too complicated, such as a county magistrate who has more than a dozen chiefs, and all official documents consume a lot of time and money, leaving no time to do the work of loving the people and building the country. The same is true for upper-level agencies. It seems that this situation needs to be improved. Although the issue of autonomy has been handled in various places for a long time, it often focuses on formalities. This time, I heard that the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior Affairs have adopted a policy that the promotion of autonomy will have three steps, striving to suit the local conditions and achieve the goal of governance. The most recently established system also focuses on simplicity, such as taking the city and county as the unit of autonomy. In addition, there are many matters to visit that can be used as a reference for the city. Fortunately, the political institutions and people's organizations in various places have given special preferential treatment and provided a large number of materials. I will gradually refer to them and use them to help the city develop." (Eleventh)</p>

<h3>Suspension of Surtax and Overdue Fines on Land Tax</h3>
<p>In Jiangsu Province, a 1% surtax is added to the land tax per mu. If the payment deadline is missed, overdue fines are also levied on the added surtax, which is allocated to educational funding. The provincial government has approved the Ministry of Finance's request to suspend the levy from the 23rd year to relieve the burden on rural areas. The document assumes that with a land tax of 30 million yuan, the surtax under the mu levy amounts to only 60,000 yuan if 20% is overdue. Now that the provincial funds have allocated 2 jiao per shi from the rice tax, the educational expenses have already increased by more than 300,000 yuan based on the calculation of 1.6 million shi of rice collected annually in Jiangsu. This fine is no longer necessary to collect. After receiving the document, the county government has instructed the two collection offices to comply.</p>
<h3>Party Affairs Guidance Commissioner Arrives in Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Provincial Party Department, following the Central Government's order to promulgate the regional method of guiding party affairs, has divided the province into several regions, with various members responsible for guidance.

<h3>Unemployed Police Officer Commits Suicide by Shooting</h3>
<p>Liu Qiliang, an unemployed police officer in this county, is 25 years old and from Hengzhou, Hunan. He once served as a police officer in the county police team and was friends with Zhang Yuanqing, a guard in the Panlongzhen security group. After Liu was laid off in February, he still lingered in the county. On</p>
<p>the night before last, he took a boat to Panlong and was allowed by Zhang to stay overnight. At dawn the next day, Liu suddenly took a gun and committed suicide, shooting himself in the chest and falling to the ground. After hearing the news, Zhang immediately reported to Sun Jia, saying that his friend Liu Qiliang had arrived at the regiment last night and committed suicide due to economic distress, requesting instructions. Sun Jia reported this to the district regiment headquarters, which in turn reported it to the county government for inspection. Yesterday, the county sent inspectors to inspect the result, confirming that it was suicide. It was also instructed that the body be placed in a coffin for safekeeping pending the return of his family.</p>

<h3>Spring Silkworm Seed Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>This county is a sericultural area. In recent years, the overseas silk market has been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk, so less than one-third of the people raise silkworms and produce seeds. As the silkworm season is approaching, the stores on the road that sell silkworm seeds have reduced prices, but the business is still sparse and few customers are seen. The prices of various brands of silkworm seeds are as follows: Renxu Hall 1 yuan per sheet, Shou Xing brand 1 yuan, Three Gourd 9 jiao 5 fen, Yan Niao brand 9 jiao, Tiger brand 9 jiao, San Yuan brand 8 jiao 5 fen, Xishan 8 jiao, Golden Coin 8 jiao, Pagoda brand 8 jiao, Ox brand 8 jiao, He He 8 jiao, Ruyi 8 jiao, Tian Nu brand 7 jiao 5 fen, Qinglong 7 jiao, and Horse brand 7 jiao. In addition, the instructor of the Hua Xin Silk Rearing Institute outside the South Gate has gone to Yixing, Liyang, and various rural areas to carry out guidance work. At the same time, the sericulture supervision office has also dispatched staff to inspect inferior seeds.</p>
<h3>Sudden Cold Weather Brings Hail</h3>
<p>This county has been experiencing continuous cloudy and rainy weather recently, with a sudden drop in temperature. The thermometer reads only 46 degrees. Yesterday (the twelfth) afternoon around 4 pm, a strong wind suddenly rose, and the weather became colder. Soon after, hail fell heavily. This winter-like weather in spring has greatly affected the wheat in the countryside.</p>

<h3>Financial Department Thoroughly Investigates Grain Tax Fraud</h3>
<p>The grain tax in this county has deep-rooted malpractices. Various clerks have enriched themselves at public expense and misappropriated public funds, amounting to a huge sum of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, causing the expenses of various agencies to not be paid on a monthly basis. The Ministry of Finance has received repeated petitions from the people and sent investigator Yan Shudong to Haimen to investigate thoroughly the day before yesterday (the ninth). After verifying the allegations, Yan went to Tong to report to the province yesterday (the tenth).</p>

<h3>Rioters Destroy Public Security Branch</h3>
<p>Zhong Youfu, a villager in Diaowan, Beijiao, Fengjingzhen, had a conflict with Yuehu Sun the other day, and Sun reported it to the Public Security Branch, requesting an investigation. The Public Security Branch immediately sent the police to summon Zhong. Not only did Zhong refuse to be summoned, but he also secretly gathered more than 30 rioters, who destroyed the instruments, tables, and chairs in the bureau, and the police were beaten and injured. The branch chief was horrified and immediately sent the police to Yangqiao No. 38 to ask the bridge guards for assistance. Four rioters were captured on the spot and sent to the Songjiang Public Security Bureau that night for transfer to the County Court for investigation. The doors, windows, and tables in the branch were repaired by workers hired by Director Wang. The injured police were sent to Songjiang Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Wang Hanlun Divorce Case Opens</h3>
<p>The divorce case filed by Wang Hanlun (Peng Jianqing), a veteran star in the film industry, against Wang Jihuan was heard in the Hangzhou County District Court at 8 a.m. on the 12th. Wang Hanlun arrived on time at 8 a.m. with his lawyer Zhang Tao. Wang Jihuan was unable to attend due to returning to his native Changxing to bury his sister-in-law, and only lawyer Song Fu appeared on his behalf. Wang Hanlun wore a dark blue fine floral cheongsam, a light yellow velvet vest, and a French hat. Her face was powdered and she was quite stylish. The courtroom was already full of spectators at 8 a.m. At 8:30 a.m., Judge Yang Delin took the stand and questioned Wang Hanlun about her age, origin, etc. Wang then described the abuse she suffered from Wang Jihuan, who often beat and scolded her, so she requested alimony and divorce, amounting to 92,685 yuan. The lawyer then supplemented her opinion. Because Wang Jihuan did not appear, the judge adjourned the case and continued the hearing in two weeks.</p>

<h3>New Life Movement Week Agricultural Circles Propaganda Convention Held Yesterday at Wusong Middle School, Attended by Over 20,000 Farmers</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of New Life Movement Propaganda Week, originally designated as Agriculture Day. The Municipal Farmers' Association had previously notified all districts to instruct their farmers to participate as much as possible, and to implement methods to promote the New Life Movement in accordance with regulations in their respective locations. Therefore, the meeting was crowded with over 20,000 people. The unprecedented scale of the event greatly interested the farmers, and the distribution of gifts at the Wusong District Agricultural Exhibition organized by the Municipal Farmers' Association added to the lively atmosphere. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue: The venue was located within Wusong Middle School in Wusong Town. A colorful archway was erected in front of the main gate, with a horizontal banner reading "Shanghai Municipal New Life Movement Week Agricultural Circles Propaganda Convention." A platform was set up in the center of the venue, which was spacious enough to accommodate over 50,000 people. Behind it was a large hall where the agricultural exhibition organized by the Municipal Farmers' Association was held. A couplet hung in front of the agricultural exhibition, reading "Cultivation depends on farmers, hoping for abundant field productivity; Improvement relies on science, preserving good varieties for public viewing," with a horizontal banner in the middle reading "Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association Agricultural Products Mobile Exhibition." On display were thousands of items, including rice, wheat, cotton, beans, vegetables, fisheries, animal husbandry, silk, tea, gardens, flowers, plant diseases, pests, new agricultural tools, and various statistical, comparative, and explanatory charts.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Included representatives from the Shanghai Municipal New Life Movement Promotion Association, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Party Headquarters of the Eight Districts, the Wusong District Municipal Committee Office, Wusong Middle School, Tongji High School Affiliated Middle School, Wusong Elementary School, and farmer representatives from thirteen districts including Wusong, Zhabei, Huhang, Gaohang, Yinhang, Yinxiang, Yangjing, Yangsi, Jiangwan, Caojing, Fahua, Pusong, and Pengpu, such as Lu Jingshi, Lin Meiyan, Cheng Kuanzheng, Wang Shuji, Wu Renqi, Liu Shaoxing, Shen Wenbin, Zhao Zuolin, and Gao Jiyun, totaling over a hundred people.</p>
<p>Agenda: 1. Ringing the bell to start the meeting; 2. Everyone stands at attention; 3. Singing the Party anthem; 4. Paying the highest respects to the Party and National flags and the portrait of the late Premier; 5. The Chairman respectfully reads the late Premier's will; 6. Silent tribute; 7. Chairman's report; 8. Speeches; 9. Reading the New Life Covenant; 10. Photograph; 11. Adjournment.</p>
<p>Convention Staff: 1. Presidium: Yu Zhenhui, Shen Ruoxu, Zhang Huijun, Tang Zanzhi, Yin Gongtian; 2. Recorder: Zheng Fengchu; 3. Master of Ceremonies: Ding Zhenyan; 4. Reception: Wu Zijiu, Wu Renqi, Jin Wenyuan, Xiao Huijing.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Yu Zhenhui reported that today is Agriculture Day, the fourth day of the Municipal New Life Movement Propaganda Week. That is why the Farmers' Association is holding an agricultural propaganda convention here. Although the weather is not clear, so many people are participating, which shows that the future development of the New Life Movement will certainly be very prosperous. Briefly speaking, the significance of the New Life Movement is to enable everyone to "understand propriety and righteousness" and "know integrity and shame," so that daily life can be "orderly," "clean," "simple," and "plain." The details of the theory and methods have been discussed by famous speakers at this association, so I will not elaborate further. This New Life Movement was initiated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, hoping that those above will influence those below. After participating today, I hope that everyone can implement the New Life Covenant when they return, so as not to betray the great significance of holding this meeting.</p>
<p>Representative Speeches: Lu Jingshi's speech briefly stated that many men and women compatriots have attended today's meeting, which can be described as grand. The significance of holding this meeting is to enable everyone to understand the necessities of life for the people, such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, so that they can follow the right path. Because Chinese people's habits are too free, they have forgotten propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and there is no basis for orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, and plainness. Everyone must know that the rise and fall of national power is greatly related to the national spirit. Like the general Chinese people, being casual and sloppy is a very bad phenomenon. Therefore, the New Life Movement is a movement urgently needed by Chinese society today. The purpose of this movement is to correct casual habits, so that they conform to modern survival in order to achieve the goal of national revival. Cheng Kuanzheng, Lin Meiyan, and other representatives also gave speeches, mostly elaborating on the significance of the New Life Movement, with many insightful words.</p>
<p>Reading the Covenant: Finally, Chairman Tang Zanzhi read the covenant item by item, moving the listeners. After the reading, a photograph was taken, and gifts from the agricultural exhibition were distributed, including monosodium glutamate from Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, tooth powder from the Family Industry Association, and over 2,000 pieces of bean cakes, agricultural tools, and miscellaneous items donated by various circles in Wusong. By the time the meeting adjourned, the lights of thousands of homes were already lit. The Wusong District New Life Movement Promotion Association has scheduled a lantern parade from tomorrow to the 15th, and a kite competition will be held on the afternoon of the 15th.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Qing Party Commemoration, The Chinese Rental District Authorities Strictly Guarded</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Kuomintang's purge of the Communist Party. The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters specially convened representatives from all walks of life in the city at 10:00 AM to hold a commemoration. Over 200 representatives from various agencies, organizations, schools, and party headquarters attended. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Decoration:</p>
<p>The venue was set up in the auditorium of the Municipal Party Headquarters on Fenglin Bridge. The Party and National flags and a white cloth banner were hung in front of the main gate, with the words "Shanghai Municipal Representatives from All Walks of Life Hold Qing Party Commemoration Convention." In the center of the auditorium, the Party and National flags and the late Premier's portrait were hung, with order slogans posted on both sides, and slogans plastered all over the walls, creating a solemn scene.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report:</p>
<p>After performing the ceremony, Chairman Tong Xingbai reported, briefly saying, "Today we are holding the seventh anniversary of the Qing Party Commemoration. Seven years ago, our party launched the Qing Party because our party accommodated the Communists at that time, and the Communists mutated midway. Therefore, there was a move to purge the Communist Party. At that time, the Communist Party joined our party as party members, parasitized under our party, used the strength of our party, and used our party as a puppet, using tricks to manipulate all aspects of the party, government, and military. Before our party went north, because the area in Guangdong was small, it was able to control it. But when it went north, most of our party's talents developed outwards. Seeing this situation, the Communist Party was bound to take advantage of it, and then used various means to undermine the progress of the revolutionary army. Therefore, the Northern Expedition suffered a major blow. At that time, the commander was Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who felt very painful that he was being constrained by the Communist Party everywhere. Therefore, he had plans to make Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces as bases, and implement a joint effort with loyal comrades to purge the Communist Party. At this time, although the Communist Party had potential power, it could not leave our party and be independent after all. Therefore, once the Qing Party was implemented, the Communist Party was wiped out. At that time, our party comrades had two kinds of propositions, one supporting and one opposing. One said that since the late Premier had accommodated the Communist Party first, the Qing Party would inevitably violate the late Premier's intention. The other said that the late Premier accommodated the Communist Party before, hoping that the Communist Party would help our party's revolution. Now the Communist Party is hindering our party's revolution, so it should of course be purged. In fact, the late Premier's purpose of accommodating the Communist Party was to complete the revolution. The Communist Party later destroyed the revolution and should have this kind of Qing Party action. Therefore, accommodating the Communist Party and purging the Communist Party were both to complete the revolution, which is our party's consistent policy. Today, our people have two meanings for the Qing Party Commemoration: 1. To revive our party, because our party existed in name only at that time. The Communist Party used the Kuomintang as a banner and did Communist Party work everywhere. If it was not purged at that time, our party would have no room for existence. 2. To revive the nation, because the Communist Party intended to dedicate China to the Third International and be a continuation of Russia. Fortunately, our party was not afraid of danger at that time, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek united with his comrades to implement the Qing Party, and then there is today's Republic of China." (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Slogans:</p>
<p>1. Eliminate the Red Bandits, 2. Loyal Comrades Unite, Concentrate Revolutionary Forces, 3. Practice Production and Construction, 4. Practice the New Life Movement, 5. Long Live the Three Principles of the People, 6. Long Live the Chinese Kuomintang Strict Alert:</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command, the Municipal Security Department, and other military and police agencies, taking into account that yesterday was the Qing Party Commemoration, were deeply afraid that unscrupulous people would collude with reactionaries and disrupt public order. Therefore, they ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau and its subordinate military and police agencies to have double posts on the main traffic arteries and at the junctions of the Chinese and rental districts. Male and female inspectors and detectives were all on patrol, and suspicious pedestrians were inspected. The British and French concessions also sent detectives from the political department to patrol the main roads.</p>
<h3>T.V. Soong Scheduled to Depart for the Northwest, on the 21st of this Month</h3>
<p>Simin News Agency, Shanghai, 12th dispatch: The reports in today's newspapers that Economic Committee Standing Committee member T.V. Soong will postpone his trip to the Northwest are not true. According to reliable sources, Mr. Soong will depart on April 21st (Saturday). The reason for the postponement is that it is still necessary to collect various materials related to the development of the Northwest.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister H.H. Kung Hosts Tea Party for Rodgers This Afternoon, Location Set at the Duchene Hotel on Jiangxi Road; Kung and Rodgers Arrive in Shanghai Together This Morning</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency: Professor James Rogers, the silver expert specially dispatched by U.S. President Roosevelt to China to investigate the silver price issue, arrived in Shanghai this Tuesday. Due to the fatigue of the journey, he rested in Shanghai for two days, and then took the night train to Beijing the night before to visit Finance Minister H.H. Kung and exchange informal opinions on the U.S. silver price increase issue. Xin Xin News Agency reporter learned from the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance that Mr. Rogers had met with Finance Minister Kung in Beijing yesterday morning and decided to take the night express train together from Beijing and return to Shanghai last night at 11:00 PM, arriving in Shanghai at about 7:30 AM this morning. It is also learned that Finance Minister Kung has scheduled a tea party at the Duchene Hotel on Jiangxi Road at 12:00 PM this afternoon to host Mr. Rogers, and has also invited leaders from the banking industry in the city, such as Zhang Gongquan, Pei Songsun, Xu Jiyu, Qin Runqing, Chen Xing, Li Fuxun, Hu Mengjia, and T.V. Soong, to accompany him. The invitations were issued yesterday.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Management of Cotton Mills Said to Be Inaccurate by Both Rong and Lin</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that Chinese cotton mills, due to poor business, owed the banking industry 120 million yuan and were unable to repay it, and that most of the cotton mills would be transferred to the management of the banking industry. On the other hand, the Japanese also tried to maneuver and planned to contact the banking industry to take over the management. Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, considering that the cotton mill industry is the largest industry in our country, and if it is true, it will have a great impact on society, specially visited leaders in the cotton mill industry and the banking industry. According to their responsible statements, it is known that it is completely inaccurate. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing's Talk:</p>
<p>According to cotton mill industry leader Rong Zongjing, in a talk with the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter who visited him, the report that Chinese cotton mills are transferred to the banking industry is completely inconsistent with the facts. Moreover, this city does not need such a large amount of loans. It is a fact that the cotton mill industry and the banking industry have dealings. It is said that the amount of loans is as high as 120 million, and ideally, the banking industry in this city will never have such a large amount of funds to lend to the cotton mill industry. Because Chinese banks have no such surplus funds in their entire assets except for reserves. Therefore, what was reported yesterday is completely baseless and speculative, and it is clear that villains have other purposes, destroying the entire credit of the cotton mill industry, and then affecting society and destroying industry, which is very sad.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Talk:</p>
<p>According to Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Industry Association, the report that Chinese cotton mills have lost more than half of their capital, so the debts to the banking industry are not repaid, and the management rights will be transferred to the banking industry is completely fictitious. Because according to the Company Law, if the share capital loses more than half, it cannot be established at all. As for the economic strength of cotton mills such as Wing On and Shenxin, it has always been sufficient, so the rumors are not credible. Moreover, the decline in productivity due to the impact of the world economic downturn is not only the cotton mill industry, but other industries are also feeling the same, not only our country, but also European and American countries are the same. As for the transfer of management, the banking industry will never do this, because all kinds of management require specialized talents. As for the dealings, all have goods as collateral. Therefore, the banking industry and the cotton mill industry have a chain relationship. Cotton mill industry loans can flow their materials, and the banking industry can use its funds and receive interest. Although small-scale cotton mills have closed down, large-scale cotton mills have joint obligations, and their credit has always been stable, so this is completely inaccurate. Cotton Mill Association Statement:</p>
<p>Also, according to the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, the report is not known on what basis. The association is also very surprised. This kind of speculation is intended by villains, and those with knowledge will not be fooled by it. Therefore, the association has no need to make a statement on this matter.</p>
<h3>The American-Asia Silk Factory Resumed Work Yesterday in Compliance with Orders, Workers Refused to Resume Work; The Company Decided to Submit a Request to the Party and Government Authorities for Handling; The Social Affairs Bureau Still Mediates the Wage Reduction Case According to Law; The Production and Sales Cooperation Association Submits a Request to the Central Government for Relief</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency: After the Party and government authorities jointly issued a notice ordering the workers of the American-Asia Silk Weaving Factory to resume work and the company to resume operation in the wage reduction strike case, the company resumed operation yesterday in compliance with orders, but the workers actually refused. The Social Affairs Bureau decided to mediate according to law. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Resuming Work in Compliance with Orders:</p>
<p>After the American-Asia Silk Weaving Factory Co., Ltd. was instructed by the Social Affairs Bureau to resume operation, it immediately sent craftsmen to organize the machines in each factory. Yesterday morning, it resumed operation by ringing the bell in compliance with orders. At the same time, the notice jointly issued by the Party and government authorities, ordering the workers to resume work first, was posted at the gates of each factory. The Municipal Public Security Bureau specially ordered the police stations in each district to send police nearby to protect the workers' resumption of work.</p>
<p>Workers Refused:</p>
<p>After the American-Asia Silk Weaving Factory resumed operation in compliance with orders, all the workers in the ten factories, more than 4,000 people, including the main factory on Malang Road in the French Concession, the second factory on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei, the third and fourth factories on Jiaozhou Road in Western Shanghai, the fifth and sixth factories on Xietu Road in Southern Shanghai, the eighth factory on Dapu Bridge, the ninth factory on Qu Zhenren Road, and the tenth factory on Yokohama Road in Zhabei, all violated the notice jointly issued by the Party and government authorities and refused to resume work yesterday.</p>
<p>Company Report:</p>
<p>The American-Asia Silk Weaving Factory decided to prepare a report today to request the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters to handle the case because the workers violated the orders of the Party and government and refused to enter the factory to work. It will also ring the bell to resume operation as usual this morning, hoping that the workers will realize and enter the factory to work. As for the workers' food case, the company has stated that it has not stopped it. After being instructed by the Social Affairs Bureau to maintain it as usual the day before yesterday, the workers' food in the seventh and tenth factories was supplied as usual yesterday.</p>
<p>Authorities' Disposal:</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau, for the wage reduction strike dispute in the American-Asia Silk Weaving Factory, in addition to jointly issuing a notice with the Municipal Party Headquarters, ordering the workers to resume work immediately and the company to maintain the workers' food as usual, decided to continue to convene the Labor-Capital Mediation Committee to continue to mediate according to law on the issue of wage reduction.</p>
<p>Association's Submission:</p>
<p>The China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, considering that the American-Asia labor unrest has been going on for more than half a month since it occurred, and if it is not resolved as soon as possible, it will inevitably lead to factory closure and shutdown, which will have a profound impact on the national economy and people's livelihood, yesterday telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Ministry of Industry, and the Shanghai Municipal Government in Nanjing, urging them to find ways to provide relief in order to maintain production. The original text reads, "Recently, a letter from the American-Asia Silk Weaving Factory stated that our factory has unfortunately experienced a labor unrest, which has lasted for 37 days. Although the Party and government have mediated, it has been ineffective. It is found that the cause of this labor unrest is superficially caused by our factory's wage reduction, but in fact it is caused by workers being used and manipulated by others. The reason for our factory's wage reduction is entirely due to the silk market's plummet in recent years. The silk price has fallen below the cost, and the wages still account for 10% of the selling price (for example, the most common Hehe crepe, when the selling price of one piece was more than 20 yuan in the past, the wage was 1.2 yuan, accounting for 5% of the selling price. Recently, each piece is only sold for about 10 yuan, but the wage is still not reduced, so it accounts for 10% of the selling price). Each piece sold loses a lot of money. Other silk weaving factories have already reduced wages to reduce costs. Our factory, in order to maintain the company's survival and the livelihood of all employees, and to avoid losing all the money and closing down, had to announce a reduced wage on March 1. However, the reduced wage is still higher than the current wage of other silk factories. Unexpectedly, a few workers actually incited and forced more than 3,000 workers to strike collectively on March 3. Repeated persuasion and explanation were ignored. We had no choice but to announce on March 14 that all would resume work on March 17, otherwise, it would be regarded as automatic dismissal in accordance with Article 26 of the factory regulations approved by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and all would be dismissed and new workers would be recruited. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau immediately approved the order to suspend the implementation and wait for mediation. Our factory, after receiving the order, was waiting for mediation, but the workers relied on the masses, or rioted, and falsely claimed that workers were shot, or destroyed the office, or guarded the telephone, or beat the welfare officers, or imprisoned the factory director, or locked the factory gate, or cut off traffic, or distributed reactionary publications, all of which were unreasonable and extremely arrogant. It is found that our factory was reorganized into a limited company in February last year by merging various joint venture factories. All the share capital is machinery and money-making. The only thing that can be used for activities is the loans from the silver and money industry. When the strike exceeded half a month, the silver and money industry felt the danger of lending money, and immediately notified to stop overdraft or urge the mortgage. The economic turnover was in extreme difficulty. Various orders in the same place also failed to be delivered on time. Customers came to question and demanded compensation for losses. The workers were like crazy, unreasonable. After two mediations by the Social Affairs Bureau, they finally refused to comply. Our factory's economy is exhausted, production is cut off again, arrogant workers cannot be dismissed, and new workers cannot be recruited. We are trapped in this dead end, and we are at a loss. We are forced to this point, and there is no other way but to stop work. We have always admired your association as the leader in the national product industry, and we spare no effort to protect industry and commerce. We dare to send a letter to request your assistance, and send a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the national Party and government agencies, to unanimously advocate fairness and find ways to provide relief, which is our hope, etc. Approved this, it is found that the American-Asia Silk Weaving Factory has been established for many years and has a magnificent scale. The various new and beautiful styles it produces are not only popular in China, but also well-known overseas. If it is allowed to close down and stop work, it will be a great loss to our country's production industry. For this reason, we hereby appeal to your ministry (government) to find ways to provide relief, so that it can resume operation as soon as possible, which is greatly fortunate."</p>

<h3>Newspaper Reports on Yangtze River Shipping Conditions: Chinese Business Development, Foreign Company Decline</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese newspaper, the Mainichi Shimbun, the trade conditions in the Yangtze River shipping industry have been declining year by year in recent years. On the three major routes, Shanghai-Hankou, Hankou-Yichang, and Hankou-Hunan, the total tonnage of cargo loaded by foreign ships in the past year was 1.3 million tons, a decrease of 830,000 tons compared to the previous year. Especially since the anti-Japanese movement started the year before last, the impact on Japan has been particularly great, while Chinese ships have taken the opportunity to become active. Other British and American ships have also suffered significant blows. However, British shipping companies have focused specifically on shipping between Shanghai and Yichang, so the decline compared to the previous year has been slightly less. As for the Yichang-Chongqing route, Japanese ships have almost completely stopped operating since the Manchurian Incident and have not yet resumed. Currently, all routes in Sichuan are almost exclusively occupied by the China National Corporation, thanks to the support of the Sichuan authorities. According to the investigation, the transportation volume on the aforementioned three major routes in the past year was drastically reduced to 36% compared to 1930. For example, on the Shanghai-Hankou route, it was 1.06 million tons in 1930, but decreased to 680,000 tons last year. The Hankou-Yichang route decreased to 66%, and the Hankou-Hunan route decreased to 25%. British companies like Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson, as well as American companies like Standard Oil, although focusing on direct shipping between Shanghai and Yichang, have seen their business conditions plummet. Japanese ships have suffered a fatal blow. On the contrary, the cargo loaded by Chinese ships increased in the past year compared to 1930. For example, the Shanghai-Hankou route increased by 26%, the Hankou-Yichang route increased by 59%, and the Hankou-Hunan route even increased by more than double. As for the upstream routes, there used to be intense competition among British, American, French, and Japanese ships between Yichang and Chongqing. However, Chinese ships, due to weak financial resources, were unable to compete, and bankruptcies were frequently heard. Later, with the support of the Sichuan authorities, foreign ships were the first to be affected, and Chinese ships gradually emerged in response. For example, the Japanese Nissin Shipping Company had to suspend operations because all Japanese businesses there withdrew. However, the business in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River is also in a difficult situation due to natural disasters and man-made calamities. Although various companies have lowered freight rates and fares in an effort to attract cargo and passengers, they have ultimately failed to reverse the declining trend. Foreign shipping companies have suffered the most losses. For example, the freight rate for cotton yarn used to be more than 30 yuan per bale, and the revenue per voyage was 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Today, with lowered freight rates, the revenue per voyage is only 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The business of foreign companies has fallen into an unthinkable predicament.</p>

<h3>Mr. Xiang Songmao's Funeral Scheduled: Burial of Clothing and Hat Conducted Due to Lack of Remains</h3>
<p>Memorial service to be held on May 1st, funeral on May 2nd.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang Songmao, a prominent figure in the business community, was kidnapped during the January 28th Shanghai Incident while bravely trying to rescue a clerk of the Wuzhou Pharmacy's North Sichuan Road branch who had been abducted. At that time, Chinese and Western authorities and various legal entities, as well as Xiang's relatives and friends, negotiated and rescued him in different ways. His eldest son, Longxun, even went into the battlefield three times to rescue him, but to no avail. Later, it was confirmed by all parties that Xiang died on January 31st of the 21st year of the Republic (1932). His remains were never found. His family was deeply saddened but still hoped for his return. Now they have given up hope. It is now heard that Mr. Xiang's family has scheduled the funeral ceremony for April 16th at 10:00 AM at his residence inside the Wuzhou Gubenzao Pharmacy factory in Xujiahui. Only a hat and gown will be placed in the coffin. The memorial service will be held on May 1st at the Siming Public Hall on Minguo Road, and the funeral will be held on May 2nd, with the coffin being sent back to his hometown. Mr. Xiang had extensive social connections throughout his life and sacrificed his life for righteousness. There will be a grand and mournful occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Mechanical Industry Association Submits Proposal to the Yuan Department to Supplement the Interpretation of the Trademark Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical National Products Factory Association has submitted a proposal to the Legislative Yuan for supplementary interpretation of the Trademark Law. The original submission stated that the different interpretations of the Trademark Law are detrimental to national credibility and requested that a proposal be made for supplementation. According to Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law, the words, graphics, and symbols are originally three different types. If the words do not contain sound or meaning, they are no different from graphics or symbols. Why must words be the premise? This shows that words must contain sound and meaning. Whether a person is literate or illiterate depends on whether they can read the sound of the word. If a deaf person wants to test whether they truly recognize a word, they must write another word with the same sound to show to others. This is a matter of course. For people who are illiterate, the buying and selling of goods completely depends on what they hear and say. If trademarks with the same sound but different characters are allowed to be registered, wouldn't this encourage confusion? This is not allowed by the Trademark Bureau's practice. However, since the Executive Yuan requested an interpretation from the Judicial Yuan, it has been said that words do not include sound or meaning and are regarded as graphic symbols in general. This will allow cunning people to compete to use trademarks with the same sound but different characters, which is an act of deceiving the public, affecting the future of industry and commerce, and overturning the precedents of trademarks. The dignity of trademark registration has disappeared from the root. Whether it is domestic or foreign, it is sufficient to hinder national credibility. The only way to solve this problem is to request your esteemed Yuan to supplement Articles 1 and 2 of the Trademark Law in accordance with the spirit of legislation, so as to appease people's hearts and prevent the wind of opportunism. As far as Article 1, Paragraph 2 is concerned, the original meaning is very broad, and it is not necessary to indicate that the words include sound and meaning. Because there is no prior registration by others, there is no so-called same or similar. Therefore, the crackdown is listed in the various clauses of Article 2. The original intention of the legislation is very appropriate. However, for "designating the colors to be used," it is proposed to add the word "allowed" after the word "parallel," because as stipulated in the original text, even if only one color is clearly used, or there is no color at all, such as on glass bottles or iron caps, imitators can take different colors to argue. If the original registrant has to prevent this, they must first register similar trademarks of various colors one by one. The Trademark Bureau will get a large income, but the industry and commerce will not be able to afford it, and it will also be impossible to prevent. Therefore, if the word "allowed" is added, it is not necessary, and similar items are already subject to crackdown. This is the request for Article 1, Paragraph 2. After listing the various clauses in Article 2, it is proposed to supplement one clause, "The aforementioned same or similar items include the form, color, sound, and meaning of words, graphics, and symbols. Anyone suspected of allusion is included." Because the Trademark Law does not have clear regulations on the definition of similarity, it is a major defect. Therefore, the results of the same case are different, and there are conflicts before and after, which makes people at a loss. If it is clearly stipulated, it will be enough to prevent opportunism and avoid various disputes. For this reason, a written request is submitted to your esteemed Yuan for adoption, so as to contribute a humble opinion. The submission to the Ministry of Industry is the same and omitted.</p>
<h3>Customs Office Approves Reduction of Fines in Hainan Island Sugar Dispute Case</h3>
<p>The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the Hainan Island Sugar Dispute case, stating that the Haikou City Jusheng and Hesheng firms transported 138 packages of white sugar to Shanghai and were fined by the Qionghai Customs. According to the Chamber of Commerce's telegram, the Customs Superintendent has verified that the sugar transported by the two firms was genuine local sugar, but it did not match the original factory sugar samples because it was mixed with foreign sugar. The firms originally intended to falsely declare the white sugar mixed with foreign sugar for export, but because the sugar transported by Futai and other seven firms was mixed with foreign sugar and was seized by the Customs, the two firms changed the declaration to transport local sugar to avoid punishment. Therefore, they were punished in the same way as Futai and other firms as a warning. However, considering that the sugar samples of the two firms did not match, although there was a suspicion of opportunism, they still knew how to repent, and the sugar they transported was genuine local sugar, which was somewhat different from the current case of criminals. The original fine of 1,030 yuan in national currency imposed by the Qionghai Customs will be reduced by 50%, which is a reduction of 515 yuan, so as to distinguish and show sympathy. In addition to ordering the Customs Superintendent to forward the order for compliance and approving the merchants, they should be informed.

<h3>Taixing Lane Landlord Voluntarily Reduces Rent: District Seven Association Sends Special Letter of Appreciation</h3>
<p>The Zhabei District Rent Reduction Association reported yesterday that the landlord Yuan Shouji of Taixing Lane in the district had voluntarily reduced the rent by 30% in accordance with the rent reduction principle of the City General Association. This generous and righteous act is truly rare and should be commended on their behalf. It is heard that the District Association will not only send a special letter of appreciation but also intend to widely publicize it to promote benevolence.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Request for Exemption of Industrial Alcohol Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, Nanjing, stating that according to the joint letter from the Cosmetics Industry and Soap Industry Associations of the city on the 10th of this month, alcohol is an important raw material in industry, and the stamp duty should be exempted to show equal treatment for Chinese and foreign merchants. It also requested the Ministry of Industry to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance for investigation and handling in order to maintain the national industry. The Chamber of Commerce also investigated that alcohol is an important raw material in industry, and the industry is also required to manufacture various items such as cologne and soap. However, the source of this alcohol is mostly from foreign countries. Although Chinese merchants have set up factories to manufacture it, the supply is still insufficient. According to the revised tariff regulations of May 22, 1933, the import of foreign alcohol is subject to a customs duty of 45.6 cents per gallon (approximately 91 cents in national currency), including surtax. Foreign merchants who set up factories in the concessions are exempt from stamp duty in addition to paying import duties, and there are no obstacles to transportation within the concessions. However, Chinese merchants in the Chinese territory must pay an additional 20 yuan per 100 catties (approximately 1.5 yuan per gallon) in stamp duty in accordance with Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Foreign Wine Tax issued by the Ministry on June 3, 1929, in addition to paying the same amount of customs duty. Occasionally, if the tax payment procedures are not fully understood, the goods are immediately detained or confiscated and punished. The tax burden of Chinese merchants is more than double that of foreign merchants. For factories that use alcohol worth 10,000 yuan in national currency annually, the alcohol tax is estimated to be 8,000 yuan if they are located in the Chinese territory. If they are located in the concessions, they will not only benefit from the procedures and time, but also the rent in the concessions is not higher than that in the Chinese territory in recent years. The annual difference is such a huge amount of tax. Therefore, they can only move the factory to the concessions. If the factories in the Chinese territory are successively moved to the concessions, how can the Wusong Zhabei districts, which were burned down during the January 28th Incident, be restored? The Chamber of Commerce's member factories all require alcohol as a raw material, and the manufacturers in the Chinese territory alone are obligated to pay stamp duty. For this reason, the facts are presented and the association is requested to verify and forward them to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for separate handling, and to grant equal treatment to Chinese and foreign merchants for alcohol, which is necessary for industrial raw materials, and to exempt them from stamp duty in order to maintain the national industry and benefit post-disaster reconstruction. The association received the aforementioned request. The Soap Industry Association had previously sent a separate letter requesting the same, and the association had telegraphed the Ministry on January 4 of this year, requesting it to be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for handling. Subsequently, the Ministry's Industry Letter No. 9120 informed that the Ministry of Finance had approved that the alcohol was planning to change the unified tax, and before it was implemented, it should be handled in accordance with the existing regulations, which was forwarded for information. According to the previous situation, the same factory is compared between the one located in the Chinese territory and the one located in the concessions. If the annual alcohol consumption is valued at 10,000 yuan, the factory in the Chinese territory must pay 8,000 yuan more in tax. The difference in treatment between Chinese and foreign merchants is so great, how can Chinese factories compete? Changing the unified tax is one thing, and equal treatment for Chinese and foreign merchants is another. If they must be mutually constrained and discussed together, then the years will be long and the burden will be particularly heavy. It is feared that it will be like the ancient saying of searching for Chinese factories in the dry fish shop, and there will be a re-statement of the situation and request. The Ministry is requested to verify and approve the forwarding of the request to the Ministry of Finance for its prior planning of a policy of equal treatment for concession factories and Chinese territory factories before the alcohol is changed to a unified tax, so that Chinese factories can compete for survival. This is convenient for the public. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests.</p>
<h3>Salt Affairs Administration Replies to City Chamber of Commerce That Medicinal Niter and Sulfur Will Be Handled as Before: Meanwhile, Flexible Measures Are Being Drafted</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association regarding the inconvenience of obtaining medicinal niter and sulfur and immediately telegraphed the Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance to request flexible handling. Now it has received the Administration's reply, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, the telegrams from Yuan Ma on behalf of the Association have been fully noted. The transport of niter and sulfur products weighing less than two dan can be released at the discretion of the Customs Superintendent, this measure has been cancelled by order of the Ministry and it is difficult to adopt it again. However, the various points mentioned in the telegram are still factual and should be dealt with flexibly to show sympathy. The current rules of the National Government for niter and sulfur passports are being submitted for amendment, and the flexible measures for obtaining small amounts of niter and sulfur products for medical use will be clearly stipulated in the rules. However, before the amended rules are approved and promulgated, they should still be handled in accordance with the current regulations. This is a special reply and it is hoped that it will be forwarded for notification. Seal of Jia, Salt Affairs Administration.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Sun Jingya's Mother Dies: Inconvenient to Return Home, Memorial Service Will Be Held in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The mother of Central Committee member Sun Jingya, Madam Yu, recently died of illness in Shatou, south of Tengtian, Yongfeng County, Jiangxi Province, Sun is currently in Shanghai, and because the area is in a bandit area and transportation is cut off, it was not until yesterday that the news was reported by relatives and friends. Sun learned of the news,</p>
<p>In addition to grief, because it is inconvenient to rush to the bandit area to attend the funeral, he has separately sent a confidant to secretly return to his hometown to take care of everything on his behalf, and plans to set up a memorial service in his Shanghai residence to pay his respects.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Business Community Expands Southwest National Products Market: Decision to Form Company, Establishment After Investigation Next Month: Qian Chengxu Talks About Three Difficulties in Promotion</h3>
<p>Guo Shun, Qian Chengxu, Hu Xiyuan, and other standing committee members of the Shanghai Industrial General Assembly were previously invited by Chairman Han of Shandong Province.</p>
<p>After organizing an industrial inspection team to Shandong for investigation, they planned to continue to the southwestern provinces for investigation. According to Mr. Qian Chengxu, who spoke to an industry reporter about the recent progress of the team and the plan to expand the Southwest National Products Market, the following is recorded:</p>
<p>Inspection of the Southwest</p>
<p>In order for the team to contact the authorities in the southwestern provinces to discuss inspection matters and investigate the production and sales of national products in various places to prepare for the expansion of the Southwest National Products Market, team member Zheng Yizhi was dispatched to Hong Kong to visit the two Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. The team received a telegram from Mr. Zheng from Guangzhou yesterday stating that he will go to Wuzhou and other places in Guangxi Province on the 15th of this month and asked to prepare for the inspection. The team has now decided to depart in early next month, and Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, Wu Yun Chu, and others will participate.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Promotion</p>
<p>However, there are many obstacles to the expansion of the Southwest National Products Market. The greatest difficulties are: 1) Stagnant finances and high exchange rates. For example, in Yunnan and Guizhou, the exchange rate for sending 100 yuan to Shanghai is 40 to 50 yuan. Therefore, the price of goods in Shanghai has to be increased to maintain costs. 2) Blocked transportation and inconvenient transportation. The cost of water transportation is quite high, and goods from Yunnan must pass through Annam Haiphong for import and are controlled by foreigners. Merchants in Guangxi and other places who want to purchase goods must also go through Guangzhou merchants, which is a heavy layer of exploitation. 3) The southwestern provinces are located on the border, and foreign goods have the advantage of geographical convenience, which makes them flood the market. It is by no means possible to achieve victory in the long-distance expedition of national goods overnight. In summary, the above points are all obstacles to the sales of national goods.</p>
<p>Organization of Company</p>
<p>In view of the above difficulties, the team decided to organize a large-scale company with a capital of 2 million yuan. The proposed plan is to start with the exchange of goods between the two places and to balance their value so that neither party differs too much to avoid losses on exchange rates. A survey has been started on the quantity of products from the southwestern provinces needed in Shanghai, and Zheng Yizhi has also conducted a detailed survey in Guangdong on the goods from Shanghai needed in the province. A report will be sent to Shanghai soon. The team plans to start organizing as soon as the inspection is completed to establish the company as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Two More Communists Surrender</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Zhang Jingde (namely Wang Shaoquan), the former Communist Party's false mutual aid general assembly party secretary, and Chen Yongzhao, the false propaganda minister, finally realized that the Communist Party was murdering, arson, and deceiving farmers and workers, and surrendered one after another, and issued a joint declaration. Zhang is from Jinan, Shandong, and joined the Communist Party in 1927, and served as branch secretary, and iron general inspector. He is currently the party secretary of the Communist Party's mutual aid general assembly. Chen is from Nanhai, Guangdong, and joined the Communist Party in 1926, and served as the editor of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions propaganda department, the central publishing department, and the maritime district propaganda officer. He is currently the propaganda minister of the Communist Party's mutual aid general assembly. The following is a transcript of their joint declaration:</p>
<p>We participated in the Communist Party organization because we recognized the need for the Chinese revolution and, at the same time, the need for revolutionary action to be led by a political group. For the past seven or eight years, we have spared no effort to sacrifice all our personal spirit and ability to engage in struggle. We originally wanted to use our sincere enthusiasm to fight for the liberation of the suffering masses and to save the national crisis. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party only knew how to proceed with its so-called "revolution with the proletariat as the leading center" from a subjective standpoint. China is in a state of semi-colonial economy and is shrouded in the economic power of imperialism. National capital is struggling to rise, and the Communist Party is using methods to provoke class struggle. Needless to say, it will only accelerate the bankruptcy of the national economy. Objectively speaking, it will further facilitate imperialist aggression. This is the Communist Party's fundamental mistake. Moreover, since the August 7th Conference, whether in rural or urban areas, its so-called political line has been nothing more than closing its eyes and driving comrades and the masses to carry out unconditional riots. The blind action of the Qiubai line, the general action of the Li San line, and the two-front struggle of the international line, although the names are different, the essence is the same. Therefore, countless workers and peasants were sacrificed, and countless revolutionary elements were lost. Under the captivity of this wrong line, we have become sinners of the Chinese revolution. How painful this is! Moreover, under the current economic stage, it is impossible to rush out of the countryside into the cities. The Communist Party's rural Soviet policy and the dream of winning several provinces have still not awakened. As a result, in addition to intensifying the destruction of the national vitality, it has no other meaning. In recent years, the shrinking of the Soviet area and the collapse of urban organizations everywhere are enough to prove that communism is not suitable for China and that the Communist Party's political system violates the needs of the people. In the past, we blindly followed due to our weak political theory. Now, after practical inspection, we have suddenly realized. At the same time, we recognize that there is only hope for Chinese politics under the Three Principles of the People's national revival movement of the Kuomintang. Now, we have frankly changed our minds and hope that our revolutionary comrades will wake up quickly. This is a special declaration.</p>
<h3>Third Session of Seafarer Examination to be Held in Beijing on the 24th of this Month</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' third session of seafarer examinations is scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 24th of this month. All candidates and seafarers who failed the previous session (the second session was held in Shanghai) who are allowed to retake the exam must bring a recent 2.5-inch photo of themselves to the Ministry to take the exam. The examination schedule is as follows: (A) Deck officers: 24th morning, Chinese and foreign languages; afternoon, cargo handling, ship management, and seafarer duties; 25th morning, navigation; afternoon, naval architecture and marine engineering knowledge; 26th morning, pilotage, compass science, and meteorology; afternoon, meteorology, scientific principles, and chart application; 27th morning, swimming; afternoon, collision avoidance regulations and signals.

<h3>Summer Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses Distributed on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office began collecting summer license taxes on April 1 and will end on the 10th. In accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, a fine will be added for exceeding the deadline. Tobacco and alcohol merchants in the city, in order to avoid increasing the grade and overdue fines, sent them to the public association for donation within the deadline. The associations will submit them to the tax office in batches on the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th for filling out and issuing. However, due to the large number of members in the tobacco exchange and sauce wine industries, the licenses that should be received have not been filled out and issued as scheduled. Members of the tobacco exchange industry have been requesting the public association to issue licenses in recent days.</p>
<p>The association has explained separately. According to the tax office, due to the large number of licenses in the tobacco exchange industry, it is not convenient to fill them out immediately and they will have to be delayed for four or five days before they can be filled out clearly. There will be no increase in grade for the licenses submitted by the public association, and no overdue fine will be charged. Based on this, the association immediately notified its members that they could pick up and distribute to the various numbers around the 15th or 16th.</p>

<h3>Spring Chill Again in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the weather in Shanghai has been constantly changing between sunny and rainy, and between cold and warm.</p>
<p>When it is cold, it is no different from severe winter, and when it is warm, it seems like early summer. Therefore, those who are not careful in their clothing are prone to disease. The weather was very warm a few days ago, and the Fahrenheit thermometer rose to 60 or 70 degrees. However, the weather suddenly turned cold in the past two days. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, snowflakes suddenly fell from the sky, and the temperature dropped to near zero. Pedestrians in the road were all shivering.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Bans Import of Lead-Based Powders: Commodity Inspection Bureau Ordered to Collect and Analyze</h3>
<p>My country's facial powder industry imports a large amount of goods to the Dutch East Indies every year. According to the analysis results of a Dutch medical professor in Batavia, many of these facial powders contain more than 50% carbonized lead. Lead poisoning invades the blood and brain, which can be fatal. The most common symptom of slow wind in overseas Chinese babies is the result of lead poisoning, which often leads to death. The professor has obtained this evidence and plans to ask the local government to strictly ban the import of powders containing lead poison. The Dutch East Indies Health Bureau is planning to suggest to the government to ban the import of powders containing lead. If implemented, my country's facial powder will be hit hard in the market of the Dutch East Indies. My country's consulate in Surabaya has presented the situation to the Ministry of Industry and earnestly requests all relevant agencies to strictly supervise the production to ensure that powders do not contain any lead so that they will not be rejected when imported. After receiving the report, in addition to ordering the consulate to report the results of the facial powder analysis, the types and names, and the names of the powder companies, it has also ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to collect and analyze the exported facial powder. If it does contain lead poison, it should immediately discuss the ban and improvement measures and report for approval.</p>
<h3>Murder Case Cracked in North Caojiadu: Suspects Arrested in Tea House; Victim Used to Be an Informant</h3>
<p>On the 6th of this month, at 10:00 AM, an unidentified male corpse, a victim of assassination, was discovered in a small river north of Guangfu Road, North Caojiadu, West Shanghai, behind the Zhentai Yarn Factory. Details have already been reported in this newspaper. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team, led by Lu Ying, stationed in the West Shanghai District, has completely solved the case, arresting a total of ten suspects, including murderers and bandits. The detailed investigation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Informant's Tip-off: Geng Shoubao, the foreman of the West Shanghai District Detective Team, and Ni Shoutian, the deputy foreman, instructed all detectives to diligently pursue and arrest the murderers after the assassination. The day before yesterday afternoon, Detective Cao Chuqiao received a confidential tip from an informant stating that the suspects, including Guo Xiaoqi, were at the Shunyuan Tea House in Caojiadu, drinking tea. He immediately reported this to Foreman Geng, who led Detectives Song Yunhe, Wang Lanxin, Zhong Xuehuai, and others to the tea house. They arrested Guo Xiaoqi, Shi Shaoying, Yang Shigou, and Liu Qibao on the spot and brought them back to the Sixth District.</p>
<p>Truth of the Assassination: According to Guo Xiaoqi's confession, he is 35 years old, from Haimen, and lives at No. 39, Grass Shed, North Caojiadu. The deceased's name was Shen Qigou, also from Haimen. Because he was acting as an informant, reporting our robberies to a certain "bao tan" (detective) in the Public Concession, we wanted to kill him. That evening, Shen Qibao was drinking tea at a small tea shop in Caojiadu when Sheng and others lured him to the small riverbank in North Caojiadu. Two unknown individuals first placed a noose around Shen's neck, and then I struck him once with an axe. Shi Shaoying (also known as "Old Three"), Yang Shigou, and Liu Qibao also confessed that they were called upon by Sheng to go along, but they did not lay a hand on him.</p>
<p>Series of Robberies Solved: Guo Xiaoqi also confessed that on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, at 12:00 PM, he, along with Mao Dagou and seven or eight others, went to the Shi family residence at No. 2, Meiyuan, Caohejing, and robbed them of silver, money, and clothing, which they later sold and divided the proceeds. The original team of detectives then went to North Caojiadu and arrested Brother Dagou (28 years old), Lu Wanggen (33 years old), Gu Baoxing (27 years old), and Chen Dianbang (39 years old), along with a female thief named Zhang Lanjie, and brought them back to the Sixth District.</p>
<p>Stolen Goods Recovered: Detectives then went to Guo Xiaoqi's home in North Caojiadu and recovered a hatchet, the murder weapon, as evidence. They also arrested a suspect named Gao Qiyun. They also went to the Yihe Pawnshop at No. 34, Lane 1034, Gordon Road, and retrieved over ten pieces of stolen clothing. District Chief Tan interrogated the thieves separately, and they were held for further questioning by the bureau.</p>
<h3>Ten More Accomplices Apprehended in Major Robbery Case Involving Silk Store and Sugar Warehouse in South City; Huang Defa Arrested on the Spot and Confesses to His Gang; Main Culprit Zhang Yunshi Absconds, Embezzling Stolen Money</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Futaihe Silk and Satin Store at No. 38, Dasheng Lane, Xiaodongmen, and the Lisheng Sugar Warehouse were robbed at 11:30 AM the day before yesterday by four bandits, who made off with over 2,000 yuan in paper money and four pieces of jewelry. One of the bandits was caught by a patrolman while attempting to flee, and a Browning pistol was seized, along with the culprit, and taken to the First District Second Precinct. It is now learned that after capturing the thief, named Huang Defa, 33 years old, from Dongyang, a former tailor who is currently unemployed, the police discovered that he often went to the home of his friend Liu Zhanbiao at No. 11, Lane 2, Tongqingli, Fuxu Road, North City, to chat. Not long after, he was introduced by Liu and others to Zhang Yunshi, who had previously served in the fifth squadron of the Municipal Police Bureau's police brigade. Recently, Zhang learned that the Futaihe Silk and Satin Store regularly had a large amount of cash on hand, leading him to conceive a robbery plan. Lacking accomplices, he invited Huang and his friends Jin Yucheng, Liu Ziqing, and Li Xichun a few days ago to gather at Li's home at No. 4, Dada Lane, Xiqiao, Luban Road, outside the West Gate, where they secretly plotted the robbery. First, Li went to the store under the pretense of buying silk to scout out the store's interior and escape routes. Then, Zhang Yunshi gave them three pistols. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Zhang led Huang, Jin Yucheng, and Liu Ziqing to the store to carry out the robbery, agreeing to meet back at Li's home to divide the loot. However, Zhang and the others made off with the cash, and Huang was unknowingly captured while leaving the store. A large number of patrol officers were dispatched to Li Xichun's home at No. 4, Dada Lane, Xiqiao, Luban Road, outside the West Gate, where the bandits Jin Yucheng, Liu Ziqing, Li Xichun, and suspected accomplices Liu Zhanbiao and the woman Jin Zhushi were arrested and taken to the precinct for preliminary interrogation. Jin Yucheng, 38 years old, from Dezhou, confessed that the robbery of the store was masterminded by Zhang. When they escaped, Zhang instructed Jin and Liu Ziqing to hand over all the stolen money to him for safekeeping. Jin also returned two pistols to Zhang Yunshi. Zhang then arranged to meet them at Li's home that afternoon to divide the loot. After instructing them, they parted ways. That afternoon, Jin and Liu Ziqing went to Li's home as agreed, waiting for Zhang to arrive and divide the spoils. Zhang broke the agreement, embezzling all the stolen money and disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>They waited until about 5 o'clock, but Zhang did not arrive. Only then did they realize they had been</p>
<p>deceived, and they were filled with remorse. As they were about to disperse, the police</p>
<p>arrived, having heard about the situation, and they were all arrested. Liu Ziqing, 38 years old, from Dongyang, confessed, and his statement was similar to Jin's. Li Xichun, also known as Xi Geng, 26 years old, said that Liu was from the same hometown as him and was previously a worker at the Zhenxin Silk Factory in Dapuqiao, but is now unemployed. He did not participate in or conspire in Zhang's robbery of the store, nor did he scout out the store. His brother, Xi Quan, used to be a judge at the Zhejiang Ningxian District Court, so even though he is poor, he would never dare to be a thief. Liu Zhanbiao and Jin Zhushi both claimed to have no knowledge of the robbery. Police officers and detective agents were dispatched to No. 11, Lane 2, Tongqingli, Fuxu Road, where they arrested suspects Cai Shusen, Zhao Wei,</p>
<p>Han Jinbiao, Shen Tianxu, and the woman Han Huangshi. After questioning, each suspect confessed that he did not participate in the robbery of the silk store. It was discovered that the mastermind of the case, Zhang Yunshi, was indeed a police officer in the fifth squadron of the police brigade, but he recently absconded with firearms. Furthermore, most of the major robbery suspects apprehended by the Municipal Police Bureau have confessed that they were instructed by Zhang. The director has ordered all subordinates to strictly pursue the case. The authorities ordered the detainees to be separated and held pending the dispatch of police to pursue and arrest the fugitive Zhang Yunshi for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wang Haiqiu Sentenced in Ma Zhanshan Extortion Case; Fine of 200 Yuan</h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan, the anti-Japanese general who recently retired to Tianjin, received threatening extortion letters and a defamatory booklet published by the Asia Publishing House in February of this year. The Asia Publishing House was located at No. 613, Lafayette Road, in the French Concession of this city. Ma personally prepared a letter and sent his secretary, You, from Wuxian, Jiangsu, to Shanghai to report to the French police and request an investigation and transfer to the court for trial. The French police, upon receiving the report, dispatched Xi Neng (transliteration), the director of the political investigation unit, and Chinese detective Zhao Zibo to No. 613, Lafayette Road, a two-story building housing the Asia Publishing House, at around 8:00 AM on the 22nd of last month. They arrested Wang Haiqiu (32 years old) from Liaoning, and seized two drafts of letters to Ma Zhanshan and three letters of correspondence. Wang was transferred to the Second Special District District Court, where the police lawyer filed a public prosecution for extortion. Wang was ordered to post a bail of 500 yuan pending trial. The trial proceedings have been previously reported. The case has been debated and concluded, and the judgment was rendered yesterday. The defendant and his defense attorney, Xiang, arrived at the court at 9:00 AM to await the verdict. At 10:30 AM, Judge Wang Gangxu rendered the verdict in the First Criminal Court, finding Wang Haiqiu guilty of aiding and abetting attempted extortion and sentencing him to a fine of 200 yuan. If he fails to pay the fine, he will be imprisoned at a rate of two yuan per day. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be credited against the fine at a rate of two yuan per day. The seized evidence, letters, and drafts will be confiscated. During the appeal period, the defendant will remain on the original bail.</p>
<h3>Younger Brother of Zhao Guangzu Requests Division of Property; Claims to Waive Rights to Already Dissipated Assets; Requests Guardianship of Jiangwan Land</h3>
<p>Zhao Guangzu, a Shanghai native, lost his parents at a young age. His relatives, knowing that Zhao's father had left an estate of no less than 200,000 yuan, advised Zhao to marry as soon as possible to have a mistress of the household. Zhao then married Tan Meiying and entrusted her with the management of the family property. Initially, harmony reigned, but Zhao's nature was prone to dalliances, and he frequented brothels. He made a vow with the famous courtesan Mei Fei (Ninth Old Woman), secretly taking the family deeds and giving them to the courtesan, further planning to marry her. When this was discovered by</p>
<p>Tan, it led to a lawsuit. Tan first sued Mei Fei in criminal court and then, due to the breakdown of her relationship with Zhao, filed a civil suit for divorce. After years of litigation, the criminal case was decided, and the divorce case was mediated by the judge, and they reconciled. However, Zhao soon violated the terms of the settlement, leading Tan to file for divorce again. From then on, they parted ways. Zhao, now free from the constraints of family, indulged even more in the pleasures of the flesh, squandering his vast</p>
<p>inheritance, which is now almost completely depleted. Zhao has recently formed a household with the dance queen Wang A'liu of the Great Shanghai Dance Hall at No. 12, Xiangkangli, Meibai Road, living a sweet life. Unbeknownst to him, his brother, Guangde, has filed a lawsuit in court to demand a division of the property. Zhao's parents had two sons, Guangzu being the elder and Guangde the younger. When Zhao's parents passed away, Guangde was still young, and Guangzu was not a paragon of virtue, making it difficult to expect him to educate his brother. Therefore, Guangde resided at the home of his maternal grandmother, Xu Zhang, at No. 15, Lane 327, Huade Road, and was raised by his uncle. He is now grown and is studying at Shanghai University. He disapproves of his brother Guangzu's dissolute behavior and, upon learning that most of his parents' estate has been squandered, with only twenty-odd mu of land in Jiangwan remaining unsold, realized that this property, worth only a few thousand taels of silver, is but a fraction of the total estate. If he does not take action, it may soon be squandered as well. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Guangzu to divide the property. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong of the First Special District District Court convened a hearing. The defendant, Zhao Guangzu, did not appear. The plaintiff stated that all of the inheritance had long been squandered by his brother. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that the defendant, since cohabitating with the dance queen A'liu in Xiangkangli,</p>
<p>still frequents singing halls and dance pavilions, rarely staying at home, making it impossible to serve him with a summons. As for the assets that have already been squandered, even if pursued, the defendant would be unable to return them. Therefore, the plaintiff can only temporarily waive his claim to those assets. He is currently only requesting the Jiangwan land and asks that the court grant the plaintiff guardianship of it. Judge Shen, noting that the defendant did not appear, found it difficult to proceed independently and ordered the case to be adjourned, pending a new summons for the defendant to appear for questioning.</p>
<h3>Joint Transportation Agreement Between Jinghu Railway and Yufeng Steamboat Company for Suzhou and Dongting Mountain Routes Signed; Effective May 1st</h3>
<p>The Yufeng Steamboat Company, which operates between Suzhou and Dongting Mountain, previously requested a joint transportation agreement with the Jinghu Railway. After the Traffic Department negotiated the terms of a passenger joint transportation agreement (baggage and parcels not included), it was submitted to the bureau for approval.

<h3>Shanghai Bicycle Manufacturing and Sales Association Protests Tax Increase</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bicycle Manufacturing and Sales Association previously sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to negotiate the increase in bicycle license fees by the Concession Public Works Department, which was opposed by all members of the industry. This was previously reported. The association has now received a reply from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating: "In response to your letter, the chamber has received your letter stating that the authorities of the British and French Concessions have increased bicycle license fees and listing seven points of protest. You requested the chamber to negotiate on reasonable grounds to cancel the original proposal to increase the fees and to collect the current fees quarterly. You also requested the chamber to forward a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concessions, including the issue on the agenda of this year's meeting and publicly discussing countermeasures. In addition to submitting the request to the Municipal Government for thorough consultation and sending letters to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Public Works Department of the French Concession, requesting reconsideration, the original letter has been forwarded to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concessions, requesting discussion." The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concessions replied: "Received letter No. 4788 from your association on April 4, regarding opposing the increase in bicycle fees by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, etc., and attached printed materials for discussion at the meeting. The chamber has already received a letter from the Shanghai Bicycle Manufacturing and Sales Association with the same content and has forwarded the letter to the Public Works Department for approval. As for including the issue on the agenda of the General Assembly, the chamber should comply with the request. However, as the issue does not involve universality, it seems sufficient to simply send a letter to the department. Respectfully, etc." Approved, accordingly, this reply is hereby sent to you for your information. (Omitted below)" It is now learned that the association has issued a declaration to draw the attention of taxpayers and various organizations and to seek their sympathetic assistance in achieving the goal of canceling the fee increase in order to alleviate the difficulties of Shanghai merchants. The association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concessions proposing an item for discussion at the General Assembly, the original letter stating: "The Concession Public Works Department approves and implements all measures only after the board of directors approves them, without giving full consideration to taxpayers or related parties, often causing repercussions due to conflicts of interest. The human rickshaw problem and the bicycle license fee increase are recent examples. The association believes that for events of great significance to our Chinese taxpayers or related to the business community, the Public Works Department must submit the contents of the event to the Taxpayers Association through the Chinese directors, convene taxpayers to discuss, and have the Taxpayers Association notify the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and representatives of the relevant business groups to conduct careful consideration. If necessary, a request may be made to participate in the Public Works Department Board of Directors to express opinions, so that a comprehensive plan can be made to ensure proper implementation. This can avoid disputes afterwards and facilitate implementation, taking both sides into account, which is actually beneficial to the Public Works Department and should be welcomed. As your association has long been dedicated to protecting the rights and interests of Chinese taxpayers, we have specially made this suggestion, whether or not it is appropriate. We would be grateful if your association would include the item on the agenda for discussion at the April 16th General Assembly. If it is adopted, it would be for the public good. We hope for your kind consideration."</p>

<h3>Predicament of Domestically Produced Printed Silk and Satin; Printed Silk Industry Association Formulates a Method of Identification</h3>
<p>Spring is in the air, and it is time to prepare new clothes. Printed silk and satin are a popular choice for women's clothing this season, and demand is high. Silk stores are competing to stock their shelves. As a result, the printing factories have been working overtime to meet the demand. It has been learned that Japanese factories in Shanghai are secretly planning activities, observing the enthusiasm of Chinese people for domestically produced goods, are still very nervous and dare not show their faces. They are secretly hiring Chinese traitors to act as street runners to solicit printing orders. There are also unscrupulous merchants who falsely establish brands and take on silk, secretly commissioning Japanese factories to print them. In addition, there are even silk merchants who are blinded by greed and buy large quantities of cheap goods from Japan, posing them as domestically produced goods to help sales. All kinds of destructive activities abound. The domestic printing industry is being attacked by hurricanes and adverse waves, and the situation is critical.</p>
<p>The Silk and Satin Printing Industry Association, in view of this, has specifically formulated a method that all goods printed by member factories will have the association's logo and uniform "Shanghai Silk and Satin Printing Industry Association Member, [Factory Name] Finely Printed" mark printed on both ends of each bolt to make it easier for customers to identify. It also intends to send letters to all silk and satin stores and major companies, instructing them to pay attention to the origin of goods during printing and purchasing, so that unscrupulous merchants cannot implement their plans, and inferior goods cannot be mixed in, in order to achieve mutual reliance and coordination.</p>
<h3>Dumping of Japanese Yarn Ribbon</h3>
<p>Japanese Factories in Shanghai Using Chinese Street Vendors; Yarn Ribbon Industry Calls on Users to Identify Products</p>
<p>The National Yarn Industry Factory Association, which is currently being prepared, received a report from members yesterday that a large number of Japanese yarn ribbons have recently been found in the city, using Chinese street vendors to peddle them to various stores and users, causing a severe blow to domestic goods. If a boycott is not urgently implemented and users are not awakened, domestic goods will suffer another invasion. Therefore, an emergency meeting was convened at 2 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss countermeasures. Representatives from over ten factories, including Yixin Xie Factory, Zengsheng Factory, Huayang Xin Factory, Sanxin 1st and 2nd Factories, Tianran Factory, Zhongyang Factory, Dalu Factory, Meiren Factory, and Zhonghua Factory, attended, totaling over twenty people. Lu Xingzhuang was elected as chairman, and the ceremonial rites were performed. The chairman's report stated that Chinese stores have always used straw ropes and hemp threads to tie up goods. Since the invention of yarn ribbon, it has been used more widely because it is easy to use and has an aesthetic appearance. It has now become a necessity for stores. However, since the industry has always lacked organization and there is mutual infighting, Japanese merchants are taking advantage of the opportunity to implement their aggressive tactics. If we do not urgently rescue ourselves, the business will be inconceivable in the future, etc. After the report, the factory representatives began to discuss. They all said that the industry has no storefront and relies entirely on street vendors for sales. If Japanese merchants also use Chinese street vendors to sell, users will have difficulty identifying products and will inevitably be deceived. Therefore, to awaken users, there must first be a way to identify products. The discussion resulted in the following methods: 1. Advertise in the newspaper to encourage stores to use domestically produced products. 2. The association will make badges that all employees of the association's factories must wear when doing business with users, so as not to be confused with the Chinese street vendors used by Japanese merchants. 3. In the future, the products of each factory must have sufficient yardage and standardized prices, and</p>
<p>users must not be cheated on the yardage. This will change the industry's competition with each other to competition with Japanese goods, and will also generate interest in using domestically produced goods among members. 4. On the trademarks on the wooden strips at both ends of the products of the association's member factories, a seal issued by the association with the words "National Goods Completely Investigated by This Association" must be stamped, so that users can see at a glance that they are not Japanese goods. Once the association is formally established, the above procedures must be rushed, and it is heard that if each factory can strictly abide by these methods, users with a slight sense of patriotism will certainly abandon them and choose us, and Japanese yarn ribbon will be eliminated soon.</p>
<h3>Continued News on the Case of a Pedestrian Injured by a Bus on Connaught Road</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the case of a Chinese man, surnamed Shen, who was run over and killed by a British-owned bus on Connaught Road on the 7th, an investigation has revealed that the circumstances of the incident differ slightly from previous reports. The deceased's residence was very close to the scene of the accident. On the afternoon of the 7th, at around 6 PM, he was riding his bicycle from home, heading east on Connaught Road. He was originally following a certain bus. When he reached between numbers 373 and 5 on that road, he was suddenly struck from behind by the bus and fell into the road. At that moment, bus number 15007 was approaching from the opposite direction, heading west. Although the driver saw someone lying in the road, he did not pay attention. It wasn't until he was very close that he suddenly braked, but he still ran over the deceased's neck and chest, killing him instantly at the scene. The driver, realizing he had caused a fatal accident, immediately fled. Many passersby gathered to watch. The deceased's mother, Madam Shen Weng, arrived upon hearing the news, felt the cold body, and knew there was no saving him. She collapsed on the ground and wept bitterly. The location was on a road built beyond the concession boundary, so Chinese police arrived soon after. Seeing that a fatal accident had occurred, they immediately called a photographer to take pictures and preserve evidence, to prevent future disputes. When the concession police arrived after hearing the news, they were already unhappy that the Chinese police had arrived first. Moreover, the bus company representatives, seeing that the driver had fled for fear of punishment and that they would inevitably face significant compensation, listened to slanderous gossip, claiming that the deceased was not dead from the injuries and that the delay caused by the photography was responsible. They then preemptively questioned the Public Safety Bureau yesterday, so that the company and driver could shirk responsibility. It is now reported that the deceased's family has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the court to seek compensation and justice. It is also reported that the company has sent representatives to discuss compensation with the deceased's family for the past two days, hoping to reach a settlement. However, the deceased's family has learned that the driver had previously caused an accident and was sentenced to eight months in prison by the court. He had only been released for three days before causing another major accident. Such negligence cannot be left unpunished if justice is to be served for the deceased. Therefore, they have not yet agreed to a settlement. Since the event, many citizens have been paying attention to the matter. When necessary, a citizens' assembly will be held to discuss the case.</p>

<h3>New News from Paramount Grand Hotel</h3>
<p>Besides the dance and dining sections, which have already started operating, the hotel section of the Paramount Grand Hotel has also been fully prepared.

The arrangements in each room are different. The curtains and carpets, for example, are very elaborate. There are also regulations prohibiting the consumption of opium. It is expected that distinguished guests will definitely praise and cherish it. Also, Mr. Hao Si, the program director of the hotel's ballroom, said that the three Australian "hard-hitting" comedians and Mr. Zhai Kenuo, a famous British comedian, have been very popular since they started performing. Because of their exquisite dance skills, the audience of Mr. and Mrs. Yu Nabao are numerous every night, so the contract was renewed after the expiration of their term, and they continue to perform. The newly hired Wei sisters have also recovered, so they also start performing today (Friday). These sisters have enjoyed great fame in the United States. The hotel is very fortunate to have hired them. The songs they perform are fragrant, soft and harmonious, completely different from other kinds of singing, and can just change the taste of ladies from all walks of life.</p>

<h3>Huang Jin'di, Injured in the Collapse of a Building at the Ball Field, Has Died</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 24th of last month, at around 6 PM, the top of the three-story building of the Little Luzon hat shop and other buildings at the ball field on Nanjing Road and Henan Road was suddenly blown down by a hurricane. Bricks and cement fell with the wind, injuring three passersby. This was previously reported. However, one of them, named Huang Jin'di, 26 years old, from Wenzhou, who worked as a salesman at the Feibu Leather Shoe Store at No. 280 Jiangxi Road, was the most severely injured. The General Police Department ordered detectives to send him to Renji Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and he died in the hospital on the afternoon before yesterday. The body was taken to the Fei Lun Road mortuary. Yesterday morning, the First Special District District Court was notified, and Inspector Diao Chengtang, along with forensic doctors Bao and Zhang, secretary Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. First, Chinese patrol head Lu Dagong reported the results of the initial investigation. Then, Huang Yuting, the deceased's father, claimed that he lived at No. 57 Xinzha Road. His son was riding his bicycle home from the store on that day when he passed by the area and was suddenly struck by bricks. He was then sent to Renji Hospital by the police. After learning about it, he went to visit him. His son said that he felt severe pain in his abdomen. The doctor performed surgery and removed his kidney, but it was also ineffective. Later, he underwent another surgery and died yesterday afternoon. He requested permission to claim the body.

<h3>Various Circles Speculate on the Manufacturer of Guanghua Brand Cigarettes</h3>
<p>At a time when the promotion of domestic goods is sweeping across the country, the Chinese tobacco industry has an especially vigorous spirit.

<h3>The Huzhou Machine Weaving Workers' Strike is About to be Resolved: News from the Hu Society</h3>
<p>The Huzhou machine weaving workers initially had a labor dispute with the factory due to the issue of discounted wages. Later, because the local zero-machine workers resumed work first, the factory workers interfered, which led to another dispute between labor and labor, which evolved into the tragic case of the 3rd of this month. Because the matter is related to the hometown and the situation is serious, wires were sent to the Wuxing County government and the county chamber of commerce to inquire about the truth. Telegrams have been received from the county chamber of commerce to report everything. Yesterday, Dai, the county magistrate, sent a letter to Ling Songru, the director of the society, saying that two factories have resumed work since the 8th, and the number of factories ready to resume work immediately is quite large.

<p>The long-awaited latest production of the Star Film Company, "The Scandalous History of Mount Hua," directed by Cheng Bugao and starring Xu Lai, Gong Jianong, and Chen Ningqiu, will soon be released.  The entire film was shot on location at Mount Hua in the western part of the country, so the background is majestic and unique. The sea of clouds and strange rocks on the mountain can give people a sense of pleasure.  The story is also poignant and moving. The performances in the film are realistic and the light is clear. It is an excellent work following "Sister Flowers."  It is now scheduled to be screened day and night at the New Light Theater in this city starting tomorrow (14th).</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that the Yangtze River basin is cold and overcast, with a possibility of light rain. The weather in North China is gradually improving. From Shandong to Taiwan, there are seasonal winds from the north to northeast, which are quite strong. There is fog along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian. The low pressure has moved northeast. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 48.6, and the lowest was 43.0. On the same day last year, the highest was 60.8, and the lowest was 41.0.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Regarding the news in your newspaper on April 6th about the Xin Jiangtian steamboat encountering fog and nearly running aground, our ship actually departed from Shanghai for Ningbo on the 24th of last month (Saturday). Around 11:00 PM, we encountered heavy fog, but we had already passed the Greater and Lesser Zhiji Mountains at 10:45 PM. At 12:25 AM, the ship passed Yangshan. According to the fog signals from the various lighthouses (i.e., cannons fired every few minutes), we navigated in the dark. Because the Ningbo ships are on a regular schedule, we used them as a guide. Around 2:00 AM, the ship passed the Volcano W. Volcano lighthouse, but about seven miles southwest of Volcano is the Nando reef area. The usual route is to pass between these two. At this time, because the sea was heavily shrouded in fog and nothing could be seen, the ship anchored at 2:15 AM. The Sanbei Ningxing ship could not have seen us pass through in the heavy fog. After waiting until the fog cleared at 5:34 AM, we raised anchor and sailed south. At 8:40 AM, the ship arrived at Zhenhai. According to what your newspaper reported, it does not match the facts, so I am writing to clarify. I hope you will make the correction. Respectfully addressed to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao. He Hongyao, Captain of Xin Jiangtian, April 12th.</p>

<h3>Another Example of Studying International Issues (3)</h3>
<p>Therefore, in the recent international relations between Britain, America, and Japan, we can indeed find the basis for their sudden "reconciliation." This is certainly not "the clever rhetoric of international affairs commentators unwilling to admit defeat!"</p>
<p>However, if we only conduct such an investigation, it is ultimately insufficient. We find it too hollow and somewhat like reciting formulas, overly principled.</p>
<p>We should go a step further and examine how the relationships between the above three countries are reflected in the situation in China. Here, we see a struggle between two sets of lines: one is to maintain the principle of "open door" and "equal opportunity;" the other is to advocate the dismemberment of China. The current international situation has led to the victory of the latter line, forcing the United States to change its tough attitude at the time of the conclusion of the "Nine-Power Treaty" and instead seek a new direction for American interests. Partitioning China has become the unanimous current demand. Everyone wants to transfer the losses of the economic panic</p>
<p>to China, that is, to move from partitioning a semi-colony to temporarily alleviating the economic panic and reluctantly maintaining the dying breath of capitalism. Naturally, the United States abandoning its own line is a contradiction, but this contradiction is brought about by the current objective situation. Although this contradiction has not disappeared due to this change in the situation, it has been transferred to another situation, creating a new and greater contradiction. We should add this element to the above analysis.</p>
<p>At the same time, another way to break the economic panic and ease the war</p>
<p>terror among the capitalist classes is for everyone to unite against the Soviet Union. The Japanese-American compromise not only promoted the anti-Soviet war, but also, under this name, can actually conceal the anti-British significance of this compromise, reflecting a new kind of unity within imperialism, as if a true harmony among imperialists could be hoped for.</p>
<p>This is the basis for the emergence of this issue. However, how do we evaluate this compromise? We should have a correct and appropriate investigation into its occurrence, but what we should pay most attention to is not to forget that this compromise is a synthesis of many contradictions, and its development will change its direction with the movement of various contradictions in the world. For the time being, we cannot be as optimistic about the compromise between Japan and the United States as they are themselves, nor can we immediately believe that the current combination of Japan and the United States necessarily determines that Japan and the United States will stand in one camp in the future world war, and that the development of this situation will inevitably lead to a showdown between the British and American mainstays, rather than a struggle between the United States and Japan in the Pacific. Nor can we immediately say that the current situation will inevitably develop into an anti-Soviet war, and will not take the road of mutual infighting among imperialists again. Because these changes will be completely determined by other changes in forces and the balance of power, they cannot be speculated out of thin air. Here we can only recognize that this compromise creates greater contradictions, and the future will inevitably lead to war, and there can be no peaceful optimism. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn Annals</p>
<h3>Misty Record of Royal Incense</h3>
<p>— Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, as far as I know, in fact, he often disregards the opinions contributed to him by his courtiers; especially those words that contradict his own opinions, he is even more unwilling to listen to! This time, in order to obey the custom, he had no choice but to issue a routine edict, but after this edict was issued, the courtiers were greatly flustered, and memorials were sent in like snowflakes. The gist of their opinions was nothing more than the following words...</p>
<p>"I humbly believe that since Yao and Shun in China, emperors of all dynasties have never heard of lightly entrusting the dignity of the Son of Heaven to trains that are like wind and lightning, full of dangers; moreover, our Empress Dowager is advanced in years, and should especially cherish herself, so as to comfort the hopes of the people... Even the various affairs in the court depend on the sacred will for decisions, and cannot be abandoned for a single day. Therefore, your ministers sincerely hope that our Empress Dowager will not be deceived by the sorcery of foreigners, and will dismiss the Eastern tour. This is the best course of action!" The so-called "sorcery of foreigners" probably refers to me and my sister.</p>
<p>During the twenty days of our preparations for departure, there were almost always such memorials sent in every day, but the Empress Dowager ignored them all, tore them into pieces at will, and scattered them all over the ground. This is also his habit, whenever he sees a memorial that contradicts his own opinion, he always tears it up like this! He also said angrily...</p>
<p>"Just because the emperors of the past have not taken trains, can't we take them now? If there had been trains at that time, they would have taken them long ago! And even if there is any danger, we are not afraid! Can we say that we have experienced few dangerous things? What is especially annoying is that these slaves dare to say that I am old!"</p>

<h3>Siamese Tangerines</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>These days, Siamese tangerines occupy the largest position in the fruit market. Almost every fruit store displays Siamese tangerines with thick peels and orange-yellow color.</p>
<p>What is the relationship between Siam and our country? How does Siam treat our overseas Chinese? How will Siam fare in the future world situation? Is it worth it for us to promote and consume their tangerines? These questions are too big, and we are not qualified to offer opinions. However, in this year of national goods, when the sound of the national goods movement still maintains a considerable height, we watch the copper coins, dimes, and silver dollars in the pockets of masters, young masters, wives, grandmothers, officials, and young ladies being generously handed over to the fruit store owner, and then handed over by the fruit store owner to the producers of Siamese tangerines. This kind of relationship through several hands, if carefully chewed, may be somewhat different from the taste of Siamese tangerines, right? In fact, in China, along the rivers and coasts, almost every province produces tangerines. Why can't Guangtangerines and Futangerines compare to those of others? Tiantai Mountain tangerines are even thinner-skinned, juicier, and sweeter than Siamese tangerines. Sichuan and Hubei also produce tangerines, but they are not well-known. The seedless small tangerines produced in Nanfeng, Jiangxi, are also not well known, but they are better than any kind of tangerine.</p>
<p>In this year of promoting national goods, I believe that we should advance on many fronts simultaneously, so that we can achieve the effect of using our arms and fingers. Siamese tangerines seem to be a small problem, but we should pay some attention to it.</p>
<h3>Skirts and Qipao Corners</h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>In various "newspaper butts," we can often see writers using their sharp pens to satirize people's official positions, which they obtained through nepotism. However, skirts are unique to women, and they have long been eliminated with the changes of the times. Nowadays, whether in modern women or middle-aged women, it is rare to see them wearing skirts in the city. Only a few old women in the countryside wear skirts.</p>
<p>Instead of talking about skirts, it is better to change the term to "qipao corners" to be more appropriate and more in line with the trend. Indeed, women and women now wear qipaos, and it is more modern to talk about "qipao corners."</p>
<p>Women's power is indeed not small, and there are indeed many who have obtained prominent positions by going through back channels.</p>
<p>To be honest... "As long as you hold on to her qipao corner tightly,</p>
<p>she goes east, and you get to go east too; she goes west, and you get to go west too. Otherwise, if you let go, your position will definitely not be secure."</p>
<p>Looking at it, there are many people who have grabbed hold of her qipao corner</p>
<p>, and they have endless food and clothing, and they are even more smug. Speaking of their abilities, holding on to qipao corners is their specialty.</p>
<h3>Biography of Auntie in the Front Building</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>With a "Sister-in-law in the Back Building," there is of course also an "Auntie in the Front Building." The sister-in-law in the back building plays mahjong and touches cards, living happily and carefree! The auntie in the front building, however, actually uses classical language, and is actually an uncrowned scholar!</p>
<p>The auntie in the front building, her surname and name are unknown. Some call her auntie, and everyone agrees, so they use this as her name!</p>
<p>"Closing the door pushes out the moon in front of the window, throwing a stone shatters the sky under the water."</p>
<p>She can fluently recite the verses of Su Xiaomei and Qin Shaoyou, and she sometimes even sets questions for people to answer... This question is very interesting! It's called "A bird by the river with the character 'Hong'," but people are stumped and cannot answer it!</p>
<p>The auntie loves pipi silk cigarettes and rolled cigarettes! Blowing smoke, the chatterbox starts! "Mr. Meng Zhao, let's talk about the Romance of the Eastern Zhou Kingdoms, what? 'A man in the reeds... With a jeweled sword around his waist with seven stars, not recording the time of crossing the river, with rice and fish soup...' Speaking of Wu Zixu is as vivid as a picture, I echo in a rambling voice, respectfully with tea and cigarettes, often talking until the middle of the night, without getting tired. My wife also listens intently, saying, 'How can there be such a talented woman in the storytelling arena?'"</p>
<p>I say that the auntie in the front building is truly a strong character, so I am writing a biography for her!</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Games</h3>
<h3>Naturalization</h3>
<p>— Qian Yun</p>
<p>Foreigners chew sugarcane like playing the flute in a straight line, but Chinese people are more like playing the dizi, much more freehand. After chewing, they spit it out casually, extremely naturalized and artistic; for example, an Indian eats sugarcane from Three Horse Road to Four Horse Road, and also spits it out to Four Horse Road. It is best for the street sweepers in red vests to follow behind!</p>
<p>A movie theater posted a notice... "Please do not bring in fruit peels or the like!" This is not yet an effective method, and there should be a garbage can and a spittoon in each seat, with the words "Pour garbage into the can, spit into the spittoon!" Should we exhaust the small five carts again? Do as you please.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 27 The Boudoir Darkly Dispels Kind Thoughts, Sadness Arises After Drunkenness, Old Events Are Hard to Forget</p>
<p>When they arrived in the house, naturally, what she paid attention to first were Zhao Ziqiang and those who accompanied him. Really, both father and son were kind and honest people, and would never be devious towards others. It is said that people's hearts can be exchanged, and she should not have any ulterior motives towards such a husband and father-in-law. She was staring blankly at those accompanying her in the house when she heard Zhao Weng call out from outside... "Xiaomei, quickly boil a pot of water and make chrysanthemum tea for the young mistress." "Guizhi, can't you put in eye drops yourself? Please ask your old lady to put them in for you, how about that?" Guizhi had no eye disease at all, so why put in eye drops? She replied... "Old master, I have already put them in." Zhao Weng said... "Is it a little spicy? It will be cool and refreshing in a while." As he spoke, he walked to the edge of the door curtain. Guizhi was afraid that her father-in-law would see through her disguise, so she immediately leaned on the table, not daring to raise her head. Zhao Weng said... "Guizhi, do you eat lamb liver? I'll buy some lamb liver tonight and stew it for you to eat. That stuff is the brightest for the eyes." Guizhi said... "No need to bother, by the afternoon, my illness will be better." Zhao Weng said... "You lie down, I'm going out for a walk." Guizhi leaned on the table and listened until Zhao Weng's footsteps went out of the front yard before she dared to raise her head. In her heart, she felt that the old man's thoughtfulness was so great that even if her own father was still alive, he probably couldn't be so kind. Both father and son are so kind-hearted, and speaking superstitiously, there should not be any bad consequences? After deciding on this point, relying on her conscience, she should endure it. After she made this plan, she felt at ease in her heart. It was not because of the eye that was swollen from illness that it got better in the afternoon. From that night on, Guizhi, being judged by her own conscience, no longer had wild thoughts, and her eyes would no longer hurt. However, although her fake illness was gone, a real illness was slowly coming. At first, she felt a little tired, then she felt depressed, only wanting to sleep, and after a while, she felt nauseous.

<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<h3>Research on Inkstones (20) (1)</h3>
<p>— Bored Guest</p>
<p>Overview of Chengni Inkstones</p>
<p>㈠ The Origin of Chengni Inkstones: According to previous records, there are about three theories about the origin of Chengni inkstones... 1. Guo Prefecture Chengni inkstones: Mi Shi said that Guo inkstones are fine, purple, and lovely, do not seep ink, and have a muddy fragrance when grinding ink. The Tang people considered them to be the best. 2. Ze Prefecture Chengni inkstones: Oupu said that the Ze Prefecture Jin Daoren Chengni inkstones have the character "Lu" on them, are firm and can be tested for ink. Mi Shi also said that Ze pottery inkstones are made of mud of different colors with the character "Lu" on them, both inside and outside; (Lu is Lu Daoren). 3. Jiang Prefecture Chengni inkstones: Supu said that the people of Jiang collect mud in the Fen River for more than a year, and then make it into inkstones, and the water does not dry up. Which of these three kinds of Chengni came first? It is already impossible to investigate. Only the Chengni of Jiang Prefecture can still be investigated for its manufacturing method. According to Wenfang Sipu, "The people of Jiang County, Shanxi, are good at making Chengni inkstones. They put the mud in a silk bag and place it in the Fen River. After more than a year, the mud will fill the bag. Or they use a cloth bag to hold the clay and swing it in the water to get the fine mud, then remove the clear water, let it dry slightly, add yellow dan, and knead it like dough. Put it in a mold, press it firmly, and use a bamboo knife to carve the shape of the inkstone. After it is slightly dry, use a sharp knife to smooth it, expose it to dry, and then put rice bran and yellow cow dung into the kiln and fire it for a period of time. Then, add ink wax and steam it with rice vinegar for five to seven times, which is no less than stone." The method of manufacturing Chengni inkstones that can be investigated is like this. Later, the Song people tried to visit to make them. Yan Jian quoted Oupu as saying that the method of making Chengni inkstones is rarely known. At that time, there was a writing assistant, Liu Yisou, who made them according to the spectrum method, and they were excellent. I got two of them, one was given to Liu Yuanfu, and the other was placed in the Zhongshu Pavilion as a treasure. Now the scholar-officials do not study calligraphy, rarely use pen and ink, and only this kind of inkstone is seen in the world. It can be seen that this kind of good inkstone made of pottery, even those imitated by the Song Dynasty, is still rare, let alone those from the Tang Dynasty? Recently, there have been many Chengni inkstones seen, most of which are rough and hurt the brush, and they are all imitations made by people after the Yuan and Ming dynasties.</p>
<p>㈡ Old Chengni Inkstones are divided into three grades: Tang Shi's Inkstone Said, "Potters use river and sea sand and soil to match and fire into inkstones in the kiln. The best one is called eel yellow, the second is green head sand, and the third is rose purple."</p>
<p>Eel Yellow: The color is like the belly of an eel, with fire yellow being the most valuable; Green Head Sand: The color is light blue-black, also known as crab shell blue;</p>
<p>Rose Purple: There are two kinds, light red and dark red.</p>
<p>The dark red one is called shrimp head red by the Japanese, because its color is pleasing to the eye and very rare, so the Japanese treasure it the most and buy it at a high price. However, the preciousness of Chengni lies in the fineness and smoothness of the quality, not in the color. Furthermore, this kind of Chengni has spots like beans on the yellow color. The larger ones are broad bean sand, and the smaller ones are green bean sand. Those that have them all produce ink, just like the Duanshi with eyes are valuable. There is also a kind that has fine sand and black halo several layers, and its value is the same as the beautiful pattern of Duanshi.</p>
<p>In the past, there was also the name of five-color Chengni. People often thought that it was a general term for inkstones of various colors, but in fact, there was indeed another kind of five-color Chengni inkstone. I have a large Chengni inkstone, which looks like crab shell blue on the surface, but if you look at it from the side, you can vaguely see several layers of yellow, red, and black. It can indeed be called a five-color Chengni. In short, the Chengni inkstones that are valued by the literati must be old inkstones from the Tang and Song dynasties. The mud is all taken from the water, extremely clean and fine, and the pottery is also made in a very proper way, so it does not dry and also does not hurt the brush. If the inkstones imitated by later generations are only for the use of vulgar officials and craftsmen, or for scholars to carry with them to take exams, which is beneficial to rapid concentration in the wind.</p>

<h3>National Sports Association Announces Preliminary Selection Order for Track and Field and Basketball</h3>
<p>Track and Field Individual Events Can Be Completed in One Day Tomorrow</p>
<p>Basketball Except for North China, Preliminary Round Robin Tournament First</p>
<p>Our country's track and field and basketball preliminary selections for participation in the Far Eastern Games are scheduled to be held starting tomorrow. Athletes from various places will arrive in Shanghai one after another. The order of the two preliminary selections has been arranged and announced by the National Sports Association. However, it has been raining for several days, which is very worrying. It is still difficult to determine whether they can be held as scheduled. It is expected that many new national records will be produced in this track and field competition, but the weather is not good, which will inevitably be greatly affected. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Basketball Order This competition is for reference for the selection of the representative team, and is different from the nature of ordinary championship competitions. The selection is based on individual skills, and has nothing to do with the team's victory or defeat. I hope everyone will pay attention to this. The order of the competition is based on the North China team occupying the seat of the basic team, and then facing the challenge week. The order is as follows (postponed in case of rain):</p>
<p>Shanghai vs. Hubei 7:00 PM on the 14th Referee: Dong Shouyi</p>
<p>Shanghai vs. Nanjing 7:00 PM on the 15th Referee: Zhang Guoxun Nanjing vs. Hubei 7:00 PM on the 16th Referee: Shu Hong The winning team of the above round robin tournament will compete with the North China team in the finals. The date is tentatively scheduled for the 17th. If the scores are the same in the round robin tournament, the competition will be restarted on the 17th.

<h3>Beijing Far Eastern Games Athletes Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th) The Beijing track and field and basketball athletes participating in the Far Eastern Games preliminary selections, a group of sixteen people, led by Zhang Dongping and Wu Xingmao, left for Shanghai from Beijing at 9:00 AM on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Continues to Float the Idea of Not Participating in the Far East Games; Claims Situation is Easing; Leaving Room for Future Maneuvering; Sets Deadline for Philippines to Respond to Questions</h3>
<p>A telegram from Tokyo reveals continuous attempts to float the idea that Japan is displaying a strong attitude about halting participation in the upcoming Far East Games. This includes various forms of intimidation and threats. It was always clear that this was a tactic to pressure the Philippines. Now, a telegram from Tokyo suddenly states that the situation is easing. The reason given is consideration for Japan's international standing, avoiding rash actions, and leaving room for future maneuvering.</p>
<p>Halted Participation Idea Eases Again (Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 12th) The Japan Athletic Association held a committee meeting at 6:00 PM on the 11th to discuss Japan's attitude towards the upcoming Far Eastern Games. Some committee members initially expressed strong opinions, indignant at the Philippines' breach of faith, leading to a strong atmosphere of Japan withdrawing from the Games. However, Association advisor Yota Sugimura voiced his opinion that Japan should consider its international standing and avoid rash actions. He argued that hasty decisions could endanger Japan's international position. Many representatives from various groups agreed with Sugimura, and the tense atmosphere eased slightly. As a result of continued discussions, it was decided to demand that the Philippines reflect on their attitude and await their official response before making a final decision.</p>
<p>An Ultimatum-Style Questionnaire (Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 12th) The Athletic Association selected an eight-person executive committee, including Sugimura and Ogawa, to draft a telegram to the Philippine Athletic Association. The Association authorities publicly announced the following at 11:00 PM on the 11th:</p>
<p>Today's committee meeting had many members in favor of halting participation in the Far East Games. However, we believe the only appropriate course of action is to send a telegram to the Philippine Athletic Association, demanding they reflect on their actions before we decide on our final course. The content of the telegram is as follows: The Japan Athletic Association, from the beginning, has considered the issue of the pseudo-organization's participation in the Far East Games in a purely sporting spirit, without any political considerations. This is a well-known fact. The Japan Athletic Association, based on the trust and friendship of the Philippines, spared no expense in actively preparing for the pseudo-organization's participation. Representative Yamamoto reported from Manila that an understanding had been reached between the Japanese and Philippine representatives. When the issue of the pseudo-organization's participation could be realized by majority vote, the Japanese side felt extremely satisfied. However, the results of the Shanghai Round Table Conference were completely contrary to our hopes, which was truly unexpected. From a sporting point of view, the pseudo-organization certainly has the qualifications to participate. However, to disregard the current state of the pseudo-organization and prevent it from participating is a betrayal of the sporting spirit. The Japan Athletic Association hereby requests that the Philippine Athletic Association seriously consider this point and reflect on their attitude. Japan will decide on a major course of action based on the Philippine side's attitude. Please reply with a definite opinion by noon on the 14th of this month.</p>
<p>Resolutions of the Japan Athletic Association Board of Directors (Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 12th) The resolutions of the Athletic Association Board of Directors are as follows: ⑴ The Board of Directors and the Preparatory Committee's handling of this matter is approved. This includes approving the notification to the Post Office Company and Takashimaya to halt preparations for participation. ⑴ It is approved to continue this approach until a decision is received from the Philippine side to reverse their decision on participation.</p>
<p>Philippine Athletic Association Explains Attitude to Japan (Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 12th) The Vice President of the Philippine Athletic Association, Vargas, telegraphed Florentino, the General Manager of the Manila News Union currently in Tokyo, on the 11th to express the attitude of the Philippine Athletic Association. The telegram stated that he has always held the Japanese people and country in high regard. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that the friendly relationship between Japan and the Philippines can be maintained. However, under the current regulations, the Philippine Athletic Association cannot deviate from the attitude adopted at the Shanghai Round Table Conference. Under the current regulations, the Philippine Athletic Association must adopt a policy of requiring unanimous consent for new member participation. However, at the Far East Games Committee meeting to be held in Manila, the Philippine representative will gladly support revising the current charter to adopt a majority vote system in place of the unanimous consent system. We previously agreed with Dr. Yamamoto to realize this matter, and we will not hesitate to fulfill this agreement now.</p>
<p>(Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 12th) An official of the Japan Athletic Association told reporters that the unofficial statement released by the Philippine representative today differs from the content of Dr. Yamamoto's report. We are determined to maintain Yamamoto's words and actions throughout.</p>
<h3>Philippines Prepares to Respond to Japanese Protest; Executive Committee Meeting to be Held Tomorrow to Discuss</h3>
<p>(Kokumin Newspaper, Manila, 12th) The Philippine Amateur Athletic Association received a telegram today from the Japan Amateur Athletic Association protesting the Shanghai Round Table Conference's resolution to postpone the decision on the "pseudo-state's request to participate in the Far East Games." The protest also stated that Japan's sole purpose is to maintain and promote pure sport, without any political motives. The association requested that the Philippine association consider the matter and provide a definite final opinion on the pseudo-state issue by noon on April 14. After receiving the Japanese protest, the President of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association, Dr. Baca, immediately notified the Executive Committee to convene a meeting at 9:00 AM on Saturday to discuss all matters.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Sends Telegram Firmly Rejecting Pseudo-State Participation in Far East Games; Wang Zhengting Returns to Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) The Ministry of Education sent a telegram to the National Athletic Association on the 12th stating:)</p>
<p>We firmly reject the pseudo-organization's participation in the Far East Games.</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Zhengting, the Chief Representative of China's participation in the Far East Games, arrived in Shanghai by the Shanghai-Pinglian Transport Train at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to prepare for the preliminary selection. The train is scheduled to arrive in port at 7:55 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Remarks by Education Vice Minister Duan Xipeng (Nanjing, 12th) Education Vice Minister Duan Xipeng said that China's representatives to the Far East Games would never associate with the puppet Manchuria. The Japanese side's proposal has clearly exceeded the scope of the round table conference. If, by any chance, member countries accommodate the Japanese side's proposal and agree to the pseudo-state's participation in the competition, and it is passed unanimously, China's representatives will immediately declare their withdrawal. He believes that member countries, in order to safeguard international morality, will not agree to the Japanese side's proposal.</p>

<h3>Key Points for Improving Education in Qingdao City; Report of the Ministry of Education Commissioner's Inspection</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent personnel to inspect education in Qingdao City. The inspection results have been reported to the Ministry of Education. The report's recommendations for improving education in Qingdao City are detailed below:</p>
<p>⑴ The organization of the Qingdao City Education Bureau is generally satisfactory. The two supervisors and three staff members, who are responsible for the five rural districts and provide constant guidance, are particularly appropriate. However, if the General Affairs Section can be streamlined and the School Education Section expanded, replacing the original two sections of School Education Administration and School Education Design with two sections of Primary Education and Secondary Education, the efficiency of the office will certainly be increased.</p>
<p>⑵ In the past three years, the city's education funding has increased by more than 30,000 yuan each year. However, in order to consolidate the existing educational foundation and ensure stable development in the future, education funding should be secured independently. The percentage of various expenditures should also be carefully determined in accordance with the Ministry's orders.</p>
<p>⑶ The city's policy of exempting students from tuition fees in municipal schools is satisfactory. The Qingdao City Education Bureau is now considering a plan to charge tuition fees in order to expand the source of education funds. This is feasible in secondary schools, but primary schools, normal schools, vocational schools, and female students at all levels should continue to be exempted.</p>
<p>⑷ Two-thirds of the city's school-age children are not in school. The number of places or classes should be expanded immediately. The number of girls enrolled is not high, so encouragement should be increased.</p>
<p>⑸ The reorganization and restructuring of public and private secondary schools in the city should be carried out in accordance with Instructions No. 489 of the Ministry.</p>
<p>⑹ The city's primary and secondary school buildings are quite solid and beautiful. Future construction should pay attention to whether the school site is appropriate, whether the architectural style is suitable, and whether the classroom capacity is prepared for expanding the number of students.</p>
<p>(7) Although teaching equipment in schools has increased year by year, it is still inevitably simple. The City Education Bureau should formulate a concrete plan for enriching the content of each school to the minimum extent possible and realize it within the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(8) Primary school teachers should be hired who understand the local situation, can use Mandarin, and are enthusiastic about local education.</p>
<p>(9) The scope of the examination questions should examine the teaching materials taught in each school year, and should not hastily determine that the materials in the third school year should account for two-thirds of the proportion.</p>
<p>(10) The four proposed scholarship regulations are well-intentioned, but should be put into practice. The amount of loans and types of free education for poor and talented students in secondary schools should be further specified.</p>
<p>(11) The city's social education has been quite successful, but it is more appropriate for local people to be in charge of mass education work. The admission qualifications for the social education staff training class may be relaxed, and each district and public agency may send a reasonable number of students.</p>
<p>(12) The promotion of mass education can be carried out in conjunction with the local party headquarters to increase its working power. The curriculum of women's supplementary schools should focus on vocational training in order to meet the needs of practical life.</p>
<p>(13) The national inspection of film work is under the unified management of the central government and does not belong to the scope of local education administration. The City Education Bureau's film inspection organization should be abolished immediately to emphasize the rule of law.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Commissioner's Inspection Standards in Peiping; Focus on the Number of Students in Class and Administrative Equipment; A List of Universities to be Inspected Throughout the Country in the Future</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) After the Ministry of Education inspectors Liu Yingshi, Guo Youshou, Chen Kezhong, and Sun Guofeng left Peiping for Baoding, they inspected the Hebei Provincial Agricultural College and investigated the administration of the Hebei Provincial Medical College. Then, they will inspect Kaifeng, Changsha, Wuhan, and Anhui in order. Inspector Zhou Tianfang did not go to Baoding for inspection because he was handling Northeast youth relief affairs in Peiping. It is found that the inspectors stayed in Peiping for the longest time, and their inspection standards are particularly important. When Liu Yingshi and others first arrived in Peiping, the reporter inquired about this point. Liu did not give a concrete answer because it was inconvenient to publish before the inspection. The universities and specialized schools in Peiping are very concerned about their standards. The reporter has now inquired from all parties and obtained concrete results. The list of colleges and universities to be inspected by each inspector in the future is also listed below.</p>
<h3>Inspection Standards</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education's inspection in Peiping was quite thorough. The inspection standards of each inspector are unknown to outsiders. Because the task of each inspector has been completed, the reporter specially inquired from the relevant parties and obtained the truth. The inspection standards are listed separately as follows: ⑴ In terms of classrooms, 1. Investigate whether the number of students attending matches the number registered. 2. Whether the materials taught by the teachers are suitable for the students' level. Therefore, each inspector stood next to the students during the inspection and observed their notes. 3. Investigate what kind of textbooks the teachers are using. If the students have books, check whether the books used by the students are the books taught by the teachers. If the students do not have books, inspect their notes and browse the teachers' books. ⑵ In terms of registration, 1. Whether the number of teacher and student absences matches the registration. 2. Statistics of teacher and student absences. 3. Whether the test papers are written outside the classroom, and whether the teachers strictly grade the papers. At the same time, measure the students' level. 4. Whether the entrance examination is strictly held. It is said that a small number of universities in Peiping have no entrance examination papers at all. ⑶ In terms of accounting, 1. Check the difference between the budget and the final account. 2. Budget and final account allocation. Whether the distribution of funds between the departments is reasonable. 3. The number of salaries of professors and lecturers, whether it matches the name and reality. 4. Whether the library fees and sports fees paid by students are used to add books or purchase sports equipment. ⑷ In terms of general affairs, 1. The number of school workers, treatment, and allocation of work. 2. What parts are managed by the general affairs department, and how is the scope of work defined? ⑸ In terms of dormitory affairs, 1. Health and hygiene equipment. 2. The percentage of students living on campus. Because this point is related to management. 3. The equipment is related to the school's funding. If the equipment is simple, there is a place for sympathy, but it must be observed whether it is doing what it can. ⑹ In terms of the laboratory, 1. Whether the instruments are decorations or are actually used. 2. Whether the instruments prepared are suitable for basic training or are only for specialized research. This inspection focuses on the basic application of schools lacking funds. 3. Whether the equipment fees match the facts. ⑺ Library, 1. Whether the books are needed for teaching, whether they focus on teacher reference or student reading. 2. Whether the price of the books matches the library fees, whether it matches the report of the accounting department. 3. The purchase of magazines, (A) Whether there are more free gifts or more purchases, (B) Whether there are more retail purchases or more subscriptions, (C) Whether there are more complete sets or more incomplete sets.</p>
<h3>Colleges and Universities Inspected</h3>
<p>The colleges and universities inspected by the inspectors in the future are also of concern to the education sector. The investigation is as follows: ⑴ In Baoding, inspect all parts of Hebei Provincial Agricultural College and the administrative part of Hebei Provincial Medical College. According to the Ministry of Education inspector Pang Jingzhou, he had previously gone to Baoding to inspect Hebei Provincial Medical College. The inspection was entirely for the medical aspects of specialization and the subjects, and did not investigate the administrative aspects. Now, Liu Yingshi and others are going to inspect the administrative part. ⑵ In Kaifeng, inspect the Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Agriculture, and Faculty of Medicine of Henan University. It is scheduled to inspect for two days. ⑶ In Wuhan, inspect the various faculties of National Wuhan University and the various faculties of Private Wenhua University. It is scheduled to inspect for three days. ⑷ In Changsha, inspect Hunan University and Xiangya Medical College. It is scheduled to inspect for two days. Note: The inspectors will decide temporarily whether to proceed from Kaifeng to Wuhan first or to Changsha first. ⑸ In Anqing, inspect the various faculties of Anhui University. The inspectors departed from Beijing on March 6 to inspect various places. It was originally planned to return to Beijing to report on April 20, but due to the spring break in northern universities, it had to be postponed.</p>

<h3>The Chinese School Advancement Association will hold a Chinese Language Competition on the 18th of this month at the Provincial Shanghai Middle School. It is also preparing for a Teaching Seminar for English Teachers.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Secondary School Advancement Association, in order to promote students' extracurricular activities and increase students' interest in research, has decided to hold a Chinese language competition at the Junior High School Department of the Provincial Shanghai Middle School in Xiaoximen at 2:00 PM on April 18. Each school will recommend two representatives from the high school and junior high school levels to participate in the competition. A letter has been sent to Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, to ask him to set the topic. It is reported that the association will also hold an English recitation competition at Wuben Girls' Middle School on the afternoon of May 10, and a teaching seminar for English teachers at 1:00 PM on May 21.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Association participates in the New Life Movement Lantern Festival, and letters are sent to all district education associations to participate together.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association has scheduled a lantern festival for the 15th of this month. Yesterday, the Municipal Education Association sent letters to all district education associations to participate together. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Greetings, The Shanghai New Life Movement Lantern Festival is scheduled to be held at the Public Stadium of Daji Road, Ximen, at 6:00 PM on the 15th of this month. Our association has prepared various kinds of lanterns and decorations. At that time, we hope that all the staff of your association will participate, and please send a letter to our association to collect the lanterns. In addition, the association has also sent letters to various popular schools to participate.</p>
<h3>The Philippine Scout Association Coerces Chinese Scouts. The Shanghai Scout Council requests the General Association to negotiate.</h3>
<p>In the past two or three years, the Chinese Boy Scouts in the Philippines have been repeatedly coerced by the local American Boy Scout branch to be placed under their control. First, a letter was sent to the Chinese Boy Scout authorities in the Philippines stating that all foreign Boy Scouts in the Philippines should register with them and be subject to their jurisdiction. Then, a staff member was sent to warn the Chinese Consul General in the Philippines that if the Chinese Boy Scouts in the Philippines did not accept their organization, all organizations of the Chinese Boy Scouts in the Philippines would be banned and disbanded within one month. At that time, Mr. Wu Zongmu, the instructor of the Chinese Boy Scouts in the Philippines, replied with a letter requesting instructions from the Chinese Boy Scout Headquarters as a compromise. Since then, the case has been pending for more than a year. On March 7 of this year, Mr. Voss, the director of the Philippine branch of the American Boy Scouts, sent another letter to Mr. Wu, citing Article 6 of the regulations resolved at the Fifth World Boy Scout Conference in 1929 (translated as "The Boy Scout General Association of the country of residence has the right to disband foreign Boy Scouts"). He demanded that they register, pay fees, and be subject to their control. The Chinese Boy Scout community in the Philippines considered the matter to be of great importance and convened a meeting of all Chinese Boy Scout group leaders in Manila on March 9, and immediately resolved the following: (1) Report to the Chinese Boy Scout General Association for instructions on how to deal with the matter, and find out whether the 1929 World Boy Scout Regulations have been changed to date. (2) Article 6 of the regulations is considered to interfere with the administration of the Chinese Boy Scouts and cannot be accepted. The above situation has been reported to the Nanjing and Shanghai Boy Scout communities by Mr. Wu Zongmu, the instructor of the Chinese Boy Scouts in the Philippines. After hearing the news, the Shanghai Boy Scout Council submitted it to the 22nd Council Meeting for discussion, and it was resolved to forward the situation to the Boy Scout General Association and then to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the American authorities, and to send a letter to the Chinese Boy Scouts in the Philippines to express sympathy. Since the Chinese Boy Scouts have not yet officially joined as a member of the World Boy Scout Conference, whether our country's Boy Scouts must comply with the World Boy Scout Regulations is obviously a problem. From an objective standpoint, if the Chinese Boy Scouts in foreign countries should be subject to the control of the country of residence, then the foreign Boy Scouts in China should not be few. The Chinese Boy Scouts can also order the foreign Boy Scouts in China to register with our General Association to show reciprocity. This is an obvious truth.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Association's Popular School held graduations for the first and second sessions at fifteen schools.</h3>

The inspection of the above schools last month has been completed within days, and the results of each school are good, especially the first and eighteenth schools, which are considered to be more outstanding.</p>
<h3>Zhengshi Middle School will build its own school building.</h3>
<p>Zhengshi Middle School, located on Shanzhong Road in the French Concession of this port, was founded by Mr. Du Yuesheng. The principal is Mr. Chen Renhe. Since its opening, three years have passed in an instant. Due to the seriousness of the teaching and the strictness of the management, the school affairs have been thriving. However, the school buildings of the school have always been rented. Although a building has been added this year, it is still not enough to meet the needs. It is reported that Mr. Fan Huichun, a director of the school, enthusiastically donated a piece of land for the construction of a new school building. The land is located at the intersection of Ma Yushan Road, Yinxiang Township, North Shanghai, and has a total of fifteen mu or so. Yesterday, people were sent to erect boundary markers, and Mr. Du and the school directors jointly donated huge sums of money to build the school building. Construction will begin within days, and it is expected that it will be fully completed in August of this year. The school will be able to move into the new school building in the next semester.</p>

In addition, the institute's sole purpose is to promote culture and serve society, so the tuition fee is low, and there are no free scholarships.

<h3>The decline in silver prices fuels a five-dollar increase in gold prices.</h3>
<p>The gold market was stirred up yesterday by the fall in silver prices. The news improved midway and was even higher. The result was stable. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in England and the United States were flat, and the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange fell by as much as 3.5 to 4.5 cents (the market opened higher because the Senate Agricultural Association passed the Jones Silver Act, but the result was the opposite, and people's hearts were better). Exchange rates were flat, London spot gold rose by 4.5 pence, American cotton fell by 10 points, and American wheat shrank by 2.5. The wool market opened and immediately rose to 56 or 57 yuan. After the market opened, the market was flat and sluggish, because Reuters reported that senators in the US Senate who were attached to silver as the national currency had begun to regroup to try to pass the Jones Silver Act and the Thomas amendment to nationalize silver as soon as possible. Now they are only waiting for Senator Wheeler to return to Washington before starting action. The Central Bank opened for cash, and the exchange rate market tightened and stabilized. Later, the Associated Press reported that most people in the US government opposed silver purchase proposals and were looking for ways to obstruct them, and the Xinfeng Foreign Firm private telegram said that the Jones proposal might pass in the Senate, but the president would still find it difficult to agree. People's hearts were shaken, and the gold price rose. The afternoon closing was slightly flat, and the gold price fell slightly in the after-market due to the uncertainty of the exchange rate market, but the banks were still buying forward contracts, so the price was low but still high, and the situation was mostly volatile. For half a day, the overall trend hovered around 7 yuan. The price of red gold was 967 yuan. I will record the market situation for the day below.</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 955 yuan and 7 jiao, up 3.5 yuan from the previous closing. Goods opened at 5 yuan and 8 jiao. The exchange rate market opened with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 1875, and American exchange at 34 yuan 875. The market was quite stable at the beginning. Banks bought American dollars for August at 4375. Hengyu, Zhengchang, Yuanchun, etc. entered at 6 yuan and 6 jiao. Shanghai bought American dollars for August at 375. It was known that HSBC would not move the list price. Tianfeng, Yingfeng, Heng, Hengyu, Zhifeng, and Yong sold at 5 yuan and 8 jiao. Mitsui bought American dollars for September at half a yuan. Mackary bought August at 375. Ruikang, Yuqing, Yongyuan, Yizhaofengchang, Hengyu, etc. all entered and rose to 7 yuan. Goods Zhaofengchang, Yuqing, and Yong sold, and retreated to 6 yuan and 1 jiao. However, because the Central Bank opened for cash,</p>
<p>Yingfeng Heng purchased and was still stable. Later, the market news was favorable, and the Zhu market was tense. Qianchang, Xiangsheng, Dahengchang, Yongheng, Taifu, and Yu successively purchased. Mitsui bought American dollars for July at 1875, August at 3125, and September at 4375, gradually rising to 8 yuan and 3 jiao. Hengxing, Yuanyi, Fuan, Zhifeng, Yong, etc. took the opportunity to sell at a high price, and the exchange rate market was slightly flat, and then retreated to 6 yuan and 9 jiao. The afternoon closing was 957 yuan and 1 jiao, and goods were sold at 7 yuan and 3 jiao.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 957 yuan and 5 jiao, and goods opened at the same price. Under the strong selling of Fuchang, Zhengchang, and Qianchang, it retreated from 7 yuan and 6 jiao to 6 yuan and 4 jiao. Da Ying came out with American dollars for July at 1875. Then, because Mitsui bought American dollars for September at half a yuan, Xie Kang, Zhifeng, and Yong entered, rising to 7 yuan and 1 jiao. At this time, Hengxing sold, and there was still much struggle. When Mackary bought American dollars for September at half a yuan, Yuanchang, Yonghui, Xiangfu, Xingyong entered at 7 yuan and a half, and Fuyu, Hengxing, Yuqing, and Yong still came to supply at a high price, and it fell again to 6 yuan and 9 jiao. Qianchang and Xiang took advantage of the low price to purchase, and the situation was still stable. After hovering, the closing price was 957 yuan and 2 jiao, and goods were sold at 7 yuan and 4 jiao. After the market closed, Hengchang and Yong sold and fell slightly. It was found that the highest price during the day was 958 yuan and 3 jiao, and the lowest price was 955 yuan and 7 jiao, with a fluctuation of 2 yuan and 6 jiao. As a result, it rose by 5 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was 34 yuan and a half because the HSBC Bank American Exchange list price did not change, and the standard gold price was slightly weaker at 1,003 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 46 yuan less, 5 yuan less than the previous closing. The registration price for this month was 958 yuan, and for May it was 957 yuan. The water replenishment in the morning was 958 yuan, and the same price in the afternoon. The price of red gold was 967 yuan. The situation in the bare gold market was still flat and sluggish. The formal transactions in the market, a total of more than 2,000 taels were sold by Tianjin He to Yingfeng Heng, etc., calculated at 12 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. Other transactions were quieter. The Central Bank opened for 210 pieces, which were sold by Yingfeng Heng, at a price of 957 yuan, which was still less than half a yuan different from the forward contract. As of today, there are still 196 pieces of the monthly contract remaining, with a total of three bullish and two bearish positions.</p>
<p>The transactions in the market were still active. In summary, Shunli, Wanxing, Hengyu, Chengkang, Yong, Tongfeng, Heng, Hengchang, Yong, Yingfeng, Heng, Yuanyi, Hengxing, Fuchang, Zhengchang, Yuqing, and Yong were on the selling side.

The Guang gang Shen Da entered more than 400, and exited more than 200. There were a few in the after-market. Hengxing entered a few and exited more than 300.

The forward silver price fell by 3 cents, the British exchange rose 125 against the US, the British exchange fell 3 pounds against the French, and the American exchange was flat against the British and French. London spot gold rose by 4.5 pence, and the private telegram silver price shrank by 3125, because bulls closed out, and the exchange rate was motionless and stagnant. The exchange rate market opened with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 1875, and American exchange at 34 yuan 875, which was slightly tighter for British and American exchanges than the previous closing. After opening, it was flat. HSBC Bank's list price was announced, and the British and American exchanges did not change. The Central Bank opened for cash and slightly tightened. Later, the Associated Press reported that people in the US government opposed all silver proposals and were now looking for ways to prevent them, and the market suddenly tightened. Banks strongly purchased American exchange, and the situation was extremely good. The noon was relatively quiet, and the after-market process was uncertain. The near-term American dollar was harder, and the far period was still flat. The banks' appetite was to purchase far-term and sell near-term, and there was not much change. Until the closing selling price, the British exchange was 1 shilling 4 pence 1875, and the American exchange was 34 yuan 8125 or 875, which was slightly tighter for British exchange and 125 tighter for American exchange compared to the previous closing.

<h3>Financial Market Lifeless</h3>
<p>In recent days, the financial atmosphere has been lifeless. Aside from the initial influx of telegraphic transfers to Shanghai from Kong Xiangxi at the start of the week, operational needs across various sectors have not been particularly demanding. This has resulted in a sudden stagnation of collections and disbursements. Even the foreign exchange market has remained unchanged, with the morning and afternoon rates steady at three fen. "Drawing a line and adding water" continued to be a pointless exercise.</p>
<p>Trading volume for interbank loans saw 4.5 million taels transferred in the morning market, with new transactions amounting to over 300,000 taels. Afternoon market transactions were a mere 100,000 taels. Transactions within the Small General Association totaled over 400,000 taels. Transactions involving redemption of pawned foreign goods amounted to over 500,000 taels, with new loans reaching over 900,000 taels. Banknote withdrawals and issuances totaled 1.6 million taels, with customer funds moving in and out remaining at 200,000 taels.</p>
<p>Bank receipts and disbursements: Foreign banks' receipts and disbursements of bills amounted to 1.78 million taels, with various commodity exchange pledges and miscellaneous receipts and disbursements reaching 3.78 million taels. Warehouse entries amounted to 500,000 taels. Chinese banks' receipts and disbursements of bills amounted to 2.56 million taels, with various commodity exchange tax pledges and miscellaneous receipts and disbursements reaching 4.67 million taels. Warehouse exits amounted to 400,000 taels. Japanese banks' receipts and disbursements of bills amounted to over 2.1 million taels, with various commodity exchange and miscellaneous receipts and disbursements reaching 3.78 million taels. Warehouse entries amounted to 200,000 taels. Money shops' foreign public bond receipts and disbursements amounted to over 39 million taels, with foreign head-cut receipts and disbursements reaching over 4.2 million taels. Remittances from various routes totaled over 300,000 taels, with cash disbursements amounting to 200,000 to 300,000 taels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total exchange volume at the local clearing house on the 12th was 5,929,840.59 silver dollars, comprising 2,970,393.14 silver dollars in cash and 2,959,447.45 silver dollars in remittance transfers.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Auxiliary Coin Suddenly Drops Four Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangsu small silver coins remained unchanged in both the morning and afternoon markets, valued at 834 yuan, a decrease of four yuan compared to the previous day, with very little trading. The morning market saw 6,000 jiao transacted, while the afternoon market saw 2,000 jiao transacted. Guangdong small silver coins were valued at 754 yuan in the morning market and 754.3 yuan in the afternoon market, resulting in a slight decrease of only one jiao compared to the previous morning. Trading volume in the morning market was 55,000 jiao, and in the afternoon market, 60,000 jiao. Copper coins remained unchanged at 323,500 cash, with 35,585 strings transacted, valued at 11,000 yuan in silver.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Volatility Extremely Strong</h3>
<p>丨Most Bonds Ended Lower, Few Higher丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw continued struggles, with prices fluctuating up and down. The chaotic political situation made people anxious. Major players were actively releasing or shorting positions, but buyers also showed strong demand, leading to intense competition. The future still hinges on the competition between bulls and bears. However, the large number of retail investors is crowding the market, which is sure to lead to greater volatility. Both sides are currently holding their ground, but a shakeup could cause significant changes, given the month-to-date trading volume of over 44 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market opened with a surge of selling by bulls, driving prices down. The decline intensified later in the day, with some losing seven or eight jiao. The heaviest selling involved issues 31, 35, and 52. In the second round, earlier issues experienced further declines. Twenty-year issues 11, 16, and 50 saw buying interest, gradually strengthening and recovering two or three jiao.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, more retail investors entered the market, pushing prices up another two or three jiao. Trading volume was lighter at the close, but buy orders still outnumbered sell orders, resulting in an average recovery of around three jiao. However, a couple of issues remained slightly down by about one jiao. The market showed signs of competitive downward pressure, with price results showing mostly declines and uneven performance.

<h3>Reduction in Yarn Production Rumors Cause Rebound in Marked Yarn Prices</h3>

In the afternoon, news of potential production cuts at factories further fueled buying interest, driving prices up by another 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.8 yuan across various months. Total daily trading volume was estimated at 56,400 bales. Sellers included Jifeng (1,350 bales), Yuanda (2,250 bales), Dafeng (1,250 bales), Huikang (1,400 bales), Dafu (1,000 bales), Taichang (950 bales), Jinchang (1,350 bales), Yuande (1,450 bales), and Dachang (1,150 bales).

<h3>On Heroes</h3>
<p>—Shou</p>
<p>The emergence of great scientists, thinkers, and artists is bound to have an appropriate environment. And the progress of a nation's civilization depends entirely on them. As the saying goes, the times create heroes, but heroes also create the times, which is probably true.</p>
<p>But what kind of people are our heroes? Are they people like Dickens, Edison, Da Vinci, Rousseau, or Clemenceau? At least, is this the kind of hero we idealize? Or are they Han Xin, Xiao He, Fan Kuai, or even Zhuge Liang, Lu Su, or even Zuo Zongtang and Li Hongzhang?</p>
<p>It is undeniable that even if one does not understand which dynasty Li Hongzhang belonged to or what he did, one still has to write his name on the sign. Even if one's talent cannot hold up even one of Li Hongzhang's feet, one still has to hang up his sign. It is no longer very "modern" to call oneself Zhuge Kongming, because there have been too many people throughout history who have called themselves that, especially fortune tellers, 丨丨 he is also a Crouching Dragon! 丨丨 then one feels that there is a Jianghu aura, and it is also comical. And many heroes and candidates for heroes, their idealized era is still Han, Three Kingdoms, or the Manchus!</p>
<p>Although, this is still the "best" case. It also requires reading a few history books or watching Romance of the Three Kingdoms to work. The ideal common people’s hero is to be able to live in high-rise buildings, have good farmland and wide residences, must have a magnificent family tree, and must have ten sons, a hundred grandsons, and a thousand great-grandchildren…</p>
<p>However, why do people still admire those who do not yet possess these conditions? That is because they are afraid that they will transform into heroes in the future, the so-called "candidate heroes." Thus, according to this traditional feudal thought, this nation cannot produce a different kind of hero, and in this so-called 20th-century world, the situation becomes dim and declines. Anyone who wants to be a great scientist or great artist is not tolerated by the world, and everyone tramples on them, squeezes them to death! Or tempts them to become degenerate and decadent!</p>
<p>Great thoughts can never arise from a degenerate nation! Try to think about what greater stimulation does an ordinary inland person have? Seeing a bronze statue of a scientist? Or hearing a piece of profound music? Or are they playing with the advertising of Eight Immortals mahjong牌 and listening to the hypnotic music of "Shake it, shake it..."?</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts While Traveling in Hangzhou (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>However, you don't need to fuss; Hangzhou people have their own logic to convince you. People who come to Hangzhou at this time of year come to spend money. Since they've come to Hangzhou, what does it matter if they spend a few more dimes or a few dollars? Besides, Hangzhou people depend on earning a few dollars during these few days, right?</p>
<p>Of course, there are many wealthy tourists who don't care about spending a few more dimes, a few more dollars, or even dozens or hundreds of dollars. But tourists like me do care because we can't afford to spend more money. This is probably the least welcome type of tourist for Hangzhou people. How can one expect to travel around West Lake cheaply?</p>
<p>However, even if you have money to tour West Lake, it's not necessarily very interesting. For example, if you hire a rowboat to tour the lake, the boatman will teach you a fixed formula: starting from the lakeside, first to "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon," then to "Wang Villa," then to "Baiyun Temple" and "Jing Temple" and so-and-so Villa, and... then where to eat lunch, and where to turn back. I've toured Hangzhou three times, and because each time the companions were different and none of them had been to Hangzhou before, when touring the lake, we always followed their ideas, hiring a rowboat for a full-day tour, and the three tours were exactly the same. I call this kind of touring an "eight-legged essay" style of touring, which is actually the most boring. The best way to tour West Lake is to use your two feet to run and climb. The farther you run and the higher you climb, the more fun you'll have. Other methods, such as taking a boat, sedan chair, or car, are not the way to enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>Although I once again took an "eight-legged essay" style tour of the lake this time, I also had a fun climb once, and during this climb, I proved that I am someone to be proud of.</p>
<p>What I climbed was the North Peak (named Gaofeng), but in my eyes, growing up in the mountains, I didn't think it was high, and climbing it was effortless. Because I believed in my own climbing ability and also believed in the ability of my companions, my companions were my wife and her sister, and also my nine-month-old child.</p>
<p>Of course, the child couldn't climb the mountain, and we had to carry her up. Regarding this, we didn't think it was a problem. There were three people who could carry her, and taking turns, wouldn't we be able to send her to the top of the peak? Under the mild weather, we advanced step by step from the entrance of Lingyin Temple, ascending. The child often switched from one pair of arms to another. Halfway there, although the three of us were sweating, we didn't feel tired at all, determined to climb to the Gaofeng.</p>
<p>Below Taoguang, there was nothing much, but above Taoguang, it became interesting. Many fashionable young ladies and gentlemen in Western suits, sitting in sedan chairs, all showed surprise when they saw us. Some said:</p>
<p>"Look at them, bringing a 'little one' up North Peak, how fearless of the effort!" Some said enviously: "They are so brave!"</p>
<p>One young lady even kindly warned us:</p>
<p>"This is a matter of life and death! If you fall on the mountain, what will happen to the child?"</p>
<p>To these "pearls of wisdom," we responded with a smile. Although we also felt a little "strained," we had great confidence in our legs and were determined not to "fall" and make it a "matter of life and death."</p>
<p>Climbing straight to the North Peak, looking down at the many young men and women below who were empty-handed and repeatedly resting while holding their "walking sticks," looking exhausted, we couldn't help but feel a little proud. But we didn't dare to be too proud because we saw those sedan chair carriers carrying others up the mountain, and they were indeed braver and stronger than us.</p>
<p>However, those gentlemen and ladies didn't pay attention to the bravery of the sedan chair carriers but only to us. Presumably, in their minds, the sedan chair carriers were supposed to have this strength, while we, on the surface, looked a bit like scholars, and yet we also had some strength, so it was strange.</p>
<p>From our perspective, those who sit in sedan chairs should also have the strength to climb mountains, but they have become accustomed to sitting in sedan chairs, and that strength has disappeared. The reason why we retain a little strength is precisely because we have never been accustomed to sitting in sedan chairs, and there is nothing strange about it.</p>
<p>Having traveled in Hangzhou, there is nothing much to record, only the above. To call it a travelogue would be too much of a buzzkill, so it is named "Random Thoughts While Traveling in Hangzhou."</p>
<h3>By the Wenlan Bridge (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ms. Mo Ming</p>
<p>"I've really never seen such a world!" One summer evening with no wind, Old Uncle Wu, as usual, leaned against the railing of the bridge, one hand holding a bamboo pipe, the other stroking his gray beard, and said with emotion. "When I was young, the wealthy people in this countryside all changed their fields to grow mulberry trees; but it still wasn't enough. Because silk factories are multiplying faster than mother cats giving birth, adding ten or eight more in a year!..." The old man coughed, then spat outside the railing, letting the flowing water carry his grievances somewhere. "My old bones have been worn out, and I've seen more harvests in these few years... than I've seen in the past thirty years, but the price is even cheaper than when I had a queue..."</p>
<p>"What we get is not what we want!" Da Niu, who was usually silent but whose words seemed to scratch people's bones, said. "For example, what we want is food, but what they give us is children. That's useless for both families."</p>
<p>His thin wife, sitting on the stone steps and holding her bulging belly, glared at him as if dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Once, he said some strange things that made people think he was possessed. He said:</p>
<p>"People shouldn't be strong in the first place, this can ruin people's souls! Look, the people in the countryside are worn down but won't die, starve but won't die; but is there even one complete person with three souls and seven spirits?" He was so angry and agitated when he spoke that his eyes were filled with red threads. "Really, either the souls of mankind will be completely destroyed in the future, or this thing called the countryside must disappear." His voice became even louder.</p>
<p>At that time, Old Uncle Wu, who considered himself a senior, stood up, spat, and walked away, shaking his head, saying, "Terrible fellow! But, who knows what will happen in the world!"</p>
<p>That autumn, I left my hometown. Later, I heard that it was in that year, during the "Pale Moon" period, that Uncle Yonglu fired Da Niu. His words would make his companions shake their heads helplessly even more, he was simply a dog barking madly in the pitch-black night, causing the other dogs to bark restlessly. By the summer of the following year, he was nowhere to be seen by the Wenlan Bridge, probably gone to a place that nurtured his soul.</p>

<h3>Western Journey Diary</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>1934 (Jiaxu), March 28th (Lunar February 14th), Wednesday, heavy rain, as cold as the end of winter.</p>
<p>At four in the morning, chaotic dreams were awakened by the sound of rain, unable to fall back asleep; got up to read a volume of "Huangshan Travel Notes" by Huang Qiuyi, a lieutenant from She County, a lead-printed edition in the Song style imitated by the former Shen Bao Museum, one of the "Odds and Ends Talks" collections. This travelogue, a total of twenty-five pages, records the events from August 28th, Xianfeng 9th (Jiwei), when he departed from Tan Du to Huangshan, to September 11th of the same year when he returned to Tan Du. Although the writing style is not very beautiful, the greatness of Huangshan, the difficulty of climbing, and the wonders of sunrise, cloud rise, pine trees, stone walls, caves, waterfalls, and hot springs are generally recorded in detail. If one were to go to Huangshan, it could also be used as a travel guide, so it was included in the luggage.</p>
<p>Yesterday I received a letter from Shanghai, informing me that there would be four or five friends going to Huangshan together this time. The board and lodging expenses are borne by the Construction Department, and those accompanying us along the way are dispatched by the Highway Bureau. Touring the mountain by order is difficult to avoid criticism that "the mountain spirit suddenly opened his mouth and said, 'Little Qingshan sees the master!'" However, the road is long and the mountain is deep. For commoners like us, unwanted and without property, it is not easy to make a grand tour. Moreover, my legs are not strong, my physical strength is not good, I lack the courage of Xu Xiake, and I have the recklessness of Ruan Bingtian. For people like Yutang and Guangdan, it is even more impossible without borrowing a little official power.</p>
<p>At four in the afternoon, in the heavy rain, a letter of invitation from the Construction Department suddenly arrived, along with a short note from Qiu Yuan, Zeng Jia, Yutang, etc., stating that they had arrived in Hangzhou and were staying at the West Lake Hotel. Braving the rain, I went to the West Lake Hotel and first saw a group of refined tourists who were departing at the same time and many acquaintances; Quan Ye and Pan Lin, however, were in high spirits and had already gone to Xiling Seal Society to appreciate the misty West Lake in its light makeup. After waiting for a while, talking with this one and that one about the weather and places we had traveled to before, around five o'clock, the four guardian deities returned to their residence. After a period of chaotic talk and several bursts of laughter for no reason, we decided to first go eat private cuisine and then accompany the official banquet. The place for private cuisine was the world-renowned Wang Fan'er, and the official banquet was in the hall of the Central Bank's villa on the Lakeside.</p>
<p>After finishing the private cuisine, we rushed to the Lakeside, to the hall of the Central Bank's villa, where the lamps and candles shone brightly, and five or six tables were filled with steaming dishes. Amidst the chaotic noise of everyone laughing and gorging, it was decided that more than forty people would depart in five routes: one route to Nanjing and Wuhu, one route to Tiantai and Yandang, one route to Shaoxing and Ningbo, one route along the Hangzhou-Jiangshan railway line, and one route to Huizhou, all the way to Huangshan. Yutang, Zengjia, Guangdan, Qiuyuan, the two gentlemen Xu Tianzhang from Shen Bao and Wu Baoji from Shi Shi Xin Bao, as well as this little one, were the ones going to Huangshan, accompanied by Mr. Jin Fupu, the chief inspector of the Highway Bureau.</p>
<p>Touring Linglong Mountain and Qian Wu's Tomb in Lin'an County</p>
<p>March 29th, Thursday, sunny. Last night's rain was mixed with snow, and on the way back drunk, I felt a little hesitant; I was secretly planning that if the rain and snow didn't stop tomorrow, I would definitely escape at the time of departure, becoming a Renegade in the travel team. Fortunately, I wasn't a newly recruited soldier, so there would be no charges. This morning, at five or six o'clock, peeking through a gap in the window curtain, the sky was surprisingly blue and clear, so I had no choice but to yawn and quickly get up to wash, change clothes, and pack my luggage. Arriving at the Lakeside, it was exactly eight o'clock. A group of people touring the mountain by order were already flustered, standing on the side of the road waiting for the car to come and take them away. When our car passed through Wulin Gate, passed Baoshi Pagoda, and headed west towards the foot of Qinting Mountain, the sun had just shone on the yellow wall of Laohe Mountain.</p>

<h3>A Woman</h3>
<p>— Wang Yue</p>
<p>When she stopped in this alleyway, relying on a stroke of accidental luck, the small shack, like an overturned dustpan, at the foot of the wall separating the residence from the wasteland, was considered her home.</p>
<p>It was made up of three six- or seven-foot-long bamboo poles, half a tattered straw mat, and a black linen cloth. The bamboo poles were slanted up like old-fashioned rafters, one end resting on a garbage bin built against the wall, and the other end resting on the ground, pressed down with stones. A broken mat was placed on top of the bamboo poles, serving as a roof, and the linen cloth, bearing the task of the wall, hung diagonally from the side to the bottom, like a curtain, more like a human nest than the streets and cemeteries.</p>
<p>But Shanghai is a place where every inch of land is worth its weight in gold, and there are laws everywhere. It's not possible to stay here for free. She has to serve every family in this alleyway: chopping firewood, scrubbing toilets, washing unclean utensils, and the soiled cloths of women and children. When the heads of the households are abused by life and want to strike back at life, she also has to serve as a target for people to vent their anger, enduring scolding and spit.</p>
<p>She can't speak and can only make a series of vague "uh uh" sounds because the area where her nose and upper lip meet has rotted away. But before, she certainly had a useful respiratory organ. She had used it to enjoy the fragrance of wildflowers in the fields, the fragrance of the earth in spring, and the fragrance of ripe grains in autumn. On her wedding night, she was also intoxicated by the male secretions she smelled for the first time.</p>
<p>The husband was a figure who habitually wore a tattered felt hat on the back of his head, an honest peasant. And like other honest farmers, he scattered his sweat on the soil, but carried fate on his head. But one autumn, when he returned from the landlord with a cross drawn on his account, he threw his tattered felt hat into the empty rice bucket:</p>
<p>"Damn it!"</p>
<p>So he decided to bring her, his woman, to this city of three million residents, preparing to shift the burden from the yoke of the land to the yoke of steel. He turned the broken pot upside down under the bed, packed his bags, and they put on straw shoes and walked. In a market town, they dug out the silver coins they had hidden from their belt and bought boat tickets. On the voyage, they were bewildered by the enormity of the steamship and the roar of the machinery, and were ashamed of their homemade shoes and homespun gowns. And their hearts were as flustered as their behavior... the destination that had previously been clearly visible, the one that could seize survival, was now vague and seemed frightening.</p>

<p>A Few Words</p>
<h3>On the Secrets of Success in Modern Times</h3>
<p>— Gu She</p>
<p>The first secret to success in modern times is "speculation." As long as you can speculate, there is no way to fail. Of course, speculation can also fail, leading to ruin and even death, but in today's society, there are still absolutely more people who succeed through speculation. Therefore, speculation is still the only secret to success in today's society.</p>
<p>The most important thing in the method of speculation is to be able to discern the weaknesses of today's society and attack them forcefully. Where are the weaknesses of today's society? First, it is in deception. Deception is the only backbone that constitutes today's society. As long as you can deceive, there is no way to fail. For example, if you go abroad to study something and come back, you can call yourself a doctor or master, and then steal some not-so-essential things from abroad, or short excerpts, and flaunt them before your countrymen, saying: "This is such-and-such, explained in a very mysterious and strange way." Fortunately, China's cultural level is originally low, and the general public has limited knowledge. Seeing you acting so pretentiously and strangely, they will believe it to be true, feeling that there are endless mysteries in it that only you can decipher. Thus, your status as a celebrity scholar is created invisibly. But in reality, isn't it just that? Looking through it, you actually have nothing in your hands. This is one example of using deception as a secret to success. There are many other similar things. From the political stage to general society, everything is the same. In short, as long as you can make it look good on the surface and say nice things, no matter how corrupt the content is, there will naturally be people who believe in you. This is one of the methods of speculation in today's society, commonly known as "selling barbarian heads." The second is "hypocrisy." This is also the only important weakness in today's society. The most practical manifestation of hypocrisy is the so-called flattery and bragging that are common in today's society. But the flattery and bragging mentioned here are not as superficial as the general public thinks, a stage of flattery that is obviously bad and inferior. It must be used in a more skillful way. Generally speaking, it is necessary to be able to turn around in all directions and be trusted in all directions. No matter what, don't offend people. Even if you offend people, you must offend them in a meaningful way; no matter what, don't make the people you should rely on feel that you are annoying. Even if they hate you, it must be unimportant people. In this way, your success will be achieved because society already needs you very much. You have become an indispensable figure among celebrities. The above are the two essential secrets to success in today's society. In a nutshell, it is to be able to discern the weaknesses of today's society and attack them forcefully. Deception and hypocrisy are the most important weaknesses in today's society. If you can work hard on this, the result will naturally be success. In addition, catering to fashion and choosing the most fashionable and relatively safe path is also an essential secret to success. This is the common meaning that should be included in the word "speculation," so there is no need to elaborate on it here. However, we must remember that these are the paths to success in a declining society! The real path to success is still "hard work"! Young people of the era, do you want to go down the path of decline? Then the aforementioned plan is an essential secret to success; otherwise, to achieve real success, there is only "hard work"! Whether it is in career, academics, personal matters, or social matters, only hard work can achieve real success! No matter how good you are at speculation and taking shortcuts, although you may be successful for a while, the result will inevitably ruin your bright life! Always remember! Our real secret to success lies here!</p>
<h3>Thoughts Inspired by the Tragedy of the Collapsing House</h3>
<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>The other day, during the strong wind, a tragic incident of a house collapsing occurred in Nanlin Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, killing a female servant and injuring five people. The first to fifth alleys of the lane were built the earliest, over thirty years ago, and were already dilapidated. Therefore, after a gust of wind, five buildings collapsed, causing this unfortunate disaster.</p>
<p>The solidity of house construction is of great importance to the safety of residents. Although there are magnificent and towering high-rise buildings everywhere in Shanghai, most of these are buildings of banks, companies, and large stores, as well as mansions and villas of wealthy people, so they can be built both firmly and solidly, extremely stable. Not only are狂风暴雨, fire, and earthquakes insufficient to damage them, but even if bombs were used to炸, they probably wouldn't collapse. As for many ordinary lanes, the appearance may look quite decent, but inside they are粗草. The reason is that these lanes are operated by a class of housing operators, who rent them to sub-landlords and third-party tenants, so when they plan to build, they make calculations, and under the principle of "paying the lowest capital and收 greatest profits," they start construction on a large scale. As a result, after the houses are completed, the foundation is not stable, and the walls are very thin. The materials used, such as bricks, tiles, and wooden boards, are all inferior goods. As a result, the houses feel very dilapidated not long after they are built. When遇到 great winds and rain or earthquakes, there is often the danger of collapse. When the fire god descends, the disaster is even more unavoidable. After the houses have been around for several years, tiles and bricks inevitably break, beams rot, and walls tilt. They should be inspected and repaired in time to avoid danger. But where do these property operators care about these things? They rent the houses to sub-landlords, and except for sending people to collect rent every month, they seem to have no responsibility at all. Sometimes tenants see that the house is damaged and ask them to repair it. They always shirk their responsibility, procrastinating for one reason or another, unless absolutely necessary. As a result, tragedies of collapsing houses are often heard. Not only do they put the safety of residents aside, but they also disregard the plight of tenants, often shouting to increase rent. The vigorous development of the rent reduction movement in Shanghai today is the result of this kind of exploitation. Although this movement has been responded to from all sides and has great momentum, the property operators deliberately remain calm and silent, so that the stalemate has not been resolved until now, and the turmoil arises from time to time. However, we dare to believe that the reasonable demands of these millions of residents will eventually achieve final victory.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the lack of attention to the construction and management of houses by Shanghai property operators has a significant impact on the safety of residents. For the sake of ensuring the safety of tenants, it is hoped that landlords will improve this matter in the future. When building houses, the foundation must be laid firmly, and the walls must be built sturdily. If there is a倾頽 situation, it must be repaired quickly. When years have passed, it should be renovated. On the one hand, the government authorities should also be very concerned about this. Not only should they closely supervise the construction situation, but they must also inspect houses everywhere from time to time. If there is any damage, they should order repairs for minor damage, and order reconstruction for serious damage. When the age of the house arrives, they must be urged to demolish it immediately to prevent accidents. As for the tenants themselves, they should not ignore their own safety. When renting a house, the most important thing is to pay attention to whether the house is strong. If there is danger, it is advisable to move or notify the landlord to repair it. If they don't listen, report to the authorities and take action. In this way, tragedies of collapsing houses injuring people may be reduced in the future, which will not be without benefit to the safety of residents.</p>
<h3>By the West Lake (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Danxin</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the spring holiday, I organized a group of five to visit the West Lake, famous throughout the world for its scenic beauty, for the third time. We spent two sunny days and two rainy days, rushing through the entire area. This kind of "riding a horse to view the flowers" tour, although taking in both "light makeup and heavy embellishments," makes it impossible to linger in one place, to caress ancient sites, to admire scenic spots, to commemorate old friends, to reflect on the past and contemplate the present; to have any kind of "feeling," "sigh," "recitation," or even to be quiet for a moment. It is simply not allowed due to the urging of time, and under the current circumstances, it seems almost unnecessary.</p>
<p>"Mountains and rivers, everywhere bright and beautiful," "Sunny and rainy, always wonderful and strange"—this is a couplet found in Zhongshan Park by the lake. It completely captures the scenic beauty of the lake and mountains that I saw, so there is no need for me to add any "descriptions" or "depictions" to narrate it in a rambling manner...</p>
<p>Walking into Jingci Temple, the main hall was gone, and it was undergoing extensive renovations, turning the old into new. The porter leading the way told the following interesting story...</p>
<p>"One day, a female pilgrim carrying incense and candles came to Jingci Temple to burn incense in the Jigong Hall; suddenly, a</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>small monk blocked her path, preventing her from entering. The abbot saw this and was very strange at the small monk, thinking that he should not offend a patron who had come to the door, and ordered the small monk to move aside. The woman then went in to burn incense. But as soon as she lit the incense, the flames shot up and burned down the Jigong Hall. At the same time, the small monk disappeared. A few months later, a Cantonese lady suddenly came, wanting to find a monk in the temple to go to her home in Guangdong to solicit donations to build a Jigong Hall. If there was such a monk, she would be very willing to donate money to build the Jigong Hall. The abbot knew that no monk had gone to Guangdong to solicit donations, but hoping for a one-in-a-million chance, he gathered all 300-plus monks in the temple and lined them up in front of the main hall, letting the lady recognize them one by one. It is said that none of them was the one. Just as they were feeling lost and bored, the clever abbot led her to see the Buddha statue of Jigong, asking if it resembled the monk's face. As soon as the Cantonese lady saw it, she couldn't help but put her palms together in worship, saying that it was exactly him; therefore, not only did she donate money to build the Jigong Hall, but she also volunteered to demolish the main hall and rebuild a new one; furthermore, she donated money to build a release pond in another location, totaling over 700,000 yuan. The monks all guessed that the small monk who blocked the incense-burning woman and the great master who went to Guangdong to solicit donations were both incarnations of the Living Buddha Jigong."</p>
<p>This is truly an interesting story. The Living Buddha Jigong was able to manifest, so it's no wonder that the Kalachakra Tantra Assembly had to be held at Lingyin Temple to create excitement. But I don't know whether the Panchen Lama or the Living Buddha Jigong has greater powers. Perhaps in addition to a Cantonese lady, there will be a Madame ×× who is willing to donate several million in money to buy several hundred airplanes, not only rebuilding the burnt-down Northeast but also paying for the return of Korea. That is unknown. And our Cantonese lady is truly spending money like dirt. I wonder if she would be willing to donate some aviation funds or support the Volunteer Army in the same way? Perhaps she, like those officials, believes that the power of Buddhism is boundless and is only willing to form karmic ties with the Buddha!</p>
<h3>The First Time Asking for Money</h3>
<p>— Jianyin</p>
<p>When a person is in swaddling clothes, he is unaware of everything; but he only knows to cry when he is hungry to ask for food, and cry when he is cold to ask for clothes. Besides this, he no longer needs anything. What a transcendent life this is!</p>
<p>But a person is born and must grow up. When he grows up, he inevitably develops all kinds of desires: wanting to eat good things, wanting to wear good clothes, wanting good toys, wanting this, and then wanting that. Because he does not have the ability to be financially independent, all his needs must be obtained from his parents.</p>
<p>Later, he gradually learns that everything in the world is exchanged for money. So he no longer asks for things but asks for copper coins. Because with money, he can freely exchange for good things to eat or play with. When he asks his parents for money for the first time, his fragile heart clearly feels a kind of inexplicable joy!</p>
<p>"Mom! Give me a copper coin to buy candy!"</p>
<p>The first time he asks his mom for money, he gets his mom's permission, and the joy in his heart is beyond words to describe.</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>In the organization of modern society, men have become the central hub, which is an obvious fact. In the family, the man holds the power to control everything with money. What about women? Sadly, for thousands of years, they have remained in a passive position, a dependent position. Even women with knowledge and financial independence, if they divorce a man one day, must demand alimony. Can't a man demand alimony from a woman? From this perspective, women are always in a dependent position.</p>
<p>A woman, in her maiden days, relies entirely on her parents for her food and expenses. But when she marries a husband, she relies on her husband. After marriage, when she reaches out to her husband for money for the first time, how uneasy does she feel?</p>
<p>"Hey! ... Give me half a dollar to buy groceries."</p>
<p>When the husband grants her request, the establishment of this economic system is clearly revealed. If in the heart of a proud woman, she should realize what kind of action this is!</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>A person wanders, unable to return to his hometown. His parents have passed away, his friends have left, he cannot find employment, and he cannot find food to eat. When his stomach is so hungry that he cannot bear it, can he really just sit and die? So, in order to prolong the continuation of his life, he has to find a way out. But he thinks left and right, exhausts his mind, and spends all his energy, yet he still cannot get a full meal. In a situation of desperation, he acts as a beggar and asks people for money. Asking for money is a shameful thing. No one wants to do it. But in order to live, what other way is there? When he reaches out to a passerby for money for the first time, how ashamed and sad he is...</p>
<p>"Sir... please... do a good deed, give... one..."</p>
<p>He has never begged anyone like this in his life. His voice is as faint as the buzzing of a fly. He simply cannot muster the courage to speak. Imagine the situation at this time: If the passerby grants his request, he will certainly be grateful to the point of tears. If the passerby does not grant his request, what sadness that would be!</p>

<h3>Staying in the City, or Returning to the Countryside?</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor...</p>
<p>I have a very serious problem now. Although it is something that I urgently need to solve, broadly speaking, it is also something that young people across the country need to solve.</p>
<p>I am a young man from the inland who has not yet graduated from middle school. Due to the bankruptcy of the countryside and the collapse of the inland economy, the middle class is gradually declining. Therefore, my family has also felt the impact of various storms, and the economy is becoming more difficult day by day. My education has been severely hampered, and I have had to stop and urgently look for a job. Although I myself feel that my knowledge is not yet sufficient, under this unreasonable education system, "the rich become wiser" and "the poor become more foolish." Suffering from this economic pressure, it is impossible to even think about entering the towering halls of learning again.</p>
<p>So, last winter one evening, a ship took me to Shanghai and I stayed with a relative. This is the ideal of my family, or perhaps it can be said to be the only guess of the masses in my hometown. They believe that there is definitely no way to survive in the countryside. The various businesses that are "candles in the wind," "flickering and about to go out," are unreliable and have no hope of expansion. Therefore, they only see going to the city as the ideal object. Here, there are prosperous shops, great factories, and magnificent banks and foreign firms. It is truly the "golden treasury" of people;</p>
<p>They are willing to drive all their children into this melting pot, believing that this is the only way out!</p>
<p>It has been five months since I arrived in Shanghai, and soon it will be half a year. However, I am still the same as I was at home—instead, I have become unemployed, a social burden. However, I have gained a considerable understanding of everything in the city and the various aspects of society in this short process. It makes me deeply feel that the city is just a prosperous shell. Hidden in its darkness are countless sharp knives waiting to slash people. The masses swarming into the city from the countryside are precisely making the city's industries squeeze out more dregs. The increase in unemployed people, coolies, and hooligans further exposes its contradictory, grotesque, and evil nature.</p>
<p>After several serious considerations and painful experiences, I resolutely decided to leave it, feeling that I had "no face" for the city. At the same time, an uncle of mine wrote to me, telling me to go to the countryside to help him run a rural elementary school. However, the compensation is very little, and I have to be buried in chalk dust all year round.</p>
<p>Ah! Mr. Editor! My dear Mr. Editor! In this environment, do you think I should stay in the city and wait for a better opportunity? Or should I return to the countryside without fear of hardship and work as a teacher? I am truly "hesitating at a crossroads," making me "unable to advance or retreat." I hope you can give me a very clear answer! Sincerely, Huang Yiran</p>
<p>Answer: This is a common problem. In the countryside, "there is definitely no way to survive," and in the city, unemployment is still common. So, the question raised by Mr. Huang—"Should I stay in the city and wait for a better opportunity? Or should I return to the countryside without fear of hardship and work as a teacher?"—in the editor's opinion, cannot be answered. But because it cannot be answered, it is not a problem. If the countryside is in a recession, the city will definitely decline. If Mr. Huang has no way out in the countryside and no way out in the city, then isn't going to either place the same? However, this situation where there is no "way out" everywhere cannot last long. In order to survive, people will definitely turn the situation of having no way out into one of having a way out. However, the problem is not in waiting for a better opportunity but in observing the reason for this lack of a way out and seeking a solution with the power of the group. Because the so-called unemployment, poverty, and other problems are inevitable phenomena produced by this society and the fact that there is "no work to do." Since Mr. Huang can find a job in the countryside now, it is naturally better to go back. Having been in the city for half a year and not finding a job, I am afraid that sitting here longer will not necessarily lead to a "better opportunity." "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." Mr. Huang, Mr. Huang, go back!</p>
<p>In short, relying on drilling, running around, etc., to solve the problem of employment is unreliable. We can only hope that society will not produce unemployment problems and that everyone will have something to do. Only then will we have a way out. But to achieve this goal, we must struggle. However, this struggle is not based on the individual but on the goal of striving "for society and for the individual at the same time." Editor</p>

<h3>Between Flesh and Blood (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Manzhi</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>After autumn began, oblique winds and fine rain swept across Lingnan. Although sometimes, a burst of bean-sized rain scattered people's boredom, it was only for a moment, and then it rained so weakly that it was annoying. Outside the city, the Lianjiang River, which connects to the sea, was surging with floodwaters. It was already dusk, when cooking smoke filled the city and the earth was about to turn black. The ferryman at the pier, wearing a straw raincoat, was preparing to lock the boat and go home. A person stood on the opposite bank in the rain, holding a paper umbrella, and it was impossible to see what kind of person he was. He was shouting to be ferried across. The ferryman pushed the boat away, muttering, "In this heavy rain, almost dark, wanting to be ferried across is asking for bad luck for yourself, and asking for bad luck for others, × mother!" The ferryboat approached the shore, and the person took the opportunity to jump onto the bow. The ferryman was worried that he would fall into the water and wanted to tell him that this would not be allowed next time, but he was too lazy to say it. The ferryboat crossed the river. Although struggling in the rapids, the ferryman put a lot of effort, he also had the leisure to take a good look at that person... The white cloth shirt and pants were soaked, and water was dripping from the hem. He was short in stature, had a thin face, and his gray-white and swollen complexion had eyes like a wild fox, and his hair was frighteningly long. He seemed a little familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere before? The ferryboat docked, the person put down two copper coins, and hurried into the city. The ferryman looked back at the other side of the shore to see if anyone else was calling for the ferry. No one was, he locked the ferryboat, picked up the bamboo pole, and went home. Just as he sat down at home and took a puff of his pipe, he suddenly remembered that it was Zheng Jia Yuting Sixth Master's son! He hadn't seen him for two or three years already. Where had he been? How did he become like this, so miserable?... The ferryman's simple mind couldn't figure it out, so he let it go.</p>
<p>At this time, Yuting Sixth Master Zheng was lying on a couch in his study, smoking opium. Outside the window, the rain was pattering on the leaves of the green banana trees; Sixth Master brought the opium pipe close to the lamp and smoked with a hissing sound, floating in a dream. The old servant of the Zheng family, Pu Ning—he was from Pu Ning County, and after arriving at the Zheng family, the masters and mistresses did not call him by his surname but simply called him Pu Ning for convenience—ran into the study with a pale face and panting breath. He saw Sixth Master smoking opium and stood beside him, not daring to speak. Sixth Master finished the opium in the pipe, the hissing sound stopped, and he exhaled a straight white smoke like a long arrow. He put down the pipe and was about to fall asleep. "Sixth Master!" Pu Ning called softly. Sixth Master hummed and ignored him, seeming to be having a sweet dream. Pu Ning said a little louder...</p>
<p>"Sixth Master, is young master back?"</p>
<p>"Who's back?" Sixth Master asked, his eyes still not open, seemingly dreaming very sweetly. " "</p>
<p>"Is it Jiangguang? Is he back?" Sixth Master said, opening his two bean-like eyes, which were frightening. At the same time, he suddenly sat up from the opium bed. He asked deeply... "Is that really that animal?"</p>

<h3>Katharine Hepburn (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Cang Sang</p>
<p>Katharine Hepburn has become a popular star since starring in the two films "A Bill of Divorcement" and "Little Women," and George Cukor, the director of these two films, is her confidant.</p>
<p>When "Little Women" was being filmed, she would arrive on set at nine o'clock every morning and would not leave until six thirty every night. For nine weeks, she really didn't know the taste of food. She ate a hurried meal every day and went to bed as soon as she could, so all her time at home was spent sleeping, resting her body. All her joys and sorrows were on the set, and George Cukor was the autocratic emperor there. After they completed two films together, they became the most intimate people. They exposed each other's inner feelings bare. In fact, a star and director will never succeed in a film if they do not understand each other's feelings. Whether it's hatred or envy, contempt or respect, they can hide it from the world, but they can never hide it from each other. After the screening of "Little Women," he said to people, "That's a great film!" She said it as if she had no part in it herself. She also said, "Its greatness is because George Cukor is great. I want him to direct other films for me. I will never let just anyone direct me. This must be arranged. A film will not exceed the director's talent."</p>
<p>It is news worthy of great fanfare in Hollywood that a red star is willing to say this, admitting that her success is due to her director. It is human nature to love success, but Katharine Hepburn's attributing her success to George Cukor can be a major headline on the extras.</p>
<p>When Katharine Hepburn is on set, the studio is closed to tourists, as if Greta Garbo is working there. But the reason is different. Garbo is shy when she sees the camera. Hepburn, however, acts as if no one is around when she is on camera. "She completely lets herself go in front of the camera. It doesn't matter who is watching." This is George Cukor's confession. However, the studio must be closed, but only because of the fear that people will misunderstand. Misunderstand their fights, shouts, and often barbaric behavior. Rumors of their frequent fighting have spread inside and outside. Someone even said, "I can swear that Hepburn kneels every night and prays that Cukor doesn't beat her to death!" She sometimes cried for three days in a row. Cukor was too serious. After three days, they laughed again, so the set was like a madhouse. If people were allowed to visit, wouldn't they misunderstand that they had gone crazy?</p>
<p>Hepburn's mother is old but is a stalwart of the women's rights movement in Connecticut. Theirs is a completely modern family. The words "can't" and "don't allow" are never heard in their home. Katharine Hepburn can do whatever she wants. Her father is a famous doctor and built a small stage in the backyard for her to play on. Such a family education has caused all the men and women in Hollywood and many other Americans to misunderstand her. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of ""The Cat and the Fiddle""</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Cat and the Fiddle</p>
<p>[Grand Theater]</p>
<p>When we often feel unspeakable pain in the cruel reality, we naturally hope to obtain a true microcosm in the film, so that people have a further understanding of society and life. "Golden Mountain," "The Road to Life," and "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," which is showing at the Shanghai Grand Theater, are able to grab all our emotions. The reason why they leave an indelible impression on our hearts is obviously the great unfolding of real life, which makes us unable to not be moved.</p>
<p>However, this kind of film accounts for only a very small part of the total number, because the real environment limits the growth of this kind of film. On the other hand, the people who create and control this bad environment know that it is not only necessary to suppress the new trend of cinema, but more importantly, to produce a large number of films that are far from reality in order to cover up the truth of society and alleviate the resentment of the masses.</p>
<p>There are really many kinds of films that belong to this category, so many that they cannot be counted, and "The Cat and the Fiddle" is also one of these works.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the whole article does not seriously unfold social problems, and what the playwright wants to write is only the love disputes between men and women, and the coincidence method is used to reluctantly connect some unfamiliar lives. Regarding this point, I think there is no need to explain it again, anyway, it is just a non-realistic love trick, a vulgar far-fetched association. Although it also follows the above-mentioned works of whitewashing peace.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this film is nothing more than an opera written for two big stars. In fact, McDonald and Novarro can still make money. However, their golden age has long passed. This method of selling fake heads seems to be unreliable in the midst of the current economic panic.</p>
<p>Perhaps, we will not forget McDonald's "The Love Parade," which once caused a sensation, but at that time, it was precisely because the opera on the screen began to rise, and people paid attention to this new film technology with surprised eyes. Now, the songless film has quietly passed its prosperous period and gradually formed a phenomenon of decline. "42nd Street" or "Springtime in Shanghai" have already reached the peak in the history of film technology. Up to now, films like "Hollywood Hotel" are probably no longer attracting attention, right? Similarly, "The Cat and the Fiddle" is technically inferior to "42nd Street." Can it still</p>
<p>make a strong struggle?</p>
<p>As for Novarro, in recent years, except for "The Barbarian," which still showed considerable skill, the glory of the silent film era could not be maintained after all. In this "The Cat and the Fiddle," only the lively and lovely posture can be seen in the first part.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we can prove that the director's grasp is insufficient. In the front, he used a light-hearted technique to create</p>
<p>a lively atmosphere, from Victor's acquaintance with the woman to the woman's selling songs to become rich. Afterwards, it changed to being stagnant and obscure. This is the weak point of his inability to be lively to the end. However, these are only technical issues, and the entire film has not given us anything, which is the biggest loss of this film.</p>
<h3>Review of "No More Women"</h3>
<p>— Yijun</p>
<p>No More Women [Cathay Theatre]</p>
<p>The subject matter described in "No More Women" is fresh.</p>
<p>This is where the lives of two divers are depicted, who salvage sunken ships in the depths of the Pacific Ocean and search for sunken treasures. The sight of that huge body carrying a diving suit, spitting bubbles, and walking on the seabed certainly made us feel novel, although the authenticity here is still questionable.</p>
<p>However, what is worth taking in "No More Women" is only the situation of the divers living on the seabed, and the rest can no longer give us anything. The usual love triangle and boring jokes only make us feel bored.</p>
<p>Two divers fell in love with a female shipowner, so they clashed for fame, wealth, and love. On a car in a market, they started fighting each other, and finally one diver was beaten into the water by the other. People thought that the diver was dead, but when the captain knew the news that a giant ship carrying two million in gold had sunk, he saw that the diver was not dead, so he reused the two divers and set off to salvage the sunken ship. At the bottom of the sea, the diver on another ship injured the diver on this ship, but fortunately another diver rescued him and returned fully loaded with gold. So the two reconciled and the love problem was never solved.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is just a shallow story. The pain of a ship's crew and even the divers is not exposed here, and the divers are advised to abandon their old grievances and serve a ship and fight with other ships.</p>
<p>The director is still worthy of praise. The struggle at the bottom of the sea, the car Elizabeth</p>
<p>mutual fighting on , and the atmosphere on the wharf can all capture the emotions of the audience.</p>

<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3>Impressions After "The Wind"</h3>
<p>— Xu Hairong</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, many scenes in this film must have been cut by the censors. Otherwise, why would we feel so many abrupt moments during the screening? Especially in the latter half, which is a great pity. For example, the synopsis mentions that Xiao Ming and his companions resisted the shipowner's failure to pay their due wages because they heard that the wages would be paid in the Southern Islands. If they wanted an advance, it would be calculated based on the silver price in the Southern Islands with deductions. However, in the entire film, we didn't see at all how they ultimately failed due to the suppression of violence.</p>
<p>However, although much has been cut from this film, its exposure of the狰狞 (zheng ning - ferocious) face of capitalists and its depiction of the inner workings of the lower social strata are still very thorough and worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>But I think the scene during the stormy night is the most intense in the entire film. The director shouldn't have made the scenes of the wild revelry at the night garden so lengthy, which reduced the power of the script. This clearly shows the director's lack of skill in rapid transitions.</p>
<p>The cinematography and set design are both successful. Especially the actors, each one makes us satisfied and has great potential. I hope all the actors can continue to work hard.</p>
<h3>Two Blockbuster Films Starring Jewish Stars Banned in Germany</h3>
<p>— Heqin</p>
<p>Since the National Socialist Party came to power in Germany, for some reason, they seem to have developed a deep-seated hatred for the Jewish people. Anything related to Jews is treated unfairly. Recently, an American film was banned by German authorities because the male lead was Jewish. This film, called "The Prizefighter and the Lady," starring Myrna Loy and Max Baer, had a wildly successful opening ten days before it was banned. This is because Max Baer is a very famous Jewish boxer who defeated the German boxer Max Schmeling for the world championship a few months ago. Therefore, the German audience all wanted to see this famous boxer, which is probably a major reason why the film was banned.</p>
<p>Before this film was banned, a British film called "Catherine the Great" was also banned in Germany. The reason was that the female lead in the film was Jewish, named Elisabeth Bergner. In this film, she played a graceful and dignified female Russian Emperor, which is said to have been very successful.</p>
<h3>Catherine the Great</h3>
<p>Truly, only extraordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, female rulers have never been ordinary women. Therefore, governing the entire Russian Empire was extremely difficult. Moreover, the indulgent and licentious life within the palace, and the environment of conspiracies and disasters, are by no means ordinary occurrences.</p>
<p>The great Catherine is not as great as we imagine. She is as delicate and charming as a small bird, yet unable to find love. However, her intelligence ultimately created many great achievements and sins, assuming sins are necessary.</p>
<p>The revival of an important figure in Imperial Russian history is of course thanks to the actors, directors, and producers. We must pay attention to the acting talent of the German actress Elisabeth Bergner and the male lead Little Fairbanks in this film. Nor can we bury the painstaking efforts of 克新納氏 (Ke Xin Na Shi) and 科逹氏 (Ke Da Shi).</p>
<h3>Re-expansion of "Romantic" and the Question</h3>
<p>— Hu Yue</p>
<p>(Respectfully answering Mr. Mu Tian)</p>
<p>Regarding the debate between Mr. Luo Fu and Mr. Mu Tian on the "Raging Flames" issue, it has already reached a considerable conclusion, and I didn't want to say much more. However, Mr. Mu Tian, being stirred by "beyond impressions and feelings" to "say a few more words," and interpreting my words with excessive meticulousness, leaves me with no choice but to make a small clarification.</p>
<p>Regarding the "symbolic" point, Mr. Mu Tian didn't specifically name me for discussion, so I'll wait until I can't stand it anymore before writing down my opinions. I won't discuss it here for the time being.</p>
<p>Because the author's worldview is a fundamental element in the method of creation, throughout literary history, the various and diverse "-isms" can be summarized into two streams—just as the development of worldviews can be summarized into two streams—the opposing mainstreams, namely idealism and materialism. (What idealism and materialism are is already the most basic of common knowledge. Mr. Mu Tian, please allow me not to add further explanations.)</p>
<p>In literary history, these two opposing mainstreams manifest in various forms. In modern times, there is the opposition between Romanticism and Realism.</p>
<p>From the late eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century, the establishment of Romanticism in Western European literature, regardless of the different forms it took in different countries and social strata due to varying objective material conditions, was always a negation of Classicism and a pioneer of Realism. It was a product of the transitional period, a stage in the development of bourgeois literature, and inevitably contained the remnants of the feudal aristocracy. This is what Mr. Mu Tian has told us, that there is a distinction between feudal romanticists and petty-bourgeois romanticists. Romanticism representing the consciousness of the landlord aristocracy is escapist and declining, while Romanticism representing the rising consciousness of the citizenry is upward-looking and "also has its reality." This is why in "Beyond Impressions and Feelings," I said that not "all" Romanticism is undesirable, or, in Mr. Mu Tian's words, not all are a negation of Realism and an avoidance of reality.</p>
<p>But the main reason why I said that not "all" Romanticism is undesirable has already deepened to "revolutionary realism" and "revolutionary romanticism." Mr. Mu Tian naturally already understands this. However, it seems that "upward-looking" Romanticism and revolutionary Romanticism are fundamentally different. The latter is originally socialist; therefore, it is not only not undesirable but also necessary!</p>
<p>A Gui in "Raging Flames" is depicted as an idealized (but not utopian, denying reality) character, but this is permissible.</p>
<p>Originally, these are all common knowledge. The New Culture Movement since 1928 has, after all, not been without achievements. This kind of common knowledge seems to no longer be exclusively possessed by poets and writers. Although pathetic, this kind of common knowledge that is bought and sold secondhand often faces dangerous situations. However, Mr. Mu Tian insists on "analyzing" Romanticism, but what he shows us is just a bit of common knowledge, which forces me to say something about common knowledge as well.</p>
<p>As for my saying that slogan-ism has already been cleared up, it is not to separate it from the practice of writers, but to say that the problem is already too old. Moreover, we really cannot bring out slogan-ism in "Raging Flames." On the issue of love and "wind, flowers, snow, and moon," we can only say that the stereotypical depiction of "revolution and love contradicting" is undesirable. Ultimately, is "frivolous love dominant" in "Raging Flames"? If so, with hysterical qualities, then we should greatly investigate.</p>
<p>Explaining an article sentence by sentence to others is truly a difficult task. But the issues that Mr. Shi pointed out in "Speaking Up for Injustice" that are worthy of re-expansion, as well as the valuable opinions that Mr. Mu Tian provided in "Protest," are all very important. I would very much like to see how these problems are resolved, or, in front of poets and writers, I will still presumptuously interject a few words.</p>
