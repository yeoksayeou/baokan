<h3 id="c10">國聯非常任理事我國落選恒 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>據十七日歐電。我國爭連任之國聯非常任理事一席。己爲土耳其所取代。长</p>
<p>當此東北猶在日本鐵蹄蹂躪之下。而素以和平正義爲標榜之國聯竟對我作如是之摒棄。無怪國人聞此消息。而皆表示失望也。然國聯之爲物。本非一單純的國家。而爲許多國家相集而成之國際組織。故其意志自不能不隨此等國家之意志爲轉移。歐西國家。深知其然。故每於不背國聯會章之範圍内。謀結久交上之集團。以取得票數上之勝利。我國自九一八以來。對於可以左右國聯意志之國家。絶少個别之聯絡。卽此次之競選非常任理事一席。諒亦缺乏事前充分之準備。其落選也固不能専以責人。再則我國上下。己往之信任國聯。亦失之太過。在九一八事變初起時。對於日人暴行。羣信國聯必能加以制裁。因之而因循坐誤者。實所不免。此又可見我國人對於國際關係認識之不足。弱國無外交之痛苦。吾人嘗之己遍。國人自尚夢夢耳。</p>
<p>然而以國聯方面言。實國聯有負我國家。而我則並無負於國。聯今日外電述歐洲某晚報社論。稱中國在過去遠東爭執中。雖屢與秘書廳發生爭議。終不得一伸其志。但中國始終未嘗步日本之後塵。而與日内瓦斷絶關係。對於國聯如此忠誠之國家。猶不爲國聯所諒解。而竟悍然拒絶其理由充足之請求。誠不可理解云云。此確爲切合事實之論。我國人固亦明知國聯之不能爲我助。半出於一般形勢使然。不過我人以爲我國盡力於國聯己多。又與遠東有重要關係。尚盼望國聯之終能伸其正義。一洗從前畏强凌弱之態。度而不謂竟棄之如遺。此所以不能不表示失望也。</p>
<p>今者我國人可以奮然自覺。矣世界無論任何國家。苟一旦遭遇外患。必全國之人。無分上下。捐除黨見。消弭意氣。以圖共赴國難。蓋國之不存。則黨派個人之尊榮。亦焉能自保。故我國今日。惟有舍棄一切成見。集合全國上下。團結一致。内部旣能自强。自無所求於他國。先折有言。國必自侮。而後入侮。我苟自强不息。則國際間一切不良之印象。卽可掃除。我不求人助而人自助之也。</p>
<p>故吾謂今日競爭理事之落選。非國人痛恨國聯之時。須知當日之過信國聯。與今日之痛恨國聯。同爲對國際關係認識之不足。而退出國聯之主張。尤爲過當。此區區理事一席。得之固不足喜。失之亦不足悲。若以顔面問題而遽欲退出則我國失顔面之事。亦夥矣。寗能一一計較耶。故爲我國計。（一）唯有痛攺本身之缺。憾力圖國力之充實。（二）謀建國際之信譽。以爲外交前途植良基。舍此而外。皆枝節也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）　此次國聯大會選舉非常任理事、中國未獲連任、倫敦輿論界以爲此事並非國際上有不贊可中國之意義、中國卽未當選、亦於威望無所損失、此外一般人以爲中國落選、乃日本作祟之故、亦非的解、要之中國所以落選、僅因行政院中理事一席、欲使亞洲各國輪流充任、至於遠東爭端之一造、得在行政院中佔有一席、雖爲各方所樂聞、但非常任理事任期連續不動、務求避免成一先例、此爲國聯會中一般之願望、此間若干方面以中國始終堅决擁護國聯會、茲見其竸選失敗、多表婉惜之意、如國聯會恊會其尤著者也、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　自中國失敗於國聯理事會之競選後、德國報紙頗有爲中國扼腕者、如某晚報今日載一社論稱、國聯大會之拒絕中國連任理事席之請求、實足證實國聯之爲帝國主義者及投機主義者所控制云、該報復指明中國在過去遠東爭執中、雖屢與秘書廳發生衡突、且屢不得一伸其志、但中國始終未嘗步日本之後塵而與日内瓦斷絕關係、此種對於國聯之忠誠、尤不爲國聯所諒解、而竟悍然拒絕其理由充足之請求、西班牙竟以大多數之贊成而獲連任、其誠不可理解之事云、（十七日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c111">國聯非常任理事我國落選顧維鈞王正廷之感想 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>本屆不幸落選明年仍可競爭</p>
<p>國民應注重内政然後有外交</p>
<p>中央社云、我國要求獲得國聯行政院非常任理事之連選權、己於十七日國聯大會否决、由圭耳其繼任非常任理事、我國此次競選失敗、此後國聯對遠東問題、將缺乏良好之貢獻、於國聯前途、關係至鉅、中央社記者、卽以我國落選事、往詢現在滬之我國駐法公使顧維鈞、及前外交部長王正廷諸氏、據談如次、</p>
<p>（我國明年再度競選）　據顧氏談、國聯行政院　常任理事爲五席、非常任理事爲九席、去年增加一席、計十席、共計十五席、當選者均屬歐美兩洲國家、第一屆國聯行政院非常任理事、竟無亞洲國家代表當選、是時本人奉派出席大會、故曾向大會建議兩項原則、（一）非常任理事、當注重地域分配、（二）未當選常任或非常任理事之國家、當輪流當選、頗得各國贊同、故於一九二○年大會中、卽根據是項原則、我國得到大多數會員國之投票、代表亞洲國家、當選爲非常任理事、此次任滿攺選、我國要求連任、未得大會三分二之大多數贊同、致遭否决、並由大會選舉土耳其繼任、但至明年、我國仍可再度參加競選、至於非常任理事、亞洲國家代表席數之要救增多、似非必要、蓋以前大會中、有提出要求增加非常任理事席數者、輒遭多數會員國代表之嚴厲攻擊、其原因則爲亞洲國家不多、無增加席數必要云、</p>
<p>（國聯缺少）　顧使對　我國此次要　求連任非常任理事、致遭大會否决、認爲極可惜之事、不僅爲我國可惜之事、卽在國聯本身上、亦一極可惜之事也、因我國係一酷愛和平、擁護國聯最力之國家、確有連任之必要、换言之、中國得連任、則於國聯本身、亦有利益也、顧氏又謂、我國係被武力侵略國家、而被武力侵略之事實、己經國聯證明屬實而己有决議案者、爲尊重國聯盟約計、我國連任要求被否認、殊屬一極大遺憾、際此遠東局勢緊張之際、於國際間之和平、尤應加以注意、目下我國旣不能聯任、則國聯對遠東問題、必然缺少相當之貢獻、爲國聯前途計、殊屬遺憾、</p>
<p>（土國競選存心己久）　至於　我國此次所以落選者、蓋以土　耳其加入國聯不久、土國在歐洲大戰後、努力振作、成一新與之國家、對於國際間活動甚力、如與各國互派大使等等、土耳其介於歐亞兩洲間、所以在歐稱歐洲國、在亞稱亞洲國、此次竟藉亞洲國家名義、得獲選非常任理事一席、土國之圖獲此席、己非一朝一夕、去歲、彼曾企圖應任國聯行政院主席及非常任理事等職、但均告失敗、此次捲土重來、雄心勃勃、土國外交政策、向與法俄及小恊約國取同一方向、波斯前亦曾參加非常任理事競選、而後竟聲明讓與土耳其、於此可知土耳其在國際上活動之力量、土耳其旣屬新加入國聯國家、又未獲選國聯任何職位、所以此次競選、得獲較優成績者、亦非偶然也、</p>
<p>（蘇聯入盟與我無關）　至於蘇　俄卽將加入國聯、而我國適於　是時競選失敗、顧使認爲並無直接關係、</p>
<p>（收復失地永誌不忘）　昨日爲　九一八紀念節、顧氏於接見記者時、並發表感想云、本人際此九一八紀念、感觸極多、東北淪陷、己三年於茲、而失地雖尚未收回　然人民與政府、對於收復東北失地之心、則固時刻不忘、所企盼於同胞者、際此外侮交迫之時、當舉國一致、一心一德、對於收復失地四字、永銘心頭、臥薪嘗膽、誓雪此恥、則失地之收復、决可指日而待云云、</p>
<p>（落選原因缺少聯絡）　又據　前外交部長王　正廷書面答記者問如次、（問）國聯常理落選、有何感想、（答）應力圖自强、（問）落選後是否將影響遠東政治現局、中國是否將列處不利地位、（答）未必、（問）國聯不予通過我國聯任、其背景意義、（答）大槪平時與各國缺少聯絡、（問）與此次蘇俄入盟問題、是否有密切關係、（答）有、（問）中國是否應謀對策或沉默、（答）當然沉默、不可以爲大事、强國若德若俄加入時、便可取得常任理事之資格、望國民注重内政、有内政方有外交、卽管仲所謂内政不修而外舉不濟也、</p>

<p>日使有吉向外務省請示</p>
<p>中央社云、邇來我國旅日僑胞、層遭日本當局無理驅逐、外交部除訓令駐日公使蔣作賓氏、向日本外務省提出口頭抗議外、並於十四日向日方提出正式抗議、此項抗議書、業經交由日本駐京總領事館轉交有吉公使、直至昨晚爲止、日使館方面、對於此項抗護書、仍表示尚未送逹上海、惟據外交界之確息、有吉公使業己收到此項抗議、刻正向外務省請示如何答復云、</p>

<p>（日警赴閩）福建當局、將滋事台灣浪人、交與日領署警察、一面向日方交涉、一方自行嚴防、而駐福州日領、己電致上海日領事署、請派武裝日警赴閩、日領署昨己調巡查長米澤、率領武裝日警巡查松下等九名、由滬乘日輪長沙丸、急赴福州矣、</p>
<p>（日艦開往）　駐滬日本海軍第三艦隊所屬二十六隊驅逐艦榆號·杭號·栗號·梅號·等、己由第三艦隊司令今村率領、乘旗艦出雲號、於昨午從上海開出、急往福州、表面仍以保衛日僑爲名云、</p>

<p>（借欵收繭）　我國絲業外銷銳减後、各絲廠均無法維持而停歇、今年絲價之暴跌、爲歷來所罕見、各絲商視收買繭子爲畏途、因此今年秋繭、顧問者寥寥、浙江省政府、己借欵自收自繅、江蘇省政府、鑒於金壇溧陽等處秋繭行將上市、而無人收買、爲救濟農村計、由建設廳長沈百先　與中國·交通·江蘇·農民·等四銀行、進行借欵、</p>
<p>（商定數目）　自經沈廳長與中國等四銀行鎭行初步接洽後、曾來滬再行恊商、其數目爲二十萬元、以收買之秋繭全部作爲担保品、俟秋繭售去後、卽絡續償還、關於利息及合同、尚在接洽、各銀行以是項借欵、係救濟農民、均表示同意、故决無其他問題、一俟合同商妥、卽可簽訂、</p>

<p>（毒案槪况）　本市禁毒、向甚認眞、自蔣委員長頒布嚴禁烈性毒品條例以來、雷厲風行、成效更著、該條例施行之第一個月卽六月份、卽經公安局逮捕戒犯四百三十五人、七八兩月逐漸减少、然平均每月破獲人犯、仍在七人以上、一律由公安局解送本部依法審辦、本部依據法令、凡吸食或服用者、一槪送往戒毒所限期勒戒、經戒毒所證明確己戒絶者、卽予交保開釋、日後再行傳案調騐、此等毒犯爲數最多、其次爲販毒犯、再次爲開燈供人吸食紅丸或爲人施打嗎啡針者、再次爲運輸犯、再次爲製造犯、此等人犯、情節重大者、則依嚴禁烈性毒品條例第十四條、照死刑减輕二分之一、攺和十二年以上之有期徒刑、以示矜全、最近一月來、毒犯雖仍源源解來、惟其中十分之九以上爲吸食犯、絶少販運製造者、此則大可告慰於社會者也、</p>

<p>（戒毒方法）　普通醫院戒毒、大多用鴉片之代用品、用（塡减法）逐漸减少、逐漸戒絶、然因血液中之毒分未袪、不久仍可發癮、此次本部戒毒經衛生局研究結果、攺用（自己血清）之法、其法以純粹之阿母尼亞與百分之十之樟腦油等配合後、貼於毒犯之胸部、約經半小時、卽在該部起數小泡、當用温　法、再經相當時間、待數小泡聯合後、卽將泡内之毒汁用消毒之注射器吸出、注射於該犯之皮下、如是受戒者經一次之發泡注射、卽可覺身心清快、若毒癮深而於次日仍有發癮現象者、亦可依上法作第二次或第三次之發泡注射、至第三次後、無有不戒絶者、總之、此次蔣委員長頒布之條例、對於販運製毒者、槪處以極刑、而於吸食及服用者、其第一次一槪交醫勒戒、交保開釋、不科徒刑、亦不科罰金、如此寬猛相濟、足使犯民對於政府畏威懷德、故施行以來、成效大著、現在戒毒醫院之免費者、僅有本部對面之市立戒毒所、然因困於經費、不能多收自動投戒之人、目前登記者、己逾二百多號、而後來者尚絡繹不絶、甚望慈善家繼起創辦、使貧苦市民、皆得脫離黑籍、至本市特區法院、對於烈性毒品案犯、仍依禁烟法辦理、紅丸嗎啡人犯、或將視租界爲安樂窩、將來租界禁毒事業、能否有成效、内地禁毒事務能否不受租界之影響、此誠吾人及租界當局所當密切注意者也</p>

<p>丨丨答袁慶炎君</p>
<p>前日因爲（讀書消息）停刋了本文一天。以上兩天將袁君所來信摘出大要，並就靑年人對于此事一般的通病，一般的說過了。今日専就職業的態度，以解釋袁君煩悶之由。（編者）</p>
<p>袁君對於職業的態度的錯誤的根由，不過是屬於上面己說過了的，靑年對於生活的態度一方面的問題。在原則上，上面一番話可說己答覆過了。不過，我刦還想對它更詳細的說一說。袁君以前打算在米行中求出自己的出路，這就袁君的實生活而言不能說不對，不過，袁君不能把米行看作是個孤立的東西，它與社會其他一切完全没有聯繫。如果只是閉着眼睛，不看社會以爲在米行中可以找到自己的一切希望，那是大錯特錯了。須知米行不過是整個社會中最小的一部分，等於一個鐘表上一顆小螺絲針似的，（這比喻當然還不甚確當，因爲米行對於社會還並没有螺絲針對於　那樣、的關係）它是負有流通的一點供用，在今日的社會結構是需要的。但它的生存發展，單獨的去估計，是不可能的。它要受千千萬萬的其他社會關係的影響。如果你是閉着眼睛將來行有成孤立的而要在其中求出路，結果，遲早是全要使你失望。你看到這裏，也許要反問我，世間　那一種職業是固定的，千分之千可以不受社會的影響呢？我答道！朋友，世間上就没有那種職業，在今日這個社會裏，一處發生了變動，就要影蠁全體，誰能肯定自己的希望能算數。這裏，我己告訴你了，你不要對你的職棄埋怨厭煩，其他任何高尚的職業也没有兩樣。也許你要更進一步反問我了，照這樣，旣然我們個人依靠的一切都是冰山，人生還有什麽希望，什麽出路可言？那不如得過且好了。朋友，　你如果提出這種反問，那我又要提出這是錯誤的。這是你的看法的錯誤。你不該只把眼睛看在個人眼前的一點利害上，我己說過了，你要求出路，單獨從一個人出發是不可能的。你暫時有飯吃，或者還有點多餘，但是假如你有周圍都没有飯吃，你就不能獨單平安的吃。人總是要求生存的啊！没有路走了，誰不要求出路呢？但道出路，不要在一個衖堂内轉圈子，你同時還要找出這條衖堂是通那一條馬路，這一條馬路與其他的馬路又是如何的銜接的。至於因爲在衖堂内找不到出路時，或找失敗了，就等着餓死，那只是最少數没有生活的人纔會如此，生活的出路終是有的呀！你要把個人的問題放在大衆中去解决。在大衆都不能生存的時代中，自然個人也是不能生存的。那我們就應把對個人的和害不要作過高的打算，反要注意到我自己生存的前提的大家的利害上。譬如目前中國民族嚴車危機的時候，我們應將目光射到這個大家生死存亡的事情上面去，至於個人的生活呢？自然也不能不顧及，不過，不應不管社會，個人要求太好的生活，太幻想的生活。在這時代大家都應學習艱苦，脚踏實地的過活，不應再睡在鼓裏空想。至於對職業呢？我們以爲祇要對個人的生活，奮鬥的目的有了一點　解。什麽職業都可以，都無什麽高貴與卑下。我們對職菜的態度是維持最低限制度的生有就算了。對職業祇要不作過高的希望，同時也不會有受不住的失望的。我們的社會關係將我送入米行，作一個跑街下河的夥計同然是很可以，即令我的社會關係還没有這般（高貴），只能讓我去作苦力，充茶役，拉包車，賣小報，澡堂中去替人擦背等等，又有什麽不可做。都是在求生存。人到了某種田地，到某個山裏唱某個歌，只要你尚想做人，有一定的目標，職業雖有高下，又何足侮我。何必去厭惡它。自然，你在無聊時，妄想做國府主席，那却是不必的。因爲那是有害的幻想，不獨不能實現，並且與整個的社會目的也是相違不下一萬八千里的。</p>

<p>關於第五點（自編敎科書灌輸反英之思想）、話是一貫、事是兩段、金氏把這件事作爲解散馬來亞中國國民黨理由之一、那末所指（自編）當然指國民黨（自編）而言、試問國民黨（自編）何項敎科書、書名爲何、反英思想、見於第幾本、第幾頁、書本是實證、不是可以虚誣的、據我們所知（其實英政府亦能知）不僅是馬來亞中國國民黨未有（自編敎科書）、甚至中國國民政府敎育部尚未（自編）敎科書、其有（自編）、不過係中華書局、商務書館等書賈（自編）、决不自馬來亞中國國民黨（自編）、金氏欲解散國民黨、儘有他總督的權力、不應如此虚張事實而恫嚇英政府、此種商人（自編）敎科書、大都營業性質、陳列書店、聽人選購，、讀者有取捨的自由、何况金氏身爲馬來亞長官早己施行了取締的權力、又何須拿來俆解散馬來亞中國國民黨的口實、我們認爲金氏未免失言、回想去年星加坡的中華書局、因爲適應環境的需求、特請羅良鑄博士編輯各種小學敎科書、經當地提學使核准通令各地華校採用、如果這樣愼重還免不了嫌疑、不但是厚誣華僑、連當地的提學使也牽連在内、試問金氏容不他屬下有個反英思想的提學使、（未完）</p>

<p>— 黄克威</p>
<p>九月了，九月在故鄕是捕魚的時節。</p>
<p>在漲滿了秋潮的江上，那些剛從船塢裏拖也來的油漆新的漁船，便像黄葉子一樣漂浮着了：當月圓的十五夜，捕魚人都買了大魚大肉，虔誠地去祭江神，這樣可以保佑水程上太平。這一夜，他們盡情吃了一餐合家團圞酒，然後興奮地回到船上，掛起一頂小巧的白帆，他們離開了妻子和兒女，冒着危險去和狂風怒浪搏鬥，换一口飯吃！</p>
<p>女人們站在江岸邊望着一點點白鷗似的漁船順流漂去，一種惶恐和希望的情緒壓上心頭，伊們喃喃的祝福着前途風平浪静，伊們濃厚的期待着捕得大批魚兒平安回來。</p>
<p>如果老天無情的刮起了暴風大雨，於是伊們會歇斯底里地呼喊起來，不顧寒冷，不顧雨淋，像狂瘋一樣奔到江邊，望着那浩蕩洶湧的大江哭呌，或跪在雨點下向蒼天禱告，伊們是多麽可憐呵！</p>
<p>年來船租重，捐稅多，魚價賤，而外輪的侵襲又多了捕魚難之苦！漁人們永遠和飢餓死亡挣扎着，但咀嚼魚兒的人們，誰會知道這鮮美的滋味裏是滲着漁人們多少的血汗呢？</p>

<p>（九一八）紀念恥日的禮堂，大人先生們照例演說一番，詞句極爲沈痛。有人說他演說過後，也許代太太要買斗香和月餅，點綴中秋節呢。</p>
<p>民衆們都不約而同的拍掌，在這掌聲中，一閧而散，忙着買斗香和月餅，老早把（九一八）輕輕抛到九霄雲外去了。</p>

<p>— 張病鴛</p>
<p>廣東香山縣，别名（鐵城），爲全省縣治中之著名鉅邑，在清代素有（臥十萬）之目。蓋謂守斯邑者，不須辛勤羅掘，卽安然高臥，歲亦可獲致十萬金，誠　仕也。民十七年，革命政府定鼎金陵，以該邑係孫總理珂鄕，特議更名（中山縣），并規劃爲全國之模範縣，所以示尊崇而資紀念耳！縣西城外，有埠曰（石歧），開闢己數十年，華洋雜處，帆牆林立，輻輳含接，商賈往返省港澳間之航，八小時卽可直達，交通至便利，抑亦該邑繁榮之最大原因。由西城廂至埠，有通衢，是曰（西門大街），市廛櫛比，精華薈萃。惟此城門雖設常關，行人出入，必繞道南北二門，習慣相沿，初不爲異；亦不以奔馳爲苦。舊例值除夕之夜，及元旦之晨，始一開放。意以歲尾年頭，爲周而復始更替之日，在此時期作一度開放，殆卽可代表一歲之中，并未關閉矣。世俗所趨，可哂孰甚！</p>
<p>當其啟鑰之際，由邑宰佈告週知，頗鄭重將事，且限制極嚴，守門典史，設偶誤啟閉時刻，立登白簡，可見封建制度之權威，要亦迷信使然。蓋在城西對河岸上，有危塔聳立商崗，始築於唐代，番人來華貿易，咸由香邑登陸，此則察視航行啟錠之風信塔也。計共十七級，遙遙確對西門，每日未刻，太陽徴偏，塔影被日光映射，遂倒臥於城門圈裏：惟此奇跡發現，須在陰濛天氣，陽光慘淡中，始徴隠而若現。若烈日當空，片雲不存，反無所見。其建設之奇，眞有巧奪天工之妙！衡以科學原理，必有莫大之發明，所惜無人研究，竟因民間偶爾有蕩檢踰閑之事跡，遂歸罪於塔影倒射，城圈所致。歷代相沿，堅持其說，於是官民合力，緊閉西城，以拒塔影。數百年來從無非議者，而父老尤能津津樂道其事。愚九齡而去鄕，與浮屠作别時，猶見西門緊閉，一若深慮其影之侵臨。今者縣稱模範，百政皆興，是城己不存，塔狀如何？殆不可知。或者滄桑而後，塔果有靈，豈亦將隨革命而先革心，現己促進社會靡風於敦厚歟？</p>

<p>除掉他的氣憤塡胸的表情而外，光緒並不曾說什麽話手足也不曾動過，他對於這個出賣他的自由奸臣，顯然是十二分的鄙夷：他的過度的冷落的神氣，很明的地告訴人家，雖然他的唯一的伊人丨丨袁世凱，己在他面前跪着，但他只當是没有看見一樣。</p>
<p>袁世凱也未嘗不見光緒臉上的表情，但他己明知這個可憐的脚色，决不能再有什麽舉動，因此絶對不加注意，態度依然極從容。他請過聖安之後，便和太后隨便說了幾句話：同時，用來作爲接駕大典中的一幕的樂隊，也開始演奏了。袁世凱所備的樂隊却不是中國的古樂，乃是一隊很純粹的西樂隊。大槪有二十個人，所用的樂器和外國行伍中的銅樂隊一樣。據說：那一個樂隊長乃是由袁世凱化了錢，資送他上德國去専習音樂和作曲的留學生。他的技術，的確很不錯；尤其在那個時候，眞可說是中國數一數二的西洋音樂家了。他回國之後，便把他所有的時間，全用在敎授袁世凱自己所揀選出來的一班少年軍官們怎樣演奏西樂，想來也己經過了不少的時候，所以我聽他們奏得己很不差了！</p>
<p>袁世凱因爲自己是軍人出身的緣故，所以特地故意的把這一次接駕的種種儀式，使之盡量的軍隊化：除却這一隊由二十個少年軍官所合組成的樂隊之外，他還調來了大隊的軍馬，一律頂盔貫甲，端端整整地排列在距離月台約百碼左右的所在，向太后遙拜。我眞不知道袁世凱要他們來做什麽？（一三一）</p>

<p>這熟識的從炒白菓者嘴裏發出來的歌聲，又從街頭乘着輕風送進我的耳管，唉！又是這個時光了。）我不禁沉痛地這樣哼了一聲。同時一幕回憶像電影一般在我的腦際閃映起來：就是去年的這時光，每逢這徴妙的歌聲在空中蕩漾時，八歳的小弟弟便會吵着：（買，媽，買，）媽媽就放下了針綫的七作。吩咐了娘姨。於是一刹那就見在娘姨的臂灣肘裏着一隻小籃子，滿盛着白菓從外面跑進來，那時小弟弟的兩眼便笑的成了一條縫，嘴張的像斗般大，一面跳着，一面衝前去，兩隻小手就在籃子裏亂抓起來。</p>
<p>時光在不知不覺中爬着過去。而今，夏又悄悄地走了，那秋又重復來到人間。那輕妙的歌聲又在徴風裏吹拂着。然而，天哪！現在，我的媽媽呢？的的小弟弟呢？人事的變幻眞是那樣的莫測哪！是去年的冬天，我的媽媽和小弟弟竟同時得了不治之症，先後抛了爸爸和我到另一個世界去了。而今這歌聲雖然仍舊像往年一樣的蕩漾着，然而聽見誰再吵着唤媽？更在何處去再找媽呢？</p>
<p>一陳濃一陣的悲哀在我肚子裏噬嚙着。這時那歌聲却隠隠地又在起了：（白菓妙來糯又糯，······）我不禁馬上用兩手蒙住了耳管，我再也不忍聽下去了。</p>

<p>— 張枕錄</p>
<p>商務印書館急切地跟上去，製出和仿宋體相仿字體的鉛字，槪略的分别，在筆劃起　處的　　不同，和横劃斜勢傾側度數的减少。他們稱爲（仿古活字）。</p>
<p>商務印書館另製有一種眞書（就是止楷）體的鉛字，排印出來，粗看，好似手寫的楷書一般，雖然總嫌呆滯一點。</p>
<p>不過這一體鉛字的大小號數製得太少了，（通常應用須備六種丨丨自大號至六號）不够應用，並用缺字很多，稍爲生一點的字便没有鑄備。每排一篇百個字的文字，常常要特爲照這一體刻起幾個字來凑進去，而刻字究不能與鑄字調和同化；幾個刻字破壞了全局的美觀，實是恨事！有一家洋商呌商業印字房，也鑄有眞書體的鉛字，犯子與上項類似的弊病：但是我看到了全中國無數智識皆級的人，無數提倡實業救國的人，全上海幾千家全國不下萬家經營印刷事業的商店和廠家，難得有人高興做這項革新中國鉛字體的工作，而那少數僑商中竟有人猛着先鞭，代替我們做了，我恐伯便是金石印章之學，我國也要没有人研究，而讓外國人去靡桬撫奏，這個日子就在目前咧！</p>
<p>說到金石，在六七年前，有一位精金石，能文章，而又擅書六朝字的易大厂君，曾設華南書社在望平街，預備出品一種魏碑體的鉛字，爲文化前途作偉大的貢獻。他不恤積年累月，苦心孤詣的，按照鉛字架盤順次所列的字數，冩居魏碑體字，大號至五號有五副。（就是有五種大小不同的字）他委託一家鑄字所代做雕銅模和澆鉛字的工作，被經過了很久的時間，纔有少許魏碑體鉛字鑄出。我曾見過那一體活字印的名刺等小件，實在娟秀宜人，超邁其他出品的各體，丨丨這大部份是那書法又好又齊之故，奈何那代辦雕模澆字的工家，工作太過遲緩，遙遙没有完成之期。那華南書社不及久待，後來也停辦了。這椿大有關於我國工業前途和美術榮光的事業，就這樣地輕輕消滅了。知道這事的人或者不多，至今談起了都還代爲可惜咧！</p>
<p>中文鉛字字體的革命運動，有如上述，像易君所創的魏碑體，更好比流血殉難的烈士一般模樣，這些，多少唤起了社會的注意的同情。於是現在有鑄出眞書體的鉛字發售，製造得較前述者也完備了。尤其是這一二年來，另有不少鑄仿宋體字發售的店家開設；仿宋體所印的字隨之愈加盛行，差不多要纂取佔奪那老宋體的地位了。試看，最近時的鉛印出品，那班商業和人事應用的，單張零件的印件，姑置不提，就是那班所謂文化前鋒的訂本書籍，定期雜誌，小報等類，也無不隨着他們環境的便利，儘量採用老宋體以外其他字體的鉛字排刋，以求適合讀者的心目，而增加他們刋物本知在美術上的價值。總之，這鉛字體攺化和繁化的　　不過，鉛字字體的增多是一件事，字體的好不好，勝不勝，又是一件事，新出字體的工藝製作成功不成功，列是一件事，這都該由印刷工藝之家與社會羣衆加以鑒别而處置。如有字體不好，實在要不得的，應該與衆共棄他，如有字體是好的，而被製作得太壞了，應該指導而督促攺革他，這中文鉛字體纔得進化而達到美術的境界。不信，試看在仿宋體不曾有鑄售的時候，那一班劣手摹刻的仿宋體鉛字，要是給聚起排，印，成件，你對於這一項所謂仿宋體的印件，不知你將得到何種程度的感覺。我呐，即使看到了現在鑄售的所謂仿宋鉛字所印之件，對於或有是出於字模（推而至於書冩）根本欠佳的，己深歎那種粗製濫造的工藝，是足貽國家以恥辱了！</p>

<p>劉寳希創西靑新紀錄</p>
<p>百碼仰泳一分十四秒四</p>
<p>上海廣東游永隊、得香港埠際隊華人四健將之臨時客串參加、昨晚與西靑年會、舉行游泳對抗賽、觀者尚盛、對抗結果、廣東不幸以二十五與三十五分之差、爲西靑所敗、惟競爭形勢、則極爲緊張之至、郭鎭恒劉寳希兩健將、仍保持蛙游與仰泳冠軍、劉寳希且以一分十四秒五分二之成績、打破西靑四年來之百碼仰泳紀錄不勝難能可貴、爲國人爭光也、</p>
<p>仰泳新紀錄　仰泳出席選手、爲劉寳希與間而明、西靑爲開能及麥列斯脫、劉一路佔先、冠軍毫無問題、到達終點、超出第二名十五碼、成續爲一分十四秒五分二、打破西靑一九三一年創立之一分十四秒五分四之最高紀錄、西靑紀錄爲華人保持者、去秋有郭鎭恒創立之二分四十五秒五分三之二百碼蛙游紀錄、今劉君斷郭君之後、爲第二人、昨晚簡而明一路落劉君後不多、列第二、但最後二十五碼、以氣力不濟爲麥列斯脫所追出、差一手簡列第三、</p>
<p>蛙游與接力　二百碼蛙游、郭鎭恒之第一、毫無疑問、但事有出人意外者、簡而潔在最初之八十碼、竟　郭君之前、二西人落後頗遠、八十碼郭鎭恒遂一躍居先、到終點、獲勝有一池之遙、約二十餘碼郭成緉爲二分四十五秒五分三、惜不及去年所創之二分四十三秒五分二之紀錄花式接力、憑郭劉徐三大將之努力、得勝尚易、而二百碼自由式接力、則在劇烈競爭之下、以一寸之差、失敗、不勝可惜、</p>
<p>失敗之原因　廣東隊之失敗、在於二短程及跳水之不振、五十碼及跳水一二兩名、俱爲西靑包辦、百碼及四百碼僅得第二名、故雖蛙游及仰泳獲勝　終於無濟也、對抗成績如下、</p>

<p>國立交通大學校長黎照寰氏、近以遵奉政府明令、提高程度、充實内容、故於課務之攺進、機械儀器之設備、圖書之添置、以及各種實騐室播充、雖以常年經費被减四萬餘元之多、猶力圖振作、記者昨訪晤該校當局、兹將所得該校最近校務情况、分誌如次、</p>
<p>（一）畢業學生　該校上海本部及北平唐山兩學院上屆畢業學生共二百三十餘名、除己考取江蘇·安徽·河南·東北·清華·中英庚欵委員會等官費出洋留學生十餘人外、自費出洋者亦約有二十餘名、（該校歷屆留學學生以此次爲最多、）至其他一部分畢業生、除己由各省市建設機關·銀行·工廠·公司等處事先約定己得職務者外、其餘多數則分赴國内各鐵路實習　近年唐山工程學院　添設之建築、水利工程兩門及上海本部土地木工程學院添設之道路工程一門初次畢業各生　試用成績均佳云、</p>
<p>（二）本屆新生　本年度一二兩次招考新生、各地投考者共有二千餘人、該校因奉政府明令提高程度、故將選錄標準重新規定、又該校每次錄取新生均有定額、此次招考新生雖有及格者、亦以限於定額、未盡取錄、計上海本部各學院僅取百八十名、唐山土木　採冶兩科約七十名北平鐵道管理科約三十五名、平均每七名中取錄一名、各科成積均較上年尤佳、足見各地中學辦理亦有進步、現在新生均己繳費入學、日昨該校在體育館舉行歡迎新生茶話會、校長敎務長各院院長及訓育長事務長均有懇切訓話、</p>
<p>（三）各項設備　本年度該校上海本部各學院均有相當發展、如管理學院於財務·鐵道·公務·實業各門添開四年級班、並增設車務實騐室、搜集國内外之各種車務材料及統計等、以供學生實習之用、又科學學院添加冶金學一科、並新設特種化學試騐室　光學電磁試騐室　工業分析試騐室、及工業化學試騐室、皆己裝置齊全、唐山冶金試騐室正在趕建、約秋後完成、至各工程學院計擬添設各科如汽車工程、航空工程、冷藏工程、紡織工程、電照工程及電力通運等、如經費有着、當可次第開辦云、</p>
<p>（四）新聘敎員　本年度各學院敎員、大都仍舊、物理講師買存鑑君請假赴平綏鐵路擔任機務、化學敎授沈鎭南博士、因應廣西省政府特聘、請假一年、南赴籌設糖廠、運輸學敎授周鳳圖博士、因應招商局特約　亦請假一年、辦理聯運事業、管理學院與科學學院因增加各種科目、新聘敎授有前紐約大學講師林疉博士、前燕京大學敎授李炳華博士、前財政部司長俞希稷會計師、前麥倫學院校長夏来麟博士、前北平女子文理學院院長顧澄君、前曁大數學系主任湯彦頥碩士、前安徽大學敎務長丁嗣賢博士等及其他講師、唐山學院因增設採冶系四年級班、新聘敎員亦有數人、如哥倫比亞大學採冶學院博士王鈞豪、現正北上海任云、</p>
<p>（五）重建書庫　該校圖書館庋藏中外書籍頗多、現有館室、不敷應用、且因書籍重壓、樑柱略現偏斜、爲安全計、書庫添建實不容緩、然以需費頗巨、校欵有限、無法應付、己由前校長唐文治先生等發起分别向各地校友及熱心敎育人士募捐、以期補救、記者並訪晤該校工務處某君、據言關於上院中院房屋亦因年久頗壞、非改建不可、惟因私立南洋模範中學佔用南院、即令稍加修理、亦無相當房屋可以騰用、而所需費用甚大、又籌措不易、該校當局因此深費躊躇云、</p>

<h3 id="c186">（創作與時間）的異議 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 止水</p>
<p>（偉大創作的完成，是需要相當充分的時間，這是歷史上不可磨減的事實。）黄懷白先生這樣告訴我們。他（隨便舉幾個例），是哥德，密爾頓，和拜倫。</p>
<p>歴史是慣會作弄人的。黄先生舉了些可以證明他的理論的例子，我們也可以舉出相反的例，丨丨丨就在黄先生那本（歷史）上頭。</p>
<p>從最古代講起，希臘的三位悲劇家不能不說是偉大罷？伊士奇活了六十九歲（大約），所作悲劇八十餘部；索福克利活了九十歲（大約），所作約九十餘部；（或去百二十三部）由里披底活了七十五歲，也冩了百來種。這三個偉大的悲劇家不能不說是（多産）了罷，然而未嘗因此而不（偉大）。</p>
<p>但希臘倒底太古了，希臘的（歴史）總有點（神話似的），算不得好證據，我們得舉可靠些的（歷史），那麽，司各德在一八一四年台専寫小說，到一八二九年的（干爾斯丁的娜娜），首尾十五年中他冩了十五萬字左右的小說凡二十一部：可說是（有史以來）第一次的（多産）紀錄，然而（偉大）的頭銜並没從司各德身上逃走　大仲馬的文學生涯開始於一八二九年二月的歷史劇（亨利第三），小說（三個火槍手）發表於一八四四年，翌年卽發表（第二部曲）的（二十年以後），倘使說大仲馬在一八三九年就預備估（歷史小說）的，那麽連搜集材料的時間也算在内，也不過五六年光景就冩了兩部（偉犬的著作）。再就他（生産項旺）的時期，丨丨一八四二年到四六年，丨丨來說，首尾僅四年，他冩成了兩個（三部作），而這兩個（三部作）恰就是他最（偉大）的作品。</p>
<p>此外，若巴爾扎克，托爾斯泰，左拉時間來分配，都會使黄櫰白先生覺各（太隨便了）的。然而巴爾扎克他們還是（偉大）的。</p>
<p>可知（創作與時間）這問題，不能死板板來看。卽以黄懷白先生自己所舉的例丨丨哥德的（浮士德）來講，黄先生說他（從二十三歳起到八十三歲止，整整用了五十年的工夫，才完成這部巨著。）然而依我看來，這（五十年）大可研究；我們讀哥德的傳，就知道他並不是（五十年）裏専弄那（浮士德）。一個作家從發意寫一部書到完稿，有延長到很多年的，（歷史）上不僅哥德一人，然而我們不能死板板地就說那部書冩了多少年才成。</p>
<p>黄先生勸現在的作家不要粗製濫造這意見是對的，然而他論證的根據却建築在沙灘上。一個作家倘使没有豐富的生活經騐，縝密尖利的觀察，有一系統的成熟的思想·那他卽使（珍惜時間）到十年工夫寫成一句，也未必就是（偉大）的作品。黄先生撇開了作家的生活經騐等等不問，専從（創作與時間）的死板板的關係上來作論斷，舉了哥德，密爾頓他們爲例，這是難使現在的作家們心服的。或者黄先生所謂（需要相當充分的時間）就指着豐富的生活經騐之獲得，縝密尖利觀察之養成，以及思想的成熟罷？那麽，黄先生的例子是不適用的。從黄先生舉的例子以及對於現在作家的指摘看來，不能不說他的觀念只限於死板板的時間關係。（（九一八）前夜）</p>

<p>— 萬迪鶴</p>
<p>穆時英先生在自由談裏（論悲哀）他說：</p>
<p>（在我們的文學裏邊，悲哀是兩個被人們所愛好着的字：而悲哀這情緒，在靑年的羣裏，也是非常輕鬆地流行着的。李後主李清照納蘭成德的詞，李義山的詩在市塲用各種式樣的版本被販賣着；一些籠罩着廉價的感傷主義的　圍的小說像（少年維特之煩惱），（沉淪），（迷羊），（茵夢湖），（茶花女），甚至完全模倣（茵夢湖）的（夢裏之微笑）之類被廣大的羣衆所珍貴着；（悲哀喲）那樣的語調充斥在靑年們的對話和通信裏邊；沉鬱的臉色被當着詩人氣質直；這些都是近在手邊的例子。）</p>
<p>但是，他的這種見解是不對的；曾經的那樣的事：在某一個時候某種際遇裏的作者，他用悲哀和眼涙，來完成他的藝術作品；這藝術作品也有某持某地的讀者會把它當作珍貴的寳貝看待：然而换了一個時間换了一個地位，那作者的情緒和讀者的口味便會完全不同了；所以在自前把（茵夢湖）等當作珍品的（羣衆），和語調裏充斥了（悲哀喲）的（靑年），恐怕是要被又一種靑年和羣衆當作廢料看待的。</p>

<p>從黑得發酸的賬桌抽屜裏，檢出了一張告示，展開來看一看，裏面是那麽寫着：</p>

<p>（綜上各節，凡你們都要好好遵守，否則，决予嚴懲不貸······）</p>
<p>馮文先生辦認了一會兒，就交給科生瘸手。</p>
<p>（這倒底說些什麽個呀？）科生瘸　還展着告示，没給收起。（村裏人說是抽壯丁。這麽個抽法，恐怕没有人呢。）</p>
<p>（你眞是個蠢貨！）馮文先生，這回覺得應該發脾氣了。（給你講了多少次，不是什麽抽壯丁，是訓練後備兵呀！不過，年紀限定二十以上，四十以下吧了！而且，去訓練二個月，就會回來的呀！）</p>
<p>（哦哦！）本來不很有耐性的冬生瘸手，現在却也學得一付挺和氣面貌。（是去學操練去嗎？眞的學操練學二個月，會給放回來嗎？）</p>
<p>（當然咯！縣長也對我親口說過，區長也對我親口說過，可還賴了你們不成。）</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>（奶呀。人媽睡着啦。）</p>
<p>蹼登蹼登跑過來，一邊說着話·小蘭走進奶奶的跟前。黄老太太抓住好的手，想問她一句什麽話，忽然間覺得手上凉絲絲的，低頭一看，孩子的臉上淌下來眼涙。她不由就驚慌地問：</p>
<p>（你哭什麽，小蘭？）</p>
<p>孩子不出聲，只是搖着頭。</p>
<p>（媽打你了？）</p>
<p>（媽没有。）</p>
<p>（那你是怎麽的？）</p>
<p>（我也不知道怎的，我看媽哭，我也哭了。媽給我看爸爸的像，我想起爸爸來，更止不住哭。）</p>
<p>黄老太太一邊妆撫着孫女一邊拉着孫女的手往外屋走。</p>
<p>媳婦屋子是黑着的，是滅了燈，黄老太太摸黑走到門口，聽到裏面的抽泣聲。孩子喊着：</p>
<p>（媽，奶奶來啦。）</p>
<p>黄老太太覺得一陣心酸，涙如雨般落下來，她一手把住門框，防備身子栽倒了，顫抖着說：</p>
<p>（大媳婦，你，······你······你哭啦？）</p>
<p>媳婦没有答言，她是躺在炕上的，悄悄移動身上，點上燈就下炕了，炕蓆上讓涙水染濕了一大片地方。拉過去孩子的手，她低聲說：</p>
<p>（奶奶，坐一會罷。）</p>
<p>坐定之後，黄老太太問：</p>
<p>（明天是三週年了，小蘭她爸爸三週年，可是你也想起來了？我正要告訴你知道呢。）</p>
<p>（行啦，奶奶，别想這些了，想也想不活，没有用處。）</p>
<p>（你勸我麽？你怎麽還哭呢？）</p>
<p>（我跟你不一樣。）</p>
<p>（我覺得我受的苦痛比你多，說罷：大的死了·二的逃了，日子要我來過，還有你，我總替你難過，我這命怎麽這樣壞，······）</p>
<p>說到這裏，黄老太太讓滿腔的悲痛給塞滿了，再也繼續不下話語，她只在呆呆地望着那一盞豆粒般大的燈火。媳婦和孩子，都把眼光注在一張軍裝男人照片上。</p>
<p>秋天夜晚的鄕村，是静穆的，遇着這荒亂年頭，没有人在夜間趕路，連幾聲狗呌都無從勾起。只有喞喞啾啾呌唤着的秋過，來點綴這沉寂的黑夜，其實，倒不如說是牠們爲了悲嘆生命即將告終，爲自己唱着悲傷之曲。濃烈的榖香，不分晝夜得向外發放着，像是告訴人們，牠們完成了任務。黑沉沉的天空，攏罩着黑沉沉的大地，這個人世，彷彿只是在黑沉中厮混着的。</p>
<p>黄老太太望着燈光，忽然眼前一陣發花，讓她看到三年前長春的一個夜晚，是她的大兒子殉難的一夜，她看到兒子讓日本兵怎樣打死的，還有好多兵，也都喪了性命。火燒，砲轟，把全個營房轟燬了。牠又看到行動近乎胡匪的二兒子，怎樣和一般掮槍的人在一起，人家都呌他們紅胡子，他們自己大吵大嚷說是義勇軍，専心専意要打日本兵，跟日本兵拚命······</p>
<p>黄老太太又想起三年來受到官家的欺負情形：自從大兒子死後，家裏没有當差人，區上警察不像從前那樣高看了，每次攤派捐稅，她們一定要比别人多攤些。還有保衛團常常來要人，要她的二兒子，說他投人匪帮禍害地方，每次來都要多多少少打點一些。裏裏外外這些事，使黄老太太就覺得世是是變得太不像樣了，人心也壞得太厲害了。</p>
<p>（媽，爸爸眞就再也不回來了？）</p>
<p>呆了好一會工夫，小蘭忽然說了一句，黄老太太眨一眨眼。她帶着感傷和憤激的語氣說：</p>
<p>（小蘭，你爸爸讓日本兵打死了，哪能再回來。咳！死的可憐哪。你可别忘這回事，將來好替爸爸報仇！咳！爲什麽他就死了呢，是他該死麽！運命怎麽也不帮助人！）</p>
<p>（聽說那回死很多人，）兒媳說着，眼睛從照片上移到婆母的臉上，（奶奶你總信命運不好，難這說那些死的人都是命運不好麽？我不信這種事情！）</p>
<p>黄老太太答不出兒媳的話，她遇到這種情形，不止這一次，可是她這次還是和往次一樣，不生氣，也不現出難堪樣子，停一會，她倒是轉過話頭說：</p>
<p>（明天不是要上墳麽，那麽，要折紙　呀。）</p>
<p>小菊插進來說：</p>
<p>（我要給爸爸折元寳，折一個又大又黄的金元寳。）</p>
<p>（燒紙燒錢我不大相信這些事，我也没有民情作，我就盼望有人能把日本兵打出去，讓我天天折紙　，夜夜燒高香我都幹。可是三週年了，三個年頭中，就没有聽說過有多少軍隊打過日本兵！我們的人就算白死了，没有人給仲冤報仇了。）</p>
<p>雖是這麽說，她還是　下身子用右手把地櫃中的紙箔掏出來了。</p>
<p>小蘭又喊了一遍，像是很快活似的：</p>
<p>（我要給爸爸折元寳，折一個又大又黄的金元寳。）</p>
<p>黄老太太眼看媳婦又哭了。她覺得很難過，伸了好幾次手，才拿到兩張金箔，丨丨她到後也跟着哭了。</p>

<h3 id="c212">中學校長捲逃 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>上海原是一個騙局的世界，但在敎育界這種騙局還不大多見，前日報載，江蘇海門人施雲錦於本年度暑假創設大江職業中學於本埠塘山路一○三四號，招收學生，校中事務全由乃父施湯民及兄施雲龍，雲成，掌握辦理，施爲××大學畢業生，自任校長，招足學生一百三十餘人。不料施氏父子兄弟竟於八月三十一日（開課前一日）將校内全部財物，席捲一空，逃之夭夭矣。</p>
<p>那一百三十多個學生，當然中墜五里霧中，旣莫明其妙，大起恐慌，於是撰發宣言，呯籲各界，宣言中除揭發上述的一些實情實事外，還有着他們的痛苦的描寫，值得摘錄幾句：（······欲哭無涙，欲投無門，流落在失學的境地，在這社會經濟破産的年頭，我們的家長能把子弟送進中學受敎育，己是很勉强了，現在遭此不幸事件，是如何的痛心呀······）（······與其說是學校舞弊，母寗說是他們家庭串同的騙局，······請求嚴懲這社會上盜匪行爲高等流氓敎靑界之敗類的施雲錦父子······）</p>
<p>這種敎育上的騙局，在這萬惡的上海社會裏，本不是絶對没有，不過過去所扮演的，似乎還只及於那些本以（牟利爲唯一目的）的補習學校或規模很小的衖堂小學，在報章上登一廣告，騙了一筆欵子，就溜之大吉，所受害累的，也還有限，也還是少數。</p>
<p>若這回呢，規模眞大的多了，我常常聽見人家在喊，中或的敎育是破産了，這種事實之演出，眞才震撼了在　　着的中國大衆。堂堂乎的中等學校，堂堂乎的學士校長，而今是做了敎育破産的急先鋒，中國的敎育向那裏去呢？這是應該提出來的問題了。</p>
<p>上海，上海，本是一個（天堂），連上海的敎育也一向是被人視爲（天敎）的，内地的靑年誰都渴慕着來上海！小學生希望來上海進中學·中學生希望來上海進大學·因此上海的敎育的外殻就來得非常發逹，雖是學校像商號一般的櫛比，各校的學生還是如潮而湧，今年全國陷落在水旱交加的深淵裏，内地的學校無不感到學生零落，但上海的仍舊很興隆。</p>
<p>可是上海究竟又像紙糊的老虎，市面的蕭條，只要看看法大馬路的商號的一排排的倒閉，可以想見其他，因此各色的騙局也就演得更兇了。</p>
<p>這中學校長的捲逃，就是個得勁的說明。</p>

<p>— 白舍</p>
<p>雨夜的静安寺路。</p>
<p>年紅燈的光輝在路面上劃下了許多曲折的美麗的倒影，被雨水冲刷過了的路面是一泓清淺的溪流啊！</p>
<p>年來的生活，和都市原是隔離得太遠了，在心眼裏，好像白天是有光亮，夜晚就祇合在黑暗裏挨度，一支燭光的時候，坐對着四壁的昏暗，就會敎自己不敢再多生出一分希望，生活似乎是有規律的，可是總覺太刻板。</p>
<p>想起來，從南國的水鄕來到上海，己是初夏時候的事了，都市裏一切高速度的動力，曾給與我不少的誘惑，在旅途中也由而生出了許多的幻念，興奮自然也是不免的，可是到了上海之後，生活便和理想相異其趣了，我眞不懂理想爲什麽老是這麽不能兌現，爲着肚皮的奔走就敎我好久喘不過一口氣來，而高速度的一切正映照得自己的遲鈍不每啊</p>
<p>鄕居子一個月，對於上海依然是想慕的，往往望着燈光灼紅了的上海的天空，便對着上海生出了過分的默頌，但是這一刻閒步在這都市的核心裏，却又是木然無所感應了，雨絲，這時是密密地從雨傘的破縫裏洒進來，走過席夢思的廣告牌前，席夢思上的女人也淋濕了，懶懶地在笑。</p>
<p>轉過了彎，跑馬廳的大鐘指着七點了，把眼光再放遠去，那不就是上海的夜市嗎？大公司的屋尖的高塔上，正有着紅的藍的綫條在跑着，我們該會想到它的懷抱中夜遊大的嬌媚的眼吧，可是雨益發大了啊。</p>
<p>我在傾盆似的大雨裏走着，我笑着，因爲我是没有目的也没有希望的，雨天是顯示着特有的情緻的丨丨莫非我在尋覓着一着苦味的詩嗎？</p>
<p>醉沉在銀宮裏男人和女人们這時正被那張美麗的闊嘴吐出了，劇情的體味還没有完呢，却迎頭碰上了這一陣驟雨，歡娱是難是久長喲！</p>
<p>雨點愈益密而且驟了，如幻一樣的年紅之市更是蒙上了一層夢一樣的輕紗，嵌在深碧的天空的年紅市招，漸漸地迷糊，迷糊到不可辨認了。是的，上海就是這麽一個迷糊得不可辨認的東西啊</p>
<p>走到寓所的時候，衣衫己經濕得很透了，進房時，一陣濕悶的潮氣直冲向腦門，雨聲還是激劇地響着，等天晴了的時候，秋又將老了幾分了，我臨睡時還這樣地想着。</p>
<h3 id="c214">廢話連篇 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 文丐</p>
<p>曾經受過飢餓的人，才知道飢餓的難過。飽食的人你問他飢餓的感覺是怎樣，他連想像都想像不出。就是相像得出，也决不會怎樣的眞實。</p>
<p>從前有一個皇帝，他聽見他的臣子報告說，（百姓在飢餓着没有飯吃，）他一點不猶豫地問，（怎麽不敎他們吃粥呢？）飽食的人是以爲没有飯吃的人不吃粥的，其實能够一天吃一餐粥的人，境况還並不算壞。連一天吃一餐粥都夢想不到的人，在這世界上才多着呢。</p>
<p>又有一個富貴人家的公子哥兒，他一天到晚都在吃零食吃得飽了，他的母親還一天五餐强迫他吃飯吃粥，他對人家說道：（吃飯眞是活受罪！）飽食的人對於飢餓是陌生的，他們自然要討厭吃飯了。</p>
<p>Ｓemonoy的小說飢餓，對於飢餓的人們那一種生理的心理的變態，算是描寫得細膩不過的了：可是你如果看過了卓别麟的影片洶金記，那一種表演更可以使你感動。一個人一到飢餓的時候，他生理上起了變化，眼晴也花了，他屢次將同伴看成了一隻大母雞，他要吃大母雞，可是定晴看來却是他的同伴。這是多麽深刻的表現？</p>
<h3 id="c215">躑躅 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>

<p>晚霞是在漸漸地漸漸地底隱去了，那被落日的金輝渲染着的西方，有無數的歸烏在向那茫茫的天末，一行行地飛去；啊！在這傍晚的時分，甚麽都需要歸宿的此刻呵！那勞苦的近郊的農婦，不是拖着她們疲乏的靈魂，走向她們的歸宿丨丨那邊林叢裏躱着的家吧！</p>
<p>在這裏，雖然是免避了都市底煩囂的製擊，那些市井中固有的聲音的包圍，但它脫離了這罪惡的渲染，然那些傍晚時分和天亮時分，工廠放汽的聲音，是實難逃避惡運的蹂躪！</p>
<p>烏鴉有時呌了一兩聲凄切的聲音，在這黄昏的落葉底蕭蕭裏，輕柔的拂拂底晚風的動蕩之中，在這裏它是波不動這自然的幽咏，然而在我的心坎裏，却劃下了一個悲哀的陰影。一個天涯淪落的孤零的靈魂裏，失了歸宿的悲凄底異鄕的飄泊者，在一個這樣孕滿了悲慘的都市底近郊，那麽地失了魄的躑躅着。假如躑躅是不需要麵包的話，那麽我情願如斯躑躅着，然而餓火的燃燒的衣衾的需要，與乎歸宿的祈求······人是不能够那麽地夢想的吧？</p>
<p>天漸漸地更黑了，昏暗底魔紗，是將要把這大地裏去了。然而我這躑躅的幽魂，是將怎樣地安置自身？那邊林中嗎？不。這茫茫的曠野，誰能料没有野獸底來臨？那邊人家嗎？誰又是你的朋友，誰又是你的親戚？况且在這廣漠無情的人羣，就是親友，不一樣的是趨附有錢的人？雖道這不相識的人們，會對你這乞丐也似的人憐憫？那邊摩天樓底下是更去不是呵，失業和没有麵包的流浪的人是太多了！躑躅着吧，躑躅著吧，在這漫漫的黑暗裏，讓他翻個觔斗去呵！</p>

<p>— 莎菲</p>
<p>秋天了呵！</p>
<p>踏着梧桐的落葉，在黄昏的餘暉中我獨自走過那修長的小堤。那幾年來我久居的小樓在望的時候，脚步兒像倒拖似的放慢了；陰暗的心呵，久鎖在那陰暗的樓中底陰暗的心呵！</p>
<p>靑春這樣地浪費了，五年的悠長的日子！</p>
<p>牠握着我的手幽幽地說，五年前，愛護我的妹妹和我的小樓，像愛護着我一樣？我無涙地含着，彷彿秋空裏失羣的孤雁，將悲哀遺留在人間，她含知停止子最後的呼吸。</p>
<p>於是我和一個十二歲的女孩守護着這小樓，一個入定的老僧似的；忘了世界，忘了朋友。從窗口中望着桃花的開放，零落；在半夜裏聽着雷聲的怒號；一陣緊似一陣的秋風帶來了白皚皚的雪花；我凝視着好的像片問女孩子；</p>
<p>（又是一年了？）</p>
<p>（一年了！姊夫，我們什麽時候離開這裏呢？）</p>
<p>一對和像片上同樣的黑眼珠在我面的閃　　　（秋雁歸來的时候，）</p>
<p>女孩子猛地拉了我的手，出了小　，經過長提，到她墓前。</p>
<p>那地上的靑草又是靑綠可愛了；黄鶯兒歸來了，唱着迷人的春曲；墓碑上的塵灰己被柳絲拂凈；但是那個穿白衣裙的女人爲什麽哭得那樣悲傷呢？</p>
<p>我無端仰起頭來，白雲追逐着白雲，織成一幅美麗的天空。</p>
<p>（姐姐，）女孩子扶着墓碑說：（秋雁歸來的時候，我們要離這裏了，你不嫌寂寞嗎，姐姐，我送給你一束小花。）</p>
<p>她採了墓前的野花，放上石級，低頭注視着自家的鞋尖。</p>
<p>憂怨，悽凉，襲上女孩子的心頭；但是，但是秋雁歸來的时候，她耐不住小樓的孤寂，離開了我，離開了姐姐的墓地，走了，一年没有她的消息。</p>
<p>秋天了呵！</p>
<p>我扶了手扙，懷着沉重的心，踏着沉重的步伐，獨自到墓地去。墓碑經了風雨的侵襲，己不是那樣光澤有緻了，野花的枯枝早己被秋風帶走了，像那枯黄的梧桐葉一樣；像那對大的黑眼珠一樣，眼前是荒凉，寂寞，只有那穿白衣　女人的哭聲陪着我無滬的悲哀。</p>

<p>— 柔蕪</p>
<p>光陰只是無情地像流水一般地逝過去，計算起來父親和母親己經死去十年了。</p>
<p>父親是和一般地父親差不多，是比母親强幹。而又嚴厲的，他没有母親那般和孩子們打鑼打鼓的心情，他是終日在生活中掙扎着的。而母親呢？正和父親相反，是仁慈而又柔情的。她愛我，就像愛她自己的生命一般。當我每天下午從學校裏放學歸來時，她便要放下手中所做的一切事情，來抱着我坐在她的懷裏，熱烈地吻着我。有時她呌我撅起了小嘴兒，給她輕輕地敲着，接着她便要（兒呀！乖呀！寳貝，心肝一地呌出連串痛愛的詞句來，那樣子，就像要把我活生生地吞下肚去似的。然而母親這般地愛我，倒使我不大親近她來，而那不十分愛我的父親，反倒使我歡喜常常地接近他。可是父親愛我的情緒趕母親的三分之一，都趕不上，有時我很親切地站在他的身邊，想他來抱我一時，或摸我一下，最低的限度連看我一眼都不可能。他戴着副老花的眼鏡，縐起眉毛，擺着一副　肅的面孔，一手夾着一枝毛筆，一手弄着算盤珠。臉皮一抽一動地好像在默念着什麽。一時，　出不高興的樣子，一時，又露出很愉快臉色來。只一個勁兒在算他那勞什子的帳。這時我討不着父親的愛，便要捉住母親來出氣了，倒在母親的懷裏，握着我弱小的拳頭，没命地打着母親的胸膛，可是母親並不怎樣來止住我，也不呌痛，反而微笑着對我說：（好寳寳，打重一點，打重一點。）</p>
<p>她似乎給我打得很痛快地樣子，結果我的手打酸了。一肚子氣没有出，反倒增加了我的氣熖來。我没有辦法，只好躱在母親的懷裏，莫明其妙地痛哭起來了。這情形就常常地使母親痛苦着，不知所以然來，她這時便要急得滿頭大汗，縐着眉毛道：（寳貝！有什麽地方不舒服嗎？要買什麽嗎？您說！娘替您上街去買。）</p>
<p>母親這般地說了，我哭得更凶，更哭得起勁了。一直我要鬧到我疲倦極了。睡去時才止。爲了這事，母親就要時時刻刻的痛苦地嘆息着。</p>
<p>這樣的事情，而今想起，只有惘然，只有不自主地落着涙呵！那器厲的父親和仁慈的母親，已於十年前相繼去世了。丨丨一個被土匪殘酷地打死，一個是了急　在　不時内使死去了。同時，我童年　心　，己不知　　到那兒去。唉！兒時的一切己不復可得，徃事是不　　　呵！</p>

<p>丨丨懷南國故人丨丨</p>
<p>秋天在南國是龍眼上市的可愛的季節。</p>
<p>那遼遠的海，那遼遠的對岸，深葬着靑年時侯金色的夢，金色的戀思。那邊一切的風物綫都是够美媚的：天是碧玉樣一色蔚藍，海也是蔚藍的，躺在温静的陽光底下泛起無邊的温静的漪漣。每當黄昏的時候，帶着一顆輕快的心挽着女人徊徉於龍眼樹的濃蔭叢中，望望對面的夕照映入海心，暈暈地織成絢爛的霞彩，聽脚邊的微彼因不大的風而不時嚙啃着沙灘發出蟋蟀的微妙的聲息，一下又退回去，不久又披上來。就聆着天然的着樂節奏似地。</p>
<p>沈醉在那未詩境般的黄昏裏，肩挨肩地，絮絮的說着一些糖甜的私情話，往往就這樣地來了，却忘記歸去，坐在石凳上，直到月亮從樹蔭空凶瀉下銀光的深夜······</p>
<p>秋天又來了啊、我的金色的夢，和金色的戀思呢？</p>
<p>身子不知什麽時日流落在這異地裏、而靈魂則仍然飛翔到那遼遠的遼遠的海的那邊。海的那邊曾留下過我的私情的踪跡，海的那邊己經葬去了金色的夢，金色的戀思，也許還加上一層厚厚的泥沙，一層厚厚的歲月的泥沙。</p>
<p>龍眼的蜜味和龍眼核似的烏黑的珠子啊！</p>
<p>一想起了南國的秋天，總不由地便想起了養活在煦暖的陽光裏邊的有龍眼核一樣動人的烏黑的珠子的琳琳，琳琳有一支音樂風的婉變的嗓子，烏黑的眼珠子而又烏黑的頭髮。以及一個醖釀着秋天裏的春天的戀的節候夢的清淡的笑</p>
<p>但是琳琳那里去了呢？琳琳的心有没有跟着秋天生變化。我知道琳琳的心永遠是愉快，榆伕地。</p>
<p>因爲琳琳是適宜於生活在煦暖的陽光下的小雀兒。</p>
<p>但是流浪者的旅程和沙漠般的心境，一顆沙漠那樣荒凉的心和一顆愉快的心是被重重的山重重的海遠遠隔阻着了</p>
<p>幸福的時間像天邊的流星沉殁了。琳琳，三個秋天後重見的約會現在己不止三年。這約會也許將成爲永生的遺憾吧。鐵塊的命運開不出，美麗的果子，除了在夢裏　着悵惘的涙水作幻景的沈醉，我還冀求什麽呢。我己準備無言地獨嚼着生的苦計，駄着磔刑的十字架，從此毁棄世間所有的憧憬。只的你琳琳，你的容顔在我灰民的心幕上却永不凋殘，永爲不朽的靈魂的雕像。不過我願意你是愉快地，愉快地生活在南國煦暖的陽光底下，愉快地。</p>
<p>不願你也因愁惱而使靑春太速地枯謝呵！琳琳。</p>
<p>這長長的日子，長長的流浪生涯，我是一點感覺没有，歡娱没有，就連幻想也没有。每天，都是如此的！瞧日頭浮上來，沉下去，一個人聽着自己落日的喪鈴隨着時間的足音寂寂地從心坎上，從耳朶邊，駛過去，駛過去我没一絲感觸。祇是默默地太息着，太息着。秋天在南國是可愛的。可是秋天只能給我一度的理壓，琳琳，你呢？</p>

<p>Chen Lifu Reports, Hoping the People Will Not Despair</p>
<p>Half-Masting Flags and Cessation of Entertainment and Banquets Throughout the Country</p>
<p>Executive Yuan Meeting Attendees Observe Moment of Silence to Mark the Pain</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This morning at 9:00 AM on the 18th, the Central Party Headquarters held a commemoration of the third anniversary of the September 18th National Crisis in the main auditorium. Attendees included Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Hong Ludong, Wang Luyi, Gu Zhenggang, Li Ciwen, Zhu Peide, Wang Qi, Li Zonghuang, Jiao Yitang, Zhu Jiqing, Xiao Jishan, Ji Liang, Ke Xing'e, and representatives from various agencies and party headquarters staff, totaling approximately 700 people. Standing Committee member Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, a solemn three-minute moment of silence was observed. Chen Lifu then delivered a report, stating briefly that the national crisis had persisted for three years. Besides intensifying our efforts, there was no need for empty talk. It must be understood that all living beings seek survival and advance in a curved manner, sometimes reaching the highest point and sometimes falling to the lowest. The survival of a nation is similar. As long as we do not abandon ourselves at the highest and strongest times, and do not despair at the lowest and weakest times, we will certainly stand forever in the world and there is no reason to perish. Our national crisis did not arise overnight; its origins are long-standing. Resolving the national crisis cannot be achieved in a single day. I only ask that the people of the country, during this time of national crisis, have confidence that they can rely on their thousands of years of inherent history and culture and strive forward without despair. Why worry about not being able to turn weakness into strength? The Premier has repeatedly stated that China speaks of the Kingly Way. The so-called Kingly Way is not only to seek the survival of our own nation, but also to seek survival and peace together with all of humanity. The Premier, based on China's inherent morality, proposed the eight characters of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, advocacy of righteousness, and promotion of peace as the path to survival. We must adhere to and not overstep these principles. The current international situation is extremely perilous. All the so-called world powers are advancing on their erroneous paths. If our country can truly base itself on thousands of years of moral culture and strive along the correct path to survival indicated by the Premier, we can not only seek our own survival and resolve the national crisis, but also bear the responsibility of resolving the crises of humanity worldwide. I hope that the people of the country will never despair. After the speech, it was past 10:00 AM and the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e10">China Fails to be Elected as a Non-Permanent Member of the League of Nations Council <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>According to a European telegram from the 17th, China has been replaced by Turkey for a seat as a non-permanent member of the League of Nations Council, which it was seeking to retain.</p>
<p>At a time when the Northeast is still being trampled under the iron heels of Japan, the League of Nations, which has always been known for its peace and justice, has rejected us in this way. No wonder the people of the country express disappointment upon hearing this news. However, the League of Nations is not a single, simple country, but an international organization formed by the gathering of many countries. Therefore, its will cannot but be transferred according to the will of these countries. Western countries know this well. Therefore, they often form long-term alliances within the scope of the League of Nations charter to obtain a victory in the number of votes. Since the September 18th Incident, our country has rarely had individual contacts with countries that can influence the will of the League of Nations. Even this time, when competing for a seat as a non-permanent member of the Council, it is presumed that there was a lack of sufficient preparation in advance. Its failure cannot be entirely blamed on others. Furthermore, the trust in the League of Nations by our country, from top to bottom, has been excessive. In the early days of the September 18th Incident, the people believed that the League of Nations would be able to impose sanctions on the Japanese atrocities. As a result, they were bound to delay and miss opportunities. This also shows the lack of understanding of international relations among the people of our country. The pain of a weak country having no diplomacy has been experienced by us all. Are the people of the country still dreaming?</p>
<p>However, as far as the League of Nations is concerned, it is the League of Nations that has failed our country, and we have not failed the League of Nations. Today's foreign telegrams quoted a European evening newspaper editorial, saying that although China has repeatedly had disputes with the Secretariat in the past Far East disputes, it has never been able to achieve its ambitions. However, China has never followed in Japan's footsteps and severed relations with Geneva. A country that is so loyal to the League of Nations is still not understood by the League of Nations and has actually rejected its well-founded request. This is truly incomprehensible. This is indeed a theory that fits the facts. The people of our country also clearly know that the League of Nations' inability to help us is half due to the general situation. However, we believe that our country has done its best for the League of Nations and has an important relationship with the Far East. We still hope that the League of Nations will ultimately extend its justice and wash away its previous state of fearing the strong and bullying the weak. Unexpectedly, it was abandoned like a remnant. This is why we cannot help but express our disappointment.</p>
<p>Today, the people of our country can awaken with determination. In the world, no matter what country, if it encounters foreign trouble, all the people of the country, regardless of their status, will eliminate partisan opinions and eliminate emotional disputes in order to face the national crisis together. If the country does not exist, how can the dignity of parties and individuals be preserved? Therefore, today, our country must abandon all prejudices, gather the entire country, unite as one, and if the interior can be strong, there will be no need to ask for anything from other countries. A wise man of old said, "A country must insult itself before others insult it." If we are constantly striving for self-improvement, then all the bad impressions in the international community can be eliminated. We do not seek help from others, but others help themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that today's failure to compete for a seat on the council is not the time for the people of the country to hate the League of Nations. We must know that the excessive belief in the League of Nations in the past and the hatred of the League of Nations today are both due to a lack of understanding of international relations. The proposal to withdraw from the League of Nations is even more excessive. This mere seat on the council is not enough to make us happy if we get it, nor is it enough to make us sad if we lose it. If we want to withdraw from the League of Nations because of a matter of face, then our country has lost face in many things. Can we really calculate each one? Therefore, for the sake of our country: (1) We must painfully change our own shortcomings and strive to enrich our national power. (2) We must build international credibility to lay a good foundation for the future of diplomacy. Apart from this, everything else is a trivial matter.</p>

<p>It Gladdens the Enemy and Saddens Those Close to Us</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Expresses Regret</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the League of Nations General Assembly's rejection on the 17th of our country's re-election as a non-permanent councilor, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson issued a statement on the 18th as follows:</p>
<p>It is deeply regrettable that our country failed to obtain re-election as a non-permanent member of the Executive Council at yesterday's League of Nations General Assembly due to insufficient votes. According to the resolutions of the League of Nations General Assembly in 1922 and 1923, a member state requesting re-election as a non-permanent councilor must first be approved by a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly before it can compete in the election. Compared to a general election, which only requires a majority vote of the General Assembly, the difficulty is immeasurable. Before our country applied for re-election, we were not unaware of this significant procedural difficulty. However, we ultimately resolutely applied, precisely because our country is a major power in East Asia, and has maintained close cooperation and enthusiastic support for the League of Nations. It was reasonable to expect that the League of Nations would uphold fairness and grant us re-election. However, the League of Nations failed to see this and did not provide us with sympathy and support, causing intense disappointment throughout our country. This is not only China's misfortune, but also not a blessing for the League of Nations. Why do we say this? The League of Nations is an international organization of the majority of countries in the world, its purpose is to maintain peace and justice, and its scope includes various regions and nationalities. According to the resolution of September 29, 1922, when the League of Nations General Assembly elects non-permanent councilors, it should take into account the world's major regions, nationalities, religions, cultures, and sources of wealth, and make appropriate allocations. However, the result of this election is that no East Asian country has a representative on the Executive Council, making the League of Nations almost a purely European international organization. This has to be said to be a major loss for the League of Nations itself. Furthermore, China, which has always been known for its love of the League of Nations, has been disappointed and retreated. How can this not gladden those who hate the League of Nations and sadden those who are close to it? Before the election, some in our country's public opinion advocated that, given our country's important position, we should demand a permanent councilor seat. The results of this vote further strengthen our determination not to demand a permanent councilor seat. If the League of Nations takes into account justice and the soundness of its own organization, it will certainly find a way to satisfy our hopes. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>The League of Nations has an Obligation to Find a Remedy</p>
<p>Turkey's Election was Aided by Britain</p>
<p>Our People Should Know to Strive for Self-salvation!</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the League of Nations' rejection of our country's re-election as a non-permanent councilor, Guo Taiqi made a statement to the Central News Agency correspondent in Geneva today, saying that China's failure to be elected this time has had a negative impact on both the League of Nations and China. This is tantamount to an explanation of the policy of isolating Asia and the policy of cooperation between the victorious East and West. The League of Nations itself and those who uphold international justice have an obligation to find a remedy for this loss. Our people are indeed extremely disappointed by this failure, but after being stimulated by this, they should know to strive for self-salvation, etc. All circles here are very shocked by China's failure to be elected and suspect that Turkey's election was aided by Britain.

<h3 id="e13">Failure in Councilor Election Does Not Harm China's Prestige <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>League of Nations Rejects Re-election Request</p>
<p>German Newspapers Express Deep Regret for Our Country</p>
<p>(London) The London media believes that China's failure to be re-elected as a non-permanent councilor at this League of Nations General Assembly does not mean that there is international disapproval of China. Even if China is not elected, its prestige will not be harmed. In addition, some people believe that China's failure to be elected is due to Japan's machinations, which is also not a true understanding. In short, China's failure to be elected is only because the Executive Council wants Asian countries to take turns holding a councilor seat. As for one party to the Far East dispute being able to occupy a seat on the Executive Council, although it is welcomed by all parties, continuous incumbency of a non-permanent councilor should be avoided as a precedent. This is the general wish of the League of Nations. Some quarters here express regret that China has always firmly supported the League of Nations but now sees its election efforts fail, such as the League of Nations Union. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since China's failure in the election for the League of Nations Council, German newspapers have expressed regret for China. For example, a certain evening newspaper published an editorial today stating that the League of Nations General Assembly's rejection of China's request for re-election to a councilor seat is sufficient to prove that the League of Nations is controlled by imperialists and opportunists. The newspaper further pointed out that although China has repeatedly clashed with the Secretariat in past Far Eastern disputes and has often been unable to achieve its goals, China has never followed in Japan's footsteps and severed relations with Geneva. This kind of loyalty to the League of Nations is not understood by the League of Nations, which has brazenly rejected its well-founded request. Spain was re-elected with a large majority of votes, which is truly incomprehensible. (National News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>

Once wounded, it was tantamount to death or disability, with no hope of recovery. It was a miserable situation. Jiang Huibiao, a messenger of the pseudo-Fifth Division, Fourteenth Regiment, confessed that the commander of the Fifth Division was wounded in the left hand by artillery fire on the 29th, and the political commissar of the division, Chen Ajin, was also killed by artillery fire on the same day. Luo Bitong, a pseudo-battalion commander, confessed that since the implementation of our blockade policy, the officers and soldiers of the bandits have suffered material hardship for a long time and have gradually become aware of this, with increasing numbers of deserters and even suicides. The people of the Soviet area are gradually becoming estranged, which is a fatal blow to the bandits. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>General Assembly Delayed for Three Hours Yesterday</p>
<p>Formal Approval Expected</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly was originally scheduled to open at 3:30 p.m. today to welcome the first Soviet delegation. This meeting has now been postponed to 6:00 p.m. The Soviet delegation will be headed by Foreign Commissar Litvinov, with the Soviet Ambassador to Finland, Stein, Counselor of the Embassy in France, Rosenburg, and Legal Advisor to the Foreign Commissariat, Igoriapuv, as representatives to the General Assembly. In addition, there will be several experts. The delay in opening the General Assembly today seems to be because the head of the Soviet delegation, Litvinov, is still in Evian, France, drafting his speech with his staff, which is not yet completed. It also takes considerable time to complete the full powers procedures and contact the Moscow government. International observers believe that the issue of Soviet admission to the League of Nations has been thoroughly debated in the Sixth Committee, and there will be no further lengthy debate before its formal approval by the General Assembly today.

<p>Vote – 38 Votes in Favor of Russian Membership</p>
<p>Result – 3 Countries Against, 7 Abstaining</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Political Committee held a meeting today, and the audience was extremely crowded. After the meeting began, the small country group severely criticized Soviet Russia, but still decided to recommend to the General Assembly that Soviet Russia be accepted into the League of Nations. There were 38 countries in favor, 3 countries against, and 7 countries abstaining. It was found that this motion was a routine matter for the Political Committee, and no one expected any public attacks. It was not until the meeting was about to begin that they became aware of this.</p>

<p>Portuguese Foreign Minister da Matae was the first to slander the Soviet Russian government, saying that Soviet Russia's economic, political, and moral concepts are completely different from those of Portugal. If Soviet Russia joins the League of Nations, it will completely betray the principles of civilized countries. Therefore, although Portugal did not vote when Soviet Russia was voted as a permanent councilor on Saturday, it will vote against when the General Assembly votes to accept Soviet Russia into the League of Nations.

<h3 id="e28">Switzerland Follows Up with Opposition <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Swiss representative Motta followed, saying that Switzerland is the only country in the world that has joined the League of Nations through a referendum. Since the establishment of the League of Nations, Switzerland has advocated that the League of Nations should include all countries in the world. In 1920, he (Motta) gave a speech saying that he hoped that Soviet Russia could join, but the Swiss people have always opposed recognizing Soviet Russia. He believes that a government that practices communism and strives to spread communism is not compatible with the qualifications of a member of the League of Nations. The major powers have made expedient arguments on this matter, saying that after Soviet Russia joins the League of Nations and gets closer to other countries, its doctrines may change. The governments of Britain, France, and Italy have said to their friendly countries that the time for the Soviet Union to join the League has matured. These three countries certainly have this right. The mediation of the three countries for Soviet Russia to join the League is based on confidence and does not force other countries in any way. This is what we should say. However, Switzerland finds it difficult to agree with the views of these three countries. After Soviet Russia joins the League, various important issues will arise for debate in the Executive Council of the League of Nations, such as the issues of Georgia and Ukraine, which will not be eliminated due to the passage of time, and there are many people who advocate for them. Switzerland will also question Soviet Russia about anti-religious propaganda and ask it to explain.</p>

<p>Following Motta was Belgian Foreign Minister Jaspar, who said that Belgium has not yet restored diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, the reason for which is the same as that stated by the Swiss representative. The reason is that Belgian people previously had 161 enterprises in Soviet Russia, worth hundreds of millions of gold francs, all of which were confiscated by Soviet Russia and none of which have been returned. However, Belgium will only abstain from voting on this Soviet Russian admission to the League of Nations and will not vote against it, so as not to hinder the efforts to maintain world peace and European order.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Argentina Claims No Diplomatic Relations with Russia <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Next, Argentinian representative Cantilo spoke, Cantilo's words were simple, only stating that since the Argentinian embassy in Moscow was subjected to violent treatment, there have been no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, so Argentina is abstaining from voting this time. Then, Dutch representative Viscount de Lovinfosse delivered a simple statement, saying that the Netherlands will vote against Soviet Russia's admission to the League of Nations, for the same reasons as those stated by Switzerland, Belgium, and Argentina.</p>
<h3 id="e31">French Foreign Minister Engages in a Verbal Battle with the Crowd <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>At this point, French Foreign Minister Barthou took the stage to present his views, saying that he takes the League of Nations Covenant as a guide, a witness, and a guarantee. Barthou then praised the words of Swiss representative Motta, saying that Motta had said that the mediation of Britain, France, and Italy for Soviet Russia to join the League was based entirely on confidence and did not force other countries in any way.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Off-site Negotiations are Not New <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Barthou continued, saying that conducting talks off-site has become a traditional method in the League of Nations and is not a new beginning this time. In 1926, when Germany joined the League, the same procedure was adopted. At that time, the time spent in off-site talks was even longer than this time. The compromise for the Saar issue was also reached through off-site talks. Barthou also said that if Soviet Russia is admitted to the League, it is willing to abide by all the obligations stated in the League of Nations Covenant. This is the first time that Soviet Russia has said this. Barthou acknowledged that there has been a long period of disputes between Soviet Russia and the League of Nations in the past, but the League of Nations has always wanted to make its Covenant's first article a reality, as the founders wished the League of Nations to encompass the whole world, and the first article of the Covenant also clearly expresses this. Moreover, Swiss representative Motta also advocated Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations in 1920, but only with some reservations. The question today is whether the time for Soviet Russia to join the League has arrived.</p>
<h3 id="e33">French and Russian Debts Have Not Been Resolved <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Barthou then replied to the points made by Motta and Jaspar criticizing Soviet Russia, saying that Switzerland and Belgium certainly each have their reasons for dissatisfaction, but does France not have them? For example, the debt issue between France and Russia has never been resolved. If what the two representatives said is true, then could France not also oppose Soviet Russia because of the debt issue?</p>
<h3 id="e34">Everything Should be Viewed from a Broader Perspective <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>But that is not what is being discussed today. We should view everything from a broader perspective, which is peace. The interests of the League of Nations are one with peace. Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations is beneficial to the League of Nations, and thus beneficial to peace. As for Soviet Russia's domestic politics, the Soviet system has changed since Lenin. This request for accession is clear evidence of this. We ask it for guarantees, and Soviet Russia does not treat us with vague words, which shows that Soviet Russian doctrines are changing. All of this does not mean that we want to interfere in Russia's internal affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e35">The Consequences of Shutting the Door are Serious <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Barthou continued, (The League of Nations was originally established for the whole world, and now there is a country with a population of 180 million that is willing to join as a member in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant and does not set its own conditions. How can we regard this as a trivial matter and ignore it? This country asks to join a European international organization. Are you going to shut the door on it and let it suffer this insult, turning from bitterness to hatred of us? Where will rejecting Soviet Russia lead it? At this point, I do not wish to say any more.) At this point, Barthou said that the reason why some representatives oppose Soviet Russia is due to the incompatibility of doctrines. In fact, our recognition of Soviet Russia's accession to the League is a political necessity and there is no mysticism involved. The Portuguese representative said that isolation is the beginning of war. This is very true. Barthou also said, (If you reject Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations, then there will be serious events in the future that I do not wish to predict. Are you going to bear this responsibility?</p>
<h3 id="e36">World Peace Truly Depends On It <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>As I see it, Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations is beneficial to the League of Nations and to European peace, and even world peace. Think carefully about it. Motta said that history is the judge, but I say that posterity can also judge.) Barthou also stated that he supports the views of Britain and Italy and said that of the European countries, 22 have recognized Soviet Russia, and only five have not. If we consider the status of the 22 countries and their qualifications to represent Western civilization, then it is no exaggeration to say that all of Europe supports Soviet Russia. Barthou concluded by saying, (Precedent is not a reason. I have stated France's reasons. We dare to bear this responsibility to the world. Now that Soviet Russia wants to join hands with you, I hope you will not reject it from the international organization. If you vote in favor, then your enthusiasm and foresight for upholding world peace will be seen by the world.) (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) At the meeting of the Sixth Committee, the representatives of Switzerland, Belgium, Argentina, and the Netherlands, and French Foreign Minister Barthou spoke in succession. Then, British representative Lord Great Eden delivered a brief speech, saying that British foreign policy has always been based on the League of Nations, so it will spare no effort to support any action whose intention is to make the League of Nations have a (globally universal) nature. Italian representative Aloisi said that Italy was the first country to recognize the Soviet government. He, representing Italy, fully agreed with what Barthou and Eden said and also advocated that the Soviet Union join the League of Nations.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Czechoslovakia and Canada Echo Their Support <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Czech representative Foreign Minister Beneš stated that the League of Nations should have a (globally universal) nature and that European peace also needs to be consolidated, but this is not possible without Soviet cooperation. He will therefore vote in favor of the Soviet Union's accession and firmly believes that not only European peace but also global peace truly depends on it. Canadian representative Skelton said that the Soviet Union and Canada have similar political principles and have several that are not adopted by other countries. He also acknowledged that the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations is a necessary measure to maintain world peace, so he decided to vote in favor.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Poland and Turkey Speak of Neighborly Relations <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Polish representative Foreign Minister Beck said that Poland and the Soviet Union are neighboring countries and have a close relationship. They have signed many diplomatic documents proving the two countries' desire for peace.</p>
<p>Turkish representative Foreign Minister Rüştü said that Turkey has always hoped that the Soviet Union would join the League of Nations. The territories of Turkey and Russia are adjacent, and they have had friendly relations for fifteen years. During this period, the Soviet Union has continuously devoted itself to peace. For all these reasons, Turkey believes that the Soviet Union's accession is the most reliable factor for the League of Nations and world peace.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Chairman Concludes the Debate <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>After Rüştü finished speaking, no other country's representatives spoke in succession. Chairman Madariaga stood up and gave a speech, saying that after the Soviet Union joins, the (globally universal) nature of the League of Nations will be further advanced, which is truly gratifying.</p>

<p>Then a draft resolution was proposed and put to a vote. The text stated (The Sixth Committee, because the delegation of thirty countries sent an invitation to the Soviet Union on the fifteenth of this month, and the four countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden also sent letters to the Soviet Union, and because the Soviet Union has already responded, and in view of the Soviet Union's willingness to abide by the various obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant, hereby recommends to the General Assembly that the Soviet Union be allowed to join the League of Nations). The chairman then used the roll-call method to conduct the vote. The three opposing countries were Portugal, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The seven abstaining countries were Belgium, Luxembourg, Argentina, Venezuela, Paraguay, Nicaragua, and Cuba. The three absent countries were Uruguay, Finland, and Panama. The other thirty-eight countries all voted in favor. The League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to meet on Tuesday afternoon, at which time Chairman Sandler will invite Madariaga to speak, followed by an invitation to the Soviet delegation to attend. It is expected that the Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov will deliver a speech to thank the chairman and the General Assembly. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>Quietly Awaiting Assembly Vote</p>
<p>Preparing to Take the Stage</p>
<p>(Geneva) A Soviet Russian delegation of forty people suddenly arrived here at night. Most of the delegation members have been waiting in the upper Savoy area near Geneva for several days. The Russian delegation was guarded by a large police escort along the way. Upon reaching the shores of Lake Geneva, they all stayed in large apartments near the League of Nations Secretariat, quietly awaiting the official vote of the League of Nations General Assembly this afternoon before carrying out their duties as a member state of the League of Nations.

<h3 id="e43">Russia Could Assume Chairmanship at League of Nations Meeting Next Spring <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Alphabetical Order Should Rotate to Russia</p>
<p>Saar Vote Causes Concern for Germany</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to observations from people here, when the League of Nations convenes its next session in January of next year, Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov is likely to be appointed as chairman. According to international custom, the chairmanship of each General Assembly is determined by the alphabetical order of the countries' names in French, and the representative of a certain country is nominated as chairman. As the current meeting is chaired by Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, the first letter of the Czech Republic's name in French is 'T', while the first letter of the Soviet Union's name in French is 'U'. Therefore, according to the order, the Soviet Russian representative is expected to be nominated as chairman for the next League of Nations meeting. However, the chairman has considerable influence over the proceedings of the meeting. Therefore, the Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations at this time means it must already be eyeing the chairman's position. Furthermore, when the League of Nations convenes its meeting next year, it will be at a critical juncture in resolving the Saar issue. Disputes after the Saar issue vote are also expected. Therefore, it would be a pity if the chairmanship were to fall into the hands of someone not deeply familiar with League of Nations affairs. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the Soviet Union joins the League of Nations, its Foreign Commissar Litvinov may serve as chairman when the League of Nations Administrative Council holds its meeting from January to May next year. German newspapers cannot help but be concerned about this matter, as the Saar issue is to be resolved in the spring of next year. The Evening Post stated that there is a more serious matter, namely that the Socialist Party of the Swiss canton of Geneva may unite with its Communist Party to form a united front.

<p>From Enemies to Friends in Peace and Cooperation</p>
<p>Japanese and German Ambitions Can Cease</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Pravda newspaper published an editorial exclusively on the Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations, stating: (Currently, there are some countries attempting to re-divide the world, and they first plan to sacrifice the Soviet Union to expand themselves, proposing plans for an anti-Soviet war and seeking help from the entire imperialist world. However, an anti-Soviet war will inevitably lead to the outbreak of contradictions among all imperialists and could become the turning point for a global war. Therefore, although some capitalist countries are hostile to the Soviet Union, they ultimately harbor a fear that the anti-Soviet actions of imperialist adventurers could be the prelude to a new world war, a war that would target several imperialist countries. (Since Germany and Japan withdrew from the League, most of the major and minor powers in the League have deemed the policy of leaning towards war as formidable. However, they have failed to restrain Japan's aggressive policies or prevent Germany's expansion of armaments. As the war crisis becomes increasingly serious, they are seeking new forces whose capabilities are sufficient to resist the war crisis. These forces are willing to participate in the creation and safeguarding of peace and can be responsible for this defense work. Although they are hostile to socialism, they cannot help but turn their attention to the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union has proven its steadfastness and decisiveness in its struggle to maintain peace.) Under the current circumstances, the Soviet Union has never refused any form of cooperation in the capitalist world that is concerned with preventing war. Stalin has clearly defined the Soviet Union's attitude towards the League of Nations. This attitude is determined by (1) the attitude of the League of Nations member states towards the Soviet Union, (2) their attitude towards aggressive plans (regardless of where they come from), and (3) the League of Nations' ability to prevent war (as Stalin mentioned). This is absolutely clear. The Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations means that a great power has joined as a powerful force striving for peace and as the greatest force in the international arena. When joining, it deeply wishes to utilize all possibilities to prevent war (even the smallest should be utilized). (TASS News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In order to address the international crisis of 1935 and 1936, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will accurately convey the true situation of Japan's advancement to foreign envoys. At the same time, it will seek smooth contact with the trends of domestic public opinion to avoid delaying opportunities. Therefore, the selection of envoys to be sent abroad is extremely prudent. As a result of discussions at the leadership meeting on the 18th, it was decided to send Mr. Shigeru Yoshida, former Ambassador to Italy, as a representative of the Foreign Minister. The ambassador has agreed. One or two section chief-level officials will be selected from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attendants. They are scheduled to depart from Tokyo in early October. The trip will last approximately four months, passing through Northwest Siberia to the Soviet Union, Poland, Germany, Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom. Then, they will cross from the UK to the United States. All Japanese embassies visited along the way must be inspected, and Japan's appropriate and unwavering ultimate policy must be conveyed in order to break through the international crisis and practically supervise the envoys stationed abroad so that they can follow it.

<p>(New York) The textile workers' strike in the United States has entered its third week today, but the situation is even darker than before. Strike Committee Chairman Gorman has issued a desperate appeal stating that if the strike is not resolved within this week, all non-striking parts of the textile industry will also shut down. If this threat is realized, 100,000 workers in the dyeing industry, rayon industry, underwear industry, knitting industry, and carpet industry will be affected. Several clashes between strikers and the National Guard occurred today, but there were no major casualties. A team of National Guardsmen in Berman was ordered to maintain order at a knitting factory. A thousand picketers shouted at them, "You are creating a revolution!" But the National Guard calmly advanced and pointed their bayonets at them. The picketers quickly retreated. In Water Village, Maine, picketers planned to attack a factory, and bricks flew, shattering many windows. In Newman, Georgia, many picketers were arrested by the National Guard. The Governor of Georgia, in view of the seriousness of the labor unrest, has declared martial law in areas where disturbances are difficult for local officials to handle. A detention center is being prepared for construction in Atlanta, protected by barbed wire, to detain the arrested strikers. Thirty-eight teams of the National Guard have been dispatched in North Carolina, and twenty-four teams have also been dispatched in South Carolina. Two hundred and nine cotton mills have closed in North Carolina, and two hundred and eighty-two are operating. Ninety mills have closed in South Carolina, and ninety-nine are operating.

<p>Liu's Brigade Recovers Chengjiashan</p>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence: The bandits on the border of Wu, Qi, and Fu in Jiangxi and Anhui have recently had their villages of Jiuli and Xingtiand recovered by the 43rd Brigade. Turning away at Qijiakou, they simultaneously advanced to the front lines, separately intercepting the remaining bandits. The main force of the bandits has fallen into heavy encirclement. Except for one group that broke through and fled to Qimen, scattering and collapsing into the city, the rest are still entrenched in the Chengjiashan Yingxi area, stubbornly resisting, making a final struggle. According to reliable information from the Reserve Army Headquarters, on the morning of the 7th of this month, after the 43rd Brigade encircled and defeated bandits near Hanyuan, at 7:00 AM that day, they had already recovered Chengjiashan, the important nest of the bandits. They are now handling the aftermath. In order to facilitate the unified command of the suppression of scattered bandits in the border areas of Wuyuan, Fuliang, Dexing, and Leping, Commander Chen specially appointed Liu Qing, Brigade Commander of the 43rd Brigade, as the commander of the suppression in Wu, Fu, De, and Le, commanding the subordinate troops to be responsible for suppressing the scattered bandits in the border areas and the city defense affairs of Wucheng. The bandits who had previously fled to Qimen were tracked down and defeated by Wang's battalion, retreating to the deep mountains north of Heiqiao on the border of Shinan (Shidai) and Qi, hiding during the day and coming out at night. Li, the commander of bandit suppression on the border of Anhui and Jiangxi, has sent troops to suppress them. The bandit situation in Qimen is no longer as rampant as before. However, the areas most severely affected by the bandits, such as Daohu, are still uninhabited. Refugees who return occasionally find their homes destroyed, their possessions looted, and their livestock perished. Unable to stay, they continue to flee, begging for relief. The situation is extremely tragic. (13th</p>

<p>Over One Hundred Wounded Japanese Soldiers Transported Back to Japan</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Righteous Armies in various parts of the Northeast, during this time of national crisis, are increasingly brave in resisting the enemy and saving the country. The details are as follows: On the 3rd of this month, the 303rd Russian freight train, dispatched from Bogula on the eastern section of the China Eastern Railway, was traveling between Xiaojiu Station and Mifeng Station when the railway was sabotaged in advance by the Righteous Army. When the train arrived at this location, the locomotive and four freight cars were overturned and derailed. The Righteous Army, ambushing on both sides, fired all at once. Many crew members, police, and Japanese railway guard troops were killed or wounded. Rescue trains were dispatched from Harbin and other places to rush to the scene to rescue. However, the rescue train departing from Harbin was delayed, and by the time it arrived, the Righteous Army had safely seized what they could and left. Also, at Henglizi, 12 kilometers south of Pingan Station on the Rabin Line, more than 400 Righteous Army members nicknamed "Delin" suddenly appeared. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese and puppet forces immediately dispatched the Taniguchi unit of the Japanese army from Wuchang County to rush to the battle. On the night of the 5th, the Righteous Army broke through the encirclement. As a result, Japanese soldiers Kondo, Inaba, and Umezaki were killed in battle. In addition, Ito was also seriously injured. Also, at 6:00 AM on the 8th of this month, the railway construction site in the forest area of the Japanese Kondo Forestry Company in Yabulini on the eastern section of the China Eastern Railway was suddenly attacked by about 40 Righteous Army members. Nakamura Heizaburo, the manager of the forest area, was seriously injured. Three people, including the branch chief, the self-defense corps leader, and the telegrapher, were killed. Also, at 7:00 AM on the same day, a large number of Righteous Army members suddenly appeared 40 kilometers away at the junction of Gaoling and Liudaogouzi. The 91st train was also overturned. Also, four long-distance buses departing from Tonghe on the eastern border of Liaoning and heading to Shanchenzhen had just arrived at Erlidi, southeast of Sanjianbao, when they were suddenly attacked by more than 60 Righteous Army members. Twelve Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, with three dead. Matsuno, Inoue, and another Japanese merchant were killed. Nine people were injured (Morimura Jinzo, the governor, and eight others). Two Japanese merchants, Yoshimi, and two Manchurians were captured. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese and puppet forces urgently dispatched teams from Shanchenzhen, Tonghua, and Liuhe to rush to support. After fierce fighting, both sides suffered casualties again.</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence: Recently, after the Righteous Army rose up to resist Japan in northern Manchuria, the Japanese army suffered repeated heavy losses. The number of deaths and injuries is heard of every day. Recently, another 103 wounded soldiers, under the care of 11 nurses including Nursing Officer Yamashita, arrived in Dalian at 6:20 AM on the 7th of this month. Many Japanese officials and civilians came to welcome them. They were admitted to the Ojima-cho Garrison Hospital and are scheduled to return to Japan proper by ship around the 10th. Also, a group of educational inspectors from Ehime Prefecture, Japan, after completing their inspection of the entire Manchuria, were returning south from Harbin when their train was also overturned and attacked by the Righteous Army. Among the 29 members of the group, five died and four were seriously injured. The remaining 20 members arrived in Dalian at 3:00 PM on the 7th, along with the injured, and were comforted by the Japanese Women's Association and other Japanese people in the VIP room of the station, and will soon return home by boat.

<p>(Songjiang) Yuan Quanlin, the owner of the Far East Hotel on Xidajie in this city, raped Shun Di, the 15-year-old adopted daughter of Mrs. Wang Zhou, the owner of the Zhenxin Hotel, on June 28, and stole her jewelry box and fled. Mrs. Wang Zhou filed a lawsuit in court. Yuan, upon hearing the news, disappeared. Although his family searched for him, there was no trace of him. The case was heard in court today. The defendant was absent. The plaintiff, Mrs. Wang Zhou, brought her adopted daughter to court to testify about the rape. She said that Yuan Quanlin took advantage of Wang's absence to sneak into her house and began to harass her adopted daughter, then forcibly raped her. The adopted daughter's screams were heard by the tea boy Wang Zizhai, Zhang Honghai, and the police officer Wu Guanyuan, who was on guard at the Maluqiao station. Officer Wu shined his flashlight on her without error. Gu Changqi, who was cooling off, also heard the screams, which can be used as evidence. After the rape, he threw the soiled pants into the Houhe, and before leaving, he stole a jewelry box and fled. The investigating official instructed that the raped Shun Di be sent to Songjiang Hospital for examination. The defendant's wife also hired lawyers Ni Bingshi and Zheng Wen to write a defense, and also filed a counterclaim, stating that Yuan and Wang Zhou were uncle and aunt. They once lived together, and then suddenly separated and each held evidence. Recently, because Yuan opened the Songhui Hotel, which conflicted with Wang Zhou's Zhenjin Hotel, they began to slander each other. Now that Yuan has fled, she is filing a counterclaim, etc. Both sides hold their own views, and it is unknown how to resolve the case.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Implementing Forced Registration of Smokers <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The County Anti-Smoking Committee has made up its mind to implement smoking bans. Committee Chairman Yan Shenyu stated that the deadline for smoker registration in urban and rural areas is approaching, but many smokers in various districts are still waiting and watching, which violates the government's original intention of banning smoking within a specified time. Yesterday, he specially formulated a simple method of forced registration, scheduled to implement forced registration, and instructed the County Public Security Bureau and the public security sub-bureaus and district public offices to implement it. At the same time, he ordered Wang Ji, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, and the sub-bureau chiefs and patrol officers of the direct subordinate branch offices, to concurrently serve as members of the investigation and seizure group of the County Anti-Smoking Association. The forced registration method is as follows: 1. From September 21st to the 30th in urban areas, and from September 26th to the 30th in rural areas, all unregistered smokers must undergo forced registration. 2. All investigation teams and registration points are responsible for forcing smokers to fulfill the registration requirements. They will be assessed based on whether the investigation of smokers in their respective jurisdictions is thorough, in order to determine rewards and punishments. 3. If any investigation team or registration point finds any smokers who have not yet registered, they shall immediately summon them to the registration point and order them to register, and collect the fee. If they resist the summons, they may change the summons to detention. 4. If an unregistered smoker refuses to register after being summoned to the registration point, they may be escorted to the County Anti-Smoking Association for review. 5. If an unregistered smoker declares that they have quit smoking, they must fill out a separate quit-smoking application form and submit it to the association for record. Otherwise, they must obtain a license and must not attempt to confuse or evade the regulations. 6. When enforcing forced registration of smokers, in addition to the license fee that the smoker should pay, the investigation teams and the enforcing police officers at the registration points must not extort additional fees. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Notorious Bandit Was Identified by the Victim Without Error <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>(Changzhou) The case of the robbery at the home of Zhao Songping, a gentry in Qingguo Lane in Wuyi City, on January 8th of last year, in which the gatekeeper He Canhai was shot and killed, caused a sensation at the time. Recently, one of the main perpetrators of the case, Yu Congchang, was captured, and the original stolen soft satin mandarin jacket and table carpet were recovered. The sub-perpetrators were interrogated repeatedly, but they all denied committing the robbery. They said that after the robbery occurred, they were once captured by the investigation team and handed over to Mr. Zhao for identification. Mr. Zhao was unable to identify them at the time, so why do you now say that I did it? The reason is that this bandit is the brother of Mr. Zhao's coachman, and he once served as a soldier. When he committed the robbery, he spoke with a Haiqiang accent and wore makeup and a beard. At the time of identification, he had a white beard and face, and spoke with a local accent. At that time, Mr. Zhao suspected him but did not dare to identify him. Magistrate Hou urged Mr. Zhao to go to the county to identify him, as the perpetrator firmly refused to confess. Zhao replied to Hou that he would wait until the perpetrator grew his beard in prison before identifying him. The perpetrator has been in prison for many days, and his beard has grown. Magistrate Hou immediately sent Secretary Yang to interrogate him on the afternoon of the 17th, and also notified Mr. Zhao to come to court. The perpetrator was given a press-haired呢帽(woolen hat) by the bailiffs, and wore a green cloth shirt (the clothes he was wearing when he committed the robbery). His beard was also long. When Mr. Zhao arrived in court, he saw that the perpetrator's appearance and dress were exactly the same as when he committed the robbery. He immediately told the court that it was indeed the perpetrator who committed the robbery, and there was no error. After another round of questioning, the perpetrator was ordered to fingerprint and dismissed from court.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Young Man Poses as Western Doctor to Swindle <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>(Jiangyin) Recently, a young man posing as a Western doctor has been going to wealthy families in the city to carry out scams. A few days ago, a young man in Western clothing suddenly came to the home of Mr. Sha in Qingguo Lane, claiming to be the director of a certain hospital in Wuxi and said that he received a quick letter from his home and came to treat his illness. After being entertained by the female servant, he learned that he wasn't home, so his wife came out. At that time, there were several maids watching. The young man pointed to one of the maids and said that she had a disease and would soon be in danger, so he would treat her free of charge. He took out a silver needle, poked it into her back, then used a magnetic cup, baked it with a match, closed the silver needle, and took it out after a while. As expected, there was a cup of phlegm. The wife believed that he was a famous doctor, because after passing through the door, she often grieved about having no children, so she was eager to have a son and asked the young man to treat her. The young man also used the previous method to extract three cups of cold phlegm first, and then said that prescribing and decocting medicine would be troublesome, so he would give the family nine pills specially made by the Zhang mansion in Wuxi, each pill costing seven yuan. Sha's wife agreed and immediately paid 63 yuan. The young man got the money and made an excuse that he had to go to another family to treat their illness and went back to Wuxi, and then went out without knowing where he went. When he returned home, he learned that he had been scammed, and said that the phlegm in the cup was a chemical reaction. The Medical Association learned about this and, believing that it damaged the reputation of Western medicine, sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau urging them to arrest him to prevent people from being deceived.</p>

<p>(Nantong) The cotton fields in various counties under Nantong and the coastal reclamation areas of Huainan are now in the peak season for cotton picking, but the continuous autumn rain has caused many of the cotton bolls to rot due to rain immersion. The area suffered from drought at the beginning of this year, followed by autumn overcast weather. The losses to cotton farmers are extremely severe. It is estimated that the value of cotton production in the Jianghua area this year is about 56 million yuan, of which 9 million yuan belongs to the reclamation area.</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) Sun Lichao, a bandit in Fenghua, Sheng County, Xin Chang and Fenghua and Ninghai counties, whose nickname is Sun Laoer, from Sunjiatian, Xinchang County. His brother, Libiao, was also a bandit. He was captured by the Provincial Government in Shanghai in the 20th year of the Republic of China. He died by suicide by taking poison on the way to Hangzhou. Libiao's subordinates were scattered in the four counties, and then elected Lichao as their leader. The police force gradually increased. Recently, he regretted being a bandit and surrendered to the Standing Army of the county. The captain of the team telegraphed the Second Security Branch for instructions. He was instructed to escort Sun to discuss surrender matters.</p>

<p>Shen Changfa, a native of Shaoxing, who was originally a weaver, lived on Dadongmen Straight Street in Xiashao. In recent years, due to the failure of the silk industry, he switched to selling small commodities for a living. He also lost all his capital. He then made a living by pulling a rickshaw, using his income to support his family. Recently, his old mother was critically ill. The family had pawned everything and owed a lot of rent, so they could not afford medical treatment. Shen developed a world-weary mentality, went to Huanglong Cave in West Lake and hanged himself. He was later discovered and resuscitated with artificial respiration and sent to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>(Jiaxing) The Jiaxing County Farmers Bank previously experienced a major theft, losing over 40,000 yuan in cash and banknotes. A package of gold jewelry was also deposited by a Mr. Tu. Subsequently, a special investigator from the provincial government was dispatched to Jiaxing to investigate the bank. Discrepancies in the accounts' income and expenditure were discovered. The bank's chief cashier, Xu Fukang, and related staff member, Tu Yiran, were immediately investigated. Manager Wu Heshu, fearing punishment, fled. The county government then transferred the two bank employees, Xu and Tu, along with laborers Tu Haigen, Song Shiyuan, and suspects Zhi Asi, Feng Xingsun, Chen Afa, and others, a total of nine people, to the court for interrogation. After the investigation was concluded, they were collectively prosecuted for embezzlement. Judge Zhou Wending of the criminal court opened the trial on the morning of the 18th. Xu and Tu hired lawyer Jiang Weixian to defend them. After a detailed interrogation regarding the falsification of accounts and the circumstances of the theft, bank personnel claimed that the forgery of accounts was instructed by the manager, and they had no knowledge of the theft. Chen Afa and others claimed they had no involvement whatsoever. The court ordered Tu Yiran, Xu Fukang, Song Shiyuan, and Tu Haigen to each provide a cash bail of 1,000 yuan. Chen Afa and the other seven were ordered to each provide a written bail of 1,000 yuan. Tu and others requested to change to written bail in court, which was denied. Since they had no cash, they were immediately returned to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e110">All Sectors Hold Commemoration Rally <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Citywide Suspension of Entertainment and Half-Mast Flag in Mourning</p>
<p>Over Three Thousand Members of Youth Propaganda Corps</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan Reports on Road and Maritime Party Department Conference</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday was the third anniversary of the September 18th National Humiliation Incident. All government agencies, organizations, and schools in the city flew flags at half-mast to express mourning. At 11:00 AM, all citizens stopped working for five minutes, stood up to commemorate and vow to avenge the national humiliation, and expressed condolences to the fallen soldiers and martyred compatriots who resisted Japan. All amusement venues in the city were closed. Restaurants and taverns also suspended banquets. The military and police authorities, fearing that reactionary elements might take the opportunity to cause trouble, took extra precautions. The city's Party headquarters also convened a commemoration rally at the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Corps at 10:00 AM, gathering representatives from all sectors. Representatives from all sectors gave mournful speeches. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Venue Decoration) A bamboo cloth banner was hung above the entrance of the assembly, reading "Shanghai All Sectors Representatives September 18th Third Anniversary Commemoration Rally." The venue was plastered with various stimulating slogans. Ten slogans were hung on the stage, along with a portrait of the late Founding Father and the Party and national flag. The Municipal Public Security Bureau military band also participated in playing mournful music. Tao Baichuan, Mayor Wu (represented by Chen Kecheng), Jiang Huaisu, Zhu Xuefan, Yu Zhenhui, and Yu Zuoting, all members of the Presidium, arrived on time. The atmosphere at the venue was solemn.</p>
<p>(Rally Order) (1) Music, (2) Sing the Party Anthem, (3) Pay the Highest Respects to the Party and National Flag and the Late Founding Father's Portrait, (4) The Chairman Respectfully Reads the Late Founding Father's Last Will, (5) Observe Three Minutes of Silence to Mourn the Compatriots Who Died in the Northeast, (6) Report, (7) Speeches.</p>

(Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</p>
<p>(Chairman's Report) After the formalities were completed, Tao Baichuan, as the Chairman of the meeting, gave a report, stating: "Three years have passed since the September 18th Incident. During these three years, over four million square miles of our Northeast territory have continued to be occupied by the violent Japanese, and over thirty million people have continued to be trampled upon by the violent Japanese. Tracing back to the violent Japanese invasion of Ryukyu and then the invasion of the Northeast, and now eyeing North China, they have become the greatest enemy of our Chinese nation. Their ambition is to rule our entire China. Therefore, if our nation wants to survive, we must overthrow Japanese imperialism in order to avenge this extraordinary humiliation. When we are unwilling to submit temporarily, we should unite as one, strengthen our national power, consolidate our national defense, and especially pay attention to the following four things: First, strengthen military equipment. In terms of the air force, we should have two to three thousand airplanes. In terms of the navy, we should prepare for hundreds of thousands of tons of naval vessels. In terms of the army, the entire nation should be able to go to the battlefield and fight the enemy with their lives. Second, strive for political integrity and make all officials in the country serve the country with a spirit of sacrifice. As Yue Wumu said, (Scholars do not love money, and soldiers are not afraid of death). Only in this way can we reverse this crisis. In particular, the central government should have sufficient power to command the entire country, and all local governments should obey the central government. Then China can achieve true unity, and the national situation can turn from danger to safety and from weakness to strength. Third, promote economic construction, such as all transportation tools and industries, which should be actively promoted so that huge amounts of leakage are no longer lost overseas every year. Fourth, reform education. Education is the foundation of a nation. Our revenge cannot be effective in one day or one night. Therefore, we should use education to cultivate healthy citizens. Then, even if we cannot immediately avenge this great hatred, our children and grandchildren will be able to continue this ambition and avenge this extraordinary humiliation." Finally, regarding the treatment of symptoms, we must achieve national unity politically, and socially, all people should earnestly boycott Japanese goods and resist for a long time. We should never forget the matter of revenge, and then victory can be predicted. Then, Mayor Wu representing Chen Kecheng, Zhu Xuefan, and Jiang Huaisu delivered speeches. The speeches were lengthy, so the details are omitted.</p>
<p>(Rally Slogans) (1) Compatriots Across the Country Unite, (2) Strengthen National Power and Consolidate National Defense, (3) Overthrow Japanese Imperialism, (4) Recover the Lost Territory of the Northeast, (5) Assist the Northeast Volunteer Army, (6) Rescue the Suffering Compatriots in the Northeast, (7) Expand the Self-Defense Movement, (8) Vigorously Promote National Goods, (9) Long Live the Chinese Nationalist Party, Long Live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(Banners Hanging Everywhere) In order to deeply impress the public about the September 18th Incident, the Municipal Party Headquarters specially hung bamboo cloth banners in various thoroughfares: (1) Swear to Avenge National Humiliation, (2) Expand the Self-Defense Movement, (3) Rescue the Northeastern Compatriots Who Are Under the Iron Hooves of the Enemy, (4) September 18th is the National Humiliation Day When the Violent Japanese Occupied Our Northeast, (5) Compatriots Across the Country Unite to Resist the Violent Japanese, (6) Recover the Lost Territory of the Northeast.</p>
<p>(Citywide Alert) The military and police authorities stationed armed soldiers and police at key transportation points in South Shanghai and Zhabei, and security was very tight. At the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Corps, the police station in charge also sent a large number of armed police officers and security teams to maintain order. The military police were withdrawn around 12:00 noon. The concession also sent extra patrols to take extra precautions.</p>
<p>(Two Railroad Party Headquarters) The Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways held a commemoration rally for the third anniversary of the National Humiliation in the assembly hall of the headquarters yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Those who signed in included all members of the headquarters committee, colleagues, labor unions of the two railways, all staff members of the Party Headquarters of the First District, and representatives from the Railway Bureau Fan Shouzhi, Hu Jichuang, and representatives from various Fulin Elementary Schools, Vocational Schools, and Workers' Children's Schools, totaling over a hundred people. Chairman Chen Chengshi presided over the meeting, and the master of ceremonies, Wang Cheng, led the ceremony. Chairman Chen then gave a report, stating: "The unprecedented September 18th National Humiliation has been three years ago today. Although we are pained by the memory of the past tragedies, we must face the current situation. The fall of Shenyang is enough to make people feel grief and indignation. In fact, the cannon fire in front of the Beidaying barracks was only the first sound of the violent Japanese's policy of aggression. As long as we look back at the facts of the past three years, in the Sino-Japanese relations, the violent Japanese's iron fist of aggression has extended into the mainland. When and where is it not advancing inch by inch? When we hold the commemoration rally for the third anniversary of the National Humiliation today, we should target the facts, sever internal strife, eliminate the Red bandits, strengthen national defense, and continue to boycott Japanese goods. We do not care about the form of mere mourning, but in the invigoration of the spirit of resistance and the cultivation of resistance capabilities. Whether the four northeastern provinces are still the territory of the Republic of China depends not on whether the violent Japanese let go, but on whether we have the power to recover them. Today, we have nothing to worry about, and we cannot hesitate any longer. We hope that everyone will deeply realize that their seven-foot-tall body can always do their best in their work of saving the country." Then, representatives of the Railway Bureau Fan Shouzhi, and Party Headquarters Chen Pin and Xie Chengyu successively gave speeches, with many warnings. Afterwards, slogans were shouted and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>(Seafarers' Party Headquarters) The Special Party Headquarters of the Chinese Seafarers held a commemoration rally for the September 18th Incident at the assembly hall of the Party Headquarters yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. All committee members, staff members, personnel from the Shanghai District Party Headquarters and district branches, representatives from the China Ship Wireless Telegraphers Public Welfare Association, the Middle Cabin Guild, the Nanjun Anlian Charity Association, and other organizations, totaling over two hundred people, all participated. After the formalities were completed, Chairman Chen Su reported, dividing his report into seven points: (1) The fact that Japan attacked Shenyang and occupied our four eastern provinces, (2) The puppet farce played by Japan and the continuous struggle of our Northeast Volunteer Army, (3) Japan's consistent policy of invading China and its diplomatic steps, (4) Japan is also actively sucking up our city market economy, (5) Only by invigorating the national spirit can we avenge and wipe out humiliation, (6) Only by expanding national defense strength can we save the country and survive, (7) As long as we do not forget the pain of September 18th, we will not lack the opportunity to recover lost territory. At the same time, slogans were shouted and the September 18th Memorial Announcement to Seafarers was distributed.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Reflections of Gu Weijun and Wang Zhengting on China's Failure to Be Elected as a Non-Permanent Member of the League of Nations Council <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately Not Elected This Year, Can Still Compete Next Year</p>
<p>Citizens Should Focus on Internal Affairs, Then There Will Be Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, China's request to obtain the right to be re-elected as a non-permanent member of the Council of the League of Nations was rejected by the League of Nations General Assembly on the 17th, and Turkey succeeded as a non-permanent member. China's failure to be elected this time will lead to a lack of good contributions to the League of Nations on the Far East issue, which is of great importance to the future of the League of Nations. The Central News Agency reporter immediately inquired about China's failure to be elected with Gu Weijun, China's Minister to France, and Wang Zhengting, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, who are now in Shanghai. Their talks were as follows:</p>
<p>(China Can Compete Again Next Year) According to Gu, there are five permanent members of the Council of the League of Nations and nine non-permanent members. Last year, one seat was added, totaling ten seats, for a total of fifteen seats. Those elected are all from countries in Europe and the Americas. In the first session of the League of Nations Council, no representative from an Asian country was elected. At that time, I was appointed to attend the General Assembly, so I suggested two principles to the General Assembly: (1) Non-permanent members should pay attention to regional distribution, (2) Countries that have not been elected as permanent or non-permanent members should be elected in rotation. This was well received by various countries, so at the 1920 General Assembly, based on this principle, China obtained the votes of the majority of member states and was elected as a non-permanent member representing Asian countries. This time, when the term expired and the election was held, China's request for re-election failed to obtain the two-thirds majority of the General Assembly, resulting in rejection, and the General Assembly elected Turkey to succeed. But next year, China can still participate in the election again. As for the number of seats for representatives of Asian countries as non-permanent members, it does not seem necessary to increase them, because in previous General Assemblies, those who proposed to increase the number of seats for non-permanent members were severely attacked by the representatives of the majority of member states, because there are not many Asian countries, and there is no need to increase the number of seats.</p>
<p>(League of Nations Lacking) Minister Gu believes that China's request for re-election as a non-permanent member was rejected by the General Assembly, which is a great pity, not only for China, but also for the League of Nations itself, because China is a country that loves peace and supports the League of Nations most strongly, and it is indeed necessary for it to be re-elected. In other words, if China is re-elected, it will also benefit the League of Nations itself. Gu also said that China is a country that has been invaded by force, and the fact that it has been invaded by force has been proven by the League of Nations and has a resolution. For the sake of respecting the League of Nations Covenant, China's request for re-election was denied, which is a great regret. At this time of tension in the Far East situation, special attention should be paid to peace in the international community. Now that China cannot be re-elected, the League of Nations will inevitably lack a considerable contribution to the Far East issue, which is a pity for the future of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(Turkey Has Been Planning to Compete for a Long Time) As for why China failed to be elected this time, it is because Turkey joined the League of Nations not long ago. After the European War, Turkey worked hard to revitalize and became a new country. It is very active in international activities, such as sending ambassadors to various countries. Turkey is located between Europe and Asia, so it is called a European country in Europe and an Asian country in Asia. This time, it actually won a seat as a non-permanent member in the name of an Asian country. Turkey's plan to win this seat is not a matter of a day or two. Last year, it tried to take on the positions of Chairman of the Council of the League of Nations and non-permanent members, but all failed. This time, it came back with great ambition. Turkey's foreign policy has always been in the same direction as France, Russia, and the Little Entente. Persia also participated in the non-permanent member election before, but then announced that it would give way to Turkey. From this, we can see the strength of Turkey's activities in the international community. Since Turkey is a newly joined member of the League of Nations and has not been elected to any position in the League of Nations, it is no coincidence that it achieved better results in this election.</p>
<p>(Soviet Union's Joining the League Has Nothing to Do With Us) As for the Soviet Union's imminent joining of the League of Nations, while China happened to fail in the election at this time, Minister Gu believes that there is no direct relationship.</p>
<p>(Never Forget Recovering Lost Territory) Yesterday was the September 18th Memorial Day. When Minister Gu met with reporters, he also expressed his feelings, saying: "I have many feelings on this September 18th Memorial Day. The Northeast has been occupied for three years, and although the lost territory has not yet been recovered, the people and the government have never forgotten their determination to recover the lost territory. What I hope for from my compatriots is that at this time when foreign aggression is imminent, we should unite as one and focus on the four words of recovering the lost territory, remember them in our hearts, endure hardship and humiliation, and swear to avenge this humiliation, and then the recovery of the lost territory can be expected in the near future."</p>
<p>(Reasons for Failure: Lack of Contact) According to the written answers of former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting to reporters: (Question) What are your thoughts on the failure to be elected as a permanent member of the League of Nations? (Answer) We should strive to become stronger. (Question) Will the failure to be elected affect the current political situation in the Far East, and will China be in an unfavorable position? (Answer) Not necessarily. (Question) What is the background and significance of the League of Nations not passing China's re-election? (Answer) Probably due to lack of contact with various countries in peacetime. (Question) Is there a close relationship with the issue of the Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations this time? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Should China seek countermeasures or remain silent? (Answer) Of course, remain silent. It should not be regarded as a major event. When powerful countries such as Germany and Russia join, they can obtain the qualifications of permanent members. I hope the people will pay attention to internal affairs. Only with internal affairs can there be foreign affairs, which is what Guan Zhong meant by "If internal affairs are not cultivated, external affairs will not be successful."</p>

<p>Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi Asks the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Instructions</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, recently, our country's overseas Chinese in Japan have been unreasonably expelled by the Japanese authorities. In addition to instructing our country's ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, to lodge a verbal protest with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also lodged a formal protest with the Japanese side on the 14th. This protest letter has been handed over to the Japanese Consulate General in Beijing for transmission to Ambassador Ariyoshi. As of last night, the Japanese Embassy still stated that this protest letter has not yet been delivered to Shanghai. However, according to reliable sources in diplomatic circles, Ambassador Ariyoshi has received this protest and is currently asking the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions on how to respond.</p>

<p>Related to Taiwanese Residents Causing Trouble in Fujian</p>
<p>Since the Fujian authorities ordered a strict ban on Taiwanese residents opening lottery shops and gambling venues in Fuzhou, which induced people to gamble, and successively arrested gambling criminals, Taiwanese ruffians harbored deep resentment and joined the Taiwan Volunteer Corps to throw bombs and fire pistols everywhere in Fuzhou. On the night of the 10th of this month, many Fujian provincial constables were injured by the bombs, and many people were also victimized. They are still searching for culprits.</p>
<p>(Japanese Police Go to Fujian) The Fujian authorities handed over the Taiwanese ruffians who caused trouble to the Japanese Consulate police, and negotiated with the Japanese side on the one hand, and took strict precautions themselves on the other hand. The Japanese Consul stationed in Fuzhou has telegraphed the Shanghai Japanese Consulate to send armed Japanese police to Fujian. The Japanese Consulate has already transferred Inspector-General Yonezawa, leading nine armed Japanese police officers, including Inspector Matsushita, from Shanghai to Fuzhou on the Japanese ship Changsha Maru.</p>
<p>(Warships Head to Fujian) The 26th Destroyer Squadron under the 3rd Fleet of the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai, consisting of the ships "Yume," "Kuri," and "Ume," led by the Commander of the 3rd Fleet, Imamura, left Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the flagship "Izumo" and hurried to Fuzhou. On the surface, they are still using the pretext of protecting Japanese residents.</p>

<p>To Purchase Autumn Cocoons to Assist Farmers</p>
<p>Borrowed from China and Jiangsu's Four Agricultural Banks</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, in order to purchase autumn cocoons and assist farmers, the Jiangsu Provincial Government borrowed 200,000 yuan from four banks, including the Bank of China, using the purchased autumn cocoons as collateral. The loan contract will be signed soon. According to details obtained by the Xinsheng News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>(Borrow Money to Purchase Cocoons) After the sharp decline in exports of our country's silk industry, all silk factories were unable to maintain and ceased operations. This year's sharp decline in silk prices is unprecedented. Silk merchants regard the purchase of cocoons as a daunting task. Therefore, this year's autumn cocoons have few consultants. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has borrowed money to collect and reel silk itself. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, considering that the autumn cocoons in Jintan, Liyang, and other places are about to be on the market, but no one is buying them, decided to borrow money from four banks, including China, Jiaotong, Jiangsu, and Farmers, to assist the rural areas, under the direction of Director of Construction Department Shen Baixian.</p>
<p>(Agreed Amount) After Director Shen had initial contact with the town branches of the four banks, including the Bank of China, he came to Shanghai again for consultation. The amount was 200,000 yuan, with all the purchased autumn cocoons as collateral. After the autumn cocoons are sold, the loan will be repaid continuously. The interest rate and contract are still under negotiation. The banks have expressed their agreement that this loan is to assist farmers, so there will be no other problems. Once the contract is negotiated, it can be signed.</p>

<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, who came to Shanghai to negotiate the Zhejiang Province autumn cocoon loan, has finalized and signed the loan contract yesterday and returned to Hangzhou last night. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Another Meeting Yesterday) Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, accompanied by Secretary Wang Guohua, invited representatives from 14 banks of the (Zhejiang Silk Cocoon Loan Syndicate) to discuss the contract and allocation of the loan amount again at the Bank Association Hall at 59 Hong Kong Road. Those who attended included Ye Fuxiao of the Dalu Bank, Zou Bingwen of the Shanghai Bank, Chen Zheqing of the Yanye Bank, Shou Jingwei of the Bank of China, Zhang Peishen of the Jiaotong Bank, Ye Zhuotang of the Siming Bank, Zhu Miaosheng of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Chen Duoru of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and more than ten others. In addition to making textual revisions to the loan contract, which were not important, the allocation of the loan amount undertaken by each bank was also revised.</p>
<p>(Loan Amount Undertaken by Each Bank) The loan amount revised in yesterday's meeting totaled 3 million yuan: Bank of China 750,000 yuan, Jiaotong Bank 500,000 yuan (50,000 yuan more than initially agreed), Zhejiang Industrial Bank 400,000 yuan, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank 250,000 yuan (50,000 yuan less than before), China Industrial Bank 150,000 yuan, Siming Bank 150,000 yuan (50,000 yuan more than before), Zhongnan Bank 100,000 yuan (50,000 yuan less than before), and Jincheng, Dalu, Yanye, Zhejiang Industrial, China National Goods, China General Commercial, China Reclamation, and other seven banks each 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(Four Copies of the Contract Prepared) After the amount was determined and the text was revised, four identical copies of the official contract were transcribed, with one copy stored in the Zhejiang Provincial Government, one in the Zhejiang Construction Department, one in the Zhejiang Finance Department, and one in the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China, the representative of the banking group, to show good faith.</p>
<p>(Copies Sent to Each Bank for Signature) After the four identical copies of the contract were transcribed, personnel were immediately dispatched to the fourteen banks to have the general manager sign them. However, due to time constraints, only China, Jiaotong, Zhejiang Industrial, Shanghai Commercial, Zhongnan, Jincheng, Yanye, Dalu, China National Goods, Zhejiang Industrial, China General Commercial, and China Reclamation signed yesterday. The remaining China Industrial and Siming banks will supplement their signatures this morning.</p>
<p>(Zeng Returned to Hangzhou Last Night) Zeng Yangfu believed that the loan issue had been completely handled, so he took the Shanghai-Zhapu express train back to Hangzhou yesterday at 6:50 PM, accompanied by Shou Jingwei, a representative of the Bank of China in Hangzhou. As for the China Industrial Bank and Siming Bank, which had not yet signed, Wang Guohua, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, stayed in Shanghai to handle them. After signing with the two banks this morning, he will take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train back to the province to report back.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Yang Can San Discusses Negotiations in England <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to rumors, mineral mortgage loans are completely fictitious.</p>
<p>It is said that they will apply for verification in accordance with Chinese law.</p>
<p>According to the Guo Wen News Agency, Yang Can San, the general manager of Juxingcheng Bank, has attracted attacks from academic circles and attention from society for his investment negotiations in England. A reporter learned of his return to China and went to the bank yesterday to inquire about the truth and his opinions on the matter. The following is a record of the conversation. According to Mr. Yang, this trip abroad to investigate industries was to fulfill a long-cherished wish from ten years ago. It was purely a personal act and had nothing to do with the Sichuan government. The rumor that he was sent by Liu Xiang is absolutely untrue. Liu Xiang has a telegram that can prove this. This should be stated in advance. Currently, there are approximately three major points of attack: (1) Some say that England has long harbored conspiracies in Tibet, and if they invest in Sichuan, it is inevitable that they will have aggressive ambitions. I have also considered this kind of concern, so the first article of the contract clearly stipulates that registration and establishment must be in accordance with Chinese law, in order to prevent it with the power of national law. Moreover, in the past, the contract was made between the government and a foreign country or consortium. The government's position was sufficient to represent the country and the local area, and a slight carelessness could easily lead to invasion. If a private individual in our country engages in commercial activities with a private individual in another country under our country's law, the nature belongs to the scope of civil law and does not affect national sovereignty at all. Therefore, they have no possibility of aggression. Their investment in us, in addition to verifying legitimate uses, does not require any collateral. If the business fails, there are no movable or immovable properties to exercise their right of disposal. Legally speaking, there is really nothing to worry about. Furthermore, based on factual investigations, that country is experiencing economic recession and surplus capital. Deposit interest rates are extremely low, and placement is very difficult. Generally, businessmen are seeking their own ways out to avoid personal economic losses. Their motive is purely to put their own capital in a profitable place and has no political implications. The situations now and in the past are different, and it seems unnecessary to confuse them with overly sensitive nerves. (2) Some say that this approach conflicts with the government's economic control. They do not know that the nature of the government's economic control is active, enabling the people to seek production and construction under the control of the law, rather than preventing the people from doing anything. The financial company is completely subject to Chinese law and does not conflict with the government's control principles. If the government sometimes considers it an obstacle, it can also revise the law at any time to remedy it. In general, the spirit of control should be to ensure that business progresses, production increases, and that control is not lost. (3) Some say that this behavior is to steal all of Sichuan's mineral resources and lose national sovereignty. They do not know that this contract is intended to form a financial company of an introductory nature, preparing for Sichuan's future entrustment of industrial operators to introduce funds. The investment method stipulated is only to indicate that this is the only way to handle it. It is not a loan, so how can there be a mortgage? Even if it is an investment, it is credit. Moreover, it is a private act, and without the government's entrustment, how can it involve all of Sichuan's mineral resources? Anyone with common sense should be able to judge this kind of slander and does not need further explanation. Thinking deeply about saving the country now, empty words are of no help. Production and construction should be the top priority. Sichuan Province has suffered from wars and red disasters. The land of abundance has been impoverished. If we do not follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and make use of foreign capital to vigorously develop construction, it will not be successful. However, foreign capital is not without its drawbacks. After repeated consideration and discussion with friends, we believe that the following five principles should be prepared: (1) Respect national laws and do not harm national sovereignty; (2) Indirect investment, not direct joint ventures; (3) No collateral; (4) Freedom to borrow and repay loans; (5) No monopoly. Based on the above principles, the financial company formed this time is required to register and establish in accordance with Chinese law (Article 1 of the contract). In the future, the industries to be operated should send exploration teams to investigate, and when foreign capital is needed for development, the permission of the government authorities and the public should be obtained (Article 8 of the contract). The board of directors of the financial company will consist of three Chinese directors, with one as chairman, and two Western directors (Article 5 of the contract). In the event of disputes over the terms, Chinese will prevail (Article 24 of the contract). Furthermore, at any time, if it is discovered that it conflicts with China's national interests, it can be proposed to amend it (Supplementary Article 1). Various provisions emphasize national sovereignty, which is in line with the first principle. The industries that Sichuan intends to operate, that is, the hypothetical cooperative company, will collect considerable funds themselves. The financial company will review the project and, if it is appropriate, agree to provide the funds. Capitalists can only hand over the funds to the financial company and do not directly borrow or invest in the industrial group, adopting indirect principles to avoid interference (Article 3 of the contract). This is in line with the second principle. The industries operated by the cooperative company, in addition to being investigated and researched by the financial company, which is responsible for providing loans and sending accountants to supervise the accounts, do not have any collateral (Article 8 of the contract). This is in line with the third principle. The financial company has no right to interfere with whether or not Sichuan industrial groups use foreign capital. When both parties agree and entrust the company to raise funds on their behalf, Chinese people can invest as much as possible, or when the business is established and benefits are seen, domestic people believe it is safe and are willing to invest. After a considerable period of time, funds can be raised to repay all foreign capital and completely break away from the financial company. This can be said to be a temporary use with clear objectives for both advancing and retreating (Article 15 of the contract), which is in line with the fourth principle. For any business, the most taboo after a country invests is to exclude other countries and have a monopoly. This contract does not limit the funds provided by the company to British nationals. People of any nationality can join (Article 3 of the contract). In addition, the principle is to employ Chinese people and purchase Chinese products. If materials must be borrowed from other places, it is not limited to any nationality (Articles 20 and 21 of the contract). This is in line with the fifth principle. I am not wise or capable enough, and my worries may not be all-encompassing, but I am confident that I have not dared to slack off in the slightest in respecting national sovereignty and building and saving the country. Soon, I will submit the contract in gold to the government for verification. If there are any inappropriate parts, I will respectfully comply with any instructions. I will also sincerely accept any criticisms from all sectors for detailed research on the articles. If it is beneficial to the country, I will not be afraid to seek details and will have no prejudice. If I am slandered with empty and unfounded political arguments, then I dare not listen to them. The reporter asked Mr. Yang when he would return to Sichuan. He replied that since Governor Liu resigned from Sichuan, a financial panic has been triggered in Chongqing. I have repeatedly received telegrams from Chongqing urging me to return to Sichuan in the next few days.</p>

<p>(England Needs Shark Skin) According to the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau yesterday, shark skin can be used for food, rubbing objects, making shark leather spectacle cases, sword sheaths, etc., and is widely used. Recently, we received a letter from the British Commercial Office requesting shark skin 30 inches long. Merchants who have these goods can write to the bureau for introduction.</p>
<p>(Germany Needs Frozen Egg White) Eggs are a special product of our country, and the number of their finished products exported to Europe and the United States every year is very large, especially egg white, which is especially good because it is more widely used. In addition to being used for foods such as sweets and biscuits, it is also an indispensable item in refining oils, dyeing work, finishing tanned leather, manufacturing photographs, and in medicine. Now, the German Sika Company has sent a letter stating that it intends to purchase a large quantity of frozen egg white. We hope that manufacturers will contact the company.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association's Telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province Issues Public Bonds</p>
<p>Please Name It Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association sent a telegram saying: "Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Zhejiang is suffering from severe drought. From the plum rain season to the beginning of autumn, there has been no rain for a hundred days. Rivers have dried up, and fields have cracked. Late rice has not been planted, and seedlings have withered. Potatoes, yams, melons, and beans have also been scorched to death. Rice prices have soared, more than doubling the normal price. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in a century. Since the 12th year of the Republic, Zhejiang Province has suffered from repeated disasters, including floods. There has been almost no year without a disaster, and no disaster that has not been severe. The granaries have long been depleted. Now, we are suffering from an unprecedented drought, just like a long-term illness or serious injury, with pain and scars being created again. Recently, incidents of robbing rice and families starving to death have been repeatedly reported. Hunger-stricken people from Ningyan Binhai Huangwan Baolang and other places are forming groups to sell surplus salt in exchange for a few liters of rice, resulting in the tragic incident of tax police shooting and killing many people. The salt people, in order to eke out a living, do not care about being severely punished. Carrying loads on their shoulders, they still continue to travel the roads. Tragedies may not be difficult to see again. In addition, hooligans are inciting people in desolate areas. The future is uncertain, and hidden worries are growing. Fellow Zhejiang natives in Shanghai, in view of the seriousness of the disaster, have repeatedly gathered to discuss the establishment of the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, hoping to do their best to help their fellow citizens. We have heard that Zhejiang Province is issuing 20 million in public bonds, and representatives such as Chen Qinshi, Yu Qiaqing, and Wang Xiaolai have been elected to petition the provincial government to use these public bonds for emergency relief, namely, to organize work relief and restore water conservancy throughout the province, but we have not received a clear answer. At a time when the people are impoverished and have no surplus funds, they can no longer bear this huge burden. If it is used for disaster prevention and relief, as a temporary expedient, although it is a policy of drinking poison to quench thirst, at a time when both public and private resources are exhausted, the people should understand the government's unavoidable distress of accumulating debts and sympathize with them. If it is used to make up for the shortage of government expenses and to carry out unnecessary construction projects to beautify politics and disregard the people's hardships, the people of Zhejiang, even if they are weak, will swear to do their best to oppose it. This public bond is currently under review by the Ministry of Finance. We respectfully ask you to take care of your hometown and to preside over the matter. Please send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance to amend the public bond regulations, naming it a disaster relief public bond and ensuring that it is used for relief and water conservancy construction, so that the remaining disaster victims can receive practical benefits. We urgently submit this petition and hope that you will take note of it. Furthermore, our association was just established on a cold day and has not yet elected standing committee members and chairmen. We hereby state this together. All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, K., Qiao. (The telegram to the Ministry of Finance is omitted)."</p>
<h3 id="e120">The City Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs the Ministry of Communications to Order the Shanghai Post Office to Use Domestic Coal <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Recovering the Leakage of More Than 20,000 Yuan in Diesel Fuel Every Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing yesterday, saying: "We received a letter from the Coal Industry Association on the 17th of this month, stating: 'According to a letter from our member, Shanxi Coal Industry Company, the International Trade Bureau has repeatedly announced that the trade deficit index is gradually increasing. All Chinese people are heartbroken and are planning ways to promote domestic products. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. We believe that the self-built building of the Shanghai Postal Administration has heating equipment. When the building was completed, coal was used as fuel for more than two years. Later, the original intention was suddenly changed, and imported diesel fuel was used instead. The annual consumption reached more than 30,000 yuan. This trivial matter may not have been noticed by the authorities of the Ministry of Communications, but if small leaks are not stopped, they will become rivers and seas. A single spark can start a prairie fire. It is estimated that there are no less than 200 tall buildings in Shanghai, and 99% of them use coal. Even those that previously used diesel fuel have now switched to coal, such as the Jianghai Customs Building, the British HSBC Bank, and other bank apartments. The fact that they have switched from diesel fuel to coal proves that domestic coal is superior to diesel fuel in terms of both efficiency and economy. Now, the people of the country are loudly calling for the use of domestic products, but government agencies are instead monopolized by foreigners and do not promote them. However, sovereignty ultimately belongs to our government, so we deeply hope that our government agencies can promote them first, setting an example so that the people will follow and obey, thereby strengthening the country's power. Moreover, domestic coal is now abundant in the market and is sold at low prices. The bureau can take this opportunity to use domestic coal in order to recover its rights and interests. Our company, having learned of the previous situation, cannot remain silent. We know that your association is a group of our coal industry and is enthusiastic about promoting domestic coal, so we dare to request that you forward a letter to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce to submit to the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Industry for review and verification. Please issue separate orders to the Shanghai Postal Administration to comply with the above and improve the promotion of domestic coal. The national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit greatly.' According to this, we have found that domestic coal is currently in a competitive relationship with foreign coal, so the market price is very low. If we can abandon diesel fuel and switch to domestic coal, we can save a lot of money. We can both promote domestic products and plug the leak. It is truly killing two birds with one stone. Accordingly, we request that your association approve the forwarding of this letter to the two ministries of communications and industry, and quickly issue separate orders to the Shanghai Postal Administration to switch to domestic coal in order to show its promotion and maintain domestic coal. This will be a public service." "We have found that the Postal Administration is a state agency and has the responsibility to promote domestic products. Diesel fuel is currently used and is purely foreign goods. Our country does not yet have a domestically produced substitute. Heating equipment has domestic coal available, and the bureau should not switch to diesel fuel, which would promote the sales of imported goods. The sales of this item are said to reach more than 30,000 yuan a year, which is not a very large amount, but it is related to international perception and public opinion. If it is not corrected, then the so-called 'the wind blows over the grass, and the grass bends,' and 'the law is implemented from above' will all be in vain. How can we reverse the corruption of morals and customs? It is reasonable to telegraph your ministry for review and verification, and to order the Shanghai Bureau to correct this, as a public service. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, K., Xiao."</p>

<p>Shiye News Agency reported that the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: "Recently, we approved a telegram from the Jinhua County Chamber of Commerce in Zhejiang, which stated: 'Recently, we read the Ministry of Finance's announcement in the Shen Bao on September 12, stating that from November 1 of this year, the revenue stamps issued by the Ministry will be implemented, and all old revenue stamps may no longer be affixed. Violators will be punished according to the regulations for underpayment of taxes. The old revenue stamps stored by various shops in our county are very large in number. They are all accumulated each month and are not shops that have contracted for a fixed amount of sales. Now, there is only a little over a month before the issuance of new stamps. How can we sell such a large number? Therefore, we appeal to your association to request the Ministry of Finance to allow the exchange of old stamps for new ones, and to send a letter to the Zhejiang Revenue Stamp Bureau to stop issuing old stamps. At a time when the countryside is declining, disasters and droughts are frequent, and the market is sluggish, the hardship has reached its extreme, and it is impossible to bear this loss. Please submit this petition to the Ministry.' Another telegram from the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce stated the same reason as above. We have approved all of these. Therefore, we hereby telegraph your ministry for review and verification, and earnestly request that the old stamps be exchanged for new stamps in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, K., Qiao, Yin."</p>

<p>Excellent Scenic Tourist Destinations</p>
<p>Excellent Test Drive Results</p>
<p>Qiu Yuanxiong, Magistrate of Lishui County, Zhejiang Province, Telegraphs: "To the Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper Office, for examination. The Li Qing Highway, from Lishui to Qingtian, is 71 kilometers long. The entire line is adjacent to mountains and water, with excellent scenery. Shimen Cave, where Liu Wencheng studied, has high-hanging waterfalls, famous mountains, and historical sites, which are located in the middle of the road. The entire line of the road project is 90% open-cut mountains. The most difficult projects are Two Pagodas and Three Heavens (namely Pagoda Mountain, Pagoda Mountain Bay, Tianzi Bridge, Tianzi Ridge, Tianzi Well). The great bridges are Hao Creek, Jinshui, Maqi, Haikou, Chuanliao, and Shixi Bridges. It took one year, tens of thousands of people's sweat and blood, and 900,000 yuan in project costs to complete it on the 15th of this month. The Qing Wen Highway, from Qingtian to Wenzhou, is 52 kilometers long. The entire line of the project was also quite difficult, costing 500,000 yuan and ten months to complete on the 15th of this month. The Yong Le Highway, from Yongjia to Yueqing, is 40 kilometers long and was also completed at the same time as the Li Qing and Qing Wen Highways. This line has the Yandang Mountains, a world-renowned scenic spot, in the middle. In the past, transportation was inconvenient, and tourism was difficult. Now, the roads are open in all directions, and it is possible to reach here from Jing, Hu, and Hang on the same day. In total, from Lishui to Yueqing Yandang area, there are 164 kilometers. On the 16th of this month, the test drive was conducted, and the results were excellent. I am sending this by telegram, hoping for wide publicity and welcoming tourists. Qiu Yuanxiong, Magistrate of Lishui County and Highway Construction Supervisor, K."</p>

<p>Mr. Xu Jigong, former chairman of the Overseas Chinese Federation, was born in Taiwan. Twenty years ago, unable to bear the pain of Taiwan's loss, he abandoned his family and returned to the motherland, engaging in business in Shanghai, such as the Great China Record Company and the Tobacco Company. Around 1919 and 1920, he and overseas Chinese returning from Nanyang in Shanghai, such as Xie Bietian and Li Denghui, established the Overseas Chinese Federation, making many achievements. In 1929, he was elected as the chairman of the association. When the Shanghai War broke out, Mr. Xu witnessed the lack of food and salaries for the 19th Route Army. He and Zhu Qinglan, Zheng Hongnian, Xu Shiying, and others initiated the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Economic Committee to raise funds from overseas Chinese to help the military. Later, in view of the importance of publicity, he and Liu Shimu, Xie Nanguang, and others organized the Hualian News Agency to publicize the anti-Japanese work at home and abroad. Last year, the Overseas Chinese Federation was reorganized, and Mr. Xu gave the position of chairman to Chen Wulie, a Chinese from Thailand in Shanghai, and he himself became the vice chairman. This spring, after the Fujian Incident was quelled, Mr. Xu listened to the persuasion of friends and went to Xiamen to promote the construction of the ten counties in southern Fujian, dividing them into autonomous regions for returned overseas Chinese. He temporarily resided in Xiamen. The bad news came that Mr. Xu suffered a cerebral hemorrhage (commonly known as a stroke) in his apartment in Xiamen earlier this month. It only took about fifteen minutes, and he passed away. It is reported that after his wife and others received the news, they took a boat to Xiamen a few days ago to attend the funeral. They plan to transport the coffin to Shanghai for burial. His friends in Shanghai also plan to hold a memorial service to express their grief.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Responsible Person of the Garrison Department Discusses the Drug Situation in Shanghai <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Overview of Drug Cases　　Statistics on Compulsory Rehabilitation</p>
<p>Methods of Drug Rehabilitation　　Personal Views</p>
<p>Red pills and morphine have an enormous impact on individual happiness and national health. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the drug rehabilitation situation in this city, specifically visited the Longhua Command Headquarters and interviewed the responsible personnel of the department. They were informed of the recent drug rehabilitation situation in Shanghai as follows:</p>
<p>(Overview of Drug Cases) The prohibition of drugs in this city has always been taken very seriously. Since Chairman Chiang issued the regulations strictly prohibiting highly addictive drugs, the implementation has been swift and effective. In the first month of the implementation of the regulations, June, the Public Security Bureau arrested 435 people for compulsory rehabilitation. The numbers gradually decreased in July and August. However, on average, more than seven criminals are apprehended each month and are all sent by the Public Security Bureau to this headquarters for legal processing. According to the law, anyone who smokes or takes drugs is sent to the drug rehabilitation center for a limited period of compulsory rehabilitation. Those who are proven by the drug rehabilitation center to have completely quit are released on bail and may be summoned for investigation if they are involved in another case in the future. These types of drug offenders are the most numerous. Next are drug traffickers, followed by those who provide lighting for others to smoke red pills or administer morphine injections. Next are transporters, and finally, manufacturers. Those offenders whose circumstances are serious are subject to Article 14 of the Regulations Strictly Prohibiting Highly Addictive Drugs, which provides for a reduction of one-half of the death penalty, and a change to imprisonment for a term of no less than twelve years, as a show of leniency. In the past month, although drug offenders have continued to be sent in a steady stream, more than nine out of ten are smokers, and there are very few traffickers and manufacturers. This is something to be very gratifying to the society.</p>
<p>(Statistics on Compulsory Rehabilitation) After the command headquarters began handling drug cases, it was approved by the municipal government to allocate funds to set up a temporary drug rehabilitation center opposite the headquarters. Recently, the statistics compiled by the center for last month were reviewed. Among the 553 drug offenders who underwent rehabilitation at the center, 462 were male and 91 were female. In terms of age, 3 were under 20 years old, 141 were between 20 and 30 years old, 224 were between 31 and 40 years old, 134 were between 41 and 50 years old, and 51 were over 51 years old. Most of them are in their prime. It is truly unknown what afflicts them that they would waste their useful years on drugs. In addition, in terms of occupation, 294 were laborers, 151 were merchants, 23 were farmers, 8 were from the academic world, 3 were soldiers, and 74 were unemployed. However, some of the employed have already lost their jobs due to drug use. As for the time it took to break the drug addiction in the center, 499 people did so within ten days, 30 within twelve days, 17 within fourteen days, and 4 within sixteen days. Three people had their rehabilitation stopped due to serious illness.</p>
<p>(Methods of Drug Rehabilitation) Most hospitals use opium substitutes for drug rehabilitation, gradually reducing the dosage through (tapering). However, because the toxins in the blood are not eliminated, the addiction may return soon. After research by the Health Bureau, the headquarters' drug rehabilitation has changed to using (autologous serum). The method involves applying a mixture of pure ammonia and 10% camphor oil to the chest of the drug offender. After about half an hour, several small blisters will appear on the area. Use a warm towel compress, and after a considerable amount of time, after the small blisters have merged, the toxic fluid inside the blisters is extracted with a sterilized syringe and injected under the skin of the offender. In this way, the person undergoing rehabilitation will feel refreshed after one blistering injection. If the drug addiction is deep and there are still signs of withdrawal the next day, a second or third blistering injection can be given using the same method. After the third time, no one has failed to quit. In short, the regulations issued by Chairman Chiang this time impose severe penalties on those who traffic and manufacture drugs, while those who smoke or take drugs are sent for medical rehabilitation for the first time, released on bail, without imprisonment or fines. This combination of leniency and severity is enough to make the people fear the government's power and be grateful for its kindness. Therefore, since its implementation, the results have been remarkable. Currently, the only free drug rehabilitation hospital is the Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Center opposite this headquarters. However, due to financial constraints, it cannot accept many people who voluntarily seek rehabilitation. Currently, more than 200 people have registered, and more are coming in an endless stream. It is hoped that philanthropists will continue to establish more centers so that poor citizens can all escape their dark fate. As for the Special District Court of this city, drug offenders involving highly addictive drugs are still dealt with in accordance with the Opium Suppression Law. Will drug offenders who smoke red pills and morphine regard the concessions as a haven? Whether the drug prohibition efforts in the concessions will be effective, and whether the drug prohibition affairs in the interior will not be affected by the concessions are matters that we and the concession authorities should pay close attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Wang Xinshan, Assassin of Jin Menggen, Sentenced to Death <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Wang Repeatedly Proclaimed His Innocence</p>
<p>He Has Declared an Appeal</p>
<p>Jin Menggen, a local from Zhoujiaqiao, who ran the Shunxingyuan teahouse in the Shanghai West area and also worked as an inspector at the Shenxin Yarn Factory, left the Zhoujiaqiao teahouse at around 5:00 AM on April 30th of this year, intending to return to his home on Dajin Road. While walking on Hopiland Road, near his home, he was suddenly shot by an enemy and died instantly from his injuries. Afterwards, the local court detained Wang Xinshan (also known as Wang Axin or Wang Shengsan), who was suspected of being involved. After a clear preliminary trial by Prosecutor Zhang Zi, a public prosecution was filed under Article 284, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for premeditated murder. A public trial was held by Criminal Court President Liu Enrong, and the deceased's wife, Jin Liu, and Jin Bao, requested justice. Wang Xinshan repeatedly proclaimed his innocence. The judge explained the opening arguments, and after one round, the case was deemed clear and concluded, with the sentence scheduled for the 18th of this month. Yesterday was the scheduled date. At 2:00 PM, Judge Liu, accompanied by Assessors Shao Qinzhi and Yang Qianchang, specially opened the Third Tribunal to announce the verdict. Wang Xinshan, who was in custody, was brought to the case and briefly questioned before the verdict was announced in court: Wang Xinshan was found guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced to death. Wang did not accept the verdict and declared an appeal in court. The judge granted the appeal and instructed him to submit the reasons for the appeal in accordance with the law. After the sentence was announced, he was ordered to be returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>

<p>Shi Jinlin Sees Rat Enter Temple</p>
<p>Injured Along with the Temple Keeper</p>
<p>Next door to Hongyuan Paint Shop, No. 6, intersection of Lihong Bridge Pier, East Hanbi Li Road, and Dixiwei Road, Hongkou, is a Temple of the God of Wealth. Its incense has been quite prosperous. All affairs of the temple are maintained by the temple keeper Dong Anlin. However, the temple has already decayed, and is eroded by incense smoke daily. During winds and floods, it looks like it will collapse. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the owner of Hongyuan Paint Shop, Shi Jinlin of Shaoxing, was idling near the temple when he suddenly saw a large rat running under the altar of the God of Wealth. Shi thought such a large rat was a novelty, so he walked into the temple with the temple keeper to take a look. As they were talking, a loud noise suddenly came from the roof, and then the entire house, including the roof tiles and walls, collapsed at the same time. Shi and Dong were unable to escape and were buried in the bricks and tiles. A newspaper vendor woman near the temple was also affected. Fortunately, the guards nearby arrived and reported to the police station, who notified the fire brigade. The fire brigade immediately sent an ambulance to rescue the three from the rubble and took them to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, Shi Jinlin died from his injuries before arriving at the hospital and was sent to the coroner's office for an autopsy. Dong Anlin's injuries were also serious. The newspaper vendor woman's injuries were minor and not life-threatening.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Fish Vendor Kills Man with a Punch Over Crab Dispute <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yu Guilin Lashes Out with His Fist</p>
<p>Zhou Heshang Dies from Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Yu Guilin, 34 years old, from Minhang, has been transporting fresh fish, crabs, shrimps, etc., to Shanghai for sale at Yongtai Fish Shop, No. 46 Xiaodongmen Street, French Concession, to earn a meager profit and make a living. Yesterday morning, Yu transported several baskets of live crabs from the countryside to Shanghai and put them in front of Yongtai Fish Shop for sale. Zhou Heshang, 32 years old, from Haining, had a fresh fish stall at No. 103 Huanghe Road, French Concession, and made a living by selling fresh fish. At 5:15 AM yesterday morning, Zhou went to Xiaodongmen to pick up goods from his home. He bought crabs from Yu, weighing them and calculating the price at 3.2 yuan. Later, Zhou intended to buy another basket, but because there were too many dead crabs inside, he was afraid that he would not be able to sell them and would lose money, so he wanted to pick out some of them. Yu refused, and the two began to quarrel. Without saying a word, Yu punched Zhou with a fist, hitting his left rib. Zhou squatted on the ground, unable to get up. People were shocked and gathered around to watch. Chinese police officer No. 631 from the French Concession Police Station arrived and arrested the assailant Yu Guilin. He brought the injured person to the Xiaodongmen Police Station. The police chief ordered Zhou to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment and had Yu detained for investigation. However, Zhou died from his injuries. The hospital notified the police station, who sent investigators to transport the body to Tongren Yuandan Hall for an autopsy. Zhou Huang, the deceased's wife, and witnesses Wu Hongchang (Yongtai Fish Shop worker) and Yang Aqi (fish vendor) were summoned. At noon, the case was reported to the Second Special District Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren, accompanied by a forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at the hall to examine the body. Officer Zhang Chunsheng reported the case, and investigator Xu Jialin brought the accused assailant to the case. The official questioned the deceased's wife, the accused, and the witnesses. It was ruled that Zhou Heshang had died from internal injuries caused by being beaten. The body was handed over to Zhou Huang for burial. The accused was handed over to the police department for interrogation.</p>

<p>Friends Borrowed Money and Did Not Return It, Damaging His Reputation Instead</p>
<p>Teng Held a Party with Singers Before Committing Suicide</p>
<p>At 12:00 AM the night before last, a man wearing a suit and a young woman checked into room 107 of the Dadong Hotel at No. 94 Xixinqiao Street, French Concession, agreeing to a room rate of 1.2 yuan. The man identified himself as He Chongru, 32 years old, from Guangdong. As usual, the hotel servant brought tea and water. Suddenly, the guest ordered the servant to call singers from the street to the room to sing and have fun, and then closed the door to sleep. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the young woman got up and went out alone. At 11:00 AM, the guest ordered the servant to buy a plate of soup dumplings. He ate alone in the room. Unexpectedly, when eating the sixth soup dumpling, the guest could not support himself and fell to the ground, foaming at the mouth. The servant was shocked and reported to the accounting office and the French Concession Police Station. Investigator Liu Dianlong was dispatched to investigate. The guest was already dead. A Portuguese citizen certificate was found in his pocket, with the name Teng Tom, etc. Liu went to the Portuguese Consulate to inquire and learned that the deceased was not He Chongru, but Teng Tom, who ran the Dechang Jewelry Store on Broadway, Hongkou. They went to the store to investigate his family. It was said that a friend of Teng's had borrowed more than 30,000 yuan from him, but not only did he not return it, but he also published articles damaging his reputation. Therefore, Teng was angry and committed suicide by taking poison. Afterwards, a clerk from the store arrived at the scene to inspect and confirmed the details. The body was then transported to a funeral home for storage.</p>

Now it is learned that Fangcheng has filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the District Court, accusing Abbot monk Xingkong of coercion and intimidation, requesting an investigation. Upon instructions, the case was transferred to the Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhao Fujia ordered the plaintiff, monk Fangcheng, and Abbot monk Xingkong, monk Yuanming, Chen Rudan (office worker at the Longhua Temple East Tibetan-Mongolian Academy), and Wu Rugui (head of the Longhua Town Defense Corps) to appear in court for questioning.

<h3 id="e134">Yan Luqing's Appeal Case Concluded <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 25th of This Month</p>
<p>Lawyer Yan Luqing was previously involved in a case where he allegedly demanded compensation of 60,000 yuan from the families of suspects Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue in the robbery case of Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm. The French Concession Police Department prosecuted him in the Second Special District Court on suspicion of extortion. As a result, he was sentenced to one year and six months in prison and fined 800 yuan. Because Yan did not accept the judgment, he filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The High Court approved the appeal and scheduled a hearing for 4:00 PM yesterday, to be heard by a collegial panel consisting of Court President Guo Dezhang, Sun Honglin, Fan Peien, and Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei. Lawyer Fei Xizhen represented the Police Department in court. The appellant Yan Luqing, accompanied by his lawyers Dong Kang, Shi Liang, and Peng Qi, appeared in court. Witnesses Zhao Zhongdi, Sun Zuji (lawyer), Pan Hongding (Shanghai Municipal Committee Member of Qingdong High Bank), Huang Xingzhong, and interested parties Zhou Jinggeng and others were summoned. After the court was convened, the appellant Yan Luqing was first summoned to the case, questioned about his age, origin, and residence. Then, he was asked: "The Second Special District Court sentenced you to two years and six months in prison and fined you 800 yuan for the extortion case. What are your reasons for appealing?" He replied, "The original judgment was wrong and was completely based on the words of the witnesses. Those witnesses are all their shop assistants, relatives, friends, lawyers, etc. The testimonies they provided are all contradictory." He was asked, "Did you instruct Tang Wenshou, the family member of Tang Qingyue, to ask for 2,000 yuan for a private settlement?" He replied, "No." He was asked, "Was it not you and Zhou Jinggeng who delivered the money to you by Pan Hongding at Sun Zuji's law firm?" He replied, "At 12:30 PM on June 21st, Zhou Jinggeng went to pick it up alone. I was having lunch in the Western restaurant and was not at the scene. The manager of the Western restaurant testified during the first instance." He was asked, "Have you been to Ruichangshun and Zhuangyuanda?" He replied, "Zhao Zhongdi invited me to see them, meaning that Zhang Zuming and Zhuang Jimeng were shopkeepers and had professions and would not be robbers, so I went to see them." He was asked, "Did you ask Zhang Zuyin of Ruichangshun for 60,000 yuan for a private settlement?" He replied, "No, that's completely wrong." He was asked, "Did you go to Zhuangyuanda immediately after leaving Ruichangshun?" He replied, "Zhao Zhongdi also invited me. I went with Zhou Jinggeng, Zhou's nephew Zhou Juren, and Zhao." He was asked, "Did you ask Zhang Yuquan of Zhuangyuanda for 60,000 yuan for a private settlement?" He replied, "No." He was asked, "Did you ask Sun Zuji for 6,000 yuan when he went to Xiahui Road to find a guarantor?" He replied, "I came out of the police station and returned to the office. I ran into him on the road in a car. He said that I asked him for money, which is completely fabricated." He was asked, "Did you ask Sun Zuji to exchange conditions when he called?" He replied, "Sun called to ask me for help. I replied that a private lawsuit was possible, but a public lawsuit was not possible, but I did not call him." He was asked, "Sun Zuji and Pan Hongding said that Pan put 2,000 yuan in banknotes on the counter of Sun's law firm, and you took it away?" He replied, "I have never been to Sun Zuji's law firm." He was asked, "Apart from the inconsistent testimonies of the witnesses, do you have any other reasons?" He replied, "My witnesses testified that I was eating in the Western restaurant." The official summoned witness Zhao Zhongdi to the case, who stated that he was 29 years old, from Wuxi, and lived at No. 1004 Broadway, and had no relationship with lawyer Yan. On June 17th, he went to the French Concession Police Station for Zhang Zuming and was detained overnight. The next morning, when he left the police station, lawyer Yan and Zhou Jinggeng greeted him when he hired a car in front of the door. I took their car to the Xue Mailuo office first, and then to Ruichangshun. I made three phone calls inside, and they were talking outside. I vaguely heard a few loud words, but I didn't know the details. Later, Zhou Jinggeng wanted Zhang Zuyin to go to Zhuangyuanda, but Zhang refused, so he asked me to accompany him. When we arrived at Zhuangyuanda, I went to the accounting room, and they were in the reception room. I don't know what they said. At first, I told Yan and Zhou in the police station that Zhang Zuming and others were old shopkeepers who wouldn't be robbers. If they didn't believe me, they could go and see their shops. The official summoned Zhou Jinggeng, who stated that he was a comprador at Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm. On June 18th, Zhao Zhongdi invited him to go with lawyer Yan to see Ruichangshun and Zhuangyuanda. We first went to Ruichangshun, and Zhao greeted him and introduced him to a big man. I told him that 6,000 yuan had been robbed on May 13th last year and that 12,000 yuan had been robbed this time. I did not mention asking for 60,000 yuan for a private settlement. Later, at Zhuangyuanda, I sat down in the reception room. After they served tea, I wanted to call my own writing room, but I couldn't get through, so I went back. At that time, I saw Zhang Yuquan, Zhuang Duanmeng's father-in-law, who was an old friend of lawyer Yan. When I left, Zhao Zhongdi sent me to the door and left. Lawyer Sun Zuji called me to pick up Tang Qingyue's 2,000 yuan. Later, Tang was declared not guilty and wrote a letter asking to return the money. I have returned the money in full, and there is a receipt as proof. According to the testimony of witnesses Sun Zuji, Pan Hongding, Huang Xingzhong, etc., the situation at that time was the same as that provided in the first instance and published in various newspapers, so it will not be repeated here. After the witnesses were questioned, the court ordered the opening of arguments. The three lawyers Dong, Shi, and Peng, hired by the appellant, and the Police Department's lawyer debated. The prosecutor then expressed his opinion. The court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for 2:00 PM on the 25th. When the court adjourned, the clock struck seven.</p>

<p>Sentenced to One Month in Prison</p>
<p>Zhu Yongyu, from Yangzhou, runs a fruit stall near Yulin Road. At around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, Xu Degong, from Funing, who sells gardenias, passed by. Zhu took a gardenia from him and gave him a copper coin. Because he thought it was too little, they quarreled. At that time, Du Linggao, from Jiangbei, mediated and asked him to increase the amount. Zhu became furious, thinking that he was deliberately interfering, and spoke harshly. A fight broke out. Zhu was no match for him and took a fruit knife from the stall and stabbed Du in the face and shoulder twice, causing him to fall to the ground and bleed profusely. Chinese police officer Pan Yunlong heard the alarm and arrested Zhu, along with the murder weapon, and took him to the Yulin Road Police Station for detention. The injured person was taken to Shengxin Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, his injuries were not serious. After the doctor bandaged him, he was discharged from the hospital. Zhu was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. 工部局 lawyer Li Zhishan described the previous situation and presented the murder weapon. Du Linggao and Xu Dehua testified about what happened. Questioned the defendant, whose testimony was evasive.

<h3 id="e137">Newspaper Vendors Scramble to Open Packages and Get Newspapers at the Station <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau Resolutely Cracks Down</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that when various Shanghai newspapers arrive at the Nanjing Xiaguan Station by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway train every day, they are delivered by the on-board post office near the station. As a result, newspaper vendors scramble to enter the platform and open the packages themselves to get the newspapers, causing chaos and throwing the packaging paper all over the ground. This has greatly affected the order and cleanliness of the station. The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has sent a letter to the Shanghai Daily Association, informing the Nanjing managers of each newspaper that in the future, newspapers should not be unpacked and distributed within the station platform. The Daily Association replied that it had been resolved at a meeting that in addition to sending letters to the Nanjing branches of each member newspaper, they would send personnel to the station to receive the newspapers and would not unpack and distribute the newspapers within the platform. The Railway Administration was requested to order the police and stationmaster to take measures to crack down on this. This would not only maintain order at the station, but also allow the newspaper recipients of each branch to carry the newspapers out of the station and unpack them for distribution. It is hoped that this will be taken into consideration. After receiving this letter, the Railway Bureau immediately ordered the Traffic Department and the Police Department to designate a nearby location outside the station as a place for unpacking and distributing newspapers. However, Nanjing newspaper vendors threatened not to distribute newspapers. It is reported that the Railway Bureau has decided to persist in this measure in order to maintain order within the station.</p>

<p>Discussing the Construction of the Municipal Central District Clubhouse</p>
<p>The Zhabei District Fire Fighting Association previously, during the completion period of the new municipal government, in order to pay attention to fire protection facilities in the city center and ensure local safety, drafted an explanatory memorandum on a large-scale fire fighting association construction plan and drew up drawings, which were submitted to the municipal government to allocate land for application at a suitable location, so as to emphasize fire protection and enhance the appearance. Now it is heard that this design has been adopted by Mayor Wu and approved to allocate a piece of land near the Seventh District Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau for the construction of the association. Therefore, a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees was convened yesterday to discuss the implementation steps. Wang Xiaolai, Wang Binyan, Chen Weihan, and dozens of section chiefs and others attended. The following methods were resolved: (1) Submit a request to the Public Security Bureau and the Land Bureau to send personnel to jointly set up boundary stones at the address to serve as a basis for planning drawings. (2) Enclose the land within the designated foundation with bamboo fences and order craftsmen to plant trees and fill mud, completing the construction within the shortest possible period. (3) Explain the situation to each director and supervisor, jointly conduct fund-raising for construction costs, and solicit enthusiastic local public welfare workers to be appointed as directors, so as to gather the strength of the group to jointly plan the implementation. Other important cases were then discussed, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>The British-owned Taikoo Company's Yangtze River steamer Poyang is to be dismantled due to its age.

In addition, they will receive severance pay equivalent to two months' wages including promotions.

<h3 id="e143">New Organization of the Datong Music Society <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Teaching Guqin and Pipa</p>
<p>Editing National Music Magazine</p>
<p>The Datong Music Society in this city has cultivated a large number of professional talents in ancient music over the years. Since participating in the performance of ancient music during the Confucius birthday celebration this year, it has gained considerable social recognition. Therefore, the number of people seeking to study at the society has increased. Therefore, the society has expanded its operations. In addition to the Guqin class taught by Zheng Jinwen, the director of music affairs of the society, and the Pipa class taught by Wei Zhongle, the deputy director of music affairs, special classes such as Konghou and Da Se have been added, which are all available for students to choose from. Tuition fees remain the same: individual teaching is four yuan per month, and general class teaching is two yuan per month, which is truly a unique opportunity for those who study national music. (For regulations, please send one cent for postage to the society at No. 36 Songshan Road for a copy). National music is where the national spirit of our country lies. Now, it has deteriorated to the extreme. In recent years, after various promotions, it has slightly improved. However, without accurate publications, it is inevitable that everyone will go their own way, like scattered sand. It is still feared that it will be difficult to sustain. For this reason, in addition to organizing musical scores and manufacturing musical instruments, the society has also established a department for editing national music magazines. The content is divided into four categories: music theory, musical instruments, music songs, and music dances, plus a literature section. The authors are all contemporary celebrities, and the materials are very rich, which is truly an indispensable move in today's national music scene.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Rent Reduction Committee Urges Quick Determination of Rent Reduction Standards <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>A Response to the Memorandum of the Real Estate Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee recently stated that the rent reduction issue has not been resolved, which has greatly affected the social economy and market commerce. Therefore, it was resolved to explain the reasons in detail and appeal to the Executive Yuan and the Shanghai Municipal Government to quickly set rent reduction standards to resolve disputes. It is learned that the document has been drafted by Li Shirui, a design member of the committee, and has been approved and issued by the committee. The original text lists various reasons in great detail. Therefore, an excerpt is provided below to urge the quick determination of rent reduction standards for implementation. Rents in this city are expensive. The income of citizens who work hard is more than half taken by landlords. As a result, the necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation cannot be met. Various grievances have been stated on record. It has been half a year, and no clear order has been received to resolve the issue. Although there are a few enlightened landlords who automatically reduce rents, those who want to be unrestrained still impose excessive taxes and demand strict collections. Landlords and tenants confront each other, and lawsuits continue. This is truly a widespread and profound disaster in this city, just as severe as the severe drought in the countryside. After repeated consideration, the committee believes that if the rent reduction issue is not resolved for a day, not only will this city become increasingly depressed and gradually collapse, but its impact will affect the national finance and even the overall commodity market and production business, and the landlords will also suffer the same consequences without escape. The committee's request for rent reduction is by no means to represent only the one-sided interests of tenants, nor is it to exploit landlords for self-enrichment, just as the Real Estate Association said, "Being in the same boat during a storm, we should understand each other." (1) The population of this city is said to be 3.4 million, but the actual household registration in the concession is surveyed every five years. Each time a survey is conducted, there is no organization, lack of technology, and the actual population number is greatly missed. Therefore, the population of the city should be estimated at least at 5 million or more. Among a metropolis of 5 million people, how many people can hold real estate and houses? Let's assume that 10,000 people directly hold real estate houses, and 40,000 people indirectly hold real estate mortgage rights or real estate shares. The remaining 4.95 million people are tenants who pay rent every month. If the city's house prices rise sharply, the beneficiaries are 50,000 people, and the victims are 4.95 million people. If house prices fall, the clear beneficiaries are 4.95 million people, and the victims are 50,000 people. Should the government authorities and those responsible for social responsibility protect the interests of the smallest number of people and exploit more than 99% of the public, or should they take into account the interests of the largest number of people, so that they can coexist and prosper with the smallest number of landlords? This is the premise for discussing rent prices and should not be ignored. (To be continued)</p>

The Second District Police Bureau immediately ordered the guarantor Gu Xueyuan to report to the District Court to request an autopsy. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang and autopsy examiners were commissioned to the scene. The autopsy revealed that the deceased was wearing a blue cloth short shirt, a white cloth short shirt underneath, a plain-colored pair of trousers, bronze-colored thread socks, and rubber shoes. There were no wounds on his body. It was determined that he died of illness. A form was filled out, photos were taken, and it was ordered that a coffin be prepared and stored pending notification for family members to claim the body.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Joint Meeting of the Rent Reduction Association in the South District the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee held a joint meeting of executive committee members of all district branches in the assembly hall of the association on Minguo Road the day before yesterday. Representatives from eighty-odd branches including the First Special District Sima Road and Second Special District Chongde Fang were in attendance. Yan Zhen was elected as chairman, and Ni Yi as secretary. After performing the ceremony, the following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the case of the landlord of Qingyun Lane, Zhizaoyu Road, cutting off the water supply without reason and falsely claiming rent arrears to the court for eviction, what measures should be taken? It was resolved that evidence of the impact of the water cut-off should be collected, and in addition to submitting a request to the party and government authorities, a lawsuit should be filed with the court to claim damages for the loss. As for the rent arrears, if a storage bank passbook is presented, the association is responsible for guaranteeing it. (2) Regarding the case of all tenants of Baoren Lane, Guohuo Road, suing the landlord in the District Court, the defendant in the first instance was not present, and there has been no further summons for two months, what should be done? It was resolved that a petition should be submitted to urge the summons. (3) The rent reduction dispute in Chengzhi Lane has been going on for four months. The landlord falsely filed a lawsuit. The court's judge was fully aware of the business difficulties and reduced the rent by four yuan per month, which has been resolved. It was resolved that the case be filed for record. (4) Rent reduction in Nanjing and Anqing has long been resolved, and the Hangzhou Municipal Government has decided that from September, rent will be paid at 70% of the original amount across the city. The situation in Shanghai's Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong is the same as that in the interior, and has been greatly affected by the (September 18th Incident) and (January 28th Incident), which is greater than in the interior. The rent reduction measures should be the same as in the interior at a minimum. If the landlord refuses to accept it, what should be done? It was resolved that the rent be deposited in a bank. (5) Landlords rely on the law and repeatedly initiate lawsuits. Tenants have tolerated it repeatedly to maintain relations, but the courthouse is as crowded as a marketplace, and business is as deserted as a bird's nest. Prolonged disputes are not a long-term solution. What should be done properly? It was resolved that all merchants and residents in the district should file a lawsuit with the court based on Article 74 of the Civil Code and Article 442 of the same law, demanding that landlords across the district reduce rents. The amount of rent and the year of construction will be the responsibility of each branch. If there is no branch, they may join the association. (6) All tenants in Sanduo Lane, Fangxie Road, have been forced to move by the landlord and request the association's assistance. It was resolved that a letter should be sent to the landlord first to withdraw the order. If the landlord refuses, more forceful measures will be taken. (7) The association published the Shanghai Rent Reduction Special Issue and submitted it to the Municipal Government for transfer to the Ministry of the Interior, and the Municipal Party Department for transfer to the Central Propaganda Department. Although enthusiasts have subsidized it by a dime per month, more than 150,000 copies have been distributed, and the fee is less than 5%. Because the fee is not generally collected, there are occasional criticisms, and the funding is insufficient. What should be done? It was resolved that publication should continue, and the expenses should be borne by the committee members. From the fifth issue onwards, distribution will be measured. If businesses and residents want to read the special issue, they must subscribe in advance. (8) The Bifang Lane branch has resolved the rent reduction since joining the association, and it has promised to contribute to the district (for the benefit of society). How should it be expressed? It was resolved that the association strives to solve the problems of the masses with the pain of our own body. Although the sincerity is commendable, it is inevitable that there will be outside criticism. It is hoped that the branches will not do this again in the future.</p>

<p>All Tenants in the Lane Hold an Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The houses in Sanduo Lane, Fangxie Road, Ximen, Nanshi, belong to the Lan Guangyu Hall industry. They were rebuilt not long ago and are still strong and large. Unexpectedly, the landlord suddenly sent a large number of workers to build bamboo fences at 1 pm the day before yesterday, claiming that they must be rebuilt immediately and ordered the tenants to leave the houses. The tenants in the entire lane panicked and argued with the workers, pushing down all the bamboo fences, almost leading to violence. That night, all tenants in the lane held an emergency meeting. More than twenty households, including Zhu Ronglin, Ma Zengshou, Chen Shufu, Wei Songqing, Chen Yingzhou, Grandma Bao, Fan Qande, and Mao Chuntang, attended. Wei Songqing was elected as chairman, and he gave a report (omitted). Discussion: (1) It was agreed that the landlord's demolition was due to the failure to increase the rent. Using the excuse of rebuilding, without prior notice or seeking consent, and ordering the tenants to leave the houses, was illegal. What should be done? It was resolved that: A. The facts and circumstances should be reported to the party and government authorities, requesting assistance and upholding justice. B. Before the case is resolved, the rent due should be deposited in a bank for safekeeping. (2) How should the procedures for establishing the Sanduo Lane, Fangxie Road branch be carried out?

<p>The traditional Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching. Due to thousands of years of custom, it is still difficult to eliminate it immediately.

The Sichuan Store headquarters on Damalu (near Pentang Lane) in this city has been selling Sichuan white fungus for many years and has a reputation for genuine goods at fair prices. Those who buy Sichuan white fungus, to avoid losses and being deceived, must go to Sichuan Store. The store's beautifully packaged white fungus in square boxes is given to relatives and friends and is particularly welcomed by the recipients. The store's white fungus has gained such deep trust from people in this city and other places, which is also due to the store's many years of serious handling of goods and very courteous service.</p>

<p>丨丨 Answer to Mr. Yuan Qingyan</p>
<p>The previous day, this article was suspended for one day because the (Reading News) was suspended. In the past two days, the main points of Mr. Yuan's letter have been extracted, and the general common problems of young people in this matter have been generally discussed. Today, I will focus on the attitude towards occupation to explain the reason for Mr. Yuan's worries. (Editor)</p>
<p>The root cause of Mr. Yuan's incorrect attitude towards occupation is nothing more than a problem belonging to the aspect of the attitude of young people towards life, which has already been discussed above. In principle, the above remarks can be said to have been answered. However, I still want to talk about it in more detail. Mr. Yuan used to plan to find his own way out in the rice business. This cannot be said to be wrong in terms of Mr. Yuan's actual life. However, Mr. Yuan cannot regard the rice business as an isolated thing that has no connection with everything else in society. If you just close your eyes and don't look at society and think that you can find all your hopes in the rice business, that is a big mistake. You must know that the rice business is only the smallest part of the entire society, like a small screw needle on a clock (this analogy is of course not very accurate, because the rice business has not the same relationship to society as a screw needle to the clock). It is responsible for circulating a bit of supply and is needed in today's social structure. However, it is impossible to estimate its survival and development separately. It will be affected by thousands of other social relations. If you close your eyes and want to find a way out in the rice business, the result will disappoint you sooner or later. When you see this, you may ask me, what kind of occupation in the world is fixed and can be completely unaffected by society? I replied! My friend, there is no such occupation in the world. In today's society, a change in one place will affect the whole. Who can be sure that their hopes will count? Here, I have told you, don't complain about your job, any other noble occupation is no different. Maybe you will ask me further, in this way, since everything we individuals rely on is an iceberg, what hope and way out is there in life? Then it is better to just get by. My friend, if you ask such a question, then I have to point out that this is wrong. This is your wrong view. You shouldn't just focus on the immediate interests of the individual. I have already said that it is impossible to find a way out starting from one person alone. You may have food to eat for the time being, or even a little extra, but if everyone around you has no food to eat, you cannot eat peacefully alone. People always want to survive! If there is no way to go, who doesn't want to find a way out? But to find a way out, don't go around in circles in an alley. You also need to find out which road this alley leads to, and how this road is connected to other roads. As for waiting to starve to death because you can't find a way out in the alley or because you failed to find one, that's only what the fewest people who have no life will do. There is always a way out in life! You have to put individual problems in the masses to solve. In an era when the masses cannot survive, naturally individuals cannot survive either. Then we should not plan too high for individual advantages and disadvantages, but pay attention to the interests of everyone that are the premise of my own survival. For example, when the Chinese nation is facing a serious crisis, we should focus our attention on the life and death of this great crisis. As for individual life? Naturally, we cannot ignore it, but we should not ignore society, and individuals should not demand too good a life or too fantastic a life. In this era, everyone should learn to endure hardships and live on solid ground, and should no longer sleep in the drum and daydream. As for occupation? We believe that as long as there is a little understanding of the purpose of struggle for individual life, any occupation is possible, and there is nothing noble or lowly. Our attitude towards occupation is to maintain the minimum level of existence. We should not have too high hopes for occupation, and at the same time, we will not have unbearable disappointments. Our social relations send me to the rice business, working as a street runner and river porter is of course very possible, even if my social relations are not so (noble), and can only let me work as a coolie, fill tea, pull a rickshaw, sell newspapers, or scrub people in a bathhouse, etc., what can't be done? It is all about seeking survival. People sing a certain song in a certain place and in a certain situation. As long as you still want to be a human being and have a certain goal, although occupations have high and low status, why insult myself? Why hate it. Of course, if you fantasize about being the chairman of the National Government when you are bored, that is not necessary. Because that is a harmful fantasy, not only can it not be realized, but it is also contrary to the overall social purpose by 18,000 miles.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao: In the "Local News" section of your esteemed newspaper dated September 17th, there was a report about the grand occasion of the Singapore Exhibition of Chinese Industrial Products. It stated that the clocks and watches exhibited by the famous Shanghai National Products Company were produced by the "Guangming Electric Company." This is an error; they were produced by the "Changming Electric Company." Please correct this error in your next issue. Respectfully submitted to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao by Changming Electric Company Limited, September 18th. Yesterday, I read in your local news column a story titled "Daughter Lost and Found, Rejoicing Like Returning a Pearl." The article stated that Mrs. Du Qian, a local woman residing at Chu Jia Qiao, was the person involved. This is a mistake; it should have been Mrs. Gui Li. The two surnames were interchanged, which does not align with the facts. It is likely a writing error by your reporter. We earnestly request a correction.

<p>Regarding the fourth point, "Placing all Chinese schools under Party control," I am a returned overseas Chinese and a member of the Chinese Nationalist Party. Regarding overseas Party affairs and overseas Chinese affairs, in spirit and duty, I feel deeply ashamed about this statement. According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's investigation last year, there are over 1,900 overseas Chinese schools. Fewer than ten are complete secondary schools; the rest are primary schools. Of these 1,900-plus schools, only about 110 have been registered with our Nationalist Government over the years. Despite the government's encouragement, over several years, less than 10% of these schools have a direct connection with the motherland. It's not just my personal disappointment; everyone involved in overseas Chinese education finds it strange. Because a country and its overseas citizens having a close cultural and educational relationship is natural, not exceptional. Our government is not even capable of making this obvious effort. Mr. Clementi insists that the Chinese Nationalist Party is placing all Chinese schools under Party control. We believe this is not malicious propaganda, but excessive flattery, making us feel so ashamed we want to disappear. Furthermore, 99.9% of overseas Chinese schools are primary schools. As mentioned above, the government's relationship with these schools is not close, and the students are young and lack knowledge. How can we talk about Party control? England is a leader in education. Even there, primary school students are not qualified to discuss politics. How much less so with the level of overseas Chinese students? The intelligent British government should be aware of this. Even Mr. Clementi, known as an "expert on China," probably laughs at himself for being overly concerned. As for how overseas Chinese education should be promoted and improved so that overseas Chinese students can achieve balanced development of their knowledge and maintain coexistence with other ethnic groups in their places of residence, this is originally worthy of the common attention of both Chinese and British people, but it is not appropriate to discuss it in this article.</p>
<p>Regarding the fifth point, "Compiling textbooks to instill anti-British thought," the words are consistent, but the events are different. Mr. Clementi used this as one of the reasons for dissolving the Malayan Chinese Nationalist Party. Therefore, "compiling" naturally refers to the Nationalist Party compiling. May I ask what textbooks the Nationalist Party has compiled? What are the titles of the books? On which pages does the anti-British thought appear? Books are evidence; they cannot be falsely accused. As far as we know (and the British government also knows), not only has the Malayan Chinese Nationalist Party not "compiled textbooks," but even the Chinese Nationalist Government's Ministry of Education has not "compiled textbooks." If there is any "compilation," it is by commercial publishers such as the Chung Hwa Book Company and the Commercial Press. It is definitely not compiled by the Malayan Chinese Nationalist Party. Mr. Clementi has the power as governor to dissolve the Nationalist Party; he should not exaggerate the facts to intimidate the British government. These textbooks compiled by merchants are mostly for business purposes. They are displayed in bookstores and people can choose what to buy. Readers have the freedom to choose. Furthermore, Mr. Clementi, as the head of Malaya, has already exercised his power to ban them. Why then use this as an excuse to dissolve the Malayan Chinese Nationalist Party? We believe Mr. Clementi has misspoke. Recalling last year, the Chung Hwa Book Company in Singapore, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, specially invited Dr. Luo Liangzhu to edit various primary school textbooks. These were approved by the local Director of Education and ordered to be adopted by Chinese schools in various places. If such carefulness cannot avoid suspicion, it is not only a grave accusation against overseas Chinese but also implicates the local Director of Education. May I ask if Mr. Clementi would tolerate having a Director of Education under him with anti-British thoughts? (To be continued)</p>

<p>The young mistress got up especially early today to send a relative off on a ship. She got up at nine o'clock, and her whole day's demeanor was consequently listless. In the evening, she told the young master, "I slept two or three hours less this morning, and I felt unwell all day. The ancients said, 'The planning for the day lies in the morning!' How true those words are!"</p>
<h3 id="e158">Fishing Season <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>September has arrived; in my hometown, September is the fishing season.</p>
<p>On the river, swollen with the autumn tide, those newly painted fishing boats, just dragged from the shipyard, floated like yellow leaves. On the night of the full moon in the fifteenth day, the fishermen would buy big fish and meat and piously worship the river god, so that he would protect them on their voyage. That night, they would heartily eat a meal of family reunion wine, then excitedly return to the boats, raise a small white sail, and leave their wives and children, braving danger to fight against the fierce winds and waves for a livelihood!</p>
<p>The women stood on the riverbank, watching the little seagull-like fishing boats drift downstream. A feeling of fear and hope weighed on their hearts. They murmured blessings for calm winds and tranquil waves ahead. They fervently hoped for a large catch of fish and a safe return.</p>
<p>If the merciless heavens sent violent storms and heavy rain, then they would hysterically cry out, disregarding the cold, disregarding the rain, running to the riverbank like madmen, watching the vast, turbulent river and wailing, or kneeling in the rain, praying to the heavens. How pitiful they are!</p>
<p>In recent years, boat rentals are high, taxes are numerous, fish prices are low, and the encroachment of foreign ships has added to the difficulty of fishing! Fishermen are forever struggling with hunger and death, but who among those who savor the fish knows how much of the fishermen's blood and sweat is mixed into this delicious taste?</p>
<h3 id="e159">September 18th and the Mid-Autumn Festival <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— A Teacher in Retirement</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident left a huge mark of shame, up to today's September 18th, I fear the masses have faintly forgotten it, and only remember "The bright moon on August 15th"!</p>
<p>Thinking about September 18th in the past, we only shouted slogans, posted posters, and wrote propaganda articles. In the end, we left behind a commemorative day for raising flags and holding ceremonies, just for decoration.</p>
<p>Isn't the decoration of the Mid-Autumn Festival right before our eyes? Tall, beautiful incense towers, piled like pagodas; layers of delicious mooncakes, stacked like mountains; and all the other associated expenses. Which family doesn't spend money to prepare for the grand Mid-Autumn Festival? Who bothers with the nonsense of September 18th!</p>
<p>In the hall for commemorating the day of shame of September 18th, the adults and gentlemen, as usual, give speeches, with extremely mournful words. Someone said that after his speech, he might ask his wife to buy incense towers and mooncakes to decorate the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>The masses all clapped their hands in unison. Amidst the applause, they dispersed in a crowd, busy buying incense towers and mooncakes, having long ago lightly tossed September 18th to the back of their minds.</p>
<p>There's a saying: "The toad insults the osprey; what is said is said, what is heard is heard." I ask, what do you think of this analogy?</p>
<h3 id="e160">Shadow of Xiangshan Pagoda <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Bingyuan</p>
<p>Xiangshan County in Guangdong Province, also known as "Iron City," is a famous and large county in the province, with the reputation of "lying down and earning 100,000" in the Qing Dynasty. This means that whoever governs this county does not need to work hard to accumulate wealth, and can safely lie down and earn 100,000 taels of silver annually. It is truly a coveted position. In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the revolutionary government established its capital in Nanjing. Because this county is the hometown of Sun Yat-sen, it was specially renamed "Zhongshan County" and planned as a model county for the whole country, to show respect and commemorate him! Outside the west city of the county, there is a port called "Shiqi," which has been developed for decades. Chinese and foreigners live together, with countless sails and masts standing like a forest. It is a hub connecting the provinces, Hong Kong, and Macau, and ships can reach it directly in eight hours, making transportation extremely convenient. This is also the biggest reason for the prosperity of the county. From the west city district to the port, there is a thoroughfare called "West Gate Street," where shops line up densely and the essence of commerce gathers. However, although this city gate is set up, it is usually closed, and pedestrians must go around through the north and south gates. People are used to this and do not find it strange, nor do they find it a hardship to rush around. According to the old custom, it is only opened once on the eve of the Lunar New Year and on the morning of New Year's Day. The idea is that the end of the year and the beginning of the year are the days of cyclical renewal, and opening it once during this period can represent that it has not been closed during the year. How ridiculous the trends of the world are!</p>
<p>When it is about to be opened, the county magistrate informs everyone, acting quite solemnly. The restrictions are also extremely strict. If the gatekeeper accidentally opens or closes the gate at the wrong time, it is immediately recorded in the register. This shows the authority of the feudal system and is also due to superstition. On the riverbank opposite the west gate, there is a towering pagoda on Shanggang Hill, which was first built in the Tang Dynasty. Foreigners coming to China for trade all landed in Xiangshan County. This pagoda was used to observe the wind direction for navigation. It has a total of seventeen levels, directly facing the west gate. Every day at Wei time (1-3 pm), when the sun begins to decline, the shadow of the pagoda is reflected by the sunlight and falls into the circle of the city gate. This miracle only occurs in cloudy weather, when the sunlight is dim and the shadow is faintly visible. If the sun is blazing and there are no clouds, it cannot be seen. The construction is so strange that it seems to be the work of divine craftsmanship! Judging by scientific principles, there must be a great invention, but unfortunately no one has studied it. Because of occasional instances of unruly behavior by the people, it is blamed on the reflection of the pagoda shadow into the city gate circle. Over the generations, this explanation has been insisted upon, and so officials and people work together to tightly close the west gate to block the pagoda shadow. For hundreds of years, there has been no criticism, and the elders especially enjoy talking about it. When I left my hometown at the age of nine, when I said goodbye to the pagoda, I still saw the west gate tightly closed, as if deeply worried about the shadow's intrusion. Now that the county is called a model, and all affairs of state are flourishing, the city no longer exists. What the pagoda looks like, I cannot know. Perhaps after the changes of time, if the pagoda has a spirit, it will also follow the revolution and first revolutionize its heart, and now promote social customs of honesty and kindness?</p>
<h3 id="e161">Records of Fragrant Incense飘渺 <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Except for his angry expression, Guangxu did not say anything or move his limbs. He clearly held the traitor who sold his freedom in utter contempt. His excessive coldness clearly told everyone that even though his one and only person—Yuan Shikai—was kneeling before him, he acted as if he did not see him.</p>
<p>Yuan Shikai was not unaware of the expression on Guangxu's face, but he already knew that this pitiful character could no longer take any action, so he paid absolutely no attention and remained very calm. After greeting the Empress Dowager, he casually said a few words. At the same time, the band, which was meant to be part of the grand welcoming ceremony, began to play. The band that Yuan Shikai had prepared was not ancient Chinese music, but a very pure Western band. There were probably twenty people, using the same instruments as a brass band in a foreign army. It is said that the bandleader was a student whom Yuan Shikai had paid to study music and composition in Germany. His technique was indeed very good. Especially at that time, he could truly be said to be one of the best Western musicians in China. After returning to China, he spent all his time teaching the young military officers whom Yuan Shikai had personally selected how to play Western music. It must have taken quite some time, because I heard them play very well!</p>
<p>Because Yuan Shikai himself was of military background, he deliberately made the various ceremonies for welcoming the Empress Dowager as military as possible. In addition to this band composed of twenty young military officers, he also brought in a large contingent of troops, all wearing helmets and armor, neatly arranged about a hundred yards from the platform, bowing to the Empress Dowager from afar. I really don't know why Yuan Shikai wanted them to do this. (131)</p>
<h3 id="e162">Ginkgo <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Summer quietly left, and autumn, autumn, sure enough, arrived slowly.</p>
<p>Fried ginkgo is soft and glutinous, come quickly to count the ginkgo to eat! Three cents for one, six cents for two, nine cents for three. If the flavor is not good, don't pay!</p>
<p>This familiar song coming from the mouth of the fried ginkgo seller, again riding the breeze from the street into my ear canal, alas! It's that time of year again! I couldn't help but hum sadly. At the same time, a memory flashed through my mind like a movie: it was this time last year, whenever this wonderful song floated in the air, my eight-year-old younger brother would clamor, "Buy, Mom, buy!" Mom would put down her needlework and instruct the nanny. And in an instant, I would see the nanny running in from outside with a small basket full of ginkgo in the crook of her arm. At that time, my little brother's eyes would smile into slits, his mouth would open as wide as a dipper, he would jump up and down, and his little hands would grab wildly in the basket.</p>
<p>Time has passed imperceptibly. And now, summer has quietly left, and autumn has returned to the world. That light, wonderful song is again blowing in the breeze. But, heavens! Where is my mother now? Where is my little brother? The changes in human affairs are truly so unpredictable! Last winter, my mother and little brother both contracted incurable diseases and left my father and me for another world. And now, although the song still wafts as it did in the past, who will I hear clamoring for Mom again? Where can I find Mom again?</p>
<p>A wave of intense sadness gnaws at my stomach. At this time, the song faintly rose again: "Fried ginkgo is soft and glutinous,..." I couldn't help but immediately cover my ears with my hands, I couldn't bear to listen anymore.</p>

<h3 id="e164">On Chinese Typesetting Fonts (Part 2) <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenlu</p>
<p>The Commercial Press followed closely, producing typefaces similar to the Song dynasty font, the main differences being in the variations at the beginning of strokes, and the reduced slant of horizontal strokes. They called it "Antique Type".</p>
<p>The Commercial Press also produced a True Script (Zhenshu, that is, regular script) typeface, which when printed, looks roughly like handwritten regular script. Although it tends to appear a little stiff.</p>
<p>However, the range of sizes for this typeface was too small (usually six sizes are needed, from the largest to the sixth), insufficient for practical use, and there were many missing characters. Common characters were not cast. Whenever a hundred-character text was set, it was often necessary to specially engrave a few characters of this style to fill in the gaps, and the engraved characters could not be harmonized and integrated with the cast type; a few engraved characters spoiled the overall aesthetic, a truly regrettable thing! A foreign firm called the Commercial Printing House also cast True Script type, suffering from similar problems to the above. But I have seen countless intellectuals in China, countless people advocating industrial development to save the nation, thousands of stores and tens of thousands of factories across the country engaged in the printing business in Shanghai, and rarely anyone is interested in doing this work of innovating Chinese typefaces. But some foreign merchants took the lead, doing it for us. I fear that the study of inscriptions and seals will also have no one to study in our country, and foreigners will go ahead with it. That day is right before us!</p>
<p>Speaking of inscriptions, six or seven years ago, there was Yi Dachang, a master of inscriptions, skilled in writing, and adept at Six Dynasties script. He established the Huanan Publishing House on Wangping Street, preparing to produce a Wei stele-style typeface, making a great contribution to the future of culture. He painstakingly, over many years, according to the number of characters sequentially listed in the typeface case, wrote the Wei stele-style characters, five sets from large size to size five (that is, five different sizes of characters). He entrusted a foundry to make copper molds and cast the type. After a long time, only a few Wei stele-style type were cast. I have seen small items such as name cards printed with that typeface, and they were truly beautiful and pleasing, surpassing the various styles of other products. This was mostly because the calligraphy was both good and neat. Unfortunately, the foundry was too slow in completing the work, with no prospect of completion in sight. The Huanan Publishing House could not wait long and later closed down. This undertaking, which was so important to the future of our country's industry and artistic glory, was thus lightly extinguished. Perhaps not many people know about this matter, but even today, people still feel sorry for it when it is mentioned!</p>
<p>The revolution of Chinese typefaces is as described above. The Wei stele-style typeface created by Mr. Yi is even more like a martyr who sacrificed blood and life. These things have aroused the attention and sympathy of society. Therefore, there are now companies casting and selling True Script typefaces, which are manufactured more completely than those mentioned above. Especially in the last year or two, many more stores have opened to cast and sell imitation Song dynasty typefaces. Typefaces in the imitation Song dynasty style have become increasingly popular, almost usurping the position of the old Song dynasty style. Look, in recent printed products, not to mention the single-sheet parts used for commercial and personnel applications, even those so-called cultural vanguard subscription books, periodicals, small newspapers, etc., all follow the convenience of their environment and try their best to use typefaces other than the old Song dynasty style, in order to suit the tastes of readers and increase the aesthetic value of their publications. In short, this change and proliferation of typefaces is a good thing, but whether a typeface is good or not, whether it is superior or not, is another matter. Whether the craftsmanship of the new typeface is successful or not is yet another matter. These should be distinguished and dealt with by printing craftsmen and the public. If a typeface is not good and is truly unacceptable, it should be discarded by all. If a typeface is good but is made too badly, it should be guided and urged to reform. Only then can Chinese typefaces evolve and reach the realm of art. If you don't believe me, just look at the imitation Song dynasty typefaces that were poorly copied before there were cast and sold. If you were to gather them together to set and print a document, what kind of feeling would you get from this so-called imitation Song dynasty typeface? As for me, even when I see items printed with the so-called imitation Song dynasty typefaces that are now being cast and sold, if they are fundamentally flawed in the typeface model (even in the writing), I deeply lament that such crude workmanship is a disgrace to the country!</p>

<h3 id="e165">International Football Association Officially Announces Three Changes to the Rules of Football <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Sports Advancement Association Releases Translation</p>
<p>Decided to Implement and Apply from This Year</p>
<p>The National Sports Advancement Association has received the official announcement from the International Football Association regarding three changes to the rules of football and has decided to implement and apply them from this year. It is hoped that all regions will pay attention. The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Clause 1 of Chapter 5, fourth sentence, is merely a correction of English wording and does not change the meaning of the text. The originally used Chinese translation is already consistent with the meaning of the change, namely: "The player throwing the ball shall not touch the ball again before another player has touched it."</p>
<p>(2) Clause 1 of Chapter 10, sixth sentence, the old rule: "After being replaced, the player should enter the field when the game is stopped, report to the referee again, and only after being qualified can they rejoin the game."</p>
<p>New rule: "A player who has left the field due to the above example or for other reasons, or a player who has arrived after the game has already started, should re-enter or join the game when the game is paused and must report to the referee."</p>
<p>For violations of this rule, the referee should have the following judgment (this is a refereeing law, not a rule, so it is not recorded in the rule book): "A player who re-enters or arrives late and does not report to the referee should be warned. If the player commits other rules, they should be punished according to the rules."</p>
<p>(3) Explanation of Chapter 13 (also not the text of the rules)</p>
<p>"If the game is stopped due to a player's improper behavior, regardless of whether the player is only warned or is sent off, the opposing team should be given a free kick to continue the game."</p>
<h3 id="e166">Swimming Competition: Guangdong vs. Western YMCA <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>丨Twenty-five to Thirty-five Points丨</p>
<p>Liu Baoxi Sets New Western YMCA Record</p>
<p>100-Yard Backstroke in One Minute, Fourteen and Four-Tenths Seconds</p>
<p>The Shanghai and Guangdong swimming teams, with the temporary participation of four outstanding Chinese swimmers from the Hong Kong Interport Team, held a swimming competition last night against the Western YMCA. The audience was quite large. As a result of the competition, Guangdong unfortunately lost to the Western YMCA by a margin of twenty-five to thirty-five points. However, the competitive situation was extremely tense. The two outstanding athletes, Guo Zhenheng and Liu Baoxi, maintained their championships in breaststroke and backstroke respectively. Liu Baoxi even broke the Western YMCA's four-year-old 100-yard backstroke record with a time of one minute, fourteen and five-tenths seconds, which is truly remarkable and brings honor to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>New Backstroke Record. The backstroke competitors were Liu Baoxi and Jian Erming for Guangdong, and Kai Neng and Mai Liesto for the Western YMCA. Liu took the lead all the way, and the championship was never in doubt. He finished fifteen yards ahead of the second place finisher, with a time of one minute, fourteen and five and two-tenths seconds, breaking the previous Western YMCA record of one minute, fourteen and five and four-tenths seconds set in 1931. The Western YMCA record is held by a Chinese. Last autumn, Guo Zhenheng established a record of two minutes, forty-five and five-thirds seconds in the 200-yard breaststroke. Now Liu follows in Guo's footsteps, becoming the second person to do so. Last night, Jian Erming trailed Liu closely, ranking second. However, in the last twenty-five yards, he was overtaken by Mai Liesto due to lack of strength, finishing a hand's breadth behind in third place.</p>
<p>Breaststroke and Relay. Guo Zhenheng's first place in the 200-yard breaststroke was without question. However, there was an unexpected turn of events. Jian Erjie actually took the lead before Guo in the first eighty yards. The two Westerners lagged far behind. At eighty yards, Guo Zhenheng suddenly took the lead and won by a pool length to the finish, about twenty yards. Guo's time was two minutes, forty-five and five-thirds seconds, unfortunately short of his record of two minutes, forty-three and five-seconds set last year. The medley relay was easily won thanks to the efforts of the three major players, Guo, Liu, and Xu. However, in the 200-yard freestyle relay, they lost by an inch after fierce competition, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>Reasons for Defeat. The Guangdong team's defeat was due to the weakness in the two short-distance races and diving. The Western YMCA swept the top two places in the 50-yard race and diving. They only got second place in the 100-yard and 400-yard races. Therefore, even though they won in breaststroke and backstroke, it was ultimately to no avail. The results of the competition are as follows:</p>
<p>50-yard Freestyle: Glick (West), Smith (West), Zhou Ruiqin (Guangdong), 27 seconds.</p>
<p>100-yard Freestyle: Logan (West), Xu Heng (Guangdong), Staikowski (West), 61 seconds.</p>
<p>400-yard Freestyle: Logan (West), Xu Heng (Guangdong), Barrera (West), 5 minutes, 36 seconds.</p>
<p>100-yard Backstroke: Liu Baoxi (Guangdong), Mai Liesto (West), Jian Eryou (Guangdong), 1 minute, 14 seconds, 4 (New)</p>
<p>200-yard Breaststroke: Guo Zhenheng (Guangdong), Jian Erjie (Guangdong), Lan Gen (West), 2 minutes, 45 seconds, 6</p>
<p>Fancy Diving: Glick (West), Bock Xiu (West), Huang Xihan (Guangdong)</p>
<p>150-yard Medley Liu Baoxi Kai Neng</p>
<p>Three-Style Relay: Guangdong Guo Zhenheng Western YMCA Mai Liesto 1 minute, 36 seconds</p>
<p>Xu Heng Huat</p>
<p>Huat Xu Heng</p>
<p>200-yard Freestyle Relay: Western YMCA Smith Guangdong Zhou Ruiqin 1 minute, 51 seconds, 2</p>

<p>Intermediate Hurdles Break North China Record</p>
<p>Women's and Other Performances Mediocre</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) The provincial North China Preliminary Competition opened today (16th). The results for the whole day were mediocre, with no new records discovered. The men's advanced level, whether armed comrades, pistol brigades, or security teams, and especially the intermediate level, were in poor condition. Many did not meet the standard. Participating in North China with this level, there is probably not much confidence. Among the advanced level athletes, Qiu Zongcheng, who had participated in the Far East Games, achieved a time of 4 minutes and 25 seconds and 7 tenths of a second in the 1500 meters this afternoon, and the 800-meter time of Jia Lianren was 2 minutes and 8 seconds and 8 tenths of a second, which are relatively impressive. In the intermediate level, only Li Houda's 110-foot high hurdles time reached 17 seconds and 4 tenths of a second, breaking the North China record of 17 seconds. Everyone had high hopes for the women's results, but the results today showed that Zhu Tianzhen's high jump result fell to 1 meter 24, Wang Fengjie's 50-meter time was 7 seconds and 6 tenths of a second, Yu Xiulan's 100-meter time was 14 seconds and 2 tenths of a second, and Yin Sugui's 80-meter low hurdles time was 16 seconds, which are still quite impressive. However, with the rapid progress of women's results in Qingdao and Henan, and with strong opponents ahead, it remains to be seen whether this year's North China Women's Track and Field Championship can still be maintained by Shandong. There were four registrants for the all-around decathlon, but only Bao Jiarui participated, and he also stopped halfway, so there were no results. The full-day track and field final results are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Women's Division: 50-meter final, Wang Fengjie (Individual) 7 seconds, 6 tenths, Liang Zhongguang (Girls' Middle School) 7 seconds, 7 tenths, Wang Jingfan (Girls' Middle School) 7 seconds, 8 tenths. All three qualified.</p>
<p>100-meter final, Yu Xiulan (4th Normal School) 14 seconds, 2 tenths, Liang Guang (Girls' Middle School), Wang Jingfan (Girls' Middle School). All three qualified.</p>
<p>Shot Put (8 lbs) final, Ding Guimei (Zhifu) 8 meters 75, Yang Cuifang (Women's Vocational), Zhang Shufang (Girls' Middle School). The top two qualified.</p>
<p>Long Jump, final, Xu Jun (Girls' Middle School) 4 meters 09, Hu Suzhi (Zhifu), Han Fukun (Women's Shandong). All did not qualify.</p>
<p>80-meter Low Hurdles final, Yin Suogui (4th Normal School) 16 seconds, 1 tenths. Qualified.</p>

<p>Men's Advanced Level: 1500-meter final, Qiu Zongcheng (Security 4) 4 minutes 25 seconds, 7 tenths, Niu Hongquan (Individual, Chen Yuqi (Security 1)). All three qualified.</p>
<p>110-meter High Hurdles final, Chuan Zhishi (Yiwen) 18 seconds 4, Wang Jiayu (Medical School). The first one qualified.</p>
<p>Discus final, Wang Fengren (Qilu University) 29 feet 24, Sun Zhifa (Jingcheng), Ma Hongxiang (Individual). All did not qualify.</p>

<p>German Sports Circles Express Hope</p>
<p>(Havas News Agency, Berlin, 17th) The Jewish people will be prohibited from participating in the 1936 Olympic Games held in Berlin. The United States has expressed opposition to this discrimination. The Chairman of the Olympic Committee of that country, Byron Tai Ji, recently said that he is not yet sure whether the United States will participate in the Games. German sports figures originally believed that the discriminatory measures against the Jews would not be implemented, so that the United States could join. Therefore, they were extremely disappointed to hear Bai's declaration.</p>

<p>The Talk of Being Director of the Tennis Department Is Groundless</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that Qiu Feihai was one of the initiators of the Meiyuan Gymnasium and that he would be the director of the gymnasium's tennis department. Now we have received a letter from Mr. Qiu denying this. The original letter is attached below to clarify the truth (the above is omitted):</p>
<p>This morning I read your newspaper and saw in the sports news column that I and Mr. Scotten raised funds to build the Meiyuan Gymnasium and that I was appointed as the director of the gymnasium's tennis department. After reading it, I was very surprised. I have never met Mr. Scotten before, and I was not consulted beforehand about the establishment of the gymnasium. Only last month did Mr. Shi visit and consult with me, proposing that all competitions of the Shanghai Tennis Association, which I run, be held at the gymnasium during the season. It is still unclear whether this matter will proceed. Now it is suddenly said that I am the initiator of the association. I think it is a misunderstanding of the rumors. I am sending this letter to clarify and request that you correct it on my behalf. I would be very grateful. Qiu Feihai respectfully (September 18th)</p>

<p>Dajiaolian's Sorrowful Declaration</p>
<p>Lost Territory Unrecovered, Great Hatred Unresolved</p>
<p>National Rights Unrevitalized, Resistance Unceasing</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third anniversary of September 18th. The United Association of Teachers and Staff of Shanghai Universities issued the following painful declaration: All compatriots across the country, please take note. What day is today? Is it not the day three years ago when the violent Japanese forcibly occupied our Shenyang, invaded our Northeast, burned and killed our people, and plundered our property? Is it not the most heartbreaking and shameful day that the violent Japanese trampled on our sovereignty and insulted our nation? Today, it has been three years. The white mountains and black waters have all fallen into a state of lawlessness. The north of the Great Wall and the south of the mouth are almost all colonial lands. Alas, compatriots, the Japanese imperialists are extremely vicious and ruthless, unprecedented. They take an inch and want a mile. They make endless demands. It seems that they will sweep across China, the map will change color, and the exploitation and oppression will be so severe that the people will have nothing left to eat. The blood of Goryeo still exists, and the ashes of Taiwan remain. Are our compatriots willing to sit idly by and be slaughtered by others? Alas, compatriots, the enemy is deep, the country is in danger. We should harbor the ambition to govern Wu early, like Goujian who slept on brushwood and tasted gall. We should quickly recover the hatred of the lost territory by recuperating and training. Farmers prepare food, workers make tools, merchants sell goods in the market, and soldiers and police deploy defenses in the field. All take that violent Japanese as our only great enemy and strive to resist humiliation. We colleagues in the academic and cultural circles should especially be determined to become strong, promote the theory of anti-Japanese resistance, instill the concept of anti-Japanese resistance, study specialized anti-Japanese academics, and practice the spirit of self-salvation in anti-Japanese resistance. We should work day and night, constantly thinking of this matter. Lost territory unrecovered, great hatred unresolved, national rights unrevitalized, resistance unceasing. The day our Chinese nation is completely independent will be the time for Sino-Japanese friendship and international peace. Alas, compatriots, the eight hundred followers of Tian Heng left their loyalty to the ages, and Shao Kang's one brigade left its glorious name to the ages. Although that violent Japanese is strong, what is there to fear? The wind and rain are as dark as night, but the rooster crows endlessly. We are willing to rise up with our compatriots across the country to plan for this.</p>

<p>Vocational Education in the Five Provinces of Ping, Ji, Lu, E, and Gan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent a large number of members to inspect education in various provinces and cities, mostly for general inspections. For specialized inspections of vocational education, only Director Gu Shusen was sent to inspect vocational education in Zhejiang Province in the first half of this year (Gu was busy with matters in the department and could not make the trip before the summer vacation. There was a plan to go after the autumn, but no decision has been made yet). Inspector Gu Zhaoyan inspected vocational education in Henan and Hunan. Inspector and Section Chief Zhong Daozan inspected vocational education in Jiangsu and Anhui. (The reports of vocational education inspections in these four provinces by Zhong and Gu were published by the Ministry of Education.) In order to understand and promote the vocational education situation in the remaining provinces and cities in order to meet the standards set by the ministry, the Ministry still intends to continue sending staff to inspect. It has been heard that the Ministry of Education has sent Inspector Gu Zhaoyan and Inspector and Section Chief Zhong Daozan to inspect vocational education in the five provinces of Peiping, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangxi, and Hubei. Around the end of this month, they will temporarily negotiate which provinces each person will be responsible for and set out to inspect.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Recent Situation of National Chiao Tung University <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Zhaohuan, President of National Chiao Tung University, has recently been following the government's explicit instructions to raise standards and enrich content. Therefore, improvements in curriculum, equipment of mechanical instruments, addition of books, and expansion of various laboratories have been vigorously pursued, despite a reduction of more than 40,000 yuan in annual funding. A reporter recently interviewed officials of the university. The following is a record of the recent developments at the university.</p>
<p>(1) Graduated Students: The total number of graduates from the Shanghai main campus and the two colleges in Peiping and Tangshan was more than 230. In addition to more than ten students who have been admitted with government funding to study abroad through Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Northeast, Tsinghua, and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee, about 20 others went abroad at their own expense. (This is the largest number of students studying abroad in the university's history.) As for the other graduates, in addition to those who had been pre-arranged for positions in construction organizations, banks, factories, and companies in various provinces and cities, the majority went to various railways in the country for internships. It is said that the initial trial results of the graduates from the two new departments of architecture and hydraulic engineering added in recent years to the Tangshan Engineering College, and the road engineering department added to the Shanghai main campus's Land and Civil Engineering College are all excellent.</p>
<p>(2) New Students This Year: In the two enrollment examinations for new students this year, there were more than 2,000 applicants from various regions. Because the university was ordered by the government to raise standards, the selection criteria were revised. Furthermore, the university has a fixed quota for each new student intake. Although there were qualified applicants in this year's enrollment, only a limited number were admitted due to the quota. Only 180 students were admitted to the various colleges of the Shanghai main campus, about 70 students were admitted to the civil engineering and mining and metallurgy departments of Tangshan, and about 35 students were admitted to the railway management department of Peiping. On average, one out of every seven applicants was admitted. The grades of each department were better than last year, indicating that the management of secondary schools in various regions has also improved. New students have now paid their fees and enrolled. The university held a welcome tea party for new students in the gymnasium the other day. The president, provost, deans of various colleges, dean of students, and dean of academic affairs all gave earnest speeches.</p>
<p>(3) Various Facilities: This year, the various colleges of the Shanghai main campus have seen considerable development. For example, the College of Management has added fourth-year classes in finance, railways, public affairs, and industry, and has also established a rolling stock laboratory, collecting various domestic and foreign rolling stock materials and statistics for students to practice. Furthermore, the College of Science has added a metallurgy department and newly established a special chemical laboratory, an optical electromagnetic laboratory, an industrial analysis laboratory, and an industrial chemistry laboratory, all of which have been fully equipped. The Tangshan metallurgy laboratory is under construction and is expected to be completed after autumn. As for the various engineering colleges, there are plans to add departments such as automotive engineering, aeronautical engineering, refrigeration engineering, textile engineering, electrical lighting engineering, and power communication. If funding is available, these departments can be established in sequence.</p>
<p>(4) Newly Hired Faculty: This year, most of the faculty members of the various colleges remain the same. Physics lecturer Mr. Mai Cunjian has taken leave to work as a mechanic on the Ping Sui Railway. Chemistry professor Dr. Shen Zhennan has taken a year's leave to go south to Guangxi Province to set up a sugar factory at the special invitation of the Guangxi Provincial Government. Transportation professor Dr. Zhou Fengtu has also taken a year's leave to handle joint transportation business at the special request of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Due to the addition of various subjects in the College of Management and the College of Science, new professors have been hired, including Dr. Lin Die, former lecturer at New York University; Dr. Li Binghua, former professor at Yenching University; CPA Yu Xiji, former director of the Ministry of Finance; Dr. Xia Lai Lin, former president of Millard Academy; Gu Chengjun, former president of Peiping Women's College of Arts and Sciences; Tang Yan Yi, former director of the mathematics department of Jinan University; Dr. Ding Sixian, former dean of academic affairs of Anhui University, and other lecturers. Several new faculty members have also been hired at Tangshan College due to the addition of a fourth-year class in the mining and metallurgy department, such as Dr. Wang Junhao from the mining and metallurgy college of Columbia University, who is currently working in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(5) Rebuilding the Library Stacks: The university library has a large collection of Chinese and foreign books. The existing library building is insufficient, and the beams and columns are slightly skewed due to the heavy pressure of the books. For safety reasons, the addition of library stacks cannot be delayed. However, due to the high cost and limited university funds, it is impossible to cope. Former President Tang Wenzhi and others have launched a fundraising campaign among alumni and enthusiastic educators in various regions to remedy the situation. The reporter also interviewed a gentleman from the university's engineering department, who said that the buildings in the upper and middle courtyards are also quite dilapidated due to their age and must be rebuilt. However, since the private Nanyang Model Middle School occupies the south courtyard, even if minor repairs are made, there are no suitable buildings available for relocation, and the required expenses are very large and difficult to raise. University officials are deeply troubled by this.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Dissent on "Creation and Time" <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Shui</p>
<p>(The completion of a great work requires a considerable amount of time. This is an undeniable fact in history.) Mr. Huang Huaibai told us this. He (casually cited a few examples), namely Goethe, Milton, and Byron.</p>
<p>History is accustomed to playing tricks on people. Mr. Huang cited examples that could prove his theory, but we can also cite examples to the contrary, right there in Mr. Huang's (history) book.</p>
<p>Starting from ancient times, the three tragedians of Greece cannot but be said to be great, right? Aeschylus lived to be sixty-nine years old (approximately) and wrote more than eighty tragedies; Sophocles lived to be ninety years old (approximately) and wrote about ninety tragedies (or perhaps one hundred and twenty-three); Euripides lived to be seventy-five years old and also wrote about a hundred plays. These three great tragedians cannot but be said to be (prolific), right? However, this did not prevent them from being (great).</p>
<p>But Greece is ultimately too ancient. Greek (history) is somewhat (mythical) and cannot be considered good evidence. We must cite more reliable (history). Then, Sir Walter Scott began writing novels in 1814 and, by 1829, with "Anne of Geierstein," he had written about 150,000 words of novels in twenty-one volumes over fifteen years. This can be said to be the first (prolific) record (in history), but the title of (great) did not escape from Sir Walter Scott. Alexandre Dumas's literary career began with the historical drama "Henry III" in February 1829. The novel "The Three Musketeers" was published in 1844, and the following year, the (sequel), "Twenty Years After," was published. Even if we say that Alexandre Dumas was preparing (historical novels) as early as 1839, then even including the time spent collecting materials, it would only be about five or six years before he wrote two (great works). Furthermore, looking at his (productive heyday), from 1842 to 1846, he completed two (trilogies) in just four years, and these two (trilogies) are precisely his most (great) works.</p>
<p>In addition, if we were to allocate time to Balzac, Tolstoy, or Zola, Mr. Huang Huaibai would feel that it was (too casual). However, Balzac and the others are still (great).</p>
<p>It can be seen that the issue of (creation and time) cannot be viewed rigidly. Even with the example cited by Mr. Huang Huaibai himself, Goethe's "Faust," Mr. Huang said that he (spent a full fifty years, from the age of twenty-three to eighty-three, to complete this masterpiece). However, in my opinion, these (fifty years) are worth studying. When we read Goethe's biography, we know that he was not exclusively working on "Faust" during those (fifty years). A writer may take many years from the initial idea of writing a book to its completion. Goethe is not the only one in (history) to have done so. However, we cannot rigidly say how many years it took to write that book.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang's advice to current writers not to produce shoddy work is correct. However, the basis of his argument is built on sand. If a writer does not have rich life experience, meticulous and sharp observation, and a systematic and mature way of thinking, then even if he (cherishes time) and spends ten years writing a sentence, it may not necessarily be a (great) work. Mr. Huang sets aside the writer's life experience and so on and only makes judgments based on the rigid relationship between (creation and time), citing Goethe and Milton as examples. This is difficult to convince current writers. Or is Mr. Huang's so-called (requiring a considerable amount of time) referring to the acquisition of rich life experience, the development of meticulous and sharp observation, and the maturation of thought? If so, then Mr. Huang's examples are not applicable. Judging from the examples cited by Mr. Huang and his criticisms of current writers, it must be said that his concept is limited to a rigid temporal relationship.

<h3 id="e188">On Mr. Mu Shiying's "(On Sorrow)" <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Dihe</p>
<p>Mr. Mu Shiying said in Free Talk "(On Sorrow)":</p>
<p>(In our literature, sorrow is two words that are loved by people: and the emotion of sorrow is also very easily popular among young people. The lyrics of Li Houzhu, Li Qingzhao, and Nalan Chengde, and the poems of Li Yishan are sold in various versions in the market; some novels shrouded in cheap sentimentalism, such as "The Sorrows of Young Werther," "Downfall," "Lost Lamb," "Immensee," "La Dame aux Camélias," and even "A Smile in a Dream," which completely imitates "Immensee," are cherished by the broad masses; the tone of "Oh, sorrow" permeates the conversations and correspondence of young people; a gloomy face is regarded as the temperament of a poet; these are all readily available examples.)</p>
<p>However, his view is incorrect; such a thing once happened: an author, in a certain time and under certain circumstances, used sorrow and tears to complete his artwork; readers in a certain place would also regard this artwork as a precious treasure; however, when the time and place change, the author's emotions and the readers' tastes will be completely different; therefore, the (masses) who currently regard "Immensee" and the like as treasures, and the (young people) whose tone is filled with (Oh, sorrow), will probably be regarded as waste by another kind of young people and the masses.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Mr. Village Chief (5) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>From the drawer of the black and sour account table, a notice was taken out and unfolded to take a look. It was written like this:</p>
<p>(······</p>
<p>((1) The purpose of organizing reserve soldiers this time is to train your ability to defend yourselves, not to call you to join the army. You must all abide by the law and act accordingly.</p>
<p>((2) The training period for each term is stipulated to be two months. During this month, the county will subsidize food expenses. The cost of clothing and other expenses will also be provided by the county. After the expiration of the term, you will still be allowed to return to your villages.</p>
<p>((3) The total number of people in the first phase is 50, which will be drawn in proportion to the number of able-bodied men in each village.······</p>
<p>((4) ······</p>
<p>(In summary, you must all abide by the above provisions. Otherwise, severe punishment will be inflicted without pardon······)</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Wen recognized it for a while and handed it to Crippled Ke Sheng.</p>
<p>(What exactly does this say?) Crippled Ke Sheng still unfolded the notice without putting it away. (People in the village say that it is drawing conscripts. With this kind of drawing method, I am afraid that no one will go.)</p>
<p>(You are really a fool!) Mr. Feng Wen felt that he should lose his temper this time. (I have told you so many times, it is not drawing conscripts, it is training reserve soldiers! However, the age is limited to over 20 and under 40! Moreover, you will come back after two months of training!)</p>
<p>(Oh, oh!) Winter Sheng, who was not very patient originally, has now learned to be very amiable. (Are you going to learn to drill? Will you really be released after learning to drill for two months?)</p>
<p>(Of course! The county magistrate has told me personally, and the district chief has also told me personally, but you still won't rely on you.)</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Wen sat down on the bamboo chair with a thud. The bamboo chair made a gurgling sound as if it were suffering for someone else.</p>

<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>(Grandma. Mommy is asleep.)</p>
<p>Running over with a patter, while talking, Xiao Lan walked to her grandmother's side. The old woman Huang grabbed her good hand, wanting to ask her something, but suddenly felt something cool on her hand. Looking down, tears were flowing from the child's face. She couldn't help but panic and asked:</p>
<p>(Why are you crying, Xiao Lan?)</p>
<p>The child did not make a sound, but just shook her head.</p>
<p>(Did Mom hit you?)</p>
<p>(Mom didn't.)</p>
<p>(Then what's wrong with you?)</p>
<p>(I don't know what's wrong, I see Mom crying, and I cried too. Mom showed me Dad's picture, and I thought of Dad, and I couldn't stop crying.)</p>
<p>The old woman Huang comforted her granddaughter while pulling her hand to the outer room.</p>
<p>The daughter-in-law's room was dark, the light was turned off. The old woman Huang groped her way to the door and heard sobbing inside. The child shouted:</p>
<p>(Mom, Grandma is here.)</p>
<p>The old woman Huang felt a pang of heartache, and tears fell like rain. She grabbed the door frame with one hand, preventing herself from falling, and said tremblingly:</p>
<p>(Daughter-in-law, you, ······ you ······ you are crying?)</p>
<p>The daughter-in-law did not answer. She was lying on the kang, quietly moved her body, turned on the light, and got off the kang. A large area of the kang mat was stained with tears. Taking the child's hand, she said in a low voice:</p>
<p>(Grandma, sit for a while.)</p>
<p>After settling down, the old woman Huang asked:</p>
<p>(Tomorrow is the third anniversary, the third anniversary of Xiao Lan's father, but have you remembered it too? I was just about to tell you.)</p>
<p>(Alright, Grandma, don't think about these things, it's useless to think about them, you can't bring them back to life.)</p>
<p>(Are you comforting me? Why are you still crying?)</p>
<p>(I'm not like you.)</p>
<p>(I feel like I've suffered more pain than you. To tell you the truth: the eldest died, the second ran away, I have to live my life, and I'm always sad for you. Why is my life so bad, ······)</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the old woman Huang was filled with grief and could no longer continue her words. She just stared blankly at the small, bean-sized light. The daughter-in-law and child both focused their eyes on a photo of a man in military uniform.</p>
<p>The countryside on an autumn night is quiet and solemn. Encountering these turbulent times, no one travels at night, and even a few barks of dogs cannot evoke any associations. Only the chirping and chirping autumn insects call out, decorating this silent night, but in fact, it is better to say that they are lamenting the imminent end of life, singing sad songs for themselves. The strong scent of grain is released day and night, as if telling people that they have completed their mission. The dark sky covers the dark earth. This human world seems to be just struggling in the darkness.</p>
<p>The old woman Huang looked at the light, and suddenly a burst of dizziness in front of her eyes made her see a night in Changchun three years ago, the night her eldest son died. She saw how her son was beaten to death by Japanese soldiers, and many soldiers also lost their lives. Fire and shelling destroyed the entire barracks. She also saw her second son, who acted almost like a bandit, together with people carrying guns, calling themselves Red Beards, and shouting that they were the Volunteer Army, dedicated to fighting the Japanese soldiers and fighting them to the death······</p>
<p>The old woman Huang also remembered the situation of being bullied by the officials in the past three years: since the death of her eldest son, there were no servants in the family, and the police in the district no longer looked at her with such high regard as before. Every time taxes were apportioned, they would definitely apportion more than others. Also, the self-defense corps often came to demand people, demanding her second son, saying that he had joined a bandit gang and harmed the local area. Every time they came, they had to be tipped off more or less. These things, inside and outside, made the old woman Huang feel that the world was becoming too out of shape, and people's hearts were becoming too evil.</p>
<p>(Mom, will Dad really never come back?)</p>
<p>After being dazed for a while, Xiao Lan suddenly said a sentence. The old woman Huang blinked her eyes. She said with a sentimental and indignant tone:</p>
<p>(Xiao Lan, your dad was killed by Japanese soldiers, how can he come back? Alas! A pitiful death. But don't forget this, and take revenge for your dad in the future! Alas! Why did he die, was it his fate to die! Why doesn't fate help people!)</p>
<p>(I heard that many people died that time,) the daughter-in-law said, moving her eyes from the photo to her mother-in-law's face, (Grandma, you always believe in bad fate, but does that mean that all those who died had bad fate? I don't believe in such things!)</p>
<p>The old woman Huang could not answer her daughter-in-law's words. She had encountered this situation more than once, but this time she was still the same as before, not angry, nor showing any embarrassment. After a while, she changed the subject and said:</p>
<p>(Aren't we going to the grave tomorrow? Then, we need to fold paper ingots.)</p>
<p>Xiao Ju interjected and said:</p>
<p>(I want to fold gold ingots for Dad, fold a big, yellow gold ingot.)</p>
<p>(Burning paper and money, I don't really believe in these things, and I don't have the mood to do it. I just hope that someone can drive the Japanese soldiers out, and I'll fold paper ingots every day and burn incense every night. But it's the third anniversary, and in these three years, I haven't heard of many troops fighting the Japanese soldiers! Our people died in vain, and no one has been given a chance to avenge them.)</p>
<p>Although she said so, she still squatted down and took out the paper foil from the cabinet with her right hand.</p>
<p>Xiao Lan shouted again, as if very happy:</p>
<p>(I want to fold gold ingots for Dad, fold a big, yellow gold ingot.)</p>
<p>The old woman Huang saw her daughter-in-law crying again. She felt very sad, and reached out several times before she could grab two gold foils, finally, she also cried.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Gold and Foreign Exchange Pressures Lead to Another $2.20 Drop in Premium <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Both New and Old Contracts Retreat Below $50</p>
<p>September Contracts Completely Liquidated</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market continued to weaken. Banks were eager to sell, resulting in numerous sellers in the market, pushing prices below the $50 threshold. The morning began with overseas silver markets showing a slight contraction in the UK and stability in the US. London spot gold rose by half a penny. Exchange rates were flat, US cotton rose by thirteen points, US wheat rose by one point, and stocks fell slightly. In off-market pre-trading, prices initially rose by over two dollars, but after a large transaction at the close, rumors of US buying activity emerged, and sellers became active, creating a very flat market. The opening saw a slight increase, but banks immediately put pressure on the market, hardening exchange rates and breaking through the $50 mark. However, due to prior knowledge that the HSBC exchange rates for both British and American currencies would remain unchanged, there were many buyers at the lower prices, leading to a rebound. At this point, the market struggled around the $50 level. Slightly negative rumors spread, and the banks' appetite for supply exceeded demand, leading to an oversupply in the domestic market, causing speculators to sell off. Another round of declines began, with active trading between banks and some opportunistic buying at cheaper prices. After the lows, the market entered a prolonged period of stagnation. Finally, as the foreign exchange market stabilized, scattered small investors showed some buying interest, but trading was limited, and the price briefly rose above $50. However, the ample supply then pushed it back below $50 by midday. The underlying trend remained stable, and the aftermarket opened steadily. Subsequently, the domestic market loosened again, and initial reports from Bombay indicated a rise of 1.2.2 annas followed by a decline. However, opportunistic buyers emerged, stabilizing sentiment. The supply side lacked continuity, and the market eventually settled into a flat pattern. The second report from Bombay showed a contraction of 1.1.1 annas. The gold market has entered a period of mediocrity. The December new standard also declined, but the overall day's trend remained relatively stable. The day's market conditions were primarily influenced by the pressure from the foreign exchange market, resulting in a downward trend. Trading within the market was quiet, making it difficult to initiate changes. Here is the day's market log:</p>
<p>The morning opened at $951.60, slightly higher by $0.40 compared to the previous close. The foreign exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of one shilling and five pence for British currency and $35.50 for American currency. HSBC immediately suppressed the October British gold at 0.0625, and Yuanmao, Yongcui, Tai, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Fuan, Ruixing, Yifeng, Yongzhao, and Fengchang all sold, pushing the price down to $49.20. Huabi purchased the December American gold at 75, while Qingyu, Yuanchang, Yongyuan, Chunchun, Yuanyong, and others jointly bought. With advance knowledge that HSBC's British and American exchange rates would remain unchanged, the price gradually recovered to $0.30. Shenkang, Zhaofengchang, Dadecheng, Shunli, Yuqing, and Yong still showed selling interest. Da Ying released the November American gold at 0.6875, and Huabi released the October American gold at 0.625, causing a drop to $48.30. Zhengjin purchased the January American gold at 0.8125. Yongli, Daxing, Yongchang, Shengyong, Yuanyuan, Fengyong, and Wanxing took advantage of the low prices to buy, pushing the price up to $9.30. Hengyu and Richang still provided supply. Da Ying released the November and December British gold at 125, and suppressed the December American gold at 75, dropping the price to $8.70. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and scattered investors all covered their positions, gradually recovering. Changsheng, Yongfu, and Yu bought, pushing the price up to $50.30. However, Fuyu, Fuxing, Yongda, and Dadecheng sold, pushing the price back down to $49.40. After fluctuating, the midday close was $949.80.</p>
<p>The aftermarket opened at $949.90. Dekang, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Yongli, Fuan, Yuanmao, and Yong sold. Huabi and HSBC released the October American gold at 0.0625, pushing the price down to $9.10. Hongxing and Yuanxing still bought, raising the price to $9.40. The report from Bombay indicated a rise of 1.2.2 annas, leading to some selling pressure. Hengchang and Yong sold off, dropping the price to $8.70. Huabi also released the November American gold at 0.6875. Maijiari bought eleven.</p>
<p>The price then rose to $9.40. Qianchang, Xiang, Fuxing, and Yong took the opportunity to supply. After fluctuating, the closing price was $949. Throughout the day, the highest price was $951.60, and the lowest price was $948.30, a fluctuation of $3.30. As a result, the price decreased by $2.20 compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on HSBC's American exchange rate, which remained unchanged at $35.25, resulting in a premium of $981. According to the closing price, the margin requirement was approximately $32, an increase of $2 compared to the previous close. The December new standard, due to the Central Bank's listing of customs gold units rising to 1933, resulted in a premium of $981. According to the closing price, the margin requirement was approximately $32, also an increase of $2 compared to the previous close. The registration price for this month was $950, the same price for October, November, and December. The morning water supplement was $950, and the afternoon water supplement was $949. The price of pure gold was still calculated at an additional $10, with a listed price of $961.60. There was a lack of trading in the market. Tianjin goods were priced at an additional $12.50, while spot prices required an additional $15, but there was still a lack of trading. Three to four thousand taels of eastern goods arrived in port yesterday, but only a small amount was purchased by the Central Bank at the flat premium price. As a result, it was difficult to complete transactions, and spot firms sought alternative sales channels. Only 294 contracts remained for this month, and 3,507 contracts remained for October, totaling eleven long positions and eighteen short positions.</p>
<p>Trading within the market remained light. In summary, Tianfeng, Yifeng, Yonghong, Xing, Tongchun, Dafa, Yongfu, Yu, Ruikang, Chunyuan, and Yongyuanchun were among the buyers, while Fuan, Dadecheng, Fuchang, Fuchun, Heng, Richang, Hongli, Shenkang, Qianchang, Xiang, Cuitai, and others were among the sellers. Shunli, Yuanchang, Yongfuxing, Yong were advanced and then exited. Dalian's Wanxing traded less than 400 contracts, netting out dozens of contracts. Shunli traded a total of over 500 contracts, netting in dozens of contracts. The Guangbang's Shengda and Hengxing had few transactions. The November chip count was 23,695, totaling 43 long positions and 51 short positions. The total number of transactions on the day was only 18,907 in the morning and 7,329 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The December new contracts opened at $951.20, up $0.30 from the previous close, which was somewhat related to the slight increase in customs gold. However, after the opening, market sentiment suddenly weakened, falling to $49.10. Although there was a slight rebound after entering, it was difficult to sustain, and the price further fell to $8.10. The midday close was $949.50. The aftermarket opened at $949.50 and then saw a low price of $8.40 again. Finally, there was not much change, and the closing price was $948.60. Throughout the day, the highest price was $951.20, and the lowest price was $48.10, a difference of $3.10. As a result, the price fell by $2.30 compared to the previous close. The chip count for December was 315, totaling 4 long positions and 3 short positions.</p>
<p>Regarding public contracts (on the day), Fuchang cleared out 224 contracts, and Dafengheng cleared 70 contracts. Yifengyong cleared in 91 contracts, Fuyu 84 contracts, Dadecheng 63 contracts, Yingfengheng 28 contracts, Shenkang 14 contracts, and Dachangxiang Yuanmao Yong 7 contracts each. A total of 194 contracts were cleared in. The remaining September contracts have now been completely liquidated.</p>

The British pound fell 25 against the US dollar, and the US dollar remained unchanged against the British pound. The British pound fell six points against the French franc, and the US dollar rose 25 against the French franc. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices of one shilling and five pence for the British currency and $35.50 for the American currency, with not much difference from the previous close. After the opening, banks immediately sold British gold, easing the market. HSBC announced its listed prices, with both British and American currencies flat. Banks opportunistically bought at cheaper prices, and there was still fluctuation. Soon after, banks showed selling interest again, and both British and American exchange rates simultaneously hardened. Chinese merchants still showed buying interest and were able to support the market. Midway through, trading between banks became active, so the domestic market eventually became flat again. The gold market was slightly stable. At midday, the overall trend was still flat. The aftermarket opened flat due to mutual trading between banks. After entering, banks again sold British gold, easing the market. Bombay rose 1.2 annas and eased the market. Chinese merchants slightly bought American dollars, and Korean Citibank repurchased shillings. Bombay returned a small amount of one anna, and the market was still flat after easing.

<p>Chinese Customs: Every time a festival approaches, it is customary to give gifts to relatives and friends. Now that the Mid-Autumn Festival is only a few days away, social customs remain unchanged, causing the financial market to tighten suddenly. Although the interbank lending rate is still at 1.5%, the "dividing the head" and adding water has increased dramatically due to the need for foreign currency, reaching a maximum of 7 points. Later, as head positions were able to be met, it fell to 5 points, but it was still double what it was the previous day.

The transaction price was 11,500 yuan in foreign currency, equivalent to 37,030 lü wen.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Securities and Bond Market Weaken Amidst Fluctuations <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation in the Chinese Securities Exchange was peaceful, with a slight weakening trend. Although the settlement period is getting closer and closer, both the long and short sides seemed to be quite leisurely. Generally, people are still looking for continued small increases, and the long side is still holding on, not wanting to show weakness. However, due to the settlement period, the actual strength of each side will be revealed within this short period of time. According to the current trend, it should be small at first and then large. Large fluctuations should occur after settlement. The process yesterday was entirely fluctuating and weakening, with each round only rising or falling by two or three jiao, and the trends were not consistent. They rose here and fell there, entirely due to the different timing of the long and short side swapping, resulting in uneven fluctuations. If large long position holders can receive the goods, then there should not be much fluctuation in the next few days. The market price results showed that they were mostly slightly weaker, ranging from one or two jiao to six or seven jiao. The total transaction volume was about 15 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (17th), the New York stock market initially declined, with some reaching the lowest records of the year. Towards the end, the market recovered, resulting in mixed results. Although commercial news was good, such as the increase in steel production, people were still pessimistic. Most speculators believed there was no danger of a major fall, but they appeared to be standing by, waiting for the market to be tested again. Silver stocks were quite strong, and United Metallurgical rose sharply by six yuan, as the prospects for the mining industry were relatively optimistic. The bond market was unchanged. US government bonds were mixed and slightly lower. The total daily transaction volume was 650,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>New Low Prices Emerge Continuously</p>
<p>The yarn market remains weak. Due to the poor environment, foreign firms are inclined to sell off, putting heavy pressure on the market. However, current yarn sales can still be maintained, but there is a relative shortage of those receiving yarn this month, making the market feel looser, so new lows are discovered every day.</p>

<p>The pre-market opening of the standard yarn had a relatively flat market sentiment. As US cotton rebounded by several points, market sentiment stabilized slightly. However, after the second and third rounds of auctions, due to the weakness of the cotton market, the market turned downwards again. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 jiao. In the afternoon opening, the long positions for the current month still had to be closed out, and the market situation fell again by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 jiao. At the closing auction, some profit takers covered their positions, rebounding by 0.4 and 0.5 jiao. As a result, the near-term months fell by 0.2 and 0.3 jiao, and the far-term months rose by 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 jiao. The total daily transaction volume was 41,400 bales. Jinchang sold 1,500 bales, Jifeng 800 bales, Tongji 800 bales, Daji 1,350 bales, Huikang 1,450 bales, Shenchang 600 bales, Feng 850 bales, Yichang 600 bales, Changfeng 750 bales, and Taichang 1,050 bales.

<p>The cotton market is gradually weakening. Because the yarn market is sluggish, current cotton mills are reluctant to buy. As for the American and Indian cotton markets, they are also softening. Therefore, sellers are calm. Another saying is that the Hancpu market price has news of easing, the weather has turned better, and there are more people expecting a smaller market.</p>

<p>The pre-market session of the standard cotton was relatively weak. Because the weather was clear, there were fewer buyers. The prices for each month fell by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao. The market was weaker in the afternoon opening. As current cotton business is bleak, the prices for October and November broke through the 4 yuan barrier. However, at the closing auction, those who made a profit covered their short positions, and the long side raised the prices again, and the prices rebounded by 0.1 to 0.15 jiao for each month. As a result, each month was flat. The total daily trading volume was 127,600 dan. Jifeng sold 1,400 dan, Gengfeng 3,500 dan, Dachang 4,200 dan, Xiesheng 1,500 dan, Hengyi 3,500 dan, Shenchang 2,700 dan, Shenji 4,500 dan, Renfeng 1,600 dan, Tongxing 1,300 dan, and Yuan Yi 1,300 dan, and Taichang 3,000 dan.

As a result, the spot price rose by 10 points, and the futures price rose by 9 to 13 points. English cotton futures fell by 12 points. Indian cotton softened due to large-scale speculative selling.

<p>After the morning opening of the flour market, prices for all months showed a consistent trend of stagnation. Although the quoted price for foreign wheat in Chicago was better by two to three dimes and Canadian wheat by one to three dimes, there was little activity at the opening due to slow sales in the north. In the Jiangzhe hinterland, mooncakes were already losing popularity, making sales even more difficult. Additionally, concerns about warehouse rent affected some forward contracts, causing near and distant prices to gradually decline, dropping by about one cent from the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the current month saw some profit-taking by outside speculators, while factory orders remained sluggish, leading to a gradual decline. There was little interest from customers in distant contracts, and prices also softened. As actual sales showed no improvement, the trend remained sluggish. Ultimately, the current month fell by two cents, October by one cent and seven and a half mills, November by two cents and two and a half mills, December and January by one cent and seven and a half mills, and February by one cent and a half.</p>
<p>After the morning opening of the wheat market, prices for all months generally remained stable. Although the quoted price for foreign wheat in Chicago was better by two to three dimes and Canadian wheat by one to three dimes, buyer interest was not strong at the opening, and sellers were also scarce. This resulted in a stalemate with no significant price movement. By the afternoon opening, influenced by the weakness in the flour market and the nearing delivery date for the current month, outside speculators slightly reduced their positions, causing market sentiment to turn weak. Distant contracts also saw some profit-taking, and opening prices declined. However, trading was very thin, and these fluctuations were indeed minimal. Ultimately, the current month was down by two small cents, October by three cents, November by five cents, December by four cents, and January by five cents. Spot wheat saw factory demand stall, and no new business was being conducted.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Slight Rebound in Su Tonghou's Japonica Rice <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) The various "gangs" (merchant groups) arriving mainly consisted of those labeled as numbers twelve and thirteen (with a total of nearly two thousand shi [unit of volume]), and market sentiment was relatively positive. Due to a perceived tight supply situation, the price of various grades of japonica rice saw a slight rebound of about a "jiao" (one-tenth of a yuan). However, spot sales of late-season rice from various "gangs" felt notably sluggish. Reliance was solely on bulk purchases, with the Qingdao and Yantai gangs stepping in to buy over five hundred packages. Market conditions remained stable but with a slightly tight undercurrent. However, given the stop-and-start nature of the buyer "gangs," future trends remain difficult to predict. Approaching the holiday season, financial constraints are keenly felt, making it difficult to achieve a favorable market situation before the holidays. The arrival of new japonica rice is gradually increasing, but sales are stagnant, leading to a drop of over two "chi" (unit of length, here likely referring to price). However, various grades of new "jian" rice are able to maintain supply and demand parity, with little price volatility. The same goes for "bian yuan" rice. Factories are only offering a new price of ten yuan and eight "jiao."</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the supply from various sources down the river (Jiangsu) were of the 14th and 15th grades. The market showed some improvement in clearing goods that were skillfully selected. The market price of white japonica rice was down by about one "jiao," and white "yuan" rice was down by nearly a "jiao." New "yang jian" rice was down by two "jiao," new and old "ke jian" rice was down by a few "fen" (one-hundredth of a yuan), western new japonica rice was down by more than a "chi," and eastern new japonica rice was down by two "jiao." Thin rice was scarce, with prices high and the market fatigued.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Revival of Sales of Zhangzhou Brown Rice <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign customer's "xian" rice (long-grain rice) remained fair and stable. The production price of foreign rice rose slightly, with hoarders reluctant to sell. Buyers were generally not very interested in purchasing, and the market turned quiet. There was only one transaction of 200 tons of small returned goods from March, priced at five yuan, one "jiao" and six "fen," which was up five to six "fen" from the previous week. There were no other transactions. The spot market for foreign rice still has a large inventory, but everyone is waiting and watching. The total market volume was only 1,433 packages, with prices similar to the previous market, but the situation showed a slight improvement. Customer's "xian" rice was very dull, while brown rice was selling well in the hinterland of this street. The Zhangzhou rice, which had previously caused disputes, has been proven to be a product of southern Fujian. However, due to being detained for several days, the price repeatedly dropped. Yesterday, a hinterland street purchased 3,000 packages of brown rice, and the price rose by five "fen" to a "jiao." There are still over 8,000 packages in the market, and there is hope for sales to improve in the coming days. All other brown rice and other rice varieties totaled less than 1,000 packages, and the market was generally stable.</p>
<h3 id="e208">New Peanuts Hit the Market <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>New peanuts and peanut kernels hit the market yesterday, but the quantity was still small. A total of 13 packages of peanuts and 11 packages of peanut kernels arrived, all shipped from Qingdao. The quality was good, and the harvest was also abundant, estimated to be around 70-80%. Peanuts were priced at seven yuan, and peanut kernels were priced at eleven yuan. These are the initial prices for the new crop and are not yet definitive. Sales were made to retail shops on this street. The soybean market remained weak and fatigued, with new soybeans continuing to fall by three to four "fen." Over 270 packages of "Kaichengmen" soybeans were priced at three yuan, seven "jiao" to six "jiao" and eight "fen." Early yellow soybeans sold at six to seven hundred packages, priced at three yuan, four "jiao" and seven "fen" to four "jiao" and a half for golden skin beans, and four "jiao" to three "jiao" and three "fen" for white skin beans. Furthermore, new soybeans from Xinpu also entered the market, totaling 59 packages, priced at three yuan and two "jiao." Old soybeans were high-priced, fatigued, and mediocre. The reason was weak demand for high-priced goods, while goods from the central ports to Tongzhou continued to be purchased, causing market sentiment to turn stable. One cart of Zhengyangguan soybeans was priced at three yuan and one "jiao," one cart of Qin Island soybeans was priced at three yuan, one cart of Linhuaiguan soybeans was priced at two yuan and seven "jiao" and four "fen," one cart of Chuzhou soybeans was priced at two yuan and nine "jiao," and five carts of Yingzhou soybeans were priced from two yuan, eight "jiao" and seven "fen" to eight "jiao."</p>

<p>The first batch of new Quanzhou bubble candies arrived yesterday afternoon on the Huaping Wheel, totaling 3,000 boxes. It is said that some of them will be transferred to other ports. According to information from the cargo agent, the supply of major ingredients is not large this time, and the purchase price is relatively high. However, given the situation in Shanghai, it is difficult to obtain a good price. Therefore, selling at market prices will inevitably lead to losses.</p>

<p>Sales of green tea from Luzhuang Pingshui and Tuzhuang have been sluggish recently, and the situation is worsening. Yesterday, only Baochang, Yongxing, and Tianxiang companies showed some interest in "Chouxin Zhenmei" green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi. The top price offered was 140 yuan, and the market price was extremely low. There was no significant improvement in sales of ordinary wholesale "Zhenmei." The Pingshui merchants and Meizhuang were also sluggish. In addition, the prices of "Zhenmei," "Xiumei," and other varieties were declining, and the market was very pessimistic.</p>

<p>The inventory of U.S. Flag Brand tinplate has recently become unusually shallow and scarce. However, sales are very brisk, resulting in a situation where the supply cannot meet demand.

It is reported that cigarette companies and can factories made purchases yesterday, with transactions reaching 600-700 boxes. Furthermore, frequent telegrams from overseas indicate rising prices, which has boosted confidence among market participants.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Middle School Principal Flees with Funds <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been a world of scams, but such scams have not been very common in the education sector. The newspaper reported the other day that Shi Yunjin, from Haimen, Jiangsu, established the Dajiang Vocational Middle School at 1034 Tangshan Road in Shanghai during this year's summer vacation. Student recruitment and school affairs were managed by his father, Shi Tangmin, and brothers Shi Yunlong and Yuncheng. Shi, a graduate of a certain university, appointed himself as the principal and recruited over 130 students. Unexpectedly, the Shi family, father and sons, on August 31 (the day before classes were scheduled to begin), packed up all the school's assets and fled.</p>
<p>The 130-plus students were naturally thrown into a state of confusion, completely baffled and panicking. They then drafted a declaration appealing to all sectors of society. In addition to exposing the above-mentioned facts and realities, the declaration also included a poignant description of their plight, worth quoting a few sentences: ("...Tears are useless, and there is nowhere to turn. We are stranded in a state of being out of school. In this year of social and economic bankruptcy, it is already very difficult for our parents to send their children to middle school for education. Now, this unfortunate event is so heartbreaking..."). ("...Rather than saying it's a school fraud, it's more accurate to say it's a family's conspiracy. ...We request severe punishment for the Shi family, father and sons, who are social bandits, engaging in hooligan behavior and disgracing the education sector...").</p>
<p>This kind of educational scam is not entirely absent in this evil society of Shanghai. However, in the past, it seemed to be limited to those cram schools (whose sole purpose was to make a profit) or very small alleyway elementary schools. They would place an advertisement in the newspaper, collect a sum of money, and then abscond. The harm caused was limited to a small number of people.</p>
<p>But this time, the scale is much larger. I often hear people saying that Chinese education is bankrupt. The performance of this event has truly shocked the Chinese masses. A dignified middle school, a dignified bachelor-principal, are now serving as the vanguard of educational bankruptcy. Where is Chinese education headed? This is a question that should be raised.</p>
<p>Shanghai, Shanghai, was originally a "paradise," and Shanghai's education has always been regarded as "heavenly education." Young people in the interior all yearn to come to Shanghai! Elementary school students hope to come to Shanghai for middle school, and middle school students hope to come to Shanghai for university. Therefore, the outer shell of Shanghai's education has become very developed. Even though schools are as dense as shops, students still flock to them like a tide. This year, the entire country is mired in a severe drought and flood disaster, and schools in the interior are all feeling the loss of students, but Shanghai is still very prosperous.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai is ultimately like a paper tiger. The economic downturn in the city can be seen from the rows of businesses closing down on Avenue Edward VII, and one can imagine the situation elsewhere. Therefore, all kinds of scams are being staged even more fiercely.</p>
<p>This middle school principal's flight with funds is a powerful illustration of this.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Night Record in Autumn Rain <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Bai She</p>
<p>Jingan Temple Road on a rainy night.</p>
<p>The neon lights cast many winding, beautiful reflections on the road surface, and the road, washed by the rain, is a shallow stream!</p>
<p>In recent years, my life has been too far removed from the city. In my mind, it seems that daytime has light, and nighttime is only fit for enduring in darkness. When a single candle is lit, facing the dimness of the four walls, I dare not generate any more hope. Life seems to have a rhythm, but it always feels too rigid.</p>
<p>Thinking back, it was early summer when I came to Shanghai from the water villages of the South. The city's high-speed energy gave me a lot of temptation, and I generated many illusions during my journey. Excitement was, of course, inevitable. But after arriving in Shanghai, life diverged sharply from my ideals. I really don't understand why ideals always fail to materialize. The scramble for food made it hard for me to catch my breath, and the high-speed everything accentuated my own slowness.</p>
<p>After a month in the countryside, I still longed for Shanghai. Often, gazing at the sky of Shanghai, reddened by lights, I over-praised Shanghai in my heart. But at this moment, strolling in the heart of this city, I am wooden and unresponsive. The rain is seeping in densely from the broken seams of the umbrella. Passing the Simmons billboard, the woman on the Simmons is also soaked, smiling lazily.</p>
<p>Turning the corner, the clock on the Racecourse pointed to seven o'clock. Looking further afield, isn't that Shanghai's night market? High on the rooftops of the big companies, red and blue lines are running. We should think of going into its embrace, of the coquettish eyes of the night tour, but the rain is getting heavier.</p>
<p>I walk in the torrential rain, I laugh, because I have no purpose and no hope. Rainy days show a special charm. Am I seeking a bitter poem?</p>
<p>The men and women immersed in the Silver Palace are now being spat out by that beautiful wide mouth. Before they have even finished savoring the plot, they are hit head-on by this sudden rain. Pleasure is so difficult and never lasts!</p>
<p>The raindrops are becoming denser and heavier, and the neon-red market, like a dream, is shrouded in a layer of dream-like gauze. The neon signs embedded in the deep blue sky are gradually blurring, blurring to the point of being unrecognizable. Yes, Shanghai is such a blurred, unrecognizable thing.</p>
<p>By the time I reached my lodgings, my clothes were already soaked through. Entering the room, a wave of damp, stuffy air rushed to my head. The sound of the rain was still intense. When the sky clears, autumn will be several degrees older. I was still thinking this as I went to sleep.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Endless Nonsense <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Gai</p>
<p>Someone who has experienced hunger knows how hard hunger is. If you ask a well-fed person what hunger feels like, they can't even imagine it. Even if they can imagine it, it won't be very real.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was an emperor who heard his ministers report that "the people are starving and have no food to eat." He asked without hesitation, "Why don't you teach them to eat porridge?" Well-fed people assume that people who have no rice to eat don't eat porridge. In fact, people who can eat a meal of porridge a day are not in a bad situation. There are many more people in this world who can't even dream of eating a meal of porridge a day.</p>
<p>There was also the son of a wealthy family who was always full from eating snacks all day long. His mother still forced him to eat rice and porridge five times a day. He told people: "Eating is really torture!" Well-fed people are strangers to hunger, so they naturally hate eating.</p>
<p>Semonoy's novel "Hunger" depicts the physiological and psychological abnormalities of hungry people with exquisite detail. But if you've seen Chaplin's film "The Gold Rush," that kind of performance can move you even more. When a person is hungry, their physiology changes, and their eyes are blurred. He repeatedly mistook his companions for a big hen, and he wanted to eat the big hen, but when he looked closely, it was his companion. How profound a performance is that?</p>
<h3 id="e215">Hesitation <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Nan</p>
<p>The sunset glow is gradually, gradually fading away. In the west, which is rendered in the golden glow of the setting sun, countless returning crows are flying in rows towards the vast end of the sky. Ah! At this evening hour, when everything needs a destination, isn't it the hard-working peasant women of the suburbs dragging their tired souls towards their destination, the home hiding in the woods over there?</p>
<p>Although here, one is spared the attacks of the city's troubles, the encirclement of those inherent sounds of the marketplace, but it is divorced from that sinful rendering. However, the sounds of the factories letting off steam at dusk and at dawn are truly difficult to escape the trampling of bad luck!</p>
<p>A crow sometimes cries out one or two sad sounds. In the rustling of the fallen leaves of this dusk, in the gentle, soft sway of the evening breeze, here it does not disturb this natural elegy. However, in my heart, it draws a shadow of sorrow. In the lonely soul of a wanderer fallen to the ends of the earth, a tragic exile in a foreign land who has lost his destination, hesitating so lost in this suburb of a city pregnant with misery. If hesitation did not require bread, then I would willingly hesitate like this. However, the need for the burning of hunger, the need for clothes, and the prayer for a destination... people cannot dream so much, can they?</p>
<p>The sky is gradually getting darker, and a dim magic veil is about to envelop the earth. However, how will I, this hesitating ghost, settle myself? In the woods over there? No. In this vast wilderness, who can guarantee that no wild beasts will come? At someone's house over there? Who is your friend, who is your relative? Moreover, in this vast and ruthless crowd, even friends and relatives are different in that they fawn over the rich. Although one says that these strangers might pity you, a beggar-like person? It's even less possible to go under those skyscrapers over there. There are too many unemployed and breadless wanderers! Hesitate, hesitate, in this long darkness, let him do a somersault!</p>

<h3 id="e216">A Dark Heart <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Fei</p>
<p>It's autumn!</p>
<p>Stepping on the fallen leaves of the plane trees, in the afterglow of dusk, I walked alone across that long embankment. When my small building, where I had lived for so many years, came into view, my footsteps slowed down as if being dragged backwards: a dark heart, a dark heart locked in that dark building!</p>
<p>Youth has been wasted like this, the long days of five years!</p>
<p>She took my hand and said softly, five years ago, to cherish my sister and my small building as if cherishing me? I contained my tears, like a lone goose lost in the autumn sky, leaving its sorrow in the world. She stopped her last breath.</p>
<p>So I and a twelve-year-old girl guarded this small building, like an old monk in meditation; forgetting the world, forgetting friends. Watching the peach blossoms bloom and fall from the window; listening to the angry roar of thunder in the middle of the night; the autumn wind bringing white snow flakes in bursts; I stared at the good-looking photo and asked the girl;</p>
<p>(It's another year?)</p>
<p>(It's another year! Brother-in-law, when will we leave here?)</p>
<p>A pair of black eyes, the same as in the photo, flashed in front of me (When the autumn geese return,)</p>
<p>The girl suddenly pulled my hand, left the small building, crossed the long embankment, and went to her grave.</p>
<p>The green grass on the ground was green and lovely again; the orioles returned, singing enchanting spring songs; the dust on the tombstone had been swept away by the willow branches; but why was the woman in the white dress crying so sadly?</p>
<p>I looked up for no reason, white clouds chasing white clouds, weaving a beautiful sky.</p>
<p>(Sister,) the girl said, holding the tombstone: (When the autumn geese return, we will leave here, don't you feel lonely, sister, I'll give you a bouquet of small flowers.)</p>
<p>She picked the wildflowers in front of the grave, put them on the stone steps, and stared down at the tips of her own shoes.</p>
<p>Sorrow, desolation, overwhelmed the girl's heart; but, but when the autumn geese returned, she could not stand the loneliness of the small building, left me, left her sister's grave, and left, with no news of her for a year.</p>
<p>It's autumn!</p>
<p>I supported myself with a cane, with a heavy heart, and with heavy steps, went alone to the graveyard. The tombstone had been eroded by wind and rain, and was no longer so smooth and glossy. The withered branches of the wildflowers had long been taken away by the autumn wind, like the withered yellow plane tree leaves; like that pair of big black eyes, before my eyes was desolation, loneliness, only the crying of the woman in white accompanied my endless sorrow.</p>
<p>Looking up, white clouds chasing white clouds, a picture of autumn's beautiful sky!</p>
<p>On the long embankment, gazing at that dark small building, five years!</p>
<h3 id="e217">Childhood Memories <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Rou Wu</p>
<p>Time passes ruthlessly, like flowing water. It's been ten years since my father and mother died.</p>
<p>My father was similar to most fathers, but more capable and strict than my mother. He didn't have the same enthusiasm for playing with the children as my mother did. He was struggling in life all day long. And my mother? Just the opposite of my father, she was kind and affectionate. She loved me as much as she loved her own life. When I returned from school every afternoon, she would put down whatever she was doing and hold me in her arms, kissing me passionately. Sometimes she would tell me to pout my little lips and gently tap them. Then she would call out a string of loving words: (My child! My good child! My darling, my precious!), as if she wanted to swallow me whole. However, my mother's love for me made me less close to her, and I often liked to be near my father, who didn't love me so much. But my father's love for me couldn't match even one-third of my mother's. Sometimes I would stand very close to him, hoping he would hug me for a moment, or touch me, or at least look at me, but it was impossible. He wore a pair of reading glasses, wrinkled his brow, and had a solemn face, holding a brush in one hand and manipulating abacus beads in the other. His face twitched as if he were muttering something. Sometimes he looked unhappy, and sometimes he showed a very happy face. He was just calculating his confounded accounts. When I couldn't get my father's love, I would take it out on my mother, falling into her arms, clenching my small fists, and hitting my mother's chest desperately, but my mother didn't stop me in any way, nor did she cry out in pain. Instead, she smiled and said to me: (Good darling, hit harder, hit harder.)</p>
<p>She seemed to enjoy being hit by me, and as a result, my hands became sore. I hadn't released my anger, but instead increased my anger. I had no choice but to hide in my mother's arms and cry inexplicably. This situation often caused my mother to suffer, not knowing why. At this time, she would be anxious and sweating, wrinkling her brow and saying: (Darling! Are you not feeling well anywhere? Do you want to buy something? Tell me! Mom will go to the street to buy it for you.)</p>
<p>When my mother said this, I cried even harder, even more vigorously. I didn't stop until I was extremely tired and fell asleep. Because of this, my mother sighed in pain all the time.</p>
<p>Thinking about such things now, there is only bewilderment, only tears falling uncontrollably! That stern father and kind mother passed away one after another ten years ago. One was cruelly beaten to death by bandits, and one died of illness within a short period of time. At the same time, I don't know where my childhood heart has gone. Alas! Everything from childhood is no longer attainable, the past is not to be recalled!</p>

<p>— Jun</p>
<p>Remembering Old Friends in the South</p>
<p>Autumn in the South is the delightful season when longans come to market.</p>
<p>That distant sea, that distant shore, deeply buries the golden dreams and golden yearnings of my youth. Everything there is charming: the sky is jade-like, all azure blue, and the sea is also azure, lying under the warm, tranquil sunshine, rippling with boundless, gentle waves. Every dusk, with a light heart, I would stroll with a woman through the dense shade of the longan trees, watching the sunset on the opposite shore reflected in the heart of the sea, faintly weaving into brilliant colorful clouds, listening to the tiny waves at our feet, gnawing at the beach with cricket-like sounds, sometimes receding, then soon washing back up again. It was like listening to the rhythms of natural music.</p>
<p>Intoxicated in that poetic dusk, shoulder to shoulder, whispering sweet nothings, time would just pass by like that, forgetting to return home, sitting on stone benches until the moon poured silver light from the gaps in the trees into the deep night…</p>
<p>Autumn has come again, ah, my golden dreams, and golden yearnings?</p>
<p>My body, I don’t know when, has drifted to this foreign land, while my soul still flies to that distant, distant other side of the sea. That side of the sea once held traces of my private affections, that side of the sea has already buried golden dreams, golden yearnings, perhaps even covered with a thick layer of mud and sand, a thick layer of the mud and sand of years.</p>
<p>The honeyed taste of longans and their black, bead-like seeds, ah!</p>
<p>Whenever I think of autumn in the South, I can’t help but think of Linlin, nourished in the warm sunshine, with those moving, black, longan-seed-like eyes, Linlin, who has a melodious, musical voice and black eyes and hair. And that clear smile that brews a spring-like love in the autumn season, a dream of a season.</p>
<p>But where has Linlin gone? Has Linlin’s heart changed with the autumn? I know Linlin’s heart is forever joyful and carefree.</p>
<p>Because Linlin is a little sparrow suited to living under the warm sunshine.</p>
<p>But the wanderer's journey and the desert-like state of mind, a heart as desolate as the desert, and a joyful heart are separated by heavy mountains and heavy seas.</p>
<p>Happy times have sunk like shooting stars in the sky. Linlin, the appointment to meet again after three autumns is now more than three years overdue. Perhaps this appointment will become an eternal regret. The fate of iron ore cannot produce beautiful fruit. Besides indulging in dream-like intoxication with lingering tears in my dreams, what else can I hope for? I am already prepared to silently chew on the bitterness of life, carrying the cross of crucifixion, and from now on destroy all the yearnings in the world. Only you, Linlin, your face on the gray screen of my heart will never wither, forever an immortal statue of the soul. However, I wish you to be joyful, to live joyfully under the warm sunshine of the South, joyfully.</p>
<p>I don't want you to wither your youth too quickly because of worry and sorrow, Linlin!</p>
<p>These long days, this long wandering life, I have no feeling, no joy, not even fantasy. Every day is the same! Watching the sun rise and sink, listening to my own sunset dirge with the sound of time, silently passing from my heart, from my ears, passing by, I have not a single feeling. I just sigh silently, sighing. Autumn in the South is lovely. But autumn can only give me a degree of sadness. Linlin, what about you?</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Upon investigation, it was indeed correct. That evening, Magistrate Rui ordered a coffin to be bought and placed in the main hall. He ordered that Yue official to lie down in it, and then ordered other military officers to cut a knife into his chest. He then covered the coffin and had it carried away and buried overnight.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Xu Zhai lightly closed his eyes, as if the bloody appearance of that Yue official was right in front of him. However, now the strict Magistrate Rui, who commanded the army, has now fled to a foreign warship. Such awe-inspiring figures have also met with such an end. Xu Zhai picked up the newspaper again to read:</p>
<p>It is heard that the hearts of the soldiers of Admiral Sa’s fleet are very unstable. When firing the cannons, the cannons all fired into the sky, and no revolutionaries were injured or killed. Therefore, the fleet has docked downstream. There is a small gunboat whose soldiers have all surrendered to the revolution. The ship is currently docked near Jiujiang because it cannot navigate elsewhere.</p>
<p>Tang Hualong telegraphed to the Beijing Diplomatic Corps and the Customs Service to request them to send personnel to observe the battle.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an imperial conference was held, followed by a secret order to the Governor of Shaanxi to properly arrange matters in Xi'an.</p>
<p>Yuan Shikai telegraphed a memorial requesting permission to lead troops forward on the second day of the ninth month, with Duan Zhigui as the commander of the advance troops, and presented six strategies for quelling the rebellion. The Emperor approved with praise and ordered him to quickly advance to comfort the court's worries.</p>
<p>A certain censor memorialized that the situation is critical, the military expenses are huge, and the treasury is depleted. He requested that internal funds be issued to encourage the morale of the troops.</p>
<p>Governor Rui hid on a foreign warship and fled the city. The court ordered Yuan Shikai to handle the situation as he sees fit.</p>
<p>Beijing officials are fleeing Beijing one after another.</p>
<p>The United States has proposed that the success of the revolution in Hubei will spread to other provinces, and the war cannot be ended in a short time. Moreover, it is feared that after the revolution spreads, its leaders may not be able to restrain themselves adequately, which will lead to anti-foreign sentiment, greatly affecting the property and interests of foreigners in China. The whole world believes that this revolution will overthrow the government and expel the Manchus. If this step is taken, when China's diplomacy with various countries is not yet settled, if the various countries do not pre-negotiate a common policy and a method to respond to changes, international disputes will inevitably arise. The United States has initiated this matter in order to protect the interests of China and foreigners. The United States not only has no intention of interfering, but also wants to prevent other countries from interfering arbitrarily. If a country is compelled to interfere, it must not do so without the fair consent of all countries.</p>
<p>On the twenty-eighth day of the eighth month, the Cabinet received an imperial edict from the Regent, Prince Regent, and Empress Dowager Longyu, stating that the southern provinces have been repeatedly flooded recently, and this year there are bandits rebelling in Hubei. Considering the hunger and distress of the refugees who have lost their homes, We deeply sympathize with them and are eager to provide relief. Now, 200,000 taels of silver will be allocated from the internal funds in the palace left by Empress Xiaoling Xian. The Ministry of Internal Affairs will hand it over to Yuan Shikai to appoint suitable personnel to verify the situation in the Hubei area and provide relief to the disaster victims. Respect this.</p>
