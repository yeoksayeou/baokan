<p>時評</p>
<h3>中央準備組織國防委員會　廷</h3>
<p>鞏固國防。保衛疆土。乃政府應盡之天職。故列强均以研究國防爲先務之急。其於本國海陸要塞之經營。戰鬥人員之訓練。戰時經濟之凖備。一一深思熟慮。規劃周詳。而外交上情勢之變化。「假想敵」國力之消長。亦莫不極端注意。蓋所以確保立國之安全耳。惟然。故各國與其「假想敵」雙方之實力。瞭若指掌。無所容其隠飾。而彼此以對方戒備嚴密故。反不敢輕易啓　。所謂「武裝和平」之局面。乃賴以成立。我國與世無忤。而强鄰偪處雖無「假想敵」之樹立。而有侵略者之可懼。形勢危始。無可諱言。奈内亂紛乘。國防空虛。此所以喪權辱國之慘禍。不能消弭於無形也。</p>
<p>夫國防乃立國命脈。必由各項專門人才。年積月累。悉心布置。始有把握。初非一朝一夕之功。一手一足之烈。所能集事。我國自海禁洞開以來。對於國防大計。向不聞問。每吃一次大虧。乃有一次大懺悔。但亦不過自怨自艾而止。凄假則以時過境遷。又復忘懷。自東北失守。當局曾有國防設計委員會之組織。然顧名思義。所謂設計云者。當不外乎研究性質。徒知研究。而不能實行。則與紙上談兵何異。最近中央有另組國防委員會之議。其有自理論研究而進於實際執行之意乎。若然。則不可謂非國難聲中之一要政也。</p>
<p>顧通常言國防者。皆着眼於軍事。一若除軍事外。卽無所謂國防。而吾人以爲軍事財政外交三者。乃國防建設之三大柱石。互相倚賴而不可偏廢。吾國養兵二百餘萬。而敵騎壓境。無法驅除。蓋以冗兵太多。而給養不足。質不勝量故也。今日不言國防則已。欲言國防。非先設法使國家之軍費負擔與其財政力量。相適稱不可。一旦兵士之餉糈有着。軍費之凖備充足。則政府之威信自振。軍紀之整飭。易而戰鬥力之長進亦必加速。以此勁旅。爲國効命。乃始進可以戰。退可以守。</p>
<p>再言國防與外交之關係。理亦易解蘇秦以合縱說六國。六國聽之。强秦不得乘。蘇聯發揮其「多邊外交」之手腕。與西歐訂互不侵犯條約。而日兵不敢踏進其國境一寸。是皆受外交之賜。反之。日人宰割我國土。殺戮我人民。亦未始非因吾國外交孤立無援之故。今後願我當局高瞻遠矚。早定外交方針。其有補於國防者實多。</p>
<p>總之。吾人以爲籌劃國防。刻不容緩。但須兼顧軍事財政與外交三者。缺一不可。當兹國防委員會行將成立之頃。敢以滿腔𤍠誠。希望其完成應負之使命。</p>

<h3>羅斯福致國會文</h3>
<p>改善金融狀况</p>
<p>充分統制通貨</p>
<p>導成一般協定</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統致國會文曰、依照吾人現所爲恢復更適當的物價之進步、以期卒達美元更少變化的購買力、余請國會再核准某種法案、以改善金融與貨幣狀况、苟能使人明瞭吾人現在設立政府所有之永遠硬貨凖備金、則吾人定能組織穏健而充分之通貨統制、通貨爲政府特權、許多人主張以金銀爲吾人貨幣之本位、或用單純制、或用混合比率、雖世界現狀紊亂、但吾人希望事態現漸可導成將來一般恊定之形式、</p>
<p>在此緊急時代、個人或國際轉讓黃金之習慣、不獨爲非必要、且亦爲不應有、爲抵付國際貿易差額計、始有轉讓大批黃金之必要、故國内作貨幣用之黃金、其所有權歸諸政府、實爲善策、而此黃金應以金條形式、而非以金幣形式保藏之、政府已發令接收私人或團體所有之黃金、今聯邦儲備銀行尙存有大宗現金、雖照現行法律、政府有權依據行政法將美國人民所有之貨幣金完全收爲國有、但以茲事體大、故余寗願商諸國會、用特殊法案、將美國人民所有黃金之供給悉數收歸政府、而附有以金劵抵付所收現金之條文、金劵隨時以財部之黃金爲担保、照</p>
<p>額給付美元、而此種美元之重量與成分、可隨時規定之、此種法案可使政府對於國内金凖備享有所有權、並使爲公共福利起見、而减輕美元金成分、因此而得之利益、亦屬諸政府、如爲公共福利起見、而有增多美元中金成分之需要、則損失亦由政府負之、</p>
<p>黃金所有權旣全歸政府、則所有存金、可爲永久固定之硬貨凖備、其數之增减、僅於淸理國際差額時或將來國際恊定分配世界存金時行之、此種永遠政策、一經成立、則時機已至、可更確切决定美元之金價値矣、</p>
<p>世界大局未定、故余以爲爲公共利益計、今尙未可决定切實價値、余照目前法案、有權决定以百分之五十爲可許的最低限度、余在愼重研究後、覺重定幣價、而超過目前價値百分之六十者、殊非公共利益、故余請國會規定重定幣價、以百分之六十爲可許的最高限度、爲凖備吾人在對外匯率中謀定更大安定起見、財長除有權在國内外買賣黃金外、更宜有權應付對外匯兌、美元减値後之利益、撥出二十萬萬元、爲買賣黃金外匯與政府貨劵、及調節通貨、維持信用、及其他用途云、</p>
<p>羅斯福總統暗示、現行法律、與處理黃金及其他貨幣事件有關者、將予以修正、謂銀爲通貨本位由來已久、其本身實爲通貨、世人之以銀爲幣者殆居半數、此爲吾人自己貨幣結構中最重要部份之一、銀爲世界國際商業中之要素、誠未可忽視也、十二月二十一日曾發通吿、擬鼓鑄銀幣、增加銀凖備、而使美國成首先履行銀恊定之國、銀恊定乃趨向正路之一步驟、吾人現正履行之云、</p>
<p>羅總統繼言及在世界經濟大會中所發之諾言、謂凡此諾言、如關係國政府一一履行之、則銀之用途與價値當可大增、美政府亦可用銀爲通貨本位、余屬望銀用途之增多、但余現不欲向國會有何建議、以擴大銀於貨幣上之用途、因余信吾人用其他貨幣辦法、可更詳悉倫敦恊定之結果也云、</p>
<p>羅總統注重兩種原則、第一、國家通貨必須維持其健全、使有恒久之購買力、且足敷逐日之需用與信用之確立、第二、政府有權發行通貨、而爲通貨本位之唯一保護人與主人、因此政府應有隨時决定硬貨凖備之範圍與性質、羅總統末稱、余信國民定能了解政府維持信用與成立一種健全的交換媒介物、以供人民需要之旨趣云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福之解釋</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統向新聞記者說明其致國會文、謂其貨幣計劃中最急切之目的、在使美元購買力恢復其在美國平均　債務發生時之程度、庶可用與從前發生債務時同樣價値之美元償還債務、此種程序並非欲濫發紙幣、政府欲獲權力、俾可撥用平凖基金、以收買政府公債之作用、僅在保障公債價格、免私人執有公債者之賤售耳云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福三道命令</h3>
<p>統制銀行私人匯兌</p>
<p>阻止資本流出國外</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日羅斯福總統根據其致國會之咨文、發出三道命令、（一）擴大去年三月十日命令之範圍、凡私人及註册之各銀行、均可從事國外匯兌、（二）凡從事國外匯兌之人、一律均須向政府立案註册、（三）美國鑄幣局、得政府允許、可收受生金、惟所收買之生金、須按照財部規定價値作價、手續費爲百分之三五、因此規定、金價每盎司當値三十四元三角六分、據一般人之觀察、其第二條之命令實係阻止資本流出國外之一步驟（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>垣街爲之一振</h3>
<p>紐約劃爲生金自由購買市塲說</p>
<p>（紐約）自羅斯福總統咨文發表以後、垣街空氣爲之一振、股票及物品等交易大爲活動、公債亦看好、此間有一種傳說、謂總統將劃紐約爲生金自由購買市塲、藉可維持國際間之金融及投資、至於目下對於總統咨文之影響、卽鼓動白銀及金元匯價有續跌之勢云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福貨幣政策安定幣價切實步驟國會反響極爲良好</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今日在參衆兩院提出貨幣案、財長摩甘索聲稱、從一月十六日起、新出礦之凈金、官定價格爲每盎斯三十四元四角五分、减去千分之二五手續費云、</p>
<h3>新貨幣之重要條文</h3>
<p>貨幣案之重要條文、大旨如下、</p>
<p>（一）聯邦儲備金之所有權移交財政部、而財政部以同等價値之美元、予儲備銀行以金劵、</p>
<p>（二）現金一槪不得流通、廢止金幣、聊聯邦儲備銀行所執之金劵外、任何通幣、不得在財長所認爲維持各種通幣同等購買力所必要之數額中、兌換黃金、</p>
<p>（三）財長經總統批准後、有權在國内外購買黃金、不限數額、</p>
<p>（四）財長可先付公債之利息、並在國内外售出黃金、財長爲安定匯兌計、可買賣或折扣匯票支票及匯兌票據、並收受債據、</p>
<h3>羅斯福安定蹩價運動</h3>
<p>以上爲貨幣案中之主要點、羅斯福總統稱、渠固不贊成紙幣政策、但發行有限額不帶息之五元與十元鈔票、如湯姆士修正文所規定者、似未可謂爲濫發紙幣、渠自信能在十分之五六限價中安定美元價格、渠以爲美國安定幣價之運動、可促成他國通貨之定價、計美元中金成分减輕後、政府可獲利益、約在三十四萬萬元與四十二萬萬元之間云、</p>
<h3>今夜起黃金槪歸國有</h3>
<p>財長摩甘索已限定星期三夜爲私人將其所有黃金繳與財部之最後日期、至於聯邦儲備銀行存金尙不在内、估計其數約在三十五萬萬元以上、金融善後社已將其所有金額增至一萬五千萬元、除二千五百萬元外、餘已用去、國内收買計六十八萬一千盎斯、値二千二百八十九萬八千元、國外收買計値九千七百萬元、金融善後社主任瓊斯聲稱、美元之重定價格可使善後社獲黃金上之利益、因善後社可在國外售金也、善後社國外黃金指定在倫敦與巴黎提用云、</p>
<h3>行政令三道統制外滙</h3>
<p>羅斯福總統發出行政命令三道、宣佈政府統制對外匯兌交易、銀行與私人皆適用領照政策、白宮聲稱、此項命令在實際上與三月十日所發之條例相同、不過私人之作對外匯兌者、亦適用此條例、不僅銀行適用而已也、聞新命令之作用在使財長摩甘索得施其手腕、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>國會中反響極爲良好</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅總統此文今日在紐約市塲之影響、爲新礦金價格由每盎斯三十四元零六分躍至三十四元三角四分、此數與美元中金成分什六高限度之决定相適合國會中對於羅總統文之第一反響極爲良好、民主黨一致援助羅總統、而參院共和黨亦召集本黨會議考慮其政策、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法待國際最後協定美元英鎊皆已跌價佛郎穏定似無問題日本將再抑低幣價</h3>
<p>（倫敦）羅斯福總統致國會文傳至倫敦、適在營業時期之後、故今日倫敦未有若何反響、但衆覺美元重定價格爲百分之六十、雖使英法受其影響、但猶可忍受、以待最後之國際恊定、衆料羅總統現願有國際恊定之成立也、美國留有再减美元價値什一之餘地、衆視此爲美國用作對他國磋商之工具、如美元削價超過什四、則勢將使法國亦抛棄金本位、則美國現有之優勢、爲羅總統所欲維持愈久愈佳者、將因之喪失也、羅總統之文、在閉市後始到巴黎、但今日美元與金鎊皆已跌價矣、巴黎現頗形參差恐慌、但佛郎之穏定似無問題、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國金政策之宣佈、倫敦未答以不同情之接受、此政策之詳細說明、已减少市塲之惶慮、倫敦人士覺此乃趨向國際通貨安定之切實步驟、今日證劵市塲之最大反響、爲市人對於金礦股票之注意、南斐西澳與西斐金礦股價皆有向上趨、美國證劵亦堅、惟英國頭等證劵與鐵路股票有人賣出、蓋欲得資以從事於將來投機事業也、紡織股票較前鬆動、其故爲美日紡織品競爭、將愈劇烈之惶慮、蓋料日本或將一再抑低其幣値也、外匯市塲中英鎊較他國金幣爲弱、察其原因、似爲美人方面在倫敦等處之大批收買黃金與金幣、雖羅總統文中未含有可使美國人售出其銀之處、但銀價現呈鬆動之象、英國物品市價同情於美國市塲、亦較前爲高、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>英内閣討論貿易影響</h3>
<p>或將增加關稅</p>
<p>杜防美貨傾銷</p>
<p>（倫敦）英内閣今日開常會時、將討論美元减値所及于英國貿易之影響、並將設法防杜美貨傾銷于不列顚帝國、聞英内閣如見美貨源源輸入、則將增加現行稅率、或將以前無稅之貨、征收新稅、凡决定之辦法、將邀各自治地合作、俾收實效、據此間財政界聲稱、美總統昨致國會之咨文、至少將使金本位暫時陷于厄運中、又據接近英倫銀行之當道吿美聯社訪員稱、美元依照羅斯福總統咨文减輕成分後、將使美貨在外國貿易中競爭益烈、此舉將逼令現仍死守金位本之數國、作抑抵幣値之競賽、美總統之咨文、使倫敦大爲驚詫、英鎊對美匯價開盤五元一角半、旋低至五元一角五分半、據此間財政界預料、凈値六角之美金、將令鎊價達五元四角五分、或尙有續低之可能云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>法國財長關心佛郎</h3>
<p>或足影響英鎊</p>
<p>認與佛郎無害</p>
<p>（巴黎）財長龐萊聞美國總統羅斯福以關於貨幣之咨文送達國會之後、曾與所屬人員及法蘭西銀行行員季盧、舉行重要會議、討論美國貨幣政策所能發生之影響、負責方面以爲美總統之咨文、或足以影響英鎊、但佛郎則不獨絶無妨害、且其價値反因此日益鞏固、卽外國資本家亦將以較爲穏定之貨幣視之、而樂於購取云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本政府憂慮前途</h3>
<p>主張改變產金政策</p>
<p>日匯跌落影響我國</p>
<p>（東京）政府因美國實行减低元價、憂慮日美匯兌之前途、擬樹立安定匯兌之方策、大藏省當局亦頗重視本問題、决意研究其方法、大藏省内主張改變國内產金政策、重新樹立金政策之根本方針、並採用買收國内產金與平均匯兌資金制度之意見、漸次有力、卽現行之外國匯兌管理制度、僅以抑制匯兌投機爲目的、並無積極安定匯兌行市之機能、因此必要實行新辦法、以制止將來日金高漲、安定匯兌行市之搖動、然高橋藏相從來見解、反對人爲的匯兌安定政策、故究意採用何種方法、頗爲各方面所注目、（十六日聯）</p>
<p>（華聯社本埠消息）據某銀行家談云、日匯連日續跌、今日之日金百元祗値國幣八十六元、因此日貨運華更爲有利、日之匯兌傾銷政策、於我國提倡國貨運動之前途予以莫大之打擊、以今日之匯價計算、一元之日貨、在我國僅售八角六分、尙甚合算、若我政府不提早設法應付、國貨前途、將不堪設想、日商預料日匯將再跌至七十元左右云、</p>
<h3>美財長表示仍擬借債</h3>
<p>美英法恊定如成</p>
<p>國際幣價即安定</p>
<p>（華盛頓）財長摩甘索今日聲稱、政府仍擬借入一百萬萬元、但因美元减値所得之利益、可用以應付政府之費用、財部擬以每盎斯二十元六角七分之舊價格接收金融善後社所有之黃金、其損失由善後社員負之云、摩甘索又稱、渠以爲美英法之恊定、足可促成國際幣價之安定、美國存金未嘗不可以商業信用之形式分配於他國、如法國放棄金本位、則將碍及美國貨幣政策、因其將改變金價也、政府現已發出行政命令、凡美國法定通貨如銀幣等、除領有執照者外、不許運出美境、外匯交易與信用轉移爲尋常商業所需者、可許照舊辦理、無須領照、參議員湯姆士語人、謂此乃較任何膨脹派所期望者更爲廣大之膨脹行爲、美國貨幣銀皆得收爲國有、與黃金同一辦法、若干銀輔幣將繼續流通、但大批現銀則將集儲於國庫中、爲發行紙幣之凖備云、紐約太陰報謂多數銀行家與經濟學家以爲美元减價値什四、猶嫌過少、（十六日路透電）</p>

<p>昨晚「碧玉」號飛經柯比尼天空、飛行甚低、於七點四十分突聞轟然鉅聲、未及數杪鐘、全機着火、裂成數千百燒紅之碎片、四處散墮、其機身之骨樑、抛擲至離失事地點五十公尺處、可見轟炸之猛烈矣、機身燃燒甚烈、無法近前、雖力圖援救燒成焦土之乘客、亦已不及、憲兵馳至、則僅從機内搶出若干紙片、及個人用品而已、憲兵繼乃設法維持秩序、以免各處羣集之好奇觀衆、觸勳燒焦之乘客屍身及燒殘之機身、至於失事情形、非俟數日後、無由詳悉、或竟永成秘謎、亦未可知、</p>

<h3>肇禍原因尙待調查</h3>
<p>另有親聞爆裂聲者、則謂該機失事、係因飛行時養氣瓶爆發所致、該養氣瓶乃係供開動引擎之用者、但確實原因、則必俟官方調查後、方可斷定、按「碧玉」號前曾由飛行家陶雷駕駛作種種之試騐以後、又經一百五十小時之速續飛行云（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>招商局滬靑綫普安輪在吳淞口外爲盜騎刼海盜十五名迫令改駛滬粵綫盜在詔安下船擄去旅客九名損失約五六千金今日可返滬</h3>
<p>招商局普安號輪、本月十三日、自滬開赴靑島、海盜十五名、在上海混充旅客上船、行至吳淞外蛇尾山洋面北十八海哩、卽開始行刦、並將船舶逼往汕頭洋面、被刦銀錢物件甚夥、臨行又架去乘客九名、現滬局已電致海軍部、派艦兜輯、並營救搭客、一面電令普安、開回上海、今日下午可以抵申、詳情分述如下、</p>
<h3>開赴靑島</h3>
<p>普安輪原爲海軍部之運輸軍艦、去年自招商租用、先航普陀靑島、祇以船身巨大、客位寬暢、又經招商局大修之下、殊爲旅客所歡迎、上年期滿後續租三月、乃改爲專航滬靑綫、營業注重載客、本月十三日由滬開往靑島、共有頭二三等乘客五十餘名、裝載貨物一萬一千餘件、自上海赴靑島、照例二十八小時、可以到達、預定十四日下午二時、駛抵靑島、詎屆時未見抵埠、靑島分局局長、又因公來滬、當經局員發電到滬、向總局探詢、滬總局得報、初疑海面有霧、普安輪或在途中抛泊、當命無綫電台方子衛發電XNPA呼號呌喚、但總無回音答復、甚爲焦急、昨據靑島電訊、怡和洋行赴靑之怡生輪船員言、謂曾在途中、發見普安錯行航道、船時、向南行更爲憂慮、迨至昨夜九始得普安船主電告被刦、</p>
<h3>海盜混入</h3>
<p>普安輪在滬開行時、係停於浦東華棧碼頭、該輪照例星期六上午九時半開行、乃十三日離滬時、遲至十時十五分、當時頭二等乘客已先上船、及至船將啓椗、又有統艙搭客十餘名倉皇趕到、亦搭普安赴靑、船員等忙於開船、對此輩乘客、未加注意、據無恙輪買辦盛吾年言、渠在普安輪解纜時、方始上陸、瞥見此批旅客、不先不後、乘開船時登輪、行迹頗覺可疑、但船已開動、未便再事檢查、船上人員、更不疑爲海盜之混入也、迨普安出口、亦事過境遷、比騎刦警耗到滬、始悉各海盜思慮周密、恐早到船内、被檢查發覺、故直至開航時登輪、利用時間、得以混進船内也、</p>
<h3>控制全船</h3>
<p>海盜十五名、完全粵音、武器等藏在身上分居統艙各處、因該輪並無鐡欄防盜設置、各級艙位、與駕駛臺領江臺等、均可自由通行、據船主事後來電報吿言、普安自出吳淞口、行至蛇尾山北十八海浬地、船已向北開駛、各海盜遂從統艙内、各執手槍、躍至艙面、先鳴槍爲號、擁至船主間、先將船主雷克斯、及大二副輪機長威逼監示、又將無綫電室占據、將電員朱舜看押、禁止通報、此時船上又無綫航隊、船主等所備自衛手槍、已逼令交出、船員等已失抵抗能力、祇得取不抵抗主義、全船統歸海盜控制、由盜逼令船主下命、改調方向、折往汕頭洋面、此十三日下午四時以後事也、</p>
<h3>行刧狀况</h3>
<p>海盜於控制全船後、乃開始行刦、先向大餐間·二等室·乘客搜刦、次至統艙内刦掠、凡旅客所帶現欵銀洋鈔幣、以及婦女飾品、無一不被刦去、最後、將旅客所帶較好衣服物件、亦被刦去、先後經數次洗刦、旅客船員等所有者、均被搜刦一空、盜將刦取之物、堆至艙内、然後取旅客皮箱、裝置贜物、船内事務長鄒倫所售船票銀洋、聞亦遭刦無餘、計被刦現欵衣物等項損失、約在五六千金、而詳細數目、尙待今日船到後、方可明瞭、</p>
<h3>損壞貨物</h3>
<p>此次普安輪内共裝麵粉八千包、白米一百十三包、洋布十五件、紙頭二千一百八十七件、香烟一百二十四箱、書籍一百六十六箱·橘子二百十一桶·餘爲海貨·蔴袋·鐵器·共計一萬一千餘件、但無貴重貨品、海盜曾逼船員開貨艙、取出香烟一箱、打開後、自由取吸、且分散與各客、又將洋布一件、打開取出若干疋、以作吊運贜物等下海逃逸之用、其餘各貨均未動取、故貨件損失、殊屬甚微、</p>
<h3>九客被架</h3>
<p>各海盜於刦掠後、以所得甚微、表示失望、遂將艙内旅客實行綁架、按此次普安輪中、乘有頭二等搭客十六人、内婦女小孩各四名、又統艙客四十餘人、盜將頭二等室中男客九名、盡行架綁、而於婦女小孩、則未驚動、被架旅客之姓名、（招商局有單可查故從略）招商局靑島分局長孫振武、適乘普安回靑、聞盜刦之訊、臨時乃化妝海員、得以逃免、未遭架去、事務長鄒倫及各船員、均未被綁、</p>
<h3>漁舟運贜</h3>
<p>至十五日下午七時左右、普安輪已開駛到閩粵交界處之詔安海面、船内海盜、行刦竣事、乃由盜匪數人、沿海找尋、發見漁舟兩艘、卽逼普安停船、將刦得贜物、及架綁肉票九人、就詔安洋面下漁舟而去、普安船主等在匪盜離船後、始整理一切、審定航道、開往汕頭暫泊、一面電吿上海總局報吿被盜情事、</p>
<h3>分電緝盜</h3>
<p>普安第一電報吿被盜、係在十五日夜九時到滬、時局内已無人、卽送交劉鴻生、至夜十一時半、又得到船主第二電報吿、劉鴻生會同船舶科辦理緝盜及營救被架旅客計、漏夜十二時、便發電至海軍部云、據普安船主電告、元日船抵蛇尾山北十八海哩、有喬裝搭客之海盜、搶刦旅客、均被洗刦、盜臨行擄去旅客九名、請速電駐閩艦隊兜剿、營救被掠乘客爲要、國營招商局劉鴻生銑叩、此電去後、又致電汕厦閩各分局、命轉請當地水陸軍警恊助兜剿、以免匪盜遠　、</p>
<h3>船已駛回</h3>
<p>昨日劉鴻生又發無綫電與普安船主、着令該船由汕頭尅回上海、昨午得普安電告、已經開航在途、預計現正北返、在北緯二十五度三七分、東經一百二十度之間、惟因氣候惡劣、大致須今日下午或明晨方可抵滬、</p>
<h3>各方探詢</h3>
<p>昨日此案發生後、乘搭該輪旅客家屬、紛紛到招商局探問情形者甚多、局中由總務科善爲答復、並加安慰、謂已請海軍當局營救矣、劉鴻生昨又將普安被刧事、根據船主報吿、電呈交部、輪船方面損失尙微、船員等均無傷害、</p>
<h3>比使昨夜晉京</h3>
<p>今日歡宴京當局</p>
<p>比國駐華全權公使紀佑穆與其夫人、昨夜乘夜快車晋京、定今日（十七）歡宴汪院長、並邀褚秘書長·外交部·實業部·鐵道部·及其他各部部長·次長·司長·等、作陪、並聞比使因來滬已久、故在京稍作逗留、卽北上返平云、</p>
<h3>英航空委員維洛克氏抵滬</h3>
<p>謂中國需用多量英國飛機</p>
<p>大陸報云、英政府於去年九月間、應當時駐華英使藍浦森之請、所派駐華英使署航空委員維洛克大尉、已於星期一日、乘郵船蘭浦拉號抵滬、現寓華　飯店、數日内將赴北平、然後再至滬埠設立辦公處、維氏此次猶爲第一次蒞華、據語大陸報訪員稱、行裝甫卸、故未能討論或發表對中國航空事業之計劃或意見、惟渠敢謂中國需用英國各式飛機、未可限量、故渠將殷切注意中國軍民航空事業未來之大進步云、按維洛克大尉、歐戰時服役於輕步兵隊、一九一五年改隸皇家飛行團、屢建功績、歐戰旣終、曾供職航空部、且與英國空防委員會有關云、</p>

<h3>中美試報不確</h3>
<p>陸課長對於昨日報載、該臺俟中英試報完竣後、將舉行中美試報等云云、認爲不確、且云中美間早已正式通報、無用試報、且中英通報之機件、係直放短波、僅可適用於中英間通報、絶對不可與美通報、至於中英通報後之價目、則與外商所訂之價目相同云、</p>

<h3>財部特派員爲金晳案上汪院長文事實上金之國籍已無異議即依日律亦無須明示允許</h3>
<p>金晳代理律師樓允梅昨上汪院長文云、汪院長鈞鑒、敬啓者、查金晳被日領事非法逮捕案、其詳細事實及交涉經過、業經專文呈請、諒蒙察核、惟頃奉稚先生函、以鈞長對此事、「難處在金晳自認已取得中國國籍、而日方則不承認金晳之脫離日國國籍爲有效、未來兩國國籍、最爲中日間關於韓人之爭執的焦點」云云、其論斷之正確、觀察之入微、詢難出其右、惟本件徵諸事實、金晳國籍問題、應無爭執、而衡諸法理、姑不問金晳有否脫離日國國籍、又在中國領土内居住、金晳之應歸中國法律制裁、絶無疑義、茲爲明瞭眞相便於交涉起見、就事實與法律縷陳如下、</p>
<h3>事實方面</h3>
<p>查金晳自民國十八年十月、隨同其父歸化中國後、首尾六載、均在中國上海設定居所、卽此已足爲中國國民之事實證明、而去年十一月金晳父子曾遭同樣之逮捕、當時我國政府、根據金晳之國籍許可證、向日方嚴重交涉、始允釋回、使日方不承認金晳脫離本國、歸化中國、何不於爾時提出國籍之爭執、而拒絶釋放、乃遲至現下、重發謬論、誠不解其用意之所在、故就事實論、金晳之國籍問題、巴有一度之確定、斷不能容其再有異議、損我主權、</p>
<h3>法律方面</h3>
<p>根據上開事實、姑不問日方於金晳之歸化中國、已有默認、而按照日本國籍法第二十條第一項、「依自己的志願、取得外國國籍者、喪失日本國籍」之規定、亦無須經日本政府之明示允許、而對於韓人出籍、又無特别之規定、是日本對國民之出籍、純採放任主義、而自中國法律觀之、僅有中國籍而已、揆諸國際法學上之通則、則此爲當然之論斷、卽退一步言、縱令金晳未經日政府准許、未能喪失日籍、然金晳固已合法取得中國國籍、充其量、亦祗能調爲取得兩重國籍耳、按一九三四年各國在海牙所簽訂之國籍法公約、其第五條規定、在第三國之領土内、有兩個以上之國籍者、應視爲祗有一個國籍、在不妨碍該國於身分事件法律之通用、及有效條約等範圍之内、該國就此人所有之各國籍中、應擇其通常或主要居所所在之國家之國籍、或在諸種情形之下、似與此人實際上關係、最切之國家之國籍而承認爲其惟一之國籍、」今金晳歸化中國後，全家居住上海已達六載、其實際上關係最切之國家、當然應認爲中國、假使金晳居於法國境内、猶應如此辦理、矧居住中國境内乎、依照上開律文之解釋、此爲當然之論斷、且金晳之爲中國國民、已有事實及日方之默認、足資證明、則按其居住之地域爲上海第二特區、當然應遵照關於上海法租界内設置中國法院之恊定辦理、乃竟忍心破壞、故中國對法領署之遺憾、實不次於日領也、基於上列說明、金晳之應爲中國國民、按照事實、衡諸法理、毫無疑問、應請鈞長察核、迅予向法日领署提起嚴重抗議交涉釋回、完我主權、肅此謹陳、祗請　安、律師樓允梅上、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>自然科學與社會（二）</h3>
<p>科學孰爲重要與需要？</p>
<p>｜答余萬望君（續）</p>
<p>至於說到挽救中國目前的危局我們應提倡那一種科學呢？這仍是執於形式之說，是從個人主觀的空想出發，没有把握住事實。中國目前的事實是一方面大衆應趕急學習社會科學，以應付當前加在大衆身上的歷史使命，改變現狀，開拓新的局面；一到舊的障礙除去，我們需要建設，我們急需要的是技術人才，自然科學知識。挽救中國是一個整個的工程，在這工程中雖然在前一階段（破壞舊的）與後一階段（建設新的）似乎有所偏重，如就整體言，缺一不可，不可分開。我們實在不能提倡那一種，放下那一種。因爲倘如此，就要落到空想裏去了。</p>
<p>總結一句，兩種科學都是中國社會的急需，挽救中國的工程中佔有同一重要而且不可分開的性質。</p>
<p>不過，在中國目前的狀况下對自然科學是無發展環境的。自然科學的發展，要受生產力所規定。中國目前生產力受着生產關係所束縛，卽無進展的可能，因此，在此園地裏，自然科學失掉它開花的條件了。縱你如何的提倡，幻想，一切都是無用的。没有巨大的工業基礎，同時也就没有爲這些工業而設備的研究室，試騐館，没有這些物質裝置，自然產不出科學家來。自然科學在今日的中國如此的不振，不是没有緣故的。</p>
<p>反之；社會科學今日已有了較發展的狀態，也有目前中國實踐之所賜，不是由於人的好惡，主觀的提倡。</p>
<p>因此，我們只能說，現在研究社會科學較自然科學有較好的條件；現在客觀的實際促起大衆都去研究社會科學了。</p>
<p>至於從個人方面講，應當研究那一種，那却完全是另一問題，不必牽涉到學科的本身是否重要上去。因爲我們學習某種科目，主要的是看我們的環境是否適合。假如你適合研究自然科學或社會科學，儘可不必問該科學是否重要，竟去埋首研究好了。但是你或許又以爲我們是模稜兩可，因爲適合於研究某種科學的環境又未說明。那我們可以具體地告訴你：假如你是一個富𤍠誠，肯服務，而同時又缺乏自然科學的基礎，與興趣的人，那就去研究社會科學好了；倘如你是一個很冷靜，具基礎又有適於作自然科學的物質條件，那你就去研究自然科學好了。不過，你若以爲這二種科學的研究是要具有二種不同的頭腦，却大錯特錯，完全誤解了我們的意思。我們所以這樣主張者是就個人的志願和社會的效果而言，至於研究學問所應具的態度或精神，則不論那種學科，都是一樣的。</p>
<p>再則，我們看你的來信，似乎側重到「出路」問題，因而聯想到學科的急需性上去。這問題我們却要更模稜兩可的答覆你：不論你學自然科學或社會科學，可是都無「出路」，都有「出路」。這理由不消說得，祗要你着眼看看現實社會上的情形就可明白。</p>
<p>現在將我們的主旨總括起來：（一）學問是没有重要與否之分的；（二）我們學習某種科目要由社會與個人的環境决定；（三）「出路」與學習科目無關。｜｜敬</p>

<h3>派</h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>羣而不黨，黨而不羣，在三代的時候，有「羣」有「黨」，但是没有「派」，在二十世紀裏，有「黨」無「羣」，但是有「派」。不知二十世紀裏的「派」，是否就是三代時候的所謂「羣」，這一重公案，怕就翻過了中西二十四史，也難在一個水落石出。因爲在魯豫諸省的古墓中，似乎也没發掘出過關於「羣」的掌故來。</p>
<p>「羣」「黨」且擱起了不談，我們且來談談這年頭兒最時髦的「派」。</p>
<p>在政治方面，有「左派」「右派」而還有左不左，右不右，尶尶𡯓𡯓的「中立派」。有「新派」「舊派」，同時還有新不新，舊不舊的「調和派」。所以不派則已，有了派，便不免鼎足而三。但是在美國，有主張禁酒的「乾派」，有主張開酒禁的「濕派」，却没有乾不乾，濕不濕的「騎墻派」。這是一個例外。</p>
<p>在我們中國，却更覺有趣。大鑼大鼓，蹦蹦跳跳的京劇，自然是歸於「古派」。不跳，不唱，不開花臉的文明戲，自然是算「新派」。但是在這二派之間，却另有一派，古不古，新不新的，不呌「中立派」，「調和派」，或是「騎墻派」，而别出心裁，呌做「海派」。這雖也在劇界裏三分了天下，但名爲「海派」，似乎對於其餘派，有些風馬牛。</p>
<p>練把式的，有「武當派」，「少林派」，但是第三派，却又别樹一幟，呌做「江湖派」。說起這個「江湖派」，倒是一個包羅萬象的集團。捉牙虫算命，是「江湖派」，駱駝醫病，也是「江湖派」。有錢花錢，没錢的綳綳塲面，果然是「江湖派」，袴襠裏玩出大金魚缸來，也是「江湖派」。三敎九流十八調，無一不可歸入「江湖派」，「江湖派」自然不只代表練把式者。這便是表示着「派」的組成，在我們中國，是「另有一派」，非紅毛鬼，直脚鬼等等……所得而望其項背者也。</p>
<h3>中西音樂</h3>
<p>— 施瑛</p>
<p>「我雖不及師矌之聰，聞絃歌而知雅意。」周瑜的話眞妙！咱們自然没有周郎的聰明，但是瞧瞧（非聽）中西音樂，雅意也　味兒了！</p>
<p>▼胡琴與梵和琳　胡琴跟梵和琳，全是絃樂。可是玩梵和琳的，是聲傾四座的音樂大家，是詩人，是音樂專校敎授；玩胡琴的，是唱春的漢子，伴姑娘出局的烏師，頑童和不良少年。並非胡琴比不上梵和琳。梵和琳是外國東西，外國的該走運；胡琴總算歸化了的國產，中國的該倒霉。</p>
<p>▼花鼓與跳舞　街頭，閒人打起圈子，中間一方空地，幾個穿紅着綠的女人，在扭着腰肢跳，在尖着嗓子唱，輕鑼，鼓在敲，大人先生鄙夷地笑，老總們來，還得罰錢和驅逐，花鼓有傷風化。但是披霞諾可風頭健，放在富麗的跳舞廳裏，悠揚地彈奏起來，一對對神仙似的舞侶，在光滑的地板上跳舞。樂而不淫，哀而不傷，跳舞才是高尙的娱樂。因爲花鼓是中國的；而披霞諾是西方的。</p>
<p>▼中文與英文　中文的歌詞也該倒霉，唱中文歌的是小學生，唱蓮花落的是呌化子，哼毛毛雨的要遭禁止，在正人君子前唱小調凖會挨巴掌。可是，大學生愛哼英文名歌；所謂Harmony的四部合奏，也跟蓮花落的和聲相差無幾，然而四部合奏用於莊嚴的禮堂中；至於西文的求愛曲，像有名的「我怎能别你」，非但没人禁止，而且有人提倡啊。</p>
<h3>四曼殊</h3>
<p>— 春柳</p>
<p>曼殊，就是所謂文殊，佛典中的人物也；也有人附會到二百年前，滿洲立國時，所以取名「滿洲國」，乃是曼殊的轉音，愛新覺羅的祖先，想借佛力定其國基，似乎是不經人談。</p>
<p>自從驚才絶艶的蘇曼殊在文壇露面以來，一般人對於曼殊兩字，更感覺到一種玄秘的意味，好像此名更雅。以我所知道，並世實有四曼殊。除香山蘇曼殊外，還有兩個和尙，也名曼殊，一是最近在廣州白雲山被逐的，是四川人，曾入支那内學院，與陳銘樞同爲宜黃歐陽漸的門弟子。他愛冩屏對送人，南京鷄嗚寺樓上，便有他冩的四扇屏幅，大書四峨嵋山僧曼殊。一是興化人，曾在南京毘盧寺掛單，有六十多歲年紀，也愛吟幾首詩，實在没有什麽詩味。</p>
<p>此外還有滿洲人曼殊，曾做過一部天咫偶聞，專冩北京舊時風物，文筆是很淸麗可喜的，不過年代要比這三位曼殊遠一點吧了。</p>
<h3>月夜</h3>
<p>— 偉中</p>
<p>晚上，挾着寂寞的心緒，獨自步上五臺上。</p>
<p>皎皎的月光，飄飄然照着，很亮，很恬靜，似春夜一樣。可是秃了頂的枝頭，和一片萎黃的草地，又分明吿訴了這已是初冬時候。</p>
<p>五臺山並不怎樣高，嚴格講來，還祗算得一個土阜而已。周圍有着高深的叢林密集的掩蔽着。山頂上，躺着一片很矌野的草地，寂寂然。幽閒。淡泊，似一個鄕村裏的閨女；而况更有初十頭邊的新月，蛾眉樣彎彎的，在明澈的天際，遍　伊的淸輝。</p>
<p>這裏信置在首都市區的中心地帶，論理該有多少膩煩了都市繁華生活的市民們，需要這個幽靜的地方，躺進大自然的懷抱中，享受那偉大的撫摩呢！然而除了我的影單形雙以外，此地更不復有個人影，美影良辰，竟安排給這個孤獨的流浪者所獨自消受？</p>
<p>深靛色的村莊，稀落落在夜色中偃臥着，偶然有一二星星的燎光，在田舍間閃爍。</p>
<p>夫子廟：電影院裏也許正映着醉人的爵士歌王，天韻樓頭也許正唱着迷心的游龍戲鳳！一般王孫公子，此刻正沈醉在歌聲舞影中吧！</p>
<p>探海燈的强烈電光，似一條矯健游龍，含着極大野心，在四野裏搜索它的侵</p>
<p>略的目的一般，從下關帝國主義的兵艦上，不絶的橫掃過來。</p>
<p>驀然似有些兒人聲，自左角上傳來，繞過一排樹，月色淡淡下，草亭裏一對年靑的男女並肩兒坐着。</p>
<p>颯颯的寒風，峭然吹着。</p>
<p>｜冷麽？愛的！</p>
<p>｜不，我絲毫不覺得呀！</p>
<p>温存的寒暄，散在寂寂的夜氣中，十分輕盈又十分美妙。沙女抵下頭，望着面前一大片荒凉的草地，草地上，月光濃霧，混成一色，白濛濛地飄蕩着。</p>
<p>一切都沈默的。然而這是沈默的時候麽？</p>
<p>｜｜多美的月夜呀！</p>
<p>看着｜慢慢的一隻手兒灣了過去，手和手握着，靑春的火燄在一對年靑人的心底熊熊燃着，兩個身軀挪動了，兩個靈魂在一處跳動，兩個人緊緊的擁抱了！</p>
<p>這是一種多麽尖刻的示威啊！於一個孤獨的流浪者。按起中傷的創口，從刺斜裏的小徑上，偷偷地溜了回來。</p>
<p>愛的驕子呀，祝你們永遠幸福吧！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十回絮語燈前苦心訓弱息杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>趙翁聽他說的那一番話，以爲他看到平臺上那幾個被人戲弄的女子，所以發生一番議論。現在越說就牢騷越大，把他自己也捲入了漩渦，分明是有所指而發，這可令人有些不解了，於是望了他笑道；甘二爺，你也爲着什麽戀愛的事失敗了嗎？積之這才有些省悟，自己所求不得的女人，便是這位老翁的兒媳婦，怎好明白的說了出來，便笑着搖了兩搖頭道：談不上，談不上！這話一說一了，不必提了，咱們坐着喝一點兒，看紅葉罷。他不這樣說時，趙翁還以爲是略略猜到一點，於今他不願向下深提，趙翁就明白這裏面有了莫大的秘密。談是自然不談，心裏對於這一件事可就不能忘記了。</p>
<h3>第二十三回</h3>
<p>創痛難堪凝神聽鼓樂歡情未洽促别到飛符</p>
<p>在這個時候，積之心裏頭，有些省悟過來自己口舌太快了，怎好在人家公公面前；爲了他兒媳的事情，發起牢騷來呢。於是這就向趙翁笑道；老太爺，剛才我是發了神經病，您不必信那些話。年紀輕的人，自己有了女人，就會發生許多風潮。没有女人呢，看到了别人的女人，自己可又會紅眼。他不辨白，趙翁已是疑心，他辨白之後，趙翁更是疑心了，將一張帶了皺紋的長臉漲紅了想來，就是那皮膚裏面隠藏的幾個白麻子，也都烘托着顯了出來了。（二九三）</p>

<p>在這個村子裏，没有誰認識他，也没有誰知道他是從什麽地方來的。他兩眼睛了，呆定了的眼球，白裏泛着一圈一圈的靑，正如我們在魚盤裏所見到的死魚的眼睛，完全呆定了的。</p>
<p>他最初來時是住在一個破土地廟裏，後來被收留於劉莊，但不久又送回了土地廟。原因是劉莊裏的四先生發現他的山東口音，而盤詰他的來歷，他一個字也不肯說，只是粗暴地問着四先生和其他一切人：</p>

<p>四先生驚奇地問道：「誰是馬珂里沙？馬珂里沙是誰？他於你有什麽關係？」</p>
<p>他默然了，而且微笑，微笑裏是充滿了諷刺和傲慢的光尖。四先生忍着氣，給了他一頓滿足的午餐，想從這善寬的待遇裏套出他的一些眞實話，但他在吃飽了後，捫着肚子，還是這樣的問：</p>
<p>「你們有誰做做好事，吿訴我吧｜｜馬珂里沙還活着嗎？」</p>
<p>四先生便將他送回了土地廟，說：「你不能呌我知道你是什麽人，就是不敢帮助你的。」</p>
<p>他並不反抗這樣的待遇，他微笑地回了土地廟，找得了他以前睡覺的龕肚，靜靜地自己躺下。</p>
<p>每天有一定的時間，他出來討飯。他用一件髒破的掛着一團團爛絮的袍子把身子裹了起來，手裏拿着的一根明杖，是用不滿兩尺長的松樹枝做的。</p>
<p>他留神聽一切過路人的足音，他有特殊的智慧能分别出每一種足音是屬於什麽人的，他有時伸出另外一隻空閒的手，攔住他理想中的善人，但他並不討索錢而是激切地說道：</p>
<p>「先生，吿訴我，馬珂里沙還活着嗎？」</p>
<p>人是很煩厭地推開了他，快步地走了過去，或者在他的手上，給他留下一個銅板，吿訴他：「我之不知道馬珂里沙是誰，正如不知道你是誰一樣」。</p>
<p>於是他悲傷地縮回了手，翻着那兩隻白果式的眼睛，回到原來站立的地方，慘默地笑了一笑。</p>
<p>一直到他巡遍了這村子，幾乎没有一個人，不被他這馬珂里沙的詢問麻煩了以後，他正式去拜訪劉莊的四先生，要求他供給他以最後一次的乾量，並且說明他卽刻要離開這村子。</p>
<p>「你將要繼續打聽你的馬珂里沙下落去嗎。」</p>
<p>四先生問他。</p>
<p>「是的，我找他。我已找尋了他五年了，我還可以再找他五年。在我這殘餘的痛苦的生命裏，只有他可以救我……」</p>
<p>四先生意外地聰明了起來，急速地詢問他道：「救你！我知道了；他是一個外國眼科醫生嗎？」</p>
<p>「一個眼科醫生，是的，而且是傳敎士，我們村子裏的徐老九，他這樣吿訴我的，他親眼看見這外國醫生在麻城治好了兩個瞎子，他只從那白銀打的瓶子裏倒出一點黃水，洗在他們的眼皮上，不到三天，就都能看人了，那外國活神仙是不要我們酬謝的，也許只要我入敎……我願意，我已學會了，唱聖歌，如果他肯醫</p>
<p>治我的眼睛，我是什麽都可以犠牲的。」</p>
<p>聽見這神奇的話，四先生更覺興奮了起來，本於懷疑的他留冒失失地說道：「我是十分奇怪，我也到過麻城，不但没有聽見有這樣的眼科醫生，甚至於像馬珂里沙，這名字我也很生疎的，你能够相信徐老九，是不會哄騙你的嗎？）（未完）</p>

<h3>京派與海派</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>沈從文先生在大公報文藝副刋三十二期，暢論海派文人的醜態。說：「名士才情」與「商業競賣」相結合，便成立了吾人今日對於海派這個名詞的槪念。……試爲引申之、「投機取巧」，「見風轉舵」，……這就是所謂海派；邀集若干新斯文人、相聚一堂、或遠談希臘羅馬，或近談文士女人，……從官方拿到了點錢、則吃吃喝喝、辦什麽文藝會，招納子弟，哄騙讀者，……也就是所謂海派。感情主義的左傾，勇如獅子，一看情形不對時，卽刻自首投降，且指認栽害友人，邀功侔利，也就是所謂海派。因渴慕出名，在作品以外去利用種種方法招搖……也就是所謂海派。』結末說：『妨害新文學健康處，使文學本身軟弱無力，使社會上一般人對於文學失去牠必需的認識，且常歪曲文學的意義，又使若干正擬從事於文學的靑年，不知務實努力，以爲名士可慕，不努力冩作却先去做作家，便皆爲這種海派的風氣作家。』海派之罪大惡極至此，雖用最黑的咒語詛咒牠滅亡，亦不爲過。</p>
<p>然而，今日之「京派」有以異於「海派」乎？「京派」和「海派」本來是中國戲劇上的名詞，京派不妨說是古典的，海派也不妨說是浪漫的；京派如大家閨秀，海派則如摩登女郎。「吾友」辛祖歛先生論北平與上海，說「京派的藝術家有梅博士足以代表，海派的藝術家則劉大師當仁不讓。」若大家閨秀可嘲笑摩登女郎賣弄風騷，則摩登女郎亦可反唇譏笑大家閨秀爲時代落伍。梅博士若笑劉大師賣野人頭，劉大師必斥梅博士不懂文藝復興。試就京派之現狀申論之，胡適博士，京派之俊佼者也，也講哲學史，也談文學革命，也辦獨立評論，也奔波保定路上，有以異於沈從文先生所謂投機取巧者乎？曰：無以異也。海派冒充風雅，或遠談希臘羅馬，或近談文士女人；而京派則獨攬風雅，或替擺倫出百週紀念千週紀念，或調寄「秋興」十首百首律詩，關在玻璃房裏，和現實隔絶；彼此有以異乎？曰無以異也。海派文人從官方拿到了點錢，辦什麽文藝會，招納子弟，吃吃喝喝；京派文人，則從什麽文化基金會拿到了點錢，狂逛海外，談談文化；彼此有以異乎？曰無以異也。「一成爲文人，便無足觀」，天下烏鴉一般黑，固無間乎「京派」與「海派」也。</p>
<p>所以，海派文人百無一是，固矣。然而穿高跟鞋的摩登女郎，在街頭往來，在市塲往來，在公園往來，她們總是社會的，和社會相接觸的。那些裹着小脚，躱在深閨的小姐，不當對之有愧色嗎？沈從文先生要呌京派來掃蕩海派，只怕言之過早呢！我看明日的批評家，决不站在京派的營壘，只對於海派在漠視與輕視以上取掃蕩的態度，應當英勇地掃蕩了海派，也掃蕩了京派，方能開闢新文藝的路來！</p>
<p>中國今日還没有大作家，也没有大批評家；寂寞的文壇，也不容許批評家露臉，此起居注派所以風行一時也！嗚乎！</p>
<h3>藝術之「超道德性」</h3>
<p>— 唐雋</p>
<p>这裏所說的「道德」，是指「倫理家」，「法律家」，或「聖經」所認定的「道德」而言。</p>
<p>本來，這個問題，在歐洲早已不成爲問題了，可是中國的文化，老不長進，中國的近代的藝術運動，雖也有了一二十年的歷史，但到現在，一般人對於「裸體藝術」還不能有一個正確的，適當的認識。幷且聽到友人說：「裸體藝術」現在還受着社會的種種非難，因之，便禁不住想抓着這舊題目來饒舌一下。</p>
<p>「道德」這兩個字，在常識界已經是代表着一個不甚確切，異常惝恍迷離的東西。在藝術界裏，更早就變了原來的形像｜｜「倫理家」，「法律家」，「聖經」等所定的形像。譬如殺人爲不道德，而劊子手殺那定了死刑的犯人，是道德的。打壁折牆爲不道德，而一些土木工人在一個終了的大博覽會塲中，拆牆打壁，以至於毁壞一切富麗輝煌的房屋，則是道德的。再拿波得勒（Baudelaire）「惡德」的表現，左拉（Zola）之「瘋狂」與「困苦」的描冩，羅丹（Rodin）之「翹足張陰」的裸體女性雕像等等來看，都早將定型的道德打得粉碎！他們的作品旣都獲得千士不滅的價値，可見道德在藝術上，已失掉了重要性，而成爲一種無意義的東西了！</p>
<p>一般淺識者流，多把藝術「題材」的道德或不道德，拿來作藝術批評的根據，這實在是非常妄誕！他們因爲某種宗敎題材，或戰爭題材的作品，可以把世人引入宗敎的理想和信仰，以及尙武精神或非戰觀念等，便說藝術的價値，都在這類道德的題材中。他們因爲某種「𤍠愛」，「狂慾」，「强暴」，「偷盜」或其他種種「惡德」的描冩，或許有把人誘入歧途的危險，便說這種不道德的誘惑，卽是藝術身價没落的原因。這些都是一般道貌儼然的「倫理家」，以及口裏誦着聖經的「敎士」們所呐喊的口號。</p>
<p>然而，藝術品不是一種「修身課」｜｜「倫理學」，也不是一部「法律」，或一本「聖經」。「藝術家」不是一個「倫理家」，一個「律師」，或一個「敎士」；又怎麽可以拿一般的模型去比擬他呢！</p>
<p>藝術家没有勸人爲善的義務，也没有誘人爲惡的意慾。他們不在題材的道德與不道德上，顯示他們的本領，他們却在創作的加緊的努力上，來發現他們自己，來認識出與他們自己相似的别人。他們直率地，坦白地，一無隠飾地，把他們所感受的，不管是「𤍠狂」，「嫉妬」，「偷盜」，「奸淫」………盡量的描劃出來，便算完事。外界「感受」和「影響」的結果怎樣，不是他們所計及的！他們旣不要人稱頌他們是「聖哲」，是「天才」；他們也不怕人的「冷笑」，「譏評」，和「咒駡」。</p>
<p>總而言之，一般人所認爲重要的「道德性」，在藝術上是没有絲毫的力量的。</p>
<h3>夢囈</h3>
<p>— 繆崇羣</p>
<p>夜靜的時候，我反常常地不能睡眠。枯澀的眼睛，睜着疼，閉着也疼，橫竪睜着閉着都是一樣的在黑暗裏。我不要看見什麽了，光明曾經傷害了我的眼睛，並且曝露了我的一切的惡劣的行跡。</p>
<p>白晝，我的心情煩躁，比誰都不能安寗，爲了一點小小事故，我　駡，我咆哮，有時甚或摔過一個茶盅，接着又去摜碎兩支玻璃杯子。我漲紅了臉，喘着氣。我不管鄰人是否在隔壁訕笑，直等發作完了，心裏才稍稍覺得有點平息。</p>
<p>說不出什麽是對象，一無長物的我，只伴着一個和我患着同樣痛疾的妻：她也是没有一點比我更幸福的運命：操勞着，受難着，用着殘餘的氣力去掙扎：雖然早晨吃粥晚上吃粥，但難於得來的還就是作粥所需要的米。</p>
<p>我咆哮的時候是没有理由，然而妻在一邊陰自啜泣，不知怎麽又引起了我的暴虐的詛咒。</p>
<p>追求光明的人，才原是没有光明的人；</p>
<p>現在，黑夜到來了，鄰人的鼾聲，像牛吼一般的從隔壁傳來，它示着威，使我從心底發着火一般的妬忌，可是無可奈何地祇有自己在床上輾轉，輕輕地，又唯恐擾醒了身旁的妻。</p>
<p>｜｜一個可憐的女人！我彷彿在心裏暗暗念着她的名字，安息的時候你是安息了。忘掉了白晝的事罷，生活在黑暗裏的人們也就不知道什麽呌黑暗了。</p>
<p>不時地，妻忽然夢囈了。模模糊糊地說着斷續的句子，帶着她苦心的自白和傷怨的調子，每一個字音，像都是對我有一種絶大的刺戟。</p>
<p>我凝神地傾着耳，我一個字也不能辯地自己懺悔了，虔誠地懺悔了。</p>
<p>夢囈是她的心靈的話語，她不知道的她的長期沉鬱着的心靈是在黑暗中和我對話了。</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>「醒醒！醒醒！」被妻喚醒過來，我還聽見自己哭泣的餘音。我摸一摸潮濕了的臉，我没有說什麽。</p>
<p>因爲妻也没有問什麽，倒使我非常難堪了。她不知道她的夢囈曾使我的心靈懺悔，但她也不知道白晝以丑角的身份出現於人間舞台而黑夜作婦人的啜泣的人又是怎麽一回事的。</p>
<h3>韋爾斯的預言：一九三五年中日大戰記（續）</h3>
<p>— 孟眞</p>
<p>於是日本漸漸來了戰爭的疲勞。農民只看見他的兒子從軍外出，却不見回家。加上一般物資的缺乏，壯丁的稀少，遂發生災荒。當一九三五年時本已有過强烈的停戰運動。以後，名古屋發生了幾次的罷工，死傷數百人。日本爲了要向海外購買軍需品，有現金的必要，於是竭力對外傾銷。但是除此以外，現在如加拿大美國的穀麥，澳洲的肉類，都已成爲日本的必要了。戰爭這樣使日本國内發生恐慌。也使中國的生產能力大半化爲烏有。當歐洲戰爭時，德國曾經有過一個經濟的奇蹟，然而日本的社會構造太原始了，要像德國那樣與困難相奮鬥，到底不可能，日本的債劵，這樣價格不絶下落。甚至提供了一分四至一分五的高利，也借不到欵子。可是戰爭却依舊没有終結的形勢。</p>
<p>日本軍閥到了欲罷不能的地步了。人民對於戰爭的咒咀，一天天的激烈起來了。美俄及歐洲各國，目光灼灼的凝視着。日本爲欲打開這個窮盡孤立的難關，於是决意求最後的一逞，以大軍侵入中原地方｜｜湖北。日本經過了巨大的凖備，把凡能作戰的人民都調上了戰線。日本這個軍事計畫，是欲「打擊中國的心臟」。於是從南京，山東，廣東三方面，向湖北集中。日本的軍隊所以分這三面，是欲盡量　發中國鄕村的物質。</p>
<p>這時，鐵道的交通，很難保持。且大部都是没有，交通非常不便。所以當日本軍隊通過湖北省境之時，其全軍之三分之一，不得不像長蛇樣，從事軍用道路的修築。在這樣的交通狀態之下，自然日本所能運來以攻擊湖北的輕重砲隊，比之中國軍隊也不能好到多少了。况且中國軍的背後，有四川豐富的資源並歐美的援助呢。</p>
<p>日本這三枝軍隊，最後乃包圍武昌。這像一個寬鬆的環，曾有一時漸趨緊迫，但是不久却就停止了。這是因爲將士疲憊到了極點的結果。所以在揚子江的上下一帶，日本的大包圍始終没有成功。一九三八年的新年到來了，日本國内等着勝利的戰報。但是從新月形的長壕中，却什麽都没有消息。這樣空過了一年。</p>
<p>就在一九三八年的七月間，日本軍中發生了赤痢與黑死病。疫勢非常利害，使日本的軍醫雖用盡能力，仍舊不克奏効。所以自一九三九年初起，日本就開始向南京退軍。因爲交通通路，到處遇到擾亂，損失很爲重大。日本軍退却的眞相，直到現在尙有得而知。總之，二百餘萬的大軍，退軍南京時，健全無恙者不及半數。飢餓所加於日本軍的打擊，實比中國軍隊與人民的襲擊更爲利害。因疲餓至極，多相率倒斃於退却的路上。當時日本兵士所以少爲俘虜的原因，便是因爲中國軍中没有糧食以養俘虜之故。日本軍隊這樣以飢餓，疲勞，惡疫的襲擊，退到南京，人數不過十萬了。沿途到處都累累是兵士的屍身，蒲圻，蘄州一帶，尙存着巨塚，而以大洪水故，有許多兵士給沈没於河流之底。</p>
<p>殘餘的日本軍隊，退到南京不久，就發生兵變，槍殺軍官，與自中國杭州方面過來的紅軍相合。此時，日本已與美國交戰，國内民衆因爲生活困苦之故，都起而爲亂，大阪，名古屋諸大都市，皆落於共產黨之手。</p>
<p>日美邦交的破裂，是由於美國供給潛艇，水雷等軍火與中國，日本曾一再提出抗議。自勃海灣頭日本的運送船爲所擊沈以來，兩國感情日趨險惡，戰爭遂成爲不可避免的事。（未完）</p>

<p>他取下一隻瓶子，數說那裏面所盛的樂物的性質，隨後第二隻，隨後第三隻，他簡直作了一番治療法的講授，大家也像是很注意的在聽着。</p>
<p>羅蘭搖着腦袋說：</p>
<p>「這很有趣嗎！」</p>
<p>有人輕輕地在敲門。</p>
<p>「請進來！」華爾呌着。</p>
<p>於是博齊汝船長出現了。</p>
<p>他一面伸出手來握手一面說：</p>
<p>「我因爲不願打擾你們，所以來得遲了。」</p>
<p>他也祗好坐在床上。於是沉默又開始了。</p>
<p>可是，博齊汝船長突然凝神聽着。他隔着艙板聽到了外面凖備開船的號令，他報吿道：</p>
<p>「假使我們要乘着「珍珠」號釣船看着你出口，並在大海上和你吿别的話，那麽我們便該動身了。」</p>
<p>羅蘭是把這事看得很要緊的，無疑的他是想引起「洛蘭勒」上面的乘客的注意，他連忙站起身說道：</p>
<p>「那麽，再會罷，我的孩子。」</p>
<p>他和筆爾抱吻着，他吻在筆爾的頰髯上，隨後便把房門開了。</p>
<p>羅蘭媽媽一動也不動，低垂着兩眼，面色異常蒼白。</p>
<p>她的丈夫　着她的臂膀說：</p>
<p>「好啦，快點罷，我們一分鐘都不能够遲延。」</p>
<p>她立起身，向她的兒子走上一步，把她那白蠟似的兩頰一面一面地伸給他，他一句話也没說，一面吻了一下。隨後他和陸醉米太太握了握手，又和他的弟弟握着手問道：</p>
<p>「你什麽時候舉行婚禮？」</p>
<p>「現在還没有十分决定。我們會趁着　　當你轉回哈佛爾的時期舉行　。」</p>

<p>紗花</p>
<h3>標紗花難跟美棉上騰</h3>
<p>紗市晨漲午跌、但海外棉市雖漲、而銀價有放長消息、人心仍難提高、市上實需依然平靜、各路以經濟困苦、購買力薄弱、所以新買者甚缺、不過棉市趨漲、廠方殊覺艱難、</p>
<h3>人標新買缺乏</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、以印美棉市趨漲、買氣稍熾、各月漲六·七·九·角、午後聞現紗銷路不多、市盤又轉下落、各月跌三·七·角至一元、全日成交統計一萬二千三百包、查賣出仁豐六百五十包、德記三百包、裕康六百包、長豐七百包、泰昌四百包、愼記三百五十包、買進同和五百包、信誠一千一百包、長餘三百五十包、瑞大一千二百包、吉豐六百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉市始漲繼跌、美棉漲風頗熾、印棉亦步塵於後、市氣當有上漲之力、不過匯兌放長、紗市不振、且遠月迫近四十三元左右、新抛者稍有興味、同時多頭亦獲利了結、所以市盤反見鬆懈、惟甬帮吸收之額、尙未放出云、</p>

<h3>美棉狂跳四十餘磅音</h3>

<h3>標粉高騰期麥淸堅</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、均見高騰之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲一元二三角、坎拿大漲六七角左右、幷因報載美總統提高物價、已有成算、故開價後、人心均爲震動、價卽無形提漲、幷因大户多頭、仍繼續吸收近遠期、以致市氣尤形鋒俏、迨至下午開盤、近遠期人心、更進一步、本月份漲一角九分二厘半、較前日漲三分半、各月份亦較上午好一分、後以一部分廠家、微有出檔、且天津現貨售價、亦見平平、兵船因貨小開三角、砲車開二角半、致人心亦轉緩和也、結果本月份較前日漲二分半、二月份漲一分七厘半、三四月份漲一分半、五月份漲一分七厘半、六月份漲一分半、</p>
<p>麥市上下午開盤後、各月份市面、已轉俏利、不過各盤交易、依然淸淡已極、半因籌碼不多、半因投機减退、故市氣雖因洋麥之高漲、以及粉市之轉昂、略爲帶起、交易則仍空拍居多也、結果本月份未開、二月份好五分、三月份好七分、其餘均無開出、現麥因標凖轉好、貨客扳售、故未做開、</p>

<p>油市</p>
<h3>白桐油漢市回跌</h3>
<p>｜洪秀油在申開盤｜</p>
<p>白桐油上週因漢口洋莊數頓旺、市面卽起漲風、每擔由二十三元加至二十五元、經此漲後、而洋行又復歛手、適各產地新貨正在旺出之際、漢市到貨當然不少、洋莊一經緩辦、市面卽趨沉寂、價格亦日漸低落、據前日漢電已跌至二十二元七角、漲風旣速、回跌亦猛、而尙有續跌趨勢、觀其形勢、恐一十二元、卽在目前、浙桐亦在旺產、前幾日曾依據漢市、售至每擔二十元零三四角、杭江干交貨、一現曇花、卽成陳蹟、茲復回至十九元三四角、本埠各號此次共辦、幾及萬擔、現因市面萎靡、亦均止手不辦、然存積已不弱矣、秀油萬興裕、素號尖秀、於前日開出三四百桶、價爲二十九元七八角、尙有大有恒集豐恒照例降盤、洪江桐油集　盈亦開二十二元、約千桶左右、祥泰豐聞由各號暗中開進、且已如數揭罄、</p>

<h3>新鉛絲銷路興旺</h3>
<p>新鉛絲近來閩浙當局、均有採辦、故成交甚爲興旺、查昨開出達五六百擔之多、購户則多爲軍界採辦、花色則多爲八號十號十二號十四號等數種、至十六號至二十五號等花色殊少點綴、行情因年關迫近、故無提漲消息云、</p>
<h3>純銻破進三百元關口</h3>
<p>純銻近來交易、無大進展、但到貨充斥、存積富厚、所以人心奇疲、故行情已破進三百元關、計每噸售二百九十八元、比前又跌二元、交易印書房鉛字房等稍有問津、别帮殊無染指者云、</p>

<h3>歐美絲電不轉</h3>
<p>（紐約現絲存積益鉅）紐約各絲織廠去冬綢銷不振、生絲消用大减、年底存絲頗厚、　歲以來、日絲進口仍旺、各綢襪廠節制生產、縮减工作、致市上現絲存積益鉅、昨晨美絲商接得紐約一月上旬絲市電報、全市現存生絲（截至一月十日止）達十二萬零九百三十七包、其間日本絲占十一萬包弱、華絲五千零三十九包、意法等國絲五千餘包、</p>
<p>（綢商乘賤抛購廠經）海外市塲生絲供過於求、各絲織廠存絲足敷需求、進胃毫無、歐美絲電均不見轉、洋莊絲銷疲滯如故、僅内地綢門春銷發動、鑒於白廠經價已跌至最低限度、遂乘賤抛購、昨由潯震滬等處綢商進B級現貨九十包、法莊亦進二十包、聞係點品交易、價仍平疲、</p>
<h3>摩洛哥茶市報跌</h3>
<p>據摩洛哥最近消息稱、現下該處綠茶市面、異常疲滯、中國路莊土莊平水綠茶、存積不下四萬餘箱、日本茶亦有二萬箱、因日茶廉價競銷、我國珍眉珠茶、每擔比前均挫跌三十餘法郎、因此英法茶商、對於業務前途、咸抱緊縮態度、致滬市土莊陳綠茶、完全無人問及云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「閹潮」</h3>
<p>— 立齊</p>
<p>在大戰前夜的一九三四年，生殖器却一躍而爲國際的重要「尤物」！其初，希特拉先生爲了减少小國民犯罪與「優種」之故，在德國强制消滅了許多人的生殖機能，不久又爲了執法之故，將一位强奸幼女的德人施以去勢之刑。最近，又有美國密雪根州，有男女兒童近千人，被消減生殖機能，因有誘致兒童父母簽字等情，頗引起一般人的攻擊。無論其爲並不妨害性慾的消滅生殖機能，抑或爲「連根一㧞」的去勢，但總是屬於性器官之局部或全部的閹割。所以我就統而謂之曰「閹潮」。</p>
<p>基於「優種學」的觀點來贊許消滅生殖機能者，定然大有其人，同時，依據「其無後乎」之人道主義的觀點來反對消滅生殖機能者，也一定頗不乏人。但是，我以爲無論其爲贊成或反對，都是會把握住問題的中心。因爲問題的癥結，並不在閹割的利弊，而在這種蔚爲風氣的閹割所反映之没落期間的帝國主義的政治魔術。</p>
<p>第一，在各帝國主義國家間，對於人們施以連根㧞的閹割或部分的消滅生殖機能，不外是爲了懲戒犯罪，杜絶犯罪者的傳播「壞種」和患有惡疾者之蕃殖「劣種」。關於疾病和某種劣根性的遺傳，固然是事實，但是現社會之一般的犯罪，惡疾，則大半由於社會制度的不良有以致之。工銀奴隸制度和「自掘墳墓」的經濟恐慌，都是隨時隨地，在壓迫人們去賣淫或挺而走險。換言之，現實社會根本就是一個製造男盜女娼的社會，而梅毒或其傳染病，却成爲「都市文明」的附產物。所以，人類的犯罪或傳染惡疾，都是隨時有受社會之賜的可能，大半並不從他或她的嚴慈之「敦倫」中得來也。現在希特拉之流和美國的政治家和法學家們，却故意抺煞了社會經濟結構的根本癥結，專門從禁止病人或「壞人」</p>
<p>傳種入手，顯然是一種「目能察秋毫而不見輿薪」的假痴呆，非騙局而何？</p>
<p>第二，資產階級對於自己周身的疾病，起先是惡疾諱醫，後來整個潰爛，實在不能隠瞞時，就抓住一兩個浮現在表面而又無關重輕的瘡疤，大吹大擂，像煞有介事地來表示自己在「醫病」，相當的治標和改良一下，藉以騙騙社會的被壓迫者，顯出那些總理部長之羣的「醫國手」，是畢竟還有點能耐的。希特拉和美國紳士們，近來一面用消滅生殖機能的方法來禁止「病種」和「壞種」的流傳，一面奬勵「佳種」的生殖，其對於改進國家社會之實際的作用，也就恰等於抓了一個瘡疤來齊醮熏沐，大貼膏藥，至於那整個潰爛透頂的梅毒，却放在「慢慢交」之例。這就是資產階級醫國手們的根本特徵，他們决不會對於「國病」開出「治本」之方案的，因爲一涉及治本，就得首先否定他們自己。</p>
<p>第三，現在正是世界戰爭的前夜，列强政治巨頭之羣，在思想和行動方面都限於重大的矛盾。爲了製造大批健壯的砲灰起見，帝國主義都不約而同地奬勵生殖。但同時又抺煞了生產無政府狀態之根本的病源，以爲不景氣和戰爭危機之襲來，是由於「人口過剩」之所致，因而大家都幻想使中下層社會的人停止傳種，就可以消弭戰禍而致「太平」，所以帝國主義者又要消滅許多成人和兒童的生殖機能。把閹潮和奬勵結婚合併起來觀察，我們可以看出陷於重大矛盾之中的帝國主義者們，現在已由狼狽而進到「狐埋狐扒」！</p>
<p>戳穿了西洋鏡，蔓延歐美的「閹潮」，不過是帝國主義政治家們所表演的新幻術之一種而已。</p>
<p>據美國密雪根州某醫院的醫生說：許多兒童之被消滅生殖機能，都是因爲「性慾旺盛」而發生病態之故。站在「中學爲體，西學爲用」的觀點，我倒贊成把這種科學的手術應用到中國軍閥官僚的身上，因爲不是性慾過旺，他們怎麽討了那多姨太太，還要額外擇𧰟而噬呢？</p>
<h3>逃難行乞</h3>
<h3>「防」誰的「癆」？</h3>
<p>— 雪菲</p>
<p>最近上海有所謂「預防癆病恊會」的發起。他們說，全世人口，以十萬人爲單位，我國每年死於癆病者，就有三百零七人，六倍於紐西蘭，四倍於埃及與美國，三倍半於德國，三倍於英國，二倍半於西班牙，二倍於義國，一倍半於法國及日本云。以數字論，這却是可驚的中國的癆病死亡率了。自然，預防癆病，在這時我國是急不容緩的。</p>
<p>可是，預防誰的癆病呢？卽是說，中國那一部分人患癆病的最多，又去替那一部分人預防癆病呢？我首先要提出這個問題。這是一個中國預防癆病的先决問題。這個問題若不解决，什麽防癆運動，恐最後都會是一無結果的。</p>
<p>我們知道，癆病的來源，一是工作過度，二是營養不良，三是空氣不潔。特别是工作不良，對於體弱的人，最易發生癆病。那末，中國那一部分人最易發生癆病呢？自然，工作過度的勞苦平民，營養不良的營苦平民，而無法呼吸新鮮空氣的尤其是勞苦平民！特别在大都會中是如此。結果，最易發生癆病的自然就非一般勞苦平民莫屬了。最易發生癆病的旣然是一般勞苦平民，那末預防癆病，當然就該以一般勞苦平民爲唯一對象了。然而就以往的情形論，事實上並不如此。我們常聽見什麽要人上廬山養病，什麽　人上莫干山休養。而一般勞苦平民呢？不要說廬山莫干山，那猶如海上仙山，連夢也没有想過一個，就是普通的醫院，掛號是一元，普通最起碼的三等病房每月要三四十元，還要加上其他特别費，賣盡了男女還不够半年的用塲。請問一般勞苦平民呌他們怎樣防病？有了癆病又怎樣去醫？至於家庭各種衛生的設備，一切舒服的生活，這些都是非錢不行的，尤其在上海，要呼吸些新鮮空氣，也非出錢去買不可。請問這在一般勞苦平民能辦到嗎？防癆與治癆在一般勞苦平民旣屬不可能，那末防癆恊會的先生們究竟去替誰預防癆</p>
<p>病呢？</p>
<p>防癆恊會的諸位先生們不要以爲防所只須依照學理定出幾項衛生規則，呌大家去遵守，或最多設幾個義務的治療肺病醫院，再加上一些預防癆病的宣傳，呌大家注意注意，就算完事，這是預防不了什麽中國的癆病的發生的。衛生儘管多講，醫院儘管多設，儘有大部份人立在衛生之外，立在醫院之外，無法接受你們的「實惠」。有替中國最易患癆病的最大多數的一般勞苦平民從根本想法，防癆事業，才多少有點實效，否則恐未免都是空談。然而這在防癆會議中的諸位先生們又究竟有什麽法子可想呢？</p>
<p>防癆，防誰的癆？怎樣去預防？我最後要這樣懇切的問。</p>

<h3>犬與華人以後</h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>看見舐嘴匝舌的洋狗坐在洋大人身旁在汽車中，顧盼自豪的時候，我眞没有勇氣踏進那實際上，是私園的所謂公園。</p>
<p>中國人太没有公德性，好像是被誰何都承認了。列强費了幾何金錢和精力把這荒墳般的上海慘淡經營成功現在的租界，一切物質文明的享受都中國人不勞而獲，所以他們在身心勞疲之後，想藉園林之勝恢復他們費去的腦力的時候，再要被你們不知公德的中國人參與其間，他們像牛馬般的爲中國人效力，眞是太憨了｜所以顯了這條「犬與華人，不准入内」，的禁例，我們中國人似乎也應該原諒他們的苦心的。</p>
<p>然而外國人終於是和氣生財，曾無幾時，我們也能大搖大擺的出入這般實際上是私園的所謂公園。雖然化一元錢的門票，終究是天下最便宜不過的事。一年以三百六十五日計，每天僅一枚銅元弱，比較我們中國人自已經營的大世界之類，誠是不可同日而語，我們中國人在拜領之餘，將怎樣的感謝他們的盛情呢？</p>
<p>再進一步說，「犬與華人」，我猜想或者是偶然把「犬」聯合在我們「華人」頭上，但是多少還是失面子的事。如其被一個不知上海歷史的Aisiter到大中華來觀光，將誤會中國人是狗差不多的動物，此話從那裏說起。所以除去這塊「犬與華人，不准入内」的禁例，同時我們在洋冩字間工作歸來也可以大搖大擺的走這麽幾步，在國際地位上也可以將黃種的地位提高。以我個人來說，我不願安坐終日的，臥在故鄕的五進大宅子内，到上海來住一間享子間，就是這個理由。</p>
<p>如此說來，我們中國人是漸見爭氣了，可是在黃種人中也佔着一席地的東鄰眞塌盡我們的台，不見十二日柏林路透電：</p>
<p>「今日有一德人在杜塞爾道夫餐館辱駡華人爲邪徒，爲齷齪之日本人，致爲法庭判徒刑六月。該華人當時曾代被吿請求寬恕，但法庭請必懲一儆百，俾德人對於外人有相當禮貌」云。</p>
<p>在電文中雖冩明是「華人」，但觀其駡句爲齷齪之「日本人」，可見是種族上的關係被誤認了。我們中國人是不會被人這樣辱駡的。「犬與華人」的禁例已取消，哥德派拉到中國來認爲中國的女子使他「迷住了幾天」，然則中國的男子不見得是「邪徒」是「齷齪」，中國人早已爭氣了，最明顯的證據，就是能够大搖大擺的在實際上，是私園的所謂公園内散步。</p>
<p>再看下文「該華人當時曾代被告請求寬恕」，這更可證明中國人不是「邪徒」不是「齷齪」。中國人是和平民族，實大事化小事，小事化無事，德人誤認了黃種人的另一民族而辱駡，我們素以寬大爲懷，理應「請求寬恕」。</p>
<p>但是電文倒底是電文，如其「有一德人」認定了是「華人」而駡，「邪徒」駡「齷齪」，那我看見舐嘴匝舌的洋狗在洋大人身旁在汽車中顧盼自豪的時候，我眞没有勇氣踏進那實際上是私園的所謂公園。</p>

<p>據說第一次呌一個在福致里羣玉坊上帶芳名懸在電燈牌下（霓虹燈亦在此例）的姑娘到宴會席上或上等旅館中的謂之「打樣」堂差。堂差就是堂差，堂差而冠以「打樣」，就是像賣五香荳小販口中的唱詞「先吃（不可曲解）後會鈔」的意義了。</p>
<p>自然，一個麻皮搭眼的姑娘，在化錢的嫖客們心中是没有這般對象的。我時常聽見上海人說的化錢要化得窩心，我們不必再舉例，就說呌堂差。一般公子哥兒｜我姑認他們爲公子哥兒，化了錢呌一個娘兒們來玩玩，自然要窩心；不然，家中的賢妻難道不願他們玩嗎？</p>
<p>所以，堂差先得「打樣」。於是，姑娘們剃去眉毛裝假的，臉兒　黃，（一九三四式的黃烟脂）唇兒血紅，大寒天不怕生傷寒症，老是一襲薄薄的夾衫，高跟皮鞋，一身都是曲綫。（仿一身都是愛）這樣打扮起來，讓識貨的朋友「打樣」。</p>
<p>電影院開演的新片，祗要有一幕肉感的塲面，廣吿朋友就能運用生花妙筆拘魂票似的冩上肉香四溢，消魂蝕骨等許多催命符，而且化了六分半一方寸的鋅版製着一條條的來路大腿，再登上二百四十塊錢的一天廣吿。那一輩「打樣」朋友自會將孝爹娘似的雙手捧上。</p>
<p>所以，滿幅的本埠增刋，牆壁上的彩色廣吿，電影字門前的呆照，hundsad是爲窩心朋友設計的。</p>
<p>其次我想說到的是照相館，他們好像專爲女人設備，玻璃櫃前偶然被紅運高照的要偉人之類佔到一席地，我們普通的男子漢是獨付缺如的。這一點雖然也攫住了窩心的要訣，但是倒底比隔靴招癢還隔靴招癢。</p>
<p>有一個幽默的笑話：一位幽默家向方在油漆的照相館去照相，他們的職員回答：</p>
<p>「先生，請明天來。」</p>
<p>「今天男子不好照相嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，先生，明天開幕。」</p>
<p>「明天開幕？那許多女人的像片那裏來的？」幽默家指着玻璃櫃内說：「我還道今天男子不照相呢」</p>
<p>冩道這裏，我還想不出最適當的題目來，眞不知從何說起？</p>
<p>業餘信箱</p>
<h3>他爲何要對我冷淡</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>「我最愛閱業餘通信的一份子，因牠包有許多社會問題的解答，得了不少的智識，這裏先要問編者表示感謝。」我現在有個難題要請先生替我解决；讓我在下面說來罷：</p>
<p>兩年前我認得一位×君，容貌頗佳，不久復發生生戀愛，時常擁抱｜｜接吻，眞是火般的𤍠烈。</p>
<p>一二八滬戰發生，父母命我到杭州避難。我們二人，便依依不捨的分離，自此便冩信問候。及滬戰吿終，仍回原地，我們别後重逢，更是說不出的親愛；但近來不知何故，他却向我索還信件，我當時還在愛的夢中，竟還給了他，而自此以後，他便漸漸地對我冷淡，有時遇見時，竟然彼此點點頭便去了；我智識淺薄得很，簡直不懂這是爲什麽？非請先生替我說明，委實不得明白。不勝感荷之至：敬請著安　張美超上</p>
<p>編者按：關於戀愛的問題，常常有人冩信來問，我們也儘可能地在報上公開討論，因爲這是使靑年煩惱，苦悶的主要來源。張女士這封信所問的，照我們的猜測，大約是對方另有所愛，或者是他對於你有所不滿，以致漸漸地冷淡。這種事，局外人是不能隨便猜想：愛情的變動，實在是無常軌可尋，但也該非是毫無原因，不過藏在一個人的心中，爲外人所不知罷了。你旣然從前與他𤍠戀過，那就不妨老老實實的問他「是爲了什麽原故？」倒落得一個痛快。總而言之，愛情是不能勉强的决在你們中間旣然發生了裂痕，這種裂痕能修好固是最佳，萬一不能時，那希望你也不必再深究了。</p>

<h3>獄中記（十）（一）</h3>
<p>— 車輪</p>
<p>你容我申說理由，你容我申說理由！我僅僅指對我現在生的病無用，像蘇打片是很有用的藥，對我的胃確有相當的效騐！」我不敢說完全無用，</p>
<p>「但你明明講無效呀！」他似乎一口惡氣出掉了，把口氣轉換得很和平說｜｜「你要曉得本監優待你們是很寬大了，什麽地方有這樣淸潔的監房，這樣的伙食，每天有運動，醫務所也如此好的設備，每年要化費□□□元的金錢，每一個犯人要平均到□錢的一月醫費，什麽地方有這樣充足？……………你說應備有效之良藥，那一樣不是有效的，老實說虎骨木瓜酒並不是價錢大，我們如可備也可以備的，但是因怕你們吃醉了闖禍，所以不敢給你們，至於…………所謂改良監獄也算改良到盡止了，你們如好好地安分守己的去守法，那麽我們可呈報到軍政部把你們開釋或者减刑…………」</p>
<p>他的頭搖搖擺擺越說越激昂，似乎並不是對我一個人說，也確實並不是對我一個人說，他部下的科員和看守長都在着，他能使一個犯人服服帖帖的被打，並且在每一句他講完後這犯人應着是｜｜現今他看淸了他的地位和自身的聰明和能力，他現在是一個作爲表率的地位，現今他眞的像高於一切人的長官模樣。似乎他在對他部下說應該如此做，像他這樣巧妙地做去｜｜如果以後他們也遇到。</p>
<p>他克服不住他對自己的發現而高興，所以到後來他微笑起來了。對着他的部下飄去了好些得意的眼波。</p>
<p>「是，是……但是我很痛心，我的病拖延了這樣長無一些眉目，我自身十分恐怖。」我說。</p>
<p>「你眞的要酒可先要求醫官，他准了我們再批准。你打報吿也不是這樣打的啊！」</p>
<p>「是的｜｜但是我確已得了醫官的指示和允許我才請家庭買來的；拿來後我曾請求醫官來領給我，他說要我打報吿给你科長批准後才好。」｜｜我是極力抑止自己，把鋒利的話都抑止了，因爲我受過好幾次的壓迫，僅僅因爲態度隨便些。我雖這時候是一步步的伸前去，踏着正理的路，但我要顯明的拿出理由來是不行的，要他認錯是不會的；因此我用訴苦的口氣去要求他，酒我還不能就此放棄！</p>
<p>「酒，這種酒對於我是有益的，望科長能够發下！能够發下·並且這是許多人都吃過的。」</p>
<p>被壓下去的要求而再被我提出，這不是不需要勇氣的，在這種形勢下是很易被斥退的。</p>
<p>「你這樣講還有些道理｜｜你想我們那裹能够明目張膽的把這酒給你！去去，去！好好地去守法。」這是他最後的幾句話。</p>
<p>「去，回去吧！」林看守長拉了拉我的手。因爲我還立在原處不動，還想要求把酒發下。</p>
<p>「我又認識了一件事！」回號我對難友們說。</p>

<h3>電影藝人的自由觀</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>假使我們留心了影壇的動態，我們决不會忽視有些電影藝人的爲自由而奮鬭的精神。</p>
<p>首先我們應當提出便是「堂吉訶德」的作者柏蒲斯脫。</p>
<p>自從希特勒的鐵手抓住了德國的統治權之後，自從烏發公司的老板胡根堡高陞了希特勒政府的財政部長之後，固然整個的德國社會都閙成烏烟瘴氣，而德國的影壇亦跟着閙成風聲鶴唳，草木皆兵。於是不容許柏蒲斯脫再作「炭坑」類似的作品了，於是柏蒲斯脫失却了他創作的自由了。這時候他所能做到的便是「伏虎美人」的哀歌。然而希特勒魔王還不能容許他，卒將他驅逐出國。於是他在逃亡之中，在法國便作了這一部「魔俠吉訶德」。據最近的消息，他已接受了美國華納公司的契約，而將在美國製作「暴露影片」了。</p>
<p>在这裹，我們可看到他雖然被强制離開德國影壇，但是他爲了要獲得創作上自由，他終於毅然的離開德國而不屈服於强暴勢力之下。</p>
<p>此外，我們更應當提出「變歌」的主角瑪琳黛德麗。</p>
<p>瑪琳是德國人，這是衆所共知的。因爲她是世界有名的演員，於是希特勒政府便想利用她的技藝而將她當作可愛的「籠中小鳥」。起初希特勒派親信的代表，送給黛德麗許多甜言蜜語，答應給她一個使人不敢相信的高位置。然而我們的黛德麗並不爲這「殊榮」所動。其後第二次的代表又來了。除了上述的手段之外，又來强暴的威嚇。代表說：「如果這一次不去，將永遠没有回去的希望。如果不回去，國社黨將採取報復的手段，危害本人及其家屬。……」然而作爲偉大的藝人的黛德麗，並没有爲威力所屈服。</p>
<p>像這樣類似的事實，當然還有，但是我們不必再舉例了。</p>
<p>在以上的事實中，我們可以得着一種相同的基點，那便是他們爲自由而奮鬭。當然，誰也不願失却自身的自由，誰也不願永遠做强暴者的籠中的玩物，特别是每一個藝術家，當他們不能自由表現自身意志的時候，他們將和不能自由呼吸一樣苦悶。因此電影藝術家决不能做壓迫者的代言人，正和他們不願做一個能學人言的鸚鵡一樣。這是說：電影藝人應當保持他自由的意志，我們在作品上要表現什麽，我們一定要以最堅决的態度爭持到底。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「吉地」的我評</h3>
<p>— 光斗</p>
<p>为了廣吿的吸引力，抱着十二萬分的希望，踏進了「卡爾登」的大門，樓下售票處高懸着的「客滿」牌，更提高了我對這片的希望。</p>
<p>可是看後的結果呢？唉！失望得很！在這失望之下，我們爲愛護國片起見，不能不來一個不客氣的批評。</p>
<p>是的，在内地牢不可破的神權的思想，種種迷信觀念，是應該打破的。「吉地」就是遵着這個意義而產生的。可惜我們的邵導演競尙浮誇，不能够眞實的描冩，正確的指示，並且還穿揷些不相關的事在裹面。</p>
<p>我是生長在迷信最重的内地，但是我從没見過，連聽都没聽過，有肯化巨萬而求吉地的迷信者。何况片中的許鴻業，西裝革履，儼然一摩登少年。竟會迷信到這地步。也許他是洋派迷信家。</p>
<p>一向是拜金主義的老大，居然被其妻埋怨了幾句，馬上就改了他過去的行素，把舞弊得來的錢都交了出來。這轉變的奇特迅速，未免太理想化了。</p>
<p>還有冲喜這事，我只聽得有男子病娶妻冲喜，絶没有父病子納妾來冲喜的迷信。這點頗有疑問。</p>
<p>從來没有過學校的菱花村，在行小學校成立典禮的時候，一些農民，居然會唱起黨歌來，眞使我莫明其妙。（下略）</p>
<h3>評「吉地」</h3>
<p>— 之琴</p>
<p>中國的影業，眞的飛一般地進步着，「吉地」這部影片，可以更把握了前途，而爲舶來品預嗚着響亮的喪鐘，（中略）</p>
<p>这裹，讓我分述幾點：（一）很事實化的描冩一個資產階級的無理性的没落狂態，而襯出迷信的不可靠，以及農村的片面現象而指示出羣衆利益的偉大。這在意識方面是正確的。</p>
<p>（二）像全部對白的淸晰，以及演劇與擦自來火和斟酒這些動作的灌音淸晰，這是空前一切國產聲片的最大成功。</p>
<p>（三）霸王别姫一劇中之舞劍，和香姑在許鴻業納婚之前夜私逃時與阿良吿别幾幕，攝影光綫，配得良好。</p>
<p>（四）陳玉梅在「生機」與「掙扎」等片裹，已經給我們很大的印象而在這次的表現裹，更把那個印象充實偉大起來了。</p>
<p>（五）别開生面的穿揷三齣平劇，及香姑臨時推故汲水，還有如許鴻業伴墨龍陣而忽得香姑逃走消息，竟使鳳姐急着没人追的滑𥡴，都是導演獨具的聰明處</p>
<p>最後再冩一點其他的意思：</p>
<p>（一）幕中有幾次竊語，最好能講響點，使觀衆容易知道他們講的意思。</p>
<p>（二）對白有些地方不大自然，例如香姑呆看着阿良去了，她母親說：「把這一担瓜挑到屋裹去，」不如說：「瞧什麽！把瓜挑到屋裹去，」合乎當時情况。</p>
<p>（三）在講演與唱戲兩幕，灌音有點顫動。</p>
<p>（四）說明書上冩着「農村小學開學這天學生來賓，濟濟一堂。」而在畫面上却没有學生，而唱歌聲裹，也没有兒童聲音。</p>
<p>（五）跕都跕不好的鄕民，而竟能很整齊的唱着「三民！主義！……」的黨歌，未免離奇。</p>
<p>麗琳哈蕙主演「鳳求凰」係彼到美後之唯一傑作。今日在新光大戲院開映。</p>
<h3>「吉地」之我觀</h3>
<p>— 人偉</p>
<p>在「吉地」裹，我們可以找到三點不同的劇旨：第一點，是打破迷信觀念；第二點，是抨擊舊婚姻制度的不良惡習；第三點，是倡導農村水利和敎育。有了以上那麽三點，無疑義的，「吉地」的内容意識，是非常充實而可觀了。</p>
<p>導演者在這裹顯着地有着明顯的進境，隨處都可以顯出他的技巧的純熟和許多小聰明的地方。譬如三齣平劇的穿插，非常適宜；若照舊劇的格律演來，這三齣戲至少須演三四小時之久；但導演者能够擇取其中最精采的幾段：如虞姫的舞劍，正德皇的調戲李鳳姐等；雖然仍不免過於太長了些，（照我的意思，二齣已足；懷都關一齣，似可省却。）但也並不覺得十分沉悶。</p>
<p>「吉地」是一張有聲片，所以我們關係發音方面，應有相當的注意。這裹的發音，雖然没有天一當局所宣傳的那麽淸晰動聽：但在現在的國產片中，有那麽的成績，確是値得讚美的。</p>
<p>演員田方有些生澀；張振鐸馬東武表演非常認眞，但並没有驚人之處；陳玉梅和葉秋心表演得非常細膩活潑。葉秋心的表演機會並不多，差不多只有在「游龍戲鳳」一段裹，像曇花那麽地一現，但是她所給與我的印像却很好。</p>
<h3>天一碎錦</h3>
<p>— 犀</p>
<p>王元龍入天一後，主演兩部影片。一部是湯傑導演的「𤍠血靑年。」女主角是模範美人葉秋心。一部是他自己導演的「現代林冲。」女主角是以剛健婀娜見稱的范雪朋。現在「𤍠血靑年」卽將公映，「現代林冲」，也快要攝竣了。</p>
<p>「一個女明星，」攝製已有半年之久。現已剪接完竣，不日卽可送京檢查。片中描冩有聲攝影塲情形，頗爲現實。因爲天一本是專門攝製有聲片的，本地風光，自然格外逼眞。</p>
<p>高梨痕導演，胡姗，葉秋心，余光，陸劍芬，主演的「似水流年，」係根據張恨水小說改編。片中胡姗在山光水色中濯足高歌一段，擬配以美妙的歌曲。已由高天棲編就「似水流年」歌，但因是歌音調哀婉，和畫面的情緒不大調和，現在高君已决定重行改製。</p>
<p>「水果西施，」是王次龍導演兼主演，那位女主角水果西施，是陸麗霞所飾，現在公司中人，把「水果西施」做了陸麗霞的綽號，見了她，都喊她「水果西施」。</p>
<p>張恨水的小說，天一採用作爲電影題材的共有三部，除「似水流年」業已拍竣，「太平花」尙在編劇外。「歡喜寃家」劇本，已由導演裘芭香編就。主角亦已决定由陳玉梅，胡姗，余光等担任，日内卽可開始拍攝了。</p>

<h3>歌壇雙絶The　Cat　and　Fiddle(八)</h3>
<p>— 墨塵</p>
<p>道達那天下午等大家都走了，他一個人停留着。他趁這個機會，走到先莉的面前，拉着她的手說道：「我的親愛的，你知道我愛你這麽久了……亦是這麽眞心。你肯嫁給我嗎？」「肯的，」先莉的聲音好像從别一天地來的聲音，「好的，我很情願嫁給你。」很可驚的，這個消息迅速地傳佈開來了。有一天維克多正在排演那個小歌劇，他亦聽見了這個消息。他的四週就好像天塌地坼似的。他的成功，已經在眼前了，但還是遠水救不了近火，先莉，他没有一刻忘記過她，但她却忘記了他！先莉竟不能再等幾天，馬上就要嫁給道達了。他的嘴　着，牙齒咬得緊緊的。他想起了道達的狡詭，將他調開了好讓自己有接近的機會。他知道上了道達的當了，但是也許現在還不太晚………如果他的小歌劇能够早幾天成功，或者他還可以博得最後的勝利。</p>
<p>奥黛蒂興致勃勃地看了維克多。幾個月以來，她對於維克多起了一個疵心，希望他將來有一天會愛上她。她常常拿言語逗弄他，但他總是冷冷地不大理睬。她猜想着他還没有忘記先莉。但是現在先莉已經將要嫁給道達了，或者她可以設法使他回心轉意了。後來她一個人在化妝室裹，她將維克多請了來，她公開的向他宣布她的愛情了。這使維克多驚惶得手足無所措了。最後他說：「我是極端佩服你的，但我和你並没有什麽愛情。」奥黛蒂跳躍的心，有些捺不住了。她說：「你怕什麽！怕我的男人嗎？心肝，你不用怕他。無論如何，他亦不會知道的。」維克多道：「但是我並不愛你。我愛的是先莉，我永遠不會忘記她的。奥黛蒂一」</p>
<p>往心情似的，將手臂　住了維克多的脖子，柔聲地說道：「我的怪可憐的傻孩子，讓我來使你忘記她吧。我的心肝，你使我愛死了。」</p>
<p>門慢慢開了，維克多頭一個看見，進來的那個人不是别人，正是奥黛蒂的丈夫。他那傷心的樣子，着實怪可憐的。維克多連忙解釋道：「我們正在演習呢。」奥黛蒂的丈夫兩眼瞪着奥黛蒂，他說：「我始終没有答應你回到舞臺上去呀。我早就應當禁止你的。」奥黛蒂奔到她丈夫的面前，兩隻手摟住他的頸説道：「但是，我愛，你這太没有道理了。」那老頭子憤憤地道：「當然，一個老頭子和一個年輕女人相愛，多半是没有道理的。」他於是回過頭來看着維克多，那還是他們第一次見面哩。他恨恨地道：「你年紀很輕。我老了。但是我不能隨便地放棄我的妻。我惟一的方法，就是不讓她再上舞臺。」他又回過頭來向着奥黛蒂道：「請你自己决定吧。還是要登舞臺呢？還是要像我這樣的丈夫？」（未完）</p>

<h3>The 19th Route Army Will Return. Dai Ji Will Consolidate the Main Force and Concentrate It in Quanzhou, with Xinghua as the Front Line. Zhang Yan Passed Through Quanzhou and Arrived in Zhangzhou. British and American Warships Landed Troops.</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) Postal service between Zhangzhou and Xiamen resumed on the 16th, while transportation between Zhangzhou and Quanzhou was cut off. Zhang Yan arrived in Zhangzhou on the afternoon of the 16th via Quanzhou. His troops are taking the route through Quanyong to return to Zhangzhou. After the 19th Route Army retreated south, three regiments originally stationed in the Quanzhou area were transferred to Zhangzhou to assist in defense. Currently known deployments are: one regiment and two artillery battalions stationed in Zhangzhou, one battalion in Songyu, one battalion in Jimei, one battalion in Shima and Haicheng, one battalion in Qingyang between Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, one battalion in Anhai, one battalion in Dongshi, and one battalion in Shitou. All artillery shells have been transported to Zhangzhou. The Quanzhou area is the main concentration point, with Xinghua as the front line. Regarding the aftermath, Cai Tingkai is inevitably going to leave. There is no more suitable candidate than Dai Ji to handle the consolidation, because the most essential unit in the 19th Route Army was the Mao Weisou unit, known for its strict combat effectiveness and discipline, surpassing other armies. Mao's unit consisted of Dai's former subordinates. Zhang Yan's unit was second in strength, and although Zhang was close to Cai, most of his troops were also Dai's former subordinates. Neither of these two units suffered losses. With these two units as the core, Dai can effectively command the entire army. However, Dai's arrival will likely occur after the national government cancels Cai's resignation. Furthermore, Dai has not been in contact with Guangdong while in Hong Kong. The Guangdong faction sent Chen Wei Yuan to Fujian. Although Chen is an old member of the 19th Route Army, his reputation is insufficient. With Dai's arrival, the 19th Route Army will still be under the central government. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Armies in Southern Fujian Jointly Attack Zhangzhou</h3>
<p>(Shantou) Yang Fengnian, commander of the anti-rebel forces in southern Fujian, went to the Quanzhou area on the 14th to command his troops to intercept the retreating Fujian army. Zhang Shiyu led Shen Donghai, Lin Weiran, and their respective units, setting out from Zhangpu. Ye Dingguo and Chen Linrong, with their respective detachments, set out from Longyan, Hua'an, and Zhangtai, to jointly attack Zhangzhou. Contact is expected soon. It is reported that most of the troops stationed in the Zhangzhou area are former subordinates of Zhang Zhen. Cao is in contact with Zhang Shiyu to surrender and prepare to respond. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jin Zhaorong, director of the rear office of the anti-rebel militia command in Fujian, and advisor Zhang Naigong, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 16th, intending to meet with Chen Yi to report on the latest situation of the Fujian militia and express their welcome. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>British and American Warships Have Both Dispatched Troops to Land</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) The city is currently peaceful. The British cruiser HMS Berwick dispatched half a company of troops ashore this morning to provide security. Japan has increased its landing troops. The Hai Ning steamer arrived in Hong Kong yesterday. Although it carried many minor officials of the Fujian government, there was no sign of Chen Youren. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Due to the unstable situation in Fuzhou and the presence of several thousand rebel troops stationed in Nantai, the British warship HMS Berwick has dispatched forty soldiers, and the American warship USS Tulsa has dispatched twenty soldiers ashore. The number of Japanese troops landed is unknown. These guards are sufficient to protect foreigners in Fuzhou. The American missionaries on the south coast of Fuzhou were ordered by American authorities several days ago to move to safe zones to prevent the rebel army from retreating south. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>●Manila The US Naval Staff announced today that the US warship USS Tulsa has only dispatched thirty soldiers to land in Fuzhou to protect the lives and property of American citizens. They plan to withdraw after a stable local government is established. USS Tulsa sailed to Fuzhou the day before yesterday. Other ships have been ordered to proceed to Fujian. (National Telegraph on the 16th)</p>
<h3>The 19th Route Army's Retreat</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) After Cai Tingkai flew to the provincial capital from Quanzhou on the morning of the 14th, he convened a meeting of military officers in the provincial capital. Subsequently, he issued a proclamation stating that the troop deployment to cross the river was a strategic matter, and that the main battle had not yet begun. The army should still strive to maintain the safety of Fuzhou. Another report stated that Sa Zhenbing met with Cai on the afternoon of the 14th, guaranteeing the safe passage of the 19th Route Army across the river, and ordering the Chamber of Commerce to pay the outstanding loan of 200,000 yuan and hire ships for standby, requiring the entire army to withdraw from Fuzhou within three days. On the morning of the 15th, troops here were still moving along the Fu-Xia highway. Yesterday's report that Japanese sailors had gone to Mawei to board Japanese warships was inaccurate. It is heard that the Japanese consul is still requesting his country to send more warships to Fujian to protect its nationals. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Cai Tingkai was still stationed here yesterday afternoon, but today he left on horseback with forty cavalry soldiers, heading south towards Guangdong. Before his departure, he still issued a proclamation stating that he intended to defend the city to the death, but this was merely a facade to cover his retreat. Shortly afterwards, he asked Sa Zhenbing to take over the administrative affairs of Fuzhou during the transition period. Subsequently, the main force of the 19th Route Army also retreated south in order. Yesterday, the rebel troops in Nantai attempted to reach the mainland, but were deterred by the might of the central government. These troops, numbering about several thousand, are now staying in Nantai. Yesterday, a fire broke out in a certain battalion due to carelessness, spreading to a certain village where bombs were stored, causing a great uproar. After negotiations, they were allowed to continue their retreat. Two thousand government troops have advanced to the mouth of the Min River, and their main force is only ten miles from Fuzhou. The sound of gunfire can be clearly heard there. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Warships Jiang Yuan and Others Arrive in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) At dawn on the 16th, the navy dispatched warships Jiang Yuan and others to arrive in the provincial capital. Naval troops landed fully armed, and the sound of gunfire erupted. The rebel enemies fled completely. At eight o'clock, order was restored, and the entire city once again saw the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet, issued a proclamation upon entering Fuzhou, taking responsibility for the security of the city.

<h3>A Conflict Between Workers and Police at the Kailuan Coal Mines Results in a Strike. Work Was Suspended Two Days Each Week. Workers Demanded the Cancellation of the Order. Discord Led to Shooting. One Person Was Killed, and Many Were Injured. Majiagou Is Under Special Martial Law. Workers' Representatives Went to Beiping to Petition.</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) An urgent telegram from Majiagou states that since the incident, the Kailuan Mining Bureau has suffered significant losses due to the disruption of sales routes outside the pass. Therefore, it has been stipulated that work will be suspended for two days each week at the five mines in Tongshan, Linxi, Majiagou, Zhao Fen Village, and Tongzhuangzi to save costs.

<h3>Central Government Prepares to Organize National Defense Committee</h3>
<p>Strengthening national defense and safeguarding territory are the inherent duties of the government. Therefore, major powers all prioritize the study of national defense. They deeply consider and meticulously plan the management of their country's naval and land fortresses, the training of combat personnel, and the preparation of wartime economy. They also pay close attention to changes in the diplomatic situation and the rise and fall of the "hypothetical enemy's" national power, all to ensure the security of their nation. Because of this, countries have a clear understanding of the strengths of both themselves and their "hypothetical enemies," leaving no room for concealment. Both sides, fearing the other's strict precautions, dare not easily start a war, thus establishing the so-called "armed peace." Our country, having no conflict with the world, is nevertheless threatened by strong neighbors. Although we do not have an explicitly designated "hypothetical enemy," we have aggressors to fear. The perilous situation is undeniable. However, internal strife and a weak national defense have prevented us from eliminating the tragedies of losing rights and suffering national humiliation.</p>
<p>National defense is the lifeline of a nation and requires the painstaking efforts of various specialized talents over many years to achieve a firm grasp. It cannot be accomplished overnight or through the heroic deeds of a single individual. Since the opening of our country to foreign trade, we have rarely heard of major national defense plans. Every time we suffer a major defeat, we engage in a major repentance, but it is nothing more than self-pity and regret. After a brief period of remorse, we forget everything once the situation has passed. Since the loss of the Northeast, the authorities have organized a National Defense Design Committee. However, as the name suggests, the so-called "design" is merely research. Knowing only how to research but not how to implement is no different from idle theorizing. Recently, the central government has considered forming another National Defense Committee. Does this mean that they intend to move from theoretical research to practical implementation? If so, it can be considered an important policy amidst the cries of national crisis.</p>
<p>Generally, when people talk about national defense, they focus on military affairs, as if there is no national defense other than military affairs. However, we believe that military affairs, finance, and diplomacy are the three pillars of national defense, interdependent and equally important. Our country maintains an army of over two million, but when enemy troops approach, we cannot drive them away because we have too many redundant soldiers and insufficient supplies. The quality cannot overcome the quantity. Today, we should either not talk about national defense or, if we do, we must first find a way to ensure that the nation's military expenditure is commensurate with its financial strength. Once soldiers are paid properly and military funds are adequately prepared, the government's credibility will naturally rise, military discipline will be easily rectified, and the improvement of combat effectiveness will inevitably accelerate. With such a strong army, dedicated to serving the country, we can then advance to fight and retreat to defend.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the relationship between national defense and diplomacy is also easy to understand. Su Qin persuaded the six states to form an alliance, and they listened, preventing the powerful Qin from taking advantage. The Soviet Union employed its "multilateral diplomacy" and signed non-aggression treaties with Western European countries, preventing Japanese soldiers from stepping an inch into its territory. These are all benefits of diplomacy. Conversely, the Japanese seize our territory and slaughter our people, in part because our country's diplomacy is isolated and unsupported. In the future, we hope that our authorities will have foresight and establish a diplomatic strategy that greatly benefits national defense.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we believe that planning national defense is urgent and must consider military affairs, finance, and diplomacy, none of which can be neglected. As the National Defense Committee is about to be established, we dare to express our sincere hope that it will fulfill its responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Message to Congress</h3>
<p>Improve Financial Situation</p>
<p>Fully Control Currency</p>
<p>Lead to General Agreement</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt stated in his message to Congress: "In accordance with the progress we are now making to restore more appropriate prices, with the aim of ultimately achieving a less variable purchasing power of the dollar, I request Congress to re-authorize certain legislation to improve the financial and monetary situation. If we can make it clear that we are now establishing a permanent hard currency reserve for the government, we will be able to organize a sound and adequate currency control. Currency is a government prerogative. Many people advocate using gold and silver as the basis of our currency, either in a simple system or in a mixed ratio. Although the current world situation is chaotic, we hope that the situation can gradually lead to the formation of a general agreement in the future."</p>
<p>"In this time of emergency, the practice of individuals or international transfers of gold is not only unnecessary but also inappropriate. The transfer of large amounts of gold is only necessary to offset international trade balances. Therefore, it is a good policy for the ownership of gold used for currency within the country to belong to the government, and this gold should be stored in the form of gold bars rather than gold coins. The government has already issued orders to receive gold owned by private individuals or organizations. Although the Federal Reserve Bank still holds a large amount of cash, the government has the right, under current laws, to completely nationalize all monetary gold owned by the American people according to administrative law. However, because this matter is of great importance, I would rather consult with Congress and use special legislation to transfer all gold supplies owned by the American people to the government, with a clause attached to pay for the cash received with gold certificates. Gold certificates are always guaranteed by the Treasury's gold and paid in dollars according to the amount, and the weight and composition of these dollars can be specified at any time. This legislation can give the government ownership of domestic gold reserves and allow it to reduce the gold content of the dollar for the sake of public welfare, and the benefits derived therefrom also belong to the government. If there is a need to increase the gold content of the dollar for the sake of public welfare, the losses will also be borne by the government."</p>
<p>"Once the ownership of gold is entirely transferred to the government, all gold reserves can be a permanent fixed hard currency reserve, and its increase or decrease will only be carried out when clearing international balances or when the international agreement allocates world gold reserves in the future. Once this permanent policy is established, the time will come to more accurately determine the gold value of the dollar."</p>
<p>"Because the world situation is uncertain, I believe that it is not yet possible to determine the exact value for the sake of public interest. Under the current legislation, I have the right to decide that 50 percent is the permissible minimum. After careful research, I feel that redetermining the exchange rate to exceed 60 percent of the current value is not in the public interest. Therefore, I ask Congress to stipulate that redetermining the exchange rate at 60 percent is the permissible maximum. In order to prepare for greater stability in our foreign exchange rates, the Secretary of the Treasury, in addition to having the right to buy and sell gold at home and abroad, should also have the right to deal with foreign exchange, allocating 200 million yuan from the profits after the devaluation of the dollar for the purpose of buying and selling gold foreign exchange and government currency certificates, and regulating currency, maintaining credit, and other uses."</p>
<p>President Roosevelt hinted that current laws related to the handling of gold and other monetary matters will be amended, saying that silver has a long history as a currency standard, and it is in itself a currency. Almost half of the world's people use silver as currency, which is one of the most important parts of our own monetary structure. Silver is an element in world international commerce and should not be ignored. A notice was issued on December 21 to plan to mint silver coins, increase silver reserves, and make the United States the first country to fulfill the silver agreement. The silver agreement is a step in the right direction, and we are now fulfilling it.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt went on to mention the promises made at the World Economic Conference, saying that if the governments of the countries concerned fulfill these promises one by one, the use and value of silver will greatly increase. The US government can also use silver as a currency standard. I hope to increase the use of silver, but I do not want to make any recommendations to Congress at this time to expand the use of silver in currency, because I believe that we can use other monetary methods to learn more about the results of the London agreement.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt emphasized two principles: First, the national currency must maintain its soundness, have lasting purchasing power, and be sufficient for daily needs and the establishment of credit. Second, the government has the right to issue currency and is the sole protector and owner of the currency standard. Therefore, the government should have the right to decide the scope and nature of hard currency reserves at any time. President Roosevelt concluded by saying that he believed that the people would be able to understand the government's intention to maintain credit and establish a sound exchange medium for the needs of the people.

<h3>Roosevelt's Explanation</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt explained his message to Congress to reporters, saying that the most urgent goal of his monetary plan is to restore the purchasing power of the dollar to the level that prevailed when the average debt in the United States was incurred, so that debts can be repaid with dollars of the same value as when the debts were incurred. This procedure is not intended to overissue paper money. The government wants to obtain the power to allocate equalization funds for the purpose of buying government bonds, only to protect the prices of government bonds and prevent private holders of government bonds from selling them cheaply. (15th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Issues Three Orders</h3>
<p>Control Bank Private Exchange</p>
<p>Prevent Capital Outflow</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, President Roosevelt issued three orders based on his message to Congress: (1) Expanding the scope of the order of March 10 of last year, all private individuals and registered banks can engage in foreign exchange; (2) All those engaged in foreign exchange must register with the government; (3) The US Mint can receive raw gold with government permission, but the raw gold purchased must be priced according to the Treasury's regulations, with a handling fee of 35 percent. Therefore, the regulation stipulates that gold is worth 34 yuan and 43 cents per ounce. According to general observations, the second order is a step to prevent capital outflow. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Wall Street is Enlivened</h3>
<p>New York Designated as Free Market for Raw Gold Purchase</p>
<p>(New York) Since the publication of President Roosevelt's message, the atmosphere on Wall Street has been enlivened, with active trading in stocks and commodities, and government bonds are also viewed favorably. There is a rumor here that the President will designate New York as a free market for the purchase of raw gold, which can maintain international finance and investment. As for the current impact of the President's message, it has prompted a continued decline in the exchange rates of silver and gold dollars. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Monetary Policy Stabilizes Currency Prices, Concrete Steps, Extremely Positive Response in Congress</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt submitted the currency bill to both houses of Congress today. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau claimed that from January 16, the official price of newly mined net gold would be 34 yuan and 45 cents per ounce, minus a handling fee of 25 per thousand.</p>
<h3>Important Provisions of New Currency</h3>
<p>The important provisions of the currency bill are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Ownership of the Federal Reserve's gold reserves is transferred to the Treasury Department, and the Treasury Department gives the Reserve Bank gold certificates of equal value in US dollars.</p>
<p>(2) Cash must not be circulated. Gold coins are abolished. Apart from the gold certificates held by the Federal Reserve Bank, no currency may be exchanged for gold in the amount that the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary to maintain the equal purchasing power of various currencies.</p>
<p>(3) The Secretary of the Treasury, with the approval of the President, has the right to buy gold at home and abroad, without limit.</p>
<p>(4) The Secretary of the Treasury may pay the interest on public bonds in advance and sell gold at home and abroad. In order to stabilize exchange rates, the Secretary of the Treasury may buy, sell, or discount bills of exchange, checks, and exchange notes, and receive debt instruments.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Movement to Stabilize Currency Prices</h3>
<p>The above are the main points of the currency bill. President Roosevelt said that he does not approve of paper money policies, but issuing limited, non-interest-bearing five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes, as stipulated in the Thomas Amendment, cannot be said to be overissuing paper money. He is confident that he can stabilize the price of the dollar within a limit of 56 percent. He believes that the movement to stabilize currency prices in the United States can promote the pricing of currencies in other countries. It is estimated that the government can obtain profits from the reduction in the gold content of the dollar, amounting to between 340 million yuan and 420 million yuan.</p>
<h3>From Tonight Onward, All Gold Will Be Nationalized</h3>
<p>Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has set the deadline for private individuals to hand over all their gold to the Treasury Department as Wednesday night. As for the gold reserves of the Federal Reserve Bank, they are not included, estimated to be over 350 million yuan. The Financial Rehabilitation Corporation has increased its total amount to 150 million yuan, and all but 25 million yuan has been used. Domestic purchases totaled 681,000 ounces, worth 22,898,000 yuan. Foreign purchases were worth 97 million yuan. Jones, the director of the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation, claimed that the re-pricing of the dollar could enable the Rehabilitation Corporation to profit from gold, as the Rehabilitation Corporation could sell gold abroad. The Financial Rehabilitation Corporation's foreign gold is designated for withdrawal in London and Paris.</p>
<h3>Three Executive Orders Control Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt issued three executive orders announcing government control of foreign exchange transactions, with banks and private individuals subject to licensing policies. The White House claimed that the orders were virtually the same as the regulations issued on March 10, except that private individuals engaged in foreign exchange are also subject to the regulations, not just banks. It is said that the effect of the new orders is to allow Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to exert his influence. (15th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Extremely Positive Response in Congress</h3>
<p>(Washington) The impact of President Roosevelt's message on the New York market today was that the price of newly mined gold jumped from 34 yuan and 6 cents per ounce to 34 yuan and 43 cents. This number is in line with the decision to limit the gold content of the dollar to 60 percent. The initial response to President Roosevelt's message in Congress was extremely positive. Democrats unanimously supported President Roosevelt, and Senate Republicans also convened a meeting of their party to consider their policies. (15th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Await Final International Agreement, Dollar and Pound Both Depreciated, Franc Stable, No Problem, Japan Will Further Depress Currency Prices</h3>
<p>(London) President Roosevelt's message to Congress arrived in London after business hours, so there was no reaction in London today. However, the public feels that the re-pricing of the dollar at 60 percent, although it affects Britain and France, is still tolerable, awaiting a final international agreement. The public expects President Roosevelt to now be willing to establish an international agreement. The United States retains the possibility of further devaluing the dollar by 11 percent. The public sees this as a tool for the United States to use for consultations with other countries. If the dollar is devalued by more than 14 percent, it will force France to abandon the gold standard, and the current advantage of the United States, which President Roosevelt wants to maintain as long as possible, will be lost. President Roosevelt's message arrived in Paris after the market closed, but both the dollar and the gold pound have depreciated today. Paris is now in a state of uncertainty and panic, but the stability of the franc seems to be no problem. (15th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) London did not respond with unsympathetic acceptance to the announcement of the US gold policy. The detailed explanation of this policy has reduced market anxiety. Londoners feel that this is a concrete step towards international currency stability. The biggest reaction in the stock market today was the market's attention to gold mining stocks. The stock prices of gold mines in South Africa, Western Australia, and Western Africa have all risen. US securities are also firm, but British first-class securities and railway stocks have been sold, intending to obtain funds for future speculation. Textile stocks are looser than before, the reason being the anxiety that competition between US and Japanese textiles will intensify, as it is expected that Japan may further depress its currency value. In the foreign exchange market, the pound sterling is weaker than other gold currencies. The reason seems to be the large-scale purchase of gold and gold coins by the Americans in London and other places. Although President Roosevelt's message does not contain anything that would allow Americans to sell their silver, silver prices are now showing signs of loosening. The market price of British goods is in sympathy with the US market and is also higher than before. (16th Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Discusses Trade Impact</h3>
<p>Or Will Increase Tariffs</p>
<p>To Prevent US Goods from Being Dumped</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet will discuss the impact of the dollar devaluation on British trade at its regular meeting today and will seek to prevent US goods from being dumped in the British Empire. It is reported that if the British Cabinet sees a continuous influx of US goods, it will increase the current tax rates or levy new taxes on goods that were previously tax-free. All decided measures will invite the cooperation of various autonomous regions to achieve practical results. According to financial circles here, President Roosevelt's message to Congress yesterday will at least put the gold standard in a temporary predicament. According to a source close to the Bank of England, the US dollar, after being reduced in content in accordance with President Roosevelt's message, will make US goods more competitive in foreign trade. This move will force the countries that are still clinging to the gold standard to compete to depress their currency values. President Roosevelt's message caused great surprise in London. The opening exchange rate of the pound against the US dollar was 5.15, which then fell to 5.15 1/2. According to financial circles here, the US dollar, after being devalued by 6 shillings, will allow the pound to reach 5.45, or even continue to fall. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>French Finance Minister Concerned about the Franc</h3>
<p>May Affect the Pound</p>
<p>Believes It Does No Harm to the Franc</p>
<p>(Paris) After President Roosevelt's message on currency was sent to Congress, Finance Minister Bonnet held an important meeting with his staff and Mr. Jillot, a member of the Bank of France, to discuss the impact of the US monetary policy. Those responsible believe that the US President's message may affect the pound, but not only is the franc completely unharmed, but its value is also becoming more and more solid, and even foreign capitalists will regard it as a more stable currency and be happy to purchase it.

<h3>Japanese Government Worries About the Future</h3>
<p>Advocates Changing Gold Production Policy</p>
<p>Decline of Japanese Exchange Rate Affects Our Country</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government, concerned about the future of the Japanese-American exchange rate due to the United States' implementation of devaluation, intends to establish a strategy for stabilizing the exchange rate. The Ministry of Finance also attaches great importance to this issue and is determined to study its methods. Within the Ministry of Finance, opinions advocating for changing the domestic gold production policy and re-establishing the fundamental principles of the gold policy, as well as adopting a system of purchasing domestic gold and averaging exchange rate funds, are gradually gaining strength. That is, the current foreign exchange management system only aims to suppress exchange rate speculation and does not have the function of actively stabilizing exchange rates. Therefore, it is necessary to implement new measures to prevent future rises in Japanese gold prices and stabilize fluctuations in exchange rates. However, Finance Minister Takahashi has always opposed artificial exchange rate stabilization policies. Therefore, which method will ultimately be adopted is attracting much attention from all parties. (16th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(China United Press, local dispatch) According to a certain banker, the Japanese exchange rate has continued to fall for days. Today, one hundred yen is only worth eighty-six yuan in national currency. Therefore, it is more advantageous to transport Japanese goods to China. Japan's exchange rate dumping policy poses a great blow to the future of our country's promotion of domestic goods. At today's exchange rate, one yuan of Japanese goods only sells for eighty-six cents in our country, which is still very cost-effective. If our government does not take early measures to deal with this, the future of domestic goods will be unimaginable. Japanese merchants expect the Japanese exchange rate to fall to around seventy yuan.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Secretary Indicates Continued Intent to Borrow Money</h3>
<p>If US-UK-France Agreement is Reached</p>
<p>International Currency Prices Will be Stabilized</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that the government still intends to borrow $1 billion, but the profits from the devaluation of the dollar can be used to cover government expenses. The Treasury Department intends to receive all of the gold owned by the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation at the old price of $20.67 per ounce, with the losses borne by the members of the Rehabilitation Corporation. Morgenthau also stated that he believes that the agreement between the United States, Britain, and France is sufficient to promote the stabilization of international currency prices. American gold reserves can be allocated to other countries in the form of commercial credit. If France abandons the gold standard, it will hinder American monetary policy because it will change the price of gold. The government has now issued an executive order prohibiting the export of all American legal tender, such as silver coins, unless licensed. Foreign exchange transactions and credit transfers required for ordinary commerce may continue as before without a license. Senator Thomas told people that this is a more extensive inflationary action than any inflationary advocate has hoped for. American currency and silver can all be nationalized in the same way as gold. Some silver auxiliary coins will continue to circulate, but a large amount of silver will be stored in the national treasury as preparation for issuing banknotes. The New York Sun reported that most bankers and economists believe that a fourteen-cent devaluation of the dollar is still too small. (16th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Tragic Plane Crash on the Way Back From Saigon, Ten Passengers Killed, Governor-General of Vietnam Also Among the Victims, Frozen Parts and Malfunctioning Operation Were the Cause of the Crash</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French long-distance flight team, led by General Veilman, successfully flew in Africa and returned to France. It arrived at Le Bourget airfield near Paris in the afternoon. People in the French capital were elated and prepared to celebrate enthusiastically. Unexpectedly, the bad news of the "Jade" arrived in the evening, shocking everyone. The plane was flying back to France from Saigon when it crashed near Corbigny. All ten passengers, including Governor-General of Vietnam Pasquier, were tragically killed, and people were deeply saddened. The ceremony planned to welcome the Veilman flight team was cancelled altogether. The details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>The "Jade" plane, carrying Governor-General of Vietnam Pasquier, Commerce Director Xu Mi of the Aviation Department and his wife, took off from Athens at 7:00 AM today, arrived in Marseille at 2:23 PM, and departed again at 3:10 PM. It then arrived in Lyon at 4:20 PM, and at 6:15 PM, it flew towards Paris again. At 7:10 PM, the "Jade" sent a radio message reporting wind and snow along the way. At 8:45 PM, the Corbigny police reported that the plane had crashed and caught fire. Residents of the Corbigny area rushed to the rescue, but the fire was fierce and unavoidable, and there was no way to save them. Pasquier, Xu Mi and his wife, pilot Lu Nai, radio operator Kan Bai'er, mechanic Gailan, director of the airline's technical team Basailuke, director of the business team Nogai, technician Ci Lio, and Pasquier's adjutant Pu Lusu, a total of ten people, were all burned to charcoal. Aviation Minister Gu Tuo, upon hearing the news, immediately went to the scene of the accident by car with Deputy Minister Tellesar for inspection. It is believed that the "Jade" was flying in wind and snow, and the weather was very cold, causing some parts to freeze and malfunction, resulting in the accident. According to reports, the "Jade" had previously set a flight record last year. It departed from Saigon a few days ago to fly back to France, and was forced to land near Pos Tao due to damaged parts. Governor-General Pasquier then switched to another plane to fly to Damascus in Syria. After the "Jade" was repaired, he took it back to his country, but unexpectedly suffered a tragic accident. (15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Details of the Accident</h3>
<p>◎ Corbigny City: The French commercial flying large monoplane "Jade," carrying Governor-General of Vietnam Pasquier and Commerce Director Xu Mi of the Aviation Department, etc., was flying back to Paris from Saigon when it crashed in Corbigny City, 200 kilometers from Paris, last night. Further details are as follows:</p>
<h3>A Loud Crash and the Plane Caught Fire</h3>
<p>Last night, the "Jade" plane flew over Corbigny at a very low altitude. At 7:40 PM, a loud crash was suddenly heard. Within seconds, the entire plane caught fire and broke into thousands of hundreds of red-hot pieces, scattered everywhere. The skeleton of the fuselage was thrown fifty meters away from the crash site, showing the intensity of the explosion. The fuselage was burning fiercely and impossible to approach. Although attempts were made to rescue the passengers who were burned to ashes, it was too late. The military police rushed to the scene and only managed to retrieve some pieces of paper and personal belongings from the plane. The military police then tried to maintain order to prevent crowds of curious onlookers from touching the charred bodies of the passengers and the wreckage of the plane. As for the details of the accident, they will not be known until a few days later, or may even remain a mystery forever.</p>
<h3>Lightning Flashed, Snow Fell, and the Wind Helped the Fire</h3>
<p>However, it is generally said that the weather was unusually bad yesterday, with strong winds, lightning in the sky, and rain and snow alternating. According to the mayor of Corbigny and others who witnessed the accident, one wing of the "Jade" caught fire and separated from the fuselage, still flying a long distance before falling to the ground. Others said that the plane's radio antenna drooped below the fuselage and connected to the current in front of the plane, causing an electrical fire.</p>
<h3>The Cause of the Accident Still Needs Investigation</h3>
<p>Others who heard the explosion said that the plane crashed due to the explosion of the oxygen cylinder used to start the engine. However, the exact cause will only be determined after an official investigation. It is reported that the "Jade" had previously been piloted by the aviator Tao Lei for various tests, and had also undergone 150 hours of continuous flight. (16th, Havas)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Discusses Saar Problem as Focus, Germany Declares Refusal to Send Representatives to Meeting of Technical Cooperation Group for China</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Although the League of Nations Administrative Council has formally notified Germany that it will prepare for the 1935 plebiscite in the Saar region this week, German Chancellor Hitler has stated today that Germany does not want to send representatives to Geneva. According to sources close to the government, Germany has no reason to change its bystander attitude towards the League of Nations. Germany has already advocated for the immediate return of the Saar region last year. If it sends representatives to Geneva to listen to plans for the Saar region plebiscite, wouldn't that be self-contradictory? The German government's attitude is that the League of Nations can solve the Saar problem without Germany's assistance, which can demonstrate its fairness. (16th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The most politically relevant matter at today's meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council was the speech by French representative Massigli. He repeatedly requested that Germany be able to participate when the Saar region plebiscite issue is discussed in the League of Nations. It is generally believed here that France's move shows a bright attitude and expresses goodwill towards Germany. Even though Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, there is no harm in treating France with the same goodwill. Moreover, regarding the withdrawal from the League of Nations, it will only be possible to actually leave after a two-year period from the notification of withdrawal. Germany notified its withdrawal last October. Now, when discussing the Saar issue, which is most relevant to that country, how can Germany not send representatives to participate? This matter can also be exemplified by Japan. Japan has also notified its withdrawal, but Japan still sends representatives to participate in various shareholder meetings or committees of the League of Nations that are related to its interests. In addition, France's expression is intended to protect the interests of all countries on the one hand, and to make it easier for all countries to exchange opinions on the other hand. If Germany ignores this, then it cannot later accuse the Administrative Council of disregarding Germany and its interests. French Foreign Minister Pongu can arrive on Wednesday. Before Pongu arrives, Massigli will first meet with British representative Eden and Italian representative Aroasia. What they will discuss will likely be the ongoing disarmament negotiations and the various issues listed on the Administrative Council's agenda. (15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Germans Not Tempted by France, Public Opinion Unanimously Advocates Rejecting Invitation</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German public opinion generally indicates that Germany will resolutely reject the League of Nations' official invitation to participate in the League of Nations Council meeting regarding the preparations for the Saar region's plebiscite on self-determination. This invitation has now been conveyed to the German government by French representative Massigli at the League of Nations Council. German public opinion claims that the only intention of this invitation is to tempt Germany to return to Geneva, which is impossible. Even if Germany is willing to return to Geneva, it will not remedy the facts of the Saar issue. Only the Kreuzzeitung slightly stated that when the issue of organizing a plebiscite committee is raised for discussion in the future, Germany may study whether or not to actively cooperate.

<h3>"German Front" Submits Document to League of Nations</h3>
<p>Representing German Political Groups in the Saar Region</p>
<p>Denying That the National Socialist Party Has Engaged in Transgressions</p>
<p>◎ Saarbrücken: Today, the organization called "German Front," representing various bourgeois political groups in the Saar region, submitted a document to the League of Nations Council in response to the report submitted by the Saar Governing Commission to the League of Nations Secretariat. This document is a supplement to the previous document submitted by the German Front, because the report submitted by the Saar Governing Commission to the League of Nations Secretariat has clearly aroused opposition from the people of the Saar region. The document believes that the Committee's report is a forced interpretation of the facts and shows undisguised partiality towards France's views. The document also states that the various horrors of the National Socialist Party mentioned in the report are untrue, and that members of the National Socialist Party in the Saar region abide by strict laws. Even if individual party members engage in irregular actions, the Committee strictly prohibits various gatherings of the National Socialist Party, while the independent and separatist factions organized by the French are allowed to freely propagate and develop. The document further states that all disturbances in the Saar region are caused by the Socialist Party or the Communist Party, while members of the National Socialist Party are often arrested and tried for wearing uniforms that are prohibited. The final section of the document states that the French-made imagination, that a large part of the Saar region will support the maintenance of the status quo or merger with France in the 1935 plebiscite, is a dream that the Saar Governing Commission will also realize cannot become a reality, because the people of the Saar region are completely German in language and blood and long to merge with their motherland.

<h3>Committee on Cooperation with China Meets</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Committee on Technical Cooperation with China met this morning, chaired by Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Administrative Council. Those present included Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to France. The Committee will also convene again during this session of the Administrative Council. (16th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council's Committee on Technical Cooperation with China met this morning and approved the report by Dr. Rajchman (Polish representative). The report expressed satisfaction with the situation in several important centers in China as a result of the League of Nations cooperation resolution. It also stated that new construction work plans are still under study, and that road construction, water conservancy, rural reconstruction, education, and health work are now actively underway. The report also said that after the specific plan has been effectively approved by the National Government, a more detailed report will be submitted. (16th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Rumor That Soviet Russia Will Join the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Paris) Although people are generally very satisfied with the news that Soviet Russia will join the League of Nations, they ultimately feel that it is too early to say. Only the League of Nations General Assembly has the power to decide on the admission of new members, and the General Assembly will not be able to meet until September. According to this situation, it can be seen that the Soviet Russian government may not necessarily have any clear expression at present, and the rumor still needs to be questioned. (15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>British and Italian Envoys Arrive in Vienna for Political Contacts</h3>
<p>⊙ Vienna: The sudden arrival of Granville, the Parliamentary Secretary to the British Foreign Secretary Simon, has surprised people here. Although the mission of Granville's visit is officially stated to be of a purely private nature, on his first day here, he visited Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss and Vienna Mayor Seitz and other political figures for lengthy talks. Furthermore, Italian Foreign Minister Suvich will also arrive here on Thursday, reportedly to discuss a certain commercial issue related to Italy's granting Austria certain concessions regarding the rights to the Port of Trieste. However, after this report was issued, Hungarian Minister of Agriculture Kalay also announced that the period of their visit will be slightly extended so that he can have on-the-spot contacts while Austria and Italy are negotiating. The original mission of Kalay's visit was to contact the Austrian government on a certain important economic issue. Fifteenth National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Chairman of Disarmament Conference Goes to Geneva</h3>
<p>(London) Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, set off for Geneva this morning, intending to make an extreme effort at one of the most urgent sessions of the conference in the two years since its opening to make it a success. Henderson claimed before leaving that he felt that no government was willing to see the Disarmament Conference end without any tangible results. Therefore, the economic, political, moral, and financial events involved are of paramount importance. (16th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Former Cuban Agriculture Minister Hevia Elected as Successor President</h3>
<p>Sworn in the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Capital Once in Turmoil</p>
<p>San Martín Abandons Politics and Returns to Teaching</p>
<p>⊙ Havana: After President San Martín abdicated, Agriculture Minister Hevia was elected as the successor president. According to the Associated Press, Hevia initially refused to take office because the military and the public expressed their support for San Martín, but according to the latest news, Hevia has actually decided to take office. (15th, Havas)</p>
<p>⊙ Havana: Conflict broke out yesterday when former Cuban President Martín was forced to resign and new President Hevia was sworn in today. Four people were killed and fourteen injured in the exchange of fire. Just as new President Hevia raised his hand to take the oath, students supporting the former president suddenly opened fire with guns, and the troops immediately returned fire. Bullets flew everywhere, and people dodged the bullets, causing great chaos. Troops stationed at the Colombia camp rushed to restore order, and the president continued the inauguration ceremony.</p>
<p>New President Hevia is only thirty-five years old and is the youngest president in the world. In 1920, he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. When former President San Martín was in office, he was the Minister of Agriculture, and people generally regarded him as a loyal supporter of President San Martín. Unexpectedly, he was the mainstay of the opposition party. After the new president took office, he immediately announced that he would convene a meeting to discuss the constitution. After President San Martín was forced to abdicate, he declared that he would no longer participate in politics and would resume his old profession, teaching at the Faculty of Medicine of Havana University.

<h3>The Japanese Are Actively Designing to Control the Military and Government of the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Abolish Provinces and Establish Circuits, Making Them Similar to the Japanese and Korean Systems</p>
<p>Special Puppet Guard Units Distributed to Various Regions</p>
<p>Northeast Japanese Army Has Reached 150,000 Men</p>
<p>High Alert Around March 1st</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to people from Changchun, the puppet state is currently planning to form new special police units to be deployed in: 1. Wafangdian, Andong, Yanhe, Manzhouli, Yuguan, Gubeikou, Xifengkou; 2. Yingkou, Suifenhe; 3. Guerrilla police units will be deployed in Changchun, Harbin, etc. The Japanese fear that the puppet state's provinces are too large and difficult to control, so they intend to use the puppet state government's request as an excuse to adopt the same system as Japan and Korea, abolishing the provincial governor system and establishing several circuit systems. Each circuit will have a circuit intendant who will administer several counties under the puppet state's Ministry of Political Affairs. This plan is being secretly discussed and is expected to be implemented gradually this year. The Japanese army in the Northeast has now reached more than 150,000 men. In addition to a division and a brigade deployed along the Heihe River and the Great Wall, the rest are secretly transported to northern Manchuria. Recently, two divisions were deployed from the mainland to Korea, plus approximately 100,000 puppet state troops and the newly established independent garrison units. The total military force controlling the entire Manchuria is 300,000 men. It is reported that the Japanese Air Force stationed in Manchuria has 200 aircraft, all of which are the latest models, capable of traveling more than 300 miles per hour. (16th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet state plans to divide the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang into thirty military districts, with a garrison unit established in each district.

<p>(Changchun) Zheng Xiaoxu plans to issue a declaration internally and externally on the issue of Puyi's usurpation of the title of emperor in the latter half of this month. The general idea is that since Puyi came to power in the eastern provinces, the people's lives have improved significantly and have received special assistance from Japan. The puppet state has achieved today's development because Puyi changed the national system to an imperial system at the request of 30 million people, which is in accordance with the will of heaven. He also specifically stated that Puyi's claiming the title of emperor is not dictatorship. (16th, China United Press)</p>

<h3>After Arriving in Nanjing, Zhang Qun Temporarily Recuperates in Tangshan - A Few Words on the Hubei Situation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After arriving in Nanjing on the 15th, Hubei Governor Zhang Qun caught a cold and had a sore throat. He immediately took a car to the Tangshan Club for recuperation. Because he needed to report on the situation in Hubei to President Wang, he returned to the city on the morning of the 16th. According to reports, his departure from Hubei was sudden, so he did not have any proposals prepared. He only drafted a plan for reorganizing local politics on the boat, selecting those that needed to be implemented urgently, inspecting them, and submitting them to the Fourth Plenary Session for discussion. Hubei's annual unified tax revenue is about 6 million yuan, and the likin revenue is about 15 million yuan, totaling about 20 million yuan. The government expenses were originally sufficient to cover it. Since the abolition of likin, the revenue has decreased sharply. Although the Central Government provides a monthly assistance of 500,000 yuan, it is still insufficient. Currently, due to the Central Government's financial constraints, the 500,000 yuan has been reduced to 300,000 yuan, and currently, only 200,000 yuan is being provided. Although the business tax has begun to be collected, it is not thriving, yielding only about 6 million yuan per year. Revenue and expenditure still cannot be offset, especially as the education funds cannot be independent, and difficulties constantly arise. Now, Director Chen Qibao has drafted a plan and submitted it to the Executive Yuan, which will be sent to the two ministries of education and finance for consultation and implementation after proper arrangements. The method is to imitate the education funding methods of Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces, with the</p>
<h3>Proposed Fundraising Measures for Post-Flood Yellow River Project</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Kong Xiangrong, Chief Inspector of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, arrived in Jinan from Kaifeng and stated that if there is no solution for the post-flood prevention project for the Yellow River, it could seize the Wei River and flow into the sea in the north, or seize the Huai River and flow into the Yangtze River in the south. Minister Kong is determined to block the breach and also plans an overall Yellow River management plan like Yu (the Great). The project is divided into three parts: 1. Blocking the breach; 2. Post-flood prevention; 3. Temporary flood prevention. The 1.5 million yuan for blocking the breach has already been secured. The temporary flood prevention funds are the existing funds of the river bureaus of various provinces. However, the post-flood project requires more than 10 million yuan. The proposed fundraising methods are: 1. Implementing additional donations on ship and train passenger tickets and postal and telecommunications; 2. Requesting relevant provinces to designate guarantees for issuing public bonds; 3. Requesting allocation of American cotton and wheat loans. The above methods have been telegraphed by the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to various provincial governments and water conservancy agencies to solicit their consent. He has met with Liu Zhi, who agreed. The Anhui provincial government and the North China Water Conservancy Commission also agreed. The remainder of my journey to Jinan is to pay respects to Han and solicit his agreement. Once all parties agree, a telegram will be sent to the central government for approval and implementation.

<h3>Lord Marley and Others Aid the Noulens</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Noulens ended their 25-day hunger strike and were transferred to the Central Hospital for treatment, Lord Marley, leader of the British anti-government party, and others in London planned to ask those sympathetic to the Noulens to sign a petition to the Chinese government to bail out the Noulens. Judicial authorities said that the Noulens' crime of endangering the Republic of China has been confirmed, so how can they be released with just a piece of paper? They should know that China is an independent country, and the judiciary is solemn. Last time, the Anti-Imperialist League telegraphed the Ministry to apply for bail, but it was not approved. However, the Ministry has no authority to inquire whether the Anti-Imperialist League has this overriding power internationally. In short, the Noulens committed crimes in China and should be subject to Chinese law, not subject to interference from anyone. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Situation of the Recovery of Xiamen｜Du Qiyun Has Sent Personnel to Mobilize in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou</h3>
<p>(Xiamen Correspondence) After the establishment of the pseudo-government in Fujian Province, the people of Fujian Province and overseas Chinese have appealed to the central government to eliminate the rebels as soon as possible. In order to quickly resolve the matter, the central government commissioned Du Qiyun, the former commander of the 17th Army, as a special military envoy in Fujian, to preside over the coordinated suppression at the same time as the dispatch of troops to attack and suppress. After receiving the order, Du, along with Sun Xiangfu, Wu Zhaohua, Xie De, Yang Tianyu, Wan Sheng, etc., arrived in Gulangyu on the 2nd and immediately deployed everything to prepare for resolving the rebel troops stationed in Xiamen and recovering Xiamen Island. It was originally planned to launch on the 5th, but because the navy stationed in Xiamen was concerned that the local people would inevitably suffer losses in the bloodshed after the military launch, Lin Guogeng, commander of the Xiamen Fortress, discussed a peaceful solution with Du. Du also expressed sympathy for this, saying that the purpose of this military action was to disarm the rebel troops and recover Xiamen. He has always been concerned about the welfare of the local area. It would be best to avoid disturbing the local area. Therefore, the original plan was changed, and the navy persuaded Huang Qiang to give up voluntarily, but it was delayed for several days without results. On the 9th, the rebel troops stationed in Xiamen received a telegram from Cai Tingkai ordering them to resist to the end. Du knew that the rebel side was capricious and decided to eliminate them by force. At 12:00 that night, he ordered all the plainclothes teams to be dispatched. The deployment was as follows: (1) 100 plainclothes team members divided to destroy the rebel troops' transportation, cut off their military telephone lines, and occupy the telephone and telegraph offices and the enemy's transportation agencies. (1) 120 Mauser teams, carrying hand grenades, surrounded the rebel company headquarters in Houyuan Township. (1) Two platoons of patrol teams and 60 Mauser teams, carrying bombs, surrounded the rebel camp headquarters in Houyuan Township. (1) One platoon of patrol teams and 30 Mauser teams, carrying bombs, surrounded the rebel troops in Puyuan. (Two platoons) Two platoons of patrol teams and 40 Mauser teams surrounded the rebel troops in Hulian Township. (1) A total of 100 patrol teams and Mauser teams surrounded the rebel company headquarters in Gaoqi Township. (1) One platoon of patrol teams and 30 Mauser teams attacked the rebel troops in Wutong, and plainclothes teams were ambushed on the main roads to block fleeing rebels. (1) More than 300 patrol teams and plainclothes teams were scattered around the areas near Meiren Palace, Douzaiwei, and Zhongshan Park to block the reinforcements in the city. In addition, five companies of patrol teams were concentrated on the heights of Andou Township as a reserve team. On the naval side, the Yongjian and Jiangzhen ships were dispatched at the same time and berthed on the sea off Gaoqi. The Chuqian ship berthed on the sea off Houyu, and the Yixian and Zhongshan ships berthed inside the ports of Wutong and Xiamen City to prevent the rebel troops from crossing the sea to escape and to block the rebel reinforcements from Zhangzhou and Tong'an. After the deployment was completed, at 1:00 AM on the 10th, an order was issued to launch all the routes simultaneously. Initially, the rebel army used delaying tactics to perfunctorily advise the navy. They did not expect the punitive expeditionary army to take such a swift and sudden action. They were caught off guard. Sun Xiangfu, Zhang Lianzhi, Lin Shaoqiu, Jian Jifeng, Xie Liang, etc., personally went to Huang's camp to announce everything. Everyone bowed their heads in submission and obeyed the reorganization. A total of three infantry companies, one company of military police (complete with firearms), one machine gun company (six machine guns and three automatic rifles), and one special service team were reorganized by Xie Jingbo, commander of the 1st Provisional Brigade of the punitive expeditionary army under the jurisdiction of Du. On the morning of the 10th, the Fujian Military Special Envoy Office of the Military Commission was established in Xiamen. All the agencies occupied by the rebel party were recovered at the same time. It was originally planned that 600 plainclothes team members, each carrying short guns and bombs, would surround and confiscate the puppet municipal government guards and the public security bureau security team. Later, because the rebel party fled, their teams and firearms were easily resolved. The city was as peaceful as usual. The citizens were extremely happy with Du's speed in resolving the military situation in Xiamen. On the 11th, the Special Envoy Office ordered the Second Regiment of the punitive Xie Jingbo Brigade to go to recover Kinmen. There were not many rebel troops in the area, and it was resolved within two hours. In recent days, the special operations team of the Political Department of the Special Envoy Office and the militia from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou have been mobilized to various places. In addition to Zhangping, Hua'an, and Kinmen being recovered, the rebel troops stationed in various places are currently under siege and attack. Zhangzhou City, the rear of the rebel army, is in a state of panic. On the 11th, all private cars were requisitioned, and the troops were moved without a fixed location, seemingly trying to struggle and make a final battle. (January 12</p>

After the bandits ransacked the place, they went to Yongqing's room to ransack, losing about 100 yuan. Also, on the evening of the 13th, the home of Gu Yinxiang, a villager in Xiaojing Jian Township outside the south gate, was also forcibly ransacked by many bandits. However, the villagers did not have much savings, so the losses were still small.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Bureau's Shanghai-Qingdao Route "Puan" Steamer Robbed by Pirates Outside Wusong Estuary, Fifteen Pirates Force Change of Course to Shanghai-Guangdong Route, Pirates Disembark at Zhao'an, Kidnapping Nine Passengers, Losses Approximately Five or Six Thousand Gold, Expected to Return to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's "Puan" steamer, which departed from Shanghai to Qingdao on the 13th of this month, was robbed by fifteen pirates who boarded the ship in Shanghai disguised as passengers. The robbery occurred eighteen nautical miles north of Sheweishan Island outside the Wusong Estuary. The pirates forced the ship to sail towards the Shantou sea area. A large amount of silver, money, and goods were robbed. Before leaving, they kidnapped nine passengers. The Shanghai Bureau has telegraphed the Ministry of the Navy to dispatch warships to pursue and rescue the passengers, and ordered "Puan" to return to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Heading to Qingdao</h3>
<p>The "Puan" steamer was originally a transport warship of the Ministry of the Navy. Last year, it was leased to the China Merchants Bureau. It was initially used for the Putuo-Qingdao route. Due to its large size and spacious passenger cabins, and after major repairs by the China Merchants Bureau, it was well-received by passengers. After the lease expired last year, it was renewed for three months and converted to a dedicated Shanghai-Qingdao route, focusing on passenger transport. On the 13th of this month, it departed from Shanghai to Qingdao with more than fifty first, second, and third-class passengers and over 11,000 pieces of cargo. The journey from Shanghai to Qingdao usually takes 28 hours and it was scheduled to arrive in Qingdao at 2:00 PM on the 14th. However, it did not arrive on time. The director of the Qingdao branch was in Shanghai on official business and instructed an employee to send a telegram to the Shanghai headquarters to inquire. The Shanghai headquarters received the report and initially suspected that there was fog on the sea and that "Puan" might be anchored en route. It ordered the wireless station operator Fang Ziwei to send a telegram with the call sign XNPA, but there was no response. They were very anxious. Yesterday, they received a telegram from Qingdao stating that crew members of the Yisheng steamer of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which was heading to Qingdao, reported seeing "Puan" off course and heading south, causing even greater concern. It was not until 9:00 PM last night that they received a telegram from the ship owner of "Puan" reporting the robbery.</p>
<h3>Pirates Mix In</h3>
<p>When "Puan" departed from Shanghai, it was docked at the Hua Zhan pier in Pudong. The ship was scheduled to depart at 9:30 AM on Saturday, but on the 13th, it was delayed until 10:15 AM. At that time, first and second-class passengers had already boarded the ship. Just as the ship was about to set sail, more than ten third-class passengers rushed to board and also boarded "Puan" to Qingdao. The crew members were busy with departure preparations and did not pay attention to these passengers. According to Sheng Wunian, the comprador of another steamer, who was unharmed, he was disembarking from "Puan" when it was untied and saw this group of passengers boarding the ship just before departure. Their actions seemed suspicious, but the ship had already started moving and it was inconvenient to inspect them again. The ship's personnel did not suspect that pirates had mixed in. By the time "Puan" cleared customs, the matter had passed. It was only when the news of the robbery reached Shanghai that it was realized that the pirates had planned carefully, fearing that they would be discovered if they boarded the ship too early. Therefore, they waited until departure to board, taking advantage of the timing to sneak onto the ship.</p>
<h3>Control the Whole Ship</h3>
<p>The fifteen pirates, all speaking Cantonese, had weapons hidden on their bodies and were scattered throughout the third-class cabins. Since the ship had no iron railings or anti-theft measures, all levels of cabins, the bridge, and the pilot's platform were freely accessible. According to the ship owner's subsequent telegram, "Puan" had left the Wusong Estuary and traveled eighteen nautical miles north of Sheweishan Island, and was sailing north. The pirates then emerged from the third-class cabins, each holding a pistol. They fired shots as a signal and rushed to the ship owner's room, first forcing the ship owner, Rex, and the first and second officers to be under surveillance. They also occupied the wireless room, took the telegraph operator Zhu Shun into custody, and prohibited communication. At this time, there was no naval escort on the ship. The ship owner and others were forced to hand over their self-defense pistols. The crew members lost the ability to resist and had to adopt a policy of non-resistance. The entire ship was under the control of the pirates, who forced the ship owner to order a change of direction and head towards the Shantou sea area. This occurred after 4:00 PM on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Robbery Situation</h3>
<p>After taking control of the entire ship, the pirates began to rob. They first searched the main dining room and the second-class cabins, then proceeded to rob the third-class cabins. All cash, silver dollars, banknotes, and women's jewelry carried by the passengers were robbed. Finally, the better clothes and items carried by the passengers were also robbed. After several rounds of looting, everything owned by the passengers and crew was completely looted. The stolen goods were piled up in the cabins, and then the passengers' suitcases were taken to pack the loot. It is said that the silver dollars from ship tickets sold by the purser Zou Lun were also robbed. The total loss of cash, clothing, and other items is estimated at five or six thousand gold, but the exact amount will not be known until the ship arrives today.</p>
<h3>Damage to Goods</h3>
<p>The "Puan" ship was carrying 8,000 bags of flour, 113 bags of white rice, 15 pieces of foreign cloth, 2,187 pieces of paper, 124 boxes of cigarettes, 166 boxes of books, 211 barrels of oranges, and other items such as seafood, burlap sacks, and ironware, totaling more than 11,000 pieces. However, there were no valuable goods. The pirates forced the crew to open the cargo hold and take out a box of cigarettes, which they opened and smoked freely, distributing them to the passengers. They also opened a piece of foreign cloth and took out several bolts to use for hoisting stolen goods for escape at sea. The remaining goods were not touched, so the loss of goods was minimal.</p>
<h3>Nine Passengers Kidnapped</h3>
<p>After looting, the pirates expressed disappointment at the meager gains. They then kidnapped passengers from the cabins. Among the passengers on the "Puan," there were sixteen first and second-class passengers, including four women and four children, and more than forty third-class passengers. The pirates kidnapped nine male passengers from the first and second-class cabins but did not disturb the women and children. The names of the kidnapped passengers (the China Merchants Bureau has a list that can be checked, so they are omitted). Sun Zhenwu, the director of the Qingdao branch of the China Merchants Bureau, happened to be returning to Qingdao on "Puan." Upon hearing the news of the robbery, he disguised himself as a sailor and managed to escape being kidnapped. The purser Zou Lun and the crew were not kidnapped.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boat Transports Loot</h3>
<p>Around 7:00 PM on the 15th, the "Puan" steamer had sailed to the Zhao'an sea area at the intersection of Fujian and Guangdong provinces. After completing the robbery, several pirates searched along the coast and found two fishing boats. They forced "Puan" to stop and transferred the stolen goods and the nine kidnapped passengers to the fishing boats in the Zhao'an sea area and left. After the pirates left the ship, the ship owner and others began to organize everything, determine the navigation route, and sail to Shantou for temporary mooring. They telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters to report the robbery.</p>
<h3>Telegrams to Apprehend Pirates</h3>
<p>The first telegram from "Puan" reporting the robbery arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 PM on the 15th. Since no one was in the office, it was sent to Liu Hongsheng. At 11:30 PM, they received a second telegram from the ship owner. Liu Hongsheng, together with the Shipping Department, began planning to apprehend the pirates and rescue the kidnapped passengers. At midnight, they sent a telegram to the Ministry of the Navy, stating: "According to the ship owner of 'Puan', on the first day of the month, the ship arrived eighteen nautical miles north of Sheweishan Island, and pirates disguised as passengers robbed the passengers, who were all looted. Before leaving, the pirates kidnapped nine passengers. Please quickly telegraph the fleet stationed in Fujian to pursue and rescue the kidnapped passengers. Liu Hongsheng of the state-run China Merchants Bureau." After sending this telegram, they also sent telegrams to the branches in Shantou, Xiamen, and Fujian, instructing them to request local army and police assistance in the pursuit to prevent the pirates from escaping far.</p>
<h3>Ship Already Sailing Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Liu Hongsheng sent a wireless telegram to the ship owner of "Puan", ordering the ship to return to Shanghai from Shantou immediately. Yesterday afternoon, they received a telegram from "Puan" stating that it had already set sail and was en route, estimated to be heading north at 25 degrees 37 minutes north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude. However, due to severe weather, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon or tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Inquiries from All Parties</h3>
<p>After this incident occurred yesterday, many family members of passengers who had boarded the ship went to the China Merchants Bureau to inquire about the situation. The General Affairs Department of the Bureau provided answers and comforted them, stating that they had requested the Navy authorities to rescue them. Yesterday, Liu Hongsheng also submitted a report to the Ministry on the "Puan" robbery based on the ship owner's report. The ship's losses were minor, and the crew members were not injured.</p>
<h3>Belgian Envoy Arrives in Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>To Host Banquet for Nanjing Authorities Today</p>
<p>The Belgian Minister to China, Baron Guillaume, and his wife took the night express train to Nanjing last night. They are scheduled to host a banquet for President Wang today (17th), inviting Secretary-General Chu, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Railways, and other ministers, vice-ministers, and directors to attend. It is reported that the Belgian Minister has been in Shanghai for a long time and will stay in Nanjing briefly before returning to Beijing.</p>
<h3>British Aviation Commissioner Mr. Willock Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Says China Needs a Large Quantity of British Aircraft</p>
<p>According to the *Continental Daily News*, Captain Willock, the aviation commissioner of the British Embassy in China, who was dispatched by the British government in September last year at the request of the then British Ambassador to China, Sir Miles Lampson, arrived in Shanghai on the mail ship *Rampurla* on Sunday. He is currently staying at the Cathay Hotel and will go to Beijing within a few days and then to Shanghai to set up an office. This is Mr. Willock's first visit to China. He told a reporter from the *Continental Daily News* that he had just unpacked his luggage and could not yet discuss or express his plans or opinions on China's aviation industry. However, he dared to say that China needs an unlimited number of various types of British aircraft, so he will pay close attention to the great progress of China's military and civilian aviation industry in the future. It is reported that Captain Willock served in the Light Infantry during the European War and transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915, where he repeatedly achieved meritorious service. After the end of the European War, he worked in the Air Ministry and was involved with the British Air Defense Committee.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Communication Test Completed, Opening Ceremony Decided for Early Next Month</h3>
<p>The Public Will be Invited to Visit at That Time</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Zhenru Sino-British Wireless Radio Station of the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has been conducting communication tests since the 12th. In order to understand the current status of the Sino-British communication test and the opening date of the station, a reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Director Lu of the Bureau yesterday. According to him,</p>
<h3>Excellent Test Results</h3>
<p>The wireless transmitter for Sino-British communication is a high-power shortwave spark gap wireless transmitter, which was ordered from the British Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. It is the latest type of equipment. The tests have been excellent since 3:00 PM on the 12th. The tests are still in progress because the test work requires testing each item one by one, and the work is very complex. It is expected to be completed by the end of this week.</p>
<h3>The Public Will be Invited Soon</h3>
<p>Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, has decided to hold an opening ceremony in Zhenru after the completion of the test work. At that time, Zhu Jiaji, Minister of Communications, will attend the grand ceremony. The opening date is scheduled for early next month. If the test work is very smooth, it is planned to open on the 3rd of next month. If there is not enough time, it will be postponed to the 10th of next month. It has also been decided to invite the press and all sectors of society the day before the opening to report on the preparation process. In order to make everything clear to all sectors of society, Mr. Wen has already compiled a report booklet, which details the functions of the station, the construction costs, and equipment diagrams, so that it can be distributed to guests at that time.</p>
<h3>Sino-US Test Report Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Director Lu believes that the report in yesterday's newspapers that the station will hold a Sino-US test report after the completion of the Sino-British test report is inaccurate. He also said that China and the United States have already formally communicated and there is no need for a test report. Moreover, the equipment for Sino-British communication is spark gap shortwave, which can only be used for communication between China and the United Kingdom and cannot be used for communication with the United States. As for the prices after Sino-British communication, they are the same as the prices set by foreign companies.</p>
<h3>Consuls of Chile and Russia Visited Director Yu Ming of the Foreign Affairs Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Consul-General of Chile and Acting Chargé d'Affaires to China, Mr. Smart, visited Director Yu Ming of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at around 11:00 AM yesterday. They had discussions and left after about twenty minutes. Later, at around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Mr. Yu received the Russian Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Spielvanik, at the office and had a meeting. It is reported that they were all official contacts, different from paying a courtesy visit, so Mr. Yu did not need to return the visit.</p>

<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>Shanghai is our country's premier commercial port, a vital hub for land and water transportation, and a center where merchants gather, and talent and wealth mostly congregate. The city's population has already reached over three million, accounting for more than five percent of the entire populations of countries like Italy and Japan. It leads in trends, its culture is rapidly advancing, and its industry and commerce are increasingly prosperous. It has subtly taken the lead in guiding the interior. We, the citizens of Shanghai, can certainly boast of this, but we should also know how to motivate ourselves. If we can rely on the innate intelligence of the great Chinese nation, strive with unity, and diligently manage our affairs, then not only will we prosper our city, but we will also advance all our fellow countrymen to a realm of wealth and strength. This should not be too difficult. However, in recent years, the market has shown signs of decline, all industries show signs of decay, foreign goods are increasingly flooding in, and unemployment is increasing daily, to the point where everyone is just trying to get by. This has turned into a makeshift situation. Alas, society has declined to such an extent! What is the reason for this? Although there are various reasons, the biggest key is the gift of the January 28th Incident. At that time, the Japanese army did everything possible to bombard the Zhabei area with artillery fire for more than fifty consecutive days. All commercial and civilian storage areas were reduced to ashes, and areas with connected Chinese houses were turned into ruins. Even the distant Nanshi and Pudong were left with neither homes nor markets. Although there were foreigners living in the concessions, their situation was different, and the impact was still alarming. Electric wires were tangled in the middle of the roads, airplanes came to drop bombs from time to time, rumors spread, and there were several scares in one night. Merchants hoarded goods at high prices, and refugees surged like tides. Factories and shops were forced to close, and even more staff and workers lost their jobs. Some were separated from their wives and children, and some committed suicide by jumping into the river. All kinds of tragedies emerged endlessly. The visible and expressible losses were countless, and the hidden and unacknowledged losses were definitely hundreds or thousands of times greater. This means absorbing intangible losses and being indirectly burdened by intangible losses. The entire city suffered such a huge and unique wound, and the unlimited losses made the situation at the time unbearable. The aftermath was even more difficult to arrange. In addition, current life and production are even more difficult. If vitality is not restored one day, society will not be stable one day. Although the war is two years past, the city's situation has not improved. This is a matter of trying to make ends meet, and the facts make it so. I believe that there are many ways to revive this city, but to replenish the foundation and cultivate the root, we must choose the most urgent, closest, and most common matter of reducing housing rents. This definitely needs to be resolved immediately. This is because the problem of housing for people is more important than clothing and food. Clothing and food are certainly related to being cold and hungry, but there are still ways to settle them. Housing is related to life and death, and it is a real need. Not only can it shelter from wind, frost, rain, and snow, and accommodate food, lodging, and storage, but also family life, birth, old age, sickness, death, marriage, sacrifices, and even the interactions of relatives and friends, and the arrangement of work all require housing. Therefore, the housing problem has also become important. Shanghai's rents are the highest in the country. The social environment has never been as pressing as it is today. If tenants can maintain their livelihood, who would want to cause trouble? Who would have known that at this time when vitality has not recovered and the city's situation is declining, there are a few capitalists and real estate operators who disregard the people's livelihood and only know their own interests, repeatedly raising rents to make up for their losses in old age. Houses that cost only ten or more yuan a month a few years ago now cost dozens of yuan. It is difficult to satisfy their greed by raising rents, so houses can be renovated. This has become a common practice, and society does not pay attention to it and allows it to happen naturally. As a result, all tenants find it difficult to afford it, resentment arises, and public opinion boils. Most of the blood and sweat of a family or shop is transferred to the landlord. Other necessary expenses, no matter how urgent, are only allowed to be delayed. Sometimes, if payment is delayed, in addition to the unreasonable actions of the real estate agency, lawyer letters and court summonses come one after another, and there is almost no peace. If they leave the house in anger, it is impossible to do so. If they listen to the exploitation, it is difficult to cope with. They cannot live in peace or enjoy their work. The reality is like this, and the future is bleak. It is not just the end of one family or one shop, but the same end for all families and shops in the city. Because they cannot survive, those who come from the poor areas of the interior to obtain the qualifications of Shanghai tenants are even more at an end. However, when the January 28th Incident ended, some areas of the city close to the war zone were exempted from rent for three or four months or one or two months. However, this can only be regarded as a temporary emergency measure, and absolutely cannot be regarded as enough to make amends. The Principle of People's Livelihood advocated by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen is intended to ensure the necessities of our people's lives. Today's Shanghai landlords are acting against the tide, ignoring the people's suffering. Are they not too heartless? However, there are differences among them. Some are ignorant of the general trend, some have their power taken by flatterers, and some dare not reduce rents alone. We should not regard them as all the same. In recent days, there are often empty houses in the busy city, and there are frequent disputes over rent collection. Even rent advertisements often have new rules for reducing rent by a certain amount and giving one month's rent. This further proves the unreliability of one party's exploitation and the exhaustion of the other party's ability. Alas, the city's situation is declining year by year, and we are still worried about not having a way to remedy it. How can we impose more shackles? We live here, how can we sit idly by and watch society collapse and decline without providing assistance? The matter is urgent, and the situation is pressing. Our association is duty-bound and cannot refuse to participate in this rent reduction movement for the sake of solving the people's difficulties in Suzhou, for the sake of ensuring social tranquility, for the sake of restoring vitality, and for the sake of revitalizing the market. Most of the landlords are Chinese, and money can communicate with the gods, and society should be maintained. Once the tide has turned, how can we survive? If the market recovers, there will be no future worries. Rather than expecting the impossible, why not make small profits for a long time? Even foreigners advocate co-existence and co-prosperity, how can Chinese abandon themselves? If they can suddenly realize this and immediately and voluntarily reduce their rents, then not only will the tenants be grateful, but the entire society will also benefit greatly. This matter is of great importance and depends on the collective wisdom and efforts of everyone. Our countrymen and leaders will definitely sympathize with us. Therefore, we make this declaration, hoping that you will consider it carefully.</p>
<h3>Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance's Document to President Wang Regarding the Kim Seok Case: In Fact, There is No Dispute Over Kim's Nationality, and Even According to Japanese Law, There is No Need to Explicitly Allow it</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Lou Yunmei, the representative lawyer for Kim Seok, submitted a document to President Wang, which read: "To President Wang, with utmost respect, regarding the case of Kim Seok's illegal arrest by the Japanese Consul, the detailed facts and negotiation process have been submitted in a special document, and I believe that you have reviewed them. However, I recently received a letter from Mr. Zhi, stating that you said, 'The difficulty lies in that Kim Seok himself admits that he has obtained Chinese nationality, while the Japanese side does not recognize Kim Seok's renunciation of Japanese nationality as valid. The future nationality of the two countries is the most contentious issue between China and Japan regarding Koreans.' His judgment is correct, and his observation is insightful, and it is difficult to find anyone who could surpass it. However, based on the facts of this case, there should be no dispute over Kim Seok's nationality. Furthermore, according to legal principles, regardless of whether Kim Seok has renounced Japanese nationality or not, and residing within Chinese territory, there is no doubt that Kim Seok should be subject to Chinese law. In order to clarify the truth and facilitate negotiations, the facts and laws are presented in detail as follows:"</p>
<h3>Facts</h3>
<p>"Kim Seok has been setting up residence in Shanghai, China for six consecutive years since October of the 18th year of the Republic of China, when he naturalized in China with his father. This alone is sufficient to prove the fact that he is a Chinese citizen. Furthermore, Kim Seok and his father were arrested in the same way last November. At that time, our government, based on Kim Seok's certificate of nationality, seriously negotiated with the Japanese side, which finally agreed to release him. If the Japanese side did not recognize Kim Seok's renunciation of his nationality and his naturalization in China, why did it not raise the dispute over nationality at that time and refuse to release him? It was not until now that it re-issued this fallacy. I really do not understand its intentions. Therefore, based on the facts, Kim Seok's nationality issue has been determined once, and it cannot be allowed to be disputed again, undermining our sovereignty."</p>
<h3>Legal Aspects</h3>
<p>"Based on the above facts, regardless of whether the Japanese side has tacitly approved Kim Seok's naturalization in China, according to Article 20, Paragraph 1 of the Japanese Nationality Law, 'A person who acquires a foreign nationality voluntarily loses Japanese nationality.' There is no need for explicit approval from the Japanese government, and there are no special provisions for Koreans to renounce their nationality. Japan adopts a purely laissez-faire policy towards its citizens renouncing their nationality. From the perspective of Chinese law, there is only Chinese nationality. According to the general principles of international law, this is a natural conclusion. Even if we take a step back, even if Kim Seok has not lost his Japanese nationality because he has not been approved by the Japanese government, Kim Seok has already legally obtained Chinese nationality. At most, he can only be considered to have obtained dual nationality. According to the Nationality Law Convention signed by various countries in The Hague in 1934, Article 5 stipulates that 'Within the territory of a third country, a person with more than one nationality shall be deemed to have only one nationality. Without prejudice to the application of the law of that country to matters of personal status and to the validity of treaties, that country shall, of all the nationalities of that person, choose the nationality of the country where his habitual or principal residence is situated, or, in other circumstances, the nationality of the country which appears to be most closely connected with him, and recognize it as his sole nationality.' Now that Kim Seok has naturalized in China and his family has lived in Shanghai for six years, the country with which he has the closest relationship should naturally be recognized as China. Even if Kim Seok lived in France, it should be handled in this way, let alone living in China. According to the interpretation of the above-mentioned legal text, this is a natural conclusion. Moreover, the fact that Kim Seok is a Chinese citizen has been proven by facts and the tacit approval of the Japanese side. Therefore, according to the region where he resides, the Second Special District of Shanghai, it should naturally be handled in accordance with the agreement on the establishment of Chinese courts in the French Concession of Shanghai. However, they are actually breaking the agreement heartlessly. Therefore, China's regret to the French Consulate is no less than that to the Japanese Consulate. Based on the above explanations, there is no doubt that Kim Seok should be a Chinese citizen, according to the facts and the law. I respectfully request you to review and approve it, and promptly lodge a serious protest and negotiation with the French and Japanese consulates to release him, so as to protect our sovereignty. I respectfully submit this, and wish you peace and tranquility. Lawyer Lou Yunmei"</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Northern Rice Industry Porters Petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>Demanding an Immediate Solution and Waiting Until Late Without Dispersing</p>
<p>The Joint Rice Industry Conference Unanimously and Firmly Refused</p>
<p>"The Shanghai Northern Rice Industry porter labor dispute, since the new and old workers had a dispute the day before yesterday, the porters petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, and the rice industry held a meeting to discuss countermeasures, deciding to refuse porter labor, otherwise they would rather stop work altogether to deal with it. The details are as follows:"</p>
<h3>Porters' Petition</h3>
<p>"Shi Dengfu, the foreman of the Hongtai Yuji Porter Company, and all the workers, because they had a business license, had repeatedly fought for work. After a dispute with the dock workers the day before yesterday, yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Shi Dengfu, Wang Dafu, Yang Zhenrun, and others led more than 120 workers, wearing red vests, from Wuzhen Road Bridge to the city center to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding that the third item of the previous commercial solution be implemented, ordering all factories to settle them. They arrived at about 1 p.m., and were received by Wang Gang, a staff member of the Third Section. He said that regarding the issue of settling unemployed workers, the bureau had ordered the submission of a list of names, but the lists submitted repeatedly were inconsistent and varied greatly, making them unreliable. Now that the workers had come to the bureau to petition, he immediately registered them. As a result, only more than 80 of the 120 workers were on the previous list, and the rest could not be checked. Wang then advised the visitors, saying that after the bureau verified that the workers were indeed former porters, it would order all factories to settle them. Most of the workers were satisfied and gradually dispersed. However, a small number of workers, about 40, demanded an immediate solution and waited without leaving. After Wang repeatedly persuaded them, they became unreasonable, and he had no choice but to send the police to the scene to suppress them. As of 8 p.m., the workers were still lingering and had not dispersed."</p>
<h3>Joint Rice Industry Conference</h3>
<p>"The various rice industry groups in the city, because Shi Dengfu repeatedly led crowds to cause trouble, greatly affecting business, held a joint meeting at Cuixiu Hall yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock. Representatives from the bean and rice industry guild, the rice milling industry guild, the Shanghai Southern and Shanghai Northern offices of the bean and rice industry, the Shanghai Southern and Shanghai Northern rice transport merchant association, and various firms, including Zhu Zixiang, Jiang Zisheng, Zhang Songtao, and others, totaling more than 70 people, attended. Zhu Zixiang chaired the meeting. First, the chairman and Jiang Zisheng reported the events of the disturbance the day before yesterday. After discussion, they all said that the foremen of each firm had guarantees and bore heavy responsibilities. They unanimously refused the Hongtai porters. If they still wanted to gather crowds to cause trouble, they would rather stop work throughout the city to deal with it. At the same time, they also petitioned the party and government to stop them. The meeting adjourned at 6 o'clock."</p>
<h3>Two Representatives from Queensland Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Came to Promote Commerce</p>

They plan to inspect everything in Java, the Straits Settlements, Manila, Hong Kong, China, and Japan. They arrived in Shanghai on the mail ship "Rampurra" on Sunday and plan to stay for ten days or two weeks to contact the British Chamber of Commerce and others. It is said that Queensland is rich in natural resources, especially timber and coal."</p>
<h3>After the Founding Meeting of the China National Products Sales Company</h3>
<p>Solemn Congratulations from Mayor Shi of Beijing</p>
<p>Encouraging People to Work Hard in Production</p>
<p>Helping the Government Build National Strength</p>
<p>"The China National Products Sales Joint Company held its founding meeting on the 15th of this month at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The details of the meeting were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The details of what we have obtained are continued as follows:"</p>
<h3>British Love of National Products</h3>
<p>"Mayor Shi of Nanjing City once studied in Britain, Belgium, France, and other countries, and stayed in Britain the longest. Therefore, he has a deep understanding of British politics and human affairs. This time, he represented the Beijing Municipal Government to attend the Shanghai meeting, wanting to express the spirit of cooperation between the government and the people, and wanting to introduce the human construction of British politics. On the same day, after being introduced by Chairman Wang Xiaolai, he stood up and gave a speech amidst applause from the entire audience. He said, 'I (referring to himself as the Mayor) came to Shanghai this time to celebrate the completion of the founding meeting of the China National Products Sales Joint Company. The organization of the China National Products Sales Joint Company is different from ordinary companies. The declaration calls it a bulwark of economic self-defense, which is its value. When the company was founded, I accepted the invitation of Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Wu Zhihao, and others, even though I knew that my ability was shallow. However, in view of the internal and external troubles, the disasters caused by nature and man, and the panic of social economy and rural bankruptcy, I really could not but do my best to follow suit. Today's China is like a dangerous boat drifting in stormy waves. The government and the people must work together in the same boat to save it. The plan adopted by the China National Products Sales Joint Company is far-reaching. I met with the author of the plan, Mr. Ren Jinpin, in Beijing. Mr. Ren called the company an organization against the East India Company and the South Manchuria Railway Company. If all the shareholders of the company and all the officials and people who care about it can support it, it will indeed be a great undertaking to save the country. The British political spirit is worthy of reference. During the European War, I happened to be in Britain, and the Anglo-Japanese alliance had not yet expired. However, British students secretly boycotted the Japanese goods sold in Britain. I was surprised and asked them, 'Our England is a country that implements commercial policies. If the people cannot compete to buy and love the country's goods, then the industrialists and merchants will be in starvation.' Looking at British history, we can see that it has fought more than 70 times for the right to sea transport and trade. From this, we can see the power of the British to exercise policy and build the psychology, and we can also see the source of British hegemony. The China National Products Sales Joint Company is an agency for the people to assist the government in implementing production policies. Therefore, I hope that after the company is established, it can do its best to assist both production and sales in accordance with the declaration and plan, jointly cooperate, and jointly seek production, so as to build the national strength as the foundation for the government to defend itself and resist foreign aggression.'</p>
<h3>List of Elected Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>"The election of directors and supervisors began at 6 p.m. the night before and the results were announced at about 9 p.m. A total of 21 directors were elected, including Kong Yongzhi, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jingren, Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Chen Guangfu, Lang Zhihao, Zhou Zuomin, Shi Ying, Yu Qiaqing, Wu Tingsheng, Yu Zuoting, Zhou Guanhong, Hu Wenhu, Xue Chunsheng, Wang Boyuan, Xu Caicheng, Wang Yintai, Zhang Rongchu, and Xiang Weichen. Five supervisors were elected, including Xu Xinliu, Chen Gongbo, Fu Pinggui, Xiang Shengwu, and Zhang Shiqi. The shareholders present were all happy, believing that the reputation, knowledge, and ability of the elected directors and supervisors were sufficient to bear the heavy responsibility of the company and could fulfill the expectations of the shareholders and all sectors of society to implement the plan."</p>
<h3>Mayor Shi Has Returned to Beijing</h3>
<p>"After the founding meeting was completed, Mayor Shi returned to his residence in East Asia, packed his luggage, and was escorted by Ren Jinpin and Wu Guangzhi to the North Station at about 11 p.m., where he took the 12 o'clock train back to Beijing. The Mayor's trip to Shanghai was only to attend the founding meeting and had no other tasks."</p>
<h3>Important Bills Passed</h3>
<p>"In addition to amending the articles of association, the founding meeting also discussed and determined the capital, reporting that the total amount of shares was 260,500 yuan, which exceeded the stipulated amount of half of the required capital by 10,500 yuan. It was then resolved that the capital would first be registered with the Ministry of Industry at a total amount of 250,000 yuan, and then the board of directors would determine the method to continue to raise 250,000 yuan. The remaining 10,500 yuan would be discussed by the shareholders with larger investments to be set aside or recovered."</p>

<p>"</p>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>The Women's National Products Movement Propaganda Conference of the First Special District Citizens' Association of this city issued a declaration stating that under the government's policy of preventing economic aggression by foreign powers in recent years, and in the autumn of the people's continuous promotion of the national products movement, the number of excess imports in foreign trade has increased since 1927. In the previous year, it even reached a huge sum of 900 million yuan. Last year was the National Products Year, and the number of excess imports should have decreased significantly. However, the fact is not so. The countryside is declining, and domestic goods are falling in price, while large quantities of cotton and wheat are purchased, resulting in an excess import of 800 million yuan. Fortunately, the purchasing power of the inland people has declined; otherwise, it would definitely exceed the number of 1932. Alas, how lamentable! Some Chinese people have a mentality that this is all the government's business, and the people are not involved. After several studies, we feel that this mentality is indeed wrong. If the people do not strive for self-improvement, it is difficult to blame the government, which is generated by the accumulation of the people, for being omnipotent. We believe that purchasing and using national products is a basic national obligation. However, some people, especially those in commercial ports with a foreign atmosphere, believe that national products are not as cheap and good as foreign goods, and they have various excuses and calculations, refusing to buy or use national products unless they are foreign goods. Then, the rulers will naturally be more concerned and serious about the country's affairs in many aspects. Moreover, individuals purchase and use national products as needed, and will not necessarily go bankrupt, while a slight impatience with the country's affairs will lead to immediate destruction. This is truly the epitome of being harsh on others and lenient on oneself. Last year was designated as "National Products Year," but it did not have a significant effect on the development of national products. This year, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Association, and various women's organizations have jointly designated this year as the "Women's National Products Year." Women's patriotism is purer than that of men. A certain lawyer once showed no sympathy for patriotic people and even attacked them severely, but his wife forced him to change his ways. From this, it can be seen that the effectiveness of women purchasing and using national products will definitely surpass that of men. Since last year's National Products Year, our association has been constantly calling out after being initiated by various leading groups. We dare not make an exception for this year's Women's National Products Year. Therefore, at 1:00 p.m. on January 17th, we will hold a propaganda conference at the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, hoping to save the country by saving ourselves, starting from the family, and starting from women. The beginning of saving the country is to purchase and use national products, for women to purchase and use national products, and for women who control the family to purchase and use national products.</p>
<h3>The Wuding Road Police Station Cracks Down on Red Pill Manufacturing</h3>
<p>Confiscates Poisonous Substances and Detains Four People</p>
<p>Mastermind Jiang Peisheng Has Escaped</p>
<p>Sun Aizhong, the chief inspector of the General Police Station, received a report from an informant the day before yesterday, stating that someone was privately setting up a red pill manufacturing facility at No. 10 Wuding Village, Wuding Road, producing a large number of pills every day and distributing them to various brothels. He reported this to Inspector Lu Liankui and Western Inspector Bai Pu, and specially requested the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant. Yesterday afternoon, at around 4:00 p.m., he assisted Chinese Inspectors Feng Zhiming and Song Bingzheng in secretly conducting a search. When they arrived at the room upstairs, they saw that red pills were being manufactured. They confiscated six and a half pounds of red pills, another four bags totaling two pounds, as well as a complete set of red pill manufacturing equipment, two pounds of rock sugar, two cans of pigment powder, scales, suitcases, and other items. They detained four people, including Pan Huizhong, Huai Axing, Zhou Huiwen, and Shi A'er, all from Suzhou, and took them to the Gordon Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station brought all the seized items to the court. The police station's lawyer, Jiang Baolian, presented the case, stating that after detaining the four defendants, they confessed that they had sold red pills to the Chang'an Lane No. 267 brothel on the French Concession's vegetable market road, and that the mastermind, Jiang Peisheng, lived at No. 24 Hekang Lane, Nine Acres. The police station then joined forces with French Concession detectives to investigate, but Jiang had already fled upon hearing the news and was not arrested. Only a woman, Zhang Zhou, her son Zhang A'yue, and the second landlord, Chen A'ming, were detained in Chang'an Lane and taken to the French Concession Police Station. They were sent to the Second Special District Court for questioning yesterday morning. The police station still needs to investigate the four defendants and requested permission to postpone the trial. Judge Wu Tingqi briefly questioned the four defendants and ordered them to be detained for another seven days.</p>
<h3>More Rare Treasures Are Being Shipped to the Chicago World's Fair</h3>
<p>Two Pairs of Jadeite Masterpieces</p>
<p>Last June, the most admired items at the Chicago World's Fair in the United States were our country's three unique treasures: the jadeite pagoda, palace lantern, and memorial arch. Now, it has been learned that a certain jeweler in this city, in view of the upcoming continuation of the fair in Chicago in June this year, plans to ship two pairs of jadeite masterpieces, worth a fortune and the result of ten years of painstaking research, to participate in the exhibition. One is a pair of flower baskets with chains, containing rare flowers, insects, and plants, named "Golden Jade Filling the Hall." The other is a pair of flower baskets with chains, containing rare flowers and birds, named "Wealth and Longevity." Their emerald color is pure and flawless, like the transparency of glass. They are truly top-grade yellow jade. As for their exquisite style and delicate carvings, they are breathtaking. What is even more commendable is that the chain rings of these pieces are all connected to the body, showing the ingenuity of the gods. It is now heard that these jadeite artifacts will first be displayed at Chengchangxiang Jade Shop, No. 43 Guangdong Road.</p>
<h3>The Chengdu Road Police Station Is Established</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, considering that the western district is vast and that commerce in the area has flourished in recent years, with residents gradually increasing, has decided that security matters should be given extra attention. The police force of the existing police stations is already sufficient to bear the responsibility of protection, but the jurisdiction of the Xinzha Police Station seems to be too broad. To prevent any potential gaps in coverage, a new police station has been built on Chengdu Road in a suitable location, forming a staggered relationship with the Xinzha Police Station. If any incidents such as theft occur in the Xinzha area, the two police stations can jointly respond more quickly and effectively. The construction of this new building began not long ago and has now been completed. The interior layout is also modern. Because it is located on Chengdu Road, it is named the Chengdu Road Police Station after the location. All Chinese and Western staff, from the police chief to the constables, have been selected and appointed by the Chief of the Police Department. It officially started work yesterday. It is heard that the jurisdiction is divided from the Xinzha Police Station and the Gordon Road Police Station.</p>
<h3>The Yong'an Company Robbery Case: Ten Criminals, Male and Female, Are Arrested in Western Shanghai. A Basket of Banknotes Was Hidden Under the Bed.  Making a Fortune, Spreading the News, The Thugs Were All Watching.｜Rumors About How Wang Baokang Got the Stolen Goods｜</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of December 6th last year, the Yong'an Company department store on Nanjing Road was robbed of 18,003 yuan in cash. The General Police Station, under the command of Chief Inspector Lu Liankui and other detectives, has successively arrested six robbers, including Yan Amao, Hu Songshan, Feng Zuowen, Pan Meimei, Lin Yunliang, and Lin Yuncai, and confiscated pistols and over 9,000 yuan of stolen money. This has been reported in this newspaper many times. Now, Lu Ying, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, stationed in the Western Shanghai area, along with Tang Bingxiang, the leader, and Gu Wentao, the inspector, and Song Chengfa, the sergeant of the Laborite Road branch of the Sixth District, have arrested another ten male and female criminals related to this case and recovered over 1,150 yuan in cash. The details are quite bizarre and interesting. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>A Tip-Off from an Argument</h3>
<p>On the night of the 4th of this month, Tang Bingxiang, the leader of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Sixth District of Western Shanghai, led various detectives, along with Inspector Gu Wentao and Sergeant Song Chengfa, to patrol Laborite Road. Suddenly, they saw four or five rickshaw pullers in a small porridge shop arguing with each other. Suddenly, one of them said, "Wang Baokang, Meng Guopei, Wang Jinkui, Zhou, etc. are all rich now." Leader Tang and others immediately went forward to inquire. It was claimed that Wang Baokang was one of the thieves who robbed the large sum of money from the Yong'an Company and is now hiding in Shudeli, Laborite Road. On the morning of the 5th, Leader Tang and others received a secret report that Meng Guopei, Wang Jinkui, Zhou Zhaoheng, and other criminals related to the robbery of the large sum of money from the Yong'an Company are now hiding in Shudeli.</p>
<h3>Disguised as Vendors</h3>
<p>Leader Tang and Inspector Gu reported the information to District Chief Tan, and immediately led detectives Sun Shucheng, Zhou Wenhai, Yang Zhongjin, Zhang Yuzhu, and Sergeant Song Chengfa, all disguised as vendors, to the address. They arrested Meng Guopei and Wang Qixian at No. 34 Shudeli, Laborite Road, Wang Jinkui at No. 49 Rongqingli, and Zhou Weitao, Zhou Weihong, and a woman, Zhou Wang, at No. 7 Fussenli, for a total of six people, and brought them back to the district. Over 100 yuan in stolen money was confiscated from the criminals.</p>
<h3>A Basket of Banknotes</h3>
<p>According to the woman Zhou, she is 51 years old, from Yancheng, and lives at No. 7 Fussenli. Wang Baokang is my common-law husband. He used to pull a rickshaw for a living and was very poor. Three weeks ago, I was sick and sleeping upstairs. My husband, Zhou Zhaoheng, suddenly saw a basket under Wang's bed, full of banknotes, all five-yuan and ten-yuan bills. Later, I questioned Wang about where he got so much money. Wang then said to my husband, "Don't say anything." Zhang Wang then gave my husband 1,000 yuan. Later, my husband counted the banknotes and there were only 910 yuan. Two days later, Meng Guopei and Wang Jinkui extorted 200 yuan by impersonating detectives. When a nephew died, over 200 yuan was used. Over 100 yuan was used to pay off debts. There are still over 400 yuan left, all with my husband. He has now fled to the French Concession. I really don't know where he is. Zhou Weihong is my eldest son, and Zhou Weitao is my second son. I also really don't know where Wang Baokang is.</p>
<h3>Writing Letters to Collect Gambling Debts</h3>
<p>According to Wang Qixian, he is 26 years old, from Shandong, and lives at No. 7 Shudeli. He works in a burlap bag factory for a living. Three weeks ago, my foster mother Zhou Wang said to me, "Wang Baokang is rich now. Why don't you go and collect the money he owes you?" After getting this news, because I lost to Wang Baokang at cards last month after work at the burlap bag factory, as a result, Wang owed me 320 jiao of small money, so I invited Wang Jinkui and Meng Guopei to go with me to collect the money from Wang Baokang. Wang said, "My foster father, Zhou Zhaoheng, is unreasonable. I already gave him 1,000 yuan, and he still took 500 yuan from my basket." At the time, Wang Baokang only gave me 40 yuan, which is true.</p>
<h3>Extorting Money Again</h3>
<p>According to Wang Jinkui, he is 40 years old, from Shandong, and lives at No. 7 Fussenli. Three weeks ago, Meng Guopei invited me to meet Wang Baokang at the Zhongtianfu Tea Garden on Laborite Road. Meng then impersonated a detective from the headquarters and said to Wang, "You are rich now. Be sensible, or I will arrest you and take you to court." After repeated entanglement, Wang gave 400 yuan. Later, they went to Zhou Zhaoheng's place and repeatedly threatened Zhou, and got another 180 yuan, for a total of 580 yuan. Meng took 150 yuan, Wang Qixian took 120 yuan, and I got 310 yuan. According to Zhou Weihong, 20 years old, and Zhou Weitao, 15 years old, both work in a burlap bag factory, Zhou Wang is their mother, and they don't know anything else. The detectives confiscated over 70 yuan in stolen money from the criminals.</p>
<h3>Stolen Money in the Cellar</h3>
<p>Soon after, a confidential informant reported that Wang Baokang was hiding the large sum of money at No. 20 Tianfunong, Tanzawan, Zhabei, at the place of his aunt, Wang Yang. After receiving the report, Leader Tang immediately led the original team of detectives and police officers from the Fourth District to the address. However, Wang had already fled upon hearing the news. Wang Yang, a suspect, and Zhang Shukui, a suspect, were arrested on the spot, and 480 yuan in original stolen money was unearthed from the cellar under the bed and brought back to the district. According to the woman, she is 40 years old. The money was sent to me by my nephew Wang Baokang. He left for Jiangbei the day before yesterday. I really don't know where the money came from. According to Zhang Shukui, he is 37 years old and used to be a factory worker. I was playing at his house and was arrested.</p>
<h3>Arresting People in Shanyang County</h3>
<p>After getting the confession, District Chief Tan of the Sixth District ordered Leader Tang to supervise the detectives and take Wang Yang and Zhang Shukui to Shanyang County, Jiangbei, on the 7th of this month, with a document, and work with the county to secretly go to Wang's house in Xujiazhuang in the countryside. However, Wang Baokang had already fled upon hearing the news. Wang's wife, Li, was arrested. According to Li, she is 20 years old. Baokang is my husband. On the evening of the 25th day of the tenth lunar month, I returned home from working at the Shanghai yarn factory. I heard people say that my husband was rich. I searched everywhere without success, and I became anxious and sick. My uncle sent me back to my hometown, but I couldn't find him. I only heard my uncle, Lu Wenbo, say that my husband had been there a few days ago and deposited 600 yuan with him. So I really don't know where my husband is.</p>
<h3>Banknotes in the Mud Wall</h3>
<p>The detectives then took Li to the flat in Lujiazhuang in the county and arrested Lu Yang, Lu Wenbo's wife. 600 yuan in cash was found in the mud wall, but Lu Wenbo had also escaped without a trace. Both women and the stolen money were taken back to the district. After District Chief Tan interrogated them separately, he ordered them to be sent to the General Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>The Reason for Getting Rich</h3>
<p>According to general rickshaw pullers, Wang Baokang got the large sum of money because when Yong'an was robbed, he happened to be parked there. A thief carrying the money fled and sat in his car and took it to the door of a foreign house (because he couldn't carry much in both hands). The patrolmen drove them away with sticks along the way. Wang then took this opportunity to escape back. When he arrived halfway, a rickshaw puller asked what was in his car. Wang said it was tin foil.</p>
<h3>Apprentice of Tailor Shop Dies Tragically, Stealing Suspected and Scolded to Death, Injury Found Behind the Head of the Deceased</h3>
<p>｜The Cause of Death Still Needs Autopsy｜</p>
<p>Shi Shaoxing, a 17-year-old apprentice from Haimen at the Xufutai Western Clothing Tailor Shop, No. 325 Fushoufang, Dalianwan Road, was usually very diligent in his work and of good character. However, he was recently suspected of theft and was severely scolded by Xu Chen, the shop owner's wife. From then on, he groaned in bed. The shop owner sent him to the hospital, but it was already incurable. He died. The police reported the investigation and took the body to the autopsy office. The First Special District Court's Prosecutor Guo found a wound on the back of the deceased's head after the autopsy, but because Xu Chen denied beating him, further investigation is needed. The woman was temporarily detained, and the police were ordered to investigate and verify the situation. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei, accompanied by forensic doctor and clerk, drove to the autopsy office on Fielun Road and ordered the gathering of a group of witnesses to continue the investigation. According to the report from the detectives of the Yulin Road Police Station, when the body of the deceased was taken out of the mortuary of the Sacred Heart Hospital, there was no injury behind his head. However, according to the report of forensic doctor Wei Ligong, the injury to the deceased was indeed sustained before death, and the wound was stabbed with something like scissors. If it were an injury after death, there would not be so much blood. Prosecutor Guo believed that the treatment of apprentices in old-fashioned shops was not civilized, which was a common practice and could not be denied. If an apprentice made a mistake, scolding and beating was even more common. Shi Shaoxing was found to have silver dollars in his shoes by the shop owner's wife, so he could not avoid being punished. He then questioned Xu Chen again and again, but she repeatedly denied beating him. The police investigation did not match the forensic examination, so the cause of death could not be completely clarified. It was then decided to send the injured part of the deceased to the Public Works Department's Hygiene Department for examination to determine whether the injury was sustained before or after death, so as to avoid wrongful conviction and value human life. The body was then released to the deceased's uncle, Shi Qixiang, who made a guarantee to take it away for burial. It is now known that Shi Qixiang believes that the forensic report is indeed true. His nephew, Shi Shaoxing, must have been injured by the shop owner's wife with sharp tailoring scissors and died. There is no doubt. Therefore, he has entrusted lawyer Wu Peng to handle the legal procedures against the shop owner couple yesterday.</p>
<h3>Dr. Liu Xianjie Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Aviator and aircraft manufacturer Dr. Liu Xianjie was ordered to go to Europe to investigate aviation and was entrusted by the General Staff Headquarters to investigate the fortifications of various countries. He has completed his mission and returned to China by the Coolidge ship from San Francisco last winter with friends via France, England, and the United States. Mr. Liu arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Representatives from various organizations and relatives and friends in Shanghai, about a hundred people, went to the new Customs pier to welcome him. Mr. Liu landed and shook hands with the welcomers one by one to express his thanks. He was full of energy and amiable. He then briefly talked to reporters about his experience in Germany and expressed his desire to devote himself to aviation and serve the country in the future. Because there were many welcomers, he did not have time to talk in detail and was taken to the hotel by relatives and friends. It is heard that he plans to go to Beijing to meet with the authorities in the next few days and go to Anhui Province to see his father and enjoy family happiness.</p>

<h3>Seamen's Party Branch Holds General Meeting of Party Members</h3>
<p>Elects Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Party Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch held its first general meeting of party members in the Shanghai area at the auditorium of the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch on Zhaojiabang Road, Laoximen, the day before yesterday. After the ceremony, the election supervisor Yu Jiayong gave a report, roughly divided into three points: (1) the revolutionary history of seamen in the past; (2) the mission of our party to lead seamen; (3) the sound organization of seamen in the future. He hoped that the comrades in the Shanghai area would work hard and be responsible to achieve the expected goals. Then, Wang Yalen, the director of the preparatory committee of the district, reported on the preparatory process and proposals. Then, Supervisor Yu designated two supervisors to check the party certificates and attendance certificates and issued election tickets for executive and supervisory committee members according to seats. As a result, Wang Yalen, Yang Youlong, and Wang Zhonggang received the most votes and were elected as executive committee members.

<h3>The Taihu Water Conservancy Association Plans to Dredge the Wusong River</h3>
<p>Requests Allocation of Cotton and Wheat Loans for Handling</p>
<p>The Taihu Basin Water Conservancy Commission believes that the Wusong River is a major drainage channel downstream of Taihu Lake, a major waterway between Shanghai and Suzhou and Changzhou, and that traffic is frequent. More than eight million acres of farmland in the counties along the river rely on it for irrigation. Its close relationship with the development of Shanghai's industry and commerce is even more important and needless to say. Since the Republic of China, it has not been dredged, the canal is blocked, and both agriculture and commerce are suffering. The commission, which is responsible for governing the Taihu Basin, has witnessed the difficult times and has prepared dredging plans and repeatedly requested funds to start construction. However, due to the empty treasury, it has not been implemented. Later, in April 1930, the Construction Committee invited various organizations to discuss the project plan and budget, which had been largely determined. However, due to the fundraising problem, it was not resolved and could not be realized. Now, the commission believes that the American cotton and wheat loans are specifically for rural use, and water conservancy construction is the top priority for rural revitalization. Moreover, the National Economic Commission has designated a part of the previous loan for water conservancy construction. The commission should prepare a dredging plan for the Wusong River and a budget, based on the original plan and taking into account the opinions of all parties. The commission has submitted it to the Ministry of Interior for forwarding to the government as soon as possible to allocate funds for construction.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Press and Other Companies Have Established Safety Subcommittees</h3>
<p>Labor-Management Cooperation to Promote Safety and Health</p>
<p>The Industrial Safety Association has recently been working hard on the safety work of its member factories. It has already passed the regulations on the organization of subcommittees in each factory at the last board meeting and has sent letters to each factory to actively prepare for the establishment of subcommittees to promote safety work in each factory. The organizational principle of the subcommittees focuses on cooperation between the factory and the labor union to jointly promote all safety and health work. In the past month, the Commercial Press Home Industry Society has established a safety subcommittee. The Zhonghua Book Company is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the factory at 3:00 p.m. today (the 17th). It is heard that other member factories of the association, such as Gongqin Iron Factory, Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, Tianchu Ajinomoto Factory, Zhenxing Textile Factory, Nanhua Rubber Factory, Hongxing Weaving Factory, Yihe Rubber Factory, and Dachina Welfare Rubber Factory, are actively preparing. Now, the association's regulations on the organization of subcommittees in each factory are as follows: (1) All member factories of the association may organize subcommittees in each factory to facilitate safety work.

<h3>Request for United Efforts to Eliminate Unlicensed Seafarers</h3>
<p>The China Marine Engineering Association sent a letter to the China Merchant Marine Captains Association, stating: Regarding the current regulations of the Ministry of Transportation, those crew members in the navigation and engineering departments who have not obtained licenses but have applied to the Ministry for examination within the specified time may be temporarily allowed to work. However, for others, as of November 30th of last year, the relevant maritime authorities should earnestly eliminate them and prohibit them from working in order to uphold the law. It has now been found that on various ships in Shanghai, many officers in the navigation and engineering departments have neither obtained certificates nor applied for examination, and the Shanghai Maritime Bureau has not complied with the order to eliminate them. Our association has repeatedly negotiated, but to no avail. Their intentions are difficult to understand. Currently, there are a significant number of licensed seafarers who are unemployed. If the bureau were truly diligent and devoted to public service, how could they be so biased? Now, for the sake of upholding the dignity of the law, our association proposes that the navigation and engineering departments cooperate and requests your association to send representatives to negotiate with the bureau on an agreed date and argue based on reason. As this matter concerns the development of maritime administration, we hereby send this letter, hoping that you will investigate and inform us of the names of the representatives and the date of negotiation as soon as possible and actively proceed with the matter.</p>

<p>The initiators of the China Leprosy Relief Association and the fundraising convention for the China Leprosy Sanatorium opened on the tenth of this month. The team leaders and members are raising funds separately and actively proceeding. It is reported that the general team leader, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, and the deputy team leaders, Mr. Xu Xinliu and Mr. Yan Fuqing, in order to connect the feelings of the teams and encourage work, have specifically scheduled a banquet for all team leaders, deputy team leaders, and staff on Thursday (the 18th) at 7:00 PM at the Shipping Club on the fourth floor of 10 Guangdong Road. It is said that invitations have already been distributed. It is also reported that the association's chief of staff, Zhu Shaoping, and general secretary, Wu Zhijian, have been contacting various parties in recent days, which has been extremely smooth. Minister Kong Xiangxi has generously donated one thousand yuan. Lin Kanghou, Pan Yangyao, Qiao Wentao, and others have all taken on the positions of team leader and deputy team leader, respectively. As for the announcement of the first solicitation, which was originally scheduled for today (the 17th), it has been changed to the 20th (Saturday) at 2:30 PM at the beautiful Ye Family Garden in Jiangwan because today falls on a Wednesday, which is inconvenient for all parties. Not only can the results be reported, but the garden can also be visited. At that time, Dr. Yan Fuqing, chairman of the association's preparatory committee, will provide refreshments and entertain all team leaders and members. The association will also provide transportation. Those who wish to ride can arrive at the Zhongshan Hall at 20 Bowuyuan Road before 2:00 PM this afternoon to gather and go together. Those who bring their own cars can go directly to the garden.</p>
<h3>Bingxun Shorthand Primer Published</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Haining Road Gaoshou Chong Bingxun Chinese Shorthand School recently printed a book entitled "Bingxun Shorthand Primer," which was published yesterday. It is simple, easy to learn, convenient, and accurate. One can learn on one's own without a teacher. Those who are illiterate can become literate, read books and newspapers after learning. Those who are literate can write faster after reading. It is truly a great contribution to Chinese culture. The book was written by Mr. Yang in memory of his uncle, Yang Chiqing, and costs only forty cents per copy. Mr. Yang lost his education at a young age, but fortunately, his uncle cultivated him frugally, which gave him the opportunity to study. It is reported that libraries and popular education centers in various places have been enthusiastically writing to the school to purchase the book.</p>
<h3>Family Industry Association Organizes Invincible Broadcasting Station Precursor</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Family Industry Association recently cooperated with the Lishudetang Broadcasting Radio Station to have the association take over all the hours from 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM daily as the Invincible Broadcasting Station, dedicated to promoting art and advocating Mandarin. The rest of the time is used for advertising by the Shudetang Advertising Department, which officially opened on the 15th of this month. At 12:00 noon on that day, a test broadcast was first conducted, broadcasting the Party Song and the Will, and other ceremonial programs. Then, the founder of the station, Mr. Li Ruijiu, gave a speech, saying, "Since the early days of the Shanghai broadcasting industry in 1927, our station began to use a 15-watt transmitter to broadcast. Gradually, we increased the power. Today, our station has a maximum power of 400 watts. Recently, we have received letters from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, all stating that our station's test broadcasts in the past ten days have been successful, with the clarity and loudness of the sound no less than that of the Central Station. Our station has been research-oriented for several years since its establishment and does not engage in business. However, our station seeks further development and expansion. Six months later, a transmitter ten times larger than today's will be installed. We have now received the official license No. 24 from the Ministry of Transportation. However, the construction cost required to build a great radio station is huge, and the recurring expenses are even greater. Although our station has never been in business, we have to slightly collect advertisements to subsidize it. This is the origin of our station's establishment of an advertising department." The Invincible Broadcasting Station is scheduled to officially open on the 20th of this month. From 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM that afternoon, famous figures from Shanghai will be invited to broadcast Peking Opera to add to the fun. It is expected that the beautiful songs and melodies, and the sounds of stringed instruments will create a grand scene at that time.</p>
<h3>China National Products Company Opens</h3>

Because it is the beginning of the opening, a large number of sacrificial products have been prepared and sold at low prices in order to arouse the interest of the people in using domestic products.</p>
<h3>Repeated Miraculous Effects in Treating Insanity</h3>
<p>Qiao Gengsheng and Two Others Recovered and Discharged from the Hospital</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine has a history of thousands of years and has considerable value in China. It seems impossible to abandon it for the time being. The Shanghai Insanity Special Hospital in Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, in this city, uses pills and decoctions that are purely traditional Chinese medicine to treat general insanity and all kinds of difficult diseases, and it can often achieve miraculous effects. Song Chengchang, the deputy director of the hospital, is proficient in traditional Chinese medicine and can carefully study the symptoms of insanity, which has greatly assisted the hospital. Other male and female nurses and assistants can also take care of patients meticulously without complaint. It is reported that the hospital has discharged three patients who have recovered this month: Shi Chen, a woman from Piaoyang (living on Sapo Sai Road in Shanghai), Zhou Sun, sent by the Huishan Police Station, and Qiao Gengsheng, an employee of the Shangnan Automobile Company. All three suffered from severe insanity, but were cured. Their families have taken them back one after another.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Song Park Road</h3>
<p>At the home of Cao Shiqi at No. 36 Song Park Road, Zhabei, at about 8:00 AM yesterday, several robbers suddenly broke in and took out a pistol to silence them. They searched and robbed at will.

<h3>Second Auction of Huang Chu Jiu's Estate</h3>
<p>The dispute over Tongde's creditor's rights has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Huang Chu Jiu's estate was previously auctioned by the Shanghai Second Special District Court. Except for the Rongqing Lane base on Gsufifei Road, which has been taken over, the remaining real estate and houses, such as the Western-style houses of Tongde Hospital near Fuxu Road, along with the base, were subject to a lawsuit filed by Tongde Hospital, requesting compensation for construction improvements and other expenses, so no one has taken over. This time, the Second Special District Court has scheduled a second public price reduction auction of the unsold real estate at 10:00 AM on the 19th of this month in the court. It is reported that Tongde Hospital is actively pursuing the lawsuit that has already been filed in order to achieve the purpose of compensation. Therefore, the dispute over Tongde's creditor's rights may not be resolved in the short term, and it will also affect the auction.</p>
<h3>Dr. Hou Yunfan's Honor</h3>
<p>Dr. Hou Yunfan, a physician at the Sacred Heart Hospital on Ningguo Road, is highly skilled in medicine and has extensive experience. For example, last month, Chen Qinglu, an employee of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, was stabbed three times, piercing his chest and stomach. Dr. Hou used his unique skills to remove the bullets and apply dressings to the wounds, finally bringing him back to life. The day before yesterday (the 14th), Chen Qinglu and his brother Qingfu specifically presented a horizontal plaque with the inscription "Profound Kindness of Re-creation," and the colleagues of the Materials Department of the Electric Power Company publicly presented a huge silver screen with the inscription "Miraculous Skills Return to Heaven" to Dr. Hou's new clinic at No. 450 Ximuqiao, Yinxianggang, at the end of Huade Road. Along the way, military music was played, and crowds watched. On that day, the guests who came to observe the ceremony included Qiu Qihua from the press, Liu Wenzao, the Chinese detective of the Yangshupu Police Station, Wilcox, the Western detective, Ji Zongsui, the lawyer, Zhou Chunfang and Zhou Chunkui, the Bachelors of Laws, and all the colleagues of the Materials Department of the Electric Power Company, as well as local gentry and directors, which was quite a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Coal Oil Assembly Workers' Union Established</h3>
<p>There are about 600 coal oil assembly workers in this city, who have never had a union organization, resulting in a lack of communication. The Coal Oil Assembly Workers' Union was established in mid-October of last year, and the inaugural meeting was held at the Jiangxinsha Meeting Hall in Gaoqiao, Pudong, at 4:00 PM yesterday. Long Peiyun from the Municipal Party Department and Gao Shuren from the Seamen's Union attended.

<h3>Dahyang Company Manager Beef Bone Marrow Powder</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Huanwen, the manager of the Dahyang Ice Company on Minkuo Road (near Jiumentou), previously obtained a secret tonic formula from the Mongolian Prince's Mansion, and after more than ten years of research and refinement, it was finally launched in recent years, called Beef Bone Marrow Powder. This powder has great efficacy in promoting blood circulation, strengthening the body, nourishing yin, and tonifying deficiency. It is extremely mild in nature, easy to take, and inexpensive, at four pounds per yuan. Men, women, old and young can take it. It is truly a wonderful product for winter health care. Especially at this time when we are advocating domestic products to strengthen the body and save the country, I hope that my compatriots will wash away the bad habit of liking foreign goods, abandon expensive imported tonics, and use this domestic product consistently, so that we can benefit the country and strengthen the body.</p>
<h3>Wufu Food Company Gifts New Foods</h3>
<p>The Wufu Company Food Company, originally located on the upper floor of 305 Aidoo Road, invented the Crispy Bean King, which is crispy, sweet, fragrant, and delicious, and there is a situation where supply cannot meet demand. It also produces Wufu Sunflower Seeds and Fruit Meat King. The taste of the sunflower seeds is similar to that of Sunflower Seed King, and the fruit meat is stir-fried by machine. The heating is just right, which is better than the peanuts on the market, so the business is thriving. Now, a distribution center has been opened at 215 Xizilaihuo Street, which also wholesales candy, biscuits, and various foods. On January 14, it opened, with a buy-one-get-one-free offer for five days. It is reported that customers are pouring in, and it is extremely crowded.</p>

<h3>Yong An Tang Asks for Prohibition of "Gai Pai" Pharmacies</h3>
<p>The Social Bureau Has Ordered Rectification of Names</p>
<p>Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, located on Ningbo Road in this city, found that someone had opened a Yong An Pharmacy nearby. They sent a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, stating that the Yong An Pharmacy was fraudulently registering a trade name and requesting the Bureau to prohibit its use. The petition stated that Yong An Tang was originally established in Singapore, and a branch was established in Shanghai in the sixteenth year of the Republic [1927]. The trademark and trade name were registered according to law, with trademark registration number 18273 and trade name registration number 340, both recorded in the Ministry of Industry and the Trademark Bureau. However, it has now been discovered that a Yong An Pharmacy has been established at No. 437 Guangxi Road, near Yong An Tang. Upon investigation, it is believed that according to Article 19 of the General Rules for Merchants (omission), the fraudulent use of the Yong An trade name is a clear case of unfair competition. Furthermore, according to the *Da Wan Bao* of December 5, the pharmacy was even found to be sharing profits with Dr. Li Jianfeng, selling drugs at high prices. The reports in the newspapers at the time led social figures to mistakenly believe that Yong An Tang was responsible, and many people called to inquire. Therefore, because of the fraudulent use of the Yong An name, Yong An Tang's reputation was damaged. It is urgent to prohibit this. Yong An Tang specifically submitted this information, along with a copy of the December 5 newspaper, requesting the Bureau to investigate and prohibit the pharmacy from using the Yong An trade name to prevent deception and avoid losses, for the sake of public convenience. The Social Bureau's reply is as follows: the submission and newspaper have been noted. The pharmacy has been ordered to change its trade name and report it for filing. You are hereby informed. This is the reply, with the newspaper kept on file. Director Wu Xingya.</p>
<p>City Sounds ▲ Shanghai Second-Hand Stores to Move to Nanjing Road – Eight or nine out of ten pawnshops in Shanghai were founded by Chaozhou people. It is estimated that there are several hundred pawnshops in Shanghai run by Chaozhou people. Each month, the pawnshops have piles of unredeemed items, including valuable diamond jewelry, clothing, and daily necessities of all kinds. A few years ago, a tycoon in the pawn industry, who was also from Chaozhou, gathered many fellow villagers to establish Shanghai's first second-hand store on Guangxi Road, specializing in selling unredeemed items from pawnshops. Although the goods are second-hand, they are refurbished to look like new. The prices are also very low, about half the price of those on the market. Moreover, the store’s principles are upright, and its credit is excellent. Since its opening, it has been well-received by society. Recently, imitators have sprung up one after another, showing that it is popular with the public and attracts attention. The store has now leased a new building next to Taichang, west of the Xinxin Company on Nanjing Road, to expand its scope. It is currently being renovated and is expected to move around the first month of the lunar calendar. Although it is during an economic downturn, it can be predicted that business will be booming in the future.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Having read the news section of your newspaper on the 16th of this month, there is a "Traffic Department Zhenru Power Plant Established" news item and the record is slightly inaccurate. Our radio station, in view of the fact that during the January 28 Shanghai War, the power poles and lines of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were often broken by artillery shells, causing frequent obstacles to the station’s reporting operations, a power plant has been approved to be built within the Zhenru reporting station. It can generate electricity by itself in case of a power outage in the city. The nature is only for standby. At ordinary times, the Zhabei company’s electricity is still used. Deeply afraid of causing misunderstanding, I hereby send a letter to your newspaper and request that it be included in the "Letters to the Editor" section for correction. Sincerely, Editor-in-Chief, *Shen Bao*, Traffic Department International Radio Station, January 16.</p>
<p>To the Editor: According to Xu Fusheng, the manager of the Zhongxin Weaving Factory, the victim in question, our factory was unfortunately and unexpectedly burned down by a reckless cook at about 6:00 PM on the 13th of this month, with all the factory's inventory, property, and more than 100 looms being reduced to ashes, resulting in a very heavy loss. However, upon reading the newspaper report on the fire at our place, the wording was inconsistent with the facts. Our factory has a wealthy capital and sufficient inventory. The burnt machine cargo can be tested for embers. The reports are enough to harm the factory's reputation. Lawyer is entrusted on behalf of the dispatch, requesting the newspaper to make corrections immediately, to emphasize the point of view. In light of this, I will respond on behalf. Please check and grant corrections. Sincerely, Editor-in-Chief of *Shen Bao*, lawyer Zhang Ji, January 16.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Natural Science and Society (II)</h3>
<p>Which science is more important and necessary?</p>
<p>｜Answer to Mr. Yu Wanwang (continued)</p>
<p>As for saying which science we should promote to save China's current predicament, this is still clinging to form and starting from personal subjective fantasy without grasping the facts. The current fact in China is that, on the one hand, the public should urgently learn social sciences to cope with the current historical mission imposed on the public, change the status quo, and open up a new situation; once the old obstacles are removed, we need construction, and what we urgently need are technical talents and natural science knowledge. Saving China is a whole project. Although in the previous stage (destroying the old) and the later stage (building the new), there seems to be some emphasis, as far as the whole is concerned, they are indispensable and inseparable. We really cannot promote one and put down the other, because if so, we will fall into fantasy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both sciences are urgently needed by Chinese society and occupy the same important and inseparable nature in the project of saving China.</p>
<p>However, in China's current situation, there is no environment for the development of natural science. The development of natural science is determined by the productive forces. China's current productive forces are restricted by production relations, that is, there is no possibility of progress. Therefore, in this garden, natural science loses its conditions for flowering. No matter how you promote it, fantasize, it is all useless. Without a huge industrial base, there are also no laboratories and test halls equipped for these industries. Without these material devices, no scientists will naturally emerge. The decline of natural science in China today is not without reason.</p>
<p>On the contrary, social science has now developed better, which is also due to the current Chinese practice, not due to human likes and dislikes, or subjective promotion.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can only say that studying social science now has better conditions than natural science; now, the objective reality has prompted the public to study social science.</p>
<p>As for which one should be studied from a personal perspective, that is a completely different question and does not need to involve whether the subject itself is important. Because when we study a certain subject, we mainly look at whether our environment is suitable. If you are suitable for studying natural science or social science, you don’t have to ask whether the science is important, just go ahead and study it. But you may think that we are ambiguous, because the environment suitable for studying a certain science has not been explained. Then we can specifically tell you: if you are a rich person, willing to serve, and at the same time lack the foundation and interest in natural science, then go and study social science; if you are very calm, have a foundation, and have the material conditions suitable for natural science, then go and study natural science. However, if you think that the study of these two sciences requires two different brains, you are completely wrong and misunderstand our meaning. The reason why we advocate this is in terms of personal aspirations and social effects. As for the attitude or spirit that should be possessed in studying knowledge, it is the same regardless of the subject.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we see that your letter seems to focus on the "career path" issue, and therefore associate it with the urgent need of the subject. We have to answer this question more ambiguously: whether you learn natural science or social science, there is no "career path," but there is a "career path." The reason is obvious, just take a look at the situation in the real society to understand.</p>
<p>Now we will summarize our main points: (1) There is no distinction between important and unimportant in learning; (2) Our study of a certain subject is determined by the social and personal environment; (3) The "career path" is not related to the subject of study. || Respectfully,</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Factions</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>Grouping without partisanship, partisanship without grouping. In the Three Dynasties, there were "groups" and "parties," but no "factions." In the twentieth century, there are "parties" but no "groups," but there are "factions." I wonder if the "factions" of the twentieth century are what was called "groups" in the Three Dynasties. I am afraid that this public case will be difficult to clear up even if the twenty-four histories of China and the West are turned over. Because in the ancient tombs of Lu and Yu provinces, no anecdotes about "groups" seem to have been excavated.</p>
<p>Let's put aside "groups" and "parties" and talk about the most fashionable "factions" of the year.</p>
<p>In the political sphere, there are the "left-wing," the "right-wing," and also the neither left nor right, awkward "neutral faction." There are the "new faction" and the "old faction," and at the same time there is the neither new nor old "conciliation faction." Therefore, if there is no faction, then there will be three factions. But in the United States, there is the "dry faction" that advocates prohibition and the "wet faction" that advocates lifting the ban on alcohol, but there is no neither dry nor wet "fence-sitting faction." This is an exception.</p>
<p>In China, it is even more interesting. The loud and cheerful Peking Opera naturally belongs to the "ancient faction." The civilized drama that does not jump, does not sing, and does not wear painted faces naturally counts as the "new faction." But between these two factions, there is another faction, neither ancient nor new, which is not called the "neutral faction," the "conciliation faction," or the "fence-sitting faction," but instead it is called the "Shanghai faction." Although this also divides the world into three in the opera world, the name "Shanghai faction" seems somewhat irrelevant to the other factions.</p>
<p>Those who practice acrobatics have the "Wudang faction" and the "Shaolin faction," but the third faction has set up its own banner and is called the "Jianghu faction." Speaking of this "Jianghu faction," it is an all-encompassing group. Catching teeth worms and fortune-telling is the "Jianghu faction," and treating camels is also the "Jianghu faction." Spending money when you have it, and showing off when you don't is indeed the "Jianghu faction," and playing with a large goldfish bowl in your crotch is also the "Jianghu faction." The three religions, nine streams, and eighteen tunes can all be classified into the "Jianghu faction." The "Jianghu faction" naturally does not only represent those who practice acrobatics. This shows that the composition of "factions" in China is "another faction," not the red-haired ghosts, quick-legged ghosts, etc… whose backs can be seen.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Western Music</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>"Though I am not as intelligent as Shi Kuang, I understand the refined meaning from hearing string and song." Zhou Yu's words are truly wonderful! We are naturally not as clever as Zhou Yu, but when we look at (not listen to) Chinese and Western music, we can also taste its refined meaning!</p>
<p>▼Huqin and Violin. The huqin and the violin are both stringed instruments. But those who play the violin are renowned musicians whose voices captivate audiences, poets, and professors at music schools. Those who play the huqin are laborers singing bawdy songs, blind musicians accompanying courtesans, mischievous children, and delinquents. It's not that the huqin is inferior to the violin. The violin is a foreign thing, and foreign things should be lucky. The huqin, however, is a naturalized domestic product, and Chinese things should be unlucky.</p>
<p>▼Flower Drum and Dancing. On the street, idlers form a circle, leaving an empty space in the middle. Several women dressed in red and green twist their waists and sing in shrill voices. Gongs and drums are played softly. Respected gentlemen smile with disdain. When officials arrive, they fine and expel them. The flower drum is harmful to public morals. But the piano, with its bold and healthy style, is placed in luxurious dance halls and played melodiously. Couples dance on smooth floors like celestial beings. Joyful but not lewd, sad but not wounding, dancing is considered a noble entertainment. Because the flower drum is Chinese, and the piano is Western.</p>
<p>▼Chinese and English. Chinese lyrics should also be unlucky. Those who sing Chinese songs are primary school students, those who sing "Lotus Clapper" are beggars, and those who hum "Drizzling Rain" are prohibited. Singing folk songs in front of moralistic gentlemen will surely result in a slap in the face. However, college students love to hum famous English songs. So-called Harmony's four-part harmony is not much different from the harmony of "Lotus Clapper," yet four-part harmony is used in solemn auditoriums. As for Western love songs, like the famous "How Can I Leave You?", not only is no one prohibiting them, but some people are even promoting them.</p>
<h3>Four Manshus</h3>
<p>— Chun Liu</p>
<p>Manshu is the so-called Manjushri, a figure in Buddhist scriptures. Some also associate it with the establishment of the Manchu state two hundred years ago, so the name "Manchukuo" is a transliteration of Manshu. The ancestors of the Aisin Gioro clan wanted to use Buddhist power to stabilize their state's foundation, but it seems no one talks about it.</p>
<p>Since the appearance of the remarkably talented and beautiful Su Manshu in the literary world, people have felt a mystical meaning in the word "Manshu," as if this name is more refined. As far as I know, there are actually four Manshus in the world. Besides Xiangshan Su Manshu, there are two monks also named Manshu. One was recently expelled from Baiyun Mountain in Guangzhou. He is from Sichuan and once studied at the China Inner Academy, where he was a disciple of Ouyang Jian of Yihuang, along with Chen Mingshu. He loved to write screen couplets for people. There are four screen paintings he wrote on the upper floor of Ji Ming Temple in Nanjing, which reads "Monk Manshu of the Four Emei Mountains." The other is from Xinghua and once stayed at Pilu Temple in Nanjing. He is over sixty years old and also likes to compose poems, but they really don't have much poetic flavor.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a Manchu named Manshu who once wrote a book called "Tian Zhi Ou Wen," which specializes in describing the old customs of Beijing. His writing style is very elegant and pleasing, but his era is earlier than these three Manshus.</p>
<h3>Moonlit Night</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhong</p>
<p>At night, carrying a lonely heart, I walked alone up Mount Wutai.</p>
<p>The bright moonlight shone down softly, very bright and very peaceful, like a spring night. But the bald treetops and the patch of withered yellow grass clearly told me that it was already early winter.</p>
<p>Mount Wutai is not very high, strictly speaking, it can only be considered a mound. It is surrounded by deep, dense forests. On the top of the mountain lies a vast, desolate meadow, quiet and secluded. It is simple and pure, like a village girl. What's more, there is a crescent moon, curved like moth eyebrows, shining its clear light across the clear sky.</p>
<p>This place is located in the center of the capital's urban area. In theory, there should be many citizens who are weary of the city's bustling life and need this quiet place to lie in the embrace of nature and enjoy its great caress! However, besides my lonely figure, there is no one else here. Is this beautiful scenery and wonderful time arranged for this solitary wanderer to enjoy alone?</p>
<p>Deep indigo villages lie scattered and dormant in the night. Occasionally, one or two starlight fires flicker between the farmhouses.</p>
<p>At Confucius Temple: Perhaps the intoxicating Jazz King is being screened in the cinema, and perhaps the mesmerizing "Traveling Dragon Playing with Phoenix" is being sung at Tianyun Pavilion! The young masters are probably indulging in singing and dancing at this moment!</p>
<p>The strong electric light of the probing lights, like a strong swimming dragon, contains great ambition and searches the wilderness for its purpose of aggression, constantly sweeping over from the imperialist warships at Xiaguan.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it seemed like some voices were coming from the left corner. Passing around a row of trees, under the faint moonlight, a young couple sat side by side in a grass pavilion.</p>
<p>The rustling cold wind blew sharply.</p>
<p>"Cold?" "My love!"</p>
<p>"No, I don't feel it at all!"</p>
<p>Tender greetings scattered in the quiet night air, very light and very beautiful. The girl lowered her head, looking at the large, desolate meadow in front of her. On the meadow, the moonlight and dense fog merged into one, drifting white and misty.</p>
<p>Everything was silent. But is this a time for silence?</p>
<p>"What a beautiful moonlit night!"</p>
<p>Looking... slowly one hand bent over, hand in hand, the flame of youth burned fiercely in the hearts of the young couple, two bodies moved, two souls danced together, two people hugged tightly!</p>
<p>What a sharp demonstration to a lonely wanderer. Holding my wounded heart, I sneaked back along the slanted path.</p>
<p>Spoiled children of love, I wish you eternal happiness!</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty: Whispering Before the Lamp, Painstakingly Instructing the Weak Child; Leaning on a Cane to Wander Down the Mountain, Observing Heroes with a Cold Eye</p>
<p>When Zhao Weng heard what he said, he thought he had seen the women being teased on the platform, so he made some remarks. Now the more he spoke, the more complaints he had, and he himself was drawn into the vortex, clearly directing his remarks at something. This was quite puzzling, so he looked at him and said with a smile, "Mr. Gan, did you also fail because of some love affair?" Only then did Ji Zhi realize that the woman he could not get was this old man's daughter-in-law. How could he clearly say it out? He smiled and shook his head twice and said, "It's not worth talking about! Don't mention it, let's sit and drink a little and look at the red leaves." If he hadn't said this, Zhao Weng would have thought he had guessed a little. Now that he didn't want to delve deeper, Zhao Weng understood that there was a great secret inside. Talking was naturally out of the question, but he couldn't forget this matter in his heart.</p>
<h3>Chapter Twenty-Three</h3>
<p>The Pain Is Unbearable, Listening Attentively to Drums and Music; The Joyful Feeling Is Not Satisfied, Hastening to Part with a Flying Talisman</p>
<p>At this moment, Ji Zhi realized that he had spoken too quickly. How could he complain about his son's affairs in front of his father? So he smiled at Zhao Weng and said, "Old master, I was out of my mind just now, you don't have to believe those words. When young people have a woman, many storms will arise. Without a woman, they will become jealous when they see other people's women." If he hadn't clarified, Zhao Weng would have been suspicious, but after he clarified, Zhao Weng was even more suspicious. His wrinkled face turned red, and the few white pockmarks hidden inside his skin were all highlighted. (293)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>A Certain Blind Man</h3>
<p>— Hui Jian</p>
<p>In this village, no one knew him, and no one knew where he came from. His eyes were dull, his fixed eyeballs, white with circles of blue, just like the eyes of a dead fish we see on a plate, completely fixed.</p>
<p>When he first came, he lived in a dilapidated Earth God Temple. Later, he was taken in by Liu Village, but was soon sent back to the Earth God Temple. The reason was that Mr. Four in Liu Village discovered his Shandong accent and questioned him about his origins. He refused to say a word, but rudely asked Mr. Four and everyone else:</p>
<p>"Do you know if Marco Rishi is still alive?"</p>
<p>Mr. Four asked in surprise, "Who is Marco Rishi? Who is Marco Rishi? What is his relationship to you?"</p>
<p>He was silent and smiled, his smile filled with sarcasm and arrogance. Mr. Four suppressed his anger and gave him a satisfying lunch, hoping to get some truth from his generous treatment, but after he was full, he patted his stomach and asked:</p>
<p>"Does anyone do a good deed and tell me... is Marco Rishi still alive?"</p>
<p>Mr. Four sent him back to the Earth God Temple, saying, "If you don't let me know who you are, I won't help you."</p>
<p>He did not resist this treatment. He smiled and returned to the Earth God Temple, found the niche where he used to sleep, and quietly lay down by himself.</p>
<p>Every day at a certain time, he came out to beg for food. He wrapped himself in a dirty, ragged robe covered in clumps of rotten floss, and held a walking stick made of pine branches less than two feet long.</p>
<p>He listened carefully to the footsteps of all passers-by. He had the special wisdom to distinguish what kind of person each footstep belonged to. He sometimes stretched out his other free hand to stop the kind person he imagined, but he did not ask for money but said urgently:</p>
<p>"Sir, tell me, is Marco Rishi still alive?"</p>
<p>People pushed him away impatiently, and walked away quickly, or left a copper coin in his hand, telling him, "I don't know who Marco Rishi is, just as I don't know who you are."</p>
<p>Then he sadly retracted his hand, turned his lychee-like eyes, and returned to where he was standing, smiling bitterly.</p>
<p>Once he had finished touring the village, and almost everyone had been troubled by his Marco Rishi question, he officially visited Mr. Four of Liu Village, asking him to provide him with a last amount of dry food, and explaining that he was about to leave the village immediately.</p>
<p>"Are you going to continue looking for your Marco Rishi?"</p>
<p>Mr. Four asked him.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm looking for him. I've been looking for him for five years, and I can look for him for another five years. In this remaining painful life of mine, only he can save me..."</p>
<p>Mr. Four unexpectedly became clever and quickly asked him, "Save you! I know; is he a foreign ophthalmologist?"</p>
<p>"An ophthalmologist, yes, and a missionary. Xu Laojiu in our village told me this. He saw with his own eyes this foreign doctor cure two blind people in Macheng. He just poured a little yellow water from the silver bottle and washed it on their eyelids, and in less than three days, they could all see. That foreign living immortal doesn't want us to repay him, maybe he just wants me to convert... I'm willing, I've learned it, singing hymns, if he is willing to cure my eyes, I can sacrifice anything."</p>
<p>Hearing these magical words, Mr. Four became even more excited. Based on his suspicions, he blurted out, "I'm very surprised. I've also been to Macheng, and not only have I not heard of such an ophthalmologist, but even Marco Rishi, this name is very unfamiliar to me. Can you believe that Xu Laojiu would not deceive you?"

<h3>Progress of Education in Zhejiang Province in the Past Six Months ▲ Director Chen Reports to the Provincial Government ▲ Quality and Quantity Have Increased</h3>
<p>Chen Bulei, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, reported to the provincial government yesterday on the work of the department in the past six months, stating briefly that the department regarded promoting the improvement of local education in various counties and cities as an important part of its work. The education in counties and cities in the past six months can be divided into two aspects: quality improvement and quantity increase. Regarding quality improvement, the important aspects are the three types of methods promulgated by the department, namely: (1)</p>
<p>Randomly test primary school students. All students in grades three and above in primary schools are tested as necessary, based on the inspection results of inspectors in various counties and cities, either temporarily in each school or in a gathering in one place, to conduct random tests of the students of the school, but in order to understand the actual performance of a certain grade or subject in the entire county, a general random test can also be held by region. (2) Encourage teachers to continue their studies. Teachers' further education methods are divided into four categories: A. Gathering further education, such as holding holiday lectures, primary school subject research meetings; B. Reading further education, such as organizing reading clubs, setting up correspondence research departments, placing mobile libraries; C. Observation further education, such as going abroad to visit teaching demonstrations, holding exhibitions; D. Others, such as special topic discussions, celebrity lectures, etc.; (3) Train primary school principals, also divided into four points: A. Study and implement various education laws and regulations, and various administrative orders related to education; B. Lecture on the most needed subjects in recent education; C. Based on the inspection results, for common or special shortcomings, matters that should be corrected, and improvement methods; D. Discuss how to closely connect with the society and the public. The above methods stipulate that each county and city should hold at least once a year. As for the promotion of quantity, it is also divided into three items: (1) Increase the number of township primary schools. In the past six months, 269 townships in various counties without schools have increased their number, and 187 townships with schools have expanded their number. (2) Consolidate school funds and school property. The education funds of various counties in the province were originally extremely strained. Now, affected by the rural economic decline, they have been tightened repeatedly. At this unavoidable time, in terms of opening up sources, we can only follow the provisions of Article 2 of the Administrative Yuan's Measures for Guaranteeing Local Education Funds, and request the provincial government to designate and allocate 20% of the newly added local taxes in the future to fill local education funds. This case has been approved by the provincial government and agreed by the Finance Department. (3) Stipulate supervision methods. The Education Department recently promulgated the "Measures for County Education Bureau Chiefs to Go to the Countryside for Inspection." The matters to be paid attention to during the inspection include eight points, the most important of which are A. Convene township chiefs and deputies in the locality to hold talks or meetings on promoting the increase of schools and enriching enrollment; B. Examine the inspection reports of county supervisors or instructors as the basis for formulating the next inspection plan; C. Examine the education status of various townships and districts, plan to raise funds and promote consolidation; D. Visit gentry who are enthusiastic about education and exchange opinions on improving education.</p>

It is said that the team's soccer skills are usually known for their strength in Australia, and the players are physically robust, weighing about 160 pounds each. They are expected to return to China around June or July of this year.</p>

The final between the two teams is scheduled for the 30th of this month. Other teams, such as Green and Red, have each lost once. Southeast Jia has been losing ground recently, and its championship hopes are dashed. However, the Lu team's basketball skills are improving daily, and the final game between the Lu team and Meifu on February 2nd is also very significant in determining this year's champion.</p>

<h3>▲ Results of Last Night's Two Games</h3>
<p>Two West Qing basketball games were played last night: (A) Xiaguang defeated Nanxing, 37 to 28. Xiaguang's basketball skills have improved, and Lin Qiren's shooting accuracy makes him a promising newcomer. (B) Feixia defeated Wanxing, with a score of 39 to 30. Feixia won Division B2.</p>
<h3>▲ Xiaguang Defeats Nanxing</h3>
<p>Xiaguang's main player Chen Baoqiu was unable to participate due to unforeseen circumstances, significantly reducing the team's strength. However, having recently received heartfelt instruction from Pirates' main player Carson, their skills have improved day by day. In last night's game against Nanxing, Lin Peisen attempted a long shot after the start, opening the scoring. Lin Qiren revealed his talent, displaying his outstanding skills, scoring three consecutive goals. Nanxing managed to score two goals through Zhang Daqi, and Guan Xuanan combined offense and defense, adding two more goals, taking a commanding lead of 12 to 2. In the first half, Xiaguang led 16 to 14. Maintaining their form, they continued to compete. Lin Qiren was suddenly ejected for a foul, and Nanxing seized the opportunity to advance, bringing the score to 34 to 28. Fortunately, Xiaguang had ample substitutes, and they ultimately won with a score of 37 to 28.</p>
<p>▲ Xiaguang Fouls Score ▲ Nanxing Fouls Score</p>
<p>Zhang Rende 2 4 Bao Xindi 1 4</p>

<p>Total 12 37</p>
<h3>▲ Feixia Defeats Wanxing</h3>
<p>Feixia had more evenly distributed talent, taking a lead of 23 to 15 in the first half. At the start of the second half, Wanxing mounted a combined defense and counterattack, bringing the score to 22 to 23. However, due to poor coordination, they ultimately lost with a score of 39 to 30.</p>
<p>▲ Feixia Fouls Score ▲ Wanxing Fouls Score</p>

<p>— ▲ Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Yesterday was the start of the Shanghai Basketball Association's B Division front portion. In the five games, the match between Nanguang and Feifei was evenly matched, with Nanguang leading by one point at 8 to 7 in the first half, and ultimately winning by only two points at 18 to 16. However, the performance was mediocre and not particularly exciting. The other games were all one-sided, with teams like Xiaguang and Youai showing remarkable play. The results are as follows:</p>

<h3>Jinan Winter Ball Games: Nine Classics Wins Senior Basketball Championship</h3>
<p>Finals Result in 23 to 18 Victory Over First Strong</p>
<p>Two Armed Athletes Clash in a Fierce Battle</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) The peaks of Thousand Buddha Mountain are covered in pure white snow, contrasting with the green pines and cypresses, unfolding a natural painting. The thin sunlight breaks through the morning mist and slowly rises. The crows on the trees also fly and caw. This is truly a "winter morning" at the sports field.</p>
<p>The winter ball games initiated by the Provincial Stadium were originally scheduled for seven weeks but were extended by two weeks due to rain and snow. Apart from the junior basketball championship won by Rural Teachers and the junior football championship won by Donglu, and the senior football championship won by Jingcheng, only the senior basketball finals between Nine Classics and First Strong were held today (the 11th). With the final battle concluded, the event reached a successful conclusion, and the winter ball games came to a complete end.</p>
<p>This morning at 9:30, the two teams met at the Provincial Stadium. The Nine Classics team, representing the 20th Division's mortar regiment, consisted of tall and strong players. Since their debut, they had fought dozens of battles, encountering no worthy opponents. The First Strong team, representing the 1st Regiment of the Pistol Brigade, was short, agile, and had long enjoyed a prestigious reputation in Jinan. The clash between these two armed athletes on the field, vying for the championship, was expected to be intense.</p>
<p>The strength of both sides was balanced, with the lead changing hands frequently. First Strong's Wang Shengcai played like a dragon or tiger, shooting from both long and short distances with ease, increasing the score steadily. Seeing their performance faltering, Nine Classics shouted encouragement. Guo Xiushan launched subtle and overt attacks, quickly reversing the decline. Nine Classics became increasingly brave, while First Strong repeatedly failed to score, gradually losing ground. At the end of the first half, the score was 17 to 11, with Nine Classics taking the lead.</p>
<p>After a break, First Strong regrouped and vowed to counterattack with all their might. Hei Shigong scored first under the basket, and Wang Shengcai made a solo raid, returning in triumph. At this moment, Nine Classics ambushed from all sides, regaining two points. Strong soldiers pressed into First Strong's territory, with shouts of men and horses and the sound of drums ringing. First Strong repeatedly replaced players, and although there was a slight improvement, the deficit from the first half was too large, and it was difficult to recover lost ground. The entire game ended with First Strong winning the second half 7 to 6, but the final result was 23 to 18, with Nine Classics winning the championship.</p>
<p>▲Nine Classics Fouls Points ▲First Strong Fouls Points</p>
<p>Luo Rong One 2 Wang Shengzi Two 10</p>
<p>Xiushan 0 12 Wang Zhiren One 3</p>

<h3>Report on Vocational Education from Education Ministry Specialist's European Study</h3>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>Within the French vocational education system, there is a system of inspectors. Inspectors are assigned to each province or district. Their duties include inspecting school affairs and serving as a liaison between schools and the economic and industrial sectors, as well as consulting and discussing matters with the central Ministry of Education's supervisors. These inspectors are familiar with local conditions and understand the inner workings of schools. Their insights and ideas are often relevant and key, making them a significant aid to the recent development and notable success of French vocational education.</p>
<p>French laws stipulate that all vocational school administrators must have close contact with the economic sector, and all teaching staff and factory training instructors must spend part of their school holidays visiting manufacturing factories for observation or practical training to ensure that school and factory methods align with current trends.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, vocational schools are indeed school organizations that are good at adapting to the environment, full of activity, and evolving with the times. Only in this way can they operate smoothly within the national economic life, facing ever-changing and complex conditions.</p>
<h3>Vocational Education Organization</h3>
<p>The French vocational education organization is divided into two departments: employment guidance and vocational training. Vocational training is further divided into three levels: apprentice training, middle-level cadre training, and senior-level cadre training. The training work at each level is either undertaken by the government or organized by private individuals.</p>
<p>Nearly 80% of the national population works in the industrial sector. To have the government bear the entire responsibility is economically unrealistic, so it is necessary to encourage and motivate multi-faceted cooperation. The following is a description of schools jointly run by the French central government and local or provincial governments, such as municipal administrative committees or provincial administrative committees, followed by schools run by private individuals.</p>
<p>(1) Employment Guidance</p>
<p>When male and female students across the country leave elementary school at the age of 12 or 13, they, or their parents, must be given detailed guidance regarding future employment paths, career advancement opportunities, physical and intellectual requirements, and difficulties. This guidance, according to the provisions of the 1922 decree, is the responsibility of the employment guidance bureaus established in various regions, which provide the public with the necessary knowledge for employment.</p>
<p>To ensure detailed work, the employment guidance bureaus must cooperate with the following departments: (1) elementary school teachers, who provide information on students' usual intelligence and conduct; (2) doctors, who examine students' physical fitness; (3) labor union introduction agencies, which report on the local demand for artisans, so that young people can avoid mistakenly entering fields with oversupply and be guided into careers with better prospects.</p>
<p>In 1928, the Institute of Employment Guidance was established in Paris, dedicated to the investigation and research of employment guidance issues to achieve perfection. Currently, there are over a hundred employment guidance bureaus established nationwide in France, demonstrating the importance attached to this issue by the French authorities in charge of vocational education.</p>
<p>(2) Vocational Training</p>
<p>(A) Apprentice Training</p>
<p>Any young person who has just left elementary school and wants to learn a craft to make a living must receive apprentice training. Therefore, those from poor families enter factories or shops, while those from slightly wealthier families enter apprentice schools. Both are places for apprentice training.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Beijing School and the Shanghai School</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Congwen, in the 32nd issue of the literary supplement of the Dagongbao, spoke freely about the ugliness of Shanghai School writers. He said that the combination of "reputation and talent" and "commercial competition" constitutes our current concept of the term "Shanghai School." … Let us extend it, "opportunistic," "weather-vane," … this is what is called the Shanghai School; gathering some new literati, meeting together, or talking about Greece and Rome, or talking about writers and women, … getting some money from the government, then eating, drinking, and organizing some literary gatherings, recruiting disciples, deceiving readers, … this is what is called the Shanghai School. Emotionally leaning left, brave as a lion, but immediately surrendering and confessing when the situation is wrong, and identifying and harming friends, seeking credit and profit, this is what is called the Shanghai School. Because of a thirst for fame, using various methods outside of their works to flaunt themselves … this is what is called the Shanghai School." He concluded, "Harming the health of new literature, making literature itself weak and powerless, causing the general public to lose the necessary understanding of literature, and often distorting the meaning of literature, and making some young people who are about to engage in literature not focus on practical efforts, thinking that being a celebrity is admirable, not working hard at writing but first trying to be a writer, all of this is the style of these Shanghai School writers." The sins of the Shanghai School are so heinous that even the darkest curses to curse its demise would not be excessive.</p>
<p>However, is today's "Beijing School" different from the "Shanghai School?" "Beijing School" and "Shanghai School" were originally terms in Chinese drama. The Beijing School can be said to be classical, and the Shanghai School can be said to be romantic. The Beijing School is like a lady from a noble family, and the Shanghai School is like a modern girl. "My friend" Mr. Xin Zujian, in discussing Beijing and Shanghai, said, "The Beijing School artist has Dr. Mei to represent, and the Shanghai School artist has Master Liu who is undoubtedly the one." If a lady from a noble family can ridicule a modern girl for showing off her style, then the modern girl can also retort and mock the lady from a noble family for being outdated. If Dr. Mei laughs at Master Liu for selling primitive heads, Master Liu will certainly accuse Dr. Mei of not understanding the Renaissance. Let us discuss the current situation of the Beijing School. Dr. Hu Shi, a brilliant member of the Beijing School, also talks about the history of philosophy, also talks about literary revolution, also runs independent reviews, also rushes around on the Baoding road. Is he different from what Mr. Shen Congwen calls opportunistic? I say: There is no difference. The Shanghai School pretends to be refined, either talking about Greece and Rome or talking about writers and women; while the Beijing School monopolizes refinement, either holding hundredth-week or thousandth-week memorials for Byron, or composing dozens or hundreds of regulated poems in the style of "Autumn Thoughts," confined in a glass room, isolated from reality; are they different from each other? I say there is no difference. Shanghai School writers get some money from the government, organize some literary gatherings, recruit disciples, eat and drink; Beijing School writers get some money from some cultural foundation, travel abroad wildly, and talk about culture; are they different from each other? I say there is no difference. "Once you become a writer, you are not worth watching," all crows are black, and there is no distinction between the "Beijing School" and the "Shanghai School."</p>
<p>Therefore, it is certain that the Shanghai School writers are all bad. However, modern girls wearing high heels walk on the streets, walk in the markets, and walk in the parks; they are always social and in contact with society. Shouldn't those ladies with bound feet hiding in their boudoirs be ashamed? Mr. Shen Congwen wants to call on the Beijing School to sweep away the Shanghai School. I am afraid it is too early to say so! I think tomorrow's critics will definitely not stand in the camp of the Beijing School. Only by adopting a sweeping attitude towards the Shanghai School that goes beyond disregard and contempt, and bravely sweeping away both the Shanghai School and the Beijing School, can we open up the path to new literature!</p>
<p>China today still has no great writers, nor great critics; the lonely literary scene does not allow critics to show their faces, which is why the diary-keeping school is so popular for a time! Alas!</p>
<h3>The "Supra-Morality" of Art</h3>
<p>— Tang Jun</p>
<p>The "morality" mentioned here refers to the "morality" recognized by "ethicists," "jurists," or the "Bible."</p>
<p>Originally, this issue was no longer an issue in Europe, but Chinese culture has not made progress for a long time. Although China's modern art movement has had a history of one or two decades, to this day, the general public cannot have a correct and appropriate understanding of "nude art." Furthermore, I heard a friend say, "Nude art" is still subject to various social criticisms, so I can't help but want to revisit this old topic and ramble a bit.</p>
<p>The word "morality" already represents something vague and uncertain in common sense. In the art world, it has long changed its original image ｜｜ the image defined by "ethicists," "jurists," and the "Bible." For example, killing is immoral, but a executioner killing a condemned criminal is moral. Knocking down walls is immoral, but some construction workers dismantling walls and even destroying all the magnificent buildings in a finished grand exposition is moral. Looking at Baudelaire's expression of "vice," Zola's depiction of "madness" and "suffering," Rodin's nude female statues with "legs apart and exposed genitals," etc., they have all shattered the stereotyped morality! Their works have all gained immortal value, which shows that morality in art has lost its importance and has become a meaningless thing!</p>
<p>Most superficial people take the morality or immorality of the "subject matter" of art as the basis for art criticism, which is really absurd! Because certain religious or war-themed works can lead the world to religious ideals and beliefs, as well as martial spirit or anti-war concepts, they say that the value of art lies in these moral themes. Because certain descriptions of "licentiousness," "madness," "violence," "theft," or other "vices" may have the danger of leading people astray, they say that this immoral temptation is the reason for the decline of art's value. These are the slogans shouted by the "ethicists" who look dignified and the "priests" who recite the Bible.</p>
<p>However, an artwork is not a "self-cultivation class" ｜｜ "ethics," nor is it a "law" or a "Bible." The "artist" is not an "ethicist," a "lawyer," or a "priest"; how can he be compared with a general model!</p>
<p>Artists have no obligation to persuade people to do good, nor do they have the desire to tempt people to do evil. They do not show their skills in the morality or immorality of the subject matter, but they discover themselves and recognize others similar to themselves through the intensified efforts of creation. They frankly and honestly, without any concealment, depict as much as possible what they feel, whether it is "licentiousness," "jealousy," "theft," "adultery"……… It is considered finished. They do not consider the results of external "feelings" and "influences"! They do not want people to praise them as "sages" or "geniuses"; they are not afraid of people's "sneers," "criticisms," and "curses."</p>
<p>In short, the "morality" that ordinary people consider important has no power in art.</p>
<h3>Monologue</h3>
<p>— Miao Chongqun</p>
<p>When the night is quiet, I often cannot sleep. My dry eyes hurt when they are open, and they also hurt when they are closed. Anyway, whether they are open or closed, it is the same in the darkness. I don't want to see anything anymore. Light has hurt my eyes and exposed all my bad deeds.</p>
<p>During the day, my mood is irritable, and I cannot be peaceful more than anyone else. For a little incident, I scold and roar. Sometimes I even smash a teacup, and then I smash two more glass cups. My face is flushed, and I am panting. I don't care if the neighbors are laughing at me next door. Only when I have finished venting do I feel a little calmer.</p>
<p>I can't say what the object is. I have nothing of value, only accompanied by a wife who suffers from the same pain as me. She also has no fate that is more fortunate than mine: toiling, suffering, and struggling with the remaining strength: although we eat porridge in the morning and porridge in the evening, it is still difficult to get the rice needed to make porridge.</p>
<p>There is no reason when I roar, but my wife sobs silently on the side, which somehow aroused my tyrannical curses again.</p>
<p>Only those who pursue light are originally people without light;</p>
<p>Now, the night has come, and the neighbors' snores, like the roar of cattle, come from next door. It shows its power, making me feel jealous like fire from the bottom of my heart, but helplessly, I can only toss and turn on the bed, gently, and yet afraid of waking up my wife beside me.</p>
<p>｜｜A poor woman! I seemed to be secretly calling her name in my heart. You are at peace when you are resting. Forget about the things of the day. People who live in the darkness also do not know what is called darkness.</p>
<p>From time to time, my wife suddenly rambles in her sleep. Vaguely saying intermittent sentences, with her heartfelt confession and resentful tone, every word seems to have a great stimulation for me.</p>
<p>I concentrated on listening, and I repented myself, unable to distinguish a single word. I repented sincerely.</p>
<p>Sleep talking is the words of her soul. She doesn't know that her long-depressed soul is talking to me in the dark.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>"Wake up! Wake up!" After being awakened by my wife, I still heard the lingering sound of my crying. I touched my wet face, and I didn't say anything.</p>
<p>Because my wife didn't ask anything either, it made me feel very embarrassed. She doesn't know that her sleep talking made my soul repent, but she also doesn't know what is going on with the person who appears on the human stage as a clown during the day and sobs like a woman at night.</p>
<h3>Wells' Prophecy: A Record of the Sino-Japanese War in 1935 (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhen</p>
<p>As a result, Japan gradually became tired of the war. Farmers only saw their sons go out to join the army, but they didn't see them come home. Coupled with the general shortage of supplies and the scarcity of strong men, disasters occurred. By 1935, there had already been a strong movement for a ceasefire. Later, several strikes occurred in Nagoya, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries. In order to purchase military supplies overseas, Japan needed cash, so it tried its best to dump goods abroad. But apart from this, now grains from Canada and the United States, and meat from Australia, have become necessary for Japan. The war thus caused panic in Japan and turned most of China's productive capacity into nothing. During the European war, Germany had an economic miracle, but Japan's social structure was too primitive. It was impossible for Japan to fight difficulties like Germany. Japan's bonds thus continued to fall in price, and even providing a high interest rate of 1.4 to 1.5 cents could not borrow money. But the war still showed no signs of ending.</p>
<p>The Japanese warlords had reached the point of being unable to stop. The people's curses against the war became more and more intense day by day. The United States, Russia, and European countries stared intently. In order to break through this difficult situation of exhaustion and isolation, Japan decided to make a final effort and invade the central part of China with a large army ｜｜ Hubei. After huge preparations, Japan mobilized all the people who could fight to the front line. Japan's military plan was to "strike at the heart of China." So it concentrated on Hubei from three directions: Nanjing, Shandong, and Guangdong. The reason why the Japanese army was divided into these three fronts was to maximize the plunder of materials from the Chinese countryside.</p>
<p>At this time, railway transportation was difficult to maintain, and most of it was non-existent, so transportation was very inconvenient. Therefore, when the Japanese army passed through the border of Hubei Province, one-third of its entire army had to engage in the construction of military roads like a long snake. Under such transportation conditions, naturally the light and heavy artillery that Japan could transport to attack Hubei was not much better than that of the Chinese army. Moreover, behind the Chinese army, there were abundant resources from Sichuan and assistance from Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>The three Japanese armies eventually surrounded Wuchang. This was like a loose ring, which was once gradually tightening, but soon stopped. This was the result of the soldiers being exhausted to the extreme. Therefore, the Japanese encirclement failed to succeed along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The New Year of 1938 arrived, and Japan was waiting for a victorious war report at home. But from the crescent-shaped long trenches, there was no news. Thus, a year passed in vain.</p>
<p>In July 1938, dysentery and bubonic plague broke out in the Japanese army. The epidemic was very severe, and the Japanese military doctors used all their abilities but still failed to achieve any effect. Therefore, from the beginning of 1939, Japan began to retreat to Nanjing. Because the transportation routes were disrupted everywhere, the losses were very heavy. The truth about the Japanese army's retreat is still known today. In short, of the more than two million troops, less than half were healthy and unharmed when they retreated to Nanjing. The blow that hunger inflicted on the Japanese army was actually more severe than the attacks of the Chinese army and people. Because they were extremely exhausted from hunger, many fell dead on the road of retreat. The reason why there were so few Japanese soldiers taken prisoner at that time was because the Chinese army did not have food to feed the prisoners. The Japanese army thus retreated to Nanjing under the attack of hunger, fatigue, and epidemic, with no more than 100,000 people. The roads were littered with the corpses of soldiers, and there were still giant tombs in the areas of Puqi and Qizhou. Due to the great flood, many soldiers were submerged at the bottom of the rivers.</p>
<p>Not long after the remaining Japanese troops retreated to Nanjing, a mutiny broke out, with soldiers shooting officers and joining forces with the Red Army coming from Hangzhou, China. At this time, Japan was at war with the United States, and the people at home rebelled because of the hardships of life. Major cities such as Osaka and Nagoya fell into the hands of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>The breakdown of diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States was due to the United States supplying submarines, mines, and other military equipment to China, and Japan had repeatedly protested. Since Japanese transport ships were sunk at the head of the Bohai Bay, the feelings between the two countries became increasingly dangerous, and war became inevitable. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (8) (8)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>"This is a Hublot (porthole)," Bill replied.</p>
<p>He pointed out the thick glass window that could withstand violent impacts and explained in detail how to close the porthole. This time Roland asked:</p>
<p>"Is the pharmacy also set up in your room?"</p>
<p>The doctor opened a cabinet, revealing compartments of glass bottles, each with a square white paper label on which was written the name of the medicine in Latin.</p>
<p>He took down a bottle and described the nature of the medicine contained therein, then the second bottle, then the third bottle. He simply gave a lecture on the method of treatment, and everyone seemed to be listening very attentively.</p>
<p>Roland shook his head and said:</p>
<p>"Is this very interesting!"</p>
<p>Someone gently knocked on the door.</p>
<p>"Please come in!" Wall called out.</p>
<p>Then Captain Boqiru appeared.</p>
<p>He extended his hand to shake hands and said:</p>
<p>"I came late because I didn't want to disturb you."</p>
<p>He also had to sit on the bed. Then the silence started again.</p>
<p>However, Captain Boqiru suddenly listened attentively. Through the cabin boards, he heard the order to prepare to set sail outside, and he reported:</p>
<p>"If we want to watch you leave the port on the 'Pearl' fishing boat and say goodbye to you at sea, then we should leave."</p>
<p>Roland took this matter very seriously. Undoubtedly, he wanted to attract the attention of the passengers on the "Lorraine." He quickly stood up and said:</p>
<p>"Then, goodbye, my child."</p>
<p>He hugged and kissed Bill, and he kissed Bill's cheeks. Then he opened the door.</p>
<p>Mother Roland did not move, with her eyes lowered, and her face was unusually pale.</p>
<p>Her husband took her arm and said:</p>
<p>"Okay, hurry up, we can't delay for a minute."</p>
<p>She stood up, walked a step towards her son, and stretched out her waxy white cheeks to him one by one. He did not say a word and kissed him once. Then he shook hands with Mrs. Lutsui and shook hands with his brother and asked:</p>
<p>"When will you hold the wedding?"</p>
<p>"It has not been fully decided yet. We will take advantage of the time when you turn back to Havre to hold it."</p>

<h3>March Term Spot Gold Initially Weak, Then Recovers</h3>
<p>On-floor Trading Depressed by Rise in U.S. Official Fixed Gold Price</p>
<p>Subsequent Vigorous Short Covering Leads to a Two-Dollar Rebound</p>
<p>The gold market was active yesterday for the March term spot trading, initially weak but later firm (hitting a low of $665.50). Including the forward premium, the final result was higher than the previous close. News that the U.S. government would fix the net gold price at $34.455 starting March 16 caused a temporary dip in on-floor trading. However, Western merchants engaged in short covering. Moreover, if the dollar's gold content is reduced by 40% (dividing 2.067 by 6, resulting in a 60% dollar composition), the pure gold price appropriately equals $34.455. Current buyers were then eager, as the forward premium favored bulls and reduced risk, resulting in a firm market. Initially, the overseas silver market saw increases in both London and New York. The Far East Exchange quoted future silver prices at only 1 to 7 cents, but exchange rates were significantly extended. Additionally, American cotton rose by 46 points, American wheat by 3.5 cents, and stocks by $4.53. Gross profit retreated to within $70, but sentiment remained positive, once rising to $71. A Reuters dispatch from Washington reported that President Roosevelt addressed Congress, proposing a monetary bill including the transfer of Federal Reserve gold reserves to the Treasury Department, the abolition of gold coins, a ban on all gold circulation, unlimited purchases of foreign gold, and the issuance of interest-free banknotes. These unfavorable telegraphic reports caused a drop to $65-66. Subsequently, the foreign exchange market tightened abruptly, and vigorous short covering led to a rise above $70. At noon, the market hovered within the $70 range. Later in the day, continued demand for U.S. currency settlements led to a tighter domestic market. Slightly more favorable news from abroad, coupled with active short covering by major players in the market, including speculators like Mr. Lu and Mr. Luo, ultimately resulted in a rebound. The scalper price was $1,060. Here is a summary of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The morning opened at $666.50. Including the forward premium, this was a drop of approximately $5.70. Physical goods opened at $6.50. In the foreign exchange market, the opening price for recent sales was one shilling and four and 3125/10000 pence for British currency and $34.875 for U.S. currency. Pan Ken was eating May U.S. dollars at $93.75, and the Shanghai Citibank was stuffing the same price, so on-floor trading was unstable, struggling around $6. Bing Xing Yuan, Kang Xiang, Heng Yu, Heng Xing, Qing Fa, and Yong Da Lian Gang competed to advance, invigorating the market. Pan Ken ate May U.S. dollars at $87.5. In a split second, Citibank scraped the same month at $68.75, jumping from $5.50 to $71.60. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank announced a rise of 125 for British currency and an increase of 625 for U.S. currency. Heng Yu and Yuan Chun sold out. Citibank and Hua Bi offered March U.S. dollars at $25, causing a drop to $68.20. Later, Zheng Jin scraped May U.S. dollars at $81.25. Mai Jia Li offered the same month at the same price. Ri Chang, Zhi Feng, and Yong Na stipulated, while Yi Feng and Yong Yi Yu sold, so the market struggled around $9, with an uncertain situation. Subsequently, with the vigorous purchase by Yuan Mao, Yong Heng Xing, Yuan Sheng, and Yong, the price recovered to $70.07. Hui Xiang Yuan and Kang Xiang divested, causing another drop to $67.50. Da Fa, Yong Heng Xing, and Qian Chang Xiang took advantage of the low price to advance again, rising to $70.05. The noon close was $670.20. After the close, although Hua Bi scraped April for half a dollar, physical goods vigorously suppressed the price, resulting in a lower price. Physical goods were auctioned at $69.20.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $669.80. Physical goods opened at $9.40. Heng Xing immediately advanced upon entering the floor, rising from $9.60 to above $71. Mitsui also scraped May U.S. dollars at $75. Later, although retail physical goods were sold, Fu Yu, Yi Yu, Da Lian Gang, and Qian Chang Xiang all advanced, and the silver company stuffed May U.S. dollars at $68.75, stabilizing the situation. Yuan Chang, Yong Hong Xing, and Yi Feng Yong Heng Xing stipulated, rising to above $3. Later, Yong Feng, Zhao Feng, Chang Heng Xing, Heng Yu, Fu Chang, Heng Xing Yuan, and Da Cheng all purchased in droves, rising again to $4.20. Hua Bi stuffed April U.S. dollars at $25. Yuan Mao Yong, Da Xing Yong, and others sold stipulations, falling back to $2.70. Sheng Da, Heng Xing, Heng Yu, and Shen Kang advanced again, rising again to $4.20. Bing Xing and Yi Yu divested, causing a drop to $3.50. Sentiment remained positive, and the close rose to $674.20. After the close, initially low but later firm, physical goods were auctioned at $4. Finally, Heng Yu Yi Da Yong Yuan Mao Yong stipulated, still above $4. An examination of the day's activity shows a highest price of $674.60 and a lowest price of $665.50, a difference of $8.70. The final result, including the forward premium, was a rise of $2.</p>
<p>The benchmark price, due to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's U.S. currency quotation increasing by 625 to $34.50, implied a spot gold price of over $695. Based on the closing price, approximately $1.0 was suppressed, approximately $1 less than the previous close. The book entry for this month was $693, February was $684, and March was $670. The morning make-up price was $693, and the afternoon make-up price was $697. The scalper price was $1,060. Customer gangs made some purchases. Ying Feng Heng and others sold to the Tianjin gang for delivery in three weeks at a price of $1,061.50 to $63, with approximately one thousand taels traded. Trading the February rolling over the March term, Heng Xing Run Chang Yu and others offered to pay $13.5, while Yi Feng Yong Zhi Feng Yong Da Lian Gang and others offered to pay out. Later, the price rose slightly, but Yi Feng Yong Fu Chang Yuan Heng sold out. Fu Yu offered Yuan Heng seven stipulations, totaling $15. Later, Yi Feng Yong Yuan Sheng Yong and others eagerly offered to pay, while shorts like Bing and Da Xing Yong were not interested, resulting in a downstream trend. Finally, the market was around $13.5. The Guangdong gang shorts remained inactive. There were 1,841 stipulations remaining for this month.</p>
<p>On-floor trading was quite active. In summary, Sheng Da Heng Xing Hong Xing Da Fa Yong Yuan Chun Zhao Feng Chang Yuan Chang Yong Yuan Sheng Yong Qian Chang Xiang Yi Yu Yong De Qing Fa Yong Xiang He Xie Xing Yong Wan Xing were among the buyers. Da Xing, Yong Shun Li Heng Tai Yuan Mao Yu Feng Yong Hui Xiang Yuan Feng Yong Si Da Fu Tai Heng Da Chang Xiang Yuan Xing Yong Heng Tai were among the sellers. Heng Yu Yuan Mao Yong Zhi Feng Yong Da Chang Xiang initially sold and then advanced. Fu Chang Da Fa Yong Yi Feng Yong Yuan Heng initially advanced and then sold. Da Lian Gang Shun Li jointly traded over 2,900, canceling over 200 stipulations. Wan Xing jointly traded over 2,500 stipulations, canceling over 100 stipulations. Guang Gang Heng Xing advanced over 1,000, selling over 300. Sheng Da advanced over 700, selling over 200. There were 7,714 stipulations remaining for February, and 34,895 stipulations for March.</p>

Compared to the previous close, British was stable while U.S. was firm by 3125/10000. Unfavorable foreign news led to continued loosening. The market situation was uncertain. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank quoted a rise of 125 for British currency, an increase of 625 for U.S. currency, a fall of 10 francs for French currency, an increase of 75 for Indian currency, a fall of 1 shield for Dutch currency, an increase of 25 for Singapore currency, a decrease of 1 mark for German currency, an increase of $1.25 for Little Luzon currency, and no movement for Hong Kong currency.

Transactions in the Small General Association amounted to over 700,000. The amount of bank collections is gradually decreasing, likely due to the approaching end of the accounting period.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Shows Signs of Sluggishness | Reduced Trading, Fluctuating Prices |</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw the market tend towards a spiral path, with the trend being extremely sluggish and trading sharply decreasing. News of the situation was dull, with everyone wanting to wait for the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang to predict victory. However, the reporter believes that if the Fourth Plenary Session is held on schedule, then the results of the meeting can be resolved to be certainly satisfactory. It is heard that the session will definitely be held on schedule, and the Southwest has also sent representatives. The situation ahead has shown progress. There are still many doubters in the market, so there are many unreliable bulls who are leaving the market. There is still an addition of shorts for speculation, but for the firm part, the shorts do not dare to short again, and the bulls are not willing to easily let go. Therefore, the market was found to be spiraling and extremely sluggish throughout the day. Each plate fluctuated by only one or two dimes, and the rises and falls were inconsistent. Trading also sharply decreased, with only a small number of rollover trades. The afternoon close was slightly firmer by one to four dimes. The trend is temporarily feared to have no large rises and falls. The final market price had more falls than rises, with a difference of only three or four dimes. The total transaction volume was 8,557,000 dollars, including 2,000 dollars in spot goods. The total number of futures salt taxes was 3.63 million, disarmament accounted for 1.7 million, the 19 Customs increased tariff accounted for 470,000, the 20 roll 20 Customs increased tariff accounted for 1.01 million, the short gold consolidated tax accounted for 880,000, and the 96 also accounted for over 460,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Soars</h3>
<p>A New Fong Foreign Firm report from the 15th states, "The New York stock market soared by five dollars. The fluency of trading has also been the greatest in six months. It is because Roosevelt spoke about reducing the dollar's composition, and the price of gold by the Financial Recovery Association will also be increased to 34 dollars and 45 cents the next day, causing buy notifications to spread throughout the country. The market's transmission machine has repeatedly fallen behind. Steel stocks and automobile stocks compete for market leadership. The demand for gold mining stocks is also strong. However, alcohol stocks are not very firm because the government has prosecuted and pursued taxes from them for tax evasion during prohibition. The rise in bonds is the sharpest in months. US government bonds are also very powerful. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 3.74 million shares. (Wheat) soared by four dollars, with a continuing upward trend. (Cotton) The market rose because the price of gold will rise the next day. Roosevelt's comments were considered good, but not necessarily good for the bulls. The market has a rumor that the government is supervising the goods exchange. The bulls were very eager to leave the market. The Financial Recovery Association's price of gold purchase was 34.06 dollars per ounce, unchanged." The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrials 103.19 Up 4.52</p>
<p>Twenty Railroads 44.26 Up 2.64</p>
<p>Twenty Utilities 26.7 Up 1.81</p>
<p>Forty Bonds 86.99 Up 0.47</p>
<p>Eleven Commodities 52.9 Up 1.86</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn and Cotton Struggle to Keep Up with Rising American Cotton</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. Although overseas cotton prices rose, and there was news of extended silver prices, it was still difficult to raise public confidence. The market's real demand remained calm. All regions had economic difficulties and weak purchasing power, so new buyers were very scarce. However, the rising cotton market made factories feel particularly difficult.</p>
<h3>New Spot Auction Lacks New Buyers</h3>
<p>At the opening of the spot auction in the morning, the buying atmosphere was slightly more intense due to the rising cotton markets in India and the United States, with each month rising by 6, 7, and 9 dimes.

<p>Mainland 175 Nanjing 3 Zhenjiang 18</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell. The rise of American cotton was quite strong, and Indian cotton also followed suit. The market atmosphere should have the power to rise. However, exchange rates were extended, the yarn market was depressed, and the distant months were approaching around 43 yuan. New speculators were slightly interested. At the same time, the bulls also profited. Therefore, the market was found to be relaxed. However, it is said that the amount absorbed by the Ningbo gang has not yet been released.</p>
<h3>Zheng Spot Good, Then Retreats</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng spot market in the morning, it rose with the foreign cotton, and the buying atmosphere was stronger, with each month rising by 1, 2, and 3 dimes.

<h3>American Cotton Jumps by Over Forty Points</h3>
<p>▲ December term already out 1.2 Dime Pass</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was vigorous and strong due to everyone buying in, good news from Liverpool, and political news favorable to the bulls. As a result, spot goods rose by 40 points, and futures rose by 38 to 46 points. Liverpool cotton spot goods rose by 7 points, and futures rose by 6-7 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 12 points. The Bombay cotton market was sluggish due to hedging the Aumra cotton, but later, the shorts compensated and returned to firmness. As a result, Pingar rose by 4.5 rupees, Aumra rose by 1.75 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose by 3.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (15th electricity):</p>

<h3>December 1933 Foreign Cotton Import Statistics</h3>
<p>In December 1933, the quantity of foreign cotton imported into Shanghai was 34,975 pieces of American cotton, 22,773 pieces of Indian cotton, 1,150 pieces of Egyptian cotton, and 14,100 pieces of Burmese cotton.</p>
<p>Food</p>
<h3>Spot Flour Soars, Term Wheat Light and Firm</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month saw a soaring trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat saw Chicago rise by $1.23 and Canada rise by around 60 to 70 cents. Moreover, due to reports that the U.S. President had a plan to raise prices, public sentiment was shaken after the opening price, and the price was invisibly increased. Also, due to major bullish players continuing to absorb near and distant terms, the market was particularly sharp. By the time the afternoon market opened, the sentiment for near and distant terms was further improved. This month rose by 1.925 cents, which was 3.5 cents higher than the previous day. Each month was also 1 cent better than the morning. Later, due to a small number of factories making a slight offer, and the selling price of Tianjin spot goods also being flat, with the battleship opening at 3 dimes for small goods and the gun carriage opening at 2 and a half dimes, public sentiment also turned mild. As a result, this month was 2.5 cents higher than the previous day, February was 1.75 cents higher, March/April was 1.5 cents higher, May was 1.75 cents higher, and June was 1.5 cents higher.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month had turned profitable. However, the transactions in each board were still extremely light. Partly due to the lack of chips and partly due to the decline in speculation, the market was slightly driven up by the high price of foreign wheat and the turning price of flour, but most of the transactions were still light. As a result, this month did not open, February was better by 5 cents, and March was better by 7 cents. The rest did not open. The current wheat was not opened because the standard had improved and the goods were sold by the customers.</p>
<h3>Early Late Rice Weakens by Several Points</h3>
<p>Glutinous Rice and Fancy Goods Remain Stable</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources of each gang are particularly scarce due to rain and snow mixing the day before, with only 17-18 boats (over 2,000 stones). Although the route is limited, it seems to be a stable situation. Chang Gang, Su Tong Gang, Nan Gang, and other glutinous rice are all collected by the store stomachs on this street, and the market prices have not risen or fallen. Only Qing Jiao and Si Jing's high-quality late rice were difficult to raise the customer prices, so the prices were still several points lower. The West Lian Zhong Guan goods were in line with the customers' intentions, and the market color was actually beautiful. The rest, such as Songjiang and Feng Jing goods, only had zero stomach movements, and the sales were not many. According to statistics, the whole city's stomach packed Dalian, Weihaiwei, Qingdao, and other gangs imported a total of 1,340 packs. Each gang's Du Jian had no great honor or disgrace, and the foreign pointed rice was slightly softer by several points. The cloudy change yuan route was slightly wider, and the current situation was tight.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There were 26-27 arrivals from various places. Although the weather was cloudy, there were still transactions for each good in the market. White glutinous rice, white yuan rice, and each pointed rice were similar to yesterday, and each had no honor or disgrace.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Goods Owners Call for Higher Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of Ke Xian was very good. Because after the pacification of Fujian, the Ke gangs from Fujian province first purchased and transported the goods. All Chinese ships were restored, and the previous deposits of the Fujian gang had been fully paid for. Yesterday, they continued to ask about the market. The owners of the goods called for higher prices by 1 dime due to the small amount of deposits and arrivals, so they were unable to handle it as much as possible. Fuzhou Gang only responded to 200 packs of Hunan red rough rice at a price of 5 dollars and 58 cents, and 200 packs of Mingguang machine rice at a price of 6 dollars and 45 cents. Other transactions were not concluded. Ningbo Gang also moved yesterday and handled 200 packs of Jiangxi machine late rice at prices ranging from 7 dollars and 5 cents to 6 dollars and 55 cents. 275 packs of Hunan machine oil were priced at prices ranging from 7 dollars and 5 cents to 6 dollars and 95 cents. The market prices were all 6-7 cents higher than the selling prices of the previous day. At the moment, the Fujian stomach is very greedy, and there are not many arrivals and deposits, so the future situation is still looking good.</p>
<h3>High-Grade Soybeans Rise Uniquely</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market continued to rise, and market sentiment was optimistic. Upper-middle grade goods rose by four to five cents, and lower-middle grade goods also increased by three to four cents. High-grade goods rose unusually. The outflow was due to the continuous rise in telegrams. Various parties adopted the measure. It is estimated that the Fuzhou gang purchased one cart of Zhengyangguan soybeans with good appearance and color for 3 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2.5 fen. The Xinghua gang purchased 100 bags of upper-middle grade goods at a price of 3 yuan and 6 jiao. Three carts went from this street, priced at 3 yuan, 5 jiao and a half to 5 jiao. Two carts were purchased from the mainland, priced at 3 yuan and 5 jiao to 4 jiao and a half. In addition, one cart of Feihe soybeans went from this street, priced at 3 yuan and 5 jiao and 7 fen. One cart of Bengbu soybeans, priced at 3 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. In the mainland, 500 bags of Guide soybeans were traded at a price of 3 yuan and 5 jiao. One cart of Yingzhou soybeans, priced at 3 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. Factories bought three carts of Haozhou soybeans at a price of 3 yuan, 4 jiao and two to four fen. Two carts of Bengbu soybeans, priced at 3 yuan, 3 jiao and 3 fen.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Dutch Red Rises Five Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The guild's marked price for No. 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods was 18 yuan, 8 jiao and 7 fen, which was not achieved. Re-export goods were still marked at 6 yuan and 3 jiao. Dutch red rose by five cents, No. 9 at 15 yuan and 4 jiao, and No. 8 at 15 yuan, 1 jiao and a half. Re-export goods rose by one cent to 6 yuan, 7 jiao and 6 fen. Taikoo sugar decreased slightly by one jiao, B mark was 19 yuan and a half, CW mark was 19 yuan, 3 jiao and a half, lower grades remained unchanged, DY mark was 19 yuan and 2 jiao, HX mark was 19 yuan. Zhenji cotton white remained unchanged, No. 1 at 17 yuan and 9 jiao, the rest remained the same. More than a thousand packages of Chaoqing arrived the day before yesterday, and it is estimated that trading can begin today, with prices expected to remain tight. More than 500 boxes of sliced ​​Qing were opened yesterday, rising by one jiao to 8</p>
<p>yuan and a half, Gaozhuang sugar strips Qing at 8 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3>Dried Longan Flesh Is Exceptionally Sluggish</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been slight continued arrivals of old Guiyuan dried longan flesh. Although the stock is not much, sales from all parties are extremely sluggish, resulting in most of the goods arriving from previous and current stores not being sold. The current store is very willing to sell at a discount, but the brokers' bid prices are too far apart, making it difficult to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3>White Tung Oil Declines in Hankou Market</h3>
<p>｜Hongxiu Oil Opens in Shanghai｜</p>
<p>White tung oil rose last week due to the strong buying by foreign firms in Hankou, and the market price rose from 23 yuan to 25 yuan per dan. After this rise, the foreign firms withdrew again. Just as new goods from various producing areas were being sold vigorously, the arrival of goods in the Hankou market was naturally not small. Once the foreign firms slowed down, the market became depressed, and prices gradually declined. According to the Hankou telegram the day before yesterday, the price had fallen to 22 yuan and 7 jiao. The rise was rapid, and the decline was also sharp, and there is still a tendency to continue to fall. Judging from the situation, a drop to 12 yuan is likely in the near future. Zhejiang tung oil is also in peak production. In the past few days, based on the Hankou market, it was sold at 20 yuan, 3 jiao and 4 fen per dan, delivered in Hangjiang Qian. The fleeting boom has become a thing of the past, and now it has returned to 19 yuan, 3 jiao and 4 fen. The firms in this port jointly purchased nearly 10,000 dan this time. Now, due to the sluggish market, they have all stopped buying. However, the accumulated stock is already not weak. Xiuyou Wanxingyu, known for its top-quality products, opened 300 to 400 barrels the day before yesterday, priced at 29 yuan, 7 jiao and 8 fen. Dayouheng, Jifengheng, and Zhaoli all reduced their prices as usual. Hongjiang tung oil, Jiying, also opened at 22 yuan, about 1,000 barrels. Xiangtaifeng was reportedly secretly purchased by various firms and has been fully sold.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3>Sales of New Lead Wire Are Booming</h3>
<p>Recently, the Fujian and Zhejiang authorities have been purchasing new lead wire, so transactions are very prosperous. It is estimated that the quantity opened yesterday reached as many as five to six hundred dan. Most of the buyers are military personnel. The colors are mostly No. 8, No. 10, No. 12, No. 14, and other varieties. There are very few decorations in No. 16 to No. 25 and other colors. Because the end of the year is approaching, there is no news of price increases.</p>
<h3>Pure Antimony Breaks Through the 300 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been no major progress in the transaction of pure antimony, but the arrival of goods is abundant, and the inventory is rich, so people's hearts are unusually tired. Therefore, the market price has broken through the 300 yuan mark. It is estimated that each ton is sold for 298 yuan, which is another 2 yuan lower than before. Transactions involving printing houses and type foundries have slightly inquired, but other firms have not been involved.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>European and American Silk Telegrams Do Not Turn</h3>
<p>(New York's Current Silk Inventory Increases Significantly) The silk sales of various silk weaving factories in New York were sluggish last winter, the consumption of raw silk decreased significantly, and the year-end stock of silk was quite high. Since the beginning of the year, the import of Japanese silk has still been strong. Various silk and sock factories have controlled production and reduced work, resulting in a significant increase in the stock of current silk on the market. Yesterday morning, American silk merchants received a telegram from the New York silk market in early January. The total stock of raw silk in the city (as of January 10) reached 120,937 bales, of which Japanese silk accounted for slightly less than 110,000 bales, Chinese silk 5,039 bales, and silk from Italy, France, and other countries more than 5,000 bales.</p>
<p>(Silk Merchants Take Advantage of Low Prices to Purchase Factory Stock) The supply of raw silk in overseas markets exceeds demand, and the silk stock of various silk weaving factories is sufficient to meet demand, so there is no interest in purchasing more. European and American silk telegrams have not turned, and the sales of foreign firm silk are as sluggish as ever. Only the spring sales of inland silk doors have started. In view of the fact that the price of white factory stock has fallen to the lowest limit, silk merchants from Xun, Zhen, Shanghai, and other places have taken advantage of the low price to purchase 90 bales of grade B spot goods. French firms have also purchased 20 bales, which are said to be spot goods transactions, and the price is still weak.</p>
<h3>Moroccan Tea Market Reports Decline</h3>
<p>According to recent news from Morocco, the green tea market is currently exceptionally sluggish. The stock of Chinese Luzhuang, Tuzhuang, and Pingshui green tea is no less than 40,000 boxes, and Japanese tea also has 20,000 boxes. Due to the low-price competition of Japanese tea, the price of Zhenmei pearl tea in China has fallen by more than 30 francs per dan. Therefore, British and French tea merchants are adopting a cautious attitude towards the future of their business, resulting in Shanghai Tuzhuang old green tea being completely ignored.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>"Eunuch Tide"</h3>
<p>— Li Qi</p>
<p>In 1934, on the eve of the war, genitals suddenly became important international "fetishes"! Initially, Mr. Hitler, in order to reduce crime among the small populace and for the sake of "superior races," forcibly eliminated the reproductive functions of many people in Germany. Soon after, for the sake of law enforcement, he subjected a German man who had raped a young girl to castration. Recently, in the state of Michigan in the United States, nearly a thousand boys and girls have had their reproductive functions eliminated. The fact that parents of these children were induced to sign consent forms has aroused widespread criticism. Whether it is the elimination of reproductive function, which does not hinder sexual desire, or the "root and branch" castration, it is always a partial or complete castration of the sexual organs. Therefore, I collectively call it the "Eunuch Tide."</p>
<p>There must be many who approve of the elimination of reproductive function from the perspective of "eugenics." At the same time, there must be quite a few who oppose the elimination of reproductive function based on the humanitarian view of "without descendants." However, I believe that whether one is for or against, one will grasp the core of the issue. Because the crux of the problem is not the pros and cons of castration, but the political magic of imperialism in decline, as reflected by this castration trend.</p>
<p>First, among the various imperialist countries, applying root-and-branch castration or partial elimination of reproductive function to people is nothing more than to punish crime and prevent criminals from spreading "bad seeds" and those suffering from serious diseases from breeding "inferior races." The inheritance of diseases and certain inferior traits is indeed a fact, but most of the general crime and serious diseases in today's society are due to the defects of the social system. The system of wage slavery and the "digging one's own grave" economic panic are constantly oppressing people to engage in prostitution or take risks. In other words, the current society is fundamentally a society that manufactures male thieves and female prostitutes, while syphilis and other infectious diseases have become byproducts of "urban civilization." Therefore, human crime or infection with serious diseases can always be bestowed by society, and most of it does not come from the "intimate relations" of their parents. Now, the likes of Hitler and American politicians and jurists deliberately obscure the fundamental crux of the socio-economic structure, specializing in preventing patients or "bad people"</p>
<p>from passing on their genes. This is clearly a case of "seeing a speck in autumn but not seeing a cartload of firewood," a feigned stupidity, a scam!</p>
<p>Second, the bourgeoisie initially avoids medical treatment for their own illnesses, but when the whole body rots and they can no longer hide it, they grab one or two superficial and insignificant sores, making a great show of "treating the illness" in order to deceive the oppressed in society, showing that the group of prime ministers and ministers are still somewhat capable. Hitler and American gentlemen have recently been using the method of eliminating reproductive function to prevent the spread of "diseased seeds" and "bad seeds," while encouraging the breeding of "good seeds." Their actual role in improving the national society is exactly the same as taking a sore, bathing and fasting, and applying a plaster, while the entire rotting syphilis is placed on the "slow lane." This is the fundamental characteristic of the bourgeois medical doctors; they will never prescribe a "fundamental cure" for the "national disease" because once they get involved in treating the root cause, they have to deny themselves first.</p>
<p>Third, now is the eve of world war, and the political giants of the great powers are limited to significant contradictions in thought and action. In order to manufacture a large number of strong cannon fodder, the imperialists are all encouraging reproduction by agreement. But at the same time, they also obscure the fundamental source of the anarchist state of production, thinking that the arrival of economic recession and war crisis is due to "overpopulation." Therefore, everyone imagines that stopping people in the lower and middle classes from passing on their genes can eliminate the scourge of war and lead to "peace." Therefore, the imperialists also want to eliminate the reproductive function of many adults and children. By observing the "Eunuch Tide" and the encouragement of marriage together, we can see that the imperialists, who are trapped in significant contradictions, have now gone from being embarrassed to "digging up what they buried"!</p>
<p>Exposing the magic lantern, the "Eunuch Tide" spreading in Europe and the United States is just one of the new illusions performed by imperialist politicians.</p>
<p>According to doctors at a hospital in Michigan, USA, many children have their reproductive functions eliminated because they have "strong sexual desires" and develop morbid conditions. From the perspective of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application," I would approve of applying this scientific surgery to Chinese warlords and bureaucrats, because if their sexual desires were not so strong, how could they marry so many concubines and choose even more young girls to devour?</p>
<h3>Fleeing and Begging</h3>
<h3>"Preventing" Whose "Consumption"?</h3>
<p>— Xue Fei</p>
<p>Recently, a so-called "Tuberculosis Prevention Association" has been initiated in Shanghai. They say that, based on a population of 100,000, 307 people in China die from tuberculosis each year, six times more than New Zealand, four times more than Egypt and the United States, three and a half times more than Germany, three times more than England, two and a half times more than Spain, twice as much as Italy, and one and a half times as much as France and Japan. Numerically speaking, this is a shocking tuberculosis mortality rate in China. Naturally, tuberculosis prevention is urgently needed in China at this time.</p>
<p>However, whose tuberculosis are we preventing? That is, which part of the Chinese population suffers from tuberculosis the most, and for which part of the population are we preventing tuberculosis? I want to raise this question first. This is a prerequisite question for tuberculosis prevention in China. If this question is not resolved, any tuberculosis prevention movement will probably end up with nothing.</p>
<p>We know that the sources of tuberculosis are: first, overwork; second, malnutrition; and third, unclean air. In particular, poor working conditions are most likely to cause tuberculosis in people with weak constitutions. Then, which part of the Chinese population is most likely to develop tuberculosis? Naturally, the overworked and impoverished common people, the malnourished and impoverished common people, and those who cannot breathe fresh air, especially the impoverished common people! This is especially true in large cities. As a result, the most likely people to develop tuberculosis are naturally the general impoverished common people. Since the general impoverished common people are the most likely to develop tuberculosis, then tuberculosis prevention should, of course, be aimed solely at the general impoverished common people. However, judging from past experience, this is not the case in reality. We often hear about so-and-so high-ranking official going to Mount Lu to recuperate, or so-and-so going to Mount Mogan to rest. And what about the general impoverished common people? Not to mention Mount Lu and Mount Mogan, which are like fairy mountains at sea, they have never even dreamed of them. Even ordinary hospitals charge one yuan for registration, and the most basic third-class ward costs 30 or 40 yuan per month, plus other special expenses, selling both men and women is not enough for half a year. May I ask how the general impoverished common people can prevent disease? How can they treat tuberculosis if they have it? As for the various sanitary facilities in the home and all the comfortable living conditions, these all require money. Especially in Shanghai, to breathe some fresh air, you have to pay to buy it. May I ask if the general impoverished common people can do this? Since tuberculosis prevention and treatment are impossible for the general impoverished common people, then who exactly are the gentlemen of the Tuberculosis Prevention Association preventing tuberculosis for?</p>
<p>The gentlemen of the Tuberculosis Prevention Association should not think that all that is needed for prevention is to formulate several hygiene rules according to academic theory and ask everyone to abide by them, or at most set up a few free tuberculosis hospitals, plus some tuberculosis prevention publicity, calling on everyone to pay attention, and that's it. This will not prevent the occurrence of any tuberculosis in China. No matter how much you talk about hygiene, no matter how many hospitals you set up, most people will be standing outside of hygiene, standing outside of hospitals, unable to receive your "real benefits." Only by thinking fundamentally for the general impoverished common people, who are the largest number of people in China most susceptible to tuberculosis, can tuberculosis prevention have some practical effect, otherwise, it may all be empty talk. However, what methods do the gentlemen in the Tuberculosis Prevention Conference have to think of?</p>
<p>Preventing tuberculosis, preventing whose tuberculosis? How to prevent it? I want to ask this earnestly one last time.</p>

<h3>Dogs and Chinese People Afterwards</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Seeing foreign dogs sitting proudly in cars beside their foreign masters, licking their lips and smacking their tongues, I truly lack the courage to step into those so-called parks which, in reality, are private gardens.</p>
<p>It seems everyone acknowledges that Chinese people lack public morality. The foreign powers spent so much money and energy turning this wasteland-like Shanghai into the prosperous concessions we see today. Chinese people enjoy all the benefits of material civilization without any effort. Therefore, when they are mentally and physically exhausted and wish to restore their brainpower in the beautiful gardens, they don't want the uncivilized Chinese people interfering. It's already too foolish of them to work like oxen and horses for the benefit of the Chinese! Hence, the rule "Dogs and Chinese people not allowed" appeared. We Chinese people should perhaps forgive their good intentions.</p>
<p>However, foreigners ultimately prioritize harmony for business. Before long, we were also strutting in and out of these so-called parks which, in reality, are private gardens. Although it costs a dollar for admission, it is still the cheapest thing in the world. If you calculate 365 days a year, it's only slightly less than one copper coin a day, which is incomparable to our own Chinese-run entertainment venues like the Great World. After receiving such kindness, how should we Chinese people express our gratitude for their hospitality?</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding "Dogs and Chinese people," I suspect it's just by chance that "dogs" are associated with "Chinese people." However, it's still somewhat embarrassing. If an ignorant foreigner who doesn't know the history of Shanghai comes to China for sightseeing, they might mistakenly believe that Chinese people are animals akin to dogs. Where does that leave us? Therefore, removing the rule "Dogs and Chinese people not allowed" would allow us to stroll around confidently after finishing work at foreign companies. It would also raise the status of the yellow race in the international arena. Personally, I don't want to sit idly all day, cooped up in my grand five-courtyard house in my hometown. That's why I came to Shanghai to live in a small "enjoyment" room.</p>
<p>That being said, it seems we Chinese are gradually becoming more assertive. However, our East Asian neighbor, which also occupies a place among the yellow races, is completely undermining our efforts. See the Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 12th:</p>
<p>"Today, a German in a Düsseldorf restaurant insulted a Chinese man, calling him a heretic and a filthy Japanese, leading to a six-month prison sentence by the court. The Chinese man had pleaded for leniency for the defendant, but the court insisted on punishing him as a warning to others, so that Germans would treat foreigners with proper respect."</p>
<p>Although the dispatch specifies "Chinese," the insult includes calling him a filthy "Japanese," indicating a racial misunderstanding. Chinese people would not be insulted in this way. The rule "Dogs and Chinese people" has been abolished. Goethe came to China and found Chinese women "captivating for days." Therefore, Chinese men are not necessarily "heretics" or "filthy." Chinese people have long been fighting for respect. The most obvious evidence is that we can confidently stroll in the so-called parks which, in reality, are private gardens.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the passage "The Chinese man pleaded for leniency for the defendant" further proves that Chinese people are not "heretics" or "filthy." Chinese people are a peaceful people, always turning major issues into minor ones, and minor issues into nothing. The German mistakenly insulted another member of the yellow race. We are known for our tolerance and should "plead for leniency."</p>
<p>However, a dispatch is ultimately just a dispatch. If "a German" identified him as "Chinese" and called him a "heretic" and "filthy," then when I see foreign dogs sitting proudly in cars beside their foreign masters, licking their lips and smacking their tongues, I truly lack the courage to step into those so-called parks which, in reality, are private gardens.</p>

<h3>Where to Begin?</h3>
<p>— Yu Gui</p>
<p>It's said that the first time one calls a girl from the "Quanyufang" in Fuzhouli, whose name hangs under an electric light (neon lights also apply), to a banquet or a high-class hotel, it's called "dǎ yàng" (打樣, "making a sample" or "tryout"), for the "táng chāi" (堂差, "escort"). An escort is just an escort, but to call it "making a sample" is like the hawker's chant when selling spiced beans: "Eat first (don't misunderstand), then pay."</p>
<p>Naturally, a girl with pockmarked skin and narrow eyes is not someone that spending patrons would be interested in. I often hear Shanghainese say that spending money must be satisfying. We don't need to give any more examples. Let's just talk about calling an escort. Generally, young masters -- I'll tentatively consider them young masters -- spend money to call a woman for entertainment, which naturally must be satisfying. Otherwise, wouldn't their virtuous wives at home object to their entertainment?</p>
<p>Therefore, escorts must first "make a sample." Thus, the girls shave off their eyebrows and put on fake ones, their faces are painted yellow (1934-style yellow rouge), their lips are blood red, they're not afraid of catching a cold in the freezing weather, always wearing a thin lined shirt, high-heeled leather shoes, and their bodies are all curves (imitating "body of love"). Dressed like this, they let discerning friends "make a sample."</p>
<p>For new movies being screened in theaters, as long as there is a sensual scene, advertising friends can use flowery language to write advertisements like soul-stirring, bone-melting, and many other death charms, and make zinc plates of inviting thighs that cost six and a half cents per square inch, then place them in a daily advertisement costing two hundred and forty dollars. That group of "making a sample" friends will naturally hold it up with both hands, as if it were their filial son.</p>
<p>Therefore, the full-page local supplements, the colorful advertisements on the walls, and the stale photos in front of the movie theater are all designed for satisfying friends.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to talk about photography studios. They seem to be exclusively equipped for women. Occasionally, a lucky great man or the like can occupy a spot in front of the glass cabinet. We ordinary men are uniquely absent. Although this also grasps the key to satisfaction, it's even less effective than scratching an itch through boots.</p>
<p>There's a humorous joke: A humorist went to a photography studio that was being painted to take a photo. The staff replied:</p>
<p>"Sir, please come tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Are men not allowed to take photos today?"</p>
<p>"No, sir, we're opening tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Opening tomorrow? Where did all the women's photos come from?" The humorist pointed to the glass cabinet and said, "I thought men weren't allowed to take photos today."</p>
<p>Writing this, I still can't think of the most appropriate title. I really don't know where to begin?</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox</p>
<h3>Why is He Being Cold to Me?</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>"I am one of the most avid readers of the Amateur Correspondence section, because it contains answers to many social problems and I have gained a lot of knowledge from it. I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to the editor." I now have a problem that I would like to ask you to help me solve. Let me explain it below:</p>
<p>Two years ago, I met a Mr. X, who had a very good appearance. Soon, romantic feelings developed and we often embraced and kissed, it was truly passionate.</p>
<p>When the January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred, my parents ordered me to take refuge in Hangzhou. We reluctantly separated and have been writing to each other ever since. After the Shanghai Incident ended, we returned to our original places. It was unspeakably loving when we met again after our separation. However, recently, I don't know why, he asked me to return his letters. I was still in the dream of love at the time and gave them back to him. Since then, he has gradually become cold to me. Sometimes when we meet, we just nod to each other and leave. My knowledge is very shallow and I simply don't understand why this is. I really won't understand unless you, sir, explain it to me. I am extremely grateful. Respectfully wishing you good health. Zhang Meichao."</p>
<p>Editor's note: Regarding the issue of love, people often write letters to ask about it, and we also discuss it publicly in the newspaper as much as possible, because this is the main source of trouble and depression for young people. According to our guess about the question asked in Ms. Zhang's letter, it is probably that the other party has found someone else, or that he is dissatisfied with you in some way, which has led to him gradually becoming cold. Outsiders cannot just guess about this kind of thing: the changes in love really have no fixed pattern, but it should not be without reason. However, it is hidden in a person's heart and unknown to outsiders. Since you used to be passionately in love with him, then you might as well honestly ask him "What is the reason?" This would be a more pleasant outcome. In short, love cannot be forced. Since a crack has occurred between you, it would be best if this crack can be repaired. If it cannot be, then I hope you don't delve into it any further.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the esteemed editors: I recently read an article titled "The Election of Great Women" in the Talk section of your newspaper's local supplement, which mentioned that the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) hosted the Women's Voice Magazine's election of great women, etc. This is clearly incorrect. The YWCA only publishes our magazine, the Women's Youth Monthly, and the Women's Voice Magazine is not hosted by the YWCA. The election of great women is even more of a misattribution. We are writing to request that your newspaper make a correction. We would be most grateful. Sincerely, the Women's Youth Monthly Press, January 15th.</p>

<h3>Notes from Prison (10)(1)</h3>
<p>— Wheel</p>
<p>"Allow me to explain my reasons, allow me to explain my reasons! I'm only referring to the fact that it's useless for the illness I have now. Sodium bicarbonate tablets are very useful medicine, and they do have a considerable effect on my stomach!" I didn't dare to say they were completely useless.</p>
<p>"But you clearly said they were ineffective!" He seemed to have released a burst of pent-up anger, changing his tone to a very peaceful one, saying, "You must understand that the prison treats you very well, very generously. Where else is there such a clean prison cell, such good food, daily exercise, and such good facilities in the clinic? It costs □□□ yuan every year, and the average medical expense for each prisoner is □ dollars per month. Where else is there such sufficiency? ... You say we should prepare effective medicines, and aren't all of these effective? To be honest, tiger bone and papaya wine isn't that expensive, and we could prepare it if we could, but we don't dare give it to you because we're afraid you'll get drunk and cause trouble. As for... the so-called improved prison is considered improved to the fullest extent. If you behave well and abide by the law, then we can report to the Ministry of Military Affairs and have you released or have your sentences reduced..."</p>
<p>His head shook as he spoke more and more passionately, as if he wasn't speaking to me alone, and indeed he wasn't speaking to me alone. His subordinates, the section staff and the head guard, were all watching. He could make a prisoner submit obediently after being beaten, and the prisoner would respond "yes" after every sentence he said. Now he saw clearly his position and his own intelligence and ability. He was now in a position of being a role model, and now he truly looked like a leader above all others. It seemed he was telling his subordinates that they should do as he did, that they should do so skillfully -- in case they encountered this in the future.</p>
<p>He couldn't overcome his joy at his own discovery, so he began to smile later on. He cast some triumphant glances at his subordinates.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes... but I'm very distressed that my illness has dragged on for so long without any progress. I'm very afraid for myself," I said.</p>
<p>"If you really want the wine, you can first ask the doctor, and we'll approve it after he approves it. You don't write a report like this!"</p>
<p>"Yes -- but I did get instructions and permission from the doctor to have my family buy it. After it was brought here, I asked the doctor to give it to me, but he said I had to write a report to you, Section Chief, for approval." I was trying hard to restrain myself, restraining all sharp words, because I had been oppressed several times, just because my attitude was too casual. Although I was stepping forward step by step at this time, taking the path of justice, I couldn't clearly state my reasons, and he wouldn't admit his mistake. Therefore, I used a tone of complaint to ask him. I couldn't give up the wine just like that!</p>
<p>"This wine is beneficial to me. I hope the Section Chief can release it! Can release it! Besides, many people have taken it before."</p>
<p>It took courage to raise the suppressed request again. It was very easy to be rejected in this situation.</p>
<p>"What you say makes some sense -- how do you expect us to openly give you this wine! Go, go, go! Go and abide by the law properly." These were his last words.</p>
<p>"Go back, go back!" The head guard Lin pulled my hand, because I was still standing there, wanting to ask for the wine to be released.</p>
<p>"I've learned something else!" I said to my fellow prisoners back in the cell.</p>

<h3>The Film Artist's View of Freedom</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>If we pay attention to the trends in the film industry, we will not ignore the spirit of some film artists fighting for freedom.</p>
<p>First, we should mention the author of "Don Quixote," Pabst.</p>
<p>Since Hitler's iron fist seized control of Germany, and since Hugenberg, the boss of UFA, was promoted to finance minister of the Hitler government, the entire German society has been chaotic, and the German film industry has also become panicked and suspicious. Thus, Pabst was no longer allowed to create works similar to "The Coal Mine," and Pabst lost his creative freedom. At this time, all he could do was the lament of "The Threepenny Opera." However, the demon king Hitler still couldn't tolerate him and eventually drove him out of the country. Thus, in exile, he made "Don Quixote" in France. According to recent news, he has accepted a contract with Warner Bros. in the United States and will be producing "exposing films" in the United States.</p>
<p>Here, we can see that although he was forced to leave the German film industry, he finally left Germany resolutely and did not succumb to violent forces in order to obtain creative freedom.</p>
<p>In addition, we should also mention Marlene Dietrich, the protagonist of "The Blue Angel."</p>
<p>It is well known that Marlene is German. Because she is a world-famous actress, the Hitler government wanted to use her skills and treat her as a lovely "caged bird." At first, Hitler sent trusted representatives to give Dietrich many sweet words, promising her an incredibly high position. However, our Dietrich was not moved by this "honor." Later, a second delegation came. In addition to the above-mentioned methods, they also used violent threats. The representative said: "If you don't go back this time, you will never have the hope of returning. If you don't go back, the National Socialist Party will take retaliatory measures, harming you and your family..." However, Dietrich, as a great artist, did not succumb to the power.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many similar facts like this, but we don't need to give any more examples.</p>
<p>In the above facts, we can get a common basis, which is that they fought for freedom. Of course, no one wants to lose their freedom, and no one wants to be a plaything in the cage of the violent forever, especially every artist. When they cannot freely express their own will, they will be as depressed as they cannot breathe freely. Therefore, film artists must never be spokespersons for oppressors, just as they do not want to be parrots that can learn human language. This means that film artists should maintain their free will. We must insist on what we want to express in our works with the most resolute attitude.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>My Review of "Auspicious Land"</h3>
<p>— Guang Dou</p>
<p>For the sake of advertising appeal, I entered the Carlton Theater with 120,000 points of hope. The "Sold Out" sign hanging high at the ticket office downstairs further heightened my hope for this film.</p>
<p>But what was the result after watching it? Alas! Very disappointed! Under this disappointment, for the sake of protecting domestic films, we can't help but make an impolite critique.</p>
<p>Yes, in the impenetrable hinterland, the idea of ​​divine power and all kinds of superstitious concepts should be broken. "Auspicious Land" was produced in accordance with this meaning. Unfortunately, our director Shao competed in exaggeration and was unable to truthfully depict and correctly instruct, and even interspersed some unrelated things in it.</p>
<p>I grew up in the hinterland with the heaviest superstition, but I have never seen, or even heard of, a superstitionist who would spend a huge amount of money to seek an auspicious place. What's more, Xu Hongye in the film, dressed in a Western suit, looks like a modern young man. He would be so superstitious. Perhaps he is a Western-style superstitious person.</p>
<p>The long-time worshiper of money was actually complained by his wife a few times, and immediately changed his past behavior and handed over all the money he had gained through corruption. This transformation is so peculiar and rapid that it is inevitably too idealistic.</p>
<p>Also, about the matter of "chōng xǐ" (冲喜, warding off bad luck with marriage), I have only heard of men marrying a wife to ward off bad luck, but never of a father's illness being warded off by a son taking a concubine. This point is quite doubtful.</p>
<p>Linhua Village, which has never had a school, when a small school's establishment ceremony was held, some farmers actually sang the Party song, which really made me confused. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>Review of "Auspicious Land"</h3>
<p>— Zhi Qin</p>
<p>China's film industry is really progressing like a rocket. This film, "Auspicious Land," can better grasp the future and herald a loud funeral bell for imported goods. (Omitted)</p>
<p>Here, let me describe a few points: (1) It very realistically depicts the irrational decline of a bourgeoisie, setting off the unreliability of superstition, as well as the one-sided phenomenon of the countryside, and pointing out the greatness of the interests of the masses. This is correct in terms of consciousness.</p>
<p>(2) The clarity of all the dialogues, as well as the clear recording of actions such as acting and striking matches and pouring wine, is the greatest success of all domestic sound films.</p>
<p>(3) The sword dance in the Farewell My Concubine scene, and the scenes where Xiang Gu says goodbye to A Liang when she secretly escapes on the night before Xu Hongye's marriage, the photography and lighting are well done.</p>
<p>(4) Chen Yumei has already given us a great impression in "Vitality" and "Struggle," and in this performance, she has enriched and magnified that impression.</p>
<p>(5) The novel insertion of three Peking operas, and Xiang Gu's temporary excuse to fetch water, as well as the fact that Xu Hongye, who was accompanying Mo Long into battle, suddenly got the news that Xiang Gu had escaped, which made Feng Jie anxiously look for someone to chase, were all unique clever points of the director.</p>
<p>Finally, let me write a few other thoughts:</p>
<p>(1) There are several whispers in the scenes. It would be best to speak louder so that the audience can easily understand what they are saying.</p>
<p>(2) Some of the dialogues are not very natural. For example, when Xiang Gu stared at A Liang as he left, her mother said, "Carry this load of melons back to the house," which is better than saying, "What are you looking at! Carry the melons back to the house," which fits the situation at the time.</p>
<p>(3) In the lectures and opera scenes, the recording is a bit shaky.</p>
<p>(4) The description says that "students and guests gathered together on the opening day of the rural elementary school," but there were no students on the screen, and there were no children's voices in the singing.</p>
<p>(5) The villagers, who couldn't stand properly, were able to sing the Party song "Three Principles! of the People!..." very neatly, which is a bit bizarre.</p>
<p>Lilian Harvey stars in "The Phoenix Seeks Its Mate," her only masterpiece since she went to the United States. It opens today at the New Light Theater.</p>
<h3>My View of "Auspicious Land"</h3>
<p>— Ren Wei</p>
<p>In "Auspicious Land," we can find three different themes: the first is to break superstitious ideas; the second is to criticize the bad habits of the old marriage system; and the third is to advocate rural water conservancy and education. With the above three points, there is no doubt that the content and consciousness of "Auspicious Land" are very rich and worth seeing.</p>
<p>The director clearly has significant progress here, and everywhere you can see his mastery of skills and many clever little places. For example, the insertion of three Peking operas is very appropriate. If played according to the old opera's format, these three plays would take at least three or four hours to perform; but the director was able to select the most exciting segments, such as Yu Ji's sword dance, Emperor Zhengde's teasing of Li Fengjie, etc.; although it is still a bit too long, (in my opinion, two operas are enough; Huai Du Guan seems to be able to be omitted,) but it doesn't feel very boring.</p>
<p>"Auspicious Land" is a sound film, so we should pay considerable attention to the pronunciation. Although the pronunciation here is not as clear and pleasant as that advertised by Tianyi, such achievements in the current domestic films are indeed worthy of praise.</p>
<p>The actor Tian Fang is a bit stilted; Zhang Zhenduo and Ma Dongwu performed very seriously, but there was nothing amazing; Chen Yumei and Ye Qiuxin performed very delicately and vividly. Ye Qiuxin didn't have many performance opportunities, almost only in the "Touring Dragon and Playing Phoenix" segment, like a昙花一现 (tán huā yī xiàn, ephemerals), but the impression she gave me was very good.</p>
<h3>Sky One Jottings</h3>
<p>— Rhino</p>
<p>After Wang Yuanlong joined Sky One, he starred in two films. One was "Youthful Hot Blood," directed by Tang Jie. The female lead was the model beauty Ye Qiuxin. The other was "Modern Lin Chong," directed by himself. The female lead, known for her robust grace, was Fan Xuepeng. "Youthful Hot Blood" is about to be released, and "Modern Lin Chong" is also nearing completion.</p>
<p>"A Female Star" has been in production for half a year. It has now been edited and will soon be sent to Beijing for review. The film depicts scenes from a sound film studio, making it quite realistic. Because Sky One specializes in producing sound films, the local scenery is naturally particularly lifelike.</p>
<p>"Fleeting Years," directed by Gao Lihen, starring Hu Shan, Ye Qiuxin, Yu Guang, and Lu Jianfen, is adapted from Zhang Henshui's novel. In the film, Hu Shan's scene of washing her feet and singing in the mountains and rivers is intended to be accompanied by a beautiful song. Gao Tianqi has already composed the song "Fleeting Years," but because the melody of the song is sad and not in harmony with the mood of the scene, Mr. Gao has decided to revise it.</p>
<p>"Fruit Shi Shi" is directed by and stars Wang Cilong. The female lead, Fruit Shi Shi, is played by Lu Lixia. Now, people in the company have made "Fruit Shi Shi" Lu Lixia's nickname, and when they see her, they all call her "Fruit Shi Shi."</p>
<p>Sky One has adopted three of Zhang Henshui's novels as film subjects. Besides "Fleeting Years," which has already been filmed, and "Peace Flowers," which is still being scripted, the script for "Happy Rivals" has been completed by director Qiu Baxiang. The main roles have also been decided, with Chen Yumei, Hu Shan, Yu Guang, and others taking on the roles, and filming will begin soon.</p>
<p>Since Xue Juexian and Tang Xueqing starred in "Platinum Dragon," they have not had any new works released. Recently, they will star in "A History of the Cantonese Opera Stage," directed by Shao Zuiweng. The story tells the love history of a Cantonese opera artist. The entire play uses Mandarin dialogue, which is quite different from "Platinum Dragon."</p>
<p>After Wen Yimin and Fan Xuepeng, husband and wife, joined Sky One, Fan Xuepeng's first starring film was "Modern Lin Chong." Wen Yimin's first film as a director is "Dancing Palace Spring Dream," starring Li Minghui and Li Ying, and it is currently being shot scene by scene and will soon be ready for filming.</p>
<p>Sky One will also adapt the world-famous "In Dream Lake" into a script, which is being co-written by Cao Xuesong and Tang Xiaodan. Hong Shen is also writing a script for "Metropolitan Scenery" in preparation for filming during the winter vacation. (Quick Reward)</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>The Cat and the Fiddle (8)</h3>
<p>— Mo Chen</p>
<p>That afternoon, after everyone left, Dodd stayed behind alone. Taking this opportunity, he walked up to Shirley, took her hand, and said, "My dear, you know I've loved you for so long... and it's so sincere. Will you marry me?" "Yes," Shirley's voice seemed to come from another world, "Yes, I'm very willing to marry you." Surprisingly, the news spread quickly. One day, Victor was rehearsing the operetta when he heard the news. He felt as if the sky was falling around him. His success was already in sight, but it was too late to save the situation. Shirley, he had never forgotten her for a moment, but she had forgotten him! Shirley couldn't wait a few more days and was going to marry Dodd right away. His mouth was shut, and his teeth were clenched. He remembered Dodd's cunning, maneuvering him away to give himself a chance to get close. He knew he had been tricked by Dodd, but maybe it wasn't too late... If his operetta could succeed a few days earlier, perhaps he could still win the final victory.</p>
<p>Odette watched Victor with great interest. For months, she had developed a secret affection for Victor, hoping that one day he would fall in love with her. She often teased him with words, but he always remained cold and indifferent. She guessed that he hadn't forgotten Shirley. But now that Shirley was about to marry Dodd, perhaps she could find a way to make him change his mind. Later, she was alone in the dressing room, and she invited Victor in and openly declared her love for him. This made Victor panic and feel at a loss. Finally, he said, "I admire you very much, but I don't have any love for you." Odette's jumping heart couldn't help but feel restrained. She said, "What are you afraid of! Are you afraid of my husband? Darling, you don't have to be afraid of him. In any case, he won't know." Victor said, "But I don't love you. I love Shirley, and I will never forget her. Odette..."</p>
<p>Like a sentimental mood, she wrapped her arms around Victor's neck and said softly, "My poor, silly child, let me make you forget her. My darling, you make me love you to death."</p>
<p>The door slowly opened, and Victor was the first to see that the person who came in was none other than Odette's husband. He looked truly pitiful and heartbroken. Victor quickly explained, "We're rehearsing." Odette's husband glared at Odette and said, "I never agreed to you going back on stage. I should have forbidden you long ago." Odette rushed to her husband and wrapped her arms around his neck, saying, "But, I love, you're being too unreasonable." The old man said angrily, "Of course, it's mostly unreasonable for an old man and a young woman to be in love." Then he turned to look at Victor, and it was their first time meeting. He said resentfully, "You are very young. I am old. But I can't give up my wife easily. My only way is to not let her go on stage again." He then turned back to Odette and said, "Please decide for yourself. Do you still want to go on stage? Or do you want a husband like me?" (To be continued)</p>
