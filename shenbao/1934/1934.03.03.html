<p>史家論歐洲之文明每謂希臘之後繼其業者爲羅馬羅馬之後繼其業者則爲日耳曼人我人披覽西洋歷史而益信焉蓋希臘衰時亡於羅馬其文化亦爲羅馬所繼承羅馬衰時亡於日耳曼人並其所建之帝國名號亦爲所襲所謂神聖羅馬帝國實非羅馬人之帝國而爲日耳曼人之帝國也其後扼匈奴於奥地利拒突厥於多瑙河下游塞蒙古西進之途亦皆由日耳曼人所造成故其保持西歐文明之功獨多觀於今日德境以外歐陸各地尚有千八百萬日耳曼人之存在卽可想見當時日耳曼人四出征討之盛况矣故自歷史言日耳曼人實爲歐洲英名夙著之一大民族至拿破倫蹂躪德境日耳曼之民族精神又爲唤起經半世紀之醖釀遂於普魯士領導之下結合各邦造成大戰前之帝國德人稱此帝國爲第二帝國蓋所以别於往昔之神聖羅馬帝國也此一帝國之威武炫赫至今猶使德人爲之興奮希脫拉乘之遂以創建第三帝國相號召意謂欲使日耳曼民族恢復過去之光榮開創將來之動業必先結合散處各地之日耳曼民族以成一大集團其抱負之大至堪驚人證諸日耳曼民族過去之歷史不能謂爲全然架空之奢望也</p>

<p>美提訂世界不侵犯公約</p>
<p>軍備不得用以侵略鄰國</p>
<p>已有九國被邀參加會議</p>
<p>（倫敦）英政府現定於本月底在倫郭召集特别軍縮會議據消息靈通各界稱、此次會議將爲歷年來軍縮會議之最重要者、美國將提出全世界締結不侵犯條約之驚人建議、比爲羅斯福總统之計畫、聞除限制或取消攻勢武器外、且須擔保所餘之軍備亦不能用作侵略鄰國之用、被邀參與此特會者、爲美·法·意·德·俄·日·波蘭·比利時·西班牙九國、小恊約國（即羅馬尼亞·捷克·南斯拉夫·）亦將被邀、據西門與漢德森之意見、如艾登之報告書能受衆歡迎、則此特會至少能以英意之備忘錄爲根據商得妥洽云、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦消息靈通各界不承認英國對於軍縮現作最後努力之說、但非政界則覺訂成軍縮公約之機會、將視掌璽大臣艾登之報告是否可受人贊同爲决、艾登比次曾至巴黎·羅馬·柏林·解釋英國軍縮備忘錄、並謀成一軍縮公約之骨幹、今晚已由歐陸回至倫敦、艾登抵時、路透代表曾往謁見、艾登謂此行殊屬有益、已袪除某種困難與誤會、兩政府（德意）對英國軍縮備忘錄之意見、已切實明瞭、渠信第三政府（法）之意見不久亦可知曉、於是渠此行之使命乃告完成、且此次得與歐洲主要政治家相接晤、其爲益殊匪淺鮮云、</p>

<p>美國對艾登報告書之態度殊關重要、而羅斯福總統之特使台維斯適於今夜行抵倫敦、此事甚可注意、台维斯將與艾登會晤、討論一切、</p>
<p>艾登今日離巴黎返國前、曾與法總理杜邁格及法外長巴爾都會商數小時、散會時、巴爾都頗欽佩艾登之才能、謂艾具有興奮而卓越之意志此種不落邊際之言、毫不能消除巴黎所抱公約前途未因艾登此行而大放光明之悲觀、</p>
<p>艾登離法外交部後、法當局卽發表公報、謂艾登曾以在柏林與羅馬之談話報告杜邁格與巴爾都、且就此項情報解釋英國備忘錄之原則、杜巴於是乃告艾登、彼等將繼續研究、日内將以法政府之决議通知之云、</p>

<p>申報無線電週刊　熱絲交連安培表的簡易製造及復活法  明襄　　測量射電週率電流，不可用普通的商用週率交流電流表，需以一種特製的，稱爲熱絲交連安培表（Thermo　coupelAmmeter），如發報機測量天線電流的，卽是此類，但價值很貴，業餘研究者不易置備，且這種電表僅能容受Ｉ００／０的過量負載，所以熱絲交連安培表的燒毁，是無線電實騐者極易遇到的事情，如付之廠家修理，大約要收電表原價一半的修理費，否則祇有棄之，永久成爲廢物。　　假設我們遇到燒毁的熱絲交連安培表，或是已有了普通的直流電流表，想改成熱絲交連式，以測量射電週率電流，可以照下述的簡易方法，不費一文，便可達到復活或新製的目的了。　　找一個已損壞無用的２０１Ａ式眞空缐ＢＣ鎳玻璃幹銅線ＡＤ管，他種四脚眞空管亦可，除去其外面的玻璃罩，裏面封固各極引綫的玻璃幹，須完好並與膠底緊固，所有屏極珊極絲極的物質，一併拆去，但須在玻璃幹上面，各留出約一時長相等的支持絲ＡＢＣＤ，此四支持線的頂端，排佈成半英吋的四方形，另以鎳（Ｎlckel）或Nlchrome製成的導線，卽以先前拆下的栅極線亦可，彎成Ｖ形，銲接在四方形相隣兩支持缐的頂端，如ＢＣ，使Ｖ的尖端，適在四方形的中心，再以一根銅線，長度與鎳線相等，亦彎成Ｖ形，套入鎳綫的Ｖ形中，兩Ｖ形的尖端，互相鈎住，並須拉緊，然後銲接在其他兩支持線的頂端ＡＤ，這樣，熱絲交連器，已告完成，參閱附圖，極易明瞭。　　設有高週率電流，自此交連器四方形的兩相對角流過，則其他兩相對角間，卽有直流電壓産生，如以ＡＣ兩端，接在高週率電路内，而以ＤＢ兩端，連接直流電流表，或已燒毁的熱絲交電流表内，接住細彈簧的兩引線，表上卽有指數，指示高週率電流的强弱。　　此新製的交連器，須與標凖的熱絲交連安培表，較配凖確，較配時的電流亦需高週率的，否則，當有錯誤，最好多做幾個大小粗細物質不同的交連器，以求獲得大小不同的電流範圍。收音機内之變壓器  高崇齡　　收音機内變壓器，因各級高低週率不同的原故，故各級的變壓器構造不同，因有下列四種的區别　　（一）高週率變壓器此種變壓器用在高週率放大級内，通常多用空心式，有時鋼心式也用之。圖四與圖五爲空心式的兩種造法，圖一爲鋼心式，空心式對於高週率放大最佳，但高週率的配諧範圍（ＴunedRange）狹小，鋼心式對於高週率的配諧範圍較闊。通常除極長波外高週率變壓器的兩個線圈數比都爲一比一，换句話說，卽初級線圈數等於次級線圈線。圖一圖二圖三圖四屏栅　　（二）中間週率變壓器這種變壓器適於中間週率放大用，無極外差式的收音機多月這種的變壓器。空心式，或鐵心式，均可適用。簡便的製法，可用四分三寸徑半寸長之木筒一個，圍以二十六號銅線二五零圈，是爲初級線圈，線圈外護以臘纸，再以三十六號次級綫圈一五零零圈圍；繞之卽成。　　（三）低週率變器低週率變壓器通常都用鐵心式，次級綫圈數與初級綫圈數之比最小爲二１／２，最大的超過一零，尋常次級綫圈多爲初级之三倍半，或三倍。變壓比例不能過大。過大則易引起失眞而擾亂收音，且雜聲及天電擾亂均能隨收音放大而增大，亦爲限制變壓比之一因。放大级内欲使放大輸出電力，或電壓爲最大，必須使眞空管所負之荷阻（LoadＲesistance與眞空管之内阻）（nternalＲesistance）之比適爲２Ｎ（Ｚ爲壓比）；爲欲適此需要，故變壓器之變壓比有限制。中間週率變壓器及低週率變壓器用於放大级内均爲升高變壓，但低週率變壓器用於喇叭之前時則應爲降低變壓器，以使流於喇叭之電流增大故也。　　（四）電源變壓器電源變壓器於交流收音機内爲一不可缺乏的機件？因爲電燈廠所發的五十週或六十週之交流電多爲ＩＩＯ或２２０伏，欲使此電壓應用眞空管之屏極或絲極，必須藉電力變壓器以升高或降低，此種變壓器爲鐵心式與鐵殻式，其次級必須裝設許多接頭以適應屏極○○至４５０高壓之用及絲極２至６伏低壓之用。上述各種變壓器之製造。因限於篇幅，從略。　　不精密的修理等於不修理　　因爲現在的毛病雖修好　　將來的毛病已經種下根了　　收音機出毛病最好送到大上海無線電機公司　　南京路四十九號四川路口中央大厦一　　樓Ａ字四號　　電話一四九九六　　本公司備有免費修理劵奉送，凡有收音機者，　　請至本公司簽名索取，存劵無多，欲索從速。中雍無缐電機之新貢獻　　膠木可變電阻第二三○號　　專供直流電燈絲電壓之用　　３０及１５歐姆二種定價每只洋八角　　準確堅固耐用價格低廉爲國産界中罕見之出品　　本廠前向美國ＫenＲad眞空管廠定到大批３０省電眞空管現已到滬並此附告　　中雍營業部寗波路五九八號（新光大戲院隔壁）電話九五三四二號　　成績優異的兩　　管來復式交流收音機  褀　　因爲各方面都受了經濟的限止，於是對於這頗耗錢的玩意—無綫電收音機—總格外的打算，以期减輕負擔。兩月前，作者將一具經常支出浩大的二燈直流機，改成二燈交流。（另一磴整流）最近又因爲音量不满意，所以想改成三管交流，然限於電源，未能實現，而反把牠改成了來復式的。不道裝成後，成績竟出乎意料。其選擇性及音量，均堪與具有一級２０１低放的三管機相匹敵。所以敢負責介紹給初試的讀者。茲將綫路繪之於後。　　ＬＬＩ均繞於蛛網板上，Ｌ用２４號紗包綫繞五十四圈，每九圈分一頭，各銲接於分綫器上。Ｌ１約繞四十圈左右，用同號綫。二綫板共裝於推拉架上。Ｌ２Ｌ３各爲七十圈之蜂房綫圈，然亦可繞於蛛網板上。礦石以化合炭者爲佳，如普通者亦須固定式，以免麻煩。ＡＦＣ用三十亨利二十五　安倍已足，亦可以低週波變壓器代之。眞空管用一２７及一０１，若以新式５６代一２７則更佳。其他各件，均詳註圖上。恕不贅述。　　電源變壓器鐵心，可用一寸見方的斷面積。初級２２０Ｖ，用三十三號漆包綫繞二千三百十圈。次級高壓，三十八號綫繞一千零五十圈。低壓供給者，用十六號綫繞二十八圈，十四圈處引一中心分綫。供給整流管一０１者，用二十四號綫繞五十六圈，二十八圈處亦引一中心分綫。如進綫爲１１０Ｖ，則需另行設計。　　此機收本埠可用揚聲器放音。如用一根良好之地綫，天綫約十餘尺，則可完全解决上海收音之困難。至於中央，日本等處，皆能收聽满意也，内外消息　　天耳無綫電公司。開設仁記路三十五號，電話一八四三六號，自開設迄今，營業蒸蒸日上，蓋工作精良，價格低廉有以致之也。查該公司自修理部添用修理技師以來，確能迅速交貨，而於工作上，仍無絲毫苟且，茲爲應社會人仕之所需要，且訂定優待顧主辦法。凡收音機損壞後。直接送往該公司修理，能於四十八小時内修竣，完好如新，並擔保使用云云。　　信記廠近訊—本埠西門方斜路三七一弄信記廠，爲一年來後來居上的無綫電機廠，該廠初次出品固定電容器，已受業餘界之歡迎，近該廠爲精益求精計，第二次决近製造一ＭＦＤ以上之電容器。以期研究者之便利云　　大上海無綫電機公司，新近遷至南京路四十九號，中央大厦一樓Ａ字四號，電話一四九九六號，該公司對於修理無綫電收音機，十分可靠，向爲各界稱許。現爲酬謝歷年顧客起見，備有免費修理劵奉送，凡有收音機者，以備損壞時免費修理，請速至該公司簽名素取，遲恐不及云。　　李元慶。魏心蘇，石華玉，ＲＦ，朱紫源，一知，高崇齡，明襄，程範羣，至孟澂，ＫＭＫ諸君鑒，二月份稿費請於本月六日至十日，十六日至二十日下午一時至四時憑來稿所蓋圖章蒞本館會計處支收爲盼。　　申報無綫電週刋部啓</p>

<p>春秋舞弊  花鈴　　舞弊一，外人看來，是爲我們這個『劣等』『半開化』的民族獨有的民族性，因爲在歐美的雜誌及小說裏，時常可以拜讀到寫在外國及太家裏當差的『僕歐』，如何如何的舞弊，怎麽怎麽打後手，活龍活現．說得入木三分的大作．自然，拜讀了如此這般，若有其事．而且還該是『依此類推』的大作，就是我們這些『劣等民族』中的半開化式的人民，雖然要不服氣，而想申辯幾句，可也就反而要被優等民族　爲『惡大狂吠』了吧，因爲『舞弊』這一回子事，是半開化的劣等民族幹的買賣已成定讞的了．　　但是，在不久以前，在西半球上，似乎發生過某銀團的一件大舞弊案．據調查所得，那時的幾位現任的大官大府之間，以及許多卸任中大官大府，都與這一件大舞弊案，發生了不可思議的關係．接着，在歐洲的某國，也玩了一次公債大舞弊案，吵得家翻宅亂，雞犬不寗，在首都大演其巷戰，眞刀眞槍，險些兒閙出革命的把戲來．這一幕戲才唱完，西方優等民族所公認爲東半球上，最是出色當行，頗有資格與列强稱兄道弟的某國，也不甘落人後，富有模倣精神的來一回某相的大舞弊，你檢舉我，我彈劾你，閙得落花流水，不亦樂手．　　怪．從前是歐風東漸，可是如今怕的有些兒『中風西漸』了吧，否則『半開化民族所獨有的』『舞弊劣根性』，怎地會得風行一時於優等民族之間呢？但是話還說回來，『舞弊一這一套，須由大亨玩，才不失其爲大國的風度．若僅由少數外國太太家裏的『僕歐』，在那裏舞弊，打後手，那依然是一種劣根性的表現．　同是一個『舞弊』，其間還有『優』『劣』的分别！抝春冷  吟秋　　冬盡春回，天氣本已漸漸的温暖了，可是没有這般便宜，一定還要作冷，譬如做文章．造物善用曲筆，便是所謂『抝春冷』．嚴冬的冷，是順的．漸漸的加劇，所以憑你朔風大雪，都覺得容易抵抗，可是『抝春冷』，却反覺得怪難受的．脚冷手冷，最爲顯著，因爲春天皮膚，都已鬆弛，没有冬天那般緊張，所以往往有冬天不生凍瘃，到了春天，反易發生，致成春瘃的，很是不少　　冷是人人怕的，不僅是『天氣的冷』，便是『人情的冷』，也是很難領受的．譬如冷言一譏諷，『冷眼』旁觀，『討冷債面孔』，『冷板橙生涯』，都是世間常有的事．其他笑有『冷笑』，待有『冷待』，親戚之間，有『冷水親家母』；社會之中，有『冷血性動物』；弄到『熱氣换冷氣』，］還像什麽人生？還成什麽世界？　　話又要說回來了！冷也非全無可取的，冷也有很好的意義．所以蘇州虎邱有『冷香閣』，可以賞梅；杭州靈隐有『冷泉亭』，可以納凉．人的姓名，如『冷禦秋』，『陶冷月』，『吳江冷』，是人都知道的．書名則有惠洪的『冷齋夜話』，陸以　的『冷廬雜識』，曹昌麟的『冷巢集』鄭叔問的『冷紅詞』．詩句有崔之『楓落吳江冷』，王之『日色冷青松』，樂天之冷巷閉門無客到』，君復之『冷淡門庭樹石中』，均屬佳句．他如館有『冷館』，攤有『冷攤』，箋有『冷金箋』，都是『冷趣』幽默，『冷味』深長，反覺雅雋高逸的了．所以我說；要有『冷淡的頭腦』，熱沸的心腸；處得慣『冷靜的環境』，做得出熱烈的事業；那怕他荒漠寒江，氷天雪窖，都可去得，不要說什麽『抝春冷』了希望  周沁　　有人問我『你希望些什麽？』我說『一些希望都没有．因』爲如果我要希望的，希望些什麽好呢？　　中國人的父母送子女進學校，唯一的希望是將來兒子做大官，女兒也可嫁給大官，因此中國呢？大學生到處皆是，而大官過剩．　　記得西班牙的詩人歐利潘．有一首詩道；『希望』！希望點什麽＿是青春　因爲青春消逝．希望也逃遁了！　　『希望』，進一步就是『實現』．『實現』就可满足人的一生．但是我們只有充分的『希望』，没有满足的『實現』啊！談龜  鄭逸梅　　中國保龜動物會同人，有見於徐家匯一帶的小船，專以捕殺龜類爲業，宰殺之時．異常慘酷；因此特函請市公安局出示，飭屬嚴禁殺龜，這確是一椿善舉，值得人們注意的。　　龜爲爬蟲，腹背部有甲，甲的表面遮以表皮變成的紋片，所以俗有十三塊的稱謂，壽命可延長到百歲以外，古時把牠來占卜吉兇，和麟鳳龍，其、共號四靈，所以往往取龜爲名字，如什麽陳龜咧，祝龜咧，陸龜蒙咧，李龜年咧，楊龜山咧，余崇龜咧都是，近來世風漓薄，把龜爲取笑之資。因此人們都有諱龜之癖，獨洹上袁寒雲，却别署龜　，自然矯異。　　相傅唐時樂户，皆着綠頭巾，人因龜的頭爲綠色，便把着綠頭巾的呼爲龜樂户妻女盡歌伎，故又名開設伎院縱妻女賣淫的爲龜，輟耕錄載嘲廢家子孫詩；宅眷皆爲撑目兎，舍人總作縮頭龜，那麽可知元時已用爲訕駡之語了，有人說；烏龜諧音汚閨，把烏龜來]駡人，就是指人家帷薄不修，也很有理。　　龜有背上積苔，綠色湛然的，呌做綠毛龜，人家蓄諸瓷盎，以爲清玩，據說病衂的，撮少許綠毛塞鼻管。衂自痊愈，很有效的。　　九尾龜爲書名，出於漱六山房張春帆氏手筆，描寫海上的花事，用婉轉溜亮的蘇白，尤爲動人，在稗苑中是頗有地位的　　龜是古時的貨幣，易經；或錫之十朋之龜，漢王莽更作有元龜，公龜，侯龜，子龜等名目。　　龜殻可以製冠，稱爲龜屋，陸放翁詩；龜屋新裁二寸冠。　　龜脫殻，體能發展變爲極毒之物，稱爲化血丹，更名忽立，在旱地的尤毒，嘘氣卽能殺人。水滸傅朱貴渾名旱地忽立，便指脫殻龜而言，所以殺龜去殻，異常危險，偶一脫逃，便釀巨禍。　　吳中風俗，廢歷四月十四日，輒至閶門内神仙廟燒香，廟的左右，一般窶户，竸賣一種絶小的烏龜。燒香和游廟的，都要買一二個回去，稱爲神仙龜。　　龜多别名，如異苑；野人呼龜爲元緒公，毛勝水族如恩令；元介卿，爾卜灼之效，宜授通幽博士，孫惠賦；有緇衣之大夫兮，衣元繡之衣裳。東北四連長  張恨水　　第二十五回　　涙臉送人辭家歸遠成　風沙澈夜出塞駐孤城　　不料在這樣臨别依依，正想借題來忘掉一切的時候，偏是這位老實過了分的人，却把這個謎揭破了，桂枝心裏，猛可的受着了强烈的襲擊，也是呆住了。小林把這個困難問題，悶在肚子裏，有十幾個鐘頭了，只是無機會可說，所以悶到於今。現在和自强有了接近的機會，而且要不問出來就錯過了，所以不顧一切，就衝口而出。不料說出來之後，把人家夫妻兩口子，都閙得觸了電一樣，這呌他也嚇了一跳，難道這話是問不得的？只在這時，遙遙的發生了汽車機輪播動聲，接着那輛送人的長途汽車，就開到了面前來停住。小林忙着將提箱提包送了上車，隨後自强手扶着車門，也跳了上去。桂枝只靠近了身邊，攙住他一把，什麽話也來不及說，自强已經鑽進車子裏面去了。桂枝趕快跑到車窗子下站住，自强就兩手扶了玻璃，臉也緊緊貼住。桂枝抬起手來，將小手绢向他招着，眼涙已是由兩個眼眶子滾下兩粒來。然而他可嘻嘻的笑着道··路上保重呵呵！家裏的事你是不必掛心的。我是···自强不曾把的話聽完，車子已是呼突突的開走了。他是怎麽樣？他是快樂的，他是苦惱的？他是等着我來接他的？他是自已很能自處的？這些未來的事情，只爲没有把他所說的聽完，現時都在不可知之列。可是腦盘裏留下了他一個影子，眼涙是要向下落着的了，然而他那雪白的牙齒，微微向外露着幾粒，正在笑着呢。可憐他環境，從此就要陷入到那啼笑皆非的狀態裏面去，　我要安慰他，只有早早的把他接了出去一個法子了。（三二六）關於提銀價問題  張英超作提高銀價　　呐喊的福斯羅　　一每了覺　　塊露的着動搖　　外貨　　　銷會引起工商界的恐慌　　一週來之最新說話題林　　成　友封之給紜　　投機者之活躍　　外貨　位傾銷也是樂用　　者的福音　標金</p>

<p>自由談	文學和『天空』『暗夜』  野容　　　『社會的地生活着的人們，也是不中止其在自然中的生活的。無疑，他們並不像獸類一樣地和自然緊緊着的，因爲他們是生活在人工的地域上的　０··』—ＡntoniLabriola　　文學的發生，有人主張是出自人類的勞働，也有人說不是。但無論怎樣，文學是人類有组織的社會生活底反映，却無可疑惑。倘說文學是『幻想』，那麽來决定這幻想的當是社會组織，生活形態。和『晴朗而遼闊的天空』一幽森深鬰的暗夜』，是截然無關的。這就是說地理環境，自然影響，對文學的作用，並不重大。　　古明先生在本刋發表了一篇『南北文學及其他』大意是論南方與北方文學的消長，無非是由於自然環境的變遷，北方現在地瘠民貧，而南方却物産豐饒文學是要在物産豐饒，山明水秀的地方纔會發達的。所以現在南方人物較北方爲多。　　他還舉了例，說，『我們從來不聞新疆有偉大的文學，西藏出了世界聞名的作家。普通民間歌謠，許有文學價值，然未必能比上荷馬。』因此他很驚嘆『自然勢力之偉大。』　　其實是不必那麽驚奇的。荷馬不生於西藏與不生於現代的希臘一樣，和自然環境毫無關係，倘說『晴朗而遼闊的天空和幽森深鬰的暗夜』是『宗敎和文學的淵源　，那麽現代的希臘天空，和古昔並無不同，爲什麽不再生一個荷馬？那麽南北文學的消長，是什麽緣故呢？我想這答覆不是地理或自然環境有了什麽變遷，北方文學的衰落。倘說是地方使用已盡，文化因而枯竭，那麽北方的北方，有一個比牠更寒苦的地帶，從前産生普希金，戈郭里，現在産生了高爾基。南方的興起。倘說是物産豐饒，然而這豐饒雖出自地上，却由人力，况且土地也就是自古相傅，爲什麽從前斷髮文身，而現在忽然文明起來呢？至於『文化南移』，『歐風東漸』更是人爲的，和自然環境無關。　　倘說北方人民使用地力，不加培養，就正是人爲的缺陷。四川的炎井用完了，不是還有煤汽，電汽麽？倘使是文明的，岩石上也以栽培花木。文化的進步與否是看人力，不關自然。因爲人類的文明史是征服自然的歷史。　　南北文化的消長，有一個顯明的事實，是政治中心南遷。政治中心爲什麽南遷？是因爲南方與北方社會前進的速率不同，北方還在封建的老爺大人牢固的统治下，而地方却已在中外闊人，買辦，流氓的手中。與南方和北方的『風水』是無關係的。他們的文化  黑嬰　　眞慚愧，自家是生長在馬來國土里的一個人，逢到中國的朋支問到他們的文化情形，我常常一句話都回答不出來。我所能滔滔叙述的祇是那里的風景，那里的奇異的菓子，進一步要我說出華僑居住在那里的略况就很爲難了；我總是—很悽慘！很受壓迫—　　那麽攏統的回着話。—怎樣的悽慘呢？　　問的人儘是迫逼着。我的臉有點發燒，我後悔在馬來國土里的時候爲什麽不留心視察一下？眞是小孩子呵！可是没有人原諒我這一點。他們不知道我在那里的時候從未接觸過社會，像怪我吝惜着這一些材料不願告訴他們似的瞪着眼珠子。——自然很悽慘，現在到處都閙不景氣，華僑在那里不是做生意就做工；你知道這時候生意多難做—還有殖民地政府偏偏在人家閙窮的時候加倍的抽着稅，你說死不死？做工的人更糟，什麽工廠，什麽橡膠園不關閉就裁員，大半都失了工作；他們的家又離得那麽遠，連『老米』都吃不成。這情形，你想想—　　不曉得那里來的勇氣，一長串地說了那麽許多。然而這究竟是一般的現象，記載在報纸上的就不少；他們還不满足，還要問；—馬來人有没有文化？—文化？什麽文化？　　其實我這句話是故意說出來的。—文化都不懂得？　　聲音露着不相信的樣子。就在這時候一禮拜要上三個鐘頭『西洋文化史』的課，我怎麽能够說『文化』兩個字都不懂呢可是，我不知道怎麽說才好。—馬來人不是猩猩。也不是怎樣野蠻的民族；文化，我想總應該有的吧？　　這是問的那個朋友說的。　　我到底使朋友們失望了，等了那麽多時候我還是低着腦袋一聲不響。於是他們走了；也許心里在譏笑我的不懂文化，也許在懐疑我只此一點點見聞都吝惜地保藏起來。我有什麽話說呢？不懂的事我不能揑造出來满足朋支的慾望；我還年輕，說謊這回事我覺得是不應該的。然而我自慚；來自馬來國土的人爲什麽不能說出馬來人的文化呢？　　我能够寫這里的是；馬來人不會有二十二層的摩天建築；但是他們是信奉回敎的，　立在炎熱的太陽下的敎堂和相隔不遠的『馬來王』的家却是另有一種藝術意味的。他們也有文字。可惜那種歪歪曲曲的亞拉伯文我一個也不認得；我所能看的馬來文是用羅馬字拚音的，也卽是現在所通行的。馬來人的子弟讀馬來文的自然很多，可是却以入英文學校爲更光榮似的。他們也有電影，而且進步到發聲的Ｔalkie了；有趣的是他們也攝製『仙伯英台』—流行於中國南方的故事，可見中國人在馬來國土里是如何給馬來人以甚深的影響。一般的大衆住的都是茅草搭起來的屋子，呌做『亞搭厝』。至於婚嫁列儀這一些，他們也有很多可記地方，不過我想不再寫下去了。　　末尾，告訴大家；我們的孫中山先生的『三民主義』也有馬來文的譯本，那是兩年前出版的。有許多馬來人都懂得；—逹克透孫逸仙是創造中華民國的絮語  瑕厂（一）周文煒說；『今人無事不蘇矣。東西相向而坐，名曰蘇坐。主尊客上。客固辭者再，久之曰求蘇坐。此語大可蚩，三十年前無是也。坐而蘇矣，語言舉動，安得不蘇。』在這裏，所謂『蘇』，實際上是代表了『雅』，東坡　一　心目中，大概是『典型的雅人』。不知東坡的存在，果眞是建築在這些『雅』的行動上嗎？是眞所謂『去其精華』，『取其糟粕』矣。今人作事，何嘗不是如此。（二）　　其實世間究竟有幾個『雅人』，『閒士』呢？有的在那裏念佛，可謂在『世外』了，若果你細檢他的行動，則不僅在『世間』，且是無惡不作。有的在游覽名山勝水了，實際上是在鈎心鬥角，取奇制勝，愚弄小民。有的是在養病，所謂病，不過是一種政治行動而已。此程正揆所謂『不知閒人，忙事更多』，『那得磨墨拈亳，作冷淡生活日子也』。（三）　　徐芳云；『雲門和尚，說法如雲，絶不喜人紀錄其語，見必駡逐曰，汝口不用，反記我語，他時定販賣我去。今號爲大和尚者，紛紛語錄，自記自刻，若惟恐人不販賣者，異哉。』看和尚印語錄，其憤慨已如此，若生在今日，看曾ＸＸ詩人刻『打馬將，管他娘』詞，又將如何說法也，而况『曾ＸＸ』以下，還能加上『之流』呢。（四）　　在前人書扎筆記中，往往多抒情小文，今日又得一則。錢陸燦與吳岱觀書，先述二十年前在山中讀書，月夜遇三乳虎，及『小僮阿吉，驚堕枕頭下，』次晨出尋虎跡並在韜光竹上題字事。繼述後再至則已『堂已傾欹，但餘壁落，一僧雛拄門而應徵。曩時君家庋閣筆硯處，及予臥榻，驚堕枕頭處，皆茫然無所向』，三歎而出，想『乳虎已老，老虎已死』。而當時的人物呢，一個是『仕宦秦中』，一個是『飄泊廣陵，』而陸燦自已，是『獨來履葉捫石』，『當時阿吉，綠髮鬖娑，覆額兒也，而葬黃壤已二十餘提矣。』如是，他感到。『人世聚散，便如春夢之瞥然無跡』。抒情文中，惟哀感者最足動人，每讀此類文章，總不免起凄然之感，因記之。雪夜  陳福熙　　門外下着米粉似的雪···　　楊家橋陷在靜靜的雪夜中。　　街燈發着黯澹的光··—屋頂，橋樑，沿河的船篷上，處處是積雪；船艙裏没有燈，靜謐的，幽穆的，躱在黑夜的河面上。一條煤屑路。如在白盡，有汽車，手推車，煤油氣，喧闐閙聲，可是在夜裏，却　靜得毫無　息。　　　近楊　　　堍下的屋子，是一個先衣人的　宅。那屋子裏，住着一對年老的夫婦，他們是專替附近的大學學生洗衣的。　　他們住的屋子，又矮又小，兩幢墻璧上；有大洞，有小洞，掛满銹鉛皮。　風時，風就從鉛皮裏吹進來。落雨要防屋漏。屋子斜傾着，像一隻解了肢體的破凳。今夜，雪緊壓着這屋頂，誰都擔憂它塌崩，好像這一對老夫婦的性命，遲早總要在這屋頂下斷送的。然而，他們並不懼怕，他們最怕的却是下雨，落雪，陰天，因爲下雨下雪，直接會影響他們洗衣。他們是靠洗衣吃飯的，要是一連落幾天霉雨，或是連降幾天雪，對於他們的肚子，不會起恐慌嗎？所以他們憂下雨，憂落雪，簡直比人家憂他們屋子的塌崩更厲害。　　但是兩三天來，天總是下雪，下着米粉似的雪。天落雪，他們不能洗衣。洗好的曬不乾；没有洗過的，堆着。往常，祇要一到晚上，老頭子便去學校收衣，同時，把洗好的衣服分送。　　『老頭子，衣服洗好了嗎？今天還有哩···』　　像這串爛熟的調子，常常剌着他的耳鼓。他總是笑嘻嘻的，張着满口黃牙說　　『洗好了，今天有幾件？』　　每夜，他拿着洗好的衣服去，回來時，盛在大筐裏的，全是骯髒的。每夜每夜。除掉落雪，下雨，常常如此的。　　在日裏，他和年老的妻洗衣。洗好了，還要熨。老太婆身體壞，多洗衣服，到晚上，總是喊着腰酸，脚病，頭暈。他們從不曾僱帮手，不管是冬天，夏天，他們老是耐着苦洗衣。　　現在天下雪，對於他們，實在没有法想。他們没有進賬，所有的錢已經慢慢用光了。　　『老頭子，米已經吃完，明天···到明天怎樣呢？』老太婆躺在舖上，搥着背脊說。　　『到明天···如果天好，出太陽，那就不要緊···』　　『天會好？』　　『說不定。雪已經落了三天啦，不　是應該快晴麽？』　　老頭子說話時，聲音正是低低的，啞裂的。　　但當這時，門外還在下雪，下着米粉似的雪····没有雪（二）  繆崇羣　　正金銀行大鐘才兩點一刻。街心的汽車格外的冷清··倒是草坪上多了幾條帶着金項圈的狗。　　離下班還有一點多鐘，心裏開始覺到悶得很。　　數六國飯店的窗子窟窿眼，從大門往南，十六個；往北，也是十六個。再數幾層··一層兩層，三層　　大英的旗子在桿頂上亂翻，望别處的，老花旗，太陽旗，法國旗···也都是在空中拍拉拍拉地發響－又括這旱風—　　中國人戴上了那付絨邊的墨色風镜，向地上唾了一口乾吐沫。　　　　　　　　　　　　　其實，這里都是柏油馬路，上面没有一點灰塵，那軋士林的濕斑，倒是不大會乾的樣子，滴滴點點地像殷血灌在了街心。　　隨着皮鞋的聲音，看見三五個東洋兵從北邊的街頭跑過來，他們穿着獸皮一樣厚的黃呢制服，帽子上有那麽一道紅箍，怕的是殘殺的太多，血已經没過了他們的頭頂的一種標誌罷。　　黃面皮的保姆，帶着洋娃娃在草坪上玩，跟着他們一陣喊··彎！突！剌利！（one!lwolkthreel）　　瓜瓜—瓜—瓜瓜—瓜—　　　從崗位前面又跑過兩三個東洋兵。　　瓜瓜—瓜—瓜瓜—瓜—　　五六個。　　瓜瓜—瓜—瓜瓜—瓜—　　又是三四個。　　半點鐘之内差不多過去了有兩排人，都是徒手穿着大皮鞋—皮鞋的　量加起來恐怕有好幾十斤還不止。　　西交民巷裏冉過多少兵都是和平的。兵越多越咸風。那是他們自已的僑民的保衛；築成了在我們城市裏的一條『萬里長城』。　　四點鐘的時候崗位换班了，繼續站崗的還是一個穿黃色大清朝代短靴的中國的。　　下班的人不願意出前門繞道子，於是筆直地向南走，不遠地就出了水關—道是外國人早已替我們開好了的一座門，聽說事前也没有考慮過什麽風水問題的。　　穿着一身别緻的老虎皮，從水關出來想一直通過車站，　是没人敢管的。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言也來一論賢妻良母  夢若　　　　　　自從希特勒先生發表了他的『賢妻良母』主張以來，我國人，尤其女同胞們，皆以爲時勢有　不穏了，封建遺毒，或將因此　熾起來；便大家站出來說話。炯女士日昨登在本刊的一篇『賢妻良母』，可算是代表女界的一聲呼喊！　　『賢妻良母』四字，看去是個多麽好聽的稱贊語；誰知幾千年來無數中國婦女，就被套上這一鐐枷，毁滅了她們的生命！本來，賢妻良母主義，並不一定怎樣錯誤；卽女子自身，也不至有人會希望其成爲『愚妻惡母』的。不過從人類全體說，使婦女只做賢妻良母，使她們的生活，只限於狹隘的家庭中，這不僅是女子一已的不幸；就是男子方面，也不見得爲有利；而社會所受的損失，更覺重大，然而男權時代却以此相號召，好不呌人難解！　　如果男子們眞的以爲自已的魄力比女子强，願意單獨肩負社會上所有重擔，因而把家庭中事交給婦女們去管理，敎她們好好地做個賢妻良母，這算是一種分工合作，原也没有什麽偏私。但實際却並不這樣。數千年來，男子之所以不容許女子抬頭，自有其不光明的野心；卽男子希望藉統治權和經濟權的武器，把女子隷屬於自已的控制和宰割之下。誠如炯女士所說；『賢妻良母，是一句壓迫我們的口號；同時也是男人們站在他們本身的利益上而想獲得最後的目的唯一的步伐』！　　然而一直到現在，時代已不同了，婦女却仍舊受着男子的壓迫；這果是男入本身的罪惡嗎？如果不錯的話，那末今日婦女要解除這種痛苦，只要找男子去算賬，以男子爲鬥爭的對手，把他們打倒便有出路了。其實稍具學識的人，立刻就可以發現這種企圖是無益的；因爲束縛女人的仇敵，並非男子，而爲封建思想的遺毒，炯女士所云··『所以我們首先就要知道在目前這樣一個狂風暴雨的歷史的嚴重時期中，我們不希望作一個純良的賢妻，也並不絶對的作一個良母，而消滅我們整個人類的幸福和人生的意義；我們也要負着重大的使命，而推動社會的進展』！這話絶對不錯。但婦女們要做到這一點，自然只有認清敵人，直接向封建勢力去宣戰；因爲封建餘毒，才是女子的桎梏，才是阻止婦女去路的障礙物！　　至宣戰應採擇怎樣的方法呢？有人說；先謀婦女經濟上的獨立。這是對的，女子經濟能够獨立，就不必再去依賴男子爲生，可以脫離男子的覊絆。但要圖謀經濟獨立，自然須投身於職業界，用自已的努力，去養活自已。可是在目前我國這種衰敗經濟狀態之下，許多男子還找不到事做，况婦女乎？現在社會雖也有幾種職業已容納婦女們去插足，然而這並不是女子眞正的幸運。例如有些商店之僱請女店員，雇主的本意，不過是要適應社會需求，才利用婦女來做招徠的廣告吧了；那里眞要鼓勵女子職業？還有工廠之採用女工，那更明顯，就是因爲婦女易於管束，工資也賤，才把男子的位置擠出，讓女子去代替。這又何嘗有提倡男女職業機會均等的意思？至若游藝塲飲食店之安置女招待，其居心更是惡劣。所以我以爲這種不切實的經濟獨立，豈只是女子的不幸，亦且爲婦女運動前途的危機！又有的主張應從攫取參政權着手，這也是很好的。殊不知我國政治组織，自有其特異的性質；婦女要爭得政權，還不是不久之將來所能辦到；况使女子握致政權，女子也不一定便有出路。還有一般倡導敎育平等的人，他們以爲婦女若得到敎育上相當的培養，婦女解放運動，就有成功的希望。這種論調初聽亦甚有理；然而今日的中國敎育，實非無産婦女大衆所能享受。並且我國現在對婦女所施的敎育，不也還是一種賢妻良母主義的敎育嗎？所以這也不是良善方法。　　那末。中國婦女不是没有去處了嗎？那又不然。我們要知道，婦女問題並不是婦女單獨的問題，而是整個社會的問題。婦女地位的轉變，乃隨社會制度的轉變而轉變。原始社會，婦女不是握有絶大的威權嗎？降至封建社會，婦女才附屬於男子，變成男子的奴隷或私産。直到現在資本主義社會，婦女又陷於商品的地位了。所以我們主張，今後中國婦女運動，根本應從改良社會起手；社會制度改變，婦女才能得到解放。不然則在現今我國環境下，被壓迫的婦女，不但尋不到出路；恐怕就是要俯首帖耳地馴馴伏伏去做個不願意做的賢妻良母，也有些困難了！私德的重要  老牌　　有些人以爲『在一切的活動裏，爲着要逹到自已的目的，可以不必選擇手段。因爲在這一瞬間，你是神聖的，你不能爲着某種道德關係，而放棄你的成功』。這似是一種可敬佩的豪語。照這樣說來，在决鬥那一瞬間，是用不着選擇手段的，這，固然是一個决鬥者的必然態度，然而在這裏也有可慮的地方。從個人的立塲看來，也許是引人敬仰，讚嘆；不過，從反面看，就是從决鬭所給予社會的影響方面看，却不能不使我們焦慮了。比如你是一個政治家，而是站在『在野』的地位。現在恰巧『在政』黨遭逢着一個絶大的艱困時期，在應付上已經顯露出多少缺陷來了，這時候，假使你這在野黨要倒它，是可以很容易就逹到目的。不過在那全盤局面上，却不但不會因調换新的人物而轉移局面，反之，那困難却更會增加，甚至於會弄到不可收拾，這種並不是不會有的。在一般政黨制的國家，常常可以顯出這種事例的傾向。你在這時候，你將採取一種甚麽樣的應付能度來。難道爲要順着你一個政治家的故態，甘願局面弄得更糟，而不能不逹到你打倒敵黨，握取政權的目的？　　所以我覺得私德是人生裏所最應具有的，因爲一個人的活動，直接影響於社會，權位小的，固然影響小些，若是權位高了，則影響就大得難以計算了。當我想起特洛斯基被史丹林放逐的時候，我覺得這時特洛斯基的私德是值得稱讚的。因爲那時候俄國還剛踏上穏定的基地，而反對派領袖特洛斯基却握有巨大的軍權，假使他不顧全蘇俄革命的成功，他要利用他的軍權，在政治塲中决他的勝負呢？那不待說，俄國革命是要遭受着相當的打擊的。然而他並没有這樣做，這不能不說是特洛斯基的私德有他的根基。　　我不反對用最好的手段去表逹他的志願的人，可是我却責成這般活動的人，一定要在他們决鬥的時候，顧慮顧慮他的最好的手段所給與社會的影響，因爲社會不是他們所有的，他們根本没有權力來任意蹧蹋人們。　　卽管堂皇點講，一個政治家，他是常常自命是爲着國家的。但在這個名目的掩飾下，仍有不少的人完全走着和這相反的路途。比如一個政治家，他說爲</p>
<p>Page 22</p>
<p>着國家的光榮决定和别一個國家開戰，實際上只爲了一個橡皮商的市塲問題，一個橡皮商的市塲問題是關切着國家的光榮與没落？再不是，便千千萬萬的戰死人民也抵不上一個橡皮商的市塲？　　舉凡這些，祗不過是些瘋狂的野獸，被瘋狂的慾望將他整個地燃燒着，他缺乏私德的函養，他成了我們的敵人他不應當受我們尊崇着。　　我認爲人生中私德最爲重要，而且是社會責成着某一個人都應該具有的，生存在這種世紀末的社會裏，我們尤須接受社會的意旨，不要以爲有機可乘，便可什麽不顧。社會的制裁是超越一切的！卽管你是獨自個成功了，也必要遭受社會的無法逃避的制裁。所以私德一項，我們不能不有深切的注意。誰的不是？  家爲　　晚上，肚裏剛裝满了東西，疲乏的精神已得恢復；但是尚不能就坐下讀報看書，看看外面的月色極佳，就此獨個兒悠悠地出了弄，踏上馬路散步着向前。初春以來這樣美麗的月夜，我想還是　　馬路的時候吧！因此就振起了他將盡的精力，加緊了他已疲的步代，豫備一氣衢遇這闊大的馬路。但不料他還没有跑到馬路的一半，忽然警笛一聲長哨，只見方纔那道幽綠色的光芒，已變成鮮紅色的了，同時那綠色的馬路的一角，也已變成如染了血一般的怕人底紅色了。在這時候，只見有一輛載着『上等人』們的汽車，張着二只巨大的眼睛射出眩目的光來，從不遠的側面，像噬人的猛虎一般猖獗地直撲過來。　　在這樣可怖的劇變之下怎麽不要使這人力車夫驚得一無所措呢？但想他那牛馬般跑了大半天的雙腿，幸得還有些脛力吧，可以把二個轉展着迅速地前進的車輪，突然地停止了。　　『猪　！你要尋死···』一種如犬吠般的怒駡聲，從那，在這可憐的車夫的二步距離底前面風馳而過底汽車中所發出。同時又見站在電桿下的巡捕，已跑到車夫的身旁，舉手一揮，那無情的木棍，已落在車夫的左肩上了。　　可憐這車夫呀！雖已飽受了虚驚而氣喘汗流着，還加以剛纔侮辱底唾駡和第一次吧！精神爲之一振，挺着胸·昻着頭，一步步地前進。想『吟風弄月』吧！但像不像我這樣底份兒呢？　　看吧！露了整個皎潔的臉兒的明月，像在窺視這『不夜城』裏的一切善惡，眞僞；點點的星光也顯出了牠們明亮的身兒，伴着月姐，雖有時像怕羞地藏進了飄蕩在天空的灰銀色的稀薄的浮雲底懷裏，但是終似不放心地仍要常常出來探望。　　在十字路口的電桿上，發着一道幽綠的光芒照耀着對面的馬路底一角；在這光的底下經過的車馬，行人也都要變成綠油油地使人見了凄然。尤其是照在迎面奔跑過來的，拉着客人的人力車夫底灰黃色的臉上，愈顯出其青灰得可憐了。　　那車夫見了這綠光，想正是可以橫棍擊。拚命的拉了車子，再衝過這條馬路而向車上的客人所要底目的地去了。　　雖然在這殺那的時光，但是已演了一幕十分恐怖十分危險的『悲劇』了。『這是誰的不是呢？』—在歸途中我凄然地自問着。也許這就是代表着今日的社會中底一切的『現狀』與『矛盾』吧！話是漂亮  麥夫　　許多的大學生談起國家大事來，總覺得中國的地主和資本家若不打倒，中國便好像决没有出路似地。可是一當自已手裏的，錢用光了，寫着掛號信，航空快信也還是没有錢來，甚至於被老子勞叨一頓，說一些什麽生意一點也不好呀，谷子賤了一倍也還是没人買呀之類的話的時候，便總覺得生意應當做得再大些，田地應當多置些，卽管當資本家，當大地主也是無妨的。　　本來講漂亮話是和着漂亮女人一樣來得容易。因爲講是口的運用，看是眼的運用，都不過是一『運用之勞』罷了。從經濟學的觀點講，以最少的資本獲得最大的利潤，這是值得做的。讀了經濟學和讀了各種高深理論的大學生，自然是知道這一點道理。所以每常聽見他們談起話來，便每常覺得中國是充斥着革命的人物和政治的幹才，而只待他們一從學校裏出來，中國便告走上繁榮之路，中國的政治便可澄清而納諸正軌了。　　假使事實果眞能够做到這點，那到是一向所希冀的。然而感覺終竟袛是感覺而已。　　被砲仗嚇了一跳而被人家說是敵人的炸彈，以至自已更生着惶惑之念的人們，一當發覺那是人家满口的胡謅，便覺得自已是受了欺似地。這樣的人是多着的，都是些没有訓練的人。因爲知道楊梅瘡，名貴的香檳，衹不過一堆泡沫，而漂亮的說話只不過空口放大砲而已。這也只要吐出口中一口唾沫，用力的『呸！』了一聲，也便無事了。至於那般堅持着『大學生還是如此，中國將來怎堪設想！』的意見的人，那只是些老發昏，我們除了讓他去發昏之外，是不能再說别的了。業餘信箱　　妾　　編者先生··　　我有一姊姊，從前被去世的父親，將她給人做妾。實在那人娶她，不過因後嗣關係，並無什麽情感。但我姊姊作妾，迄今已經十年，仍無生育，因之她愈被虐待，比奴婢不如。她想要求脫離，他又不允准，我的姊姊後顧茫茫，苦恨不可名狀。現在我謹替她請問··　　一，她與他再直接請求脫離關係，收回當日字據，妥當否？　　二，他不允准，是否有法律的根據　　三，納妾觸犯法律否？　　四，他可有理索回當日禮金否？　　五，她可以要求赡養金否？　　務懇　　先生垂憐，於報端解答，謹祝健康　讀者王善慶上　　答··納妾制度爲我國舊社會的一種惡俗，是亟應廢除的，是現在法律禁止的。令姊旣不願爲人作妾，自由離異，是决無問題。如『那人』不許，可向法院訴請離異。『當日禮金』他没有理由可以索回。而令姊要求赡養金，如有正當理由，却是可以的。編者毛哥哥寳妹妹　遊世界  猛裝　出賣　　人販大娘打開門，手拿衣服笑盈盈家好這個　哪個··打扮　　送給買主去看　大娘心　　算　　　　··心想這回可賣多少錢，走到　路中，毛　　向前街　　　　哈把大娘　開了；寳　毛哥再前跑，大娘急　喊不好；小說露露的勝利  義大利Ｍ賽拉歐作　景心譯　　　　蘇菲亞工作着並没有抬頭，她的纎細的手指巧妙地在那精緻的花邊上動着。但是露露在屋裏走來走去，有時，移動着架上的裝飾品，有時無味地打開抽屜看。這顯然看得出她是要作什麽事，或是要講什麽話的，但是她姊姊的那種莊嚴的態度把她威嚇住了。她哼了幾句歌，誦了一首詩，但是蘇菲亞像是没有聽見似的。於是這位一向没有多大忍耐心的露露，就决定把話簡截了當地說出來，自已停在她姊姊的面前，說道··　　『蘇菲亞，你曉得楊奈特告訴我的是什麽事麽？』　　『一定不會有什麽很要緊的事。』　　『你的這種答話又冷又硬，就是在夏天聽到都使人打寒戰！你從那里得來你的冰，啊，我的冰冷的姊姊？』　『露露，你老是這麽孩子氣！』　　『哼。這正是你看錯的地方。我的心靈的偶像。我已經不是一個孩子了，我就要結婚的。』　　『什麽？』　　　『這話就是楊奈特告訴我的。』　　『眞没道理！我簡直不懂你說的是什麽。』　　『好的，現在我把整個的事情告訴你，這事也許像是不眞吧—可是你肯不肯用心聽我的話呢？』　　『好吧，好吧，但是講你快一點兒。』　　『時候就是賽馬的那一天，地點就在馬爾斯跑馬廳，你没有在那里；你總是喜歡讀你那些老古書。』　　『如果你說話這樣地不靠題，我可不再聽你的話了。』　　『你必要聽的；這件秘密快要窒息死我了。』　　『你又要說閒話麽？』　　『我不說了，我不說了。喔，其次是，在跑馬廳，我們坐在頭等座的前排。保羅，樓瓦羅來了，給我們介紹了一個漂亮青年，名呌羅勃托，孟特甫蘭寇。在通常的寒喧和無味應酬之後，他們就在我們的身後找到了位置；我們說了幾句話，一會兒賽馬就開始了。你記得我是喜歡俗岡那匹馬的，不管牠怎麽對不注我，我也老買牠—一個人就是對於獸類池顯該不記　多的　一　　霧把許多馬匹包在</p>

<p>Sun Dianying Plans to Go to Taiyuan and Reside Temporarily</p>
<p>Please Do Not Have Ma Hongkui Pursue</p>
<p>He [Yingqin] Calls Generals to Discuss Military Affairs</p>
<p>No Attacks During Negotiations</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin Invited Senior Generals in Beiping, including Wan Fulin, Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, Pang Bingxun, etc., to a meeting at Jurentang at 10 a.m. on the 2nd to discuss the aftermath of Sun's troops. Decisions depended on the results of Sun and Fu's trip. If satisfactory, the three items explained in the telegrams of the three commissioners Pang, Hu, and Ji could be handled. If Sun still refuses to leave the military and makes further demands, a joint encirclement and suppression by a large army will be implemented immediately. During the peaceful negotiation period of the Sun incident, the Northwest authorities will only encircle and not attack. Therefore, there are no fierce battles at the front. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain source, Sun's army did once occupy Ningyuan, but due to the joint counterattack of the Four Mas, they withdrew again. Now, Sun has decided to reside in Taiyuan, and his troops will be stationed, reorganized, and reduced in size along the borders of Gansu, Ningxia, and Suiyuan, as determined by Pang and others. He has requested Ma Hongkui not to send troops to pursue, and telegraphed Ma, stating that there was a misunderstanding and that he has decided to reside temporarily in Taiyuan, asking that room be left for future meetings and ordering that no troops be sent in pursuit, etc. Ma has telegraphed this intention, and it is expected that after Fu Zhankui and others arrive at the front, the peaceful resolution plan can be materialized. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi, accompanied by Fu Zhankui, Men Bingyue, and senior staff officers of the military commission, Zhang Xuanze and Wang Zhongquan, arrived in Suiyuan on the 1st. On the 2nd, they telegraphed Beiping, reporting that Li Ming had already gone to Baotou to take a car prepared by the provincial government to Dengkou to negotiate the aftermath of Sun's troops. Fu, Zhang, and Wang will change trains at 2 p.m. on the 2nd to Baotou and then Dengkou to meet Sun. Men will remain in Suiyuan temporarily to handle all military liaison tasks. Fu will go to the front in three or four days to supervise military affairs. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain member of the military commission said that Fu Zhankui went to Suiyuan with handwritten letters from He, Pang, Hu, and Ji, which mainly stated that Fu would go to discuss everything in person and verbally convey their sincere advice, believing that at this time of national crisis, he should consider the overall situation, prioritize the country, pull back from the brink, and not be despised by the people of the country. The outcome of Fu's trip is difficult to predict, but it is generally believed that Sun personally may not have great difficulties. Whether his subordinates will obey is uncertain and cannot be immediately judged. There is no full assurance. If Sun is determined to leave the military, Fu will also accompany him to Taiyuan. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin received a telegram from Fu Zuoyi today, reporting that Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry troops had opened up to Baotou and were advancing towards Linhe. After receiving the telegram here, he ordered Fu to command the various units to continue westward. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui telegraphed Beiping, reporting that the various units of Sun's army had repeatedly failed in their attacks and no longer had the ability to counterattack. Sun had indeed gone to the front to supervise the troops a few days ago, but due to the unfavorable war situation, he has returned to the rear to reorganize the remnants. The war situation in Ningxia and Pingluo has not changed significantly. In addition, a certain officer of Sun's army talked to Beiping, saying that Yu Shiming's cavalry had largely bypassed Ningxia and advanced south, with the vanguard reaching Zhongwei. Two brigades of Sun's infantry are currently stationed in Ningsuo. Ningxia is defended by Ma Lin leading a division. Most of Sun's rear is concentrated west of Dengkou, which is defended by Sun's Peng Zhenguo's troops. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Ma Yinchu's Opinion on the Silver Agreement <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Advocates Not Approving It</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu's opinion and thoughts on the Silver Agreement are over 3,000 words long. The conclusion is that it is best not to approve the Silver Agreement. Moreover, the United States itself has not fulfilled the agreement, buying 10 million ounces per month for ten consecutive months, totaling 100 million ounces, which has destroyed the balance of supply and demand. How can China be forced to comply? This is the first point. Previously, when the price of US gold was high, the value of its gold coins was also reduced, about 60% of the previous value. Previously, one ounce of pure gold could be exchanged for 23 US dollars, but now it is 35 US dollars, and there are even advocates for 40 US dollars. Then its fineness is already below 800/1000 in the standard currency. How can China be forced not to reduce the fineness of its gold coins to below 800/1000? This is the second point. If the agreement is to be approved, free conditional conditions should be added. The proposed clause is as follows: "If the price of silver rises sharply and has an adverse impact on China's finance and industry, the Chinese government, out of necessity to protect industry and reform the currency system, shall be free to take appropriate actions." On the one hand, please jointly study with national industrial and commercial leaders and economic experts, such as Gu Jigao, Sun Zeng, Liu Dajun, Liu Zhendong, Huang Yuanyi, and Bai Aide. All six of them need to be consulted. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Silver Agreement was not submitted for discussion at the Legislative Yuan's general meeting on the 2nd and is still under review by the Economic, Finance, and Foreign Affairs committees. According to a certain committee member, the case was sent to the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 1st, and a joint meeting was held by the three committees in the afternoon to review it. President Wang also sent a member to the meeting to report. At that time, some members believed that the case was of great importance and could not be completed in a hasty review, and they advocated making a preliminary review first. As a result, it was passed and seven members were elected to be responsible. They are currently reviewing it and plan to convene a second joint meeting at 2 p.m. to conduct a thorough discussion before drafting an opinion and submitting it to the general meeting on Friday. Whether there will be any accompanying amendments is still difficult to predict at this time. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Submitting Recommendations to the Central Political Council</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 49th meeting on the morning of the 2nd, attended by 77 members including Zhu Hezhong and Luo Ding. Sun Ke chaired the meeting, and Liang Hancao was the Secretary-General. A. Reporting Matters: (1) Reading the minutes of the 48th meeting. (2) The Nanjing City's general budget for local ordinary income and expenditure in the 22nd year was submitted to the National Government with instructions to approve its publication and to order the Executive Yuan and Supervisory Yuan to transfer the relevant matters for compliance and to order the Accounting Department to comply. (3) The resolution of the Yuan, requesting the National Government to issue an order to all central agencies that all taxes, levies, and fees collected without legislative procedures and contracts concluded should be submitted to the Yuan for review before the end of April of this year was submitted to the National Government with instructions to comply. (4) The amendment to the Electricity Enterprise Regulations was submitted to the National Government with instructions and has been promulgated and ordered to be implemented. B. Matters for Discussion: The Yuan held a secret meeting on the morning of the 2nd, reportedly to discuss the issue of the puppet organization and Puyi's usurpation, and to suggest counter-measures to the central government. After several hours, other cases were discussed. Due to the passage of time, it was left for the next meeting to discuss. (Central News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the 49th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 2nd, after the reading of the reporting matters was completed, member Jiao Yitang stood up and made a temporary motion, stating that Puyi's usurpation and proclamation as emperor required a serious expression from the National Government regarding this rebellious action. Peng Yangguang and others seconded the motion, and President Sun Ke announced a change to a secret meeting, requesting all attendees to leave. The atmosphere in the meeting was quite tense. After discussing until 12 noon, the President summarized everyone's opinions, combined three items, and handed them to the Secretary-General to draft recommendations to be submitted to the Central Political Council. The contents: (1) The National Government should issue a declaration, notifying all countries of the world, reiterating the significance of not recognizing the puppet organization, hoping that the countries would sympathize and unanimously deny it. (2) Prevent domestic traitors from engaging in activities for the puppet organization and establish methods for punishing traitors to be implemented by military and political organs. (3) Overthrowing the Qing Dynasty was the consensus of the people of the whole country. The current actions in the Northeast are carried out under the coercion of the Japanese. The government should issue a statement, explaining the righteousness and proclaiming to the national citizens to unanimously deny the puppet organization. After the meeting, the Secretariat drafted a recommendation letter and submitted it to the Central Political Council for adoption. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Germanic Empire and Hitler <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Heng</p>
<p>Historians who discuss European civilization often say that Greece was succeeded by Rome, and Rome was succeeded by the Germanic people. After reading Western history, we are even more convinced of this. When Greece declined, it was conquered by Rome, and its culture was also inherited by Rome. When Rome declined, it was conquered by the Germanic people, and even the name of the empire it had built was inherited by them. The so-called Holy Roman Empire was not really an empire of the Romans but an empire of the Germanic people. Later, the Germanic people also contributed greatly to maintaining Western European civilization by blocking the Huns in Austria, resisting the Turks in the lower Danube, and hindering the westward advance of the Mongols. Looking at the fact that there are still 18 million Germanic people living in various places in continental Europe outside of Germany today, one can imagine the grandeur of the Germanic people's conquests in those days. Therefore, from a historical perspective, the Germanic people are indeed a great nation in Europe with a long-standing reputation. When Napoleon ravaged Germany, the Germanic national spirit was aroused again. After half a century of brewing, under the leadership of Prussia, various states united to create the empire before the Great War. The Germans called this empire the Second Empire, so as to distinguish it from the Holy Roman Empire of the past. The power and splendor of this empire still excites the Germans today. Hitler took advantage of this and called for the creation of the Third Empire, meaning that if the Germanic nation wants to restore its past glory and create future achievements, it must first unite the Germanic people scattered in various places into a large group. His ambition is truly astonishing. Judging from the past history of the Germanic nation, it cannot be said to be a completely empty and extravagant hope.</p>
<p>However, today's international environment is very different from the international environment of the previous two empires. The methods adopted by Hitler are also clumsy and inappropriate. When Charlemagne the Great rose, the Roman Empire was already old and declining, while the Germanic people were strong and good at fighting. The law of the jungle was very easy. Moreover, at that time, there were no strong countries monitoring its side, so it could do whatever it wanted. By the time the Second Empire was established, there were four strong European countries: Russia in the north, Austria in the east, France in the south, and England, which dominated the seas, across the strait to the west. Therefore, there was already more resistance in the international arena. With Bismarck's skillful and flexible diplomatic skills, he was still able to use the international situation at the time to allow this empire to be born safely. When we read the history of that time, we know that Bismarck was able to create a great career because he showed people that he was incapable, so that people did not know that he had the grand ambition of unifying the 38 states of Germany into a great power; he formed many alliances to trap the enemy in isolation; and he challenged people but instead made people bear the name of being the instigator of the war. Therefore, during the Austro-Prussian War, Austria was full of arrogance and was pressing hard. International observers also allowed the Austrians to win, so they all secretly sided with the Prussians. When the Prussians won and became the leader of the Germanic Confederation, they were resented by Napoleon III of France. On the eve of the Franco-Prussian War, the French were arrogant and invincible. Prussia hid its strength in many ways, so that its sharp edge was not revealed. Therefore, England, Russia, and other countries were all worried, Italy even helped Prussia attack France, and Austria also remained neutral. The French lost all sympathy in the international arena. As a result, Prussia directly attacked Paris. After these two wars, the Germanic states united with each other, and the German Empire was formally established. From this point of view, Bismarck's way of winning was to conserve energy and hide his strength internally. The enemy did not realize it and was taken advantage of. Bismarck was deeply aware of the subtleties of the saying "the mournful one wins" in the military.</p>
<p>As for the current Hitler, it is not the same. The environment he is in is even more difficult than before the unification of the Germanic states. After the Great War, people have suffered enough from the terror of German militarism and are heavily guarded. The Germans are bound by the peace treaty and have no colonies to supply raw materials, so it is difficult for them to realize their ambitions. Therefore, for Hitler, it is more appropriate to follow Bismarck's old wisdom of conserving energy and waiting for the opportunity, and to make full use of the contradictions between countries to gain the sympathy of countries other than the hypothetical enemy. However, Hitler does not care about the international situation or the strength of the country. He first shows people a ferocious face and alarming words, so that those who have hatred guard against him even more, and those who have no hatred turn into enemies. Up to today, he has not only incurred the jealousy of the Russians, but also lost the favor of the English. France and the Little Entente are out of the question. Even Austria, which is said to be of the same culture and race, is also at odds with him. In short, it is all caused by his fondness for high-sounding theories and a fierce appearance. If he continues to act willfully, not only will the Third Empire not be established, but he will also create many enemies and put Germany in a situation from which it cannot recover. If Hitler really wants to achieve great things, why not follow Bismarck's policies?</p>

<p>Telegrams Ordered the Beiping Authorities to Make Serious Representations to the Japanese Side</p>
<p>(Nanjing) More than a thousand Japanese troops in North China departed from Tianjin and conducted large-scale joint exercises in the area along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway towards Liangwangzhuang, Tangguantun, and Jinghai. The Hebei Provincial Government's polite refusal was ineffective. Telegrams have been sent to the Central Government, the Beiping Military Sub-Commission, and the Political Consolidation Council for instructions. At the same time, the Railway Ministry also received a report from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau, requesting instructions on how to deal with the situation. The government believes that this move by the Japanese side not only violates the Boxer Protocol but also disregards our country's sovereignty. It has now telegraphed the Beiping Military and Political Committees, ordering them to make serious representations to the Japanese side and exchange places for exercises to avoid misunderstandings. It is also heard that the Central Government is paying close attention to the recent actions of the Japanese side in North China and is considering countermeasures. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army stationed in Tianjin divided the exercises and marches along the Tianjin-Pukou Line into two major groups. The first group was designated as the Southern Army and bivouacked in Tangguantun and Jinghai. The second group was designated as the Northern Army and bivouacked in Liangwangzhuang. Commander Nakamura of the military headquarters personally went to review them. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Station offices in the area were mostly temporarily occupied by the Japanese army. On the 3rd, there was a scrimmage exercise, and on the morning of the 4th, the final exercise was held at the Guandi Temple in Gedacun, a southwestern suburb of Tianjin. In the morning, they returned to the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple. It was found that the area of this exercise by the Japanese army fundamentally violated the Boxer Protocol. Their strong demand for vehicles from Tianjin-Pukou and their self-designated name as the "Japanese Road Protection Team" are particularly inappropriate. (Central News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng returned to Ping from Tongxian last night. It is scheduled to go to Gubeikou at 8:00 AM on the 3rd to handle the reception. According to reports, of the five small passes affiliated with Gubeikou, such as Baimaguan and Dashuiyu, only Paizilu and Liangko still have a small number of Japanese troops, while the rest have already withdrawn. When we take over, we will immediately dispatch security teams for defense. It is incorrect to say that the pseudo-customs at various passes of the Great Wall have increased import and export duties since yesterday. Moreover, the Japanese side has already withdrawn to outside the passes when the pseudo-customs are handed over to each pass. In the future, after a negotiated solution, they can also be cancelled. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng is scheduled to go to Gubeikou again early on the 2nd to handle the reception. On the 2nd, Yin telegraphed Yu Xuezhong, reporting that the Japanese 7th and 8th Divisions at Gubeikou had completed their rotation of troops and that the reception could be implemented before noon on the 4th. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that the bandits in Qian'an and Zunhua have been pacified and the local area is safe. It is not easy to administer the counties east of Wan.

<p>(London) Today, Changchun is holding a celebration for Puyi's usurpation of the throne, and the House of Commons is also discussing the "Manchukuo" issue. A question was asked to Foreign Secretary Simon regarding which countries, other than Japan, want to recognize "Manchukuo." Foreign Secretary Simon replied that he had not received any reports of any countries wanting to recognize "Manchukuo." This question was raised by Conservative MP Post. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) General Ryo Hishikari, the ambassador stationed in "Manchukuo," and Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu of the puppet government exchanged official documents regarding the establishment of the "Manchu Empire" at 3:00 PM yesterday. The document submitted by Zheng Xiaoxu to Ambassador Hishikari stated that "Manchukuo" had established a constitutional monarchy today and hoped that this intention would be conveyed to the government of your country. The document submitted by Ambassador Hishikari to Zheng Xiaoxu stated that the Japanese government had notified this ambassador of the intention to acknowledge the notification. This ambassador has the honor of replying based on this instruction. (2nd Dentong Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) On February 16th of this year, the British government notified the Secretary-General of the League of Nations that the London Post Office had received a letter from the Postal Administration of "Manchukuo" requesting that various statistical tables be sent to "Manchukuo" in accordance with the provisions of the Postal Union Convention in order to settle the postage for mail sent to and from Manzhou via transit. The British government is very willing to know to what extent foreign post offices have a factual relationship with the "Manchukuo" post office without giving the impression of recognizing the existing organization of Manzhou. After receiving the notification, Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, decided to convene the advisory committee organized by the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on February 24, 1933, in order to study methods that would enable the postal regulations to be implemented between various countries and Manzhou on the one hand, and not give the impression that various countries recognize "Manchukuo" on the other. It is heard that this advisory committee will be held in Geneva in the near future for discussion. (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Said to be a Sharply Pointed Blade Flashing from Tokyo</p>
<p>The Times Actually Speaks for Japan</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian commented on Puyi's assumption of the throne today, saying, "If 'Manchukuo' exists and has an emperor, then violence has led to it. The organizational laws limit Puyi's various powers and place jurisdiction in the hands of Japanese advisors. Those who maintain the paradise of 'Manchukuo' and expand it are sharply pointed blades flashing from Tokyo." (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Most newspapers today also commented on Puyi's usurpation of the throne in lengthy articles. The Times expressed sympathy for Puyi and praised his achievements, vaguely saying, "'Puyi declared that since taking office as the chief executive, he has done his best to eliminate international shocks and eliminate the ravages of warlords and bandits for the people, so that they can live and work in peace, and he has also unified the currency to stabilize it,' which is still reasonable. Although the new organization in Manzhou has no other achievements, if it can reform the currency system, it has benefited the local area a lot. Moreover, it can punish bandits, improve transportation, and turn a corner of Changchun into a modern city. In short, no matter how 'Manchukuo' originated, we cannot but express our admiration for the spirit of its organization and its firm will. Countries with commercial relations in the Far East have all expressed satisfaction with 'Manchukuo's' willingness to respect the principle of open doors. These countries must decide how their businesses can operate in 'Manchukuo' without hindering the League of Nations' principle of 'non-recognition of Manchukuo.' It is not too late to act." Journalist Patrick expressed his opinion in the News Chronicle, saying, "Puyi changed his title to Emperor Kangde. The word 'De' is indeed worthy of it. As for the word 'Kang', judging from the current situation, I am afraid that I cannot be so optimistic, because the danger of war is not as great as last autumn, but it still exists." Lord Clive published an article in the Morning Post, describing what he saw during his travels in "Manchukuo" and recording his conversation with Puyi in May 1933. He concluded that he believed that the future of "Manchukuo" would be peaceful and would not lead to war. "'Puyi has a long period of experience and is not lacking in experience. When the time comes, he will move forward bravely, because he believes that it is his duty.'" (2nd Havas)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, based on a report from the Army, telegraphed Ambassador Ota stationed in Russia, severely protesting to the Soviet Russian authorities regarding the airplane shooting incident. On February 23, a Japanese airplane was flying east from Haliudian on the Songhua River and Heilongjiang Rivers in order to contact Japanese troops suppressing bandits. Suddenly, shots were fired from inside Soviet Russian territory, causing the pilot to suffer a graze wound. Also, on the 12th, a Japanese airplane was also shot at by the Soviet Union in that area. However, the Japanese airplane was to support the Japanese army in suppressing bandits in the territory of "Manchukuo" and had no other intention. Please take appropriate measures to prevent this from happening again in the future and punish those responsible. (2nd Dentong)</p>

<p>The United States Proposes the Conclusion of a World Non-Aggression Pact</p>
<p>Armaments May Not Be Used to Invade Neighboring Countries</p>
<p>Nine Countries Have Been Invited to Participate in the Conference</p>
<p>(London) The British government has now scheduled a special disarmament conference to be convened in London at the end of this month. According to sources, this conference will be the most important disarmament conference in recent years. The United States will put forward an astonishing proposal to conclude a worldwide non-aggression treaty, which is compared to President Roosevelt's plan. It is heard that in addition to limiting or abolishing offensive weapons, it must also be guaranteed that the remaining armaments cannot be used to invade neighboring countries. The countries invited to participate in this special conference are the United States, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, Japan, Poland, Belgium, and Spain. The Little Entente countries (i.e., Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia) will also be invited. According to Simon and Henderson's opinions, if Eden's report is well received, then this special conference can at least negotiate a settlement based on the British-Italian memorandum. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed circles in London do not admit the claim that Britain is making a final effort on disarmament, but non-political circles feel that the opportunity to conclude a disarmament convention will depend on whether Lord Privy Seal Eden's report is acceptable. Eden had previously gone to Paris, Rome, and Berlin to explain the British disarmament memorandum and seek to form the backbone of a disarmament convention. He returned to London from the European continent tonight. When Eden arrived, a Reuters representative went to see him. Eden said that the trip was very beneficial and had removed certain difficulties and misunderstandings. The opinions of the two governments (Germany and Italy) on the British disarmament memorandum have been clearly understood. He believes that the opinions of the third government (France) will also be known soon, so his mission on this trip is completed, and this time he has the opportunity to meet with major European politicians, which is very beneficial.</p>
<p>Reuters has learned that the British government is preparing to deliberate on the revision of the British plan, but it is believed that if the British plan is not accepted by all countries, then no country can temporarily propose another plan to replace it. At the same time, London is optimistic that Eden's trip has brought the conclusion of the convention closer. The British Cabinet will decide on a policy based on Eden's report within a few days, which may have a good impact on the overall situation of world disarmament.</p>
<p>The attitude of the United States towards Eden's report is very important, and President Roosevelt's special envoy, Davis, happened to arrive in London tonight, which is very noteworthy. Davis will meet with Eden to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Before leaving Paris to return to his country today, Eden had several hours of consultation with French Prime Minister Doumergue and French Foreign Minister Barthou. At the end of the meeting, Barthou greatly admired Eden's talent, saying that Eden had an exciting and outstanding will. This kind of off-topic statement cannot eliminate the pessimism held by Paris that the future of the convention has not been greatly brightened by Eden's trip.</p>
<p>When Eden left the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the French authorities issued a communiqué stating that Eden had reported to Doumergue and Barthou on his talks in Berlin and Rome and explained the principles of the British memorandum based on this information. Doumergue and Barthou then informed Eden that they would continue to study and notify the French government's decision within days.</p>
<p>When Eden left the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he only said, "We have done a little good work."</p>

The reasons for the postponement of the reception of Gubeikou are related to the usurpation of the title by Pu Ni. On-the-spot inspection of Gubeikou. Beiping correspondence, the reception of Gubeikou was originally scheduled for February 28, but due to various reasons, it was changed to March 4. The reporter went to Gubeikou by car from Ping on February 27 to conduct an on-the-spot inspection. The information obtained is recorded as follows: For this reception of Gubeikou, our side had already completed all the procedures. In advance, Yin Rugeng, the commissioner in charge of the reception, and the Japanese side agreed on a plan to receive it on the 28th. Representatives from both sides met in Gubeikou on the 26th to prepare all the procedures. Liu Youxun, the newly appointed Director of the Gubeikou Zazhi Bureau on our side, Huo Shi, the Director of the Gubeikou Office of the Jiji Administrative Commissioner's Office, and Guan Qinghua, the Director of the Gubeikou Public Security Bureau, arrived in Miyun in advance to prepare everything. Yin Rugeng set off from Ping on the 25th. When passing through Miyun, he accompanied Huo Shi, Liu Youxun, Guan Qinghua, etc. to Gubeikou. He only arrived at 4 pm that afternoon and temporarily prepared the Japanese military club in Hebei as a temporary office. That evening, he met with Nagami Toshihide, the commander of the 25th Regiment of the 7th Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Gubeikou and the commander of the Gubeikou garrison. On the 26th, Matsui, the Japanese commissioner, also arrived in Gubeikou from Chengde to discuss all the handover procedures with Yin. Due to various reasons, it was decided to postpone the reception to March 4. On the 27th, another discussion was held to confirm everything. The main points agreed upon were roughly as follows: (1) The administrative and police affairs of Gubeikou will be completely taken over by our side; (2) The Japanese army and its affiliated organs will be moved out as soon as the houses outside the pass are built; (3) All organs set up by the puppet state in Gubeikou must be removed. However, because there are no houses outside the pass, they will be temporarily moved to the foot of the Great Wall; (4) The inspection posts set up by the puppet government at Nantianmen, Beixiagang and Gubeikou Shangpo should be removed immediately; (5) The reception will be carried out on March 4; (6) The personnel in charge of the handover from both sides will arrive in Gubeikou on the 3rd, and the reception ceremony will be held on the morning of the 4th. After Matsui agreed on all the issues, he returned to Chengde at 2 pm on the 27th. There are three reasons for the postponement of the reception: (1) Pu Ni usurped the title on March 1. The Japanese and puppet forces in Gubeikou forced the people to hold a large-scale celebration. If we were to receive it at this time and prohibit it, it would not be allowed in fact. It would be inconvenient to sit idly by; (2) Most of the public houses and larger houses in Gubeikou were occupied by the Japanese and puppet organs. Although the puppet organs decided to withdraw, it would take time to move. In addition, they were preparing to celebrate Pu Ni's usurpation of the title and had not yet moved, so our organs did not have suitable houses for office; (3) The Japanese army stationed in the entire territory of Rehe was originally a part of the Nishigi Regiment of the 1st Division. The Gubeikou area was garrisoned by the Hayakawa Unit of the 31st Regiment of the Regiment. The Japanese side considered that the unit had been stationed outside for a long time and was due to be replaced. In mid-February, the main regiment transferred the Sugihara Daitaro Unit of the 7th Division to take over, and transferred the 8th Division back to the main regiment. During the period of troop deployment and handover, there were many twists and turns in the handover of military and political affairs. The reception of Gubeikou happened at this time and would be affected. Due to these various reasons, both sides agreed to reschedule to allow sufficient time to prepare calmly. After both sides decided to reschedule the reception on the 26th, Yin Rugeng immediately drafted a telegram and asked the Japanese side to forward it to Beiping to report the process and notify the remaining reception personnel to postpone their trip. However, the telegram was not forwarded by the Japanese Embassy's Takegimiya Shibayama until 12 pm on the 27th. Therefore, Qiu Heting, the magistrate of Miyun County, and Xu Shiying, the commander of the Second Battalion of the Second Security Regiment of the war zone, etc., all rushed to Gubeikou on the afternoon of the 27th because they had not heard of it. Thirty-one policemen who were to be received also drove from Miyun to Shixia on the same day. Yin considered that it would be inconvenient to live in Gubeikou since the reception had been postponed, so he left Gubeikou at 7 am on the 28th with Liu Youxun, Huo Shi, Qiu Heting, Xu Shiying, Guan Qinghua and Xu Qing'en, leaving only one or two staff members to guard the houses there. The police were temporarily ordered to wait for orders in Shixia. Yin and others arrived in Shixia at about 9 am, summoned the police for a lecture and gave some instructions. They arrived in Miyun at about 10 am, had lunch at the county office, and Qiu Heting, the magistrate of Miyun County, and Xu Shiying, the commander of the Second Security Battalion, returned to the office. Yin and others returned directly to Beiping and decided to go to the reception again on the 4th. The Japanese representative is also expected to arrive on the same day. The reception on the 4th is expected to not cause any more problems. Of the five small passes near Gubeikou, the three passes to the west are Baimaguan, Shitanglu and Dazishuiyu. The Japanese army has mostly withdrawn and there is no problem with the reception. The two small passes to the east are Caojialu and Qiangzilou. These two passes are adjacent to Rehe and bandits often sneak into the pass through them, disturbing the people in the war zone. The situation is extremely serious. Now, Japanese and puppet troops are stationed there. After the reception of Gubeikou, negotiations will be held with the Japanese side, and our side will send security teams to station there to eliminate the source of the chaos. The reception of Malanyu has also been recognized by the Japanese side. The Japanese army currently stationed in the Gubeikou area is the Nagami Toshihide Unit of the 25th Regiment of the 7th Division, with about 200 soldiers. The regimental headquarters is located in Hebei. A detachment of Japanese military police is stationed there, with about eight or nine soldiers, led by the detachment commander Ogawa. The detachment headquarters is located in Hedong. A branch of the Japanese News Agency is located in Xiaxiagang to handle propaganda matters. It is the only propaganda organ of the Japanese puppet regime in Gubeikou. The Rehe Sakata Transport Office is a commercial transport organ under the protection of the Japanese army and also has an office in Gubeikou, with more than 20 trucks, which transports various contraband and other goods. There are many puppet organs, including (1) the Gubeikou Office of the Rehe Provincial Government, which handles all local administrative affairs, located in Xiapo, headed by Lv Junfu, with about 20 people working there; (2) the Manchukuo Border Police Team, headed by Hong Lu, with 80 puppet police, of whom Japanese account for one-third and Koreans also account for one-third; (3) the Rehe Provincial Transport Anti-Smuggling Team, with about 20 members, who handle the transport and monopoly of contraband such as opium and morphine; (4) the Manchukuo Gubeikou Customs Collection Office, located in Qiaotou, which collects taxes on incoming and outgoing goods; (5) the Manchukuo Post Office Gubeikou Branch, located in Beijie. In addition, the organs set up by the local people under the coercion of the Japanese puppet regime include the Local Maintenance Association and the Defense Regiment. The Japanese army claimed that there were no suitable barracks outside the pass and would not withdraw for the time being. Although the Japanese side agreed to abolish the puppet organs, there were no active preparations. At the same time, the general Han traitors were very active during this period of handover and tried to obstruct it. However, the Rehe Provincial Government Office stopped receiving people's petitions from the 27th, indicating that it was concluding its work. The local population was about 5,000 before the war, but now there are only about 3,000, and most of the rest have fled and have not yet returned. The general people are quite excited to hear that they will be received. After Yin and others arrived in Gubeikou, they held lantern parades and sang Yangko on the 26th and 27th to show their welcome, which proves that the people's hearts have not forgotten their homeland. Since the Japanese army was transferred and preparing for the reception, Gubeikou has tightened martial law. From 8 pm every night, traffic is prohibited, and Japanese and puppet soldiers and police are stationed at Nantianmen, Beixiagang, and Gubeikou Nanguan to strictly check. Passengers must be searched before being released. Those traveling by car must have a Japanese pass before they can pass. Anyone who is slightly suspicious will be detained. On March 1, Puyi claimed the throne, and the Japanese and puppet forces in Gubeikou prepared to hold a large-scale celebration, ordering shops and residents to hang Japanese and puppet flags and to build colorful arches at the intersections of various streets, which were grotesque and unbearable to look at. From Daxiaoxinkailing to Gubeikou, the traces of war still remain along the way, with iron nets discarded on the roadside and the remains of trenches still remaining. The broken walls and ruins bombed by airplanes and artillery are everywhere, which shows the intensity of the war that day. Nantianmen stands high on the top of the mountain, with a majestic terrain and a general demeanor of "one man guards the pass and ten thousand men cannot open it". During the Great Wall Battle, the Japanese army attacked for a long time without success. Later, they invaded from Badaolouzi, and the natural barrier was lost. After the war, the Japanese erected a monument in Gubeikou Nanguan, "The Brave Warriors of the Republic of China Who Died in the War." When we passed by to pay our respects, we felt infinite emotion. The beautiful mountains and rivers have fallen into the hands of the enemy for almost a year. Although it is hoped that they will be received in the future, whether the exercise of local political power will be free when Japanese and puppet forces are mixed is still a big question. (March 1) Jiang Dingwen's situation when passing through Xiamen and arriving in Guangdong —Following the order of Chairman Jiang to discuss the suppression of bandits— —Chen Jitang hosted a banquet for Jiang that evening— Xiamen correspondence, the Red bandits in Jiangxi Province retreated to the southeast of Jiangxi when the Central Army entered Fujian. The Central Army, in addition to using a large army to suppress and prevent their spread, temporarily suspended the suppression. When the military affairs of Fujian Province were resolved, the Red bandits came out again to disturb the areas of Jiangle and Shaxian. However, the Red bandits had become the end of a powerful crossbow. After fierce battles for more than ten days, they were unable to break through. Chairman Jiang has now decided to unite with four armies to launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression. Jiang Dingwen, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Bandit Suppression, was ordered to go to Guangdong to discuss the joint suppression with Chen Jitang. After receiving the order, Jiang first sent Chen Zhuokan, the Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, Hong Chao, the Adjutant, and a telegraph operator to Guangdong on February 18 to make contact in advance. At that time, it was reported here that Jiang Dingwen had personally gone to Guangdong, which was the reason. Jiang originally planned to fly to Guangdong on the 23rd, but he telegraphed Nanchang to transfer four Sikorsky aircraft to Fujian for the trip. However, due to continuous rain, the aircraft could not come. On the 27th, the Shanghai-Guangdong flight flew to Guangdong. Jiang took the flight with Zhao Nan, the Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, Zhang Jiong, the Secretary-General, and Lin Weiwen, the Director of the Headquarters. At 12:15 pm on the 27th, he arrived in Xiamen from Fuzhou. The aircraft landed on the sea off Monkey Island near Gulangyu. Liu Guangqian, the Director of the Siming City Preparatory Office, Sun Xiangfu, the Counselor of the Military Affairs Commission, Zhai, a Senior Staff Officer of the Headquarters, and Qi, the Deputy Director of the Adjutant Office, etc. went to greet him. After Jiang got off the aircraft, he rested briefly at the Daqian Hotel by the sea, and then gave a speech to reporters from various newspapers, saying that the mission to Guangzhou was to follow the telegraph order of Chairman Chiang to discuss military affairs for the suppression of bandits with Commander-in-Chief Chen. In the past, the bandit suppression in Jiangxi Province was always tight on the northern and western routes, but lax on the eastern route, and it was also necessary to strengthen the southern route. After the Fujian Rebellion was quelled, Chairman Chiang paid great attention to the bandit suppression on the eastern and southern routes. Therefore, the Eastern Route Bandit Suppression Army was established in Fujian Province, with his brother as the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route. From now on, the northeastern and western routes can be connected and coordinated. His brother went to Guangdong to discuss the connection between the southeastern and western routes and the bandit suppression strategy with Commander-in-Chief Chen, hoping to achieve the effect of a four-way encirclement. He would return to Guangdong in three to five days to begin supervising the suppression. The Eastern Route Headquarters would be moved to Zhangzhou or Longyan depending on the needs of the military progress on the front line, etc. Jiang did not meet with representatives of various social groups, and then took the Shanghai-Guangdong aircraft to Guangdong at 1:15 pm. (February 28) Guangzhou correspondence, Jiang Dingwen arrived in Guangzhou from Xiamen on the Guangdong-Shanghai Civil Aviation aircraft on February 27. After Chen Jitang received the news, he immediately sent Zeng Qiang, the Director of the Adjutant Office, and Luo Guangqian, the Section Chief, etc., to take a motor boat to the Nantoushi Airport to greet him that afternoon. At 4:30 pm, the aircraft arrived at the Nantoushi Airport. After Jiang got off the aircraft, he shook hands with the welcomers as a courtesy, and then took the motor boat prepared by the First Army Group Headquarters to the Tianzi Pier to land. He transferred to a car to Meihua Village to meet Chen Jitang. At 6 pm, Chen hosted a banquet at Tuisi Garden in Dongshan to welcome Jiang, and invited Zou Lu, Deng Zhiru, Chen Rong, Liu Jiwen and other members of the Southwest Political Affairs Council to accompany him. During the banquet, Jiang described in detail the process of suppressing the Fujian Rebellion, and also discussed the future suppression of bandits. According to Jiang's speech, he was recently ordered to lead his troops into Fujian to suppress the rebellion. Recently, the Fujian situation has been quelled, and he came to Guangdong to meet Commander-in-Chief Chen to discuss the future suppression of bandits. Only two adjutants came with him. The security of Fujian Province has gradually been restored, and the reorganization work has been largely completed. Now, the work of searching for and suppressing the remnants of bandits is underway, etc. (February 28) Progress in the suppression of bandits in Fujian Province Leng and Lu's divisions recover Shaxian Sun's division is also approaching Jiangle The bandits in eastern Fujian are also planning for joint suppression Fuzhou correspondence, the various armies suppressing bandits in northern Fujian have now been formed into the Ninth and Tenth Columns, commanded by Liu Heding and Tang Sibo respectively, and launched a general offensive against the remnants of bandits in Shayong and other places. The military progress has been very rapid in recent days. The bandits west of Yangkou first came into contact with Sun Yuanliang's division. The bandits were defeated and fled to Jiangle, Yong'an and Shaxian. On the 25th, Leng Xin, Lu Xingbang and other divisions took advantage of the victory to attack the bandit troops of the Pseudo Third Army Group in Shaxian. The bandits first used hundreds of youth troops to charge, and the bandit suppression army used machine guns to sweep. The bandits collapsed again. At noon on the 25th, the vanguard of Leng's division and the Tong Yonghan Brigade of Lu's division entered Shaxian County from the southeast and east gates. When they arrived at the Langkou Gutian area, ten miles away from the city, they encountered more than a thousand bandits, and the fierce battle was quite fierce. As a result, the bandits scattered and collapsed outside the city, and then gathered in the Xiamao area (the border between Shunchang and Shaxian). They were again severely attacked by the 246 Brigade of Sun Yuanliang's division. More than a thousand bandits were killed or wounded, and they fled to the western area of Jiangle County in a panic. As a result, Shaxian County was completely recovered. Leng's division was still ordered to join Sun's division to closely follow the bandits and advance towards Yong'an and Jiangle counties. Lu's division was responsible for the defense of Shaxian. According to military sources here, the vanguard of Sun and Leng's divisions had arrived in Yongjiang on the 26th. There were more than a thousand bandits in the area, who were the remnants of bandits from Shaxian, Shunchang and Youxi. They gathered there. Another unit was the bandit masses of the Pseudo First Army Group and Fang Zhimin and Luo Binghui's troops led by Zhu De, totaling about several thousand. They still intended to resist stubbornly by relying on the dangers. Fierce battles took place in Jiangle on the 26th and 27th. There were also minor contacts in Yong'an. According to another report, after Chairman Chiang received Sun Yuanliang's telegram on the 26th reporting the suppression of the Red bandits in Shajiang, he ordered the division to recover Jiangle County within three days. Sun then went to the front line to supervise the battle on the 27th. The important passes of Jiangle, such as Gaotan and Shuinan, have been captured by the 264 Brigade on the 27th. The brigade can advance to Jiangcheng on the 28th. As for the western Fujian area, the various armies suppressing bandits have established contact with the various armies in northern Fujian, and the vanguard has advanced towards Changting. It is reported that Wei Lihuang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Bandit Suppression Front, will go to Longyan to establish the Front Headquarters. Liu Kan, Li Yannian, Li Yutang and other divisions led by Wei have all arrived at their designated locations, waiting for orders to launch a general offensive against the bandit areas in western Fujian. It is also reported that since the start of the general offensive in the bandit suppression in Fujian Province, the war has progressed very rapidly. Now, Shunchang and Shaxian counties have been recovered by Sun Yuanliang and Leng Xin's divisions respectively. The remnant bandits and the Pseudo Third Army Group retreated to Jiangle and Yong'an. The commanders of Sun and Leng's divisions telegraphed the Fuzhou Headquarters to report the victory, and requested that salt and rice be transported to the bandit areas to provide relief to the refugees. They also led their troops to pursue Jiangle and Yong'an. According to a telegram from Commander Sun yesterday, the remnant bandits were fleeing along the way, and the important passes of Gaotan and Shuinan have been captured one after another. They will be stationed in Jiangcheng today or tomorrow. It is now reported that the Red bandits of the Pseudo 3579 Army Group, who are entrenched on the border between Jiangxi and Jiangxi, know that they cannot resist the large army groups from northern Fujian, western Fujian, and eastern Jiangxi. They have decided to shorten the defense line and guard the counties of Changting, Ninghua, Jianning, Taining, Ruijin, Shicheng, Gengchang, and Lichuan, which are located on the border between Fujian and Jiangxi, as a last struggle. According to intelligence reports, the bandits in Jiangyongmingqing and four other counties have moved their baggage to the rear and forcibly recruited young men to serve as Red soldiers. They seem to be making a general retreat. It is expected that the main forces of both sides will come into contact in the border counties between Fujian and Jiangxi. As for the coastal counties in eastern Fujian, such as Fuding, Xiapu, Fu'an, Ningde, Luoyuan, Lianjiang, Pingtan, etc., local Red troops are rampant. Among them, the troops of Fan Tiemin, Gao Chengxue, etc. (i.e., the Left Wing Vanguard who were organized by Qiu Zhaochen, the Commander of the Eastern Fujian Garrison, during the Pseudo People's Government period to harass Taishun and Pingyang on the border of Zhejiang) adopted guerrilla tactics, colluding with pirates. They usually harass villages and villages along the coast and specialize in looting salt and millet, which they distribute to farmers and fishermen to lure them into joining the army. Once the army comes to suppress them, they flee into the sea. As a result, their party members are increasing day by day, and the local area is suffering unspeakably. They urgently need joint suppression by the sea and land forces to be cleared. It is reported that the Fuzhou Headquarters is planning a joint suppression method with the Majiang Naval Port Command. At the same time, the Provincial Government also intends to order the Maritime Public Security Bureau to plan to restore the water police outposts on the coastal islands and set up police ships to specialize in capturing these Red pirates. (February 28) Zhang Xueliang takes office as Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression in Hubei Zhang swears to defend the country Hankou correspondence, Zhang Xueliang, the Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei and Anhui, held an oath-taking ceremony at the headquarters in Wuchang at 9 am on the 1st. Zhang Qun was sent by the Central Government, Xia Douyin was sent by the National Government, and He Chengjun was sent by the Military Affairs Commission to serve as the oath-taking representatives. Those who attended the ceremony included Xu Yuanquan, He Zhuguo, Sun Lianzhong, Shangguan Yunxiang, Rong Jingfang, Ye Peng, Zeng Yiding, Meng Guangpeng, Jia Shiyi, Li Fanyi, Cheng Qibao, Li Shucheng, Lu Zhu, Fan Xiji, Wu Guozhen, Zhou Zechun, Fang Benren, etc. The guard inside and outside the auditorium was strict. The meeting was opened at 9 am, and Zhang Qun presided over the meeting. After the ceremony was performed, Zhang Xueliang raised his hand to take the oath. The oath read, "I solemnly swear that I will恪遵守遵守 Sun Yat-sen's will, implement the Three People's Principles, obey Hu Guan's orders, defend the country, love the people, and fulfill the duties of a soldier. If I violate the oath, I am willing to accept severe punishment." After the oath, Zhang Qun, the oath-taking representative of the Central Government, gave a speech, saying that Deputy Commander Zhang had shared weal and woe with the Party and the country in the past. Last year, he left the country to travel to Europe and had a deep understanding of politics, military affairs, economics, and various facilities. Since returning to the country, he has been more relied upon by the Central Government, and Deputy Commander Zhang will surely make better contributions. Last month, President Wang and Chairman Chiang jointly issued a declaration that the great plan to save the country should be based on suppressing bandits to treat the symptoms and engaging in production and construction. Deputy Commander Zhang is wise and capable and will be able to implement it responsibly to live up to the trust of the Party and the country and to comfort the people's hopes. Next, Xia Douyin, the oath-taking representative of the National Government, gave a speech, saying that the three provinces of Henan, Hubei and Anhui have been suffering from banditry for a long time. Under the personal supervision of Chairman Chiang, 70 to 80% of the bandits have been eliminated. Deputy Commander Zhang has been ordered by the Central Government to come to Hubei to preside over the matter and will surely eliminate the remnants and complete the mission. Deputy Commander Zhang has just returned from overseas and knows that the strength of various countries lies in obeying the leader and being loyal to their duties. I hope that he will assist Chairman Chiang, influence the masses, unify their will, save the country and survive. It depends on this. Next, He Chengjun, the representative of Chairman Chiang, gave a speech, saying that the three provinces of Henan, Hubei and Anhui are located in the center of the country. After the flood, the scars have not yet healed, and the remnants of bandits are also waiting to be eliminated. Deputy Commander Zhang is entrusted with this important task and can implement what he has learned from his European tour in the three provinces first. However, Hubei has always felt that there are many talkers and few doers. I hope that from today onwards, they will understand each other, work together harmoniously, and work together under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, following Deputy Commander Zhang and fulfilling their respective duties and striving to move forward. Finally, Zhang Xueliang replied, saying that his brother's knowledge is shallow and his experience is not deep, but since he has been ordered to come, he can only work hard with his conscience and blood, following the unwavering spirit of Commander-in-Chief Chiang, and implement the plans that Commander-in-Chief Chiang has set. He also hopes that the military and political colleagues in the three provinces will encourage each other. After the ceremony was completed, the meeting was dismissed. On the same day, Zhang Xueliang telegraphed the Central Government, the National Government, the Military Affairs Commission, and the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, reporting the oath-taking ceremony. At the same time, he telegraphed all parties and separately ordered his subordinates to be informed. Zhang has received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, acting as the commander-in-chief and presiding over the bandit suppression military affairs in the three provinces. He has decided to move into the Wuchang Headquarters within a few days and be stationed for office. The Hankou Administrative Office will be abolished and an office will still be set up. The date of Zhang's visit to Chiang in Jiangxi has not yet been determined. He Zhuguo and others who came to Hankou for instructions will return to their defenses separately on the 2nd. (March 1) Songjiang Temple houses were occupied, and the abbot of Xichan Ancient Temple, Lan Feng, angrily chopped off his fingers. Because the Fenglong Temple belonging to the temple was used as a dining hall and dormitory for the monks, the Bailongtan Primary School submitted it to the Education Bureau and forwarded it to the County Government for approval last year to take over the Fenglong <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>

[I,&gt; First Prize of the Fourth Aviation Lottery &lt;I (Photo by Xu Tianzhang) The Owner of the Roulette Gambling Den Proven to be a White Russian: Neither Born in Brazil Nor Able to Speak Portuguese; Brazilian Consulate's Letter of Confirmation Insufficient to the Case; Gambling Den Has Strict Security with Passes</p>
<p>White Russian Yao Kesutuo, residing in Shanghai, rented a large building at No. 1, Lane 1475, Avenue Haig, and opened a roulette gambling den, profiting from the rake-off. The police authorities discovered this and dispatched detectives to investigate the vicinity of the den secretly every night. After confirming the facts, they reported to the First Special District Court, which issued an arrest warrant. Yao was arrested on Broadway Road on Monday of the previous week, and evidence such as chips was seized from the gambling den. He was then handed over to the court for investigation. Because the defendant tried to avoid the jurisdiction of our country's courts, he insisted that he was a Brazilian national. Judge Wu Xiangzu ordered the defendant to be detained pending verification of the facts, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu opened the court and ordered the defendant to be brought in for continued trial. Police lawyers Ru Bao Yi and Qian Xun Jiu, and defendant's lawyer Chen Tan, appeared in court successively. First, White Russian Yipafu from the Russian Relief Society, called as a witness by the police, testified that the defendant was registered as a White Russian in the society in 1901. Next, police officer Lei Di Nuofu testified that he investigated the defendant's registration at the Shanghai Municipal Police Foreign Residents Registration Office and found that the defendant had registered there on February 18, 1929, also declaring himself to be a White Russian, and that his birthplace was indeed in Russia. Lawyer Ru then submitted the defendant's application to the Shanghai Diplomatic Commissioner's Office on June 23, 1926, to register as a Russian resident, in order to prove that the defendant was indeed a White Russian. Judge Wu then questioned the defendant, but the defendant still insisted that he was Brazilian. The court stated that this claim alone was difficult to believe and ordered him to provide evidence such as the language spoken in Brazil and a certificate of nationality. However, the defendant could not speak either Spanish or Portuguese, the two languages spoken in Brazil, and he did not present a certificate of nationality. He only said that the secretary of the Brazilian Consulate, Bai Taili, who was now in court, could testify for him. The court then instructed the defendant's lawyer to ask Bai Taili if he was willing to testify. Bai stated that he was in court to observe on the orders of the Brazilian Consul, and that the Brazilian Consulate had already sent a letter to the court regarding the defendant's nationality issue, and that he was unwilling to testify in a personal capacity. The court stated that since Bai refused to testify and the defendant could not produce any other evidence that could prove his nationality, it ordered both sides' lawyers to debate the nationality issue first. Lawyer Ru then argued extensively, the main points being that the various pieces of evidence submitted by the police were sufficient to prove that the defendant was No. 181, No. 463186, No. 024753, No. 266319, No. 266006, No. 433521; Seventh Prize: last three digits "396," last digit of the first prize "4," last two digits "04." Fifth and sixth prize numbers omitted.

[I,&gt; First Prize of the Fourth Aviation Lottery &lt;I (Photo by Xu Tianzhang) a White Russian resident, and that the defendant's mere claim of Brazilian nationality and the Brazilian consulate's letter, its evidential weight weaker than the evidence submitted by the police, so that a powerful amount of evidence is not overturned by one document. Furthermore, since the defendant registered at the Foreign Residents Registration Office, then their policy says that every registered foreigner, if wanting to switch to the nationality of another country, should apply to the office, cancelling the previous registration; otherwise, they are still under our country's control. Even if the defendant took on Brazilian citizenship after 1929, and the previous registration has not been cancelled, naturally they are still under our country's control. Next, the defendant's lawyer responded, hoping that the nationality issue be resolved through diplomatic channels. In the end, Judge Wu ruled and recognized the defendant as a White Russian resident, and immediately ordered that the case against the defendant for opening a gambling den and profiting from rake-offs be tried. Lawyer Ru then presented the case, and provided evidence, proving that the gambling den was run by the defendant. Next, Deputy Detective Wu Chengmo and Detective Bao Lisheng testified that they were dispatched to investigate the gambling den, and disguised as gamblers and mixed in to gamble, the den was first set up at 1125 Avenue Haig, then moved to No. 1 on February 8, the den used cars to pick up and drop off gamblers, there were as many as six of these cars, inside the den the defendant directed people, the service was very thoughtful, the amounts won and lost varied, the gambling methods were roulette and twenty-one points, there was Cantonese Pai Gow, and entering and exiting the gambling den required a pass, this pass was also issued by the defendant, etc. The defendant was questioned, admitted that the place was a club, that he worked as a director inside, that the entertainment for members was limited to mahjong, poker, etc., denied that it was a gambling den, the court asked and found that further investigation was needed, ordered the defendant to be detained, and rescheduled the trial for March 7.</p>
<p>Li Xuetang Commits Suicide and a Heartbreaking Suicide Note is Discovered: "Money is an All-Powerful Spiritual Object That Can Overcome Everything;" "The Thinnest Thing in the World is a Beauty's Life"</p>
<p>On the 26th of last month, a young man checked into Room 321 at the Far Eastern Hotel on Xizang Road. He registered as Xue Tang, 18 years old, from Ningbo, a medical practitioner, and later committed suicide by taking poison. The next day, he was discovered by Zhang Zulin, a tea server at the hotel, who reported it to the Laozha Police Station, who ordered detectives to investigate and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, etc., as reported in previous editions of this newspaper. Later, due to the youth's excessive poisoning, treatment was ineffective, and he died from the poison on the previous day. The body was taken to the Fielun Road Morgue for examination. It is now known that detectives have discovered that his name was Li Xuetang and found a suicide note by his side. The tone of the letter was all about economic and romantic troubles. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. After questioning his mother, Li Zhangshi, Guo concluded that the deceased, Li Xuetang, had indeed died from taking an overdose of sleeping pills. The body was handed over to his mother, Li Zhangshi, who signed an undertaking to take it back for burial. Now we have obtained the full text of his suicide note, and we present it here:</p>
<p>"I remember it was three years ago, in the autumn, on the fifteenth afternoon of the lunar September. With a "huhu" sound, that great, merciless ship brought this small, pitiful child from the Yong River to Shanghai. Arriving here, in this wicked city on the sea, seeing the magnificent foreign houses and lightning-fast cars, how enviable! As long as you have money, what does anything else matter? From then on, all vanity entered my mind. When I was resentful, I comforted myself, as long as unexpected wealth came rolling in, what hardship would matter? Time flies quickly over everyone's head. Three years have passed. In these three years, I have written a small history, but I do not wish to tell it all. Moreover, my knowledge is very shallow. Some people say I am beautiful. Alas, hearing this hurts me more than a needle pricking my heart, because I know what use is a man's beauty? Money is the all-powerful spiritual object that can overcome everything. What about love? Ha, it's terrible! It's all lies. A fickle and treacherous environment binds me tightly. I have tasted the bitterness of life for several years now. Alas, so bitter! Mother, my dear mother, please do not grieve over my early death. You must know that vessels have their time to break, and life has its end. You should pretend that you never gave birth to this Xue son. And my white-haired grandmother, how can I bear to leave her forever? But I am really forced to do so, alas. Mother, you must comfort her in the future. When a person is in trouble, relatives disappear, and friends do not recognize you. Alas, it can be seen that autumn clouds are as thin as silk, and human feelings are even thinner. The world is cold and ruthless. The thinnest thing in the world is a beauty's life. Father, you must wake up and extricate yourself, and strive in society. Friends, you must wake up and struggle, and take me as a warning. Dear Li, we are separated forever. Do not grieve for me. Your future, your happiness, is waiting for you ahead. As long as you work hard and study the right books. I do not resent anything, only hate the Creator, Heaven. He has been too unfair in giving me luck. Xue Tang, 23.2.26, midnight."</p>
<p>National Children's Year Postponed to Next Year: National Government Has Already Ordered the Child Welfare Association; Shanghai Will Still Proceed Independently</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association previously received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Committee requesting the National Government to issue a nationwide order designating this year as Children's Year in order to awaken public attention and raise the inherent status of children. Now it has received a directive from the National Government, forwarded by the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, changing the designation to 1935 as Children's Year in order to allow for full preparation and enthusiastic celebration. However, according to a standing committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Children's Committee, the committee has already been approved by the Municipal Government to proceed independently as planned, and may also participate next year. The directive is excerpted below.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Directive Hui Zi No. 1025:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the Association's request to the Municipal Government to designate 1934 as Children's Year, it has been reviewed and endorsed as a case. Now, National Government Directive No. 8553 states, "Previously, the China Child Welfare Association requested, through the Bureau, the National Government's review and approval to designate 1934 as Children's Year, which has been submitted and approved. Now, National Government Civil Service Office Letter No. 475 states, 'Regarding the case of the Municipal Government's previous submission, through the Social Affairs Bureau, of the China Child Welfare Association's request to designate 1934 as Children's Year, it has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, and a reply has been approved, stating that the matter has been referred to the Ministries of Interior and Education. Now, the Ministry of Education's response states, 'The Association's submission is for the purpose of arousing nationwide public attention to children's welfare, and the implementation measures are practical and detailed, and seem feasible. However, the holding of Children's Year requires full preparation for all pre-event planning and implementation steps. The request to designate 1934 as Children's Year is noted, but since many days have already passed this year, it is inconvenient. If the designation is changed to 1935 as Children's Year, and preparations begin this year, all measures for Children's Year will be more convenient to implement, etc.' It is deemed that the Ministry's proposal is appropriate and should be approved accordingly. In addition to ordering the Ministry of Interior to be informed, this reply is for your reference and compliance.' Accordingly, this directive is hereby issued for the Bureau to forward to the Association for compliance."</p>
<p>In light of this, this directive is hereby issued for the Association to comply.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Two Roads Administration Requesting the Preservation of the Small Wooden Bridge at Panjiawan</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Two Roads Administration yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"We are writing regarding the joint letter from eleven merchants at the Dah Yang Bridge in Zhabei, including Hesheng Xieji Rice Shop, Yang Wanxing, Qingda, and Shen Zhaofeng Noodles Shop, stating that their businesses at the Dah Yang Bridge depend on a small wooden bridge crossing the railway to reach Panjiawan to the south. Over ten thousand people travel back and forth daily, making the Dah Yang Bridge and Panjiawan prosperous in commerce and industry. The importance of this wooden bridge was recognized by previous directors, who preserved it on record. Now, the Roads Administration, without fully considering local conditions, intends to demolish the wooden bridge, blocking traffic and threatening the livelihoods of thousands of merchants and laborers. They have repeatedly requested preservation but have not been granted approval. This matter concerns local livelihoods and merchants' interests. We earnestly request that your esteemed Chamber provide assistance by writing to the Roads Administration to refrain from demolishing the wooden bridge, to maintain commerce and benefit the people."</p>
<p>In light of this, the small wooden bridge is a crucial thoroughfare for traffic north and south of the railway, serving as a link for Panjiawan's commerce. Past Roads Administration directors have preserved it to this day, facilitating industry and commerce. If it is demolished suddenly, it will have a significant impact on commercial exchange in the area. Accordingly, we are writing to request that your esteemed Administration review this matter, consider that the small wooden bridge is vital to the prosperity of Panjiawan, and refrain from demolishing it, to solidify our public friendship.</p>

<p>Zhonghua Correspondence School of Accountancy Relocates to Expand Operations:</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Correspondence School of Accountancy, founded by renowned accountant Shen Liren, was previously located at No. 1154 Xinzha Road in this city.

It is reported that after the interior of the new school address is properly arranged, Mr. Shen will greatly expand the school's operations.</p>

<p>The Beginning and End of the Establishment of the Sacred Heart Hospital by Lu Bohong and Others: Adding a New-Style Hospital with an Attached Maternity Hospital; Inauguration Scheduled for 3 PM Today.</p>
<p>In the summer of the founding of the Republic, Shanghai philanthropist and current President of the Chinese Catholic Action General Association, Lu Bohong, and others, in view of the fact that the Yangshupu area was densely populated with factories and workers often suffered from illness and lacked funds for medical treatment, rented several houses nearby and invited Franciscan nuns to provide medical care and medicine. Every day, five or six hundred people came seeking treatment. In 1923, because the rented houses were insufficient, Mr. Lu and other Chinese and foreign Catholic philanthropists raised funds to purchase more than 60 mu of land on Ningguo Road and built new-style male and female wards, a total of five buildings, divided into special, first, second, third, and fourth classes. There was also a kindergarten. Each ward could accommodate 120 people. Subsequently, in cooperation with the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee, the hospital purchased from France all the newly invented radium therapy equipment for the specialized treatment of various cancers and difficult diseases, worth more than 200,000 yuan. The radium alone was valued at more than 100,000 yuan and was the first of its kind in East Asia, as other hospitals did not have such equipment. The hospital also had a large and small X-ray machine, which had strong therapeutic power and about three effects: (1) diagnosing the actual condition of various internal diseases; (2) taking photos to prove the location of the disease; (3) treating scrofula, lung disease, etc. Currently, the hospital's medical committee chairman is Shi Deli, the medical director is Song Wusheng, and the resident doctors for internal and external medicine are Pan Weicen and Hou Yunqing. The radium director is Ge Chengzhi, and the X-ray director is Zhang Youmei. Special doctors for internal, external, obstetrics, pediatrics, forensic medicine are Dr. Xie Bide and the Dr. Luo siblings, volunteer doctors for internal, external, obstetrics, pediatrics, and pulmonary medicine are Mude, and for pulmonary medicine, Auyi Bumei, internal and external medicine German doctor Engel, and doctors with European medical doctorates such as internal and external medicine Xie Yingrui, surgery Huang Wen Er, eye, nose, and throat Liu Zunzhu, skin and venereal disease Chen Bangdian, internal and external medicine Cai Hong, etc., are all leaders in the Chinese and foreign medical communities in Shanghai. The hospital also saw an increasing number of patients, and the original wards could not meet the demand. Therefore, it borrowed funds to add a new-style three-story steel-concrete building with a special-class ward that could accommodate 120 people, and an attached maternity hospital. The internal equipment was all modern and scientific. The architecture was planned by Mr. Lu's son, Lu Yigeng, and the drawings were designed by architect Li Wen in conjunction with Qian Shaoping of the Dongya Construction Company, and constructed by Wang Caihong of the Qia Xing Construction Company. The construction is now complete and the opening ceremony is scheduled for 3 PM today. Bishop Hui of the Shanghai District will be invited to preside over the ceremony, and Mr. Lu will invite guests from all walks of life to visit. It is reported that Mayor Wu and various bureau chiefs, as well as the General Directors of the British and French Municipal Councils, will also attend the ceremony. At that time, Ningguo Road will be crowded with traffic and there will be a grand occasion.</p>

The sons, Shen Hongzhen and Shen Xiaoxizi, both work for a living. The daughter, Shen Qiaozhen, is 21 years old and of good appearance. Since childhood, she was promised in marriage through matchmakers Xu Yujiang, Chen Chenmao, Ni Zhentong, Fu Daishi, etc., to Wang Zhilan, the son of Wang Fanglai, a fellow villager from Xie Xing Lane, Nanjing Street, Hai Chao Temple in the South City. Zhilan is 26 years old this year and used to pull a rickshaw. Now that the man has grown and the daughter is old, it is time for them to get married. The original matchmakers were asked to arrange the wedding, and it was agreed that the bride would be married after the betrothal gifts were exchanged the day before yesterday. The bride's family asked for a bride price of 140 yuan, but the groom's family asked to reduce it, so the matter was not resolved. The groom's family then pretended to agree and secretly planned to hire a car and gather relatives and friends to fake the betrothal gifts. When they arrived at the bride's house, the betrothal gifts were empty, but a group of strong men rushed in and forcibly robbed Shen Qiaozhen, putting her in the car and carrying out the robbery wedding.

The people who helped with the wedding robbery got in the car and fled. The Wang father and son were grabbed by Shen Fushi and others and taken into custody at the second precinct of the fourth district.

<p>Li Guocheng, Who Was Sentenced to Death, Filed an Appeal:</p>
<p>On the evening of August 15, 1931, at around 6 PM, in Room 2 of the Fa Shang Hotel at No. 113 Xinxinqiao Street, French Concession, a Jiangbei bandit murdered his accomplices, shooting and killing Jiang Zonghan, Xia Yongsheng, and a man named Xue, and wounding Zhong Ziqing. Qian Yumin, a detective from the French police station, solved the case the next day, arresting the criminal Yan Jinbiao from Funing and handing him over to the Second Special Court, which sentenced him to death. The criminal refused to accept the sentence and appealed repeatedly. After three trials, the original sentence was upheld, and he was executed on April 6 of last year. After Yan was arrested, he confessed that Li Guocheng, also known as Chen Youliang, a fellow villager who was at large, was the mastermind and that they went to commit the murder together. Later, Yan's family arrested Li in the Rihui Port area of Shanghai South and sent him to the Public Security Bureau. The Special Second Court brought him back and handed him over to the French police station for investigation and prosecution. After investigating the evidence, he was sentenced to death in December of last year for jointly conspiring to commit murder. Li refused to accept the original sentence and hired lawyers Zhang Shijie and Shen Yushan to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, as reported in previous newspapers. It is learned that the main points of Li's appeal are: "When this case occurred, I was in my hometown of Gou Dun Town with the police squad leader Ma Buwen handling bandit suppression work, and I was not in Shanghai. The original trial only believed Yan Jinbiao's confession and imposed a heavy sentence. Moreover, Jiang Zonghan pointed out Yan during his pre-death statement in the hospital, but did not point out that I was also at the scene of the murder. Moreover, there are several contradictions in Yan's confession that do not match the facts. I am truly unwilling to accept this and request that the injustice be redressed." He also named Ma Buwen, Chen De'ao, and Chen Bizhao as witnesses, requesting that the case be heard. The afternoon</p>

<p>Commercial News, Financial News, Gold Market Weakness Followed by Strong Recovery. Although Foreign News Was Bad, the Result Was Still Good at 1.04.</p>
<p>The gold market was quite stable yesterday. The exchange market and public sentiment were particularly good. Although foreign news was bad, the result was a rebound. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US showed declines, but not significantly. Exchange rates, on the other hand, rose. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange continued to rise slightly. London spot gold was unchanged. American cotton rose by two points, American wheat fell by half a point. The wool market opened lower, but did not break the 40 yuan level, and the situation remained stable. Although there was a recovery, Reuters reported that the US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau requested the continuation of the current monetary policy and the purchase of silver, etc. Hengxing and others supplied, forcing the price to the 40 yuan level. After the opening, banks hedged forward positions and closed near positions. The gold market was initially stable but then weakened. It was expected that HSBC would quote the British pound flat and the US dollar up to 125. There were rumors in the market that some US congressmen proposed using silver to repay war debts, but they were not well-received. The gold market briefly broke through the 40 yuan level, but banks subsequently re-entered the market, and the situation gradually stabilized. Before noon, the internal market was slightly tight, and gold prices trended higher. The afternoon market opened extremely flat, and public sentiment was quite strong. Banks hedged forward US dollar positions, and the situation gradually trended upward. Finally, sellers seemed reluctant, and the market ended higher. The Central Bank opened a spot transaction of 105 bars, priced at 942.5 yuan, with red gold priced at 953 yuan. Three-month futures trading was sluggish, with only Hongxing (Yuanyi) selling three-month futures and entering four-month futures. The swap spread was 240 yuan. In addition, there was a lack of supply, and the result was also strong. A record of the day's market situation follows:</p>
<p>Morning opening was 940.8 yuan, down 2.5 yuan from the previous close. Spot goods opened at the same price. The foreign exchange market opened with recent selling prices of the British pound at 1 shilling, 4 and a half pence, and the US dollar at 35 yuan. Dafayongyi and Dayong entered the market to buy. Mackellar &amp; Company hedged US dollars for June delivery at half a yuan, rising to 2.2 yuan. However, with Bank of China willing to fill orders for April US dollars at 115, Zhifengyongheng, Yu Fuyu, Richang Dadecheng, Zhengchang, and others rushed to sell. It was anticipated that HSBC would quote the British pound flat and the US dollar up 125. Banks traded April US dollars at 3.125, falling to 39.3 yuan. There were US congressmen in the market reiterating the proposal to use silver to pay war debts. Tongyisheng, Dayuanchun, Dade, Dafa, Yongjinxiu, and others saw a momentary rebound to 41.4 yuan. Datong Huabi continued to fill orders for April US dollars at 125. Dafa Yong Zhaofengchang sold off, once retreating to 40 yuan. Subsequently, due to Mackellar's hedging of June US dollars at half a yuan, Dadecheng and Bingxing entered the market at over 2 yuan. Yuanmao Yongheng Yu sold off, although falling 1.3 yuan, but the situation remained stable due to banks hedging forward US dollar positions. Pangen Shanghai hedged June US dollars at 4.375, and Bingxing Hengyu Xie Kang Yuanchun Xie Xing Yong and others jointly bought, rising to 3.2 yuan. Shanghai hedged May US dollars at 3.125, then filled the same month at 25, and began to rise. Dadecheng and Cuitai mutually supplied, retreating by 1 yuan, hovering before the afternoon close at 942.6 yuan. Spot goods were auctioned at 2.4 yuan, slightly weakening after the close.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 942.2 yuan, and spot goods opened at 2.3 yuan. The Central Exchange Bureau hedged June US dollars at 4.375, rising to 2.5 yuan. However, Zhengjin filled orders for April US dollars at 125. Hengyu Xie Xing Yong Yuanheng Sheng and others sold slightly, falling to around 1.5 yuan. Dade Hengyu then entered the market, rising again to over 2 yuan. When Sumitomo Huabi hedged June US dollars at 375, Qingfa Yong Xie Kang Fuyu and others entered the market at 4 yuan. However, under the limited sales of Dadecheng Hengyu, there was still a struggle at this point. Later, with Shanghai again hedging June US dollars at 375, it gradually became difficult to close positions, and public sentiment was boosted. Zhifeng Yong Xie Xing Yong Qian Chang Xiang Dalian Gang and others successively bought, rising to 5.3 yuan. Shunmao sold off, and the close was therefore 944.7 yuan. Spot goods were auctioned at 4.5 yuan, after which Yuanmao Yong provided strips to stabilize the price. An examination of the day's market revealed a high of 945.3 yuan and a low of 939.3 yuan, a difference of 6 yuan. The result was a 1.4 yuan increase compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Quoting prices, HSBC Bank's US dollar listing was long 125, at 34.375 yuan, equivalent to a standard gold price of 1006.54 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was about 62 yuan less than the target gold price, 5 yuan less than the previous close. The three-month settlement price was unchanged for shillings, remaining at 711 yuan, about 7 yuan less than the closing price. Account for the current month was 702 yuan, April was 943 yuan, morning water was 702 yuan, afternoon water was 704 yuan. Red raw gold price was 953 yuan. Market trading was quite quiet, mostly around 13 yuan above the quoted price. Only Tianjin Gang sold 700 taels to Yingfengheng, at 13 yuan above the quoted price, about a gold price of over 955 yuan. The afternoon market was even quieter.</p>
<p>Market transactions were active. In summary, Shunli Wanxing Hentai Zhifeng Yong Yuanchun Qingfa Yongheng Chang Yongyicheng Futaiheng were on the buying side, while Hengyu Yuanmao Yonghengxing Yuanheng Zhaofengchang Yongdexianghe Yiyu Shunmao were on the selling side. Dafa Yong Xie Xing Yong Sida Yongfeng Neixing advanced first and then exited, while Yifeng Yong Fuyu Dadecheng exited first and then entered. Dalian Gang and Shunli jointly traded over 1,000, netting over 800 bars. Wanxing jointly traded over 600 bars, netting over 200 bars. Guang Gang Shengsheng had few transactions.

<p>The three-month market opened in the morning at 700.5 yuan, down 1 yuan from the previous close. This price was from Dadecheng selling 28 contracts to Shunli. Hongxing came up and sold aggressively, then sold 42 contracts to Dalian Gang, already at 700 yuan. There were also 111 contracts from Hongxing to Yidayong at the same price, but on the other hand, Yidayong offered 70 contracts from Yuanyi, with April futures at 940 yuan, a swap spread of 240 yuan. After entering the market, Hengyu and Bingxing and others had a strong buying interest. The market suddenly became quiet, but because there were more buyers, although there were no direct trades, the quoted price increased. At noon, with Bingxing continuing to need, the noon close was 702 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon with Hongxing selling 35 contracts to Yuanfengyong and 21 contracts to Fuyu at 1.9 yuan, opening at 701.9 yuan. After entering the market, there was strong buying interest, but a lack of supply. Richang Hengxing Dadecheng and others all had an appetite, so it stabilized. In addition, April futures rose and strengthened further. Finally, with Richang wanting to enter at 3.5 yuan, the close was 704 yuan. An examination of the day's market showed a high of 704 yuan and a low of 700 yuan, a difference of 4 yuan. The result was an increase of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous close.

<p>Securities and Bond Markets Show Signs of Weakness</p>
<p>High Prices Trigger Profit-Taking by Bulls</p>
<p>Continued to fall by 12 to 67 points yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market on the Chinese Securities Exchange still showed no signs of improvement. Large investors sold off, but buying was scattered, so the overall buying power was weak, and the trend seemed to be hovering downward. Because the Salt Tax repeatedly approached 30 yuan but failed to break through, market sentiment was weak. The future may see hovering and waiting for opportunities for further changes, and it may not be easy to see major ups and downs in the short term. In the first session yesterday morning, most investors sold off, with 16th and Northern groups selling off more aggressively, and market prices uniformly declining by 1 to 5 points, with the situation being very sluggish. In the second session, military reduction was fiercely down by 5 points, and prices continued to fall by 12 points. Auctions of long-term Salt Tax securities rose slightly, showing some strength, recovering 5 to 20 points. In the first session in the afternoon, there was some short covering, and strength was seen amid mixed gains and losses, but market sentiment remained weak, and the close remained sluggish. As a result, market prices generally declined by 12 to 7 points or so. Looking at the trend, some people believed that there may be problems with the political situation, such as a puppet regime being established, domestic rumors not abating, and the situation between Japan and Russia deteriorating, which have some impact, but should not have a major impact on the overall situation. However, because market prices are still high, it is easy to trigger profit-taking by bulls and speculation. As a result, market prices generally continued to fall by 12 to 67 points. The total number of transactions was 10,074,900 yuan. A comparative table of the gains and losses is listed below.</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Slightly Weak</p>
<p>Xinfeng Yanghang reported on the 1st that the New York stock market still had no major changes. Treasury Secretary Morganthau's speech was confusing to Wall Street, and there was considerable selling pressure, so the market was slightly weak. Afterwards, there were no exciting transactions, and speculators were waiting for a more definite market trend. Silver mining stocks had a large sell-off. American Metallurgical fell by 7 yuan, due to Treasury Secretary Morganthau's statement that "we cannot say that the rise in silver prices caused this or that." Bonds were sluggish and mixed. The market in the small exchange was also weak. Spot goods were slightly weak, and the trend will generally continue to hover. The full-day transaction volume was 1.24 million shares. (Wheat) Private harvest reports were not valued, and local merchants sold off, so the market was slightly down by half a point. (Cotton) The Punkhai case vote was postponed to Friday, and the progress was slow. Market sentiment was uneasy, and pressure appeared when prices rose, and buyers were unwilling to follow. High prices could be closed out. According to the common opinion of brokers, there may be a reaction. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn Market Stimulated by American Cotton News, Short Covering on Standard Yarn</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the situation was slightly stable. Because it had fallen for many consecutive days, having fallen 89 yuan from the higher prices, it triggered profit-taking, so the market rebounded and rose. However, spot yarn sales in the market are still bleak and lifeless, so the short side's attitude is still firm. Japanese yarn prices are cheap, so the yarn market is weaker than the flower price. Standard yarn is slightly firm.</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning, and the market atmosphere was quite weak, with a lack of buyers. Each month fell by 5679 points. In the afternoon, there was news of good American cotton, and short-selling activities covered positions, with each month rising by 8 points to 1 yuan and 1.2 yuan. The total turnover for the day was 35,500 bales. Among the sellers, Chunji sold 1,100 bales, Dafeng 1,750 bales, Changfeng 850 bales, Suilong 1,300 bales, and Deji 1,150 bales.

<p>Standard Cotton Retracement Reveals Bulls</p>
<p>The cotton market showed signs of stabilization. Because American cotton was stable and gold prices also rose slightly, market sentiment was slightly stronger. However, most people’s mentality was that the yarn market was sluggish, so there was a tendency to sell. However, according to a portion of the market, sources from various regions have not been strong, so a portion of the market buys on dips.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Good Two or Three Points</p>
<p>The Zheng Biao market opened in the morning, and American cotton was up again, so there were not many sellers in the market, and each month rose by 5 to 10 points.

<p>Grain and Flour Market Remains Sluggish</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, the market for each month showed a hovering and unstable trend. Foreign wheat quotations in Chicago were down 12 points or so, and Canadian wheat prices were little changed, so after the opening, market sentiment for near-term and long-term contracts was average. For the current month, because of a lack of interest from customer groups, only short covering was seen, and the market atmosphere was sluggish. Long-term contracts saw swap trading by various factories, and short positions by customer groups were also covered, so market sentiment seemed slightly more stable. Until the afternoon opening, the market was initially stable, but then the factories still offered to sell positions for the current month. This situation was really a sign of a bleak future, so the market fell step by step. Although there were not many factory positions for each long-term contract, due to the current month, it was also weak. Observing the future, there is a fear of an unprecedented decline. As a result, the current month was down 1.25 points, April and May were down 2.5 points, June was down 2.5 points, July was unchanged, and August was down 2.5 points. Only the April contract was traded for wheat futures.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the coldness of each month had reached its peak. The whole day only saw slight trading in April, and the rest were empty auctions. Although it is not yet the time for old crops to give way to new crops, because foreign wheat arrives step by step, each factory's needs are assured. Long-term contracts, due to the excessive supply and low prices of foreign wheat, could not attract purchases from inside or outside the industry even at low prices, so both sides rejected each other, and there was no trading.</p>
<p>The spot wheat market was dragged down by wheat futures and foreign wheat. The current wheat market had 1,500 packages from Fuxin, including 3.4 yuan for Guzhen wheat and 3.3 yuan 4 cents to 3.3 yuan for Bangbu wheat. Arrivals have continued in recent days, factory demand is also active, and the market is stable.</p>
<p>Customer Demand for High-Quality Xiang Geng Standing Firm</p>
<p>Xiamen Pilots Machine Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's customer Xiang market was better than the previous day because customer demand was slightly more active, and trading showed signs of gradual development. The Xiamen group asked about 100 packages of Wuxi machine yuan rice for the first time yesterday. In addition, there was an intention to consult on Hunan and Jiangxi passenger Xiang rice. If customer demand is activated, the market may be revitalized. Also, after recent weak customer sales, medium and next-grade Xiang rice have been depreciated for sale. After prices fall, it may be possible to transport the goods, so the Fuzhou groups in this street have been collecting high-grade goods. The demand for Zhongguan rough Xiang rice is particularly good. The total market opened with more than 3,000 packages of various rice, which was busier than the previous day. However, the price of Zhongci customer Xiang has been pulled down by 35 points, and there are fewer stocks of high-grade rice. However, merchants are still reluctant to sell at lower prices, so although the price of Zhongci has depreciated, the high-grade rice remains firm.</p>
<p>Thick and Thin Geng Slightly Higher by 2-3 Cents</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each group was close to 30 numbers (over 4,000 shi), and the market was still tight. Since the opening of the market, the appetite of the shops on the street has been strong, and the situation is lively. However, it is still difficult to stabilize market sentiment, so the problem of purchasing could not be relaxed for a while. Therefore, the price of Geng from Sudong Nangang and other places only increased by 23 points. The market price of Changbang Geng was soft due to the slightly larger source of supply. Due to the influence of customer Jian, the price of Duyang Jian depreciated nearly an angle. The appetite of the customer group and the adoption of the Nanyang group were less, and most of them were entered by the Beiyang, Tianjin, and Tanggu groups. However, only thousands of Qingjiao Sijing Fenglian arrived with limited goods, and the market could still be tightened, and the market price rose by 3 or 4 points. However, it is still difficult to turn the situation around in a short period of time under the current trend, and the market is already soft due to the normal sales of the Yinyuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 ships arriving from various places, and the sales of various items were sluggish. The price of white Keng and white Yuan was soft by several points, and the price of Yangdu Bu Kejian was fixed. Early-ripening and thin rice was soft.</p>
<p>Oil Market: Raw Oil Opened at 4,600 Pieces</p>
<p>Soybean oil and raw oil have not opened for a large session for more than ten days since opening on a red plate. Sources have arrived one after another, and dealers have stocks in their hands. Sales in various places are not strong, so dealers are unable to deliver goods, and the large session is in a stalemate. At present, except for 310 pieces of factory oil that opened yesterday, the rest of soybean oil is in a state of stalemate. Peanut oil is more actively traded than soybean oil, which is due to the smooth sales in Zhejiang. Yesterday, 1,600 pieces of thin skin were opened, and 3,000 pieces of intermediate storage were opened. The market price of intermediate storage fell by 4 jiao, and the price of thin skin was adjusted by 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Sugar Has a Unique Advantage</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw little change in customs gold, the guild was not popular, and although the price of 24 coarse sand white was still shouted at 19.7 jiao, there were no transactions. The price of Tai Gu sugar from the original factory was the same as yesterday. Chaoqing sugar has recently seen rising sales in the north, so the market has risen, and the stock at the end of the month is not abundant. The origin has reported hard prices, so the offer is also tight. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bags were opened, and the prices ranged from 11.75 yuan, 11.6 jiao, 11.5 jiao, 11.45 jiao, 11.2 jiao, 11 yuan to 6 jiao, 10 yuan to 5 jiao. If sales continue to improve in the future, there will be no further increase.</p>

<h3 id="e61">British, American, and French Air Forces <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>England Increases Four Squadrons, One Stationed in Singapore</p>
<p>America Adds 1,000 Fighter Planes</p>
<p>France Also Strives to Modernize its Air Force</p>
<p>(London) The 1934 British Air Force budget stipulates an increase of four aircraft squadrons. The annual expenditure is £17,561,000, an increase of £135,000 compared to the previous year. Among the four newly added squadrons, one is a flying boat squadron, which will be stationed overseas. The remaining three squadrons will: one, join the naval fleet air force; and two, be used for domestic defense. After this increase, the Royal Air Force will have a total of eighty-one permanent squadrons and thirteen non-permanent squadrons. The Air Minister, Marquess of Londonderry, mentioned the budget today, stating that the US government intends to avoid an air force arms race at all costs. While the results of the disarmament conference are still undecided, the number of new military positions in Britain has been reduced to the minimum. However, for the sake of national and imperial security, the British government cannot continue to accept a position where its air force is inferior to other countries. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The budget for British naval aviation expenditures, starting from April 1st of this year, has been released today, totaling £20,165,600, an increase of £527,000 compared to the previous term. An explanation from the Aviation Minister is attached, stating that the British Air Force is purely for self-defense. Now that several countries are expanding their air forces daily, Britain appears to be falling behind. This term's budget shows a slight increase. Cabinet members have repeatedly demonstrated Britain's sincerity in achieving air force disarmament, but for the sake of imperial security, the British Air Force cannot be inferior to other countries. Therefore, it is planned to add four new aircraft squadrons in the next fiscal year, each squadron limited to nine to twelve aircraft, making a total of eighty-one squadrons in the Royal Air Force. One squadron is entirely composed of flying boats and will be stationed overseas. Rumor has it that the squadron will be sent to Singapore, in accordance with the recent resolutions of the Singapore Naval Conference. (2nd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The proposal to add 3,000 army aircraft was refuted this morning by Secretary of War Dern in a statement. However, the Secretary of War supports the resolution proposed by Congressman McSwain, which is now set to add 1,000 fighter planes and recruit 400 officers and 6,200 soldiers for the Army Air Corps, as part of the five-year plan proposed by the Army General Staff. The resolution is currently under consideration by the House Military Affairs Committee and will soon be presented in a report. (1st, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Reuters learned today that France has no intention of increasing its air force. The reports in the newspapers are unreliable. France has already reduced eight air force squadrons in the past few months. The current reorganization is merely to modernize the air force. (1st, Reuters)</p>

<p>Army Increased to 120,000</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Fey's Ambition</p>
<p>While Vienna attracts Europe's attention, Austria has quietly increased its army from 30,000 to 120,000 men, either directly under the regular army or with organizations easily converted into regular army status, based on the Treaty of Saint-Germain. Austrian Deputy Prime Minister Fey presided over the expansion ceremony of the auxiliary army yesterday, which increased the number of officers by fifteen and soldiers by three thousand. Deputy Prime Minister Fey's newspaper estimates that the strength of the Austrian Home Guard (Fascist Party) and the Allied Forces is a total of 60,000 men, plus the 30,000 men of the regular army allowed by the treaty, and about 10,000 policemen and gendarmes, who are generally recruited from soldiers of the regular army and are easily converted into regular army troops. From this, it can be seen that Austria can now place elite troops on the battlefield. (1st, Reuters)</p>

<p>Bulgarian King in Secret Talks with Hitler</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although the King of Bulgaria's visit to Berlin is officially stated to have no political purpose, the fact is that the King went to Berlin and personally met with various important figures in the German authorities, gaining an understanding of all the policies and figures of Germany after the reforms. This point is extremely important. The King visited German Foreign Minister Neurath this afternoon and had a long conversation for two hours. Then he attended the banquet of President Hindenburg. During the meeting, the King had a long conversation with the German President, detailing Bulgaria's current political strategy. During the banquet, President Hindenburg raised his glass in tribute, saying, "In my declining years, I am very pleased to meet the young and handsome King of Bulgaria. In these difficult times, Your Majesty is still able to manage affairs with ease and has achieved remarkable political results. I offer you German wine as a tribute and wish you good health." After the banquet, the King and Chancellor Hitler left for a meeting lasting about an hour. The King inquired in detail about the current political views of the National Socialist Party and the achievements of the various measures it has already implemented. During the discussions, there was no argument. Afterwards, Chancellor Hitler said that he would personally pay his respects to the King at his residence to express his greetings. The King was modest and said that the Chancellor was very busy with government affairs and would pay his respects first. Thus, a date was set and they parted. These several meetings will certainly make the friendship between the two countries even more solid. (1st, National Telegram)</p>

<p>Japan Considers Withdrawing its Representatives</p>
<p>Further Diplomatic Negotiations to be Conducted</p>
<p>Osaka The Anglo-Japanese Cotton Industry Consultation will hold its fourth meeting on the 7th. However, according to the current situation, the meeting is on the verge of collapse. The collapse of the consultation will not only have a major impact on the spinning industry of both countries, but also have repercussions on the entire trade relationship between England and Japan. Therefore, the timing of the Japanese delegation's withdrawal and the aftermath are being carefully considered by the Japanese authorities. According to the opinions of key figures in the Japan Spinners' Association, the methods to break the deadlock are as follows: (1) The people's consultation should take the fourth consultation as the final meeting, temporarily suspend negotiations, and allow diplomatic negotiations between the British and Japanese governments to change the situation. (2) The Japanese delegation should temporarily withdraw from London and seek compromise methods after a certain period of time. (2nd, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>Manchester The Anglo-Japanese textile industry talks are currently at a standstill due to the scope of the meeting. The cotton industry here has a very firm attitude on this matter.

The current negotiation is a touchstone for Japanese economic policy. If an agreement is not reached, repercussions will inevitably arise.

<p>The Japanese Government Plans Countermeasures</p>
<p>Osaka According to a telegram received today by a Japanese merchant from Surabaya, the Dutch government has implemented restrictions on the import of foreign cotton cloth since yesterday, using 1928 as the standard. It stipulates the import of cotton yarn and cloth from various countries, with the Dutch occupying 60%, other European and American goods occupying 30%, and others 10%. The intention is entirely to prevent the dumping of Japanese cotton cloth. Although it is said to be a temporary measure for ten months, Japanese merchants will suffer considerable losses. Furthermore, there are recent plans to restrict other Japanese goods. The Dutch government's actions are not only for economic reasons, but also have political implications. Recently, Dutch officials and merchants have been very resentful of the dumping of Japanese goods, which has led to an anti-Japanese atmosphere. It is heard that Japanese merchants intend to petition the government, asking it to lodge a serious protest with the Dutch government and demand that the Dutch government ease the anti-Japanese atmosphere.

<p>Shouting "Down with the Government" Slogans</p>
<p>Released Only After Being Confined in a Room</p>
<p>London Secretary of Commerce Runciman explained the significance of the recently completed Anglo-Russian Commercial Treaty in the House of Commons today. It is said that the significance of this agreement is to correct the imbalance of trade between the two countries. The British side believes that if Russia cannot buy more British goods in England, then Britain cannot buy more Russian goods either. Soviet Russia has accepted this view and at the same time acknowledged that the British side has the right to prohibit the import of Russian goods when Russian goods prices disrupt the Ottawa Conference Agreement. Recently, a representative of the Lena Goldfields went to Moscow, and there is a possibility of resolving the company's claim for compensation for losses against the Russian government. Up to now, all payments for British goods shipped to Russia have been paid promptly. Even when six British technicians were arrested by the Russian authorities, causing a suspension of trade between the two countries, the payments were still made as usual. Runciman concluded that this type of payment will continue. (1st, Reuters)</p>

<p>Possession of her Husband's Checkbook Stubs</p>
<p>Paris The wife of Stavisky, the main culprit in the Bayonne Municipal Credit Bank fraud case, was arrested this morning. The main reason for her arrest was that the prosecutor of the Seine Court proved that Stavisky's wife had stubs of checks issued by her husband and other documents that the judicial authorities were searching for. The prosecutor also received a reliable report that Stavisky's wife intended to flee France, so the prosecutor issued a summons today for Stavisky's wife to appear in court. She was accused by the prosecutor of suspicion of conspiracy with Stavisky in the fraud case and harboring stolen goods. During the interrogation, the defendant denied possessing suspicious documents, but the prosecutor was not satisfied and sent the defendant to prison. Also, during the cabinet meeting this morning, Interior Minister Sarraut declared that the checkbook stubs signed by Stavisky, which were seized by the authorities yesterday, had been stamped and sealed. After being checked one by one, they were immediately transferred to the congressional investigative committee for verification. This afternoon, the stubs were photographed and preserved.

<p>Left and Right Factions Compete for Power</p>
<p>Madrid The Spanish cabinet crisis has not yet been resolved, but it is widely believed that Lerroux will still form a right-wing cabinet. However, the newspapers of the left-wing claim that if the right-wing forms a cabinet, it will lead to civil war. (2nd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid The Lerroux cabinet has lost the support of the right-wing Catholic party. President Zamora recently met with the current Speaker of the House, Alba, and the former Speaker, Besteiro, to seek their opinions. The two suggested that Lerroux be asked to form a cabinet again, and that the new government should be based on a broad majority party in Congress. The Radical Party believes that the President will still entrust Lerroux to form a cabinet, but it is heard that former Prime Minister Azaña and most of the left-wing have decided to adopt a clear revolutionary attitude and carry out a vigorous movement in the hope of dissolving Congress and preventing the right-wing from taking power.

According to the reply, there is no police station, but one or two additional staff members will be added to be responsible for protection and to crack down on Japanese residents. Because when unscrupulous Japanese residents commit crimes and are arrested, and the Chinese police hand them over to the Japanese Consulate, ordinary staff members find it difficult to cope, so additional staff members are added to take on the responsibility.
