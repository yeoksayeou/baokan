<p>時評</p>
<h3>我國對外貿易減少與國民經濟</h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>我國今年首九個月之對外貿易統計數字。已經海關發表。（見九月份海關月報）計進口總額爲七九五·一一四·○九八元。較去年同期約減少二萬六千八百十九萬元。出口總額爲三九九·二○五·八一六元。較去年同期約減少五千九百八十萬元。進口超過出口者。約達四萬萬元之巨。由我國國民經濟方面言。此種對外貿易數量之變化。其所含之意義爲何如乎。</p>
<p>從我國對外貿易發展史觀察。入超現象之成立。原不始於今日。蓋近數十年中。除歐戰時出口稍形發達外。幾於無歲不有鉅額之入超。然此入超之現象。果足爲國民經濟之根本病態乎。則又不然。試觀英倫以三島海國。歲需輸入工業原料。數量極巨。入超自爲必然之要。然英仍不失爲世界列強之一。由此可知貿易上入超數量之或伸或縮。均不足視爲國民經濟健全與否之尺度。彰彰明甚矣。我國本年首九個月之入超總額。數量上已較去年同期減少二○八·三八七·七七八元。若謂入超之收縮。即爲國民漏巵之減少。則未始不可認爲國民經濟之好轉。然夷考其實。則有大謬不然者存焉。</p>
<p>今日對外貿易數量之收縮。實爲國民購買力低落之象徵。以九個月之短明期。外貨之進口。乃減少至三萬萬元上下。此其足以顯示人民購買力之低落者。寗有疑義。無怪生銀輸出。已漸爲一種有力的國際支付之手段也。現如海關統計。已明載本年三季生金銀出口凈數爲一萬八千萬元。斯誠爲歷年頹有之紀錄。然亦爲勢所必至。由另一方面言各。國因對華輸出貿易之收縮乃史感覺市塲擴張之需要。與貿易損失挽救之不可緩。彼此之間。將不能不由此引起更尖銳之市塲雖爭。而以我國產業之幼稚。更有遭受進一步威脅之可能。年來飛躍於我國內市塲之外資。未嘗因入超減少而稍形削弱。而國民經濟之病態。則日益加深。即如本年之出口貿易。不能乘外貨入口收縮之機會。而從事於擴張。則殊可惜。天下事惟窮則變。惟變則通。我國國民經濟之前途。將何時由變而通。以達到此好轉之時機乎。</p>

<h3>法軍威脅薩爾德國認爲危同弄火</h3>
<p>全德人民認法對德挑戰</p>
<p>德報警告英國共負其責</p>
<p>英對薩爾問題表示持重</p>
<p>［柏林］法國準備出兵前往薩爾邊境、以防德人運動選舉之消息、已引起德國全境之深切憤懣、德報切實否認國社黨有在薩爾搗亂之意、並責法國志在操縱行將舉行之公民投票大會、德報希望英國毅然拒絕參加侵入薩爾之行動、官塲之外交通訊報警告英國、謂若法國派兵入薩爾境、則其後果英國亦應負責云、國聯行政院定十一月二十一日集議、以研究薩爾公民投票之問題、</p>
<p>據巴黎方面負責消息、如國聯所委任之薩爾管理團主席諾克斯發出警告、聲明當地憲兵不能制止國社黨之活動、則駐於亞薩斯省境內之法軍汽車隊即可立即開入薩爾、估計有數千兵士即可在半日內控制大局、但法國並無用兵之意、今發此警告、志在銷除實行用兵之必要、縱使出兵、亦不用以操縱投票、蓋一俟秩序恢復、派出之軍即須撤回也、以上爲巴黎人士意見、</p>
<p>柏林某要人對路透訪員發表其意見、謂法國現直玩火耳、有力方面如欲用其兵力以施一月十三日之公民投票大會、則無論如何、絕不能維持薩爾之和平與秩序云、德政府某機關報今日社論、間接責備薩爾管理國有偏私行爲、謂法國現準備於管理團認爲可行時、即用兵佔領薩爾、惟無論藉何理由、佔據薩爾、此乃對德之挑戰行爲、且亦爲奪取國聯管理下土地之舉動、全世界必起而痛斥、凡容許此種舉動者、亦必不能逃責云、</p>
<p>同時法國報紙盛傳德國兵力如何強盛之說、據某法報稱、明春德國兵力當較一九二四年德國作戰時爲尤大、巴黎晨報稱、德國陸軍在數字上優於法軍、希特勒背後有坦克車·重砲·飛機·全副武裝之兵士二百萬人云、戰事謠言愈增法國人民對於天空襲擊之恐慌、蓋以大戰後所發明殺人毀屋之利器、以空軍爲最恐怖也、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英政府現密切注意薩爾公民投票時秩序之維持、及法國出兵之揚言、聞英政府處於凡爾賽和約簽字國之地位、深願公民投票公允舉行、而不受任何壓力、並覺國聯現方採行適當之戒備、足以保障此種目的之實現、法罷態度固屬不錯、但英政府以爲如薩爾各方面不喪失其責任之觀念、則法國之所慮者、未必見諸事實、同時英國不欲目前據採行任何特殊舉動、（二日路透電）</p>

<h3>倫敦海軍預會開幕前後之日本現狀（日本通信）</h3>
<p>集中政治勢力　發動全國輿論</p>
<p>對英門戶開放　對美決不讓步</p>
<p>倫敦海軍預備會議、第一次開會的時候、最主要的英美先行諒解、然後再進一求英美日三國的妥恊、如果在會議外交盛行的時候、英美對立不致於十分尖銳、如一九二二年華盛頓會議的往事、英美諒解是可能的、但是現在世界經濟恐慌並未真正到底、英國之所以勉強支撐著、能維擊市面繁榮的原因、一則是靠他的廣大殖民地和自治領、努力實行大英帝國內的聯盟經濟、二則英國首入棄金本位制度、穩定了他在南美·在歐洲·的市塲、</p>
<p>然而美國始終是英國在經濟上最大的敵手、南北美洲的競爭決不能緩和、歐洲與亞細亞市塲的對立、她沒有調解的餘地、加以石油的競爭、重工業上的比賽、於是影響到外交關係、影響到含有嚴重對外性質的海軍、日本於此、曾下過一番研究工夫、曉得英美國國對於海軍軍縮、非至萬不得已、決不會諒解、更不能聯合對日、所以在本年六月預備會議初開的時候、英國是內閣總理·海軍總長·出馬、美國則以熟悉歐洲情形·民政黨的優秀外交家·不掛大使頭銜的臺維斯爲代表、從事於軍縮將來的折衝、可是日本當時並不曾派什麼重要大員、即海軍所派的人、也遲遲其行、直到英美會商停頓、日本還祇是用一種尋常的外交應付手段、</p>
<p>就表面觀察、日本似乎不曾預備用積極方法去對應海軍預備會議、老守著他的孤立外交、其實不然、他曉英美諒解不能成功、至少是難於成功、他還有籌劃的餘裕、所以他特召駐美大使及駐法·意諸國大使回國、準備外交的總動員、同時其國內一般羣衆、都市上大概耽於娛樂、即令竭力注射強心劑、反應依然很小、而左傾思想的蔓延、又很可怕、至於資本家則盡力講求投資的安全、不肯多冒險、所以非常時期的調子、縱然唱得高、究竟不甚實在、要海陸兩方面應付、未見得怎樣容易、何況財政上儘發行公債、鼓吹非常時期、到底不是常法、因此他要刺激其國民、發動全國輿論、提倡所謂舉國一致、把所有各黨派勢力在軍部領導之下、統率起來、以赴軍備縮小會議、</p>
<p>假如英美真聯結起來、共分太平洋霸權、則日本立塲是很困難的、不過英日在歷史上有過同盟關係、現在政治上依舊有諒解的可能、彼此相需的地方很多、互相利用的塲合也並不少、所困難的、是經濟上特別是棉製品市塲競爭、是英國惟一對頭、英國於此決不輕於讓步、日本方面也是工業界的死活問題、必出死力以相爭的事件、然則然們彼此間是充分含著矛看的、設使任其自然、使這種矛看擴大下去、則美日兩國間的政治諒解、是會化爲島有的、在軍縮會議的前夜、日本當然特別警戒、這絻以「門戶開放」餌英國、求經濟上一時的利益、以交換海軍軍備縮小會議的政治諒解、海軍平等要求如得到英國的同意、則日本主張是可以說下去的、</p>
<p>美國之反對是當然中的當然、不過這在英日諒解之後、會議席上形勢就不同了、假若日本提案成立、則平等原則確定、不是英美縮減現在實力、就是日本擴張軍備、這正合於軍事上的要求、於他有利、否則會議破裂、照日本的願望、恰是美國目破責任、將來發生軍備競爭、也好像由美國開端、無論在國際外交、對國內民衆、他都可以巧詞說明、鑄就他武力開拓的企劃、（十月二十五日於東京）</p>

<h3>光華與俄油改訂合同</h3>
<p>取消經理制改爲購售制</p>
<p>昨聞本埠光華火油公司與俄言有改訂合同之說、本報記者、往詢光華負責人、其答復情形如左、</p>
<p>經營狀況</p>
<p>光華於民國十八年、開始營業、係購售美油、蒙國人贊助、故營業甚佳、民國二十年俄油到滬、光華爲求避免競爭起見、於八月廿五日與其商訂經理合同、由二十一年一月開始實行、二十二年各油公司發生誤會、油價步跌、各有損失、但吾國用戶因價格低廉、大受競爭之益、在光華則因經理制祇賺傭金、故不受油價跌落之損失、雖進益較少、但無虧折、今春以來、各油公司推誠恊商、互謀讓步、油價逐漸回復、俄方亦無獨佔市塲之意、遂允光華之請、於八月廿五日取消經理合同、改訂購油合同、此後營業、完全由光華獨立負責、恢復民國二十年之制度、此近日之實在情形也、</p>
<p>本人感想</p>
<p>至本人對於此次油價競爭、得三種感想、（一）英美各油公司與蘇油所不惜重大犠牲、爲市塲之競爭、其精神實有足多、（二）蘇俄與中國、甫在恢復通商之際、亦能犠牲鉅大之損失、與英美各油公司競爭、而所爭得之市塲、即給與我華商之經理人經營、其對於經商之偉大精神、亦實可敬、（三）中國銀行界近年來對於實業之扶助、已日見注重、即如光華方面、近二年來、雖在油價競爭時期、而各銀行均能對之信任、予以有力之扶助、其維護實業之心、實爲難得、至以後火油事業之經營、已較前不易、一因關稅較前爲重、二因無稅之土油、充斥市面之故、如官廳對於土油不加禁止、則各油公司之銷數、均有縮減之虞、而對於政府關稅之收入、亦殊有影響云、</p>

<h3>東北之土地人口</h3>
<p>— 張梓生</p>
<p>—答方秋葦先生評申報年鑑—</p>
<p>方秋葦先生在最近出版的「前途雜誌上評申報年鑑，文前標明是「爲東北在中國之地位一質張其昀」的。我雖是申報年鑑的主編人·對於直接向撰述者質問的批評·本可不必代答，不過，我在張其昀先生那篇文章的題下，既註著一…原錄數字有與本社最近調查牴牾者，則酌爲改易一的數語，而關於東北土地人口的數字，又正是由我酌爲改易及審慎檢核過的；所以，方先生對那篇文章所指的「特別是東北土地人口之錯誤」一端，應由我來負責答復、—全部的質問當然由張其昀先生作答。</p>
<p>一·東北之土地面積</p>
<p>張其昀先生原稿，關於東北土地面積的數字，是用「哩作單位而另有一個數目的。我因爲申報年鑑的土地面積表，已同幾位地理學者商定，採用曾世英先生所精確推算的數字作標準；爲求全書統一計，改爲「全中國之面積爲一千一百十七萬三千五百五十八公方里，東北四省面積爲一百二十八萬五千零七十五公方里。」在曾先生的「全國各省區面積表」未曾被修正以前，中報年鑑的東北四省面積數字，我不能承認爲「大錯」。方先生既然把書上明日印著的全國數字與東北四省數字看錯了，又誤用「東北年鑑」上四省民政廳報告的華方里數字來相比，自不免覺得一相差之巨，實不能以道里計一。請細的讀者，倘一看二十三年申報年鑑卷首那篇文章的字句，再注意公方里與華方里的換算，對於「東北土地有多大一的問題，自然可以知道了」。</p>
<p>二·東北之人口數</p>
<p>關於東北四省人口數，第一次申報年鑑（二十二年版）的人口編，是的採一東北年鑑及亞新地學社的數字的；第二次（二十三年版）則改用二十二年九月的駐外領事報告—共計三千零九十二萬九千人·見二十三年申報年鑑一六九頁。張其昀先生原稿的三千五百萬人·我起初亦想改易·後來因爲計算百分值的關係，通函商榷，張先生據所著，「東北失地之經濟概況」第六至第九頁的文字見復，以爲毋須改動。我細閱該書。覺得這數目亦自有根據，遂仍其舊。方先生文中所行的各統計數字，該書在討論東北人口數時多用作資料；而且兩次的申報年鑑中都刋列過。我所以不將張其昀先生的數字修改，是樅閱「東北失地之經濟概況」一書後的結果；起初也是同方先生一樣，曾直覺地認這數字爲「亦將發生錯誤無欵」的。</p>
<p>三·申報年鑑歡迎批評</p>
<p>我上面雖然對方先生所批評的兩點，加以釋明；但我對方先生希望申報年鑑改善的熱誠，是非常欽感的。—批評是編輯人的明鏡，申報年鑑在謀逐漸向精確之途進行中·需要批評家的指導，才需要具體的切實指示的批評。</p>
<p>誠如方先生在五月二十二日世界日報「介紹申報年鑑」時所說，編輯年鑑是一件最困難的事。」申報年鑑社同人兩年來雖然竭其心力鄭重從事，遍求援助，但兩次成書以後，經批評家的指示及自已的檢閱，終不免發見若干的缺陷和錯誤。我知道，要在各種正確的材料不易獲得的中國，編成一　能使人滿意的普通年鑑，是非得全國專家學者的贊助不可的。現在第三次申報年鑑正著手修編、希望著自愛護名、在積極方面不吝供給材料、以充實內。：在消極方面以切實批評的文字見寄，俾作改編的參考。</p>

<p>大夏大學十周年紀念特刋</p>
<p>— 王伯羣題</p>
<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 王伯羣</p>
<p>語云：「生於憂患，死於安樂。」個人之生命如是，團體之生命又何莫不然。維吾大夏，誕生於民國十三年六月。初·廈門大學學生三百餘人，因當局之措施失宜，無法挽回，乃相率離校來滬，請求前廈大敎授歐元懷王毓祥傳式說等九人爲之建立新校，以爲繼續求學之所。而諸敎授咸能當仁不讓，本師生合作之初衷，開始籌備新校，並命名爲大夏大學，以誌校史嬗蛻之所自；此種奮門犧牲之精神，寗不難能可貴？惟開辦伊始，經濟籌措，備感艱困，以是一切設施，均因陋就簡，覊跡不堪。當時學生人數祇二百餘人；於小沙渡路租用校舍三樓三底，所有課堂辦公廳實騐室均在其中，狹隘情形，狹隘情形，幾非言語所能形容於萬一！然吾大夏師生，卒能本苦幹苦敎苦讀之精神，邁往直前，與而不舍。至於今日，校務進展，一日千里。梵王渡畔，廣地千頃，疊宇巍峨，氣象一新。全體敎職員學生，數逾二千。歷屆畢業生之服務社會者，尤能自強不息，克有表見。凡此皆十年來憂患艱苦中奮門之結果，而爲吾人所堪引以自慰者也。</p>
<p>雖然，大學敎育，厥任至鉅。吾大夏既以光大華夏爲已任，所負使命，尤爲隆崇！，若不確立中心之目標，行見閉門造車，必難合轍。蓋中華民族，自海禁開放以還，彼歐美帝國主義者競挾其物質文明之勢力，深入中土。侵佔我土地，侵害我主權，魚肉我人民，榨取我經濟；同時復勾結我國內軍人，循環內亂，擾攘不已。寢假而陷我民族於次殖民地之列！際茲外侮萬臻國亡無日之會，若不喚醒民族意識，發揚民族精神，其將何以振衰而起廢？大學爲最高學術研究機關，茍再沓沓泄泄，踏常習故，更何濟乎時艱！本校外審世界潮流，內察社會環境，深覺中國現階段之大學敎育，應以復與民族爲至高之原。則在此原則下，吾人努力之動向，可分爲四：（一）厲行人格敎育以陶治健全之國民道德。（二）提倡生產敎育以救濟垂危之國民經濟。（三）獎勵科學敎育以發展無限之自然寶藏。（四）實施國防敎育以培養民族之自衛能力。誠能本此鵠的，貫澈始終，則國民自信力既經確立，物質建設力漸臻充實，然後整個民族之生命，乃能脫離帝國主義者之覊絆，而兀立於適者生存之天地間。本校復與民族敎育之實施，其義蓋在於斯。</p>
<p>今日爲本校十週年紀念之期，全校師生，緬懷當年締造之艱辛，默察未來使命之鉅大，除由本校大夏學報社週報社各發特刋以誌慶祝外，復假各報發行紀念特刋一紙，列舉本校過去歷史之發展以及今後改進之計畫，以告國人，兼以自勵。承林主席各院部長官暨諸校董或錫題字，或惠鴻文，增光篇幅，良用感慰。所望全體師生，貫澈向來苦幹苦敎苦讀之精神，認定當前民族國家社會之危機，發揚蹈礍，自強不息！同時尤望國內賢豪，對我甫滿十齡之大夏孩童，繼續予以指示與提攜，俾得實現挽救國難光大華夏之使命。我大夏之幸，亦民族國家前途之幸也。</p>

<h3>大夏大學十週年紀念弘我諸夏</h3>

<h3>大夏大學新校風之造成</h3>
<p>— 何應欽</p>
<p>近來我們常常聽到一種失望的呼聲，說中國的學校敎育要破產了。這句話驟然聽來，似乎屬于神經過敏的；但要是把這幾年來學校敎育的事實和成績細味起來，倒覺主之成理。我們中國的學風有一部分真是太壞了，而且這種壞學風，還有日甚一日的趨勢。這一部分的壞學風，大都是五四運動以後漸漸形成的。五四運動是民族意義的一種醒覺運動，是當時青年學生的光榮產物。但當時青年，只有理想，沒有理想的根據。他們追求著新，熱烈地崇慕著西方的新文化，卻忘記了新文化是舊文化中產生出來的，竟把我們中國固有的文化一切都拋棄。在這一種幾乎盲目的狂熱中，他們又只把西方新文化的糟粃盡清的吸收。人性就惡易，就善難。青年恣意妄爲，學風日見囂張，而學校的管理卻日漸放鬆。近年來，許多學校裹的青年，整天的在那裹尋快樂，簡直不知研究學問修養道德爲何事；甚至有一小部份還在那裹呼口號，貼標語，甘爲一二敎育界的或政界的不肖分子所利用，作罷課鬧風潮的兵將。學風之惡劣，莫此爲甚了。</p>
<h3>大夏大學十周紀念樹木山　　乙樹</h3>
<p>— 吳敬　　祝</p>
<p>我們的大夏大學是從艱難辛苦中奮門成功的。我們立校的目的，原是訊書運動。十年來職員苦幹敎員苦敎學生苦學，一種樸實耐勞碈礪學行的校風早已養成。去年十月又決定以民族復興爲以後本大學敎育總目標，對於發揚吾國固有文化列爲實施綱要之首端。這種從五四運動遺下來之偏激忘本的青年心理當可一掃而空。可是處在空前的國難期間，我們要復興民族，我們必得列舉幾個具體的目標，更進一步的切實地養成我們的新校風。這樣，才可負起時代的艱鉅，發揚我們的大夏立校精神。</p>
<p>一·要養成爲國家爲民族犧牲的精神</p>
<p>我們國家的衰弱，由於多數國人自私自利之心太重，缺乏民族國家的觀念。凡有利於個人的，不惜犧牲一切以求之；僅利於民族國家而不利於個人的，則不但漠然無動於中，甚且多方設法以破壞之。我們的大夏大學是從犧牲精神造成的。此後更應把這種犧牲精神擴大到民族國家方面去。務使青年學生應除自私自利的劣根性，激發其愛謹民族愛護國家的思想，祇知有四萬萬人精誠團結的大我，而不知有渺乎其微的小我；若遇國家危難的時候，人人均有犧牲小我挽救大我的決心。</p>
<p>二·要嚴厲的使師生個個負起責任來</p>
<p>敎師負指導敎訓的責任，學生負勤苦研讀的責任，這是當然的道理。不過有些學校裹，敎師只求得過且過，茍且從事，聽鐘，上課聽鐘下課就算盡了責任，甚或取媚學生，以求飯碗之牢固，有的認做敎員爲迫不得已的過渡辦法；學生則多以換文憑求資格爲目的，不肯研究學問只事驕惰奢縱結黨立派爲作惡的張本。我們的大夏大學苦敎苦學之風浸潤已深，此後更應慎重遴選能澈底負責的敎員，而不應徒以資格爲標準；對于學生的功課與德行應絕對嚴格的施以管理。我們要知道學生時代決不是講自由的時代，在國難這樣嚴重的現在，我們誰也沒有個人的自由，尤其學生不應自由。我們大夏的學生應自動的負起學生的責任來，以工作的代價來換取自由。</p>

<p>在多數學校裹面，敎員和學生形成兩個不相往來的壁壘。敎員敎了一年書，還認不得幾個學生的姓名；學生聽了一年課，卻從沒和敎師談過一次話。這一來，敎員在敎學上的效率和學生在修學上的受益。只限于短短的幾個鐘點裹，下了課後，師生關係便算完結。這種隔閡的結果，還可以使學生對學業感覺枯燥單調，因而茍且怠惰。我們大夏大學的立校旗幟原是師生合作；現在風行全國的導師制又是我們大夏大學首先倡導。此後更應加緊合作，推進導師制，使師生兩方的感情和思想進一步接近起來，敎師切實訓導，學生誠意接受。</p>
<p>四·著實的注意普及體育和軍事訓練</p>
<p>我們中國人素來是不講究身體的健康的，故有東亞病夫之譏。讀書人且認文弱是書生的本色。現在我們雖已覺司身體健康的重要，要從講究衛生從事運動著乎。可是學校裹的體育課程大都是等於虛設。就是有幾個學校以體育著名的，也不過是以競技比武爲體育的全部，養成選手爲唯一的目的。至於軍事訓練則更是奉行故事，連少爺兵都養不起來。我們的大夏大學本學期起已實施普及體育，對於軍訓尤注意到實際的軍隊生活。此後更應全體總動員，施以嚴格之紀律化的訓練，務使個個學生有健全的體格，活潑的精神，刻苦耐勞的習慣，奉公守法的風尚。</p>
<p>五·使學生生活與社會生活適應起來</p>
<p>學校與社會的相距懸殊，這是我國的敎育最大缺憾之一。敎育目的原是在造成能自立而子社會有用的入；學校與社會如果是兩個截然不同的階段，一個從學校出來的青年驟然跳進社會裹，怎能應用自已？現在的學校有不少的是在製造以下兩種人：第一種是幻想家，他們抱著過於龐大的理想，對於實際社會的認識和修養絕對不足；第二種是高等遊民，他們連空想幻想的能力都沒有，他們只管吃的講究，穿的摩登，住的舒適，在校外則逛茶樓酒館，甚至跑到跳舞塲去跳舞，他們茫然不知校門外還有個完全不同的大社會之存在——在這大社會裹是要用絕大的勞力去爭得生活權利的。我們試想這兩種人，跑到社會裹去，還不是要做寄生蟲嗎？現在「畢業即失業」的聲浪已甚囂塵上，實則這種「畢業即失業」的原因，最重要的就是學校未能訓練適應社會的人材。「高不成，低不就，」唯有空喊失業罷了。我們的大夏大學早已創設民衆敎育實騐區，使學生跑到農村裹去服務。此後應更進一步使學生生活農民化，與實際的社會生活適應起來。</p>
<p>我們大夏大學的全體師生們！我們應有絕大的覺悟與決心，事事以民族國家爲前提，犧牲個人的自由，去謀大多數人的自由；並且在我們固有的文化與美德的根基上，求新的開展與創造。我們勤苦耐勞的民族精神，孝弟忠信禮義廉恥的舊道德，是我們中國民族立國之本，是我們中國民族創有四千年光榮歷史之原因。我們應跟著祖先們經過的康莊大道，剛勇的自信的邁進！同時我們更應貫澈我們大夏大學的立校精神，埋頭苦幹，埋頭苦敎，埋頭苦學，造成一種新的校風，朝夕惕厲，爲復與民族促成世界大同之準備。</p>

<h3>大夏大學與民族復興敎育</h3>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>大夏大學創辦於民國十三年，今已十易寒暑。王校長以予恭居校董之一，來函徵文，用資紀念。余維大夏在十年至短歷史中，由築路藍纔之新校，進而與國內各著名大學並駕齊驅，其發皇矞麗之進展，豈可無一言以慶祝哉？且丁茲民族垂危文化衰微之會，大夏深感爲國作人使命之隆崇，一秉其向來敎育救國之主旨，自去年秋起，定民族復興爲敎育這中心目標。茲事攸關國有民族前途，至重且大，洵有詳予探討之必要，爰華斯文，期與國人一商榷焉。</p>
<p>居茲二十世紀之國際舞臺上，有一光芒萬丈順之則生逆之則亡之現象，即爲民族文化之發展。蓋所謂文化者，乃一民族之生命力與爭存刀之表現。就其「體」而觀之，則爲一民族應付環境改善社會努力奮門所獲得物質與精神之總成績。就其「用」而言之，則又爲任何民族求生圖存繁榮發展所不能須臾或離之生活素。遠稽史乘，近察世變，古往今來，一切民旗興衰之由，強弱優劣之判，莫不以其文化之盛衰爲總因緣。</p>
<p>吾中華民旗宅居亞洲大陸，自古爲禮義文化之邦，有悠久光榮之歷史，其間雖幾經異族蹂躪，而卒能屹然保持偉大之勢力不爲所化；反之，凡侵略吾國之異族，皆卒爲我所同化。此無他，蓋吾中華民族之優秀文化有以致之耳。夷考中華民族之文化，以精神言；「至大至剛，至中至正」，「聰明睿知，足以有臨也，寛裕溫柔，足以有容也，發強剛毅，足以有執也，齊壯中正，足以有敬也，文理密察，足以有別也」。故能縱橫數萬里，上下嵊千年，發揮天賦之智能，應付繁雜之環境，正心修身，格物致知，至於物質文明，當世界草昧，洪荒未間，獉獉狉狉，人猶獸行，而我則有巢氏敎民造屋，燧人氏敎民火食，伏義氏結綱罟敎漁佃，神農氏作耕耜敎稼種，黃帝作舟車造宮室，夏禹治洪水利民生，遂開吾國社會進化之端，而登庶民於袵席之上。尤有一足以誇耀於世界者，如印刷版火藥及指南針之發明，非特係本國古代文化之先，且於元帝輸入歐洲時，竟爲促進泰西文化之原動力，諸如此類，史不勝書，此僅其較著者而已。</p>
<h3>大夏大學十周紀念為國育才</h3>
<p>— 孫科題</p>
<p>不幸自漢以後，學者主守斥進，偏重訓詁章句；晉魏六朝，更倡黃老清談之風，造成極端浪漫主義之頹敗性。及後，唐尚註疏，宋尚性理，明尚制義，清尚考證，百家思想既被壓抑，格物主義尤遭鄙棄，遂將吾民族固有創造文化之能力完全消失，而吾民族之科學藝術生活方式以及組織國家管治社會能力，亦均呈衰落之現象。泊乎近代，談玄幽默，益趨空虛，腐敗頹廢，民志日卑，不知保守，不能創造，舉國皇皇，覺前途之無望，消極萎應，造成愶力之社會。此中原因，複雜不一，而主要由於民族自信心輿物質創造力衰弱之所致。今爲力矯弊端以復興民族國家計，乃有文化復興之運動。所謂文化復興運動，即在增強吾中華民族之自信心與創造力，認識過去民族光榮之歷史，以發揮光大同有之優秀文化；同時把握國際風雲險惡生存競爭激烈之現時代階叚，努力研究物質科學，以顧及時空之需要而求適應，並建樹一新文化體系，蔣以完成民族復興之偉大使命。</p>
<h3>大夏大學十週年紀念　任重道遠</h3>
<p>— 王世杰題</p>
<p>復興民族建設文化之道，固不止一端，而文化之創造，國粹之保存，智慧之啓發。體格之鍜鋉，人格之陶治，民氣之發揚，均賴敎育爲洪鈞之鎖鑰。尤其大學敎育，爲業育人才研究學術之最高機關，負有孕育思潮發展文化，使中華民族適應時空間以繼續生存之使命。當此民族復興運動之際，今後大學敎育之設施，應如何確定方針，而後可以紓展國難、宏濟時艱，斯吾人當深切體認而研究者也。茲請論之：</p>
<p>一·涵濡創造精神</p>
<p>吾中華民族在千百年前，本富創造文化之精神，前既已言之矣。乃自新敎育施行後，從事模放，以效法他人爲光榮。殊不知一民族之文化，有賴乎其自已之創造與建設，斷不能取他人之現成物，以爲我用也。今後大學敎育之研究科學，亟宜分析民族固有之文化，而瞭解其特性以及缺點所在，根據現代社會之需要，對於本質價值，加以精密之評詁，進而創造吾中華民族特殊之文化。如何改善生活方法，如何確定社會組織，如何促進文化發展，如何從事國家建設，均宜逐一以鄉土敎材爲原質，以中國現狀爲對象。庶使民族遺產之文化，社會公器之學術，得以發揚光大而創造改進之，科學建設賴以有成，民族復興，亦不至踏空矣。</p>
<p>二·培植科學技能</p>
<p>大學敎育之目標，在訓練專門智能，改善現實生活，初非僅爲一已釣名沽譽之具也。乃吾民族因受數千年傳統思想之束縛，敎育重心，夙偏重於精神之陶治，而鮮講厚生之治術。自新敎育施行後，此種觀念尚在流行。學校課程設備，多與實際生活相悖。學生在校求學，祇知背誦書本，毫無真知實學，故往往一旦卒業於學校，轍失業於社會。今後大學敎育之設施，宜多注重科學技能之訓練，與其講空洞之學理，不如應實際需求，與其唱浮泛之高調，不如作切當之實騐。務使青年學生生活，一反過去風花雪月之病態，而合於勤勞操作之準則，手腦並用，知行合一。如是，職業之技能既備，生活保障自固，而國家社會之基礎亦可日趨安定，農工商業亦得次第發達矣。</p>
<h3>大夏十週年紀念衆志成城</h3>
<p>— 何應欽敬題</p>
<p>三·研究國防建設</p>
<p>太平洋風雲日形緊急，世界經濟狂潮益趨激烈，一旦戰事爆發，吾東亞病夫勢必首當其衝。今茍不綢繆未雨，注重國防建設，其將何以獨立而圖存耶？夫國防建設，涵義至廣。分別言之；則在目前應爲如何振興實業增加生產？在最近之將來應爲如何充實軍用科學收復失地？在較遠之將來應爲如何開闢邊疆實現太平洋上主人翁之地位？此項工作，一方面固須依賴政府整盤規劃，統制全國經濟與人才，另一方面尤須借重敎育力量，培植民族之英雄領袖。故居今日而言大學敎育，除努力於普通學識之灌輸，強健體魄之鍜鍊，高尚人格之陶治外，對於軍用科學，國防政策與戰時經濟等問題，務宜有澈底精密之研究，藉以培養其敏捷盡巧之技能。同時使學生深明歷史上偉大人物之遺敎，英雄志士爲國奮門之光榮事蹟，涵濡其獨立自尊之心理，堅忍不拔之毅力，敵愾同仇之志願，鞠躬盡瘁之精神。未然後可以造就爲國效命之人才，而不負非常時期敎育之主旨也。</p>
<p>以上三點，爲復興民族敎育之根本方針，而此項敎育之設施，是爲救國救民族之基礎工作，殊非大夏一校所獨負其責任。尚望有負大學敎育之責者，速從根本建設上向前能努力，本此鵠的，貫澈始終，雖不能期以速效，而國家之示來命脈胥繋乎是！</p>
<h3>大夏大學之史的發展</h3>
<p>— 王毓祥</p>
<p>一·導言</p>
<p>大夏誕生，已屆十稔。吾人念十年前創校之艱難，諸今茲二千餘師生蓄萃一堂之盛況，再觀環宇內國難之嚴重，益覺吾大夏未來所負使命之重大。際此十週紀念之大會，謹就大夏過去十年之發展，作概括之回顧，公諸邦人，兼以自勵云耳。</p>
<p>二·大夏創校之經過</p>
<p>甲·「六一」之意義民國十三年五月，屆時大學學生三百　人，因當局者之措施無狀，羣起謀補救，未爲所諄。而一部份敎職員，竟利用機會，矇蔽校長，橫加壓迫，軒然大波，於焉以起。學生等呼籲經旬，聲嘶力竭。至六月一日㛘築部職員復率工人毒號學生繳士清，雷榮璞，孫作瑾等。全體學生，激於義慣，不得已離校，繼恐中途失學，諄遠初志。乃推舉代表何衆炎倪文亞孫亢曾施乃鑄等十四人，來滬請求前廈大敎授歐　　，王毓祥，傳式說，余澤蘭，李世瓊，林天蘭，吳毓騰，呂子方，周學章等九人，爲之籌備新校使獲讀書之所。故以後大夏，即以此轟轟烈烈之六月一日，爲創校紀念日。由是可知</p>
<p>「六一」紀念云者，實含有三種重大意義；抵抗強橫而流血犧牲一也，爲讀書運動而建設新校二也，擁護正義而師生合作三也</p>
<p>乙·「大夏」之命名，廈大學潮之成因實由一部份敎職員之地域恩想所激成。離校諸敎授，既徇學生之請，爲之籌備新校，乃假上海貝禘鏖路美仁里二十四號爲籌備處，以「大夏」爲新絞之命名，一方面誌校史嬗蛻之所自，一方面寓「光大華夏」之意義。傳云：「夫能夏必大」是則大夏大學者，大大大學也。異日追颺哈佛，媲美牛津，惟在吾全體師生之自強不息耳。</p>
<p>丙·校董會之組織新校籌備處既已成立，吳釋暉先生常冒晏來商校事，嘗言辦學伊始，當前問題，厥在如何能使學生讀書畢業，不必拘泥於學校之形式云云。語多激勵，同人等間言之下，深用感偑。乃設文，理，敎育，商，預，五科。規畫既定，即請吳穉暉，汪精衛，張君勸，王伯羣，葉楚傖，馬君武，邵力子諸先生爲校董，成立校董會，以爲學校之代表。並由王伯羣先生捐助二千元爲開辦費。當其時捉襟慘淡經營之狀況，至今思之，猶恍然在目也。</p>
<h3>十年樹木百年樹人</h3>
<p>— 居心</p>
<p>丁·批準立案之經過本校開辦之初，租定小沙渡路二○一號爲臨時校舍，屋宇之狹隘，設備之簡陋，自屬難免。惟本校爲讀書運動之產兒，師生均能本「三苦精神」——敎員苦敎，職員苦幹，學生苦讀——奮門合作，故博得社會人士之贊助不少。十四年三月，敎育部派員來校視察，認本校「敎授管理認真，學風成績俱佳，」於同年七月二十八日部令準予備案試辦。十八年春，本校銜後購定梵王渡新校址三百餘畝，物質基礎益固，四月六日，部令批準校董會立案。四月三十日敎部復派員來校視察，對本校各方面措施，均認爲滿意，乃於十八年五月十七日批令正式立案。是後吾後校益自努力，遂一躍而爲全國著名學府之一矣。</p>
<p>三·行政組織之沿革</p>
<p>本校行政制度，先後凡經四易。第一期爲委員制，第二期爲校長制，第三期復爲委員制，第四期復爲校長制。十三年立校之始，以各校董散處各地，未易集會，暫由歐元懷，王毓祥，傳式說等三敎授任執行幹事，聘任第一期敎員；開學以後，校務加繁，乃加入魯繼曾徐璋張夢麟三敎授，組織校務會議分工維持校務；至十一月二十二日乃召集第一次校董會，公推馬君武博士爲校長，王伯羣先生爲校董會主席。十六年一月馬校長因廣西大學關係，堅請辭職。當時國民政府推行委員制，本校乃更校長制爲委員訓，由校董會推王伯羣先生爲大學委員長，改校務行政委員會爲大學委員會，由委員十人組織之。十七年三月，遵照大學院頒佈學校條例，復改委員制爲校長制，由董事會公推王伯羣先生爲校長，歐元懷先生爲副校長，同時復將大學委員會改爲校務會議。迄於今茲，未有變革，行政基礎，益臻鞏固矣。</p>
<p>四·校舍之變遷</p>
<p>本校校舍，凡經三遷。在籌備時期，乃在上海法租界貝禘鏖路美仁里二四號。及開學之初，即租定小沙渡路二○一號爲臨時校舍，三樓三底，形類古廟，所有課堂辦公室實騐室圖書室，均在其中，宿舍在勞勃生路致和里，屋前馬路，權作籃球塲。作者無以名之，曾名這爲躍踏時代。十四年夏，五卅慘案發生，英兵壓境，佔我校舍：本校乃趨避於檳擲路潘氏宗詞兩音門房內辦公：並與潘姓房東，磋商借地興建校舍，幾經周折，始得始願。秋季乃遷入膠州路三○一號校舍上課，並租定校旁空地二十餘畝爲運動塲。其後學生澈增，又於膠州路校舍對面添建宿舍一座，小課堂兩座；並在勞勃生路左旁，租地一方。建造女生宿舍。此時環境較佳，因其所有房地，多係租借而來，故曾名之曰「惜光時代」。在此「借光時代」先後遠五年之久。直至十九年狄始遷入梵王渡「大廈時代」之自建新校舍。規模宏社，校塲空聞，空氣清鮮，環境清幽，誠莘莘學子，求學之樂園也。</p>
<h3>大夏大學十周年紀念棫樸作人</h3>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>五·餘言</p>
<p>以上所述，僅就吾大夏剙絞之經過，行政組織之沿革，與夫校舍變遷之大略情，擇要報告；其他各部處之重要發展與改進，尚有專文敘述，茲不另贅。但古語有云：「憂勞可以興國，逸豫可以亡身」。「人莫不生於憂患，死於安樂」。個人如楚，國家如是，團體亦如是。前事不忘，後事之師。吾人追憶主，瞻望來茲，感吾國民族復興之危殆，益自策勵。二十二年冬，訂定實施民族復興敎育綱要，期以三年，以爲全校師生努力之中心目標。易示：「其亡其亡擊於苞桑」。當茲國難嚴重千鈞一髪之際，苞桑之繋，誰爲綱維？吾大夏奮門犠牲與創造之精神未始非吾民族救亡圖存之疆珠也。</p>

<h3>大夏大學今後發展方針</h3>
<p>— 歐元懷</p>
<p>師生合作慘淡經營之大夏大學，今已忽忽誕生十載矣。其其社會國家之貢獻，識者自有公評，無待贅言。惟回顧十年之間，外仗社會人士維護贊助，內賴全校師生之努力奮門，校務進展一日千里。學生人數，隨歲激增，由二百而遠二千；校址五經遷徒，而規模益臻宏大，由足無立錐之地，而至自置校地三百畝；校舍由矮屋數橡而至廣廈連雲；一千五百畢業生服務國內各省市及南洋羣島，留學外國者百餘人，成績斐然，在人耳目，此縱未敢引爲已達至善之鵠，要亦差強人意，而稍足告慰於愛護大夏之人士也·元懷忝列創辦人之一，且輔理校政有年，際茲十週紀念之日，對於今後發展之計劃，敢不稍爲議及？第計劃非難，實行爲難。前此許多計劃，或因財力限制，或因人才缺乏，強半未得實現。是則今日無取好高務遠，僅就目前所急須建設者略述梗概，以供關心大夏校務者之參考，同時亦爲自資警愓之南針</p>
<p>甲·關於今後施政方針</p>
<p>行政設施，貴在便利敎學。本校年來行政，固多特殊成績，而不合於理想者，仍非絕無僅有。爲今之計，即在發揮過去優長，而設法彌補其缺陋。分別言之，有下四端，應加注意實行者。</p>
<p>（一）力求行政合理化</p>
<p>對於日常行政及一切發展計劃，常用科學方法，預先廠密調查設計，訂定各部行政暦，按期施行，以求效率之提高，並實行院科務報告，藉收相互監督之效。尤以木校經濟不甚寛裕，所有行政用費，必須厲行緊縮政策，以減少無謂之消耗，直接減輕學校負擔，間接增加敎育效能。同時智·德·體·羣·美五育，以平均發展爲原則。無論何方重要設施事宜，均須妥擬計劃及說明書，提交校務會議審核，藉收集思廣益，而發揮會議制之機能。即學生方面，如有對校務改進之建議，在可能範圍內，亦宜採納</p>
<p>（二）保持苦做精神</p>
<p>本校係私立學校。私立學校之勁敵，一言以蔽之曰，經濟壓迫。然本校之誕生，是爲國家育才而努力，是爲學術建設而奮門，十年如一日，始終保持苦做精神。經費困難不足憂，環境惡劣不足懼，每遇一次危險，而此精神乃愈加其強度，卒能於驚濤駭浪中，安然渡過，此無他，苦做精神有以致之耳。今校基雖已樹立，但距吾人理想尚遠。今後全校師生，不但仍宜一秉以往犠牲奮門堅毅進取之精神，且須發揚而光大之。敎員苦敎，職員苦做，學生苦學，羣策羣力，萬矢赴的，養成「自強不息」苦幹力行之學風，大淬礪其錄芒，爲全國學校倡。將由十年，二十年，五十年，百年，以至千年，使「新出於硎」，成爲吾校永久之校訓。</p>
<h3>羣賢堂（大課堂）</h3>
<p>（三）努力師生合作</p>
<p>吾校自創辦以來，即注意意師生合作。務使全校環境，猶如家庭父子兄弟姊妹之間，師與生合作，師與師合作，生與生合作，舉凡校務之改進，意見之商洽，學術之探討，問題之解決，莫不推誠相見。無詐無虞，拋棄小我以成大我，如水乳之相融，祇見積極建議，未聞消極批評。是以校務得以兼程發展，日臻完善之城。惟大學敎育使命隆崇，將來建設方與未艾，我全體師生，允宜本「衆聲成城」之義再接再厲，永矢弗失；關於學校之現在設施，與夫今後改進之計劃，尤宜當仁不讓，在維護學校本身之原則下，貢獻所見，共策進行。然後團體生活，方能維擊於不敝，而學校前途，乃益發揮而光大。此則吾人應有之覺悟而有待更進一步之努力也</p>
<h3>羣策齋（男生宿舍之一）</h3>
<p>（四）切實聯絡社會</p>
<p>學校是社會，敎育即生活。閉門造車，出不合轍，此古人所切戒，亦今辦學者所深宜注意者也。本校過去以努力內部之整頓，微嫌與社會缺少聯絡。爲今之計，必須多方注意社會之聯絡。聯絡之道有四：（１）以實際成績表現，博得社會之同情。（２）聯絡家長。調查與訪問兼施，時將學校情形及該生在校求學狀況，以書面報告其家庭；並徵求各方面改進意見，俾收學校敎育與家庭敎育恊助之效能。（３）團結畢業同學。精密調查其在社會服務之狀況，作設施之南針；并充分利用校刋，隨時溝通校友消息，盡量介紹相當職業，指導或解決其困難問題，（４）服務社會。設社會及科學問題詢問部，並盡量利用大夏民敎實騐區設施辦法，領導附近民衆改良農作物，建設醫院馬路，以及興辦一切公益事業。同時對於社會文化及救國運動，率導學生熱烈參加，一方訓練辦事技能，他方提高服務精神。</p>
<p>乙，關於物質建設計劃</p>
<p>物質建設，尚爲吾校當今要圖。惟目前所要努力者，係繼續前此未竟之工作，完成基本之建築與設備，並非取貴族式的奢華舖張。關於此方面亦可分爲下二項：</p>
<p>（一）完成基本建築</p>
<p>吾校現有課堂宿舍，頗爲壯麗堅固。本季又新建中學校舍三座，擴充科學館一幢。梵王渡畔，氣象一新。在最近三五年內，課堂及科學實騐塲所，尚可敷用。惟以限於經濟，未另建有總辦公室，暫時附設羣賢堂樓下。邇來學生人數增加，各種研究室紛紛設立，殊覺不夠分配。至永久圖書館及雨蓋操塲，迄今尚付缺如，尤爲憾事。上項建築，關係行政效率及敎學訓練，至重且大。尚望董事會及全校師生，努力籌劃，共策進行。例以過去歷史，當不難於短期完成是項使命。</p>
<p>（二）充實各種設備</p>
<p>大學爲研究高深學術機關，非徒上課堂抄筆記，必須注重課外閱讀與試騐。惟欲從事大規模實騐研究，則本校現有圖書儀器，尚嫌不足，今後除每年指定的欵繼續擴充外，擬於最短時間舉行捐募運動。此外體育器械之增添，衛生設備之擴充，尤當積極規畫，促早實現。至本秋間承商務中華兩大書局長期寄覽各種珍貴圖書儀器標本模型，總數在五千件以上，以及敎育館史地社會研究室編製報章索引，均屬切實研究工作，而深值得擴大努力者也。</p>
<p>丙，關於敎導改進方針</p>
<p>國人常有一錯誤觀念，以爲中小學校宜多注意敎學與訓導，大學係自由研究圖地，實無須考究敎學方法，訓導更屬風馬牛不相及。流弊所至，往往敎授自敎其書，學生瞠目莫測高深，學風萎靡不振，浮躁浪相沿成習，其能自克振拔發奮勤學者，殆如風毛麟角，不可多觀。學術前途，寗復有光明希望乎！是今後敎導之改進，實爲急不容緩之圖，茲就其主要者分述焉。</p>
<p>（一）釐訂敎學方針</p>
<p>敎學貴有方針，俾便有所準繩，而不至無的放矢。本校今後應釐訂敎學方針；（１）各學科以促進民族復與爲重心，並求全課程能有系統聯絡（２）敎材組編，依鄉土主義爲出發，務求適應國情需要，而爲切合現代生活之知能。（３）利用各種優良敎學方法，實施嚴格訓練，以期增進敎育效率而提高學生程度。（四）注重健康敎育，以鍜鍊青年身心。（５）養成奮門創造精神。</p>
<p>（二）努力生產敎育</p>
<p>生產敎育，攸關國民生計之充實，農村敎化之復興，至重且大。且滬西野原廣漢，農村櫛比，其可資利用者，正復不少。本校擬最近添辦農工兩學院，本季先於敎育學院內，添設生產敎育師資訓練班，以求養成職業補習學校之師資及中小學之勞作敎員。現一切計劃及課程，均在詳細擬訂中，並經組織籌備委員會，期對生產敎育作大規模之探討，以爲復興民族之基礎工作。尚望全校師生努力策進之！</p>
<p>（三）推進普及體育</p>
<p>體格之強弱，攸關民族之興衰。而年來一般大學之通病在於專重選乎比賽，忽視大多數學生體格訓練，以致青年不喜運動，精神萎靡。吾校本季爲力行普及體育起見，將運動塲及運動設備大加擴充，規定早操及課外運動爲全校學生必修學程，依其能力性別及季節之差異，施以各殊之訓練。務使各個學生咸得適宜鍜鍊身體之機會，藉以養成健全之體格，樹立中國復興之基礎。</p>
<p>（四）實行訓敎協助</p>
<p>吾校素主訓敎協助，施行導師制遠在六年前，爲全國大學之嚆矢。數年以來，頗著成效。自本學期起，更將原定制度加以改進，所有大學各學院及師專科全體學生，依其所習之主輔系排列組次，由導師三十餘人分別擔任，切實指導。指導期間，自學生入校起至畢業止；其範圍約分自修，自治，健康，及社會服務等項；其方法除不背訓育原則及本校校訓外，得山導師自出酌定同，形式不拘：或由導師約定各生團體或個別談話，或由學生隨時提出切身問題，請敎導師。務期厲行新生活，以涵濡健全之中心思想，而爲將來服務社會國家之準備，是亦復興民族敎育之一端也。</p>
<p>（五）提振學術創造</p>
<p>吾校爲國內最高學府之一，且以訊書運動爲其產生之背景，尤宜養成學術研究之風氣，以爲一般大學之表率。今後學校方面，固宜積極擴充兩書儀器，添設各種研究室，舉行學術講座，籌增獎學基金，以求提振研究精神，激發創造心理，注重課外實騐，獎勵專題研究。而敎師對於社會學識之灌輸，科學技能之訓練，亦當加倍努力，隨時留意鑒別天才，以期造就出類拔萃之領袖人物。惟外力之推動，終不若內蘊自發之力量，最後惟一希望，是在全體同學堅定專趣，把握自信，對於特長學科，務宜以冷靜之頭腦，坦白之胸懷，犀利之眼光，靈敏之身手，爲澈底永恒之探討，中正無偏之評判。夫然後方能融會貫通，水到渠成，真知實學，顛仆不破。此種研究精神，係大學生命缐之所寄，亦即大思民家大發明家大科學家大企業家之所培植者也。</p>
<h3>圖書閱覽室之一</h3>
<p>（六）涵養健全人格</p>
<p>大學生爲社會中堅份子，負建設國家之職責，平日對於學術研究精神之培養固屬重要，而健全人格之涵濡，尤不可缺。我人細察現今社會之積弊，與一般大學生之墮落，認爲今日實施人格敎育之標的：第一在崇尚氣節，淡泊勢利。第二在實責任心，奉公守法：第三在紀律化，實行新生活：第四在勤倹化，堅苦耐勞。第五在明禮義，廉潔自重。務使青年學子及時猛省於修身克已功夫上痛下針砭，一洗過去浮躁浪漫荒嬉奢侈之惡習，培養優美醇樸之學風，樹立整潔健康之生活，保持互助協作之精神，明辦義利，認定是非，碈礪志氣，堅守節操，造次必如是，顛沛必如是，朝斯夕斯　，一不茍且，所以進德敦品者在此，所以建設功立業者亦在此！</p>
<p>語云：「共患難易，同安樂難」。吾校發展於茲，雖未可言已臻「安樂」之域，添確進入「小康」途徑矣。至盼全體師生，時念「風雨如晦，鷄鳴不已」古詩，互以「自強不息」相警勉，百尺竿頭，更進一步，誠識過去之光榮，希望將來之進展，努力讀書運動，培植領袖人才，發揚民族精神，以完成大學敎育之使命。此則元懷所當服隋費失，而亦有待於全校師生之黽勉以赴者也。</p>
<h3>大夏大學普及導師制之實施</h3>
<p>— 魯繼曾</p>
<p>一·導師制之意義</p>
<p>導師制之旨趣在使師生間之關係合理化。我國今日敎育之所以不振，學校師生間之不良關係實爲厲階。今欲挽此狂漍，必須自創造敎育新倫理始。導師制特爲此種創造之嘗試耳。</p>
<p>學風之良窳，全校員生應共負其責。學潮之起伏無常，原因雖極復雜，但敎員與學生之間先有一種反常狀態，固爲信而有徵之說。師不師，生不生，乃爲醖釀學潮之主因。</p>
<h3>化學實騐室之一</h3>
<p>韓文公之師說曰：「師者所以傳道授業解惑也」。能勝此任者方可謂爲名導師。因導師實蘊「敎師」「益友」與「指導者」三種意義。古人以訪師間友爲立身之要圖。今之爲學生者欲獲良師則必須先有尊師重道之赤誠；欲得益友，則必須先有信義忠貞之懷抱；欲求有卓識之指導者，則必須先有浸潤真理，力謀精進之熱忱。導師對於此等學生當與切磋學間以啓迪其智慧，當與碈礪道德以培植其人格，並當協謀建設事業之肇劃以鼓舞其從事於職業之勇氣與壯志也。</p>
<p>復興民族之敎育必須於課堂講授之外補充以人格敎育及職業指導，始能盡學校之職能。今導師以其師長之資格授予學生以切要之知識，以其益友之身份陶鎔學生之情感，並以指導者之地位，培植學生之志氣，俾學生之智仁勇均臻上乘而其知情意亦盡納於軋物之中焉。倘學生爲可造之材而非自甘暴棄者，則此種敎育不特能媲美盧梭之愛彌兒，並將爲民族復興之肇基也。茲更以簡圖說明鄙意如左：</p>
<p>二·本校實施導師制之經過</p>
<p>本校自民國十三年創校以來，即富於導師制之真正精神。師生本風雨同舟之情誼萬衆一心努力於讀書運動以建立此嶄新之學府。本校師生合作之光榮，久已成爲中外敎育史乘之佳話。本校之行導師制，以時期而言，可分爲下列四個時期；一日有實無名時期，亦可謂肇端時期，即民國十三年秋至民十六秋之三稔。在此時期中央敎授皆富於導師之精神，學生皆富於願於承敎之志趣，故全校不特充滿曩昔書院之遣見，並有學校家庭之實效。二日革創時期，即自民十六秋至民廿一秋也。於此五年之中嶷吾校全體師生之苦心孤詣，導師之制，綱目井然。但吾儕當時尚不敢自信爲盡妥善，故採取實騐態度，僅在本科四年級及師專科二年級之將屆畢業學生中試行之。三曰擴充時期，即自民廿一秋至廿三秋也。於此兩年中乃本吾人從經騐得來之勇氣，除本科及師專之特屆畢業班學生外，並加以本科一年級全體學生及心科，一年級之新生。被指導之學生較前激增數倍，而導師之人數亦隨之大爲增加。四曰普及時期。即自本學期始也。總之導師制之在吾校足有十年之歷史。吾輩視之不啻爲一吾輩乎植之樹，已屆含葩欲放之期。茲更以簡圖說明導師制在吾校之遲嬗。</p>
<p>第一時期—孕育時期—民十三秋至民十六秋—試行於本科及師忖將屆畢業學生</p>
<p>第三時期—擴充時間—民廿一秋至民廿三秋—加入本科及師專一年級全體新生</p>
<p>第四時期—普及時期—自本學期開始普及於全校學生</p>
<p>三·本學期施行普及導師制之概況</p>
<p>施行普及導師制既爲吾校民族復興敎育之要項，故其起意實遠在去歲秋季。經過民族復興敎育委員會之精密擘劃，並經全校校務會議更番研討，然後於第一百六十次校務會議通過其條例凡九條。復於第一百六十一次校務會議通過其施行細則凡十一條。故此次所定導師制之章則，非倉卒爭急就，實乃斟酌已往之經騐，現在之需要，以及將來之動向，所慎重規劃者。其施行之範圍則由局部而普及於學生全體導師之選擇，則由本校視學生這科系而聘請與其所學有密切關係之敎授充任之；而指導之時期則自入學起至出校止均屬同一導師，中途不得更變。並於每月中舉行導師會議一次，報告各人指導之經過，並討論關於指導方面之一切問題。現由本校聘定之導師，計有三十三人，每人所指導之學生由三十人至五十人不等。開始指導以來殊形活躍。試申論之，今日之方法較之向者之優點甚多：一日，施行之普遍化。各級學生均得享愛導師指導之利益，非僅限於最高年級或最低年級，而使其他年級學生抱向隅之憾也。二日便利於學術之研究，凡指定之導師均與學生所選定之科系有密切之關係；彼此聲同道合，受指導者固可朝夕請益，擷精取華。作登峰造極之企圖；而爲導師者亦可展其所長，盡力指導，平素孜孜矻矻所獲之心得而蘊積於陶者，因此傳受有人，於是學術方面日見昌明，光彩煥發。否則以與學生所研究者無密切關係之敎授爲其導師，以志趣不同，學生即欲作進一步之研究，難免有南轅北轍之苦也。三日，切合於生活之指導。夫導師對於學生之指導，除口授筆述外，尤爲重大者，厥爲導師以及個大之人格，啓沃於學生，使其於不知不覺中，得有優良之誘導，自能納於軌物之內。若導師頻頻更易，指導之時期甚暫，學生對於導師猶不能有深切之認識，何能得優良之暗示，而生美滿之反映乎！反之導師對於學生，亦須有長期明晰之觀察，而後始能有正確允當之指導，此亦絕非短促之指導時期所可希冀者。今本校規定學生，自入學時起至出校止皆從同一導師，則學生在校數年中與導師朝夕磋廟，感情日洽，不僅導師對於學生能有明晰之觀察而予以正確之指導，即學生亦得受導師人格之陶鎔，如沐時雨，如坐春風，於不知不覺中誘掖而成爲優美之人才，此其收效之宏，可斷言也。</p>
<h3>羣英齋（女生宿舍）</h3>
<h3>大夏中學建築新校舍的經過</h3>
<p>— 倪文亞</p>
<p>本校創辦於民國十四年秋天，那時大夏大學成立才一年。在整個大夏的基礎尚未穩定之下，本校的情形也就可想而知了。最初的課室是檳榔路的潘氏宗祠，最的宿舍小沙渡路二○一號。第二年秋天租新加坡路十五號爲校舍。十六年春天，滬上英兵雲集，校舍突被佔住；不得已又遷回小沙渡路二○一號。同年秋天，並遷入膠州躍州路大學校舍內，所以節開支也。十七年春天，租戈登路八十八號爲校會；秋天，並租戈登路一百三十一號爲第二院。十九年秋天，大不部以中山路新校舍落成，於是膠州路原有校舍全部由本校接收應用。二十一年一二八之後，大學部又遷回膠州路；大中二部同處半年。那年秋天起，本校乃遷入中山路大學校舍——以原禮堂改做大中二部總辦公處，羣賢堂一部份爲本校敎室，男女生則分住羣力羣英二齋，如是者凡二年。</p>
<p>原來大學的附中有爲普通中學不可及者：第一，有機會利用大學的圖書儀器等設備。第二，課外得到學識的機會比較的多。第三，容易引起研究學術的志願，原來不努力求學的學生也勤學了。第四，升學可以免入於自已興趣能力不合的院系，而升學等於升級。第五，個人和團體接觸的關係比較的多，將來服務社會時可以多得互助合作的機會。但是，只可利用這比較濃厚的學術空氣，誘掖並增加中學學生求學的志願和機會。至於知識的探求和指導的方法，卻必須富有中等敎育的色彩；而一切的學生生活，尤必須合於中學生生活的規範。這個原則，是一切大學的附設中學的成敗的分水缐。把握不住這個原則，則大學附中的好處固無從得到，而普通中學所沒有的壞處卻有了。倘要把握這個原則，固有待於中學敎職人員的努力；但是敎學訓導和校舍設備是息息相關的。沒有精神空有形式固然不好，但沒有形式而專希望精神，事實上也是很難。比如說，在混合的食堂，宿舍，休息所，敎室所在處，以及同一的作息時間，中學的色彩是很難鼓舞的。在大中學生雜處的校舍，施行別乎大學的中學生生活指導，至少是事倍功半。本校在二十一年暑期以前的校舍遷移情形，很像一幅流民國。從二十一年秋天起，總希望自成單位的中學校舍早日實現，那才有利無弊了。</p>
<h3>圖書館</h3>
<p>本年春間，這種理想漸形具體化。乃由本校高中土木工程科主任柳士莫先生繪就新校舍圖樣，由本校畢業生覺川記營造廠包工，由本校高中土木科本屆畢業生章性可等二君監工。於五月初動工，經四個多月至九月初始全部落成。計辦公處一幢，樓下分設中學主任室，敎導處，總辦公處，敎員休息室，接待室及會議室等；樓上置大書庫一，閱覽室一，可容學生百餘人。課室二幢，計普通敎室十六，理化敎室一，勞作敎室一，並體育部及童子軍團部各一間。新校舍北首並闢爲早操塲，及各項疎類運動塲。男女學生仍分住羣力羣英二齋，而與大學設法隔離。</p>
<h3>大夏中學新校舍（敎室之一）</h3>
<p>本校自十四年成立以來，論年度恰交十年。此十年中國家所遭遇之內憂外患，使全民族在心理上與生活上均感極度的搖撼。本校獨得社會人士之熱烈贊助，校內師生之和衷共濟，使精神物質均得相當的進步。深望全體同仁，全體學生，體念過去的不易，共同努力，實現更光榮的將來！</p>

<h3>鄧氏推鉛球姿勢（葉長烈攝）</h3>
<p>未盡所長</p>
<p>昨日四選手、俱略爲小試其技而已、且倒串項目、並未用盡其力、所跑者除克勞萊外、皆非所長、如克銀漢爲一千五百公尺及一英里創世界新紀錄者、</p>
<p>昨日跑四百公尺及八百公尺、格林爲四百公尺好乎、昨日則跑百公尺及二百公尺、且克銀漢適患傷風癥、抱恙登塲、蓋盛情不可卻也、克勞萊爲三千公尺創世界新紀錄者、鄧氏爲鐵球鐵餅好乎、以無人與之競爭、紀錄亦未曾特出也、</p>

<h3>大夏大學今晨十週紀念</h3>
<p>勵行苦辦苦敎苦學精神</p>
<p>今後以民族復興敎育爲總目標</p>
<p>大夏大學自民國十三年秋創校以來、迄今已滿十載、該大學創校之主要目標爲讀書運動、全校師生合作、極富犠牲奮門與創造之精神、其三苦主張——職員苦辦、敎授苦敎、學生苦學、——十年來如一日、今日上午九時舉行十週年紀念典禮、爰撮述其概況、</p>
<p>史的發展</p>
<p>該大學校舍曾經數易、初僅於法租界貝締鏖路美仁里租屋一間設籌備處、繼遷至戈登路底宜昌路、三遷至小沙渡路二零一號、四遷至膠州路三零一號、迨十九年秋始遷至梵王渡中山路自建規模宏壯之新校舍、遂奠百年樹人之永久根基、該大學早經敎育部批準立案、列於國內著名大學之林、</p>
<p>現狀一瞥</p>
<p>現在該大學之校舍、宏壯美觀、均採最新式樣、計大課堂羣賢堂一座、男生宿舍羣策齋羣力齋各一座、女生宿舍羣英齋一座、科學館·圖書館·大禮堂·療養院各一座、兩設大夏中學新校舍三座、敎職員宿舍十二幢、市房·飯廳·平房·及一切附屬建築物、均敷應用、鳥瞰全校校景、有古木·有原野·有清流·各池塘·校塲空曠·空氣清魚、環境清經、孫花圖式之佈置、富自然之風景、圖書與科學之設備、均頗完備、而敎育館與民衆敎育實騐區之創辦、尤具特色、綜計全校現有大學學生一千三百人、中學學生六百人、邁步前進、正方與未艾、</p>
<p>今後方針</p>
<p>今後該大學校務進行之方針、已於去冬決定以民族復興敎育爲總目標、其努力之動向、約有四方面、（一）厲行人格敎育以陶冶健全之國民道德、（二）提倡生產敎育以救垂危之國民經濟、（三）獎勵科學敎育以開發無限之自然寶藏、（四）實施國防敎育以培養民族之自衛能力、當茲國難嚴重、千鈞一髪之際、苞桑之擊、誰爲綱維、該大學之奮門犧牲與創造之精神、未始非吾民族此後救亡圖存之驪珠也、</p>
<p>紀念典禮</p>

<h3>工部局將發給私立校第三季補助費</h3>
<p>工部局敎育委員會、日前會講時、討論衛生處對於領受補助費學校之報告、據查該報告、已將各補助學校（均華人學校）按衛生處標準、予以分級、上年六月間認爲不能滿意之學校若干校、多已遵照屬定標凖改革、惟有十二校尚未照辦、旋經委員會審護之下、除該十二校災移往界外之某校外、其他各校本年第三季之補助費、可即發放、此項議案、現已經董事會核準、又審核一九三五年請領補助費之分委員會人選、經已擬定如下、華人學校分委員會爲袁履登君、林康侯、歐元懷博士、韋捧丹博士、劉湛恩博士、廖世承博士、葛祖蘭君、曹雲祥博士、夏晉麟夫人、及楊錫珍女士、外僑學校分委員會、爲歇褒德君萊士利夫人、山本君、</p>
<h3>工部局考慮日僑改革敎育方針</h3>
<p>本埠日本僞民團體、曾向工部局建議、改變敎育方針、其大旨爲（一）廢止局立學校、（二）對各僑民團體所辦學校予以補助（三）每年補助費總額、即以今年之敎育經常費及臨時費總額爲準、（四）分配之標準、應照學童之寡或納稅人之多少定之、此議經敎育委員會提出討論、並邀請日僑代表杉本及池田二君到會、陳述意見、</p>
<p>據財務處代理處長提出報告、一九三三年度、在局立及局欵補助學校之外僑學童共六、五九一名、日人約占半數、如照該建議、將本年用於外章學校之經常臨時費、以半數補助日僑學校、則其廢將逾七十萬元、而本年實陰補助費、則只十一萬八千元、日僑方面自籌之數、約有三十二萬七千元、學費明甚經、最多者只每月五元耳、嗣由池田君陳述、謂日僑之建議、係欲求經費之分配、得其公允、但完全採納、似困難甚多、故相當之修正、亦不反對、惟局方現今之制度、欲再擴充、終非加捐不可、而無論如何、終不克使界內學童全數受敎、如此則經費之增加、終不克使界內學童全數受敎、如此則經費之增加、終將達一限度、而不可再增、何如以此經費、多劃出一部、使局校以外之學童、得受其益、蓋現今局校之設、富有之家、頗得其利、其餘十分之九、限於學費之大、不克入校、至改變方針、不妨以漸而行、先將現在所耗之建築費、移爲補助費、</p>
<p>某委員言、經費之分配、可以有數種標準、如以人口言、則本界及界外馬路、有日僑一八、四七八人、（十五歲以下者五·四三八人）其他外僑一七、九九三人、（十五歲以下者三·四九三人）中國人九七一、三九七人、（十五歲以下二五三、三八八人）若以所擔負捐額而論、則日僑占百分之七·五、其他外僑百分之五○·四、中國人百分之四二·一、究取何標準、不可不查、</p>
<p>池田君答、分配一層、是否照居民及國籍、嚴格平等定之自可由局方斟酌、但現今之敎育費預算、似已達最高之度、即使局方收入再增、亦只可以其溢額補助私立學校、以學童待遇論、日倫每生每年約費六七十元、其他外僑學童、每年每生費至四百元、大有出入、</p>
<p>委員會主席稱、局立學校學生所付之學費、係以全校開支三分之一爲準、池田君云、日僑各校、辦法不同、除日政府補助及工部局助欵外、全由日僑團體擔任、至學費一層、係調查其家長能力、酌令擔任、現在預計一九三五年、支出需五十八萬七千元、收入尚只五十三萬九千元、</p>
<p>嗣經繼續討論、釋明工部局之責任、只能爲界內居民、或納稅人之兒童、籌劃敎育、局立各校中、</p>
<p>如有法租界或華界學童、籌劃敎育、局立各校中、如有法租界或華界學童、則加收學費四分之一、但對於補助費、則不易限制之、蓋受補助之學校、顯不免收納界外或非納稅人之子弟也、</p>
<p>某委員稱、局中敎育費、近三年已增一倍、現今實占全部收入百分之八九、惟另一委員則稱、四年前所採取之敎育計盡、係屬最低限度、絕非最高限度、現今學校之應增設、其爲急需、無異於昔日、該計畫雖已略受停頓、但公衆則希望其於明年恢復進行也、至此、委員會乃宣布延會、</p>

<h3>東籬高士菊</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>趨炎附勞趕熱鬧，誰都說是萬萬要不得的人格。所以在萬花獻媚的春夏二季裹，就很難找出如何品格高貴的名花來，即使有品格高貴的，混在萬紫千紅之內，在一般品花春的眼光中，也就覺得這不過是食客三千中之一客而已。因此，在萬紫千紅，喪顏褪色的秋風裹，綻出花朶兒來的「菊」，就被稱爲「高士」。</p>
<p>「菊」之被稱爲「高士」，也不只是不趨炎附勢，不擠在食客三千中，而隨著大衆綻褪的那幾重關係。就在容貌上說，也有特異之處。普通花兒的莖葉，都有一個共同的表徵，是很豐腴的。假使肥料不足，不能致於豐腴，那麼，便不能放出美麗的花朶兒來。菊便不這樣。不施肥料，也能綻出花朶兒來。施了肥料，也不過這麼疏疏的幾莖。而且盆栽的，倒不及生長在東籬邊的多雅逸之致。這就是「山人野散慣了」的本色。</p>
<p>普通的花兒，除了木本的，倚著根深蒂固的根幹，明春還能苞萌花綻外，其餘的，經秋風一括，炎勢既退，便都萎爲枯草了。「菊不這麼。菊雖是草本，但綻過了花，依舊生存著，待明秋再萌茁清高雅淡的花來，點綴這萬分肅殺的秋色。而且菊雖綻花，不留種子，而以分枝法蕃殖，不同於普通的花奔，努力於勢力的膨脹，一朶花，可孕結著數十粒以至數百粒的種子。</p>
<p>但是在這人慾橫流的時代，不趙炎，不附勢，自甘淡泊，與世無爭的高士，已不再有人放在眼里了。因爲今之所謂高士者，名名山居養性，觀瀑聽秋，實際上都是些未能忘情於聲色犬馬，不過因暫時失意，而自命爲高士，以待時機之來臨。或以宦囊盈溢，於是退居山林，左嬌妻而右美妾，以換換空氣而已。「菊」稱高士，此輩亦稱高士，我想「菊」當不耐此一團富貴氣也。</p>
<h3>菊與陶淵明</h3>
<p>— 姚天羽</p>
<p>秋深了，東籬的菊都已開放著它的奇葩，吐著它的冷香，裝點著秋的空際，極顯得清雅美麗。</p>
<p>別的花兒都在春夏兩季里以穠冶的恣態向人們賣弄它們的風情，獨有菊在這深秋時節出現，雖經嚴酷的風霜的壓迫，它也不會屆服。這可以看出它的孤高奇拔了。</p>
<p>由於菊的孤高奮拔，而想到陶淵明。</p>
<p>他是具有一身傲骨的詩人，他的思想高超，品格卓絕，當他在「彭澤令」任上時，一天，督郵要去見他，有人勸他應束帶出拜，他傲然控說：「我不能爲了五斗米而折腰」！於是丟棄了他這個官爵，回歸他的故園去了。</p>
<p>他於別種花卉都無愛好，獨有嗜菊之癖；也許是因爲菊的品格和他的性情巧合吧？他的故園雖然荒蕪了，而他栽種著的菊花卻是纍纍滿園，他雖賦閒，他雖清苦，有了菊兒和他作伴，飮他的酒，賦他的詩，也很「怡然自得」。</p>
<p>現在的人們說起賞菊，也必以什麼「淵明癖」相標榜，其實現在的人有多少能和他一樣的具著高超的思想和卓絕的品格呢？許多的人不是拚命地在謅諛顯貴，以圖升遷，便是不惜出賣自已實貴的人格和靈魂，給別人當工具走狗，供人驅遣；這班俗惡的人們，賞菊就賞菊罷了，（可是菊如有知，也未必歡迎這班人們一「賞」吧？）何苦辱沒陶先生清高的名節呢？</p>
<h3>紅楓下蟹宴</h3>
<p>— 黃青白</p>
<p>蘆花兒老白了頭的時候，楓葉兒可醉紅了臉啦。幽然地站在柴門口，田野的風鏖把清明的景色塗上一層灰褐色，望見公路那兒黑牛似的汽車，便又勾引起懷念著朋友的情緒—「在都市裹疲倦了吧，星期日下午，我爲你們在紅楓下設下蟹宴，今年的菊花亦特別黃呢，來吧。」—</p>
<p>這樣桃色的請柬給綠衣人帶出的第五天的下午，幽矮的古時風的明瓦廳裹圍坐著六個煤煙氣息的都市人，談笑著，各個都遣忘了自已的家似的。都市人坐到紅楓下面爭辯著菊種，蟹已經在黑鐵鍋裹換上紅色的見客外衣。</p>
<p>「你們盡量地醉吧，蒞暮時光是醉的時光，我爲你們去預備密味的蔞汁湯。」妻在玄色的旗衫上罩上白圍裙，帶著一頭忙亂了的頭髪，含著甜甜的笑意。剝開蟹殻的時候，朋友們開始向我說出成堆的羨慕話，「幸福哪！」他們不顧紅楓葉一張張掉下來，卻僅喝著醇厚的麥燒。</p>
<p>「撕著這些蟹，在沒幸福的人等於撕著自已。自已不正在被人家撕著吃嗎？」一個朋友這麼說，充溢著沈鬰的哀愁。可是「爲什麼要過於傷感呢，你睢楓葉掉落的時候，菊花不是開了嗎，蟹是吃不盡的，它還有笧人的鰲呵。」在妃色的暮靄裹，紅色的的楓葉泛了紫，大家都覺得身上有了寒意。</p>
<h3>菊癖</h3>
<p>— 金雄宇</p>
<p>看見人家併著的菊花，連想到吾邑某翁菊癖的趣史。菊花春由宿根生，夏至分植，深秋開花：種類極多，「李時珍說有九百品」，約分二種，莖紫氣香而味甘者，爲真菊，供騷人墨客之賞玩：莖青有蒿艾氣其味苦者，俗稱野菊入藥。</p>
<p>翁張姓，年已古稀，精神矍鑠，詩書之暇，藝菊成癖，每年所種，數達千盆，種類之多，培植之精，爲一邑冠；其宅後有曠地焉，闢爲園，圍以籬；行人過其處，每見翁之菊徑偏僂，扶植備至；另僱工二人，專司移運灌溉；園門森嚴，茍非聲同道合，不得其門而入。</p>
<p>余與張翁有世誼，得時相顧從，憶去年今日，正花開遍園，花香滿室，供桌陳堂，頗多雅趣，乃邀朋引侶，共聚一堂，杯酒持鰲，與壽客作對景，俄而觥籌交錯，或吟詩，或寫真，樂乃無限。客之有同察者，作進一步之週旋，徘徊就菊，而詳審之，時翁亦離座，追隨於客之左右，防有風雅之舉，致佳種之流散，余念瓜李有嫌，袖手旁觀隨賀而已。</p>
<p>民十三秋，齋虛之爭，吾邑駐兵數日，亦蒙其害。軍官中有好菊者，過翁園，適菊花初放，遂同護兵入園，擇種之佳者，攜取數本而去，翁知之，氣憤填胸，曰士可屈，而花不可辱，急足直追，且呼且奔，雖汗流浹背，而不捨，軍官見其疾態可掬，慈悲心動，竟笑而還之，至今傳爲美談，咸呼之謂菊公云。</p>
<h3>蟹的吃法</h3>
<p>— （陸士方）</p>
<p>一炸蟹以蟹置鍋中，入水少許，煮熟後，即可食。食時，蕪以醬油及薑絲等，鮮美絕倫。此法烹食甚簡單，亦最能保持蟹之真味，惟以大者爲宜。</p>
<p>（二）油醬蟹　以一蟹對臍剖爲二，塗以麪粉，置入油鍋中煎之，再加醬油酒等，略燒片刻即熟。食之亦甚可口，但微嫌油膩。</p>
<p>（三）燉蟹　以蟹斷其鰲及足，與軀幹同置碗中，加醬油酒少許，放入鍋蒸之，熟後取食。味頗鮮美。</p>
<p>（四）醉蟹　以較小之蟹，浸以酒，（惟須浸透）貯於甕中，而封其口，數日後，取出食之，別有風味。</p>
<p>（五）蟹粉　將蟹煎熟後，剝取其肉與脂黃，謂之蟹粉。如與肉絲或豆腐等同炒食，味甚可口。</p>
<h3>菊話</h3>
<p>— 吳遠齋</p>
<p>往年先伯的扁釐上，書有朱元璋詠菊古詩一首，幼時常見，因得記熟，至今不忘，詩云：「百花發，我不發，我若發，都駭煞，要與西風戰一場，徧身穿就黃金甲，」蓋詠黃菊花詩也。周茂叔稱菊爲花之隱逸者，陶靖節本高尚隱士，性之所近，同氣相求，故獨愛菊，引爲知已。但自朱元璋封建君主做起菊花詩來，即含有帝制思想，溢於言表，朱元璋本一無賴平民，一躍而登九五，成則爲王，敗則爲寇，既做了皇帝，後來疑忌文人，以作則而疑爲作賊，以曰生而疑爲曰僧，懷疑人家罵他曾經做過賊又做過和尚，以同音的字，竟犯著大忌諱，起了無謂的文字獄，殺了許多冤枉的大臣。他那句「遍身穿就黃金甲」的詩，就與項羽徵賤時，看見秦始皇出巡說「彼可取而代也」的那句話，一樣的口吻。世間上任何物類，在觀察的人方面，各有各的心理作用，所謂「仁者見之謂之仁，智者見之謂之智，豈僅對於菊花如此？」</p>
<p>現在愛菊的人，固然很多，但是品格和操守上，能稱爲菊的知已，又有多少呢？人欲橫流，懷著富貴思想的，確實不少，雖「不義而富且貴」亦求之不得。牡丹爲富貴花，能和牡丹做知已的人，實在多得很。菊花的真知已，恐怕不及這樣多了，「人生最難得者爲知已」，不僅人是如此，菊花也有這樣的同情。</p>
<p>前在某報上，見有一篇翻案的文字，咒詛菊花，說菊花是投機份子，有惡臭剌鼻，簡直把菊花說得毫無價值，一種犀利的筆鋒，不能稱爲「推陳山新的絕妙文章了。」但是我真替菊花呌屈！</p>
<p>咒誼菊花，本是游戲聞頑笑的，因此我悟得「茅落寡合」的人，到處碰壁，雖然沒有可罵的道理，也要想出些話來，咒詛排擠啊！</p>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>蟹的種種</h3>
<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>光陰過得真快，一眨眨眼又到了丹楓染脂，黃菊破綻的時候。一般騷人詞客，又要及時行樂，對菊持鰲，秋老蟹肥，正是應時第一美味。</p>
<p>記得在蘇州供職的時候，因爲陽澄湖鰲，久已膾炙人口，每晚必命茶役購兩隻，一快朶顧。但總不能買到金爪黃毛的，相傳陽澄湖蟹，比較其它產處有異，金爪黃毛，放在金漆桌上，懸腹疾爬，足部有力。</p>
<p>朋友告訴我，真正陽澄湖蟹，就是蘇州人也吃不到的。它們都運銷上海了，我暗暗的嘆上海人口腹不淺！</p>
<p>有一次，局中幾個同事說得高興，舉行一個食蟹比賽參加簽名的一共十八人，借韓家巷鶴園舉行，鶴園的景級很不錯，極佔園林之勝！</p>
<p>比賽的法規，誰吃得最快，最凈，最多，爲第一名，有獎，公送紋銀酒杯一隻，結果，葛云雲君佔第一，費三小時又十分，食蟹九十二隻，衆人都欽偑它的吃法很精，到了夜半腹痛如紋，忙請吳光民醫生替它灌腸，顧諠如先生替它診脈，銀杯雖被他得了，但很不劃算。究竟蟹性太寒，不可多吃。</p>
<p>蟹是在水裹的甲殻物動，性很寒，蟹的吃法，先用毛刷子在清水中把它身上的污泥洗去，兩鰲的毛上污濁更多，必須洗得清潔。擠去臍中蟹污，嵌入生薑一片，食鹽數粒，用蔴綫紥定。鍋中放入清水，距水面寸許，置一竹蔑蒸具，在中藥肆中購紫蘇銅元三枚，清水洗浄，舖平，把蟹放在紫蘇上，把水煮沸，再爛片刻。如果內中有了有毒的蟹，它見了紫蘇的氣味，蟹殼自會裂開的。吃的時候，最好用薑末調鎮江玫瑰醋，但是放在碗中，加陳酒，醬油，食鹽，生薑，燉食也好，更有把蟹剖做兩爿，和入麵粉，放入油鍋內炸的，名油炸蟹，可是總沒有蒸食味美。</p>
<p>蟹腹中兩旁有蟹蓑衣，熱時取下，在生過凍豕的手足疤痕上，用力的擦十幾下，可是一到冬天，不論天氣怎樣的嚴寒，手足上是不會再患凍豕了。願穿長統絲襪的摩登姑娘試騐一下！我保證必黨必騐。</p>
<p>蟹腹內有蟹和尚一個，性很寒，吃了容易使人生病，吃蟹的朋友不可不注意。</p>
<p>蟹和柿，是相反的，本草上載得很詳細，因爲兩種都是性寒的，如果不慎吃了，就格外會使腹痛。倘若吃了蟹偶然覺得腹痛，可用龍眼肉四錢，煮湯服下，痛可立止。</p>
<p>蟹的季節不長，九十兩月，最應時，所以有九尖十團的俗諺，尤其是十月中是最最好的時候，不論雌雄，都是腸肥腦滿。但是用一隻小罎，罎底舖些榖在裹面，再把蟹放入，蟹上再蓋榖使滿，可藏兩月，取食，格外味美。吃畢之後，最妙用菊葉洗乎可不腥。</p>
<p>蟹上市的時候，我每隔一二日必購蟹三隻，兩團一尖，到酒店中，監視酒保代爲洗凈，蒸籠內撒紫蘇，把蟹放入，蒸熱後乘熱，用蕃醋拌食，飮酒斤半。所剩的蟹腳，呼酒保代拆蟹粉，用鷄蛋兩枚，炒蟹粉蛋飯一碗，吃得很覺舒適。</p>
<p>孕婦不宜吃蟹，因其性寒，並且蟹爪容易墮胎，慎之！俗傳有孕時吃蟹，日後生下小孩，小孩口涎特多，流而不止，這倒並不能確定呢。蟹殼留到夏天，把它磨碎成粉，再加入鐠魚骨曬燥磨粉，用木屑拌勻，裝入紙筒內，就是很好的蚊蟲香了。</p>

<p>十九　暫行新刑律關於短期自由刑易科罰金之規定爲現行法所不採因之受短期自由刑之宣告者不問有何窒礙均須送監執行事實上頗感不便且偶然犯罪之人因受短期監禁沾染惡習亦所難免法界多有主張恢復此制者故本案於嚴格條件之下準予易科罰金</p>
<p>二十　罰金繳納期間現行法定爲一個月似嫌太促本案改爲兩個月現行法罰金易科監禁最長期得至一年易與短期徒刑相混本案改爲罰金祇得易服勞役並以六個月爲限又現行法規定罰金完納期間得本人之承諾即得易科殊失財產刑之本旨故本案改爲非經強制執行後無力完納時不得易服勞役</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>再論藝術的形式和遺產</h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>看到了十月十八日「野」先生在本刋上對我提出的異議，我很高興。真的，「文壇上倘若客客氣氣毫無論爭」，「那，倒是文學的死癥」。但因爲我現在不能迅速地看到國內的新聞雜誌，不能快捷地來進行我們的討論，這一點是我所引爲莫大的遺憾的。</p>
<p>「野」先生首先指出的，是說我在「藝術的形式和遺產」一文的頭一段裹，所說的話，有「很容易使人陷於這一誤解」的地方，「即以爲：瘊定形式的，並不是內容，而乃是作家在其把所攝取的現實材料，與以藝術的加工這一過程中作家底風格底特殊性。」</p>
<p>在這裹，倘若我的拙劣的文字，不能完全表達我的意思，而致引起讀者諸君生出這樣的誤解來；那末，我是完全授受「野」先生的指摘的，除了最後那一句之外（我們接著就要說到的）。但我在那裹說的是這樣：「在藝術上，形式的主要表現是在於作家的風格。」這話也許就是惹起誤解的根源。固然，形式和內容「有著不可分離的合法則性在」。藝術家的特殊底的風格，是由於藝術家所處的社會的諸條件，以及藝術家的社會底生活等等所決定的，所形成的。不同的社會條件，不同的社會生活，使得即使生在同一時代，同一社會的藝術家，都有不同的藝術底風格。甚至同一社會層的作家，也因其才能，經騐的不同，而形成了特殊的風格。所以我們雖不能將藝術作品的形式，和作家的風格混爲一談，但決定之兩種東西的基本要素，卻有許多是共通的。風格之不能全然決定形式，是顯然的事，因爲牠們同是爲更根本良的東西所決定的。但是我們能否認風格和形式的密切的，不可分離的聯擊麼？我們讀著莎士比亞的戲劇，在那形式裹面（當然是和那內容相對底的獨立的），我們不是首先就注意到那潑剌底特殊底的風格麼？我的前面那句話，倘若在這種意味上去理解，也許就不致引起誤解吧。而且，我接著說：「藝術家首要的工作是從現實攝取了藝術的內容，其次……。」這和「野」先生所說的「所謂作家底藝術的表現形式在這裹是表現爲第二義的東西。在作家底藝術的製作過程中成爲第一義的東西，寗乃是作家對於現實底態度……」比較起來，我覺得除了應該非難我的拙劣的文字底的表現之外，在那內容上是很難找到相反的所在的。</p>
<p>「野」先生又把世界觀和歷史的客觀底發展的矛盾，以及世界觀和創作方法的矛盾，混爲一談。而我覺得世界觀和歷史的客觀發展的矛盾，是因爲那決定並造成世界觀的社會底集團的意識，要求，違背了歷史的客觀發展所促成的。而一切矛盾的解決，除了在實踐中去實行以外，還有別的什麼地方呢？但這是一般的說法。我們不能忘記：我們現在所談的是藝術—我們是在說藝術家的世界觀和創作方法！</p>
<p>歷史的事實充分地爲我們證明。爲什麼一個世界觀和創作方法矛看的作家，會緩緩地，迂迥地使他的世界觀趨向於客觀底現實：而另一種同樣的作家，卻沒有這種現象。這，除了說前者是有現實主義底創作方法的實踐，後者卻沒有（當然他也「創作」的，但那是離開了現實的，不是我們所說的「創作底實踐」的意義）這種東西以外，我們還能怎樣的解釋呢？請看「野」先生的話罷：「巴爾札克和托爾斯泰底意識是違背歷史的，惟其如此，他們不曾圓滿地把握到世界觀和創作方法的統一，也正是這一點制約了他們底發展和表現於其作品中的動搖底意識。然而這一點仍不妨礙他們成爲一個現實主義者。」在這裹「野」先生一點也沒有給我們解釋巴爾札克等，怎麼會從「違背歷史的」「動搖底意識」，達成偉大的現實主義者；那個「然而」並不能做爲從前者過渡到後者的橋樑。</p>
<p>末了，「野」先生一再地提到「風格的模倣」。我重複地說一遍，這種「搖身一變」的說法，是最容易使我們的討論散漫和出岔的。我說遇「大可值得我們的注意和吟味」，「也非可以忽視」，我一點也沒有說過風格的模倣。作家的風格，如前所說，是由作家的社會底生活，才能等等所形成的，在初學寫作的人，模倣別的作家的風格，是常有的現象，但這是暫時的。</p>
<p>我贊同承繼偉大的古典作家的遺產，是「關聯到古典作家底創作方法底整體」這意見。但我特別地指出了藝術的綜合形式。爲什麼呢因爲這一點是「大可值得我們的注意和吟味」的。在研究這問題時，怎樣地綜合和綜合成怎樣，是我們注意的焦點。我們要在那種綜合的，潑刺的形式中，去研究古典作家的創作方法。倘若這就是「把問題太狹隘化了」，我是寗願「狹隘化」下去的。</p>
<h3>歸來（下）</h3>
<p>— 吳巖</p>
<p>那時我就覺這個人有點奇怪，一方面同他好，一方面也在防備也，本來想買一件外套。來遮一遮十二月的寒風的，但怕遭遇著威克斐牧師傳中摩西赴市賣馬買眼鏡那一段可笑的故事。便索性購買另外的棉衣。等到離開香港，發現他並沒有和小販一塊登岸去時，就全覺得他只是一個好心腸的旅伴罷了。一個同路人，只要認出他心腸好，本質不壞，即使在某些時候使你不高興，你也會漸漸原諒他同他全好起來的，因此，我也同這位慣愛附和別人的旅伴，不久就談得起勁了，而他確也有使人喜歡談話的本事的。</p>
<p>一面談，他的右手便在大衣袋裹無意地摸索，等到我在抖落衣上的煤煙時（這幾乎是半點鐘內就要抖落一次的）手從衣袋裹露出來了，連同一捲印有楷字的紅紙。先用那一對討人好的眼睛望我一下，才謹慎地分了一張給我。上面講的是；敝店三層洋樓，面臨海邊，電燈電扇，設備俱全，招待飮食，週到且廉……</p>
<p>「到廈門時，務請到敝店住哪！」</p>
<p>這還有什麼說的，兩人剛才談利那麼高興，當然只有答允了，而且旅館始終是要住的，我答允之後，他便將外套更加緊緊地一裹，忽忽走下去了，我仍留著，看野蠻的夜色吞沒著海天和務，聽外國旗和風和浪打成一片的標悍聲音。</p>
<p>我回到我住的地方，看見洋鐵箱上，竹綱籃上，都貼著同樣的紅色紙條，別人的行李上也是照樣的貼著。旁邊坐著吸煙的水手，見我在望，便將煙頭的灰，彈打一彈，說道：</p>
<p>「這家店子不錯呀—無論你住幾天，店錢只算你三塊，真是天公地道！」</p>
<p>在印度洋上的時候，甲板上全住滿了人，無論白天和夜晚。現在來到太平洋上了，一些旅客早從香港登了岸，剩著的又都給冷霧和寒風趕下了艙，於是空空的甲板，便留給水手們做賣炒麵和小吃的所在。我將手挿在褲袋裹，像遊夜市那麼似的走走，態度非常的悠閒。</p>
<p>「唔，喝一杯酒吧！」</p>
<p>我抬頭看，原來是那位旅館的招攬者在招呼我了，他正同一些人在放著起重機的旁邊，歡然地喝著酒，並且剛才對我說話的水手也同他坐在一塊的。</p>
<p>船泊在廈門的港中，別家旅館的接客，都蜂湧似的登上了船，爭向我倆飛著各色的招帖，口裹喊著各種旅館的名字。他，這位對人常常閃有溫和眼波的，便用大姆指和中指向人家的面前，劈拍作聲道：</p>
<p>「對不起！都貼好了！」</p>
<p>別人都像有點害怕他似的，趕緊走開了。他呌小船把我們一羣客人送上岸去，於是三層半洋式的房子，很舊的現了出來，屋裹既沒有電扇，也沒有分開的小房間，僅有蓆子的床，一張連一張地，討人厭地圍繞著我們。從脫落玻璃片的窗上看出去，車輛來往的碼頭和桅檣林立的港面，就在店前不遠的地方。</p>
<p>「快一點，想我剝你的皮嗎？」</p>
<p>他剛向一個搬箱子的夥計這樣地罵，突然看見另一個夥計，把槓在肩頭兩捲被蓋，滾一塊在地板上，便把他頭上的打島帽朝桌上一丟，大衣的袖子兩挽，氣虎虎地呌道：</p>
<p>「揍死你！」</p>
<p>但是並沒有打，好像是在嚇人一樣。然而全店子裹面都充滿了他的剌耳的聲音了，使一個過了半月海上風濤，想得暫時安息的旅人，簡直會感到異常不快起來。我便和別的好幾個客人一樣，住了一會，要換店子，他就笑嘻嘻地跑了過來，依舊閃著向人討好的眼睛，說：</p>
<p>「也好也好，不過，三塊錢的店賬要給的，不管住不住。這是老規鉅！」</p>
<p>尾後的話說得非常之硬，彷佛老規鉅就是法律一樣，同時看看我們的箱子和綱籃，已經貼上另外一張紙條了，顏色雖是一樣，但寫的卻全然改變，而且和他的店子的內容，剛是吻合著的。我們不願住，又不願同他麻煩，便照話給他三塊了。雖是遇著這樣不痛快的事情，然而足已履在自已的國土裹面，總算是愉快的，高興的了。但到第二天在鼓浪嶼，又看見在仰光，在星加坡，在香港所看見的，同樣的大包頭，同樣的木捧同樣的棕色臉子時，於是重新感到一隻巨大的手掌，無形地又籠罩在頭上，而心裹也依舊浮起了沉重的熱帶國度的憂鬰了。</p>
<h3>十一月的街</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>十一月的街，流著峭冷的西北風，小鎮的街市是蕭條的，舖子裹，無綫電放送著顫落的歌聲。</p>
<p>上市的農民一起起地，挽著籃子，攏著手，飢餓的眼珠兒直是向著舖子裹溜望，也有挾著衣包在當舖門口踟躕著的。</p>
<p>我悄悄地走上街，又惘然的悄悄地走回來了，在拐灣那兒的橋堍下，突然遇到一個久別的朋友。</p>
<p>—幾時回來拉？</p>
<p>—才三天。</p>
<p>—在那兒得意的呀？</p>
<p>然而意外的這朋友的臉一沉，楞了下兒。</p>
<p>—回來，什麼也完啦！</p>
<p>—唔…是？</p>
<p>—我在一個公司嘗點小差兒，公司倒啦！</p>
<p>—那麼便打算上那里？</p>
<p>沒答，我瞧見他的臉是侷促不安的，像不能回答我一句話？</p>
<p>—老×，你呢？</p>
<p>我苦笑自臉，搖搖頭。</p>
<p>像所有的話全已說完。</p>
<p>—老×，天冷囉！</p>
<p>—冷囉！</p>
<p>他的腳在地上一擦一擦地，要走了。</p>
<p>—那兒去？</p>
<p>—…隨便走，他兩隻手塞在衣袋內，走了，肩膀一聳一聳的。</p>
<p>我站在橋堍下目送他的背影，我想著上了橋的那段中市街上，是有一家當舖的。</p>
<p>十一月的街，流著峭寒的西北風，我攜著惘然的哀愁，走回去了默默地。</p>

<h3>紗花收貨說漫市塲本月紗轉向回高</h3>
<p>—餘月亦一致帶好—</p>
<p>紗市轉堅、又現回漲之狀、某公司在本月份繼續購買、有收貨之說、遠明亦被帶昻、但金融界之多頭斬結不少、枱面略鬆、日商仍在空頭地位、不過邇來現紗銷路尚屬良好、各廠底貨減少、紗市得力不少、</p>
<p>近月紗回好一元六七</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以上日大跌之後、市價尚婆、但塲中新賣風未熾、各月微漲二三角、拍至二三盤步開步緊、查其原因、謂某公司職進本月份、收貨空氣頗濃、結果各月均漲八角至一地三五角、午後商塲傳說、通成公司本月份收貨之空氣涵漫市塲、聞現紗有一千二百包、人心尚昻、各月又漲二·三·五角、全日成交統計四萬一千一百包、查賣出吉豐九百五十包、穗隆一千三百包、源大一千四百包、森康七百包、慎記五百五十包、願大一千○五十包、元泰六百包、益昶五百五十包、長豐四百包、仁豐七百五十包、德記六百包、買進通記八百五十包、大孚一千一百包、大豐一千七百五十包、錦昌四百包、明德六百五十包、振大七百包、賡豐二千六百包、義成六百五十包、信誠九百包、慎昌一千一百包、潤康七百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>實銷仍有一千餘包</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚佳、查全日各幫買去、統計一千二百○五包、行情漲一元外、怡和廠開出二十支五福價一百八十一元、牧羊一百八十三元、共計一千二百包、扣全傭連稅在內、現期出清、實銷如下、</p>
<h3>棉花抵空回上</h3>
<p>棉市回堅、美棉續跌、形勢頗疲、然本埠人心未受若何影響、因有一部份空頭獲利抵補、市盤乃轉堅昻、但現棉銷路頗滯云、</p>
<p>鄭標轉漲</p>
<p>標棉前市開盤、以美棉跌風仍烈、而金價平平、匯兌微長、塲中人心不佳、但紗市平定、近月尚漲五分至一角、遠期反跌一角、抬至二三盤、枱面稍緊、空頭抵補、結果各月均漲一角至二角半、午後市氣尚平、各月漲跌五分至一·二·角、全日成交統計八萬九千一百擔、查賣出恒益一千三百擔、大孚二千六百擔、通記一千五百擔、穗隆一千八百擔、源大四千七百擔、慎昌一千八百擔、長豐四千五百擔、同和一千七百擔、源與昌四千五百擔、長和一千二百擔、大豐一千四百擔、振大一千擔、慎記一千四百擔、買進吉豐、五千四百擔、恒益二千一百擔、賡豐六千二百擔、元一三千四百損、潤康五千九百擔、大孚二千一百擔、通記一千三百擔、慎昌一千一百擔、長豐五千一百擔、長和二千擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>棉銷滯鈍</p>
<p>現棉銷路依然滯鈍、各廠辦意甚懈、來源計姚花一千三百包、通花六百五十包云、</p>
<h3>十月期美棉起反動</h3>
<p>—現貨需要不佳—</p>
<p>紐約棉市之行動、與前日適成一反比例、五月份下跌十六磅音、十月份遠期僅跌五磅音、蓋一般以爲價根低落過劇、且無充分理由、遂從事收買十月份遠期、惟信任心則因市價連續下降、大起動搖、當地與國外浮多頗有（十二月期）了結、各方現棉需要遲緩、支加哥可的公司所發表之估計數量、爲九百六十七萬包、按前月之數量爲九百二十三萬包、政府現已爲左右市塲之重要主體、如欲解目下之情形、則華盛頓方面須有新辦法、英棉期貨跌九至十點、印棉因利物浦消息失望及投機家賣出而疲、計平果爾漲二角半、奧姆辣不動、自羅溪跌七角半、雇電錄左、（一日電）</p>
<h3>糧食洋麥稅率有再增說期粉回漲亦猛速</h3>
<p>昨日紛市、上午開盤後、各月份呈反漲甚烈之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近漲七角零、遠期四角零、坎拿大漲五六角不等、故開價時、因前日大跌、不過發生回頭、兼之洋麥報漲、是以業內外投機多頭、一致搶買、故開價較之前日、計回起三四分不等、二盤形熱仍佳、三盤以後、因一部分多頭回出、回跌二分、各盤交易、依然暢旺、蓋投機幫之進出熱鬧異常也、迨至下午開盤、各月份又忽高漲、以市塲謠傳、洋麥稅率、又再加之說、更以福建幫略有現貨交易、多頭遂更抬高無已、查近日市面、完全爲投機活動所策動、實際上殊無考慮之必要、結果本月份較前日漲四分七厘半、十二月份漲五分七厘半、一月份漲五分半、二月份漲六分、三月月份漲六分二厘半、四月份漲六分半、</p>
<h3>加麥限制最小價格中美麥價一起上騰</h3>
<p>—附答復麥價之計算法—</p>
<p>昨期麥市面（上下午開盤後、各月份均呈回振之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲四角至七角不等、坎拿大漲五六角左右、上午各盤、人心已漸帶起、交易亦頗活絡、較前日計好三五六分不等、迨下午開盤、因粉市復振、業外客戶、又極力爭進、故各盤開價、又復步高、目下紛麥市塲、大部分以洋麥爲轉移、對於實銷如何、反少置意、故忽漲忽跌、殊少把握、結果十一·十二月份較漲九分、一月份漲一角一分、二月份漲九分、現麥市面、略見軟疲、較前日抑三四分、開山東徐州麥三元八角一分、瑤灣麥三元八角、揚州麥三元七角二分、計二萬五千包、由福新辦去、）</p>
<p>溫尼配雜糧價格、自今日（一日）已由政府訂定、計十二月份最小價格爲七角五分、五月份爲八角、予支加哥以良好影響、加以現貨堅挺、及本地潛勢強盛、價格猛漲二分、按溫尼配價格之訂定、至何時方止、雖未宣布、然一般以爲此係暫時性質、將來另有辦法、</p>
<p>又據十一月一日芝加哥小麥報告云、春麥收成平均每畝爲七斛、而生產總數則爲八十兆斛、一俟所放棄之田畝最後加以確定後、生產或將較目前所表示者爲少也、冬麥生產估計乃三八六兆斛、故今年麥產將爲四六六兆、而國內需要據估計已佔六五○兆矣○</p>
<p>日來有以來本報麥市新聞中洋麥漲跌之差額如何計算、及芝加哥小麥行市、係用何種單位相詢者、茲爲答復如下、查麥市新聞中所云洋麥漲跌之度、係照洋麥行市、折合爲一噸之數、以計算其差額、如芝加哥小麥價上日爲九五·二五、本日爲九七·七五、漲二·二五、此係美斛一斛之價、三十三美斛爲一噸、則以三三乘之、即美麥一噸比上日漲起美金五十四分二五、再芝加哥小麥行市、係爲每蒲式爾（俗稱美斛、簡作蒲、）計價、而價格則以美金「分」爲單位也、</p>
<h3>新薄稻下挫角許</h3>
<p>滬南　各幫來源較旺、計共到近六十號、貨共近九千石、薄稻居多、六種等薄稻市況適遇包胃淡泊、遂呈下游之策、計青島幫採納新鎮六中一儀、數祇百餘包、而零胃本屬有限、見跌角砠、惟野白稻等厚新粳、則以本街銷化猶能振作、到貨略夥、兼受薄稻牽制、尚可卓然挺立、且若少數貨品猶有帶緊、形勢頗覺可觀、結果呈數分秀色、杜洋尖頗合店胃、市色占鮮尺奇、陰變元供求相仿、亦現轉定之象、</p>
<p>滬北昨河下內地城鄉到頭漸湧、約近四十號左右、河存百十餘艘、市上各貨去胃、新粳破粳陳白元新杜尖零銷早市清淡、午市略多、薄稻早稻陰元尚佳、新羊秈新陳埠客失平常、市形新粳高貨挺立、中次疲去角外、破粳新羊秈新陳埠客秈價形平定、薄稻早稻軟之勢、陳白元價小一角、陰元新杜尖挺立、</p>

The three things that have already been started are the elimination of opium addiction, the liberation of bound feet, and the treatment of trachoma. If there are ten years of peace and prosperity, China, under the guidance of the New Life Movement, will definitely become the greatest country in the world. Now that China has restored its great position, it will surely contribute to the welfare of the world and make a spiritual contribution of great value. When asked what kind of political system Chairman Chiang considers the best for China, Madame Chiang smiled and said that Chairman Chiang has no intention of imitating Hitler or Mussolini, because what is suitable for one country may not be suitable for another.

<h3>Ma Yinchu Talks About the Commercial Registration Law</h3>
<p>Whether the Issue of Responsibility Should Be Included Is Still Under Study</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Ma Yinchu answered questions from guests, saying that the Commercial Registration Law is a special law in the Civil Code. Because the Civil Code has provisions for managers and apprentices, but there are no provisions for commercial registration and account books, the Registration Law was drafted. The Civil Code stipulates that the responsibility of shareholders in an unlimited company is joint and unlimited liability. If there are losses, any shareholder should be responsible for repayment. Representatives of the Chamber of Commerce believe that this method will make investors hesitate at this time of commercial recession and advocate for no responsibility for sharing. That is, shareholders bear the responsibility separately. The debts that each shareholder should bear do not involve shareholders who are unable to repay and those who are able to repay. However, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that if unlimited responsibility for sharing is adopted, there will be many drawbacks. According to current common practices, joint responsibility for sharing is adopted, that is, if a company is composed of five people and owes 100,000, even if two of them are unable to repay, the remaining three people should be responsible for repaying the entire debt. This method is more suitable. The meaning of the Registration Law is to seek unity between civil and commercial law. The principle focuses on registering commercial names and account books. As for the issue of responsibility, whether it should be included is still under study. Even if it is planned to be included, in order to balance the situation and not contradict the Civil Code and Commercial Law, most people plan to adopt joint responsibility for sharing. A decision will be made at the next meeting. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<h3>Our Country's Reduced Foreign Trade and National Economy</h3>
<p>— An Analysis</p>
<p>The statistics for our country's foreign trade for the first nine months of this year have already been published by the Customs. (See the Customs Monthly Report for September.) The total import value was 795,114,098 yuan, a decrease of approximately 268,190,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. The total export value was 399,205,816 yuan, a decrease of approximately 59,800,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. Imports exceeded exports by a considerable amount, approximately 400 million yuan. From the perspective of our country's national economy, what is the significance of these changes in foreign trade volume?</p>
<p>Observing the history of our country's foreign trade development, the phenomenon of import surpluses did not originate today. For the past few decades, except for a slight increase in exports during the European War, there have been significant import surpluses in almost every year. However, is this phenomenon of import surpluses truly a fundamental illness of the national economy? Not necessarily. Consider England, an island nation, which annually needs to import a vast quantity of industrial raw materials, making an import surplus inevitable. Yet, England remains one of the world's great powers. From this, we can see that the increase or decrease in the amount of import surpluses in trade is not sufficient to be regarded as a measure of the health of the national economy. This is very clear. The total import surplus for the first nine months of this year in our country has decreased by 208,387,778 yuan compared to the same period last year. If we say that the reduction in the import surplus is a decrease in the leakage of national wealth, it is not unreasonable to consider it an improvement in the national economy. However, upon careful examination, there is a significant error.</p>
<p>The current reduction in foreign trade volume is actually a symbol of the decline in national purchasing power. In a short period of nine months, imports of foreign goods have decreased to around 300 million yuan. This is sufficient to show the decline in people's purchasing power, without any doubt. No wonder the export of raw silver has gradually become a powerful means of international payment. According to Customs statistics, the net export of raw gold and silver in the third quarter of this year was 180 million yuan. This is truly an unprecedented record in previous years. However, it is also an inevitable trend. From another perspective, because of the contraction of export trade to China, various countries are feeling the need to expand markets and the urgency to recover trade losses. They will inevitably cause more acute market competition. With the immaturity of our country's industries, there is a possibility of further threats. In recent years, foreign capital rapidly entering our domestic market has not weakened due to the reduction in import surpluses, and the disease of the national economy is deepening day by day. It is a pity that this year's export trade could not take advantage of the opportunity of the contraction of foreign imports to expand. In the world, only when exhausted does one change, and only by changing does one get through. When will the future of our country's national economy change and get through to reach the time of this improvement?</p>

<h3>Trends in British Politics: Labour Party Achieves Great Victory in Municipal Elections</h3>
<p>Restoring the Position Before 1931</p>
<p>Conservative Party and Communist Party Both Fail</p>
<p>[London] The British Labour Party suffered a major defeat in the 1931 municipal elections, but this year it has high hopes of achieving a great victory, not only in London, but throughout the country, especially in industrial areas. One-third of provincial district councils are re-elected every year, so elections are held every year. However, the system in London is not like this. The 28 district councils are completely re-elected every three years. Therefore, after the 1931 general election, London voters did not have the opportunity to express their feelings until this year. The results of the election have not yet been fully known, but based on the results that have been announced, the Labour Party has an overwhelming advantage. It has already won ten districts in the London municipal elections, which are all under its influence. According to today's news, the Labour Party won 52 of the 53 seats in the Southwark district, and all those elected in the Poplar district were Labour Party members. Only one non-Labour Party member was elected in the Bermondsey district. The gains and losses of the Labour Party and the Municipal Reform Party in various districts of London are as follows: the Labour Party won 222 seats and lost 1 seat, and the Municipal Reform Party won 1 seat and lost 214 seats. The situation is similar in other places. The Labour Party won 203 seats and lost 8 seats, the Conservative Party won 3 seats and lost 109 seats, the Liberal Party won 4 seats and lost 34 seats, and the Independent Party won 5 seats and lost 14 seats. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[London] Yesterday, municipal council elections were held throughout the country. According to the results that have been clarified so far, the Labour Party has gained 195 more seats in the provinces than before, and 226 more seats in the districts of London than before. The Labour Party has maintained its original majority in the municipal halls of four districts in London, and in six other districts, where the Labour Party previously held only a minority, it has now won a majority of seats. So far, none of the Communist Party candidates have been elected. There are still 575 seats in the municipal council elections that have not been determined, but the results that have been clarified so far are sufficient to prove that the Labour Party has achieved a great victory, especially in the industrial centers and the capital. The Labour Party has not only retained the cities where it originally held a majority, but also several large cities, such as Altrincham, Bromley, Batley, Farnworth, Leicester, and Dukinfield, whose representatives in the House of Commons have always been government parties. Now, these cities have seen the Labour Party win a majority for the first time and no longer become the base of the Conservative Party. As for other cities, although the Labour Party did not win a majority of seats, the number of seats it won greatly increased, especially in Liverpool and Manchester. Foreign Secretary Simon's wife was one of the candidates and was defeated. The "Manchester Guardian" commented on the initial results of the election, saying that the Labour Party's power will be even stronger than in 1931. To put it bluntly, the Conservative Party was the most injured in this election throughout the country. (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

Thomas agreed to submit the petition to the British Emperor within days. The document stated that the Australian Federal Government treated Western Australia unfairly in many ways, especially in financial matters.

<h3>US Government Persists in Open Door Policy</h3>
<p>Preparing to Raise Another Protest with Japan</p>
<p>British Parliament Will Also Have Questions</p>
<p>[Washington] The Associated Press learned from the authorities today that the State Department is now considering raising another protest with Japan regarding the oil issue in "Manchukuo". Washington will not allow Japan to evade responsibility, because "Manchukuo" is nothing more than Japan's puppet. Undersecretary of State Phillips declared that the US government is currently considering Japan's proposed oil monopoly in Manchuria from all aspects, and said that the United States will take further action. The United States believes that the oil monopoly in "Manchukuo" is an absolute act of destroying the Open Door Policy, and the US government still believes that Japan should be directly responsible for maintaining equal trade opportunities for all countries in "Manchukuo". As for Japan's claim that the United States should directly negotiate with "Manchukuo", official circles believe that this is Tokyo evading responsibility. Now the United States is clearly unwilling to talk with "Manchukuo". Furthermore, it has been discovered here that at least eight-tenths of the capital of this oil monopoly is supplied by Japan, which makes it impossible for Japan to evade responsibility. As for how the British and Dutch governments will react to Japan's reply, there is no news here today. (National dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>[London] It was learned today that Parliament will fiercely question the government's policy towards Japan next Monday. In the House of Lords, Sir Cecil will question whether the British industrial survey team to Manchuria has the qualifications to represent the British government in stating national policy, and whether the government has taken steps to prevent Japan's misunderstanding of the team. In the House of Commons, Montagu will question whether the government's attitude towards not recognizing "Manchukuo" has changed, and Morris will also question Foreign Secretary Simon whether the "Manchukuo" oil monopoly will affect the British debt guaranteed by customs duties. In addition, more than a dozen other questions are also prepared to be raised, prompting the British government to clearly express its latest policy regarding the tense Far East issue.

<h3>Japan Will Officially Reply to Britain and the United States Next Week</h3>
<p>Saying the Laws and Regulations of the Puppet State Are Internal Affairs</p>
<p>And Do Not Violate the Open Door Principle</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The governments of Britain and the United States cited the Nine-Power Treaty regarding the "Manchukuo" oil statistics program and advocated the Open Door Policy and equal opportunity. They issued notes to the Japanese government in early July of this year. The Japanese government replied separately on August 3 of this year. Recently, it was clearly announced in a conversation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities on the 26th. Afterwards, the British government issued a note to the Japanese government again on August 21, and the US government also issued a note on August 31. However, at that time, due to the British industrial delegation's visit to Japan and other reasons, the reply was delayed. However, to this day, the entire picture of the oil control plan in "Manchukuo" was announced on the 30th of the previous month. Recently, it was decided to entrust the British and American embassies in Japan to hand it over to the two governments next week. The general idea of the reply is as follows:</p>
<p>The "Manchukuo" implemented oil control laws and regulations, which did not violate the principle of the Open Door Policy and equal opportunity. I hope you can understand. Moreover, the "Manchukuo" implementing this control law and regulation is a domestic issue of the country, and should not be interfered with by this government.</p>
<p>It is now decided to formally answer the above situation. As for the Japanese government's oil control law, it has already answered the notes of Britain and the United States separately on the 1st, and it has clearly explained the points based on special circumstances for the implementation of the regulations. This is another issue and is not related to the "Manchukuo" oil control case. (Jiji Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>First Round of Naval Talks Concluded</h3>
<p>Representatives Conduct Off-Site Contacts</p>
<p>[London] Representatives from Britain, the United States, and Japan have not set a date for continuing the meeting this week, so the first round of naval talks can be said to have ended. The stage that has been reached now seems to be that members of each delegation will conduct non-public talks instead of formal meetings. US chief representative Davis has had a private conversation with British Foreign Secretary Simon. Davis informed Simon of the trends of the US-Japan representatives' meeting on the previous day. The Japanese representatives will go to the British Prime Minister's villa for lunch tomorrow. In addition, the British side has not made an appointment to continue meeting this week, and the US side will not make an appointment for continued talks this week. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[London] The disarmament talks between Britain, the United States, and Japan have now concluded everything that should be discussed, and are waiting for a new situation to turn around. Britain is eager to discover and find a way to open the way, but the claims of Britain, the United States, and Japan are very different, and there is almost no hope of compromise. Therefore, the talks had to be postponed until next week. (Jiji Press dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>[London] The representatives of Britain, the United States, and Japan have completely opposing opinions regarding the disarmament policy proposed by Japan. However, recently, the attitudes of the representatives of Britain and the United States have gradually eased, dispelling their policy of absolute opposition, and wanting to find realistic compromise methods. However, if Britain and the United States recognize the principle of military equality, the existing difference of about 400,000 tons between Britain and the United States cannot be investigated in one day or night, and a considerable period of time is necessary. Therefore, whether it is possible to find a way to reconcile the differences between the views of Britain and the United States and the views of the Japanese government has recently become a problem. Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira told the British delegation one day that Japan absolutely opposes the stipulation of differential ratios by treaty, but it is not necessary to require all countries to immediately build warships to the maximum common limit. However, this new atmosphere has not yet appeared on the surface of the talks, and the United States and Japan still adhere to their own claims. (Jiji Press dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The preparatory negotiations for naval reduction convened in London are gradually progressing. The claims of Britain and the United States have become clear, so Foreign Minister Hirota and Navy Minister Osumi met with Prime Minister Okada on the 2nd before the cabinet meeting, and explained in detail the progress of the London negotiations and the claims of Britain and the United States. Regarding this countermeasure, especially the timing of the abolition of the Washington Treaty and other important cases, were all agreed upon. The established policy of the Japanese government will be maintained to the end and will not miss the opportunity. They discussed for a long time. (Jiji Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>US Congressman Suggests Strengthening Air Defense</h3>
<p>Expenditure of 100 Million Yuan</p>
<p>[Washington] Congressman Wilcox today suggested to the Federal Aviation Association that several air defense bases should be established in vital locations to place the United States' territory on a bedrock. According to his suggestion, three air force bases should be established on the Atlantic coast, the same on the Pacific coast, and one each in Panama, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Alaska. The expenditure for each base is estimated at 10 million yuan, totaling 100 million yuan. According to recent news, the Department of the Navy has decided to prepare to establish four strong naval air force bases in the Pacific, regardless of the success or failure of the London talks, and this suggestion has attracted the attention of all sectors.

<h3>Britain Emphasizes Aviation</h3>
<p>[London] Parliamentary Secretary to the Air Ministry Sassoon declared firmly in the House of Commons today that commercial air transport is not only valuable for its speed, but also seeks its stability and comfort. Although French aircraft on the London-Paris route are faster than British aircraft, Imperial Airways carries three times as many passengers as France. The number of French airline passengers has decreased by 30 percent. The subsidies paid by the British government to Imperial Airways are far less than those paid by the United States, France, Germany, and Italy. The reason is mainly that the purpose of the subsidies is to develop air transport on a solid commercial basis, and there is no other intention. In the future, the British government will conclude a contract with Imperial Airways, which will stipulate minimum speed conditions. Concrete plans to increase the speed of aviation affairs between London and other cities in the Empire have been considered for months, but he cannot announce them at present.

<h3>Wakatsuki Does Not Want to Stay in Office</h3>
<p>Kawasaki Yuya's Successor Theory</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The leaders of the Minseito Party are in a dilemma because President Wakatsuki is determined to resign and Commerce Minister Machida refuses to succeed him. However, the executives and party members have not completely given up hope of persuading President Wakatsuki to stay and are determined to carry out this purpose. Even if there are considerable twists and turns in the future, President Wakatsuki may have to give up his resignation. If persuasion fails, the successor president must be evaluated. Therefore, preparations for this aspect must also be made. Since Commerce Minister Machida resolutely refuses to accept and opposes the committee system, Kawasaki Takukichi's theory of being the successor president may be realized as a result of detours.

<h3>Anglo-German Payment Agreement</h3>
<p>British Minister Announces to Parliament</p>
<p>[London] The Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Runciman, announced in the House of Commons today that the Anglo-German debt dispute has been resolved with an agreement. According to the agreement, Germany guarantees to purchase British goods with 55% of the proceeds from German exports to Britain. The German National Bank will also immediately allocate £400,000 to settle outstanding debts to Britain. Discussions for the Anglo-German financial and trade agreement began in earnest after Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economic advisor, arrived in Germany on September 19th, and have gradually progressed. Leith-Ross's mission to Germany had two objectives: first, to find a way for Germany to settle commercial debts of approximately £2 million; and second, to find a way for Germany to guarantee future payments for British goods purchased. Since September 24th, all of Germany's foreign trade has required government approval. British yarn merchants subsequently used a cessation of exports to Germany as a form of resistance. Eighteen textile factories in Germany even moved to Britain this autumn because they had no yarn to spin, so the current agreement is, to a great extent, Germany's only option. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Anglo-German debt and trade negotiations were completed today. The agreement reached will be named the "Payment Treaty," and the remaining clauses are as follows: "(1) Germany designates 55% of the value of its exports to be deposited in Britain to pay for the price of British goods entering Germany. (2) Germany issues foreign currency securities to pay for British goods entering Germany. If, after a one-month trial, practical difficulties are encountered, Germany may consult with Britain to amend this. Furthermore, Germany will not restrict the import of British coal, coke, cotton yarn, cotton fabrics, etc. (3) Germany agrees to pay Britain £400,000 in cash upon signing the treaty to settle the second phase of old debts. (4) The British side collects German accounts to prepare for the settlement of German old debts. (5) Within one year, Germany should deposit in Britain the remaining 45% of the value of its exports to Britain to settle the remaining debts owed to Britain. (6) Germany should pay in full the interest on the Dawes and Young bonds owed to British citizens. (7) If this treaty is violated, the Clearing Office will act as agent. This treaty may be cancelled by either party with one month's notice to the other party." (1st National Telegram)</p>

<h3>U.S. Secretary of State Announces the Abandonment of High Tariff Policies</h3>
<p>Moving Towards Free International Trade</p>
<p>[New York] At today's meeting of the National Foreign Trade Council, a letter from Secretary of State Hull was read, stating that the United States is now prepared to abolish its previous high-tariff policies and move towards a more liberal international trade path. The United States now invites other countries to join the effort to eliminate the harm of high tariffs. The impact of the 1930 tariff act has only caused countries to close their doors and reject American goods. We now acknowledge that exports paid for with loans are merely gifts to foreign countries. At the same time, President Roosevelt has sent a telegram to Mr. Farrell, the chairman of the National Foreign Trade Council, stating that we now want to find ways to restore international trade that benefit all countries, not just one. One of the biggest causes of commercial stagnation is the artificial barriers that hinder the exchange of goods. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>U.S. Treasury Deficit of 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Sharp Increase in Gold Imports</p>
<p>[Washington] The Treasury Department announced today that the financial deficit for this fiscal year has reached a huge sum of 100 million yuan. The government's total revenue is 1,208,184,666 yuan, while expenditures are 2,234,973,664 yuan, resulting in a deficit of 1,026,788,998 yuan. The deficit for the same period last year was only 481,906,629 yuan. Revenue is approximately 10,000,000 yuan less than the budget. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] The U.S. government deficit for this fiscal year exceeds 1,000,000,000 U.S. dollars. It was learned today that expenditures exceed income by a total of 1,026,788,000 U.S. dollars. Gold revenue exceeds 2,000,000 U.S. dollars, bringing the total value of gold stored in the Treasury to 8,001,062,000 U.S. dollars. The Treasury's gold value exceeding 8,000,000,000 U.S. dollars is a first. Emergency expenditures for this fiscal year total 1,105,872,000 U.S. dollars, and regular expenditures total 1,129,101,000 U.S. dollars. Revenue totals 1,208,184,000 U.S. dollars. The number of silver certificates issued this fiscal year to pay for silver purchased by the Treasury under the Silver Purchase Act has increased, exceeding 500,000,000 U.S. dollars, which is due to the issuance of silver certificates to offset the value of silver previously stored in the U.S. Treasury. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] According to today's gazette, gold imports to the United States increased sharply in October compared to September. Gold imports in October were valued at 6,850,000 U.S. dollars, while in September they were 15,600 U.S. dollars. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] The U.S. National Foreign Trade Council met here today. Mr. Li, the president of the New York Chinese Chamber of Commerce, said in a speech that China has no preconceived notions about the level of silver prices, but opposes price fluctuations, which make China's foreign exchange rates as volatile as a football being kicked around. In previous years, China opposed the world abandoning silver for gold, and now opposes restoring silver. The reason for both is that China's foreign trade does not suffer losses due to unstable silver prices. Currently, China's silver export tax has the same effect as prohibiting exports. However, it is hoped that after the situation improves in the future, China will not need to control its exchange rates like other countries. Secretary of State Hull also gave a speech, stating that domestic unemployment can only be reduced and the previous standard of living can only be restored after American exports are unhindered.

<h3>French Military Threat to the Saar; Germany Sees Danger as Playing with Fire</h3>
<p>All Germans See French Action as a Challenge to Germany</p>
<p>German Press Warns Britain to Share Responsibility</p>
<p>Britain Expresses Caution on the Saar Issue</p>
<p>[Berlin] The news that France is preparing to send troops to the Saar border to prevent German interference in the election has aroused deep resentment throughout Germany. The German press firmly denies that the National Socialist Party intends to cause trouble in the Saar and accuses France of aiming to manipulate the upcoming plebiscite. The German press hopes that Britain will resolutely refuse to participate in any invasion of the Saar. An unofficial diplomatic dispatch warns Britain that if France sends troops into the Saar, Britain should also be responsible for the consequences. The Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to meet on November 21st to study the issue of the Saar plebiscite.</p>
<p>According to responsible sources in Paris, if Mr. Knox, the chairman of the Saar Governing Commission appointed by the League of Nations, issues a warning stating that the local constabulary cannot restrain the activities of the National Socialist Party, then the motorized units of the French army stationed in the Alsace region can immediately enter the Saar. It is estimated that several thousand soldiers could control the situation within half a day. However, France has no intention of using force. This warning is issued to eliminate the need to use force. Even if troops are deployed, they will not be used to manipulate the vote. Once order is restored, the deployed troops must be withdrawn. The above are the opinions of people in Paris.</p>
<p>A key figure in Berlin expressed his opinion to a Reuters reporter, saying that France is currently playing with fire. If powerful forces attempt to use their military force to influence the plebiscite on January 13th, then the peace and order of the Saar cannot be maintained under any circumstances. Today's editorial in a German government newspaper indirectly criticizes the Saar Governing Commission for biased behavior, saying that France is now preparing to occupy the Saar with force whenever the Governing Commission deems it feasible. However, no matter what the reason, occupying the Saar is an act of defiance against Germany and an act of seizing land under the administration of the League of Nations. The world will condemn it, and those who tolerate such actions will not escape blame.</p>
<p>At the same time, French newspapers are spreading rumors about how strong the German military is. According to one French newspaper, the German military next spring will be even larger than the German military during World War I in 1924. Le Matin in Paris states that the German army numerically outnumbers the French army. Behind Hitler are two million fully armed soldiers with tanks, heavy artillery, and aircraft. As war rumors increase, the French people fear air raids because air forces are the most terrifying of the lethal weapons for killing and destroying houses invented after the Great War.

<p>[London] The British government is closely monitoring the maintenance of order during the Saar plebiscite and the threat of French military intervention. As a signatory to the Treaty of Versailles, the British government is deeply concerned that the plebiscite be held fairly and without any pressure and believes that the League of Nations is now taking appropriate precautions to ensure the realization of this goal. France's attitude is certainly good, but the British government believes that if all parties in the Saar do not lose their sense of responsibility, France's concerns may not materialize. At the same time, Britain does not want to take any special actions at present. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>

However, there are still four puppet police officers in North Pass who inspect departing passengers. (1st)</p>

<h3>Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>American Cotton: American farmers advocate reducing import barriers rather than suppressing prices to revitalize American exports. Secretary of State Hull also proposed to support this policy, which had a positive impact on the cotton market this morning, with prices rising by about 7 points. Activity in the near-term was not expected at the opening, but trading firms bought in the morning, and brokers also made some purchases, so the near-term received support. Critics expressed the opinion that a kind of restriction is necessary, but it should be done separately from the Peng Hai case. However, some also said that the existing contracts allow contractors to grow at least 25 percent more cotton than allowed in 1934.</p>

Others say it will be gradually reduced, first by 27.5 percent for three months and then by 32.5 percent for the next three months. The Rubber Committee is scheduled to convene on November 7th, and the results of its meeting are of great interest to people in the rubber industry.</p>
<p>New York: The New York rubber market opened this morning, showing sympathy for the London market, up 47 points. The market price continued to rise in the morning, with a very stable sentiment and a strong position.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Gold worth two million US dollars in New York and Paris was shipped to the United States, and more is expected to be shipped, causing gold coins to weaken. This morning, people in the New York securities market were paying close attention to this. The factors favoring the market before the opening included: (1) important long positions were closed, but there was still a lack of impetus, and (2) Ford's business report attracted general attention, but it did not have much impact on the market. The unfavorable factors for the market situation included: (1) railway stocks were under pressure, and (2) government bonds were weak. The securities market opened stably this morning, and although there was not much rise, it seemed to have improved slightly. However, a sustained upward trend is not guaranteed at the moment. The various market prices of New York securities are as follows:</p>

<h3>The Current Situation in Japan Before and After the Opening of the London Naval Preparatory Conference (Japanese Communication)</h3>
<p>Concentrating Political Forces, Mobilizing National Public Opinion</p>
<p>Opening the Door to Britain, No Concessions to the United States</p>
<p>At the first meeting of the London Naval Preparatory Conference, the most important thing was for Britain and the United States to reach an understanding first, and then seek a compromise between Britain, the United States, and Japan. If conference diplomacy prevails, the confrontation between Britain and the United States will not be too sharp, as in the past Washington Conference in 1922. An understanding between Britain and the United States is possible. However, the current global economic panic has not truly reached its bottom. The reason why Britain is struggling to support itself and maintain market prosperity is, firstly, that it relies on its vast colonies and self-governing territories to vigorously implement the economic alliance within the British Empire, and secondly, that Britain took the lead in abandoning the gold standard, stabilizing its markets in South America and Europe.</p>
<p>However, the United States is still Britain's biggest economic rival. The competition between North and South America cannot be eased, and it has no room for mediation in the opposition between European and Asian markets. In addition, the competition for oil and the competition in heavy industry have affected diplomatic relations and naval forces, which have serious foreign characteristics. Japan has done a lot of research on this and knows that Britain and the United States will never reach an understanding on naval disarmament unless they have no other choice, and they cannot unite against Japan. Therefore, when the preparatory conference first opened in June of this year, Britain sent the Prime Minister and the Naval Minister, while the United States sent Davis, a skilled diplomat from the Democratic Party who was familiar with the situation in Europe but did not hold the title of Ambassador, to engage in future disarmament negotiations. However, Japan did not send any important officials at the time, and even the people sent by the Navy were slow to act. Until the British-American consultations stalled, Japan was still using ordinary diplomatic methods to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>On the surface, it seems that Japan was not prepared to respond to the naval preparatory conference with an active approach, and was clinging to its isolated diplomacy. But in fact, this was not the case. It understood that an understanding between Britain and the United States would not succeed, or at least would be difficult to achieve. It still had room to plan, so it specially summoned the ambassadors to the United States, France, and Italy back to the country to prepare for a total diplomatic mobilization. At the same time, the general public in the country was probably indulging in entertainment in the cities, and even if strong stimulants were injected, the reaction was still very small. Moreover, the spread of left-leaning ideas was very frightening. As for the capitalists, they tried their best to seek the safety of investment and were unwilling to take more risks. Therefore, the tune of the extraordinary period, even if sung loudly, was not very realistic after all. It was not easy to deal with both the army and the navy. Moreover, issuing public bonds and advocating an extraordinary period were not permanent solutions after all. Therefore, it wanted to stimulate its people, mobilize national public opinion, and promote the so-called national unity, uniting all parties under the leadership of the military to attend the arms reduction conference.</p>
<p>If Britain and the United States really unite to share the hegemony of the Pacific Ocean, then Japan's position will be very difficult. However, Britain and Japan have had an alliance relationship in the past, and there is still a possibility of understanding in politics now. There are many places where they need each other, and there are also many occasions for mutual use. The difficulty lies in the economic competition, especially in the cotton market, which is Britain's only real rival. Britain will never easily make concessions on this issue, and Japan also sees it as a matter of life and death for its industrial circles, and will fight to the death to compete. However, there is plenty of antagonism between them. If this antagonism is allowed to expand, then the political understanding between the United States and Japan will become illusory. On the eve of the arms reduction conference, Japan is of course particularly vigilant. It uses "open door" as bait to lure Britain, seeking temporary economic benefits in exchange for political understanding at the naval disarmament conference. If Japan's demand for naval equality is agreed to by Britain, then Japan's claim can be continued.</p>
<p>The opposition of the United States is of course to be expected. However, after the British-Japanese understanding, the situation on the conference table will be different. If Japan's proposal is established, then the principle of equality will be confirmed. Either Britain and the United States reduce their current strength, or Japan expands its armaments. This is in line with military requirements and is beneficial to Japan. Otherwise, the conference will break down. According to Japan's wishes, the United States is responsible for the breakdown. Future arms races also seem to be initiated by the United States. Whether in international diplomacy or to the domestic people, Japan can cleverly explain this and forge its plan for military expansion. (October 25, Tokyo)</p>
<p>Northwest Inspection Notes</p>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>A Tragedy of Selling Children in Disguise</p>
<p>Weidiebao is a large town in Linze (Fu Yi) County. The residents used to have more than 1,000 households. After repeated wars and disasters, the old died, the strong fled, and now there are only 600 or 700 households. The grain tax of the escaped households is borne by the households that have not escaped, so the suffering is even deeper, and more and more people continue to flee. In recent years, the drought has meant that cultivation is only 50% of normal, so although the county seat is adjacent to areas with a good harvest, the prices in the fort have not fallen. Farmers lack funds and are unable to sow. Even if they offer free labor, no one dares to respond. Therefore, although the year of the great drought in Longxi has passed, the hidden pain felt by the farmers is still increasing. It is still common to see the tragedy of women under the age of 20 being sold to others as wives, maids, or child brides for a standard price of one yuan per year, and I am afraid that this is not unique to one place.</p>
<p>I was strolling outside the Cheshupu Inn in the evening when I suddenly heard a painful cry coming from an alley. I went to see what was happening and saw a man over 40 years old dragging a girl by the foot, scraping her along the ground. There was also a younger boy carrying a pair of red cloth shoes, crying and following along. I quickly stopped him and asked what was going on. I learned that the girl was already a child bride, but she had run away because of abuse and did not want to return. Her father was now forcing her to go back. The girl was only 14 years old, and I couldn't bear to see her like this, so I asked her father to postpone sending her back. He replied, "A married daughter is like a cow or horse that has been sold. What's there to say? Besides, I used two silver dollars and two shi of wheat from her father-in-law a few days ago. Alas, this little thief doesn't even try to earn face for her parents!" I asked, "Did you just give your daughter away after receiving this little bit of silver and wheat?" He replied, "No, I received 14 silver dollars from them before, because she is only 14 years old." At this time, the girl was still crying with her head in her hands. After much persuasion, she finally agreed to return, but she did not want her father to send her, but wanted her uncle to send her. However, according to her father, her uncle had already rejected her request. The reporter was willing to persuade him to go, and the boy carrying the shoes (the girl's brother) led me to her home. Her uncle replied angrily, "I won't send her. Let him (referring to the girl's father) beat her and send her himself. At that time, my sister (referring to the girl's mother) and I said that even if we had to beg for food, we would not want to give our daughter to someone as a child bride. Who told him not to listen?" A woman suddenly turned out from behind the door, her clothes ragged and her face full of tears. She seemed to want to say something, but she couldn't cry out. I asked her and learned that she was the girl's mother. In the end, she said hesitatingly, "Uncle, for the sake of this old boss (referring to the reporter), please send her back one more time." He finally agreed to go to the girl's place, ordered her to go back and wash up, and only when the sun was setting and her uncle urged her did the girl reluctantly come out of the house, tearfully departing. Later, her father, wanting to explain the reason for his cruel sale of his daughter, took out a stack of old and new slips of paper and said, "Commissioner (also called reporter), I am not afraid that you will harm us. Please take a look at these things, and you will understand our suffering." I took the slips and saw that they were all donation notices about three inches long and eight fen wide, with a total of 27 slips in one year. Each slip also had several donation items written on it. In addition to the fixed amount of surcharges on land taxes every year, and the maintenance of local security by the stationed troops, with the people enjoying the right to protection, and the establishment of supply depots to provide grain and miscellaneous supplies not included, there were also "fines for tobacco land" for which donation notices had already arrived before the tobacco had been sown. Farmers were not merchants and had no buying or selling to speak of, except for the tragedy of selling sons and daughters. There was also the "stamp tax donation" that had to be paid monthly (each county in Longxi should pay 300 to 500 stamp tax per month, but Linze is a poor county and pays 160 yuan per month. The county government obtains tax tickets from the provincial bureau and distributes them to various districts and townships regardless of whether the farmers use them or not. The farmers have already paid the stamp tax monthly, but when they need to use marriage certificates, land deeds, etc. and should affix stamps, they have to prepare cash again and buy them from places where stamps are stockpiled, which is also inexplicable), "welcome and hospitality fees" for officials from certain agencies (from the Financial Department and the court to the county government bureau districts) who came to collect money, and "temporary miscellaneous fees" such as gifts, telegrams, subsidies, and photographs for the establishment of certain associations or institutes (although taking photos is a small matter, photographers in remote counties and townships set very high prices, such as at least 12 yuan or 16 yuan for an 8-inch or 12-inch photo, plus the parties involved taking the opportunity to extort, so one notice could cost at least one Yuan head from hundreds of households), and "divine donations and ghost taxes" for welcoming gods and holding temple fairs and praying for rain or clearing skies (this is because among the donation notices, there are several items such as "publicly agreed to offer a fairy maiden opera for ten days, half a unit should pay 12,000 wen, 5 jin of dry noodles," "each unit is publicly assigned four lamps and stoves (?), one lamp planter for one day, bring clear oil," "publicly agreed to set up an altar in the small temple to pray for rain, each unit should pay 6,000 wen for incense, each sincerely offer clear oil and dry noodles," so they are named divine donations and ghost taxes). Now that the local officials can all sympathize with the people's plight and are determined to reduce the burden on the people, they should thoroughly investigate in detail, and those that should be reduced should be reduced as much as possible (such as tobacco land and stamp tax), and those that should be prohibited should be strictly prohibited (such as miscellaneous fees and superstitions), so that the almost extinct lives of the people may have a glimmer of hope for recovery.</p>
<p>After returning the donation slips that I had read to the owner, I saw the woman holding a broom, sweeping the courtyard clean, first setting up five bowls and chopsticks and a plate of blue salt (there is a salt lake nearby, each liter weighs six or seven jin and sells for only one jiao of silver), and then taking out a large earthenware basin filled with thin porridge of millet, with a long-handled wooden spoon floating on top, and calling her children to drink on the ground (there was more soup than porridge, so it was called drinking). The woman had a niece who was already of marriageable age. She was also present at the time, with bright teeth and eyes, and was like a young lady from a modest family. Her sleeves were torn and her arms were completely exposed. At first glance, one would not suspect that she was a modern girl wearing a swimsuit and about to try bathing, but unfortunately, she was born in an economically bankrupt rural area and would never be able to see the backs of rich women in the city. Only at this moment did she lower her head and drink porridge, looking extremely embarrassed. It was inconvenient for the reporter to talk any further, so I bid farewell and returned to the inn, silently reciting the line "behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, there are those who freeze to death" incessantly. There were also wild barks coming from the rooftops. Looking up at the dog cages, many were placed on the roofs, which was also an innovation here.</p>

<p>Bao Yueqing, the representative of the Mongolian Political Committee stationed in Peiping, previously received a telegram from Yun Wang and De Wang on the 26th, ordering him to welcome Chairman Chiang to Mongolia for guidance. At that time, Chiang was admitted to the hospital for a physical examination and it was inconvenient to visit him. Now that Chiang has been discharged from the hospital, he went to the headquarters at 9:10 a.m. today (1st) to meet him. Chiang received him in person. Bao first reported on the recent situation of the affairs of the Mongolian Political Committee and the situation in the Mongolian region. Then, he stated Yun and De Wang's sincere intention to welcome Chiang to Mongolia. Bao left at 10:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Visiting Huang Fu</p>
<p>After visiting Chiang Kai-shek, Bao, together with Bao Weihan, Meng He Batur, and Liang Zhixiang, representatives of the Mongolian Association in Peiping, went to the Political Consolidation Committee to visit Huang Fu at 10:30 a.m. He Qi Gong, the Secretary-General, received them on his behalf. Bao first stated the course of Han Fenglin's disappearance, and the sincere hope of the Mongolian Political Committee and the Mongolian Association in Peiping that the authorities would quickly find him. He also requested the Political Consolidation Committee to order the Peiping Municipal Authorities to be responsible for the search, and finally requested that the safety of the Mongolians residing in the interior be guaranteed in the future. He Qi Gong replied (1) Regarding the Han case, a submission was received from the Mongolian Association requesting assistance in the search. The Peiping Municipal Government has been ordered to transfer it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. The results have not yet been reported and will be urged to expedite the matter. (2) The safety of the Mongolians can be absolutely guaranteed. (3) In the future, if there are any problems on the Mongolian side, representatives can be sent by the association, or written contact can be made with the Political Consolidation Committee, which will be responsible for handling them. Bao and others were very satisfied and left at around 11:00 a.m. (1st)</p>
<h3>Rebuilding the Luan River Railway Bridge on the Peiping-Liaoning Railway</h3>
<p>Materials Have Been Purchased from Britain</p>
<p>The Construction Period is Scheduled for Three Years</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The insurance period of the Luan River Great Iron Bridge on the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, 30 years, has long expired. The Railway Bureau has long planned to rebuild it, but due to the fact that North China has been plagued by events for many years, and that the section outside the pass has been forcibly cut off by the puppet state, the income is not as good as before. Therefore, it has been repeatedly stopped due to the lack of funds and the surrounding environment. This spring, the engineer of the Bureau inspected the bridge body and found that it was already leaning, and the bridge deck also had many cracks. Vehicles traveling to and fro had to change to a speed of no more than 15 miles per hour. However, it was still difficult to avoid danger, so the report was given to the Railway. After passing the Bureau Affairs Meeting, it was decided to save money from the Railway's surplus and raise 1 to 2 million Yuan over three years to rebuild it, widen the bridge deck, and change it to double tracks, so that traffic to and fro would not be delayed. The Bureau submitted it to the Ministry of Railways for approval and then started purchasing materials from various steel factories in Britain. It was originally planned to start construction next spring, but it was reported that the water level of the Luan River rose sharply this summer, and the bridge foundation was stirred up, becoming more and more tilted. In addition, the riverbed collapsed and the bridge body sank. It was even more dangerous for high-speed trains and freight trains to pass through. Therefore, the Bureau decided to advance the construction and telegraphed the British factory to expedite the delivery of materials. As of the 15th of this month, a part of the materials had been transported to Qinhuangdao and transferred to the side of the Luan River Railway Bridge for stacking. After the Engineering Office of the Railway Bureau sent personnel to inspect and accept them, it ordered engineers to lead hundreds of ironworkers and carpenters to take a special train to the east bank of Wanhe on the 26th of this month to build a temporary workshop and start work, building a new bridge next to the old bridge. Before the new bridge is completed, the old bridge will be repaired to avoid danger. The construction period is estimated to be three years, but if there is no problem with the funds, it can also be shortened to one and a half years.</p>
<p>It currently takes 18 hours and 50 minutes to travel to and from Guanwai. The Japanese side recently asked the Peiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau to open a special express train to shorten the travel time to 17 hours. The Railway Bureau has approved the Japanese side's request and plans to revise and implement it around November 15th. Only the time will be shortened compared to before, and the other methods will remain the same. The outside world previously rumored that a special express train would be added to the Peiping-Luan traffic, which was a misunderstanding of this matter. All trains on the Peiping-Liaoning Railway are also planned to shorten the time in the short term, so that each train can reach its destination faster. Although this has been planned recently, due to the fact that the roadbed has been in disrepair for a long time and that half of the sleepers are rotted, the materials and funds involved are quite large. Therefore, the Peiping-Tianjin section will be renovated first, and then the trunk line will be extended. (October 31st)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Finance Department Procures Grain for the Guiding the Huai River Project</h3>
<p>The Agricultural Bank of China is Entrusted to Send Personnel to Shanghai to Purchase</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The project of guiding the Huai River into the sea started on the 1st, and the system of conscripted labor is completely adopted. There are 160,000 workers from 12 counties including Huaiyin. As for food, which is necessary for the workers' lives, about 2,000 dan of rice or 200,000 jin of flour are consumed every day. The Provincial Government has issued an order to the relevant counties, informing the merchants to supply them at flat prices as much as possible, and also entrusted the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank to purchase crude wood and various kinds of third- and fourth-class flour, corn, and sorghum. According to Chief Xue, Director of General Affairs of the Provincial Farmers Bank, the Agricultural Bank is actively rushing to handle the purchase of rice and flour entrusted by the Provincial Government this time. Therefore, Vice-President Hou made a special trip to Shanghai a few days ago to contact the Agricultural Products Marketing Office of the Bank to discuss all the progress of purchasing rice flour and other items. Now Mr. Hou is in Shanghai, and it is likely that he has properly negotiated with the major flour mills in Shanghai. The number of purchases is not yet clear at this time, and it will be announced after Mr. Hou returns to Zhenjiang. He will return to the province no later than tomorrow (2nd). In order to actively handle the purchase of food, the Bank plans to send personnel to Wuhu in the next few days to contact the purchase of food. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Rongchang Match Factory Suspends Production</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The match industry in Tianjin has been flourishing since the beginning of the Republic of China. The manufacturers operated by Chinese businessmen include the Beiyang, Danhua, and Rongchang factories. The manufacturers operated by Japanese businessmen include the Daisheng and Sanyou factories. This spring, the Ministry of Finance increased the unified match tax. The three factories operated by Chinese businessmen have suffered losses and cannot bear the increased burden. They have jointly appealed to the match industry in Shandong Province to ask the Ministry of Finance to reduce or exempt the unified tax, but this has not been approved. At that time, the three factories in Tianjin once stopped production to express their firm attitude. Later, at the request of the workers, and with the mediation of the Party and government authorities, the entire factory resumed production and勉維艱局 (struggled to maintain the difficult situation). However, the business of each factory was affected by this blow, and it fell into a slump. Recently, due to the excessively high unified tax and high costs, especially under the special circumstances in Tianjin, Japanese merchants have tried to smuggle and sell a large number of counterfeit matches without paying taxes. Not only the sales outlets have been completely blocked, making it impossible to compete with Japanese merchants, but also the inventories have been piling up, making losses unbearable. On October 6th of this year, the Rongchang Fire Factory decided at a shareholders' meeting that due to slow sales and the combustibility of matches, the inventory in the warehouse had become extremely dangerous after a long time. The factory reported to the Party and government authorities to approve the official suspension of production in order to clear the inventory and reorganize the factory. However, the Party and government authorities believed that if the 2,500 workers of the factory were to lose their jobs once, not only would their lives be unsustainable, but also the order of Tianjin would be worrisome during this time of tight winter defense. Therefore, Ma Liang, a member of the Party Department, and Deng Qinglan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened both labor and management of the factory to discuss ways to maintain operations and informed them of the pros and cons. After several consultations over the past ten days, the factory's attitude was resolute, and the suspension of production was inevitable, resulting in ineffective consultation. The Party and government authorities only supervised the factory to implement the conditional dismissal of workers. The method has been signed by representatives of both labor and management within this month. The dismissal procedures will be completed by the end of this month. The factory's property has been locked up by creditors and has begun to handle liquidation procedures. It is also heard that after Rongchang stops production, the other two factories operated by Chinese businessmen also have unstable news. The match industry in Tianjin is likely to go bankrupt from now on, and there will be no more domestically produced matches in North China. At the same time, at a time when the match industry in Tianjin is precarious, Japanese merchants are planning to invest in establishing a large-scale match factory, taking advantage of the opportunity of Rongchang's suspension of production to invest in dumping and infringing on the domestic market. If this matter is indeed realized, then the domestic match industry in North China will be completely bankrupt. (October 30th, Wang Shijun, our newspaper's correspondence student)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Falsely Claiming to be a Communist Party Member and Requesting Self-Renewal</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the County previously received a local person, Lu Fengkang, who claimed to be a Communist Party member and requested self-renewal, confessing that he had committed robbery and other acts, and now he had repented, earnestly requesting to be allowed to renew himself. The committee followed the usual procedures, sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, and at the same time instructed them to wait for verification and handling on file. It was reported that the committee recently found that Lu Fengkang was not a Communist Party member at all, and dared to falsely claim to be applying for self-renewal, obviously using the opportunity of self-renewal to try to evade responsibility for his crimes, which was extremely cunning. It was appropriate to send a letter to the County Government, requesting the County Court to order the arrest of the criminal for investigation and prosecution in order to warn against cunning.</p>
<p>Security Team Live Ammunition Shooting</p>
<p>In order to enhance the academic and technical skills of the students in the third district squad leader training class of the Provincial Security Team, live ammunition shooting will be held every Friday and Saturday from today (2nd) until the end of this month, a total of four times and eight days.

<p>New Education Director Takes Office</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaosheng, Director of the Education Bureau of this county, applied for resignation and was approved by the Education Department. After deliberation at the Provincial Government Conference, Shen Lianbi was appointed to succeed him. Mr. Shen is well-known in the education sector for his knowledge and experience. Now that he has been appointed, the education sector in Songyi will definitely be more colorful. Mr. Shen took office yesterday, and all the staff in the bureau remained in their positions in order to be familiar with the situation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Autumn Harvest Assessment Rejected by the Province</p>
<p>Kunshan suffered a severe drought this year, with a total of 111,708 mu of farmland in the county yielding no harvest. However, the autumn assessment of the harvest was set at 8.785, which was rejected by the province after the county submitted it for review, and an order was issued to increase it slightly. At 2:00 p.m. on the 1st, the County Government convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies and district chiefs to discuss the results. It was decided that the district offices and public organizations would telegraph the province, listing the reasons why the autumn harvest could not be slightly increased, and that Cai Wu, Jie Lin, Gui Shen, Yan Huading, Zhu Wenyuan, and Dai Juong would be designated as representatives to go to the province on the 5th to fight for it.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Meili Murder Case: Suspension of Request for Inspection</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Meili Public Security Bureau sent four policemen to Zhou Bingfu's house in West Street to arrest a sorcerer. However, due to the great momentum, Zhou's 16-year-old sick daughter, Zhou Yueqin, was frightened to death. At that time, the whole township was in an uproar, and the people blamed the Public Security Bureau. The Bureau immediately sent the responsible police officers, Ding Zheng and others, to the General Bureau for custody pending investigation. The family of the deceased was suing the County Government, but Director Zhou handed the responsible four policemen over to the judiciary for review, posted bail, and sent them back to the original bureau to temporarily maintain their duties. Now, because the woman's abdomen was only enlarged after being frightened to death, and there were no other special signs, the family of the deceased suspended the request for inspection by the county and filed a complaint for negligent homicide. The body was already buried by the family on the afternoon of the 30th. It is said that a private settlement has been reached.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Wang Shaoyou Comes to Suzhou to Investigate Land</p>

<p>Four Garrison Zones Divided During Winter Defense Period</p>
<p>Magistrate Wu believes that this county is adjacent to Taihu Lake and has a flourishing commercial market. For this year's winter defense, he has specially divided the area into four garrison zones as follows: (1) Inside and outside the city; (2) Part of the City Temple, and Bendu, Guangfu, Panguan, Hengjing, Dongshan, and Xishan; (3) Huangdai, Xiangcheng, and Weiting; (4) Chefang, Xietang, Zaizhi, and Zhouzhuang. The county magistrate will serve as the overall commander, and the police and security teams from each township will be responsible for garrisoning. When necessary, they may request assistance from local troops.</p>
<p>Su-Mu and Su-Chang Roads to Open to Traffic Next Spring</p>
<p>The Su-Mu Road from Suzhou City to Mudu is now under construction, and the roadbed of the Su-Chang Road from Suzhou to Changshu has also been fully completed. Both roads are expected to be open to traffic in February next year.

<p>Telegraph and Telephone Bureaus Merged</p>
<p>The Suzhou Telegraph Bureau and the Telephone Bureau have been merged to form the Wu County Telegraph Bureau.

Director Niu is also working on telephone services in various townships, and telephone service to Huxuguan will be available by the end of this year.</p>
<p>District Chiefs Resolutely Resign</p>
<p>The autonomous region of Wu County was originally divided into 23 districts, but it has now been reorganized into 13 districts. As a result, the area of each district has been expanded, and the operating funds for the shipping industry have been reduced by two-thirds. Furthermore, they have been ordered to handle the baojia system. The district chiefs feel that it is difficult to handle affairs, so Wu Erchang, district chief of the first district, Wang Deshou, district chief of the second district, Zhu Shanqing, district chief of the sixth district, and Zhang Hong, district chief of the ninth district, have all submitted their resignations. Although County Magistrate Wu has earnestly tried to persuade them to stay, the district chiefs have continued to submit their resignations due to lack of funds, and have resolutely resigned.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>It is Not Easy to Eradicate the Pirates of Lvsi</p>
<p>Recently, six pirate ships suddenly appeared off the coast of Lvsi, with more than 100 pirates. They robbed fishermen, kidnapped people for ransom, and committed all kinds of evils. The entire 13th Brigade of the Water Police set off the day before yesterday to encircle and suppress them. Peng Xiaochao, chief of staff of the Nantong District Command, was also invited to Lvsi to direct the operation. Yesterday (the 31st) afternoon, he came from Lvsi to Haimen and met with County Magistrate Chen, giving detailed instructions on the county's coastal defense. According to Peng, the pirates of Lvsi have been somewhat suppressed after being attacked by the police and militia, but they are constantly moving around, making it difficult to eradicate them completely in the short term. Peng then returned to Nantong by the same vehicle.</p>
<p>Shen Chujiang's Son Released After Being Kidnapped</p>
<p>Wu Bao, the 11-year-old son of Shen Chujiang, a wealthy household in Liuzhou Township, Fourth District, was kidnapped by bandits on the 24th day of the first month of the lunar calendar this year and a ransom of 10,000 yuan was demanded. After Shen reported the case to the county government, the police were ordered to arrest the suspects Lu Zaming and Jin Zigao. After repeated interrogations, there was no clue. The day before yesterday (the 28th), Wu Bao suddenly returned home. According to him, he was moved several times after being kidnapped and was now released. A bandit escorted him to the east of Sanyang Town in the Fourth District and left. The bandit had a letter for Wu Bao to bring back, stating that they should immediately compensate for the loss of 600 yuan, otherwise they would be in serious trouble later. Yesterday (the 31st), Shen presented the letter to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>

Recently, the survey team moved to Baohua Nunnery, west of Baojie Changqiao, to survey the mountainous fields in Qingqi Township. The work of surveying mountainous fields is more difficult than surveying flat fields. Yesterday, the district was completely surveyed. The team leader Huang Hui, the captain Zhou Houxi, and the land surveyor Tang Baoqi drew up maps and presented them to the provincial bureau, and then transferred to Gaochun for surveying. This is because the other districts of Xiyi will use aerial surveying.</p>
<p>County Government Schedules Winter Defense</p>

<h3>Pilots of Songhan District Petition Party and Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting a Stop to the Arbitrary Actions of the Pilotage Management Committee</p>
<p>Shipping Association Sends Letter to Minister Kong Stating Opinions</p>
<p>After the new rules of the China Pilotage Management Committee, Songhan District, were announced and implemented, the shipping companies decided to suspend shipping and telegraphed for appeals. The Songhan Pilotage Joint Petition Group petitioned the party and government agencies yesterday, and the Shipping Association sent a letter to Minister Kong stating the process. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Pilotage Petition</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Songhan Pilotage Joint Petition Group, due to the unresolved pilotage dispute, sent more than ten representatives, including Li Yushan, to the Municipal Government at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to petition Mayor Wu. Secretary Chen received them on behalf of the mayor. In addition to submitting a written petition, the group also made four points in person: (1) When China is recovering its navigation rights, pilotage is particularly important. Please pay attention to national sovereignty and do not allow customs officials to arbitrarily control it; (2) Our pilot colleagues have all served in the shipping industry for many years and have considerable experience and licenses, which cannot be compared with newcomers; (3) There are many dark secrets in the pilotage examination. The qualified personnel recruited are mostly selected based on personal bias and lack the ability to serve. The refusal of employment by various industry professionals can prove this; (4) Please, Mayor, prioritize national sovereignty and rescue our colleagues. Secretary Chen replied that the mayor expressed deep sympathy for the points in the petition and would immediately prepare a document to submit to the Central Government and consult the Ministry of Finance, the Navy, and the Ministry of Communications, etc. Afterwards, they went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to petition Director Wu. Wu was busy with official business and instructed Secretary Hu to receive them on his behalf, stating that all points in the petition could be remedied. Afterwards, they transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters at Fenglin Bridge, where Tian Zhou Dize received them and believed that the point raised by the group regarding the many dark secrets in the customs examination needed to be studied and planned to send personnel to the customs to investigate the truth of the examination in the coming days. Later, the group went to the Seamen's Special Party Headquarters, where Qian Zhaochang received them and believed that the seamen's profession was being devastated by foreigners without any guarantee, and decided to submit the matter to the Central Government for instructions.</p>
<p>Shipping Industry's Opinion</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, Qing Hede, chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, sent a letter to Minister of Finance Kong yesterday, stating: "Minister Yongzhi, I respectfully inform you that I recently read in the newspaper that you met with reporters and gave a speech, stating that shipping companies should not oppose the pilotage examination. I am deeply grateful for your concern for the shipping industry. However, the content of your speech seems to have some discrepancies with the actual situation of the shipping companies' appeal. I am afraid that it will cause misunderstandings. I would like to state this to you. The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association believes that the new Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee has greatly increased the pilotage rates for Chinese pilots in Songhan, which is unbearable. Therefore, after a collective discussion, it was decided to appeal to the Yuan and the Ministry to request a reduction. In recent years, the shipping industry has declined to the extreme. The Chinese shipping industry has already imposed a 30% tonnage tax to fund the merchant shipping school, and it has also increased its burden due to the establishment of the Shipping Administration Bureau. It is already struggling to maintain its current state. If the burden is further increased, it will be impossible. Since it concerns our own interests, we cannot remain silent. I hope you will understand our plight. As for the committee's screening of the national short-term pilots who have received licenses from the Ministry of the Navy, the shipping companies have not expressed any opposition. As you said, it is extremely important in relation to life and property. Life is valued by everyone, and ships are the only property of shipping companies. How can we not take care of them? Although we are foolish, we should also understand this. However, the examination conducted by the pilotage association this time is only for Chinese people and not for foreigners. Since there is no issue of sovereignty, and pilotage is different from driving, the most important thing is familiarity with the sea routes. Chinese pilots in Songhan mostly come from experience and have very few academics. Therefore, we also contribute our opinions that, during the examination, except for those who fail on their own or have diseases, service experience should be the prerequisite to maintain livelihoods. There is no fact of opposing the examination or screening. The documents are available for review. I also ask you to appreciate the original facts and give your support so that the truth can be revealed and the issue can be resolved. I sincerely pray for your success and wish you all the best."</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Redeems Songjiang Again</h3>
<p>Representatives of Various Industries Believe it is an Urgent Plan</p>
<p>Striving to Raise Funds Amidst a Depressed Market</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convened a second meeting of various industries at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss raising funds to dredge the Wusong River. Attendees included Wan Yongsheng and Wu Zhigeng from the shipping industry, Zhang Fengshou and Jin Yousong from the inland shipping industry, Wei Hongwen from the coal industry, Zheng Zenan from the sugar industry, Jiang Shizhi from the rice grain sales industry, Hong Weiguan from the Chinese cigarette factory industry, Gu Xin from the flour factory industry, Ju Zisheng from the bean and rice industry, Lu Wenshao from the rice shop industry, Pan Zhi from the fire machine ginning industry, Yu Zuoting, Ke Ganchen, Pan Xusheng, Fang Jiaobo, and Yan Esheng from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Chairman Yu Zuoting first reported the reasons for convening the meeting, followed by Pan Xusheng reporting on the two meetings he attended at the Municipal Government, and Fang Jiaobo reported on the previous dredging experience, and Yan Esheng reported on the documents between the Municipal Government and the Chamber of Commerce regarding the dredging matter. After the reports, the discussion began. The representatives of various industries present all believed that dredging the Wusong River was an urgent plan, but fundraising was difficult due to the depressed commercial market. It was proposed to request the Municipal Government to allocate as much funding as possible, and to send letters to the relevant industries to strive to deliberate in the face of no other options, with the goal of completing this task. A letter will also be sent to the Public Works Bureau requesting them to send a copy of the dredging plan and construction method.</p>
<h3>The Chief of the Shaanxi Construction Bureau, Lei Baohua, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Visiting Zhang Gongquan and Others to Discuss the Wei River Diversion Loan</p>
<p>A Formal Contract Can Be Signed Within Days</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Shaanxi Provincial Government, in order to carry out the Wei River Diversion Project, is specifically seeking a loan of 1.55 million yuan from banking circles in Shanghai. Yang Hucheng, the Director of Pacification of the province, had previously come to Shanghai to negotiate everything in person. The principles of the loan had already been largely agreed upon, with only a few details and methods of undertaking guarantees remaining to be negotiated and decided before a formal contract could be signed. The Shaanxi Provincial Government has specially sent Lei Baohua, the Chief of the Provincial Construction Bureau, to Shanghai again to negotiate. According to Shen Shi News Agency reporters, Lei arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Beijing and is staying at the Yangtze Hotel. Accompanying him are several officials from the bureau. After arriving in Shanghai, Lei separately visited Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China, Wu Yunzhai of the Jin Cheng Bank, and other leading figures in the banking industry to further discuss the Wei River Diversion Loan. The result was extremely satisfactory, and a formal contract can be signed within days, it is said.</p>
<h3>Plain Text Telegrams Will Not Be Translated Separately</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications previously issued an order to telegram offices across the country stating that, starting from November 1st, all Chinese plain text telegrams should be translated and sent uniformly. However, the Shanghai Telegraph Office, considering the psychology of the Shanghai business community, who are unwilling for telegrams to be translated to avoid leaking secrets and to prevent delays, has decided that, in order to respect the wishes of the recipients, starting from the day before yesterday, unless the recipient sends a letter requesting translation, all other telegrams will still be delivered in code and will not be translated separately.</p>

<h3>The General Association of Drivers Petitions the Ministry of Communications to Protest the Hong Kong Government's Examination of Chinese Ship Masters</h3>
<p>China Has Joined the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea</p>
<p>Certificates Issued by the Government Should Receive Equal Treatment</p>
<p>The new ships Hai Yuan, etc., of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, due to the Hong Kong authorities' insistence on examining Chinese ship masters, have resulted in the Hai Yuan employing foreign crew members. The Shanghai Commercial Ship Driving Association strongly disagrees with this and lodged a protest yesterday, which has been submitted to the Ministry of Communications, stating that for passenger ships sailing to Hong Kong, Chinese captains should not be subject to examination by the Hong Kong government in order to maintain international equality and uphold sovereignty. According to reports, the Si Hai ships ordered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in England are about to be completed one after another, and the Hai Yuan has already arrived in Shanghai. The company plans to have the Hai Yuan operate on the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangdong line and, it is said, intends to appoint foreigners as captains because the Hong Kong government requires Chinese captains to pass their examinations before being allowed to serve. China has already joined the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and should stand on an equal footing internationally. The captain's certificates issued by the Chinese government, having been recognized by the Chinese government as qualified to ensure safety at sea, should have the same effect as captain's certificates issued by other countries. If foreign commercial ships sailing to China have captain's certificates issued by their governments, China also recognizes them as qualified, and Chinese captains on commercial ships sailing abroad should receive equal treatment. This is a self-evident international reciprocal relationship. If the Hong Kong government recognizes the captain's certificates of other countries as valid but refuses to recognize the captain's certificates issued by the Chinese government, insisting on examination, it not only despises the Chinese nation but also has no basis in any convention. Could there be any greater inequality in treatment? If the governments of other countries follow this example and also examine Chinese captains on commercial ships sailing to various countries, the consequences for China's international shipping industry would be unimaginable, and the country's international standing would fall to an unknown degree. What national sovereignty would there be to speak of? The reason why Chinese captains should not be subject to examination by the Hong Kong government is not out of fear of difficulty or an attempt to avoid it but, from the standpoint of sovereignty, there is simply no need to be subjected to their examination. Furthermore, Chinese captains have been serving on commercial ships sailing to Hong Kong for many years, with ships such as the Shun Feng, Gong Ping, and Kun Xing all having achieved considerable success, demonstrating that the qualifications of Chinese captains are not inferior to those of other countries. Therefore, the Hong Kong government has no excuse not to recognize the certificates issued by the Chinese government. It is earnestly requested that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be consulted to make a reasoned argument and lodge a protest to maintain international equality and uphold sovereignty, which would be fortunate for the country. (Remainder omitted.) This petition was sent out yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Weinan Station on the Longhai Railway Opens Joint Passenger Transport Services</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented on December 1st</p>
<p>The Two Railways Received an Instruction from the Ministry of Railways Stating: "Regarding the Longhai Railway Administration's submission that the Weinan Station be designated as a joint passenger transport station from November 1st of this year, and that it collect parcel freight charges, along with a schedule of fares and distances, requesting approval for the record, it should be approved accordingly. However, fearing that the various railways may not be able to complete the printing of tickets in time, it is changed to be implemented from December 1st. In addition to issuing instructions and separate orders, a schedule of fares and distances for the Weinan Station is enclosed for compliance and reporting." The bureau has forwarded this order to the Traffic Department for compliance.</p>
<h3>The Banking Law Research Association Has Achieved Considerable Results</h3>
<p>Opinions Submitted by Banks in Shanghai and Other Cities</p>
<p>Ten Articles Are Planned to Be Submitted for Amendment</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Banking Law Research Committee organized by the Shanghai Banking Association has held several meetings to discuss and study the Banking Law. The Central News Agency reporter inquired about this with the committee yesterday morning. It was learned that the Banking Law regulations were promulgated in 1931, totaling fifty-two articles, but have not been implemented since their promulgation. At a time when the banking industry is extremely developed and social finance is extremely fearful, the Ministry of Finance authorities and leaders of the banking industry across the country deeply feel that the implementation of the Banking Law is urgent and cannot be delayed any longer. Banking colleagues believe that the previously promulgated Banking Law has shortcomings, and the Ministry of Finance authorities also fear that if the previously promulgated Banking Law is implemented suddenly, requests for amendments will inevitably arise. Therefore, they have exchanged views with the banking industry in advance and will amend and implement it to make it more complete. Thus, the Banking Law Research Committee was organized. The committee has held several meetings and has achieved considerable results. It still needs one or two more meetings before it can conclude its research, which is expected to be completed within this week. In order to gather the opinions of the banking industry across the country, the committee has notified banks in Shanghai and other cities separately to compile opinion letters and send them to the committee for research, and has set a deadline for banks in Shanghai to submit them within five days. Now that the deadline has passed, many opinion letters from various banks have been received. Due to the greater distances involved, not all submissions from other cities have been received yet. It is expected that responses from banks in Beiping, Tianjin, and other cities will arrive within days. After the committee receives all the opinion letters, it will compile and study them, and then submit them to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Banking Association. The Executive Committee will then convene a full meeting to discuss them in detail, and submit the results of the discussion to the Ministry of Finance for transmission to the Legislative Yuan for amendment and implementation of the previously promulgated Banking Law. The opinions of various bankers on amending the previously promulgated Banking Law have not yet reached the time for publication, but it is understood that ten articles of the previously promulgated fifty-two articles of the Banking Law are planned to be submitted for amendment.</p>
<h3>The Rent Reduction Association Held a Representatives' Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Demanding the Real Estate Association to Formulate Rent Reduction Measures</p>

Over a hundred representatives from various branch associations attended. Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Xianfang, Chen Jiufeng, Liu Zhongying, Wang Jingdong, and others were elected as the presidium.

(4) Motion on Organizing a Rent Reduction Appeal Team: Resolved, the general association will draft detailed measures and then organize it. (5) Motion on Organizing a Special Action Committee: Resolved, passed.</p>
<p>Representatives' Petition</p>
<p>After the meeting, the representatives organized themselves into teams and took letters to the Real Estate Association to petition, but the association stated that no one was in charge, and no results were obtained. The original letter stated: "Respected Sirs, our association held a representatives' meeting of branch associations today to discuss the case of promoting the implementation of rent reduction measures. It is believed that this case cannot be effective without the understanding of your association and jointly overcoming the difficulties of the times. It was resolved that all representatives should come forward to invite your association to jointly negotiate rent reduction measures face-to-face in order to relieve the people's difficulties and avoid disputes. This has been recorded. Accordingly, a case record is made and a letter is handed over to all representatives of the general meeting to bring forward, hoping that you will grant an audience and quickly formulate rent reduction measures, which would be most beneficial to the public. Sincerely, Shanghai Real Estate Association."</p>
<h3>All Member Banks of the Banking Association Have Complied with Regulations and Registered</h3>
<p>A Total of Thirty-Three, Including the Bank of China</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government, setting a deadline for all unregistered banks to register in accordance with the regulations, and ordered the Banking Association to refuse unregistered banks from joining the association, the Banking Association complied yesterday.

A total of thirty-three banks.</p>
<h3>The Banking Society Invited Yu Huan Cheng to Speak on the Silver Tax Problem</h3>
<p>Raise the Export Point of Silver and Suppress Outflow</p>
<p>The Fundamental Solution Lies in Controlling International Trade</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Banking Society invited Yu Huan Cheng, former Deputy Governor of the Bank of China, to speak on the "Minor Silver Tax Problem" at the Shanghai Banking Association's meeting hall on Hong Kong Road at 7 PM last night. Over a hundred bank members attended the lecture. Yu's main points were as follows: "Regarding the minor silver tax, I made this proposal four years ago in a speech at the Central News Agency. At that time, silver prices were falling sharply, and there were many silver imports, so I advocated a small import tax to maintain the equalization of our country's foreign exchange. Now that silver prices have risen, changing imports into exports, a small export tax is added. Although the matter is the opposite, the reason for equalizing foreign exchange rates is the same. The effect of adding a silver export tax is firstly to raise the export point of silver, which is sufficient to suppress the outflow of silver; secondly, to invisibly increase tariffs, making foreign exchange for imported goods firm and increasing their prices; and thirdly, to balance foreign exchange. Although foreign exchange has risen sharply after the increase, this is a temporary phenomenon. However, in our opinion, those who seek perfection in balancing foreign exchange should have an ideal standard for balancing foreign exchange. When prices rise and fall, the market should be balanced by buying and selling by the Equalization Committee, so that those engaged in international trade do not take great risks. Secondly, the equalization fund still needs to be increased, and various banks engaged in foreign exchange should be united to strengthen their strength. However, these are all stopgap measures. The fundamental solution is to eliminate the huge trade deficit in international trade, so that cash will not flow out. There are proposals to control exchange rates to save the trade deficit, and there are proposals to control trade. In China's current situation, seeking to control exchange rates is no less difficult than controlling trade, so I advocate the latter. However, there must be full preparation, and it is hoped that those with aspirations will engage in research."</p>
<h3>The Zhejiang Private Electricity Association Will Travel to Wenzhou on Schedule to Attend the Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>The 6th Annual Meeting of the Zhejiang Private Electricity Industry Association, located at 212 Shangjing Road, Shanghai, was originally scheduled to be held in early October, but was postponed by forty days due to inadequate preparations. It is now scheduled to be held in Wenzhou starting on November 10th. It is reported that all attending representatives and guests will gather in Shanghai on November 8th. The Puhua Electrical Company and the Dong'ou Telephone Company have specially sent Yang Yunong and Xu Zhongxian to Shanghai to receive the representatives and guests and take the Yili Company's Yili steamer departing for Wenzhou at 4 PM that afternoon. All cabin seat prices on the steamer will be calculated at a 30% discount for both round trips as a gesture of goodwill to the attending representatives. At the same time, domestic and foreign colleagues who sell electrical appliances and electrical appliance manufacturers have sent their products to the meeting for display and exhibition for publicity. Electrical appliance manufacturers in Shanghai, such as the Yizhong Company, will also provide security during the conference to express their welcome. The meeting schedule is three days. After the opening of the meeting, they will visit the local and Rui'an electrical industry and will be guided by the Puhua Company and others to visit scenic spots such as Dangshan Xianyan. It is reported that the Nanjing Construction Committee has specially sent Director Yun Yintang, and the Zhejiang Construction Department has specially sent Section Chief Wu Jingqing to attend and provide guidance.

<h3>The Ripple Effects of the "Elephant Shell" Case</h3>
<p>A Misunderstanding Occurred Between the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Firm and the National Medicine Association</p>
<p>The dispute between the Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association and the Dongjiang Fritillaria Sales Cooperative has lasted for a long time. Since Yu Zuoting, Zhang Shenzhi, Fang Jiaobo, and other gentlemen from the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Townsmen Association, and Secretary Wang of the Zhejiang Construction, took the initiative to mediate, an agreement was reached, and peace was restored, which was reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association issued a declaration because it read in a certain newspaper on the 27th of last month that it would "no longer rely on Shanghai pharmaceutical firms." The National Medicine Industry Association believed that the purpose of the mediation had been achieved, and the people would naturally benefit. There was no such clause as "no longer relying on Shanghai pharmaceutical firms for future purchases" in the agreement. It was actually a news misreport. Both sides responded in newspapers. Inquiries were made with important people who mediated the case. It was said that the procurement of elephant shells from various ports still followed the old practice, with Shanghai firms purchasing from Ningbo firms. No party had any objections. The report that it would not rely on Shanghai pharmaceutical firms was completely inaccurate. It has now been explained to both parties that the misunderstanding can be understood.</p>
<h3>The Railway Bureau Renovates Fourth-Class Passenger Cars</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau's Machinery Department recently renovated one of the existing fourth-class cars in accordance with the Vehicle Standards Conference resolution. It has now been completed. In the car, a row of transverse seats for two people each is set up in the middle, with long straight tables on both sides. There are a total of ninety-six seats. Luggage racks are also set up above the transverse seats, similar to those above the straight seats, for passengers to place luggage and belongings. The exterior of the car is painted with gold paint, and the interior is painted with improved paint. There are separate men's and women's toilets in the car, two electric ventilators, and the number of electric lights is also increased compared to before. All fourth-class passenger cars will be renovated accordingly in the future.</p>
<h3>Pan Hongsheng's Condition Is Critical</h3>
<p>Cai Tongde Pharmacy Donates Ginseng</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai All-Circles Assistance Patriotic Martyrs Committee previously bailed out the patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng from prison due to his critical illness, and he was treated at the Huajiang Chinese Medicine Hospital. Doctors such as Zai Cangchu on Pubai Road and Yang Yanhe on Diqi Road were subsequently added to the treatment team. The wet febrile disease, including symptoms such as self-muttering and abdominal pain, has been cured. However, no one was willing to be responsible for treating the pulmonary tuberculosis with cough and tidal fever. He has now returned home from the hospital and is seeking medical treatment on his own. Ginseng is used in all prescriptions. Pan's family is very poor and unable to afford it. Yesterday, Cai Cangjun, a member of the support association, obtained a large branch of ginseng from Zhou Qiansheng of Cai Tongde Pharmacy as a donation. However, it is said that the doctors who have visited Pan's residence have all declined to treat him after examining him. Therefore, his life is in great danger.</p>

<h3>Registration of Chartered Rickshaw Pullers in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>The Deadline Is This Month, the 17th</p>
<p>Failure to Register Will Result in a Ban on Pulling Rickshaws</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession opened registration for self-owned rickshaw (i.e., chartered rickshaw) pullers in the concession on September 1st of this year.

The two offices are still open daily. All chartered rickshaw pullers who have not yet registered must go immediately. The deadline is Saturday, the 17th of this month, after which registration will no longer be accepted.

<h3>The Pudong Rent Reduction Association Is Established</h3>
<p>Over two hundred households of the Lai Yidu Shop in Pudong, Shanghai, jointly petitioned the South District Rent Reduction Association to request the establishment of a Pudong branch association. Zheng Xiecheng, Zhao Shizhong, Ren Baiguang, Wei Chaopin, and Wang Wujun were elected as standing committee members. Hu Jiamo, Zhang Binghua, Liu Yunfeng, Cao Qingxian, Ying Kaixuan, Sun Qiangmin, Dai Yongfa, Ren Mingliang, Wang Shifa, Lu Chunshan, and Xie Yongfa were elected as executive committee members. Wo Xiufu, Zhou Jiren, Chen Mingrong, and Cao Aru were elected as supervisory committee members. They have begun working and have set up their office at 54 Renji Road, Dongchang Road. Registration has been very enthusiastic in recent days. It has been verified that the elected committee members are all well-established shops and peaceful residents in the area. They seek to ensure the well-being of the public by alleviating their personal suffering and do not charge tenants a registration fee. Therefore, the results have been good. It is also reported that the City District Rent Reduction Association has forwarded the matter to the Party government authorities for record and that the Shanghai Public Security Bureau has instructed the Pudong Branch Bureau to provide appropriate protection.</p>
<h3>More Overseas Chinese in Japan Have Been Deported</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese working in Tokyo, Japan, such as He Mingsheng, Jin Duanzhai, Xu Shuiru, and Zhan Zhudi, were previously deported by Japanese police, who took them to the police station and forced them onto the Japanese ship Ikoma Maru to be sent back to China. All their money was confiscated by the Japanese police and forcibly used to purchase ship tickets. Therefore, when they arrived in Shanghai yesterday, they were all in a very sorry state.</p>

<h3>Guanghua and Russian Oil Amend Contract</h3>
<p>Eliminating the Management System and Changing to a Purchase and Sale System</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was heard that Guanghua Petroleum Company in Shanghai and Russian Oil had amended their contract. A reporter from this newspaper inquired with the person in charge of Guanghua, whose reply was as follows:</p>
<p>Business Situation</p>
<p>Guanghua started business in 1929, purchasing and selling American oil. With the support of Chinese people, the business was very good. In 1931, Russian oil arrived in Shanghai. In order to avoid competition, Guanghua signed a management contract with them on August 25th, which was implemented from January 1932. In 1933, oil companies had misunderstandings, and oil prices fell, resulting in losses for everyone. However, Chinese users benefited greatly from the low prices. Guanghua only earned commissions under the management system, so it was not affected by the drop in oil prices. Although the profit was less, there was no loss. Since this spring, oil companies have been sincerely cooperating and negotiating with each other, and oil prices have gradually recovered. The Russian side also has no intention of monopolizing the market, so it agreed to Guanghua's request to cancel the management contract on August 25th and amend it to a oil purchase contract. From then on, business is completely under Guanghua's independent responsibility, restoring the system of 1931. This is the actual situation in recent days.</p>
<p>My Personal Thoughts</p>
<p>As for my personal feelings about this oil price competition, I have three thoughts: (1) The British and American oil companies and Soviet oil companies are willing to make significant sacrifices to compete for the market, and their spirit is admirable. (2) Soviet Russia and China, just after resuming trade, were also able to sacrifice huge losses to compete with British and American oil companies, and the market they won was given to our Chinese merchants as managers. Their great spirit in business is also respectable. (3) In recent years, China's banking industry has paid more and more attention to supporting industry. Even during the period of oil price competition in the past two years, Guanghua has been trusted by various banks and given strong support. Their concern for maintaining industry is truly commendable. As for the operation of the kerosene business in the future, it will be more difficult than before, firstly because tariffs are heavier than before, and secondly because tax-free local oil is rampant in the market. If the government does not prohibit local oil, the sales of various oil companies will be reduced, and the government's tariff revenue will also be affected.</p>

<h3>Various Circles Association for Aiding Patriots Sends Letters Requesting Rescue of Patriotic People</h3>
<p>Please Consult the Municipal Council to Drop Charges Against Liang Tongfang</p>
<p>Further Petition the Authorities for Special Pardon for Liu Chongwu and Others</p>
<p>The Various Circles Association for Aiding Patriotic People in this city believes that Liang Tongfang injured himself when throwing a grenade to warn the Yuelai Native Products Store, and was arrested by the police. Liu Chongwu and others were sentenced too severely. They have repeatedly requested a special pardon, but have not been granted approval. The association has sent letters to the Citizens' United Association and the Bar Association, requesting them to forward the request for rescue and further petition the judicial authorities to grant a special pardon. The respective letters are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Please Drop Charges Against Liang Tongfang: The First Special District Citizens' United Association, after receiving a letter from the Patriotic People Association, yesterday sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, requesting them to forward a consultation to the Municipal Council to not prosecute Liang Tongfang's case in order to meet the public's expectations. The original letter stated, "We are writing to you on the basis of a letter from the Shanghai Association for Aiding Patriotic People, which stated that the patriotic person Liang Tongfang, out of anger at the shamelessness of treacherous merchants selling Japanese goods, which is tantamount to hastening their own demise, was moved by righteous indignation on October 19th and took a grenade to the Yuelai Native Products Store on Wuma Road as a warning. Due to unstable placement, it fell to the ground and exploded, causing Liang Tongfang to bear the brunt and also affecting many others. He is currently detained by the police and is requesting you forward to the Municipal Council a request not to prosecute him," etc. Based on this, we believe that Liang Tongfang's motivation for this act was purely out of patriotic fervor. At a time when foreign insults are increasingly urgent and the national crisis is at its height, although this kind of action is inevitably rash, it is out of deep patriotic concern and intended as a warning, and is a voluntary righteous act, the circumstances of which are pitiable. From the standpoint of the country and from the standpoint of national consciousness, public justice should be promoted and assistance should be given. Your association is the highest organ of Chinese taxpayers in the concession. We hereby request you to forward a consultation to the Municipal Council to not prosecute Liang Tongfang's case and immediately release him in order to meet the public's expectations. It would be fortunate for the country and fortunate for society. Sincerely, to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai Public Concession.</p>
<p>Special Pardon for Liu Chongwu and Others: The Various Circles Association for Aiding Patriotic People wrote to the Bar Association, requesting them to further petition the Ministry of Judicial Administration to quickly grant a special pardon to the patriotic people Liu Chongwu and others. The original letter stated, "We are writing to you that since our country was militarily occupied by Japanese bandits in the Northeast and began to covet our Songhu area, the authorities have gradually paid attention to the equipment for border defense, as well as industrial and commercial industries related to international matters, and have been striving to strengthen national power. This shows the painstaking efforts of governance. At that time, the general patriotic people were deeply angered by the treacherous merchants who disregarded the suffering compatriots who were being ravaged and continued to sell enemy goods to enrich their own pockets. Therefore, there were patriotic actions by Liu Chongwu, Tian Shuiyang, Pan Hongsheng, Zeng Songshou, etc. Liu Chongwu hoped to curb this trend. Unfortunately, they were imprisoned. Fortunately, your association upheld justice and petitioned the central government to earnestly request a special pardon. We understand that a reply has been received, ordering a petition to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for handling the case. The relatives of the aforementioned people have repeatedly come to the association for help, and after a temporary emergency meeting of the association on November 1st, it was resolved to write to your association to further petition the Ministry of Judicial Administration for a special pardon, in order to reassure the families of the aforementioned and to fulfill the expectations of the masses. We have urgently recorded the case and hereby inform you, hoping that you will review and handle it, which would be a great kindness. Sincerely, to the Shanghai Bar Association.</p>

<h3>Customs Patrol Ship Annihilates Pirates</h3>
<p>Pirate Ship Sunk, Six Hostages Rescued</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs patrol ship "Wenxing" engaged in a fierce battle with pirates around one hundred miles south of the Wusongkou front the day before yesterday. As a result, two of the ten pirates were killed, three drowned, and five were captured. Three of the captured criminals were already injured at the time of capture. Of the ten hostages held captive on the pirate ship, six were rescued, one of whom was injured by a bullet. The remaining four hostages drowned when the pirate ship sank. On the customs sailors' side, only one person went missing and three were slightly injured. The ship returned to Shanghai at 11:45 PM the night before last and was docked at buoy number 18 in the Huangpu River. According to the report from the ship's sailors, the course of the battle with the pirates was as follows: the ship left port around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, as usual, to conduct a ten-day anti-smuggling patrol. This trip was originally intended to patrol from Shanghai along the coast to Ningbo and the North Saddle Island area. After sailing out, just as it reached about one hundred miles south of Wusongkou, near the Fu Port area of Zhejiang, the ship's officers immediately discovered a large sand boat parked next to another sand boat, with several sampans parked near the beach. Because the customs patrol personnel at the time saw that the large sand boat was heavily loaded, they became suspicious and sent a small boat, led by Captain Qiaoxi, with three Chinese sailors to investigate. Unexpectedly, as they boarded the sand boat to conduct a search, they were shot at by the pirates. One sailor was injured. At that time, outnumbered and outgunned, they retreated together. The injured sailor went missing due to being injured and unable to escape in time. The Customs "Wenxing" patrol ship opened fire and returned fire at the sand boat, and thus the fierce battle began. The patrol ship decided to sink the sand boat and swept the hull with machine guns. Before long, the hull was riddled with holes and sank. Thereupon, the pirates were captured. The ten hostages who were kidnapped were all fishermen. Except for those who drowned due to the ship sinking and those who died from being shot, the rest were rescued. After the incident, a thorough search for the injured sailor yielded no results. He probably drowned while trying to escape.</p>
<h3>Landlord Coerces Civilians, Forbidding Vegetable Vendors to Peddle</h3>
<p>Small Vendors Suddenly Lose Their Livelihood</p>
<p>Residents All Complain Bitterly</p>
<p>Lane 3 of Hengfeng Lane, Hengsheng Lane, and Sida Lane on Shigaota Road are operated by the Hengfeng, Hengsheng, and Hengli Companies, with over 1,500 households. Traditionally, the company has always allowed vegetable vendors carrying shoulder poles to enter the lane to peddle, but with the restriction that it be limited to between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Most residents found it quite convenient. Unexpectedly, the landlord of Hengfeng Lane, surnamed Zhou, at the request of a few residents who owned private chartered cars, believing that the comings and goings of vegetable vendors obstructed traffic, suddenly presented a request to the competent Third Section of the Fifth District, starting from the 1st of this month, to prohibit vegetable vendors from entering and exiting. Considering that most of the tenants in the three lanes belong to the common people class, and the vegetable market is on Tiantong Road, about four stops away, they suddenly heard that the landlord, disregarding the convenience of the residents and the livelihood of the small vendors, rose up in resistance. Currently, the tenants of the three lanes are all extremely resentful and will unite to issue a serious warning to the landlords of the three lanes. At the same time, over a thousand small vendors, forced by their livelihood and suddenly cut off from their sales channels, gathered from various trades, believing that the Third Section of the Fifth District did not consider the interests of the public and only listened to the landlord's orders, which was particularly unsatisfactory. The reporter went to Sida Lane to investigate the truth of the matter and saw that the residents in the lane were all filled with resentment, saying that Zhou, the landlord of Hengfeng Lane, because he owned a private chartered car and went in and out every day, was jealous of the comings and goings of the small vendors, and invited the landlords of Hengsheng and Sida Lanes to strongly request the competent authority to interfere. The Third Section of the Fifth District, without considering the lives of the small vendors and the habits of the residents, rashly ordered a prohibition. It is said that the tenants of the three lanes have successively reduced rents along Shigaota Road, but the three lanes of Hengfeng, Hengsheng, and Sida not only ignored it but also sought personal gain and oppressed the civilians, and will have considerable methods to deal with it, etc.</p>
<h3>New Method of Enticing Gambling by Con Artists</h3>
<p>Using Rhodesian Foreign Buttons as Gambling Tools</p>
<p>Dividing into Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Enter Treasure, and Exit Treasure</p>
<p>—Liu Dinggui and Con Artists Detained Together—</p>
<p>Liu Dinggui, a native of Tongzhou residing at No. 66 opposite Puyutang outside the Dananmen in the Nanshi district, published an advertisement in the Xinwen Daily last month, stating that he had twelve buildings built on rented land in the Xiqiao area, with eighteen years remaining on the lease, and was willing to sell them at a low price. If anyone was interested, they could contact him. The next day, a person named Jin Shutang sent a letter to Liu, saying that someone wanted to buy the house and requested him to contact him at Room 415 on the upper floor of the Changsha Merchants' Warehouse in the Diandang Street on Gongguan Road, etc. Liu then went to the appointment. When he arrived, he saw a signboard of Yufengtai Zhuang hanging at the door of the room. He entered and saw Jin seated. As they were conversing, a person surnamed Mo came to Jin and asked for 500 yuan. Jin immediately handed over 500 yuan in cash to Mo. After he left, Jin said to Liu, "The Mo family has millions of dollars in assets and is addicted to gambling. We might as well raise a gambling stake of 20,000 yuan and pretend to gamble with Mo. In secret, we can agree in advance that we can win tens of thousands of yuan from him. It's as easy as pie." Liu was deeply convinced and agreed. He went home to retrieve 200 yuan and went to the Changsha Merchants' Warehouse again. Jin claimed that he had already raised 10,000 yuan, using Rhodesian foreign buttons as gambling tools. The dealer would hold a handful of buttons in his hand and ask the gamblers to guess the number, called "grabbing the spread." The dealer and his accomplices would agree in advance that the dealer would hold a chopstick, dial the Rhodesian buttons, and extend his finger to press on the chopstick, using one to four as a secret code, which would indicate the number of buttons in the palm, divided into Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Enter Treasure, and Exit Treasure. Jin arranged everything and then ordered Liu Dinggui to be the dealer. Liu then sat down and followed the procedure. However, Jin and the gamblers present were all accomplices. Therefore, in the blink of an eye, Liu had lost 200 yuan in cash and still owed over 5,000 yuan to Jin. Liu was heartbroken. Jin then ordered Liu to go home and raise more money, hoping to gamble again on the 31st to recoup his losses. Liu went home disappointed and began to realize that Jin and others had set up a gambling scam. He reported to the French police for investigation. Inspector Jin Jiulin, detective Jiang Changwen, and detectives Dai Rongji, Jin Bingwen, Zuo Qihong, etc., went and arrested Wanren Yan Songchen (resident of No. 10 Xinzha Road) and Wang Shoushan (nickname Huang Da Liuzi, resident of No. 145 Meibaike Road). After interrogation by the police chief, it was deemed that the plaintiff Liu Dinggui had participated in gambling, which was also inappropriate, and ordered them to be detained together. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Branch Court. Judge Sun Pengxian提提 interrogated them. Because the police requested a postponement to investigate the case and apprehend the accomplices who were at large, the court reviewed the tickets and briefly questioned the defendants, then ordered that the interrogation be postponed for seven days. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Romanian Man Privately Alters Alien Passport</h3>
<p>Possession of Handgun Also Unlicensed</p>
<p>Prosecuted After Investigation by Police</p>
<p>Romanian Mouxiyaluo Poersike, who worked as an engineer in Shanghai, lived at 115 Fookaison Road in the French Concession. The alien passport he held was issued by the Canadian government in English, but the name and nationality on the passport were inconsistent with Mouxiyaluo's. After the police of the Public Concession investigated and found that the passport was indeed forged by Mouxiyaluo, they reported it to the First District Court and issued an arrest warrant. At 3:30 PM on the 25th of last month, Chief Patrol Pappu caught Mouxiyaluo on Fookaison Road and found a "Shaoyou" brand automatic pistol, six bullets, and a passport in his car. He was handed over to the First District Court and ordered to be detained for investigation. Now, according to the police's investigation with the British Consulate in Shanghai, the results confirmed that the passport had indeed been altered by Mouxiyaluo, and that the weapons he possessed were also unlicensed. Therefore, according to Article 233 of the Criminal Law on forging documents and Article 2 of the Regulations on the Prohibition of Military Firearms, a public prosecution was filed. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye ordered the defendant to be brought to court for interrogation. After the police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the case, the court immediately interrogated the defendant. However, he denied that the passport was forged by him, but stated that due to certain entanglements when he went to Italy, he changed the name on the passport. As for the failure to register the firearms, he argued that his pistol was placed in the car at the time, and the car was parked in the French Concession of Fookaison Road. Since it was neither hidden on his person nor did he step into the Public Concession, he did not need to register, etc. However, the investigating Chief Patrol testified that the defendant was arrested on the Public Concession side. After the police lawyer and the defendant's defense lawyer debated successively, Judge Qian ordered the defendant to pay 3,000 yuan bail and wait for the verdict next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Tram Passenger Falls Under Train</h3>
<p>Right Foot Crushed, Life in Danger</p>
<p>Zheng Quankang, a 27-year-old native of Ningbo, works as a clerk at Naiqiao Clock Shop on Kunming Road. Yesterday evening at 11:30 PM, Zheng intended to take the No. 1 streetcar home from the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road. Unexpectedly, after boarding the car, he lost his footing, and the iron door was not closed, causing him to fall face up from the car and into the bottom of the car. As a result, his left foot was crushed by the wheels, and his head was also seriously injured. Fortunately, a nearby guard noticed and quickly ordered the car to stop. He was then dragged out and urgently summoned an ambulance to Renji Hospital for treatment. The situation is critical, and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Chen Xiangtao Discusses the Rapid Development of Tourism in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Tourists Send More Than Ten Million Yuan in Remittances</p>
<p>Mayor Shen's Prosperity Plan Succeeds</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Xiangtao, the president of the China Travel Service, went to Qingdao twice this time due to company affairs and deeply felt that Qingdao will definitely become a tourism center in the future. The reporter visited him yesterday and received the following report on Qingdao's tourism construction: "Around the summer of this year, I went to Qingdao twice on business. Observing from the perspective of a travel operator, I deeply feel that Qingdao will definitely become a tourism and sightseeing center in the future, which is my intention. I cannot help but say a word about the efforts of the Qingdao authorities to prosper the city. Judging from the records of our company, I can give a brief overview of the progress of various summer resorts in the past two or three years: The mountain area is best represented by Guling because Chairman Chiang held meetings and officer training classes there, with dignitaries and ladies flocking there. Mogan Mountain suffered from drought this year, which inevitably affected tourism. In terms of seaside resorts, Beidaihe was affected by the Northeast Incident, and tourism declined far less than in the past. On the contrary, Qingdao saw a sharp increase in tourists during the peak summer season, with even the remaining houses in the city being completely rented out. Thousands of people went to the seaside to escape the heat. A certain local bank told me that American naval personnel alone remitted more than two million yuan to Qingdao in one summer. If we consider all tourists, the amount of money brought to Qingdao must have exceeded ten million yuan. The travel industry is originally a new type of industry, and the amount of investment it attracts is considerable. Therefore, internationally, it has long been regarded as an 'invisible export.' In our country, this industry is still in its infancy, and few people know about it. I deeply believe that it can attract more attention in the future in order to seek its development and advancement. Qingdao's summer resort benefits greatly from its natural landscape. The clear water and white sand complement each other, and the scenery of Laoshan is pleasant. However, without the efforts of Mayor Shen Honglie and the gentlemen of the municipal government, it would be almost impossible to develop Qingdao into a travel center. Here are the most notable points: Last year, under the leadership of Commander Shen, the Qingdao Prosperity Promotion Association was established, with the aim of developing the travel industry. Twenty-five local celebrities were invited to be members, and employees were hired to handle daily affairs. Two types of magazines, one in Chinese and one in English, were published. The English one was named 'Qingdao's Outlook,' and the Chinese one was called 'Qingdao Pictorial,' published every two weeks. In addition, a Chinese-English tour guide manual was published, with five copies in a set, and distributed free of charge. In addition to publishing books and newspapers, the association also worked hard on transportation, public safety, and entertainment. As a result, the public transportation companies, which used to have irregular routes, vehicles, and fare collection, and inadequate equipment, were merged into a large organization called the Xinren Society under the strict supervision of the municipal government. On the one hand, it provides satisfactory service to the public, and on the other hand, it gives the shareholders of each company a reasonable profit. The association also urged the theaters to improve their hygiene equipment and sent personnel to inspect them from time to time. In order to increase the interest of tourists, the association raised funds to build four steamers, four yachts, and eleven rowing boats, which were rented to guests at low prices. Road and vehicle traffic were improved, and in October, the traffic was changed to the left-hand side for the convenience of tourists. In terms of public safety, the Public Security Bureau is responsible, and the whole city is worry-free. Moreover, due to the strict household registration investigation, bandits and thieves have nowhere to hide in Qingdao, and it is even more difficult to use their skills. The sea inhabitants who are disgusted by being in the company of镖师镖师 and cannot help but have them protect them can be freed from the shackles and live freely and happily in Qingdao. Good roads are being built near Qingdao at any time. Most of the roads in and out of the city are paved with asphalt, so it is very comfortable to drive around Qingdao. This year, the China Travel Service has obtained special convenience in Qingdao, using low-dust fees to transport cars to the port. For example, if customers transport cars from Shanghai to Qingdao, they only need to pay the travel agency a deposit of 50 yuan. When the ship arrives at the port, if they notify in advance, the company will send someone to the pier with the car license. As soon as it is properly hung up, the car can drive straight away. At the same time, customs inspection and registration procedures are handled by the company, so that the tourists can just sit back and enjoy the results. Recently, many new roads have been built, connecting with Qingdao and reaching major cities. It takes eight hours by car from Qingdao to Jixian County, and nine, five, and six hours to Huangxian, Shahe, and Haiyang, respectively. There is also a specially built road to Laoshan, which can be reached directly. It takes about an hour by car. There are many flat roads in the mountains, which are very suitable for walking or riding in sedan chairs. The best impression tourists have after arriving in Qingdao is not only the clean streets and complete public buildings that are constantly being cleaned up, but also the ability of Mayor Shen to solve the problem of beggars, which is different from other cities in the country that are full of鸠形鹊鸠形鹊. There are a total of 580 beggars in Qingdao, but they are never seen on the streets. This is because the mayor cares about the poor and drives them all to a small island called Dongdao. The government pays for them to work separately. Among them, 300 people are engaged in road construction, 30 crippled beggars make gunpowder boxes, and the remaining 200 people are sent to the reformatory to learn various skills, such as shoemaking, carpet weaving, iron forging, spinning, rope making, printing, etc. In addition to working, they also have to take classes for two hours every day. Those who have reformed and learned a skill are allowed to make a living on their own and become healthy citizens. From this, it can be seen that Mayor Shen's attention to society and the happiness of citizens is not neglected because of their humble status. Mayor Shen treats the people like his own children and is loved by all the citizens of Qingdao. I believe that I am humble and dare not sing the praises of the mayor's achievements, but from the standpoint of a travel agency, Mayor Shen's support and maintenance of the travel industry is truly appreciated."</p>
<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Strictly Prohibits Infanticide and Damage to Children's Corpses</h3>
<p>Offenders Will Be Sentenced to Death or Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Ignorant People Should Not Test the Law</p>
<p>Wu Xingya, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, issued a public notice yesterday to strictly prohibit the acts of cutting infant corpses and chopping sick children, which have been found in remote areas, due to the ignorance and superstition of ghosts and gods among the people in the city. The notice will be posted on all major roads. The original text is recorded as follows: "It is strictly forbidden to kill sick infants and damage children's corpses. However, recent investigations have found that there are still cases of cut infant corpses in remote areas. After repeated investigations, it has been found that most of them are ignorant people who superstitiously believe in ghosts and gods and have the saying of repeatedly injuring children or chopping sick or dead children to ward off evil stars. This is extremely cruel and inhuman, and also violates the criminal law. Killing a sick child constitutes the crime of murder and shall be punished with death or life imprisonment according to law. Chopping a child's corpse constitutes the crime of damaging a corpse and shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than six months and not more than five years. Ignorant people, lightly believing in unfounded rumors, have violated the law and are extremely pitiable. This notice is specially reissued to reiterate the prohibition, and I hope that you will not deliberately violate the prohibition and test the law. This is a serious matter."</p>
<h3>Patrolman's Red Pill Trafficking Case</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment and Fined 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Huang Fugen, a Chinese detective from Huishan Police Station, cracked a red pill drug trafficking operation at 151 Aikercock Road at 8:30 PM on the 27th of last month and seized sixty taels of red pills, totaling six thousand three hundred and fifty-four pills, and a set of smoking paraphernalia. The Shaoxing woman Chai He and the maid Chen Ye were arrested. A patrol uniform with the number 2636 was hanging in the room. Upon questioning, it was found that the name was Liang Wende, a native of Lu, who worked at the Huishan Police Station. The two women and the exhibits were sent to the First Branch Court for interrogation and detention. The afternoon before yesterday, around 3:00 PM, Chinese Detective Cai Liu learned that the Chinese patrolman was drinking tea at a tea house at 221 Maohai Road and secretly went to apprehend him and brought him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he and the two women were sent to the Third Criminal Court. Gongbuju Attorney Li Zhishan stated the course of the case and filed a public prosecution according to Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, requesting an investigation. Upon questioning, Liang Wende confessed that he had been acquainted with Chai He for about half a year. He lived at 18 Yifengli on the same road. The red pills belonged to his friend Xu. The rest of his confession was evasive. The testimony of the two women was as before. The next court hearing was similar. Judge Wu Zehan sentenced Liang Wende to two years' imprisonment and a fine of 200 yuan, sentenced Chai He to six months and a fine of 60 yuan, confiscated the exhibits, and acquitted Chen.</p>
<h3>Two People Take Poison</h3>
<p>Du Zhang, a young woman from Shaoxing, is 28 years old and lives at 5 Yixingli, Changan Road, Zhabei. Her husband, Du Bingsheng, is a 탐伙探伙. Recently, due to economic difficulties, the couple often quarreled. Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, they had another argument over money. Not long after, she secretly took a large dose of poison to commit suicide. She was discovered and rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is said that her condition is very serious and her life is in danger. Chen Mingquan, a 31-year-old native of Ningbo, was staying at Room 103 of the Jiangzhe Hotel at 110 Hankou Road. For some unknown reason the night before last, he secretly swallowed poison to commit suicide. He was discovered by the tea boy at 5:30 AM yesterday morning and was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to taking too much poison, the treatment was ineffective, and he died of poisoning around 4:00 PM in the afternoon. He was transferred to the coroner's office for examination.</p>

The entrances were also congested, with latecomers barely able to enter. This level of attendance was rarely seen in previous draws. After the first prize number was announced, the atmosphere became tense, but soon returned to calm as most of the audience, disappointed, left the venue.</p>

<h3>Bloodshed at Tianyun Building</h3>
<p>Female Tea Server Stabbed Three Times</p>
<p>Wang Futin's Brutal Nature</p>
<p>Ms. Wu Yang, known as Sanmei, a female server at the Tianyun Building amusement hall of Wing On Company, formed an intimate relationship with Wang Futin from Shaoxing in February of this year. They rented a house together in Zhabei. Wang, being over the age of discretion and having a coarse temperament, had no stable occupation and associated with idlers. However, Yang Sanmei held a different view and favored him, willingly entering into a cohabitation. She provided for him, but after three months, she regretted her initial choice, leading to frequent conflicts. By April 28th, they separated. But Wang harbored resentment. On the first of this month, at 7:30 PM, Wang purchased a sharp butcher knife and went to Tianyun Building. Upon meeting Sanmei, he lured her outside with a pretext. Sanmei, remembering their past affection, could not refuse. As they walked together, while on the staircase between the fourth and third floors, Wang suddenly pulled out the butcher knife from his sleeve and repeatedly slashed Sanmei's neck three times. Sanmei cried out in pain and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Wang abandoned the knife and fled, but was apprehended by Huang Shouan, who was ascending the stairs, and handed over to the No. 45 Indian police officer, along with the murder weapon. The injured woman was taken to the Laozha Police Station. After questioning, the police dispatched detectives to send Yang Sanmei to Renji Hospital for treatment. Wang Futin was taken to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning, where Judge Qian interrogated him. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang charged him with attempted murder under Article 282 of the Criminal Code. However, due to the victim being still in the hospital, he requested the case be postponed for further questioning. The defendant admitted that after leaving Ningbo, he sent three letters to Wu Yangmei, but received no response. He returned to Shanghai on October 30th and purchased the knife from a Japanese store in the Hongkou Triangle Market. He also confessed to slashing the woman's neck three times at Tianyun Building. He claimed that he had no intention of killing her, only to scare her. Judge Qian, finding the defendant's brutality and claim of merely scaring her to be a blatant attempt to shirk responsibility, ordered him to be detained and the case adjourned for seven days, pending the victim's recovery.</p>
<h3>Obscene "Love Series" Books</h3>
<p>Peng Zhaoliang Reports to Police</p>
<p>Seized Books to be Confiscated</p>
<p>The Manli Bookstore at 221 Shandong Road, owned by Wu Haolu, recently published a series of books titled "Love Series," heavily advertising them with a focus on relationships between men and women. Each book sold for $1.20, and since its publication, it had become extremely popular. However, on the 12th of last month, at 11:30 AM, Peng Zhaoliang, residing at 42 Yuzhen Lane, Lefeber Road, French Concession, along with lawyer Yang Lian, reported to the General Police Station that the "Love Series" contained obscene content, specifically detailing various forms of intercourse between men and women from different countries, which was harmful to young people. He requested a ban on the books and submitted a written report along with a copy of the book and a receipt. He stated that in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), he opened the Meide Bookstore on Fuzhou Road, which specialized in printing sex novels written by sexology doctor Zhang Jingsheng. After the books were released, the Municipal Council deemed them obscene, repeatedly banning them and taking legal action in court. Now, Manli Bookstore had repackaged Zhang Jingsheng's books, renaming them the "Love Series," and was openly advertising and selling them. The obscenity of the content was self-evident, especially pages 42 and 43. He requested that the books be banned. The police thoroughly inspected the book and confirmed the claims. They requested a search warrant from the First Special Court and dispatched Detective Han Shoushan to Manli Bookstore yesterday, seizing 110 copies of the "Love Series" and bringing them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the books were transported to the Second Criminal Court of the Second Special District. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the above information, adding that when they searched the store yesterday, Manager Wu Qinglu was absent, so he was not arrested. He would be prosecuted at a later date. He requested that the seized books be confiscated. Huang Huai of the court ordered the seized books to be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Robbery Ringleader Working as Tea Server</h3>
<p>Linked to the Shooting of a Police Officer</p>
<p>Arrested and Detained for Further Investigation</p>
<p>On the morning of December 3rd of last year, at 7:40 AM, the home of Madam Zhou Yi at 4 Huatong Lane, North Xizang Road, was invaded by multiple robbers who stole valuables worth over one hundred dollars. The local police station dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to apprehend the suspects. The robbers, in desperation, fled wildly through Kulun Road in the Chinese district, where they were stopped by police officer Zhang Liankui, No. 2073, and shot, resulting in his death. Subsequently, detectives from the Hongkou Police Station arrested three suspects, Zhou Maoxian, Lin Xiaogui, and Wang Weichun, all from Jiangbei, and handed them over to the First Special District Court for trial. Zhou was sentenced to death, and Lin and Wang were sentenced to prison. Zhou appealed the verdict to the Supreme Court, where the case was still pending. On the 15th of last month, Chinese detective Zhang Yunyan of the Yangshupu Police Station learned that the ringleader of the robbery, Yu Songnian from Qingjiang, was hiding in the Huashang Hotel on Minguo Road, working as a tea server. He collaborated with detectives from the Public Security Bureau to arrest Yu and brought him back to the police station for investigation at the First Special Court. Municipal Council Lawyer Li Zhishan stated that Zhou Maoxian, who had been sentenced to death, had been brought forward for questioning. Zhou testified that he was from Yancheng, lived near the Xiangyan Bridge in Hongkou, and sold fish. He confessed to the Xizang Road robbery, stating that he and five others, including Lao Huang, Wang Wu, Lin Xiaogui, someone surnamed Wang, and Lao Yu (the defendant), went to the location. Lao Yu stood watch on the road, armed with a handgun. The robbery was initiated by Lao Huang and the defendant, and the firearms were provided by the defendant. After the incident, they fled the Chinese district. He claimed that the defendant shot and killed the police officer. When questioned, Yu Songnian claimed that Lao Huang had informed him, and he had reported it to Chinese detective chief Wei Jinfu and the deceased detective Ri Baocheng of the Hongkou Police Station. He stated that Zhou, Lin, and Wang were apprehended, and he hated being falsely accused. Lawyer Li also stated that a Western detective had reported that a prisoner with the number 2713 had heard that Lao Yu had been arrested and that he was the one who shot the police officer. Therefore, he requested the case be adjourned for a week to bring the prisoner in for identification. Judge Xiao approved the request and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Repeatedly Opening and Liquidating Cigarette Factories</h3>
<p>Hong Cangting and Weiting Brothers Accused</p>
<p>Aggrieved Parties File Lawsuit in Anger</p>
<p>The Hong Cangting and Weiting brothers from Ningbo have been involved in the cigarette business in Shanghai for many years. Since the 16th year of the Republic (1927), they have opened numerous cigarette factories or tobacco companies. Each time, they would assume key positions as managers or deputy managers. However, the businesses never lasted long, either closing down completely or changing their brand names, and declaring liquidation. Consequently, each liquidation resulted in considerable losses for those who were owed money and other creditors, while the Hong brothers' pockets were filled through the liquidation process. Chen Jimao, also from Ningbo, was a tobacco leaf merchant. Since the Hong brothers established the Huada Cigarette Factory in early 1927, he traded with them. Each time Hong liquidated a business, Chen suffered losses. On the first of last month, the Hong brothers' Huada Yuanji company declared liquidation again, and Chen's losses from dishonored checks were even greater, which he could no longer tolerate. He hired lawyer Xi Ya'fu to file a criminal self-accusation against Hong Cangting and Weiting for fraudulent acquisition of property. He stated that the defendants opened the Huada Cigarette Factory in 1927, which quickly went bankrupt and declared liquidation. In 1930, they renamed it Huada Shenji and continued operations, only to go bankrupt again. In 1933, they renamed it Huayuan Yuanji. However, after less than a year, on October 1st, they employed the same old trick and declared liquidation. The defendants always seized opportunities to accumulate debt, harming hundreds of merchants. The plaintiff, Chen, traded with the defendants extensively, suffering the most severe losses. Since 1933, he had provided tobacco leaves worth 60,000 dollars, but before the payment was made, the defendants mortgaged the tobacco leaves to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, using foreign capital to engage in fraudulent business. The checks they issued, totaling $59,192.42, were returned due to insufficient funds. After repeated negotiations, he was able to redeem the tobacco leaves. After selling the leaves and repaying the mortgage, there was a remaining balance of $7,226. Adding the remaining $14,726 from the Huacheng Tobacco Company shares and the amount received from cashing checks, he was still defrauded of $22,505.60. Now, the defendants were again using the guise of liquidation and intended to discount and repay their debts. The fact that the defendants had opened cigarette factories, changed their names multiple times within a few years, and were always managed by the two brothers indicated a hidden agenda. The most obvious aspect was that they could obtain illegal profits by discounting and repaying debts through the name of liquidation. Therefore, their opening of cigarette factories was nothing more than a tool for fraud, violating Article 163 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. Therefore, he filed a self-accusation requesting that they be punished according to the law and ordered to repay the defrauded amount of $22,505.60. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng of the First District Local Court held a hearing. The defendants also hired lawyer Wang Zijian to defend them. Judge Huang, noting that the parties were initially friends, ordered them to attempt to reconcile outside of court. The case was adjourned for further hearing. When Hong's cigarette factory declared liquidation last year, it was also accused of fraud in court by a customer because the foreign checks they paid were worthless and the goods had been secretly mortgaged in advance. This is the second time they have been accused.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemums in Full Bloom at Municipal Garden</h3>
<p>The municipal garden has been planting chrysanthemums for many years, and it is well known to the people of Shanghai. This year, the garden collected excellent chrysanthemum species from famous scenic spots across the country, even more than in previous years, reaching over 600 species, totaling 7-8,000 pots. All are rare and precious varieties, rarely seen in other gardens. Recently, they have been blooming in full splendor, with vibrant reds, purples, and other colors, extremely beautiful. It is said that the garden, for the sake of fellow enthusiasts, will offer them for sale at low prices, except for those kept for seed propagation. Those with a fondness for chrysanthemums have been visiting the garden. The garden is located in Donggou, Pudong, only a short distance from the ferry terminal. Bordering the river and the sea, it boasts natural beauty, fresh air, and convenient transportation. A visit to the garden is sure to refresh the mind and spirit, making it a scenic spot in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Banquets Guests at Guansheng Farm</h3>
<p>Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, recently came to Shanghai and was drawn by the refreshing scenery and unique agricultural products of the Guansheng Farm in Caohejing, unlike those found in ordinary farms. He hosted a banquet at the farm yesterday, with attendees including Central Committee members Cheng Qian and Gao Yihan. They were accompanied by Xue Shouting, the assistant manager of Guansheng Garden, and Yang Bolan, the director of the farm. They enjoyed a Guangzhou-style meal prepared with vegetables, melons, and fruits from the farm. During the meal, Yu Youren inscribed "Yellow Flowers Fragrant in Late Season" for the farm's chrysanthemums. Other Central Committee members also composed poems. They returned to their residences as the sun set.</p>
<h3>Central Chemical Glass Factory招待es Reporters for a Tour Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Central Chemical Glass Factory on Pingliang Road招待ed reporters at Yizhixiang on Simadu Road. Over thirty reporters attended. Manager Qian Xinzhi gave a speech, followed by a speech by Guan Guanzhi, a chemistry professor at Datong University. After the meal, they toured the factory. Here is a brief account of the event:</p>
<p>General Remarks</p>
<p>Our country has been learning from the West for several decades, but due to years of war, the results have not been satisfactory. Therefore, science and culture are still lagging behind. Recently, with deepening pain, Chinese scholars know that only by promoting science can China be saved. Therefore, we are promoting scientific research on one hand and striving to popularize scientific knowledge on the other. This is truly a good phenomenon in our country, and we are extremely gratified. However, the instruments, reagents, and other items used in scientific research must all be imported from abroad. Glassware and reagents are especially expensive. Not only is it time-consuming to order, but the price is also extremely high. This often prevents many schools, hospitals, and scholars from acquiring complete equipment due to economic constraints. This greatly hinders the freedom of scientific and cultural progress in our country. In view of this, with the aim of "Every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation," we have raised funds and built a factory to specialize in the production of various chemical and medical glassware, as well as modern household glassware. We have hired contemporary experts to carefully review each product, ensuring that the products are exquisite and the prices are very low, to serve the whole country and promote the popularization of science and culture. Retrieving foreign exchange outflow is a secondary matter. We hope that the press will promote our efforts. We would be most grateful.</p>
<p>Product Types</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary chemical glassware, including beakers, flasks, evaporating dishes, glass covers, funnels, retort stands, condensers, gas generators, gas dryers, distillation and evaporation apparatus, desiccators, gas scrubbers, gas absorbers, glass mirrors, glass tubes, alcohol lamps, etc. (2) Quantitative analysis glassware, including graduated cylinders, pipettes, volumetric flasks, graduated cylinders, beakers, weighing devices.</p>
<p>Tour Sequence</p>
<p>(Furnace Room) The glass factory is similar to ordinary factories in that all products must be made in the furnace room. Therefore, the first step is for the engineer to mix the various raw materials and load them into boxes. These are then added to the furnace at the appropriate time and burned for more than ten hours, stirred continuously to melt them evenly. Then, the molten material is scooped out with iron or glass tubes, placed in iron molds to form the desired shape, and sent to the annealing oven. The temperature is gradually reduced over more than 24 hours before being removed. (Machine Room) Processing includes cutting, grinding, baking, engraving, etc. Another part is sent separately. (Natural Fire Room) Processing involves bending the tubes into shape. The reporters deeply praised these processes. The factory also prepared dozens of gifts to be distributed to the attendees.</p>

<h3>Hu Minggao, Impersonating a Lawyer, Receives a Reduced Sentence of Six Months</h3>
<p>Hu Minggao from Qidong was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for fraudulently using the lawyer's certificate of Wu Zhifen from Anhui to join the Shanghai Bar Association and practice law in Shanghai. This was discovered through a secret report and investigated by the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office. Hu appealed to the Jiangsu High Court for a third instance. The sentence from the first instance was then appealed for. The Jiangsu High Court has now issued a verdict which has now been handed down. The main points of the verdict of the Jiangsu High Court are excerpted below. Regarding the case of Hu Minggao impersonating lawyer Wu Zhifen, the main text of the verdict is that the original verdict and the verdict of the first instance are revoked.

<h3>Dispute over the Sale of Samsung Properties</h3>
<p>Zhou Bingcheng and Pang Zhongchen Accused</p>
<p>Zhou Bingcheng, manager of the Samsung Theater, and Pang Laichen (residing at 563 World Lane, Chengdu Road, Beijing Road), owner of the Rongzhang Paper Mill in Nanxun, have been accused of criminal embezzlement and breach of trust by Li Zhongxiang, owner of Fuchangxin Lime Store on Guangxi Road, and Zhang Shenru. They have hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court. The reasons for the lawsuit are that the property of the Samsung Real Estate Company, recently managed by Zhou Bingcheng, was jointly organized by the late Huang Chu Jiu, Zhao Ruquan, and Zhou Bingcheng. Therefore, all the assets of the company were jointly owned by the Huang family. Since Huang's death, it was agreed that the assets would be liquidated. All of Huang's assets were submitted to the Second Special District Court for execution. Therefore, Huang's property could not be disposed of by anyone without the court's disposition or the consent of all creditors. It has come to light that Zhou Bingcheng sold the Samsung company to Pang Laichen for 300,000 dollars, privately embezzling and dividing the profits, harming the interests of the plaintiffs. This violated Articles 357 and 367 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, the plaintiffs, as creditors of the company, request that the case be investigated and prosecuted according to the law, and additionally file a civil lawsuit requesting compensation for all damages incurred and confirmation that the sales transaction is invalid. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng summoned both defendants. Both defendants appeared. The plaintiffs Li Zhongxiang and others submitted their cases and detailed the above circumstances. When questioned, Zhou Bingcheng stated that the sale of the company was with the consent of Zhao Ruquan and the Huang family and sold to Pang Laichen for 270,000 dollars. Pang admitted to purchasing the company, claiming ignorance of the fact that Huang's property was included. Testimony at the court stated that the company was liquidated by accountant Pan Zhaobang. Therefore, the judge adjourned the case to investigate with accountant Pan before further verification.</p>
<p>###戴春林被控冒牌案判決無罪</p>
<p>The Dai Chunlin Dingji Perfume Shop on Fangbang Road in this city, which produces small boxes of rouge with the "Flying Energy" trademark, was once sued by the Xinhua Industrial Society because the trademark was similar to the "Flying Horse" trademark produced by the Xinhua Industrial Society.  However, someone came forward to mediate, and the case was withdrawn.  In August of this year, the court returned all the seized goods.  In June of this year, Dai Chunlin changed to a new design, using a flower pot as a trademark, and applied to the Trademark Bureau for registration in accordance with Article 37, Paragraph 3 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Trademark Law.  Subsequently, on July 23, the Trademark Bureau issued an approval, approving the rejection of Dai Chunlin's continued application for review.  The manager of Xinhua Industrial Society, Zha Zixiu, then sued Dai Chunlin for infringing on the trademark and requested investigation.  Prosecutor Li Fen's investigation found that Cao Yinmei, the manager of the store, had committed a crime under Article 268 of the Criminal Law, and a public prosecution was initiated.  Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Qianchang publicly tried the case in the Ninth Court.  The defendant, Wei Yinmei, hired lawyer Wang Jian to appear in court to defend him. As a result, the court announced the verdict, acquitting the defendant.</p>
<h3>Country Woman Meets Swindler on the Road, Deceived into Sex and Defrauded of Money, Apprehended and Requesting Investigation</h3>
<p>Jiang the Monk Seduced Chen Gu Shi</p>
<p>Chen Gu Shi from Jingjiang, 28 years old, came to Shanghai from the countryside this autumn in July to look for her husband, Chen Yifei (from Chongming), but failed to find him. She then temporarily resided with relatives who ran a teahouse at No. 7 Guyuefang, Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai. On the morning of August 2nd, Chen Gu Shi walked to the alley entrance of Jiaotong University, intending to take the No. 2 tram to Shanghai to look for her husband. She happened to meet Jiang the Monk, a tea customer who frequented the Guyuefang teahouse, also waiting for the tram.  He asked Chen Gu Shi where she was going, and she truthfully told him. Jiang, seeing that the country woman was easy to deceive, said, "I know Chen Yifei. I met him a few days ago somewhere. He is now a partner in a shop. I will take you there." She believed him and got off the bus at the Eight Immortals Bridge. He deceived her into a certain inn and forcibly raped her. The next morning, he also swindled her gold ring and 30 yuan in cash.  After waiting for a long time without him returning, she went back to her relatives' place in Guyuefang.  At the end of August, she took a boat back to her hometown. At the beginning of last month, Gu Shi received a letter from her husband, and she came to Shanghai for the second time, now living at No. 40 Maiqi Lane, Maiqi Road, French Concession. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, Jiang the Monk was walking in Xujiahui when he was spotted by her. She apprehended him and sent him to the police station at the third outpost, where officer Zhang Junlin took him back to the station. Chen Yifei also rushed over after receiving a letter. After questioning by Chief Hong, Chen Yifei and Chen Gu Shi recounted the previous events.  When questioned, the defendant Jiang the Monk, 39 years old, residing at No. 2 Youxiang Lane, Hongqiao Road, consistently denied the charges of seduction, rape, and fraud. The chief, noting the conflicting testimonies, ordered that the original plaintiff and the three defendants be sent to the bureau together with written statements for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Hezhong Banking Society</h3>
<p>The Hezhong Banking Society, recently located at the new address at the intersection of Broadway Road and Yuanchang Road, is preparing to hold its official opening as soon as the renovations are completed. It is heard that the society's purpose is to engage in various types of small credit loans, ranging from 50 yuan to 500 yuan, with low interest rates and simple procedures. Because when ordinary people in Shanghai encounter economic difficulties, they often resort to participating in mutual aid societies, bidding societies, or borrowing money at high interest rates as temporary saviors. Now, the society is implementing a system of borrowing and repaying in full for the general small business class, adding another helping hand to those in Shanghai who are suffering from economic pressure.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>The Land and Population of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zisheng</p>
<p>—In Response to Mr. Fang Qiuwei's Review of the Shen Bao Yearbook—</p>
<p>Mr. Fang Qiuwei, in a recently published article in "The Future Magazine" reviewing the Shen Bao Yearbook, stated in the preamble that it was "A Question to Zhang Qiyun Regarding the Status of the Northeast in China." Although I am the editor-in-chief of the Shen Bao Yearbook, I could have avoided answering criticisms directed specifically at the author. However, under the title of Mr. Zhang Qiyun's article, I noted that "...original recorded figures that conflict with the latest investigations by the company will be adjusted appropriately," and the figures regarding the land and population of the Northeast were precisely those that I adjusted and carefully checked; therefore, the "especially the errors in the land and population of the Northeast" mentioned by Mr. Fang in relation to that article should be my responsibility to answer – the entire question will of course be answered by Mr. Zhang Qiyun.</p>
<p>1.  Area of Land in Northeast China</p>
<p>In Mr. Zhang Qiyun's original manuscript, the figure for the land area of ​​the Northeast was "using miles as the unit and there was another number. Because the land area table of Shen Bao Yearbook had been agreed upon with several geographers to adopt the accurate figures calculated by Mr. Zeng Shiying as the standard; in order to unify the whole book, it was changed to "The area of ​​the whole of China is 11,173,558 square kilometers, and the area of ​​the four northeastern provinces is 1,285,075 square kilometers." Before Mr. Zeng's "Table of Areas of Provinces and Regions of the Country" has been revised, I cannot admit that the land area figures of the four northeastern provinces in the China Report Yearbook are "a big mistake." Since Mr. Fang has misread the national figures and the figures for the four northeastern provinces which are printed tomorrow in the book, and has also misused the Hua Fang Li figures reported by the Civil Affairs Office of the four provinces in the "Northeast Yearbook" for comparison, it is inevitable that he will feel "the difference is huge, and it cannot be measured in Daoli". Readers who read carefully, if they read the words in the article at the beginning of the 23rd Shen Bao Yearbook and pay attention to the conversion between Gong Fang Li and Hua Fang Li, they will naturally know the answer to the question of "how big is the land of the Northeast".</p>
<p>2.  Population of Northeast China</p>
<p>Regarding the population of the four northeastern provinces, the population compilation of the first Shen Bao Yearbook (1933 edition) adopted the figures from the Northeast Yearbook and the Asia New Geography Society; the second (1934 edition) used the report of the overseas consuls in September 1933 - a total of 30,092,900 people - see page 169 of the 1934 Shen Bao Yearbook. I initially wanted to change Mr. Zhang Qiyun's original manuscript of 35 million people, but later, due to the calculation of percentage values, I sent a letter to discuss it. Mr. Zhang replied based on the text on pages 6 to 9 of his book "The Economic Overview of Lost Land in the Northeast", thinking that there was no need to change it. I read the book carefully. I felt that this number also had its own basis, so I kept it as it was. The various statistical figures cited in Mr. Fang's article are mostly used as materials when discussing the population of the Northeast in the book; and they have been published in both Shen Bao Yearbooks. The reason why I did not modify Mr. Zhang Qiyun's figures was the result of reading the book "Economic Overview of Lost Land in the Northeast"; at first, like Mr. Fang, I intuitively thought that the figures "would undoubtedly be wrong."</p>
<p>3.  Shen Bao Yearbook Welcomes Criticism</p>
<p>Although I have explained the two points criticized by Mr. Fang above; I am very impressed by Mr. Fang's enthusiasm for hoping to improve the Shen Bao Yearbook. - Criticism is the mirror of the editor. The Shen Bao Yearbook is gradually moving towards precision. It needs the guidance of critics, and it needs concrete and practical instructions in the criticism.</p>
<p>As Mr. Fang said in the "Introduction to the Shen Bao Yearbook" in the World Daily on May 22, "Editing a yearbook is the most difficult thing." Although the colleagues of the Shen Bao Yearbook Society have done their best to work hard for two years, and sought help everywhere, after the completion of the two books, after the critics' instructions and their own review, they inevitably discovered some defects and errors. I know that it is necessary to obtain the assistance of experts and scholars from all over the country in order to compile a general yearbook that can satisfy people in China where various accurate materials are not easy to obtain. Now the third Shen Bao Yearbook is being revised, and I hope that those who cherish their reputation will not hesitate to provide materials in the active aspect to enrich the content. In the passive aspect, please send realistic critical texts for reference in the revision.</p>

<p>Special Issue for the 10th Anniversary of Great China University</p>
<p>— Inscription by Wang Boqun</p>
<h3>Publisher's Note</h3>
<p>— Wang Boqun</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Born in sorrow, die in ease." The life of an individual is like this, and so is the life of a group. Our Great China was born in June of the 13th year of the Republic of China. Initially, more than 300 students from Xiamen University, due to improper measures by the authorities that could not be salvaged, left the school together and came to Shanghai, requesting former Xiamen University professors Ou Yuanhuai, Wang Yuxiang, Chuan Shishuo, and others to establish a new school for them to continue their studies. And the professors were all able to shoulder the responsibility without hesitation, and based on the original intention of cooperation between teachers and students, they began to prepare for the new school, and named it Great China University, to commemorate the source of the school's history; is this spirit of struggle and sacrifice not commendable? However, at the beginning of the opening, the economic fundraising was very difficult, so all facilities were simple and crude, and the traces were unbearable. At that time, there were only more than 200 students; the school building on Xiaoshadu Road rented three floors above ground and three floors below ground, and all classrooms, offices, and laboratories were in it. The narrow situation was almost impossible to describe! However, the teachers and students of our Great China were able to move forward with the spirit of hard work, hard teaching, and hard study, and persevered. As of today, the school's progress is advancing by leaps and bounds. On the banks of Fanwangdu, thousands of acres of land are wide, and towering buildings are stacked up, and the atmosphere is new. The total number of faculty, staff, and students exceeds 2,000. The graduates who have served the society have been able to constantly improve themselves and have outstanding performance. All of this is the result of ten years of struggle in sorrow and hardship, and it is what we can be proud of.</p>
<p>Although university education is a matter of great importance. Our Great China has taken the task of glorifying China as its own responsibility, and the mission it bears is even more grand! If we do not establish a central goal, we will be building a car behind closed doors and will inevitably not be able to fit the track. Since the opening of the sea ban, the European and American imperialists have competed to bring their material civilization forces deep into China. They occupied our land, infringed on our sovereignty, exploited our people, and squeezed our economy; at the same time, they colluded with domestic soldiers to cause endless internal strife and disturbance. Eventually, they trapped our nation in the ranks of semi-colonies! At this time, when foreign insults are coming and the country is dying, if we do not awaken national consciousness and promote national spirit, how can we revive and abolish the decline? The university is the highest academic research institution, and if we continue to be complacent and step on the old ways, what good will it do to the current difficulties! This school examines the world's trends externally and observes the social environment internally, and deeply feels that university education in China at the current stage should take the restoration of the nation as its highest origin. Under this principle, the direction of our efforts can be divided into four: (1) Vigorously implement personality education to cultivate sound national morality. (2) Promote production education to rescue the dying national economy. (3) Encourage science education to develop the infinite natural treasures. (4) Implement national defense education to cultivate the nation's ability to defend itself. If we can stick to this goal and carry it through to the end, then the national self-confidence will be established, and the material construction force will gradually be enriched, and then the life of the entire nation can get rid of the shackles of imperialists and stand upright in the world of survival of the fittest. The meaning of this school's implementation of the education of restoring the nation lies in this.</p>
<p>Today is the 10th anniversary of this school. All teachers and students of the school, recall the hardships of the creation in those years, silently observe the greatness of the future mission. In addition to issuing special issues by the school's Great China Journal and Weekly Journal to commemorate the celebration, we also publish a commemorative special issue in various newspapers, listing the school's past historical development and future improvement plans, to inform the people of the country and to encourage ourselves. We are grateful for the titles or contributions from Chairman Lin, ministers of various ministries, and school directors, which have enhanced the content. We hope that all teachers and students will carry through the spirit of hard work, hard teaching, and hard study as always, recognize the current crisis of the nation, country, and society, and promote self-improvement and perseverance! At the same time, we also hope that domestic sages and heroes will continue to give instructions and support to our 10-year-old Great China child, so that it can realize the mission of saving the country and glorifying China. It is the fortune of my Great China, and it is also the fortune of the future of the nation and the country.</p>
<h3>Great China University's 10th Anniversary of Educating Talents</h3>
<p>— Lin Sen</p>
<h3>Great China University's 10th Anniversary, Glorifying My China</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhaoming</p>
<h3>The Formation of a New School Spirit at Great China University</h3>
<p>— He Yingqin</p>
<p>Recently, we often hear a disappointing cry, saying that China's school education is going bankrupt. This sentence sounds rather exaggerated at first; but if we savor the facts and achievements of school education in the past few years, we feel that it is reasonable. A part of our Chinese school spirit is really too bad, and this bad school spirit is getting worse day by day. This part of the bad school spirit was mostly formed gradually after the May Fourth Movement. The May Fourth Movement was a movement of national awakening, and it was a glorious product of the young students at that time. But at that time, the youth only had ideals, and there was no basis for the ideals. They pursued the new and enthusiastically admired the new culture of the West, but forgot that the new culture was produced in the old culture, and discarded everything in our Chinese culture. In this almost blind enthusiasm, they only absorbed the dross of the new Western culture. Human nature is easy to be evil and difficult to be good. Young people acted arbitrarily, and the school spirit became more and more arrogant, while the management of the schools became more and more relaxed. In recent years, many young people in schools spend their days there seeking happiness, and they simply don't know what it means to study knowledge and cultivate morality; some even shout slogans there, put up slogans, and are willing to be used by one or two unscrupulous elements in the education or political circles as soldiers for strikes and disturbances. The deterioration of the school spirit is too much.</p>
<h3>Great China University's 10th Anniversary Planting Trees and Cultivating Talents</h3>
<p>— Wu Jing Wish</p>
<p>Our Great China University has struggled and succeeded in the midst of hardship. Our purpose of establishing the school was to promote the movement of writing books. For the past ten years, the staff has worked hard, the teachers have taught hard, and the students have studied hard. A school spirit of simplicity, hard work, and hard study has long been cultivated. In October last year, it was decided to take national revival as the general goal of university education in the future, and listing the promotion of our country's inherent culture as the first step in the implementation outline. This kind of radical and forgetful youth mentality left over from the May Fourth Movement can be swept away. However, in the period of unprecedented national crisis, if we want to revive the nation, we must list several concrete goals and further cultivate our new school spirit in a practical way. In this way, we can shoulder the difficulties of the times and promote the Great China's spirit of establishing the school.</p>
<p>1.  Cultivate the spirit of sacrifice for the country and the nation</p>
<p>The weakness of our country is due to the fact that the majority of the people are too selfish and self-interested, and lack the concept of a nation and a country. All that is beneficial to the individual is sought at the expense of everything; if it is only beneficial to the nation and the country but not to the individual, then not only is it indifferent, but even tries to sabotage it in various ways. Our Great China University was created from the spirit of sacrifice. From now on, this spirit of sacrifice should be extended to the national and national aspects. We must make young students get rid of the inferior root of selfishness and self-interest, stimulate their love for the nation and the country, only know the great self of 400 million people united in sincerity, and not know the insignificant small self; if we encounter national crisis, everyone should have the determination to sacrifice the small self and save the great self.</p>
<p>2.  Strictly make teachers and students take responsibility</p>
<p>It is a matter of course that teachers are responsible for guiding and teaching, and students are responsible for diligent study. However, in some schools, teachers only seek to get by and perfunctorily do things. They listen to the bell, go to class, and leave class. They even try to please students in order to secure their jobs. Some think that being a teacher is a last resort. Students mostly aim to exchange diplomas for qualifications. They are unwilling to study and are only arrogant, lazy, extravagant, and form factions to create evil. The wind of hard teaching and hard study at our Great China University has been deeply ingrained. From now on, we should carefully select teachers who can take responsibility thoroughly, and should not use qualifications as the standard; the students' homework and morality should be managed absolutely strictly. We must know that the student era is definitely not an era of freedom. In the current serious national crisis, none of us has personal freedom, especially students should not be free. The students of our Great China should automatically take the responsibility of students and exchange freedom for the price of work.</p>
<h3>Great China University's 10th Anniversary Commemoration of the Civilization of Great China, October 1934</h3>
<p>— Dai Chuanxian respectfully congratulates</p>
<p>3.  Find ways to make the relationship between teachers and students closer</p>
<p>In most schools, teachers and students form two non-communicating barriers. Teachers teach for a year, but they still don't recognize the names of a few students; students listen to a year of classes, but they have never talked to a teacher once. As a result, the efficiency of teachers' teaching and the benefits of students' study are limited to a few short hours. After class, the relationship between teachers and students is over. This kind of separation can also make students feel that learning is boring and monotonous, and thus perfunctory and lazy. The banner of our Great China University was originally cooperation between teachers and students; the tutor system, which is now popular all over the country, was first advocated by our Great China University. From now on, we should strengthen cooperation and promote the tutor system, so that the feelings and thoughts of both teachers and students can be further closer, teachers can give sincere guidance, and students can accept it sincerely.</p>
<p>4.  Pay attention to popularizing physical education and military training</p>
<p>Chinese people have always been unconcerned about physical health, so there is a joke about the sick men of East Asia. Scholars even believe that being weak is the true color of a scholar. Now we have realized the importance of physical health, and we should focus on hygiene and exercise. However, physical education courses in schools are mostly equal to a formality. Even if there are a few schools famous for physical education, they only take competitive martial arts as the whole of physical education, and cultivating athletes is the only purpose. As for military training, it is even more of a formal affair, and even pampered soldiers cannot be trained. Our Great China University has implemented popular physical education since this semester, and pays special attention to the actual military life in military training. From now on, we should mobilize all students to carry out strict and disciplined training, so that every student has a healthy physique, a lively spirit, a habit of hard work, and a style of observing the law.</p>
<p>5.  Make students' lives adapt to social life</p>
<p>The gap between school and society is one of the biggest shortcomings of education in our country. The purpose of education is to create people who can be self-reliant and useful to society; if school and society are two completely different stages, how can a young person who comes out of school suddenly jump into society and apply himself? Many schools now are manufacturing the following two types of people: the first type is dreamers, who hold overly grand ideals, and have absolutely insufficient understanding and cultivation of the actual society; the second type is high-level vagrants, who don't even have the ability to daydream, They only care about eating well, dressing fashionably, and living comfortably. Outside of school, they go to tea houses and restaurants, and even go to dance halls to dance. They are ignorantly unaware that there is a completely different big society outside the school gate - in this big society, it is necessary to use great labor to fight for the right to live. We try to imagine that these two types of people, running into society, are not just parasites? Now the outcry of "graduation is unemployment" is rampant, but in fact, the most important reason for this "graduation is unemployment" is that the school has failed to train talents who can adapt to society. "Unable to reach the high, unable to reach the low," only shouting about unemployment. Our Great China University has long established a public education experimental zone to enable students to go to the countryside to serve. From now on, we should further make students' lives farmerized and adapt to the actual social life.</p>
<p>All the teachers and students of our Great China University! We should have great awareness and determination, take the nation and the country as the premise in everything, sacrifice personal freedom, and seek the freedom of the majority; and on the basis of our inherent culture and virtues, seek new development and creation. Our national spirit of hard work, the old virtues of filial piety, loyalty, trust, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the foundation of our Chinese nation's founding, and the reason why our Chinese nation has created a glorious history of four thousand years. We should follow the broad road taken by our ancestors and march forward with courage and self-confidence! At the same time, we should also carry through the spirit of establishing our Great China University, bury our heads in hard work, bury our heads in hard teaching, bury our heads in hard study, create a new school spirit, and prepare for the world's great unity by working hard day and night.</p>
<h3>Great China University's 10th Anniversary, For the Sake of Opening the World to Peace</h3>
<p>— Yu Youren</p>
<h3>大夏 University and National Revival Education</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>Da Xia University was founded in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China and has already passed through ten years. President Wang Yu-Gong is one of the school's directors and has sent a letter soliciting articles to commemorate the anniversary. I believe that Da Xia has, in its short ten-year history, progressed from a newly established school with pioneering spirit to one that is competing with other famous universities in the country. Its remarkable and splendid development deserves to be celebrated. Furthermore, at this critical juncture of national peril and cultural decline, Da Xia deeply feels the importance of its mission to cultivate talent for the country and upholds its consistent principle of saving the nation through education. Starting from last autumn, it has designated national revival as the central goal of education. This matter concerns the future of the country and the nation, and it is of utmost importance and significance. Therefore, it is necessary to explore it in detail. I am writing this article with the hope of discussing it with my fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>In the international arena of the 20th century, there is a dazzling phenomenon that leads to prosperity if followed, and ruin if defied, which is the development of national culture. Culture is the life force and expression of survival struggle of a nation. In terms of its "essence," it is the sum total of material and spiritual achievements of a nation in its efforts to cope with the environment, improve society, and strive for progress. In terms of its "function," it is a vital element for any nation seeking survival, prosperity, and development, which cannot be dispensed with even for a moment. Looking back at history and observing the changes in the world, the rise and fall, strength and weakness, and superiority and inferiority of all nations are all attributed to the prosperity or decline of their culture.</p>
<p>Our Chinese nation resides in the Asian continent and has been a nation of propriety and culture since ancient times, with a long and glorious history. Although it has been ravaged by foreign tribes several times, it has been able to maintain its great power without being assimilated. On the contrary, all foreign tribes that invaded our country were eventually assimilated by us. This is because the excellent culture of our Chinese nation made it possible. Examining the culture of the Chinese nation, in terms of spirit, it is "extremely great and strong, supremely impartial and upright," "intelligent and wise, sufficient to oversee; generous and gentle, sufficient to accommodate; vigorous and resolute, sufficient to execute; orderly and righteous, sufficient to command respect; cultured and meticulous, sufficient to distinguish." Therefore, it can traverse tens of thousands of miles and span thousands of years, exerting its innate intelligence to cope with complex environments, rectify the mind, cultivate the self, investigate things, and extend knowledge. As for material civilization, when the world was still in its infancy, in a state of primordial chaos, with people behaving like beasts, we had You Chao Shi teaching the people to build houses, Sui Ren Shi teaching the people to cook with fire, Fu Xi Shi teaching the people to fish and hunt with nets, Shen Nong Shi teaching the people to cultivate and plant crops, Huang Di creating boats and vehicles and building palaces, and Xia Yu controlling floods and benefiting the people's livelihood. Thus, they initiated the evolution of our country's society and elevated the common people. What is particularly worthy of boasting to the world is that the invention of printing, gunpowder, and the compass not only preceded ancient cultures but also served as a driving force for the promotion of Western culture when they were introduced to Europe in the Yuan Dynasty. Such examples are too numerous to mention, and these are just the more prominent ones.</p>
<h3>Da Xia University Tenth Anniversary Nurturing Talent for the Country</h3>
<p>— Sun Ke's Inscription</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since the Han Dynasty, scholars have advocated conservatism and rejected progress, focusing on textual criticism and sentence analysis. During the Jin and Wei Dynasties, and the Six Dynasties, the trend of Huang-Lao Daoism and empty talk was promoted, creating an extremely romantic and decadent nature. Later, the Tang Dynasty valued commentaries and sub-commentaries, the Song Dynasty valued metaphysics, the Ming Dynasty valued stereotyped essays, and the Qing Dynasty valued textual research. The thoughts of various schools were suppressed, and the pursuit of knowledge through investigation was despised. As a result, the inherent ability of our nation to create culture completely disappeared, and the scientific and artistic lifestyle, as well as the ability to organize the country and govern society, all declined. In modern times, metaphysical discussion and humor have become increasingly empty. Corruption and decadence have made the people's aspirations increasingly humble. They do not know how to conserve, nor can they create. The whole country is in a state of panic, feeling hopeless about the future, passively shrinking, and creating a society of complicity. The reasons for this are complex and diverse, but they are mainly due to the weakening of national self-confidence and material creativity. Today, in order to correct these malpractices and revive the nation-state, there is a cultural revival movement. The so-called cultural revival movement aims to enhance the self-confidence and creativity of our Chinese nation, recognize the glorious history of the nation in the past, to promote and amplify the excellent culture we share. At the same time, we should grasp the current stage of international turmoil, fierce competition for survival, and strive to study material science to meet the needs of time and space and seek adaptation. We should also build a new cultural system to complete the great mission of national revival.</p>
<h3>Da Xia University Tenth Anniversary A Heavy Responsibility and a Long Road Ahead</h3>
<p>— Wang Shijie's Inscription</p>
<p>The path to reviving the nation and building culture is certainly not limited to one aspect. The creation of culture, the preservation of national essence, the enlightenment of wisdom, the strengthening of physique, the cultivation of personality, and the promotion of national spirit all rely on education as the key to creation. University education, in particular, as the highest institution for cultivating talents and researching academics, has the mission of nurturing ideas, developing culture, and enabling the Chinese nation to adapt to time and space and continue to survive. At this time of national revival movement, how should the facilities of university education be determined in the future, so that we can relieve the national crisis and make great contributions to overcoming the difficulties of the times? This is what we should deeply understand and study. Now, let's discuss it:</p>
<p>1.  Cultivate the Spirit of Creation</p>
<p>Our Chinese nation was rich in the spirit of creating culture thousands of years ago, as has been said before. However, since the implementation of new education, we have been engaged in imitation, taking the imitation of others as an honor. Little do we know that the culture of a nation depends on its own creation and construction, and we cannot take the ready-made things of others for our own use. In the future, the scientific research of university education should analyze the inherent culture of the nation, understand its characteristics and shortcomings, and, based on the needs of modern society, make a precise evaluation of the essential values, and then create a unique culture of our Chinese nation. How to improve living methods, how to determine social organization, how to promote cultural development, and how to engage in national construction should all be based on local teaching materials as the original material and the current situation of China as the object. In this way, the culture of the national heritage and the academic knowledge of social public tools can be promoted and improved, scientific construction can be achieved, and national revival will not be in vain.</p>
<p>2.  Cultivate Scientific Skills</p>
<p>The goal of university education is to train specialized skills and improve real life, not just to be a tool for personal fame and gain. However, our nation has been bound by thousands of years of traditional thought, and the focus of education has always been on the cultivation of the spirit, with little emphasis on the art of benefiting the people's livelihood. Since the implementation of new education, this concept is still popular. School curriculum and equipment are mostly contrary to actual life. Students only know how to memorize books, without any real knowledge and practical skills. Therefore, they often lose their jobs in society once they graduate from school. In the future, the facilities of university education should pay more attention to the training of scientific skills. Instead of lecturing on empty theories, it is better to respond to actual needs. Instead of singing high-sounding tunes, it is better to conduct appropriate experiments. We must make the lives of young students reverse the morbid state of the past and conform to the principles of diligence and operation, using both hands and brains, and unifying knowledge and action. In this way, the skills of the profession are prepared, the guarantee of life is naturally solid, and the foundation of the country and society can be stabilized day by day, and the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce can be gradually developed.</p>
<h3>Da Xia Tenth Anniversary United Efforts Make a Strong Fortress</h3>
<p>— Respectfully Inscribed by He Yingqin</p>
<p>3.  Study National Defense Construction</p>
<p>The situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly urgent, and the global economic turmoil is becoming more intense. Once war breaks out, our "sick man of East Asia" will inevitably bear the brunt. If we do not prepare for the future and pay attention to national defense construction, how can we achieve independence and survive? National defense construction has a broad meaning. Specifically, in the present, it should be about how to revitalize industry and increase production. In the near future, it should be about how to enrich military science and recover lost land. In the distant future, it should be about how to open up the frontier and realize the status of the master of the Pacific. This work, on the one hand, must rely on the government's overall planning and control of the national economy and talent. On the other hand, it must rely on the power of education to cultivate national heroes and leaders. Therefore, when it comes to university education today, in addition to striving for the dissemination of ordinary knowledge, the strengthening of physical fitness, and the cultivation of noble personality, we must have a thorough and precise study of military science, national defense policy, and wartime economy, so as to cultivate their quick and skillful skills. At the same time, students should deeply understand the legacy of great figures in history, the glorious deeds of heroes and patriots who struggled for the country, nurture their psychology of independence and self-respect, perseverance, the will to fight against the enemy, and the spirit of dedication. Only then can they be cultivated into talents who serve the country, and not fail the main purpose of education in extraordinary times.</p>
<p>The above three points are the fundamental principles for reviving national education, and the facilities for this education are the basic work for saving the country and the nation, which is not the sole responsibility of Da Xia University. It is hoped that those who are responsible for university education will strive to move forward from the fundamental construction, and consistently pursue this goal from beginning to end. Although we cannot expect immediate results, the future lifeline of the country depends on it!</p>
<h3>Historical Development of Da Xia University</h3>
<p>— Wang Yuxiang</p>
<p>1.  Introduction</p>
<p>Da Xia has been around for ten years. When we think of the difficulties of founding the school ten years ago, the current situation of more than two thousand teachers and students gathering together, and the seriousness of the national crisis in the universe, we feel that Da Xia will bear a great mission in the future. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the conference, I would like to give a general review of the development of Da Xia in the past ten years, and share it with the people, and encourage myself.</p>
<p>2.  The Process of Founding Da Xia University</p>
<p>A. The Meaning of "June 1st"</p>
<p>In May of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, there were 300 university students. Because the measures of the authorities were improper, they rose up to seek remedy, but were not listened to. And a part of the faculty and staff, taking advantage of the opportunity, blinded the president and added oppression, and a great wave arose. The students appealed for ten days, and their voices were hoarse. On June 1, the staff of the Construction Department again led the workers to poison the students Jiao Shiqing, Lei Rongpu, Sun Zuojin, etc. All the students, motivated by righteousness, had no choice but to leave the school, fearing that they would lose their studies halfway and deviate from their original aspirations. They elected representatives He Zhongyan, Ni Wenya, Sun Kangzeng, Shi Naizhu and other fourteen people to Shanghai to request former Xiamen University professors Ou Yuanhuai, Wang Yuxiang, Chuan Shishuo, Yu Zelan, Li Shiqiong, Lin Tianlan, Wu Yuteng, Lü Zifang, Zhou Xuezhang and other nine people to prepare for the new school so that they could get a place to study. Therefore, Da Xia will use this sensational June 1st as the founding anniversary from now on. From this, it can be known that</p>
<p>The "June 1st" commemoration actually contains three important meanings: resisting the powerful and sacrificing blood, building a new school for the reading movement, and supporting justice and teacher-student cooperation.</p>
<p>B. The Naming of "Da Xia"</p>
<p>The cause of the Xiamen University student tide was actually caused by the regional resentment of a part of the faculty and staff. The professors who left the school, at the request of the students, prepared for the new school, and borrowed No. 24 Meiren Lane, Beidi'ao Road, Shanghai as the preparation office, and named the new school "Da Xia". On the one hand, it records the origin of the school history, and on the other hand, it implies the meaning of "carrying forward the glory of China". It is said that "If you can be Xia, you must be great." Da Xia University is a great university. In the future, chasing Harvard and competing with Oxford depends on the self-improvement of all our teachers and students.</p>
<p>C. The Organization of the Board of Directors</p>
<p>After the establishment of the new school preparation office, Mr. Wu Shihui often came to discuss school matters. He once said that at the beginning of running a school, the current problem lies in how to enable students to study and graduate, and there is no need to stick to the form of the school. His words were very encouraging, and the colleagues were deeply grateful. Therefore, five departments of Literature, Science, Education, Commerce, and Preparatory were established. After the plan was determined, Wu Zhihui, Wang Jingwei, Zhang Junmai, Wang Boqun, Ye Chucang, Ma Junwu, Shao Lizi and other gentlemen were invited to be the directors of the school to establish the board of directors as the representative of the school. And Mr. Wang Boqun donated 2,000 yuan for start-up expenses. At that time, the situation of struggling to make ends meet is still vivid in my mind.</p>
<h3>Ten Years to Grow Trees, A Hundred Years to Nurture People</h3>
<p>— Ju Xin</p>
<p>D. The Process of Approving the Record</p>
<p>At the beginning of the school, No. 201 Xiaoshadu Road was rented as a temporary school building. The narrowness of the buildings and the simplicity of the equipment were inevitable. However, the school is a product of the reading movement, and teachers and students can all uphold the "three hardships spirit" - teachers teach hard, staff work hard, and students study hard - and strive for cooperation, so it has won the support of many people in the community. In March of the fourteenth year, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to the school to inspect, and recognized that the school "teachers and management were serious, and the academic style and results were excellent." On July 28 of the same year, the Ministry of Education approved the record for trial operation. In the spring of the eighteenth year, the school purchased more than 300 acres of the new campus site in Fanwangdu, and the material foundation was more solid. On April 6, the Ministry of Education approved the board of directors to register. On April 30, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to the school for inspection again, and was satisfied with all aspects of the school's measures. Therefore, on May 17 of the eighteenth year, it approved the official registration. After that, our school worked harder and became one of the famous universities in the country.</p>
<p>3.  Evolution of Administrative Organization</p>
<p>The administrative system of the school has undergone four changes. The first phase was the committee system, the second phase was the president system, the third phase was the committee system again, and the fourth phase was the president system again. At the beginning of the establishment of the school in the thirteenth year, because the directors of the schools were scattered in various places, it was not easy to gather. Therefore, Ou Yuanhuai, Wang Yuxiang, and Chuan Shishuo and other three professors were temporarily appointed as executive secretaries to hire the first phase of teachers. After the school started, the school affairs became more complicated, so Lu Jizeng, Xu Zhang, and Zhang Menglin were added to the school affairs conference to maintain the school affairs. On November 22, the first board of directors was convened, and Dr. Ma Junwu was elected as the president, and Mr. Wang Boqun was elected as the chairman of the board of directors. In January of the sixteenth year, President Ma firmly resigned due to the relationship with Guangxi University. At that time, the National Government promoted the committee system, and the school changed the president system to the committee training, and Mr. Wang Boqun was elected as the chairman of the university committee by the board of directors, and the school affairs administration committee was changed to the university committee, which was organized by ten members. In March of the seventeenth year, in accordance with the school regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education, the committee system was changed to the president system again. Mr. Wang Boqun was elected as the president by the board of directors, and Mr. Ou Yuanhuai was the vice president. At the same time, the university committee was changed to the school affairs conference. Up to now, there has been no change, and the administrative foundation has become more consolidated.</p>
<p>4.  Changes in School Buildings</p>
<p>The school buildings have undergone three moves. During the preparation period, it was at No. 24 Meiren Lane, Beidi'ao Road, French Concession, Shanghai. At the beginning of the school, No. 201 Xiaoshadu Road was rented as a temporary school building, with three floors and three bottoms, shaped like an ancient temple. All classrooms, offices, laboratories, and libraries were in it. The dormitory was in Zhiheli, Robison Road, and the road in front of the house was used as a basketball court. The author could not name it, and once named it the Jumping Era. In the summer of the fourteenth year, the May 30th Massacre occurred, and British soldiers pressed the border and occupied our school building. The school moved to the Pan Family Ancestral Hall in Binlang Road to work in the two doormen. They also negotiated with the Pan family landlord to borrow land to build a school building, and after several twists and turns, they finally got their wish. In the autumn, they moved to the school building at No. 301 Jiaozhou Road for classes, and rented more than 20 acres of vacant land next to the school as a sports field. Later, the number of students increased sharply, and a dormitory was added on the opposite side of the Jiaozhou Road school building, and two small classrooms were added. A piece of land was rented on the left side of Robison Road to build a girls' dormitory. At this time, the environment was better, because all the houses and land were rented, so it was once named the "Cherish the Light Era". In this "Borrowing Light Era", it has been five years. It was not until Di in the nineteenth year that he moved to the self-built new school building of the "Mansion Era" in Fanwangdu. The scale is magnificent, the school grounds are empty, the air is fresh, and the environment is quiet. It is a paradise for young students to study.</p>
<h3>Da Xia University Tenth Anniversary Nurturing People</h3>

<p>5.  Concluding Remarks</p>
<p>The above is only a brief report on the founding process of our Da Xia, the evolution of the administrative organization, and the changes in the school buildings. Other important developments and improvements of various departments will be described in special articles, so I will not repeat them here. But there is an ancient saying: "Worry and labor can prosper the country, and idleness and pleasure can destroy oneself." "People are born in worry and die in happiness." Individuals are like this, countries are like this, and groups are also like this. Remembering the past and looking forward to the future, I feel the danger of the national revival of our country and encourage myself even more. In the winter of the twenty-second year, the outline of national revival education was formulated and implemented, with a period of three years, as the central goal of the efforts of all teachers and students of the school. The Yi Jing says: "Its demise, its demise, is hit by the mulberry." At this time of national crisis, who will be the maintainer of the mulberry? The spirit of struggle, sacrifice, and creation of our Da Xia is not the pearl of our nation's survival.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Current Situation of Da Xia University</h3>
<p>— Chuan Shishuo</p>
<p>1.  School Buildings</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the school in June of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, all the school buildings have been rented until the autumn of the nineteenth year. The situation of trudging is self-evident. In the spring of the eighteenth year, President Wang, in view of the advancement of school affairs and the sharp increase in students, resolutely took the construction of permanent school buildings as his own responsibility. He raised funds one after another to purchase more than 300 acres of school land beside Zhongshan Road in Fanwangdu. On New Year's Day of the nineteenth year, he broke ground and built the first phase of the school building, which was completed in September. There is a large classroom, named Qunxian Hall, which is a three-story steel-concrete building with a flat roof in the shape of a character. The lower floor is the office, and the second and third floors are classrooms, which can accommodate 2,000 students. There are two male dormitories, named Quncezhai and Qunlizhai, which are three-story gray brick buildings in the shape of a concave character, each of which can accommodate 720 students. There is a girls' dormitory, named Qunyingzhai, which can accommodate 400 students. In addition, there is a canteen, a bathroom, a temporary auditorium, and four temporary classrooms and offices. At the end of the year, three faculty and staff dormitories were built, totaling 72 rooms, and a temporary science museum was built. In the summer of the twentieth year, a sanatorium and a temporary library were added. In the summer of the twenty-third year, because the large and middle departments shared the school building, it was inconvenient for teaching and management. Therefore, more than 30 acres of land was allocated to the east of the school river and south of the sports field to build a new school building for the affiliated Da Xia Middle School, including an office hall and two classrooms in the shape of a product. It was completed in the autumn and the class was moved to the upper floor.</p>
<p>2.  School Scenery</p>
<p>The school is located beside Zhongshan Road in Fanwangdu, Xihai, Shanghai, covering an area of more than 300 acres. The layout of the school is in the style of a garden. The southernmost is Da Xia New Village, with clear water and weeping willows on both banks. The faculty and staff dormitories are hidden among them. To the north of the village is the girls' dormitory Qunyingzhai, to the east of the hall is the library, and to the north is the forest area. The trees are shaded and the old trunks reach the sky, mixed with countless elm, poplar, peach and willow trees. Crossing the forest area and crossing a small bridge to the north is a large square, which can be 30 acres, with flagpoles erected in the middle, surrounded by shrubs, and the edges are like carpets, which can be used for rest after class. To the north of the square is Qunxian Hall, and to the east and west of the hall are the male dormitories Qunce and Qunli Halls. To the north are the temporary auditorium, science museum, after-school club, bathroom, artesian well machine room, and sanatorium. In front of the hospital is a lotus pond, which can be several acres in size, with lotus leaves and fish playing east and west. It is enough to travel around and enjoy the scenery. From the sanatorium to the school river (that is, Liwa Lida River, donated to the school by Mr. Rong Zongjing), the plains are vast and boundless, which is the large sports field. In the northeast corner of the school river, across a small bridge, is a small island, with winding rivers and clear water that can be seen. The graduates who served the school built a pavilion on it, named "Xia Yu", which can be used for rest. To the south of the sports field is the school building of the affiliated Da Xia Middle School, which is beautiful and magnificent. Looking down at the whole school, there are ancient trees, plains, clear streams, and ponds. There is no noise of the city, and it is rich in natural scenery. It is indeed a good place for young people to study.</p>

<p>— Respectfully Inscribed by Pan Zhizhan</p>
<p>3. University Affairs</p>
<p>A. Reorganization of the Board of Trustees: The Board of Trustees of this university was established in the autumn of the thirteenth year [of the Republic], and formally registered in April of the eighteenth year. Last year, in December, it was reorganized in accordance with the revised regulations for private schools promulgated by the Ministry [of Education]. The current list of trustees is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Trustees: Mr. Wang Boqun (Chairman of the Board), Wang Zhixin, Wang Zhiwei, He Yingqin, Jiang Wenyu, Wu Tiecheng, Du Yong, Zhang Zhuping, Yang Yongtai, Chuan Shi Shuo, and Ou Yuanhuai.</p>
<p>2. Honorary Trustees: Mr. Wang Yiting, Wu Zhihui, Wu Yunzhai, Wang Jingwei, Huang Shaoxiong, Ren Jisheng, Shao Lizi, He Zongyan, Zhou Ziliang, Hu Mengjia, Hu Wenhu, Liang Luanan, Xu Xinliu, Xu Jilu, Chen Guangfu, Ma Junwu, Zhang Junqin, Zhang Gongquan, Huang Suchu, Ye Chucang, Rong Zongjing, Yu Qiaqing, Zhao Jinqing, Zhao Hengti, Liu Wenyao, Liu Shufan, Qian Xinzhi, Dai Peiji, and Dai Zengyuan.</p>
<p>B. System of Administrative Organization: The Board of Trustees is the highest authority of the university, and its main functions are to raise university funds and elect the president and vice president, etc. The president is the head of administration and also the chairman of the university affairs meeting. The vice president assists the president in handling university affairs. Under the president, there is a university secretary, a dean of academic affairs, a chief accountant, a chief of general affairs, a dean of student life, deans of various colleges, heads of various departments, a registrar, a librarian, and a director of the affiliated Great China Middle School, one person each. The university affairs meeting is composed of the above-mentioned personnel and three faculty representatives. Under the university affairs meeting, there are six committees: examination, academic affairs, finance, general affairs, library, and student life guidance. The president, dean of academic affairs, chief accountant, chief of general affairs, librarian, and dean of student life serve as ex officio chairmen. Each committee is further divided into groups to handle affairs according to the complexity of its responsibilities, in order to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>C. Departments and Programs of Each College</p>
<p>1. The College of Liberal Arts has three departments: Chinese Studies, English, and History and Sociology.</p>
<p>2. The College of Science has three departments: Mathematics and Physics, Chemistry, and Civil Engineering.</p>
<p>3. The College of Education has three departments: Educational Administration, Educational Psychology, and Social Education.</p>
<p>4. The College of Commerce has four departments: Banking, Accounting, Transportation, and Business Management.</p>
<p>5. The College of Law has three departments: Law, Political Science, and Economics.</p>
<p>6. The Teacher Training Program is divided into four groups: Chinese, English, History and Geography, and Mathematics and Physics.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation of Academic Performance: The university evaluates students' academic performance based on the principle of emphasizing both quality and quantity. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>1. (Credit): One hour of lecture per week, two hours of self-study, for a full semester constitutes one credit.</p>
<p>2. (Grade): Credits measure quantity, grade points measure quality. Grade points are determined by the grade. If the grade is first class, the grade point is 3; if the grade is second class, the grade point is 2; if the grade is third class, the grade point is 1; fourth-class and fifth-class grades receive no grade points, and fifth-class grades also receive no credits. This is calculated for a one-credit course. The rest can be inferred by analogy.</p>
<p>3. Index: The ratio of credits to grade points is the index. The total grade points for a semester are divided by the total number of credits to obtain the semester's total index. The total grade points earned over four years are divided by the total credits earned to obtain the graduation index.</p>
<p>E. Student ID Number Assignment: Starting this semester, student ID numbers will be assigned. Each student has a student ID number, which will never change once assigned. All registration forms must include the student's ID number for verification and to facilitate teaching.</p>
<p>F. Establishment of Special Lectureships: With the loss of the Northeast and the increasing national crisis, the way to save the nation depends on education. In view of this, the university established various special lectureships in the autumn of the twenty-first year [of the Republic], inviting academic experts from inside and outside the university to give systematic lectures. The lectureships established successively include: 1. Lectureship on Education for National Salvation; 2. Lectureship on National Defense Chemistry; 3. Lectureship on Sino-Japanese Relations; 4. Lectureship on Controlled Economy; 5. Lectureship on Pacific Issues; and the Lectureship on International Issues and the Lectureship on Borderland Issues, which are offered this semester.</p>
<p>G. Expansion of Scholarship Funds</p>
<p>1. University Scholarships: Twenty scholarships per semester, each worth twenty yuan. Students from all colleges and departments who have excellent conduct and an academic index of 2.5 or higher are eligible.</p>
<p>2. Ou Family Scholarship: This spring, Mr. Ou, the vice president of the university, celebrated the seventieth birthday of his respected father, Mr. Jianbo. He generously donated 5,000 yuan from the birthday gifts to establish a scholarship fund for the university. Starting this autumn, the bank will withdraw 500 yuan in interest annually to award scholarships to six students: four university students, each receiving 100 yuan; and two middle school students, each receiving 50 yuan.</p>
<p>3. Private Scholarships: The number of scholarships is not fixed. The criteria for awarding scholarships are specified by the donors and awarded after approval by the university affairs meeting.</p>
<p>4. Special Scholarships: Divided into five categories: Special Topic Research Grants, Speech and Debate Awards, Chinese and English Joint Examination Awards, and All-Around Excellence Awards. The number of scholarships is not fixed and is funded by the fines collected from students who register late each semester.</p>
<p>4. Facilities</p>
<p>A. Library Facilities: The university library currently has a total collection of 32,412 Chinese and Western books and 384 Chinese and Western periodicals. An annual allocation of 10,000 yuan is designated for the purchase of books. The library's reading rooms are divided into seven sections: (1) Reference Reading Room, (2) General Reading Room, (3) Periodical Reading Room, (4) Newspaper Reading Room, (5) Faculty Reading Room, (6) Educational Research Room, and (7) Middle School Collection.</p>
<p>B. Science Facilities</p>
<p>1. Physics Facilities: There are three rooms for the general physics laboratory and storage. There are more than 600 types of measurement instruments, optical instruments, mechanical instruments, thermal instruments, and musical instruments.</p>
<p>2. Chemistry Facilities: There are four laboratories for general chemistry, analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, and industrial chemistry, which can accommodate more than 260 students. In addition, there are three rooms for balances, air, gas, and storage. There are more than 1,780 pounds of inorganic and organic acids, salts, and bases; more than 12,890 pieces of various glassware; more than 580 pieces of automatic distilled water apparatus, high and low-temperature electric furnaces, melting furnaces, thermometers, and hydrometers; and more than 1,200 specimens and charts.</p>
<p>3. Biology Facilities: There are one laboratory, one specimen room, and one storage room. There are 40 microscopes, more than 400 human body models, more than 800 animal specimens, and more than 650 pieces of glassware.</p>
<p>4. Psychology Facilities: There is one laboratory that can accommodate 60 students. There are 32 instruments and 130 charts for experimental psychology.</p>

<p>C. Physical Education Facilities: The men's sports field is located on the west side of the campus, covering an area of more than 50 mu. It has six tennis courts, four basketball courts, and one soccer field. The soccer field is surrounded by a 400-meter running track, which can accommodate eight people running side by side. Outside the track, there are horizontal bars and other sports equipment and field event facilities. The volleyball court is located south of Qunce Hall, covering more than 10 mu. The women's sports field, located south of Qunying Hall, has two tennis courts, one basketball court, and one volleyball court. The northwest corner of Qunying Hall has two tennis courts and one basketball court. There are also various other sports equipment.</p>
<p>The above is a glimpse of the current state of the university. Due to space limitations, it is not exhaustive. We recall that ten years ago, at the beginning of the university's founding, the roads were rough and the buildings were rudimentary, and there were countless difficulties. Now, the school buildings have been renovated, and the atmosphere is completely new. Reflecting on the past and thinking about the present, we are truly gratified! However, university education is a difficult and heavy responsibility. The university's current construction is only the beginning, and the goal of success is still far away. On the occasion of this tenth anniversary celebration, in addition to rejoicing and being encouraged, we must maintain the spirit of cooperation between teachers and students in the past and strive to promote university affairs in the future.</p>
<h3>Great China University's Future Development Direction</h3>
<p>— Ou Yuanhuai</p>
<p>Great China University, which was painstakingly managed through the cooperation of teachers and students, has now been born for ten years. Those with knowledge of its contributions to society and the nation will have a fair judgment, which need not be elaborated upon. However, looking back over the past ten years, thanks to the support and assistance of people from all walks of life and the efforts of all teachers and students, university affairs have progressed by leaps and bounds. The number of students has increased dramatically, from 200 to over 2,000; the campus has been relocated five times, and the scale has become even larger, from having no place to stand to owning 300 mu of land; the school buildings have gone from a few low houses to wide buildings connected to the clouds; 1,500 graduates are serving in various provinces and cities in China and the Nanyang Islands, and more than 100 have studied abroad, with outstanding achievements, which are visible to all. While this may not be considered to have reached the ultimate goal, it is still satisfactory and somewhat comforting to those who care about Great China University. As one of the founders and having assisted in university administration for many years, I dare not fail to discuss the plans for future development on the occasion of this tenth anniversary. However, planning is not difficult, implementation is difficult. Many plans in the past have not been realized, either due to financial constraints or lack of talent. Therefore, today, I will not aim too high but only briefly describe the most urgent constructions, for the reference of those who care about Great China University's affairs, and also as a compass for self-vigilance.</p>
<p>A. Regarding Future Policy Guidelines</p>
<p>Administrative facilities are valuable in facilitating teaching. While the university's administration has achieved many special achievements in recent years, there are still some shortcomings that do not meet the ideal. The current plan is to build on past strengths and find ways to make up for the deficiencies. Specifically, there are the following four points that should be paid attention to and implemented.</p>
<p>(1) Strive for Administrative Rationalization</p>
<p>For daily administration and all development plans, scientific methods should be used to conduct careful investigations and designs in advance, establish administrative calendars for each department, and implement them on schedule to improve efficiency. Departmental reports should also be implemented to achieve mutual supervision. In particular, as the university's finances are not very generous, all administrative expenses must strictly adhere to a policy of austerity to reduce unnecessary waste, directly reduce the school's burden, and indirectly increase educational effectiveness. At the same time, intelligence, morality, physical education, group activities, and aesthetics should be developed equally. No matter how important the facilities are, detailed plans and descriptions must be prepared and submitted to the university affairs meeting for review, in order to gather wisdom and expand benefits and give full play to the functions of the meeting system. Even students' suggestions for improving university affairs should be adopted within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>(2) Maintain the Spirit of Hard Work</p>
<p>This university is a private school. The most formidable enemy of private schools can be summed up in one word: economic pressure. However, the birth of this university is to strive to cultivate talents for the country and to work hard for academic construction, maintaining the spirit of hard work from day to day for ten years. There is no need to worry about financial difficulties, and there is no need to fear the harsh environment. Each time we encounter danger, this spirit becomes stronger and stronger, and we are finally able to safely navigate the stormy seas. This is none other than the result of the spirit of hard work. Although the university's foundation has been established, it is still far from our ideal. In the future, all teachers and students should not only uphold the spirit of sacrifice, struggle, perseverance, and progress, but also carry it forward and make it greater. Teachers should teach diligently, staff should work diligently, and students should study diligently. With concerted efforts, we should cultivate a study style of "unceasing self-improvement" and hard work, temper its edge, and advocate it to schools across the country. From ten years, twenty years, fifty years, one hundred years, to even a thousand years, we will make "new things emerge from the grindstone" become the permanent school motto of our university.</p>
<h3>Qunxian Hall (Large Lecture Hall)</h3>
<p>(3) Strive for Teacher-Student Cooperation</p>
<p>Since its founding, our university has paid attention to teacher-student cooperation. We strive to make the entire university environment like a family between fathers, sons, brothers, and sisters. Teachers cooperate with students, teachers cooperate with teachers, and students cooperate with students. Whether it is improving university affairs, consulting on opinions, exploring academics, or solving problems, we all treat each other with sincerity. There is no deceit, and we abandon the small self to achieve the greater self, like the fusion of water and milk. We only see proactive suggestions and never hear negative criticisms. Therefore, university affairs can develop rapidly and become more and more perfect. However, the mission of university education is solemn, and future construction is still in progress. All our teachers and students should continue to work hard in accordance with the principle of "many voices make a city," and never lose sight of it. Regarding the university's current facilities and future improvement plans, we should not shirk our responsibility. Under the principle of maintaining the university itself, we should contribute our opinions and work together to promote progress. Only then can group life be maintained without decay, and the future of the university will be further developed and magnified. This is the awareness we should have and the further efforts that need to be made.</p>
<h3>Qunce Hall (One of the Men's Dormitories)</h3>
<p>(4) Establish Close Ties with Society</p>
<p>The university is society, and education is life. "Building a cart behind closed doors, its wheels will not fit the ruts," this is what the ancients warned against and what today's educators should pay close attention to. In the past, our university focused on internal consolidation and was somewhat lacking in contact with society. The current plan is to pay attention to social ties in many ways. There are four ways to establish ties: (1) Demonstrate with practical achievements and win social sympathy. (2) Connect with parents. Combined investigations and interviews, regularly report the university's situation and the student's academic performance to their family in writing; and solicit suggestions for improvement in all aspects, in order to achieve the effectiveness of cooperation between school education and family education. (3) Unite alumni. Conduct a detailed survey of their service in society, as a compass for facility construction; and make full use of school publications to communicate alumni news at any time, and introduce appropriate occupations, guide or solve their difficult problems as much as possible. (4) Serve the community. Establish a department for inquiries on social and scientific issues, and make full use of the Great China People's Education Experimental Zone facilities and methods, leading nearby people to improve crops, build hospitals and roads, and run all public welfare undertakings. At the same time, lead students to enthusiastically participate in social culture and national salvation movements, training their skills on the one hand and improving their service spirit on the other.</p>
<p>B. Regarding Material Construction Plans</p>
<p>Material construction is still an important plan for our university today. However, what we should strive for at present is to continue the unfinished work of the past, complete the basic construction and equipment, and not take a luxurious and extravagant approach. This aspect can also be divided into the following two items:</p>
<p>(1) Complete Basic Construction</p>
<p>Our university's current classrooms and dormitories are quite magnificent and solid. This season, three new middle school buildings have been built and a science hall has been expanded. The atmosphere along the Fanwangdu Pier is completely new. In the next three to five years, classrooms and science laboratories should be sufficient. However, due to economic limitations, a general office has not been built separately, and it is temporarily located downstairs in Qunxian Hall. Recently, the number of students has increased, and various research laboratories have been established one after another, and it feels that it is not enough to allocate. Furthermore, a permanent library and a covered playground are still lacking, which is particularly regrettable. The above construction is of utmost importance to administrative efficiency and teaching and training. We hope that the board of trustees and all teachers and students will work hard to plan and work together to promote progress. Based on past history, it should not be difficult to complete this mission in a short period of time.</p>
<p>(2) Enrich Various Equipment</p>
<p>The university is a research institution for higher learning. It is not only about attending classes and copying notes, but also about paying attention to extracurricular reading and experimentation. However, to engage in large-scale experimental research, the university's current books and instruments are still insufficient. In addition to continuing to expand the designated funds each year, it is planned to hold a donation campaign in the shortest possible time. In addition, the addition of sports equipment and the expansion of sanitary facilities should be actively planned and implemented as soon as possible. As for the two major book bureaus, Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Company, which are permanently lending various precious books, instruments, specimens, and models, totaling more than 5,000 items, and the Educational Museum's History and Geography Social Research Office compiling newspaper indexes, are all solid research work and are worth expanding and striving for.</p>
<p>C. Regarding Teaching and Guidance Improvement Policies</p>
<p>Chinese people often have a wrong idea that middle and primary schools should pay more attention to teaching and training, and that universities are free to study and research, and there is no need to investigate teaching methods. Training is even more irrelevant. As a result, professors often teach their books, and students are at a loss to understand the profoundness. The study style is weak and discouraged, and the floating and romantic phases are followed as usual. Those who can self-restrain, struggle, and work hard are rare and cannot be seen more often. Is there any hope for a bright future for academic prospects! Therefore, the improvement of teaching and guidance is an urgent task that cannot be delayed. The main points are described below.</p>
<p>(1) Establish Teaching Guidelines</p>
<p>Teaching should have guidelines so that there is something to follow and not to aim at nothing. The university should establish teaching guidelines in the future: (1) Each subject should focus on promoting national revival, and all courses should have systematic connections. (2) The compilation of teaching materials should be based on localism, striving to meet the needs of the national conditions, and be knowledge and skills that are in line with modern life. (3) Use various excellent teaching methods to implement rigorous training, in order to increase educational efficiency and improve students' level. (4) Pay attention to health education to train the body and mind of young people. (5) Cultivate the spirit of struggle and creation.</p>
<p>(2) Strive for Production Education</p>
<p>Production education is of utmost importance to the enrichment of national livelihoods and the revitalization of rural education. Furthermore, the western suburbs of Shanghai are vast and the villages are densely populated, and there are many resources that can be used. The university plans to add agricultural and industrial colleges in the near future. This season, a production education teacher training class will be added to the College of Education to train teachers for vocational supplementary schools and labor teachers for primary and secondary schools. Currently, all plans and courses are being drafted in detail, and a preparatory committee has been organized to conduct large-scale discussions on production education, as a basis for national revival. We hope that all teachers and students will work hard to promote it!</p>
<p>(3) Promote Universal Physical Education</p>
<p>The strength of the physique is of utmost importance to the rise and fall of the nation. However, the common problem of general universities in recent years is to focus on competition and ignore the physical training of the majority of students, so that young people do not like sports and their spirits are weak. In order to promote universal physical education this season, the university has greatly expanded the sports field and sports equipment, and stipulates that morning exercises and extracurricular sports are compulsory courses for all students, and provides different training according to their abilities, genders, and seasons. We must ensure that each student has the opportunity to properly exercise their body, in order to cultivate a healthy physique and establish a foundation for the revival of China.</p>
<p>(4) Implement Cooperative Training and Teaching</p>
<p>Our university has always advocated cooperative training and teaching. The implementation of the mentor system dates back six years, which was the beginning of universities nationwide. Over the years, it has been quite effective. Starting this semester, the original system will be improved. All students in each college of the university and the teachers' special courses will be arranged in groups according to their major and minor departments, and more than 30 mentors will be assigned to provide practical guidance. The guidance period is from the student's enrollment to graduation; the scope is roughly divided into self-study, autonomy, health, and social service; the methods, in addition to not violating the principles of training and the university's school motto, can be freely determined by the mountain instructor, and the form is not limited: the mentor can make an appointment for group or individual talks with each student, or the student can raise personal questions at any time and ask the mentor. We must implement the new life in order to nurture a sound central idea and prepare for serving society and the country in the future. This is also one of the ends of reviving national education.</p>
<p>(5) Promote Academic Creation</p>
<p>Our university is one of the highest institutions of learning in the country, and with the New Culture Movement as its background, it should cultivate a atmosphere of academic research and be a model for general universities. In the future, the university should actively expand books and instruments, add various research laboratories, hold academic lectures, and increase scholarship funds, in order to promote research spirit, stimulate creative psychology, pay attention to extracurricular experiments, and encourage topic research. Teachers should also redouble their efforts in imparting social knowledge and training scientific skills, and pay attention to identifying geniuses at any time, in order to create outstanding leaders. However, the promotion of external forces is ultimately not as good as the power of internal self-initiation. The last hope is that all students will firmly focus on their interests, grasp their self-confidence, and thoroughly and eternally explore, impartially evaluate, with a calm mind, an open heart, sharp eyes, and agile hands, on their special subjects. Only then can they integrate and understand, and things will come naturally. True knowledge and practical learning cannot be overthrown. This kind of research spirit is the lifeblood of the university, and it is also what cultivates great thinkers, great inventors, great scientists, and great entrepreneurs.</p>
<h3>One of the Library Reading Rooms</h3>
<p>(6) Nurture a Sound Personality</p>
<p>University students are the backbone of society and are responsible for building the country. While the cultivation of the spirit of academic research is important on weekdays, the nurturing of a sound personality is even more indispensable. We carefully observe the accumulated ills of today's society and the degradation of general university students, and believe that the goals of implementing personality education today are: first, to advocate integrity and be indifferent to power and profit; second, to be responsible and abide by the law; third, to be disciplined and practice the new life; fourth, to be diligent and frugal and endure hardship; fifth, to be clear about etiquette and righteousness and be honest and self-respecting. We must enable young students to wake up in time and fiercely prescribe medicine on the work of cultivating themselves and controlling themselves, to completely wash away the bad habits of past floating, romantic, frivolous, extravagant, and luxurious, to cultivate a beautiful and pure academic style, to establish a clean and healthy life, to maintain the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, to clearly distinguish between righteousness and profit, to identify right and wrong, to hone their ambitions, and to adhere to their integrity. They must be like this in haste, and they must be like this in adversity. They will be like this from morning to night, and they will not be sloppy in the slightest. The way to advance morality and cultivate character is here, and the way to build achievements and establish a career is also here!</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "It is easy to share adversity, but difficult to share prosperity." Although the development of our university to this point cannot be said to have reached the realm of "prosperity," it has certainly entered the path of "modest prosperity." We hope that all teachers and students will always remember the ancient poem "The wind and rain are dark, the rooster crows incessantly," and encourage each other with "unceasing self-improvement," taking another step forward on a hundred-foot pole, sincerely understanding the glory of the past, hoping for the progress of the future, working hard to study and exercise, cultivating leading talents, and promoting the national spirit, in order to complete the mission of university education. This is what Yuanhuai should serve with utmost dedication, and it also depends on the efforts of all teachers and students.</p>
<h3>The Implementation of the Universal Mentor System at Great China University</h3>
<p>— Lu Jizeng</p>
<p>1. The Significance of the Mentor System</p>
<p>The purpose of the mentor system is to rationalize the relationship between teachers and students. The poor relationship between teachers and students in schools today is the cause of the decline of education in our country. If we want to save this chaotic world, we must start by creating a new educational ethic. The mentor system is a special attempt to create this new ethic.</p>
<p>The quality of the study style is the responsibility of all staff and students. Although the causes of the ups and downs of student movements are extremely complex, the abnormal state between teachers and students is a credible explanation. The fact that teachers are not like teachers and students are not like students is the main cause of student movements.</p>
<h3>One of the Chemistry Laboratories</h3>
<p>The "Teacher's Discourse" by Han Yu says: "A teacher is one who imparts the Way, imparts knowledge, and resolves doubts." Only those who can fulfill this responsibility can be called a great mentor. Because a mentor embodies the three meanings of "teacher," "beneficial friend," and "guide." In ancient times, visiting teachers and befriending them was considered essential for establishing oneself. Today's students who wish to gain a good teacher must first have sincere respect for the teacher and value the Way; those who wish to gain a beneficial friend must first have a heart of trustworthiness, righteousness, and loyalty; those who wish to seek a mentor with outstanding insight must first have the enthusiasm to immerse themselves in truth and strive for excellence. Mentors should engage in academic discussions with such students to enlighten their wisdom, temper their morality to cultivate their personality, and collaborate on planning the foundations of their careers to encourage their courage and ambition in their professions.</p>
<p>Education for the revitalization of the nation must supplement classroom instruction with character education and vocational guidance in order to fully realize the functions of the school. Now, the mentor uses their qualifications as a teacher to impart essential knowledge to students, shapes students' emotions with their identity as a beneficial friend, and cultivates students' aspirations with their position as a guide, so that students' intelligence, benevolence, and courage all reach the highest level, and their knowledge, emotions, and will are fully integrated into their actions. If students are promising talents and not willing to abandon themselves, then this kind of education will not only be comparable to Rousseau's "Emile" but will also lay the foundation for national revival. Now, I will further explain my humble opinion with a simple diagram as follows:</p>
<p>2.  The Process of Implementing the Mentorship System in Our School</p>
<p>Since the founding of our school in the 13th year of the Republic of China, it has been rich in the true spirit of the mentorship system. Teachers and students have shared weal and woe, united in their efforts in the reading movement to establish this brand-new institution. The glory of cooperation between teachers and students in our school has long been a popular story in the history of education at home and abroad. The implementation of the mentorship system in our school can be divided into the following four periods in terms of time: the first is the period of having the substance without the name, which can also be called the beginning period, that is, the three years from the autumn of the 13th year of the Republic of China to the autumn of the 16th year. During this period, the central professors were all rich in the spirit of mentorship, and the students were all rich in the ambition to accept instruction. Therefore, the whole school was not only full of the remnants of ancient academies but also had the practical effect of a school family. The second is the reform and innovation period, that is, from the autumn of the 16th year of the Republic of China to the autumn of the 21st year. In these five years, the whole body of teachers and students of our school painstakingly and with great effort, the system of mentorship, the outline is well-ordered. But we were still not confident that it was completely proper at that time, so we adopted an experimental attitude and only implemented it in the fourth-year undergraduate students and the second-year teacher training students who were about to graduate. The third is the expansion period, that is, from the autumn of the 21st year to the autumn of the 23rd year. In these two years, we took the courage gained from experience, in addition to the special graduating class students of the undergraduate and teacher training programs, we also added all the first-year undergraduate students and the freshman students of the psychology department. The number of students being mentored increased several times compared to before, and the number of mentors also increased greatly. The fourth is the universalization period. That is, from the beginning of this semester. In short, the mentorship system in our school has a history of ten years. We regard it as no less than a tree planted by our generation, which has reached the stage of containing buds and wanting to bloom. Now, I will further explain the late transformation of the mentorship system in our school with a simple diagram.</p>
<p>First Period—Gestation Period—Autumn of the 13th Year of the Republic to Autumn of the 16th Year—Experimented on undergraduate students and teacher training students about to graduate</p>
<p>Third Period—Expansion Period—Autumn of the 21st Year to Autumn of the 23rd Year—Added all freshmen of the undergraduate and teacher training programs</p>
<p>Fourth Period—Universalization Period—Starting from this semester, universalized to all students in the school</p>
<p>3.  Overview of the Implementation of the Universalized Mentorship System in This Semester</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the universalized mentorship system is an important part of our school's education for national rejuvenation, its intention was actually far back in the autumn of last year. After careful planning by the National Rejuvenation Education Committee and repeated discussions by the school's school affairs meetings, its nine articles of regulations were passed at the 160th school affairs meeting. Then, at the 161st school affairs meeting, its eleven articles of implementation details were passed. Therefore, the rules and regulations for the mentorship system determined this time were not hastily drawn up, but were carefully planned based on past experience, current needs, and future trends. The scope of its implementation is from partial to universal to all students, and the selection of mentors is based on the school's employment of professors who have a close relationship with the students' department, and the period of guidance is from the time of enrollment to the time of leaving the school, all belonging to the same mentor, and no changes may be made in the middle. A mentor meeting is held once a month to report on the progress of each person's guidance and to discuss all issues related to guidance. Currently, the school has appointed a total of thirty-three mentors, each mentoring from thirty to fifty students. Since the beginning of guidance, it has been very active. To discuss it further, today's method has many advantages over the past: First, the universalization of implementation. Students of all levels can enjoy the benefits of mentor guidance, not just limited to the highest or lowest grades, causing students in other grades to feel regret. Second, it is convenient for academic research. All designated mentors have a close relationship with the students' chosen departments; they share the same views, and those who are being guided can ask for advice and take in the essence day and night. To make attempts to reach the peak; and those who are mentors can display their strengths and do their best to guide, and the insights and accumulations they have gained from their diligent work in normal times can be passed on to others, so that academics will become more prosperous and brilliant day by day. Otherwise, if the professor who has no close relationship with the students' research is their mentor, because of different interests, students will inevitably suffer the pain of going in the opposite direction if they want to do further research. Third, it is suitable for life guidance. The mentor's guidance for students, in addition to oral instruction and written description, the most important thing is the mentor's great personality, which enlightens students and allows them to receive excellent guidance unknowingly, so that they can be included within the orbit of things. If mentors are changed frequently, and the period of guidance is very short, students cannot have a deep understanding of the mentor, how can they get excellent hints and produce satisfactory reflections! Conversely, mentors must also have long-term and clear observations of students before they can have correct and appropriate guidance, which is by no means possible with a short period of guidance. Now, our school stipulates that students should follow the same mentor from the time they enter the school to the time they leave the school, then students will spend years in school with their mentor, and their feelings will become closer day by day. Not only can the mentor have a clear observation of the student and give correct guidance, but the student can also receive the mentor's personality cultivation, like bathing in timely rain, like sitting in the spring breeze, and unconsciously being induced to become excellent talents. The greatness of its effect can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Qunyingzhai (Girls' Dormitory)</h3>
<h3>The Process of Constructing New School Buildings for Daxia Middle School</h3>
<p>— Ni Wenya</p>
<p>Our school was founded in the autumn of the 14th year of the Republic of China, only one year after the establishment of Daxia University. With the entire foundation of Daxia not yet stable, the situation of our school can be imagined. The initial classrooms were the Pan Clan Ancestral Hall on Binlang Road, and the newest dormitory was No. 201 Xiaoshadu Road. In the autumn of the second year, No. 15 Singapore Road was rented as a school building. In the spring of the 16th year, British soldiers gathered in Shanghai, and the school building was suddenly occupied; it was necessary to move back to No. 201 Xiaoshadu Road. In the autumn of the same year, it was merged into the university school building on Jiaozhou and Yuezhou Roads, so as to save expenses. In the spring of the 17th year, No. 88 Gordon Road was rented as a school meeting place; in the autumn, No. 131 Gordon Road was rented as the second academy. In the autumn of the 19th year, the university department was completed in the new school building on Zhongshan Road, so the original school building on Jiaozhou Road was completely taken over by our school for application. After the January 28th Incident in the 21st year, the university department moved back to Jiaozhou Road again; the two departments of the university and the middle school were in the same place for half a year. From the autumn of that year, our school moved into the university school building on Zhongshan Road—the original auditorium was converted into the general office of the two departments of the university and the middle school, and part of Qunxian Hall was used as classrooms for our school, and the male and female students lived separately in Qunli and Qunying dormitories. It was like this for two years.</p>
<p>Originally, the middle school attached to the university has something that ordinary middle schools cannot reach: First, there is an opportunity to use the library equipment of the university. Second, there are more opportunities to get knowledge outside of class. Third, it is easy to arouse the desire to study academic knowledge, and even students who did not work hard in school became diligent. Fourth, admission to higher education can avoid departments that do not fit one's interests and abilities, and admission to higher education is equal to promotion. Fifth, there are more personal and group contacts, and there will be more opportunities for mutual assistance and cooperation when serving the society in the future. However, only this relatively strong academic atmosphere can be used to induce and increase the desire and opportunity for middle school students to study. As for the exploration of knowledge and the method of guidance, it must be rich in the color of secondary education; and all student life must conform to the norms of middle school student life. This principle is the dividing line between the success and failure of all university-affiliated middle schools. If you can't grasp this principle, then the advantages of the university-affiliated middle school cannot be obtained, and the disadvantages that ordinary middle schools do not have are there. If you want to grasp this principle, you have to rely on the efforts of the middle school faculty; but teaching, training, and school building facilities are closely related. It is not good to have form without spirit, but it is also difficult to just hope for spirit without form. For example, in mixed canteens, dormitories, lounges, classrooms, and the same schedule, the color of middle school is difficult to encourage. In school buildings where university and middle school students are mixed, it is at least twice the effort to implement middle school student life guidance that is different from that of universities. The situation of our school's relocation of school buildings before the summer of the 21st year was like a picture of a refugee republic. Since the autumn of the 21st year, we have always hoped that the independent middle school building will be realized as soon as possible, which will be beneficial without harm.</p>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p>This year, in the spring, this ideal gradually became concrete. The drawings of the new school building were drawn by Mr. Liu Shimo, director of the civil engineering department of our school's high school, and the construction was contracted by Juechuan Construction Factory, a graduate of our school. The construction was supervised by Mr. Zhang Xingke and other two graduates of the current civil engineering department of our school's high school. Construction started in early May and was fully completed after more than four months to September. There is one office building, with the middle school director's office, the teaching office, the general office, the teacher's lounge, the reception room, and the conference room on the ground floor; a large library and a reading room on the upper floor, which can accommodate more than one hundred students. There are two classroom buildings, with sixteen ordinary classrooms, one physics and chemistry classroom, and one labor classroom, as well as one sports department and one Boy Scout headquarters. The north side of the new school building is also used as a morning exercise field and various sports fields. Male and female students still live separately in Qunli and Qunying dormitories, and are separated from the university by various means.</p>
<h3>New School Building of Daxia Middle School (One of the Classrooms)</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of our school in the 14th year, it has been exactly ten years. During these ten years, the internal and external troubles encountered by the country have caused the entire nation to feel extremely shaken psychologically and in life. Our school has uniquely received enthusiastic support from people in the society and harmonious cooperation between teachers and students in the school, so that both spiritual and material aspects have made considerable progress. I sincerely hope that all colleagues and all students will cherish the difficulty of the past and work together to realize a more glorious future!</p>

<h3>Four American Track and Field Athletes Performed in Shenyuan Yesterday, the Skills of Famous Athletes are Indeed Extraordinary</h3>
<p>Mr. Deng's Shot Put and Discus Results are Amazing</p>
<p>Others Tried Their Skills in Inverted Events</p>
<p>The first-class American track and field athletes, who set off from the United States this autumn and traveled to the east, performed in Japan. Among the sixteen people in the country, eight returned to the United States, and the remaining eight performed in Shanghai and the Philippines, and returned from the Philippines to the north. Four people, including Mutuogafu, went to Europe via Hong Kong, and four people, including Keyinhai, Crowle, and Deng, came to Shanghai from Hong Kong. They were invited by the Chinese National Sports Association to perform. The four people, including Keyinhai, arrived here on the Japanese ship Asama Maru at 10:30 yesterday morning. They landed at the Huishan Wharf. Shen Siliang and Xi Qingtuo of the Sports Association also came to the pier to welcome them. The group of seven went to Xi Qing to have lunch with Shen and others. In the afternoon at three o'clock, they drove to Shenyuan to perform. More than a thousand people who heard the news came to watch, hoping to see the champions of the world sports arena. The American School of Shanghai also planned to invite the four athletes to perform at the school this morning, but they all politely declined because of the tight schedule. They decided to take the original ship stationed in Shanghai back to the United States at 10:30 this morning. The performance yesterday is recorded as follows,</p>
<p>100 meters (1) Green (USA) 11.6 seconds, (2) Cheng Jinkuan (3) Wu Ci (Shanghai American) (4) Pei Yuan (Shanghai English)</p>
<p>200 meters Green (USA·33 seconds 2, (2) Cheng Jinkuan, (3) Wu Ci (Shanghai American) (4) Pei Yuan (Shanghai English)</p>
<p>400 meters (1) Keyinhai (USA) 53.8 seconds, (2) Hugh Tuo (Shanghai English), (3) Teng Geer (Shanghai American), (4) Fang Xijie (Shanghai English) Our country did not participate,</p>
<p>800 meters (1) Keyinhai (USA) 2 minutes 12 seconds 2, (2) Jia Daren, (3) Adams (Shanghai American),</p>
<p>3000 meters (1) Crowe (USA) 9 minutes 35 seconds, (2) Wang Zhenglin 10 minutes 8 seconds 2, (3) Jin Zhongkang,</p>
<p>Shot Put Mr. Deng (USA) 15 meters 19 (breaking the Far East's highest record of 12 meters 905), (2) Walker (Shanghai American), (3) Shen Weishen,</p>
<p>Discus (1) Mr. Deng (USA) 47 meters 83, (breaking the Far East's highest record of 42 meters 545), (2) Hawkes (Shanghai American),</p>
<p>1000 meters relay (1) American athletes, 0 minutes 2 minutes 14 seconds, (2) Mixed team,</p>
<h3>Mr. Deng's Shot Put Posture (Photo by Ye Changlie)</h3>
<p>Not Fully Exercised</p>
<p>Yesterday, the four athletes only slightly showed their skills, and they did not use their full strength in the inverted events. Except for Crowle, all those who ran were not their strengths. For example, Keyinhai is the one who set new world records in the 1,500 meters and 1 mile,</p>
<p>Yesterday he ran 400 meters and 800 meters, Green is good at 400 meters, but yesterday he ran 100 meters and 200 meters, and Keyinhai was suffering from a cold, and he came to the field sick, because he could not refuse the kindness. Crowe is the one who set a new world record in the 3,000 meters, and Mr. Deng is good at iron balls and iron cakes. Because no one competed with him, the records were not particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>Speaking from Experience</p>
<p>Among the four people, Keyinhai and Green have the best starting and running posture, relaxed and with big steps. Before the performance, according to Keyinhai, sports are also related to talent. Even in long-distance running, the world's long-distance running is always not as good as Finland. The training methods of other countries are no worse than Finland, but they cannot compare with Finland, which is also a strange thing. Japan has indeed made great progress and effort, but there is no shortage of talent. Keyinhai started training at the age of seven. When he was at the University of Kansas, he saved his brother from a fire, and his feet were severely burned by the fire. Fortunately, he was well taken care of and was able to practice again. Keyinhai showed his feet, which were full of scars, and he still did not feel completely healed. Mr. Deng also elaborated on the method of throwing a shot put, how to exert force, and how to throw it, saying that his own force is entirely in the thrust of the waist.</p>
<p>A Shoulder's Difference</p>
<p>The 100 meters was the first event. Green, the 400-meter athlete, inverted the series. After the American Lanhuo fired the gun, the Chinese athlete Cheng Jinkuan took the lead all the way, and the limelight was very strong. Green pressed hard from behind. At the last 15 meters, Green jumped forward. At the finish line, Cheng lost by a shoulder. Green's score was only 11.6 seconds. In the 200 meters, Green took the lead all the way, and Cheng Jinkuan was always behind. At the finish line, Green won by five meters, and the score was 23.2 seconds. Cheng was very depressed yesterday, I don't know why.</p>
<p>Came to the Field Sick</p>
<p>Keyinhai suffered from a cold and came to the field sick yesterday because he could not refuse the kindness. He first ran 800 meters, then 400 meters. Chinese athletes did not participate in the 400 meters. Keyinhai's score of 53.8 seconds was not his strength. In the 800 meters, China's Xu Lianren and Adams ran together. In the first 500 meters, Keyinhai always followed in the middle, seemingly to increase interest and not want to put people too far behind. In the 300 meters after 500 meters, Keyinhai began to speed up, and at the finish line, he dropped Jia Lianren by 60 meters. The score was 2 minutes 12 seconds 2. Keyinhai ran this item without taking off his trousers and coat. His steps were loose and big, and the movements of his hands were good, and his posture was beautiful.</p>
<h3>(Top) Crowle (Bottom) Green (Photo by Wang Kai)</h3>
<p>3000 Meters</p>
<p>Wang Zhenglin and Jin Zhongkang ran together. After the gun was fired, Wang followed closely behind Crowle, not letting go of a step. For the first 1,000 meters, Wang and Crowle were inseparable. Jin Zhongkang gradually fell behind and had no chance to catch up. After 1,000 meters, Crowle's pace accelerated, and Wang began to fall behind. A total of seven laps of rice. At 1,500 meters, Wang was 20 meters behind, and when he reached the finish line, Wang was 200 meters behind. Crowle's score was 9 minutes 35 seconds, which is far from the world record. Wang Zhenglin's score was 10 minutes 8 seconds 2, which also did not break the national record.</p>
<p>Amazing Distance</p>
<p>Mr. Deng performed shot put and discus, and his burly figure made people amazed. His weight should be more than 250 pounds. Compared with our country's Chen Tieniu, he is just a small wizard meeting a big wizard. His ankles are also small, so his elasticity is abundant. The shot put thrown by him is very high in the air, so the landing point is far away. His second throw was 15 meters 19. The other two people, Shen Weishen only got 9 meters 88, and Walker reached more than 10 meters. After the discus was released from Mr. Deng's hand, it flew away, and the whole field was amazed. It was 47 meters 83, exceeding the Far East record by more than five meters.</p>
<p>Mixed Relay</p>
<p>Finally, in the twilight, a 1,000-meter relay race with different distances was held. The first person ran 100 meters, the second person ran 200 meters, the third person ran 300 meters, and the fourth person ran 400 meters. The order of the American athletes was (1) Mr. Deng, (2) Keyinhai (3) Crowle (4) Green, the order of the Shanghai mixed team was (1) Wang Jihuai, (2) Gai Boman, (3) Hugh Tuo, (4) Fang Xijie, the American team won with a score of 2 minutes 14 seconds.</p>

<h3>Veterans are like Clouds Yunfei Overcomes Mackins</h3>
<p>Result 31 to 26</p>
<p>The Yunfei Basketball Team defeated Mackins 31 to 26 again in the gym of the Nautical YMCA. The veterans of the Yunfei team are like clouds, and their style is still there. When the two teams played, Mackins Fuleimen scored first. Yunfei Zhuo Guorong and Chen Xianglong both entered the door. At that time, Mackins used his height and length to fight smoothly. In the first half, Yunfei was 16 to 22 behind. However, from the second half onwards, the entire team's strategy, under the instruction of manager Zhu Yizhao, changed to short-range bottom passing and adopted individual surveillance. Yunfei was able to do whatever he wanted and soared. And made Mackins at a loss and had no room for activity. As a result, Yunfei won 31 to 26. Referee Bokeins,</p>

<h3>Shanghai Universities Jointly Implement Measures to Strictly Prohibit Students from Entering Dance Halls</h3>
<p>Cooperating with the Municipal Government to Dispatch Police Officers to Patrol Dance Halls</p>
<p>Guiding Students to Develop a Sense of Automatic Abstinence</p>
<p>Since the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Universities Joint Association resolved on the 27th to strictly prohibit students from entering dance halls, it has aroused considerable attention in academic circles and sympathy in public opinion. A reporter from the *Fu Xin* News Agency made a special visit to an executive committee member of the University Association yesterday to inquire about the implementation measures of the case. It is said that dancing is a legitimate entertainment and is regarded as a necessary skill in social circles in European and American countries. However, the purpose of dancing in our country's dance halls is quite different. It misleads young people and greatly hinders students' studies. Therefore, there was a resolution to strictly prohibit students from entering dance halls. At that time, the method of implementation was discussed. It was decided to send a letter to the Municipal Government of this city to cooperate in handling the matter. The Municipal Government will send police officers to patrol various dance halls in rotation. If students are found dancing in the hall, they will be arrested immediately. A reply has now been received from the Municipal Government agreeing to assist. As for the University Association itself, it will also work with various schools to send personnel to inspect the dance halls day and night. If students are found, their names will be recorded and reported to the school, and they will be expelled without leniency. On the other hand, students in various schools will be guided to develop a sense of automatically abstaining from entering dance halls.</p>

On the 2nd, the Ministry of Education telegraphed Guo again to urge him to stay and continue to take responsibility. A portion of the students have engaged in improper behavior and should be severely punished. If any further incidents of violating school rules occur in the future, please report the facts truthfully to allow for strict suppression.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Botanical Garden, Prepared for Many Years, Officially Opens</h3>
<p>Located at the Former Site of the Gezhi Academy on Longhua Road</p>
<p>Beautifully Positioned with Flowers, Trees, and Fruit Trees</p>
<p>In addition to the zoo established by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education on Wenmiao Road in the Nanshi area, which has already been opened, a botanical garden has also been established at the intersection of Longhua Road and Xinqiao Road. After a year of preparation, it has now been completed and officially opened on October 1st. A reporter from the *Shanghai News* made a special trip to visit yesterday. The details of the garden are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>History of Construction: The establishment of a botanical garden in Shanghai is a pioneering endeavor. In 1924, the Shanghai County Bureau of Education established a public school garden near Penglai Market, at the site of the current Shangwen Elementary School. It contained both animals and plants, exclusively for the use of students from various schools as extracurricular reference material. In 1928, it was transferred to municipal control, and the content was gradually enriched. In October of last year, the Shangwen Elementary School began constructing a new school building at the site, and the public school garden was closed. The animals were moved to the municipal zoo, and all the plants were moved to the current botanical garden.</p>
<p>Official Opening: The garden has been under preparation since last year. The garden site is the former site of the Gezhi Academy. Repairs to the buildings, construction of flower houses, and landscaping began in August of last year. The cost was over 13,000 yuan. The Municipal Bureau of Education appointed Jiang Xi-yi as the director of the garden to actively manage it, and it officially opened on October 1st. The opening hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Layout of the Garden: The garden occupies several acres. It is surrounded by fences, with an office, exhibition room, and research room in the center. The research room is equipped with plant classification, plant morphology forms, and specimen-making tools for students from various schools to use for experiments and reference. The exhibition room displays various plant specimens in picture frames, which is quite beautiful. Outside is the garden area, divided into five sections: practical crop area, industrial crop area, fruit tree area, forest area, and flower area. There is also a flower house, which cost 4,000 yuan to build. It is equipped with hot water pipes, and the surrounding area and roof are all glass, specially for growing tropical plants.</p>
<p>Welcome to Visit: The Municipal Bureau of Education issued a notice yesterday stating that the municipal botanical garden at the intersection of Longhua Road and Xinqiao Road in Nanshi has been prepared by the Bureau and will officially open on November 1st. All citizens and teachers and students of public and private schools at all levels are welcome to visit freely for research purposes. In addition to reporting to the authorities and ordering it to be distributed, this is a special notice.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders All Provincial and Municipal Departments to Forward All Middle School Textbooks to the Bureaus for Review</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education promulgated the curriculum standards, it has ordered all provincial and municipal departments to submit elementary school textbooks to the Ministry for review in accordance with the new standards and the latest departmental regulations. Currently, bookstores often only submit one volume at a time for review, failing to submit the entire set systematically. Therefore, a general order has been issued to all provincial and municipal education departments to instruct bookstores: (1) All textbooks that have already been submitted to the Ministry for review but are not complete (e.g., only the first volume has been submitted and not the second volume, or only one or two of the eight or four volumes have been submitted) must be supplemented in full when submitted for review next time. (2) All textbooks that have not been submitted for review must be submitted in full at one time in the future.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Fujian for Inspection</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent commissioners Sun Guo-feng and Inspector Dai Xia to Shanghai to inspect various colleges and universities. It is reported that Sun and Dai will complete their inspection in Shanghai within this week. The Ministry of Education plans to have these commissioners and inspectors proceed to Fujian to inspect education.</p>
<h3>Bian Zong-meng Acts as Director of the Northeast Education Relief Office</h3>
<p>The Central Government's Nanjing dispatch on the 2nd reported that Zhou Tian-fang, Director of the Northeast Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education, has requested a leave of absence from the Ministry due to illness. The Ministry has approved a six-month leave for recuperation and has appointed Bian Zong-meng to act as director. It is reported that Bian and Deputy Director Li Xi-en left for Peiping yesterday to take up their posts. The office will send four public-funded students to study abroad in the Northeast during the summer vacation next year.</p>
<h3>Datong University Celebrates Tenth Anniversary This Morning</h3>
<p>Practicing the Spirit of Hard Work in Management, Teaching, and Learning</p>
<p>In the Future, Taking National Rejuvenation Education as the Overall Goal</p>
<p>Datong University has been established since the autumn of 1924, and it has now been ten years. The main goal of the university's establishment is a reading movement. All teachers and students cooperate and are extremely rich in the spirit of sacrifice, struggle, and creation. Its three tenets of hard work—hard work in management by staff, hard work in teaching by professors, and hard work in learning by students—have remained unchanged for ten years. The tenth anniversary celebration will be held at 9:00 a.m. today. A summary of the situation is provided below:</p>
<p>Historical Development</p>
<p>The university's campus has changed several times. At first, only a preparatory office was set up in a rented house in Meirenli, Bei Di-E Road, French Concession. Then, it moved to Yichang Road at the end of Gordon Road. Then, it moved to 201 Xiaoshadu Road. Then, it moved to 301 Jiaozhou Road. In the autumn of 1930, it finally moved to its magnificent new campus built on Zhongshan Road, Fanwangdu, thus laying a permanent foundation for a century of educating people. The university has long been approved for registration by the Ministry of Education and is listed among the famous universities in the country.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Current Situation</p>
<p>Now, the university's campus is magnificent and beautiful, all designed in the latest style. It includes a large classroom, Qunxian Hall, a boys' dormitory, Qunce Zhai, a boys' dormitory, Qunli Zhai, a girls' dormitory, Qunying Zhai, a science hall, a library, a grand auditorium, a sanatorium, three new Datong Middle School campus buildings, twelve teachers' and staff dormitories, city rooms, dining halls, bungalows, and all necessary ancillary buildings. Overlooking the entire campus, there are ancient trees, open fields, clear streams, ponds, spacious playgrounds, fresh air, and a pure environment. The layout of the Sun Yat-sen design is rich in natural scenery. The equipment in the library and science facilities is quite complete, and the establishment of the Education Hall and the Public Education Experimental Area is particularly distinctive. In total, the university currently has 1,300 university students and 600 middle school students, moving forward steadily.</p>
<p>Future Direction</p>
<p>In the future, the university's administrative policy has been decided last winter to take national rejuvenation education as the overall goal. Its efforts are directed in about four areas: (1) Strictly implement personality education to cultivate sound national morality; (2) Promote production education to save the endangered national economy; (3) Reward science education to develop the infinite natural treasures; (4) Implement national defense education to cultivate the nation's self-defense capabilities. At this time of serious national crisis, who will maintain the order? The university's spirit of struggle, sacrifice, and creation may well be the pearl for our nation to save itself and survive in the future.</p>
<p>Anniversary Ceremony</p>
<p>The tenth anniversary celebration will be held at 9:00 a.m. this morning. The mayor of the city, heads of education institutions, and presidents of various universities, including Liu Zhan-en, Li Zhao-huan, and Xiao You-mei, as well as university directors such as Du Yue-sheng, Zhang Zhu-ping, and Jiang Wen-yu, will all participate in the anniversary ceremony. At 12:00 noon, the directors, teachers, staff, and graduates will have a banquet. At 2:00 p.m., the inauguration ceremony of the new Datong Middle School campus will be held. From 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., the university's graduates will hold a reunion on campus. At 6:00 p.m., there will be a lantern parade. At 8:00 p.m., spectacular fireworks will be set off. It is reported that stores on nearby Zhongshan Road will hang flags and lights in celebration. Details have been published by the university's Datong University Journal and Datong Weekly in a special tenth-anniversary issue, as well as various special publications with exquisite illustrations, which will be distributed to guests at the meeting.</p>
<h3>Registration for Unemployed High School and University Graduates Ends at Noon Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, under orders, has been conducting unemployment registration for high school and university graduates in this city. Since the registration office was established at the Chinese Vocational Education Society on the 29th of last month, more than 500 people have registered. Registration will close at 12:00 noon today.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Education Academic Lecture Postponed</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The third academic lecture hosted by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education was originally scheduled to be given by Central Committee member Chen Li-fu at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 p.m. on the 4th of this month, as reported in previous newspapers. It has now been learned that Mr. Chen is unable to come to Shanghai due to circumstances and has been rescheduled to 2:00 p.m. on the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Issue Third Quarter Subsidies to Private Schools</h3>
<p>The Educational Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently discussed the Health Department's report on schools receiving subsidies. According to the report, the subsidized schools (all Chinese schools) have been graded according to the Health Department's standards. Several schools that were considered unsatisfactory in June of last year have largely complied with the designated standards for reform, but twelve schools have not yet done so. After review by the committee, subsidies for the third quarter of this year can be issued immediately to all schools except the twelve mentioned above and one school that has moved outside the boundary. This proposal has now been approved by the Board of Directors. In addition, the list of committee members for the review of subsidy applications for 1935 has been finalized as follows: The Chinese Schools Subcommittee includes Mr. Yuan Lü-deng, Lin Kang-hou, Dr. Ou Yuan-huai, Dr. Wei Peng-dan, Dr. Liu Zhan-en, Dr. Liao Shi-cheng, Mr. Ge Zu-lan, Dr. Cao Yun-xiang, Mrs. Xia Jin-lin, and Ms. Yang Xi-zhen. The Foreign Schools Subcommittee includes Mr. She-bao-de, Mrs. Leslie, and Mr. Yamamoto.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Considers Japanese Residents' Proposal to Reform Education Policy</h3>
<p>A Japanese residents' organization in this city has suggested to the Municipal Council to change its education policy. The main points are: (1) Abolish municipal schools; (2) Subsidize schools run by various expatriate organizations; (3) The total annual subsidy should be based on the total amount of recurrent and temporary education expenses for this year; (4) The allocation standard should be determined based on the number of students or the amount of taxes paid. This proposal was submitted to the Education Committee for discussion, and Japanese representatives Mr. Sugimoto and Mr. Ikeda were invited to the meeting to present their views.</p>
<p>According to a report submitted by the acting head of the Finance Department, in 1933, there were 6,591 expatriate students in municipal and municipal-funded schools, about half of whom were Japanese. If half of this year's recurrent and temporary expenses for foreign schools were used to subsidize Japanese schools according to the proposal, the deficit would exceed 700,000 yuan. However, the actual subsidy is only 118,000 yuan. The amount of self-funding by the Japanese side is about 327,000 yuan. Tuition is clearly minimal, with a maximum of only five yuan per month. Later, Mr. Ikeda stated that the Japanese residents' proposal was intended to seek a fair distribution of funds, but complete adoption seemed to be very difficult. Therefore, reasonable revisions would not be opposed. However, the current system of the Municipal Council would require more donations to expand further. In any case, the increase in funding would not allow all students within the boundary to receive education. Therefore, how can the increase in funding be continued without reaching a limit? Why not allocate more of the funds so that students outside the municipal schools can benefit? The current establishment of municipal schools is quite beneficial to wealthy families, while nine-tenths of the others are unable to attend due to high tuition fees. As for changing the policy, it can be done gradually. First, the current construction costs could be transferred to subsidies.</p>
<p>One committee member said that there are several standards for the distribution of funds. In terms of population, there are 18,478 Japanese (5,438 under the age of 15) and 17,993 other foreigners (3,493 under the age of 15) within and outside the boundaries. There are 971,397 Chinese (253,388 under the age of 15). In terms of the amount of taxes paid, the Japanese account for 7.5%, other foreigners 50.4%, and Chinese 42.1%. Which standard should be adopted must be investigated.</p>
<p>Mr. Ikeda replied that whether the distribution should be strictly and equally determined according to residents and nationality could be considered by the Municipal Council. However, the current budget for education expenses seems to have reached its highest level. Even if the Municipal Council's revenue increases, it can only subsidize private schools with its surplus. In terms of student treatment, each Japanese student costs about 60 or 70 yuan per year, while other foreign students cost up to 400 yuan per student per year, which is a big difference.</p>
<p>The chairman of the committee stated that the tuition fees paid by students in municipal schools are based on one-third of the total expenses of the school. Mr. Ikeda said that the Japanese schools have different methods. In addition to subsidies from the Japanese government and the Municipal Council, everything is borne by Japanese organizations. As for the tuition fees, they are investigated based on the ability of the parents and assigned accordingly. It is now estimated that the expenditure for 1935 will be 587,000 yuan, while the income is only 539,000 yuan.</p>
<p>After further discussion, it was clarified that the Municipal Council's responsibility is only to plan education for the children of residents or taxpayers within the boundary. If there are students from the French Concession or the Chinese area in municipal schools, one-quarter of the tuition fee will be added. However, it is not easy to restrict subsidies, as subsidized schools will inevitably admit children from outside the boundary or who are not taxpayers.</p>
<p>One committee member said that the Municipal Council's education expenses have doubled in the past three years and now account for 89% of the total revenue. However, another committee member said that the education plan adopted four years ago was the minimum and not the maximum. The need to increase the number of schools now is as urgent as it was in the past. Although the plan has been slightly halted, the public hopes that it will resume next year. At this point, the committee announced that the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Autumn Special Issue</p>
<h3>The Reclusive Scholar, the Chrysanthemum</h3>
<p>— Only Through</p>
<p>To be a follower, clinging to the powerful, rushing towards all the excitement—everyone says that this is not the type of person you want to be. Therefore, in the seasons of spring and summer, when all the flowers are blooming and fawning, it is difficult to find famous flowers with noble character. Even if there are any, they are mixed in with all the purples and reds, and in the eyes of the general flower appreciator, they just seem like one of the three thousand hangers-on. Therefore, in the autumn wind, when all the purples and reds have faded and lost their luster, the chrysanthemum, which blooms, is called a "reclusive scholar".</p>
<p>The reason why the chrysanthemum is called a "reclusive scholar" is not only because it doesn't cling to the powerful, it isn't running to fawn on others, it doesn't squeeze into the three thousand hangers-on, and it doesn't blossom and fade with the masses. Even in terms of appearance, it has unique characteristics. The stems and leaves of ordinary flowers all have a common characteristic, which is that they are very plump. If there is not enough fertilizer to make them plump, then they cannot release beautiful flowers. The chrysanthemum is not like this. Even without fertilizer, it can bloom. With fertilizer, there are still only a few sparse stems. Moreover, potted plants are not as elegant as those that grow by the eastern fence. This is the nature of "accustomed to being a mountain man, free and easy".</p>
<p>Ordinary flowers, except for woody plants, rely on deeply rooted trunks and branches, and can still sprout and bloom next spring. The rest, after the autumn wind sweeps through, after the summer heat recedes, all wither into dead grass. The chrysanthemum is not like this. Although the chrysanthemum is an herbaceous plant, after it has bloomed, it still survives, waiting for next autumn to sprout and bloom again, with clear, noble, elegant, and light flowers, to embellish this extremely bleak autumn scene. Moreover, although chrysanthemums bloom, they do not leave seeds, but are propagated by division of branches, unlike ordinary flowers, which strive for expansion of power. One flower can contain dozens or even hundreds of seeds.</p>
<p>However, in this era of rampant human desires, the reclusive scholar, who does not fawn, does not cling to power, is content with indifference, and does not compete with the world, is no longer valued. Because today's so-called reclusive scholars are, in name, living in the mountains, cultivating their nature, watching waterfalls, and listening to autumn winds. In reality, they are unable to forget the pleasures of music, women, horses, and dogs. They are merely temporarily frustrated, and they call themselves reclusive scholars, waiting for the opportunity to come. Or, because their wallets are overflowing with official wealth, they retire to the mountains and forests, with a charming wife on the left and a beautiful concubine on the right, just to change the air. The chrysanthemum is called a reclusive scholar, and these people are also called reclusive scholars. I think the chrysanthemum cannot bear this mass of wealth and luxury.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Republic of China Criminal Code Amendment Passed by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>I. The chapter count and titles in the General Provisions section of the current law that have been added, deleted, revised, or merged in this bill are as follows:</p>
<p>(I) In the Chapter on Legal Examples, all articles related to relatives have been deleted because provisions already exist in the Family Law of the Civil Code. The remaining articles are few, so this bill merges them into one article attached to the Chapter on Legal Precedents, thus deleting the former chapter.</p>
<p>(II) Within the Chapter on Temporal Examples, provisions already exist in the Civil Code, such as those regarding the calculation of time periods. Others are already covered in prison regulations, such as the timeframes for releasing prisoners on parole. These have been deleted, leaving only one article concerning the calculation of criminal sentences. This bill merges that article into the Chapter on Penalties, thus deleting the former chapter.</p>
<p>(III) Most articles in the Chapter on Criminal Responsibility and Mitigation of Penalties concern issues of criminal responsibility. Only the article on self-reporting specifically concerns penalty mitigation. Therefore, this bill moves that article into the Chapter on the Discretionary Imposition and Aggravation/Mitigation of Penalties, and the chapter title is simplified to Criminal Responsibility.</p>
<p>(IV) "Attempt" refers to an incomplete crime; there is no so-called "attempted crime." Therefore, this bill changes the Chapter on Attempted Crimes to Chapter on Attempted Offenses.</p>
<p>(V) The articles in the Chapter on Penalties cover not only types of penalties but also their severity, execution, pronouncement, and credit for detention. Therefore, this bill shortens the title to "Penalties."</p>
<p>(VI) Most articles in the current law's Chapter on Combined Offenses concern issues of multiple offenses being punished together. Therefore, this bill changes the title to Multiple Offenses Punished Together.</p>
<p>(VII) This bill merges the Chapter on Discretionary Penalties and the Chapter on Examples of Aggravation/Mitigation into one chapter to simplify matters.</p>
<p>(VIII) Recent criminal policy emphasizes social defense. Newly revised criminal codes in various countries include detailed provisions on security measures. While the current law includes provisions for juvenile offenders and mentally ill individuals, such as moral reformation, education, behavior supervision, and imprisonment, the scope is too narrow. This bill specifically adds a Chapter on Security Measures.</p>
<p>II. The current law's Article 2 does not have provisions for intermediary laws and uses only the severity of old and new laws as the standard for comparison, which seems inadequate. Therefore, this bill adds provisions for intermediary laws. Except for custodial measures, which should absolutely follow the new law, if the law before the judgment is more favorable to the perpetrator, then the provisions most favorable to the perpetrator in the law at the time of the act or in the intermediary law should be used for the verdict. Furthermore, if the law changes after the verdict has been finalized and no longer punishes the act, there seems to be no need to continue executing the sentence. Therefore, this bill adds this provision as well.</p>
<p>III. Criminal acts committed on Chinese aircraft flying outside of the country's territory should also be subject to Chinese criminal law. Therefore, this bill adds this provision.</p>
<p>IV. Enslaving people is an internationally prohibited act. Furthermore, public officials who commit embezzlement in a foreign country while on duty should also be punished according to Chinese criminal law. Therefore, this bill adds these provisions separately.</p>
<p>V. According to the current law's Article 7, the Republic of China Criminal Code applies too broadly to citizens of the Republic of China and to people outside of the territory of the Republic of China or foreign citizens who commit crimes against citizens of the Republic of China outside of the territory of the Republic of China, for which the minimum sentence is imprisonment. This bill revises this to only apply to crimes for which the minimum sentence is imprisonment of three years or more.</p>
<p>VI. The current law does not have explicit provisions regarding the causal relationship between passive acts and criminal facts, which causes difficulties in application. Therefore, this bill adds these provisions.</p>
<p>VII. The current law refers to all aggravations or mitigations of penalties as "original sentence." In reality, when there is progressive aggravation or mitigation, or when aggravation and mitigation occur in succession, what is being aggravated or mitigated is the aggravated or mitigated sentence, not the original sentence. Therefore, this bill changes the wording to "the sentence."</p>
<p>VIII. According to current law, ignorance of the law can only result in a reduction of the sentence based on the circumstances, which seems too harsh. This bill changes "ignorance of the law" to "ignorance of the law" and allows for exemption from punishment under certain conditions.</p>
<p>IX. The focus should be on moral reformation and education for juvenile offenders. Therefore, this bill raises the age of responsibility to fourteen and the age for reduced punishment to eighteen. At the same time, it specifies the provisions for moral reformation, education, behavior supervision, and other measures in detail within the Chapter on Security Measures to provide for redress.</p>
<p>X. The current law adopts a mandatory reduction of punishment for people with mental deficiencies and those who are deaf or mute, which seems too lenient. This bill changes it to an option for reduction.</p>
<p>XI. Committing a crime while intoxicated is naturally punishable by law, and there is no need for special provisions. Therefore, this bill deletes Article 32 of the current law.</p>
<p>XII. The current law punishes lower-level public officials for official actions taken under the orders of their superiors, regardless of whether they knew the orders were illegal, which seems too harsh. Therefore, this bill adds an exception clause.</p>
<p>XIII. The current law adopts a discretionary reduction or exemption for impossible attempts and limits it to cases where the methods of the crime could never produce the intended result. This bill changes it to where reduction or exemption must be granted for cases where there is no danger, regardless of whether the method or the objective is impossible, which seems more appropriate.</p>
<p>XIV. Instigating a crime is a particularly malicious act that should be punished independently. However, punishing the instigator with the full sentence of the completed crime when the instigated person did not commit the crime or committed it but failed seems excessive. Therefore, this bill stipulates that such situations should be treated as attempted crimes.</p>
<p>XV. This bill stipulates that accomplices are always eligible for a reduced sentence, allowing judges to exercise discretion based on the circumstances to achieve fairness.</p>
<p>XVI. The current law does not specify the maximum period for aggravated detention, which seems inadequate. This bill stipulates a limit of four months to differentiate it from imprisonment.</p>
<p>XVII. The standards for the severity of principal penalties have issues that cannot be resolved by Article 51 of the current law, such as issues of exclusive penalties, elective penalties, and concurrent penalties. Therefore, this bill makes appropriate revisions.</p>
<p>XVIII. This bill changes the provisions of the current law regarding deprivation of public rights to only include the loss of qualifications as a public official. The loss of other qualifications should be specified in various related laws for greater convenience. Furthermore, this bill clearly specifies the conditions for declaring or being able to declare the loss of qualifications as a public official in the General Provisions, and it deletes all articles related to the deprivation of public rights in the Special Provisions to achieve simplicity.</p>
<p>XIX. The Temporary New Criminal Law's provisions regarding the conversion of short-term imprisonment to fines were not adopted by the current law. As a result, people sentenced to short-term imprisonment must be sent to prison regardless of any impediments, which is quite inconvenient in practice. Moreover, it is difficult to avoid those who commit crimes accidentally acquiring bad habits due to short-term imprisonment. Many in the legal community have advocated for restoring this system. Therefore, this bill allows the conversion to fines under strict conditions.</p>
<p>XX. The current law sets the payment period for fines at one month, which seems too short. This bill changes it to two months. The current law allows for imprisonment in lieu of fines for up to one year, which can be confused with short-term imprisonment. This bill changes it to only allowing labor in lieu of fines and sets the limit at six months. Furthermore, the current law stipulates that labor in lieu of fines can be allowed with the consent of the individual, which is contrary to the purpose of property penalties. Therefore, this bill changes it to where labor in lieu of fines is not allowed unless the individual is unable to pay after compulsory enforcement.</p>
<p>XXI. If the criminal motive of a person sentenced to detention or a fine is clearly excusable for reasons of public interest or morality, there seems to be no need to execute the sentence. Therefore, this bill adds a provision allowing for a reprimand instead.</p>
<p>XXII. The current law stipulates that each two days of detention can be credited as one day of imprisonment, implying that the conditions in detention centers are superior to those in prisons. However, on-site inspections show that the facilities in detention centers are often inferior to those in prisons. As a result, those awaiting trial suffer even more than those who have been convicted. Therefore, this bill adopts a mandatory credit system and credits one day for one day.</p>
<p>XXIII. Issues such as how the effects of converting to fines, labor, or education relate to recidivism and probation are closely related. Therefore, this bill adds these provisions.</p>
<p>XXIV. The current law's articles on the execution of penalties in the Chapter on Penalties should be placed in the Criminal Procedure Law or the Prison Law. Therefore, this bill deletes them entirely.</p>
<p>XXV. The maliciousness of a recidivist is not necessarily directly proportional to the similarity or type of crime and the number of offenses. Therefore, this bill provides a general provision for aggravating the sentence for recidivists up to one-half, allowing judges to use discretion based on the circumstances.</p>
<p>XXVI. The circumstances of continuous offenses are sometimes extremely serious. Therefore, this bill specifically adds a provision for aggravating the sentence in such cases.</p>
<p>XXVII. The current law's provisions regarding fines focus on assessing the offender's financial resources and do not consider the benefits gained from the crime. As a result, the amount of the fine is often less than the benefits gained. Therefore, this bill grants judges the authority to increase the fine within the range of the benefits gained.</p>
<p>XXVIII. The crimes listed in Article 60 of this bill are all subject to simplified procedures under the Criminal Procedure Law. While prosecutors can make a decision not to prosecute, if the victim directly files a private prosecution with the court and the court finds the circumstances to be minor and clearly deserving of leniency, reducing the sentence seems insufficient. Therefore, this bill grants the court the power to exempt the sentence to maintain balance.</p>
<p>XXIX. The current law uniformly stipulates that self-reporting a crime results in a one-third reduction of the sentence, which is insufficient as an incentive. Therefore, this bill provides for general mitigation in the General Provisions and adds provisions for mitigating or exempting the sentence in the Special Provisions.</p>
<p>XXX. This bill stipulates that people under the age of 18 or over the age of 80 cannot be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. This is because those who are young can still be reformed, and those who are old should be treated with leniency. It is not appropriate to impose extreme penalties on either group.</p>
<p>XXXI. The current law sets two levels of mitigation: one-half and one-third. For cases where no specific fraction is provided, the mitigation is at least one-half, which is unfairly lenient. Furthermore, there are provisions for mitigating death and life sentences by fractions, which is theoretically flawed. Therefore, this bill clearly specifies the penalty ranges for mitigating death and life sentences and sets a general rule of reducing the sentence to one-half for mitigating imprisonment, detention, or fines. However, if there are provisions for exempting the sentence, the reduction can be up to one-third. It also clearly establishes applicable provisions for discretionary mitigation.</p>
<p>XXXII. The current law limits the conditions for probation to whether the offender has previously been sentenced. It does not include provisions for supervising those on probation, which seems inappropriate. Therefore, this bill changes it to where probation cannot be granted unless the judge believes that temporarily suspending the execution of the sentence is appropriate. It also stipulates that those sentenced to probation may be subject to protective supervision during the probation period.</p>
<p>XXXIII. Since the condition for parole is limited to having genuine evidence of remorse, the period of imprisonment need not be too long. Therefore, this bill changes the current law's "less than two years" to "less than one year."</p>
<p>XXXIV. The current law divides the statute of limitations for prosecution and execution of sentences into three types: 20 years, 10 years, and 3 years. This bill changes it to five types: 20 years, 10 years, 5 years, 3 years, and 1 year, which is more fair.</p>
<p>XXXV. The current law calculates the statute of limitations for prosecution from the date of the final act of the crime, which cannot include crimes that are in a continuous state except for continuous offenses. This bill specifically corrects this.</p>
<p>XXXVI. According to the current law, if the reason for suspending the statute of limitations has not disappeared, the statute of limitations will never be completed. Therefore, this bill specifically stipulates that the reason is deemed to have disappeared after a certain period.</p>
<p>XXXVII. The chapter count and titles in the Special Provisions section of the current law that have been added or revised in this bill are as follows:</p>
<p>(I) The articles in the Chapter on Offenses Against Elections only punish obstruction of elections, which is a somewhat narrow scope. This bill changes the chapter title to Chapter on Offenses Against Voting so that it can also apply to voting on initiatives, referendums, and recalls.</p>
<p>(II) The current law places counterfeiting of government bonds, company stocks, postage stamps, revenue stamps, and all other securities within the Chapter on Forgery of Documents and Seals, which seems inappropriate. This bill removes the articles on securities and creates a separate chapter.</p>
<p>(III) Profiteering and usury are extremely reprehensible. Therefore, this bill specifically adds punitive provisions to the Chapter on Fraud and Breach of Trust and changes the chapter title to Fraud, Breach of Trust, and Usury.</p>
<p>XXXVIII. If public officials who are derelict in their duties are not severely punished, there will never be clean governance. Therefore, in addition to appropriately increasing the number of articles on crimes committed by public officials, the punishment for public officials is uniformly increased.</p>
<p>XXXIX. Since the articles on relatives in the General Provisions section of the current law have been deleted, this bill clearly defines the scope of the articles on relatives in the Special Provisions section according to the circumstances to facilitate application.</p>
<p>XL. The current law aggravates the penalties for false accusations, violations of graves, corpses, abandonment, assault, and unlawful detention committed against lineal or collateral ascendants. This bill believes that the general penalties for the above crimes are already not light. If the circumstances of crimes against ascendants are serious, the maximum penalty of the original sentence can be imposed. There is no need to further aggravate the penalty. Therefore, only the articles on assault of lineal ascendants and violations of their graves and corpses are retained, and the rest are deleted.</p>
<p>XLI. The current law treats one's own property as another's property when it has been sealed or burdened by real rights, leased, or insured, in cases involving crimes of public danger and crimes of theft, robbery, extortion, embezzlement, fraud, breach of trust, and destruction of property. This bill believes that the Chapter on Public Danger already has punitive provisions for burning or flooding one's own property, and the Chapter on Obstructing Official Duties already has explicit punitive provisions for damaging or removing seals or markings affixed by public officials or acts that violate their validity. As for other situations, compensation for damages can be sought through civil law to provide redress. Therefore, Articles 209, 339, 359, and 385 of the current law are deleted.</p>
<p>XLII. Articles on causing death or serious injury in the current law mostly increase the penalties based on intentional injury, which involves repeated citations and is quite difficult to use. Therefore, this bill uniformly specifies the penalty ranges.</p>
<p>XLIII. Preparing to commit murder, robbery, or kidnapping for ransom is extremely dangerous. The current law does not punish such preparations, which seems inadequate. This bill adds punitive provisions.</p>
<p>XLIV. The current law limits the punishment for conspiracy to cases of murder, robbery, and kidnapping for ransom, which is too narrow. Furthermore, if there are instigating circumstances in a conspiracy, the provisions regarding instigation in the General Provisions can be applied. If there is only participation in the conspiracy, verbal assistance is a form of aiding, and the provisions regarding accomplices in the General Provisions can be applied. Therefore, this bill deletes Articles 288, 351, and 373 of the current law, which concern conspiracy.</p>
<p>XLV. Insurrection poses a minimal danger in its preparatory or conspiratorial stage. Punishments for those who turn themselves in can be relaxed. Therefore, this bill adds provisions for exemption from punishment.</p>
<p>XLVI. Article 105 of the current law, which stipulates aiding insurrection, is essentially about accomplices to insurrection, and provisions regarding accomplices in the General Provisions can be applied. Therefore, it is deleted.</p>
<p>XLVII. The current law only punishes those who violate government authorization when entering into treaties with foreign countries that harm sovereignty. This bill believes that those who have not received government authorization but privately enter into agreements with foreign governments or their representatives on matters that should be approved by the government should also be severely punished. Therefore, this bill adds this provision.</p>
<p>XLVIII. The offense in Article 112 of the current law is already included in Article 98 of this bill. Therefore, it is deleted.</p>
<p>XLIX. The penalties for ordinary intentional homicide, intentional injury, and unlawful detention are already quite severe. There is no need to further aggravate the penalties for committing the above crimes against heads of state of friendly nations. There is even less need to punish preparatory acts. As for crimes against foreign representatives, each has its own special article that can be applied based on its nature, and there is no need to apply the provisions of the articles on obstructing official duties. Therefore, this bill deletes Articles 121, 122, and 123 of the current law in the Chapter on Offenses Against National Relations. However, the ordinary punishment for publicly insulting heads of state of friendly nations and foreign representatives seems too light. Therefore, this bill adds an article specifying a more severe penalty.</p>
<p>L. Civilians privately colluding with the enemy in wartime are rare. As for soldiers, the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Code can be applied. Therefore, Article 124 of the current law is deleted.</p>
<p>LI. Public officials who do not fulfill their duties and abandon their posts are guilty of heinous crimes. Therefore, this bill adds provisions for severe punishment.</p>
<p>LII. Bribery cases are often difficult to detect because the giver and receiver are equally guilty. Therefore, this bill deletes the offense of bribing public officials for actions within their duties. As for bribing public officials for actions that violate their duties, in addition to reducing the sentence, provisions are made for reducing or exempting the sentence for self-reporting and reducing the sentence for confessing to facilitate the detection of bribery cases.</p>
<p>LIII. Article 130 of the current law stipulates the special offense of bribery by public officials or arbiters with judicial duties. This bill increases the penalty for general bribery offenses. The public officials who are arbiters have now been changed to arbitrators and are specified in the relevant articles. Therefore, this article is deleted.</p>
<p>LIV. Article 133 of the current law only punishes public officials with the duty to prosecute crimes, which is somewhat narrow. Therefore, this bill adds public officials with the duty to punish crimes. Furthermore, abusing authority to arrest or detain is an extremely serious act that must be punished. Therefore, this bill adds provisions for this as well.</p>
<p>LV. Public officials who have custody, escort, or confinement of criminals who torture convicted or unconvicted criminal defendants or suspects are acting illegally. Therefore, this bill adds punitive provisions.</p>
<p>LVI. Public officials who accept civil or criminal lawsuits beyond their authority greatly impede the rule of law. Therefore, this bill adds punitive provisions.</p>
<p>LVII. Public officials who neglect their duties and cause disasters are unforgivable. Therefore, this bill adds punitive provisions.</p>
<p>LVIII. The current law does not have provisions for confiscating and recovering the value of direct or indirect gains for public officials who commit crimes of profiteering. This bill adds these provisions.</p>
<p>LIX. Article 137 of the current law punishes public officials who leak or deliver secrets and includes documents, drawings, information, and items related to domestic affairs of the Republic of China and documents, drawings, information, and items that should be kept secret other than for national defense. Furthermore, this bill believes that public officials who negligently leak or deliver secret documents, etc., other than for national defense, and non-public officials who leak or deliver secret documents, etc., other than for national defense, that they learned or possessed due to their duties or business should also be punished. Therefore, this bill adds these provisions.</p>
<p>LX. Examinations are a crucial matter for the state. If there is fraud that leads to inaccurate results, punishment should be imposed. Therefore, this bill adds these provisions.</p>
<p>LXI. Preventing crimes is the responsibility of the national police. Requiring the people to bear this responsibility is too harsh. Therefore, this bill deletes Articles 162 and 168 of the current law.</p>
<p>LXII. Instigating or soliciting lawsuits and profiting from them are reprehensible. Therefore, this bill adds punitive provisions.</p>
<p>LXIII. The current law only punishes perjury during court proceedings. It is impossible to prevent false statements during investigations. Therefore, this bill adds statements made during investigations, but only those made during investigations by prosecutors.</p>
<p>LXIV. Exposing corpses with infectious pathogens or spreading pathogens by other means can easily cause epidemics that greatly affect the lives and health of the people. Article 206 of the current law does not have provisions for this. Therefore, this bill adds this provision.</p>
<p>LXV. Most attempts to commit offenses related to the falsification of weights and measures are minor, and Article 221 of the current law is especially harsh in punishing possession based on the social conditions of our country. Therefore, they are all deleted. As for those who use weights and measures that violate the prescribed standards, the majority are those who are engaged in business. Therefore, this bill adds explicit provisions for more severe punishment.</p>
<p>LXVI. Article 232 of the current law limits the scope to doctors' certificates for those engaged in business who record untrue matters in documents created in the course of their business. Therefore, this bill expands the scope to all those engaged in business and all documents created in the course of their business to avoid omissions.</p>
<p>LXVII. The current law stipulates that all acts of sexual intercourse with girls under the age of 16 are treated as rape, which seems too strict considering the average development of girls and their ability to express consent. Therefore, this bill changes it to where sexual intercourse with girls under the age of 14 is treated as rape. Sexual intercourse with girls over the age of 14 but under the age of 16 is punished with a lighter sentence. The same provisions apply to indecent acts with boys or girls over the age of 14 but under the age of 16.</p>
<p>LXVIII. Article 256 of the current law only punishes married women who commit adultery, and does not punish married men who commit adultery, which is contrary to the principle of gender equality. Therefore, this bill punishes all those who commit adultery while married. At the same time, it stipulates that no accusation can be made unless there has been prior negotiation or a divorce judgment to maintain the peace of the family.</p>
<p>LXIX. The current law imposes the same punishment for enticing and abducting, which seems to be an imbalance of severity. Furthermore, it only limits it to those who have left the care of people with parental authority, guardians, or conservators, which is too narrow. This bill punishes abduction more severely than enticement and expands the scope to those who have left the care of all those with supervisory authority, which is more appropriate.</p>
<p>LXX. Enticing married women disrupts family organization. The current law does not have explicit punitive provisions, and many in the legal community have advocated for such provisions. Therefore, this bill adds this provision.</p>
<p>LXXI. Enticing boys and girls under the age of 16 is especially heinous. Therefore, this bill stipulates that it should be treated as abduction.</p>
<p>LXXII. Returning the enticed person or pointing out the location of the enticed person before the judgment is announced greatly benefits the victim. There is a need to reward this. Therefore, this bill adds provisions for reducing the sentence.</p>
<p>LXXIII. Obstructing the agricultural irrigation of others with the intention of harming them not only infringes on individual legal rights but also affects the rural economy. Therefore, this bill adds punitive provisions.</p>
<p>LXXIV. Falsely marking the country of origin or quality of goods deceives and damages commercial credit. Therefore, this bill adds explicit punitive provisions.</p>
<p>LXXV. The current law imposes the same punishment for manufacturing and selling opium, morphine, cocaine, heroin, and other narcotics. This bill believes that the harm to society from manufacturing and selling morphine, cocaine, heroin, and other narcotics is greater than that from manufacturing and selling opium. Therefore, it imposes separate punishments.</p>
<p>LXXVI. The current law specifies the penalties for those who premeditate murder, kill with cruel acts, and kill to facilitate or evade other crimes. This bill believes that ordinary murder can be punished with the death penalty. If the means of the crime and other circumstances are extremely heinous, the judge can consider everything and impose the death penalty. There is no need for separate provisions. Therefore, this bill deletes Articles 284 and 285 of the current law.</p>
<p>LXXVII. The current law only reduces the punishment of mothers who kill their children if the children are illegitimate, relative to ordinary murder. This bill believes that the nature of maternal love is inherently strong. Mothers will only kill their children if it is a matter of reputation, economic pressure, or other inevitable circumstances. Therefore, this bill stipulates that it is not limited to illegitimate children.</p>
<p>LXXVIII. Public health is related to the strength of the race. All those who transmit venereal disease to others, abuse young children, bind the feet of others, or otherwise impede the natural development of children's bodies should be punished. Therefore, this bill clearly specifies this.</p>
<p>LXXIX. The current law only punishes those who enslave people. However, there are often situations where people are not slaves in name but whose lack of freedom is similar to that of slaves, such as young children who perform in traveling shows and prostitutes raised by madams. All those who place people in such positions must be punished. Therefore, this bill adds this provision.</p>
<p>LXXX. Article 315 of the current law stipulates the offense of obstructing the freedom of women. This offense is less serious than Article 257, which obstructs both freedom and supervisory rights, yet the punishment is heavier, which seems inappropriate. Therefore, this bill revises this.</p>
<p>LXXXI. The current law does not have explicit punitive provisions for squatting on real property. This bill specifically adds an item to the Chapter on Theft so that the punishment for theft can be applied.</p>
<p>LXXXII. Committing kidnapping for ransom while also committing robbery or piracy is extremely serious and should be punished with extreme penalties. Therefore, this bill adds this provision.</p>

<p>Article 9 The same act may still be punished under this law, even if a final judgment has been rendered in a foreign country. However, if the whole or part of the sentence has been executed in a foreign country, the execution of the whole or part of the sentence may be waived.</p>

<p>Article 12 An act is not punishable if it is not the result of intent or negligence. Punishment for negligent acts is limited to cases where there is a specific provision.</p>
<p>Article 13 An actor who knows the facts constituting a crime and intends for it to occur is deemed to have intent.</p>
<p>An actor who foresees the facts constituting a crime occurring and does not believe its occurrence to be contrary to their will is deemed to have intent.</p>

<p>An actor who foresees the facts constituting a crime occurring but is confident that it will not occur is deemed to have been negligent.</p>
<p>Article 15 One who has a legal duty to prevent a certain result from occurring and can prevent it but does not, is the same as one who actively causes the result to occur.</p>
<p>One who, through their own actions, creates a risk of a certain result occurring has a duty to prevent its occurrence.</p>
<p>Article 16 One shall not be exempted from criminal responsibility due to ignorance of the law. However, the penalty may be reduced according to the circumstances. If one is confident that their act is permitted by law and has legitimate reasons, they may be exempted from punishment.</p>
<p>Article 17 If a crime causes a certain result to occur for which the penalty is increased, it shall not apply if the actor could not have foreseen its occurrence.</p>

<p>Apart from the provisions of the preceding two paragraphs, the severity of the penalty is determined with reference to the standards of the preceding two paragraphs. If it cannot be determined according to the standards of the preceding two paragraphs, it shall be determined according to the circumstances of the crime.</p>

<h3>Chrysanthemums and Tao Yuanming</h3>
<p>— Yao Tianyu</p>
<p>Autumn deepens, and the chrysanthemums of the eastern fence are all blooming with their rare and beautiful flowers, exuding their cool fragrance, decorating the autumn sky, appearing extremely refined and beautiful.</p>
<p>Other flowers flaunt their charms to people in the spring and summer seasons with a flamboyant and alluring attitude, but only the chrysanthemum appears in this late autumn season. Even under the oppression of harsh wind and frost, it will not yield. This shows its aloofness and extraordinary spirit.</p>
<p>Because of the chrysanthemum's aloofness and striving spirit, I thought of Tao Yuanming.</p>
<p>He was a poet with a backbone of pride, his thoughts were lofty, and his character was outstanding. When he was serving as "Magistrate of Pengze," one day, a supervisor was going to see him. Someone advised him to put on his official robes and pay his respects, but he arrogantly retorted, "I cannot bend my waist for five pecks of rice!" So he abandoned his official position and returned to his homeland.</p>
<p>He had no fondness for other flowers, only a special love for chrysanthemums. Perhaps it was because the chrysanthemum's character coincided with his temperament? Although his homeland was desolate, the chrysanthemums he planted filled the garden. Although he was unemployed and lived a simple life, he was very "contented and at ease" with the chrysanthemums as his companions, drinking his wine, and writing his poems.</p>
<p>Now, when people talk about appreciating chrysanthemums, they must also flaunt a so-called "Yuanming obsession." But how many people today can possess the same lofty thoughts and outstanding character as him? Many people are desperately flattering dignitaries to seek promotion, or they are selling their own valuable personality and soul to be tools and running dogs for others to command. These vulgar people can just appreciate the chrysanthemums if they want to (but if the chrysanthemums had feelings, they might not welcome these people to "appreciate" them, right?). Why bother to disgrace Mr. Tao's noble reputation?</p>
<h3>Crab Feast Under Red Maple Leaves</h3>
<p>— Huang Qingbai</p>
<p>When the reed catkins turn old and white, the maple leaves become drunk and red. Standing quietly at the gate of the thatched cottage, the wind from the fields paints the clear scenery with a layer of greyish-brown. Looking at the car like a black ox on the road, it evokes the emotion of missing friends - "Are you tired of the city? On Sunday afternoon, I'll set up a crab feast for you under the red maple leaves. The chrysanthemums are especially yellow this year, come on." -</p>
<p>On the fifth day after the pink invitation was brought by the postman, six city dwellers with the smell of coal smoke were sitting around in a low, old-fashioned skylight hall, talking and laughing, as if they had all forgotten their own homes. The city dwellers sat under the red maple leaves and argued about the types of chrysanthemums. The crabs had already changed into their red guest-greeting attire in the black iron pot.</p>
<p>"Drink as much as you can, twilight is the time to be drunk. I'll prepare a sweet betel leaf soup for you," my wife said, wearing a white apron over her dark cheongsam, with her hair in a hurried mess and a sweet smile on her face. As the crab shells were being peeled, friends began to shower me with envious words, "Happiness!" They didn't care that the red maple leaves were falling one by one, only drinking the mellow wheat shochu.</p>
<p>"Tearing these crabs apart is like tearing oneself apart for those who are not happy. Isn't one being torn apart and eaten by others?" a friend said, filled with deep sorrow. But "Why be so sentimental? Look, when the maple leaves fall, aren't the chrysanthemums blooming? The crabs are inexhaustible, they still have claws that can pinch people." In the rose-colored twilight, the red maple leaves turned purple, and everyone felt a chill.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Obsession</h3>
<p>— Jin Xiongyu</p>
<p>Seeing other people's potted chrysanthemums, I was reminded of the interesting story of Mr. Zhang's chrysanthemum obsession in my hometown. Chrysanthemums sprout from dormant roots in spring, are divided and transplanted in summer, and bloom in late autumn. There are many varieties. "Li Shizhen said there are nine hundred varieties." They are roughly divided into two types: those with purple stems, fragrant aroma, and sweet taste are true chrysanthemums, for the enjoyment of poets and writers; those with green stems, a mugwort-like aroma, and a bitter taste are commonly called wild chrysanthemums, used for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, surnamed Zhang, is already in his seventies, full of vigor. Besides poetry and books, he has a mania for growing chrysanthemums. Every year, he plants as many as a thousand pots. The variety and refinement of his cultivation are the best in the county. Behind his house, there is a vacant lot, which he has turned into a garden, surrounded by a fence. Passersby often see Mr. Zhang bending over on the chrysanthemum path, supporting and nurturing them in every way. He also hires two workers to specialize in moving, transporting, and irrigating. The garden gate is heavily guarded, and only those with similar voices and interests can enter.</p>
<p>I have had a family friendship with Mr. Zhang for generations, and I get to visit him from time to time. I remember last year today, when the flowers were blooming all over the garden, the fragrance of the flowers filled the room, and offerings were placed on the altar in the hall, which was quite elegant. So I invited friends and companions to gather together, holding crab claws with wine cups, and making a pair with the birthday celebrant in the scenery. Soon, wine glasses were exchanged, some recited poetry, and some painted pictures, the joy was boundless. Some of the guests who were of the same background, continued to linger and examine the chrysanthemums in detail. At the time, Mr. Zhang also left his seat, following the guests on both sides, guarding against any elegant acts that might lead to the dispersal of good varieties. I thought there might be suspicion of impropriety, so I stood by with my hands in my sleeves and offered congratulations.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the thirteenth year of the Republic, during the dispute over the fast, troops were stationed in my hometown for several days, and we also suffered from it. Among the military officers, there was one who liked chrysanthemums. He passed by Mr. Zhang's garden, just as the chrysanthemums were beginning to bloom. So he entered the garden with his guards, selected a few of the best varieties, and took them away. When Mr. Zhang found out, he was filled with anger, saying that a scholar could be humiliated, but flowers could not be insulted. He quickly chased after them, shouting and running, even though he was sweating profusely, he did not give up. When the military officer saw his pitiful state, he was moved by compassion and returned the flowers to him with a smile. To this day, it is still told as a pleasant story, and everyone calls him Duke Chrysanthemum.</p>
<h3>Ways to Eat Crab</h3>
<p>— (Lu Shifang)</p>
<p>(1) Fried Crab: Place the crab in a pot, add a little water, and cook it thoroughly. When eating, add soy sauce and shredded ginger, which is extremely delicious. This method of cooking is very simple and best preserves the true flavor of the crab, but it is best to use large crabs.</p>
<p>(2) Soy Sauce Crab: Cut a crab in half along the navel, coat it with flour, put it in a frying pan and fry it, then add soy sauce, wine, etc., and simmer for a while until cooked. It is also very delicious to eat, but it is slightly greasy.</p>
<p>(3) Stewed Crab: Break off the crab's claws and legs, put them in a bowl with the torso, add a little soy sauce and wine, and steam in a pot until cooked. The taste is quite delicious.</p>
<p>(4) Drunken Crab: Soak a smaller crab in wine (it must be thoroughly soaked), store it in a jar, and seal the mouth. After a few days, take it out and eat it, which has a different flavor.</p>
<p>(5) Crab Meat: After frying the crab, peel off the meat and fat, which is called crab meat. If you stir-fry it with shredded pork or tofu, it tastes very delicious.</p>
<h3>Talking About Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Wu Yuanzhai</p>
<p>In previous years, on my late father's banner, there was a poem about chrysanthemums by Zhu Yuanzhang, which I saw often when I was young, so I memorized it well, and I still remember it today. The poem says: "A hundred flowers bloom, I do not bloom, if I bloom, all will be startled. I want to fight a battle with the west wind, and wear a golden armor all over my body." It is a poem about yellow chrysanthemums. Zhou Maoshu called the chrysanthemum the hermit among flowers. Tao Jingjie was originally a noble hermit, and his nature was close to it, so he loved chrysanthemums alone and regarded them as his confidants. However, since Zhu Yuanzhang, a feudal monarch, wrote chrysanthemum poems, they contained imperial ideas, which overflowed in his words. Zhu Yuanzhang was originally a rogue commoner, who leaped to the throne and became an emperor. Success meant he was a king, failure meant he was a bandit. After he became emperor, he later became suspicious of scholars, suspecting that writing meant plotting rebellion, and suspecting that saying "sheng" (生, meaning to be born) meant saying "seng" (僧, meaning monk), suspecting that people were scolding him for having been a thief and a monk. Using homophonic characters, he committed a great taboo and started an unnecessary literary inquisition, killing many innocent officials. His line "wear a golden armor all over my body" is the same tone as Xiang Yu's words when he saw Qin Shihuang on his tour, "He can be replaced." In the world, any kind of thing has its own psychological effect on the observer, as the saying goes, "The benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom, is it only true of chrysanthemums?"</p>
<p>There are indeed many people who love chrysanthemums now, but how many can be called confidants of chrysanthemums in terms of character and integrity? Human desires are rampant, and there are indeed many who harbor thoughts of wealth and honor, even seeking "wealth and honor through injustice." The peony is a flower of wealth and honor, and there are really many people who can be confidants with peonies. The true confidants of chrysanthemums are probably not as many as that. "The most difficult thing in life is to find a confidant," not only is it true of people, but chrysanthemums also have such sympathy.</p>
<p>Previously, in a certain newspaper, I saw an article that overturned the case, cursing chrysanthemums, saying that chrysanthemums are opportunists and have a pungent odor, simply saying that chrysanthemums have no value at all. Such sharp writing cannot be called "a wonderful article that promotes the old and brings forth the new." But I really feel wronged for chrysanthemums!</p>
<p>Cursing chrysanthemums is originally a playful joke, so I realized that people who are "isolated and unsociable" run into walls everywhere. Even though there is no reason to scold them, they still want to think of some words to curse and exclude them!</p>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>All Kinds of Crabs</h3>
<p>— Yan Beguang</p>
<p>Time flies so fast, in the blink of an eye it is time for red maples to be dyed with rouge, and yellow chrysanthemums to burst into bloom. Most poets and writers will enjoy themselves in time, holding crabs and facing the chrysanthemums, old autumns and fat crabs are the first delicacies of the season.</p>
<p>I remember when I was working in Suzhou, because the Yangcheng Lake crabs had long been well-known, I had the tea servant buy two every night for a quick meal. But I could never buy the ones with golden claws and yellow hair. It is said that Yangcheng Lake crabs are different from other producing areas, with golden claws and yellow hair. When placed on a gold-lacquered table, they crawl quickly on their bellies, and their feet are strong.</p>
<p>A friend told me that even the people of Suzhou cannot eat the real Yangcheng Lake crabs. They are all transported and sold in Shanghai, and I secretly sighed that the people of Shanghai have insatiable appetites!</p>
<p>Once, several colleagues in the bureau were happily discussing, and they held a crab-eating competition. A total of eighteen people signed up to participate. It was held at the He Garden in Hanji Lane. The scenery of He Garden is very good, taking full advantage of the beauty of the garden!</p>
<p>The rules of the competition were that whoever ate the fastest, the cleanest, and the most would be the first place and would be rewarded with a silver wine cup. As a result, Mr. Ge Yunyun took the first place, spending three hours and ten minutes, eating ninety-two crabs. Everyone admired his exquisite way of eating. By midnight, he had a stomach ache like a pattern, and he hurriedly asked Dr. Wu Guangmin to give him an enema, and Mr. Gu Xuanru examined his pulse. Although he got the silver cup, it was not worth it. After all, the nature of crabs is too cold, and you should not eat too many.</p>
<p>Crabs are crustaceans in the water, and their nature is very cold. The way to eat crabs is to first use a brush to wash away the mud on their bodies in clean water. The dirt on the hairs of the two claws is even more dirty and must be washed clean. Squeeze out the crab dirt from the navel, embed a slice of ginger, a few grains of salt, and tie it with hemp thread. Put clean water in the pot, about an inch from the water surface, place a bamboo steamer, buy three coppers of perilla in a Chinese medicine shop, wash it clean, spread it flat, put the crab on the perilla, and boil the water, then simmer for a while. If there is a poisonous crab inside, the crab shell will crack open when it sees the smell of perilla. When eating, it is best to use ginger powder to mix Zhenjiang rose vinegar, but it is also good to put it in a bowl, add aged wine, soy sauce, salt, ginger, and stew it. There are also those who cut the crab in half, mix it with flour, and fry it in a frying pan, which is called fried crab, but it is not as delicious as steaming.</p>
<p>There are crab raincoats on both sides of the crab's belly. Take them off when they are hot, and rub them vigorously a dozen times on the scars of hands and feet that have been frostbitten, and by winter, no matter how cold the weather is, the hands and feet will no longer suffer from frostbite. I wish the modern girls who wear long silk stockings to try it out! I guarantee that it will definitely work.</p>
<p>There is a crab monk inside the crab's belly, which is very cold in nature. Eating it can easily make people sick. Friends who eat crab should pay attention.</p>
<p>Crabs and persimmons are contradictory. It is recorded in detail in the Materia Medica, because both are cold in nature, if you accidentally eat them, it will make your stomach hurt even more. If you accidentally feel a stomach ache after eating crabs, you can boil four cents of longan meat in soup and take it, and the pain can be stopped immediately.</p>
<p>The crab season is not long, September and October are the most seasonal, so there is a popular saying that nine are pointed and ten are round, especially in mid-October is the best time, regardless of male or female, they are all fat and full of brains. However, use a small jar, spread some grains on the bottom of the jar, then put the crab in, and then cover the crab with grains to fill it, it can be stored for two months, and when you take it out to eat, it tastes especially delicious. After eating, it is best to wash your hands with chrysanthemum leaves to avoid the fishy smell.</p>
<p>When crabs are on the market, I buy three crabs every one or two days, two round and one pointed, and go to the restaurant to supervise the waiter to wash them clean, sprinkle perilla in the steaming basket, put the crabs in, steam them hot, and eat them hot with foreign vinegar, drinking one and a half catties of wine. For the remaining crab legs, I ask the waiter to take apart the crab meat and stir-fry a bowl of crab meat and egg rice with two eggs, which feels very comfortable to eat.</p>
<p>Pregnant women should not eat crabs, because they are cold in nature, and crab claws are prone to miscarriage, so be careful! It is popularly said that eating crabs during pregnancy will cause the child to have a lot of saliva and not stop flowing, but this cannot be confirmed. Leave the crab shell until summer, grind it into powder, then add dried and ground pomfret bones, mix it evenly with sawdust, and put it in a paper tube, which is a good mosquito incense.</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on the Form and Legacy of Art</h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>I was very happy to see the disagreement raised by Mr. "Ye" on the 18th of October on my article in this publication. Indeed, "if the literary world is polite and has no debate," "that would be a sign of literary death." However, I cannot quickly access the news magazines in China and cannot conduct our discussion quickly, which I greatly regret.</p>
<p>Mr. "Ye" first pointed out that the words I said in the first paragraph of the article "The Form and Legacy of Art" have a place that "can easily lead people to this misunderstanding," "that is, to think that it is not the content that determines the form, but the writer's style in the process of artistically processing the realistic material that he has captured."</p>
<p>Here, if my clumsy words cannot fully express my meaning and cause the readers to have such a misunderstanding, then I fully accept Mr. "Ye's" criticism, except for the last sentence (which we will talk about later). But what I said there was this: "In art, the main expression of form lies in the writer's style." This may be the root cause of the misunderstanding. Of course, form and content "have an inseparable legal law." The artist's unique style is determined and formed by the social conditions in which the artist is located, as well as the artist's social life, etc. Different social conditions and different social lives make even artists who are born in the same era and the same society have different artistic styles. Even writers from the same social stratum have different styles due to their different talents and experiences. Therefore, although we cannot confuse the form of art works with the writer's style, many of the basic elements that determine the two things are common. It is obvious that style cannot completely determine form, because they are both determined by something more fundamental. But can we deny the close and inseparable connection between style and form? When we read Shakespeare's plays, in that form (of course, independent of the content), do we not first notice the bold and unique style? If my previous sentence is understood in this sense, perhaps it would not cause misunderstanding. Moreover, I went on to say: "The artist's primary task is to capture the content of art from reality, and secondly..." Compared with what Mr. "Ye" said, "The so-called artistic expression form of the writer is expressed as a secondary thing here. What becomes the first thing in the writer's artistic creation process is the writer's attitude towards reality...", I feel that except for the expression of my clumsy words that should be criticized, it is difficult to find a contrary point in the content.</p>
<p>Mr. "Ye" also confused the contradiction between the worldview and the objective historical development, as well as the contradiction between the worldview and the method of creation. And I think that the contradiction between the worldview and the objective development of history is caused by the fact that the consciousness and demands of the social group that determines and creates the worldview violate the objective development of history. And what else is there to solve all contradictions, except to practice them in practice? But this is a general statement. We must not forget: what we are talking about now is art—we are talking about the artist's worldview and method of creation!</p>
<p>Historical facts fully prove it to us. Why does a writer whose worldview and method of creation are contradictory, slowly and circuitously make his worldview tend to objective reality: while another kind of the same writer does not have this phenomenon. Except for saying that the former has the practice of a realistic method of creation, but the latter does not (of course he also "creates", but that is far from reality, not the meaning of "creative practice" that we are talking about), how else can we explain this? Please see what Mr. "Ye" said: "Balzac and Tolstoy's consciousness violated history. Because of this, they did not fully grasp the unity of worldview and method of creation. It is this that restricted their development and the fluctuating consciousness expressed in their works. However, this still does not prevent them from becoming a realist." Here, Mr. "Ye" did not explain to us at all how Balzac, etc., would achieve a great realist from "a fluctuating consciousness that violates history"; that "however" cannot be used as a bridge from the former to the latter.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. "Ye" repeatedly mentioned "the imitation of style." I repeat, this "sudden change" statement is the easiest way to make our discussion scattered and divergent. I said that it is "very worthy of our attention and taste" and "cannot be ignored," I did not say anything about imitating style. The writer's style, as mentioned earlier, is formed by the writer's social life, talent, etc. It is a common phenomenon for people who are just learning to write to imitate the style of other writers, but this is temporary.</p>
<p>I agree that inheriting the legacy of great classical writers is "related to the whole of the classical writer's method of creation." But I specifically pointed out the comprehensive form of art. Why? Because this point is "very worthy of our attention and taste." When studying this issue, how to synthesize and what to synthesize is the focus of our attention. We want to study the creative methods of classical writers in that kind of comprehensive and bold form. If this is "making the problem too narrow," I would rather "narrow it down."</p>
<h3>Coming Home (Continuation)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>At that time, I felt that this person was a bit strange. On one hand, I liked him, but on the other hand, I was also wary of him. I originally wanted to buy an overcoat to shield myself from the December cold, but I was afraid of encountering the ridiculous story in the sermons of Reverend Wakefield about Moses going to the market to sell a horse and buy spectacles. So, I simply bought some other cotton clothes. When I found out that he did not go ashore with the hawkers after leaving Hong Kong, I completely thought of him as just a kind-hearted travel companion. A fellow traveler, as long as you recognize that he is kind-hearted and not essentially bad, even if he makes you unhappy at times, you will gradually forgive him and get along with him completely. Therefore, I also started to chat enthusiastically with this travel companion who was in the habit of agreeing with others, and he certainly had the ability to make people enjoy talking with him.</p>
<p>While we were talking, his right hand was unconsciously groping inside his overcoat pocket. When I was shaking off the coal dust from my clothes (which I had to do almost every half hour), his hand came out of his pocket, along with a roll of red paper printed with regular script characters. He first looked at me with those pleasing eyes before carefully handing me a piece. It said: "Our shop has a three-story Western-style building facing the sea, with electric lights and fans, fully equipped, serving food and drinks, considerate and inexpensive..."</p>
<p>"Please be sure to stay at our shop when you come to Xiamen!"</p>
<p>What else was there to say? We had just been talking so happily, so of course, I agreed. Besides, I would have to stay at a hotel anyway. After I agreed, he wrapped his overcoat even more tightly and hurried away. I remained, watching the savage night engulf the sea and sky and the affairs of the world, listening to the bold sounds of foreign flags and wind and waves mingling together.</p>
<p>I returned to where I was staying and saw the same red paper strips pasted on the tin trunks and bamboo baskets. Other people's luggage was also pasted with the same. A sailor sitting next to me smoking saw me looking and flicked the ash off his cigarette, saying:</p>
<p>"This shop is not bad—no matter how many days you stay, the room rate is only three dollars, it's really fair and honest!"</p>
<p>On the Indian Ocean, the deck was full of people, both day and night. Now that we were on the Pacific Ocean, some of the passengers had already disembarked in Hong Kong, and the rest had been driven below deck by the cold mist and wind. So, the empty deck was left to the sailors to sell fried noodles and snacks. I put my hands in my trouser pockets and strolled around as if I were visiting a night market, with a very leisurely attitude.</p>
<p>"Hey, have a drink!"</p>
<p>I looked up and saw that it was the hotel solicitor who was greeting me. He was happily drinking with some people next to where the crane was placed, and the sailor who had just spoken to me was also sitting with them.</p>
<p>When the ship docked in the port of Xiamen, the greeters from other hotels swarmed onto the ship, vying to fly various leaflets at us, shouting the names of various hotels. He, the one who often flashed gentle glances at people, used his thumb and middle finger to make a clicking sound in front of their faces, saying:</p>
<p>"Sorry! They're all posted!"</p>
<p>The others seemed a little afraid of him and quickly walked away. He called a small boat to take our group of guests ashore, and then the three-and-a-half-story Western-style building, very old, appeared. Inside, there were no electric fans or separate small rooms, only beds with mats, disgustingly surrounding us one after another. Looking out from the window with missing glass panes, the pier with vehicles coming and going and the harbor with masts standing like forests were not far in front of the shop.</p>
<p>"Hurry up, or do you want me to skin you?"</p>
<p>He had just scolded a porter like that when he suddenly saw another porter drop the two rolls of bedding he was carrying on his shoulder onto the floor. He threw the sun helmet off his head onto the table, rolled up the sleeves of his coat, and shouted fiercely:</p>
<p>"I'll beat you to death!"</p>
<p>But he didn't actually hit him, it seemed like he was just trying to scare him. However, the entire shop was filled with his piercing voice, which would make a traveler who had spent half a month at sea, wanting to rest for a while, feel extremely unhappy. So, like several other guests, I stayed for a while and wanted to change hotels. He ran over with a smile, still flashing his ingratiating eyes, saying:</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, but the three dollars for the room must be paid, whether you stay or not. This is the old rule!"</p>
<p>He spoke the last words very harshly, as if the old rule was the law. At the same time, he looked at our boxes and baskets, which already had another piece of paper pasted on them. Although the color was the same, what was written was completely different, and it matched the contents of his shop exactly. We didn't want to stay, and we didn't want to cause trouble with him, so we gave him three dollars as he said. Even though we encountered such an unpleasant thing, it was still pleasant and happy to be stepping on our own land. But the next day on Gulangyu, when I saw the same big turbans, the same wooden sticks, and the same brown faces that I had seen in Yangon, Singapore, and Hong Kong, I once again felt a huge palm, invisibly covering my head, and a heavy tropical depression rose in my heart again.</p>

<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>The November street, flowing with a biting northwest wind, the market town is desolate, the shop is broadcasting a trembling song on the radio.</p>
<p>The farmers who go to market together, carrying baskets, folding their hands, their hungry eyes staring straight into the shop, and some are hesitating at the pawnshop door with clothes wrapped.</p>
<p>I walked quietly on the street, and returned quietly, lost in thought, at the bridgehead at the turn, I suddenly met a friend I hadn't seen for a long time.</p>
<p>—When did you come back?</p>
<p>—Just three days.</p>
<p>—Are you happy there?</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, my friend's face sank, and he froze for a moment.</p>
<p>—Coming back, everything is over!</p>
<p>—Oh… Is it?</p>
<p>—I had a small job in a company, but the company closed down!</p>
<p>—Then where are you going?</p>
<p>Without answering, I saw that his face was cramped, as if he couldn't answer a word to me?</p>
<p>—Old ×, what about you?</p>
<p>I smiled bitterly to myself and shook my head.</p>
<p>It's like all the words have been said.</p>
<p>—Old ×, it's getting cold!</p>
<p>—It's getting cold!</p>
<p>His feet rubbed against the ground, and he was about to leave.</p>
<p>—Where are you going?</p>
<p>—…Just walking around, he put his hands in his pockets, and walked away, his shoulders shrugging.</p>
<p>I stood under the bridgehead and watched his back, I thought of the pawnshop on the Zhongshi Street section of the bridge.</p>
<p>The November street, flowing with a biting northwest wind, I carried a lost sorrow, and went back silently.</p>
<h3>Scenery of Peiping (One-Act Comedy) (Two)</h3>
<p>— Xu Xu</p>
<p>Bu: You little brat! Humph! Old Han, I believe she wouldn't really go kiss her. —Old Han, right? This guy, I just don't believe you!</p>
<p>Liu: I don't want women! If I wanted to, I could get a dozen!</p>
<p>Han: Old Liu, let's help him this time! If it fails today, then he can only blame himself for being stupid, don't blame us for not helping a friend! If it succeeds, and we don't all go out to eat, then I'll definitely harm you!</p>
<p>Bu: Good! Now let's move things!</p>
<p>(So they start to move. Old Liu exits, and returns a moment later.)</p>
<p>Liu: (Carrying a plank) Old Han, come on, let's move this first, the drummer (Note 1) has already been arranged!</p>
<p>Han: (Carrying a plank) Good! Old Bu, you carry the bench!</p>
<p>(Liu and Han carry the plank and are about to exit, the shopkeeper enters,)</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Mr. Han, are you going to sell the plank?</p>
<p>Liu: Aren't you asking us to pay the rent?</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Are you going to sell my things to pay me back? Then wouldn't I sell them myself?</p>
<p>Liu: Didn't you say you wanted to spend the money?</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Yes!</p>
<p>Liu: Then wouldn't it be better to sell it to you for money? When we have money, we'll buy a new one to return to you. Anyway, it's we who sleep on it, not you!</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: How much are you selling it for?</p>
<p>Liu: Two dollars.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: That's still far from enough to pay me the rent!</p>
<p>Liu: Didn't you say to pay you one or two dollars first?</p>

<h3>Cotton Rebound After Falling Short</h3>
<p>The cotton market rebounded strongly. American cotton continued to fall, and the situation was quite weak. However, the people's hearts in this port were not affected much, because some shorts took profits and covered their positions, so the market rebounded strongly. However, the sales of raw cotton were quite sluggish.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao turned to rise</p>

<h3>October American Cotton Futures Rise in Rebound</h3>
<p>—Poor demand for spot goods—</p>
<p>The action of the New York cotton market is in inverse proportion to the previous day. May fell by 16 points, and October far-term only fell by 5 points. It is generally believed that the price root has fallen too sharply, and there is no sufficient reason, so it is engaged in buying October far-term. However, trust was greatly shaken due to the continuous decline in market prices, and local and foreign floats were quite numerous (December period). Demand for spot cotton is slow everywhere. The estimated quantity published by the Chicago Company is 9,670,000 bales. The quantity in the previous month was 9,230,000 bales. The government is now an important subject that controls the market. If you want to solve the current situation, Washington must have a new method. British cotton futures fell 9 to 10 points. Indian cotton was weak due to disappointing Liverpool news and speculator selling. It is estimated that Pingle rose by 2.5 corners, Aomla remained unchanged, and Zi Luo Creek fell by 7.5 corners. Gu Dian recorded left. (One day report)</p>
<h3>There is a saying that the tariff rate of grain and foreign wheat will increase again, and the flour rebound is also rapid</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, showed a sharp rebound in each month. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago near rose by 7.0 corners, far-term by 4.0 corners, and Canada rose by 56 corners. Therefore, when the opening price, due to the sharp decline the previous day, only a turnaround occurred, and the price of foreign wheat rose, so inside and outside speculators bought together, so the opening price was about 34 points higher than the previous day. The second board was still in good shape, and after the third board, due to the return of some bulls, it fell back by two points. The transactions of each board are still smooth, because the speculation gangs are unusually lively in and out. Until the afternoon opening, each month rose sharply again, because the market rumored that the tariff rate of foreign wheat would be increased again, and the Fujian gang had some spot transactions, so the bulls raised the price even more. Recently, the market has been completely driven by speculative activities, and there is actually no need to consider it. As a result, this month rose by 4.75 points compared to the previous day, December rose by 5.75 points, January rose by 5.5 points, February rose by 6 points, March rose by 6.25 points, and April rose by 6.5 points.</p>
<h3>Canada's minimum price limit and the Sino-U.S. wheat prices rise together</h3>
<p>—Attached is the calculation method of answering wheat prices—</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market (after the opening in the morning and afternoon, each month showed a rebound. The quotation of foreign wheat, Chicago rose by 4 to 7 corners, and Canada rose by about 56 corners. In the morning, people's hearts had gradually risen, and transactions were quite active, which was 356 points better than the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the flour market rebounded, and outside customers also tried their best to enter, so the opening price of each board rose again. At present, most of the flour and wheat markets are shifted by foreign wheat. How about actual sales? On the contrary, they paid less attention, so the sudden rise and fall were less certain. As a result, November and December rose by 9 points, and January rose by 1.1 points. February rose by 9 points. The current wheat market was slightly soft and tired, down 34 points compared to the previous day. Kaishan Dong Xuzhou wheat was 3 yuan 8 corners and 1 point, Yaowan wheat was 3 yuan 8 corners, and Yangzhou wheat was 3 yuan 7 corners and 2 points, totaling 25,000 packages, which were handled by Fuxin.)</p>
<p>The Winnipeg mixed grain price, from today (1st), has been set by the government, with the minimum price for December being 7.5 corners and May being 8 corners, giving Chicago a good impact, coupled with strong spot goods and strong local potential, the price rose sharply by two points. When the Winnipeg price is set, although it has not been announced when it will stop, it is generally believed that this is temporary, and there will be other methods in the future.</p>
<p>According to the Chicago wheat report on November 1, the average yield of spring wheat is 7 bushels per acre, and the total production is 80 million bushels. Once the abandoned fields are finally determined, the production may be less than what is currently indicated. The winter wheat production estimate is 386 million bushels, so this year's wheat production will be 466 million, and domestic demand is estimated to account for 650 million ○</p>
<p>Recently, there have been inquiries about how to calculate the difference in the rise and fall of foreign wheat in the newspaper's wheat market news, and what unit is used for the Chicago wheat market. The answer is as follows: The degree of rise and fall of foreign wheat in the wheat market news is calculated by converting the foreign wheat market into a ton to calculate the difference. For example, if the Chicago wheat price was 95.25 on the previous day and 97.75 on this day, and rose by 2.25, this is the price of one American bushel. Thirty-three American bushels are one ton, then multiply it by 33, that is, one ton of American wheat rose 54.25 US cents compared to the previous day. The Chicago wheat market is priced per bushel (commonly known as American bushel, abbreviated as bushel), and the price is in US dollars "cents".</p>
<h3>New Thin Rice Fell Corner Xu</h3>
<p>Hunan Various gangs have a relatively strong source, with a total of nearly 60 numbers and nearly 9,000 stones of goods, mostly thin rice. The market situation of six types of thin rice happened to encounter a weak stomach, so it presented a downstream strategy. It is estimated that the Qingdao gang adopted more than a hundred bags of Xinzhen Liuzhongyi, and the retail sales were limited, and the corners were falling. However, Yebaidao and other thick new japonica rice can still invigorate the sales in this street, and the arrival of goods is slightly more, and it is still possible to stand out due to the thin rice constraints, and if a small number of goods are still tight, the situation is quite impressive. As a result, it shows a few points of beauty. Du Yangjian is quite suitable for the store's taste, and the market color accounts for a fresh foot, and the yin change yuan supply and demand are similar, and there is also a sign of turning to stability.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 40 shops arrived in the north of Shanghai from the inland towns and villages under the river, and more than 100 ships were stored in the river. Each of the market's goods went to the stomach, and the new japonica rice, broken japonica rice, Chen Baiyuan Xin Du Jian retail sales were deserted in the early market, and slightly more in the afternoon. The thin rice early rice Yinyuan was still good, and the new Yang Xian Xin Chenbu customers lost their ordinary value. The market shape New Japonica high goods stood up, and the middle and second tiredness went beyond the corner, and the price of Broken Japonica New Yang Xian Xin Chenbu customers Xian was stable, the thin rice early rice soft momentum, the Chen Baiyuan price was a small corner, and the Yinyuan Xin Du Jian stood up.</p>

Although there are arrivals, they are available as they arrive, and it is not easy to accumulate in the market, and the inland of denaturing is extremely greedy, and the Mu Street also has social events. Especially the grinding and rough items are over-supplied, and yesterday it rose by two corners again. The machine indica only rose by a few points, covering the newly arrived Saigon. On the whole day, 1,500 bags of Xiang grinded, 350 bags of machine rice, and 5,000 bags of Hubei Shashi rice were opened, and 400 bags of Zhangzhou Jian were opened, most of which were handled by inland.

Yesterday, 25 packages arrived, and there was a scene of vying for it in the market. The market continued to rise by 6 corners, and there may be no retreat in the future.

The market price is rising step by step. Yesterday, the red shell grain in the market has opened 3 yuan 07 points, and the red shell is 3 yuan. The unified city is written into three or four vehicles. The later situation depends on the amount of sources, which is the goal of ups and downs.</p>

<h3>Major Securities and Bond Market Players Wait and See</h3>
<p>—Retail Investors are Silent—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange's market fluctuated steadily, and trading became even quieter. Most long and short players are holding a wait-and-see attitude. Major players rarely enter and exit the market. Retail investors' buying and selling are carefully checked. The environment has no favorable changes. The market price is becoming dull. Interbank lending is stable. People's hearts are stable. The future should still have a period of fluctuation. The longer the brewing, the more forceful the 盗勞汉. Once it changes, it should be more intense. Yesterday's process, the first two rounds in the morning, first weak and then strong, only fluctuated by about 5 fen to 1 jiao. The market atmosphere was idle, and everyone seemed to be watching from the sidelines. The afternoon was relatively strong, and the opening continued to be good by 1-2 jiao, which was mostly due to retail investors buying. The closing trading volume was still sparse. The previous series continued to be firm, and the latter series showed slight weakness, but the number was very small, and the overall situation did not deviate from fluctuation. The final market price was slightly better by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 2 jiao or so. After the supervision tax, it was slightly lower, and the trend was not worth mentioning. The total turnover was 7.85 million yuan. 40 shares of the Exchange were listed. The result of the increase and decrease is compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share).</p>
<h3>New York Railroad Stocks' Foothold is Unstable</h3>
<p>New Feng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (1), the New York stock market fell due to the weakness of railroad stocks and New York coal gas. The reason for the weakness of the former is not very clear. The latter fell due to poor operating reports. The servicemen had tested railroad stocks and learned that the stock's foothold was unstable. Selling increased, stopping only when there was considerable support. The American rubber industry decided to increase tire prices by 12,000 to 25% from today. However, rubber stocks did not react, and each stock rebounded slightly at the close. Bond market fluctuations were mixed. Small exchange stocks were very slightly uneven. Chicago wheat was strong due to seasonal reasons, and rose due to Liverpool's strength and the Canadian government's support in Winnipeg. The total daily turnover was 540,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Transshipment Raw Sugar White Sugar Initially Fell and then Tightened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and tired as before. The Association's price for 24 raw sugar, ordinary white spot goods was 18.8 yuan. The original price for entrants was still 7 jiao and a half, and it was not completed. 本械貨 was 18.85 yuan, with a little trading, 5 fen less than the previous day. Transshipment goods had 500 bags sold by囤户, only 5.42 yuan, a drop of 1 jiao and 3 fen compared to the previous fall. After the turnaround, there was no continued sale. The price for No. 89 was still high at 10 yuan, 2 jiao. The transshipment price rose to 5.2 jiao, with a slight transaction. 本廠綿白 was stable. Zhenji No. 1 was 17.3 jiao, and Zhenyu No. 1 was 17.2 jiao, without change. The Guangdong gang opened dozens of bags of higher 那利白, 18.3 yuan. The Chao gang opened more than 100 bags of newly arrived white bags of 冲提青, 12.8 jiao. Oil bags also reduced the price of 降港青 to 11.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Orchid Seeds Rise Again by About 1 Yuan</h3>
<p>The recent arrivals of orchid seeds have been gradually decreasing, and customers have been frequently requesting price increases, so the prices of the goods that have arrived before and after have been increased, except for a small number sold last week. It was heard yesterday that a part of the goods had been traded, and the market price rose by about 1 yuan compared to the previous price. However, as the market price rose, sales inevitably became stagnant, as the current market has rebounded by 5-6 yuan compared to the lowest price. It is temporarily 협平. Since there is still a shortage of goods, it is still necessary to prevent continued tightening.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea, Zhenmei Edge Tea Trading is Still Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the major foreign firms, Yingzhuang Xiehe Tongfu Tianxiang Jinjiang, etc., in Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other places of Zhenmei edge tea had strong purchase appetites. The citywide transaction was more than 1,300 boxes. The top price of high-end Zhuang 抽芯货 in Wuyuan was 130 yuan. The 抽芯货 in Tunxi was sold at a ship price of 112 yuan. In addition, the legal route for needle tea and delicate tea and other green teas was also active. The green tea market was slightly stable.</p>
