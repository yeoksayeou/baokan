<h3>新稅則與棉織業</h3>
<p>— 經</p>
<p>最近修訂之海關進口稅則。己於本月三日起施行。聞此次稅則修訂。財</p>
<p>部當局。斟酌輕重。煞費苦心。如奢侈品稅率之增加一則以充裕國庫再則以奬勵節檢。凡此設施。自爲識者所贊許。然以去年五月二十二日公布之稅則與今茲新稅則之内容相比較。其最足使人注意之處。尚不在乎供給少數人消耗之奢侈品。而在於大宗進口之必需品。如棉紗布疋。海産物及糖紙等類之貨物皆是也。他姑不論。單以紡織品言之。猶憶去年五月間。適當民國十九年中日關稅互惠恊定三年滿期之際。我國財政當局。鑒於自恊定締結後。日本進口棉織品三十三種所納之關稅。比較當時通行進口稅率大抵减低百分之三十至四十。不啻予以分外之保護。故爲扶植本國棉織業起。見乃有相當提高紡織品進口稅之事實。此項稅則提高後。其發生之影響約有二端一爲國家稅收之增高。二爲日棉進口之打擊。是以我本國慘澹經營之棉織業尚居相當有利之地位。詎知互惠恊定旣經滿期日本棉貨向所憑藉之優勢。雖歸喪失。而在我通商口岸之日本棉織廠。則反至積極擴張棉織品之非法偷稅事件。亦竟應運而生。聞在此一年之間。紡織品之偷運。己使國庫蒙重大之損失。長此以往。其數自更可驚。此次關稅修訂棉織品之稅率减輕。而原料棉花之稅率加重。其結果可以防止幾多之偷稅事件。固未可逆料而其不足以限制日本在華棉織廠之擴張。則可斷言。財政當局延聘專家研究稅率之修訂。爲時頗久。而新稅率之輕重。亦必經立法院審議。然後呈請國府公布實行。個中手續繁重。本非率爾操觚者可比。無如新稅率雖經公布。未盡洽人期望。華廠巳有不滿之表示。此則不能不令人扼腕者也。</p>
<p>夫以課稅目的爲區别國家關稅本有財政關稅與保護關稅等之分財政關稅。所以增加國庫之收入者也。保護關稅。所以扶植國内之産業者也然如財政當局以防止偷運爲减低棉織品進口稅之理由竊恐揆諸財政關稅與保護關稅之原則。兩無所取。何則。减稅以後。國庫收入與夫本國棉織業前途將蒙重大之打擊。而偷運之能杜絶與否。恐尚未可知也。</p>
<p>當今世界列强方以高築稅壁爲商戰之武器以産業落後之我國。更何能獨逃於例外。年來洋貨傾銷於我市塲者。幾於無孔不入。我縱不能雄飛於世界之商業舞台。至少亦不應解除純然自衛之武器。紡織業爲我最發達之實業。己爲國人所公認。然以數十年之死力掙扎。至現在尚不免於困頓萬狀。此次新稅率實行後。行見外貨之傾銷益力。營業益難。卽有金融界援助。亦恐難以爲繼。一旦實業巨擘之紡織業而果至不能存立。則其他各業。又安能獨爲繁榮之計。今所望於政府者。惟有以救濟國民經濟爲注意焦點對於此次頒布之新稅則。加以鄭重之考慮。其關於棉織品部分者。尤應繼續去年五月間修訂稅則時之初衷。對於外國紡織品加以相對的限制。則我奄奄一息之本國棉織業。或有苟延殘喘之可能歟。</p>

<p>春秋御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯　　太后的食慾之强，乃是我所永遠引爲非常詫異的。在宫裏頭，或當伊在御園中散步的時候、或在便殿中閑坐的時候，伊往往要吩咐太監們去把特製的輕便小爐竈取來，就在伊自己的面前，讓那些廚夫烹調起來，伊便在旁邊立候着等吃。　　在這一次上奉天去的車上，伊只要稍覺有些飢餓，或竟絶非飢餓，只是覺得肚子裏並不怎樣飽滿，伊立刻會下令停車；同時，吩咐廚夫們預備餐點。太后的命令一下去，當然非同小可··那五十名甲廚夫便立卽催督他們的助手！丙廚夫，趕快把爐子裏的火生起來··於是那五十名丙廚夫便像做什麽團體操似的一齊用力揮動他們的葵扇，把爐子裏的煤球生得像血球一樣的紅。這時候，太后正靠在車窗上閑眺着鐵路兩旁的風景。本來在這些地方，少不得總有幾個鄉人在耕種，或走動，可是因爲太后的御用列車將在這裏經過的關係，預先己由當地的該管官廳把一切人等全約束住了，禁止他們在附近行動；所以太后也不能見到半個人影了。　　爐火生旺之後，那五十名乙廚夫便忙着把應用的原料和醬油糖酷之類，紛紛搬送給甲廚夫；甲廚夫就各自用心，調製起來。待到許多的菜全煮好了，便由那些太監用食匣端出去。因爲菜實在是太多了，所以每次來端菜的太監，總可以排成很長的一行。可是待他們端出去的時候，太后或者己不覺得餓了，於是這些菜便照舊的退回那四輛權充御膳房的車上去；列車也就繼續前進。這一次的停車，便完全失却了進餐的目的，等於是專爲要讓太后欣賞伊自己所統轄着的土地而停的。不過在旁邊侍候着伊的人，聞到了那股熱騰騰的香味，却己個個饞涎欲滴了！　　我也是其中的一個。我的肚子彷彿是永遠不會覺得飽的！（七五）黄梅的變態  烟橋　　黄梅時節，是南方人最憎厭的，從前有過一椿詩的訟案，甲說黄梅天是睛天多，舉「梅子黄時日日晴」爲證。乙說不對，前人分明說過「黄梅時節家家雨」啊，不是適相反麽？兩下就爭執不休，給丙和道了，笑道··「二公各有理由，不能判定誰曲誰直，因爲這時候晴雨不時，晦明無定，也有詩爲證··便是「熟梅天氣半陰晴」啊。况且俗語有「黄梅天十八變」的話，那麽日日晴，家家雨，可以說都對，也可以說都不對，這一席話，把甲己兩詩翁解開了。　　但是今年的黄梅天，又換換花樣了，刮大風外，並没有雨，農家所渴望的「梅水」竟涓滴不見。本來蘇州人家都在黄梅天把大缸盛着天落水，以備一年烹茶之用，以爲梅水極佳，可以經年不變。徐士鋐吳中竹枝詞云··「陰晴不定是黄梅，暑氣薫蒸潤綠苔，瓷甕競裝天雨水，烹茶時候客初來。」我把他改成··「幾無人識是黄梅，絲雨何曾濕綠苔，應是天公十變，朝朝夜夜送風來。」　　有許多北方朋友，住不慣南方的，在這時候都要學那燕子到了秋天自南而北了。的確黄梅是個可憎厭的節候，張蒙溪說··梅當作霉，霉雨善汚衣服。霉與黴通，許愼說文，黴物中久雨靑黑也。凡是衣服書畫，黄梅天都要生霉，這種時凉時熟的氣候，使一切蟲　易於滋生，所以那輩竊負文名，專吮人血的蚊蟲，大肆猖獗了。南方的人們，每年有一度可憎厭的遭逢，也可以算得觸「霉」頭了。納凉温話  梅雪　　在這六十年中六月裏天氣僅有此熱的年頭兒，要是跟着衆人，也在那裏嗟熱，歎熱，怨熱，恨熱，甚至於做幾篇憎熱駡熱的文章，在報紙的副刋上發洩他們熱的煩悶，但是他們不想到閱報諸君正在悶熱的當兒，想在報紙上博些眼目淸凉，而所見的又都是憎熱駡熱的文章，豈非悶上加悶，熱上加熱麽？小子却不肯助熱爲虐，替熱的權威做宣傳員，只把公園中綠陰下的納凉漫話，介紹與一般欲圖眼目淸凉的閱者諸君··　　一位老先生，是曾在湖北做幕友的。他說··「端方做鄂撫時，每喜嘲弄屬員，恒使受之者啼笑皆非。有一天。屬員捉到一種攻破隄岸的水族東西，其名呌做「　」獻往撫轅，給午帥過目。端方知道屬員是來獻殷勤的，故意把這　看了又看，便道··「看這東西是很循良的，不像便得攻破隄岸。」屬員必恭必敬的答道··「回午帥話，這東西的頭部是很厲害的。」端方道「怎樣厲害」？屬員道··「他會鑽」。端方嘖嘖稱異道··「這蠢東西也會得鑽麽？屬員聽了，不由的面如重棗。　　一位老先生，是在公館中做敎讀生涯的，時時談及敎讀的事。學生問他··「爲什麽稱人兒子呌做公郎，這可是天下爲公的麽」？他說··「這是封建時代的名詞，公侯的子息，不稱公子，便稱公郎。」又向學生說··「我有一對，你可對來，公侯的子息，無非公郎」。學生脫口而對道··「皇后的丈夫，不是皇帝」。先生道··「皇后的丈夫，當然是皇帝，怎說不是」？學生道！「電影皇后。歌舞皇后，學校皇后的夫丈，難道都是皇帝麽？」先生連連磋歎，以爲天然巧對。　　來函　六月二十八日貴欄内，烟橋君所作之金魚話舊，内引用岳珂程史··「逆曦之歸蜀，汲湖水浮載，凡三巨艘以從。」而按語曰··曦是秦檜的兒子，從杭州到西川，巨艘載魚，可算得愛魚成癖，千古無兩了。　　愚按　曦是吳曦，吳玠之姪孫，吳璘之孫，吳挺之子，三世鎭蜀，爲南宋功臣。至曦而叛，割四州降金，金人封爲蜀王，後爲安丙所誅。此人與姓秦的無干，本文指爲檜之兒子，所謂「君子惡居下流，天下之惡皆歸焉」之意歟？（張德馨）新生活運動之謎　　在十年前，曾與同事晚間各製燈謎多條，黏於燈上，互相猜射，引以爲樂，其時同事達三十餘人，鈎心鬥角，頗饒興趣，曾擬一謎面云··「相貌堂堂，淸疏模樣，歎國事淪胥要滅亡，因此上，把禮義廉恥，拿來提倡。」射成語字二，謎底爲「張羅。」以「堂堂乎張也」切張字，以「羅羅淸疏」切羅字，下數句以禮義廉恥切四維，羅字分寫爲四張，張羅卽張四維也，羅字上半，雖係横目，但借用代作四字，亦未始不可，不意十年以後，恰合現時提倡新生活運動的語調，撫今追昔，能無嘅然，古人十年生聚，十年敎訓，十年前啞謎語，竟成十年後新生活運動，實爲意想不到，但後此十年，生活是否革舊更新？國事是否由弱轉强？是在國人好自爲之，（達齋）東北四連長  張恨水第三十一回　　三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣　　全營殉國赤眼入槍林　　這銀裝的世界，在夜幕張開了以後，本慢慢的有些糢糊，大地成了銀色的灰海，這時槍砲開了火，火光映照着雪海，那些人的影子，在火烟裏搖撼着，隱約可見。寨子裏的守軍，對了敵軍的東西也是拚命射擊。這因避開了自己夾攻的伏兵，又故意要截斷了敵軍的去路。霹霹拍拍，哄。唧唧嗚嗚，刷！各種聲音，隨了火花四起。敵軍東面兩面，都感到受着威脅，覺得只有衝開了寨子，才是一條活路，因之他們由北向南壓迫，也是對寨子北門進攻。在雪地裏就刋成三道火光，雪映着，像三條翻騰不定的火龍一樣。趙自强知道寳營長還分着一部分弟兄去守寨子東南門呢，却是容不得敵軍再進，領着弟兄在深雪裏蛇行，對了敵人那個光圈，極力的和敵人黏着。趁着機會，却在敵人後面放射一陣。敵人分着一部分人保衛後方，不敢十分猛進，這樣相持到了晚上三點鐘，兩方除傷亡了的人不算，在雪地裏也凍傷了不少的人。因之砲聲漸漸稀鬆火光也息了，又各没有前進，這是彼此沉靜着候變化的形勢。果然，寨子那面，一響也不響，約莫有半小時之久，在寨子外面頭一道戰壕的所在，忽然發現槍聲了。這相距敵人，也只有兩千米達，守寨的軍隊，也變了進取的形勢。趙自强，和寳芳約好了的，他們出了寨子，這裏就預備衝鋒。因之他悄悄的遞了一個暗號，通知了全連弟兄。這個時候，一連人受着傷亡，己經只九十多個人，大家由兩崖下來，進行到夾溝外一個斜坡上，疏開來並没有多大的陣綫，這時得了暗中互傳的口令，各人便將左手拖了槍，右手在背上㧞了大刀，漸漸爬進。敵人現在己經明白，後面的人不多，以爲寨子裏出來了，必是那邊先衝過來，因之全副精神，都注意在前面。（四二六）物踪所全穹窿攬勝記  楊劍花　　吳郡之西多山，每至春秋佳日，四言來遊者，絡繹不絶。然皆限於天平虎阜靈岩鄧尉諸區，其穹窿一脈，除鄉婦村嫗侫神禮佛外，絶尠專誠往遊者。良以峯　高聳；攀登綦難焉。不慧吳門人也，　讀陳壬士所著木瀆小志，深知斯山不乏名勝古蹟，爲外人所未及道者。屢擬蠟屐往遊，乃頻年於役海上，卒卒未果。今歲孟夏以養疴里門之暇，折柬邀黄君病蝶，偕與俱往，以償夙願。黄子先期一百來蝸居，而妹倩蘇君惠厂亦適在舍，因亦同行。翌晨，朝曦初放，即披衣而起，盥漱早　畢，迺相偕就道；出城　，趁汽輪西航，是日天氣晴和，薫風駘湯；兩岸柳絲低垂，嗚禽弄喉；花香烏語，時掠鼻耳而過。久厭塵囂，胸襟爲之一滌！而麥隴靑葱，榴花吐艷；間有紅白杜鵑，照耀肯簾，益覺鮮艷可愛，令人心醉也！卓午抵善人橋鎭。捨舟登陸，向南行，約里許，至藏書廟。廟在穹窿之東南，爲朱　臣幼時藏書之所。朱家貧好學，常樵蘇以自給。擔薪且誦；其妻羞之，求去。後數稔，至長安，召說春秋，言楚辭。武帝悅之，拜爲中大夫。東越反覆，請兵被之；及平，遂拜會稽太守。其西即朱公專祠，供塑之像，其衣冠猶仍漢制焉。廟東爲湯斌林則徐二公專祠。二公撫蘇時，减田賦；興水利；鄉民感其德，爲立祠祀之。出藏書廟，往西行，第見岡　起伏，蜿蜒千里，高轟雲霄，直類天然屏障。不半里，至三淹。位在穹窿南麓。其大者，廣可數百畝，中梗柳堤。淹旁繡毬怒放，鵑花初舒；淸波蕩漾，林鳥啁啾；令人悠然神往，樂不思蜀矣！上置五閘，厥狀若橋，建築之精，殊堪驚嘆！而氣宇雄壯，尤爲湖山生色不少。風景之幽美，不亞西子也！三淹者··迺就四方山澗匯　而成，朱公因勢利導，以利灌漑；復置五閘，以制急湍；歷代名臣屢加修葺，湯林二公，其最著者也。流連踰時，折而往北，至皇駕塢，有拈花寺焉。此地水木明瑟，結搆幽雅；惟大殿巳廢，祇留斷垣殘壁忔立於榛莽荒蕪間，與長林古木相對欷噓耳！寺内左側，有淸高宗南巡御詩碑，斷折支離，巳非完璧矣。寺后爲釋家淸覺眞覺之墓，搆石爲堡，高可尋丈，崔巍壯麗，堪稱勝絶！茗憇片响，循御道西北行，己入山隖深處。翠峯環合，而隙其南。路旁古塜櫛比，咸具壯觀。復進，則山徑陡削，顚躓難行；鼓勇面上，乃抵茅蓬。維時艷陽當空，汗涔涔下，余以疲茶欲昏，就地仰臥，片刻迺甦。入顯忠寺，山僧慇　招待，欵以茶點；飫以饌麵；轆轆飢腸，於此便覺一振。與談山中掌故，亦能道其崖略，山僧泃不傖俗也！寺本朱買臣故宅，梁天監中始剏禪院，廣厦盈千，傾圮殆盡。淸季大殿燬於火就近始蓋搭茆蓬，以蔽巖佛，而符古名。殿后就岩壁塑觀世音像，而通岩泉於佛手凈缾中，涓流而下；盛以盂盤，味甘而冽，沁人心肺，遶寺旁尋徑而登，則有磐石一方，廣　約丈許。相傳朱買臣讀書其上，有文曰··「漢會稽太守朱公讀書處，正德己己都穆題記。」轉道東上，路尤嶮巇。松林間邨女傴僂砍薪，見遊客戾止，紛東索錢，蘇君一一應付，逗笑以爲樂。行里許，抵上眞觀。觀在穹窿　帽峯曲。相傳漢平帝時始建道院。淸初鐵竹道人施亮生重興，遂成鉅構。屋字連雲，氣局閎敝。觀前古樹森羅，蟠矯萬姿。趨龍王殿，晤住持法師，備承優待，並擾佳點。近適𫒽事方盛，香客蟻集。殿内香烟繚繞，冲目幾塞。遶遊一週，作别而出。時則夕陽斜照，蒼暝漸合；遙矚隅嶺湖光，猶隱約可辨。山㘭村落，巳炊烟四起矣。蹒跚下嶺。倦遊而返，抵屬巳魚更三躍，翌晨濡筆記之，以告後之好遊者。</p>

<p>申報國貨週刊第七十五期（每逢星期四出版貢獻話死路一條  仰葊　　我們一向對於國貨前途，是抱着十二分的希望，以爲政府提倡於上，人民合作於下，遲早是總可以抵制外貨，把入超國變爲出超國的。可是最近看來，不但没有希望，恐怕國貨的生命，是没有幾個年頭，都要壽終正寢了。當政府採納民意擬訂原産地貨物標記條例之初，旣可防制冒牌國貨，又可便利國人選購。乃以日人要求，不惜展期兩次，結果竟無形取消，這巳經是十分痛心的事。不料最近財政部改訂海關新稅則，將棉布，紙張，糖類，海産等，减低百分之五，這種政策，無異助長外貨的傾銷，便利外貨的販賣，而與國貨作敵。無怪滬漢棉布商人，紛紛請求政府注意改正，以救奄奄一息之國貨廠商。說者都謂日人最不滿於我國政府的，莫如提高關稅，阻止日貨的傾銷，今我屈己殉人，自動减低，適合日人之望，日人固然竟得心悅，躊躇滿志了，可是棉布業糖業紙業的廠商，坐視外貨的長驅直入，所向披靡，日陷於困苦艱難之境的，我們果有仁心，應該怎樣的惻然心動？不然，死路一條，同歸於盡，以後大家還說什麽提倡國貨？還說什麽保育實業？可恨年年壓金綫，爲他人作嫁衣裳，這句話好像爲我們寫照了。國貨談話談啤酒汽水  汪瘦秋　　夏天到了，啤酒和汽水，又逐漸的出現了！關於夏季一季中的啤酒和汽水的銷數，很是巨大，在從前都是爲外人所把持着，一季中的漏巵，的確是不少，直到近幾年來，纔有國貨的益利汽水，和烟台啤酒出現，稍爲挽回一點漏巵，然而數目也是很微末的。據說··上海一埠共銷啤酒二十九萬箱，而國貨的烟台啤酒和五星啤酒，僅佔六萬五千箱，其餘二十二萬五千箱，都是英，日，各國的出品。至於汽水，也是外貨的銷數超過國貨好幾倍，這當然是國人崇拜外貨的緣故，但是我以爲這裏面或者還有其他的原因，極願義成公司和益利公司加以研究，加以改善。　　據聞日貨的太陽啤酒，今年巳經準備跌價傾銷，以圖獨霸我國的銷塲了。而英商的上海啤酒，當然也不肯示弱，預備和太陽啤酒競爭一下。這的確値得我們的注意，我以爲國貨的烟台啤酒和五星啤酒，也應該乘着這個時期，來推廣銷路，挽回漏巵，而國人更應該加以維護，加以提倡的。夏令必需石棉功用談  魏詠箎　　古之火浣布，人視之如稀有之珍，今之石棉品，人用之爲日常之具，其難易拙巧，古今相形之下，誠不可以道里計。考石棉之性質，與火浣布完全無别，且現届夏令，吾人日在工作中求生活，每易汗流腦暈，其困苦煩惱狀况，非筆墨所能形容，如欲解答此難題，則石棉尚矣。記者現服務於實業部國貨陳列館，見有北平華元石棉行，送來各式精美出品，逐一審查，認爲深合人生需要，夏令尤宜，亟將是品之性質與功用及名稱說明之··　　石棉之性質，冬温夏凉，其名雖石，其性柔軟，旣不怕水，又不畏火，其功用，則有隔電，袪熱，防腐，除毒，之效。故出品中，有一種石棉質藥粉，藥棉。病而傷者用之，立時止血，腦炎者用之，愈於鎭氷，死者屍體用以包裹，永保不壞，是有他藥之奇，而無他藥之弊，又有一種石棉潔粉，巨厦用之結頂，永無雨漏之患，粉墻塗壁用之，旣光潔而不潮裂，大則機器鍋鑪，小則鐵櫃瓦竈，有此物加入，卽可經久耐鍊。還有石棉枕絨，與石棉織成之布，現時市面風行之枕，貴如鵝，鴨，駝，羊，各絨之枕。其性蓄熱，與腦不宜，賤如蘆，蒲，竹，草，之纖維枕。性亦易燃，以淸醒之腦，枕此極熱之物，似乎不宜。此項石棉布功用尤大，原其性凉，冬温而夏不暖，善於隔熱保温，小兒舖之，較任何纖維所織之蓆爲宜。香水與禍水  張孟昭　　紅樓夢上賈賓玉說··「男人是泥做的，女人是水做的，」惟其水是象徵着女人，所以格外與香水有緣！巴黎香水，香水精，從雲鬢，旗袍裏，麻醉到男人的鼻孔，貽害多少靑年丨戕害多少男性！並且非外國香粉不時髦！非外國香水不摩登！替外國人做侵略祖國的傀儡工具。而貽禍日烈！讀鄒韜奮君三月十九日法國通訊，「巴黎報界」一文，末尾一節，很令人感慨！他說··「香水大王古推除參加「鐵業委員會」外還自己出資創辦一種早晚報（早晚都有）名呌人民之友（Ｌａｍｉｄｕｐｅｎｐｌｅ）價錢非常便宜，比别的報紙便宜一倍早晚報合起的銷路，己有七八十萬份，（中略）關於他，有一點更値得中國人注意的，就是他反對中國很厲害，　護日本　　動　他的「古推牌」的香水，在中國的銷路却很好，賺中國人的錢來辦報打中國人的嘴巴！有位朋友很憤恨地呌我不要忘却替他宣布一下，我覺得用錢請人打嘴巴，確是不很合算，不知買「古推牌」香水者，以爲如何？云云。　　我讀完之後，覺得東四省陷落後，政府訴匪於大盜前之可卑可恥！法人古推拿中國人的錢來辦報打中國人的嘴巴！還是輕刑！日人掠我中華土地，殺我關外同胞，現在連長崎中國留日學生葉木花，也被日本學生無端刺死了！可是日貨，更暢行我國領土，這種行爲，豈但是打中國人嘴巴！简直要結果中國人的性命！如果中國人有熱血的話，快些急起直追！用「國貨」來雪恥吧！惟有靠我們自己的努力！肅淸禍水！救我國家！國貨討論活的提倡國貨法  張彰　　一天，和一位從事國貨運動的友人談天，談到國貨問題，這位朋友却站起來說道··「提倡國貨，只在嘴裏說說，紙上寫寫，這都不是提倡國貨的好方法，眞正的提倡國貨的好方法，便是在和朋友親戚交際的時候，拿眞正的老牌的國貨，去送給他們，這才是，活的提倡國貨法」，中國的國貨運動，是需要用這種方法，來推推的，離開了這種方法，而談提倡國貨，寫勸人服用國貨的文字，其效果是茫渺的，些微的，···」我坐在旁邊，聽了這種議論以後，想了一想，不禁大大地感動起來，覺得這位朋友說的話，確有道理，有向諸位讀者公開報告的必要。　　的確，我們中國的國貨運動，喝呼到現在，巳有好幾年的歷史了，可是，提倡者雖是聲嘶力竭，而入超還是一年一年的增加，一年一年的猛進，這倒底是個什麽緣故呢？我嘗思之復思之，覺得此中癥結，完全是因爲「坐而言」的人太多，而「起而行」的人太少了，提倡國貨，並不是一件時髦事，只在嘴上說說，紙上寫寫，便可以達到目的的，牠是一件實心實力，要認認眞眞去幹的事，所以，在國貨運動中，我們固然需要能言能寫的人，來做宣傳的工作，來盡「先覺覺後覺，後覺覺不覺」的責任，可是，在另一方面，我們尤其需要能「起而行」的同志，來負服用國貨推銷國貨的責任，如此雙軌齊進，國貨運動的完成，自然是一件意料中的事呀。　　可是，我們睜開眼來，細細地觀察一下，社會上能言的人多呢？還是能行的人多？假如能言的人多，而「行」的人少，那末，我們應該想法，使這般「只言而不行」的人，變爲一個「言行合一」的完人，假如，社會上能行的人多，而能言的人少，那末，我們更應該使這般能言的人，進而變爲能行的人，使社會上的一般民衆，個個趨向於一致的途徑，到了這個時候，這種境地，那才是國貨界的成功，國貨運動的成功。　　但是，怎樣才能達到這個目的呢？唯一的言法，便是在交際應酬的時候，一致地拿眞正的老牌的國貨，來做工具，因爲這是「活的提倡國貨法」，中國的國貨運動，唯有實行「活的提倡國貨法」　抆法，才有推進的可能，成功的希望。國偵消息國貨陳設櫉窗競賽的第三幕  秋紅　　走上南京路還没有過九點鐘，沿街店舖櫉窗外的鐵門，差不多一起拉開了。在華美烟公司的國貨陳設櫉窗前，我很從容地逗留了一刻。　　櫉窗裏佈置得很冷靜，在左角，掛着一幅綠色的幕，彷彿是大樹的蔭遮。綠幕的邊旁，從左到右，低低地排着一行綠草，疎扶有致。幕前幕後和綠草的終點處，都放着一塊長方形的立體木柱，柱上有三架大小不同的電風扇放着。風扇的翼子不停地轉，幕和草都在微微地動。這正是完全象徵花園的一角，設計的人是具有靈敏的頭腦的。我想，不論誰經過這裏，卽使漫不經意地一看，他也會知道這是電風扇的陳設櫉窗，雖然這櫉窗裏祗有三架電風扇。本刋徵文　　本刋定於七月十二日刋行「夏令國貨飲食品專號」，徵求佳作，每篇以五百字爲度，文字務求簡明切實，力避空談，照片漫畫一律歡迎，來稿希於六日内寄到爲幸！啟事　　導溱·巴玲·趙秉仁·李霞·陳美玉·漁艇·丁杏·曉芙·怡怡館主·麗妮·孫籌成·張彰·鑑心·天然·孟昭·士英·杏芬·克明·錢醉竹·南國佳人·肖白·俞洽成·國輝·茸餘·子根·堯天·惠民·玄萬·諸君鑒·六月份承惠稿，甚感！稿費業己結算，請卽具條蓋章，於本月六日至十日，十六日至二十日，（星期日除外）每日下午二時至四時，向本館會計處領取爲要。　　申報國貨周刋編輯室啟國貨講演最近國貨的趨勢　　兄弟，今天承貴社邀來研究提倡國貨問題，講到國貨的最近趨勢，就要想到提倡國貨的運動情形。所謂提倡國貨並非根本就有這種名詞，這是國民受了刺激才想出來的一句語。例如過去的抵制日貨，抵制美貨，抵制英貨，抵制一切外貨，那一次不是因於刺激？但是抵儘管抵，制儘管制，購買者仍大有其人，决不能强制他，因此提倡國貨便成了一種運動。熱心人士，大聲疾呼，普遍實行，巳有不少年的努力了。到了現在這種運動，巳得到相當的效果。最顯著的如··　（一）國貨産品增多　從外國進來之各物品，没有不在研究仿造，如外國人發明電泡，我們中國人也自己來製造，外國人製造火柴，我們中國人也會製造，以至於國一切的外國物品，來銷售我國内地，我國工業界就竭力去研究製造，所以各種工業出産的物品，除去重要工業，我們中國差不多都有。　　（二）提倡方法之改進　各地都盛舉國貨展覽會；如滬西國貨展覽會呀！滬南國貨展覽會呀！政府中舉行鐵道沿綫出品展覽會呀！差不多時時舉行，處處舉行。國貨展覽會從前雖然也有，但是决不若現在的多而有實效。從前開國貨展覽會；陳列各種貨品，琳琅滿目，有些人都疑是改頭換面，非自己所製造。時至今日，國人巳不這樣疑心，相信我們自己能製造這也是很可歡喜的。至於展覽會以外，因爲要使國貨展覽具有永久性起見，所以現在又演進而開設國貨公司了。上海最先所設的國貨公司，如南京路大陸商塲中國國貨公事，上海國貨公司等。到現在相繼成立的巳有不少的國貨公司，或國貨商塲，如上海，中央，中華，等許多專門推銷國貨的機關。中國國貨公司，自去年開設到年底，不滿一年，營業達二百餘萬元；其他國貨公司商塲均有相當的營業額；這些便是我國金錢少外溢數目。因之中華國貨産銷合作恊會便計畫設國貨公司五十處，分布各省市；資本最多的爲二十萬，至於十萬八萬五萬三萬；貨物都由産銷合作社集合各國貨工廠的出品供給之；開設的資本，則由本地自己供給，譬如鎭江開設國貨公司，其資本都由鎭江人士招集之。所需貨物，上海的國貨工廠便供給他，這樣他可以很少的資本做很多營業。現在各地發起設立國貨公司的很多很多，這也是很可喜歡的事。　　（三）國人心理的轉變　一般的人，對於服用國貨，都很高興，將從前以服用洋貨爲榮的心理改了過來；尤其在婦女中最易顯著，本來婦女最愛虚榮，最愛用洋貨，但是現在就有許多婦女領袖發起提倡，今年就是婦女國貨年，同時並成立婦女國貨年委員會，專作提倡工作。這種現象，對於國貨發展最關重要，諸位要明瞭婦女是握消費的權衡的呀！　　（四）政府注意　從前政府對於工商業極爲漠視，關稅尤無保障，外貨運入中國，每百元的貨色，徵了五元的稅，就可通行全國；而自己國貨呢？徵一次稅後，還要重徵，反而使國貨貴昻，不便銷售。現在關稅自主，保障此從前好得多。而政府行政方面，對於國貨也非常注意，各省主席對於國貨界都表示十分愛護的態度，不但在文字上誠懇的表現，言語上懇摯的宣言，而事實上也很有效的做了出來，這也是可喜的呀。總之國貨的趨勢，巳由提倡等空洞宣傳而近於實際工作的時代了。　　我國農村破産，工業崩潰，提倡國貨正是救濟唯一的工作。然而我們要知道現在提倡國貨實際工作的人，還是少數，並不什麽普遍的，所以我們於自己愛用國貨而外，還要呌親友大家服用國貨，如個個都有這種習慣，提倡自然能普遍了。最後我還要說聲；我們提倡國貨，不要以體面關係，在團體中或友人前，便表現着愛國，於是提倡國貨，服用國貨；如果没有人看見的地方，見了美的洋貨，就購洋貨了。所以希望諸位切切把這種毛病解除。一週間國貨新訊　　（一）財部海關進口新稅則，三日起己實行，本市關係各業，紛紛籲請救濟。因新稅减低，適爲日貨造傾銷機會，本國廠商，將無法與其競爭，一致要求收回成命，保國貨一線之生機。　　（二）國際貿易局新近計劃推銷國貨於南洋，何炳賢局長，更表示欲發展對外貿易，須注意（一）生産標準化，（二）减低成本；（三）注意國際市塲情况；（四）注於力於國際之宣傳　。　　（三）本市魚業界鉅子周望月等，發起國民海産股份有限公司，己先成立籌備處，並請實業部備案，資本定額五十萬元，内部組織，甚爲完備。　　（四）實業部謀發展國際貿易，及使外人明瞭我國貨物優點起見，特令飭海外中華商會，從速籌設國貨商品陳列所，並請外交部令駐外各領事館，督飭遵行。　　（五）上海市兩會昨　　實業部及浙省府令飭浙建廳，免征省有公路及杭江路沿綫國貨廣告費。　　記得加入國貨陳設櫉窗競賽的第一家是亞浦耳電器廠；第二家是天廚味精廠；第三家是現在正在陳設着的華生電器廠。以前的兩家，對於陳設的意義，是很豐富的，是很深刻的，可是華生電器廠這次的陳設，也有很高尚的竟義。　　綜觀櫉窗陳設的整個的色調完全是綠色和黑色兩種，不過電風扇是例外的，綠色表示夏的繁榮；黑色表示鐵的堅强。這兩種顏色，在支架電風扇的木柱上，托着綠草的木座上，作直綫相間的排列。所謂夏的繁榮，當然是綠葉成陰，草木昌茂的意思；然而國貨製造廠能够一天天地日趨發達，和夏天的草木一樣興盛時，我們中國民族的繁榮，是將要見諸於世界史上了。至於鐵，這便是製造電風扇的材料；並且暗示我們須有鐵樣堅的意志，購用國貨，才足以救國。而國貨的經久耐用，也正和鐵的性質一樣啊。櫉窗的半空中，掛着「保用十年，免費修理」的幾個字，華生電扇的優點，决不會及不上舶來品的。　　側面一座櫉窗，是華美烟公司自己陳設的紅藍買司干香烟。裔皇富麗，誰說國貨是不精緻呢？　　如果你能够抽空去參觀一次，那兩座櫉窗的　設　决不會使得你敗興而回的。</p>

<p>自由談從中學生寫作談到大衆說  尤墨君　　近幾年，常在各中學擔任國文敎科；去年同今年又曾評閱過浙江全省中學畢業會考國文試卷；我覺得我們當國文敎師的對於中學生的寫作，實在再不能忽視了。說起中學生寫作，自然不外文言同白話二種。但無論其是文言或白話，大多數巳變成非驢非馬的樣子，離開大衆很遠了。　　有位同學寫給我一封信，現在把這信第一段的原文錄在下面，請大家看看這是不是大衆所需要的白話。　　一我不知應該如何說好，所有我的那些爲著你的善意的同念而發的感激與依戀將是遠超過一半我所能用筆表達的，但是有一點我可以罰誓，憑著我的靈感和一切；我將永不會忘了你，你曾經不斷地對我作最仁慈最動人的精神上的恩錫，而且你又是那樣一個可崇敬的老師呀！　　從前白香山作詩，據說「老嫗能解」。如果這話是確實的，那末他的詩便合乎大衆語了。像上述的一段信，論其文字，不能不說它是通順而流利，然而嚴格說起來，這是寫字檯邊寫寫的白話，沙發上讀讀的白話，離開大衆眞不知有多少遠！所以換句話說，這是弄弄筆頭的白話，或高跟皮鞋式的白話。　　還有一種白話文，裏面嵌進了無數時式名詞，像什麽「進展」，「展望」，「探討」，「下意識」，「一切的一切」等，結果，··因不善運用故，語句變成費解而不通。這可以把今年浙江中學畢業會考國文試卷中的一段文字作個例，題目是「我所最敬佩的友朋」。　　「古云··」君子之交淡如水，小人之交甜蜜。斯可見古人之於交友也有如此深的探討，也許對於擇友這件事是極値重視的。故然，現在是什麽時代，不應該以十八世紀的套語來阻止這科學昌明的新宇宙間進展，而催謝了許多意志不决的中層階級。可是我們細憶一慮，就覺得古人的話，似乎不一定是絶對性的，也許有許多的見鑑是在我們之上，是適合於近時化，並不觸落社會進化的和諧，而不愧爲世界偉人的孫總理，也能打破世人的一切昏迷，注一而不三折的心理。他是承認的，因此他特以恢復古有道德古有智識來醒覺人們。這都是先知先覺者可能，而一般皆以「陳舊老廢物」，老是將棄諸耳後。」　　右列一段文字是一位初中畢業學生寫的，標點符號别字悉仍其舊。文中堆砌了許多時式名詞，像「探討」，「十八世紀」，「新宇宙」，「進展」，「中層階級」，「絶對性」，「近時化」，「社會進化」等等，弄得全段文字像天書一樣的難解難讀，而寫作亦失其效用。這種白話，可以說是囫圇呑棗式的白話，也可以說是食新不化的折話。食古不化，固不能接近大衆；那末食新不化，又怎能接近呢！　　再談談中學生的文言文。據我所知，現在還有人把「弔古戰塲文」，「阿房宫賦」等一類妙文，當做法寳，在中學生面前變把戲。結果，中學生的寫作；好一些的讀起來只覺叮叮噹噹，儼然「盛世元音」；壞的則如在叮叮噹噹之中，時聞幾聲亂鑼，怪難聽的。我可再舉一段文字如下，題目是「我所最敬佩的朋」　　「自來英雄豪傑之士，痛祖國之沈淪，而卒能奠定金甄，建不世之名者，非恃有血氣之靑年而誰？方其噴薄千丈，血誅激發之時，則雖刀鋸鼎鑊出之前，而其色不變；魍魉奇怪乘之後，而其心不恐。若項王之破釜沈舟，百戰百勝；豫讓之漆身呑炭，國士可風！前往奮發而莫之夭　者，此誠國家之棟樑，中流之砥柱，亦卽我所最敬佩之朋友也。」細讀上述一段文字，雖其中有幾聲亂鑼，像「噴薄千丈，血誅激發」及一夭　等（也許我不知其中妙音），然讀起來，通體還是叮叮噹噹的。不過，我終不解，這於日常生活有什麽用！獵取功名吧，翰林，狀元，己只能在破牆門裏高掛的匾額上看得到了。　　數千年來載道的文言的流弊哪此，十幾年提倡的白話的結果又如此。所以我們要想挽救「文運」，應趕快喚醒中學生快出「藝術之宫」，翰墨之林，而和大衆接近，這非提倡大衆語不可。不過這事體大，還得全國的中學國文敎師起來共同努力才行。（二三年七月於杭州師範）關於金聖嘆批改的水滸（下）  余楊靈　　我在「新生周刋」作「說水滸」一文，曾約略指出以上各點。那篇文章的最後是這樣的··　　我以爲「水滸」的最好的本子，是最流行的七十回本，倘能讀金聖嘆的評釋本，那是更好，因爲有許多好處，不看金聖嘆的評釋是不能知道的。七十回本唯一的荒唐處，是結末盧俊義一夢，那夢的意思，是敎人知道强盜滅絶之後天下方得太平。然而官僚政治不摧毁，强盜怎能滅絶？天下又怎能太平？　　如欲看七十回以後的事實，則寗讀俞仲華的蕩寇志，那裏面雖把一百八人一個個處死，梁山泊的集團被官軍所蕩平，但是一百八人究竟抵抗到底，至死不屈，很表現了英勇的鬥爭的精神。而且在那個作者的想像中，爲了要使一支官僚地主的軍隊打敗梁山泊，甚至非呌「雷部神將」，「客星散仙」下凡不可，這也反　看梁山泊的反抗的現實的力量。　　至於胡適之先生辛辛苦苦找了出來加以標點而行世的一百二十回本水滸，則不値一看。那裏面寫反抗官僚的梁山泊集團，終於投降了官僚，替官僚立了許多功勞，自己們却重新被官僚所壓迫，一個個的悲慘地死亡。這是把梁山泊的集團看得太無意義了。他們這樣做，究竟所爲何來？　　在這一百二十回本中。只寄託着官僚階級的無聊的希望，他們的無限的剥削和壓迫，造成了反叛，而他們的力量又不能克服這反叛，於是他們只能希望反叛者受他們的欺騙，前來降順，然後重新加以迫害。　　好聰明的辦法啊！然而眞有那樣的優子們會上當的麽？　　這種意見，不知有可取之處否？我很希望有人跟我討論，我曾談過金聖嘆的「極微論」，頗受誹謗，這回又來擁護他所批改的「水滸」，恐怕又要引起許多誤會罷？「極微論」不必再說，至於七十加本「水滸」，我總覺得有批判地接受之必要。我的意見還多，病中不能續寫，就此暫停。從麥倫中學的遊藝會出來  白薇　　若是把不久以前在女聲社的遊藝會中所得的印象搬出來，和這次在麥倫中學的遊藝會所得的印象比較起來看，你或許會覺得前者有如華貴，纖弱的小姐，哥兒，而後者是一個斬新，健康的靑年。　　從舞台上表演的技藝以至於觀客的氣象，差不多都這樣。這裏没有窈窕高貴的啟幕時的女神；也没有扭着腰肢，擺着屁股講戀愛的戲劇；舞台前旣没有一籃籃的鮮花的陳列，又没有華壓的女人和漂亮紳士一陣陣走過；觀客中也絶少摩登小姐或少爺。　　這裏有的是優越的音樂··像六月卅日晚大華口琴隊數十人的合奏己足動聽；如七月一日口琴獨奏更是悅耳，愉心。這裏有的是展開了時代的眞髓的戲劇；它，告訴你帝國主義不但是呑滅了東北四省的山河，並且呑去了東北前進又激烈的靑年的心；它，告訴了你舊禮敎的吃人，由母親的手裏，吃掉了活潑有爲的愛兒丨丨靑年；它，也告訴了你女子不能依靠男人，丈夫，女子唯一的出路是找職業，而最靠得住的是被壓迫者團結的力量。這些，都在「出走後的娜拉」中表現出來了。它在「揚子江的暴風雨」中，還表現了窮苦的碼頭工人，終天爲着牛馬不如的生活而勞動的，是在修築堆帝國主義侵略殖民地的洋米，洋麥，和軍火的堆棧。　　以上兩個劇本，抓住了目前中國最逼眞的情形。以下把它分開來說··　　「出走後的娜拉」第一幕描寫革命的太太，不能和因爲利誘而墮落去當漢奸的丈夫再繼續同成了，决然抛棄丈夫走出去··寫來緊迫，簡短，有力··演來也生動，緊張。胡萍在這幕裏發揮了她内心表演的長足進步，顧夢鶴也極盡了他旣愛妻了，又因爲想過舒服生活而墮落了的矛盾。第二幕以諷刺的筆法，暴露了宗敎的毒害「盡節」「盡孝」這種禮敎吃人··寫來有趣，玲瓏，悲劇的成分濃厚又緊凑，結構也精巧；演來更圓美，活跳。趙丹在這幕裏的靑春，活潑，俏皮，可愛，演來能自由操縱，盡情發揮他表演的天才，尤以服毒後那悲痛的調，慘澹的掙扎，爬來跌去，哀想生而陷於垂死的蠕動，悲嗚，有使人精魂震撼而血液停止的魄力，使我禁不住心上這樣喊··「有希望的演員喲珍重你的前途！」飾母親的，我不知道她的名字，但她的演藝，打動了我的深心，她聰　如法的表情和動作，一槪隨着劇文的抑揚强弱高低，恰如樂譜之隨着歌辭一樣合拍，也像花的顏色粉嫩，增加了花形的美麗般對於脚本增加了美滿，她盡量地表現了頑强固執的母親，表演了女性最可咀咒的狹窄心理！她受了禮敎和宗敎的桎梏，她永生是男子的奴隸！一切，她都唯妙唯肖地演了出來，像她，眞可說是··「帮助了作者，而完成舞台藝術的演員」而無愧。胡萍在第二第三兩幕中，只可說「不錯」而巳，因爲這兩幕裏，没有給她特别發揮的機會。第三幕描寫娜拉在醫院裏遇着罷工的領袖女工而更徹底了解了她的出路。但這一幕頗嫌不够强調，毛病在娜拉和女工底談話不够深入，鮮明，我以爲這是全劇底缺點，爲着篇幅，這裏不多說了。飾女友底王素女士，在這全戲裏都稱職。到農村去百合花飯店（上）  捷克ＪａｎＮｅｒｕｄａ原作仲足譯　　我想我那時也許會瘋狂了的。我身體中的每個纔維管活躍着，我的血己到了白熱化的程度。　　這是一個燠暖而漆黑的夏夜。幾天以來亢燥死沉的空氣，終於捲入黑雲裏面去了。在黄昏以前，一陣猛烈的風刮了起來，接着那聲勢洶洶的暴風爆發了牠的猛威，笨重的雨點砰　地下降，這樣的暴風間着狂雨一直到深夜。　　我正坐在斯特拉荷門附近的一個名呌「百合花」的旅館的拱廊下面。這是一個很小的旅館，但在當時一到了星期日，卻常有特别多的旅客，那大都是海陸軍的學生和伍長們，在大廳裏按着鋼琴的旋律跳舞作樂。　　今天正是星期。我獨自坐在拱廊下面靠窗的一桌。那隆隆的雷聲幾乎不斷地怒吼着，傾盆大雨打擊着我頭上的屋瓦，水像落細雨似地濺潑到地上，而大廳裏的鋼琴，似乎有了片時間隔的休息，常常重新爆發聲音。有時我從開着的門看看那旋轉着，笑着的一對，有時我也要向外注視那漆黑的花園。有時閃過一陣電掣的亮光，就可以望見園牆附近的廊端的人類白骨堆。這裏以前原是一所小葬地，這星期他們纔把骷髏掘了起來，預備把牠重埋别處的。那園地仍舊爬散着，而墳塜也都豁開着。　　不知怎的，我常不能在自己坐位裏久坐。我常要立了起來到那敝開着的大廳門旁站一會，這樣便得更親切地注視那跳舞的人們，每個時候，我給一位約摸十八歲的活潑女郎吸引了過去。苗條的身材，富於熱情的輪廓，長恰及頭的疏鬆的烏髮，温和的　圓臉以及亮晶晶的眼珠兒，她眞是一個美麗的女郎啊！她的眼睛迷惑了我。牠們像液體一樣的明凈，像那靜止的水面一樣的神秘，但双是這樣的撩人，立刻會使你想起這句話來··「烈火之就木，水之就海正和一個美麗眼睛的女郎饜足一個男子一樣的快！「　　她幾乎不停地舞着。但她早覺到我在注視她，當她跳過我站着的門首時，她常把眼睛緊釘着我，又當她跳到大廳的遠處時，我看見而且覺得她在每一次的轉身，總向我斜擲秋波。在這個晚上，我不曾見她和别人談話。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言互惠湯  光漢　　喧鬧過一時的通車問題，己經中日兩方努力折衝，得到圓滿解决，於昨七月一日起實行。據報載，當開始通車之際，各國僑民到站視察者甚衆，中西搭客有三百餘人，東車站頓呈空前熱烈狀况，誠盛事哩！豈料事出意外，當日直開瀋陽的特别快車，於午後一時半，過漢沽，將達茶淀時，車上突然發生猛烈爆炸，致車輛被毁，搭客死傷多人，又南滿路底車一列，由塘沽開行出站時，有農民抛磚石，擊破車窗玻璃多塊，亦美中的不足呢！然而此二事雖屬不幸，尚有一事却是値得欣慰的，聞由瀋陽開來的通車，其菜單中的牛尾湯，己改名爲互惠湯，以示通車爲中日兩國互惠的意思云。　　按牛尾湯這個菜名，是西洋人所取的，其粗俗不堪，一望而知，今日人把牠改爲互惠湯三字，實在精雅多了，可見日人的文化，比西洋人高出幾倍。不過，中國的孔子，素來是很看重名的，主張凡各事物，必須正名，因爲名不正，與實便不能相符。好在中日兩國都是十分尊重孔子學說的，現在不妨把這互惠湯一個名字，拿來看看有没有正。按互惠兩字，是彼此相惠的意思。中日通車，究竟是不是互惠呢？那末互惠湯這三字，要示通車爲中日兩國的互惠，這意思恐不能成立的。可見這名稱雅雖然雅，正却並不正。所以，爲求正名起見，互惠湯這一種菜名，倒不如另改爲惠日湯較爲適宜呢！或許有人要說，通車事情，互惠並没有錯，因爲據中日兩國的恊議，通車後所得的利益，是要平分的，難道利益平分還不算互惠不成？這倒也是很有理由的。　　其實通車是互惠，這亦不成爲問題，所成爲問題的，倒是以後一班搭客對於這一種菜名，不免要起生疏之感，這於營業方面，影響很大。所以我想提議，在互惠湯這一個我稱的下面，還是用括弧註明三字牛尾湯，這稱，不但可以挽救營業，於顧客也是很方便的。　　寫到這里，我忽然想到那些藏置炸彈，投擲磚石的人們，也許是反對這種互惠湯，所以才懷恨弄出這種惡作劇的吧？張又芬女士作品  張又芬無題  ＣＨ（一）　　話說一般神經過敏的人研究出來，馬路上的臭氣是有害公共衛生的。我以爲中國人現在所須要的訓練聞臭，尤其是上海人應該多聞些。要訓練到嗅臭不臭臭不爲害爲止！毒瓦司是臭不可擋的，而且窒死人的。西洋老鬼實在笨到出乎其類㧞乎其粹，他們面孔上罩了烏龜殼算是避免毒瓦司。眞如上海人所謂儂個猪頭三，太勿要面孔哉！阿拉上海中國地界常常臭得來一塌糊塗，受過年深日久訓練噶，毒瓦司來眞寫寫意意。到這時候，中國人揚眉吐氣，老鬼低首下心，呌上海人白　爷！钱人呼岳　爲岳爺爺，故所以岳飛是千古來的民族英雄。嗟乎，中國之没有民族英雄久矣；天道好還物極必返，今阿拉一躍而爲無數，爺爺，這個國恥正好雪得一乾二凈。况且一個國弄得來亂七八糟，糟得來巳經恥了，獨有上海人能够洗雪，乖乖上海人！　　（二）　　「麻將」，中國人可以向洋鬼子橋起大拇指來說··「這是中國的祖傳秘寳！」聽說美國人也一度請華僑敎過，但没有幾年。他們的麻將熱巳經退下去了，現在大有不再問津的趨勢，可惜　美國人是笨到使我們中原人只好站在旁邊唏唏地冷笑　他們　　玩　而無錢　　類球類有什麽好玩呢？牛馬一樣的奔跑，野蠻！俗氣！嘁！中原人的麻將多好坐着搓，文明！雅致！而且走上了賭運，朋友的洋錢鈔票，情情願願麥克麥克向我袋袋裏亂塞！總之，西洋老鬼不曉得在中原發明出來的小小骨牌里找東洋的精神文明，那是笨！我該從娘肚子爬出來就會搓，一直搓到嗚呼哀哉壽終正寢爲止。夜以繼日，日以繼夜的搓。進亦搓退亦搓，先天不之搓而搓，後天下之搓而搓，搓到一塌糊塗，搓到自己不相信自己。假使一旦不幸麻將在中原絶跡了，中華民國的精神文明也憍辫子了！　　（三）　　唱京調我們中原人也是都會，可見中原人是多才善藝；不會就是猪頭三·人而稱猪，其恥孰甚；猪之不足，從而三之，辱莫大焉！故所以非會不可。白天不妨哼，就是夜深人靜也可以高唱入雲；唱得搖頭擺尾，聲振林木，繞樑三日，把酣睡的人，不得不睜開惺忪眼睛苦着臉聽。况且唱戲可以得博士呢。梅大哥到美國去唱戲，不識中國文字，不懂中國語言的美國人，給他一個榮宗耀祖的博士。那末儘不妨模仿他啊，如果旦博了士榮歸，那眞博得你體無完膚，博你日月無光。在研究室里埋頭苦幹求來的博士，笨！蠢！平凡！在戲臺板上哼來的博士，巧！妙！稀罕！所以我提唱哼戲。　　（四）　　「男人拿出了錢玩女人，稱之曰嫖」。這定義是否凖確，等待三千年後考據家悉心靜氣去考正，我恕不嚕囌了。總之，嫖是人類特創，足以傲視他動物的把戲。他動物祇曉得性交，不曉得嫖；此動物所以笨，而我們人類所以聰明了。然天下事情往往不能稱心如意，吾現在用社會學家的口吻來說··「性慾衝動形成嫖，嫖形成花柳病；兩者是秉有必然性和連環性。」嫖是樂，花柳病是苦，矛盾！不要緊！打針！「六零六」「九一四」不是給無錫的泥公泥婆用的，是專給萬物之靈脊推動物的人應便享受的，吾曾經用心之至研究過，「六零六」「九一四」固好，然而要化錢。嫖而染上了花柳病資格還嫩，頂好要愈病愈嫖，再接再厲，厲到染不上花柳病爲止。那時花柳病的醫生，自悔錯選職業，一個個自動投浦懸梁　，這時候世界更文明，更大同。報紙雜誌上，都畫着雪白滾胖的精赤文人，　招手呌你和她去睡覺。　　　　　　　　　　　　　好媽的了，耐性等着罷，終有這一天！扇  敬嘉　　自己有把紙摺扇，巳經陪着我過了二個夏季了。骨子是檀香的。正面畫着一幅簡單的山水，背面寫着半篇滕王閣序，這都是同學月君一手包辦的。　　一看見這把扇子，我就會想到Ａ君。　　Ａ君是我初中裏的同學，高高的身材，怪雄壯的，不大愛說話。寫得一筆好字，而且也會畫。　　他有爽直的性格，慷慨激昻的情緒，換句話說，他是不大懂得做人的藝術的，他老是在直綫上進行，因此他老吃虧。　　初中畢業那一學期，學生會主席Ｃ君没得同學同意，私自向學校當局把各人儲費提出一元來，據說是辦刋物。但結果，一百五十幾塊錢都被Ｃ君私用了，這消息使有君忿怒起來，他說··「爲什麽我們的錢可以由Ｃ君呑用呢？」我們的權利不願意被人剥削啊！於是他做了宣言公告同學，要喚醒同學不要被人朦蔽。Ｃ君當然不肯罷休，也出了宣言說··「同學們，不要被人利用啊！他們在想獲得地位啊！」同學們的信仰都被Ｃ君得到了，Ａ君得到了失望。這件事Ａ君氣得一天没吃飯，他眞料不到好心好意會遭到這種報復。　　畢業後，他没升學，就在一家銀行裏當練習生。他依舊不知道做人，性格依舊是率直的。他不懂得怎樣迎逢總經理們，他不懂得怎樣聯絡同事們，因此他得不到任何人的憐愛。雖然有人忠告他敎導他做人的藝術，但是他總是搖搖頭說··「用不着。我不做虧心事！我不懈怠我的職務；我用不着那些卑鄙的手叚！」　　因此他招了人的忌。結果他被辭退了。後來又進了另一家百貨公司做小職員。性格依舊不改。結果又辭退了。從此後没有人再給他薦職業，同時他也不請求人替他找事幹。他靠着自己雄壯的身材進了工廠。他曾經有一次打開了工頭的頭部，被送進了捕房。最後聽說他被幾個流氓打傷，死在醫院裏。　　「好人做不得的。」這Ａ君臨終的話。他至死還不知道做人的藝術。　　的確，他太傻了！他只知道做直的鐵軌，他不會做　的　輪！　　我没有向他要過照片，他給我的　　就是這把扇子的字畫。和他的</p>

<h3>The Passenger Volume of the Ping-Shen Train Decreases Greatly; The Number of Japanese and Puppet Troops Increases in the War Zone</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong's intention to resign is firm, and he has ordered his family to prepare their luggage. He will leave Beiping with his family within days, seemingly heading to Lushan as a summer resort. After the puppet Fengshan Railway Bureau Chief, Ota Hisakazu, arrived in Beiping yesterday morning, he visited Yin Tong. Yin told him that he would not hold the position or interfere with its administration. After a brief conversation, Ota left. Ota visited again this morning, but Yin did not meet with him. Ota left Beiping after his departure. Yin said that Ota's visit was of a general nature. The war zone issues are currently being discussed and negotiated by the two commissioners, Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming. Because he has already requested resignation, he did not participate. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today is the fourth day since the Ping-Shen train reopened. Due to the tragedy in Chadian, passengers are cautious. Therefore, the number of people leaving the border has gradually decreased. This morning, the special express train departing from Ping sold a total of 227 third-class tickets, but only 57 people left the border. This is decreasing day by day compared to yesterday and the day before yesterday. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The fourth Ping-Shen train departed on time on the 4th, but the number of passengers decreased greatly. A total of 227 tickets were sold, of which 55 were leaving the border. General observation suggests that this is due to the impact of the bombing of the train. After Yin Tong resigned, the Ministry of Railways sent a telegram of consolation on the 3rd. Yin's intention to resign remains firm. Whether compensation should be given to the deceased passengers has been submitted to the Railway Bureau for the Ministry of Railways to review. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong said that although thorough considerations were given to security aspects before the reopening of the Ping-Shen train, the unfortunate incident in Chadian still occurred, which is regrettable. Because the responsibility is critical and the situation is difficult, he decided to resign and will leave Beiping in the coming days to avoid further trouble. The Japanese side's attitude towards this incident is stable, without any expressions or proposals. Rumors that they had requested an increase in security personnel and joint cargo transportation are not true. Iwai was in Beiping yesterday for a brief meeting, but he did not come because of the train bombing incident. Ota is still in Tianjin. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong, the director of the Bei-Ning Bureau, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Railways to resign in remorse due to the bombing incident on the first Ping-Shen train. Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways replied that the resignation should not be discussed. The bombing of the train should still be thoroughly investigated by the director to clarify the truth. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu stated that the Ministry of Railways has received detailed reports from Yin Tong, Xu Wenguo, and Zheng Baozhao regarding the Ping-Shen train bombing case, and is providing compensation to the injured and deceased. However, the cause of the bombing has not yet been fully determined. The Ministry of Railways has ordered the bureau to conduct a detailed investigation to protect the safety of passengers. After this incident occurred, Yin and others telegraphed the ministry to resign in remorse. The telegram was very brief, stating only that they had failed in their duties and should be punished. The Ministry of Railways replied on the 4th, instructing them to strengthen protection and that the requested resignation should not be discussed. Currently, Yin and others have not sent any further telegrams requesting resignation. Reports on railway affairs and telegrams continue to arrive from time to time, so it is expected that Yin and others will not insist on resigning after being persuaded to stay. Gu believes that the security forces on the railway are sufficient to maintain order, and stated that there will be no major impact on passengers and the railway's operations in the future. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways considers this matter to be a regular issue, so he did not report it to the Executive Yuan yesterday, nor did he submit a report to the Central Political Council today. It is only necessary for the railway to pay attention to safety aspects in the future to prevent similar incidents from happening again. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese troops stationed in the area around Saheqiao and the Imperial Tombs were under special martial law because of the bombing of the Ping-Shen train at Chadian Station. At the same time, 100 Japanese and puppet troops each were dispatched from outside the passes and stationed in nearby areas. In addition, the Japanese army unit stationed in Sahe announced that anti-Japanese and anti-Manchu leaflets had been discovered in Zunhua County. Therefore, starting from the 2nd, major roads into the area have been guarded by large armies. Heavy artillery was set up at Xifengkou to inspect pedestrians. The Malanlue Japanese airport, which originally had 29 aircraft stationed, has recently added 10 aircraft, which fly to various locations for reconnaissance every day. In addition, household registration inspections are particularly strict, and those with suspicious behavior are expelled or charged with anti-Japanese and anti-Manchu crimes, with countless victims.

<h3>The Qinhuangdao Customs Commissioner Prepares to Establish Customs Posts on the Great Wall</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of establishing customs posts on the Great Wall, the authorities have ordered the Qinhuangdao Customs Commissioner to prepare to establish customs posts. A main checkpoint will be established at Shanhaiguan, and seven sub-checkpoints will be established at various passes along the Great Wall to collect import and export customs duties between North China and the puppet territory. The tax rate will be in accordance with the revised new customs tariff announced by the government the other day. It is heard that Badarson, the Qinhuangdao Customs Commissioner, is in contact with Iwai, the head of the Japanese Kwantung Army's Yuguan Special Affairs Organ, regarding the establishment of customs posts and tax collection. This will be realized soon after the opening of the train line, because a large number of goods will inevitably enter the country after the train line opens. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Takeover of Malan峪 are Underway</h3>
<p>The Management Committee of the Eastern Tombs is Expanded</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng will personally participate in the takeover of Malan峪. It has been decided to expand the organization of the management committee for the Eastern Tombs. The Hebei Provincial Government, the Jiji-Miyun Commissioner's Office, the Xinglong County Government, and the Qing Dynasty Prince's family will participate and be jointly responsible for the actual management. Currently, there are approximately 12,000 male and female descendants of the Qing Dynasty Eight Banners stationed at the Eastern Tombs. They are lazy and greedy, and many of the mausoleum buildings have been destroyed. The Jiji-Miyun Commissioner's Office plans to send a squadron of security guards of about 100 people to protect the tombs after the takeover. Repairs will be made to the damaged areas.

<h3>Central Political Council</h3>
<p>Adopts the National Revenue and Expenditure General Budget</p>
<p>Three Counties of Fujian Province are Approved to be Under the Jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province</p>

<h3>The Water Level of the Luokou River Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The weather was clear on the 4th. The water level of the Yellow River at Luokou continued to rise by seven fen. Emergency repairs are underway downstream, so there is no need to worry. Although the construction of the Zhukou project from Liuzhuang upstream is dangerous, the water is not high, and there is no risk of flooding. Li Shengcun has raised enough materials, so there should be no accidents this year. However, Huanghuasi is located in a river bend, and if the water rises too high, it is uncertain whether there will be any danger. Tang Jianfen, the chief of the engineering section of the River Bureau, went downstream to inspect on the afternoon of the 4th. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Control Yuan's Supervisory Districts Will Establish Nine Districts First</h3>
<p>The Candidates for Supervisory Envoys are Determined</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan's Supervisory Districts will establish nine districts first. The candidates for Supervisory Envoys have been internally determined: First District (Jiangsu) - Ye Chucang; Second District (Hebei) - Zhang Ji; Third District (Anhui and Jiangxi) - Chen Lifu; Seventh District (Henan and Shandong) - Ding Weifen; Twelfth District (Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan) - Liu Shouzhong; Thirteenth District (Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai) - Zhou Zhenlin. The Executive Yuan's original monthly funding was 75,000 yuan, and even with efforts to economize, it was still insufficient. Therefore, it was proposed to increase the budget to over 100,000 yuan in the 23rd year. After review by the Audit Department, considering the national financial difficulties and taking into account the actual situation of the Yuan, it was approved to be 83,000 yuan, an increase of 8,000 yuan per month.

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Plans to Reduce the Number of Inland Customs Offices</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has been conducting detailed research on reorganizing customs affairs through the relevant authorities such as the Customs Administration and the Inspector General of Customs. It is expected that there will be a major reform plan underway. It is understood that it has been proposed that customs offices be established primarily along the coast. For example, the Jianghai, Jinhai, Yuehai, Minhai, Jiaohai, Zhehai, Ouhai, Xiamen, and Qionghai Customs offices, which handle the import and export of coastal steamships, will all collect taxes and duties. Furthermore, it has long been stipulated that foreign ships cannot arbitrarily navigate inland rivers. Subsequently, foreign ships must report and pay taxes upon entry, otherwise they will be penalized as smuggling. As for the Yangtze River and inland customs offices, such as Jianghan, Wuhu, Changyue, Chongqing, Zhenjiang, Jiujiang, Yichang, Jinling, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Jingsha Customs offices, the Ministry of Finance believes that it is not necessary to waste public funds. It is only necessary to increase the anti-smuggling forces of the coastal customs offices to prevent tax evaders from importing goods into the interior. The inland personnel affairs can be merged into the tax bureau of the same nature, which can save part of the inland customs expenses every year. If it is considered absolutely necessary in reality, one or two offices may be retained. This plan is now gradually becoming concrete, but it still needs to go through detailed preparation before it can be realized. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) All major trading ports in our country have customs offices. In the Yangtze River area, there are Jianghai, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Jinling, Wuhu, and Jianghan Customs offices. Foreign goods imported through Shanghai and Hankou are subject to import tariffs at the customs office, as well as wharf fees. In general, merchants often evade wharf fees by paying taxes at the Suzhou Customs office instead of the Jianghai Customs office, where the tax rate is higher. In order to reorganize the national customs affairs and ensure equal tax payment for imported goods, the financial authorities plan to reduce the number of inland customs offices, such as only retaining Jianghai and Jianghan Customs offices in the Yangtze River area.

<h3>Yu Jishi Discusses the Situation of Bandit Suppression on the Border of Zhejiang</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Yu Jishi, the director of the Security Department, returned to Hangzhou from Yushan and issued a statement on the recent situation of bandit suppression on the border of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, saying that the bandits' attacks on Kaihua and Suian were because when the various units of the headquarters were attacking Zheng Rongfang, the bandits' lair was shaken. In order to draw the fire from the base, they dispatched about 500 people from their so-called Shangrao Independent Regiment, sneaking in through the mountains between Yukeng and Yinlingshan, attempting to disrupt Kaihua Huabu through Youxikou. Our army rushed to encircle and suppress them, and the bandits fled from Majin Town to Suian territory, where they were also chased and intercepted by us. The bandits then detoured through Sanlili Gang in Wuyuan, and fled back to the jurisdiction of Dexing Linyu between Qingbanqiao and Jiudu. After this severe suppression, the bandits will not dare to attack again. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Bans Prize-Linked Savings</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Legislative Member Ma Yinchu proposed banning prize-linked savings at the second financial conference, which was passed. The Ministry of Finance is now planning the implementation of this case and stated that it intends to gradually ban prize-linked savings before the promulgation of the Savings Bank Implementation Law. This is because although the Banking Law has been promulgated, the Bank Implementation Law has not yet been promulgated and has already been implemented. However, the China-French and Universal Savings Associations have been around for a long time and have absorbed a large amount of savings. In order to avoid affecting savers, it was decided to first find a way to check the actual amount of savings and reserves of the two associations, and then stop the two associations from accepting new savers. However, before implementing this matter, it is still necessary to consult with the relevant ministries and commissions. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>New Tariff and the Cotton Textile Industry</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The recently revised customs import tariff has been implemented since the 3rd of this month. It is said that in this revision of the tariff, the Ministry of Finance authorities carefully considered the importance of different items. For example, the increase in the tax rate on luxury goods serves both to enrich the national treasury and to encourage frugality. Such measures are naturally praised by discerning individuals. However, comparing the content of the tariff announced on May 22nd of last year with the current new tariff, the most noteworthy aspect lies not in the luxury goods consumed by a minority of people, but in the essential goods imported in large quantities, such as cotton yarn, cloth, marine products, sugar, and paper. Leaving other items aside, let us focus solely on textiles. It is still remembered that in May of last year, when the three-year term of the Sino-Japanese tariff reciprocity agreement of the 19th year of the Republic of China was expiring, the financial authorities of our country, considering that the tariffs paid on the 33 types of Japanese imported cotton textiles after the conclusion of the agreement were generally reduced by 30 to 40 percent compared to the prevailing import tariff rates at the time, essentially granting them extra protection, decided to raise the import tax on textiles to support the domestic cotton textile industry. After this tariff increase, the impact was twofold: an increase in national tax revenue and a blow to Japanese cotton imports. As a result, our own struggling cotton textile industry occupied a relatively advantageous position. However, the advantage that Japanese cotton goods had relied on after the expiration of the reciprocity agreement was lost, but Japanese cotton mills in our treaty ports actively expanded, and illegal tax evasion of cotton textiles also emerged. It is said that in this one year, the smuggling of textiles has already caused significant losses to the national treasury. If this continues, the amount will only become more alarming. This time, the tariff on cotton textiles has been reduced, while the tariff on raw cotton has been increased. It is impossible to predict how many smuggling incidents will be prevented as a result, but it can be asserted that it will not be enough to limit the expansion of Japanese cotton mills in China. The financial authorities hired experts to study the revision of the tariff for quite some time, and the severity of the new tariff must also be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan before being submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. The procedures involved are complex, and cannot be compared to those of someone who writes hastily. However, although the new tariff has been announced, it does not fully meet expectations, and Chinese factories have already expressed dissatisfaction. This cannot but be regrettable.</p>
<p>National tariffs are divided into fiscal tariffs and protective tariffs, based on the purpose of taxation. Fiscal tariffs are intended to increase national treasury revenue. Protective tariffs are intended to support domestic industries. However, if the financial authorities use the reason of preventing smuggling to reduce the import tax on cotton textiles, I fear that it is not in line with the principles of either fiscal tariffs or protective tariffs. Why? Because after the tax reduction, the national treasury revenue and the future of the domestic cotton textile industry will suffer a major blow, and whether smuggling can be stopped is still unknown.</p>
<p>Today, world powers are using high tariff barriers as weapons in trade wars. How can our industrially backward country escape this exception? In recent years, foreign goods have been dumped into our markets almost without exception. Even if we cannot soar in the world's commercial arena, we should at least not relinquish purely defensive weapons. The textile industry is our most developed industry, which has already been recognized by the Chinese people. However, after decades of struggling, it is still inevitably in a difficult situation. After the implementation of this new tariff, the dumping of foreign goods will inevitably intensify, and business will become more difficult. Even with the assistance of the financial sector, it may be difficult to sustain. Once the textile industry, a giant of the real economy, is unable to survive, how can other industries alone prosper? What is now hoped from the government is that it will focus on rescuing the national economy and give serious consideration to the newly promulgated tariff. In particular, the cotton textile part should continue the original intention of the tariff revision in May of last year, and impose relative restrictions on foreign textiles. Then, our dying domestic cotton textile industry may have a chance to survive.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Starts to Reorganize Railway Debts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the details of the Ministry of Railways' reorganization of debts, there is much that is unclear to the outside world. According to a statement from a person in charge of the Ministry, the total amount of railway debts owed by the Ministry of Railways as of now, including domestic and foreign debts and interest, is approximately 100 million yuan. The so-called Nishihara Loans are not included. This refers specifically to those debts of the Ministry of Railways that are on record. The Ministry of Railways is currently reorganizing these loans. Building railways with borrowed money is unavoidable in Europe and the United States. What is hoped is that the reorganization will be effective and the debts will be cleared as soon as possible, so that subsequent operations will be for the development of transportation and the benefit of the country. If the reorganization is delayed, the debts will be difficult to repay, and railway administration will be difficult to develop. Even subsequent construction will be affected by the debt credibility. Currently, the Ministry of Railways has completed the reorganization of approximately 10 million yuan, mainly by (1) reducing the originally agreed interest rate. For example, those with an original monthly interest rate of nine li have been reduced to six li. (2) Regardless of whether they are domestic or foreign debts, all those on record with the Ministry of Railways will be dealt with. (3) Preliminary reorganization of material debts. Therefore, the 10 million yuan that has already been reorganized is all related to material loans. As for the Nishihara Loans, the Ministry of Railways has no intention of reorganizing them, because these loans were borrowed during the Anfu Clique era for other purposes, so there is no record of them. In the old Ministry of Communications, these loans could be said to be unrelated to the Ministry of Railways, let alone reorganized. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Central Railway Station is in the Planning Stage</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways believes that the construction of the Central Road in the capital has been completed, and it has been decided that the Jinwu Railway will be connected to the Jinhu Railway in February of next year. Therefore, the construction of the Central Railway Station is urgently needed. The relevant parties have consulted and decided to plan and build it immediately. The plan is to temporarily not expand the scope of the Central Railway Station, because the Xiaguan Railway Station is relatively complete, and the Hepingmen Railway Station will also remain. The construction of the Central Railway Station is to facilitate the connection of the Jinwu Railway. Whether special express trains will stop there has not yet been decided. As for the start date, it has been decided to start in the autumn of this year and complete it by the end of the year, so that it can be connected to the Jinwu Railway in February of next year. The budget for this project is also quite simple, roughly equal to the ordinary cost of building an ordinary railway station. (Dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Decides to Repair the Pinghan Railway</h3>

It is estimated that the repair of the Yellow River Railway Bridge will take four years to complete. The Ministry of Railways believes that if it is delayed any longer, it may be impossible to prevent the old road from being obstructed within four years. Therefore, it has now divided the steps and plans to start repairing item by item within this year. (Dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<p>German Cabinet Resolves to Revise the Law on the Unity of Party and State</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff of the Party Army Does Not Have to Be a Cabinet Member</h3>
<p>Hitler Visits President Hindenburg</p>
<p>Goering Replaces Papen as Deputy Chancellor</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Hitler government is still pursuing a policy of slaughter. From the failure of the coup last Saturday to Tuesday night, a total of 46 people were executed, mostly stormtrooper leaders and squad leaders. After a cursory trial by a military tribunal, they were shot. The official list of victims has not yet been announced, but Associated Press reporters have learned from reliable sources that Munich Catholic leader Von Galen is also among the victims. It is believed here that after the truth about Von Galen's death becomes clear, it will further increase the tension between the Hitler government and the Roman Curia, because the relationship between the Curia and the Hitler government has already been fundamentally tense since the death of Berlin Catholic movement leader Klausener. The Roman Curia has not concealed the fact that Klausener's death was a murder and not a suicide. According to the Associated Press, one of the victims named Brühler was a confidant of former Chancellor Schleicher. General Goering will succeed Papen as Deputy Chancellor. Papen resigned again this morning. Chancellor Hitler took a plane to Neudeck at 3:00 pm today to ask President Hindenburg to approve Papen's resignation. It is learned that a cabinet meeting will still be held tomorrow, and General Goering may be promoted to Deputy Chancellor at this meeting. The cabinet meeting this morning decided to abolish the law that the Chief of Staff of the Stormtroopers must be a cabinet member. This law is what makes the party and the state one.

<p>(Tokyo) It was奏淸 that Navy Admiral Okada Keisuke was appointed as the総任内閣の総揆. Because 1935-1936 is an international crisis, it is being considered so that the relationship between the government and the military can be harmonized. Prime Minister Okada's new cabinet policy aims for a unified national cabinet, which is understood to be following the policies of the Saito cabinet. (Dentsu News Agency Telegram on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Internal Worries Are Not Over</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph's Berlin dispatch stated that the German bloodbath has failed to extinguish the flames of revolution. The reporter saw a leaflet issued by the Stormtrooper Revolutionary Committee, which stated, "Although our leaders have passed away, the work of our revolution continues. The leaders who have been shot understood the ideals of the Stormtroopers, but those who remain do not fully understand this meaning. Hitler will become a puppet of the restorationists and industrialists, who want to destroy the workers." The Daily Express's diplomatic correspondent stated that he learned from important sources that President Hindenburg was forced to sign congratulatory telegrams to Hitler and General Goering. If the German president refused to issue them, Deputy Chancellor Papen and other friends of the president would be put to death. The newspaper also said that there is a rumor that Hitler, on the advice of Mussolini, has decided to restore the German throne, but this statement cannot be easily believed.

<h3>The Rightward Shift of the German Political Situation</h3>
<p>(Berlin) It is generally expected that the policies of the National Socialist Party will shift towards the right wing. This can be seen from the shooting of Röhm and other extreme elements of the National Socialist Party. If the National Defense Force does not receive a satisfactory guarantee from the government regarding the views of the aristocrats and industrialists, it may not immediately support the government. However, for this reason, the humiliation of Deputy Chancellor Papen is even more surprising. Hitler has probably realized that the people around him made a mistake in making Papen angrily withdraw from the cabinet. As for the assassination of former Chancellor Schleicher, it did not have any impact on his colleagues, because Schleicher was not loved and was regarded as a selfish conspirator. One more thing to note is that, despite all the shocking news, this incident has nothing to do with the German royal family. It was previously said that the German Crown Prince's adjutant, Modler, was killed, but according to today's news, he is safe and sound and is performing his duties as usual.

<h3>Hitler Takes Strict Precautions</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler is still the most closely guarded person in the world today, because he is afraid that someone will harm him. Silesian Governor Dr. Brückler said in a speech in Ratibor that when the time is ripe, he would not hesitate to execute Catholic priests with the bullets of the National Defense Force. The Catholics in Berlin were very disturbed when they heard this. This kind of speech seems to make the relationship between Germany and the Pope more serious.</p>
<p>Tonight, rumors here are that Deputy Chancellor Papen has resigned, and Hitler has gone to Neudeck to personally report the details of the recent incident to the President. Mr. Hitler tried hard to persuade Mr. Papen to stay at the cabinet meeting today, but Mr. Papen firmly refused to stay, pleading to leave first. Mr. Hitler was greatly surprised. Although Mr. Papen's fate has not been officially announced, it is generally expected that his letter of resignation will be published at any time. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Results of Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Recognizing Hitler's Actions as Legal</p>
<p>(Berlin) An important cabinet meeting was held this afternoon. After the meeting, the German News Agency issued a communiqué stating that the Prime Minister first stated at the cabinet meeting the conspiracy to endanger national security and the process of punishing it. Mr. Hitler said that this matter must be acted upon quickly, otherwise countless lives will be affected. Defense Minister General von Blomberg, on behalf of the cabinet and the military, thanked the Prime Minister, saying that the German people were spared from internal strife thanks to Mr. Hitler's firm and courageous actions. The cabinet then passed the National Justifiable Defense Act, which is retroactive and contains only one article, which states that "the various measures taken on June 30, July 1, and July 2 of this year to punish treason are legitimate measures to defend the country." Justice Minister Guertner said that the measures taken to deal with treason were not only legitimate, but also the duty of the authorities. The cabinet then passed a law to amend the law on the unity of party and state. According to the law on the unity of party and state, the chairman of the Central Committee of the National Socialist Party, Hess, and the deceased Röhm were both ministers without portfolio. After this amendment, the Chief of Staff of the Party Army does not necessarily have to be a cabinet member of the central government. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since the coup on June 30, the general public has been unclear about the political situation. Since the cabinet meeting issued a communiqué today, everyone has become clear. In the communiqué, General von Blomberg, representing the National Defense Force, thanked Hitler, saying that his swift action saved Germany from internal strife. For the past three days, it has been an unfathomable mystery whether Germany is a dictatorship of the National Socialist Party or a military dictatorship. Now that we have heard General von Blomberg's words, it can be determined that the real power in Germany is in the hands of the military. From now on, Hitler will only exercise power in the name of the military. The current political system in Germany is indeed a military dictatorship. We can also say that Hitler's current position in relation to the military is equal to the subordinate position of the Weimar Republic to the military. Röhm is dead, and his Stormtroopers, even if they are not completely eliminated, will be of little importance in German politics in the future. Hitler has been able to hold power until today entirely because of the power of National Socialism. Now that the Stormtroopers are eliminated, National Socialism has also lost its main factor. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The cabinet held a special meeting this afternoon. Prime Minister Hitler gave a detailed report on the incident. The cabinet approved the emergency national defense law, the last clause of which stipulates that "the measures taken on June 30, July 1 and 2, 1934 to quell incidents endangering the country are hereby declared to be legitimate actions for national self-defense." Justice Minister Guertner declared that this self-defense plan was not only legal, but also the responsibility of politicians. (National Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Prime Minister Hitler arrived in Neudeck to visit President Hindenburg, and returned to Berlin by plane at 1:25 pm today. (National Telegram on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Deputy Chancellor Expresses Opinion</h3>
<p>Salzburg Deputy Chancellor Prince Starhemberg delivered a speech on the German incident, stating, "We Austrians are closely related to the German people, but we absolutely do not approve of the German authorities' tarnishing of the German nation's reputation. The killing of Stormtrooper leader Röhm and his comrades is not enough to prove the legitimacy of the German authorities' attitude. We cannot remain indifferent to the German people's reputation being tarnished by their authorities, and to the German people being regarded as a barbaric nation. German gazettes openly publish private scandals, which is absolutely unprecedented in official documents written in German. In view of the German incident, we feel even more that Austria's independence must be preserved. We must not be affected by the risk of the Third Reich's demise. In short, National Socialism is a German-style Bolshevism, and its barbarity is quite comparable. What we Austrians want to show the world is that the Austrian German race will never degenerate like this," and so on. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Russian Reporter's Commentary</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The newspaper Izvestia published an article by Radek commenting on the development of the German incident, which stated, "German fascism has completed a decisive step in losing the support of the petty bourgeoisie masses. The fascist leaders have made a sharp turn and have obeyed monopoly capital, beheading the main mass organizations of the petty bourgeoisie. However, we would be greatly mistaken if we thought that the German bourgeoisie had decided to completely expel Hitler. On the contrary, they still need Hitler. However, the main trend of development is to transform the German fascist government into a government of German monopoly capital and landlords, whose main supporters are the National Guard and the police, rather than the petty bourgeois masses. The events of June 30 have greatly destroyed the prestige of fascist Germany abroad, and at the same time prove that the social contradictions within this single party are full of tension and have broken the party from within. The occurrence of these events is because there are still millions of workers in Germany who stand outside the party, have not succumbed to fascism, and only the proletarian communist vanguard is actively uniting the entire proletarian masses to fight against fascism. Fascism deeply feels the hatred of this mass, so it wants to fill the organizational loopholes as much as possible to prevent the larva of revolution from breaking out from this. The events of June 30 have great historical significance, and the rapid development of the German situation is far beyond what we can imagine." (TASS dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Germany Prepares for Trade War</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the German cabinet passed a bill authorizing the government to implement economic retaliation measures against countries that adopt compulsory plans that are unfavorable to Germany. At the same time, it also passed 20 other bills related to forests and hunting, and allowed parents with five or more children to be exempt from income tax. German economic retaliation was triggered by the establishment of a clearing house by Britain, which was due to Germany's suspension of debt payments for six months. Therefore, the clearing of German-British goods was carried out to show retaliation. German debts have been gradually suspended starting today. At the same time, Germany has passed another bill allowing for the immediate collection of surtaxes when necessary. The report on the situation of the German National Bank at the end of June showed that the reserves of cash and currency had slightly increased compared to the previous period, which was the first time since the National Socialist Party came to power on January 30, 1933.

<h3>France Unifies Colonies</h3>
<p>(Paris) The administration of the French tropical region in Africa was greatly reformed today. The three current governors of the colonies have all been dismissed in order to implement a centralized system. From now on, the federal system will be abolished, and all colonies will be merged into one administrative region, all under the rule of one governor. (National Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Saionji Recommends Okada Keisuke to Form a Cabinet</h3>
<p>The New Prime Minister Has Served as Minister of the Navy Twice</p>
<p>And Has Good Relations with Political Parties</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the meeting of senior statesmen in the palace, it was decided that Saito's cabinet's Minister of the Navy Okada Keisuke would be the successor cabinet. Saionji immediately visited the Emperor to report the results of the meeting, and the Emperor issued an imperial command to Okada Keisuke to form a cabinet. (Rengo News Agency Telegram on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Admiral Okada, who was summoned to the palace at 2:00 pm, retired after receiving the imperial command to organize the successor cabinet. At 2:20 pm, he immediately set up the cabinet formation office at the Prime Minister's official residence and began forming the cabinet. (Dentsu Telegram on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Admiral Okada, who was ordered to organize the successor cabinet, served as Minister of the Navy in the Tanaka Cabinet in 1927. He later served as Minister of the Navy in the Saito Cabinet and resigned after the truth of the May 15th Incident became clear. He is now retired and has resigned from all positions. The Admiral is from Fukui and has relatively good relations with political parties. Even in this difficult political situation, he is very close to all parties and it will be easy to form a cabinet. (Dentsu Telegram on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Cabinet Member List Prediction</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Judging from the current situation, with the exception of the military ministers who have been decided to retain their positions, the following is a rough assessment of other cabinet members: Minister of Foreign Affairs Koki Hirota (to remain in office), Minister of Interior Takenji Tokonami, or Fumio Goto, Minister of Justice Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, or Chief Prosecutor Hayashi, Minister of Education Hidejiro Nagata, or Hideo Kodama, Minister of Finance Eiichi Baba, or Eigo Fukai, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Fumio Goto (to remain in office), Minister of Commerce and Industry: undecided, Minister of Communications Keisuke Mochizuki, Minister of Railways Chuji Machida, Minister of Colonial Affairs Zenjiro Horigiri, or Genji Matsuda. (Fourth Daily Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Army and Navy Ministers to Remain in Office</p>
<p>(Tokyo) General Okada, who has started forming his cabinet, earnestly requested Army Minister Hayashi and Navy Minister Osumi to remain in their positions. As a result, both ministers have agreed and will continue to serve as cabinet members in the new government. (Fourth Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Within the army, there is dissatisfaction towards General Okada because of his association with the London Naval Treaty faction. It is believed that requesting the Navy Minister to stay on would be difficult, and may not be successful. Even if the cabinet is formed, it is not expected to last long. However, Army Minister Hayashi has already decided to remain in the new cabinet. (Fourth Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The navy believes that 1935 and 1936 will be years of international crisis, and hopes for the formation of a cabinet united nationally. Therefore, the Navy welcomes the imperial mandate given to General Okada, believing that he, like the Saito cabinet, has a full understanding of naval issues. While some hope for a more powerful cabinet and express dissatisfaction, they recognize the need to overcome this extraordinary time with unity. Therefore, they have decided to support and encourage. (Fourth Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>Keisuke Okada's Personal History</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The following is the personal history of Keisuke Okada, who received the imperial mandate to form a cabinet today. Okada is from Fukui Prefecture and was born in Meiji 1. In Meiji 16, he succeeded his father, Kitota Okada, as head of the household. In Meiji 22, he graduated from the Naval Academy. The following year, he was commissioned as a naval ensign. In Taisho 13, he was appointed as a naval admiral. During this time, he served as an instructor at the Naval War College, executive officer of the Kasuga, Chitose, Yaeyama, and Asahi warships, chief of naval mine technology, captain of the Kasuga and Kashima warships, chief of the armament department of the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, commander of the First and Third Mine Squadrons of the Second Fleet, chief of the Second and Third Departments of the Naval Technical Headquarters, chief of the Personnel Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, director of the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, chief of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, chief of the Naval Construction Headquarters, vice-minister of the Navy, military councilor, commander-in-chief of the First Fleet, commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, and commander-in-chief of the Yokosuka Naval Base.

<p>The New Prime Minister Resembles an Old Gentryman</p>
<p>Known as a Devoted Son and Considers Wine His Wife</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The new Prime Minister, General Okada, resides in Kankyo-cho, behind Shinjuku, in a very simple house. His lifestyle is like that of a gentleman from the countryside, and his nature is simple and honest. Since losing his wife in Showa 3, he has considered wine as his wife. His third daughter, Miss Kimiko, married Lieutenant Suzuki of the Kasumigaura Naval Air Group on May 6th of this year. His son, Lieutenant Sadaemoto, is serving on the Shirayuki warship and recently got married. The General is known as a devoted son and has a close friendship with Lieutenant Commander Hirose. (Fourth Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>Attitude of Political Parties</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The leaders of the Seiyukai speculate that General Okada will form a purely bureaucratic cabinet, not based on political parties. Therefore, the Seiyukai, adhering to its policy of principle-based judgment, will not assist the Okada cabinet. If there is negotiation for party representatives to enter the cabinet, the party will not send representatives. If individual party members are approached and agree to enter the cabinet, they will be advised to leave the party. It is said that they have reached a consensus to not have any relationship with the new cabinet. However, within the party, there are those who believe that if the new Prime Minister Okada respects political parties and intends to form a national unity cabinet based on political parties, it may be acceptable to engage in negotiations for entering the cabinet and supporting it. Before a party resolution is decided, conflict may be unavoidable, or even lead to a major dispute. Therefore, the future is quite noteworthy. (Fourth Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Minseito's observation is that the new Prime Minister, General Okada, will request assistance from President Wakatsuki within the next day or two. At that time, President Wakatsuki and the executives will consult and decide whether to support the new cabinet. It is also predicted that among Chuji Machida, Takugo Kawasaki, and Keiichiro Soeda, someone will enter the cabinet. If Interior Minister Yamamoto remains in office, then one of the above three may enter the cabinet. (Fourth Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tense Relations with Abyssinia</p>
<p>(London) The "Morning Post" quoted a dispatch from Rome as saying that relations between Italy and the East African country of Abyssinia are strained and have reached a critical point. Abyssinia is obligated under treaty to treat Italy as a most favored nation, but the Abyssinian government has not fulfilled this obligation, and most of its trade is inclined towards other countries, especially Japan. Furthermore, it harbors a hostile attitude towards Italy, openly importing arms and weapons from Europe and the Far East, while training its citizens militarily. Italy said that in the hope of reaching a reconciliation, negotiations are now underway. (Fourth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Death of Physicist Marie Curie</p>
<p>Valence - Marie Curie, who co-discovered radium with her husband, passed away here today at the age of sixty-seven. Madam Curie enjoyed great fame in the global scientific community, yet she remained secluded and dedicated to her work. All the prizes she received were used for her chemical research or donated to hospitals exploring cancer treatments. Despite her reputation, she could have enjoyed a luxurious life, but she continued to live frugally and quietly on her salary as a professor at the University of Paris. Although she discovered radium, she never possessed even a small amount of it. It wasn't until 1921 that American women raised £20,000 to purchase one gram of radium for her to use in her experiments. She donated this gift to hospitals and received an annual rental income of £700 to support the Warsaw Cancer Hospital in Poland. As a result, in 1929, American friends purchased and gifted her radium again and invited her to visit the United States. President Hoover will invite her to the White House for a discussion and present her with a check for £10,000 from the American Cancer Research Association. Madam Curie still requested that this money be used to purchase one gram of radium. After returning to France from her trip, she continued her work at the Paris Chemical Laboratory. Madam Curie and her husband jointly won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903, and she won it again alone in 1911, both of which were used for research work. According to medical estimates, a solid iron substance was invented, and 50,000 wounded soldiers were spared from death during the European War. In 1910, it was discovered that this substance could treat cancer, and as a result, many were cured. Madam Curie spent more than 20 years of hard work and finally discovered radium. During these 20 years, she often worked under the shade of trees in Paris. In her spare time, she drove a bicycle to rest. Madam Curie was born in 1867 in the countryside of Warsaw, Poland. Her father was a professor of mathematics and physics at the University of Warsaw, and her mother ran a girls' elementary school. Madam Curie was the youngest of five children. In her early years, she aspired to become a teacher. She first studied at a preliminary school, then entered a public school. At the age of seventeen, she was proficient in physics and mathematics. Later, she went to Paris to study for a doctorate and lived in a small room for five years, cooking for herself all year round. In winter, she carried coal baskets and climbed the high five-story building. All her time was spent studying. In 1896, she married Pierre Curie, a young French scientist, and worked hard while still diligently pursuing academic knowledge and serving as a class teacher in a girls' school. In 1879, her eldest daughter was born. Madam Curie, although already a mother, never stopped studying. The following year, she discovered a new substance, initially named Polonium, in memory of Madam Curie's hometown. Then radium was invented, after another four years of hard work, she extracted this substance into a pure chemical substance. In 1904, her second daughter was born. In 1906, Madam Curie encountered a tragic accident, as her husband was run over and killed by a car in Paris. Madam Curie then declined worldly affairs and lived alone with her two daughters. Her eldest daughter was her main assistant in her chemical laboratory, and her second daughter was a skilled pianist and also had a good reputation. Madam Curie once said that she often spent the whole day stirring a boiling furnace of chemicals with an iron bar as big as her body under the shade of trees, which was the happiest day of her life. After the couple invented radium and enjoyed world fame, they were always troubled by their inability to live quietly. But the two eventually chose a secluded place to live a simple life. After her husband and Pierre Curie died in an accident, Madam Curie's grief can be imagined, but she did not abandon her research work because of this. In 1907, the American wealthy man Carney provided a chemical laboratory, and Madam Curie began to have a well-equipped workplace. After the outbreak of the European War, Madam Curie organized a volunteer first aid team to go to the front line to rescue wounded soldiers. Madam Curie can be described as a model for women. Radium has many uses, and scientists have not yet fully exhausted its effects. For example, one gram of radium given to Madam Curie can completely exhaust its power in one minute, which can consume its lifespan of 20,000 years, can bring 32 tons of ice water to the boiling point, can make a 15,000-ton ship travel 15 miles per hour for 30 years. According to Ram Sejes, if this ship needs 1.5 million tons of coal. (Fourth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden Criticizes MacDonald</p>
<p>(London) Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden made an impassioned speech in the House of Lords today, criticizing Prime Minister MacDonald for mentioning the abolition of land tax, saying that in 1932 MacDonald had asked him not to resign from the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer, tears streaming down his face, guaranteeing that he would never abolish the land tax. But the government completely disregards all the promises made during the general election and fails to fulfill them. MacDonald only seeks to preserve his position as Prime Minister and does not hesitate to break his previous agreement and endure humiliation. Snowden is now 70 years old and presented the budget of the first Labour cabinet in April 1924. In 1931, he joined the organization of the National Unity Government. Before long, he was promoted to Viscount because of his merits. He resigned the following year because of disagreements with MacDonald. Snowden wrote several books to promote socialism.

<p>British Protection of Shipping</p>
<p>(London) Secretary of the Board of Trade Runciman declared in the House of Commons today that if the measures he is proposing fail, consideration may have to be given to applying different rates of taxation to foreign vessels and to stipulating that trade between the various parts of the Empire should be carried only in British vessels. Runciman first briefly described the method of subsidizing the indefinite shipping lines of British cargo ships for a period of 12 months, with a cost of £2 million. He then said that the British government has now consulted with the various autonomous regions and India in order to cooperate. The British government is now preparing to subsidize the demolition of old British cargo ships in order to build new cargo ships with fewer tons, or to transform existing ships to make them suitable for the new style. Runciman also said that since 1913, the world's ships have increased by 50%, while the shipping industry has declined compared with 1913. The British government intends to send a note to foreign countries to inquire about their views on an international plan to facilitate the implementation of the cancellation or reduction of shipping subsidies and to negotiate a plan for the intermittent mooring or demolition of redundant vessels. The Minister of Commerce also replied to the question that in February of this year, the goods imported by the various departments of the United Kingdom were worth a total of £22,420,000, of which 95% were shipped by British vessels. The goods imported by foreign countries were worth a total of £35,788,000, of which 50% were shipped by British vessels, 27% were shipped by vessels from the country of export, and the remaining 19% were shipped by various foreign vessels. Members of the House of Commons who are concerned about the issue gathered tonight to review the government's shipping proposals, all expressing satisfaction. Everyone said that the entire issue appears to be added to the shoulders of the shipowners. The government is now asking the shipowners to negotiate directly with foreign shippers, but the government has not given them any negotiating weapons. (Third Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>San Francisco Labor Strike</p>
<p>San Francisco - A riot broke out at the San Francisco dock labor strike today, injuring 20 people. In the afternoon, the workers continued to riot, overturning seven trucks, and throwing the goods in the trucks all over the street. One of the trucks was burned. Other workers and sympathizers fought with the police around the burning car. The police released tear gas, but the freight transport stopped at 4:00 PM. (Third National Telegraph)</p>
<p>San Francisco - The port of San Francisco has been blockaded for a long time since the dock workers' strike. Today, due to the forced opening of the port, a fierce riot occurred. The California Industrial Association ignored the request of the mediators sent by the President and still implemented the controlled opening of the port this afternoon. On the one hand, the striking workers also tried their best to resist. Seven hundred reserves from the San Francisco police stations, carrying batons, pistols, and tear gas, opened to the port to suppress them this morning. The striking workers had gathered in the early morning. At noon, when the Industrial Association was scheduled to open the port, the number of people gathered to 5,000. It was very quiet in the morning. The police did not allow the workers to approach the dock, and the workers did not resist slightly, but stood by and waited. By noon, there was still no action. The iron gates of the docks and warehouses were still tightly closed. At 1:20 PM, the capitalists began to launch. Two trucks loaded with goods drove out of Pier 38 of the McCammick Shipping Company, protected by a police car, and drove towards the place where the workers were gathered. At first, nothing happened. Before long, screams arose, and the crowd suddenly rushed towards the police, and the riot broke out. The crowd threw bricks and stones at the police, trying to break through the defense line and destroy the trucks. Although the police used batons to resist, they had to gradually retreat. At that time, the number of people in the crowd had increased to more than 7,000. The police threw a row of tear gas to make the workers retreat. Several people in the crowd were injured, and one policeman was slightly injured. At that time, the rioting workers all paid attention. The first two trucks were followed by three trucks from the number 38 pier, which drove to another warehouse. There were no major obstacles in the middle. After the police fired tear gas, the crowd gradually retreated. About 150 people were arrested by the police and will be imprisoned. At that time, five trucks had unloaded their goods and returned to the dock to load new goods. When they came back after loading, there were more people around the warehouse. Although the police tried their best to disperse them, they did not reduce the number much. However, there have been no major casualties so far. (Third National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Borah's War Debt Talk</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Borah, former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had asked President Roosevelt to maintain a strict attitude on the war debt issue. Now he has drafted an article for the Associated Press, expressing his views such as, "The international debt issue" has become increasingly chaotic. The reason is that the debtor countries are acting actively, and the creditor countries are acting passively. If the attitude of the United States is as strong as that of the debtor countries, they believe that all countries can pay. This debt has been negotiated for several years, and it has been greatly reduced. The reduction in France is about half, and the reduction in Italy is about 70%. They have all been negotiated after repeated studies. After the agreement, there is no need for any further problems to arise. They believe that there is no reason to discuss it again at this time. Moreover, the debtor countries all have the strength to repay, that is, they cannot repay it for a while, but it will only be delayed for a while. Therefore, the so-called credit payment should not be proposed except as a part of the repayment, because all debtor countries are trying to rely on it. When the President accepted the credit payment, he said that it was not overdue. This is his personal opinion and not the official action of the United States. Now this kind of debt has expired. If the debtor country does not pay, then only the American taxpayers will pay it on behalf of them. (Fourth National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Soviet High-Speed Train</p>
<p>400 Kilometers per Hour</p>
<p>(TASS News Agency, Moscow, June 3) In the second half of this year, in order to meet the needs of several large factories near Moscow, a high-speed train track will be laid between Moscow and Noginsk. The survey work of the road has been completed, with a total length of 53 kilometers. The first section of all equipment has been manufactured by Moscow factories. The road was designed by Soviet engineer Yelmolkhuk, who invented a new type of train that uses spherical rollers to rotate. The rollers have a powerful electric motor. According to theoretical calculations, the train can travel 400 kilometers per hour. The Moscow test plant is testing a section of the train, which is 9 meters long and has two spherical rollers. The rollers have a diameter of 2.2 meters and weigh one and a half tons each. They are wrapped in rubber to reduce friction.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Silk and Tea Market Gradually Active</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Since the opening of the Beiping-Shenyang railway, the sales of Zhejiang silk goods to the north, which had been stagnant for a long time, have gradually become loose yesterday and today. This year's tea production is not abundant, and tea shops in Hangzhou all feel that the source is lacking. However, the first tea holds a wait-and-see attitude because of its high water content, and the tea price has plummeted, causing many mountain guests to lose money. Since the preparation for the opening of the Beiping-Shenyang railway, the price of the second tea has risen day by day. The current selling price is about 60 yuan per load, which is one or twenty yuan higher than the first tea, creating a special phenomenon in the tea market. Therefore, the second tea mountain guests have made a lot of profits. (Third Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Details of the Bombing of the Beiping-Shenyang Railway</p>
<p>The Car Arrived at the Third-Class Car of Chadian Station and Suddenly Exploded</p>
<p>Nineteen Passengers Died or Were Injured Yin Tong Expressed a Passive Tianjin Correspondence. The first Beiping-Shenyang special express train departed from Beiping at 8:40 AM on July 1st, according to the scheduled time. When passing through Tianjin, it was 11:20 AM. After a few passengers got on and off, it continued to drive east. Unexpectedly, at 1:30 PM, a bomb exploded near the flag-raising place outside Chadian Station. After the incident, Yin Tong, Director of the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau, was the most passive. In addition to briefly reporting the incident to the Beiping-Shanghai-Nanjing three parties in the afternoon of the 1st, he sent another detailed telegram on the morning of the 2nd, reporting the details of the accident and the true situation. At the same time, Yin and Deputy Directors Xu Wenguo and Zheng Baozhao jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, saying that the first opening of the railway had this unfortunate incident, which was that the bureau directors had not done their best and failed to prevent it from happening, and resigned to take responsibility. After the telegram was sent, the bureau affairs were temporarily handed over to Deputy Directors Xu and Zheng to be responsible for handling before the Ministry of Railways replied. At about 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, the bureau held a meeting with Xu Wenguo and Zheng Baozhao as the center to discuss the aftermath of the injured passengers in the bombing. It was decided that the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau would prepare coffins for the dead and bury them. If the families were willing to transport the remains back to their hometowns, the transportation costs would be waived. Those who were injured and were being treated would have their medical expenses borne by the bureau until they recovered. This morning, another young passenger died in Dr. Ma's hospital. At the same time, a passenger who came to Tianjin from Beidaihe came to the railway bureau to inquire, claiming to be Yin Gongyi. He was taking a summer vacation in Beidaihe. He had a younger sister, Yin Dehui, who was 23 years old and a junior at Jinling University in Nanjing, and a younger brother, Yin Daoge, who was 22 years old and a graduate of Tsinghua University. He worked at China Industry Bank in Shanghai. Recently, because Beidaihe held a Jesus ceremony, he and his younger siblings were both members of the church, so he invited them to Beidaihe to participate in the ceremony together. When the two set off from Beijing, they had a telegram to him, saying that they would take the Beiping-Shenyang Railway on July 1st to Beidaihe, but yesterday when the train arrived in Beidaihe, there was no trace of the two. It happened that a Westerner shouted at the station, "Who is Yin Dehui's family?" He came forward to inquire, and the Westerner said that he had witnessed the bombing in Chadian and saw an injured woman who spoke fluent English and said that she was going to Beidaihe to meet her brother, but she was seriously injured and died soon after. He was afraid that it was not true, so he went to Chadian this morning to identify the female corpse, which turned out to be his younger sister, but he did not know how his younger brother was. He asked for instructions from the hospital so that he could go and identify him. The bureau immediately sent someone to guide him to Dr. Ma's hospital, where he saw that the deceased was indeed his younger brother. Yin saw the corpses of his younger siblings on the same day, and his grief was overwhelming. After being comforted by the railway bureau, he left the hospital and rushed to deal with the aftermath. The remaining four people, Liu Erchi (Hebei middle school student), Zhang Zhe first, Xu Hongye, and Gong Baolin, are being treated at Dr. Ma's hospital. Liu Erchi's injuries were serious, and blood was flowing from his ears, which has not stopped so far. There are also two patrol team police officers, Wang Zuotian and Chen Ming, who were also injured in the chest and arms and are being treated at the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau. In addition, there are passengers Wang Li's, a baby girl, and male passengers Chai Huating, Zhang Qingshan, and four others, who were treated at the Tanggu Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau on the fourth train that came from Yu Guan after the accident yesterday. At the time of the accident yesterday, the people who died on the spot were Jin Da, the tea servant of the 11th car that was bombed, who died with a broken abdomen and dragged intestines, Wang Li's, a ten-year-old girl, and Yin Dehui, a female student at Jinling University. When the fourth train transported the injured passengers to Tianjin and passed Tanggu, Song Li's, a woman from the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau, died due to severe lacerations behind her head and excessive bleeding. An unknown man also died due to serious injuries when he arrived at Tianjin East Station. As of today, a total of six people have died, all of whom have been coffin-buried and photographed by the railway bureau for families to identify.</p>
<p>According to the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau, the special express train arrived at the flag-raising place outside Chadian Station at 1:30 PM on the first day. An explosive was found in a piece of luggage on the partition of the 11th third-class passenger car connected to the locomotive. The explosive force was very strong, and the shed of the car was completely blown apart. At this time, the passengers were all injured to varying degrees. The driver heard the explosion and stopped moving forward, and jumped off the locomotive, causing both of them to be injured in the fall. For a time, the passengers in each section of the train were in chaos and jumped out of the carriages. After the train stopped, the car guard found out the reason and rushed to the Chadian Station to report to the Tianjin Railway Bureau. The bureau sent a locomotive and a medical emergency vehicle to the rescue at about 2:00 PM. At that time, many Western passengers in the car were going to Beidaihe for summer vacation, and many of them were carrying bandages, so they volunteered to wrap and rescue them. At 2:40 PM, the train continued to move forward. When passing Tangshan, the 11th car was removed and sent to the factory for repair. It is said</p>

<p>Due to the Hongkou Incident, the Issue of Police Authority in District C Arises; the Municipal Council Denies Granting Special Privileges to the Japanese Military; the Japanese Authorities Claim Japanese Residents Made No Demands and No Special Privileges Were Granted to the Japanese Military; according to the "Continental Times," a Certain Official of the Municipal Council Explained to Representatives of the "Continental Times" Yesterday (the 4th) That Although the Municipal Council Signed an Agreement with the Military Forces of Various Countries Stationed in Shanghai in 1927 Regarding the Issue of Police Authority, Which Conflicts with the Municipal Council's Responsibility for Police Affairs, It Did Not Grant the Japanese Military Privileges Not Enjoyed by the Military Forces of Other Countries Stationed There. The Following Is a Summary of the Remarks Made by the Official Yesterday: (1) The Municipal Council and Its Police Department Have Not Granted Japan Any Rights Not Enjoyed by Other Countries Stationed in Shanghai; (2) In September 1927, the Municipal Council Concluded an Agreement with Various Countries Stationed in Shanghai, Stipulating That Municipal Police Officers Should Not Interfere with Armed Military Personnel Deployed Within the Public Concession; (3) The Municipal Police Department Has the Authority to Arrest Military Personnel in Uniform or Plainclothes and Then Hand Them Over to Their Respective National Authorities, Provided That the Police Officers Have Legitimate Reasons for the Arrest; (4) The Municipal Council Is Currently Handling the Thorough Investigation of the Hongkou Case Under the Command of the Chief Inspector; the Personnel of the Thorough Investigation Department Are Selected by the Chief Inspector; (5) The Thorough Investigation May Take Several Days; Upon Completion of the Thorough Investigation, the Municipal Council Will Consider Its Judgment; the Municipal Council May Decide That the Case Is Concluded and No Further Action Is Necessary, or It May Notify the Japanese Authorities of the Details; (6) The Municipal Council Is Under No Obligation to Publicize the Results of the Thorough Investigation, and It Is Uncertain Whether It Will Do So; (7) It Was Not Clarified Whether Western Police Officer Pelami Was Forcibly Detained at the Japanese Naval Landing Force's Zhabei Road Branch. According to the "Continental Times," Points (1), (2), and (3) Above Are Inconsistent with the Statement Made by Nagata, Staff Officer of the Japanese Naval Landing Force, to the "Continental Times" Reporter. Nagata Stated at the Time That the Municipal Council Chief Inspector and the Japanese Authorities Had an Agreement in 1927, Stating That Municipal Police Officers Should Not Detain Any Japanese Military Personnel, Whether Deployed or Not, and Should Directly Escort Them to the Japanese Authorities. As for Point (7), on the Night of the Incident, When Pelami Was Detained at the Japanese Naval Landing Force's Zhabei Road Branch, a "Continental Times" Reporter Inquired of a Senior Police Officer Why Pelami Was Still Detained and Had Not Been Released. The Officer Replied That It Was Necessary to Wait for the Order of the Japanese Naval Commander Before He Could Be Released. Subsequently, After Nagata Received the Commander's Order, Pelami Was Released. Japanese Residents Plot to Become Police Commissioner; the "Continental Times" Also Reported That Because Foreign Residents in Hongkou Are Now Predominantly Japanese, They Are Engaging in an Organized Movement to Have a Japanese National Appointed as the Police Commissioner of the Municipal Council to Replace Captain Conneally, Police Chief of District C. The Municipal Police Department Divides the Public Concession Into Four Districts; District C Is the Area North of the Suzhou River, Which Includes Four Police Stations: Hongkou Police Station, West Hongkou Police Station, Jiaxing Road Police Station, and Diswell Road Police Station. This Movement Is Being Led by the Japanese Residents' Association. A Spokesperson for the Association Told a "Continental Times" Representative Yesterday That While the Issue Is Still Under Discussion Among Japanese Community Leaders, Formal Action Is Expected to Be Taken Within a Few Days. Japanese Authorities Deny This Claim; according to the "North China Daily Mail," the Japanese Authorities Denied This Morning (the 4th) Having Any Knowledge of the Japanese Residents' Association's Plot to Replace Captain Conneally, Police Chief of District C, with a Japanese Official. According to a Spokesperson for the Japanese Consulate-General, Speaking to a "North China Daily Mail" Representative, the Japanese Residents' Association Would Not Undertake Such a Movement Without First Consulting the Consular Authorities. Such Rumors May Have Originated from the Personal Opinions Expressed by Several Members of the Japanese Residents' Association, as Many Japanese Residents Now Desire to Have a Japanese National Serve as Police Chief of the Hongkou District. Japanese Consul Notifies Japanese Residents to Exercise Restraint; Yesterday, the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" Reported That at 10:00 AM on the 4th, the Japanese Consulate-General Convened a Meeting of Various Residents' Associations and Police Officers to Discuss the Unfortunate Incidents That Had Occurred Repeatedly on Zhabei Road. Attendees Included the Consul-General, Police Chief Ketsu, Police Station Chief Hanari, Police Inspector Fukuyama, and Other Senior Officers, as Well as Standing Committee Members from the Residents' Associations, Such as Chairman Kanō, Hayashi, Kondo, Tokunaga, Ashizawa, Matsue, Mimura, Tanaka, Kanatani, Okajima, Takahashi, and Sato. They Discussed Preventing the Recurrence of Incidents and Handling Incidents When They Occur. As a Result of the Discussions, Each Residents' Association Was Instructed to Issue Notices to All Japanese Residents, Urging Them to Exercise Restraint and Refrain from Reckless Actions, and to Enforce Regulations. At the Same Time, They Agreed to Collaborate with the Municipal Council Police and the Consular Police to Jointly Prevent Incidents.

Xu Dongfan's Letter to Zhu Jiaqi Says Shanghai-Ping Air Route Should Detour Via Weihai; With Summer Season Bringing Influx of Tourists, Airport in Weihai Urgently Needs to Be Established; the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Previously Received a Letter from Xu Dongfan, the Commissioner of Weihaiwei, Discussing Detouring the Shanghai-Ping Air Route Via Weihai to Facilitate Transportation to the Port. After Detailed Discussions, the Company Received a Telegram from the Ministry of Transportation Instructing Them to Thoroughly Study the Matter of Air Service to Weihai and to Proceed Accordingly If No Technical Difficulties Arose in Flight Operations. Now, Commissioner Xu Has Sent Another Letter to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Transportation, Urging the Company to Expedite the Matter, As the Summer Season Is Underway and an Influx of Westerners Seeking Refuge from the Heat Has Created an Urgent Need to Establish an Airport. The Original Letter Reads: "Minister Liu, Greetings. Regarding the matter of establishing an airport in Weihaiwei, I Previously Received Your Telegram Stating That the CNAC Had Been Instructed to Conduct a Thorough Study and to Proceed Accordingly If No Technical Difficulties Arose in Flight Operations, Etc. All the People of Weihaiwei Were Overjoyed to Hear This, and I Believe That This Matter Is Truly a Pressing Need for Weihaiwei Today. This Is Because There Are Over 8,000 Members of the British Navy Seeking Refuge from the Heat Here, Including Over 100 Senior Officers and Nearly 600 Officers of All Ranks, As Well As Other Ordinary Tourists. Their Salaries and Benefits Are Generous, and We Have Heard That They Spend a Total of 800,000 Pounds Sterling Each Month, but They Are Concerned That Weihaiwei Is Small and It Is Difficult to Purchase Goods, and They Often Think of Traveling to Shanghai and Ping to Sightsee. If an Airport Could Be Established, They Could Travel Freely and Transportation Would Be Convenient. Therefore, Establishing an Airport in Weihai Will Inevitably Lead to Thriving Business in the Future; This Is One Reason. If There Are Concerns About Insufficient Time, the Truth Is That It Takes Eight Hours to Fly from Shanghai to Ping. A Detour to Weihai Adds Two Hours, Which Is Sufficient. Even If It Takes Three Hours, for a Total of Eleven Hours, the Weather in Summer and Autumn Is Longer, and Taking Off from Shanghai at 7:00 AM Would Mean Arriving in Ping at No More Than 6:00 PM; There Would Be No Shortage of Time and Landing Would Not Be Inconvenient; This Is the Second Reason. As for the Short Days in Winter, Operations Could Be Suspended As Appropriate. At a Time When the Aviation Business Is Waiting to Develop, Considering the Situation in Weihaiwei, This Is a Matter of Great Importance for the Future. I Propose That You Exert Your Influence to Support It and Instruct the Company to Expedite the Matter and Commence Service Soon to Benefit Transportation and the Local Community; I Am Most Eagerly Awaiting a Response. As for the Affairs of the Airport, This Office Can Voluntarily Handle Them on Behalf of the Company to Avoid Increasing the Company's Expenses. I Am Reporting This Again to Facilitate Coordination, Etc." The Ministry of Finance Prepares to Abolish Various Inland Customs Stations; If Deemed Necessary in Practice, One or Two May Be Retained; This Plan Is Gradually Becoming Concrete; Preparations Will Be Completed Soon and Implementation Will Follow; the Ministry of Finance Has Been Conducting Detailed Research on Reorganizing Customs Affairs Through Its Relevant Agencies, Such As the Customs Administration and the Inspectorate General of Customs. It Is Anticipated That a Major Reform Plan Will Be Developed and Is Currently Being Planned and Implemented. The "New Voices" News Agency Has Learned That It Is Proposed That Customs Stations Should Be Established Primarily Along the Coast. Customs Stations Such as Jianghai, Jinhai, Yuehai, Minhai, Jiaohai, Zhehai, Ouhai, Xiamen, and Qionghai Are All Located on the Coast. The Import and Export of Ships Will Be Subject to Tax and Duty Collection by the Coastal Customs Stations. Moreover, Foreign Vessels Are Prohibited from Sailing Into Inland Rivers Without Permission, Which Has Long Been a Regulation. In the Future, Foreign Vessels Must Declare and Pay Taxes Upon Entry; Otherwise, They Will Be Considered Smuggling and Subject to Confiscation and Penalties. As for Customs Stations Along the Yangtze River and Inland Areas, Such As Jianghan, Wuhu, Changyue, Chongqing, Zhenjiang, Jiujiang, Yichang, Jinling, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Jingsha, the Ministry of Finance Believes That It Is Unnecessary to Waste Public Funds. It Is Only Necessary to Increase the Anti-Smuggling Capabilities of Coastal Customs Stations to Prevent Tax Evaders From Importing Into Inland Areas. Furthermore, Their Inland Partial Affairs Can Be Merged Into Tax Bureaus of a Similar Nature, Which Can Save a Portion of the Customs Expenses of Various Inland Customs Stations Each Year. If It Is Deemed Absolutely Necessary in Practice, One or Two May Be Retained. This Plan Is Now Gradually Becoming Concrete, but It Still Requires Detailed Preparation Before It Can Be Implemented. Cunningham Left for Japan Yesterday to Escape the Heat; the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Cunningham, Left Shanghai on the Japanese Ship "Hōten Maru" at 9:00 AM Yesterday Due to the Summer Heat. He Is Traveling to Dalian and Will Then Proceed to Japan Via Shenyang and Korea to Escape the Heat. He Is Scheduled to Return to Shanghai in Three to Four Weeks. During Cunningham's Absence, All Important Matters Will Be Handled by Consul Charles Reed. Rice Prices Are Rising Daily; the Bureau of Social Affairs Is Studying Relief Measures; Remarks by Director Zhou of the Food Division; Efforts Will Be Made to Limit Excessive Rice Price Increases; Since the Beginning of Summer, There Has Been No Rain for a Long Time, and the Scorching Sun Is Evaporating Rivers and Ponds, Threatening Drought. Rice Prices Are Rising Daily, Causing Apprehension Among the Public. A Central News Agency Reporter Inquired About This Matter With Zhou Minggang, Director of the Food Division of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. According to Him, the Bureau Is Already Exploring Relief Measures. The Information Learned Is Reported As Follows: Reasons for Rising Rice Prices; According to Director Zhou, Since Last Year's Abundant Harvest in Various Regions Led to a Sharp Drop in Prices, the Impact on the Rural Economy Has Been Significant. In Order to Rescue the Rural Economy, the Government Increased Import Taxes on Foreign Rice, Which Allowed Domestic Rice Prices to Increase. However, Recently, Rice Prices Have Exceeded 10 Yuan Per Stone. The Reasons for This Are: First, It Is the Time Between Harvests, and Historically, Rice Prices Inevitably Rise During This Period; Second, There Has Been No Rain Recently, Threatening Drought; and Third, Stored Rice Has Been Accumulating for a Long Time, and Its Quantity Has Decreased. Therefore, Rice Prices Have Increased, but the Extent of the Increase Deserves Attention. Studying Relief Measures; During This Period, Most Farmers Have Already Converted Last Year's Harvest Into Cash. Therefore, During This Period, There Are Instead Those Who Buy Rice to Eat. Now That Rice Prices Are Rising, the Burden on Farmers Is Significantly Affected. If It Does Not Rain Again and a Drought Occurs, the Suffering of Farmers Will Further Increase. Therefore, The Bureau Has Now Decided to Begin Studying Relief Measures. The Current Problem Is to Limit the Excessive Increase in Rice Prices. As for Future Problems, This Will Depend on the Weather and Economic Capacity. It Is Difficult to Determine Concrete Measures Now. The Customs Office Changes Storm Warning Signals; Announcement No. 1057 of the Marine Department of the Inspectorate General of Customs States: "It Is Hereby Ordered by the Inspector General of Customs That 'The Signal Stations Under the Jurisdiction of the Customs Offices at Various Ports in China Have Previously Used Two Black Balls to Indicate a Warning of Approaching Typhoons, Which Is Hereby No Longer Applicable and Should Be Abolished From July 15th of This Year and Replaced With a Black "X" Signal for Unification and to Benefit Navigation.

Da Hu Dance Hall Sues Three Liang Sisters; The Three Sisters Repented Mid-Contract and Went Elsewhere; They Should Return Their Dance Hall Salary and Allowance; The Three Dance Hall Sisters, Liang Saizhen, Saizhu, and Saisan, Originally Performed at the Da Hu Dance Hall Under Contract. However, Recently, They Suddenly Left the Da Hu Without Waiting for the Contract to Expire and Went to Another Dance Hall. Li Hongyuan, Director of the Da Hu, Negotiated With Them, but to No Avail. Therefore, He Retained Attorneys Wu Peng and Jiang Yiping to Sue the Liang Sisters in the First Special District Court for Breach of Contract, Requesting That the Court Order the Three Defendants to Pay Damages of Over 14,000 Yuan. The Grounds for the Lawsuit Are Briefly As Follows: The Three Defendant Sisters Were Dance Hall Performers at the Da Hu From January 1st of This Year. It Was Stipulated That They Would Receive a Monthly Allowance of 100 Yuan Plus 15 Yuan for Transportation Expenses, With a Term of 13 Months. If They Repented Mid-Contract or Violated the Regulations, They Agreed to Return All Dance Hall Salary and Allowance, and a Contract Was Signed as Proof. However, the Defendants Repented Without Cause From the 16th of This Month and Arbitrarily Left to Perform As Dance Hall Performers Elsewhere, Which Constitutes Intentional Breach of Contract. According to Article 2 of the Contract, They Should Return All Dance Hall Salary and Allowance Received During the Term and Be Required to Reimburse for Meal Losses. It Is Found That Liang Saizhen Received a Total of 5,206.5 Yuan in Dance Hall Salary and 953.2 Yuan in Allowance From January 1st of This Year to June 15th, a Total of Five Months and Fifteen Days. She Also Received 165 Yuan for Meals at 1 Yuan Per Day. Liang Saizhu Received a Total of 3,192.1 Yuan in Dance Hall Salary and 448.7 Yuan in Allowance. She Also Received 165 Yuan for Meals.

It Is Reported That After Receiving the Lawsuit, the Court Has Issued Summons and Ordered Bailiffs to Notify the Liang Sisters at Their Residence at No. 8 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road, to Appear in Court for Interrogation. The Macdowell vs. Zhang Xueliang Case; Is This Case Admissible, as Zhang Is an Active Duty Soldier?; Zhang Xueliang, the Current Deputy Commander of the Three Northeastern Provinces' Bandit Suppression Force Stationed in Hankou, Has a Financial Dispute With an American Named Macdowell. When Zhang Resigned From His Position As Acting Chairman of the Peiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission Last Year and Came to Shanghai As a Retired Official, the American Approached Him to Demand Payment, but Zhang Denied the Debt, and the Matter Was Not Resolved. Later, Zhang Traveled to Europe and the United States, and the American Retained an Attorney to File a Lawsuit. However, Because Zhang Was Abroad, It Was Difficult to Serve Him With a Summons. They Wanted to Apply to the Court for Public Notice Service, but According to the Law, Public Notice Service Is Only Allowed If the Defendant's Address Is Unknown. Zhang's Whereabouts Are Reported in Chinese and Foreign Newspapers, So It Is Not As If His Address Is Unknown, and It Does Not Seem to Be Applicable to the Regulations of Public Notice Service. They Wanted to Request That the Court Send the Summons to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Forwarding to the Country He Was Visiting, but Zhang's Whereabouts Are Uncertain, and It Is Difficult to Guarantee That He Would Receive It. For These Reasons, the Case Could Only Be Temporarily Suspended. Recently, Zhang Has Returned to China and Has Again Taken Up a Military Position, Opening a Government Office in Wuhan. Based on the Plaintiff Macdowell's Lawsuit, the First Special District Court in This City Convened a Hearing in the Fourth Tribunal at 9:00 AM Yesterday, With Judge Mo Runhua Presiding. The Plaintiff Was Represented by An American Attorney From Yamashita &amp; Co., and the Defendant Zhang Xueliang Did Not Attend. He Retained Two Attorneys to Appear in Court on His Behalf, Stating That Zhang Was an Active Duty Soldier and Was Stationed in Wuhan, Which Is Not Under the Jurisdiction of Your Honorable Court. They Requested That the Court Order the Termination of the Lawsuit. The Plaintiff's Attorney Expressed Opposition. Judge Mo Stated That Whether the Case Should Be Accepted Would Be Decided After Review and Instructed Both Sides' Attorneys, Who Then Left. Therefore, Neither Party Mentioned the Substance of the Case Yesterday. Selling Ancestral Property Leads to Greed and Blackmail From a Friend; A Package of Red Pills Is Used As Bait; Searching and Extorting En Route; Xu Jintao, a Local Villager Residing in a Flat in the Liu Pu Residence on Rue Aisimès in the French Concession, Is 36 Years Old and Works As a Farmer. He Is Addicted to Opium and Often Visits the Red Pill Hall Opened by Chen Haisheng, a Local Resident at No. 52 Youyi Lane, Rue Cardinal Mercier. Recently, Xu Sold a Piece of Ancestral Property and Received 15,000 Gold Coins. Chen Haisheng Learned of This and Conspired With Yu Jinbao, a Local Resident Residing at No. 564 Rue Zikawei, to Extort Money. Yu Colluded With Du Yinglin, a Local Resident Working As a No. 23 Detective in the French Police Station at No. 19, Lane 80, Rue Bayard, to Reach an Agreement. At About 2:00 AM on the 14th of Last Month, Xu Jintao Went to Chen Haisheng's Place to Smoke Again. After He Was Done, Chen Pretended to Give Xu a Package of Red Pills, Saying That If It Was Inconvenient, He Could Smoke at Home to Avoid Traveling Back and Forth. Xu Was Grateful for Chen's Kindness and Gladly Put It in His Pocket and Returned Home. Chen Immediately Notified Yu and Du, Who Gathered Ruffians to Wait at the Intersection of Rue Cardinal Mercier and Avenue du Père Froc. When Xu Passed By, They Swarmed Forward, Blocked Him, and Du Used a Handgun to Intimidate and Search Xu's Body, Finding the Red Pills. They Pretended to Want to Take Him to the Police Station for Investigation. Xu Was Anxious and Begged Them Bitterly. The Ruffians Nearby Acted As Mediators, Saying That the Matter Could Be Resolved Privately. They Took Xu to the Chunjiang Inn Behind the Great World on Caishi Street to Discuss Extorting 250 Yuan. At This Point, Xu Had No Choice but to Agree and Had His Wife Liu Fetch the Money, Which Was Paid in Full, and He Was Released. Later, Xu Was Unwilling to Accept This and Reported the Matter to the French Police Station, Which Sent Detectives to Arrest Yu, Du, and Chen. The Red Pill Lamp and Gun Were Also Found in Chen's Home. They Were Sent to the Second Special Court, and the Police Station's Attorney Charged Them With the Crime of Intimidation and Extortion. Xu Jintao Also Retained an Attorney to File a Private Lawsuit, Seeking to Recover the Extorted Money. After Judge Xiong Huiping Concluded the Trial, Yu Jinbao Was Sentenced to Three Months in Prison for Intentionally Obtaining Illegal Property Through Intimidation. Du Yinglin (Same Charge) Was Sentenced to Four Months in Prison. Chen Jinsheng Was Sentenced to Three Months in Prison for Smoking Opium Substitutes.

The Snake's Head Was Extending and Retracting Toward the Corner of the Mosquito Net, Which Was Very Frightening. Xu's Nephew Yu Meisheng (17 Years Old) Caught a Glimpse of It and Initially Thought It Was the Light From a Lamp Shining on the Mosquito Net. Upon Closer Inspection, He Realized It Was a Python and Was Very Frightened. Xu and Wang Were Also Startled Awake. At This Time, Xu Derun and Others Were Cooling Off on the Terrace and Rushed Into the Room Upon Hearing the Noise. They Were at a Loss for What to Do. They Considered Sending Someone to Find a Snake-Catching Beggar to Catch It, but It Was Difficult to Find One Late at Night. As a Result, Xu Summoned Fang Xuechen, a Security Team Member From Zhenjiang (39 Years Old), and Fang's Colleagues Bian Yutian and Lao Chen, a Tianjin Native Who Worked As a Gardener in the Quanzhang Guild Hall on Limalu Street. Fang Devised a Way to Capture It, and They Held the Python Upside Down Outside the Door, Where It Vomited Up One Large Dead Rat and Four Small Rats. Fang Then Killed It on the Spot and Handed It Over to Bian and Lao Chen to Drag to the Garden in the Quanzhang Guild Hall, Waiting for Fang to Come and Discuss What to Do With It. Unexpectedly, They Waited Until 5:00 AM Yesterday Morning and Fang Did Not Come.

<p>Department of Education Order: Thoroughly and Practically Reorganize; Merge the Law and Commerce Colleges; Substantially Consolidate and Eliminate Departments in the Women's College; All Colleges Permitted to Enroll Students; Crack Down on Teacher Absences and Student Truancy</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) Before the spring break this year, the Ministry of Education dispatched inspectors Sun Guofeng, Guo Youshou, Liu Yingshi, Zhou Tianfang, etc., to Beiping to inspect various national and private universities and specialized schools. They also went to Tianjin, Baoding, Kaifeng, and other places to conduct inspections. Their inspection of Beiping University was the most thorough. Currently, based on the inspectors' reports, the Ministry of Education has issued an order to reorganize Beiping University. The important points of this order are to instruct the university to concentrate authority, reallocate funding, merge the Law and Commerce Colleges into a single College of Law and Commerce, with a Commerce Department within it and Russian as a required course. The Women's College must earnestly implement the consolidation and elimination measures stipulated in last year's ministry order, strictly enforce a full-time system for faculty and staff, and crack down on teacher absences and student truancy. After receiving the order, the acting president of the university, Xu Songming, immediately convened a temporary university affairs meeting to discuss implementation methods. Decisions were also made regarding student enrollment matters. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the university's reorganization, Xu urgently telegraphed the new president of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Xu Shoushang, and the former dean of the College of Commerce, Zuo Zonglun, today (the 3rd), urging them to return to Beiping quickly to jointly plan the execution. The faculty and students of the College of Commerce, concerned about their personal interests due to the college's merger into the College of Law, separately organized a "College Protection Association" today (the 3rd) to strive for their rights. Detailed information from all parties is recorded below.</p>
<p>Five Reorganization Measures</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Reorganizes Beiping University. The general idea is that, according to the inspectors' reports, although some colleges within the university have been more conscientious in recent years, there are still many areas that urgently need improvement. Therefore, key points are presented to be followed and implemented thoroughly to allow for improvement. The key points of the reorganization are divided into five categories:</p>
<p>(1) Improve Organization: The office of the president should be moved into the College of Law. Matters such as student registration, faculty and staff appointments, and the preparation of budgets and final accounts should all be handled centrally by the president's office to prevent each college from acting independently and hindering the progress of university affairs.</p>
<p>(2) Reallocate Funding: Funding should be reallocated in accordance with the standards set in Article 10 of the University Regulations and considering the performance and actual needs of each college, and then submitted to the ministry for approval. Expenditures on office expenses and salaries exceeding the standards set by the ministry should be reduced. Equipment expenses should not be less than 25%.</p>
<p>(3) Reorganize Colleges and Departments: (1) The Law and Commerce Colleges should be merged into the College of Law and Commerce, with the original site of the College of Law as its location. Starting from the 23rd academic year, the College of Law and Commerce should establish a Commerce Department with Russian as a required subject to cultivate talent for border commerce. Students from the original College of Commerce's departments of Law, Political Science, and Economics should be integrated into corresponding classes in the original College of Law. Students from the departments of International Trade, Business Administration, and Transportation Management should either be integrated into existing classes or continue in separate classes to complete their studies. However, these three departments should no longer admit new students. (2) The four classes of Group B of the College of Law should be merged into Group A and offer a Russian course for optional study. However, since the number of students choosing to study Russian is not large, classes should be combined. (3) The various departments of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences were ordered to be consolidated and eliminated last year, but this has not been thoroughly implemented. In the next academic year, the college should earnestly implement the previous order and not use departmental consolidation and group division as a disguise. Whether the English Department should be established as an independent department will be decided by the university based on its assessment of the situation and reported for approval.</p>
<p>(4) Strictly Enforce Full-Time Employment for Faculty and Staff: College deans and department heads should absolutely not hold concurrent teaching or administrative positions outside the university. Those holding concurrent positions within the university should not receive additional compensation. Teachers lecturing at other places should be strictly restricted. Teachers should be full-time as a general rule.</p>
<p>(5) Crack Down on Teacher Absences and Student Truancy: The university should rigorously formulate and implement measures to crack down on these issues.</p>
<p>In addition to the above five key points, it is reported that key points for improvement in each college will be listed separately to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Xu Songming Discusses Consolidation and Elimination</p>
<p>Beiping University President Xu Songming told reporters that he had heard about the merger of the Law and Commerce Colleges several days before leaving the department. He repeatedly listed reasons against the merger to the Ministry of Education authorities and detailed the efforts made by the College of Commerce in recent years to reorganize. After returning to Beiping, he sent letters and telegrams requesting that the current situation be maintained. However, the ministry's position was firm and did not grant permission. Therefore, he had no choice but to comply with the order. Now, observing the contents of the ministry order, the establishment of a Commerce Department within the College of Law and Commerce, with Russian as a required course to cultivate talent for border commerce, and the fact that existing students can continue to complete their studies, are consistent with the original purpose of establishing the College of Commerce and are not entirely different from ending it. It is planned that the current dean of the College of Commerce, Zuo, will be appointed as the director of the Commerce Department after the merger of the Law and Commerce Colleges, to take advantage of his expertise. The restriction on faculty and staff holding concurrent positions will be implemented immediately, but at the same time, the situation in other universities will be considered and salaries will be raised.</p>
<p>All Colleges to Enroll Students</p>
<p>After receiving the Ministry of Education's reorganization order, Beiping University immediately convened a temporary university affairs meeting. Those present were Acting President Xu Songming, Dean of the College of Law Bai Pengfei, Secretary of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences Zhang Yuzheng, Dean of the College of Agriculture Liu Yunchou, and Secretary of the College of Commerce Zhou Zechang. Also in attendance were Ding Yusheng, Chief of the Academic Affairs Section of the Office; Lü Jiemin, Chief of the General Affairs Section; and Tao Liang, Secretary Representative. Xu Songming chaired the meeting and Tao Liang took the minutes. After the meeting began, Xu read the Ministry of Education's reorganization order and then began discussing implementation methods, which were generally decided and will be implemented accordingly. Immediately afterwards, the Enrollment Committee was convened to discuss student enrollment matters for each college, as well as faculty appointments and cracking down on teacher absences and student truancy. These matters require further discussion. The resolution on enrollment issues is as follows: 1. All colleges and departments will enroll students. 2. The enrollment brochure was approved. 3. The registration period is from July 27 to August 2. Physical examinations will begin on August 5. Preliminary exams will begin on August 10.</p>
<p>Bai Appointed Dean of the College of Law and Commerce</p>
<p>Bai Pengfei was originally the dean of the College of Law and has held the position for many years. Among the deans of the various colleges at Beiping University, Bai is the most senior. In this reorganization of Beiping University by the Ministry of Education, the College of Commerce will be merged into the College of Law and renamed the College of Law and Commerce. Beiping University Acting President Xu Songming appointed Bai as the dean of the College of Law and Commerce today (the 3rd) and notified the other colleges. It is reported that Deng Bocui has been internally appointed as the secretary of the college, while former dean of the College of Commerce Zuo Zonglun will be appointed as the director of the Commerce Department of the College of Law and Commerce. Whether Zuo will take the position depends on Zuo's decision after returning to Beiping from Beijing.</p>
<p>Bai Speaks Against the Merger</p>
<p>The reporter interviewed Dean Bai Pengfei of the College of Law at Beiping University today (the 3rd). According to Bai, he had not been consulted about the merger of the Law and Commerce Colleges. He only learned of the merger at the university affairs meeting called by President Xu yesterday. The implementation of the merger will be handled by the office. Bai stated that he wished for each college at Beiping University to exist and develop independently and was against merging them. He said that each college has its own long and glorious history. Apart from this, he had no other comments. As for the College of Law itself, he will expand the research laboratory, revise the curriculum, and renovate the buildings of the three colleges after the new budget is decided. Internal reorganization is still being planned.</p>
<p>Faculty and Students of the College of Commerce Protect the College</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Education ordered the College of Commerce at Beiping University to be merged into the College of Law and renamed the College of Law and Commerce, the faculty and students of the college were quite alarmed. Today (the 3rd), they separately convened general meetings to discuss ways to protect the college. The faculty and students decided to unanimously protect the college, telegraph the whole country, state everything, and ask for help from all sectors. The details of the faculty and student meetings are recorded below.</p>

<p>Educational Associations of Various Counties in Jiangsu Province to Hold Regular Joint Meetings</p>
<p>Unanimously Demand Guarantee of Independent Educational Funding</p>
<p>Oppose the Province's Uniform Revenue and Expenditure Method.

<p>Recent Situation of Graduates from the Sino-French Pharmaceutical College</p>
<p>The Sino-French University Pharmaceutical College on Albert Road in this city has been established for four years, with a total of forty graduates. The special class of 1931 graduated twenty-six people, who were originally members of the Shanghai Pharmacists' Association and have been serving in various pharmacies in Shanghai and other places for a long time. The first regular class of 1933 graduated thirteen people, ten of whom passed the four exams and have already been sent to work in various military, government, health agencies, and pharmacies. The three who passed the make-up exam were also sworn in and received their certificates the day before yesterday (July 2nd). The sixteen graduates of the second class of this year have completed their first graduation exam yesterday and will be assigned to pharmacies for internship and four will be selected to go to the Nanjing Health Department for internship to prepare for future work in health technology. The names of the graduates of the first class and their recent whereabouts have been obtained and are excerpted as follows: Wang Dianxiang and Wu Yuwan are currently studying at the University of Lyon in France (funded by the school). Ye Huichou and Dai Kai are currently assistant teachers at the school. Zhang Rui, Chen Houbei, and Sun Jichang are currently military pharmaceutical officers in the Fourth Army Group of Guangxi. Hua Fuchou is currently the deputy manager and pharmacist of the Dade Pharmacy in Hangzhou. Ke Dasan is currently the pharmacy director of the Renji Hospital in Ningbo. Nong Yechang is currently a technician in the Ministry of Interior Health Department. Huang Xiyan is a researcher at the Health Department's Chemical Testing Department. Hou Jin [omitted] was formerly at the Jin Ying Pharmacy and is about to leave Shanghai for Beiping after being hired by a pharmacy in Beiping. Zhou Shiyu was formerly at the Golden Eagle Pharmacy and may be transferred to Guangxi by the department. It is reported that last year, the Guangxi Provincial Government first sent a letter to pre-hire adults from the first class of the department. Due to insufficient manpower, the department only introduced three people. The remaining seven will wait for the second class to graduate and then be dispatched as appropriate. However, the second class is still half a year away from graduation, but nine people have already been assigned positions. In addition, the Guangxi Provincial Government specifically provides subsidies to students from Guangxi, giving each person 300 to 400 yuan per year without delay. It can be seen that the construction industry is progressing day by day, and pharmaceutical talents are also extremely important.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Denies Silver Export Ban; Gold Market Sellers Become Active</p>
<p>丨Falls by Four Dollars and Forty Cents Compared to Before the Holiday丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was jittery due to the bank holiday, the fluctuating overseas silver market, and rumors of a ban on silver exports. However, after Minister Kong officially denied the ban, sellers became active and prices fell. Midway, unfavorable news caused fatigue, but prices managed to rebound after hitting a low. The market situation was uncertain.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market had been under pressure for three days, with London decreasing and the US increasing. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose nearly six cents to a range of 3.5 cents, while the spot price decreased by two to eight cents. Exchange rates had already begun to rise. London spot gold rose by two and a half pence, US cotton fell by eight points, and US wheat decreased by 2.375 cents.</p>
<p>Unfavorable news reports circulated, and pre-market trading opened, immediately retreating to within 80 yuan and fluctuating between 78 and 79 yuan. The situation was still tentative, and the price briefly exceeded 80 yuan after opening, but the upward momentum lacked sustainability. After banks released exchange notes, sellers in the market became excited and gradually pushed prices down.</p>
<p>Furthermore, foreign telegrams reported that the US government planned to issue over 200 million yuan in public bonds and continue purchasing silver to issue silver certificates, with the price set at $1.29. President Roosevelt had completely entrusted the power to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Due to these unfavorable telegrams, the domestic market weakened, morale wavered, and selling intensified, leading to a price decline. However, banks took advantage of the low prices to cover positions, and the forward US dollar managed to rise, although it was a struggle.</p>
<p>Subsequently, morale remained unsettled, and the market struggled to maintain its position, showing fatigue and uncertainty. The Seattle night market silver price was reported to have decreased by 25.125 cents. The Central Bank opened spot bidding slightly, and the price was pulled up after hitting a low. At noon, the market continued to fluctuate, with a slightly stable underlying trend. The price of pure gold was calculated at 987 yuan and eight jiao. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 978 yuan and eight jiao, a decrease of 3 yuan and four jiao compared to the closing price before the holiday. The opening price for goods was 9 yuan. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 4.25 pence for British currency and 34.3125 yuan for US currency. Fuxing Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Tongtaichang, and others immediately entered the market and pushed the price up to 80 yuan and two jiao. Mitsui Da Ying offered September US dollars at 625, while Yongli, Bingxing, Yuanyi, Fuxing Yong, Zhaofeng, Chang Wanxing, and others sold contracts. Mitsui offered September US dollars at 6875, causing the price to fall to 76 yuan and seven jiao. Yu Qingyong purchased contracts, pushing the price up to 7 yuan and eight jiao. It was learned that HSBC had posted rates, with British currency flat and US currency up 125. The exchange market continued to strengthen. Da Ying released October US dollars at 875 and September at 75. Dachen Dingsheng Kang, Yuan Yi, and others aggressively sold, causing the price to drop to 5 yuan. Macary, Shanghai Hua Bi purchased October US dollars at 875, and Yu Qingyong, Yongli, Hanhang, Fuyu, Tongtaichang, Dafa, Yongfu, and An entered at 7 yuan. Hengtai, Hengyu, Dacheng, Daxing Yong, and others jointly sold contracts, and the price retreated to 5 yuan and three jiao. Zhengjin Hua Bi also offered September US dollars at 6875. The Dalian Gang continued to purchase, and Yi Fengyong also joined in. Macary purchased October US dollars at 75, and the price rebounded to 7 yuan and eight jiao. Shengda Zhengchang came to sell, causing the price to fall to 6 yuan and four jiao. Yongli, Tongtaichang, Fuyu, and Yi Fengyong entered the market. Citibank took October US dollars at 75, and the price rose again to 8 yuan and five jiao. Yuanyi Shengda Ruixing supplied at high prices, while the Dalian Gang and Fu An entered. At this point, the market was relatively stable. Subsequently, Yuanyi Dacheng Yongfeng, and individual investors sold, causing the price to retreat to 6 yuan and five jiao. The Seattle night market silver price was reported to have decreased by 25 cents, and the situation remained stable. The Central Bank opened spot trading, Yingfeng Heng Hui Xiang Wanxing De Kang came in and the price rose to around 8 yuan. Fuyu divested, causing the price to fall to 6 yuan and nine jiao. Fuxing Yong then entered the market, and the price was pulled up by 1 yuan again. The noon closing price was 977 yuan and eight jiao, and the goods were quoted at 7 yuan and five jiao. After the market closed, Hengyu initially sold at a flat price, but because Shunmao Fuxing Yong and others entered, the price eventually rose to above 8 yuan.</p>
<p>The highest price during the first half of the day was 980 yuan and two jiao, and the lowest price was 975 yuan and six jiao, a difference of 5 yuan and two jiao. As a result, the price decreased by 4 yuan and four jiao compared to the closing price before the holiday.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on HSBC's US dollar rate, which rose 125 to 33 yuan and 75 cents. The calculated gold price was 1025 yuan, 1 jiao and 8 cents. Based on the closing price, about 47 yuan was deducted, about half a yuan more than before the holiday. The registered price for July was 977 yuan, and for August was 978 yuan. The morning supplement was 977 yuan, and the pure gold price was 987 yuan and eight jiao. Market trading was relatively flat, with Tianjin goods quoted at about 10 yuan and five jiao. It was reported that Yingfeng Heng Zengyu had over 800 taels, with an additional 11 yuan. Swap transactions were inactive, generally with shorts paying 1.5 to 2 yuan. As a result, Yingfeng Heng opened 105 spot bids for the Central Bank, with a price of only 975 yuan, about 2 yuan lower than the spot gold price.</p>
<p>In market trading, sellers were more active. Overall, Shunli Wanxing Yuqing Yong Tongtaichang Hengxingyuan Hanhang Huixiang Xianghe Hengchang Yi Fengyong and others were on the buying side. Yuanyi Yongli Daxing Yong Shengda Yong De Fuxing Yong Hengtai Dingkang Hengyu Fu An Dingchang Yongfeng Dakang Futai Heng Yi Cheng Bingxing and others were on the selling side.

The market eased, and HSBC announced its rates, with British currency flat and the US currency rising 125. Associated Press telegraphed unfavorable news such as the US government issuing huge amounts of public bonds and purchasing silver, causing the domestic market to be extremely weak. However, due to bank purchases, the forward market was able to turn flat after easing. Thereafter, the situation was uncertain, and the night market silver price decreased by 25. However, the exchange market was particularly stable.

<p>Bank Closure and Reopening; Silver Dollar Collection and Release; Special Increase in Tensions</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of business after the entire banking system was closed for three days. All the procedures for four days of collection and release were handled in one day, and the day's affairs were unusually tense, and the amount of inflow and outflow was enormous. However, the difference between inflow and outflow mostly showed a moderate shortage, and the beginning cushion also felt sufficient. As a result, the exchange rate for silver splitting, initially with added water, also had no market price and was all cleared in white. However, the transaction of split notes was slightly more than last week. As for the money shops, the inflow and outflow procedures, as the banks were closed for the previous few days while the money shops remained the same, the procedures were still not very tense after yesterday's reopening, but there were more public orders. Split note transactions: over 4.1 million were transferred in the morning market, over 400,000 were newly traded, and over 200,000 were traded in the afternoon market. The total transaction in the small association was over 300,000, the silver mortgage transaction was over 900,000, and over 1.5 million was newly made.</p>
<p>Bank collection and release: foreign banks collected and released over 5 million in notes, various goods and foreign exchange mortgages and other collections and releases were 5.89 million, settlement and supplement was over 1.8 million, and warehousing was 1 million. Chinese banks collected and released over 4.67 million in notes, various goods, foreign exchange tax mortgages, and other collections and releases were over 6.1 million, settlement and supplement was over 1.5 million, and warehousing was 500,000. Japanese banks collected and released over 3.56 million in notes, various goods and foreign exchange mortgages and other collections and releases were over 5.2 million, settlement and supplement was over 1.2 million, and warehousing was 800,000. Money shops collected and released over 5.1 million in silver public orders, over 9.2 million in silver transfer funds, over 90,000 in various remittance funds, and over 100,000 in cash.</p>
<p>Also, the total number of exchanges in the city's clearing house on the 4th was 17,373,230.25 silver dollars, including 11,778,450.99 silver dollars and 5,594,779.26 silver dollars for remittance clearing.</p>
<p>Silver Coin Approved for June</p>
<p>New Coin 7.31 Million Yuan; Factory Bars Over 5,000</p>
<p>The Central Mint's Inspection Committee issued Bulletin No. 13 the day before yesterday, stating that the 7.31 million yuan of new coins of the 23rd year sent by the Central Mint for inspection in June of this year have been inspected by the committee-appointed chemist Ge Laide in accordance with regulations. The fineness and weight were found to be in compliance with the Silver Standard Coinage Regulations, and certificates were issued from (23)00924 to (23)02385, a total of 1,462 certificates. In addition, a type of factory bar (880 fineness) cast by the Central Mint in June, from number 21272 to 26490, totaling 5,219 bars, was also "supervised and stamped" by the committee-appointed chemist Ge Laide in accordance with regulations when "checking the standard mark". The fineness and weight of each bar were listed and registered. In addition to being approved for separate delivery from the factory, the detailed table is attached and promulgated for public knowledge. (The table is omitted)</p>
<p>Interest Rate for June Set at Two Yuan</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, the Money Industry Association's Standing Committee proposed the interest rate for June. The full committee decided that it would remain the same as in May, at 2 yuan and 95 deductions. The reason was that the total amount of foreign splits in this month's statistics was 207 points, and with the addition of one day off on the 16th (i.e., the abolished lunar Dragon Boat Festival), 8 points should be added. As such, there should be 2 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, which could reasonably be set at 2 yuan, 5 jiao and 95 deductions. However, as the initial cushion was sufficient and lending was difficult, the money shops would feel at a disadvantage if the market price was used to determine the rate. Therefore, it was decided to remain at 2 yuan, which was only slightly advantageous and only a small amount. As for overdue interest, it would still be set at 4 yuan and 5 jiao, with further increments. As such, the highest price would still be 10 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Guangdong Small Dollars Decline; Copper Coins Decrease Again</p>
<p>In recent days, the market conditions for subsidiary coins, although transactions were not smooth, the market prices often fluctuated greatly, especially for Jiangnan small foreign coins. Yesterday, it was relatively calm, mainly because people were mostly lazy in the hot summer. Yesterday's morning and afternoon market prices for Jiangnan small foreign coins were both 835 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the afternoon market price the day before. Only 2,000 jiao were transacted in the morning market, and there were no transactions in the afternoon market. The morning market price for Guangdong small foreign coins was 732 yuan, and the afternoon market price was 731 yuan, a decrease of 1 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the day before. 50,000 jiao were transacted in the morning market, and 15,000 jiao were transacted in the afternoon market. Copper coins decreased by 3,000 wen, to 327,000 wen, and 25,179 strings were transacted, equivalent to 7,700 silver dollars.</p>
<p>Few People at Securities Meeting; Trading Reduced; Bond Market Shows Uneven, Fluctuating Pattern</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange will begin its summer vacation of four weeks today</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for public bonds at the Chinese Securities Exchange did not change much despite being closed for three days. The market situation was stable, as most of the floating longs and shorts had prepared in advance, and there were no problems in the environment. The bombing after the opening of the railway was an accident and insignificant. However, the market price was too high, and there were many who were bearish. Therefore, some were shorting, and the weather was very hot, so fewer people attended the meeting, and transactions also gradually decreased. The market price was therefore fluctuating, but the environment did not give the shorts an opportunity. For example, the establishment of the Construction Bank Company, the increased hope after the reform of the tariff rate, and the continued cooperation between the Southwest and the Central government were not conducive to the shorts. Therefore, after a period of fluctuation, there was still hope for upward movement.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the morning opening, most prices were up by 2 or 3 cents. After entering the market, especially after the customs supervision, most prices were up by 1 or 2 cents. The trend was distorted, and the fluctuating situation was already formed. In the second session, various front-row items were back up by 2 or 3 cents, while Jin Duan, Zheng Liu, and others were down by 1 or 2 cents. The afternoon sessions were particularly chaotic, with some rising and others falling, and most could not be consistent. The difference between the high and low prices fluctuated between 5 cents and 1 jiao and 5 fen. Large households rarely entered or exited. Numbers 5 and 23 were bought more, and the rest were insignificant. As a result, market prices showed both high and low, only 2 or 3 cents apart. The total number of transactions was 11.76 million yuan.</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Up and Down</p>
<p>This company, Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (the 3rd) the New York Stock Market was extremely deserted. The next day was the American Independence Day, and the exchange did not open as usual. However, because wheat and important special products were firm, and commercial news was favorable to the longs, such as the number of businesses that went bankrupt in June of this year was less than last year, the market situation turned flat and morale improved. Gold and silver stocks rose because traders were optimistic about the future of gold and silver. Transportation stocks eased because the government will investigate telephones, telegrams, and radio in preparation for formulating management laws. The small exchange and bonds were dull and uneven. US bonds were firm, while German bonds rebounded slightly. Wheat initially rose because of poor news about foreign fields and crops, including locust plagues in Argentina, but then fell because longs took profits. Tomorrow (the 4th), the US markets and exchanges will be closed. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 400,000. According to the New York agent, (securities) the market was almost stagnant because it would be closed the next day. (Wheat) Because the harvest was greatly reduced and industry insiders were bullish, the market price should rise in the coming days. Some people bought when the price fell. (Corn) It is advisable to buy when the price falls. (Cotton) The market situation is firm. The small rains in Texas did not help much. Industry insiders bought slightly. Shorts recently sold out and are engaging in short covering. Raw cotton is sluggish and prices are firm. (Rubber) Prices are firm because of strength in major markets and reduced exports from Malaya in June. Most buyers are brokers. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>

<p>Yarn: Thin Consumer Power for Raw Yarn; Standard Sentiment Inclined to Selling</p>
<p>The yarn market is still weak, and the situation is quite soft. Because the sales of raw yarn are depressed, and various trading groups have no purchasing actions, morale is weak. Although US cotton has rebounded, the actual situation is not good, so there are few buyers. Longs see the situation as unfavorable and sell to close positions, and the market turns downward.</p>
<p>Jinji Market: Shortage of Sellers</p>
<p>The opening of the yarn bidding market was slightly bullish due to the rise in US cotton, but there were not many buyers in the market, and the situation was not very bullish. Prices rose 3 to 4 jiao for each month, and then fell back during the second and third rounds of bidding. As a result, prices rose 1, 2, and 3 jiao for each month. In the afternoon, it was reported that sales of raw yarn were sluggish, and the market became weaker. Prices fell 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 jiao for each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,400 bales. Renfeng sold 1,350 bales, Yuanyi 700 bales, Huachang 400 bales, Xinhua 300 bales, Dafu 300 bales, Senkang 300 bales, and Taixing 400 bales. Yuanda bought 400 bales, Huikang 350 bales, Shenchang 450 bales, Yuande 400 bales, and Taichang 300 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day and the closing price are listed below.</p>

<p>Total 333,000</p>
<p>Raw Yarn Market Increasingly Quiet</p>
<p>Sales of raw yarn remained sluggish. According to statistics, various trading groups purchased only 390 bales for the entire day. The market was flat. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Mainland 130</p>
<p>Guangdong 65</p>
<p>Changsha 5</p>
<p>Sichuan 150</p>
<p>Ningbo 5</p>
<p>Nanjing 15</p>
<p>Counterparts 20</p>
<p>The cotton market trended weaker. Because sales of raw cotton were not smooth, and many factories reduced or stopped work, the demand for raw cotton decreased. Therefore, although US cotton rose, morale was still difficult to stimulate. The price of old cotton fell more sharply, but the price of new cotton rose slightly because the weather was too dry and longs absorbed the amount and were reluctant to loosen their grip. However, according to news from various sources, the cotton acreage increased by about 3% to 35% compared to last year. Longs closed positions in the Zheng Bidding market.</p>
<p>Zheng Bidding market opened slightly higher due to US cotton's gains, but was weakened by large long selloffs and a shortage of buyers. As a result, prices rose slightly by five cents to one jiao for each month. In the afternoon, market sentiment weakened significantly as longs closed out positions and news indicated a potential drop in US cotton prices the following day. Consequently, prices fell by two to three jiao for each month. The total trading volume for the day was 49,300 dan. Yuanda sold 1,000 dan, Yichang 1,000 dan, Tongji 2,000 dan, Changyu 1,100 dan, Xiecheng 1,800 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,600 dan, and Changhe 1,000 dan. Tongxing bought 1,200 dan, Xiecheng 1,400 dan, Yuanda 1,900 dan, Yukang 1,100 dan, Changfeng 2,900 dan, Xincheng 2,100 dan, Gengfeng 900 dan, and Dafu 900 dan.

<p>Total 760,100</p>
<p>Factory Demand is Sparse</p>
<p>Spot cotton business is lackluster, and factories are buying very little. The sources include 140 bales of Yao cotton and 180 bales of Tong cotton. The current cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton 41.75 Yongan Factory Purchase 200 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Bao Cotton 55.00 Yongan Factory Purchase 246 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>US Cotton Rises Due to Drought</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton prices rose due to reduced selling, lack of rain in drought areas, and positive news from Liverpool. As a result, spot prices rose 20 points, and futures prices rose 17 to 19 points. British cotton futures rose 2 points. Indian cotton firmed due to purchases and short covering by European exporters. As a result, Pingguoer fell 1 rupee, Aomula fell 7.5 jiao, and Bailuoxi fell half a rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 3rd):</p>

<p>The Current Status of Tianjin Cotton Production is Good</p>
<p>The New Cotton Acreage Has Increased by 2/10ths to 3/10ths Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>A Tianjin dispatch reports that cotton market prices in Xihé have been fluctuating recently, but compared to a month ago, the price has risen. US cottonseed cotton is especially firm, and cotton merchants seem to have a new development opportunity. However, according to news from various production areas along the Xiyu River, market prices are higher than in Tianjin. Spot goods are sold out, but there is still no profit. According to a private investigation report on the cotton acreage in various cotton-producing areas in Xiyu River this</p>
<h3>New Cabinet's Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The policy for forming the new Okada cabinet has been decided. To prepare for the crisis of 1935-1936, national defense and diplomacy should be the top priority. On the one hand, political parties must still be respected. Talented individuals from both the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties, as well as from all other sectors, should be recruited to create what is called a unified national coalition cabinet. As for policies, they will generally resemble those of the Saitō cabinet, with particular emphasis on discipline. Regarding the selection of cabinet members, General Okada certainly has his own ideas. Today, it is said that he and former Prime Minister Saitō have already discussed the matter and that some former cabinet members will likely be reappointed. Within the Navy, there is a generally favorable sentiment towards General Okada forming the cabinet. This is because the next Naval Disarmament Conference will be held next year, and the weaknesses in the actual strength of the Japanese Navy must be eliminated. Furthermore, we are currently in the two-year budget period for compiling the Second Replenishment Plan. In such a critical situation, having a Navy elder of high character form the cabinet will allow the Navy to have a prime minister who understands the Navy's overall intentions and can support it with the overall situation. It is said that everyone should unite to bring the crisis of 1935-1936 to an end. (4th Jiji News Agency)</p>
