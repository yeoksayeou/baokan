<p>時評中國敎育學會所得之感想　廷·　　中國敎育學會。於去年一月舉行第一屆年會於上海。本月二十五日舉行第二屆年會於首都。在今內憂外患紛至沓來之期内。從事人士。能聚精會神。討論今後敎育事業之大計。不可謂非可喜之一事。吾人披覧連日所提出討論之諸議題。類多切實扼要。而於其討論中心之各题中。關於『組織民族精神敎材委員會」及「實施生產敎育」兩題尤爲切合於時勢之需要而不可一日緩者。今後全國和敎育家。不視此議案爲會塲上之空談。而能握住此兩點繼續努力。悉心研究。獲得實施適當之方法則我國敎育前途。必有光明之發展。而明年第三屆開會時更必有成績可觀也。　　　我國辦理新敎育已有數十年之久。而一旦九一八外患襲來。全國束手。甚至國難時期。綿延迄今。猶未底止。而國人對於恢復失土一事。曾加切實研究者甚鮮。卽時時以國難爲念而努力宣傳者。亦不在多數。如此事實。不能認爲民族精神之不振。農村衰落。工商業停頓。失業人數逐漸增加。如此事實。又不能不認爲生產敎育之失敗。自九一八後。我國敎育界中有識之士。固亦嘗懲前毖後。都覺『民族復興』與『生產敎育』二者。爲吾國今後辦理敎育之方針。此誠爲對症下藥之要圖。惟如何能實踐此目標。而獲得預期之效果。則尙有待於爲全國師表之敎育界之共同努力。中國敎育學會以研究敎育爲其主要職能。對此關係國家民族生死存亡之重大使命。自必有『責無旁貸義不容辭』之感。其猶待商榷者。卽爲如何完成此使命應採之途徑也。　　吾人深覺我國新敎育之所以失敗。實由於社會環境之惡劣。受封建勢力之重重壓迫而莫由擺脫。復加以連年政治局面之不安定。而過去敎育界之辦敎育者。又爲『以敎育而辦敎育。』離開現實的社會與政治。而自成一集團。於是政政汉不穏定。社會愈惡劣。而敎育亦愈無出路。今日以『民族復興』與『生產敎育』相號召者。殆於此亦有所覺悟歟。　　就『民族復興』與『生產敎育』兩事而言。欲中華民族之復興。必先使搆成此民族之各個分子。皆能認識其所處地位之危險。其方法當自普及敎育着手。然今日封建思想尙盤旋於普通人士之腦海。以爲受敎育乃『士大夫』階級之特有權利。而『士大夫』之所以受敎育。又不外爲出仕做官之凖備。隠然以敎育程度之高下。而劃成治者與被治者間之鴻溝。官僚政治於產生。可見封建思想不摧毁。敎育不普及。而高談民族復興。無異『缘木求魚。』　　生產敎育之目的消極方面。在打破我國封建社會蔑視勞動之傳統敎育思想。積極方面。則在養成全國人民手腦並用之能力。我國以天賦之厚。人口之衆。宜可家饒户足。何以今日多數人民衣食無着。反有凍餒之虞吾人嘗從經濟立塲觀察。實因消費者多。生產者少。而消費與生產者。不得平衡爲今之計除謀政治改進外。當融洽敎育與勞働於一爐。一方面使全國學生了解勞働之眞義。生產之重要。不致再受官僚政治之引诱。他方面對於目不識丁之農工。則給以從事生產之新智識。幷培植其民族意志。則國家建設卽可添得手腦並用之千百萬生力軍矣。　　中國敎育學會諸君。旣注意於已往敎育失敗之癥結所在。而力圖補救。其　　道要在竭力使育敎與現實的社會與政治相接近。納政治於正軌。謀社會之改善。然後以復興民族提倡生產爲標榜之新敎育。乃得有孕育母體發榮滋長之一日也。登臺纔兩月　法旭丹內閣總辭職　　（赫里歐繼起組閣有望　巴黎保王黨起大暴動）　　(巴黎）　本日下午三時十分、內閣舉行會議、散會後、發表公報內稱、總理旭當於開會時、對閣僚說明司法部長雷那第辭職之原因、謂雷氏因五年以前之薩加桑信託公司案、被人攻撃、自請辭職、恢復自由、以便自行辯護、此事與斯逹维斯基案無關、旭當對雷氏辭職、業已接受、旋卽考慮政局、以爲政府之行動、最近尙受參衆兩院大多數之贊成、本可繼續執行職務、第與論混亂之時、司法部長又行引退、内閣欲於沉靜空氣之中盡其責任、更感困難、因此旭當向閣僚主張内閣全體辭職、俾總統另選閣揆、組織新閣、以求行政及精神上之振作、並得保障共和政制、全體閣員均贊成旭當之主張、全體閣員當於下午四時四十五分齊赴總統府、向勒蒲侖總統提出内阁總辭職書、按旭當係於上年十一月二十七日繼薩勞之後組織内閣者、距今僅兩月之久、（二十七日哈瓦斯）　　（巴黎）　政府辭職及旭丹谢絕總統請其再組新閣後、急進社會黨領袖赫禮歐似將出任總揆、逹拉第原有被選之望、但因社會黨反對、故遂作罷、現信總統在星期一日以前、不致召見新總理、至現政府辭職之理由、曾由旭丹以公報布告、略謂目前公共生活咸爲史逹维斯基舞弊案及因以發生之政治騷動所控制、故渠乃建議政府應辭職、俾新政府嚴正實施司法行政與道德的改革、卽經全閣一致贊成云、（二十七路透電）開始組閣磋商　　（巴黎）　旭當内閣辭職後、勒蒲侖總統於今晨開始作政治磋商、前總理泰狄歐於九點二十五分乘汽車晋總統府、卽由總統延見、急停黨領袖赫禮歐則於九點五十五分至、逾二分鐘泰狄歐出總統府、向報界宣言、謂鄙意解决目前政潮、僅有一法、卽組織範圍儘量寛泛之舉國一致内閣、而以一新人物出任總揆、其理由有二、一爲一般的、一爲特殊的、惟此種舉國一致内閣、方能應付目前之三種任務、此三種任務、卽（一）清除貪汚、（二）通過預算案、（三）於必要時解散國會是也云云、十點二十五分、前總理巴爾都入總統府、赫禮歐則於十點四十五分出府、未作何種宣言、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）巴黎王黨暴動　　（巴黎）　旭丹内閣昨夜全體辭職、已引起近年來罕見之重大暴動與巷鬥、巴黎全城頓呈革命之狀態、蓋有保王黨紛在各街𢬌去樹木、搗碎玻璃窗與公共報架、並縱火把噪行於各大街、阻斷交通、而與警察發生衝突、被捕者數百人、傷者無數、旭丹因恐星期二日在衆院中討論史達維斯基舞弊案時、遭遇失敗、故絕計總辭職、當向總統勒白倫提出辭呈時、總統加以慰留、並請另組新閣、經旭丹謝絕、於是總統乃商諸參衆兩院議長、兩議長請以揆赫赫畀赫禮歐、如赫辭謝或組閣不成、則此席將屬諸現閣陸長達拉第、旭丹內閣之辭職未卽宣布、保王黨初未知之、乃集合納稅人數百及少數共產黨於午後晚間作示威運動、並有示威者五千人、在劇場街與警察衝突、結果被捕下獄者百餘人、消息已播、全城混亂、保王黨與共和包圍團在各街道苦鬥不已、雖由包圍團以警棍衝散、而屢散屢聚、直至午夜始漸安靖、惟城心大街有四千餘警察與保衛團來往梭巡、致使全城具軍營之氣象、（二十八日國民電）法國里昂商會　抵制日貨運動·里昂　里昂商會今日一致通過决議案、要求禁止不簽定列有基本條件之公約各國輸運貨品入法、主席郁萊爾宣稱、日貨之競爭、乃生死問題、較之傾銷、爲禍尤烈、蓋以其侵迫實甚也、該决議案要求在國際條約訂定之際、限制運入法國與殖民地之日貨、（二十八日路透電）日人在南美活動　　美國特殊注意　　（華盛頓）日本商務考察團在智利調查一舉、使美國政府更注意於日本在拉丁美洲活動情形、政府各機關業由各處接獲多種報告、其一係由古巴方面寄來者、說明最近日本對古巴政治問題極感興趣、日本公使館收容古巴失意政客、並護送上船、逃往外國、新有日本移民四百人至古巴之杉島上、加瑪蓋省境内日本移殖事業、亦日益擴展、此外關於南美各國境内日貨傾銷情形、此間亦接有報告、又聞秘魯及巴拿馬兩國航空聘日本人敎綀、去年三月間巴西國政府曾向日本政府建議、由日本船廠代造軍艦三十艘、而以巴西所產之咖啡及錳暨他種貨物、抵償造價、並已於十二月間在東京開始磋商價格、最近經美國政府交涉、結果巴西已允取消項此項建議云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）希特勒　反對復辟主義　　（鋼盔團歸併國社黨　保皇勢力式微）　　（柏林）　國社黨與保皇黨間之緊張、已臻極度、保皇黨由航空部長兼普魯士邦總理戈林助之張目、現努力奮鬥、但顯已失勢、昨夜全國軍官聯合會會員慶祝德皇七十五歲生辰時、爲警察馳往解散、今日退伍軍人聯合會長國權黨郝恩將軍已由國社黨健將李恩哈德大佐代之、當局並下令將鋼盔團完全入國社黨、團員必須棄其舊日之灰色外褂、而改衣國社黨之褐衫、同時各報均自由抨擊復辟主義、（二十七日路透電）長崎渡輪覆沒　　（三百餘人遭溺斃）　　·長崎　今日市渡船朝日丸載南岸船廠與機器廠散工之工人回鎭、在北岸、午後五時二十分該船將靠近碼頭時、因載人過衆、致覆沉港中、溺斃者逾三百人、該船僅四十九噸、註冊能載一百六十八人、此次所載估計逾三百五十人、如果確實、則溺斃者有三百三十九人、因獲生者僅十一人也、死者多屬三菱造船廠之工人、聞當局將澈查此案、豫料市政官員數人將因以辭職、續電、朝日丸溺斃之人數、尙未查明、但似不若初料之多、現有三十人因受凍與傷臥於醫院中、迄今僅撈獲屍骸五具、（二十八日路透電）煩慮過度可致瘋痴　　（纽約）　著名纽約心理學家西堡立氏聲稱、煩慮乃趨向發痴也第一步、據統計家估計、在過去十年中神經錯亂者增多百分之三十、如此種增加速度繼續不减、則在二一三九年世界之人將無一非瘋漢、渠望唯利是圖烦思不已者知所警惕云、（二十八日路透電）石瑛暫不離京　　（南京）　石瑛離職有打銷說、暫不離京繼續維持、（廿八日專電）馬仲英又圖襲迪化　　●　巴克提　此間接訊、馬仲英忽破壞與迪化省府之休戰談判、深夜襲擊迪化城、旋爲省軍擊退、馬仲英已得援軍、彼擬圍攻迪化城及其要塞、（二十七日塔斯電）盧江福山開採明礬　　（南京）　實業部以安徽盧江福山產明礬頗富、歷經人民私採製造出售、迄未依法呈請取得礦權、該省建設應遵部令轉飭依法呈請、現已彙齊送部、請發給採礦執照、（廿八日專電）軍委會總顧問易人　　（南京）　軍委會總顧問德人韋彩兩將返國任職、聞蔣委長已聘定德國前國防部長昔克特繼任、最近將由歐來華任職、（二十八日專電）軍委會設四省邊區公路處　　（南京）　軍委會設立四省邊區公路處、修築邊區重要公路、以利剿匪、以曾養甫爲處長、組織條例十一條、經蔣委長核定、（二十八日專電）工廠檢察查處組安全衛生研委會　　（南京）　中央工廠檢查處組織安全衛生研究委員會、委員定十一人、至十三人、並擬具安全衛生調理規程、定三十日開專家會議審查、（二十八日專電）軍部提倡國貨　　（南京）　軍部所發各種運輸護照、向用外國道林紙印刷、漏巵極大、茲自二十三年起、改用國產皮紙、以示提倡國貨、（二十八日中央社電）周駿彥到京請財部補助浙財政　　（南京）　浙財聽長周駿彥二十八到京、據談、此來係因浙財政每年不敷約百數十萬、擬請財部每月酌予補助、（二十八日專電）程其保談鄂省敎費　　（南京）　程其保談、鄂省敎費獨立、將中央每月補助鄂省之二十萬元在鄂省中央稅收項下直接撥付、以作省敎育經費、並特組敎育經費保管委員會、使其完全獨立、已呈中央核辦、由張主席與當局接洽中、王世杰部長亦示贊同云、（二十八日專電）旅京閩同鄉請通緝何公敢等　　（南京）　閩旅京同鄉會電蔣委長陳海長、慰勞平定閩亂諸將領、並電最高法院鄭檢察長、請通緝叛逆爪牙何公敢林植夫黃瑞陳耀焜等、依法懲辦、（二十八日專電）生物展覽會開幕　　（南京）　生物研究所生物展覽會二十九日在成賢街文德里開幕、展覽期兩星期、（二十八日專電）滬國難宣傳團到京　　（南京）　滬國難宣傳團一行六人、二十八日抵京、定內北上、實地宣傳、（二十八日專電）中央將令國醫減低診金平抑藥價　　（南京）　中央以中醫診金及藥費定價甚昂、一般貧病者往往無力治療、擬明令全國醫館、將診金减低藥價平抑、以惠病民、（二十八日專電）鎮江人力車夫復工　　（鎮江）　鎮黃包車夫二十八午後五時齊復工、、由各機關决定解决辦法五項、一、車租每日减去五分、二、肇事代表由警備部處罰、三、被破壞汽車由肇事者賠償、四、嚴厲取締無照人力車、五、聯運車聽客乘坐、（二十八日專電）故宮古物開始點騐　　（北平）　故宮古物、二十四日起、開始點騐、行政院派周傳經到場監點、（二十八日專電）綏包兩地商務不振　　（北平）　歸化電、綏包兩地因商務不振、舊曆年關邇、勢難維持、綏包兩商會分向省府呼籲、請求救濟、傳作義允由平市官錢局借給包頭商會洋四萬元、借給綏商會三十萬元、由錢業公會調濟市面、（二十八日專電）李書華翁文灝赴陝　　（北平）　李書華‧翁文灝‧定二十八日晚赴陝、代表平研究院出席西北考古會成立大會、該會係二月一日在西安舉行、（二十八日中央社電）中興沉輪打撈無效　　（天津）　航行大連天津間日商大連株式會社商輪中興號、二十五夜十二時滿載木料、距大沽口外五十海里處、左舷觸巨大冰塊、沉默、貨物悉失、旅客百餘以舢板救出、用木料結筏登其上、當該船將沉時、發信號求救、行

<p>（虧耗多而獲利少）</p>
<p>（現行江輪有百艘）</p>
<p>（日船减四分之三）</p>
<p>去年滬上百業不振、而尤以航輪公司爲最、無讑外洋、近海以及長江·内河·而能维持原狀、不受虧折者、已屬不易、各輪公司中、大致虧損者居多卽航路中最佳之長江綫、上年亦發生船多貨少、噸位過剩之局面、滬上經營此綫、厥以六公司之營業最巨、茲將各公司之上年營業狀况、分述如下、</p>
<p>（招商局）</p>
<p>招商局之長江航輪、爲主要的基本幹綫、共有頭等江輪四艘、二等船七艘、分駛上下游三綫、其長江路行走滬漢班者、上年在六公司會議减船之際、乃將江天·江裕·兩船、出租與中央、作爲差用之船、又將江靖輪、賃與大逹、改駛通揚、而常川往來、行班之船、祗有六艘、其峨嵋與快利、則航上游也、上年長江航業、自經該局厲行分局實報實銷、各船取締稍包、漁桶收歸局中收費以後、水脚大增、向來於六公司中占第三位者、乃躍居第一位惟峨嵋失事、損失逹十餘萬元、遂使京漢特快班、無法行駛、然統盤核計、該局之江輪、猶可獲利也、依照船舶科之原意、須增建新江輪三艘、加入長江、另建五百噸者兩艘、擴充上游、第今次庚欵造輪、會議結果、長江船亦祗可增建兩艘、大致本年秋季之後、方可擴充發展也</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>讀書的根本問題　（二）</h3>
<p>（（二）讀書的無系統）</p>
<p>我從二十歲上脫離了學校後（中學一年级），就到社會上去混。遇着一些他人所遇不着的奇怪事，受到一些不堪的苦楚，也得了些他人所得不到的經騐·，在這樣的環境中，促成我對於人生想求得一個深切了解的大願。因此，哲學史，侖理學，思想史……之類的書，看了許多，一方面自己也常常去思考，然而却總不能把我親身體騐到的，及看書得來的一些零零碎碎的見聞整理起來，成爲一種有體係的一贯思想。有時在心裏回味着，也像結成了形體，及至寫出來或說出來時，却又不是那樣了。</p>
<p>後來自己加以考察儗，以爲這是我的思想沒經鍜鍊，所以沒有條理。如要思想有條理，須有鍜鍊思想的工具。於是就想研究幾何·，研究邏輯。却因沒有指導，終是闖不進那邏輯之門。先生們想想，這是多麽苦啊！……（陳子元來信）</p>
<p>我是一個中學還沒有畢業的靑年，五年前就離開了學校，到社會上找飯吃了。我的學問的基礎旣然沟有打好，那麽，我自學的能力也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>我自幼就愛讀小說，好像愛好「文學」是我生就的天性似的。五年前，我開始讀新文藝的書籍，後來因爲感到僅讀文學書是不够用的，於是開始讀「社會科學」書，每天平均要讀二百多面，在半年裏，我讀了好幾十本書·，可是因爲我並不曾仔細地一本一本地精讀，也不曉得「讀書方法」，所以得到的效果自然是很微細的。現在，我希望先生肯給我以詳明的指示，問題是：「怎樣研究文學」？「怎樣研究社會科學」？（濟南張星舫來信）</p>
<p>………我現在要把我的實際生活與我所發生的困難向你們早訴，要求你們能够給我明確的指示與解答。我每天工作是十個鐘頭，餘暇的時間有五六個鐘頭，一年三百六十天是沒有假放的。我以前在小學唸過書，讀的都是老古書（四書），新文學書却沒有看過。爲着生活我離開小學跑到社會上來了，此後經過失業，流浪，當丘八的痛苦與壓迫。　　因爲不了解生活，不認識這個紛亂的社會現狀，所以，我要研究社會科學來認識這個目前的社會。我是借得了一些書來看，可是，看不懂！理論的書籍看不懂，讑戰的書籍更弄得頭昏。譬如看一本論戰的書籍，究竟那些是對的，那些是不對的，爲什麽不對，這些我完全看不出來，一言以蔽之，我不能理解。爲什麽不能了解呢？這是因爲我的理解力不行，同時也是因沒有得到讀書的方法。（王克强來信）　　這幾位所發生的問題，據我們的推測，大約不外科以下三點，（一）䁽等前進，和讀書無系統（二）選擇讀物不精審和不能把握正確的理論。一言以蔽之，卽讀書沒有遵循正確的路徑。　　關於䁽等前進之不可能和中心思想之重要我們已在「關於選擇科目的幾個問題」及「學說的紛歧與正確理讑的把握」兩文中論及，讀者可再參看，茲不贅述，惟我們從此三種弊病中，我們郤更感覺到基礎知識之重要，和在基礎學識未具之前，卽行分科學習的害處。（結論及辦法在明日公表）</p>

<h3>客滿</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>戲園子裏，一旦名角登臺，或是電影院裏，放映肉感香艷的名片，那不用說，未到開塲揭幕的時刻，早已上上下下擠得座無隙地，水洩不通、而髙髙地在大門口掛起「客滿」的牌子。再如大飯店裏，大舞塲裏，若是輪到了一個洋化的甚麼佳節，不客氣，也會鬧一個「客滿」，而使後至者望門興歎。‧我們的大中華民國　’據我瞧來，到活像一個中華大舞臺，而且正鬧着客滿的恐慌。話說這個中華大舞臺，在前些時，本來是門可羅雀的。自從雅片戰爭之後，哈哈，給人家知道了這家戲園子的角色，果然不錯，於是陸陸續續的都駕臨觀光。先把「五口」的雅座定了去。接着「香港花樓」，「台灣雅座」都包去了。「上海」「漢口」「天津」「靑島」等等包廂正廳的地位，自然，早已有人定好，居然也擠得滿坑滿谷。三四年前，只算是一個太平門的外蒙古，也有人佔據着。前年，從未有人要坐的末排座位，｜｜東四省，也有人髙坐着了。去年，在角裏的九個小櫈子，也你爭我奪的居爲奇貨。這些不算，在窗洞裏，｜｜西藏，新疆，雲南，廣西等處，｜｜還有人探頭探腦地想混進來。其實，在門口，早已掛着「客滿」。若再有人擠進來</p>
<p>，怕不要閙出天大的亂子來，累得臺上要演不成戲，那是何苦？</p>
<p>再說大飯店，那倒與我們這個貴國，也有三分相像。大飯店裏的旅客，是五方雜處，良莠不齊的。我們貴國，也是五方雜處，各國的紳士，以迄於浪人，充乎其斥。若要考查其來歷，那就像大飯店的旅客簿，一本糊塗帳。　　但是話又得說回來。戲園子，大飯店，掛上客滿牌，還有擋駕的功效，我們這個「中華大舞臺」,「中華大飯店」,雖然掛着客滿牌,客却仍舊沒命地望內擠。｜｜這眞是沒辦法的事囉。</p>
<h3>賴氏散錢奇聞</h3>
<p>— 吳淼</p>
<p>本報二十五日雅典電云：「此處有大富翁大實業家名賴麻氏者，今日特發怪癖，自其住它之樓頭，以一百五百及一千特拉格曼（希臘幣名）之鈔幣，向下散播，使路人相爭攫取。此種消息瞬忽傳佈全城，不約而集者千萬人。賴氏並向警士稱，彼對於此種齷齪錢財，深惡痛絕，並謂彼深受阿堵物之累，頗感厭倦」云，這眞是一樁絕世奇聞。</p>
<p>在我國古代，也有厭倦金錢的，如王夷甫口不言錢，其妻令婢以錢繞其床·王夷甫朝起見之曰，舉却阿堵物。此一事也。又如民間傳說云：明代蘇州有大富翁沈萬山，嘗於塔頂飛金，觀衆爭取以爲樂。此又一事也。不過一則自鳴清髙，一則是公子哥兒的豪舉，而賴麻氏的於樓頭散鈔票，據原電說是因爲患神經病，兩者稍有不同罷了。　　賴麻氏確乎非患神經病不可。你想呢，整千整萬的鈔票，是從哪裏來的？原電說賴麻氏是大實業家，旣是大實業家，一定開很多工廠。我們可以想到，在工廠裏面，有成千上萬的男女工人，絞盡血肉，替他製造商品，然後才造成了賴氏的大富。這大批的財富，每一張鈔幣裏面，都夾着血腥的。賴氏實在爲這血腥薰得昏了，還不發神經病怎的？</p>
<p>這血腥不但薰倒了賴氏，正薰壞了全世界的有錢人。我們看，在不久以後，全世界的有錢人，一定都會患着神經病。而現在則在患神經病的開頭了。不但是開頭，而且是很深了。終究有這一天，全世界所有有錢人的鈔票，會整批整批的都搬到了街上。</p>

<h3>無敵播音平議</h3>
<p>（著作郎）</p>
<p>自從無敵播音室提倡國語播音以來，已經成爲無缐電界一種時髦名詞，摩登士女幾有非國語播音不聽之槪。無敵播音室週波九四０，第一日開幕盛况，大小各報均已競載，但其平日節目之精彩動人，尤爲不易羅致，藝術方而，頗有評論價値。茲將第一日節目記之如左：</p>
<p>蔡露茜女士英文教授，口齒清晰，發音正確，從拼音入手，聽者可以從頭學起，極好共課本爲國民英語入門，商務印書館及家庭工業社均有出售。黎錦暉指導下之歌曲，以白虹舟中曲爲最妙曼，胡笳回來罷爲最悽婉。大鼓有十一歲女孩兒富佩華，唱得眞像小黑姑娘，此兒長大，未可限量，楊蓮琴發聲漫浪，令人聽之心動。孫佐臣操琴時，中間忽入不報姓名之票友唱楊宗保（小生）　珠簾寨老生各一段，玉潤珠圓，頗似陳小蝶，電台報告說猜中者可以明日到家庭工業社拿贈品，鄙人當得一份矣。</p>
<p>陳大悲之觀音戲紅樓夢，已入化境，比之紅花瓶小金鋼鑽進步之快，不可以道里計，其中以賈蓉與尤二姐調情爲最妙，標凖國語，此則當之無愧，尤以馬蹄聲爲最神化，初則一馬彳亍，繼而兩馬並行，三乃數馬疾驰，不待說明，而能使聽者了然，說書先生眞被打倒矣，聞觀音戲爲陳大悲與陳小蝶共同發明，並由小蝶全力資助成功，故二陳有一契約，卽觀音戲新編劇本，非經無敵播音者决不先在别處發表，故欲聽眞眞觀音戲，非無敵電台不可得也。</p>
<p>總之黎錦暉歌曲，陳大悲觀音戲，蘇少卿平劇，實爲無敵播音室之三傑，任何電台所不能有，卽有亦具體而微，尤以少卿滿腹戲學音韻别人不可仿造。梅蘭芳博士致開幕辭，謂無敵牌一切所爲，皆能到無敵地步，洵非虛語也，開幕及第一日節目報告，似均爲陳小蝶親口招供，太賢勞矣，第三日播音大鼓之後，忽因機器損壞停止，無敵係假座李樹德堂播音，聽衆受此損失，李氏實負其咎，按李氏爲合肥相國之孫，於機器研究，極有心得，其電台週波九四0確甚清晰，在南京漢口均能收到，但因富星週波太闊，時有擾亂，兩敗俱傷，望電台當局，從速整理爲要。</p>
<h3>東北四連長　張恨水</h3>
<p>（第二十三回）</p>
<p>（創痛難堪凝神聽鼓樂）</p>
<p>（歡情未洽促别到飛符）</p>
<p>他正如此想把人家的閑事抛了開去，那討人厭的聲音，又送進耳朶來了。這回不是軍樂聲，也不是七巧八馬聲，乃是三絃子和小鼓聲，他們家慶賀喜事，在唱大鼓書了。積之在床上翻來覆去，簡直熬到兩三點鐘，才睡安穏了。�</p>
<p>次日起來。那些聲音，已經沒有了。本來想在上午就到南院去的。轉念一想，這可去不得。嫂子只疑我吃醋，我若是今天不走，到顯着昨天不走，是大有原因的了。他如此想着，又在家裏住了兩天，到了第三天，处樣也忍不住，只好搬着行李出門，雇了兩輛人力車子，向到西直門的大道上來。剛一出門，就看到對過大門口，停了一輛汽車，這却是海甸街上不常見的事。心裏纳悶着，自不免向那邊看去，不一會兒的功夫，男男女女，擁出一大羣人來，第一個便是趙自强。他今天不是穿着軍服，乃是長袍馬褂，古銅色的新呢帽，滾着那油亮的緞子邊，胸面前在馬褂紐扣上，揷了一朶紅花，在那喜氣洋洋的臉上，笑着左顧右盼，得意極了。甘積之心裏想着，我是失意的人了，我也把不上去看他得意的臉色，於是掉轉臉來，坐上車子，一迭連聲的催着車夫快拉。那人力車子由汽車邊拉過去的時候，桂枝是剛上汽車。他今天穿了一件粉紅色長旗袍，新剪後燙的頭髮，簇成堆雲式，在頭上繞了一匝紅絲辮，在左耳上紥了一個小小的蝴蝶結兒。右邊鬢下，却斜揷了一枝、紅绒喜字花，一張鵝蛋臉上，塗了鮮紅的胭脂，這一番嬌艷，就更不必提了。（二三二）</p>

<h3>靑年的女偵探</h3>
<p>羅馬尼亞海軍特務機關，最近發現一位輕佻的海軍靑年將校，這位將校是在康士坦要塞內服務，他善於交際，要塞內的官長，都與他很親暱。但是他守身如玉，所以看不出其爲女性。有一天他因急於便溺，某知好的一將校，在厠所外伺候，不料忽有要令召集，那立在厠所外等的將校，怱忙跑停進去，赫然見爲女性，但是因爲知好關係，還不肯吐出實情。後來二人漸漸發生關係，爲機關內的人偵悉，通告司令部，才把該女處分。</p>

<p>法國學界最近發生了一則奇聞說象有上唇。該國科學院富利安博士，解釋象的上唇的意義說：象自從發逹長大的鼻頭以來，就失掉上唇，可是象在母胎內，有像輪廓的上唇，後來在胎败因鼻頭漸漸發逹，那上唇就漸漸缩小退化了，所以小象生時，已經把上唇的痕跡消滅哇。</p>
<h3>不生子起訴訟</h3>
<p>匃牙利人熊克司，與妻結婚後，經過十餘年，祇生了二女。熊氏很想得一個子，常對其妻說道：「假使你再不生一個兒子，那我就要脫離家庭關係了。」妻因其所說，認爲無理，發生衝突，熊遂懹恨而出，其妻訴諸蒲泰彼司德法庭，法官判决道：「在這經濟恐慌的時代，不應當多產兒女，就是以生的二女，已覺得不容易養育，况且生男生女不能專怪女人。」熊氏不服，提起控告，最告法院審判長先命法醫檢查那夫妻二人的精卵，結果認其妻稍有缺點，但是仍舊勸戒熊氏安心，言歸於好。</p>
<h3>勉強接吻受罰</h3>
<p>美國近衛步兵的砲手名呌羅易，派遣到印度。那一日，在大街上看見了一位麗人耐里雪蒙，他勉強拉女接吻，可是麗人很不願意接吻，把他勉強接吻以後，就上告於法庭，但羅易原定於當日就須乘艦出發，因爲要受審理，軍艦也延遲二十四小時起碇，到了第二日，法庭判决羅易罰緩七元，並申誡以後不得勉強拉人接吻。</p>

<h3>英國的生產率</h3>
<p>去年度英國的生產率，爲全歐洲最低之數，死亡率反比前數年爲多，所以現在英國政府，對於人口問題，非常焦急，英國內務部調查，人口一千名，生產率爲一五‧八，而歐洲出產率最低之國，本爲法國，人口一千名，爲一八，德國爲一七‧五，意大利爲二六，英國現今突然低落爲歐洲第一位，遂引起該國當局的憂慮啊。（楚玉）</p>

<h3>醫師之五權</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>往者東昌言醫德，連篇累牘，發表於報章者，旣甚衆矣！同道之士，有心許而首肯者，亦嘗爲文以響應之。惟是醫德云者，醫師應守之規律，應盡之義務耳。天下無只盡義務而無權利之事，茲者全國醫師大會聞會於首都，提案中保障醫權提高醫權之文字匪一，而對於醫權之範圍，則未及明定之，甚可憾也。夫醫德爲醫師應守之信條，醫權爲醫師應存之利益，二者不能缺一，故繼醫德而言醫權。</p>
<p>（一）有開業之權　醫師之目的在於病，而診病則非開業不可，正式醫師，出身正式之學校，受相當學問之培養，故其開業，自無須再經政府之考試，與社會之檢查。蓋其資格學問，已足爲其自由開業之根據，此多數文明國家之普通情形也。若其出身幷非正式，則與江湖術士同科，跡近歛財，行同欺詐，非獨無自由開業之權，且爲政府社會所必須取締。故開業者，爲正式醫師特有之權利也。</p>
<p>（二）有加入公會之權　同道之間，有應守之信條，互相遵守，而後醫事之糾紛可弭，醫業之進步可期。公會之設，固在於聯絡同道之感情，謀醫業之進步，而明定其規律，以爲同道遵守之資，則尤重要之條件也。故在一地方之開業醫師，爲保持個人之權利，與不侵犯他人之權利起見，實有加入公會之必要，而公會亦有令其加入之必要。惟加入之條件，則以正式醫師爲限，非正式醫師，根本卽無開業之權利，正式醫師之集團，當亦無加入之可能矣！故加入公會者，亦正式醫師所特有之權利也。</p>
<p>（三）有接收診金之權　枵腹從公，世無此理，故接收診金，爲醫歸應有之權利，夫生命爲無代價之物，醫師之診看，一方費無限之精神，一方負無限之責任，而對於病人之關心，决不减於病人之家屬，些微之診金，在醫者受之，僅爲勞苦之報酬，在病者視之，則不得謂爲生命之代價卽止於是也。乃一般病者，往往以不会診金爲榮，或以爲旣付診金，則對於醫師之義務已盡。不知診金旣爲醫師所應有，若吝而不付，則無異於資竊行爲，昔賢有言，「不付診金斯爲賊，」誠至言也。故醫師對於病者，若不付診金，可直接索取，可訴諸法律�</p>
<p>，而法律對於此種病人，亦須加以嚴厲之處罰，始足以服人心而保醫對。雖然，此就正式醫師言之也。若非正式醫師，則欺詐取財，無所不可，病人不付診金，則正所以懲戒之。藎本非醫師，當然無索取診金之權也。</p>
<p>（四）有保持病人之權　醫師診治病人，負無限之責任，故醫師當視病人爲自己之所有物，而病人則亦當自視爲醫師之所有物。病家固不得私自易醫，同道亦不得私自攘取。醫師特有之權利，卽在於保持病人，藎必如此而後始能負責，始足以盡治療之能事。若病家朝秦暮楚，始甲終乙，則醫師之責任無從負也。故醫師於病家來診之先，可鄭重聲明此點，若病家不能遵守，則寗可拒絕於前。而同道有意攘奪，則亦訴諎公會也。至於非正式醫生，則病人之就診者，係出於一時之誤會，若覺而他往，正如入迷途者中道而返，而正式醫師之接受此項病人，亦正如指迷津，登彼岸，與攘奪正式同道之病人未可同日語也。</p>
<p>（五）有介紹藥品之權　售藥者商，用藥者醫，爲杜一二藥商之銷售劣藥起見，於是醫師乃有介紹藥品之特權。年來外藥傾銷，抵制無法，本權之實施，乃爲當前之急務矣！本市醫師有新藥審查委員會組織，卽爲實行本權之先河，非經本會審審查後介紹之藥品，不在良藥之列。蓋如是而後人民之生命始有所保障，外溢之權利始可挽回，而操此權者則非醫家莫辦也。</p>
<p>總理言憲法有五權，而醫師之權利其犖犖大者亦有五。而此五權者非正式醫師莫屬焉！本此五權以爲規定醫師法之根據，或亦政府立法當局所樂許者歟</p>
<h3>人體腸寄生蟲之危害驅除及預防（三）</h3>
<p>— 蔣本沂</p>
<p>（慈航助産學校　亞洲中學　講演稿）</p>
<p>（（戊）縧蟲病）</p>
<p>縧蟲是腸寄生蟲中最長最大的一種。有十心尺到二十尺以上的長徑。形狀和蛔蟲等大不相同，是一種由頭部長頸和許多片節連成的扁薄如帶的蟲大所以又呌做帶蟲。縧蟲的第個片節，都是個獨立的生活體，具備着雌雄兩性，能够自己蕃殖起來。有時候，牠後段的片節往往自己脫下來，跟糞便一同排出。</p>
<p>縧蟲病和别的腸寄生蟲病一樣當然也逃不了胃腸障礙，好像食慾不振，噯氣，惡心，腹部常有壓重感。這種症候，往往因爲吃了葱，韮，大蒜，鹹魚等東西而厲害起來。反之，吃了牛乳雞蛋和脂肪性的食物，那末，諸症輕快，病症厲害的時候，也有頭痛眩暈，躁狂發作，譫妄等神經症狀，甚至發生視爲障礙，聽力障礙，强度貧血，心跳厲害，呼吸困難等。</p>
<p>（己）薑片蟲</p>
<p>薑片蟲的形狀，和上面幾種大不相同，牠不是長圓如綫，也不是扁薄如帶，而有一種像薑片似的固有形態，所以呌做薑片蟲。</p>
<p>薑片蟲有二十四粍到二十七粍的長徑，五·五粍到十四粍的腹徑，是一種屬於地方性的腸寄生蟲病，咱們中國的南部數省和揚子江流域非常流行；尤其是在浙江省的紹興和蕭山兩縣鬧得更凶。據調查蕭山全縣小學生生薑片蟲病的有九十％；換句話說，在蕭山，每一百個小學生中，九十個是有薑片蟲病的，這眞是駭人聽聞的記載！　　薑片蟲病的症候分急性的和慢性的兩種。急性的是嘔吐，血性下痢，下腹部膨大，發熱，黄疸病等。要是這蟲子長時間寄生着，那末身體發育大受障礙，生殖腺的發育，也比較健康的人慢得多所以生這種病的孩子，很不容易發育起來，老是像個侏儒般的矮子，這是本病特有的症候。</p>
<h3>（四）腸寄生蟲的診斷治療和簡易預防法</h3>
<p>腸寄生蟲的種旣句這樣多，腸寄生蟲病的症候又是那末相像，而沒有規定，所以光把臨床上的症候作爲診斷的目標，是不可能的，一定要檢查糞便。明白地說，我們在糞便裏面找到了某一種腸寄生卵，或者某一種腸寄生蟲，或者某一種腸寄生蟲的片節，才能够診斷是某一種腸寄生蟲病。　　關於糞便的檢查，非常複雜，不是屬於今开所講的範圍內，這兒用不到寫</p>
<p>腸寄生蟲的病治療，或者光是吃些藥，不用住醫院，像薑蟲病；或者必須吃藥和灌腸並用，像蟯蟲病；或者非住院不易治療，像十二指腸病。總之這些都是醫師的責任，病有不要聽從醫師的指導就得了，毋用多寫。　　腸寄生蟲病的預防，必須國家和人民共同努力，才有辦法，因此衛生行政不發逹的中國，有許多是辦不到的，與其希望太髙，而不能實現，不如脚踏實地的幹，所以這兒所寫的，不過是幾種人都能够做得到的簡易預防法。　　在講到腸寄生蟲病預防法以前，必須先說腸寄生的傳染路徑。路徑明白了，預防當然容易着手。譬如捉强盜一定先得打聽强盜的容貌，强盜的巢穴；不然像瘋子似的滿街亂跑亂找，那裏會捉得到强盜呢？那末不明瞭腸寄生蟲的傳染路徑，怎麽能够着生預防呢？（未完）</p>
<h3>聽汪院長演詞後的感想</h3>
<p>— 女醫師陳保勤</p>
<p>於第三屆全國醫師代表大會開幕後之第二日，汪院長招待各地代表於鐵部大禮堂，汪院長卽席演說，闡明新舊醫之名義，極爲詳盡，更舉出國人思想上之癥結，句旬中覈，雖然他很客氣底說他是一個醫學的門外漢，但是這種頭腦清晰，能辨明是非的門外漢，却利於門內漢的進展不少。</p>
<p>他的演詞，在各報上早經披露過了，國人讀到這篇文字着實得益不少。它的內容也不用我來重提了，因爲汪院長不是一個醫學家，所以他只能看出國人對於新醫觀念的模糊，却沒有細說糢糊的原因。他說「……我們覺得中國人對於殺人的工具比較進步，判斷得極爲清楚；而對於生人工具的比較進步，却極糢糊，有舉棋不定的趨向。……」以下僅舉了許多事實來證明他的觀察，但如有人問道：「國人對於殺人工具之進步看得那樣清楚，何以獨對於生人工具之進步倒看不出來呢？」這個問題在汪院長或者因爲時間關係，還不能充分的答覆。我們現在就想在這個問題之下，來補充幾句：</p>
<p>中國人對於醫學進步糢糊的原因：第一，還是由於智識幼稚，他們只有直接的觀感，而缺乏學理的推斷，他們只看得出刀槍殺人是要靠近去殺，對方還要照顧殺人者自身，是很危險的，遠不如新式槍砲，可以遙取人命；况且一砲可以殺千百人，更不是笨拙的刀槍弓箭可以比擬。所以中國舊式刀槍弓箭與外國新式飛機槍砲之殺人效力，就是五尺之童，也能判斷清楚，國人的智識，雖然幼稚，難道還有人不知道貓之不能敵虎嗎？</p>
<p>醫學的理論和事實，並非如此簡單，科學醫學只能求人之不枉死，亦不能求人之不死。贅言之，卽新醫亦無長生不老之方，使人人皆得永久生存於世界，故病有不治之病：反之人體有天然之抗力，故亦有不治而愈之病，更有本可</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>自愈之病，因受不良醫藥之摧殘而反成不治者，或有某醫治愈而某醫治壞，或某醫治壞而某醫治愈，或有某醫表面治壞，而實爲該病症應有之趨勢者：例如在傷寒病之初期，亦有某醫表面治愈，而實際未愈者。例如許多病，僅施以對症療法可使熱度之降，疼痛暫止等也。凡此種種複雜之現象，以及治愈治壞之原因，絕非普通人所能了解判斷；所以新醫雖有長足的進展，絕不像武器那樣顯明易見。現在再舉一件事情，就更明白了。我們常聽到一般自號新人物的先生們說：「西醫的外科不錯，你看治瘡傷是多麼快喲！恐怕內科不及中醫吧？」他們也是直接的觀察，只見到新醫外表所看得到的地方，所謂知其然，而不知其所以然罷了。正如鄕村野老，讚美洋人的飛機大砲一般。他們何會知道飛機大砲的眞精神在那裏,來歷在那裏呢？這種科學是無影無形的，可算是眞正的精神文明,絕不是一般頭腦冬烘的國人,所提倡之不長進的復古派精神文明所可比擬。</p>
<p>第二是因爲一部份新醫不能令人信服。我國人不信服新醫固然是因爲民衆的智識幼稚，不辨愚賢，而一部份新醫之不能令人信服，亦爲不可掩飾之事實，現在許多懸壺或在公私立醫院中擔任醫務的醫生，有的是因爲他對於學理和技能，不會受過嚴格的訓練，每遇一病之來輒不知如何診斷，所用之藥自無效騐之可言。有的是因爲月薪有定，認爲病人之多寡，　醫治之成績，均與自身之利益名譽無關，其對病人每不加詳細之診察，遂敷衍了事，以免病者糾纏而應接之不暇。其尤甚者，則爲妄自尊大如遼東豕，非其同儔，誰足與之談，病人之貧困者，不値彼之一顧，故病人往往主訴未完，而藥方已寫就，如此草率從事，焉得使人信仰。好事者遂時相責難，前數日報端有謂：「以中國首屈一指的大醫院，而竟對病人如是疎忽」云云，就是此輩所引起了。更有一般不學無術之徒，假冒醫師名義，打針下藥，欺騙金錢，遺害於人，尤非淺鮮。然而這都是人的問題，而不是學術的問題，若政府决心整頓，也何嘗不可用重典來取締呢？最近更得一有趣之新聞。某機關擬設立鄕村診病所數處，爲節省經費計，不願另聘醫生。卽將各郷村小學教員略加訓練。以兼醫師之職。這未免把小學教員看成萬能。同時把醫學看得太簡單容易了。如是做法，中國醫藥術生前途眞不堪設想，而中國人對於新醫的不認識，這也是一個明證。</p>
<p>第三，是因爲舊醫的反宣傳，新醫在中國雖在萌芽而許多了解科學眞諦的智識分子，已不肯將其寶貴之生命付托於不可理喻的中醫，因而引起一種職業問題之反宣傳，竟有幾位巨公大人，不察是非，不明眞諦，起而附和，狐假虎威，愚者益受其惑。因此玄妙的中國舊醫，仍得猖獗於今日。若說中醫是國粹，不應廢除。那麼，爲什麼棄刀槍弓箭而不用，國人倒並不奔走呼號，痛哭流涕，而說什麽國粹之淪亡呢？至於國藥，本當提取化騐，以期適用於新醫之治療，這種工作，是應用科學才能做呢？還是講求陰陽五行六氣的先生們所能爲的呢？所以提倡中西醫携手，取西醫之長，補中舊不足的人，他根本就不懂得科學。　　我國民衆旣這樣的昏瞶，這樣的麻木，我們自負醫學重任的人，怎忍不盡心竭力，去喚醒他們的迷夢，拯救他們跳出玄學魔鬼的陷坑，脫離死神的羈絆。好在我們努力醫學革命的余雲岫先生，已經把舊醫的根據地推翻了，他的書出版二十年來，沒有人可作旗鼓相當的辨論，國人就應該十会明瞭了。可惜國人是眞性的麻木，完全失去了理智的本能，簡直不可救藥，所以余先生至今嘆惜他的革命尙未成功。　（參閱醫學革命論第二集第五九頁）革命本來不是一件容易的工作，凡是改革都有一種抵抗力，在理論上雖然是把舊的打倒，而在事實上，終難完全改良，况且余先生只有革命的理論，而無革命的工具。就是他的書籍，在普通書坊尙不常見，而他第一集的文字雖不是十分深奥。亦非普通人所能了解。這可以說是缺少宣傳工作，宣傳不到家，革命就不易顺利，難道說中山先生做一部古文式的三民主義，藏在家中，也可以打倒軍阀嗎？說到宣傳方面，我們又不能不歸咎於我國的新聞記者了。從前我國的新聞記者多數是不相信新醫是進步的，所以關於辯駁中醫的文字，往往不肯登載，反而常常刋載許多反宣傳的作品，以投人之所好。因此余先生以一介醫師，又不是黨國要人，人微言輕，雖然他說怎樣有理，很少被人注意。所以在前數年無論他怎樣用力吶喊，除了一部分醫界中人深表同情之外，社會上是很少有人理睬他的。雖然如今幾年，報館也明白些了，社會也注意些了。可是無理的玄學防綫，倒又加深了一道了。由此我常覺得大人先生的一舉一動，總値得一般人的重視與模倣。今後我又希望黨國要人們，常常偷閒發表一兩篇，提倡科學的言論，或文字，說得好與不好都不要緊，一定能够更惹起社會人士的注意，只要有人注意，就有辨法，就可以無形中拯救了每年枉死的冤魂。所以汪院長的演詞，在各報發表之後，眞是授惠中國民族不淺。</p>

<p>久讀陳君肺癆槪論。知君抱舊醫新釋。而舊藥新用之宏願者。至足嘉也。然舊醫而能廢棄五行六氣陰陽生尅玄說。引取證騐事實。趨向科學。確係新舊過渡時期之一好現象。惟談新醫者。貴有數理化科學根底。庶幾引襲文章。得免魯魚亥豕。以見笑大方。若强以不知爲知。而賣弄聰明。輕參已見。不特有鄭聲亂樂之嫌。抑且自損價格。甚無爲也。至舊藥之能否新用。爲吾輩日夜所希冀而不能須臾忘者。第此類工作。宜認明從實騐而證之以科學。庶幾基礎鞏固。不爲微風漾蕩。苟在科學醫說之下。而依然附合以非科學之藥品。令人不能無首尾兩端之感也。不佞二十年來。對於肺勞。略有獵涉。深願以一得之愚。引陳君爲同志。而切之磋之。陳君其許我乎。</p>
<p>按日光之有益人體。並能療病。我國認識甚早。初不待泰西之傳來。如素問四氣調神大論。謂天氣。清凈光明者也。藏德不止。故不下也。又生氣通天論。謂平旦人氣生。日中而陽氣隆。日西而陽氣已虛。氣門乃閉。晋王導傳。謂若太陽下。同萬物蒼生。何由仰照。又張華祖道西征詩。亦有陶以仁化。曜以天光之句。皆認識天日之光。爲吾人賴以化育之源。而痘疹之應用紅光。尤爲我國從來通俗所知之光線療法。惟肺勞之應用日光。不見舊籍經典。其爲近代學術可知。今欲論日光治肺之先。不可不略述日光之分析。與光線功用之本能。顧非曾攻物理學者。不是信也。考日光雖清明朗耀。普照十方。而其實並非白色。乃各色光線混合而然。試以三稜之分光鏡Spestroskop析之。可辨爲紅，橙黄，黄，綠，靑，藍，紫之七色。驟雨將霽。天外現虹。卽水蒸氣折光而映入我眼簾之分光現象也。此吾輩可見之線也。此外尙有人目所不能見之兩線，曰紅外線。與紫外線。合之適成九種光線。雖尙書考靈曜。本有日有九光。光照四極句。語同而意實異也。凡光線。因屈折率大小。與光波之長短。而不同。故九種光線中。屈折大而光波短者。爲紫外紫，藍靑綫各綫。乃細菌及化學綫。屈折小而光波長者。爲紅外與紅綫。乃溫𤍠綫。惟太陽旣同發各種之綫�</p>
<p>。則吾輩所得之日光。卽有混同作用。而生物界所賴以生活成長者卽此。膚見者流。以爲光天化日之下。普遍無殊也。殊不知日光之源。發自太陽。其通過天空萬里之間。在離地面較遠之同溫層。空氣稀薄。溫度平均。目今尙不知於此大空。有無其他物質。然近據高昇探險家報告。謂地球四周。約離地面五十英里。均爲空氣包圍。而此五十英里厚之空氣。可分爲兩大層。由地面至十一英里之髙空。謂之對流層Tropcsphere。此層在南北兩極。離地面髙度。不過僅逹六英里左右。在對流層內之空氣。因受地面溫度不同之影響。常上下流動。因有風雲雨雪種種氣象之變化。若離地面愈遠。則空氣愈冷。對流之能力愈减。乃風雲雨雪霧等之種種變象亦漸稀。若髙過十一英里。則空氣稀冷。殆不流動。故謂之同溫層Strotosphere。在同溫層中透過之日光。有無與發光體所發之光變異現尙缺乏實騐報告。而對流層中之空氣。旣有寒溫。卽有濃薄。且加以地面較近層內。常雜以生物與非生物所發之物理及化學物質的變化。非常複雜。因此透過是層。而得射到地面之日光。其中所含光綫。不能一致。是不僅有量之多少相差。其一部或竟完全消失。而以紅外紫外兩綫。影響尤甚。據德國E.Daunmeyer　u.A.Puttenaner兩氏之實騐報告。謂柏林及漢堡Berlinu.Heuburg等都市地方。每年僅在五月至八月之間。日光中之紫外綫。可逹地面。此外則爲紫外光之黑暗時期。由是。益知對流層內透過之日光。不特髙下之間。顯有區别。卽同一地面所射到之處。因有種種複雜關係。而亦時有變異者也。</p>
<h3>中藥西用　（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>▲（十九）龍膽Gentiana</p>
<p>（本原）</p>
<p>本品爲龍膽科（Gentianaceae)植物龍膽草（Gentiana　Scabra　Bunge)之乾燥根狀莖及根。其原植物係野生之宿根草。莖直立。葉�</p>
<p>似竹葉。對生而無葉柄。十月間。於莖之頂部及上部葉腋。開藍靑色合瓣花三五朶。畫展而夜合。</p>
<p>（性狀）本品之根狀莖。長逹一dm.。直徑約五mm.。現暗灰棕色。有不�</p>
<p>規則之環紋。上端有莖痕或莖之殘基。下面及側面。則生多數之根。其長約爲二dm.直徑約三mm.。現淡棕黄色。有縱皺紋。質軟靭。但乾燥時。則易於折斷。有特殊之臭氣。味極苦。</p>
<p>（成分）　本品之有苦味。係因含有結晶性苦味配糖體龍膽苦味素(Gentiopiprin　Br6H2oO9)也。含存於新鮮之根中。乾燥者。則因酵素之作用。分解過半。其結晶與稀酸類共𤍠之。亦分解爲無苦味之�</p>
<p>Gentiogenin及葡萄糖。其他尙含有百分之四gentianose三糖體。</p>
<p>（試騐）　本品之粉末，有用黄土及愈凔木末以冲假者。除用顯微鏡檢查外。尙可定量其灰分。倘有百分之六以上殘留物者。卽爲混有不潔之根及僞造物也。</p>
<p>（效用）　本品爲苦味健胃藥。常與他藥伍用。劑量一次爲Ｏ，五至二gm。</p>
<p>（附錄舊說）　大苦大寒。沉陰下行。益肝膽而而潟火。兼入膀胱腎經。除下焦之濕氣。與防已同功。　　（附注）　近來常有認龍膽根與健替娜根爲一物者。其實龍膽根是Gentiana　Scabra　Bunge之根。健替娜根是採集Gentiana　luter　L,Gentiana　pannonica　Scop,Gentiana　purpurea　I.及Gentiana　punctata　I.等諸植物之根及根莖而成者。其功效雖同。皀龍膽可以代替健替娜，而植物實異。今中華藥典中龍膽之英拉丁名。竟採一Gentiana字。不知與英美藥典之健替娜Gentiana有異否。應有說明及改正之必要。</p>

<h3>「天道」</h3>
<p>— 張恢</p>
<p>若干年來統治着中國的倫理，全部出自儒書。佛敎的思想走極端，非「中庸」之道，故佛子雖在這世間生活，服從一切國王王子大臣，然他們却從人業中離開，占住了山川風物極優美底地方，算是逍遙「世外」。道士們比較妥恊，原來的哲理要據幷不分明。黄老的哲學雖髙深，然非道士們所奉的宗敎。越流越低下，弄到後來假借些燒丹煉汞的把戲，出沒於公卿間。這幾派的倫理將人民的腦筋圍的水洩不能通。布着地網天羅，但凡有一種稍奇異底稍特出底思想產生，便給它們完全呑滅下去。像一個蜘蛛呑滅一隻晴蜓或蠅子。</p>
<p>然而無論出世入世，生活二安抛不開，旣有生活，必有鬥爭；旣有鬥爭，必終之以殺戮。所以許多出世之道，其實也正是入世之門宣傳「福音」者，一方面固然是救人，但大半是要救自已。</p>
<p>於是將一切理想的纸冠毁掉，露出生命原始底眞形。這時三敎以至五敎乃眞同源，來了一個攏統底調和｜｜曰「天道」。　　「天道」統治着中國社會，已五千年。它無所不包，無所不貫。孔夫子知而不　　說，聰明人做而不言。蕩蕩平平是「天道」，殺人如草不聞聲也是「天道」。做官的是行「天道」，爲盜的也是「替天行道」。讀水滸裏的梁山泊諸公的行爲，看他們一個個輪起板斧或長槍，殺的落花流水，未始不以爲痛快，因爲覺得他們是在殺人麽？以爲他們是「替天行道」呢！</p>
<p>便是一切罪惡的藉口，野蠻的解釋。天道有分於陰陽，幷無分於善惡。對於渠們善惡都是好的，正如有夜裏也要有白天，這正是陰陽之分。而天又是什魔呢？那妙處是「天何言哉？」恰恰是｜｜渠渠們自已。</p>
<p>翻開歷史一看，這麽一套把戲，要了五千年。人命草木似的滋生，也草木似的奄滅。文明華胃如果不將這野蠻的「天道」推翻，重新建立起新的「世道」來，則滅亡的日子也不遠哩！</p>
<h3>進了天國</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>大槪由於衣服太髒了一點的原故吧，在禮拜堂前拉客去聽聖經的男女，就並不拖我，但我却偏要進去，雍容不迫地走了進去。然而，我不是要去接受福音的，也不是要去叨求恩惠的，只想在溫暖的屋宇下面，倚着有背靠的長椅，安安靜靜地打坐一會罷了。因爲好幾夜的街頭露宿，已經使我感到微微病了。那時是在遠離故鄕的昆明地方，正當着秋風白露來臨的晚上。</p>
<p>有誰曾在夜深凄凉的街頭，徬徨無依的時候，突然能在燈光燦然，𤍠氣溫暾�</p>
<p>的屋子裏，坐過的麽？要他才能領略我那時的快樂了。當我把身子捱在一個老人的旁邊之後，便覺得人是在雲裏霧裏的，如同進了天國一樣，又好像敵視我的世界，也忽然與我變好起來了。</p>
<p>「…上帝對待一切人都是平等的…」</p>
<p>三十多歲的一個牧師站在講臺上大聲地說着，似乎這話還很慰貼人的心窩，但我却無意細聽下去，只把頭掉來掉去，好奇地四處望望。在不遠的旁邊，倚着壁，立着一個職員模樣的靑年，睜着冷冷靜靜的眼睛，嚴厲地射着我。我明白，這是監視我的，防範我的。大約因爲我的衣衫，我的頭髮，我的面容，都在說明着我來這兒是另有所圖的吧。我不管他的，只是規規矩矩地坐着，裝成彷彿眞在聽着那樣誠心的樣子。</p>
<p>男的下了講臺，另換上一個女的，聲音和姿態，立刻使大家動容起來，雖然說的話語，播的福音，還是仍舊一樣的。我偷看監視我的那位，目光也漸漸掉了方向，射到女宣敎師那兒去了。那女的的確說得很動人，講到上帝憐憫窮人的時候，就把她那兩條細眉豎成八字那樣的形式，手撫在豐滿的胸口上面，發出同情的微喟的聲音。使人彷佛覺得倘如世間眞有這麽一位女上帝，那末，人們大槪會要變得更規矩些聽話些吧。</p>
<p>偶爾可以看見她那水也似的黑眼睛，向我的旁邊很迅速地投以溫柔的一瞥便看得這個職員模樣的靑年簡直獃住了�</p>
<p>，湧在嘴角邊上的唾沫，也將圓圓的露珠那樣的形式，拉長了，牽絲往下滴了。如果基督突然瞧着有這麽一位信徒是如此誠心誠意地在聽取他遺留下的福音，那一定是很喜歡的哪。另一個職員模樣的靑年過來了，用手肘碰碰他，又把嘴巴尖着向我這邊遞了一下，意思當然是呌他注意監視的責任的，同時又譏諷地發着低微的笑聲。他馬上臉紅筋漲的，窘迫着了。而我也在不知不覺地想笑起來。他立刻把發怒的眼光，凝在我的臉上，隨卽走到我的面前，用低沉的聲音說：</p>
<p>「请你出去！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」</p>
<p>我冷冷地反問。</p>
<p>「爲什麽？……你得出去就是了。」</p>
<p>他簡直氣得週身發颤起來，話聲雖是�</p>
<p>仍舊低小，但却像從牙齒裏磨出來的一樣。聽着那女的吐着清朗的媚人的聲音，又說到窮人苦人最受上帝愛憐那一句的時候，我便被人推出門外，走到秋風掃着的街頭去了。</p>
<h3>誰是「海派」？</h3>
<p>— 靑農</p>
<p>舊戲有「京派」與「海派」之别，談舊戲的人，老是重「京派」而輕「海派」。沈從文先生在北方發表言論，指斥中國文壇的「海派」，這自然亦是尊重「京派」，輕視「海派」之意。徐懋庸先生提出抗議，以爲倘眞有「京派」與「海派」之别，在特徵上「海派」只有「商業競賣」，而「名士才情」應屬「京派」，說來亦是很有道理。可是，我以爲「海派」確實是有的，且這一羣海派文人因着「商業競賣」的特徵已經是連人格和稿子一起賣了，這不用怪及「京派」作家的輕視。個中人心裏有數，原不必多所嘵舌。倘以爲自己在上海賣文，人家駡秃驢，便以爲自己也是和尙而憤憤然以爭，那是大可以不必的</p>
<p>誰是「海派」？今天讓我來拆穿西洋鏡：</p>
<p>偸了成名作家的作品冒名發表的人，是「海派」。以朋友的優秀作品聲稱借看而冒名發表以成名的人，是「海派」。自己已經成名而以未成名作家的作品用自己的「招牌」發表以騙錢的人，是「海派」。翻譯外國雜誌的文章以及整本作品不注明是譯作而發表的人，是「海派」。以廉價收買翻譯作品而用自已的「招牌」以求名利雙收的人，是「海派」。……</p>
<p>這一羣「海派」文人，有老有少，「始作俑者」固然可恥，「尤而效之」者實亦作俑」固然可恥，「尢而效之」者實亦可羞。事實昭彰，無可諱言，在上海的非「海派」文人應該自己起來澄清，不必麻煩「京派」文人勞師遠征。</p>
<h3>如此廣州</h3>
<p>— 味荔</p>
<p>××：</p>
<p>朋友，你沒有到過廣州，也許和幾個月以前的我一樣，以爲廣州市是我國南方一個最新式的都市罷？</p>
<p>我們所謂新式，你說是不是，不僅指物質的建設，同時包括「文化」而言。不錯，珠江岸上連排的嗎頭，新築的柏油馬路，矗立雲霄的洋房，規模宏大的百貨店，火車，汽車……這確是我理想中的廣州市。但是，在「文化」方面，我感到無限的失望。在未來之前，我想廣州風氣一定比內地開通得多，因爲這裏與外國人通商最早，並且又是國民革命的策源地。可是到這裏一看，完全不是那麽一回事。</p>
<p>不說别的，單論敎育程度，廣州市恐怕比「北方」差好幾年。這是許多廣東朋友告訴我的，照我個人的經騐，他們講的並不是客氣話。的確，這裏的髙中畢業生至多抵得上南京上海北平等處髙中一年级學生；甚至有許多大學生程度還不及外地髙中一年级學生呢！雖則國立中山大學，現在正步其他國立大學的「後塵」，天天催敎育部匯錢來完成新校舍，然而離所謂「西南最髙學府」實在還遠得很呢。　　至於廣州人的日常生活離我所想像的更遠了。「吃在廣州」，所以茶樓酒館滿街皆是。不但有錢的主顧們時常到這些地方來走走，就是拉洋車的每天車拉完之後也總來喝幾碗茶。其次是賭博的普遍。隨便你搬到那條街去住，你總聽到隔壁义麻雀的聲音，有些人日夜坐在賭桌上過生活。賣「發財票」的小店街上觸目皆是；頭彩多少萬元的大字條在你面前招幌着。廣州市近來總算有點進步，街上不大看見「搖攤」這許多玩意兒，如果你跨過海珠橋到河南去看看，那是另一個世界！再其次談到鴉片。鴉片是公開的秘密，每條小巷裏面總有幾家「髙等戒烟室」，聽說在河南這呌做「談話處。」</p>
<p>最使我失望的就是廣州人的迷信。因爲迷信，所以無論碰到什麽事情，他們都喜歡放鞭炮。初一十五祭神放炮；人家娶媳婦放炮；歡迎香港來的步行隊沿途放鞭炮；發財票中彩錢莊門口放鞭炮。我們大學在行開學禮那天，政府要人訓話完畢之後，大家都到操塲裏拍照，學校門口放鞭炮助與！</p>
<p>但是，還有許多更奇怪的事情。下面這段新聞，如果我寫出來，你看了一定不會相信，所以我把牠從報纸上完全剪下來，這樣你也許不會說我造謠罷。</p>
<p>「自日前本市惠福路，和陞齋纸店與對門惠和粥店，各塑獅鷹姜太公等物，互相鬥法一事發生後，嗣經該叚公安分局制止飭令兩造拆去，事始寢息。不謂無獨有偶，近日於最繁盛之長堤中，又發現此種鬥法式之舉動，可謂後先輝映。事緣長堤海珠路新塡地未列門牌之某藻肆落成後，卽行繪製猛虎三隻，懸於騎樓邊以爲號召，猝然看去，果像斑爛之白額虎活現於上。對門五十四號爲廣同發辦館，睹狀大爲不滿，以白虎當頭煞氣，非同小可，各店伴亦惴惴不安，店東乃購一玄壇像供奉店中，意謂玄壇可以伏虎，當能擋煞。詎近數日某藥肆又多增白虎數隻於其上，更用電燈鑲於虎目，以助聲威，入夜以後，目光炯炯，益露兇惡。廣同發以其有意惡作劇，遂急卽定造文餘長之大横額招牌，中繪一巨大玄壇之像，竪眉怒目，一手執戟，一手伏虎，勢亦猙獰。雙方�</p>
<p>大鬥法寶。而海珠路口怡香茶居老板，以連日生意冷淡，亦歸咎對門猛虎作崇，急延某堪與師察看，又謂白虎當頭，將有不利，乃敎以擋煞之法，着怡香老板訂製鋅鐵李逵兩個，分站於二樓之招牌鍘，咋已製成，該像燕額虎鬚，神勇無匹，四目上均嵌以電燈，手持雙板斧，向對門之虎，大有厮殺之勢，因以水滸傳之李逵有殺虎之勇，故以之制虎，由是與廣同發之玄壇成爲牴角之勢。」</p>
<p>朋友，這齣白虎玄壇李逵三鬥法的趣劇，居然在廣州市最𤍠閙的長堤扮演，�</p>
<p>這是你猜得到的嗎？幸而你沒有來廣州，不然你也同我一樣感到失望的悲哀了。</p>
<h3>日出之前　（一）</h3>
<p>— 髙植</p>
<p>王花村一帶連報曉的雞也被人吃掉了，在靜寂中，黑夜顯得更豐長。</p>
<p>秦大娘睜着眼醒在床上，等候天亮，她不能估計這時該是「鷄呌二遍」還是「鷄呌三遍」，却幻覺地彷彿聽到鷄呌，覺得大槪已經交過丑了。屋裏是漆黑的，屋上有微微的風聲，還聽到有甚麼人在田野裏遠遠地哭着，她又不禁心酸起來，想起前一些時餓病而死的小兒子來福，眼水冰凉的又從顴顋邊流到枕上去了。她不忍再聽那遠處的哭聲。她懊惱地盤算了一夜，總也想不出辦法留下她的女兒連弟。連弟正睡在她的旁邊，正打着鼾。她再聽隣房的三嬸媽也正酣睡着，一點兒動靜都沒有。她捨不得女兒走，但女兒留在家裏要挨餓，說不定也會像她的小兒子一樣成病死掉，倒不如狠心一點，在無可奈何中，求得母女們苟延殘喘。她於是决心讓女兒離開玉花村了。玉花村的人口日漸減少，流亡的流亡，死的死，留着的便都想去逃荒。玉花村一帶數十里的地方，看不見一朵朶花，樹芽和野菜也全被人吃光了。池塘裏的魚都捉完了，涸塘泥淖裏的泥鰍捉完了，有人因爲捉魚而淹死在水裏，每個池塘裏却還成天有人在搜尋，水裏的浮萍也被人撈起來作了食品。屋脊上的麻雀窩也都搜索過，高樹上的鳥巢也都有探過，在黃昏的時候，歸巢老鴉的聒噪聲是聽不到的了。</p>
<p>除了僅餘的皮包骨的耕牛外，推磨的驢和守夜的狗都被吃掉了。村前一年不曾晒穀的土坪上不再看見一頭肥猪或者一隻鵝或鴨。所有的女婴被淹死在水裏，男孩子到喂也不濟事時，做你母的只好流着眼涙把他埋掉，傷心地低語着：</p>
<p>「早一點去投胎到有錢的人家去吧！」</p>
<p>從遠處村鎭裏偷一頭小猪或小羊，因而打成人命的事也是常有的。在野外成天有許多男女剷菜，無論是田塍邊，還是溝壑旁，只剩下一片荒瘠的黄土，看不見一點靑色。有的人剷着剷着就沒有力氣，軟倒下來，在地上躺過兩天，日晒夜露，便連呻吟也無力發出，聽到的人都恐怖地，憐莫能助地故意避開，於是先還可以掙抓土的人後來是動也不能動，意識漸漸模糊，直到最後從口裏淌出黄水，黄水在土裏乾掉，人就餓死了。無人過問的死屍便成�</p>
<p>了野獸野鳥的實貴食品。若有人能够花一天的功夫把肚子用野菜塡一頓，便要快樂得發狂的。</p>
<p>在這種情况下，秦大娘聽到城裏有人願把她的女兒連弟領去，自然是無法再留她了。城裏的三嬸媽是中間人，她昨天進過城，跟三嬸媽一同到公館裏去見過老爺，那老爺因爲自己年紀已經四十開外，姨太太又不能生餋，聽說連弟年輕貌美，願意接過去。秦大娘在公館裏吃了一頓自己家裏的年飯也比不上的午餐。那公館裏的氣派使她有點暗自愛慕。</p>
<p>她在城隍廟裏求過籤，道士解釋過，說籤好，她便陪着三嬸媽一同出城了。</p>
<p>她心裏雖不很願意，同時又無可奈何，不自主地說道：</p>
<p>「三嬸媽，我看年紀太不合了。」</p>
<p>「秦大娘，你說到那裏去了，老爺是好心腸兒，待人厚道。你不要三心二意。籤上不是說好嗎？」</p>

<h3>美國證券投資制度之新轉變</h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>（一）導言</p>
<p>美羅斯福總統執政以來，卽致力於產業，</p>
<p>金融及諸般復與救濟計劃；中外學者對之雖有見仁見智之别，然其重視之則一也。夫美國之經濟恐慌，金融恐慌爲之厲階。夷考金融恐慌之構成，又槪因银行制度不良有以致之。故研究其銀行制度之臧否，或亦卽探討其金融恐慌以至經濟恐慌癥结所在之唯一方法。職是之故，美國藍鷹運動中，亦有統制銀行業之政策焉。今夫銀行之業務，其重要者爲受人信用與授人信用；受人信用以存欵爲主，授人信用以放欵投資爲主。故羅斯福之整理美國銀行業，卽從兩方面着手，一以處理存欵，一以處理放欵投資。所以然者，雙管齊下，始克收完成之功也。關於前一項，如所謂銀行法者（Glass-Steagall　Bank)|吾友徐君毓枬已有專文論述，請參閱本刋第五十七期，後者則有證券法(billSecurilies　Act)之制定。茲请槪术美國證券投資制度之沿革，與證券法之內容若次。</p>
<p>（二）證券投資制度之隆盛與衰微</p>
<p>美國證券投資制度之發逹，較遲於歐陸各大國（英·德·法）者約半世紀。泊乎十九世紀中葉，證券之投資额，爲數尙尠。據美國財政部年報所發表之數字，一八五零年時，表現爲有價證券之資產，僅估美國財富總額百分之十六。南北戰爭後，有價證券卽作急速增加。一八六五年至一九三二年間，紐約股票交易所所登錄之股票發行種類，從一三六增至一二七八，債券發行額，於同期間亦從一七四增至一六0一0一九零八年以證券之形態而表現之財富，約佔美國總財富百分之二十三，迨一九三二年已增至百分之七十五。其突飛猛進，實足驚人。推原其故，實基因於南北戰爭時，聯邦政府發行之公債，漸普遍於個人的投資者間之故。世界大戰中，因有所謂「自由公債」（LibcrtyBond)之募集，更使證券之購買有普及與能通俗化之趨向。在此種情形下，美國證券投資者數目之激增，實非偶然。據穏健之推測，西美戰爭（Spanish-Ameridan　War)時，美國政府募集公債，應募者約三十二萬人，到大戰時則負擔公債者，竟逹數百萬人之譜。（註一）</p>
<p>上文係僅從其量的方面觀察，若更就其質的方面觀察，則進展頗異其途徑。如他國證券投資市塲然，美國證券市塲有一般的價値暴落之趨勢。據Moodys　Investors'Service所作成之債券價格指數觀之，一八六零年爲六六·三０。至一九零二年增到九九·五三，其後漸次低落，至一九三二年六月竟低至五三·九０。卽十九世紀末葉，債券價格大有騰貴，至二十世紀則一瀉千丈，不可收拾矣。至最近金融恐慌所給予證券投資市塲之惡影響，更可於下列數字窺見一斑。紐約股票交易所之債券交易總額，一九三一年一月爲四七、三八四、八０五、八九九元，至一九三三年四月則减至三０、五五四、四三一、０九九元。股票總额亦大有减低：一九二九年九月爲八九、六六八、二七六、八五四元，一九三二年七月則减至一五、六三三、四七九、五七七元。（註二）</p>
<p>（三）證券投資衰退之原因</p>
<p>美國證券投資事業之衰退，其帮蓋有多端：如國內連續發生種種不良之政治的及經濟的事件均是。歐洲投資制度之式微，影響所及，亦匪鮮尠。又如移民之禁止，人口增加率之减少，關稅法規之頒布，以及一般物價平凖之暴落，其直接影響於股票利息及債券償還，從而間接足以影響有價證券價格也。然上术諸因，究爲間接的，而直接决定此證券投資制度之衰�</p>
<p>敗者，厥爲投資制度自身之二大缺陷。此二缺陷卽：運用者（證券之賣主，買主及證券業者）之不善與乎證券生產之過剩是也。</p>
<p>茲先就第一項言之。夫證劵之賣主，通常爲各種公司，地方自治團體及政府，蓋此等團體，在法律上有發行有價證劵之權利也。美國各大公司之發行證券，其常有以過重評價之資產爲基礎，固世人所盡知，帮其貽害殊大。且此等機關，又常與資力薄弱或目的不健全之企業締結密切關係，是以其根基易於動搖。至於美國之州政府及地方自治團體，亦有濫用欵項之弊，不識撙節經費何物。其借欵額年增無已：一九一四年爲四十九億二千六百萬元，一九三二年乃增至一百九十二億八千五百萬元。其中到期不克償還者，一九一四年僅五億二百萬元，一九三二年增至十四億九千四百萬元。總之，有價、證券之賣主，不論其爲私家的或公家的團體，其屬於不健全者，頗不乏例。</p>
<p>次就證券買主研究之。美國直接證券投資�</p>
<p>者數目之激增，上已言之，結果自二十世紀以來，證券投資市塲之情勢與前逈異：昔爲少數富裕階级擁有多額之證券，今則爲一般的多數的民衆，各保有少額之證券矣。民衆所購買之證券，數額旣少，其不𤍠心於調查，而對證券�</p>
<p>作不批評的購入，實屬理所當然。然在他方面，則證券市塲之客觀情勢反日有複雜化之傾向。證券數量之日增也，種類之日繁也，各種以高利引誘民衆購買證券方法之層出不窮也，以及證券轉移之頻繁也。凡此種種，俱非一般小額之直接投資者所能了解與確斷。證券恐慌之危機以潛伏於是矣。誠然,所可歸咎者,當非全爲此一般民衆，卽經濟學者，銀行家，政府官吏及其他專門家，亦不能辭其咎焉。　直接投資者旣有如此之危險，間接投資者又何獨不然？此間接投資者，卽指一般的商業銀行，儲蓄銀行及保險公司之存戶保戶而言，此等金融機關，曩昔頗以健穩見稱,至一九二零年恐慌者大受損害,隨後卽大失其投資政策之穩健性。此等組織,因爲支付高利之定期存欵之故，迫得挺而走險，購入危險性極大之債券，以冀獲得較高之利息。故若是而客戶乃亦於不知不覺中成爲證券市塲之間接投資者矣。投資者雖有直接與間接之別，然其幸福之寄託於證券市塲之上則一也。</p>
<p>與證券投資制度有密切關係之第三者，爲證券業者或投資銀行家(ＩｎｖｅｓｔｍｅｎｔＢａｎｋｅｒ)。蓋投資銀行家，出賣不良證券，或亦爲證券價格低落之一要因。然揆諸實際，則此種行爲，爲數殊不多覯。如美國證券發行者之代表之紐約股票交易所，除了克魯卡（Ｋｒｅｕｇｅｒ　ａｎｄ　Ｔｏｌｌ）事件外，其上塲之證券，絕對爲不良者，幾無之。</p>
<p>雖然，投資銀行家，對近年證券投資制度之崩潰，亦不能不責其大部份責任也。何則？蓋投資銀行家，對於投資制度之經濟的結構遂行未見得賞有以致之也。一般言之，投資银行家，本質上卽爲發行，買賣，掌握證券業者，其證券購入機能，尤大有社會的意義。換言之，投資銀行家，有生死予奪之欍，對某種證券購入，則該種證券得普遍流通，對他種證券拒絕，則該種證券將絕跡市塲。若此等銀行家能以宏濟社會爲已任，而選擇品質目的良純之證券，則金融界自得穏定。反之，若其利令智昏，販賣不良證券，以冀獲得髙利，則其昭害豈淺鮮哉！</p>
<p>如是，證券投資市塲之一般公衆，旣不熟諳其投資對象，復眩惑於目前之厚利，勢必物色購買彼等以爲有利之證券。在他方面，投資銀行家亦因與其他同業者競爭以吸收資金，結果亦勢不得不提供利率髙而危險亦髙之證券於市塲。在此種混亂狀態下，證券恐慌之釀成，自是意中事。一九三一年十二月終Finch　Bondrecord中有關於當時四千三百九十八種債券之調查，並製出其不履行率。觀諸左表，卽可瞭然矣。</p>
<p>發行年次　　　　　　發行債券數　不履行率％</p>
<p>一九００年以前　　　七０　　　　一四·八</p>
<p>一九００－一九一三　四一九　　　一四·五</p>
<p>一九一四—一九一九　二０六　　　一０·一</p>
<p>一九二０—一九二二　二六三　　　一八·六</p>
<p>一九二三—一九二四　六三一　　　一八·四</p>
<p>一九二五—一九二六　三七一　　　二一·六</p>
<p>一九二七—一九二八　二二八　　　三一·一</p>
<p>一九二九　　　　　　二六七　　　三一·一</p>
<p>一九三０－一九三一　四九六　　　一一·九</p>
<p>未詳　　　　　　　　五五一　　　二二·０</p>
<p>合計　　　　　　　　四三九八　　二０·二</p>
<p>由上表觀之，則經濟恐慌之深刻程度，直可於債券不履行率覘之。一九二零年時恐慌之際，不履行率突昇至一八·六。又如一九二九年大恐慌襲來時，不履行率之增加，尤爲前此所罕見。凡此種種，俱足證明證券不履行率實價經濟恐慌之指標也。</p>
<p>茲再就證券投資制度自身之第二缺陷－有價證券之生產過剩｜之事實研究之。雄辯莫如事實，觀乎左表則可知金融恐慌前新規發行證券額之激增。（註）（單位百萬美元）</p>
<p>一九二二年四、三０四　一九二六年六、二四三</p>
<p>一九二三年四、二九三　一九二七年七、五二０</p>
<p>一九二四年五、五三四　一九二八年七、０八一</p>
<p>一九二五年六、一七四　一九二九年七、０五二</p>
<p>夫一物之價格，其所以得比較的安定之故，蓋由於供需之平衡。金融市塲中又何獨不然？苟其所供給者超於需要，則其價格之慘落，亦經濟學中必然法則下之現象耳。</p>
<p>（四）證券法內容槪述</p>
<p>證券投資制度之矛盾旣如上述，苟不設法補救，則藍膺運動之失敗實可預言。蓋金融爲百業之中心，運用得宜則可創造景氣，如運用不善，則不景氣立致矣。一九三三年之證券法與銀行法，卽以改善證券投資制度爲目的之法規也。请述其內容之梗槪若次。</p>
<p>證券市塲混亂之原因，旣爲證券買主之不愼，故證券法之主要任務，卽規定各證券業行家須將其經營之證券發行之一切情况，彙爲報告，以待證券委員會之參考研究，並以資爲買主判定各該證券之基凖。對於目的不穏健，信用不充足之證券，俱予取締。蓋若是則不正證券將絕跡市塲，而買主無從購買，因是而證券制度之危機，得消滅於無形矣。</p>
<p>證券法之第二目的，在限制證券之「生產」。蓋證券之生產過剩，旣如上述，不得不有此舉也。夫證券之發生，係因市場上需要有以致之。溯自聯邦凖備條例通過後，美國事業界之組織卽有顯著之變化。卽弱小的個人的單位，一旦而代以大公司之組織，大公司間，更有形成一托辣斯系統之趨勢。結果美國事業界之金融政策，卽從商業信用而趨向於投資信用。換言之，大公司企業，俱在資本市塲中將自已之股票及社債抛出，以募集資金，至小企業亦藉此新金融政策，减輕彼等向銀行之借欵額。此等組織之債務，乃從短期的轉換爲長期的。其表現於金融市塲上者，卽爲支票，匯票以及他種票據額之减少。而他方則爲股票與債券額之增加。其結果，皀爲各產業之長期借欵（FundedDebt)之增，與乎短期借欵（Ｆｕｎｂｅｄ　Ｄｅｂｔ）之减。</p>
<p>年次　　　短期　　　　　長期　　　　　總負　　　　　短債　　　　長債　　　　　負欵　　　　　負債　　　　　債　　　　　　率　　　　　率</p>
<p>一九二０　一六、七五０　四、八二０　　一二·五七０　七七·七％　二二·三％</p>
<p>一九三０　一三、三００　一０、六五八　二三·九五八　一一·一％　四四·一％</p>
<p>（右表單位百萬元美金）</p>
<p>各種票據（狹義的）卽爲短債之具體表現，證券則爲長債之表現。長債之增，十年中竟增至一倍，於此，吾人雖無統計數字證明各企業之濫用長債，然在理論上其爲證券生產過剩可甚爲可能也。</p>
<p>證券法之第三目的，卽在乎組織證券投資托辣斯(Investment　Trust)。此項組織，本非新颖之物，一九二０年恐慌後卽曾一度有此種組織出現，後以辦理不善遂告失敗焉。（註四）雖然，羅斯福之再度組織證券投資托辣斯，固有其理在也。蓋嚋昔之失敗，係因各州缺乏恊調之故，如波斯頓，芝加哥各地猶持異議。今舉國上下，一致努力於藍應運動，而全金融業，又置於一統一的制度下，其不致覆前轍也明矣。</p>
<p>證券法之內容，當非如是單純，上所枚述者，僅其犖犖大焉者耳。茲以囿於篇幅故，其叙述暫盡於此。（註五）</p>
<p>（五）結後</p>
<p>關於美國證券投資制度之鼎盛衰微，及其原因，以至於羅斯福政府之對策，吾人已作簡括之敘述。由是吾人知證券市塲於國民經濟中所佔之重要地位：各產業之興盛也，其先必有證券業之發展，各產業之崩潰也，證券業亦足以爲最良好指標。今夫美政府旣亦致力於謀證券業之改善，以爲產業復興之前提。現欲對其計畫加以批評雖嫌絕早，然彼旣爲此「求本」之法，則成就之可能性當不至希微也矣。</p>

<h3>湖北捐稅實錄</h3>
<p>— 薛武英</p>
<p>年來救濟農村的呼聲，髙唱入雲，行政院汪先生又提出救農必須廢除苛捐雜稅的口號。這的確是一種極重要的工作。目下政府當局的行政。不免犯了一種矛盾的現象，一方面重徴捐稅，一方面又積極設法救濟。其實，與其花了一筆錢來辦救濟，倒不如减政裁官廢捐之爲得當。現在中央已有此意，先從調查入手，的確是一個很好的消息。本文便是想提出一點從湖北實際調查得來的材料，藉供參考。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>一二八二週祭</h3>
<p>— 雯</p>
<p>在黑漆一團的政治雾圍和懵懂渾噩的从衆生活之中，我們在日歷上又撕到了觸目驚心，創痕尙新之「一二八」的一真！時間是去也怱怱，上海無數市民之飽受荼毒和二十萬萬財富之化爲刦灰的慘痛紀念，到今天恰是整整的兩週年了！　　上海抗日軍民的生命血肉所爭得的果實，就是提倡國貨或「國貨救國」。於是兩年以來，在上海我們看過了「國貨宣傳週」，「國貨展覧會」，「國貨年」，「婦女國貨年」種種猗歟盛哉的花樣。到了今年「一二八」二週年，那法定的紀念方式又是用飛機散發國恥傳單，靜默誌哀，擴大國貨宣傳等。如此朝野一致地提倡國貨，那「國貨救國」的成績就應該斐然可觀，日貨在華的市塲，就應該一落千丈了？</p>
<p>太慘酷的事實，粉碎了這種「國貨救國」的幻想！</p>
<p>據二十六日申時社的消息，去年度日貨在華的輸入額還居二萬元的龐大數字，就上海一埠而論，日貨傾銷的槪况如下：</p>
<p>水泥　去年從上海入口的日產水泥，達五一三，二七五擔。</p>
<p>紙類　去年日本紙類運滬的總額是一‧三五九‧三五三擔，較前年增加三四七‧七九七擔，去年總値一九‧五七三‧九九八金單位，較前年减少六０三·０六二金單位。這種數量與價格的背馳，完全是日貨减價傾銷之故。</p>
<p>毛織木材　去年自滿洲及日本運滬的本材約在一千五百萬擔，價値約一千萬元。去年日貨毛織品的入口，已超英國而居首位。</p>
<p>棉紗布疋　去年在滬所產日紗，約六十萬大包，布八百萬疋。</p>
<p>燃料　去年日煤從上海輸入的，逹三百二十萬噸以上，幾破以前記綠，國產煤則一落千丈。</p>
<p>魚類　去年日本魚輸入上海的數量，爲一二·一五三擔，値二九·七０一·二六三元之鉅。</p>
<p>此外日本在上海小工業的廠家，包含橡皮，機械，化學工業，陶瓷，玻璃，酒釀，製傘，人造絲等生活必需品，其資本總額逹數萬萬之鉅。</p>
<p>從以上各項的數目字中，說明在所謂「國貨年」的民國二十二年，上海的一部分資產階級曾用了至大的努力來帮助「友邦」的對華經濟侵略！鳴乎！哀莫大於心死，恥莫大於辱國，我們在「一二八」二週年的辱國紀念日，竟看到中國資產階級之心死血凉，的成績數字！一切誌哀，下半旗的紀念表示，都不能洗滌若干商人在去年拚命販賣日貨的奇恥大辱，一切國貨年的搖旗吶喊，都敵不過若干奸商夜半開門，暗顯神通的行動！</p>
<p>不能形成社會勢力對奸商作有效的勸告，誰也不配談國貨救國！不能對日貨大量傾銷作有效的抵制，誰也不配表示他對於「一二八」死難軍民的哀悼！</p>
<p>心死是國亡的重要特癥，日貨傾銷的數字說明了中國上層社會之人心已死的眞象。所以，今後救亡雪恥的責任，應該完全落在窮苦同胞身上。</p>
<h3>紀念</h3>
<p>— 祈</p>
<p>歲月如流，轉眼又到了「一二八」的兩週年。回想一年前的松滬被轟炸的慘狀，對於帝國主義的暴日，凡是國民莫不憤恨無已；可是「事過境遷，」今日來作紀念，正合應用這一個祭字。</p>
<p>所謂「祭」者，在日文就是紀念之義，可是咱們現在對於「一二八」能够作什麼紀念呢？你說什麼，都是空話，還是老老實實地定下這麼一個辦法：安排香案，當天祭祀，祈禱着「一二八」不要再來一個吧。這一祭，自也屬於「祈禱和平」的意義。祈禱於天，那是「古已　之於今尤烈」的盛事，咱們卽是理合　　潮流，以拯國難的愛國運動。</p>
<p>然而，有人提議在這「一二八」兩週年的紀念日上，哀痛當時的損失浩大，而來作「國貨運動」以補償於萬一，這辦法也好，只要是實際上有益的事，這也値的努力的工作。咱把貴國對於每一個紀念日，常常只是放了一天假說說空話了事，如果能够在今天這一紀念日不說空話而實際上乾了點有益的工作，不是比較說空話好的多嗎？話又說回來，我恐怕這「國貨運動」在今天又是成一句空話。爲什麼能够預言那是將成了一句空話呢？看看咱們貴國的國貨運動，只是在作了一種道德上的宣傳，而和英美德意等國以至於印度加拿大的辦法不一樣，人家是積極的進行，咱們是消極的喧嚷。提倡國貨運動的最有利的辦法是抵制外貨，道德上的宣傳那是其次，咱們貴國的「開稅壁壘」建築不起，怎麼談得到「挽回權力」呢？</p>
<p>所以，今天紀念「一二八」的兩週年，最好是安排香案，當天紀念，祈禱着「一二八」不要再來一個。如果祈禱於天而不靈，那末，天上的神明都沒有辦法，自然，人也可以有話說了。</p>

<h3>頑固的父母</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一個老友，他是個寒苦的大學生。今年二十歲。他愛上了一個女學生，（現在十八歲）。他倆初擬待她成年後，然後在通知家長的。不料月前，他們事情，被她的姊姊姑母等發覺了。（她自喪母後寄居姊丈家裏。姑母恰巧亦在。）當時她姊姊等說她是敗壞門楣。她姊丈倒是站在中立，兩方不理會，不過說，你們通信，必須經我閱過。因你是居我家裏。（姊丈是中層階級）我的朋友呌她去向她姊姊姑母等懇求，而她却不去，說她們都是封建的舊頭腦，話是白談的我的朋友，本來想索性派人去說親，後因他找不到相當說親之人（必須對方相認識的）中止。現在呢？她的父親，已經從長江輪船回到她的姊姊家裏來，（她父親是在長江輪上當司帳）。我的朋友爲了這事眞是焦慮煩惱極了。她呢？昨天今天連續地電話來，信來，急迫地催促他（我的朋友）火速派人去說親。到了今天，忽地她有寄來一掛號信說：「……呵！這事情，現在業已被姑母等告知父親了，父親便兇狠惱怒地說：我在外而辛苦地賺錢，豈料你在上海放肆得如此，交上男朋友，你眞眞好大膽子，現在話交給你，看你怎樣　　下午我偷聽到父親和姊姊等喃喃商酌，說是將我帶到鄕間去。（在浦東）如果眞的這樣，我們怎麼呢？××喲！我苦死了，現在我約你本月二十七日派人來說親，或是你自己來向父親說話，否則我只有二條路：一，我逃出來同你同居，（我的朋友經濟條件够不上，且又是犯法的行爲。）二，我自己犧牲生命，喲，我是個忠厚的誠摯的人兒，我不負你的…」我的朋友，看後同我磋商辦法。我想除去說親外，也沒有良好的方法。但那裏去找和她父親熟識的適當說親人呢？要他自己去罷，不免太冒昧，爲特冒昧求教先生，萬希代爲勞煩清神一下，早日在報上示一個良善的辦法，至感，至感！專此，卽頌</p>
<p>撰安！　　　　　　　　杜如是上</p>
<p>編者按：關於婚姻問題，本信箱接得來信很多，而且都是些「家庭的障礙」問題。</p>
<p>對於這個問題，我們是不願再說什麼，因爲家庭間的事是不宜「硬」做：我們固然爲了愛情可以而且應當犧牲一切，但是爲了這，而使家庭間永遠不和，破裂了親子間的感情，同樣亦是人生的一個大缺憾。所以，我們以爲解決這種困難，從法律上講，是不生問題，所慮的，就是從家庭方面講，從事實方面講，（如來信所謂「我的朋友的經濟條件是够不上」）都有許多無窮的障礙痛苦和困難。像這封信裏的「他倆」，我們以爲他們在目前的情形下，最好還是由某君很坦白地很誠懇地向某女士的父親求婚，同時更將他個人的家世，素行，她倆的堅決志願，以及他倆的結合是合法的，（卽限據一婚約應由男女當事人自行决定　及男滿十七歲，女滿十五歲卽得訂立婚約等理由）向她父親陳述，我想，這或許是有成功的希望，但萬一不成時，則某君可自行斟酌其環境，而毅然决定</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>其個人應走的途徑，我們是不能代表謀的　　末了，我們還要向有子女的家長們進一言；我們確切知道作父母者之不願子女自由戀愛，爲了子女的前途及幸福實較爲了他們家庭的名譽和門楣爲重他們深恐子女年幼，容易爲一時的情感衝動，致鑄下了畢生的大錯；但是他們因爲太側重了這一方面的原故，竟忽略了如果子女的婚姻不美滿，及其愛情被阻壓，其痛苦較受人欺騙而失足者實相等，且這種痛苦是終身的，其補救辦法更較失足者爲難，因此，我們希望爲家長者，事前對於子女的社交，應加以愼重的考慮和注意，同時隨時以誠摯的忠告訓導子女，而在事後，｜如子女已有了愛人，則父母對於此固仍應加以愼重的注意，和爲他們的前途代謀幸福，但却不能硬逼子女，使他們不能成爲好事；祗要對方（子女的愛人）不是騙子，歹人，那儘管門第，經濟情形，及其爲人不中自己的意，亦應退一步想，讓子女子己决定婚事，這是我們的希望。</p>

<h3>曼麗的自由（九）</h3>
<p>— 曼之</p>
<p>「這證據不充分！」紅鼻子雷先生搖頭說，「到××不是容易的事，何况人傑不是×××。」</p>
<p>「但是，……」小鬍子黄先生談了又停住，他又在半信半疑。　　你們那僕歐進了房間，說，</p>
<p>「黄先生，電話。」</p>
<p>「那裏來的？」</p>
<p>「黄公館。」</p>
<p>小鬍子黄先生下樓接電话去了，我們還在猜這個猜那個，沒有一個定論。「我主張登報找他。」大胖子張先生提議着。</p>
<p>「對。但是不能用眞名，小報一宣傳開去，名譽要緊。」紅鼻子雷先生亦贊成。</p>
<p>「就用他的學名好了，上海的人不曉得。」</p>
<p>「還有，誰登的報呢？」</p>
<p>「用曼麗的名字好了。」</p>
<p>「不行，曼麗不答應可就糟了？」</p>
<p>他們兩人一問一答地正在商量着，小鬍子黄先生鞋聲得得地從樓梯上來，一進門就說：</p>
<p>「有信。人傑給我的信。」</p>
<p>「信在那裏？」</p>
<p>「在我家裏，剛才My　wife打電话說的，就送來。」</p>
<p>「有信，那就明白了！」</p>
<p>第一個髙興的就是那位胖張先生。</p>
<p>「你的公館不是很近嗎，怎麽還不送來？」</p>
<p>才等一分點左右，紅鼻子雷先生就焦迫了。</p>
<p>人傑的信是這樣說的，</p>
<p>「朋友們，别了！一個人在這個時代，無聲無臭地活着，死了，簡就是一匹猪。時代給我們的責任是何等重大，我們至少是應該出了一份力量將歷史的大輪子推動一步。我過去的思想觀是錯誤的，現在醒過來了。我捧着一顆爲人類爲社會奮鬥的心，上征途去了。後世如果有人在記着無名英雄的光榮史，我將要是無名英雄中的一個。」</p>
<p>「别了，朋友們，前途珍重，各自努力！」</p>
<p>這封信雖然是令大胖子張先生他們懹疑着，究竟人傑跑到那裏去了，但人傑不是自殺這事，是安了大家的心。</p>
<p>我回到自己的家，却另外接到人傑的一封信。</p>
<p>「……我從前是一個自私的個人主義者，所以深深地在心裏要佔有着我的愛人曼麗全體，這是錯的。爲了她的走以至悲哀發狂，想起來更是可笑！老友，你如果有空，就寫封信給他，告訴她，曼麗自由的，人傑也是自由的了。……」</p>
<p>曼麗，他說，你是自由的，||你有離開他的自由，你更有不愛他的自由。可是，曼麗，你還有想念他的自由呵！</p>
<p>你現在如果已經了解他，那你也有因愛他想念他而生的寂寞，煩惱，愁悶，悲哀的自由呵！</p>
<p>你的愛人的老友陳嶽於上海寄。</p>

<h3>關於美國攝影隊來華　攝製「福地」影片之意見</h3>
<p>— 曹雲祥</p>
<p>近聞由喬治希爾所領導之美國攝影隊業已抵滬，將赴內地從事拍攝布爾克</p>
<p>夫人所著之「福地」。同時復聞南京內政部所屬之電影檢查會將監督該片之攝製。决不容其中有侮辱華人之情節，出版檢查權固爲各國政府所能有，但如我政府對於「福地」之攝製，執行檢查過嚴，則恐該片根本無完成之望矣。</p>
<p>著者之所以特將此一事件，提出討論者，因「福地」一書爲世界有名之文學作品，各方批評不一致。原書雖僅係描寫中國一平凡之農民，然在歐美各國銷行極盛，其他文學著作不能及也，其中叙述中國農民生活狀况，極盡細膩之至，而因此亦招中國一部份人士之反感，以爲書中所述盜匪，災荒，雅片與婢妾等情形，是不啻專於暴露中國之醜惡，而且有過甚其詞之處，惟吾人平心而論，關於風土人情，各國皆有善惡之兩面，而盜匪與災荒更非中國之專利品，且眞相之暴露，能使人們對於善善惡惡，有所警惕，而促其前進與改造之自覺，要亦爲文學之功益也，且此等等並非書中之主要文章，不過藉以陪襯故事而已，該書之所以能得泰西人士之歡迎，所以能使泰西人士對　中國能從書中得一較佳之印象者，乃中國人民之道德與王龍之人格也。</p>
<p>王龍雖目不識丁，貧無立錐之地，然固能由勤儉而成家，其爲大具决心，明是非，性仁慈，最後復能有良心上之悔改。使在其也各國造成王龍其人者，有賴於敎育，法律與宗敎，而王龍於此等等方面乃一無所依凖，然則造成其人袼之原素究安在耶：使中國四萬萬人民皆能如王龍之爲人，則中國之希望卽已無窮，如人民再能領受敎育，科學，法律，宗敎與政治之賜益，則其前途之偉大，世界各國將無有可與比倫者。吾以爲本書之中心意義，卽在宣示此點，亦卽上海泰晤士報之所謂「以援助中國於海外爲主旨」者也。</p>
<p>五龍爲一天眞爛漫之農民，自然有其弱點，但王龍之堅强意旨與正直之人格究何由而造成，此在「福地」中雖未明言，但在布克夫人之其他著作中，已指明王之品性實爲中國古敎之反映。王龍之人格之造成，乃由於父母之庭訓，鄉曲之遺敎，友朋之談論，以及親身所歷之艱苦。雖然中國文化由此所反映者係極小一部份，然總可證明中國有一種古訓，爲不可漠滅者。此爲中國文化之基礎，將來之新時代，卽建築在此種基礎之上。中國文化中之優異亦卽在此，此正中國所足以自豪者，於此方面，亦無容借他人之長，補己之短也。霍根敎授在雷夢報告書中亦稱此爲「建築在過去之上」該報告書結讑中且云「基督敎將與此種文化力量合作，因其有助於正義之逹到也」。</p>
<p>王之善良品性爲中國文化之基礎，中國雖僅有一孔子，但或有三萬萬衆之王龍，此卽爲量與質之比也。帮我政府當局應認清「福地」所負使命之重要，應認清「福地」攝成影片，將來放映各國，能使各國人民了解中國文化之力量，而同時亦希望拍攝者以宣布中國文化優美之點爲宗旨，如此則雙方之誤解，卽能消釋，而該片之攝製乃不至有阻礙也。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「歸宿」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>（天一出品　北京開映）</p>
<p>如以「三叉路口」或「邊海情潮」等影片相比，那末，「歸宿」到底是差强人意的作品了。</p>
<p>的確，「歸宿」的作者在有些地方表現出他的成功。</p>
<p>（一）悲劇的情感，在觀衆心中多少引起了悲愴的同情。當雪芬自旅館門口懷着破碎的心靈回到家裏的時候，她的毛毛已經死了。這種悲慘的境遇，是不會使人隔閡而深切體念得到。　　（二）雪芬在離開丈夫，悄悄的和情人私奔之前，她以顫抖的手給愛女蓋被的時候，那情愛與母愛的衝突，雖然仍嫌軟弱，（她應當爲了愛的熱情而相當表示出她的勇氣。）總算相當深刻。</p>
<p>（三）雪芬在九如門口再看到親手遺棄的愛女的時候，也是還可以的。</p>
<p>（四）再有一點，那便是對於故事的交代，頗爲清順。然而，自劇本以至於演出，到底有許多是値得商榷的地方。爲了個人對於中國電影的愛護起見，我决不敢隱藏自己對於「歸宿」的意見。也許，這微薄的意見，對於本片作家諸君，不是完全沒有幫助吧。</p>
<p>（一）我决不反對有價値而不離開現實的論理片，自然我們更迫切的希望中國電影作家對於人與人之間的關係，有看更進步的新的理解。但是，「歸宿」的作者對於後者完全沒有理解。他們對於社會機構並沒有眞正的認識，祗是非常傷感的，以比較幼稚的手法，描畫這近乎偶然的悲劇，（其實，現社會儘有着比這更普遍的眞實。）而沒有很好的把握其社會根據，並展開新的前途。</p>
<p>（二）如「歸宿」中所說的一樣，有不少覺悟的女性，在封建社會中，首先感到愛的苦悶，而大胆的追求她美麗的幻夢。但是自五四而後直到目前爲止，在幼弱的所謂工業時代的中國，特別是在經濟恐慌震撼了整個的社會，而又天災兵禍頻仍的現在，十分脆弱的現社會，並不能容納這些人們，於是，必然的演下了許多悲劇。這是非常嚴重的經濟問題。因此，「歸宿」的作者應當加強這一方面的認識。譬如說強調失業問題的嚴重，非常鮮明的說明愛情的金錢基礎。但是，本片的作者，却相反的僅在愛的兒戲上努力。特別是守中和李梨之間的糾紛，更是可笑。</p>
<p>（三）再具體一點說罷。我以爲雪芬自與守中結合之後，應該強調在失業問題上面。愛情雖然美滿，但是生活問題更爲迫切。這不妨寫到她和他因生活而疲憊，甚至於守中因勤勞與窮而至死。這樣，新生的毛毛也因窮病而死，却更襯出雪芬之悲哀了。而且，這樣一來，嚴密的接觸到眞實的社會問題。而完美的愛情，祗有在廢除了經濟束縛的社會中方能成功。</p>
<p>（四）我想「歸宿」的作者應該覺悟到守中和李梨之間的關係是不會存在的。李梨爲什麼要愛守中？守中爲什麼會接受李梨的愛？難道在李梨的眼光中，愛情果然是無條件的嗎？李梨不過是一個小小的「花瓶」，而守中也不過是一個可憐的寒酸。至於以一個女職員能够住在華貴的旅館中住家，到底是騙人的笑話。何況像「（「人生」中阮玲玉及林楚楚之表情）</p>
<p>春潮」中一樣的描寫富女之以金錢買愛情，也不過是無聊的把戲。所以，這一段穿插，根本就沒有必要。</p>
<p>（五）其他還有許多不完善的地方。譬如九如的轉變｜｜不冶遊而騖正業，沒有明顯的交待。雪芬何以會瞎眼？雪芬遇其與前夫所生之愛女時，應當在當時或事後加重劇的情感。雪芬自守中出走之後，應當加重她心理描寫，以及母愛之偉大。至於最後寫李梨和守中之情敵三人相遇時的沒落，那種大快人心之舉，却十分拙劣了。這種不僅是十分巧合，而李梨和另一男人，何以會如此潦倒的呢？眞是過於畫蛇添足了。他如字幕上「未嘗不是……」，寫成未「尙」「一年二年」等長長的過程，全無必要，因爲這無非是要使他們有生有小孩的時間，而第二年便生育也並不離奇。過了幾年的時間，守中仍是那套衣褲，雪芬也仍是那雙鞋子。……這些，都表現製作時的不小心。</p>
<p>（六）然而黃曼梨的表演技巧，却是非常好的，這自「夜半槍聲」中已可槪見，祗可惜在本片中沒有更多的表演機會。其他如賀指剛，和魏光壽（？）都還可以，唯有陳雁却給導演指揮成不成才的角色了。他如攝影技巧不壞。尤其是北京大戲院的配音，增加劇的情感不少。</p>

<p>To　The　Lagt　Man</p>
<p>在低级興趣的西部影片中，也許這是一部比較髙評價的作品。</p>
<p>世仇，幾代的世仇，慘殺，擄掠。其中是一善一惡，善者被欺侮，至官廳解决，其結果將殺人兇犯，僅判徒刑十五年。於是惡徒出獄之後，更結交匪徒，大事復仇。而這忠厚之家，因此死傷無算。殺父之仇，决非官廳所能解决，只好「以殺止殺」的直接訴諸武力。然而惡从之女，却與善人之子結了不解緣。愛情消滅了世仇。</p>
<p>在此，我們可看出作者意識形態的全部。祇有愛的力，才能超越一切。我想這中間沒有什麽是値得嚴格批判的，不是一切都說得非常明折麽？</p>
<p>戲是還好看的，假使我們降低自己的要求。除了戰爭的塲面，幾塲打武也很逼眞，尤其最後的故作驚人之筆，使那匪徒不死於手槍，而死於刀尖之下。</p>
<p>再有精采之處，那便是大殺之中，小孩兒冒險救羊，極力表現人類好善之天性。其次女郎將情人所贈的衣包，爲着世仇的緣故踢着回去，甚至於以火焚之而又急忙從火裏取出；這與以前幾次見仇人，而又是情人去後，悄悄的痛哭相聯繫着，那愛與恨之內心描寫，確是很生動的。此外，描寫那女人的個性，由於騎劣馬，穿破褲子，在池塘中洗澡，和情人相駡，都可看出她撒野而又天眞的性情。</p>
<p>缺點是叙述故事，不很流暢清順所謂剪接不嚴密。至於一個人出塲，必須加字幕說明，也是不必要的。各方面都恰和中國小公司的出品相似，但是技術方而，却髙明一些。</p>
<p>不過這種幼稚的打武影片，在不久的將來，將不免要遭觀衆們唾棄的。</p>

<h3>克利斯丁娜　Queen　Christina　(一）</h3>
<p>— 笏臣</p>
<p>（米高梅出品　葛雷泰嘉寳及約翰吉爾勃主演）</p>
<p>在瑞典京城史都克和姆的皇宫裏，那年靑的克利斯丁娜女王，正在處理着許多軍國大事檯上堆置着許多首相奧森斯提那送上來的奏章。她由疲倦而感覺到厭煩起來……這無時無刻的請求｜｜請求戰爭……請求和平……請求金錢……請求女王和他們軍隊的領袖｜｜查爾斯奧古斯德斯締結婚姻。她看着窗外的大雪，恨不得化身於那霏霏大雪之中，忘紀了自己……遺棄了世界……</p>
<p>查爾斯親王自戰塲上，打了勝仗回來，想向女王重提婚姻的請求。但女王延見了他，慶賀了他在疆塲上的戰績，很乖巧的規避了那個問題，並且將首相的屢次請求置之不理。首相奧森斯提那還是滔滔不絕地，奏陳她和查爾斯親王締婚的關係重大，可以轟動全國人民的愛國心，可以使議會通過加練新軍的預算案。同時度支大臣麥格納斯，亦鼓吹着女王早日締婚。幷且鼓吹着戰爭，但是女王克利斯丁娜總覺得格格不入耳。</p>
<p>克利斯丁娜對於戰爭，可說是深惡痛絕了。瑞典自建國以來，無時不在戰爭之中。她的父親，格斯泰夫斯，是死在洛森戰塲上的。……他將她當作男兒撫育大了，使她的耳朶，習聞巨砲之聲，想把她的精神，磨練得和他自己的精神一樣｜｜那種軍士的精神。她想遵從父命，但是……她堅強地說：「戰爭一定要有一個終結的時候。不然我們豈不回到野蠻時代了嗎！她說完了，四週起了一陣非難譏嘲之聲，但是克利斯丁娜等他們的聲音低下去了，她又繼續着說道：「這種高調唱完了是什麼？死亡與毀滅！我現在要我的人民訓練和平的藝術｜｜生命的藝術。我需要的是和平，我亦必得和平而得已！」她不顧一切的譏嘲，男子們的抗辯，她在和敵人媾和的條約上蓋上了一顆國王的印。</p>
<p>許多大臣來覲見着，許多無謂的紛爭辯論。英國的大使惠德錄爵士……法國的大使……等等，女王克利斯丁娜很爽快地將他們的事情，打發走了。到最後，大家都散了，祗有首相奧森斯提那還是矗立着不動。他說：「我不得不向陛下來一個警告，西班牙國王菲列的專使快要到了。他來此有一兩天的耽擱。你萬萬不可引起人民對於天主教婚儀的恐懼心。瑞典是新教國家。爲瑞典就是陛下的天職。」他這樣又轉到他對於女王婚姻問題上去了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Workers of Kailuan Four Mines Present Demands to the Mine Owners (Tianjin)</h3>
<p>On the 27th, workers from the Kailuan Tangshan Majiagou four mines presented nine demands to the mine owners, requiring their signature, otherwise vowing not to resume work. The main points of the nine demands are still to restore the trade union organization, remove the chief culprits, reinstate unemployed workers, and provide generous compensation to the families of deceased workers, which are roughly the same as those previously proposed by the workers of the Ma Mine. The mine owners have not yet responded. There has been no change since the workers' strike. Li, a section chief sent by the Civil Affairs Department to investigate, arrived in the Tangshan mining area on the 27th and is mediating. The Qinhuangdao Trade Union sent 2,000 bags of flour to the striking mining areas on the 27th to distribute to the workers, so the morale of the workers is even stronger.

<p>Yin Rugeng Stays in Yutian to Negotiate the Reorganization of the Mutinied Soldiers</p>
<p>(The Mutinied Soldiers' Demands are Very Harsh, and Yin Has Telegraphed the Province for Instructions)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the Yutian mutiny, Yin Rugeng went to Yanzihe Village on the 27th and summoned the county magistrates of Zunhua, Fengrun, Jixian, and Qian'an, as well as the leaders of the mutinied soldiers, Peng Zuyou, Hu Xie'wu, Zhang Futian, and Feng Shouchun, for a meeting. Peng did not attend, but Hu and Zhang each sent representatives to participate. The representatives of Hu and Zhang requested that the county militias be transferred back to their original defenses. In addition to surrendering the firearms of the Yutian militia, they should still support Peng Zuyou as their leader and expand the rebellious troops into three major battalions, increasing the number of soldiers to 2,000. They should not be transferred to other defense areas. Yin considered the conditions too harsh and telegraphed the provincial government for instructions. It is rumored that Dong Tianhua, the magistrate of Yutian County, has been placed under house arrest by the mutinied soldiers, but this has not been confirmed. The mutinied soldiers occupying Yanhong Bridge and Hongqiao Town, due to the encirclement and suppression by the militia, loaded merchandise from businesses onto large carts on the 27th and transported them to nearby towns and cities for dumping. Fearing an attack by the militia, they collected the account books of various shops, piled them on the city towers of the two towns, and placed firewood on them, declaring that if the militia attacked, they would set fire and escape. The merchants, because the account books were important, pleaded with the militia for a peaceful resolution. The security team stationed in the Linxi war zone has arrived near Yutian, awaiting orders to advance or retreat. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the sudden incident involving the Yutian regiment police, the Hebei Provincial Government has decided to transfer Zhang Futang's troops to another location, which will not be announced for the time being. Yin Rugeng is currently stationed in Yutian, contacting Hu Xie'wu and Zhang Futang. However, Zhang's attitude is still quite stubborn, and he has made several demands to Yin: expanding the quota for special police and ensuring that the location of future transfers is not outside the war zone. Yin has telegraphed Zhang's demands to the Hebei Provincial Government. Yu Xuezhong has ordered Li, a staff officer of the 51st Army, to negotiate with Zhang Futang and Yin Rugeng nearby. Their views are gradually converging. Yin will leave Yutian to inspect various counties only after the incident is resolved. According to people from Yutian, Zhang Futang's special police stationed in Yutian are still stationed in Yanhong Bridge. Zhang Futang himself has brought a small number of guards to Yutian City.

Important meetings may be proposed for discussion next week. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

Both were abandoned by Tibet. This time, they dared to falsely claim to be representatives sent by the three major monasteries and monk officials and civilians of Tibet, using clever words and drums to deceive and swagger everywhere, even going to various agencies to meet with the authorities and act as equals, carrying out deceptive means. In addition to submitting reports to the General Staff of the Military Council and the Mongol Association and other relevant agencies for thorough investigation and severe punishment, a telegram has also been sent to the Tibetan government to report.

<p>Chiang Kai-shek Scheduled to Meet Inner Mongolian Representatives Today</p>
<p>(The Representatives Plan to Issue a Long Declaration)</p>
<p>(Fu Zuoyi Telegraphed Wang Jingwei to Explain)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang is scheduled to meet with the Mongolian representatives on the morning of the 29th. The representatives plan to submit a long declaration detailing the situation in Inner Mongolia, which will be presented in person on the 29th. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi telegraphed President Wang on the 25th, saying, "According to reports, the Inner Mongolian representatives submitted a document to the Central Political Council stating that the Suiyuan Provincial Government reported to the Central Government that the League Leaders of Yikezhao League expressed their willingness to form an autonomous region with the League and not unite with the princes of the Eastern League, etc. All of this was fabricated by the Provincial Government. The representatives of the Yikezhao League have already clarified the truth in another document. It is verified that on January 6 of this year, League Leader Sha of Yikezhao League stated to this province that unifying with the Ulanqab League to form a government is not beneficial to the public and requested that it be forwarded to the Executive Yuan and the Mongol Association, etc., approving the special establishment of an autonomous region government, etc. There is a formal printed document from the League Leader and his personal seal can be verified. Also, a letter from the Deputy League Leader to this government states that after consultation with various Jasaks, they are all willing to establish an autonomous region government independently, and the attached letters to Minister Huang and Deputy Chairman Zhao also have A. Wang's seal as evidence. It is verified whether the representatives have this time presented the qualifications with the seal and document of the League Leader and Deputy League Leader when they paid respects to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry. Otherwise, if they are indeed representatives, how can the League Leader and Deputy League Leader request to form a government independently, while the representatives are completely opposed to it? Furthermore, A. Wang had previously represented the entire League when he met Minister Huang, and he had already presented the views of the League in person, which is known to everyone. How can he claim to be a representative of the Yikezhao League but contradict the public opinion of the League? This government had no choice but to forward it because it received the printed documents of the Sha and A. Leagues. However, the representatives claimed that it was fabricated by the Suiyuan Provincial Government, which is a reckless speculation. In addition to submitting the various documents separately, I am now submitting them in a special telegram at the time when the Central Political Council is resolving this case, clarifying the facts. If there is a need to make it public to society, I hope that the Executive Yuan will choose to publish it to avoid confusion." (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Internal Strife in the Audit Department</p>
<p>(Most Auditors Oppose Li Yuanding)</p>
<p>(All Supervisory Committee Members Plan to Issue a Warning)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Audit Minister Li Yuanding had conflicts with most auditors over the authority of the audit meeting and other matters. The entire staff went on strike for many days. Although President Yu Youren intervened to mediate, they have not yet returned to work. Li Yuanding believes that reducing the authority of the audit meeting is legal, and opposition is illegal. The auditors believe that Li used personal connections and abused his authority and should be impeached by the Supervisory Yuan and subjected to disciplinary action, otherwise, it will be difficult to return to work. The two sides are in a stalemate. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The strike in the Audit Department has not yet subsided. According to a Supervisory Committee member, the entire Supervisory Committee believes that the Audit Department is an agency under the jurisdiction of the Supervisory Yuan, and it is disgraceful that such a thing has happened. It is now planned to issue a warning. If it is ineffective, impeachment will be proposed to maintain official discipline. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

However, the implementation will be a matter of time. These three proposals are considered by the comrades in the Southwest to be an essential plan to save the country. Now that they have been approved, I have no other opinions to express besides feeling satisfied. I will go to Shanghai and stay for a few days before returning to Guangdong by ship to personally report the progress of this trip to the comrades in the Southwest in order to complete the task.

<p>(Hankou) The remnants of the bandits in southern Henan, Yang, Ma, Xiao, Gu, and other groups, are causing disturbances in Luoshan, Qiliping, Daguadian, Shuangqiaopu, Erlangfan, and other places. After Xiao Zhichu joined forces with friendly troops to encircle and suppress them, they fled westward across the Pinghan Railway between Guangshui and Wangjiadian on the evening of the 25th. Rong Jingfang's division and the road protection troops are pursuing them. Rong arrived in Guangshui on the 28th to take command. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Stalin Predicts Future War at the Communist Party Congress</p>
<p>(Conflicts Inevitable as Countries Compete to Expand Armaments)</p>
<p>(China, Under Pressure, Will Eventually Strive for Self-Improvement)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Communist Party Secretary Stalin reported to the Communist Party Congress today, predicting a world war and saying that the atmosphere of retaliatory wars has permeated capitalist countries. China and Japan will also fight in Manchuria. Japan's invasion of North China has made the situation between China and Japan increasingly serious. At the same time, the expansion of the navies and armies of Japan, the United States, Britain, and France will eventually lead to a fierce battle for supremacy in the Pacific. Stalin also spoke about other matters, denying that the Soviet government was responsible for the breakdown of negotiations on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, saying that the Soviet government wanted to strive to improve relations with Japan. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Stalin said in a speech at the Communist Party Congress yesterday that Japan's occupation of Manchuria, withdrawal from the League of Nations, and aggression in North China have made the international situation increasingly acute. Now, the warmongers of imperialism are preparing for war as a revenge plan, almost no different from before the Great War of 1941. Therefore, the current situation will lead to a second world war. Some bourgeois politicians often believe that to solve the current difficulties, they only need to fight against weaker countries such as China and obtain good markets through aggressive means. They want to divide China and enrich themselves. We still remember that at the beginning of the 19th century, the European powers viewed Germany and Italy as the powers view China today. However, the people of Germany and Italy were eventually able to work hard and unite and strengthen themselves to drive the enemy out of the country. The current situation is slightly similar to the beginning of the 19th century. Can we guarantee that the Chinese people, when subjected to the extreme oppression of imperialism, cannot also work hard and unite and strengthen themselves?

<p>US Expands Air Force Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>(Add 1,000 Aircraft)</p>
<p>(Recruit 6,000 Soldiers)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the Army authorities officially announced their new "Five-Year Plan" for the Army Air Corps, stipulating the addition of 1,000 new fighter jets, the assignment of 400 regular army officers, and the recruitment of 6,200 enlisted men to join the corps. Army Chief Dunne has approved this plan and will submit it to the Military Committees of the House and Senate. It is reported that the plan will cost more than 30 million US dollars. According to the memorandum prepared by the Army General Staff, although the US Army currently has as many as 1,800 aircraft, it is still insufficient for both domestic and foreign needs. In addition to ordering 100 fighter jets this month, which will cost 7.5 million US dollars, which has been allocated from the public works department's storage funds, the General Staff and the Army Minister have repeatedly requested Congress to expand the Air Force, but they have not been approved. This time, they hope that Congress will give special consideration to the new plan to add 1,000 aircraft. If it can be implemented, it will not only benefit national defense but also provide relief to thousands of unemployed workers. (National Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>The Issue of Disarmament</p>
<p>Germany is the Key to Success or Failure</p>
<p>(Franco-German Suspicion Makes Direct Negotiations Hopeless)</p>
<p>(The Task of Mediation Clearly Belongs to Britain)</p>
<p>(London) Those with sensitive news in Berlin claim that the success or failure of the National Socialist Party will depend on how it handles the disarmament issue. Germany's six million unemployed are in urgent need of work. Germany may use the manufacture of armaments to settle these people, so unemployment is the key to Germany's attitude towards disarmament. Although there is no official information on how Germany will respond to France, there is no doubt that Germany will still demand equality in armaments with other countries, and France will certainly not abandon its proposal for an international management trial period. Franco-German suspicion makes the progress of direct negotiations seem hopeless. Therefore, the future result will probably be one of two: either the breakdown of disarmament talks and the competition to re-establish armaments, or France will appeal to the League of Nations. It is heard that Germany has indicated to Britain that it wants Britain to take on the role of mediator. Berliners predict that if Britain agrees to act as mediator, Italy can assist Germany. Because of this, the discussion by British Foreign Secretary Simon in the Lower House next Monday is very noteworthy. However, the situation is extremely complicated, and the British Foreign Secretary may not hastily make statements that could bind the British government. Many believe that Britain's call to action today can be effective. Even if it is not, it is still better than sitting on the fence and watching. Germany's last resort may be to use its unemployed to manufacture armaments, and this danger is almost unavoidable. At the same time, there is a ray of light: the newly established non-aggression agreement between Germany and Poland, in which they agree not to resort to force in any disputes within the next ten years. According to this, Germany's long-standing resentment over the Polish corridor has now clearly disappeared. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>European Countries Express Joy Over New German-Polish Treaty</p>
<p>(Considered a Sign of Germany's Inclination Towards Peace)</p>
<p>(London) The non-aggression agreement signed between Germany and Poland was signed yesterday, and all European capitals expressed joy. The German newspapers all welcomed it excitedly, saying that Chancellor Hitler was the initiator of this supreme achievement of pacifism. The establishment of the agreement is sufficient to show Hitler's determination for peace and the direction of his diplomatic policy. The peace cause achieved by Germany and Poland has surpassed what diplomats from various countries have done in the past thirteen years. The Polish government's official newspaper, Polska, said that the relationship of the agreement is very important and may be the final step towards the stability of the German-Polish border. French Foreign Minister Peng Gu also expressed satisfaction with this agreement, saying that in addition to stipulating the peaceful resolution of all German-Polish issues, it is also sufficient to maintain the various obligations previously agreed upon. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) When meeting with reporters today, French Foreign Minister Peng Gu expressed satisfaction with the non-aggression treaty between Germany and Poland. He said that everyone should be satisfied with this step. From now on, the relationship between the two countries will have an extremely friendly rule to follow. Furthermore, after the establishment of this treaty, not only the original relationship between France and Poland will be maintained, but also the provisions in the German-Polish arbitration treaty and the League of Nations covenant will not be affected. Therefore, this new treaty is tantamount to a restoration of international cooperation, which is also the policy that the French government has been seeking for many years. Peng Gu then explained the contents of the telegram sent by Polish Foreign Minister Beck, which was forwarded to Peng Gu by the Polish ambassador to Paris. The telegram pointed out that there is a provision in the new German-Polish treaty that all previous treaties will not be affected by the new treaty. Peng Gu then discussed the current relationship between Germany and France. He expressed deep regret for the delays in recent negotiations caused by the cabinet turmoil in France, but promised to respond to Germany's last reply as soon as possible.

<p>Local News: The Entire City Lowered Flags Yesterday, Mournfully Commemorating "January 28th" (Various Circles Held Commemorative Meetings Yesterday) (Party Headquarters in Seven Districts Also Held Public Memorial Services at the Cemetery of Martyrs) (The Entire City Was Under Tight Security to Prevent Disturbances) Yesterday was the second anniversary of the mournful January 28th Songhu Anti-Japanese War. All circles in the city lowered flags and suspended entertainment to express condolences. In addition, the Municipal Party Headquarters held a commemorative meeting at the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Corps at 9:00 AM, gathering representatives from all walks of life. The Party Headquarters in the seven districts also held public memorial services at the "January 28th" Cemetery of Martyrs. The authorities of the Chinese Concession Police Department strengthened security and increased patrols at key locations to prevent disturbances. The details are as follows: Commemorative Meeting The commemorative meeting was held at the Youth Propaganda Corps at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched a squad of armed police to guard the surrounding area of the venue. A white cloth banner was hung in front of the venue, reading "Shanghai Various Circles Hold the Second Anniversary Commemorative Meeting of the January 28th Songhu National Army's Anti-Japanese War." The portrait of the Premier and the national flag were hung in the hall, with slogans posted on both sides. The presidium consisted of five people: Xing Wan from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Chen Kecheng from the Municipal Government, Wang Yansong from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhu Xuefan from the General Labor Union, and Ren Xianqun from the University Federation. Zhang Hanyun served as the master of ceremonies, and Tong Muge as the recorder. The Public Security Bureau's military band played mournful music. Representatives Attending The attendees included Xing Wan and He Yuanming from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Chen Kecheng from the Municipal Government, Wen Hongen from the Public Security Bureau (represented by Li Zemin), Qiu Yunming and Chen Hao from the Land Bureau, Sheng Yizhang from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Lu Youchang and Wang Zongjian from the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, Wang Yansong from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhu Xuefan and Zhou Xuexiang from the General Labor Union, Huang Zaoxiong from the Municipal Education Association, Zhu YaKui from the Labor Education Association, Zhu Guilin from the Social Affairs Bureau, Ren Xianzhang from the University Federation, Shen Xinglin from the Middle School Federation, Mao Yun from the Second Special District Citizens' Federation, Xu Genghua from the Chinese National Products Maintenance Association, the Sixth District Tea Industry Industrial Association, the Fifth District Cotton Textile Industry Association, the Shanghai South District Farmers' Association, the Industrial Association, the Jinan University Student Union, Junyi Middle School, Yuqing Middle School, Qinyi Elementary School, and other representatives, totaling over a hundred people. Chairman's Report After the rituals were completed, Chairman Xing Wan gave a report, stating that today is the second anniversary of the January 28th Songhu National Army's Anti-Japanese War. The value of this war lies in opening a new record in history and is a very meaningful war to resist imperialism. It also reduces the public's timid mentality. However, commemorating its significance is not as simple as shouting slogans and posting banners. We must always remember the spirit of the anti-Japanese soldiers and continue to work hard, vowing to fight to the death against Japanese imperialism. However, there must be two conditions: (1) Strengthen military preparations, because now is the time to talk about force. It is absolutely impossible to recover lost territory by peaceful means. If military preparations are not strengthened, even if force is used, it will not be able to defeat the imperialists. Looking at countries around the world, they are all scheming against each other, seeking their own way out. The United States has news of adding one hundred and twenty warships and concentrating all its military power in the Far East. Japan is also actively preparing. Although our country's army has more than one million on the surface, the shortage of military equipment and the lack of food must be strengthened. (2) Consolidate the rear. To resist foreign aggression, we must first consolidate the rear. Recalling January 28th, the communist bandits in the rear engaged in sabotage, making it impossible to take care of both front and rear. Therefore, to thoroughly resist Japan, we must first eliminate the communist bandits. I hope that our citizens will jointly support the central government and unite to resist Japan and suppress the communists. Then, Wang Yansong from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Ren Xianzhang from the University Federation, and Shen Xinglin from the Middle School Federation gave speeches. (Details omitted) The meeting adjourned with slogans. Expressing Condolences and Public Memorial Services The Municipal Government and its affiliated agencies, the Garrison Headquarters, all levels of the Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and the two Railway Administrations, the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, and other agencies, as well as all shops and factories in the city, except for sending representatives to participate in the commemorative meeting, all lowered flags to express condolences. All game venues suspended entertainment. At 11:00 AM, all citizens observed three minutes of silence to express condolences to the anti-Japanese martyrs and the compatriots who died in the disaster. The Party Headquarters in the seven districts also led all walks of life to the "January 28th" Cemetery of Martyrs in Changgouwan, Huayuan Road, Jiangwan, to hold public memorial services. Many people went to pay their respects. The Seventh General Administration of the Public Security Bureau specially dispatched a squad of armed police to strictly guard the surrounding area. January 28th Commemorative Meeting Chen Jiazhen (photograph) Citywide Alert Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, in order to prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble, specially ordered the district offices to strengthen security. After receiving the order, the district chiefs and police officers increased double-post guards at key locations. All detectives from the Public Security Bureau were dispatched to patrol and inspect pedestrians on the roads. The naval guard battalion also deployed sentries in the Gaochang Temple area. The garrison headquarters sent teams to patrol back and forth in Longhua, Xietu Road, and other places. Soldiers and members of the Municipal Security Office and the Defense Corps were deployed at key intersections, and security was quite strict. The Public Concession and the French Concession Police Department also increased Chinese and foreign detectives in the factory areas of West Shanghai, East Shanghai, and Hongkou to strengthen security. Shanghai South National Products Exhibition Opened Yesterday (More Than 1,300 Guests Attended) (Du Yuesheng Raised the Flag, Tang Guanyu Opened the Gate) The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Saving National Products held the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition, organized according to the meeting plan, at 11:00 AM yesterday at the Sixteenth Pier Guoma Road. Du Yuesheng raised the flag, and Ms. Tang Guanyu, wife of Pan Gongzhan, opened the gate. Representatives from all walks of life, factory staff, and guests, totaling about 1,300 people, attended, making it a grand occasion. A Glimpse of the Venue The venue was set up on the vacant land of the Quanzhang Guild Hall on Sixteenth Pier Guoma Road. Zheng Liankun, a famous architect from West Shanghai, supervised the construction of the reed fences day and night, and the layout was simple and modern. The factories participating this time were very enthusiastic, with a total of 65 industries and 92 factories. The entire factory had a total of 128 rooms, implying the promotion of national products and the hope of washing away the national shame of January 28th, with profound and vigilant intentions. The entire venue and archway lights were supplied by the Yapu'er Electric Appliance Factory. The decorations of each factory were ingenious and beautiful. Inside and outside the venue, Hu Yuzao, the chief of the First General Administration of the Public Security Bureau, led 20 police officers, and Gao Ziyun, the captain of the First Team of the Defense Corps, led a squad of members to maintain order. The East District First Defense Station of the Fire Brigade also dispatched firefighters and fire extinguishers to be stationed at the venue to prevent any emergencies.

Led by the military band, all the guests entered the venue in an orderly manner and toured the venue. The staff of each factory bowed and paid their respects, extremely solemn and respectful. They then retreated to the reception room, had tea and snacks, and dispersed. Chairman's Speech Chairman Chen Yiting delivered the opening speech, saying, "Promoting national products is a fundamental task for saving the country under the severe situation of national crisis and foreign goods dumping. Our association upholds the teachings of the Premier and the leadership of the Party and government, and strives for the national products movement without wavering. Today, we are holding the opening ceremony of the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition, an annual exhibition in our city. Representatives from the Party and government and guests from all walks of life braved the heavy frost and severe cold to enthusiastically participate, and we are deeply grateful for their enthusiasm for national products. The significance of holding the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition on the mournful second anniversary of January 28th is (1) to promote the citizens to not forget the January 28th invasion by violent Japan and intensify the promotion of national products to avenge national shame among the masses; (2) to expand the publicity of the Women's National Products Year, awaken women in the city, lead women across the country, implement the use of national products, and develop the economy. I hope that all of you present will jointly be responsible, do your best to promote the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition, promote cooperation between production and sales, and cultivate the national foundation." (Opening of the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition) (Photo courtesy of the China United News Agency) Widespread Publicity In order to achieve widespread publicity, in addition to posting alert slogans at the venue and sending people to Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, West Shanghai, and the two concessions to post large-scale color advertisements and distribute leaflets, the National Products Association also compiled and printed a special issue of the venue, which was distributed to guests. The contents included the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition Declaration, as well as Sun Daosheng's "The Shanghai South National Products Exhibition and January 28th," Xu Jianruo's "The Shanghai South National Products Exhibition and the Promotion of National Products," Zhang Deqi's "My Hope for the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition," Chen Binghui's "The Shanghai South National Products Exhibition of the Women's National Products Year," Xu Yunhui's "The Shanghai South National Products Exhibition and the National Salvation Movement," Chen Jusheng's "The Value of the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition," Zhao Bingren's "National Products Need to Be Promoted by Shanghai's Modern Women," and Lin Guyun's "A True Account of the Preparation for the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition," and other more than ten excellent articles, highlighting the true meaning of promoting national products, with many pertinent and moving observations. Two Railway Party Headquarters Held a General Meeting Yesterday (Commemorating the Songhu Anti-Japanese War) (Promoting the National Products Movement) The Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the two Railway Administrations, and the trade unions of the two railways and other agencies and employee organizations convened a general meeting of party members and representatives of trade unions and other organizations at 10:00 AM yesterday (January 28) to commemorate the second anniversary of the January 28 Songhu Anti-Japanese War and a general meeting to promote the national products movement. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows: Meeting Situation The meeting was held in the auditorium of the two railway party headquarters. More than 300 party members from the entire railway and representatives of trade unions and employee organizations from the railway administration signed in. Zou Zhengjian was the chairman, Huang Rui was the recorder, and Wang Cheng was the master of ceremonies. The meeting agenda was: (1) All stand at attention; (2) Sing the Party Song; (3) Pay the highest respect to the national flag, the portrait of the Premier, and the martyrs who died in the January 28 Songhu Anti-Japanese War; (4) Chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; (5) Observe five minutes of silence; (6) Report; (7) Speeches; (8) Shout slogans; (9) Adjourn. Chairman's Report After leading the ceremony, Chairman Zou Zhengjian gave an impromptu report, saying that today's meeting to commemorate the second anniversary of the January 28 Songhu Anti-Japanese War and to promote the national products movement is of great and far-reaching significance and value. When the January 28 incident occurred, our railway bore the brunt, so there were more employee deaths and injuries. We only need to reflect on the pain and recall the situation at that time, which is enough to strengthen our determination and movement to resist Japan and save the country and boycott foreign goods. Representatives' Speeches After the chairman's report, Secretary Fan Shouzhi of the Railway Administration gave a speech, stating that the purpose of holding these two opportunities is to create a phenomenon of national wealth and strength. The so-called national wealth and strength and people's strength and national wealth are mutually causal. We only need to strive to realize it, and the future of the country has great hope. Subsequently, Yuan Boyang, Deputy Director of the General Affairs Office of the Railway Administration, gave a speech, the main idea of which was as follows: All imperialists have the same goal of aggression towards weak nations. For example, the Shanghai May 30 Massacre in 1925 and the Wan'an Massacre are ironclad precedents. The goal of our efforts in the future is not only one enemy, the Japanese invaders. Other imperialists who also invade our country are all enemies. Therefore, boycotting foreign goods is not only a single Japanese product, but we must also resolve to boycott other foreign goods. Then, Committee Member Li Dasan gave a speech, the meaning of which was as follows: To promote national products, we must first lead by example and improve the quality of national products. Secretary Xie Chengyu gave another speech, the main points of which were as follows: (1) An army that is loyal to the ideology and loyal to the country will be able to shoulder the great responsibility of resisting Japan and saving the country; (2) The prerequisite for promoting national products is to lead by example; (3) Daily necessities must be self-made to create a self-sufficient environment. Finally, Zhang Yunhe gave a speech, saying that the dumping of foreign goods must have its adapted objective conditions, and our promotion of national products today must also be based on the needs of society. Moreover, those who promote the national products movement should avoid the unwise and unfair attitudes and actions of the past, and the national products movement of the two railways should first start with party members before it can be extended to all employees. Stations Held In order to make the employees and comrades of the two railway stations understand the purpose and practical effect of promoting national products, the two railway party headquarters organized a propaganda team, with two people as a team, totaling four teams. Starting from the 29th of this month, they will hold national products propaganda meetings separately at major stations along the line such as Suzhou, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Zhakou, Ningbo, and Baisha, in order to be universal. Zhang Zhiben Talks About His Feelings on the Fourth Plenary Session (If the Previous Mistakes Are Not Repeated After This Conference) (Then National Salvation and Survival Can Be Expected and the Country Has Hope) Xin Xin News Agency reports that Central Committee member Zhang Zhiben returned to Shanghai by night express train from Beijing yesterday morning after attending the Fourth Plenary Session. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency specially visited his residence to ask about the course and impressions of the plenary session. According to his talk, it was as follows: Southwestern Proposals Mr. Zhang first said that he had also co-signed the proposals of the southwestern members. The content was mostly based on the propositions in Mr. Hu Hanmin's declaration. Except for a part that was reviewed and deleted, the rest were passed, as reported. As for the "Concentrate Efforts to Save the Crisis" case proposed by Mr. Cheng Songyun (Qian), it was reviewed by the military group and submitted to the conference. It was passed and handed over to the National Defense Committee for research and handling. Reforming the Provincial System Continuing to talk about the case of reforming the provincial system, it has been resolved by the previous conference. What was discussed at this conference was to promote its realization, such as whether to add a deputy governor in addition to the governor, whether the names of the departments under the provincial government should still be uniformly named halls, or whether a part should be renamed as divisions, etc. As for the candidates for the governors of various provinces in the future, before constitutional government is implemented, they will of course still be directly appointed by the central government. Saving the Crisis Finally, the reporter asked about his feelings on the plenary session. Mr. Zhang expressed that the declaration of the conference clearly stated that the great plan for national salvation and survival lies in (1) national salvation and survival cannot be achieved without concentrating national power; (2) national salvation and survival cannot be achieved without strengthening national power. The meaning is obvious and need not be repeated. All the cases and policies proposed and resolved by previous conferences were all perfect, but unfortunately, they were mostly unable to be implemented. If the "resolutions without implementation" mistakes are not repeated after this conference, then "national salvation and survival" can be expected and the country has hope. Tang Youren Talks About Diplomacy (Still Based on Consistent Policy) Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. After a short rest, he was scheduled to return to Beijing by night express train last night to take up his duties. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited Mr. Tang at his residence to discuss various items as follows: (Consistent Diplomacy) According to Mr. Tang, the various committees at this Fourth Plenary Session were all sincere and friendly with each other, and the situation was very good. A total of about 70 proposals were made this time, with very few related to political diplomacy. Most of them were concentrated on economic development and national railway construction issues, because construction to save the country is a consistent goal. Therefore, in terms of politics, President Wang made a general report on domestic and foreign affairs, and other proposals related to this type were revised and passed according to the review results. In terms of diplomacy, it is still based on a consistent policy. As for the renewal and revision of the Sino-Italian commercial treaty upon its expiration, there is currently no way to report it. (Mongolian Autonomy) He went on to say that the government believes that the measures discussed by Minister Huang with them in Bailingmiao regarding the Mongolian issue and brought to Beijing are still worth considering and implementing. However, the representatives sent by Mongolia this time suddenly changed their minds, which was very different from the measures discussed by Minister Huang in Bailingmiao. However, since these representatives were sent as representatives of their masters, how can they overturn their previous agreements? Therefore, the government decided to enlighten these representatives so that they would still proceed according to the measures discussed in Bailingmiao. (Xinjiang Issue) As for the news spread by the Tass News Agency about the instability in the Kashgar area, although there have been similar rumors from all sides, the government has not yet received a report from the authorities of that province. It is impossible to speculate on what is going on, but the government has paid close attention to this matter and has now sent personnel to investigate the truth. (The Fujian Rebellion Will Soon Be Suppressed) Subsequently, he talked freely, saying that the 19th Route Army's rebellion this time thought that the central government was focusing all its efforts on suppressing the communists in Jiangxi Province and would have no remaining strength to suppress them. Even if troops were sent, they would only be defensive and would not mobilize a large army to launch a major attack. Therefore, they dared to advocate independence and confront the central government. At the same time, they believed that with the communist bandits restraining the government, they would be able to survive for two or three months. Therefore, the soldiers lacked fighting spirit, and even the rebel leaders never dared to truly fight. It is appropriate that they brought about their own destruction so quickly. There are now very few remnants, and they will soon be completely quelled. [P Mr. Yang Dezhao Discusses the Fourth Plenary Session (The Southwestern Proposals Passed in Principle) (The 19th Route Army Was Generally Treated with Lenience Because of Its Past History) (The Guangdong Army Has Not Yet Reached Longyan on the Fujian Border) Guowen News Agency reports that Yang Dezhao, the representative of the Guangdong Chen Jiye stationed in Beijing, went to Shanghai with Huang Xuchu and other southwestern members of the Central Committee. The next day, he went to Beijing to meet with Chairman Jiang and President Wang to report on the situation in Guangdong Province. At the same time, because the Fourth Plenary Session was opening, Guangdong Committee member Zou Lu had a proposal to expand Zhongshan University, so he entrusted him with carrying a large number of books to Beijing to be distributed to the committee members for reference, totaling three wooden boxes. The content fully described the plans to expand Zhongshan University. Now, Mr. Yang has come to Shanghai due to busy contact matters. This afternoon, a reporter visited his residence and discussed various matters with him. Mr. Yang said that he has already met with Chairman Jiang and President Wang. The southwestern provinces only submitted two proposals to the Fourth Plenary Session, one was the proposal to expand Zhongshan University proposed by Mr. Zou Haibin, and the other was the proposal on the current situation based on Mr. Hu's declaration. Now, all the proposals have been passed in principle. There are no other proposals submitted. I have not seen the original text of the proposals either. In total, the content of the two proposals is as reported, that is, the expansion of Zhongshan University requires 25 million yuan, etc. As for the Fujian Province issue, in terms of military affairs, Chairman Jiang and Mr. Chen Bonan usually exchange telegrams. I have not received any news. In short, the 19th Route Army had close relations with the Party and the country in the past. Today, it is mistaken by the erroneous actions of a few people. Therefore, when the war broke out, its lower-level officers were deeply aware of the righteousness and did not want to sacrifice the entire army for the sake of a few people. Because of this past history, all parties generally advocated lenient treatment. The departure of the Guangdong army is only limited to the Guangdong border to prevent scattered troops from fleeing and causing trouble. They have not yet reached Longyan in Fujian Province. The follow-up will be handled by the central government. Also, Guangdong Province feels that its finances are insufficient. However, recently, seeing that the social economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, it is even more difficult than before. For example, the ratio of income and expenditure in Guangdong Province last year will be a huge difference of one-third. Some people advocate borrowing money from outside to make up for this, but borrowing to make up for it is not a fundamental solution. The fundamental solution is to revive the economy. Therefore, the previously rumored borrowing matter has now been shelved and is no longer discussed. I do not plan to return to Guangdong recently. I will stay in Shanghai for two or three days and then go to Beijing.</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the relief of Pingluo, Ma Kui's cavalry brigade of the Ningxia Provincial Army, on the 26th, rushed from Pingluo to Wangye Temple, detoured to the Dakou area between Shizuizi and Dengkou, and took an intercepting posture against Sun's troops. Sun's troops, due to the interruption of their rear route, crossed the river and retreated to the area north of Woye on the east bank of the Yellow River. Sun himself led Liu Yueting's brigade to command military affairs in the Huangqu Bridge area between Shizuizi and Pingluo. Later, seeing the victory of the Ningxia army's counterattack, on the 27th, he led his troops to retreat to the east bank of the Yellow River. Currently, except for a portion of Sun's troops withdrawing to Dengkou, most are reorganizing in the Woye area on the east bank of the river. When Sun's troops retreated to the east bank of the Yellow River, due to the fierce artillery fire of the pursuing troops and the surface of the water being frozen and mostly broken, many of Sun's troops fell into the water and drowned.

<p>(Beiping) A Beijing telegram relayed a telegram from He, saying that after the issuance of a telegram ordering both sides to cease the Sun-Ma conflict, the situation is now trending towards moderation. However, regarding the issue of the location of Sun's troops, please designate it immediately so that the order can be relayed to Sun's troops for compliance, and so on. According to a certain gentleman, Secretary of He, He has not recently sent such a telegram to Beijing. External rumors are inaccurate. (Twenty-Eighth Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Before Sun's army advanced westward, it greatly expanded its forces. According to the army's original application to the military branch, it only had one division, with each division commanding two brigades, each brigade having three regiments, and an additional supplementary regiment, totaling seven infantry regiments and five special operations battalions and companies. According to investigations, the army now has four infantry divisions and one supplementary brigade, approximately 25 infantry regiments, three cavalry divisions, three cavalry brigades, and one independent regiment, approximately 16 cavalry regiments, plus one artillery regiment and five special operations battalions. The organization of the army's infantry division is that each brigade commands two regiments, and the cavalry division commands three regiments per brigade. (Twenty-Eighth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Ning and Qing armies are pursuing Sun's army eastward while taking advantage of their victory. Sun's army will eventually gather in the Houtao area. Ma Hongkui's goal is to drive Sun's army out of Ningxia Province, so Sun's army is retreating and not being pursued relentlessly. Sun has a large amount of grain stored in Wuyuan and Linhe, which can last for a considerable period of time. (Twenty-Eighth Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hou Cheng, the representative sent by He Yingqin to Bing to meet with Yan, decided to stay in Jin temporarily because Jin and Yan did not have concrete measures regarding the Sun-Ma conflict. Sun Dianying sent two telegrams to Wang Shiping, the director of his Beiping office, stating that he had already complied with the order to stop the advance of various units, and requested that this be reported to He. (Twenty-Eighth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Dianying telegraphed the Military Council, Military Department, and General Staff on the 27th, stating that he had received Minister He's order and immediately ordered his subordinates to comply and stop. In recent days, Ning's side has continued to provoke, intending to take the opportunity of the army's compliance with the order to stop, to exert pressure. However, he has strived to avoid contact and has not retaliated. If the pressure becomes too tight in the future and the war starts again, the responsibility will lie with them. He respectfully states this in advance, and the authorities will surely understand. Reporting battles behind closed doors and maliciously creating propaganda, fearing that the situation is not big enough, and attempting to deceive others, he cannot bear to do and disdains to do. He is still awaiting the authorities' decision and instructions on how to handle the situation and will comply accordingly. (Twenty-Eighth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the outbreak of the conflict between Sun and Ma's troops, more than two weeks have passed. Sun's troops are driving as hungry soldiers, and it is difficult to supply them. Furthermore, due to the severe cold in the border region, the soldiers have no clothes or food, and are suffering from cold and hunger, so the number of deaths is particularly high. In recent days, they have been attacked by Ning's army, and have collapsed simultaneously on both the east and west routes. The siege of Pingluo Ligang Fort has been lifted. Ning's army will first reorganize locally and will not pursue forward for the time being. Sun plans to lead his troops to retreat and defend the Woye and Wu Lin area.

<h3>Last Year's Overview of Shipping Companies on the Yangtze River Route</h3>
<p>(More Losses Than Profits)</p>
<p>(There Are Currently One Hundred Steamers on the Yangtze River)</p>
<p>(Japanese Ships Reduced by Three-Quarters)</p>
<p>Last year, all industries in Shanghai were depressed, and shipping companies were the most affected. Whether it was foreign, coastal, or the Yangtze River or inland rivers, it was not easy to maintain the status quo and avoid losses. Among the various shipping companies, most suffered losses. Even on the Yangtze River route, which has the best conditions, there was a situation of too many ships and too little cargo, and excess tonnage last year. Six companies in Shanghai have the largest operations on this route. The operating conditions of each company last year are described separately below.</p>
<p>(China Merchants Steam Navigation Company)</p>
<p>The Yangtze River shipping of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the main basic route, with a total of four first-class steamers and seven second-class steamers, operating on three routes upstream and downstream. When the six companies met last year to reduce ships on the Shanghai-Hankou route, the Jiangtian and Jiangyu ships were rented to the Central Government for official use, and the Jiangjing ship was leased to Dada to operate on the Tongyang River. Only six ships were regularly traveling on scheduled routes. The Emei and Kuaili ships sail upstream. Last year, after the bureau rigorously implemented the reporting and sales system for branches, and strictly controlled the slightly packaged goods, and the fish buckets were turned over to the bureau for collection, the shipping rates increased greatly. The company, which had always ranked third among the six companies, jumped to first place. However, the accident of the Emei ship, with losses of more than 100,000 yuan, made it impossible for the Beijing-Hankou express train to operate. However, based on an overall calculation, the company's Yangtze River steamers can still make a profit. According to the original intention of the Ship Section, three new Yangtze River steamers need to be added to the Yangtze River, and two 500-ton steamers need to be built to expand upstream. However, after the Gengzi Indemnity shipbuilding meeting, it was decided that only two Yangtze River ships could be added. Generally, expansion and development can only be carried out after the autumn of this year.</p>
<p>(Sanbei Company)</p>
<p>The total tonnage of all ships of Sanbei Shipping Company has exceeded that of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. All seagoing vessels, except for the Hengshan for its own use, are rented out. The number of ships used on the Yangtze River is actually more than that of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Since Shen Zhongyi joined the company and operated the Yangtze River route last year, the operating efficiency has increased sharply. In times of cargo congestion, eight ships are often sent back and forth. Upstream operations seem to be inferior to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but downstream cargo accounts for the first place among the six companies. Sanbei alone undertakes the transportation of rice, grain, rapeseed, etc. from Hunan and Anhui. On the upper Yangtze River, it occupies a special position in Hunan. When the number of ships was reduced last year, Changan and Dexing were rented to the Central Government, and Sanbei also dispatched ships many times to supply military service, which also took advantage of the excess tonnage and collected rent as a subsidy. According to the company's estimate, the Yangtze River route seems to be able to earn a surplus of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan last year, but the Qingpu ship was stranded, the Wanxiang ship caused an accident, and the Hengshan ship collided with another ship. Unfortunate events occurred repeatedly, and the losses also reached more than 100,000 yuan. Now, on the upper Yangtze River, six ships have been connected in Shayi, Yichang, Chongqing, and Hunan, so the water and land combined transportation on the Wuhan-Changsha route will be obtained by the company.</p>
<p>(Taikoo Company)</p>
<p>Taikoo is the largest British shipping company in China. It has the most influence on the Yangtze River, with a total of 20 steamers upstream and downstream. After the sinking of the Wanliu ship last year, only 19 ships remained. The number of Yangtze River services still accounts for the largest number among the six companies, with ships going up and down almost every day (except Sundays). Last year, the dismissal of tea room employees on the Wusong ship caused a strike by Guangdong sailors, which had a great impact on the Yangtze River shipping industry. Because the company has ships on both the north and south oceans, it has the most cargo transferred to and from various ports in addition to the local cargo. After the strike, the business of Yangtze River steamers plummeted, so it was the first to reduce services and further reduce the freight rates for downstream cargo. The freight rate for cotton fell to three yuan per ton. Even if it is fully loaded, it is not enough to cover the cost, and there is even a shortage of upstream cargo. In the past, the freight revenue of each ship was 10,000 to 20,000 taels, but last year it was only 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. In addition, the Anqing ship had an accident at Qingshanzui, and it has not been pulled out yet. It is said that the sunk Wanliu ship has been sold to Minsheng Company, and the Anqing ship is also planned to be dismantled. The huge business losses throughout the year are probably the highest among the six companies. There are also several upper Yangtze River ships parked empty in Shanghai. Fortunately, when Taikoo Guangdong went on strike, the company's Nanhua shipping industry was very developed and was able to make up for the losses, but it still could not offset the huge losses of the Yangtze River steamers.</p>
<p>(Jardine Matheson)</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson has a total of 22 ships on the Yangtze River, operating upstream and downstream. The sluggish business last year was rare in recent years. In terms of the fuel for all ships alone, the monthly cost is 150,000 to 160,000 yuan, plus ship money repairs, wages, etc., the expenditure has increased without decreasing, and the business income, last year, the average freight revenue per ship for export cargo was only 3,000 yuan for local cargo. Fortunately, there are large shipments of foreign merchants, such as Mobil Oil, British American Tobacco, and other foreign companies' machinery, which can make a slight contribution, but it is still not enough to offset the huge expenditure. At most, six ships on the upper Yangtze River were anchored and suspended in Shanghai. Fortunately, when Taikoo Guangdong went on strike, the company's Nanhua shipping industry was very developed and was able to make up for the losses, but it still could not offset the huge losses of the Yangtze River steamers. (Nissin Kisen Kaisha)</p>
<p>Last year, Nissin Kisen Kaisha barely sent four ships to operate on the Yangtze River, and adopted the principle of indiscriminately lowering freight rates and passenger fares, because all expenses within the company were subsidized by the government. The company has a total of 25 ships, two of which have been sold, and the rest are parked in Shanghai. Recently, it has received a government subsidy of 700,000 yuan. It originally wanted to open a route to Chongqing, but as a result, the people of Sichuan refused to accept the goods and could not proceed. Only one ship was sent to sail on the Hankou-Yichang route. Although four ships were opened on the Yangtze River, the price cuts and disruptions had a great impact on Chinese ships. In this period of poor market conditions, there is no intention to add more ships. (Ning Shao Company)</p>
<p>Last year, the Yangtze River shipping of Ning Shao Company was the worst. In May, the Yongxing ship first ran aground and sank. On November 26, its largest Ningjing ship ran aground again on the Jiongfeng Reef, and had to be dragged out when the water rose in April of this year, with losses of more than 80,000 yuan. Only the old Ning Shao ship was left on the Yangtze River route, and the freight revenue for each trip upstream and downstream was only 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The business suffered huge losses last year. In addition to these six companies, there is also the American Jiejiang Company on the Yangtze River, which specializes in the Sichuan River shipping in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Yichang, and Chongqing. Last year, it was first affected by the war between the two Lius in Sichuan, and then suffered a blow from the invasion of Wanxian by the communist bandits. In addition, the number of postal parcels is increasing day by day, and the Shanghai textile factories are transporting goods to Sichuan for storage and sales. Moreover, Minsheng Company has risen, and most of the Sichuan River small shipping companies have been acquired by it. The number of ships operating now exceeds that of Jiejiang. As a result, Sichuan River has reported excess tonnage, supply exceeding demand, and freight rates have gradually fallen. Although there are eight ships operating now, it is difficult to make a profit. The Sichuan River shipping industry has now become a situation of two major confrontations, with Minsheng and Jiejiang driving side by side. Sanbei and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have no ships operating once winter comes. There are also Xiangtai, Mobil, and Asiatic ships operating on the Yangtze River, but these companies mainly transport their own timber and coal. There are also limited passengers and cargo. The Nissin Kisen Kaisha had a maximum of 11 ships operating on the Yangtze River, between Hankou, Daye, Wuhu, and Japan, ostensibly to transport iron ore from Daye, but in fact they were loaded with inferior goods when they came, and carried miscellaneous grains and rapeseed when they left. After the January 28th Incident, this route of Japanese ships has not yet recovered, and only three ships are currently operating. However, after June of last year, Mitsui &amp; Co. and other Japanese companies in Shanghai had three or four ships regularly traveling on the Yangtze River, also to transport miscellaneous grains from various ports along the river to Japan. At present, there are only ten Japanese ships traveling upstream and downstream on the Yangtze River, between Shanghai, Hankou, Japan, Hankou, and Shayi, which is about one-quarter of the number before the January 28th Incident. According to the survey, there are currently 38 British ships, 12 American ships, 10 Japanese ships, 4 Italian flag ships, and 3 French flag ships operating on the upstream and downstream routes of the Yangtze River. There are more than 30 Chinese merchant ships. In total, there are about 100 Chinese and foreign ships.</p>

The water and electricity projects around the German-Austrian Alumni Association have also been completed. It is planned to add capital next year to expand the water and electricity business in the Chinese-administered areas of Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Zhabei's Water and Electricity Have Been Restored to Their Former Appearance)</p>
<p>Mr. Shen continued, since Zhabei was subjected to the January 28th tragedy, all water and electricity projects were bombed and destroyed without anything remaining. The company, in view of the increasing density of residents in the district, all water and electricity projects should be restored to their former appearance, and actively urged the engineering department to carry out construction. Since the beginning, the construction costs have been huge. As of recently, the restoration project has been fully completed. Even if there are occasional shortages of water and electricity in the residential houses in the district, the company will immediately send craftsmen to repair them after receiving a report, and they can be repaired immediately, so the citizens have no inconvenience.</p>
<h3>A Mother Was Angry That Her Son Was Becoming More and More Depraved, and She Committed Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>Dong Zheng, an old Ningbo woman, 64 years old, lived at No. 3 Hekang Lane, North Zhejiang Road. Her husband was named Xingxian, and she had only one son named Bingxi. He did not engage in proper work and was engaged in licentiousness. Recently, he became more and more depraved. His mother repeatedly admonished him without success, and was extremely angry. At about 5:00 PM yesterday, she committed suicide by swallowing raw opium. She was discovered by someone, who reported it to the police station. Patrolman No. 308 rushed to the scene and sent her to Renji Hospital, but it was too late, and she died shortly after.</p>

They suddenly caught sight of a taxi with the concession permit number 18330 and the municipal permit number 4660. A man was sitting in the car, and there were several large packages, and the man's expression was flustered, which was quite suspicious. They immediately stepped forward to inspect and saw four large bags of heroin, saccharin, and various other medicines, all of which seemed to be raw materials for making red pills.

<h3>Foreigners Also Purchase Yueyuan Printed Editions</h3>
<p>(Secret Editions of Learned Scholars of Past Dynasties Continue to Emerge)</p>
<p>(The Literary and Art Circles of Our Country Suddenly Shine)</p>
<p>(Sinologists from East and West are Ordering by Telegram)</p>
<p>Since Zhang Shouyong, the owner of Yueyuan in Siming, collected secret editions unseen by the world and hand-edited "Siming Congjin," it has brought a sudden burst of brilliance to the literary circles of our country. The first collection of twenty-four kinds, initially printed in 10,000 copies, has sold over 9,530 copies. The academics of the great public figures and erudite scholars of past dynasties in eastern Zhejiang have mostly been kept secret and not made public. Therefore, since this book was reissued, not only domestic literati have wanted to be the first to view it, but also scholars studying Chinese in various countries in the East and West have sent letters to order it. (It is reported that Japanese Sinologists such as Ota, Takefuji, and Matsui have ordered 300 copies.) For the sake of promoting the literature of the former sages, Mr. Zhang has raised funds to continue printing 5,000 copies.

<h3>Construction of County Grain Storage Completed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, in regards to the county's grain storage, previously raised funds, and with the assistance of 10,000 yuan from the Jumi Industry Association, first purchased 2,000 shi of grain. Considering that the county's granaries were still lacking, the Food and Grain Committee purchased six mu of land in the Tangbei Road area and hired workers to build ten granaries and two management rooms. Since construction began in the summer, it has been fully completed. The Food and Grain Committee reported to the county government for acceptance inspection. In addition to dispatching technician Zhu Mingwu to conduct the acceptance inspection, County Magistrate Pan will also transport the grain for storage to complete the work of famine relief.</p>

<h3>Chen Zehua Lectures on "Recent Japan"</h3>
<p>The Baxianqiao YMCA invited Chen Zehua of the Morning Post to lecture on recent Japan at 7:30 PM the night before last. A member of the Bingxun Stenography Agency was dispatched to take notes on the spot. It was roughly stated that since Japan's invasion of Manchuria, it has wanted to implement its ambition of an Asian Monroe Doctrine and its struggle for overseas trade markets, creating an international anti-Japanese front, which has made Japanese diplomacy fall into an isolated situation. Although Foreign Minister Hirota is trying to ease this trend, it will ultimately be in vain if the policy of aggression is not changed. It was also said that after Araki's resignation, his successor, Hayashi Senjuro, is the most formidable soldier in Japan. His coming to power is a sign that Japan is actively preparing for war. The people of our country should use rational eyes to study Japan and correct the weaknesses of our people, quickly strengthen our national strength, and prepare for a war of survival with Japan in the future.</p>

<h3>National Flour Manufacturers Discuss Underwriting American Loaned Wheat Flour Yesterday</h3>
<p>Among the 10 million gold yuan of American wheat loans, the American side requires underwriting 40% of wheat flour and 60% of wheat. The total amount of wheat flour is 6.4 million bags, and wheat is 300,000 tons. The national flour manufacturers believe that it is of great importance, so they sent representative Gu Xinyi to contact the American Cotton and Wheat Affairs Office to discuss the price of American wheat and wheat flour. The two sides could have been close to resolving the outstanding case, but since the collection of import taxes on rice and wheat, the Ministry of Finance has refused to exempt this tax on flour and wheat, resulting in a large difference between the price and the domestic market price. If they underwrite, they will inevitably lose money. Yesterday, the national flour manufacturers held a meeting at the Yiyou Society Club on Sanma Road to discuss solutions. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Manufacturers' Meeting)</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 PM, representatives from thirteen flour mills in this city, including Fuxin, Fufeng, Xinda, and Yongda, including Rong Zongjing and Gu Xinyi, and three representatives from more than twenty manufacturers in the interior, including Chen Jifu, convened an emergency meeting at the Yiyou Society Club on Sanma Road. Gu Xinyi chaired the meeting and reported on the negotiations with Minister Kong, Pack of the American Cotton and Wheat Affairs Office, and Shen Shuyu, the representative of the Customs Department, over the past few days. It was roughly stated that the world market price of American wheat and wheat flour was not so different from the market price of the National Government, but the market price was differentiated after the collection of import taxes. Since the management office did not agree to exempt the tax, the market price was too different, and the underwriting contract was not dared to be signed. It should be decided by the public, etc. After discussion by the public, it was unanimously resolved to reply to the American Cotton and Wheat Management Office, stating the reasons why the contract could not be signed. On the one hand, Gu Xinyi was still asked to represent and explain the difficulties of the national manufacturers to Shen Shuyu, and they must be able to underwrite according to the domestic price before they can obey orders.</p>
<h3>Reply to Pack</h3>
<p>The National Flour Factory Trade Association replied to Manager Pack of the American Loaned Cotton and Wheat Affairs Office in a letter, saying: "In direct reply, we received your letter, and we have listened carefully to the twelve articles of explanation. However, the meaning of the world price is not very clear. After representatives such as Gu approached and inquired, we learned that the world price is compared with the Chinese market price, with a difference of five or six jiao per bag of flour, and a difference of two or three jiao per shi of wheat. Wheat may sometimes be close, but flour has no possibility of being close. The manufacturers have discussed it again and again, believing that the price level is one of the main conditions in the contract. Now that the price is very different, and the number of flour is as high as 6.4 million bags, it is difficult to sign the contract rashly. The facts are difficult, and we should ask for forgiveness. Furthermore, to investigate the reason why world prices cannot be equal to Chinese market prices, we would like to state to your office. According to the current prices of flour and wheat, compared with our country's market prices, it is not too high, but because our country collects import taxes, foreign wheat is taxed about seven jiao per shi, and foreign flour is taxed about six jiao per bag. Therefore, the price of imported flour and wheat is naturally higher than the original price in foreign countries. Now that import taxes have been collected on foreign wheat and foreign flour, in theory, the selling price of domestic flour and wheat in our country should be able to increase proportionally. However, the price of rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains in our country has fallen by two-thirds compared with three or five years ago, while the price of flour and wheat has only fallen by 30-40%. At this time, when the rural economy is bankrupt and the purchasing power of the people is weak, the price of wheat flour is feared to trend further downward. For the present plan, we propose that your office consider the facts and sell the loaned American wheat to manufacturers in successive batches according to domestic market prices. If the loaned American flour can be negotiated with the US government to cancel it, it would be even better. Otherwise, please change it to wheat to solve the difficulties. Whether the humble opinion is feasible, we hope you will make a wise decision. This is addressed to Manager Pack of the American Loaned Cotton and Wheat Affairs Office, signed by the Shanghai Flour Factory Trade Association and the Inland Flour Manufacturers Trade Association."</p>

<h3>The City Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Jianghai Customs</h3>
<p>(Please Allow Inspection and Release of Packaged Sheepskins)</p>
<p>(And Determine a Method for Viewing Samples Without a Signature)</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Jianghai Customs yesterday, saying: "We hereby inform you that on the 25th of this month, according to a report from the Shanghai City Cattle and Sheep Raw Hide Industry Association, the Jianghai Customs forcibly designates the original cargo permit of merchants as a substitute, and does not allow re-packaging for export, resulting in double taxation on the goods and losses to merchants. We request your association to forward a letter to the Jianghai Customs, allowing inspection and use according to regulations to facilitate exports, and also request the customs to inform us of the method of viewing samples of mailed sheepskins so that we can follow the rules. It is stated that member Tang Peiji claimed that the member had shipped 197 pieces of sheepskin from the Chongqing Post Office to Shanghai on December 28th of last year, and another 53 pieces on January 9th of this year, totaling 250 pieces. The sheepskins were entrusted by the member to Qia Taihao and sold to Lih and Yang Company, and deposited in Yih and Yuan Warehouse. Yesterday, Lih and Yang Company presented the original cargo permit to the customs for inspection, as the goods were awaiting re-packaging for export. Unexpectedly, the Jianghai Customs inspector believed that the loose bundles of goods in the package had been viewed as samples without a sample form signed by the Jianghai Customs, and considered them to be non-original goods, and detained the permit and refused to issue it. Yesterday, after the association reasoned, the customs returned the permit, but still refused to allow its use for export, causing the member to have to pay taxes again for export, which is a great loss to the merchant. It has been found that half of the loose bundles were unpacked by the postal inspector stationed at the post office when picking up the goods, and the permit paper was signed, and half was unpacked by the foreign company buying the goods when viewing samples. The reason why there is no sample form signed by the Jianghai Customs is because Yih and Yuan is a warehouse and has no customs room for signing, unlike the wharf warehouse of a shipping company, which has a customs room where customs officials can sign. Now the customs is relying on the lack of a sample form to cancel the original cargo permit. How can the business community accept this? We hereby request your association to forward a letter to the customs, allowing the permit to be inspected and re-packaged for export, and to determine how to view samples of leather goods stored in a warehouse without a customs room where signatures can be obtained, so that members can follow the rules. According to this, Tang Peiji shipped two batches of sheepskin from Chongqing by post and resold them to Lih and Yang Company, using the original permit to report for export. Among them, the loose packages were disassembled by the postal inspector stationed at the post office when picking up the goods, and disassembled by the foreign company when viewing the goods, and the original large packages were stored in the warehouse, resulting in no customs officer signing for the sub-packages. In this real situation, it is not difficult to check and release the goods by comparing the total number reported. Now, instead of doing this, it is hastily withheld, which is actually a plan to impose double taxation on the goods. How can the business community bear this? As for how to view samples of leather goods stored in a warehouse without a customs officer's signature, a concrete method should be determined to order compliance, so as to avoid merchants being blamed for everything. We hereby report the situation and request the customs to promptly forward it to the Tax Department, allowing the loose-packaged sheepskins to be inspected and released, and at the same time, determine a concrete method for how to allow the inspection of goods stored in a warehouse without a customs officer's signature, so that there is a rate to follow, which is extremely important to the public good."</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs' Lianxing Patrol Ship Went to Songhu for Artillery Test Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to increase police force, the Jianghai Customs specially ordered ten patrol ships from the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy. In addition to the first ship, Huaxing, which has been completed and handed over for customs use, the second ship, Lianxing, has also been completed. Yesterday morning at 8:00, it sailed from Gaochang Temple to the Sanyang waters outside the Wusongkou for engine and artillery tests. The chief engineer of the shipyard, Mao Gen, and customs personnel all went to the ship. It returned to Shanghai at 5:00 PM in the afternoon, and the results were very good. It is scheduled to be handed over for customs use next month. The ship has a displacement of 700 tons, a length of 200 feet, a width of 30 feet, a draft of 10 feet, a speed of 13 nautical miles per hour, one 3-pound cannon each at the front and rear, four machine guns, and two escort boats.</p>
<h3>Silverware Industry Outside Workers' Strike Investigated Yesterday</h3>
<p>(The Trade Union Issues a Declaration)</p>
<p>(The Owners Convene a General Meeting)</p>
<p>The silverware outside workers' opposition to the employers' deduction of wages has been brewing a strike for ten days. Previously, the Party and government agencies sent people to mediate, but there was still no result.

It is said that the trade union also has an anal table to participate in.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Plan to Nominate Candidates for the Public Works Bureau Board of Directors</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that Japanese residents in this city are currently discussing the issue of nominating Japanese directors for the Public Works Bureau and the policy of Japanese residents regarding elections. It is expected that after Funatsu returns to Shanghai from Japan at the end of this month, this matter will be resolved in a general meeting. According to the "Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun," Japanese leaders in this city gathered at the consulate at the invitation of the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai on Friday morning to discuss election issues. Although there were rumors that the Japanese planned to nominate three candidates, it was unanimously agreed that only Funatsu and Okamoto would be nominated on that day, because the nature of the administration of the Public Works Bureau first requires close international cooperation. Also, because the general Japanese residents advocate nominating three people, it was decided not to abandon this hope, but to strive to gradually achieve this goal.</p>
<h3>Desperate to Get Rich, Disregarding Interests, Forging Winning Aviation Tickets</h3>
<p>(Already Cheated Sixty Yuan, Still Not Enough)</p>
<p>(Came to Shanghai to Claim the Prize Money and Was Arrested)</p>
<p>Zhang Boqian from Yangzhou recently used two unwinning 088004 series third-period tickets and, with extremely precise surgery, removed the numbers from other waste tickets and pasted them on the numbers of this ticket, making its number become 006204, which happened to be the same as the fifth-prize number. Because his means of shifting the beams and changing the pillars were very clever, even though it was excavated and patched, it was seamless. He took it to the Central Bank to exchange for money. According to the fifth prize, the prize money for the whole ticket is 2,000 yuan, and two tickets should get 400 yuan. The bank did not notice the flaws at first, but according to the practice, it must be checked by the prize ticket office for the watermark seal before it can be issued. Therefore, a receipt was given as proof, and the payment will be made upon receipt after verification. Zhang then took this receipt to the Wanchun New Cigarette Paper Shop on Haining Road, claiming to be named Wang Qingzhi, working in the army. Now, because he won the fifth prize for two tickets, and it still takes time to claim the prize, he cannot wait in Shanghai for a long time, so please replace him with redemption. He is willing to give an 85% commission, and then hand over a receipt from the Central Bank to the cigarette paper shop for receipt. The people in the shop saw that the receipt was indeed valid, and they only needed to do a little labor to get dozens of yuan in profit, and immediately agreed. Zhang then requested to pay 60 yuan first, claiming that he needed money to use, and the shop also granted his request. When the time came for the award ceremony, the cigarette paper shop sent a partner to the Central Bank with a receipt to claim the money. The Central Bank had already verified the two altered tickets through the prize ticket office, and although the numbers did not show traces of alteration, the watermarks were uneven, which was obviously altered. Therefore, the bank detained the Wanchun New Shop partner and sent them to the General Patrol Room along with the two counterfeit tickets. After the patrol head inquired, he learned that he was redeeming on behalf of someone else, and the address of the person he was redeeming for was unknown, making it impossible to investigate. So he waved the shop partner to leave. Ju Zhang Boqian cheated 60 gold, and was still not satisfied. He sent a letter from the Danyang Lianhu Hotel to the cigarette paper shop, urging them to quickly remit the prize money they had received to Danyang, excluding the commission and advance payment. The shop did not reply at first, but Zhang's letters were like snowflakes, and there were words of credibility. The shop then reported to the patrol room, and the patrol head ordered a reply in writing, telling them that it was inconvenient to remit and told them to come and pick it up. Zhang did not know that the matter had been discovered, and thought that he would definitely get a windfall if he went. So he came to Shanghai from Changzhou with Huang Youting, and was arrested. On Saturday morning, the patrol room escorted the two to the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan represented the patrol room, stating the situation and presenting the altered tickets, requesting punishment according to law. Judge Qian then questioned all the witnesses and the two defendants, and ordered them to return to custody, waiting for another hearing on a later date.</p>
<h3>The Beginning of Collaboration Between Chinese and Western Doctors</h3>
<p>The Chinese physician, Mr. Chen Gongquan, is highly skilled in medical principles, especially gynecology. Throughout his life, he has cured many intractable diseases. Based on his experience, there are cases where Western medicine considers there to be no cure, but Chinese medicine can turn the situation from danger to safety, and vice versa. Therefore, he believes that Chinese and Western medical skills each have their strengths and weaknesses and should urgently collaborate, taking each other's strengths to make up for each other's weaknesses, so that medicine can be greatly developed. It is not appropriate to stubbornly adhere to separate schools, which would lead to mutual failure. Recently, the mutual attacks between Chinese and Western doctors have been very intense. In the end, people's hearts lean towards what they specialize in, and they return to practical results. Those who can save lives will naturally win people's trust. There is no possibility of misleading people and still getting their protection. Disputes over words and writing are now very fierce, which is very meaningless. Now, in order to put his long-held advocacy into practice, he has gathered several like-minded people to establish a Sino-Western joint hospital at No. 18 Wen Yuan Fang, Min Ti Ni Yin Road, French Concession of this city. Originally, it was planned to open for consultation on an auspicious day in March, but now, with the approval of all sectors, it is being urged to realize it ahead of schedule, to set an example, in the hope that many will follow. Therefore, preparations have been actively completed, and it is scheduled to start on February 1st, with morning consultations and afternoon as usual. We welcome visits, and we expect a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Silver Furnace Workers Receive Relief Funds from the Guild</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, since the Ministry of Finance ordered the Shanghai silver furnace industry to stop operating and demolish furnaces, the unemployed workers have been registered, assessed, and employed by the Central Mint. However, because the silver refining plant of the Mint has not yet been established, it has been impossible to fully accommodate them. Unemployed workers Jin Jiamao, Chen Guoliang, Yu Yanrong, etc., organized a Silver Furnace Industry Workers Group and petitioned the Municipal Party Department's Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that the assets of the Silver Furnace Guild be sold to provide relief. Now, the labor and management have resolved it through their own negotiations. The management will issue severance pay. It was decided to issue the funds at 2:00 PM today. The unemployed workers' group has declared that it will dissolve its organization immediately.</p>
<h3>Precautions Taken in Front of the Japanese Consulate Yesterday</h3>
<p>The General Consulate at the Waibaidu Bridge took precautions on the night before last to prevent attacks by Korean revolutionaries. Yesterday, it was also for the "January 28th" anniversary. Therefore, the Japanese police chief, Hari, together with the patrol officers of the Public Concession Bureau, took strict precautions. As of last night, everything was peaceful.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of the Poison Manufacturing Plant Cracked on Foch Road</h3>
<p>(Each defendant sentenced to one year imprisonment and a fine of one thousand yuan)</p>
<p>Wang Runhe and Wang Guangqi, Chinese detectives of the Hongkou police station, arrested Jiang Jindao, a Tongzhou native, at around 3:00 AM on the 19th of this month on Rue Haig, and found a small bag of morphine on him. After interrogation, it was learned that it was purchased from a large-scale morphine manufacturing plant at No. 12, Tao Le Village, Lane 456, Foch Road. The detectives rushed to the three-story Western-style house overnight, broke down the door, and successively captured Tang A Jin, a Ningbo worker, and Chen Ji, a maid. They seized a large number of machinery, chemical equipment, and drugs, including raw materials like heroin, white powder, gray powder, and two vehicles, a freight car and a chartered car. It was found that the major shareholder of the plant, Zhang Zhenggao, a Ningbo native, lived at No. 15, Sai Lin Lane, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, and went to arrest him, but he had already fled. His son, Zhang A Gen, and daughter, Chen Zhang (also known as A Qi), were arrested, and two notebooks were seized. Yu A Xian, a shareholder from Ningbo, was subsequently arrested at No. 1, Tongfu Road, and taken to the police station along with the others and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Later, the detectives arrested Cai A Qing, a foreman from Tongzhou, at the entrance of Yin He Li, Pingliang Road, who had escaped from the plant at that time, and jointly sent him to the Third Criminal Court yesterday. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated that it was found that the maid, Chen Ji, was not involved in the manufacturing of morphine, and requested her release. The court approved it. Lawyer Wang also stated that the main offender, Zhang Zhenggao, had a poison manufacturing plant in the French Concession, which was detected by the French police. He had been wanted by the Second Special District Court, but he had fled without a trace for several months. The Foch Road plant was managed by his son, the defendant Zhang A Gen, his daughter Chen Zhang, shareholder Yu A Xian, etc., who often sent drug materials to the plant for use. According to the records, Yu also paid a monthly salary of 40 yuan, which he was still drawing at the end of last month. Chen Zhang's account also showed monthly expenses of 100 yuan, and she was in charge of accounting. It was found that there were still three workers at large, A Si, A Wei, and Sheng Lin, etc. Because there were two copper balls hanging next to the main entrance of the plant, in case of emergency, they would put the balls together, and the electric bell upstairs would ring, so they would know that the detectives were coming and could escape from the drying platform and from the neighboring houses. He then presented the notebooks and other evidence and stated that he was now prosecuting under Article 13 of the Anti-Smoking Law for possessing opium substitutes and Article 6 for manufacturing opium substitutes with intent to sell, and requested severe punishment according to the law. When questioned, the defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao Xiefen sentenced Zhang A Gen, Chen Zhang, and Yu A Xian to one year imprisonment each, with a fine of one thousand yuan each. Tang A Jin and Cai A Qing were each sentenced to six months. The number of days of detention before the verdict was determined to be two days to offset one day of imprisonment. The seized evidence was confiscated according to the list.</p>
<h3>Zhu Rongsheng Pays a Fine After Appeal</h3>
<p>Zhu Rongsheng from Wuxi, nicknamed "Pig Head" Rongsheng, 34 years old, used to be in the meat business, but recently he has been idle. On the evening of May 10th of last year, at 11:00 PM, in a small general club opened by his friend Yan A Da on the upper floor of No. 152, Rue Massenet, French Concession, he was joking with his friend Li Zhen卿 from Yangzhou (37 years old, a salesperson at the𤍠water bottle factory, residing in Jiugengli, Anle Road, Hongkou),</p>
<p>And pushed Li to the ground. Unexpectedly, Li died of asphyxiation. Later, the police reported to the Second Special District Court, which sent personnel to autopsy the body. The result was that he died of heart failure and not from injury. Therefore, the police did not file a public prosecution. Subsequently, Li Wang, the wife of the deceased, refused to accept the result and hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-prosecution against Zhu for causing death by injury, requesting investigation and prosecution, and incidentally filed a civil suit to recover damages of over 10,000 yuan. Zhu also hired a lawyer to defend himself. After the trial was concluded, Zhu was sentenced to four months of imprisonment. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial. Subsequently, Zhu refused to accept the verdict and hired a lawyer to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court held several hearings and deliberations, and finally, on the afternoon of the previous day, overturned the original verdict. Zhu Rongsheng was found guilty of causing death by negligence and was fined 200 yuan. The fine can be converted into imprisonment at the rate of two yuan per day. The defendant was still released on the original bail. Regarding the incidental civil suit, it is reported that Zhu has persuaded people to mediate with the deceased's family and paid a consolation money of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Barber Wounds Debtor with Razor</h3>
<p>Shi Rongshan from Jiangbei, 38 years old, who lives on the upper floor of the overpass in Yi Fengli, Hongqiao Old Street, Hongkou, makes a living by selling cold noodles. His neighbor is a barbershop, and one of the barbers, Mr. Jia, has accumulated a debt of about two yuan for noodles. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Shi went to him to collect the debt. Unexpectedly, a disagreement arose from one sentence, and the barber grabbed a razor and stabbed Shi's face four times, causing blood to flow like a river. He also injured Shi's partner, Huang Benzi, on the head and face. The patrol police were called and arrested the assailant and took him to the police station for questioning. The injured person was transferred to Tongren Hospital for treatment by the police.</p>
<h3>Father-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Withdraw Mutual Lawsuits</h3>
<p>Shen Yunxi, who runs the Shen Fuxing grain and grocery store at the Laiyi Wharf in Shanghai South, only has one son, named Hongjun, who is currently 21 years old and still studying. On April 13th of this year (lunar calendar), he married Miss Qian, the daughter of Qian Zhu, as his daughter-in-law. Later, because Qian Zhu repeatedly called her daughter out to play, Shen Yunxi strongly disapproved, because he thought that women in a merchant's family should not go out often when they have nothing to do. Shen is from an old-fashioned family and was dissatisfied with his daughter-in-law's behavior, so he inevitably gave some advice. Qian Zhu, however, loved her daughter dearly and thought that after her daughter married into the family, she lived at home all the time, no different from living in a prison. Therefore, the two families had completely different views and each held their own opinions. On January 3rd of this year, Miss Qian was taken back by her mother. When she returned home that night, she destroyed the objects in the room. When the maid Xie Li tried to stop her, she was beaten. Afterwards, Shen Yunxi filed a lawsuit with the local court prosecutor's office, alleging injury and damage. After the prosecutor summoned them, he filed a suit with the criminal court. Shen Qian and her mother Qian Zhu also filed a lawsuit with the prosecutor's office, alleging injury. The trial was held in the criminal court the day before yesterday. Judge Guan Liting specially opened the 13th court. The plaintiff, Shen Yunxi, accompanied by his lawyer Hu Yuanteng, appeared in court and stated that he was 46 years old, from Shanghai, living at Laiyi Wharf, and in the rice and wheat business. Shen Qian is my daughter-in-law. (Asked) Why are you suing her? (Answered) On the night of the 3rd of this month, her mother and daughter smashed the objects in the room, such as tables, table lamps, teacups, etc. Because my son advised her not to go out in the cold weather, Qian Zhu said that it is a civilized world now, and she should play and not be imprisoned. So a conflict arose. But my son is still studying and has not earned any money. After her mother and daughter smashed the objects that night, their lawyer was already waiting at the door. Then, I reported them to the police station of the First District and First Precinct, and they were bailed out by the lawyer. (Asked) Are your son and daughter-in-law on good terms? (Answered) Very good. Qian Zhu was ordered to appear in court. She said that she was 62 years old, from Jiading, living at Qinglong Bridge. Her husband, Qian Yunpu, works as an accountant at the Jiu Ji lumber yard. (Asked) Why did you smash the objects in Shen's house? (Answered) I didn't smash them. I was in the countryside. Because I heard that my daughter swallowed a gold ring, I came to Shanghai and stayed at my eldest daughter's house. I took my second daughter back and asked her what happened to swallowing the gold, and I sent her back that night. I was at the door and didn't go in, etc. Shen Qian stated that she was 21 years old, and the rest of her statement was the same as her mother's. She denied destroying the objects. The questioning officer gave a lecture to both sides repeatedly, saying that the young couple had a good relationship, and they should reconcile outside. He also said to Shen Yunxi, "You won't benefit from suing her mother and daughter. You should withdraw the case." He also said to Shen Zhu, "Your husband hasn't earned any money yet. If you go out to play, you will definitely spend money. You should be frugal. Now I advise your father-in-law to withdraw the case, and you should also withdraw the lawsuit from the prosecutor's office. You should make peace. Besides, you are a father-in-law and daughter-in-law, and you should both make concessions to avoid litigation." After the questioning officer spent an hour talking, both sides withdrew their cases. The mutual lawsuits between the two sides came to an end.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, According to the manager of the Hongchang Air Conditioning Company, the person concerned, who came to our office and stated in person, "On January 28th, your newspaper published a news item stating that 1,000 stones of Japanese fish were shipped to Shanghai and sold well, and are currently stored in the company, and have been contacted by fish merchants to sell them all," after reading it, we were extremely surprised. The company not only has no such thing as reported, but also has never stored similar fresh fish items. The news is obviously untrue rumors. For the sake of the company's business reputation, we entrusted you with the duty of requesting the lawyer to declare a correction to the newspaper. Sincerely, please correct it. Sincerely, Telegraph Office, Lawyer Wu Kaisheng, January 28th.</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, Having read your newspaper on January 28, 23rd year, in the Shanghai News section, there is a news item saying that the Dredging Bureau will dredge the Suzhou River. The content is not true. I am not the chief official of the Dredging Bureau to dredge the Suzhou River, and I have never been in contact with the press. I am especially writing to request that your newspaper correct the record and hope that this letter will be disclosed to confirm the facts. Sincerely, Xia Ruifu, January 28, 23rd year.</p>
<p>Dear Editor of Early Newspaper, To Whom It May Concern, Having read your newspaper on January 28th in the News section, there is a section on the case of the abduction by Gao Qingtang, which contains the words "Yang is a pimp of a lower-class brothel," which is inconsistent with the facts and is thought to be an accidental mistake in the interview. This is a very important matter concerning personal reputation, and I hope that it will be corrected. Sincerely, Yang Zhaochun of Baker Road, January 28th. To Whom It May Concern, Today, I read in the Local News section a story about the 130,000 Huge Scam, involving Mr. Xie Pingfeng of our Zhuang. It has been found that Mr. Xie is an employee of our company, not the manager, and our manager is always Xie Peng, who handles all affairs. I am afraid that there will be misunderstandings in the outside world. Please correct the record. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Xie Peng of Dexing Beef Shop, January 28th.</p>

<p>Reading Questions and Answers</p>
<h3>The Fundamental Problems of Studying (Part 2)</h3>
<p>((2) Lack of System in Studying)</p>
<p>After leaving school at the age of twenty (after only one year of middle school), I went out into society to make my way. I encountered some strange things that others didn't, endured some unbearable hardships, and also gained some experiences that others couldn't. In such an environment, I was driven to seek a deep understanding of life. Therefore, I read many books on the history of philosophy, ethics, the history of thought, and so on. On the one hand, I often thought for myself, but I could never organize the scattered fragments of knowledge and experiences I gained from books and personal experience into a coherent system of thought. Sometimes, when I reflected on it in my mind, it seemed to take shape, but when I tried to write it down or express it, it wasn't the same.</p>
<p>Later, after examining myself, I thought it was because my thinking wasn't disciplined, so it lacked order. If I wanted my thinking to be orderly, I needed tools to discipline it. So I thought about studying geometry and logic. However, because I had no guidance, I couldn't break through the door of logic. Gentlemen, think about how painful that is! ... (Letter from Chen Ziyuan)</p>
<p>I am a young man who has not yet graduated from middle school. I left school five years ago to find a way to make a living in society. Since the foundation of my knowledge was not well established, my ability to learn on my own can be imagined.</p>
<p>Since I was a child, I loved reading novels. It seems that a love for "literature" was innate to me. Five years ago, I started reading books on new literature. Later, because I felt that reading only literary books was not enough, I started reading books on "social science." I read an average of more than two hundred pages a day. In half a year, I read dozens of books. However, because I didn't study each book carefully and didn't know "how to study," the results I got were naturally very minimal. Now, I hope that you can give me detailed instructions. The questions are: "How to study literature?" "How to study social science?" (Letter from Zhang Xingfang from Jinan)</p>
<p>... I now want to tell you about my actual life and the difficulties I have encountered, and ask you to give me clear instructions and answers. I work ten hours a day, and I have five or six hours of free time. I don't get any holidays for 360 days a year. I used to study in primary school, reading old books (the Four Books). I haven't read any new literary books. To make a living, I left primary school and went out into society. After that, I experienced the pain and oppression of unemployment, wandering, and being a soldier. Because I don't understand life and don't recognize the chaotic social reality, I want to study social science to understand this current society. I borrowed some books to read, but I can't understand them! I can't understand theoretical books, and books on debate confuse me even more. For example, when I read a book on debate, I can't see at all what is right and what is wrong, and why it is wrong. In a word, I can't understand it. Why can't I understand it? This is because my comprehension is not good, and also because I have not obtained a method of studying. (Letter from Wang Keqiang) According to our speculation, the problems encountered by these people are probably no more than the following three points: (1) leaping forward, and lack of system in studying; (2) not being careful in selecting reading materials and not being able to grasp the correct theory. In a word, it means studying without following the correct path. We have already discussed the impossibility of leaping forward and the importance of the central idea in the articles "Several Issues Regarding the Selection of Subjects" and "The Disparity of Theories and the Grasp of Correct Theories." Readers can refer to them again, so I won't repeat them here. However, from these three kinds of malady, we feel even more the importance of basic knowledge, and the harm of engaging in specialized study before basic knowledge is established. (The conclusion and solutions will be published tomorrow.)</p>

<h3>Full House</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>In a theater, once a famous actor takes the stage, or in a movie theater, when a sensational and alluring film is shown, it goes without saying that before the performance or screening even begins, the place is already packed from top to bottom, with no room to spare, and a "Full House" sign is hung high at the entrance. Similarly, in a large hotel or a ballroom, if it's a Westernized holiday, they won't hesitate to put up a "Full House" sign, leaving latecomers to sigh at the door. As I see it, our great Republic of China resembles a grand Chinese stage, and it's currently facing a "Full House" panic. Speaking of this grand Chinese stage, it used to be quite deserted some time ago. But ever since the Opium War, aha, people realized that the actors in this theater were indeed quite good, so they gradually started arriving to watch. First, they reserved the "five ports" premium seats. Then, they booked the "Hong Kong flower building" and the "Taiwan premium seats." The positions of the "Shanghai," "Hankou," "Tianjin," "Qingdao," and other box seats and main halls were naturally already reserved, and they were also packed to the brim. Three or four years ago, Outer Mongolia, which was only considered an emergency exit, was also occupied. Last year, the last row of seats, which no one ever wanted to sit in, the four northeastern provinces, had people sitting high in them. Last year, even the nine small stools in the corner were being fought over as rare commodities. These don't even count the people peering in through the window holes—Tibet, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guangxi, etc.—trying to sneak in. In fact, there's already a "Full House" sign hanging at the entrance. If more people squeeze in, I'm afraid it will cause a huge mess, making it impossible for the actors to perform on stage. What good would that do?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the grand hotel is also somewhat similar to our esteemed country. The guests in a grand hotel come from all directions, and there are both good and bad among them. Our esteemed country is also a mix of people from all over, with gentlemen from various countries, as well as vagrants, filling it to the brim. If you want to investigate their origins, it's like the guest book of a grand hotel, a complete mess. But then again, a theater or a grand hotel can put up a "Full House" sign to turn people away, but our "grand Chinese stage" and "grand Chinese hotel," even though they have a "Full House" sign, people are still desperately squeezing in. This is really a hopeless situation.</p>
<h3>Strange News About Mr. Lai Distributing Money</h3>
<p>— Wu Miao</p>
<p>According to a Reuter's dispatch from Athens on the 25th of this month, "A wealthy millionaire and industrialist named Mr. Lai suddenly developed a strange eccentricity today. From the top of his residence, he scattered banknotes of 100, 500, and 1,000 drachmas (the Greek currency) downwards, causing passersby to scramble to grab them. This news spread throughout the city in an instant, and tens of thousands of people gathered spontaneously. Mr. Lai also told the police that he deeply loathed and detested this filthy money, and that he was tired of being burdened by it." This is truly an extraordinary story.</p>
<p>In ancient China, there were also people who were tired of money, such as Wang Yifu, who never spoke of money. His wife ordered a maid to surround his bed with money. When Wang Yifu got up in the morning and saw it, he said, "Take away those filthy things." That is one example. Another is a folk tale that says: During the Ming Dynasty, Shen Wanshan, a wealthy man in Suzhou, once flew gold from the top of a pagoda, which the spectators scrambled for as amusement. This is another example. However, one was feigning nobility, and the other was a lavish act by a playboy, while Mr. Lai scattering banknotes from the top of a building, according to the original dispatch, was because he suffered from mental illness. These two are slightly different.</p>
<p>Mr. Lai must indeed be suffering from mental illness. Think about it, where did the thousands and tens of thousands of banknotes come from? The original dispatch said that Mr. Lai is a large industrialist. Since he is a large industrialist, he must own many factories. We can imagine that in the factories, there are tens of thousands of male and female workers who exhaust their blood and flesh to manufacture goods for him, and only then is Mr. Lai's great wealth created. Every banknote in this large amount of wealth is stained with blood. Mr. Lai was indeed so dazed by the blood that he developed a mental illness, wasn't he?</p>
<p>This blood is not only intoxicating Mr. Lai, but it is also corrupting the rich people of the whole world. We see that in the near future, the rich people of the whole world will definitely suffer from mental illness. And now, they are in the beginning stages of suffering from mental illness. Not only is it the beginning, but it is also very deep. Eventually, there will come a day when all the money of all the rich people in the world will be moved to the streets in batches.</p>

<h3>Naive People</h3>
<p>The January 28th Incident, almost everyone thought it was a heartbreaking event, and almost everyone has forgotten it; foreign goods must be good, Chinese goods are all bad, Japanese goods are selling so well that you can't cry but laugh, the January 28th Incident is a thing of the past! Saying that the January 28th Incident is a play is not as good as saying that the January 28th Incident is child's play; because tears have not dried, smiling faces have been seen, Chinese people are very naive!</p>
<h3>An Impartial Discussion of Invincible Broadcasting</h3>
<p>(Copyright)</p>
<p>Since Invincible Broadcasting Studio has advocated Mandarin broadcasting, it has become a fashionable term in the radio industry. Modern men and women almost only listen to Mandarin broadcasting. The grand opening of Invincible Broadcasting Studio on Channel 940 has been reported in major newspapers. However, the wonderful and moving nature of its daily programs is even more difficult to summarize, and it is artistically valuable for review. The first day's program is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Miss Cai Luxi's English instruction is clear and articulate, with correct pronunciation. Starting with phonetics, listeners can learn from the beginning. An excellent textbook for this course is "National English Primer," which is sold by Commercial Press and Family Industrial Society. The songs directed by Li Jinhui, with Bai Hong's "Boat Song" being the most beautiful and graceful, and Hu Jia's "Come Back" being the most poignant. The drum ballad is performed by eleven-year-old girl Fu Peihua, who sings just like Little Black Girl. This child has unlimited potential when she grows up. Yang Lianqin's vocalization is unrestrained, moving the listeners' hearts. When Sun Zuochen is playing the piano, an unnamed amateur suddenly joins in to sing a section from Yang Zongbao (young male role) and an old male role from "Zhulian Village." The voice is mellow and round, much like Chen Xiaodie. The radio station announced that those who guess correctly can go to Family Industrial Society tomorrow to collect a gift. I should get a copy.</p>
<p>Chen Dubei's Guanyin Opera "Dream of the Red Chamber" has reached a transcendent state, and its progress is faster than "Red Flower Vase" and "Little Diamond Drill" cannot be measured in miles. Among them, Jia Rong's flirting with You Erjie is the most wonderful, and the standard Mandarin is truly deserved. In particular, the sound of horses' hooves is the most magical. At first, one horse is walking slowly, then two horses are running side by side, and then several horses are galloping. Without explanation, listeners can understand it clearly. The storyteller has truly been defeated. It is said that Guanyin Opera was jointly invented by Chen Dubei and Chen Xiaodie, and Xiaodie fully supported its success. Therefore, the two Chens have a contract, that is, the newly adapted script of Guanyin Opera will never be published elsewhere before it is broadcast by Invincible Broadcasting. Therefore, if you want to listen to the genuine Guanyin Opera, you can only find it on Invincible Radio.</p>
<p>In short, Li Jinhui's songs, Chen Dubei's Guanyin Opera, and Su Shaoqing's Peking Opera are the three outstanding features of Invincible Broadcasting Studio, which no other radio station can have, or even if they do, they are only in a limited way. In particular, Shaoqing's rich knowledge of opera and phonology cannot be imitated by others. Dr. Mei Lanfang delivered the opening speech, saying that everything Invincible does can reach an invincible level, which is indeed not an exaggeration. The opening ceremony and the first day's program report seemed to be personally recounted by Chen Xiaodie, who was too industrious. On the third day of broadcasting, after the drum ballad, the broadcast suddenly stopped due to machine damage. Invincible Broadcasting is broadcasting from Li Shude Hall. The audience suffered this loss, and Li is really responsible for it. According to reports, Li is the grandson of the prime minister of Hefei and has a great understanding of machine research. His radio station's Channel 940 is indeed very clear, and it can be received in Nanjing and Hankou. However, because the Fuxing Channel is too wide, it is sometimes disturbed, causing mutual damage. It is hoped that the radio station authorities will reorganize as soon as possible.</p>

<p>(Bearing the Pain, Concentrating on Listening to Drum Music)</p>
<p>(Joyful Feelings Haven't Been Sated Before Parting Due to Urgent Summons)</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking about putting aside other people's business, that annoying sound entered his ears again. This time it wasn't military music, nor the sound of "seven ingenious horses," but the sound of a three-stringed instrument and a small drum. Their family was celebrating a happy event, singing a drum ballad. Ji Zhi tossed and turned in bed, barely enduring until two or three o'clock before falling asleep.</p>
<p>The next day when he got up, those sounds were gone. Originally, he wanted to go to the South Courtyard in the morning. On second thought, he couldn't go. His sister-in-law suspected that he was jealous. If he didn't leave today, it would appear that he didn't leave yesterday for a good reason. Thinking this way, he stayed at home for two more days. On the third day, he couldn't bear it any longer, so he packed his luggage, left the house, hired two rickshaws, and headed to the main road to Xizhimen. As soon as he left the gate, he saw a car parked across the road, which was not a common sight on Haidian Street. Puzzled, he couldn't help but look over there. After a while, a large group of people, men and women, emerged. The first was Zhao Ziqiang. Today, he wasn't wearing a military uniform, but a long gown and mandarin jacket, a copper-colored new felt hat with shiny satin trim. He had inserted a red flower on the button of the mandarin jacket in front of his chest. Smiling left and right with a happy face, he was extremely pleased. Gan Zhi thought to himself, "I'm a frustrated person, and I can't bear to see his smug face." So he turned his face, got into the rickshaw, and urged the rickshaw puller to pull quickly. As the rickshaw passed by the car, Guizhi was just getting into the car. Today, she was wearing a pink long cheongsam, and her newly cut and permed hair was formed into a cloud-like pile, with a circle of red silk braid wrapped around her head. A small bow was tied on her left ear. On the right side of her temples, she had a red velvet double happiness flower inserted diagonally. This嬌艷 appearance need not be mentioned. (232)</p>
<p>World Oddities</p>
<h3>Young Female Detective</h3>
<p>The Romanian naval intelligence agency recently discovered a frivolous young naval officer stationed at Constanta Fortress. He was good at socializing, and the officers in the fortress were all very close to him. However, he was very reserved, so it was impossible to tell that he was a woman. One day, he urgently needed to urinate, so a good officer waited outside the toilet. Unexpectedly, an urgent order was given to assemble. The officer waiting outside the toilet hurriedly ran in and was shocked to see that it was a woman. However, because of their close relationship, he was unwilling to reveal the truth. Later, the two gradually developed a relationship, which was detected by people in the agency and reported to the headquarters, and the woman was punished.</p>
<h3>Elephants Also Have Upper Lips</h3>
<p>The French academic community recently revealed an interesting fact: elephants have upper lips. Dr. Fulian of the French Academy of Sciences explained the meaning of the elephant's upper lip: since elephants developed large trunks, they lost their upper lips. However, elephants have upper lips in the mother's womb, like an outline. Later, in the fetus, the upper lip gradually shrank and degenerated as the trunk gradually developed. Therefore, when a baby elephant is born, the trace of the upper lip has already disappeared.</p>
<h3>Suing for Not Having a Son</h3>
<p>A Hungarian man named Xiong Kesi and his wife had only two daughters after being married for more than ten years. Xiong wanted a son very much and often said to his wife, "If you don't have a son, then I will break off the family relationship." His wife thought that what he said was unreasonable, and a conflict arose. Xiong left in resentment, and his wife sued him in the Putai Peterst Federal Court. The judge ruled: "In this era of economic panic, there should not be too many children. Even with the two daughters born, it is already difficult to raise them. Moreover, the birth of boys and girls cannot be blamed solely on women." Xiong refused to accept this and appealed. The chief judge of the highest court first ordered a forensic doctor to examine the sperm and eggs of the couple. The result was that his wife had a slight defect, but he still advised Xiong to rest assured and reconcile.</p>
<h3>Forcibly Kissing is Punished</h3>
<p>An American infantry gunner named Luo Yi was sent to India. One day, he saw a beautiful woman named Nali Xuemeng on the street. He forcibly pulled her to kiss her, but the woman was very unwilling to kiss him. After being forcibly kissed, she sued him in court. However, Luo Yi was originally scheduled to set sail on a ship that day. Because he had to be tried, the warship was delayed for twenty-four hours. The next day, the court sentenced Luo Yi to a fine of seven yuan and warned him not to forcibly pull people to kiss him in the future.</p>
<h3>A New Island is About to Appear</h3>
<p>A small island has been discovered in the sea between Australia, India, and China. According to research and publication by Professor Miershweixi and Dr. Luoshaqi of the University of Rome, the seabed between Australia and Indochina has gradually risen. Because broken rocks have settled and formed islands, this newly emerged island is twice the size of Xieli Island and will soon be able to emerge from the sea. Therefore, the people of our country have come to observe it in person. In the future, an international dispute will inevitably arise over the ownership of this island.</p>
<h3>Single-Handedly Jumping into the Sea to Catch Sharks</h3>
<p>The natives of the Solomon Islands in Australia are the most fond of eating shark meat in the world. Recently, a young man actually captured a shark alive, weighing eight hundred pounds and about twenty-five feet long. The method of capturing it alive was that he jumped into the sea alone, swam quietly to the side of the shark, and when the shark was not paying attention, he used a thick rope to loop around the shark's tail, then immediately swam to the surface of the sea. With the help of fishermen, he actually lifted this shark up alive. This is an unprecedented miracle in the world.</p>
<h3>British Productivity</h3>
<p>Last year, Britain's productivity was the lowest in Europe, and the mortality rate was higher than in previous years. Therefore, the British government is now very anxious about the population problem. A survey by the British Home Office found that the productivity per thousand people was 15.8. The country with the lowest birth rate in Europe was originally France, with 18 per thousand people, Germany was 17.5, Italy was 26, and Britain has now suddenly fallen to the first place in Europe, which has caused concern among the country's authorities.

<h3>Shandong Education Reform</h3>
<p>▲Transform education for seeking officialdom into education for seeking livelihood</p>
<p>▲Extend from rural primary schools to middle schools and universities</p>
<p>▲Ensure that those who receive education can make a living</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondent) In recent years, Shandong education has gradually become stable and has seen gradual development. Director of Education He Siyuan, considering that current domestic schools are disconnected from life, and that children from farming families, once entering school, are unwilling to return to rural work after graduation. Middle school and university graduates consider themselves part of the education community and only want to become officials, becoming consumers. If one province is like this, so is the whole country. This is truly a major crisis for China's future. Therefore, for the past year, he has actively promoted rural education, aiming to integrate student life with learning, in order to correct malpractices. Recently, he has further actively promoted this by expanding the original Mass Education Assistance Committee of the Education Department and reorganizing it into the Rural Education Guidance Committee to promote this effort. Previous letters have provided brief reports. According to further reports, the</p>
<p>(Rural Education Guidance Committee) Committee members include Lai Zhizhong, Chief of the Second Section of the Education Department, Yang Pengfei, Chief of the Third Section, Shao Xiufeng, Director of the Compulsory Education Committee, Dong Shui, Director of the Provincial Mass Education Center, Liang Shuming of the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute, Sun Zeyi, Magistrate of Heze County, an experimental zone for county administration construction, and one representative each from the Construction Department and the Civil Affairs Department. Several experts are also hired to form a joint organization to concentrate the power of many people to complete this great work. After the establishment of the committee, various highest-level agencies are responsible for supervision and guidance. The starting method is, first, to gather graduates of rural teachers' schools and students trained by the Rural Construction Research Institute, and assemble them in Jinan. They will receive short-term training at the Education Department first. After the training is completed, twenty or thirty counties will be selected throughout the province.</p>
<p>(Designated as Experimental Zones) Currently, each county has a central primary school. Select one primary school in the countryside to start experimenting with. The so-called "education for seeking livelihood" uses the trained students as teachers of this primary school, to overthrow the education and teaching methods of textbooks and blackboards. Key points include handicraft promotion, agricultural product improvement, self-government knowledge, and hygiene knowledge. Even after graduation, those who farm can still farm, and those who work can still work, directly connecting them to their inherent lives. After effective results are achieved, other schools will also emulate this. Middle schools and universities will also follow this approach, creating a major transformation in education. Indirect effects include breaking the public's previous impression of education, bringing schools and rural areas together. As education develops, agriculture and industry will also develop. Everyone will have knowledge, and everyone will have the ability to make a living. Taking Shandong as an example, there are three to four thousand higher primary school graduates, three thousand junior high school graduates, and over a thousand senior high school and advanced normal school graduates each year. After graduation, they all feel the hardship of making a living. If this education policy is implemented, it will truly address the most pressing issues of the time. Moreover, implementing this matter</p>
<p>(Does not require huge expenses) Most of the Rural Education Guidance Committee members are unpaid. At most, two people are paid, or there may be some travel expenses, but not much. As for the primary schools in each county, they all use the existing students and existing funds, minimizing expenses. Currently, Liang Shuming, Director of the Rural Construction Research Institute, has come to Jinan and is working with He Siyuan, Director of the Education Department, to concretize the plan. Today (the 24th), He and Liang went together to the Provincial Government to meet with Chairman Han Fuqu to present the matter. Han also greatly agreed. It is heard that it may be submitted to the Provincial Government's political affairs meeting for discussion and approval this Friday, after which it will be implemented.</p>

<h3>Municipal Boy Scout Council Submits a Request to Establish the Boy Scouts of China</h3>
<p>The Municipal Boy Scout Council has been preparing for the establishment of the Boy Scouts of China, the highest guiding organization for Boy Scouts nationwide, for a long time, but it has not been formally established, resulting in the inability of the national Boy Scout cause to make substantial progress. Yesterday, it specially submitted a request to Dai Jitao, the director of the preparatory office, asking him to quickly establish the general association. The original request is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the request, I humbly believe that since our country's Boy Scout cause has been led by our party since the seventeenth year (of the Republic), the organization and training have gradually become unified. However, due to the unsoundness of the central organization, it has been unable to widely extend its talents to self-manage its economy, resulting in its inability to make substantial progress with the changes in political tides and party affairs disputes. Now, the Central Government, mindful of the importance of the Boy Scout cause to the nation and the country, has resolutely announced the general charter, making the purpose of the cause clear. The Boy Scouts of China will also be formally established. The whole country is jubilant. In addition to our joy, the Association, with humble gratitude for the importance of the Boy Scout cause, citing past mistakes, dares to enumerate several points for reference, hoping to be adopted without limit. 1. The General Association system is the core foundation for the central organization of the Boy Scouts in our country. Its future development relies on it. Since the preparation of the Association, two years have passed. Boy Scouts nationwide are deeply fortunate to receive guidance. We hope that the Association will be formally established as soon as possible to meet the expectations of the public, so that training has a standard and organization can be unified. The foundation of Boy Scouts in our country will be further consolidated, and young people across the country will benefit greatly. 2. Since the eighteenth year (of the Republic), the Boy Scout cause in China has repeatedly formed an unstable trend due to changes in the central government. Limited by the system and organization of the commander, it has been unable to widely solicit talents to jointly plan and proceed, and it has been unable to deeply understand the situation and handle it uniformly, causing the top and bottom to be separated, no different from climbing a tree to catch fish, making those engaged in the Boy Scout cause at a loss. Those with weak wills are sometimes taken advantage of by others without knowing it, or even fabricate names and attack others. The despicable means are despised by those who are unemployed by the Boy Scout cause. Moreover, they strongly drag the Boy Scout cause into political activities, polluting the minds and bodies of young people, which is greatly detrimental to the progress of the Boy Scout cause. This is deeply regrettable. 3. The Boy Scout cause has the most noble and purest spirit, and it is one of the school training and social education, to cultivate promising young children and elevate the personality of citizens. Based on our party's educational proposition of taking children as the foundation and the educational methods of modern science, the standard for implementing training is that those who run the Boy Scout cause must be well-versed in organizational principles and have deep experience, otherwise they cannot be competent. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the selection of personnel within the General Association in the future must meet this standard, so that the progress of the cause can be expected. 4. The Boy Scouts of China is the highest management organization of the Boy Scouts in China, and the progress of the cause is based on this. The central organization for its implementation is the National Council. Therefore, in order to establish the General Association, the party must first organize a sound National Council. According to the regulations of the General Charter, the members of the National Council are generated by the Ministry of Education selecting fifteen people who meet one of the qualifications listed in Article 14 to serve. Based on the Association's observations, we recommend several people and humbly request their adoption: 1. Those who sponsor the Boy Scout cause with spirit and material, such as Zhang Qiazhong, Zhu Jiahua, Gu Shusen, etc. 2. Those who are enthusiastic about social undertakings and are highly respected, such as Chen Lifu, Shen Shukui, Tang Changyan, Chen Heqin, Liao Maoru, etc. 3. Those who are directly involved in the Boy Scout cause in China, such as Yan Jialin and Zhang Jiwu, etc. Are the above articles appropriate? We hereby submit this document to the Association for approval and implementation, as it is for the public convenience. Respectfully submitted to Dai, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Boy Scouts of China.</p>
<h3>After Wang Dazao's Arrest, the Principal of Minli Girls' Middle School is Dismissed</h3>
<p>▲The Municipal Education Bureau Sends New School Directors</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, Minli Girls' Middle School on Ximen Wenmiao Road was founded by the school's principal, Wang Subenyan, five years before the founding of the Republic of China. At that time, the public spirit was not yet open, and being able to establish a girls' school, social figures all regarded her as a pioneer in the women's world. Therefore, school affairs developed year by year. Although the principal was a female, she was able to cope with all parties comfortably, which was even more rare. However, time passes quickly, and time does not wait for us. Until a few years ago, the principal's energy declined due to being over sixty years old, and school affairs inevitably had some neglect. Therefore, she appointed her son, Wang Dazao, as the secretary. However, Wang was a left-leaning element. It is heard that initially, the mother and son had quite deep disagreements, but when Wang entered the school, he saw an opportunity to take advantage of, and then organized the Minli Girls' Middle School Drama Club with his consistent strategy of running the Chunqiu Drama Club. Its purpose was completely the same as Chunqiu, and the general young students did not know that they were being used, but only knew that they were being led by teachers and elders, and went to various places to perform. The so-called holding out the limelight ism. Recently, the drama club performed in the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, and their words were reactionary, attracting the attention of the audience. At that time, a certain staff member of the Two-Road Bureau was also present. Under the blue sky and white sun, how could such reactionary elements be allowed to conduct public propaganda? Therefore, he reported to the Two-Road Special Party Headquarters, requesting the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters to investigate strictly. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Party Headquarters sent staff to investigate separately, and found that Wang was indeed the central figure of the Chunqiu Drama Club, and also the host of the Minli Girls' Middle School Drama Club. Wang himself often appeared on the stage to promote vigorously. The Chunqiu Drama Club specializes in performing implicit proletarian consciousness plays. Because the aim is to promote, it accepts invitations from any group, and all performances are voluntary. The intention of the drunkard is not in the wine. However, because the club has to avoid the ears and eyes of the authorities, the club address is not fixed. After receiving the report, the Municipal Party Headquarters thought that although the communist bandits in the front had become exhausted, the elimination of those in the rear could not be relaxed slightly. Therefore, it specially requested the Garrison Headquarters to arrest Wang and interrogate him. After learning about this, the Municipal Education Bureau, considering that the aged and confused principal had tolerated the communist party, in accordance with the regulations for managing private schools, dismissed the principal, Wang Subenyan, from her position and, because the school's board of directors had turned a blind eye to the school's behavior and was nominal, it will send eleven people, including Tong Xingbai and Wu Xingya, as the school's new board of directors before the school starts on the third of next month, to thoroughly reorganize the board of directors.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Football Week</p>
<h3>Special Silver Shield  Chung Wah Eliminated</h3>
<p>(Result: 1-2)</p>
<p>▲ South China Artillery Narrowly Meets Again</p>
<p>▲ 2-0 South China Takes Revenge</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Newsletter) Last week's football (20th and 21st) was the Special Silver Shield Competition. South China had a bye and played the second round of the Group A match against Artillery again. The previous week, South China was defeated 1-2 due to carelessness, and after being criticized, this time the enemies met again on a narrow road, and South China decided to retaliate, and finally won 2-0. As for the Special Silver Shield Competition, Chung Wah was eliminated by the Navy. The situation last week is described as follows:</p>
<p>(Chung Wah Eliminated)</p>
<p>In the past two years, the Chung Wah Association has been listless and sighing for the lack of talent. It has often made up the numbers with players from the B team. It is inevitable to be defeated by the strong Navy. However, it lost by only a difference of 1-2, and its fighting spirit is commendable. There were a total of four Special Silver Shield matches last week. The strangest thing was that the mediocre Hong Kong Club eliminated Lincoln by 2-1, which was really unexpected. St. Joseph's won 3-1 against the Police, and Welsh defeated Kowloon by 2-1, both of which went through a fierce battle. Among them, the battle between Chung Wah and the Navy was the most eye-catching, because one Chinese and one Western, two sides fighting each other, was the most appetizing. The Navy's forwards specialized in advancing, and Chung Wah's rear could not withstand the pressure, so Chung Wah was one goal behind not long after the start. Later, it repeatedly tried to counterattack, but the Navy's defense was extremely strict. Deng Guangsen was monitored and could not move. The Navy took advantage of Chung Wah's empty defense, and the soldiers invaded. Chung Wah was hastily penalized with a penalty kick, and then lost another goal. In the second half, Chung Wah tried to make progress, Zhang Gong sprinted his horse, and fought with the enemy. However, the artistic skills were too high, and the opportunities were repeatedly lost. Until a few minutes before the end of the game, Lu Qiyunxiang got Deng Guangsen's pass and scored a goal. At that time, it was as if a dense cloud wanted to rain, and suddenly a red sun appeared, reflecting back, and the situation suddenly became tense, but the time was over, and Chung Wah finally lost 1-2. Its lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>(South China Takes Revenge)</p>
<p>Ye Pengfei Feng Qingyu</p>
<p>Huang Bing Lu Qiyun</p>
<p>Mai Guoqi He Zuoxian Qu Bingming</p>
<p>Mai Shaohan Qu Jianfeng</p>
<p>Lu Hanchang Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>In the Ordinary Cup Football Match, there was only one South China vs. Artillery make-up match last week. Although the weather was cold and the cold wind was bone-chilling, the number of fans in Hong Kong who watched the match did not decrease slightly. In this match, South China was defeated by the insignificant Artillery team last week due to carelessness, and was severely criticized by fans and the opinion world, which was considered a great shame. Therefore, this time it had the opportunity to meet the Artillery again, and then used all its elite teachers to respond to the enemy, and finally won with two to zero, and there was an improvement in the hope of winning the championship. Looking at the performances of the South China players on that day, Huang Jiliang held the town steadily, and could repeatedly save dangerous balls, which won a lot of applause, and the five forwards were the most effective with Feng Jingxiang, Zheng Jiliang, and Yang Shuiyi, who repeatedly came up with wonderful tricks and rushed into the Artillery's last line of defense, which made the enemy generals tremble. Zheng Jiliang accidentally hit his head on a big rock when saving the ball in the second half, and his teeth were injured, so he reluctantly left the field. As for Tan Jiangbai and Bao Jiaping, they were also able to do their jobs. The mid-rear guards felt slightly weak in their defense, and were often rushed in by the Artillery. Fortunately, the Artillery's right wing was not an outstanding talent, otherwise South China would not be able to win two points so steadily. The reason for the Artillery's defeat was not because of insufficient defense, but because the five forwards were not connected at all. Among the five generals, the right wing was the weakest, losing the most wonderful ball opportunity, I don't know how many. Both of South China's winning goals were scored in the first half, by Tan Jiangbai and Bao Jiaping successively. The record of South China's appearance is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Group A Situation)  Li Guowei Zheng Jiliang</p>
<p>Liu Mao Tan Jiangbai</p>
<p>Huang Jiliang Liang Rongzhao Feng Jingxiang</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Bao Jiaping</p>
<p>Liang Xianzhan Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>South China was unfortunately defeated by Artillery by 1-2 the previous week, and cut off the precious two points. Those who love South China were all worried that the championship might be cut off from this and despaired. In the rematch last week, with a score of 2-0, the shame of the previous failure was wiped out. Compared with South China and Artillery, although it is not said that the strength is very different, South China is more than enough to beat the Artillery. However, in the previous week, it not only failed to win but was defeated. Commentators said that South China was caused by carelessness. Was South China's defeat caused by carelessness? Looking at the battle last week, the carelessness of the place is greatly shown to us. After winning two balls in a row, the generals seemed to be more casual, not as hard as when they had not won. Fortunately, after the Artillery's fierce attack in the second half, they were able to reverse the carelessness of the first half and fought hard, so they were able to maintain the victory of 2-0. After this victory, South China has passed another difficult hurdle, and there is more hope for the championship in the future. Can we win the championship? We must see the later long drive ahead and win every battle. There is indeed hope. Each team's</p>

<h3>The Five Rights of Physicians</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>In the past, Dongchang spoke about medical ethics, and many articles were published in newspapers! Colleagues who agreed and nodded their heads also wrote articles to respond. However, medical ethics are the rules that physicians should abide by and the obligations they should fulfill. There is no such thing as only fulfilling obligations without rights. This time, the National Physicians Conference was heard to be held in the capital. There were more than one texts in the proposals to protect medical rights and improve medical rights, but the scope of medical rights was not clearly defined, which is very regrettable. Medical ethics are the creed that physicians should abide by, and medical rights are the interests that physicians should maintain. The two cannot be missing, so after medical ethics, we talk about medical rights.</p>
<p>(1) The Right to Practice Medicine   The purpose of a physician is to treat illness, and diagnosis cannot be done without practicing medicine. A formal physician, who comes from a formal school and has received considerable academic training, should not need to undergo government examinations or social inspections to practice medicine. His qualifications and knowledge are sufficient to be the basis for his free practice. This is the common situation in most civilized countries. If his background is not formal, then he is in the same category as quacks, close to extortion and acting like fraud. Not only does he not have the right to freely practice medicine, but he must also be banned by the government and society. Therefore, the right to practice medicine is a special right of formal physicians.</p>
<p>(2) The Right to Join a Public Association Among colleagues, there are creeds that should be observed and followed by each other. Only then can medical disputes be eliminated and the progress of the medical profession be expected. The establishment of a public association is to connect the feelings of colleagues, seek the progress of the medical profession, and clearly define its rules as a basis for colleagues to abide by, which is an important condition. Therefore, practicing physicians in a certain area, in order to maintain their personal rights and not infringe upon the rights of others, really need to join a public association, and the public association also needs to order them to join. However, the conditions for joining are limited to formal physicians. Non-formal physicians have no right to practice medicine at all. A group of formal physicians should not have the possibility of joining! Therefore, the right to join a public association is also a special right of formal physicians.</p>
<p>(3) The Right to Receive Consultation Fees   It is unreasonable to work for the public with an empty stomach, so receiving consultation fees is a right that physicians should have. Life is priceless, and physicians spend unlimited energy and bear unlimited responsibility in diagnosis and treatment. Their concern for patients is no less than that of the patient's family. A small consultation fee is only a reward for hard work for the physician, and the patient should not regard it as the price of life. However, some patients often regard it as an honor not to pay consultation fees, or think that after paying consultation fees, they have fulfilled their obligations to the physician. They do not know that consultation fees are something that physicians should have. If they are stingy and do not pay, it is no different from theft. As the ancients said, "Not paying consultation fees is theft," which is a true saying. Therefore, if a patient does not pay consultation fees, a physician can directly demand it, or sue in court</p>
<p>, and the law must severely punish such patients in order to convince people and protect medical care. However, this is only for formal physicians. If it is a non-formal physician, then it is permissible to defraud money in any way. If the patient does not pay consultation fees, it is precisely to punish them. Since they are not physicians, they naturally have no right to demand consultation fees.</p>
<p>(4) The Right to Retain Patients   Physicians bear unlimited responsibility for diagnosing and treating patients, so physicians should regard patients as their own property, and patients should also regard themselves as the property of the physician. The patient's family must not change physicians privately, and colleagues must not seize them privately. The special right of a physician lies in retaining patients. Only in this way can they be responsible and able to do their best in treatment. If the patient's family is fickle, starting with one physician and ending with another, then the physician's responsibility cannot be fulfilled. Therefore, before a patient's family comes for consultation, the physician can solemnly state this point. If the patient's family cannot abide by it, then they may refuse them in advance. And if colleagues intend to seize them, they can also sue the public association. As for non-formal doctors, the patients who seek medical attention from them are due to a temporary misunderstanding. If they realize it and go elsewhere, it is like those who are lost returning from the middle of the road. And the formal doctor's acceptance of this patient is like pointing the way to the lost and helping them reach the other shore, which cannot be equated with seizing the patient of a formal colleague.</p>
<p>(5) The Right to Introduce Medications   Those who sell medicine are merchants, and those who use medicine are physicians. In order to prevent one or two merchants from selling inferior medicines, physicians have the special right to introduce medications. In recent years, foreign medicines have been dumped, and there is no way to resist them. The implementation of this right is an urgent task at present! The physicians in this city have a New Drug Review Committee organization, which is the first step in implementing this right. Medications that have not been reviewed and introduced by this committee are not among the good medicines. Only in this way can the people's lives be protected, and the rights that have been overspent can be recovered, and only medical professionals can handle this right.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that the Constitution has five powers, and the rights of physicians are also five, which are obvious. And these five rights belong only to formal physicians! Basing these five rights as the basis for formulating the Physician Law may also be permitted by the government's legislative authorities.</p>
<h3>Hazards, Removal, and Prevention of Human Intestinal Parasites (3)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Benyi</p>
<p>(Lecture Manuscript for Cihang Midwifery School, Asian Middle School)</p>
<p>((E) Taeniasis)</p>
<p>Tapeworms are the longest and largest of intestinal parasites. They have a length of more than ten to twenty feet. The shape is very different from roundworms, etc. It is a flat and thin worm like a ribbon connected by the head, long neck, and many segments, so it is also called a tapeworm. Each segment of the tapeworm is an independent living body, with both male and female sexes, and can reproduce by itself. Sometimes, the segments in its hind section often fall off by themselves and are discharged together with the feces.</p>
<p>Taeniasis, like other intestinal parasitic diseases, cannot escape gastrointestinal disorders, such as loss of appetite, belching, nausea, and a constant feeling of pressure in the abdomen. These symptoms often become severe after eating scallions, chives, garlic, salted fish, and other things. Conversely, eating milk, eggs, and fatty foods will alleviate the symptoms. When the symptoms are severe, there may also be neurological symptoms such as headache, dizziness, manic attacks, and delirium, and even visual impairment, hearing impairment, severe anemia, severe palpitations, and difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>(F) Fasciolopsiasis</p>
<p>The shape of the Fasciolopsis buski is very different from the above-mentioned types. It is not long and round like a line, nor is it flat and thin like a ribbon, but has a unique form like a piece of ginger, so it is called Fasciolopsis buski.</p>
<p>Fasciolopsis buski has a length of 24 mm to 27 mm and a width of 5.5 mm to 14 mm. It is a local intestinal parasitic disease. It is very popular in several southern provinces of China and the Yangtze River Basin; especially in Shaoxing and Xiaoshan counties of Zhejiang Province. According to a survey, 90% of primary school students in Xiaoshan County have fasciolopsiasis; in other words, in Xiaoshan, 90 out of every 100 primary school students have fasciolopsiasis, which is really a shocking record! The symptoms of fasciolopsiasis are divided into acute and chronic. Acute symptoms include vomiting, bloody diarrhea, abdominal distension, fever, and jaundice. If this worm parasitizes for a long time, the body's development will be greatly hindered, and the development of the gonads will also be much slower than that of healthy people. Therefore, children with this disease are very difficult to develop and are always like dwarfs, which is a unique symptom of this disease.</p>
<h3>(4) Diagnosis, Treatment, and Simple Prevention Methods for Intestinal Parasites</h3>
<p>Since there are so many kinds of intestinal parasites, and the symptoms of intestinal parasitic diseases are so similar and not defined, it is impossible to use clinical symptoms as the goal of diagnosis. It is necessary to examine the feces. To put it plainly, we can diagnose a certain intestinal parasitic disease only when we find a certain type of intestinal parasitic egg, or a certain type of intestinal parasite, or a certain type of intestinal parasite segment in the feces. The examination of feces is very complicated and is not within the scope of what I am talking about today, so there is no need to write about it here. The treatment of intestinal parasitic diseases either only requires taking some medicine without staying in the hospital, like ginger worm disease; or requires both taking medicine and enemas, like pinworm disease; or requires hospitalization to be easily treated, like duodenal disease. In short, these are all the responsibility of the physician. If you have a disease, don't listen to the physician's guidance, so there is no need to write more. The prevention of intestinal parasitic diseases must be done jointly by the country and the people to be effective. Therefore, in China, where health administration is not developed, many things cannot be done. Rather than hoping too high and not being able to achieve it, it is better to work down-to-earth. Therefore, what is written here is just a few simple prevention methods that everyone can do. Before talking about the prevention methods of intestinal parasitic diseases, we must first talk about the transmission routes of intestinal parasites. If the routes are clear, prevention will naturally be easy to start. For example, to catch a robber, you must first find out the robber's appearance and the robber's lair; otherwise, running around the street like a madman, how can you catch a robber? Then, how can you start preventing it without knowing the transmission routes of intestinal parasites? (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Listening to President Wang's Speech</h3>
<p>— Female Physician Chen Baoqin</p>
<p>On the second day after the opening of the Third National Physicians' Representative Assembly, President Wang hosted representatives from various regions at the Iron Department Auditorium. President Wang delivered an impromptu speech, elaborating on the meanings of "new" and "old" medicine in great detail. He also pointed out the crux of the problem in the thinking of the Chinese people, with every sentence hitting the mark. Although he said modestly that he was a layman in medicine, such a clear-headed layman who could distinguish right from wrong was actually of great benefit to the insiders.</p>
<p>His speech has already been published in various newspapers, and many Chinese people have benefited greatly from reading it. There's no need for me to repeat its content. Because President Wang is not a medical expert, he can only see the vagueness of the Chinese people's understanding of new medicine, but he did not elaborate on the reasons for this vagueness. He said, "...We feel that the Chinese people are more advanced and have a clearer judgment regarding tools for killing people; however, they are very vague about tools for saving lives and tend to be indecisive..." He only cited many facts to prove his observation. But if someone asked, "The Chinese people see the advancement of tools for killing people so clearly, why can't they see the advancement of tools for saving lives?" Perhaps President Wang was unable to fully answer this question due to time constraints. We would now like to add a few words to this question:</p>
<p>The reasons for the Chinese people's vagueness regarding medical advancements: First, it is still due to intellectual immaturity. They only have direct perceptions and lack theoretical deduction. They can only see that killing with knives and spears requires getting close to the target, and the killer must also take care of themselves, which is very dangerous. It is far inferior to new-style guns and cannons, which can take lives from afar. Moreover, one cannon shot can kill hundreds or thousands of people, which is incomparable to clumsy knives, spears, bows, and arrows. Therefore, even a five-year-old child can clearly judge the killing effectiveness of old-fashioned Chinese knives, spears, bows, and arrows versus foreign new-style airplanes and cannons. Even though the Chinese people's knowledge is immature, does anyone not know that a cat cannot defeat a tiger?</p>
<p>Medical theories and facts are not so simple. Scientific medicine can only prevent people from dying unjustly, but it cannot make people immortal. In other words, even new medicine does not have a method for eternal life, allowing everyone to live permanently in the world. Therefore, there are incurable diseases. Conversely, the human body has natural resistance, so there are also diseases that heal without treatment. Moreover, there are diseases that could have healed on their own, but are instead made incurable by the destruction of poor medical treatment. Or, a disease may be cured by one doctor but worsened by another, or worsened by one doctor but cured by another, or seemingly worsened by one doctor, but this is actually the inherent trend of the disease. For example, in the early stages of typhoid fever, a disease may seem to be cured by one doctor but is not actually cured. For example, many diseases can have their fever reduced and pain temporarily stopped with only symptomatic treatment. All these complex phenomena, as well as the reasons for cure and harm, are by no means something that ordinary people can understand or judge. Therefore, although new medicine has made significant progress, it is not as obvious and easily seen as weapons. Now, let's cite another example to make it even clearer. We often hear some gentlemen who call themselves new people say, "Western medicine's surgery is good. Look how quickly it treats sores and injuries! I'm afraid internal medicine is not as good as traditional Chinese medicine, right?" They are also making direct observations, only seeing the external aspects of new medicine that can be seen. They know what it is, but not why it is. It is just like the old villagers praising the foreigners' airplanes and cannons. How would they know the true essence of airplanes and cannons, or where they came from? This kind of science is invisible and intangible, and can be regarded as a true spiritual civilization, which is absolutely incomparable to the unprogressive revivalist spiritual civilization advocated by the generally ignorant Chinese people.</p>
<p>Second, some new doctors are not convincing. The Chinese people's distrust of new medicine is certainly due to the intellectual immaturity of the masses, who cannot distinguish between the foolish and the wise. However, the fact that some new doctors are not convincing is also undeniable. Currently, many doctors who practice medicine privately or hold medical positions in public and private hospitals have not received rigorous training in academic theory and skills. Whenever a disease arises, they do not know how to diagnose it, so the medicines they use are naturally ineffective. Others are paid a fixed monthly salary, so they believe that the number of patients and the results of treatment have nothing to do with their own interests or reputation. They do not examine patients in detail, so they deal with them perfunctorily to avoid being bothered by patients and not having time to attend to them. What is even worse is that they are arrogant and self-important like the pigs of Liaodong. Who is worthy to talk to them if they are not their peers? They do not even glance at poor patients. Therefore, patients often have not finished stating their complaints when the prescription is already written. How can such carelessness inspire faith? Those who like to stir up trouble often criticize each other. A few days ago, the newspapers said, "Even a leading Chinese hospital is so negligent towards patients," and this was caused by these people. Furthermore, there are also some ignorant and unskilled people who falsely claim to be doctors, giving injections and prescribing medicine, deceiving people for money, and causing harm to others, which is no small matter. However, these are all human problems, not academic problems. If the government is determined to rectify the situation, wouldn't it be possible to use severe laws to crack down on them? Recently, I heard an interesting piece of news. A certain agency planned to establish several village clinics, but to save money, they did not want to hire additional doctors. They simply gave the elementary school teachers in each village a little training to serve as doctors. This is simply treating elementary school teachers as all-knowing and all-powerful, and at the same time, it is treating medicine as too simple and easy. If this is how things are done, the future of Chinese medicine is truly unimaginable, and this is also a clear demonstration of the Chinese people's lack of understanding of new medicine.</p>
<p>Third, it is due to the counter-propaganda of old doctors. Although new medicine is still in its infancy in China, many intellectuals who understand the true essence of science are unwilling to entrust their precious lives to incomprehensible traditional Chinese medicine, thus causing a kind of occupational problem and counter-propaganda. There are even a few prominent and powerful figures who, without examining right and wrong and without understanding the true essence, rise up to echo them, acting like foxes borrowing the power of tigers, further confusing the ignorant. Therefore, mysterious traditional Chinese medicine is still rampant today. If it is said that traditional Chinese medicine is a national treasure and should not be abolished, then why do people abandon knives, spears, bows, and arrows without running around and crying loudly, talking about the demise of a national treasure? As for traditional Chinese medicine, it should be extracted, analyzed, and tested to be used in the treatment of new medicine. This kind of work can only be done with applied science. Or can it be done by gentlemen who talk about yin-yang, the five elements, and the six qi? Therefore, those who advocate for traditional Chinese and Western medicine to join hands, taking the strengths of Western medicine to compensate for the deficiencies of traditional Chinese medicine, simply do not understand science. Since our people are so ignorant and numb, how can we, who bear the important responsibility of medicine, bear not to do our best to awaken them from their delusions, rescue them from the traps of metaphysics, and free them from the bonds of the god of death? Fortunately, Mr. Yu Yunxiu, who has been striving for medical revolution, has already overthrown the base of traditional Chinese medicine. Twenty years after the publication of his book, no one has been able to make a comparable argument. The Chinese people should have understood this. It is a pity that the Chinese people are truly numb, completely losing their rational instinct, simply incurable. Therefore, Mr. Yu still laments that his revolution has not yet succeeded. (See "On Medical Revolution," Volume 2, page 59) Revolution is originally not an easy task. All reforms have a kind of resistance. Although in theory the old is overthrown, in reality it is difficult to completely improve it. Moreover, Mr. Yu only has the theory of revolution, but no revolutionary tools. That is, his books are not commonly seen in ordinary bookstores, and the words in his first volume, although not very profound, are also not something that ordinary people can understand. This can be said to be a lack of publicity. If publicity is not in place, the revolution will not be easy to succeed. Could it be said that Mr. Sun Yat-sen wrote a book of the Three Principles of the People in the style of ancient prose and hid it at home, and he could overthrow the warlords? Speaking of publicity, we cannot but blame our country's journalists. In the past, most of our country's journalists did not believe that new medicine was an advancement, so they often refused to publish articles refuting traditional Chinese medicine. On the contrary, they often published many counter-propaganda works to cater to people's preferences. Therefore, Mr. Yu, as a doctor and not an important figure in the party-state, had little influence and his words carried little weight. Although what he said was so reasonable, few people paid attention to him. Therefore, in the past few years, no matter how hard he shouted, except for some people in the medical community who deeply sympathized with him, few people in society paid attention to him. Although now, newspapers understand a little more and society pays a little more attention, the unreasonable metaphysical defense line has deepened even further. From this, I often feel that the actions of great people and gentlemen are always valued and imitated by ordinary people. In the future, I hope that the important figures of the party-state will often take the time to publish one or two articles promoting scientific arguments, or texts. It doesn't matter if they are well-written or not, it will definitely arouse the attention of people in the society. As long as someone pays attention, there will be a way, and it can invisibly save the unjustly dead souls every year. Therefore, President Wang's speech, after being published in various newspapers, has truly benefited the Chinese nation not a little.</p>
<h3>New Interpretation of Old Medicine: Attacks and Errors</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Mr. Chen Cunren's Arguments on the Attacks and Errors of Sunbathing for Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>I have long read Mr. Chen's "A General Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis." I know that you hold the great ambition of reinterpreting old medicine and newly applying old remedies. This is commendable. However, for old medicine to be able to abandon the metaphysical theories of the five elements, six qi, yin-yang, and mutual generation and overcoming, and to draw upon verified facts, tending towards science, is indeed a good phenomenon in the transitional period between old and new. However, those who discuss new medicine should have a foundation in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Only then can they avoid errors in citing articles and make themselves a laughingstock. If one pretends to know what one does not know, shows off intelligence, and lightly interferes with established opinions, not only is there a suspicion of Zheng music disrupting the harmony, but also self-damage to one's value, which is quite pointless. As for whether old medicines can be newly applied, this is what we have hoped for day and night and cannot forget for a moment. However, this kind of work should clearly recognize, realistically test, and scientifically verify it so that the foundation is solid and not swayed by slight winds. If, under the guise of scientific medical theory, one still adheres to unscientific medicines, it cannot but make people feel inconsistent. For the past twenty years, I have dabbled in pulmonary tuberculosis. I deeply wish to use my humble opinions to lead Mr. Chen as a comrade, to cut and polish them. Mr. Chen, will you allow me?</p>
<p>Regarding the benefits of sunlight to the human body and its ability to treat diseases, our country recognized it very early on, not waiting for its transmission from the West. For example, the "Su Wen: Great Treatise on Adjusting the Spirit with the Four Qi" says that the weather is clear and bright. The virtue is not stored and does not descend. Also, the "Treatise on the Connection of Vital Energy to Heaven" says that at dawn, human energy is born. At midday, yang energy is abundant. At sunset, yang energy is weak and the energy gates close. The biography of Jin Wang Dao states, "If there is no sun below, how can all living things be illuminated?" Zhang Hua's poem "Journey to the West" also has the line, "Pottery with benevolence, illuminated by the light of heaven." All recognize the light of the sun and sky as the source upon which we rely for nurturing. Moreover, the application of red light to smallpox and measles is a form of light therapy that has always been popularly known in our country. However, the application of sunlight to pulmonary tuberculosis is not seen in old books and classics, which indicates that it is a modern academic subject. Now, if we want to discuss sunlight treatment for the lungs, we must briefly describe the analysis of sunlight and the inherent functions of light rays, which those who have not studied physics cannot believe. Although sunlight is clear and bright, shining universally, it is actually not white, but a mixture of light rays of various colors. Try using a spectroscope to analyze it and you can distinguish the seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. After a rain shower, a rainbow appears in the sky. This is the phenomenon of light refraction by water vapor into our eyes. These are the rays that we can see. In addition, there are two rays that the human eye cannot see, called infrared rays and ultraviolet rays. Together, they make up nine types of light rays. Although the "Shangshu Kaolingyao" originally had the sentence, "The sun has nine lights, illuminating the four poles," the words are the same, but the meaning is actually different. All light rays differ due to the size of the refractive index and the length of the light wave. Therefore, among the nine types of light rays, those with a large refractive index and short light waves are ultraviolet, violet, blue, and cyan rays, which are bacterial and chemical rays. Those with a small refractive index and long light waves are infrared and red rays, which are warm rays. Since the sun emits various rays together, the sunlight we receive has a mixed effect, which is what the biological world relies on for life and growth. Superficial people think that under the clear sky, everything is universally the same. However, they do not know that the source of sunlight comes from the sun. It passes through thousands of miles of the sky, in the stratosphere, far from the ground. The air is thin and the temperature is average. It is still unknown whether there are other substances in this vast space. However, according to recent reports from high-altitude explorers, the Earth is surrounded by air about fifty miles above the ground. This fifty-mile-thick air can be divided into two major layers. The air from the ground to eleven miles above is called the troposphere. In the North and South Poles, the height above the ground in this layer is only about six miles. The air in the troposphere is constantly flowing up and down due to the influence of different ground temperatures, causing various meteorological changes such as wind, clouds, rain, and snow. The farther away from the ground, the colder the air and the less the ability to convect, so the various phenomena of wind, clouds, rain, snow, and fog gradually become scarce. If it is more than eleven miles high, the air is thin and cold, and hardly flows, so it is called the stratosphere. Whether the sunlight that passes through the stratosphere is different from the light emitted by the light source is still lacking in experimental reports. The air in the troposphere has both cold and warm temperatures, so it has both thick and thin densities. Moreover, the layer closer to the ground is often mixed with physical and chemical changes caused by living and non-living things, which is very complicated. Therefore, the sunlight that passes through this layer and reaches the ground does not contain consistent light rays. Not only is there a difference in the amount, but some of them even disappear completely, with infrared and ultraviolet rays being particularly affected. According to the experimental reports of E. Daunmeyer and A. Puttenauer of Germany, in urban areas such as Berlin and Hamburg, ultraviolet rays in sunlight can only reach the ground between May and August each year. At other times, it is a period of darkness for ultraviolet light. From this, we know that the sunlight passing through the troposphere is not only significantly different between high and low altitudes, but also varies at the same location on the ground due to various complex relationships.</p>
<h3>Applying Traditional Chinese Medicine in a Western Way (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>▲ (19) Gentian (Gentiana)</p>
<p>(Origin)</p>
<p>This product is the dried rhizome and root of the Gentianaceae plant Gentiana scabra Bunge. The original plant is a wild perennial herb. The stem is erect. The leaves resemble bamboo leaves. They are opposite and have no petioles. In October, three to five blue-cyan fused-petal flowers bloom at the top of the stem and in the upper leaf axils. They expand during the day and close at night.</p>
<p>(Characteristics) The rhizome of this product is up to one dm. long. The diameter is about five mm. It is now dark gray-brown. There are irregular ring patterns. The upper end has stem scars or the remains of stems. Numerous roots grow on the bottom and sides. They are about two dm. long and about three mm. in diameter. They are now light brownish-yellow. There are longitudinal wrinkles. The texture is soft and flexible. However, when dried, it is easy to break. It has a special odor. The taste is extremely bitter.</p>
<p>(Composition) The bitter taste of this product is due to the crystalline bitter glycoside gentiopiprin (C16H20O9). It is contained in fresh roots. In dried roots, more than half of it is decomposed by the action of enzymes. Its crystals decompose into non-bitter Gentiogenin and glucose when heated with dilute acids. It also contains four percent of the trisaccharide gentianose.</p>
<p>(Tests) The powder of this product is sometimes adulterated with ocher and guaiac wood powder. In addition to microscopic examination, the ash content can also be quantitatively determined. If there are more than six percent of residue, it means that unclean roots and forgeries are mixed in.</p>
<p>(Efficacy) This product is a bitter stomachic. It is often used with other medicines. The dosage is 0.5 to 2 gm at a time.</p>
<p>(Appendix on Old Theories) It is very bitter and very cold. It descends in a sinking and yin manner. It benefits the liver and gallbladder and drains fire. It also enters the bladder and kidney meridians. It removes dampness from the lower jiao. It has the same effect as fangji. (Note) Recently, gentian root and gentiana root are often regarded as the same thing. In fact, gentian root is the root of Gentiana scabra Bunge. Gentiana root is collected from the roots and rhizomes of various plants such as Gentiana lutea L, Gentiana pannonica Scop, Gentiana purpurea I., and Gentiana punctata I. Although their effects are the same, gentian can replace gentiana, but the plants are actually different. In the current Chinese Pharmacopoeia, the English Latin name of gentian actually uses the word Gentiana. I don't know if it is different from the gentiana in the British and American Pharmacopoeias. There should be explanation and correction.</p>

<h3>"The Way of Heaven"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hui</p>
<p>For many years, the ethics that have ruled China have all come from Confucian books. Buddhist thought goes to extremes and is not the "middle way," so although Buddhists live in this world and obey all kings, princes, and ministers, they leave human affairs and occupy places with the most beautiful mountains and rivers, considering themselves to be free and unfettered "outside the world." Taoists are more compromising. Their original philosophical foundations are not clear. Although the philosophy of Huang-Lao is profound, it is not the religion revered by Taoists. It becomes increasingly low-level, and later, they use some tricks of burning alchemy and refining mercury, appearing and disappearing among the high officials. These schools of ethics surround the minds of the people so that no water can leak through. Spreading a network of heaven and earth, whenever a slightly strange or outstanding idea is produced, they completely swallow it up, like a spider swallowing a dragonfly or fly.</p>
<p>However, whether one leaves the world or enters it, life cannot be discarded. Since there is life, there must be struggle. Since there is struggle, it must end in killing. Therefore, many ways of leaving the world are actually the doors to entering the world. Those who promote the "gospel" are certainly saving people on one hand, but for the most part, they are saving themselves.</p>
<p>Thus, all ideal paper crowns are destroyed, revealing the original true form of life. At this time, the three religions, and even the five religions, have the same source, coming to a unified harmony｜｜called "the Way of Heaven."</p>
<p>"The Way of Heaven" has ruled Chinese society for five thousand years. It encompasses everything and permeates everything. Confucius knew it but did not say it. Smart people do it but do not speak of it. The vast and fair is "the Way of Heaven." Killing people like grass without a sound is also "the Way of Heaven." Those who are officials are practicing "the Way of Heaven." Those who are robbers are also "walking the Way of Heaven on behalf of heaven." Reading the actions of the heroes of Liangshan Marsh in "Water Margin," watching them swing their broadswords or spears, killing so that flowers fall and water flows, one may not think that they are killing people. It is thought that they are "walking the Way of Heaven on behalf of heaven"!</p>
<p>It is an excuse for all evils and a barbaric explanation. The Way of Heaven is divided into yin and yang, but not into good and evil. To them, both good and evil are good, just as there must be night and day. This is the division of yin and yang. And what is heaven? The beauty is that "Heaven says nothing!" It is precisely｜｜themselves.</p>
<p>Looking back at history, this set of tricks has been used for five thousand years. Human lives grow like weeds, and also wither like weeds. If Chinese civilization does not overthrow this barbaric "Way of Heaven" and re-establish a new "way of the world," then the days of its demise are not far off!</p>
<h3>Entered the Kingdom of Heaven</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because my clothes were a little too dirty, the men and women in front of the church who were soliciting people to listen to the Bible did not drag me in, but I insisted on going in, walking in leisurely. However, I was not going to accept the gospel, nor was I going to beg for grace. I just wanted to sit quietly for a while in the warm house, leaning against the long chair with a backrest. Because several nights of sleeping on the streets had made me feel slightly ill. That was in Kunming, far from my hometown, on an evening when the autumn wind and white dew were coming.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever been able to sit in a brightly lit, warm house when they were wandering and helpless on a desolate street late at night? Only they can appreciate my happiness at that time. After I nestled myself next to an old man, I felt like I was in the clouds and mist, as if I had entered the kingdom of heaven, and it seemed that the world that had been hostile to me had suddenly become better.</p>
<p>"...God treats all people equally..."</p>
<p>A pastor in his thirties was speaking loudly on the podium. These words seemed to be comforting, but I had no intention of listening carefully. I just turned my head back and forth, looking around curiously. Not far from me, leaning against the wall, stood a young man who looked like an employee, staring at me sternly with cold and calm eyes. I understood that he was watching me, guarding against me. Perhaps because my clothes, my hair, and my face were all indicating that I had other intentions for coming here. I ignored him and just sat there properly, pretending to be listening as sincerely as I could.</p>
<p>The man left the podium, and another woman took his place. Her voice and demeanor immediately moved everyone, although the words she said and the gospel she preached were still the same. I secretly glanced at the one who was watching me, and his gaze had gradually changed direction, shooting towards the female missionary. The woman was indeed speaking very movingly. When she talked about God's compassion for the poor, she raised her thin eyebrows into an eight-character shape, placed her hand on her full chest, and made a sympathetic sighing sound. It made people feel as if, if there really was such a female God in the world, then people would probably become more well-behaved and obedient.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I could see her watery black eyes quickly cast a gentle glance at my side. This youth who looked like an employee was simply stunned. The saliva that welled up at the corner of his mouth also stretched and trailed down in the form of round dewdrops. If Christ suddenly saw that a believer was listening to his remaining gospel with such sincerity, he would surely be very happy. Another youth who looked like an employee came over, nudged him with his elbow, and pointed his mouth towards me, meaning, of course, to call him to pay attention to his duty of surveillance, while also making mocking, low-pitched laughter. His face immediately turned red, his veins bulged, and he was embarrassed. And I unknowingly wanted to laugh. He immediately fixed his angry gaze on my face, and then walked up to me and said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Please leave!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>I asked coldly.</p>
<p>"Why? ... You have to leave, that's all."</p>
<p>He was simply trembling with anger. Although his voice was still low, it was as if it was ground out from between his teeth. Listening to the woman's clear and charming voice, saying again that the poor and suffering are the most loved by God, I was pushed out the door and walked onto the street swept by the autumn wind.</p>
<h3>Who is a "Shanghai School" Writer?</h3>
<p>— Qing Nong</p>
<p>Old operas have distinctions between the "Beijing School" and the "Shanghai School." Those who discuss old operas always value the "Beijing School" and belittle the "Shanghai School." Mr. Shen Congwen, in his speeches published in the North, criticized the "Shanghai School" of the Chinese literary scene. This naturally also meant respecting the "Beijing School" and looking down upon the "Shanghai School." Mr. Xu Maoyong raised an objection, arguing that if there truly is a distinction between the "Beijing School" and the "Shanghai School," the characteristic of the "Shanghai School" is only "commercial competition," while "the talent and temperament of the literati" should belong to the "Beijing School." This argument also makes a lot of sense. However, I believe that the "Shanghai School" does indeed exist, and this group of Shanghai School writers, due to the characteristic of "commercial competition," have already sold their character and their manuscripts together. There is no need to blame the contempt of the "Beijing School" writers. Everyone knows what's in their hearts, so there's no need to talk too much. If you think that you are selling articles in Shanghai, and people scold you as a bald donkey, and you think that you are also a monk and get angry and argue, that is completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>Who is a "Shanghai School" writer? Let me expose the trickery today:</p>
<p>Someone who steals the works of established writers and publishes them under their own name is a "Shanghai School" writer. Someone who claims to borrow a friend's excellent work and publishes it under their own name to gain fame is a "Shanghai School" writer. Someone who is already famous and uses their own "brand" to publish the works of unestablished writers to cheat people out of money is a "Shanghai School" writer. Someone who translates articles from foreign magazines or entire books without indicating that they are translations is a "Shanghai School" writer. Someone who buys translation works at low prices and uses their own "brand" to seek both fame and fortune is a "Shanghai School" writer. ...</p>
<p>This group of "Shanghai School" writers includes both old and young. The "first to make figurines for burials" are certainly shameful, but those who "follow their example" are also shameful. The facts are clear and undeniable. The non-"Shanghai School" writers in Shanghai should stand up and clarify themselves. There is no need to trouble the "Beijing School" writers to make a long expedition.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Like This</h3>
<p>— Wei Li</p>
<p>××:</p>
<p>My friend, you haven't been to Guangzhou. Maybe you, like I was a few months ago, think that Guangzhou is the most modern city in southern China?</p>
<p>What we call modern, wouldn't you say, refers not only to material construction but also to "culture"? Indeed, the rows of docks along the Pearl River, the newly built asphalt roads, the skyscrapers, the large department stores, the trains, the cars... This is indeed the Guangzhou I imagined. However, in terms of "culture," I feel infinitely disappointed. Before coming here, I thought that Guangzhou's atmosphere must be much more open than that of the inland, because this place has been trading with foreigners the longest, and it is also the birthplace of the National Revolution. But after coming here, it's not like that at all.</p>
<p>Leaving aside everything else, just in terms of education level, Guangzhou is probably several years behind the "North." This is what many Cantonese friends have told me. Based on my personal experience, they are not just being polite. Indeed, high school graduates here are at most equivalent to first-year high school students in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and other places. There are even many university students whose level is not as good as that of first-year high school students in other places! Although National Sun Yat-sen University is now following in the "footsteps" of other national universities, urging the Ministry of Education every day to remit money to complete the new campus, it is still far from being the so-called "highest institution of learning in the Southwest." As for the daily life of Guangzhou people, it is even further from what I imagined. "Eating in Guangzhou" is why tea houses and restaurants are everywhere. Not only do wealthy patrons often come to these places, but even rickshaw pullers always come to drink a few bowls of tea after finishing their work every day. The second thing is the prevalence of gambling. No matter which street you move to, you will always hear the sound of mahjong next door. Some people spend their lives sitting at gambling tables day and night. Small shops selling "get rich tickets" are everywhere on the streets. Large signs advertising prizes of tens of thousands of yuan are waving in front of you. Guangzhou has finally made some progress recently. You don't see many "fortune-telling stalls" on the streets anymore. But if you cross the Haizhu Bridge to Henan, it's another world! Next, let's talk about opium. Opium is an open secret. There are always several "high-class smoking cessation rooms" in every alley. I heard that in Henan, they are called "conversation places."</p>
<p>What disappoints me the most is the superstition of Guangzhou people. Because of superstition, they like to set off firecrackers no matter what happens. They set off firecrackers to worship gods on the first and fifteenth of the lunar month; they set off firecrackers when someone gets married; they set off firecrackers along the way to welcome the walking team from Hong Kong; they set off firecrackers in front of the bank when a lottery ticket wins. On the day of our university's opening ceremony, after government officials finished speaking, everyone went to the playground to take pictures, and firecrackers were set off at the school gate to add to the fun!</p>
<p>But there are many more strange things. If I wrote the following news, you definitely wouldn't believe it, so I cut it out of the newspaper completely. That way, you might not say I'm making things up.</p>
<p>"Since the incident a few days ago on Huifu Road in this city, where He Shengzhai paper shop and Huihe porridge shop across the street each sculpted lions, eagles, Jiang Taigong, and other objects to fight each other, the police station of the district ordered both parties to dismantle them to stop the conflict. It did not take long before a similar incident occurred in the most prosperous Changdi, which can be described as echoing the previous one. The reason is that after a certain algae shop on the newly reclaimed land on Haizhu Road in Changdi, which has no house number, was completed, it immediately drew three fierce tigers and hung them on the edge of the arcade as a call to attention. At first glance, it really looked like a splendid white-browed tiger alive. The Guangtongfa office at No. 54 across the street was very dissatisfied with the sight, thinking that the evil spirit of the white tiger overhead was no small matter, and the shop assistants were also uneasy. The shop owner then bought a statue of Xuan Tan and enshrined it in the shop, thinking that Xuan Tan could subdue the tiger and block the evil spirit. Unexpectedly, in recent days, a certain pharmacy added several more white tigers above it, and even inlaid electric lights in the tiger's eyes to increase its power. After nightfall, the eyes were piercing, revealing even more ferocity. Guangtongfa thought that they were deliberately playing pranks, so they urgently ordered a large horizontal signboard with a picture of a huge Xuan Tan with angry eyes, holding a halberd in one hand and subduing a tiger in the other, also looking ferocious. Both sides</p>
<p>fought with their magical treasures. The owner of Yixiang Tea House at the entrance of Haizhu Road, because his business had been sluggish for days, also blamed the fierce tiger across the street. He urgently asked a feng shui master to examine the situation, who also said that the white tiger overhead would bring bad luck, so he taught him how to block the evil spirit. The Yixiang owner was instructed to order two zinc-iron Li Kui statues, which were divided and stood on the signboard on the second floor. They have already been made. The statues have swallow foreheads and tiger beards, are incredibly brave, and have electric lights embedded in all four eyes. They hold double axes and are ready to fight the tiger across the street. Because Li Kui in the Water Margin had the courage to kill tigers, they used him to control the tiger, so they became a rivalry with Guangtongfa's Xuan Tan."</p>
<p>My friend, this interesting play of the white tiger, Xuan Tan, and Li Kui fighting each other is actually being performed on the busiest Changdi in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Could you have guessed this? Fortunately, you didn't come to Guangzhou, otherwise you would feel the same disappointment and sadness as I do.</p>
<h3>Before Sunrise (1)</h3>
<p>— Gao Zhi</p>
<p>In the Wanghua Village area, even the chickens that crow at dawn have been eaten. In the silence, the dark night seems even longer.</p>
<p>Aunt Qin lay awake in bed, waiting for dawn. She couldn't estimate whether it was "the second crow of the rooster" or "the third crow of the rooster," but she hallucinated that she heard the rooster crowing and felt that it was probably already past the hour of Chou. The room was pitch black. There was a faint sound of wind on the roof, and she could also hear someone crying far away in the fields. She couldn't help but feel sad again, remembering her youngest son, Laifu, who had died of starvation not long ago. Cold tears flowed from her cheekbones onto the pillow again. She couldn't bear to listen to the distant crying anymore. She worriedly calculated all night, but still couldn't think of a way to keep her daughter, Lian Di. Lian Di was sleeping next to her, snoring. She listened again, and Aunt San in the neighboring room was also sound asleep, without a single movement. She couldn't bear to let her daughter go, but if her daughter stayed at home, she would starve. Perhaps she would get sick and die like her youngest son. It would be better to be cruel and, in desperation, seek a way for mother and daughter to survive. So she decided to let her daughter leave Yuhua Village. The population of Yuhua Village was gradually decreasing. Some fled, some died, and those who remained all wanted to escape the famine. For dozens of miles around Yuhua Village, not a single flower could be seen. Tree buds and wild vegetables had all been eaten. The fish in the ponds had all been caught. The mud loaches in the dried-up pond mud had all been caught. Some people had drowned in the water while catching fish. But still, people were searching in every pond all day long. Even the duckweed in the water was being撈起来used as food. The sparrow nests on the roofs had all been searched, and the bird nests in the tall trees had all been explored. In the evening, the cawing of crows returning to their nests could no longer be heard.</p>
<p>Except for the only remaining skin-and-bones oxen, the donkeys that grind grain and the dogs that guard the night had all been eaten. On the dirt threshing ground in front of the village, which hadn't been晒穀dried in a year, one could no longer see a fat pig or a goose or a duck. All the female infants were drowned in the water, and when there was no way to feed the baby boys either, their mothers had no choice but to bury them with tears in their eyes, whispering sadly:</p>
<p>"Go reincarnate into a wealthy family sooner!"</p>
<p>It was also common for people to be beaten to death for stealing a piglet or a lamb from a distant village or town. In the wild, many men and women were digging for vegetables all day long. Whether it was on the edges of the fields or along the gullies, only a barren piece of yellow earth remained. Not a bit of green could be seen. Some people, while digging, would run out of energy and collapse, lying on the ground for two days, exposed to the sun and dew. They wouldn't even have the strength to groan. Those who heard them would deliberately avoid them out of terror and pity, unable to help. So those who could still struggle in the dirt at first would later be unable to move. Their consciousness would gradually blur, until finally yellow water would flow from their mouths. The yellow water would dry up in the dirt, and the person would starve to death. The uncared-for corpse would become</p>
<p>the valuable food of wild beasts and birds. If someone could spend a day filling their stomach with wild vegetables, they would be happy to the point of madness.</p>
<p>In this situation, when Aunt Qin heard that someone in the city was willing to take her daughter, Lian Di, she naturally had no way to keep her. Aunt San in the city was the intermediary. She had gone to the city yesterday and had gone with Aunt San to see the master in the mansion. The master was already in his forties, and his concubine couldn't bear children. He heard that Lian Di was young and beautiful and was willing to take her in. Aunt Qin ate a lunch in the mansion that was better than her own family's New Year's Eve dinner. The grandeur of the mansion made her secretly envious.</p>
<p>She had sought a divination stick at the City God Temple, and the Taoist priest had explained that the stick was good. So she accompanied Aunt San out of the city together.</p>
<p>Although she was unwilling in her heart, she was also helpless and said involuntarily:</p>
<p>"Aunt San, I think the age difference is too much."</p>
<p>"Aunt Qin, what are you talking about? The master is kind-hearted and treats people generously. Don't be indecisive. Didn't the stick say it was good?"</p>

<h3>New Changes in the American Securities Investment System</h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>Since President Roosevelt took office in the United States, he has been dedicated to industry,</p>
<p>finance, and various recovery and relief plans; although Chinese and foreign scholars have different opinions on them, they all attach importance to them. The financial panic in the United States was the severe stage of the economic panic. Examining the formation of the financial panic, it is generally attributed to the poor banking system. Therefore, studying the merits and demerits of its banking system may be the only way to explore the root cause of the financial panic and even the economic panic. For this reason, the American Blue Eagle Movement also includes policies to control the banking industry. Now, the important businesses of banks are receiving credit and extending credit; receiving credit is mainly based on deposits, and extending credit is mainly based on loans and investments. Therefore, Roosevelt's reorganization of the American banking industry started from two aspects: one is to handle deposits, and the other is to handle loans and investments. The reason for this is that only by doing both can complete success be achieved. Regarding the former, such as the so-called Glass-Steagall Bank Act, my friend Mr. Xu Yuhan has already written a special article on it, please refer to the 57th issue of this journal; the latter includes the enactment of the Securities Act (Securities Act). Now, please briefly describe the evolution of the American securities investment system and the contents of the Securities Act.</p>
<p>(II) The Rise and Fall of the Securities Investment System</p>
<p>The development of the American securities investment system is about half a century later than that of the major European countries (England, Germany, and France). In the mid-19th century, the amount of securities investment was still small. According to the figures published in the annual report of the US Treasury Department, in 1850, assets represented by securities were estimated to account for only 16% of the total US wealth. After the Civil War, marketable securities increased rapidly. Between 1865 and 1932, the types of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange increased from 136 to 1278, and the amount of bonds issued also increased from 174 to 1601 during the same period. In 1908, wealth represented in the form of securities accounted for about 23% of the total US wealth, and by 1932, it had increased to 75%. Its rapid progress is truly astonishing. The reason for this is that the public bonds issued by the federal government during the Civil War gradually became popular among individual investors. During World War I, the so-called "Liberty Bonds" were raised, which further popularized and popularized the purchase of securities. Under these circumstances, the surge in the number of American securities investors is no accident. According to conservative estimates, during the Spanish-American War, the US government raised public bonds, and about 320,000 people subscribed; during World War I, millions of people bore public bonds. (Note 1)</p>
<p>The above is only observed from its quantitative aspect. If we observe it from its qualitative aspect, the progress is quite different. Like securities investment markets in other countries, the American securities market has a general trend of value plummeting. According to the bond price index compiled by Moody's Investors' Service, it was 66.30 in 1860. It increased to 99.53 in 1902, and then gradually declined, falling to 53.90 in June 1932. That is, at the end of the 19th century, bond prices rose sharply, but in the 20th century, they plummeted and could not be salvaged. The adverse impact of the recent financial panic on the securities investment market can be seen in the following figures. The total amount of bond transactions on the New York Stock Exchange was $47,384,805,899 in January 1931, but decreased to $30,554,431,099 in April 1933. The total amount of stocks also decreased significantly: $89,668,276,854 in September 1929, but decreased to $15,633,479,577 in July 1932. (Note 2)</p>
<p>(III) Reasons for the Decline in Securities Investment</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the decline of the American securities investment industry: such as the continuous occurrence of various adverse political and economic events in the country. The decline of the European investment system also has a significant impact. Also, the prohibition of immigration, the decrease in population growth rate, the promulgation of tariff regulations, and the sharp drop in general price levels all directly affect stock interest and bond repayment, and thus indirectly affect the prices of marketable securities. However, the above-mentioned reasons are ultimately indirect, and the two major defects in the investment system itself directly determine the decline and failure of this securities investment system. These two defects are: the incompetence of the operators (sellers, buyers, and securities dealers of securities) and the overproduction of securities.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the first item. The sellers of securities are usually various companies, local autonomous groups, and governments, because these groups have the legal right to issue marketable securities. It is well known that the issuance of securities by major American companies is often based on overvalued assets, and its harm is very great. Moreover, these institutions often establish close relationships with enterprises with weak financial resources or unsound purposes, so their foundations are easily shaken. As for the state governments and local autonomous groups in the United States, they also have the malpractice of abusing funds and do not know what it means to economize on expenses. Their borrowing amount increases year after year: from 4.926 billion US dollars in 1914 to 19.285 billion US dollars in 1932. Among them, those that could not be repaid when due were only 502 million US dollars in 1914, but increased to 1.494 billion US dollars in 1932. In short, the sellers of marketable securities, whether they are private or public groups, are often unsound.</p>
<p>Next, let's study the buyers of securities. The surge in the number of direct securities investors in the United States has been mentioned above. As a result, since the 20th century, the situation in the securities investment market has been very different from the past: in the past, a small number of wealthy people owned a large amount of securities, but now it is the general public who each hold a small amount of securities. Since the amount of securities purchased by the public is small, it is only natural that they do not bother to investigate and purchase securities uncritically. However, on the other hand, the objective situation of the securities market is becoming increasingly complex. The number of securities is increasing day by day, the types are becoming more and more complex, various methods of attracting the public to purchase securities with high interest rates are emerging endlessly, and the transfer of securities is frequent. All of these cannot be understood and accurately judged by general small direct investors. The crisis of securities panic is latent here. Of course, the blame cannot be entirely attributed to this general public, even economists, bankers, government officials, and other experts cannot escape their blame. If direct investors are in such danger, how can indirect investors be any different? These indirect investors refer to the depositors and policyholders of general commercial banks, savings banks, and insurance companies. These financial institutions used to be known for their soundness, but they suffered great losses during the panic in 1920 and subsequently lost the soundness of their investment policies. These organizations, due to the high-interest fixed deposits, were forced to take risks and purchase bonds with extremely high risks in order to obtain higher interest. Therefore, customers unknowingly became indirect investors in the securities market. Although there is a distinction between direct and indirect investors, their happiness is entrusted to the securities market.</p>
<p>The third party closely related to the securities investment system is securities dealers or investment bankers. The sale of substandard securities by investment bankers may also be a factor in the decline in securities prices. However, in reality, this kind of behavior is rare. For example, the New York Stock Exchange, the representative of American securities issuers, except for the Kreuger and Toll incident, almost none of the securities listed on it are absolutely substandard.</p>
<p>However, investment bankers cannot escape most of the responsibility for the collapse of the securities investment system in recent years. Why? Because investment bankers have not adequately promoted the economic structure of the investment system. Generally speaking, investment bankers are essentially issuers, buyers and sellers, and controllers of securities, and their securities purchasing function has great social significance. In other words, investment bankers have the power to grant or withhold life and death. If they purchase certain securities, those securities can be widely circulated; if they reject other securities, those securities will disappear from the market. If these bankers can take the responsibility of benefiting society and choose securities with good quality and purpose, the financial world will naturally be stable. On the other hand, if they are blinded by profit and sell substandard securities in order to obtain high interest, will their harm be small?</p>
<p>As such, the general public in the securities investment market, who are not familiar with their investment targets and are dazzled by the current high interest rates, will inevitably look for and purchase securities that they believe are profitable. On the other hand, investment bankers, in order to compete with other peers to absorb funds, will inevitably provide securities with high interest rates and high risks to the market. In this chaotic state, the brewing of securities panic is inevitable. At the end of December 1931, Finch Bondrecord conducted a survey of 4,398 bonds at the time and produced their default rates. This can be clearly seen in the table on the left.</p>
<p>Year of Issue Number of Bonds Issued Default Rate %</p>
<p>Before 1900 70 14.8</p>
<p>1900-1913 419 14.5</p>
<p>1914-1919 206 10.1</p>
<p>1920-1922 263 18.6</p>
<p>1923-1924 631 18.4</p>
<p>1925-1926 371 21.6</p>
<p>1927-1928 228 31.1</p>
<p>1929 267 31.1</p>
<p>1930-1931 496 11.9</p>
<p>Unknown 551 22.0</p>
<p>Total 4398 20.2</p>
<p>From the above table, the depth of the economic panic can be seen from the bond default rate. During the panic in 1920, the default rate suddenly rose to 18.6. Also, when the great panic of 1929 struck, the increase in the default rate was unprecedented. All of these prove that the bond default rate is an indicator of economic panic.</p>
<p>Let's now study the second defect of the securities investment system itself - the fact that marketable securities are overproduced. Facts speak louder than words. From the table on the left, we can see the sharp increase in the amount of newly issued securities before the financial panic. (Note) (Unit: Millions of US Dollars)</p>
<p>1922 4,304 1926 6,243</p>
<p>1923 4,293 1927 7,520</p>
<p>1924 5,534 1928 7,081</p>
<p>1925 6,174 1929 7,052</p>
<p>The reason why the price of an item can be relatively stable is due to the balance of supply and demand. How is the financial market any different? If the supply exceeds the demand, the tragic fall in its price is also a phenomenon under the inevitable law of economics.</p>
<p>(IV) Overview of the Contents of the Securities Act</p>
<p>Since the contradictions of the securities investment system are as described above, if no measures are taken to remedy them, the failure of the Blue Eagle Movement can be predicted. Finance is the center of all industries. If used properly, it can create prosperity; if used improperly, stagnation will result. The Securities Act and the Banking Act of 1933 are laws and regulations aimed at improving the securities investment system. Please describe its contents in brief as follows.</p>
<p>Since the reason for the chaos in the securities market is the imprudence of securities buyers, the main task of the Securities Act is to require all securities dealers to compile reports on all aspects of their securities issuance for the Securities Commission to refer to and research, and to use this as a basis for buyers to judge the securities. Securities with unsound purposes and insufficient credit are cracked down on. If this is the case, then illegal securities will disappear from the market, and buyers will have no way to purchase them, so the crisis of the securities system can be eliminated invisibly.</p>
<p>The second purpose of the Securities Act is to restrict the "production" of securities. Since the overproduction of securities is as described above, this measure is necessary. The issuance of securities is due to the needs of the market. Since the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, the organization of the American business community has undergone significant changes. That is, weak individual units are once replaced by the organization of large companies, and among large companies, there is a tendency to form a trust system. As a result, the financial policies of the American business community have shifted from commercial credit to investment credit. In other words, large companies are throwing out their own stocks and corporate bonds in the capital market to raise funds, and small businesses are also using this new financial policy to reduce their borrowing from banks. The debts of these organizations are transformed from short-term to long-term. Its manifestation in the financial market is the reduction in the amount of checks, drafts, and other notes. On the other hand, the amount of stocks and bonds has increased. As a result, the long-term borrowing (Funded Debt) of various industries increased, and the short-term borrowing (Funded Debt) decreased.</p>
<p>Year Short-term Long-term Total Short-term Long-term Debt Debt Debt Ratio Ratio</p>
<p>1920 16,750 4,820 12,570 77.7% 22.3%</p>
<p>1930 13,300 10,658 23,958 11.1% 44.1%</p>
<p>(The unit in the table on the right is millions of US dollars)</p>
<p>Various notes (in a narrow sense) are the concrete manifestation of short-term debt, while securities are the manifestation of long-term debt. Long-term debt has doubled in ten years. Although we have no statistical figures to prove the abuse of long-term debt by various enterprises, it is very possible in theory that there is an overproduction of securities.</p>
<p>The third purpose of the Securities Act is to organize Investment Trusts. This organization is not new. After the panic in 1920, this kind of organization once appeared, but it failed due to poor management. (Note 4) However, Roosevelt's reorganization of Investment Trusts has its reasons. The failure in the past was due to the lack of coordination among the states, and places like Boston and Chicago still held different opinions. Now, the whole country is working together on the Blue Eagle Movement, and the entire financial industry is placed under a unified system, so it is clear that it will not repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>The content of the Securities Act is not as simple as that. What has been described above are only its main points. Due to space limitations, the description will end here for the time being. (Note 5)</p>
<p>(V) Conclusion</p>
<p>We have made a brief description of the prosperity and decline of the American securities investment system, its causes, and the countermeasures of the Roosevelt government. From this, we know the important position of the securities market in the national economy: the prosperity of various industries must first have the development of the securities industry, and the collapse of various industries, the securities industry can also be the best indicator. Now, the US government is also working to improve the securities industry as a prerequisite for industrial recovery. Although it is too early to criticize its plan, since it is a method of "seeking the root," the possibility of success should not be slim.</p>

<h3>Actual Records of Donations and Taxes in Hubei</h3>
<p>— Xue Wuying</p>
<p>In recent years, the calls for rural relief have been echoing in the clouds. Mr. Wang of the Executive Yuan has also proposed the slogan that to save agriculture, exorbitant taxes and levies must be abolished. This is indeed a very important task. The current administration of the government authorities inevitably commits a contradictory phenomenon. On the one hand, it heavily levies taxes and, on the other hand, it actively seeks ways to provide relief. In fact, instead of spending a sum of money on relief, it would be more appropriate to reduce government, cut officials, and abolish levies. Now that the central government has this intention and is starting with investigations, it is indeed very good news. This article intends to present some materials obtained from actual investigations in Hubei to provide a reference.</p>

Regular taxes and additional taxes are mostly once a year, with a certain limit, while temporary levies can be once, twice, or even several times a year. Moreover, these temporary fees are mostly taken from landlords. Under such exorbitant levies, the decline of small landlords is almost an inevitable trend.</p>

<h3>Finance: Silver Loan Rates Remain Weak, Copper Coins Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver loan rates remained at two cents. The morning and afternoon markets were similar, and the situation was extremely weak. With the closing of the banks on Saturday, settlement was ignored, so there was no water to add. The trading of loan bills in the market was also very sparse. In the morning market, there were over 3.4 million in transfer and new transactions. In the afternoon market, there were 300,000 transactions. There were over 400,000 transactions in the Small General Association. The money shops settled over 3.4 million in foreign exchange bills. Remittances from various sources totaled over 200,000. Banks suspended settlement operations due to the holiday. The market price of subsidiary coins, the price of Jiangnan small silver dollars generally fell. The morning market was 865 yuan, and the afternoon market was 857 yuan. As a result, trading was down 18 yuan from the previous afternoon market, with 12,000 jiao (角, 1/10 of a yuan) in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars were 793 yuan in the morning market and 792.9 yuan in the afternoon market, with 60,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 55,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins rose by 2,500 cash, to 289,000 cash, with over 25,100 strings traded, worth 8,700 yuan.</p>

<p>(Last Week's Bond Market: New High Prices Almost Daily)</p>
<p>▲ Today's January Futures Delivery Suspended ▲</p>
<p>Last week, from January 22nd to 27th, the China Merchants Securities Exchange was the last four days for January futures trading. The Fujian incident has gradually come to an end and is no longer a problem. The Fourth Plenary Session was smooth, and the environment was stable and peaceful. The local money supply was loose and abundant, and investment was difficult. The financial community and powerful figures all favored investment in public bonds. Due to the economic downturn, there were more speculators in the public bond market, so trading gradually increased compared to the past. Market prices therefore often rose and fell. On Monday, the bulls emerged, and numbers such as 4, 26, and 48 were sold off quite a bit. The official opening of the Fourth Plenary Session caused the market price to slightly weaken by about half a yuan. After that, there was no day without rising prices, although not drastically, but slowly rising, strong and firm, with new highs almost every day. On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, because it was the last three days of the January term, the basis swap caused a squeeze. Although number 46 was sold off every day, and it was known that it had goods to deliver and the quantity was large, numbers 4 and 11 were also sold off for the most part, the market price never failed to rise. From this, it can be seen that it has attracted real investment. On Friday and Saturday, only February trading was done, and besides number 46, there was nothing to mention on the seller's side. All the gangs had a strong appetite, and the rising trend was still strong. The market price still found new highs every day. Since the salt tax fourth issue broke through the 50 yuan mark, there has been a steady increase every day. It was as the reporter expected. The February salt tax has reached over 51 yuan. The February demobilization is also approaching 67 yuan. The trend and future outlook suggest that the rising trend still has the ability to continue, and there is no flaw in sight for the time being, with the hope of reaching the highest illusion green in July 1933. The results of the weekly market price showed an increase of several jiao to about 2.5 yuan. 96 also rose by 1.5 yuan. The total volume of transactions totaled 103.041 million yuan. Today is the January futures delivery day, and the market is closed for one day. The results of the highs and lows, rises and falls are listed in the comparative table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: hundred yuan)</p>

<h3>Cotton: American Cotton Rebounds 15 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was quiet and firm, with a lack of sellers. Liverpool news was good, and buying by peers caused prices to rise. As a result, spot prices rose 15 points, and futures prices rose 14 to 17 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell 5 points, and futures prices fell 6-7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 1 point. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to selling by European exporters, but later rebounded due to hedging purchases. As a result, Pingar fell 2.5 rupees, and Omra and White Roxi each fell 2.75 rupees. The original telegram records are on the left (telegram of the 27th):</p>

<h3>Grain: Thick Rice is Stagnant, Falling Nearly a Foot Again</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources of various gangs are scarce again, estimated to arrive near the 30th (over 4,500 shi). The market situation is ultimately sluggish, and there is still no possibility of a turnaround. However, looking at the overall situation, it seems to contain a sign of change. The market situation is still quiet, so the market price of the thick rice from various gangs received by the stores has depreciated by nearly a foot. However, the Northern Jiangsu gang continued to move over 1,000 bags of late rice, and its market color can be slightly stabilized. However, the middle-grade rice is still weak by several points. Duyang pointed rice is still neither prosperous nor disgraced. Shadow yuan rice is rare and seems slightly better, and Bianyuan rice has no market at all.</p>

<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Weakens Again in Hankou</h3>
<p>Due to the rise in the market price of white tung oil in Hankou last week, the market conditions in various places also became solid. However, when the foreign firms in Hankou learned that domestic sales were sluggish, the market price rise and fall depended entirely on foreign wheat, so after opening at 23.7 yuan, it stopped operating. As a result, the market became loose due to the suspension of operations by foreign firms. According to the details in the letters from Hankou in the past two days, the price has returned to 23 yuan. The Xiang tung oil arriving in the past few days is only opening at around 19 yuan. The situation has become weak again, which cannot be denied. As for Zhejiang tung oil, which was previously done at 19.78 yuan per dan for river delivery, it has also fallen in price along with the weakening of the Hankou market. According to recent reports, it has fallen to 19.12 yuan, and the settlement period is approaching, so buyers will not buy unless it is cheap, and sellers have to stay within their scope due to financial reasons. From this observation, there is probably no change before settlement.</p>

<h3>The Two-Year Anniversary of January 28th</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Amidst a murky political atmosphere and a dazed, blindly-following existence, we have turned the calendar page to the startling and still-fresh wound of "January 28th"! Time flies. The agonizing memory of countless Shanghai citizens suffering from devastation and the twenty million in wealth reduced to ashes is precisely two full years ago today! The fruit won by the blood and flesh of Shanghai's anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians is the promotion of domestic goods, or "national goods to save the nation." Thus, in the past two years, in Shanghai, we have seen "National Goods Promotion Weeks," "National Goods Exhibitions," "National Goods Year," "Women's National Goods Year," and all sorts of grand and impressive displays. As for the officially designated commemorative activities for this year's two-year anniversary of "January 28th," they include distributing leaflets about national humiliation from airplanes, observing moments of silence for mourning, and expanding the promotion of national goods. With such unanimous advocacy of domestic goods from both the government and the public, shouldn't the results of "national goods to save the nation" be remarkably impressive? Shouldn't the market for Japanese goods in China have plummeted?</p>
<p>The stark and cruel reality shatters this illusion of "national goods to save the nation"!</p>
<p>According to a report from the Shenshi News Agency on the 26th, the import value of Japanese goods in China last year still amounted to the enormous figure of 20,000 yuan. Taking Shanghai as an example, the general situation of Japanese goods dumping is as follows:</p>
<p>Cement: Last year, 513,275 dan of Japanese cement were imported through Shanghai.</p>
<p>Paper: Last year, the total amount of Japanese paper shipped to Shanghai was 1,359,353 dan, an increase of 347,797 dan compared to the previous year. The total value last year was 19,573,998 gold units, a decrease of 603,062 gold units compared to the previous year. This discrepancy between quantity and price is entirely due to the dumping of Japanese goods at reduced prices.</p>
<p>Woolen Textiles and Timber: Last year, approximately 15 million dan of lumber was shipped from Manchuria and Japan to Shanghai, with a value of about 10 million yuan. Last year, the import of Japanese woolen textiles surpassed that of England, taking the leading position.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn and Cloth: Last year, approximately 600,000 large bales of Japanese yarn and 8 million bolts of cloth were produced in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fuel: Last year, over 3.2 million tons of Japanese coal were imported through Shanghai, nearly breaking previous records, while domestic coal plummeted.</p>
<p>Fish: Last year, the quantity of Japanese fish imported into Shanghai was 12,153 dan, with a value of 29,701,263 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, Japanese factories in Shanghai's small industries, including rubber, machinery, chemical industry, ceramics, glass, liquor, umbrella manufacturing, and rayon, produce daily necessities with a total capital amounting to hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>The above figures illustrate that during the so-called "National Goods Year" of the Republic of China's 22nd year, a segment of Shanghai's bourgeoisie exerted great effort in assisting the "friendly nation's" economic aggression against China! Alas! Nothing is more grievous than a dead heart, nothing more shameful than betraying one's country. On this dishonorable anniversary of the "January 28th" incident, we witness the dead heart and cold blood of the Chinese bourgeoisie, reflected in these achievement figures! All expressions of mourning and commemorative acts of half-masting the flag cannot wash away the extraordinary shame of some merchants desperately selling Japanese goods last year. All the flag-waving and shouting for "National Goods Year" are no match for the actions of some unscrupulous merchants who secretly open their doors in the middle of the night, displaying their magical powers!</p>
<p>Without forming a social force to effectively advise unscrupulous merchants, no one is qualified to talk about saving the nation with national goods! Without effectively resisting the massive dumping of Japanese goods, no one is qualified to express their condolences to the soldiers and civilians who died in the "January 28th" incident!</p>
<p>A dead heart is a significant symptom of national demise. The figures for the dumping of Japanese goods illustrate the truth of the lifeless hearts of China's upper class. Therefore, in the future, the responsibility for saving the nation and wiping away humiliation should fall entirely on the shoulders of our impoverished compatriots.</p>
<h3>Commemoration</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Time flows like a river, and in the blink of an eye, it is again the two-year anniversary of "January 28th." Recalling the horrific bombing of Shanghai a year ago, all citizens cannot but feel endless resentment toward the imperialist and violent Japan. However, "time has passed, and circumstances have changed," and commemorating it today is fitting to use the word "sacrifice."</p>
<p>The so-called "sacrifice" (祭) has the meaning of commemoration in Japanese, but what can we do to commemorate "January 28th" now? Whatever you say is just empty talk. It is better to honestly establish such a method: arrange an incense table, make offerings on that day, and pray that "January 28th" will not happen again. This sacrifice also belongs to the meaning of "praying for peace." Praying to heaven is a grand event that has been "anciently practiced and even more fervent now." We should follow the trend and engage in a patriotic movement to save the nation.</p>
<p>However, some people suggest that on this two-year anniversary of "January 28th," we should lament the great losses at that time and carry out a "national goods movement" to compensate for it in the slightest. This method is also good, as long as it is something practically beneficial, it is worth the effort. We in your country often just give a day off and talk empty words for every anniversary. If we can do something practically beneficial on this commemorative day without speaking empty words, isn't it much better than just speaking empty words? Speaking of which, I am afraid that this "national goods movement" will become just empty talk today. Why can I predict that it will become empty talk? Look at our country's national goods movement, it is just conducting a kind of moral propaganda, and it is different from the methods of countries like England, the United States, Germany, Italy, and even India and Canada. They are actively carrying out the movement, while we are passively clamoring. The most effective way to promote the national goods movement is to boycott foreign goods, while moral propaganda is secondary. If your country cannot build "tax barriers," how can you talk about "recovering power"?</p>
<p>Therefore, the best way to commemorate the two-year anniversary of "January 28th" today is to arrange an incense table, commemorate on that day, and pray that "January 28th" will not happen again. If praying to heaven is not effective, then even the gods in heaven have no solution. Naturally, people can also have something to say.</p>

<h3>Stubborn Parents</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have an old friend who is a poor university student. He is twenty years old this year. He has fallen in love with a female student (now eighteen years old). They initially planned to wait until she came of age and then inform her parents. Unexpectedly, their affair was discovered by her older sister, aunt, etc., a month ago. (She has been living with her sister's family since her mother passed away. Her aunt happened to be there as well.) At that time, her sister and others said she was ruining the family's reputation. Her sister's husband remained neutral, ignoring both sides, but said, "You must have me read your correspondence because you are living in my house." (Her sister's husband is middle class.) My friend asked her to plead with her sister, aunt, etc., but she refused, saying that they were all feudalistic and old-fashioned, and that talking to them would be futile. My friend originally wanted to simply send someone to propose marriage, but later stopped because he could not find a suitable matchmaker (someone familiar with the other party). What now? Her father has returned from the Yangtze River steamer to her sister's house (her father works as an accountant on the Yangtze River steamer). My friend is truly anxious and worried about this matter. She, on the other hand, has been calling and writing continuously yesterday and today, urgently urging him (my friend) to send someone to propose marriage as soon as possible. Today, she suddenly sent a registered letter saying: "...Oh! This matter has now been told to my father by my aunt and others. My father then said fiercely and angrily, 'I work hard to earn money outside, but I did not expect you to be so outrageous in Shanghai, dating a boyfriend. You are truly daring. I have warned you, see what you do!' In the afternoon, I overheard my father and sister whispering, discussing taking me back to the countryside (in Pudong). If this really happens, what will we do? ××! I am so miserable. Now I ask you to send someone to propose marriage on the twenty-seventh of this month, or you come yourself to talk to my father, otherwise I only have two paths: One, I will run away and live with you (my friend's economic conditions are not good enough, and it is also an illegal act). Two, I will sacrifice my own life. Oh, I am a loyal and sincere person, I will not let you down..." My friend consulted me on what to do after reading the letter. I think there is no good way other than proposing marriage. But where can I find a suitable matchmaker who is familiar with her father? It would be too presumptuous for him to go himself. Therefore, I especially and presumptuously seek your advice, hoping that you will kindly trouble your mind and provide a good solution in the newspaper as soon as possible. Thank you very much! With best wishes,</p>

<p>Editor's Note: This mailbox has received many letters regarding marriage issues, and they are all "family obstacle" problems. We are unwilling to say anything more about this issue because family matters should not be forced. Of course, we can and should sacrifice everything for love, but doing so and causing permanent discord within the family and breaking the bond between parents and children is also a major regret in life. Therefore, we believe that solving this kind of difficulty is not a problem legally, but the concern is from the family aspect and from the factual aspect (such as what the letter said, "My friend's economic conditions are not good enough"), there are many endless obstacles, pain, and difficulties. Like the "two of them" in this letter, we believe that in the current situation, it is best for a certain gentleman to very frankly and sincerely propose marriage to a certain lady's father, and at the same time, state his personal family background, behavior, their firm wishes, and that their union is legal (that is, based on the principle that a marriage contract should be decided by the parties themselves, and that a man can enter into a marriage contract at the age of seventeen and a woman at the age of fifteen), I think this may have a successful hope, but in case it fails, then a certain gentleman can weigh his environment and resolutely decide.</p>

<p>The path that the individual should take, we cannot represent it. Finally, we would also like to say a word to parents who have children; we know for sure that parents do not want their children to have free love, and their concern for their children's future and happiness is more important than the reputation and status of their family. They are deeply afraid that their children are young and easily swayed by temporary emotional impulses, leading to lifelong mistakes; but because they focus too much on this aspect, they ignore that if their children's marriage is unhappy, and their love is suppressed, their pain is equal to being deceived and losing their footing, and this pain is lifelong, and the remedy is more difficult than for those who lose their footing. Therefore, we hope that parents should carefully consider and pay attention to their children's social activities in advance, and at the same time, guide their children with sincere advice at any time, and after the event, if their children already have a lover, then the parents should still pay careful attention to this and seek happiness for their future, but they cannot force their children and prevent them from having a good thing; as long as the other party (their children's lover) is not a swindler or a villain, then regardless of family status, economic situation, and whether their personality does not meet their expectations, they should take a step back and let their children decide their own marriage, this is our hope.</p>

<h3>Manli's Freedom (9)</h3>
<p>— Manzhi</p>
<p>"This evidence is insufficient!" Mr. Red Nose Lei shook his head and said, "Going to XX is not an easy task, let alone Renjie is not XXX."</p>
<p>"But..." Mr. Small Mustache Huang talked and stopped, he was still half-believing. Your servant Ou entered the room and said,</p>
<p>"Mr. Huang, a phone call."</p>
<p>"Where is it from?"</p>
<p>"Huang Mansion."</p>
<p>Mr. Small Mustache Huang went downstairs to answer the phone. We were still guessing this and that, without a conclusion. "I propose to look for him in the newspaper." Mr. Big Fat Zhang suggested.</p>
<p>"That's right. But we can't use his real name. If the tabloid promotes it, reputation is important." Mr. Red Nose Lei also agreed.</p>
<p>"Let's just use his academic name. People in Shanghai don't know it."</p>
<p>"Also, who will publish the advertisement?"</p>
<p>"Let's use Manli's name."</p>
<p>"No, what if Manli doesn't agree? That would be terrible?"</p>
<p>The two of them were discussing in a question-and-answer fashion. Mr. Small Mustache Huang came up the stairs with the sound of his shoes, and said as soon as he entered the door:</p>
<p>"There's a letter. A letter from Renjie to me."</p>
<p>"Where's the letter?"</p>
<p>"It's at my house. My wife just called and said she'll send it over."</p>
<p>"There's a letter, then it's clear!"</p>
<p>The first person to be happy was that Mr. Fat Zhang.</p>
<p>"Isn't your mansion very close? Why hasn't it been sent over yet?"</p>
<p>Only about a minute later, Mr. Red Nose Lei became anxious.</p>
<p>Renjie's letter said this,</p>
<p>"Friends, goodbye! A person living silently and insignificantly in this era is simply a pig. The responsibility that the era gives us is so great that we should at least contribute to pushing the great wheel of history forward a step. My past thoughts were wrong, and I have now awakened. I am embarking on a journey with a heart to fight for humanity and society. If someone in later generations remembers the glorious history of nameless heroes, I will be one of the nameless heroes."</p>
<p>"Goodbye, friends, cherish the future, and work hard each!"</p>
<p>Although this letter made Mr. Big Fat Zhang and the others suspicious of where Renjie had run off to, the fact that Renjie did not commit suicide relieved everyone's minds.</p>
<p>I returned to my own home, but received another letter from Renjie.</p>
<p>"...I used to be a selfish individualist, so I deeply wanted to possess my lover Manli completely in my heart, which was wrong. It's even more ridiculous to think about being so sad and mad because of her leaving! Old friend, if you have time, write a letter to her and tell her that Manli is free, and Renjie is also free..."</p>
<p>Manli, he said, you are free, you have the freedom to leave him, and you have the freedom not to love him. But, Manli, you also have the freedom to miss him!</p>
<p>If you already understand him now, then you also have the freedom to feel the loneliness, annoyance, sorrow, and sadness that come from loving him and missing him!</p>
<p>Your lover's old friend Chen Yue, sent from Shanghai.</p>

<p>Movie Supplement</p>
<h3>Opinions on the American Film Crew Coming to China to Produce the Film "The Good Earth"</h3>
<p>— Cao Yunxiang</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that the American film crew led by George Hill has arrived in Shanghai and will go to the mainland to shoot "The Good Earth" written by Pearl Buck. At the same time, I also heard that the Film Censorship Committee under the Nanjing Ministry of Interior will supervise the production of the film. It will never allow any plot that insults the Chinese people. The right to publish censorship is something that all countries can have, but if our government implements censorship that is too strict for the production of "The Good Earth," then I am afraid that the film will have no hope of being completed at all.</p>
<p>The reason why the author specifically raises this event for discussion is that "The Good Earth" is a world-famous literary work, and the criticisms from all sides are inconsistent. Although the original book only describes an ordinary Chinese farmer, it is extremely popular in Europe and the United States, and other literary works cannot compare with it. It describes the living conditions of Chinese farmers in great detail, and as a result, it has also aroused the opposition of some Chinese people, who believe that the descriptions of bandits, disasters, opium, and concubines in the book are nothing more than exposing the ugliness of China, and that they are exaggerated. However, in our impartial opinion, regarding customs and folklore, all countries have good and bad aspects, and bandits and disasters are not the exclusive possession of China, and the exposure of the truth can make people alert to good and evil, and promote their self-consciousness of progress and transformation, which is also the benefit of literature. Moreover, these are not the main articles in the book, but are only used to set off the story. The reason why the book is welcomed by Westerners, and why it can enable Westerners to obtain a better impression of China from the book, is the morality of the Chinese people and the personality of Wang Lung.</p>
<p>Although Wang Lung is illiterate and has no place to stand, he can still build a family through diligence and thrift. He is determined, knows right from wrong, is kind, and finally has a conscience to repent. In other countries, the creation of Wang Lung's person relies on education, law, and religion, but Wang Lung has nothing to rely on in these aspects. So, where does the element that creates his person come from? If the 400 million Chinese people can all be like Wang Lung, then China's hope is boundless. If the people can receive the benefits of education, science, law, religion, and politics, then the greatness of its future will be unmatched by any country in the world. I believe that the central meaning of this book lies in declaring this point, which is what the Shanghai Times called "aiming at assisting China overseas."</p>
<p>Wang Lung is a natural and innocent farmer, and naturally has his weaknesses, but how is Wang Lung's strong will and upright personality created? Although this is not explicitly stated in "The Good Earth," it has been pointed out in Pearl Buck's other works that Wang's character is a reflection of ancient Chinese teachings. The creation of Wang Lung's personality is due to the family education of his parents, the legacy of his hometown, the discussions of friends, and the hardships he has personally experienced. Although what is reflected by Chinese culture is only a very small part, it can still prove that there is an ancient teaching in China that cannot be ignored. This is the foundation of Chinese culture, and the new era in the future will be built on this foundation. The excellence of Chinese culture lies in this, which is precisely what China can be proud of. In this regard, there is no need to borrow the strengths of others to make up for one's own weaknesses. Professor Hogan also called this "building on the past" in the Ream Report. The conclusion of the report also said, "Christianity will cooperate with this cultural force because it helps to achieve justice."</p>
<p>Wang's good character is the foundation of Chinese culture. Although China only has one Confucius, there may be 300 million Wang Lungs. This is the ratio of quantity to quality. Therefore, our government authorities should recognize the importance of the mission of "The Good Earth," and should recognize that the film "The Good Earth" will be shown in various countries in the future, which can enable people of various countries to understand the power of Chinese culture, and at the same time, hope that the filmmakers will take announcing the beauty of Chinese culture as their purpose. In this way, the misunderstandings between the two sides can be eliminated, and the production of the film will not be obstructed.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Homecoming"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>(Produced by Tianyi, premiered in Beijing)</p>
<p>Compared with films such as "Crossroads" or "Love Tide on the Border Sea," "Homecoming" is ultimately a barely satisfactory work.</p>
<p>Indeed, the author of "Homecoming" has demonstrated his success in some areas.</p>
<p>(1) The tragedy's emotions evoke a sense of sorrowful sympathy in the audience. When Xuefen returns home with a broken heart from the hotel, her Mao Mao is already dead. This tragic situation will not alienate people but rather allow them to deeply empathize. (2) When Xuefen leaves her husband and secretly elopes with her lover, she covers her beloved daughter with a blanket with trembling hands. The conflict between love and maternal affection, although still weak (she should have expressed her courage for the passion of love), is quite profound.</p>
<p>(3) Xuefen seeing her beloved daughter whom she had abandoned in front of the Jiu Ru gate is also acceptable.</p>
<p>(4) Furthermore, the narrative of the story is quite clear and smooth.</p>
<p>However, from the script to the performance, there are still many areas that deserve discussion. Out of personal love for Chinese films, I dare not hide my opinions on "Homecoming." Perhaps these humble opinions are not entirely without help to the writers of this film.</p>
<p>(1) I never oppose valuable theoretical films that do not depart from reality. Naturally, we more urgently hope that Chinese film writers will have a more progressive and new understanding of the relationship between people. However, the author of "Homecoming" has no understanding of the latter at all. They do not have a real understanding of social institutions, but rather very sadly and with relatively naive techniques, depict this almost accidental tragedy (in fact, the current society has more common truths than this) without grasping its social basis and developing new prospects.</p>
<p>(2) As stated in "Homecoming," there are many enlightened women who first feel the pain of love in feudal society and boldly pursue their beautiful illusions. However, from the May Fourth Movement to the present, in China in the weak so-called industrial era, especially when the economic panic has shaken the entire society and natural disasters and wars occur frequently, the very fragile current society cannot accommodate these people. Therefore, many tragedies inevitably unfold. This is a very serious economic problem. Therefore, the author of "Homecoming" should strengthen their understanding of this aspect. For example, emphasizing the severity of the unemployment problem and very clearly explaining the monetary basis of love. However, the author of this film does the opposite and only strives for the childishness of love. Especially the conflict between Shouzhong and Li Li is even more ridiculous.</p>
<p>(3) Let me be more specific. I believe that after Xuefen combines with Shouzhong, the emphasis should be on the issue of unemployment. Although love is wonderful, the issue of livelihood is more urgent. This may write about her and him being exhausted by life, and even Shouzhong dying from diligence and poverty. In this way, the newborn Mao Mao also dies from poverty and illness, which sets off Xuefen's grief even more. Moreover, in this way, it closely touches the real social problems. And perfect love can only succeed in a society that has abolished economic constraints.</p>
<p>(4) I think the author of "Homecoming" should realize that the relationship between Shouzhong and Li Li would not exist. Why would Li Li love Shouzhong? Why would Shouzhong accept Li Li's love? Is love really unconditional in Li Li's eyes? Li Li is just a small "vase," and Shouzhong is just a pitiful poor scholar. As for a female employee being able to live in a luxurious hotel, it is a deceiving joke. Moreover, portraying a rich woman buying love with money like in "Spring Tide" (the expressions of Ruan Lingyu and Lin Chuchu in "Life") is just a boring trick. Therefore, this episode is not necessary at all.</p>
<p>(5) There are many other imperfections. For example, Jiu Ru's transformation — not indulging in pleasure but striving for a proper career — is not clearly explained. Why would Xuefen go blind? When Xuefen encounters her beloved daughter born with her ex-husband, she should have intensified the emotions of the drama at the time or afterward. After Xuefen leaves Shouzhong, she should have intensified her psychological description and the greatness of maternal love. As for the final writing of the decline of Li Li and Shouzhong's three love rivals when they meet, that kind of gratifying move is very clumsy. This is not only a great coincidence, but why would Li Li and another man be so down and out? It's really too much of an afterthought. Other things such as writing "not without..." on the subtitles and the long process of writing "one year two years" are completely unnecessary, because this is nothing more than to give them time to have children, and it is not strange to have children in the second year. After a few years, Shouzhong is still wearing that suit, and Xuefen is still wearing those shoes. These all show the carelessness of the production.</p>
<p>(6) However, Huang Manli's acting skills are very good, which can be seen from "Midnight Gunshots." It is a pity that there are not more performance opportunities in this film. Others such as He Zihang and Wei Guangshou (?) are also acceptable, but only Chen Yan is directed by the director into an unaccomplished role. Other filming techniques are not bad. Especially the dubbing of the Beijing Grand Theater adds a lot to the drama's emotions.</p>
<h3>"The Survivor" Review</h3>
<p>— Stubborn Stone</p>
<p>To The Lay Man</p>
<p>In the low-brow Western movie category, this is perhaps a relatively highly-rated work.</p>
<p>A feud, a generations-long feud, brutal killings, and plunder. Within it, there is good and evil, the good being bullied, resolved in officialdom, the result being that the murderer is only sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. Therefore, after the evil-doer is released from prison, he allies with bandits to seek major revenge. As a result, this honest family suffers countless deaths and injuries. The revenge for the killing of a father can never be resolved by the authorities, so they have no choice but to resort to violence directly to "stop killing with killing." However, the daughter of the evil-doer forms an unbreakable bond with the son of the good man. Love eliminates the feud.</p>
<p>Here, we can see the entirety of the author's ideology. Only the power of love can transcend everything. I don't think there is anything here that is worth strict criticism, isn't everything said very clearly?</p>
<p>The play is still good to watch if we lower our expectations. Besides the war scenes, several fight scenes are also very realistic, especially the final deliberate surprise, where the bandit does not die from a pistol but from a knife point.</p>
<p>Another brilliant point is that in the midst of the great slaughter, a child risks his life to save a sheep, trying to express the inherently good nature of humanity. Secondly, the heroine kicks back the clothing bag given to her by her lover due to the family feud, even setting it on fire and then hurriedly taking it out of the fire. This is related to the previous times she saw her enemy, who is also her lover, and secretly cried after he left. The inner depiction of love and hate is indeed very vivid. In addition, the description of the woman's personality, riding unruly horses, wearing torn pants, bathing in the pond, and scolding her lover, all show her wild and innocent nature.</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that the narration of the story is not very smooth and clear, what is called the editing is not rigorous. As for having to add subtitles to explain when a person appears on stage, it is also unnecessary. All aspects are similar to the productions of small Chinese companies, but the technology is a little more advanced.</p>
<p>However, these kind of childish fighting movies will inevitably be spurned by audiences in the near future.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Christina, Queen Christina (1)</h3>
<p>— Watson</p>
<p>(A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Production, Starring Greta Garbo and John Gilbert)</p>
<p>In the palace of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, the young Queen Christina is dealing with many important military and national affairs. On the table are many reports submitted by Prime Minister Oxenstierna. She feels tired and bored... This constant request – a request for war... a request for peace... a request for money... a request for the Queen to marry Charles Augustus, the leader of their army. She looks at the heavy snow outside the window, wishing she could transform into that fluttering snow, forgetting herself... abandoning the world...</p>
<p>Prince Charles returns from the battlefield, victorious, wanting to reiterate his marriage proposal to the Queen. But the Queen receives him, congratulates him on his achievements on the battlefield, cleverly avoids the question, and ignores the Prime Minister's repeated requests. Prime Minister Oxenstierna continues to eloquently state that her marriage to Prince Charles is of great importance, can stir up the patriotic feelings of the people, and can enable Parliament to pass a budget for training new troops. At the same time, Finance Minister Magnus also advocates that the Queen marry as soon as possible. And also advocates for war, but Queen Christina always feels out of tune.</p>
<p>Christina can be said to detest war. Since the founding of Sweden, it has been in a state of war at all times. Her father, Gustavus, died on the battlefield of Lützen. He raised her as a boy, making her ears accustomed to the sound of cannons, wanting to hone her spirit to be like his own - that kind of soldier's spirit. She wanted to obey her father's orders, but... she said firmly: "There must be an end to the war. Otherwise, wouldn't we be returning to the barbaric era!" After she finished speaking, a chorus of disapproval and ridicule arose around her, but Christina waited for their voices to subside, and she continued: "What is the result of singing this high tune? Death and destruction! I now want my people to learn the arts of peace - the art of life. What I need is peace, and I must obtain peace!" Ignoring all the ridicule and the men's arguments, she stamped a king's seal on the treaty of peace with the enemy.</p>
<p>Many ministers came to see her, many meaningless disputes and debates. Sir Whitlocke, the British ambassador... the French ambassador... etc., Queen Christina quickly dismissed their affairs. In the end, everyone left, only Prime Minister Oxenstierna remained standing still. He said: "I must issue a warning to Your Majesty, the special envoy of King Philip of Spain is about to arrive. He will be here for a day or two. You must not arouse the people's fear of Catholic marriage ceremonies. Sweden is a Protestant country. To serve Sweden is Your Majesty's divine duty." He then returned to the issue of the Queen's marriage. (To be continued)</p>
