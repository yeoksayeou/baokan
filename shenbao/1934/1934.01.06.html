<p>舒·</p>
<p>丨西門與墨索里尼晤面以後丨</p>
<p>英外長西門與黑衣宰相墨索里尼會晤於羅馬。其談話内容究竟如何。是否成立具體恊定。吾人就時間與事理上觀察。恐尙不能如此迅速。惟意首相之意見。偏重於國際聯盟人爲的變則。與軍備縮小之技術問題。夫意大利於去年年底。卽已發表改組國際聯盟。自表面觀察。似充分同情於德國之修改凡爾賽條約運動。與法蘭西對立。亦甚明顯。其實意國欲借德或之力以制抑法國。且借改組國聯以改變現時國聯會議席上小國與大國有同等投票權之組織。用以减削法國在中歐之操縱。增加意大利制覇之可能性。此種舉動。固足以引起德意志若干之同情。然而在另一方面。則反將惹動中歐諸小國之反感。蓋彼等受法國之領導。尙可因對抗德國之故。而間接取得若干利益。在國際聯盟會議席上。亦有發言審議之餘地。設使意國提議果見實施。則小國旣得權利。將不免被剥奪國家主義過度發展以後。小國之生存。殊爲可慮。因是小恊約必愈加依附法國。而波蘭之對抗德國。亦必更趨嚴重。吾故謂意大利之欲改組國聯。終不過一種片面的理想而已。</p>
<p>至於變更盟約第十六條修正各國領土不可侵犯之規定務令國聯盟約皆具實行之可能性。是說也。已根本否定國際聯盟。重演國際糾紛。加甚歐洲以至世界各國之僵局。緣國際聯盟向來高標和平主義。國際合作。其實當世各國。無論在經濟上政治上。莫不趨向於鎖國主義。如經濟聯盟也。增加關稅也。充實軍備也。添建軍艦也。軍需工業之提倡也。種種事實之表現。莫不以凖備戰爭爲前提不過主要國家除日本而外。皆靜持和平狀態。於武力之運用。尙不肯輕於冒險者。則此僅具形骸之國際聯盟。於外交塲中不無微力也。假令此種僅有道德範圍之規定而一併除去。竊恐野心國家。將愈見蠻橫而無所底止耳。</p>
<p>軍備縮小問題。以整個世界觀察。一年以來。各國似皆放棄和平運動。轉趨於軍備之競爭。在資本主義諸國。大都整備軍實。使其現有軍隊强力化。卽社會主義之蘇聯。亦正努力於充實國防。軍隊之機械化。與國民總動員之凖備。且駕日本而上之。則所謂軍備縮小。最多不過爲暫時之緩和。略避當前經濟恐慌之狂潮耳。今歐洲形勢。德法爭執。最有短兵相接之虞。此所以不能不更尋緩和之道也。</p>
<p>所謂一九三六年之危機者。并不始於歐洲。特海軍三大國因華盛顿條約滿期。凖之當前情勢。五·五·三之比率。勢難再續。日本平等要求。更不易爲英美所容。認太平洋海上覇權。尤其是西太平洋方面。已爲日本所刦制。美國爲開發將來市塲保持目前狀况起見。不能不擴充其現有海軍力。日本當然急起直追。英國又焉肯落後。於是海軍競賽開端。危機益形顯露。惟是日本國力有限。近代工業雖有相當發展。惟天然富源薄弱。經濟上之開發。殊非短時期所能見效。以故日外長廣田特重新設定外交方針。大放日本軍事行動之烟幕。欲以展緩軍事的競爭。脫出其國際上之孤立。惟其如此。國聯之立塲乃愈困難。軍備縮小之名詞。事實上恐適得其反也。</p>

<p>本月九日開第一班</p>
<p>招商局海晏輪、前因開闢瑞安平陽航路、引起南市各輪避不快、結果、海晏輪奉部令停航、迄巳半年、現瑞平航路、暫行擱置、海晏輪經大修之下、業已呈請交部復航、茲已奉到批令、准予恢復溫州班、亟將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c89">海晏停班原因 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>海晏輪船齡、雖已超過四十年、照例似已失去航行資格、但船身鋼板與機器引擎等、比較任何海輪爲佳、新造輪船、亦所不逮、上次停航、被溫州永嘉等各公團向交部電呈攻訐、以致停駛、已逾半載、該局當派嘉禾代航溫州、</p>
<h3 id="c90">入塢大修竣工 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>招商局當局、以海晏輪船身優美、不忍廢置、遂於停班之後、由船務科計議、將該輪澈底大修、舉凡船内各項機件、以及各種鋼板、稍有不合便卽更新、又將客位改善、房艙刷新、在大修之際、更屢次請航政局技術科、派員到輪勘騐、以符定例、直至現、在始告竣工、全輪煥然一新、雖新建海輪、亦不及其堅固完善</p>
<h3 id="c91">部令准予復航 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>海晏將修竣時、該局卽呈報交通部、請求仍令恢復上海溫州航綫、以便利往來旅客、蓋海晏輪速力極强、由滬至甌、祇二十八小時、便可到達、在滬溫班内、最爲乘客所歡迎、停班之後、溫州帮要求復班、亦已接踵、茲經交部批令海晏旣經大修、又經航政局檢騐合格、准予復班、仍駛溫州、</p>
<h3 id="c92">九日擬開首班 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>該局奉到部令後、連日已在凖備復班手續、値此溫州方面、因時局關係、旅客之乘船來滬者、十分擁擠、故已議定、准於本月九日、開始復航溫州、惟前次所擬闢之瑞安平陽等新航綫、刻因閩變發生、瑞平客貨早經停辦　市面受軍事打擊、故暫緩開航、上海溫州班輪、則仍用海晏與廣濟行駛、</p>

<p>（二）</p>
<p>▲機器工業之影響　機器工業發達、則集多數工人於一處、技術之傳授、欲仍如昔日師徒間授受方式、勢所難能、且工塲出品、計時程功、敎授生徒、費時必多、欲以生徒敎授、於生産工塲中同時舉行之、耗時旣多、損失必大、於是生徒技術之訓練、不得不劃出工塲以外、而有開班設敎之必要、此則職業敎育之始有組織、而發動於雇主者也、</p>
<p>▲社會羣衆之自覺　歐洲自工業革命以後、工人生活、日就富裕、國民敎育、亦漸普及、於是一般工人及低級受雇人員、每因其見識日增、反感覺本身學力之不足、有求智識上進之必要、在英國倫敦、於十九世紀之初、巳有機工學校（MechaniesLnstitutes）、工人學校（WorkiugmensColleges）等之組織、皆由工人團體、自動發起、及後、又有工人夜校、靑年夜校等、在密８</p>
<p>列氏（Ｃ·Ｔ·Ｍillis）所著工業敎育一書中、關於８</p>
<p>工業敎育之發達、有下列一段、</p>
<p>一當時有二種力量、正在推動、其一、爲工人對於政治及社會不安定之感想、其二、爲求其本身之進步、及提高本行職業地位之慾望、故於工人技術、及繼起靑年工人之訓練、至爲關心、於科學原理、應用於職業者、尤求之若渴、職業敎育運動、實由此數種力量而産生、］此則職業敎育原動力之發生於工人本身者也、</p>
<p>▲世界經濟市塲之競爭　歐洲　各國、關心職業敎育利、均認職業敎育與國家整個經濟組織、有絶大關係、蓋歐洲國家、若英·若德、若比、皆爲工業生産過量之國家、其國内經８</p>
<p>濟之命脈、全在以生産品征服世界市塲、爲之尾閭、其能否以生産品推銷世界之市塲、則全在出品之精美與適用、成本之减低、運費之節省等等、凡此數者、皆非從良好完備有組織之職業敎育入手、不爲功、意大利當局之言曰、［一國實業之發達、有數種必備之條、件如原料·信用·商輪·新市塲之擴展、及必不可缺之專技工人、若由學校、以科學合理之方法訓練之、則其保障、尤爲穩固、］密列氏亦謂［一國之實業、欲謀於國際市塲内、占一位置、必須以職業敎育、以爲後、盾］英國於一八八三年、成立全國工業敎育促進會（ＴheNationalAssociationForThe*</p>
<p>PromotionofTechnicalEducation）其宣言之要旨、有下列數項（註二）（a）凡敎育上之改革、可以增進實業界服務人員之技能、應鼓勵之、（b）應加緊靑年者、手與目之訓練（c）凡科學及算術之原理、爲國家實業基本、應設法使之更爲普及、</p>

<p>訓、欲求成本之减低、必藉優良之技術、近代工藝、欲爭勝於國際間、必須有經過學校訓練、孄習最新方法之技術人員、供其驅遣、方能收效、］於此可見歐洲國家之對職業敎育、視若國家生命所繫托、宜乎莫不提倡不遺餘力也、</p>
<p>我國社會經濟現狀、其枯竭窮窘、已達極點、至爲明顯、推其原因、一言以蔽之、卽受各國工業製造品傾銷之結果、每年漏、巵、達十數萬萬之巨、卽所謂經濟侵略是也、補救之道、不外二途、一、抵制外國貨品、二、興辦製造業、前者爲消極的、不能持久、而非自然的方法、後者爲建設國家、積極而富有希望的途徑、故職業敎育、實爲當今之急務、然職業敎育之發展、必須有適宜之環境、如魚之必須有水、草木之必須有雨露、我國中小學及高等敎育、尙未能上正軌、獨欲於職業敎育、求全責備、勢所難能、此其一、職業敎育、以小學敎育爲根基、在初等敎育、尙未整個整理之時、欲求職業敎育、得圓滿之結果、反事理之常、此其二、當局者、雖知職業敎育、爲抵抗經濟侵略唯一之工具、然是否能體會其重要、果敢而執行、此其三、地方政府、與敎育當局、情形稍爲閛隔、則奉行不力、收效不多、此其四、有此四者、我國職業敎育、求其盡量發展、在短期間内、實爲難能之事、其他若推行之方法、與經費之籌措、猶餘事耳、茲略舉職業敎育之範圍、及其與社會經濟、地方需要之關係、以明職業敎育之大意、歐洲各國職業敎育之現狀、則於次章中分述之、</p>

<p>（一）農科學校　如農事·森林·詞畜·蔬菓·蠶桑·釀造·園藝·農村經濟等是、</p>
<p>（二）商科學校　除普通商科外，亦有兼辦駐外使領館服務職業科者、</p>
<p>（三）工科學校　如機械·電機·建築·紡織·採礦·化學工程等、</p>
<p>（四）工藝學校（ＴradeScbools）</p>

<p>（五）航務學校　如駕駛·機輪等、</p>
<p>商科學校、及工科學校、亦有統稱爲TradeSchools者、而SchoolsofArtsondCrafts有時用以包括工科學校、及工藝學校之一部、故在名稱上、欲將各類職業學校、條分縷析、不相混淆、殊非易事、上列五類、僅其大較耳、</p>

<p>國聯敎育考察團報告書、對於我國敎育改革事宜、供獻甚多、其再三懇切言者、有二點、（一）我國學校課程、太不切近人民實際生活、（二）中學課程、不宜專爲學生升入大學之凖備、其在論職業敎育之一節、復謂曰、</p>

<p>歐洲各國之政治家、皆高瞻遠矚、知國民經濟力之充實、不僅在國民之足衣足食而巳、尤須擴展世界市塲、以銷售其過剩之生産、市塲愈廣、銷售愈多、則國民所獲愈豐、而財力亦愈雄厚、此其成功、皆藉職業敎育爲之基礎、其在我國、若亦能謀擴展世界市塲、吸收外國資源、以爲國内財窮之調劑、固屬急要、然除原料品外、以機器製造工業落伍之我國、欲以生産製造品、與各國爭勝、决非數十年内可能之事、照我國現狀、職業敎育着手之第一步、除必要之機器工業外、更８</p>
<p>宜維持我國固有之手工業、國家之貧、與國内游惰失業者之多寡、常成比例、游惰日增、生産者日减、寄食者日衆、則國力必日竭、此必然之理也、國内巨城大埠、爲匪盜淵藪、竊丐　集、旣不生産、又爲禍患、國家損失之大、難以數計、而鄕村小鎭、因農村經濟崩潰、舊有手工業日就衰落失業者日見增加、此實爲國家最大之隱憂、長此不治、全國經濟破産、可以立見、目前之急要、除一方面以政治力量、維持治安、使民衆均得安居樂業外、更須以敎育方法、使生産上增進、技術上改良、庶農村事業、得漸恢復、手工業不致盡被淘汰、社會經濟、及國民生活、與職業敎育息息相關、卽在於此、比利時人有言曰、［英人富自動精神、法人富美感思想、然終不若德人之好技術敎育力量之偉人、故德意志得有今日世界上優越之經濟地位、］在近代經濟戰爭、經濟侵略、猛烈之漩渦中、我國若不於工藝職業敎育上努力、以求立足地、則全國新舊生産事業、將日被排擠蹂躪、行見衰敗殆盡、其危險有不堪設想矣、</p>
<h3 id="c180">三、職業敎育須適合地方之需要 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>我國現有國立省立及私立職業學校、全國不亞三百餘所、依種類分别、則有工·農·商·醫·音樂·美術·法政·水産·鹽務·海關·郵務·電政·商船·警務等、惟海關·鹽務·郵政·電政·警務等學校·其性質旣異常專門、而又與直接生産、關係至薄、故職業學校之與國家經濟有直接關係者、當爲工農商三類學校、蘇俄Svadkovsky敎授、於所著［蘇俄敎育］一書中、告吾人曰、蘇聯國内學校、有百分之八十、爲工程職業學校、全國學生、在工程職業學校中者、占百分之九十五、照法國統計、全國人民、在農工商三界服務者、居百分之八十、故職業學校之爲農科工科商科、其需要最爲急切、可以想見世界各國情形相若、我國農工商各科之專門或高中職業學校、其創立之時、由各省及地方政府自動之力量爲多、故學校設立地點、能分佈各省、惟各省之學校、其環境與地方工商業、及原料供給情形、雖相差甚遠、而各校所設科别、則皆大略相同、而農科學校設在之地點、又每非農村事業之中心、故學生大半非８</p>
<p>農人子弟、畢業後、又不就農村服務、或從事耕牧、因此原由、則農科學校、失其設立目的、喪其效用、於農村事業、旣於技衝上無所供獻、又於人才上難以引進、似等於虛設、工科學校、及工藝學校、則偏重新式歐美工藝者居多、提倡我國舊有工藝者殊少、卽多注重機器工業、而忽略手工業、如機械工科、電機工科、土木工科、幾各校皆設立之、且有數校、並設立應用化學工科者、在基本化學工業、一無基礎之我國、宜乎學生畢業後、就業服務問題、常爲學校最棘手之事、反之、人生日用需要之事業、或各省各地固有特殊之工業、若傢具不器製造、磚瓦石灰製造、竹器籐器工業、五金器具工業、以及製瓷業、陶器業、漆器業、皮革業、刺繡業、牙刻業等、皆基礎巳具、社會需求甚殷、乃旣乏專校以供研究、又無專科、以造就技術人才、故各業藝術、皆封於故步、一無進境、甚者且有就衰之勢、觀丹麥Copenhagen大學、因皇家製瓷廠、而特設製瓷工程科、有愧色矣、總括言之、我國現有職業學校、除少數例外外、每有下列數種缺點之一種或數種、一、設科不切合地方特殊情形之需要、二、設立地點、不盡適宜、三、設備欠完備、四、敎材欠切實用、五、忽視我國舊有手工業、或者謂我國舊式工藝、向由師徒間授受、無設學敎授之必要、此不盡然、我國舊有工藝、常退步而少進步、卽因墨守成規之故、在歐洲各國、一切工藝學科、幾皆以應美術爲基礎、故成品之式様配色等、均具美術思想、適合常人心理、故銷售暢遼、業務日盛、此爲工藝技術上極重要之一點、法國職業敎育家之言曰、</p>
<p>［工藝敎痛、須應時代經濟之需要、而培養其人才、故富彈性的、並須於出品銷售、令學生注意各方之經濟狀况、故亦爲進步的、］英國敎育部出版之［歐洲工藝學校］一書中、亦稱［工藝學校·······必須注意實業界之變遷輿需要。］我國過去職業敎育之不能表現優良成績、最大原因、卽爲未注意實業界之變遷情形與需要、及各方經濟之狀况、換言之、卽未適合地方需要是也、因之、畢業學生之就業、常爲一大問題、或賦閒無所用、或改就他業、職業學校、在社會上之信用與地位、蒙至大之損失、故職業學校之須適合地方需要、爲第一要義也、（註一）上海中華職業敎育社所辦之職業學校、及各省省立職業學校、亦有成績者、惟爲數不多、（註二）見英國敎育部出版之TradeSchoolsontheContinnet”一書、</p>

<h3 id="c206">無線電心理測騐器 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>最近英國科學家孟郁飛利浦氏（ＭajorPhilip），創製一極有趣的無綫電儀器，名之曰無綫電心理測騐器（ＲadioPsychoetry)實爲無綫電應用於心理學的第一聲，各國均盛傳其說，茲述之以餉讀者。</p>
<p>此器極爲靈敏，無論何人，接近此器，卽生效應；如以手靠近預設的銅板，效應更著，此項現象，以前的解釋，都認爲因人體電容量的關係，使眞空管内栅至燈絲的極間電容量變更，所以輸出的屏流，亦隨之變更；孟郁飛利浦氏却否認此說，謂最近無綫電學家，曾以高貴的儀器，證明人體的四圍有電塲存在，並謂無綫電通訊中，有極多的現象，先之推說爲人體電容量者，或卽均由於此電塲（ElectricField）的效應亦未可知。</p>
<p>我們都知人體的耗阻，隨人的行動情感而變更，精密的儀器，可在人受突然震驚時，得一紀錄，故所謂電容时的效應，或屬於另一種現象，此理亦極近情。</p>
<p>圖係美國無綫電學者試騐此器的綫路，極似通常的成音週率放大綫路，以簾栅管作輸入管，經過一高迥阻初級的成音週率變壓器，饋至三極輸出管，輸入管的栅路爲開路（Opencircuit），僅有銅板一塊連接栅極，如以手置近此板，輸出管的屏流卽變更，指示此屏流的電流表，可以靈敏的千分安培表與輸出變壓器的初級相並聯；不同人的手，置近銅板時，可以測得不同的屏流，爲使紀錄清楚起見，最好以4.5v的Ｃ電及0.5Ｍeg的變量耗阻，接在電流表的兩端，阻止原來的屏流經過此表，再配合此變量耗阻，使此器應用時，原有的屏流指數，適爲零度，電位器Ｒ，用以調節此測騐器的穩定度及靈敏度。</p>
<p>此器應用時，須另添一裝置，使各被測騐者的手與銅板間的距離，完全相等，然後測騐所得的結果，方可凖確。　　實騐的結果，尙未有結論發表，但可深信因不同的人，可測得不同的結果，根據此不同的結果，一定可將人類依照其神經的性情或心靈的活動，分爲若干類别，此問題現正公開給大衆，歡迎試騐，更期待試騐的結論。</p>
<h3 id="c207">直讀式眞空管電壓表 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>普通的交流電壓表，祇能用來測量週率極低的交流電壓，如果拿來測量成音週率（Ａudiofrequency）或高週率（Ｒadiofrequency）電壓，便不能適用。</p>
<p>有一種呌做熱電流表，（Ｔhermoammeter）牠是利用熱漲冷縮的原理而構成的。當電流通過一導體時，便會發熱，導體遇熱卽漲，因此便能推動電表的指針。此種電表，測量任何週率的電流，都很凖確。不過，在電學上熱是與電流的平方（Ｌ２Ｒ）成正比的，電流過小，便不能推動指針，所以此種電表，在測量電壓時便失功效。</p>
<p>自從三極眞空管發明後，便有人利用牠來做高週率電壓表，此種電表，使用時消耗外界的電力極小，所以得到的８</p>
<p>數値，便異常凖確。</p>
<p>觀第一圖甲，便知三極眞空管栅極電壓與屏流的關係，當栅極電壓爲負五伏次時，屏流適减至零點，此時栅極如接到外來正電壓，悌流卽見增加，如接到負電壓，屏流仍爲零點。觀圖abcd···及ＡＢＣＤ等自明）如高週率電壓接於屏極上，得到的屏流，便如1,2······等形狀。此種單向電流，當然能使屏路中千分安培表移動的。（參閱第一圖乙）</p>
<p>第一圖甲</p>
<p>第一圖乙爲眞空管電壓表之接綫圖，當外來高週率電壓接在ＸＸ兩點後，屏路中串聯的電表卽有紀錄。由屏流之大小卽可推知外來電壓的數値。</p>
<p>上述的眞空管電壓表，構造雖極簡單，但事前必須先將各種已知數値的交流電壓，輪流測量，繪成外來電壓與屏流的曲綫圖後，纔能按圖計値。此外丙電壓與乙電壓的數値，先後必須絶對相同，否則得到的紀錄，便不能凖確。</p>
<p>爲了要避免上述的困難，另外有一種呌做滑動眞空管電壓表，（SlidebackVacuumTubeVoltmeter）牠的丙電壓是可以任意調節的。結果，外來電壓的數値，便可在栅極電壓表Ｖ内直接算出。</p>
<p>第二圖乙Ｒ１爲相當數値之電位表，使用前先調節Ｒ１使屏流數値爲零。（此時栅極丙電壓數値，假定爲E１）當外來交流電壓Ｅ，接在ＸＸ處後，屏流必見增加，（如　　第一圖甲1,2···等狀態）再調節Ｒ１，仍使屏流數値减至零點爲止，此時丙電壓必較Ｅ１爲大。（如第二圖甲Ｅ２）依交流電壓公式，其增加之數値，（Ｅ２Ｅ１）如乘以１·４１４，卽等於外來交流電壓之有效値。（Effectiveorrootmeansquarevalue）　　例如最初丙電壓Ｅ１爲十伏次·外來高週率電壓Ｅ接入後，丙電壓Ｅ２增至二十伏次，依上述公式，得：</p>
<p>外來高週率電壓Ｅ＝（２０｜１０）Ｘ１.４１４＝１４.41弗打（有效値）</p>
<h3 id="c208">私密無綫電的樞紐超短波 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡光華</p>
<p>二十世紀的今日，無論戰時平日，傳遞私密消息這件事，完全在一般實騐超短波的業餘家的掌握中。我們知道，波長的區别是相對的，並不是絶對的。十米突以下的波長，就所謂超短波，從十米突到二百米突是警備和業餘家合用的波長，其次是廣波範圍，再次一直到二萬米突的是長波。</p>
<p>短波輸出以後，在天空和地球的表面上回折書，這種折射高度，大槪有一英里左右。可是超短波的性質，却不同了，輸出以後，並不折回。到底往那裏去了，還是一件不可捉摸的事。放射超短波，一定要和接收超短波的機器在同一水平線上。（指私密的而言）。</p>
<p>［光播］（Ｂeamcasting）是應用超短波上的一個專門名詞，辦法是將言晤成音樂從一種微弱而看不見的光上輸送出去。美國惠司汀好司無綫電公司孟路西富博士（Ｄ１·Ｉ·Ｅ·Ｍouromfseff）曾經在最近造過一具，用109公尺的波長，作過一次表演試騐。在光播的時候，他將。０９公尺的超短波集中在一面抛物綫形的鏡上（ParabolicMirror）,然後由鏡本身，將光集中成長而狹小的形狀（大多是平行的，並且並不散漫）。同時在超短波收音機裏，也有一面抛物線形的鏡子，將光集中在一根不到二英寸長的天線上，因爲光跑的路是直線的，所以這種輸送，　　在同一平面上。不過倘使這種器械設置在離地面高一些的地方，射程方面，可以增加一些，那是無疑的。所以高樓崇閣，塔巔山柨頂，都是光播的最好地位。孟博士的機器，在一英里左右試騐時，成績很好，據他的猜想，以爲二十英里一定也可以收到。他說軍隊裏如果設置一器，對於傳遞消息方面，一定可以私密不少。他希望不久的將來，射程方面能夠再增加一些，那麽，實用之期，一定不遠了。</p>
<h3 id="c209">輕便之電力供給器 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— ＢＦ</p>
<p>此處所述之電力供給器，乃根據振動式變壓器之原理而製造。（請參閱本刋四十二期直流電怎様用變壓器一文）</p>
<p>可使低壓直流電變爲高壓直流電，以供屏極高壓電流之用。此器構造簡單，且亦可接至交流電線上應用。</p>
<p>此器乃將一普通小電工率之電源變壓器，整流器及濾波器，照平常方法連接。另加接一六弗打蓄電池及一與蓄電池串連之福特式星線圈（Ｚuricsparkcoil）至電源變壓器上一未用之五弗打線圈上。其接線情形，詳附圖。</p>
<p>該電源變壓器中心分線之二邊，各有三百伏脫。照圖中所示之電力供給器，卽可直接供給小電力發射機之用。若欲供收音機之用，則須再加接一濾波阻流圈，及一個八分法拉特之固定電容器：並將器中之電星線圈，置於一通地之金屬匣内卽可。若此器在有交流電之處應用，則逕接該電源變壓器之初級至電線上卽可。</p>
<p>至機中眞空管陰極所需電流，亦可自此電力供給器中得之。若能用電流式或省電式眞空管，以蓄電池或乾電池供給陰極電流，則較爲簡便。</p>
<h3 id="c210">超短波之性質 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— ＶＴ</p>
<p>普通廣播電台之波長大抵二百分尺至六百公尺，校此長者爲長波。較此短者爲短波。輕多年研究之所得，知短波長最適於遠距離通信。尤其是二十公尺左右適用於畫間，四十公尺左右適用於夜間這是受空中電子層的反射而如此的。十公尺甚至一公尺以下，特稱之爲超短波。他們的性質尙在研究試騐之中。去年末來華的馬可尼，更加努力研究。他曾在野外作種種的實騐，巳知此項超短波其反射屈折較短波更爲顯著。所以往往可用抛物綫形之反射器使之聚成一束，而向單方向發射。</p>
<p>波長在一公尺以下之電波，他的性質幾與光綫完全相同。所以又稱光式電波。我們知道探海燈之裝置，是用一具抛物綫鏡，裝在發光器的後面由發光器８</p>
<p>所發射光的綫，經抛物鏡的反射，便向單方向進行，光力不致散失，遂能直射遠處，同様超短波，亦可利用金屬體作成抛物綫形的反射天綫或反射器使電波集成一束而向單主向發射。此時電波不８</p>
<p>像普通的四散，電力雖少而可直達遠處了。如在收音處亦用反射器將傳來的平行的電波後聚合於焦點，則即可重得發來的音信。馬可尼所在研究不息的，便是這一點。</p>
<p>數年以前英法海峽間，曾作遇一次光綫電話的試騐，聽說很有成効。這種光綫稱爲MicroRay，也是極短電波的一種。試騐時的用天線長不不到一时，所用電力小至和普通手電筒所用一般，收發兩方，各裝有抛物線形的反射鏡，於無阻礙物拍隔之兩地間，通報通話巳屬可能。但如何能使此種電波穿透阻礙物，如山丘建築物，等則尙待研究。</p>
<p>近年以内，超短波的研究，巳大有進步，馬可尼更是研究超短波的著名者。前刋本刋内外消息，已有介紹，可請參看，如超短波而能實用於各地通信，則旣可節省電力，又可限制消息的四佈（因其爲單方向之故）無線電界又將起一種革命矣。</p>
<p>五公尺至七公尺之超短波發報收受尙非困難，但距雖不遠。其方式容將來再行介紹，現在只乘發明家馬可尼的來華之際，略述所謂超短波的名稱性質，及反射天線的原理。以見近來無線電界新研究之一斑。希望國内無線電同志亦能奮起直追而已。</p>

<p>— 葉德燦</p>
<p>這一張線路，錄自美國日用機械雜誌上。經試騐之結果，音量很是響大，８</p>
<p>選擇性尤覺靈敏，較本刋第三十九期上純銅君所介紹的一隻優良的礦石機，或更優良，亦未可知。而於製造上很是便利，初步研究者能照製一隻，則欲改成一燈機時，所有另件，除礦石外（來復式收音機例外），均可應用。</p>
<p>所用零件也十分簡單。線圈Ｌ用二十六號漆包線繞在直徑一时半的膠管上（以便改裝一燈機時可增加牠的收音能力）或紙管上繞九十四轉。L1L2用三十二號漆包線，繞於同一膠管上，牠的直徑一时又四分之一。Ｌ１一百零七轉，Ｌ２十七轉：兩線圈相距四分之一时。Ｃ可用·０００５Ｍfd，Ｃ１是·０００３５Ｍfd，Ｃ２用·００２Ｍfd。</p>

<h3 id="c213">（二十一）眞空管收音機（一） <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 黃鑑村</p>
<p>（一）眞空管收音機之分類：眞空管收音機之種類，爲數甚多，觀目下市面所出售者有所謂［幾燈機］［某某式］等，屈指一計其數，雖不下數十種，但若由其供給電源之不同而分類之，則不外乎［直流式收音機］與［交流式收音機］兩大類８</p>
<p>而巳。所謂［直流式］者，其供給電源係利用乾電池或蓄電池者，而［交流之式］之供給電源則是來自電燈之交流電源者。當廣播無綫電方萌芽之時，所有眞空管收音機，都是直流式。嗣後因感覺到直流式之種種不便，例如Ａ電池充電麻煩，Ｂ電池消耗過大等，於是孜孜研究，終於發明了交流式收音機。交流式一出，前此之直流式幾盡被淘汰。在都市方面，直流式者僅限於携帶用或特殊的移動用（如火車内，汽車内之收音機）而巳。</p>
<p>在直流式與交流式兩大類收音機中，又有種種區别。最簡單的是由於眞空管燈數的分類，如稱三燈式收音機，五燈式收音機等，餘此類推。此種分類法雖極簡單，但在同一種三燈機亦有種種方式，亦有優劣得失與機能之差異，故由於燈數之分類法頗　得其要領。如欲最適當的表明眞空管收音機的種類，勢非一方面記明眞空管燈數，同詩又非註明某某方式不可。</p>
<p>由於眞空管燈數的分類中，有一事須注意的，就是在同一機上，交流式收音機要較直流式收音機多裝一燈，那就是整流眞空管，所以使電燈線上的交流電變成直流電的。</p>

<p>— 余揚靈</p>
<p>阿志巴綏夫在給一個友人的信上說：</p>
<p>［這裏的人常常以爲尼采對於我有很大的影響。這使我很驚奇，最簡單的理　　由便是我並不曾讀過尼采，我對於這個顯赫的思想家不表同情，一半在他的　　思想，一半在他作品的浮誇的外表。我一開始讀他的書便不再讀下去。］</p>
<p>據有些文學批評家的意見，高爾基所著的關於漂泊者生活的若干小說，似受有尼采學說的影響。但據高爾基自己說，比他後來所讀的好幾本關於尼采學說的書影響更大的，乃是一個警察，丨名呌Nikiforych丨的一番談話。當時俄國警察，是最普遍的被人痛恨和賤視的，但是這個，尼基福立區在談話中居然有好些地方和那德國哲學者的意見不謀而合。</p>
<p>一個厭棄尼采的作家，一個未必知道尼采的姓氏的警察，在他們的作品和談話中都被人看出尼采的影響，這好像是不可解的。但求解也不難，只須看一看這些人的别方面的共通點。</p>
<p>高爾基是一個不折不扣的Vadabond，不消說得，一個帝俄時代的警察是怎様一種生活的産兒，也不難想像。阿志巴綏夫，則自幼就從母親接受了肺結核的遺産而且貧窮，［住在齷齪的頂閣上，没有充足的食物。］至於尼采，他曾入過軍籍，也曾以孱弱之身，踪跡不定地在飄泊，和高爾基的大學一様，他的［文化博物館］是整個的歐洲。</p>
<p>意識畢竟是存在的産物，有怎様的生活，然後有怎様的思想，有怎様的學說。有相同的生活，便會産生相同的思想。由此觀之，高爾基，阿志巴綏夫，尼基福立區等的一部分思想能與尼采暗合，也是當然之事了。</p>
<p>古書難讀，哲學書更難讀；尼采的哲學書尤爲難讀。有人倘欲理解尼采而去讀［查核圖斯特拉如是說］等書，實在是一件艱苦的笨事。高爾基說，他在書本裏所着到的觀念，很少不是他在實際生活中所已經聽到的。但書本上的智識究竟是紙上空談，遠不如實際生活中所觀察所經騐的事物。富於眞確活躍的特質。</p>
<h3 id="c215">怎様研究［美術史］？ <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 唐雋</p>
<p>一般讀西洋美術史的人，不是覺得［率然寡味］，便是感到［如走泥路］！除了一些留心文藝的人外，研究美術史的，要算美術學校的學生爲最多了。這些研究美術史的學生，大都逃脫不了上述兩個厄運。十年前，作者曾在上海美專，見到一般學生聽着上［美術史］課便覺頭痛，或在聽講時打起瞌睡來。這在藝術運動的行程裏，是一件萬分不幸的事　　然而這種厄運，不是偶然來的，却有種種前因後果在着。</p>
<p>［美術］是一種專門的學科。［美術史］更是專門的專門。我們要研究［美術史］，非先有一種凖備不可。如：（一）羅輯的槪念，（二）美的胎意，（三）純理的批判，（四）古物學和人類學的知識，（五）有親接藝術口的機會等等；都是研究美術史的人應得先行具備的。</p>
<p>關於第一點丨丨羅輯的槪念，我們須得要有哲學與科學的［理解力］和［系統觀念］。至少對於這兩種學問要涉獵過一個大槪。</p>
<p>關於第二點丨丨美的胎意，這是屬於美學的範圍，卽是研究焉洋美術史的人，至少關於美的認識，以及美的原理，要明瞭一個大槪。</p>
<p>關於第三點丨丨純理的批判，卽是說研究美術史的人，自心要有一種理性的確定，來作其藝術批評的根據。</p>
<p>關於第四點丨丨古物學和人類學是歷史學的基礎。美術史當然也不能例外。因爲要尋求一個藝術痕跡的宗系，這些學科都是帮助他的必要知識。</p>
<p>關於第五點丨丨有親接藝術品的機會，這便是要研究美術史的人，能住在一個藝術環境裏有美術館，展覽會裏面實體的藝術品，供其閱覽和參考。</p>
<p>以上種種，在西歐早巳不成問題，而在中國，却是問題重重！</p>
<p>第一，關於美的理論，是很少人研究的。而且是很少人誠心研究的。所謂［美學］等理論低科，實在是中國社會商塲裏最難銷售的一種［冷僻貨］。所以在中國，美術史家的［美意識］是極難養成的。</p>
<p>其次，便是中國没有藝術環境如［美術館］，［名人藝術展覽會］等。更没有多量充實［美術館］和［美術展覽會］等的［作品］，來供給美術史家以一種研究和考證。</p>
<p>這些研究美術史之重要的條件，在中國旣不具備；或粗淺的具備。而不完全，實是研究美術史的人底一種最不幸的遭遇。</p>
<p>爲要衝破這個遭遇，使近代的中國人研究美術史比較的容易，比較的有興趣，那末，除了作上述種種凖備以外，而講授美術史或編纂美術史的方法，也須加意選擇。</p>
<p>講授美術史或編纂美術史的人最要注意的：</p>
<p>（一）藝術在這時代與那時代的相互關係。</p>
<p>（二）藝術成形的前因後果，及其發展的狀况。</p>
<p>（三）各時代，各地方藝術的特色。</p>
<p>（四）藝術的權力與人類的關係。</p>
<p>（五）在藝術發展的過程上尋求［美意識］的究竟。</p>
<p>（六）借美的理論評定某種藝術或某時代的某地方藝術的價値。</p>
<p>（七）借藝術品的實體，來闡明美學上的原理。</p>
<p>以上種種，是我對於講授和編纂美術史的人至少限度的要求。</p>
<h3 id="c216">鏡波湖上 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>是傍晚的時候，斷斷續續地落着六月濛濛的細雨，全個鏡波湖上，就讓一重雨霧蒙住了。</p>
<p>這様的雨，才是悶人，而對於王老頭子，更其是一件憾事：黃花魚要天朗氣表的日子，才願意往水面上游划，現在，都沉到湖水的底下去了。</p>
<p>捕魚的工作，看來不能再繼續了，他一面划着小船，一面把下在湖裏的［絲掛］收起，都收完了，看看簍子裏的魚還汉有滿到一半。大半天的工夫，只是捕到這麽少的魚，一種說不出口的悲哀，透入他内心的深處，隨卽嘆了一口氣：</p>
<p>［唉！這勾當，怕也不是咱幹的了。］</p>
<p>而在他的實地經騐中，近年以來，尤其是近日以來，魚就像没有從前那様的多。他不明白這是什麽道理。</p>
<p>帶着一副失望感傷的心情，他划着小船，穿過湖邊上的柳林，讓細雨悄悄地敲打着他的　衣，一直往東南角上划着，漿划着湖水，花花地響，還不住翻出一些白沫。他要回家了他的家就住在東南湖邊的地面上，那裏正有一個老伴在等候他吃晚飯。</p>
<p>想到吃晚飯，他就知道今晚是不會有什麽看得過眼的東西秘的，這幾天的魚，賣不出，運不出，南湖頭，北湖頭，石頭甸子附近幾個市鎭，魚市上全賣不出去，那裏的人，全在亂七八糟地往外處逃難，聽說寗安同敦化兩方面，日本兵同義勇軍打的正起勁，這兩地中間的鏡波湖一帶，是難免要遭到戰禍的。　　然而王老頭兒並不因此顯得慌張，幾年來他把戰爭看得很平常，年年夏天兵匪間一定要在湖的附近打上幾仗的，可是都没有把他王老頭兒怎麽様過，一直到現在他還是作着漁人，靠打漁同老伴兩個人生活着。</p>
<p>湖上的水面，這時候更被霧氣濃重地罩着，王老頭兒眼睛看到的範圍，只是身邊一個小小的圈子，但他早就熟悉了路徑，就是在大黑天閉着眼睛也還是可以划到家裏去的。</p>
<p>打對面划過好幾隻船，迷蒙中他看到船上裝着滿滿的東西，還擠着一些人，人們彷彿帶有慌張的神氣，等他想仔細看一看是些什麽人的時候，那些船早已划過他的旁邊衝入濃重的霧氣中去了。恰在同時，他似乎聽到了兩聲［咚］［咚］的巨響，他楞了，想：</p>
<p>［是放砲聲？那麽仗打過來了？］</p>
<p>他活了這五十多年，當眞没有聽過放砲的聲音，但在他的意識裏，猜想到只有砲響才能有這麽大的聲音，他想到家裏還有個孤身的老伴，就加緊地划着船，趕程回家好看看她怎麽様了。</p>
<p>［王老伯伯，快跑罷，日本兵打過來了。］</p>
<p>猛然地他聽到熟習的喊聲，是從湖面上喊出來的，但他一時又猜不出是哪一個；往四外一看，是近傍划過去的一隻船上張六子喊他，那麽地忙碌，連下句話都不待說出口就又划到濃霧中去了，留給他的只是雜亂的漿聲。</p>
<p>這意外的變故，出乎他的預料到底來到了，而且還像是很嚴重，他明白先一會湖上面划過去幾船載貨擠人的小船是逃難的了。那麽他自己該怎麽辦呢？他有主意。</p>
<p>［甚甚値錢東西没有，怕什麽！］</p>
<p>這様决定着，他依然往前划着船，只是覺得船划的太慢了，划到凸坎地方，他遇見了他的老伴，她是在坎上大聲地呌着。才能使他衝破霧氣按她到船上。家裏的房子燒完了，日本兵說是怕以後窩藏義勇軍。他聽了老伴述說的話，呆了，什麽主意都没有了，只能划着船往相反的方面衝去。好像那様就可以找到歸宿似的。</p>

<p>— 子展</p>
<p>秦肉六國啖神州，六國之士皆秦　，憶爲顧炎武之［秦皇行］起句。鄙意士之　秦者，何止六國？雖謂秦爲自併六國以來士人之公敵可也。詛秦之文，至今猶常誦在人口者，以賈生之過秦論，杜牧之阿房宮賦爲尤章章。予幼時亦讀此兩文成誦。嘗作詠史詩，其中一絶云：</p>
<p>偶語何妨試一回？</p>
<p>相逢圯上覇圖開。</p>
<p>祖龍鞭石亦流血，</p>
<p>黃石姑爲挾恨來！</p>
<p>師友旣稱之，顧不甚自詡，具稿而已。稍長，讀書略多，始知前人詠及秦皇事者，佳構不少，余最受三絶句，一爲章碣之詠焚書坑：</p>
<p>竹帛烟銷帝業虛，</p>
<p>關河空鎖祖龍居。</p>
<p>坑灰未冷山東亂，</p>
<p>劉項原來不讀書！</p>
<p>一爲陳孚之詠博浪沙：</p>
<p>一擊車中膽氣豪，</p>
<p>祖龍社稷已驚搖。</p>
<p>如何十二金人外，</p>
<p>猶有人間鐵未消！</p>
<p>一爲陳恭尹之讀秦紀：</p>
<p>謗聲易弭怨難除，</p>
<p>秦法雖嚴亦甚疎。</p>
<p>夜半橋邊呼孺子，</p>
<p>人間猶有未燒書！</p>
<p>此詩［人間猶有未燒書］，與前詩［猶有人間鐵未消］，意似相襲，而不嫌其襲者，以一詠焚書，一詠銷燬兵器也。北洋軍人某公，亦頗能詩，其詠焚書一絶云：</p>
<p>稷下羣言孰折衷？</p>
<p>祖龍一炬燭天紅！</p>
<p>焚書若果論功罪，</p>
<p>也値删書一半功。</p>
<p>此詩頗爲焚書一事翻案，祖龍復活，當必龍顔大悅。其於此等文人亦當以李斯之例相待，活理之坑，豈爲若輩而設？孰謂暴秦之世，凡儒皆坑也乎？</p>

<p>［假如可能的話，我是很願意乘着這隻郵船出發的。］</p>
<p>哲安問他道：</p>
<p>［你爲什麽不能呢？］</p>
<p>［因爲在航行大西洋的郵船公司裏我不認識任何人。］</p>
<p>羅蘭很吃驚的問道：</p>
<p>［而你那一切偉大的成功的計劃呢？你都抛棄了嗎？］</p>
<p>筆爾低低地說道：</p>
<p>［有時候我們是必須知道犧牲一切，把最好的希望也抛棄的。並且，這不過是一個起始罷了，這是一個掙得幾吉佛郎以備隨後自己開業的乎段。］</p>
<p>他的父親立刻被他的話說服了：</p>
<p>［這話很對。在兩年裏面你便可以儲蓄六千或七千佛郎，這筆錢如果用得好的話，你的前程是未可限量的。你覺得怎様，路易茲？］</p>
<p>她以一種低微的，差不多聽不清楚的聲音回答：</p>
<p>［我覺得筆爾的話有道理。］</p>
<p>羅蘭呌道：</p>
<p>［但我去把這事和普南先生說說，我和他很熟！他是商業裁判所的法官，並且他担任着船公司的事情。我還有船主勒仰先生，他和一位副董事長很要好。］</p>
<p>哲安問他的哥哥道：</p>
<p>［我今天就去和瑪尙先生探探口氣看，好嗎？］</p>
<p>［好的。］</p>
<p>筆爾想了一下又說道：</p>
<p>［最好的辦法恐怕還是寫封信給醫科大學的我那幾位先生，他們都很器重我。到這種船上去做醫生的常是一些平凡脚色。由瑪斯洛賽爾，勒繆佐，弗拉施，波立格爾諸位敎授寫封熱烈的介紹信，一定比一切靠不住的請託都穩妥快捷。這事祇要你的朋友瑪尙先生把這信提出董事會就行了。］</p>
<p>哲安完全表示贊成：</p>
<p>［你的主意好極了，好極了！］</p>
<p>於是他微笑着，安心了，因爲確信這事會成功，還差不多感着滿足，他是不能長久憂悶的。</p>
<p>［你今天就寫信給他們嗎？］他說。</p>
<p>［一會就寫，卽刻就寫。我現在就去寫。我今天早上不要喝咖啡，我是太過神經質的。］</p>

<p>— 南海沙鷗</p>
<p>失業的痛苦，與求生的競爭，本來是無間中外古今，永恒地在那裏推演著。尤其是相伴於現代的物質的享樂尖銳化的形勢之中，種種的矛盾，各走極端；那種競爭和不上軌道的亂動，便愈加激烈化了。</p>
<p>得志的人，在都市裏，在峯頂上，在象牙宮内，在溫柔鄕中，儘量享受著　　的懀樂的天堂的生活。不得志的人，永恒地陷在潦倒困窮的下層社會的遭際。</p>
<p>於是提著槍桿的人，因物質上的企求，便利用失業無告的農民做，他豹　虎帳的護符，踐踏著積　的將卒的白骨以攀上天堂。拿著七寸毛錐的文裝同志，依附了武裝同志的旌旄，搭住馬脚，高呼著［解放民衆］的口號，相隨著彈冠進宮。</p>
<p>及至登堂入室之後，以天堂裏面仙尊的擁擠，脚跟一鬆，掉落天外。慒然一夢醒回，眼看著凡間的枯寂，乾燥和窘困，回味著天堂生活的赫煊與舒適，蠢蠢思動的情火，時刻不能去懷，終於伸出猿臂，翻著觔斗，駕起祥雲，再來一個！</p>
<p>爲了這些一刹那一刹那的像煞有介事，各種花様便波浪似地没有靜止的翻騰著。</p>

<p>— 春柳</p>
<p>在戴季陶自作的［余之讀書記］上，我們可以約略知道他的童年生活　　戴季陶，不成問題的是吳興人，但他是生長在四川廣漢縣的。幼年時家道很清寒，六歲喪祖父，他父親因爲祖父遺留下來的糾紛，和人涉訟，被覊於本州禮房者凡二年，季陶也隨侍在押。那時他才十一歲，讀書很刻苦，天分又高，竟將文獻通考及方輿紀要序那様的煌煌巨籍，也列爲古文課程。十三歲時遭父喪。他哥哥命他進成都的東游預備學校，准備將日文學好，卽赴日留學。十四歲時，轉入成都客籍學堂，復因鬧學潮被革。十五歲時，乃以日人小亞三七之介紹，在一家中學裏當日文譒譯。他的哥哥見他很可造就，便賣了家裏的三十畝沙田，得七百塊錢，給他做留日學費，那時他的祖母還在着，堅决地不許他遠行，結果是弟兄們串好了讓他偷跑的。</p>
<p>他在日本留學四年，十九歲便回國，在蘇州一個專門學校裏敎書。後來以洪佛矢先生的介紹，入天鐸報任總編輯，是他記者生活的開始，那時已二十一歲了。</p>

<p>— 碧翁</p>
<p>在上海南京路中心點，饒有悠久歷史的一個去處，呌做［日昇樓］，提起此名，眞是婦稚皆知；可是這家甚囂塵上的日昇樓茶館，不知怎的，在前年搖身一變，變了［方壺酒廬］，不久又變了［南越酒家］；好在茶餘酒後，這都是魯衛之政，也不要向它去尋根究蒂。　　整個世界的不景氣，也使我們最繁盛的南京路，受了影響，大减價的旗幟是司空見慣了，而大拍賣的把戲，也層出不窮，常常見到的某華綢肆，什麽［出清大拍賣］？什麽［某地九廠委託大傾銷］？什麽［股東意見不合，實行大犧牲？］種種不倫不類的告白，天天在變花様，識者都暗自匿笑着；但是他們簡直苦不勝言呀！房租這麽貴，職員又裁無可裁，開支是要的，擱在櫉窗裏的貨物，不能當金元化，不這様想出動人的標語，誰肯站住脚呢。</p>
<p>任何一個電車站上，都有伸着手討銅子的化子們，在那裏値班；但是他們在背地裏，都在擦了洋火吸香烟，咳！香烟不是飯，他們都省不掉，這一輩乞兒，簡直是可憐不足惜；有時鬧動了捕房偵探，駛來一輛大囚車，將他們大大小小男男女女，不分靑紅皂白，一起捉了進去，那時倘使稍微倔强一下，五枝雪茄賞來，比香烟的味兒，似乎更優勝，這一個問題，我却不能下斷語。</p>
<p>常見外國影片裏，形容中國小兒，往往很熟練的在那兒玩三把小刀，或上或下，雙手接三刃，靈活得很；這便是小乞丐向洋人討錢的把戲；洋人深印在腦筋裏，便代表中華兒童的玩藝了；這够多麽恥辱而偏見的一回事啊！說起洋人的固執，和不能隨時了解中華的時代進展，到處可以見到的，像工部局在電車或電杆上，最近所貼的警告華童速速種痘的繪畫；兒童的衣帽裝束，簡直還在民國以前；還有耶誕禮物裏的賀年片，上面印的我華男女同胞的服裝，也和時代隔離了至少相差十年。</p>

<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>報紙固以新聞爲中心，然也離不開廣告。所以我們買了一種報紙，除掉讀新聞而外，還可以看那五花八門的廣告；並且論不定從廣告中，我們還可買著便宜貨，或甚至發著意想不到的橫財。至新聞與廣告何者爲人所愛閱，雖似不易斷定：然亦有軌跡可尋。簡言之，國家在承平之世，報紙上廣告恒多於新聞；反之，則新聞總多於廣告。是故一國國運的盛衰隆替，不難循此軌跡以求之。這是我讀了數十年報紙的心得如果要舉例來說，可略述如左：</p>
<p>辛亥那年，武昌起義。各報盈篇累幅，都競登著某省獨立，某某反正的消息，使人讀之，眉飛色舞。是以關心國事的人們，一得著報紙，莫不欲爭覩新聞而後快。至於廣告，除了［洋錢行情］爲關心金融的人所値得注意外，其餘的，８</p>
<p>在那時不能不讓新聞獨出風頭了。</p>
<p>還有，［一二八］事變發生那年，我剛被困在某後方某地。有一天，走到靑年會，看見萬頭攢動在一處，有的口中還在喃喃着。原來墻壁上黏着一張滬報，這報是從前綫帶回來的。那時，人人關心前方的消息；我想報上縱登着炫人心８</p>
<p>目的廣告，恐也没有人注意及之了。</p>
<p>從上述二例，可以證明在國家有事的時候，人民都重視新聞而忽略廣告的。反過來說，報上新聞的領域，逐漸被廣告占了去，這或者就是天下太平的預兆。所以我們對之，旣不必興［嘸啥看頭］之歎，亦不必抱［杞人憂天］之心，落得多看看廣告，遇着有心愛的東西，不管吃的用的，不妨多買些。要知人生幾何，何必自苦？明乎此，方配看報紙，方配看報紙的上廣告。</p>

<p>桂枝睡在床上聽着，實在忍無可忍了，一個翻身坐了起來，將半仔蓬散的頭髮，偏到臉腮上，板着臉道：瞧你這位老人家，話越說越難聽，我作了什麽見不得人的事情！不成得啦，你也别多嚷，從明天起，我决計不出大門一步。我要走出了大門，我這一輩子，就得不着好死。那坑頭邊正有幾隻花露水瓶雪花膏罐子之類。桂枝順手掏起一隻，就向地上一砸又是拍咤一下嚮。指着地上道：我若是心口不如一的話，就像這瓶子一様。江氏以爲閨女受了敎訓，心中頗爲自得，自己有一肚子蘊藏待洩的話，正想傾筐倒匣的，趁着今天這個機會，完全說了出來。出其不意的，却不料姑娘這様的猛烈反抗一下，倒鬧的他停止了不說是不好，跟着往下說也是不好。於是也紅了臉，站起來望着桂枝道：你這是什麽意思呢？自己一出門子，也就是快做大人的人了，對着你的上人，就能够這様子蠻不講理嗎？將來自己上了歲數了，你的下人，把這副様子來對你，你是受得了不受了呢？桂枝道：我並没有說你的話說得不好呀。８</p>
<p>我因爲你的話說的是對的，又怕你不放心我，所以我把這個香水瓶子砸了，好看出來我說這話，是下了决心的。江氏站在燈下，氣的臉上是紅一陣白一陣，但是姑娘旣發了脾氣，若是跟着向下去說他，也怕他嚷了起來，更是不方便。兩手反到身後去撑住了桌子，冷笑一聲道：你瞧這半頭兒不是反了。桂枝微搖着頭道：一點兒也不反，我這說的是實話。江氏見姑娘的態度，還是這様的倔强，本待再向下跟着說上兩句。却聽到後面院子裏，趙翁連連的咳嗽了幾聲。（二八四）</p>

<p>情雖與前市相似、但人心看好、市面活潑、瑞有大帮與整囤收買、市價卽可上展也、昨全日成交蕪湖元米二百九十六包、價七元六角八分、江西機早二百十八包、價六元○九分、湖南機油一百包、價七元三角半、又機紅米三百包、價六元七角、又機靖一百包、價七元、中次照降、其中機靖爲泉州帮辦去外、統由本街收進云、</p>

<p>昨日黃豆來源不湧、市形平穩、全市成交車輪８</p>
<p>各豆十一二車、計開正陽關豆三車、價三元五角８</p>
<p>半至四角八、肥河豆一車、價亦開三元四角八、穎州豆二車、價三元四角半及四角二、碭山豆一車、價三元四角、以上除正陽關豆出口及本街分去二車外、餘統由内地車坊辦取、尙有毫州豆一車、價做三元二角三、高耿豆二車價爲三元三角８</p>
<p>半及三角三、蚌埠豆二車、價扯三元二角、係本街之胃、廠方不動、沙黃有甬帮動辦、市態見平杜豆成交寥落、市少變化云、</p>

<p>昨日糖市、以標金復跌、而荷匯略長、趨勢仍疲、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨劃十九元二角８</p>
<p>半、比前日又小五分、八九號荷赤普通劃十五元８</p>
<p>四角、比前日小一角、太古糖小四分、Ｂ嘜爲二十元零零四分、ＣＷ嘜爲十九元九角、本廠綿白再小一角、振記一號爲十八元三角、二號一角、三號十七元九角、四號七角、國産潮靑市勢稍定、昨開降港靑二百餘包、價爲十二元至十一元九８</p>
<p>角、片靑在去年尾曾開九元六角、封關期後、高莊潮靑跌三四角於前、此種下檔貨當然難望立定、故昨市猛跌六角、由廣帮號家開出三百餘件、價爲九元、</p>

<p>厦門生曬圓肉、　來到貨雖稀、但爲别種圓肉頻跌所致、原價竟難立定、昨聞號盤稍有開出、較之前價又小三四元、行盤因亦隨鬆、同時碼元肉亦小一二元、貨客均遭虧耗云、</p>

<p>▲海外絲　仍無轉機</p>
<p>（絲繭交易所積極　組）獻美絲銷疲滯、我國絲、業勢將全部崩潰、江浙兩屬絲廠同業公會於上年底在滬開聯席會議、决定籌組絲繭交易所、以謀挽救、昨晤上海市絲廠同業公會主席沈驊臣君、稱絲繭交易所一事、現經大會推定與周乾初起草章程、陳則忠張韻笙陳炳若等審查、預定資本二十五萬元、一俟起草完竣、再行開會提出討論、並進行籌備、呈報實業部備案云、觀此則開辦之期、當亦不遠矣、</p>
<p>（絲頭百餘件運往孟買）此次大英郵船本格船兩號出口、安利等共有長吐繭衣等一百二十五件、裝往孟買云、</p>
<p>（人造絲期貨春銷漸起）獻歲以來、内地各客帮對於人造絲期貨進胃漸起、昨由烟脅等帮進金麒麟黑美女飛象等片一·二月份百磅箱、期貨三十四箱、價自一百九十八元二角半至一百八十四元七角半凈盤、（八十號至二百號貨）、</p>
<p>（粗絲印銷仍趨平疲）海外生絲市塲、新歲開市後、綢門進胃仍呆、囤戶手中存絲尙充、紐約日絲開價難漲、里昻實銷未起、價仍下游、歐美絲銷仍乏轉機、滬埠市氣依然疲靜、絲電亦鮮發出、昨祇印莊進黃白絲經十一包、紅盤價仍平疲、</p>

<h3 id="c261">今年的婦女和兒童 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>因爲今年是［婦女國貨年］和［兒童年］，所以一向被若干衛道之士加以蔑視的［婦女］和許多人加以無視的［兒童］竟都［爬上了時代的高峯］，成爲人們所常加齒及或筆及的對象了。</p>
<p>平情而論，誰敢說婦女不應該服用國貨？誰又說兒童的幸福不應加以重視？然而在咱們這複雜動亂，漂亮議論往往被事實摑以［雪茄］的貴國，却都是［大成問題］！</p>
<p>先說婦女與國貨罷：［愛國志士］們拿［國貨救國］來代替［抗日］，已是兩年於茲。但在實際情形中，我們還是只看到民族工業的［與日俱衰］，看到日貨入口的排山倒海，看到許多奸商們之［生財有道］。這鐵一様的事實，足够證明中國社會的富裕逐利之層，早已是其心已死，其血已凉。奸商之羣的［人生哲學］，簡直是［祖墳不妨一掘，日貨不能不賣］！所以，去年鬧得很有勁的［國貨年］，結果是並不［佳妙］。現在，又把［男女平等］的［國貨年］打一對拆，成爲［婦女國貨年］然則未來的結果又將何如？唉！我說穿了，未免［敗人清興］，我不說，又有些［如鯁在喉］！第一，洋大人的生活日用品尤其是奢侈品，是旣貴且［好］，早已成爲中國上層社會，以享樂淫逸爲原則的婦女們［不可須臾離］的［生活素］！現在要提倡［婦女國貨年］，在事實上那些貴婦名媛們，是必然要［除外］，不能上算的。第二，因爲洋貨之物美價廉的傾銷，和國貨之關卡如林的剥削，中下社會的日用品，實在是國貨大半較洋貨爲貴，於是，要十九破産，購買力微弱到極點的窮苦婦女來爲着多她們並不很了了的［愛國］來［非用國貨不可］，又似乎在事實上做不通。結果，［婦女國貨年］勢不能不截頭去脚，以略有知識，買得起國貨的一部分小資産階級婦女爲對象，所以，從［婦女國貨年］所創造出來的［民族實業家］，恐怕並不怎様多罷？同時，本屐貨入口激增的數字，也不見得會因［婦女國貨年］的呼聲震耳而略有减少罷？然而然始終是希望我這一推測是［錯誤］的！</p>
<p>其次，再說［兒童年］：現在，正是凡百破産，多數人墮餓鬼道的災難時代，四萬萬人之中，至少有三萬五千萬人的子女，陷於衣食不足，餓飯，檢垃圾，拉黃包車，當婢妾娼妓的地獄生活之中。所以，中國的兒童，在事實上有一大半成爲［凖呌化］，這些兒童的［利益］，除了使中國政治民生有出路，是絶不會有保障的。現在，我以爲熱心［慈幼］的志士仁人們，最實際的任務不是在怎様高唱［兒童年］，而是多辦幾個平民日夜校，禁止對兒童的虐殺和買賣，爲失學餓飯的不幸兒童找一點［杯水車薪］的救濟。能够做到這些，就已經是［公侯萬代］的大陰騭了，誰還敢奢望甚望［兒童年］！至於那些用大洋計算，陳列於各大公司的［兒童樂園］和兒童之［科學化］的衣食住行，都不過是爲有錢人們的［小寳寳］多尋一點開心的材料。其實，這些［寳寳］們早已被他們的父母們恨不得啣在口裏，就是不提倡［兒童年］，他們已是幸福到［特等第一］那裏會用得着志士仁人們像煞有介事的大吹大擂！</p>
<p>我所見到的［婦女國貨年］和［兒童年］不過是［那麽一回事］而已！</p>
<h3 id="c262">旱橋心影 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 老牌</p>
<p>曾經有過四個足月，我每日凖時的要跨過這旱橋兩趟。</p>
<p>討飯吃的職差的名望倒還不差，可是薪給却低得使人害羞，而且機關又設立在那麽最豪富的地段，在那附近要想解决吃食和住宿，簡直是不可能的事，事實逼迫着我，只有遠遠的寄居在滬北的一個同鄕家裏，每日凖時的跑去跑回，每日凖時的跨過這旱橋兩趟。</p>
<p>本來是應該跨過四趟的，實實爲的腿子跑得太酸痛了，脚底更起了兩個洋錢大的水泡，這才改變一下，寗願當中把肚皮挨一次餓，省下了兩趟。每早九點鐘光景，用過一頓早不是早，又不是中餐的一頓飯，便出發去辦［動彈不得］的公。許要跑上半小時的髒馬路，才抵達旱橋的橋堍，這却天然有一個［少憇］的機會，呵，過橋的入是那麽擁擠呵！　　暖熱的太陽慢慢的從東邊高陞上來，呌起了滬北的連連疊疊的貧民窟裏的苦力，車夫哪，小工哪，小販哪，形形色色的其他的苦力哪，肩負着各種的工具，集合在通達橋堍的幾條窄馬路上，一層一層的緊近去，到了相近橋堍的一段，就成了［臀貼臀，頭碰頭］的形勢。時間來不及了的時候，我也就是這形勢中之一員，人旣擠得這麽厲害，就各個都想趕先擠過去，然而事實却偏偏不允許你，那麽烘亂一會兒，首先是演習一串［國駡］，江北人的［媽媽的］［狗Ｘ的］，山東塊的［Ｘ你娘的Ｘ］廣東老的［Ｘ倷媽］，湖南人的［娘賣Ｘ的］，湖北夥計的［Ｘ你的妹妹］；再兇一點，就有從橋上一個個的人滾下橋堍來，於是［駡］就斬然停止了，只見揮拳聲，足踢聲，亂得如沸如烟，交通無形斷絶了，反而大家都無法跨過去了。</p>
<p>遇到這様的塲合，我就只有避路，兜了一個大圈子，從火車站那面繞過去，還隱隱地望得見是那麽亂，彷彿是世仇似的，没有寗息的止境。</p>
<p>然而這也並不是每天如此的，有幾天大家也格外的客氣，幾乎到了［動武］的形勢，却畢竟意外的和平通過了。那就有兩句刻板的話，在各個的嘴邊一　一閉的掉出來，那便是：［大家是自家人，馬馬虎虎吧！］擠亂的人就都是這種擠亂的音響裏一個個的踱了過去。</p>
<p>是某一天了，我去得遲些，跨上橋頂，只見一羣小販拖鼻哭臉的在檢拾踏得凌亂不堪的什物，我問他們爲的是什麽，是不是被警察老爺踢翻的，他們說：［不是的，這時候警察不來的，本來我們很可自由的在這橋上有行販，却碰着一羣過橋的人，爲了搶前，大打一架，把我們的傢私都打翻了，人就各個的逃散了。］［呵，原來如此，今早又出過一次亂子呵！］這印象是永遠使我不會忘記！每早經過那兒，除了爲自己起戒心，更爲那些小販躭心不輕。</p>
<p>夜，深夜十點鐘光景，我又帶着疲乏而又飢餓的身體跨過這旱橋。然而這時是寗靜得多了，爲的也是自己急於要趕回去用飯，很少注意到身邊的形色。在凄清的電炬下，一切呈現着黯淡的陰森，恐慌，橋頂上間或還一二個小販在欲斷欲續的喚賣，多着的是赤脚瞎眼以及一切的討吃同胞，正在安排他們的睡</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>具，挨著兩旁，連疊的安排下去。還有，是總有那么閑逸的二三位同胞，衣冠楚楚的倚靠著橋沿，在切切私語，彷彿是肩負有某種使命似的，正在期待著什么，那恐怕就是上海的黑夜君子吧，我想。</p>
<p>我很注意的，跨過這旱橋的很少有西裝客，更少摩登女郎。然而它給我的印象很深，它與我的關係很切！怱怱我已是一年來不曾跨過了，但它永遠的永遠的刻畫在我的心頭。</p>
<h3 id="c263">報紙與教科書 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 曲辰</p>
<p>知道報紙是一種教科書，這是我近來的一大進步。</p>
<p>過去我總迷信著報紙是代表輿論，與報告新聞的，現在才知道並不然。有些新聞，倒是為了要報告才產生的。而所謂輿論也者······招牌雖然是這一塊，但看起來總未免帶有點無聊</p>
<p>記得過去曾在某一部笑話書裹（大概是石天基的笑得好）看到一則呆子讀書，細看三天之後，然後知書本上的字是印板的，而不是寫的。當時曾為之一笑。不料我看了十多年的報紙，直到今天才知道報紙也是一種教科書，於是我深悔當初的一笑，笑得太早了。</p>
<p>現代的報紙，顯分著兩階級：一種是編報的，一種是看報的。編報的顯然是居於教師的地位，而看報的恰如被派定了的小學生，報紙則相當於教師與學生中間的教科書。</p>
<p>教師說：你們應當敬重先生，先生教你怎么做，你就怎么做，不可反抗先生的命令。於是便在教科書上增添了一課。倘真有幾個，不服從先生命令的學生，或是揭了先生短處的呢，那末，教師又說了：不守校規，著記大過一次，於是他又在教科書上又寫下了一課，來給你讀。其實記過盡管記過，而頑皮的學生，總是不肯悛善改過的，但教師在眾人面前總以為甚為得體。否則倘說教師為學生打了，這課書還如何教得下?去？人是這樣地善於為看書想啊！</p>
<p>教科書教人知道他應學得的智識，如學化學的，知道氫二氧一等於水，學報紙的使命所要你們知道的，也是這樣，我不敢說因為教師的不好，我聽的不明白，我總怪自己腦筋太笨，自己不能心領神會罷了，所以讀死書的學生，往往讀成書獃子，而一般聰明的學生他自會舉一反三觸類傍通，不問教員如何，而學生的智識，自會邁進。</p>

<h3 id="c265">一九三三年的***路 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>一九三三年的三百六十五天的日子，已經不知怎樣地打發過去了。趁著新年開始的時機，我們如果把最近過去的三百六十五天來所經歷的事蹟作個總決算，也未始不是沒有意義的事吧。</p>
<p>古人有言道，「國而忘家，公而忘私，」根據了這句古訓，我們自然要把我們的國家大事放在總決算表裹的第一頁，而應當把我們個人的細碎家事按下不提的，於是我就標定了本文的題目為：「一年來的中國」。</p>
<p>題目是標定了，困難卻就發生了：這樣廣泛的題目的大文章，配我這樣小夥子來寫嗎</p>
<p>我於是　　　　的題目　　　一年來的上海。</p>
<p>這個題目，雖說比先前的縮小了許</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>多，不過十里洋塲的形形色色，自非馳騁其中的［才子］們來寫述不能盡其妙：以一天到晚蜷伏一隅的我，要把廣大的上海作一年來縱橫的叙述，這結果只落得一個［坐井觀天］之誚而已。所以，我又不得不重新設法把這個題目改了。</p>
<p>老實說，自從一九三三年的元旦到今天，我不曾有半個月以上的時間離開過上海。除了五十二天的星期，以及偶有的假日，我是天天從寓所到辦事的地方去工作的，早發夜歸，天天過着極端機械的生活。這様，我對於［外界］的隔膜，自然是不免了。比較和我熟悉的只有一條從寓所到辦事處去年必經的ＸＸＸ路。ＸＸＸ路旣是上海社會的一角，我就何妨把這一角的社會相找住做題材呢？於是，本文的題目終於最後定了：［一九三三年的ＸＸＸ路］</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ路是在法租界最西僻一條甚長的馬路，其長度决不亞於公共租界的靜安寺路，所差的，牠没有像靜安寺路那様廣闊熱鬧，不過牠卻比靜安寺路幽靜得多。</p>
<p>這路上的某一點，是一所外國兵駐紥的兵營，兵營的旁邊有着一所靶子塲，一到每天的清晨，靶子塲裏就軋軋地發出了聲音，往往把樹林間的宿烏驚起，而我呢，也頗受這［軋軋］聲的恩賜，不至於失了眠而耽誤我的工作。兵營的門口時常排滿着黃包車，每個車夫都露着［期望］的眼光注視兵營的門口，凡是在那裏進出的［洋兵］，我想没有一個會給他們的目光放過的。</p>
<p>「Hallo『立克寫』？」當一個或一羣高大的穿着制服的洋兵從這口門出來的時候，就有一羣［苦力］拉了車子飛也似奔了過去，像是搶食一様。</p>
<p>有時候，穿制服的人喜歡坐汽車，有時候，他們喜歡步行，［苦力］們於是面面相覷地苦笑着；有時候，穿制服的人一揮手踏上了車子，苦力們就感着恩賜似地飛也似的跑去了；有時候，穿制服的人心中有着過分怒憤或歡喜，就拿［苦力］們的面孔或背脊來敲打一番，以爲發洩，苦力呢？便把露着破絮的袖管東西招架着，臉上卻始終掛着微笑。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ路上有個很大的廣塲，球迷們看見了一定會想到這實在可以做一個足球塲的。可是，現在，那裏卻堆砌着石頭，長滿着靑草：從元旦到除夕，無論是早晨，是夜晚，包你可以見到有三兩的工人或車夫在那裏踴着排泄，往往使摩登的士女望而卻步。日子久了，排泄物積聚起了不少，如果大風一起，就不免［草紙］飛揚，芳香四散。從這裏，我們可以體會到在都市裏生活的勞苦大衆，就是排泄也是一個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>走在ＸＸＸ路上，可以望得見的，丨有一所十分宏偉的狗公館。那裏大槪有着七八十頭的狗，牠們有十幾個的僕人服侍着，牠們吃的是麵包，牠們衣的是錦繡，牠們睡的是厚絨。我們勞動的人們，誰有他們的安適舒服呢？然而，牠們每星期六能够在逸園裏逐着電兎跑，而我們不能，那末，牠們之特别受人優待，自是應當的了。</p>
<p>一九三三年的ＸＸＸ路上，以我所知的只是這些。至於太太的汽車輾人，賣菜婦被打，······等等的瑣事，那是不必記寫而我也記不了這許多。總之，讀者看了上面的零碎事實，是否感到這好像是中國全社會的反映呢？</p>
<h3 id="c266">最會討便宜的民族 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 白匋</p>
<p>［什麽東西到了中國，便都糟糕！］有一位新從外國回來的朋友說，［你看，人家用無綫電來傳遞消息，作公開的學術演講。但到了中國，中國人便用牠來播送灘簧，小曲。弄得滿街滿巷都是些下流的梆子調，眞噪鬧得要命！］</p>
<p>這自然是千眞萬確的。無論什麽好東西，一到中國人手裏可就糟了。就例如說雅片烟吧，外國人用來醫病，但是一到中國，聰明的中國人便把牠裝到烟槍上來吸。這可就糟了，一吸上癮，除非是百萬富翁，否則就非弄到家破人亡不止。</p>
<p>又有人說：中國人只會享受，不會創造。這自然也是千眞萬確的。外國人自造槍砲自己玩。但中國人要從外國人手裏去買現成的。又例如飛機吧。單從美國買來的，可也就不少。美國人把飛機造好了，一船一船的運到中國來。中國人候他到家裏之後，還要候他把一切物件裝配妥當。裝配妥當還不算，還要候他先坐上去玩一遍給自家看看，然後才去接收下來。</p>
<p>再舉一個例，例如汽車。中國人坐汽車的，可眞不少。大家都以坐汽車爲榮。稍微有幾個錢的人，就想買汽車。而况近年來，政府提倡建設公路，舉行航空道路建設會，發行航空道路奬券，全國上下都踴躍輸將。自然，公路一建設起來，就是買不起自備汽車的人，也就可以坐坐長途公共汽車了。反正，大家都有汽車坐了。可是，坐的汽車都是買得人家現成的。中國人根本就不想自造汽車自家坐。</p>
<p>好在，中國人的福氣好，許多外國　小子都在那裏拚命的創造呢！只要我老子有錢，誰個洋小子不來孝敬我！</p>
<p>有一位德國傻小子看得很清楚，也許因爲他在中國居得較長的緣故吧。有一天，他對幾個中國朋友說：［對的，對的，中國人所要的，是人家做現成的東西。中國學校裏，學生所讀的書，也都是人家所研究出來的結果。中國人是世界上最會討人家便宜的民族！］</p>

<h3 id="c268">好萊塢對於一九三四年的展望 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 西復</p>
<p>據好萊塢一般人的推測，好萊塢在本年，將成爲一個熱不可當之年。其最大的原因，就是因爲最熱的熱明星梅蕙絲，在去年巳經得到了空前的勝利，使其他明星們，在這元氣未復的年頭，不得不起而效尤；否則就難以使觀衆們腰包裏的錢唏哩嘩啦地流出來。</p>
<p>不過有一點可注意的事，就是一九三四年銀幕上的［性］將如何表現，這個問題，大家都不敢十二分公開討論。爲什麽？呢，就是恐怕討論得太厲害了，會引起一般道學派檢查員的重視，而發生枝節的。此外復有一種人就是社會改進派的份子。他們以社會的改善爲已任，每逢一張片子裏，有了些不道德］的表演，就會面紅耳赤，　拳擦掌，伸出頭來說話的。但是據說這種人近來亦多銷聲匿跡了，因爲一則社會的與論，和他們的主張衝激得太甚了，他們勢有不敵，就此趁風轉舵了；一則因爲影界的市面，這様不振，不能不有熱的，刺激性的東西來繁榮一下；社會改進派份子爲顧全大局起見，亦就不能過於固執己見了。就是電影檢查會，亦頗能體恤商艱，不作焚琴煮鶴之舉，因此像梅蕙絲的作品，在以前頗少通過希望的，在一九三三年亦居然一一通過了。雖然如此，爲萬全計，當然還是少討論多製作的好。</p>
<p>一九三四非但會比以前的都熱，並且還要添加些裸體畫面。美國的攝製家已經受到了俄國德國片子的影響。再則人心是一年比一年老練，從前看見了以爲新奇的東西，現在看慣了而不以爲奇，一定要另外覓取新奇的畫面了。因上，一九三四年的作品，一定比以前的熱而有趣，對於人體美的表露，亦一定更爲大膽。</p>
<p>在一九三三年裏，梅蕙絲（MayWet）已經開了一個先聲。在一九三四年裏，接踵而起的，據云有以下的幾個明星：柏德凱爾頓（ＰertKelton）金吉露傑絲（GingerRogers）。還有幾位，他們性情本不近於浪漫，但是因爲多才多藝的緣故，也預備在一九三四年中，改變他們的作風，而加入浪漫風騷隊裏去了。他們是海倫漢絲（HelenHayes），凱茀蘭茜絲（KayFrancis），克勞黛考爾白（ＣlaudetteＣolbert）等。他們在去年，已經小試身手，但是竟已得到了意外的收穫。</p>
<p>觀衆們對於影戲，因爲各種原故，漸漸感到厭倦了。梅蕙絲是好萊塢中興的功臣。她一出世，風氣爲之一振。金吉露傑絲從而效之，在PrbessionalSweetheart裏，揙起了一般熱風。柏德凱爾頓變本加厲，在BedofRosses裏，犧牲了色相，博得了一九三四年的太合同。就是溫婉如處女的蒂亞娜溫嬝DianaWynyard，亦不能不秋波送媚，艶情欲滴了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c269">評［靑春之火］ <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨天一出品·卡爾登映丨</p>
<p>（一）關於裘芑香先生，在中國電影中，我們决不可以忽視他的存在。</p>
<p>自［蘭谷萍踪］［追求］而後，以至過去不久開映的［掙扎］，在創作技巧上，我們不難尋出他漸次進步的痕迹。但在作品中所表現出來的意識形態，却令人有些不可捉摸。［蘭谷萍踪］或［追求］，所給與我們認識的是無味的愛的糾紛，至［掙扎］時，似乎是正面的表現出他有了新的傾向。雖然其中仍是忠恕之道的說敎，然而多少總描寫了農民在鄕村中所愛到的疾苦。這使我們懂憬着中國電影前途的光輝。然而人們的心靈到底是神秘得令人不可捉摸啊！</p>
<p>（二）［靑春之火］又是作者編劇兼導演的，這可以看出他自採取題材乃至表現技巧的全部。</p>
<p>作者在［靑春之火］中所取材的人物，都是軍界中的老爺太太以至於小姐少爺。就在這些人羣中間，作者創作了一個Romanlism的浪漫史。</p>
<p>固然，我們不忽視作者暴露了官塲中的醜惡，軍官們中間的裙帶關係，官階爵位，私相授受。這些。都使我們相信這是大胆的筆調。但是，故事的主題，並不在此，相反的，唯一的目的，却是戀愛神聖的結論。因此，我們在［靑春之火］中不能得着相當的滿足，當這戀愛把戲在戲院中已受着觀衆之厭惡的時候。</p>
<p>反對父母之命媒灼之言的婚烟，似乎已成過去了。不管劉督辦爲什麽要將女兒嫁給旅長，不管劉督辦爲什麽要單純爲了寵愛小姐的原故而將旅長升爲師長，而美麗的千金小姐嫁給醜惡的丈夫，究竟是作者十分同情而可憐她的我們看罷，作者没有方法使她超脫丈夫的懐抱，甚至於孟先連［一部份的愛］都不肯給她，於是她只有［爲愛而犧牲］，用手槍結束了自己的生命而死於情人民懐抱之中。死，便是靑春之火的爆發，而所謂純潔的愛便受着作者極大的讚譽！</p>
<p>（四）記得裘先生在答覆訪問者的談話中，他曾經說很爲中國電影作品之美國化而痛心。但是直到如今，直到這［靑春之火］爲止，裘先生自劇本以至於演出，都是模仿美國影片的。因此，美國影片在中國深深的種下基礎，在此又得着一個例證。</p>
<p>（五）如上述，導演的畫面構成，有些地方的確是很純熱。剪接的清順，佈景的恰當，都是特長。而不必要的字幕太多，却又是大毛病。</p>
<p>其中最使我們不滿意的地方，便是有幾個演員的文明戲化，以及噱頭的穿插不通，這是導演應該負責的。然而其中最可取的却是攝景的美麗。除了有些Fade的地方不大清楚之外，而燈光的配合，確是値得讚譽！</p>
<h3 id="c270">鹽潮評 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>簡直和米榖，乃至於空氣一般，食鹽差不多是任何人每天需要的東西。在黃海東海的岸邊，有着幾百萬，乃至幾千萬，依靠着他生存的人；在長江中部有幾千萬，乃至一萬萬的人們，因爲得到他的困難，而比米榖更珍視。但是得不到食鹽的人們，果然因爲别種關系，而感到生活艱難，而親手製造食鹽的人，却更大限度的感到生活困難，甚至於餓死，凍死，於是這無邊無際的鹽潮　就怒吼了起來！</p>
<p>海水是造物的無盡藏，而燒成的食鹽，非經過鹽棧的、剥削不可，長着燒鹽葇柴的公共荒地，是海灘漲成的，而經過釘立界牌，就變成有勢力的人的私産。不領執照而燒鹽，那是［私燒］，提將官裏去；不買給鹽棧而買給價錢稍有的鹽販，那是［販私］，提將官裏去，米没有了，母親又生病，五塊錢的鹽滷，只能買四塊，於是無邊無際的鹽潮，就怒吼了起來！</p>
<p>依靠着自己的特殊的地位，和優越的經濟，做成圈套的改變少女的意志，奪取别人的戀人，於是無邊無際的鹽潮就怒吼了起來！</p>
<p>［革命快要開始</p>
<p>人們巳經起來······］（鐵流的歌）</p>
<p>在無邊無際的怒吼着的［鹽潮］裏，我們聽到這様的歌聲！不管是民國十四年的軍閥時代，或則一九三四年的目前，甚至於一九三四年以後的未來，假使有上面所說的情形存在，這無邊無際的［鹽潮］，無論如何要怒吼起來的。［土豪劣紳終於要給打倒］（字幕大意）自然，打倒他們的，是羣衆自己的力量，而不是其他什麽不相干的［主義］。在［鹽潮］中，我們是清清楚楚的看到的。</p>
<p>自然［鹽潮］中的羣衆，并不是作家隨意剏造出來的英雄。好像阿鳳（胡蝶飾）就是一個能够受胡少爺（孫敏飾）物質的誘惑的少女，她就想跟胡少爺到上海去，但是當他知道胡少爺圈了他們全村共有的葇柴地後，就變成最激烈的反抗者。這就是她的階級的覺悟。第一個人都想生活得好些，但是當他發覺自己的一羣，差不多就要到餓死，或則遭到一個很大的困難時，他一定就和自己的一羣團結起來。名片［金山］中的農民出身的工人的被欺騙，終於在大鬥爭開始的時，覺醒過來；鹽民雖則和普通的農民有點不同，但他們［有田地，有房屋，］（劇中張德三的話）是和普通農民一様的。那末，在這個條件之下的阿鳳的性格，和意識，像［鹽潮］所表現的，是絶對的正確。記得［毁滅］中有一個礦工說：［無論何人，假使更深更深的掘下去，在他的靈魂中，總有農民的存在的。］（大意）［因爲都市，是在農村的懐抱中，而礦山的工人，是和農民錯綜着的］何况鹽民的女兒呢？至於陳炳生（王徵信飾）的較堅决，也是必然的，不看見他的［販私］和［年靑］的條件嗎？未來的世界是年靑所造成的啊！</p>
<h3 id="c271">寫在［靑春之火］公映前 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 滄波</p>
<p>［靑春］：這是多麽可愛，多麽美麗的一個名詞呀。［火］又是多麽興奮，多麽的熱烈一様東西，何况現這［火］又是［靑春之火］呢？啊！這火是太熱烈了。</p>
<p>普天下每一個男女，那一個不想把他或她的靑春期，常常保持着，那一個不在燃燒着，這靑春之火，不論是男的女的醜的姘的，那一個不沉醉在這可愛的火焰中，雖然這火有時候會燒焦你的皮膚，甚而致於燒痛你的心；但他們還是勇往直前，毫不顧忌地向這可愛的火燄中奔去，有的奏着凱旋歸來了，有的是負着重傷退出了。然而事實告訴我們：這靑春是這様的容易消逝，這火焰是這様的容易熄滅。</p>
<p>天一新片［靑春之火］在卡爾登公映了，關於它的導演如何高妙，表情如何逼眞，我也不必在這裏替它做廣告，但至少它會給每一個追逐靑春之火表一點啓示。幸福的朋友們，請帶着你的愛人，到這裏來，把靑春之火裝進到你倆的心房裏去，因爲這裏有詩，這裏有畫，它能陶醉你的心靈，它能美化你的人生！</p>

<p>— 慧蘭</p>
<p>志超好像是有話要講的様子，却呑呑吐吐的欲言又止。最後他說：［這次承你救護，没有什麽補報，我今年在軍校裏就要畢業，家裏也還有點薄産，可否特令　許配給我？］</p>
<p>桂生凝思了一會，突然說道：［你傷巳好了，這兒簡慢得很，明兒請趕路吧！］</p>
<p>志超感到意外的失望，眼望着裏邊，小芬一步步地走到桂生的身旁，望着他們兩個人的臉上的表情，又慢慢低下頭去，從失望到痛苦，小芬的眼涙，差不多已經要簐簐的落下。志超看着這情形，也無可奈何的低頭走出門外，桂生看到志超在門外邊徘徊着，回頭低低的對小芬說：［你别當眞，這不過是他們有錢的一時高與，勉强高攀，將來一定没有好結果的·］　　月光是這様的清冷，志超來往的徘徊着，小芬也慢慢的走近他，默默的說不出話來·志超撫摩着小芬的肩頭，坐到石凳上面。小芬含着眼涙望着他，一會兒又一會兒，志超像是想到了什麽，附着她的耳朶，低低的在訴說，小芬在吃驚的當中，堅絶的搖着頭，志超握緊着她的手，再低低的訴說。</p>
<p>［那麽讓爸爸一個人怎辦？］她問。志超知道她已經動搖，所以說出他的補救辦法，小芬終於嬌羞的點頭答應了，兩個人含情的相對着·</p>
<p>月光從窗外射了近來，桂生已經睡熟。志超跟小芬在收拾着行裝，偷偷地推門出去兩人的影子，怱怱地在地上消逝了。鬧鐘響了，桂生從夢中驚醒，看門門外大開，知道有些不對，趕緊返身進去，小芬已不知去向，奔了出來，火車已駛過栅門，二等車中的志超小芬，使他憤恨，老眼中流出兩滴眼涙。</p>
<p>轉變，從最下的一部轉變起，小芬的脚，巳經從布鞋而換了綉花鞋，再從綉花鞋而換了高跟鞋，衣服自然也脫了短襖換旗袍，頭髮自然是該剪掉了。</p>
<p>勤務兵進來，遞上一張名片，志超看過名片，才欣喜的走到小芬的面前。［這就是我的同鄕月學，又是現在的直屬長官參謀長王鎭安，過一會你也出來見見！］</p>
<p>在這時，小芬的故鄕，深秋時節，鬧着水災！一切的一切，都被水淹没了。桂生來雜在災民當中，爭先恐後爬上鐵蓬車去逃命。</p>
<p>這個時候，小芬不是從前的様子了，細長的眉毛，蜷曲的頭髮，居然也會嬝嬝的跟着王鎭安和李志超走進繁華沈迷的跳舞廳。交際明星張曼琳，她是一個支配男性的女王，愉快的站起來，命令着一班男友，大家乾一杯，突然的看見鎭安，丢開一切的男友，走了過來，很親熱的跟鎭安招呼，毫不客氣的自己拉開椅子，坐到鎭安的身旁，又轉身向志超看了一下，以目示意的呌鎭安替她介紹。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Attitude Ambiguous on the Issue of Overseas Chinese Withdrawal from Fujian <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese residents from Fujian, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a response from the Japanese side. It is reported that the Japanese representative in Beijing verbally expressed his position to our diplomatic authorities, but his attitude was ambiguous. Regarding our request for withdrawal, he neither indicated acceptance nor formally rejected it. Concerned parties are paying close attention to this. Some have met with responsible persons in diplomatic circles to inquire whether our government would be liable for compensation should danger arise in the future if the Japanese side does not withdraw from Fujian. The response was that, according to international law, if the government deems it necessary to compensate or provide allowances to its own citizens who have suffered disasters, foreign residents should be treated similarly; otherwise, foreign residents cannot receive special treatment. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles report that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously sent notes to the embassies of various countries requesting that foreign residents in Fujian be assisted in leaving the province. Various countries have responded one after another. Most British and American residents have already voluntarily left Fujian, with only one or two missionaries remaining. However, due to the large number of Japanese residents, whether or not they will all be relocated has not yet been concretely decided. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chinese government recently requested that foreign residents in inland Fujian retreat to Nantai and Gulangyu. First Secretary Hallam of the British Embassy, acting on behalf of Minister Ingram, gave a verbal reply, stating that he had instructed the British consuls in Fuzhou and Xiamen to advise British residents to relocate as circumstances allowed. However, the British authorities hope that the Chinese government will not only protect British residents in Fuzhou and Xiamen but also those in the interior. The American reply differs in wording from the British one, but the meaning is the same. The American authorities also require the Chinese government to be responsible for protecting American residents throughout Fujian Province. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>3.  When bondholders apply for added interest coupons or exchange for new bonds, they should obtain an application form from the managing agency, fill it out according to the format, and specify the type, number of bonds, and denomination, as well as attach the number of unmatured interest coupons or principal and interest coupons. On the front of the original bond, to the right of the Ministry of Finance seal, each bond should be stamped with the applicant's personal seal or signature, and the application form should also be stamped with the same seal or signature. Those applying for added interest coupons should stamp or sign the upper left corner of the bond for Military Expenditure Bonds, the lower right corner for Disbandment Bonds, the upper right corner for 19th Year Customs Bonds, and the lower right corner for 20th Year Disaster Relief Bonds and 20th Year Financial Bonds, and transcribe the original bond number in the blank space. All should be submitted to the Bond Exchange Office or the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications in various locations to obtain a temporary receipt. 4. When the Bond Exchange Office or the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications receive the aforementioned application form and bonds, they should first verify whether the number of bonds and attached interest coupons or principal and interest coupons matches the information provided in the application form. Next, they should verify whether the bond and application form have been stamped with the applicant's personal seal or signature. If applying for added interest coupons, they must also verify that the number copied on the corner to be cut off is correct and that it has been stamped or signed with the same seal or signature, and verify that the original bond number has not been drawn for redemption. If it has been drawn, it should be immediately returned to the bondholder, and they should be informed to take it to the managing bank to redeem the principal. After verifying that the received bonds are correct, a temporary receipt should be issued and given to the bondholder for safekeeping. 5. For the aforementioned temporary receipt, the Bond Exchange Office will use a two-part form, with one part for the stub and one part for the bondholder. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will use a four-part form, with the first part as the receipt, the second part as the notification slip, the third part as the report form, and the fourth part as the stub. The aforementioned four-part receipt will be printed in red by the Central Bank of China, in blue by the Bank of China, and in green by the Bank of Communications. Each managing bank will print them themselves, but the format, paper size, and colors must all conform to the model issued by the Ministry. 6. The following interest coupons and principal and interest coupons should be submitted for the aforementioned six types of bonds: Six interest coupons from No. 16 to No. 21 for Military Expenditure Bonds; six interest coupons from No. 15 to No. 20 for Disbandment Bonds; eight interest coupons from No. 13 to No. 20 for 19th Year Customs Bonds; eleven interest coupons from No. 10 to No. 20 for 20th Year Disaster Relief Bonds; seven interest coupons from No. 9 to No. 15 for 20th Year Financial Bonds; and twenty-seven principal and interest coupons from No. 40 to No. 66 for 19th Year Post-Reorganization Treasury Bills. If any of the aforementioned attached interest coupons or principal and interest coupons are missing, the Bond Exchange Office should deduct the missing number of periods and coupons from the added interest coupons or new bonds to be issued, and provide a voucher to the bondholder for safekeeping. If the exchange is handled on behalf of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, or the Bank of Communications, the Bond Exchange Office will hand over this voucher to the three banks for forwarding. 7. If the aforementioned missing interest coupons or principal and interest coupons are later found, the bondholder may, together with the original voucher, take them to the Bond Exchange Office or entrust them to the managing bank to exchange for the previously deducted new interest coupons or principal and interest coupons. However, if the interest coupons or principal and interest coupons are found after the three-year redemption period has expired, or if the voucher is lost when they are found, they will be deemed invalid, and the previously deducted new interest coupons or principal and interest coupons cannot be reclaimed. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications should pay special attention to the bondholders' missing interest coupons or principal and interest coupons, and clearly indicate them on the temporary receipt, notification slip, report form, and stub. The Bond Exchange Office should properly preserve the aforementioned deducted new interest coupons or principal and interest coupons for bondholders to claim at any time, and report a list of them to the Ministry of Finance on a ten-day basis for record-keeping. 8. The Bond Exchange Office or the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications in various locations should examine the secret marks, cross-check the numbers, and the attached interest coupons or principal and interest coupons of the bonds received each day. After verifying that they are correct, for those applying for added interest coupons, the bonds should be temporarily preserved. For Military Expenditure Bonds, a rectangular corner of nine centimeters vertically and six centimeters horizontally should be cut off from the upper left corner of the front of the bond. For Disbandment Bonds, a corner should be cut off from the lower right corner. For 19th Year Customs Bonds, a corner should be cut off from the upper right corner. For 20th Year Disaster Relief Bonds and 20th Year Financial Bonds, a corner should be cut off from the lower right corner. For 20th Year Disaster Relief Bonds, the corner should be six centimeters vertically and nine centimeters horizontally, and for 20th Year Financial Bonds, the corner should be six centimeters vertically and twelve centimeters horizontally. The seal of the managing agency should be stamped on the corner (corner size as shown in the diagram on the left). On the bond, a stamp should be added indicating that the added interest coupons have been issued from number X to number Y. For the 19th Year Post-Reorganization Treasury Bills, a cancellation stamp should be added to the center of the front of the bond, and the stamp should conform to the Ministry's prescribed format.</p>
<p>9.  The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications should deliver the corners of Military Expenditure Bonds, Disbandment Bonds, 19th Year Customs Bonds, 20th Year Disaster Relief Bonds, and 20th Year Financial Bonds, or the old 19th Year Post-Reorganization Treasury Bills, along with the notification slips for applying for added interest coupons or exchanging for new bonds, sent from their branches in various locations, to the Bond Exchange Office to obtain a receipt. 10. After receiving the bond corners or old bills delivered by the bondholders or the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, the Bond Exchange Office should, within five days, after verifying that they are correct, issue the added interest coupons or new bills based on the temporary receipt or receipt. If the number of items submitted is excessive and the verification cannot be completed on schedule, the exchange period may be extended. 11. The Bond Exchange Office should issue all added interest coupons or new bonds according to the denomination of the corners or old bills submitted, but the denominations of large and small bills may be adjusted as appropriate. If bondholders require large or small bills for the 19th Year Post-Reorganization Treasury Bills, they may state so when applying for the exchange and pay a printing fee of 1.25 per mille according to the denomination of the type of bill specified, which will also be handled accordingly. If the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications collect this printing fee on behalf, they should submit it along with the old bills to the Bond Exchange Office for verification and receipt. 12. Bondholders may, after five days, stamp the back of the temporary receipt with the same seal or signature as on the application form and take it to the Bond Exchange Office to collect the added interest coupons and the original bonds, or exchange for new bonds. Those who entrust the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to collect on their behalf may collect from the original managing bank on the agreed date, the date being determined by the managing bank in consideration of the distance of the journey. 13. The Ministry of Finance entrusts the Central Bank to keep the aforementioned added interest coupons and new bonds prepared for issuance, and the Bond Exchange Office may apply for them from time to time for exchange. 14. The Bond Exchange Office should punch holes in all the received bond corners or old bonds, taking care not to damage the seal or signature of the bondholder and the number on the bond, and should classify them by type, compile them into bundles of fifty, and send them to the National Debt Fund Management Committee for safekeeping, pending destruction, and submit a list along with the exchange situation to the Ministry of Finance on a ten-day basis for record-keeping. 15. When the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications in various locations send out the bond corners or old bonds, they should immediately fill out and send a mailing or transportation report form to the head office for forwarding to the Ministry of Finance for record-keeping. The format of the report form is the same as the form for reporting the payment of interest coupons by mail or transportation. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications also apply the aforementioned report form when mailing or transporting added interest coupons or new bonds, fill it out and report it to the Ministry for record-keeping, but must add the words "added interest coupons" or "new bonds" to indicate the distinction. 16. The added interest coupons for Military Expenditure Bonds will begin to be issued on January 29th of the 23rd year of the Republic and will end on January 28th of the 24th year. The added interest coupons for the 19th Year Customs Bonds will begin to be issued on February 24th of the 23rd year of the Republic and will end on February 23rd of the 24th year. The added interest coupons for Disbandment Bonds will begin to be issued on March 10th of the 23rd year of the Republic and will end on March 9th of the 24th year. The added interest coupons for 20th Year Financial Bonds will begin to be issued on March 24th of the 23rd year of the Republic and will end on March 23rd of the 24th year. The added interest coupons for 20th Year Disaster Relief Bonds will begin to be issued on April 5th of the 23rd year of the Republic and will end on April 4th of the 24th year. The exchange of new bonds for the 19th Year Post-Reorganization Treasury Bills will begin on February 10th of the 23rd year of the Republic and will end on February 9th of the 24th year.</p>

<p>丨After the Meeting Between Simon and Mussolini丨</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon met with Blackshirt Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome. What exactly was discussed and whether a concrete agreement was reached remains to be seen. From the perspective of time and reason, it is unlikely that things could move so quickly. However, the Italian Prime Minister's opinions are biased towards artificial changes to the League of Nations and technical issues regarding arms reduction. Italy already announced its intention to reorganize the League of Nations at the end of last year. On the surface, this seems to fully sympathize with Germany's movement to revise the Treaty of Versailles and is in clear opposition to France. In reality, Italy wants to use Germany's strength to control France and use the reorganization of the League of Nations to change the current organization where small countries have the same voting rights as large countries in League of Nations meetings. This would reduce France's manipulation in Central Europe and increase Italy's possibility of achieving hegemony. This kind of move is enough to arouse some sympathy from Germany. However, on the other hand, it will provoke the resentment of the small countries in Central Europe. Because they are led by France, they can indirectly obtain some benefits due to their opposition to Germany. They also have room to speak and deliberate at League of Nations meetings. If Italy's proposal is implemented, the vested rights of small countries will inevitably be deprived. After the excessive development of nationalism, the survival of small countries is particularly worrying. Therefore, the Little Entente will become increasingly dependent on France, and Poland's opposition to Germany will become more serious. Therefore, I say that Italy's desire to reorganize the League of Nations is ultimately just a one-sided ideal.</p>
<p>As for changing Article 16 of the Covenant to revise the provisions on the inviolability of national territory and ensuring that the League of Nations Covenant is practically implementable, this fundamentally denies the League of Nations and repeats international disputes, exacerbating the stalemate in Europe and even the world. The League of Nations has always held high the banner of pacifism and international cooperation. In fact, all countries in the world, whether economically or politically, are moving towards isolationism, such as economic alliances, increasing tariffs, strengthening armaments, building warships, and promoting military-industrial production. All these facts show that they are preparing for war. However, except for Japan, the major countries are all maintaining a peaceful state and are not willing to take risks lightly in the use of force. Therefore, this League of Nations, which only has a semblance of substance, still has a slight influence in the diplomatic arena. If this kind of provision that only has moral scope is also removed, I am afraid that ambitious countries will become more barbaric and have no limits.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of arms reduction, observing the world as a whole, it seems that countries have abandoned the peace movement in the past year and turned to arms competition. In capitalist countries, most are strengthening their military and making their existing troops more powerful. Even the socialist Soviet Union is working hard to strengthen its national defense, mechanize its army, and prepare for national mobilization, even surpassing Japan. Therefore, the so-called arms reduction is at most a temporary respite to avoid the current economic panic. The current situation in Europe, with the conflict between Germany and France, is most likely to lead to direct conflict. This is why it is necessary to seek a way to ease the situation.</p>
<p>The so-called crisis of 1936 did not originate in Europe. Because the Washington Naval Treaty is expiring, the three major naval powers, based on the current situation, find it difficult to continue the 5:5:3 ratio. Japan's demand for equality is even more difficult for Britain and the United States to accept. It is recognized that hegemony over the Pacific Ocean, especially in the Western Pacific, has been seized by Japan. In order to develop future markets and maintain the current situation, the United States has no choice but to expand its existing naval power. Japan will naturally catch up quickly, and Britain will not be left behind. Thus, the naval race begins, and the crisis becomes more apparent. However, Japan's national strength is limited. Although modern industry has developed considerably, natural resources are weak. Economic development is difficult to achieve in a short period of time. Therefore, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota has reset the diplomatic policy, creating a smokescreen of Japanese military action in an attempt to delay military competition and escape its international isolation. However, this makes the League of Nations' position more difficult, and the term arms reduction may in fact be counterproductive.</p>
<h3 id="e4">League of Nations Technical Cooperation Expert Choutens Arrives in Peiping <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Will Go to Nanking after a Two-Week Stay</p>
<p>(Peiping) League of Nations technical cooperation expert Choutens (French), left Belgium last August to go to Mexico to attend the 22nd League of Nations Statistical Conference. Then, he went to America to give lectures on international cooperation issues. He left America on December 10th to go to Japan, and arrived in China from Japan on the 28th. He arrived in Peiping on the evening of the 4th and is scheduled to stay for two weeks, then he will go to Nanking to visit our government authorities. On the 8th and 9th, at the invitation of the Sino-French University and Peking University, he will give lectures on [the possibility of realizing international cooperation]. According to Choutens, he has assisted more than 40 international organizations and the governments of 12 countries with technical problems, but no government or organization has had long-term work, especially in League of Nations work. He has also practically participated in international cooperation with the League of Nations Labor Bureau in Geneva and is very interested. This time he is traveling around the world, hoping that countries can achieve closer cooperation. In the past 15 years, I have only assisted various international conferences, such as administrative, diplomatic, political, and technical, etc., and have not made much contribution. The League of Nations is deeply dissatisfied with Japan's occupation of the Northeast. China is currently facing serious difficulties, and due to the constraints of various unequal treaties, it is unable to cooperate effectively with the League of Nations, which is very regrettable. In the future, he will work hard to promote its progress. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>A Golden Opportunity for Financial Circles to Oppose Military Budget</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning at 9:00 a.m., Arakaki, the bedridden Minister of the Army, was announced by his attending physician as follows: Due to insufficient sleep last night, he suffered from headaches and fatigue this morning. Coughing and phlegm are of moderate severity. Appetite has increased compared to yesterday. There are symptoms of pneumonia in the lower right lung. (5th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a statement from the military medical department, Minister of the Army Arakaki's illness will require at least one month of treatment. Therefore, Arakaki will not be able to attend the Internal Affairs Conference and the 65th Diet session. The Central Army Department held a meeting yesterday to study countermeasures and decided not to appoint a temporary acting Minister of the Army. The following countermeasures were also decided: (1) Although the Internal Affairs Conference is very important, its principles have already been decided. If there are important issues to be discussed, Vice Minister Yanagawa will be sent to participate. Otherwise, Secretary-General Horikiri will be asked to report on the progress of the meeting regularly. (2) Minister of the Army Arakaki will not be able to attend the 65th Diet session until early February. During this period, the Vice Minister and Parliamentary Secretary will answer questions from the military at any time. (5th Hualian Telegram)</p>

Minister of Interior Yamamoto even stated that 3-4 million yen would be appropriate.

<p>●Rome It has been learned today that British Foreign Secretary Simon and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini have decided on the most urgent issues currently facing Europe, namely that a disarmament agreement should be established quickly and that the restructuring of the League of Nations should be relegated to secondary importance. The League of Nations must be restructured, but this should wait until the disarmament issue is resolved and the legitimate demands of France and Germany are satisfied. Furthermore, the restructuring of the League of Nations must aim to strengthen its structure. British Foreign Secretary Simon issued an article to reporters today, stating that he felt that politicians in all countries recognized that failure to reach a disarmament agreement would be detrimental to all countries. He had seen complete sincerity everywhere, and the talks in Rome and Paris were all of value. It is heard that the politicians did not discuss any actual plans for restructuring the League of Nations; only Mussolini briefly mentioned how the League of Nations should be reformed. British Foreign Secretary Simon departed from here today, taking the route through Paris to return to London.

That is, restructuring the League of Nations is secondary to disarmament. Simon also stated that the Italian Prime Minister firmly believed that the current chaotic situation in Europe must be clarified as soon as possible to avoid serious threats to world peace. Simon further stated that while reforming the League of Nations is important, the politicians he met believed that disarmament should be resolved first. Regarding disarmament, he believed that Germany's spiritual equality and equal military armament should be recognized, and pointed out Article 26 of the Covenant, which stipulates amendment procedures, stating that the amendment can increase the strength of the League of Nations and the Covenant. He also stated that all the politicians with whom he had discussed these issues believed that if a war were to break out, no country in the world could escape the resulting suffering.

<p>●Rome It was reliably learned today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in his two talks with British Foreign Secretary Simon, supported several demands made by German Chancellor Hitler. Mussolini reiterated his long-held belief that Germany should be granted spiritual equality. The meaning of this move is to abolish the clause in the Treaty of Versailles that Germany was the aggressor. In addition, Mussolini also told Simon that the Germans should be granted the right to limited rearmament so that the prestige of the German people and the Hitler government could be maintained. In addition, the two also discussed at length Italy's proposal to restructure the League of Nations. Mussolini stated that the restructuring of the League of Nations should be implemented immediately after the disarmament issue is resolved. Today, the Italian Foreign Ministry issued a communique confirming that the two sides had discussed the issues of disarmament and restructuring the League of Nations. The communique stated that Mussolini's and Simon's two talks here studied the major issues related to the policy of restructuring the League of Nations. In addition, the limitation of armaments also received the closest attention. Both sides agreed that the disarmament negotiations should be concluded as soon as possible.

<p>▲ Far Eastern Situation Promotes Change</p>
<p>▲ Japan's Isolation is the Merit of the League of Nations</p>
<p>●Moscow Since Molotov and Litvinov made their remarks a few days ago, general public opinion has recognized that these remarks are sufficient to show that Soviet Russia's attitude towards the League of Nations has recently changed greatly. Therefore, political and diplomatic circles are using the possibility of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations as the sole basis for discussion. It is said that if Soviet Russia joins the League of Nations, it will be very suitable for Soviet Russia's long-proclaimed policy of peaceful cooperation. However, the biggest reason for the change in Soviet Russia's attitude is the situation in the Far East. Soviet Russia believes that Japan's isolation is the merit of the League of Nations, and Japan's isolated position has given a serious obstacle to the expansion of Japanese imperialism. Therefore, the League of Nations can also be called an important factor in maintaining peace in the Far East. For this reason, Soviet Russia has a strong intention to cooperate closely with the League of Nations, and the most natural way is to send a permanent observer to Geneva, and then request formal accession after a few days.

<p>League of Nations Executive Council Meeting on January 15</p>
<p>Promotes Germany's Return to the Disarmament Conference</p>

The differences of opinion between the two sides have been reduced by short-term contact, but it is difficult to hope for an early understanding without the cooperation of other major powers. The British government is now advocating convening a meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council on January 15, at which representatives from Britain, France, Italy, and the United States will study the situation of the Franco-German negotiations and the results of the Mussolini-Simon talks, study the disarmament issue, strive to accommodate Germany's views, and seek a general understanding so as to lead Germany back to the Disarmament Conference. Therefore, after the League of Nations Executive Council meets, the major powers will make new proposals to Germany, but this will depend on whether France agrees with Britain's approach.

<p>(Paris) There has been much speculation about the content of the French memorandum sent to Germany on the issue of armaments. News from London claims to know the details of the memorandum. A certain local morning newspaper published it. According to this news, it seems that there is something new in the memorandum. However, according to what we have heard, and the news supplemented by reliable sources, it proves that the rumors from outside are all unfounded. In fact, the French government only stated in the memorandum that the Franco-German negotiations can only aim at universal disarmament, and cannot discuss German rearmament. The memorandum also explained the scope and conditions under which France itself is prepared to reduce its armaments. How can the memorandum, as the news from London said, allow Germany a certain amount of military strength? (4th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>●Helsinki The German National Socialist Party is quite active among the small countries along the Baltic Sea. Its sole purpose is to seize near-control of the Baltic regions, which is the so-called German policy of expansion to the east. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov spoke about this last year, expressing concern about Germany's expansion to the east, saying that the independence of the Baltic countries is closely related to Soviet Russia. Therefore, it proposed a security plan to Poland, advocating that the two countries guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of neighboring countries. On December 23 of last year, the governments of Soviet Russia and Poland proposed to the Finnish government that the three countries issue a declaration stating that the independence of the Baltic countries is closely related to Russia and Poland, and that if someone invades these countries, Soviet Russia and Poland are prepared to provide assistance. The Finnish government has recently rejected this proposal. (4th Havas Telegram)</p>

The news agency also stated that it is regrettable that Germany's peace policy has always been doubted. It is rumored that Hitler intends to propose to Poland to conclude a non-aggression treaty, but on the condition that Poland allows Germany's power to expand to land that does not belong to Poland. The German News Agency stated that this news is absolutely untrue. (4th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) Judging from the US budget, President Roosevelt wants to spend a total of 840 million yuan on various projects from today until the end of the fiscal year at the end of June. The scale of this number is unprecedented in peacetime. The government estimates that its revenue in the next 18 months is based on a 34 percent increase in industrial production during this period. The budget director and comptroller have the power to supervise temporary spending. House Speaker Rainey, referring to this budget, said that the deficit in the budget is truly alarming. House Republican Leader Snell said that he was shocked to hear of the amount of money the authorities intended to use. However, Senator Reed said that the people would definitely be able to bear the burden of 310 million yuan without worry.</p>
<p>Treasury Deficit of 600 Million Yuan</p>
<p>(Washington) The US Treasury Department today issued its annual report, stating that by the end of the fiscal year on June 30, the Treasury will have a deficit of 6,621,239,711 yuan, which, except during wartime, is the largest deficit in American history. The total national debt will reach 28,679,969,728 yuan, also an unprecedented debt. This is because it is expected that relief spending will increase month by month in the next six months, increasing the monthly deficit by 100 million yuan. The total expenditure of the national treasury for the whole year will reach 9,891,178,467 yuan. Only the wartime expenditures of 1918 and 1919 exceeded this number. The total revenue for the whole year will be 3,259,938,756 yuan. It is estimated that regular government expenses account for only 3,533,691,767 yuan of the total expenditure, and the rest is relief and reconstruction expenses. The Financial Reconstruction Corporation alone spent 3,969,740,000 yuan, followed by the principal and interest on the national debt, which also reached 742 million yuan. As for the Army, it only spent 61,880,800 yuan, and the Navy only spent 56,063,200 yuan. Compared with the previous two items, it is like a small witch compared to a big witch. As for the Treasury's income, various domestic stamp taxes are the most, accounting for 41 percent of the total income. On the other hand, income tax accounts for only 36 percent, the lowest tax revenue in nine years. The estimated regular expenditures for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1935, are only 4,486,562,500 yuan, including Army expenses of 62,007,700 yuan and Navy expenses of 288,030,725 yuan. The estimated revenue for that year is 3,974,665,479 yuan. (4th National Telegram)</p>

<p>To Begin Drafting a New Trade Agreement</p>
<p>To Be Formally Signed in Ten Days</p>
<p>Japanese Businesses to Cancel Boycott of Indian Cotton</p>
<p>Conditional on Reducing Tariffs</p>
<p>◎New Delhi: The final meeting of the India-Japan conference was held at noon on the 5th, attended by all representatives from both sides. The establishment of the India-Japan Agreement has been confirmed. (5th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The India-Japan conference formally finalized all the items discussed on the 5th. At the same time, it was decided to abolish the boycott of Indian cotton and implement a reduction in cotton cloth tariffs. Therefore, the India-Japan Agreement can be said to have officially come to an end in fact. However, the drafting committee composed of representatives from both countries will begin work on the treaty on the 6th to complete it as soon as possible. However, the return of Governor Bowra is expected around the 9th. The draft must be initialed by both parties, and then the document will be mailed to Mr. Matsudaira, the Japanese ambassador in London, and Foreign Minister Simon for their signatures. The British side has already stated that it will not interfere in any decisions made by India and Japan. Therefore, this India-Japan trade treaty should be able to be announced in late January or early February. The above signature is only a formality, and the effect of the treaty will in fact occur simultaneously with the temporary initialing. It is reported that the Japanese government and private representatives will withdraw immediately after the temporary initialing. (5th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>●New Delhi: Today's India-Japan plenary meeting was held here at noon (3:30 PM Japan time). All the negotiated items were endorsed and passed. Because the negotiated items have been contacted in advance, they must be implemented as soon as possible. Therefore, the following three items will be provisionally initialed: (1) The Japanese side cancels the boycott of Indian cotton, (2) The Indian government reduces cotton cloth tariffs to 50%, or 5 annas and a quarter per pound, (3) Simultaneously implement the distribution of cotton cloth imports. It was decided to implement it from the 8th and issue a declaration in the form of minutes of the meeting, signed by representatives Sawada and Bowra. The meeting ended at 0:40 PM. The full text of the minutes will be released simultaneously in Tokyo and New Delhi on the afternoon of the 6th. (5th Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>●New Delhi: A special correspondent reported that the India-Japan plenary meeting, which opened at noon on the 5th, should formally confirm the agreed matters. The content is roughly as follows: It covers all the issues that have been agreed upon, regarding the most-favored-nation treatment clause, (1) the clause that the two countries should negotiate when making general tariff revisions, (1) the exchange rate clause, (1) the clause on increasing cotton cloth tax rates, (1) the clause on cotton cloth import ratios, (1) the clause on the separation of Burma, (1) the clause on the effective period of import ratios. In this agreement clause, regarding the tariff of the Darwan (达运?) export principle, except for Goa, there are currently about 4.5 million yards of cotton cloth stored in bonded warehouses, so the benefits received by the Japanese side are not small. (4th Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>Matsudaira's Talk</p>
<p>(London) Today, Matsudaira, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, told a Reuters reporter about the India-Japan cotton industry agreement, saying that the atmosphere for the start of British-Japanese negotiations should be more satisfactory than before. The British often attribute the sluggish trade to Japanese competition. Now that the trade situation is gradually improving in the new year, the British should have a more reasonable attitude. Matsudaira mentioned the low price level, saying that a bicycle worth one pound and a hat worth fifteen pence will definitely not be durable. Japanese people like British goods because they are durable. He also said that Japanese businessmen are very willing to resolve peacefully and avoid tariff wars, so the European war will destroy the old friendship between Britain and Japan. After the establishment of the India-Japan agreement, some people are worried that halving the tariffs will give Japanese goods a great price advantage, but Lancashire businessmen welcome this agreement for the following reasons: (1) British-Japanese conferences can start immediately, (2) Japanese goods imported into India are ultimately limited, (3) The Indian government is now free to conclude British-Indian agreements on cotton and rayon. Lancashire is therefore now preparing various plans. (4th Reuters)</p>
<p>British Newspaper Commentary</p>
<p>(London) The Financial News today commented on the India-Japan cotton industry agreement, saying that this kind of agreement is indeed needed, but at most it will only prevent the cotton industry problem from expanding. The original difficulties of Lancashire still exist. Its very important major market in the East, which it has always supplied, is now completely self-sufficient or an active exporter. No matter what the content of the agreement, the agreement has been established after all. This is the key point, otherwise the competition will be more intense and the animosity will be deeper.

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Xiang telegraphed Chairman Chiang and President Wang, according to Fan Shaozeng's telegram, Sui County was recovered. The bandit's brutal behavior was surveyed by dispatched personnel, according to the report: (1) After the bandits entered the city, they looted civilian goods.

(3) Young men and women in the city and suburbs were all forced to serve as guerrilla pioneers and comfort teams. When they collapsed, they forced the people to go with them. Only the old, weak, and disabled were left. (4) All official documents, files, registers, books, boxes, and public property in official agencies, organs, and schools in the city were burned and nothing remained. (5) Clothes in houses on all streets were swept away, the four walls were desolate, no one was in sight, horse manure was everywhere, and weeds were a foot high, which was unbearable to see. (6) Deep pits were dug in Xunmen (勋门?) training grounds, river sand dams, various official offices, public offices, and supervisory offices, burying dozens or hundreds of male and female corpses. Today, another deep pit was found in the training ground, containing more than 20 female corpses wearing girls' school uniforms.

<p>●Telegram from Zhengzhou: To the Shen Bao Newspaper,</p>
<p>Upon reading your newspaper's January 2nd combined issue, it was stated that on the 28th, coal cars on this line overturned in Sishui, severely injuring 17 passengers and railway workers. This is inconsistent with the facts. It has been verified that there were no passengers on the car, and no employees were injured. It was completely repaired on the same day and resumed normal operation. The reason for the derailment was that all the cars were foreign cars, and the size and condition were different. When encountering the initial snow, the tracks were slippery. When passing through the Xiapo (下破?) Great Bay, one car was squeezed off the track, and the remaining cars were pulled off the track, but they did not overturn, so the repairs were very fast. Due to inaccurate information, we hereby request a correction. Please do so accordingly. Sincerely, Longhai Railway Administration.</p>

<p>And Build a Motor Road from Hada Camp to Yanqing</p>
<p>Four Japanese Aircraft Suddenly Bomb Chicheng</p>
<p>Beiping correspondence: The Japanese troops invading eastern Chahar have decided not to withdraw due to concerns about Russia. Recently, in addition to establishing a bandit suppression headquarters in Heihe, they have also built a large-scale airfield in Hada Camp in the second and fourth districts of Guyuan. It has now been completed and 24 aircraft are stationed there. A motor road 18 feet wide is also being built, running directly from Hada Camp to Yanqing. It has already started. Yanqing is the western border line of the war zone, only 25 li away from Kangzhuang. This kind of action by the Japanese army contains great conspiracies. The Chahar provincial authorities have already telegraphed the Beiping authorities to make representations to the Japanese side. In addition, after Liu Guitang's troops left Chicheng, the Japanese army suddenly dispatched four aircraft on the 2nd and 3rd to inspect the defense area of the Chahar army Zhang Yuanrong's troops in the Chicheng Yongning area and dropped dozens of bombs back and forth. The Chahar provincial authorities also telegraphed Beiping for instructions. The Beiping Military Branch will send Zhu Shiqin to visit the Japanese embassy military attache Hobon to inquire. The military attache replied that they were bombing the bandit troops of Liu Guitang's unit. Zhu immediately told him that Liu's troops had fled south. Hobon agreed to convey this to the Japanese Kwantung Army and stop bombing. The actions of the Japanese army in eastern Chahar are becoming increasingly strange, and their intentions are difficult to fathom. (January 4th)</p>

<p>Intending to Cross Southern Beiping and Flee to Shandong and Henan</p>
<p>Troops Stationed in Various Places Strictly Block and Attack</p>
<p>Beiping correspondence: After Liu Guitang's troops defected and left Chicheng, they actually raised the banner of the Second Army of the East Asia Collaboration Army. They fled through Yongning and Yanqing towards the war zone. In advance, they sent representatives to contact the Japanese Kwantung Army, claiming that they were being oppressed by the Chahar army and could not gain a foothold in Chahar, requesting to enter the war zone and seek temporary protection. The Japanese side rejected this, replying that if they invaded the war zone, they would be dealt with. Since Liu was rejected, after fleeing to Erdaoguan, he did not dare to directly enter the war zone. Instead, he followed in the footsteps of Fang Ji and moved south along the edge of the war zone. At 4:00 PM on December 31st, they fled near the Ming Tombs Dahongmen between Changping and Nankou. After the authorities received news that Liu's troops were trying to enter the war zone, in addition to ordering the Chahar army to track and pursue, they also ordered the troops stationed in the Changping Nankou area to strictly block and, at the same time, ordered the security team in the war zone to guard the border of the war zone. The Changping Ming Tombs area is defended by Zhu Hongxun's 130th Division of Wan Fulin's army. When Liu's troops fled near the Ming Tombs, they clashed with a certain regiment of Zhu's division in the Dahongmen area. At dawn on New Year's Day, Liu's troops launched a surprise attack on Zhu's division, copying from Dahongmen to the Great and Small Tangshan, attempting to bypass Changping. The situation was extremely fierce. After fierce fighting for several hours, both sides suffered heavy casualties. Liu's troops fled into the Tangshan market town and looted wildly. At about 2:00 PM, Zhu's division attacked from the east of Changping towards the east, and Guan Linzheng's division of the Central Army blocked from Mafang towards the north. After fierce fighting until about 5:00 PM, Liu's troops could not hold out and fled in droves from the eastern mountains and rivers. That night, they passed north of Mafang and fled into Shunyi County. At about 6:00 AM on the 2nd, a portion fled to Shilibu, 12 li south of Shunyi County, and came into contact with a certain regiment of Liu Duoquan's 105th Division. A portion suddenly arrived in the Niulanshan Gaoliying area, looting along the way. The residents suffered terrible devastation. The authorities ordered the troops stationed in northern Beiping to jointly encircle and suppress them. Liu Duoquan's troops and Li Xingcun's division of Shang Zhen's troops all went out to encircle from three sides. Liu's troops were mostly cavalry, running east and west, and their whereabouts were erratic. On the morning of that day, the remnants of Liu's troops in the Great and Small Tangshan area were completely cleared. There was still a portion in the Niulanshan Gaoliying area, which was being surrounded and dealt with. However, at about 3:00 PM that afternoon, dozens of Liu's cavalry suddenly arrived in Dongba, near Tongzhou, northern Beiping, wantonly burning and looting, and clashed with the local security team. At about 5:00 PM, government troops arrived from Yujiawei and scattered them. At about 8:00 PM that night, Liu's troops in that area began to flee towards Gaoqiao. On that day, they fled to Gaoqiao Shuangqiao at night. The Beiping military and police, because the bandits were only a dozen li from the city, sent troops to block them in the eastern suburbs and stepped up the city's defenses. On the 3rd, Liu's troops fled south through Dawangzhuang towards Hadian. Dozens more fled to the southern suburbs at night. The 105th Division stationed there blocked them. Gunfire broke out for a long time, and it could be heard very clearly in the city. After an hour, Liu's troops fled west along the Yongding River. On the 4th, the national army had gone to both banks of the Yongding River to pursue. The main force of Liu's troops fleeing east from northern Beiping was about 3,000 people. Also, on the morning of the 3rd, when Liu's troops invaded Wuqing County, they came into contact with the troops stationed there. Liu's troops were determined to flee and did not dare to linger. At about 11:00 AM, they crossed the railway and fled to Anci. They were blocked again by the troops stationed there. On the morning of the 4th, they had fled to Yin'an, attempting to escape to Puyang, Caozhou, and other places through the counties in southern Hebei. The Hebei Provincial Government has ordered the troops stationed in the counties of southern Hebei to work with the local militia security teams to strictly block them and send Bai Fengxiang's cavalry to pursue them, striving to encircle and resolve them in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>On the 4th, Wang Yizhe, commander of the 67th Army, and the staff office of the army both sent telegrams to Beiping, reporting on the situation of blocking and suppressing Liu's troops. The telegrams are as follows: (1) Wang's telegram stated that Liu Guitang's bandit troops of more than 3,000 people fled to Anci at 3:00 AM on the 3rd, suddenly crossed the Beining Railway south between Aigezhuang and Wanzhuang in Langfang, robbing and killing along the way. Yue Rusheng, commander of the 650th Regiment of the 117th Division, led his troops to pursue, and Liu's bandits fled and scattered south. When they arrived at Dawulong Village, they were again severely attacked by Chen Enling, commander of the 2nd Battalion of the regiment, capturing more than 40 bandits, seizing 40 to 50 horses and mules, and more than 30 guns, and killing more than 80 bandits. The remnants of the bandits, about 50 or 60, changed into plain clothes at Yongledian, south of Tongxian, at 2:00 PM on the 3rd, and fled east across the Bai River. Zhu Zirong, commander of the 620th Regiment of the 107th Division, has dispatched more than 100 cavalry to pursue them. Another remnant force of about 300 to 400 people entrenched in the four villages of Maojiaying and Zhangjiawu in Anci County at 6:00 PM on the 3rd. Su Chengmou, commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 649th Regiment of the 117th Division, is leading his troops to pursue. The bandits have fled towards Gu'an. (2) The staff office telegraphed that after more than 2,000 Liu's bandits were defeated in Dawulong Village on the 3rd, they fled towards the Yongding River bank. Wang Zhihan, commander of the 694th Regiment of the 117th Division, led his troops to pursue and advanced towards Gu'an. Liu Hanyu, commander of the 628th Regiment of the 107th Division, led his troops to pursue from Jiuzhou Town towards the north bank of the Yongding River. The 629th Regiment of the 110th Division was stationed in Hanzhuang to block them. The 3rd Company of the Armored Train patrolled between Langfang and Anding. Liu's bandits attempted to flee to Henan and join the Communist bandits.</p>
<p>Xia Ziming's brigade of Liu's troops broke away from Liu at the beginning of Liu's defection and remained stationed in the original defense of Longmensuo, declaring their obedience to the orders of the Chahar Provincial Government. Chairman Song Zheyuan of Chahar, considering that Xia was deeply aware of righteousness, has submitted a request to the Beiping Military Commission to reorganize Xia's troops into a brigade, consisting of one cavalry regiment and two infantry regiments. Xia's troops will be paid with the original salary of Liu's troops. (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Talk While Passing Through Manila (Philippines Correspondence) <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Amidst this period of both external and internal troubles, the news suddenly came that Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the President of the Legislative Yuan, would be taking a short trip to Manila. On the morning of December 23rd, he arrived in Manila aboard the President Hoover. Accompanying him were his wife and two sons, as well as former Air Force Commander Zhang Huichang, former Minister of Finance Huang Hanliang, Legislative Yuan member Wu Jingxiong, and Secretary Yu Ming, along with several others. After disembarking, Mr. Sun immediately went to the Consulate General to meet with Chinese and foreign reporters. He made the following statement to the Western press reporters: "[After the Philippines becomes independent, it should pay close attention to the ambitions of the Japanese Empire. Japan will definitely act as it did in Manchuria, first invading the Philippines with economic power, and then overcoming it politically. Japan is constantly watching the Philippines, and the Philippines is very suitable for Japanese development]," he said.</p>
<p>Regarding the Fujian Incident, Mr. Sun said that Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and even the 19th Route Army were merely occupying Fujian to carry out their political movements, which had nothing to do with the people of Fujian. This was because the 19th Route Army was a Guangdong army, not a local Fujian army. The biggest problem with the Chinese people is their inability to cooperate. The leaders are divided due to regional, historical, and personal feelings, leading to a state of political turmoil. Furthermore, soldiers like to interfere in politics, preventing politics from getting on the right track. It's like a car where the soldiers are the drivers and the people are the passengers. Now, the passengers have no way to order the driver to drive to the destination.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>If the driver drives the car erratically, wouldn't China be in trouble? Regarding the issue of suppressing the communists, Mr. Sun said that the previous methods of suppressing the communists were inappropriate, which is why they failed. Progress has now been made, and the root of the matter is entirely an economic problem. Regarding the issue of resisting Japan, he said that the government is not unwilling to resist Japan, but because China is so internally divided, and everyone is not cooperating, and politics is such a mess, and the country's power is so weak, how can we resist?</p>
<p>That evening, the General Branch of the Kuomintang and the Manila Chinese Chamber of Commerce held a banquet for Mr. Sun and his party at the Great Eastern Hotel, presided over by Consul General Kuang. Chen Sanduo, Chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, described in detail the recent bombings of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou by airplanes, and presented Mr. Sun with a written petition. Mr. Sun immediately read it carefully, looking extremely concerned. The chairman then invited Mr. Sun to give a speech. Mr. Sun said that this was his third time coming to the Philippines and that this time it was purely for travel and did not carry any mission. He felt ashamed to receive such a warm welcome from the overseas Chinese tonight, but he was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet and talk with everyone. The overseas Chinese here are enthusiastic and patriotic, and they are particularly concerned about the Fujian Incident and must be eager to understand it. Therefore, he would like to report to the overseas Chinese what he knows about the recent situation in China. Overseas Chinese have no more than two types of mindsets: one is dissatisfied with the current situation, and the other hopes that in the future, all parties can unite to form a strong and powerful government to turn the tide and improve the country's situation. Both of these mindsets are what patriots should have. Those in authority are often confused, while observers are clear. Moreover, our government is a government of the people, so of course everyone can speak out, so that the government knows where its mistakes are and can follow the path of improvement. Since the success of the Northern Expedition, there has been no achievement in politics in the past twenty-two years, which is undeniable. However, is this kind of mistake due to the fact that the Three Principles of the People are insufficient to save China and are not suitable for China's situation? In my honest opinion, it is not that the Three Principles of the People are insufficient to save China, but that the central government is unable to implement them. Since the success of the Northern Expedition, the party has been divided, and there have been years of civil war. In the past, the campaigns against Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, and even the recent Fujian Incident, had to resort to military force. Moreover, this kind of civil war cannot be blamed solely on the old warlords, nor can it be blamed solely on the central government. The biggest problem is that internal divisions arise and cannot be united. If there is no unity, the power of the central government is weak and it cannot implement policies to seek progress. Now, the central government has sent Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Wang Luyi, and Chen Zhaoying, four people, to contact Hu Hanmin and the southwestern provinces, precisely to seek unity. Hu has been living in Hong Kong for the past two years, and has repeatedly made detailed criticisms and severe accusations of the national government's military and political arrangements. In fact, mere accusations are useless. If everyone can plan for unity, then Nanjing will humbly listen to advice and accept the contributions of the southwest. In short, the way to save the country is for all parties to cooperate sincerely. Hu issued a declaration the other day, putting forward eight propositions, and when I was in Hong Kong, newspaper reporters sought my opinion. Although I have not read the full text, its eight propositions are all suitable for saving the country, and I fully agree with them. Mr. Sun also said that Hu Hanmin advocates resisting Japan, and the words "resisting Japan" should be agreed upon by the entire nation. However, in order to implement it, we must first think about how to do it. If we want to gather the national army and go to the Northeast, and make a desperate gamble, it would be too risky. Therefore, we must first strengthen the country's power, and then be prepared for war. Appropriately, the Chamber of Commerce requested to relay a telegram to prevent the bombing of southern Fujian. When this matter first happened, I was still in Nanjing and received telegrams from various places, requesting a halt. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had also instructed the air force to pay attention and not to indiscriminately bomb civilians. As for the second time, I don't know. The Chamber of Commerce represents the opinions of all overseas Chinese, and I will immediately relay this intention to the central military authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e64">### The Sichuan Army Recaptures Yilong and Qianjiang <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>丨丨Remnant Bandits on the Border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Flee to Southern Henan 丨丨</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the Sichuan bandit suppression army recovered Sui and Xuan, the military center of gravity has shifted to Yilong. Tian Songyao, the commander of the Second Route Army, also generously took on the responsibility of recovering Yilong after Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly urged him to fight. According to reports, the Li Weiruyi unit of the right wing army of this route recovered Yicheng on the 1st of this month. The remaining forces of Xu Xiangqian retreated to Tongjiang and Bazhong. He Long's bandit forces entered Sichuan and colluded with the Lianyinghui bandits to capture the county seat of Qianjiang in eastern Sichuan, and repeatedly committed westward offenses, attempting to join forces with the Xu bandits. The militia fought hard to resist, but failed. Recently, due to the defeat and retreat of the Xu bandits, their momentum has become even more isolated. Liu Xiang, the commander-in-chief of the Sichuan bandit suppression, specially transferred the Peng brigade of the First Division and the Da brigade of the First Division to take the opportunity to attack and suppress them, and also recovered Qiancheng on the 1st. According to a telegram from Liu Xiang, the bandits are now fleeing to Daluba and Longping, and he is ordering various units to pursue and suppress them. The crisis in Sichuan has been slightly eased as a result.</p>
<p>The remnant bandits on the border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui are now few and far between. Liu Zhenhua, the commander-in-chief, telegraphed on the 4th, saying that they are all fleeing into Gushi, southern Henan. The 65th Division of Liu Maoen and the 45th Division of Dai Minquan have been ordered to encircle and suppress them, and have repeatedly won victories. Liu's unit killed the false brigade commander Li Furen and the false regimental commander Lang Zefu. Dai's unit recovered Wulongji, Huolonggang, Caomiaoji, Quhe, Quanhepu, and Zhangguangmiao, and pursued the bandits to Jianshan. A unit of the false 82nd Division, entrenched in Zhanglaobu, Dafoshan, and Yanling, was also defeated by the Tan brigade of this division. The following is Dai Minquan's victory telegram: "[According to a telegram from Brigade Commander Tan, the bandits who disturbed Zhanglaobu plundered grain yesterday morning and fled successively to Yingheji and Yangjiaji in the south. At the same time, the bandits entrenched in Dacha Shop collected kerosene and firewood, claiming to burn down the bridges on the highway, and transported grain and grass to Peijiachong in the south. The bandits at Qingfengling were withdrawn to Dafoshan and Yanling to guard against our army's pursuit. According to reports, I ordered Yang's regiment at Wumiao Ji, Chen's camp at Suxianshi, and Zhu's camp at Zaoxiehe to intercept them in different directions, and engaged in mixed battles with the bandits at Wangjialou, Suokou, Yanling, and Peijiachong. Our Zhu's camp launched a fierce attack on the bandits at Yanling, engaging in hand-to-hand combat and charging, and occupied Yanling. The bandits fled to Yiyuan Temple, and the remaining bandits wavered and fled in different directions to Changjiang River and Shimenkou. Our Yang's regiment and Zhu's camp tracked them to Yangjiaji Yiyuan Temple. Due to the late hour and rain, each returned to its original defense. An inspection of the abandoned bandit corpses revealed one false 82nd Division regimental commander, Li Tengxiao, and 91 guns and dozens of bags of grain were seized. It is believed that the bandits have been exhausted after this attack. Our special suppression units should take advantage of their lack of breath to quickly suppress them. It is expected that it will not be difficult to annihilate them. I respectfully report this, Dai Minquan, [seal]," (January 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">### Stability in the Recovered Bandit Areas of Hubei Province <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Regulations for Rent and Debt Relief Announced Widely</p>
<p>Issuance of Financial Bonds to Implement Economic Construction</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, believes that the people in the recovered bandit areas have suffered greatly from the bandits for a long time, and are in extreme pain. They have no time to save the dead, and it is inevitable that they will be unable to pay rent and repay debts. In order to seek stability, he specially followed the principles instructed by Chiang Kai-shek and stipulated two measures as follows: (1) In all newly recovered bandit areas of various counties, the rice and grain of the 22nd year will all be harvested by the tenant farmers who planted them. (2) Regardless of new or old debts, they will all be extended to after the autumn harvest of the 23rd year for settlement. An order was issued on the 4th, and landlords and creditors were notified of the general situation, urging them not to violate the order and demand repayment, causing disturbances. In addition, in order to seek economic construction, Zhang plans to implement a plan starting this year. The largest amount of money is needed for sorting out the debt of armor, recovering the official property of Shengcheng Lane. The provincial treasury does not have this financial capacity, so it was decided to issue financial bonds of 4 million yuan, to be used for distribution. The rental income of public property in the province and the dividend of the provincial bank will be used as the principal and interest repayment fund. If there is a shortfall, it will be allocated from the business tax and submitted to the provincial bank for storage on a monthly basis. The face value is divided into 10,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, and 10 yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and the principal and interest will be repaid every six months, and all will be repaid in twelve years. This bond can be issued after it is passed by the Legislative Yuan and approved by the General Headquarters. (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">### Decline of Guangdong's Commerce in the Past Year <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Trade Plummeted</p>
<p>Inland Industry and Commerce Suffered Losses and Decline</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The commerce of Guangdong Province throughout the 22nd year showed a state of decline, which was unprecedented in decades. The general situation of various industries in the past year is briefly described as follows: (1) Foreign Trade: Shunde and Nanhai counties in Guangdong Province have always been known for their large-scale exports of raw silk. Last year, the export volume decreased sharply. In previous years, the monthly export volume was always above 7,000 packages, but last year, the monthly export volume was only more than 1,000 packages. At the same time, silk prices plummeted. Normally, the price of silk per dan (100 catties) is about 1,000 yuan, but last year, the price fell to 500 yuan, or even 300 yuan. Hundreds of thousands of male and female silk reeling workers in Shunde lost their jobs. The export volume of other products such as tea, tobacco, silk scarves, Gu embroidery, ivory utensils, and jade objects also plummeted. As for imported goods, Guangdong Province used to be a major sales market for foreign goods. Recently, due to the increase in tariffs, the prices of foreign cloth and wool are still high, and people's purchasing power has decreased. Therefore, more than a dozen large cloth shops went bankrupt last year. (2) Inland Commerce: The prosperity of Guangzhou City has always been measured by the development of the silver industry. However, last year, the silver industry in Guangzhou almost completely collapsed. The reasons are: first, the silk industry declined, and there were no loan opportunities; second, the business of various Jiang groceries shops (commonly known as the Sanjiang Gang) declined, and there was very little mortgage lending to silver shops; third, it was affected by the trend of low and falling paper money; fourth, the rich have weak faith in silver shops and dare not deposit money, only withdraw money, especially when the paper money trend occurred. Last year, the silver industry was greatly affected by the above factors, so more than 70 large and small silver shops went bankrupt, owing a total of more than 6 million yuan to outsiders. Fortunately, in November, the government announced restrictions on depositors' withdrawals, and those who had not received benefits were able to barely survive, but they were also heavily indebted. As for the rice industry, last year, due to the continuous decline in the price of foreign rice, and the once imposed tax on foreign rice, the entire industry suffered losses. The losses of rice shops were 200,000 to 300,000 yuan for the large ones, and more than 100,000 yuan for the upper ones. The situation of decline was unprecedented in the past 30 years. As for the Sanjiang Gang, such as the miscellaneous grain shops, rice and sugar shops, sugar and flour shops, and oil and bean shops, they were affected by the decline of various industries, and also faced the Taikoo Wheel strike. The losses of various industries were no less than 1 million yuan, and the number of shops that suffered losses reached nine out of ten. In recent years, real estate construction in Guangzhou has been prosperous for a while, and many speculators have become rich. Unexpectedly, since the second half of last year, changes have occurred in the financial world, and funds have been short. Almost no one is interested in buildings. At the same time, building materials such as bricks, tiles, wood, stone, and cement have all fallen in price, and property prices have also fallen by 40% compared to normal times. The real estate companies' existing properties cannot be sold, and the losses can be imagined. Since society is so depressed, emerging industries have also been greatly affected. The native cloth woven in the interior was sold to the Nanyang area, but last year, the Nanyang business had not yet recovered, and the purchasing power of the people in the interior was weak. Therefore, dozens of native cloth weaving factories went bankrupt, and more than 5,000 male and female workers lost their jobs. In addition, more than half of the upper-made match factories also went bankrupt, and only 18 are left, with a 50% reduction in output. The native-made kerosene factories are squeezed out by foreign merchants, and only dozens are left, compared to more than 150 at the peak, only one-third are left and weak. In recent years, although the government and people's organizations have actively promoted the use of domestic goods, the silk industry could have taken the opportunity to flourish, but the people's livelihood is difficult and they cannot afford to buy them. Therefore, more than a dozen silk shops in Guangzhou also went bankrupt last year, and only one in a hundred can make a profit. (January 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e67">### Jiaoji Railway's Profit Last Year Was 4 Million Yuan <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, is currently meeting with Han Fuju, chairman of the provincial government, for business. He took the Jiaoji Railway's 5th train west this morning (3rd) and arrived in Jinan at 6 pm. At the same time, Shi Han, director of the railway police department, also came to Jinan. Chairman Han Fuju and Mayor Wen Chenglie both welcomed him at the station. After getting off the train, Ge and Han went to Jinan Hotel to rest. According to Ge, the operating conditions of the Jiaoji Railway last year were not bad. According to the year-end settlement results last year, there was a surplus of more than 5 million this year. After repaying the Japanese debt of 1.2 million, there was still a surplus of more than 4 million. This number is not easy to obtain, and it may be difficult to repeat this in the future. This is because the sales of various local products in Qingdao are sluggish, freight volume has decreased, and income has been greatly affected. At present, peanuts are piled up everywhere, but they cannot be sold. The previous selling price was 13 or 14 yuan per 100 catties, but now it has fallen to about 4 yuan. In addition, tobacco leaves have also fallen in price. In total, tobacco farmers suffered losses of more than 10 million last year, etc. (3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e68">### Shandong Coal Industry Organizes Production and Sales Company <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Intended to Rescue the Coal Industry</p>
<p>Government Sends Personnel for Guidance</p>
<p>Boshan Correspondence: Shandong is extremely rich in coal reserves. For more than ten years, it has occupied the center of gravity of China's coal production, especially Boshan. There are as many as twenty coal mining companies. In addition to supplying fuel to the province, it is also transported to Shanghai, Fujian, Guangdong, and the Yangtze River Basin, occupying the most important position in the province's export goods. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese seized the coal mines in the Northeast, worked hard to exploit them, and dumped them everywhere. The domestic coal industry was greatly affected. Because foreign coal is sold at low prices, the cost of producing coal in this province is very high, and it cannot compete with it. The sales channels have been almost completely taken away. Even those who reluctantly sell it all bear the pain and lose money. The coal mining industry is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the local economy is declining as a result. Qingdao's exports are stagnant, and the market is also deserted due to the coldness of the wharf. Shen Honglie, the mayor of Qingdao, has noticed this and has specially consulted with the Shandong Provincial Government to discuss rescue methods. Zhang Honglie, director of the Department of Construction, has therefore gone to Qingdao to discuss methods with Mayor Shen and coal miners. The general opinion is to form a cooperative organization by coal miners to classify coal quality, grade it, and set prices in order to gain credibility and facilitate sales. This company is entirely organized by the business side. The government only sends personnel to provide guidance and supervision, and sets a deadline of one month to complete the organization. Major coal mining companies will meet in Boshan in the coming days to discuss organizational methods, and the provincial government and the municipal government will each send two people to Boshan to participate in the meeting in order to explain the meaning of organizing cooperation. It is purely to rescue the coal industry and the local economy, so as not to let the business side misunderstand that the government has other intentions. The provincial government has appointed Yu Wuheng, a technician from the Department of Construction, and Huang Yongtai, director of the Second Mining Bureau. The Qingdao Municipal Government has appointed Dong Zhidao, chief of the second section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Ke Yuan Chuan Gentian. The four people arrived in Boshan yesterday (29th) and contacted the business side. The business side has decided to appoint Ding Jingchen, manager of Yuesheng Coal Mining Company, Liang Xisan, manager of Yonghe Coal Mining Company, and Yu Zijing, manager of Dongfang Coal Company as representatives to discuss organizational methods. Except for Liang Xisan of Yonghe Company, who is currently in Qingdao and has not yet arrived in Boshan, the others are all in Boshan. As soon as Liang Xisan arrives in Boshan, a formal meeting will be held to discuss it.</p>
<p>According to sources from the mining industry, Mayor Shen had already discussed the matter of organizing a cooperative company in the spring of the 22nd year, and entrusted Ding Jingchen, manager of Yuesheng Company, to draft an outline of the organization and solicit opinions from various colleagues. At that time, all companies expressed sympathy for this kind of organization, but many believed that the event was too large and the organization was not easy, so it was put on hold. Now that the government has taken the lead, most businessmen and people feel grateful. However, there are a few companies that do not want this organization under the conditions of personal interests due to their own special circumstances, but the number of this kind of company is very small and there is not much resistance. The government is quite determined. If the merchants themselves cannot organize it, they will organize it with the power of the government, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, when Ding Jingchen first proposed cooperation, he compiled the origin and general outline of the convention and printed and distributed it to colleagues. The origin states four benefits: (1) A unified agency can save expenses; (2) Unified goods can improve foreign credibility; (3) Due to the adjustment of goods, joint research and improvement can be carried out; (4) Small capital miners can obtain an equal position. The main points of its covenants are as follows: (1) Miners who join the cooperation should deliver all the coal produced to the cooperative company for joint sales; (2) The coal produced by each mine should be analyzed for its composition and use by the Coal Quality Inspection Committee to determine its grade; (3) All coal produced by the cooperative mines should be sold by the cooperative company as a sales agency. All foreign sales should be managed by the cooperative company; (4) The cooperative company should take the same industry association as the supreme authority; (5) Persons with good reputation should be elected by the same industry association as supervisors and concurrently serve as standing members of the Supervisory Committee, with the power to supervise and guide.

<p>Tax Police Team Cracks Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the 15th District, which belongs to Hujiaqiao in this county, recently had bandits setting up an organization and hiding hostages. After 8 people reported it to the Caoxing Tax Police Team, the team was dispatched there. A bandit named Luo Zhaofa, who was watching the ticket, was arrested, and a ticket watcher named Peng Lv was arrested. In addition, a hostage named Dan Yunxu and Shan Yuyong Feng Meiying was rescued. After interrogation, the case was transferred to the Nanqiao District Department for disposal. After detailed interrogation, since the case was related to kidnapping and the location was in Songxian County, the people were brought to the county court for trial.</p>

<p>Japanese Come to Jiading Without Permits</p>
<p>On New Year's Day morning, seven Japanese people, including Hiraji Jiro, led by Bai Xuefu from Gaoyou, Jiangsu, came to Jiading from Shanghai by car, carrying firearms and cameras. They wanted to call a car to Longzhen. The police were dispatched by the County Public Security Bureau to negotiate, seeking protection. The Japanese could not respond. Yao then stopped them tactfully. Yao then led the police to accompany them to visit the north gate for a week. The Japanese returned to Shanghai at 7 pm that afternoon. Although the Japanese seemed to be merchants, they were very familiar with the geography of the county. It is feared that they had participated in the Japanese invasion a few years ago and may have political effects. Regarding the matter of foreigners entering the inland without permits, County Magistrate Feng will report the situation to the provincial government by telegram.</p>

<p>Widening of Two Streets to Be Completed Soon</p>
<p>After the Municipal Engineering Office actively carried out the widening of the section of the street from Nan Diaobiao to Daigouqiao, the houses in the area have been taken in accordance with the regulations. Now the street is being paved and will be completed soon. Then, bidding will be invited to contract the reconstruction of the Daigouqiao project. In addition, although a few residents opposed the widening of Xiatang Street, County Magistrate Yan insisted that it was necessary and ordered the technical office to actively handle it. It was specially proposed for discussion at the county political meeting last time, and a resolution was passed. Construction will start immediately. County Magistrate Yan issued a notice to the residents in the area, limiting them to demolish and yield voluntarily from January 1st to the end of February. Otherwise, it will be enforced. Now the residents in the area have voluntarily demolished and yielded their houses. It is estimated that the entire project will be completed by the middle of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Pirates Rob Overnight Boat <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>There is usually a night boat between Sigang in Jiangyin and Beizhakou in this county, and the boatman is named Lu Furong. The boat left Sigang for Xitong the night before last. At midnight, it suddenly encountered a pirate boat near Baituqiao at the junction of Xideng. There were seven pirates on board, one of whom was armed with a firearm. The pirate got on the boat first, and the remaining pirates boarded the boat one after another and arbitrarily searched it for half an hour. After robbing, the pirates jumped back to their original boat, rowed away. After checking the losses, it was found that the shops had been robbed of 117 yuan in goods, 15,000 copper coins, and more than 200 yuan in cash, earrings, and other items from more than 30 male and female passengers. Boatman Lu Furong submitted a loss report to the county government yesterday, requesting the arrest of the pirates and legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Agricultural and Mining Products Exhibition Open</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Province Agricultural and Mining Products Exhibition Hall was established during the era of the former Agricultural and Mining Office. Over the years, a considerable amount of money has been spent. The collection of various agricultural and mining products inside is quite comprehensive. All kinds of fish specimens are particularly spectacular. However, during the era of the former Department of Industry, due to financial difficulties, the exhibition hall was closed and entrusted to the Farmers Bank for safekeeping. After Director Shen of the Department of Construction took office, considering that the various products in the hall were sealed indoors and outsiders could not view them, which was a great pity, he decided to continue to open the hall. The interior of the hall has now been completely renovated and officially opened yesterday. The viewing hours are from 8:15 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:15 PM every day. On holidays, the morning session is closed, but the afternoon session is open as usual. It is said that the hall will continue to collect various agricultural and mining products from various places in order to make it more complete.</p>

<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, since Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet of the Navy, departed for Sandu on a [unclear] gunboat, rumors have spread that the war situation has become tense. Yesterday, reporters inquired with the navy in this port. It was said that there were indeed three regiments of the Fujian army, led by Qiu Zhaochen, stationed in Luoyuan. In fact, Luoyuan is located near Sandu Bay, and Qiu's troops are still west of Luoyuan and have not advanced towards Luoyuan. Commander Chen is still stationed in Sandu and has not moved. Although it was once rumored that Commander Li Mengbin had arrived at Changmen, his whereabouts are still unknown. Commander Wang (Shouting) travels back and forth between Fujian and Xiamen waters on a [unclear] ship, patrolling the area, so his whereabouts are also uncertain.</p>

<p>Taiqing Telegraph Remains Open</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, before the Fujian Incident, the wired telegraph between Shanghai and Fujian was quite congested due to commercial relations, with daily business telegrams coming and going. Although it gradually decreased after the realization of the Fujian Incident, it was still able to maintain its original state. However, since December 29 of last year, due to the impact of the war, the wired telegraph has been interrupted. Fortunately, the Fuzhou and Xiamen radio stations and the Shanghai radio station are still reporting as usual, so the telecommunications traffic between Shanghai and Fujian can be maintained. However, in recent days, there have been very few commercial telegrams between Shanghai and Fujian.</p>
<p>According to the Eurasia News Agency, yesterday, news from the local transportation authorities said that the wired telegraph in the Taishun and Qingyuan areas has been open since the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau still received and sent telegrams to these two places as usual. This proves that the Fujian army has retreated to the Shouning area. However, telegrams from Shanghai to Fuzhou cannot be sent due to other problems, but this is not related to the war.</p>

<p>From Now on, Everything Will Be Under the Command of the Central Government</p>
<p>Daring to Face Fire and Boiling Water, How Could We Lag Behind?</p>
<p>The Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, the Sanshan Guild Hall, and other organizations received a circular telegram from Chen Qixuan, the commander of the First Brigade of the Fujian Security Force, announcing his return to righteousness. The original text is as follows: Central Party Headquarters, National Government, all Yuan and Departments, Chairman Chiang, Your Excellencies, All Party Headquarters, All Provincial Governments, All Pacification Commissioners, Commanders-in-Chief, and all Army, Division, and Brigade Commanders, all Social Organizations and Newspapers, Shanghai Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association, and forward to all Fellow-Provincials Associations for public knowledge: This time, the two rebels, Li and Chen, initiated chaos in Fujian, bewitching farmers and workers, and betraying the Party and the country. At a time when strong neighbors are pressing us and the Red bandits are rampant, and the energy of the entire nation and country should be used to pacify internally and externally, I fear it is not enough, but they are using local public opinion as a pretext to seize a corner, placing the country in danger of disintegration and the people in the suffering of displacement. To speak of saving the country in this way is tantamount to wanting to destroy it together. Our brigade was originally stationed in Gejian for many years. At the beginning of the incident, we were forced to reorganize. The officers and soldiers were filled with righteous indignation and had long thought of extricating themselves. However, the troops were stationed in various places within the sphere of influence of the rebel army, and the surveillance was extremely strict, so there was no way to change. Now that the righteous army is pointing south, the rebels are shivering. Qixuan led his troops to risk escape, not hesitating to sacrifice everything, and broke through the rebel army's defense line from a roundabout route. We have assembled our troops in Shouning County on the [unclear] day of the month. From now on, we will obey the Central Government and participate in the suppression of the rebellion, with the sole aim of saving the Party and protecting the country. Although we may face fire and boiling water, how could we lag behind? Our humble sincerity, we humbly ask for your consideration. Chen Qixuan, commander of the First Brigade of the Fujian Security Force, and all officers and soldiers kowtow together, East.</p>
<h3 id="e88">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyan Steamer Ordered to Resume Sailing to Wenzhou <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The First Sailing is Scheduled for the 9th of This Month</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyan steamer was ordered to suspend its service after opening the Ruian and Pingyang routes, causing various ships in Nanshi to avoid it. After half a year, the Ruiping route has been temporarily shelved. The Haiyan steamer has undergone major repairs and has applied to the Ministry of Communications to resume its service. It has now received approval and is allowed to resume the Wenzhou service. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e89">Reasons for the Suspension of the Haiyan Service <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Although the Haiyan steamer is over forty years old, it seems to have lost its qualification to sail according to regulations. However, its steel plates, machinery, and engines are better than any other seagoing vessel. Even newly built ships cannot compare. Last time, the various public organizations in Wenzhou and Yongjia telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to attack it, resulting in its suspension for more than half a year. The company sent Jiahe to sail to Wenzhou in its place.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Completion of Dock Repairs <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The authorities of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, considering that the Haiyan steamer had an excellent hull, could not bear to abandon it. Therefore, after the suspension of the service, the shipping department discussed thoroughly repairing the ship. All the internal components and steel plates were replaced if they were not up to standard. The passenger seats were improved and the cabins were renovated. During the major repairs, the technical department of the Maritime Administration Bureau was repeatedly invited to send personnel to the ship to inspect it in order to comply with the regulations. It was not until now that the work was completed. The whole ship has been completely renewed. Even newly built seagoing vessels are not as strong and complete.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Ministry of Communications Approves Resumption of Service <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>When the Haiyan was about to be repaired, the company reported to the Ministry of Communications, requesting that it be allowed to resume the Shanghai-Wenzhou route to facilitate travel for passengers. The Haiyan steamer has extremely strong speed and can reach Wenzhou from Shanghai in only twenty-eight hours. It is the most popular among passengers on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route. After the suspension of the service, the Wenzhou community also repeatedly requested the resumption of the service. Now that the Ministry of Communications has approved that the Haiyan has been thoroughly repaired and has been inspected by the Maritime Administration Bureau and found to be qualified, it is allowed to resume service and still sail to Wenzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e92">First Sailing Scheduled for the 9th <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the order from the Ministry, the company has been preparing for the resumption of the service for days. At this time, due to the situation in Wenzhou, passengers taking ships to Shanghai are very crowded. Therefore, it has been agreed that the service to Wenzhou will be resumed on the 9th of this month. However, the new routes to Ruian and Pingyang, which were previously planned, have been temporarily suspended due to the Fujian Incident. Passenger and freight services to Ruiping have long been suspended, and the market has been hit by military operations. The Shanghai-Wenzhou route will still be served by Haiyan and Guangji.</p>

<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong line aircraft flew back to Longhua Airport at noon yesterday. In addition to passengers from Guangzhou to Fuzhou, there was only one passenger from Guangdong to Shanghai. At present, the war between Zhejiang and Fujian is becoming increasingly fierce, but when the aircraft passed over Fuzhou the night before, the situation in the provincial capital did not appear to be tense.</p>
<p>The company's No. 11 aircraft, which is test-flying the South China line, still had not received any telegram from Yunnan yesterday, according to the company.</p>

However, according to the company's news yesterday morning, the通航 between Lanzhou and Hami has been temporarily postponed again due to some reason. It is difficult to predict when it will open. However, a large number of accumulated mails in Lanzhou urgently need to be transported to Dihua as soon as possible. If it still cannot fly to Dihua by the 18th of this month, it is planned to transport it back to Shanghai by ship via Russia.</p>

<p>The eighth redemption of the Financial Short-Term Bonds of the Republic of China, 20th Year, and the fourteenth redemption of the Military Reduction Bonds of the Republic of China, 18th Year, were held at 10:00 AM yesterday morning in the auditorium of the Banking Association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. Three lottery tickets were drawn, for a total redemption of 660,000 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e96">Representatives in Attendance <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>

<h3 id="e97">Chairman's Report <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Zheng Lai, Director of the Public Debt Department, reported: Today is the date for drawing lottery tickets for the eighth redemption of the Financial Short-Term Bonds of the Republic of China, 20th Year, and the fourteenth redemption of the Military Reduction Bonds of the Republic of China, 18th Year. I am very pleased that you have all come to attend and observe. The total amount of the Financial Short-Term Bonds of the Republic of China, 20th Year, issued was 80 million yuan. In addition to the first to seventh redemptions of principal and interest, this is the eighth redemption of principal and interest, with two lottery tickets drawn, each for 80,000 yuan, for a total of 160,000 yuan, which is two-tenths of the total amount of the bonds issued. Therefore, the method of drawing lottery tickets must use the same three digits at the end of the number as the winning bonds. The total amount of the Military Reduction Bonds of the Republic of China, 18th Year, issued was 50 million yuan. In addition to the first to thirteenth redemptions of principal and interest, this is the fourteenth redemption of principal and interest, with one lottery ticket drawn, for a total of 500,000 yuan, which is one percent of the total amount of the bonds issued. Therefore, the method of drawing lottery tickets still uses the same two digits at the end of the number as the winning bonds. The principal and interest of the aforementioned two types of winning bonds, the Financial Short-Term Bonds of the Republic of China, 20th Year, will be paid by the Central, China, and Communications banks, along with the interest due, from the 15th of this month; and the Military Reduction Bonds of the Republic of China, 18th Year, will be paid from the 31st of this month. No matter where, the national currency will be paid. Please ask the supervisor to check the lottery tickets and the bottom book of the lottery tickets for execution of the lottery drawing.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Winning Numbers <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, the supervisor checked the lottery tickets and the bottom book. The lottery drawers executed the drawing. All winning numbers were checked by the chairman and verified by the supervisor to be correct, and were announced on a suspended sign. At the same time, the registrars registered them, and the supervisor added a seal to the bottom book as proof. The winning numbers are recorded below: (1) Two Financial Short-Term Bonds of the Republic of China, 20th Year: [No. 645] [No. 959]; (2) One Military Reduction Bond of the Republic of China, 18th Year: [No. 22]; for a total redemption of 660,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Municipal Authorities Seek to Restore the Prosperity of Zhabei <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Payment of Land Value Tax is Enthusiastic After Collection Begins</p>
<p>Other Districts are Also Preparing to Proceed</p>
<p>Since the land value tax in this city was levied on the 21st of last month, the Zhabei and Nanshi collection offices of the Finance Bureau have seen a very enthusiastic response from those who have gone to pay in accordance with the regulations in the past half month. At the same time, other districts are also preparing to collect the tax. The situation as expressed by the person in charge of the Finance Bureau is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e100">Enthusiastic Payment <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>It is said that since the land value tax in the seven districts of the north and south of this city was officially levied on the 21st of last month, citizens in each district have successively gone to the Land Bureau to verify their forms, and then transferred to the Nanshi and Zhabei collection offices to pay according to the price. In the second and third districts of Zhabei, there are more than forty cases of people paying according to the forms every day, and the situation is very enthusiastic. This is because the collection tax forms set for this land value tax collection are actually not much different from the grain tax, so the total revenue in the future should also be reduced by half compared to the initial budget, at most about 500,000 yuan. However, since the citizens are very enthusiastic about paying, there will be some increase in the city's finances.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Increased Area <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>It is also said that the area being collected this time is only the seven districts that have already been measured by the Land Bureau, which will be collected first. Other districts are being delayed because the measurement has not been completed. Now the municipal government, in order to increase the city's finances and for the sake of covering the entire area, is still planning to continue the process. Now the Land Bureau has started measuring, and once the procedures are completed, the collection can be officially started.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Reviving Zhabei <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Also, Zhabei Baoshan Road, which is adjacent to the various roads in the eastern district of the concession, has been destroyed by fierce artillery fire and bombs since the January 28th Songhu War two years ago. Although some of the buildings have been gradually rebuilt and restored, the area above Baoshan Road is still a pile of rubble and has not been restored to this day. The prosperity of Zhabei City and the revenue of the city's finances have been greatly affected. Taking Zhabei's tax revenue as an example, the total revenue per year is always more than 25% different between before January 28th and the year after the war. This city is now working hard on the construction of the city center, and at the same time, it is paying close attention to the restoration and prosperity of Zhabei City. Therefore, in a short period of time, it will try its best to find ways to carry out the construction of the remaining sites in the war zone.</p>

The land in the area was valued and distributed by the municipal government at 3,000 yuan per mu.

In general, in addition to reporting on the recent situation of Sichuan's construction, they also hoped that people from all regions and the news media could send people to inspect, report the true situation to colleagues, in order to jointly invest in Sichuan, develop the rich resources, and implement construction, so that the future Sichuan will realize the ancient saying of "When the world is in chaos, Sichuan is not; when the world is governed, Sichuan is governed first." They also used the rapid development of the Minsheng Company, which is run by Sichuan, as an example. For example, the number of ships has increased from three or four to dozens, and the capital has increased from thousands to millions. Human effort can make anything possible, and if it is done with perseverance, it will surely succeed.

<p>Must Take Into Account the Interests of Farmers</p>
<p>More than fifty villagers, including Yin Fugen, from Yuansha, Lujiage area, Jiangwan District, submitted a petition through the Municipal Committee member of that district to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, requesting that an order be issued to stop the contractor from dismantling the dikes and illegally occupying farmland, which was impeding agricultural fields, during the dredging of the Qiujiang River. This case has been reported previously. However, since the case occurred, it has not been resolved for many days. Now, according to the Municipal Committee member of that district, Gu Shanzhang, after this case was submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, he (Gu) personally presented the details to Director Shen Yi. Director Shen Yi stated that the high dikes on both banks were originally for flood prevention, and the Bureau of Public Works would never demolish them. He asked the villagers not to worry too much. As for the high soil inside the dikes on both banks, if it is necessary to take it, the Bureau of Public Works will provide a subsidy of thirty yuan per mu. It is planned to send personnel to measure the land starting from the fourth of this month in order to issue the subsidies. If any landowners in the area do not want to give up the soil, they can apply for exemption. If the soil taken is not enough, the river will be dredged more widely to deepen it. In this way, both farmland and water conservancy will be greatly facilitated, he said.</p>

<p>Since the City Government moved from its original site at Fenglin Bridge to the new building in the city center, the old site was originally intended to be allocated to the Municipal Health Bureau to establish a hospital. However, due to budget constraints and the fact that the buildings were not very suitable, this proposal was temporarily shelved. On the other hand, the City Party Headquarters found that its existing buildings were not very suitable for office work and had long considered selecting a more suitable building to move to. Recently, after the City Government moved, the City Party Headquarters consulted with the City Government several times and decided to use the original site of the City Government as the City Party Headquarters' office.

<p>The National Coal Relief Committee stated that the Tax Administration ordered all mining merchants to submit the original tax certificates and other documents when applying for a refund of the customs re-export tax, and that the refund would only be valid within three months after the tax was paid. It was also found that the original tax certificates of the mining merchants must be exchanged for distribution lists at any time and transported with the goods for inspection by customs checkpoints along the way. If the goods are not sold, the lists are difficult to recover. If the original tax certificates or distribution lists must be submitted within a time limit in order to obtain a tax refund, the re-export tax paid will never be refunded. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Tax Administration requesting that the usual practice be maintained or that a flexible method be adopted to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The Administration replied, stating that in the future, when various mining companies declare goods and pay re-export taxes, the companies should immediately copy the number of the original tax certificate, the shipping manifest, the quantity of goods, the tax amount, and the date of issuance on the back of the customs re-export tax receipt. When applying for a tax refund in the future, this receipt will be submitted for verification. If it matches, the tax will be refunded in full as a matter of accommodation and consideration. It is reported that the Committee has forwarded the original text to the mining merchants for their information and implementation.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance of the National Government sent personnel to various banks in Shanghai in September of the 19th year to investigate their operations.

The Ministry believes that savings business is extremely important for the livelihood of ordinary people and social finance. Although the banks operating concurrently have stipulated the separation of capital and independent accounting in their articles of association, it is necessary to send personnel to conduct on-site investigations to determine whether there are cleverly disguised items in the acceptance of various savings deposits and whether the operation of the savings is in full compliance with the approved articles of association. Therefore, the Ministry has specially dispatched Section Chief Dai Mingli, along with Section Members Qian Zhaohe and Xie Guoci, to Shanghai to handle savings at various banks in the area. They will inspect the assets and liabilities of the savings departments one by one, compile detailed reports to clarify the true situation of each bank. It is now reported that Dai and others have already gone to the banks to start the investigation.</p>

<p>Dongming, Changyuan, Funing, Shunyi, Pingshi, West Shandong, Sichuan This year (Year 22), war and floods have swept across several provinces in North China, affecting a vast area and a large number of victims. To this day, they are still wearing single layers, lacking food, and sleeping in the open air. At this time of severe winter, relief is urgently needed. The World Red Swastika Society, in addition to setting up a porridge factory in the east and west cities as usual and providing cotton clothing for distribution to aid the poor in Pingnei, considers the situation in the areas most severely affected by the disaster in China and the suffering of the victims to be extremely pitiful. In this severe winter, it is necessary to make preparations for another winter relief effort after being exhausted. A month ago, the Society convened meetings of the northern and southern associations to discuss winter relief matters and fundraising methods in the disaster areas. All members of the associations felt that although they were exhausted from expanding relief efforts this year, they should continue to work hard for winter relief in any case in order to relieve the disaster and help those in need. It is now learned that the funds pledged by the various associations have not yet been fully remitted.

<h3 id="e133">Shanghai National Products Company Introduces National Products to the Women's Sector <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Encouraging Employees to Work Hard to Meet Commercial Warfare</p>
<p>Creating Facts to Assist Production and Sales Companies</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Company, located across from the Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road, is the earliest and most active national products company established on Nanjing Road. Now, because the company will hold a special discount campaign from tomorrow onwards, with all goods at 10% off or special prices, it will also introduce excellent national products to women at different times and in different departments, so that women can know that national products are cheaper than foreign products in price, and that national products are of superior quality and more durable than foreign products. For example, today's discounted products include printed woolen cloth at 2 jiao per foot in the silk and satin department, our brand thermos flasks at 2 yuan per piece, national product hot water bags at 8 jiao to 1.2 yuan per piece, Yongda stoves at 18.5 yuan per piece, striped woolen cloth at 2 zhang per yuan, first-class thick sanitary shirts at 7 jiao per piece in the knitwear department, Shoumu brand dance socks at 4 pairs per yuan, and dotted woolen modern coats at 4.5 yuan per piece. This price is truly an unprecedented sacrifice, regardless of cost. The purpose is to introduce national products to women for trial use and to create a concept of using national products. After 9 PM last night, Lu Qisheng, chairman of the Business Development Committee, convened a meeting of all male and female employees and listened to a speech by Ren Jinping, a design committee member. The main purpose was to encourage employees to boost their commercial warfare spirit in order to create a fact that promoting national products can be profitable. The words of the two gentlemen are attached below to commend the company's attention to the Women's National Products Year and its spirit of fighting for national products.</p>
<p>Lu Qisheng said, "This year is the Women's National Products Year. Women must be responsible for buying more national products, and national products companies must be responsible for creating a psychology that women love to use national products. Our company is aware of this responsibility, so from tomorrow onwards, regardless of cost, we will hold a special discount campaign at different times and in different departments, using the method of discounted prices to introduce national products to women for trial use. However, the discount method is to prevent overcrowding and to show some restrictions. There are departmental regulations. All employees must be aware of the prices of what is discounted at what time in which department. Please show your diligence and provide detailed introductions and explanations to customers." He also said, "When we promote national products, we must compete with foreigners with a spirit of service and not let customers only know that foreigners can provide diligent service. We must also imprint the spirit of our company's employees' patriotism and diligent service in the minds of customers. If this work can be effective, it can directly assist the company in developing its business and indirectly assist factories in production and stabilize the lives of our compatriots in the industrial sector."</p>
<p>Ren Jinping said, "Our efforts to promote national products are aimed at developing production, stabilizing people's livelihoods, and building national strength. However, we must also understand that Japanese goods are the hypothetical enemy of national products. Therefore, while striving to promote national products, we must persuade people not to buy Japanese goods. Furthermore, as Mr. Qisheng said, we must use a spirit of diligent service to help the company's business development and ensure that the total monthly business volume this year is compared with the total monthly business volume last year. There is special progress month by month to show the results of your efforts for the company and for national products. Not only that, but we must make further efforts to make the environment for promoting national products this year more progressive than last year. Our company was founded in November two years ago. Those who followed our company last year include the China National Products Company, the National Products Discount Market, and the Central National Products United Department Store. The opening of three major companies is a national products market. This is one impact of your efforts to promote national products on the environment and also a kind of achievement of the National Products Year. This year is the Women's National Products Year. Be sure to make the statistics of national products stores next year today increase tenfold to a hundredfold compared with last year. Mr. Wu Zhihao, the general manager of our company, is recently engaged in the establishment of the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Company. The first plan set by the company is to promote the organization of sales stores and create a national products promotion network. The company will rely on the power of the national products promotion network to promote the cooperation between production and sales, to transform the commercial organization that is harmful to the development of our country's production, and to assist the government in implementing the policy of economic control. Then, your experience and facts in promoting national products will be a powerful reference in the future. From this, you can know the value of serving national products, and you must increase your spirit of struggle by knowing its value."</p>

<h3 id="e135">French Concession Police Department's Case Resolution Time <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Deliver to the Court Within 24 Hours</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association previously submitted a request to the President of the Court to correct the delay in the opening time of criminal cases in the Shanghai Second Special District Land Court and the occupation of lawyers' seats by police officers. The President ordered that the request be followed. Yesterday, the President again instructed the Association in writing: Instruction No. 1577 of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District District Court is an order to inform the matter. I have reviewed the Association's request to correct the opening time of criminal cases and have issued separate instructions to handle the matter and have given instructions in each case. Now, the French Concession Police Department's reply letter, translated as follows, is approved: Received your letter of December 22, regarding the delivery of cases to the court. The timing of the police department's delivery of cases is completely in accordance with the previously established schedule and has been communicated in a letter. The delivery schedule is now listed below:</p>
<p>Time of Capture Delivery to Judicial Advisor Delivery to Court</p>
<p>0:00 to 9:00 11:00 15:00</p>
<p>9:00 to 12:00 15:00 9:00 the next day</p>
<p>12:00 to 24:00 9:00 the next day 11:00 the next day</p>
<p>The events delivered to the court at 9:00 are those that occurred from 9:00 to noon the day before. These events are slightly less than those delivered to the court at 11:00, because the items delivered at 11:00 are those that occurred from noon to midnight the day before. According to the agreement, they must be delivered to the court within 24 hours, which has not been changed. Our department is now doing its best to send all cases to the Judicial Advisor's Office and then to the Court within 24 hours, etc. Approved accordingly, it is hereby ordered for your information. This order, Court President Ying Shi.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Alcohol Stamp Tax Is Not Convenient to Stop Collecting <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Approves the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to stop collecting the stamp tax on medicinal alcohol transported to the interior. The Ministry of Finance replied yesterday, stating: "Your telegram has been received. Foreign wine and alcohol are different in nature. After August 4th of last year, the customs import tax on foreign wine was increased to 80%. The taxes on foreign wine and similar products levied by various provinces have been included in the import tax, so they will no longer be collected. As for the import tax on alcohol, it has not been increased to 80%. The taxes levied by various provinces at 20 yuan per 100 jin have not been included in the customs import tax, so they are not exempt from collection. The current customs tariff is classified and listed very clearly. After comparison, it will be clear. What you mentioned in your telegram must be a misunderstanding. Alcohol is currently being planned for unified taxation. Before it is implemented, it should still be handled in accordance with the usual regulations. Your request to stop the collection should not be discussed."</p>

<h3 id="e139">Chang Yuting Case Declared Not Guilty <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Chang Yuting, the manager of the Daguan Garden Bathhouse on Xinzha Road, Xizang Road, reported to the Xinzha Patrol that he had received threatening and fraudulent leaflets and letters, suspecting his nephew-in-law Zhang Xingran and bathhouse employee Luo Guangqi of being accomplices. The patrol filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Court. Unexpectedly, during the second hearing, patrol clerk Mei testified that the handwriting in the threatening leaflets appeared to be Chang's own. As a result, Judge Wu declared Zhang and Luo not guilty in court, and the patrol immediately suspected Chang of false accusation. The next day, they filed a lawsuit against Chang in the same court for false accusation. Chang's agent lawyer, Zou Yaoxian, requested the court to appoint another expert for appraisal and, on the other hand, requested that Chang be released on bail and the hearing be postponed. Judge Xiao approved. Last week's court hearing involved proof from the scholar Qi Fanniu, who believed that the handwriting in the threatening leaflets was completely different from Chang's handwriting. After debate by the patrol lawyer Wang Yaotang and Chang's hired lawyers Ye Fukan and Zou Yaoxian, it was ordered to conclude the debate. Yesterday was the date for the verdict. Chang arrived in court with lawyer Zou Yaoxian. Judge Xiao announced the verdict: Chang Yuting was not guilty. It is heard that Chang still intends to seek legal remedies for the false accusations and the untruthful private morality aspects that insulted him. Under the persuasion of his lawyer Zou Yaoxian, he may take steps to settle the lawsuit.</p>

All walks of life can go for medical treatment if they are sick.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Judgment Main Text of Xie Fuci and Other Cases <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Part of the embezzlement of prisoner rations is revoked</p>
<p>Sentenced for falsely registering official documents</p>
<p>Xie Fuci, the former warden of the Second Special District Prison and the second sub-warden of the First Special District, and Fan Guozhen, the accountant, were previously reported by the prosecutor of the First Special District Court on suspicion of dereliction of duty and embezzlement of prisoner rations. The case was tried by the court, and the result was a not-guilty verdict. Subsequently, because the handling prosecutor refused to accept the verdict, he filed an appeal to the Higher Second Branch Court. The verdict was issued a few days ago, and the circumstances have been recorded in the previous report. However, the recorded details of the case are slightly different. It is now known that the Higher Court carefully investigated the part of Xie and Fan's dereliction of duty and embezzlement of prisoner rations, and no facts were found. It was ruled to reject the prosecutor's appeal and still declared them not guilty. Only because they mistakenly did not record newly received prisoners at 12:00 AM on the prisoners' Four Pillars Book as the next day during their tenure, they were considered to have registered untruthful official documents and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment each. The main text of the judgment stated: The original judgment regarding the embezzlement of prisoner rations is revoked. Xie Fuci and Fan Guozhen jointly exercised official documents with untruthful registration, each sentenced to one year of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined, with two days of detention equivalent to one day of imprisonment. The rest of the appeal is rejected. It is heard that Xie and Fan are still not convinced by this judgment. After receiving the judgment, they will file a statement with the Supreme Court for a third instance appeal.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Li Chao's Concubine Accused of Embezzling Property Case <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Postponed to the 19th for Retrial</p>
<p>Li Chao, from Changsha, also known as Li Xiguang, is 47 years old this year. He is a graduate of the Huangpu Military Academy and was formerly a section chief at the Nanjing General Headquarters. In March of the 20th year, when he went to Japan, he deposited all his movable property worth more than 100,000 yuan, bank deposit certificates, and real estate deeds in a safe deposit box at the Zhongnan Bank. In September of the same year, after Li returned to China, he suffered from neurological and hemiplegic diseases. He stayed in Nanjing and Suzhou for treatment, but to no avail. He then came to Shanghai and rented No. 4, Henry Lane, Henry Road, in the French Concession, for medical treatment. While ill, he handed over the safe deposit box key and seal to his concubine, Li Shijingxin, also known as Shi Xichun, for safekeeping. Later, because Li's illness gradually became serious, on the verge of danger, Li's first wife, Zhou Li, wanted to sort out the housework. She asked Shi for the key and invited her husband's uncle and brother to inspect the contents of the box at the Zhongnan Bank. All the property in the box was missing, and it was known that Shi had embezzled it. She asked Shi at home, but Shi left home without saying goodbye. Zhou then commissioned a lawyer to investigate the various banks and learned that there was a deposit of 100,000 yuan in the Citibank account under the name of Li Xi for a fixed term of one year. With Shi's embezzlement revealed, she reported to the Lao Zha Patrol on the evening of December 25 last year and sent detectives to arrest Shi at the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road, who was transferred to the French Patrol. The next day, she was transferred to the Second Special District Court for further investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Sun Penghai continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. First, the patrol lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the patrol's investigation process. Then, the plaintiff, Li Zhou Likai, recounted the discovery of the defendant's embezzlement, but the number of properties was slightly omitted. She also hired a lawyer to file an incidental civil lawsuit to recover the occupied property. When the defendant, Li Shijingxin, was interrogated, she denied embezzlement and knew nothing about the Citibank deposit. The safe deposit box key was handed over to me by my husband for safekeeping. She also hired a lawyer for defense. As a result of the interrogation, the court ordered that the investigation of the case was still needed, so it was ordered to postpone the retrial to the morning of the 19th. The defendant was ordered to pay a bail of 50,000 yuan and report to the guarantor at any time.</p>

<p>In the stone warehouse of Wu Aisheng's house at No. 5, Xin Sheng Lane, 128 Lane, La Fayette Road, Qianjiatang, in the French Concession, a fire suddenly broke out on the ground floor at more than 6:00 yesterday morning, and it was out of control. It broke through the roof and the fire brigade rushed to extinguish it, destroying one building. Three children living on the front building, the daughter of Yongren Chuan Ali (30 years old), a large steward, Da Ajju (4 years old), Xiao Ajju (1 year old), and his nephew Wang Acai (10 years old), failed to escape and were buried in the fire pit. Afterwards, the fire brigade pulled out the corpses. All three corpses were like coke, with broken arms and legs, and it was too horrible to bear. The patrol then sent detectives to transport the corpses to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for a post-mortem examination. Because the procedures were not completed on the same day, the court will be requested to examine them today. The patrol is still investigating the cause of the fire.</p>

After bringing tea, he immediately closed the door tightly. Nothing happened overnight. Until more than 12:00 the next morning, the waiter went to knock on the door to ask if the room was still connected, but there was no response for a long time. He was deeply shocked and tried to open the door. He caught sight of Fan hanging himself from the iron bed frame with a belt. He immediately notified the cashier and reported it to the patrol, ordering Chinese patrol number 3118 to come and transport the body to Renji Hospital, and then transport it to the morgue for examination. The deceased was only wearing a black cloth cotton padded jacket and pants, and a velvet head rope shirt.</p>

<p>Ma and Zhong's Two Daughters Were Claimed by Their Families</p>
<p>Liu Kaofeng, a Shandongese corporal of the Haig Road Police Station, No. 464, colluded with Lu Guo, a Jiangbei woman, on April 5 last year to abduct Ma Sibao, a flower-selling woman from Caohejing Township, and sell her to Yue Ai, a Cantonese woman who was a saltwater girl near Kunshan Garden, to work as a prostitute, specializing in foreign customers, earning 240 yuan, which was divided up. Later, Ai asked Ma to solicit customers on the road but failed and resold her to Wang Amei, the madam of the Yue brothel at No. 5, Zha Pu Road, for 260 yuan. Recently, because business was bleak, she was abused in every way, causing Sibao to escape on her own and report the situation to the Hongkou Patrol. Chinese detective Ding Baoxiang was sent to arrest Liu Kaofeng, Lu Guo, Wang Amei, and others, along with the suspected Jiangbei man Luo Asi, and they were sent to the First Special District Court for detailed interrogation. Luo Asi was ordered to post bail to go out, and the rest were returned to custody separately. Ma Sibao and Zhong Xiaoying, a 17-year-old Zhenjiang woman found in Liu's house (i.e., his lover), were sent to the Jiliang Institute for temporary stay, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Defendant Luo Asi did not arrive after posting bail. Patrol lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the facts of the case and said that the families of Ma and Zhong had all arrived in court. According to Ma Ziyu's statement, he is a carpenter in Ma's House, Caohejing. Sibao is his wife and they have been married for two years. She has always been well-behaved. She came to Shanghai to sell flowers that day and has not returned until now. He asked to punish the defendants and other crimes. Ma Sibao pointed out that Liu Kaofeng used a pistol to threaten her at the time, forcing her to Ai's place to work as a prostitute. According to Zhong Deli, Xiaoying is his adopted daughter. He and Liu are lovers, but he did not know about it. He also asked for strict punishment. The girl Xiaoying said that she lived with Liu and asked if it was voluntary. When questioned, the defendants' confessions were similar to the last time, asking for a ruling. Judge Wu ordered that Luo Asi, who had posted bail among the defendants, should still be returned to custody separately and ordered a re-examination. Ma and Zhong's two daughters were taken back by their families.</p>

<h3 id="e150">The County Government Issues a Notice to the Public Security to Pay Attention to Various Items <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Since taking office, Pan Zhongjia, the magistrate of Shanghai County, has thoroughly rectified the public security of the county. Now, he has also prompted the various public security sub-bureaus to pay more attention to various items and ordered them to be followed. The prompts are recorded as follows: (1) Since the Fujian Incident, the situation has been serious, and we should pay close attention to prevention; (2) During the winter defense period, we should abide by the winter defense meeting, add guard posts, and assign patrols and sentries to pay close attention to defense, and report them to the nuclear department at any time; (3) Our county is adjacent to the urban area, and all kinds of bandits and reactionaries are easy to mix in. We should pay attention to investigating them. We should also pay attention to them at any time in remote rural areas to prevent hiding traces; (4) The ban on all kinds of poisons, such as red pills and morphine, is strict. We should pay attention to strict investigation and prohibition, and must not have any shelter; (5) Officials and police officers should be energetic during service hours. However, form is connected to spirit. Although the neatness of clothing is a form, if the clothing is not neat, it is conceivable that the spirit cannot be uplifted. Clothing should be solemn to correct customs and uplift spirit; (6) Police officers on duty, whether patrolling or guarding, have responsibilities to bear. They must first understand where the responsibility lies before they can be effective. The responsibility should be guided at any time so that they can fulfill their duties; (7) Sheltering gambling and hiding fines are the most polluting points in police affairs. This bad habit must be eliminated as much as possible to avoid leaving a pretext for people and falling into the criminal network; (8) The merits and demerits of police officers must be clearly rewarded and punished; (9) Public security personnel should be responsible for more than one end in their duties. The above points are just a summary of the main points. The situation in each sub-bureau is slightly different. If there are any incidents that should be promoted or reformed, all those who have public security responsibilities are expected to submit their opinions at any time or submit them to the meeting for discussion, so as to eliminate malpractices and benefit practice.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Insurance Claim Association News <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Claim Association's Claim Committee has been claiming insurance premiums, the Social Bureau has acted as a mediator. The various situations have been recorded in previous reports. Recently, due to the end of the year, many policyholders are indeed without clothes or food, hungry and cold. Although the company has discussed relief, it has not been implemented. Therefore, on the morning of the 4th, more than 300 policyholders gathered at the association with a fierce momentum, insisting on going to petition or claim compensation. Standing Committee member Wang Zhixiang believed that since the Social Bureau was in charge of mediation, he should wait for good news. If he took rash action again, he was deeply afraid of causing trouble, so he persuaded the policyholders to stay. Wang and Tang Youye Jiaxing went to the Social Bureau to sincerely request a quick solution. Secretary Li agreed to handle it first and agreed to fully resolve it by the end of the lunar year. Wang and others returned to the meeting and reported the situation to the victims, who felt that the weather was severe and it was really difficult to wait for a long time. Secretary Li was kind enough to think of their plight, so they should implement relief in the shortest possible time. They immediately held an interim meeting and decided on three points: (1) A deadline of two weeks to resolve the issue, with a deadline of the 20th of this month, to implement relief. Otherwise, all policyholders will gather to demand compensation and petition, regardless of any sacrifice; (2) Send letters to Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Ye Jiaxing, and others, to quickly use their kindness and concern to mediate, so as to avoid policyholders from being forced to make decisions due to poverty; (3) Request the Association to convene a general meeting of the affected policyholders to be open to the public. Xu Zaikang, Ma Rugen, Liang Baolin, and others attended the meeting that day.</p>

<p>Lawyer Jin Zhizhi was previously sued by someone in a criminal complaint to the Shanghai District Court. The chief prosecutor of the Prosecutor's Office, Lou Ying, not only instructed the lawyer to pay a deposit of 500 yuan, but also, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Justice, transferred the order to the Shanghai Bar Association to withdraw Jin Zhizhi's membership from the case. Now, the case has been judged by the High Court and Jin Zhizhi is not guilty. The lawyer has filed a statement to recover the deposit. In accordance with the regulations, he has resumed his position as a lawyer. Yesterday, lawyer Jin Zhizhi sent a letter to the bar association, forwarding it to all levels of courts to restore his membership and perform his duties as a lawyer. However, the District Court has not received the documents from the High Court and cannot verify it. It has sent a reply to the Bar Association for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Courtroom Reading - Old Man Weeps Profusely <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>For Days, Nightmares and Apprehension Have Followed</p>
<p>The Deceased's Photo in Court Confirmed to be his Beloved Son</p>
<p>A Western-dressed young man was found bound and shot to death in an open field on the Cai family estate in Longhua. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that after examination by the prosecutor of the district court, seven or eight business cards of the Xu Gui Ji Construction Factory of North Sichuan Road, Keming Road, and two business cards of Xu Junhui were found in the pockets of the body. Therefore, it was determined that the deceased must be someone from Xu Gui Ji, and Xu Junhui might be the deceased's name. The police were immediately dispatched to summon the owner of the Xu Gui Ji Construction Factory to the court for questioning. However, the owner of Xu Gui Ji, Xu Guigui, was illiterate (49 years old, from Gaoqiao, Pudong). He arrived at the court with his wife, Xu Fan (11 years old), unaware of the matter. Because he had been involved in a rent dispute in court with Zhang Guitang of the Xiangmao Foreign Firm regarding his own house rental last December, he thought he was being summoned to pay a fee. He went to the bailiff's office to report. After reading the reason for the case, he was told that he was being summoned for questioning about a murder case. Mr. and Mrs. Xu were greatly suspicious and inquired repeatedly. At that time, someone was reading the newspaper and discussing it. The newspaper had a news item detailing that the male corpse found murdered on the Li family estate in Longhua had Xu Gui Ji and Xu Junhui's business cards on his person. Xu Fan immediately burst into tears upon hearing the name Xu Junhui, grief-stricken. Xu Guigui then told people, "Xu Junhui is my son. He is 21 years old this year. I only have this one son. He married Miss Chen at the age of 19 (19 years old this year)." He continued, "My son just graduated from Datia University and wanted to establish himself, so he went to Nanjing, introduced by a classmate, to work in the Ministry of Industry. He only returned a month ago and went out on the 2nd of this month. I never expected him not to return. The clothing style and situation described in the newspaper are undoubtedly my son's. That's why my old wife, I, and my daughter-in-law have been having nightmares and feeling apprehensive these past few days. It turns out to be such a tragedy." The old man was then shedding tears profusely. He then went to buy a newspaper himself and asked someone to read it again for him, becoming even more sorrowful as he listened. When asked if his son had any enemies or any suspicions, he shook his head and said, "Absolutely not." Since Xu already knew of his son's death, the couple took the summons and reported to the prosecutor's office. After a preliminary examination by the prosecutor, who confirmed that the photo was indeed their beloved son, they signed an affidavit to find the local bailiff to claim the body and requested that the murderer be apprehended and brought to justice.</p>

<p>To Hunt for Rare Beasts in Kangzang</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Mr. Yang Jiake, an overseas Chinese from Honolulu, previously accompanied the son of the late American President Roosevelt on an expedition to hunt in India and Tibet. He has now been commissioned by the American Museum of Natural History in New York and funded by private scientists. He arrived in Shanghai again last week and will depart with three zoological explorers on the 15th of this month for Qinghai and Xikang. They plan to spend more than a year searching for snow leopards and rare mammals. It is said that snow leopards are native to the Tibetan Plateau and live in snow-covered areas rarely visited by humans, making them extremely difficult to hunt. Once captured, they will be displayed in the Roosevelt Memorial Hall of the Natural History Museum. In addition, they plan to go to the Jishi Mountains to hunt small mammals, from free-tailed rats to foxes, all of which are on the list. This area is the source of the Yellow River and has not yet been surveyed or explored by modern people. However, it is difficult to predict whether they will be able to penetrate this area and must depend on the local situation. If they can capture live animals, they will also be transported back for breeding. He now hopes to obtain the cooperation of the New York Municipal Museum and the Academia Sinica to enhance the expedition. Their route is planned to be by river steamer to Chongqing, then overland to Yazhou and Daqianlu, to retrieve equipment and supplies left over from last year's exploration of Xikang, before heading to Qinghai. If they can pass through the Jishi Mountains, they will take the Longhai Railway through Lanzhou and Tongguan back to Shanghai. Last year, when he accompanied four American youths on an expedition to Xikang, they climbed the 24,000-foot Daxue Mountain. After escorting them back to Shanghai, he returned to the Tibetan Plateau to collect golden monkeys, blue sheep, grizzly bears, leopard-like civets, and pandas. He even donated a giant panda to the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society museum in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Rickshaw Boss Chen Dexing Assassinated <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Six Robbers Arrive in the Dead of Night</p>
<p>Feud Made to Look Like Robbery</p>
<p>Chen Dexing, a native of Taizhou, 33 years old, lived at No. 5 Haiyuan Lane, at the end of Qingyun Road, Zhabei. He made a living by renting out rickshaws, so his income was not bad. In addition, Chen was diligent and frugal, so he had accumulated some wealth over the years. At around midnight the night before last, Chen Zhengfang was about to go to bed when he suddenly heard urgent knocking on the door outside. Chen thought it was a rickshaw puller returning from his shift, so he put on his clothes and got up to open the door. Unexpectedly, the visitors were not rickshaw pullers, but six bandits wearing short blue and black cloth shirts and pants, speaking with a Jiangbei accent. Before Chen could speak, one of the bandits in the middle pointed and said, "This is Boss Chen." Another bandit immediately took out a gun and fired two shots at Chen, one hitting his left leg and the other his lower abdomen. He immediately fell to the ground, blood gushing out like a spring, and died instantly. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, scattered and fled to the west. However, one bandit turned back before fleeing, barged into Chen's bedroom, threatened Chen's wife, Cai, not to make a sound, and stole a small leather suitcase before fleeing. Cai, seeing the bandits leaving, also chased after them, hoping to call for help. But she saw her husband lying on the ground and knew something was wrong. She quickly took a lamp to check and found that he had already died. She was greatly alarmed and rushed to the police station No. 46 of the 5th precinct on nearby Xibaoxing Road to report the crime. The sub-station was notified and dispatched a senior police officer to investigate the scene. It was learned that there was nothing in the stolen leather suitcase except for several account books. It was clearly a feud killing, disguised as a robbery afterward to cover it up. The station reported the case to the 5th District Headquarters and ordered the local bailiff to report to the court for an inquest yesterday morning. Meanwhile, detectives were dispatched to search for the murderers in all directions.</p>

<p>Police Still Need to Investigate, Court Orders Reschedule for Further Inquiry</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Second Special Court Had Begun the Trial</p>
<p>Chen Acai, a Yongbo native who looks after the alley in Huashun Lane, Tongfu Road, in the Public Concession, invited several friends the day before yesterday afternoon: Zhou Hongxi, a detective No. 65 from the Old Patrol Station on Simalu; Chen Linrong, a chauffeur from the Wang Gongguan on Avenue Joffre; and others, to the Hongyun Gambling House in Lane 94, Huagenier Road, in the French Concession to gamble with Lin Jinyuan (also known as Lao Ba and Lin Juxian), a prostitute from Suzhou. At around 9 p.m., just after dinner, they were about to start another round of mahjong when Zhou Hongxi suddenly had an urgent need to urinate. He took off the Webley handgun issued by the patrol station and hid it under the pillow on the prostitute Lin's bed. As he turned to go behind the bed to use the bathroom, Chen Linrong caught sight of the handgun and took it out to play with it without permission, examining and caressing it. Because he did not close the safety, he touched the trigger, and a bullet suddenly flew out. The prostitute Lin, who was beside him, was hit and fell to the ground. While the crowd was in a panic, the patrol station on Songshan Road, having received a report, dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene. They arrested the murderer Chen Linrong and took him to the patrol station. Meanwhile, the injured person was sent to Renji Hospital. After doctors administered emergency treatment, the bullet had entered her abdomen, about an inch to the lower right of the navel, and pierced through her back, in the lumbar region. The injury was fatal, and she soon died. The head of the patrol station notified the patrol station and sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Morgue to await an inquest. The situation was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the patrol station escorted the murderer Chen Linrong to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for questioning. First, Yao Zhaodi, the patrol station's lawyer, explained the case, saying that due to time constraints, the patrol station had not yet investigated the case and that the victim had died of her injuries. He had reported it to the prosecutor of the court for an inquest and requested a postponement pending investigation. He also presented the handgun as evidence. Judge Xiong Huicui verified the statement, briefly questioned Chen Linrong, and then ordered a postponement until the 10th for further investigation. The defendant was remanded in custody. At noon, Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, along with the forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at the morgue to inspect the body. They confirmed the body and took their seats at the courtroom table. Bao Tan Qin Youyu reported the previous situation, followed by Qian Ziqing, a relative of the deceased, who filed a case requesting redress. The official questioned five witnesses, Chen Acai, Zhou Hongxi, Xia Zhou, Qiu, and Hu, about the incident. The defendant Chen Linrong had already been sent to the court, so he was not brought to the scene. Mr. Wang then ruled that Lin Jinyuan had died from gunshot wounds sustained during her lifetime. The body was claimed by the relatives of the deceased, and the defendant was to be handed over to the police department for court proceedings.</p>

<p>Police Have Been Notified to Pursue the Embezzled Funds</p>
<p>Zhang Jinyuan, a 32-year-old Chongming native, makes a living selling flowers. A few days ago, he collected 29 packages of white flowers in Chongming. On the 27th day of the tenth lunar month, he hired Shen Zaiqi, a boatman from his hometown, to transport them to Songjiang for sale. Although Shen was from Chongming, his family had moved to a village in the 11th district of Yinxiang Township in Songjiang South several years ago. Therefore, he was not only familiar with the people there but also had considerable influence. Seeing that the flower seller was weak and easy to bully, he harbored malicious intentions and falsely told Zhang that the price of flowers was the highest in Yinxiang, selling for eight jiao more per dan than elsewhere. Zhang, unaware of his trickery, agreed. On the first day of the eleventh lunar month, Shen sold the flowers to the Qiaji Flower Shop in Yinxiang for a total of 452 yuan. Shen Zaiqi took all the money. At that time, Zhang asked for it, but Shen only gave him 140 yuan. The remaining 312 yuan was taken by Shen, intending to forcibly embezzle it. When Zhang asked him for it, he kept delaying. More than half a month has passed, and not a single penny has been received. Trying to reason with him, he knew that he was unfamiliar with the area and outmatched. He had no choice but to leave in tears. He suddenly thought that these 312 yuan were his capital, and now that they had been embezzled, how could he face his family? Overcome with grief and indignation, he was seized by the thought of ending his life. When he arrived at the western section of Yuncao Creek in Wusong, he was about to jump into the river to commit suicide when Qiu Qingyuan, a Chongming native who had lived in Wusong for a long time, spotted him. Qiu immediately rushed forward and grabbed Zhang, asking him why he was trying to take his own life. Zhang lowered his head and remained silent. After repeated questioning, he explained the situation in detail. Upon hearing this, the onlookers felt indignation on his behalf. Someone accompanied him to report the incident to the First Branch of the 7th District Public Security Bureau, requesting that the police be ordered to arrest Shen Zaiqi and his accomplice, Zhu Maogou, for questioning.</p>

<p>Lu Denies Everything</p>
<p>Second Landlord Testifies to Cohabitation</p>
<p>Lu Zhixin, a local resident of Qipu Road, 27 years old, has some assets and enjoys indulging in pleasure-seeking activities. He often goes to brothels with friends, spending his days and nights in revelry. In the spring of this year, he met Yang Wenzhen, also known as Yingmei (the original name), the mistress of the Minhe Lane study. Yang, seeing that Lu was young, romantic, and generous, tried her best to please him, and the feelings between the two became increasingly intimate. They then took things a step further and began living together. Therefore, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, Yang Wenzhen closed down her study and rented a house with Lu at No. 44 Anle Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. They were deeply in love and devoted to each other. However, the beautiful scenery did not last long, and a storm suddenly arose. For some reason, a rift developed in their love, and their once intimate relationship came to an end. Recently, Yang hired a lawyer to send a letter to Lu, stating that he owed her 2,030 yuan for living expenses, had cheated her out of a diamond ring worth 1,500 yuan, and owed her a loan of 1,000 yuan, for a total of 4,530 yuan, plus 20,000 yuan in alimony, to be paid in full within three days to avoid legal action. After receiving the letter, Lu hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, preemptively accusing Yang Wenzhen of attempted fraud. The court summoned them twice, but since the plaintiff Lu Zhixin did not appear, the case was postponed. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the case was scheduled for further hearing. Both the plaintiff and defendant personally appeared in court. Lawyer Shen Xingxia, representing the plaintiff, stated that the portion of the accusation against Yang Wenzhen for attempted fraud should be withdrawn. The defendant's lawyer immediately objected, saying that the defendant had filed a countersuit for false accusation, embezzlement, disturbing public morals, fraud, and abandonment, so it could not be withdrawn. Judge Wu Xiangzu verified the report and said that according to precedent, the withdrawal of a private prosecution could be allowed. He then began to proceed with the countersuit portion. According to Yang Wenzhen's statement, after she became involved with Lu, Lu used sweet words and various deceptions. At that time, she was still running a room, and Lu falsely claimed that he was inviting guests the next day, but those he invited were all reputable merchants, so he borrowed a diamond ring from her. She agreed, but he never returned it. By the Mid-Autumn Festival, she had closed the study and rented a house with Lu at No. 44 Anle Lane. All expenses were borne by her. Lu went to the dog racing track every Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday and took the opportunity to borrow money from her. In addition to borrowing 1,000 yuan from her sister, Lu also pawned all her clothing and other items. Now that he saw that her money was exhausted, he abandoned her, treating her like worn-out shoes and no longer came around. Although she repeatedly negotiated, Lu enlisted friends Pan Mingzhi, Zhou Qifeng, and Zhu Houtian to negotiate with her, offering to return the diamond ring and repay 400 yuan, later increasing it to over 1,000 yuan. Because she had not seen Lu in person, she refused. She now requested the court to punish him according to the law and order him to return the cheated items and loans. When Lu Zhixin was questioned, he denied all of Yang Wenzhen's claims, saying that they had not had a relationship, had not lived together, and there had been no loans. Zheng Lupi, the second landlord of No. 44 Anle Lane, testified that she worked as an assistant at the Zhigong Law Firm and proved that Lu had come to rent the house on September 24 of last year, stating that the monthly rent was 60 yuan. Later, Lu and Yang Wenzhen moved in together. Judge Wu said that the case still needed to be investigated further and ordered a postponement until the 12th for further hearing. The defendant was ordered to provide a guarantor who could be summoned at any time, or be taken into custody if no guarantor was available.</p>

<p>Old Postman Worse Than a Beast</p>
<p>Young Woman Sacrifices Her Life</p>
<p>Jin Zilin, a Shaoxing native, 55 years old, living at No. 23 Ronghua Lane, Malang Road, French Concession, works as postman No. 87 at the post office. He has worked at the post office for nearly 20 years. His wife, Zhu, is about the same age. Because they have no children, Jin also has an affair with a Ningbo woman, Zhu (43 years old this year), and lives separately as a concubine. They have a daughter who is six years old this year. Jin's wife, Zhu, regrets that she has no biological children, so she discussed with her husband, Jin Zilin, at the beginning of last summer, to ask Liu Qian, the wife of tailor Liu Lingeng, a native of Changzhou and their neighbor, to find a girl to be their adopted daughter. Through Qian, she introduced Mei Ying, the second daughter (17 years old this year) of Duan Wang, a rural woman (41 years old this year) from Changzhou Tianshali Township, to Jin and his wife as their adopted daughter. On June 14th of the old lunar calendar last year, Liu Qian and the girl's maternal uncle, Wu Peigen, escorted the girl to their door. Jin Zilin renamed the girl Lai Bao. On July 7th, Jin's wife, Zhu, died of illness. Mei Ying wore mourning clothes and attended the funeral. Later, Jin brought back his concubine Zhu and her daughter, making Zhu the legal wife. From then on, the couple and two daughters slept in the same room, in two separate beds. Unexpectedly, Jin, at the age of 50, had not diminished in lust. Seeing that Mei Ying was somewhat attractive and a budding flower, he thought he could deceive her because she was young and arouse the old man's desire to have a son. On the evening of January 18th of the old lunar calendar this year, his bestial nature broke out. Taking advantage of Mei Ying's sleep, he climbed onto her bed and attempted to rape her</p>

<p>The Circulation Library attached to this newspaper is one of the ways our library serves the community. Its purpose is to supplement the inadequacies of news education and provide the general public with opportunities to gain knowledge. Since its establishment a year ago, according to recent statistics, an average of 600 readers borrow books every day, and the total number of registered readers is nearly 5,000. This shows that the establishment of the Circulation Library does indeed meet the urgent needs of the general public. However, according to another statistic, most of the library's readers are diligent and self-taught young people who, despite having access to books, still lack the guidance of teachers and friends and have no way to resolve their academic difficulties. Therefore, this library has specially created a [Reading Guidance] section to assist readers, and this newspaper has also specially added a [Reading Q&amp;A] column to provide readers with a forum for questioning and solving doubts. This is an unprecedented initiative, and we sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will provide guidance and assistance to help us achieve our goal. The [Reading Q&amp;A] regulations are attached below.</p>

<p>This column is based on the purpose of establishing [Reading Guidance] to allow readers to ask questions at any time. The scope of questions and answers is specifically defined as follows: 1. Questions about personal reading plans and reading methods; 2. Questions about each book, whether it is unclear words or phrases, or incomprehensible theories; 3. Research on the central idea of each book, or discussion of one's own critical opinions; 4. Collection of reference books. Within the above scope, this column will do its best to answer. If difficult questions are encountered, various specialized scholars will be specially invited to solve them. However, readers who submit letters to ask questions or still have doubts about the answers must strictly follow the following procedures: 1. All letters must indicate the number and name of the sender's library borrowing card and address. Readers from other cities can only write their name, gender, occupation, and education level; 2. For questions about the second item above, the letter must indicate the book, volume, page, author's name, and publishing bookstore; 3. The handwriting must be clear, preferably transcribed on manuscript paper printed by various bookstores. Do not write in pencil; 4. The wording of the questions should be concise, and the meaning of the discussion should also be concise, avoiding rambling and lengthiness; 5. If the answer in this column is still unclear or unsatisfactory, the second letter must first record the main points of the first answer and one's own questions and request guidance; 6. If the questions and answers cannot be clarified, readers can request a face-to-face meeting with [Reading Guidance] at the Shen Bao Circulation Library. If [Reading Guidance] deems it necessary, it can also send a letter to request a conversation; 7. All Shen Bao Reading Newspaper Offices are valid only if they have a [Reading Q&amp;A] stamp, otherwise, no answers will be given; 8. Letters must be clearly marked with "Shen Bao Circulation Library [Reading Guidance] Receive" on the envelope and have sufficient postage stamps.

<p>Dear Sir, After reading the report in your newspaper on the 1st of this month about Xie Fuzi and Fan Guozhen embezzling prisoners' rations and being sentenced to one year of imprisonment after the prosecutor's appeal, it is completely inconsistent with the original judgment. After investigation, the first instance of this case was declared not guilty, and the second instance also clarified that there was no embezzlement of prisoners' rations. The conviction was based on the point of using false information in official documents. A look at the judgment's main text shows that the part about the embezzlement of prisoners' rations was revoked. Xie Fuzi and Fan Guozhen jointly used false information in official documents and were each sentenced to 8</p>
<p>one year of imprisonment, and the rest of the appeal was dismissed. This can be clearly understood. As for the so-called use of false information in official documents, it refers to the fact that in the reported forms, the prisoners to be escorted on the next day were sometimes listed on the previous day. However, this was caused by a mistake in the registration by the female prison supervisors, and it has absolutely no impact on the actual payment and sales of prisoners' rations. Although supervisory officials at all levels are inevitably responsible for negligence, it does not constitute a criminal offense. In addition to applying for an appeal for relief in accordance with the law, we hereby send a special letter to your newspaper for correction in order to show the facts and protect our reputation. We are extremely grateful. Sincerely, Xie Fuzi and Fan Guozhen.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Vocational Education Report <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>▲The Influence of Machine Industry: The development of machine industry means that a large number of workers are gathered in one place. The transmission of technology, if still in the form of apprenticeship, is difficult, and the products of the factory are timed. Teaching students must take a lot of time. To teach students, it takes a lot of time and losses will be significant if simultaneously held in the factory. Therefore, the training of students' technology must be separated from the factory, and there is a need to open classes and establish education. This is the beginning of organized vocational education, which is initiated by employers.</p>
<p>▲The Self-Consciousness of the Social Masses: Since the Industrial Revolution, the lives of workers in Europe have become more prosperous, and national education has gradually become popular. As a result, ordinary workers and low-level employees often feel that their own knowledge is insufficient as their knowledge increases day by day, and they need to improve their knowledge. In London, England, at the beginning of the 19th century, there were organizations such as Mechanics Institutes and Workingmens Colleges, all of which were automatically initiated by workers' groups. Later, there were workers' night schools and youth night schools. In the book "Industrial Education" by 8</p>
<p>Millis), there is the following paragraph about the development of 8</p>
<p>industrial education:</p>
<p>"At that time, there were two forces pushing forward. One was the workers' feelings about political and social instability, and the other was their desire to improve themselves and raise the status of their profession. Therefore, they were very concerned about the training of workers' skills and the training of young workers. They were especially eager for the scientific principles applied to their occupations. The vocational education movement was actually produced by these forces.] This is the original motivation for vocational education from the workers themselves.</p>
<p>▲The Competition in the World Economic Market: European countries, concerned about the benefits of vocational education, all believe that vocational education has a great relationship with the entire economic organization of the country. Because European countries, such as England, Germany, and Belgium, are all countries with excessive industrial production. The lifeblood of their domestic economy lies entirely in conquering the world market with their products. The key to whether they can sell their products to the world market lies entirely in the exquisiteness and applicability of their products, the reduction of costs, and the savings in transportation costs. All of these cannot be achieved without starting with good, complete, and organized vocational education. The Italian authorities said, ["The development of a country's industry requires several necessary conditions, such as raw materials, credit, merchant ships, the expansion of new markets, and indispensable skilled workers. If they are trained by schools using scientific and rational methods, the guarantee will be even more solid."] Millis also said, ["If a country's industry wants to occupy a position in the international market, it must rely on vocational education as a backing."] In 1883, England established the National Association For The*</p>
<p>Promotion of Technical Education). The main points of its declaration include the following (Note 2): (a) Any educational reforms that can enhance the skills of service personnel in the industrial sector should be encouraged. (b) The training of young people's hands and eyes should be stepped up. (c) The principles of science and arithmetic, which are the basis of national industry, should be made more popular.</p>
<p>["Industrial education is one of the essential elements of a country's economic lifeline. Our country (referring to Belgium) relies on the sale of industrial products to establish its status. If we do not strive to reduce the cost of our products, the danger is truly unimaginable. According to the teachings of experience, if we want to reduce costs, we must rely on excellent technology. If modern craftsmanship wants to win in the international arena, it must have technicians who have been trained in schools and are familiar with the latest methods to be driven by them to achieve results."] From this, it can be seen that European countries regard vocational education as the basis for their national life, and they all promote it without sparing any effort.</p>
<p>The current social and economic situation in our country, its exhaustion and poverty, has reached its extreme point. The reason for this can be summed up in one sentence, that is, the result of the dumping of industrial manufactured products from various countries. The annual leakage is huge, reaching tens of millions of dollars, which is the so-called economic aggression. The remedy is nothing more than two ways: 1. Resist foreign goods; 2. Establish manufacturing industries. The former is passive, unsustainable, and unnatural; the latter is a constructive national, positive, and hopeful path. Therefore, vocational education is an urgent task at present. However, the development of vocational education must have a suitable environment, just as fish must have water and plants must have rain and dew. Our primary, secondary, and higher education have not yet been put on the right track. It is difficult to demand perfection from vocational education alone. This is one reason. Vocational education is based on primary school education. When elementary education has not yet been completely organized, it is contrary to reason to seek satisfactory results from vocational education. This is the second reason. The authorities, although they know that vocational education is the only tool to resist economic aggression, whether they can appreciate its importance and implement it resolutely is the third reason. If the local government and the education authorities are slightly separated, the implementation will be weak and the results will be limited. This is the fourth reason. With these four reasons, it is difficult to develop vocational education in our country as much as possible in a short period of time. Other matters, such as the method of promotion and the raising of funds, are secondary matters. The following briefly lists the scope of vocational education and its relationship with social economy and local needs in order to clarify the general meaning of vocational education. The current situation of vocational education in various European countries will be described in detail in the next chapter.</p>
<h3 id="e178">I. The Scope of Vocational Education <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Vocational education is closely related to adult continuing education and specialized education, and it is often difficult to distinguish them. Among the schools in our country that are close to vocational nature, in addition to the three types of commerce, agriculture, and engineering, there are also schools of telecommunications, medicine, pharmacy, merchant shipping, and fine arts. Foreign schools that use the name "vocational" are also numerous and difficult to name. Therefore, the scope of vocational education is particularly difficult to determine. Roughly speaking, there are the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Agricultural schools, such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fruits and vegetables, sericulture, brewing, horticulture, and rural economics;</p>
<p>(2) Commercial schools, in addition to general commercial courses, there are also vocational courses for service in embassies and consulates abroad;</p>
<p>(3) Engineering schools, such as mechanical, electrical, architectural, textile, mining, and chemical engineering;</p>
<p>(4) Trade Schools</p>
<p>Catering, sewing, hat making, home economics, hairdressing, cooking, interior decoration, ceramic embroidery, machine installation, ironwork, locksmithing, woodworking, jewelry making, goldsmithing, engraving, printing, shoemaking, watchmaking, machine tool manufacturing, etc.</p>
<p>(5) Maritime schools, such as driving and engines;</p>
<p>Commercial schools and engineering schools are also collectively referred to as Trade Schools, and SchoolsofArtsondCrafts is sometimes used to include a part of engineering schools and trade schools. Therefore, in terms of names, it is not easy to analyze the categories of vocational schools and not confuse them. The above five categories are only general.</p>
<h3 id="e179">II. Vocational Education and Social Economy and People's Lives <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The report of the League of Nations Education Inspection Team contributed a lot to the reform of education in our country. The two points that it repeatedly and earnestly said are: (1) The curriculum of our schools is too far from the actual lives of the people; (2) The secondary school curriculum should not be exclusively for students preparing to enter universities. In the section on vocational education, it also said,</p>
<p>["Chinese education should be more practical, and should especially focus on vocational education and specialized education. This report has been repeatedly voiced before and after."]</p>
<p>Politicians in various European countries have high vision and foresight, knowing that the enrichment of national economic strength is not only about the people having enough food and clothing, but also about expanding the world market to sell their surplus production. The wider the market, the more sales, the more the people will gain, and the more powerful the financial resources will be. Their success is all based on vocational education. In our country, if we can also plan to expand the world market and absorb foreign resources to adjust the domestic financial difficulties, it is certainly urgent. However, except for raw materials, it is by no means possible within a few decades for our country, which lags behind in machine manufacturing industry, to compete with various countries with manufactured products. According to the current situation in our country, the first step in vocational education, in addition to the necessary machine industry, should be to maintain our country's inherent handicrafts. The poverty of the country is often proportional to the number of idlers and unemployed in the country. The more idlers increase and the fewer producers decrease, the more parasites there will be, and the national strength will inevitably be exhausted. This is an inevitable principle. Giant cities and large ports in the country are dens of bandits and thieves, and beggars gather. They neither produce nor cause trouble. The loss to the country is difficult to calculate. In rural villages and small towns, due to the collapse of the rural economy, the old handicrafts are declining day by day, and the number of unemployed is increasing day by day. This is the greatest hidden danger of the country. If this is not cured for a long time, the national economic bankruptcy can be seen immediately. The current urgent need, in addition to maintaining public order with political power on the one hand, so that the people can live and work in peace, is to use educational methods to increase production and improve technology, so that rural undertakings can gradually recover and handicrafts will not be completely eliminated. Social economy and people's lives are closely related to vocational education. The Belgians have a saying, ["The British are rich in automatic spirit, and the French are rich in aesthetic ideas, but in the end, they are not as good as the Germans' good technical education and the power of great people. Therefore, Germany has today's superior economic position in the world."] In the fierce whirlpool of modern economic warfare and economic aggression, if our country does not work hard on industrial and vocational education in order to gain a foothold, all new and old production undertakings in the country will be squeezed and ravaged day by day, and it will be seen that they will decline and perish. The danger is unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e180">III. Vocational Education Must Meet the Needs of the Locality <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>There are currently no fewer than 300 national, provincial, and private vocational schools in our country. According to the types, there are industry, agriculture, commerce, medicine, music, fine arts, law and politics, fisheries, salt affairs, customs, postal affairs, telecommunications, merchant shipping, and police affairs. However, schools for customs, salt affairs, postal affairs, telecommunications, and police affairs are not only abnormally specialized in nature, but also have a very weak relationship with direct production. Therefore, vocational schools that have a direct relationship with the national economy should be schools of industry, agriculture, and commerce. Professor Svadkovsky of Soviet Russia told us in his book [Soviet Education] that 80% of the schools in the Soviet Union are engineering vocational schools, and 95% of the students in the country are in engineering vocational schools. According to French statistics, 80% of the people in the country serve in the agricultural, commercial, and industrial sectors. Therefore, it can be imagined that the most urgent need for vocational schools is agricultural, industrial, and commercial courses. The situation in other countries in the world is similar. When vocational schools for agriculture, commerce, and industry in our country are established, the automatic power of the provinces and local governments is greater. Therefore, the location of the schools can be distributed in the provinces, but the environment of the schools in the provinces is very different from the local industry and commerce and the supply of raw materials, but the departments established by the schools are all roughly the same, and the location of agricultural schools is not the center of rural undertakings. Therefore, most of the students are not 8</p>
<p>children of farmers, and after graduation, they do not serve in rural areas or engage in farming and animal husbandry. Therefore, the original reason is that agricultural schools lose their purpose of establishment and lose their effectiveness. They neither contribute to the agricultural undertakings on the technical front nor introduce talents. It seems equal to a fictitious establishment. Engineering schools and craft schools mostly favor new European and American crafts, and there are few who promote our country's old crafts. That is, they focus more on machine industry and ignore handicrafts. For example, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and civil engineering are established by almost all schools, and there are several schools that also establish applied chemical engineering courses. In our country, where the basic chemical industry has no foundation, it is appropriate that the employment and service problems of students after graduation are always the most difficult problems for schools. On the contrary, the businesses that are needed for people's daily life or the inherent special industries in various provinces and regions, such as furniture and utensils manufacturing, brick and tile lime manufacturing, bamboo and rattan ware industry, hardware tool industry, as well as the porcelain industry, pottery industry, lacquerware industry, leather industry, embroidery industry, ivory carving industry, etc., all have a foundation and a great social demand, but they lack specialized schools to provide research and no specialized courses to train technical talents. Therefore, the arts of various industries are sealed in the old steps and there is no progress at all. Moreover, there is a trend of decline. The University of Copenhagen in Denmark, which specializes in the porcelain engineering department due to the Royal Porcelain Factory, is ashamed. In summary, the existing vocational schools in our country, with a few exceptions, have one or more of the following shortcomings: 1. The departments established do not meet the needs of the special circumstances of the locality; 2. The location of the establishment is not entirely suitable; 3. The equipment is not complete; 4. The teaching materials are not practical; 5. The old handicrafts in our country are ignored. Or it is said that the old-fashioned crafts in our country have always been taught by masters and apprentices, and there is no need to set up schools to teach them. This is not entirely true. The old-fashioned crafts in our country often regress and make little progress because they stick to the old ways. In various European countries, all craft disciplines are based on art, so the style, color matching, etc. of the finished products all have artistic ideas and are suitable for the psychology of ordinary people, so sales are smooth and the business is growing. This is one of the most important points in craft technology. A French vocational educator said,</p>
<p>["Craftsmanship should meet the needs of the times and the economy and cultivate its talents. Therefore, it is flexible and requires students to pay attention to the economic conditions of all parties in the sales of products, so it is also progressive."] The [European Craft Schools] published by the British Ministry of Education also stated that ["Craft schools must pay attention to the changes and needs of the industrial sector." ] The biggest reason why vocational education in our country has not been able to show excellent results in the past is that it has not paid attention to the changing circumstances and needs of the industrial sector and the economic conditions of all parties. In other words, it is not suitable for local needs. Therefore, the employment of graduates is often a big problem, or they are idle and useless, or they change to other industries. The credibility and status of vocational schools in society are greatly damaged. Therefore, it is the first essential that vocational schools must meet the needs of the locality. (Note 1) The vocational schools run by the Shanghai Chinese Vocational Education Society and the provincial vocational schools in various provinces also have achievements, but the number is small. (Note 2) See the book "TradeSchoolsontheContinnet" published by the British Ministry of Education.</p>

<p>▲Compensation Considered for Losses of Affected Students</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Peiping) Following the fire in the Third Study Room of the College of Science at Normal University, Principal Li Zheng telegraphed the Ministry of Education to request punishment. Today (the 4th), the university posted a notice instructing affected students to list their lost items and submit them to the Dormitory Affairs Office for verification. Simultaneously, the affected students also held a meeting to discuss solutions. Principal Li Zheng scheduled a university affairs meeting at 3:00 PM on the 5th at the Office of the College of Liberal Arts. Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, Li Jinxi; Dean of the College of Science, Liu Tuo; Dean of the College of Education, Li Jianxun; Principal Li Zheng; and Secretary Yi Jia, among others, attended to discuss solutions to the fire's aftermath, including compensation for student losses and future fire prevention plans. It is said that these matters will be discussed together. It was discovered that the fire at the College of Science of Normal University occurred at 1:00 PM on the 2nd. At 1:20 PM, Principal Li Zheng, Secretary Yi Jia, and Wang Ruchuan heard the news and rushed to investigate. At the time, the fire was raging. Because the fire scene was very close to the library, Li and others, on one hand, assisted in extinguishing the fire and, on the other hand, protected the library and the various laboratories of the College of Science. With the assistance of the fire brigade, a major disaster was averted. Twenty-four rooms of the Third Study Room and three grey sheds of the Physics Laboratory were burned. These buildings were insured with the British Taikoo Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company in Tianjin for a total of 4,000 yuan, with 3,000 yuan for the Third Study Room and 1,000 yuan for the Physics Laboratory. It is estimated that the value of books, notes, and laboratory equipment inside the study room is around 50,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Jinan University Petitioning Representatives Return to School <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Student Representatives Yesterday Visited Three School Directors, Wu, Kong, and Song</p>
<p>(News from the Zheng Expulsion Committee of the Jinan University Protection School) Since the Zheng expulsion movement at National Jinan University, it has been nine days. The student side has a firm attitude. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Staff Return to School for Office Work When representatives of the Zheng expulsion committee met Mayor Wu, Mayor Wu ordered the committee to restore order to the school. Therefore, the Zheng expulsion committee sent a letter asking staff members of all departments to return to school for office work and announced that those who did not return would be considered resigned. Staff members of all departments returned to school for office work on the 4th.</p>
<p>▲Library Renamed The library of the school was originally named "Hongnian Library." The Zheng expulsion committee, because Zheng deceived the world and stole his name, has now renamed the library "Jinan Library" and opened it as usual. Students are studying in the library. ▲Petitioning Representatives Return to School The petitioning representatives to Beijing have now returned to school. It is said that the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission all expressed sympathy for the peaceful movement at Jinan University, but hope to restore normalcy and maintain order as soon as possible. As for the removal of the president, they are waiting for a central government resolution. (China and Foreign News Agency) The current turmoil at National Jinan University, according to general speculation, is not a matter of a day or two. It is now learned that the central authorities, considering the current tense situation and restless public sentiment, should not further expand the matter and have issued an order to stop it. The Nanjing Alumni Association of Jinan University and various parties in Shanghai related to Jinan University have all come forward to mediate.</p>
<p>▲End-of-Term Examinations for This Semester Previously announced by President Zheng to be held on the 8th, the registration staff have returned to school for office work to handle examination matters and have notified all faculty, staff, and students to go to the examinations on schedule.</p>
<p>▲Faculty and Staff Move Out The Student School Protection Committee notified all school staff on the 3rd (those deemed unsatisfactory were not notified) and school workers to return to work as usual starting on the 4th, otherwise, they would be considered resigned. All faculty and staff believe that their service to the school is based on a contract with the president, and whether to resign or not should be decided by the president, not by a small number of students issuing orders. They all expressed that they would ignore the order. As for professors who normally respect the Way and teach and do not care about other things, such as Chen Zhongfan, Zhang Yaoxiang, Zhang Fengzeng, Ke Duan, and Zhang Liyuan, they have also been severely oppressed and have mostly moved out of Jinan New Village and the vicinity of Zhenru. As for the Hongnian Library, it was built with donations solicited by former President Jiang Qi. At the time, Zheng Hongnian donated the most, so it was named Hongnian Library to commemorate him. It has now been renamed Jinan Library by the Student School Protection Committee, not knowing that the name was chosen by the former president.</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) After the turmoil at National Jinan University, the student side sent representatives to Beijing to petition, who returned to school yesterday. The School Protection Committee then sent representatives to visit the three school directors, Wu, Kong, and Song, requesting Zheng's removal. The school's situation remains as usual, and the faculty and staff have also returned to school for office work. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Mayor Wu and Others Expressed The Zheng expulsion committee sent three representatives, Zhou Zhaoqin, Fan Xifan, and Huang Deguan, to visit school director Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM. The mayor personally received them and instructed the representatives to tell all the students to strictly maintain order. He said that he would notify all the school directors within days to report the matter to the Central Government to resolve the president's issue as soon as possible. They then visited School Director Kong Xiangxi, and Kong's secretary, Fan Heyan, received them on his behalf, promising to convey their intentions to Kong. They then visited School Director Song Ziwen, and Song, due to his busy schedule, promised to receive them at 10:00 AM tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲University Federation Cables the Ministry of Education The Shanghai University Student Federation cabled the Ministry of Education yesterday, saying: Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, since Zheng Hongnian became the president of National Jinan University, several years have passed, and there have been no achievements. Recently, his actions have been perverse, inciting turmoil, causing public dissatisfaction, and arousing public criticism. Now, the students of the school are not abandoning themselves due to the lack of responsibility on the part of the school authorities, but are still studying peacefully and maintaining order. Recently, there have been moves to request that faculty and staff resume classes as soon as possible. This shows that this incident was caused by Zheng Hongnian alone, and opposing Zheng's presidency is not only a unanimous demand of all students of the school, but also sympathized with by the general public. Zheng's departure will bring peace. We hope that you will comply with the situation and quickly remove Zheng and select a virtuous and capable person. It would be very fortunate for the future of Jinan University and for the future of education. Shanghai University Student Federation respectfully bows.</p>

The speech was both serious and humorous, moving all listeners. Pudong Middle School teacher Ma Chong and alumnus representative Huang Jinwu successively delivered congratulatory speeches. The meeting ended at 11:30 AM with a group photo.

<p>▲The American Women Have Strong Strength and Exquisite Performance</p>
<p>▲Liangjiang's Championship This Year is Greatly Threatened</p>
<p>The Xiqing Women's Basketball League has been underway for more than six weeks, with only five weeks remaining. Judging from the current situation, the overall picture can be seen. The American Women and Liangjiang are tied for first place with five wins in five games. Although Southeast A has only lost once to the Red Team, its hopes are not very high. The current frontrunners are still the American Women and Liangjiang. As for the American Women's team, under the guidance of Mr. Brando this year, their performance is as exquisite as that of Liangjiang. Their tactics are completely like those of men, and they are taller than Liangjiang, and their guards are also stronger. Whether Liangjiang can maintain the championship this year is a big question. It is worth noting whether they can subdue the American Women in the future final. As for Southeast A, judging by its performance, it is unlikely to win against Liangjiang. The recent situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Team Name Wins Losses Points For Points Against Percentage</p>
<p>American Women 5 times 0 times 188 56 1.000</p>

<p>▲Jinan Wins Over Xiaguang At the beginning of the game, the two teams held each other for a long time. After Chen Zhaoqiu of Xiaguang scored a point with a free throw, Xiaguang's momentum suddenly surged. Lin and Huang, the two forwards, charged left and right, unstoppable. In an instant, Xiaguang led 8-0. Jinan tried hard to fight back, and after Xu Heng scored, Huang Zhaolin re-entered the field, and the momentum was boosted. However, Xiaguang still had the advantage, and the score once reached 15-8. Later, Jinan finally tied the score at 21-21 with the efforts of Huang Zhaolin. In the second half, Jinan's momentum shifted smoothly. Huang, Han, and Xu continued to score, and the score soared. The two defenders of Xiaguang were ejected from the field after committing four fouls one after another, and the situation declined. As a result, Jinan won 50-35.</p>

However, after the team's efforts, Xiqing, though brave, could not do as it pleased. After holding for five minutes, Lan Kenfu, the center forward of Xiqing, had a flash of inspiration. After a free throw, he scored two consecutive goals. Moore failed to score because his shots were inaccurate, losing many opportunities. In the first half, Xiqing led 15-6. In the second half, Xiqing continued to dominate and Moore could not keep up. As a result, Xiqing won 32-13.</p>

<p>The Schering Cup was initiated because the pharmacy football teams, which have been organized for a long time, lacked leadership and there were concerns about accidents. Therefore, they successively requested Mr. Tu Kaitai, the Chinese General Manager of the German Schering Company, to promote it. After repeated preparations and organization, it was very complete, and the Chinese Referee Association was invited to serve as the referee for the competition. Therefore, the managers or persons in charge of the pharmacies were also happy to agree. Since it began on November 26th of last year, according to the drawn dates, twelve out of twenty-one games have already been played. Fortunately, the teams are all from the same industry, have good relationships, and support the committee and obey the referees, so the competition has been quite harmonious and smooth. The results of the teams that have already competed are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e206">Radio Psychometry Device <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Recently, British scientist Major Philip created a very interesting radio instrument called the Radio Psychometry Device. This is the first application of radio to psychology, and its reputation has spread to various countries. I will describe it to enlighten readers.</p>
<p>This device is extremely sensitive. Anyone who approaches it will cause an effect. The effect is even more pronounced when a hand approaches a pre-set copper plate. Previous explanations for this phenomenon attributed it to the human body's capacitance, which alters the inter-electrode capacitance between the grid and filament in the vacuum tube, thus changing the output plate current. However, Major Philip refutes this explanation, stating that recent radio scientists have used sophisticated instruments to prove that an electric field exists around the human body. He suggests that many phenomena in radio communication, previously attributed to human body capacitance, may actually be due to the effects of this electric field.</p>
<p>We all know that the human body's resistance changes with a person's actions and emotions. Precise instruments can record this change when a person experiences a sudden shock. Therefore, the so-called capacitance effect may be another phenomenon altogether, which seems reasonable.</p>
<p>The diagram shows the circuit of this device as tested by American radio scientists. It closely resembles a typical audio frequency amplification circuit, using a screen grid tube as the input tube, fed through a high-impedance primary audio frequency transformer to a triode output tube. The input tube's grid circuit is open, with only a copper plate connected to the grid. When a hand is placed near this plate, the output tube's plate current changes. The ammeter indicating this plate current can be a sensitive milliampere meter connected in parallel with the output transformer's primary winding. To ensure clear recordings, it is best to connect a 4.5V C battery and a 0.5 Meg variable resistor across the ammeter to block the original plate current from passing through the meter. Further adjust the variable resistor to set the original plate current reading to zero when the device is in use. The potentiometer R is used to adjust the stability and sensitivity of the measuring device.</p>
<p>When using this device, an additional device must be added to ensure that the distance between each test subject's hand and the copper plate is exactly the same, so the results obtained can be accurate. The results of the experiment have not yet been published, but it is believed that because different people can measure different results, based on these different results, humans can be divided into several categories according to their nervous temperament or mental activity. This issue is now open to the public, and experiments are welcome, and the conclusion of the experiment is even more anticipated.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Direct-Reading Vacuum Tube Voltmeter <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Ordinary AC voltmeters can only be used to measure AC voltages with extremely low frequencies. If you use it to measure audio frequency or radio frequency voltages, it will not be applicable.</p>
<p>There is a type called a thermoammeter, which is constructed using the principle of thermal expansion and contraction. When current passes through a conductor, it heats up, and the conductor expands when heated, which can push the pointer of the ammeter. This kind of ammeter is very accurate in measuring currents of any frequency. However, in electricity, heat is proportional to the square of the current (L²R). If the current is too small, it cannot push the pointer, so this kind of meter is ineffective in measuring voltage.</p>
<p>Since the invention of the triode vacuum tube, people have used it to make high-frequency voltmeters. This kind of meter consumes very little external power when used, so the obtained value is exceptionally accurate.</p>
<p>Looking at Figure 1A, you can see the relationship between the triode vacuum tube's grid voltage and plate current. When the grid voltage is negative five volts, the plate current is reduced to zero. At this time, if the grid is connected to an external positive voltage, the plate current will increase. If it is connected to a negative voltage, the plate current will remain at zero. Observe the diagrams abcd··· and ABCD etc. to understand clearly. If the high-frequency voltage is connected to the plate, the obtained plate current will be shaped like 1, 2, etc. This kind of unidirectional current will of course cause the milliampere meter in the plate circuit to move. (See Figure 1B)</p>
<p>Figure 1A</p>
<p>Figure 1B is the wiring diagram of the vacuum tube voltmeter. When the external high-frequency voltage is connected to points XX, the ammeter connected in series in the plate circuit will have a reading. The magnitude of the plate current can be used to infer the magnitude of the external voltage.</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned vacuum tube voltmeter is extremely simple in construction, various AC voltages of known values must be measured in turn beforehand, and then a curve diagram of the external voltage and plate current must be drawn before the value can be calculated according to the diagram. In addition, the values of C voltage and B voltage must be absolutely the same, otherwise the obtained record will not be accurate.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the above-mentioned difficulties, there is another type called a Slideback Vacuum Tube Voltmeter. The C voltage can be adjusted arbitrarily. As a result, the value of the external voltage can be directly calculated in the grid voltmeter V.</p>
<p>In Figure 2B, R1 is a potentiometer of considerable value. Before use, adjust R1 to make the plate current value zero. (At this time, the value of the grid C voltage is assumed to be E1.) When the external AC voltage E is connected at XX, the plate current will inevitably increase (such as the state in Figure 1A 1, 2, etc.). Then adjust R1 to reduce the plate current value to zero again. At this time, the C voltage must be greater than E1. (Such as Figure 2A E2). According to the AC voltage formula, the increased value (E2-E1) multiplied by 1.414 is equal to the effective value of the external AC voltage.</p>
<p>For example, the initial C voltage E1 is ten volts. After the external high-frequency voltage E is connected, the C voltage E2 increases to twenty volts. According to the above formula, we get:</p>
<p>External high-frequency voltage E = (20 - 10) X 1.414 = 14.14 volts (effective value)</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Key to Private Radio - Ultra-Short Waves <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Guanghua</p>
<p>Today in the twentieth century, whether in war or in peacetime, the transmission of private messages is entirely in the hands of amateur experimenters of ultra-short waves. We know that the distinction of wavelengths is relative, not absolute. Wavelengths below ten meters are so-called ultra-short waves. From ten meters to two hundred meters is a wavelength range used by both police and amateurs. Next is the broadcasting range, and then all the way up to twenty thousand meters are long waves.</p>
<p>After short waves are transmitted, they refract on the surface of the sky and the earth. This refraction altitude is roughly one mile. However, the properties of ultra-short waves are different. After they are transmitted, they do not refract back. Where exactly they go is still an elusive thing. To transmit ultra-short waves, the transmitting and receiving machines must be on the same horizontal line (speaking of private communications).</p>
<p>[Beamcasting] is a specialized term used in ultra-short waves. The method is to transmit speech or music from a weak and invisible beam of light. Dr. D. I. E. Mouromtseff of Westinghouse Radio Company in the United States recently built one, using a wavelength of 109 meters, and performed a demonstration experiment. During beamcasting, he concentrated the .09-meter ultra-short wave on a parabolic mirror, and then concentrated the light from the mirror itself into a long and narrow shape (mostly parallel, and not diffuse). At the same time, inside the ultra-short wave radio receiver, there is also a parabolic mirror that concentrates the light on an antenna less than two inches long. Because the path the light travels is a straight line, this kind of transmission is on the same plane. However, if this equipment is set up higher above the ground, the range can be increased somewhat, which is certain. Therefore, high-rise buildings and the tops of towers and mountain tops are the best locations for beamcasting. Dr. Meng's machine performed well when tested at around one mile. He guessed that reception should also be possible at twenty miles. He said that if the army set up such a device, it would be much more private for transmitting messages. He hopes that the range can be increased further in the near future, so that the time for practical use will not be far off.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Portable Power Supply <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— BF</p>
<p>The power supply described here is manufactured based on the principle of a vibrator transformer. (Please refer to the article "How to Use Transformers for DC Power" in Issue 42 of this publication.)</p>
<p>It can convert low-voltage DC power into high-voltage DC power for plate high-voltage current. This device is simple in construction and can also be connected to AC power lines.</p>
<p>This device connects a common small power transformer, rectifier, and filter in the usual way. Add a six-volt storage battery and a Ford spark coil (Zurich spark coil) connected in series with the storage battery to an unused five-volt coil on the power transformer. The wiring is shown in the attached diagram.</p>
<p>The two sides of the center tap of the power transformer each have three hundred volts. The power supply shown in the diagram can be used directly to supply a small power transmitter. If you want to use it for a radio, you must add a filter choke and an eight-microfarad fixed capacitor: and place the spark coil in the device in a grounded metal box. If this device is used where there is AC power, simply connect the primary of the power transformer to the power line.</p>
<p>The current required for the cathode of the vacuum tube in the machine can also be obtained from this power supply. It is simpler to use a current-type or energy-saving vacuum tube to supply the cathode current with a storage battery or dry battery.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Properties of Ultra-Short Waves <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— VT</p>
<p>The wavelengths of ordinary radio stations are mostly from two hundred meters to six hundred meters. Those longer than this are long waves. Those shorter than this are short waves. After many years of research, it is known that short wavelengths are best suited for long-distance communication. In particular, around 20 meters is suitable for daytime, and around 40 meters is suitable for nighttime. This is due to reflection by the ionosphere. Ten meters or even one meter or less are specifically called ultra-short waves. Their properties are still under research and experimentation. Marconi, who came to China at the end of last year, is working even harder on research. He has done various experiments in the field and already knows that the reflection and refraction of these ultra-short waves are more significant than those of short waves. Therefore, it is often possible to use parabolic reflectors to focus them into a beam and transmit them in a single direction.</p>
<p>The properties of radio waves with a wavelength of less than one meter are almost identical to those of light rays. Therefore, they are also called optical radio waves. We know that the installation of a searchlight is to use a parabolic mirror installed behind the light emitter. The light rays emitted by the light emitter are reflected by the parabolic mirror and then proceed in a single direction. The light power is not lost and can directly illuminate the distance. Similarly, ultra-short waves can also use metal to create parabolic reflecting antennas or reflectors to focus the radio waves into a beam and transmit them in a single direction. At this time, the radio waves are not scattered like ordinary radio waves. Although the power is small, it can directly reach the distance. If a reflector is also used at the receiving end to focus the incoming parallel radio waves on the focal point, the transmitted information can be recovered. This is the point that Marconi is constantly researching.</p>
<p>Several years ago, a light telephone experiment was conducted between the English Channel and the French Channel. It is said to be very effective. This kind of light ray is called MicroRay and is also a type of extremely short radio wave. The antenna used in the experiment was less than one inch long, and the power used was as small as that used in an ordinary flashlight. It is already possible to communicate between two places separated by unobstructed objects. However, how to make these radio waves penetrate obstacles such as hills and buildings, etc., still needs to be researched.</p>
<p>In recent years, research on ultra-short waves has made great progress, and Marconi is a well-known researcher of ultra-short waves. Previous issues of this publication have already introduced this in domestic and foreign news, which you can refer to. If ultra-short waves can be practically used in local communications, it can save electricity and limit the distribution of information (because it is in a single direction). The radio world will usher in a revolution again.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to send and receive ultra-short waves of five meters to seven meters, but the distance is not far. The method will be introduced later. Now, taking advantage of the arrival of inventor Marconi in China, I will briefly describe the so-called name, properties, and reflective antenna principles of ultra-short waves to see the latest research in the radio world. It is hoped that domestic radio comrades can also rise up and catch up.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Sensitive Crystal Radio <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Decan</p>
<p>This circuit diagram is from an American daily mechanical magazine. As a result of the experiment, the sound volume is very loud, and the selectivity is particularly sensitive. It may be more excellent than the excellent crystal radio introduced by Mr. Chun Tong in the 39th issue of this publication. And it is very convenient to manufacture. If a beginner can make one according to this, then all the components except the ore (except for the regenerative radio) can be used when you want to convert it into a one-tube radio.</p>
<p>The parts used are also very simple. The coil L is wound with No. 26 enameled wire on a plastic tube with a diameter of one and a half inches (so as to increase its radio receiving ability when retrofitting a one-tube radio) or a paper tube with 94 turns. L1L2 is wound with No. 32 enameled wire on the same plastic tube, and its diameter is one and a quarter inches. L1 is 107 turns, L2 is 17 turns: the two coils are a quarter inch apart. C can use .0005Mfd, C1 is .00035Mfd, and C2 uses .002Mfd.</p>

<h3 id="e213">(21) Vacuum Tube Radio (1) <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(1) Classification of Vacuum Tube Radios: There are many types of vacuum tube radios. Looking at those sold on the market, there are so-called [several-tube radios] [certain type], etc. Counting them, there are no less than dozens of types. But if they are classified according to the different power supplies, they are nothing more than [DC radio] and [AC radio]. The so-called [DC type] is the one that uses dry batteries or storage batteries for its power supply, while the [AC type] uses AC power from electric lights as its power supply. When broadcast radio was in its infancy, all vacuum tube radios were DC type. Later, due to the feeling of various inconveniences of the DC type, such as the trouble of charging the A battery and the excessive consumption of the B battery, they worked hard to study and finally invented the AC radio. Once the AC type came out, the previous DC type was almost eliminated. In urban areas, the DC type is limited to portable or special mobile use (such as radios in trains and cars).</p>
<p>There are various distinctions between the two major categories of DC and AC radios. The simplest is due to the classification of the number of vacuum tubes, such as calling three-tube radios, five-tube radios, etc., and so on. Although this classification method is extremely simple, there are various methods in the same three-tube radio, and there are also differences in advantages, disadvantages, and functions, so the classification method based on the number of tubes is quite important. If you want to most appropriately indicate the type of vacuum tube radio, you must note the number of vacuum tubes on the one hand, and also note the certain method at the same time.</p>
<p>One thing to note in the classification by the number of vacuum tubes is that on the same machine, the AC radio requires one more tube than the DC radio, that is, the rectifier vacuum tube, which converts the AC power on the power line into DC power.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Influence <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yangling</p>
<p>Artzybasheff said in a letter to a friend:</p>
<p>[People here often think that Nietzsche has had a great influence on me. This surprised me, the simplest reason being that I have never read Nietzsche. I do not sympathize with this prominent thinker, partly in his thoughts and partly in the flamboyant appearance of his works. I stopped reading his book as soon as I started.]</p>
<p>According to some literary critics, Gorky's novels about vagrant life seem to have been influenced by Nietzsche's doctrine. But according to Gorky himself, what influenced him more than the several books about Nietzsche's doctrine he read later was a conversation with a policeman named Nikiforych. At that time, Russian police were the most universally hated and despised, but in this Nikiforych's conversation, there were quite a few points that coincided with the German philosopher's views.</p>
<p>A writer who rejected Nietzsche, and a policeman who may not know Nietzsche's surname, both had Nietzsche's influence seen in their works and conversations, which seems incomprehensible. But the solution is not difficult, just look at the other commonalities of these people.</p>
<p>Gorky is an out-and-out Vadabond, needless to say how a police officer in the Tsarist era was a product of life, which is not difficult to imagine. Artzybasheff, on the other hand, had inherited tuberculosis from his mother since childhood and was poor, [living in a dirty attic without sufficient food.] As for Nietzsche, he had enlisted in the army, and he had also wandered around with a weak body. Like Gorky's university, his [cultural museum] was the whole of Europe.</p>
<p>Consciousness is ultimately a product of existence. How you live determines how you think and what theories you hold. If you have the same life, you will produce the same thoughts. From this point of view, it is natural that some of the thoughts of Gorky, Artzybasheff, Nikiforych, etc. can coincide with Nietzsche.</p>
<p>Ancient books are difficult to read, and philosophy books are even more difficult to read; Nietzsche's philosophy books are particularly difficult to read. If someone wants to understand Nietzsche and goes to read [Thus Spoke Zarathustra] and other books, it is really a difficult and stupid thing. Gorky said that few of the ideas he saw in books were not what he had already heard in real life. But the knowledge in books is ultimately empty talk on paper, far less than the things observed and experienced in real life. Rich in true and active qualities.</p>
<h3 id="e215">How to Study [Art History]? <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Jun</p>
<p>Generally, people who read Western art history either find it [bland and uninteresting] or feel like they are [walking through mud]! Apart from those interested in literature and art, the largest group studying art history are art school students. These students of art history mostly cannot escape the two aforementioned fates. Ten years ago, the author saw students at the Shanghai Art College who would get headaches when they heard about [Art History] class or would doze off during lectures. This is an extremely unfortunate thing in the course of artistic movement. However, this misfortune does not come about by chance, but has various causes and consequences.</p>
<p>[Art] is a specialized discipline. [Art History] is even more specialized. If we want to study [Art History], we must first have some preparation. For example: (1) logical concepts, (2) the budding idea of beauty, (3) pure rational criticism, (4) knowledge of antiquities and anthropology, (5) opportunities to directly interact with works of art, etc.; all of these are things that people who study art history should have in advance.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point – logical concepts – we must have the [understanding] and [systematic concepts] of philosophy and science. At least we should have some familiarity with these two subjects.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point – the budding idea of beauty – this belongs to the realm of aesthetics, that is, those who study Western art history should at least have a general understanding of the recognition of beauty and the principles of beauty.</p>
<p>Regarding the third point – pure rational criticism – that is to say, those who study art history must have a rational certainty in their own minds as the basis for their art criticism.</p>
<p>Regarding the fourth point – antiquities and anthropology are the foundation of history. Art history is certainly no exception. Because to seek the lineage of an artistic trace, these disciplines are necessary knowledge to help him.</p>
<p>Regarding the fifth point – having the opportunity to directly contact works of art – this means that those who study art history can live in an artistic environment, with actual works of art in art museums and exhibitions for them to view and reference.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned aspects are no longer a problem in Western Europe, but in China, they are full of problems!</p>
<p>First, there are very few people who study the theory of beauty. And there are very few people who sincerely study it. So-called theoretical subjects like [aesthetics] are really a kind of [unpopular goods] that are most difficult to sell in Chinese society's marketplace. Therefore, in China, the [aesthetic consciousness] of art historians is extremely difficult to cultivate.</p>
<p>Secondly, China lacks an artistic environment such as [art museums] and [art exhibitions of famous people]. Moreover, there are not a large number of [works] to enrich [art museums] and [art exhibitions] to provide art historians with a kind of research and verification.</p>
<p>These important conditions for studying art history are either not available in China, or are superficially available, but not complete, which is truly the most unfortunate encounter for those studying art history.</p>
<p>In order to break through this situation and make it easier and more interesting for modern Chinese people to study art history, in addition to making the above-mentioned preparations, the methods of teaching art history or compiling art history must also be carefully chosen.</p>
<p>The most important things to pay attention to for those who teach or compile art history are:</p>
<p>(1) The mutual relationship between art in this era and that era.</p>
<p>(2) The causes and consequences of the formation of art, and its development.</p>
<p>(3) The characteristics of art in different eras and regions.</p>
<p>(4) The power of art and its relationship with humanity.</p>
<p>(5) Seeking the essence of [aesthetic consciousness] in the process of art development.</p>
<p>(6) Using the theory of beauty to evaluate the value of a certain art or a certain era's art in a certain region.</p>
<p>(7) Using the entity of works of art to explain the principles of aesthetics.</p>
<p>The above are the minimum requirements that I have for those who teach and compile art history.</p>
<h3 id="e216">On Mirror Lake <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>It was dusk, and the drizzling rain of June fell intermittently, covering the entire Mirror Lake in a layer of rain and mist.</p>
<p>This kind of rain is the most stifling, and for old man Wang, it is even more of a regret: Yellow croaker are only willing to swim to the surface on clear days, but now, they have all sunk to the bottom of the lake.</p>
<p>It seemed that the fishing work could not continue. While rowing the small boat, he collected the [silk nets] that were laid in the lake. After collecting them all, he saw that the fish in the basket were not even half full. After working for most of the day, he had only caught so few fish. A kind of unspeakable sadness penetrated into the depths of his heart, and he immediately sighed:</p>
<p>[Ah! This business, I'm afraid it's not for me.]</p>
<p>And in his practical experience, in recent years, especially recently, the fish seem to be not as plentiful as before. He did not understand why.</p>
<p>With a disappointed and sentimental mood, he rowed the small boat through the willow forest on the edge of the lake, letting the drizzle quietly beat his clothes, rowing straight towards the southeast corner. The oar stroked the lake water, making a flowery sound, constantly turning up some white foam. He was going home. His home was on the ground on the southeast edge of the lake, where an old partner was waiting for him to have dinner.</p>
<p>Thinking of dinner, he knew that there would be nothing satisfactory tonight. The fish from these few days could not be sold or transported out. The fish markets in several towns near the south and north ends of the lake, and Shitou Dianzi, could not sell anything. The people there were all fleeing chaotically to other places. It was said that in Ning'an and Dunhua, Japanese soldiers and righteous armies were fighting fiercely, and the Jingpo Lake area in the middle of these two places was bound to suffer from war. However, old man Wang did not appear flustered because of this. Over the years, he had viewed war very normally. Every summer, battles between soldiers and bandits were bound to happen near the lake, but none of them had affected old man Wang in any way. Until now, he was still working as a fisherman, living with his old partner by fishing.</p>
<p>At this time, the surface of the lake was even more heavily covered by mist. The range that old man Wang's eyes could see was only a small circle around him, but he had long been familiar with the path. Even in the darkest night, he could still row home with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>Several boats rowed past him from the opposite direction. In the dimness, he saw that the boats were loaded with things and crowded with people. The people seemed to have a flustered expression. By the time he wanted to take a closer look at who they were, those boats had already rowed past him and plunged into the thick mist. At the same time, he seemed to hear two loud [thump] [thump] sounds. He was stunned and thought:</p>
<p>[Is that the sound of artillery? Is the war coming?]</p>
<p>He had lived for more than fifty years, and had never really heard the sound of artillery, but in his consciousness, he guessed that only the sound of artillery could be so loud. He thought of the lonely old partner at home, so he hurriedly rowed the boat, rushing home to see how she was.</p>
<p>[Uncle Wang, run quickly, the Japanese soldiers are coming.]</p>
<p>Suddenly, he heard a familiar shout, coming from the surface of the lake, but he could not guess who it was for a moment. Looking around, it was Zhang Liuzi on a boat rowing past nearby who was shouting at him, so busy that he didn't even wait to finish his next sentence before rowing into the thick fog again, leaving him only with the chaotic sound of oars.</p>
<p>This unexpected change came unexpectedly. It seemed to be very serious. He understood that the few boats that had rowed past on the lake just now were escaping. So what should he do? He had an idea.</p>
<p>[There's nothing of value, what's there to be afraid of!]</p>
<p>Having made this decision, he continued to row the boat forward, only feeling that the boat was rowing too slowly. When he rowed to the Tu Kan place, he met his old partner, who was shouting loudly on the Kan, so that he could break through the fog and get her on the boat. The house at home was burned, the Japanese soldiers said because they were afraid of harboring righteous armies in the future. He was stunned after hearing what his old partner said. He had no idea what to do, and could only row the boat in the opposite direction, as if that way he could find a place to belong.</p>

<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>Qin devoured the six states, and the scholars of the six states hated Qin. I remember this as the starting line of Gu Yanwu's "Emperor Qin's Journey". In my humble opinion, those who hate Qin are not limited to the six states. It can even be said that Qin is the public enemy of scholars since annexing the six states. The articles cursing Qin that are still often recited by people today are Jia Yi's "The Faults of Qin" and Du Mu's "Ode to the Afang Palace", which are especially outstanding. I also recited these two articles when I was young. I once wrote a historical poem, one of which says:</p>
<p>What harm is there in trying to speak once?</p>
<p>Meeting on the Yi River opens up the path to hegemony.</p>
<p>Even the First Emperor's whip that moved the stone causes it to bleed,</p>
<p>Huangshi deliberately brings his hatred!</p>
<p>My teachers and friends praised it, but I didn't boast about it much, just kept the manuscript. As I grew older and read more books, I began to know that many good works by predecessors mentioned the affairs of Emperor Qin. I was most influenced by three quatrains, one by Zhang Jie about burning books and burying scholars:</p>
<p>The bamboo and silk texts are burned, the imperial dream gone,</p>
<p>The passes and rivers lock the First Emperor's abode in vain.</p>
<p>The ashes in the pits are not yet cold, and Shandong is in chaos,</p>
<p>Liu and Xiang, in the end, did not read books!</p>
<p>One by Chen Fuzhi about Bolangsha:</p>
<p>A bold spirit to strike the carriage,</p>
<p>The First Emperor's state was already shaken.</p>
<p>How is it that beyond the twelve bronze men,</p>
<p>There is still iron in the human world that has not been melted!</p>
<p>One by Chen Gongyin about reading the Annals of Qin:</p>
<p>Slander is easy to dispel, but resentment is hard to remove,</p>
<p>Qin's laws were strict, but also quite lax.</p>
<p>Calling for a child by the bridge in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>There are still books in the human world that have not been burned!</p>
<p>This poem "[there are still books in the human world that have not been burned]," and the previous poem "[there is still iron in the human world that has not been melted]" seem to share the same meaning, but they do not seem to be copying each other, because one praises burning books, and the other praises destroying weapons. A certain Mr. of the Beiyang Army, who was also quite capable of writing poetry, wrote a quatrain about burning books:</p>
<p>Whose argument from Jixia should be taken?</p>
<p>The First Emperor burned it all in a torch!</p>
<p>If we were to discuss the merits and demerits of burning books,</p>
<p>It would be worth half the effort of deleting books.</p>
<p>This poem somewhat overturns the case of burning books. If the First Emperor were resurrected, he would surely be delighted. He would surely treat such literati as Li Si did, and the pit for burying the living would certainly not be set up for them. Who said that in the era of the tyrannical Qin, all Confucian scholars were buried?</p>

<p>[If it were possible, I would very much like to depart on this mail ship.]</p>
<p>Zhean asked him,</p>
<p>[Why can't you?]</p>
<p>[Because I don't know anyone at the Atlantic mail ship company.]</p>
<p>Luo Lan asked in surprise,</p>
<p>[And all your great plans for success? Have you abandoned them all?]</p>
<p>Bi'er said in a low voice,</p>
<p>[Sometimes we must know how to sacrifice everything, to abandon even the best hopes. And, this is just a beginning, a means of earning a few francs in preparation for starting my own business later.]</p>
<p>His father was immediately convinced by his words:</p>
<p>[That's right. In two years, you can save six or seven thousand francs, and if this money is used well, your future is limitless. What do you think, Louise?]</p>
<p>She replied in a low, almost inaudible voice:</p>
<p>[I think what Bi'er said makes sense.]</p>
<p>Luo Lan called out,</p>
<p>[But I'll go talk to Mr. Punan about this, I know him very well! He is a judge of the Commercial Court and he takes on matters for the ship company. I also know the shipowner, Mr. Le Yang, who is very close to a vice-chairman.]</p>
<p>Zhean asked his brother,</p>
<p>[Is it okay if I go sound out Mr. Ma Shang today?]</p>
<p>[Okay.]</p>
<p>Bi'er thought for a moment and then said,</p>
<p>[I'm afraid the best way would still be to write a letter to my professors at the medical university, they all value me very much. The doctors who go to these ships are usually mediocre characters. If Professors Maslosser, Le Miozo, Flasche, and Poligel write enthusiastic letters of introduction, it will definitely be more reliable and faster than all unreliable requests. All that is needed is for your friend, Mr. Ma Shang, to present this letter to the board of directors.]</p>
<p>Zhean fully agreed:</p>
<p>[Your idea is excellent, excellent!]</p>
<p>So he smiled, relieved, because he was convinced that it would succeed, and he almost felt satisfied, for he could not be worried for long.</p>
<p>[Are you going to write to them today?] he said.</p>
<p>[I'll write in a while, right away. I don't want to drink coffee this morning, I'm too nervous.]</p>
<p>He got up and went out.</p>

<p>— Nanhai Shaou</p>
<p>The pain of unemployment and the competition for survival have always been unfolding incessantly, both at home and abroad, in ancient and modern times. Especially accompanied by the modern trend of sharp material enjoyment, all kinds of contradictions go to extremes; that kind of competition and unruly movement become more intense.</p>
<p>The successful people in the city, on the summit, in the ivory palace, in the gentle country, enjoy the heavenly life of happiness to the fullest. The unsuccessful people are eternally trapped in the downtrodden and impoverished lower class.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who carry guns use the unemployed and helpless peasants as a talisman for their leopard and tiger tents, trampling on the accumulated white bones of generals and soldiers to climb to heaven because of material desires. The comrades in literary attire who hold seven-inch writing brushes cling to the banners of the armed comrades, hitching a ride, shouting the slogan of [liberating the masses], following each other to dust off their hats and enter the palace.</p>
<p>By the time they enter the hall and chamber, they lose their footing in the crowded heavens and fall out of the sky. Waking up from a bewildered dream, seeing the desolation, dryness, and embarrassment of the mortal world, and reminiscing about the splendor and comfort of heavenly life, the fire of restless thoughts cannot be dismissed at any moment, and they finally reach out their ape arms, somersaulting and riding the auspicious clouds, coming for another round!</p>
<p>For these moments that seem so important, all kinds of patterns are churning like waves without stopping.</p>
<p>The [epicenter] is born from this point. How can this [epicenter] be brought to extinction? Please ask those who read the Spring and Autumn Annals!</p>

<p>— Chun Liu</p>
<p>In Dai Jitao's autobiography, [My Reading Notes], we can roughly learn about his childhood life. Dai Jitao is undoubtedly from Wuxing, but he was born in Guanghan County, Sichuan. His family was very poor when he was young. He lost his grandfather at the age of six. His father was imprisoned in the ritual office of the state for two years because of disputes left by his grandfather. Jitao also attended on him in custody. At that time, he was only eleven years old. He studied very hard and had a high talent. He even listed grand books such as "Wenxian Tongkao" and "Fangyu Jiyao" as ancient prose courses. He lost his father at the age of thirteen. His brother ordered him to enter the Dongyou Preparatory School in Chengdu to prepare to learn Japanese well, and then go to Japan to study. At the age of fourteen, he transferred to the Chengdu Kejiji School, but was expelled for starting a student movement. At the age of fifteen, he became a Japanese translator in a middle school with the introduction of a Japanese, Xiao Ya Sanqi. His brother saw that he was very promising, so he sold thirty mu of sand fields in his home, earning seven hundred yuan, to pay for his study abroad in Japan. At that time, his grandmother was still alive and resolutely forbade him to travel far. As a result, the brothers colluded and let him run away secretly.</p>
<p>He studied in Japan for four years and returned to China at the age of nineteen, teaching in a specialized school in Suzhou. Later, with the introduction of Mr. Hong Foshe, he joined "Tianduo Newspaper" as editor-in-chief, which was the beginning of his life as a journalist. He was twenty-one years old at that time.</p>

<p>— Bi Weng</p>
<p>In the center of Nanjing Road in Shanghai, there is a place with a long history called [Rising Sun Building]. Mentioning this name is truly known to both women and children. But this noisy Rising Sun Teahouse, somehow, transformed itself two years ago, becoming [Fanghu Wine Lodge], and soon became [Nanyue Restaurant]. Fortunately, after tea and wine, these are all matters of the states of Lu and Wei, and there is no need to get to the bottom of it. The worldwide recession has also affected our most prosperous Nanjing Road. The flags of big discounts are commonplace, and the tricks of big sales are endless. We often see a certain Hua Silk Shop with what [Clearance Sale]? What [Entrusted Consignment Sale by a Certain Factory in the Ninth District]? What [Shareholders Disagree, Implementing a Big Sacrifice?] All kinds of incoherent announcements are changing every day. Those who know the situation are secretly snickering; but they are simply unspeakably miserable! The rent is so expensive, and the staff cannot be cut any more. Expenses are necessary. The goods placed in the display window cannot be converted into gold yuan. If they don't come up with moving slogans like this, who would be willing to stop?</p>
<p>At any tram stop, there are beggars with their hands outstretched asking for copper coins, standing guard there; but in secret, they are all striking matches to smoke cigarettes, alas! Cigarettes are not food, they can't save this generation of beggars. They are simply pathetic and unworthy of pity. Sometimes, the detectives of the patrol house are disturbed, and a large prison van drives over, and they are all arrested, big and small, male and female, indiscriminately. At that time, if they resist a little bit, five cigars are awarded, the taste of which seems to be even better than cigarettes. I cannot make a judgement on this question.</p>
<p>We often see in foreign films that Chinese children are portrayed as being very skilled at playing with three small knives, up and down, catching three blades with both hands, very flexibly; this is the trick that little beggars use to beg for money from foreigners; foreigners have this deeply imprinted in their minds, and it represents the playthings of Chinese children; this is such a shameful and prejudiced thing! Speaking of the stubbornness of foreigners and their inability to understand the progress of the Chinese era, it can be seen everywhere, such as the paintings recently posted by the Public Works Department on trams or poles, warning Chinese children to get vaccinated quickly; the clothing and hats of the children are simply still before the Republic of China; and the greeting cards in Christmas gifts also have the clothing of my Chinese compatriots that are separated from the times by at least ten years.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Looking at Advertisements <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Newspapers are centered on news, but they cannot be separated from advertisements. Therefore, when we buy a newspaper, in addition to reading the news, we can also look at the colorful advertisements; and we may even buy cheap goods from the advertisements, or even make unexpected windfalls. As for which, news or advertisements, is more loved by people, although it seems not easy to determine: there are also traces to be found. In short, in a country in times of peace, the advertisements on newspapers are always more than the news; conversely, the news is always more than the advertisements. Therefore, the rise and fall of a country's fortune can be easily followed by this track. This is the experience I have gained from reading newspapers for decades. If I want to give an example, I can briefly describe it as follows:</p>
<p>In the year of Xinhai, the Wuchang Uprising broke out. The newspapers were full of articles competing to publish the news that a certain province was independent and that someone had revolted, which made people's eyebrows dance when they read it. Therefore, people who care about national affairs all want to compete to read the news as soon as they get the newspaper. As for advertisements, except for [foreign currency exchange rates] which are worth paying attention to by those who care about finance, the rest, 8</p>
<p>At that time, he had to let the news take the lead alone.</p>
<p>Also, in the year when the [January 28th] incident occurred, I was trapped in a certain rear area. One day, I went to the YMCA and saw thousands of people crowded together, some of whom were still mumbling in their mouths. It turned out that a Shanghai newspaper was stuck on the wall. This newspaper was brought back from the front line. At that time, everyone cared about the news from the front line; I think even if the newspaper was full of eye-catching 8</p>
<p>Advertisements, I am afraid that no one would pay attention to them.</p>
<p>From the above two examples, it can be proved that when the country is in trouble, the people value news and ignore advertisements. Conversely, the domain of news in newspapers is gradually occupied by advertisements, which may be a sign of peace in the world. Therefore, we don't need to sigh [nothing to see], nor do we need to hold the heart of [worrying about the sky falling], it is better to look at the advertisements more, and when we encounter something we love, whether it is for eating or using, we might as well buy more. You must know how many lives there are, why bother yourself? Knowing this is worthy of reading the newspaper, worthy of reading the advertisements on the newspaper.</p>

<p>A woman who is tired of socializing said: Arranged by parents, marrying a man she doesn't know; it may be better than a man she is already familiar with. Because their friendship and love happened at the same time.</p>

<p>Chapter 21: Whispered Words by the Lamp, Heartfelt Advice to the Weak Child / Leaning on a Staff, Watching Heroes with Cold Eyes Down the Mountain</p>
<p>Guizhi was listening in bed and couldn't bear it anymore. She sat up with a flip, pushed her half-untidy hair to her cheeks, and said with a straight face: Look at you, old man, the more you talk, the more unpleasant it becomes. What indecent thing did I do! It won't work, don't shout too much, from tomorrow onwards, I am determined not to take a step out of the gate. If I step out of the gate, I will not die a good death in this life. There are several bottles of floral water, snow cream jars, etc. by the pit. Guizhi picked up one at hand and smashed it on the ground with a snap. Pointing to the ground, she said: If I don't mean what I say, I'll be like this bottle. Ms. Jiang thought that her daughter had received a lesson and was quite proud of herself. She had a belly full of words to be vented and wanted to take this opportunity to say them all. Unexpectedly, the girl suddenly resisted so violently that it made her stop speaking, but it was not good, and it was also not good to continue speaking. So she blushed, stood up and looked at Guizhi and said: What do you mean by this? When you get married, you will soon be an adult. Can you be so unreasonable to your superiors? When you get older in the future, will you be able to accept it if your subordinates treat you like this? Guizhi said: I didn't say that your words were bad. 8</p>
<p>Because your words are right, and I am afraid that you will not worry about me, so I smashed this perfume bottle to show that I have made up my mind. Ms. Jiang stood under the lamp, her face red and white with anger, but since the girl had lost her temper, she was afraid that she would shout if she continued to talk to her, which would be even more inconvenient. She put her hands behind her back and supported the table, sneering: Look, this half-head is rebellious. Guizhi shook her head slightly and said: Not rebellious at all, I am telling the truth. Ms. Jiang saw that the girl's attitude was still so stubborn, and wanted to say two more sentences. But she heard Zhao Weng coughing several times in the back yard. (284)</p>

<p>丨Market Shows Signs of Drying Up丨</p>
<p>丨A Drop of $11.60丨</p>
<p>Although the gold market declined yesterday, the day's market conditions were still obscure. In reality, while there were many sellers, a significant portion was largely hedging exchange bills, which provided substantial support. This led to more active bargain hunting, and the market showed slight signs of drying up, resulting in a stable situation. At the beginning of the morning, although overseas silver markets in the UK and US both declined, the forward silver price on the Gold Exchange actually rose by 0.04 to 0.045, and exchange rates also increased. The pure gold price remained unchanged, but US cotton rose by more than a point per pound, and US wheat also increased. Stocks declined slightly. Wool futures opened lower but remained above $80. Subsequently, due to slightly worse news from foreign telegrams, they fell further. After the opening, although Reuters had a message about US Senators King and Wheeler proposing free coinage of silver, the telegram ended with a message that after Senator Rubin spoke with the President, he told people that this bill might not be introduced in the current Congress. Although it declined, it remained stable. Subsequently, due to the US dollar exchange rate rising and rumors worsening, it fell, but banks had a good appetite, hedging activities stabilized the market, and the after-market was even stronger. The day's market conditions were mediocre, with the spot price being $1055. Now, the day's market conditions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opened at $675, down $12.40 from the previous close. Goods opened at $5.50. The exchange market opened with near-term selling rates of British pounds at 1 shilling 4 pence 0.0625, and US dollars at $34.50. The domestic market gradually loosened. Hengxing and Huixiang sold on the market, while Bingxing, Yuanmao, and Yongfeng bought. Zhengjin sold US dollars for April delivery at 0.5, hovering around $5.00. At this time, due to advance knowledge that HSBC had raised its listed rates for British pounds by 0.125 and US dollars by 0.0625, there was a temporary decline, but Hongli, Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yong, and others actively purchased, causing it to rise to $5.70. Foreign telegrams also brought news of free coinage of silver. Huixiang, Zhaofeng, Changda, Decheng, Ruixing, Daxing, Yongyuan, Maoyong, Yiyong, Yu, and others continuously sold, and the exchange market loosened. Zhengjin offered US dollars for February delivery at $35.00, and for March at $35.375, causing it to fall to $1.70. Yida, Yong, Hongli, Zhifeng, Yong, Hengyu, and Hengxing took advantage of the low prices to purchase. Huabi sold US dollars for May delivery at $35.9375, and it rebounded to $4.70, but there were many long positions. When Mitsui sold US dollars for May delivery at $35.875, Qianchangxiang, Zhaofengchang, and others purchased, causing it to rise to above $5.00. Hengyu, Bingxing, Yuanmao, Yong, Zhifeng, Yong, and others sold again at high prices, causing it to retreat to $3.00. Meifeng sold US dollars for April delivery at $35.625, and Fuyu gradually increased its purchases, causing it to rebound to $4.80.

Although Yuanmao, Yong sold, it still gradually rose from $3.10 to around $5.00. Afterwards, Huabi purchased US dollars for March delivery at $35.3125, and Mitsui took May delivery at $35.875. Hengxing, Xiexing, Yongyi, Dayong, and others competed to purchase, causing it to rise to $6.70. Yuanmao, Yong still sold, and Cuitai, Hengxing, and Hongxing also sold, causing it to fall again to $4.90. Zhengjin continuously sold US dollars for May delivery at $35.875. Qianchangxiang, Yuanmao, Yiyu took advantage of the low prices to buy again, and it rebounded to $6.50 after struggling. The closing price was $675.80, with goods trading at $5.70. After the market closed, Wanxing suddenly sold aggressively, and Hengyu, Yuanmao, and Yong also provided supply, gradually retreating to $4.00. The highest price of the day was $676.70, and the lowest was $671.70, a difference of $5.00. As a result, it fell $11.60 compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The announced price, due to HSBC Bank raising its listed US dollar rate by 0.0625 to $34.00, meant the gold price was weakly at $706.00.

Only Dadecheng and Taikangcheng sold about 400 taels to Yingfeng and Hengyue for $1052.50. This was local merchandise, and the market was sluggish. There are currently 1,841 vouchers remaining for this month.</p>
<p>In the market, the supply side was stronger. Overall, Yuanmao Shui, Dadecheng, Huixiang, Ruikang, Changsheng, Shuiyuan, Maoshun, Maoshui, Desen, Changyong, Yifengyong, Futaiheng, Zhifengyong, and others were on the selling side.

<p>But New Customs Bonds Fall by 1 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to some progress in the current situation, the recovery of Taishun boosted morale.

<p>U.S. Cotton Short Covering Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market initially fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, but rebounded due to short covering and speculative buying. As a result, current prices rose by 20 points, and futures prices rose by 14 to 23 points. Liverpool Cotton 8</p>
<p>Current prices rose by 8 points, and futures prices fell by 1 to 3 points. Egyptian cotton current prices rose by [illegible] 2</p>
<p>Points. The Mumbai cotton market initially rose due to speculative buying, but fell due to long liquidation and selling by Japanese merchants. As a result, Pingar remained unchanged, Gumla rose by 2 rupees and 2.5 corners, and Bailoxi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 4th):</p>

<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices continued to show a favorable trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat was also up about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Market sentiment is such that, although foreign wheat is being imported continuously, with about five or six ships currently unloading, the mills' chips have mostly been hedged in advance. And a part of 8</p>
<p>The small highs are due to the big factories buying in this month, and they are also working hard to replenish distant months. Prices in all months look favorable, down about 0.02 yuan from the previous day. By the afternoon, with some Northern merchants making small purchases recently and small factories still buying distant months, the prices for January and February rose another 0.01 yuan. Subsequently, due to long positions 8</p>
<p>Prices receded, and prices for all months were weak again. Looking at the steps going forward, we will temporarily watch the trading situation. As a result, this month is down 0.025 yuan from the previous day, February is down 0.015 yuan, March is down 0.0175 yuan, April and May are up 0.0225 yuan, and June is up 0.0175 yuan.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the market for all months looked favorable. Since the current inventory of domestic wheat is no longer abundant, general sentiment is also shifting. Therefore, whether or not they dare to sell off, even those in the industry cannot lightly try. Although the import of foreign wheat is quite smooth, most of it belongs to factories, and the exchange's standards should not be affected. Therefore, after a period of silence, sentiment has rebounded sharply. Opening prices for January and February were up 0.03 to 0.09 yuan. New wheat in June also looked good after initial fatigue. In the afternoon, trading in each session was dismal, with only February and March being done. The remainder 8</p>
<p>Both were empty. As a result, February rose 0.09 yuan, March rose 0.09 yuan, and the rest did not open. The current wheat market is still loose, as small factories are not buying in, and large factories 8</p>
<p>Slightly socialized. The opening price of Yangzhou wheat is 3.9 yuan, Yaowan wheat is 3.9 yuan 8</p>
<p>, and Nansuzhou wheat is 3.95 yuan, with 2,500 bags being handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Late Crop Continues to Rise, Remaining Prices Flat <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of more than 60 ships from various gangs arrived, carrying about 8,000 shi. Demand for late rice from merchants continued to be healthy, so the situation was tight. It is estimated that the Northern Sea, Tanggu, Tianjin, Yantai, and Weihaiwei gangs, as well as the Southern Sea, Xiamen, and Shantou gangs, successively entered more than 3,000 bags, totaling 4,000 to 5,000 shi. Initially, the sellers had a strong attempt to push prices up, but in the end, because sentiment was not firm, the market only slightly increased by 0.03 yuan. Medium-grade goods such as Xilian and Fengjing 8</p>
<p>Were all purchased by the street, and the after-market is difficult to be optimistic about. Thick japonica and Duyang 8</p>
<p>Points are still oversupplied, and the market is showing a downward trend. Yin Bian Yuan's sales are slightly sluggish, and the market is trending weak.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There were 36 to 37 sources from various roads. Consumption of all colors in the market is continuing, and white japonica, foreign Dufu, Kejian white yuan, yin yuan, etc. are stable. Early thin rice 8</p>
<p>Slightly lower by a few points.</p>

<p>▲ Market Changes from Weak to Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the gradual decline in market prices and abundant inventory in the customer indica market, sales began in this street and demand from hoarding customers. River factory rice has already been purchased by hoarding customers and is being packed and loaded on board every day. The street dislikes the difficulty in selecting the rice, and pays more attention to customer indica. Yesterday, the price of customer indica was flat and weak. Once the hoarding purchases in this street took notice, the market immediately changed from weak to stable, and from stable to standing. The selling open 8</p>
<p>The situation is similar to the previous market, but sentiment is good and the market is active. If a large gang purchases the entire hoard, the market price can increase. Yesterday, the entire day's transaction volume was 296 bags of Wuhu Yuan rice, priced at 7.68 yuan; 218 bags of Jiangxi machine early rice, priced at 6.09 yuan; and 100 bags of Hunan machine oil rice, priced at 7.35 yuan. Additionally, 300 bags of machine red rice, priced at 6.7 yuan; and 100 bags of machine Jing rice, priced at 7 yuan. The price of the middle grades decreased accordingly. Among them, the machine Jing rice was handled by the Quanzhou gang, and the rest were purchased by this street.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Yellow Beans Arrive Less, Market Flat <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of yellow beans was not surging, and the market was stable. The total transaction volume for each bean wheel 8</p>
<p>The total number of vehicles was 11 to 12, including 3 vehicles of Zhengyangguan beans, priced at 3.58</p>
<p>.5 yuan to 4.8 yuan; 1 vehicle of Feihe beans, also priced at 3.48 yuan; 2 vehicles of Yingzhou beans, priced at 3.45 yuan and 4.2 yuan; 1 vehicle of Dangshan beans, priced at 3.4 yuan. Apart from Zhengyangguan beans being exported and 2 vehicles being distributed by this street, the rest were handled by inland shops. There was also 1 vehicle of Haozhou beans, priced at 3.23 yuan; 2 vehicles of Gaogeng beans, priced at 3.338</p>
<p>.5 yuan and 0.33 yuan; and 2 vehicles of Bengbu beans, priced at 3.2 yuan, which were intended for this street, and the factory was not moving. The Yong gang was active in handling Shahuang beans, and the market was flat. The transaction volume of Dufu beans was sparse, and the market saw little change.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the sugar market, benchmark prices fell again, while the exchange rate for Dutch currency slightly increased. The overall trend remained weak. The guild set the price for No. 24 coarse granulated white common goods at 19 yuan, 2 jiao, 8 fen, a decrease of 5 fen compared to the previous day. No. 89 Dutch red common goods were priced at 15 yuan, 8 jiao, a decrease of 1 jiao compared to the previous day. Taikoo sugar decreased by 4 fen: B mark was at 20 yuan, 0 jiao, 4 fen; CW mark was at 19 yuan, 9 jiao. The local factory's refined white sugar decreased again by 1 jiao: Zhenji No. 1 was at 18 yuan, 3 jiao; No. 2 was at 1 jiao; No. 3 was at 17 yuan, 9 jiao; No. 4 was at 7 jiao. The market for domestically produced Chaozhou green sugar stabilized slightly. The opening price for over two hundred packages of Hong Kong green sugar decreased to 12 yuan to 11 yuan, 9 jiao. Slab green sugar, which had opened at 9 yuan, 6 jiao at the end of last year, fell 3 or 4 jiao lower than Chaozhou green sugar after the customs closure period. Naturally, it is difficult to expect such low-grade goods to stabilize. Therefore, yesterday's market saw a sharp drop of 6 jiao, with over three hundred pieces offered by Guangdong merchant houses at a price of 9 yuan.</p>

<p>Although sun-dried round meat from Xiamen is scarce, it has been affected by the frequent drops in other types of round meat, making it difficult to maintain the original price. Yesterday, it was reported that merchant houses' prices had slightly decreased, down another 3 or 4 yuan from the previous price. The market price also loosened accordingly, with the price of Ma Yuan meat also decreasing by 1 or 2 yuan. Both cargo owners and customers are reportedly suffering losses.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Silk and Tea, Silk Cocoon Merchants Plan to Establish an Exchange <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>▲ Overseas Silk Still Has No Turning Point</p>
<p>(Silk Cocoon Exchange Actively Being Organized) With the sluggish sales of Xianmei silk, the sericulture industry in our country is on the verge of total collapse. At the end of last year, the silk factories' trade associations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces held a joint meeting in Shanghai and decided to organize a silk cocoon exchange to seek a way to save the industry. Yesterday, when interviewed, Mr. Shen Huachen, chairman of the Shanghai Silk Factories' Trade Association, said that the matter of the silk cocoon exchange is now being handled by a committee including Zhou Qianchu, who is drafting the articles of association, and Chen Zezhong, Zhang Yunsheng, and Chen Bingruo, who are reviewing them. The planned capital is 250,000 yuan. Once the drafting is completed, another meeting will be held to discuss and prepare, and then it will be submitted to the Ministry of Industry for registration. From this, it can be seen that the opening date should not be far off.</p>
<p>(Over a Hundred Pieces of Silk Waste Shipped to Mumbai) This time, the British mail ships Bengal No. 1 and No. 2 exported a total of 125 pieces of long silk cocoons and silk waste, owned by Anli and others, destined for Mumbai.</p>
<p>(Futures Sales of Artificial Silk Gradually Rising in Spring) Since the New Year, inland merchants' appetite for artificial silk futures has gradually increased. Yesterday, merchants from Yantai and other places bought 34 cases of Jin Qilin, Black Beauty, and Flying Elephant brands, weighing one hundred pounds per case, for January and February delivery, at prices ranging from 198 yuan, 2 jiao, 5 fen to 184 yuan, 7 jiao, 5 fen net (goods numbered 80 to 200).</p>
<p>(Sales of Coarse Silk for Printing Remain Flat and Weak) In the overseas raw silk market, after the New Year's opening, the silk shops' appetite remains sluggish. Warehouses still have ample silk inventory. The opening price of Japanese silk in New York is difficult to increase, and actual sales in Lyon have not picked up, so prices remain low. Sales of European and American silk still lack any turning point. The market atmosphere in Shanghai remains weak, and few silk telegrams are being sent. Yesterday, only printing houses bought 11 packages of yellow and white silk, with the red market price remaining flat and weak.</p>

<p>The tea market of foreign firms in this port has been weak for a long time. Since the New Year, there has been no good news. The Casablanca market is experiencing sluggish tea sales, and merchants are not only unwilling to buy large quantities of Chinese tea, but are also sending telegrams to stop the shipment of previously purchased goods. In addition, the situation is unstable and financing is drying up, so both Chinese and foreign tea merchants are pessimistic about the future of the tea market. Yesterday, the whole city saw only Jinlong and Fuchang buy 50 boxes of needle tips and shrimp eyes to replenish their stocks, with prices dropping 3-4 yuan to 5-6 yuan compared to last year.</p>

<p>Rambling Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e261">This Year's Women and Children <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhai</p>
<p>Because this year is [Women's National Products Year] and [Children's Year], therefore [women], who have always been despised by some moralists, and [children], who have been ignored by many people, have actually [climbed to the peak of the times] and become objects that people often mention or write about.</p>
<p>Fairly speaking, who dares to say that women should not use national products? Who also says that the happiness of children should not be valued? However, in our complex and turbulent country, where beautiful arguments are often slapped in the face by facts with [cigars], these are all [major problems]!</p>
<p>First, let's talk about women and national products: The [patriotic people] have been using [national products to save the country] to replace [resisting Japan] for two years now. But in the actual situation, we still only see the [daily decline] of national industries, the overwhelming import of Japanese goods, and the [way to make money] of many traitors. This iron-like fact is enough to prove that the wealthy and profit-seeking class of Chinese society has long been dead at heart and its blood is cold. The [life philosophy] of the group of traitors is simply [ancestral graves can be dug up, but Japanese goods cannot be sold]! Therefore, last year's [National Products Year], which was very vigorous, did not turn out to be [good and wonderful]. Now, the [equal rights for men and women] of [National Products Year] is split into [Women's National Products Year], so what will be the future result? Alas! If I say it bluntly, it will inevitably [spoil people's fun]; if I don't say it, it will be somewhat [like a fishbone in my throat]! First, the daily necessities, especially luxury goods, of foreigners are both expensive and [good], and have long become an [indispensable] [life element] for women in the upper class of Chinese society, who take pleasure and indulgence as their principle! Now, to promote [Women's National Products Year], in fact, those noble ladies and celebrities will inevitably be [excluded] and cannot be counted on. Second, because of the dumping of foreign goods with good quality and low prices, and the exploitation of national products with numerous checkpoints, the daily necessities of the middle and lower classes are actually mostly more expensive for national products than foreign goods. Therefore, to require poor women who are on the verge of bankruptcy and whose purchasing power is extremely weak to [use national products only] for the sake of [patriotism], which they don't quite understand, seems impractical. As a result, [Women's National Products Year] cannot but be truncated, targeting a part of the petty-bourgeois women who are slightly knowledgeable and can afford national products. Therefore, I am afraid that not many [national industrialists] will be created from [Women's National Products Year]? At the same time, the number of imported goods will not necessarily be slightly reduced because of the loud call of [Women's National Products Year]? However, I still hope that my prediction is [wrong]!</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about [Children's Year]: Now, it is a disastrous era of universal bankruptcy, with most people falling into the path of hungry ghosts. Among the 400 million people, at least 350 million people's children are trapped in the hellish life of insufficient food and clothing, starvation, scavenging garbage, pulling rickshaws, and being maids and prostitutes. Therefore, in fact, most of China's children have become [semi-beggars]. The [interests] of these children, unless China's politics and people's livelihood have a way out, will never be guaranteed. Now, I think that the most practical task for enthusiastic [child care] volunteers is not how to sing loudly about [Children's Year], but to run a few more civilian day and night schools, prohibit the abuse and sale of children, and find some [drop in the bucket] relief for unfortunate children who are out of school and starving. Being able to do these things is already a great act of [merit for countless generations of nobles and marquises], who would dare to expect so much from [Children's Year]! As for those [children's paradises] displayed in major companies and the [scientific] food, clothing, housing, and transportation of children, which are calculated in dollars, they are just to find a little more fun for the [little darlings] of the rich. In fact, these [darlings] have long been wanted by their parents to be held in their mouths, and even without promoting [Children's Year], they are already happy to the [special first class], why would they need volunteers to brag about it in such a serious way!</p>
<p>What I have seen in [Women's National Products Year] and [Children's Year] is just [that's all]!</p>
<h3 id="e262">Shadows on the Dry Bridge <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Old Brand</p>
<p>For four full months, I had to cross this dry bridge twice a day on time.</p>
<p>The reputation of the job of begging for a living was not bad, but the salary was so low that it made people ashamed, and the agency was located in the most affluent area, where it was simply impossible to solve the problem of food and accommodation. The fact forced me to live far away in the home of a fellow villager in North Shanghai, and run back and forth on time every day, crossing this dry bridge twice a day on time.</p>
<p>Originally, I should have crossed it four times, but because my legs were too sore from running, and two blisters the size of silver dollars appeared on the soles of my feet, I changed my mind, preferring to endure one hunger in the middle of the day, saving two trips. At about nine o'clock every morning, after eating a meal that was neither early nor late, I set off to do the [immovable] official business. It took about half an hour to run on the dirty road to reach the foot of the dry bridge, which naturally provided an opportunity to [rest a little]. Alas, the people crossing the bridge were so crowded! The warm sun slowly rose high from the east, calling up the coolies, rickshaw pullers, laborers, vendors, and all kinds of other coolies in the stacked slums of North Shanghai, carrying various tools, gathered on the narrow roads leading to the foot of the bridge, layer by layer close to each other. When they reached the section near the foot of the bridge, they became in a situation of [buttocks touching buttocks and heads bumping heads]. When time was running out, I was one of the members of this situation. Since people were so crowded, everyone wanted to squeeze past first, but the fact just didn't allow it. After a while of chaos, first, a string of [national curses] was practiced: [Mom's] [dog's X] from Jiangbei people, [X your mother's X] from Shandong guys, [X your mother] from Guangdong oldies, [Mom selling X's] from Hunan people, [X your sister] from Hubei buddies; if it was more fierce, people would roll down from the bridge to the foot of the bridge one by one. Then [cursing] stopped abruptly, and only the sound of punching and kicking was heard, as chaotic as boiling smoke, and traffic was virtually cut off, so that everyone could not cross over.</p>
<p>When I encountered this kind of occasion, I had to avoid the road, took a big circle, and detoured from the railway station side, and I could still vaguely see that it was so chaotic, as if they were sworn enemies, with no end to the quarrel.</p>
<p>However, this was not the case every day. On some days, everyone was particularly polite, almost to the point of [using force], but after all, they passed peacefully by accident. Then there were two stereotyped sentences that came out of everyone's mouth one by one, which were: [We are all family, let's just muddle through!]. The crowded people walked past one by one in this crowded sound.</p>
<p>On a certain day, I went a little late. When I stepped onto the top of the bridge, I saw a group of vendors picking up their scattered belongings with tearful faces. I asked them what was the reason, whether they had been kicked over by the police. They said: [No, the police don't come at this time. Originally, we could freely peddle on this bridge, but we encountered a group of people crossing the bridge who fought for the lead, knocking over all our belongings, and everyone ran away.] [Oh, so that's it. There was another riot this morning!] This impression will never be forgotten by me! Every morning when I passed there, I not only became wary myself, but also worried a lot about those vendors.</p>
<p>At night, at about ten o'clock late at night, I crossed this dry bridge again with a tired and hungry body. However, at this time, it was much quieter, also because I was eager to rush back to eat, and rarely paid attention to the people around me. Under the bleak electric torch, everything presented a dim sense of gloom and panic. On the top of the bridge, occasionally one or two vendors were calling out to sell in a halting voice, and more were barefoot blind people and all kinds of other compatriots who were begging for food, arranging their sleep</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>equipment, arranging them side by side, one after another. Also, there were always two or three fellow countrymen who were so leisurely, leaning on the bridge railing in neat clothes, whispering to each other, as if they were shouldering some kind of mission, and were waiting for something. That was probably the gentlemen of the Shanghai night, I thought.</p>
<p>I noticed very carefully that very few Western-dressed people crossed this dry bridge, and even fewer modern girls. However, it gave me a very deep impression, and its relationship with me was very close! Hastily, I haven't crossed it for a year, but it is forever and ever engraved in my heart.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Newspapers and Textbooks <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Chen</p>
<p>Knowing that newspapers are a kind of textbook is a major improvement I have made recently.</p>
<p>In the past, I always believed that newspapers represented public opinion and reported news. Now I know that this is not the case. Some news is produced in order to be reported. And what is called public opinion...... Although the sign is this one, it always seems a bit boring.</p>
<p>I remember that I once saw in a joke book (probably Shi Tianji's "Laugh Well") a story about a fool reading a book, and after looking at it carefully for three days, he realized that the words on the book were printed, not written. At that time, I laughed at it. Unexpectedly, I have been reading newspapers for more than ten years, and only today did I realize that newspapers are also a kind of textbook. So I deeply regret that I laughed too early.</p>
<p>Modern newspapers are clearly divided into two classes: one is those who compile the newspapers, and the other is those who read the newspapers. Those who compile the newspapers are obviously in the position of teachers, while those who read the newspapers are like primary school students who have been assigned, and the newspapers are equivalent to textbooks between teachers and students.</p>
<p>The teacher says: You should respect the teacher. You should do as the teacher teaches you. You must not resist the teacher's orders. So he added a lesson to the textbook. If there are really a few students who do not obey the teacher's orders, or reveal the teacher's shortcomings, then the teacher says: You have violated the school rules and are given a major demerit. So he wrote another lesson in the textbook for you to read. In fact, although the demerit is recorded, the naughty students always refuse to repent and change their ways, but the teacher always thinks it is very appropriate in front of everyone. Otherwise, if the teacher beat the students, how could this lesson be taught? People are so good at thinking for the sake of reading!</p>
<p>Textbooks teach people the knowledge they should learn, such as those who study chemistry, know that two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen equals water. The mission of learning newspapers is to let you know the same. I dare not say that it is because the teacher is not good and I do not understand. I always blame myself for being too stupid and not being able to understand. Therefore, students who read books to death often become bookworms, while smart students will draw inferences from one instance and understand similar things. No matter what the teacher does, the students' knowledge will naturally advance.</p>

<h3 id="e265">*** Road in 1933 <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>The 365 days of 1933 have passed in an unknown way. Taking advantage of the opportunity at the beginning of the new year, if we make a general reckoning of the events we have experienced in the most recent 365 days, it may not be without significance.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Forget the family for the country, forget the private for the public." Based on this ancient训, we should naturally put our national affairs on the first page of the general reckoning table, and should not mention our personal trivial family affairs. Therefore, I have set the title of this article as: "China in the Past Year."</p>
<p>The title is set, but the difficulty arises: Is such a broad topic for a big article suitable for a young guy like me to write?</p>
<p>So I narrowed the title to "Shanghai in the Past Year."</p>
<p>Although this topic is much smaller than the previous one</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>many, however, the various aspects of the ten-mile foreign field cannot be fully described by the [talented people] who roam in it. As for me, who crouches in a corner all day long, to give a longitudinal narrative of the vast Shanghai in the past year, the result can only be a [frog in a well] ridicule. Therefore, I have to find a way to change the title again.</p>
<p>To be honest, since the New Year's Day of 1933 until today, I have not left Shanghai for more than half a month. Except for fifty-two Sundays and occasional holidays, I go to work from my residence to the office every day, leaving early and returning late, living an extremely mechanical life every day. In this way, I am naturally separated from the [outside world]. The only thing I am more familiar with is the XXX Road that I had to pass through from my residence to the office last year. Since XXX Road is a corner of Shanghai society, why not find this corner of society as the subject matter? Therefore, the title of this article was finally finalized: [XXX Road in 1933]</p>
<p>XXX Road is a very long road on the most remote west side of the French Concession. Its length is no less than Jing'an Temple Road in the Public Concession. The difference is that it is not as wide and bustling as Jing'an Temple Road, but it is much quieter than Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>At a certain point on this road, there is a barracks where foreign soldiers are stationed. Next to the barracks, there is a shooting range. Every morning, the shooting range makes a creaking sound, often startling the roosting birds in the woods. And I, too, am quite blessed by this [creaking] sound, so that I will not lose sleep and delay my work. The gate of the barracks is often lined with rickshaws. Each rickshaw puller stares at the gate of the barracks with [expectant] eyes. I think no one who enters or exits there will be missed by their gaze.</p>
<p>"Hallo 'licker'?" When one or a group of tall foreign soldiers in uniform come out of this gate, a group of [coolies] pull their rickshaws and rush over as fast as they can, like snatching food.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people in uniform like to take cars. Sometimes, they like to walk. The [coolies] then look at each other and smile bitterly. Sometimes, people in uniform wave their hands and get into the car, and the coolies feel blessed and run away as fast as they can. Sometimes, people in uniform have excessive anger or joy in their hearts, so they beat the faces or backs of the [coolies] to vent their anger. The coolies? Then they put their sleeves with rags to defend themselves, but their faces always had a smile.</p>
<p>There is a very large square on XXX Road. Football fans will think that this is really suitable for a football field when they see it. However, now, it is piled with stones and overgrown with green grass. From New Year's Day to New Year's Eve, whether it is morning or night, you can see three or two workers or rickshaw pullers squatting there to excrete, often causing modern men and women to avoid it. As time goes by, a lot of excrement accumulates. If a strong wind blows, [toilet paper] will inevitably fly and the fragrance will spread everywhere. From this, we can understand that for the working masses living in the city, even excretion is a serious problem.</p>
<p>Walking on XXX Road, you can see a very magnificent dog mansion. There are probably seventy or eighty dogs there. They have more than a dozen servants to serve them. They eat bread, they wear brocade, and they sleep on thick velvet. Which of us working people has their comfort? However, they can run after electric rabbits in Yiyuan every Saturday, and we cannot. Then, it is only natural that they are given special preferential treatment.</p>
<p>What I know of XXX Road in 1933 is just these. As for the wife's car running over people, the vegetable seller being beaten, etc., these trivial matters do not need to be recorded, and I cannot remember so many. In short, after reading the above fragmented facts, do readers feel that this seems to be a reflection of the entire Chinese society?</p>
<h3 id="e266">The Most Profitable Nation <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>[Everything goes wrong when it comes to China!] A friend who had just returned from abroad said, [Look, people use radio to transmit news and make public academic speeches. But when it comes to China, Chinese people use it to broadcast Tanhuang and ditties. The streets and alleys are full of vulgar Bangzi tunes, which are really noisy!]</p>
<p>This is naturally true. No matter what good things, they go wrong when they come into the hands of Chinese people. Take opium, for example. Foreigners use it to treat diseases, but when it comes to China, smart Chinese people put it on opium pipes to smoke. This is bad. Once you get addicted, unless you are a millionaire, you will end up bankrupting your family.</p>
<p>Some people say: Chinese people only know how to enjoy, not how to create. This is naturally also true. Foreigners make guns and cannons for themselves to play with. But Chinese people want to buy ready-made ones from foreigners. Take airplanes, for example. There are quite a few that are bought from the United States alone. Americans make airplanes and ship them to China one ship after another. After the Chinese people arrive at their homes, they still have to wait for them to assemble everything properly. After the assembly is done, they have to wait for him to sit on it and play with it once for themselves to see before they can take it down.</p>
<p>To give another example, such as cars. There are many Chinese people who take cars. Everyone takes pride in taking a car. People who have a little money want to buy a car. Moreover, in recent years, the government has been promoting the construction of highways, holding aviation road construction conferences, and issuing aviation road lottery tickets. People all over the country are enthusiastically contributing. Naturally, once the highway is built, even people who cannot afford to buy their own cars can take long-distance buses. Anyway, everyone has a car to ride. However, the cars they ride in are all bought ready-made from others. Chinese people simply do not want to make their own cars to ride in.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Chinese people are lucky. Many foreign brats are working hard to create! As long as my father has money, which foreign brat will not come to pay his respects to me!</p>
<p>A German silly boy saw it very clearly, perhaps because he had lived in China for a long time. One day, he said to several Chinese friends: [Yes, yes, what Chinese people want is things that others have made ready-made. The books that students read in Chinese schools are also the results of research by others. Chinese people are the most profitable nation in the world!]</p>

<p>— Cartwheel</p>
<p>It's truly strange. In my dreams, I constantly ask myself, "Is this a dream?" I try all sorts of methods to prove whether it is a dream. I often think I've really gone home, really gotten out—because I have such vivid dreams. Once, I was discussing idealism versus materialism with Lao Sun. As we were walking together in a park, I asked him, "Are we not dreaming?" He said, "If it is a dream, then this is a victory for idealism." Yes, it is indeed a dream.</p>
<p>8th</p>
<p>On the 7th, Wu Mei and three classmates came to visit me. Those three didn't say a single word. What could be done?</p>
<p>Receiving a visitor is both a joyous and a painful thing. Before you can even finish three sentences, the voice urging you to leave cuts off your conversation. You have to beg him to extend the time a little. Although the rules stipulate half an hour, twenty minutes, or ten minutes, the prisoners aren't clear on this. In short, there is a rule; however, the person who truly decides the length of the visit is the warden who escorts us to the meeting—we call every guard "warden." If he is happy, it will be longer; if he is unhappy, it will be shorter. If a prisoner insists on a reasonable extension according to the rules, the prisoner will suffer. One can only plead with furrowed brows, in which case it might be extended by a minute or two, with ten minutes being the longest.</p>
<p>After he interrupts our conversation and we ask him to extend it, we waste some time. Then, when we want to continue our conversation, there's no way to continue, even though we have countless words we want to say. But just as you quietly try to resume the talk, that dog barks again.</p>
<p>Being without visitors is bearable, but having visitors and not being able to talk is the greatest pain for prisoners. So, prisoners are usually calm, but after a visit, they often cry, stare blankly, or become angry.</p>
<p>"Three hundred and ninety-three!"</p>
<p>As soon as I hear this number, I know it's the warden who escorts visitors. I also know right away that it's my sister coming, because no one else comes to visit me.</p>
<p>I had already packed up several cotton clothes, waiting for her to come and take them. At this time, I took them out and walked out. The head guard at the central post stopped me for inspection, suspecting that I might be carrying some small notes out, but I really hadn't cheated. Committing a minor offense—a useless offense—and adding to the lawsuit is really not worth it.</p>
<p>The area in front of the central observation platform is not usually walked by people having visitors, but my sister ignored their interference and came in. I handed her the bag of clothes directly—"Take it to the section for inspection!" the visiting warden told her. I said, "It's already been inspected at the central post!" She didn't take it for inspection later. Normally, you can't directly hand things to the person you want to give them to.</p>
<p>When handing over the clothes, I reached out to shake her hand. She looked at me as if she didn't understand, but immediately understood and squeezed my hand tightly, because this handshake was not a habitual action for her. She also knew this was a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>Indeed, standing together without obstruction in this situation is an extremely precious opportunity. In the visiting area, there are two layers of wooden fences and a layer of barbed wire separating visitors and prisoners, and you have to talk from several feet away. There's really no chance to shake hands. This was the first handshake between my sister and me. There was an opportunity before, and I wasn't separated from her by anything, but I didn't shake her hand. Honestly, I wanted to hug her, but I didn't even shake her hand. Looking back, I feel it was wrong and unreasonable to let go of this opportunity to show some affection—because we were too far apart, and we both desperately needed comfort!</p>
<p>Last time was because Zhao worked in the section, and I was allowed to talk to Zhao, and my sister was there too.</p>
<p>After handing the clothes to my sister, she was walking with me, and a guard, under the guise of checking the clothes, wanted to touch her breast—I can't forget this scene.</p>

<h3 id="e268">Hollywood's Outlook for 1934 <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Xifu</p>
<p>According to general speculation in Hollywood, this year will be an exceptionally hot year. The biggest reason is that the hottest star, Mae West, achieved unprecedented success last year, forcing other stars, who are still recovering their energy, to emulate her; otherwise, it will be difficult to get the audience's money flowing out of their pockets.</p>
<p>However, one thing to note is how "sex" will be portrayed on the screen in 1934. Everyone is hesitant to discuss this issue openly. Why? Because they are afraid that too much discussion will attract the attention of moralistic censors and cause complications. In addition, there are also social reformers. They take social improvement as their mission. Whenever a film has some "immoral" performances, they blush, clench their fists, and speak out. However, it is said that these people have recently become less vocal, partly because public opinion clashes too much with their views, and they are outmatched and change direction accordingly; partly because the film market is so sluggish that it needs hot, stimulating things to revitalize it. Social reformers, for the sake of the overall situation, cannot be too insistent on their own views. Even the film censorship board is quite understanding of the difficulties of the business and refrains from destructive actions. Therefore, works like Mae West's, which previously had little hope of passing, actually passed one by one in 1933. Even so, for the sake of caution, it is of course better to discuss less and produce more.</p>
<p>1934 will not only be hotter than before, but also add some nude scenes. American filmmakers have already been influenced by Russian and German films. Moreover, people are becoming more sophisticated year by year. Things that seemed novel in the past are now commonplace, and new and novel scenes must be sought. Therefore, the works of 1934 will definitely be hotter and more interesting than before, and the expression of human beauty will definitely be bolder.</p>
<p>In 1933, Mae West already set a precedent. In 1934, the following stars are said to be following suit: Pert Kelton, Ginger Rogers. There are also several who are not naturally inclined to romance, but because of their versatility, they are also preparing to change their style in 1934 and join the ranks of romantic stars. They are Helen Hayes, Kay Francis, Claudette Colbert, etc. They already tried their hand last year and unexpectedly reaped rewards.</p>
<p>Audiences are gradually becoming tired of movies for various reasons. Mae West is a hero of Hollywood's revival. Her emergence revitalized the industry. Ginger Rogers followed suit, stirring up a wave of heat in "Professional Sweetheart." Pert Kelton went even further, sacrificing her sexuality in "Bed of Roses" and winning great applause in 1934. Even Diana Wynyard, as gentle as a virgin, cannot help but cast flirtatious glances and exude seductive charm.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e269">Review of "Flames of Youth" <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>丨Tianyi Production · Carlton Screening丨</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Mr. Qiu Qixiang, we must not ignore his existence in Chinese cinema.</p>
<p>From "Lan Gu Ping Zong" and "Pursuit" to the recently released "Struggle," it is not difficult to find traces of his gradual progress in creative techniques. However, the ideology expressed in his works is somewhat elusive. "Lan Gu Ping Zong" or "Pursuit" shows us a tasteless love entanglement. By "Struggle," he seems to be positively showing a new tendency. Although it still preaches the doctrine of loyalty and forbearance, it does depict the suffering of farmers in the countryside. This makes us look forward to the bright future of Chinese cinema. However, people's minds are indeed mysteriously elusive!</p>
<p>(2) "Flames of Youth" is also written and directed by the author, which shows his complete control from the selection of material to the techniques of expression.</p>
<p>The characters in "Flames of Youth" are all lords, ladies, young ladies, and young masters in the military. Among these people, the author has created a Romanlism romance.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not ignore that the author has exposed the ugliness of officialdom, the nepotism among military officers, the private bestowal of ranks and titles. These all make us believe that this is a bold style. However, the theme of the story is not here; on the contrary, the sole purpose is the conclusion of the sacredness of love. Therefore, we cannot obtain considerable satisfaction from "Flames of Youth," especially when this love game has already been rejected by audiences in theaters.</p>
<p>Opposition to marriages arranged by parents and matchmakers seems to be a thing of the past. No matter why Liu Duban wants to marry his daughter to the brigade commander, no matter why Liu Duban wants to promote the brigade commander to division commander simply because he dotes on his daughter, and no matter that the beautiful daughter marries an ugly husband, we see that the author deeply sympathizes with and pities her, but the author has no way to make her escape her husband's embrace. Even Meng Xilian won't give her "a part of love," so she can only "sacrifice for love," ending her own life with a pistol and dying in the arms of her lover. Death is the explosion of the flames of youth, and the so-called pure love receives the author's great praise!</p>
<p>(4) I remember that in answering an interviewer's questions, Mr. Qiu once said that he was very saddened by the Americanization of Chinese film works. But until now, until this "Flames of Youth," Mr. Qiu's scripts and performances are all imitations of American films. Therefore, American films have deeply planted their roots in China, and here is another example.</p>
<p>(5) As mentioned above, the director's composition of the screen is indeed very pure and hot in some places. The smoothness of the editing and the appropriateness of the scenery are all strengths. However, the excessive number of unnecessary subtitles is a major flaw.</p>
<p>The most unsatisfactory aspect is the melodramatic acting of some actors, and the inappropriate insertion of gags, which is the director's responsibility. However, the most commendable aspect is the beauty of the scenery. Except for some Fade locations that are not very clear, the matching of lights is indeed worthy of praise!</p>
<h3 id="e270">Salt Tide Review <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Just like rice and even air, salt is something that almost everyone needs every day. On the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East Sea, there are millions, even tens of millions, of people who depend on it for survival; in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, there are tens of millions, even hundreds of millions, of people who value it more than rice because it is difficult to obtain. But those who cannot obtain salt are indeed struggling to make a living due to other reasons, while those who make salt by hand are struggling to make a living even more, even to the point of starving and freezing to death. Thus, this boundless salt tide roared!</p>
<p>The sea is nature's inexhaustible treasure, but the salt produced must be exploited by salt merchants. The public wasteland where salt-burning bushes grow is formed by the rising of the sea, but after boundary markers are erected, it becomes the private property of powerful people. Burning salt without a license is "private burning," and you will be taken to the official; selling to salt peddlers who offer slightly higher prices instead of selling to salt merchants is "private peddling," and you will be taken to the official. When there is no rice and your mother is sick, five yuan worth of salt brine can only buy four, and thus the boundless salt tide roared!</p>
<p>Relying on one's special position and superior economy, setting traps to change the will of young girls and taking away other people's lovers—thus the boundless salt tide roared!</p>
<p>"The revolution is about to begin,</p>
<p>The people have risen..." (Song of the Iron Current)</p>
<p>In the boundless, roaring "Salt Tide," we hear such songs! Whether it is the warlord era of 1925, the present of 1934, or even the future after 1934, if the above-mentioned situation exists, this boundless "Salt Tide" will roar no matter what. "Local tyrants and evil gentry will eventually be overthrown" (general meaning of the subtitles). Naturally, it is the power of the masses themselves that overthrows them, not any other irrelevant "ism." In "Salt Tide," we see this clearly.</p>
<p>Naturally, the masses in "Salt Tide" are not heroes arbitrarily created by the writer. It seems that A'feng (played by Hu Die) is a young girl who can be tempted by the material possessions of Mr. Hu (played by Sun Min). She wants to go to Shanghai with Mr. Hu, but when she learns that Mr. Hu has enclosed the common salt bush land of their entire village, she becomes the most vehement resister. This is her class consciousness. Everyone wants to live better, but when they realize that their group is about to starve to death or encounter a major hardship, they will definitely unite with their group. The deception of the peasants-turned-workers in the film "Gold Mountain" finally awakens at the start of a great struggle; although salt workers are a little different from ordinary farmers, they "have land and houses" (Zhang Desan's words in the play) and are the same as ordinary farmers. Then, under this condition, A'feng's character and consciousness, as expressed in "Salt Tide," are absolutely correct. I remember a miner in "Destruction" saying: "No matter who it is, if you dig deeper and deeper, there will always be a farmer in their soul." (general meaning) "Because the city is in the embrace of the countryside, and the miners are intertwined with the farmers," let alone the daughter of a salt worker? As for Chen Bingsheng's (played by Wang Zhengxin) firmer stance, it is also inevitable. Don't you see his conditions of "private peddling" and "youth"? The future world is created by youth!</p>

<p>— Cang Bo</p>
<p>"Youth": What a lovely, beautiful word. "Flame" is also such an exciting, passionate thing, let alone this "Flame" is the "Flame of Youth"? Ah! This flame is too passionate.</p>
<p>Every man and woman in the world, who doesn't want to keep his or her youth forever, who isn't burning with this flame of youth, whether male or female, ugly or beautiful, who isn't intoxicated by this lovely flame, even though this flame may sometimes scorch your skin, or even burn your heart? But they still move forward bravely and rush headlong into this lovely flame, some returning in triumph, others retreating with serious injuries. However, facts tell us: this youth is so easy to pass away, this flame is so easy to extinguish.</p>
<p>Tianyi's new film "Flames of Youth" is premiering at Carlton. I don't need to advertise it here regarding how superb the director is and how realistic the expressions are, but at least it will give every pursuer of the flame of youth a little inspiration. Happy friends, please bring your loved ones here and put the flame of youth into your hearts, because there is poetry here, there are paintings here, it can intoxicate your soul, it can beautify your life!</p>

<p>— Hui Lan</p>
<p>Zhi Chao seemed to have something to say, but he stammered and hesitated. Finally, he said, "I owe you so much for saving me this time, and I don't have much to repay you. I'm graduating from military academy this year, and my family has a little property. May I ask you to betroth Xiaofen to me?"</p>
<p>Gui Sheng thought for a while and suddenly said, "Your injury has healed, and this place is very simple and slow. Please be on your way tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Zhi Chao was unexpectedly disappointed. Looking inside, Xiaofen walked step by step to Gui Sheng's side, looking at the expressions on their faces, then slowly lowered her head. From disappointment to pain, Xiaofen's tears were almost about to fall. Zhi Chao looked at this situation and helplessly lowered his head and walked out of the door. Gui Sheng saw Zhi Chao lingering outside the door, turned his head and said softly to Xiaofen, "Don't take it seriously. This is just a temporary whim of the rich. Forcing a marriage will definitely not end well in the future." The moonlight was so cold, Zhi Chao wandered back and forth, and Xiaofen slowly approached him, silently unable to speak. Zhi Chao stroked Xiaofen's shoulder and sat on the stone bench. Xiaofen looked at him with tears in her eyes, again and again. Zhi Chao seemed to have thought of something, leaned close to her ear, and whispered. Xiaofen shook her head firmly in surprise. Zhi Chao held her hand tightly and whispered again.</p>
<p>"Then what about Dad alone?" she asked. Zhi Chao knew she had been swayed, so he told her his remedy. Xiaofen finally nodded shyly in agreement. The two looked at each other affectionately.</p>
<p>The moonlight shone in from the window. Gui Sheng was already fast asleep. Zhi Chao and Xiaofen were packing their luggage, secretly pushing open the door and going out. The shadows of the two quickly disappeared on the ground. The alarm clock rang, and Gui Sheng woke up from his dream. Seeing the door wide open, he knew something was wrong. He quickly turned back inside, but Xiaofen was nowhere to be found. He ran out, but the train had already passed through the gate. Zhi Chao and Xiaofen in the second-class carriage made him angry, and two tears flowed from his old eyes.</p>
<p>The transformation started from the bottom. Xiaofen's feet had changed from cloth shoes to embroidered shoes, and then from embroidered shoes to high heels. Naturally, her clothes had changed from short jackets to cheongsams, and her hair had naturally been cut.</p>
<p>A orderly came in and handed over a calling card. Zhi Chao looked at the calling card and happily walked to Xiaofen. "This is my fellow villager Yue Xue, and also my current direct superior, Chief of Staff Wang Zhen'an. Come out and meet him in a while!"</p>
<p>At this time, Xiaofen's hometown was experiencing a flood in the late autumn season! Everything was flooded. Gui Sheng was mixed among the disaster victims, scrambling to climb onto the train to escape for his life.</p>
<p>At this time, Xiaofen was not the same as before. Slender eyebrows, curly hair, she could actually follow Wang Zhen'an and Li Zhi Chao into the bustling, intoxicating dance hall. Zhang Manlin, a social star, was a queen who dominated men. She stood up happily, ordered a group of boyfriends, everyone to have a drink, suddenly saw Zhen'an, left all her boyfriends, walked over, greeted Zhen'an very affectionately, unceremoniously pulled out a chair, sat next to Zhen'an, turned to look at Zhi Chao, and signaled Zhen'an to introduce him to her.
