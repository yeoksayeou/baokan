<p>（華盛頓）倫敦方面雖稱、日本宣言事件已告一段落、然今日國務總理赫爾表示、美國不抱此見解、當新聞記者提出倫敦方面傳來電訊、稱英國認廣田外相解釋爲滿意、赫爾僅答稱、『關於此點、余未與英國相商』、此或爲英美兩國對於日本四月十七日發表之宣言、不能採取共同行動之初次表示、惟昨日國務院官員與英國駐美大使林德賽談話、盛傳英美兩國之意見、雖未能盡同、然亦大體相似、赫爾又稱、國務院將詳細研究日本遠東新政策之原文、然後决定覆文、或其他行動、赫爾復明言政府無論如何並不以此事已告結束、赫爾在結語中表示彼現有數點須經詳細研究後始能决定、美國所要求之解釋是否滿意、赫爾對於誰能决定何種對華借欵或援助爲有礙遠東之和平一問題、尤感注意、赫爾表示關於此點、易使各國發生異見云、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）東京傳來消息、謂日本廣田外相以說帖送交英美兩國大使、聲明日本尊重中國領土完整及門户開放政策之意向、此間聞訊頗感良好印象、國務卿赫爾對於此事目前不願發表宣言、僅謂得到種種必要文件後、當對遠東時局作深刻之研究、至於與英國共同行動一層、是否曾經討論、則渠未有所聞云云、日本大使齋籐聲稱、廣田外相遞交英美大使之說帖、其正式副本渠尚未接得云云、據今晨倫敦消息、英國對於日本外相提出之解釋、似已表示滿意、而認此事爲已『結束』云、羅斯福總統現仍與赫爾國務卿時時接洽、以研究日本宣言在遠東釀生之新局面、此項研究、現在尚未蕆事、故美國究採何種態度、尚不發表、今後時局之發展、當視具體事實如何爲斷、原則問題、其次焉者也、（二十八日哈瓦斯社電）　　（華盛頓）關於日本對華政策宣言、國務卿赫爾在研究日本正式公文以前、不願發表任何宣言、且不願承認已收到日本正式公文、實則本星期中、美國駐東京大使格魯接得此項公文、業已電達國務院矣、又據半官式方面消息、日本駐美大使齋籐最近發表宣言、修改日本外務省聲明之後、時局大見緩和、日本及英國且似以爲此事業已結束、然華盛頓方面、則决不認爲已告結束云、（二十八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）據星期快報載稱、明日外相西門將在下院聲明日本已宣布不欲干涉其他各國在華之權益及日本不欲取違反九國公約之任何立塲云、（廿九日路透電）　　（倫敦）西門外相將於昨星期一蒞下院報告中國情勢、並將英駐日大使林德萊與廣田外相及廣田與美大使葛羅間談話之電文、提交下院、復次、外相將重行斷言英國遵守九國公約、以使日本不致憂慮、英國未來政府卽有任何改變、英政府之政策、斷不因其他國家方面之宣言而受影響、廣田外相未曾爭論此種見解、現在衆信再進一步備忘錄之交換、殊非必要云、（廿八日字林報電）</p>

<p>（東京）駐華公使有吉、昨日午後一時四十分晤廣田外相、會談約兩小時、廣田外相則說明對華外交方針及其恊和外交之精神、並希望更增加努力、略謂現在已非靜觀主義之時期、實已達到積極解决中日懸案之地步、雙方意見趨於一致、其晤談之内容大致如左、</p>
<p>（一）以樹立鄰邦各國之親善關係爲主旨、勤勞半載、竟使中國覺悟其排日運動之非、對於他國不合理之援助、亦使之覺其不足以貢獻中國及維持東亞之和平、今則在精神上已釀成中日提携之濃厚色彩矣、</p>
<p>（二）中日兩國以唇齒輔車之關係、故爲維持東亞和平起見、除中日直接交涉以外、實無他途、</p>
<p>（三）最初當設法解决華北之通車通郵及稅關等之懸案、其次則整理貿易關係、以上兩件均宜漸次進行、</p>
<p>（四）爲彼此增進信用計、由政治經濟上實行接近、同時交換文化、如對華文化事業部之積極活動、亦屬有效之措置、</p>
<p>（五）凡屬經濟與文化上之實質問題、務須使之深切了解、藉作親善之基礎、然後努力解决政治之問題、於是中日問題可改善、東亞和平亦可因之確立、而成爲確保世界和平之一大支柱矣云云、（二十九日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）廣田日外相廣田以歸國之有吉駐華公使之報告及重要進言爲基礎、與陸海軍其他各關係方面恊議之上、令有吉公使於三週後、携關於對華新政策之訓令歸任、觀最近中國之對日態度、下列各點業已明白、卽（一）華北懸案漸次移於分别解决之實際的態度、（一）對日本在東亞有特殊責任之根本主張、觀於前日中國政府對於日本對華政策聲明之聲明、實際的已明白諒解、（一）中國所警戒之最重要點、在於憂慮日本進行侵略中國領土或獨占中國市塲等政策、因此廣田外相擬乘此機會、懇切說明對華政策之眞意、使中國信賴日本能恊力圓滿解决在東亞之共同問題及共通利益、確信中國必能諒解、故廣田外相之新對華政策、必能漸次實現、中日關係必能復歸常道、而與東亞全局之前途以光明云、（二十九日電通電）</p>

<p>（紐約）連絡國聯與中國之大員拉西曼博士、今日接見新聞記者、拒絕批評日内瓦與倫敦傅稱日本攻擊拉氏、認拉氏從事政治活動、因此拉氏不欲重返中國云、拉氏宣稱、『余所能相告者、卽余尚未接日内瓦方面之通告、以决定余是否依照原定計畫於下星期重返中國、余之表示僅此而已』、據日内瓦消息、外交界以爲拉氏在七月中告滿其一年之任期後、或將不再續任該項要職、外交家表示拉氏之使命、純限於技術方面、但未表示傅稱中之日本責言、予以若何之嚴重考慮（二十八日國民電）</p>

<p>(華盛頓)蘇俄駐美大使脫羅稚諾沃斯基在某處演講、謂有若干國家願控制他國、或征服之、而不願與之合作、脫氏隨述一俄國有趣之寓言、謂貓在廚中竊雞、爲庖丁所見、庖丁訓斥之、娓娓若動聽者、而竊食之貓從容食雞、毫不爲動、國際政治正可以此喻之、目下問題卽在貓之不聽敎訓、繼續竊食時、則將何以處之、易言之、卽國際上制裁問題是　也、據脫羅雅諾沃斯基所見、吾人對于超國際法庭、未免過存奢望、此由國聯會及海牙國際法庭之經騐、可以知之、國際上各種問題之解、决、繫於各國本身、而不繫於超國際之力量、惟國際上訂立極明確之條約合法簽字、始能使國際關係得到可以容納之基礎、而國際法亦卽有其可靠之根據矣、（廿九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）英國觀察報今日又評論日本所發對於中國事件不許他國染指之聲明、謂西方諸國政府漸知東京聲明、與日本向有之政策背道而馳、日人解釋之詞、縱尚友好、但缺少擔保實質、質言之、日本旣不顧簽定九國公約之其他七國、而要求獨有支配四萬萬中國人民之勢力、且已發欲與英美海軍平等之言論、不僅此也、證諸日本某報、日本並欲對於新加坡根據地提出抗議、以爲危及日本、此種狂妄舉動、乃日本不智之證、其立卽結果、已爲羅斯福總統海車軍建造之發動、而倫敦人士亦確信東京所公佈文告與發表言論之精神、現引起九國公約之問題、蓋以日本所要求單獨行動、及自負責任以保。持遠東和平與秩序一節、揆諸九國公約之條文、實相抵觸也、就借欵與軍械言、倫敦人士固承認在或發生爭論的步驟採行以前、日本亦有就商之權、與其他七國初無稍異、但英政府决不能承認日本『特殊地位』之要求、如各以其在華特殊權益爲言、則有最堅强之要求理由者、莫如英國、蓋中國經濟與金融生活所賴以成立者、大都爲英人資金也云、（二十九日路透電）</p>

<p>（南京）立法委員劉盥訓被推爲外交問題建議案審查委員、據說、近來外交應付、極處困難、治本莫急於培養國力、治標則應省度國際形勢、促起九國公約簽字國共同履行責任、對於逾越範圍之日本、予以制裁、若效法勾踐、而日本非當年之夫差、報仇雪恥、非一蹴可幾、權衡輕重、酌情度勢、今日之中國、乃處於國際間之中國、國際有公約、雖其效力有待於證明、但吾人决不能以其效力未見從而失望、九國公約簽字於華盛頓一九二二年二月六日、簽字之際、各國之熱烈、不以條文僅屬九條而减其信仰、美國爲發起國家、篤信和平、該項公約、對於國之主權完整之保障、第一條卽規定甚明、日本亦爲簽字國、今公然違反之、中國卽應昭告各國、共起盡保障神聖條約之責任、否則此例一開、尚何國際條約信用之可言、美政府及簽字國、當必已考慮及此、中國發奮自强、因爲必要、但簽字國維護條約、亦有其應盡之義務、要之九國公約之提出、必爲日本之當頭棒也、（二十九日專電）</p>

<p>日本軍部。自陸相林銑十郎復職後。對外益傾向於强硬政策。對内則努力造成非常時期之緊張空氣。雖國内障碍叢生。危機日積。右其着力於侵略政策之展開。乃愈加甚。最近日報載軍部重要負責人員以迄中下級將校。均將有巨大之更動。其趨勢則在澈底造成主戰强硬派荒木系與凖荒木系之清一色局面是也。此種趨勢所影響於日本國内者。將使㢠光返照之議會立憲政治。從此告終。炙手可熱之財閥。匪特不能與軍閥相抗衡。且將降而爲軍閥之　犬。其所影響於遠東和平者。將使太平洋均勢感受空前之威脅。而獨占中國之舉。亦將因之而更形急進。吾人就現有事實。細加認識。當知日本軍部調動具有多數特科部隊之名古屋第三師團於中東路沿線。又調京都第十六師團於熱河方面。必非偶然的調防性質。而皆含有極重大之國際意義。其於四月十七日日外務省所發表之非正式聲明。殆尤有密切連帶之關係。吾人愼勿爲一時之外交烟幕所蒙蔽也。不寗惟是。日本近來盛倡英美日海軍平等之說。欲以海軍比率與英美交換其他權利。交換不成。或將獨行其是。破毁太平洋均勢之局。以期增高其控制東亞之覇權。此又推測得之者也。是以太平洋之險惡風雲。初未稍减。而日美戰爭與日蘇戰爭之說。亦依然蕩漾於世人之耳鼓。然據當前形勢以測將來。日美立國政策之矛盾固多。而經濟關係。尚可調和。且太平洋廣　五千餘浬。長途遠征。以當强。敵任何一方。皆難必勝。僅此二點。已足决定日美戰爭。在短時期。内尚不致實現。</p>
<p>至於日蘇關係。則與日美逈異蓋日蘇在北滿利害之衝突。日見尖銳。絕少緩和之餘地。縱令中東鐵道買賣成功。北海漁業暫告解决。而兩國根本利害。依然相左。卽能轉圜於一時。絕難調和於永久。今兩國皆在調動重兵。增加武力。一若戰爭危機。間不容髮也者。實則蘇聯現正亟亟從事於第二五年計劃之實施。决不肯輕易對外挑釁。以自損其國力。日本包藏侵略人國之野心。豈来欲擇肥而噬。然以布置未妥。徒作過大之犧牲。求不可必得之欲望。當亦有所顧忌。蓋以今日日本之兵力。佔領西比利亞。或不甚難。但蘇聯亦必不肯就此乞和。勢必憑其强大之陸空軍爲前鋒。豐富之資源爲後盾。與日本爭最後之勝利。則亦爲日本所不敢貿然一拚者。是以日蘇戰爭。在短時期亦未必遂至爆發。然此非謂日俄戰禍可以倖免。也將來挑戰開始。當爲日而不爲俄。一待日本在華北右置妥貼之日。殆卽第二次日俄大戰蒞臨之時。試觀日軍近來在熱河邊境屯駐兩個師團重兵。又派遣幹部四出偵察。名爲遊歷。實則觀測地形。且晝夜趕築熱河鐵道。其　意何在。任何人皆知其在窺我華。窺華北京卽以對付蘇聯。然則彼亟亟於整軍備武。與我有莫大之關係。可不急起直追。預籌應付之方哉。</p>

然現不出如何壯烈的。這不是說，工人寗可當家奴，不願做其他民族的奴隸。這祗是某一時期勞資鬥爭的狀態。可惜力言君未能看出，或别有作用的曲解。你雖然不能說出它的錯誤，郤能用目前的事實去對照，這是非常正確的方法。關於這一項，我也就不多費辭了。　　你對於該雜誌二二一頁那篇文字的末一段的『總括』，表示了反對的意見，也完全是對的。其實，那篇文章整個結論是錯誤的。關於這篇文字恰巧我們有位細心的讀者早已向我們指出了。現在且節錄幾句如次，以釋你的疑念。　　『就整個結論說，第四，第五等都是錯誤的。···第五，作者說，『經濟不景氣，失業恐慌，日本帝國主義的蹂躝淞滬，更是工人運動致命的打擊一，這完全是曲解事實。我們只聞經濟不景氣下各國工潮風湧，郤未曾聽過『不景氣』反可使工潮低落的妙論。日本帝國主義的蹂躝淞滬，上海的工人不是擊起而與日帝國主義作戰麽？打擊了什麽？打擊工人運動的是什麽？作者故意將它掩蔽，很巧妙的把工運的困難移到不獨不會打擊工運且有助長工運的外力去，眞是令人有點莫明其妙了·』　　『從以上的錯誤的分拆，於是得到（工運不是漸次消沉而且走上了澈底破產的道路。）這唯無疑問的。作者故意與嘆道··（用什麽法子加以挽救呢？），好像眞的在替工人關心似的。其實不然，這結論是將與作者的初衷相反的，它結果反會消滅勞動者之情緒，消滅整個的工人運動，而不是代勞動者說話的呀！）　　我們對於某君這段意見是大致同意的。你讀後或者不無些許裨益罷！最後，我們對於你要了解『勞働問題的動因』等，覺得你還有做點論理研究的必要。關於這一方面的研究，說來話長，如果你對於社會科學已有了初步基礎知識時，你可以專門讀關於勞働問題的書。你不僅要讀正確的理論，與工人運動史實，你還是注意目前正在流行於美國，德國等處的資本家工會運動。他們這種行動，你不要認爲卑賤，不値你一顧，你如果眞是一個客觀的研究者，你應平心靜氣的去研究，這才是工運最實踐的研究。輪船進口預告　　（四月）　　定生　三十日津烟來怡和武昌　　三十日長江來太古寳和　三十日長江來怡和芝沙力　三十日香港來　華格蘭脫　三十日香港來美郵江大　三十日長江來招商寗紹　三十日長江來寗紹　　（五月）廣東　一日港汕來太古富陞　一日靑島來怡和芝加令　一日大連來　　麥鑫閱　一日日本來美郵江華　一日長江來招商三北　一日長江來三北武穴　二日長江來太古通州　二日津烟來太古聯和　二日長江來怡和海上　二日靑島來招商普安　二日靑島來招商重慶　三日港厦來太古四川　三日洪汕來太古新寗　三日靑島來太古德安　三日粤港來太古湘潭　三日長江來太古湖北　三日牛連來太古甘州　三日津烟來太古隆和　三日長江來怡和源生　三日粤港來怡古吳淞　四日長江來太和和生　四日靑島來怡和捷陞　四日福州來怡和早生　四日津烟來怡和達耳得娘四日香港來法郵輪船出口報告　　波班新北京三十日　太古新寗紹三十日　寗紹鴻興　三十日　逵興寗興　一日　三北新江天　一日招商　　　　長江班江安　三十日　招商大迎　三十日　太古吉和　三十日　怡和華平　三十日　寗紹長沙　一日　太古德和　一日　怡和新寗興　一日　三北武昌　二日　太古寳和　二日宜昌　怡和江　　二日　招商寗紹　二日　寗紹　陽　三日　太古聯和　三日　怡和江華　三日　招商武穴　四日宜昌　太古隆和　四日　怡和吳淞　五日　太古　　北洋班順天　三十日威烟津太古綏陽　三十日靑島　太古澤生　一日靑島　怡和新銘　二日威烟津招商通州　四日威烟津太古四川　四日靑島　太古源生　四日靑島　怡和　生　五日烟津　怡和德安　五日連牛　太古　　南華班新疆　三十日汕港粤太古富陞　一日汕港粤怡和濟南　一日厦港粤太古廣東　三日汕港粤太古新寗　四日汕港粤太古海上　四日汕港粤招商和生　四日汕港粤怡和　　温州班廣濟　一日　招商海晏　五日　招商　　福州班萬象　一日　三北益利　四日　聯安　　瑞安陽平班新　平　四日瑞平沙滬興瑞平　八日禁瑞平滬與　　通揚班志大　三十日　大通大慶　三十日　大達正大　一日　大通大　　一日　大達隆大　二日　大通大通　二日　大逹鴻大　三日　大通　　温古班舟山　三十日定　　聯安穿山　二日穿石台聯安大華　三日定　温聯安達興　四日定石海聯安古州　五日定石台聯安　　香港小宫宋班　　麥金關　二日　美郵俄羅斯　七日　昌　林肯　八日　人來　　歐洲郵船班　　奈弟位　一日倫敦大英　耳得　　日是　馬　法郵　布　　七日　　美　時盤　　　十日　　　　　　脫凡　十一日　　　　意郵　　洋郵船班格　　　一日西雅　美郵加拿大　七日温哥武昌　批亞斯　　二日　金山大　太平洋　廿三日紐約天祥　　　　　世界班　　亞　担　　八日　大來春秋御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯（四）鐵路官員　　其中有一輛車是我們可以不必注意的，因爲它實在是毫無可以値得我們注意的東西。那就是一輛專供各個工役堆放衣箱，網籃，舖陳等等雜貨的車子。但是這車上，却老是有人在忙亂着，因爲每當這些工役們發現自已所穿的宫袍已滿沾了烟煤油垢的時候，他們便到這輛車上來更換新的。担是我可不知道他們是否可以隨時來更換，還是必須在指定的時間内更换。我曾經在那車上穿過好幾次却並不見有人在換衣服，也没有人來阻擋我。雖然我是已經得到了太后的特許，儘可隨意行走，然而我想他們一定也有一種秘密的暗號，待我走到那裏的時候，他們便特地違讓，待我走過之後，再開始更換他們的衣服。　　在這輛工役雜貨車之後，另有一輛車，裝着一羣很特别的人物，那便是京奉鐵路上的一班官員。關於他們，倒很有些文章可寫。也許是因爲他們太庸碌得可笑的緣故，或者是因爲他們足以代表滿清官塲的腐敗的緣故。　　雖然他們的名義是『鐵路官員』，其實他們根本不能辦什麽官事。分們對於京奉鐵路，除掉坐享厚利之外，便不能有别的作用了。這一次，他們之所以隨駕同行者，一半固然是因爲太后誤認他們對於鐵路有特别的學識，想要他們來照管行車，保護安全的關係，可是還有一半的原因，乃是他們自已想借這個機會，再弄些額外的進益。所以說在這一列御用火車上，他們是最特别的一羣！（二二）書潘老蘭  清癯　　潘老蘭作古，又少詞人矣。猶憶老蘭三十年前，操香港循環日報筆政，名著海内外，時吳趼人以我佛山人，蜚聲藝壇，而老蘭亦以獨立山人，與之頡頑。今人僅知其署百花村長，羅浮道士『水晶道士』，而不知飛聲固又有山人名號也。至翦松閣姬人月子，猶爲晚年明月之傍，一星光曜耳。若其德配，飛素閣主，姓梁，名靄，字偑瓊，南海人，四十年前，已賦悼亡。其遺詩，如皐冒廣生序之，謂『所作幽曲織峭，感人肺腑』，蓋雖苦吟雅宗之士，或未能過，而老蘭張之，亦一詞林彤管之光也。　　老蘭著述等身，海内知之，可無贅言。昔邱僊根有云··『老蘭編詩似朱十，曠代相感唯牧之，何曾愛護到街卒，祗許風流傳畫師。四海共推敢論事，千秋詎信空稱詩，才人薄倖不自諱，何不併寫江南枝』。注謂紅豆而實爲『江湖載酒圖』作也。時老蘭在粤，右泉畫師潑墨於花田珠海間，名士聯吟，稱極盛已。　　茲聞姚君虞琴，搜其遣　，以丁敬禮自任，則老蘭身後，不寂寞矣。其門人擬上私謚爲靜逸先生，則老蘭自戊戍後，不應經濟特科者再，其不求聞達，退隱滬濱，則福履理路之兩椽老屋，筆毛墨瀋，卽蒐裘終老之鄉，雖謂狐死正邱首可也。人謂老蘭三子，父死不顧，或以電告，而僅得『棄職來滬。兩餐無著』　之噫！老蘭之生平，亦可想矣。過眼風華  烟橋　　蘇州城南多隙地，近來那些落伍政潦，失意軍人大腹賈，世家子，都愛着蘇州處境幽靜，來買宅退休，有的闢地作新，總是周匝種些花木，這幾天春暖如酥，風和欲醉，在院子裏的碧桃紅杏，都關不住了。我們從迤邐着的女牆外經過，見到一簇春容，眞有些俳徊不忍遽去的情况，覺得比叩門而入，作劉楨平視，更有味些。　　前天我到吳江去，在盤門外瞥見靑陽地的櫻花，正爛然如錦，蔚然如雲。收回日本租界，鬧得震天價響，不知道何時可以如願以債，我想將來當眞物歸原主，這兩行櫻花，還是要保存他，使我們的子子孫孫，永遠記着，這地方曾經有木屐兒點汚過。　　天賜莊只是長綠樹種得多，所以只感到肅穆，没有活潑潑的趣味。到了景海女學的牆外，纔有幾種春花抬頭。東吳大學也不多見，可是從孫堂遙望到葛堂林堂之問，一座茅亭的後面，幾株淺絳的桃花，從一堆深碧的柏樹上湧起來，好似許多穿着靑布旗袍的小姑娘在微笑，倒是怪有味的。東北四連長  張恨水第二十八回　巧合共觀塲痴情拾帕　殷勤兩問疾誤會投書　　　他因笑道··旣是那麽着；我來請老太爺罷。趙翁笑道··我們到了戲館子再說，誰請都算不了什麽？請！說着，他用手扶着積之，請在前面走。積之本來要客氣一下，無如趙翁後面，就是江氏母女，自已虚着心，總怕致干未便。因之點了兩點頭，也就在前面走着了。他雖這樣的心虚，可是江氏和趙翁一樣·態度很大方，在後面跟着，就笑問道··甘二爺，什麽時候回來過年的？積之這才想起趙翁也問了　這名話的，便道··我對於過年這件事，已經看得十分淡薄，况且時局這樣不好，那有那分心事。只是家兄有些家事要和我談談，我直到前日，才趕回來的。趙翁笑道··現在靑年人倒都有愛國心，只憑這一點，也許中國亡不了。積之笑道··要說到愛國，我可慚愧，我對於愛國兩字，是芝蔴大的事，也没有作過一面。那能比令郎趙連長眞正的抗了槍桿出去？趙翁道··他是當兵的，那又當别論了。我怎麽說　現在靑年愛國呢？當八國聯軍進北京城的時候，我也還是個靑年啦。要說到亡國，那也就差不離了吧？你猜怎麽着？洋兵全都進城了，老百姓還不知道怎麽回事。現在總算進步一點，山海關砲響了，大家也就曉得發愁啦。積之笑道··老太爺，有您這一段批評，靑年人像我這樣的更應當羞死。趙翁倒不解所謂，正想問個所以然。早有一陣鑼鼓響送入耳朶，原來是已經走到戲館子邊下了。他已經來不及談話，便向前去找座。這裏也是適用舊戲館子規矩，是由看客入戲館子去自已去找座的。（三七三）新門羅主義！中華堂外部言宣反对反对反对　論張大千畫  孤鸞　　百花釀作酒一　，百藥鍊成丹一丸，五味入口取其甘，五色入目取其鮮；五聲入耳取其和，惟貌不獨取其妍···言之有物餅中饀，裁之或幅機中練；視之無跡水中鹽，出之則飛匣中劍。』此樊山老人論詩長句也。學問藝術之事，源遠則流長，積厚則施遠，是固不獨於詩爲然。故吾讀張大千之畫，覺其不可及者，卽在博覽深思，牢籠萬象，逈非拘曲下士，守一先生之說，自封故步，所得比擬。大千曩以善畫石濤八大有聲，然其畫實不拘拘二家，凡唐宋以降，古人劇蹟，大千苟力之所及，無不兼收並蓄；以求會通。故於黄山諸家取其詭，新安諸家取其雅，吳門取其秀；華亭取其馴；取海岳之厚，取鷗波之高；取方壼房由濕筆，取　阿垢道人渴筆；取大風之風神，取衣白之氣宇；取南田若仙，取老蓮若俠；取院體之周詳，取寫意之疎簡；取元明，取唐宋，可謂取之不盡，用之不竭矣。而意若以爲未足，則大千又嘗受筆法於曾農　清道人、通古今書學之源流。故知毛鼎散盤之博大，五嶽之拱也；楚鍾齊鎛之紆徐，三江之帶也；知篆之垂爲崖，公之達爲嶺；隷之蓄爲淵，楷之飭爲岫；北碑之右折若斧劈，南碑之；圓轉爲解索；金錯刀用之描，撥鐙用之麬；鈎勒之勁若折釵股，點染之凝若屋漏痕；於是而古人『石如飛白木如　』之說，渺乎小矣。然而古人所矜，宗派法度，無不出於自然。知古人而不知自然，則古人以吾爲轅駒。然，則吾以古人爲魚筌。故大千復好游，家本西蜀，巫山最奇，江水發源，浪游入海，南畫楚粤，北極遼瀋，東至日本，登高麗，金剛山，　黄山，寢饋不去。恍然峨嵋三峽之險峻，北宗所出，吳楚諸山之揖讓，南宗以與。而黄山之窮態極妍，漸江得其情，清湘得其變，翟山南坪模其形，一松一木，大被後人。於是心摹乎追，游稿屢易，戞戞乎樊山所謂　酒熟丸丹轉矣。則言其過程之悠遠，致力之艱苦，取材之精宏如此，是詎能一蹴而幾者哉。吾知大千深，故於其畫展，不能無的論列，不敢避於阿私。然綜合大體，數其流變，務使觀者知其酸鹹之不同，而一篇一幅之美，可置勿論。卽其伯氏病後作風之丕變。與門弟子之好學不倦，皆當别爲文張之，亦不箸於　云、零聞  有基　　據羅馬報章的記載，說有三個中國兒童，快入法西斯蒂黨了。那三個兒童是隆鍾的兩個兒子和一個小女兒。姓鍾的是中國駐羅馬公使館的屬員。他請求允他的子女加入法西斯蒂黨的兒童組，當被允准了。據蘭克腦電稱，在附近貝娜的沙那Ｓａｒｎａｌｈ地方，决將建造一所國際佛敎大學

<p>經濟專刊每逢星期一日出版第十七期美棉借欵减少數額之原因  迪先　　自民國十九年以降，國内棉產供給不足之呼聲日盛，爲全國最大工業之紗廠，且以棉貴紗賤而日趨衰落，棉荒之象，可謂達於極點，因此宋子文氏於去歲出席世界經濟會議，便道訪晤羅斯福時，而有向美貸欵購棉之舉，乃消息傳來，國内與論，幾於一致反對，在經濟學上以爲貸欵之害多利少，固不待言，甚且有人以爲此項棉花，是否爲國内所需要，亦復引爲疑問，去歲下半年國内各種刋物，討論棉麥貸欵之論文中，屢屢見之，彼時棉貴紗賤之情勢，猶日趨於嚴重，故有人以爲此種言論，乃不切事理之談，詎事實適與此種言論相符，初則紗廠對於貨棉，並無熱烈之表示，迨棉花輸入之後，竟至無人問津，卒因此而引起廠家有所要挾之誤會，但自去秋迄今，進口外棉，確大减少，紗廠似又未嘗舍此棉而另購他棉，則要挾之言，亦無　矣，時日悠忽，又告一歲，貸棉恊訂，卽將滿期，當局亦認識貸棉不易銷售，不得已而再與美國商减，由四千萬金元减爲一千萬金元，此事在我國近年之政治經濟史上，固屬一大問題，而其經過之變遷，似尤足資研討，茲從統計土略加申述，闡明上棉不能銷售之原因，藉供討論貸棉問題者之參考，　　二十二年五月六日美國傳來貸欵購棉消息之後，國人所最關心者，一爲我國是否能容納如此大量之棉花，其次則輸入大量外棉對於國内棉產之關係，卽足以壓低棉價，影響棉農，此兩點誠爲討論貸棉問題所應注意，然我人當時引以爲慮者，不在乎此而在此項棉花之能否輸入我國，所謂影響國内棉產，必待其輸入而後始有影響，如根本無輸入之可能，則其輸入後之關係，自亦無須杞憂，但前述之能否容納此棉與吾人所慮之能否輸入，其意義不相同也，　　從過去海關報告觀之，向美貸欵所購之棉，初不足以引起國内能否容納此項棉花之疑問，最近三年我國進口外棉之比較如下，（單位擔）　　十九年　二十年　二十一年印度來　二、一三一、九九０　一、八一一、０七六　四五三、六二九美國來　一、二八八、八三０　二、五七三、七五七　三、一０二、三五一其他來　三一、六七四　三０三、二四八　一六三、五四三共計　三、四五六、四九四　四、六八八、０八一　三、七一九、五二三　　吾人當時從棉價上估計貸欵所購之棉，大約爲二百萬擔左石，約合六十萬包，如僅以棉價計算，不止此數，但益以費用税金，購數不，過如此，以二百萬擔之數量，持以與上表比較，除十九年外，均無不能容納此棉之虞，故汪精衛院長，在中央報告，亦根據海關進口數字，申述政府借棉之理由，或以爲外棉輸入我國，並非悉由華商紗廠消費，國内日商紗廠，錠數旣多，且多紡製細紗，所用美棉必多，政府貸欵購棉，以維持華廠爲立塲，似不能售諸日廠，若限售於華廠，勢將不能容納矣，此說自有理由，但政府向美貸欵購棉之本旨，爲貸欵而購棉，抑爲購棉而貸欵無從識其眞相，如爲貸欵而購棉，則售與日廠，不成問題．茲卽以政府救濟華廠原料恐慌，爲購棉而貸欵，不能售與日廠，要亦不致發生大量過剩，下列一表，爲全國紗廠廿一年銷用棉花以紗廠國别分類之比較也，（單位包每包五百磅）　　華廠　日廠　英廠　共計中棉一、０一０、０二六　二四二、一一三　一三、九四六　一、二六六、０八五美棉　四七六、七二０　三六三、六五七　六七、七五四　九０八、一三一印棉　一一０、二四一　八九、八六二　四、七０六　二０四、八０九埃及棉　一、五二八　九、七七一　—　一一、二九九其他棉　四五八　一三四　—　五九二其計一、五九八、九七二　七０五、五三七　八六、四０六　二、三九０、九一六銷用美棉　，一年間爲四十七萬六千七百二十包，較貸棉之六十萬包，計少十二萬四千包，如計算廠家存棉及輸入棉包實重不及五百磅，（平均約四百七十五磅）則差數尚不及此，故貸棉卽使限售於華廠，亦無絕對不能容納之慮也、　　其次所謂影響國内棉價問題；此點比較値得研究，但就當時中外棉價及棉價之趨勢觀之，似亦不致發生重大之影響，例如二十二年六月間，中美棉價比較，美棉輸華售價，已須高出標棉十餘元之多，超過中美棉價差率之常數甚大，如此高價之美棉，輸入我國不特不致壓低華棉，或且因而引高國内較低之棉價，有人以爲政府售棉時，或須稍貶儊價以圖脫貨，雖彼時當局一再聲言，絕不廉售，然終不能使人無疑，不過政府卽貶價百分之十，每担約以五元計，其價格仍須高出華棉十元，依然不致壓迫國内棉價，殊無疑義，况就當時情形，觀察未來棉價，中美棉價差率，猶有繼續擴大之勢，則貸棉輸入，益無壓迫華棉價格之可能，至於此種觀察之理由，容後述之，　　然則吾人何以對貸棉之能否輸入我國，引爲疑慮，所謂能否輸入我國者，卽此項棉花將來陸續運到，能否順利的有顧主承受，如無顧主承受，或雖有人承受而不甚順利，卽足以阻滯此棉之輸入，但上年四月間，紗廠方以棉貴紗賤它實行减工，廠家對於貸棉，似應踴躍購買，不患無顧主承受，惟是一切事業，俱隨時間而變遷，工商業之進退起伏，不特速度奇快，亦且範圍甚廣，四月間紗廠固因棉貴紗賤而减工，顧至貸棉消息傳來之後，棉花之供求及市價之轉變，已未可與四月間同語，且紗廠所感困難，厥爲棉貴，而外棉之貴尤甚於中棉，是貸棉之出路，自不能以過去棉荒爲觀察之中心，而其足以引起吾人對於此項棉花能否輸入我國發生疑問者，仍在前述之市價與供求兩端，不過前者爲過去的，而吾人之觀測乃未來的，觀測之根據，則基於統計之表示得之，　　第一爲棉價問題，前刋第一表及第二表，均顯示輸入與消費美棉之多，推其原因，國内紡紗支數提高，需要長絨棉較多，固有關係，但最大原因，實爲中美棉價變動之支配，紗支提高，絕不致使銷棉有急轉的進退，蓋可斷言，茲以中棉美棉及印棉之價格作一比較如下，　　美棉　原價　換算價　　印棉　原價　換算價　中國標棉二十年一月　一０·００　四二·五０　一七三·００　三二·五一　三四·四五　　　六月　八·二五　三八·七七　一五九·００　三四·四五　三七·八０二十一年一月　六·二五　二五·四四　一五九·四０　—　三０·八五　　六月　五·００　二二·０四　一五０·二五　二三·二三米二七·００二十二年一月　六·００　二八·四四　一八六·二五　二八·九九米三二·五五　　六月　九·０五　三四·四二　二０三·二五　二九·五０米二二·四０四二十三年一月一０·四五　二九·八三　一八八·五０　二六·三四米二　　（註）本表所列價格，均爲該棉該月之最低價，原價爲該棉在本國市塲之價格，美棉爲紐約密得林現貨價，印棉爲孟買白洛去近期價，換算價爲以原價照當日匯兌改算爲每担華銀價，（單位兩）但運費稅捐等未列入，中國標棉二十一年六月以後，（卽有米記號者）與二十一年六月以前，種類不同，前者爲漢口及沙市花標凖後者爲鄭州標凖，兩者價値相差約一·七五兩，故比較時應將有米者减低一·七五兩，　　上表所示近年世界主要棉價之進退，頗足徴象世界棉業之大槪情形，自二十年一月至二十一年六月間，美棉與印及美印棉與中棉價格差率，（以換算價計）有顯著之變遷，美棉與中棉之差價，由較高而降爲較低，二十一年一月份中棉竟高於美棉達五兩之鉅，印棉與美棉之趨勢亦復相同，此卽二十年與二十一年間美棉進口激增，及向來輸華較多之印度反趨减退之原因，故過去美棉大量進口，非盡由於紗支提高，實受價格支配，可以證明，但自二十一年六月份美棉低於中棉達最高度後，趨勢又告轉變，適與過去相反，漸趨復其舊觀，吾人再檢閱美棉進口統計，亦隨此轉變而逐上减少，自二十二年六月以後，爲尤著焉，　　二十二年美棉對於中棉差價之復其常態，在統計上早予我人以明白之表示，美國限制植棉之宣傳，爲時已久，至二十二年而益具體化，美棉之慘跌，由於生產過剩，限制植棉，自足引棉價之回堅，其次美總統羅斯福一入白宫，卽宣布其復興計劃，首先施行抑低幣値以提高物價之法，以言棉花，因幣値减低，價格自然上升，在美國原不成問題，但對華之換算價，則稍有變化，蓋我國之美滙，因國際貿易入超過多，其跌價（卽放長）不能與美國金銀比價呈相等之比率，致美棉換算價升高愈甚，此種現象，在上年美棉貸欵發表時，已甚顯著，上表二十二年一月與六月美棉換算價之激變，足爲明證，如將逐月價格完全記出，則其趨勢尤爲瞭然，彼時羅氏之藍　運動，方告開始，此種情形，尚在繼續演進之中，是以吾人已能預料今後美棉換算價對於中棉價格之差率，將易於擴大而難期縮小，則美棉對華輸出，將因價格上之阻礙而漸减，亦可推想得之，再就印棉言，其價格又顯有轉跌之勢，卽使國内因棉產缺乏必購用外棉，亦以購印棉爲多，政府在此種情勢之下，向美貸欵購棉，吾人遂不得發生能否順利的有顧主承受之疑慮矣，　　第二爲供求問題，二十年及二十一年進口美棉增多之原因，在價格方面，已如前述，此外尚有國内棉產供求不足之關係，國内紡錠，幾於逐年增加，而國内棉產，則徘徊於七百萬担左右，原棉之供不敷應，遂與紡錠之日增而愈甚，此卽自民八以降，棉花入超與歲併進之原因，十八年國内棉產降至七百五十萬担，因之十九年進口外棉達三百四十萬担，十九年國内棉產雖增到八百八十萬擔，然以上年供繪之不足，及二十年紡錠激增五十萬枚，而當年棉收又復大歉，故二十年進口棉花再增至四百六十八萬担，本年棉收之豐歉，共供求關係，不僅限於本年，因自新棉上市以至翌年新棉上市以前，俱與本年之棉產有關，故欲表示棉花之供求情形，以棉季（自本年八月一日至翌年七月底止爲一季）爲宜，下列一表，卽以棉季計時，比較近年國内棉產增減與外棉進口之關係，惟進口外棉以上海計，好在我國輸入外棉，百分之九十以上由上海進口，與全國總數，相差甚微，無　於比較也，（數量單位，美棉埃及棉爲五百磅包，印棉爲四百磅包，中棉爲担）　　（第四表）　進口外棉棉李　美棉　印棉　埃及棉　國内棉產十九至二○　三八七五一二　三二四　七六四　七五０二　八八０九五六七二○至二一　一０六九二一三　二七一七九六　九一０五　六五九九七八０二一至二二　三四五０五一　一七二五一六　一二八五０　八一０五六三七二二至二三　一六二三二四　八二二五九　三三五０　九六二一二四０（註）二十二年至二十三年進口外棉僅六個月，至二十三年一月底爲止，國内棉產地十二年爲第三次估計數，　　國内棉產增減，對於進口棉花之進退，盈虚消長，如影隨形，於此可見二十年及二十一年外棉輸入驟增，完全爲美棉價廉及中棉歉收之故，因國内棉產常苦不足，致棉價在各種農產品中，指數甚高，自二十一年秋季還，米麥逐步下落，棉價雖跌，顧不若米麥之甚，因此二十一年長江流域，前遭水災之棉田，迅速恢復，二十二年初春，穀價愈低，從物價上已有棉田將增之勢，五六月間，吾人已陸續獲得各省棉田確有增加之報告，而下種及發芽經過，又頗順適，本年棉產，已頗具良好影象，詎五月六日華盛頓忽傳來向美貸欵購棉消息，原知國内棉產，縱卽增加，無論在數量或品質上，仍有需求美棉之必要，然吾人根據棉價及新棉情形，深覺此舉有不得其味之感，以言救濟棉荒，早則應貸棉於二十年或二十一年今棉荒之嚴重時期漸去卽欲貸棉，亦須待至本年棉產略有把　之後，俾能計其盈虚，以爲貸棉之標準，因此棉旣於二十二年至二十三年一季間輸入我國，則此一季間國内之棉產額，自應先有相當之認議也，　八月一日全國棉產第一次估計發表，棉田計三千九百十五萬畝，產額一千零七十三萬担，較二十一年增二百五十萬担，較二十年增三百三十萬擔，國内紗錠固屬繼續增多，然就棉業情形言，停工程度，有日漸增大之勢，銷棉數量，大約不致隨紗錠而俱增，若與二十一年至二十二年一季間之消費相等，則在全國棉花供求統計上，因國内增加二百餘萬擔之產額，對於外棉需要之減少，縱不致卽與國内增加之數相同，然而大減殆無疑義矣，再分析估計報告之各省數字，完全出產長絨棉之河南陜西入出產巨量長絨棉之湖北，產量增加最多、卽陜豫兩省、已增八十餘萬担，此八十餘萬擔棉花，在品質上皆足以代替美棉，故吾人在此項估計發表後，益信政府貸棉之必不易順利的有顧主承受也，　上述兩點，初非有待於目前而始發見，關於棉價，在二十二年春季，已有極顯著之表示，凡稍注意國際間棉價統計者，甚易認識，卽棉產問題，在二十二年夏初，留心國内棉產者，亦能獲得相當之徴象，故貸棉消息發表，從貸棉數量上及運輸期限觀之，已能預料貸棉契約之必修改，非減少數額卽延長時期也，農村典當業的崩潰及其對策  王宗培　　典當是「受當物品爲業」的金融機關，在錢莊業没有發達之前，佔了商業上很重要的地位，東家大槪是當地的富紳巨賈，經理更是社會上景仰的人物。牠們吸收私人的存欵，地方的公欵，往往了存給牠們··擔負了調劑社會與個人的金融的責任；地位的優越，責任的重大，也可想而知了。自從錢莊業發達之後，在都市中間，典當漸漸地失去固有的權　，等到銀行業代興，典當業更相形見絀，局促於一隅，到現在，除了「受當物品」的本身業務而外，當年的威風，早就一掃而空了。至於内地的缴鎭和偏僻的縣城，錢莊，銀行，還都在十分發達，居民十九是務農爲業，典當在這種區域之内，還能保持相當的地位，不失爲唯一的農民金融機關。　　典當雖說是唯一的農民金融機關，但根據一些不完備的統計來觀察，全國的典當業，並不怎麽發達。據内政部民國二十年份的統計，江蘇等十六省，二百十八縣的報告，共有大小典當一千二百八十三家，平均每縣的典當數，不滿六家，每家的平均資本不過一萬五千餘元。這一個統計，雖然殘缺過甚，（有九省的報告，在六縣以下）但觀察平均數，大致也差不多。記者本人在浙省服務的時候，也曾拿當稅的收入，來推算浙江的典當數，照民國十八年間的稅收，全省七十五縣，共有典當三百六十五家，平均每縣的典當數，統扯不滿五家。至於江蘇，據另一個材料（見中央銀行月報第一卷）告訴我們，江蘇四十二縣的統計，連上海市的典當在内（質押不計），也不過四百五十四家，如果照六十一縣平均，每縣約七·四家。兩省的綜合平均數，每縣有典當六家，和上述的全國平均數，也還接近。下面是内政部民國二十年江蘇等十六省的典當統計底一個大槪··表一　内政部民國二十年江蘇等十六省典　　當統計表省名　報告縣數　典當總數　每縣平均典當數江蘇　二二　一四六　六·六浙江　二九　九七　三·三江西　三　七　二·三湖北　四　八　二·○湖南　二　七　三·五廣東　二三　二三八　一○·四貴州　三　一○　三·三河北　三二　八二　二·六山東　六　八　一·三遼寗　三六　一一九　三·三吉林二七　三二八　一二·一熱河　四　四　一·○察哈爾　二　二　一·○寗夏　四　一二　三·○靑海　三　六　二·○新彊　一八　·二○九　一一·六合計　二一八　一、二八三　五·九　　資本總數　一九五九六、一四九元　　每家平均　一五、二七四元　　江浙兩省是全國的富庶之區，經濟狀况比什麽地方都得一些，可是這兩省的統計，典當總數不滿一千家，而且浙江省有百分之三十二的縣區（卽二十四縣），江蘇也有百分之三十一强縣區（卽十九縣），還没有典當的開設，這是何等嚴重的一個問題。要是照人口來推算，江蘇省平均約七萬七千人有典當一家，浙江省較低，約計平均數爲五萬六千五百餘人。照省區面積來平均，江蘇省低一些，平均每八三七方里開設典當一家，浙江是八五一方里才有一家典當。如果從典當的分佈來觀察，江浙兩省的典當，大槪都集中於少數社會經濟比較發達的地方。這一種情形，江蘇省比較顯著，大約因爲工業發達的關係。至於大多數的地方，典當便不很多，只有寥寥數家吧了。　　表二　江浙兩省各縣典當次數分配表典當家數浙江省江蘇省　縣數　百分數　縣數　百分數一至五　三三　六四·一七　一九四五·二四六至一○　八　一五·六九　八　一九·○五一一至一五　六　一一·七六　九　二一·四三一六至二○　一　一·九六　三　七·一四二一至三○　○　○　○　○三一至四○　二　三·九二　一　二·三八四一至五○　○　○　一　二·三八五一以上　一　一·九六　一　二·三八合計　五一　一○○·○○四二一○○·○○　　江浙兩省的情形如此，内地更可想而知。據我們所知道的，緣省會所在的洛陽，南昌等地，現在還没有典當，那種窮鄉僻壤的所在，當然更不必說了。典當業的偏榮於工商業發達的區域，而不能普遍於全國，這是不可掩飾的現象，關心農村金融的學者專家，誰都應該加以十二分的注意。一方面我們固然希望典當業的逐漸推廣，可是目前的嚴重局勢，更應該設法挽救。事實告訴我們，在近年，典當的數目，每年都在减少，漸漸地走向没落之路。典當有衰落，並不是局部的現象，也不自今日始，從辛亥革命到現在，這二十多年，從通商大埠以至於内地的鄉鎭，眞不知道有多少地方，受了影響，使典當不得不停業，例如洛陽，南昌等處，到現在還没有恢復營業，重新開設。到最近數年、衰落的波浪，又蔓延到富甲全國的江浙兩省，過去一年間，江浙的典當業的呈請省府救濟，更是露骨的表現。研究衰落的原因，我們可以分三點說：　　）一（内亂的影響自辛亥武昌起義到現在，連年的内亂，各地都遭受相當的兵燹，在内地鄉鎭，典當是最大的企業，大牆門高房子，很受匪人的注意，所遭的損失也頂大。有好多地方，典當因爲内戰而遭受損失，不得已停業。像洛陽等等地方，時局又不見有澄清的希望，兵災更隨時有發生的可能，所以典當停業之後，到現在還没有恢復營業。近幾年匪共更有組織的横行，全國各地，都承恐怖中過日子，典當的衰落减少，更成了意中之事。　　）二（風氣的轉變五四運動以後，是中國社會轉變得頂快頂劇烈的一個時期。西洋文化，固然只不過是比較地大量的輸入，人民的生活程度，却飛也似的暴升起來。都市的淫奢逸樂，人民們陶醉在物質的慾望衰。典當在這個情形之下，更多光顧的貴客，業務也似乎更來得繁榮。可是分析了受質的物件，無疑的衣服是居最多數。在這一個轉變的時代，服飾當然也跟着改變。今天大袖，明天高領，花色的翻新，更層出不窮。受質的衣服，經過相當時間的保藏，早就變了没落的東西，失去了時代的價値。到了那時候，出售已生了問題，更談不到本錢的收回。　　（三）利率的限制典當的利率，本來不很低，月息二分三分，是很普通的。可是國民政府建都南京之後，明令限制偕貸利率，規定最高不得過週息二分。這一個令下來之後，頂吃虧的·便是典當，一方面市塲借欵利率是那樣高，同時當票上的利率，又必須减低到月息一分六厘，一切的開支，又都比從前昂貴，能够開支過去，已經很不容易，那能談得上　錢生利。俗語說「千做萬做，蝕本生意不做」典當的减少，這也是一個原因。（未完）商業新聞金融例假日金融市面安穩　—錢莊收解仍繁—　　昨爲星期例假、銀行休業、進出本絕稀少、茲以四底已屆、各種乎續卽須清理完結、故錢莊收解不因星期而稍遜色、洋拆市面、亦仍爲六分、早午市同錢莊洋公單收解三千八百餘萬、各路滙欵三十餘萬、長期欵項計交割一百八十餘萬、新做三百四十餘萬、拆票交易早市轉賬四百二十餘萬、新交易二十餘萬、午市交易四十餘萬、小總會中交易五十餘萬、洋押欵交易新做出一百三十餘萬、輔幣市面、大致平穩、江南小洋早市爲八百四十三元、較前日小七元、究因現貨不裕、午市復趨俏利、爲八百四十六元、結果較前日跌落四元、做出交易、早市八千五百角、午市六千五百角、廣東小洋、早午兩市同爲七百四十四元三角、較前日小一角、做出交易、早市一萬零五百角、午市二萬角、銅元較前日加長五百、爲三百二十八千文、交易數額三萬二千八百串文、合代價洋一萬元、　　　早市　午市洋拆　六分　六分江南　八百四十三元　八百四十六元廣東　七百四十四元三角　七百四十四元三角拆兌　一千三百四十三角五分　一千三百四十三角五分銅元　三百二十八千文　三百二十八千文衣牌　三千二百八十文　三千二百八十文角坯　二百四十四文　二百四十四文貼水八十四文　八十四文證劵上週債市起伏甚大　　上週四月二十三日至二十八日、華商證劵交易所除二十七日爲交割停市外、祗做五日交易、一則因交割前後、一則因環境形勢頗多變化、市價升降起伏、波濤頗鉅、更以投機家欲利用時機、壓小市値、使多頭恐慌、適在交割前後、市價本亦甚高也、查週一因國際空氣惡劣、空方活動、且以本月期祗餘二日、繼續前週、略有軋多形勢、跌落半元、週二爲本月份最後一天、上午仍係軋多、下午兩盤轉爲軋空、此亦因數日來均係軋多之反響、市價略好半元、週三國際空氣嚴重、市面祇做五月期、抛賣者湧、市價續小半元餘、週四國際形勢俞嚴重、大有山雨欲來之狀、空頭乘機竭力壓迫、市價逐盤縮小、一日間多者竟降落一元半、惟賣方之力量如何、尚未能測知、週五交割停市一天、週六報端形勢、比較混沌、開盤狂跌一元餘、次盤卽起反漲、收盤更因日本軟化而狂漲、市價自經此打擊後、其反動力亦較平日爲强、綜計一週市價結果、大都尚小去數角至一元餘、成交總數、計共九千二百六十萬零九千元、内現貨祇九千元、茲將一週經過市價結果、比較列表於後、（單位元成交單位百元）　種類　現期　最高　最低　較前週　成交數一八關　關四月　三０·七０　三０·五０　跌０·一五　一、一００又　　　五月　三０·００　二九０三０　又０·五五　九五０編遣　四月　四０·九０　四０·四０　又０·一０　五、０００又　五月　四０·四０　三八·九０　又０·０六　一一、三五０又　六月　三九·一０　三八·四０　新做開　開一、四五０裁兵　四月　七五·二０　七四·二０　漲０·二０　二二、０００又　五月　七三·七五　七一·三０　跌０·七０　七六、六００又　六月　七三·二０　七一·三五　新做開　一二、七五０又　現　七二·五０　……　跌二·００　一０一九關　四月　四六·００四五·六０　漲０·三０　五、五五０又　五月　四五·０五　四三·四０　跌０·四五　二一、七００又　六月　四三·七０　四二·三五　新做開　八、二五０一九善　四月　五０·九０　五０·六０　漲０·０五　五、七００又　五月　五０·一０　四七·八０　跌０·七五　一九、九００又　六月　四八·五五　四六·七五　新做開　四、二００廿捲　四月　五一·九０　五一·四０　跌０·一０　九、九五０又　五月　五五·三０　四八·一０　又０·九０　二二、三００又　六月　四九·七０　四七·六五　新做開　七、二００廿關　現　五一·二０　……　漲０·五０　一０又　四月　五０·九０　五０·四五　跌０·二五　一一、一五０又　五月　五０·七０　四八·二０　又０·八五　四五、八００又　六月　四八·九五　四七·三０　新做開　七、九五０廿統　四月　五四·００　五三·五０　漲０·四五０又　五月　五三·五五　五０·七０　跌０·五　六一、九００八又　六月　五一·八０　四九·九五　新做開　一０六００又　現　五三·六０　……　不動　一０廿鹽　四月　五五·五０　五四·八０　漲０·三五　三二、五五０又　五月　五四·八０　五二·００　跌０·七五　一二四、六００又　六月　五二·八０　五一·二０　新做開　一七、七五０金長　現　四八·００　四七·二０　久未開　四０金短　現　六六·五０　……　漲一·五０　一０又　四月　六六·八０　六六·二０　又０·０五　一五六五０又　五月　六七·一０　六四·二０　跌０·六四　七三、三００又　六月　六六·五五　六四·七０　新做開　一二、七五０整六　現　六一·００　……　跌０·二０　一０又　四月　六一·八五　六０·九五　漲０·六０　六、九００又　五月　六一·八五　一九·五五　跌０·六五　三三、０００又　六月　五九·七０　五八·一０　新做開　六、四００九六　四月　一０·六０　一０·四０　跌０·０五　三三、八００又　五月　一０·七五　一０·００　不動　九四、八００又　六月　一０·七五　一０·四０　新做開　二、０五０金長　四月　四七·二五　四六·五０　跌０·七五　五五０又　五朋　四七·０四　四六·八０　又０·一　　三００二二關　四月　六四·七０　七六四·二０　又０·二二　六、六　０三又　五月　六四·五　　六一·四０　又一·二０　四八、０五０又　六月　六二·一　　六０·　０　新做開　八、一００紐約股市跌多漲少　　新豐洋行報告云、昨物品雖堅、商業消息　　順利、但以投機家袖手旁觀、　待國會討論交易所案之結果、證券市塲致乏領袖、市况略退、春季之汽車營業將近高峯、汽車股略有出籠、又據代理人報告、（證券）、收盤前發生抛風、惟抵抗力頗佳、（小麥）　旱區無雨、消息惡劣、雨水無望、大衆開始購買、市况可望再高、（棉花）膨脹情勢大形减退、市面乃將據棉花之本身情形轉移、紗廠地位不安、進胃衰弱、而影響收成之各項勢力、現時又尚難談到、故目下除爲向上反動外、無買進動機、惟苟有新發展、因地位優良、極易上騰、（橡皮）市况因多頭了結、及限制損失委託到限價後自動賣出而跌、抛出者除係投機性質、實際情形未變、（白銀）現貨仍有大量購進、半日成交五十六萬股、茲將道瓊斯紐約指數列左、　　四月廿七日　四月廿八日三十種實業股　一０三·六五

<p>申報醫藥周刊自然界之啞謎  宋國賓自然之謎曰生與死　抵抗求生生存之旨　　在宗敎家講起來，人們生在世上，是爲死後上天堂的預備的。這樣，人的生，是爲死而生的了！我覺得這種見解、自有他的用意之所在、不能講他是錯誤，但是我們從科學上來觀察，從科學的醫學上來觀察、所得的結論適得其反，就是一切的生物，皆是爲生而生的。　　達爾文的學說，證明了天地間的萬物，皆在競爭着生存，勝利的自然可以達到牠的生存的目的，失敗者那就惟有終歸於淘汰而已！所謂「競爭」這兩個字，就很有點眞理。天地間的萬物無時無刻不在戰爭之中、大之如人類，小之如細菌，便是一個最好的例子。　　最不可理解的是自然界，而最可理解的也是自然界，盈天地間都是細菌的世界，細菌是人類的大敵，那麽，人們的敵人，不是充滿了全世界麽？人類要求生存，惟一的方法，祇有不斷地向細菌宣戰，反之，而細菌要求生存，也非得不斷地向人類進攻，以開拓牠的殖民地不可。這樣，一切的生物不是時時刻刻在抵抗外侮之中麽？爲求生存而抵抗，因抵抗而獲到生存。這就是自然界的一個大啞謎。　　有人說：自然界旣然生人，爲什麽又生害人的東西——細菌呢？這正是自然界可以理解的地方。何以故呢？人們四肢百體的每一個細胞，都具有抵抗外侮的能力，假使没有外侮，這種抵抗工具就根本的無所用之了！而人們呢？也就毫無警惕，毫無顧忌的縱慾無度了！一切不道德的行爲，不衛生的舉動、皆可以任情的做出來了，自然界明白了這一點，於是造出人類的敵人，使得人們不得不時刻的加以驚惕，同時又給與人們一種抵抗的工具，使得可以抵抗外侮，假使人們善用這種抵抗的工具，自然可以得到生存。如果縱慾了！不衛生了！抵抗的能力就减低了！外侮也就乘機襲入了！「無敵國外患者恒亡，」國旣有之，物亦宜然。　　達爾文又說：「適者生存，」「適」之一字，是最合於眞理的了！自然界對於一切的生物，有兩種不同的處置，一種就是生，一種就是死，有生没有死，那麽宇宙不能容納了！反之而有死没有生，世界不是變成廣大的空塲麽？所以自然界對於一切生物，皆給與牠一種壞的環境，而同時又給與牠一種抵抗環境的工具，抵抗得過去，就適宜於這種環境就謂之適應，就可以圖生存，抵抗不過去，那就是不知道適應，不適宜於這種環境，就歸於滅亡之路。　　一切的生物，皆是爲生而生的。但同時却充滿了使他不能生存的元素。於是不得不抵抗了！生存是生物的目的，抵抗是達到這個目的的工具。所以生物是無不能抵抗的，不抵抗的祗有死物，這不是自然界一個秘密嗎？　　生物旣然要抵抗才能生存，那麽國家呢？也何嘗不是如此。所以戰爭是終久免不了的，在戰爭的狂氛中想圖生存，只要看你能够抵抗與否。供獻給年靑及未來的母親們（一）  郭大施　　當一個家庭裏將要有嬰兒的時候，大家都懷着熱烈的心情，望眼欲穿地期待着他的降臨。可是在這些小天使未曾呱呱墮地之前，一定要有相當的凖備，嬰兒的衣服，尿布，小小的浴盆，和鋪設得合乎衛生的小牀，及其他細屑的東西都要早須預備妥當，不致臨事忙迫，要使他們初臨人間，立刻就感到快樂和適意。關於孩衣及尿布，最緊要的是要大小合度，同時要有足够時常掉換的套數，下面列着每個嬰兒所需要的衣服和尿布，這是約略的數目，如能多備幾套，對於看護和母親自有補助：　　尿布第一層（卽最裏的）約十八件，原料以薄質及柔軟的布爲主。　　比較厚些的包布，約十二件。　　厚的棉布尿布（這些在夏天或者嬰兒睡在溫暖的牀上的時候是用不着的。），約十二件。　　絨布做的尿布，約六件。　　織成的外衣，約六件。　　襯衣，約六件。　　寬緊帶，約六件。　　那些薄的尿布（卽貼肉的一層），五定要用頂軟墊和稀疏的原料做成，而且不要有摺疊的地方而致擦傷嬰兒的柔嫩的皮膚。尺度以三十二吋見方爲最合式　　較厚的第二層，最好用麻布式夏布做成的。　　棉布的一層以厚的毛巾布爲最合宜，尺度以十六吋長，十二吋闊。最外的尿布必須多孔的絨成做成以便使裏面的各層容易乾透。　　襯衣一定要長袖子的，因爲可以保護嬰兒的小手不致受冷，外衣以質地優良的棉紗織成的爲適宜，羊毛或半羊毛的原料祇是合乎寒冷的時候，當嬰兒睡在溫暖的床上時，是不適當的，還有一點不要忘記的就是嬰兒的外衣，衛生衣，和内衣的袖子，不要太狹窄，因爲這會使小兒時時感到不安的。　　用以束縛尿布的寬緊帶宜擇其富有彈性而不要太緊的，更在容易洗滌，這些在大店家或藥房都可買得到的。　　嬰兒的帽子，在冬天的時候，要用羊毛織成的，手織和機織都可以，但是在夏天，嬰兒必須帶着輕便的可以遮避强烈日光的照射的小帽。　　Ｘ　Ｘ　X　X　　上面所說的是關於嬰兒在初生幾個星期的，過了相當的時期，這些小性命，正在伸手踼足的時候，除了襯衣，外衣，及最薄一層的尿布照常應用，其他的包布等物完全用不着了，這時需用着短褲而同時也就開始要穿襪子了。可是有許多的孩子穿着奪褲，就用不着穿襪子，襪子不可太緊，襪帶也不可用圓的，因爲這樣會使嬰兒的血液流通不便。　　當小兒能够站立和開始行走的時候，最好穿拖鞋或短統的小鞋子，這樣可以使嬰兒的足踝有勁。　　嬰兒宜使其獨睡一床，因爲和大人睡在一起，受了大人所呼出炭酸氣的影響，是極碍衛生而容易傅染着疾病的，還有一層，就是當母親熟睡着的時候，有時不經意地竟會使嬰兒被壓榨着而受傷。嬰兒的床必須安放在房間裏最光亮的地方，如果放置在黑暗的地方，就很容易發生一種眼神經的衰弱症—眴目或睡目！　　初生的嬰兒在每日廿四小時中要睡足廿二小時，六個月後要睡十六小時，一年後十四小時，所以在嬰兒的日常需要品中，床是最緊要的物質。　　褥子和枕頭都要蘊藏着馬鬃和海草，這樣可使嬰兒避免潮濕及軟骨症。褥了上的橡皮套，至闊不能超過二十吋，如果過大的一層，會使空氣流通不便，是極不俣乎衛生的。　假使嬰兒的身體是很軟弱的，最好在他的床上，安放着兩個關得很緊的熱水袋，　助嬰兒抵抗着零冷的包圍。　　爲着嬰兒皮膚薄嫩的緣故，所以很容易感到汚穢和皮膚不潔的難過，因此每天替他沐浴是必須的。在未曾入浴之前，一切手續要預先凖備妥當，先把清潔的衣服，和浴巾取出，然後用溫度表測量浴水的溫度。大約在華氏表九十五度，攝氏表三十五度，最爲適當。如果溫度過底，會損失小兒自身的熱力。在浴盆裏，把嬰兒靠在左手裏，用右手輕輕的仔細替他洗滌，頭稍抬高，勿使水流入耳内，或者不致使小兒吃到浴水。　　浴後，立刻替他揩乾，對於女孩子的生殖器等處，尤須揩得乾凈，使汚穢及微生物不致侵入體内。　　有時嬰兒身上生着痱子或其他皮膚的輕病，做母親的要輕輕的替他揩乾，然後把粉撲上。　　有時嬰兒由於食奶過多，身上發出微細的紅點而且感到過份的不適意的時候，至切不要替他洗浴。分的嘴裏也不要去揩抹。如果嬰兒的皮膚病是微菌所致、最好是請醫生騐看。　　嬰兒的指甲和趾甲及腦後的毛髮，都要時常修剪。洗好了浴，就給他吃奶，然笔把他放在床上，讓他熟睡，所以替小兒洗浴的時候，最好是在晚間，因爲經騐告訴我們說這樣可使嬰兒得到甜蜜和健康的睡眠。　　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　　現在我要把嬰兒的消化的經過和其他大槪的情狀述及一下：　　嬰兒身體的搆造是尚未生長成熟的，我們知道一個孩子從他的床上或玩車裏跌到地上的時候，他的骨頭，因爲軟弱的綠故，所以輕易是不會跌斷的，他的頭骨也未長成，在頭頂上有一個空缺的地方呌做頂門，這個要過十八個月才長閉。　　在嬰兒出世的兩個星期裏，我們對於他的肚臍要特别注意，使其乾透，否則像「鎖牙」這一類的病就會發生的，還有一種嬰兒很容易發生的疾病，稱爲黄病或黄疸病，這種病並不顯露着一些病態。　　有時我們會看見嬰兒的胸部腫着而且竟會流出奶水來，大多數的人是不肯相信的，但這却是有過的事實。這種胸部的膨脹，自已不久便會逐漸的消失，大人切不要用手去掀壓，頂好用溫要和的浸透了油的綳帶裹着胸部。</p>

<p>什麽呌做催生針？（上）  丁名全　　（一）那種針藥是屬催生針？　　這種問題，當然答案並不一致，因爲時間的關係，所用的藥品是不同的，嗎啡這樣藥品，無論何人，都說不是催生針，然而用在一個神經疲乏，生產無力的產婦時，雖然她得了此針要安睡一些，然而她睡了以後的陣力比注射隨便何種催生針還好，因爲這針能安神經，使產婦有休息之時期，可以養新力來奮鬥。　　至於普通所用及著名的催生針，我想總不外乎垂腦腺後葉汁，及金鷄納霜二種，前者已有人竟把催生針之名以代表之，當然此地我們不能確承認這種名詞是對的，第一此種針並不是一定用在產科内的，第二並不是個個生產不前進者所可用的。　　的確是我們二十世紀人民所得到的特緻的幸福，因爲這種垂腦腺後葉汁用在產科内爲期不二三十年、此藥對於我們很辛苦的產婦，假使我們用得適當，的確可以省了許多悲哀的事實。　　至於垂腦腺後葉是什麽東西，那不是數言可盡的，假使我們大約講的話，那末這腺汁是一種内分泌腺在大腦之下，藏於頸骨之蝴蝶骨中，因此腺有三部份，功用完全不同的緣故，所以我們在產科所需要的一部份，呌做後部，這後部的液汁有一種特緻的能力，能使平滑肌肉收縮，尤其是子宫，還有特長的地方，便是上藥能使子宫收縮，是有一定時的，换言之，子宫得此藥後有縮有放與陣痛一樣，因此我們逢到陣痛衰弱的時候，往往用此藥以除之，而所得的效果極佳，因爲陣痛衰弱，大部份是發生在胎兒未產以前，所以用之以助陣痛，胎兒生產的速度，當然可以因此而增加。　　垂腦腺後葉汁，有了這樣大的作用，所以亂用的人也就非常之多，因此發生的危險也就增加，甚至有很多半知半解之徒，竟借此以成就他們的生意，這是非常可恨的。　　金鷄納霜發明雖已久，但是在產科中用之者還是很少，因爲他的作用又是特緻的，金鷄納霜的藥物本來作用是一種破壞細胞者，在人體上有殺瘧菌之功（因瘧菌是一單獨細胎動物），其對於產科上，則有助於陣痛之能，但是極少自動產生陣痛，只有在陣痛已產生後、而有衰弱之時，那末用此藥非常合宜，反之，在陣痛未產生以前，此藥的功效便不一定。　　還有金鷄納霜這樣藥，用的份量非常重要，在臨產時，我們所用的份量是不能同治瘧疾的份量那樣重，假使此地用了太重的話，那這藥的作用非特不使陣痛增加，反可减少，此其一，另外我們用此藥最好分數時期與之，那牠的作用更有特緻的效力，用此藥普通的份量，照我們的經騐，是每半至一小時零點零伍克至零點一克，但總數不得過一克，若過一克仍無效，那此藥便對於該產婦是不發生效力的，不過，此種現象是很少的，大半在一二小時以後，陣痛卽增加。兒童近視之預防（上）  郭人驥　何謂近視眼　　吾人生而近視者殊鮮。蓋產生之時。大抵爲遠視。及稍稍成長。漸成正規。至十歲前後，稍呈近視，普通在二十五歲左右。其數始大見增加。且其近視亦增進。　　所謂近視眼者。眼球之形。向前後延長。吾人眼球。宛如照相器械。自外界物體發出之先綫。大抵爲水晶體所屆折而集於眼底之綱膜。綱膜與照相器中之乾片相當。物體映於綱膜。則能明視。反之綱膜退往後方。則物體糢糊而不能明視。是曰近視眼。可依照相器械以實騐之。近視眼視察近物雖明悉。然視察遠處則不明瞭。須御適當之眼鏡。則遠近咸能明視。然依統計。近視眼中六分之一。因其近視之度過强。雖御眼鏡。不但不能見人。且因其眼底發起變化。其重者。甚有致盲目者。　　近視之原因何故發起近視乎？凡爲近處工作。尤以研究學問者易陷於近視。讀書。寫字。針黹。手工。以及一切近處之工作。所謂近業者。厥爲近視之最大原因。自不待言。然孰能完全停止近處工作乎？迫不獲已。惟有在其近處工作時。加以注意。無他道也。此外頭部充血。濫用目力。運動不足。亦得助成近視可知。然近視之原因。不僅在是。眼之素質。亦大有關係。卽生來易罹近視之眼。若受上述近業或其他種種之惡影響。眼球逐漸延長。而成近視。且其度逐日增進。　　不可逼近視物之注意　　（一）限制近業之距離。　　讀書。寫字、針黹之際。其與眼之距離。須在一尺以上。是爲必要。　　（甲）必須限制書籍字體之大小。　　近年新聞雜誌文字。大爲縮小。因而不知不覺之間。必須在一尺以内。方可閱讀。靑年時代。幼年時代。尤須注意。禁閱讀細小文字之書籍字典爲必要　　凡六歲兒童用書。須用特號字。　　凡七歲兒童用書。須用一號字。　　凡八歲以上之兒童用書。須用二號字。　　年少之人作甚小之字。繪細微之圖畫。及手工。針黹等。對於其眼。均有不良。　　（乙）印刷鮮明。亦爲必要。印刷於粗陋之紙者。或其顏色太濃者均不易閱讀。故爲兒童選用圖畫時。尤須注意於此。　　（丙）因光綫不足之故。自然令其眼逼近視物。黄昏或夜間燈火之下。作細微工作。亦與眼以大不利。　　（丁）在汽車電車中。身體簸動之時。閱書。因而眼力疲勞。不知不覺之間。逼近視物。亦須注意。　　（二）端正其姿勢姿勢不良。不僅逼近視物而已。屢使頭部發生充血。此亦爲近視之原因。德國之某學者。曾將猿二匹。放入箱中。每日一定時間傾倒之。令其頭部發起充血。而觀察之。六個月後。二猿發起頗爲强度之近視。由此觀之。端正其姿勢而後讀書。對於近視之豫防上。至爲必要。其理亦自明矣肺結核淺說（三）  胡嘉言　　前面已經說過、結核菌是任何身體部分。幾乎都被侵襲的；所以除肺部以外的皮膚骨骼泌尿器腦膜的結核，當然都是此菌在裏面作怪的。不過直接的證明，没有像痰唾檢查那樣便當罷了。如果我們將眼光擴大一點，他不僅侵襲人體，就是家家飼養的幾種動物。也是一體待遇，不分上下的。其中以牛結核係最重要，另外像猪羊馬狗兎猴幾種動物，都有患結核病危險的。還有一種係專門侵襲鳥類的，但在哺乳動物中的馬猪鼠等，也有少數的證明的。所以近代細菌學者，因爲他侵襲的對象，有人類牛和鳥類三個方向：並且形態生殖情形，也微有不同。根據這點，將結核菌分出三個種類來。這裏面的詳細情形，我覺得太嫌專門了、不是普通一般人所可領略的，所以在本篇中也不再嘵舌了。　　在肺結核病人痰裏面，除去結核菌外，有没有其他的病菌呢？這一個問題，我想讀者一定是要問的。不錯，像連鎖球菌葡萄球菌二種，在本病人的痰裏而，是時常發現的；另外像假性白喉菌，流行性感冒菌，有時也有的，但比較前二種少一點。這樣的情形，醫學上有一個特殊名詞，呌做混合傅染。　如一肺結核病人，臨時兼患氣管枝炎症，就會見着的。但無論如何，肺結核病唯一的原因，是結核菌作怪，當然毫無疑問的；上面所舉的幾種，不過是賓中之賓罷了。第二章傳染之原由及其途徑　　肺結核之爲傅染病，在一般社會裏面，是早已知道了，這是可以拿事實來證明的。在尋常的家庭裏面·如果·有一個患了肺結核，對於病人的飯碗食箸茶杯，以及最接近病人的種種用具，他們大慨都知道是應該和非病人分開，不能共用的。當然呢，有少數利已心狠重的病人，或且病人是一家中的長輩尊親，狠不願這樣舉動的；但他們面子上雖不動聲色，骨子裏是仍舊實行的。這樣的情形，當然不是家家如此，但是我們看見的實例是確實不少；並且這種人並没有受過近代科學醫的洗禮，是狠明瞭的。對於病人的痰唾和衣服，他們雖然不懂得消毒的方法，但勤於拭淨和洗滌，也知道是應該的。像這樣的事實，我想讀者們大慨總不至於没有見過罷！但肺結核的傅染，是無孔不入的；無數的科學醫，用盡種種法子，還是没有效果；像這一點常識，祗曉得對於接觸傅染一方面出發，並且還没有做得周全，那裏能搖動絲毫呢。紀念項茂松先生  編者　　項松茂先生長五洲藥房幾二十年。手創五洲固本皂廠。以精良國貨抵制外貨。利權之挽回者不下數千萬元。九一八後抱愛國熱忱參加義勇軍組織。爲日人所嫉視。一二八滬變起。五洲第二分店地處虹口。逼近敵營。店員十一人被擄。先生兩度親赴戰地營救。卒於一月三十日遭捕。翌日遇害。家屬搜求遺骸二年不得。乃於本年四月十六日衣冠成殮。嗚呼先生之死不僅新藥界失其中堅。我國工商界之不幸。亦實爲國家而犧牲。足資我人之景仰者也。値茲紀念。爰錄其傅略於後。項松茂先生傅  黄炎培　　先生姓項，名世澄，松茂其字，别號渭川，浙之鄞人也。其先自湖州徙永嘉轉定海，清康熙初内遷鄞之東鄉打網　，七傅至錦三，隱居不仕，以孝友聞於鄉，嘗傾已財清昆季積逋、配吳氏，登耄壽，政府贈孳孝揚麻額，有丈夫子三，先生其長也，以光緒六年生，岐　異常兒，稍長善屬文，顧以貧去習賈，入上海中英藥房司會計，旋之漢口創中英分店，著信譽，業日以隆。上海夏粹芳重先生德與才，禮聘經理五洲藥房，顧方不振，自得先生主持，期年而興，不十年而分店徧各地，嘗親走日本考查藥商業，遣有志靑年赴歐美考查製藥，歸而設廠自製，兼製皂，固本商標壓倒東西舶來貨，五洲裒然爲上海同業冠，先生之力也。民國二十年九月日本猝占遼吉，舉國憤賊至極度，相戒盡斥日貨，練義勇軍謀自衛衛國，先生與倡焉，翌歲一月二十八夕敵犯滬北，軍民合力死抗，時五洲支店在靶子路，當敵營，難旣作，店員十一人被擄，先生馳救不得，歸語他員，吾誓往脫十一人於厄，或沮之，慨然曰，居高位者致人於危，而自圖安，吾恥之，吾長五洲，吾不往救，誰往者，蹶然行，遂不復返。數日後，有目擊者述先生旣抵店，立被擄，問爲誰，夷然以名對，縛而送之蓬路敵俱樂部，詰旦送江灣敵營，敵盛怒問，若店曷爲藏服械，若敢抗耶，抗無赦，先生植立憤然答，死則死耳，中國人愛中國分也。且誰激之斥敵貨者，爾我同種，不謀所以共存，乃以兵占有我土地，屠殺我民衆，噫此亦豈爾福，敵方一人，聞而大動容，爲緩頰，至於長跽，卒被害，時三十一晨也，年五十有二，同被害十一人，蔣邦毓，虞耕豐，童永才，戚德江，丁兆年，徐知傑，陳漢坤，吳宸良，陶賦，李生才，周瑞龍。先生天性至純厚，旣迎養母至滬，定省罔間，雖深夜歸，必趨寢所問寒暖，述新聞瑣事爲笑樂，旣寢必就榻撫衾裯覆護之，加以按摩，俟入寐乃退，十年如一日，待二姊一弟咸有恩，旁曁族戚，歲時周恤，母殁，茹素志哀終其身，訂族譜，復先人祠墓，有墓在定海，迷失所依，母憶述，百計旁求，終得之大洋　，其待友也尚道義，重然諾，緩急叩門，不爲辭解，一言一行之著，一技之長，揄掦如不及，廠店員工數百，訓之有方，督之有程，工餘有會，以相娱樂，過相規，難相恤，相視如家人子弟，而信賞必罰，以公以明，不能欺，不敢欺，亦不忍欺，故雖勞資之爭洋溢國内外，而先生所主工商業不及焉。有旁記先生行事者，謂其與廠中工人家中僕人談話，態度一如其與政府要人社會聞人，則其風槪可知已，尤能嚴别公私界限，雖以便治中故，移居廠屋，而必納賃金如額，生平於地方敎育，慈善自治，凡諸公益捐金，積計達二十萬元圓以上。民國七年歐戰猶烈，創議作歐戰紀念繪畫，售得如于萬圓，以振國外，因兵禍失所者，後雖以故改資僑滬西人，建歐戰紀念塔，並移捐紅十字會，而先生初意實主救災恤隣著於中外報紙焉。政府嘉其義，授三等嘉禾章，聘授農商部諮議，先後任上海市商會議董，上海租界納稅華人會理事，紅十字會特别會員，工商部國貨展覽會委員，中華國貨維持會執行委員，機製國貨工廠聯合會常務委員，中國工商管理恊會專門委員，華商皂業公會主席委員，浦東電汽公司董事，大豐工業原料公司董事，明錩機器廠董事長，不具述。先生生無他好，惟好金石書盡，嘗發願蒐羅先德墨林軒故物，就幼所受讀崇潔堂庋藏，以時展覽，而未逮也。娶於樂，生男隆勳，續娶於李，生隆沐，隆周，隆漢，隆虞，女培珍，孫秉熙，秉淳，孫女秉炆，秉煒，旣遇害，隆勳檢遺物於故紙堆，得先生手書聯語，讀者肅然，文曰：平居宜寡慾養身，臨大節則達生委命，治家須量入爲出，徇大義當芥視千金。論曰，人固有一死，先生之死，可謂大矣。國變猝發，全國憤興，顧滔滔中肯舍已利以利國者幾人，至於舍生，更無論已，先生恥夫居高位者致人於危，而自圖安，嗟乎，百年來自湘鄉曾氏後，久不復聞此語，不圖出諸工商者流，當其蹶然遂行，但知有責當盡，有義當赴，更安有一身利害生死觀，及其被縛侃侃而道，詞嚴義正，天下有共聞之，先生其不朽哉，及考内行，覽遺墨，更知其素養深矣。</p>

<p>自由談	小品文的生機  崇巽　　去年是「幽默」大走鴻運的時候，「論語」以外，也是開口幽默，閉口幽默，這人是幽默家，那人也是幽默家。不料今年就大塌臺，這不對，那又不對，一切罪惡，全歸幽默，甚至於比之文塲的丑脚。駡幽默竟好像是洗澡，只要來一下，自已就會乾凈似的了。　　倘若眞的是「天地大戲塲」，那麽，文塲當然也一定有丑脚—然而也一定有黑頭。丑脚唱着丑脚戲，是很平常的，黑頭改唱了丑脚戲，那就怪得很，但大戲塲上却有時眞會有這等事。這就使直心眼人跟着歪心眼人嘲駡，熱情人憤怒，脆情人心酸。爲的是唱得不内行，不招人笑嗎？並不是的，他比真的丑脚還可笑。　　那憤怒和心酸，爲的是黑頭改唱了丑脚之後，事情還没有完。串戲總得有幾個脚色：生，且，末、丑，凈，還有黑頭。要不然，這戲也唱不久。爲了一種原因，黑頭只得改唱丑脚的時候，照成例，是一定丑脚倒來改唱黑頭的。不但唱工，單是黑頭涎臉扮丑脚，丑脚挺胸學黑頭，戲塲上只見白鼻子的和黑臉孔的丑脚多起來，也就滑天下之大稽—然而，滑稽而已，並非幽默。或人曰：「中國無幽默。」這正是一個注脚。　　更可歎的是被謚爲「幽默大師」的林先生，竟也在「自由談」上引了古人之言，曰：「夫飲酒猖狂，或沉寂無聞，亦不過潔身自好耳。今世癩　，欲使潔身自好者負亡國之罪，若然則「今日烏合，明日鳥散，今日倒戈，明日憑軾，今日爲君子，明日爲小人，今日爲小人，明日復爲君子」之輩可無罪。」雖引據仍不離乎小品，但去「幽默」或「閒適」之道遠矣。這又是一個注脚。　　但林先生以謂新近各報上之攻擊「人間世」，是系統的化名的把戲，却是錯誤的，證據是不同的論旨，不同的作風。其中固然有雖曾附驥，終未登龍的「名人」，或扮作黑頭，而實是眞正的丑脚的打諢，但也有熱心人的讜論。世態是這麽的糾紛，可見雖是小品，也正有待於分柝和攻戰的了，這或者倒是「人間世」的一線生機罷。方巾氣研究（二）  林語堂　　「人間世」出版與「論語」出版一樣。因爲沒人做，所以我來做。我不好落人窠曰，如已有人做了，我便萬不肯做。以前研究漢字索引，編英文敎科書，近來研究打字機，也都是看别人不做，或做不好、故自出機杼興趣勃然去做而已。此外還有什麽理由？現在明明是提倡小品文，又無端被人加以奪取「文學正宗」罪名。夫文學之中，品類多矣。吾提倡小品，他人儘可提倡大品；我辦刋物來登如在自由談天天刋登而不便收存之隨感，他人儘管辦一刋物專登短篇小說，我能禁止他麽？倘使明日我看見國中没有專登偵探小說刋物，來辦一個，又必有人以我爲有以奉偵探小說爲文學「正宗」之野心了。這才是眞正國貨的籠統思想。此種批評，謂之方巾氣的批評。以前學者名流，没人敢辦幽默刋物，就是方巾氣作祟，脫不下學者名流架子，所以逼得我來辦了。　今日「大野」君在自由談勸我「欲行大道，勿由小徑，勿以大海内於牛跡，勿以日光等於螢火」，應先提倡西洋文化，後提倡小品。提倡西洋文化，我是贊成的。但是西洋文化極複雜，方面極多。五四的新文化運動，有點籠統，我們應該隨性所近分工合作去介紹提倡吧。幽默是西方文化之一部，西洋近代散文之技巧，亦係西方文學之一部，文學之外，尚有哲學，經濟，社會，我没有辦法，你們去提倡吧。現代文化生活是極豐富的。倘使我提倡幽默提倡小品，而竟出意外，得倡有效，又竟出意外，在中國哼哼唧唧派及杭唷杭唷派之文學外，又加一幽默派，小品派，而間接增加中國文學内容體裁或格調上之豐富，甚至增加中國人心靈生活上之豐富，使接近西方文化，雖然自身不免詫異，如洋博士被人認爲西洋文學專家一樣，也可聽天由命去吧。近有感想，因見上海弄堂屋宇比接，隔簾花影，每每動人，想起美國有自動油布窗幔，一拉卽下，一拉卽上，至此無人「提倡」「介紹」，也頗思「提倡」一下。倘得方巾氣的批評家不加我以「提倡油布窗幔救國」罪名，則幸甚矣。　　在反對方巾氣文中，我偏要說一句方巾氣的話。倘是我能减少一點國中的方巾氣，而呌國人取一種比較自然活潑的人生觀，也就在介紹西洋文化工作中，盡一點點國民羲務。這句話也是我自幼唸慣「今夫天下」之遺跡。我生活之嚴肅人家才會詫異哩。隨筆之類  陳子展　何謂中國　　　自四夷言之，華夏稱中國，固已。清季戊戍維新運動之際，湖南湘學報刋有醒世歌，或云出自經學家及鹿門先生之乎，而託名其子所作。歌中有句云：「若把地球來參詳，中國並不在中央。地球本是渾圓物，誰居中央誰四傍？」意在袪閉關自大之結習，而助變法維新之波瀾，故云中國不在地球之中央，卽不必以古之所謂四夷目今之海外諸邦也。不謂守舊派葉郎園（德輝）先生見之，犬不謂然，有致皮先生一札，略云：「地球圓物，不能指一地以爲中，但合東西南北考之，南北極不相通，則論中外，當視東西矣。亞洲居地球之東南，中國適居東面之中，無中外，獨無東西乎？四時之序先春夏，五行之位首東南，此中西人士所共明·非中國以人爲外也。五色黄屬土，土屬中央。西人辦中人爲黄種，是天地開闢之初，隱與中人以中位。西人笑中國自大，何不以此理曉之？」何謂中國？有此一解，豈不妙哉！　　活孟子　　唐有林愼思爲續孟子二卷，以孟子自居。元有胡長孺　務明所謂本心之學，慨然以孟子自許。至于明代，則有稱爲「活孟子」者矣。明儒陳獻章之學，據謂以　爲主，灑然自得。其敎學者，但令端坐澄心，於靜中養出端倪。當時論者謂陳氏有　飛魚躍之樂·至有稱之爲「活孟子」者。又有文人桑悅以怪妄稱，蓋患誇大狂，自稱「江南才子」不足；復以孟子自况。桑悅與陳獻章年代相及，一時「活孟子」有二，惟一則爲人所稱，一則自稱之耳。或曰今人亦有自稱爲「江南才子」者，顧未知其以「活孟子」自况否也？論「天眞」  吳容　　我於基督敎的内幕，不甚了然，只覺新約中說的唯有孩子可以進天國的話，也有幾分意思。孩子一切都不如成人，可是還不至於不如到不知生活，不要生活。你如不給他喫，他餓得難受便會不管任何塲面都拉長了臉皮哭喊；你如給他喫飽好要，他也不管眼角還是掛着眼涙不是，便會嘻起兩張唇皮來笑。這就是所謂天眞。而孩子並不自知爲天眞，更不知道天眞可以掛招牌出賣。　　孩子的天眞的可取似乎就在不知道天眞可以掛牌出賣。得以純循生活的自然去運用他的笑哭本份。　人間世是趨炎附熱的多。在近世間我們只聽得有人在「賣笑」，而未聽得人誰在「賣哭」。足見只有笑會有人買。雖然哭者大有人，不但不能賣，甚至還有于碍。「哭聲直上干雲霄」，也是世間少有的獃子記下來的。　　我們的人間世的規條是：只許嘻起兩張唇皮笑，不許落下兩片眼皮哭。樂得笑，苦亦得笑；閒適得笑，忙苦亦得笑。天生的一張臉皮被人成了吳越兩國：普天下都是助嘴而抗眼。或者對於等是這隻眼這張嘴的動作也都分成了勢不兩立的兩黨：普天下的人都是黨嘻皮而仇所謂「哭喪」。於是嘻皮笑臉滿天下。　人多不知一味嘻皮反天眞，而反以爲是天眞。而天眞亡。如今而欲尋天眞，只有向孩子或類乎孩子的獃子班頭去找世人多以「天眞」與「超脫」連說，其實也不然。我國的幽默大師金聖嘆曾說，「殺頭，至痛也，而聖嘆以無意得之，大奇」。這可以名爲超脫，而不能呌做天眞。假如是天眞，不要說殺他，就是嚇他也要哭的。超脫者，超脫生活也。以爲生活不成間題也。而天眞則是要生活，隨着生活，將樂作樂，苦作苦，閒適作閒適，忙急作忙急。　　天眞的人不會有阿Ｑ式的幽默，以懦怯爲英勇以冰冷爲火熱。他不想談狐說鬼，來一手以神道設敎，他也不明白爲什麽聽見狐鬼悉眉打結，就算是有道學氣方巾氣。　　他們的天眞是純循生活的天眞，而非超脫生活的天眞。世間如其眞有生活的天堂，進去的怕還是這班不知道方巾氣的天眞的孩子乎？故鄉行（四）  林微音　　我那樣地望了一回，便仍回到了石家飯店的門前。可是我不想到房間裏去，只看了看水牌，看兩個也說好要去鄉下的親戚來了没有。他們還没有到。我想上靈岩去，可是我又不想眞去。我在不絕地想到那在木凟的僅有的一家親戚，雖然我在動身前是决定了不去的。因爲是决定了不去的，我没有問清楚這十餘年來的他們的家庭狀况，只模糊地知道他們時常在死人，死了那一些人却不知道。可是我在想去；而且一邊想，一邊已在向他們的家的方向前進。　　到了那里，見敞屋中没有人。我有些畏縮。可是終於我走了進去。臨近裏面的廳堂，我聽到了打牌聲，這壯了我不少的胆。我踏進廳堂，那最小的兒子，我該稱他叔叔的，就看見了我。他在不久前在上海住過，因此我們彼此還認識。他從牌桌上站起來招呼着。我請他繼續打下去，我就坐在他的旁邊、在打牌的還有一個我還記得，是那一房的媳婦。其餘的兩位少婦我以前簡直没有見過面，想來也是我的叔母輩。他一邊打牌，一邊在同我閑談着。他告訴我婆婆，他的母親，已到鄉下去。我不敢問他公公，因爲我不知道他已死了呢，還是還活着。生疏到這個樣子，我感到了抱歉。不久聽到有一個咳嗽聲在從外面進來。個在看打牌的孩子。　　得知道了他還健在，我便輕快地站了起來。　　進來了，他告訴他誰在那里。他聽到了，並看到了，很是喜歡。　「舊年春天說，小姐和你要來，我們天天盼望着，」他回憶地說。　　我記不得說　要去，　是怎樣誤傅了的；可是我回答的是本來我們要去，後來給什麽事　往了，脫不出身。　接着他便訴着寃。他說了他在聽金槍傅，說：「我們的一」家眞像楊家將—你看六個就死剩了他一個。」　　這使我感到了窘迫，因爲我不曉得說什麽話才好。　　牌打好了，就預備着點心。吃了麵，他要我一起去看看小花圜。　　說是小花圜的是一個就在他們的後面的新開的花樹鋪。　　「最毒婦人心」這句話是一些也不錯的，」他突然慨嘆地說，在遠望着而評價着花樹的時候。　　那句突然的慨嘆使我驚異，因爲他已是一個將近七十歲的人了，我想不到他對於人事還會這樣地不肯放鬆。來函照登　　烈文兄：今日見郭明謝雲翼二先生與弟函，用意破壞私人感情，謹答數語，以釋疑惑。此後如有誠意批評人間世内容或編法之文，不妨發表，弟亦必接受。若徒作意氣話頭，殊覺無謂。語堂　　致郭明謝雲翼先生函　　郭明雲翼先生：閱悉本日自由談所登致弟尊函，雖知二位忙人，未必有暇親擬此信，然此信之發表，欲使汝我破壞感情甚明。弟前文只謂「有人登龍未就，在人言週刋，十日談，矛盾月刋，中華日報，自由談化名投稿，系統的攻擊人間世」，而來函認爲弟謂「人言……亦曾作系統的攻擊」，正欲使個人避開鋒頭而使汝我交惡也。且欲使「十日談」關係輕，使「人言」關係重，此法亦妙矣。是京幻龍新術，豈但所精研之登龍術而已。此君共有七篇文稿攻擊弟個人（最近一篇「談訣」登在今日收到之第二十七期「十日談」）故謂之「系統的」。只須效文素臣正眼一覷，照出其爲俗物，而非龍，使現原形，一切平安大吉。弟决不受其欺愚而對二位發生誤會，而先生亦幸無坐聽一言論機關變爲私人發洩意氣撒僞龍尿之地。函中語辯不完，故不辯　　順便聲明，弟始終推許「人言」而鄙夷「十日談」。日前退出「人言」編輯委員會而必須在啓事上聲明者，乃因爾時弟已决定主編「人間世」，不欲外間以我爲跑街婆也。語堂敬覆篇中世紀的小說（三）  美國ＭａｒｌＴｗａｉｎ（尊寒譯）　　可是在爵府的偏僻的一室，却有着一個完全不同的塲面。公爵的獨生女康絲坦絲郡主倚着一個窗户。她的兩眼紅而且　，滿含涙水。屋子裏祇有她孤零零一人。她開始悲歎起來且高聲說道：　　「那殘酷的德清侯來了，——我的美麗的公國消失了——這事我是永不能相信的，——唉，但這毫無懷疑的餘地！——而我愛了他，我愛了他，—我敢於愛了他，雖然我知道—我的父親，那尊貴的公爵，——不會允許我嫁他！—我愛了他—我愛了他—我恨他。—我究竟怎麽了？—我瘋了，瘋了，瘋了！—現在一切都完了！—」　（三）　　幾個月過去了。—一班人民都稱讚着靑年龔娜的政府。每個人都恭維他裁决的賢明，判斷的寬大，和他執行最高職務時所具有的謙遜。不多久，那老公爵便把一切事情都讓給他處理，而自已却坐在一旁，懷着一種含有傲意的快樂，傾聽自已的繼承者從首相的座席上宣讀公爵的裁定。一位像靑年龔娜一樣受着一切人愛戴和頌揚的儲君似乎可以很幸福了罷。但，奇怪的是他竟不然。因爲他非常惶恐地看到公爵的女兒康絲坦絲郡主愛上了自已。世界上其他一切的愛對於他雖很寳貴，但這一種愛却是滿含着危險的。並且他還看到那快樂的公爵也發覺了女兒的情慾，而已在暗想把他們結爲夫婦。籠罩在那少女臉上的愁雲逐漸消失，閃耀在她眼睛裏的希望和熱情便逐漸顯明。漸漸地。那至今現得如此煩惱的容顏竟有時浮上了飄忽的微笑。　　龔娜驚懼到了極！他痛責自已不該輕易表示出那種使他在初到這兒，感覺生疏時，尋覓一個和自已一樣的女性來往的親切的情意。他那時抑　而又焦灼，趨向於一種祇有女人才能希望或感受的友誼。他努力逃避他的堂妹了。但這樣反使得事情更壞，因爲，自然啦，他越避她，她便越要設法和他碰見。他起初對這事感到驚異，隨後便感到恐懼了。這簡直成了一種糾纒，一種追逐。晚上和白天，她隨時隨地驀然出現在他面前。她現得特别不安似的。這裏面有着一個秘密。　　這事是不能繼續下去的。這成了大衆的談料。公爵也現得惶慾起來了。恐懼與煩惱和那可憐的龔娜形影不離了。某天當他從圖畫陳列室前面的一間小廳走出來時，康絲坦絲突然立在他面前，拉着他的兩手，呌道：　　「啊！你爲什麽逃避我呢？我究竟做錯了什麽事，說錯了什麽話，以致毀壞了你對我的好感呢？因爲以前我是確乎取得了你的友誼的。請不要賤視我罷，龔娜，請你可憐我這痛苦的心罷。我再也不能沉默了。沉默會把我弄死的。我愛你。　娜！請你賤視我罷，如果你能够的話。這句話却是應當說出來的。」　　龔娜默不作聲。康絲坦絲猶疑了一下，隨後，對於他的沉默發生了誤解，一種粗野的歡喜在她的兩眼裏閃耀着；她把兩手　的着他的頸項說道：</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言振作民氣與活動外交  夢若　　國家的力量，政治軍事經濟而外，民氣和外交兩者，亦甚重要。民氣旺盛，則國家呈勃興之象。外交善運用，則國家可獲多方之利。故一個國家無論如何衰敗，只要民氣不死，外交靈活，這個國家就有轉機的希望。中國今日之所以一蹶不振，雖緣於政治軍事經濟之薄弱，而民氣的消沉，外交的無能，亦是一大癥結。　　我以爲今日而言救國，增進政治軍事經濟諸實力，固然緊要，而振作民氣，活動外交，亦爲兩個急切的方略。蓋民氣一振作，政府便有後盾，無論對内對外，皆可增加許多力量，卽敵人見之，亦不免膽怯，知我國之尚不可侮，外交一活動，在國際間亦能取得幾分助力，不至孤立無援。　　要怎樣振作民氣？第一步應先由言論界喚起全國人民的覺醒，俾國人知道國勢已臨於千鈞一髮的絕境，非羣策羣力，共赴大難，終無以圖存。第二步再由有力者將全國人民組織起來，作一番轟轟烈烈的救國禦侮運動。第三步須全國加緊致力於抗日工作，以制敵人的銳氣。第四步應嚴厲督促政府趕快做種種凖備，以便應付未來禍患。第五步卽是實行全民武裝，於萬分危急之時，下寗爲玉碎不作瓦全的决心。　　至外交方面，現在正是我匣活躍的好時機。我外交當局，應乘列强對日下總攻陣綫，極力拉攏與國，以加强我國聲勢。今日我駐外外交官員，須具機警的心思，敏捷的手腕，多方與各國當局分頭接洽，交換意見，窺探各國的方針，規定我國的對策，遇日人在國際上有顚倒是非，淆亂黑白的宣傅，應立卽反駁糾正，免使眞相爲奸人所蒙蔽。更不可坐視日人縱横勾結，施展其於我國不利的舉動。對日交涉，尤須改變從來容忍屈服的態度。誰說弱國無外交，我以爲國家之弱，卽外交無能有以致之，不過這里所說的運用外交，並不是依賴外人的意思。國際援助之不可恃，已於滿洲事件中給我們不少敎訓。卽以此次新發生的事實而論，列强對日反動，亦只是站在本身利益的立塲而發，何嘗有眞正援我制日的用意？但列强現在雖没有把和日本直接衝突的决心，而坐視日本之强大，亦非牠們的願望。故只要有機可乘，在外交上，我們尚有活動的必要。　　雖然，人必自救，而後人救之。我們雖一面要利用機會，得到外交上的援助，而最迫切緊要者，還是自已國民的振作。我們在學校中所得到的是什麽？  已而　　當一個人初進學校的時候，必然要做着很美滿的夢，希望將來在學校中，能够培養成一位學識豐富，技能充實，人格優善的完人，以便爲本身謀立足之地，爲社會圖發展之策。等到幾年後，由學校畢了，再轉過頭去看看，在那求學期間内，究竟所獲得到的是些什麽　　有不　　　　　　　　。　　第一，關於知識方面。校中所得到的，不過是一些極有限的零碎的，膚淺的，不切實際的東西，那里算得上學問？學校之安排課程，根本没有計劃，没有系統，没有標凖。每學期要開若干門或何種學程，純以所聘請敎師之多寡，及敎師所能擔任的科目爲定。因此，有些課程幾乎每季多佔有位置；有些課程則經過一二年，尚未見開班。且常忽略其比較重要的，而選共不重要的。又如某學科本應兩期授畢者，縮短爲一期，某　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。甚至有的僅敎　一半，便中途停止了。這對於學生的學業上，是有着如何的影響，稍有常識者都能明白。至若敎師方面，學識廣博者，未嘗没有；混飯喫的，也不在少數。敷衍是他們敎書的原則。三天一事，七日一病。上課時，他們雖然指手劃脚，講得天花亂墜；結果學生得到的，却是「空空如也」！　　次之，關於生活方面。我們經過幾年學校生活，却養成了許多不良習慣。驕奢逸樂四字，大約可以說盡學生生活的形態。富有人家的子弟不必說，校中八人一桌的飯菜他們是咽不下肚的，三頓要上館子去點珍　，挺直的西裝，發亮的革履，間天換一樣；不必是星期日，也可以把工課放下，進電影院跳舞塲去尋歡娱。這些是他們應得的權利，因爲他們有的是「麥克麥克」。卽比較清寒者，因爲受惡劣環境的薰染，也常趨於享樂之途。每見一班初自内地或鄉下來求學的學生，最先生活甚然儉樸；但不久之後，也就漸漸學起時髦來了。而學校又盡取放任態度，未嘗留心到學生的生活方面。像學生只要繳納學費，跟着鐘聲上班下課，學校便算已盡了責任似的。　　其三，關於技能方面。說來也是非常傷心的，一無所長！「死讀書」，是今日我國敎育的特色。除了幾種職業專門學校外，我們在學校中，就只會唸講義，抄筆記。考試時，大綱背得熟，答案寫得出，分數自然多，人也便算是優秀學生了。至於你有没有什麽技能，那都是不關大體的事！　　現在我國從事敎育者，有幾個是眞正熱心於敎育的？他們不是把　　　　是一種慈善事業，或作爲一個政爭黨爭的利器；就是以學校當爲喫飯的根據地。以這樣精神去對付敎育，無怪中國敎育一日衰敗一日！而近來知識份子之一無出路，也正是這不良敎育所表現出來的成續！雖然，靑年學生本身之甘自暴自棄，不思奮發，也是不能辭其咎的！歌者  汝惠　　他環視着圍在四邊的人羣，眼裏帶着慘黯的光彩，晶瑩的涙珠，從眼角裏偷偷地滾下；他俯下頭去，枯黑的手指，重又無力的顫顫地撥動琴絃。絃聲響了，凄凉的聲調，散在落寞底空中，嗚咽地帶着哀傷。　　四圍的人羣，睜圓了眼，望着這流浪的歌者；可怕底沉默，表露了大家酸苦的神情，在心靈的深處，激起了人類同情底節奏。　　歌者開放了沙　的喉嚨，哽咽地開唱他的悲調：　　「我没有老家，我没有親人；啣着苦杯，飲着涙酒，抑着舊琴，背着孤影，整日亡命在人間。我走遍了天涯地角，我嚐遍了苦辣酸辛，我不再想起那舊日的美境，　　　我不再追逐那失去的心靈；　　我只希望純潔的靈魂，能伴着我的殘生。」　　歌聲中斷了，只剩絃琴的哀鳴，緩緩地飄盪在空際；大家靜着，脚釘住在地上，眼釘住在歌者面上，心追逐着消逝在遠方的歌聲。歌者慢慢地抬起頭來，兩條未乾的涙痕，印在頰上，他伸出手來，請大家施捨一些地能喘延他生命的東西，　　羣衆蠕動着，没有一個肯丢下一枚銅元，他們無言的走散了。在夕陽的光波中，蹣跚着一個絕望的飢者，他抱着唯一的朋友，—絃琴。再走上悲苦的，陰暗的「人生之途。」追不回底靑春！  雅非　　何處去追回吾底靑春；那裏去尋找吾底舊夢！靑春，牠在一刹那就消逝了！舊夢，它也永遠地没有回來底日子！　　靑春是寳貴的，舊夢是溫馨的；吾那可愛底靑春啊！快回來吧！美麗底舊夢啊！吾在想念你哪！　　當吾從孩提而到成年，而到現在；這是値得留戀，値得回憶的一段過程。然而，那無情的歲月呀；它把吾底靑春催走了！那殘酷底生活呵；也把吾底舊夢送去了！唉！不知吾到何年何月何日何時，才能够再來重溫吾童年的舊夢？童年，使吾想起了童年，便會感到無限底悲傷；兩行辛酸底熱涙，也不自覺地向下抛，像斷了綫底珠子一樣，索落落地抛着。　　童年哪！那可愛的童年；你怎麽竟忍心地抛了吾而去呢？吾和你數載相處，現在就願意離開了吾而去找尋另一個伴侣了嗎？啊！可恨底童年，你也太勢利了。　　童年是個殘夢，甚至是一個幻夢；甜蜜的幻夢。人生從童年而至成年，乃是一個必由底階段，而且，也是人人所不可避免底一個途徑。　　時代底巨輪在不迭地向前推進；那抓不住底流光，已如駛般底過去了。吾自從從可愛底慈母懷抱裏跳了出來，投入了那萬惡底漩渦—社會，於是，終日只在人生底圈子裏打着轉；轉着，不停地轉着。　　社會，原像一隻巨大底洪爐；煤和一切燃料，都是人生底環境，生活，便是人生底鐵鎚。人是一塊被放在爐裏練着底鐵。練着、燃着，鎚着，做人本來是够痛苦的！　　現在，生活底鞭子已擊上了吾底肩頭；重重地，重重地，擊着，擊着。吾只有在這無情底鞭笞下伸吟着。同時，悽厲地發出幾聲痛楚底慘呼聲：但是，有誰來可憐吾，同情吾，援救吾呢？這時，也許還有人在旁邊，訕笑地說啦：「該死的窮小子，纔有這樣底一天！」人情本來是冷酷的；何况在這充滿了金錢勢力氣氛底現實社會裏。　　吾不由自主地，在這人海裏飄流了二十多個年頭；可是却始終也没有找到了一些輕微底安慰，除非是在過去底童年時候。　　環境底惡魔，却不由分說地一把將吾抓住了！呌吾怎樣還能够掙扎？吾雖然也曾竭力地掙扎過，但，終於没有掙脫！　　吾已闖進了人生底旅途；可是，吾那滿佈着荆棘底前路呵！只覺得黑暗和危險！吾已是没有勇氣前進了，吾祇得在這裏徘徊，徬徨，恐怖！　　現在吾已受了上帝底審判，被宣判底結果是「無期徒刑」。可憐！吾自已也没曉得究竟犯了什麽罪？上帝竟忍心地給吾受這末殘酷底刑罰：吾惟有盼望着上帝會再來洗禮吾底一日。　　痛苦，悲哀，煩惱，疾病，一切的刑具，都已一一底加到了吾底身上，頸上，甚至於手上，足上。敎吾那微弱而渺小底肉體，怎樣受當得起呢！　　吾在這兒，一天一天底度着刑期中的囚犯生活，凖備着有一天再跪到上帝底聖像面前去，懺悔，懺悔吾過去底一切過失，刷清吾生命史上底汚點，希望他能够减輕吾底罪責；從地獄中，苦海裏，拯救吾出來。　　現在，吾底靑春，到那裏去了呢？它把吾所有底天眞，活潑，幸福，快樂，一起都帶走了嗎？哎！可愛底靑春呵！快回來吧！美麗底舊夢啊！吾在想念你哪！想你們仍舊回到吾底身邊來；和吾作一個永久的快樂伴侣不好嗎？吾底朋友—靑春—舊夢，快回來吧！張善孖張大千兩先生作品游戲與生活  天華　　誰都知道小孩子是愛玩的。小孩子的生活就是一種遊戲生活。遊戲可使人養成集團生活的習慣和樂觀進取的精神。歌唱，表演，運動，競技……之爲近代敎育所重視，並不是偶然的。　　不但小孩，我們成人也是愛玩的。實際上，我們也必須有玩的機會。在目前畸形的社會組制下，人生的不如意事太多，假設不求有所發洩，則我們的生活將不堪聞問了。試想我們終日被惡環境煎迫着，被煩惱包圍着，没有絲毫引起興味的事，那還過什麽日子？我們的天年就必然的會被煩惱啃嚼凈盡我們的生活又將是怎樣的慘淡呵！說到這裏，我記起一則故事。從前有一個衛生家去問醫生，如何可以長壽？醫生問他說，「你喝酒嗎？」他說「不喝。」「你抽烟嗎？」「不抽」。「你有女朋友嗎？」「也没有。」！醫生就告他說，你簡直没有生活啦，爲什麽還要長壽呢？　　這近乎是個笑話，但從這裏我們可以得到一個敎訓。那個衛生家自以爲很講衛生，屏葉一切嗜好，以爲這樣可以長壽。但我們設想一　　像他那　乾燥刻板的生活，會　　使他長壽？他没有</p>

<p>刺激，没有歡喜，没有靑春，一切豐富和充實人生的東西，在他是無緣得到的。在這樣人的臉上會尋得一絲一毫的笑容來嗎？我敢說，在這種人死灰的心裏是没有熱的，他也决不會動情得心跳的。擺在人面前的是一條暗淡的灰色的路　　有和這種道貌岸然的衛生家相反的主張，說是玩才是人生的目的，工作不過是一種手段。這話未免有點過火，但把遊戲看作人生的必需的這一點是並不錯誤的。當然，像一班富商大賈，哥兒小姐，終日無所用心，把遊戲當作全部生活，不是喝酒，打牌，就是玩跳舞塲，或買賣愛情—這種腐爛的生活當然是要不得的。這决不是合理的遊戲生活。這不但不能使人長壽，而且必然因爲生命的浪費而短命。　　我所說的遊戲决不是這些東西。我也决不和那個醫生一樣，勸人家抽烟喝酒交女朋友，來滿足自已欲望，雖然這欲望並不一定是怎末不好——雖然抽少量的烟，喝少量的酒，和中意的女人（或男人）講講愛情，並不一定是有多少大害的。（自然，過度了就有害了）我所說的遊戲是高一級的，貼切點說，是藝術欣賞，遊覽，友朋切磋一類的事。我們可以利用餘閒弄弄音樂，看看戲或電影，到名勝地方遊逛遊逛，或在家讀讀文學著作或和友朋討論什麽問題等。　　在這畸形社會組織下，或許連這一點也是辦不到的。但我們總不宜失去這種樂觀欣賞的精神。我們要進取，要工作，也要有說笑玩要的機會。我們雖不一定希望長壽，但我們總希望能够更長久的爲人類服務。那末說，就只有合理的把工作和遊戲適當的調合着，才是合乎衛生，才能達到這個服務人類的大目的！業餘信箱庸醫編者先生：　　很多的難問題，先生都是解答得十分透切，這是値得佩服呀，先生，我也有件很難的問題，請先生撥冗解答一下，不勝感激，　　事實是這樣：去年廢歷十二月初十日，我妻染病，卽請某醫士二人診治（　　　三人）開方服藥後，病不見减，　見增加，共診四次，至十六日晨卽病　。我妻自得病以來，並未經任何醫生看過，直至垂　時）十六日晨赴上海醫院診治，據該醫院醫生說，病已東及救治。並詳細說明所患之病因病源，查與以前醫生所說，，完全不同，可見我妻之死，完全係該醫生未識病情誤診而死。現在我有上海醫院診單爲憑及該醫之藥方，能否到法庭提起訟訴，並請先生答明該醫生應犯何罪。此頌撰安　　吕雲山謹啓　　答：照吕君所說，尊夫人之病似爲庸醫所誤。但是仔細一想，却也不敢一口咬定「完全係該醫生未識病情誤診而死」。何以呢？「病情」雖是在客觀上存在的，雖亦可根據某幾種現象推出，但這不是溫度，可以用寒署表很凖確地絲毫不誤地測出。尊夫人垂危是經上海醫院診治，「而該醫院所說，與以前醫生所說，完全不同」，這種理由未必就能以斷定爲該醫生「誤診而死」。因爲上海醫院的「診斷」是否可以作爲定論呢？這就難保没有問題了。所以除非我們可以證明上海醫院的診斷是絕對對的，該院醫生所說的病情是確切不移，或者能够提出其他有力的證據時，縱令該醫生診視確有錯誤，我們也很難確定他們的罪狀。何况尊地人現已去世，死無對證，現在又不能再把尊夫人找來，另請高明醫生重新診斷，判明是非。所以，你對於此事，到法庭去告他們雖然可以，但是結果恐怕也祗是一塲爭論而已。你的唯一證據，就是上海醫院的診單，但是上海醫院方面是否可以負責證明該兩醫生確係「誤診」呢，恐怕不見得吧！上海醫院的診斷是否可以作爲標凖，是否可以推定前醫爲誤診呢，恐怕也未見得吧！這樣，你起訴又有什麽用呢？　　但是我們决不是爲那兩醫生說話，我們也頗疑惑那二位是「庸醫殺人」的嫌疑犯。不過事實上他雖有殺人罪嫌疑，但嫌疑郤無從證實，因此我又怎能勸你去告他們呢！不過由此我們郤可以看出，病者對於擇醫之應該如何愼重，政府對於醫生登記應該如何謹嚴、以及醫生對於診斷疾病應該如何仔細。殺人滅跡是一椿難事，但是在醫生郤是一舉手之勞，這該是如何可怕的現象啊！編者小說明天（五）  穆琳　　一陣皮鞋聲從外房傅來，媽忙放了我跑到外面去，是他。他說大姊生了幾天小病，没有到這裏來。今天岳母告訴我說鶯妹要出閣哩，嬸娘總忙着。媽笑着加回答了，他纔問鶯妹呢，我們要討喜酒吃。媽說小姑娘怕難爲情，藏起來了。我本來想走出去的，被媽這樣一說，我不願意出去了，又像對他做了抱歉的事。然而不料他會跑進臥房來——這是第一次，嘴裏還說着瞧新娘子。我忙坐起身來假裝到床底下找鞋子，拭乾了涙痕。他已走到我面前，輕輕地拍了我的肩頭，「小妹妹，吃喜酒哩。」我抬起頭來，他俏皮的對我笑着。他從來没有這樣大膽，我不理他自顧向外房走去。他跟了出來，好像是失望的樣子。　　我坐在媽身旁，媽說：　　「倒底年紀輕，離不開娘，聽見出嫁就哭了。」　　我用手臂暗暗地推了媽一下，他儘對着我笑。　　　……………………　　今天整理書籍時，我坐在書桌前又想起這事來了，一個女孩子會什麽要出嫁，而且要嫁給一個不認識的人。我擬了一個理想的他，和他對比起來，就那樣出了神。眼珠停視在天空的白雲中，好像兩個人就站在那裏，祇要我跑向那一個去，我就是那一個的妻子。　　那我爲什麽要嫁一個不認識的男子呢？　　………………………　　藴姊今天又來信，她說隔兩天就到上海來，問我什麽到校裏去，我好意思去覆牠信嗎？這消息要是傅到校裏去時，那些同學們又要俏皮地來取笑我呢。　　媽起勁地替我採辦一切出嫁時的器具用品。爸死去得那般，她扶養我長大起來，如今到了我出嫁的日子，做父母的心中一定有種說不出喜歡。我自然出得鼓起精神來强裝着笑臉製辦一些零星的東西，雖然媽祇知道我要離開她而傷心。　　他更是每天來，我眞猜不透他的心。媽和他商量什麽，他總能頭頭是道的回答出來，好像他有許多經騐似的。　　今天午後我們要去購買東西的時候，他不遲不早的來了。媽忽然想起了要到舅父家裏去一次，就託了他陪我去，我反覺得有些忸怩，不過這時候是不能有這種態度的。</p>

<p>電影專刊中華民國貳拾叁年肆月叁拾日星期壹「互助」簡釋（中）  頑石　　「是的，我聽得工頭也是這麽說。」……「我不懂你的意思，法國人……」……「你說什麽？」……「那末我們要到那兒去。」（意思爲將去救法人。）……「什麽，你替法國人躭心麽？」……「鑛工總是鑛工，我們一定得去援救他們。…」…「可是你以爲假使你因此遭遇不幸，法國將有贍養費給你嗎？」「但是他們也是有妻子兒女的。」……「還是想想你自已的妻子兒女罷。」……「是的，就是因爲我相過了，所以我們得去救他們。」　　於是他們都到監督那兒去拿毒器口套。這時只聽見德鑛的監督說：「哼，這是法國炭坑一個致命的打擊。」這時炭坑夫們要求工頭說：「把毒氣口套給我們，我們願意去救護他們。」「但是，」工頭說：「事實上做不到，他們那兒不會放你們進去的。」此時監督出來說：「你們要什麽？」工人們答道：「我們要毒氣口套，我們要去救他們，」工人答。監督說道：「你們仔細的想一想，看是否做得很對。」工頭又說道；「那末你們打算怎樣越過國界呢？」工人的回答是：「我們自有辦法。」「好，」於是監督答應了：「給他們罷，你（工頭）領他們去。」　　於是其餘的鑛工們都談論着他們去救護的事。不久，德鑛監督却馬上打電話給法鑛的監督，取悅他說：「密司脫傑偉，我們的救護隊已經出發，我們很樂意來帮助你們。……不客氣，這是我們應盡的義務。」這和上面的事實相對照，可謂幽默滑稽之至。　　救護隊坐着汽車前去，一個鑛工的老婆帶着她的孩子跟着車子哭，她和她的丈夫說：「你不是没有吃過東西嗎？」那鑛工安慰着她說：「不要哭，安娜，你知道他們法鑛工也是有妻兒女的。　　法國少女請敎一個女人，問她到鑛區是怎樣走的。她說她的兄弟和朋友都在那兒很危險。那個老鑛工去救他的孫兒。　　法國邊境的守吏在談論着失火事件。當救護隊的汽車駛來時，守吏欲開槍，旋被阻止；「不要開槍，那是德鑛工的救護隊。」再後德工頭向守吏說；「開門，我們是德國的救護隊。」最後救護隊終於放行，因爲守吏得着命令放他們過去。同時並報告上司，說他們已經放過去了。　　一大羣人在法鑛區鐵門前大哭大喊。這時法少女方淑亦來，看見了她的母親亦在那兒。一個鑛工被救了出來，他說炭坑是全部毁滅了。鐵門外的婦人們不相信她們的男人可以得救，大家想用力衝破那個鐵門。不久，德鑛救護隊到底來了，要求打開鐵門，讓他們進去。少女方淑很驚奇的說：「德國救護隊？眞的嗎？」以後只聽見德工頭向法工頭說：「這是德國救護隊，請你們調動罷。」法工頭說：「我們謝謝你，同時祝福你們。」（未完）影片談評「互助」  羅平·凌鶴·司徒慧敏合評Ｃｏｍｒａｄｅｓｈｉｐ—金城—　　柏勃斯德的力作「互助」，在德國政府的權力壓迫下，遭到了火刑。但是希特勒却没有能够毁掉它在世界上僅有的一部拷貝，藉着這一部拷貝，使我們認識了德國希特勒政府的眞面目。　　「互助」同「亡命者」一樣，有着撼動我們神經中樞的力量。「亡命者」是以正義的憤怒的火來燃燒我們的熱情，但「互助」則以偉大的國際主義來抓住了我們的情緒。　　在「亡命者」中，我們可以看到鎖牢中的恐怖與殘酷，而它不致流於淺薄的人道主義者，完全是在它的能够指摘出這種恐怖與殘酷的社會根源。　　但是在「互助」中，我們不僅是被那煤礦中的可怕的爆炸，少女老奴這一羣工人家屬的焦急，愁慮，聚集在栅欄前的他們的騒動，老礦工的愛他是孫子等所感動，也不是被所謂狹議的人類愛所感動，在這裏，我們看到，就使被魔鬼們桃撥到成爲世仇的兩個敵對民族的工人間，依舊是聯合起來的，所謂「人類愛」這模糊的觀念，在這裏是不完美的解釋，有的只是被壓迫者的階級的合作！　　「礦工是礦工」，德國的礦工也有妻子兒女，法國的礦工也有妻子兒女，同樣是鑛工，同樣是被壓迫者，在某個時期，被魔鬼們用花言巧語的欺騙，造成的民族的偏見，經過了世界大戰，他們已經覺醒了，全世界工人的利害關係是一致的，魔鬼們用「國家」「民族」來分散他們，然而没有用，他們是推倒了國家的栅欄，衝破了國家的牆壁而握起手來了。　　在「亡命者」中，那種黑暗的鎖牢裏的影子，在「互助」中，却是煤礦中的可怖的火災與水患了。柱子的毀折，泥土的崩潰，水管的破裂，每一下打在鋼管的搥聲，正如「亡命者」中的搥打脚鐐與受鞭笞那樣的壓住了我們的呼吸。　　　瞭解礦工的痛苦的只有礦工自已，礦主們在炭坑裏發生了慘劇後，不想立刻去救護，而只是在計劃重行建築起避火牆，他們是只關心自已的利益，没有什麽眞正的人類愛可言的。　　當一個法國礦工發現了一個德國的救護工人時，他幻想起了自已在戰塲上和德國戰爭的事，而同那個救護者打起來，但是德國礦工却不使他受一點傷而救護他，這是很好的一節心理描寫，告訴了我們戰爭究竟給了我們些什麽，只有站在聯合一致的立塲上，打破國家的偏見。　　缺點是没有把礦主和礦工間的不同的觀念更多的描寫，因爲德國礦工的停止了工作去救法國礦工，對於礦主是一種損失。而這樣僅寫了礦工的一方面的眞正的「人類愛」，却很容易被誤會爲狹義的人類愛主義的。　　然而，對於這樣一部難得留下來的偉大的藝人的作品，在重重壓迫之下，我們的指摘恐怕是一種苛求了。　　我們應以極大的熱情來注意這一「互助」，卽使在技巧方面，也値得我們誠懇的學習。　　關於這一方面，最顯而易見的便是他使用着和内容完全一致的手法，將他所要告訴我們的一切，充分的表現出來，非常戲劇化的，電影藝術的地以形象表現了他的思維。　　在此使我們立刻想到他的「伏虎美人和「唐吉訶德。關於前者，因着他以反動的手法，—以情慾的描畫收着正面的效果，看極力描寫那女皇的淫蕩等，而使我們並不覺得那是情慾的煽動，相反的，乃使我們由於那女皇之妖蕩而領悟到作乾所要告訴我們的主題。在此他被人悟解爲情慾主義者，然而那正是他成功的特點　的確，在「伏虎美人」中，他是用了抒情詩一樣的音韻來傅發他不滿於希特拉政治的哀怨，寒夜的鐘聲，一點一滴的打在我們心頭，而在「伏虎美人」之後的「唐吉前德」中，他却用着粗線條的，有魄力的雄偉的手法表現那悲壯的没落的英雄，所謂氣壯山河，雄呑宇宙的氣氛，使我們洒着幾點悲壯的眼涙。　　現在我們再來看他製作在上二片之前的「互助」罷。這一影片製作於一九三一年（所謂本年度十大名片乃是事實的曲解），乃是他希特拉政府未組織之前最後一次作品，也是他創作史上最高峯，最露骨表現的作品，（事實他以後祗能逃到「伏虎美人」的空想和「唐吉訶德」的古代中去）。因此，我們看他用着最熱烈，最雄偉，最粗壯的手法來完成這一部Ｃｏｍｒａｄｅｓｈｉｐ　　我們看罷，幾乎是每一幅畫面他都是用着「中景」「近景」，壓迫着觀衆的情感，也壓迫着觀衆的呼吸。因着這大畫面的連續，由於他的特有的ｏｎｔａｇｅ之有機的編輯，顯示出他偉大的迫力，不僅是刺㦸你們的視覺，更深深的刺㦸着你的心靈。更加上那複雜而重厚的影響，於是這一影片成爲劃時代的作品了。　　關於這種乎法，在「唐吉訶德」中，我們也可看到一部份的任用，然而正因爲二部影片之内容的差異，於是也用不同的形像表現出來。　　日前刋所載的「巴布斯脫論譯」一文中，曾經提出他作品的重厚情，並且解釋着說：「在他的作品中，却不是無理由的重厚，而是對於内容有着非常深刻的意味，所謂强力的重厚」，這種批判，對於他眞是非常恰當的了。　　關於這種手法，我們在蘇聯的影片中常可發現，因此可以證明，這種魄力的重厚的手法，乃是適宜新型的作品的了。　　由於内容之充分的展露着現實的决定意義，更由於與内容完全一致的形式的强調，於是這一影片成爲僕洛立達黎西特型的作品了。　　其次，他也相當的使用象徴的手法，如撞破牆壁和鐵栅門，更從一人口道出「我們地底下還有什麽國疆之分？」這指出了他的主題了。此外在炭坑大戰的描寫，用簡短的方法成爲法鑛工的回憶，也是最可取的特點。又如開始時在小孩的爭吵中挿入失業工人的找工作，成爲一種横的叙述法，也是値得我們學習的。　　柏勃斯德對於聲片製作那明快的題材手法以至聲響處理，處處都顯示出他對於素材的取捨非常直爽大方，他没有從極小的地方去作無益的顧惜。　　「互助」看過之後，很容易使我回憶數月前在滬公映的「唐吉柯德」這兩片關於聲音材料的取材各有不同之處，前者據於主題是記錄電影，所以處處都應用着現實的素材，毫無假借與擬造。復者是利用着夏理賓那天才的歌喉，處處加上了樂聲，雖然據於這兩點不同之處，我覺得並没有絲毫失去柏勃斯德那獨特的手法，他對於音樂，歌唱的處理，還是跟一切音響的處理一樣，他每一部片中，有了極豐的，素材，他都是一樣地把適當合理的盡量地應用，無益的毫不顧惜地放棄，正和他對於他那畫面上的處理一樣。　　「互助」全片關於聲響的處理上，我們可以分析爲兩個部分去解决牠。前段处劇的開端以至於煤坑的爆發，情節下只是把劇的進行平舖直叙，柏勃斯德也只得極自然的利用那應有的素材。　　劇的轉機是在方淑赴巴黎的車上，火車正在發出那出發的機聲時，突然有炭坑爆發的聲音聯繫着。於是由平行的事件轉入緊漲，製作者於是也盡量地處理那應有的素材，使對於那劇的高潮的展開更加倍的有力。　　當坑工知道了爆發以至於逃避，炭坑崩壞，火災的刹那間，有羣衆的呼救聲，爆裂音，逃避的步履聲等，只在瞬息間，容納了一切應有盡有的素材。以後又回復坑内一向的沉默，除了隱約中聽到些呻吟聲以外。　　工人區域得到了煤坑爆發的消息以後，羣衆的喧嚷也只在瞬息之間，當工人家屬向坑口跑去察問時，那成羣的步履聲，構成極恐怖的情緒，這長時間的奔逃塲面，他把那步履聲，及稀少的人聲以外的音響放棄了，他没有顧惜那對於劇的進展有礙的一切。　　自炭坑内及坑口的反覆塲面，最能够充分的表現柏勃斯德對於音響處理之獨特的手法，外面那羣衆的騒聲，反映着坑内一切的沉默。老礦工跑進炭坑的時候，這沉默之中只有他那凄慘的呌喚聲和涉水聲，重握着觀衆的情緒。始終柏勃斯德是重用着沉默的音響，來構成這個劇的緊漲。　　最後，關於「互助」却有人加以幼稚的誤解，最主要的說「互助」是德國將其聯絡法國感情的，而這樣便是「互助」這種見解，可謂稍具常識者，必定會知道「互助」完全不是希特勒的宣傅品，（詳如上述）正相反，作者因此片而被希特勒所驅逐。爲了觀衆不致被人欺騙，我們得附帶的指出某種影評人之錯誤。電影小說大富之家（ＴｈｅＨｏｕｓｅ　ｏｆ　Ｒｏｔｈｓｃｈｉｌｄ）（八）  印文　「在黑暗之中，爬行了這許久—」南丹突然跳了起來說，「現在居然能够公開的，和别的銀行的銀行家競爭角逐，這可說是生平最痛快的一件事了。公爵，再喝一杯。」他將威靈登的杯子斟滿了說道：「爲承辦不國債劵的銀行家祝壽！」威靈登將杯子舉得高高的喊道：「爲露德蔡的家放祝壽，更爲露德蔡家族中最偉大的份子祝壽。」他向南丹鞠着躬。書房的門開了，珠麗和費兹洛伊携手走了進來。威靈登微笑地對着費茲洛伊說道：「怪不得你在前敵的時候，屢次三番地向我請假，要到倫敦來，說有緊急的事情。我現在才明白。」費茲洛伊看了一看珠麗，然後着向他的上司說道：「將軍，前後亦不過祗有五次。」南丹很狡滑地在一旁說道：「有一次，你派他到倫敦來遞一封公事給首相—珠麗還在唐寗街的轉彎角上等」着他哩。」珠麗看着她父親驚異道：「你怎麽知道的？」威靈登哈哈笑了起來說道「你還想：瞞他嗎？他簡直是個魔術家！」他說完了，好像無可奈何似的向南丹告了别而去了。　　南丹送到門口，等到門丁將門關好了，他格格地笑着道：「他是在戰塲上尋求和平靜悶哩。」然後他看着他的女兒，她正在目送着費兹。她慢慢走到她父親面前，她的母親亦在一旁。珠麗呑呑吐吐地說道：「我—我應當是很快活的，但是我不很快活。」漢娜連忙很憐惜的問她的女兒道：「爲什麽事你不快活呢？」珠麗眼中充滿了眼涙說道：「我—有些害怕。南丹將她拉到自已身邊，柔聲對她說道：「珠麗，我並不虚假，我總想，你還是嫁給一個同種的人好些。」珠麗聲音帶着抖道：「我怕的就是這個。這個種族之見。我們是不能忍受？費茲是不是能忍受？」南丹聽了，自已心中覺得一陣難受。他極想安慰她，驅除她的愁慮。他一定要設法恢復她慣常的歡樂。他低聲地告訴她道：「世界現在已經略爲有些變更了。允其是在英國。我們已經不用再住在猶太人街了。他們漸漸將我們的鐵鏈解除了……或者……」　　珠麗聽了她父親的話，露了些歡容。她囁嚅着說道：「眞的嗎？你說我和費茲可以—」南丹問着他的夫人道：「漢娜，你以爲如何？」漢娜看了她的女兒說道：「我想女子應當讓她們自已有選擇的自由。」南丹若有所思的說道：「珠麗，你是一個露德蔡—威靈登公爵說，我們露德蔡的族人在戰爭之中，已經替歐洲盡了許多力量。試問那年經的費茲洛伊到底有了什麽功勞？恐怕什麽也没有—祇會屢次三番的請假——對於花園的布置，倒很有興趣的！」珠麗笑道：「對於女人，亦頗有專長的。」南丹道：「那亦並没有表示他人格上的力量。無論什麽傻子都會愛上你的！」（未完）</p>

<p>(Washington) Although London claims that the Japanese declaration incident has come to an end, Secretary of State Hull stated today that the United States does not hold this view. When reporters asked about a telegram from London stating that Britain considers Foreign Minister Hirota's explanation satisfactory, Hull only replied, "I have not consulted with Britain on this matter." This may be the first indication that the United States and Britain cannot take joint action regarding Japan's declaration of April 17. However, it is widely rumored that yesterday, during discussions between State Department officials and British Ambassador to the US, Lindsay, that while the opinions of the United States and Britain are not entirely the same, they are largely similar. Hull also stated that the State Department will carefully study the original text of Japan's new Far Eastern policy before deciding on a reply or other actions. Hull reiterated that the government, under no circumstances, considers this matter to be concluded. In conclusion, Hull stated that he has several points that need to be studied in detail before he can determine whether the explanation requested by the United States is satisfactory. Hull is particularly concerned about who can determine which loans or aid to China are detrimental to peace in the Far East. Hull stated that this issue could easily lead to disagreements among countries. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) News from Tokyo says that Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota has sent memoranda to the British and American ambassadors, stating Japan's intention to respect China's territorial integrity and the Open Door Policy. The news was received here with a rather good impression. Secretary of State Hull is unwilling to make a statement on this matter at present, saying only that after receiving all necessary documents, he will conduct a deep study of the Far Eastern situation. As for whether joint action with Britain has been discussed, he has not heard of it. Japanese Ambassador Saitō claims that he has not yet received an official copy of the memorandum that Foreign Minister Hirota delivered to the British and American ambassadors. According to news from London this morning, Britain seems to have expressed satisfaction with the explanation provided by the Japanese Foreign Minister and considers the matter to be "concluded." President Roosevelt is still in constant contact with Secretary of State Hull to study the new situation created by the Japanese declaration in the Far East. This study has not yet been completed, so the attitude that the United States will take has not yet been announced. The future development of the situation will depend on the specific facts. Matters of principle are secondary. (Havas News Agency Telegram, 28th) (Washington) Regarding Japan's declaration on its policy towards China, Secretary of State Hull is unwilling to make any declaration before studying Japan's official documents, and he is unwilling to acknowledge that he has received Japan's official documents. In fact, this week, the American ambassador to Tokyo, Grew, received these documents and has already telegraphed them to the State Department. According to semi-official sources, after Japanese Ambassador to the US Saitō recently issued a statement revising the Japanese Foreign Ministry's statement, the situation has greatly eased, and Japan and Britain seem to believe that this matter has come to an end. However, Washington has decided not to acknowledge that it has concluded. (Havas News Agency Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(London) According to the Sunday Express, Foreign Secretary Simon will state in the House of Commons tomorrow that Japan has announced that it does not want to interfere with the rights and interests of other countries in China and that Japan does not want to take any position that violates the Nine-Power Treaty. (Reuters Telegram, 29th) (London) Foreign Secretary Simon will report to the House of Commons yesterday, Monday, on the situation in China, and will submit to the House of Commons the telegrams between British Ambassador to Japan, Lindley, and Foreign Minister Hirota, and between Hirota and US Ambassador Grew. Furthermore, the Foreign Secretary will reaffirm Britain's adherence to the Nine-Power Treaty so as not to cause Japan to worry. Even if there is any change in the future government of Britain, the British government's policy will not be affected by the declarations of other countries. Foreign Minister Hirota has not disputed this view, and now it is generally believed that further exchanges of memoranda are unnecessary. (China Press Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi, met with Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday at 1:40 PM for about two hours. Foreign Minister Hirota explained the diplomatic policy towards China and the spirit of his harmonious diplomacy and hoped for more effort, roughly saying that now is not the time for quiet observation, but has reached the stage of actively resolving the pending issues between China and Japan. The two sides' opinions were in agreement. The content of their meeting is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) With the aim of establishing friendly relations between neighboring countries, after half a year of hard work, China has realized that its anti-Japanese movement is wrong, and it has also made it aware that unreasonable assistance from other countries is not enough to contribute to China and maintain peace in East Asia. Now, a strong atmosphere of Sino-Japanese cooperation has been brewing in spirit.</p>
<p>(2) China and Japan are related like lips and teeth, so for the sake of maintaining peace in East Asia, there is no other way than direct negotiations between China and Japan.</p>
<p>(3) Initially, efforts should be made to resolve the pending issues in North China, such as traffic, postal services, and customs. Secondly, trade relations should be reorganized. Both of these should be carried out gradually.</p>
<p>(4) In order to increase mutual trust, political and economic rapprochement should be carried out, and cultural exchanges should be conducted at the same time. For example, the active activities of the Department of Cultural Affairs for China are also an effective measure.</p>
<p>(5) All substantive issues in economics and culture must be thoroughly understood, so that a foundation of friendship can be built, and then efforts can be made to solve political problems. In this way, the Sino-Japanese problem can be improved, and East Asian peace can be established, becoming a major pillar for ensuring world peace. (United News of Japan Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Based on the report and important advice of Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi, who returned home, Foreign Minister Hirota, in consultation with the army, navy, and other related parties, ordered Ambassador Ariyoshi to return to his post in three weeks with instructions on the new policy towards China. Considering China's recent attitude towards Japan, the following points have become clear: (1) The pending issues in North China are gradually being shifted to a practical attitude of separate resolution; (2) The fundamental proposition that Japan has a special responsibility in East Asia; Regarding the Chinese government's statement on Japan's policy towards China the day before, there is a practical understanding; (3) The most important point that China is wary of is the worry that Japan will carry out policies such as invading Chinese territory or monopolizing the Chinese market. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota intends to take this opportunity to earnestly explain the true meaning of his policy towards China, so that China can trust that Japan can cooperate to satisfactorily resolve common problems and common interests in East Asia. It is believed that China will be able to understand, so Foreign Minister Hirota's new policy towards China will be gradually realized, Sino-Japanese relations will be able to return to normalcy, and the future of the entire East Asia will be bright.

<p>(New York) Dr. Rajchman, the official connecting the League of Nations and China, met with reporters today and refused to criticize Geneva and London's reports that Japan attacked Rajchman, believing that Rajchman was engaged in political activities, so Rajchman did not want to return to China. Rajchman declared, "All I can tell you is that I have not yet received a notification from Geneva to decide whether I will return to China next week as originally planned. That is all I can say." According to news from Geneva, diplomatic circles believe that Rajchman may not continue to hold this important position after his one-year term expires in mid-July. Diplomats stated that Rajchman's mission is purely limited to technical aspects, but did not express how seriously they are considering Japan's accusations in the reports.

<p>(Washington) The Soviet Russian Ambassador to the US, Troyanovsky, gave a speech somewhere, saying that there are some countries that want to control other countries or conquer them, but do not want to cooperate with them. Troyanovsky then recounted an interesting Russian fable, saying that a cat was stealing a chicken in the kitchen, and was seen by the cook. The cook scolded the cat, talking eloquently, but the cat calmly ate the chicken, without being moved at all. International politics can be compared to this. The current problem is what to do when the cat does not listen to the teaching and continues to steal food. In other words, the issue is international sanctions. In Troyanovsky's view, people have too many extravagant hopes for super-international courts, as can be seen from the experience of the League of Nations and the Hague International Court. The resolution of various international issues depends on the countries themselves, not on super-international forces. Only by concluding extremely clear treaties and signing them legally can international relations have a tolerable basis, and international law will have a reliable basis. (Havas Telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>(London) The British Observer commented again today on Japan's statement regarding the China incident, not allowing other countries to interfere, saying that the governments of Western countries are gradually realizing that Tokyo's statement is contrary to Japan's existing policy. Japan's explanations, even if they are still friendly, lack substantial guarantees. In other words, Japan is disregarding the other seven countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty, demanding to exclusively dominate the 400 million Chinese people, and has made comments wanting naval equality with Britain and the United States. Not only that, according to a certain Japanese newspaper, Japan also wants to protest against the Singapore base, believing that it endangers Japan. This kind of arrogant behavior is evidence of Japan's unwisdom. Its immediate result has been President Roosevelt's initiation of naval construction, and people in London are also convinced that the spirit of the documents and speeches published in Tokyo is now raising the issue of the Nine-Power Treaty. Because Japan's demand for unilateral action and its self-proclaimed responsibility to maintain peace and order in the Far East are in conflict with the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. In terms of loans and armaments, people in London admit that Japan also has the right to negotiate before taking steps that may cause disputes, which is no different from the other seven countries, but the British government can never recognize Japan's demand for a "special status." If each country talks about its special interests in China, then the one with the strongest reason to demand it is Britain, because most of the Chinese economy and financial life depends on British capital.

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's proposal on diplomatic issues will be reviewed at a meeting on the 2nd. It is reported that the proposal will be divided into two major stages: short-term and long-term solutions. Xiao Shuyu's four proposals will be included in the long-term aspect, and Liu Guantun's three proposals will be included in the short-term aspect. The opinions of various committee members will be combined to discuss the conclusion, which will be submitted to the general meeting for discussion and then submitted to the central government for reference by the diplomatic authorities. (Special Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu E'qing, Liu Guantun, Zhang Weihan, and others met on the 29th to discuss how to respond to Japan's arrogant statement. As a result, it was decided to draft a declaration to announce at home and abroad, with the general idea expressing that the Chinese people are upholding international conventions, maintaining national integrity, and resolutely opposing Japan's expression. For the sake of maintaining the convention, they will not avoid any difficulties and hope that the signatory countries will rise up together to quell the budding international chaos. The original text will be published after it is finished. (Special Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Legislative Member Liu Guantun was elected as a member of the review committee for the diplomatic issues proposal. It is said that recent diplomatic responses are extremely difficult. The most urgent thing for long-term solutions is to cultivate national strength, while short-term solutions should consider the international situation and promote the joint fulfillment of responsibilities by the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, and impose sanctions on Japan, which has overstepped its boundaries. If we imitate Goujian, then Japan is not Fucha of that year, and revenge is not something that can be achieved overnight. Weighing the pros and cons, and assessing the situation, today's China is in the international arena. There are international conventions, although their effectiveness remains to be proven, but we must not be disappointed because their effectiveness has not been seen. The Nine-Power Treaty was signed in Washington on February 6, 1922. At the time of signing, the enthusiasm of the countries did not diminish despite the fact that the treaty only had nine articles. The United States, as the initiating country, firmly believes in peace. The first article of the treaty clearly stipulates the protection of the sovereignty and integrity of countries. Japan is also a signatory country, and now openly violates it. China should announce to all countries that they should jointly fulfill the responsibility of protecting the sacred treaty. Otherwise, once this precedent is set, what credibility will there be for international treaties? The US government and the signatory countries must have considered this. China's self-improvement is necessary, but the signatory countries also have their due obligation to maintain the treaty. In short, the Nine-Power Treaty must be a heavy blow to Japan.

<p>(Nanjing) It is rumored that I will ask the US to convene a meeting of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to sanction Japan for violating the treaty. According to a certain member of the diplomatic community, when the Liaoning incident occurred, our country advocated immediately convening a Nine-Power conference. At that time, in Nanjing, the ministers or representatives of the US, Britain, France, and other countries were informed of our will. The replies from the ministers after consulting their governments said that the Sino-Japanese issue was currently being discussed by the League of Nations, and the Nine-Power conference could be postponed. Although the intention was to delay, there was still a reason. This time, Japan's statement is acting as the sole protector of East Asia. Our diplomatic authorities believe that whether the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty can be maintained will be the touchstone. Nanjing has no current progress, and it is the foreign ministers who are informally stating the advantages and disadvantages to the governments where they are stationed. On the one hand, we hope that the US authorities will not abandon the major responsibility of convening a conference. After the will of each country is completely clear, convening the conference is also expected. (Special Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e11">New Understanding of Japan's Strengthening of Military Preparations - Zhen <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Since Army Minister Hayashi Senjuro resumed his post, the Japanese military has become increasingly inclined towards a tough policy externally. Internally, it is striving to create a tense atmosphere of an extraordinary period. Although domestic obstacles are rampant and crises are accumulating, it is intensifying its efforts to develop an aggressive policy. Recently, Japanese newspapers reported that major responsible personnel of the military and even middle and lower-ranking officers will undergo major changes. The trend is to thoroughly create a monochrome situation of the pro-war hardliners of the Araki faction and the semi-Araki faction. This trend will affect Japan domestically, causing the fading parliamentary constitutional politics to come to an end. The powerful Zaibatsu will not only be unable to compete with the warlords, but will also be reduced to their lackeys. What will affect peace in the Far East will be to make the balance of power in the Pacific Ocean feel unprecedented threats, and the move to monopolize China will become even more radical. We carefully recognize the existing facts and should know that the Japanese military's deployment of the Nagoya 3rd Division, which has a large number of special corps, along the Middle East Railway line, and the deployment of the Kyoto 16th Division in the Rehe area, are not accidental deployments, but contain extremely important international significance. The informal statement issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 17 is even more closely related. We must not be deceived by a temporary diplomatic smokescreen. Not only that, but Japan has recently been advocating naval equality between Britain, the United States, and Japan, wanting to exchange other rights with Britain and the United States for naval ratios. If the exchange is unsuccessful, it may act alone, breaking the balance of power in the Pacific Ocean in order to increase its hegemony to control East Asia. This is also something that can be inferred. Therefore, the ominous winds in the Pacific Ocean have not diminished at all, and the talk of a Japanese-American war and a Japanese-Soviet war still resonate in the ears of the world. However, according to the current situation to predict the future, there are many contradictions in the national policies of Japan and the United States, but economic relations can still be coordinated. Moreover, the Pacific Ocean is vast, with more than five thousand miles. Long-distance expeditions against any strong enemy are difficult for either side to win. These two points alone are enough to determine that a Japanese-American war will not be realized in the short term.</p>
<p>As for Japanese-Soviet relations, they are very different from Japanese-American relations. The conflict of interests between Japan and the Soviet Union in North Manchuria is becoming increasingly acute, with little room for easing. Even if the sale of the Middle East Railway is successful and the North Sea fisheries are temporarily resolved, the fundamental interests of the two countries are still contradictory. Even if they can turn around temporarily, it is difficult to reconcile permanently. Now both countries are mobilizing heavy troops and increasing their military power, as if a war crisis is imminent. In fact, the Soviet Union is now eagerly engaged in the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan and will never easily provoke foreign countries in order to damage its national strength. Japan harbors the ambition to invade other countries. How can it not want to choose the fat and devour it? However, due to the improper arrangements, it is only making excessive sacrifices and pursuing unattainable desires. It should also have some scruples. Because with Japan's current military strength, occupying Siberia may not be very difficult, but the Soviet Union will certainly not beg for peace because of this. It is bound to rely on its powerful army, navy, and air force as the vanguard and its rich resources as the backing to fight for the final victory with Japan, which is also what Japan dares not risk in a rash attempt. Therefore, a Japanese-Soviet war may not break out in the short term. However, this does not mean that the disaster of the Russo-Japanese war can be avoided. In the future, the challenge will begin from Japan, not from Russia. When Japan has properly placed its right in North China, it will be the time when the Second Russo-Japanese War comes. Looking at the Japanese army's recent stationing of two divisions of heavy troops on the Rehe border, and its dispatch of cadres to scout everywhere, ostensibly traveling, but actually observing the terrain, and rushing to build the Rehe Railway day and night, what is its intention? Anyone knows that it is spying on our China. Spying on North China is to deal with the Soviet Union. Then its eagerness to strengthen its military preparations has a great relationship with us. Shouldn't we rise up quickly and prepare a response?</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Australian Friendship Delegation arrived in Beijing on the 29th morning. Lin Tongshi, the head of the External Affairs Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, represented the Ministry to welcome them at the station. The British Consul-General Bolt, Vice-Consul Prass, and several reporters also came to greet them. The leader of the delegation, Australian Federal Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Industry Latham, along with advisor Reid and a party of seven, were introduced one by one by Consul-General Bolt, who also explained in detail the reception procedures from all sectors of the capital. In response to the press, Latham gave a 15-minute speech: 1. Our government has always maintained friendly relations with countries on the Pacific Rim. This visit aims to have good meetings with government officials from various countries, promote friendship, and also conduct a brief investigation into the economic situation of various governments to seek mutually beneficial ways. In short, our visit here has no special mission and is mainly for sightseeing purposes. 2. The Far Eastern situation is a problem for China, and China should seek its own solutions. Our delegation and our government have no other opinions to offer except to pray for peace. 3. The establishment of commercial liaison officers in the Far East is still under consideration, and it is difficult to predict when it will be realized. If it is realized, Shanghai would be the most suitable location. Our delegation has just arrived in your country and the time is very short. We will stay for a few more days and visit a few more places, and perhaps then we will have some thoughts to share. It is heard that before coming to China, the delegation had already visited the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, and other places. They will depart for Peiping on the first of next month, stay for a few days, and then go to Japan before returning to Hong Kong. If time permits, they will visit Guangzhou before heading back to Australia. At 1:00 PM, the press circles of the capital hosted a luncheon at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, with Shao Yuanchong, Luo Jialun, Fang Zhi, and Peng Gezhen accompanying them. Jin Chengfu served as the temporary chairman and delivered a welcome speech. Latham and others responded separately. At 4:00 PM, accompanied by British Consul-General Bolt, they visited President Wang at the Ministry of Railways' official residence. At 7:00 PM, they attended a dinner hosted by the municipal government. At noon on the 30th, they will meet with Chairman Lin at the National Government, followed by a luncheon at the British Consulate. At 3:30 PM, they will visit the mausoleum and tour scenic spots along the way. At 8:00 PM, they will attend a dinner hosted by President Wang. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Australian Federal Deputy Prime Minister Latham, along with advisor Reid, intelligence officer and private secretary Standish, assistant secretary Ferguson, and press representative Mulay Carter, a party of seven, arrived in Beijing at 7:00 AM on the 29th, aboard a special carriage attached to the Beijing-Shanghai express train. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent the head of the Liaison Section, Lin Tongshi, and others to welcome them at Xiaguan Railway Station. The British Consul-General in Beijing, Bolt, and Vice-Consul Prass also came to greet them at the station. After Latham's train arrived, the welcoming party boarded the train one after another, where British Consul-General Bolt introduced them and reported the reception schedule set by our government. After a brief conversation between Latham and the greeters, they disembarked and walked out of the station together. Latham and his entourage were taken to the Donglong Hotel, specially prepared by our government, in cars provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to rest. At 1:00 PM, they attended a welcome banquet hosted by the capital's press circles at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center. At 4:00 PM, the British Consul accompanied Latham to the Ministry of Railways, Residence No. 1, to meet President Wang. At 8:00 PM, the Beijing Municipal Government hosted a banquet to entertain them. According to what Latham told reporters, Australia is located in the Far East and is adjacent to China. This visit to China is solely for the purpose of strengthening Sino-Australian friendship and has no special mission. He expressed his gratitude for the hospitality shown by the Chinese government upon their arrival. Subsequently, reporters inquired whether the Australian Federal Government would soon send commercial representatives to be stationed in various countries in the Far East. Latham replied that such a plan indeed existed, but the personnel to be dispatched and the location of their stations were still under detailed consideration by the government. He believed that Shanghai was an important market in the Far East and that it seemed necessary to send personnel for liaison. Reporters also inquired about his impressions after arriving in China. Latham stated that he had only been in China for a few days and that he still needed to conduct a detailed investigation into various situations, so he had no opinion to express at the moment. He concluded by saying that he would stay in Beijing for about two or three days before going to Peiping, and then return to Shanghai to go to Japan for inspection. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing press circles hosted a banquet at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center at 1:00 PM on the 29th to welcome Australian Deputy Prime Minister Latham and his entourage, and invited British Consul Bolt in Beijing and personnel from the Central Propaganda Department to accompany them. Those present included Latham and his advisor Reid, secretaries Standish and Ferguson, intelligence officer Moore, Australian press representative Mulay Carter, British Consul Bolt in Beijing, Director Shao Yuanchong and Deputy Director Luo Jialun of the Central Propaganda Department, Secretary Fang Zhi, Head of the Press Section Peng Gezhen, and representatives from the capital's press circles, totaling more than 30 people. After everyone was seated, they began the Chinese lunch. Latham and others were using chopsticks for the first time, so they found it quite novel. Subsequently, Jin Chengfu, a reporter from the Central Daily News, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the group, stating that Director-General Latham and his entourage, personnel and Australian press representatives had traveled across the ocean to inspect China, and that all those present were extremely pleased with this spirit of friendship. In recent years, the lack of genuine friendship among countries in the Far East had led to the unfortunate incident of the four northeastern provinces of China. The Chinese nation has always loved peace and has always treated friendly countries with a sincere spirit of friendship. He hoped that everyone would convey this message to the people of Australia upon their return, and especially hoped that Australian press representatives would promote the friendship between the Chinese and Australian people through their writings. British Consul Bolt then introduced Latham to the guests, saying that Latham was the Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Industry. Latham then stood up to give a speech, briefly saying that he was deeply grateful for the hospitality. He said that he had come from a newly emerging country to the country with the oldest history in the world. After arriving in China, he had seen that all kinds of construction were modernized and everything had a new look. Although the Australian Federation had close political ties with Great Britain, it was located on the Pacific coast and therefore had extremely close economic ties with the countries of the Far East. Therefore, it was necessary to cultivate friendship. He said this visit was purely for the purpose of promoting friendship and that he would definitely report the situation in your country to the Australian people upon his return. Finally, the Australian press representative gave a speech, thanking the capital's press circles for their hospitality. It was not until 4:00 PM that everyone dispersed in a joyful mood.

<p>(Nanjing) Latham visited the Ministry of Railways official residence to meet Wang, who is also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, at 4:00 PM on the 29th.

At 7:00 PM in the evening, Shi Ying hosted a banquet at the municipal government to entertain Latham and his entourage, and invited Wang, Wang Shijie, Luo Wengan, Zhu Jiahua, and the British Consul in Beijing to accompany them.

<p>(Peiping) Recently, due to poor business at the Peiping Stamp Tax Bureau, the salaries of employees have been in arrears for two months. All employees recently demanded their salaries from Director Shen Nengyi, which led to an incident in which clerk Wen Ruonong was beaten by a guard. The employees even went on strike for a while. Shen then raised 20,000 yuan on the 25th to temporarily pay one month's back wages. In addition to their wages, employees only received 25% of their salary for the first half of March, so some are still on strike in an invisible way. After being beaten, Wen was admitted to Xiehe Hospital for treatment and was only discharged yesterday. According to Wen, he has decided to sue Shen in court.

<p>(Vienna) The government issued a bulletin announcing the contents of the new constitution. The main points are summarized as follows: The preamble of the constitution states, "Almighty God, as the source of all rights, in His name, the Austrian nation accepts this constitution, so that a vocational group political system can be established in the federal state of the Christian German race. The federation is based on provinces." The so-called vocational group federation includes Vienna and various provinces. In the future, federal citizenship will take first place. All citizens are equal under the law, and all privileges obtained from family or class are abolished. Women should enjoy equal rights and obligations with men in society. Individual freedom is protected by the constitution and cannot be restricted by national power without legal basis. However, for the sake of maintaining order and morality, a censorship system can be established for publications. Citizens' freedom of religion and belief is also guaranteed. Citizens' right to hold public office is not distinguished by religion, except for schools. The president is elected by an electoral college composed of 4,700 mayors from across the country. The mayor of Vienna serves as the chairman of this electoral college. Citizens must be 35 years of age to be eligible for election as president. The government can hold referendums, and all citizens over the age of 24 can participate. The time when the new constitution and various temporary provisions will be implemented and take effect will be stipulated by special laws with constitutional status. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

(2) In case of emergency, the government has the right to issue orders that act as laws. Under certain conditions, the President may also have the power to take orders that change the Constitution. (3) The new constitution establishes the Federal Council, the Federal Upper House, the Council of Advisers, the National Economic Council, and the Economic Councils of each province. Mr. Ender also explained the operation of each council. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

In order to make it easier for people to attend the lecture, farmers can take the bus to the city to listen to the lecture for free, but they must be checked upon arrival. Dr. Ender, a key official of the Austrian government, announced the contents of the new Austrian constitution to reporters today. The constitution stipulates that in the event of government failure, the Federal Executive Council may handle government affairs on behalf of the government. The government has the right to declare martial law in an emergency. The word "Republic" is removed from the official name of the country. It is expected that the new constitution no longer contains provisions suppressing the Habsburg royal family. The Austrian Parliament has not met for fourteen months, and will now meet for one day on April 30 to pass the new group constitution and announce the dissolution of the parliament. May 1 is the day to announce the constitution. Celebrations will be held on this day to celebrate the birth of the new Austria. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e74">Telegram <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Addressed to all newspaper offices in Guangzhou: Since the founding of the Republic of China, the aggression and oppression of China by Japanese imperialism have become increasingly serious. Not content with seizing our Northeast and burning our Shanghai, they have recently intensified their ambition with the "Eleven Articles." On the 17th of this month, they issued an informal statement, resolutely opposing international assistance to China, opposing the great powers supplying China with military aircraft, military instructors, and political loans, etc. On the 18th, they made an even stronger statement, saying that if international cooperation assists China, Japan will take active action to oppose it, even resorting to force if necessary. Examining the historical facts of Japanese aggression against China, the informal statement issued this time is something that the people of the country and the international community should pay attention to: (1) Restraining China from developing relations with foreign countries, hoping to make China a protectorate of Japan; (2) Wanting to implement an economic blockade of China, opposing foreign equipment loans and other assistance to China, which is equivalent to Chapter 5 of the "Twenty-One Demands"; (3) Stating that it interferes with China's internal affairs and hinders China's independence and prosperity; (4) Provoking the international community and disrupting China's technical cooperation; (5) Destroying international law and the Nine-Power Treaty, hoping to disturb the peace of East Asia and the world; (6) Hoping to conquer China and then conquer all of Asia. China is a member of the League of Nations, and promoting international cooperation and promoting international peace is an inherent obligation. For the sake of maintaining the security of our country and the peace of the Far East, purchasing airplanes and hiring military experts are also legitimate acts of national defense. The Japanese imperialists suddenly made unreasonable opposition, and their ambition to annex China and annex all of Asia is obvious. Anyone with blood and courage can hardly acquiesce to this. This kind of unreasonable expression not only insults China but also oppresses the international community. This is what our compatriots across the country and friendly countries in the world should jointly oppose in order to maintain peace in the Far East. The telegram is filled with grief and indignation. I hope you will understand. The Guangdong Provincial Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Guangzhou Special City Executive and Supervisory Committee, has the seal.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Strange Ships Shelling at Gao Po Kou, Changshu <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Grey warships shelled the shore.</p>
<p>Shells were about a foot long and had Chinese characters on them.</p>
<p>Residents along the river were terrified when they heard the alarm.</p>
<p>The county government has reported the situation to the provincial government.</p>
<p>Changshu dispatch: The towns of Lao Wu Shi, Hu Pu, and Xu Liu Jing along the river in our county suddenly heard loud gunshots around 2:00 PM on the 27th, interspersed with machine gun fire, coming from the river. The sound shook the roofs. This continued for about half an hour. The residents were extremely frightened. At this time, the fish market in Hu Pu Town was in full swing. After hearing the alarm, the residents rushed to take shelter. After the sound of artillery fire stopped, the security team of the town and the police of the Wu Shi Police Station and the Public Security Bureau went to the river to investigate. According to reports from fishermen in Gao Po Kou, they saw two gray warships with four smokestacks in the river, traveling between Gao Po Kou and Ye Mao Kou. When shelling, they were anchored outside the mouth. Observing the purpose of the artillery fire, it seemed to be aimed at the old mouse sand, with the prows and sterns of the ships marked with the red sun flag. When the shells flew through the air, we all crawled in the fields, not daring to move, etc. The police team further investigated along the river and discovered three shells, one at Yan Bu Bridge, one at Tang Jia Oil Mill, and one in front of the Land Temple. The shells had exploded and penetrated deep into the mud, in a spiral shape. Two shells did not explode. After the police team picked them up, they took them back to Lao Wu Town. Zhao Jinbiao, the squad leader of the police team, was about to prepare a report and submit it to the headquarters when, at 7:50, the sound of artillery fire suddenly rang again. However, because the river was as dark as ink, the location of the shooting was unknown. Fortunately, the shells fell in a place that only damaged crops and did not hurt people. Now, after receiving the report, the authorities have reported to the provincial government on the one hand and sent people to the countryside to investigate.</p>
<p>Continued dispatch: The two shells recovered by the police team were personally escorted to the headquarters of the brigade by Shen Guocai, a special agent of the Second Brigade, on the morning of the 28th. Upon hearing the news, the reporter went to the brigade to visit and saw that the shells were about a foot long and about three inches in diameter. One was engraved with the two Chinese characters of size No. 2 "Wu" and a "△" symbol. The other was engraved with the Chinese character "Ke". According to the captain of the brigade, this is a 75mm small steel artillery shell. As for the rumors that it was engraved with the words "Taisho 38," it is completely unfounded. Wang Kunshan, the captain of the team, also said that this morning (28th), he also received a telegram from Commander Ji of the Zhenyu patrol ship stationed in Hu Pu, saying that the artillery fire yesterday was heard to be the Navy Survey Bureau shooting at the beach sand, which is often heard along the river. Now, it has been presented to the county government along with the shells, requesting to be forwarded to the provincial government for investigation. If it is indeed a ship of the Survey Bureau, please notify them not to shoot here again to avoid panic among the residents. According to the news from the county government in the evening, it has been reported to the provincial government.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, the reporter went to the brigade headquarters again and visited Shen Guocai, a special agent of the Second Brigade stationed in the countryside, who was on the scene. According to him, at 2:00 PM that afternoon, he suddenly heard the sound of machine guns, as dense as a string of pearls, coming from the river to the northeast. Then he heard the rumbling of artillery fire, continuously. The roofs were shaken. He was ordered to lead seven brothers and traveled five miles to investigate along the river. The sound of artillery fire had not stopped and only ceased at 4:10. However, at that time, there was a heavy fog in the river, and the ship was far away in the river six or seven miles, making it impossible to identify which country's warship it was. However, the fishermen in the area claimed that the ship had the red sun flag marked on it, which seemed to be a warship of a certain country, but illiterate fishermen could not be used as testimony. As for Commander Ji of the Zhenyu patrol ship, who said that it was heard that the Navy Survey Bureau was shooting at the beach sand, which is often heard along the river, then why did they fire machine guns for about half an hour first? In short, at this time when the situation in North China is tense and rumors are rampant, a warship of a certain country suddenly fired guns and artillery in the inner river beach, which seems to be an unavoidable thing. The most strange thing is that it is not surprising to shoot in the daytime, but it actually opened fire again at 7:30 in the evening, which really makes it difficult for the residents along the river to sleep peacefully, etc. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Battle Record of Yunmenling <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong troops advanced by stepping over corpses</p>
<p>The Red Capital Ruijin was extremely panic-stricken</p>
<p>Shantou dispatch: Yunmenling is located at the border of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces, and is a vital transportation hub for the three provinces. It is also the highest mountain range on the Fujian-Guangdong border. The Red Army has been entrenched there for five years, serving as a barrier to the Red Capital of Ruijin and forming a strategic alliance with the bandit area of Changting. Since the Eastern Route Army advanced to Huilong in Shanghang, the defense on the Fujian-Guangdong border has been consolidated. The Guangdong army has no worries about advancing on the ridge, so they were able to transfer the Huang Renhuan division of Wuping to make a side attack on Luotang from the side of Guikeng Dongliu. Luotang is a market town at the foot of the south mountain of Yunmenling and is the only way for the Guangdong army to attack Yunmenling. In the middle of this month, the Second Column of the Guangdong Army, led by Li Yangjing, attacked the front of the ridge. First, the Huang Yanzhen division occupied Chengjiangxu, and then the Huang Zhiwen division occupied Pangu Pass. At the same time, the Li Zhenliang division was transferred to Xunwu as the general reserve team. After Pangu Pass was captured, the Guangdong army divided into three routes to attack Luotang Shiluo Intersection. After a fierce battle for a day and a night, the bandits used fortresses and natural mountain terrain to fight. The Guangdong army used the power of airplanes to bomb the bandits' fortresses. The three regiments of Li Hengzhong, Wu Hanping, and Chen Shaowu of Huang Renhuan's division recaptured Luotang from the Fujian border on the 11th. After Luotang was obtained, a general offensive was immediately launched. The air force flew from Meixian every day, bombing the defensive works of the bandits in Yunmenling Houjiangkou and other places. Jiangkou is located on the bank of the Zhangshui River, between Huichang and Yunmenxu. The First Column, Li Zhenqiu's division, sent Li Zhen's regiment to advance from An Yuanzhongshi to Zhangshui, threatening the bandits' backs. At that time, the Red bandits under the ridge were still firmly holding the dangerous passes, trying to make a trapped beast. The area was originally the third war zone of the Red Army. The commander, Ye Jianying, led more than 10,000 people from the pseudo 22nd Division, the Model Division, and the Student Independent Regiment, with more than 7,000 guns. Li Yangjing inspected the front line on the 18th before the general offensive with Chief of Staff Ouyang Xin and more than 20 senior officers. On the 20th, he returned to Pingyuan and decided on a plan with the division commanders, and then ordered a general offensive. At dawn on the 21st, Huang Yanzhen led the three regiments of Ye Gang, Lian Tisheng, and Huang Shitu to attack from the front of Yangjiao Ridge. Tan Langxing led the regiments of Deng Hui and others to search the Zhucun area. The Huang Zhiwen division divided its forces from Pangu Pass to serve as the left wing, and the Huang Renhuan division moved out of Luotang to serve as the right wing. They first made contact in Zhucun and fought for an hour. A great war broke out at Yangjiao Ridge, Fenghuangdong, Huangshadong, and other places. The two sides engaged in melee charges more than 20 times. By noon, the victory or defeat had not been determined. The Guangdong army used more than 50 mountain guns to concentrate firepower and launch a brigade-level charge. Air Force Wu Wenjian and Ao Yuanqing led five aircraft in rotation to bomb the bandit's front line, destroying more than 20 of the bandit's fortresses. The Guangdong army advanced by stepping over corpses. At that time, the bandits suffered 700-800 casualties. The bandits' high mountain fortresses were completely destroyed, so they fled towards Qingxi and towards the Fujian border. The Lian Tisheng regiment occupied Yunmenling at dusk. The communists in the north of the ridge and the Zhangshui area are still densely plotting a counterattack. The Guangdong army is now adding heavy troops to the front. Ruijin, the Red Capital, has lost its southwestern barrier and is in great panic. The Shantou City Party Headquarters recently initiated a condolence team for the soldiers fighting the communists and is preparing to raise supplies and send representatives to the Jiangxi border to offer condolences.

<h3 id="e77">Ministry of Finance Reduces Surtaxes on Land Tax; Reorganizes Land Tax and Conducts Land Reporting; To Be Implemented After Discussion at the Financial Conference <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi stated that in recent years, the surtaxes on land taxes in various provinces of our country have generally exceeded the principal tax, except for a few provinces that have no surtaxes. What used to be a burden on merchants due to likin has now turned into a burden on farmers due to surtaxes. In order to save the bankrupt rural economy, he proposed to the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang to reorganize land tax, reduce surtaxes, and first conduct land reporting. The General Assembly passed the principle and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Executive Yuan has now passed it and ordered the Ministry of Finance to be responsible for handling it. Now it is known that the Ministry of Finance has drafted the methods and implementation guidelines for reorganizing land tax, reducing surtaxes, and conducting land reporting. After it is submitted to the National Financial Conference for discussion again, it can be implemented within a limited time. The methods are excerpted as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Reducing Surtaxes on Land Tax <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The outline of the methods for reducing surtaxes on land tax is as follows: (A) Determining local financial budgets, all regular and temporary income and expenditure in the entire county, regardless of whether they are collected and paid by county government agencies or district and township offices, shall be listed in the budget. After the county reviews it, it shall be reported to the provincial government for strict review. (B) The provincial government shall review the county's local budget and carefully assess whether each item of surtax on land tax is needed, distinguish between urgency, and whether it should be borne by the local government. If the county's business expenses approved to be included in the budget are insufficient due to restrictions on surtaxes, in addition to using land reporting and increased taxes on urban land without grain to offset them, the provincial government may allocate funds to subsidize them. If the provincial budget is insufficient, it may be reported to the central government for verification and special approval for coordination. (C) All local financial income and expenditure in the county, whether county funds or district funds, shall be uniformly reviewed and announced separately by the county financial authority, and all legal entities shall be allowed to audit the accounts at any time. (D) After the budget is reviewed and announced, any income or expenditure outside the budget shall be dealt with strictly in accordance with the provincial punishment regulations unless approved by the provincial government in advance on a special project. The above methods are to enable the county to have a definite budget, to prevent indiscriminate apportionment and abuse, so that surtaxes can be reduced in practice, to relieve the people of pain, that is, to save the countryside and curb chaos.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Conducting Land Reporting <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>To reorganize land tax, land reporting shall be conducted first. The outline of the methods is as follows: (1) Within the borders of each province, all public and private land, mountains, and ponds, etc., except for roads, rivers, and city walls, shall be reported in accordance with these methods, so that the government can compile and send tax registers and revise taxes. (2) Each province shall conduct land reporting in accordance with these methods and refer to local conditions to formulate implementation plans and all regulations and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval. (3) Each provincial government shall designate the finance department or the civil affairs department as the competent authority to supervise the county governments to establish offices, handle them by township, town, and region by the township and town offices, or divide the area by the county and assign other personnel to handle them. The provincial and county governments shall select local fair people and representatives of legal entities to form provincial and county land clearing committees to assist the government, persuade the people, and handle land reporting. The central government shall send personnel to each province at any time to inspect and urge reporting matters. (4) The land tax increased by each county after reporting shall be retained to fill local expenses and used to offset surtaxes. (5) Those who have land without grain, or grain without land, and those whose grain and land do not match, shall be allowed to be raised, removed, and never pursued retroactively after reporting. (6) Land reporting shall be divided into: 1. Compilation and investigation, 2. Reporting and announcement, 3. Registration and issuance of certificates, 4. Revision of taxes and grain amounts. (7) Land reporting shall be reported in separate forms according to the section and block, and the following items shall be reported: 1. True name and address of the owner, 2. Name and address of the tenant or other user, 3. Title deeds and other witnesses, 4. Location of the land (county, map, or village) and small place names, 5. Land area and boundaries, 6. Types of land (such as fields, ponds, etc.), 7. Value per acre of land. (8) After the river land reporting announcement, the original documents shall be verified and a land reporting certificate shall be issued. All transfers, mortgages, and inheritances shall be valid with the reporting certificate in the future. (9) Land reporting shall not charge handling fees, and the reporting form and reporting certificate shall be exempt from stamp duty. (10) The expenses required for land reporting shall be used for certificate fees, and at the time of commencement, they shall be supplemented or borrowed with other public funds from the province and county, and the newly added land tax after reporting shall be returned first. (11) Each county shall refer to the old capital's original taxes and separately determine new taxes for fields, land, mountains, and ponds, and calculate the grain amount on the land reporting certificate, and issue grain on the spot. (12) Those who report on time</p>

<p>Litigation Between Grandfather, Father, and Son: Three Generations of Estrangement Lead to Property Dispute. Rong Shangqian Sued by Eldest Son Rong Peng and Two Grandsons.</p>
<p>Rong Shangqian, a 78-year-old Guangdong native residing at No. 114 Jing'an Villa, and his wife Yu Xueling had two sons: Rong Peng, the eldest, now 46, and Rong Hong. Rong Peng has two sons, Gui Sheng and Bing Kun, aged 13 and 11 respectively. The father and sons all live at No. 493 Dexing Lane, Peng Road, Hongkou. They are not close to their grandfather Rong Shangqian, who, despite possessing millions in family assets, treats his descendants like strangers. Now, Rong Peng and his sons have engaged lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai to file a lawsuit against Rong Shangqian for division of property. They claim that when their mother Yu Xueling married the defendant, she brought a dowry worth over 400,000 yuan. Through her lifetime of management, this sum grew to over 2 million yuan. Upon her death in March of the 18th year of the Republic, she left behind the following assets: (1) 200 shares of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation stock, valued at 2,000 yuan per share, totaling 400,000 yuan; (2) a deposit of 380,000 taels of silver in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; (3) a deposit of 140,000 yuan in the Shanghai branch of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; (4) 27,200 shares of American-Chinese Industrial Corporation stock, valued at 15.5 taels of silver per share, totaling 421,600 taels; (5) a Hong Kong building valued at 600,000 Hong Kong dollars; (6) a market building on Sha Ji Avenue in Guangzhou; (7) five market buildings in Zhou Tou Zui, Henan; (8) a large Western-style house with a garden on Baochang Road, Zhabei, Shanghai, valued at 100,000 yuan. All eight properties were in Yu Xueling’s name. Since the defendant took control, he has disposed of them at will, even withholding 10,000 shares of American-Chinese Industrial Corporation stock that Yu had allocated to her grandsons Gui Sheng and Bing Kun before her death, and transferring them into his own name. Feeling aggrieved, they were compelled to file a lawsuit, requesting the court to order the defendant to hand over the 10,000 shares of American-Chinese Industrial Corporation stock to Gui Sheng and Bing Kun, and to divide the remaining assets into three shares, with Rong Peng receiving one share, valued at 700,000 yuan. The plaintiffs further stated that the subject of the lawsuit, including the value of 10,000 shares, totaled over 916,000 yuan, requiring a first-instance litigation fee of over 4,180 yuan. As they are currently struggling to maintain their livelihood, they have no means to pay this large sum. Therefore, they specifically requested assistance to be temporarily exempted from payment, which was approved by the First Special District Court after investigation confirmed their inability to pay. The afternoon before yesterday, Judge Shen opened the court to summon both parties for interrogation. It is rare to see a grandfather, father, and son litigating in court. Judge Shen inquired about the types and amounts of disputed assets, and after both sides' lawyers debated, he instructed the plaintiffs and defendants to await judgment.</p>
<p>The Zhenchang Ship Collides with and Sinks the Jiang'an Ferry in the Huangpu River; All Those Who Fell into the Water Were Fortunately Rescued.</p>
<p>The Jiang'an, a small steamship belonging to the Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochangmiao, was returning to Gaochangmiao from the Dongjiadu Wharf in Nanshi around 3 p.m. on the 28th. As it was leaving the wharf, the freighter Zhenchang was traveling south to north at high speed. The Jiang'an ferry, noticing the Zhenchang approaching head-on, quickly signaled to avoid a collision, but due to the rapid tidal currents and the Zhenchang's speed, it was unable to stop in time. The Zhenchang struck the Jiang'an, creating a large hole in its hull. Water immediately rushed in, and the ferry began to sink. The boatmen and crew of the Jiang'an attempted to escape, but it was too late, and they all fell into the Huangpu River. Upon learning of the incident, the water patrol team, led by Deputy Captain Li Chenghua, dispatched officers to the scene. Nearby sampans had already begun rescuing the crew who had fallen into the water. Deputy Captain Li supervised the officers in assisting with the rescue, and fortunately, all the crew members were saved without any drownings. The captain of the Zhenchang, Zhu Liangxi, was taken into custody by Deputy Captain Li for questioning. The Jiangnan Shipyard was notified to arrange for the salvage of the sunken Jiang'an ferry. Since the damage was not extensive, the ferry could be repaired and put back into service after being salvaged.</p>
<p>Chen Jiancheng Appeals Against Sister Chen Chunan for Property Encroachment; Appeal Based on Four Points; Seeks Division of 2 Million Yuan Estate</p>
<p>Chen Chunan, a Teochew native over fifty years old, resides at No. 16 Zhilan Lane, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Her father, Chen Qiyun, had established Chen Hefeng Native Produce Firm in Shanghai, amassing a fortune. Last year, Chen Jiancheng, her nephew, sued Chen Chunan in the Second Special Court for encroaching on the family estate, seeking a quarter of the estate, totaling 2 million yuan. After several months of litigation, Chen Chunan was acquitted. However, Chen Jiancheng declared his dissatisfaction and engaged lawyers Wang Peiyuan to file an appeal, which was accepted by the Third Branch of the High Court. The afternoon before yesterday, Judge Li Changnian convened a hearing in the Second Court. Chen Jiancheng stated that his appeal was based on three points: First, the Chen Hefeng Native Produce Firm was indeed established by his ancestor in partnership with others. Second, his ancestor had left a will stating that the estate had not been divided. Third, although a family division agreement was drafted, his ancestor had not signed it, nor had many other relevant parties. Therefore, the agreement was not valid, and since the Shanghai property was not mentioned in the agreement, it was entirely encroached upon by his great-uncle (i.e., Chen Chunan). Chen Chunan stated that the estate was small and had already been divided. Judge Li noted that further evidence was necessary and adjourned the case to May 10 for further hearing.</p>
<p>Morphine King Huang Linqi Apprehended; Disguised as Female Relatives; Exposed by Police</p>
<p>Wu Zhengding, the chief of the Sixth District, Third Precinct of the Shanghai West Caohejing Town Public Security Bureau, received a tip that Huang Linqi, a Chongming native nicknamed "Morphine King," was short and pockmarked, aged 29, residing at No. 58 Yuanfu Lane, Yuanfang Road. He had a private car, Shanghai license No. 6912 and Concession permit No. 3618, or rode a motorcycle to traffic drugs, often traveling between Shanghai and Minhang with his family to avoid police inspection. Chief Wu dispatched officers to monitor him. Yesterday afternoon at 4:10 p.m., Huang Linqi, accompanied by his concubine and a girl, was transporting drugs in a car with Shanghai license No. 6912 and Concession permit No. 3618, traveling to Wujiagang. When passing the Caoxi Road Caojia Ancestral Hall area, Officer Zhang Miaoyun noticed them and ordered them to stop, but Huang refused and sped past. Officer Zhang blew his whistle and gave chase. Sergeant Ma Jilong and Officer Zhang Jinshan also drew their guns and blocked the road, forcing Huang to stop. Sergeant Ma, realizing the gravity of the situation, did not search the car himself but returned to the station to report to Chief Wu. Inspector Yuan Desheng found twelve paper packets and ten bottles of morphine, worth over a thousand yuan, under the rear seat cushion. Huang Linqi claimed that the morphine was given to him by Cai Hongzhang, who lived in the Meijialong area, and instructed him to deliver it to the Wujia Lane area, seven kilometers from Shanghai-Minhang South Zhe Road, where Cai would pick it up. The woman with him was his girlfriend, and the young girl was his younger sister, Huang Anan, aged seven. The woman claimed to be Shen A'er, aged 18, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 46 Mingzhu Street inside the Old North Gate, with her father named Shen Shiben. She and her younger sister Shen A'si (aged 15) were traveling to the countryside for leisure and knew nothing about Huang's morphine. Chief Wu, considering the case involved drug trafficking, prepared a document and, along with the car, transferred the case to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily reported that on the 28th, at 7:30 a.m., the Japanese Mail Steamer Nagasaki Maru, en route from Kobe, was about thirty nautical miles off Yushan Island outside the Wusong Estuary when a passenger named Araki Isohichi jumped from the rear deck into the sea.

<p>Real Estate Merchant Pang Hengping Sued by Concubine for Attempted Murder; Twelve Years of Cohabitation End in Conflict; Pang's Lawyer Requests Reconciliation</p>
<p>Pang Hengping, a 34-year-old real estate merchant from a prominent family in Wuxing, Zhejiang, is known for his wealth and fondness for pleasure. Twelve years ago, he took Shi Yuefang, a woman from Suzhou in her thirties, as his concubine. She was charming and graceful. Since living with Pang, their relationship had been harmonious, without any disputes for a decade. Unexpectedly, their relationship soured, and Shi Yuefang engaged a lawyer to sue Pang in the First Special District Court for attempted murder, requesting a trial. The afternoon before yesterday, Judge Wu Tingqi convened a hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Shi Yuefang, appeared as summoned, while the defendant, Pang Hengping, was accompanied by his lawyer, Jiang Yiping. Judge Wu inquired about the ages and origins of both parties. Defendant's lawyer Jiang then stated that the parties were husband and concubine and had lived together for twelve years with a close relationship. The current lawsuit was due to a minor matter. The defendant was from a respected family in Wuxing, and this matter was a matter of dignity. Therefore, he requested the court to postpone the interrogation of the case's details so that both families could mediate and prevent a rupture. The defendant was not making concessions because he was guilty but because of the twelve-year relationship and did not want to litigate in court over a trivial matter. The defendant wished for the plaintiff to return home and continue their cohabitation, requesting an adjournment. The judge questioned Shi Yuefang and granted the request, adjourning the case for reconciliation. If reconciliation failed, the trial would proceed.</p>
<p>China General Edison Company Actively Upgrading Tracks</p>
<p>The China General Edison Company, due to the damage to the original tracks, has been continuously upgrading them to concrete steel rails. The tracks on the Outer Bund, Zhonghua Road, and Minguo Road have been largely completed. Currently, the section from Xihua Lane to the Shanghai South Licensing Office of the Public Works Department on Zhonghua Road is being upgraded. Additionally, as the section between Shangwenmen and Daxing Street (used by Routes 2 and 4) currently has only a single track, causing delays for passing vehicles, it is planned to convert this section to a double track after the completion of the other road works. At the same time, the Gaochangmiao station will also be converted to a double track.</p>

<p>Dead Concubine Implicates Living One: Ji Xuexin Dies Suddenly; Zhou Chen Suspected</p>
<p>Zhou Shangen, a 33-year-old Ningbo native, worked as a tea server at the Jiangnan Wharf Fish Guild. Through diligence and frugality, he saved a thousand yuan and opened a Xinyifeng cigarette and exchange shop at No. 107 Guangqi Road in the city two years ago. However, due to his busy schedule at the guild, he entrusted all matters of the shop to his wife, Chen (30 years old). In June of last year, Chen set up a cold food stall in front of the shop, selling various sodas and ice cream. A Nanjing native named Li Xuexin (also known as Ye A'er), who was unemployed and made a living by extorting people in the Guangqi Road area, often frequented the Xinyifeng shop for casual conversation. He became acquainted with Chen, and because Chen was not unattractive, Li often helped her make ice cream, feigning diligence and taking advantage of opportunities to seduce her. Soon, Chen fell for him and invited him to stay at the shop, providing him with food and clothing, nominally as a partner but in reality as her lover. Zhou, although aware of this, dared not expel Li due to Chen's fierce nature. Later, Zhou, due to poor business at the shop, suffered significant losses and sold the shop to a Zhenjiang native named Hu in August last year. Chen also moved to the upper floor of the shop. However, since Zhou rarely returned home, Li Xuexin continued his affair with Chen. Recently, Zhou returned to his hometown on business, and Li often stayed at Zhou's house, indulging in pleasures. Unexpectedly, around noon yesterday, Li suddenly died. Around 4 p.m., the First Precinct of the First District received a tip that Li's death was due to engaging in illicit acts with Chen during the day, catching a cold, and suffering from "jia yin shang han" (a type of cold), which proved fatal. Precinct Chief Liu immediately dispatched Sergeant Li Fuyi to investigate at the address. However, Chen had already moved Li's body elsewhere. Chen was taken to the station for interrogation by Chief Liu. Chen claimed that Li Xuexin had a good heart and treated her well, so he often came to her place for leisure. On the 27th of this month, Li came to her house for dinner and had some wine. He stayed overnight, but the next morning, he complained of stomach pain and took some opium, which relieved the pain slightly. Then, Li cooked lunch for her. After that, his stomach pain worsened, and he writhed in bed. She was worried that he had "fa sha" (a type of ailment) and called Dr. Wang from a nearby stove shop to perform "tiao sha" (a type of traditional treatment), but it was ineffective. She then took him to the Shanghai Hospital, where the doctor said he had volvulus and needed surgery. She refused and did not allow the surgery. Around 10 a.m. today (yesterday), Li's stomach pain subsided, and at his request, she took him home. Soon after, his condition worsened and became hopeless. He died. She then contacted his brother, Li Xuezhi, and told him the situation. Xuezhi suggested moving the body to the Xiying Public Office at No. 73 Liu Tomb Lane in Ji畝地 to prepare for the coffin and burial. As for the cause of his illness, she claimed ignorance. At the same time, the deceased's brother, Li Xuezhi, along with his father, Li Mingsong, and mother, Wang, surrendered themselves, claiming that they had learned of their brother's sudden death and rushed to Zhou's house to inspect the situation. They then went out to find their parents, but Chen had moved the body elsewhere without their consent, so their parents did not see the deceased. As for the cause of their brother's death, whether it was murder or something else, they did not know and requested a thorough investigation. Li Mingsong and Wang's statements were consistent with their son's. As the case was bizarre and concerned human life, the land chief was ordered to report to the Shanghai Local Court to request a coroner's examination to determine the cause of death. The parties involved were temporarily detained for further investigation.</p>
<p>Gunfire in the Dark on Datong Road: Two Detectives Ambushed While Pursuing Robbers; Li Qiliang Dies on the Spot, Li Liangfu Severely Injured; District Chief Gong Personally Investigates, Detectives Hunt Through the Night</p>
<p>Since Gong Xikui was appointed as the District Chief of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, he has spared no effort in rectifying police affairs. In less than a month, significant progress has been made, and Gong is particularly concerned about public security. In addition to dispatching detectives and patrol officers to patrol around the clock, Gong himself personally inspects various locations every night. Around 8 p.m. last night, Detective Team Leader Wang Shifu led detectives Li Qiliang, Li Guiqing, assistant detective Li Liangfu, and police officer Zhu Tao, among others, on patrol from Datong Road north to Zhongxing Road. They first passed through residential areas and then headed south to Jiaotong Road. While walking to the entrance of Jiu'an Lane near the relief station, they suddenly saw four men approaching in the dark, looking flustered. Upon closer inspection, the detectives noticed that three of the men were wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, and one was wearing black cloth shirts and pants. As they were about to turn around and flee, the detectives ordered them to stop. The four men dispersed and fled in the northeast and southwest directions. The detectives gave chase and ordered them to stop again. Before the words were finished, gunshots rang out, and bullets came from the northeast. The detectives also dispersed and returned fire. Amid the gunfire, assistant detective Li Liangfu was shot in the back of the neck and fell to the ground. Two robbers escaped. Detectives Li Qiliang and police officer Zhu Tao pursued the other two robbers to the Sun Temple. The distance was very close. Li Qiliang, without regard for his own safety, tried to rush forward, but in the darkness, he was ambushed by a robber and shot in the left chest. Li tried to persist but collapsed and died due to his severe injuries. The other two robbers took the opportunity to escape. Detective Team Leader Wang Shifu returned to the district office to report and urgently sent the injured assistant detective Li Liangfu to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. His injuries were severe, and his life was in danger. After hearing the news, District Chief Gong personally went to the scene to investigate and dispatched all officers and detectives to hunt down the suspects. He also sent notices to other districts requesting their assistance in the search. Detective Li Qiliang, who died in the line of duty, was ordered to be examined and coffined by the local warden this morning, temporarily placed in the Pingjiang Cemetery, and reported to the General Bureau for compensation.</p>

He was remanded in custody for further investigation. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xie convened a continued hearing in the Third Criminal Court. 工部局 lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that Zhong Xincai was involved in a gang robbery of the Xu family in Jiangwan, but the Public Security Bureau was not notified. The second defendant, Ruan Guojing, stole a gold watch worth 55 yuan from Zhou Wen's house at No. 678 Jing'an Temple Road in January. He was prosecuted under the Military Gun Control Regulations and the theft charge. Upon questioning the two defendants, their statements were evasive. Zhang Jinlong, the cook at Zhou's house on Jing'an Temple Road, testified that Ruan Guojing stole the gold watch while repairing the water pipe. Judge Xiao Xie sentenced Zhong Xincai to eight months in prison and Ruan Guojing to nine months in prison. The number of days detained before the judgment became final were deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment. The pistol and bullets were confiscated.</p>

Lin Di is promiscuous and has also become romantically involved with Zhang Yonglong, a Changzhou native at No. 20 Sanminfang, Yangzhou Road. Lu found out about this. Around 7 p.m. the night before last, Lin Di suddenly went missing. Lu suspected that she was secretly meeting with Zhang, so he gathered his younger brother Lu Shuigen and a friend, Kan A'san from Wuxi, each armed with iron rods, and secretly went to Zhang's residence at 10:40 p.m. They found the doors closed and broke them open with the rods.

They learned the location of Lu Jusheng and Kan A'san and dispatched detectives to arrest them. The police chief ordered them all to be detained. The injured Zhang was taken to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the three defendants to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. 工部局 Lawyer Wang Yaotang recounted the events, stating that the victim was severely injured and unable to speak. He requested an adjournment for further investigation. After the detectives presented the iron rods for inspection, the three defendants gave evasive statements. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>
<p>Maid Commits Suicide by Hanging After Being Fired for Not Knowing Foreign Languages</p>
<p>Liu Suqin, a woman from Qingjiangpu, about 20 years old, recently came to Shanghai and was recommended to work as an amah (maid) for a foreigner's family. However, she was fired after only ten days for not knowing foreign languages and for demanding higher wages. She stayed at the home of a fellow townsman, Gan Yutian, at No. 2 Sande Lane, Rue Gansidong in the French Concession. Liu felt resentful for being unable to earn a high salary due to her lack of foreign language skills. Despondent, she committed suicide by hanging herself from a water pipe in the toilet around 6 a.m. on the 28th, taking advantage of Gan's family being out. Around 8 a.m., Gan returned home and found her barely alive and still warm. Gan rushed her to the Guangci Hospital, but she died before receiving treatment. The French Police Station was notified and sent detectives to investigate. The deceased had no family in Shanghai. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Morgue for examination and reported to the Second Special Court for a coroner's examination today.</p>
<p>Westerner's Mastiff Poisoned</p>
<p>On the evening of April 25, two fine Danish mastiffs belonging to a Westerner in Shanghai West were poisoned</p>
<h3 id="e80">王正林有志竟成　—陳樹森退列第四— <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>A Will to Succeed: Wang Zhengling's Achievement — Chen Shusen Falls to Fourth Place —</p>
<p>The 10,000-meter race was the most exciting event. Wang Zhengling, a famous athlete nicknamed "Monkey King," was indignant at not being selected for the Far Eastern Games. Wang was not originally qualified to participate in yesterday's meet, but was allowed to join as it was an unofficial competition, with the goal of avenging his previous grievances. As expected, he achieved his ambition and won the championship. It was no wonder that there was thunderous applause and cheers after both races. Chen Shusen, a famous athlete from Shanxi, was deeply saddened by the death of Sun Che, which inevitably affected his performance, causing him to fall to fourth place. Jin Zhongkang also joined temporarily, but his performance was mediocre and he withdrew halfway through. Where are the heroes of the past now? This competition lasted the longest. The Russian, Lav Qinggu, was also a leader in this event. At the World Games two years ago, Lav overtook Wang Zhengling in the final sprint, winning by a shoulder's length. Yesterday, he tried to catch up with Wang Zhengling in the final lap, but eventually lost due to exhaustion. Wang started sprinting immediately after the last lap's starting gun and went all the way to the end, a feat that was particularly commendable. Hui La had a fierce competition with Wang and Chen in the middle of the race, and finally finished third. Wang's time was 35 minutes 6.6 seconds, which was not as good as the late Sun Che's 34 minutes 9 seconds in the national trials, but it still broke Liu Guxue's national record of 35 minutes 27.8 seconds from two years ago.</p>
<p>Peng Yongxin Is Mature and Reliable — Leng Peigen's Discus Performance Declines —</p>
<p>The pole vault was canceled due to the lack of Western athletes. The same was true for the triple jump. The long jump and high jump did not produce good results. There were also no capable Western athletes in these events. Wang Jihuai won the long jump again, with a mere 6.39 meters. Hao Chunde was second with 6.38 meters, and the Westerner Lalo Lai was third with 5.43 meters. Fu Baolu joined the high jump as a guest and finished third with 1.50 meters. Wu Bi and Wang Shilin each achieved 1.60 meters, simply going through the motions. Peng Yongxin maintained his usual standard in the javelin, achieving 48.50 meters despite the headwind, making him the most mature and reliable of our country's athletes. Leng Peigen's discus performance declined. Liu Jingshan, also known as Liu (Renxiu), won the championship with 36.06 meters. Leng finished second with 33.70 meters, and Zhang Lingjia was third with 33.6 meters. Heks was fourth with 32.25 meters. The headwind had a significant impact.</p>
<p>Lin Shaozhou's High Hurdles Are Still Good — Wang Jingxi's Intermediate Hurdles Are Also Good —</p>
<p>Both athletes performed well in the hurdles. Lin Shaozhou achieved 16.9 seconds again, the same as in the trials. Wang Jingxi's time of 60.4 seconds in the intermediate hurdles was also good. Jian Jiang Yingjie did not participate due to fatigue from the Jiangda Games in the past few days.</p>
<p>The 1600-meter relay was not held. In the 400-meter relay, the Chinese team used veteran Hao Chunde in the second leg, with Zhao Bingheng running the first leg. However, Zhao's lack of training in baton passing caused many mistakes. Han Jinglin ran the third leg, and the baton passing was good. Cheng Jinguan ran the final leg and led the way in the fourth leg, with a time of 44.8 seconds, tying the Shanghai International record. The results of each event are as follows:</p>
<p>Event	First Place	Second Place	Third Place	Fourth Place	Result</p>

<p>Davis Cup Players Arrive in Marseille</p>
<p>(Havas News Agency, Marseille, April 28th) The Japanese Davis Cup players have arrived here aboard the Hakone Maru. After the captain, Sato Jiro, committed suicide by jumping into the sea in Singapore, the team members are now only Nishimura, Yamagishi, and Fujikura. According to Sato's suicide note, his suicide was due to a broken heart. However, according to Nishimura and the other two, Sato was afraid that his physical weakness would make it difficult for him to win and preferred to die rather than fail, so he committed suicide. Nishimura and the others have already departed for London tonight.</p>
<p>Letter from the Toothbrush Industry Union Football Team</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We were surprised to read in your newspaper's City Workers' Sports Games news column that Huadian defeated Toothbrush 5-0. After investigation, we discovered that many of the players on the Huadian team were brought in from the Jiangnan and Binggong factories. Our team originally intended to suspend the match, but to maintain order, we temporarily played the game. At the time, we stated to Mr. Xu Duo that there were violations of the regulations. Mr. Xu Duo also inquired about the team members and confirmed the issue. Therefore, in addition to protesting to the organizing committee of the Workers' Sports Games, we are also sending this letter to clarify the matter and request a correction in the report to avoid spreading misinformation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>(Hankou Correspondent) Zhou Xuechang, the Director of the Education Department of Shaanxi Province, organized an education delegation to visit various parts of the country to improve education in Shaanxi. The delegation consists of over twenty people and is divided into two routes: the northern route to Pingjin to study primary school education, and the southern route to Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu to study secondary schools, normal schools, vocational schools, and social education. The delegation departed from Xi'an on April 23rd and arrived in Zhengzhou on the 24th, where they split into northern and southern routes.

<p>Regulations on Subsidies for Faculty Studying Abroad</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a submission from National Tsinghua University regarding the formulation of regulations for providing subsidies to faculty studying abroad for approval and compliance, instructed the university as follows: The Ministry currently does not have laws or regulations regarding schools providing subsidies to faculty for studying abroad. For such cases, schools may temporarily, based on the requests of full-time faculty members who are paying their own way to study abroad, consider the school's teaching needs, general financial situation, teaching performance, research ability, and length of service (at least five years of continuous service), conduct a strict review, determine the amount and duration of the subsidy, and submit it to the Ministry for approval. The required expenses should be paid within the school's existing budget and should not require special regulations. Faculty members who receive this subsidy to study abroad should return to the school to work after returning to the country.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Persuades Students to End Strike at Songjiang High School</p>
<p>(Songjiang Correspondent) The entire senior class of the provincial Songjiang High School is striking against the final examination. The principal expelled three students, including Tang Zeyi, and eight students were given major demerits. The case was reported to the Education Department. Subsequently, many students in the same grade voluntarily withdrew from school, and the student unrest spiraled out of control. The students also compiled and mimeographed a publication called "Laoyan Ji" (mistakenly reported as "Laoying Ji" yesterday), which was bound at Dashengchang Paper Shop. The school authorities discovered it, considered it insulting, and requested the Public Security Bureau to confiscate it. The students demanded the cancellation of the final examination and the revocation of the expulsion orders, but the school refused. Both sides have taken extreme measures, and the situation is on the verge of getting out of control. Today, County Magistrate Jin Tigan, following the instructions of the Education Department, immediately persuaded the students to comply and avoid disrupting their studies. Mr. Jin went to gather the students in the class this afternoon (April 29th) and earnestly persuaded them.</p>
<p>Shanghai Social Education Association Established Yesterday</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan and Others Elected as Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>Petitioned the Education Bureau to Increase Social Education Funding</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Education Association, an organization dedicated to studying social education and promoting social education, has completed its preparations and held its inaugural meeting at the Municipal People's Education Center yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. The association passed its charter and elected directors and supervisors. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Members</p>
<p>The attendees yesterday included Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, Municipal Party Department Representative Zhu Jiarang, and members Chen Bai, She Gang, Xu Zerang, Ma Chonggan, Chen Jicheng, Xu Zeye, Jiang Jianbai, Zheng Zhengqiu, Ding Shoutang, Yuan Zengyu, Chen Songchun, Shen Xiangrui, Chen Dongbai, Zhu Jimin, Shen Jiesheng, Wang Keyong, Li Wanyu, Wang Zhuangfei, Lv Hailan, Zhang Yongchun, Yang Nengshi, Huang Jianxin, Wang Meiyu, Li Dachao, Wang Youyou, Zhang Futian, Ya Qian, Wang Jinqi, Jin Zaiye, and others, totaling over a hundred people.</p>
<p>Establishment Situation</p>
<p>The meeting began at 2 PM, with Pan Gongzhan, Chen Bai, Chen Jicheng, and Li Dachao serving as the presidium, Du Gang as the emcee, and Yuan Zengyu as the recorder. After the formalities, Chairman Chen Bai reported on the preparations. Municipal Party Department Representative Zhu Jiarang and Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan delivered speeches. The association then passed its charter, elected directors and supervisors, and discussed proposals. The meeting concluded with a group photograph in the evening.</p>
<p>Director's Speech</p>
<p>Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan stated that education cannot be accomplished solely by opening the doors of schools. School education is only a small part of education. The amount of time people spend in school education from childhood to old age is very short, and most people never have the opportunity to enter the doors of schools throughout their lives. Therefore, it is a big mistake to rely solely on school education to run education well. Ordinary people say that in addition to school education, there is also family education and social education. However, the family is not independent from society, and all aspects of the family are affected by society. Therefore, educational undertakings other than school education can be directly or indirectly included in social education. Social education is longer than school education in terms of time, and it is also broader than school education in terms of space. Therefore, we cannot ignore the effectiveness of social education. Sometimes, the knowledge taught to students in schools often does not match the reality expressed in society, or even goes against it. As a result, the achievements of school education are often completely ineffective due to the bad inducements of society. For example, schools teach students to believe in science and not to be superstitious, but superstition is very common in society. This proves that the knowledge taught in schools and the path indicated to students are not as powerful as the outdated old forces in society. It is useless to only focus on teaching students well in schools. It is necessary to transform the social environment outside of schools so that what is taught in schools does not contradict what is expressed in society. This is the important responsibility that social education can shoulder. For example, newspapers are textbooks that are commonly read by the general public. Although newspaper offices do not hang the sign of a school, they are equivalent to schools, and their power is even greater than that of schools. If schools teach people to abide by morality and not to take the wrong path, but newspapers promote bad habits and customs, then what is taught in schools is completely ineffective. For example, movies have become a necessary form of entertainment for urban residents. If the content of movies is bad, it will affect countless viewers. Therefore, educational movies are not the only ones that are considered educational. All movies contain educational meaning, but the difference lies in whether they teach well or badly. Other things such as broadcasting, drama, and the humorous performances in game halls are all educational undertakings. Therefore, the scope of social education is far beyond what school education can reach. Education is not something that can be handled by administrative agencies and schools alone. It is necessary for administrative agencies to cooperate with social undertakings in order to reform and integrate good meanings into entertainment and leisure in the content spread by the above-mentioned educational tools. It is hoped that the Shanghai Social Education Association will bear this important responsibility after its establishment.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>(1) To request the Education Bureau to increase the city's social education funding to at least 20% of the total education funding from fiscal year 23 onwards to facilitate progress. (2) To investigate and organize folk entertainment. (3) To establish popular libraries. (4) To investigate the general situation of social education facilities in the city.

<p>University Faculty Association Held Its Second General Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Over 400 Faculty Members from Jinan, Jiaotong, and Other Universities Attended</p>
<p>Kang Xuanyi and 45 Others Elected as Executive Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Faculty Association held its second general meeting at the auditorium of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society yesterday afternoon at 2 PM and re-elected its officers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The attending members included faculty members from Jinan, Jiaotong, Fudan, Zhonggong, Guanghua, Daxia, Fazheng, Chizhi, Meizhuan, Jiangnan, Dongwu, Law School, Hujiang, Xinhua Art College, National Business College, Sino-French Industrial College, Chinese Medical College, Merchant Marine, and other schools, including Weng Zhilong, Guo Wei, Han Jue, Kang Xuanyi, Lin Zhongke, Jiang Jianbai, Meng Shoutun, Zhang, Zeng Zuozhong, Wang Yaxuan, Zhang Jixin, Jiang Zhensan, Zhu Zhangbao, Chen Jilie, Wang Xiaotong, Huang Xianzhang, Zhang Yiping, Tang Jinbai, Xing, Chao Enshao, and Wu Zijing, totaling over 400 people.

<p>Meeting Situation</p>
<p>The meeting began at 2 PM, with Weng Zhilong, Kang Xuanyi, Lin Zhongke, Jiang Hanping, Zhang Jixin, Jiang Zhensan, and Chen Jilie presiding over the meeting. Song Chongjiu was the emcee, and Zhong Xingzhu and Yang Bingxun were the recorders.

Then, the representative of the Municipal Education Bureau delivered a speech. The proposals were not discussed, and the officers were elected. The meeting adjourned at around 6 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Kang Xuanyi reported that today's second general meeting of the University Faculty Association had two slogans in the past year: "Saving the Country through Scholarship" and "Reviving Culture." Revival means regeneration or new life. To observe China's problems and seek national revival, we must first revive culture. We know that Western cultural history, from the Middle Ages to the present, is a kind of Renaissance movement. Since its establishment, the University Faculty Association has aimed to revive culture and save the country through scholarship. However, due to limited financial and human resources, our aspirations have not been fulfilled. We hope that the new executive and supervisory committee members will be able to carry forward and expand our goals.</p>
<p>Representative's Speech</p>
<p>Jiang Jianbai, the representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, stated that he had just heard the chairman put forward two major goals for the University Faculty Association: saving the country through scholarship and reviving culture. To achieve these two major goals, we must start with sincerity. Sincerity comes before accomplishment of oneself, and then accomplishment of things. Accomplishment of oneself is the means, and accomplishment of things is the goal. All of you here, standing in the position of university professors, should assume the responsibility of reviving culture. However, to achieve this great mission, we must first accomplish ourselves. Today, the need to revive Chinese culture and save the nation is undeniable. The work of accomplishing oneself is especially needed.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>(1) To organize a New Life Club for university faculty. Passed. (2) The Association should establish an academic forum. Passed. (3) To amend the articles of association to change the number of executive committee members from 31 to 45, alternate executive committee members from 7 to 15, supervisory committee members from 7 to 11, and alternate supervisory committee members from 3 to 7. Passed. (4) The Association should edit a series of national cultural books to refine the national spirit. Passed.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<p>National Education is the Foundation of National Prosperity (II)</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>It is important to understand that each era has its own knowledge. Knowledge evolves with the needs of the people's lives and is boundless. In the past, the lives of our grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and great-great-grandfathers were much simpler than they are now. The knowledge they needed was also much less than what is needed now. As long as they could solve the problems of their lives at that time, it was enough. People in our era, especially you children and students, will need much more knowledge when you go to society to serve and do things ten or twenty years from now. The needs will certainly be much greater than in the era of our grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and great-great-grandfathers. When that time comes, the social situation will be more complex and the need for knowledge will be even greater.</p>
<p>For example, in the past, our great-grandfathers and great-great-grandfathers built houses with mud or bricks, which was very simple. Therefore, the knowledge needed to build houses at that time was also very simple. Now, it is not so simple to build houses. Now, we need architecture to build a house, first drawing plans and then starting construction. This architecture includes many sciences, such as physics, hygiene, and lighting. This knowledge of building houses is very different from what it used to be. Let's take cooking as another example. In the past, firewood was used as fuel. But now, except in remote areas with inconvenient transportation, where firewood is still used to cook, we all use coal to cook in cities and villages with more convenient transportation. Mining coal requires knowledge, including geology, mining, and other sciences. Therefore, the knowledge of cooking is also very different from what it used to be. Let's take farming as an example. This seems to be a very easy thing. In the past, our ancestors farmed with very simple methods such as hoes. But today, farming also requires knowledge and is not an easy task. China's land is like this, the population is increasing day by day, and the demand for food is increasing day by day. We must think of ways to improve our farming methods and increase production, which requires knowledge. This knowledge of farming includes botany, agricultural chemistry, and mechanics to improve our local soil, seeds, fertilizers, farm implements, and farming methods.</p>
<p>For example, if a field used to yield two dans of grain, we now need to use knowledge to make it yield three dans of grain. Without knowledge, not only will we not be able to yield three dans of grain, but we may not even be able to yield two dans of grain, and the yield will decrease year by year. Therefore, farming also requires knowledge. I take building houses, cooking, and farming as examples. Whether it is building houses, cooking, or farming, the knowledge and ability required in the past were very little, but now it is much more difficult than before. Because it is difficult, we need to have knowledge to solve the difficult problems.</p>

<p>Reasons for the Reduction in the Amount of the American Cotton Loan</p>
<p>Di Xian</p>
<p>Since 1930, the cry for insufficient domestic cotton supply has been growing louder. As the largest industry in the country, yarn factories are declining due to expensive cotton and cheap yarn. The cotton shortage can be said to have reached its extreme. Therefore, when Mr. Song Ziwen attended the World Economic Conference last year, he visited Roosevelt and proposed a loan to purchase cotton from the United States. As soon as the news came out, domestic opinion was almost unanimously opposed. Economists believed that the harm of loans outweighed the benefits. Some even questioned whether this cotton was needed domestically. This view was repeatedly seen in articles discussing cotton and wheat loans in various domestic publications in the second half of last year. At that time, the situation of expensive cotton and cheap yarn was still becoming more serious. Therefore, some people thought that this kind of argument was irrelevant to the facts. Unexpectedly, the facts coincided with this kind of argument. At first, yarn factories did not show enthusiastic interest in cotton. After the cotton was imported, no one asked about it, which eventually led to misunderstandings about factory demands. However, since last autumn, imported foreign cotton has indeed decreased significantly. Yarn factories do not seem to have abandoned this cotton and purchased other cotton. Therefore, the talk of demands is no longer valid. Time flies, and another year has passed. The cotton loan agreement is about to expire. The authorities also realized that cotton loans are not easy to sell and had no choice but to negotiate with the United States to reduce the loan amount from 40 million gold yuan to 10 million gold yuan. This matter is a major issue in the political and economic history of our country in recent years, and its changes are particularly worthy of study. This article will briefly elaborate on the reasons why Shang cotton cannot be sold from a statistical perspective, in order to provide reference for those who discuss the cotton loan issue.</p>
<p>After the news of the cotton loan from the United States came on May 6, 1933, the two things that Chinese people were most concerned about were whether our country could accommodate such a large amount of cotton and what the relationship between importing a large amount of foreign cotton and domestic cotton production would be. It was enough to lower the price of cotton and affect cotton farmers. These two points are what should be paid attention to when discussing the cotton loan issue. However, what we were worried about at the time was not this, but whether this cotton could be imported into our country. The so-called impact on domestic cotton production must wait until it is imported before it can have an impact. If there is no possibility of importing it at all, then there is no need to worry about the relationship after it is imported. However, the meaning of whether it can accommodate this cotton and whether it can be imported that we are worried about are not the same.</p>
<p>Judging from past customs reports, the cotton purchased with loans from the United States was not enough to raise the question of whether the country could accommodate this cotton. The comparison of foreign cotton imported into our country in the past three years is as follows (unit: dan):</p>
<p>Year	19	20	21</p>
<p>From India	2,131,990	1,811,076	453,629</p>
<p>From the United States	1,288,830	2,573,757	3,102,351</p>
<p>From Other Countries	31,674	303,248	163,543</p>
<p>Total	3,456,494	4,688,081	3,719,523</p>
<p>At that time, we estimated from the price of cotton that the cotton purchased with the loan was about 2 million dan, which is about 600,000 bales. If only the price of cotton is calculated, it is more than this number, but adding expenses and taxes, the purchase number is only like this. Compared with the above table, the quantity of 2 million dan has no concern of not being able to accommodate this cotton except for 19 years. Therefore, President Wang Jingwei also stated the reason for the government's cotton loan based on the customs import figures in the central report. Some people believe that foreign cotton imported into our country is not entirely consumed by Chinese yarn factories. Japanese yarn factories in the country have a large number of spindles and mostly spin fine yarn, so they must use a lot of American cotton. The government's cotton loan to maintain Chinese factories seems to be unable to sell to Japanese factories. If sales are limited to Chinese factories, they will not be able to accommodate it. There is reason for this statement, but the government's original intention in borrowing cotton from the United States is to borrow money to buy cotton, or to buy cotton to borrow money, and there is no way to know the truth. If it is to borrow money to buy cotton, then selling it to Japanese factories is not a problem. Now, the government will use the relief of Chinese factories' raw material panic as buying cotton to borrow money, and not being able to sell to Japanese factories will not lead to a large surplus. The following table is a comparison of the classification of cotton used by yarn factories across the country in 1932 by the country of the yarn factory (unit: bales, each bale is 500 pounds):</p>
<p>Factory	Chinese Factory	Japanese Factory	British Factory	Total</p>
<p>Chinese Cotton	1,010,026	242,113	13,946	1,266,085</p>
<p>American Cotton	476,720	363,657	67,754	908,131</p>
<p>Indian Cotton	110,241	89,862	4,706	204,809</p>
<p>Egyptian Cotton	1,528	9,771	—	11,299</p>
<p>Other Cotton	458	134	—	592</p>
<p>Total	1,598,972	705,537	86,406	2,390,916</p>
<p>American Cotton Sales	In one year, it was 476,720 bales, which is 124,000 bales less than the 600,000 bales of cotton on loan. If the factory's inventory</p>

<p>The Vitality of Essays</p>
<p>Chong Xun</p>
<p>Last year was when "humor" had great luck. Besides "The Analects," people started and ended with humor. This person was a humorist, and that person was also a humorist. Unexpectedly, this year it completely collapsed. This wasn't right, that wasn't right, all sins were attributed to humor, even comparing it to the clown in the literary arena. Scolding humor was like taking a bath, as if just doing it once would make oneself clean.</p>
<p>If it were truly a "grand theater of heaven and earth," then the literary arena would certainly have clowns—but it would also certainly have leading male roles. Clowns singing clown plays is very common, but a leading male role changing to sing a clown play is very strange, but in the grand theater, such things sometimes really happen. This makes straightforward people follow crooked people in mocking, passionate people become angry, and fragile people feel sad. Is it because they sing poorly and don't make people laugh? It's not that; they are even more laughable than real clowns.</p>
<p>The anger and sadness are because after the leading male role changes to sing a clown play, things are not over. A theatrical performance must have several roles: leading male, supporting male, secondary male, clown, painted-face role, and also a leading male. Otherwise, the play won't last long. When, for some reason, the leading male has to change to sing a clown play, according to precedent, a real clown must come to change to sing a leading male role. Not just the singing skills, but simply the leading male shamelessly playing the clown, and the clown puffing out his chest to imitate the leading male, the theater only seeing white-nosed and black-faced clowns increasing, it would be the biggest joke in the world—however, it's just a joke, not humor. Someone said, "China has no humor." This is exactly an annotation.</p>
<p>Even more regrettable is that Mr. Lin, who was posthumously named "Master of Humor," even quoted the words of the ancients in "Free Talk," saying, "Drinking and going wild, or being silent and unknown, is just keeping oneself clean. Today's lepers want to make those who keep themselves clean bear the crime of national subjugation. If so, then those of the 'today gathered like crows, tomorrow scattered like birds; today rebelling, tomorrow leaning on the carriage rail; today a gentleman, tomorrow a petty man; today a petty man, tomorrow again a gentleman' type can be without sin." Although the quotation still doesn't depart from essays, it's far from the way of "humor" or "leisure." This is another annotation.</p>
<p>But Mr. Lin believes that the recent attacks on "Ren Jian Shi" in various newspapers are a systematic, disguised trick, which is wrong, as evidenced by the different arguments and different styles. Among them, there are certainly "celebrities" who, although once attached to a fast horse, ultimately failed to ascend as a dragon, or are playing the leading male role, but are actually true clowns making jokes, but there are also sincere people's candid remarks. The world is so chaotic, it can be seen that even essays are in need of analysis and attacks, which may be a glimmer of hope for "Ren Jian Shi."</p>

<p>Lin Yutang</p>
<p>"Ren Jian Shi" is published like "The Analects." Because no one is doing it, I'm doing it. I don't want to fall into the rut of others; if someone had already done it, I would never do it. Before, researching Chinese character indexes, compiling English textbooks, and recently researching typewriters, were all because I saw others not doing it, or not doing it well, so I came up with my own ideas and did it with great interest. What other reason is there? Now, it is clearly advocating essays, but for no reason, I am accused of seizing the title of "Orthodoxy of Literature." There are many categories of literature. I advocate essays, and others can advocate grand works; I run a publication to publish random thoughts that are published daily in Free Talk and are inconvenient to save, and others can run a publication dedicated to short stories. Can I forbid them? If tomorrow I see that there are no publications in the country dedicated to detective novels, and I run one, then someone will surely think that I have the ambition to make detective novels the "orthodoxy" of literature. This is truly the generalized thinking of national products. This kind of criticism is called the criticism of the spirit of square caps. In the past, scholars and celebrities didn't dare to run humorous publications, because the spirit of square caps was at work, unable to shake off the airs of scholars and celebrities, so it forced me to run one.</p>
<p>Today, Mr. "Da Ye" in Free Talk advises me, "If you want to walk the great path, don't take the small path; don't put the sea inside an ox's hoofprint; don't equate sunlight with fireflies." I should first promote Western culture and then promote essays. I agree with promoting Western culture. But Western culture is extremely complex and has many aspects. The New Culture Movement of the May Fourth Movement was a bit general. We should divide the work and cooperate to introduce and promote it according to our interests. Humor is a part of Western culture, and the skills of modern Western prose are also a part of Western literature. Outside of literature, there are also philosophy, economics, and society. I have no way, so you go and promote them. Modern cultural life is extremely rich. If I promote humor and essays, and unexpectedly, it proves to be effective, and unexpectedly, in addition to the humming and hawing school and the hang oh hang oh school of literature in China, another humorous school and essay school are added, and indirectly increase the richness of Chinese literature in terms of content, style, or tone, and even increase the richness of the spiritual life of the Chinese people, bringing them closer to Western culture, although I myself am inevitably surprised, just like a foreign Ph.D. being regarded as an expert in Western literature, I can also leave it to fate. Recently, I had a thought because I saw that the houses in the Shanghai alleyways are connected, and the shadows of flowers behind the curtains are often moving, and I thought of the automatic oilcloth window awnings in the United States, which can be pulled down or up with a single pull. Since no one has "promoted" or "introduced" them yet, I am also thinking of "promoting" them a bit. If the critics with the spirit of square caps don't accuse me of "promoting oilcloth window awnings to save the country," then I would be very fortunate.</p>
<p>In an article against the spirit of square caps, I must say a word of the spirit of square caps. If I can reduce a bit of the spirit of square caps in the country, and call on the people to adopt a more natural and lively view of life, then I will have done a little bit of national duty in the work of introducing Western culture. This sentence is also a remnant of my childhood habit of reading "Now, the world..." People will be surprised at how serious I am in life.</p>
<p>Random Notes</p>
<p>Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>What is China?</p>
<p>From the perspective of the barbarians, the Huaxia are called China, which is already established. During the Reform Movement of 1898 in the late Qing Dynasty, the Hunan Xiangxue Newspaper published a "Song of Awakening the World," which was said to be written by a scholar of classics and Mr. Lumentang, but was attributed to his son. There is a line in the song that says, "If you examine the Earth, China is not in the center. The Earth is a round object; who is in the center, who is on the side?" The intention was to dispel the closed-door arrogance and help the reform movement, so it said that China is not in the center of the Earth, meaning that the so-called barbarians of ancient times are not the foreign countries of today. Unexpectedly, the conservative Mr. Ye Langyuan (Dehui) saw it and strongly disagreed, sending a letter to Mr. Pi, saying, "The Earth is round, and one cannot point to one place as the center, but considering the east, west, north, and south together, the north and south poles do not connect, so when discussing the center and the outside, one should look at the east and west. Asia is located in the southeast of the Earth, and China is located in the middle of the east. Is there no middle and outside, and only no east and west? The order of the four seasons is spring and summer first, and the position of the five elements starts with the southeast. This is understood by both Chinese and Westerners, not that China人为 is external. The color yellow belongs to earth, and earth belongs to the center. Westerners classify the Chinese as the yellow race, which means that from the beginning of the creation of heaven and earth, they implicitly gave the Chinese the central position. Westerners laugh at China for being arrogant; why not explain this principle to them?" What is China? With this interpretation, wouldn't it be wonderful!</p>
<p>Living Mencius</p>
<p>During the Tang Dynasty, Lin Shensi wrote two volumes to continue the Book of Mencius, positioning himself as Mencius. In the Yuan Dynasty, Hu Changru, with the name Wuming, studied the learning of the original mind, generously considering himself to be Mencius. As for the Ming Dynasty, there was someone called the "Living Mencius." The learning of the Ming scholar Chen Xianzhang was said to be based on 静, peacefulness, and he was content. He taught his students to sit upright and calm their minds, cultivating a sense of awareness in stillness. Commentators at the time said that Chen had the joy of 澄飞鱼跃, clear flying fish jumping, and some even called him the "Living Mencius." There was also the writer Sang Yue, known for his strangeness and arrogance, suffering from megalomania, not content with calling himself "Talented Scholar of Jiangnan," and even comparing himself to Mencius. Sang Yue and Chen Xianzhang lived in the same period, and for a time there were two "Living Mencius," but one was called by others, and the other called himself. Some say that there are also people today who call themselves "Talented Scholar of Jiangnan," but it is not known whether they compare themselves to the "Living Mencius"?</p>
<p>On "Innocence"</p>
<p>Wu Rong</p>
<p>I am not very clear about the inside story of Christianity, but I feel that the words in the New Testament that only children can enter the Kingdom of Heaven make some sense. Children are not as good as adults in everything, but they are not so bad that they do not know how to live or do not want to live. If you do not give him food, he will cry and shout with a long face regardless of any situation; if you give him enough to eat and he wants more, he will smile with his lips regardless of whether there are still tears hanging from the corners of his eyes. This is what is called innocence. But children do not know that they are innocent, let alone that innocence can be advertised for sale.</p>
<p>The merit of a child's innocence seems to lie in not knowing that innocence can be advertised for sale, and being able to purely follow the nature of life to use his laughter and crying.</p>
<p>The world is full of people who flock to the powerful and influential. In modern times, we have only heard of people "selling smiles," but we have not heard of anyone "selling tears." This shows that only smiles can be bought. Although there are many who cry, not only can they not sell it, but it is even an obstacle. "The sound of crying goes straight to the sky" is also recorded by a rare fool.</p>
<p>The rule of our world is: only laughter is allowed, not crying. It is necessary to laugh when happy, and also to laugh when suffering; it is necessary to laugh when leisurely, and also to laugh when busy. A face born from nature is made into two countries: the whole world supports the mouth and resists the eyes. Or, for the same actions of this eye and this mouth, they are divided into two irreconcilable parties: the whole world is a party of smiles and hates the so-called "mourning." Thus, smiling faces are all over the world.</p>
<p>Many people do not know that simply smiling is against innocence, but instead think it is innocence. And innocence is lost. If you want to find innocence now, you can only go to children or fools who are like children.</p>
<p>People often say "innocence" and "detachment" together, but they are not the same. The great Chinese humorist Jin Shengtan once said, "Being beheaded is the greatest pain, but Shengtan obtained it unintentionally, which is very strange." This can be called detachment, but not innocence. If it were innocence, not to mention killing him, even scaring him would make him cry. Detachment is to detach from life, to think that life is not a problem. But innocence is to want to live, to follow life, to take pleasure as pleasure, suffering as suffering, leisure as leisure, and busyness as busyness.</p>
<p>An innocent person will not have Ah Q-style humor, taking cowardice as bravery and coldness as warmth. He does not want to talk about foxes and ghosts, or use ghosts and gods to teach people, nor does he understand why hearing about foxes and ghosts makes one frown, which is considered to be the air of a moralist.</p>
<p>Their innocence is the innocence of purely following life, not the innocence of detaching from life. If there is truly a paradise of life in the world, those who enter it are probably this group of innocent children who do not know the spirit of square caps?</p>

<p>After looking around like that, I returned to the front of the Shijia Hotel. But I didn't want to go to the room, I just looked at the signboard to see if the two relatives who also said they wanted to go to the countryside had arrived. They hadn't arrived yet. I thought about going to Lingyan, but I didn't really want to go. I kept thinking about the only relative in Mu Du, although I had decided not to go before I left. Because I had decided not to go, I didn't ask clearly about their family situation in the past ten years, I only vaguely knew that they were often dying, but I didn't know who had died. But I was thinking about going; and while thinking, I was already moving in the direction of their home.</p>
<p>When I arrived there, there was no one in the open house. I was a little timid. But finally, I walked in. Approaching the hall inside, I heard the sound of playing mahjong, which greatly encouraged me. I stepped into the hall, and the youngest son, whom I should call uncle, saw me. He had lived in Shanghai not long ago, so we knew each other. He stood up from the mahjong table to greet me. I asked him to continue playing, and I sat next to him. There was another person playing mahjong that I still remembered, who was the daughter-in-law of that family. I had hardly met the other two young women before, and I guessed they were my aunts. He was playing mahjong while chatting with me. He told me that his grandmother, his mother, had gone to the countryside. I didn't dare to ask him about his grandfather, because I didn't know if he was dead or still alive. Being so unfamiliar, I felt sorry. Soon I heard a cough coming in from outside. He was watching the children play mahjong.</p>
<p>Knowing that he was still alive, I stood up lightly.</p>
<p>He came in and told him who was there. He heard it and saw it, and was very happy.</p>
<p>"Last spring you said that you and Miss were coming, and we were looking forward to it every day," he said, recalling.</p>
<p>I couldn't remember saying that I was going, and how it was misunderstood; but I replied that we were going, but later something happened, and we couldn't get away.</p>
<p>Then he began to complain. He said that he had heard Jin Qiang Fu, saying: "Our family is really like the Yang family generals—you see, six of them have died, leaving only him."</p>
<p>This made me feel embarrassed, because I didn't know what to say.</p>
<p>After the mahjong game was over, snacks were prepared. After eating the noodles, he wanted me to go and see the small flower garden together.</p>
<p>The so-called small flower garden was a newly opened flower and tree shop just behind their house.</p>
<p>"The most poisonous thing is a woman's heart," he suddenly sighed, looking into the distance and evaluating the flowers and trees.</p>
<p>That sudden sigh surprised me, because he was already nearly seventy years old, and I didn't expect that he would still be so unwilling to let go of human affairs.</p>

<p>Dear Brother Lie Wen:</p>
<p>Today I saw the letters from Mr. Guo Ming and Mr. Xie Yunyi to you, intending to damage personal feelings. I reply with a few words to dispel doubts. After this, if there are articles with sincere criticism of the content or editing of Ren Jian Shi, feel free to publish them, and I will definitely accept them. If you only make emotional remarks, it seems meaningless.</p>
<p>Yutang</p>
<p>To Mr. Guo Ming and Mr. Xie Yunyi:</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Ming and Mr. Xie Yunyi: I have read your esteemed letter to me published in today's Free Talk. Although I know that you two busy people may not have had time to draft this letter personally, the publication of this letter clearly intends to damage the relationship between you and me. My previous article only said that "some people who have not yet succeeded in ascending the dragon are投稿 submitting disguised articles in Ren Yan Weekly, Ten Days Talk, Contradiction Monthly, China Daily, and Free Talk, systematically attacking Ren Jian Shi," and the letter believes that I said that "Ren Yan... has also made systematic attacks," precisely to make individuals avoid the limelight and make you and me become enemies. And wanting to make the relationship with "Ten Days Talk" light and the relationship with "Ren Yan" heavy, this method is also wonderful. This is the new art of Jing Huanlong, not just the art of ascending the dragon that he has painstakingly studied. This gentleman has a total of seven articles attacking me personally (the most recent article, "Talking Secrets," is published in today's received issue 27 of "Ten Days Talk"), so I call it "systematic." Just needing to take a look with the righteous eye of Wen Suchen, revealing him as a vulgar object, not a dragon, causing him to show his true form, everything will be safe and auspicious. I am determined not to be deceived by him and have misunderstandings with you two, and I hope that you, sir, will not sit and listen to a propaganda organ becoming a place for personal venting of emotions and scattering fake dragon urine. The letter does not allow for complete debate, so I will not debate.</p>
<p>By the way, I would like to state that I have always praised "Ren Yan" and despised "Ten Days Talk." The reason why I had to state in the announcement when I withdrew from the editorial board of "Ren Yan" was because I had already decided to edit "Ren Jian Shi" at that time, and I did not want outsiders to think of me as a street peddler.</p>

<p>American Mark Twain (Translated by Zun Han)</p>
<p>But in a secluded room of the Duke's mansion, there was a completely different scene. Princess Constance, the Duke's only daughter, leaned against a window. Her eyes were red and swollen, full of tears. She was all alone in the room. She began to mourn and said aloud:</p>
<p>"That cruel Marquis of Deqing is coming—my beautiful Duchy is gone—I can never believe this—alas, but there is no room for doubt!—And I loved him, I loved him—I dared to love him, although I knew—my father, the honorable Duke—would not allow me to marry him!—I loved him—I loved him—I hate him.—What is wrong with me?—I am mad, mad, mad!—Now everything is over!—"</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Several months passed. The people all praised the government of the young Gong Na. Everyone complimented him on the wisdom of his judgments, the generosity of his decisions, and the humility he possessed when performing his highest duties. Before long, the old Duke left all matters to him to handle, while he himself sat aside, listening with a proud happiness to his successor reading the Duke's decrees from the Prime Minister's seat. A crown prince as loved and praised by everyone as young Gong Na seemed to be very happy. But, strangely, he was not. Because he was very frightened to see that the Duke's daughter, Princess Constance, had fallen in love with him. Although all other love in the world was precious to him, this kind of love was full of danger. And he also saw that the happy Duke had also discovered his daughter's passion and was already secretly planning to marry them. The clouds of sorrow on the young woman's face gradually disappeared, and the hope and passion shining in her eyes gradually became clear. Gradually. That face, which had been so troubled, sometimes even showed a fleeting smile.</p>
<p>Gong Na was terrified to the extreme! He blamed himself for easily expressing the kind of intimacy that made him, when he first arrived here and felt strange, seek contact with a woman like himself. He was then depressed and anxious, tending towards a kind of friendship that only a woman could hope for or feel. He tried to avoid his cousin. But this made things worse, because, naturally, the more he avoided her, the more she tried to meet him. He was initially surprised by this, and then he felt fear. This simply became an entanglement, a chase. Day and night, she suddenly appeared before him anytime, anywhere. She seemed particularly uneasy. There was a secret in this.</p>
<p>This matter could not continue. It became the talk of the town. The Duke also seemed anxious. Fear and anxiety were inseparable from the poor Gong Na. One day, as he came out of a small hall in front of the picture gallery, Constance suddenly stood before him, took his hands, and cried out:</p>
<p>"Ah! Why are you avoiding me? What have I done wrong, what have I said wrong, that has ruined your favor towards me? Because I was sure to have gained your friendship before. Please don't despise me, Gong Na, please pity my painful heart. I can't be silent anymore. Silence will kill me. I love you.</p>
<p>Na! Please despise me, if you can. But this is a thing that had to be said."</p>
<p>Gong Na remained silent. Constance hesitated for a moment, then, misunderstanding his silence, a crude joy flashed in her eyes; she put her hands around his neck and said:</p>

<h3 id="e85">Stimulating Public Spirit and Activating Diplomacy in Shanghai Local Supplement <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Besides the power of politics, military affairs, and economy, public spirit and diplomacy are also very important for a country. If public spirit is vigorous, the country will show a prosperous appearance. If diplomacy is well used, the country can obtain benefits from many aspects. Therefore, no matter how decadent a country is, as long as its public spirit is not dead and its diplomacy is flexible, this country has hope for a turnaround. The reason why China is so depressed today is due to the weakness of politics, military affairs, and economy, and the decline of public spirit and the incompetence of diplomacy are also a major problem.</p>
<p>I think that in terms of saving the country today, increasing the practical strength of politics, military affairs, and economy is certainly important, but stimulating public spirit and activating diplomacy are also two urgent strategies. If public spirit is stimulated, the government will have a backing, and it can increase a lot of strength both internally and externally. Even the enemy will be frightened and know that our country is still not to be insulted. If diplomacy is activated, we can also obtain some help in the international arena, so that we will not be isolated and helpless.</p>
<p>How can we stimulate public spirit? The first step should be to awaken the people of the whole country through the world of speech, so that the Chinese people know that the national situation has reached a critical juncture, and unless everyone works together to overcome the difficulties, there will be no way to survive. The second step is for powerful people to organize the people of the whole country to carry out a vigorous movement to save the country and resist foreign aggression. The third step is for the whole country to intensify its efforts in the work of resisting Japan, so as to curb the enemy's vigor. The fourth step should be to strictly urge the government to quickly make various preparations in order to cope with future disasters. The fifth step is to implement national armament, and in times of extreme crisis, to make the determination to宁爲玉碎不作瓦全 rather be shattered like jade than be preserved like tile.</p>
<p>As for diplomacy, now is a good time for our country to be active. Our diplomatic authorities should take advantage of the powers' general offensive line against Japan and do their best to win over friendly countries to strengthen our country's power. Today, our diplomatic officials stationed abroad must have alert minds and agile skills, and contact the authorities of various countries in many ways, exchange opinions, explore the policies of various countries, and formulate our country's countermeasures. When the Japanese people distort the truth and confuse black and white in the international arena, they should immediately refute and correct them, so as not to let the truth be deceived by traitors. Moreover, we must not sit idly by and watch the Japanese people collude and implement actions that are detrimental to our country. In dealing with Japan, we must change the attitude of tolerance and submission that we have always had. Who says that weak countries have no diplomacy? I think that the weakness of a country is caused by the incompetence of diplomacy. However, the use of diplomacy mentioned here does not mean relying on foreigners. The unreliability of international assistance has given us many lessons in the Manchurian Incident. Even in the newly发生的事 实事件 newly发生的事 实incident, the reaction of the powers to Japan is only based on their own interests, and how can they have the real intention to help us 制日restrain Japan? However, although the powers now do not have the determination to directly conflict with Japan, it is also not their wish to sit idly by and watch Japan become stronger. Therefore, as long as there is an opportunity, in diplomacy, we still have the need to be active.</p>
<p>However, people must save themselves before others save them. While we want to take advantage of opportunities to obtain diplomatic assistance, the most urgent and important thing is the vigorous spirit of our own people.</p>
<p>What do we get in school?</p>
<p>Yi Er</p>
<p>When a person first enters school, he will inevitably have a very beautiful dream, hoping that in the future, in school, he can cultivate himself into a complete person with rich knowledge, solid skills, and excellent personality, so as to seek a foothold for himself and develop strategies for the society. After a few years, after graduating from school, and then turning back to look, what exactly did he get during his schooling?</p>
<p>Have not。</p>
<p>First, in terms of knowledge. What you get in school are nothing more than extremely limited, fragmented, superficial, and impractical things. How can that be considered knowledge? The school's arrangement of courses has no planning, no system, and no standard. The number of courses or types of courses to be offered each semester is purely determined by the number of teachers hired and the subjects that the teachers can teach. Therefore, some courses occupy a position almost every season; some courses have not been offered after one or two years. And they often ignore the more important ones and choose the unimportant ones. Also, for example, a certain subject should be completed in two semesters, but it is shortened to one semester. 甚至有的僅教一半，便中途停止了。even some are only taught for half, and then stopped halfway. What kind of impact does this have on students' studies? Anyone with common sense can understand. As for the teachers, there are certainly those with broad knowledge; but there are also not a few who are just muddling through. Perfunctoriness is their principle of teaching. Three days an incident, seven days a sickness. In class, although they gesticulate and talk about it in a colorful way; in the end, what the students get is "nothing"!</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of life. After a few years of school life, we have developed many bad habits. The four words "pride, luxury, ease, and pleasure" can probably sum up the form of student life. Not to mention the children of wealthy families, they cannot swallow the food at a table for eight people in the school. They go to restaurants three times a day to order delicacies. Straight suits, shiny leather shoes, and a change every other day; it doesn't have to be Sunday, they can also put down their homework and go to movie theaters and dance halls to seek pleasure. These are their due rights, because they have "Mac-Mac". Even the relatively poor ones, because of being infected by the bad environment, often tend to enjoy themselves. I often see a group of students who come from the interior or the countryside to study, their initial life is very simple; but soon after, they gradually learn to be fashionable. And the school takes a laissez-faire attitude and never pays attention to the students' lives. It is as if the school has fulfilled its responsibility as long as the students pay tuition and go to and from class following the bell.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in terms of skills. It is also very sad to say that we have nothing! "Reading books blindly" is the characteristic of education in our country today. Except for a few vocational schools, in school, we only know how to read lecture notes and copy notes. During the exam, if you memorize the outline well and write the answers, you will naturally get more points, and you will be considered an excellent student. As for whether you have any skills, that is not a matter of general importance!</p>
<p>How many of those engaged in education in our country today are truly enthusiastic about education? They either treat it as a charitable cause or as a tool for political party struggle; or they use the school as a base for eating. With such a spirit to deal with education, no wonder Chinese education is declining day by day! And the recent lack of prospects for intellectuals is also the result of this bad education! Although, the young students themselves are also to blame for abandoning themselves and not thinking about striving!</p>
<p>The Singer</p>
<p>Ru Hui</p>
<p>He looked around at the crowd surrounding him, his eyes filled with bleak light, and crystalline tears rolled down from the corners of his eyes; he lowered his head, and his withered black fingers trembled weakly again as he plucked the strings of the qin. The sound of the strings rang out, the desolate tone scattered in the lonely air, sobbing with sadness.</p>
<p>The crowd around him widened their eyes, watching the wandering singer; the terrifying silence revealed everyone's sour and bitter expressions, and stirred up the rhythm of human sympathy in the depths of their hearts.</p>
<p>The singer opened his hoarse throat and began to sing his sad tune in a choked voice:</p>
<p>"I have no home, I have no relatives; holding a bitter cup, drinking tears, suppressing the old qin, carrying a lonely shadow, wandering in the world all day long. I have traveled all over the world, I have tasted all the bitterness and spiciness, I no longer think of the beautiful scenery of the past,</p>
<p>I no longer pursue the lost soul;</p>
<p>I only hope that the pure soul can accompany my remaining life."</p>
<p>The singing stopped, leaving only the wailing of the qin, slowly floating in the sky; everyone was silent, their feet nailed to the ground, their eyes nailed to the singer's face, and their hearts chasing the singing that disappeared into the distance. The singer slowly raised his head, two streaks of undried tears printed on his cheeks, he stretched out his hand, asking everyone to give him something that could prolong his life.</p>
<p>The crowd wriggled, but no one was willing to drop a copper coin, they dispersed in silence. In the light waves of the setting sun, a desperate hunger staggered, holding his only friend—a qin. Embarking again on the bitter, dark "path of life."</p>
<p>Unrecoverable Youth!</p>
<p>Ya Fei</p>
<p>Where to chase back my youth; where to find my old dreams! Youth, it disappeared in an instant! Old dreams, they will never return!</p>
<p>Youth is precious, old dreams are warm; oh my lovely youth! Come back soon! Beautiful old dreams! I miss you so much!</p>
<p>When I go from childhood to adulthood, and to now; this is a process that is worth cherishing and worth remembering. However, that ruthless time! It has driven away my youth! That cruel life! It has also sent away my old dreams! Alas! I don't know in what year, month, day, or hour, I will be able to relive my childhood dreams? Childhood, when I think of childhood, I feel infinite sadness; two lines of bitter hot tears fall down unconsciously, like beads with broken threads, scattered and falling.</p>
<p>Childhood! That lovely childhood; how can you bear to abandon me? I have been with you for several years, and now you are willing to leave me and find another companion? Ah! Hateful childhood, you are too snobbish.</p>
<p>Childhood is a broken dream, even an illusory dream; a sweet illusion. Life from childhood to adulthood is an inevitable stage, and it is also a path that everyone cannot avoid.</p>
<p>The giant wheel of the era is advancing relentlessly; the elusive streamer has passed like a shuttle. Since I jumped out of the arms of my lovely慈母慈母 kind mother and threw myself into that evil whirlpool—society, I have been just spinning in the circle of life all day long; spinning, spinning non-stop.</p>
<p>Society is like a huge furnace; coal and all fuels are the environment of life, and life is the iron hammer of life. Man is a piece of iron that is being smelted in the furnace. Smelting, burning, hammering, being a person is already painful enough!</p>
<p>Now, the whip of life has struck my shoulders; heavily, heavily, striking, striking. I can only groan under this ruthless flogging. At the same time, I let out a few sharp cries of pain: but who will pity me, sympathize with me, rescue me? At this time, maybe there are still people next to me, saying mockingly, "You damned poor kid, you deserve this!" Human nature is inherently cold; especially in this realistic society full of money and power.</p>
<p>Involuntarily, I have been drifting in this sea of people for more than twenty years; but I have never found any slight comfort, except in my childhood in the past.</p>
<p>The demon of the environment, regardless of explanation, grabbed me! How can I still struggle? Although I have tried my best to struggle, I have not escaped!</p>
<p>I have already broken into the journey of life; but oh, my road ahead is covered with thorns! I only feel darkness and danger! I no longer have the courage to move forward, I can only徘徊,彷徨,恐怖 wandering, hesitating, and fearing here!</p>
<p>Now I have been judged by God, and the result of the sentence is "life imprisonment." Poor me! I don't even know what crime I committed? God is willing to let me suffer this cruel punishment: I only hope that God will come to baptize me again one day, to repent, to repent for all my past mistakes, to wipe away the污点污点 stains in my life history, hoping that he can reduce my guilt; from hell, from the sea of suffering, to save me.</p>
<p>Now, where has my youth gone? Has it taken away all my innocence, liveliness, happiness, and joy? Alas! Lovely youth! Come back soon! Beautiful old dreams! I miss you so much! I want you to come back to my side; and be a permanent happy companion with me, okay? My friends—youth—old dreams, come back soon!</p>

<p>Everyone knows that children love to play. Children's life is a kind of playful life. Games can make people develop the habit of group life and an optimistic and enterprising spirit. Singing, performing, sports, competition... are valued by modern education, and it is not accidental.</p>
<p>Not only children, we adults also love to play. In fact, we must also have the opportunity to play. Under the current畸形 society畸形 society distorted social organization, there are too many unsatisfactory things in life. If we don't seek to vent them, then our life will be unbearable. Imagine that we are煎迫煎迫 tormented by a bad environment all day long, surrounded by烦恼烦恼 troubles, with no events that arouse interest, what kind of life is that? Our 天年天年 natural span of life will inevitably be chewed up by troubles, and how tragic will our lives be! Speaking of this, I remember a story. Once a卫生家卫生家 hygienist went to ask a doctor, how can one live a long life? The doctor asked him, "Do you drink alcohol?" He said "No." "Do you smoke?" "No". "Do you have a girlfriend?" "No."! The doctor then told him that you simply have no life, why do you still want to live a long life?</p>
<p>This is almost a joke, but from this, we can get a lesson. That卫生家卫生家 hygienist thought he was very hygienic,屏叶屏叶 discarded all hobbies, thinking that this would lead to longevity.

<h3 id="e88">The Fate and Future of the League of Nations: The Success or Failure of Disarmament is Key; Hopes for Compromise Among Nations are Slim; Calls for Reform Will Likely Resurface <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has already challenged the League of Nations. In a speech on March 18th, Mussolini warned that the League's existence hinges on the disarmament issue. The League of Nations has received Mussolini's warning with mixed feelings. Most people agree with the Italian Prime Minister that if the League cannot survive the storm of disarmament, it will collapse. They declare that if the disarmament conference fails, Italy will definitely withdraw from the League, and Germany will continue to refuse to rejoin. Even the hopes of the United States and Soviet Russia joining the League will be greatly undermined, causing other countries to lose interest in the League. However, some still believe that even if the disarmament conference fails, the League will not disappear. But these people are in the minority. Moreover, these people also admit that if disarmament fails, the League will inevitably reduce its political power and prestige, and turn the League into an organization for promoting international social education. League officials privately say that the future is very bleak. There is only a glimmer of hope for the completion of any military convention. Even if the convention is fortunately established, the call for reforming the League will inevitably follow before Italy agrees to full cooperation, Germany rejoins the League, or Soviet Russia joins. The urgent goal of completing the disarmament convention is to enable Germany to rejoin the League. However, Germany will demand more concessions from France as a condition for returning to Geneva, and even demand a slight restructuring of the League. It is currently rumored that Soviet Russia will soon join the League. Although this news has not been confirmed by Moscow, according to reliable information obtained by the Associated Press, France is now making every effort to facilitate Soviet Russia's joining the League before the autumn conference. According to recent speeches and statements by Soviet Russia, Soviet Russia does not object to increasing its cooperation with Geneva. This step can indeed strengthen Soviet Russia's power against Japan. To counter the growing amity between Soviet Russia and Poland and Germany, and to gain France's full assistance, Soviet Russia may consider it necessary to join the League. However, Soviet Russia will follow the examples of Germany and Italy and will not proceed with joining Geneva until the disarmament issue is resolved. Therefore, the completion of the disarmament convention will be the price for Soviet Russia's joining the League, and it must obtain the recognition of all member states. The question of whether the League will continue to exist after the end of the disarmament conference is not ignored by people in the League. Despite Mussolini's recent criticisms of the League in the agreement signed with Austria and Hungary, there is deep sympathy here for the Italian Prime Minister's Danube policy. This is because the Stresa Conference did indeed point out a way for the economic reorganization of the pitiful Central and Eastern European countries. Only political suspicion caused the recommendations of the Stresa Conference to be abandoned. However, they believe that Mussolini's economic assistance to Austria and Hungary based on the spirit of Stresa is a great achievement. However, without the cooperation of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia, Mussolini's plan may still become a bubble. The danger lies in carrying out political conspiracies under the guise of Italian-Austrian-Hungarian economic cooperation, which displeases the Little Entente countries. If Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia suspect that the Italian Prime Minister will use his new group to promote his policy of revising the treaties for Italy and Hungary, it will trigger the danger of open conflict between two opposing groups. Conversely, if France devotes itself to befriending Italy and ignores the Little Entente, it is feared that Yugoslavia and Romania will turn to Germany. This situation has already shown signs, warning France to be cautious in choosing between Italy and the Little Entente. The League of Nations, in its detached position, observes a trend, hoping to eliminate opposing forces and achieve a lasting economic solution. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Results of the White House Three-Headed Conference: The United States Continues to Maintain a Watchful Stance on Disarmament; European Problems Must Be Solved by Themselves <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Since President Roosevelt held an important meeting with Secretary of State Hull and US Disarmament Representative Davis, it was made clear today that the US government will continue to maintain a bystander attitude regarding European disarmament decisions. The three giants reviewed the recent developments in Geneva, London, Paris, and Berlin for over two hours. At the close of the meeting, a spokesperson declared that the United States has no recommendations to make to other countries on the disarmament issue. When Davis left the White House, he told reporters that he hoped Europe could solve its own problems, but Davis indicated that if the Disarmament Conference could be convened as scheduled on May 29, he was prepared to return to Geneva. Davis concluded, "From our standpoint, whether Europe needs disarmament is for Europe to decide." Political observers view the final sentence as an indication from the United States that if countries fail to reach a mutual understanding, especially England, France, Germany, and Italy, then the United States does not want to express too much interest in disarmament. Sources close to various government circles know that the government believes that if the Franco-German deadlock caused by the negotiations in June cannot be broken, then continued efforts at disarmament will be fruitless. Official circles here feel that the recent lack of hope for compromise between France and Germany is very obvious. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is not yet known whether the United States will send personnel to participate in the meeting of the Disarmament Conference Committee on May 23. The United States is currently informally sounding out opinions from various countries. The issue of attendance will only be decided after it is certain what the opinions of the European countries are. Many important people and several American and foreign groups have already presented the disappointing situation of the Disarmament Conference to Roosevelt and told him that if the United States acts in a timely manner, it may be able to save the stalemate. Yesterday, Villard, the editor-in-chief of the very influential liberal "Nation Magazine," also led a group to see Roosevelt and asked him to take action. However, the general public in the United States is very opposed to American intervention in European disputes, which we should not forget. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since German Foreign Minister Neurath made his remarks to France yesterday, newspapers here have commented on them very little today. However, the Paris Morning Post today published a very long special dispatch from Berlin, believing that Neurath's declaration was a response to the Anglo communication addressed to France. The special correspondent stated that the most intriguing part of Neurath's declaration was the difficult hopes and anxieties displayed by Germany's general policy, as Germany's goal is to prevent the great powers from returning to Geneva, fearing that France will have surprising measures to appear in Geneva. The special reporter also said that since Italian Undersecretary Suvich visited London and Brussels, Germany's hope of a joint Anglo-Italian front against France has lost its basis. On the other hand, when the countries reconvene in Geneva in the future, France may have the possibility of pulling in Poland and Soviet Russia in addition to the Little Entente.

<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Barthou went to the capitals of Poland and Czechoslovakia yesterday to visit the leaders of the two countries and strengthen ties. His mission has now concluded, and he returned here at noon today. Political figures who came to the station to welcome him included Minister without Portfolio and former Prime Minister Tardieu, a representative of Prime Minister Doumergue, and most cabinet members. Diplomatic figures included the ambassadors of Poland, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. Barthou gave a statement, saying, "My visit to Poland and Czechoslovakia was originally for diplomatic courtesy, but I did not expect it to have such a significant political negotiation nature. After gathering and examining the impressions I have gathered, I know that the mission I bear is indeed extremely important. Our delegation (Barthou refers to himself) received sincere and friendly treatment everywhere, and there were never any misunderstandings during the talks, which is really fortunate." Barthou said that he was very satisfied with the results of his talks with Polish politicians. He said, "Various issues regarding the friendship between France and Poland and the general situation were discussed. We have established a sincere compromise, and the Franco-Polish alliance has also been revised and strengthened." Barthou went on to praise Czech President Masaryk and Foreign Minister Beneš, saying that there were no subtle issues between France and Czechoslovakia. As for the Little Entente countries, all parties are making every effort to spread destructive propaganda, but they have not been able to harm the solidarity of the Little Entente in the slightest. Their firmness and loyalty remain the same. These countries have a very good understanding of French policy and agree with it very much. With this external support, our strength is strong. Anyone who attempts to harm us, no matter how bold or cunning, we will surely be able to break their conspiracies and make them panic. What we are worried about is that we do not know what we want to do, or we know it but cannot express it well. The purpose of my trip is for peace, and now I have returned with trust and a sense of security." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>In the capital of Norway today, the Norwegian Parliament rejected the Labor Party's motion to reorganize the Norwegian military into a defense force by a vote of 67 to 66. This is also an echo of the arms race among European countries. During the parliamentary discussion of this issue, the Speaker of Parliament made an important speech, which involved the issue of disarmament. He said, "If any country dismantles its national defense capabilities and attempts to rely on faith in international coordination, then when war breaks out in the future, that country will be the first country whose territory is occupied. That country will drown in war, because it has no independent basis, and will be in a position where negotiations are ineffective. Therefore, throughout history, it is especially important today that the Norwegian military must not withdraw its defenses." (National Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Twenty-two land-based aircraft of the Marine Corps will fly from the Marine Corps base in Quantico on Sunday to participate in fleet exercises in the Caribbean Sea. This is an unprecedented large-scale squadron flight. This news was announced by the Navy Department this afternoon. The commander of the flight squadron is Major Lowell. The flight distance will reach more than 5,000 miles, flying over Cuba, Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Puerto Rico. The sea flight will also reach 800 miles. Most of these aircraft do not have the equipment to stop on the water surface, so it is a bold initiative. Major Lowell plans to arrive directly at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba on May 4. The US fleet will arrive there in the coming days. In January of this year, six US Navy aircraft completed a non-stop flight from San Francisco to Honolulu, so the Navy Department considers this flight to be a continuation of operations, and the Navy Department is gradually paying more attention to the squadron flight.

<p>According to a Tokyo dispatch from the China United News Agency, the Japanese military believes that the world crisis is gradually becoming dangerous and that war is inevitable, so it is vigorously preparing for air defense, preventing enemy countries from disrupting its rear, and vigorously promoting the civilian aviation industry. According to a survey by the Ministry of the Army, the strength of the civilian aviation industry in the five major powers is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) From an economic perspective, France is the most active in promoting civil aviation, followed by Germany. The expenses used are as follows:</p>
<p>1930 1933</p>
<p>England 7,810,720 19,853,064</p>
<p>France 54,527,341 114,452,824</p>
<p>Germany 31,935,333 69,896,338</p>
<p>United States 20,862,546 40,783,362</p>
<p>Japan 7,137,322 3,395,513</p>
<p>(2) Judging from the number of aircraft, the United States ranks first, followed by France, Germany ranks third, and Japan has the least. The numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>1931 1932</p>
<p>England 899 981</p>
<p>France 1,122 1,571</p>
<p>Germany 984 1,067</p>
<p>United States 9,818 10,780</p>
<p>Japan 147 149</p>
<p>(2) Judging from the number of pilots, the United States has the most technical talents, while Japan has the least. The numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>1931 1932</p>
<p>England 1,955 people 2,766 people</p>
<p>France 1,100 people Unknown</p>
<p>Germany 2,500 people Unknown</p>
<p>United States 16,121 people 18,594 people</p>
<p>Japan 315 people 391 people</p>
<p>Looking again at the civilian aviation industries of the three countries, the most impressive is the Soviet Union, which is closely related to Japan's national defense. A brief description is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e94">Russia <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>In the Russian aviation industry, in the two or three years after the revolution, the industry was depressed due to internal strife. Since 1921, the government has been very active in promoting it, advancing in parallel with military aviation, with a great trend of development. The civilian aviation industry, which was formerly under the jurisdiction of the National Defense Labor Conference, has been under the jurisdiction of the Federal People's Committee since 1932, and is called the Headquarters of Civilian Aviation. Civilians own more than 500 aircraft, and the budget in 1931 reached 150 million rubles. After the success of the Five-Year Plan, the number is even more staggering. Its airline routes were only 11,422 kilometers in 1928, but by 1933 there were 30,517 kilometers, and by 1936 there were 220,000 kilometers. Its progress is truly astonishing. Russia has a National Defense Aviation Association with 11 million members, who have donated more than 400 aircraft to the Red Army, and there are 24 flying schools. The aircraft factory can manufacture 10,000 aircraft annually and instill a passion for aviation in young men and women. Its progress is very rapid.</p>
<h3 id="e95">England <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>In order to connect with its territories, the United Kingdom has particularly expanded its air force. This year's budget expenditure is 663,000 pounds, expanding the power of its civilian aviation. The Imperial Airways Company was established in 1925, unifying various domestic companies, specializing in postal and transportation, and stipulating an annual subsidy of 1 million pounds for ten years, with a minimum of 40,000 miles to be flown each year. In 1929, the British Flying Business Company was established, with the government subsidizing 6,000 pounds annually, and flying clubs were established in various cities. There are a total of 1,440 clubs in the fifty territories, with more than 10,000 members.</p>
<h3 id="e96">America <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The civilian aviation industry in the United States ranks first in the world. In mid-October 1932, there were 10,780 aircraft, 18,600 pilots, and 120 flying schools. In 1931, 700,000 passengers were transported and 161,734 degrees of freight were transported. Its power is known to the world.</p>
