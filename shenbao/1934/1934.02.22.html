<h3 id="c38">英兵入侵滇邊葫蘆王地廷 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>昆明通信。去歳十二月間。英兵二千餘名。開入滇邊班弄地方。所到之處。修築道路。一般談論。謂意在急於佔領我班紅（卽班洪）之金廠。但除佔金廠外有無其他意圖。不得而知云云。滇省有李景森君者。曾爲鑛務親往班洪調查。先後二次。據其報告。班洪僻處滇邊。與永邦班老鑛别紹興等四區。同稱葫蘆王地。葫蘆王地原有上下之分。下葫蘆王所屬班况等地。在清季訂立中緬界約時。已允放棄。現所餘者僅上葫蘆王地。其地偏居滇省西南。在公明山之西北。西與英緬接壤。東界雙江。北接孟定耿馬。南隣瀾滄孟連。人口近百萬。地廣數千方里。幾及全滇面積六分之一。氣候温和。土地膏腴。物產饒多。金銀鑛產。尤稱豐富。惟人民知識甚低。蓁蓁茫茫。不知身外有物等語。</p>
<p>國人對邊疆情形。素鮮關懷。雲南天末遐荒。更視爲不足輕重。自東北陷落。朝野痛定思痛。始稍稍注意於邊防。然其目光仍多及於西北而略於西南。卽言滇省。偪處英法兩大之間。形勢危亟。不自今始。而吾人所知者江心坡片馬之淪亡。而不知猶有所謂葫蘆王地者。邊情隔暎膜。至於此極。深堪歎息。</p>
<p>今吾人敢大聲疾呼爲國人警告曰。雲南者乃印度與揚子江間之連鎖。英人之處心積慮。嘗欲自印度入雲南。貫穿四川。進窺西藏。席捲長江上遊。故其進兵江心坡片馬以及侵佔葫蘆王地。或卽爲其一貫政策之表現。昔姚文棟氏之論雲南。謂其有倒挈天下之勢。其得失實關係於全國之安危。近人閔爲人君亦云。「雲南據各省之上游。有倒挈天下之勢。由雲南入川。則據長江之上遊。過貴州至黄平沅江以達湖南。則可左右北方。若夫東走廣西。沿西江而下。則據珠江流域。」又引劉維垣之言云。「中國如瓜形雲南如瓜蒂。瓜蒂濫則全瓜濫矣。」明乎此乃知此次警耗。意義甚爲重大。而今後之對付方針。亦决當以整個的西南邊防爲眼着眼點。也吾人一本此見解。敢爲我當局建議如后。　　（一）外交方面　旣往滇邊外交糾紛之所由起。界務不明。實尸其咎。根據遜清光緒十二年（一八八六）中英緬甸條約第三欵。中緬邊界。應由中英兩國派員會同勘定。嗣後雙方派員談判。對於界務。數有修正。其關於南段界務者。光緒二十三年（一八九七）中英續約第三欵註明。自南碗河瑞麗江相會處綫。至順寗屬之耿馬孟定。循江塲與江洪之界綫而至湄江一帶。經緯詳明。斑斑可考。次年騰越鎭劉萬勝等與英領事巴維里按照原欵之規家。會勘鎭邊孟連山明山等處。不意英領竟欲擅指孔明山（南卡江與南壘江之分水嶺）爲約中之公明山（在潞江東南。滾河之南。）使界綫向東進佔。若照其言。則不惟葫蘆王地不歸我有。卽瀾滄所屬之茅壽西盟官得永廣蠻弄等地。亦將合併於緬我方以英領巧於諧聲。不顧事實。故與之力爭。結果該段界綫與北緯二十五度三十五分尖高山以北一段界綫。迄今同爲懸案。界務之劃分旣未辦妥。英人遂視爲有機可乘。此次英兵開入班弄事件。我政府速宜調查事實眞相。向英交涉。固不待論。而爲釜底抽薪一勞永逸計。尤宜急起直追。一方研究舊日劃界之約章擋案與劃界有關人員如曾紀澤薛福成姚文楝等之撰著。以爲歷史事實之根據。一方則簡派幹練人員。馳往沿邊一帶。悉心勘踏。繪成詳圖。并考核英人侵邊之沿革及現狀。以爲實行交涉之凖備。然後乃向英方催開劃界談判。庶幾有備無恐。不復有臨時掣肘之苦。界務糾紛而能解决。西南國防差可無慮。</p>
<p>（二）内政方面　外交對付之方針。不外如此。惟内政整頓。頭緒尤繁。當兹强鄰偪處之時會。自宜選擇其中犖犖大端。先行入手。然後漸推廣。吾人以爲今日爲整頓西南邊務之所急需而不容或緩者。爲（甲）實行兵士屯墾政策。此事不惟與邊防大有裨益。且爲國内冗額軍隊闢一絶大尾閭。（乙）傳播我國文字語言。使當地土著皆知爲中國苗裔。益堅其内附之心。好在土民向漢之心頗切。使其歸化内附。初不甚難。卽如李景森君報告。葫蘆王等曾云。班洪鑛山要大漢朝來開辦方可。否則必聯合各王盡力抵抗。决不輕休。此種心理大可利用。（丙）滇西人烟稀少。土地廣漠。似應另設一省。省會設於大理。行政區域旣經縮小。地方事務。可以就近辦理。在當地固無輾轉詳申之繁。在中央差免鞭長莫及之苦。又滇西土司。亦宜改爲縣治。直隷省府。以絶英人威迫利誘之謀。（丁）英人在緬邊之臘。戎八莫新街密之那等處。各有鐵路。經濟侵略。此其導線。一旦有事。運兵遣將。更爲便利。以視我方交通阻塞。邊情隔膜。不可同日而語。今爲鞏固國防及開發邊區計。築路一舉。自爲先務之急。</p>
<p>今日西南邊防之危亟。實不減於東北。吾人非敢危言聳聽。形勢如此。何可緘默。片馬江心坡旣已相繼而失。後患重重。不知伊於胡底。若就侵佔葫蘆王地而英方交涉。終不過一隅之得失。一偶之得失固所力爭。全局之安危尤宜注意。</p>

<p>（東京）衆議院查問岡本議員之查問委員會、本日上午十一時十分開第三日會議、今日因發表樺太疑獄事件之證據書類、究明鳩山文相之綱紀問題眞相、會場緊張之度愈加增大、國民同盟野田文一郎最先發言謂、</p>
<p>本委員會已經要求三土鐵相·鳩山文相·及高橋藏相出席、然未見其出席、是何理由、</p>
<p>島田委員長答、</p>
<p>政府方面已通知三相於適當時期出席委員會、</p>
<p>野田其次主張日本人造絲及神户製鋼所事件處分之不當、並詳細說明金子直吉·隅田某與三土鐵相之關係、後由政友會志賀和多利發言謂、</p>
<p>岡本君談及本人之事與事實不符合、本人未曾由鳩山文相接到關於樺太事件善後處置之報告、岡本君所提及之事、全無根據、</p>
<p>政友會森田政義待志賀言畢、要求岡本撤回其言辭、其次民政黨谷原公發言謂、岡本本君在委員會之一言一句卽爲證據、且係政治的裁判之重要材料、故希望岡本君自由發表事件眞相、余讀岡本君演說之速記錄、内中有本年發表之意、但因反駁各議員臨時發言無意中說出之言辭、岡本君被人問去年一百三十人代議士收賄事件時、有何感想、岡本答、</p>
<p>議場中因多人揶揄、且被興奮空氣支配、實有少許遺憾之點、然對余通知撒發巨欵事實之人、因憤慨本問題、且對於現欵之出所有疑惑、故有通知之舉、余亦信此事係事實、代議士一百三十人之數、或有三四人錯誤、亦未可知、谷原問、</p>
<p>岡本君關於樺太事件所承辦之事項、爲極重大之刑事事件、岡本君由鳩山文相得到何種報酬、</p>
<p>岡本答、</p>
<p>本案發生後、余時常憂悶、心狀非常不安、但未曾接到任何報酬、</p>
<p>政友會上田孝吉略帶憤慨之色、對岡本謂、</p>
<p>對於政友議員一百三十人撒發金錢之事、確有根據乎、請列舉議員姓名、</p>
<p>岡本答、</p>
<p>不能發表、</p>
<p>時至十二時半會長宣告休會、</p>
<p>查問委員會依舊爲衆人注目之焦點、於本日午後二時十五分繼續開會、當時旁聽席上忽發見文相之令弟鳩山秀夫博士亦在座、首由藤田若水氏質問、</p>
<p>岡本君身爲政友會黨員、而預存脫黨之决心、以圖暴露同僚之非、吾人對於此項行動、實覺至爲詫異、甚至疑雲萬丈、岡本君之該項心境爲何而發、尚乞加以說明、</p>
<p>岡本氏答、</p>
<p>紊亂綱紀至爲可慮、故予曾於一月二十日以書面請求鈴木總裁設法肅清綱紀也、</p>
<p>藤田又問、</p>
<p>在過去之岡本君曾經旣與鳩山君同犯湮没證據、復行懺悔而出以肅清綱紀　　之舉、而今是否更有所圖而出此耶、</p>
<p>岡本答、</p>
<p>予决無故意傷害他人之圖、</p>
<p>藤田聲稱、</p>
<p>取締紊亂綱紀者固屬應當、而無故敗壞他人之名譽、亦非熱血人類所應爲、所謂一百三十人受領鳩山氏所給與之金錢云云、是否道聽途說、故作針小棒大之誇張、</p>
<p>此時乃由島田委員長宣讀辯明書、</p>
<p>頃已接到政友會之猪野毛利榮氏（岡本君所謂聞諸其說之人）來函、關於岡本氏之發言、毫非事實、業已辯明矣、</p>
<p>宣讀之後、適足以證明岡本所說全屬虚搆、又所謂提出圖表之窪井義道氏亦來函、要求取消岡本君之發方、並宣讀該項來件、復由各委員追究岡本、</p>
<p>岡本君所謂有約在先、未便說出之人物、請說出該項姓名、</p>
<p>次由民政黨之武富氏要求提出關於台灣銀行股票處分問題之文件、此時島田委員長乃宣稱、</p>
<p>對岡本君質問案、大致可告完結、現當查問江藤源九郎君、但所餘時間甚少、可於下次執行、</p>
<p>小山法相亦於此時作簡單之發言、四時五分宣告散會、（二十一日日聯電）</p>

<p>北伐成功、尤其是九一八事件發生以後、國人對邊疆建設、注意者日多、自國家前途言之、能不謂爲良好現象乎、第國人目光、顧視不週、注意西北、而未及於西南、尤未重視界於兩大之雲南、又以雲南邊地情形而論、一般人士、亦有偏畸、只知道江心坡片馬之淪亡、而不知道偏居西南之葫蘆王地、已陷於危險界中、亦鑛產豐富、土地肥沃之區、斯不能不引以爲憾也、</p>
<p>葫蘆王地、原有上下之分、下葫蘆王所屬班况等地、因當局颟頇、於訂立界約時、已允劃歸英緬、現所餘者、僅上葫蘆王地耳、其地偏居本省西南隅、在公明山的西北、西與英緬接壤、東界雙江、北接孟定耿馬、南隣瀾滄孟連、地廣數千方里、人口近百萬、氣候温和、圭地沃腴、物產豐富、金銀鑛產尤多、惟人民知議甚低、蓁蓁茫茫、不知身外有物、飲食尚有茹毛飲血、居住亦不乏穴居野處者、依然原始狀態也、</p>

<p>甲人民　（一）人口約有一百萬、因地近熱帶、氣候温和、物產豐富、人口繁殖頗速、如哨辛（卽紹興）王境内天氣較好、物產較豐、人口增加較各王境内爲甚、約有五十萬左右、班洪王境、約三十萬、其他如班老、用半（卽永邦）、鑛别三土境内、各有五六萬人、都是散居山中、過那半農半獵的生活、（二）種族、是地人民、是上古時代三苗九黎荆蠻南蠻的後裔、亦蒙古利亞種之一、全境内分　的都是苗族的濮曼人名爲卡瓦、面方頸長、皮色黄褐、性質粗簡、實有上古野蠻民族的風氣、同歷史上所述的原始人民的生活一様、（三）性質、人民性質、直率簡陋、　梗愚鈍、進步很遲、又因喜好狩獵、養成殘忍的性情、没有人敢同他們來往、無形中與漢人劃了一條極大的鴻溝、减少了開化的機會、</p>
<p>乙土地　（一）位置、居本省西南邊地、東界雙江南連瀾滄孟連、北接耿馬孟定、西與英屬緬甸接壤、當中緬兩國往來之衝、實雲南之重鎭也、（二）面積、面積約數千方里、東西長千里、南北廣七百餘里、幾有雲南六分之一、哨辛約五千方里、班紅約二千方里、鑛别二千方里、班老、用半各千餘方里、（三）地勢、公明山接怒山脈餘勢、雄踞中央、高七千米突左右、支脈分五條、互相連絡環繞哨辛東部的黑山、又由黑山分支西行、綿亘七百餘里、直入金廠壩、接聯金銀鑛產豐富的大山、再由大山分支南下到浪滄土司猛角董境、有居高臨下之勢、北支山脈由北行接聯耿馬的三尖山、全境構成一大高原、山勢崎嶇、横延千里、公明山之東有南卡河、南壘河流入緬甸、水勢湍急、不便行船、西有薩爾温江、亦流入緬甸、北有南丁河滾弄江、流入薩爾温江内、水勢洶湧、形勢險要、</p>
<p>丙氣候　地當北緯一十三度内、已入熱帶、然因大山横延、高聳雲際、地勢高下不一、故寒温熱的氣候都兼有、平原深谷内、地勢低下、氣候炎熱、潮濕亦多、烟瘴特别利害、山地則空氣温和儼然温帶情况、若夫高山之上、則常常積雪、非常嚴寒、至於暴風迷霧、因地勢的關係、也常常發生、</p>
<p>丁交通　境内因大山聳立、綿延横亘、森林密茂、遮萌天日、又少與外人來往、路政無由談起、所以烏道崎嶇、曲曲如羊腸、人馬不易通過、交通非常梗阻、河流雖多、但因地勢高下不一、水流湍急、不便航行、只能供土人做漁業之用、</p>
<p>戊礦物　（一）金屬類、境内金屬鑛物、蘊藏特别豐富、質量最佳、幾有山山皆是、通地都有的情形、可算甲於全國的金銀區域了、兹分述於下、（銀鑛）銀鑛產於黑山之西、大尖山之下、爲班洪班老、用半三王的交界處、鑛區南北百餘里、東西七八十里、鑛苗壘積、　山皆是、每年被風雨剝削、流入溪谷内的非　之多、如遇山谷崩壞、鑛石出現、眞有取之不盡、用之不竭的情形、鑛質甚爲優良、舊年英人盜取化騐、亦謂鑛質甚佳、這様豐富的鑛苗、良好的鑛質、任其委棄於地、眞是可惜、（金鑛）金鑛產於哨辛以下黑山之間、山中有河一條、夾着很多的金沙、直流入金廠壩、是河因產金沙、故又名金沙河、每年王子准人民淘金沙三天、就可得半年的用費、金鑛豐富的情形、也可想見了、其他如銅鑛·鐵鑛·銻鑛·錫鑛·鎳鑛等、各處皆有、通地皆是、實在是金銀珍寶、蘊藏豐富之區、可惜政府没有注意開發、不能地盡其利、（二）非金屬類、班紅境内、除了金屬鑛物蘊藏豐富之外、非金屬鑛物、也是特别豐富、卽如煤鑛、產於金廠壩之西、鑛區綿延數百里、土人因柴草甚多、尚未取用、其他各種原料、亦特别的多、至於寶石之類、五光十色、光彩耀目、更非内地人士所曾見、</p>
<p>已動物　班紅因地近熱帶、氣候温和、各種動物、較之内地、特别强大、不論家畜野生、都高大肥潤、兹分述家畜與野生兩種動物於下、（一）家畜類、人民因過半農業半遊牧的生活、對於家畜亦多畜養、兹就其性質分爲二種、一·與人同住的、有鷄·犬·豕·三種、鷄佔百分之七、犬佔百分之一、豕佔百分之六、直接由人以小麥、旱谷、包谷等豢養、蓄於家中、二·不與人同住的、有黄牛·水牛·綿羊·山羊·馬·騾·驢等、黄牛最多、佔全數百分之二十五、水牛佔百分之八、山羊佔百分之二十、綿羊佔百分之十、馬佔百分之十、騾佔百分之十、驢佔百分之十、上列畜類、雖爲家畜、實似野生、日夜食臥於山中、與野獸無異、人民欲用時、就像獵取野獸一般、（二）野生類、野生的各種動物、也是屬於熱帶產物、卽如象·虎·豹·彪·態·鹿·麂·山驢·野牛·野豬之類、象則產於班紅境和用半兩地、共二十餘條、虎豹彪熊等則沿江邊一帶、日夜常常出現、至於鹿·麂·野牛·野豬等、則各地皆有、人民獵取、以供食物、又鳥類則有也孔雀·雉·鸚鵡·鴛鴦等、毛羽華美、顏色鮮艷、奇奇怪怪、種類很多、</p>
<p>庚植物　（一）樹木類、境内植物、多半是熱帶的產物、與内地不同、深山樹木、竟有大十餘圍、高數十丈者、至數圍大樹、遍山皆是、不可勝計、種類複雜、難以枚舉、其中最著名的、則有杠樹、九漿、子栢、納　杠、樁、招等、生畏最速、年可長一丈、闊一尺、深谷中則有大豆樹、及老鴉枕頭樹、亦特别高大、土人取其實、以爲食物、其殻似盒、可盛物和做小兒的玩具、（二）果木類、果木以楷杷、葡萄、麻梅果、黄果、芭蕉等爲著、味極甜美、清香可口、然均爲野生、很少家植、其他桃李杏等、完全没有、（三）花草類、境内奇花異草、遍地都是、花多鮮美長大、種類極多、見者稱奇、甚有終年不凋的鮮花、更是内地少見的東西、草類頗多、不勝枚舉、著名的則有芳草、斬劍草、大匹草三種、極其繁盛、其桿大如杯、葉多漿汁、用以飼養牲畜、極易肥潤、（四）谷物類、谷類以旱谷、包谷兩種爲大宗、其次則有小麥小米、此間種種簡便、而收獲豐富、每年二月内、將樹木砍伐、乾後以火焚燒、隨種隨出、不經艾薙、至五六月間、就可以得很好的收穫了、</p>
<h3 id="c97">二經濟狀况 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>甲農業　葫蘆王境内、氣候温和、土地肥沃、農事極易、但因人民營半游牧之生活、多注重牧畜和佃獵的工作、種植的事業、尚居附屬地位、牧畜和佃獵、反爲主要事業、兹述當地農業狀况如下、（一）種植業、種植事業、因天時地理的關係、以簡單的耕作、卽能得到很好的收成、其種植之物、以旱谷、包谷、小米、小麥等爲大宗、種植的方法、每年一月間將樹木密茂、野草叢生的地方、先行砍伐、曝後、用火焚燒、稍加人工、將土質弄鬆、於三月間、播種其上、不經艾薙、無須鋤剷至七八月間、卽能得到豐收、一人隨便種植、卽可供數人之用、因此土人多不以種植爲主業、每年農產只能敷用、很少贏餘、其地人民、又因處於各王壓迫之下、賦稅甚重、種植所餘的、都被抽收、且每當種植之際、人民都要集合來、把王子的種植完畢後、才能自已種植、因此、一般人民、無暇耕種、亦不願多事種植、故雖處於氣候土質佳美的地方、而稼穡反形衰落、（二）牧畜業、境内氣候炎熱虎草木暢茂、又因大山横亘、樹林密茂、牧畜事業、特别發達、不論牛、羊、馬、驢、騾等、出產都很多、人民以之爲主要食品、輸出境外者亦多、但是在某王子所轄地内的牲畜、都爲王子所獨有、他人都不能來境獵取、就是他的人民所食的、也是王子所賜、人民不能私有、各地牲畜、常年生息於山林、儼似野生動物、這眞是以大地爲大牧塲了、（三）佃獵業、人民除了種植和牧畜兩種事業外、主要的尚有佃獵業、人民於工作完畢的時候、不論男女、都拿着刀槍和網罟標杆、到山中獵取鳥獸、或到水邊漁魚、上至王子、下至人民、都喜歡操此事業、所以養成一種殘忍的性質、</p>
<p>乙工業　其地人民、至今尚係原始時代的生活、又因動物豐富、衣食住等、容易解决、無須另求謀生之術、工業自然談不到了、現在所有的工業只是極簡單的手工業、如麻織編竹等、其中著名的工業、只有墊單名爲卡瓦輩類的一種麻織物、長六尺、寛三尺、繳工非常簡單、土人以此披於身上、以當衣服、至於他們所用的各種器具、都楚向邊地漢人購取、他們的工業、還是在原始狀態之中停頓着、</p>
<p>丙商業　其地因爲交通不　、風氣野蠻外人多不敢深入其境、只就邊地交易罷了、境内的商業、非常零落、兹將各情分述如下、一、對外交易、每年分兩季、三月和十月間、人民出外到土司地耿馬、猛角董、孟甸、和英屬緬甸邊界麻栗壩一帶、和漢人、回人、緬人、擺夷奔弄等人交易、輸出的是大宗的鴉片、紫梗等類、多不用秤量、以目估計、非常簡單、與人交易、最守信用、如與人訂貨、則以木刻爲憑、雖經數年之久、如再相遇、則所訂之貨、不論腐朽、仍然留存、這眞是「言而有信」的交易了、對外貿易、其中介多爲貨幣、貨幣有法洋英洋中銀等項、近年以來、各王吸收銀幣甚多、然殊少用途、故多埋藏地下、二、對内交易、内地交易、因漢人多不敢深入、只有純土人入内交易、又因無市集之設、故各村落間、隨地都可交易、以以物易物的方式、將鹽、茶、油、糖、布織物類、草織物類、鐵銅器等、換所產的鴉片和紫梗牲畜等、内地交易、女子較多、頗重信義、目極公允、而手續亦非常簡單、完全是原始的社會生活、物物交換的時代、</p>
<h3 id="c98">三生活狀况 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>一語言　境内人種純粹、異族雜居者甚少、故語言尚屬統一、其中雖略有分别、也只是熟蕃語與生蕃語兩種分别、兹就其所說數目字之讀法、比較於下、</p>
<p>漢語　（一）（二）（三）（四）（五）（六）（七）（八）（九）（十）</p>
<p>熟蕃語抵　拉吕捧丙乃巧歹典　　稿</p>
<p>生蕃語體　拉力奔免楞也太天　　可</p>
<p>觀上熟蕃語與生蕃語兩種、都是大同小異、清濁之分、實在没有多大差别、境内所通行的、和外人交際的語言、多以熟蕃語爲主、外人欲入其境、非學此種語言、不能入境、又因没有文字的產生、外人多不易學習、這也是不進化的一大原因乙風俗　（一）婚娶血統之分不嚴、除了已身親姊妹之間、不能發生夫妻關係外、其他家族中的堂姊妹等、隨便配偶、任意成婚不論男女、成長至十七八歲時、互相跳舞和歌唱、如能情投意合、卽發生肉體的關係、以故未成正式夫妻時、卽產生小孩子的、非常之多、發生肉體關係後、男子和女子、若都能互相親愛、戀戀不捨時、男子先把女子隱匿他處、纔請同伴（卽内地之媒妁）、和女家說明、若許可則先聚會、以飲茶爲定婚之禮、待生子育女之後、才行正式的結婚、以吃肉爲禮、堂結婚時、男女家賓客、各帶有獸肉一二兩、作爲饋送之禮、大家圍着吃完所帶來的肉類後、方纔罷休、這様、就成了一對正式的夫婦、這眞是自由戀愛婚姻了、（二）喪葬、喪葬儀式、非常簡單、凡人死、都以爲是天所不容、恐連累他人、隨死隨葬、不令久置、人死後用竹簾一塊、周圍裹住、抬埋土中、並没其他手續、也没有任何祭禮、（三）交際、人民多以木刻爲交往信據、不論買賣田地和其他交易、都以木刻代契、如甲買乙的田地、則以木一塊、刻有花紋和鳥獸之形、長約五寸許、剖爲兩半、賣者一半、當衆焚燬、作爲永遠杜絶根源、買者收存一半、作爲契紙、交易亦用此主法、各存一半、作爲信據、以後相會、卽可認識、因此、不論各種交際、都用此爲憑證、漸漸成了一種風俗、</p>
<p>丙宗教　（一）拜物境内地勢巍峨、山林密茂、人民又以佃獵爲生、以故多崇拜山川樹木、各村落都蓄有大樹一林、名曰「龍樹」、土人對於龍樹内的一草一木、都不能亂取、若間或取着、偶害了病、卽以爲龍樹作怪、每年於春秋兩季、屬虎之日、宰牛或羊以爲祭禮、於祭祀日起五日内、更不許任何人通過龍橋、以表迴避、免觸神怒、（二）祭鬼、祭鬼又名做鬼、凡人發生疾病、都以爲是鬼作崇、約能做鬼的人十餘個、到河邊或路邊、聯代病的人、跪在地上、大家念起咒語、把米四方亂洒、說些告鬼的話、殺牛和羊各一條、以爲祭品、（三）祭旱谷、人民每於春秋二季、播種和收谷的時候、派人到外面、來拿漢人和擺夷等的人頭、回去祭旱谷、殺人頭愈多愈善、尤以鬚髮特長的人爲最好、如外人不易拿時、則野土人也要來到邊地來捉拿純土人來做祭品、因此、春秋二季、很少人同他們來往、又祭祀時、將人頭掙入長桿上、栽於旱谷田内、把鄰近人民傳齊、每人拿着茶、米、銀等、前來祭祀、大家跪着哭泣一塲、將帶來的東西、塞入人口内、哭着說、「你爲找錢米來到我們地方、被殺來祭旱谷、你生不得吃、又不得見你的父母妻子朋友、所以多給你些錢米吃、望你升天、保佑我們的旱谷、得到豐收、」祭完後、又將人頭抬到别地方祭祀、若别處也殺得人頭回來、這就留由野獸吃了、以表示人頭升天、可望旱谷得到豐收、這様殘酷的祭祀、成了永不能改的風氣了、（四）其他、近來間有效緬甸一帶、建築寺院、崇奉佛教者、於當地文化、不無影響、又近年英人派教士來邊地學習土語、深入宣傳、也有一部份人民崇拜、這是值得十分注意的事體、</p>
<p>丁教育　境内人性野蠻、不知教育爲何物、僅有班紅王境内貴族的幾個少爺太子、由邊地土司地方、請求和尚、教授幾句經書而已、</p>
<p>戊生活　（一）衣服、衣服多用棉或麻織成之布、極粗糙簡單、僅純土人縫爲服裝、用以遮身、至於野土人則多赤身露體、通體漆黑、不論男女、只用一二尺　住生殖器、形態極其難看、與獸類無異、（二）飲食、飲食多生吞活啖、純土人近雖稍知煮食、亦只隨便熱透而已、至於野土人則不知烹飪、　生米、食生肉、很少煮熟纔吃的、其尤怪者、肉類必擱至生臭氣、才算得味美氣香、食料以旱谷、包谷、小米、生姜、辣子等爲主、尤嗜茶酒、不論貧富、每日必飲茶五六次、每次數碗、嗜酒如命、多成羣緒隊、至耿馬猛角董等土地司地方交易、易酒而食、醉臥於地者、隨處可見、至於飲生羊和生牛之血、或以飯類濺血而食的、更是令人見了嘔吐、他們身體健全抵抗力强、也許是生活養成的、（三）住居、因氣候炎熱、平地不能居住、屋舍多建築於高山之上、形式極其簡單、完全都是茅屋、有蓋成樓閣式様的、通稱展樓、蓋在地面上的、呌茅草舖、屋頂有突出一尺長的兩塊架板的、就表示是他們的王府了、其他平民們都不能倣此、屋舍遍山皆是、很少聚處、（四）睡眠、不論王子和平民、都是於房屋中間、設一火塘、夜間睡眠、不分界限、父母兄弟姊妹妻子、共同團團圍繞火塘睡眠、所以境内多有殺害之事、亂倫之行、</p>
<h3 id="c99">四政治狀况 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>甲社會組織　境内人民、雖尚在游牧時期、無資本家及地主之可言、但貴族與平民間、已有階級的分化、統洽者卽壓迫階級也、各階級的人民、對於統治階級、都要絶對服從、否則、上層階級、卽施斬殺之權、其社會組織、擬表於下、</p>
<p>大王子　各王子　各糧長</p>
<p>各伙頭　各伯長　各</p>
<p>管事　人民</p>
<p>觀此可知階級之多、人民所受壓迫之重、人民每遇上層階級的人、都要行跪拜大禮、上層階級的森嚴、可想而知、</p>
<p>乙政治行施　（一）政權、政權操於各王手中、對於所屬境内、不不財賦、兵備、審判、懲罰、奬賞、發號施令等等、他人不能過問、盡在王子掌中、而王子又是世襲的、人民世世代代都是奴隷、至各王之於總王、（卽紹興王）除三年朝拜一次以外、也就更没有其他事情了、（二）政令、因爲没有文字、王子政令欲行使境内、和人民呈報等事、都是以木刻爲憑、不論休只、只要有上級的命令、和遇上級頭目時、都要行最敬的跪拜禮、至於境内如有緊急事務發生、欲召集全鐘人民時、則以吹牛角爲集合人民的號令、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c208">讀書指導：社會科學的初步讀法（二） <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>一·關於請教朋友時「因他們受了現社會各社會學派學理的影響，見解又不一致，介紹書日也不相同。一這是無足怪的。這不僅是因他受了學派的影響，也是他的將　的社會生活决定他接受了某一　派，　　了某　學派。間時，你自已也是一様，你愛吃甜的呢？這是鹹的？這要依憑你的口胃。别人無論說得天花亂　，你是不會相信他的，所謂「越把我弄得莫明其妙」者。不過，你　未將各色東西的味道嘗清，如果你稍具辦别的能力，你就不會作此浩歎了。（關於認識正確的理論，辦别學派的眞僞，請參見一月十日本欄一學說的紛紜與正確理論的把握」一文的倒數第一段。此地不贅述。）</p>
<p>二·你的朋以要你先把「經濟學弄清楚，這就一般說是正確的。經濟學是社會科學的中心科學。不過，我還不深知你的程度，這答案對於你是否適用，似乎也還是問題。如果你簡直連社會科學槪論的基礎知識也没有，要馬上研究經濟學也會要遇着非常的困難。研究經濟學以前，自然還需要做一點凖備工作。你應略具一些唯物辯證法的基礎知識，熟習一點經濟現象主面的情事。不然，你對於經濟學上所這用的方法，會更要使你頭昏，眼花。看了它裏面所討論的問題，不免覺得乾燥無味。你不懂經濟學上的方法論，你不懂經濟學研究的邏輯的順序，你就不能了解它的奥義，更何况你還對它感覺乾燥乏味呢？</p>
<p>同時，你的朋友提出的讀書順序，也還有討論的地方。譬如，將經濟學弄清楚了再去研究法律，政治這是對的，至於把史地列在最後去讀，這簡直是邏輯的倒置。史地是讀社會科學以前必具有的知識，是研究社會科學的手段，應把他放在前頭，方爲合理。</p>
<p>三·如果就一般尚未入社會科學之門的讀者而言，我們覺得，讀書的順序應改變爲：先讀一本世界史，一兩册中外地理。略備一點史地知識。然後開始讀一册社會科學槪論的書，略爲知道一點社會科學全體的槪念。繼續再讀經濟學初步的書，一步一步向經濟學這門去作深刻的研究。等到經濟學有了基礎的知識了，再去研究什麽是法律，什麽是國家，什麽是道德，什麽是藝術分讀這類的書。這是一條道路。</p>
<p>這條道路在邏輯上是很正確的，但人類生活有時也固意要違背邏輯。有些人祇高興聽甜蜜的歌，却聽不懂「陽春白雪」的曲。這有什麽辦法呢。在社會科學門前徘徊而又遠避了的人眞是多而又多，他們怕難，「太乾燥乏味了啊」，但又没有方法去制服這難，退回去的人固然苦悶，但在教育者方面却是一種更大的失敗。我們應克服這「難」，於是我現在提出另一條道路了。</p>
<p>這條路是專爲站在社會科學門前畏難而不得其門而入的人而闢的，凡已陞堂入室的人，你繼續邁進好了，不要回轉身來，改變你的旅程啊！</p>
<p>這條路是頗易走的，就是平常只愛讀讀小說的人，如果按照這條路走去，也一定不會感覺乾燥無味，不太吃力，而一様可達到社會科學的堂奥。</p>
<p>首先，我們選選讀物是軟性的「傳」，卽先讀第一流社會科學家革命者等的傳記，傳不獨給你文學上的舆趣，它還給你研究社會科學的方法，展示你作學問應如何的艱辛，增加你自學的勇氣，打退了，羞死了你自已的怯懦，使你的人不知不覺間受到伺化，感應，無形中你的字典中會再找不到一個「難」字。</p>
<p>繼續「傳」·再讀一本革命史，這是很熱鬧的書，看了你還想看，你在這中間，也可知道一點人類過去的變革，得到許多經騐，啓示你人類的將來。這也是一般的人都應讀的書。</p>
<p>在這以後，你可先讀一本社會問題大綱的書，知道一點現社會上發生過一些什麽事；讀一本社會運動史，知道一些過去現在的人們對於這些社會問題在那裏作如休解决的打算。你然後再讀本社會進化史，知道一些社會進化的法則，到了這時，你一定要感覺不滿足。你雖然知道了許多史事，却缺乏探討這些史實的因果法則，能力的你自然要進而作較根本的研究。你眞具有了决心的話，這時你回轉頭來翻閱一兩本社會科學大綱的書。同時向哲學（指　物辯證法），經濟學方面去進攻。在哲學方面你可取得不僅研究經濟學的方法，你還可取得認識宇宙社會全部的手段。在經濟學方面，自然你取得的應是解剖資本主義社會經濟構造的一切知識。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c210">上海的不合理化 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 諷</p>
<p>現代人說話，當然要帶些現代的氣味，於是「不景氣」，「科學化」，「合理化」，等一類的新名詞，便常在那些摩登士女的口角上流動着，尤其是在上海，更是到處可以聽得到。但是我們冷眼觀看，上海社會上的一切情形，却偏是最不合理化，最不科學化，而不景氣的暴露，也是最顯着！</p>
<p>我們姑置不科學化和不景氣於不論，單把上海的一切不合理化的情形來分析一下：</p>
<p>譬如廢歷新年，照理說，像上海這様一處文化開通，飽染洋氣的地方，應該總是很冷落的了：然血事實恰好相反，像槍聲一般的鞭砲，足足放了六七天，至今還不曾停止，游戲塲，戲院，旅館也是天天宣告客滿，種種的熱閙，更比内地多上幾倍。馬路上，穿洋裝的小夥子在拱手，從外國回來的博士先生們在喊恭喜；虹廟裏，有常在百樂門跳舞塲上出現的摩登小姐在燒香……</p>
<p>又如上海號稱中國文化策源地，國立，私立的大學開了許許多多：從望平街上分發出去的申報，新聞報遍行各地，差不多就可稱是中國的代表報紙。照理說，上海人的看書看報的興趣，一定是非常濃厚的了；可是據我所知道，上海儘多球迷，戲迷，鴉片烟鬼，賭鬼，却獨缺「書獃子」！某書局的大廉價，一塊錢可以買三斤半新書；某書局過年，把簇新的文學書以五元一擔的代價批給同行，同行買了，還說是看他們老板的面子！</p>
<p>又如兒童國貨年，婦女國貨年，××國貨宣傳週，差不多整年的在上海鬧着，那末，不消說，東洋貨是絶對没有人買的了；可是事實告訴我們，東洋貨最好的市塲還是上海！</p>
<p>又如洋行上海最多，洋裝同志也是上海最多，洋話也是上海人說得最多，照理說，中國的一切陳舊的東西，在上海應該是淘汰得罄盡無遺了；然而上海人偏是最迷信，拆字起課的可以在上海發財，城隍廟靜安寺，虹廟的收入可以超出内地一個縣政府的收入幾倍以上；而且踴躍捐輸者儘多受過高等教育的人，和天天在寫文章，主張改良社會的大思想家！</p>
<p>當然，上海的不合理化的現象，决不止只有我在上面所舉出的幾端。好在多是極顯而易見的，我就不必多寫了。</p>
<h3 id="c211">大掃除茸餘 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>一様的時間，一様的月日，到了廢歷年底，自有一種說不出的忙碌來。便是各家人家，都幹着「送灶」「大掃除」「謝年」「守歲」……種種庸人自擾的儍事情。官廳儘自禁止，各家照舊舉行。</p>
<p>年底所幹的事情，還是「大掃除」比較的有意思。因爲一家屋子裏，總有不少的塵灰和垃圾。日常雖也在打掃着，也許有不周到的地方。到了年底，大大的掃除一下，蛛絲鼠糞，破瓶碎碗，一掃而光。換上了新名詞，便是「清潔運動」，豈不好聽而又時髦嗎！</p>
<p>房子裏掃除一下，多少總覺得舒服一些。便拿個人來講，生了滿身的瘡疥，爬搔都不暢快，滾燙的池子裏泡一泡，何等舒適，監獄中的囚犯，蟣蝨滿頭，垢汚遍體。一出了牢門，趕緊剃頭洗澡，才　得　復了健樂。這「大掃除」的意義，　　　邊所說的差不多。</p>
<p>可　　　　門　掃除屋内的汚穢，能清潔身上的　　，内心的惡濁，險毒貪鄙邪淫，不知用甚麽方法掃除得盡。醫藥儘管發達，花柳的病毒，好注射六○六；喉管的腐爛，好注射血清。惟有内心的病毒和腐爛，竟没有法想。</p>
<p>再看看世界的舞台上，有許多地方是戰雲密布；有許多地方是失業恐慌；也有閙着政治不安定，也有鬧着社會的不景氣，這種種可以掃除得盡嗎？再小一些看到我們所處的社會裏，鴉片賭博性的交易·綁票·搶刦·强姦……這許多的汚點，可能掃除得盡嗎？</p>
<p>掃除掃除，畢竟是人們粉飾門面的一句好看話，你能掃除外表的汚穢，可能掃除内心的惡濁嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c212">鷄零狗碎 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 兪友清</p>
<p>癸酉是鷄年，甲戍是狗年，正合了鷄狗衆生，弄得紛擾不堪，我們的中國，也許像鷄零狗碎一般的可憐了。</p>
<p>本來鷄是有五德，狗是有義氣，都是人所喜愛的家畜，不過鷄飛上了屋，狗到了晩上夜哭，人家就以爲不祥了。但是孟嘗君幸虧了，鷄鳴狗盜的食客，方才能安然脫離函谷關。</p>
<p>「牝鷄司晨」，是形容婦人的執權，這種事情，本來是不合宜的。因爲從前的婦女，都是屈伏在男子的手下，做了玩弄物。幾千年來没有更變過，但是到了現在，是不對的了。提高女權，男女解放的呼聲，一天高一天，差不多現在的男子，一變而爲妝台的走卒了，也許牝鷄司晨成了事實呢！</p>
<p>「蜀犬吠日」，這也是一句形容過火的話，照字面上說：四川的犬，見了太陽，要狂吠的。因爲四川多山，難見天日，所以蜀犬要見日狂吠了。這是表示坐井觀天，所見者小的意思，也許上海人說别地的人，少精門檻，謂之曲死，阿木林，然而掉句文言，也可說是蜀犬吠日了。</p>
<p>「鷄犬升天」，這就是一人有福，大家都享的意思，現在許多有權威的人，一旦得志了，那末他的父黨母黨妻黨，這三黨人物，都可靠了他一人享福，這是何等的幸運呀！所以小百姓想出頭，試問他有没有娘舅妹夫的大亨？唉！不用說了。</p>

<p>— 妙神</p>
<p>近來廣播電臺，可稱盛極一時；不過新所用波長，大都在長波方面。且電力除中央廣播電臺之外，最大原不過五百瓦特。因此播音遠程，祇及東南　省。現在本埠國際電臺新建一短波廣播電臺，電力有兩萬五千瓦特之巨，共播音遠程，可達全世界。聞日前試騐播音，得倫敦方面之報告，謂發音清晰響亮，效力極佳云。</p>
<p>該臺内容，外界知者頗少。予承該臺工程師之請，一度前往參觀播音室，覺裝飾富麗，海上各播音室，無出其右。播音機及一切另件，皆英國馬可尼公司出品，播音機設在眞茹，播音室設在本埠沙遜大厦，用遥控制聯絡，予僅參觀播音室，至眞茄機器，因路遠未往。　　播音室完全採用東方宫殿室之裝飾，並參酌美術之圖案。屋頂飾以金色及紅色，並有金龍等之點綴，四面皆以書畫，嵌置牆上，其佈置之方法，别具匠心，又不類純粹之東方式，因在鋼骨水泥之房屋中，又運用不少科學之設施。在播音時，因欲避免回聲，四壁用絲絨遮蓋，地上用極厚之毛毯舖墊，聞祇絲絨與地毯兩項，價達三千餘元之巨。播音室中電燈，狀如宫燈，完全以玻璃製成，狀頗美麗。</p>
<p>近日每在晚間八九時起，常試騐播音，波長二十六公尺，於二月三日正式播音。惟此臺並非完全娛樂性質，如本埠欲與倫敦方面通話，祇須付相當費用，均可照辦，蓋爲一商業性的長途無綫電話也。</p>

<p>酌酒傳餐狂歡含别涙</p>
<p>挑燈　夢低唱度長更</p>
<p>桂枝笑道：统共是二兩酒，你一口就喝了半杯，以後咱們光吃菜嗎？你大槪還没有聽過我唱小曲兒，我唱一段你聽聽罷。自强笑着望了他道：你會唱，我還眞不知道呢。你會唱什麽小曲兒？桂枝笑着將頭一扭道：唱是會唱幾支，可是我又怕老太爺聽見了會說我？自强笑道：你就低低的唱也行呀。我和你抱了桌子角坐着，反正你怎様的低聲唱，我也聽見。桂枝端起酒杯子來，聞了一聞。想作一個要喝的様子。可是剛近口邊，又把酒杯子放下來，笑道：我不唱罷，唱得不好，讓你見笑，自强見要唱是他，怕唱也是他，可不知怎様的向下說好。於是端了杯子，只管向他微笑。在這時，那遠遠更聲，又隨着風向耳朶裏送將進來。桂枝搶着笑道：我還是唱罷。不過小曲兒不雅，我唱大戲你聽，好嗎？自强笑道：你還會唱大戲嗎：那更好了。你唱那一路角色的。桂枝笑道：亂七八糟，什麽我也會唱兩句。最拿手的，要算是楊貴妃醉酒。自强由桌子角邊，伸過一隻手來，輕輕的拍着他的手背道：這齣戲就很好，你就唱這個罷。而且，我也正醉着呢。桂枝聽說，眞個輕輕咳嗽了兩聲，然後帶了笑容，低低的唱了起來。他口裏唱着，耳朶可向外邊聽去，聽聽這街上的更聲，是不是打遠了。直待更聲一點都不聽到了，他才把唱停止。（三一八）</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3 id="c215">廢曆年頭的蘇州 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 吳門殺羽</p>
<p>我國確是個保古的國家，廢曆廢到現在，習俗相沿，依然根深蒂固，積重難返；爆竹聲聲，臘鼓喧喧，裝出一派太平景象。蘇州在道廢曆年頭，當然有許多「年仍舊規」，循例舉行，現在寫了出來，也是一種風土小誌。</p>
<p>燒頭霄</p>
<p>拜佛燒香的迷信舉動，政府雖早三令五申，明文禁止；但禁者自禁，幹者自幹，早變做紙上空談的官様文章。在香烟很重的蘇州，不要說舊式婦女，就是摩登姑娘，智識份子，也都在郡偶像座下，僕僕膜拜。在元旦和除夕啣接的午夜，元妙中的三清殿上，在那六十尊星宿座前，早已燭影摇紅，香靄飄拂，許多善男信女，人影幢幢的膜拜起伏。這種星宿香，俗例相傳，燒得愈早，一年開始就可愈早得到福祿。因此一班想早交好運的人，就坐以待旦，趕燒頭香，尤其是北里鶯燕，包車成陣，脂馥粉　，和殿上的香烟紅燭，交組成氤氳的濃厚氛圍。兜喜神方</p>
<p>吉利是人人喜歡討的，那班明達君子，更需趨吉避兇；所以在一元復始的元旦日，先須揀查黄曆通書，喜神何方，財神何方，然後出得門來，有所趨從。這種兜喜神方的，在現代還是大有其人。</p>
<p>橄欖茶</p>
<p>現在雖已盛行了花花綠綠的鈔票，現洋也在天然　淘汰的公例裏，然而民間對於（元寶），還是始終擁護，人人崇拜，到了這臘尾年頭，年糕做成元寶，橄欖稱做元寶，菜餚中的元寶，更是指不勝屈社會上洋洋乎充滿了一片「　元寶」的聲浪。在廢曆年頭，蘇州各茶寮中的紅淡香茗，壺壺加添橄欖兩枚，喚做「元寶茶」，以討茶客的吉利，這種風俗，相沿已久，到現在仍是奉行不衰。</p>
<p>接路頭</p>
<p>路頭，就是財神，據「封神傳」考證，太公望在封神台上，封神的當兒，共封了五位路頭，專司人間財帛。這一派荒唐神話，却圖之神軸，深深的印在民衆腦筋襄；尤其是一班重利的商人，更希望把財神接到店中，利占大有。所以到了正月初五，家中店舖，都預備大塊的肉，整隻的鷄，全條的鱯魚，鑼鼓喧天的迎接路頭。店家接過路頭，將接路頭的魚肉，製　大嚼，呌做路頭酒，然後開張交易，重幹營生。</p>
<h3 id="c216">上燈與落燈 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>十三日上燈，十八日落燈；蘇州俗例，到了十三那夜，都須在廳堂上供奉的神軸面前，燃點紅燭，呌做「上燈」，從十三起到十八日止，每夜點燃。過十八，然後　起神軸，收拾新年景象。在上燈與落燈兩夜，神軸面前，還須供奉粉製的「元宵」與「圓　」。在這幾天裏蘇州宋仙洲巷猛將堂裏，神面前燃燒着臂膀粗細的蠟燭，紅男綠女，成羣而往，熱鬧異常，呌做看「大蠟燭」；到了夜裏，還有花爆燃放助興。</p>
<p>蘇州年頭的風俗，除了上述幾項，照例奉行外，以前金閭馬路，到了新年，還有兜馬車的風尚。那班挾着花枝的寫意朋友，在馬路上馳騁往來，以示闊氣。年來花事蘭珊，影院勃興，兜馬車已無形淘汰了。</p>

<h3 id="c251">兩個！一顆！一張！ <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>在這外貨領銷，農村衰落之下，國貨事業，大家都當他是黯淡無光，没有什麽希望。辦國貨工廠的，他是愁眉苦臉，認爲没有出路，這雖是實况，但仔細一相，國貨前途，只有光明，没有黑暗，只有發展，没有减退，事在人爲，只要大家有决心，有毅力。</p>
<p>兩個要訣</p>
<p>辦國貨工廠的，只須拿定兩個要訣：一個是澈底合作。從同業合作，以至非同業合作。轉移從前同行嫉妒同業傾軋的眼光，來一致的從事產銷的互助，抵抗外貨的傾銷。一個是减輕成本，用怎様方法，可使物料减省，工人减省，而出品加速與加多。用怎様記載，可以時時考查到什麽地方不合理，什麽地方不經濟，隨時作改進節約的根據。總之一句話，國貨的生命是要大家在改進出品上努力，不是在跌價和粗製濫造上可以生存。</p>
<p>一顆赤心</p>
<p>「買國貨」一名詞，差不多大家都知道，都認爲很有價值的事業。便是一般女太太們奶奶們小姐們，也是認爲很漂亮的事情，你們不信，可以到國貨公司走一趟，便知愛用國貨的，巾幗中人，何讓鬚眉男子。不過大家千萬要有一顆赤心，換句話，便是一種信仰心，有了信仰心，卽使貨品差些，價格貴些，因爲抱了犧牲精神，也要光顧的。</p>
<p>一副面孔</p>
<p>販賣國貨的人，最要緊的，是一副面孔。他天天和愛用國貨的顧客接觸，最大工夫，全在應對招呼聲音笑貌之中。死人面孔，晚爺面孔，都不是國貨公司中應該看見的。你們如果得罪了一個顧客，不但是斷送了一年生意，恐怕以後熱心顧客，都要退避三舍裏足不前了。斷送顧客你們彷彿是做了國貨的仇讎。所以不做國貨公司的店員便罷，要做店員，先要照照你們自已的面孔。</p>
<h3 id="c252">新年快事 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 黄淑英</p>
<p>丨發見了一種新國貨丨</p>
<p>一年四季，使我最感到不快的有兩件事；一件是每當王媽把臉水端上妝台以後，等到我走過去預備洗臉的時候，妝台上的鏡面，總是因了臉水的熱氣的薰蒸而着上一重暈霧，要用乾布三翻四覆地揩擦，然後才能鑑影，一天洗三次臉，就三次這様使人厭煩，不快之至。還有一件是當每喫飯的時候，剛把飯碗一拿近，我所戴的眼鏡上便因了飯的熱氣而生暈霧，逼得你把眼鏡拿下來；然而我的近視程度太深了，一離去眼鏡便没有辦法，這比妝台鏡面生霧的事更感苦痛，一年四季，我被這兩件小小的事糾纒得走投無路！「科學界已經發明到了無綫電，怎麽不見有袪除可厭的暈霧的發明呢？」我不禁常常這様意識到。　　一月十六日那天，我早上起來，被暈霧麻煩了一次以後，照例先翻一翻當天的報紙，然後再去受第二次暈霧的糾纒，忽然瞥見一個觸目的廣告，說是有一個天工實業社發明了一種袪霧妙品，呌做「暈得消」把牠拿來搽擦於任何玻面，則一切暈霧，俱不能犯。「眞有這様的發明嗎？」我不禁熱狂起來，連早飯也不曾好好地喫，立刻跑到唯一的國貨商塲中國國貨公司去。</p>
<p>一走進了中國國貨公司，我的兩隻眼睛貪婪地東張西望，像飢餓的狼似地找尋牠所需要的東西。起初我以爲這「暈得消」應該在五金部發售，走到五金部，一看没有：「也許在化妝品部吧？」這様想時便走到化妝品部，還是没有。這可把我迷糊着了，廣告上不是說中國國貨公司有經售嗎？而且這是國貨，國貨公司應該有售的，怎麽反倒没有呢？後來問該公司的值事人，才知道在「藥品部」發售，於是直奔藥品部。</p>
<p>在藥品部的玻面櫃裏，小小的美麗的扁圓盒子一排一排地耀進我的眼簾，裝璜很是美觀，親和的紫玫瑰色，中間一行秀麗的字，一半是西文「ＷindshieldA」，一半是中文「暈得消」旁邊横着一張價目卡，幾個圓熟的字「每盒五角。」</p>
<p>「這麽小的盒子，要賣五角錢，好貴呀！」這様意識着時，我的往前衝的身子似乎在向後退了。然而似乎聞得一種清醒的聲音：「没有多大實用的胭脂香粉之類還不止賣五角錢哩。」這聲音給了我莫大的勇氣，毫不遲疑地買了一盒回來。</p>
<p>回來以後，不消說得，自然是急於揭開試用，然而我太不小心了，這原來是一種微帶賓石藍色的粉子，我是傾斜着揭開的，所以當揭開的時候，粉子卽紛紛散落，亟亟放平，已經犧牲不少，盒子揭開以後，於是依照了說明書所示的用法，先擦眼鏡，擦過後，呵氣一試，果然不起暈霧，這可把我樂着了。</p>
<p>「王媽！王媽！」我用歡樂的聲音呼喚着。王媽進來見着我像是發了狂的様子，倒把她呆住了。我吩咐王媽怎様用「暈得消」去搽擦鏡面，她如法做了，捧來一盆臉水向妝台一試，於是王媽也樂得幾乎瘋了。</p>
<p>到今天已經半個多月了，我天天生活在愉樂的情緒中，從此不再爲一年四季糾纒不清的暈霧所累，而王媽也似乎清閑多了。</p>
<p>你說這國貨該不該介紹呢？我說不但應該介紹，而且還應該推銷哩，不過有一點要請發明這國貨的天工實業社注意：就是盒子應該改良，否則初次購用的人一定會蒙到損失的，這樣有用的國貨犧牲了很可惜哩！</p>
<h3 id="c253">夫人小姐，你忘記了嗎？ <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 洽成</p>
<p>夫人小姐，你忘記了我們慘痛的一二八紀念嗎？</p>
<p>當那二年之前，大砲，飛機，軍艦以及日本海陸軍大舉進攻上海的時候，砲聲火光籠罩下的上海，是一種什麽現象？如今創痕未復，大仇未報，雖然砲聲似乎遠去了，閘北，吳淞，大塲，眞如的斷壁殘垣所告訴我們的，往事種種，仍舊是歷歷如繪。</p>
<p>這是你一定記得的，國軍抗戰的故事以外，還有許多婦女遭受侮辱的情景，小孩被殘殺的血痕，當時，無論是身受的人，或是遠在千里以外的居民，誰都激起百折不回的民族意識，不獨毁家抒難的應付治標，更有最大的决心去復興中華民族，担起自已所應担的責任，爲個人和羣體犧牲奮鬥！</p>
<p>所以，就是最瞧不起中國人的英國「紳士」，也會在著作和報章上如此說：　　「一二八之役實質上戰勝的是中國」！　　這並不是我們自已掩飾的門面，因爲當時最大的收穫就是我們的决心，那是近百年來歷次創痛所未能獲得的成功。</p>
<p>最明顯的是如火如茶，再接再厲，廣播全國的國貨運動，實在也是一二八的結果，也就是我們這種最大的决心之事實表現。正是爲着要復興中華民族，特殊的要鞏固我們自已民族資本，更從自衛圖保的立塲上，避免資敵以糧的弊病。</p>
<p>然而，一二八已經兩週紀念啦，那最大的决心所表現的，却由熱劇而日趨冷淡，雖然漂亮人都是將重大的過失推在别人身上，怠廢的罪過還不是要我們每個人共同分担。最有力的證明是劣貨入口大增，在人家打過一拳以後，笑面相迎的重來傾銷，還不是我們自已飲酖止渴，資敵以糧！</p>
<p>夫人小姐，你忘記了嗎？在我們慘痛的一二八紀念！</p>
<p>告訴你，你莫要自幸曾安度一二八的大刧，在這人人摩拳擦掌的時候，如果我們自已不早自圖存，比一二八更慘痛的刦運又將重度。這并不是我故意作此危言聳聽，事實擺在面前，祇就人家「一九三六」和「非常時」兩句話來解釋，也足够我們自加猛省！</p>
<p>當我前日訪問潘公展夫人的時候，她說婦女提倡國貨的原因爲要寶貝的子女不作亡國奴，語重心長，實在是我們女界的當頭棒喝。</p>
<p>記者，夫人小姐，天下没有不愛孩子的母親，爲着孩子設想，母親們的努力是應該的。何况，往事足戒，創痕未復，我們怎能放棄自誓的誓言，我們怎能改變我們的最大之决心。</p>
<p>夫人小姐，你忘記了嗎？我們慘痛的一二八紀念！</p>
<p>在婦女國貨年度這不幸的紀念日，我們的太太小姐的感觸必然的格外利害。然而，空言終於無裨於實際，種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆，天助自助者，我們祇有埋下頭去幹，才可以獲得預計的成功。　　我們莫辜負這一二八紀念！</p>
<p>我們莫辜負了婦女國貨年！</p>
<h3 id="c254">輕輕一問 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 李安夫</p>
<p>有許多人這様說：婦婦們的用國貨，正如假吃三觀素的佛婆一様；到了開婦女國貨展覧會國貨遊藝會等的時候，不得不像佛婆碰到了三觀生日似的來應一下時。這自然是過份的說話，不過但願今後的婦女們，不要眞的被他們說着了。</p>
<p>去年是國貨年，但據海關報告，洋货進口的數目，反比前年增高了許多；因此有人提議，明年來一個洋貨年，說不定國貨反可以暢銷了。因爲據說中國人往往是喜歡向反方面走的。</p>
<p>實騐所得；當你到布店裏去買衣料而辨不出國貨或洋貨時，你只要輕輕的問一聲夥計，這様夥計總以爲你是喜歡用洋貨的，於是他就會告訴你是什麽貨色。這就是最正確的指導。</p>
<h3 id="c255">國產甘油 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 新生</p>
<p>甘油俗稱洋蜜，用處很大。無論製造醫藥品，化裝品，烟捲，罐頭食物，印刷油墨，和其他若干工業，都很需要。並且它是製造炸藥的重要材料，因爲關係國防，所以凡是獨立國家，没有不設廠自製的；但是我國却一向無人製造。</p>
<p>最近五洲大藥房，設立第二廠，購辦新式機械，聘請專門人材，創製國貨甘油，這實在是國貨年中一件差强人意的事！但創業是很不容易的，要努力現在，還要顧及將來，五洲現任總經理項繩武君發表的談話說：「製造甘油本來是利用製皂的廢料，但是我們現在要另設新廠的原因，就是鑒於一二八的無情炸彈，燬我閘北精華，所以現在製造甘油，工塲不敢設立在一處，倘燬一廠，尚有存留，基礎不至於完全燬滅。」這是多麽沈痛的話喲！</p>
<p>關於五洲製造甘油的情形，滬上記者團已經親往參觀，並且在各報上有滿意詳細的報告；這裏不再多談，聽說這最初出世的國產甘油，已經决定用星球牌的商標，並且卽日正式發行，必然能够得到全國工商業的樂用。現在調查它的種類如下：</p>
<p>一號（雙蒸）ＣＰ醫藥用　比重一·二六</p>
<p>二號（雙蒸脫色）Ｔehc工業用　比重一·二六</p>
<p>三號（單蒸未脫色）Ｔech工業用　比重一·二六</p>

<h3 id="c256">古怪 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 了然</p>
<p>科學旣經昌明之後，使人類的精神少年了許多，在科學裏舊的大槪是要不得，新的才是好的。比方燒火酒鉗頭　使之蓬蓬鬆鬆。已不甚時新了，遠不及電氣燙髮那蓬鬆之充更永久。這當然是新的好。</p>
<p>然而「後之視今，亦猶今之視昔」，要使許多老頑固飄然。現今的青年鼻子這麽高麽？不忙，過二十年也和咱們差不離，咱們二十年前也是新黨。要等他們也受受打擊，看看氣燄全没有了，等到那時再較量誰是頑固！</p>
<p>那糾紛，就在以爲新的皆是好的或壞的，以爲舊的皆是壞的或好的。這麽標凖一定，便要生出許多毛病來，無以名之，名之曰古怪病。</p>
<p>青年穿西裝而　烟斗，要使長袍大褂而捧水烟筒的老輩歎氣，以爲古怪得可以了。及至青年們也弄古董，看線裝書，使渠們更當詫異，也走上咱們這道兒了嗎？原來外國人也讀論語。而咱們新的東西，便也涵蓋一切。新的總是好的了</p>
<p>然而新與舊，好與壞皆是相對之詞。那麽新的標凖又在那裏呢？巴黎女人的帽子，便未曾有過兩頂相同，每人都别扭成一個様兒，多少總比旁人的要新一點。而中國文學，則據說盧那卡茨理的文藝理論之類還不算新，要高爾基才行；然高爾基也已成爲舊作家了，不會更新到那裏去的，也還是不行。那麽也還是要視新作家頭髮之長短或黑領結之大小爲轉移的。</p>
<p>于是乎便很艱難，使時下的人們覺得那様好。國粹國學之流弄的人少了，因爲漸漸覺到太極拳雖是好，也抵擋不過洋鬼子之皮鞭或手槍，這很使人喪氣，没有法子。弼卡德新到想上天，而上海有人則要侳在一根柱上六十日，這也要算新的世界紀錄的。然則到底怎様才是好的呢？</p>
<p>曰：是亦不難見。總之來一個古怪而已。比方寫文章吧，引一大通古史，作成一種新文；繪畫則用西洋的和中國的技藝混在一塊。西洋人看了是東方畫，東方人看了是西洋畫。講話最好夾雜中文和英文；穿衣掌呢，内穿襯衫，加以套褲，再穿皮鞋和套鞋，再加長袍，再加大衣，合成一種不中不西的様兒，則也非新非舊，到處通行的。</p>
<p>更有一點應該注意的，則是古怪之外，再加上一點不可了解的質素，使人永遠感覺糢糊，便可算更新更時髦了。</p>

<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>有一個朋友剛從日本回國，說起留日學生的近况，眞是呌人又氣又好笑的。　　有一次，有一位同學因某種嫌疑被便衣偵探挾入警視廳後，問他那里人？他說：『中華民國人』。給他兩記耳光。再問，他說：『遼寗省人』。又是兩記耳光。又問，他說：『奉天人』。還是給他兩記耳光。他想不願再吃這種眼前虧了，當他再被審問的時候，只好答道：『滿洲國人。不料又是兩記耳光打來。他眞不知如何答覆纔好。最後問他，他說：『亡國奴』。日警不覺獰笑，他却悲從中來，慘然流涙了。</p>
<p>去年秋季開學，工業大學招考，中國學生應考的十六人，筆試全然取錄。不料口試的時候，只取十五人。這位落第的學生去質問學校當局，當局問他那里人？他說：『中華民國人』。又問他是那一省？他說：『遼寗省』。又問他遼寗還屬中國麽』？他惶急，不知如何答覆，但爲了入學校，只好違心答道：『滿洲國』。學校當局點頭微笑，把他取錄了。</p>
<p>九一八事變以後，中國留日學生回國的不少，剩下來不過七八百人，目下又增加到兩千人，東北學生約占六分之一，其餘就算廣東江浙川湘幾省的學生爲多了。</p>
<p>原來在東京有中華民國留學生會的，最近這種組織無形消滅了。東北幾省留學生還是稱中華民國留學生好？稱所謂『滿洲國』留學生好？這當然是同學會組織不成的重要原因之一了，何况還有思想派别之不同呢！</p>
<p>自命爲所謂『滿洲國』的留學生，官費領得較多，至少在一百元以上，日人待遇他們也似乎有意籠絡，比較還好。他們裏面有些人也就自視好像比中華民國留學生要高一等，這眞是不知所云了。　　以上記一留學日本的朋友的話。</p>
<h3 id="c258">晚上 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 草明女士</p>
<p>那年的冬天，我們鄉裏的絲廠，接連倒閉了十一家。當我底工作驟然被停止了的時候，我便頭也不回地跑到城裏找活做，寄住在一個靠父親遺產過活的年青的堂叔父家裏。他好並不很大的房屋丨丨一個客廳，三間房子，還有廚房和寛敞的院子丨丨除了他那衰老的母親之外，還有一個媽子：不過那兒常常聚集着一班跟他很投機的朋友，徹夜吵鬧不休。</p>
<p>我爲子想從城市的人們底眼睛裏逃避我那鄉姑娘的習氣，常常寗願跑到廚房裏帮媽子燒飯。</p>
<p>晚飯吃過了，客廳照例坐着八叔，他底朋友們，和整天捧着水烟袋不願放手的叔祖母：我在廚房洗過了脚，倚住門框，愀秋地望着那穿了灰暗的衣裳，全身嵌着疎疎的星點的天空。南面角落那帶淺藍色的寒雲，抑鬱地蓋着我那衰落的故鄉，順德。客廳裏明亮的燈光伴着男人們底狼呌様的談話，穿過走廊透出來。街外，胡琴和琵琶單調而脆裂地顫鳴着，繞着我們屋後走過，漸漸被寒冷的風捲去了。</p>
<p>叔祖母做出年青人們底瘋狂態度，幾乎喘不過來地揮着手對我說：「靈女，趕快去把盲妹呌進來……」</p>
<p>我預先把　子裏在圍巾裏，雙肩一縮，像火船破浪般衝着寒氣跑出巷口。我那被黑暗阻塞的不連續的呼喊，消失在凄清的，驕傲的琴聲裏。一個形容枯槁的老媽子，拖着兩個瞎眼的姑娘，一個瘦長的，一個胖胖的，幾匹羊似地跟在我後面走。剛好探出愁苦的臉來的月亮平靜面幽暗地照着她們底仔細的，鞋底不離地的脚步。</p>
<p>老媽子給她們除下了半新的斗篷，她們底被風吹得要破了的紫紅的肌肉，敏捷地一抖，預備吸收室内底暖氣。她們喝過了我給她們倒的熱茶之後，跟着機械地用俚俗的語調和男人們雜亂地調笑起來。等到姑娘們急速地運用指頭開始歌唱的時候，男人們才豎着耳朶，瞪着眼？像要搜索什麽似地釘着她們。</p>
<p>「那兒是解手的？」歌聲停了，老媽子悄悄地走到我身邊扯扯我底袖子低聲問，跟着向那瘦長的指指。我把那盲妹帶到我住的小房間裏，便坐在床邊，由暗黄的燈光之下望着她底陰鬱而矛盾地掛住水没有停目過笑容的臉孔。</p>
<p>「你從小就看不見東西了麽？」我問她。</p>
<p>「晤，是呀。」她冷淡地說。</p>
<p>「我聽見人家說，對於你們唱歌的，笑，是很需要的哩。」我像不滿意她底笑貎似地說了，她即毫不留心地只用鼻音應着。我更加不快活了，這様對她加上一句：</p>
<p>「你從没有哭過吧，我想？」</p>
<p>「在我，不是一様麽！」她粗魯地說了，却又笑着像向自已解嘲似地說，「當眞，哭和笑有什麽分别呢，我看不見呀。」</p>
<p>「我在鄉下的時候，常常聽見講到你們底生活和你們底乾娘的故事哩……」客廳裏混亂的笑聲不時地閃進房裏來，我望住她那給胭脂染紅了的臉蛋繼續說：「你心裏會常常感着不好過的麽？你討厭你底乾娘麽？」她皺了皺眉，没回答。「其實，像我們一輩子求人的人，簡直像放在熱水鍋裏的螃蟹一様。」我說了，你下頭，沉思起來。</p>
<p>「人，是吃自已的同伴的傢伙，我這様覺得。」她那突然聲響，使我受了驚，頭迅速抬起來。「只要他抓住了那種東西。是呀，無論誰，只要抓住了那些汚穢的東西，就可以跳起來吃人了……」最後，她用笑聲完結了她底話，「而且，我是什麽都看不見的哩。」</p>
<p>她底臉是那様嚴肅而陰沉，我站在她身旁，直像跟一束野薔薇的有剌的枝幹縛在一起似地。</p>
<p>「當眞，我常常在害怕呢，丨丨我不曉得我身邊有些什麽……」走過走廊的時候，她用怯弱的聲音說了。</p>
<p>十點鐘過後，老媽子把討來的六毛錢仔細地察看了，三個人方輪船拖貨艇似地走出了大門，一串蠕動的影子，慢慢地溶化在黑底海裏面去了。</p>
<h3 id="c259">趣喻 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>（十）（四）</p>
<p>何喬遠與莊應曙書云：「君爲詩，將生而對人讀之乎？抑死後任人讀之也？生有莊應曙在旁曰：吾詩如此如此。若死而任人讀之，則必使吾之意通於千百世之後，俾觀者自得之。尚可從旁曰，吾詩如此耶？」很多的作家，作詩文往往喜求怪趣，有意的寫得怪誕，令人不懂，反自譽爲一種獨創，甚至不憚繁以千萬語自解。若此信，用生前死後的趣喻，說要使人懂得的至理，可謂對證發藥，使彼等無言。此李寗所以拒絶未來派彫塑家爲卡爾塑像也。</p>
<p>（十）（五）</p>
<p>論「傀儡」的文字很有不少，最近看到周圻「百安」與何省齋書，又復談到。其言曰：「弟幼時見傀儡戲，二尺許長，線索纍纍，任人提弄，近則變爲數寸許，以木板推之，全似自用聰明者。嗟夫丨傀儡亦且漸小，何况於人。傀儡亦不由人綫索，而欲自運聰明，可畏亦可悲夫丨」二百年後的現在，其可悲也，是更甚了。因爲傀儡，在當時，你是一看便知：現在却不然，做得巧妙的，不但使你不知，甚且傀儡自已亦像煞有介事的向人自解，此帮閒文學，西崽文學之所以產生也。中國歷史，有人說，是一部奴隸史，事實上，也同様的是一部傀儡史，不知亦有以鄙意爲然者否？</p>
<p>（十）（六）</p>
<p>「久雨不晴，個個拖泥帶水；直待雲開日現，正眼豁開，方好向虚空裏打筋斗也。别峯相見，自有作家，請足下圓前話。」此黄端伯與黄子安書也，文章寫得飄逸有致，且「拖泥，」，「觔斗」，兩趣喻，用得亦生動異常。</p>
<p>（十）（七）</p>
<p>劉達生與余集生論做官曰：「世間極認眞事曰做官，極虚幻事曰做戲，而弟竊愚甚，每於塲中見歌哭笑駡，打諢揷科，便確認爲眞。眞不在所扮古人，而在此扮古人之戲子，一一俱有父母妻兒，一一俱要養空活口，一一俱以哭笑打諢，養父母，活妻兒，此戲子乃眞古人也。又每自於頂冠束帶，妝模做様之際，確然自道一眞官，天下亦無一人疑我爲戲子者，正不知打恭看坐，懽容笑口，與夫作色正容，凛莫敢犯之官人，實卽此養家活口，做哭做笑之古人耳。乃拿定一戲塲。戲具，戲本，戲腔，至五臟六腑，全爲戲用，而自亦不覺爲眞戲子，悲夫！」此公所見，眞是超人一等，不但扯破了許多「官人」的假面，使我們也能以看到明代末季的「官人」的形形色色，也使數百年後滿口爲國爲民的「官人」哭笑不得，喻得澈底而有趣。</p>

<p>— 吳巖</p>
<p>這位歐洲紳士便將又尖又長的鼻子，伸了下去，但在朦朧的醉眼中，也漸漸地鑑别出來這是不够美的。鼻子裏哼出一聲Ｎo，就失望地抬起頭來。隨卽憂鬱地低聲唱着：</p>
<p>“ＷhereissnerＭysweetgirl……”</p>
<p>照見包着黑布帕子的男子的頭，電光便在那粗燥的腀部上面，遊戲三四分鐘，讓這位心急的紳士飽飽地看個够。同時利用他那醉了的胡塗心情，便略帶打趣的調子問：</p>
<p>“Ｉsshebeautiful?”</p>
<p>Ｎo,Ｎo,Ｎo,Ｎo,Ｎo,Ｎo,</p>
<p>鼻子裏發出一串獸了似地呌聲。隨卽抓著我的肩頭亂摇，粗暴地笑著，强烈的酒氣，直衝我的鼻子。</p>
<p>“ＨaＨaＨaＣhinamanlＨaＨaＨa”</p>
<p>我想他一定還没有認出這是男子吧，原因是，一則想不到世界上竟有這麽様的旅館，不相熟的男女會睡在一張大床上的。他的嘩笑大槪是奇怪我怎麽會發出那様的愚問吧了。</p>
<p>這様遊戲了好一陣，每個房間都去玩過了，終於没有找着一個好看的姑娘。當然的，這位歐洲紳士是非常的頽喪，嘴裏就仍舊憂鬱地哼着他那老是哼不完的調子。</p>
<p>“Ｗhereisshc?Ｍysweetgirl”</p>
<p>我却高興極了，愉快極了，簡直想跑上山峯去，大呌幾聲，讓山澤林莽都知道我的快樂呵。</p>
<p>但他的貪慾的火燄，尚未熄去，無論如何，還要到别家去遊獵，我也趁一時的歡喜，便率性去玩個痛快，就帶他到老劉那家店子走去。</p>
<p>屋外的馬塲，浸在清清冷冷的月光裏面。地上散亂地點綴着淡墨色的馬的陰影，到處都響着牙齒磨着稻草的聲音。不時，在稍遠的地方，間或有馬在作聲地噴着鼻子。稻草的乾香和着馬尿的濃味，隨着微微吹指的夜風，一陣陣地飄來。</p>
<p>露天下燃着的火堆，已没有熊熊的光輝了，但那紅紅的餘燄，却還留着；馬哥頭捲屈地睡在側邊，簑衣和月光温柔地蓋在身上。犬兒聽着我們的足聲，狂噪地吠了起來；睡在地上的主人，翻起身，粗暴地叱責着。我向他作了一個有禮貌的問訊，便輕輕地走開了，犬兒依舊轉去，平平靜靜地伏着。</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈初穩繼疲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小三四角不　　坎拿大小三角左右、當初開　、以北　　　仍有去胃、近期標凖、屢有收進、不過廠家籌碼、步有出檔、市塲投機、亦順勢反出、故二盤以後、形勢卽漸漸軟弱、至洋麥情形、聞政府麥又成交一船、價低至四元一角、由阜豐定成、因此該廠套頭、亦步接續、照洋麥之陸被成交、供求之不能兩敵、後步局面、恐仍不佳矣、結果本月份較前日小二厘半、三四月份小五厘、五月份小七厘半、六月份五厘、七月份小一分、</p>

<p>桐油銷塲、本賴對外貿易、近年來因洋銷不振、以致市面終年長疲短俏、本埠號家素來以内銷爲主體、但因農村經濟破產、百業凋敝、桐油又非日用貨品、所受影響、似較他業爲甚、惟各號均有悠久之歷史、且以穩健爲主、故縱有盈虧、亦屬有限、卽二三千元出入、盤查時以存貨價格而計高下、固不爲奇也、而各號以上年份營業、獲利不易、故報平者、十居八九、雖間有一二獲　　之家、或　　　八積而來、實例外耳　本年份各家均照常營業、蓋斯業範圍不大、營業穩固、雖不能特呈異彩、然亦不致有大損失也、各號照例於前日一槪上市、而開始營業矣、</p>

<h3 id="c310">賢妻良母 <a href="#c310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— 炯女士</p>
<p>因爲數千年來的封建，宗法思想的傳統，一直到現在，所謂一般自命爲二十世紀的無論老年或青年男人的腦海中，却仍舊免不了希望一般女子復辟舊有的賢妻良母的職責爲已任，而不許其在社會上有大的發展和努力！希望朝夕隷属在男人的控制與宰割下。根據人類自私自利的天性，我們旣不能絶對的否認他們的原因，而更願詳細的，冷靜的觀察，承認客觀條件鑄成過去女子被壓迫和只能被做賢妻良母的唯一責任的事實！</p>
<p>賢妻良母，是一句壓迫我們的口號，同時也是男人們站在他們在身的利益上而思獲得最後的目的唯一的步伐！所以我們着先就要知道在目前這様一個狂風暴雨的歷史的嚴重時期中，我們不希望作一個純良的賢妻，也並不絶對的作一個良母，而消滅我們整個人類的幸福和人生的意義；我們也要負着重大的使命，而推動社會的進化，向前！</p>
<p>翻開社會進化史一看，人類的初先發展的各個歷程，各有其自已生產條件，那時人類没有男女和階級們區别，更没有什麽壓迫者與被壓迫者的不同。</p>
<p>由於母系制度的廢滅和父系制度的勃興，原姓共產制度的破裂，而知有制度的生長的結果，乃是生產方法進化所携來的一大社會革命，並且是人類歷史上的第一次大革命。這個革命的結果，把從前婦女在民族社會的重要地位完全推翻，從此以後，婦女完全隷屬於男子而處於奴隷的地位。丨丨這在婦女的歷史上，要算首先罹受奴隷地位的人類。但在經濟權操縱於男子手中，不是原有的事實，由於居諾甫的證明說「最初人類經濟權，在母系制度時，完全操縱在婦女手中，女子不僅是原始時代家庭工業的創造者，並且是原始時代的農夫，家庭工業在原始物物交換時代，佔有重要位置。最初的分工，是女子種植園蔬，而男子飼養牲畜；在這分工基礎之上，一切社會秩序隨着排列。婦女因爲在生產地位上之重要，所以在民族社會上，也居重要地位。這種重要地位，非生產上起有根本的變化，是推不翻的」……我們便知婦女在過去的歷史上，並没有專備作賢妻良母的資格，而也有偉大的本領！母權的推翻，是女性在歷史上一個大的失敗，自從化族制度破滅的開始，生產方法漸漸進步，一人的勞働，可以供給一人以上的需要時，這就陷婦女於隷屬地位丨丨卽是所謂賢妻良母，爲婦女唯一責任的口號，便從此產生了。男子旣在民衆庭取得統治權，婦女卽成爲單純的生育機械與供男子使用之奴隷。卽是造成生產方法改變和進化的結果，主要的產業和生產物，都被男子所占有的時候，婦女便失掉了經濟獨立的機會，當然由於這様生活的需要，在無可奈何的過程中，而一般婦女也只有可憐的屈服於男子的桎梏之下！於是婦女漸漸的在經濟方面和社會方面，處處隸屬於男子，完全成了男子的附屬品物私玩弄品了。在這時候，賢妻良母的口號，便高唱入雲霄，婦女們本身的一切自由，都犧牲在男人們的控制與摧殘底下，而不敢稍有所呻吟吐洩！這是一件如何痛心的事啊！</p>
<p>本來男女兩性的區别，只有生理上的差異，决没有多大的不同！因此，男女兩性的勞動，也只有接着男女的生理而與以適當的勞工，决没有天淵的輕重！所以從此我們當知道婦女除了上述的所謂賢妻良母的責任之外，更應知道社會上還等着我們婦女的力量去發展和開拓的事業尚多呢！</p>
<h3 id="c311">捧 <a href="#c311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— 寗一</p>
<p>「奉」字之旁加上一手或一木，其字義卽各不同，加手變「捧」加木變「棒」「捧」者動字，「捧」者名詞，一動一不動其别已顯然！</p>
<p>「棒」木頭之謂也，經過外力的加上和使用，倒也會動動，三家村裏的　猻王·使用着它纔會使他高徒安靜地念着「趙錢孫李？」至於半夜捉賊·手拖着棒，也足使賊寒膽，這様顯然這「棒」與人無緣，吃棒頭聽了誰都會摇頭！</p>
<p>至於「捧」字，出於自動，見人捧捧他也許得益匪淺，不像「棒」字受人使用，祇知侵害他人？於是捧字格外地受人歡迎，這頭年頭兒做人最要乖？旣不國事高談，自然來瞎談，棒旣不受人歡，做人只得隨和些而來談衆所共欽的「捧」字？</p>
<p>在前已說過，捧是出於自動，但這不能一槪而論，事實時常會有相反者，璧如說伶人在未登臺前常有宴請有說好說壞他們魔力的人們之舉？至於被請人們，因着嘴裏已被塞了東西！於是根據「得人錢財與人消災」的定理，在報上極力喻揚，假使藝術眞蹩脚的話也所不管，上面屬於被動之流。</p>
<p>出於自動者，其實也是自私？其原動力無非是在益於已，或有損於人者！見着要人闊老不妨當面巴結，在報上做篇文章恭維一下；或是歌功頌德，至於惡意者，例如美貎坤伶登臺，時有人們狂喝彩，拍手，其實那裏是讚賞藝術的美妙，不過想藉此進身，得彼青徠，而墮其壞念？這一切屬於自動者流。</p>
<p>更有不欲捧人而須人捧者，做官須有人打邊鼓？然後纔能福至官來，更須在任上，時有人在報上歌其德政，那就利益非淺？至於某種名義已定，而在物色人選時，那正是暗示捧×者多那就由×去幹，所以不欲幹則已，欲幹就得需要捧者。以前袁×做皇帝夢，什麽登極，定年號，要不是有人捧，眞老不起面皮來幹，至於現在的東北那個我們旣不承認；又未撲滅的僞國，那個傀儡，自然也是捧的作怪，有着鄭逆的進勸，更有不轉好念的矮冤家讚成，自然皮老起來了！總之有着「捧」，自然會弄得烏烟瘴氣起來。</p>
<h3 id="c312">我，你，他 <a href="#c312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— 襲人</p>
<p>當我從樓上下來聽電話的時候，我的朋友笑着把耳機授給我，這本來是平淡無奇的事，每天打給我的電話不知有多少，從不見他那般滑稽的面孔，所以我不由地問了：「誰」我的朋友没有回答，他再扮了個鬼臉跑開去了。小姐，這就是使我驚奇的事了，耳機的那邊是一個女人的聲音，何怪我的朋友有那般的態度了。我是被人說過太不知道女人的男子，而且我也太不能接近女人。我對女人不知道態度要卑恭，我對女人不知這談吐要温雅……一切的一切，我對於女人太不知道了。然而我接到一個女人來的電話，小姐，要是在半年以前，我聽見了聲音之後，可以毫不遲疑地問：「你是××嗎？」現在不能，我費功地問了半天，原來還是你丨小姐。</p>
<p>光陰過得眞快，又是另一個新年了，我們都是又長大一歲了。新年裏你問我做些什麽事，小姐，我告訴你些什麽呢？如其不是一張張催討賬欵的紙條飛來，我眞不知道又是一年的開始了，所以我僅僅回答了「没有什麽！」而這時候耳機内變了個男子的聲音，他的談吐確是那様温雅，尊稱了×先生之後，就向我恭賀新禧，恕我當時失禮，没有說一句客套的話。說起來，小姐，你們結婚的時候我没有前來道賀，討一杯喜酒，對於一個不認識的男子我還是不知道對付的，說我太不知道女人祇道着了一半，我是太不知道人和人之間交際丨或者是和欺騙差不多丨手段。</p>
<p>小姐，承蒙你們兩位從南國週遊歸來之後，想到從前的故人，特在一年開始的新年裏請我吃飯，在理是我無論如何不便回絶的；但是半年來，我太不長進了，依是那様一個一切都不知道的男子，我愧對故人，愧對故人的未見面的伴侣！我欺騙了你，說我工作塲所有宴會，自然，故人是知道我的，我聽清楚你說着「他撒謊啊」。同時兩個笑聲傳來，大槪是你依偎在他的肩頭上，而你的他還說了多少類於客套的話，啊！我太不知道應用欺騙，第一砲就被你識破我是撒謊，所以我對他竟至没有說一句「謝謝」或「再會」。因爲始終是個太不知道人和人之間的交際手段。再會罷，恭賀新禧！</p>
<h3 id="c313">誰替海派辯護 <a href="#c313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— 阿曇</p>
<p>在申報本埠增刊寫了一篇，「論賣文爲活」，引出了青農先生的文章，他說：阿曇誤會了沈從文先生的原意，而替「海派辯護」，爲「助紂爲虐」，其實，並不是阿曇誤會了沈從文先生的文章，到是青農先生，誤會了阿曇的文章。　　首先，阿曇並不是看得起海派的人。所以，看到曹聚仁先生的「海派京派都應該盪掃」的話，覺得極對。並且同意他的「兩者比較之間，則與其京焉寗海」。因爲海派多少和社會有些關係，而京派是想脫離社會，（請參看曹先生的原文）那末，可見阿曇並不把「賣錢」認做海派的特徵（所以說「所謂商業競爭是包刮很多的）阿曇所以寫那篇「論賣文爲活」，只是從「商業競賣」四字聯想而來。（記得在原文中是聲明了的）阿曇這一篇文章，旣不是答復沈從文先生，也不是替海派辯護，所以就是「刻薄一點」所說到的「他」也不是指沈從文先生，而是指無原則的拿文字賣錢攻擊人的人。我不懂青農先生，到底從何誤會起的？</p>
<p>青農先生，一再的告訴我們，誰是　　海派，海派的種類，是可以感謝的。因爲我們可以「認清漢奸而加以攻擊」。就是阿曇，也認爲「商人與賊」的人是，應該攻擊。他們是連人格也出賣。阿曇的原文中，一再的提到賣的是不是毒和春藥，是極明顯的。</p>
<p>說得明白一點，阿曇那篇文章的主意，不過要說明賣文，並不是可恥的，「京派」嘲笑海派是有「商業競賣一條」，而賣文的並不是完全「海派」，只是賣文也不能搆成「海派」，阿曇是杜斯退益夫斯基爲例子，但杜氏是不是海派呢？</p>
<p>沈從文先生所說的「商業競賣」，好像說賊是吃飯的，阿曇的文章，不過說明吃飯的不完全是，賊，問題是在「偷不偷東西」。如此而已。</p>
<p>對於「商人與賊」之流，青農先生說：我們「賣文爲活」的人「只能認之爲「漢奸」，而加以攻擊」，假使阿曇狂妄一點，就要說：他和阿曇原文的特别提出的「賣春藥砒毒」之流，以有别於賣魚肝油者，没有十二分不同。至於青農先生，希望「海派文人」創作出文壇燦爛光彩，恕我再狂妄一點：「青農先生的對於「海派」，是較之阿曇寛恕得多了」</p>
<p>海派文人的值得攻擊，是没有問題的。就是阿曇也主張掃盪，不過假使只以賣錢（自然不賣人格）爲海派文人罪，是不是以伏阿曇的心的。自然沈從文先生乃至青農先生，都没有單獨拿賣錢爲海派文人罪，那末，阿曇的文章，不是替海派辯護，是當然的了。</p>
<h3 id="c314">漂亮的娘姨 <a href="#c314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— 愛溪</p>
<p>當娘姨的必要條件，照理是祇要她會做事，能乾凈；面孔的好看與否？似乎都不成問題。但是話雖這様說，事實確偏不這様的表演着！</p>
<p>尤其像這繁華炫耀的上海，更加是這様！</p>
<p>數月之前的一天，後樓搬進一家新鄰居：一個老頭，一個少婦。幾天以後，我才知道他們是公公和媳婦，兩人相處，頗稱自得；她的婆婆乃是留洋「阿媽」，兒子的貴幹，則不得而知。</p>
<p>近幾天來，他們翁媳兩個，感情似乎日漸發現裂痕，時常聽見他們在高聲底聲的謾駡；並且各人燒飯各人吃，很有「同屋而居，異炊而食」之槪。媳婦忽於每天清晨，擦脂抹粉，用盡人工之修飾；而且這様一來，房中坐不住了，便天天朝出夕歸丨丨但不知她是做什麽事？</p>
<p>「後樓嫂嫂，那裏去」？一天她已裝飾好，而預備出門的時候，我笑着問。　　「找生意去，帮人去」。</p>
<p>「怪不得這幾天，又見你在家，是找生意啊」！</p>
<p>「是啊！年輕輕的在家閒着，做什麽」！</p>
<p>「找到没有」？</p>
<p>「前天有一家生意，因主人要出門，想把我帶着同去，我不高興」。</p>
<p>「不是又得另找了嗎」？</p>
<p>「不，昨天有人介紹到××坊××號，一家公館去：這家新死了太太，要找人照指小孩；每天還有外水呢」！她很得意似的說。</p>
<p>「睡覺回來吧」？</p>
<p>「不回來，同少爺一房睏；但是兩只床，我同小孩睏一起。少爺說：娘姨要漂亮的，乾凈的，我今天去他家看看丨丨大槪是可以合式的吧」！</p>
<p>她便滿面春風似的，邊講邊笑的走了。</p>
<p>還示隔了兩個鐘頭。她復踅回來搬被頭，外面復立着一個抱小孩的男人，自然是生意成功了。不過她剛把被頭拿出門的時候，復又掉頭望着後樓，惡狠狠的駡了一句：「讓你這倒頭的老頭………」。</p>
<p>「走吧！阿媽！」她忽然聽見外面抱着小孩的那個男子的呼聲，她便立刻在『來哉！來哉！少爺！』的笑聲裏，把身子一扭，做出那「一笑百媚生」的様子來！</p>
<p>「當娘姨也要漂亮，原來如此」！我腦筋裏深深地印着這様的一個念頭。</p>

<h3 id="c315">阿毛的新衣 <a href="#c315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— 已而</p>
<p>那眞是邀天之大福，經常穿着百結破舊的衫褲的阿毛，年末居然也做起了一件新衣，預備在新正裏和人家爭些體面。</p>
<p>她已經有好幾次過年没有衣穿了。像前歲，母親雖也曾堅决地答應要給她添製一套；可是終因爲父親有天在馬路上推獨輪車給一輛摩托卡撞翻，被巡捕抓去罰了一塊錢，致影響到那件預定新衣，也就没有如願以償。</p>
<p>過了這個新年，她剛滿九歲，小孩子也並不大懂得怎様呌時髦，但她總覺得新年没得新衣穿，確是件很可羞的事實。</p>
<p>記得是前年，因地在元旦日依舊穿着那套檻　不堪的破衣，便給許多同玩的女孩子們取笑了一番，使她很懊喪。所以她從那時起卽立下個宏願，此後無論如何，總要極力和爺娘交涉製給她一件新衣，以雪宿恨。</p>
<p>果然，這回目的算達到了。以九角二分大洋買來的一件綠條子洋布新衣，終於由媽媽偷了四天夜工在燈下製就了。媽媽的針繳雖不見得怎様好，做成了却也頗合裁。當時呌阿毛試穿着，爸爸在旁贊道很稱身，她也直跳躍起來，喜歡得什麽似的。</p>
<p>她於是對爸爸和媽媽說：</p>
<p>「我開心極了，新年我有新衣穿了」！</p>
<p>爸爸笑着；媽答道：</p>
<p>「阿毛！好了，不必年初一再哭喪着臉了！不過總得珍惜點，不要弄骯　！一過正月半就須換下來，後日逢過節或看熟鬧時再穿」！</p>
<p>爲着有這一件新衣，使阿毛日日盼望新年早些到臨。好容易大除夕才挨到。常晚她和爺娘吃過了年夜飯。爸爸給她十二個銅板作壓歲錢，吩咐說！</p>
<p>「阿毛，夜裏快些去睡覺，明天好早點起來出去玩。」</p>
<p>「爸，好，明天早點起來出去玩！」她學着爸爸的說話，忽而轉過頭來：　　「媽，明早五點鐘喚我醒，我要起來穿新衣給爸爸媽媽拜年。」</p>
<p>大年初一清晨，一陣爆竹聲響，阿毛不得媽唤，早就自已醒來了。在剛睜開了眼的刹那間，她獨自躺在被窩裏回味着夜裏的夢境。</p>
<p>她夢見穿着那套新做的綠條子洋布短衫褲，和許多熟識的小朋友到一片空地去玩要。她還帶了幾種零食，吃得很喜樂。而且那些遊伴們個個都稱羨她新衣，說是十分漂亮；她覺得這是有生以來最榮幸的一天，因而也驕傲起來。</p>
<p>想到這裏，她不由自地笑了一笑，便摇醒睡在身旁的媽，喊着要取新衣穿。這時媽給她驚覺了，「咳」的一聲，接着側轉身來用手撫摸着女兒的細髮，慈愛地哄道：</p>
<p>「阿毛，你醒了嗎？時候還早呀。我告訴你，昨晚爸爸臨睡時叮嚀我說，明早阿毛醒來，呌她新衣不必穿，新年初穿新衣没有什麽大意思。元宵節打算大家到舅舅家裏去玩一趟，到　時再穿好，　　以　點新鮮，教舅舅看了，就會更歡喜你呢！」</p>
<p>「不，不！我今天就要穿！」張大眼睛，着急喊起來。</p>
<p>「好阿毛，乖乖聽媽的話！中秋穿的那件黑布衫也備好，我前天給你洗乾凈了。」</p>
<p>「誰高興穿那件，那件前襟和袖子都補過了的？我不要，我一定要穿新衣！新年没有新衣穿，人家要欺侮我！」阿毛幾乎要哭出來了，說着上下唇急閉着。</p>
<p>父親也醒了，便也温柔地安慰道：　　「好孩子，聽媽的話，或者初九穿好了，初九是玉皇帝生日。」</p>
<p>「不，今天穿，初九也要穿，到舅舅家去也要穿！」阿毛頑强地說。</p>
<p>經過了幾番哄騙，她總是不就範。在萬分痛心之下，父親終於動怒了，狠狠地打了她兩下耳光。反應當然是阿毛的哭聲。結果還虧媽媽費了許多好話，去說服她，又給她幾個零錢，才把她騙住了。</p>
<p>用過早餐阿毛也無可奈何地穿上那件半舊的黑布衫，溜到外面去玩了。家裏留着他們夫妻倆間坐着。母親忽然嘆了一聲說：</p>
<p>「窮人偏生就這様註定没福，連一件製造了的新衣也不能好好地教她穿出去見見人。哄一哄便得了，孩子曉得什麽，何必就動手！」</p>
<p>「我那裏眞要打她？不過覺得太悲痛了，就禁不住發怒起來；唉！」</p>
<p>「米店老闆不肯通融，我呌你就拿這條棉被去好了，你又定要那新衣。」母親紅着眼眶說。</p>
<p>「棉被！天這様冷，没有這條棉被，怕就要凍死了呢……還有隔壁陳家嫂嫂兩隻洋，我苦苦哀求了，才答應延至月半。」父親無限傷感地。</p>
<p>夫妻正在咳聲歎氣的當兒，阿毛突然從門外哭着進來，斷續地抽着氣說：　　「媽！給我新衣穿呀！人家又來欺侮我了。他們說，我像呌化子。那件新衣也不是爸爸的錢買來做的，是前天媽在一個弄堂垃圾堆裏檢零物時拾到了四張兩角紙票子買的，你爲什麽不讓我穿！</p>
<p>他倆的心像針剌一股。竟找不出一句話好勸慰她。只見兩人的眼涙泉水似地由眼角直淌流了下來！</p>

<p>「周五爺不要給錢了，拿來就是。」徐三從地單上站了起來。</p>
<p>「拿去。好漿子的。」周春榮把錢給了他，便躺到床上，接了曹先生的香烟。</p>
<p>接了錢，到屋角裏没有找着所要的燈籠，徐三便縮着頭出了門。一股冷氣又撲上了他的臉。漆黑的天上嚮着微弱的風，一流熱氣在他心裏動。一批貨販子挑着擔子從他身邊經過，穿草鞋的脚沉重地踏在冷徹骨的泥漿裏，喳喳地嚮。在前邊有一個打玻璃風燈的，他趁這燈光走了一段路，轉到黑暗的巷裏，不外便到了他自已的家。</p>
<p>輕輕地，輕輕地，他推開了自已家的門。門裏是黑暗的。他熟悉地便向裏走。</p>
<p>他還没有到了自已的房裏，房裏便出來了一個女人的聲音，問道，</p>
<p>「誰？」問聲是在笑聲後發出的。</p>
<p>「我。」回答是乾枯的，聽慣了的。</p>
<p>「幹甚事？」問聲緊連地傳了出來，像是在問一個生客。</p>
<p>「拿烟的。」徐三明白了房裏有客在燒烟，就把步子放慢了。</p>
<p>「我拿來給你。」</p>
<p>於是徐三站住了。房裏的抽屜嚮了一下，又問「是多少錢的？」得了回答，　　又過了一會，他的妻三姑娘拿着燈盞出了房，黑暗的外室陡然明亮起來。</p>
<p>燈光照在約莫三十歲的半個面龐上，具有妖媚的將老的豔姿，却極冷淡地望了丈夫一眼。側面的影子映在牆上，牆上影子的後部是髻，影子摇了一下。　　「是誰？」接過烟包的徐三向妻低聲地問。</p>
<p>影子的嘴唇也動了，是極低的聲音。「胡益泰的汪朝奉。」</p>
<p>丈夫轉身走了。她招呼過「不要忘記了出烟灰」，丈夫哼了一聲走出後，她把大門推好，把房外照察了一下，便又回到房裏去了。</p>
<p>她把燈放到桌上，將火頭扭小了一點，替汪先生倒滿了茶，茶杯平穩地放在烟盤上，她就坐在汪朝奉的曲成角形的膝磕前。男的把左手支起了斜欠的身體，右手由她背後從她的衣襟下伸了上去，三姑娘趁勢斜靠在他身上。戲謔的笑聲發動在黄光中。</p>
<p>她站了起來，又在對面原先地位上躺下了。四個眼睛都看在有圓口的玻璃罩内的火頭上，好像這小小火頭的幽暗的趣味比都市上的電影還有趣。</p>
<p>男的邊說着，邊燒着烟，一切的動作都是從容的，而烟籤上那起脹泡的黑的小粒子在左手食指上轉動時却十分靈敏純熟。女的繼續着先前的話頭，說她和别一家女人吵嘴的故事，這是女人說不完的事，她說得津津有味。她向男子望了一眼，說，</p>

<p>— 密齋</p>
<p>「這種女子在好萊塢眞是太多了。他們走正門走不進的時候，就設法跟住一個明星，預備將來可以來一個遺棄的訴訟，至少可以給她們一個宣傳，作爲入影界的終南捷徑。有的時候，這種計劃居然成功了，於是其餘亦都效尤起來，以致造成了現在的局面，使好萊塢的男子們，没有一個人可以說是得有安全保障的。</p>
<p>「女人們的翻戲，眞是種類太多了。頂普通的一種是母女連檔法。比方你住在一家公寓裏，忽然一天隔壁搬了一家新街坊來，一個很和善的中年婦人，帶了一個女孩子。那女孩子看見了你，一定會說「噫，這太好了，能和一位大明星同住在一所房子裏。」她那種天眞爛漫的様子，使你不會疑心到她有什麽野心的。你或者將她們母女請了過來喝喝茶，或者帶她們遊遊攝影塲，或者竟介紹她那女孩子進了公司。要是她能够幹下去的話，那是再好没有了。但是尚是她不興，那她的母親就要說話了。你趕緊替她想法子；不然的話，她就誣賴你一下，告你一個什麽什麽罪名。到了那時，頂普通的辦法就是拿出你的支票本子出來開支票好了。在好萊塢這種母親太多了。她在後面，安排指揮一切，使你防不勝防，逃無可逃。</p>
<p>「大家都以爲大明星家裏的電話號碼，是絶對秘密的，但是機巧婦女們，總會設法尋出來的。或者你一天接到一個電話，對方是個女子，她說是誰誰介紹的。那時你一時亦無從加以證實，祇可以媽媽虎虎答應她的請求和她見面了。她來了，你或者發現了什麽什麽朋友介紹的話，都是假造的，但她自稱係崇拜你的一個影迷，你亦不便得罪好。或者你覺得她很乖巧，很有趣……她們差不多都是乖巧有趣的少女……那你就覺得無妨和她周旋周旋。慢慢地她漸漸露出口風，要和你需索皮大衣，珠寶等等東西了。你要是不答應，她會和你翻臉，咬你一口；要是答應了她，那亦無法塡她無厭的慾壑，所以就到了進退維谷的地步了。　　「有一次險極了。我正在攝影塲拍戲，旁邊站着一個女人，乎裏拿了紙簿和鉛筆。她說她要和我談話。我以爲她是新聞記者就答應她了。等到戲拍完了，我呌她再等十分鐘，預備自已去卸裝去。不意我剛進化裝室，她就跟了進來。她說她是見慣戲劇電影界的人的，所以看看更衣亦不要緊的。我信以爲眞，就在她面前脫下了戲衣。想不到她乘我一個不備，她自已亦將上下衣服一起都脫掉了。好的用意是什麽，我不得而知，不過我費了九牛二虎之力，纔把她勸走了。從此以後，我的化裝室，就進出鎖了起來。你想我對於女人，害怕不害怕。　　「說了半天，到底有什麽救濟的辦法呢？那簡捷是很難，原因，就是普通的人們，太容易受宣傳的欺騙，而疑惑到影星的人格上去了。俗語說的『無風不起浪』，在這裏是不適用的，好萊塢許多毁棄婚約的訴訟，完全是無風之浪。法庭裏當然是可以得到公道的，但是社會上的人却不等法庭的判决，而輕輕受了宣傳的影響了。因此一般影星們就不敢放棄了事業和前程去打官司，因爲日後卽使官司打贏，他的名氣已受了不潔之玷，而前途亦許因之而黯黑了。算來算去，他還是忍了一口氣，化些冤錢私自了結爲妙。但是敲詐恫嚇的罪惡，却就在此滋長，而一般男明星，亦就視與女子相交爲畏途了。」（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c319">評「光明之路」 <a href="#c319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— 沙思</p>
<p>在現社會中，普遍着兩種典型的生活，一是富有，不愁穿，吃，住，有快樂的家庭；一是貧窮，飢寒交迫，無處安身，家庭不但没有快樂，甚至還會家散人亡。一件藝術作品能抓着這様的典型的事實來表現，無疑是能給人以深刻的印象的。「光明之路」的作者以陳泰那様受經濟壓迫而妻亡子散的現實的事件來作題材，這様的努力，是值得欽佩的，不過作者在抓到了這様眞實的題材之後，却没有去一貫地寫實主義地處理它；失去了對於這様的題材應有的嚴肅認眞的態度。顧及小趣味，而加入些不必要又無眞實性的穿揷丨丨噱頭，如使陳泰去賣藥，來些噱頭，這不但没有充分的眞實性，並且對於以這様題材來作中心的作品，在全劇的發展，表現上都給予「不適合」的烙印。可是作者以富人之家的歌唱及吃大菜來對照陳泰的家，這對於本片的題旨的表現是有相當力量的，不過來得太多了一點。</p>
<p>還有些穿揷是很偶然的，這帶偶然性的事件，也是削弱全劇的發展，表現的力量和緊張性的。如陳泰在公園偶然拾報找職業，這種偶然對於陳泰失業恐慌的表現，却不見得有力：自然，我不是說陳泰不可看報找事；正相反，陳泰應有意地去找報看，這様表現豈不比那偶然拾報的表現來緊張有力得多嗎？</p>
<p>此外，如陳泰與失業工人在公安局（？）爭着自首；去西北開墾，都無充分眞實性。這對於本片全劇的發展和表現並没有注入多大的力量；特别是那去西北開墾的收塲，更顯得勉强。還有將失業工人變成盜賊，這也不能算是動人之筆，並不是說失業的工人在現社會中絶没有爲淪盜賊的；不過這様的情形究竟不是普遍的。凡抓着那特殊的，卽非典型的事件或性格來表現，在效果上是很成問題的了。</p>
<p>總之，本片因作者没有正面地處理他所採取的題材，眞實地表現那題旨，所以不能十分有力，成功一完整的作品。</p>
<p>不過在導演者的導演手法上和演員的表演上，還有相當成功的地方，這使本片也有它相當的力量。特别是鄭君里和談瑛的（談瑛的扮裝太年青）表演，以那種緩慢的Ｔempo來表現他們的角色，是再合適，再有力不過的技巧。不過談瑛在鄭君里意外地回來時，二下將門關上，不能恊調着鄭君里的Ｔempo應當是遲疑着慢慢把門掩上。如此便不致於顯出不諧和的痕跡來。諸如此例，還有很多。這是導演者相當負責的。還有鄭君里的化裝好像是舞台上的化裝，在銀幕　的化裝是不能那様粗草的，要比舞台化裝精細得多、才不致在銀幕上顯出痕跡來。</p>
<p>不過話還得重說一遍。這一影片雖然在後面最大的歪曲了現實然而在作者本意，决不會如此，何况我們已經從各方面證明了原作者使陳泰認清反帝戰爭是他們應有的「出路」，而因了某種關係才提出了這到西北去的口號的。</p>
<h3 id="c320">評「牛苑佳人」 <a href="#c320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— 李瓊</p>

<p>丨卡爾登丨</p>
<p>美國的西部影片像潮水般的湧進了中國電影市塲，這使中國觀衆非常熟悉的與它接觸着，我想他們對於西部影片本身，一定有了深刻的認識。同時在電影批評的領域中，也是無數次的指出了西部影片之社會根據。</p>
<p>不過在一連的回類的影片中，這「牛苑佳人」却最爲露骨了。它明白而大胆的寫出白人侵略土人的殘酷而横暴，土人們的牛皮，白人們成羣結隊横加搶刧，及後遇着圭人的反抗，於是他們又利用最新式的軍器將他們慘殺殆盡。我們看罷，在這裏還不可以證明作者之用意嗎？還不足以說明所謂武俠片的政治意義嗎？</p>
<p>當然，任何種美國影片，都不會缺乏女人與愛情的穿揷，在這裏我們假使我們不留意的話，少不了只能看到搶女人英雄好漢的威武，然而幾次的刧掠土人，以及最後的大衝突，無論如何，我們也不會忽略這重要的主題吧？</p>
<p>在演出方面，也許我們會給那不斷的騎馬射擊，不斷的緊張塲面所懾服。自然這不單獨是技術的好壞問題，假使我們不肯忽視内容與形式的密切的一致性，假使我們絶對相信形式是内容的表現，那末這技術的成功，便最充分的說明内容最大的毒害。</p>
<p>也許有人說，中國的觀衆，並不一定，受其毒害，只能看着那騎馬射擊的神妙，因爲我們並没有土人可以侵略，然而侵略的觀念是否不會在他們心中存在着呢？請讀者們三復思之。</p>
<h3 id="c321">評「菲洲孔果國」 <a href="#c321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— 流石</p>
<p>Ｋongo丨上海開映丨</p>
<p>看過這一影片之後，我深深感覺戰慄。看罷，這便是文明人性格的眞實的寫照。屠殺，殘酷的暴行。這是人類的本性嗎？祇有所謂文明人才會如此。</p>
<p>在這裏，作者充分的描寫文明人的欺詐自私，奸僞，殘酷。雖然他很聰明的解釋着說，這個主人公爲的是受了人們的欺侮，爲了復仇，而不惜採取極殘酷的報復手段。他誘惑敵人的女兒，他拘捕醫生。這些，在作者也許是惋惜主人公的人性的變態。然而他究竟是殘忍的，他的本性是自私的：當他發現了敵人的女兒卽是自身之骨肉的時候，他到底將她釋放了。在這裏，當然有另一種作用，那便是美國電影作者一貫的對於愛情之重視。爲的是她已經有了愛人，而情人又是如此鍾情於她，於是這殘酷的文明人，便一點也不躇躊的成全的她的幸隔。自然，這女人幸而是他自已的女兒，假使到底是敵人的女兒，那末他是否也爲了她的愛情而保存她的生命呢？</p>
<p>除此以外，我們再看罷，主人公到菲洲，不是很巧妙的征服了那一羣野人嗎？而且那一羣土人不是完全懾服於權威之下嗎？好罷，這裏說明了白種的文明人便是世界的主人，土人們始終是牛馬般的奴隷。於是被征服者便臣服於他們的主人，而文明便是人間的上帝。然而更可柏的便是所謂威德的誇張，這種掩蓋野蠻行爲的眞象，已成爲文明人最足矜持之處。然而到底主人公坦白的說出了：「這是我的權威所在，我的命令便是法律」；這還不是眞象暴露麽？</p>
<p>也許有人以爲這並不是眞實的記載，也許以爲並不會眞有如此國度存在，但是殘酷的帝國主義者不是全世界六分之五的統治者麽？尤其是我們中國人不是懾服於權威者的暴力之下，連呼吸也感覺悶窒麽？而是我們不是已經聽見全世界的奴隷們之反抗的呼號麽？丨這裏正是一個縮影。</p>
<p>此外，我還要說什麽呢？導演者是極聰明的顯出了殘暴者的威嚴，主角許斯頓，也充分的表現了那可怕的性格，使我們爲之戰慄。我們看了這一影片之後，還能够笑得出來嗎？在腦中，我常留着那惡魔們可怕的面影。</p>

<h3 id="c322">克利斯丁娜ＱueenChristina（十）（二） <a href="#c322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— 笏臣</p>
<p>奥森斯提那在一旁提醒他道：「閣下不是帶有貴國國王的親筆書嗎？」安東尼歐還是說不出話來，祇以手向他的侍從示意。那位侍從就將一個大信封，外面有絲帶縛好，還蓋了一顆大火漆印，呈交首相奥森斯提那，由奥森斯提那轉呈女王。安東尼歐這纔開口道：「小臣係敝國國王所派遣來此的特使。今有與兩國有關的大事向陛下奏聞，願陛下傾聽。」女王將那大信封交給了奥森斯提那，一面對着西班牙大使道：「不久内廷相見，那時再說好了。目前但請安心，敝國對於貴國君王，以及貴國君王的特使，都非常敬禮，應與儘量優遇也。」正式廷見卽此告終。安東尼歐鞠躬致謝着，亦退了下去。克利斯丁娜凝立目送着他出去。那狡獪的麥格納斯的心裏，看了那種的景象，已經一目了然。但是克利斯丁娜却還是一點都不覺得。</p>
<p>克利斯了娜在内廷私室裏，靜待着安東尼歐前來會見。侍從們一個一個跑進來，擺了許多酒菓之類的食品，外面複室裏，還有一班樂隊，奏着纖細的音樂。愛葩走了進來。她告訴克利斯丁娜，說度支大臣求見。克利斯丁娜拒絶不見，而愛葩則勸誡着。不過克利斯丁娜很堅决，愛葩祇可以誠惶誠恐的去回報麥格納斯了。麥格納斯因爲克利斯丁娜拒絶不見，未免恨恨於心。他在過着裏遲遲不去，靜待着西班大使來到。一回西班牙大使來了，他走上前假裝很客氣的寒暄着。他於有意無意之中，談到瑞典的天氣。他說：「敝國的天氣，祇有受慣的人經得住，於外國人是很不相宜的，所以我奉勸閣下要小心，自加保護纔好。」安東尼歐道：「閣下所說的，是恐嚇的話嗎？」麥格納斯帶着冷笑道：「這是一個忠告。」他的聲音，像一股冷風，直鑽到安東尼歐的心裏。不過愛葩已經從内室裏跑了出來，請他進去，所以他亦没有說什麽話，和麥格納斯一鞠躬，就跟着愛葩進去了。</p>
<p>使克利斯丁娜很感覺到失望的，是安東尼歐這次私室的相見，還是拘拘束束，極端正式的。每次克利斯丁娜要和他接近，好回到以前景况的時候，他就用極簡短的語言擋開了。他對着克利斯丁娜道：「敝國國王久聞陛下賢淑，特差小臣來此晋謁，藉通欵曲，並願與陛下聯結秦晋之好。」這使克利斯丁娜覺得驚駭了，因爲首相奥林斯提那雖然告訴過她，而她總以爲這次西班牙王派道遣特使來此，大約是爲修訂條約，或是關於藝術的事，萬萬想不到是來向她自已求婚的。她問安東尼歐道：「這就是你的使命嗎？」安東尼歐道：「敝國國王以至敬至誠之意，特命小臣前來求婚，務求陛下加以考慮容納。」克利斯丁娜發出很悲慘的聲音道：「你爲什麽這様待我苛刻呢？」安東尼歐道：「小臣居於使臣的地位，奉君命來此，不敢苛刻，亦不敢懷有什麽私見。」克利斯丁娜道：「難道我們從此以後，就這様假裝着我們之間，毫無關係的嗎？」（未完）</p>

<p>The Vanguard of the Jin Army Has Reached Huangyangmutou</p>
<p>Sun's Troops Deploy Defenses at Dengkou, Attempting to Resist</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Authorities Formulate a Suppression Plan, Which Will Be Implemented After Fu Receives Funds and Returns to the Vicinity of Suining Yuan; Personnel from Sun's Side Are Leaving Beiping One After Another. <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the handling of Sun's army, He Yingqin has been holding continuous meetings with various generals to discuss the plan for suppressing Sun's army. The general plan has been drafted, and the armies of the five provinces of Jin, Sui, Gan, Ning, and Qing will implement a general suppression within the next few days. Sun attempts to personally supervise his remaining troops in a final struggle in the short term, again pressing towards Ningxia. It is expected that fierce battles will occur again near Ning Yuan within the next few days. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military sources today received a telegram from Ma Hongkui of Ningxia stating that Sun is currently commanding at the front in person, and all his major forces are concentrating near Ningxia, seemingly preparing a large-scale attack on the city. It is feared that fierce battles will occur in the suburbs of Ning Yuan in the next few days. He also requested that the Jin-Sui army be urged to dispatch troops as soon as possible in order to jointly encircle and attack. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang, Hu, and Ji telegraphed Sun with final advice, but have not yet received a reply. Sun's attitude is difficult to predict. Sun's army, under Lu Fengnian, is now deploying defenses at Dengkou, attempting to resist the westward advance of the Jin-Sui troops. The vanguard of Zhao Chengshou's cavalry has already arrived at Huangyangmutou. Fu Zuoyi, due to the tense situation at the front, decided to leave Beiping on the 23rd to return to Sui and depart for the Hetao region to command military affairs. Jin Zunhua and Hu Jiesan left Beiping today separately, reportedly to reside temporarily in Tianjin. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi discussed the military plan against Sun's army, which has been largely decided. The Jin-Sui army is dispatching troops, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Currently, the cavalry at the front line has entered the territory of Ningxia, near Yangshumutou. The remaining troops are also advancing one after another. Due to the inconvenient land transportation west of Baotou, the infantry and artillery are proceeding more slowly. This morning, a telegram was received from the front stating that Sun has dispatched Lu Yongnian's troops to Dengkou Shensanggong to hastily construct defensive works. Currently, the cavalry has stopped at its destination, awaiting the arrival of the infantry and artillery before commencing the attack. A detailed list of expenses for the dispatch and supply of the Jin-Sui army has been submitted to the Military Sub-Committee, which is currently reviewing it. It is expected that the review will be completed today or tomorrow. I will return to Sui after receiving the funds. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun has not replied to the telegram from Pang and others. The clamor for a peaceful resolution has subsided. Personnel from Sun's side in Beiping are leaving one after another. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Yongchang stated that he did not attend today's routine meeting of the Military Sub-Committee due to a throat ailment. Regarding the suppression of Sun's army, after the Jin-Sui army was dispatched, the vanguard has now reached the area between Linhe and Dengkou. However, the area along the route from Dengkou to Ningxia is all wilderness, and military transportation is inconvenient. The authorities have agreed to allocate heavy-duty trucks for transportation. The military expenses have been received, and after Fu goes to the front, I will also leave Beiping and return to Taiyuan. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Day of the Puppet's Usurpation Seems to Have a Threatening Effect on Us.</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin plan to conduct field exercises along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line in Tangguantun, Liangwangzhuang, and Duhezhen, starting from March 1st. The headquarters of the garrison army sent a letter to the Japanese consulate, which forwarded it to the Hebei Provincial Government. The authorities believe that the Japanese military exercises on March 1st and Puyi's usurpation have deep meaning and seem to pose a threat to us. They dispatched diplomatic secretary Chen Dongsheng to reply to the Japanese consulate, stating that the Japanese military's actions are beyond the leased territory and that the people may be misled, and refused. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the day of the puppet Puyi's ascension to the throne, March 1st, the Japanese troops in Tianjin will hold exercises at Haiguang Temple, having already informed our side. Their intention is to demonstrate their strength to us. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) As the puppet Puyi's enthronement is approaching, Japanese and Korean vagrants residing in the Luan East war zone are colluding with traitors and fabricating various unfounded rumors in order to incite local people to respond. The people, not understanding the truth, feel quite uneasy. The Tangshan Public Security Bureau, fearing that it will affect local security, is not only strictly investigating the rumor-mongers but will also issue a public notice in the next few days to reassure the people.

<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming, after reporting in Beiping, is scheduled to come to Tianjin on the 24th to return to Tangshan. Before the 27th, he will go to Yuguan to meet with Iwaku to discuss the takeover of various passes of the Great Wall. The Political Committee ordered Tao to negotiate with the Japanese side on the takeover of a total of sixteen large and small passes of the Great Wall. There is no problem with the takeover of small passes where neither the Japanese nor we have stationed troops. For large passes such as Jieling, Jiumen, and Lengkou, the Japanese have already built barracks and stationed garrisons. Iwaku had previously indicated that the Great Wall line is not peaceful and that the return should be postponed. The remaining passes can be taken over by us. Regarding the police within Yuguan, the Japanese side allows them to be equipped only with short swords and pistols, and not to carry large guns. The number is limited to fifty. Tao Shangming was ordered to negotiate further to allow for an increase. Due to the inability to rush-produce the uniforms for the Yuguan police, they will temporarily wear the old ones. After spring warms up, our uniforms will be changed. After our side takes over the various passes of the Great Wall, long-distance telephones will be installed. The cost is set at 80,000, which will be implemented after the provincial government meeting approves it. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The opinions on the Mongolian autonomy plan have been concentrated through Zhuang, Wang, Dai, and others exchanging telegrams back and forth, and a specific decision can be made soon. Wang also scheduled to summon Mongolian representatives on the 23rd to explain the general meaning of the modifications. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Taibao, a representative from Inner Mongolia, said that he went to the Executive Yuan yesterday to petition and was received by Chu Minyi. According to him, the principles of Mongolian autonomy are still under consideration and may be submitted for approval at the Central Political Council next Wednesday. Before it is officially announced, the Executive Yuan will send personnel to consult with us to exchange opinions, and then promulgate it so that both parties can achieve satisfactory results. Chu indicated that even so, it is not certain whether it will satisfy the hopes of the Mongolian people at that time. Outer Mongolia has already been communized by Soviet Russia, and Inner Mongolia is under the violent environment of the Japanese puppets, and its situation is also precarious. If we do not rise up and save ourselves urgently and strive to become stronger at this time, then the territory of Inner Mongolia will be seen to be invaded by Japan and I am afraid it will no longer be ours. Regarding this point, I also presented it together yesterday, hoping to make every effort to assist in order to consolidate the border. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e38">British Troops Invade the Hulutou (Gourd King) Territory on the Yunnan Border <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Kunming Dispatch: Last December, more than two thousand British soldiers entered the Ban Nong area on the Yunnan border. Everywhere they went, they built roads. Common talk suggests that their intention is to urgently seize the gold mines of my Ban Hong (i.e., Ban Hong). However, it is unknown whether they have other intentions besides seizing the gold mines. Mr. Li Jingsen of Yunnan Province once went to Ban Hong to investigate mining affairs twice. According to his report, Ban Hong is located in a remote area on the Yunnan border, and together with Yongbang, Banlao, and Bie Shaoxing, they are known as the Hulutou (Gourd King) Territory. The Hulutou (Gourd King) Territory was originally divided into upper and lower parts. Ban Kuang and other places belonging to the Lower Hulutou (Gourd King) were allowed to be abandoned when the Sino-Burmese border treaty was signed in the Qing Dynasty. What remains now is only the Upper Hulutou (Gourd King) Territory, which is located in the southwest of Yunnan Province, northwest of Gongming Mountain, bordering British Burma to the west, Shuangjiang to the east, Mengding Gengma to the north, and Lancang Menglian to the south. It has a population of nearly one million and an area of several thousand square miles, almost one-sixth of the total area of Yunnan Province. The climate is mild, the land is fertile, and the products are abundant. Gold and silver mineral resources are especially rich. However, the people have very low knowledge, and they are ignorant and unaware of the outside world.</p>
<p>Chinese people have always been indifferent to the situation on the border. Yunnan, being located at the remote end of the sky, is even regarded as insignificant. Since the loss of the Northeast, the court and the public have begun to pay attention to border defense after the pain has subsided. However, their attention is still mostly focused on the Northwest and neglects the Southwest. Even speaking of Yunnan Province, it is squeezed between the two great powers of Britain and France, and the situation has been critical for a long time. However, what we know is the loss of Jiangxinpo and Pianma, but we do not know that there is still the so-called Hulutou (Gourd King) Territory. The border situation is so blurred and obscured to such an extent, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>Now, we dare to loudly warn the people of the country: Yunnan is the link between India and the Yangtze River. The British have long harbored the intention to enter Yunnan from India, penetrate Sichuan, spy on Tibet, and sweep the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Therefore, their advance into Jiangxinpo and Pianma, as well as their invasion and occupation of the Hulutou (Gourd King) Territory, may be a manifestation of their consistent policy. Yao Wendong once said about Yunnan that it has the potential to overturn the entire country. Its gains and losses are actually related to the security of the whole country. In recent times, Min Weiren also said, "Yunnan occupies the upper reaches of various provinces and has the potential to overturn the entire country. Entering Sichuan from Yunnan means occupying the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Passing through Guizhou to Huangping Yuanjiang to reach Hunan means being able to control the north. As for heading east to Guangxi, along the Xijiang River downstream, it means occupying the Pearl River basin." He also quoted Liu Weiyuan's words, "China is like a melon, and Yunnan is like the stem of the melon. If the stem of the melon is rotten, then the whole melon will be rotten." Understanding this, we know that this warning is of great significance, and the future response should be based on the overall southwest border defense as the focus. Based on this understanding, we dare to offer the following suggestions to our authorities: (1) Diplomatic aspects: The reason why diplomatic disputes on the Yunnan border have arisen in the past is due to unclear border affairs. According to Article 3 of the Sino-British Burma Treaty of the twelfth year of Guangxu (1886) in the late Qing Dynasty, the Sino-Burmese border should be jointly surveyed and demarcated by officials from China and Britain. Subsequently, officials from both sides negotiated and made several revisions to the border affairs. Regarding the southern section of the border, Article 3 of the Sino-British Supplementary Treaty of the twenty-third year of Guangxu (1897) clearly states that from the line where the Nanwan River and the Ruili River meet to Gengma Mengding, which belongs to Shun Ning, following the boundary line between Jiangchang and Jianghong to the Meijiang River area, the latitude and longitude are clearly stated and can be examined in detail. The following year, Liu Wansheng, the town general of Tengyue, and others, together with the British Consul Bavier, conducted a survey of Zhenbian Menglian Shanming Mountain and other places in accordance with the provisions of the original treaty. Unexpectedly, the British Consul wanted to arbitrarily designate Kongming Mountain (the watershed between the Nanka River and the Nanlei River) as the Gongming Mountain in the treaty (southeast of the Lujiang River, south of the Gun River), so that the boundary line would advance eastward. According to his words, not only would the Hulutou (Gourd King) Territory not belong to us, but also Maoshou Ximeng Guande Yongguang Mannong and other places belonging to Lancang would also be merged into Burma. Our side argued strongly with him because the British Consul was clever at homophony and disregarded the facts. As a result, the demarcation of that section of the boundary line and the section of the boundary line north of the 25 degrees 35 minutes latitude of the Jian Gao Mountain remain as unresolved cases. Since the demarcation of the boundary affairs has not been properly handled, the British see it as an opportunity to take advantage of. Regarding the incident of British troops entering Ban Nong this time, our government should quickly investigate the truth and negotiate with Britain. However, in order to fundamentally eliminate the problem once and for all, it is necessary to catch up urgently. On the one hand, study the old treaties and documents on border demarcation and the writings of personnel related to border demarcation, such as Zeng Jize, Xue Fucheng, and Yao Wendong, as the basis for historical facts. On the other hand, select capable personnel and send them to the border area to carefully survey and map in detail, and assess the evolution and current situation of the British invasion of the border as a preparation for actual negotiations. Only then can we urge the British side to open border demarcation negotiations, so that we can be prepared and avoid the difficulty of temporary constraints. If border disputes can be resolved, southwest national defense can be worry-free.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic affairs: The strategy for diplomatic response is nothing more than this. However, domestic rectification is even more complicated. At this time when strong neighbors are pressing us, we should choose the most important things and start with them first, and then gradually expand. We believe that what is urgently needed and cannot be delayed in rectifying southwest border affairs today is: (A) Implementing a policy of military reclamation by soldiers. This matter not only greatly benefits border defense, but also opens up a huge final outlet for the redundant troops in the country. (B) Spreading our country's written language and language so that the local natives all know that they are descendants of China and strengthen their hearts of internal attachment. Fortunately, the indigenous people are very eager to be like the Han Chinese, so it is not very difficult to make them naturalize and become attached. As Li Jingsen reported, the Hulutou (Gourd King) and others once said that the Ban Hong mines must be opened by the Great Han Dynasty, otherwise they will unite with the various kings to resist with all their strength and will never give up easily. This kind of psychology can be greatly utilized. (C) Western Yunnan has a sparse population and vast land. It seems that another province should be established, with the provincial capital located in Dali. Once the administrative area is reduced, local affairs can be handled nearby. There is no need for complicated procedures for reporting to the local area, and the central government is spared the difficulty of being too far away to be effective. Also, the Tusi (chieftains) of western Yunnan should also be changed to county governance, directly under the provincial government, in order to prevent the British from using coercion and inducements. (D) The British have railways in Burma's Labu, Bhamo New Street, Myitkyina and other places. Economic aggression is their guide wire. Once something happens, it is more convenient to transport troops and send generals. Compared with our side's traffic obstruction and border ignorance, the two cannot be compared. Now, in order to consolidate national defense and develop the border area, building roads is the most urgent task.</p>
<p>The danger of southwest border defense today is no less than that of the Northeast. We dare not raise the alarm. The situation is like this, how can we remain silent? Jiangxinpo and Pianma have already been lost one after another, and the aftermath is heavy. I don't know what will happen in the end. If we negotiate with the British on the invasion and occupation of the Hulutou (Gourd King) Territory, it will only be a gain or loss in one corner. The gains and losses in one corner should be strived for, but the safety of the whole situation should be paid more attention to.</p>

<p>Vienna: The riots of the Socialist Party have been quelled. Dr. Dollfuss, the prime minister, has ordered that all martial law throughout the country be lifted from 7:00 a.m. this morning. The military tribunals organized during the riots to try the rebels will continue to work, but it seems that no death penalty will be imposed except for the ringleaders.

<p>(Berlin) Habicht's radio speech at the Munich Radio Station yesterday was nothing short of a letter of ultimatum to Austria. Now his speech has been removed from the German press release and has not been made public to the public. Judging from this, the German authorities do not seem to agree with Habicht's remarks. According to the Vienna newspaper's Berlin correspondent, he asked several German officials for their opinions on Habicht's remarks, but they all remained silent. Berlin considers Habicht's speech to be inappropriate and fears that it will lead to the loss of his own position. Vienna considers Habicht's speech to be a challenge to the three powers of Britain, France, and Italy, who have solemnly declared and guaranteed Austria's independence. According to Habicht's speech, he made conditions to the Austrian government, and said that if they were not fulfilled by the end of the month, he would double his efforts to continue attacking Austria. Austrian Deputy Prime Minister Fei issued an important statement to the press, stating that if Germany recognizes Austria's independence, the Austrian government can understand and cooperate with other countries.

Fifty members of the Conservative Party supported this amendment, and another hundred members did not vote. This amendment was finally rejected by 177 votes to 125 votes.

<p>To Be Implemented After Budget Balance</p>
<p>(Paris) Former Minister of Commerce Leinard stated in the Privy Council today that the value of the franc is likely to continue to fall. He said that the depreciation of the franc is inevitable unless the cost of industrial products is reduced or the French budget is balanced. Otherwise, there is no other way, because the current absorption of huge amounts of gold by the United States has the greatest impact on the value of the franc. The current Minister of Finance Martin said that the government will never reduce the value of the franc, nor will it abandon the gold standard. French bankers unanimously stated that France has a large amount of cash reserves, with 74,882,707,000 francs. Although it has been repeatedly exported abroad recently, it still has no impact on the value of the franc. It is expected that after the budget is balanced, France will immediately prohibit the outflow of cash abroad. The reasons for the recent instability of the franc are: first, due to the absorption of cash by the United States; second, due to the impact of the Daladier political storm; and third, since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, the French people have been worried about Germany attacking France. Furthermore, the recent stability of the currencies of the Netherlands and Switzerland and the continuous inflow of French gold into the Netherlands and Switzerland are also major reasons for the instability of the franc.

<p>(Minli) Today, Minister of Finance Maddan announced the French government's financial policy in the House of Representatives, saying that in short, this policy is to adjust domestic and foreign prices, rather than engage in the manipulation of the national currency. The high domestic prices are due to the protection of French agriculture and the result of the war. The government should adopt the least painful method to restore the country's greatest activity, but merely reducing the value will not adjust prices. When the Minister of Finance spoke in the House of Representatives, the Senate passed a bill to increase the tea tax from 3.54 francs per kilogram to 7.75 francs. The purpose of this move is to protect tea producers in French territories such as Vietnam. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies began discussing the budget bill this afternoon. The procedure is to review the entire budget bill without discussing it chapter by chapter. This has been decided by the parliament. Reporter Yager said that the Finance Committee advocates that the budget bill should be completely balanced. The income for this year reached 48,622,000,000 francs, and the initial deficit has been offset. This should be attributed to the various measures taken in the past 20 months. Otherwise, the 1933 budget would have a deficit of 14,000,000,000 francs, and the 1934 budget would have a deficit of 16,000,000,000 francs. The balance of the 1934 budget is indeed a fact. The various measures to reorganize finance are also calculated very practically, and the income estimates are not very high. The reporter also said that in order to maintain the balance of the future budget, we must save expenditures and not allow them to continue to increase, especially railway expenditures. Yager concluded that financial problems are only one aspect of the economic situation. To improve the economy, we must find ways to improve the balance of foreign trade. The discussion point in the Chamber of Deputies immediately shifted to how to maintain the balance of the future budget. Congressman Lelu proposed that expenditures should be tightened and finally said that he would honestly support the government, and members of the right-wing and central parties applauded. Minister of Finance Aman Maddan agreed with this idea and insisted that it is necessary to rationalize railway and land transportation. The budget balance problem should be solved in a comprehensive manner. Domestic and foreign prices should be adjusted, and borrowing interest rates should be reduced. The Minister of Finance also reported that the government will submit a draft law on the financial management of social insurance undertakings, and will also submit a plan for large-scale public works. The general discussion in the Chamber of Deputies then came to an end, and active discussions on the fiscal law began, and the first five articles were passed. The meeting will be held three times tomorrow to continue the discussion in order to complete it quickly. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Rumors are circulating that the parliament may be dissolved or a "parliamentary recess" may be announced after the budget bill is voted on. Today, the Radical Socialist Party issued a statement declaring that the party has decided to oppose these two measures. The Radical Socialist Party has taken this attitude because it has reached a secret compromise with the opposing right-wing parties, because if a general election is held, it will be very unfavorable to them.

<p>Men, Women, and Children Line Up</p>
<p>Waiting for One Mile From Dawn</p>
<p>Funeral Held, Striving for Simplicity</p>
<p>Brussels: The funeral of the late King of Belgium is scheduled to be held tomorrow. Those who came here from all over the country to offer condolences are like water rushing to a valley. The King's remains are now laid in state in the Imperial Palace. The Belgian people who went to the Palace to pay their final respects to their late King are constantly on the road. Yesterday, late at night, there were still thousands of men, women, and children, lining up for a mile, waiting quietly to pass the Imperial coffin in order. Among them, there were those who came from distant villages and set out before dawn yesterday.</p>
<p>King Albert had expressed his wish before his death that after he reached 100 years old, he should be buried in the Regal Imperial Mausoleum, without any ceremonies. However, the Belgian government now feels it is necessary to hold a state funeral, while the ceremonies should be kept as simple as possible. The Imperial coffin will be moved from the Palace to the Saint Gudule Cathedral tomorrow to sing mass songs, and then moved back to the Regal Imperial Mausoleum for the funeral.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters correspondent in Berlin, President Hindenburg and the German government will be represented by Mr. Keller of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer condolences in Beijing. It is heard that the former German Crown Prince was eager to attend the ceremony and had signaled to the Belgian government, but the Belgian government did not respond.</p>
<p>Nine aircraft of the British Royal Air Force will escort the Crown Prince from London to Beijing today to represent the British Emperor at the ceremony. The Commander of the Fleet, General Keyes, and an officer of the Royal Air Force, and twenty-five noncommissioned officers will also go to Beijing by sea and land to participate in the funeral.

<p>Brussels: The Flemish Nationalist members of the Belgian House of Representatives decided not to attend the new King's inauguration ceremony. The other day, when the parliament praised the achievements of the late King, they left the chamber to express their extreme opinions. According to a member, they made this decision because the Flemish nation has nothing to do with the purely Belgian ceremony, and because the Prime Minister praised the late King in the chamber in French instead of Flemish. The extremists of the Flemish nation may hold demonstrations when the new King is inaugurated, but if they do so, they will be expelled. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>But Believes It Does Not Constitute a Criminal Act</p>
<p>Rumors of 130 Assemblymen Accepting Bribes are Untrue</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Justice Koyama has submitted the preliminary examination record of Fujita Kozaburo regarding the Sakhalin Industries incident to the Okamoto Investigation Committee through Speaker Akita. The main points are as follows: 230,000 yen was given to Hatoyama in two or three installments of 10,000 yen each, presumably in return for his support of the Seiyukai party. No other money was given to Hatoyama. According to Mori Kaku, as introduced by Hatoyama, 50,000 yen was given to Okamoto Ichiji at the end of January in the third year of Showa [1928] to support the general election. Additionally, 100,000 yen was given to Hamaguchi Yuko through former Sakhalin Governor Masatani Akira, and 50,000 yen was given to Yamamoto Teijiro of the Seiyukai party through Secretary Isaka for election expenses. The above two amounts were paid from the company's logging account. 20,000 yen was given to Isaka in July or August of the third year of Showa, paid from the forestry account. (21st Day, Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Inquiry Committee requested the submission of the prosecutor's investigation documents regarding the Sakhalin Industries incident. Minister of Justice Koyama submitted it to today's Cabinet meeting for publication. It is now clear that Minister of Education Hatoyama received money from Fujita Kozaburo of Sakhalin Industries. However, Minister Hatoyama stated that the money was Fujita's private funds and does not constitute a criminal act. (21st Day, Japan United Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Day Three of the Inquiry Committee <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives Inquiry Committee investigating Representative Okamoto held its third meeting at 11:10 this morning. Today, due to the publication of evidentiary documents related to the Sakhalin Scandal, the tension at the venue is increasing as the truth regarding Minister Hatoyama's discipline problem is being investigated. Noda Bunjiro of the National Alliance spoke first, saying:</p>
<p>This committee has requested the presence of Railway Minister Mitsuchi, Education Minister Hatoyama, and Finance Minister Takahashi, but they have not attended. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Committee Chairman Shimada replied:</p>
<p>The government has notified us that the three ministers will attend the committee at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>Noda then argued that the dispositions of the Japanese artificial silk and Kobe Steel Works incidents were improper and explained in detail the relationship between Kaneko Naokichi, Sumida, and Railway Minister Mitsuchi. Afterwards, Shiga Watari of the Seiyukai party stated:</p>
<p>Representative Okamoto's remarks regarding me are not consistent with the facts. I have never received a report from Minister Hatoyama regarding the handling of the Sakhalin incident. Representative Okamoto's remarks are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>After Shiga finished speaking, Morita Masayoshi of the Seiyukai party demanded that Okamoto retract his words. Next, Taniyama Kohei of the Minseito party stated that every word spoken by Representative Okamoto in the committee is evidence and important material for political judgment. Therefore, he hopes that Representative Okamoto will freely disclose the truth of the incident. He read the verbatim record of Representative Okamoto's speech, which stated that he intended to make it public this year. However, because he was refuting the impromptu remarks of various representatives, he inadvertently revealed those words. When Representative Okamoto was asked what he thought about the bribery incident involving 130 assemblymen last year, Okamoto replied:</p>
<p>There was some regret due to the jeering of many people in the assembly hall and being dominated by the excited atmosphere. However, I was indignant about this issue and suspicious about the source of the current funds for those who notified me of the fact that a large amount of money was distributed. Therefore, I made the notification. I also believe that this matter is a fact. The number of 130 assemblymen may have a few errors, or it may not be known. Taniyama asked:</p>
<p>What kind of reward did Representative Okamoto receive from Minister Hatoyama for the matters handled by Representative Okamoto regarding the Sakhalin incident, which is a very serious criminal case?</p>
<p>Okamoto replied:</p>
<p>I have often been depressed and my state of mind has been very uneasy since this case occurred, but I have never received any reward.</p>
<p>Ueda Kokichi of the Seiyukai party, with a slightly indignant expression, said to Okamoto:</p>
<p>Is there concrete evidence for the distribution of money to 130 Seiyukai assemblymen? Please list the names of the assemblymen.</p>
<p>Okamoto replied:</p>
<p>I cannot disclose them.</p>
<p>At half-past twelve, the chairman announced a recess.</p>
<p>The Inquiry Committee continues to be the focus of public attention. The meeting resumed at 2:15 this afternoon. At that time, Hatoyama Hideo, the Minister of Education's younger brother, was suddenly seen sitting in the audience. First, Fujita Wakasui asked:</p>
<p>Representative Okamoto, as a member of the Seiyukai party, has a pre-existing determination to leave the party in order to expose the wrongdoings of his colleagues. We are very surprised by this action and even have doubts. What is the source of Representative Okamoto's state of mind? Please explain.</p>
<p>Okamoto replied:</p>
<p>Disruption of discipline is very concerning. Therefore, I requested President Suzuki in writing on January 20 to find a way to eliminate discipline.</p>
<p>Fujita then asked:</p>
<p>In the past, Representative Okamoto and Hatoyama jointly committed evidence destruction and repented to take action to eliminate discipline. Is there anything more you are planning to come up with this time?</p>
<p>Okamoto replied:</p>
<p>I have no intention of deliberately harming others.</p>
<p>Fujita claimed:</p>
<p>It is certainly appropriate to crack down on those who disrupt discipline, but it is not appropriate for a warm-blooded human being to ruin the reputation of others without cause. Is the so-called 130 people receiving money from Hatoyama hearsay and an exaggeration?</p>
<p>At this time, Committee Chairman Shimada announced a statement of clarification:</p>
<p>We have just received a letter from Ino Mori, who is from the Seiyukai party (the person Representative Okamoto said he heard it from). Regarding Representative Okamoto's remarks, they are not factual and have already been clarified.</p>
<p>After reading the statement, it is sufficient to prove that what Okamoto said was entirely fictitious. In addition, Yoshiichi Kuboi, who was said to have submitted the diagram, also sent a letter requesting the cancellation of Representative Okamoto's statement and read the letter. The committee members then questioned Okamoto:</p>
<p>Please tell us the names of the people that Representative Okamoto mentioned who had an agreement beforehand and were not convenient to mention.</p>
<p>Next, Takeyasu of the Minseito party requested the submission of documents regarding the disposition of Taiwan Bank stock issues. At this time, Committee Chairman Shimada announced:</p>
<p>The questioning of Representative Okamoto can generally be considered complete. Now we will question Eto Genkuro, but there is very little time left and it can be done next time.</p>
<p>Minister of Justice Koyama also made a brief statement at this time. The meeting was adjourned at 4:05. (21st Day, Japan United Dispatch)</p>

<p>Russia Declares Japanese Fishing Vote Invalid</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received by the Russian Fisheries Association here at 11:00 PM on the 20th, the Russian side declared that all votes cast by Japanese fishermen in the North Pacific fishing area vote held in Vladivostok on the 20th were invalid. Japanese fishermen first issued Federal National Bank checks at a ratio of 3.225 Japanese yen per ruble to serve as a deposit, with an explanatory note attached during the voting. However, when the Soviet Far East Fisheries Commissioner read the ballots, he declared the votes of the Japanese companies invalid on the grounds that the deposit checks issued by Japanese merchants, calculated according to the National Bank's conversion rate, were less than half of the rent. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received a public telegram regarding the report of the vote in the Russian-controlled fishing area. Japanese merchants participated in the vote based on the Russo-Japanese Agreement, but the Russian side declared the Japanese merchants' votes invalid and implemented its unilateral vote. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers this a violation of the treaty and has decided to issue a strong protest to the Russian government immediately after the public telegram arrives. The content is as follows: (1) The Russian side's unilateral implementation of the vote with a conversion rate of 75 kopecks not only violates the agreement signed by Foreign Minister Kijuhara and Tiranovsky in 1931, but also violates the Russo-Japanese Fisheries Treaty. (2) Japan cannot recognize such an illegal vote result. The Russian side's intention is to take this opportunity to raise the Russo-Japanese exchange rate, but Japan considers this a violation of the treaty and demands its withdrawal. (3) Japan has always insisted on implementing the vote at an exchange rate of 3.225 yen. The Russian side should bear the responsibility for any problems arising from the violation of the treaty. Japan will consider methods of free fishing in Russian territory depending on how the incident develops. (21st Day, Japan United Dispatch)</p>

<p>Minting Coins to Promote Trade with China</p>
<p>(Washington) During the discussion of the Silver Bill in the Senate Banking and Currency Committee today, two currency experts strongly argued that using silver as currency would greatly benefit China. Leon, a New York silver expert, said that adopting silver currency would affect the value of Chinese goods and exports, but China would benefit from it soon after because this move could prevent British and Japanese capitalists from controlling Chinese commerce. He also said that this would raise world prices and encourage countries to adopt silver currency. De Longt, a New York statistics expert, agreed to set the ratio of silver to gold at 12 to 1, saying that this is the natural ratio of the two metals. He also said that the United States should mint silver coins similar to Mexican silver dollars, which could also be used in China and could increase US foreign trade, not only with the Far East and China. After the price of silver increases, US trade with China will definitely increase, China's economic situation can gradually become prosperous, and it can purchase foreign goods in large quantities.

<p>More than a Thousand Kawa Soldiers in Ban Hong Area Prepare to Resist</p>
<p>In mid-December of last year, seven or eight British individuals suddenly arrived in the Ban Hong area on the Yunnan border, convened a meeting of local people, and subsequently more than two thousand British troops arrived, bringing equipment and tools to build a motor road. The situation was already reported in yesterday's newspaper, Yunnan News. Now we record the news from the China United Press as follows:</p>
<p>In December of last year, seven or eight British individuals suddenly appeared in the Ban Nong area and convened a secret meeting of the people there. After four or five months of meetings, they dispatched more than two thousand British soldiers, all carrying working tools. Wherever they went, they repaired the roads to make them passable for motor vehicles. They are currently building an iron bridge on the banks of the Ban Nong River. General opinion is that they intend to quickly seize the metals of our Ban Hong. Summarizing the above news, it is confirmed that the British are implementing mining by force. It is now heard that more than a thousand Kawa soldiers have been mobilized in the Ban Hong area to prepare for resistance, and the situation is extremely tense.</p>
<p>The Ban Hong incident is entirely consistent with the past Zhuang Ma negotiations in Jiangxinpo. The area of Meng Gong in Myitkyina, northern Burma under British control, has always produced the world-famous Fei Cui jade. Since the three wonders of Fei Cui at the Chicago Exposition caused a worldwide sensation, it has further aroused the ambitions of the British. Furthermore, it has been found that in the Myitkyina area, in addition to setting up factories to mine gold and jade, the British have also built roads to the banks of the Nujiang River on the Yunnan border in no less than dozens of places. The Nanding River bank already has post roads that directly reach the Yixi Avenue from Kunlian and Dali to Chuxiong in central Yunnan. Even walking to Kunming city would only take five or six days. The British, under the guise of mining, are actually secretly carrying out their important transportation plans. Currently, the disputes in Kangzang (Kham and Tibet), southern Xinjiang, etc., are all related to the British. Our government naturally cannot ignore this negotiation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially appointed Wang Yumei, the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs stationed in Yunnan, to forward a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Xu Jian, our consul in Yangon (Burmese capital), instructing him to personally inspect the place of illegal mining and assist in the negotiations. Recently, a telegram was received from Li Yuegai, the Director-General of Yixi, which stated, "Commissioner Wang, your telegram is noted. Bian Mi is free to act, and in fact there is nothing to be done. However, no matter which line, we have the right to speak within the undetermined border (omitted). As for the location of the Maolong factory at that time, most were in Ban Hong, and some were within the current jurisdiction of Gengma. The detailed sections of the yellow line's passage are difficult to investigate suddenly. In addition to urgently ordering the Zhenkang county magistrate to supervise Gengma Guisi in a detailed investigation, drawing, and reporting, I respectfully reply. I pray that it be presented to the Chairman for review, and I request a telegram to Director-General Yang to instruct Shuangjiang and Lancang to supervise Mengjiao Dong, Xijian, Mengda, and other Tusi to investigate and report. Your younger brother Li Yuegai (31st) seal." (China United</p>
<h3 id="e94">General Situation of Huluwang Area <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>(Li Jingsen)</p>
<p>Yesterday's important news reported the alarm of British troops invading the Yunnan border. The true nature of the content is not yet fully known. However, the perilousness of the Yunnan border has long been noted by people in Yunnan. The Fudian Bank sent Mr. Li Jingsen to the Huluwang area last year (1933) in January to investigate the mining area situation. According to his report upon returning to the province, the area occupies one-sixth of the entire Yunnan province and has rich reserves. Foreigners have coveted it for a long time. It is related to national defense and mining in every way, and our country should promptly plan for its development. Then the importance of the problem can be known. We Chinese only know that the Northeast has Huludao, but we do not know that the Southwest has the even more important Huluwang area. Now we specifically look for and record Mr. Li's investigation of the general situation as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e95">Introduction <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Since the success of the Northern Expedition, especially after the September 18th Incident, more and more Chinese people have paid attention to border construction. From the perspective of the country's future, can this not be called a good phenomenon? However, the vision of the Chinese people is not comprehensive, paying attention to the Northwest but not to the Southwest, especially not valuing Yunnan, which is located between the two. Moreover, considering the situation of the Yunnan border, the general public also has biases, only knowing about the loss of Jiangxinpo and Pianma, but not knowing that the Huluwang area, which is located in the southwest, has fallen into a dangerous state. It is also a region rich in mineral products and fertile land, which cannot but be regretted.</p>
<p>The Huluwang area originally had upper and lower divisions. The Ban Kuang and other places belonging to the lower Huluwang were, due to the ignorance of the authorities, allowed to be划歸 in the border agreement and are now only the upper Huluwang area. It is located in the southwestern corner of the province, northwest of Gongming Mountain, bordering British Burma to the west, Shuangjiang to the east, Mengding and Gengma to the north, and Lancang and Menglian to the south. The area is thousands of square miles, with a population of nearly one million. The climate is mild, the soil is fertile, and the products are abundant, especially gold and silver mineral products. However, the people have very low awareness, are ignorant and confused, know nothing of the outside world, still eat raw meat and drink blood, and even live in caves and wilderness, remaining in a primitive state.</p>
<p>The Huluwang area is currently divided and governed by five kings, namely Ban Hong, Shui Bang, Ban Lao, Kwong Bie, and Shao Xing, with King Shao Xing as the chief king. The area has always belonged to our country. At the end of the Han Dynasty, Kongming's southern expedition and the Ming Dynasty's Wang Ji's expedition to Burma both reached this country with their power and virtue. Even after hundreds of years, the people still worship Kongming and Wang Ji. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, the government established formal and deputy magistrates to govern the area. At the same time, Wu Shangxian from Shiping went to Ban Hong to open the Maolong Silver Factory, and Gongli Yan went to Ban Kuang to mine the Laoyin Factory, both of which achieved great success. Later, due to poor politics, it was advisable to report failure. As of today, Ban Kuang is owned by the British, and the old silver factory has been mined using new methods, while Maolong is still abandoned. During the Qianlong period, due to the mining relationship, the relationship between the Huluwang area and the hinterland of the province can be said to be the closest. Unfortunately, the government at that time lacked vision and failed to timely implement political education and guide the people of the area. In the twelfth year of Guangxu (1886), Burma fell to the British, and the Huluwang area became one of the border lands, and its position became increasingly important. In the twenty-eighth year of the Qing Dynasty, the Governor-General of Yunnan and Guizhou, Wang Wenshao, and the Finance Commissioner, Liu Chunlin, summoned the King of Ban Hong to the province, bestowed clothing and other items, and explained the government's kindness, ordering him to return to his homeland to guard it. Later, when unrest occurred in the area, Peng Yaonan (from Mianning) was ordered to garrison the area for many years and was deeply respected by the five kings and the people. His prestige still exists today. Since the Republic of China, the government has not forgotten to be kind to distant lands and has sent officials several times to express condolences, but those sent were not always suitable, not only failing to fulfill their missions but also having a bad influence on the border people. The civilization of the Huluwang area has not yet begun, which is truly regrettable. No matter from the historical, ethnic, or other aspects, there is no doubt that the area should belong to our country. However, the British, knowing its abundant mineral resources and excellent land, coveted it and, in the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu, when surveying the border, claimed that the latitude and longitude of Xuetou did not match the treaty, forcibly designated Kongming Mountain as Gongming Mountain, and drew a red line on another map, penetrating more than a hundred miles into our interior. According to the British map, not only would the Huluwang area not belong to us, but also Maoshou, Ximeng, Guangman Nong, and other places belonging to Lancang would also belong to the British, resulting in significant losses for our side. The request was immediately rejected, and it remains a pending issue to this day. However, over these decades, British aggression has been continuous. They have sent personnel to secretly observe the situation in the area at any time. Their most coveted object is the Maolong silver mine, because not only are the mineral reserves abundant, but even the tailings have thick profits to be made. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the Ban Kuang British Burma Silver Mining Company moved merchants to come and buy the mine tailings, paying as much as ten British dollars per hundred catties. If the ore was not of excellent quality, they would not have offered such a price. Fortunately, the local people were loyal to the Han and did not please the British, so they immediately stopped it. Although they wanted to invade, they suffered from having no way. However, although the local people rejected the British and leaned towards the Han, the Hui people in Ban Nong were willing to be lackeys and serve as vanguards, invading internally, which is also a major crisis in the five kings' territories. It is said that the Hui people in Ban Nong migrated here during the Du Wenxiu era. The area is under the jurisdiction of King Ban Lao, who married the Hui people's Ma Wanquan as his son-in-law. Gradually, the king's power fell to the side, and when Ma's son Bicang arrived, he even drove the king out and seized his position, calling himself the Ban Nong official. The area borders British Burma, and the economic relationship between the two places is very close, so the Hui people are mostly lured by the British, forgetting their ancestors and willing to be the dogs of the British, standing in opposition to the five kings. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, the Hui people in Ban Nong plotted to attack the five kings, but fortunately, Peng Yaonan, the commander of the Lancang border defense camp, stopped them. If our side does not increase its border defense forces in the future, then a large-scale internal attack by the Hui people is a foreseeable event.</p>
<p>The author lives in Mianning, close to the area, and is deeply aware of the border crisis. He constantly thinks of ways to serve the country. Moreover, because Mr. Peng Yaonan, whose reputation shook the five kings, has a family relationship with the author, he has a deep connection with the local people and has his own efforts. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, he was ordered by the Department of Agriculture and Mining to investigate mineral products. After several months of trekking, he was able to return to the province to report. In January of this year (1933), he was again ordered by the Fudian New Bank to negotiate mineral products and announce the government's kindness. It took several months to complete his mission. The author believes that the territory governed by the five kings is important and the situation is special, but the country is still unaware of the situation there. Therefore, while investigating and negotiating mineral affairs, he also conducted general inspections in the general situation, hoping to contribute what he gained to society, to solve the mystery of the Chinese people, and to help develop the border areas. However, the author has shallow academic knowledge and has not conducted thorough investigations, so he is bound to be guilty of hanging one and missing ten. I hope that those who know will teach me.</p>
<h3 id="e96">1. Natural Conditions <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>A. People (1) Population: There are approximately one million people. Because the area is close to the tropics, the climate is mild, and the products are abundant, the population is multiplying rapidly. For example, the weather is better and the products are more abundant in King Shao Xin's territory (i.e., Shao Xing), and the population increase is greater than in the territories of other kings, about 500,000. King Ban Hong's territory has about 300,000. Others, such as the three indigenous territories of Ban Lao, Yong Ban (i.e., Yong Bang), and Kuang Bie, each have 50,000 to 60,000 people. They all live scattered in the mountains, living a life of semi-agriculture and semi-hunting. (2) Ethnicity: The people of the area are the descendants of the San Miao, Jiu Li, Jing Man, and Nan Man in ancient times, and are also one of the Mongolian races. The Pu Man people of the Miao ethnic group are divided into all territories and are named Kawa. They have square faces, long necks, yellow-brown skin, and are simple in nature, truly possessing the air of ancient barbaric peoples, the same as the lives of the primitive people described in history. (3) Nature: The nature of the people is straightforward, simple, stubborn, and dull, and progress is very slow. Moreover, because they like hunting, they have developed a cruel nature. No one dares to associate with them, and an extremely large gap has been drawn between them and the Han people, reducing the opportunity for civilization.</p>
<p>B. Land (1) Location: It is located on the southwestern border of the province, bordering Shuangjiang to the east, Lancang and Menglian to the south, Gengma and Mengding to the north, and British Burma to the west. It is located in the center of travel between China and Burma, and is truly an important town in Yunnan. (2) Area: The area is approximately thousands of square miles, extending a thousand miles east-west and more than seven hundred miles north-south, accounting for almost one-sixth of Yunnan. Shao Xin has about 5,000 square miles, Ban Hong has about 2,000 square miles, Kuang Bie has 2,000 square miles, and Ban Lao and Yong Ban each have more than 1,000 square miles. (3) Terrain: Gongming Mountain connects to the remaining force of the Nushan Mountains, dominating the center, reaching a height of approximately 7,000 meters. Branches divide into five lines, mutually connected and surrounding the Black Mountain in the eastern part of Shao Xin. The Black Mountain branches westward, stretching more than seven hundred miles, directly entering Jinchangba, connecting to the mountains rich in gold and silver minerals. The northern branch of the mountains runs northward, connecting to the Sanjianshan of Gengma. The entire territory forms a large plateau. The mountain terrain is rugged, extending for thousands of miles. To the east of Gongming Mountain are the Nanka River and the Nanlei River, which flow into Burma. The water is turbulent and inconvenient for boats. To the west is the Salween River, which also flows into Burma. To the north are the Nanding River and the Gunlong River, which flow into the Salween River. The water is turbulent and the terrain is dangerous.</p>
<p>C. Climate: The area is located within 13 degrees north latitude and has entered the tropics. However, because the mountains extend horizontally, towering into the clouds, and the terrain is uneven, it has both cold, warm, and hot climates. In the plains and deep valleys, the terrain is low, the climate is hot, and there is also a lot of humidity. The miasma is particularly severe. The mountainous areas have a mild air, much like a temperate zone. As for the high mountains, they are often covered with snow and are very cold. As for storms and mists, they often occur due to the terrain.</p>
<p>D. Transportation: Because of the towering mountains that extend horizontally and the dense forests that block the sun, and also because there is little contact with outsiders, there is no way to talk about road construction. Therefore, the roads are rugged and winding like sheep intestines, making it difficult for people and horses to pass through, and transportation is very difficult. Although there are many rivers, because the terrain is uneven and the water flows rapidly, they are inconvenient for navigation and can only be used by the local people for fishing.</p>
<p>E. Minerals: (1) Metallic minerals: The area's metallic minerals are particularly abundant, with the best quality. It is as if every mountain has them and every place has them. It can be considered the best gold and silver area in the country. It is described in detail below. (Silver mine) The silver mine is produced west of the Black Mountain and under the Great Tip Mountain, at the junction of the three kings of Ban Hong, Ban Lao, and Yong Ban. The mining area is more than a hundred miles north-south and seventy or eighty miles east-west. The mineral veins are accumulated, and the mountains are all covered. Every year, erosion caused by wind and rain flows into the streams. If a mountain valley collapses and mineral rocks appear, it is truly inexhaustible. The quality of the ore is very good. In the old days, the British stole it for analysis, and they also said that the quality of the ore was very good. It is a pity that such abundant mineral veins and good quality ore are abandoned on the ground. (Gold mine) The gold mine is produced between King Shao Xin and the Black Mountain. There is a river in the mountains, containing a lot of gold sand, flowing directly into Jinchangba. The river is also named Jinsha River because it produces gold sand. Every year, the prince allows the people to pan for gold sand for three days, which can cover half a year's expenses. The abundance of gold mines can also be imagined. Other minerals such as copper, iron, antimony, tin, and nickel are found everywhere and are common throughout the area. It is truly an area rich in gold, silver, and treasures. Unfortunately, the government has not paid attention to development and cannot make the best use of its land. (2) Non-metallic minerals: In addition to the abundant metallic minerals, Ban Hong also has particularly abundant non-metallic minerals. For example, the coal mine is produced west of Jinchangba, and the mining area stretches for hundreds of miles. The local people have a lot of firewood and grass, so they have not yet used it. There are also particularly many other raw materials of various kinds. As for gemstones, they are colorful, dazzling, and even unseen by people in the interior.</p>
<p>F. Animals: Because Ban Hong is close to the tropics and has a mild climate, all kinds of animals are particularly strong compared to the interior. Both domestic and wild animals are tall and fat. Domestic and wild animals are described separately below. (1) Domestic animals: Because people live a life of semi-agriculture and semi-pastoralism, they also raise many domestic animals. They are divided into two types according to their nature: 1. Those who live with people: there are chickens, dogs, and pigs. Chickens account for 7 percent, dogs account for 1 percent, and pigs account for 6 percent. They are directly raised by people with wheat, dry rice, corn, etc., and kept in the house. 2. Those who do not live with people: there are yellow cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, horses, mules, and donkeys. Yellow cattle are the most numerous, accounting for 25 percent of the total. Water buffalo account for 8 percent, goats account for 20 percent, sheep account for 10 percent, horses account for 10 percent, mules account for 10 percent, and donkeys account for 10 percent. Although the above animals are domestic animals, they are similar to wild animals, eating and sleeping in the mountains day and night, no different from wild beasts. When people want to use them, they hunt them like wild beasts. (2) Wild animals: The various wild animals are also tropical products, such as elephants, tigers, leopards, bears, deer, muntjac, wild donkeys, wild cattle, wild boars, etc. Elephants are produced in both Ban Hong and Yong Ban, totaling more than 20. Tigers, leopards, bears, etc., often appear day and night along the riverbanks. As for deer, muntjac, wild cattle, and wild boars, they are found everywhere, and people hunt them for food. There are also birds such as peacocks, pheasants, parrots, and mandarin ducks, with beautiful feathers and bright colors, strange and varied, and many kinds.</p>
<p>G. Plants: (1) Trees: The plants in the area are mostly tropical products, different from those in the interior. The trees in the deep mountains are more than ten feet in circumference and several dozen feet in height. There are countless such large trees everywhere on the mountains. The types are complex and difficult to enumerate. Among them, the most famous are the Lei tree, Jiujiang, Zibai, Na Lei Lei, Zhuang, Zhao, etc., which grow the fastest, growing one foot per year and one foot wide. In the deep valleys, there are also large bean trees and crow pillow trees, which are also particularly tall. The local people take their fruits as food. The shell is like a box, which can hold things and be used as children's toys. (2) Fruit trees: The most notable fruit trees are loquats, grapes, sesame plum fruits, yellow fruits, bananas, etc., which taste extremely sweet, fragrant, and delicious, but they are all wild and rarely cultivated. There are no other peaches, plums, apricots, etc. (3) Flowers and grasses: Strange flowers and exotic herbs are found everywhere in the area. The flowers are mostly beautiful and large, and there are many kinds. Those who see them are amazed. There are even fresh flowers that do not wither all year round, which are even rarer in the interior. There are many kinds of grasses, too numerous to mention. The most famous are the three kinds: fragrant grass, Zhanjian grass, and large batch grass, which are extremely lush. The stems are as large as cups, and the leaves are juicy, making it easy to fatten livestock when used to feed them. (4) Grains: The main grains are dry rice and corn, followed by wheat and millet. Planting here is simple and harvests are abundant. Every year in February, trees are cut down and burned after they are dry, and then planted, sprouting immediately without weeding. By May or June, a good harvest can be obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e97">2. Economic Conditions <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>A. Agriculture: The climate is mild and the soil is fertile in the Huluwang area, making agriculture easy. However, because people live a semi-nomadic life, they focus on livestock and hunting, and planting is only a subordinate activity. Livestock and hunting are the main activities. The local agricultural conditions are described below. (1) Planting: Due to the climate and geography, planting with simple cultivation can yield a good harvest. The main crops are dry rice, corn, millet, and wheat. The planting method is to first cut down trees and dense weeds in January each year, expose them to the sun, and then burn them with fire. With a little manual labor, the soil is loosened, and the seeds are sown on them in March. Without weeding, it is possible to obtain a bumper harvest from July to August. Planting by one person can easily provide for several people. Therefore, most local people do not take planting as their main occupation. Annual agricultural products can only meet needs, with little surplus. Moreover, the people are under the oppression of the various kings, and the taxes are very heavy. The surplus of planting is all collected. Also, whenever planting is done, the people must gather to finish the planting of the prince before they can plant their own. Therefore, the general people do not have time to cultivate and are unwilling to do much planting. Therefore, although they are located in places with good climate and soil, farming is declining. (2) Animal husbandry: The climate is hot and the trees and grasses are flourishing, and because the mountains are horizontal and the forests are dense, animal husbandry is particularly developed. Both cattle, sheep, horses, donkeys, mules, etc., are produced in large quantities. The people use them as their main food, and many are also exported. However, the livestock in a certain king's territory are exclusively owned by the king, and no one else can enter the territory to hunt them. Even what his people eat is bestowed by the king. The people cannot own them privately. Livestock in all regions often live and reproduce in the mountains, similar to wild animals. This is truly using the earth as a large pasture. (3) Hunting: In addition to planting and animal husbandry, the main occupation of the people is hunting. When work is completed, whether men or women, they take knives, guns, nets, and spears to hunt birds and beasts in the mountains or fish by the water. From the prince to the people, everyone likes to engage in this activity, so they have developed a cruel nature.</p>
<p>B. Industry: The people in the area still live in the primitive age. Also, because animals are abundant and clothing, food, and housing are easily resolved, there is no need to seek other ways of making a living, and industry is naturally out of the question. The only industries now are extremely simple handicrafts, such as weaving hemp and bamboo. Among them, the only notable industry is a kind of hemp fabric called Kawa Bei Lei, which is six feet long and three feet wide. The construction is very simple. The local people wear it on their bodies as clothing. As for the various tools they use, they are all purchased from the Han people in the border areas. Their industry is still stagnating in the primitive state.</p>
<p>C. Commerce: Because transportation is not available and the customs are barbaric, outsiders mostly do not dare to go deep into the area, only trading in the border areas. Commerce in the area is very sparse. The various situations are described below. 1. External trade: Every year, there are two seasons, in March and October. The people go out to the Tusi lands of Gengma, Mengjiao Dong, Mengdian, and the British Burmese border area of Maliba, and trade with Han people, Hui people, Burmese, Baiyi Bennong, etc. The main exports are opium, Zigeng, etc. They mostly do not use weighing scales, but estimate with the eye, which is very simple. They are very trustworthy when trading with people. If they order goods from people, they use wood carvings as proof. Even after several years, if they meet again, the ordered goods, no matter how decayed, are still preserved. This is truly "keeping one's word." The intermediaries in foreign trade are mostly currencies, including French silver dollars, British silver dollars, and Chinese silver dollars. In recent years, the various kings have absorbed a lot of silver coins, but they are rarely used, so they are mostly buried underground. 2. Internal trade: Because Han people mostly do not dare to go deep into the area, only pure local people enter the area to trade. Also, because there are no markets, trading can take place anywhere between villages. By means of bartering, they exchange salt, tea, oil, sugar, cloth fabrics, grass fabrics, iron and copper utensils, etc., for the opium, Zigeng, and livestock they produce. Internal trade is mostly done by women, who are very trustworthy and fair. The procedures are also very simple, completely a primitive social life, an era of bartering.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Three Aspects of Life <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>一. Language: Within the territory, the people are of pure ethnicity, with very few people of different ethnicities intermingling. Therefore, the language is still relatively unified. Although there are slight differences, they are only the differences between "cooked barbarian language" (熟蕃語) and "raw barbarian language" (生蕃語). Below is a comparison of how they pronounce numbers:</p>
<p>Chinese: (一) (二) (三) (四) (五) (六) (七) (八) (九) (十)</p>
<p>Cooked Barbarian Language: Di, La, Lü, Peng, Bing, Nai, Qiao, Dai, Dian, Gao</p>
<p>Raw Barbarian Language: Ti, La, Li, Ben, Mian, Leng, Ye, Tai, Tian, Ke</p>
<p>Judging from the above, the two types of barbarian language, cooked and raw, are quite similar. The distinction between clear and muddy sounds is not very significant. The language commonly used within the territory and for communication with outsiders is mainly the cooked barbarian language. If outsiders wish to enter the territory, they must learn this language, or they cannot enter. Furthermore, because there is no written script, it is difficult for outsiders to learn. This is also a major reason for the lack of progress.</p>
<p>B. Customs: (1) Marriage: There is no strict distinction in bloodlines. Except for direct siblings, marital relations are not allowed. However, cousins within the family can freely marry anyone. Regardless of gender, when they reach the age of 17 or 18, they dance and sing together. If they are compatible, they engage in physical relations. Therefore, it is very common for children to be born before they become formally married. After engaging in physical relations, if the man and woman are fond of each other and reluctant to part, the man will first hide the woman elsewhere before asking a companion (i.e., a matchmaker from inland China) to explain the situation to the woman's family. If permission is granted, they first gather together and have tea as an engagement ceremony. Only after having children do they formally marry, with a meat-eating feast as the ceremony. At the wedding, guests from both the bride and groom's families bring one or two taels of meat as gifts. Everyone sits around and eats the meat they brought before stopping. In this way, they become a formal couple. This is truly free-love marriage. (2) Funerals: Funeral ceremonies are very simple. When someone dies, it is believed to be because Heaven cannot tolerate them, and others are afraid of being implicated. The deceased is buried immediately and not left for a long time. After a person dies, they are wrapped in a bamboo curtain and buried in the ground. There are no other procedures or sacrificial rites. (3) Social Interaction: People mostly use wooden carvings as proof of agreements. Whether buying and selling land or engaging in other transactions, wooden carvings are used instead of contracts. For example, if Person A buys land from Person B, a piece of wood is carved with patterns and shapes of birds and beasts, about five inches long. It is split in half; the seller burns half publicly to permanently cut off ties, and the buyer keeps the other half as a contract. This method is also used for transactions; each party keeps half as proof. When they meet later, they can recognize each other. Therefore, all kinds of social interactions rely on this as evidence, gradually becoming a custom.</p>
<p>C. Religion: (1) Animism: The territory has towering terrain and dense forests. The people live by farming and hunting; hence, they mostly worship mountains, rivers, trees, and forests. Each village has a large forest of trees called "Dragon Trees." The natives are not allowed to take anything from the Dragon Trees. If they accidentally take something and become ill, they believe it is because the Dragon Trees are causing trouble. Every year, during the spring and autumn seasons, on the day of the Tiger in the lunar calendar, they slaughter cattle or sheep as a sacrifice. For five days from the day of the sacrifice, no one is allowed to pass through the Dragon Bridge, to show avoidance and prevent offending the gods. (2) Ghost Worship: Ghost worship is also known as "Doing Ghosts." When people become ill, they believe it is because ghosts are causing trouble. They invite about ten people who can "Do Ghosts" to the riverbank or roadside, where they kneel on the ground on behalf of the sick person. Everyone chants incantations, scatters rice in all directions, says words of telling the ghosts what they want, and sacrifices a cow and a sheep as offerings. (3) Offering to the Harvest: Every year during the spring and autumn seasons, when planting and harvesting grains, people send others out to capture the heads of Han Chinese and Bai Yi people to sacrifice to the harvest. The more heads, the better, especially those with long beards and hair. If it is difficult to capture outsiders, wild indigenous people also come to the border to capture pure indigenous people as sacrifices. Therefore, few people interact with them during the spring and autumn seasons. During the sacrifice, the heads are impaled on long poles and planted in the dry-land grain fields. The nearby people are summoned, and each person brings tea, rice, silver, etc., to offer as a sacrifice. Everyone kneels and cries, stuffing the things they brought into the mouths of the heads, crying and saying, "You came to our place to find money and rice, but you were killed to sacrifice to the dry-land grain. You cannot eat or see your parents, wife, and friends, so we give you more money and rice to eat. We hope you ascend to heaven and bless our dry-land grain to have a bumper harvest." After the sacrifice, the heads are taken to other places for sacrifice. If other places also kill heads and bring them back, they are left for wild animals to eat, to signify that the heads have ascended to heaven, and it is hoped that the dry-land grain will have a bumper harvest. This cruel sacrifice has become an unchangeable custom. (4) Other: Recently, in some areas near Burma, temples have been built, and Buddhism is revered, which has a certain impact on local culture. In recent years, British missionaries have been sent to the border areas to learn the local language and deeply propagate their faith. Some people also worship them. This is something that deserves close attention.</p>
<p>D. Education: The people in this territory are savage and do not know what education is. Only a few young masters and princes from the aristocratic families within the territory of Ban Hong Wang request monks from the border areas to teach them a few scriptures.</p>
<p>E. Lifestyle: (1) Clothing: Clothing is mostly made of rough and simple cloth woven from cotton or hemp. Only pure indigenous people sew them into clothing to cover their bodies. As for the wild indigenous people, they are mostly naked, with their bodies painted black. Regardless of gender, they only use one or two chi [unit of measurement] to cover their genitals, which is extremely unsightly and no different from beasts. (2) Diet: Food is mostly eaten raw. Although pure indigenous people have recently learned to cook slightly, they only casually heat it through. As for the wild indigenous people, they do not know how to cook. They eat raw rice and raw meat, rarely cooking it before eating. What is even stranger is that meat must be left until it has a rancid smell to be considered delicious and fragrant. The main foods are dry-land grain, corn, millet, ginger, and chili peppers. They are particularly fond of tea and wine. Regardless of wealth, they drink tea five or six times a day, several bowls each time. They are addicted to alcohol as if it were their life. They often form groups and go to the lands of Gengma, Mengjiao, Dong, and other local leaders to trade for wine and food. They can be seen drunk and lying on the ground everywhere. As for drinking raw sheep and raw cow blood, or splashing blood on rice and eating it, it makes people want to vomit. Their bodies are healthy, and their resistance is strong, perhaps due to their lifestyle. (3) Housing: Because the climate is hot, they cannot live on flat land. Houses are mostly built on high mountains, and the style is extremely simple. They are all thatched huts. Those built in the style of pavilions are commonly called "Zhan Lou". Those built on the ground are called "thatched sheds". If the roof has two planks protruding one chi long, it indicates that it is their royal residence. Other common people cannot imitate this. Houses are scattered all over the mountains, rarely clustered together. (4) Sleep: Regardless of princes or commoners, they set up a fireplace in the middle of the house. At night, they sleep together without any separation. Parents, brothers, sisters, wives, all huddle around the fireplace and sleep together. Therefore, there are many cases of murder and incest in the territory.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Four Political Conditions <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>A. Social Organization: Although the people in the territory are still in a nomadic stage, without capitalists or landlords, there is already a class division between nobles and commoners. The rulers are the oppressing class. People of all classes must absolutely obey the ruling class; otherwise, the upper class has the power to execute them. The social organization is illustrated below:</p>
<p>Great Prince - Each Prince - Each Grain Leader</p>
<p>Each Head of Household - Each Centurion - Each</p>
<p>Manager - People</p>
<p>From this, we can see the large number of classes and the heavy oppression suffered by the people. Whenever people encounter members of the upper class, they must perform the kowtow ceremony. The strictness of the upper class is imaginable.</p>
<p>B. Political Implementation: (1) Political Power: Political power is held in the hands of the various princes. Within their respective territories, matters of finance, military preparations, trials, punishments, rewards, issuing orders, etc., are not to be interfered with by others and are entirely in the hands of the princes. Moreover, the princes are hereditary, and the people are slaves for generations. As for the relationship between each prince and the Overall Prince (i.e., the Shaoxing Prince), other than paying tribute once every three years, there is nothing else. (2) Political Decrees: Because there is no written script, when princes want to implement political decrees within the territory, and when people want to report matters, they rely on wooden carvings as proof. Regardless of rest, as long as there is an order from a superior or when encountering a superior leader, they must perform the most respectful kowtow ceremony. When there is an emergency in the territory that requires summoning all the people, they blow a cow horn as the command to gather the people. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Sun Did Not Accept Advice from Pang Bingxun and Others <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Jin-Sui Army Has Received 300,000 Yuan in Departure Funds</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the disposition of Sun Dianying's troops, since Military Commission members Pang Bingxun, Ji Yiqiao, and Hu Yukun sent a final telegram to Sun with advice, no reply has been received from Sun as of tonight (the 20th). It is generally speculated that the effectiveness of the advice telegram will be extremely limited, so a peaceful resolution will ultimately become a pipe dream. Observing Sun's troops' recent active attacks on Pingluo, it is clear that Sun has no sincerity for peace. Furthermore, since Sun sent Jin Zunhua to Beiping, he has repeatedly convened meetings of officers above the rank of regimental commander at Fangci to discuss future prospects. His direct-line officers generally advocated that Sun not leave hastily, expressing a willingness to share hardships. Sun originally did not want to leave the army and now uses the excuse that his subordinates have expressed this sentiment, making it even more difficult to accept the advice of Pang and others. Therefore, Pang and others are keeping the original telegram strictly confidential, not wanting to disclose it to the outside world to avoid seeking embarrassment. Jin Zunhua, who came to Beiping in response to He Yingqin's telegram summons, has no choice but to wait for Sun's reply to determine his next course of action, given that Beiping has already sent an advisory telegram. However, he plans to stay in Beiping for the time being.</p>
<p>Ningsia Chairman Ma Hongkui sent a telegram to Beiping today, forwarded by Deng Baoshan in Gansu. The general idea was to inquire about the situation of the Jin-Sui Army and urge Xu Fu and others to quickly advance their troops to relieve the siege of Ningsia Province. Currently, Sun's troops around Pingluo are concentrating their forces to fiercely attack. The various forts outside Ningsia City are still occupied by Sun's troops. Ma Baolin's troops inside the city are putting up a valiant resistance. There have been daily contacts near Ningsia's new city. Sun Dianying himself is traveling back and forth to command in the vicinity of the Great and Small Mosques and has established a puppet provincial government in Shizuizi, replacing the magistrates and tax bureau and public security bureau chiefs of Dengkou and Pingluo counties. It is said that Sun is preparing to flee to eastern Gansu and join forces with Xu bandits in northern Sichuan when the Jin-Sui Army moves out.</p>
<p>The Jin-Sui Army units that have been dispatched, Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry and the two brigades of Tian Shumei and Wang Deying under Wang Jingguo's command, have all arrived in Linhe. Follow-up units such as Wang Shu'an's cavalry division are also preparing to move out. Zhao Chengzhou himself arrived in Suiyuan today (the 20th), will stay briefly, and then go to Baotou and transfer to Linhe to arrange everything. Wang Shu'an is also going to Suiyuan to meet with Wang Jingguo. The Dong and Zhang brigades of Fu Zuoyi's troops will also successively move west starting today. The infantry and artillery are transported by car after passing Baotou, which is extremely short of cars, so the advance is inevitably slower. It is said that the Military Commission will allocate a number of military transport vehicles to facilitate military transport. The General Directorate of Military Stations will be established in Baotou in the future. All the Jin-Sui troops departing will temporarily gather in Linhe, awaiting orders to advance west.</p>
<p>The Gan-Ning armies plan to encircle Sun's troops. Ningxia and Pingluo will continue to be defended by the troops of Ma Hongbin and Ma Hongkui. After the Jin-Sui Army completes its deployment, they will launch an attack. A unit of Ma Bufang's division has arrived at Honggangshan, planning to outflank Sun's army. The Gan-Ning border defense is extremely solid, with a force of 30,000 troops at Zhongwei.</p>
<p>Xu Yongchang and Fu Zuoyi have been in Beiping for several days, discussing military expenses with He Yingqin. A result has been reached. He has agreed to allocate approximately 300,000 yuan for the first month's military expenses and rations for the 41st Army to the Jin-Sui Army. Yesterday, 50,000 yuan in cash was received from the Military Commission and remitted to the principal. Fu Zuoyi will be able to set off in one or two days after the cost of establishing the supply station is calculated. Fu hosted a banquet for the members of the Military Commission at his private residence this afternoon. The above issues were further discussed after the banquet. Furthermore, it is reported that after the central government sent Zhang Tingmeng and others to drive the Air Administration's 401 and 402 aircraft to Lanzhou, Zhu Shaoliang immediately sent them to work in the Ningsia provincial capital. On the 10th of this month, the two aircraft carried a large number of leaflets entitled "A Loyal Admonition to the Soldiers of the 15th Route Army, 35th Division, 9th Division, and 2nd Cavalry Division of Qinghai and Ningsia Provinces to the Entire 41st Army" and flew to Sun's troops' positions on the outskirts of the city to scatter them, urging them to quickly come to their senses. After scattering them, they flew back to Lanzhou. Due to weather conditions, they have not continued to fly there in recent days (the 20th).</p>
<h3 id="e101">Gubeikou Will Be Taken Over <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Date Has Been Set for the 28th</p>
<p>Japanese Troops and Puppet Organizations Will Withdraw Slowly</p>
<p>We Will Only Take Over Administrative Power</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: It has been over eight months since Gubeikou fell. Through the recent efforts of Huang Fu, Yin Rugeng, and others to negotiate with the Japanese, it has been decided to take over on the 28th. Looking at the negotiation process, since last November, Yin once went to Gubeikou to negotiate with Japanese representatives. At that time, it was rumored that the takeover could be expected by the end of the year, but it was delayed because the details of the takeover could not be finalized. Recently, after Yuguan decided to take over, the Japanese also urged us to proceed with the takeover negotiations for Gubeikou as soon as possible. Yin was ordered to come to Beiping and first asked the Zhenzheng Hui Huang Fu for instructions, then went to Tianjin to conduct a concrete study with the Hebei Provincial Government. The takeover plan and details were completely determined. He then returned to Beiping from Tianjin and had detailed discussions with Japanese Embassy military attaché Shibayama. A few days ago, Shibayama telegraphed Matsui, the acting head of the Japanese Special Agency stationed in Chengde, to set a date to conduct takeover procedures with our representatives. Matsui telegraphed back from Changchun, saying that he could arrive in Gubeikou on the 24th or 25th, and requested Yin Rugeng and others to go there for negotiations. To save procedures, Yin asked Shibayama yesterday (the 19th) to telegraph Matsui, asking him to handle the handover matters together. The Japanese have already agreed to most of the details, so there should be no problems. Therefore, Yin is currently preparing for the takeover procedures and has set the 25th to go to Gubeikou with the takeover personnel to have a discussion with Matsui. On the 26th and 27th, both parties will prepare the procedures. On the 28th, the official takeover will take place. The handover ceremony will be the same as the takeover of Shanhaiguan. In addition to Yin Rugeng, the takeover personnel include the director of the Zuo Zhi Bureau, the director of the Gubeikou Office of the Jiji Administrative Commissioner's Office, and the director of the Gubeikou Public Security Bureau. The provincial government has appointed Liu Youdong and Huo Shi as the director of the Gubeikou Zuo Zhi Bureau and the director of the office. The candidate for the director of the Public Security Bureau has not been determined and will be announced soon. Matsui will supervise the handover by the Japanese. Yesterday, Yin sent personnel to Gubeikou to make preparations. This afternoon, Yin left Beiping and returned to his residence in Tongzhou to handle everything. This time, the administrative power of Gubeikou will be taken over first. Military and political power will have to wait a bit. The Japanese troops in Gubeikou are using the excuse that there are no barracks outside the port and will not withdraw for the time being. They must wait until the barracks are repaired before they can be transferred. All the puppet organizations will not be moved and withdrawn for a while and will temporarily be mixed with our organizations. The Japanese also requested restrictions on the number of police and security teams stationed in Gubeikou and the number of guns, intending that it should not exceed 500 people. Police officers on duty must not carry guns. Our side still disagrees with this point and must negotiate again during the takeover. As for the establishment of customs, which concerns finance, personnel will be sent by the Ministry of Finance to carry out the work after the takeover. The various ports of Malan峪 are also preparing to be taken over (February 20).</p>

<h3 id="e102">Provincial Order Designates Clearance Measurement to Be Handled <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Last year, the Provincial Land Bureau commissioned a triangular root point team to come to Songjiang to survey the location and set up markers to measure the triangulation points for future clearance measurement. Now, the county government has received instructions from the provincial government that the Land Bureau intends to implement the administrative guidelines for the second half of the 22nd year, planning to start clearance measurement in nine counties, including Changshu, Songjiang, and Shanghai, because the measurement by the root point team in each county is sufficient for clearance measurement, and the funds for clearance measurement are assessed with a certain percentage, which is sufficient for clearance measurement. The four counties, including Songjiang, will be launched immediately. They are instructed to make proper contacts when the clearance measurement team arrives and protect them at any time. County Magistrate Jin has instructed all district chiefs to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Discussion on Dredging Changshan River <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Changshan River connects various ports such as Zhu Jing and Songyin in Jinshan County to the south. The river course is tortuous, with a bend every three li. The river is gradually silting up and cannot be navigated. The rice industry in the Xitan area of this city is greatly affected. The sale of agricultural products along the river is also inconvenient. Various sectors have been planning to expand the dredging, but it has not been held. Now, during the dredging of the city river, County Magistrate Jin invited Cai Zhongyu, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Zhang Jiliang, the leader of the rice industry, to discuss dredging. The cost of dredging the river is approximately 6,000 yuan. The Xitan rice market has an annual business of approximately 300,000 dan. Assessing a dredging donation of two cents per dan will generate enough revenue in one year to cover the dredging costs. Both the rice industry and farmers will benefit. It is reported that Zhang Jiliang said that he will report back after convening a meeting of the Rice Industry Association.</p>

<p>The Ju Xing Chicken and Goose Shop outside the gate previously applied to the Wuxian Animal Tax Collection Office and was approved to pay an annual tax of 800 yuan and a handling fee of 200 yuan to obtain exclusive operating rights in the entire county. Wang Xiangbao and others also opened the He Xing Chicken and Goose Shop and also obtained a short-term operating permit from the tax office. Therefore, Ju Xing believed that Director Jiang of the tax office was interfering with their business and negotiated with the office but to no avail. They photographed the evidence and, in addition to filing a lawsuit with the local court, demanding compensation for business losses, appealed to the Ministry of Finance. Citizens Wang Ligeng and others also submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, accusing Director Jiang of malfeasance and fraud, requesting his dismissal to warn officials.</p>

<p>The director of the preparatory office of the County Land Bureau was previously concurrently held by the county magistrate to handle land affairs. Recently, the Provincial Land Bureau, in order to rectify the land throughout the province, specially appointed Fu Shengen to come to Wuxi to serve as the director of the preparatory office of the Land Bureau. It has been over a month since he took over. In order to understand the actual situation of the Qing Wen Tu Gen (clean document and chart root) work, Fu decided to go to the countryside on the 23rd of this month to conduct on-site investigations in order to clarify the situation. The current Tu Gen team's group headquarters is stationed in Tangtou Town in the sixth district, divided into three teams to separately measure the scenery and root points. The clearance measurement teams are stationed behind the Railway Hotel, also divided into two groups, the first group in Zhouxin Town and the second group in Nanqiao, to carry out clearance measurement work. It is also reported that five counties, including Zhenjiang, Jiading, Qingpu, Danyang, and Fengxian, have already established Land Bureaus to handle land tax registration. The remaining counties, including Wuxi, Wuxian, and Wujin, are still in preparation and are expected to be formally established and begin registration in about three months.</p>

<p>On the 19th, the county government convened the Rural Improvement Committee. All agreed that rescuing the rural economy was a crucial and effective method. Based on the situation in the county, each township should form cotton production and sales cooperatives in groups, and the entire county should establish a joint association of cotton production and sales cooperatives to concentrate the talents and strength of the entire county. The Farmers Bank should provide economic assistance in order to avoid empty talk. The following resolutions were made: (1) Each county district will separately convene rural leaders to organize cotton production and sales cooperatives. (2) Before the establishment of the joint association, the county government will hire various members of the party department, district chiefs, education directors, managers of the Farmers Bank, cooperative instructors, and one enthusiastic social worker from each district to form a design committee to plan detailed implementation methods. (3) The action plan includes promoting the use of millions of Huamian cotton varieties to gradually eliminate local cotton varieties, improving cotton planting methods to develop production quantities, dividing cotton into grades to meet market needs, eliminating the malpractices of selling cotton in order to consolidate sales credit, jointly transporting and selling to increase the income of members, jointly utilizing various equipment such as cotton ginning plants, packing plants, and warehouses required for production and sales operations, jointly borrowing the necessary funds for production and sales, and hiring specialized personnel to provide technical guidance.

<p>According to a survey conducted in Huaiyin City at the end of the old lunar year, of the money shops, Xiangtai, Fukang, Qingsheng, Zhengtai, Desheng, and Fukang made a profit, with the highest interest rate being 5,000 yuan and the lowest being 1,000 yuan. However, Shengda and Dehou went bankrupt due to losses, and Yutai closed down due to sluggish business. The reason for this is that it is difficult to use money in Zhenjiang, and the China Communications and Shanghai banks in Pu hold remittance funds, which hinders the development of the industry. The silk and cloth industry suffered losses and sold goods at reduced prices due to the large number of goods imported last spring and the low prices in the summer. For example, Dingda had a total of 400,000 yuan on its books, but the result was only a surplus of 2,000 yuan. The rest can be imagined. Jinyuanfeng closed due to share splits. The rest also had more losses than profits. As for the Beijing and Guangdong grocery industries, they also had no success due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the sharp decline in sales. Among them, Dashengchang, Dayouheng, Hongchangyi, Yufengtai (groceries above) and Chaochang, Sifuzhai, and Hongtaichang (Guangdong goods above) had small profits. The rest were only able to maintain the facade.</p>

He also said that the bureau's administrative affairs were indeed on the right track and expressed further hope for the strict implementation of austerity. However, at the same time, Mr. Pu Subai also notified that Mr. Meyrick had felt unwell since returning to his country from China last winter and suddenly passed away in London on the evening of the 18th of this month (a Wednesday).

<p>Whether it Can Meet the Wishes of the Chinese People</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the election period for the Shanghai Municipal Council is approaching, and the organization of the Council is currently a problem. It is reported that the Standing Committee of the Council will convene a meeting on Wednesday afternoon to consider this matter. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association recently sent a letter to the Municipal Council, requesting an increase in the number of Chinese councilors. The current number is five, and at least four more need to be added, for a total of nine. The number of foreign councilors is also currently nine. This movement began when there were three Chinese councilors, and after it was increased to five, it continued to develop, leading to this request. According to sources on the Chinese side, this request is not based on the amount of taxes paid by the Chinese but on the original request made five years ago when discussing the issue of Chinese councilors. An official from the Chinese Ratepayers' Association stated yesterday that even if the number is increased to nine, considering the tax figures, it is still far from the number that should be. Three years ago, foreigners accounted for 45% of the taxes collected in the International Settlement, with the rest coming from the Chinese. At that time, the ratio of foreign to Chinese councilors was 9 to 5. According to statistics, the taxes paid by the Chinese have now increased to 64% of the total, while foreigners account for only 36%. If allocated according to this ratio, there should be 16 Chinese councilors. However, they do not want to demand too much at present, and in this transitional era, they would be satisfied with an increase of four.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Unified Method for Business Firms' Account Booking and Telegraphing, Submitted to the Ministry <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Interest Paid by the Postal Savings Bank</p>
<p>To be Implemented from March 1st</p>
<p>In order to facilitate business firms in sending telegrams, the Ministry of Communications has specially formulated a method for guaranteeing account booking and telegraphing, and now instructs all subordinates to implement it from March 1st. The gist of the instruction is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Instruction from the Ministry of Communications <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications instructs various Telegraph Administration Bureaus, Shanghai and Tianjin Telegraph Bureaus, and various Radio Stations, stating that the various bureaus and stations have no uniform method for handling the prepaid telegraph fees of business firms. Some responsible personnel, including those in charge of accounting, have even concealed prepaid telegraph fees of business firms without reporting them, or have privately misappropriated or embezzled interest. The Ministry has specially formulated a method for guaranteeing account booking and telegraphing for the convenience of merchants and the public and for ease of audit. It is hereby copied and issued for compliance and for instructing the various subordinate bureaus to comply. Hereafter, when the various bureaus and stations receive telegraph fee deposits from business firms, in addition to strictly complying with the provisions of the three articles of this method, they should list them in a monthly register and submit a list for verification. Furthermore, the telegraph fee auditors of the various bureaus and stations should also closely audit the aforementioned guarantee deposits at any time. If there is any unauthorized misappropriation or deduction of interest, it should be secretly reported for thorough investigation. This order is for instruction.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Account Booking Method <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The original text of the newly formulated method for guaranteeing account booking and telegraphing is as follows: (1) For the convenience of sending telegrams, various business firms may request the telegraph bureau or radio station to send account booking telegrams in accordance with the provisions of this method. (2) Any business firm applying to send account booking telegrams should deposit a sum of money in cash with the bureau or station in advance, according to the estimated amount of telegraph fees for each month, as a guarantee deposit for telegraph fees (hereinafter referred to as guarantee deposit). The amount shall not be less than 100 yuan. (3) When the bureau or station receives the guarantee deposit paid by the business firm, it shall issue a receipt as proof. This guarantee deposit shall be deposited into a bank by the bureau or station in separate accounts and shall not be withdrawn except in the following three circumstances: A. When the business firm fails to pay telegraph fees owed, and the bureau or station withdraws the funds to offset them. B. When the business firm stops sending telegrams, and the bureau or station withdraws the funds for refund. C. When the business firm reduces the number of telegrams sent, and the bureau or station withdraws a portion of the guarantee deposit for refund. (4) The interest on the guarantee deposit shall be paid to the business firm by the bureau or station when the bank settles accounts every six months. (5) The bureau or station shall issue an account booking telegraph receipt book to the business firm that has paid the guarantee deposit. When sending telegrams, the telegrams shall be sent to the bureau or station by presenting this receipt book. (6) The telegrams sent by the business firm that has paid the guarantee deposit shall be recorded in an account by the bureau or station at any time, and a list of telegraph fees shall be prepared at the end of the month for settlement with the business firm. After receiving the list, the business firm shall pay the full amount within three days, and the bureau or station shall issue a receipt as proof. If the payment is overdue, the bureau or station shall immediately suspend the account booking telegraphing for that account and deduct the telegraph fees from its guarantee deposit, refunding any balance. (7) If the telegraph fees incurred by the business firm that has paid the guarantee deposit exceed the amount of the guarantee deposit during the month, the bureau or station shall notify the business firm to add to the guarantee deposit at any time. If the addition is not made within three days after notification, the bureau or station shall, in addition to suspending the account booking telegraphing for that account, deduct the telegraph fees from the guarantee deposit and recover any remaining amount. (8) If a business firm reduces the number of telegrams sent, it may request the bureau or station to refund a portion of the guarantee deposit. (9) The guarantee deposit specified in Article 2 of this method may be replaced by a guarantee letter from a bank designated by the bureau or station. (10) This method shall be implemented from March 1, 1934.</p>

<p>Guangdong Province needs a lot of oilseed meal and beans every year. After the Northeast was lost, it switched to purchasing Northwest goods from ports such as Haizhou to make up for the deficiency. However, transporting raw kernels from Haizhou to Shanghai and then to Guangdong requires the payment of about 30 cents in customs duties per dan. The Longhai Railway Bureau and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have agreed to expand the old Yao combined transportation route and add a direct old Yao-Guangdong route to carry raw kernels, beans, and other goods to Guangdong. Since water freight is exempt from customs duties and can avoid the export customs duties for transshipment, it is greatly welcomed by the Guangdong merchants. It has now been agreed to dispatch ships soon. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has specially chartered the Yongheng and Shou Kang ships to increase voyages to the old Yao and add new routes to Guangzhou.</p>

<p>There are many combined transportation goods on the Pinghan Railway, especially ginned cotton, tung oil, miscellaneous grains, and mineral sand. The Ministry of Railways has urged the Pinghan Railway Bureau, which has also negotiated with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to hand over the combined transportation goods to the company's Yangtze River ships for loading. All the detailed rules of combined transportation have also been agreed upon. It is planned to implement it on the first of next month. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has sent Zhou Fengtu, Director of Combined Transportation, to Wuhan to sign detailed rules of operation with the Pinghan Railway, and progress is smooth. Zhou left for Wuhan on the 17th and will be able to return to Shanghai soon to prepare for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Foreign Communities Telegraph International Postal Conference <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Accelerate Mail Through Siberia</p>
<p>Postal Authorities Claim No Responsibility</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Shanghai Foreign Communities Association telegraphed the International Postal Conference convened in Cairo this month because the mail from Europe to Shanghai via Siberia was received too late. The wording of the telegram was quite firm, not only expressing the hope that the efforts of the conference would speed up the mail via Siberia, but also requesting that China reduce the postage for foreign mail, which is now 60% to 250% higher than in other countries. In recent months, mail via Siberia has taken four weeks to reach Shanghai, or even more than four weeks, whereas in normal times it takes only about 16 days. According to the postal authorities in this city, this is because the central government does not recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo, so European mail via Siberia has to be rerouted via Vladivostok and then by navy. If there are no ships directly to Shanghai, it must first be sent to Japan and then transferred to Shanghai, which causes delays. The postal authorities cannot be held responsible for this situation and there is no way to remedy it.</p>

<p>Cases Discussed (1) The case of the Daxing Shipping Company's Hongxing steamer colliding with the Lin Lifeng junk at the Wusongkou. It was resolved that the Hongxing side pulled back and retreated to the right, which was not in violation of the port regulations or the location. Based on various circumstances, the fault should be borne by the tugboat. The compensation for damages should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 112 of the Maritime Law. (2) The case of the Tonghua Shipping Company's Tongshang steamer colliding with Liu Longpu's coal boat on the Jiangning section of the Yangtze River near Nanjing, drowning five crew members.

<h3 id="e140">The Peril and Rescue of Weng Wenhao <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>His Injuries Have Significantly Decreased</p>
<p>Regarding Weng Wenhao's ordeal, initial reports from various newspapers stated that he had collided with a long-distance bus, and the details of his rescue were also unclear. Now, a relative of the Weng family who returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday provided a very detailed account of the incident, including information previously unknown to others. We are publishing the following as a supplement:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th of this month, Mr. Chen Bokui, who works at No. 2 Jiujiang Road in Shanghai, Mr. Chen Binggang, who works at the Lixing Foreign Firm on Beijing Road, and Mr. Yu Bingyong, each accompanied by their wives, a total of seven people, chartered a long-distance bus from Beijing to Hangzhou for sightseeing along the way. Near Tai Lake, they saw Mr. Weng sitting alone in a car, which passed them. Around 4 p.m., when Mr. Chen and his party arrived at the scene of the accident, they saw Mr. Weng's car crashed against the side of a bridge. The uninjured driver of his car was kneeling on the ground, shouting for help. Local villagers from Wukang were also shouting for help. At that time, a private car, identified as Beijing 751, which was traveling from Beijing to Hangzhou, happened to be parked nearby. Only one person was in the car. After Mr. Chen and his party got out of their bus, they saw that Mr. Weng and another driver were seriously injured and bleeding profusely. They urgently considered sending the two injured men to Hangzhou for medical treatment by their long-distance bus, but because the long-distance bus would be very bumpy and slow-moving, they feared that the two men would lose too much blood and their lives would be endangered. They discussed with the passenger of car 751, requesting that he give up his car so that the injured could be sent to Hangzhou immediately. Mr. Chen and his party would then invite the passenger to share the long-distance bus with them. Unexpectedly, the passenger completely ignored them and drove away quickly. Mr. Chen and his party, eager to help, immediately carried the two injured men onto the long-distance bus, intending to rush to Hangzhou. At that time, Mr. Weng was still conscious and asked his driver where they were. Upon learning that they were close to Wukang, he said, "Go to Wukang first," and instructed the driver to drive slowly to avoid bumps. When the bus arrived in Wukang, they were initially unfamiliar with the place and did not know where the hospital was. Later, Mr. Chen and his party managed to find the police chief of the local Public Security Bureau and asked him to quickly telegraph Hangzhou to send a doctor to Wukang. When Mr. Weng got out of the bus, a repairman who had boarded at the Moganshan Bus Station volunteered to carry him on his back to the Wukang County Hospital for emergency treatment. After receiving the news, the Hangzhou Guangji Hospital immediately dispatched a doctor to Wukang at 11 p.m. that night. At 5 a.m. the next morning, Mr. Weng was sent to Hangzhou by the city government's ambulance. Reports in Nanjing newspapers claiming that Guangji Hospital refused to send a doctor are unfounded. Mr. Weng's relatives, hearing that Mr. Chen and his party had acted righteously and that Mr. Weng had been rescued in time, intend to have his family express their gratitude. As for the worker who carried Mr. Weng to the hospital, efforts are currently underway to investigate his name and address and to find a way to reward him.</p>
<p>Mr. Weng's condition has now greatly improved. His temperature and pulse have returned to normal. He is now consuming milk and other beverages, and his appetite is good. According to the doctors' preliminary examination, his brain and eyes are not affected. However, due to excessive blood loss, he is still weak. He has been conscious in recent days. Because Mr. Weng is concerned about public affairs and eager to recover, he is eager to have the bandages removed as soon as possible. The doctors still instruct him to rest quietly. It is now known that Dr. Niu Huilin came to Shanghai on the evening of the 19th. After taking care of personal matters, he returned to Hangzhou the next morning to specialize in his medical treatment. Instructor Qian Changzhao is still staying in Hangzhou to take care of everything. His family has also arrived in Hangzhou.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the fact that the rural economy in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces is on the verge of bankruptcy and that the city has a similar situation, with a large number of poor farmers within the central area of the city, and at this early spring, when there is a shortage of food, it is particularly pitiful. Therefore, the head of the department was instructed to plan relief measures. The head of the department had previously summoned municipal commissioners from the Yin Xing and Jiang Wan districts and the directors and local guards of Yinxiangtu to inquire about the local situation and the suffering of the common people. On the one hand, the Tongren Fuyuan Hall was consulted to donate 300 yuan, which was deposited in the Jinyuan Rice Store in Shenjia Lane, and rice tickets were printed and distributed. On the other hand, the Public Security Bureau was requested by letter to investigate and report on the extremely poor and poor households in the central area of the city for verification. Yesterday, the fourth section of the bureau dispatched staff to conduct on-the-spot investigations together with the local guards of each map and distributed aid based on the number of people. This will help the livelihoods of the general poor farmers.</p>

<p>Still Actively Underway</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee and local authorities in the disaster areas have been actively providing relief after last year's Yellow River flood, the relief work in various counties in eastern Shandong and in Lanfeng and Wuzhi in Henan has largely come to an end. However, Huaxian County in Henan, which was the most severely affected, still has 100,000 disaster victims. The Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee is currently planning to remit 10,000 yuan for relief. In addition, the first district of Wuzhi County, which covers more than 30 square miles, has the lowest terrain, and the authorities are currently carrying out drainage work. Once the drainage is completed, more than 10,000 mu of fertile and lean land can be obtained. As for the disaster refugees, it is now planned to relocate them to the nearby provinces and counties that have not been affected by the flood, and the authorities of those provinces and counties are requested to find ways to settle them. At the beginning of this month, 4,000 to 5,000 refugees were relocated near the Pinghan and Daoqing railways.</p>

<p>Due to last year's floods in Xian County, Hebei Province, a group of refugees, led by Duan Zhenfeng, consisting of 23 men and women, fled to Guangdong Province to beg for food. They arrived in Shanghai after many twists and turns and were lodging in various places in Zhabei. Similarly, refugees from Raoyang County, Hebei Province, also suffered from the disaster. Led by Ge Liangyou, consisting of 26 men and women, they went to Guangdong to seek relatives but were unsuccessful and wandered in other places. They arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and jointly requested relief from the Xinwei Relief Association, represented by Duan Zhenfeng and Ge Liangyou. Considering that it was not a long-term solution for the refugees to be stranded in a foreign land, the association issued each person a "Refugee Free Boat Ticket," a total of 49 tickets, and dispatched staff to negotiate with Wang Shengyi Ticket Office to ensure proper arrangements. Last night, the association escorted the 49 men and women refugees onto the Yihe Company's Dingsheng Wheel to return to their hometowns. It is reported that the ship is scheduled to sail to Tianjin this morning (the 22nd), and they will then be sent back to their hometowns separately.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Ministries of Finance and Communications Approve Measures for Collecting Customs Duties on Postal Parcels <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance stipulates that goods traveling to and from the interior, passing through customs, are not taxed. However, merchants take advantage of this provision, often sending postal parcels from the interior to trading ports to post offices near the ports to avoid taxes. This kind of clever smuggling not only results in tax losses but also inevitably leads to other corrupt practices. The Ministry of Finance consulted with the Ministry of Communications to instruct post offices and the relevant Customs Superintendents to draft measures for inspecting and collecting postal parcel taxes. It is now learned that the measures have been jointly agreed upon by the Postal Administration and the Customs Superintendent and have been carefully reviewed by the Ministries of Finance and Communications. The revised measures for collecting customs duties on postal parcels traveling to and from the interior are as follows: (1) Postal parcels traveling to and from the interior that pass through two or more trading ports will be inspected and taxed by customs, except for those that are exempt from tax according to regulations. However, if the goods are transported on the same route and are not required to pay customs duties, then postal parcels will also not be taxed. If they only pass through one trading port, customs will generally exempt them from inspection and taxation. (2) Postal parcels sent by land or railway in the interior will be exempt from inspection and taxation if the places they pass through are not within the customs' taxation scope. (3) The opening, inspection, and resealing of postal parcels that are subject to inspection and taxation will be jointly handled by customs and the post office. (4) The tax amount for postal parcels that need to be taxed should be estimated by the customs of the last trading port. (5) The customs duties that should be collected on postal parcels will be collected by the post office at the post office of arrival, based on the tax amount estimated by the customs, and 10% of the total amount will be deducted as a handling fee for the post office for collecting the tax, and the remaining amount will be remitted to the customs. If there is a difference in the currency systems between the two places, the post office may collect the exchange premium from the taxpayer. (6) These measures will take effect after being approved by the relevant departments of customs and the post office, and the specific rules for implementation will be determined separately.</p>

<p>The tragic situation of the floods in Dongping, Shandong, was previously reported by the Red Swastika Society, and people from all walks of life have donated generously. It is now reported that two Han brothers, accompanied by their parents, went to the Red Swastika Society on Danshui Road yesterday and donated 20 yuan, which they had saved from buying candy and firecrackers during the Spring Festival, to help the disaster victims in Dongping. The elder brother is named Han Shaoqing, aged eight, and the younger brother is named Shaochang, aged seven. The children's disaster relief comes from sincerity, and Songjiang Zhuang Shenshen is not the only one who can be praised.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Match Association Petitions the Ministries of Finance and Industry for the Promulgation of Incentive Measures <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The National Association of Match Manufacturers previously reported that the domestic match industry was affected by foreign factories manufacturing matches in China, and its business was declining. The association submitted documents to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, requesting the prompt implementation of incentive measures for domestic matches to provide relief. Subsequently, the Ministry of Industry issued approval No. 8439, stating, "The submission has been noted. We will wait for the Ministry of Finance to review and reply before deciding on the implementation measures for compliance." It has been many days since then, and the approval and decision to implement the measures have not yet been received. Moreover, the unified tax rate has recently been increased by one and a half times, and manufacturers feel that the burden is too heavy. If incentive measures are not decided and implemented soon, it will be even more difficult for domestic matches to compete with foreign matches. Therefore, the association has once again submitted documents to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, urging them to promptly decide and implement incentive measures for domestic matches to provide relief and maintain the industry. Subsequently, the Ministry of Industry issued approval No. 8803, stating, "The submission has been noted. This Ministry has provided opinions and consulted with the Ministry of Finance for review. We will wait for the reply before issuing instructions for compliance."</p>

<p>If Shoe Merchants Are Not Satisfied</p>
<p>They May Appeal to Customs in Accordance with the Regulations</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously reported to the Shoe Industry Association that shoe materials are imported and taxed according to the regulations, and after they are made into shoes, they are re-exported and should not be taxed again. The Chamber of Commerce reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the tax on re-exported shoes be reduced or exempted. If this is not possible due to general regulations, the ad valorem tax should be changed to a specific tax to maintain sales, etc. The Ministry of Finance has now issued a reply, stating, "The submission has been noted. The styles of shoes manufactured in recent years are becoming more and more innovative, and the prices are also different. Customs inspection and assessment are based on the true market price, and it is not possible to enforce a uniform standard. The original letter from the Shoe Industry Association stated that the tax was 10 cents per pair last time, and this time it is necessary to pay 12 cents or 16 cents per pair. What kind of goods are these shoes? No samples have been submitted for detailed description, and it is impossible to verify. If the shoe merchants are not satisfied with the tax levied by customs, they should, in accordance with customs regulations, lodge a protest with the Customs Superintendent within the specified time, requesting that it be sent to the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee for review and submitted for approval to provide relief. The request to reduce or exempt the tax on re-exported shoes, or to change to a specific tax, is difficult to approve. Please immediately notify the Shoe Industry Association of this reply."</p>

<p>After Sending Representatives to Reply, They Dispersed</p>
<p>There are more than 400 large and small stores in the southern goods industry in this city. Historically, the three major festivals of each year have been the period for dismissing employees. Since 1929, after the Southern Goods Workers' Union submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, it was agreed that February 28th of each year would be the period for dismissing employees. However, in recent years, the business of various stores has declined, and the old practice is still being used. Last year, more than 500 people were laid off one after another. The workers, due to the difficulty of making a living, have requested that the labor union find a way to settle them, but this has not yet been realized. Yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m., more than 60 unemployed workers in the industry went to the union on Fuyou Road, demanding that representatives be sent to negotiate with the trade association to arrange for their settlement and maintain their livelihoods. The union then sent staff member Yu Yaoqiu to meet with them. Yu Yaoqiu replied to the workers, saying that the union would, in accordance with the provisions of labor-management conditions, submit a negotiation to the trade association, requesting the organization of an unemployment referral office to implement settlement. As for the unemployed workers, they should first register with the union and wait quietly for a solution. The workers expressed their satisfaction and dispersed at around 4 p.m.</p>

<p>Formulating Uniform Measures for Driver's Licenses</p>
<p>To Be Implemented from April 1st This Year</p>
<p>Since the highways of the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai have been gradually completed under the supervision of the competent authorities of each province and city, traffic within the five provinces and cities will inevitably become more and more convenient in the future. However, due to the failure to unify various management regulations in the past, there have been many inconveniences. Therefore, the competent authorities of the five provinces and cities have formulated unified measures for automobile driver's licenses in the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai, which will be implemented from April 1st. Anyone who holds a driver's license from this city on April 1st can exchange it for a new unified license from April 1st without additional fees. The unified measures for automobile driver's licenses in the five provinces and cities are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Unified License Measures (1) Anyone driving a car within the five provinces and cities must hold a unified automobile driver's license issued by the Transportation Committees of the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai.

When necessary, the Transportation Committees of the five provinces and cities may send personnel to assist. (7) The unified license number should be prefixed with the characters for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai for easy reference. (8) Unified licenses should be divided into the following two types, and the license fee for each type is eight yuan: (A) Professional driver's license; (B) Ordinary driver's license.

(9) Learner's permits will be handled by each province and city themselves, but they may not be valid in other provinces and cities. (10) The original regulations for managing drivers and issuing driver's licenses in each province and city will continue to be valid, except for those that conflict with these measures, which should be handled in accordance with these measures. (11) Detailed rules for the implementation of these measures will be formulated separately. If there are any matters not covered, they may be amended at the standing committee of the Transportation Committees of the five provinces and cities. (12) These measures will be resolved by the standing committee of the Transportation Committees of the five provinces and cities and sent by letter from the National Economic Council to the governments of each province and city, with a date set for simultaneous promulgation and implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Japanese Merchants Argue Against Japanese and American Dumping <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Saying It Is Impossible</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun yesterday, recently, Chinese newspapers have repeatedly reported that Japan will dump surplus rice on the Chinese market. However, according to Japanese merchants, the propaganda in Chinese newspapers is unfounded. The reason is that the cost of importing Japanese rice into Shanghai is 12 or 13 yuan per 100 catties, including import duties, while the market price of Chinese rice in this city is around 5 yuan. In comparison, Japanese rice is definitely difficult to sell in China. Moreover, the Japanese parliament is currently holding a meeting to discuss rice countermeasures. However, it is inevitable that Japanese rice will be dumped abroad in the future, but this is still impossible due to transportation and tariff relations.</p>

<p>Madness is one of the diseases of civilization. The more advanced and complex society becomes, the more prevalent this disease becomes. It is also related to the seasons. Since the beginning of spring in this city, police stations have been arresting lunatics on the streets and sending them to the Chinese Mental Hospital on Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, through the court for treatment. It is reported that the hospital is large in scale and well-equipped. Within the past week, nine people, including Chuan Shangwen, have fully recovered and been discharged. Among them, the male lunatic Zhang Denggui was arrested by the Yangshupu Police Station on January 31st. The female lunatic Wang Xiubao was arrested by the Laozha Police Station on January 30th. Also, the female lunatic Miao Xu was arrested by the Chengdu Road Police Station on February 9th. The above three people were all sent back to the court by the hospital yesterday with a document as follows: "To the Shanghai First Special District Local Court: We hereby inform you that the male lunatic Zhang Denggui, the female lunatic Wang Xiubao, and Miao Xu, three people, who were sent by your court one after another, have been fully recovered after treatment by this hospital.

<h3 id="e155">The Shareholders of the Hai Feng Flour Mill Appeal Against Xu Hecheng for Fraud and Embezzlement <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Verdict is Scheduled for Announcement Yesterday</p>
<p>The Hai Feng Flour Mill in Haizhou was established in the late Qing Dynasty, during the Guangxu era, by the late Zhang Jian (also known as Zhang Ji Zhi) of Nantong, Yu Shounian of Huizhou, and others, with a total capital of 300,000 yuan. Initially, it was managed by Xu Jiuxiang. After Xu's death in the fourth year of the Republic (1915), the position remained vacant. From the seventh year of the Republic (1918) onwards, Xu's younger brother, Xu Hecheng, took over as the executive manager. However, the mill's business gradually declined, and it became insolvent. Consequently, the board of directors decided to liquidate the mill. Shareholder Wang Xiaowu was appointed as the auditor. The entire mill's property was leased by Hecheng to Gong Ji from the seventh year of the Republic (1918) to continue operations. In the twelfth year (1923), Gong Ji terminated the lease, and it was then leased to Xin Ji. In August of the nineteenth year (1930), the mill's buildings and equipment were insured against fire with Shanghai Dingxin Insurance Company for 100,000 taels of silver. On September 14th of last year, the mill suddenly caught fire and burned down. After Xu Hecheng received the compensation, he did not consult with the shareholders and unilaterally deposited 115,000 yuan of the compensation into the Jiaotong Bank in this city, disposing of the remaining funds freely. This dissatisfied Wang Xiaowu. Wang argued that Xu's appointment as manager of Hai Feng was not approved by the shareholders and was self-appointed. Having seized the title of manager, he took advantage of his position to embezzle the mill's assets. Wang then filed a criminal self-accusation against Xu in the First Special District Court, requesting that he be punished for the crimes of fraud and embezzlement. The initial trial resulted in a defeat for the plaintiff, Wang Xiaowu. Wang, unwilling to accept the outcome, hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, vehemently stating the errors in the original judgment and demanding redress. Yesterday afternoon, the Second Branch of the High Court, consisting of Judges Zhao, Jiang, and Zhou, convened a collegial panel for the hearing, with Judge Zhao as the presiding judge. The appellant's lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, presented the appeal, stating that the appellee had impersonated the manager of Hai Feng and signed two lease agreements with Gong Ji, which constituted fraudulent behavior. As for the embezzlement of assets, the appellant was initially unaware of it, and therefore could not file the lawsuit earlier, until receiving the compensation and auditing the accounts, the appellant discovered that the appellee embezzled the insurance compensation, and the Dingxin Company paid over 125,000 yuan, but only 115,000 yuan was deposited into the bank, and the money was easily accessible, which was a sign of embezzlement, and the appellee paid 8,500 yuan to the insurance company, although someone admitted to receiving the money, their name was not the person who the appellee said, so the appellant thought that the appellee made a substitution on the spot, and the original verdict finding the appellee innocent was inappropriate. The appellant requested that the law be enforced. Xu Hecheng, the appellee, stated that he held 5,000 yuan of shares in Hai Feng, and his brother Jiuxiang held 10,000 yuan. After his brother's death, the position of manager was the responsibility of the board of directors. He was elected as liquidator by the shareholders in the seventh year of the Republic. Due to the passage of time, all written evidence such as letters had been lost. Xu Hecheng then detailed the process of leasing the mill to Gong Ji and Xin Ji twice between the seventh and nineteenth years of the Republic to raise funds to repay previous debts, and the situation of negotiating compensation with the insurance company after the mill was burned down last year. He also presented an account book to prove that the 115,000 yuan of compensation remaining in the Jiaotong Bank had been reported, and there was no embezzlement. Lastly, the appellee's lawyer gave a defense, and the court ordered that the verdict be announced on the afternoon of the 27th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Effective Medicine for Chilblains <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>▲Unbroken Chilblains! Swelling Subsides on the Same Day</p>
<p>▲Broken Chilblains! Heals in a Few Days</p>
<p>Chilblains are caused by the coagulation of stagnant blood. They initially appear as red and swollen areas, causing unbearable pain and itching. Once ulcerated, they ooze with pus and cause even more severe pain. This condition is particularly common in winter, but effective treatments are scarce, causing suffering for patients. Now, Zhengwei Pharmacy (west side street of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road) in this city has developed two effective medicines: (1) "Pearl White Jade Paste," used to treat broken chilblains, removing decay and promoting new growth, with rapid healing; (2) "Chilblain Wish-Fulfilling Water," used to treat unbroken chilblains, instantly stopping pain and itching, and quickly reducing redness and swelling. The prices are extremely low. "Pearl White Jade Paste" is sold for only forty cents per package, and "Chilblain Wish-Fulfilling Water" is two cents per bottle, two yuan per dozen. Wholesale prices are especially cheap. For mail orders from other cities, add two cents for postage.</p>

<p>▲Dropsy Worry-Free Pills Achieve Great Success</p>
<p>▲Praised by the National Medical Community</p>
<p>Dropsy is considered a terminal illness by the Chinese medical community, and Western medicine also has no effective cure. The only option is to use knives and needles to open the abdomen, but the dropsy will soon return. Therefore, only one in ten patients can be cured. Since Shanghai Zhengwei Pharmacy (west side street of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road) invented "Dropsy Worry-Free Pills," it has saved many lives for more than ten years. All those suffering from dropsy, abdominal distension, qi deficiency with fullness, women's blood dropsy, and children's malnutrition and food accumulation can be cured with this pill. Therefore, the national medical community considers it a groundbreaking miracle drug and recommends it widely. The effectiveness of this pill is both great and fast. Mild cases can be cured with half a dose, and severe cases can be cured with one dose. A detailed instruction manual is provided. Send two cents for postage for a mail request. The price is 20 yuan per dose, 10 yuan per half dose, and 5 yuan per box. Mail orders from other cities do not require additional postage.</p>

<p>Sold for Only Fifteen Yuan Per Dan</p>
<p>Compatriots Should Pay Special Attention</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that nearly 100 dan of the first batch of imported Japanese fish arrived on the Japanese ship "Manyimaru" the day before yesterday. They are all fresh small yellow croakers, caught in the sea near the Ma'anshan Islands along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in China. Each dan is sold for only fifteen yuan, more than twice the previous price. According to a report, one fishing boat imported more than 4,000 dan of Japanese fish in 1932, worth more than 85,000 yuan. This is only in Shanghai, and other ports are not included. It is reported that Japanese fish merchants are now mixing fish caught in Japanese fishing grounds with fish caught in Chinese fishing grounds in Qingdao and selling them in various places. Various salted fish are also being mixed. Recently, they have been using rapid freezing methods to pack fish caught on the original ship into cardboard boxes and directly transport them to various parts of China for sale.</p>

<p>Reply from the Shanghai South District Fire Association to Wu Huatai</p>
<p>The Shanghai South District Fire Association replied to lawyer Wu Huatai, stating that it received the letter and acknowledged its contents. The association appreciated his concern for local public welfare and the well-being of the people. The association agreed that rescue nets were indeed excellent, but after studying the pros and cons, it found them not very satisfactory. Because the net is made of rope, the knots will weaken over time. Once weight is applied, it will break. This is extremely dangerous. Therefore, canvas is used, called jumping sheets. Although there is a slight recoil when jumping down, it is much safer than rope nets. Last year, when the new municipal government building was completed, the association participated in a high-jump performance. Those who jumped from the fifth floor were caught with the canvas. Jumping sheets are necessary for fire departments for emergency rescue. The association hopes Wu will continue to provide advice.</p>

<p>Recently, a man named Ding Zhongfu impersonated a lawyer and defrauded people. At the end of last year, he impersonated lawyer Ding Shimin and dared to appear in the First Special District Court. The opposing lawyer knew Ding Shimin and noticed the unfamiliar Ding Zhongfu called Ding Shimin, the opposing lawyer suspected that Ding Zhongfu may be Ding Shimin's sub-agent. After the trial, the opposing lawyer mentioned the issue to Ding Shimin, and Ding was surprised to learn that he had no sub-agent. Ding had been defrauded by Ding Zhongfu. Ding Shimin investigated the matter and found that Ding Zhongfu rented a house at No. 22 Yide Lane, Penglai Road. The authorities went to the address at dawn yesterday. Ding Zhongfu was still in bed.

<p>Xu Yuying Requested a Temporary Suspension</p>
<p>Petitioned the Supreme Court for a Change of Venue</p>
<p>Ji Juemi, the manager of Hartung, was accused of seducing the young girl Xu Yuying. The first trial ruled Ji not guilty. The plaintiff was not satisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The trial was originally scheduled to begin the day before yesterday afternoon, but it was suddenly postponed. The reason for the postponement was that Xu Yuying submitted a request to the Second Branch of the High Court before the scheduled hearing, requesting a temporary suspension, stating that she had separately submitted a request to the Supreme Court to transfer jurisdiction of the case and instruct another court to hear it. The Second Branch of the High Court believes that the case cannot be tried before the Supreme Court makes a decision on this issue. Therefore, in addition to approving the postponement, it has now submitted a request to the Supreme Court for review.</p>
<h3 id="e163">The First Special Court Examines Clerks <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Adopting a Mock Trial Method</p>
<p>Examinees Record in Court</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Court held an examination for court clerks yesterday afternoon. The examiners were Liu Yugui, a judge of the Criminal Division of the court, Chief Prosecutor Xiang Zhexun, and Ms. Tang Weishu, the chief clerk of the Criminal Records Section. The examination site was the Sixth Civil Court on the third floor of the court. Most of the examinees were clerks from the court, but there were also many students from middle schools and above. In total, there were about thirty to forty men and women. The examination method was different from ordinary examinations. There were no questions or essays. Instead, a mock trial method was used. Therefore, the courtroom was used as the examination site, and there was no need for special arrangements. The three examiners sat on the bench in their original roles, but all were in plain clothes and not in uniform. The examinees sat in the center of the court, each with pens, ink, paper, and inkstones on their desks. The court bailiffs acted as the litigants, such as plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses, all of whom were present. Judge Liu then simulated a lawsuit and began the trial. The witnesses were questioned one by one, and Secretary Tang took notes. Chief Prosecutor Xiang also rose to argue the charges after the testimony. The only task of the examinees was to record the testimony of the litigants and the instructions of the judge. It is said that the criterion for grading and passing in the future will be based on the accuracy of the records. Secretary Tang's records will be used as a model. This type of examination is new and practical. The court first adopted this method last month for the examination of translators, and this is the second time.</p>

<p>Chen Ronggui's Wife Followed Him to the Grave</p>
<p>Leaving Behind Elderly Parents and Young Children</p>
<p>丨Old Jiatai Managerial Department Fined 500 Yuan丨</p>
<p>Chen Ronggui, a 38-year-old Suzhou man residing at No. 126 Jiuxiaochang in the city and working as a writer at Mee-Yeh Foreign Firm at No. 16 Guangdong Road, was heading home from work at around 5 PM on May 12th of last year when a flagpole falling from the roof of the Old Jiatai Tea Shop's back entrance at No. 6 Dazimingzhong, Dong Sheng Pawn Street, which is Old North Gate Main Street, struck him on the head and injured him. He later died of his injuries, leaving behind an elderly mother, Chen Zhang, in her sixties and blind, a widow, Chen Huang, and five children, as well as a virgin sister. Chen was the sole breadwinner. Since Chen's death, the family was in poverty. His relatives negotiated with Old Jiatai Tea Shop for compensation to support the family. The shop denied any negligence. The family retained a lawyer and filed a complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing Old Jiatai Tea Shop owner Ye Jishan and manager Pan Jucai of causing death by negligence, requesting a trial according to the law, and seeking 50,000 yuan in damages. During the trial, the widow Chen Huang became ill due to grief and worry. By August, she also died, leaving behind her children and following her husband to the grave. Chen's mother, Chen Zhang, retained a lawyer and continued the lawsuit. The trial resulted in a verdict of not guilty for the defendant. The civil claim was dismissed. The plaintiff appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Following trials, investigations, and deliberations, the court issued a verdict the other day. The verdict stated that the original judgment regarding Pan Jucai was revoked. Pan Jucai was found guilty of causing death by negligence and was fined 500 yuan. If the fine is commuted to imprisonment, it will be calculated at three yuan per day. The rest of the appeal was rejected.</p>

This violates the boycott policy and indirectly promotes sales for others. Please ask the Chamber of Commerce to inform all trade associations to treat Zhengxing Paper Company (which traffics in enemy goods) in the same way and not deal with it to serve as a warning.</p>

The payment of 65 yuan by each tenant will be deducted from the rent first. (B) The new house will be rented from March 1st. At the end of the meeting, the rent reduction issue had not been resolved, but the rest was settled.</p>

<p>Wusong Agencies Submit Document to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Tang Chengzong, a member of the Wusong Municipal Council, submitted a document to the municipal government to facilitate traffic and promote municipal development, requesting that public buses be operated. The document stated that while rail transport between Wusong and Shanghai is convenient, there are no public buses to the city center. All travelers must take a detour, wasting both time and money. Convenient transportation is the first step to municipal prosperity. Therefore, he requested the municipal government to order the China Merchants Public Bus Company to operate public buses from the city center to Wusong Town and Paotaiwan, passing through the Water and Electricity Plant, Yinhang Town, and Zhanghuabang. The number of passengers will not be small, and the business will likely develop. The markets in Wusong and Yinhang Towns may prosper due to convenient transportation. The government agencies in the area will also find it more convenient to travel directly without detours.

<p>Subsidizing Farmers' Economy Achieves Significant Results</p>
<p>The Zhenxing Woolen Mill in Xujiahui Road in this city specializes in imitating serge, woolen cloth, and Shuanglong brand woolen yarn with domestic raw materials. The products are of excellent quality and low price. Since its sales, it has been famous all over the country. The general manager of the factory, Gu Xiyuan, sees that foreign goods are flooding the market, money is flowing out, and the rural economy of our country is bankrupt and all industries are declining. If we do not seek to revive the rural economy, promoting domestic goods is equal to singing a high-sounding tune. Therefore, in addition to working hard in the textile industry, Mr. Gu also raised funds in Nanxiang Town last year to organize the Zhenxing Rural Side Industry Association, purchasing looms, releasing yarn for weaving cloth. Since its opening, it has achieved remarkable results. It is reported that the association is now planning to add dozens of looms to expand its scope, so as to avoid the regret of the villagers. It is hoped that those who are enthusiastic about reviving the rural industry will quickly start planning.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Interior issued a circular to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Instructing publishing and distributing houses to comply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Interior issued a circular to the Municipal Government stating: "Regarding the approval of Industrial Ministry’s document number 8781, it opens with the National Bureau of Weights and Measures reporting: 'Upon investigation, the new system of weights and measures has been gradually and widely implemented. Currently, there are numerous books published nationwide, yet many still use the old system or the systems of Britain, America, and Japan. If this is not strictly rectified, it will greatly hinder future standardization. It is proposed that Your Ministry forward a circular to the Ministry of Interior to instruct the entire country that, hereafter, when reviewing new publications according to the Publication Law or Copyright Law, if it is discovered that they employ units and names not in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the Weights and Measures Law, and Articles 52 and 53 of its revised implementation rules, they should be returned with instructions for correction. However, if necessary, an annotation of the equivalent value in other systems may be attached. As for books that have already been reviewed and registered, please also instruct that they be corrected upon reprinting. For those already printed, a simple conversion table and a list of corrections should be attached to each copy to assist in promotion and demonstrate permanent standards. This matter concerns the transmission of culture. Is this appropriate? We hereby respectfully submit this for your review and adherence, etc.' In light of this, it is found that published books are the pioneers of culture. If the weights and measures used in books do not comply with the current system but continue to use the old system or foreign systems, it not only violates laws and regulations but also hinders promotion. The Bureau’s requests are feasible. Please investigate, verify, and report back for handling, etc.' Approved. In addition to separate distribution and replies, we hereby issue a circular requesting you to examine and instruct the publishing and distribution establishments within your jurisdiction to comply. We hope to receive a reply."</p>

<p>Due to the expansion of Apple's business, he is often away from Shanghai</p>
<p>He will remain an Economic Committee member after resigning as Convener</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee has been divided into an Economic Committee and a Design Committee. Each committee member has made great efforts to promote national goods. Recently, Hu Xiyuan, General Manager of the Apple Electric Factory, due to the expansion of factory operations, with branches and distribution centers being established in major commercial ports, and his need to frequently inspect business in other locations, believes he lacks the time to serve as the convener of the Women's National Goods Movement Economic Committee, fearing he would be holding a nominal title, hindering the national goods movement. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Women's National Goods Association resigning from his previous position. The original letter is excerpted below: "To the esteemed Association, since the establishment of the Association, Xiyuan, with his limited talents, has been following the gentlemen who are enthusiastic about national goods, working in various ways, hoping to contribute a bit of his foolishness. At the previous meeting, the Economic Committee and the Design Committee were created. Xiyuan was mistakenly trusted and promoted as the convener of the Economic Committee. As this concerns the national goods movement, he dared not neglect his duties. However, due to the recent outward expansion of his personal business, he spends more time in other locations. Economics is the driving force of everything. If the convener is holding a nominal title, he fears it would hinder the future of the national goods movement. Therefore, Xiyuan is willing to remain as a member of the Economic Committee, and requests that the Assembly elect another person for the convener position to avoid delaying important matters, etc."</p>

<p>Hiring Two Lawyers to Demand Punishment of the Culprit and Compensation</p>
<p>The preparatory office of the rickshaw pullers' union, yesterday at 3:00 PM, convened a meeting during which the family of the deceased Ji Xueqing reported that the deceased, at approximately 10:00 AM on February 12th, pulling rickshaw number 6650, registered under British jurisdiction, was traveling on Nanjing Road from west to east. At the entrance of Sanyang Southern Goods Store, he obeyed the rules of the concession, and stopped upon seeing a red light. Unexpectedly, the driver of public bus number 15071, Han Chunlin, traveling from east to west, disregarded the Public Works Department’s order to stop at a red light, driving like a shooting star, swerved across the road from the south side to the north side, completely destroying rickshaw number 6650 and fatally injuring the rickshaw puller Ji Xueqing, who was torn apart. The union was requested to uphold justice and provide assistance, to seek justice, etc. The committee members discussed the matter and determined that the bus driver Han Chunlin lacked driving experience, recklessly caused a fatal accident, was extremely negligent, not only damaged the rickshaw business but also treated the lives of rickshaw pullers as a game. The bus company should be held responsible for negligence in hiring. As a result, committee member Chen Guoliang was publicly selected to hire lawyers Wu Kaisheng and Chen Wenxiang as representatives of the family, demanding three points according to law: (1) Ji Xueqing was tragically killed, with an estimated loss of one yuan per day from the age of twenty to fifty, amounting to a minimum compensation of 10,000 yuan, in addition to expenses for clothing, coffin, and the damaged rickshaw; (2) demand that the bus company strictly prohibit inexperienced people from driving, guaranteeing that this type of disaster will not happen again in the future; (3) severely punish the perpetrator Han Chunlin according to law, to redress the injustice.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiahe steamer, conscripted by the military last month along with the Taishun, Guangli, Xinming, and Wuyang, to transport the 19th Route Army to Nanjing and then to Henan for reorganization, was carrying troops to Nanjing and then to Fuzhou when it ran aground in Zhenjiang. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Aground Mid-Voyage: The Jiahe steamer transported troops from Fujian to Nanjing, unloaded them, and then set sail for Fuzhou with military supplies. It then loaded Fujianese troops to transport them to Pukou. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 20th, the Jiahe steamer ran aground on a shoal opposite Shierxu upstream from Zhenjiang, due to the error of the river pilot. The ship was deeply mired, and it was impossible to escape the predicament.</p>
<p>Military Terminates Charter: After the steamer ran aground, the shipowner immediately telegraphed for help to Nanjing and Shanghai. The Naval Transportation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, concerned that there were military supplies on board, urgently dispatched a ship to the grounding site to transfer the contents of the Jiahe, as well as the soldiers, to another steamer for transportation to Fuzhou. The Naval Transportation Department, under pressure to transport cargo, could not wait long and telegraphed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, terminating the charter of the Jiahe.</p>
<p>Company Rescue Efforts: Yesterday, upon receiving the report, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's shipping department discussed rescue plans. In addition to telegraphing the Zhenjiang branch to attempt to dispatch a ship to tow the Jiahe, they also sent a letter to each of the Zhaotai Insurance Companies regarding the cause of the Jiahe steamer's grounding and the rescue plan.

<p>Zhang Changfu, a deceased Ningbo native who was a comprador for the French business Pathé Records, located at 120 Route Lafayette in the French Concession, was kidnapped by bandits in the French Concession on November 12, 1928, and a large ransom was demanded. After being held for a week, his family paid the ransom. The French police subsequently arrested twelve kidnappers, including Xu Liugen, Zhu Ada, Zhang Shilin, He Yingshan, and Li Shuilin, who were sent to the former French Court for trial. The defendants confessed to the kidnapping and were sentenced to five years imprisonment each, after which they were to be handed over to the mainland authorities for further proceedings (however, many of the defendants, such as Xu Liugen, died in custody of illness; only Zhang Shilin (from Wuxi), He Yingshan (from Sichuan), and Li Shuilin (from Ningbo) survived). Now, with their five-year terms completed, the Second Special District Prison transferred Zhang, He, and Li to the Second Special Court for review and notified the police. Yesterday, Judge Qiu Huan Ying questioned them in the Criminal Court. First, Police Lawyer Yao Zhaodi presented the case. Zhang, He, and Li all testified that they were not involved in the kidnapping, had been wrongly detained, and had been imprisoned for five years, requesting vindication. Subsequently, Detective Zhang Daorong, who handled the case, reported on the investigation and arrest of the defendants after the kidnapping occurred. The court ordered the case to be postponed until March 2nd and instructed the detective to produce a written report for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Truly, a Case of Extreme Cruelty</p>
<p>The family of the old lady, surnamed Wang, who resides in Gaochang Lane, is originally from Ningbo. She is 51 years old and has three daughters. Her second daughter, Huiqin, is 18 years old this year. On January 1st of the current year, arranged by matchmaker Peng Chen, she was married to Quanlun, son of Zhuang Xiuru (who works as an accountant at Yuxinxiang Foreign Goods Store in Dapuqiao). Quanlun works at the Xiangxing Knitting Factory on Daji Road. Unexpectedly, just three days after the wedding, Huiqin was slapped and beaten by her husband. Unable to endure the abuse, Huiqin returned to her mother's home and wept to her mother. Old Lady Wang was about to go to reason with him when Zhuang Quanlun accused Old Lady Wang of fraud and reported her to the district police station. The police summoned them to the station and, upon hearing the matter, deemed it a minor issue and a family matter. The police advised both parties not to take extreme measures and to reconcile. The police advised Zhuang Quanlun to take his wife back and reconcile. The incident subsided. However, just a few days later, Huiqin returned home twice more, weeping, saying that all her jewelry had been taken by her husband and that she had been beaten. Old Lady Wang, out of love for her daughter, comforted her and let her stay at home for the time being. She planned to send her back to her husband's home after reconciliation. Unexpectedly, at around 8 PM the night before, Old Lady Wang was beaten by Zhuang Quanlun and others, even to the point of extreme incontinence and being covered in excrement. She was severely injured and was rushed to Nanyang Hospital for treatment by her family. Yesterday afternoon, Old Lady Wang was transported by the hospital's ambulance to the District Court, requesting an examination.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e208">Reading Guidance: Preliminary Reading of Social Sciences (II) <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>1. Regarding asking friends for advice, "Because they are influenced by the academic theories of various social science schools in contemporary society, and their views are inconsistent, the books they recommend are also different." This is not surprising. This is not only because they are influenced by academic schools, but also because their future social life determines which academic school they accept and which academic school they __. At that time, you yourself are the same. Do you like to eat sweet or salty? This depends on your taste. No matter how eloquently others speak, you will not believe them, so-called "the more they explain, the more confused I become." However, you __ have not tasted the flavors of various things clearly. If you have a little ability to distinguish, you will not make this sigh. (Regarding recognizing correct theories and distinguishing the authenticity of academic schools, please refer to the penultimate paragraph of the article "The Dispute of Theories and the Grasp of Correct Theories" in the January 10th issue of this column. I will not repeat it here.)</p>
<p>2. Your friend's suggestion that you first "clarify economics" is generally correct. Economics is the central science of social sciences. However, I don't know your level well, so whether this answer is applicable to you seems to still be a question. If you simply don't even have the basic knowledge of an overview of social sciences, it will be very difficult to study economics immediately. Before studying economics, you naturally need to do some preparatory work. You should have some basic knowledge of materialist dialectics and be familiar with some of the situations on the main aspects of economic phenomena. Otherwise, the methods used in economics will make you even more dizzy and confused. After reading the problems discussed inside, you will inevitably feel dry and tasteless. You don't understand the methodology of economics, you don't understand the logical order of economic research, you can't understand its mysteries, let alone feel it is dry and tasteless?</p>
<p>At the same time, the reading order proposed by your friend is also open to discussion. For example, it is correct to clarify economics and then study law and politics, but it is simply a logical inversion to list history and geography as the last things to read. History and geography are necessary knowledge before reading social sciences and are a means of studying social sciences. It should be placed at the beginning to be reasonable.</p>
<p>3. If we are talking about readers who have not yet entered the door of social sciences, we feel that the reading order should be changed to: first read a world history and one or two volumes of Chinese and foreign geography. Slightly prepare some historical and geographical knowledge. Then start reading a book on the overview of social sciences to slightly know a little about the overall concept of social sciences. Continue to read preliminary books on economics and gradually make an in-depth study of this subject. When you have a basic knowledge of economics, then go on to study what is law, what is the state, what is morality, what is art, etc. This is a path.</p>
<p>This path is logically correct, but human life sometimes deliberately violates logic. Some people only like to listen to sweet songs, but can't understand the tune of "Yangchun White Snow." What can be done about that? There are really many people who linger in front of the door of social sciences and then avoid it. They are afraid of the difficulty, "It's too dry and tasteless!", but they don't have a way to overcome this difficulty. The bitterness of those who retreat is, of course, a greater failure on the part of the educators. We should overcome this "difficulty", so I now propose another path.</p>
<p>This path is specially opened for people who stand in front of the door of social sciences and are afraid of difficulties and cannot enter. Anyone who has already entered the hall, you can continue to move forward, don't turn around and change your journey!</p>
<p>This path is quite easy to walk. Even people who usually only like to read novels can definitely not feel dry and tasteless or too strenuous if they follow this path, and they can still reach the hall of social sciences in the same way.</p>
<p>First of all, the readings we choose are soft "biographies," that is, first read the biographies of first-class social scientists, revolutionaries, etc. Biographies not only give you literary interest, but also give you methods for studying social sciences, show you how difficult it should be to do scholarship, increase your courage to self-study, defeat and shame your own cowardice, and make your people unknowingly assimilated and responded to. Imperceptibly, you will no longer find the word "difficult" in your dictionary.</p>
<p>Continue with "biographies," then read a history of revolution. This is a very lively book. After reading it, you will want to read more. In the meantime, you can also learn a little about the past changes of mankind, gain a lot of experience, and enlighten you on the future of mankind. This is also a book that general people should read.</p>
<p>After this, you can first read a book on the outline of social problems, know a little about what has happened in contemporary society; read a history of social movements to know what people in the past and present are planning to solve these social problems. Then you read a history of social evolution, know some of the laws of social evolution, and at this time, you must feel dissatisfied. Although you know many historical facts, you lack the ability to explore the causal laws of these historical facts, and you naturally want to make more fundamental research. If you really have the determination, then turn around and browse one or two books on the outline of social sciences. At the same time, attack philosophy (referring to __ materialist dialectics) and economics. In philosophy, you can acquire not only methods for studying economics, but also means for understanding the entire universe and society. In economics, naturally what you acquire should be all the knowledge for dissecting the economic structure of capitalist society. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e210">The Irrationality of Shanghai <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Satire</p>
<p>Modern people, when speaking, naturally have to bring some modern flavor, so new terms such as "economic downturn," "scientification," and "rationalization" often flow on the lips of those modern men and women, especially in Shanghai, where they can be heard everywhere. However, we look at everything in Shanghai society with a cold eye, but it is the most irrational, the most unscientific, and the exposure of the economic downturn is also the most obvious!</p>
<p>Let's put aside unscientificality and the economic downturn for the time being, and simply analyze all the irrational situations in Shanghai:</p>
<p>For example, abolishing the lunar New Year, in principle, a place like Shanghai, with its culture open and soaked in foreign atmosphere, should be very deserted. However, the facts are exactly the opposite. Gun-like firecrackers have been set off for six or seven days, and have not stopped yet. Game halls, theaters, and hotels are also announcing that they are full every day. All kinds of hustle and bustle are several times more than in the inland. On the road, young men in Western suits are cupping their hands, and doctoral gentlemen who have returned from abroad are shouting congratulations. In the Hong Temple, there are modern ladies who often appear in the Paramount dance hall burning incense...</p>
<p>Also, Shanghai is known as the source of Chinese culture. Many national and private universities have opened. The Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao distributed from Wangping Street travel all over the place and can almost be called representative newspapers of China. In principle, the interest of Shanghai people in reading books and newspapers must be very strong. However, as far as I know, Shanghai is full of football fans, theater fans, opium addicts, and gamblers, but it lacks "bookworms"! A large discount from a bookstore allows you to buy three and a half pounds of new books for one dollar. When a bookstore closed for the New Year, it sold brand-new literary books to its counterparts for five yuan a load. The counterparts bought them, and also said they were looking at their boss's face!</p>
<p>Also, the Children's National Goods Year, the Women's National Goods Year, and the ×× National Goods Promotion Week have been going on in Shanghai for almost the whole year. So, needless to say, no one buys Japanese goods at all. However, the facts tell us that the best market for Japanese goods is still Shanghai!</p>
<p>Also, there are the most foreign firms in Shanghai, the most comrades in Western suits in Shanghai, and Shanghai people speak the most foreign languages. In principle, all old-fashioned things in China should have been eliminated without a trace in Shanghai. However, Shanghai people are the most superstitious. Those who break down characters can make a fortune in Shanghai, and the income of the City God Temple, Jing'an Temple, and Hong Temple can exceed the income of a county government in the interior by several times or more. Moreover, many of those who donate enthusiastically are people who have received higher education and great thinkers who write articles every day advocating social reform!</p>
<p>Of course, the irrational phenomena in Shanghai are by no means limited to the few points I have listed above. Fortunately, most of them are extremely obvious, so I don't need to write much more.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Odds and Ends After a Thorough Cleaning <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The same time, the same month and day, when the lunar year comes to an end, there is naturally an unspeakable busyness. Even families are doing all kinds of silly things that bother people, such as "sending off the Kitchen God," "thorough cleaning," "thanking the gods," and "staying up all night." The officialdom prohibits it on its own, and each family holds it as usual.</p>
<p>Among the things done at the end of the year, "thorough cleaning" is relatively interesting. Because there is always a lot of dust, dirt and rubbish in a house. Although it is also cleaned daily, there may be some imperfections. At the end of the year, a big clean-up is done, sweeping away cobwebs, rat droppings, broken bottles, and broken bowls. If you change it to a new term, it is "cleaning movement," isn't it nice and fashionable!</p>
<p>Cleaning the house a little, it always feels more comfortable. Let's take an individual as an example. If one is covered in sores and scabs, and it is uncomfortable to scratch, how comfortable it is to soak in a scalding pool. The prisoners in prison are covered with lice and dirt. Once they get out of prison, they hurry to shave their heads and take a bath, and then __ regain __ health. The meaning of this "thorough cleaning" is __ __ what I said on the side.</p>
<p>But __ can __ only __ clean the filth in the house, but what about cleaning the __ on the body, and the inner foulness, danger, greed, meanness, depravity, and obscenity? I don't know what method can be used to clean them all away. Even though medicine is developed, the syphilis virus can be injected with 606; the rotting of the throat tube can be injected with serum. Only the virus and rot in the heart cannot be thought of.</p>
<p>Looking at the world stage, there are many places where war clouds are thick; there are many places where there is unemployment and panic; there are also political instability, and there are also social downturns. Can all of these be swept away? To see it smaller, in the society we are in, there is opium, gambling, trading, kidnapping, robbery, rape... Can these many stains be swept away?</p>
<p>Cleaning, cleaning, after all, is just a nice word for people to beautify their faces. You can sweep away the filth on the outside, but can you sweep away the foulness in the heart?</p>
<h3 id="e212">Odds and Ends <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Guiyou is the year of the Rooster, and Jiaxu is the year of the Dog, which is exactly the same as the Rooster and Dog living beings, making them disturbed and unbearable. Our China may be as pitiful as Rooster and Dog scraps.</p>
<p>Originally, the Rooster has five virtues, and the Dog has righteousness. They are both domestic animals loved by people, but when the Rooster flies on the roof, and the Dog cries at night, people think it is unlucky. However, thanks to Lord Mengchang, it was only because of the diners who crowed like roosters and stole like dogs that he was able to safely escape Hangu Pass.</p>
<p>"A hen crowing at dawn" is used to describe a woman in power, which is inherently inappropriate. Because in the past, women were always subjugated to men and made playthings. It has not changed for thousands of years, but it is not right now. The call for raising women's rights and liberating men and women is getting higher and higher. Almost all men are now turned into servants of dressing tables. Perhaps the hen crowing at dawn has become a reality!</p>
<p>"The Shu dog barks at the sun" is also an exaggerated phrase. Literally, dogs in Sichuan bark wildly when they see the sun. Because Sichuan has many mountains and it is difficult to see the sun, the Shu dogs bark wildly when they see the sun. This means that sitting in a well and looking at the sky, what you see is small. Maybe Shanghai people say that people from other places lack sophistication, calling them diehards. However, if you drop a literary phrase, you can also say that it is the Shu dog barking at the sun.</p>
<p>"Chickens and dogs ascend to heaven" means that everyone enjoys the benefits of one person's good fortune. Nowadays, many people in authority, once they get their way, then his father's party, mother's party, and wife's party, these three parties can rely on him alone to enjoy happiness. What a lucky thing this is! So, if a commoner wants to get ahead, may I ask if he has a maternal uncle or brother-in-law who is a big tycoon? Alas! Needless to say.</p>

<p>— Wonderful God</p>
<p>Recently, radio stations can be described as flourishing. However, the wavelengths used are mostly in the longwave range. And the power, apart from the Central Broadcasting Station, was originally no more than 500 watts. Therefore, the broadcasting range only reached the southeastern provinces. Now, the local International Radio Station has built a new shortwave broadcasting station, with a massive power of 25,000 watts. Its broadcasting range can reach the entire world. It is said that during the trial broadcasting the other day, a report from London stated that the sound was clear and loud, and the effect was excellent.</p>
<p>Few outsiders know the content of this station. At the invitation of the station's engineer, I once went to visit the broadcasting room. I found the decoration magnificent, unmatched by any broadcasting room on the sea. The broadcasting machine and all other components are produced by the British Marconi Company. The broadcasting machine is located in Zhenru, and the broadcasting room is located in the Sassoon Building in the city. Remote control is used for communication. I only visited the broadcasting room; I didn't go to the Zhenru machine because it was too far. The broadcasting room fully adopts the decoration of an Oriental palace, and also takes into account artistic patterns. The roof is decorated with gold and red, and embellished with golden dragons, etc. The four walls are all decorated with calligraphy and paintings, embedded on the walls. The layout method is unique and not purely Oriental. Because it is in a steel-concrete building, many scientific facilities are also used. When broadcasting, in order to avoid echoes, the four walls are covered with velvet, and the floor is covered with extremely thick carpets. It is said that the velvet and carpets alone cost more than 3,000 yuan. The electric lights in the broadcasting room are shaped like palace lanterns and are entirely made of glass, which are quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Recently, trial broadcasts are often conducted from 8 or 9 pm every night, with a wavelength of 26 meters. Formal broadcasting will begin on February 3. However, this station is not entirely for entertainment purposes. If this city wants to talk to London, it only needs to pay a considerable fee, and it can be done. It is essentially a commercial long-distance wireless telephone.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p>
<p>Drinking Wine and Passing Dishes, Merrymaking with Tears of Farewell</p>
<p>Lighting a Lamp, Dreaming of Low Singing, Passing a Long Night</p>
<p>Guizhi smiled and said, "There are only two taels of wine in total, and you drank half a cup in one gulp. Are we just going to eat vegetables from now on? You probably haven't heard me sing ditties yet. Let me sing a little bit for you." Ziqiang smiled and looked at him, saying, "You can sing? I really didn't know that. What kind of ditty can you sing?" Guizhi twisted his head with a smile and said, "I can sing a few, but I'm afraid the old man will hear me and scold me." Ziqiang smiled and said, "Just sing softly, it's okay. You and I sit hugging the corner of the table. Anyway, no matter how low you sing, I can hear you." Guizhi picked up the wine cup and smelled it, pretending to want to drink it. But as soon as it got close to his mouth, he put the wine cup down again, smiled, and said, "I won't sing. I don't sing well, and you'll laugh at me." Ziqiang saw that he wanted to sing, but he was also afraid to sing. He didn't know how to say it properly. So he picked up the cup and just smiled at him. At this moment, the distant sound of the night watchman, along with the wind, was sent into his ears. Guizhi搶着 (搶着, not "snatching" but "taking the initiative to" or "quickly") smiled and said, "I'll sing anyway. But ditties are not elegant. I'll sing a big opera for you, okay?" Ziqiang smiled and said, "You can sing big opera too? That's even better. What role do you sing?" Guizhi smiled and said, "Everything is a mess. I can sing a few lines of anything. My best is 'Yang Guifei Gets Drunk.'" Ziqiang stretched a hand over from the corner of the table and gently patted the back of his hand, saying, "This opera is very good. Just sing this one. Besides, I'm already drunk." Guizhi, hearing this, really coughed lightly twice, and then, with a smile, began to sing softly. While he sang, he listened to the outside, listening to the sound of the night watchman on the street, to see if it was far away. Only when he couldn't hear the sound of the night watchman at all did he stop singing. (318)</p>
<p>Local Customs Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e215">Suzhou at the End of the Abolished Lunar Year <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Men Shayu</p>
<p>Our country is indeed a country that preserves the old. Although the lunar calendar has been abolished to this day, customs and habits are still deeply rooted and difficult to change. The sound of firecrackers and the clamor of drums create a scene of peace and prosperity. In Suzhou, at the end of the abolished lunar year, of course there are many "old rules of the year" that are carried out according to precedent. Writing them out now is also a kind of local custom anecdote.</p>
<p>Burning First Incense</p>
<p>Although the government has repeatedly issued orders and expressly prohibited superstitious acts of worshiping Buddha and burning incense, those who prohibit do so, and those who do it do so. It has long become a mere formality on paper. In Suzhou, where incense is very popular, not to mention old-fashioned women, even modern girls and intellectuals are prostrating and worshiping under the idols in the county. At midnight, when New Year's Eve and New Year's Day meet, in the Sanqing Hall of Yuanmiao Temple, in front of the sixty star deities, candlelight is already flickering, and incense is wafting. Many pious men and women are worshiping and rising and falling. According to popular custom, the earlier this star incense is burned, the sooner one can get blessings and prosperity at the beginning of the year. Therefore, a group of people who want to have good luck early sit and wait for dawn, rushing to burn the first incense. Especially the courtesans of the northern districts, come in convoys of cars, with the fragrance of rouge and powder, intermingling with the incense and red candles in the hall, forming a rich atmosphere.</p>
<p>Circulating in the Auspicious Direction</p>
<p>Everyone likes to seek good fortune. Those bright and understanding gentlemen need to seek good fortune and avoid evil even more. Therefore, on New Year's Day, the first day of the new year, they must first check the almanac to see which direction the God of Joy is in and which direction the God of Wealth is in. Then they go out the door and follow those directions. There are still many people who circulate in the auspicious direction in modern times.</p>
<p>Olive Tea</p>
<p>Although colorful banknotes are now popular, and silver dollars are also being naturally eliminated according to the law, the people still support and worship yuanbao (元寶, silver ingots) from beginning to end. When it comes to the end of the year, the year cake is made into yuanbao, the olive is called yuanbao, and the dishes with yuanbao are countless. The society is full of the sound of "yuanbao". At the end of the abolished lunar year, two olives are added to each pot of red tea in Suzhou's teahouses, called "yuanbao tea," to please the tea guests. This custom has been followed for a long time and is still practiced today.</p>
<p>Welcoming the God of Wealth</p>
<p>The God of Wealth is just the God of Wealth. According to the "Investiture of the Gods," when Taigong Wang was on the Investiture of the Gods platform, he invested five Gods of Wealth, who were in charge of human wealth. This absurd mythology is depicted in divine scrolls and deeply imprinted in the minds of the people, especially a group of merchants who value profit, who hope to bring the God of Wealth into the store so that their profits will be great. Therefore, on the fifth day of the first lunar month, homes and shops prepare large pieces of meat, whole chickens, and whole catfish, and welcome the God of Wealth with gongs and drums. After the shopkeepers welcome the God of Wealth, they make a feast of the fish and meat used to welcome the God of Wealth, calling it the God of Wealth wine, and then open for business and resume business.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Lighting and Extinguishing the Lamps <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The lamps are lit on the thirteenth day and extinguished on the eighteenth day. According to Suzhou custom, on the night of the thirteenth, red candles must be lit in front of the enshrined divine scroll in the hall, called "lighting the lamps," and they are lit every night from the thirteenth to the eighteenth. After the eighteenth, the divine scroll is put away and the New Year's scene is cleaned up. On the nights of lighting and extinguishing the lamps, glutinous rice balls and round cakes must also be offered in front of the divine scroll. During these days, in Suzhou's Song Xianzhou Lane Mengjiang Hall, candles as thick as arms are burned in front of the gods, and red men and green women go in groups, which is very lively, called watching "big candles." At night, there are also firecrackers to add to the fun.</p>
<p>In addition to the above items, which are customarily followed, Suzhou's New Year's customs also include the fashion of riding in horse-drawn carriages on Jinlü Road during the New Year. A group of carefree friends holding flowers gallop back and forth on the road to show off their wealth. In recent years, the flower market has been depressed, and cinemas have flourished, and riding in horse-drawn carriages has been eliminated invisibly.</p>

<p>The Suzhou YMCA will hold an exhibition of more than 200 recent works by the famous painter Tao Lengyue starting on February 18, lasting for seven days. At each of Tao's past painting exhibitions, celebrities from home and abroad have spared no expense to seek his works, and his reputation has spread throughout the art world. Tao has served as a professor at various universities, and his footprints have covered half the world, so his paintings have been aided by famous mountains and great rivers, and are strange, majestic, and extraordinary. Last autumn, he accepted an invitation to teach at Sichuan University, entered Sichuan for a tour, and this spring, he went east again to climb Mount Heng to explore the scenery, and the smoke and clouds under his pen have become even more spectacular.</p>

<p>Easily Defeated Xiqing Yesterday</p>
<p>This year, the perennial champion Zhongqing team in the Xiqing Volleyball Group A did not participate. All the volleyball masters in Shanghai are in Jiangwan. Therefore, Jiangwan's strength is exceptionally strong. Players such as Qiu Guangxie, Cao Tingman, Xu Heng, Chen Baoqiu, Cai Tiange, Xie Baochang, and Wei Dingyi have strong waists and arms, and their spikes are like cannonballs. Although Xiqing is fierce, Zeng and Mai Ling are also strong, but yesterday they were hit hard by Jiangwan and had no way out. As a result, Jiangwan won three games in a row, with a total score of 45 to 17. It is very likely that they will win this year's championship. Also, Mai Ling defeated Yi Ling with a score of 2 to 1, with a total score of 40 to 27. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangwan Wins 15 to 6, 15 to 7, 15 to 4. Xiqing 4, 5 to 17</p>
<p>Mai Ling Wins 15 to 5, 15 to 丨5, 15 to 7. Yi Ling 4, 0 to 7</p>

<p>The Hubei Provincial Government Approves the Establishment of a Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>Immediately Notify All Provinces to Prepare to Participate</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, The Fifth China Central Games, originally scheduled to be held in Wuhan in the 20th year of the Republic of China, was to be prepared by the former Hankou Special City Education Bureau. Later, Hankou City was transferred to the Hubei Provincial Government, and the association was taken over by the Jiaoyu Hall. A preparatory committee was immediately established, and a budget was prepared, including the conference period expenses and repairs to the public sports field, totaling more than 37,700 yuan in national currency. It was submitted to the provincial government meeting for approval. At that time, due to the severe flood disaster, it was ordered to be postponed to the spring of 丨year. The event was again postponed for one year, and the General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces ordered a temporary postponement. As a result, the conference has been postponed for more than three years. Cheng Qibao, the director of the Jiaoyu Hall, believes that developing national sports and holding competitions in conjunction with the provinces of Central China should not be delayed any longer. On the 15th, a meeting was convened to decide to hold the games in mid-May. According to Article 7, Section 6 of the Charter of the China Central Sports Federation, a preparatory office should be organized one month before the games, and all provinces should be notified to prepare to participate. Now that the deadline is approaching, a preparatory committee should be quickly formed to plan and proceed. Regarding funding, in addition to the preparatory expenses, sports field repair expenses, conference period expenses, and expenses for the province's athletes, which should be paid by the province, the travel, food, and other miscellaneous expenses for athletes and staff from other units will be borne by the units themselves to save money. As for the venue, both Wuchang and Hankou are suitable. However, Wuchang is the provincial capital, and there are many schools, so more athletes can participate. The Provincial Public Sports Field has hosted the Third National Games and the Seventh National Football Regional Games, and the scale is roughly complete and easier to repair. Therefore, the above methods were proposed as a proposal to the Provincial Government's regular meeting on the 20th. After discussion, it was resolved to approve the establishment of a preparatory committee. The sports venue will be determined according to the equipment conditions of the sports fields in Wuhan, and the required expenses will be budgeted by the Jiaoyu Hall and submitted for approval.

<p>Shanghai sports referee Shen Huichun served as a referee at the Jiaotong University Stadium on the afternoon of December 16 last year. The game was a football match between Jiaotong University and Jinan University. As a result, Jiaotong University lost by one goal. Jiaotong University students Qin Shaoji and others blamed the referee for being unfair and surrounded Shen to make things difficult, and even beat Shen. After Shen Huichun went to the local court to request an examination of the injuries, prosecutor Tang Ruxiu confirmed that Shen was indeed injured and prosecuted the case to the criminal court. A public hearing was scheduled for the 21st of this month. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the case was due yesterday. At 10:00 a.m., Shen Huichun and his lawyer, E Sen, reported to the court. Subsequently, Judge Guan Liting specially opened the thirteenth court for trial. Shen and lawyer E attended the court at the same time. After the judge briefly questioned Shen, he said that the defendant Qin Shaoji had not arrived today and had submitted a petition requesting a postponement. The hearing would be rescheduled after another date was set. The court was then adjourned.</p>

<p>Tonight Qingbai Plays the Eagles</p>
<p>The Hankou Qingbai basketball team played for the second time last night against Vanaraja at the John Basketball Hall. Unfortunately, they lost again with a score of 45 to 33.</p>
<p>However, last night's battle situation was much better than the night before. The first half ended with a tie of 18 points each. The closeness of the score was unexpected. According to Vanaraja players, it was because they were using Qingbai's ball, which was too light and did not meet the weight requirements. Starting in the second half, they switched to Vanaraja's ball, and Vanaraja gradually took the lead and surpassed the score. Naturally, they won with a score of 45 to 33.</p>
<p>Although Qingbai lost, their performance last night was better than the first day. Their offense and defense were brave and extraordinary, and their shooting was also very beautiful. Vanaraja's performance was messy and less impressive, and it seemed not as good as usual. The referee was Tao Zunan.</p>
<p>Tonight at 8:30, Qingbai will play the Eagles at the Chinese Basketball Hall.</p>

<p>At 4 pm on the 23rd at the Chinese Baseball Field</p>
<p>The Hankou Qingbai basketball team was organized by Wu Shaoshu, Yang Xing, Jin Dan, Cheng Yi, etc., of the Hankou Municipal Party Committee, based on the evening star and the all-blue teams. From the beginning of its establishment, it had the ambition to go on an expedition. First, it entered the capital and won four games and lost one, singing a triumphant song. Now it has returned to the sea to seek a surplus of courage. Although the team was unfortunately defeated by Jianhua by a score of 47 to 61 in the first battle on the 10th, victory or defeat is the norm in war. The team is happy to have met a strong opponent and learned from each other. Yesterday, at 丨1 pm, the team held a joint celebration at the Shanghai Silk Industry Building on Sanma Road, inviting reporters from various newspapers in Shanghai and inviting Pan Gongzhan, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Tong Hangbai, a member of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee, to accompany them. During the banquet, the guests occasionally talked about football and felt a strong interest. However, although the Shanghai reporters have an organization called the Wangping Street Veterans Team, the Qingbai team is a basketball team, and the nature is slightly different, so the competition seems inconvenient.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Qingbai team decided to organize a temporary football team to play a friendly match with the Wangping Street Veterans Team. Now both sides have agreed on a battle date, and they will test their skills at the Chinese Baseball Field tomorrow (23rd) at 4 pm to connect the joy of the two cities. Pan Gongzhan will kick off the game, and Shen Huichun will referee. It is expected that there will be an extraordinary performance, leaving a good story in the Shanghai football world. The lineups of both sides are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>▲The Entire Qingbai Team Will Participate</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Dai Xibo, defenders Yao Yingyu, Liu Zhangbing, midfielders Yin Zhenwu, Wu Shaoshu, Lu Fuxing, Hu Yingrong, forwards Huang Shijin, Wang Yide, Wang Zhengjun, Cheng Yuehan, Yu Jun, etc. The leader will guide the entire team to show their skills.</p>

<p>Dong Kunfan, a vocational education expert and director of the Fujian Hui'er Orphanage, participated in the Chicago World's Fair last year. The Ministry of Education requested that he take the opportunity to investigate vocational education in Europe and the United States. However, due to Dong's urgent need to return to China to prepare for China's participation in this year's Chicago World's Fair, he was unable to conduct the investigation. It is now learned that Dong has completed the preparations for the Chicago World's Fair and has decided to go abroad for investigation in the near future. He plans to first go to the United States, then to Europe, Soviet Russia, Japan, and other countries. The scope of the investigation will cover the administration and management of vocational education, the management of education for poor children, the vocational problems of poor children, production capacity, sales channels, and a study of the reasons why society and vocational education cannot be integrated, as well as the causes of pauperization. The investigation period is expected to be one year.</p>

(2) Social Education Institutions: There are a total of 704 school-style mass schools, supplementary schools, and special schools. There are a total of 1,055 social-style mass education centers, libraries, gymnasiums, popular lecture halls, reading rooms, literacy stations, entertainment venues, and other social education institutions.

In addition to teaching two hours of necessary civic courses and knowledge every day, most of the time is spent on military training. There are now hundreds of thousands of militias, who receive two hours of education every day, which greatly benefits the promotion of mass literacy education. It is also a special situation in the province. (6) Future Plans: In order to meet modern needs, the province plans to transform the middle schools in various counties into rural normal schools and vocational schools. Many provincial middle schools have now been transformed into vocational schools.

The National Basic Education Research Institute has been established to carry out the plan.</p>

More than 400 alumni attended, making it a grand occasion for a time. The school was surrounded by colorful electric lights that were dazzling. The huge red electric "Longevity" character in front of the Friendship Room was particularly brilliant. Today, the students in the school held a celebration, including a games and other fun programs.

<p>▲Chairman Pan's Speech: At 8:30 pm, Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered the opening speech, saying that today we are celebrating President Bu's 70th birthday, but he has been running St. John's University for 50 years. His contribution is very great. Fifty years ago, China was just starting to run new education. President Bu's birth seemed to be specially for China to run new education. St. John's has produced many talents who serve the society. This is all thanks to President Bu. Next, Mayor Wu gave a speech, "The Purpose of Chinese Education." Xiao Zhiji then read congratulatory telegrams from Shi Zhaoji, Yan Huiqing, and more than 30 alumni associations in New York, Beiping, Kaifeng, Nanjing, Changsha, and other places.

Excerpts from the speeches are as follows: It was broadcast by radio station last night at that time.</p>
<p>▲Mayor Wu's Speech: Today is the annual meeting of the St. John's Alumni Association, and it also happens to be the eve of President Bu's 70th birthday. Tiecheng is very honored to participate in the grand event. President Bu has devoted his energy to St. John's University for many years, and his achievements are remarkable and praised by everyone. Today, there are many students, and President Bu's teachings are like the warmth of the spring breeze. His spirit is strong, and he is old but not declining. As the saying goes, it is rare to live to seventy years old. Now President Bu's longevity has reached the age of seventy, and President Bu's direct and indirect contributions to society and the world are even rarer and more valuable in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. St. John's University has a long history in China. St. John's graduates have served in various national and social agencies for many years, not only in large numbers, but also with outstanding reputations. Such commendable and great achievements are not accidental, nor can they be expected in a short time. Of course, it is the result of President Bu and all the faculty and staff's hard work for many years and enthusiastic cultivation. We cannot but express our deep respect for President Bu and all the faculty and staff's perseverance and spirit in educating talents, and we cannot but express our ardent expectations. Education is a great force that promotes culture and drives the nation. Ancient China's governance was based on education, which produced China's beautiful culture and created China's glorious and brilliant history. However, the purpose of education must be able to adapt to the needs of the nation, and the needs of the nation should adapt to the great trend of the times. The education of a country must be built on the purpose of adapting to the great trend of the times and the needs of the nation in order to generate power, promote culture, and drive the nation. Although modern Chinese education has also undergone many reforms, it has failed to truly adapt to the great trend of the times and the needs of the nation, resulting in today's decline and an unprecedented national crisis. The narrow nationalism of education has been rejected by the great trend of the times, and it is also incompatible with the Chinese national spirit and the spirit of the Great Harmony of Wangdao. However, China's inherent beautiful culture, long history, and special and important position should not be ignored by anyone who is objectively concerned about world issues and by educators with foresight. The direction of current Chinese education, driven by the times and the environment, has shown a significant tendency to change. The spirit of this change is undoubtedly to attempt the revival of the nation, on the one hand to restore our nation's inherent ability to create culture, and on the other hand to absorb and improve its production technology. The function of this educational purpose can not only develop and enrich the power of the country, but also make a great and unlimited contribution to the future of world culture. Tonight, Tiecheng hopes to celebrate the development of St. John's with this point of view, and at the same time, to celebrate President Bu's birthday with this enthusiasm.</p>
<p>▲Wang Zhengting's Speech: Dr. Wang Zhengting's speech briefly stated that President Bu's morality and learning are admirable, and what makes us most admire him can be summarized in three words: loyalty, constancy, and clarity. Loyalty is connected to love. President Bu is loyal to the school and is willing to sacrifice his position and rights rather than abandon St. John's. This is why St. John's is St. John's. Confucius encouraged people to be constant. Great men and leaders in ancient and modern times can only succeed if they are constant. President Bu has worked hard day and night for 50 years. It is truly what is called decades as one day. His spirit of running the school is the second thing that can be learned from. Clarity means having a broad vision. Educators must have a broad vision. President Bu can integrate ancient and modern thoughts and cultivate talents. Education changes with the environment. President Bu was able to see the Chinese society of many years later many years ago and cultivate talents from all walks of life. St. John's alumni are all outstanding, which makes people admire him even more.</p>
<p>▲President Bu's Speech: President Bu Fangji's speech briefly stated that he was deeply grateful for the opportunity to come to China and create this St. John's University. The mainland newspaper reported that St. John's was founded by me alone, which is a big mistake. Therefore, secondly, St. John's success is due to the concerted efforts and cooperation of all the colleagues and faculty in the school. Moreover, the success of St. John's is due to the alumni association's loyalty to the alma mater, which is unmatched by other schools. In the rest of my life, I would like to travel to the east, west, north, and south of China, as far as Xichuan, Chengdu, and Chongqing, to visit my alumni in various places. This will be very gratifying.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Two! A Heart! A Face! <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>In this era of foreign goods dominating the market and rural areas declining, everyone sees the national products industry as dim and hopeless. Those who run national products factories are frowning, believing there is no way out. While this is the reality, a closer look reveals that the future of national products is only bright, not dark; only developing, not declining. It depends on people. As long as everyone has the determination and perseverance.</p>
<p>Two Keys</p>
<p>Those running national products factories only need to grasp two keys: One is thorough cooperation, from cooperation among the same industry to cooperation between different industries. Shift from the previous mindset of jealousy and infighting to a united effort of mutual assistance in production and sales, resisting the dumping of foreign goods. The other is reducing costs. What methods can be used to reduce materials and labor while accelerating and increasing production? What records can be kept to constantly examine what is unreasonable and uneconomical, providing a basis for continuous improvement and savings? In short, the life of national products depends on everyone's efforts to improve products, not on surviving through price drops and shoddy workmanship.</p>
<p>A Sincere Heart</p>
<p>The term "Buy National Products" is almost universally known, and everyone considers it a valuable undertaking. Even the average wife, madam, and young lady believe it is a very stylish thing to do. If you don't believe it, you can visit a national products company and see that women who love using national products are just as numerous as men. However, everyone must have a sincere heart, or in other words, a sense of faith. With faith, even if the goods are slightly inferior or the prices are higher, they will be patronized because of a spirit of sacrifice.</p>
<p>A Smiling Face</p>
<p>For those who sell national products, the most important thing is a smiling face. They interact with customers who love national products every day, and their greatest effort lies in their responses, greetings, voices, smiles, and expressions. Deadpan faces and grumpy faces are not what should be seen in a national products company. If you offend one customer, you not only lose a year's worth of business but also scare away other enthusiastic customers. Losing customers is like being an enemy of national products. Therefore, if you are not going to be a clerk in a national products company, that is fine, but if you are going to be a clerk, first look at your own face.</p>
<h3 id="e252">New Year's Delight <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Shuying</p>
<p>丨Discovered a New National Product丨</p>
<p>Throughout the year, there are two things that I find most unpleasant: One is that every time Wang Ma brings the wash water to the dressing table, when I go to wash my face, the mirror on the dressing table is always covered with a layer of fog due to the steam from the hot water. I have to wipe it three or four times with a dry cloth before I can see my reflection. I wash my face three times a day, and each time it is so annoying and unpleasant. The other is that every time I eat, as soon as I bring the bowl of rice close to me, my glasses fog up due to the steam from the rice, forcing me to take them off. However, my nearsightedness is so severe that I cannot see without my glasses. This is even more painful than the fog on the dressing table mirror. All year round, I am troubled by these two small things! "The scientific community has already invented wireless technology, why hasn't there been an invention to eliminate the annoying fog?" I often think to myself. On January 16th, I got up in the morning and was bothered by the fog again. As usual, I first flipped through the day's newspaper and then went to suffer the second round of fog. Suddenly, I caught sight of a striking advertisement stating that a Tiangong Industrial Company had invented a wonderful product to remove fog, called "Yun De Xiao." If you apply it to any glass surface, all fog will be repelled. "Is there really such an invention?" I exclaimed excitedly, and without even eating a proper breakfast, I immediately rushed to the only national products store, the China National Products Company.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the China National Products Company, my eyes greedily darted around, searching for what I needed like a hungry wolf. At first, I thought that "Yun De Xiao" should be sold in the hardware department, so I went to the hardware department, but it wasn't there. "Maybe it's in the cosmetics department?" I thought, and went to the cosmetics department, but it still wasn't there. I was confused. Didn't the advertisement say that the China National Products Company was selling it? And it's a national product, the national products company should sell it, why isn't it there? Later, I asked the person in charge of the company, and found out that it was sold in the "pharmaceuticals department," so I went straight to the pharmaceuticals department.</p>
<p>In the glass cabinet of the pharmaceuticals department, rows of small, beautiful, flat, round boxes dazzled my eyes. The packaging was very beautiful, with a friendly purple-rose color, and a line of elegant characters in the middle, half in Western script "WindshieldA" and half in Chinese "Yun De Xiao." Next to it was a price card with a few rounded characters: "50 cents per box."</p>
<p>"Such a small box, selling for 50 cents, that's so expensive!" As I thought this, my forward-rushing body seemed to be retreating. However, I seemed to hear a clear voice: "Useless rouge and powder cost more than 50 cents." This voice gave me great courage, and I bought a box without hesitation.</p>
<p>After returning home, needless to say, I was eager to open it and try it out. However, I was too careless. It turned out to be a powder with a slightly blue tint. I opened it at an angle, so when I opened it, the powder scattered everywhere. I quickly put it down flat, but much had already been wasted. After opening the box, I followed the instructions and first wiped my glasses. After wiping them, I breathed on them and, sure enough, no fog formed. I was delighted.</p>
<p>"Wang Ma! Wang Ma!" I called out in a joyful voice. Wang Ma came in and, seeing me acting like a madwoman, was stunned. I instructed Wang Ma on how to use "Yun De Xiao" to wipe the mirror. She did as I said, brought a basin of wash water and tried it on the dressing table. Wang Ma was also so happy that she almost went crazy.</p>
<p>It has been more than half a month since then. I live in a happy mood every day. From then on, I am no longer troubled by the fog that has been bothering me all year round, and Wang Ma also seems to have much more free time.</p>
<p>Do you think this national product should be introduced? I say not only should it be introduced, but it should also be promoted. However, one thing I want to ask the Tiangong Industrial Company, the inventor of this national product, to pay attention to is that the box should be improved, otherwise, first-time buyers will definitely suffer losses. It is a pity to waste such a useful national product!</p>
<h3 id="e253">Ladies, Have You Forgotten? <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Qiacheng</p>
<p>Ladies, have you forgotten our painful January 28th Memorial?</p>
<p>Two years ago, when cannons, airplanes, warships, and the Japanese army and navy launched a major offensive against Shanghai, what was the situation in Shanghai under the cover of gunfire and flames? Now, the scars have not healed, and the great revenge has not been avenged. Although the sound of cannons seems to have faded away, the broken walls and ruins of Zhabei, Wusong, Dachang, and Zhenru remind us that the events of the past are still vivid.</p>
<p>You must remember this. In addition to the stories of the National Army's resistance, there were also many scenes of women being humiliated and children being massacred. At that time, whether they were victims or residents thousands of miles away, everyone was aroused with an indomitable national consciousness. Not only did they destroy their homes to relieve the national crisis as a temporary measure, but they also had the greatest determination to revive the Chinese nation and take on their responsibilities, sacrificing and fighting for themselves and the community!</p>
<p>Therefore, even the British "gentlemen" who looked down on the Chinese the most would say in their writings and newspapers: "In essence, the January 28th Incident was a victory for China!" This is not a self-serving facade, because the greatest gain at that time was our determination, which was a success that could not be achieved in the various traumas of the past century.</p>
<p>The most obvious is the vigorous and continuous national products movement that swept the country. This was also a result of the January 28th Incident. It was also a concrete manifestation of our greatest determination. It was precisely to revive the Chinese nation, especially to consolidate our own national capital, and to avoid the problem of fueling the enemy from a position of self-defense and protection.</p>
<p>However, the second anniversary of the January 28th Incident has passed, and the expression of that greatest determination has gradually cooled down from its initial fervor. Although beautiful people always blame others for major mistakes, the crime of negligence must still be shared by each of us. The most powerful proof is the large increase in the import of inferior goods. After being punched by others, we greet them with a smile and allow them to dump their goods again. Aren't we just drinking poison to quench our thirst and fueling the enemy?</p>
<p>Ladies, have you forgotten? Our painful January 28th Memorial!</p>
<p>Let me tell you, don't be glad that you survived the January 28th disaster. At a time when everyone is eager to act, if we don't save ourselves early, a disaster more painful than the January 28th Incident will happen again. I am not deliberately making alarmist statements. The facts are before us. Just explaining the two phrases "1936" and "Extraordinary Times" is enough to make us reflect on ourselves!</p>
<p>When I visited Mrs. Pan Gongzhan the other day, she said that the reason why women advocate for national products is to ensure that their precious children do not become slaves of a conquered nation. Her words were earnest and sincere, and truly a wake-up call for our women's circles.</p>
<p>Reporter, ladies, there is no mother in the world who does not love her children. For the sake of our children, mothers should make an effort. Moreover, the past is a warning, the scars have not healed, how can we abandon our sworn oaths, how can we change our greatest determination?</p>
<p>Ladies, have you forgotten? Our painful January 28th Memorial!</p>
<p>On this unfortunate anniversary of Women's National Products Year, our ladies' feelings must be particularly strong. However, empty words are ultimately useless. You reap what you sow. Heaven helps those who help themselves. Only by putting our heads down and working hard can we achieve the expected success.</p>
<p>Let's not fail the January 28th Memorial!</p>
<p>Let's not fail Women's National Products Year!</p>
<h3 id="e254">A Gentle Inquiry <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Li Anfu</p>
<p>Many people say: The use of national products by women is like a Buddhist grandmother pretending to eat vegetarian food; when the Women's National Products Exhibition or National Products Entertainment Fair is held, they have to respond like a Buddhist grandmother encountering the birthday of the Goddess of Mercy. This is naturally an overstatement, but I hope that the women of the future will not actually be said to be like that.</p>
<p>Last year was National Products Year, but according to customs reports, the number of imported foreign goods actually increased compared to the previous year; therefore, some people suggested that next year should be Foreign Goods Year, saying that maybe national products could be sold well instead. Because it is said that Chinese people often like to go in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Practical experience shows: When you go to a fabric store to buy clothing material and cannot tell whether it is a national product or a foreign product, you only need to gently ask the clerk, who will then assume that you like to use foreign products, and he will tell you what kind of product it is. This is the most accurate guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Domestic Glycerin <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Xinsheng</p>
<p>Glycerin, commonly known as "yangmi" (foreign honey), has many uses. It is needed in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, cigarettes, canned foods, printing inks, and other industries. It is also an important material for the manufacture of explosives. Because it is related to national defense, all independent countries have factories to manufacture it themselves; however, no one in our country has ever manufactured it.</p>
<p>Recently, the Wuzhou Pharmacy established a second factory, purchased new machinery, and hired specialized personnel to create domestic glycerin. This is truly a somewhat satisfactory event in the National Products Year! However, starting a business is not easy. You have to work hard in the present and also consider the future. Xiang Shengwu, the current general manager of Wuzhou, said in a speech: "The manufacture of glycerin originally utilized waste materials from soap making, but the reason we are now establishing a new factory is that we have seen the ruthless bombs of the January 28th Incident destroy the essence of Zhabei. Therefore, we are now manufacturing glycerin and do not dare to establish factories in one place. If one factory is destroyed, there will still be remnants, and the foundation will not be completely destroyed." How painful are these words!</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of Wuzhou's manufacturing of glycerin, the Shanghai reporter group has already visited and has made satisfactory and detailed reports in various newspapers; I will not talk more about it here. I heard that the first domestic glycerin to be produced has been decided to use the "Planet" brand trademark and will be officially launched soon, and will definitely be well received by industries and businesses across the country. The types currently being investigated are as follows:</p>
<p>No. 1 (Double Distilled) CP Pharmaceutical Grade Specific Gravity 1.26</p>
<p>No. 2 (Double Distilled Decolored) Tech Industrial Grade Specific Gravity 1.26</p>
<p>No. 3 (Single Distilled Non-Decolored) Tech Industrial Grade Specific Gravity 1.26</p>

<h3 id="e256">Eccentric <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Liaoran</p>
<p>Since science has become enlightened, it has made the spirit of mankind much younger. In science, the old is generally not good, the new is good. For example, using a hot iron to crimp hair to make it fluffy is no longer very fashionable, and it is far inferior to the permanent fluffiness of electric perms. This is certainly the good of the new.</p>
<p>However, "later generations will view today as today views the past." To make many old stubborns flutter. Are the noses of today's youth so high? Don't rush, in twenty years they will be about the same as us. We were also the new party twenty years ago. Wait until they have also suffered blows and see that their arrogance is completely gone, then we can compare who is stubborn!</p>
<p>The conflict lies in the belief that the new is all good or bad, and the old is all bad or good. If the standard is fixed like this, many problems will arise. There is no name for it, so it is named eccentric disease.</p>
<p>Youths wearing Western suits and smoking pipes make the older generation in long robes and mandarin jackets sigh, thinking it is extremely eccentric. When the youth also play with antiques and read thread-bound books, it makes them even more surprised. Have they also taken our path? It turns out that foreigners also read Confucius. And our new things also cover everything. The new is always good.</p>
<p>However, new and old, good and bad are all relative terms. So where is the standard for the new? The hats of Paris women have never been the same, and everyone twists into a different shape, always a little newer than others. However, it is said that in Chinese literature, the literary theories of Lunacharsky and others are not considered new, only Gorky will do; but Gorky has also become an old writer and will not be able to update to where, and it is still not good. Then it still depends on the length of the new writer's hair or the size of his black bow tie.</p>
<p>So it is very difficult to make people feel good these days. Fewer people are playing with national quintessence and Sinology because they gradually feel that although Taijiquan is good, it cannot resist the foreign devils' whips or guns. This is very frustrating, and there is no way to do it. Pilkad is newly thinking of going to heaven, while someone in Shanghai wants to sit on a pillar for sixty days. This should also be counted as a new world record. But what exactly is good?</p>
<p>It is said: It is not difficult to see. In short, come up with something eccentric. For example, when writing an article, cite a large passage from ancient history to create a new type of writing; in painting, mix Western and Chinese techniques together. Westerners look at it as Eastern painting, and Easterners look at it as Western painting. It is best to mix Chinese and English when speaking; when dressing, wear a shirt and trousers inside, then wear leather shoes and overshoes, then add a long robe, then add a coat, forming a style that is neither Chinese nor Western, so that it is neither new nor old and can be used everywhere.</p>
<p>One more thing to pay attention to is that in addition to being eccentric, add a little unintelligible quality to make people feel eternally vague, which can be considered newer and more fashionable.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Pseudo-Manchukuo Students Studying in Japan <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>A friend who just returned from Japan talked about the recent situation of students studying in Japan, which is truly both infuriating and hilarious. Once, a classmate was taken to the police station by plainclothes detectives because of some suspicion. They asked him where he was from? He said: "Republic of China." He was slapped twice. They asked again, and he said: "Liaoning Province." He was slapped twice again. They asked again, and he said: "Fengtian." He was still slapped twice. He thought he didn't want to suffer this immediate loss anymore, so when he was interrogated again, he had to answer: "Manchukuo." Unexpectedly, he was slapped twice again. He really didn't know how to answer. Finally, they asked him, and he said: "Slave of a conquered nation." The Japanese police couldn't help but grin, but he was filled with sadness and burst into tears.</p>
<p>When school opened last autumn, the Industrial University held entrance exams, and all sixteen Chinese students who took the written exam were admitted. Unexpectedly, during the oral exam, only fifteen were admitted. The student who failed the exam went to question the school authorities. The authorities asked him where he was from? He said: "Republic of China." They asked him what province he was from? He said: "Liaoning Province." They asked him, "Does Liaoning still belong to China?" He was panicked and didn't know how to answer, but in order to enter the school, he had to answer against his will: "Manchukuo." The school authorities nodded and smiled and admitted him.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, many Chinese students studying in Japan returned home. Only seven or eight hundred remained. Now it has increased to two thousand, with students from the Northeast provinces accounting for about one-sixth, and the rest being mostly students from the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Hunan.</p>
<p>Originally, there was a Republic of China Student Association in Tokyo, but recently this organization has disappeared invisibly. Should students from the northeastern provinces still call themselves Republic of China students or so-called "Manchukuo" students? This is of course one of the important reasons why the student association could not be organized, not to mention the different ideological factions!</p>
<p>Students who call themselves so-called "Manchukuo" students receive more government funding, at least 100 yuan or more. The Japanese seem to be deliberately trying to win them over, so they are treated relatively well. Some of them also see themselves as superior to Republic of China students, which is truly absurd.</p>
<p>The above records the words of a friend studying in Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Evening <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Cao Ming</p>
<p>That winter, eleven silk factories in our village closed down one after another. When my work was suddenly stopped, I ran to the city without looking back to find work, staying in the home of a young paternal cousin who lived off his father's inheritance. His house, though not very large, had a living room, three rooms, and a spacious courtyard. Besides his elderly mother, there was also a nanny. However, a group of friends who were very compatible with him often gathered there, making noise all night long.</p>
<p>I wanted to escape the eyes of the city people from my country girl's habits, so I often preferred to run to the kitchen to help the nanny cook.</p>
<p>After dinner, Uncle Ba, his friends, and my great-aunt, who held her water pipe all day and refused to let go, were sitting in the living room as usual. After washing my feet in the kitchen, I leaned against the door frame, gazing sadly at the sky, dressed in dim clothes, with sparse stars inlaid all over. In the southern corner, the light blue cold clouds depressingly covered my declining hometown, Shunde. The bright lights in the living room, accompanied by the men's wolf-like conversations, shone through the corridor. Outside the street, the monotonous and brittle sounds of the huqin and pipa vibrated, passing behind our house, gradually being swept away by the cold wind.</p>
<p>My great-aunt, acting like the madness of young people, waved her hand at me almost breathlessly and said, "Lingnu, quickly call Blind Sister in..."</p>
<p>I first put the child in a scarf, shrugged my shoulders, and rushed out of the alley like a fire ship breaking through the waves of cold air. My discontinuous shouts, blocked by darkness, disappeared into the bleak, proud sound of the zither. A withered old nanny, dragging two blind girls, one thin and long, one fat, followed me like a few sheep. The moon, just peeking out with a sorrowful face, calmly and dimly illuminated their careful steps, their shoe soles never leaving the ground.</p>
<p>The old nanny took off their half-new cloaks, and their wind-blown, about-to-tear, purple-red muscles quickly trembled, preparing to absorb the indoor warmth. After they drank the hot tea I poured for them, they mechanically joked with the men in a vulgar tone. When the girls rapidly began to sing, the men pricked up their ears and stared, as if trying to search for something, fixing their gaze on them.</p>
<p>"Where is the toilet?" The song stopped, the old nanny quietly walked to my side, tugged at my sleeve, and asked in a low voice, then pointed to the thin and long one. I took the blind girl to my small room and sat by the bed, watching her gloomy face under the dim yellow light, which contradictorily held a smile with unshed tears.</p>
<p>"Have you been unable to see since you were a child?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"Yes, I have," she said coldly.</p>
<p>"I heard people say that for you singers, smiling is very important," I said, as if dissatisfied with her smile. She responded indifferently with only a nasal sound. I became even more unhappy and added:</p>
<p>"I don't think you've ever cried, have you?"</p>
<p>"To me, isn't it the same!" she said roughly, but then laughed as if to make light of herself, "Really, what's the difference between crying and laughing? I can't see."</p>
<p>"When I was in the countryside, I often heard stories about your life and your godmother..." The chaotic laughter in the living room flashed into the room from time to time, and I continued, looking at her rouge-dyed face, "Do you often feel bad in your heart? Do you hate your godmother?" She frowned but didn't answer. "Actually, people like us who beg others our whole lives are just like crabs in a pot of hot water," I said, and then fell into contemplation.</p>
<p>"People are creatures that eat their own kind, that's how I feel." Her sudden loud voice startled me, and I quickly raised my head. "As long as he grabs that kind of thing. Yes, whoever it is, as long as they grab those filthy things, they can jump up and eat people..." Finally, she ended her words with laughter, "Besides, I can't see anything."</p>
<p>Her face was so serious and gloomy that I stood beside her, feeling like I was tied to the thorny branches of a wild rose.</p>
<p>"Really, I'm often afraid... I don't know what's around me..." she said in a timid voice as she walked through the corridor.</p>
<p>After ten o'clock, the old nanny carefully checked the six dimes she had earned, and the three of them walked out of the gate like a freighter being towed by a tugboat, a string of wriggling shadows slowly dissolving into the black sea.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Interesting Metaphors <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>(10)(4)</p>
<p>He Qiaoyuan wrote to Zhuang Yingshu, saying: "When you write poetry, do you intend to have it read to people while you are still alive? Or leave it for people to read after your death? If you are alive and Zhuang Yingshu is by your side, you can say: My poetry is like this and like that. But if you are dead and leave it for people to read, then you must make your meaning understood by hundreds of generations to come, so that readers can understand it for themselves. You can no longer say from the side, 'Is my poetry like this?'" Many writers often like to seek strangeness and interest in their poetry and prose, intentionally writing in a bizarre way, making it incomprehensible, and instead praising themselves for a kind of originality, even going so far as to explain themselves with thousands of words. If this is true, the interesting metaphor of before and after death, saying the ultimate truth that one wants people to understand, can be said to be prescribing the right medicine for the right disease, leaving them speechless. This is why Li Ning refused the futurist sculptor to create a statue for Karl.</p>
<p>(10)(5)</p>
<p>There are quite a few articles discussing "puppets," and recently, seeing Zhou Qi's letter to He Shengzhai, it was discussed again. He said: "When I was young, I saw puppet shows, two feet long, with many strings, manipulated by others. Recently, they have become only a few inches long, pushed with wooden boards, completely like those who think they are using their own intelligence. Alas! Puppets are also gradually becoming smaller, let alone people. Puppets also do not rely on human strings but want to use their own intelligence. How fearsome and sad!" Now, two hundred years later, their sadness is even greater. Because with puppets, in those days, you knew it at a glance. But now it's not the same. Those that are skillfully made not only make you unaware but even the puppet itself pretends to be serious and explains itself to people. This is how sycophantic literature and comprador literature are produced. Some people say that Chinese history is a history of slavery. In fact, it is also a history of puppets. I wonder if anyone agrees with my humble opinion?</p>
<p>(10)(6)</p>
<p>"Long rain without clearing, everyone dragging mud and water; only when the clouds open and the sun appears, and the right eye is wide open, can one do somersaults in the void. Meeting different peaks, one will naturally create their own writing. Please, Your Excellency, complete the previous words." This is Huang Duanbo's letter to Huang Zi'an. The article is written in a free and elegant style, and the two interesting metaphors, "dragging mud" and "somersaults," are used extremely vividly.</p>
<p>(10)(7)</p>
<p>Liu Dasheng discussed with Yu Jisheng about being an official, saying: "The world considers being an official the most serious matter, and acting in a play the most illusory. But I am very foolish, and every time I see singing, crying, laughing, scolding, jokes, and ad-libs on stage, I am sure that they are real. The reality is not in the ancient people being portrayed, but in the actors portraying the ancient people, each with parents, wives, and children, each having to support their families, each using crying, laughing, and jokes to support their parents and support their wives and children. These actors are the real ancient people. And every time I put on my hat and belt, dress up, and act like an official, I am sure that I am a real official, and no one in the world suspects that I am an actor. I just don't know that the officials who bow and sit, have smiling faces, and act stern and unapproachable, are actually these ancient people who support their families and cry and laugh. So they take a stage, props, scripts, and acting styles, and use them for their entire five internal organs, and don't even realize that they are real actors. How sad!" What this gentleman sees is truly one level above others. He not only tears off the masks of many "officials," allowing us to see the various forms of "officials" in the late Ming Dynasty, but also makes the "officials" of hundreds of years later, who are full of talk about serving the country and the people, unable to laugh or cry. The metaphor is thorough and interesting.</p>

<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>This European gentleman then stretched out his sharp, long nose, but in his hazy, drunken eyes, he gradually discerned that this was not beautiful enough. A "No" hummed from his nose, and he raised his head in disappointment. Then he sang in a low, melancholic voice:</p>
<p>"Where is she? My sweet girl..."</p>
<p>The electric light shone on the head of the man wrapped in a black cloth turban, playing on his rough buttocks for three or four minutes, letting this impatient gentleman get a good look. At the same time, taking advantage of his drunken, muddled state, he asked in a slightly teasing tone:</p>
<p>"Is she beautiful?"</p>
<p>No, No, No, No, No, No,</p>
<p>A series of beast-like screams came from his nose. Then he grabbed my shoulders and shook me wildly, laughing roughly, the strong smell of alcohol rushing straight into my nose.</p>
<p>"Ha Ha Ha Chinaman! Ha Ha Ha"</p>
<p>I thought he probably hadn't recognized that this was a man yet, because, for one thing, he couldn't imagine that there would be such a hotel in the world where unfamiliar men and women would sleep in the same bed. His laughter was probably wondering why I would ask such a stupid question.</p>
<p>He played like this for a while, going to every room to play, but finally didn't find a good-looking girl. Of course, this European gentleman was very depressed, and his mouth was still humming that tune he could never finish.</p>
<p>"Where is she? My sweet girl"</p>
<p>But I was extremely happy, extremely joyful, I simply wanted to run to the top of the mountain and shout a few times, so that the mountains, lakes, forests, and marshes would all know my happiness.</p>
<p>But the flames of his greed had not yet been extinguished. In any case, he still wanted to hunt in other places. I also took advantage of the temporary joy and went to have a good time, so I took him to Old Liu's shop.</p>
<p>The horse yard outside the house was soaked in the clear, cold moonlight. The ground was scattered with pale ink-colored shadows of horses, and the sound of teeth grinding straw echoed everywhere. Occasionally, in the slightly distant place, a horse would snort from time to time. The dry fragrance of straw, mixed with the strong smell of horse urine, drifted in waves with the night wind.</p>
<p>The bonfire burning in the open air no longer had a blazing light, but the red embers still remained. The horse groom slept curled up on the side, his raincoat and the moonlight gently covering his body. The dog heard our footsteps and barked madly. The owner, sleeping on the ground, turned over and scolded roughly. I gave him a polite greeting and walked away quietly. The dog still turned around and lay down quietly.</p>

<p>Commercial News, Finance, and Gold Market Fluctuations are Unusually Strong</p>
<h3 id="e261">Silver Price and Exchange Rate Decline, Resulting in a Rise of Three Yuan and Seven Jiao <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's Listed Sterling Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>March Term Standard Gold Drops by Five Jiao</p>
<p>Although the gold market rose yesterday, the situation was not very stable. The market was erratic and fluctuated dramatically. In the early morning, due to the decline in the overseas silver market, both in the UK and the US, the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange fell by between 2.9 and 5 tenths of a penny. The exchange rate also fell. The price of raw gold in London rose by one shilling, US cotton fell by 15 points, and US wheat fell by 1.25 points. The gross market was quite stable in the early morning, opening and immediately rising, once approaching the 50 yuan mark, but there were no transactions. After the opening, the market was suppressed by the same industry, and the US exchange rate hardened and fell. However, the banks' appetite was still good, and it was still able to recover. After entering the market, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's US exchange rate listing fell by 625 points. The exchange market once tightened. The Central Bank opened the market, and people's confidence was boosted, once approaching the 50 yuan mark. However, due to the abundance of supply at high prices, the same industry continued to suppress the US exchange rate. Buyers seemed scarce. Unfavorable rumors spread in the market, and speculators sold off. The situation suddenly weakened and lacked maintenance. The domestic market hardened, reaching its lowest point at noon. The cost price was 958 yuan. The fluctuations in half a day were quite illusory. Foreign news also lacked special impact. Now, the market situation for half a day will be recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 9- yuan and 8 jiao (April term), a rise of 6 yuan and 2 jiao compared to the previous closing price. Commodities opened at 8 yuan and 3 jiao. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of one yuan and four pence and 4375 for the pound sterling exchange rate, and 34 yuan and 6875 for the US dollar exchange rate. Although the banks were bidding up, the domestic market was instead loosening. Tianfeng, Yongrui, Xingda, Decheng, Yifeng, Yongfu, Yu, Qianchang, Xiangheng, and Yu all sold, and the price fell from 8 yuan and 5 jiao to 6 yuan and 2 jiao. It was learned in advance that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing would shrink the pound sterling exchange rate and the US dollar exchange rate by 625 points. Yuanmao Yong took advantage of the low price to submit a transaction. Mai Jiali ate the US dollar for June at 25 points, rising to 7 yuan and 8 jiao. However, when the second report came, the US dollar only shrank by 375 points. Mitsui also suppressed the US dollar for June by 1875 points. Yida, Yongda, Decheng, and Ruikang sold, retreating to 6 yuan and 5 jiao. After entering the market, the exchange market tightened due to the same industry bidding up. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing did confirm a drop of 625 points for the US dollar. Tianfeng, Yuanchang, Yongsheng, and Da all entered the market. The Central Bank opened the market for 400 transactions, and people's confidence was also good. The price of commodities was strongly raised, rising to 9 yuan and 5 jiao. Mitsui also ate the US dollar for June at 125 points. Zhifeng Yong sold to 7 yuan and 7 jiao and suddenly entered the market. Fuyu also purchased. Zhengjin bidded up the US dollar for June by 1875 points, and then rose to 8 yuan and 9 jiao. After entering the market, the domestic market gradually loosened, and unfavorable rumors spread. Zhifeng Yong supplied transactions again and again. Hengyu and Fuyu also sold. The situation then weakened. Yicheng even sold to 6 yuan and 1 jiao. Zhengjin took the US dollar for June at 25 points. Although it recovered slightly, it was difficult to sell later. People's confidence was already weak. Zhifeng Yong and Yicheng still sold. Under Luo's sell-off, the price fell to 5 yuan and 3 jiao. The closing price at noon was 5 yuan and 6 jiao. After the market closed, Zhifeng Yong came to sell, once retreating to within 5 yuan. Qianchang Xiang Yongfeng came to enter the market. The situation stabilized slightly. Commodities were auctioned at 5 yuan. It was found that the highest price in half a day was 949 yuan and 4 jiao, and the lowest price was 945 yuan and 3 jiao, with a difference of 4 yuan and 1 jiao. As a result, the closing price rose by 3 yuan and 7 jiao compared to the previous closing price.</p>
<p>The quoted price was that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's US dollar listing shrank by 625 points, to 34 yuan and 125 points, equivalent to a standard gold price of 1013 yuan and zero (the March term was still a weak 711 yuan). According to the closing price, approximately 68 yuan and more was discounted, more than 15 yuan compared to the previous closing price. The registered price for this month was 712 yuan, for March 702 yuan, and for April 946 yuan. The supplementary water in the morning was 712 yuan. The cost price of red gold was 958 yuan. Tianjin merchants still sold in the market. The transaction price ranged from 960 yuan to 961 yuan. In addition, Tianjin merchants also sold 99.3% fineness to their counterparts for 961 yuan and 5 jiao. The total transaction volume was less than 2,000 taels. For February transactions, 6,433 transactions remained.</p>
<p>Market transactions were still flat. In summary, Zhifeng, Yongruikang, Yongfeng, Hongxing, Yifeng, Yongchang, Shengyong, and Yicheng were on the selling side. Hengyu, Yuanmao Yong, Zhaofeng, Qianchang, Xianghe, and Futai Hengsheng Da Wanxing Shunli were on the buying side. Fuyu Yuanchun, Ruixing, Bingxing, Dachen, Qianchang Xiang and others entered and exited the market from time to time. Dalian merchants Shunli did a total of more than 700 transactions, entering 70 transactions. Wanxing did a total of more than 700 transactions, entering less than 100 transactions.

<p>The silver money industry always has few major businesses at the beginning of the lunar new year, so the transactions in the market are only done in the morning, and the afternoon is closed as usual. As a result, the market atmosphere is idle, and people's hearts are slack. The foreign exchange rate remains unchanged, calculated as white loans. There were only slight transactions in the small general assembly, about two to three tenths of the market. The transaction volume of discounted bills was more than 1.7 million in the morning market, and more than 400,000 in new transactions. The transaction volume in the small general assembly was more than 300,000. The amount of banknotes recovered and issued was more than 1.1 million.

<p>Disarmament Bonds Break Through the 70 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>Salt Tax Bonds Reach 53 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was in its last day or two of trading for the February futures. The market was still squeezed by too many floating short positions. The buying and selling by various merchant groups was still mostly buying in. The northern merchants even took in positions. The market atmosphere was extremely good. The general public believed that this was an abnormal development, but it was not out of the ordinary. One reason was that there was too much floating capital in the market, with silver lending at no interest. The second reason was that the political situation was stable and the environment was good. There were too many short positions in the market, resulting in a surge that was unexpected by most people. Disarmament bonds broke through the 70 yuan mark, breaking the highest record of July 19, 1933. Salt tax bonds broke through 53 yuan, as predicted by the reporter. What was previously thought to be gibberish has now become a reality. And the prospect is good, not yet to the end of the road. Disarmament bonds at 72 yuan may not be absolutely impossible. Yesterday's process saw the head panel rise by 12 jiao to 34 jiao. Most bond items saw new high prices again. In the second panel, the market was still in a situation of demand exceeding supply. Disarmament bonds broke through the 70 yuan mark, and the rest also continued to rise by 23 jiao. New high prices appeared one after another. As a result, the price rose by 23 jiao to 67 jiao. The total transaction volume was 15,752,000 yuan, with 1,000 yuan in spot goods and 5,200,000 yuan in futures, including salt tax bonds, 1,950,000 yuan in disarmament bonds, 1,195,000 yuan in 19 Customs bonds, 2,220,000 yuan in 20 Volume 20 Customs bonds, 3,670,000 yuan in gold short positive six bonds, and the remainder ranging from 300,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan. Today is the last day of trading for the February futures, and there may still be a squeeze.</p>

<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported on the 20th that the New York stock market was stagnant but strong. Only airline stocks rose by several jiao to more than 2 yuan. This was due to the possibility of air mail being returned to the airlines for delivery. Mr. Gatier, the general manager of the New York Gas Company, declared that public utilities would benefit the latest in the commercial recovery. Utility stocks therefore weakened slightly, and bonds were mixed. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 1.22 million shares. Bulk silver fell back to 4 jiao and 6 fen due to heavy selling pressure. (Wheat) lacked buyers, and long positions slightly sold off and speculators dumped, falling. The news was unremarkable. The market situation tends to continue slightly before there are developments to promote commerce. (Cotton) Buyers were not very enthusiastic. The March position and disappointed long positions continued to sell off, because the market situation could not be maintained without a fall before the acreage reduction legislation. These people felt disappointed. According to reports, Roosevelt is currently working to make all countries jointly reduce acreage. The Dow Jones index is listed below.</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending firmer, and the rising trend is growing, as the stock of yarn in the yarn and cloth warehouse is decreasing day by day. It was found that at its peak last year, there were more than 38,000 bales, but now there are only 17,000 bales. Moreover, cotton prices are still high, and manufacturers are having difficulties. Therefore, some manufacturers are absorbing standard yarn on dips, and although there are no large transactions in actual demand, it is more active than last year. Current sales are coming from sources that can be sustained, and the yarn market is expected to rise. The yarn exchange received a correction to the market announcement, attached here.</p>

<p>Before the market opened, the price of Renbiao (human standard) yarn rose, but due to the downward trend of American cotton, the market sentiment was not good, and the market atmosphere was flat. However, new selling was not strong, and the price rose by 1.30 taels for each month. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were doing well. A certain large merchant had considerable measures for the yarn stored in the warehouse, and a buying spree suddenly arose, with the price rising by 1.224 taels for each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 26,150 bales. It was found that Da Ji sold 950 bales, Zhen Da sold 550 bales, Geng Feng sold 650 bales, Shun Da sold 650 bales, and Yi Chang sold 600 bales. Zhuang Ji bought 950 bales, Geng Feng bought 1,000 bales, Mei Ji bought 750 bales, Da Feng bought 950 bales, and Heng Chang bought 1,500 bales.

<p>The cotton market, which had fallen for two consecutive days, suddenly rebounded, and a rising trend emerged. Although American cotton fell, the exchange rate tended to shrink, and the actual price secretly rose. As a result, those who profited covered their short positions, and the market rebounded. A certain factory also intended to purchase goods this month. However, short sellers viewed the overseas cotton market as weak and continued to sell. The future trend still depends on the movements of overseas cotton.</p>

<p>Tianjin Dispatch. In this city's cotton market, buying and selling transactions have always been handled by cotton warehouses. After merchants unload their goods and deliver them to the cotton warehouses for sale, the warehouses deduct a 1% commission and are responsible for providing merchants with working capital and paying drafts. However, astute cotton warehouse managers can observe the situation and seize the opportunity to buy when the market price drops sharply and merchants are eager to sell. This cannot be done without sufficient capital. There are more than 20 cotton warehouses in this city. The business conditions last year were generally unremarkable. The prosperous periods of the cotton market are in the spring, when the rivers thaw and goods from the production areas flow downstream, and in the autumn, when new goods enter the market and demand shows a period of activity. Upon investigation, the sales in the spring of last year were mediocre, and there was no special interest until the summer. Therefore, the futures prices gradually softened, and some cotton warehouses even engaged in short selling without waiting for merchants to sell their goods. Unexpectedly, the spot market revealed a firm trend, and short positions suffered heavy losses during delivery. Some warehouse merchants who had independently engaged in short selling were inevitably affected by losses. By the end of the lunar year, four or five households had their foundations shaken due to the above reasons. The remaining households saw little activity in exports by East and West foreign firms throughout the year, and their profits were also small. However, most were able to cover their expenses with their earnings.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton weakened due to a lack of major buyers, unfavorable news from Liverpool, and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, spot prices fell by ten pounds, and futures prices fell by thirteen to fifteen pounds. English spot cotton fell by seven points, and futures prices rose or fell by one to four points. Egyptian spot cotton fell by nine points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to profit-taking by bulls, but later rebounded due to short covering, purchases by European exporters, and the appreciation of the US dollar. As a result, Pingor remained unchanged, while Omra and Bairaoshi fell by one rupee and two and a half annas. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 20th):</p>

<h3 id="e276">Foreign Wheat Continues to Be Traded, Standard Flour Auctions Become Softer <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month generally showed a pattern of initial stability followed by weakness. The quoted price of foreign wheat was 0.325 to 0.375 taels lower than Chicago's price. At the beginning, there was still demand for the recently standard wheat in the north, and there were frequent purchases. However, the factories gradually released their chips, and market speculation also followed suit. Therefore, after the second round of trading, the situation gradually weakened. As for foreign wheat, it was reported that the government had sold another shipment of wheat at a low price of 4.10 yuan, which was secured by Fufeng. Therefore, the factory also continued to hedge its position. With the successive transactions of foreign wheat, the imbalance between supply and demand will likely lead to a poor situation in the future. As a result, this month's price was 0.025 taels lower than the previous day, March and April were 0.05 taels lower, May was 0.075 taels lower, June was 0.05 taels lower, and July was 0.1 taels lower.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Futures Wheat Falls Seven or Eight Points <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a pattern of initial stability followed by a sharp decline. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat in the morning was 0.02 to 0.04 taels lower, the market sentiment was still stable, and there were not many sellers, so the trading was very light, with little inflow or outflow. However, after the market opened in the afternoon, it was rumored that the government would continue to sell borrowed wheat at a price as low as 4.10 yuan. Therefore, the bulls released their positions, and this month was approaching delivery, so the bulls had to sell. As a result, the opening price fell repeatedly, eventually reaching 4 yuan. The March price also fell sharply due to heavy selling. As a result, this month's price fell by 0.08 taels compared to the previous day, March fell by 0.07 taels, and July fell by 0.02 taels. The spot wheat market was still stable. New scales have been made in the market, and the price is lower than usual. Kai Yao Bay wheat was 3.40 yuan, and Bengbu wheat was 3.33 yuan, totaling 2,500 bags, which were handled by Fuxin Bufeng.</p>
<h3 id="e278">The Situation in Hexia Rice Market is Quiet and Stable <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The arrival of ships is limited, still only the 14th and 15th, with about 2,000 shi (a unit of volume) of goods. Sales are all perfunctory business. Shops in the city and countryside outwardly appear diligent, but in reality, they are all small-ticket transactions, with only a few. Although there are no obstacles to the sales of rice by guest merchants, the poor market conditions in the guest areas have made them unwilling to purchase more. As a result, the purchases by both the North and South Ocean guilds are only around 1,000 bags. Therefore, the overall market situation is stable. The prices of Changbang (Changshu), Subang (Suzhou), Tongbang (Tongxiang), Nangang (South Port) and other japonica rice, as well as Qingjiao (Green Horn), Songsi (Songjiang and Sishi), Liantang (Lotus Pond) and other late rice, and Du Yangjian (Du Yang Point) and other varieties, are all unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from Hexia were the 25th and 26th. The market for all kinds of goods was very weak. The market shape was that the prices of japonica, sheep, Du, Bu, and Jian were flat and weak. White Yuan, Yuan, Jian Bo Xian (thin indica).</p>
<h3 id="e279">Medium and Lower Grade Guest Indica Rice Falls by Five Points <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for guest indica rice continued to see arrivals, and there was still ample inventory, so the market trended weaker. Medium and lower grade goods were actively sought for sale by all parties, making them particularly weak. The price was reduced by nearly a jiao (1/10 of a yuan). Later, merchants from Quanzhou, Fuzhou and other places in Fujian Province began to purchase, and the market recovered slightly. However, in the end, higher-grade goods could still hold their ground, while medium and lower grades were still about five points lower.</p>
<p>The overall market offered 2,000 bags of late Jiangxi machine-milled rice, 1,392 bags of Hunan machine-milled rice, 500 bags of Wuhu machine-milled rice, 700 bags of Mingguang indica rice, 1,540 bags of various Nanjing brown rice, and 1,000 bags of Wuxi machine-milled indica rice, totaling 7,132 bags. Of these, 3,600 bags went to Quanzhou, and over 3,000 bags went to Fuzhou. The rest was handled by the local market. The market situation is temporarily stable. However, if demand from Fujian Province continues to be strong, the market may turn around. However, with both sources and inventory being ample, it will not be easy to raise prices for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Soybeans Arrive in a Rush, Prices Fall <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of soybeans suddenly fell because there were still few sales at the beginning of the year (it was said that factories would not start purchasing until after the Lantern Festival), and sources continued to arrive. As a result, merchants lowered prices to promote sales. However, as soon as the buyers moved, the overall market opened five or six truckloads of beans from various places, including two truckloads of Zhengyangguan beans, two truckloads of Yingzhou beans, and about one truckload of Feihe beans. The market price of higher-grade goods was 0.07 to 0.08 taels lower than Zhongguan beans, and medium-grade goods were about 0.04 to 0.05 taels lower. In short, sales of higher-grade beans were weaker, while sales of medium-grade goods were slightly better.</p>
<h3 id="e281">The Tung Oil Market Continues to Close Accounts <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>The tung oil market relies heavily on foreign trade. In recent years, the market has been weak for most of the year due to the decline in foreign sales. Local firms have traditionally focused on domestic sales, but due to the collapse of the rural economy and the decline of all industries, tung oil, which is not a daily necessity, has been more severely affected than other industries. However, each firm has a long history and is primarily focused on stability. Therefore, even if there are profits and losses, they are limited, usually around two or three thousand yuan. The assessment of the value of the inventory will naturally vary. It is not surprising. Most firms have not found it easy to make profits in the past year, so eight or nine out of ten reported a flat result. Even if there are one or two profitable firms, their profits are accumulated over time, which is an exception. All firms will continue to operate as usual this year. The scope of this industry is not large, and the business is stable. Although it cannot be particularly brilliant, it will not suffer major losses. All firms opened for business as usual the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e282">The Sugar Market is Sluggish <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Although the sugar market saw a rise in gold prices and a reduction in the Dutch exchange rate, there was still little excitement in the market. No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was sluggish and difficult to sell, falling another 0.05 yuan to 19.80 yuan. The quoted price of Dutch Taikoo red sugar was similar to the previous day, with no transactions. Gao Pianqingchao Gang (High Grade Qingchao brand) offered 50 boxes at a price of 8.70 yuan. The price of white sugar from local factories was affected by the drop in coarse granulated sugar, falling another 0.10 yuan to 18.90 yuan. Ming Qing Bin (Bright Qing Bin) sugar was finally launched yesterday, with an estimated 500 bags offered. The prices were as follows: Tizhuang Qing (Tizhuang Qing) 11.80 yuan, Huanggang Qing (Huanggang Qing) 11.50 yuan to 11.60 yuan, and Ban Nan Qing (Half South Qing) 10.08 yuan to 11.00 yuan to 11.20 yuan. The situation was lackluster.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Silk and Tea: It is Difficult to Expect the Selling Price of Chinese Silk to Rise <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>▲There is No Hope for the Export of Gray Silk. The eight-cocoon gray silk produced in the northeastern provinces is a unique natural product of our country. In recent years, the production of wild silkworm silk in Japan, South Korea, and other countries has increased dramatically, and the sales of artificial silk have encroached upon the market, causing the export of gray silk to plummet. Exports have become exhausted. In the past year (1933), only 1,245 bales were shipped to Europe and the United States. In the year before (1932), 11,475 bales were exported, only about one-tenth of the previous year.</p>
<p>▲It is Difficult to Develop Sales of Foreign Silk Filatures. In the overseas raw silk market, the price of Chinese silk is difficult to rise recently due to the stepped decline and dumping of Japanese silk. Although there were telegrams from New York, Lyon, and other places yesterday morning regarding the trading of yellow and white silk, the prices offered still differed greatly from the cost of Chinese silk, and merchants were unwilling to sell at a loss. Therefore, it is still difficult to develop silk sales. Yesterday, only mainland silk shops purchased 30 bolts of spot white filature silk and 10 bales of Sichuan filature silk. The prices remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Tea Market: The Tea Market Slightly Opens <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>In the foreign tea market, there have been sporadic negotiations yesterday. The Jardine Matheson purchased 86 boxes of local tea and foreign tea. The opening price of Zhenmei (True Eyebrow) tea was 54 yuan, and the sales price of Xiamei (Shrimp Eyebrow) tea was 48 yuan, with no significant rise or fall compared to the end of the previous period.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Silk and Tea Exports Decline <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>China's foreign trade relies heavily on the transportation and sale of silk and tea to Europe and the United States. However, exports have suddenly declined since the previous year, gradually decreasing. Yesterday, the Pindati (transliterated) of the British company exported only 32 tons of tea, and there was a complete absence of Hu Silk (Huzhou Silk). According to the company, this situation has never happened before, indicating the decline of China's silk and tea. The reason for this is said to be the impact of the low price and dumping of Japanese silk.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Wool Herringbone Fabric is All the Rage for a While <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>Merchants in this street have recently started opening accounts to trade in wool fabrics, which are in demand for spring sales. However, most of them are stamped on credit. Wool herringbone fabrics for overcoats are all the rage and sell particularly well. Clothing stores and Western clothing businesses are purchasing them daily. The demand is especially high in Qipan Street and Daxin Street. Warren herringbone overcoat fabric sells for 7.75 yuan per yard for the actual price. Yongle wool herringbone fabric sells for 6.50 yuan. The Friendship China brand sells for 5.25 yuan. Miye Mai Gao (transliterated) goods sell for 4.10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e287">New Angle Iron in the Hardware Market: Sales in Tianjin are Lively <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>Transactions of new angle iron have been developing recently. Although the manufacturers' decorations are ordinary, sales to Tianjin merchants have suddenly become lively. Therefore, the sales volume is much higher than that of British steel plates, new foreign dollars, and other varieties. It is said that the market offered a total of six or seven hundred dan yesterday. The price is estimated at 5.40 yuan per dan, a drop of 0.10 yuan compared to the red market. However, due to the low inventory, the market sentiment is unusually strong. Therefore, for small transactions, the market price still opens at 5.50 yuan, and the credit price for blacksmiths is 6 yuan. It is found that telegrams from overseas are unusually firm. Therefore, there is no downward trend in the market price in this port in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e310">Virtuous Wife and Good Mother <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiong</p>
<p>Because of thousands of years of feudal, patriarchal thought tradition, even now, those who claim to be men of the twentieth century, whether old or young, cannot help but hope that women will restore the old duties of virtuous wives and good mothers as their own responsibility, and not allow them to have great development and effort in society! Hoping to be subordinate to men's control and domination day and night. Based on the selfish nature of human beings, we cannot absolutely deny their reasons, but we are more willing to observe in detail and calmly, and recognize the fact that objective conditions have created the past oppression of women and the sole responsibility of only being able to be virtuous wives and good mothers!</p>
<p>Virtuous wife and good mother is a slogan that oppresses us, and it is also the only step for men to stand on their own interests and think about achieving their ultimate goals! Therefore, we must first know that in the current severe period of historical storms, we do not hope to be a purely virtuous wife, nor do we absolutely be a good mother, and eliminate the happiness and meaning of our entire human race; we must also bear a heavy mission and promote the evolution of society forward!</p>
<p>Looking through the history of social evolution, the various processes of the initial development of mankind each have their own production conditions. At that time, there was no distinction between men and women and classes, let alone the difference between oppressors and oppressed.</p>
<p>Due to the demise of the matrilineal system and the rise of the patrilineal system, the original communal system of surnames was broken, and the result of knowing the growth of the system was a major social revolution brought about by the evolution of production methods, and it was the first major revolution in human history. As a result of this revolution, the important position of women in ethnic societies in the past was completely overthrown. From then on, women were completely subordinate to men and in a position of slavery. 丨丨 This should be considered the first time in women's history that they suffered the status of slaves. However, the control of economic power in the hands of men is not an original fact. As Kuno Fu proved, "In the beginning, during the matrilineal system, the economic power of mankind was completely controlled by women. Women were not only the creators of family industry in primitive times, but also the farmers of primitive times. Family industry occupied an important position in the primitive barter era. The initial division of labor was that women planted gardens and vegetables, while men raised livestock; based on this division of labor, all social order was arranged accordingly. Because of the importance of women in the production position, they also occupied an important position in ethnic societies. This important position cannot be overthrown unless there is a fundamental change in production." … We know that women in the past did not have the qualifications to be exclusively virtuous wives and good mothers, but also had great abilities! The overthrow of maternal power was a major failure in the history of women. Since the beginning of the disintegration of tribal systems, production methods have gradually progressed, and when one person's labor can supply the needs of more than one person, this puts women in a subordinate position 丨丨 that is, the so-called slogan that virtuous wife and good mother is the sole responsibility of women, has arisen from this point on. Since men have acquired control over the people's courts, women have become mere reproductive machines and slaves for men's use. That is, as a result of changes and evolution in production methods, when major industries and products are occupied by men, women lose the opportunity for economic independence. Naturally, due to the needs of such life, in the inevitable process, the general women only had to pitifully succumb to the shackles of men! As a result, women are gradually subordinate to men in all aspects of the economy and society, and have completely become appendages and private playthings of men. At this time, the slogan of virtuous wife and good mother was sung high into the clouds, and all the freedom of the women themselves was sacrificed under the control and destruction of the men, and they did not dare to utter a single whimper! What a heartbreaking thing this is!</p>
<p>Originally, the difference between men and women lies only in physiological differences, and there is not much difference at all! Therefore, the labor of men and women should only be appropriate labor based on the physiology of men and women, and there is no huge difference in importance! Therefore, from now on, we should know that in addition to the above-mentioned responsibilities of a virtuous wife and good mother, we should also know that there are many more careers in society waiting for our women's power to develop and pioneer!</p>

<p>Adding a hand or a tree next to the character "奉" (fèng, to offer) will result in characters with different meanings. Adding a hand turns it into "捧" (pěng, to hold/praise), adding a tree turns it into "棒" (bàng, stick/club). "捧" is a verb, "棒" is a noun. The difference between action and inaction is obvious!</p>
<p>"棒" refers to a wooden stick. However, with the addition and usage of external force, it will also move. The Monkey King in the village uses it to make his students quietly recite "Zhao Qian Sun Li?" As for catching thieves in the middle of the night, dragging a stick in hand is enough to make the thief tremble. Clearly, this "棒" has no connection with people. Everyone shakes their head when they hear about being beaten with a stick!</p>
<p>As for the character "捧", it comes from voluntary action. It may be greatly beneficial to praise others, unlike "棒", which is used by others and only knows how to harm others? Therefore, the character "捧" is particularly welcome. In these years, the most important thing to do is to be well-behaved? Since one does not discuss national affairs, one naturally talks nonsense. Since the "棒" is not welcomed, one has to be agreeable and talk about the universally admired character "捧"?</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, praising comes from voluntary action, but this cannot be generalized. Facts often contradict this. For example, actors often host banquets before going on stage, inviting people who will say good or bad things about their magic? As for the invited people, their mouths have already been stuffed with things! Therefore, according to the theorem "If you take someone's money, you have to help them avoid disaster", they try their best to praise them in the newspapers, even if the art is really terrible. The above belongs to the passive category.</p>
<p>Those who act voluntarily are actually selfish? The driving force is nothing more than benefiting oneself or harming others! When you see a wealthy and powerful person, you might as well flatter them to their face and write an article praising them in the newspaper; or sing their praises. As for those with malicious intent, for example, when a beautiful Kun Opera actor goes on stage, people often cheer and applaud wildly. In fact, they are not admiring the beauty of the art, but want to use this to advance themselves, to get the actor's favor, and to corrupt their mind? All of this belongs to the category of voluntary action.</p>
<p>There are also those who do not want to praise others but need to be praised by others. Officials need people to beat the drums beside them? Only then can fortune come to them. Furthermore, while in office, there must always be people singing their praises in the newspapers, which is of great benefit? As for a certain position that has been determined, and when people are being scouted, that is precisely an insinuation that whoever is praised the most will get the job. Therefore, if you don't want to do it, that's fine, but if you want to do it, you need praisers. In the past, Yuan Shikai dreamed of becoming emperor, and what about ascending the throne and setting a reign title? If no one praised him, he really couldn't bring himself to do it. As for the puppet in the Northeast that we neither recognize nor have wiped out, it is naturally also the work of praising. With Zheng's reverse persuasion, and even those short enemies who do not turn to good thoughts agreeing, naturally their skin has thickened! In short, with "praising", things will naturally become chaotic.</p>

<p>— Xiren</p>
<p>When I came downstairs to answer the phone, my friend smilingly handed me the receiver. This was originally an ordinary matter. I receive countless phone calls every day, and I've never seen him with such a comical expression. So, I couldn't help but ask, "Who is it?" My friend didn't answer; he made another funny face and ran away. Miss, this is what surprised me. The voice on the other end of the line was a woman's. No wonder my friend acted that way. People say I know too little about women, and I really can't get close to them. I don't know how to be humble to women; I don't know how to be gentle in my speech with women... In short, I know too little about women. Yet, I received a phone call from a woman, Miss. If this were six months ago, after hearing the voice, I could have unhesitatingly asked, "Are you ××?" But now I can't. After trying in vain for a long time, it turned out to be you, Miss.</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. It's another New Year, and we've all grown another year older. What do you ask me to do during the New Year? Miss, what can I tell you? If it weren't for bills and demands for payment flying in, I wouldn't even know another year had begun. So, I simply replied, "Nothing!" At this moment, the voice on the phone changed to a man's voice. His manner of speaking was indeed very gentle. After addressing me as Mr. ×, he offered New Year's greetings. Please forgive my rudeness at the time; I didn't say a word of courtesy. Speaking of which, Miss, I didn't come to congratulate you when you got married and ask for a cup of wedding wine. I still don't know how to deal with an unfamiliar man. Saying I know too little about women is only half the story; I know too little about social interactions between people, or rather, the means of what amounts to deception.</p>
<p>Miss, thank you both for thinking of an old friend after returning from your travels in the South. You specially invited me to dinner at the start of the New Year. In principle, I shouldn't decline under any circumstances, but in the past six months, I haven't made any progress. I'm still that kind of man who knows nothing. I feel ashamed to face an old friend, ashamed to face the old friend's companion whom I haven't met! I lied to you, saying that my workplace has a banquet. Of course, the old friend knows me. I clearly heard you say, "He's lying." At the same time, two laughs came through, probably because you were leaning on his shoulder, and your 'he' said many polite things. Ah! I know too little about using deception. You saw through my lie at the first shot, so I didn't even say "Thank you" or "Goodbye" to him because I'm still someone who knows too little about the ways of social interaction. Goodbye then, and Happy New Year!</p>
<h3 id="e313">Who Defends the Shanghai School? <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— A'tan</p>
<p>I wrote an article in the Shanghai local supplement of the Shen Bao, "On Selling Writing for a Living," which elicited an article from Mr. Qingnong. He said: A'tan misunderstood Mr. Shen Congwen's original intention and defended the "Shanghai School," "aiding the wicked." In fact, it wasn't that A'tan misunderstood Mr. Shen Congwen's article; it was that Mr. Qingnong misunderstood A'tan's article. First of all, A'tan doesn't look up to people of the Shanghai School. Therefore, when he saw Mr. Cao Juren's words, "Both the Shanghai School and the Beijing School should be swept away," he felt it was absolutely right. And he agrees with his statement that "Between the two, it is better to be Beijing than Shanghai." Because the Shanghai School has some connection with society, while the Beijing School wants to break away from society (please refer to Mr. Cao's original article). So, it's clear that A'tan doesn't consider "making money" to be a characteristic of the Shanghai School (therefore, he said "the so-called commercial competition includes many things"). A'tan wrote that article "On Selling Writing for a Living" simply because of the association with the four words "commercial competition." (I remember stating that in the original article.) A'tan's article was neither a response to Mr. Shen Congwen nor a defense of the Shanghai School. Therefore, even the "he" mentioned in the "somewhat harsh" statement doesn't refer to Mr. Shen Congwen, but to those who attack others by selling words for money without principles. I don't understand what Mr. Qingnong misunderstood.</p>
<p>Mr. Qingnong repeatedly tells us who the Shanghai School is and what types of Shanghai School there are, for which we can be grateful. Because we can "recognize traitors and attack them." Even A'tan believes that people who are "merchants and thieves" should be attacked. They even sell their personalities. In A'tan's original article, it is repeatedly mentioned whether what is being sold is poison or aphrodisiac, which is extremely clear.</p>
<p>To put it more clearly, the idea of A'tan's article is simply to explain that selling writing is not shameful. The "Beijing School" mocks the "Shanghai School" for having a "commercial competition," but selling writing isn't entirely "Shanghai School," and simply selling writing doesn't constitute "Shanghai School." A'tan used Dostoevsky as an example, but is Dostoevsky a Shanghai School writer?</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Congwen's "commercial competition" is like saying that thieves eat. A'tan's article simply explains that not everyone who eats is a thief; the question is whether they "steal or not." That's all.</p>
<p>Regarding the "merchants and thieves" types, Mr. Qingnong says that those of us who "sell writing for a living" can "only recognize them as "traitors" and attack them." If A'tan were a little more arrogant, he would say that he and those who "sell aphrodisiacs and arsenic," as specially mentioned in A'tan's original article, are no different from those who sell cod liver oil. As for Mr. Qingnong, who hopes that "Shanghai School writers" will create brilliant glory in the literary world, please forgive my further arrogance: "Mr. Qingnong's forgiveness of the 'Shanghai School' is much greater than A'tan's."</p>
<p>There's no question that Shanghai School writers are worthy of attack. Even A'tan advocates sweeping them away, but if the only crime of Shanghai School writers is making money (naturally, not selling their personalities), is that something that lies in A'tan's heart? Naturally, Mr. Shen Congwen and even Mr. Qingnong don't single out making money as the crime of Shanghai School writers, so A'tan's article isn't defending the Shanghai School, of course.</p>
<h3 id="e314">The Beautiful Nanny <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— Aixi</p>
<p>The necessary condition for being a nanny, in theory, is that she can work and be clean. Whether or not she is beautiful doesn't seem to matter. But although that's what people say, the reality is that it doesn't play out that way!</p>
<p>Especially in a glamorous city like Shanghai!</p>
<p>A few months ago, a new neighbor moved into the back building: an old man and a young woman. A few days later, I learned that they were a father-in-law and daughter-in-law, and they got along quite well. Her mother-in-law was a "amah" who had studied abroad, and the son's noble occupation was unknown.</p>
<p>In recent days, the relationship between the father-in-law and daughter-in-law seems to be developing cracks day by day. They are often heard arguing loudly and softly, and they each cook their own meals, quite like "living in the same house but eating separately." Suddenly, the daughter-in-law began to apply rouge and powder every morning, using all sorts of artificial embellishments. Moreover, she couldn't sit still in the house, so she left early and returned late every day—but I don't know what she was doing.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law of the back building, where are you going?" One day, when she was dressed up and preparing to go out, I asked with a smile. "Going to look for business, to help people."</p>
<p>"No wonder I've seen you at home these past few days; you're looking for business!"</p>
<p>"Yes! What's the point of a young person being idle at home?"</p>
<p>"Did you find anything?"</p>
<p>"I had a business the day before yesterday, but because the master wanted to take me with them when they went out, I wasn't happy."</p>
<p>"So you have to find something else?"</p>
<p>"No, yesterday someone introduced me to the mansion at ×× Lane ×× Number: the wife of this family just died, and they want someone to take care of the children; there's even extra money every day!" She said rather proudly.</p>
<p>"Sleeping over?"</p>
<p>"Not coming back. Sleeping in the same room as the young master, but on two beds. I sleep with the children. The young master said: the nanny has to be beautiful and clean. I'm going to see his house today—I guess it should be suitable!"</p>
<p>She walked away smiling and speaking, full of the joys of spring.</p>
<p>It wasn't even two hours later. She came back to move her bedding. Outside stood a man holding a child, naturally indicating that the business had been successful. However, just as she was taking the bedding out the door, she turned her head and glared at the back building, cursing fiercely, "You old geezer..."</p>
<p>"Let's go! Amah!" She suddenly heard the man holding the child outside calling out, and she immediately, in the laughter of "Coming! Coming! Young master!" twisted her body, putting on a "smile that launches a thousand charms"!</p>
<p>"Nannies need to be beautiful too; so that's how it is!" That thought was deeply imprinted in my mind.</p>

<h3 id="e315">A Mao's New Clothes <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— Yier</p>
<p>It really was a great stroke of luck. A Mao, who usually wore patched and ragged shirts and trousers, actually got a new set of clothes made at the end of the year, ready to compete for some face in the New Year.</p>
<p>She had gone several years without new clothes for the New Year. Like the year before last, although her mother had firmly promised to make her a set, it ultimately didn't happen because her father, one day while pushing a wheelbarrow on the road, was knocked over by a motorcycle cart and was fined a dollar by the police, which affected the planned new clothes.</p>
<p>After this New Year, she would be just nine years old. Children don't really understand how to be fashionable, but she always felt that not having new clothes to wear for the New Year was a shameful fact.</p>
<p>I remember that the year before last, because she was still wearing that worn-out outfit on New Year's Day, she was ridiculed by many girls she played with, which made her very frustrated. So, from that time on, she made a grand wish that, no matter what, she would always try her best to negotiate with her parents to make her a new set of clothes to avenge her long-held resentment.</p>
<p>Sure enough, this time the goal was achieved. A set of new clothes made of green-striped foreign cloth, bought for nine dimes and two cents, was finally made by her mother, who secretly worked four nights under the lamp. Although her mother's needlework wasn't necessarily that good, the finished product fit quite well. When A Mao was asked to try it on, her father praised it for being very fitting, and she jumped up and down, as happy as could be.</p>
<p>So, she said to her father and mother:</p>
<p>"I'm so happy, I have new clothes to wear for the New Year!"</p>
<p>The father smiled; the mother replied:</p>
<p>"A Mao! Good, no need to have a long face on the first day of the New Year! But you have to cherish them and not get them dirty! After the Lantern Festival, you must change them. Wear them again on festival days or when watching lively events!"</p>
<p>Because of these new clothes, A Mao looked forward to the New Year coming sooner every day. It was only with great difficulty that she got to the end of the year. That night, she and her parents had their New Year's Eve dinner. Her father gave her twelve copper coins as New Year's money and instructed her:</p>
<p>"A Mao, go to sleep quickly at night, so you can get up early tomorrow to go out and play."</p>
<p>"Dad, okay, get up early tomorrow to go out and play!" She imitated her father's words, and then turned her head: "Mom, wake me up at five o'clock tomorrow morning, I want to get up and wear my new clothes to wish Dad and Mom a happy New Year."</p>
<p>On the morning of the first day of the New Year, a burst of firecrackers rang out, and A Mao woke up on her own without her mother calling her. At the moment she just opened her eyes, she lay alone in the quilt, savoring the dream she had that night.</p>
<p>She dreamed of wearing that newly made green-striped foreign cloth short shirt and trousers, and going to play with many familiar children in an open space. She also brought some snacks and ate them very happily. Moreover, all the playmates praised her new clothes, saying they were very beautiful. She felt that this was the most glorious day of her life, and therefore became proud.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she couldn't help but smile, and then shook her mother, who was sleeping beside her, shouting that she wanted to get her new clothes to wear. At this time, her mother was awakened by her. She coughed, then turned over and stroked her daughter's fine hair with her hand, coaxing her lovingly:</p>
<p>"A Mao, are you awake? It's still early. I'll tell you, last night when Dad went to sleep, he told me to tell A Mao when she woke up tomorrow that she didn't need to wear her new clothes. There's no great point in wearing new clothes for the New Year. We plan to go to your uncle's house for the Lantern Festival, and it will be good to wear them then, so it's a little more fresh. When your uncle sees them, he will be even happier!"</p>
<p>"No, no! I want to wear them today!" Her eyes widened, and she shouted anxiously.</p>
<p>"Good A Mao, be good and listen to Mom! The black cloth shirt you wore for the Mid-Autumn Festival is also ready. I washed it clean for you the day before yesterday."</p>
<p>"Who wants to wear that one? That one has patches on the front and sleeves! I don't want it, I must wear my new clothes! If I don't have new clothes to wear for the New Year, people will bully me!" A Mao was almost crying, saying it with her upper and lower lips tightly closed.</p>
<p>The father also woke up, and also comforted her gently: "Good child, listen to Mom, or it will be good to wear them on the ninth day, the ninth day is the Jade Emperor's birthday."</p>
<p>"No, wear them today, wear them on the ninth day too, and wear them to my uncle's house too!" A Mao said stubbornly.</p>
<p>After several attempts to coax her, she still wouldn't give in. In great distress, the father finally became angry and slapped her twice in the face. The reaction, of course, was A Mao's crying. In the end, thanks to the mother's many kind words to persuade her, and giving her some pocket money, she was tricked into staying put.</p>
<p>After breakfast, A Mao had no choice but to put on that old black cloth shirt and slipped outside to play. The couple stayed at home, sitting there in between them. The mother suddenly sighed and said:</p>
<p>"Poor people are just destined to have no luck. They can't even let her wear a set of new clothes that have been made out to meet people properly. It's enough to coax her, what does a child know, why did you hit her!"</p>
<p>"Where did I really want to hit her? But I felt too sad, so I couldn't help but get angry; sigh!"</p>
<p>"The rice shop owner wouldn't budge, I told you to just take this quilt, but you insisted on those new clothes." The mother said with red eyes.</p>
<p>"The quilt! It's so cold, without this quilt, I'm afraid we'll freeze to death... And the Chen family next door owes two oceans, I begged bitterly, and they finally agreed to postpone it to the middle of the month." The father said with infinite sadness.</p>
<p>While the couple were coughing and sighing, A Mao suddenly came crying in from outside the door, intermittently sobbing: "Mom! Give me my new clothes to wear! People are bullying me again. They said I look like a beggar. Those new clothes weren't bought with Dad's money, they were bought with the four two-dime bills Mom picked up in a garbage dump in an alley the day before yesterday, why won't you let me wear them!"</p>
<p>Their hearts felt like they were being stabbed with needles. They couldn't find a word to comfort her. They could only see tears streaming down their faces like a spring of water!</p>

<p>"Fifth Master Zhou, don't pay; just take it." Xu San stood up from the dirt floor.</p>
<p>"Take it. Good stuff." Zhou Chunrong gave him the money and lay down on the bed, taking Mr. Cao's cigarette.</p>
<p>After receiving the money, Xu San couldn't find the lantern he wanted in the corner of the room, so he shrunk his head and went out. A cold air rushed onto his face again. In the pitch-black sky, the faint wind was blowing, and a surge of heat moved in his heart. A group of peddlers passed him, carrying burdens, their feet in straw sandals stepping heavily in the bone-chilling mud, making a "chatter, chatter" sound. Ahead, there was someone carrying a glass lantern. He followed the light for a while, turned into a dark alley, and soon arrived at his own home.</p>
<p>Gently, gently, he pushed open the door of his house. It was dark inside. He familiarly walked inside.</p>
<p>Before he reached his own room, a woman's voice came from the room, asking,</p>
<p>"Who is it?" The question was issued after a laugh.</p>
<p>"Me." The answer was dry, familiar.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" The question was immediately passed out, as if asking a stranger.</p>
<p>"Getting cigarettes." Xu San understood that there was a guest smoking in the room, so he slowed down his pace.</p>
<p>"I'll bring them to you."</p>
<p>So Xu San stopped. The drawer in the room rang slightly, and then he heard the question: "How much money is it?" After getting the answer, after a while, his wife, Third Sister, came out of the room with a lamp, and the dark outer room suddenly became bright.</p>
<p>The lamplight shone on about half of her thirty-year-old face, which had the enchanting beauty of a woman who was getting old, but she glanced at her husband with extreme coldness. The side silhouette was reflected on the wall, the back of the silhouette on the wall was her hair, and the silhouette swayed slightly. "Who is it?" Xu San asked his wife in a low voice, taking the cigarette pack.</p>
<p>The silhouette's lips also moved, in an extremely low voice. "Wang Chaofeng of Hu Yitai's."</p>
<p>The husband turned and walked away. She called out "Don't forget to flick the ash," and after the husband hummed and walked out, she closed the door tightly, inspected outside the room, and then returned to the room.</p>
<p>She put the lamp on the table, turned down the flame a little, poured tea for Mr. Wang, placed the teacup steadily on the smoking tray, and sat in front of Wang Chaofeng's angled knees. The man propped up his slightly leaning body with his left hand, and his right hand reached up from behind her, under her clothes. Third Sister leaned on him in the situation. A playful laughter started in the yellow light.</p>
<p>She stood up and lay down again in her original position on the opposite side. Both pairs of eyes were looking at the flame inside the round-mouthed glass cover, as if the dim interest of this small flame was more interesting than the movies in the city.</p>
<p>The man smoked, speaking at the same time; all the movements were unhurried, and the black, small particles that were swelling up on the smoke skewer were turning on his left index finger very deftly and skillfully. The woman continued the previous topic, telling the story of her quarrel with another woman; this was something women could never finish talking about; she told it with relish. She glanced at the man and said,</p>

<p>"There are really too many of these kinds of women in Hollywood. When they can't get in through the front door, they try to stick to a star, preparing to file an abandonment lawsuit in the future, which can at least give them publicity, as a shortcut to entering the film industry. Sometimes, this plan actually succeeds, so the rest all follow suit, leading to the current situation, where no man in Hollywood can be said to have security.</p>
<p>"There are really too many kinds of women's tricks. The most common is the mother-daughter combo. For example, you live in an apartment, and suddenly one day, a new neighbor moves in next door: a very amiable middle-aged woman, with a girl. That girl, seeing you, will definitely say, "Oh, this is great, to be able to live in the same house as a big star." Her innocent look will make you not suspect her of having any ambitions. You might invite them over for tea, or take them to visit the studio, or even introduce the girl to the company. If she can make it, that would be great. But if she doesn't succeed, then her mother will speak up. You quickly think of a way for her; otherwise, she will slander you, accusing you of some crime. At that time, the most common method is to take out your checkbook and write a check. There are too many of these kinds of mothers in Hollywood. She's in the back, arranging and directing everything, making it impossible for you to defend against or escape.</p>
<p>"Everyone thinks that the phone numbers of big stars are absolutely secret, but clever women will always find a way to find them out. Or one day, you receive a phone call, the other person is a woman, she says she was introduced by so-and-so. At that time, you have no way to verify it, you can only vaguely agree to her request and meet her. She comes, and you may find that what so-and-so said was a fabrication, but she claims to be a fan who admires you, so you don't want to offend her. Or you think she's very clever, very interesting... They are almost all clever and interesting young women... Then you feel it's okay to deal with her. Slowly, she gradually reveals her intentions, wanting to demand fur coats, jewelry, and other things from you. If you don't agree, she will turn against you and bite you; if you agree to her, then there's no way to fill her insatiable desires, so you're in a dilemma. "Once, it was extremely dangerous. I was shooting a scene in the studio, and a woman was standing next to me, holding a notebook and pencil in her arms. She said she wanted to talk to me. I thought she was a reporter, so I agreed. When the scene was finished, I told her to wait ten minutes, preparing to go and remove my makeup. Unexpectedly, as soon as I entered the dressing room, she followed me in. She said she was used to seeing people in the theater and film industry, so it didn't matter to see me changing clothes. Believing her words, I took off my costume in front of her. Unexpectedly, taking me by surprise, she also took off all her clothes. I don't know what her good intentions were, but it took a lot of effort to persuade her to leave. From then on, my dressing room was locked whenever I went in or out. Do you think I'm afraid of women or not? "After talking for so long, what's the solution? The answer is very difficult, the reason is that ordinary people are too easily deceived by propaganda and doubt the character of movie stars. The saying "Where there's smoke, there's fire" doesn't apply here. Many breach of promise lawsuits in Hollywood are completely groundless. Of course, justice can be obtained in court, but people in society don't wait for the court's judgment, but are lightly influenced by propaganda. Therefore, general movie stars don't dare to give up their careers and prospects to go to court, because even if they win the lawsuit in the future, their reputation has been stained, and their future may be dimmed because of it. After calculating, it's best to swallow their anger, spend some money unjustly, and settle it privately. But the crime of extortion and intimidation grows because of this, and general male stars regard associating with women as a fearful path." (End)</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e319">Review of "The Road to Light" <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Si</p>
<p>In today's society, two typical lifestyles are prevalent: one is wealthy, with no worries about clothing, food, or housing, and a happy family; the other is impoverished, suffering from hunger and cold, with no place to settle, and a family that not only lacks happiness but may even be torn apart. An artistic work that can capture such typical realities and portray them will undoubtedly leave a deep impression. The author of "The Road to Light" used the realistic event of Chen Tai's economic oppression, which led to the death of his wife and the scattering of his children, as the subject matter. This effort is commendable. However, after grasping such a real subject, the author did not treat it in a consistently realistic manner, losing the serious and conscientious attitude that such a subject deserved. The author considered trivial interests and added unnecessary and unrealistic interludes, such as having Chen Tai sell medicine as a gimmick. This not only lacks sufficient realism but also gives the entire play a sense of "inappropriateness" in its development and presentation, given the central theme. However, the author's juxtaposition of the singing and feasting in the wealthy family's home with Chen Tai's home has considerable power in expressing the film's theme, although it is a bit overdone.</p>
<p>There are also some very coincidental interludes. These accidental events also weaken the development, expression, power, and tension of the entire play. For example, Chen Tai's accidental finding of a newspaper in the park to look for a job does not seem to forcefully express his fear of unemployment. Of course, I am not saying that Chen Tai should not read the newspaper to look for a job; on the contrary, Chen Tai should intentionally look for newspapers, wouldn't that be more tense and powerful than the accidental finding of a newspaper?</p>
<p>In addition, Chen Tai and the unemployed workers competing to confess at the Public Security Bureau (?), and going to the Northwest to reclaim land, all lack sufficient realism. This does not inject much power into the overall development and presentation of the film; especially the ending of going to the Northwest to reclaim land seems even more forced. Furthermore, turning unemployed workers into thieves cannot be considered a moving stroke; it is not to say that unemployed workers in today's society never resort to theft, but this situation is ultimately not common. Grasping special, i.e., atypical, events or characters to express them is very problematic in terms of effect.</p>
<p>In short, because the author did not deal with the adopted subject head-on and realistically express the theme, this film cannot be a very powerful, successful, and complete work.</p>
<p>However, the director's directing techniques and the actors' performances are quite successful, which gives the film considerable power. In particular, Zheng Junli's and Tan Ying's (Tan Ying's makeup is too young) performances, using a slow tempo to portray their characters, are the most suitable and powerful techniques. However, when Zheng Junli unexpectedly returns, Tan Ying should not slam the door shut twice; she should hesitate and slowly close the door to coordinate with Zheng Junli's tempo. This would avoid showing disharmony. There are many examples of this. This shows the director's considerable responsibility. Also, Zheng Junli's makeup seems like stage makeup. Makeup on the silver screen cannot be so rough; it needs to be much more refined than stage makeup so that it does not show on the screen.</p>
<p>However, the point must be reiterated. Although this film distorts reality to the greatest extent in the end, the author's original intention would never have been so. Moreover, we have proven in various ways that the original author made Chen Tai realize that the anti-imperialist war was their proper "way out," but due to certain circumstances, he proposed the slogan of going to the Northwest.</p>
<h3 id="e320">Review of "The Queen of the Cattle Ranch" <a href="#e320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiong</p>

<p>American Western films are flooding the Chinese film market like a tide, which makes Chinese audiences very familiar with them. I think they must have a deep understanding of Western films themselves. At the same time, in the field of film criticism, the social basis of Western films has been pointed out countless times.</p>
<p>However, among a series of similar films, "The Queen of the Cattle Ranch" is the most blatant. It clearly and boldly depicts the cruelty and barbarity of white people invading the indigenous people. The white people plunder the indigenous people's cattle hides in droves, and when they encounter the resistance of the indigenous people, they use the latest weapons to slaughter them miserably. After watching it, can't we prove the author's intention here? Isn't it enough to explain the political significance of so-called martial arts films?</p>
<p>Of course, any kind of American film will not lack the interweaving of women and love. Here, if we are not careful, we will inevitably only see the heroic and mighty image of heroes robbing women. However, no matter how many times the indigenous people are plundered, and no matter how many times there are major conflicts in the end, we will not overlook this important theme, right?</p>
<p>In terms of performance, perhaps we will be overwhelmed by the constant riding and shooting, and the constant tense scenes. Naturally, this is not just a matter of good or bad technique. If we are willing to not ignore the close unity of content and form, and if we absolutely believe that form is the expression of content, then the success of this technique fully illustrates the greatest harm of the content.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say that Chinese audiences are not necessarily harmed by it, and can only watch the magic of riding and shooting, because we have no indigenous people to invade. However, won't the concept of invasion exist in their hearts? Readers, please think about it again and again.</p>
<h3 id="e321">Review of "Kongo" (African Kongo) <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Kongo 丨 Screening in Shanghai 丨</p>
<p>After watching this film, I felt a deep chill. After watching it, this is a true portrayal of the character of civilized people. Slaughter, cruel atrocities. Is this the nature of mankind? Only so-called civilized people would do this.</p>
<p>Here, the author fully describes the deceit, selfishness, hypocrisy, and cruelty of civilized people. Although he cleverly explains that the protagonist took extremely cruel revenge measures because he had been bullied by people. He seduces the enemy's daughter, he detains the doctor. Perhaps the author regrets the protagonist's personality disorder. However, he is ultimately cruel, and his nature is selfish. When he discovers that the enemy's daughter is his own flesh and blood, he finally releases her. Here, of course, there is another effect, which is the American film author's consistent emphasis on love. Because she already has a lover, and her lover is so infatuated with her, this cruel civilized man grants her happiness without any hesitation. Naturally, this woman is fortunately his own daughter. If she were ultimately the enemy's daughter, would he also preserve her life for the sake of her love?</p>
<p>Apart from this, let's look again. Wasn't the protagonist very cleverly conquering that group of savages in Africa? And wasn't that group of indigenous people completely subdued by authority? Okay, this explains that the white civilized people are the masters of the world, and the indigenous people are always slaves like cattle and horses. Thus, the conquered submit to their masters, and civilization is the god of the world. However, what is even more despicable is the exaggeration of so-called virtue. This masking of the truth of barbaric behavior has become the most self-satisfied aspect of civilized people. However, in the end, the protagonist frankly says: "This is where my authority lies, my command is law." Isn't this an exposure of the truth?</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think that this is not a true record, perhaps they think that there is no such country in reality, but aren't the cruel imperialists the rulers of five-sixths of the world? Especially we Chinese people are not subdued by the violence of the powerful, and even feel suffocated when breathing? And haven't we already heard the cries of resistance from slaves all over the world?丨 This is a microcosm.</p>
<p>Besides, what else do I want to say? The director cleverly showed the majesty of the brutal person, and the protagonist, Houston, also fully expressed that terrible character, making us tremble. After watching this film, can we still laugh? In my mind, I often retain the terrifying image of those demons.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3 id="e322">Queen Christina (10) (2) <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Chen</p>
<p>Oxenstierna reminded him from the side: "Doesn't Your Excellency have a handwritten letter from your country's king?" Antonio still couldn't speak, only gestured to his attendants with his hand. The attendant then presented a large envelope, tied with ribbon on the outside, and sealed with a large wax seal, to Prime Minister Oxenstierna, who then presented it to the Queen. Antonio then opened his mouth and said: "Your Majesty, I am a special envoy sent by my country's king. I have important matters related to both countries to report to Your Majesty, and I hope Your Majesty will listen." The Queen handed the large envelope to Oxenstierna and said to the Spanish ambassador: "We will meet again in the inner court soon, and we will talk about it then. For now, please rest assured that our country has great respect for your monarch and the special envoy of your monarch, and we will treat you with as much courtesy as possible." The formal audience thus came to an end. Antonio bowed and thanked, and also withdrew. Christina stood still and watched him leave. The cunning Magnus understood everything after seeing that scene. But Christina still didn't feel anything.</p>
<p>Christina waited quietly for Antonio to come to the inner private chamber for a meeting. Attendants ran in one by one, arranging many foods such as wine and fruit. In the outer chamber, there was also a band playing delicate music. Ebba walked in. She told Christina that the Minister of Finance was requesting an audience. Christina refused to see him, but Ebba tried to persuade her. However, Christina was very firm, and Ebba could only report back to Magnus with fear and trepidation. Magnus was inevitably resentful in his heart because Christina refused to see him. He lingered there, waiting for the Spanish ambassador to arrive. Once the Spanish ambassador arrived, he stepped forward and pretended to greet him very politely. He intentionally or unintentionally talked about the weather in Sweden. He said: "Our country's weather is only bearable for those who are used to it, and is very unsuitable for foreigners, so I advise Your Excellency to be careful and protect yourself." Antonio said: "Are Your Excellency's words a threat?" Magnus said with a sneer: "This is advice." His voice was like a cold wind, piercing straight into Antonio's heart. However, Ebba had already run out from the inner chamber to invite him in, so he didn't say anything, bowed to Magnus, and followed Ebba in.</p>
<p>What made Christina feel very disappointed was that Antonio's meeting in the private chamber was still restrained and extremely formal. Every time Christina wanted to get close to him, to return to the previous situation, he would block her with extremely short language. He said to Christina: "My country's king has long heard of Your Majesty's virtue, and has specially sent me here to pay my respects, to communicate our feelings, and to wish to form a marital alliance with Your Majesty." This shocked Christina, because although Prime Minister Oxenstierna had told her about it, she always thought that this time the Spanish King sent a special envoy here was probably to revise the treaty, or about matters of art, and never expected that he was coming to propose marriage to her. She asked Antonio: "Is this your mission?" Antonio said: "My country's king, with the utmost sincerity and respect, has ordered me to come here to propose marriage, and I must ask Your Majesty to consider and accept." Christina let out a very miserable sound and said: "Why do you treat me so harshly?" Antonio said: "I am in the position of an envoy, and I am here on the orders of my monarch. I dare not be harsh, nor dare I harbor any private opinions." Christina said: "Are we going to pretend from now on that there is no relationship between us?" (To be continued)</p>
