<h3 id="c16">日本外交策略與海軍談話 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>日内瓦軍縮會議延期之後。世界人士關懷於軍縮問题者。乃集中其注意力於英美日三國之海軍會談。美代表台維斯於本月十六日由巴黎起程赴倫敦。參加海軍會議之預備談判。此次會談之具體内容。目前尙難確實明瞭。惟日本則早有凖備。聞其於海軍會談席上提出之主張。第一要求各國低减噸數。縮少艦艇。第二打破已往比率主義。第三確保國防自主權。第四確立軍備平等原則。茲四點歸納之。又可分爲兩項。一則要求英美兩大海軍國减低噸數。縮少艦艇。二則確立日本之所謂軍備平等原則。</p>
<p>日本獨覇東洋之雄心。自九一八事變後。愈見積極。復審知英美二國。無論在經濟上或軍事實力上。對於遠東皆有不能分割之關係。然又莫不遠隔重洋。一旦有事於遠東。非有現時二倍以上之兵力。不能得到戰爭之勝利。卽令英美切實聯合。至多亦僅能保持現狀而止。况近來英美對立。日本又脫離國聯。乃亟圖乘此機會。起而謀操縱太平洋之覇權。并伸長其勢力於赤道以南及香港以西。故其高唱縮小各國現有海軍噸數及减少艦艇之用意。無非在削小英美之攻擊實力。蓋英之新嘉坡。美之珍珠港。距離日本海軍根據地。均在三千浬以上。設無巨大艦艇。持萬浬遠洋之續航力。皆不足與日本海軍决最後之勝負也。</p>
<p>假若日本之上述主張而爲英美所拒絶。則日本將退就其次。復有所謂海軍軍備平等之要求者在。此一提議之眞義。在消極方面。因條約限制。可以削弱英美現有之海軍實力。卽就地理關係論。菲利濱旣於不久之將來宣告獨立。則佐世保要港之威脅。已去其大半。此外雖有香港爲英國海軍之前衛。關島爲美國空軍之根據地。而以與英美並駕齊驅之日本海軍力。自足摧毁此區區彈丸地而有餘。故海軍軍備平等原則一旦成立。則日本海軍實力。便可相形而加强。届時英國海軍將不能越新嘉坡而北。美國海軍不能經夏威夷而西矣。</p>
<p>英美兩國。果能和衷共濟者。尙足聯合以對日。無如兩國之間。暗鬥甚爲激烈。如在南美則有投資關係之衝突。在本身則有戰債問題之齟齬。日本利用此種弱點。乃抛棄其素常排美之舆讑。一則標榜廣田之所謂道義外交。成立赫爾廣田之文書交換。二則派近衛文磨赴美。多方疏解。以表明心跡。三則提示（滿洲）門户開放。以爲厚餌。一方對美。冀惡感之减輕。一方對英。則戒備加嚴。英國之亞洲政策。首在穏定印度之經濟與政治關係。而對華之發展次之。大戰而後。英人此種意圖。尤爲顯著。其顧忌最深者。厥爲防制蘇聯之東進。保持遠東市塲之現狀。然英國僅能扼守印度。而不克控制遠東全局。卽足予日本以挾制之機會。英人知其然。故於海軍預備會談之前。不得不處處遷就日本。以示好意。英美日三國之關係。固如是也。</p>
<p>日本欲挾其離間之策。使英美合作。變成纸上空談。然英美皆爲世界資本主義之巨擘。各以開拓市塲爲急務。而海軍優勢之確保。又爲開拓市塲所必需。豈有不遠慮及此。以此推論。海軍竸賽之活劇。終不免重演於今後。而况九一八事變後。遠東均勢。早經破壞。欲圖調整。糾紛又必叢生。識者謂三國海軍會議前途之黯淡。初不下於日内瓦之軍縮會議。豈無故哉。</p>

<p>次由市黨部代表童行白演說、略謂、關於衛生之實行、實無個人與公共衛生之分因個人爲大衆之一份子、個人不能脫離大衆而生活、社會上彼此之關係極爲密切、一人足以影響全社會、决無某個人在社會上獨立之理、倘個人有不衛生之事實卽足以妨害大衆故必大衆皆衛生、大衆皆健康、然後整個　會受福、大家有切勿以爲衛生運動是小事、其關係國家民族者實非淺鮮、我國民族地位低落人民不健康、不衛生、實爲主要原因、在今日世界生存竸爭之中、倘無健全國民、卽談不上優美文化、所以衛生運動就是救國運動、若以爲衛生運動不過是解决霑小蚊蟲　　垃圾吐痰等問題而已、此猶見其小而未見其大云、</p>

<p>公共租界工部局情報處發表消息云、工部局現巳决定、自明年一月一日起、所有人力車車租定爲最多不得過小洋八角、計較現行租金、每天約减少小洋六角、同時爲便於實行起見、定於本年八月一日起、先將車租改爲小洋十角、俾車主之營業上、便於適應、而可完全遵行工部局之條件、</p>
<p>工部局又採納人力車管理處之建議、擬創辦一車夫互濟會、該會經濟、將使其獨立、但亦可接受捐欵、開辦之始、由工部局派董事三人、（均義務職）監管會欵、此三人大約卽派現在之管理處委員先行担任、以後工部局得任便改派、董事之下、設一執行委員會、（亦係義務職）由董事推舉、熱心社會事業者任之、執行委員担任辦理會務、</p>
<p>互濟會之會員、以領有執照之公用人力車車夫爲限、一俟會務能自力進行時、當由車夫會員選出代表、加入執行委員會、</p>
<p>互濟會會務之大綱、一·辦理免費醫務、（診治及看護）或由會自辦診所、或暫委託巳有之醫院代辦、由會付費、二·設立浴所、三·設立免費宿舍、或只收低廉之租金、四·爲會員及其子女辦理敎育、五·開辦合作商店、六·籌辦電影等項之娱樂、七·辦理演講、講說關於會員福利及車務等項、八·其他應辦之事、隨時酌定之、</p>
<p>互濟會之經費、擬就人力車、每一班徵收小洋半角、此數由車主在工部局規定之車租外附帶徵收、車主經允許徵收此欵後、每月每車交大洋一元五角於互濟會、凡車主請續領車照時、必須有此項交費之收據、工部局對於允爲合作之車主、於給照時、得優先待遇、此項附徵之費、卽自車租减爲十角小洋時實行、</p>
<p>互濟會之初步工作、卽爲恊助車夫、俾可領得拉車執照、此外在開辦時、會欵或可更充其他有益用途、凡會欵純爲車夫福利之需、概不移作他用、</p>
<p>此項計畫實行後、卽自本年八月一日起、車夫每日付車租小洋十角、加附捐小洋一角、共計十一角、卽較現行之十四角、巳减少三角之担負同時車夫更可得互濟會之一切利益、</p>
<p>關於車夫領照一節、工部局先巳决定、令車主就每一領照之車、推舉車夫四名、但車夫之獨立、須完全保持、亦應許其自向工部局請求領照、惟因車主須將其財産交託車夫、且爲使　　拉車之人大多數仍得領照起見、故選擇車夫之事、宜任車主參加意見、現决定折衷辦理、令車主每車舉薦三名、其餘一萬名、則另任車夫自行請領執照、</p>
<p>管理處之意、擬在新閘及虹口兩處、各設一車夫領照所、一俟房屋修改後、卽行開辦、先辦理自用車車夫領照、管理處　於最近期内、在便和於車夫之地點、獲得廉價之地皮、以便建築互濟會房屋、</p>
<p>當本月十五日、管理處曾向某大車主當面解釋互濟會之計畫、管理處之意如果可能、甚願與車主公會善意合作、以便實現改革、本意欲再與其他大車主數大會談後、再公布互濟會之計畫、不幸當日懇談之结果、乃竟有車主會議之召集、而在會議中、附徵捐欵一事、被斥爲違反車夫利益、並指爲欲用以充管理處之經費、觀於現今之說明、可見指斥之無根、惟是在當日會談之時、該車主且曾極力表示贊成互濟會之計畫、且就渠個人之事業論、極表示願與管理處合作、以觀其成也、</p>
<p>又訊、工部局人力車務委員會、因急進工作、所定改換車樣、徵收車夫救濟費、及發給車主領照證等手續、頗引起車商車夫之不滿、目前特區全體車主一千餘人假座市商會、開緊急大會决議、否認工部局人力車務委員會一切建議及設施在案、昨日下午三時、車主大會主席殷芝齡·謁見工部局總辦鍾　、報告車主大會、對於工部局人力車務委員會一切設施、不滿情形、當承鍾恩表示、對人力車務委員會、一切建議、雖經局方同意、但爲體恤車商不可能之事實起見、業巳修正不日公布、决議使車夫救濟會獨立、不由人力車務委員會主持、准由社會熱心名士、參加互商合作、所收救濟費、亦不得充人力車務委員會開支、所有改良車樣、亦當酌量情形、需要改進、逐漸更換、車商方面、可勿慮立時更換車樣之說、至車務章程、雖有修正、但大體與舊章、無甚更改、希代轉咨各車商、安心營業、勿聽　言等云、殷於卽晚報告特區車商公會各理事、及特别委員商討之、</p>
<p>又該車夫救濟基金委員會、昨夜假靑年會開會推曹雲祥往見人力車委員會、接洽救濟車夫情形等情、</p>

<h3 id="c192">怎樣學寫書信文　丨答蔣子玉君丨 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>以前我們常常說，我們無論學習什麽都應當不與實際生活分開、因爲這可以增加學習的興趣、並使所學的東西不致不合實用。</p>
<p>這種意見近來頗得了一般讀者的同意。就以學習文字　術的問題與我們商討的讀者來說。他們以前與我們討論的是學習論文，小品文，小說，詩歌，戲劇等，他們練習寫作的辦法，是任意擬兩题目來做，和學校裏敎師令學生作文一樣，目的完全是練習文字技術，後來他們巳感覺到走這種路是不切實際的，因爲自己的普通日用文字的應還用不夠，馬上就谈創作是脫離了生活的實踐，不能成功的。倒不如在日常生活中天天可用到的書信和日記，先來練習，以後再談寫長篇的東西不遲。因爲寫信一面是當作練習，一面卽是在應際上應用。這種學習文字向着這種方向走當然是最實際的。但同時又發生了新的問題了。但他們不知道應該採取作爲練習的範本是什麽？關於日記的寫法我們巳經討論過了，現在我們就說書信文應該怎樣寫法罷！</p>
<p>依據讀者作爲書信文的範本所開示給我們的書籍來看，大致可分爲兩類：一是古典尺牘，如小倉山房尺牘，秋水軒尺牘，雪鴻軒尺牘等；一是最流行的庸俗的尺牘，如分類尺牘大觀；交際全書，酬世錦　之類，文言尺牘的派别不止這兩類，但讀者大多數却祇選此二種，這不是偶然的。我國舊式尺牘原可分爲三種體裁。一種是晋人小簡，詩人墨客寫信大半都用這種文體，這種尺牘必須要有瀟洒脫俗，淸秀間適的氣味，否則，就不成東西了。這種東西不易學，所以流行只在（士）人中。最近坊間翻印極廣的標點鉛字本（蘇黃尺牘）就屬於這一類。這種尺牘旣以（風雅）爲主，自然我們這班俗人是不宜仰攀的了。第二種是駢體尺牘，在從前官塲中最爲風行的師爺體，差不多下屬對於上司，寫信都用這種體裁，因爲這種信，祇要寫得辭藻　富，堆砌得當，對偶工整，聲調鏗鏘，就是上品，内容空泛是儘可不管的。上司本無可（恭維），但事實上却非此不行，無可奈何，祇有用這種爛調了。現在官塲中旣不大流行，我們又不要爲人寫（捐啓）（徵文啓），所以現在學的人也絶少。最末了一種是古文尺牘，卽用散文來寫，這種信札，崇尙古文的學者的通訊，都還採用，但一般人却很少用它了。這三種書信文，要學習是很要化費許多工夫的，並且現在因爲離我們的實際生活太遠了。古典尺牘是以封建社會士大夫的社交的存在爲其基礎的。他們閑適的生涯，使他們夾賣弄詞藻，在他們的時代是風雅的事，如果我們再來東施效顰，那就是玩物喪志了。</p>
<p>卽令在古文體寫的尺牘中也不免有些内容充實的作品，但我們却仍不贊成讀者們拿它去當作練習寫信的範本，更不希望讀者們採用這種體裁。這理由與我們現在不必用文言而必用白話是　樣的。書信文較之其他文章的優點，就是它能更眞實地表露出作者個人的性情，思想，風趣。做别的文章多少總不免有點做作，書信文却是最能赤裸裸地寫作的。所以寫書信文更應當用活的語言，如果用文言文，用古典，那卽使　其寫文言文用古典的能事，也總没有用現代一般活人嘴裏的语言來得更自然眞實了。</p>
<p>但現在最最流行的是分類尺牘體裁的書信，讀者來信所開的書目也以這類書爲多。但它却是最庸俗的爛套的東西。他在大衆中所以能發生廣大影響的原因，就是因爲古典尺牘的難學，不是一般大衆所可仰攀而它則把一些古典構成了一個套了和格式，使人容易照式抄用。這類尺牘不但將書信很機械的劃分　幾部份，各部份都開出一個公式，並按　「各界」人士的社會關係，妥爲排好。這類東西，就在舊式書牘中也是下品，只有不通的人，才去照抄，其中閙出的笑話正多着啊！所以這些東西雖然目下還能流行，實在是不合做學習書信文的模範的。（未完）</p>

<p>「使中華民族爲大仁大智大勇之國民、則必於忠孝節義、植其基、於智識技能求其闕、尙武以備軍人資格、務實以儆末俗虚浮、矢具忠誠、以愛國爲前提、苦具心志、以獵宜爲大戒之爲此言者、恥不若人」、此語出於袁世凱凡後之爲此言者、皆爲袁世凱、且吾國歷史文物、皆爲封建時代之所遺、宜如「無邊落木蕭蕭下」而不足顧惜、則毋怪今日學生頭腦混沌黑白莫辨、又安望科學之進步、以如此思想啓示學生、所關　鉅、非僅白活與文言之爭焉矣、</p>

<h3 id="c218">（一）看衣裳 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>有三隻小松鼠　隻呌红尾巴、一隻呌藍眼睛一隻呌黃小毛　他们知道兒童節快到了、商量穿了　麽衣裳、到學校去開會、</p>
<p>紅尾巴拿出一件红大衣來、嘆口氣說、「我常常穿紅大衣、眞是討　、我想揀别種顔色、一藍眼睛拿出　件藍外套來、也摇頭說、一這藍外套找也穿　了、最好換别的顔色、一黃小毛拿出一黃旗袍來、也說我也討厭這黃色旗袍　、能換别種顔色最好</p>
<p>紅尾巴說、我們去問蝴蝶姑娘、他穿的衣裳的顔色最好、也許他會告訴我們怎麽换顔色的法子、藍眼睛黃小毛都說「很好很好、」他們商量定了、就到蝴蝶家裏去找蝴蝶姑娘、</p>
<p>（二）換顔色</p>
<p>三隻松鼠、找到了蝴蝶姑娘和蝴蝶姑娘商量換顔色的法了</p>
<p>蝴蝶想了　天、　着翅膀說、（有啦、樹林後面有幾個池、你們拿衣裳去洗洗　、也許會變顔色的　、</p>
<p>他們聽了、就去找池、找到三個池、一個是黃水池一個是紅水池、一個是藍水池、紅尾巴的红大衣、　一隻松鼠拿自己的衣裳去洗、紅尾巴的紅大衣、放在黃水池裏洗藍眼睛的藍外套放在紅水池　洗、黃小毛的黃旗袍放在藍水池裏洗、不滿五分鐘、他們说就把衣裳拿起來絞乾红尾巴　看跳起來說、（哦、眞變了、我的红大衣變成橙皮色的顔衣的大衣了、藍眼睛也很奇怪翹着尾巴說、看哪我的藍外套也變了、是紫顔色、多麽美麗啊、黃小毛看看自己的旗袍、也說你們看、不是也變了麽、這是綠顔色」</p>
<p>大家看了都很高興</p>
<p>（三）改名字</p>
<p>兒童節那一天、三隻小松鼠、穿了美　的衣裳、到學校裏來開會、紅尾巴穿的是橙色大衣、監眼睛穿的是紫色外套黃小毛穿的是綠色旗袍、</p>
<p>小朋友們看見他們都好像不認識、　家說「這三位姑娘穿的衣裳眞美麗啊、」</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我說道：「眞的，天氣是太冷了！這巳是穿貂皮的時候了！老祖宗。（譯者按：聞容齡郡主言：宮中人原稱慈禧爲老佛爺，後因當日康熙亦有「老佛爺」之稱，因改老祖宗。此處引用甚當。）我想明天大可穿貂皮了。太后何不就此下個聖諭呢」？</p>
<p>造化！我這幾句話不但不曾得罪，而且立卽取到了伊的同情，於是「翌日起，一律改服貂裘」的聖旨，便絶不遲延的頒布出去了。</p>
<p>第二天，在整個滿淸帝國的疆域之内，只要是有資格可以穿貂皮的官員和命婦，便一　把貂皮穿起來了。而我的那一件新衣服，便頓時變爲一襲最時式，最惹人注意的冬裝了！我想：其時天氣那般的冷，倘没有我這一番勇敢的舉動，旁的人雖想穿貂皮也不能，他們將如何的感謝我：</p>
<p>但是換一方面想一想，都爲我自己想穿那一件有貂皮出鋒的新衣，催太后下了穿貂的聖旨，這聖旨下去之後，正不知累多少人連夜的忙碌起來呢！</p>
<p>在宮裏的時候，每天必有許多的新衣服　　些太監盛在木盤子裏，捧着送進來給皇太后過目。　　宮裏向有不少的裁縫供養着，而這些裁縫又都是絶對不敢貪懶的；於是太后的新衣服，便源源不絶的在製造着了。不過這一次伊上奉天　，却並不曾把那些裁縫帶着同走。</p>
<p>宮裏頭還有一起歷史很悠久，行動很神秘的老婦人養着。伊們飽食終日，一切工作都不做，只是天天低下了頭握着筆在替太后描繪新鞋的花樣。這一次，太后却也不曾把伊們裝載到奉天去。（六二）</p>
<h3 id="c221">潮州戲 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 乃令</p>
<p>上海人對於潮州戲，大概總很生疏吧？難然在臘片上曾有一些潮州曲，但是那種「咿咿呀呀」的調子，不特是上海人聽不慣，我想也没有人樂於去聽它，更何况是聽不懂哩！</p>
<p>最近上海來了一班潮州戲，在法租界某戲院裏已表演了十多天</p>
<p>，我因爲没時間去聽，雖然我是聽得懂。所以我估量着，特地到某戲院去聽潮州戲的，大半是那些僑居上海的潮州人，尤其是一般有閒的老太太，小婦人們。</p>
<p>記得我做小孩子的時候，頗熱中於潮州戲，常常當戲還未開始之前，跑到後台，隔着欄棡偷望「戲先生」在敎戲。</p>
<p>潮州戲最與别個地方特别的，便是潮州戲的伶人都用的是七八歲至十五六歲的小孩子，卽所謂「童伶」者。這些小孩子都是戲班老板，用三幾百元買來的，或是有誰把小孩按給了戲班，講明年月，到期了，這小孩子便可以得到自由。</p>
<p>「戲先生」也是老板僱來的，他的權力最大。敎小孩子學戲時，如有不合他的意思的，竹板，皮鞭，他是不跟你講客氣的。有時一個小孩子做了幾年戲，恢復了自由時早成爲了殘廢的，這是并不　　的事。就算不殘廢，但是給壓制了幾年，一旦到社會上來，没有工作的能力而至流浪爲浪民的，比比皆是，再不然，也只好像乞丐樣過「街頭歌人」的生活。</p>
<p>不過聽說這種悲慘的現象，現在已比較地少有了！</p>

<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>同街的王瓦匠，今年快四十歲了，然而兒女還没有一個，雖然王瓦匠的妻子也曾求　拜廟，燒香許愿，和偷取子孫娘娘面前的小泥娃子。但是一年一年的過去，王瓦匠老婆的肚腹，還是平平的，而没有澎漲起來，這顯見是王瓦匠的求子，已經和今年的婦女國貨年一樣的失敗了！</p>
<p>王瓦匠老婆的肚腹，愈不澎漲，而王瓦匠愈希望它澎漲，並且想它澎漲的心思，也愈急迫，大概是上月吧，王瓦匠又來實行一種求子的工作，倒拖七道溝，這的確是一件有趣新聞。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：不知是上月那一天，王瓦匠約的幾個同行，在一塊空地上守着。而王瓦匠本人呢？郤把他的老婆騙了來。乘伊不防備的時候，猛然把伊推倒，於是他的同行，一個人抓住伊一隻脚，拼命的向前拖。一面拖着；一面問伊「你養不養？」「你養不養？」他老婆不好意思說我養啦，所以就给他們一個不睬。王瓦匠這時眞急了，深恐功虧一篑，於是强迫着伊說。伊雖然是怕羞但是因爲丈夫的强迫，和脊背的疼痛，終於屈服。而說出：「我養啦！」「我養啦！」伊纔在衆人歡呼聲中，低着頭跑回家去。但是脊背上已擦破四五塊皮了！並且爲了這件事，半個月没有出來。</p>

<p>— 金樹德</p>
<p>曾記得我在首都時，東隣有個丁吉榮的妻子，可算得城内一個特等的悍婦了。伊平時最是虐待翁姑，待到丈夫回來，却反在丈夫面前放刁，倒說翁姑的不是，伊丈夫是個做商家的，頗通文字，也知道一些孝道。但是，常經這　内的悍潑陶鎔，有時也把他那孝心一變，順風轉舵，聊博他夫人的歡心。一天丈夫回來，又聽伊說翁姑的不是了。伊丈夫無可如何。便給了伊一個信而不信的答案，以爲這樣就過去了。誰知伊却當丈夫不帮助自己了，便卽趁人不備，梳洗整齊，直僵僵的睡在牀上，把兩眼半開半掩，不發一聲。伊丈夫不經意的進房，一看了這等情形，嚇得魂不附體，急忙呌到父母以及隣人親戚等輩，高呼低喚，好得伊仍是不發一聲。臨了，大家細細的一檢查，却發現了伊左耳上少了一隻耳環，大家以爲伊是呑金尋死的了。隣人們素知伊平日的行爲，便齊口同聲的說，用糞汁從伊的口裏灌到肚子裏去。金子就會嘔吐出來。這時伊急了，便在牀上翻來覆去，手舞足蹈的不肯嘗那臭糞。大家不由分說，七手八脚，將伊　綁起來，撬開伊的牙齒足足灌了約一香烟罐的糞汁，始終也不見有什麽吐出來。我便插口假說是曾在上海看見過這種把戲，索性恐嚇伊道：「除非找外國人來剖肚皮，那才有辦法呢。」伊駭急了，没口子的搶着說道：「不要呀，這是我的做着嚇我丈夫的。那隻耳環，我預先藏在地板底下去了。於是一家人才把心上一塊石頭慢慢的放下來。</p>

<p>食器　，要防污穢，每次喂食，要平均食量，不可過多，大約在三個月前後，每天喂五次至七次，五個月時，喂四次至五次，七個月時，喂三次至四次，一年的狗，朝夕喂兩次。小狗天眞爛漫，最喜　石塊木片，平常可給些木炭與牛骨任其嚙咬，免得夫嚙石塊，傷害消化器。每次飼喂時，可敎以各種藝術，譬如立坐臥翻筋斗等，又爲防除毛的齷　，須常用毛刷刷凈，夏季隔天洗浴。（四）哺乳的注意，假使由自畜的母狗生出來的小狗，約過了十日前後，就能開眼，二十日前後，眼能看物，足亦能立，在生後二十日至三十日間，乳齒漸長，足爪亦利，母狗的乳房常受其齒嚙或爪搔，漸厭惡其吃乳，過了五十日，母乳的量就减，漸漸喂以容易消化的東西，仔犬在生後一週間時，不可多　外界的刺激與暴寒暴熱，食物與狗屋周圍的温度，不可過熱，亦不可過冷，過了二十日，就能行走了。這時必喜歡匍伏在日光下，使其受充分的日光浴，從進發育，其有因尾巴關係，不能發育的，那就犬的種類，可切去尾巴。（五）運動，飼養者每日應當常常帶到外面散步，切不可終日關在室内，過於拘束，失其本性，每日預定一種藝術，循環敎導，旣可以助其運動，又可以練習藝術，如在雨天，爲犬最厭惡的，應當减少食量，免得食積不化。（六）罹病時看護，我們日常與狗接觸，很可以明白其體質與性質，糞便的狀態，精神的盛　，　見可知的，偕若身體瘦弱，寢時起而欲走，走不到幾步，又想臥下，食物减少，鼻凖很乾，或有涕流出，或起咳嗽，呼吸困難，眼脂很多，眼白像充血樣子，或因貧血，呈蒼白色，腹部膨脹，糞便稀薄，或常嘔吐，或要脫毛，這就是罹病的徵象。可是犬的疾病的起源，多在氣候暖熱，蚤虱蚊等害蟲繁殖最盛，或在梅雨潮濕的時期，在這期間内，狗的生活機能，漸起變化，皮　要發生障碍，食物中不免有寄生蟲，侵入胃腸，各種疾病隨之而生了。最厲害的，爲台斯呑　病Ｄｅｔｅｎｂｅｒ心臟病，肺炎，風邪咳嗽）患這病時往往致命，我國人素不重犬，一旦生病，祇用鳥藥，依余蓄犬的經騐，如患風邪，咳嗽，可服表散止咳的藥，但藥湯很不容易灌，最好購粉末從口角送下，這是余的朋友獸醫所敎的，他說狗的生活機能，原來與人相同的，普通的病可完全照醫人的方法醫治，後來經余　試屢騐。患病時，喂飼的食物，應當富於滋養，流動易於消化的，若患　僂病的狗，那要多喂富於維太命Ｄ與加　秀姆Ｃａｌｃｉｕｍ，銀白色的金屬原素，滋養補品）的東西，但是狗最惡　，有臭味的　，可用奶油與平常愛吃的東西拌在藥中，那末，就能够服下了。</p>

<p>— 大年</p>
<p>蝙蝠在中國是普遍的，颇爲衆人所喜歡，是「福氣」的象徵、大概是同音的緣故吧、偶然在黃昏之際、飛入　櫳、「止於坐隅、貌甚閑暇」，「口不能言，請對以臆」，則竟是哲學蝙蝠。牠是鳥類呢？是獸類呢？鳥獸不可與同羣，還是退飛吧，無論其爲鳥爲獸。但偶爾在風凉之處，張着大網，等待着飛蟲，那是蜘蛛。</p>
<p>一時忘記了，不知「　蛸在戶」，是不是這東西。總之，這東西是可厭的，因其織好羅網，撲殺飛蟲，而且也頗妨害人類。小孩們便時常喜歡持着竹枝，刺破牠，趕走牠。</p>
<p>從前有人討論鷄爲五德，後來又有敎書先生加了兩德，一殺得，二喫得。但蜘蛛也頗有幾德了。經綸滿腹，巧製網羅，智也。當風而立，不畏風塵，勇也。與物同色，不露痕迹，和也。靜以制動，柴立其中央，道也。安命俟時，與天爲徒，養也。稍有依倚，逃於虚空，讓也。縱横之間，頗留孔隙，仁也┆┆</p>
<p>細想人間之事，與此無殊。地上有鐵路網，戰時有電網。卽每人身邊也散佈一種雰圍，張着一種羅織物。或者爲名，或者爲利，但必定使人看不透，這便是倫理的善良。因此得到食物，以免自己喝風。本領大者，便佈大網羅，獲大安隠，成爲一大蜘蛛；氣力小者，只張着小絲，得小食品。而敎育之類，不過是敎人怎樣作的巧妙而巳。當然懶惰不得，這便是爲什麽敎人勤勞。也不能太發露，觸目，這便是敎人謙退，自卑，涵養。</p>
<p>凡世事大抵如此的，這并非譏嘲，人反正是自然界的一種動物，有着自然界的德性，古人謂自然爲「天」，應該「觀天之道，執天之行」。但莊子是不可及的，他呌人「入遊其樊，而無咸其名」。便是呌人化爲螟螓，從孔隙間穿過去，而不觸到絲綫。丨但至今還不見有破毁這網羅的哲學。</p>

<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>「通」字大概用於儒林，美稱有所謂「通人」，鄙稱有所謂「不通」，不通就是一曲之士了。所以士人所專心致志的，　通而巳。　　通人的含義，是很混統的。一般於有意無意間，默認了王充「論衡」的诠釋：「博覽古今者爲通人」。其實這定義是並不全的。章學誠在「文史通義」内篇四「横通」一文中，曾說：「通人之名，不可以概擬也。有專門之精，有兼覽之博。各有其不可易，易則不能爲良：各有其不相謀，謀則不能爲益。然通之爲名，蓋取譬於道路，四　八達，無所不至，謂之通也；亦取其心之所識，雖有高下偏全大小廣狹之不同，而皆可以達於大道，故曰通也」。是說頗爲精確。王充所言，不過指出通的一面是不全的。　　但是貌似通而其實是不通的，却也所在多有。所以章氏於通以外，特設「横通」一詞，以包括這類的事態。何謂横通？他接着上文說：「然亦有不可四　八達，不可達於大道，而亦不得不謂之通。是謂横通。横通之與通人，同而異，近而遠，合而離」。這分别尤辨析了。　　世間目横通爲通人，自以横通爲通人的,眞不知有多少。卽以章氏章氏而論，其傑作「文史通義」中的「六經皆史」說，「易敎」篇對於「周易」爲史的解釋，胡適就說「很露出勉强拉攏的痕跡」（見「章實齋先生年譜。但僅係解釋的未臻精善，初無損於其「六經皆史，」說的價値），所謂「勉强拉攏」，以章氏自己所說的話來解釋，就陷於横通的窠　。章氏一生致力於通，而結果尙有未能盡避横通處，可見通是不容易的。</p>
<p>前人讀書，常有所謂「一旦豁然貫通」的話。後人看到這話，也常以爲這是一種奇蹟。這是由於閱者僅看到僅注意「一旦」二字而其實是一點也不看到不注意「一旦」二字的緣故。一旦豁然貫通，並非一種奇蹟，須知在這「一旦」以前，眞不知巳用去幾許的精力了，才能有這豁然貫通的「一旦」。這與漸變說突　說二者間的並行不悖，同一道理。　　然而今人求通，突不然了。許多學科的書，常殿以「百日通」的醒目語，如「ＸＸ百日通」之類。漫然看來，比之「一旦」，用力爲多；然而書僅薄薄一册，時僅短短百日，竟能指計以待通了，這倒的係一種奇蹟。雖說科學方法可以節省人的精力，但並非敎人不學的。且所謂「百日通」，其本身的内容，通乎不通，還是一絶大的疑問！這名詞的本身巳不通了，而運用這名詞，更是曲之至。語云「不學無術」而現在是「術而不學」，藉術以驅人入於不學的一途。這裏不曰「有術不學」而曰「術而不學」，以見這術也很可懷疑的。　　晚近以來，因國際關係的交錯，又有所謂「ＸＸ通」者，紛然出現。這原是很好的現象。但也未必能一概而論罷？章氏在「橫通」篇中說那些贩書，藏書，刻書者流，有云：「其人不過琴工碑匠，藝業之得接於文雅者耳。所接名流旣多，習聞淸言名論。而胸無智珠，則道聽塗說，根底之淺陋，亦不難窺」。一兩句「洋涇浜」的外国或語，驟然聽來，不也是淸脆悅耳的麽？</p>
<p>在學，風浮薄的今日，横通是大有其人的。</p>

<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>我本巳决心，今晚不再上峯去看燈。預備在船室中洋燭光底下的小桌子上整理白天的畫稿；或者躺着閱讀新到的雜誌；黃昏肚饑時向船主婦借隻碗，到岸上去買碗「救命糰子」吃吃，倒比投身在人海的渦旋裏看燈，來得有味。但是我後來終於變計，又跟了船主人上岸去看燈了。</p>
<p>所以變計者，一半是因了船主人的勸進。一半是受了鼓樂聲的誘惑。船主人說，今晚的燈比昨晚好得多，有從别碼頭借來的臺閣，有七十幾節的「金華老龍」；遠方特地雇舟來看的也不少，我們便路到此，樂得一看。我聽了這般盛况，覺得應該隨喜。同時鼓樂喧　之聲從遠近各處送進我的船室來，使我聽了覺得脚底上癢癢的，不由地收拾畫具書冊，跟着船主人跳上岸去「與衆樂樂」了。</p>
<p>鼓樂所用的樂器，都是不能奏旋律的打樂器：所奏的音樂，也只是簡單的幾句腔調的反覆，正如小孩們口中所唱：「同同上，登登上，登登次登次登上┆」。但牠具有一種奇妙的誘惑力，能吸引遠近各處的人心。回憶昨晚在燈會中所聽到的絲竹管絃之音，表面雖似複雜，但在我看來（其實是聽來，但不妨說看來）反比鼓樂簡單。憑我的記憶　，昨夜所聞的絲竹管絃曲的旋律，若用簡譜記</p>
<p>錄起來，都不外乎</p>
<p>51615丨516156丨6161152丨323232</p>
<p>3312丨1611653丨5┆┆</p>
<p>的敷衍。聽得過久了，使我覺得心頭上癢癢的，非常難熬。而且這癢無法可掻；卽使立刻掩耳却走，仍是帶着這癢走的。鼓樂則不然，遠聽時脚底上發癢；只要跟了大衆跑，就會爽快。跑到近處，身心就會同化在鼓樂的節奏中，跟了牠昻奮起來。聽得過久了，至多也不過使你疲勞，却决不曾使你難熬。這是中國音樂的特産。據我所知，西洋音樂上似乎没有全用打樂器組成的演奏法。</p>
<p>所以我跟船主人上岸，名爲看燈，其實是想看看鼓樂的演奏。這會我們站在橋畔看燈。许多花燈像轎子一般地抬過橋去。後來爲了前途障碍，一齊停下了。停在我面前的，是裝着「提倡生活」，「於民同樂」等大字匾額的一座燦爛的臺閣。後面跟着的是一班打樂隊。我便從人叢中擠到後面去，細看那打樂隊的演奏。奏法率直得很，但把鑼鼓鐃鈸等器交互相間地敲擊，自成一種雍容浩蕩的音節。鼓的奏法尤爲率直，老是「同，同，同，同」地敲的，永不變化其節奏。但因了其他樂器的配合。自能表現一種特殊的効果。敲鼓的樣子更使我驚異：一個孩子背着一面鼓向前跑，鼓手跟在後面一路打去，好像追殺敗將一般。孩子跑得越快，後面打的追得越緊；孩子立停了讓他打，他就擺開步位，出勁地痛打一頓。孩子背後受人痛打，前面管自吃芝蔴餅。餅上的芝蔴跟了鼓的「同，同，同，同」而紛紛地落下，他伸手接住了芝蔴，慢慢地用舌舐食。我走近去看，但見他全身的衣服，筋肉，連頭髮，都跟了鼓的打擊而瑟瑟地顫動。他的内臟一定出跟着了鼓聲而振盪着。這是一種無微不至的全身運動。吃下芝蔴餅去，消化想是很快的。但我細看那孩子的年齡，不過十歲左右，他的皮肉很嫩，他的骨節一定不很堅牢。這樣劇烈地敲到夜半，這副嫩骨頭可被敲散，回家去非找他的母親從新編穿過不可呢。</p>
<p>速取速寫簿來，描取這般驚異的現狀。描成，鼓樂隊就開拔漸漸遠去。收了速寫簿再聽鼓樂，音節遠不及以前的雍容浩蕩，似乎帶着悽慘之氣了。（二十三年五月二十日）</p>

<h3 id="c248">爲本市衛生運動進一言 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦子</p>
<p>衛生運動在我國今日是非常需要的。中國人確是太不講衛生了。外國人對我們中國如此批評，我們自己也常對如此責備自己。然而，中國爲什麽太不講衛生呢？這倒又是一個大問題。中國人不是素來太不講衛生的，而是目前的中國，無法講究衛生。這話怎講？那末我們看罷：中國人幾個可以很安全的過着他的極平淡的生活的？一飯一粥，尙且都發生問題，試問在這情况下，谁又有工夫和金錢去講究衛生不衛生？固然，講究衛生，並不定要什麽大的工夫，和許多的金錢，然而在事實上講，講究衛生，却又非有相當的工夫與金錢不可。譬如，剃頭沐浴，這是很簡單的衛生工作。在一班生活比較優裕的人，固不成問題，然而在大羣的窮苦人民，這也使得他們成爲問題的。剃頭要錢，沐浴要錢，錢雖不多，而總是要的。他們平常吃一頓飯還成問題，能省則省，這樣他們就只有把剃頭沐浴的工作稍爲延長時間了。這是他們無法講這衛生之一端。這還是小問題，此外衛生一事在他無法行之之處尙多，尤其是家庭起居飲食之淸潔等等，在他們更絶對谈不到。至於一旦生病，則問題更困難了，他們簡直只有等死，因爲除開幾百錢可以請到的巫醫之類的江湖術士之外，一般醫生，原則上他們是無法過問的。請問在這情况下，雖要呌他們講衛生，又如何可得呢？這當然是不可得的。</p>
<p>本市衛生局，現定自本月十九日起，開始全市衛生運動，這當然是一件很有意義很値得贊同的事件。很希望人人能實行，但是我們更希望再進一步着手，如掃淸街道，淸除坑厠等，尙是初步的工作，而最重要的，還在怎樣使一般人都能講衛生，都能有很適當的衛生環境。這雖是社會一個根本問題，而非簡單的衛生運動可能奏效，然而我們總希望衛生當局對此能盡力加以注意。如工人區域之污穢不潔這是人所共認的事實。怎樣使他們能淸潔呢？這當然非是掃一次街道洒一次臭藥水所能奏效的，而必須先呌他們怎樣去维持以後的衛生，這才是根本的工作。總之，我們希望當局能多爲一般貧民着想。因爲貧民最不衛生，有錢人用不到人去向他講衛生，他早已過着很衛生的日子了。丢開貧民不問，衛生就會一無結果的。這一點，要請衛生當局注意。</p>
<h3 id="c249">結婚 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 非</p>
<p>人類，不論男或女，到了相當的年齡，便本能地發動它的靑春機能，那時，就是需要性的安慰的最初時期。由於開始性的需要而便巴巴的希望結婚了。</p>
<p>性的煩悶，是一般靑年的通病：因爲性的苦悶而引起了精神頽廢，才感到現實生活的無聊，單調。爲了要調劑生活的意味，就得去找一個生活的伴侣。結婚，那是解决這一切問題的最好對象，而且是實際方法。這在每一個靑年都會這樣想法，一到了靑春時期，便要不自控制的去憧憬結婚，組織小家庭。不錯，理想中的婚後生活是多麽美麗呵！</p>
<p>多末愉快呵！尤其當幸福的小家庭生活開始的時候，整個的生命也充滿了生氣和喜悅。</p>
<p>小家庭是幸福的宮殿，温柔的仙鄕，甚至是甜蜜的樂園。這週遭的環境，都似乎在玫瑰色的夢境裏，生活在這裏的主人們，當然也彷佛喝醉了葡萄酒那樣的酣醉。</p>
<p>可是，甜蜜儘管甜蜜，酣醉儘量酣醉，而生活的重壓，却毫不客氣地在你肩頭上加重，煩惱的刑具也鎖住了你一生！</p>
<p>結婚是戀愛的　墓：人們在戀愛的過程中，是美妙的，光明的。然而，愛情到了相當程度，就希望早些結婚，早些實行同居。但是到了同居以後，却使你失望，覺得以前的過去，都是空虚的，只有那一幕糢糊的回憶，還　留在腦膜上。</p>
<p>人生本不是完全没有幸福的，但，幸福也是要你自己去找。人類更不是完全没有痛苦的，但痛苦也是你自己去尅服，去解除。不過，所謂痛苦，所謂幸福，要在當事者纔能够體騐得到其中的眞味，在第三者看來，却不能肯定的武斷。因爲各人的觀感誰都不同的，爲了觀感的不同，於是引起的影響亦各殊。譬如說：在别人看來你是很幸福的，其實，在你却感到無上的痛苦！在你以爲吾的生活是極痛苦的，而反之，在吾是毫没感覺，好像是很快樂的。總之，這些完全是各人的感覺與志趣的表現不同，結婚何嘗不是一樣？</p>
<p>友人馬君，與徐女士，是由美滿的戀愛過程而結合的；最近，吾去拜望他們，乘便探詢馬君婚後的生活如何，他惟對吾摇摇頭。同時吾再去向徐女士詢問，她也微笑而不答。這裏，他們給了吾一個很明顯的暗示；結婚後的生活，原來不過如此！但是吾想，再過三年四年，也許還要無味，孩子有了一大羣，家庭的經濟，也會隨之而膨脹，生活也就不安定。從前有人說：一個人結了婚是好像被判了無期徒刑一樣；這句話吾到今日才證明它確非過語。</p>
<p>不過，總而言之，結婚可說是人生一生中，最快樂的一刹那，然而也就是最痛苦的種開始萌芽的時候，將來開出來的花，當然是煩惱的，而最後結出來的果也是辛酸的。</p>
<p>這種情形，吾相信嘗試過結婚生活的人，一定會表同情的。</p>
<h3 id="c250">從高跟皮鞋說起 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 白榕</p>
<p>以偶然的機會，讀到普力　諾夫書中所引的幾句法國學者的話，使我想到婦女的高跟皮鞋以及近代窮奢極侈的裝飾，而生了許多感想。那幾句話是這樣的：</p>
<p>「在綏内更毘，富裕的尼格羅女人，脚上穿着不能完全穿進去的那樣狹小的鞋子，所以這些女人，因爲很拘束的步行，顯得特别。然而這步行，是被算作極其媚惑的。」</p>
<p>因爲被視爲極其媚惑的，故不惜忍受行動拘束的痛苦，穿上那不適用的不舒服的鞋子，這不僅是尼格羅一族的「特殊風光」，和這同樣的，遠之有中國古代的三寸金蓮，近之則有風靡全世界的高跟皮鞋。</p>
<p>把肢體任何一部加以摧殘而造成畸形狀態，是該認爲最荒謬的事，多少醫學家已經證明高跟鞋是有害的了，然而科學家鐵面無私的論證終敵不過羣衆盲目的崇拜。於是在「城中好高　，四方高一尺。」的情况之下，高跟皮鞋遂由幾個時髦的都市所領導而　　成爲一時代婦女裝飾之主要的傾向。</p>
<p>其實，據我們看來，這現象終有些可笑，一個人的脚不用來平正均衡地走路，偏偏跕起脚尖，造成欹側不穏的姿態，來博取人們的讚美，這简直有點愚　。可是辯護者却口口聲聲地說：「這是增加體材的娉婷和腰肢的婀娜的啊！」因爲在這些人眼中看來，只有高跟皮鞋纔能增加人們美麗的。可是，美眞有</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>絶對的標凖嗎？據我所知，審美觀念往往隨社會心理而變更，而社會心理之根據則爲整個社會基礎及其時代。美是隨時間空間之變更而變更的。古代三寸金蓮，巳爲現代人所蔑棄，而菲洲穿耳　彩的裝飾，也只能在他們那樣的社會及地域中盛行。現在是資本社會　爛時代，在這種時代中的都市裏，人們的心理多趨於色情的享受，他們要求女子穿高跟鞋，戴高價裝飾品，塗　丹，搽黃胭脂，他們的審美標凖是婀娜，娉婷，細緻，温柔，鮮艶，再進一步的說，要肉感！而這些的主要目的，却是適合自己的要求與享受。因此在這種社會裏，高跟鞋以及種種奢侈品，是「被視爲極其媚惑的。」而風靡一代。</p>
<p>在男性中心的社會裏，婦女的被壓迫程度可謂逹於極點，她們不能有美的標凖，她們美的標凖須視周圍男子所需要而定。她們是被視爲一種裝飾品或甚至游戲品而生存到這世界上來的。封建勢力支配下的女性不用說，卽如思想較進步的女性而論，也往往不能突破這道難關，天下還有比這更不平的事嗎？然而這「不平」却因司空見慣，由刺激而淡漠，由淡漠而忘却了。</p>
<p>新的女性是要覺醒起來的。她們應當知道這不僅是一種欺騙，簡直是一種侮辱。她們不會因人們「認爲是極爲媚惑的。」而矯揉造作，失去自己的本性。從覺醒到改革的第一步，便是把枷鍊從自己肢臂上掙破，把高跟鞋以及許多無謂的裝飾品從自己身上解除下來！</p>

<h3 id="c252">談談商標與招牌的作用 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>舊時商店，必有一個招牌，而目下新式的商店公司或工廠，則又都有商標。商標與招牌，都是表示該一商店或公司等的營業標誌，而暗示其某種營業或出品的身份的。如家庭工業社的出品商標是用「家庭工業社」五個字拼成的一只蝴蝶作商標，陳嘉庚公司出品商標則是一個中字外面再加上一個圓圈。這些商標，都是表示該一工廠的出品標誌，而以便購買者識别的。</p>
<p>商標的作用很大。在外國，常時一個商標可以估價到幾萬元至幾十萬元。因爲這商標的價値，就是代表該一公司或工廠的全部出品價値。商標没有商品作基礎，就不能在社會上佔到重要地位；而同時商品没有商標作識别，也不能獨出一格，爲各個人所一見就認識。這可見商標的價値。</p>
<p>我國舊時無商標，而祇有招牌，又因這招牌大都不註册者，而且那時也没有註册的辦法，所以招牌的冒仿，在我國也就特别流行。如蘇州之稻香村，上海之陸稿荐，幾乎到處皆是，卽其一例。</p>
<p>招牌與商標，不獨在商業上盛行，同樣在其他方面也甚盛行。尤其是文壇方面，近年也特别盛行了。某人做過一部什麽奇怪的書，或是做過一些什麽奇怪的事，這時，這樣怪書怪事，也就可以作爲一種商標或招牌了。如先有情書一束，接着再來二束，於是廣告上便大吹大擂，說前之一束這樣顚倒了一些人類，當然，二束也是不煩言而很好的了。大家去買呀。再如，我以前曾做過性史一類怪書，而被人注目，現在我再來做其他文章，這時就可將以前的怪書抬出來，而呌人再對我注目。這樣，我的文章，出路就多了。當然，書商也特别賺錢。這就是一種商標與招牌的作用。</p>
<p>與這相像，近來慣用招牌的人很多。如法官退任而作律師，必曰：某某前曾任某某高等法院推事，某某地方法院推事：官銜越多越好。爲的是什麽？爲的是借此可以作爲招牌。又如賣書畫的，也必定要裝上一些前淸太史孝廉乃至什麽道員撫員之類，這樣，這人的身份就顯得特别高而且雅，他的作品（商品）,也就可以特别容易推銷了。此外測字算命，大概都會來這一套。好在社會是盲目的丨他們認爲丨只要招牌掛得好，不愁商品無出路。商品究竟好不好呢？</p>
<p>買貨的人原是不管的。</p>
<p>招牌與商標，不獨盛行於商業，而且盛行於一切方面。鳴呼，這個一切商品化了的社會！</p>

<p>— 沙雁</p>
<p>登家　頭，一名登家口，這是山東省一個産魚量較多的區域，地屬諸城縣，當每年榖雨後，爲捕魚期之始。自三月初以後，以至五月，這個期間稱爲捕魚節。</p>
<p>當捕魚節前十日，魚人便紛紛趕往登家窰頭，擇地搭棚，以作捕魚期中的臨時家庭。每年約到有兩千棚左右，同時除專在這時期中的魚戶外，並且，另有千數百棚專做魚戶生意者，如：飯棚，茶棚，烟館，酒棚，賭塲，戲攤，摇子，以及其他日用品等小攤。可說除一般市面所有的京莊金銀業等較多大商店外，簡直是應有盡有了，並且，在這棚草中的玩笑塲中，也有頭二三等的分野，眞可谓階級之層，遍於人間了。</p>
<p>在過去，魚戶們在這時期多多少少是可以獲到相當的利益的，可是，近年來因社會經濟的日頻於破産，人民購買力的缺乏，外魚的傾消，官卡的苛削，以及捕魚魚具的不良，不足與侵入我領海的外國魚船相竸爭，這些以致促成了那般魚人的日視其職業的死路，所以，年來該地的捕魚節，不復如昔的閙熱，興盛了。</p>

<p>「汽笛」已拉過第二次了，拉第三次時是要進廠的，於是我怱忙地穿上昨天洗淸的藍布短褂，提了飯籃就向外跑。　　陽光已滿佈在地上了。我大踏步地向廠裏去，一輛「特備車迅速地駛過，裏面滿裝着一車藍布短衫的同志，他們也是上工去的，接着赤脚的健漢，挑着一担担的靑菜　　上街去買：巡捕在十字路口指揮着來往的車輛；穿着士林布長衫或旗袍的提小皮箱的學生們，他們或她们都加着迅速的步伐上學去；運動員在馬路上練習長途的徑賽呢。一路上我看見的是這些，於是我奇怪了，爲什麽那日林大嫂子帶我上什麽「大馬路」去玩，那時所看見的是坐在汽車裏養着八字鬚的老爺和他身旁肥胖雪白的太太，穿外國衣服的少爺和携手同行的小姐，以及抱在她們懷裏的小哈叭狗兒，現在都找不到了呢？思索了一會，我便知道這淸晨破曉，才是我們自食其力的勞働者的唯一佔利品。</p>
<p>我愉快地仍舊走我的路，今天我是分外的高興，因爲我知道可愛的淸晨是我們這階級裏的獨佔物。雖然一天到晚，我没有一刻休息的時候，可是這時我想，我的精神是愉快的，雖然每天我是不停地淌着滿臉的汗，但這汗的代價便是我碗裏的飯，我以自己的勞力來維持我的生命，這是多麽光輝的人生啊！</p>

<p>我們畫會同人，日前假寗波同鄕會，開第一屆展覽會，開會三天，來賓達一萬餘人，外界輿論得到很好的批評，如唐冠玉，李秋君，虞澹涵；顧靑瑶，楊雪瑶，楊雪玖，鮑亞暉，徐慧，黃映芬，龐左玉，余靜芝，江亞南，丁筠碧，都是已很負時譽而無庸再作贅言的，還有許多如，姚新華，何怡，魏心雲，樊彩霞，朱志賢，翁文璧，翁慶雲，潘渭，丁慕氷，她們的作品，也購去不少，鄧碧華的手書金剛經橫額字跡秀媚婀娜中含剛勁，倘假以時日，她的書法是未可限量的，魯藻魯芹的花卉，蒼秀娟逸，骨力墨韵，都很値得來介紹的。</p>
<p>我希望以後我們女子要特别踴購提倡藝術莫讓步於男子纔是，决不是考究一些外表的時裝衣飾，就可算表示她的美觀吧，當這時代的許多女性，都只注重舶來品的藝術，對於國粹文藝，似乎於她們看作毫不相干的，我相信一般摩登女郎和太太們，除了能操純熟的英語外，很少有肯研究中國固有的藝術，你要問她中國的文藝化在那裏，恐怕她們十居九數不能回答吧。</p>

<h3 id="c256">她對不起你麽？ <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我今年二十一歲，在十九歲時由媒說親，同一位並不識字的女子，訂了白首之緣，後來我家因爲祖母多病之故，要她到我家同居，以便奉湯待藥，雙方同意，因此她就搬到我家同居。此後，我事畢返家，每日敎她讀書，所以我們倆人頗爲親愛，常有接近的機會，不久我們倆就發生了肉體關係。自從發生了之後，我發覺她┊┊┊後來倆人言明後，果然不出我所料，她在十五歲的時候，已與異性發生過性關係，大約巳有四五次。但我是個淸白的童身，並没有同異性接觸過的人。她已不是處女。她如何對得起我呢？所以我今天特地寫這封不通的信，給親愛的主編先生，請你給我一個圓滿的答覆，好嗎？要請你給我答覆的幾條是：</p>
<p>（一）她巳經早同異性發生了關係，現在我同她脫離，法律上有没有我的罪呢？（不過現在我也同她發生了三次的接觸）</p>
<p>（二）假使說雙方各不離婚，有没有好的收成結果呢？</p>
<p>（三）她現在巳經是十七歲的女子，我旣失身於她，於我的前途有妨碍嗎？</p>
<p>（四）現在我還是以法律起訴呢？還是另用何種方法對付她呢？</p>
<p>請先生給我一個澈底的指示，能使我精神方面不受什麽刺激，敬祝你文安　呂新祺謹啓</p>
<p>答：男女在訂婚或婚後，兩人都應保持绝對的貞操，决不能再與旁人發生性關係，但在此以前，任何一方是否與旁人發生過性關係，其他一方却無權過問，不應追究。換句話說，貞操不追溯已往，它祇從兩人結合後開始。這是現代一般人公認的貞操觀念。你因爲妻子以前曾與别人發生過性關係，就認爲她對不起你，分明還是受了傳統的貞操觀念的影響太深。這是很不應當的。固然，我們也承認：靑年男女，在没有與人訂過婚約以前，也不應當隨便與他人發生性關係，但這祇是指他的個人的品行，貞潔而言。他對於未來的配偶並不負貞操責任。所以你的妻子，假如在没有訂婚以前與旁人發生過性關係，這你根本是没有權利可責備她的。你因爲自己是童身，覺得失身於一個不是處女的女子，有點可惜，這是可以的，說她對不起你，却有點滑稽，拿它當做理由要離婚，更是講不通了，我對於你能在結婚前保持貞潔，很是尊敬，但試問，在靑春時那個没有春情衝動，在這時期，假如你受了異性引誘，而不克自制，與異性發生過性關係，這種行爲雖說不應當，但你覺得是否應原諒呢？如果責備你，那你能覺得這是不苛刻，而心服麽？爲什麽你的妻子搬來同居之後，因爲「倆人頗爲親愛，常有接獨的機會，不久就發生了肉體關係」呢？你平心靜氣設身處地一想，恐怕你也會覺悟到你的怪她是太自私了，度量太狹了，自己定會啞然失笑的。你這種偏見是决不能據爲離婚的理由，所以它存在一天，你就要痛苦，煩惱一天，這眞是自討苦吃。反之，你把這種偏見完全抛開，完全原諒她，那她一定更是敬愛你，你們「倆人頗爲親愛」要變爲「更爲親愛」，這樣，生活不是很幸福的麽。結婚的幸福是要雙方愛情的堅固，假如你娶了個以前很貞潔的女子，但夫婦間毫無愛情可言，這纔是有苦說不出，所以我希望你千萬别自尋煩惱，把雙方的感情弄壞，因而將你的很幸福的生活斷送了。</p>
<p>至於你所詢的四個問題，都是不應該發生的，所以我也不　　　了　　　　　編者</p>

<p>「不，你要知道那個是時敏自己要我給他敲的，我不過是替他敲下來，以不是我自己要。」那個孩子反駁着說：「老實說，你　告訴他爸爸好了，我就不怕他。難道他們自己家裏的人要，我给她敲一敲，也是我的不是麽？「</p>
<p>「嗅？」灰鷄婆轉時敏說：「是你敎他給你敲的嗎？回頭小心你爸爸打死你。可是你比他大呀，」他又在指着那孩子：「他要，你就替他敲嗎？你爲什麽偿跟他說那是敲不得的？</p>
<p>「┆┆那個孩子没有說什麽，便和原來的那一羣孩子們跑走了，留下他割稻子的長工們一同回去。</p>
<p>當他剛走大門的時候，首先看見母親在院子裏晒衣裳。母親看見了他，便大聲呌着說：</p>
<p>你到底跑到那兒去了呢？爲什麽一個早晨便偷偷的跑了，害得我到處都找遍了，眞把我急死了。你要出去幹嗎不告訴我一聲呢？這麽一點兒大，便在外面瞎跑，假使給騙子騙去了，怎麽辦呢？後來還是聽見一個人說，看見你和灰鷄婆哥一同去了，才使我放心。」</p>
<p>一會兒姑媽也來了，看見他身上紥滿了圓球，知道他是捉蟋　來了的，便去給他拿了蟋蟀籠子來，一個一個很小心的關進籠子中去。不久，又聽見母親在說：</p>
<p>「快來，跟我吃粥去，一個早晨没有吃，可憐總要餓死了的。並且辫子也没有梳，蓬得這個樣子，不難過嗎？」</p>
<p>時敏不想去，現在捉了许多蟋蟀，馬上就想和姑媽的大頭鬼鬥一次，分一分高低勝負。可是母親一定不肯，一定　將他拉到廚房。洗過臉，吃了粥，又是梳辫子，換了給露水浸濕了的鞋子，一直躭擱了老半天，才算弄得齊齊整整，從母親身邊跑開。</p>
<p>首先他最要緊的，便拿飯粒給蟋蟀吃，他知道牠們一定餓得很利害的，一個早晨到現在還没有吃東西。他又跑到菜園裏去拆了幾朶絲瓜花，而且要上面還沾着露水的。可是現在已經不早，花上的露水已經给太陽晒乾了，没有辦法，只好拆幾朶放在淸水裏面浸一下，花上面帶　幾點水滴，將就給牠們吃一　　　　　　　　繪牠們吃　的於是他將飯粒和絲瓜花放到籠子裏去，　　看　那些蟋蟀在狼呑虎　的在吃，差不多可以聽得出牠們吃東西的</p>

<h3 id="c258">希佛萊麥唐娜之爭？ <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 梅聖</p>
<p>希佛萊否認於前麥唐娜闢謡於後</p>
<p>茂立斯希佛萊和琴妮麥唐娜間之爭，已經喧傳了很久了。他的起點，據說是因爲米高梅公司呌希佛萊和麥唐娜重新合作，拍一張「風流寡婦」（ｔｈｅ　ｍｅｒｒｙ　ｗｉｄｏｗ），而希佛萊竟拒絶這個建議。他們說希佛萊拒絶的理由，係他不願意再和琴妮合作，因爲他和琴妮合拍，她的節目一定會　過了他的。這樣他太吃虧了。這種傳聞，在好萊塢是閙得大家議論紛紛。後來希佛萊發表了一次談話，否認他曾拒绝和琴妮合作。但是否認儘管否認，外間的謡傳仍是紛紛不息。有一位新聞記者，特將此事再向琴妮請敎。以下就是琴妮對於此事所發表的意見。</p>
<p>「這　簡直太可笑了，」琴妮說。「他們怎麽這樣會造謡。你們一定想兩個情感熱烈的明」</p>
<p>星中間，又發生了什麽重大的爭執了，他們互相拒絶合作了。其實，那裏來的爭執？都是没有的事！那位新聞記者又問：「那末你對於外間的謡傳，有什麽感想呢？」琴妮直捷爽快地說道；「那還有什麽感想呢，旣然係没有那回事了？茂立斯和我，現在和從前一樣，是極要好的朋友。我們中間絶對没有發生過什麽爭執。我和希佛萊合拍影戲的時候，我一些不覺得我心中有什麽　我之見。其餘的還有什麽可說呢？」她說着一面從她　　的玉指插在她輕鬆，　曲，金黃色的頭髮裏梳弄着。她身上還穿着藍緞子的睡衣，眞是　媚極了。一回兒她又繼續着說　：一我從小就常受我母親的敎訓，不許參加或被　入任何紛爭的漩渦。她說最好的方法，就是不去注意到那種紛爭。我母親對於這件事能够以身作則，很謹愼地避免一切隣居間的爭論，不參加任何意見。這是我受之於我母親的一個好敎訓，在這件事情裏，我尤其要聽從她的指敎。</p>
<p>「起初外間的謡言，將我嚇壞了。像颶風一樣，在我四週旋轉着，我完全係個被動的主腦。可是現在好了，茂立斯自己出來否認了，我亦事實上成了「風流寡婦了，我再要說什麽話，豈不是要再製造出一個反高潮嗎？我現在所能說的就是，我被派定了「風流寡婦」的角色，我很高興。我知道我和茂立斯的合作，一定可以使「風流寡婦」成爲一個完美的作品。但是有一點，我是完全同意於茂立斯的見解的就是茂立斯和我，並不是什麽不可分離的老搭擋。我們前後一同合演了三張片子，就是“ｔｈｅ　ｌｏｖｅ　ｒａｒａｄｃ”“ｏｎｅ　ｈｏｕｒ　ｗｉｔｈ　ｙｏｕ，”和“ｌ和ｏ和ｖｅｍｅ　ｔｏｎｉｎｈｔ。”但是大家總以爲我們已經合演了幾十張片子似的。其實，茂立斯獨自亦演過許多好片子，我獨自亦演過許多好片子。不過我們合作了，再加上劉别謙來做導演，因爲劉先生是位天才導演，那就非成功不可。現在「風流寡婦」　茂立斯和我合演，由劉别謙導演，所以我們對於這張片子，希望是很高的。」</p>
<p>「有人說希佛萊對於你的成功，有些嫉妒，你相信不相信？」那位新聞記者，又問着。琴妮不假思索地道：那都是胡說。「風流寡婦」　，兩個角色，至少是並重的。再則茂立斯自已是位很同的藝術家，他爲什麽要拍我偷他的片子呢？再則，我深知道茂立斯是很注重一張影片的全部結構的。他决不肯爲自己打算，而犧牲影片的全部，或是爲自己表演的見長，而採用次等角色作他的配　。我是深知茂立斯的，我豈能相信外間的謡言。我旣不相信，我還有什麽意見可發表呢？</p>
<p>查「風流寡婦」以前在一九○三年曾拍過一次。主演者何人，現在一時記不淸了。現在琴妮　唐娜和希佛萊合拍的，當然是不至於比較以前的作品遜色的。這種老片子的重攝，如「白姊妹一亦其一例，雖然由於題材缺乏之故，但是在他一方面，它們亦能使我們温故知新，决不至於使我們發生　倦之感的。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c259">評「我不負卿」 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｌｅｔ’ｓ　ｆａｌｌ　ｉｎ　ｌｏｖｅ</p>
<p>丨大光明</p>
<p>從許多以描寫電影界之黑幕爲主要題材的影片中，我們可以知道不少關於好萊塢的資料，從攝製影片的經過以至於他們自身的暴露。本來這種現象是製片商人爲了迎合影迷們之好奇的興趣而不惜出賣自己，這是美國電影的商品化之具體的表現。</p>
<p>現在這裏又有一個類似的故事。我們不妨叙述一遍。</p>
<p>某影片公司有一個瑞典女明星，她非常驕傲，她目空一切。她拍戲的時候不肯留參觀的人在攝影塲，她不容易和導演或自己所不歡喜的配角合作，因此她在開拍一個新片子的時候，她忿然離開攝影塲而回家去了。没有辦法，祇好另找能代替她的女演員。果然，給導演在馬戲塲中物色到一個新的人材。他爲了要得製片老　之信任與博觀衆好奇之心理起見，便用種種方法，說那少女亦是瑞典　，而表演的技巧亦甚佳。自然，製片商撥巨欵爲之宣傳，她的聲名赫然不可一世。就在這種情形之下，少女對於導演感其知遇之恩，而悄悄的愛上了他。誰知却引起了導演未婚妻之妒嫉，乃當衆揭破她們的秘密，於是她們大爲狼狽。但是就因着這一絶好的宣傳資料，該影片大爲電影院所注意，爭相購置。這麽一來，便又穏固那導演和主角的地位，並且使他們結合了。</p>
<p>不消說，故事的本身是没有絲毫積極性，充其量不過是一個平常的結構，然而假使我們了解它是影射某一件事，對於人們是可以引起一種輕鬆之快感的，這便是本片獵奇的成功，也便是製片商人之營業上的成功。可不是麽？那一驕傲的瑞典明星，酷像人們所宣傳的葛萊泰嘉　一樣。而另一假的瑞典明星之製造，我們不必知道他是何所影射，但是那一個猶太人的製片老　，却是給譏諷得很够的。</p>
<p>從這一方面說我們看導演對於那一個飾嘉　的，不僅是身材和動作要相似，卽在發音方面，也是極力　倣。其後對於那製造出來的假瑞典明星和導演人，却没有使用譏諷的手法，使觀衆頗爲同情似的，這一點不知是何用意，而對於那ｐｒｏｄｕｃｅｒ却是極盡挖苦之能事，那種商人市儈的氣概，由ｇｒｏｇｏｒｙ　ｒａｔｏｆｆ之純熟的表現，眞是可笑之至。假使說雷電華特種戰事鉅片麥克勞倫主演「孤軍魂」丨大上海映</p>
<p>這一影片確實獲得了輕鬆的效果，那末自然是得力於他不少。</p>
<p>從這些地方說，我們可看　導演十足的美國之特殊的作風。他用着極經濟的手法，快ｔｅｍｐｏ的將幾個過程很快的過去，特别是人們看見報紙上之徵求女主角，大爲忙亂的一段，更爲佳妙。同樣對於那劇中導演之未婚妻，也　是四五個極短的塲面便描寫她出來了，而關於劇中重要的塲面，却是相當把握住的。</p>
<p>輕鬆活潑，是「我不負卿」之精華，但是這並不是主角愛德門羅做到了的，而飾馬克斯的喬其列陀夫却甚成功。而新進演員安梭珊（ａｎｎ　ｓｏｉｈｏｒｎ）並不見特殊成績，不過平平而巳。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c260">「三姊妹」的尾大莫掉 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 阿蘋</p>
<p>金城開映漁光曲的次日，導演黃金　的李萍倩先生的新作三姊妹也在新光大戲院上演。</p>
<p>那是個從菊池寛的小說「新珠」搬演過來的。記得在同文旁聽的時候，我們的敎授（自然是日人）爲了一位同學提出張○○與菊池寛作品的比較，被他（敎授）大大的將小說商臭駡大頓，簡直不及張資本在中國的地位。我雖没有讀過他的新珠，也不知新珠搬上銀幕後的三姊妹是否和原著經過相當的更改？總之，中國電影界雖在劇本荒的時代，然而將新珠等　類作品搬演過來，呌它在姊妹花盛况之後，怎樣能相提並論呢？</p>
<p>同一導演的黃金榖上演之後，得到了影評人较高持評價，但是那條光明的尾巴將整個劇的力消滅了。不過大家都知道那是無可辦法的事，而現在三姊妹呢？對於大姊的轉變，及二姊的個性，完全是糢糊不淸，最後胡蝶大段說敎而馬一滄被打，至少故事進行到這裏已是大快人心的時候：然而那個剛覺悟的大姊爲了要救二姊妹的未婚夫而就緊接着做出向馬一滄下跪甚至寫伏辯等舉動，雖然給　胡蝶更多的表演機會及小市民觀衆的多打幾次哈哈，我不知導演李先生對於這尾巴中的尾巴不知怎樣向懷抱着比黃金榖更大熱望的觀衆們解釋？</p>

<p>在傑姆斯自殺的悲劇過去之後，有一天，朋在醫院裏收拾着她的衣服雜物，裝在一個小皮箱裏。舒樂絲在旁邊站着看着她，心中未免有些依依不捨。她說：「蜜，我眞捨不得讓你走，我們共甘苦，同患難，巳經過了好幾年了」。朋點着頭看看舒樂絲，可是没有可說的話。她巳經很細地考慮過了。她不久就可以升作市立醫院的總看護了但是麥根娜小姐新近巳經辭職，去作一個新醫院的總看護，她曾向朋接洽過，請她一同到新醫院裏去。朋巳經答應了，不過她先要休息一下，然後再到一個新環境裏，作新的工作，見新的人物，居新的地方丨希望她能改換改換她的心境。在市立醫院裏，麥根娜和朋走了之後，舒樂絲亦就當然的升了總看護的地位，職任和工作的加重，亦可以使她得些精神上的安慰。所以朋情願自己犧牲了總看護的地位、到一個新地方去，讓舒樂絲去做市立醫院的總看護。她和舒樂絲都明白這是頂好的辦法，她們互相看着，很勇敢的笑着。</p>
<p>忽然電話響了丨海特　醫生請朋登去。朋登立卽跑到海特威的公事房裏。海特威坐在寫字　後面，眼睛白瞪瞪地向前直視著。朋登的脚步於將他驚醒了，他連忙站了起來，很懇切對着她說道：「現在你要離開我們了。」朋點着頭，不知道說什麽的好。海特威又說道：「恐</p>
<p>怕我應當向你道賀了。」他說這話，本來是心裏很難受的，可是很奇怪的，朋竟摇着頭說道；「不用。」海特威道；「怎麽啦我以爲┆┆」「你以爲什麽？嫁給葛雷格嗎？不是的。海特威」</p>
<p>眼瞪着她，　然地有些不相信了。他本來是咬緊了牙齒請了她來，預備和她話别，眼看着她跟别人去了。可是現在丨好像爲他重生了一綫的希望，這眞使他驚疑莫定了。他耳朶裏祇聽見很柔媚的聲音說道；「有的時候，一定要經過了大變故，才可以見到一件事情的眞相丨不是的，我不過離開此地去休息一下，以後┆┆」她不說下去了，祇眼看着海特威。</p>
<p>海特　緊張的神經，忽然覺得鬆弛了。他嘴角微微地響着，眼睛露了些笑容。他慢慢地說道；「威尼斯的運河裏，不是還有遊船可以趁了去遊玩嗎？」朋亦報之以微笑，這是一星期之中，她第一次的笑她的面容還顯着極度的疲乏，可是她的眼睛，却發出了新光彩。她微笑着問道；「威尼斯的遊船嗎？那是我總想有機會去坐　趟的」海特威聽了，更加增一倍勇氣，凑到朋的面前，向她懇切地說道；「朋，你說的是眞話嗎？」朋笑了一笑，於是海特威一鼓作氣地說道：「　我們放棄了這個醫院，我們一同去，到歐洲去丨巴黎丨維也纳丨羅馬丨」朋調侃着說道：「一個醫生和一個看護，不要給人家講閒話的嗎？」海特威笑道；「豈有此理我又忘記了！朋，我的心肝，你可以嫁給我嗎？「他們突然互相抱持了，熱烈地吻着，可是他们的快樂，又被電話打斷了。祇聽見海特威對着電話簡道：「什麽？急診？没有别的人？」海特威樹了電話，無可奈何似的呌她等一等。可是朋摇着頭說道：「我不等丨我來帮你的忙。」於是他們二人又忙碌起來了。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Detailed Rules for Connecting Ping and Shenyang Railways Finalized; Technical Aspects Still Require Comprehensive Planning; Yin Tong Visits He in Beiping after Arriving from Tianjin; Representatives of South Manchuria Railway Waiting to Negotiate There <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of connecting the railways has been discussed between representatives from both sides, including Gu Tong and Shibayama.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussions in Dalian, all detailed rules have been finalized. The technical aspects still require comprehensive planning with the contractors. It has been decided that negotiations will be held in Tianjin within this week. In addition to our representative Yin Tong waiting in Tianjin, the Japanese representative Shibayama also went to Tianjin yesterday. At that time, the South Manchuria Railway Company and the International Tourist Bureau will also send representatives to participate. Chen Xiangtao, manager of China Travel Service, will arrive soon to attend. The meeting is scheduled for around the 22nd of this month. The main topic of this meeting will focus on technical aspects, so the participants will also focus on the contractors, such as China Travel Service and the International Tourist Bureau. After this meeting, the railway connection issue will come to an end, waiting only for implementation. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong arrived in Beiping from Tianjin on the night of the 19th. He said that he went to Dalian to meet Shibayama and had reported the progress of the meeting to Huang Fu by telegram, but the reply had not yet arrived. The discussions were still oral and no formal agreement had been signed. The railway connection is a fact and will be implemented from the 1st of next month. The announcement will be made on the 28th of this month. The plans have not been fully finalized. As for the rumors that the Kwantung Army will withdraw from outside the Great Wall and abolish the Tanggu Agreement, he is not yet aware. He will visit He on the 20th to report the results of the meeting in Dalian and will stay in Beiping for about a week. After the detailed rules for the railway connection are agreed upon, they will be announced. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong went to Beiping at 8 PM this afternoon. The departure was still very secretive. It is reported that the South Manchuria Railway has sent six special commissioners who arrived in Beiping on the evening of the 18th to wait for Yin Tong and discuss the procedures before the railway connection. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Ping-Shenyang railway is connected, the establishment of customs at various passes of the Great Wall, postal communication between inside and outside the passes, the deployment of newly formed security forces into the war zone, and the takeover of various small passes of the Great Wall that have not yet been received, will all be discussed by China and Japan in order. The establishment of customs along the Great Wall can be realized after the various passes of the Great Wall are restored to their original state. After the Great Wall area fell into the war zone, the annual loss of tax revenue reached 50 to 60 million, which is a huge loss to the national treasury. We should find a way to plug this loophole. Therefore, the establishment of customs along the Great Wall is to shift the tax collection of the Northeast customs to another location, which is a matter for China itself. Therefore, our side has decided to implement the establishment of customs after the complete takeover of various small passes along the Great Wall. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong and Shibayama will go to Beidaihe for summer vacation in the coming days. They will take the opportunity to talk with the Chinese and Japanese travel agencies about starting an international travel agency. It is said that Yin is going to Beidaihe to carry out the signing procedures for the railway connection plan, which is scheduled to be announced on the 28th of this month. The International Travel Agency is scheduled to be established at the end of the month, and the railway connection will be implemented on July 1st. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong recently went to Dalian to discuss the railway connection with the Japanese authorities. He returned here today. It is expected that the railway will be officially connected on July 1st. Two trains will be prepared by both the Beining Railway and the Fengshan Railway. All travel matters will be handled by China Travel Service and the Japanese Tourist Bureau. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Resolution of the Changli Incident; Return of Fines for Opium <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming came to Beiping to visit Shibayama to negotiate the incident of Japanese surrounding the county government in Changli. The fines for opium seized by the Japanese in that case have been returned. Tao went to Tianjin this morning to visit Yu Hou after the matter was settled, and then went to Cangzhou to inspect the new security forces. He will return to Tangshan after the inspection. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming came to Tianjin from Beiping this afternoon. It has been decided that he will go to Cangzhou on the 21st to inspect the newly formed special police force. Our side still insists that all of the newly formed special police force must be deployed. It is reported that Tao Shangming discussed the incident of the Japanese army surrounding the county government in Changli with Shibayama in Beiping and decided to settle the matter by returning the fine of 1,500 yuan. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A visitor from Lengkou reported that the situation in that area is peaceful. A certain leader of the puppet police force outside the pass is from Hebei Province, and a certain platoon leader of our garrisoned security force inside the pass is from Heishuitan. Because they are both concerned about their hometowns, they have agreed to make big things small and small things disappear. Therefore, the merchants and people near the inside and outside of the pass have benefited from this. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of taking over the Eastern Mausoleums was previously negotiated by Yin Rugeng and Shibayama, but it was shelved due to some interference. Recently, Shibayama went to Changchun to visit the heads of the Kwantung Army, and had thorough discussions on the unresolved issues in the North China war zone. It is reported that the issue of the Eastern Mausoleums has been decided to be returned to our side at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. At that time, the original garrisoned puppet army, the Song Dingming unit, will withdraw north of the Great Wall, and the mausoleum will be guarded by our dispatched security forces. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The issue of the Japanese military police surrounding the Changli county government because of demanding opium fines has been clarified after investigation by Tanaka, the Japanese deputy consul in Tianjin, and has been resolved informally.

<p>(Nanjing) Guoer Zhuoerzhabu of the Mongolian Political Committee telegraphed to Nanjing that recently Japan has adopted an active offensive strategy against Ximeng in Eastern Mongolia, confiscating civilian firearms and disbanding Mongolian soldiers. The Linxi-Duolun highway has now been completed, and a large amount of military supplies have been transported in. The people of Ximeng are under their iron heel and dare not do anything. Only Western Mongolia in Inner Mongolia is intact. If Ximeng is occupied, the gateway to Western Mongolia will be opened, and it may be difficult to preserve it permanently. Inner Mongolia can gather 150,000 laborers. If there are capable generals to unify command and strictly train them, it may not be impossible to resist violence. The Mongolian people feel that unity is necessary to resist foreign aggression, but their strength is weak and they only suffer sacrifices. If the central government can provide sufficient assistance, the Mongolian people will definitely be able to help with national defense. (19th Dispatch)</p>

It is reported that Chiang will attend the Central Political Conference on the 21st and the 21st Central Standing Committee meeting. He will rest in Nanjing for one day and then go to Hangzhou on the 22nd or 23rd to inspect the five-province highway and the recent facilities of the aviation school.

He will also take the opportunity to inspect the tax collection agencies in Shanxi and Sui provinces and return to Nanjing in about two weeks. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing, various central figures visited the official residence of the Military Academy in the past few days. On the 19th, in the morning and afternoon, Chiang met with Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Wang Zhaoming, Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Qun, and others to discuss central plans. It is also intended that Posgari and Li Du also visit Chairman Chiang in the afternoon of the 19th. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wen'gan returned to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 19th and visited Chiang Luo. He said that the people of Hunan Province are honest and simple, which is better than Hubei. Therefore, there are more people who commit minor crimes, but the prison facilities are mostly imperfect due to economic reasons. After the funds are available, they will be improved without any problems. The people of Hubei Province are stronger and more sentenced to imprisonment, and the prisons are more rudimentary. In the future, we should find ways to improve them to emphasize humanity. Shen Jiayi, who was traveling with him, still needs to continue the inspection and did not return together. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wen'gan and Wang Lanjin arrived in Nanjing on the Jihe wheel at 1:00 p.m. on the 19th. After returning to their residences to rest, they went to the ministry to see things and visited President Wang to report on the inspection. According to Luo's reporter, this trip was to inspect Wuhan in Hubei and Changsha, Liling, Shaoyang, Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Ningxiang, and other places in Hunan. Due to the heavy work of the ministry, he returned to Nanjing first. The remaining counties in Hunan and various counties in Hubei were inspected by Shen Jiayi on his behalf. The scenery in Hunan is good and the people are hardworking. There are very few criminals. There are currently only more than 5,000 criminals in the entire province. Most of the civil cases arise from disputes over cemeteries. Both civil and criminal cases are very minor. The courts have few backlogs. In Hubei Province, in addition to personally inspecting Wuhan, the rest was studied through schedules. There are also not many backlogs. Civil cases exceeding 1,000 yuan account for two-tenths, and criminal cases are mostly fraud and theft. The establishment of courts in the two provinces is based on military and political regions as the standard, so there is a disadvantage of reversing the importance. For example, in Qiyang and other counties in Hunan, and Gucheng and Daye in Hubei, there are many lawsuits, with only one trial officer. Yueyang in Hunan, and Xiaogan and Huangpi in Hubei have fewer lawsuits, but they have district courts, which is not economical in terms of funding and talent. The same is true for prisons. The new prisons in Wuchang and Changsha cost hundreds of thousands of yuan and are very large in scale. The old prisons in other counties lack funds for repairs. Not only is there an imbalance, but it also contradicts the original intention of criminal policy to stop crime with punishment. All the reform points have been set opinions, and after Shen returns, they will be handled in a unified manner. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun arrived in Nanjing on the 19th to visit Chiang and report to the central government on the situation in Hubei Province. He needs to consult with the central authorities on the 23rd annual budget due to the succession of the accounting year. Zhang talked about the current situation in Hubei Province: (1) The original teams are now planning to cut redundant staff to save expenses. (2) The financial situation is not sufficient and needs to be reorganized, and it is hoped that the central government can help find ways. As for the Executive Yuan's circular to abolish miscellaneous taxes, there are no miscellaneous taxes to point out in Hubei Province except for those levied by the counties themselves. In the future, they should be strictly removed. (3) Land survey is also the main work of this province in a year. Because the communists in Hubei have not been cleared, there is still a possibility of fleeing into the border of Hubei, so we cannot but take precautions. I will not stay in Nanjing for long and will go to Shanghai to visit the eight inland river vessels ordered by Hubei Province at the Jiangnan Shipyard. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun arrived in Nanjing on the Jihe wheel at 1:00 p.m. on the 19th. According to him, this time he came to Nanjing from Hankou to visit President Wang and Chairman Chiang to report on Hubei's political affairs and to ask for instructions on the 23rd annual political facilities. The revenue and expenditure of the provincial treasury in the 22nd annual meeting was appropriate, and it also repaid hundreds of thousands of previous debts. It also rectified the water police, cut the old and weak, and spent more than 200,000 oceans to purchase eight new ships to strengthen the water police force. The reorganization of inland river merchant ships is also supervised by the shipping companies and local authorities to form a supervisory committee, which is quite effective. The most important thing at present is to reorganize the local teams to reduce the burden on the people. There are no miscellaneous taxes in the provincial treasury, but the various taxes levied for local security and education are inevitably harsh. Now the expenses of the directly affiliated public security agencies are changed to be paid by the provincial government in order to abolish harsh levies. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(A) Review of Reports</p>
<p>(1) Minister Huang of the Ministry of Interior and the ministers and chairmen of various committees reported on the case of the Provisional Regulations on Eliminating Wasteful Customs of Public Officials, which was reviewed together. As a result of the review, the original regulations were changed to the Provisional Regulations on Eliminating Wasteful Weddings, Funerals, and Birthday Banquets of Public Officials, and the articles were amended accordingly.

<p>(3) Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance reported that the goods currently subject to the consolidated tax collected by the central government include cigarettes, smoked tobacco leaves, cotton paper, and their direct components, matches, cement, wheat flour, beer, and foreign wines collected at the factory. The consolidated tax collection regulations or articles clearly stipulate that after one tax is collected at the customs, factory, or place of origin, it is allowed to circulate, and no other donations or taxes may be collected nationwide. However, the provincial and municipal governments have established their own names to re-collect taxes on the spot under the pretext of local needs, such as production and sales taxes, bandit suppression taxes, post-disaster donations, security donations, public welfare donations, and education donations. Although they have been repeatedly requested to stop it, in fact, this suspension is still in effect. It is proposed to declare a fixed chapter and order all provincial and municipal governments to strictly order their subordinates to absolutely not re-collect any donations or taxes on consolidated tax goods under the pretext of local needs, and those who are still collecting them should immediately stop collecting them by a certain date to maintain the tax system and demonstrate seriousness.

Harmful to the public interest of society; 2. Harmful to the source of central revenue; 3. Multiple taxes; 4. Harmful to transportation; 5. For the benefit of one locality, unfair taxation of imports to the locality; 6. The procedures for the organization of local goods transit taxes are also determined in four items: 1. The legal taxes and donations levied by each province and city, the period when the collection began, should be earlier than the Standard for the Division of National and Local Revenue and Expenditure promulgated by the National Government in November 1928. The name of the tax and donation, the purpose, the tax rate, the estimated amount collected, and the month and year of collection should be listed and submitted to the Ministry; 1. The legal taxes and donations levied by each province and city have not been handled in accordance with current laws or decrees. The collection period is after the National Government promulgated the Standard for the Division of National and Local Revenue and Expenditure. The name of the tax and donation, the purpose, the tax rate, the amount collected, and the month and year of collection should be listed and reported to the Ministry for transfer to the legislature for review and approval; 3. When the taxes and donations levied or the tax items increased or decreased by each province and city conflict with the provisions of laws or decrees, the Ministry of Finance may stop and revoke them at any time; 4. The various categories of illegal taxes and donations listed above shall be abolished in stages from July 1, 1934 to the end of October, and how to compensate for them will be determined in another case. If each province and city has special circumstances and cannot comply with the time limit to abolish them completely, they may submit a special case to the Ministry for approval. The resolution was passed and a decree was submitted to the National Government for promulgation, ordering all provincial and municipal governments to comply with it and implement it conscientiously.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Japanese Diplomatic Strategy and Naval Talks <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Respectfully,</p>
<p>Following the postponement of the Geneva Disarmament Conference, those concerned about disarmament issues worldwide have focused their attention on the naval talks among Britain, the United States, and Japan. U.S. representative Davis departed from Paris on the 16th of this month for London to participate in the preliminary negotiations for the naval conference. The specific content of these talks is currently difficult to ascertain with certainty. However, Japan has been preparing for some time. It is reported that the proposals Japan will put forward at the naval conference include: firstly, requiring all countries to reduce tonnage and decrease the size of warships; secondly, breaking away from the past principle of ratios; thirdly, ensuring national defense autonomy; and fourthly, establishing the principle of equality in armaments. These four points can be summarized into two categories: one, demanding that the two major naval powers, Britain and the United States, reduce tonnage and decrease the size of warships; and two, establishing what Japan calls the principle of equality in armaments.</p>
<p>Japan's ambition to dominate East Asia has become increasingly assertive since the September 18th Incident. Furthermore, Japan recognizes that Britain and the United States have inseparable ties to the Far East, both economically and in terms of military strength. However, both are separated by vast oceans. In the event of a conflict in the Far East, they would need more than twice their current forces to achieve victory. Even if Britain and the United States were to genuinely unite, they could, at most, only maintain the status quo. Moreover, with the recent antagonism between Britain and the United States and Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, Japan is eagerly seeking to seize this opportunity to control the hegemony of the Pacific Ocean and extend its influence south of the Equator and west of Hong Kong. Therefore, its call to reduce the existing naval tonnage and decrease the size of warships of all countries is nothing more than an attempt to weaken the offensive capabilities of Britain and the United States. After all, Singapore for Britain and Pearl Harbor for the United States are both more than three thousand nautical miles away from Japan's naval bases. Without massive warships capable of sustaining voyages of ten thousand nautical miles, they would not be able to decisively defeat the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p>If Japan's above proposals are rejected by Britain and the United States, Japan will then resort to its secondary option: the so-called demand for equality in naval armaments. The true meaning of this proposal, in its passive aspect, is that treaty restrictions can weaken the existing naval strength of Britain and the United States. Even in terms of geographical considerations, with the Philippines declaring independence in the near future, the threat from the Sasebo naval base has been largely eliminated. Although Hong Kong serves as the vanguard of the British Navy and Guam as a base for the U.S. Air Force, Japan's naval power, on par with Britain and the United States, is more than capable of destroying these insignificant outposts. Therefore, once the principle of equality in naval armaments is established, Japan's naval strength can be enhanced relatively. At that time, the British Navy will not be able to cross Singapore northward, and the U.S. Navy will not be able to pass Hawaii westward.</p>
<p>If Britain and the United States can truly cooperate harmoniously, they would still be able to unite against Japan. However, the two countries are engaged in intense covert struggles. In South America, there are conflicts over investment relationships, and domestically, there are disputes over war debts. Japan is exploiting these weaknesses, abandoning its usual anti-American rhetoric. On the one hand, it is touting Hirota's so-called moral diplomacy, establishing the Hull-Hirota exchange of notes. On the other hand, it is sending Konoe Fumimaro to the United States to ease tensions in various ways, expressing its sincere intentions. Thirdly, it is offering the opening of (Manchuria) as a significant lure. In its dealings with the United States, Japan hopes to reduce negative sentiments. In its dealings with Britain, Japan is intensifying its precautions. Britain's Asian policy prioritizes stabilizing India's economic and political relations, with the development of China as a secondary concern. This intention has become particularly evident since the Great War. Its deepest concern is preventing Soviet expansion eastward and maintaining the current state of the Far Eastern market. However, Britain can only hold India and cannot control the overall situation in the Far East, providing Japan with an opportunity to exert pressure. The British are aware of this, and therefore, before the naval preliminary talks, they have had to accommodate Japan in every way to show goodwill. Such is the relationship between Britain, the United States, and Japan.</p>
<p>Japan intends to use its divisive strategy to turn Anglo-American cooperation into empty talk. However, Britain and the United States are both major powers of world capitalism, with the urgent task of expanding markets. Ensuring naval superiority is also necessary for expanding markets. How could they not consider this carefully? Based on this reasoning, the drama of naval competition will inevitably be replayed in the future. Moreover, after the September 18th Incident, the balance of power in the Far East was long ago disrupted. Any attempt to adjust it will inevitably lead to numerous disputes. Those in the know believe that the future of the three-nation naval conference is no less bleak than that of the Geneva Disarmament Conference. Is there no reason for this?</p>
<h3 id="e17">Sino-British Border Dispute: Our Suggestion to Form a Committee for Resolution, British Government Still Has No Reply <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Chinese government has formally suggested to London the formation of a committee to resolve the border dispute of the past forty years. Britain has yet to reply. However, the experiences of the past forty years may not encourage the British government's interest in the Chinese suggestion. The land disputed between China and Britain is located between Burma and Yunnan Province. The plan to establish a mixed commission to mediate the long-standing dispute depends on the findings of investigations by the two governments. Therefore, its success is uncertain. In February, Chinese Minister to Britain Guo Taiqi sent a note to the British Foreign Office, stating that a British exploration team from Burma had armed and intruded into Chinese territory, undermining Chinese sovereignty. However, Britain denied this claim. According to the Chinese government, Burmese mining surveyors, accompanied by armed personnel, crossed the disputed area between Burma and Yunnan Province last winter to explore for gold, tin, and other minerals. The exploration team built bridges along the way, penetrating deep into Chinese territory. The British expressed doubts about the accusations made by the Chinese people, stating that the exploration team had ceased its activities before reaching Chinese territory. The British sent a note to China stating that when the exploration team departed, it had been instructed (not to enter the disputed area). The new British Minister to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, denied that the exploration team had disregarded this instruction. The Chinese government then instructed the consul in Rangoon to conduct an investigation. The Chinese government's suggestion to establish a joint committee to permanently resolve the border dispute is due to this incident. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

I have telegraphed to request Wanping County to jointly investigate. However, the suburbs of Beiping are vast, and police have long been deployed to maintain order for the locals and foreigners. I have repeatedly ordered the Public Security Bureau to pay attention to protection. Yu Jinhe said, although the Missionary En case occurred within Wanping County, it is adjacent to the suburbs of the city. I have instructed my subordinates to earnestly cooperate in the arrest and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice. However, as of today, there are still no clues. There are many bandits in that area who constantly take advantage of the border between the province and the city to carry out robberies. The bandits who shot and killed Missionary En are likely bandits hiding in that area who are involved in tomb raiding. Moshikou is located at the provincial-municipal boundary with the village of Shanhuan, and has long been a stronghold for bandits. Due to the limited number of police in the city, I requested the garrison to send troops to be stationed there, which has been approved. In the future, the security of that area will be jointly maintained by the military and police. (Special Telegram, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) Although British newspapers have recently predicted that the United States will close its naval base in Manila, according to statements obtained by Reuters today from several senior U.S. officials, the U.S. naval policy in the Far East will remain unchanged for the time being. It is reported that the United States has not made a decision to abandon the Manila naval base, nor is there any indication that it will withdraw the U.S. Asiatic Fleet stationed in the Philippines and abandon its naval bases throughout the Far East. The naval talks currently being held in London and the naval conference to be convened next year will affect the U.S. naval policy in the Far East, and this policy will depend on Japan's demands regarding naval ratios. The U.S. Asiatic Fleet can only be regarded as a police force, and is by no means capable of attacking others. The United States is indeed preparing to withdraw from the Philippine Islands, but the independence act stipulates the retention of the fleet stationed in the Philippines and supply stations, pending a decision by a conference to be convened two years after full independence. Full independence of the Philippines will be achieved in ten or twelve years. Therefore, the future of the Philippines as a naval base cannot be definitively decided until 1950. The United States has been developing Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands as its main base in the Pacific for many years, and has never planned to establish a strong naval base east of the Hawaiian Islands. According to the Washington Treaty, the United States agrees to maintain the status quo regarding naval bases in the Pacific, except for Hawaii. Therefore, Japan has obtained a guarantee that it will be protected from attack by the United States and Britain. Without a well-defended base, the United States or Britain can never wage an offensive war in the Far East with any hope of success. (Reuters Telegram, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) The U.S. delegation went to the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street today to exchange preliminary views on the scope of the 1935 naval conference. The real work will begin on Wednesday. Those who went to Downing Street this morning were Davis, the chief U.S. representative to the naval conference, Bingham, the U.S. Ambassador to London, Atherton, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in London, and Admiral Leahy. The British officials who met them were Prime Minister MacDonald, Naval Minister Monsell, and Craigie, Head of the American Department of the Foreign Office. The meeting lasted about ninety minutes. It is reported that the U.S. delegation did not want to make suggestions, but only wanted to hear Britain's opinions and consider them. The first step will be relatively simple, merely selecting the date and location of the conference. The location is expected to be London. Once the date and location are decided, several technical issues may be considered, such as tonnage, vessels, and gun sizes. These are the main events, and the parties intend to exchange views in a timely manner to study them before the general conference. Political issues, such as ratios and the Pacific situation, are not to be discussed. The preliminary naval talks in London will all be bilateral in nature. After the Anglo-American discussions are completed, the British authorities will meet with the Italian delegation, and then with the Japanese delegation. Although France has not yet formally responded, it is expected that it will accept Britain's application. As each bilateral discussion proceeds, the information discussed will be communicated to all countries involved in the naval conference. It is now hoped that the results of the preliminary talks between the countries can clarify some points and make compromise easier to achieve, and to clear away all difficulties so that a successful agenda for the general conference can be drafted. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The U.S. delegation held its first preparatory talks with the British authorities on Downing Street today for the 1935 naval conference, but the U.S. representatives were still unable to discern the position taken by the British government. The two sides have not yet exchanged views on general issues. However, the U.S. representatives will certainly oppose Japan's demands. What Japan is demanding is: (1) the implementation of total equality in naval tonnage; (2) each country should be able to allocate its due total tonnage according to its national needs. Therefore, the method of separately restricting the types of vessels according to the London Treaty will be abolished. Now that the talks between Britain and the United States have just begun, their direction will be greatly influenced by Japan's naval policy. According to the Japanese newspaper (Nichinichi Shimbun), Japan's intentions are roughly as follows: (1) demand that all countries reduce total tonnage and reduce the size of warships; (2) abolish the original 5:5:3 ratio of capital ships for Britain, the United States, and Japan, and adopt the principle of total tonnage limitation; (3) establish the principle of equality in armaments; (4) each country has the right to decide on its own national defense needs. The U.S. delegation cannot agree to the latter three demands, especially the second and fourth, because the U.S. representatives believe that doing so would be equivalent to absolute equality for the navies of all countries, and would give Japan the power to build any type of warship. Japan's naval sphere of activity is limited to the Pacific Ocean, while the United States must consider both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The British Navy must be distributed among the seven oceans. Therefore, this theoretical equality is absolutely unequal in practice. The U.S. representatives will discuss this viewpoint with the British authorities. Therefore, the scope of the discussion will undoubtedly exceed procedural issues. The Japanese delegation will not arrive for another month, and the preliminary talks will be limited to strictly bilateral talks (i.e., Anglo-American, Anglo-Japanese, separate talks, rather than trilateral Anglo-American-Japanese talks). However, the Anglo-American parties will definitely consider the issues that the Japanese representatives will raise after their arrival. The British government's attitude has not yet been determined, and it is currently impossible to know. Today's meeting was merely routine in nature. The U.S. representatives are still taking a wait-and-see approach. Norman Davis will begin contacting Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira on Wednesday morning. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>(London) A certain prominent figure recently returned from travels to both Soviet and German territories. An interviewer from the North-China Daily News visited him. According to him, the Russians now believe that there is a secret understanding between Germany and Japan to jointly attack Soviet Russia in the spring of 1935. By that time, the German withdrawal from the League of Nations will have become effective, and military preparations will also be complete. The official also claimed that Germany's goal is to seize the Baltic territories. The Germans are currently spending heavily on propaganda in that area and are also planning to occupy Ukraine, as that land is fertile and produces abundant resources, which would allow Germany to become self-sufficient. The German's second target is France, followed by Britain, because they attribute their defeat in the Great War entirely to Britain. However, Japan is no longer as confident of victory in the attack on Russia as it was before. The Russians are also very concerned about the recent meeting between the leaders of Italy and Germany, but they are very suspicious of the outcome of the meeting, believing that Hitler is merely a puppet. The official concluded by saying that Soviet Russia is now able to supply its own war materials and has even begun to produce nickel. (Special Dispatch from the North-China Daily News, 8th)</p>

<p>(London) French Foreign Minister Barthou departed today for the capitals of Romania and Yugoslavia to consolidate France's Eastern Alliance. The issues he will discuss with the two countries will be the same as those discussed by the leaders of Italy and Germany in Venice recently. Barthou's trip is a result of his recent visit to Warsaw. Before his departure, Barthou publicly denied that France intends to encircle Germany. However, there is no doubt that France wants to resist Germany's rearmament.

<p>Today, the Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" in Rome published a lengthy article on the recent meeting between Hitler and Mussolini. The newspaper stated that during the discussions between the two leaders, there was no suggestion of concluding a separate treaty. The purpose of their meeting was not to drastically alter the map of Europe. The primary objective was to consolidate and ensure lasting peace in Europe. Mussolini's desire for peace is well-known, and Hitler has repeatedly stated Germany's permanent renunciation of Alsace-Lorraine and Polish Silesia, which proves Germany's intention for peace. Furthermore, the two countries' equal opposition to governments of collusion between nations is also a manifestation of their desire for peace. On the other hand, both Germany and Italy have recognized that the re-establishment of a fundamental balance in Europe is an urgent matter, and the establishment of a fundamental balance requires the firm recognition of the rights of all countries. Regarding disarmament, the newspaper stated that Germany's attitude is clear: it will not return to Geneva until equal rights are established. The newspaper continued, "Among the major issues of establishing European equilibrium and cooperating with Germany, the Soviet Russian issue is the most important. Relations between Germany and Russia are currently extremely cold." To limit this coldness, the Soviet Union, after the Venice meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, sent a proposal to Berlin to conclude an Eastern Locarno Treaty, requesting that Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia join at the same time. Germany immediately rejected this proposal. This fact is unrelated to German-Soviet harmony but is a resistance to a collusive government. The restoration of relations and the avoidance of disputes between Germany and Russia are urgently needed to maintain peace in Europe." (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times published an editorial commenting on the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, stating that "The comments of Italian newspapers show that Mussolini is somewhat disappointed with Hitler's excessive idealism and lack of understanding of European realities. The Italian Prime Minister himself is a highly pragmatic person. Therefore, Italian newspapers do not believe that Mussolini can approve of a National Socialist Party member as the Prime Minister of Austria, because the impractical National Socialist Party's rule over Austria is unlikely to be endorsed by the pragmatic Mussolini." The New York Times described the recent speeches given by the Italian Prime Minister in St. Mark's Square and by the German Chancellor Hitler in Gera. The Italian Prime Minister urged the Italian people to make further sacrifices to defend their country and prevent invasion, while Hitler also advised the German people to make further sacrifices to maintain the National Socialist Party's politics so that it can endure. The New York Times said that such similar speeches must be welcomed by the self-respecting German people. Recently, Germany's suspension of foreign debt payments has caused opposition from Britain, France, and other countries, leading to criticism of Germany for poor financial management, which is a gift from Hitler. No matter how well German newspapers propagandize, they cannot completely hide the facts from the German people regarding the criticism of Germany's debt reliance. Now, hearing the Italian Prime Minister and the German Chancellor make similar statements, the German people can at least comfort themselves. After Germany suspended foreign debt payments, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany officially protested to the German government, stating that its treatment of U.S. bondholders was inappropriate. The suspension of foreign debt payments, as a whole, is a severe lesson for Germany. For Hitler's sake, instead of dreaming of modifying the borders of other countries and world alliances, it is better to concentrate on managing its internal affairs." (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) German Deputy Chancellor von Papen's extremely courageous public criticism of the National Socialist Party system at the University of Marburg has attracted national attention. Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels, after returning from Warsaw, immediately ordered the ban on the publication of Papen's speech. The first edition of today's Frankfurter Zeitung, which carried the speech, has been confiscated. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>German Deputy Chancellor von Papen, at the University of Marburg here, delivered a speech on domestic policy issues, criticizing the current German system, which is quite noteworthy. Papen first praised Chancellor Hitler and his accomplishments, and then stated that at this crucial juncture, brave and loyal words are the responsibility that should be borne for the German revolution. Unfortunately, most German newspapers are unable to bear this responsibility at present. Papen also said that the current German government is fully powerful and strong. Appropriate and loyal criticism should not hinder the authority of the government. However, it is a pity that the general revolutionary youth regard those conservative elements who conscientiously fulfill their critical responsibilities as reactionaries. The reason why a one-party system is necessary is that it is sufficient to change the original system. If the system has been changed, and emerging superior elements have taken up important positions, then the existence of a one-party system is not essential. Referring to the division of religious factions in Germany, Papen asked those who advocate unification in Germany to think again. It must be known that Christian doctrine is the potential force of all Western thought. Will Germany be a new Germany of Christianity, or will it perish by indulging in the idealism of false religions? This depends on a firm struggle to determine. The German people have no right to transcend all Christian people. If so, the cultural trend is different from the daily experience of the German revolution, but at present, there is a mixture of the two. It is a slander to believe that culturalism is spiritual life. It is not only that the criteria for judging with human freedom and equality are the original concepts of Christianity and the 日　　nation, which is by no means a manifestation of liberalism, because justice is the basis of the country. In addition, Papen also criticized the false concept of worshiping figures. In conclusion, he said that we should not regard all criticisms as malicious, and we should not regard the dispirited and disappointed patriots as enemies of the country. If not, the future of the country will suffer major sacrifices. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Deputy Chancellor von Papen delivered a speech on domestic policy issues at the University of Marburg yesterday, criticizing German domestic policy. This incident has aroused a strong impression in political circles. The government has ordered the press not to publish Papen's speech. People have made various speculations about Papen's speech, some saying that Papen warned against certain members of the National Socialist Party being too radical, and others saying that Propaganda Minister Goebbels' extreme National Socialism has aroused concerns among conservatives. Papen's speech is tantamount to challenging Goebbels. In short, Papen's publicly expressed views can at least be regarded as increasingly distant from the trends of the leaders of the National Socialist Party. Papen has a close relationship with Hitler, but now he is criticizing National Socialism so much, which is unprecedented. Some people say that a serious conflict has occurred within the German government, which is by no means true. However, it is indeed a fact that the unity of the German government is becoming increasingly disintegrated. Therefore, we should pay attention to the evolution of German domestic policy. Even if the current tense situation temporarily subsides, Papen's speech shows that there are two opposing theories in the National Socialist Party government. We should always pay attention to this situation. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Communist Party rioted again in Toulouse last night. The street fighting in the city only stopped this morning. The intensity of the battle is reminiscent of the Paris riots in February. This riot is no different from ordinary riots. The cause of the riot was that the Communist Party intended to hold retaliatory demonstrations and planned to break into the meeting place of the opposition party, but was blocked by the police. The Communist Party then used its terror tactics, and none of the windows of nearby shops were spared. Furniture was stolen, cars were overturned, and the Communist Party then attacked the police's tanks. Two police patrol cars were also overturned and burned. The Communist Party fought more and more fiercely, throwing torches. The cavalry and police who came in a steady stream seemed to be able to control the overall situation at times. They planned to occupy the city center in the dark and set up obstacles. The Communist Party also attacked the police with bricks and pistols. By one o'clock in the middle of the night, a total of forty people were injured and twenty people were arrested. The riots were still in progress this morning. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) Before the meeting of the Steering Committee of the last Disarmament Conference in Geneva, it was rumored that Turkey would raise the demand to revise the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, according to which military equipment could not be set up on both sides of the Dardanelles Strait. Now Turkey intends to request the cancellation of this provision so that it can reinstall defensive works. In early June, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü met with British Foreign Secretary Simon several times in Geneva, and it was heard that he had abandoned the previous proposal and no longer made the above request. Recently, the Daily Telegraph reported that Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov was greatly disappointed when he heard that the Turkish Foreign Minister had canceled the previous proposal. The reason is that Litvinov's original plan was to contain Britain in two steps: first, the Soviet Union would conclude a Mediterranean naval convention with other countries, and second, it would revise the treaty restricting military equipment in the straits. However, the Soviet Union's (diplomatic buying behavior) trick, wanting to make Turkey fall into its trap to plot against Britain, was rejected by Turkey. The relations between Britain and Turkey are very good. If Turkey is fooled, it will damage the friendly relations between Britain and Turkey. People generally approve of Turkey's attitude in this matter. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The State Department today instructed U.S. Ambassador Dodd in Germany to protest certain measures taken by Germany to suspend debt payments, claiming that these measures are detrimental to U.S. bondholders. Ambassador Dodd was ordered to notify the German government, stating that the United States cannot approve of Germany's poor treatment of U.S. bondholders. According to today's news, German Ambassador to the United States Luther will soon return to his country to report to the government on the U.S.-German business negotiations. These negotiations are roughly conducted in accordance with the U.S.'s recently passed reciprocal tariff measures. It is said that Ambassador Luther also has a report on (a certain economic situation). According to the German government's notice to the United States on March 31, it could not repay the due war debt of 50 million yuan, but the due interest of 1.2 million yuan would be paid as scheduled three days later. At that time, Prime Minister Hull stated to German Ambassador Luther that the U.S. government had no right to change the debt terms, saying that this matter must be voted on by Congress. Today, Congress's attitude towards Germany has been determined, that is, if Germany does not pay this debt, the United States will also stop paying for the wartime losses that should be compensated to the German people. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, the London Times published a Washington communication, stating the opinions of U.S. officials on the recent proposal by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer to establish a clearing house between Britain and Germany. The communication said that after Germany's suspension of indemnity clearance, European creditor countries rose up to criticize, but this state of chaos has also aroused considerable resentment in the United States, because European creditor countries, on the one hand, condemned Germany's disregard for credit and delayed debt payments, and on the other hand, refused to pay the due U.S. war debts for the same reason. The United States has no plans for coercive or retaliatory actions against Germany, but if the establishment of a clearing house between Britain and Germany is detrimental to the United States, the United States will inevitably have to protest to London through normal diplomatic channels.

<p>(Tokyo) After investigating the case of the British professor Backden, a professor at the Communist First High School, who was allegedly tortured to death, the police department has learned the details of the crime. He was released on bail on May 21 and handed over to the British Consul General in Yokohama. Afterwards, he suddenly disappeared, and it is rumored that he has fled overseas or has gone underground. The police should strictly search for him and ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for assistance. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately telegraphed officials stationed in China and North America to search together. If it is determined that he has indeed fled overseas, then what measures will be taken against the British Consul General in Yokohama who led him? (Dentsu Telegram, 19th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The second session of the 73rd U.S. Congress was adjourned yesterday at midnight. The funds and powers granted to President Roosevelt by this Congress are unprecedented in scope. During the congressional recess, the President can transform the economic future of the United States according to his personal views. The Senate was originally scheduled to adjourn last Saturday, but because the agenda was not completed, it was postponed until 11:05 last night. Although the House of Representatives had completed its work long ago, it also adjourned indefinitely at 11:43 due to the Senate's affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Establishment of Nine Important Bills <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>In addition to approving an unprecedented amount of 5.2 billion in appropriations, this session also passed many bills that have a significant impact on the lives and economy of the American people, regardless of gender, age, or social status. The most important ones include the following nine items:</p>
<p>(1) National Exchange Control Act, which stipulates that all public debt transactions are under the management of the federal government. (2) Reciprocal Tariff Act, which authorizes the President to directly conclude trade reciprocity treaties with various countries. (3) Gold Dollar Devaluation Act, which stipulates the method of dollar devaluation and allows the national gold reserves to be nationalized. (4) Silver Act, which stipulates that the national treasury reserves must be equal to 25% of the total value of the national currency. (5) Federal Telecommunications Act, which stipulates that all national telephones, telegraphs, and wireless radio are under central management and are handled by a special government department. (6) Air Mail Act, which stipulates air mail contracts and restrictions on subsidies. (7) Cotton Production Restriction Act, which stipulates the method of taxation for exceeding the limit. (8) Philippine Independence Act. (9) Vinson Naval Act, which allocates funds to expand the navy to the extent permitted by the treaty.</p>
<p>The Harmony of Deliberations is Unprecedented Before Congress adjourned, the last important bill that the industry had been waiting for for a long time was the housing improvement bill, which allocated 200 million yuan for the construction and improvement of residences. After a brief debate, it was passed. In addition, the Railway Labor Act, which stipulates that labor unions established by companies are illegal and guarantees the right of railway workers to negotiate with unions, was also sent to the White House for the President to sign. After all matters were completed, members of both houses gave farewell speeches. The harmonious atmosphere was rare in party parliaments. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>The Closing Ceremony Breaks the Old Tradition (Washington)</p>
<p>In the hours before Congress adjourned, the members were all happy, which was very different from the tense struggle a few days ago. When the House of Representatives discussed the joint review report of the two houses on housing cases, senators gathered in groups, chatting and laughing. Even political enemies were like friends. The many elegantly dressed female guests in the auditorium were especially a decoration of the happy situation. The House of Representatives finally decided not to hold the old tradition of parades at the closing ceremony, so only a military band played the national anthem at the midnight closing of Congress, and the closing ceremony was completed.

<p>The Signing of the Silver Case is Suddenly Postponed (Washington) The White House announced tonight that President Roosevelt had signed the Silver Act, but after an hour and a half, the press release was cancelled, claiming that it would be signed tomorrow night.

<h3 id="e39">The Russian-Japanese Negotiations on the Incident of a Fake Ship Breaking into Russian Territorial Waters <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The following TASS news was published here: Soviet Consul General in Harbin, Slavsky, delivered a statement to (Manchukuo) Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shimamura, in response to the latter's explanation of the (Manchukuo) ship incident on the Heilongjiang River.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Japanese Note <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>On June 5, Japanese Ambassador to Russia Ota submitted a note to Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Stomonyakov on this matter. In the note, Ota opposed Slavsky's statement, citing his statement during his conversation with Stomonyakov on May 22. The statement said that the DeCheng ship's approach to the Soviet riverbank was due to the ship being shot by bandits from the Manchurian riverbank. At the same time, Ota pointed out that during his conversation with Stomonyakov, he said that "when the (Manchukuo) ship was dodging the bandits' attack and retreating to the Soviet territorial waters, it was shot at by the Soviet riverside." This conversation is true. Ota added that his conversations on this issue did not involve deaths or injuries, while the statement of the (Manchukuo) diplomatic representative stated that "this death was the result of the Soviet riverside shooting." Ota believed that this part of his conversation with Deputy Foreign Commissar Stomonyakov on May 22 had been misused. He also expressed his concerns (that this would create a wrong impression on the general public) and requested that appropriate steps be taken. Ota reiterated that he did not object to the publication of this note.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Soviet Text <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>On June 10, Stomonyakov issued a note in response to the Japanese ambassador's note. (I only received a copy of the note No. 112 of June 5 on June 7, and I was shocked to read its contents.) The communiqué of the Soviet Consul General in Harbin's oral protest to the (Manchukuo) Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs published in the newspapers on June 4 clearly did not have any statement that would allow us to conclude that anyone's opinion that the DeCheng ship was shot by the Manchukuo riverbank, resulting in the death and injury of several people on board, was Your Excellency's opinion. In fact, the only thing Your Excellency talked about in the statement by the Soviet Consul General in Harbin was this, that is, according to your statement to me on May 22, the DeCheng ship's approach to the Soviet riverbank was caused by being shot by bandits from the Manchukuo riverbank. In the note of June 5, Your Excellency reiterated the main purpose of Your Excellency's statement on May 22, but there is still something unclear, that is, which statement in the statement of the Soviet Consul General in Harbin (to the (Manchukuo) Minister of Foreign Affairs) does Your Excellency wish to correct, and which does Your Excellency wish to deny?</p>
<p>(Finally, Your Excellency is very dissatisfied with the fact that the Diplomatic Committee instructed the Soviet Consul General in Harbin to quote Your Excellency's statement. I do not want to elaborate on the criticism of this quote in Your Excellency's note, but I must tell Your Excellency that our conversation on May 22 was not a private conversation and had no confidential nature. At the same time, Your Excellency gave me this incident on the DeCheng ship, which is the current tense situation in the Far East, (this is Your Excellency's opinion), and did not make such reservations that Your Excellency's report cannot be quoted even when making statements to third parties.</p>
<p>(In Your Excellency's note of June 5, he also expressed displeasure with the fact that the newspapers published a statement quoting certain sentences Your Excellency made in our conversation on May 22. Here I should forgive myself for reminding Your Excellency of the following facts, that is, the main content of this conversation has been published in detail by the Tokyo newspapers, and quoted the report of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs representative. Unfortunately, the content of the May 22 conversation recorded by the Tokyo newspapers is very inaccurate and erroneous. Not only are the points I have stated distorted in tone and content, but also Your Excellency has never said it, and it is also referred to as Your Excellency's statement. For example, the (Japanese Daily News) published on May 26 that a Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said that when we talked on May 22, Your Excellency gave me a memorandum, which contained (The Soviet authorities' attitude towards the Japanese consulates in Blagoveshchensk and Khabarovsk is brutal and dishonest). I don't need to tell Your Excellency that this news is purely fabricated, and at the same time, there is no reason in the memorandum to produce this news. Japanese public opinion's information on diplomatic negotiations is inexcusable, and at the same time, it can never be a method to promote healthy relations between the two countries. I hope Your Excellency agrees with this point. In the past, the Tokyo newspapers have always reported inaccurately on certain issues discussed and the diplomatic negotiations conducted by our two countries' representatives. My predecessor, Sokolnikov, has repeatedly urged Your Excellency to pay attention to this. At this moment, I am again asking Your Excellency to take effective steps to stop these actions, because it is clearly detrimental to our two countries' friendship.)</p>
<p>(As for Your Excellency's desire to publish a denial in the note of June 5, or to publish the full text of Your Excellency's note, but from the above points of view, I really don't know what the object of the denial is, and I don't know what the reason for the publication is. However, if Your Excellency renews the request after receiving this note, I will ask the media in my country to publish Your Excellency's note. However, at that time, they will also publish my reply.)</p>
<p>After this note was issued, the Japanese side did not request that Ota's note of June 5 be published in the Soviet newspapers. However, on June 11, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs published its note in the Japanese newspapers, and the Japanese newspapers did not publish Stomonyakov's reply, and there was no news about the fact that the Japanese ambassador received this reply.

<h3 id="e46">Case of the Robbery of the Shuntian Steamer: Qingdao Fleet Ordered to Set Sail <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The British Taikoo Company's Shuntian steamer departed from Tanggu at 3 PM on the 17th, loaded with passengers and cargo for export. At 6:30 PM, 180 li outside Dagu, a large group of dozens of sea bandits suddenly emerged from the lower deck, holding guns and restraining the chief officer and chief engineer. They dropped anchor in the sea, carried out a search, and gathered all valuables together. They also kidnapped five Western passengers, including a Japanese man named Yamamoto, two British soldiers, Mr. Nickell, the general manager of the British Manufacturers Life Insurance Company in Shanghai, and more than twenty Chinese people. At 8 PM, some sea bandits arrived in a sailboat, disembarked, and fled. Before leaving, they destroyed the ship's radio station and equipment, preventing the ship from sending out distress signals. On the 18th, after repairs, the ship barely managed to sail to Yantai and reported to the British and American navies, requesting them to send warships for suppression. (Special Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A foreigner in Beiping received a telegram from the British consulates in Tianjin and Yantai stating that the British Taikoo Company's Xin Shuntian left Tanggu for Shanghai at 3 PM on the 18th. At about 4 AM on the 19th, while passing through the waters near Sang Island, a large number of pirates were suddenly discovered on the ship. They first fired three blank shots as a warning, and at the same time, divided into groups to monitor the passengers' movements. Another group of bandits, holding guns, went to the engine room and destroyed the radio. The ship's third officer, a British man, was shot by the bandits and was in critical condition. After everything was settled, they began searching and robbing. Finally, more than twenty Chinese male and female passengers, three Western passengers, three foreign officers of the ship, and one Japanese passenger were kidnapped and taken away on a small boat prepared in advance, riding the waves. The Xin Shuntian steamer arrived in Yantai this afternoon and has telegraphed Beijing and Shanghai for assistance. The Qingdao fleet has been ordered to set sail to patrol the location of the incident and suppress the pirates. (Special Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Yantai) The sea bandits who robbed the Shuntian ship, besides searching and robbing the passengers' belongings, did not harass them. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, before leaving the ship, the bandits even treated the foreign passengers to coffee and pastries. The pirates kidnapped a total of twenty-six people, including twenty Chinese, five British, and one Japanese, named Yamamoto, who was said to be related to the Japanese army. There were also several American women among the passengers, but fortunately, none of them were kidnapped. Among the foreign passengers, besides the British, Americans, and the Japanese man Yamamoto, there were no other nationalities. The foreign passengers highly praised the captain, Christiansen, and other crew members, who, even in a very difficult situation, did their best to assist the passengers. The bandits apparently disguised themselves as passengers in Tanggu to board the ship. According to the wife of Mr. Houchong, the deputy manager of the Asia Petroleum Company's Tianjin branch, when the robbery occurred, she and her two children were fast asleep when they were suddenly awakened by gunfire. Then, they heard a lot of noise. Soon, several bandits entered the room and searched for money, clothing, and jewelry. Not long after, several female passengers and three children were confined by the bandits in the second-class dining room. They did not leave the room on Sunday. The bandits only chose strong young men to kidnap. Many passengers praised them. The Japanese man Yamamoto, who was kidnapped, was said to be related to the Tianjin Japanese army. However, his behavior was suspicious. His full name and other details are unknown. Yamamoto's ticket was purchased by a Japanese military officer named Nagura Tomo, through the Tianjin China Travel Service. Nagura wore Chinese clothing and stayed at the Beiyang Hotel with Yamamoto. According to the manager of the hotel, Nagura often stayed at the hotel and was said to be related to the Japanese army. This time, he used the name Zang Liansheng (transliteration) to register in the guest book. The hotel often bought tickets for Nagura to go to Tanggu, Tangshan, Shanhaiguan, and other places. On the day Yamamoto took the Shuntian steamer to Yantai, Nagura also went to Tangshan. When the Japanese authorities heard the news of the Japanese man Yamamoto's kidnapping, they immediately dispatched a cruiser from Dalian at full speed to Yantai, which arrived at the port at noon today. Among the kidnapped Chinese, there was Shen Tianlin (transliteration), who served as the Minister of Interior during Wu Peifu's administration. According to reliable sources, the mail and cargo carried by the Shuntian ship were not touched by the bandits. Reuters learned from reliable sources that the five civilian boats used by the bandits, two were registered in Yantai and three were registered in Tianjin. This afternoon at 5 PM, the condition of the Shuntian ship's third officer, Mr. Ross, has not changed. Mr. Ross is still lying in the hospital, receiving careful treatment from doctors. Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu has responded to the urgent telegram from the Chinese Commissioner of the Maritime Customs Service and dispatched a detachment of provincial troops from Wuding to Lijin, a county located about thirty miles inland from the mouth of the Yellow River, believing that the bandits are advancing towards the territory of Lijin County. According to reports, the foreign passengers kidnapped from the Shuntian ship, in addition to the Japanese Yamamoto, include Mr. Nicoll from Shanghai, British Naval Major Field, and Luce. The Shuntian ship's second officer, Brandt, age 27, and third-class engineer Watson, age 31. (Reuters Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Yantai) The Shuntian ship, escorted by the British destroyer HMS Witch, arrived here at 5 AM this morning. The news of the ship's robbery spread throughout the area last night. Therefore, many foreigners, including some who were vacationing here, gathered at the pier at dawn to wait for the ship's arrival. Ross, who was injured on the ship, was treated by the British destroyer HMS Witch last night. Today, after the ship docked, with the assistance of the American naval personnel here, Ross was carried ashore and sent to the American hospital. Ross suffered a serious gunshot wound, but his condition is stable. Admiral Dreyer, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, has telegraphed the American naval authorities here to thank them for the assistance provided to Ross by the American naval personnel. The foreign passengers on the Shuntian ship included five women, some children, and seven men. Mr. and Mrs. Lyle, the British Consul-General in Qingdao, were also among them. In addition, there was the Japanese man Yamamoto. According to the people on the ship, the women were all calm and brave. Mrs. Warren, Mrs. Learmouth, and Mrs. Lyle all locked themselves in their rooms. Although the bandits repeatedly shouted and demanded that they open the doors, they did not break out. Mrs. Houchong was especially calm. Captain Christiansen of the ship told a Reuters reporter that the incident occurred at 10:30 PM on Sunday. There were about thirty bandits in total, all carrying weapons. Several bandits first entered the radio room, captured the two operators, and imprisoned them in the smoking room. Mr. Christie heard a lot of noise outside and rushed out of his room to investigate. As soon as he left the room, he was captured by three armed bandits and also imprisoned in the smoking room. At that time, the helmsman was the third officer, Mr. Ross, who was attacked by the bandits and suffered a serious gunshot wound. Two other crew members and two engineers were also arrested at the same time and sent to the smoking room. Several bandits guarded them in that room until 5 PM on Sunday. During this time, the helmsman was the third pirate, who was obviously an experienced navigator and steered the ship towards the mouth of the Yellow River. There, five civilian boats were docked. It is not possible to determine whether they were in collusion with the pirates. However, in any case, these five boats were requisitioned by the pirates. The Shuntian ship ran aground on a soft sandbar. Fortunately, after the pirates left the ship on Sunday afternoon, the ship floated again. The pirates did not cause any physical damage to the ship, nor did they damage the radio. Therefore, a distress signal could still be sent out at 5:30 PM. The cargo on the ship was not taken by the pirates. However, the passengers' suitcases and luggage were all robbed. All clothes, jewelry, money, and valuables were looted. Even the jewelry worn by Mr. Houchong's children was robbed. The bandits took the opportunity to change into Chinese clothes and discard their original old clothes on the ship. Some of them wore a mixture of Chinese and Western clothes. They seemed particularly interested in eyeglasses. Several pirates told the Shuntian ship's comprador that they were Shandong smugglers and that because the customs inspection was too strict, they robbed the ship to retaliate, causing trouble for the government. Before leaving the ship, the pirates announced that they wanted to kidnap four foreign passengers and two crew members. The captain asked the pirates to draw lots to decide who to kidnap, but the pirates refused. They then chose Mr. Nicoll, Major Field, Major Luce, Mr. Yamamoto, and the crew members Brandt and Watson. After the ship ran aground at the mouth of the Yellow River, the above six foreigners were driven into a civilian boat. The pirates initially planned to kidnap the Shuntian's chief officer, but because the captain told them that he needed the chief officer to help him sail the ship, the pirates changed to kidnapping the second officer, Mr. Brandt. Not everyone on the ship was disturbed. The Shuntian ship's accountant slept soundly during the robbery. On Sunday, he got up and walked to the deck, thinking that the ship had arrived in Yantai. To his surprise, he was arrested by the pirates and locked in the smoking room. When the pirates occupied the Shuntian ship, two engineers were forced by the bandits at gunpoint to manage the engines as usual until 9 AM on Monday, when the pirates replaced them with two other engineers. There were eight pistols and four other types of guns on the ship, all of which were looted. (Reuters Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The British Embassy has made serious inquiries to the Central Government and Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu regarding the Shuntian steamer robbery. At the same time, they have dispatched Naval Attaché Duri to Jinan tonight to discuss with Han Fuqu the methods to rescue the kidnapped people. (Reuters Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) All newspapers have prominently featured the news of the Shuntian steamer robbery. The general opinion is that this case will not seriously affect Sino-British relations. London newspapers today praised the abilities of Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu and expressed confidence that Mr. Han will be able to make efforts to rescue the kidnapped people. The pirates claimed that they were originally smugglers and that recently, because the customs authorities have dispatched many patrol boats to various places along the Shandong coast to crack down on smuggling, they committed this robbery to retaliate. This statement has attracted much attention from merchants here. British merchants have repeatedly complained about the excessively high Chinese tax rates and will now try to persuade the government to inform the Chinese government about the adverse effects of excessively high tax rates on all countries, both Chinese and foreign.

<p>(Nanchang) Xiao Ke, the bandit leader on the west bank of the Gan River, used Jinhua Mountain as his lair. Yesterday, it was bombed by the Lotus Garrison. Six bombs were dropped on the bandit fortifications and trenches in the first attack. The bandits fled into the mountains to the northeast. Another bomb was dropped on the bandits, and it exploded in the middle of them. Four bombs were dropped in the second attack, one hitting a sentry post and three hitting trenches. In the third attack, seeing no bandits in the fortifications, only scattered bandits hiding in the woods, two bombs were dropped, both exploding in the middle of them. The two bandit leaders, Xiao Ke and Cai Huiwen, held a pseudo-military conference in Piaofang. Xiao advocated defending the old Jiangxi lair, while Cai advocated seeking other activities. They argued and pointed guns at each other. The pseudo-political director, Yu Zhaolin, mediated and warned each other. (Special Telegram, 19th)</p>

Bandit soldiers eat only two meals of thin porridge a day. (2) Regardless of gender, those aged 16 to 20 in the bandit area are organized into Young Pioneers, and those under 50 are organized into Red Guards. This kind of oppression forces them to be drafted into Red Guard militias, which are then concentrated and reorganized into the Red Army. The bandits are now implementing compulsory military service, forcibly conscripting them. After the recovery of the Zixi area, the old lair of the Fang bandits on the south bank of Qianshan, a certain unit more than ten miles above the bandit-occupied area is advancing to the Fujian border, which will be fully recovered. The HeKou disaster relief center has been advanced to Hengfeng.

<h3 id="e89">Chiang Orders Provinces to Reduce Additional Land Tax 丨Five Provinces Including Hubei and Hebei Have Already Replied丨 <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: In order to reduce the burden on farmers, Chairman Chiang, based on the resolutions of the Ten-Province Grain Conference, telegraphed all provinces from the Field Headquarters, instructing them to thoroughly investigate and list additional land taxes for examination, and to report the reduction of additional tax rates. The provinces and cities that have already replied include Hubei, Hebei, Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, reporting the amount of additional land tax and the reduction situation in their respective provinces and cities. Chiang individually instructed and informed them. The remaining provinces are still complying. The brief situation of the reports from each province and Chiang's instructions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hubei: The Director of the Hubei Finance Department replied that Hubei is a bandit suppression area, and the necessary security team's salaries and provisions are still designated to be funded by the mu tax as the basic expenditure. The mu tax is temporary in nature and will be abolished after the banditry is pacified. The Field Headquarters instructed that this was not allowed, stating roughly: Upon review, the land tax should collect more than 1.608 million yuan in additional taxes from various provincial tax items, which is the part attached to the regular tax. In addition, the provincial Ding Cao additional tax, together with the county local additional tax levied from the county tax items, and the mu tax amount to more than 5.141 million yuan, which belongs to the additional tax part. The ratio of additional tax to regular tax is almost equal to twice the regular tax, which is not in line with the established case that the additional tax should not exceed the regular tax. As for the mu tax, if it is mostly collected along with the grain, it is also one of the additional taxes and cannot be considered different from the additional tax simply because it is collected temporarily. Moreover, the province has a vast area and fertile land, but the amount of land tax collected is only more than 2.608 million yuan, which inevitably has the drawback of little grain and much land. You should immediately supervise the relevant authorities to thoroughly organize and report for verification in order to gradually align with the principle of balanced taxation, which is of utmost importance, and so on.</p>
<p>Hebei: Hebei only submitted a list of counties with additional land taxes that have been collected and those that have not. Chiang instructed: Upon review, the additional land tax in 41 counties such as Cangxian and Nanpi exceeds the regular tax by more than one time, and the additional tax in counties such as Jiahe, Jingxian, Wuqiao, Dongguang, and Wen'an exceeds the regular tax by more than three times, which is too harsh and complicated. You should immediately supervise the relevant authorities to follow the regulations promulgated by the Ministry for the reorganization of additional land taxes, and promptly reorganize and verify the reductions. In addition, the land where additional taxes are not levied in the province should also be listed separately as a basis for assessing the total amount of land tax in the province, and should be investigated and supplemented after the reorganization and reduction of additional donations.</p>
<p>Anhui: Anhui's reply telegram also stated that the additional taxes in various counties have increased due to the urgent need for funds for the bandit suppression teams, and measures are being drafted to reduce them. The Field Headquarters instructed five points: (1) Upon review, the additional land tax in counties such as Lujiang and Lu'an exceeds more than twice the regular tax, and there are many other counties that exceed one to two times. You should immediately follow the regulations promulgated by the Ministry for the reorganization of additional land taxes and thoroughly reduce them. (2, 3, 4 omitted) (5) The province has jurisdiction over 61 counties. What is the total amount of land tax in each county? The table did not include it. A detailed table should be reported after the additional reduction.</p>
<p>Henan: The Henan Finance Department replied: (1) The actual Ding Fu additional tax in each county does not exceed the regular tax. (2) In counties with less Ding silver, the mu tax inevitably exceeds the regular tax. (3) Recently, due to the expansion of security teams for bandit suppression, the additional taxes in each county in the province almost all exceed the regular tax. If the reduction is carried out in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry, it will be difficult for each county. The Field Headquarters instructed that the reduction of additional land tax is a general case. You should immediately supervise the relevant departments to draft a specific reduction plan based on the actual situation of each county and submit it for further review. Jiangxi: Due to the previous county autonomy and the urgent need for bandit suppression, the additional land tax in Jiangxi province has accumulated to the present day. Those with high taxes exceed the regular tax by four or five times, and those with low taxes are one or two times. They have now followed the regulations and uniformly reduced them to less than 70%, with an annual reduction of approximately two to three hundred thousand yuan, which has been reported to the Field Headquarters for record.</p>
<p>Shanghai: The Shanghai Special Municipal Government replied that since the division of the city and county in the 17th year, they have collected taxes in accordance with the old tax rules without any additional fees. However, in the Jiading Mountain area, some additional donations slightly exceeded the regular tax by about one li of silver, but the number is very small, and the rest are lower than the regular tax.

<h3 id="e90">Remnants of the Communists Differ on Escape and Defense, Food, Salt, Ammunition, and Medicine in the Communist Areas Are Exhausted, Main Force and Elite Are Almost Completely Lost <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The military affairs of bandit suppression on the border of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces have taken on a new form since Chiang Po-cheng arrived in Guangdong. Li Yang, commander of the Second Column, has remained in the province to await the outcome of military strategy discussions. The Eighth Division, led by Huang Zhiwen, captured 27 people, including Chen Kezhong, chairman of the Jiangnan County Soviet and important members of the Communist Party, in the battle of Junmen. After being interrogated and verified by the Third Army Department in Meixian, He Guanfang Lian was specially dispatched to escort Chen Kezhong and others to Shantou, where they were transferred to the Fu'an warship and escorted to the province. According to the confessions of the Communist bandit leaders, the Communist bandits in Jiangxi are surrounded by the National Army and have fallen into a state of siege. Those who are employed only receive one meal and one bowl of porridge a day. Salaries have been suspended since May of last year, and it has been a year now. The official allowance fee is 4 yuan per month for junior officers, 6 yuan for field officers, and 10 yuan for generals. The soldiers under their command have repeatedly mutinied, looting everywhere, and the officers cannot stop them. In fact, there is nothing to rob in the Communist areas. The young and strong people are scattered, and the old and weak die in the ditches. Due to the lack of salt, many suffer from beriberi. Recently, soldiers and civilians on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi have defected with their weapons, it is said.</p>
<p>Also, according to military reports from the front, the Communist bandit Luo Binghui's troops are currently stationed in Changting, Zhu De's troops are stationed in Gutian Shicheng, Ye Jianying's troops are stationed in Huichang, and Dong Zhentang and Xiao Ke's troops are stationed in Yudu Xingguo. The pseudo-17th Army Corps is in Liangxi Caoxieling (near Changting) on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, and the pseudo-9th Army Corps is south of Guangchang. Bandit Ye once dispatched Communist bandits from Ruijin Huichang to station at Shuikou, Jiangtou, Baibu, Pingyan, and other places to strictly guard against the Huai attack by the Southern Route Army. According to what is heard here, the Communist bandits have differing opinions on escape and defense. Those who advocate escape want to flee to Sichuan and Guizhou to join Bandit Xu, while those who advocate defense believe that if they abandon their nests and flee elsewhere, they will inevitably be intercepted and annihilated along the way. The Communist leaders have different wills, and the hearts of the people are shaken. The sign of a total collapse is fully revealed.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that after the Communist bandits were severely suppressed by the National Army five times, their elite troops were almost completely lost. Currently, each division is less than one regiment, and each regiment is smaller than a battalion of the National Army. The pseudo-22nd Division, which was stationed in Junmen and was known for its ferocity, was defeated in Junmen, and the division commander was sent to Huichang for punishment. Last month, the remnants of the division invaded Luotian and were defeated again by the bandit suppression group. They retreated to Huichang. On the 2nd of this month, they attacked Chongshi Tianxin in Anyuan and were defeated again by Li Zhen's regiment. Only five or six hundred people escaped. Now the division has been completely annihilated, and the name of the division no longer exists. In Huichang City, there are only thousands of student soldiers, model divisions, worker-peasant soldiers, and red guards newly transferred from Ruijin. Because of the disappearance of its strength, the Communist bandits forced the people in the Communist areas to become soldiers. Gu Longchang, the pseudo-Soviet chairman of Xunwu Anyuan County, opposed the conscription of those over 40 years old. When the Eighth Division conquered Qingxi, Gu was unwilling to lead the masses to flee with the Communist army, which led to his killing by the Communist bandits. Many people in Qingxi and Luotian were killed by the Communist bandits. Now the people in these two places are fleeing one after another. The National Army has established a temporary post-disaster relief association to accommodate them and organized a 500-member bandit suppression group under the command of Ouyang Xin, the magistrate of Huichang County, in order to assist the National Army in eliminating the bandits.</p>

<p>Zhou Correspondence: After the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was ordered to be renamed the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Railway Engineering Bureau immediately formed surveying teams and drilling teams to set off one after another. Except for the Yushan-Nanchang section, which has been surveyed, the Shangrao-Guixi section is still being rushed to survey the route on the north bank of the Xinhe River. The other lines have been basically determined, and the entire section has been divided. The entire section from Yushan to Nanchang is divided into four sections, and each section is divided into four segments. The first section starts from Yushan Station to Shaxi in Shangrao County. The second section is from Shaxi to Shangrao County. The third and fourth sections and the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth sections of the second section are still being surveyed. After the line is determined, it will be divided again. The third section starts from Taiqiao Chenjia in Guixi County to Zongmaogang in Guixi County as the ninth section. From Zongmaogang to Yangxi Chenjia in Dongxiang County as the tenth section. From Yangxi Chenjia to Siqian in Dongxiang County as the eleventh section. From Siqian to Xiabuji in Jinxian County as the thirteenth section. The fourth section is from Xiabuji to Gaoqiao in Jinxian County as the thirteenth section. From Gaoqiao to Liangjiadu in Nanchang County as the fourteenth section. From Liangjiadu to Liantang in Nanchang County as the fifteenth section. From Liantang to Nanchang as the sixteenth section. Each section of 10,000 cubic meters of engineering work is being put out for tender and construction, and the bidding will be opened on the 25th of this month, and contracts will be awarded separately, and construction will begin simultaneously. Regarding the improvement along the line, after Deputy Director of the Bureau Hou Jiayuan inspected, he believed that the various business equipment of the Jinyu branch were not perfect, and he planned to supplement them immediately. He also sent Deputy Engineer Chen Zujun to inspect the bridge engineering of the Pinghan and Longhai Railways to learn from them. All freight warehouses, rain sheds, station platforms, and other projects in each station will be built quickly. In addition, the tasks such as transferring road police for training and studying and promoting business methods are being carried out separately. (June 17)</p>

<p>Chen Yu, the chairman of the Garment Industry Guild, was arrested during the strike of garment industry workers on suspicion of being a member of the Axe Gang and has been detained in the Public Security Bureau for more than ten days and has not been released. Chen accused Shen Wei, the director of the Public Security Bureau, of illegal arrest and filed a complaint with the local court against Shen for abuse of power and obstruction of freedom. After investigation by the prosecutor, it was deemed that Shen, as the director of the Public Security Bureau, arrested Chen to maintain local security during the strike, which was not improper, and the case was dismissed. On the one hand, the county government reported the situation to the Department of Civil Affairs for verification. Yesterday, it was instructed to escort Chen to Zhenjiang for investigation.</p>

All county tax revenues, except for the land survey fees that are directly submitted to the provincial treasury, and other items, regardless of whether they are regular taxes, miscellaneous fees, or treasury agency, immediately convened relevant parties for thorough discussion, but specific measures have not yet been determined. Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Changshu, Liyang, Jintan, Yixing, and other counties believe that the designation of the provincial treasury for unified revenue and expenditure, and the issue of the custody of county property in the future, all need thorough discussion. A meeting has been scheduled to be held in Suzhou on (blank day) to jointly discuss appropriate measures.</p>

<p>The Guangming Hospital on Tonghui Road in Xiyi was initially organized by doctors Jin Deming and others, and was taken over by Western medicine doctor Guo Songyi a week ago. Unexpectedly, at four o'clock the night before, a fire suddenly broke out on the floor of the hospital. At that time, the wind was raging and the fire was extremely fierce, turning into a prairie fire. It spread to the Xiangtai Grain Store on the right, as well as the Baohe Tang Chinese Medicine Store, Ding Yongtai Machine Wood Sample Shop, Yuantong Grocery Store, Tongyi Refined Salt Company, Chengcang Iron Factory, Dai Deyuan Iron Factory, Xinshunxing Iron Factory, Yidefeng Foreign Goods Store, Tianchang Tofu Store, and more than ten other stores. The fire lasted for two and a half hours, causing losses of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Only Tongyi Refined Salt Company had fire insurance of 10,000 yuan, and Baohe Tang Chinese Medicine Store had insurance of 2,000 yuan. The rest were not insured against fire. Afterwards, the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau ordered Guo Songyi, who started the fire, and Xu Yinggong, the owner of Baohe Tang Medicine Store, to come to the bureau to inquire about the cause of the fire, and they were immediately released on bail. In addition, three firefighters, Sun Genquan, Zhang Liangfu, and Shen Quan, were injured during the firefighting and have been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Changshu, Road Workers on the Suzhou-Changshu Highway Petition <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The County Government here received an order from the Department of Transportation that in order to prepare for the opening of the Transportation Fair, the Suzhou-Changshu Highway must be built and completed by the end of July. The county has now invited bids and signed a contract with Wang Ankang's workshop to build the road. Unexpectedly, when personnel from the Engineering Office of the County Construction Section set out to set stakes to prepare for construction the other day, they suddenly discovered that the flat plan approved by the Provincial Construction Department was different from the county's soil excavation survey. Therefore, they reported to the province for instructions on the one hand, and stopped construction on the other hand. However, after the road work was stopped, more than 1,000 workers who contracted to build the road had already come to Changshu. The sudden interruption of work and the loss to the road workers were huge. Wang Ankang's workshop specifically went to the county to petition, and declared the issue of responsibility, saying that the suspension of work for three days has already resulted in a loss of more than 3,000 yuan, which should be compensated by the county government, and so on.</p>
<p>Because of this, Pang Shoubai, the head of the Construction Section, went to the province in person because the matter was of great importance. He returned to Changshu on the 18th. According to reports, the contract signed between the county government and the workshop stipulated that construction would start on the 10th, and the road workers had already come to Changshu long ago. The county cannot be responsible for all the losses. The funds will be used to build the road mu tax, which should not be a problem. However, in order to alleviate the losses of the workers, in addition to telegraphing the Construction Department for instructions again, the construction of the ten meters on both sides of the bridge piers in each section will be started first to make up for it. As for the Changtai Road project, there are no obstacles and the progress is quite smooth. Construction has now started and it is expected that the entire road can be opened to traffic before the 20th of next month.</p>

<p>The farmland near the Dong'an Town in Wuyi Southern Township is mostly along the West Ge Lake. During the summer last year, a large number of flying locusts were discovered, and efforts were made to capture them day and night to avoid disaster. Unexpectedly, recently, locust nymphs have been found everywhere along the lake. Gu Zhizhuan, director of the Rural Improvement Experimental Zone there, went to conduct an on-site investigation and found that the larger locust nymphs had already grown wings and could fly, and the smaller ones were shaped like black ants and covered the fields. Director Gu immediately reported the situation to the county government for verification on the 18th. County Magistrate Cai immediately ordered the farm administrator He Zhaoxi to go to the countryside to guide the extermination and immediately...</p>

<p>Bandit cases have occurred frequently in Xiannv Town and Yiling in Yishui County. After the reconnaissance team arrested the bandit Gu Xiqing, he confessed to many accomplices. Gu was then taken as a spy and captured Gu Xie, Guan Guozaozi, Fang Guangcai, Xu Haichun, Zhu Wentao, Pan Xiaomazi, Yang Youyu, Qi Xiaosanzi, and other eight people in Xianzhen.

<p>Chen Shizhong, a resident of Yantan Town Xiye Chenzhuang in Jiangdu Fifth District, lived with Zhang Shiyi and Shirentong. He had more than 80 mu of land and was the wealthiest man in the area. He had long been coveted by bandits. Sun also took precautions in advance. In addition to digging two cellars in his house to store valuables and foreign currency, and receiving self-defense firearms and artillery, the entire courtyard of the house was covered with barbed wire, with only a narrow alley less than a foot wide uncovered. Unexpectedly, at dawn on the 17th, a few bandits with accents suddenly entered through the alley not covered with barbed wire, grabbed the entire family of Shizhong and bound them with nets, forcing them to hand over self-defense firearms, searching all the rooms for clothing and the foreign currency stored in the two cellars. They also used fire to burn and scorch the three brothers of Shizhong, forcing them to tell where the valuables were hidden until they were severely injured and on the verge of death. It is now reported that Shiyi was too seriously injured and died on the afternoon of the 17th. The local town Ding has reported to the town office and forwarded the report to the district for investigation. The total loss is said to be more than 3,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Although the gang of sea bandits led by Pan Kaiqu was dispersed by the military and police in previous years, a part of them still appeared in the East China Sea and the East Ocean, robbing merchants and fishing boats. On the morning of the 11th, more than 100 bandits from the gang, driving five or six boats, landed in Xuntan, entered the village and kidnapped five people, including the resident Chen Dalang. Then they went to Sanzhuang Town and kidnapped seven fishermen, detained them on the bandit boat, and demanded a ransom of 300 to 400 or 500 to 600 yuan per person, with a strict deadline and threats to tear up the tickets if the deadline was missed. When the police and army heard the news and went to suppress them, the bandits had already set sail and fled. The local residents are now panicked. It is unknown how those responsible for maintaining security will find a way to resolve this situation.</p>

<p>Ye Xian'gen, the owner of the Chunji Timber Firm in Lingjiang Port, has been in business for many years and has made a lot of profits. Last month, when he purchased a large batch of timber, the timber was scattered due to strong winds and high tides. The porters, Zhang Lang and others, rearranged them and transported them to the firm. By the evening, the porter Zhang Lang ran to the home of Huang Zhisan, who lived by the Jiangbin, claiming that his son, Xiaoyou, had once cut grass on the beach and stolen seven or eight large pieces of wood. They claimed to have been ordered by the owner to investigate and that you must go abroad to deal with it. Zhisan retorted that his son, Xiaoyou, was young and could not steal wood. Ten days later, the Chunji firm detained Huang's wife in the town, threatening her in every possible way. Xue Lao'er Xu Shouyi and others fined him 12 yuan. He paid 12 yuan immediately to escape temporarily. Afterwards, Zhisan, feeling unwilling, hired lawyer Huang to sue Xue and Xu for extorting money on the pretext of a problem. Xu and others, seeing that the case had expanded, detained Huang's wife at the Fourth District Office on the Dragon Boat Festival. On the other hand, they called the shop to carry three or four large pieces of wood into Huang's house in an attempt to cover up the truth.</p>

<p>Shi Ningtian, a notorious bandit in Lian and Fu counties, led his gang for several years, occupying Lian and Fu counties, burning, killing, and looting everything. The county government repeatedly issued orders to arrest him, but failed to do so. He also stubbornly resisted the police team from time to time. Unexpectedly, the bandit recently sneaked into Shenjiazhuang in Beixiang in our county, which was discovered by the police team. Huang Gongzheng, the captain of the Third Squadron of the Police Brigade stationed in Qitao, led the team to join forces with Wu Jianhong, a member of the guard regiment, and led the militiamen to encircle and suppress him. The bandit leader Shi Ningtian and Tian's uncle Sun Er were both killed on the spot, and Tian's brother Shi Baochang was captured. The rest all fled. The team has now sent the two bandit corpses and the captured bandit Shi Baochang to the city for verification by the county government.</p>

<p>Education Bureau Chief Huang Qingrui's relationship with the elementary schools in various districts has fractured due to the accumulation of unpaid education funds. After the County Education Association, along with the Education Associations of various districts, jointly issued a declaration stating their non-cooperation, Huang, misled by rumors, even submitted a written complaint to the County Magistrate. The complaint essentially stated that Mao Youlun, a teacher from one of the districts, was inciting all elementary schools to strike and requested action. Upon hearing this news, the elementary schools were furious, and a strike seemed imminent. The atmosphere suddenly became tense. County Magistrate Zhang urgently summoned representatives from each school to earnestly appease them and pledged to allocate funds to cover one month's worth of arrears, thus averting the action.</p>

<p>Inside the Public Sports Field, a podium was erected with a banner reading "Shanghai Thirteenth Annual Hygiene Campaign" above it. In the center of the stage, portraits of the Party, the nation, and Sun Yat-sen were hung. The recording seats were arranged on both sides, and the Public Security Bureau military band was present to participate.

<h3 id="e108">Opening Ceremony Speech by Mayor Wu (Xu Tianzhang) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>I deeply recognize the importance of personal health, so we cannot ignore personal and public hygiene. This city holds a hygiene campaign every year. This time, it coincides with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's promotion of the New Life Movement, so this year's hygiene campaign has been further expanded. There are twenty or thirty participating groups and organizations, and I am very grateful for the enthusiastic assistance of the participating groups and organizations, which has made everything proceed smoothly. There are five things to pay attention to in this year's hygiene campaign: (1) Develop good habits for spitting; (2) Urinate in the toilet; (3) Throw garbage into the garbage can; (4) Drink boiled water; and (5) Get vaccinated. These five things are the most important. If all our citizens can do the above five things, then public hygiene will have better results.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Mayor's Speech <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Next, Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave a speech, briefly stating that today is the opening of the city's thirteenth cleaning campaign. Cleaning is the basic work of public hygiene and can also be said to be an important condition for promoting public hygiene construction. There are many people in cities, and whether the urban population is healthy or not is closely related to the success or failure of the entire urban undertaking. We live in cities and engage in various undertakings, and we all hope for the success of our undertakings, but the success of an undertaking depends on whether the overall health environment is suitable as a prerequisite. The so-called suitability of the health environment depends on the extent of the efforts made in public hygiene. Therefore, the quality of public hygiene can predict the success or failure of an undertaking. However, the effectiveness of public hygiene must depend on the efforts of all citizens. Regardless of farmers, workers, merchants, young, old, rich, or poor, everyone should pay close attention to public hygiene. The construction of public hygiene requires the efforts of the masses. Today, there are often people who are selfish and cannot take care of public hygiene. The so-called selfishness is that residents only seek the hygiene of themselves or their families and do not care about others. This kind of harmful behavior is everywhere. For example, some residents often pour sewage and garbage on the streets. They only seek the cleanliness of their own homes, but they do not know that this sewage and garbage is the source of infectious diseases. This kind of behavior is really harmful. I am not a superstitious person, but in fact, due to the prevalence of infectious diseases, one's self is also unavoidable. Therefore, we must publicize this idea to all citizens so that everyone has the common sense of personal hygiene and extends it to the common sense of public hygiene. In other words, everyone can know how to maintain personal hygiene and at the same time pay attention to public hygiene. We deeply know that the cleaning campaign is the basic work for promoting public hygiene, and public hygiene is the prerequisite for the progress of all construction undertakings in the city. If the urban cleaning campaign can be resolved, then public hygiene can also be resolved, creating a very good healthy environment in the city, and everyone can work hard on various construction undertakings. Therefore, the cleaning campaign is very important. I hope that everyone can earnestly persuade the general public to comply. Finally, I will also gather leaders from all walks of life to unite all citizens to create a regular, orderly urban public hygiene. I hope that people will work hard to promote this matter.</p>

<p>Next, Tong Xingbai, the representative of the Municipal Party Committee, gave a speech, briefly stating that there is actually no distinction between personal and public hygiene in the implementation of hygiene because individuals are a part of the public, and individuals cannot live apart from the public. The relationship between people in society is extremely close. One person is enough to affect the entire society. There is no reason for any individual to be independent in society. If an individual has unsanitary facts, it is enough to hinder the public. Therefore, everyone must be hygienic, and everyone must be healthy, and then the whole society will be blessed. Everyone must not think that the hygiene campaign is a small matter. Its relationship with the country and the nation is not shallow. The low status of our nation and the unhealthy and unsanitary people are the main reasons. In today's world of survival and competition, without healthy citizens, there is no way to talk about excellent culture. Therefore, the hygiene campaign is a national salvation movement. If we think that the hygiene campaign is just to solve the problems of small mosquitoes, garbage, and spitting, then we are only seeing the small and not the big.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Mr. Wang's Speech <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce gave a speech. Mr. Wang said that the greatest happiness in life is health, and the most important element of health is hygiene. Hygiene must also be accompanied by exercise. Those who are unwilling to exercise must be lazy, and those who are lazy must be unsanitary. This is a connected relationship. I also believe that the hygiene campaign is a major undertaking. Simply cleaning the surface is not enough. We must first clean the hearts of people. Once the heart is filthy, it is useless to clean the surface. Therefore, from today onwards, everyone should first clean the filth of the heart, and second, clean the filth of the body. When everyone's body and mind are cleaned, the public hygiene problem and the health problem will be solved.</p>

<p>At 2:00 PM, the Municipal Health Bureau issued a hygiene lockdown order. The Municipal Health Bureau posted notices at various public announcement locations, urging citizens throughout the city to abide by the five basic hygiene requirements stipulated in the lockdown order. The New Life Movement persuasion teams, based on the provisions of the lockdown order, verbally persuaded citizens from all walks of life to strictly comply. The Chinese and foreign police agencies also assisted the persuasion teams in enforcing the order. After the hygiene lockdown order was issued, the five items stipulated in the order would be permanently enforced, ensuring that citizens throughout the city would develop these good habits. In order to arouse public attention to the hygiene campaign, the Municipal Health Bureau specially invited Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Tong Xingbai, a standing committee member of the Municipal Party Committee, to broadcast speeches on radio stations at Chinese and Western pharmacies and the Buddhist Sound Broadcasting Station at 4:00 PM (the speeches are published in a special issue).</p>

The civil residences sponsored by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau will also have vaccination teams dispatched by the Municipal Health Bureau to force vaccinations. Therefore, the number of people vaccinated has already reached tens of thousands in one day. As for the various rural areas, the Municipal Health Bureau has also ordered various health offices to dispatch vaccination teams to the villages to administer vaccinations.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Sino-British Bank Annual Meeting Reports Favorable Conditions on Both Railways; Excerpts from the Management Bureau's Report <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Management Bureau of the Jinpu Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway issued a statement that the 36th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the Sino-British Bank was held at the company's office at 3 Lombard Street in London. Mr. Pinatt presided over the meeting, and Mr. Pinatt reported in detail on the recent conditions of China's state-owned railways. Excerpts related to both railways are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e122">Jinpu Railway <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The damage suffered by the railway in 1932 has been repaired, and work has returned to normal. The financial situation is also stable. The total income for this year (referring to 1922) is 13.5 million yuan, an increase of approximately 4 million yuan compared to the previous year. Due to the establishment of the ferry between Xiaguan and Pukou and the addition of vehicles to develop combined transport operations, the railway had to allocate a portion of its income to capital expenditure, which has limited its debt repayment capacity to some extent. The proposal to relocate the Shanghai Main Station is still pending. The railway's main office was bombed by aircraft in 1932. The original site has now been rebuilt and allocated to the Transportation Department for office use. The funds borrowed from the company in 1929 to purchase vehicles are now being used to develop business and cope with competition. The funds allocated by the railway to the company for debt repayment have been received on time each month. Since the completion of the Yangtze River railway ferry linking the Tianjin-Pukou line, the progress in income has been extremely significant, and the future prospects are bright. As for expenditures, there is still room for economy in the future. The Chinese and British staff of the railway get along very well, and there is no animosity between them. Their hard work is admirable and deserves to be commended. The railway's finances have gradually improved through gradual reforms. Even the originally overdue interest coupons from 1932 were paid off at the end of last year. The dividends due to the holder of the 1929 net profit coupons were paid in October. Although there are still some outstanding payments, unless there is an unforeseen event that the Chinese government has never been willing to succumb to, there will be no obstacles to the future development of the railway, and the date of its recovery can be counted on fingers.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>During the year, the total income of the railway has exceeded 6 million yuan, almost equivalent to the previous year's figures. The ability to repay debt is improving day by day. Since June 1922, the amount of special reserve funds on the account has been increased from 10% to 20% of the total income. In addition, a certain amount has been withdrawn from the surplus income of the Jinpu Railway as a reserve for debt repayment. The amount due for withdrawal in June last year, which has not been paid, will now be prepared on schedule so that the Sino-British bonds will be fully repaid by the end of the year. The Chinese government is now working hard to complete the unfinished sections of the line and to build the Qiantang River Bridge in Hangzhou. If both of these come to fruition, then the sharp increase in the railway's income in the future is a matter of course.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Pirates Hijack New Shuntian Steamer; Shanghai News: One Crew Member Shot; Sixteen People Abducted; Valuables Looted; Cargo Holds and Machinery Untouched <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The New Shuntian, a steamship of the Southern Taikoo Line that had been built at the Hong Kong shipyard and sent to Shanghai to replace the old Shunda steamer on the North China route, set sail on its maiden voyage from Shanghai on June 2. Then, on the 17th, on its second voyage from Shanghai to Tianjin, when it was sailing from Tanggu to Zhifu at about 10:30 p.m., it was hijacked by pirates. The terrifying case involved the shooting of a crew member and the abduction of a large number of Chinese and foreign passengers and crew members, totaling twenty-six. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Pirates Planned for a Long Time <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>When the British firm Ewo Yanghsing's Yisheng steamer was robbed, the bandits told the people on board that they had originally intended to rob a Taikoo's northbound steamer, but because there were too many people on board and the defenses were stricter, they did not dare to do so, so they changed to rob the Yisheng steamer. This matter was reported in the newspaper. After the six people on board the Yisheng steamer were kidnapped, months have passed, and they have not yet been rescued. Now, the Taikoo's New Shuntian steamer has been hijacked again. The pirates have been planning the robbery for a long time, not just for a day or two.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Bandits Disembarked from Tianjin <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The New Shuntian steamer has a very good passenger seat layout, so it has more passengers than other steamers. This time, when it sailed south from Tianjin, the ship carried more than 300 first-, second-, and third-class passengers. About 30 pirates disguised themselves as passengers in Tianjin and boarded the ship. After boarding the ship, they scattered in the various cabin levels. When the steamer sailed from Tanggu at 10:30 p.m., when the passengers were sound asleep, the ship had already sailed near the mouth of the Yellow River. The pirates who had mixed in the ship then sneaked up to the deck from the various cabins. They were very familiar with the ship's route, and it seemed that they had already seen it clearly in advance. As soon as the pirates appeared, several pirates occupied the ship's radio room. The pirates drew their guns and forced the radio operator to go to the smoking room and detain him there. Then, they divided up and began to rob.</p>
<h3 id="e129">All Crew Members Imprisoned <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>When the radio operator was detained, the ship's captain, Mr. Christie, suddenly heard urgent footsteps and noisy voices on the ship. He rushed out of the captain's room to investigate. However, as soon as Mr. Christie reached the door, he was captured by three pirates who had been lying in wait outside. They used guns to stop his movements and escorted him to the smoking room and detained him there. At that time, the third officer, Mr. Ross, who was on duty, was driving the ship. The pirates forced him to leave the ship. Ross refused and resisted the pirates. He was shot and wounded by the pirates. Two other crew members and two engine crew members were also forced to be detained in the smoking room, guarded by several pirates.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Pirates Control the Ship <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>After the crew members were detained, the entire ship was under the control of the pirates. When the ship was sailing, the management of the engine was handed over to a pirate to drive. The pirate had considerable maritime experience. The direction of the ship had gradually changed and was heading towards the mouth of the Yellow River. The pirates then went in batches to the passengers in each cabin and began to rob them. The looted items were temporarily placed in the smoking room. The New Shuntian steamer ran aground at the mouth of the Yellow River from 4:00 a.m. on the 18th until it floated out after the robbery, lasting a total of twelve hours.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Passengers Looted <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>During the search, almost all passengers in the cabins of all levels were spared. All cash, jewelry, clothing, and other items were looted. The bandits searched the ship several times, lasting twelve hours. Even the passengers' luggage, baskets, and bags were opened and searched. Among the passengers, there were ten foreign men and women. The British Consul in Qingdao, Mr. Lyle, and his wife were also on board. The bandits selected clothes that fit their bodies from the looted clothes and changed into them in the ship, and threw the original worn clothes into the cabins.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Abduction of Passengers Before Departure <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. on the 18th, the bandits packed the looted silver and jewelry and first arranged for five civilian boats to stop on the ship's side. When the pirates were about to leave, they abducted twenty-one passengers from the first- and second-class cabins, and wanted to kidnap four foreign passengers and two crew members. As a result, they abducted five people, including the Westerners Nico Pfeiffer, Ross, Third Officer Wasson, Second Officer Breit, and the Japanese Yamamoto. The twenty-six Chinese and foreign people were then escorted onto the civilian boats and fled.</p>

<p>After the bandits left, the captain, Mr. Christie, and the Chinese comprador, Sun Rangsan, sent a radio message to Shanghai, briefly stating that the New Shuntian steamer had been robbed, the Chinese crew members were safe, and asked to inform their families. Third Officer Ross was shot and injured and was in critical condition. Second Officer Si and three Western passengers and twenty-one Chinese passengers were kidnapped. After the crew members on board escaped, they first repaired the radio. The captain also sent a distress call. The stranded ship floated up at high tide and corrected its course to head towards Yantai. All the weapons on board had been looted by the bandits, but the cargo holds had not been opened and the machinery had not been damaged, so it could still sail.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Warships Rushed to Escort <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The British destroyer HMS Witch, stationed in Weihaiwei, and the American destroyer stationed in Yantai rushed to the mouth of the Yellow River after receiving a telegram from the New Shuntian. The New Shuntian happened to meet them on the way and was escorted to Zhifu. On the morning of the 19th,</p>
<p>the ship finally arrived in Yantai under the protection of a British warship. After the ship stopped, the seriously injured Third Officer Ross was first sent to the American Hospital for emergency treatment. After loading passengers in Yantai, the ship set sail for Qingdao at 9:00 a.m.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Ships Expected in Shanghai This Afternoon <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Xinshun Tian Steamer is currently en route, and the journey from Yantai to Qingdao takes approximately eighteen hours. After a brief stop in Qingdao, it will continue to Shanghai, with an additional twenty-five hours of travel time. Therefore, it is estimated that the Xinshun Tian Steamer will arrive at the port this afternoon. Upon arrival in Shanghai, the ship will dock at Pier No. 3 in the French Concession along the Xinkai River. Details regarding the hijacking and the extent of the losses will be available once the ship arrives in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Following the incident, warships from the British and American navies stationed in Yantai and Weihaiwei have been dispatched to patrol the ports of Tanggu, Yantai, and the Bohai Sea to pursue and apprehend the pirates. Han Fuqu, the Chairman of Shandong Province, also received a telegram from the Yantai local authorities and dispatched land and naval forces to cooperate with the British and American warships in searching the coastal areas.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Status of Post-Incident Measures <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Taikoo Dockyard Company was shocked by the news. Now they are waiting for the ship to arrive in Shanghai and have decided to add anti-theft iron netting to the ship and increase the escort team to ensure maritime safety. Since yesterday, they have ordered all departing ships to take strict precautions. Yesterday, the Suzhou steamer, which departed from Shanghai for Qingdao, stopped carrying passengers. Furthermore, when the Xin Shengjing steamer departed for Beiyang, the company specially dispatched three inspectors to board the ship and search the passengers. The Jianghai Customs also dispatched a small vessel to accompany the Shengjing, inspecting passengers in all classes of cabins along the way until it returned to Wusong. The British Navy even sent a warship to accompany the ship for protection. According to the Da Mei Evening News, news was received in Shanghai today (the 19th) that the British warship [name missing] is preparing to leave Weihaiwei immediately, carrying multiple aircraft. If the Chinese authorities permit British aircraft to operate within Chinese territory, the aircraft will be used to scout for the pirates who hijacked the Shuntian steamer in order to rescue those who were kidnapped.</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, more than 20 overseas Chinese from Wenzhou and other places in China were living in Yonezawa City, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, which is an ordinary city. They established a total of 13 restaurants, and for eight years, they had lived in relative harmony. However, since the September 18th Incident, the local authorities in that area had been making things difficult for the overseas Chinese in every way, and they had been subjected to insults and abuses, which they could only endure in silence. In June of this year, Yoshimura, the police chief of the Yonezawa City Police Station, suddenly dispatched numerous police officers, using the excuse that they needed to renew their business licenses, otherwise they would be banned. However, the overseas Chinese had been doing business for many years, and according to the usual practice, they had renewed their licenses in April of each year as required, and this year they had also been renewed, so why were there any additional complications? The police station refused to listen to explanations and immediately dispatched police to arrest and detain all the overseas Chinese. Wang Hongnian, the Chinese Consul in Yokohama, made representations to Sato, the Director of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but to no avail. They were detained for two nights. On the 10th of this month, more than ten maritime police officers were dispatched to escort all the overseas Chinese to Osaka, where they stayed overnight. On the 12th, the overseas Chinese were escorted to Yokohama, boarded the Japanese cargo ship Tsukuba Maru, and returned to their home country. All their property was confiscated. The overseas Chinese arrived in Shanghai at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, and the ship docked at the Huishan Pier in Hongkou, where their plight was quite wretched.</p>

<p>After arriving in Shanghai, the distressed overseas Chinese were unfamiliar with the local conditions and had nowhere to turn. Fortunately, a fellow Wenzhou native, Mr. Zhu, ran a hotel in Nanshi and offered to take care of them. A reporter from the Dagong News Agency went to investigate and found the names of the overseas Chinese to be: Hu Zhichao, Chen Xitie, Chen Chongshan, Wu Defa, Zheng Xipeng, Ye Shengyi, Zhu Yisheng, Dong Duanjun, Zhu Guimiao, Zhu Tongsheng, Wei Lianchang, Zhu Tonglian, Xu Tingfang, Wu Zhengxiang, and Hu Zhaoqing, 16 people in total.</p>

<p>The distressed overseas Chinese lacked travel expenses to return to their hometowns and felt it was difficult to stay in Shanghai. Furthermore, they planned to go to Beijing to report to the central government and request negotiations. Therefore, at 10 a.m. yesterday, they sent representatives Hu Zhichao, Chen Chongxi, and five others to the Fenglinqiao Municipal Party Headquarters to petition for relief. Zhang Zixiao, the Director of the General Affairs Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Yu Yaoqiu, a clerk from the Investigation Section, received them, inquired about the details of their expulsion, and the overseas Chinese presented various supporting documents. Mr. Zhang and others expressed that they would find a way to provide relief.</p>

<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters further investigated and found that all 16 of the distressed overseas Chinese were members of the Kuomintang. The main reason for their expulsion was their participation in patriotic movements in Japan, which aroused the Japanese authorities' jealousy. Therefore, they dispatched Yu Yaoqiu, a clerk from the Investigation Section, to contact the Red Cross Society, which issued them ship tickets. They are scheduled to take a boat to Beijing this afternoon to report the details of their expulsion to the Central Party Headquarters and request that the matter be referred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for serious negotiations in order to safeguard the safety of overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3 id="e143">A Letter to Compatriots <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>In order to make our compatriots aware of the recent treatment of overseas Chinese by Japan, the distressed overseas Chinese drafted a detailed report to the compatriots across the country, which reads as follows: To all newspaper offices, comrades, and compatriots across the country: We, the overseas Chinese residing in Japan, have been subjected to oppression by the Japanese people for a long time. Numerous people have returned to China one after another, but the people of our country have been indifferent to this, which is a great sigh. Our government has not made efforts to protect us, and our compatriots have not given us great assistance, so that countless weak overseas Chinese have been humiliated by the Japanese people and have been crying overseas. Recently, sixteen overseas Chinese residing in Yonezawa City, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, were arrested and imprisoned by the Japanese police authorities, their property was confiscated, and they were ordered to return to their home country. On the 10th of this month, they were humiliated and returned on the Tsukuba Maru from Yokohama and arrived in Shanghai on the 18th. We, the overseas Chinese, have been doing business in Yonezawa City for more than eight years, and we have all been diligent, thrifty, cautious, and self-reliant, so we have accumulated some savings to this day. However, since the September 18th Incident, the city police station has often unreasonably oppressed and humiliated us, which is truly unacceptable. We believe that our motherland is in a time of trouble, and the national crisis is serious. We are deeply moved by the fate of the people of the secondary colonial countries who endure humiliation and hardship. We are deeply aware of the responsibility of uniting overseas Chinese to save the country from danger. Otherwise, we will be slaughtered by others forever. Temporary humiliation can only be endured. Although there have been incidents in which the Japanese police stopped business operations from time to time, after negotiations, they were still able to operate as usual. Unexpectedly, on the 2nd of last month, the city police station repeated its old tricks and went even further, arresting and imprisoning all the overseas Chinese in Yonezawa City without any reason, and ordering us, the overseas Chinese, to forcibly pay 35 yen each before the 15th as travel expenses to return to our home country. When asked why they were escorting all the overseas Chinese in Yonezawa City back to their home country, they replied that restaurants should have licenses, and since [you] do not have licenses, you should be banned. We have investigated that all the overseas Chinese in Yonezawa City have the licenses, and they have been doing business there for more than eight years. Every April, they renew them according to the rules. However, this year, they have already submitted the licenses from last year and asked them to renew them, but the authorities not only did not issue them, but said that since there are no licenses, they should be banned. It is extremely lawless. Furthermore, after the overseas Chinese were arrested and imprisoned in the police station, all their property was confiscated. Old debts were not allowed to be recovered, and new savings were all in vain. Alas, the hard work of the overseas Chinese, the blood and sweat of several years, were all gone in one morning. There was no response to heaven, and there was no way to ask for help. Although we begged the Consul General in Yokohama to ask our country's ambassador to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government with all our strength, it was to no avail. Therefore, on the 10th of this month, we were ordered by the police to take the Japanese cargo ship Tsukuba Maru from Yokohama back to our home country and arrived in Shanghai on the 18th. Furthermore, five of the overseas Chinese had been living in Japan for a long time, married Japanese women, and had children. The five Japanese women, due to the love between husband and wife, returned to their home country with them, hoping to grow old together. However, when the ship arrived in Kobe, they were also detained by the maritime police and were not allowed to return with the overseas Chinese. Alas, young children have become fatherless, and young women have become wifeless. Anyone with a little heart would feel sad when they hear about it. Marriage freedom is permitted by Japanese law, but the Japanese police persecute us regardless of right and wrong. Their inhumanity is unimaginable. We deeply hope that compatriots across the country will rise up and rescue us. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. Otherwise, the remaining overseas Chinese in Japan will be trampled on by this poisonous tooth and iron hoof one after another. This is a joint statement from the overseas Chinese in Yonezawa City, Japan.</p>

At 4:30 p.m., it can fly back to Lanzhou, stay overnight, and then return to Shanghai along the original route the next day. Although the distance between Lanzhou and Ningxia is not far, transportation is inconvenient and travel is difficult. Therefore, after the opening of the route, transportation between the two places has been greatly facilitated. (Central News Agency)</p>

<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the Guangdong-Hong Kong Press Delegation, which traveled from Hong Kong via Shanghai to North China and other places for investigation, lasted for more than a month. It is now learned that the delegation of eight people, except for Chen Kewen who stayed in Beijing due to some matters and will come to Shanghai again within days, have all returned to Shanghai yesterday. After sending their luggage to the hotel, some members took the night train to Hangzhou last night to visit the West Lake. It is scheduled to stay in Hangzhou for two or three days before returning to Shanghai to gather and take a ship back to Guangdong and Hong Kong. This time, the delegation went north for more than a month, departing from Guangdong and Hong Kong, passing through Shanghai to Beijing, visiting the capital, then transferring to Jiangxi to meet Jiang [Chiang Kai-shek], and inspecting the recovered bandit areas. Then, from Jiangxi to Hubei, along the Pinghan Railway to Beiping to visit the North China war zone, such as Shanhaiguan. Finally, they returned south from Beiping to Tianjin.

<h3 id="e148">Wang Yansong Resigns from the Supervisory Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Wang Yansong, the newly elected member of the Supervisory Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was originally a Standing Committee member of the Chamber of Commerce for four years. At the end of the current term, he was not allowed to be re-elected in accordance with the regulations. However, Wang was extremely enthusiastic and responsible in handling the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce and safeguarding commerce during his tenure. During the turbulent times, he experienced many difficulties. During the January 28th Incident, Shanghai was the first to bear the brunt, and he experienced panic and shock. He was able to calmly deal with the situation and avoid difficulties, so he was deeply trusted by representatives of all industries. In this re-election, he was still elected as a member of the Supervisory Committee by a majority. However, Wang wanted to rest and recuperate after serving for a long time, so he wrote to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to request his resignation. The original letter is recorded as follows: "To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce: I, Yansong, have completed my current term, and I hope to have a temporary rest with the protection of laws and regulations. Unexpectedly, the election results still have me as a member of the Supervisory Committee. Public opinion is where it is, and it is difficult to let down [the public]. My private feelings are really regrettable. Thinking that I have worked hard in commercial transportation for many years, from being entrusted by the central government to unify the merchant organizations, to legally establishing the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, I have been elected as a Standing Committee member for six years. In the past, it was always difficult for the group meetings to meet the legal quorum, and those who were scattered and undisciplined criticized it. I, Yansong, uphold the principle, engage in unity, work hard, and do not avoid resentment. Fortunately, following the members, I can avoid mistakes. In terms of merchant organizations, they are now slightly better than in the past. In addition, I have strived to seek welfare and reduce pain as much as possible. On the Jing [Beijing] Road, I have been busy with official documents and appeals. My humble heart is only to ensure that the business community does its best and contributes its meager efforts to fulfill its responsibilities to the utmost. In recent years, I have felt tired and tired. I hope to take a small break when I resign. Fortunately, the newly elected gentlemen are all outstanding talents, and the re-elected members are familiar with the work. The Chamber of Commerce will prosper and develop in the future. I, Yansong, as a leisurely person, am fortunate to see the vigorous image. All the duties of the Supervisory Committee are hereby solemnly declared, and I will no longer be re-elected. The intention is sincere, and the matter is not hypocritical. Please approve the resignation and [follow] the regulations to replace me. I am deeply honored."</p>

<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, since the Shanghai-Beiping joint transportation of freight trains was implemented, the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai Railway Bureaus have opened joint transportation of freight trains since last month. The joint transportation of goods from various stations on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to various stations on the Longhai Railway, or from various stations on the Longhai Railway to various stations on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, are all attached to the downstream train No. 401 Ping-Hu freight train and the upstream train No. 402 Hu-Ping freight train. Initially, it only reached Zhengzhou Station on the Longhai Railway, but now it has been extended to Tongguan Station. Downstream train No. 403 and upstream train No. 404 are designated as Shanghai-Tongguan joint transportation trains. If the joint transportation goods carried are not enough for one train, they can be attached to the Shanghai-Beiping freight train. For example, the freight train from Shanghai to Tongguan is attached to the No. 402 Hu-Ping freight train and unloaded at Xuzhou Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and then attached to the Longhai Railway freight train to open to Tongguan. The freight train from Tongguan to Shanghai is attached to the No. 401 Ping-Hu freight train and transported to Shanghai after arriving at Xuzhou Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Shanghai and Tongguan depart once a day.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Jianghai Customs Permits Inland Water Vessels to Carry Goods According to Past Practice; After Requesting the Inland Water Vessel Association, the Customs Commissioner Replied and Approved Accommodations <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Inland Water Vessel Industry Association previously reported that the vessels carried goods, and they used to declare to the Jianghai Customs in advance. For the number of items, they usually only declared a certain number of general merchandise. The method has been followed for a long time. Recently, the Jianghai Customs suddenly changed the past practice and not only required the item names to be listed in detail on the total manifest, but also required the number of items to be reported temporarily before customs clearance was allowed. The association believed that although the vessels carried goods, most of them were temporarily brought by passengers. If they were handled in accordance with the regulations, not only would it be impossible in fact, but also it would not be possible in terms of customs clearance time, which would affect the operations of shipping companies. Therefore, the association sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Commissioner and sent personnel to explain the difficulties in person, requesting that the past practice be followed. After that, the association received a reply from Customs Commissioner Borlet, which stated, "The case has been approved in accordance with letter No. 77, which stated that according to the Minnan-Shanghai and other shipping companies, the customs clearance methods for vessels carrying goods have been followed for a long time, and the Jianghai Customs has suddenly changed the past practice, which is inconvenient in fact. It is requested that the past practice be followed. After checking, it is known that these shipping companies only travel to and from inland rivers and do not sail out of Wusong, so it can be approved that only the general situation of the goods needs to be declared on the manifest, and no detailed [registration] is required. However, the inspection procedures stipulated by the customs must be strictly followed. Accordingly, I hope that you will check and inform the shipping companies separately, and provide convenience for them." It is heard that the association has recorded the letter and notified all its member companies to check and handle it.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications originally limited the deadline for dealing with seamen who have not received certificates and seamen who hold a lower-level certificate but hold a higher-level position by the end of June of this year, and had previously ordered the local maritime affairs bureaus to comply and instructed them to inform them. Now, the Ministry of Communications has uniformly extended the deadline to the end of this year due to the fact that the examination procedures for various seamen have not been completed, in order to show consideration. It has telegraphed the local maritime affairs bureaus to inform them. The Municipal Maritime Affairs Bureau informed the shipping association and the joint association of drivers and engineers after receiving the telegram on the morning of the 19th.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications' reply to the Chinese Drivers' Union approving the oral examination in lieu of the written examination was forwarded to the union by the Maritime Affairs Bureau on the 18th of this month. The original text is recorded as follows: "Ministry of Communications Approval No. 1700, the Chinese Merchant Ship Drivers' Union has submitted a document, which is a memorandum of opinions on the examination of seamen, and requests approval. It has been learned that oral examinations have been approved in lieu of written examinations for Class B and Class C seamen, and the purpose of the union's request for accommodation has been achieved. As for the provisional regulations of the 17th year, they have long been revised, and there is no need to discuss the request to continue handling them according to the old regulations. You should immediately be informed." After the union received the approval, it has notified all members so that they can serve with peace of mind.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Li Junshan (Ding Junshan) joined the CY Shanghai West Street Branch after the January 28th Incident in December of the 21st year because he felt that the national affairs were in danger at that time. He temporarily felt the words of his friend Zhou Daokuan, saying that the Communist Party's leadership was based on [illegible]. In the 22nd year, the Jiangsu CY Provincial Committee established a distribution department, and he was transferred to be a cadre of the department. In April, he was transferred to be the head of the distribution department. In May, he contracted enteritis and was hospitalized for surgery. The process was not good, and he almost died in the hospital. In July, the disease was cured, and he resumed his relationship and continued his original work. In November, he lost contact for a long time due to the destruction of the organization. It was not until March of the 23rd year that he resumed work, and it was not until now that he realized and surrendered, and issued a declaration saying, "During my work in the Communist Party, I have become disillusioned with the Communist Party, and I have always thought of breaking away, but I am still bound by moral responsibility and still have no courage. Recently, I was guided and persuaded by my predecessors and comrades of the Kuomintang, and I suddenly realized that my political journey had gone astray. The suffering I have endured in my work is due to the fact that the Communist Party's political theory is wrong and the Communist Party's organization's class struggle. At this critical juncture of China's crisis, it is not only not needed by workers and peasants, and it cannot improve the lives of workers and peasants, but it also creates division and destruction of national unity and the crime of concluding an anti-imperialist united front. Therefore, China not only at present, but also in the future, only requires a national united front to fight against domestic and foreign feudal and imperialist forces, and does not need class struggle. Therefore, I resolutely abandon my past position and work hard under the principle of democracy in the interest of the nation, and stand on the forefront of anti-communism. I hope that people who are wandering in the Communist Party will quickly realize [their mistakes]."</p>

<p>At the current members' congress of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the executive committee proposed to send letters of commendation to the Paper Industry Association and the Copper, Iron and Machinery Industry Association for earnestly promoting domestic goods. The original text is recorded as follows: "Promoting domestic goods is the sole responsibility of this chamber. At this time of high trade deficits and the national economy on the verge of bankruptcy, merchants are the intermediary between production and consumption, and the responsibility for the smooth or blocked sales of domestic goods lies on the shoulders of the business community. Since the third members' congress of this chamber resolved that the work of the chamber from now on should take the promotion of domestic goods as its sole task, it has relied on the leaders of the various associations to earnestly implement it with their colleagues, so that they can benefit the group and love the country, and not rely on empty talk, abide by the covenant and serve the public, and not be ashamed. According to the report of the Executive Committee, they have carefully examined the situation for two years, and in particular, the Paper Industry Association and the Copper, Iron and Machinery Industry Association have been able to supervise the industry, strictly implement the covenant, and not complain where justice lies. They have washed away the habits of procrastination and are worthy of being a model for the business community. Therefore, it was resolved to express its gratitude and commendation in the name of the congress, in order to achieve the effect of making the stubborn and cowardly stand up. We hope that they will increase their enthusiasm and make their reputation last forever. This is what we hope for."</p>

<p>After the strike at the Pudong British-American Tobacco Factory, which has lasted for more than a month, has been mediated by the Party and government agencies, it has not yet been resolved and is still in a stalemate. The association held its eighth strike [illegible] meeting at 4 p.m. yesterday. Thirty-five committee members attended, chaired by Chen Peide, who reported on the petition in Beijing. The result was very satisfactory. The meeting then began to discuss and resolve: (1) The employer has withheld the wages of the old factory workers. In addition to reporting to the superiors, they will send a letter of warning to the board of directors and set a deadline for a reply. (2) Request the Seamen's Union to ask Chairman Yang [Kai-chek] to immediately implement the refusal to load products from the British-American Tobacco Company. Chen Peide, Dong Aosheng, [illegible] Shi Lin, and [illegible] Jingguan will go there. The association also submitted a document to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that the employer be ordered to pay the wages of the old factory workers, which reads: "We, the British-American Tobacco Company, have closed the factory for no reason, triggering a general strike for more than a month. The workers have been cut off [from income] and are in extreme pain. The employer has withheld the wages of the workers of Factory No. 1 from April 15 to May 11, which has made the lives of the workers even more desperate and is about to force them to extremes. Therefore, we respectfully request the [government] to negotiate with the factory and order the wages due to the workers of Factory No. 1 from April 15 to May 12 to be paid in full immediately, so as to obtain temporary relief and avoid other complications. We present this urgent matter and await your inspection and implementation."</p>

<p>At the E Yuen Dog Racing Track on Avenue Albert in the French Concession, on the 9th of this month, at approximately 4 PM, employees Gao Yushu, Mr. Fan, and Mr. Hong, each carrying $6,000 in cash, hired a car to deliver the funds to accountant Xue Mai Luo's office at 9 Avenue Edward VII for accounting purposes. Upon arriving at the destination, Gao and others alighted from the car. Just as they entered the clerical office of Xue Mai Luo's accounting firm, four robbers, well-dressed and with fierce expressions, resembling upper-class individuals, suddenly appeared. Each pulled out a pistol and warned them not to make a sound. They robbed Gao and Fan of $12,000 in cash ($6,000 each), then fled the scene in a rush. The incident was reported to the French police for investigation. Around 6 PM on the 15th, the victim, Gao Yushu, while passing by the Guangxi Road branch of the Good Friends Automobile Company in the Public Concession, spotted one of the robbers entering the car dealership to hire a car. Gao immediately reported this to the French police. Inspector Jin Jiulin and detective Zhang Ziying and others tracked the car to a brothel, where they apprehended the robber, identified as Zhang Zuming, 28 years old, from Ningbo. Zhang confessed that he owned the Ruichangshun Hardware Store at 101 Broadway Road and identified two accomplices: Zhuang Jimeng, 21 years old, from Ningbo, a minor shareholder in the Zhuang Yuan Distilling Company at 42 Avenue Westward, currently serving as a special patrolman in the Public Concession police force (Note: Zhuang Yuan has been in business for decades and is famous far and wide, especially for its Dou Shao wine); and Wang Lianyou, 30 years old, from Ningbo, a hardware broker residing at 931 Xiang Yu Xiang Yu Lane, Avenue du Roi Albert. The detectives then arrested Zhuang and Wang, seizing two pistols, and brought them back to the police station. All three defendants were men of status and wealth. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Li Changnian presided over the hearing. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated that the defendants were arrested for robbery and that the police needed more time to investigate and requested that the defendants be detained for two more weeks to clarify the details of the case before filing charges. Detective Zhang Ziying then reported the circumstances of the arrest. Gao Yushu, 29 years old, from Tianjin, and one of the victims, testified that he worked for Xue Mai Luo’s accounting firm. During the robbery, the first and third defendants entered first, followed by the second defendant and another suspect who is still at large. He recognized the faces of the first defendant and others, and they were the ones who took the cash from him. The plaintiff's lawyer, Yan Luqing, made a statement, requesting to file a private suit to recover the stolen money. The defendants each retained a lawyer. After a brief interrogation, the court adjourned the hearing until the 23rd. The defendants were remanded in custody. The defendants' lawyers requested bail, but the court rejected the request due to the seriousness of the case. It should be noted that the E Yuen Dog Racing Track was robbed of $6,000 on May 13th of last year while sending employees to deliver funds to 9 Avenue Edward VII. One robber was caught and brought to court. This is the second robbery.</p>

<p>The U.S. Silver Purchase Act has been officially passed. Recently, several shipments of silver have been exported from Shanghai to various countries in the United States and England. Yesterday, another large shipment of silver dollars was loaded for the United States. Details are as follows:</p>

<p>After the passage of the U.S. Silver Purchase Act, there is an urgent need to purchase silver to replenish reserves. Foreign banks in Shanghai have recently purchased a large amount of silver from the city and other regions, much of which is in the form of silver dollars, the national currency in circulation, totaling over two million dollars. The export is being kept highly secret. It has been confirmed that the shipment of silver dollars was loaded yesterday from Shanghai and is being directly shipped to New York and San Francisco in the United States for storage.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Quiet Abode Temple Road; Inside Story of Roulette Gambling Den with Many Layers; One Shareholder Takes Gambling Equipment to Tianjin, Fails to Expand; Shanghai Defendants Sentenced Separately; Fugitives Being Hunted by Police <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The roulette gambling den at 204 Jingan Temple Road on Seymour Road was raided by the Jingan Temple police on the night of the 9th of this month, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that the organization of the gambling den was very tight, with a large internal scale. The managers were ostensibly Frenchmen named Sharaineau and Marcel, but in reality, many more Chinese participated, such as Wang Wenan, former manager of the Great China Dance Hall and current shareholder of a certain company, as well as Zhou Sifu, Li Zigang, and others, all of whom were shareholders in the gambling den. Since its establishment, the gambling den has been extremely popular every night, with winnings reaching several million dollars. The amount of losses can often be seen. However, the shareholders were still not satisfied and wanted to expand to Tianjin. Several days before the raid, a certain shareholder was specially dispatched to take the roulette gambling equipment by ship to Tianjin. Unexpectedly, the plan was not kept secret. When the ship arrived in Tianjin, customs officers boarded the ship for inspection and confiscated the gambling equipment. The person carrying the equipment, seeing the failure of the mission and fearing the recriminations from other shareholders in the future, immediately wrote a letter to Wang Wenan. Wang and others were at a loss when the gambling den in Shanghai was also raided, and many employees and gamblers were arrested. Therefore, the escaped shareholders had to retreat and disappear. Among those arrested, besides Sharaineau and two other Frenchmen and five gamblers from Wuxi and three Americans, who were handed over to their respective consulates for investigation, Wang Yaosheng, currently an accountant at the Great Shanghai Dance Hall, as well as Long A’er, Jin A’sheng, and the Russian Su Haier Majialuotian, were handed over to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, charged them with gambling and skimming profits and presented a letter found on Wang Yaosheng from Ding Songquan in Tianjin to Wang Wenan, reporting the seizure of the gambling equipment by Tianjin Customs. After Judge Huang interrogated the defendants, he ordered them to post bail of $5,000 each pending further investigation. Yesterday, Judge Huang continued the hearing and rendered a verdict. Wang Yaosheng and Long A’er were sentenced to one month in prison and fined $500 each. Majialuofuf was fined $500. During the appeal period, Wang and Long each had to post $5,000 bail. A’sheng was found not guilty. When the police conducted the investigation, it was difficult to ascertain the details of the gambling den due to its tight organization. Therefore, the subsequent raid required a lot of effort. However, Wang Wenan and others managed to escape and remain at large. In order to completely eliminate the harm caused by roulette gambling dens, the police authorities are strictly pursuing the fugitives.</p>

<p>Since Russian oil has been actively imported and dumped in China, British and American oil companies have once competed fiercely by drastically lowering prices in order to maintain their market share in China. Later, the three parties, feeling that the losses were too great, formed an agreement and began to raise prices and stop competing. Recently, prices have risen again. Details are as follows:</p>

<p>The four major oil companies in this city, Texaco, Mobil, Oil Fields, and Asiatic Petroleum, in order to recover the losses from the price war in the past two years, formed an agreement to raise prices uniformly. Texaco suddenly broke the agreement in May and lowered prices again, but the other three companies remained united and maintained the original price of $7.20 per gallon while negotiating with Texaco. It is now known that Texaco has restored the original price. At the same time, starting yesterday, all four companies uniformly raised the price to $7.70 per ten gallons. It is said that they plan to continue to raise prices in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Cigarette Lottery Tickets Popular Again in Guangdong Province <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai cigarette factories have petitioned the authorities to stop cigarette companies from replacing lottery tickets with empty packs and offering cash prizes. This was very popular in the city last year, but the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government, which instructed the Social Affairs Bureau and Public Security Bureau to issue a joint ban. At the same time, the Shanghai Cigarette Factory Association held several meetings to discuss the issue, believing that cigarette companies offering prizes was an unfair form of competition that not only did not help sales but also harmed the capital of other companies. They also sent a sincere letter advising them to stop. The Ministry of Finance's Bureau of Unified Taxation also ordered all factories to stop within a time limit and to comply with the following three principles: (1) No lottery tickets may be printed; (2) No cash prizes may be offered; (3) Prizes may not be awarded based on the numbers of officially issued lottery tickets or other tickets. Otherwise, the resident factory officials will be ordered to stop shipping goods. However, recently, the Guangdong province cigarette companies have been replacing lottery tickets with empty packs. It is now heard that various cigarette companies in this city, such as China East and Great East, believe that this not only hinders the promotion of government construction lottery tickets and causes competition among companies but also undermines the authority of the authorities' ban. Therefore, they have jointly petitioned the authorities to ban it immediately to uphold the rule of law.</p>

<h3 id="e179">The Public Works Department Plans to Improve the Conditions of Rickshaws <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Office released a message stating that the department has decided that, starting from January 1st of next year, the maximum rickshaw rental fee will be limited to 80 cents of small silver currency. Compared to the current rental fee, this is a reduction of approximately 60 cents of small silver currency per day. At the same time, to facilitate implementation, it is decided that from August 1st of this year, the rental fee will first be changed to 100 cents of small silver currency, so that rickshaw owners can adapt in their business operations and fully comply with the conditions of the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department has also adopted the recommendation of the Rickshaw Management Office to establish a Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association. The association's finances will be kept independent, but it may also accept donations. At the beginning of its operation, the Public Works Department will appoint three directors (all serving without pay) to supervise the association's funds. These three directors will likely be the current members of the Management Office. In the future, the Public Works Department may reassign them at will. Under the directors, there will be an executive committee (also serving without pay), appointed by the directors, consisting of enthusiastic social workers who will be responsible for handling the association's affairs.</p>
<p>Membership in the Mutual Aid Association will be limited to public rickshaw pullers holding licenses. Once the association's operations can be carried out independently, rickshaw puller members will elect representatives to join the executive committee.</p>
<p>The general outline of the Mutual Aid Association's affairs includes: 1. Providing free medical services (diagnosis and care), either by establishing its own clinic or temporarily entrusting an existing hospital to handle it, with the association paying the fees. 2. Establishing bathhouses. 3. Establishing free dormitories or charging only low rents. 4. Providing education for members and their children. 5. Establishing cooperative stores. 6. Organizing entertainment such as movies. 7. Holding lectures on topics related to members' welfare and rickshaw services. 8. Other matters to be determined as needed.</p>
<p>The association's expenses will be funded by collecting half a small silver currency (5 cents) from each rickshaw shift. This amount will be collected by the rickshaw owners in addition to the rental fee stipulated by the Public Works Department. After being permitted to collect this fee, the rickshaw owners will pay $1.50 in silver currency per rickshaw per month to the Mutual Aid Association. When rickshaw owners apply for license renewal, they must have a receipt for this payment. The Public Works Department will give priority treatment to rickshaw owners who cooperate in granting licenses. This additional fee will be implemented when the rickshaw rental fee is reduced to 100 cents of small silver currency.</p>
<p>The initial work of the Mutual Aid Association will be to assist rickshaw pullers in obtaining rickshaw pulling licenses. In addition, at the beginning of operations, the association's funds may be used for other beneficial purposes. All association funds are purely for the welfare of rickshaw pullers and will not be used for other purposes.</p>
<p>After this plan is implemented, starting from August 1st of this year, rickshaw pullers will pay 100 cents of small silver currency for the rickshaw rental fee and an additional 10 cents of small silver currency as a donation, totaling 110 cents of small silver currency, which is a reduction of 30 cents compared to the current 140 cents. At the same time, rickshaw pullers can obtain all the benefits of the Mutual Aid Association.</p>
<p>Regarding the licensing of rickshaw pullers, the Public Works Department has already decided to instruct rickshaw owners to nominate four rickshaw pullers for each licensed rickshaw. However, the independence of the rickshaw pullers must be fully maintained, and they should also be allowed to apply for licenses directly from the Public Works Department. However, because rickshaw owners must entrust their property to the rickshaw pullers, and in order to ensure that the majority of those who pull rickshaws can still obtain licenses, it is appropriate for rickshaw owners to participate in the selection of rickshaw pullers. It is now decided to handle this in a compromise manner, with rickshaw owners recommending three names per rickshaw, and the remaining 10,000 licenses will be available for rickshaw pullers to apply for themselves.</p>
<p>The Management Office plans to set up rickshaw puller licensing offices in Zhabei (新閘) and Hongkou (虹口). As soon as the buildings are renovated, they will be opened, starting with the licensing of rickshaw pullers for private rickshaws. The Management Office has recently acquired inexpensive land in convenient locations for rickshaw pullers in order to build the Mutual Aid Association's buildings.</p>
<p>On the 15th of this month, the Management Office explained the Mutual Aid Association's plan to a major rickshaw owner in person. The Management Office intends to cooperate in good faith with the rickshaw owners' guild, if possible, in order to realize the reform. It originally intended to hold further talks with several other major rickshaw owners before announcing the Mutual Aid Association's plan. Unfortunately, the result of the talks on that day was the convening of a meeting of rickshaw owners, and at the meeting, the matter of additional donations was criticized as violating the interests of rickshaw pullers and was pointed to as a desire to use it to fund the Management Office. From the current explanation, it can be seen that the criticism is unfounded. However, during the talks on that day, the rickshaw owner strongly expressed his approval of the Mutual Aid Association's plan and, based on his personal business, expressed his willingness to cooperate with the Management Office to see it succeed.</p>
<p>In addition, the Public Works Department's Rickshaw Affairs Committee, due to its radical work, has aroused dissatisfaction among rickshaw merchants and rickshaw pullers regarding the procedures for changing rickshaw styles, collecting rickshaw puller relief funds, and issuing license certificates to rickshaw owners. Currently, more than 1,000 rickshaw owners in the Special District held an emergency general meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and resolved to reject all suggestions and measures of the Public Works Department's Rickshaw Affairs Committee. At 3:00 PM yesterday, Yin Zhiling, Chairman of the Rickshaw Owners' General Meeting, met with Zhong, the Director-General of the Public Works Department, to report the dissatisfaction of the Rickshaw Owners' General Meeting with all the measures of the Public Works Department's Rickshaw Affairs Committee. Director-General Zhong expressed that although the Bureau had agreed to all the suggestions of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, in order to take into account the impossible facts for rickshaw merchants, it had already been revised and would be announced soon, resolving to make the rickshaw pullers' relief association independent and not presided over by the Rickshaw Affairs Committee. Permission will be given for enthusiastic social figures to participate in mutual consultation and cooperation. The relief funds collected must not be used for the expenses of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee. All improved rickshaw styles should also be considered in light of the situation, and gradual changes should be made. Rickshaw merchants need not worry about immediately changing rickshaw styles. Although there are revisions to the rickshaw regulations, the general outline is not much different from the old regulations. It is hoped that you will pass this information on to the rickshaw merchants, reassure them, and not listen to rumors. Yin reported this to the directors of the Special District Rickshaw Merchants' Guild and special committee members that evening for discussion.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Yuan Tai Paper Mill in Xujiahui, Jinyi Bridge, was originally founded by Cheng Linsheng, a prominent Shanghai merchant, and faced the Gen Tai Hehe Flour Mill from afar. The workers in both factories were recruited from the Cangzhou area of Hebei Province. Yuan Tai was established six or seven years ago and originally hired a Japanese engineer to preside over it. After the January 28th Incident, the foreman guided the shipment of goods. Due to poor management, it was intermittently shut down for more than a year, resulting in significant losses. Cheng had no intention of operating it, so he leased it to Liu Bosen, the owner of the Tianzhang Factory, to take over. After Liu took over, he hired a new foreman to recruit new workers. The old workers, who had been unemployed for a long time, were in an uproar. They asked their foreman, Liu Fuxin, to plead with the factory owner for reinstatement, but the factory owner refused. The old workers, with no means of living, were panic-stricken. On the one hand, they forced Liu Fuxin to find a way, and on the other hand, they directly requested from the factory, gathering at the factory gate. The factory then instructed the Public Security Bureau to send police to suppress them. Liu Fuxin again requested the help of the fellow villagers' association to mediate, but it was still unsuccessful. After the original factory owner interceded with the factory, and with the persuasion of Inspector Wang Yan, the opinions of both parties moved closer. Then, Zhao Nangong, Chairman of the Henan Fellow Villagers' Association, invited both parties to the association for formal consultation. The factory owner also sincerely persuaded the workers, and the opinions were completely eliminated. The method was drafted, and the factory made revisions. Both parties recognized it, and the mediation was signed on the spot, establishing the resolution peacefully after a nearly month-long turmoil. The conditions are recorded as follows: 1. The Senji Factory and the office will hire 15 people, and Tianzhang will hire 15 people. The wages will be determined by the employer, and the workers may not dispute them. 2. If the workers hired by Tianzhang do not violate the factory rules, the factory will maintain their work for one year. If they are indeed good and are dismissed by the factory owner, the factory owner will grant them wages for the remaining months, calculated according to one year, excluding the days already worked. 3. Senji is willing to pay $1,000 to Mr. Zhao Nangong of the Hebei Fellow Villagers' Association as travel expenses for 40 dismissed workers to return home. 4. If workers hired by Senji and Tianzhang commit violations of factory rules, the factory has the right to dismiss them at any time and is not responsible for the wages stipulated in Article 2. 5. The entire group should apologize to the factory and the injured workers. 6. The above mediation conditions are guaranteed by the Hebei Fellow Villagers' Association to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Yesterday, ten refugees, including Mr. and Mrs. Li Ruan, originally from various places in Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces, who were disaster victims who came to Shanghai last winter to beg for food and have been here for half a year, learned that their hometowns had all calmed down and wanted to return home, but were suffering from a lack of travel expenses. Yesterday, Mr. Li and others went to the Xinwei Relief Society in this port to state their situation and begged to be sent back to their hometowns so that they could make a living and avoid drifting in a foreign land for a long time. The society, based on the request, made inquiries one by one. Ge Junxun and Chen Hongyou, two directors, separately issued ten wheel tickets and ordered the servant to send them to the China Merchants Wharf, where they boarded a steamer at 8:00 AM yesterday morning to return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>In addition, the Jiangsu Second Prison, with thousands of prisoners, had a sudden outbreak of plague, and the weather was hot, so it requested the Xinwei Relief Society to allocate medicine for relief.

<p>Yifeng Lane, located on Zhifu Road, Guizhou Road, in the Public Concession, is owned by the Jewish Yifeng Foreign Firm and was built in 1932. The rent is higher than in other places, so there are many empty houses, and they have not been completely rented out to this day. The residents of the lane, due to the current commercial depression and economic exhaustion, have reduced both food and clothing expenses. However, the rent has not yet reached the goal of reduction. For this reason, they invited all the residents of the lane to hold a general meeting yesterday, and Yang Zhongfu was publicly elected as chairman. Ren Nongxuan was sent by the General Association for Rent Reduction to supervise, and Zheng Xiaolin was sent by the 35th District Branch to guide. It was unanimously resolved to pay rent at 70% of the General Association's rate. If Yifeng Foreign Firm refuses to accept it, it will be deposited in the bank to await resolution, and a letter will be sent to Yifeng Foreign Firm requesting a rent reduction.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Case Against the Doctor at the Shangxian Church Women and Children's Hospital Was Adjudicated Yesterday; The Court Ruled That There Was No Negligence <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Two years ago, Mrs. Shen Li had an abortion and suffered from continuous bleeding. She went to the hospital for treatment, and Dr. Zhu performed the operation, which resulted in a good outcome. Therefore, she still went to the hospital for childbirth this year. After the lady was admitted to the hospital, there was no sign of labor for six days, everything was normal, only that she had a slight water discharge at home. During this period, the cervix did not open, and there was no need for surgery. On the seventh day, she naturally went into labor, but the contractions were weak and the progress was slow. This day happened to be a Sunday, and there was only one doctor in the hospital, so Dr. Zhong, the original introducer, was invited to consult. After the research, it was not yet the time to perform surgery. The next day, Dr. Lan, Director of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Red Cross General Hospital, was invited to come for a diagnosis in the morning. Dr. Lan believed that she could not start yet. It was not until 7:00 PM that Dr. Lan came again to perform the surgery himself. The surgery was very difficult. After the fetus was delivered, the placenta adhered to the uterine wall and could not come down on its own, so it had to be removed with surgery. However, after removal, the uterus contracted weakly, resulting in continuous bleeding. Gauze was used to fill it, and injections of uterine contraction drugs and cardiotonics, as well as saline, were all ineffective. This kind of postpartum hemorrhage was actually caused by weak uterine contraction, which led to death. Afterwards, her husband, Shen Wenda, was very sad, but he had no complaints against the doctor. Unexpectedly, a month later, he sued doctors Ge and Zhu in the Second Special District Court for manslaughter due to negligence. After the court summoned them, the facts were very clear. The plaintiff twice claimed to be ill and did not appear. Yesterday, the verdict was announced that the two doctors were not negligent.</p>

<p>Reading and Answering Questions</p>
<h3 id="e197">How to Learn to Write Letters丨Reply to Mr. Jiang Ziyu丨 <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>We used to say that whatever we learn should not be separated from real life, because this can increase the interest in learning and prevent what we learn from being impractical.</p>
<p>This opinion has recently gained the agreement of many readers. Take the readers who discuss the issue of learning writing skills with us. In the past, they discussed learning essays, short articles, novels, poems, dramas, etc. Their method of practicing writing was to arbitrarily create two topics to work on, just like teachers in schools assign compositions to students. The purpose was purely to practice writing techniques. Later, they realized that taking this path was unrealistic, because their own ordinary daily-use writing skills were not even sufficient, and immediately talking about creation was divorced from the practice of life and could not succeed. It would be better to start with letters and diaries, which can be used every day in daily life, and then talk about writing longer pieces later. Because writing letters is both a practice and an application in real life. Learning writing in this direction is of course the most practical. But at the same time, new problems have arisen. They don't know what kind of model to adopt for practice. We have already discussed how to write diaries, so now let's talk about how to write letters!</p>
<p>Based on the books that readers have indicated to us as models for letter writing, they can be roughly divided into two categories: one is classical letters, such as "Xiaocangshanfang Letters," "Qiushuixuan Letters," "Xuehongxuan Letters," etc.; and the other is the most popular vulgar letters, such as "Classified Letters Grand View," "Interpersonal Relations Complete Book," "Rewarding the World Brocade," etc. There are more than these two categories of classical Chinese letters, but most readers only choose these two, which is not accidental. Old-style letters in our country can be divided into three styles. One is the simple letters of the Jin Dynasty, which were mostly used by poets and literati. These letters must have a free and unconventional, elegant and appropriate flavor, otherwise, they would be worthless. This kind of thing is not easy to learn, so it is only popular among scholars. The punctuated and typeset edition of "Su Huang Letters," which has been widely reprinted recently, belongs to this category. Since this kind of letter focuses on elegance, it is naturally not suitable for us ordinary people to emulate. The second type is parallel-prose letters, which were most popular in the officialdom in the past. The style of secretaries was almost always used by subordinates when writing to superiors, because as long as the writing was rich in rhetoric, properly arranged, neatly paired, and sonorous in tone, it was considered superior, and the emptiness of content could be ignored. Superiors had nothing to commend, but in fact, it was necessary to do so. Helpless, they could only use this rotten tune. Now that it is not very popular in officialdom, and we don't need to write "donation appeals" or "essay contests" for others, there are very few people who learn it now. The last type is classical prose letters, which are written in prose. This kind of letter is still used by scholars who admire classical Chinese for communication, but ordinary people rarely use it. It takes a lot of effort to learn these three types of letter writing, and now they are too far removed from our actual lives. Classical letters are based on the social existence of the scholar-officials of feudal society. Their leisurely lives allowed them to show off their rhetoric, which was an elegant thing in their time. If we were to imitate them now, it would be a waste of time and ambition.</p>
<p>Even in letters written in classical prose, there are some works with substantial content, but we still do not recommend that readers take them as models for practicing letter writing, and we do not want readers to adopt this style. The reason is the same as why we must use vernacular Chinese instead of classical Chinese now. The advantage of letter writing over other articles is that it can more truthfully express the author's personal temperament, thoughts, and humor. There is always a bit of affectation in writing other articles, but letter writing is the most naked and straightforward. Therefore, letter writing should use living language. If you use classical Chinese, even if you have the ability to write classical Chinese, it will never be as natural and real as using the language of living people today.</p>
<p>But now the most popular type of letter is the classified letter style, and the book list opened by readers in their letters is mostly this type of book. But it is the most vulgar and rotten thing. The reason why it can have a wide impact on the public is because classical letters are difficult to learn and cannot be emulated by the general public, while it turns some classics into a set of patterns and formats, making it easy for people to copy according to the formula. This type of letter not only mechanically divides the letter into several parts, but also opens up a formula for each part, and arranges it properly according to the social relations of people from "all walks of life." This kind of thing is also inferior in old-style letters. Only people who don't know any better would copy it, and there are many jokes that come out of it! Therefore, although these things are still popular at the moment, they are really not suitable as models for learning letter writing. (To be continued)</p>

<p>In the first set, Pouces attacked back and forth, and Crawford was unable to resist. In the second set, the momentum changed. Crawford felt the danger, was careful, and the momentum became active.

In the third and fourth sets, McLaren attacked from left and right, making the enemy run around in a hurry, and won a great victory. According to this competition, France originally had the possibility of winning. On the first day, Pouces was defeated by McGrath. The next day's doubles, the veteran Brunignon and Baudot also failed, which was unexpected.</p>

It can add a new record in sports history. Unfortunately, the Association's field has been taken back, and the city's sports field is starting the tennis season and does not allow borrowing. It is impossible to change it to Hongkou Park. The discus and javelin events cannot be held due to the restrictions of the park's rules. In order to increase the interest in the competition, it is stipulated that all Far East representatives and Shanghai athletes attending the National Games are not allowed to participate.</p>

<h3 id="e222">The Classical Chinese Movement in Primary and Secondary Schools (II) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Maozu</p>
<p>"To make the Chinese nation a people of great benevolence, wisdom, and courage, we must first establish the foundation of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness, and then seek its deficiencies in knowledge and skills. We should value martial arts to prepare for military qualifications and emphasize practicality to warn against the frivolous and superficial customs of the end of the dynasty. We must possess loyalty, taking patriotism as the prerequisite, and cultivate determination, taking idleness as the greatest taboo. Those who say this should be ashamed of being inferior to others." These words came from Yuan Shikai. All those who say this after Yuan Shikai are Yuan Shikai. Moreover, our country's historical relics are all legacies of the feudal era, and should be regarded with as little regard as "boundless trees shedding their leaves, rustling down." Then it is no wonder that students' minds today are chaotic and unable to distinguish between black and white. How can we expect scientific progress? The impact of enlightening students with such thoughts is significant, and it is not merely a debate between vernacular and classical Chinese.</p>
<p>(III) Mr. Wu argues that prohibiting the study of classical Chinese is not the personal opinion of a few, and lists the previous Ministry of Education, the former University Council, and the current Ministry of Education, citing the opinions of many ministers, vice ministers, and ministry members, who have advocated prohibiting primary schools from studying classical Chinese. These grand decrees are not something that a few people can take over." I do not know if this is precisely evidence of the opinion of the few. As for the decrees of the ministry, we who serve in the education sector should obey them. If we still promote "administrative academicization," then I dare not remain silent. Moreover, not all ministers agree with Mr. Wu. Only the former Vice Minister Liu Jun Dabai advocated the vernacular most strongly, creating strange terms such as "human language (vernacular) ghost language (classical Chinese)" to suppress public opinion. At that time, Mr. Wu was able to express his aspirations greatly, but Mr. Liu is now deceased, and classical Chinese has not died with him. The current Minister Wang Jun is knowledgeable and erudite, but his skills are specialized, and his efforts are focused on long-term goals. He may not have a strong interest in what we are debating. What I hope for from Mr. Wang is that he can correct the mistakes of his predecessors. If it is said that the grand decrees cannot be easily changed, then there have been countless instances of the Ministry's decrees being amended or revoked. If he accepts falsehoods and errors and sits idly by while they flow downstream, I fear for this. The mistakes of a gentleman are like the eclipse of the sun and moon, and people look up to him when he corrects them. This is true of individuals, and it should be true of the government. If the current officials of the Ministry of Education do not believe the opinions of men of letters and scholars, please investigate the needs of the professions, and you will surely know that what I say is not without reason.</p>
<p>With the the order of, also from the school principals primary school principals who know who has violated the order, and more troublesome to the Ministry's, reading the classics is by no means a bad thing, it seems today to make the provincial authorities how Chen advocated the scriptures can be</p>
<p>Mr. Wu, under that, China talent, to add column, educators are not just, educators, fortunately note.</p>
<p>(IV) It is of course good that primary schools use vernacular teaching materials, but are the stories of birds and animals, and the absurd and fantastical tales, consistent with the intention of most departments to promote science? This can still be explained by children's interests. It is not appropriate to use them in the first and second grades of primary school, in order to arouse children's interest. The use of such materials must be deeply enlightening. As for indicative matters and names, there is no need for this. If cats, dogs, chickens, and sheep eat, dress, and speak, it is permissible to use chapters to amuse children. This is what is called a sugar-coated interest. Dewey also criticized its inappropriateness. Allegorical teaching materials can certainly be without stories, but the attitude must be if cats are also called gentlemen, children's thoughts will be deceived by this kind of humor. No true friends. Recently, a friend's child, in the first grade of a certain primary school, one day, the grade taught the story of monsters eating people, ordering two children to dress up as monsters in another room. The teacher led the entire class to drive away the monsters, and some children were frightened and cried. The purpose of this lesson was to cultivate a fearless spirit, but the children did not know what monsters were, so they were deliberately given terrible stimulation to arouse their instinct of fear, and the result was the opposite of the purpose. Is this how education should be?</p>
<p>Recently, I happened to find the following excerpt from the 14th lesson of the fourth volume of the Elementary School Chinese Textbook published by a certain bureau:</p>
<p>Three Little Squirrels</p>
<h3 id="e223">(I) Looking at Clothes <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>There are three little squirrels, one called Red Tail, one called Blue Eyes, and one called Yellow Fur. They know that Children's Day is coming soon, and they are discussing what clothes to wear to school for the meeting.</p>
<p>Red Tail took out a red coat, sighed, and said, "I always wear red coats. It's really annoying. I want to choose another color." Blue Eyes took out a blue jacket, shook his head, and said, "I've worn this blue jacket too. It's best to change to another color." Yellow Fur took out a yellow cheongsam and said, "I also hate this yellow cheongsam. It would be best if I could change to another color."</p>
<p>Red Tail said, "Let's ask Miss Butterfly. The color of her clothes is the best. Maybe she will tell us how to change colors." Blue Eyes and Yellow Fur both said, "Great, great!" They decided and went to Miss Butterfly's house to find her.</p>
<p>(II) Changing Colors</p>
<p>The three squirrels found Miss Butterfly and discussed with her how to change the colors.</p>
<p>The butterfly thought for a day and then flapped its wings and said, "I have an idea! There are several ponds behind the forest. You take your clothes and wash them, and maybe they will change color."</p>
<p>They listened and went to find the ponds. They found three ponds, one with yellow water, one with red water, and one with blue water. Red Tail's red coat, each squirrel took their own clothes to wash. Red Tail's red coat was washed in the yellow water pond, Blue Eyes' blue jacket was washed in the red water pond, and Yellow Fur's yellow cheongsam was washed in the blue water pond. In less than five minutes, they said, they took the clothes up and wrung them dry. Red Tail looked and jumped up and said, "Oh, it really changed! My red coat has become the color of orange peel." Blue Eyes was also very surprised, tilted his tail, and said, "Look, my blue jacket has also changed. It's purple, how beautiful!" Yellow Fur looked at her cheongsam and said, "Look, hasn't it changed too? This is green."</p>
<p>Everyone was very happy to see it.</p>
<p>(III) Changing Names</p>
<p>On Children's Day, the three little squirrels wore beautiful clothes and came to school for the meeting. Red Tail wore an orange coat, Blue Eyes wore a purple jacket, and Yellow Fur wore a green cheongsam.</p>
<p>The children saw them and seemed not to recognize them. Everyone said, "The clothes worn by these three girls are really beautiful!"</p>
<p>At the potluck, the three little squirrels told the children about how they changed the color of their clothes.</p>
<p>The main point here, in addition to seeking special colors and explaining the principles of color matching and color matching, is to know what kind of feelings it can evoke. If Children's Day is explained from the children's own perspective, it will be more authentic. Why create monsters like Red Tail and Green Eyes? Changing clothes to attend meetings and potlucks, it's as if today's textbooks require all kinds of knowledge to come from the mouths of various animals. This is also strange. The United States also has a faction that vigorously exaggerates the value of myths and stories, which is called the Romantic School. The romantic textbooks in our country are not seen as romantic. The accumulation of errors can become right. This is why Confucius hated purple for taking away from vermilion.</p>
<p>(V) Dewey advocated "education is life" and deeply criticized the preparation of life. This meaning is often misunderstood, leading to an overemphasis on children's lives and indifference to their future needs. In fact, Dewey's education is life. The meaning does not contain the intention of preparation. What he opposed was teaching children completely from the perspective of adults. It is a pity that Mr. Dewey's criticism of "preparing for life" was excessive, resulting in great abuses, which was not expected. The period of compulsory education in various countries is relatively long, and it is still possible to calmly focus on children's lives. If our country's compulsory education is only four years, it is still unattainable. In these four years, it seems appropriate to pay more attention to "preparation." All social needs should be emphasized, and the rural environment should be considered. The current textbooks focus on the lives of urban children, which is not reasonable, and the words that are rarely used in society are found in the first volume, such as the 10th and 11th lessons of a certain bureau's textbook.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Old Hen "Cluck, cluck, cluck" Little Chicken "Cheep, cheep, cheep" <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>How many times will these two words " and " " be used in a lifetime, and must we first teach them to recognize them? In my opinion, this type of textbook, even the vernacular in the lower grades, must be rewritten before it can be used.</p>
<p>In society, there is opposition to storybooks. I initially thought that the words of men of letters and scholars were not credible, so I ignored them. Returning to my hometown last year for inspection, I realized that this type of textbook is even more opposed in rural areas, and everyone says that studying in private schools is useful. A few days ago, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs convened a vocational guidance meeting, with representatives from agriculture, industry, and commerce attending. They all advocated that classical Chinese must be taught in senior primary schools, and some even supported private schools. From an educational perspective, we cannot be too accommodating to the environment. However, in the thirty years since the establishment of modern schools, private schools have not only not been eliminated but have also been on the rise. This is also enough to cause us to reflect deeply. This is why I wrote this article. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e225">Records of Imperial Incense's Vague Fragrance <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I said: "Really, the weather is too cold! It's time to wear fur coats! Ancestor." (Translator's note: It is said that Princess Rong Ling said: The people in the palace originally called Empress Dowager Cixi the Old Buddha, but later, because Emperor Kangxi also had the title of "Old Buddha" on that day, it was changed to Ancestor. This reference is very appropriate.) "I think it's perfectly fine to wear fur coats tomorrow. Why doesn't the Empress Dowager issue an imperial edict now?"</p>
<p>What luck! Not only did these few words of mine not offend her, but they immediately gained her sympathy. Thus, the imperial edict "From tomorrow onwards, everyone must wear fur coats" was issued without delay.</p>
<p>The next day, throughout the entire territory of the Manchu Qing Empire, as long as there were officials and noblewomen who were qualified to wear fur coats, they all put them on. And my new dress instantly became the most fashionable and eye-catching winter outfit! I thought: When the weather was so cold, if I hadn't taken this courageous action, others wouldn't have been able to wear fur coats even if they wanted to. How grateful would they be to me!</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I thought, all for the sake of my wanting to wear that new dress with fur trim, I urged the Empress Dowager to issue the edict to wear fur coats. After this edict was issued, I don't know how many people were kept busy all night!</p>
<p>When I was in the palace, every day there were many new clothes. Some eunuchs put them on wooden trays and carried them in for the Empress Dowager to see. There were always many tailors supported in the palace, and these tailors absolutely dared not be lazy. Therefore, the Empress Dowager's new clothes were being made continuously. However, this time when she went to Fengtian, she did not bring those tailors along.</p>
<p>In the palace, there was also a group of elderly women with a long history and mysterious movements. They ate their fill all day long and did no work. They just lowered their heads every day and held pens to draw patterns for the Empress Dowager's new shoes. This time, the Empress Dowager did not load them onto the boat to Fengtian either. (62)</p>
<h3 id="e226">Chaozhou Opera <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Ling</p>
<p>People in Shanghai are probably very unfamiliar with Chaozhou opera, right? Although there are some Chaozhou songs on records, the "ee-ee-yah-yah" tunes are not only unfamiliar to Shanghai people, but I don't think anyone would enjoy listening to them, let alone understand them!</p>
<p>Recently, a group of Chaozhou opera performers came to Shanghai and have been performing in a certain theater in the French Concession for more than ten days.</p>
<p>I didn't have time to listen to them, even though I can understand them. So I estimate that most of the people who specially went to a certain theater to listen to Chaozhou opera are those Chaozhou people living in Shanghai, especially a group of idle old ladies and young women.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, I was very enthusiastic about Chaozhou opera. Before the play even started, I would often run backstage and peek through the railing at the "opera teacher" teaching the actors.</p>
<p>What makes Chaozhou opera most special from other places is that the actors in Chaozhou opera are all children aged seven or eight to fifteen or sixteen, the so-called "child actors." These children are bought by the opera troupe owners for a few hundred yuan, or someone hands the child over to the opera troupe, specifying the years. When the term is up, the child can gain freedom.</p>
<p>The "opera teacher" is also hired by the owner, and his power is the greatest. When teaching children to act, if they do not meet his expectations, he will not be polite with bamboo boards and whips. Sometimes, a child who has been acting for several years becomes disabled when he regains his freedom. This is not uncommon. Even if they are not disabled, but have been suppressed for several years, once they come to society, they have no ability to work and end up wandering as vagrants. Otherwise, they can only live as "street singers" like beggars.</p>
<p>However, it is said that this kind of tragic phenomenon is now relatively rare!</p>
<h3 id="e227">A Scene of Seeking a Child <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>The bricklayer Wang from the same street is almost forty years old this year, but he still doesn't have a single child. Although the bricklayer Wang's wife has prayed to gods and temples, burned incense and made vows, and stolen the little clay dolls in front of the Child-Giving Goddess, but year after year has passed, the belly of the bricklayer Wang's wife is still flat and has not bulged up. This clearly shows that the bricklayer Wang's efforts to seek a child have failed just like this year's Women's National Goods Year!</p>
<p>The more the bricklayer Wang's wife's belly doesn't bulge, the more the bricklayer Wang hopes it will bulge, and the more urgent the thought of wanting it to bulge becomes. Probably last month, the bricklayer Wang implemented another kind of child-seeking work, dragging his wife across seven ditches, which is indeed an interesting piece of news.</p>
<p>The fact is like this: I don't know which day last month, the bricklayer Wang invited several colleagues and waited in an open space. And the bricklayer Wang himself? He tricked his wife into coming. Taking advantage of her unpreparedness, he suddenly pushed her down. Then his colleagues, one person grabbing one of her feet, desperately dragged her forward. While dragging, they asked her "Are you going to have a child?" "Are you going to have a child?" His wife was too embarrassed to say that she would, so she ignored them. The bricklayer Wang was really anxious at this time, fearing that he would fall short of success, so he forced her to say it. Although she was shy, she finally succumbed because of her husband's coercion and the pain in her back. And she said: "I'm going to have a child!" "I'm going to have a child!" Only then did she lower her head and run home in the cheers of the crowd. But four or five pieces of skin had been scraped off her back! And she didn't come out for half a month because of this incident.</p>

<p>Chapter 30: Seeing the Wretched Wild Geese Off, He Buried Himself in Defending the Territory; A Bullet Pierced a Strong Arm, Dyeing the Blood Red</p>
<p>Zi Qiang called the squad leader over in the starlight and cold wind, said a few words himself, and immediately came to the battalion headquarters. In Fang's office, two foreign candles were already lit on the clay brick table. He unfolded a military map in the candlelight. He pressed it with both hands, bent down, and was standing there looking at it. Zhao Ziqiang saluted and stood still in the candlelight. Bao Fang said: Wait a moment, I have orders. As he spoke, the other three company commanders came one after another. Bao Fang straightened his body and issued the order in a clear tone: According to reports, enemy reconnaissance teams have been detected fifteen li outside Ping'an Fort. The enemy seems to be planning to invade our North Gate by detouring. The first company of this battalion will set off immediately, exit the North Gate, and defend the first line of trenches. Taking advantage of the darkness and unpreparedness, wait for the enemy to approach and use extremely powerful artillery fire to resolutely resist. The third and fourth companies will immediately go to the fort city to defend and await orders to attack. The second company will await orders to attack at the company headquarters. I will be at the battalion headquarters. After he finished, the company commanders received their orders, saluted, and withdrew. Guan Yaowu, Yin Deren, and Tian Qing, the three company commanders, each had their own missions. Only Zhao Ziqiang did not set off but waited for orders at the company headquarters. Yin Deren was in the first company. When he returned to his company headquarters, he blew his whistle and gathered all the soldiers in the company to stand in formation. Under the starlight, he used a flashlight to shine on the roster and called their names. Then he gave a lecture to all the soldiers in the company: Brothers, now is our opportunity to work hard to kill the bandits. We have received reports that there are very few enemies, not even a company's worth, coming to attack our defensive positions. This situation is clearly a contempt for our uselessness. As the saying goes, a proud army is bound to be defeated. What is a proud army? It is being unbearably arrogant and not caring about anyone. Don't mention soldiers facing battle, even if we are private individuals, if we don't care about anything, won't we suffer? I know that all the brothers in my company are heroes, and we must not let people despise us. The enemy thinks that we are also those hopeless soldiers who, when they hear the word "dwarf," will run away with their tails between their legs. Therefore, they are using few people and have come to闯 over. (413)</p>
<h3 id="e230">Tasting Dung <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Shude</p>
<p>I remember when I was in the capital, my neighbor Ding Jirong's wife could be considered a first-class shrew in the city. She usually abused her parents-in-law the most. When her husband returned, she would complain and say that it was her parents-in-law who were wrong. Her husband was a businessman, quite literate, and also knew something about filial piety. However, after being influenced by this shrew for a long time, sometimes his filial piety would change and he would follow the wind, just to please his wife. One day, her husband returned and heard her say that her parents-in-law were wrong again. Her husband had no choice but to give her an answer that he didn't quite believe, thinking that this would be the end of it. Who knew that she thought that her husband was not helping her, so she took advantage of people's unpreparedness, tidied herself up, and lay stiffly on the bed, half-opening and half-closing her eyes, without making a sound. Her husband inadvertently entered the room and, seeing this situation, was so frightened that his soul left his body. He hurriedly called for his parents and neighbors, relatives, and so on, shouting loudly and softly, but she still didn't make a sound. In the end, everyone carefully inspected her and found that she was missing an earring from her left ear. Everyone thought that she had swallowed gold to kill herself. The neighbors knew about her usual behavior, so they all said in unison that dung juice should be poured into her stomach from her mouth. The gold would be vomited out. At this time, she became anxious and tossed and turned on the bed, refusing to taste the smelly dung. Everyone didn't say a word, and tied her up with seven hands and eight feet, pried open her teeth, and poured about a cigarette can of dung juice into her mouth. In the end, nothing was vomited out. I interrupted and pretended to say that I had seen this trick in Shanghai and simply threatened her, saying: "Unless you find foreigners to cut open your stomach, there's no way." She was extremely frightened and搶抢抢 said, "Don't, I was just trying to scare my husband. I had hidden the earring under the floor in advance." Only then did the family slowly put down the stone in their hearts.</p>

<h3 id="e231">On Dogs (Continued) <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Feeding utensils must be kept clean. Each feeding should provide an even amount of food; do not overfeed. For puppies around three months old, feed five to seven times a day. At five months, feed four to five times. At seven months, feed three to four times. For a one-year-old dog, feed twice a day, morning and evening. Puppies are naturally innocent and love to chew on stones and wood chips. Normally, you can give them some charcoal and beef bones to gnaw on, to prevent them from chewing on stones and damaging their digestive system. Each time you feed them, you can teach them various tricks, such as standing, sitting, lying down, and somersaulting. To prevent the accumulation of dirt in their fur, you should regularly brush them clean. In summer, bathe them every other day. (4) Considerations for Nursing: If puppies are born to your own female dog, they usually open their eyes around ten days old, and can see things around twenty days old, and can also stand. Between twenty and thirty days after birth, their milk teeth gradually grow, and their claws become sharp. The mother dog's nipples are often bitten by their teeth or scratched by their claws, and she gradually becomes averse to them nursing. After fifty days, the amount of breast milk decreases, and gradually feed them easily digestible foods. For the first week after birth, puppies should not be exposed to excessive external stimuli or extreme cold or heat. The temperature of the food and the surroundings of the doghouse should not be too hot or too cold. After twenty days, they can walk. At this time, they will certainly like to lie in the sun to get plenty of sunshine, in order to promote development. If there are any that cannot develop due to their tail, then depending on the breed of dog, the tail can be cut off. (5) Exercise: The owner should often take the dog outside for walks every day and never keep it indoors all day long, which is too restrictive and causes it to lose its natural instincts. Schedule a certain trick to teach them every day, cycling through them. This can help them exercise and also practice their skills. As rain is something dogs hate the most, their food intake should be reduced to avoid indigestion. (6) Nursing When Sick: Because we are in daily contact with dogs, we can easily understand their constitution and nature, the condition of their feces, and the state of their spirit. If the body is thin, when sleeping, they try to get up and walk, but after walking a few steps, they want to lie down again. Their food intake decreases, their noses are very dry, or they have nasal discharge, or they cough, have difficulty breathing, have a lot of eye discharge, the whites of their eyes look bloodshot, or they are pale due to anemia, their abdomen is swollen, their feces are thin, or they often vomit, or they are losing hair, these are signs of illness. However, the origins of dog diseases are often when the weather is warm and hot, when fleas, lice, mosquitoes, and other pests are most abundant, or during the humid plum rain season. During this period, the dog's life functions gradually change, skin diseases may occur, and parasites may enter the stomach and intestines through food, and various diseases follow. The most serious diseases are distemper, heart disease (Detenber), pneumonia, and common cold cough. These diseases are often fatal. Chinese people have traditionally not valued dogs. Once they get sick, they only use bird medicine. Based on my experience raising dogs, if they have a cold or cough, you can give them medicines to relieve the exterior and stop coughing, but the medicinal liquid is very difficult to administer. It is best to buy powder and administer it from the corner of the mouth. This is what my veterinarian friend taught me. He said that the life functions of dogs are originally the same as those of humans, and ordinary diseases can be completely treated according to the methods of treating people. Later, I repeatedly verified this through trials. When sick, the food fed should be nutritious, liquid, and easily digestible. If a dog has rickets, it should be fed more foods rich in Vitamin D and Calcium (Calcium, a silvery-white metallic element, a nourishing supplement). However, dogs hate things with a bad smell. You can mix the medicine with cream and their favorite food, so that they can take it.</p>

<p>Yesterday, although there were no fluctuations in the overseas silver market, reports indicated that India was willing to cooperate with the U.S. government to promote silver coinage in the hope of raising the price of silver. Foreign dispatches also stated that the silver bill had been signed by the U.S. President. The market was sluggish today. In the morning, with no ups or downs in the British and American overseas silver markets, the prices of forward silver on the Precious Metals Exchange showed mixed signals of rise and fall, exchange rates contracted, London gold was flat, U.S. cotton fell slightly, and U.S. wheat rose by 0.75. Stocks showed mixed rises and falls. Both Sin Fung Hong and Reuters reported that President Roosevelt would sign or had already signed the silver bill. Preliminary trading retreated to 13.04 taels. After the opening, the situation was flat and weak. Then, because the domestic market went from flat to slightly tight, Guang Bang (Cantonese merchants) in the market continued to purchase strips, gradually turning stable. Later, banks showed an appetite to buy, and the buying trend in the market was slightly strong, pushing up the price of gold. News of a decrease of 0.375.25 in the overnight silver market in Seattle and no movement stabilized the market, hovering around 5 taels. When Reuters again sent details of U.S. President Roosevelt's signing of the silver bill, sentiment suddenly weakened, supply exceeded demand, and speculator Mr. Wu also supplied, causing a temporary decline. Ultimately, because the domestic market was still good, and there were eager buyers at the lower price, the noon market was stable. In the afternoon, news came of no movement in the overnight silver market in Seattle and a rebound of 0.375.25, but a Reuters report stated that Roosevelt might postpone the signing of the silver bill until 8:45 p.m. Banks' appetite was relatively strong, and the market opened firmly, but sentiment was uncertain. News of a rise in Bombay sparked a renewed sell-off, causing a further decline. Subsequently, there were few transactions, and the market fluctuated. The foreign exchange market was also flat, resulting in a quiet close, with a slight decline before closing. The price of refined gold was 1022.3 taels, and swaps were still offered by short sellers at a premium of 5 to 10 candareens. Here is a record of today's market situation: The morning opening was 1023.3 taels, a decrease of 1.8 taels from the previous close. Articles opened at 3.2 taels. The morning foreign exchange market saw near-term selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling, 3 pence, 6875, and U.S. exchange at 33.03125 taels. Heng Yu, Gan Chang Xiang, Tong Tai Chang, and others sold strips in the market. Macgary settled August U.S. dollars at 0.1875, retreating from 3.5 to 2.6 candareens. Preliminary indications were that HSBC's listed prices for British and American exchange were flat, stabilizing the situation. Da De Cheng vigorously purchased, rebounding to 4.3 candareens. Banks were still bidding, and the Dalian Bang (Dalian merchants) supplied, lowering the price to 3.5 candareens. But Heng Xing's vigorous buying pushed British exchange for July to 0.0625, then rising to 4.8 candareens. Heng Yu, Yu Qing, Yong Da Xing, Yong Ding Kang, and others vigorously supplied strips, retreating to 3.7 candareens. After entering the market, Citibank accepted September U.S. dollars at 0.1875. Yu Qing, Yong Yuan Chun, Fu An Yuan Chang Yong, and others advanced to 5.4 candareens. Fu Xing Yong Bing Xing Heng Yuan Mao Yong tended to supply strips at high prices, falling once to 4.5 candareens. But Yuan Chang Yong's buying interest remained strong, and Heng Chang Yong also purchased, rising again to 5.4 candareens. At this time, the news of a reduction of 0.375 in the overnight silver market in Seattle stabilized sentiment, hovering around 5 candareens. The Yokohama Specie Bank settled July U.S. dollars at 33 taels. A Reuters report stated that President Roosevelt had signed the silver bill, prompting Da De Cheng, Zheng Chang, Hui Xiang, and others to sell, undermining sentiment. Rumors spread that Mr. Wu was also selling, causing a decline to 3.1 candareens. Banks still accepted September U.S. dollars at 0.25. The Dalian Bang and Fu Chang Zhao Feng Chang Lai advanced, rising again to over 4 taels. The noon close was 1014.1 taels, and articles were auctioned at 4 candareens.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1013.8 taels, and articles opened at 3.9 candareens. Although the overnight silver market in Seattle rose by 0.375, a Reuters report stated that President Roosevelt had changed the signing of the silver bill to 8:45 p.m. tonight, stabilizing the market. Shun Mao Heng Yu, Gan Chang Xiang, and others advanced. Macgary ate October U.S. dollars at 0.3125, rising to 4.8 candareens. Then, news came of a rise of 3 annas in Bombay, and articles Da De Cheng Heng Yu and others sold strips, gradually retreating to 3.4 candareens. The Yokohama Specie Bank still bid for October U.S. dollars at 0.3125, Citibank bid for August at 0.125, Heng Yu and Fu An bought, rising to 4.3 candareens. Thereafter, it hovered around 4 candareens. When Yi Feng Yong, Tong Chun, Yi Yu, and others jointly supplied, retail investors all sold, causing a decline to 3.2 candareens. Fu An and others still accepted and rebounded, hovering. The closing price was 1013.4 taels, and articles were auctioned at 3.5 candareens.

<h3 id="e233">Foreign Exchange Market Slightly Looser <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign dispatches, there were no changes in London big bars and American silver. Prices of forward silver showed mixed signals of rise and fall. British exchange against American exchange contracted by 0.25, British exchange against French exchange fell by 6 pounds. American exchange against British exchange decreased by 0.25, and American exchange against French exchange increased by 0.5. London gold was unchanged. Private dispatches indicated that silver prices were unchanged and flat, exchange rates contracted by 0.25, and sterling was also flat. Foreign dispatches stated that President Roosevelt had signed the silver bill, causing sentiment to weaken slightly. The morning foreign exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling, 3 pence, 6875, and U.S. exchange at 33 taels, showing some looseness compared to the previous close. After the opening, banks were slightly bid, but because HSBC's listed prices for British and American exchange remained flat, the process was mediocre. After entering the market, banks slightly bid for forward contracts, and the trend tightened slightly. Although the overnight silver market in Seattle contracted by 0.375, sentiment was confused when Reuters transmitted the details of the President's signing of the silver bill. Although the overnight silver market in Seattle rose by 0.375 in the afternoon, outside the U.S., there were reports of the President postponing the signing, and banks slightly bid, tightening the process slightly. The closing near-term selling prices were British exchange at 1 shilling, 3 pence, 6875, and U.S. exchange at 33.03125 taels, with British exchange loosening by 0.0625 and U.S. exchange also slightly looser compared to the previous close.

<h3 id="e234">Decaying Atmosphere Spreads Throughout Shanghai; No New Developments in the Silver and Banking Industries <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the entire Shanghai market has felt the economic decline, with various industries in dire straits, leading to a decaying atmosphere spreading throughout the city. This has resulted in the financial sector having no loans to extend, and even when loans are extended, they cannot be fully expanded and developed. Furthermore, there is a pervasive sense of risk and deception, and with the value of goods depressed, extending loans is naturally difficult. Therefore, all transactions with various industries are consistently approached with caution, with no opportunities for expansion. If this continues, and with the approaching summer slack season, a more frigid state is feared. Yesterday's interbank lending rate was slightly better than the previous day, at 7 points, consistent between morning and afternoon. However, transactions in drafts were inferior to the previous few days. Morning market transfers were only over 3.5 million, with new transactions over 300,000. Afternoon market transactions were over 400,000. Transactions at the Small General Association were over 300,000. The market rate for "yang hua tou" (foreign coin head) plus water (premium) was still no more than 0.02 or 0.03 points, and the transaction situation remained sluggish. Transactions in foreign pawn loans totaled 780,000, but the actual amount made was even less. Furthermore, banknotes brought back from Jiangbei and Hankou totaled 340,000 in exchange for silver certificates, mostly Chinese banknotes. There was no information on outward remittances. Bank clearings: Foreign banks cleared 2.78 million in draft funds, 4.34 million in various goods and foreign exchange collateral, and 2.56 million in semi-annual settlements, with 400,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks cleared over 2.8 million in draft funds, 5.2 million in various goods and foreign exchange collateral, and over 3 million in settlements, with 200,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Japanese banks cleared over 2.1 million in draft funds, 3.78 million in various goods and foreign exchange collateral, and over 1.5 million in settlements, with 200,000 in warehouse deposits. Native banks cleared over 35.5 million in foreign public receipts, 5.4 million in "yang hua tou" funds, and over 400,000 in remittances from various routes, with over 500,000 received in cash. Furthermore, the total amount exchanged at the Shanghai Clearing House on the 19th was 7,678,839.76 silver dollars, including 3,669,904.76 silver dollars in silver coins and 4,008,935 silver dollars in foreign exchange transfers.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Jiang Jiao Gradually Rebounds <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Although the market for subsidiary coins has not had a special impact on the overall market in recent days, the magnitude of its fluctuations cannot be said to be insignificant. However, because this market is purely operated by small native banks and is not part of the overall financial system, major changes often receive little attention. Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver coins saw another rise. The morning market was at 814.5 yuan, continuing to rise by 2 yuan compared to the afternoon market on the previous day. The afternoon market rose another 0.5 yuan to 815 yuan. Transactions were 7,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were slightly downstream. The morning market was at 731 yuan, and the afternoon market was also better by 0.5 yuan at 731.5 yuan. Transactions were 70,000 jiao in the morning market and 55,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins contracted by 500 cash, to 330,000 cash, with transactions of 41,580, equivalent to a price of 12,600 foreign dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Securities and Bond Market Chaotic, with Mixed Rises and Falls; "Zheng Liu" (Government Bonds Series Six) Exhibits a Relatively Favorable Trend <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market was slightly chaotic, but sentiment remained extremely strong. A portion of the long positions sold. Various groups were particularly interested in Zheng Liu, and the trend seemed to be somewhat sluggish. However, based on observations of the environment, silver supply, and other factors, a steep decline is not currently possible. The financial sector still has favorable trading conditions, and the opening of traffic has no problems. The Tanggu Agreement may even be abolished. Even if there are setbacks in the future, they will not be significant. As soon as there is a slight decline, there will be many buyers. Yesterday's activity included significant buying of issues 4, 9, and 38 in the morning session, and market prices continued to rise. Zheng Liu rose the most, by 4.5 candareens. In the second session, some long positions sold off, and issues 32 and 50 saw significant selling, but market prices only retreated by about 1 or 2 candareens. The afternoon situation was more chaotic, with mixed rises and falls in both the opening and closing sessions, with fluctuations of only 1 to 3 candareens. Overall, Zheng Liu performed the best, and disarmament also showed signs of a rebound. The difference in market price between the short-term gold bond and the disarmament bond was only over 2 yuan. In reality, the total amount of disarmament bonds remaining is only 30 million, while the short-term gold bond still has 76.77 million remaining. The momentum of the short-term gold bond rise has been unmatched by the disarmament bond, so the disarmament bond still has potential for a rebound. As a result, market prices saw mixed rises and falls. The short-term gold bond was slightly weak, while the disarmament bond and Zheng Liu performed better. The total number of transactions was 21.75 million, or 2,000 yuan. The details of the price fluctuations are listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>The yarn market, after initially showing signs of fatigue, has once again become tense with rising prices. This is due to high prices for Japanese yarn. Speculators in the market generally believe that the Sino-Japanese dispute is likely to be resolved peacefully, and the issues of postal and transportation services are expected to be settled by July 1st. As a result, those betting on rising prices have become very active. Furthermore, merchants from Tianjin have been consistently purchasing Chinese yarn, leading to a shift in sentiment. The market is cautiously optimistic about future changes, adjusting sales based on actual demand.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Bullish Activity</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn pre-market, American cotton prices fell in terms of pounds. However, the previous day's bullish momentum led to a slight shortage of buyers in the market, with prices for each month (May, June, and July) falling by five, six, and seven tenths of a tael. Around noon, the cotton market rallied, driving yarn prices up by several tenths of a tael. Near the closing bell, it was reported that Japanese Three Grades Yarn for the current month experienced a massive short squeeze, soaring by eleven yuan. Concurrently, Tianjin merchants were still trading in domestic yarn, causing the market to suddenly jump by five or six tenths of a tael. Ultimately, prices for near months fell by one or two tenths of a tael, while prices for distant months rose by one, two, or three tenths of a tael. At the afternoon opening, due to the surge in Three Grades Yarn, short covering was vigorous, with prices for each month rising by one yuan or more. A survey taken near the final closing bell indicated that while actual yarn sales were good, the volume was not as high as the previous day, and market prices retreated by several tenths of a tael. In the end, prices rose by six, seven, eight, nine tenths of a tael, up to one yuan and one tenth of a tael. Total trading volume for the day was 46,550 bales. Sell orders came from: Shenchang (800 bales), Gengfeng (750 bales), Da Kee (700 bales), Da Feng (800 bales), Tong Kee (1,100 bales), Ren Feng (850 bales), Hengchang (1,900 bales), De Kee (700 bales), Heng De (1,100 bales), and Yi Chang (600 bales). Buy orders came from: Xin Cheng (600 bales), Yong Da (600 bales), Hui Kang (900 bales), Jun Chang (700 bales), Da Feng (1,750 bales), Ming De (2,000 bales), Shen Kee (2,150 bales), Tai Chang (2,200 bales), Xie Sheng (1,350 bales), and Da Chang (1,000 bales). The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Total 204,050</p>
<p>Active Spot Purchases in North China</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain good, but less so than the previous day. Total purchases by various merchants for the day amounted to 1,091 bales. Market conditions were similar to the previous day. Purchase amounts by different merchants were as follows:</p>
<p>Qingdao 30, Sichuan 100, Tianjin 540, Ningbo 6</p>
<p>Shantou 35, Inland 230, Guangdong 150</p>

<p>The cotton market followed the yarn market and remained firm, with considerable momentum. However, foreign cotton was flat and sluggish, and rumors circulated in the market about the reorganization of bullish firms. As a result, scattered short positions were reluctantly covered. In the afternoon, some bullish traders took profits, causing the market to show signs of weakening.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Small Cute) At the opening of the cotton market, foreign cotton was weak, but rumors circulated that a certain bank was increasing its bullish positions, causing the market to become more firm. Prices for each month rose by one or two tenths of a tael. Near the closing bell, news of rising prices for Three Grades Yarn led to a surge in buying, with distant months becoming even firmer. In the end, near months rose by two or three tenths of a tael, while distant months rose by four tenths of a tael. At the afternoon opening, momentum was strong, but unexpectedly, a certain bullish trader heavily sold July and August futures, causing prices to retreat by one or two tenths of a tael near the final closing bell.

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months showed a consistent decline. Imported wheat was quoted at Chicago at slightly higher prices (one or two corners) and Canada (two or three corners). However, market sentiment was influenced by the heavy rain the previous night, with continued rainfall the following day. With rice seedlings being transplanted everywhere, this welcome rain not only pleased farmers but also eased the minds of those involved in the grain trade. As a result, prices declined after the opening, with near months falling by nearly one tenth of a tael and distant months by two tenths of a tael. By the afternoon closing, prices for the current month had fallen by nearly one tenth of a tael again. Distant months, however, were supported by buying from the banking sector, causing the market to recover slightly. Under the current circumstances, actual sales are still being observed, while speculative activity continues unabated. Only a surge in physical goods will break this trend. Ultimately, the current month fell by 0.05 tael, July and August fell by 0.125 tael, September fell by 0.1 tael, October fell by 0.15 tael, and November fell by 0.1 tael.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months generally showed a flat and sluggish trend. Imported wheat prices were slightly higher (one, two, or three corners). However, the rain had eased the minds of traders in both local and foreign markets, weakening market sentiment after the opening. Although new wheat is being harvested, farmers are busy with autumn farming, and supplies have not been flowing smoothly. As a result, both sellers and buyers have been hesitant. However, it is predicted that supplies will improve in about two weeks, and market fluctuations should be observed at that time. Ultimately, July fell by 0.02 tael, August fell by 0.01 tael, and September fell by 0.03 tael. The spot wheat market is stable. While shipments are arriving continuously, this year's wheat is mostly dry, and both buyers and sellers are unwilling to accept discounts. Therefore, prices are being maintained. Lin Huai, Mingguang, and Bengbu wheat are priced at 1.9 taels. Wuhu, Gaoyou, Hezhou, and Liuhe wheat are priced at 2.8 taels. Kunshan wheat is priced at 2.7 taels, up to 2.65 taels. Zhitang wheat is priced at 1.75 taels. Fuxin purchased 1,700 packages, Xinda purchased 1,000 packages, Shenda purchased 1,000 packages, and Huafeng purchased 1,000 packages.</p>

<p>(Hu Nan) Arrivals are extremely scarce, with only about a dozen firms (a total of 1,400 shi), making the situation quite tight. Retail sales are slow in the market, and sellers are demanding high prices, leading to continued sluggish market conditions. However, wholesale buyers are discouraged by reports of falling prices in Tianjin, so they are only purchasing about 1,000 packages, keeping the market flat. The prices of glutinous rice have risen by over a foot in various stores throughout the city, and indica rice has also seen increases of several tenths of a tael. Bagged rice remains unaffected. Du Yang’s superior quality rice continues to be sought after due to its superior quality, while older rice has been slightly cheaper, but has also seen prices increase by a few tenths of a tael.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, the supply of He Xia rice was only six or seven firms. While retail sales were not good, wholesalers remained firm. As a result, the price of white glutinous rice increased by an angle, early season indica increased as well, Du yang's superior quality rice increased as well, other rice types were stable.</p>

<p>Green cocoon production is not weak. This year's Jiaxing spring silkworm eggs are not weak, resulting in a relatively abundant cocoon harvest. Traditional varieties account for 60%, while improved varieties account for 40%. The total production of fresh cocoons in the county is over 60,000 dan, accounting for one-third of the province's total production.</p>
<p>There are over hundreds of cocoon firms. Firms have collected of the improve variety cocoons, hundred fifty-seven dan and fifty-five jin. The local cocoon varieties are forty thousand hundreds forty-eight dan and seven hundred six jin. There are more than ten thousand dan that villagers use to spin soil silk. Within the cocoon there are over nine hundreds dan of mixed color cocoons.</p>
<p>Suzhou Cocoons are Continuously Transported Suzhou Spring Cocoons have come to an end. The silk cocoon merchants in the port bake fresh cocoons into dried cocoons for shipping to Shanghai. In recent days, the new cocoons from Yixing, Liyang, Changshu, Wuxi, and Chengjiang counties have been transported with over forty thousands packages where Suzhou transport covers three ten thousands packages. Shanghai Ningbo trains only loaded over a ten thousands packages.</p>
<p>Silk Sales Remain Difficult to Turn Around The European and American markets are importing silk. The current prices are stagnant. There are thick inventories but imports remain. The current price of silk is dropping. The Shanghai port sent telegrams that the price is too high and it does not convert. Although the Europeans are stocking up, the price is very low, Chinese businessmen can not sell. Silk sales remain lacking a turning point. Yesterday Dachan and other companies sent hundreds of yellow and white silk to Shanghai. The price remained the same.</p>

<p>Zhejiang’s Shaoxing Pingshui green tea has seen improvement of its sales recently. Colorless people from the local area and continue to continue the board game. The city has a total of three Gangs, including Jiatian Zhenheng, where the highest price is fifty yuan, zero and a corner, and the lowest price is forty-eight yuan and seven corners. The average price is six to seven yuan lower than last year. Other Zhenmei pearl teas and various small colors have also improved. In addition, Luzhuang Zhenmei needle teas are trading lively. Jiangxi Province's Yushan Zhenmei has been opened for bidding by Zhenhe Tea Company at a price of eighty yuan, and the selling price is also quite firm. For black teas such as Qining, both the British and Russian companies have strong purchasing power, and the market trend is stable. However, a large amount of Hubei black tea has recently been shipped from Hankou to Shanghai, making it difficult to stabilize the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Spider <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Da Nian</p>
<p>Bats are common in China and are widely liked by the public. They are a symbol of "good fortune," probably because of the similar sound. Occasionally, at dusk, a bat flies into the birdcage, "stopping at the corner of the seat, looking very leisurely." "Unable to speak, please respond with speculation," it is actually a philosophical bat. Is it a bird or a beast? Birds and beasts cannot be in the same group, so let it fly away, whether it is a bird or a beast. But occasionally, in a cool place, a large web is spread, waiting for flying insects. That is the spider.</p>
<p>For a moment, I forgot whether "ju xiao in the house" refers to this creature. In any case, this creature is disgusting because it weaves nets to kill flying insects and also hinders humans. Children often like to hold bamboo branches to break it and drive it away.</p>
<p>In the past, someone discussed the five virtues of chickens, and later a teacher added two more virtues: one is the ability to kill, and the other is the ability to eat. But spiders also have several virtues. Full of knowledge and skill in crafting nets: wisdom. Standing against the wind, unafraid of wind and dust: courage. Being the same color as its surroundings, leaving no trace: harmony. Using stillness to control movement, sitting upright in the center: the Way. Accepting fate and waiting for the right time, being a disciple of Heaven: nourishment. Fleeing into the void with the slightest reliance: concession. Leaving gaps between the lines: benevolence.</p>
<p>Thinking carefully about human affairs, they are no different from this. There are railway networks on the ground, and power grids during wartime. Even everyone has a kind of atmosphere around them, spreading a kind of weaving. Whether it is for fame or for profit, it must make people see through it, and this is the goodness of ethics. In this way, they obtain food and avoid starving. Those with great abilities spread large webs, obtain great peace, and become large spiders; those with little strength only spread small threads and obtain small snacks. Education, etc., is just teaching people how to do it cleverly. Of course, laziness is not allowed, and that is why people are taught to be diligent. One cannot be too exposed, touching the eyes, and that is why people are taught to be humble, self-deprecating, and cultivated.</p>
<p>All worldly affairs are generally like this. This is not sarcasm. Humans are, after all, a kind of animal in nature, with the virtues of nature. The ancients called nature "Heaven," and one should "observe the Way of Heaven and practice the actions of Heaven." But Zhuangzi is unreachable. He tells people to "enter and play in its fence without harming its name," which means turning into a moth and flying through the gaps without touching the threads. However, there is still no philosophy that destroys this network.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Horizontal Mastery <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>The word "mastery" is probably used in the Confucian world, with "master of all things" being a compliment and "not mastering all things" being a pejorative. Not mastering is just a single-minded person. Therefore, what scholars devote themselves to is mastering. The meaning of "master of all things" is very vague. Generally, people intentionally or unintentionally tacitly acknowledge Wang Chong's interpretation in "Lunheng": "Those who are well-read in ancient and modern times are masters of all things." In fact, this definition is not complete. Zhang Xuecheng, in his "General Meaning of Literary History," Volume 4, "Horizontal Mastery," said: "The name 'master of all things' cannot be generalized. There is specialization, and there is broad knowledge. Each has its own irreplaceable quality. Each has its own lack of communication, but if there's communication then there will not be benefits. The name 'mastery' is likened to roads that extend in all directions and reach everywhere. It also refers to the knowledge in one's heart. Though there are differences in high, low, partial, complete, large, small, broad, and narrow, all can reach the Great Way, so it is called 'mastery.'" This saying is quite precise. Wang Chong's words only point out one side of mastery, which is incomplete. However, there are many cases of those who appear to be masters of all things but are not actually. Therefore, Zhang specially established the term "horizontal mastery" in addition to "mastery" to include this type of situation. What is horizontal mastery? He continued from the above: "There are also those that cannot extend in all directions and cannot reach the Great Way, but must also be called 'mastery.' This is called 'horizontal mastery.' Horizontal mastery and 'master of all things' are the same and different, close and far, united and separated." This distinction is especially insightful. There are truly countless people in the world who regard horizontal mastery as "mastery of all things" and those who regard themselves as masters of all things through horizontal mastery. Taking Zhang himself as an example, his masterpiece "General Meaning of Literary History" includes the statement "All Six Classics are History." In the "Yi Jiao" chapter, regarding the interpretation of "Zhou Yi" as history, Hu Shi said that it "very much reveals traces of forced connection" (see "Chronicle of Mr. Zhang Shizhai's Life"). However, merely interpreting something as not being perfectly good does not detract from the value of his statement "All Six Classics are History." The so-called "forced connection," in Zhang's own words, falls into the trap of horizontal mastery. Zhang devoted his life to mastery, but even so, there were still places where he could not completely avoid horizontal mastery, which shows that mastery is not easy.</p>
<p>In the past, when people read books, they often spoke of "suddenly becoming thoroughly enlightened." Later generations, upon seeing these words, often thought of this as a miracle. This is because the reader only sees and pays attention to the words "suddenly," but actually does not see and does not pay attention to the words "suddenly." Suddenly becoming thoroughly enlightened is not a miracle. One must know that before this "suddenly," one has already used up a great deal of energy to have this "suddenly" of thorough enlightenment. This is the same principle as the coexistence of gradual change and sudden change. However, today's people seek mastery suddenly. Many books on academic subjects often end with the eye-catching phrase "Master in 100 Days," such as "XX Master in 100 Days." At first glance, it seems to require more effort than "suddenly"; however, the book is only a thin volume, and the time is only 100 days, so it can be calculated that mastery will be achieved. This is indeed a miracle. Although it is said that scientific methods can save human energy, they do not teach people not to learn. Moreover, whether the content of the so-called "Master in 100 Days" leads to mastery or not is still a major question! The term itself is already illogical, and using this term is even more of a distortion. As the saying goes, "Without learning, there is no skill," but now it is "Skill without learning," using skill to drive people into the path of not learning. Here, we do not say "having skill without learning," but "skill without learning" to show that this skill is also very suspicious.</p>
<p>Since recent times, due to the complexity of international relations, there have also been so-called "XX Masters" appearing in droves. This is originally a good phenomenon. But it may not be possible to generalize. Zhang said in the "Horizontal Mastery" chapter that those booksellers, book collectors, and book engravers have said, "These people are nothing more than lute players and tablet craftsmen, whose professions are connected to literature. Since they have contacted many celebrities, they are accustomed to hearing pure words and famous theories. But with no wisdom in their hearts, they hear and tell, and the shallowness of their foundations is not difficult to see." Are not a few words of "Pidgin English" from a foreign language suddenly pleasant to the ear?</p>
<p>In today's atmosphere of floating, shallowness, and shallowness in learning, horizontal mastery is prevalent.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Drum Music – One of the Boat Cabin Sketches – <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>I had already decided that I would not go ashore tonight to see the lanterns. I planned to stay in the boat cabin, tidying up the day's drawings under the candlelight at my small table, or lying down to read the newly arrived magazines. When I felt hungry in the evening, I would borrow a bowl from the boat owner's wife and go ashore to buy a bowl of "lifesaving dumplings" to eat. That would be more enjoyable than throwing myself into the whirlpool of the crowd to see the lanterns. But in the end, I changed my mind and went ashore with the boat owner to see the lanterns.</p>
<p>The reason for my change of heart was partly due to the boat owner's encouragement, and partly due to the temptation of the drum music. The boat owner said that tonight's lanterns would be much better than last night's, with decorated platforms borrowed from other docks and a "Jinhua Old Dragon" with over seventy segments. Many people had specially hired boats from afar to see it, so since we happened to be here, we might as well enjoy the spectacle. Hearing about this grand occasion, I felt I should join in the fun. At the same time, the sound of drums and music floated into my boat cabin from all directions, making my feet itch. Involuntarily, I packed up my drawing tools and books and jumped ashore with the boat owner to "share the joy with everyone."</p>
<p>The instruments used in the drum music are all percussion instruments that cannot play melodies. The music played is only a simple repetition of a few tunes, just like the songs children sing: "Dong dong shang, deng deng shang, deng deng ci deng ci deng shang..." But it has a magical appeal that can attract people from far and near. Recalling the sounds of silk strings, bamboo pipes, and wind instruments I heard at the lantern festival last night, although they seemed complex on the surface, in my opinion (actually, listening, but one might as well say seeing) they were simpler than the drum music. Based on my memory, the melodies of the silk strings, bamboo pipes, and wind instruments I heard last night, if recorded in simplified notation, would be nothing more than</p>
<p>51615丨516156丨6161152丨323232</p>
<p>3312丨1611653丨5┆┆</p>
<p>embellishments. Listening to it for too long made my heart itch, which was very unbearable. Moreover, this itch could not be scratched; even if I immediately covered my ears and walked away, I would still carry this itch with me. Drum music is different. When you hear it from afar, your feet itch; as long as you run with the crowd, you will feel refreshed. When you run closer, your body and mind will assimilate into the rhythm of the drum music, and you will become excited with it. Listening to it for too long will at most make you tired, but it will never make you feel unbearable. This is a unique product of Chinese music. As far as I know, Western music does not seem to have any performance method composed entirely of percussion instruments.</p>
<p>Therefore, I went ashore with the boat owner, ostensibly to see the lanterns, but in reality, I wanted to see the performance of the drum music. We stood by the bridge to watch the lanterns. Many lanterns, like sedan chairs, were carried across the bridge. Later, due to obstacles ahead, they all stopped. Standing in front of me was a splendid decorated platform bearing large plaques with the words "Promote Life" and "Share Joy with the People." Behind it was a band of percussionists. I squeezed through the crowd to the back to watch the percussionists' performance closely. The playing method was very straightforward, but the alternating strikes of gongs, drums, cymbals, and other instruments created a kind of graceful and majestic rhythm. The playing of the drums was particularly straightforward, always beating "Dong, dong, dong, dong" without ever changing the rhythm. But because of the cooperation of other instruments, it could express a special effect. The appearance of the drum beater was even more surprising to me: a child was carrying a drum on his back and running forward, while the drummer followed behind, beating the drum all the way, as if chasing a defeated general. The faster the child ran, the tighter the drumming behind him chased. When the child stopped to let him beat, he would take a stance and beat him hard. The child endured the beating on his back while eating a sesame cake in front. The sesame seeds on the cake fell off one after another with the "Dong, dong, dong, dong" of the drum. He reached out and caught the sesame seeds, slowly licking them with his tongue. I went closer to look and saw that his whole body, muscles, and even his hair, were trembling with the beating of the drum. His internal organs must have been vibrating with the sound of the drum. This was an all-encompassing full-body exercise. The sesame cake was probably digested quickly. But looking closely at the child's age, he was only about ten years old. His skin and flesh were very tender, and his bones must not be very strong. Such intense drumming until midnight, his tender bones could be knocked apart, and he would have to go home and have his mother reassemble them.</p>
<p>I quickly took out my sketchbook to capture this amazing scene. After drawing it, the drum band set off and gradually moved away. After putting away my sketchbook and listening to the drum music again, the rhythm was not as graceful and majestic as before, and seemed to carry a hint of sadness. (May 20, 1934)</p>

<p>— Hua Zi</p>
<p>"Mr. Xu, my Xiaoyu is smart. He knows I hate the revolutionaries the most, so he hid it from me, hid it from me. At one time, I only saw him very busy, with many people coming and going, sometimes not even returning home all night. At that time, he was teaching at a school during the day, and he still brought his monthly salary home without missing a penny, not like he was gambling or whoring outside, so I didn't bother him. Only my old woman would often scold him, but he didn't say a word. He was very filial. After a few months, one day, Xiaoyu came home and said to me very happily: 'Dad, the National Revolutionary Army has reached Shanghai, and the county party headquarters has been openly established. I have been elected as a formal executive committee member.' I only heard the two words 'revolution,' and I asked, 'What about the revolutionaries? Have they been defeated by the true emperor? What about you?' Later, Xiaoyu explained to me in detail, and I understood what was going on. I knew that the revolutionaries of the past were overthrowing the emperor, and the revolutionaries of today were helping the poor. Now, these revolutionaries who help the poor have won the world, and my Xiaoyu has become the leader of the revolution.</p>
<p>At first, I couldn't help but have some doubts and worries, but that night, I was so happy that I couldn't stand it. That night, many of Xiaoyu's friends came to my house. My house was so small and narrow, like a pigsty, but those friends didn't care. Many people crowded around and discussed things with Xiaoyu. I heard them say that the county magistrate had run away, and now they were discussing who should be the new magistrate. Some people advocated for the scholar Ke, and some advocated for Mr. Zhuang Si, but my Xiaoyu said that they were all old gentry and not revolutionaries. He advocated for Chen Shiyi, the principal of the county high school, to be the new magistrate, and everyone agreed. I admired my Xiaoyu so much. He could actually appoint a magistrate, so wouldn't he be even bigger than the magistrate?</p>

<h3 id="e253">A Word for the City's Hygiene Movement <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Zi</p>
<p>Hygiene movement is very necessary in our country today. Chinese people are indeed too unhygienic. Foreigners criticize us Chinese in this way, and we ourselves often blame ourselves in this way. However, why are Chinese people so unhygienic? This is another big problem. Chinese people have not always been so unhygienic. It is just that the current China is unable to pay attention to hygiene. How do I mean this? Well, let's see: how many Chinese people can live their extremely ordinary lives safely? Even a meal of rice and porridge is a problem. I ask, in this situation, who has the time and money to pay attention to hygiene? Of course, paying attention to hygiene does not necessarily require much effort or a lot of money. However, in reality, paying attention to hygiene does require considerable effort and money. For example, getting a haircut and taking a bath are very simple hygiene practices. For people with relatively affluent lives, it is not a problem. However, for the vast majority of poor people, it becomes a problem. Getting a haircut costs money, and taking a bath costs money. Although the money is not much, it is still needed. They usually have trouble eating a meal, so they save where they can. Therefore, they can only extend the time between haircuts and baths. This is why they cannot pay attention to this aspect of hygiene. This is still a small problem. There are many other aspects of hygiene that they cannot practice, especially the cleanliness of their homes, daily lives, and diets. They cannot even talk about that. As for getting sick, the problem is even more difficult. They simply have to wait to die, because apart from the quack doctors and wandering practitioners who can be hired for a few hundred coins, ordinary doctors are generally beyond their reach. I ask, in this situation, even if you want them to pay attention to hygiene, how can it be possible? Of course, it is not possible.</p>
<p>The city's Health Bureau has now decided to start a city-wide hygiene movement starting on the 19th of this month. This is certainly a very meaningful and commendable event. We hope that everyone can implement it. However, we further hope that they will take further steps, such as cleaning the streets and removing pits and toilets. This is still preliminary work. The most important thing is how to make everyone pay attention to hygiene and have a proper hygienic environment. This is a fundamental social problem, and a simple hygiene movement cannot be effective. However, we still hope that the health authorities can pay close attention to this. The filth and uncleanness of the working-class areas is a commonly recognized fact. How can we make them clean? Of course, this cannot be achieved by sweeping the streets once or spraying disinfectant once. We must first teach them how to maintain hygiene afterwards. This is the fundamental work. In short, we hope that the authorities can think more about the general poor people. Because the poor people are the most unhygienic. Rich people do not need anyone to tell them about hygiene. They already live very hygienic lives. If we ignore the poor people, the hygiene movement will be fruitless. The health authorities should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Marriage <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>Humans, whether male or female, when they reach a certain age, instinctively activate their youthful functions. At that time, it is the initial period of needing sexual comfort. Due to the beginning of sexual needs, they eagerly hope to get married.</p>
<p>Sexual frustration is a common disease among young people. Because of sexual distress, their spirits decline, and they feel that real life is boring and monotonous. In order to adjust the meaning of life, they have to find a life partner. Marriage is the best and most practical way to solve all these problems. Every young person thinks this way. Once they reach puberty, they will uncontrollably yearn for marriage and to form a small family. Indeed, the ideal married life is so beautiful!</p>
<p>How pleasant! Especially when the happy small family life begins, the entire life is filled with vitality and joy.</p>
<p>The small family is a palace of happiness, a gentle land of fairies, and even a sweet paradise. The surrounding environment seems to be in a rose-colored dream, and the masters living here, of course, seem to be drunk on wine.</p>
<p>However, sweet as it may be, drunk as it may be, the heavy pressure of life increases relentlessly on your shoulders, and the instruments of worry lock you in for life!</p>
<p>Marriage is the tomb of love. The process of people in love is wonderful and bright. However, when love reaches a certain level, they hope to get married sooner and start living together sooner. But after living together, it disappoints you, and you feel that the past was empty, with only that blurry memory lingering on the cerebral membrane.</p>
<p>Life is not completely without happiness, but you have to find happiness yourself. Humanity is not completely without pain, but you have to overcome and resolve the pain yourself. However, the so-called pain and the so-called happiness can only be experienced by the person involved. To a third party, it cannot be definitely asserted. Because everyone's perceptions are different, and because of the differences in perception, the resulting effects are also different. For example, in the eyes of others, you are very happy, but in reality, you feel immense pain! You think that your life is extremely painful, but conversely, I have no feeling, as if it is very happy. In short, these are completely different expressions of each person's feelings and interests. Isn't marriage the same?</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Ma and Ms. Xu were united through a beautiful process of love. Recently, I went to visit them and took the opportunity to inquire about Mr. Ma's life after marriage. He only shook his head at me. At the same time, I went to ask Ms. Xu, and she smiled without answering. Here, they gave me a very clear hint that life after marriage is just like this! But I think, in another three or four years, it may be even more tasteless. There will be a large group of children, the family's finances will also expand accordingly, and life will become unstable. Someone once said that a person who gets married is like being sentenced to life imprisonment. Only today have I proven that this statement is indeed not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>However, all in all, marriage can be said to be the happiest moment in a person's life, but it is also the time when the seeds of the most pain begin to sprout. The flowers that bloom in the future will naturally be filled with worries, and the final fruits will also be bittersweet.</p>
<p>I believe that people who have tried married life will definitely express sympathy for this situation.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Starting with High-Heeled Leather Shoes <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Rong</p>
<p>By chance, I read a few words of a French scholar quoted in Plekhanov's book, which made me think of women's high-heeled leather shoes and the extravagant decorations of modern times, and gave rise to many feelings. Those words were like this:</p>
<p>"In Seine-et-Marne, wealthy Negro women wear shoes that are so narrow that they cannot be fully put on. Therefore, these women appear special because of their very restrained walking. However, this way of walking is considered extremely seductive."</p>
<p>Because it is considered extremely seductive, they do not hesitate to endure the pain of restricted movement and wear those unsuitable and uncomfortable shoes. This is not only a "special landscape" of the Negro race. Similarly, there is the three-inch golden lotus of ancient China in the distance, and the high-heeled leather shoes that swept the world in recent times.</p>
<p>To mutilate any part of the body and create a deformed state is to be considered the most absurd thing. Many medical scientists have already proven that high heels are harmful. However, the scientists' impartial arguments cannot match the blind worship of the masses. Thus, in the situation of "the city loves height, and all around increase it by a foot," high-heeled leather shoes were led by a few fashionable cities and became the main trend of women's decoration in an era.</p>
<p>In fact, in our view, this phenomenon is somewhat ridiculous. Instead of using a person's feet to walk straight and balanced, they deliberately stand on tiptoes, creating a crooked and unstable posture to win people's praise. This is simply a bit foolish. However, the defenders repeatedly say: "This increases the graceful figure and the slender waist!" Because in the eyes of these people, only high-heeled leather shoes can increase people's beauty. But is beauty truly</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>an absolute standard? As far as I know, aesthetic concepts often change with social psychology, and the basis of social psychology is the entire social foundation and its era. Beauty changes with changes in time and space. The three-inch golden lotus of ancient times has been abandoned by modern people, and the ear-piercing and colorful decorations of Africa can only prevail in their kind of society and region. Now is the era of capitalist decadence. In the cities of this era, people's psychology tends to be sexually indulgent. They demand that women wear high heels, wear expensive ornaments, apply rouge, and wear yellow powder. Their aesthetic standards are gracefulness, slenderness, delicacy, gentleness, and vividness, and further, they want sensuality! The main purpose of these is to suit their own requirements and enjoyment. Therefore, in this kind of society, high-heeled shoes and various luxury goods are "considered extremely seductive" and sweep the era.</p>
<p>In a male-centered society, the degree of oppression of women can be said to reach the extreme. They cannot have their own standards of beauty. Their standards of beauty must be determined by the needs of the surrounding men. They are regarded as decorations or even playthings and exist in this world. Not to mention women under the control of feudal forces, even women with more progressive thoughts often cannot break through this difficult barrier. Is there anything more unfair than this? However, this "unfairness" has become commonplace, from stimulation to indifference, from indifference to forgetting.</p>
<p>New women must awaken. They should know that this is not only a deception, but simply an insult. They will not pretend and lose their own nature because people "consider it extremely seductive." The first step from awakening to reform is to break the shackles from their limbs and remove high-heeled shoes and many unnecessary decorations from their bodies!</p>

<p>— San Duo</p>
<p>When I was a child, when I read the Legend of the White Snake, I was just like being poisoned by the strange chivalrous legends, I really wanted to go to Leifeng Pagoda to see the real snake appearance of White Maiden and Little Qingqing. Speaking of it, it is really a pity, it is said that when Leifeng Pagoda collapsed, there was a white light flying into the sky, this is naturally the White Maiden showing her holiness, but the people who saw it did not know the whereabouts of this "going". Moreover, there is no Xu Xian officer reborn as a seven-life boy, of course, the White Maiden has no need to repay her kindness and does not know where to go. After many years, the snake and others probably had their mortal hearts moved again, and they actually rode the clouds to the sea. This Dragon Boat Festival in the 23rd year of the Republic of China is even more spectacular. In addition to the dragon boat races in Bansong Garden, the two divine snakes Bai Qing showed their power at noon. Unfortunately, the snakes were still snakes, and they did not transform into the charming and beautiful White Maiden and Little Qingqing. Otherwise, there would definitely be Xu Xian officers who claimed to be the world's seven-life boys and re-enact a story of righteous demons. But it is enough to look at that paragraph of text to get a taste of it. I think there is no shortage of comrades who are obsessed with the Legend of the White Snake, and I dare not keep it secret, so I introduce it to the left;</p>
<p>Yesterday was the abolished calendar Dragon Boat Festival, the two divine snakes Bai Qing enshrined by this association, when they were showing their power at noon, caused the cage shed to be shattered, and tourists were frightened and fled far away, causing great chaos. We have already added spiritual amulets to suppress and stop it, so that there is no danger. However, we deeply apologize to the tourists who were frightened yesterday, and express our gratitude.

<h3 id="e257">Talking About the Role of Trademarks and Signboards <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Tang</p>
<p>In the past, stores always had a signboard, while modern new-style stores, companies, or factories all have trademarks. Trademarks and signboards are all business logos that indicate the identity of a store or company, and imply a certain business or product identity. For example, the trademark of the Family Industrial Cooperative's products is a butterfly made up of the five characters "Family Industrial Cooperative," and the trademark of Chen Jiageng Company's products is a Chinese character "中" with a circle added around it. These trademarks are all product logos that indicate the identity of the factory, and are convenient for buyers to identify.</p>
<p>Trademarks play a very important role. In foreign countries, a trademark can often be valued at tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Because the value of this trademark represents the entire product value of the company or factory. Without commodities as a foundation, trademarks cannot occupy an important position in society; at the same time, without trademarks as identification, commodities cannot stand out and be recognized by everyone at first glance. This shows the value of trademarks.</p>
<p>In the past, my country did not have trademarks, but only signboards. Also, because these signboards were mostly not registered, and there were no registration methods at that time, the imitation of signboards was particularly popular in my country. For example, the Daoxiang Village in Suzhou and the Lugao Jian in Shanghai are almost everywhere, which is one example.</p>
<p>Signboards and trademarks are not only prevalent in commerce, but also in other areas. Especially in the literary world, they have become particularly popular in recent years. Someone has written a strange book or done something strange. At this time, such strange books and strange things can also be used as a trademark or signboard. For example, first there is a collection of love letters, then two more collections come. Then the advertisements boast greatly, saying that the first collection has subverted some of humanity, and of course, the second collection is also very good without saying too much. Everyone, go buy it. Another example is that I have previously written strange books such as the History of Sexuality and have been noticed. Now I will write other articles again, at this time I can bring out the previous strange books and call people to pay attention to me again. In this way, there are more outlets for my articles. Of course, booksellers also make extra money. This is the role of a trademark and signboard.</p>
<p>Similarly, many people have become accustomed to using signboards in recent years. For example, a judge who retires and becomes a lawyer must say: "So-and-so previously served as a judge of the so-and-so High Court, and a judge of the so-and-so District Court." The more official titles, the better. What is the purpose? The purpose is to use this as a signboard. Another example is that people who sell calligraphy and paintings must also put on some former Qing Dynasty scholar-officials, or even what kind of officials. In this way, the person's identity will appear particularly high and elegant, and his works (commodities) can be sold more easily. In addition, fortune-telling and fortune-telling will probably use this trick. Fortunately, society is blind, they think that as long as the signboard is hung well, there is no need to worry about the commodity having no outlets. Are the commodities really good?</p>
<p>The buyers don't care.</p>
<p>Signboards and trademarks are not only prevalent in commerce, but also in all aspects. Alas, this society where everything has been commodified!</p>
<h3 id="e258">Fishing Festival <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Yan</p>
<p>Dengjia Yaotou, also known as Dengjia Kou, is a region in Shandong Province with a relatively large fish production. It belongs to Zhucheng County. Every year after Grain Rain, it is the beginning of the fishing season. From the beginning of March to May, this period is called the Fishing Festival.</p>
<p>Ten days before the Fishing Festival, fishermen rushed to Dengjia Yaotou to choose a place to build a shed, as a temporary home during the fishing season. About 2,000 sheds are set up every year. At the same time, in addition to the fishermen who specialize in this period, there are also thousands of sheds that specialize in the fishermen's business, such as: food stalls, tea stalls, smoking dens, wine stalls, gambling grounds, theater stalls, rockers, and other small stalls for daily necessities. It can be said that in addition to the larger stores such as the Jingzhuang gold and silver industry that are generally available in the market, it is simply fully equipped. Moreover, in this shed-covered amusement field, there are also divisions into first-class and second-class, which can be said to be the stratification of classes all over the world.</p>
<p>In the past, fishermen could more or less obtain considerable benefits during this period. However, in recent years, due to the increasing bankruptcy of the social economy, the lack of people's purchasing power, the dumping of foreign fish, the harshness of official passes, and the poor fishing gear, which is not enough to compete with foreign fishing boats that invade our territorial waters, these have led to the fishermen increasingly seeing the dead end of their profession. Therefore, the Fishing Festival in this area has not been as lively and prosperous as it used to be in recent years.</p>
<p>"Note:" Dengjia Yaotou is a place name in Zhucheng County, Shandong Province. The area is rich in fish, so the county people mostly call it Dengjia Yao.</p>

<p>— Shen</p>
<p>The "whistle" has already sounded for the second time. The third time means it's time to enter the factory, so I hurriedly put on my washed blue cloth short jacket from yesterday, picked up my lunch basket, and ran outside. The sunlight was already covering the ground. I strode towards the factory. A "special vehicle" sped past, filled with comrades in blue cloth short jackets, also on their way to work. Then came barefoot, sturdy men, carrying shoulder poles laden with fresh vegetables, heading to the market to sell. A police officer directed the traffic at the intersection. Students in long silk gowns or cheongsams, carrying small briefcases, were hurrying to school. Athletes were practicing long-distance races on the road. These were what I saw along the way, so I wondered, why couldn't I find what I saw the other day when Aunt Lin took me to play on "Great Avenue"—the gentlemen with handlebar mustaches sitting in cars with their plump, fair-skinned wives, the young masters in foreign clothes and the young ladies walking hand in hand, and the little Pekingese dogs in their arms? After thinking for a while, I realized that this dawning of the morning is the sole prize for us laborers who live by our own efforts.</p>
<p>I happily continued on my way, feeling especially joyful today because I knew that the lovely dawn is exclusively ours, belonging to our class. Although I don't have a moment of rest all day long, at this moment I think, my spirit is joyful. Although I am constantly drenched in sweat every day, the price of this sweat is the rice in my bowl. I maintain my life with my own labor. What a glorious life!</p>
<p>When I arrived at the factory gate, the whistle sounded for the third time, and in that instant, I was swallowed inside.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Thoughts on the Women's Art Exhibition <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Feng Wenfeng</p>
<p>Our art association recently held its first exhibition at the Ningbo Native Place Association. The exhibition lasted for three days, and we received over ten thousand visitors. We received very good reviews from the outside, such as Tang Guanyu, Li Qiujun, Yu Danhan, Gu Qingyao, Yang Xueyao, Yang Xuejiu, Bao Yahui, Xu Hui, Huang Yingfen, Pang Zuoyu, Yu Jingzhi, Jiang Yanan, Ding Yunbi, who are already well-known and need no further introduction. There are also many others, such as Yao Xinhua, He Yi, Wei Xinyun, Fan Caixia, Zhu Zhixian, Weng Wenbi, Weng Qingyun, Pan Wei, and Ding Mubing, whose works also sold quite a bit. Deng Bihua's handwritten Diamond Sutra horizontal plaque has a graceful and charming calligraphy style containing strength. If given time, her calligraphy will be immeasurable. The flowers and plants of Lu Zao and Lu Qin are ancient and elegant, and their bone strength and ink charm are all worth introducing.</p>
<p>I hope that in the future, our women will especially enthusiastically purchase and promote art and not give way to men. It is definitely not enough to just study some superficial fashions and decorations to show her beauty. In this era, many women only focus on imported art. For the essence of national art and literature, they seem to regard it as irrelevant. I believe that most modern women and wives, apart from being able to speak fluent English, rarely study China's inherent art. If you ask them where China's art is, I am afraid that nine out of ten of them will not be able to answer.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am twenty-one years old. At nineteen, I was betrothed through a matchmaker to a woman who is illiterate. We were engaged with the promise of lifelong companionship. Later, my family, due to my grandmother's frequent illnesses, wanted her to live with us to serve soup and medicine. Both parties agreed, so she moved in with my family. Afterwards, when I returned home from work, I taught her to read every day. Therefore, we were quite affectionate and had frequent opportunities to be close. Soon, we had a physical relationship. After it happened, I discovered that she... After we both spoke clearly, it turned out as I had expected. When she was fifteen years old, she had already had sexual relations with a man, about four or five times. But I am a pure virgin and have never had contact with a woman. She is no longer a virgin. How can she face me? So today, I am writing this incoherent letter to my dear editor, asking you to give me a satisfactory answer, okay? I would like to ask you to answer the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) She has already had relations with a man before. If I separate from her now, will I be guilty in the eyes of the law? (However, I have now had three contacts with her.)</p>
<p>(2) Suppose both parties do not divorce, will there be a good result?</p>
<p>(3) She is now a seventeen-year-old woman. Since I have lost my virginity to her, will it hinder my future?</p>
<p>(4) Should I file a lawsuit now? Or what other method should I use to deal with her?</p>
<p>Please give me a thorough instruction that will prevent me from suffering any mental stimulation. Sincerely, Lv Xinqi</p>
<p>Answer: Both men and women should maintain absolute chastity in engagement or marriage and must not have sexual relations with others. But before that, the other party has no right to ask about whether either party has had sexual relations with others and should not pursue it. In other words, chastity does not go back to the past, it only starts after the two are combined. This is the generally recognized concept of chastity today. You think she has failed you because your wife has had sexual relations with others before, which clearly shows that you are still too deeply influenced by the traditional concept of chastity. This is very inappropriate. Of course, we also admit that young men and women should not have sexual relations with others before they are engaged. But this only refers to his personal conduct and chastity. He does not bear the responsibility of chastity for his future spouse. So your wife, if she had sexual relations with others before she was engaged, you have no right to blame her at all. You feel a little regretful because you are a virgin and feel like you have lost your virginity to a woman who is not a virgin. It's funny to say she has failed you, and it's even more incomprehensible to use it as a reason for divorce. I respect you very much for maintaining your chastity before marriage, but may I ask, who doesn't have spring feelings during youth? During this period, if you were tempted by a woman and could not restrain yourself and had sexual relations with her, although this behavior is said to be inappropriate, do you think it should be forgiven? If you were blamed, would you feel that it was not harsh and be convinced? Why did your wife move in to live with you, because "the two were very affectionate, often had opportunities to contact each other, and soon had a physical relationship"? If you think calmly and put yourself in her shoes, I am afraid you will realize that your blaming her is too selfish and narrow-minded. You will laugh at yourself. Your prejudice cannot be used as a reason for divorce, so as long as it exists, you will be in pain and trouble. This is really asking for trouble. On the contrary, if you completely abandon this prejudice and completely forgive her, then she will definitely love you even more, and your "the two are very affectionate" will become "even more affectionate." Wouldn't life be very happy? The happiness of marriage requires the strength of both parties' love. If you marry a woman who was very chaste before, but there is no love between the husband and wife, this is what you can't say. So I hope you don't create trouble for yourself and ruin the relationship between the two, thereby ruining your very happy life.</p>
<p>As for the four questions you asked, they should not have happened, so I won't... Editor</p>

<p>"No, you have to know that it was Shimin who wanted me to knock it for him. I was just knocking it down for him, it wasn't what I wanted myself." That child retorted, "To be honest, you go tell his dad, I'm not afraid of him. Just because someone from their own family wants it, am I at fault for knocking it down for them?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Gray Chicken Woman turned to Shimin and said, "Did you tell him to knock it for you? Be careful your dad beats you to death when you get back. But you're bigger than him," she pointed at that child again, "If he wants it, you just knock it down for him? Why didn't you tell him that it couldn't be knocked down?"</p>
<p>"..." That child didn't say anything, and ran away with the original group of children, leaving his harvesters to return together.</p>
<p>As he was just entering the gate, he first saw his mother drying clothes in the courtyard. His mother saw him, and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Where did you run off to? Why did you sneak out early in the morning, making me search everywhere? You really worried me to death. Why didn't you tell me when you were going out? You're so young, running around outside, what if a con man tricked you? Later, I heard someone say that they saw you and Gray Chicken Brother go together, which put my mind at ease."</p>
<p>After a while, his aunt also came. Seeing that his body was covered with rounded mud balls, she knew that he had been catching crickets, so she went to get him a cricket cage and carefully placed them into the cages one by one. Soon, he heard his mother saying again:</p>
<p>"Come on, come eat porridge with me. You didn't eat all morning, you must be starving to death. And your braid isn't combed, looking so disheveled, aren't you upset?"</p>
<p>Shimin didn't want to go. He had caught so many crickets, and he immediately wanted to fight Aunt's Big-Headed Ghost once, to see who was better. But his mother definitely wouldn't allow it, and definitely would drag him to the kitchen. After washing his face, eating porridge, and combing his braid, and changing his shoes that were soaked by the dew, it took half a day to get him all tidied up before he could run away from his mother's side.</p>
<p>First and foremost, he took rice grains to feed the crickets, knowing that they must be very hungry, having not eaten anything all morning. He also ran to the vegetable garden to pick a few loofah flowers, and wanted the ones that still had dew on them. But it was already late, and the dew on the flowers had already been dried by the sun. There was no way, so he had to pick a few and soak them in clear water for a while, so that the flowers had a few drops of water on them, and just let them eat it...So he put the rice grains and loofah flowers into the cage, watching those crickets eating ravenously, almost able to hear the sound of them eating...</p>

<h3 id="e263">A Feud Between Chevalier and MacDonald? <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Sheng</p>
<p>Chevalier Denies First, MacDonald Clarifies Later</p>
<p>The feud between Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald has been rumored for a long time. The starting point, it is said, was because MGM asked Chevalier and MacDonald to collaborate again on "The Merry Widow," but Chevalier refused the suggestion. They say Chevalier refused because he didn't want to work with Jeanette again, because if he collaborated with Jeanette, her performance would definitely overshadow his. That would be too disadvantageous for him. This rumor has caused a lot of discussion in Hollywood. Later, Chevalier made a statement denying that he had refused to work with Jeanette. But despite the denial, the rumors continued unabated. One journalist specifically asked Jeanette about this matter again. Here is Jeanette's opinion on the matter.</p>
<p>"That's just ridiculous," Jeanette said. "How can they fabricate such rumors? You must think that there's another major dispute between two passionate stars, that they refused to cooperate with each other. In fact, where did the dispute come from? It's all nonsense! The journalist asked again, "Then what do you think of the rumors outside?" Jeanette said directly and frankly: "What else can I think, since there is no such thing? Maurice and I are now, and always have been, very good friends. There has absolutely never been any dispute between us. When I filmed with Chevalier, I never felt any ego in my heart. What else is there to say?" As she spoke, she tucked her jade fingers into her loose, curly, golden hair and combed it. She was still wearing a blue satin nightgown, which was truly charming. After a while, she continued: "Since I was a child, my mother always taught me not to participate in or be involved in any whirlpool of disputes. She said the best way is to not pay attention to that kind of dispute. My mother can set an example in this regard, carefully avoiding all neighborhood disputes and not participating in any opinions. This is a good lesson I learned from my mother, and in this matter, I especially want to listen to her instructions.</p>
<p>"At first, the rumors outside frightened me. Like a hurricane, spinning around me, I was completely a passive subject. But now it's good, Maurice himself came out to deny it, and I am actually the "Merry Widow", what else do I have to say, wouldn't it be creating another anticlimax? What I can say now is that I have been assigned the role of "The Merry Widow", and I am very happy. I know that my collaboration with Maurice will definitely make "The Merry Widow" a perfect work. But one thing I completely agree with Maurice's view is that Maurice and I are not inseparable old partners. We have starred in three films together before, namely "The Love Parade", "One Hour With You", and "Love Me Tonight." But everyone always thinks that we have starred in dozens of films together. In fact, Maurice has starred in many good films alone, and I have starred in many good films alone. However, when we cooperate, plus Ernst Lubitsch as the director, because Mr. Lubitsch is a genius director, it is bound to be successful. Now "The Merry Widow" stars Maurice and I, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, so we have high hopes for this film."</p>
<p>"Some people say that Chevalier is a little jealous of your success, do you believe it?" The journalist asked again. Jeanette said without thinking: "That's all nonsense. In "The Merry Widow", the two roles are at least equally important. Furthermore, Maurice himself is a very recognized artist, why would he want to film me stealing his show? Furthermore, I know very well that Maurice pays great attention to the entire structure of a film. He would never plan for himself and sacrifice the entire film, or adopt a second-rate role as his co-star for the sake of his own performance. I know Maurice very well, how can I believe the rumors outside? Since I don't believe it, what opinions can I express?"</p>
<p>It is found that "The Merry Widow" was filmed once before in 1903. Who the starring actor was, I can't remember for the moment. Now that Jeanette MacDonald and Chevalier are co-starring, of course, it will not be inferior to the previous works. This kind of remake of old movies, such as "White Sister", is also an example. Although it is due to the lack of subject matter, on the other hand, they can also allow us to review the past and learn new things, and will never make us feel bored.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e264">Review of "Let's Fall in Love" <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>LET'S FALL IN LOVE</p>
<p>| Great Light</p>
<p>From many films that mainly depict the inside story of the film industry, we can learn a lot about Hollywood, from the process of making films to their own exposure. Originally, this phenomenon was that film merchants sold themselves at all costs in order to cater to the curious interests of movie fans. This is a concrete manifestation of the commercialization of American films.</p>
<p>Now there is another similar story here. We might as well narrate it again.</p>
<p>A certain film company has a Swedish female star. She is very proud and looks down on everything. When she is filming, she refuses to let visitors stay on the set. She is not easy to cooperate with the director or co-stars she does not like. Therefore, when she is about to start filming a new film, she angrily leaves the set and goes home. There is no way but to find another actress who can replace her. Sure enough, the director found a new talent in the circus. In order to gain the trust of the producer and cater to the curiosity of the audience, he used various methods to say that the girl was also Swedish and that her acting skills were very good. Naturally, the producer allocated huge sums of money for publicity, and her reputation became overwhelming. Under such circumstances, the girl felt grateful to the director for his understanding and secretly fell in love with him. Who knew that it would arouse the jealousy of the director's fiancée, who publicly revealed their secret, and they were greatly embarrassed. But because of this excellent publicity material, the film was greatly noticed by the cinemas, who competed to purchase it. In this way, it stabilized the position of the director and the protagonist, and made them unite.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the story itself has no positive nature at all. At most, it is just an ordinary structure. However, if we understand that it is alluding to a certain event, it can bring a sense of lightheartedness to people. This is the success of this film's curiosity, and it is also the business success of the producer. Isn't it so? That proud Swedish star is very similar to the Greta Garbo that people have advertised. As for the creation of another fake Swedish star, we don't need to know what it alludes to, but that Jewish producer is being ridiculed enough.</p>
<p>From this aspect, we can see that the director not only wants the figure and movements of the person who plays Garbo to be similar, but also tries to imitate the pronunciation. Later, he did not use satirical techniques for the fake Swedish star and the director, making the audience seem to sympathize with them. This point is unknown, but the producer is doing his best to satirize the producer. The temperament of that businessman is so ridiculous by Gregory Ratoff's skillful performance. Assuming that the RKO's special war film "The Lost Patrol" starring McLaglen is screened at the Grand Shanghai</p>
<p>This film does have a relaxed effect, so naturally it has a lot to do with him.</p>
<p>From these places, we can see the director's full American special style. He uses extremely economical techniques and quickly passes through several processes in a fast tempo. In particular, the part where people see the advertisement for the heroine in the newspaper is very chaotic, which is even more wonderful. Similarly, for the director's fiancée in the play, she is also portrayed in four or five extremely short scenes, while the important scenes in the play are quite well grasped.</p>
<p>Lightness and liveliness are the essence of "Let's Fall in Love", but this is not what the protagonist Edmund Lowe did, but George Givot, who played Marx, was very successful. However, the new actor Ann Sothern did not see any special achievements, but was just mediocre.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e265">The "Three Sisters" is Too Tailed to Wagg the Dog <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>The day after The Song of the Fishermen was screened at Jincheng, director Huang Jinhuan's new work "Three Sisters" by Li Pingqian was also screened at the New Light Theater.</p>
<p>That was adapted from Kikuchi Kan's novel "New Pearl". I remember that when I was auditing at Tongwen, our professor (naturally a Japanese) compared Zhang XX with Kikuchi Kan's works because a classmate proposed it, and he (the professor) scolded the novels as being full of commercialism, and simply did not compare to Zhang's capital in China. Although I have not read his "New Pearl", and I do not know whether the "Three Sisters" after "New Pearl" was brought to the screen has undergone considerable changes from the original work? In short, although the Chinese film industry is in an era of script shortages, how can bringing "New Pearl" and other similar works over and calling it after the grand occasion of "Sisters Flowers" be compared?</p>
<p>After the same director Huang Jinhuan's "Golden Valley" was screened, it received higher evaluations from film critics, but that bright tail extinguished the power of the entire play. However, everyone knows that that is something that cannot be helped, so what about the "Three Sisters" now? The transformation of the eldest sister and the personality of the second sister are completely vague. Finally, Hu Die gave a long sermon and Ma Yicang was beaten. At least when the story progressed to this point, it was a time when people were very happy. However, in order to save the second sister's fiancé, the eldest sister, who had just realized her mistake, immediately knelt down to Ma Yicang and even wrote a submission. Although it gave Hu Die more opportunities to perform and the lower-class audience to laugh a few more times, I don't know how director Li explained to the audience who were holding greater hopes than "Golden Valley" about the tail in this tail?</p>

<p>The social masterpiece "Broken Dreams" starring Ms. Fan Xuepeng, has been approved to be screened at the Grand Central Theater from the 20th (Wednesday).</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3 id="e267">Sea Withered Stone Railing (Registered Nurse) (11) <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Extracted from Splendor</p>
<p>After the tragedy of James's suicide, one day, Peng was in the hospital packing her clothes and belongings into a small suitcase. Schuler was standing beside her watching, inevitably feeling a bit reluctant to part. She said, "Honey, I really hate to see you go. We've shared joys and sorrows and overcome difficulties together for several years now." Peng nodded and looked at Schuler, but had nothing to say. She had already considered it very carefully. She would soon be promoted to head nurse of the municipal hospital, but Miss McKenna had recently resigned to become the head nurse of a new hospital. She had contacted Peng, asking her to join her at the new hospital. Peng had agreed, but she wanted to rest first, and then go to a new environment, do new work, meet new people, and live in a new place—hoping she could change her mood. After McKenna and Peng left the municipal hospital, Schuler naturally rose to the position of head nurse. The increased responsibilities and workload could also give her some spiritual comfort. Therefore, Peng was willing to sacrifice the position of head nurse and go to a new place, letting Schuler be the head nurse of the municipal hospital. She and Schuler both understood that this was the best solution. They looked at each other and smiled bravely.</p>
<p>Suddenly the phone rang—Dr. Hightower requested Peng to come. Peng immediately ran to Hightower's office. Hightower was sitting behind his desk, his eyes staring blankly ahead. Peng's footsteps startled him, and he quickly stood up, speaking to her very earnestly, "So, you are leaving us now." Peng nodded, not knowing what to say. Hightower continued, "I'm afraid I should congratulate you." He said these words with great pain in his heart, but strangely enough, Peng shook her head and said, "No need." Hightower asked, "What's wrong? I thought—" "You thought what? Marrying Gregg? No. Hightower—"</p>
<p>His eyes widened, somewhat disbelieving. He had gritted his teeth to invite her here, prepared to say goodbye, watching her go with someone else. But now—it seemed a glimmer of hope had been reborn for him, which truly left him in bewildered surprise. He only heard a very gentle voice saying, "Sometimes, it takes a major change to see the truth of a matter—no, I'm just leaving this place to rest for a while, and then—" She didn't continue, only looking at Hightower.</p>
<p>Hightower's tense nerves suddenly relaxed. The corners of his mouth twitched slightly, and his eyes showed a hint of a smile. He slowly said, "In the canals of Venice, aren't there still gondolas to ride for pleasure?" Peng returned his smile, her first smile in a week. Her face still showed extreme fatigue, but her eyes radiated a new brilliance. She asked with a smile, "Venetian gondolas? That's something I've always wanted to have the chance to ride." Hightower, hearing this, gained even more courage and moved closer to Peng, earnestly saying to her, "Peng, are you telling the truth?" Peng smiled, and then Hightower said in one breath, "Let's abandon this hospital, and we'll go together, to Europe—Paris—Vienna—Rome—" Peng teased him, saying, "A doctor and a nurse, won't people gossip?" Hightower laughed, "How absurd! I forgot again! Peng, my darling, will you marry me?" They suddenly embraced each other, kissing passionately, but their joy was interrupted by the phone. They only heard Hightower say to the phone curtly, "What? Emergency? No one else?" Hightower hung up the phone, calling her to wait a moment as if he could do nothing. But Peng shook her head and said, "I won't wait—I'll help you." So they both got busy again. (The End)</p>
