<h3 id="c23">薩爾問題 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>說者皆謂近日歐洲局面之黯淡。可比諸一九一四年大戰爆發前夕之局面。而其癥結所在。仍不外乎德法關係之欠圓滿。邇來國聯行政院討論薩爾問題喧騰於報章。所謂薩爾問題。卽向來德法交惡之一導火綫也。</p>
<p>今請追溯此事件糾紛之原因。歐虽方酣。法國洛耳煤鑛損失甚鉅。迨凡衝賽和約成立。德國讓薩爾煤鑛權利於法。以資賠償。該鑛所屬之區域。則由國聯行政院設立政府委員會管理之。限期十五年。期滿舉行「公民投票。」以决定下開三項辦法之一。（甲）維持現行制度。（乙）歸併於法。（丙）歸併於德。上述）公民投票。（將於一九三五年舉行。其舉行。其舉行之的期。則由國聯行政院决定之。該院以一九三五年轉瞬卽届。定於日内籌備投票事宜。乃正式照會德法諸國。邀請與議。</p>
<p>方握德國政權之希特勒抵與其領道下之國社黨。向以反對凡爾賽和約而得國民之擁護。其由該約而放棄之薩爾權利。自願及早收回。而薩爾又佔軍事政治經濟各方之重要位置。更不容視若等閒。此所以迭有無條件立卽交還之要求也。不寗惟是。德國業爲軍備平等問題而與國聯相决絕。今若爲薩爾之公民投票一事。而派員至日内瓦。一則與其退出國聯之行動相矛盾。再則適足證明其無條件收回薩爾之主張爲不可行。希特勒氏拒絕國聯之請。自爲吾人意料所及。</p>
<p>法國態度之倔强。亦不下於德按薩爾曾爲法國領土。一八一五年以維也納條約割讓於德。其後百年間。普魯士移民源源而來。迄今居民中。大多數屬於德國國籍或出其血統。故法國縱有合併之心。亦自知甚難如願。不得已而退求其次。則希望設法維持現狀。蓋爲法國計。維持現狀有兩重利益。直接方面。可繼續採煤。以供全國之需要。而商業及投資權益。亦可保全無顱間接方面。可以限制希特勒氏之政治力量。勿因薩爾問題而牽動歐洲全局。而國聯之威信。亦不致因是而再行低落。由此觀之。德法兩國對於薩爾之問題利害衝突。又已極明顯。據凡爾賽和約規定。在該約簽字時倁居薩爾之法人。有權參加公民投票。法政府乃組織「薩爾法僑恊會。」預備給與參加投票之便利。而德國一切報章畫册。亦受其政认圾國社黨之授意。每日費一小時。向其薩爾同胞盡力宣傳。當地政府委員會雖迭加取締。而不能禁絕。法國輿論爲此大起鼓譟。督促政府實行干涉。並請願在國聯方面貫澈强有力之政策。凡此皆足表現薩爾問題已陷於極僵之一斑。</p>
<p>今者國聯突然採取嚴厲態度。通過薩爾區域管理委員長及各委員之任期。固與法國維持現狀之主張爲有利。惟德國方面。態度　爲激昂。並已顯然拒絕派代表列席與議。堅决表示其不合作之意此種形勢。愈覺其岌岌可危。歐洲大局前途。吾人誠不勝其憂慮矣。</p>

<p>第三軍長李揚敬、日昨由東江返省、向陳濟棠報告閩局狀况、及請示粤邊布置機宜、陳卽在桂花村私邸、召開會議、全省高級軍政長官俱列席、閩代表李章達亦參加、席間、討論至對付閩省問題、當局擬决派兵力三師開赴閩西南屯駐、分防上杭永定武平適中平和坎市靈霄詔安等縣、槪歸第二縱隊副司令黄任寰指揮、而政務亦仿從前贛南辦法、暫歸軍事機關統理、又對於蔡廷鍇等電請恊餉一節、刻以此間軍費、亦屬困難、决難辦到、又粤省此次收繳十九路軍後方辦事處槍械、純爲息謠計、應請閩當局原告諒云、李章達以此行不得要領、已决計一二日閩離粤矣、（一月十五日）</p>

<p>該院之巨獸舍、原分獅·虎·豹·熊·四舍、相連建築、當時因經費不敷、且應各界要求、提前開放、故祇有獅虎兩舍、而豹熊暫搭鐵柙置放、以致支年有黑熊一頭、因鐵釘中斷、突然出柙、該院爲避免危險計、特呈請敎育局撥欵添建、以保萬全、旋經敎局核准、轉請工務局招標興建、迄今全部工程、已完全三分之二、巨獸舍純以鋼骨水泥砌成、大約本月底工竣、所遺豹·熊·兩鐵柙、另以别種動物放置、熱帶動物室、現已早晚開放水汀取煖</p>

一個大律師還豐富，這是千眞萬眞的事實。　　我是受盡了痛苦，欲求去痛苦根源的一人。年來所知較多，現在想進一步將眼睛看遠一點，作出了以上的計劃。希望你們加以批評與糾正，　　如果認爲可用的話··第一，請指示我具體的進行的步驟；第二，請多多供給正確，槪括的書籍；或介紹雜誌上某一論文。最近就想你們替我指示幾本關於資本主義的機構的書籍。丨丨（何永泉來信）　　代啓··　　爲减輕通信諸君經濟負擔起見，覆信郵　　資槪歸本部負責，來信不必附寄郵票。　　　　　讀書指導部來函　　逕啓者、今見貴報本埠新聞内所載、各團體聯席會議、市商會代表葉家興提出幾個議案、（一）用大會名義、慰勞蔣委員長及前敵剿匪將士案、（二）援助金晳志士案、（三）援助劉崇武案、（四）呈請市政府訓令社會局迅予解决閘北火險賠償案、查以上各案、鄙人並非代表市商會所提、相應函達、請予更正爲荷、此致申報館、葉家興謹啓、一月十八日、　　誌謝　昨承商務印書館惠贈東方雜誌第三十一卷第二期英語週刋第六十五期、各一册、謝謝招領　　如有走失男女者請注意此處地位社會局啓第二二零號、女性、朱阿松、如臯人、十二歲、民國二十三、年五月三十一日、由市公安局送中國救濟婦孺會留養、第二二零六號、女性、吳寳奴、杭州人、十七歲、民國二十三年五月三十一日、由地方法院送中國救濟、婦孺會留養、第二二零七號、男性、朱錫金、諸蠶人、十五歲、民國二十三年六月二日、由虹口捕房送中國救濟婦孺會留養、

<p>春秋天氣變遷說  清癯　　近幾日的氣候，比那以前要冷得多了；前幾星期寒暑計的温度常在五六十度左右，好像還没有到嚴冬時候一般；照陰曆算起來，已交了小寒，那末，當然要朔風凛冽，刮得薄寒中人，瑟縮可憐，這是大自然界的最酷烈的一境；古人說；「天不爲人之　其寒而贛其冬，」就是人類對那四季當中的冬節，萬物雖都已收藏，而在這個陰霾籠罩，彤雲密布的當兒過生活，想無論那一個終覺得不大舒服；卽使住在密室裏頭，烯着火爐，擁了重裘，終日不吹着一些冷氣，其實也未必見得冬天，比那别的時季來得快爽，而况無衣無食，窮苦的小民，究竟不曉得有多少在那裏號寒。甚且就在街頭衖口受凍，以至於殞斃，而不能起死回生，所以天氣，嚴寒，就是窮民的敵，這是没有方法和彼蒼去商量，要求他哀憐呢！　　但是我記得在中日戰爭的前一年，大約前清光緒十九年的秋間，時纔過了重陽，上海天氣，已經異常寒冷，雖御絮袍不温。而有穿羔皮，戴風帽，（此帽現已不見），方敢出門，有一天我在福建路天仙茶團看汪大頭和謝雲奎，合串龍虎鬥，待至出戲圍門，已一白如銀，曉得天已下雪多時了；這一年，可算得是最冷，到了明春，衖堂裏的石板，因爲陋年結了厚冰，大半爆裂而破壞，修砌的工人，忙得不了；有延到三四月裏，尙未完成，這也是一個紀念；後來戊戌變政的那一年，更好時在八月中秋後，没有幾天，還下了一塲雪，雖不見得凝結像白銀世界，而搓棉扯絮紛紛　下，屋瓦亦　得肥胖，有人還說··這是「天道南行一證」，（記得本報，還有論說一篇，講先冬降雪，關係國家的利害，）現在呢！天氣像又有些不同了，在冬季裏倒不很寒冷，一到了春初的時候，翻轉來要大冷而特冷，這是什麽緣故呢？科學家說··巴瑙運河開後，天氣早已劇變，所以北方也可不封河了，尤奇的，就是吾們江蘇省裏見雪，也要待首都降後，再慢慢地降到上海來，像皚皚的白雪、乘着京滬火車而來、也覺得年年不爽，豈不是奇怪的一個很有趣味很有研究的事實麽？故吾寫出來給大家想想！大學校的·············韜  　　林語堂先生在上海各大學演講「關於讀書的意見，」他說··學校不是讀書的地方。自然這種現實的敎育現象到了善於幽默的人的嘴裏給他這麽地一分折，無疑的會更動聽而引起似乎是看馬戲一般的聽衆不斷的笑聲。那麽大學校的一切到底是什麽東西？穿洋服挺胸凸肚的大學府的大學生當然也知道的，並且是他們日常的功課吧！　今略舉於後··丨丨　　學生是學校的搖錢樹··　　女學生和運動員是學校的義務活動廣告。　　敎授是温故而支薪的機械（温習舊講義而拿薪棒丨借林先生語）。　　宿舍是大飯店。　　圖書館是會情人的地方。　　厠所的墻壁是自由論壇。　　敎室和辦公廳是敎授和學生唸經撞鐘的地方，必要時也可變作戰塲　（起風潮罷課時包圍的所在）。　　大槪還有，不過我想不起來了。誰都知道的！大學校是出錢買學分換學位的商店，祇要你有錢，就可以去零買或躉批，付了錢不去或請人代到不要緊，你儘可以去逛跳舞塲或陪愛人去　電影好了，他們决不會向你干涉的。兩小時的迷變  醉痴生　　在現代『光怪陸離』的都市裏，有時會遇到『不可思議』的玩意兒。尤其是，和異性相接。往往弄得你莫名其妙，使你身同傀儡，任人擺佈。以下所載··便是在下的朋友×先生，一段自述的故事。算是艶遇，也算是趣聞。眞値得人們低徊贊嘆！　　×先生年紀五十多歲了，素有寡人之疾。一天傍晚，他到某游戲塲品玩。戴上老光眼鏡，正在細細賞鑒『異性美』的當兒··忽然覺得有人在他肩胛上一拍，嬌聲道··對不住，請問你，吃中餐在那裏？他回頭一看，原來是三位摩登女郎。容光嬌艶逼人，都盈盈含笑。最稚的，年華十八九。那和他問話的，年略長些，約有二十餘歲光景。×先生經此一問，就答道··那餐館在第幾層某處。那女子又道··那末，請你領導吧，省得我們去找尋。×先生聽了，不期然而然的跟伊們走。幾位女子邊說邊走，還問×先生貴姓什麽？府上在何處？×先生一一回答，也問過了伊們的姓。走到中餐部門首，要想告别。那女子忽道··先生用過晚膳没有？×先生回說··未曾。那幾位女子又同聲道··那再好没有了，請你陪着我們一同吃吧。一朝生，兩朝熟，你也不用客氣。×先生受了這嚦嚦鶯聲的包圍，覺得盛情難却。又不期然而然的，跟伊們踏了進去。堂倌拿了菜單上來，伊們又客氣來了，說··我們年紀輕，不懂得甚麽，還是請你先生代點吧。×先生就徵求伊們的同意，點了幾樣可口的肴。又呌了兩壺酒，和伊們淺斟低酌、有說有笑。方知那年長的是嫂，那二個是姊妹行，住在租界某處。幾人殷勤勸杯，一種親熱態度，眞要使當之者受寵若驚，詫爲畢生艶遇。到了飲啖已畢，堂倌拿了賬單，交給他心目中的主人×先生。這一來，×先生倒有些爲難了。看了看，共計大洋五元八角。一手摸到衣袋裏，要想　皮夾的樣子，勉强的說··讓我來做個東道主吧！不料伊們都附和着說··萍水相逢，要你來請客，那眞對不住了。我們祇好下次來回敬吧！×先生又不好空手伸出來，就取了兩張花紙給堂倌。連找出的零錢，也敬了額外之賞。伊們三人說了聲謝謝，又說了聲再會。都姗姗的，扭着腰肢去了。×先生眼巴巴的，望着伊們的後臀，覺得經過的一切幻境，都已消失，眞有些呆了。事後，×先生還這樣說··我費六塊錢的代價，總算換了兩小時的迷戀。不過這『女性的謎』，到底没有猜透，其中含着什麽神秘的意味？嗅專家  任培初　　藝術有專家··科學有專家，······我未嘗聞「嗅」也有專家的。前天讀本刋「銀楓」君撰的「靠鼻頭賺錢的嗅專家」一文後，才知道世上又多出一種專家來了。　　據銀楓君說··英國有二位「嗅專家」，都當了代騐師。他們化騐起東西來，不用甚麽器械或藥料，祇須用他們的鼻頭嗅嗅。而且絲毫没有錯誤的。　　寳貴啊！這兩個鼻頭，的確是二十世紀的無上寳物！　　蘇州「雷允上藥舖」，他們秘製了一種「六神丸」，幾十年來，風行全國，它的功效是大家都知道的，至於它的内部用甚麽藥來配成的，那可没有人知道了，而且化騐都化騐不出。據說··他們這張丸方，是轉子不傳婿的，秘藏得比甚麽寳貝還要尊貴。丨自然啦，每年要賺幾十萬哩丨但是這樣秘密下去，將來未免要失傳吧！這個悶葫蘆，倒可以請敎「嗅專家」去打破它。　　醫生診斷疾病，雖然用了聽音機和愛克司光鏡等器械，然而還是往往有錯誤，假使「嗅專家」能致力於疾病診斷方面研究一下，的確可以打倒一切醫生用的檢查器物。東北四連長  張恨水第二十三回　創痛難堪凝神聽鼓樂　歡情未洽促别飛符到　　積之道老大爺你爲什麽讓他入軍界，不就爲了他可以升到軍長師長嗎！趙翁道··要論到作官發財呢，那一個不想。自强初進軍界，我是不大贊成的。後來他已經在裏面混了兩年了，我倒不願他離開。這爲着什麽呢？一個人掘井，只要掘一個，老掘下去總會有水。再說，他那樣一個人才，無論幹什麽事，也不能爲國家出力，倒除非是當兵。現在國家多事，我呌他不當兵，我是呌兒子吃太平糧的，我不幹。你别瞧我是個買賣人，要論到我愛國這一分熱心，可不比人差。你不贊成人家當兵嗎？積之想了一想笑道··當然是贊成的。可是全中國有二百多萬兵。咱們平良心說一句，爲了愛國來抗槍桿的，你說有幾個吧？趙翁回頭看着，笑了一笑，下面有一句話待要說出。但是他自己，似科有了什魔感觸，不曾說出來，又忍回去了。積之看趙翁那樣子，又不免是一番不高興。這就想着，我今天是怎麽了，說起話來，老是透着鋒鋩逼人。所幸這個老頭子還是有涵養的，若是遇着别個撅老頭子，三言兩語，撅我一頓，我總也不能和老前輩去抬扛。想到這裏，自己透关後悔，也就斷斷續續的，只有把一些閑話，在驢背上和趙翁說着。趙翁雖不置可否，却也有話答話，不肯把積之冷落了。到了家裏，天色已是昏黑時候，大門恰是未曾關閉。趙翁心裏很有些子不痛快。也不曾作聲，悄悄的走回後院子去了。坐在屋子裏，抽了幾袋旱烟靜靜的想了一想。（二九五）夜上宋皇臺  乃令　　意外地到了香江，又意外地游了宋皇臺。　　宋皇臺位於香江對岸的九龍城畔，臨着一泓青碧的水灣；相傳是宋帝　避難至此，所寄居過的地方。　　我們上宋皇臺去，是在一個明月較潔的夜晚；時間已經是十點左右了。爲了楚石的慫恿，平徐又答應帶一支横笛去，德銘跟我也就只好同行了。我們從旺角步行，一路踏着荒凉的柏油路，四個人邊說邊笑的前進着。　　路旁的人家，多數已滅燈入睡了。伴着我們的孤寂的，就只有一輪揖於碧天的明月，幾聲遠遠的犬吠聲。　　「呵！眞是饒有詩趣的夜色！」　　詩人的楚石這樣贊美的說。　　載欣載奔地，不多幾時我們便到了宋皇臺的臺脚。常常來訪的楚石跟平徐，也把入路迷失了。大家在臺脚，披荊斬棘的踏着，找尋上宋皇臺去的路。　　借這時機，我仰望這有名的宋皇臺。原來就是一座普通樣子的小丘，高可四丈，前後左右是全生滿着叢木的。　　「對了，從這里上去。」　　德銘的呌聲打斷了我的仰視。於是我們沿着石基，一步一步，慢慢地爬了上去。到了上面，却是一大片平臺，但是絕少叢木，而且還隱約的窺出一條一條的人行小徑。　　這時候風吹着茵草，瑟瑟的響，使我打了一個寒噤；心想在這樣的深夜，到這種絕少人跡的地方來，實是不大合算。想雖這麽想，可是就在這時候，我們迫近了臺的中央了。　　臺的中央，用水門汀的矮欄，團團地把一塊大石圍住。大石的高，闊，約有三丈直徑。跑近前去，跳進欄里，我便發見這大石的上面，寫着三個斗大的字··「宋皇臺」。大石的下面，也還有兩塊石頭把它撑住。據楚石說，相傳宋帝昺就是住在這塊大石之下；且大石與撑住大石的二石頭之間，雖没空罅，也可用繩子穿過的。語固無稽，但是這無稽之談的來源，我想也必定是有因的吧？　　這當兒，趁着海風，平徐吹起横笛來了。　　笛的悲凉，幽怨，悽愴的音響，咬住了我的心。好似許多無名的悲情，都如潮般的湧上心頭，感到極度的惆悵！但是，楚石的歌聲又起了！歌聲雖没有笛聲的宛轉動人，而詞藻之幽怨，富麗，確也同樣的令人神往！　　我向前遙望，瞧見遠遠的香江，像全身披着鑽石的艶女，閃閃爍爍的燈光照下灣裏映成一幅「桃花怒放」的繡畫。而近處的點點漁火，更使人爲之贊嘆不已！　　笛，歌之音，還吁咿的續響；可是夜風已加倍的凉了，身上的秋呢外衣，好似有抵擋不住的形勢，我不得不把領子也拉高了。一直到了月子已升在中天的時候，平徐楚石的笛歌之聲才略爲停歇了。終於，大家好似依依不捨的離了宋皇臺。但給那落在後邊的平徐，仍不時的吹起笛音，獨自逗留在荒凉的半山上，當我們下至臺脚的時候。短訊　元旦創刋之航空小叢書，旨在灌輸最新航空學識，内容非常充實，每星期出版一種，第一期「斷臂隊長」業於八日出版，係描述空軍在杭州抗日作戰之偉蹟，石邦藩斷臂，趙甫明陣亡，其事尤爲慘烈，函索樣本或訂購全年，可逕函杭州航空署情報科航空小叢書編行部，全年五十二册訂價二元六角，各省市大書店均有代售。</p>

<p>自由談小學敎育與社會  郁達夫　　自己的小孩，進了幼穉園之後，本來是一天到晚在家裏搗亂的頑童，居然也曉得起唱歌，寫字，作畫，行禮來了；那一位德國牧師的兒子弗利特利幾·弗留倍兒（FriedrichFroebel）的偉大，到現在、我纔切身地感到。　　統觀中國各地的小學敎育，除有些實在是荒僻得不堪的地方，仍在遵守着中國傳統的私塾制外，大抵都改良，進步，而且也很有成效了；可是中國的社會全體，以及服務丨丨尤其是做官丨丨的人才，刦反而一天比一天的壞，那又是什麽緣故呢？若要歸罪於敎育，我想總是中學，或大學的不對罷？小學敎育是容易統一，改善的；而小孩子的習氣，也大半是於進中學或大學之後，煊染而成。所以盧騷的愛彌兒，羅素的敎育論，對於十二三至二十餘的那一段年齡，都不肯放鬆。中國的虐待小學敎員，（如薪金的微薄，勞働時間的增多，任職保障的全無等），原是使中中國敎育墮落的一個原因，但大學中學的當局之不負責任，將學校視作衙門，以敎育追隨政治，當然又是更大的原因無疑。　　還有我們一出大學，一入社會，就以爲敎育是與我們無關了；做人和讀書，或做官發財和敎育，是像牛肉和金鋼鑽一樣的完全無關的那一種觀念，或者也許是促成中國社會紊亂的最後最大的一箇總原因。　　中國古人說··『學到老！』雅典的立法者所龍（Solon）說··『我在常是不斷地學着的中間一年年的老了。』敎育中年人的中年學校，和敎育老年人的老年學校，世界上當然是没有的，重要的不過是在我們入社會之後自己對自己反省，和社會相互間的提倡勉勵而已。苦笑錄  殊　　在「結鄰集」裏，我看到一個最會苦笑的人。這裏所謂苦笑，和一般的意思稍有不同，我想最恰當是解作「窮開心」。這人是何來。在他與减齋的幾封信裏，自己解嘲得很有趣，而由此也可以使我們看到他的窮窘狀况。如云··　　五日近矣，節債逼人，方知屈大夫從　　彭咸之所居，只是躱端午耳，公當一　　笑。　　屈平投江，竟是躱債，此話眞是想入非非。也可以看到此公眞是窮極無以自慰，找屈原來作爲「同調」，公眞當「一笑」矣。云云··　　數日米價頓長、舉家不能辟榖。冬衣典盡，而質褲又不容葛衫抵出，非餓死應凍死矣。縱是活釋迦佛活濓洛關閩，也挨不過如此冷清。公雖無聊，尙想到參禪學道，勝我多多許也。　　這一封信是祇有苦没有笑。而最後幾句話，更有一篇大道理，參禪學道，也畢竟要有錢纔行。若家有老小，身又無積蓄留給他們吃喝的人，簡直是辦不到。可是此公究竟忍不住要笑，所以再來一封信，却又要令你哭笑不得了。　　兀兀幽居，幾歲盡不知年矣。乃因豪債追呼，始憶年前無幾日，通身汗下，如觸翻溺哭時也。窮親貧友索歷日，與追呼等。敢以此小小債累先生，多多益善。　　「如觸翻溺器時」，這一妙喩，眞虧此公想得出。菜販  周楞伽　　外面有的是砭骨的寒風，鵝掌大的雪片，銀色的世界、亞鉛色的冰凍的天。　　時間只在六點鐘左右，天剛透出一些魚肚白色，有錢人還都臥在熱被窩裏，迷迷糊糊的做着好夢。可是他，一個靠賣菜過活的小販，爲了生活，却不能不勉强忍着寒冷，上下牙齒捉對兒厮打得閣閣作響的，從床上爬起身來了。　　黑暗的草屋裏瞧不見一綫天光。他從牀頭摸索到一盒火柴，「嗤」的一聲，點上了那一隻僅有的煤没燈。黄弱的光燄照着這搖搖欲倒的屋子。大的雪片儘從罅漏處直鑽進來。屋裏所有的傢俱雜物都顯得非常破敗。　　　「這樣的生活眞比猪狗都不如」！他忍不住長長的歎息了一聲。　　在他脚頭躺着的老婆痛苦地翻了一個身，發出一聲「唉！」的呻吟，半意識的朦朧地問他道··　　『又要出去了嗎？』　　他没有回答，只是趿他的草鞋，心裏暗暗的作痛。老婆患的是很厲害的瘧疾，時寒時熱的，一直拖延着不見好。在這樣寒冷的冬天，熱的時候還不怎樣，冷的時候可眞作孽，　　把一根扁担穿進兩隻空菜籃裏挑上了肩，腋下挾着一柄油紙傘，他便走出了門。一陣冷風挾着雪片撲到他面上，使他忍不住打了個寒噤。屋裏的煤油燈很快的被風吹熄了。　　雪在他的脚下「Ziaz」「Ziza」地響，他走到了他種菜的地方。那四四方方的一片菜畦裏，已全被雪蓋滿了，只略微露出一些綠色來，他熟習地走進去，把用慣了的割菜刀割着菜。現在是比從前更多了一種工作，要留心地把菜上的雪打掉。這樣割了半天，好容易把兩隻菜籃割滿，他的手指已經凍得像紅蘿蔔一樣了。　　經過了霜雪打的菜，味道是很鮮美的，可是他却連一片菜葉都不能到嘴。　　自己種菜自己却没得吃，多麽不平的人生呵！　　仍舊「Ziza」「Ziza」的踏着雪，一直走到小菜塲去。雪在他的脚下漸漸的没有了，代替了的是比雪地還要難走的滑滑的泥濘。這泥濘，有好多次幾乎滑跌了他。他只得把穩了扁担，小心在意的走路。　　在擺着魚攤的那個熟識的魚販子一柄大的油布罩傘下，他歇下了他的菜担。時候還很早，來買菜的人一個都没有。他站着，手籠在袖裏，腿脛上一片冰冷直冷進他的心。風和雪仍舊毫不容情地不住向他身上猛撲。　　一個賣粢飯的在他身旁停下了，熱騰騰的粢飯的香氣，和油條的香氣，儘鑽進他鼻裏來。這確是一種很大的誘惑，他的肚裏開始覺得有些餓了。可是摸一摸身邊，他又終於只有乾咽了一口　沫　　買菜的人漸漸多起來了，小菜塲裏的空氣突然顯得異樣熱鬧，滿街都擠滿了提着竹籃的女人，有的是跟人家帮傭的娘姨大姐，有的却是撑着紅綠綢傘穿着皮鞋的精明的太太奶奶。　　「這青菜賣幾個子一斤？」一位漂亮的女太太站在他面前問。　　「九個子。」　　「九個子，太貴，從來就是八個子。」　　　着這女顧客掉頭要走了，他只得跌下價來··　　「好，就八個子。」　　於是便取出隨身帶的一管小秤來，稱了一斤菜給她。而那女顧客還很不滿意的咕嚕着，從他的菜籃裏搶了一大把菜去。　　人們大槪都是黑良心的，喜歡在窮人頭上刮。一個子算得什麽？而還要佔便宜！還要搶菜！　　就這樣在討價還價中做着賣買，一直到正午時分，纔出空了他的菜籃。他也像别的菜販一樣，挑着空籃回家去。　　一雙在冰冷泥濘的地上站了幾個鐘頭的脚，已經凍僵得失去知覺了，連舉步都非常費力。他一壁走，一壁揣着沉重的腰包。肚裏覺得餓，腦海裏却又很快的閃過了生病的老婆的影子。　　「這裏的一些錢，怕還不够給她請一個郎中呢？」他痛苦地想。松江半日記  華尙文　　年假期中，和幾位朋友到松江去游了一次。　　由上海到松江，不過一個多鐘頭的火車，若坐滬松長途汽車，恐怕還要快點。這樣短距離的旅行，本來不値得記的；不過，自己前前後後在上海住了總有十多年，像松江這樣近的地方，這回還是第一次去游，自然多少總得了點新的印象，要不趁早記下來，不久便會湮没的。　　提起松江，人便會聯想到鱸魚。的確，松江的鱸魚是太有名了。去游松江的人大槪也都是志在鱸魚的。招待我們的主人公十分體貼，特别凖備着這珍羞來滿足我們的欲望。當我們下了早班快車到了他的家中，寒暄以後，他便很快活的告訴我們、鱸魚已經凖備好了。休息了一個多鐘頭以後，大家被招待到圓的飯棹上。四只拚盤，兩壺老酒，接着便是各色各樣的佳肴絡繹不斷地端上來。旣醉且飽，大家差不多什麽都忘記了，忽然，一大盤巨口細鱗，微帶着黑色的新鮮小魚擺在大家的面前。哦！這就是　魚！主人公用筷子撥開那帶紅色的小腮，丨丨是的，的確是雙重。大家馬上拿起筷子，好像疾風掃落葉一般，一隻大盤子差不多立刻就被收拾得乾乾凈凈了。主人公又說明這　魚肺是特别的，要吃了肺才算吃到　魚。於是大家又趕快在剩下的魚腹中找那小肺。等到這名貴的小魚完全進了大家的胃囊以後，我們就開始下半天的游覽工作。　　我們的目的是登塔。因爲在火車上已經看見了兩座高塔。去登塔的路上，要經過民衆敎育館。怡巧這天松風社在這裏開書畫展覽會，我們便順路進去看看。同行的Ｗ君是書家，Ｍ君是美術家，像沙堆中檢金子一樣，他們兩個特别注意的看着。Ｍ君指着一幅洋畫嘆息着說··　　「部分地去看，也有好的地方，但全體郤完全没有統一調和。作者也許自命爲什麽印象派，未來派呢。中國的洋畫，基礎工夫還没有做好，便有人出來提倡歐美的最新流派，因此後學不免走入歧途了。」　　看過展覽會，我們便向西關走去。這裏和府前，據說同是松江市中最熱鬧的地方。但是街路的狹隘和店鋪的簡陋，十足地表示出一個被榨取的落後的小都市。在紅綠紙裝飾的店鋪中間，偶然發現了一兩間小門面的作坊，使人更加深了手工業社會没落的感慨。　　東嶽廟裏，吃食攤，小販攤和算命先生的棹子雜然陳列着，可是，雜沓的樣子，遠不及上海的城隍廟，或蘇州的玄妙觀。許多人都圍着在看一隻白色的山羊。　　Ｃ君說··　　這山羊有一種奇怪的脾氣，他能吃香烟。　　（未完）兩兄弟（九）（○）  莫泊桑着李維克譯　　「瞧啦···瞧啦···」羅蘭老是呌喊着，「它筆直地向我們這裏走來了。」　　於是博齊汝開心極了，反覆地說··　　「我剛才說的不錯罷，嚇？我不是熟悉它們的航路嗎？」　　哲安低低地對他母親說··　　　「看啦，媽媽，它走近來了。」　　於是羅蘭媽媽睜開了那雙被淚水蒙住了的眼睛。　　在這清朗，寗靜的好天氣，一走出港灣便盡力疾馳着的「洛蘭勒」郵船，已經走近來了。博齊汝凑上望遠鏡報告道··　　「當心啦！筆爾行钱立在船後，獨自個兒，看得很清楚。當心啦！」　　像山那麽高，火車那麽快的輪船，現在差不多從「珍珠」號身邊擦過似的走過了。異常奮激着，狂亂着的羅蘭媽媽，向好的兒子伸着兩臂，她看到了她的兒子，她的兒子筆爾，戴着他那綴着帽章的制帽，用兩手擲給好一些訣别的接吻。可是他走了，他逃了，消失了，已經變得很小了，好像那大船上的一個看不見的小黑點似的被抹去了。她還想盡力地瞧出他來，但她再不能分辨出他了。　　哲安拿着好的手說··　　「你看到他了嗎？」　　「看到了。他眞好啊！」　　於是大家轉身向城裏駛去。　　「嚇，這走得眞快，」羅蘭帶着一種熱忱的確信說。　　郵船是確乎一秒鐘一秒鐘的縮小了，彷彿它已融解在大洋裏面似的。羅蘭媽媽轉身向它，瞧着它没入地平線底下，向一個陌生的陸地，世界的另一端走去。在這隻什麽都不能阻住的船上，在這隻她立刻就要看不到的船上，有着她的兒子，好的可憐的兒子。好覺得好的半邊心也隨着他走了，她並覺得她的生命已經完結了，她還覺得她永遠不能再見着她的孩子了。　　「你哭什麽呢？横竪他不到一個月又要轉來的。」她的丈夫問。她吃吃的回答··　　「我不知道。我因爲心裏難過所以哭着。」　　當他們回到了陸上時，博齊汝立刻和他們分别到一個朋友家裏去赴午宴去了。於是哲安和陸醉米太太走在前面，羅蘭對他的女人說道··　　「無論如何，我們哲安的品貌狠不壞呢。」　　「是呀。」母親回答。　　因爲她的精神太亂了，她不知不覺地又補說道··　　「我是非常高興他娶着陸醉米太太的。」　　這好好先生大吃一驚道··　　「啊呀！怎的？他要娶陸太太嗎？」　　「是呀。我們早已算好就在今天來徵求你的同意的。」　　「嚇！嚇！這事你們已經商量着好久了嗎？」　　「啊！没有。不過是幾天的事情。哲安想要確實知道她會同意時，再來和你商量。」　　羅蘭老爹搓着雙乎說··　　「好極了，好極了。這是非常好的。我是絕對贊成。」當他們快要離開碼頭，走上佛朗梭一巨大街時，他的女人還回轉身一次，向大海投着最後的一瞥；可是　祇看見一點點灰色的烟，那樣遙遠，那樣輕微，簡直有些像霧一樣。（完）</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言德式的梟首  雯　　所謂德國會縱火案的「主犯」荷人魯白，已經於一月十日在菜潑齊法院上斷頭台了。從帝國主義新聞記者繪影繪聲之描寫的電訊中，使我懂得德國政府之以人「示衆」也，畢竟比其他「落後的民族」來得更愼重將事，更具備科學的精神。你看··當那「喀嚓」悲劇表演之一殺那間，到塲的有聯邦法院院長，總檢官，國家律師，推事，醫生，牧師丨丨應有盡有。可見德國國民之被「示衆」，是非常之稀少，而政府對於殺人之「則古凖今」，刀隨淚下（？），也就不難想見。　　因國會縱火一案而把政權囫圇到手，再用最慘酷的刑罰把這舉世矚目的大案件作一悲劇的結束，從這裏我們大可看出好一位生着與卓别麟一樣之小鬍子的希特拉先生的手段、畢竟是偸天換日，迴異凡儔。然而那鐵腕下的巨靈之掌，終於從指縫裏現了一點「小紕漏」。據哈瓦斯柏林電··「······僅魯白證明係從火主犯，判决死刑，但魯白當審問時，已失其身體能力，故此案終成疑獄······。」可見魯白那個不幸的人，在他被捕後就被紅卍字黨人施以特别的手術，成爲一個麻木不仁，不能自辯的「活屍」，他的身首異處，似乎在人們損壞他的神經構造時，就已經决定了的。究竟魯白是不是國會縱火案的「眞正主犯」？那只有「天知，地知，希特拉知」而已！　　又在去年年底，各報曾載··「國社黨幹部新製黨徽一種，以卍字爲底，上鐫骷髏，限定要黨軍領袖及特務組首領之有卓異功績，始得授予明希特拉及其黨衆在政治上之「骷髏主義」的精神。魯白之被殺頭，是製造一枚骷髏，瘋狂地備戰，是打算造成無數骷髏。而且，限定要「黨軍領袖」和以殺人爲專業的「特務組」首領，纔得授予骷髏黨徽，更可見要長於製造骷髏者，方得受上賞。說句迷信的話，希特拉先生們恐怕是「應刦下凡」的「星君」罷！我希望成一個殘廢的人  麥夫　　上星期我的耳朶忽然由「鳴」以致「聾」了，回憶起來，聾的滋味，直像走進了深邃的山洞，慒慒然地，一切都失了常態，與人對話，只見别人的嘴唇在一張一闓，連自己說出來的也聽不大清晰。這時我眞急了，平日耳聰的時候，不曾感覺到它之可愛，也就對它隨而便之，幾次生耳病，是算拖過去了。這番，三日而後，聾得更厲害了，怔得我心兒忐忑，急忙上醫院，幸而醫生高明，診斷奏效，又三日，便恢復了常態。　　一向我本爲着這而慶幸，耳聾可眞不是玩意兒也！　　然而今天我却忽然覺得這實在是庸人之念，換句話說，耳聾未始不是好事，應該任它聾下去，以致醫藥罔效的殘廢境地，然後必有或種好處。　　爲什麽呢？這，說來可眞話長。　　在這年代裏，事實告訴我們，學聰明是傻子，就是五官生得健全，也都是闖禍招尤惹愁致患的，只有殘廢的人是最好，所以要想做個好人，就得先殘廢，至少我一個子是這麽相信着。　　我有「自知之明」，不是聰明人，也不想學聰明，更不妄自誇詡，偸掛「先</p>

<p>知先覺」或「幹幹革命」「爲國效死」等等類類的新牌。然而我的五官究竟還健全，也就正爲了這個，招惹了半半百年來了的憂患，到如今很希望成一個殘廢的人了。　　這有事實證明。　　比如說，我的一雙眼睛是健全的，不是近視眼，也不是遠視眼，也不是鷄蒙眼，因之我能透視事態的究竟，社會的黯淡面就清晰的呈現在我的眼前。　　這世界，在某一部份人看來，確是値得歌頌，雖則有餓死的人，也有凍死的人，但某一部份的人只管縱慾，享樂，上海就没有四季，永遠的沉溺在春醪裏，只見肉與錢的交響。但，究竟怎樣呢？我們的眼睛是健全的，看得分明，這世界可眞不像某一部份人看來的那樣好，隨處是矛盾，缺陷，罪惡，黑暗，······。　　我的兩隻耳朶也正健全，（雖則曾經生過毛病）震盪我耳邊的音響，是那麽清晰，不是　舞，而是痛哭，不是生的歡呼，而是死的呐喊，使我聽來，知道這世界究竟没有寬懷的地方。　　因爲我的兩眼是健全，因爲我的兩耳也健全，所以就能吸收這世界的一切的現象。否則那也罷了。　　而且，我的小腦雖不機智，却也還健全，目所見，耳所聞，再曰神經通達到腦海，定下一種模型，於是小腦就要作威了，演繹出各種的思路，時常在腦海裏跳躍不靖，想找一個發洩的機會，想找一點歸宿。　　而且，我的舌頭，也還健全，手指也還没有疾廢，我不是啞子，也不是瘰指，這就糟了！一切的憂患就從此爆發。否則那也罷了。　　生平就多了一把心快口快的嘴，（雖然不善辭令）每每喜愛嚕囌，凡是看不慣聽不慣的事，我都要給他一個相當的抨擊。以是許多朋友都不願與我往來了，爲的就是我愛說閒話，而且說將起來的時候，面孔也是怪難看的。就是手下筆端闖來的禍也是不少了，許多的朋友說，你寫的東西爲什麽總有八九成的駡意，是的，我覺得這世界除了駡還有什魔好說？除了駡還有什麽文章？　　就因爲以上種種，五官健全，使我半半百年來只有憂患，無疑的這憂患還會繼長增高，以現下的情勢推來。　　所以我希望成一個殘廢的人。　　成了殘廢的人，其好處眞是多着，不必細舉。　　卽退一萬步講，因爲五官的殘廢，一切的慾望也就會没有了，至少要　退不少。没有衣穿，飯吃，也就拉倒，没有事做，不更愜意！　　總之，在現社會裏，我希望成一個殘廢的人！殘廢的人的好處多着啦！　　丨丨完丨丨憂鬰的姑娘  一蘋　　春天。院子中不知名的紫色花開啦，剪尾的燕子從南國歸來啦，我喉頭發癢！是肺病。　　我等候在電車站口，到作醫生的叔父家去，隔一天。　　對街南貨店中的癩痢小伙計老靠在櫃台横頭，眼瞅着天，在思量什麽街上，車。人，潮一般的來去。斜角空塲上，有浪蕩江湖的賣藝者，鑼鼓喧着，圍着人羣。　　我每次，上車，下車，瞧熟了這些。隔一天。　　我等候在電車站口，到作醫生的叔父家去。例外的隔了一天。　　電車開來，我跳了上去。目光從車廂的這角掃射到那角，一雙熱情的眼睛發現在我面前，一位憂鬰的姑娘。　　跳下電車。一帶新建築的住宅，長綠樹搖着頭，滿幽靜的。　　在懸着醫生銅牌的門前，我按了電鈴。憂鬰的姑娘同時站定了脚，張着熱情的眼睛。　　丨看病的。我想。　　門開了。憂鬰的姑娘注視着脚尖跟進了醫室。　　「遲一天了。」叔父說··他燒着火酒，鋸着玻璃管。　　和我同樣的藥水。　　「ＴoＢo？」我像問着自己。　　没有回答。熱情的眼睛從我面前掃過。　　她没有片刻的停留，飄然的去了。　　「第幾期？」我問叔父。　　「第一期。」妹父燒着火酒，鋸着玻璃管「是你嬸娘的姪女。」他毫無表情的說。　　「我没有遇見過她！」　　「同你上下一天。」　　我等候在電車站口，到作醫生的叔父家去。隔一天。　　對街南貨店的癩痢小伙計老靠在櫃台横頭，眼瞅着天，在思量什麽。車，人，潮一般的來去。斜角空塲上，有浪蕩江湖的賣藝者，鑼鼓喧着，圍着人羣。　　電車開來，我跳了上去。目光從車廂的這角掃射到那角。一雙熱情的眼睛，那位憂鬰的姑娘。　　她低低地微笑，似乎說丨巧啊！　　「我每天這時候去的。」我心中這樣回答。　　沉默着。　　跳下電車，一帶新建築的住宅，長綠樹搖着頭，滿幽靜的。　　在懸着醫生　牌的門前，我　了電鈴。憂鬰的姑娘同時站定脚，張着熱情的眼睛。　　叔父燒着火酒，鋸着玻璃管。毫無表情。　　她没有片刻的停留，飄然的走了。　　我等候在電車站口，到作醫生的叔父家去。隔一天。　　我等候在電車站口，到作醫生的叔父去。隔一天。　　我············　　對街南貨店中的癩痢小伙計老靠在櫃台横頭，眼瞅着天，在思量什麽。車，人，潮一般的來去。斜角空塲上，有浪蕩江湖的賣藝者，鑼鼓喧着，圍着人羣。　　我每次，上車，下車，瞧熟了這些。隔一天。　　電車開來，我跳了上去。目光從車廂的這角掃射到那角，一雙熱情的眼睛，那位憂鬰的姑良。　　微笑。沉默着。　　跳下雪車，一帶新建築的住宅，長綠樹搖着頭，滿幽靜的。　　在懸着醫生銅牌的門前，我按了電鈴。憂鬰的姑娘同時站定脚，張着熱情的眼睛。　　叔父燒着火酒，鋸着玻璃管。毫無表情。　　例外地，她坐着。　　一同出門來。憂鬰的姑娘注視着脚尖，我們等候在電車站口。　　「×先生，」她張着熱情的眼睛「你吐紅？」　　我搖搖頭。　　「最好要靜養。我爸爸說。」　　「我也這樣想。」　　「下星期我要到杭州去。」熱情的眼睛從我面前掃過。　　「我不能離開工作。」　　「我聽姑夫說過。」憂鬰的姑娘注視着脚尖。　　電車來了，我們跳了上去。沉默着。　　春天。院子中不知名的紫色花開啦，剪尾的燕子從南國歸來啦。我喉頭發癢丨是肺病。　　我等候在電車站口，到作醫生的叔父家去。　　對街南貨店中的癩痢小伙計忙着包紥這樣，那樣，門前飄着二十週紀念大减價的鮮紅旗幟。車，人，潮一般的來去。斜角，新造的電影院綠的牆。不見浪蕩江湖的賣藝者，不聞鑼鼓的喧鬧聲丨是音樂，人羣擁了進去。　　電車開來，我跳了上去。目光從車廂的這角掃射到那角，每張陌生的臉，没有熱情的眼睛，没有鬰憂的姑娘。　　跳下電車，新建築的住宅褪了色，長綠樹搖着頭，滿幽靜的。　　在懸着醫生銅牌的門前，我按了電鈴。　　門開了，我走進醫室。那熱情的眼睛，憂鬰的姑娘，在火爐架上。　　叔父燒着火酒，鋸着玻璃管。毫無表情。　　「她怎樣了？」　　「誰？」　　我指着火爐架上的照片。　　「二個月前過世了！」毫無表情的回答。　　「？」　　「本來她的現象比你好。」　　出門來，我注視着自己的脚尖，等候出電車站口。　　丨熱情的眼睛，憂鬰的姑娘。眼前飛過的。現代名人書畫  柯艇字一　福建閩侯人海上石屏仙苑書畫社總幹事雪夜  花　　當我從亭子間出門的時候，因爲所居在白畫是暗無天日，在夜裏又是關窗下帘，不知道外面的世界究竟是怎樣，一上門口的道路，寒風刺骨，迎面雪花撲來，這才能白天在下雪了。　　「踏雪尋梅，」或者是「雪夜訪友」，「乘興而來掃興而回」，這是古之文人的閒情逸緻；我在雪夜中冒雪走路，却毫没有詩意的感覺。我的心理滿溢着一椿事，爲了這一椿事，冷雪寒風對於我的襲擊，肉體完全麻木。走出了弄堂口，寒風呼呼地夾着冷雪迎面撲來，馬路上的路燈昏黄而黯淡，電車從遠的地方隆隆軋軋地飛馳而過，法國公園那裏的樹林隱在黑暗裏，站崗的巡捕在叱喝着黄包車夫，可是我並没有留心着這一切，我將大衣的領子翻轉過來掩齤下朶急急地走。要到的地方距離並不遠，可是我總怨恨者自己的腿兒爲什麽跑得那麽的慢。在那臨街的房子門前按了電鈴，應門的正是我要訪問的主人。　　「下雪了，這樣大冷天，有什麽事」？主人關心地問着。　　這　人是一位儒醫，從三峽九灘的　　「天府之國漫遊到上海，因爲某一年漫游了那「天府之國」曾經病倒受他醫好的緣故，而且談吐，相合成爲朋友，他到了上海便時常往來。主人關心我的寒冷，可是我是忘記了自己在關心着别人的病痛。</p>

<p>揩面之前小紀  烈火　　丨丨雪天有感丨丨　　二三日來，氣溫遽然地轉寒了。　　我總算還紥了一件不三不四的灘皮，昨夜從朋友那裏趕回來，畢竟還是抵擋不住刀刮似的雪風，我的身縮做像一頭屋簷下的狸貓，牙關「斬斬斬」致嚮着，好容易才挨到一丈見方的小室。　　坐上床沿，彷彿連一口窮氣都冷煞了似的，半晌抽不轉氣，接頭吸了兩枝「好樂牌」，才略略蘇活一些，於是自己猛批了兩掌面頰，說··「窮人却長着一具怕冷的富人的身體，是該死的窮人」　　冷什麽呢？看啦··賣手勁賣肩膊力的車夫挑夫，不是單衣赤足任由雪風在襲擊麽？冷什麽呢？完全是生活超出惹來的事！　　然而，眞的早起我却又怕看得報，雪風是這樣的勁厲，說不定四萬萬同胞中會被刮殺幾個，無論怎樣這是痛心的事，也是最不合算的事。　　然而據說下雪又是好的，大雪紛飛是豐年，春夏是不是風調雨順？秋收會不會豐稔盈塲，就看冬雪降不降得多。　　大雪，是豐年的預兆，下雪總是好的。　　但我却又始終懷疑，中國總是一個例外的國家，去年長江流域豐收，却是豐收反成災，這呌我拿什麽話來解釋呢　　與其豐收成災，倒不如··雪呀，你莫下吧！救留幾個現成的國民，雖說是不値錢的國民。　　爲的是··早起我就怕看得報，昨夜的雪風實在刮得太勁厲了！　面之前，先寫下這段小紀。業餘信箱徵婚編輯先生；　　時常見你在報上指導許多迷路的人，因此知道你是黑暗中摸索的人們的燈塔。現在我有一個問題，請你破費點時間。在報上給我一個具體的答覆吧。　　我是一個愚笨而孤零得可憐的　年男子，没有家族，也没有情性相　　朋友。這固由於我的生性落落難合，同時因我的職業，是人們視爲窮措大的小學敎員。所以終年勞瘁於悽凉的情緒之下，没有人來慰問一聲的，因爲我還是一個獨身的男子。在從前我覺得這樣赤條條一個光身，我可以毫無牽累的流浪，並不感到孤寂。但不知什麽緣故，從去年起忽而感到孤單了。不但感到孤單，最近我簡直不願保存我的生命，時時覺得没有家室，没有子女，孤單單的一條光命，用勞力賺錢來養活，實在没有意思。有時我自己安慰自己說··「人生應從大處想··盡力職務，努力學業，未始不是安慰之一法。」可是這只能一時騙過自己。現在學校放假了，同事們歡天喜地的回家了，我呢，不是留在冷落的學校裏，便是租信亭子間。於是我想到結婚。但在新舊交替，實際還是男女隔絕的社會，從什麽地方去物色一個女朋友？我常想在報上徵求一下。然而我知道男女結合，應以友誼進而得愛情，徵得的女友，能否發生情愛？現在請你費神答覆的是··登報徵婚，是否正當？及有無危險？應如何辨别對方『人的品性』？肅此，敬祝　撰安。　　玄青叩上　　×　　×　　×　　×　　編者按··一個人以了相當年齡，就會感覺有結婚的需要，這是很自然的。不過在報上徵婚的辦法，雖不能說牠「不當正」，但我們終以爲多少含些危險性。第一在這種半新不舊的社會裏，來應徵的人，十九會使你失望。第二因爲兩方面都希望結婚的緣故，卽使中間能保持一個友誼關係的時期，决不容你有自由觀察的機會。倘使貿然進行結婚，那末前途只有痛苦的成分，幸福云乎哉。此外應徵的人，以及牠的親友，每每會在試行交際的時候，就誤認爲婚約已成，所以卽使一旦發現對方缺點之後，每每會有無從擺脫之苦。一個人在徵婚的時候，自以爲可以在許多應徵者之中，放出法眼，揀一個稱心如意的配偶；但是一旦鶯鶯燕燕，來了一大羣的時候，鮮有不爲之目迷五色，甚且有好惡倒置者。這雖似乎是一句不合情理的話；但是她與「你以前並不想到結婚，而目下會感到迫切需要」的事實，同其神秘。　　玄青君應當估量自己的一切，在自己平日知道的女子中，選定一個做目標。對她作更進一步的觀察，但求樸質無華，性格高超者爲已足。然後進行求婚手續，比了登報徵求，决計妥當。至於求婚的手續，或採新法，或採舊式，一以兩方的環境爲依歸可也。小說曼麗的自由  曼之曼麗··　　當你接讀我這一封信的時候，你一定先要看看信後署名的是誰。我先告訴你吧，我是人傑的朋友，一個曾經到過你們家裏而双聽過你向他訴說你心中的話的人。　　你應該記得的吧？有一天的下午，丨那是一個天氣和暖的暮春的下午丨人傑上××大學敎課去了，我到你們家裏去找人傑，僕歐引我上樓，剛走到梯盤的時候，你從房裏開門出來問一聲是誰，我就停住脚步在那半暗不明的梯盤下面仰着頭和你對話。　　「他剛去上課，三點鐘凖回家的。」　　「這時才兩點，等以三點？我回去了。」　　「他說今天馬虎一點，兩點半就可以回來，請到客堂裏坐一坐。」　　「兩點半還有半點鐘，呌我坐冷板凳，我不幹，回去。請告訴他，我來了就好。」　　「他說過今天陳先生要來的，他一定要會陳先生，請等一等吧？」　　「我還有事，下回再來，」　　就這機，我轉了身下樓出門走了，丨丨你總應該記得我這一個奇特的客人吧？就在這初次的會面，我深刻地認識你是一個怀格拘謹的人，而且不是一個善於交際的女性。後來，我時常到你們的家廟，有一天，你出門去了，我到你們家裏，你的人傑煩悶苦惱十分，他要喝酒，就呌業歐支買了一瓶冰凍的啤酒和一包五香牛肉乾，我們就大喝特喝起來。你的人傑要喝酒，我那裏知道爲的是因爲他和你吵嘴的緣故？而且，他要買酒請我這一位客人，我又怎麽可以阻止他？我們喝着酒，他一聲不響地喝了一杯又一杯，這自然是反常，可是我並不覺得，我稱讚他近來量洪。他也並不冷笑，他也並不胡說，他更不發牢騷，我那裏知道他是受了刺激而來借酒澆愁的？喝完了酒，時間是兩點半，他提議說看影戲去，那一天正是「大飯店」在巴黎大戲院出演，我也就贊成了。在戲院裏頭，」他也並不「反常」，他合我在批評着「大飯店」的劇本的編製，導演的手腕，以及演員的表情。我們稱讚着嘉寳，我們更嘆賞着里昂巴里摩的技巧的成功，他並不是一個「反常」的人呵！出了戲院，一起到潔而精飯館吃飯去，我們又喝酒，他又是「量洪」地大喝一塲；可是他並没有「反常」，我那裏知道他是心中煩悶，借酒消盡一切的苦惱？出上飯館，他要上回力球塲去，我雖然勸他一陣，說他不應該這樣的頽廢，可是他說是消遣並非頽廢，我又怎好製止他？消遣於人生是必要的，我並非一個道學先生，我怎好反對他去找消遣？可是，我有事不能陪他，我們那晚上就分手了。</p>

<p>電影專刊「性的飢荒」在好萊塢（上）  思灜　　表面上顯露着奢侈淫佚　　骨子裏確又是貞靜非凡　　這是描寫好萊塢生活的一篇文章。它是誇張好萊塢的純潔的，但却言之有理。現在將它譯了出來，信不信由你。　　一羣的歌舞女子在攝影塲上散着步。她們穿着游泳衣。這種玉體畢露的衣服，要是給警察在海邊上看見了，他就要拿出繩尺來量一量，或者還要將她們捉到警察局裏去哩。······在隣近的一個攝影塲的舞臺上，那裏有一個紅髮的明星，在巨型的銀燈下　嫋地走着。臺下的看客一共有五十幾個人，却是些各種各樣的技術人員，像攝影師，燈光匠，工人，演員等等。那個明星穿的衣服，恐怕擺攏起來，還遮不住兩張郵票呢。她在舞臺上，正和一位男配角表演一幕熱烈烯燒的愛情呢······照你們說，這些都是性丨丨整個兒的性。　　其實，不管那裏有多少一絲不掛的美女可以看得到，不管他們有多少熱烈的擁抱接吻，好萊塢却是世界上最缺少性的城市！在舞臺的點綴，在路上樹蔭下的散步，在海邊上的仰臥着逍遙，那當然，好萊塢比一切同等大的城市，還要富有性感。但是好萊塢至終還是閙着性的飢荒的一個社會。　　你們或者聽見過在各位大明性家裏開的大宴會，怎樣的驕奢淫佚和不道德。還有天天報上大字登載的離婚新聞。還有許多裸體女明星的照相，看了可以使你眼珠掉出來的。······實在是很少的，一位電影皇后爲了觀衆娛樂起見，而始終不肯褪去襯衣表演的。不過那些都是好萊塢一角的景緻，亦就是爲公衆銷費而製造的一角。好萊塢各景片公司的利用性感的商業價値，和報紙的轟傳驚人的社會新聞一樣，你們能怪他們或者禁止他們嗎？但是在私人生活上面，好萊塢却是貞潔得比亞林匹克運動塲上操練着的選手還要貞潔　　當然，荒淫的宴會不是没有。戀愛的事情，亦不是没有。但是總計起來，好萊塢的荒淫宴會和欺騙，還不及一個普遍小城市之多哩！你不看見小城市裏，丈夫的半數正在追逐着别人的女人嗎！······原因是什麽，就是要在好萊塢討生活的人，他們都孶孶於自己身體的操練，而不在乎男女的徵逐，因爲身體練好了，才吃得住工作的辛苦，除非他甘心自暴自棄。　　所以你要是初到好萊塢，你的朋友竭誠招待你的時候，你决不可露出色情狂的態度來。他或者問你要女人不要，他告訴你什麽樣子的女人都有······紅頭髮的，金頭髮的，黑頭髮的，色色俱備，一個一個千嬌百媚，任你選擇，你可以回頭他說「不要」。這樣一來，你的朋友就放心了，因爲那些不過是他的客氣，並不是說他一定要替你介紹女朋友也。（未完）影片談評「權勢與榮譽」  逸羣　　PowerandGlory　　丨大上海映丨　　倘使我們承認··戀愛只是人生的一部，並非人生的整個，而整個的人生，是應致力於許多社會的任務，是合理的話，那麽，對於一切任何站在戀愛至上主義的觀點，否定人生，否定一切的宣傳與說敎，都應加以嚴重的批判，便必然地成爲我們的任務。　　福斯公司這一張「權勢與榮譽」，不懂是替戀愛至上主義做了有力的宣傳，而且附帶地，灌注了一些抹煞事實的毒素。　　我們不反對一個人會因失戀而必然的痛苦，也不否認社會上有因失戀而自戕生命的傻子的事實，便描寫了這些事實，而並不加以明確的指示，以而多方面地去發揚光大這種爲失戀而自殺的偉大性，去博取觀衆的同情，這種影響，無論如何，是應在摒棄之列。　　珊萊因匣牛另有新歡而碰車自殺，或者還可以諉之於婦人女子的心腸窄狹，然而在艱苦卓絕造成的「權勢」與「榮譽」的茄牛，居然也爲了新歡又另有了新歡，便認爲「權勢」與「榮譽」隨之而完了，而自戕其生。這不僅說明茄牛忽視了人生的任務，沉溺於戀愛至上的泥坑，而且也充分證明這劇的編製者，不明瞭人生的意義。至少，一個人的「權勢」與「榮譽」，爲了愛而努力，爲了先戀而放棄，總是不該的吧！　　進一步言之，在這片中的所謂「權勢與榮譽」，是什麽呢？很明顯地可以看出··「權勢」只是茄牛能鎭壓鐵路工人的罷工，「榮譽」只是八九位文質彬彬的紳士們在開會時對於茄牛的懾服與尊敬。這一種代表少數人的不合理的「權勢」與「榮譽」，又有何價値可言？　　以上是我們對於「權勢與榮譽」意識上的批判。　　其次關於演出的技術方面，値得我們讚譽的很多。第一，導演者WilliamK，Howard對於這故事的處理，非常得法，他把茄牛一生的事蹟，以及茄牛與亨利一生的友誼，純然用一種叙述的方法，從老了的亨利向其夫人解繹的口吻中，描繪出來。這種手法，固非影壇的創作，但較其他類似的片子，自然而有力得多了。就是關於叙述茄牛的事蹟，前後有許多倒置反覆之處，也並不嫌紊亂，因爲這更足以說明老亨利叙述時之雜亂無章也。而且每一段叙述的畫面的變動時，用一種薄薄的陰影夾區别，更顯示了　他的聰明。第二，關於飾茄　牛的SpencerTracy以及飾亨利的RahphMorgan表演都很不差。可惜匣牛老年時的化裝，因爲面部輪廓與線條的關係，略欠逼眞，否則，當更生色。　　最後，關於攝影，聽說這位攝影師是一個中國人，雖然中國人攝得好影片，並不稀奇，但也不能就此抹煞，在此僅表敬意，因爲他確實不錯！評「晚宴」  凌鶴　　ＤinneratEight　　丨國泰映丨　　據調查，一九三二年的美國電影營業，除了米高梅一家稍有盈餘之外，其他各公司都是賠本。這一悲慘的現象，使製片當局不能不愼重其事，其至於因經濟無把握，不敢規定一九三三年全年的出品程序，而祗能决定半年的程序。在這種情形之下，以許多大明星來從事號召，自然也是掙扎的方法之一種。這對於「晚宴」「凌霄壯志」等影片製作的動機，眞是說得很明白了。　　營業的不振，整個的經濟基礎的動搖，這巨浪衝破了所有的堤防，電影企業也同樣的被波及，這是怎樣値得驚駭的現象啊！　　就因爲這種不幸，使黄金國的製片商乃至於電影藝術家，受着了不可避免的嚴重打擊，而直接的感覺切身的不安。因此，他們覺得這種不幸已是無可諱言了，一切平素認爲醜惡的眞實，也是不可粉飾的而不能不加以注意了。於是「晚宴」便是採取這不幸的眞實爲題材，而作成這憂傷悒鬰的Skelch了。　　輪船公司的老闆，爲了航業不振，不能不設法從英國貴族身上得着巨額的流動金，輪船公司的股東因經濟困難，不能不出賣股票，名優伶不能再從舞台經理那裏得到、八千元一星期的薪金而自殺；······這些，編劇者是無可掩飾的暴露出來了。我以爲，這到底是相當可愛的地方。此外，舞女出身的暴發户的妻子，不願意因丈夫的陰謀而失却她插足於上層社會的機會；輪船公司老闆的小姐盲目的愛上了昔享盛名的優伶，優伶因目空一切，也是看透了一切，而祗得自殺；交際花愛上了一個醫生；這些，都被劇作者當作戲劇的資料而被運用着。所謂虛僞的人生，不過如此。到最後，大家所期望的貴族並没有來，希望掘窑似的在貴族身上得着巨欵而救濟這經濟的危機，終如夢幻般的消失。在這裏，我們似乎可體會到契訶夫的苦笑，重浮起「大飯店」的情調。然而事實上，劇作者對於這社會的一羣，終於盡可能的安慰着，不是麽？暴發户不必心懷奸詐的再事破壞，應當彼此維持，而股東們亦應當勉爲其難，互相諒解，老闆亦得袍病扶持，妻子在一塲痛哭之後，仍須襄理一切，顧全着最後的體面。於是，岌岌可危的輪船公司，又得延長一時。在這含義之下，也許這千瘡百孔的社會，又可安定一時吧？然而這始終是夢幻而已。　　我覺得，關於故事方面，應當　如此理解。　　在這一劇本之中，的確是有戲可做的。其比「凌霄壯志」在演出效果上超越許多，應當歸功於故事的精采。何况有許多一流的大明星努力表演，配角也是優秀的演員，當然，這已經保證了演出的成功。　　因爲故事結構的緊凑，當然不致散漫。更在導演精細而活潑的乎法之下，通順經濟，固然是最顯著的優點，而每一個演員，都有開展他們表演的枝能。約翰巴里摩亞，在僅僅的兩塲戲中，顯出了整個的本領。最顯而易見的是由吃酒以至酒盡的過程，那心是的變化，極細膩的揣摩，眞令人呌絕。琪恩哈羅也是十分細膩的，吃糖，撲粉，塗嘴唇，袒胸，語調的變化，都由於她的表演以說明導演的聰明。華納士皮萊的粗暴，瑵麗特蘭漱的輕鬆，瑪姬愛文的神精質，里昂巴里摩亞的病態，愛德門羅的正直，李屈賽的恢心等等，直至旅館老板的商人面孔，每個都獲得最高的成績。　　當然，這種影片在美國不難於産生，但在中國却不易嘗試這種表情戲了。　　因爲篇幅關係，本文不能過長，而且很簡略，特别是關於導演的介紹及其手法的批判，說得更少，以後當另文補充。南京不日更換新椅　　戲院座椅的重要。已爲先進電影企業家所重視。本埠南京大戲院主人。因鑒於院内座椅，過於破舊。將院内座椅更換一新。以應觀衆所需要。新椅式樣。與素稱上海最優美之裝在大光明樓下座椅要彷彿，然經專家改造。其座身之舒適。坐高之適中。用料之高貴。外表之美觀。較任何座椅。更勝一籌。至新椅色澤點綴。不但與院内各物。毫不抵觸。反而内外呼應。上下連綿。椅面布包絲織花綢，經五六次之改良。歷數月之選擇。方始定局，其佳可想而知。聞現已日夜趕做。不日裝妥云。電影小說歌壇雙絕TheCatandtheFiddle（十）  墨塵　　"Ｈididdlediddle"維克多竭力裝着笑容唱着。突然間他的心停止了跳動了，他的女主角······已經上臺了，現在和他合唱起來了······但是那和他合唱的，不是那老邁龍鍾的老婦人······她是先莉！先莉······她比從前······比他所能記憶的影像······比他所夜夜夢想的······更加美麗了。他將她抱在懷裏······這本來是做戲，但是現在她的頭髮磨擦着他的面龐，她的胸口緊貼著他的胸口，兩顆心共鳴地跳躍著！好像那黝黑的舞臺，已經化成了光明的天堂了。他抱着她跳到那紙做的牛的後面，那是佈景的一部份，於是他們三個······男孩子和女孩子和那隻可笑的牛，一同跳過那舞臺上裝的月亮後面去了。幕亦隨之而下了。　　幕下來的時候，全塲的掌聲和歡呼聲，都要把屋頂轟掉了。在幕後的戲臺角上，維克多拉着先莉的手，但是先莉縮回去了。維克多低聲求着她道··「先莉，寶貝，我有一肚子的話和你說呢」。先莉嘴彎着，冷冷地道··「不用說了」。維克多懇切地哀求道··「從前的事，我是因爲恐怕阻碍你的前途，恐怕於你的幸福成功有妨害······所以不得不離開你。」先莉忽然想着從前維克多所說的話··「我們的事情，早就完了」，一番舊恨又回到她的心頭，於是又想不顧而去了。維克多緊緊地跟着她，一直跟到她的化妝室門前。他苦苦地求着她道··」先莉，你不能不聽我講，我知道你是愛我的。你現在來到此地帮我的忙，就是因爲你愛我，不能忘情於我。」先莉哈哈笑着道··我的所以來以這裏，是因爲我不願意看着一個人送到監　裏去。就是你進監牢，我都不願意坐視不救」！她翩然地走進了化妝室，門立卽螆最起來。　　維克多没有法子，仍舊回到自己的化妝室，那裏道達正在屋子裏等着他呢。道達看見了維克多進來，立卽站了起來，滿面笑容對着維克多道··「維克多，今天的表演着實不差。我特來向你道賀。」維克多兩眼狠狠地瞧着他道··「道達，你聽着，你不能和先莉結婚。她是愛我的。我雖地位低微，不敢那麽想，但她確是愛我的」。「你的話不錯的嗎」？道達擺出疑問的樣子出來。維克多笑着道··「當然不會錯的。她今晚來做我的女主角，就是頂好的證據」。道達很輕視地笑道··「唉，我的可憐的　孩子，你眞當她還愛你喝！你還没有知道，今天　上還是我帶她來的呢！維克多亦答之以相當的一個冷笑。他說「當然我是知道的。你怎麽對於我這樣關切呢······是不是？並且亦很聰明······是不是？没法將我調開了······好讓你自己得以從容布置······是不是？但是你忘記了一椿事情丨就是我比你年輕，她亦年輕，我們是深深相愛的······」道達冷笑着說道··「那恐怕祇有在小歌劇中，才可以看得見一個年輕美貎的女主角，愛上了一個少年美貌的男主角就嫁給他哩。（未完）</p>

<p>The People's Army Does Not Obey Orders; Weng Zhaoyuan Resigns to Cai</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Chen Mingshu and Ji Shen arrived in Quanzhou on the 13th and Zhangzhou on the 14th. They both established People's Government offices, with no intention of closing them for the time being. Cai Tingkai is in Quanzhou. According to a certain source, only Tan Qixiu's entire force was wiped out during this incident of the 19th Route Army. Shen Guanghan and Qu Shounian suffered losses. There are still 50,000 men in total, but the loss of supplies is very heavy. It is now heard that two brigades and two regiments of the Central Army will arrive in Xiamen and land under the cover of warships to attack Zhangzhou. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Chen Gou-shu, Li Jishen, Jiang Guangnai, and Huang Qixiang arrived in Zhangzhou from Quanzhou at 12 noon on the 17th. Some people personally witnessed Chen, Jiang, and Huang. The establishment of the puppet government in Zhangzhou or Longyan will be resolved at the meeting on the evening of the 18th, probably in Longyan. Also, a person from Quanzhou said that Cai Tingkai was in Quanzhou on the 17th and ordered the people's army compiled by Weng Zhaoyuan to concentrate in Quanzhou for training. Weng relayed the order to all units, but none of them obeyed it. Weng had no choice but to resign to Cai. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Public security in Xiamen is gradually stabilizing. There have been no robbery cases since the 16th. The Xiamen Chamber of Commerce has requested the restoration of transportation to Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, but all ports remain closed. Lin Shouchang, commander of the three routes of the Fujian Anti-Rebellion People's Army, went to the provincial capital on the 18th. Xu Rui, commander of the People's Army, will be responsible for the reorganization of the Northern Fujian People's Army within days. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign sources, the remnants of the 19th Route Army have retreated entirely to southern Fujian. Order in the provincial capital has been restored. The foreigners of all countries are safe and sound and have not suffered any losses. British Consul General Bo Shi said that a small detachment of 24 British sailors who landed in Nantai yesterday was withdrawn to warships on the 17th. The British cruiser HMS Berwick, which sailed to Fujian from Hong Kong, was purely to protect overseas Chinese. Now that order in the provincial capital has been restored, the ship has no need to stay for long and left Fuzhou on the 18th. It is heard that after the 19th Route Army retreated and gathered in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, there is a tendency to seize Xiamen. There are many British nationals in the area. If a war breaks out, the lives and property of the overseas Chinese are at stake. The HMS Berwick may sail to Xiamen immediately to prepare to protect the overseas Chinese. This is still unknown.

<p>(Fuzhou) Since the 19th Route Army withdrew from Fuzhou, the city has been very stable. Stores are doing business as usual. The British and American marines withdrew to Mawei last night, and 130 Japanese marines returned to the Japanese warship in Mawei. (Hualian Electric Report from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) British and American sailors in Fuzhou have now all returned to their ships. The city is peaceful and quiet. Approximately two to three thousand government troops have arrived here and are setting off towards Luoxing Pagoda. It is said that they intend to take a boat to land somewhere between Fuzhou and Quanzhou in order to intercept the still intact 19th Route Army. It is said that only the 5th Division of the 19th Army was defeated and disorganized. Xiamen is now feeling worried, fearing that the retreating troops will cause trouble. (Reuters Electric Report from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Everything is peaceful here. However, there is slight unease due to reports from upstream that the retreating 19th Route Army has made contact with the Red Army. This is because the connection between the two armies greatly increases the possibility of attacking Xiamen. The situation in Fuzhou is peaceful, and the British warship HMS Berwick will soon return to Hong Kong. (Reuters Electric Report from the 18th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that since the September 18th Incident, foreign aggression has been rampant, and the nation has lost as many as four provinces. Diplomacy has failed step by step, and politics is becoming increasingly corrupt. There is no denying that the country is as divided as ever. A part of the Central Committee members are indeed planning to propose a plan to reform politics at the Fourth Plenary Session, accommodate opinions from all parties, and implement internal unity within the party in order to save the critical situation. This proposal is purely about matters and has absolutely no personal implications. As for the outside world's claims that a certain department will be reorganized and a certain person will take the stage, it is inevitable to say it too early. As for the issue of Committee Member Hu Hanmin entering Beijing, it will also be decided based on the results of this congress. The report that his daughter Hu Mulan has been sent north is completely inaccurate. The three Central Committee members from Guangdong, Cui Guangxiu, Chen Ce, and Zhang Huichang, left Hong Kong on the Changxing Company's Empress of Canada on the 17th and will arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 19th, or will transfer to Beijing immediately to prepare for attending the plenary session.

<h3 id="e23">The Saar Problem <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>Some say that the current situation in Europe is as bleak as the eve of the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. The crux of the problem still lies in the unsatisfactory relationship between Germany and France. Recently, the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations discussed the Saar problem, which has been widely reported in the newspapers. The so-called Saar problem is a major cause of the long-standing feud between Germany and France.</p>
<p>Let us now trace the cause of this dispute. During the European war, France suffered heavy losses in the Lorraine coal mines. After the Treaty of Versailles was concluded, Germany ceded the rights to the Saar coal mines to France as compensation. The area where the mines are located is to be administered by a government committee established by the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations for a period of 15 years. At the end of the period, a "plebiscite" will be held to decide on one of the following three options: (A) Maintain the current system. (B) Merge with France. (C) Merge with Germany. The above-mentioned) plebiscite. (Will be held in 1935. The exact date of its holding. Will be determined by the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations. The Yuan believes that 1935 is approaching in an instant. It is scheduled to prepare for the vote within days. It officially informed Germany, France and other countries. Invitation to discuss.</p>
<p>Hitler, who holds the political power in Germany, and the National Socialist Party under his leadership, have won the support of the people by opposing the Treaty of Versailles. The rights to the Saar, which were abandoned by the treaty, are willing to be recovered as soon as possible. The Saar also occupies an important position in military, political and economic aspects. More should not be seen as commonplace. This is why there have been repeated demands for unconditional immediate return. Not that. Germany has broken with the League of Nations over the issue of equality in armaments. Now, if for the plebiscite in the Saar, to send personnel to Geneva. On the one hand, it contradicts its withdrawal from the League of Nations. Secondly, it is sufficient to prove that its proposal for unconditional recovery of the Saar is not feasible. It is within our expectation that Hitler will reject the request of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>France's stubborn attitude is no less than Germany's. The Saar used to be French territory and was ceded to Germany by the Treaty of Vienna in 1815. In the following hundred years, Prussian immigrants came in steadily. To date, most of the residents are of German nationality or of German descent. Therefore, even if France has the intention of merging, it knows that it is difficult to achieve its wish. Reluctantly, it is seeking the next best thing, which is to find a way to maintain the status quo. Because for France, maintaining the status quo has two benefits. Directly, coal can continue to be mined. In order to meet the needs of the whole country. Commercial and investment rights can also be preserved without a nod. Indirectly. It can limit Hitler's political power. Do not move the overall situation in Europe because of the Saar problem. The credibility of the League of Nations will not be reduced again as a result. From this point of view, the conflict of interests between Germany and France on the Saar issue is already very obvious. According to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. French persons residing in the Saar at the time of signing the treaty have the right to participate in the plebiscite. The French government then organized the "Saar French Association." Prepared to provide convenience for participating in the vote. All German newspapers and picture albums. It has also been instructed by its political recognition and the National Socialist Party. Spend an hour a day. To do their best to publicize to their Saar compatriots. Although the local government committee has repeatedly cracked down on it. But it cannot be completely stopped. The French public opinion was greatly aroused by this. Urge the government to intervene. And petition to implement a strong policy in the League of Nations. All of this is sufficient to show that the Saar issue has fallen into an extremely rigid situation.</p>
<p>Now, the League of Nations has suddenly adopted a tough attitude. Passing the term of office of the Chairman and members of the Saar Regional Management Committee is indeed beneficial to France's proposal to maintain the status quo. But the German side. The attitude is even more agitated. It has clearly refused to send representatives to attend the meeting. Resolutely express their intention of non-cooperation. This situation. It feels even more precarious. The future of the overall situation in Europe. We are really worried about it.</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the military council wired both Sun and Ma's forces to cease military actions following their contact at Shizuizi, Sun's forces complied and halted their advance. However, after Sun's troops occupied Dengkou, due to the Yellow River freezing over, allowing passage everywhere, a unit of Sun's army suddenly crossed the Yellow River, advancing towards Jinji County in the eastern territory of Ningxia's Oke Banner. Ma Hongbin and Lu Dachang's forces are stationed there, making Sun's troop movement in that direction noteworthy. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Ningxia telegram reports that Ma Hongkui's troops are deployed at Shizuizi to block Sun's advance and plan to reclaim Dengkou, forcing Sun's troops out of the territory. The atmosphere of war still permeates. Additionally, Sun's troops have stopped near Dengkou to await orders, with supplies being purchased in Baotou and transported by automobile. The water has been filled and submerged by Ma Hongkui, causing a shortage of drinking water. (18th Dispatch)</p>

If the military council has a solution for the army, they will obey it. Song Zheyuan telegraphed Qin Dechun today, saying that according to Hu Jiesan's relay of Sun's telegram, Sun indicated that if the authorities had a proper solution for the army, Sun's army would stop its westward advance.

The Central Government plans to order Sun's troops to temporarily return to the Baotou and Wuyuan areas for stationing, and then designate a location for stationing after the severe winter. The Military Affairs Commission has telegraphed He Yingqin to order Sun's troops to comply. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The conflict between Sun and Ma involves military matters and political issues. A concrete handling method can only be decided after Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing and consults with President Wang, and both sides will be notified to follow it. (18th Dispatch, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liang Jingzhen, Director of the Finance Department of Ningxia, visited President Wang on the 18th to report on Sun's westward advance. Wang has telegraphed the Peiping Military Council, ordering Sun's troops to stop their westward advance. (18th Dispatch, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Military Affairs, Sun and Ma's forces are currently still in a standoff at Shizuizi, with no intense fighting.

<p>Our Troops Hold Original Defense Line Without Moving</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese and puppet troops that attacked Longmensuo's Zhao Jia Zhuang on the 16th, after negotiations between the Political Readjustment Council and the Japanese side, both sides telegraphed the front lines to cease military actions. Since the Japanese and puppet troops were only a small unit, they briefly attacked that day, and upon seeing our preparedness, they retreated in the afternoon. Our troops still guard the original defense lines at Longmensuo, Zhao Jia Zhuang, and other places, and the situation has eased. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed Qin regarding the Eastern Chahar incident, stating that under the conditions of not losing rights or humiliating the country, negotiations can be conducted with the Japanese side through the Political Readjustment Council. Shiba went to visit Huang and He this afternoon to report that the Japanese troops at Longmensuo had retreated. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou reports that Li Shouxin's puppet troops stationed in Dolon have repeatedly received telegram orders from the Japanese troops in the Rehe area, designating Guyuan and Baochang as the army's defense areas and ordering the traitorous army to advance immediately. Li replied to the Japanese military headquarters, inquiring about the purpose of the advance, whether it was for combat or disruption, as Guyuan and Baochang were both garrisoned by units under the 29th Army, and an advance would inevitably lead to conflict. The Japanese military headquarters replied to advance according to the situation. However, to avoid losses, Li's troops have not made any progress so far. Viewing this situation, the Japanese military's goal regarding the Eastern Chahar problem has consistently been disruption. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun received a telegram from Zhang Weifan in Zhangjiakou this morning, stating that the Japanese and puppet troops under Mori Ichiro and Zhang HaiPeng attacked Longmensuo on the 16th but did not capture it. They withdrew to Xifengkou on the 17th. The provincial army is strictly guarding the original defense. Yesterday and today have been peaceful. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou reports that Zhang Yunrong, the commander of the Zhangbei garrison, traveled by car from Dushikou to Chicheng on the 17th to discuss Eastern Chahar defense matters with Zhang Renjie, the commander of the 3rd Division stationed in Chicheng, and Deputy Division Commander Song Tielin. Zhang was ordered by Ning to temporarily stay in Chicheng and jointly command the Eastern Chahar military affairs. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou reports that Longmensuo is a crucial pass on the outer Great Wall line, with three small passes, Zhao Jia Ying, Qing Ping Road, and Guo Jia Yaozi, located more than ten li from Longmensuo. These are garrisoned by Hu Wenyu's regiment of Song Tielin's brigade. When the Japanese and puppet troops attacked Zhao Jia Ying, our troops resisted effectively. All major passes and strategic areas have not been occupied and are now heavily fortified with trenches. There have been no incidents of Japanese aircraft bombing or armored vehicles being deployed. The front line is temporarily quiet. Zhang Renjie is still stationed in Chicheng. In addition to ordering Song's brigade to be responsible for defending the territory and awaiting instructions from the authorities, no reinforcements have been sent. Zhang telegraphed on the 18th that after our troops stopped the Japanese and puppet troops' attack on Zhao Jia Ying on the morning of the 16th, there were no movements on the 17th and 18th. Our troops on the front line are working hard to build strong fortifications, making it difficult for the Japanese and puppet troops to succeed. Feng Zhi'an plans to go to Peiping on the 19th to then go to Tianjin to see Song and report on defense matters. Song's back pain has relapsed, and he needs to rest quietly in Tianjin for some time. There is no confirmed date for his return to Chahar. Due to the tense situation in Eastern Chahar, he has ordered Qin Dechun in Peiping to liaise closely with various authorities to handle the situation and has summoned Wang Shijiu, the chief secretary of the 29th Army headquarters, to Tianjin. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Major Takahashi, the Japanese official coming to Peiping from Rehe, is scheduled to go to Tianjin and then Shanghai on the 20th. The Japanese side still advocates that the Eastern Chahar incident should be handled by having each of the Chinese and Japanese sides send one representative to meet in Peiping to seek a settlement. According to related sources, Nishio Yoshiichi, commander of the Japanese 8th Division, will send a staff officer to Peiping immediately to meet with Qin Dechun, director of the Chahar Civil Affairs Department. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that the Japanese army will not cross the Chahar-Rehe border, but in Dolon, they established a special autonomous region government office and appointed Li Shouxin as the commander of the Eastern Chahar garrison. They also occupy Guyuan in the north and invade Chicheng in the south. The Japanese and puppet forces at Xifengkou have not withdrawn. Recently, they have posted notices on the Guyuan-Chahar border, stating that all areas north and east of the Great Wall outside the Great Wall belong to the puppet Manchuria region. Some say that this move by the Japanese and puppets is intended to cause disruption due to the suspension of traffic and to demonstrate power in response to Zhang Xueliang's possible return. Others believe that with the looming Russo-Japanese war, they want to construct a defensive line in the northwest of Rehe as soon as possible, using the pretext of suppressing bandits to occupy the area for a long time.

<p>Puppet Organization to Announce National Policy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Puyi's claim to the throne is a fact created by the Japanese forcing their will upon the people. On the day of his enthronement on March 1st, righteous armies across the country will rise up in revolt. The Japanese and puppets plan to mobilize police from the Jilin, Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin police departments and impose martial law in Changchun for one month starting from February 1st to guard important locations. The Japanese and puppets have agreed on the following security measures: (1) The Japanese army, the Kwantung Agency, the consulate, and the puppet state will simultaneously mobilize troops and police to begin special vigilance from February 1st. (2) 3,000 police will be mobilized to guard Changchun. (3) A special police force will be organized to guard important institutions. The grand ceremony on March 1st will be guarded by the executive's special guards. (4) All unemployed people will be registered and their actions monitored. (5) 1,000 Japanese and puppet police will be mobilized to strictly inspect passengers on the South Manchuria Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway.

<p>(Dalian) Kwantung Army sources report that with Puyi about to usurp the imperial throne, youth in North China and righteous armies across the country plan to assassinate Puyi, rushing to the Eastern Provinces to sabotage important Japanese and puppet institutions. The Japanese and puppets decided today to transfer 2,000 police from various locations to Changchun to guard various institutions. The Kwantung Army dispatched dozens of more military police to tighten inspections of passengers entering and exiting Shanhaiguan, Dalian, Yingkou, and various passes in the Kwantung region. Those whose actions are suspicious will be treated as assassination squads and severely interrogated. (18th China Allied Press)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lieutenant Colonel Takahashi, the newly appointed Japanese military commissioner stationed in Nanjing, arrived here from Rehe by plane. According to an interview with a reporter from a certain newspaper, Puyi's enthronement is not to restore the Great Qing Empire. Puyi does not want to come to Peiping, nor can he come. He is merely the emperor of the new Manchurian Empire. When the reporter asked about the Chahar affair, Takahashi replied that the rumors that Japan plans to expand the territory of [Manchukuo] are purely propaganda. The Japanese military commissioner's office in Peiping issued a statement today, denying that Manchuria would become a second Korea after Puyi's enthronement and stating that the enthronement movement originated in Manchuria. (18th Reuter's)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Reuters learned today that after Puyi's enthronement, in addition to enfeoffing a few close relatives of the Qing family as princes and promoting four barons to dukes, no noble system will be established. According to sources in Changchun, four important declarations regarding the enthronement will be announced on Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. It is heard that Puyi rejected the government's proposal to build a new palace, believing that now is not the time. (18th Reuter's)</p>

<p>Request Maintaining Principles Agreed Upon at Bailing Temple</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Inner Mongolian autonomy petition representatives Nima, Tsol, and Sengelinqin expressed their inability to accept the eleven items of the Inner Mongolian autonomy measures passed by the Central Political Council and decided to discuss the matter at the Dawah Hotel. (1) They will telegraph the Mongol princes regarding the process of petitioning for autonomy in Beijing and the contents of the resolutions of the Central Political Council.

(2) The Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, with its scope limited to undeveloped areas, is inferior to the Mongolian banner areas before the establishment of the Autonomous Region. (3) Of the eleven items passed by the Central Political Council, most of the powers belong to the province, with very little belonging to the Autonomous Region government.

Wang Bin, a special commissioner from the provincial government, was sent to Peiping as a representative. Before leaving, Panchen met with reporters at the Suiyuan Hotel and said that he was eager to enter Tibet, but the date must wait for the Central Government to decide. Tibet is still a religious system, and the Tibetan market must be resolved by promoting politics through religion. The death of the Dalai Lama, with Tibet without a master, is a great loss to the country, and he is also deeply grieved. He has been inspecting various places in Inner Mongolia in recent years, and the results are good. He hopes that the Central Government will realize the regional government of the Inner Mongolian autonomy incident as soon as possible to show its prestige and reassure the Mongolian people. After arriving in Beijing, he still needs to return north and decide to go to the Anti-Jin Banner to chant scriptures. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Discusses Pacific Crisis <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>If Japan and Russia go to War, America Will Surely Help Russia, the More Persistent Will Win</p>
<p>China's Attitude Has Changed and Will Inevitably Stay Out of It</p>
<p>Germany and Japan Withdraw from the League of Nations, Soviet Russia Will Soon Join</p>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies today discussed the Pacific issue. Several deputies spoke of the possibility of conflict in the Far East, making various speculations about future alliances between countries. For example, Chairman Herriot, based on personal impressions, believed that if the Soviet Union went to war with Japan, the United States would surely help the Soviet Union. The war would begin, and the victory would belong to the most persistent. Other left-wing deputies also advocated this view, but with slight differences. Some said that Japan would be isolated, some said that Japan would receive assistance from Germany, and some also recognized that America's recognition of the Soviet Union was a sign of closer ties between the two countries in the event of a Far East crisis. However, right-wing deputies such as Ibanegaray and Fillon Lai held different views. They believed that China's attitude had changed since the Xi'an Incident. If a conflict were to break out in the Far East, China would inevitably stay out of it, and the United States would not risk its navy to reach Japan and China. Socialist deputy Longuet said that the Soviet Union and Germany and Japan were incompatible. With Germany and Japan having withdrawn from the League of Nations, the Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations was even more likely. Today's meeting was only an exchange of opinions and did not adopt any decisions. (17th Havas)</p>

<p>Japan's Militaristic War Is Feared to Be Inevitable</p>
<p>All Countries Are at Risk of Being Drawn In</p>
<p>The Fate of the Pacific Depends on China's Efforts</p>
<p>Milan The Italian People's Daily today published an article by Prime Minister Mussolini discussing the Far East situation. Mussolini said that Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov's speech on December 29 was a warning, indicating the danger of war in the Far East, not only concerning Russia and Japan, but also putting China, the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Italy at direct or indirect risk of being drawn in. He continued by saying that people closely study the position of various countries in the Far East. He dares to say that Japan is currently in a stage of imperialistic development. Japan's land is fertile, the people are strong, and they have always been martial. Their willingness to sacrifice is virtually limitless, and their industrial facilities are no less than those of any other country. Once China is unified and the civil war ends, its future development has great potential. China will inevitably train good soldiers. The future of Far Eastern civilization and the fate of the Pacific depend largely on China's efforts in this century. The agreement between the United States and Russia has a greater spiritual relationship than a practical relationship. This agreement is sufficient to warn Japan, but it cannot be said that if Japan attacks the Soviet Union or continues to invade China, the United States and Russia will fight Japan side by side. Japan is not bound by any international treaties, so it can make its own decisions about war and peace. This all depends on Japan making good choices. Any change in the Far East situation contains incalculable consequences for Asian history. There is no doubt about this. (17th National News Agency)</p>

Its locomotive, seven passenger cars of various classes, and a dining car all overturned. A fire broke out at the time. Four people died on the spot, nine were seriously injured, and thirty were slightly injured. The accident occurred at night, and the tragedy was unusual. Eight Japanese passengers were on board the train. Although there were no attacks at the time of the accident, the overturning of the train was premeditated by the righteous army. The current investigation is ongoing. (18th Japanese Allied News)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The accident in which an international train departing from Harbin overturned near Xiaohaozi in the west on the evening of the 17th was tragic.

After receiving the news, Qiqihar dispatched rescue trains and many doctors to the scene at 10 PM that night, and Harbin dispatched at 11 PM, to take in the seriously and slightly injured.

Last night at 8 PM, the railroad 20 miles west of Harbin was torn up by bandits, causing the engine and five passenger cars of a westbound train to overturn and immediately catch fire. After receiving the news of the accident, Harbin and Qiqihar immediately dispatched ambulances to provide relief. As of this morning, rescue work is still underway. Although there were no British or American guests on the train, there was a German from Tianjin and a French couple from South China. The fate of these people is unknown. (18th Reuter's)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Siberian train was again secretly attacked by bandits and derailed. This time, the casualties were significant.

According to recent intelligence, its national defense status is as follows: Outer Mongolia has 40,000 regular cavalry troops. In Kulun, there are 1,400 Red Army officers, including the commander-in-chief, Colonel Hachiu, serving as instructors. In the western border region, there are 1,200 Red Army instructors, including the commander, Lieutenant Colonel Lozhikila, divided into three lines: The first line extends from Yuesapu to Xixituluya, approximately 300 Japanese li; the second line extends from Geerfubayin to Helunthersi, approximately 200 li, with troops stationed at ten locations; the third line extends from Yagom to Dumusk, approximately 100 li. Yagom has a garrison of 500 troops, with 20 field guns and three tanks, with surrounding fortifications and numerous obstacles. Dumusk has a garrison of 500 troops, with 18 field guns and three tanks. To unify these lines, a main force of over 100,000 troops is concentrated in Shanboluos in the rear, connected to the Kulun command headquarters by a motor road.

<p>Netherlands Note to League of Nations</p>
<h3 id="e42">Uphold Principle of Equality <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Past Failures Due to Infighting Among Major Powers</p>
<p>Willing to Participate in Reconstruction Efforts if Any</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat announced last night the Dutch government's note supporting the reconstruction of the League of Nations. The note, totaling six pages, is carefully worded, stating that the Dutch government is willing to cooperate fully in the League of Nations reconstruction efforts, but that before reconstruction, it should ensure that it contributes to the improvement of the world political situation, as it believes that the current world would be impossible without the League of Nations, and that the current organization of the League of Nations, dating from 1919, has considerable potential for reconstruction. The note further states that the Dutch government deeply feels that when the League of Nations convenes meetings to discuss any matter, it does not harm the League's covenant or the interests of other member states if certain member states hold separate meetings to clarify the issue, as is the case with the disarmament issue. However, rules must be established so that all resolutions made by several member states should be communicated to the League of Nations for the record. Furthermore, the Dutch government has now decided to demand that the principle of equality for League of Nations members be affirmed, as this principle is the foundation of any organization of independent nations. However, the Netherlands recognizes that there are indeed distinctions between large and small countries within the League of Nations organization, and the Netherlands has repeatedly stated that it does not approve of increasing the number of council seats, as the League of Nations has repeatedly increased the number of non-permanent seats, losing its effectiveness. As for the proposal to separate the League of Nations Covenant from the Treaty of Versailles, the Dutch government does not oppose it extremely, but for practical reasons, it believes that such a separation would be better left undone. Finally, the Dutch government stated its willingness to join the work of League of Nations reconstruction, but that all changes should be within the scope of Article 26 of the Covenant.

<p>(Geneva) The German government's reply declining the League of Nations' invitation to send a representative to the Administrative Council was delivered this evening. The reply expresses the German government's regret for its inability to participate in the discussion. Since the Saar Governing Commission announced the activities of the National Socialist Party in the Saar, this issue has attracted attention from all sectors. If the German government agreed to send a representative, it would have to explain the facts of the National Socialist Party's activities. (Seventeenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat announced the memorandum of the Saar Regional Separation Party, which complains about the terrorist acts committed by the National Socialist Party. It is noteworthy that its arguments are identical to the Saar Commission's previous response to the "German Front" memorandum. Although the Separation Party only accounts for a small portion of Saar residents, the Commission's attitude towards their memorandum clearly shows bias. (Seventeenth National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Franco-Russian Relations Become Closer</p>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies met, chaired by former Prime Minister and leader of the Radical Party, Herriot. Herriot reported to the committee on the recently concluded Franco-Russian trade agreement, one clause of which stipulates that the Soviet Russian commercial representative in France may establish offices in several French cities. The committee believes that given this clause, France should also establish several consulates in Russia according to the principle of reciprocity. The committee then exchanged views on various issues related to the Far East, namely the so-called Pacific problem. All issues such as the naval problem between Japan and the United States, the difficulties caused by the establishment of "Manchukuo" by Japan and Russia on land, and the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway were discussed. Deputies Medaille and Frot raised several questions about the Franco-Russian trade agreement. During the discussion of the Pacific problem, Chairman Herriot, the Socialist Longuet, and the right-wing Ibanagary all spoke successively. Finally, Frot proposed the following two motions, which were eventually passed: (1) Franco-German Social Insurance Convention, (2) Supplementary agreement on the implementation of the Social Insurance Convention in the border provinces of Germany and the Saar region.

<p>Vienna Although some incidents occurred when Italian Undersecretary Suvich arrived here, they were not significant. Police dispersed a large group of suspicious people and found several paper bombs. When demonstrators shouted "Long Live Hitler," several people were arrested by the police. (Eighteenth Havas Dispatch) Vienna Italian Foreign Undersecretary Suvich officially met with President Miklas and Chancellor Dollfuss this morning and had a cordial discussion with Dollfuss for an hour. Also, when Suvich traveled from the station to his residence, a large group of National Socialists demonstrated along the way and more than sixty people were arrested. (Eighteenth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vienna Italian Foreign Undersecretary Suvich departed from Rome at 8:00 this morning for Vienna. Suvich's visit is of great significance and quite noteworthy, and the Berlin party cannot take it lightly. The Neue Freie Presse carries a dispatch from Rome stating that the Italian Foreign Ministry insists that Suvich's visit to Austria does not intend to present any plans to the Austrian government regarding the conflict between Germany and Austria. The Neue Wiener Tagblatt reported that Suvich will stay for several days, which is longer than the usual visit time. Italy knows that if Austria is to maintain its independence, it must first be economically viable. Therefore, the talks between Italy and Austria will focus on economic aspects, and the issue of designating the port of Trieste as a free port will also be discussed. (Note that this port belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the war and was assigned to Italy by the peace treaty, after which Austria had no access to the sea.) Local sources also said that Italy supports the basic principles of Austrian policy, as Suvich held talks with the German government in Berlin last year, the circumstances of which seemed to be inconsistent with Italy's wishes, leading to a cool attitude in Italy's policy towards Germany. For this reason, the purpose of Suvich's visit to Austria this time is not to change Austria's policy, but to make the principles on which Austria's policy is based more solid and clearly expressed.

<p>Order from Lower-Level Officials to Be Rescinded</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the authorities issued an order requiring all Austrian nationals in Germany to register with local officials. The Prussian Secret Police immediately announced that it had compiled a list of Austrian nationals and would implement special plans to crack down on them, intending to retaliate for the alleged mistreatment of National Socialists in Austria. Austrian nationals in Saxony and other places were ordered to report their occupation, religion, origin, and the amount of their property to the police station by January 20, and those who violated or made false reports would be deported. Upon receiving this news, the Austrian government immediately telegraphed the Austrian embassy in Berlin to lodge a strong protest with the German government, pointing out that this move violated the Austro-German treaty. After the Austrian ambassador questioned the German Foreign Ministry, German Foreign Minister Neurath immediately explained to the Austrian ambassador that the order was issued by lower-level officials and would be rescinded.

This plan should eliminate inequality and mutual suspicion, and replace them with the principles of equality and sincerity. As it is a comprehensive plan, it must be jointly established by all countries.

<p>Legal Issues of Receiving Gold Reserves</p>
<p>Inevitable Debate in the US Congress</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury officials today do not believe that a currency war is possible between Britain and the United States due to President Roosevelt's monetary policy, saying that the two countries will continue the existing ratio between their currencies. Regarding the issue of the legality of the Treasury Department's receiving gold reserves from the Federal Reserve Banks, debate may now be inevitable. Part of President Roosevelt's faction, led by Senators Glass, McAdoo, and Gore, now opposes this and declared to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau during the Bank Committee's study of the monetary bill that the receipt of Federal Reserve Bank reserves is unconstitutional and confiscatory. When discussing the proposal to authorize the Treasury Department to control credit, some also spoke of the dignity of the gold clauses in contracts, believing that the entire national banking structure would be revolutionized as a result. However, judging from various phenomena, Congress may soon pass the President's monetary bill. (Seventeenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The value of the US dollar was still strong in the foreign exchange market this morning for the following reasons: (1) President Roosevelt's declaration has dispelled fears of a full-scale inflation, so US capital is now gradually flowing back. (2) Those who were shorting the dollar are now continuing to cover their positions because they have made a profit. (3) Foreign debtors to the United States are clearing their debts to the United States while the dollar is cheap. (4) US goods are cheap because of the low value of the dollar, and there are buyers. Unless the US authorities are prepared to buy gold at dollar prices rather than world prices, the demand for dollars will continue. According to the current situation, the United States has not yet provided evidence of buying gold at dollar prices, as most of the gold sold in the open market in London today was purchased by the United States at a price of 131 shillings and sixpence, which is lower than the US price at the current rate. It is still doubtful whether gold withdrawn from the Banque de France and sold to US authorities in the hope of obtaining a profit can be accepted at the US price of $34.45. Although the low price of the dollar temporarily hurts British trade, it is not considered a destabilizing factor in the market. Although France seems to be dealing with it calmly, it is expected that countries using the gold standard will suffer more in the future than they do now. According to London sources, if the Banque de France's cash withdrawals are excessive, France will announce a ban on the export of gold to countries not on the gold standard.

<p>Havana President Hevia has stepped down after only forty-eight hours in office. Nationalist leader Mendieta has succeeded him as president. Leaders of the army and navy, as well as leaders of opposition parties, have all expressed agreement with Mendieta. About 100 political figures met in Mendieta's residence. One of the opposition leaders, Gomez, promised to assist Mendieta, but leaders of the civil servant strike movement still plan to continue the strike until the military dictatorship is abolished. Presidential Palace sources claimed that President Hevia had no choice but to resign because the Nationalists were unwilling to help. Mendieta is scheduled to go to the Presidential Palace this afternoon to take office. Student leaders have announced that university students across the country are opposed to Hevia and Mendieta as presidents and have decided to strike for forty-eight hours in protest. It is generally believed that this expression is the initial reaction of revolutionaries to recent events. Prior to this, Hevia declared that he would never submit his resignation to the Supreme Court but to Army Chief of Staff Batista. Mendieta's succession as president is said to have been recommended by Batista. (Seventeenth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Havana Colonel Batista seized the government and exercised absolute power less than 24 hours after the new President Hevia took office. This is as expected by the public. Batista now hopes to complete the construction of the country and reorganize all departments of the government by rapid means. One of the purposes he announced is to invite talents who formerly supported the Machado government, implement judicial reform, and declare his intention to respect debts and other obligations of the government. He will now embark on the road to creating a new Cuba on the basis of immovable rights and the latest democratic ideas. It is said that Batista was still a sergeant in the army on September 4 of last year and jumped to become commander-in-chief of the Cuban army the next day. Batista has been the mastermind behind the frequent revolutions in Cuba in recent years. (Seventeenth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Havana The coup led by Colonel Batista was triggered by the general strike in Cuba.

When General Menocal led troops against President Machado in 1930, Mendieta actively participated in the rebellion and was arrested, imprisoned, and exiled.

The mine agreed to 28, but the remaining four had committed serious offenses and could not be rehired. The workers were dissatisfied and went on strike, totaling about 4,000 people. It is evident there is a background. Fortunately, after mediation, the mine acknowledged the workers' demands and scheduled to resume work on the morning of the 20th. Whether there will be further complications remains to be seen. (Special dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kaiyuan mine worker representatives Wu Yunshan and others went to the Political Reorganization Committee on the morning of the 18th to petition. Secretary He Jiecai received them on behalf of the committee and promised to forward the miners' requests to Chairman Huang and instruct the Hebei Provincial Government to conduct a thorough investigation. The representatives left immediately and returned to Tianjin at 4 PM to continue petitioning the Provincial Government and the Department of Construction. Chen Fangxian, a member of the Provincial Party Committee, stated that the Kaiyuan mine worker incident was unfortunate. The police authorities' firing of guns and disregard for human life were particularly inappropriate. The incident was purely a reaction to the excessive oppression by the mine. The Party Headquarters has decided to provide assistance and has telegraphed the central government, ordering the Hebei Provincial Government to thoroughly investigate and deal with the matter. It hopes that the mine can change its attitude to avoid escalating the situation. Otherwise, tens of thousands of workers, unable to bear the oppression, will go astray, which is related to the safety of North China. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Finance, since the Yangtze River flood, followed by the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and the suppression of the Jiangxi bandits and Fujian rebellion, the national tax revenue has been greatly affected. While income has decreased, expenditures have increased daily. Despite strenuous efforts to reduce expenditures last year, they were still insufficient. Patriotic public bonds of 20 million yuan, 22-year customs treasury bills of 100 million yuan, and public bonds for relief in the North China war zone of 4 million yuan were successively issued. As of the end of last year, China's total bond issuance reached 1,171,392,228 yuan. After deducting the principal due, the remaining debt was 831,892,632 yuan, returning to the debt status of the Republic of China in 1931. To maintain the government's credit, the current financial authorities have decided to repay the principal and interest on schedule, so that the prices of the bonds are not slightly changed.

<p>=Chen Mingshu Initially Wanted to Fight to the Death=</p>
<p>=Cai Tingkai Strongly Advocated for a Full Retreat=</p>
<p>A communication from Xiamen reports that the Central Army recaptured Xiamen on the 10th and Fuzhou on the 13th. The so-called People's Government was eliminated with the recapture of Fuzhou. When the Fujian forces made their general retreat from Fuzhou, they decided to abolish the People's Government after arriving in Quanzhou, and only use the name of the 19th Route Army to the outside world. The Central Army recaptured Yanping on the 6th, and the 19th Route Army held on for another week. On the afternoon of the 12th, the Central Army recaptured Gutian. Cai Tingkai deployed the final line of defense at Dayu Lake in Baiyu, near Fuzhou, and knew that it could not be defended, so he ordered a general retreat on the evening of the 12th. It is said that before withdrawing, the 19th Route Army sent personnel to contact the Central Army in the Shuikou area of Gutian and the Navy in Mawei, allowing them to retreat to southern Fujian automatically. The Central Army agreed, and the retreat began. Therefore, the Central Army did not pursue the retreating troops at the front line, and the Navy did not intercept them at Xiaduo. Because there were many Japanese residents in Fuzhou who were unwilling to evacuate, the Japanese consul also stated that they would protect themselves and take decisive measures if necessary. On the 11th, they requested both the Central Army and the 19th Route Army not to harm the lives and property of Japanese residents, and four Japanese warships were berthed at Mawei, and three companies of marines with over seven hundred men were also ready to land at any time. The Jinan May 3rd Incident would have played out in Fuzhou. Fortunately, the Central Army allowed the 19th Route Army to withdraw from Fuzhou automatically, there was no war in the suburbs, and the naval landing party entered the city to take over the defense and maintain order after the 19th Route Army withdrew. Thus, a dangerous situation was safely overcome. The troops of the 19th Route Army's final line of defense at Baisha and Dayu Lake and the defeated troops at Gutian Shuikou withdrew from the front line to the suburbs and then transferred to Hongshan Bridge and Xiaduo, both crossing the river. The troops inside the city and those in the Lianjiang area transferred to Xiaduo across the river. The withdrawal took place throughout the 12th night and the 13th, all day. Cai Tingkai flew to Quanzhou on the afternoon of the 13th with Deng Shizeng to arrange the withdrawal of troops. Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, Jiang Guangnai, Huang Qixiang, Chen Youren, and other important officials of the People's Government followed the army. Personnel from various agencies also fled. The organ newspapers of the pseudo-government, the Renmin Ribao and the Guoguang Ribao, stopped publication on the 13th. The Renquan Zaobao was published on the 13th, but by noon, the staff had also dispersed. The retreat of the army was led by Zhang Yan's 4th Army, as they had just been transferred and had not experienced combat, and were still a fresh force. Zhang Yan and Tang Dehuang remained in the city to manage the withdrawal and the handover to the Navy. At 6 PM on the evening of the 13th, a thousand naval marines went to the province from Mawei. Zhang Yan was furious that they were too fast and sent a staff officer named Hu to stop them, requesting that they enter the city after the 19th Route Army had completed its withdrawal, otherwise they would not hesitate to fight. At the same time, the Chamber of Commerce came forward to mediate, and the Marines stayed outside the city temporarily. On the morning of the 14th, the 19th Route Army inside the city completed its withdrawal, leaving only one battalion of military police to maintain order. The Marines entered the city at 8 AM, and the military police followed Zhang Yan and withdrew across the river in the end. As for the Baisha area, the 19th Route Army had completely crossed the river by the evening of the 14th, and the Marines entered the city immediately. Li Mengbin first took over the various agencies, and Chen Jiliang also entered the city in the afternoon, which greatly stabilized the situation. The first company of the Japanese Marines, under the command of Shouya, landed at 7 PM on the 12th and stationed at the Consulate General. At 9 AM on the morning of the 13th, the second company continued to land and stationed at the Japanese Residents Association, a total of five hundred men, machine guns and mountain guns firing later, parading through the city, causing great panic among the people. By the afternoon, the 19th Route Army had voluntarily withdrawn, and there was no unrest in Fuzhou. The commander of the Japanese Marine Corps, Shoji, then issued a statement saying, "The Japanese Marine Corps has landed for a short period to protect the lives and property of residents and will temporarily station at the Consulate General and the Japanese Residents Association. We do not interfere in China's war, so do not misunderstand our Marine Corps." It was impossible to find an excuse, and it was collected without incident. However, it was almost the same as the Jinan May 3rd Incident and Tianjin after the September 18th Incident. From this, it can be seen that the fact that the Central Army did not press hard upstream and that the Mawei Navy did not attack from behind also had its reasons. The safe retreat of the 19th Route Army from the front line and Fuzhou, the above-mentioned casting of rats at the porcelain, was a major reason. Second, Chen Mingshu and the people of the Third Party advocated fighting to the death, but before Shuikou was recaptured, Cai Tingkai was deploying the final line of defense at Dayu Lake and Baisha, planning a counterattack to relieve Gutian in order to save the situation. Unexpectedly, after Shuikou fell, Gutian was cut off from the rear, and the isolated city was like the setting sun, and the situation could not be reversed. Therefore, Cai strongly advocated that if Gutian was lost, the condition for a safe retreat was to return to southern Fujian and preserve most of the strength, and make other plans. Cai's proposal was supported by the entire army. After retreating to the south, the headquarters of the 19th Route Army will be established in Quanzhou, with Yongtai and Fuqing as the front line, firmly defending Xingquan. If the Central Army goes south, they will fight to the death again. However, after arriving in Quanzhou, the People's Government will be abolished, and Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, Chen Youren, Xu Qian, and others will leave automatically. They will seek help from Guangdong by abolishing the People's Government, hoping to preserve some of the strength of the 19th Route Army. Cai Tingkai's attitude this time is too clear, and there is no way to stay. However, the various departments of the 19th Route Army can only be unified by Cai, so his subordinates still support Cai. Without listening to Cai to leave, Zhanglong will be allowed to defend the Cantonese army in the future, and the 19th Route Army will firmly defend the six prefectures of Xingquan to confront the Central Army. This is the news from the 19th Route Army. However, Chen Jitang's attitude towards the 19th Route Army has changed greatly from the previous perfunctory attitude after the Central Army recaptured Fuzhou. He clearly refused Li Zhangda's request for military pay in Guangdong, and dismissed the office of the 19th Route Army in Guangdong. On the one hand, he ordered the divisions of Huang Renhuan and Huang Yanzhen to advance into southern Fujian. Chen Weiyuan was appointed commander of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army's Minnan Garrison to command the three divisions. Chen Weiyuan was the Chief of Staff and Brigade Commander of the 11th Army during the 11th Army era. He was dismissed for disagreeing with Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai. Later, he followed Fang Shengtao and served as the commander of the First Brigade of the Fujian Provincial Defense Army. The 19th Route Army entered Fujian and was appointed commander of the First Security Brigade. Recently, Chen Jitang used it to solve the departure of the 19th Route Army. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether the Cantonese army is coming in good faith. Dai Ji is now in Hong Kong. The Cantonese side recently intended to appoint Dai as the commander of the 19th Route Army. Mao Weishou is one of the backbones of the 19th Route Army and is an old subordinate of Dai. This time, he did not suffer any losses. The division commander and below of Zhang Yan's troops are also old subordinates of Dai. However, Mao Zhang and others in the 19th Route Army are known as the direct line of Chen Mingshu. The intention of the Cantonese army is mostly to reorganize the 19th Route Army and place it under the Cantonese side. Today, the 19th Route Army is under the pressure of the Central Army in front and the strong army of Guangdong in the rear. Xingquanyong is a small place and there is no way to get military pay. It is bound to be reorganized. (15th)</p>

<p>丨The Entire 7th Division of the 19th Route Army Surrendered丨</p>
<p>A communication from Nanchang reports that after the Northern Route Army recaptured Yanping, it contacted the armies that went south from Pucheng and Jian'ou and advanced west from Pingnan. Except for a part of the army that went straight down the Minjiang River to take Minqing to approach Fuzhou, the rest of the army surrounded Gutian in order to cut off the rear of Shen Qu's armies attacking Tainshun and Qingyuan on the Zhejiang border. At that time, generals such as Jiang Dingwen and Zhang Qiazhong were all on the front line supervising the battle, and a certain authority also traveled back and forth from the Pucheng camp to command in the northwest Fujian. The strength of the Central Army was very strong, and the air force's assistance in the operation was also very effective. The 19th Route Army was retreating step by step due to the lack of troops. According to the news released by the camp, the Central Army recovered Minqing on the 10th and Gutian at noon on the 12th. A certain unit in Gutian also reported to the camp that Gutian City had been completely recaptured at noon on the 12th, and the entire 7th Division of the 19th Route Army surrendered. Numerous captured personnel, horses, guns and equipment were still being counted and reported, etc. After the Central Army captured Gutian, the 19th Route Army concentrated along the coastline towards Fuzhou in preparation for retreating to Longyan and Zhangzhou in southern Fujian.

<p>After the Collapse of the 19th Route Army</p>
<h3 id="e83">Willing to Cooperate with the Southwest <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>=Li Deng Bring Conditions to Guangdong=</p>
<p>=Chen Jitang Rejects Their Request=</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: The 19th Route Army has been repeatedly defeated in Fujian and has decided to retreat to Zhangpu. However, the southwest of Fujian is still indefensible, and on one side is the nest of the Jiangxi Communist bandits, and on the other side is the eastern border of Guangdong Province. If the 19th Route Army can no longer hold out, the result will be either forced to surrender to the Communists or break into the border of Guangdong. In order to prevent the defeated soldiers, Guangdong has transferred heavy troops to deploy in the upper reaches of the Dongjiang River, and is preparing to send two divisions to station in the southwest of Fujian, on the one hand to monitor the Jiangxi Communists taking the opportunity to invade western Fujian, and on the other hand to block the 19th Route Army from rushing into Guangdong. The independent Second Brigade Chen Zhang's troops stationed in Xinfeng, southern Jiangxi, have been transferred to Lianping and Heping via Anyuan and Sannan, and will be deployed as a reserve force, which is expected to arrive before the 15th. Once the brigade arrives in Lianping and Heping, the Independent Division Huang Renhuan's troops stationed on the Fujian border and the Fifth Division Li Zhenliang's troops stationed in Xingning will be transferred to the southwest of Fujian Province, which is expected to depart around the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>In the political aspect, the Guangdong authorities previously sent Lin Yizhong to Guilin to negotiate with the Guangxi authorities and urge Li Zongren to return to Guangdong. Lin has now returned to the province and reported to the authorities on his meeting with Li and Bai. Although the content is unknown, judging from outside observations, Guangxi Province is now taking a conservative stance and does not seem willing to participate in the Fujian incident, but is eagerly seeking the unity of Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi. In recent days, Wang Jialie of Guizhou Province will personally visit Nanning to discuss coordination, so Li Zongren has not been able to go to Guangdong for the time being.</p>
<p>After the defeat of the 19th Route Army in Fujian, Cai Tingkai and others sent Li Zhangda and Deng Ruiren to Guangdong to visit important figures in the military, with the task of uniting Guangdong Province for self-consolidation. The conditions put forward were to abolish the People's Government in Fujian Province in order to cooperate with the southwest, but still require Guangdong Province to continue to allocate military expenses to the 19th Route Army, borrow a certain amount of military expenses, and provide assistance in military supplies. After Li and Deng arrived in Guangdong, they carried out activities separately, which was heard by the central government, which immediately sent a telegram to Guangdong to take precautions, and ordered the dissolution of the 19th Route Army's resident office in Guangdong. At 6 p.m. on the 12th, the headquarters ordered the 8th Company of the Military Police to rush to the Huizhou Guild Hall on the South Embankment, confiscating the weapons of more than 100 personnel of the special service team of the rear office of the 19th Route Army, and sent another company of military police to station there. On the morning of the 13th, the 12th Company of the Military Police was sent across the river to the Military Veterans' Training Institute in Henan Province, where all the troops of the 19th Route Army stationed in the institute were disarmed. More than 100 original soldiers of the 19th Route Army were reorganized into various troops by the headquarters. Before the incident, Weng Guiqing and Chen Fuchu, the director and deputy director of the 19th Route Army's resident office in Guangdong, had already left Guangdong.</p>
<p>Li Yangjing, the commander of the Third Army, returned to the province from Dongjiang yesterday to report to Chen Jitang on the situation in Fujian and request instructions on the deployment of Guangdong's borders. Chen immediately convened a meeting at his private residence in Guihua Village, attended by all senior military and political officials of the province. Li Zhangda, the representative of Fujian, also participated. During the meeting, when discussing the issue of dealing with Fujian Province, the authorities planned to send three divisions of troops to station in the southwest of Fujian, dividing defenses in Shanghang, Yongding, Wuping, Shizhong, Pinghe, Kanshi, Lingxiao, Zhao'an and other counties, all under the command of Huang Renhuan, deputy commander of the Second Column, and the political affairs will also follow the previous method of southern Jiangxi, temporarily under the management of military organs. As for the request for financial assistance from Cai Tingkai and others, it is currently difficult to handle because military expenses here are also difficult. In addition, Guangdong Province's confiscation of weapons from the rear office of the 19th Route Army this time is purely for the sake of suppressing rumors, and the Fujian authorities should be asked for understanding. Li Zhangda, finding that this trip was fruitless, has decided to leave Guangdong for Fujian in a day or two. (January 15)</p>

<p>Scattering into Anyang and Neihuang in Northern Henan</p>
<p>Kaifeng dispatch: Since Liu Guitang's rebellion in eastern Chahar, he has traveled south through northern Hebei, dividing his troops into smaller units and fleeing south separately. Hebei and Shandong are completely shrouded in an atmosphere of terror. Recently, they have fled to Henan Province, and alarming reports have been frequently received in Kaifeng. According to reliable information, 600 to 700 remnants of the Liu bandits suddenly arrived at Pengcheng Town and Yuezhenji in Cixian County, Hebei Province, on the 10th, harassing the area and ordering the villages within ten miles nearby to prepare steamed buns and food for supply. Any delay would result in beatings with guns and whips. After the county government received the report, it immediately ordered the local militia and security teams in various districts to go to Chouzhenji to join the local militia to encircle and suppress them. After a day and night of fierce fighting on the 12th, several officers and soldiers were injured, and the bandits fled to the Laomaogou area, which is only a dozen miles away from Guantai, an important town in the northwest of Anyang County, Henan Province. The Third District Commissioner's Office, in addition to requesting the provincial authorities to send troops to block them, also ordered Wang Baoyang, the captain of the 10th Security Team, to lead his team to station at the Zhanghe Estuary in Yuyang Town, the first and third platoons to station at the Fenglezhen Railway Station, and the second platoon to station at the Zhanghe Ferry in Fenglezhen, separately guarding against Shexian, Wu'an and Linxian counties, fearing that the bandits would flee south through the Taihang Mountains, and also actively mobilizing able-bodied men and militia to deploy city defenses to guard against any eventuality. Another group of 600 to 700 people, commanded by Cui Yinjie, who previously killed Peng Qibiao, the chief of staff of the Zhengzhai Pacification Commissioner's Office stationed in Henan, has fled to Huilongji, which belongs to Neihuang. (According to records, Huilongji is jointly administered by Taiming, Linzhang, Anyang, Neihuang, Kaizhou and other counties, and there is a saying that three prefectures, four counties and one prefecture are sandwiched together.) They have the potential to occupy the area between Puyang and Kaizhou.

The committee members appointed by Guangdong include Cui Guangxiu, Guan Suren, Deng Qingyang, and Li Qian. Cui arrived in Shanghai at 4:30 p.m. yesterday on the Empress of Canada of the Changxing Company, together with Central Committee members Zhang Huichang and Chen Ce.

<h3 id="e93">Arriving in Shanghai Together <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Cui Guangxiu, Chen Ce, and Zhang Huichang traveled north from Hong Kong on the President of Canada of the Changxing Company and arrived in Shanghai at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, docking at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. Those who went to welcome them included Yu Ming, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Wen Hongen, director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Mrs. Zhang Huichang, and more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers. Cui, Chen, and Zhang disembarked at around 4:00 p.m., transferred to a small boat of the Changxing Company to cross the river, and landed at the New Customs Wharf at 4:30 p.m., immediately going to their residences to rest.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Cui's Remarks <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>After disembarking, Cui Guangxiu spoke to reporters who visited him, saying that he had brought three proposals, namely (1) the Reform of Internal Affairs Proposal, which was drafted based on the eight-point program in Mr. Hu Zhantang's declaration; (2) the Proposal for Promoting Political Tutelage by District; and (3) the Proposal for Requesting Appropriation of Construction Funds for Zhongshan University. The three proposals were jointly signed by Xiao Focheng, Chen Jitang, Zou Lu, Liu Jiwen, Liu Luyin, Lin Yizhong, Lin Yunhai, Deng Jiayan, Qu Fangpu, Lin Zhimian, Chen Yaoyuan, Guan Suren, Deng Qingyang, Li Qian, and himself, totaling 15 people. The content is only what the proposers can see, and whether it will be approved in the future depends on everyone's opinions. The Southwest does not agree with the Fujian side's proposal. As for how to deal with the aftermath of the Fujian situation in the future, it has not been discussed. Mr. Hu Zhantang has no intention of coming to Beijing at present. Mr. Xiao Focheng's trip to Siam is expected to last at least one month and at most four weeks before returning to Guangdong. If someone from Guangxi Province comes to Beijing to attend, they will bring another proposal. Whether Guan Suren, Deng Qingyang, and Li Qian will come to Beijing to attend has not been decided until he left Hong Kong.</p>

<p>According to Central Committee member Chen Ce, he has no proposals regarding improving the navy. This time, he went abroad for investigation entirely in a private capacity, traveling through the United States, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, and other countries for about seven months. The only feeling he got from this trip was that all countries in Europe and the United States are striving for construction, while we are lagging behind in everything, and the future is really worrying. He met with Zhang Fakui in Europe, who is still studying in England. Zhang's studies in Germany were in the army, but now he is studying sociology and is expected to return to China this year. Chen himself is expected to enter Beijing on the 19th. According to Zhang Huichang, he also has no proposals. The report from Hong Kong that there is a proposal to improve the air force is not true. He will rest in Shanghai and is expected to enter Beijing on the evening of the 19th.</p>

<p>The International Problems Research Association, in view of the fact that newspapers in Europe and the United States often have unfair comments on domestic and foreign issues in China, believes that although this is due to the fact that the editors of these newspapers are not familiar with the situation in the Far East, it is also because the correspondents stationed in China by these newspapers have preconceived notions and report inaccurately, which has led to this situation. Therefore, a tea party was held at the Bank Club at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday (17th) to receive correspondents from foreign newspapers stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e100">List of Attendees <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>

He hoped that the correspondents would often communicate with the association and connect with each other in the future. He also said that if the correspondents have any questions about China's problems that they do not understand or do not want to ask the government, they can ask the association at any time, and it will do its best to investigate and answer them so that there will be no deficiencies in the manuscripts sent by the correspondents to their countries. This is what the association hopes most from you. Then, Liang Shichun was invited to give a speech, briefly describing the situation of contacting people from all walks of life in Europe and the United States recently, saying that all countries feel that news about China is very lacking, and the reports in the newspapers are mostly vague and often have the regret of being untrue. He hoped that the correspondents would pay attention to it. Later, Yang Guangzhen was invited to give a speech. Yang has held positions in the diplomatic field for many years and has been in Europe and the United States for many years. He returned to China not long ago and is in charge of foreign communications at the World News Agency in this port. Yang briefly described the influence he received abroad and the position he currently holds. Finally, the correspondents exchanged views with the members of the association and discussed various issues of China and the world, which was very pleasant for both the host and the guests.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Qingdao passenger ship Pu'an was robbed by pirates outside the Wusong Estuary Snake Tail Mountain North on the 13th of this month on its way from Shanghai to Qingdao, and nine passengers were kidnapped. The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the Pu'an had returned to Shanghai and docked at the Hua Wharf in Pudong. A reporter from this newspaper specially visited the ship for details, which are described as follows:</p>

<p>After the Pu'an vessel was robbed, it immediately sailed back to Shanghai from the waters of Zhao'an Bay. The Navy Department has already instructed Lin Guogeng, the Xiamen Port Commander, to dispatch warships to search for the rescue of passengers and the suppression of pirates. Due to inclement weather en route, the Pu'an vessel anchored outside Wusong Port at 2:10 AM yesterday. It wasn't until 7:30 AM that it sailed into the Huangpu River and docked at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's wharf in Pudong. Liu Hongsheng, the General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, personally went to the ship with Shi Weijun, the head of the General Affairs Section, to inquire with the shipowner and extend condolences to the passengers on board. After returning to the office, Shi Weijun was immediately dispatched to report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. At 9:30 AM, Wen Hongen, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, dispatched Lu Ying, the Captain of the Detective Team, along with Chen Caifu, the foreman, and twelve detectives, along with six policemen from the Water Public Security Bureau, to inspect the ship.

<p>The pirates who robbed the Pu'an vessel numbered only ten. When boarding, two were in cabins, while the other eight were in third-class cabins, carrying pistols that were of the latest type and extremely small in size. At 6:10 PM on the 13th, the leader of the pirates gave the order to take action. First, two bandits emerged from the cabin and dragged the watchman to the bridge. Then, the first mate, Sun Zuoren, and the radio operator, Zhu Shun, were dragged to the bridge. Only on the third attempt were the shipowner and the chief engineer escorted to the bridge. Then, all the crew members were escorted to one place. At this point, the bandit leader forced the shipowner to change the course. The entire ship was under the control of the pirates. After subduing the crew members, the bandits went to the first and second class cabins, drove the sixteen passengers and crew members into one cabin (the recreation room), while the other cabin and third-class passengers were driven into another room. Then they began searching and robbing. At the beginning of the robbery, the bandits fired two shots into the sky.</p>

<p>After intimidating the entire ship's crew and passengers, the pirates used pistols to force the first mate, Sun Zuoren, and the purser, Zou Lun, to hand over thirty boxes of silver being transported on board for various banks, totaling 150,000 yuan. Sun and Zou declared that there was no such large sum of money on board, but the bandit leader said that he had heard from customs declarers that there were thirty boxes of foreign money on the ship. Later, the first mate showed the manifest, stating that there were only thirty boxes of paper money worth more than 300,000 yuan. The bandits still did not believe it and forced the hatch to be opened. Only then did the bandits show great disappointment. They then searched all 102 passengers on board for cash and belongings, and even the crew members' money was looted. In the end, they robbed more than 4,000 yuan in cash, but many clothes and jewelry were taken. The looted items were piled up in the main dining room, and finally, seven or eight suitcases were used to transport these stolen goods.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Shipowner Provides Normal Service <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Among the ten pirates, one was a leader, about forty years old, wearing a Western suit, and handsome. After the crew members were imprisoned, the shipowner and first and second mates told the bandit leader that each person had duties and had to be on duty on time. The bandit leader immediately agreed to the crew members' request and allowed them to take turns to serve. The bandit leader ordered that the order on the ship should not be disrupted, so there was no damage. According to the bandit leader, "We have had no business for half a year. This time we came from Guangdong to Shanghai to do this involuntary thing. We have been in Shanghai for two months and spent more than 5,000 yuan. We heard that the ship was loaded with a large sum of money, so we came to rob it, but we never expected it to be misrepresented like this." He also said, "I have many subordinates, and there are agencies in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Qingdao." The crew members took this opportunity to ask the bandit leader to return all the clothes and money of the crew members that had been robbed. The bandit leader also agreed immediately, ordering all the bandits to return what had been robbed, and not to take anything more.</p>
<h3 id="e113">＝Kidnapping Passengers' Circumstances＝ <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The bandit leader decided to kidnap first and second class passengers since they did not get much cash. They needed to kidnap a total of thirteen men, women and children. At that time, there was a female passenger surnamed Zhou in first class, with four children. The bandit leader wanted to kidnap the mother and her three children, but after the first mate Sun Zuoren and Zou Lun requested, they did not want to kidnap women. As a result, the bandits agreed to release Zhou, but insisted on kidnapping her two children. Zou and Sun knelt down and pleaded again, and the bandits agreed not to kidnap them. There was also a merchant Chen and his son, and the bandits wanted to kidnap them all, but after the crew members pleaded, they changed to kidnap his son. Sun Zhenwu, the Qingdao branch manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was detained for speaking out for the passengers, willing to pay 1,000 yuan per person. The crew members also asked for his release. Finally, nine passengers including Zhu, Chen, Zhang, and Wang in the first and second class cabins were kidnapped, but the crew members were allowed to intercede for the passengers on the Pu'an ship, and they were not tied up with ropes, but confined to a room where they could walk freely and eat.</p>

<p>The bandits spent three days on the ship. They did not rob at night, but only patrolled around the ship. The bandits occupied the main dining room, and the stolen goods were also placed inside. The bandits had to change their clothes dozens of times a day, sometimes in Chinese clothes, sometimes in Western clothes, sometimes wearing glasses, which made people dazzled. The intention of the bandits was to confuse people's recognition, and not to know how many people there were in the end, but in fact there were only ten people. It was even more difficult to grasp every meal. Sometimes they ordered the kitchen to prepare twenty-six servings, sometimes only twenty, and sometimes eighteen. All the brandy on the ship was drunk. The bandits were afraid of being seen by other ships along the way and causing danger. On the 15th, they forced the shipowner to change the yellow color of the smokestack to black, so as to lose its target and be able to sail south directly.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Pirates Fight with Fishing Boats <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the 15th, the Pu'an arrived in the waters of Tongshan Port, near Guanqian Town. The bandit leader ordered the bandits to look for fishing boats along the coast and order them to transport the stolen goods, and piled up more than 200 boxes of cigarettes taken out of the cargo hold on the deck. After breaking the boxes to smoke, they planned to take the rest away. When the ship arrived near Guanqian Town, they saw many fishing boats. The bandits summoned them on the ship, but the fishing boats raced to come. Most of the fishing boats tried to climb up. The bandits yelled to stop them, fearing that people on the fishing boats would also board the ship to rob. So the bandit leader ordered the bandits to shoot at the fishing boats, firing dozens of bullets in a row, and finally dispersing the fishing boats. Finally, they detained a fishing boat and transported the stolen suitcases first, then escorted the nine kidnapped passengers to the fishing boat one by one. The cigarettes on the deck were not transported, and the fishing boat was ordered to open up towards Zhao'an Bay.</p>
<h3 id="e116">One Passenger Dies of Shock <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>After the bandits left, the crew members released the imprisoned passengers, who had been imprisoned for sixty-eight hours. The shipowner organized everything and telegraphed Shanghai to report, turned around and sailed back to Shanghai. Among the third-class passengers on the ship, there was a passenger surnamed Zong, about forty years old, who was going to Qingdao with his brother, from Ningbo. During the robbery, he suffered great shock, and because he had an addiction, and there was no opium available on the ship, he was half addicted and half panicked. When the ship arrived at Wusong, the passenger surnamed Zong had already died. The shipowner reported to the port quarantine office upon entry, and asked the doctor to come to the ship for inspection, and then his accompanying brother collected the body. Zhou, the female passenger in the first class cabin, and her four children, who had been kidnapped and released, were all due to the efforts of the crew members. When they arrived in Shanghai, they expressed their gratitude. Most of the other first and second class passengers went ashore, and their families came to pick them up. In addition, the third-class passengers were still on the ship because they lost all their money and clothes. They will still take the original Pu'an vessel to Qingdao tomorrow.</p>

<p>Shipowner Rex and purser Zou Lun submitted a detailed report on the robbery of the Pu'an vessel yesterday after the ship arrived in Shanghai, which has been delivered to the General Manager and the Shipping Department. The Shipping Department then forwarded it to the Navigation Administration Bureau. Liu Hongsheng also submitted it to the Board of Directors and the Ministry of Communications. According to the promulgated Maritime Law, the bureau considered that the shipowner was not responsible for the passengers' losses in the pirate robbery when the resistance was beyond human power. However, the passengers on board will be provided with meals as usual until they reach Qingdao. The navy and local military police are requested to rescue the nine kidnapped passengers.</p>

<p>After the Pu'an vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday, it was ordered to add coal, fuel, and food, etc. It is still scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Qingdao at 9:30 AM tomorrow. This time, the Pu'an encountered pirates, including the round trip at sea, and staying in Shanghai, which was delayed for a week.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Hong Kong Station Negotiation Completed <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, it rained and snowed, and all lines were suspended.</p>
<p>The test flight southwest plane still has not left Vietnam yesterday.</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency said that Huang Baoxian, the director of the business group of China Aviation Company, and Nie Kaiyi, the Chinese director of the aircraft navigation group, took the No. 11 plane from Hankou in late December last year to test fly the southwest route. After arriving in Guangzhou on December 30, Nie Kaiyi continued to depart for the test flight, while Huang Baoxian stayed in Guangdong to handle the Shanghai-Guangdong line and the establishment of a station in Hong Kong. He had repeatedly contacted the Hong Kong government and had completed it. Huang was originally scheduled to take the northbound plane on the Shanghai-Guangdong line back to Shanghai yesterday, but yesterday there was rain and snow in this port, which was not suitable for flying. Although the climate in Guangdong and Hong Kong is not known for sure, the company has not telegraphed the start of the northbound flight.</p>
<p>All lines were suspended yesterday because yesterday was the Shanghai-Beijing line northbound and the Shanghai-Hankou section eastbound and westbound shifts. Because of rain and snow, it was difficult to fly, so they did not take off. All air mail from all over the country could not be sent. If the snow clears up this morning, it will continue to fly.</p>
<p>Xuzhou is still in Vietnam to test fly the southwest route after the Xuzhou plane flew, it mistakenly entered Vietnam due to fog and was detained. After negotiation and release, Nie Kaiyi and An Lisen have gone to Lang Son from Hanoi to wait for the weather report from Kunming before flying to Yunnan. At first, it was said that it would fly out yesterday, but as of 5:00 PM yesterday, this port's German company had not received Nie An's telegram that it had flown out. It is estimated that it is still in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Mortgaging to the Bank Still Requires Further Discussion</p>
<p>Commercial Shares of 500,000 are Currently Being Raised</p>
<p>In order to expand the state-owned fishery, the Ministry of Industry has decided to set up a large-scale fish market in Shanghai. The entire plan and budget have been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the articles of association for the preparatory committee are being drafted. It is reported that the construction cost is now planned to be 1 million yuan. The government will first allocate 500,000 yuan to prepare for construction and purchase fishing vessels, etc. 500,000 yuan is planned to be raised from all parties, and it is currently in active progress. As for the location of the fish market, it has been found at Donggou, opposite Yangshupu, the reclaimed land filled by the Dredging Bureau, about 50 mu. The Ministry of Industry once contacted Song Ziliang, the director of the bureau, because the total land price was about 450,000 yuan, which was considered too large and difficult to raise in a short time, so it planned to temporarily mortgage it to the banking industry. According to the reporter of Xinxin News Agency, the Dredging Bureau expressed its approval in principle for the Ministry of Industry to lease the beach land in Donggou, but the issue of temporarily mortgaging the land to the bank still requires further discussion. It is heard that the Ministry of Industry will contact Song again to make a decision as soon as possible so that construction can begin on schedule.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Heavy Snow in this Port Yesterday <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Rice Industry Stopped Measuring and the Market was Deserted</p>
<p>Cargo Ships Congested in the Suzhou River</p>
<p>Since the new year, the weather in this port has been severely cold, with three snowfalls one after another, but the snowfalls have not been heavy. At dawn yesterday, the weather changed, and suddenly dark clouds were densely covered. At first, snowflakes were flying, and then heavy snow was flying. By noon, the nearby suburbs were covered with snow of about an inch. Looking from a high place, it was like a world of silver. However, in the afternoon, it turned to rain and snow, so the snow melted as it fell. It did not stop until the evening. According to the old farmers, the rural fields are very eager for snow. Since the new year, there have been four snowfalls, but this time is the heaviest. I think with this auspicious snow, the harvest in the spring should be rich. At the rice industry wharves on both sides of Xinzhapu Bridge, Guangfu Road, North City, a large number of rice boats have arrived recently, totaling about 100 ships. Yesterday, because of the snowfall, all the rice shops did not open to measure, and the area was usually unusually lively, but yesterday there were few pedestrians. The boatmen covered the reed sheds and hibernated in the boats to avoid the cold. The rice shops only had one or two apprentices guarding the shops, which was no different from the abandoned New Year's Day. In the Suzhou River, the waterway for ships is often congested. Yesterday, because it was snowing,</p>

<h3 id="e128">Xu Shuzhen's Tears of Blood <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Her Father, the Magistrate of Tongliao County, Died for the Country</p>
<p>Now Mother and Daughter are Destitute, Crying for Relief</p>
<p>Letter to the China Relief Association</p>
<p>Xu Hanchen from Maqiao Town took his family to Fengyuan because he was an official in the eastern province. During the January 28 Incident, Hanchen happened to be the magistrate of Tongliao County. With the responsibility of protecting the people, he joined the first brigade of the 16th Route of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army as the brigade leader, fought bravely, and finally died on the battlefield. He left behind his wife, Chen, 46 years old, his daughter, Shuzhen, 21 years old, and his youngest daughter, Youzhen, 17 years old. Yesterday, his daughter, Shuzhen, wrote a letter to the China Relief Association. The original letter is recorded as follows: (Salutation omitted) I am crying because the national situation is not good, foreign aggression is frequent, and the Japanese bandits are rampant. The people of China are displaced. Unfortunately, my ancestors were officials in the eastern province and took their families to Fengyuan. During the September 18 Incident, they suffered the tragedy of losing their families and dying for the country. At that time, I was a teacher at the girls' high school, and my younger sister was studying at the school. My mother was with my father at his office in Tongliao County, so they were spared the disaster. Not long after, Tongliao also fell. My father sent my mother and daughter to Xixiang with the responsibility of protecting the people, and then joined the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. Because of his brave fighting, he died on the battlefield. When the bad news came, my mother and daughter were frightened and at a loss. Fortunately, we met the rescue team going to righteousness and were rescued, and we were able to flee to the pass. Recently, because of the peace agreement, all the refugees have returned to their hometowns, but my mother and daughter have no place to go, and we are starving and freezing. We are on the verge of death. Who will grieve for the lost people in the world? It is difficult to find the food of the wandering mother when begging on the river. I don't know where my hometown is, and I don't know where my life will depend on. In this unfamiliar place, we will be tied up and wait for death. It is painful to say and think. After thinking twice, there is no way to do it. In the face of danger, we have to call out shamelessly, and we always know that you are kind and generous, and you are happy to do good deeds. Therefore, we are bold enough to ask for your pity, the family died for the country, and the orphans are dependent on no one. Please show mercy and provide relief. When writing, I am in tears. I am so reluctant. I am respectful, Yun, Disastrous Student Xu Shuzhen, weeps and kowtows with her mother and sister,</p>
<p>All the empty ships for selling passengers and goods did not set off, and the incoming cargo ships, such as coal, timber, bricks, tiles, and vegetables, also rushed to arrive because it was snowing, resulting in the river being doubled and congested like ants, with no less than 3,000 ships, blocking the water. It is also heard that a large number of rice boats are parked halfway and have not been able to reach the wharf. It is now known that the water police and others are engaged in dredging.</p>
<p>Various Shipping Companies</p>
<h3 id="e129">Conducting Anti-Theft Equipment Installation <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Xin Jiangtian Also Added Escort Police Yesterday</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies received the regulations on anti-theft and escort promulgated by the Executive Yuan, they have been conducting equipment in accordance with the regulations. Because the Pu'an vessel was robbed by pirates, the Xin Jiangtian steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company temporarily added four escort police yesterday to prevent and guard against it. As for the pirates who robbed the Pu'an vessel, the famous Dapeng Bay bandits, when they came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, the Shanghai shipping companies had received a secret report in advance. When the South China class vessels arrived in Shanghai, they were thoroughly investigated, but the results were not obtained. Now that the Pu'an case has occurred, all shipping companies are shocked.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Yesterday Summoned Rice Industry Groups for Questioning <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>＝Rice Boats from Various Regions Blocked by Snow, Unable to Reach Shanghai＝</p>
<p>＝Those That Arrived Also Temporarily Suspended Unloading Due to Snow＝ Disputes between shoulder-carrying porters and rice carters in the northern Shanghai rice industry, after being summoned for questioning by the Social Affairs Bureau, were further complicated yesterday as rice boats stopped coming to Shanghai due to the snow, and unloading was suspended for those that had arrived. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Investigation</p>
<p>Party and government agencies, considering rice a matter of people's livelihood, sincerely feared that labor disputes would cause social panic. Therefore, the city party headquarters yesterday specially dispatched Lu Yin-chu, an officer of the civil training section, to investigate. The Shanghai branch of the Seamen's Union, because the dockworkers in that district had requested it to stop the dispute, also sent Secretary Si Shi-jian to various rice shops along the Suzhou River north of the Xin Zha Bridge Wu Zhen Road bridge to investigate the details, in order to mediate.</p>
<p>Authorities Interrogation</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau, fearing that the shoulder-carrying porters would obstruct operations again, leading to the suspension of the rice industry and indirectly endangering social security, specially summoned Jiang Shi-zhi, the executive director of the Shanghai Northern Rice Transportation Industry Association, and Jiang Zi-sheng, the executive director of the Doumi Industry Shanghai Northern Office, and two others to the bureau for questioning. Wang Gang, a member of the Third Section, and Zhou Ming-gang, a member of the Fourth Section, repeatedly questioned them and decided to find a solution in the near future.</p>
<p>Porters Expressed</p>
<p>As for the more than 300 shoulder-carrying porters of the Hongtai Yuji Shoulder Transportation Company, after petitioning the rice industry groups and the Social Affairs Bureau without success, the person in charge of the company said yesterday that the workers would temporarily stop petitioning any agency and quietly await the authorities' solution. If it became absolutely necessary, the workers, for the sake of their livelihoods, would disregard everything and act arbitrarily. Therefore, they sincerely hoped that the authorities could find a way to resettle them as soon as possible to avoid prolonged disputes.</p>
<p>Unloading Suspended Due to Snow</p>
<p>The rice in Shanghai is mostly supplied by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, especially Wuxi and Pingwang. Yesterday, due to heavy snowfall in Shanghai, rice shipments from various places to Shanghai were blocked by snow along the way and could not proceed. Those that had arrived also suspended loading and unloading. It was also rumored that the northern Shanghai rice industry and Hongtai Company had directly negotiated and could be resolved soon, but related groups denied this after inquiry. Confirmation is still pending.</p>
<p>Workers at Xiang Sheng Ironworks Demand Renewal of Contract Terms</p>
<p>The factory side has delayed fulfilling the signing of the renewal.</p>
<p>Public sentiment is indignant, and a request is made to the Party and government to intervene. The Xiang Sheng Ironworks in the Muddy Ferry area of Pudong employs more than 700 workers. Recently, disputes have arisen over the terms of labor-management treatment. The Fifth District Shipbuilding Workers' Union yesterday submitted a request to the Party and government agencies for assistance. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiations Reached Agreement</p>
<p>The Fifth District Shipbuilding Industry Union, because the treatment terms of the workers at the affiliated Xiang Sheng Ironworks had expired, had submitted a request to the Party and government agencies in November of last year to send personnel to join the union representatives Zhang Linhua and others to the office of the factory manager on Broadway Road to discuss renewal methods, so that both parties could comply. As a result of the negotiations, the factory stated that business was slack, and except for the issue of salary increases, which would be discussed later, all other conditions would be renewed for one year. However, the formal procedures have not yet been completed.</p>
<p>Delayed in Fulfilling</p>
<p>After the renewal terms and methods were agreed upon by both parties, the Fifth District Shipbuilding Union immediately convened a membership meeting to discuss them. Everyone felt that the recent sluggish business was also a fact. Regarding salary increases, they would be raised when business picked up. All other articles were unanimously approved and would remain in effect for one year. Unexpectedly, the factory has been unilaterally delaying recently. After sending personnel to negotiate several times, they were ignored, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the workers, who have asked the Fifth District Shipbuilding Union to immediately convene a meeting to discuss effective responses, in order to prompt the factory to wake up.</p>
<p>Request to Intervene</p>
<p>The union, fearing that the workers' public sentiment would be indignant and could cause a labor strike that would be difficult to stop, yesterday specially submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate in order to quell the dispute. The original submission reads as follows:</p>
<p>"It is submitted to request the dispatch of personnel to negotiate and sign a renewal contract, so that both parties can abide by it. The labor-management treatment conditions previously agreed upon between our union and the factory have expired, and the situation has been reported. We were also grateful for the dispatch of personnel to negotiate. Subsequently, our union sent personnel to negotiate with the factory, which agreed to follow the original conditions. Except for Article 4, which would be discussed when business picked up slightly, all other articles would remain in effect for one year. Our union then submitted the matter for discussion at the Fifth Representative Congress of the Second Session. Everyone said that since the factory agreed to discuss Article 4 later, all other articles continuing for one year should be accepted temporarily, and everyone approved. Our union complied with the resolution and urged the factory to sign the renewal contract, but the factory has deliberately delayed for a year, and it is still empty talk. In order to stabilize the will of the workers, our union has prepared a document requesting your review and approval, and to quickly dispatch personnel to negotiate with the factory, ordering the factory to renew and sign as soon as possible all the articles other than the agreed Article 4, so that they can be credible."</p>
<p>Soviet Grain Dumping in China</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to China for Investigation</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the success of the first five-year plan in the Soviet Union, the national production of raw silk has increased sharply, especially agricultural products. Therefore, the supply exceeds demand, and it is necessary to export them. Therefore, the annual export volume is very large, but the amount sold to China is still very small. Since the restoration of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations, Russian goods have been actively dumped in China, especially Russian wheat. Therefore, in the past six months, the dumping of Soviet grain in North China has gradually increased. According to news from the local grain industry, in order to develop grain sales in the Yangtze River area, Russia has dispatched Deville Korf, the manager of the Harbin branch of the Russian Eksportkhleb grain company, to Shanghai to investigate the grain transportation and sales situation in China and to promote wheat to local flour companies, bringing seven samples. It is heard that many flour companies in the local area have ordered Russian wheat recently, which will not only have a great impact on our country's agricultural products, but also affect the sales of American wheat purchased by the government with loans from the United States.</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau Requesting Not to Arbitrarily Increase License Fees</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol License Collection Office and the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Branch Bureau, which stated:</p>
<p>"We are writing to inform you that on the 16th of this month, the Shanghai Fenjiu Industry Association submitted a letter stating that on December 11, 22, the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol License Collection Office approved the issuance of a letter from the Jiangsu Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Branch Bureau, which stated that Shangbao is vast, the number of villages and towns is densely packed, and the population is the highest of all counties. The consumption of tobacco and alcohol is very large. If it can be seriously reorganized and licenses are issued in accordance with the regulations, the number of receipts will be considerable. It is now found that the director has been in office for half a year, and the tax payment has not been improved day by day. The handling is very inadequate. At this time, the treasury is empty, and all taxes should be thoroughly reorganized to meet the orders. It is hereby ordered that the director immediately follow the established regulations, speed up the work, and do not delay, lest it be inconvenient, and so on. According to this, it is found that there are many tobacco and alcohol merchants in Shangbao County who have not complied with the regulations and paid taxes according to the level of the license they should obtain. According to the above, it should be strictly complied with to respect the orders. In addition to selecting committee members to conduct on-site inspections to facilitate reorganization, we have sent a letter to inform your association members to be informed. From the spring of the Republic of China in the 23rd year, they must comply with the regulations and pay the license fees according to the level, and do not use any excuse to push back, to respect the national tax, and so on.</p>
<p>"The above was approved, and the members were immediately informed. A small number of members prepared the fees according to the original amount and went to the office to obtain the licenses. However, the office claimed that the amount must be doubled before the licenses could be issued. Most of the other members were surprised to hear this, and they all said that in the 21st year, because of the increased level of licenses, the matter was delayed for a long time. After the association repeatedly mediated, it persuaded the members to reluctantly increase by 30%. In a blink of an eye, there is this move again, which is difficult to allow. Moreover, in recent years, all industries have been in decline, and all industries in Shanghai have reported recession. In particular, the fellow members of the liquor industry are extremely distressed. Not only is there no small profit to be obtained, but even daily life is difficult. We sincerely request you to forward our request to the authorities to take into account the difficulties of merchants, exempt the increase in level, and pay the original amount of fees to the association. It is estimated that 249 households, including Yong Shunxing, etc., total 556 yuan, plus an additional 30% of 162 yuan, totaling 718 yuan. We immediately negotiated with the office based on the facts, but no permission was granted. Later, on the 11th of this month, we convened a joint meeting of members, and added persuasion. In every word, they only described the suffering. After detailed analysis of the original text, Shangbao is vast, the number of villages and towns is densely packed, and the population is the highest of all counties. The consumption of tobacco and alcohol is very large. If it can be seriously reorganized and licenses are issued in accordance with the regulations, the number of receipts will be considerable. It will definitely increase revenue, which is to say that the investigation is not true, or there are omissions in the issuance of licenses. It does not instruct those who have been investigated and issued licenses in accordance with the regulations to be subjected to double taxation. The office does not wash away the sound of its own defense, but wants to increase the extortion of double the harsh taxes from our fellow members who are dying of agony. It is unfair, and the public sentiment is indignant and does not allow the increase in level. The association went to negotiate based on the facts, but there was no result.</p>
<p>"We believe that your association can take into account the difficulties of merchants and will be able to argue on the basis of reason against this act of exploiting our small merchants. We have prepared a list of the members of our association and the license fees, and submitted them to your association, requesting that you negotiate and implement them. We have also enclosed a list of the members of the tobacco and alcohol license levels, and the fee of 718 yuan has been paid to the association. Based on this, it is found that the collection of tobacco and alcohol license fees according to the level is fixed. The so-called thorough reorganization by the bureau is only to instruct the collection personnel not to conceal anything. Now, the liquor merchants who have been issued licenses in accordance with the original amount have arbitrarily increased by double the amount. How can small liquor merchants bear this? The fact that the fees are paid by our association in the hope of negotiation shows the degree of persecution and suffering. In addition to temporarily saving the list of fees, we are sending a letter to inform you of the facts, hoping that you will investigate and order the collection office to collect fees according to the level and not increase them arbitrarily. Thank you very much."</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Again Requests Correction of Taxed Tobacco in Fujian Province</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a letter to the Ministry of Finance, which stated:</p>
<p>"It is submitted for the purpose of requesting. On the 17th of this month, we received a letter from the Tobacco and Silk Industry Association, which stated that the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau of the Taxation Administration collected special taxes on tobacco from Fujian to Suzhou in accordance with the non-special tax area method, which violated the regulations. We submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to stop it, and received a Ministry of Finance approval No. 407, which stated that the order in Fujian Province is chaotic and the special tax on local tobacco leaves has not yet been complied with. It is even more difficult to implement after the political change. All local tobacco leaves in the province and the tobacco made from them should be taxed in accordance with the non-special tax area method when transported to other six special tax provinces. This has been stipulated by the Ministry and ordered to be followed. The previous method of supplementary tax refunds for Yongding tobacco is no longer applicable, and so on. After reading it, we were shocked. It is found that the new special tax regulations promulgated by the Ministry originally stipulated that Fujian was a special tax area. Now it has suddenly been changed to a non-special tax area. Not only is the order changing from morning to night, and the government is contradicting itself, it is a loss of government credibility and gives people a reason to criticize. Even according to the principles of law, facts, national tax and business conditions, there are many inconsistencies. We venture to reiterate to the Ministry of Finance:</p>
<p>"(1) Law and reason: According to regulations, once a charter is announced, it has the same effect as law. After that, unless it is amended or repealed according to law, neither the government nor the people should seek convenience and change it without authorization. Now, the Ministry of Finance only uses an ordinary order to change Fujian to a non-special tax area, changing the Temporary Regulations for the Collection of Special Taxes on Local Tobacco Leaves, which has been announced and not yet amended or repealed, which seems illegal. (2) Facts: The Ministry of Finance changed Fujian to a non-special tax area, citing the failure to hold special taxes. It does not know that special taxes have been complied with in Zhangzhou, Xiamen and other places, and are still collected after the Fujian change. Our association sells local tobacco in Fujian, which passes through Zhangzhou and Xiamen to enter Jiangsu Province, and still needs to pay the special tax there. The charter was promulgated by your Ministry, and the tax certificate was printed and issued by the Ministry of Finance (the tax certificate is attached), and the facts are all there. How can we falsely claim that Fujian has not held special taxes, and even more falsely claim that it is more difficult to implement special taxes after the Fujian change? This is inconsistent with the facts. Even if the tax payment is intercepted by the local authorities during the turmoil and cannot be returned to the central government, the central government cannot fully protect the three major aspects of the people's political affairs in that place. How can it be taxed by another name because of the lost tax revenue, and instead seek compensation from the merchants? (3) National tax: The purpose of the Ministry of Finance in changing Fujian to a non-special tax area is nothing more than to increase tax revenue, so it does not hesitate to violate the regulations and seek it by risking injustice. If it can increase a huge amount of income, it will not live up to the hard work of seeking wealth for the country. If there is no Fujian local tobacco, it is only produced in Yongding County, a kind of silk tobacco, which is very small. Since the frequent red disaster in western Fujian in recent years, the output has decreased sharply. The popularity of cigarettes in various provinces has fallen sharply. During the autumn of the dying silk tobacco industry, how much can the tax increase be? (Please refer to the tax revenue of Fujian silk tobacco in recent years to know the outline, and now it is getting worse.) Is it worth making a fuss about? Moreover, after Fujian is a non-special tax area, when tobacco leaves and the tobacco made from them, which have been paid special taxes in other six special tax provinces, are sold to Fujian Province, the central government must refund half of the tax. The types and quantities may be more than Fujian silk tobacco. Even if they can be offset, or the comparison can slightly increase income, it will not help the national treasury. As for the stupidity of our association, we believe that this order from the Ministry to change Fujian to a special tax area is not related to the national tax. If there are other uses, it is unpredictable. (4) Business conditions: At present, the Yongding area, the place of origin of silk tobacco, still collects the old tobacco and alcohol tax. Because the method of supplementary tax refunds has been cancelled, the silk tobacco is subject to the old system of production tax in Yongding, transported through Zhangzhou and Xiamen, and then subject to special taxes. Because Fujian has been changed to a non-special tax area, it must be subject to special taxes again when transported to Jiangsu. Within the same special tax area, the actual tobacco tax is as many as three times. The merchants cannot bear the pain. Your Ministry is holding special taxes, originally to call for one tax for one item. As a result, it has formed a multi-tax system. Although it is not the initial intention of the Ministry of Finance, if Fujian is not necessarily a non-special area and the method of supplementary tax refunds is cancelled, how can there be such a harsh accumulation? This is not to take into account the difficulties of merchants and comfort the business conditions.</p>
<p>"In short, changing Fujian to a non-special tax area is not an appropriate method at all. We should request your association to forward our request to the Ministry of Finance to issue an order to cancel it and continue to follow the regulations. The Fujian change is a temporary local dispute. The charter has the long-term nature of seven provinces. It cannot be based on this. At present, the central government's military campaign to suppress Fujian is progressing day by day and will soon be pacified. It is not difficult to fully implement the special tax in the province. Our association believes that the method of Fujian as a non-special tax area violates the regulations, disregards the facts, and is not beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The public opinion is in an uproar, and they are forced to continue to request forwarding.</p>
<p>"We have received an order stating that this matter was forwarded to your Ministry on December 22 of last year, and on the 16th of this month, we received an approval No. 459, which has been forwarded to the association. Now, according to the association's continued letter, those who still collect fees in accordance with the old tobacco and alcohol tax are only in Yongding. In Zhangzhou, Xiamen and other places, special taxes have been established and collected in accordance with the regulations, and there are tax certificates issued by the Ministry as evidence. We have already attached them to the submission on December 22 of last year. The silk tobacco that has been taxed in Zhangzhou and Xiamen is still subject to special taxes when sold to Jiangsu Province, which is unavoidable to obliterate the facts and forcibly distort them, hoping to transfer the loss of tax revenue from the Fujian change to the merchants to bear. It is not fair in law or reason. We have re-examined the same tax certificate and prepared a document for forwarding, requesting your review and approval, and to grant a correction in accordance with the law for the sake of the public. We are sending a document to the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<p>Executive Yuan Orders Municipal General Labor Union to Change Its New Name</p>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union has been renamed the Shanghai Trade Unions National Salvation United Association. Since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, according to the provisions of the law, only industrial workers and professional workers are allowed to organize trade unions separately. There is no so-called general labor union. After the establishment of the Municipal General Labor Union, it has not obtained legal person status because there is no legal basis. Last year, the association submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters for temporary registration. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that if the organization of the association is approved, the law and the facts will be two different things, which is very inconvenient. However, the existence of the association seems to have been recognized by the general public in the city as necessary. The bureau immediately submitted a request to the municipal government to forward it to the central government to request the amendment of the Trade Union Law in order to accommodate the facts. The bureau received the Municipal Government's Order No. 8329 yesterday, informing the Executive Yuan that it has approved the General Labor Union to change its name to the Shanghai Trade Unions National Salvation United Association, citing precedents. The full text of the original document is as follows:</p>
<p>"Case Approved, Ministry of Industry, Labor No. 2627, Opening, Case Check, Your Municipal Government's Consultation No. 1920, For the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters to temporarily approve the registration of the General Labor Union, please review and reply, the case has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for consultation with the Legislative Yuan for review, and a letter has been sent to the Central Mass Movement Guidance Committee, and a consultation has been replied to in Labor No. 2581. Later, we received a letter from the Central Mass Movement Guidance Committee No. 5398, roughly opening, above the Shanghai Municipal Government's consultation, according to the Social Affairs Bureau, to request the forwarding and amendment of the Trade Union Law, in order to avoid the legal and factual dichotomy, the case has been sent to the association by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, the association, on the grounds that the name of the General Labor Union has no legal basis and there is no precedent to follow. If it is considered necessary to unite various trade unions to engage in the national salvation against Japan, the Shanghai Municipal General Labor Union can be changed to the Shanghai Trade Unions National Salvation United Association, following the examples of Beijing, Tianjin, and Chengdu. After the letter was sent to the department for review, it was submitted to the court for review. The instructions of the Executive Yuan No. 3732 stated that after reviewing and knowing, since the Central Mass Movement Guidance Committee has changed the Shanghai Municipal General Labor Union to the Shanghai Trade Unions National Salvation United Association, citing precedents, it should be handled accordingly. Therefore, it is appropriate to consult for review," and so on.</p>
<p>According to this, it is found that this case was previously received by the department under Consultation No. 2581, and it has been ordered to the bureau. Now, according to the previous reason, it is appropriate to order the bureau to be informed. This order, the commission will improve Sichuan silk.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of experts, the Central News Agency reported that in order to improve silk throughout the country, the National Economic Commission hired Dr. Mary, an international silk expert, to design improvements. After arriving in China, Dr. Ma went to various provinces, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang, to inspect the silk situation in various provinces. In November of last year, he went to Sichuan for inspection. After returning to Shanghai, he compiled a report on the silk situation in Sichuan, which has now been completed and submitted to the National Economic Commission for review. The content of the report recognizes Sichuan as an important area for silk production, better than Jiangsu and Zhejiang, because the climate in Sichuan is suitable for silkworm rearing. It is learned that the Commission will develop the silk industry in Sichuan and promote foreign sales based on this report.</p>
<p>Cai Clan Association General Meeting Postponed</p>
<p>The Cai clan in Panhuo Bridge, Dongxiang, Ningbo, is a giant clan in Yongdong. Many have lived in Shanghai for business and have established a clan association, which has been in existence for fourteen years. According to custom, a general meeting is convened every New Year's Day in the Gregorian calendar to discuss family happiness and promote clan friendship. Because the Ningbo clan has begun to compile a genealogy, the association plans to start soliciting after the New Year in the spring for the purpose of complete reorganization, and then convene a general meeting to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Robbery of Ye Clan Temple</p>
<p>Near the railway on the manufacturing bureau road in the southern part of the city, there is a Ye clan temple, the owner of which is named Ye Yunlong. At about 5:30 last night, three bandits wearing long gowns, copper basin hats, and speaking with a northern accent suddenly came to the temple, entered the main hall on the pretext of burning incense, went straight into Ye's bedroom, showed pistols, tied up the monk who presided over the temple, and searched for a long time. They only stole one real and fake gold ring and several monk's clothes. When they were about to leave, one bandit shot the back of the monk, hitting his left wrist. The bandits dispersed and fled westward without a trace. The victim rushed to report to the Second District Police Department, which sent police to send the injured monk to Bethel Hospital for treatment. The Inspectorate was also notified to notify the districts to pay attention to intercepting the bandits.</p>
<p>Peddler of Ties and Socks Fell to the Ground and Died from Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Liu Shangzhi, a 46-year-old Anhui native who lived at No. 73 Maggie Lane, Maggie Road, French Concession, usually sold ties, socks, and other items, carrying baskets and bags, and sold them along the way to make a living. A month ago, Liu sold several ties to Lu Shaoying, an employee of a car dealership on Mad Hursht Road, for eight yuan, which was scheduled to be paid on the 15th of this month. However, when Liu went to collect the money on the due date, he could not find Lu, which led to a dispute. Later, when Liu tried to take Lu to the police station, Liu was thrown to the ground by Lu at the entrance of the car dealership, and his head was seriously injured. When Lu saw this, he wanted to help Liu up, but he was unable to do so. Another passerby happened to be passing by at that time and saw him, so he helped Lu to lift him up. Liu then hired a rickshaw to take him to Liu Changman, his cousin, at No. 159 Gobat Road. When he arrived there, it was late at night, and the bell rang seven times. So his cousin took him in for the night, and sent him home the next morning. Later, his son Licun and Wang Congjian sent him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. He died on the previous day. The hospital reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered detective Qi Mengqing to investigate, and then carried the body to the Fellen Road morgue for examination. They also went to arrest Lu and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, Lu was escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. Because the cause of Liu's death was not clear, the police did not formally prosecute him, but only requested permission to detain him. At around 10 o'clock, prosecutor Diao Chengtang of the Prosecutor's Office, accompanied by forensic scribe Wang Zuyi and others, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. According to Liu Changman's statement, he was 40 years old and worked as a cook for a Westerner at No. 159 Gobat Road in the French Concession. At about 7 o'clock that afternoon, his cousin arrived in a rickshaw. At that time, he saw that he could not walk alone. The rickshaw puller helped him to my place, and I saw that he was frowning. So I asked him what was wrong. He said that he went to the car dealership to collect money and was beaten by several people there. According to Lu Shaoying's statement, he was a Shanghainese, 29 years old, and lived at No. 10 Meiyuan Road, Zhabei. He worked as a clerk in a car dealership. That day, he came to ask me for money. I didn't have it at the time, so I made an appointment for the 16th. He didn't agree and insisted on dragging me to the police station. When he walked to the entrance of the car dealership, the cement road was uneven. He grabbed my arm, and I threw him, hitting his temple, and he fell to the ground. Later, I helped him up. At that time, a Chinese policeman came, and I asked him if he wanted to go to the police station together. He didn't want to and went away by himself. According to the statement of the deceased's son Liu Licun and others, Diao ruled that the deceased Liu Shangzhi was indeed injured in the head and died before his death. The body was handed over to his son Liu Licun to sign for and take it back for burial.</p>
<p>Fire at Inside and Outside Cotton Mill</p>
<p>At about 7:50 last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the third and fourth ginning rooms of the Inside and Outside Cotton Mill at No. 19 Xisu Xin Road, owned by a Japanese. It spread immediately, broke through the roof, and fortunately, the Yangshupu Fire Brigade nearby was notified and rushed fire trucks to put out the fire. However, the fire was very large and could not be extinguished for a while. It was not until about 9 o'clock that it gradually subsided, causing heavy losses. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.</p>

<p>Free Talk: Elementary Education and Society by Yu Dafu</p>
<p>After my own child entered kindergarten, he who was originally a mischievous brat who caused trouble all day at home actually learned to sing, write, paint, and bow. Only now do I deeply feel the greatness of that German pastor's son, Friedrich Froebel.</p>
<p>Looking at elementary education throughout China, except for some truly desolate and unbearable places that still adhere to the traditional Chinese private school system, most places have improved, progressed, and are quite effective. However, the entire Chinese society, as well as the talent serving within it—especially those holding official positions—is actually getting worse day by day. What is the reason for this? If the blame is to be placed on education, I think it must be the fault of middle school or university education? Elementary education is easy to unify and improve, while children's habits are mostly formed after entering middle school or university. Therefore, Rousseau's "Emile" and Russell's "Education" do not let go of that period of age from twelve or thirteen to over twenty. The abuse of elementary school teachers in China (such as meager salaries, increased working hours, and the complete absence of job security) is originally one reason for the decline of Chinese education. However, the irresponsibility of university and middle school authorities, treating schools as government offices, and education following politics, are undoubtedly even greater reasons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as soon as we leave university and enter society, we believe that education is irrelevant to us. The idea that being a person and studying, or being an official and getting rich, are completely unrelated like beef and diamonds, might be the final and greatest overall cause contributing to the disorder of Chinese society.</p>
<p>The ancient Chinese said, "Learn until old age!" The Athenian legislator Solon said, "I grow old year by year in the midst of constantly learning." There are certainly no middle schools for educating middle-aged people or schools for educating the elderly in the world. The important thing is only self-reflection after entering society and mutual encouragement between society and individuals.</p>
<p>A Bitter Smile Record by Shu</p>
<p>In the "Neighborly Collection," I saw a person who was most adept at a bitter smile. The so-called bitter smile here is slightly different from the general meaning. I think the most appropriate interpretation is "cheerful despite poverty." This person is He Lai. In his several letters to Jianzhai, he ridiculed himself very interestingly, and from this, we can also see his impoverished situation. For example, he said:</p>
<p>The fifth day is near, and debt collectors are pressing. Only now do I know that Qu Yuan fled to Peng Xian's residence just to avoid the Dragon Boat Festival. You should have a laugh at this.</p>
<p>Qu Ping throwing himself into the river was actually to evade debts. This is truly an extraordinary thought. It can also be seen that this man is so poor that he has no way to comfort himself, finding Qu Yuan as a "fellow sufferer." You should truly "have a laugh" at this. He also said:</p>
<p>The price of rice has suddenly increased in recent days, and the whole family cannot abstain from grain. Winter clothes are all pawned, and even hemp garments cannot be exchanged for trousers. It seems that we will either starve to death or freeze to death. Even a living Buddha Shakyamuni or Guan Yu from Lianluo could not endure such desolation. Although you are bored, you still think of practicing Zen and studying the Way, which is much better than me.</p>
<p>This letter is only bitterness and no laughter. And the last few words contain a great truth: practicing Zen and studying the Way ultimately require money. It is simply impossible if one has a family to support and no savings to leave for their food and drink. However, this man ultimately cannot help but laugh, so he writes another letter, which will make you not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>Living alone in seclusion, I have not known the year for several years. It was only because of the relentless pursuit of debts that I remembered the recent New Year, my whole body sweating as if I had touched an overturned chamber pot. Poor relatives and friends ask for calendars, like the debt collectors. I dare to burden you, sir, with this small debt; the more the better.</p>
<p>"As if I had touched an overturned chamber pot"—this wonderful metaphor is truly something only this man could come up with.</p>
<p>Vegetable Vendor by Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Outside, there is biting cold wind, goose-palm-sized snowflakes, a silver world, and a lead-colored frozen sky.</p>
<p>The time is only around six o'clock. The sky has just begun to reveal some fish-belly white. Wealthy people are still lying in warm beds, vaguely dreaming good dreams. But he, a vendor who makes a living by selling vegetables, cannot but force himself to endure the cold, his upper and lower teeth chattering, and climb out of bed for the sake of life.</p>
<p>In the dark straw hut, not a single ray of light can be seen. He gropes for a box of matches at the head of the bed. With a "sizzle," he lights the only kerosene lamp. The faint yellow flame illuminates the rickety house. Large snowflakes are drilling straight in from the gaps. All the furniture and clutter in the house appear very dilapidated.</p>
<p>"This kind of life is worse than that of pigs and dogs!" He cannot help but let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>His wife, lying at his feet, painfully turns over, letting out a "sigh!" of a groan, and half-consciously, hazily asks him:</p>
<p>"Are you going out again?"</p>
<p>He does not answer, but simply shuffles into his straw sandals, his heart aching silently. His wife suffers from severe malaria, with alternating chills and fever, which has been dragging on without getting better. In this cold winter, it is not so bad when she has a fever, but when she has the chills, it is truly miserable.</p>
<p>Putting a carrying pole through two empty vegetable baskets, he shoulders it, and holding an oiled paper umbrella under his arm, he goes out the door. A gust of cold wind carrying snowflakes hits his face, causing him to shiver uncontrollably. The kerosene lamp in the house is quickly blown out by the wind.</p>
<p>The snow "Ziaz," "Ziza" sounds under his feet as he walks to the place where he grows vegetables. The square plot of vegetable garden is completely covered with snow, with only a few hints of green showing through. He walks in familiarly, using his accustomed vegetable knife to cut the vegetables. Now, there is one more task than before: to carefully knock the snow off the vegetables. After cutting for a long time, he barely fills the two vegetable baskets. His fingers are already frozen like red carrots.</p>
<p>Vegetables that have been hit by frost and snow taste very fresh, but he cannot put even a single leaf in his mouth.</p>
<p>Growing vegetables himself, yet not being able to eat them—what an unfair life!</p>
<p>Still "Ziza," "Ziza" stepping on the snow, he walks all the way to the small vegetable market. The snow gradually disappears under his feet, replaced by slippery mud that is even harder to walk on than the snow. This mud almost makes him slip many times. He has to steady the carrying pole and walk carefully and attentively.</p>
<p>Under the large oiled cloth umbrella of the familiar fishmonger at the fish stall, he rests his vegetable load. It is still very early; not a single person has come to buy vegetables. He stands there, his hands tucked into his sleeves, a chill creeping up his legs and straight into his heart. The wind and snow relentlessly continue to lash at him.</p>
<p>A rice cake vendor stops beside him. The fragrant steam of the rice cakes and the smell of fried dough sticks fill his nostrils. This is indeed a great temptation. His stomach begins to feel a little hungry. But touching his side, he ultimately can only swallow a mouthful of saliva.</p>
<p>More and more people come to buy vegetables, and the air in the small vegetable market suddenly becomes unusually lively. The streets are filled with women carrying bamboo baskets, some being maids or older sisters who help others, and some being shrewd ladies and grandmothers holding red and green silk umbrellas and wearing leather shoes.</p>
<p>"How much is this green vegetable per catty?" A beautiful woman stands in front of him and asks.</p>
<p>"Nine coppers."</p>
<p>"Nine coppers? Too expensive. It has always been eight coppers."</p>
<p>Seeing that the female customer is about to turn away, he has to lower the price:</p>
<p>"Okay, eight coppers then."</p>
<p>So he takes out a small steelyard that he carries with him and weighs a catty of vegetables for her. But the female customer is still grumbling discontentedly, grabbing a large handful of vegetables from his basket.</p>
<p>People are mostly black-hearted, liking to squeeze the poor. What does one copper count for? And they still want to take advantage! Still want to grab vegetables!</p>
<p>Just like that, he makes sales in haggling and bargaining until noon, when he finally empties his vegetable baskets. He, like the other vegetable vendors, shoulders the empty baskets and goes home.</p>
<p>A pair of feet that have been standing on the cold, muddy ground for several hours have already been frozen numb and have lost all sensation, making even taking a step extremely difficult. As he walks, he clutches his heavy money pouch. His stomach feels hungry, but the image of his sick wife quickly flashes through his mind.</p>
<p>"This little bit of money is probably not even enough to hire a doctor for her," he thinks painfully.</p>
<p>Half a Day in Songjiang by Hua Shangwen</p>
<p>During the New Year holiday, I went to Songjiang for a visit with several friends.</p>
<p>It takes just over an hour by train from Shanghai to Songjiang. If you take the Shanghai-Songjiang long-distance bus, it might even be faster. Such a short trip is not really worth recording. However, I have lived in Shanghai on and off for more than ten years, and this was my first time visiting a place as close as Songjiang. Naturally, I gained some new impressions. If I don't write them down soon, they will soon be forgotten.</p>
<p>Mentioning Songjiang, people will think of perch. Indeed, Songjiang's perch is too famous. Most people who visit Songjiang are aiming for the perch. Our host was very considerate and specially prepared this delicacy to satisfy our desires. When we arrived at his home on the early express train, after exchanging pleasantries, he quickly told us that the perch was already prepared. After resting for over an hour, everyone was invited to the round dining table. Four platters, two jugs of old wine, followed by all sorts of delicacies were brought out one after another. Once drunk and full, everyone had forgotten almost everything. Suddenly, a large plate of fresh small fish with big mouths, fine scales, and a slight black hue was placed before everyone. Oh! This is perch! The host used chopsticks to open the reddish gills. Yes, indeed, they were double. Everyone immediately picked up their chopsticks and, like a gust of wind sweeping away fallen leaves, almost instantly cleared the large plate. The host further explained that the perch lungs were special, and one had to eat the lungs to truly taste the perch. So everyone quickly searched for the small lungs in the remaining fish bellies. After this famous small fish had completely entered everyone's stomachs, we began the afternoon's sightseeing work.</p>
<p>Our destination was to climb a pagoda, as we had already seen two tall pagodas from the train. On the way to climb the pagoda, we had to pass through the People's Education Center. It so happened that the Songfeng Society was holding a calligraphy and painting exhibition there that day, so we went in to take a look. My companion, Mr. W, is a calligrapher, and Mr. M is an artist. Like finding gold in a pile of sand, they both paid special attention to their viewing. Mr. M pointed to a Western painting and sighed, saying:</p>
<p>"Looking at it in parts, there are some good things, but the whole thing completely lacks unity and harmony. The artist may claim to be some kind of Impressionist or Futurist. Chinese Western painting has not yet laid a solid foundation, and yet some people are coming out to promote the latest European and American movements. As a result, later students will inevitably go astray."</p>
<p>After viewing the exhibition, we headed towards the West Gate. This place and the area in front of the government are said to be the most bustling places in Songjiang City. However, the narrow streets and simple shops fully show a backward small city that has been exploited. In the midst of the shops decorated with red and green paper, we occasionally discovered one or two small-fronted workshops, which deepened our lament for the decline of the handicraft society.</p>
<p>In the Dongyue Temple, food stalls, vendors' stalls, and fortune-tellers' tables were chaotically arranged. However, the bustling scene was far less than that of the City God Temple in Shanghai or the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou. Many people were gathered around watching a white goat.</p>
<p>Mr. C said:</p>
<p>"This goat has a strange quirk. It can eat cigarettes."</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<p>Two Brothers (9) by Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>"Look... look..." Roland kept shouting, "It's coming straight towards us."</p>
<p>So Bocci Roux was extremely happy, repeatedly saying:</p>
<p>"Didn't I say it right? Huh? Aren't I familiar with their routes?"</p>
<p>Jean said softly to his mother:</p>
<p>"Look, Mom, it's getting closer."</p>
<p>So Mother Roland opened her eyes, which were clouded with tears.</p>
<p>In this clear, peaceful weather, the "Lorraine" mail ship, which was speeding as fast as it could as soon as it left the harbor, had already come closer. Bocci Roux put up the telescope and reported:</p>
<p>"Be careful! Pierre is standing on the stern of the ship, all alone, I can see him very clearly. Be careful!"</p>
<p>The ship, as tall as a mountain and as fast as a train, was now passing almost rubbing against the "Pearl." Mother Roland, excited and frenzied, stretched out her arms to her good son. She saw her son, Pierre, wearing his uniform cap with the badge, throwing some farewell kisses with both hands. But he was gone, he had fled, he had disappeared, and had already become very small, as if he had been erased like a tiny black dot on the large ship. She still wanted to try her best to make him out, but she could no longer distinguish him.</p>
<p>Jean took her hand and said:</p>
<p>"Did you see him?"</p>
<p>"I saw him. He's so good!"</p>
<p>So everyone turned and headed towards the city.</p>
<p>"Huh, it's going so fast," Roland said with a kind of fervent conviction.</p>
<p>The mail ship was indeed shrinking second by second, as if it had dissolved into the ocean. Mother Roland turned to it, watching it disappear below the horizon, heading towards a foreign land, the other end of the world. On this ship that nothing could stop, on this ship that she would soon no longer be able to see, was her son, her good, poor son. She felt that half of her good heart had gone with him. She also felt that her life was over, and she also felt that she would never see her child again.</p>
<p>"Why are you crying? Anyway, he'll be back in less than a month," her husband asked. She stammered in reply:</p>
<p>"I don't know. I'm crying because I feel sad."</p>
<p>When they returned to land, Bocci Roux immediately parted ways with them to go to a friend's house for lunch. So Jean and Mrs. Luxmi walked ahead, and Roland said to his wife:</p>
<p>"In any case, our Jean's looks are not bad."</p>
<p>"Yes," the mother replied.</p>
<p>Because her mind was so confused, she unconsciously added:</p>
<p>"I am very happy that he is marrying Mrs. Luxmi."</p>
<p>The good gentleman was greatly surprised and said:</p>
<p>"Oh my! What? Is he going to marry Mrs. Luxmi?"</p>
<p>"Yes. We had already planned to ask for your consent today."</p>
<p>"Huh! Huh! Have you been discussing this for a long time?"</p>
<p>"Ah! No. It's only been a few days. Jean wanted to be sure that she would agree before discussing it with you."</p>
<p>Old Father Roland rubbed his hands and said:</p>
<p>"Excellent, excellent. This is very good. I absolutely agree." As they were about to leave the pier and walk onto the Boulevard François 1er, his wife turned back one last time to cast a glance at the sea. But she only saw a little bit of grey smoke, so far away, so faint, that it was almost like mist. (The End)</p>

<p>Commercial News: Financial Foreign Exchange Boosts Rising Trend, Gold Price Soars Fourteen Yuan Two Jiao</p>
<p>American Bank Exchange Rate Continues to Contract, Opening Market Rises Immediately</p>
<p>Sassoon Aggressively Buys American Exchange Rate, Helping Prices Rise Straight Up</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw exceptional strength due to Sassoon &amp; Co.'s aggressive buying of American exchange rates and an unusually tight domestic market. In the morning, overseas silver markets were flat in both England and America, while the Far East Silver Exchange's silver prices fell by varying amounts from 0.2 to 3.5%. Exchange rates continued to decline, American wheat showed mixed ups and downs, American cotton fell 9 points, and stocks rose slightly. The wool market opened at 82.3 yuan, but large dealers were still selling off, and prices hovered between 76 and 77 yuan in the downstream market. After the opening, the domestic market tightened and gold prices rose. Later, Sassoon &amp; Co. aggressively bought up contracts, and the exchange market became increasingly tense, with large dealers such as Hengyu, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Hongxing, and Dachangxiang competing to buy, intensifying the upward trend. At noon, prices nearly approached the 90-yuan mark, supposedly due to Reuters news slightly favoring the US dollar. In the afternoon, the market opened indecisively. Later, due to Sassoon's renewed aggressive buying, prices rose beyond the 90-yuan mark. However, Reuters then reported that the US President had ordered all gold in the nation to be concentrated in the government by the 17th, causing prices to retreat into the 90-yuan range, and the situation became swirling. Later, the news that the Seattle night market silver price had risen 40 points led to a brief downstream movement, but banks took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and prices finally stabilized. Overall, the market was unusually strong throughout the day, successively breaking through the two major barriers of 80 and 90 yuan. The market seemed dry, and sellers were slightly fatigued, leading to this situation. The asking price was 1072 yuan. The market conditions of the day are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 677 yuan, a rise of 2 yuan and 4 jiao compared to the previous closing. Goods opened at the same price. The morning opening exchange rate for immediate delivery was 1 shilling, 4 pence, 375 for British exchange and 34.5 yuan for American exchange. Mitsui sold April American dollars at 35.125 yuan, and Zhengjin sold March American dollars at 875 yuan. Yuanchun divested, retreating to 6.5 jiao. Zhifeng, Yongwanxing, Hengyu, Daxing, Yongfeng, Yuansheng, Yongfuyu, and others paid margin calls. Overseas Chinese bought May American dollars at 3.125 yuan, and prices rose to around 80 yuan. Zhengjin sold April dollars at 35 yuan, and Yuanmao and Yongshunli divested, falling to 8.4 jiao. However, it was anticipated that the HSBC bank would list British exchange at par and American exchange contracting by 0.25. Dadecheng and Hengyu paid margin calls. Sassoon &amp; Co., acting on behalf of Zhengjin, aggressively bought May American dollars at 0.25, and the situation remained stable. Later, Hengyu, Dadecheng, and Fuyu repeatedly entered margin calls, rising to 80 yuan and 8 jiao. Hengxing sold calls, briefly dropping by 1 yuan, but as the domestic market continued to tighten, Sassoon's aggressive buying did not stop. May American dollars had already reached 1.875 yuan. Hengyu, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Hongli, Hongxing, and others aggressively bought at consecutive prices, rising to 84 yuan and 4 jiao. Banque Belge came out with May dollars at 35 yuan and retreated. Sassoon bought April American dollars at 0.75, and prices remained stable. Later, although Yuanmao and Yonghengxing sold, sentiment was firm. Dadecheng, Hengxingyuan, Hengyu, Fuyu, Hongxing, Yuanchun, Dachangxiang, Yida, and Yonglu continued to buy. Sassoon bought April American dollars at 0.625 and May dollars at 0.875, rising to 6.5 yuan. Tongtaichang and Yuanmao took advantage of the high prices to sell, falling back by 1 yuan. Finally, due to aggressive margin calls on goods and scattered buying from small investors, Sassoon bought May American dollars at 0.8125, rising to 7.8 jiao. The noon close was at 687 yuan and 6 jiao. After the closing, goods continued to rise, and Yida and Yongfuyu continued to pay margin calls, rising beyond 9 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 8 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was at 688 yuan and 8 jiao, and goods opened at 8 yuan and 4 jiao. Bingxing entered and then exited, retreating from 9 yuan to 7 yuan and 6 jiao, but because Sassoon and Zhengjin bought May American dollars at 0.75, prices remained stable. Hengyu, Yifengyong, and Hongli entered margin calls. Sassoon bought May American dollars again at 0.6875 and April dollars at 0.4375, rising to 91 yuan and 4 jiao. Bingxing, Dadecheng, and Hengxing sold calls, and negative news spread, causing prices to fall to 88 yuan and 4 jiao. Hengyu, Shunli, Qianchangxiang, Yuansheng, and Yong again entered, and prices rose again to 91 yuan. Citibank and Banque Belge came out with May American dollars at 0.6875, retreating into the 90-yuan range, but because Sassoon was still buying, the gold market remained stable. Later, news came from overseas that the Seattle silver market had risen 30 points. Yuanmao and Yong continuously sold, and Yuanfengyong, Fu'anshunli, Hengxing, Hongli, and others sold one after another, retreating to 6 yuan and 4 jiao. Mitsui bought May American dollars at 0.875. Bingxing and Dadecheng aggressively bought, rising again to 8 yuan. Zhaofengchang and Hengyu further advanced to beyond 9 yuan. After wavering, the closing was at 688 yuan and 8 jiao, and goods were auctioned at 8 yuan and 4 jiao. After the closing, Hongli came to sell and prices slightly fell. Overall, the highest price of the day was 691 yuan and 4 jiao, and the lowest price was 676 yuan and 5 jiao, a fluctuation of 14 yuan and 9 jiao. As a result, the closing price rose 14 yuan and 2 jiao compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The listed price shrank 0.25 because Hongfeng Bank's American exchange listing was 33 yuan and 875, combining for a gold price of 708 yuan and change. According to the closing price, this was about 9 yuan weaker, less than the previous closing by 9 yuan. The registration price for this month was 711 yuan, for February 702 yuan, and for March 688 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 711 yuan, and the afternoon water replenishment was 712 yuan. The asking price was still calculated at 1072 yuan. The market trend was firm, and customer syndicates initially sold and then bought aggressively. The transaction volume was brisk in the morning and light in the afternoon. It is estimated that the Tianjin syndicate sold about 2,000 taels to the Yingfeng Hengdafeng Hengda Dadecheng Taikangrun among its colleagues, ranging from 1072.5 to 74.5 yuan. In the afternoon, more than 500 taels were sold by colleagues to the Tianjin syndicate, ranging from 1077 to 79 yuan. In the current swap, Dadecheng paid Shunli 21 contracts at 13.3 yuan in the morning market. In the afternoon market, Dakang paid Shunli 70 contracts at 13.1 jiao. It was heard that Dadecheng had posted 13 yuan. There are currently 1,841 contracts for this month.</p>
<p>Trading was lively in the market. Overall, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Dachangxiang, Zhifengyong, Fuyu, Hongxing, Zhaofengchang, Hengxingyuan, Daxingyong, Yuanmaoshen, Kangqianchangxiang, Yidayong, Tongyiwanxing, and others were on the buying side. Hengxing, Hengtai, Ruikangxianghe, Yuanmaoyong, Sida, Yuanxingyong, Tongchunyong, Deyongda, Fayongqingfa, Yonghongli, Ruixingfuchang, Yuanchun, and others were on the selling side. Bingxing Yiyu Hengchang Yonghuixiang Futaiheng exited and then entered. The Dalian syndicate Wanxing did a total of over 5,300, netting in slightly less than 1,500. Shunli did a total of slightly over 3,400, netting in little. The Guangdong syndicate Hengxing issued around 1,000, netting in over 200 contracts. There were 7,553 contracts in February, and 39,375 contracts in March.</p>

<p>Film Special "The Hunger of Sex" in Hollywood (Part 1) by Si Ying</p>
<p>Superficially displaying extravagance and licentiousness, but in essence, extraordinarily chaste and quiet. This is an article describing life in Hollywood. It exaggerates the purity of Hollywood, but is nonetheless reasonable. I have now translated it for you; believe it or not, it's up to you.</p>
<p>A group of dancing girls strolls around the film set. They are wearing swimsuits. If the police saw them wearing such revealing clothes at the beach, they would take out a measuring tape to measure them, or even take them to the police station! ... On the stage of a nearby set, there is a red-haired star walking gracefully under huge silver lights. There are fifty or so spectators below the stage, but they are various technical personnel, such as photographers, lighting technicians, workers, actors, etc. The clothes worn by that star, if put together, probably wouldn't cover two stamps. On the stage, she is performing a scene of passionately burning love with a male supporting actor... According to you, these are all about sex, entirely about sex.</p>
<p>In fact, no matter how many scantily clad beauties can be seen there, no matter how many passionate embraces and kisses they have, Hollywood is the city in the world with the least sex! In the decoration of the stage, in the walks under the shade of trees on the road, in the leisurely reclining on the beach, of course, Hollywood is more sensual than any other city of the same size. But Hollywood is ultimately a society suffering from sexual starvation.</p>
<p>You may have heard about the extravagant, licentious, and immoral large banquets held in the homes of various big-name celebrities. And the divorce news published in large characters in the newspapers every day. And many nude photos of female stars, which can make your eyes pop out... In reality, there are very few movie queens who are unwilling to take off their undershirts to perform for the entertainment of the audience. However, those are all scenes of one corner of Hollywood, that is, a corner manufactured for public consumption. The commercial value of Hollywood studios exploiting sensuality is like the sensational social news in newspapers; can you blame them or prohibit them? But in private life, Hollywood is more chaste than athletes training in an Olympic stadium.</p>
<p>Of course, there are immoral banquets. There are also love affairs. But in total, the number of immoral banquets and deceptions in Hollywood is not as many as in a common small city! Don't you see that half of the husbands in small cities are chasing after other people's women!... The reason is that people who want to make a living in Hollywood are diligent in training their own bodies, and don't care about chasing after men and women, because only by having a well-trained body can they endure the hardship of work, unless they are willing to give up on themselves.</p>
<p>So if you are new to Hollywood, and your friend sincerely entertains you, you must not show a lecherous attitude. He may ask you if you want a woman, he will tell you that there are all kinds of women... red-haired, blonde, black-haired, all kinds, each one charming and beautiful, for you to choose, you can turn around and say "no." In this way, your friend will be relieved, because those are just his courtesies, it doesn't mean that he must introduce you to a girlfriend. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e131">Film Review "Power and Glory" by Yi Qun <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Power and Glory</p>
<p>Showing at the Great Shanghai Theater</p>
<p>If we admit that... love is only a part of life, not the whole of life, and that the whole of life should be devoted to many social tasks, then it is reasonable to say that any propaganda and preaching that stands on the viewpoint of love supremacy, denies life, and denies everything, should be seriously criticized, and this inevitably becomes our task.</p>
<p>This film "Power and Glory" by Fox seems to be a powerful promotion of love supremacy, and incidentally, it instills some toxins that obliterate facts.</p>
<p>We do not oppose the inevitable pain that a person will suffer from being lovelorn, nor do we deny the fact that there are fools in society who commit suicide due to being lovelorn, but to depict these facts without giving clear instructions, and to promote and magnify the greatness of suicide for being lovelorn in many ways, and to gain the sympathy of the audience, this kind of influence should be discarded no matter what.</p>
<p>Shan Laiyin Jia Niu committed suicide by crashing his car because he had a new love, which can perhaps be blamed on the narrow-mindedness of women, but Jia Niu, who created "power" and "glory" through hard work, also committed suicide because his new love had another new love, and he thought that "power" and "glory" were over. This not only shows that Jia Niu ignored the tasks of life and indulged in the quagmire of love supremacy, but also fully proves that the creators of this play did not understand the meaning of life. At the very least, a person's "power" and "glory" should not be given up for love!</p>
<p>Furthermore, what is the so-called "power and glory" in this film? It can be clearly seen that... "power" is only that Jia Niu can suppress the strike of railway workers, and "glory" is only the submission and respect of eight or nine gentle gentlemen for Jia Niu at the meeting. What value can this kind of unreasonable "power" and "glory" representing a small number of people have?</p>
<p>The above is our criticism of the consciousness of "Power and Glory."</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the technical aspects of the performance, there are many things that deserve our praise. First, the director William K. Howard handled this story very well. He purely used a narrative method to depict the deeds of Jia Niu's life and the friendship between Jia Niu and Henry's life, from the tone of old Henry explaining to his wife. This technique is not an original creation in the film industry, but it is naturally more powerful than other similar films. Even the many inversions and repetitions in the narration of Jia Niu's deeds are not considered chaotic, because this is enough to explain the disorganized nature of old Henry's narration. Moreover, the use of a thin shadow to distinguish the changes in the screen of each narrative segment further demonstrates his intelligence. Second, Spencer Tracy, who played Jia Niu, and Rahph Morgan, who played Henry, both performed well. It is a pity that the makeup of Jia Niu in his old age is slightly less realistic due to the contours and lines of his face, otherwise, it would be even more vivid.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the photography, I heard that this photographer is a Chinese, although it is not uncommon for Chinese people to make good films, but we cannot obliterate it, and hereby express our respect, because he is indeed good!</p>
<p>Review of "Dinner at Eight" by Ling He</p>
<p>Dinner at Eight</p>
<p>Showing at the Cathay Theater</p>
<p>According to a survey, in 1932, among the American film companies, only MGM had a slight profit, while all other companies lost money. This tragic phenomenon has forced the producers to be cautious, so much so that due to economic uncertainty, they dare not stipulate the production schedule for the entire year of 1933, but can only decide on a half-year schedule. In this situation, using many big stars to attract audiences is naturally one of the methods of struggling. This really explains the motives for making films such as "Dinner at Eight" and "Hell Below".</p>
<p>The decline in business and the shaking of the entire economic foundation, this huge wave broke through all the dikes, and the film industry was similarly affected, what a shocking phenomenon!</p>
<p>Because of this misfortune, film producers and even film artists in the Golden State have suffered unavoidable and serious blows, and directly feel the personal unease. Therefore, they feel that this misfortune is undeniable, and all the truths that were usually considered ugly must also be paid attention to without being embellished. Therefore, "Dinner at Eight" takes this unfortunate truth as its theme and creates this sad and melancholic sketch.</p>
<p>The owner of the shipping company has to find a way to get huge amounts of working capital from British aristocrats because of the shipping industry's slump; the shareholders of the shipping company have to sell their shares due to economic difficulties; famous actors can no longer get a salary of eight thousand yuan a week from the stage manager and commit suicide... These are exposed by the screenwriter without any cover-up. I think this is quite lovely. In addition, the wife of a nouveau riche from a dancer background does not want to lose the opportunity to set foot in upper-class society due to her husband's conspiracy; the shipping company owner's daughter blindly falls in love with a once-famous actor, and the actor, because he looks down on everything and sees through everything, has to commit suicide; a socialite falls in love with a doctor; these are all used by the playwright as theatrical material. So-called hypocritical life is nothing more than this. In the end, the aristocrats that everyone expected did not come, and the hope of digging a hole in the aristocrats to get a huge sum of money to save the economic crisis disappeared like a dream. Here, we seem to be able to appreciate Chekhov's bitter smile, and the atmosphere of "Grand Hotel" resurfaces. However, in fact, the playwright finally comforts this group of people in society as much as possible, doesn't he? The nouveau riche does not need to be treacherous and sabotage again, but should maintain each other, and the shareholders should also reluctantly understand each other, and the boss must also support his illness, and the wife must still manage everything and take care of the final appearance after a painful cry. As a result, the precarious shipping company can be extended for a while. Under this implication, perhaps this society with thousands of holes can be stable for a while? However, this is always just a dream.</p>
<p>I think, regarding the story, it should be understood in this way.</p>
<p>In this script, there is indeed something to be done. It surpasses "Hell Below" in terms of performance effect, which should be attributed to the brilliance of the story. What's more, there are many first-class big stars working hard to perform, and the supporting actors are also excellent actors. Of course, this has already guaranteed the success of the performance.</p>
<p>Because of the tight structure of the story, it is naturally not scattered. Moreover, under the director's refined and lively approach, smoothness and economy are the most obvious advantages, and every actor has the ability to develop their performance. John Barrymore showed his entire ability in just two scenes. The most obvious is the process from drinking to the end of the wine, the subtle changes in the heart, and the extremely delicate contemplation, which is truly amazing. Katharine Hepburn is also very delicate, eating candy, applying powder, putting on lipstick, baring her chest, and the changes in her tone, all of which are due to her performance to illustrate the director's cleverness. Warner Oland's rudeness, Billie Burke's ease, Marie Dressler's neurosis, Lionel Barrymore's morbid state, Edward Arnold's integrity, Lee Tracy's frustration, etc., all the way to the hotel owner's merchant face, each one achieves the highest results.</p>
<p>Of course, this kind of film is not difficult to produce in the United States, but it is not easy to try this kind of expression play in China.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, this article cannot be too long, and it is very brief, especially about the introduction of the director and the criticism of his techniques, which is said even less, and will be supplemented in another article later.</p>
<p>Nanjing Will Replace New Seats Soon</p>
<p>The importance of theater seats has been valued by advanced film entrepreneurs. The owner of the Nanjing Grand Theater in this city, in view of the fact that the seats in the theater are too old and dilapidated, will replace the seats in the theater with new ones to meet the needs of the audience. The style of the new seats is similar to that of the seats in the Great Light Building, which is known as the most beautiful in Shanghai, but after being transformed by experts, the comfort of the seat, the moderate seat height, the high-quality materials, and the beautiful appearance are better than any other seats. As for the color embellishment of the new seats, not only does it not conflict with the various objects in the theater, but it echoes inside and outside, connecting up and down. The chair surface is covered with silk woven floral silk, which has been improved five or six times and selected for several months before it is finalized, and its beauty can be imagined. It is said that they are now working day and night to catch up with the work and will be installed soon.</p>
<p>Film Novel and Song Tan's Peerless "The Cat and the Fiddle" (10) by Mo Chen</p>
<p>"Hi diddle diddle" Victor tried his best to sing with a smile. Suddenly, his heart stopped beating, his heroine... was already on stage, and now she was singing with him... but the one singing with him was not the old, decrepit old woman... it was Shirley! Shirley... she was more beautiful than before... more beautiful than the image he could remember... more beautiful than what he dreamed of every night... He held her in his arms... this was originally acting, but now her hair was rubbing against his face, her chest was tightly pressed against his chest, and two hearts were beating in resonance! It was as if the dark stage had turned into a bright paradise. He held her and jumped behind the paper cow, which was part of the set, so the three of them... the boy and the girl and the ridiculous cow, jumped behind the moon on the stage together. The curtain also fell with it.</p>
<p>When the curtain fell, the applause and cheers of the entire audience were about to blow the roof off. In the corner of the stage behind the curtain, Victor grabbed Shirley's hand, but Shirley pulled it back. Victor pleaded in a low voice, "Shirley, baby, I have a lot to say to you." Shirley's mouth curved and she said coldly, "No need to say anything." Victor earnestly begged, "The reason I left you before was because I was afraid of hindering your future, afraid of hindering your happiness and success... so I had no choice but to leave you." Shirley suddenly thought of what Victor had said before, "Our affair is long over," and a wave of old hatred returned to her heart, so she wanted to leave again. Victor followed her closely, all the way to the front of her dressing room door. He bitterly begged her, "Shirley, you have to listen to me, I know you love me. The reason you came here to help me is because you love me and can't forget me." Shirley laughed and said, "The reason I came here is because I don't want to watch someone sent to prison. Even if you go to jail, I don't want to sit idly by and do nothing!" She gracefully walked into the dressing room, and the door immediately closed tightly.</p>
<p>Victor had no choice but to return to his own dressing room, where Dauda was waiting for him in the room. When Dauda saw Victor coming in, he immediately stood up and said to Victor with a smile, "Victor, today's performance was really good. I came here to congratulate you." Victor stared at him fiercely and said, "Dauda, listen, you can't marry Shirley. She loves me. Although I am of low status and dare not think that way, she does love me." "Are you sure you're right?" Dauda put on a questioning look. Victor laughed and said, "Of course I'm right. The fact that she came to be my heroine tonight is the best proof." Dauda smiled contemptuously and said, "Alas, my poor child, do you really think she still loves you! Don't you know that I brought her here today!" Victor also replied with a corresponding cold laugh. He said, "Of course I know. Why are you so concerned about me... is it? And also very clever... is it? There's no way to get me out of the way... so you can calmly arrange things... is it? But you forgot one thing, that is, I am younger than you, and she is also young, and we are deeply in love..." Dauda said with a cold smile, "I'm afraid that only in a light opera can you see a young and beautiful heroine fall in love with a young and handsome hero and marry him. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Actually Mixed Through Customs and Shipped to America</p>
<p>Discovered After Reaching America, Shanghai Investigates</p>
<p>丨All Involved in the Case Have Been Arrested丨</p>
<p>The Huidetong barge number 144 loaded four boxes of yellow weasel pelts (totaling 9,728 pieces) belonging to the Yuxing Foreign Firm on May 18th of last year (1933), unloading them onto the Changxing Company's Canadian steamship for shipment to America. Because the steamship didn't arrive until the 21st, the cargo was only transferred then. However, during the three days the four boxes of yellow weasel pelts were on the barge, three boxes were stolen by the crew and merchants (totaling 7,251 pieces, valued at 8,500 yuan). Only one box remained untouched. These thieves were extraordinarily meticulous. After stealing the yellow weasel pelts from the boxes, they replaced them with coal, wrapped in burlap sacks, and placed back into the boxes. The weight was made to match the original box weight, and then the original boxes were restored to their original state, with the lead seals soldered with tin to hide any tampering. This allowed them to pass inspection when loading onto the Canadian steamship. It was only discovered after the steamship arrived in America, and a telegram was sent to Shanghai. The Water Police Department arrested the barge owner Wang Zhubao, the crew members Gu Baolang, Gu Xuejiang, and others, totaling seven people. They denied the charges during interrogation, and were initially released by order. Later, detectives Cheng Yongnian and Shen Agui of the Water Police Department secretly discovered that the yellow weasel pelts were indeed stolen and sold by the crew. They reported this to their captain and re-arrested the seven men, interrogating them severely. They finally confessed that the seven men on the ship had shared 900 yuan. They were then sent to the District Court. After a hearing, Wang Zhubao was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, and Gu Baolang, Gu Xuejiang, and the other six were each sentenced to four months imprisonment. Last month, Gu Ergou and Gong Adidi, two accomplices who helped sell the stolen goods, were also arrested and sent to the court to await trial. The other day, detectives Cheng Yongnian, Shen Agui, and Shen Guoqing of the Water Police Department arrested the key suspects in the case, Ye Aweng (45 years old, from Ningbo) and Yang Xiaogui (25 years old, from Ningbo), and brought them to the police station. According to Ye and Yang, "We are brokers. These yellow weasel pelts were entrusted to Qiu Chongqing and Jin Xiqing to broker them to a foreign firm on Renji Road, where they were negotiated with the comprador Zhuang Kunshun. We selected 4,000 pieces from the total and received a price of 3,260 taels and four mace of silver." The detectives questioned Zhuang Kunshun, who claimed, "They sold them to my firm in the name of Dashengchang. I didn't know they were stolen goods." Yesterday afternoon, an official document was prepared and detectives were sent to transfer Ye Aweng and Yang Xiaogui to the District Court to await interrogation.</p>
<p>After the Suzhou Creek Congestion</p>
<h3 id="e133">Inland Steamships Take Detours <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>=Taidong and Other Suzhou-Wuxi Lines Temporarily Suspended=</p>
<p>=Only the Hangzhou-Lake Lines Continue Normal Operation=</p>
<p>The Suzhou Creek in our city is a crucial passage for inland waterway navigation. In recent years, due to increasing siltation, when the tide recedes, numerous vessels become grounded on the silt, unable to proceed. Although the tides have been very high recently, as the end of the lunar year approaches, the amount of goods coming to Shanghai from rural areas seeking to be sold has been exceptionally high. In addition, various flour mills are ordering American wheat, which is being imported and transferred to the mills for use. These ships are all very large, resulting in congestion. Small inland steamships coming to Shanghai from places like Suzhou and Wuxi are blocked near the Sampan Bridge and Chadaijiao area, unable to approach the docks. Passengers must disembark there, complaining bitterly. Various steamship companies, such as Taidong, Xiexing, and Daishengchang, seeing that the Suzhou and Suzhou-Wuxi lines were unable to operate in reality, suspended operations the other day to avoid losses. However, the Laogongmao Steamship Company still operated as scheduled to Wuxi yesterday afternoon, with the driver devising methods to transfer via the outer river to benefit passengers. As for the China Merchants inland small steamships, they also operated as usual today. Small steamers from other companies such as Yuantong Steamship Company, which operate to Huzhou and Hangzhou, all operate on schedule without interruption. Even though there was heavy snowfall yesterday, ships still operated without obstruction.</p>

<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation of the French Concession Nanyang Bridge sent a letter to the French Concession Police Headquarters' Consul-General yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, according to the resolution of the second general meeting of our association, members proposed that recently, banditry has been rampant and robbery cases have been frequently heard. With the end of the lunar year approaching, it is a time for merchants to settle accounts. Without increased protection, it will be insufficient to maintain security. It was unanimously resolved to write to your Consul-General requesting attention to winter security and adding more patrols, etc. Our colleagues believe that your Consul-General has been effective in maintaining security in the concession and has long been admired by the citizens. As the end of the year approaches, it is a time for our merchants to go back and forth collecting payments, making them vulnerable to criminals. Therefore, special attention should be paid to security and protection provided. For this reason, we are writing to request that your Consul-General examine and approve the addition of patrols at key intersections of various roads, and also request that detectives be dispatched to increase patrols in order to emphasize security and maintain commerce. Sincerely, etc."</p>

<p>=More than a dozen people involved, dozens of households deceived=</p>
<p>=Shuts down after the bad checks mature=</p>
<p>丨Police arrested 4 people, sent to court for investigation丨</p>
<p>More than a dozen swindlers including Zhou Yimei, Huang Ziping (aka Zhou Ziping), Zhao Lijian, Zhang Zhihong, Li Fukang, Tian Xiaolong, Zhou Songhe, Bao Meifang, and Wang Lvqiao, successively set up fake companies such as Xintai on 7 Shenxing Lane, Minguo Road in the French Concession; Baoxing on 1 Xinle Lane, Mintiniyin Road; Hefeng on 9 Yuanshang Lane, East Zilaihuo Street; and Xiexingxiang Foreign Goods Store near the Rubbish Bridge in the British Concession, with a total of five or six fraudulent companies. All assets were rented, and the decorations were complete and luxurious. They successively purchased 32 dozen thermos bottles from Guohua Thermos Bottle Shop on Wuchang Road; 212 dozen thermos bottles from Tonghe Sundries Shop on 13 Xingye Lane, Tianzhutang Street; dozens of bundles of goods from Baofeng Woolen Mill on 3 Jinjiafang in the Chinese area; 20 bolts of cloth from Dingxing Shop, Renmei Lane, Zilaihuo Street; and automobile oil worth over 10,000 gold from Texaco. There were dozens of victims in total. When the goods were delivered, they were paid with bad checks totaling over 50,000 gold in value. When the checks matured, Zhou and the others shut down the companies and fled. Only then did the victims realize they had been scammed. They reported to the police separately. Now, head detective Wang Rusong, detectives Lu Zhulin, deputy detectives Zhang Rong, and detectives Bao Chengyulin of the French Police Station discovered Tian Xiaolong and Bao Meifang bathing at Wulongchi on Zhejiang Road, and immediately arrested them. They later apprehended Zhou Songque and Wang Lvqiao at 285 Tianjin Road and the Chunjiang Hotel. Little of the original stolen goods were recovered. They were taken to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Second Special Court. The police lawyer Chen Ming presented the case, stating that there were many accomplices in this case, who had all fled, and requested a postponement for further arrest and investigation. The judge ordered the defendants to be detained and granted a postponement for further hearing.</p>

<p>=Guanyun Poetry Riddle Society Sets up a Clever Device=</p>
<p>=Hidden Entrance, Secret Room, Infinite Wonders=</p>
<p>丨Police Discover Underlying Secrets and Confiscate Many Poetry Riddle Slips丨</p>
<p>Poetry riddles were originally an elegant game for literati. Since becoming a tool for gambling, their quality has declined, and poets and writers disdain them. Later, the police authorities strictly enforced bans, and the gambling on poetry riddles gradually subsided. Only a few establishments such as Guanyunji on Aiduya Road remained, barely surviving. Recently, the owner of Guanyunji, in order to ensure the safety of gamblers, opened a secret room, like a suite. In the larger room, two or three mahjong tables were placed, and a hole less than a foot in diameter was made in the wall separating it from the secret room, with a small door that could be opened and closed. After gamblers arrived, they gathered in the large room to play mahjong, while the person managing the poetry riddles in the secret room placed the poetry slips at the entrance of the hole for people to read, chant, and place bets. If a police warning was heard, the door to the hole would be immediately closed, and the poetry riddle gamblers would transform into bamboo forest companions or mahjong generals. With this design, they could enjoy the pleasure of double gambling without the risk of committing a crime. Those addicted to poetry riddle gambling flocked there, and the place was truly crowded. However, the secret was eventually revealed. The night before, Chief Detective Xue Zhiwen of the Laozha Police Station went to the establishment to investigate. On the surface, he only saw people playing mahjong, but Detective Xue had known the device in advance and searched the secret room, finding many poetry riddle slips. He arrested Ma Chaoqun and Chen Qinghe, the persons in charge of Guanyunji, and yesterday sent them to the First Special District District Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit for gambling. Judge Wu Xiangzu interrogated them and sentenced the two defendants, Ma and Chen, to a fine of 30 yuan each, and confiscated the gambling equipment. From now on, another gambling den that offered poetry riddles, like morning stars that are few and far between, has been eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Municipal Government Special Bus <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>=Reduce Travel Time=</p>
<p>=Sell Commuter Tickets=</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Merchant Public Bus Company officially started running the Municipal Government route on the 1st of this month, which has been widely praised by local people. The company, recognizing that the line is mostly used by government officials and school staff and students, and also in order to cater to people coming and going, decided to add a special bus service on the 20th of this month. The buses will depart from the North Station from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, and from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day. The buses will only stop at the Tiantong'an and Fudan University stations; all other stations will be skipped. The fares are divided by stops: from the North Station to Tiantong'an, 14 copper coins; to Fudan, 33 copper coins; and to the Municipal Government, 2 jiao in small silver coins. The company has also printed various commuter tickets for passengers' convenience, to avoid the inconvenience of carrying heavy copper coins. These tickets are sold at the company's parking terminal management staff at the Baoshan Road intersection, and at the general office at the end of Jiaotong Road. According to the regulations, the ticket system is more cost-effective than paying fares individually. It is also heard that the buses on the North Station to Jiangwan line will reduce their operating hours starting on the 20th of this month, as the weather is cold during the period from late winter to early spring, and there are very few passengers every night. Except for Saturdays and Sundays, when the schedule will remain the same, on other weekdays, the last bus from the North Station will be changed from 9:34 PM to 7:55 PM, and the last bus from Jiangwan will be changed from 10:04 PM to 8:25 PM.</p>

<p>The topic is Bank Accounting and Chinese Bookkeeping Methods</p>
<p>In order to promote the academic progress of all staff and students, the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank has organized an academic lecture series. The series is held every two weeks, inviting prominent figures to give lectures. Since its establishment, it has been nearly half a year, and the results have been quite good. Many people from the banking and finance sectors in our city attended the last lecture. The next lecture will be held at 1:00 PM on the 21st of this month (Sunday). The bank has invited accountant Xu Yongzuo to lecture, and he has already accepted the invitation, with the topic being "Bank Accounting and Chinese Bookkeeping Methods." Mr. Xu has always been a researcher in accounting, and will no doubt present a grand theory at that time. It is heard that the bank has prepared admission tickets, and those in the industry who wish to attend can send a letter to request them.</p>
<p>French Police Detectives</p>
<h3 id="e141">Discover Three Robbers on Patrol <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>=Loitering in the Jiasiyi Road Area=</p>
<p>=Planning to Rob a Certain Family on Fulili Road=</p>
<p>During the winter security period, Jin Jiulin, the police inspector of the French Concession Police Station, divided the officers into groups to patrol the area day and night. Around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Jin instructed detectives Qian Yumin and Zhang Ziying and deputy detectives Jiang Changwen to lead detectives Dai Rongji and Xu Qintang to inspect pedestrians. They saw three suspicious-looking thugs loitering in the darkness in the Jiasiyi Road area. The detectives ordered them to stop, approached, and searched them. They immediately found a six-inch handgun, several bullets, two knives, an iron bar, and a flashlight on the three thugs. They were all taken to the Songshan Road Police Station for further investigation. The interrogation revealed that one was "Liu Lanxi, 30 years old, from Tianjin," one was "Niu Xiaoduo, 24 years old, from Hebei," and one was "He Xishan, 39 years old, from Tianjin." All were weavers and are currently unemployed. They all live at 11 Luban Road in the Chinese area. They confessed that on the night of November 12 last year, they ganged up with their fugitive accomplice, Li Desheng from Tianjin, and used weapons to rob the home of Chen Lifang, a Ningbo native, at 27 Lane 492, Kangti Road in the French Concession. They stole three gold rings, a gold watch, a men's overcoat, a women's overcoat, five fur coats, and a camel hair robe, which they divided, sold, and spent. The three criminals also confessed that they planned to rob a certain family at 12 Zengfuli, Fulili Road. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the same detectives took the robbers to 9 Chenyuli, Kangti Road, and arrested their accomplice, Li Desheng (35 years old) from Tianjin. He was taken back to the police station for detention and interrogation. As all the criminals confessed to ganging up with weapons to commit robbery, showing no respect for the law, they were instructed to transfer the confessions and evidence of the four robbers to the Second District Court of the Special District this morning for prosecution according to law.</p>
<p>Municipal Zoo</p>
<h3 id="e142">Goldfinch and Skylark Competition to Be Held in Early Spring <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>=Competition Rules Submitted to the Bureau of Education for Approval Before Registration=</p>
<p>=Aquarium Actively Being Planned, Animal Enclosure Construction Nears Completion=</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road in our city held the hibiscus competition at the Minjiao Hall on December 10th of last year, it has aroused the interest of people in society. The zoo is preparing for goldfinch and skylark competitions, which are scheduled to be held in early spring. The construction of the new leopard, bear, and giant animal enclosures is nearing completion. An aquarium is also planned. Details are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Goldfinch and Skylark Competition <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The goldfinch belongs to the yellowbird family (also known as the gold finch or bamboo leaf green), and its color and shape are similar to the hibiscus bird. The difference is that its feathers are slightly mixed with black. There are "lotus" and "peach blossom" varieties, and its song can be appreciated in early spring, but there are fewer people raising them than hibiscus birds, and they are worth 100 or tens of yuan. China is the largest producer. Skylarks are mostly raised by the middle class. The zoo has started preparing for the above two kinds of songbird competitions. After the competition rules are submitted to the Bureau of Education for approval, the registration process will begin. It is scheduled to be formally held in early spring. However, the situation of the skylark competition in the future is complicated, so the rules must be strict to prevent unexpected events.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Animal Enclosure Construction Nears Completion <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The zoo's giant animal enclosure was originally divided into lion, tiger, leopard, and bear enclosures, connected together. At that time, due to insufficient funds, and in response to requests from various sectors, it was opened in advance, so only the lion and tiger enclosures were available, and the leopard and bear enclosures were temporarily placed in iron cages. As a result, a black bear escaped from its cage one year due to broken iron nails. To avoid danger, the zoo specifically requested the Bureau of Education to allocate funds for additional construction to ensure safety. The Bureau of Education approved this, and then requested the Bureau of Public Works to invite bids for construction. To date, two-thirds of the entire project has been completed. The giant animal enclosure is constructed purely of steel and reinforced concrete and should be completed by the end of this month. The remaining leopard and bear iron cages will be used to house other animals. The tropical animal room is now open in the morning and evening to provide heating.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Establishment of an Aquarium <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The zoo currently has various animals, all of which are land and air creatures. However, due to the location of the zoo, aquatic animals such as fish and shellfish have not been actively established. In order to complete the necessary facilities for the zoo and to increase the public's knowledge and interest, the zoo plans to designate a portion of the open space in the zoo to be used as a small-scale aquarium. Since the collection of specimens began, in addition to the transfer of some animals from the original experimental elementary school, the number of donations from private individuals has been particularly large. The new building for the specimen room will be built after the land west of the zoo has been purchased at a price.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Pavilions for Resting <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Although the zoo is small, its internal facilities can be described as perfect. However, the lack of pavilions for visitors to rest is regrettable. Director Shen Xiangrui of the zoo, recognizing that visitors have nowhere to take shelter when the weather is hot or when it is windy and rainy, vacated a space east of the office and built two pavilions, which have been completed and will serve as a place for visitors to rest.</p>

<p>Guomin News reports that Lin Guoxian (40 years old), Fu Yanxuan (33 years old), Fu Songyan (19 years old), Fu Shangyan (31 years old), and Chen Kexuan (42 years old), all from Dalingshao, Sannei, Qingtian, Zhejiang, each failed in business ventures abroad last year. Recently, they went to Korea to visit friends but were unsuccessful, resulting in the exhaustion of their travel expenses and no means of food and lodging. They were forced to ask the Chinese Consulate in Busan for assistance. Consul Chen Zushen interrogated the five men and, after confirming their situation, sent staff to purchase boat tickets and send them back home. He also sent a letter to Director Wen Hong'en of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrange for their resettlement. It is heard that Lin Guoxian and the other four men arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The bureau sent section chief Yin Guanzhi of the relief section to open a room at the Oriental Hotel in Xiaodongmen to provide food and lodging. They will wait to board the China Merchants Bureau's Guangji steamship to be sent to the Wenzhou Public Security Bureau for transfer back to their original residences.</p>
