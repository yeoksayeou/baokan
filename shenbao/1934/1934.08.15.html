<h3>中東路買賣會議破裂敬</h3>
<p>中東路買賣會議。自去年六月下旬在東京開始以來。卽若斷若續。日方旣不肯誠意出資購買。蘇聨亦不便隨意放棄。是以長在遷延之中。迄無解决之望。自日本佔我東北全境以後。在吉黑邊境屢與蘇聨發生直接衝突。此種衝突。一旦爆發。足以演成遠東戰爭。而爲世界第二次大戰之導線。是以日蘇雙方皆嚴行戒備。而日本尤蓄意挑釁。故在中東路沿線。屯駐重兵。大興安嶺各要塞建築堡壘穆陵河一帶。建築軍事工程。此外復有添築北滿。三線之計劃。以期支解中東路。而制其死命。所謂三線者。卽（一）吉林境内沿牡丹江至佳木斯之鐵路。已鳩工亻築。（二）自敦化至海林線。亦將積極着手。（三）黑龍江境内之洮昻鐵道。擬充分利用。並延長齊克路以至於黑河。日人之計劃而成。則中東路將由三叚而剪作五段。經濟與軍事上之價值。皆將頓形减少。據日方宣傳。上述各路線。槪歸南滿鐵道公司一手包辦。乃出於經濟的需要而興築。以期吸收東北之全部農産。由大連而出口。惟考其内幕。則築路之舉。莫非由軍部操縱。受關東軍司令官之指揮。其經濟上之價值。實居其次耳。吾人試再參照日人最近完成敦圖鐵道之急切。益知其主要之着眼點。不在於經濟而在於軍事也。　　不寗惟是。日軍進據吉黑後復借剿滅義勇軍之名强行利用中東路。運輸其士兵軍需。以致該路不克如常經營。蘇聨知事態之嚴重。而爲緩和空氣計乃提議出售該路。冀免戰爭危機之加深。其實蘇聨亦深知日本有意强取。决無成交之望。蓋日人以爲該路已爲囊中之物。將來戰爭發生。無須絲毫報償。卽可唾手而得。奚必先出代價。故所謂中東路之買賣會議。根本爲一滑稽舉動。而况日本復隨時利用僞滿關係。欲使蘇聨於事實上承認僞組織。結果乃使買賣會議更形棘手。　　頃者。日外相廣田竟宣言不再擔任調停之責。此後關於中東路交涉。應由蘇（滿）直接談判。今姑不論蘇聨對此提議决難同意。卽論所謂（滿洲國）也者。舉世皆知其爲日本傀儡。其當交涉衝要之大橋八郎名爲僞國外次。實則仍受東京參謀本部外務省拓務省之指揮。可見廣田之謝絶調停。特具一種威脅性質。催促蘇聨爲實際之讓步而已。然以實力雄厚之蘇聨。非有特殊交換條件。豈肯輕於示弱。　　現在中東路之買賣會議。旣因廣田之辭謝調停而至於完全停頓。而雙方在吉黑沿邊之軍事佈置。復日益緊張。一若戰禍之爆發可以立至也者。顧吾人早知會議决裂。爲不可避免之事實。故不欲過事張皇。謂此事之結果。卽將引起日俄之戰禍。且敢斷言。在國際形勢尚未發生重大變化以至於世界衝突各方形成輪廓顯明之兩大壁壘前。日俄兩國尚不致捲入戰爭之旋渦。且就日本之内部言。亦有其特殊之困難。如東北境内未能安定。懷遠至索倫鐵道二站至黑河鐵道。葉柏壽至承德鐵道。猶未完成。經濟危機。日臻深刻。皆足使其格外愼重。是以日蘇關係因中東路買賣會議之停頓而更形惡化則有之。謂其行將戰爭。則尚嫌言之過早也。俄入國聨</p>

<h3>讀（翻譯本的錯誤和</h3>
<p>疑難）（四續續十一日）　　問：三七八頁第七行（達爾米多）何義？　　答：原文爲Tarmidor，係由法文轉用過來的名詞、原意爲（二月），係指法國二月革命，二月革命推翻拿破崙帝制，復興了民主政體，所以（達爾米）又有民主復興的意味。　　問：三八四頁第五行（因爲法則反映在諸關係的總體中在矛盾中發展的現象之本質的關係一句不能澈底解出。　　答：這句話可以這樣譯：因爲法則反映那在諸關係的總體中依矛盾而發展的現象之本質的關係。　　問：三八四頁第八行：（…由附條件的境界所分離）何義？　　答：事物與事物不是絶對不同的、不同的只是相對的方面、譬如人和狗是不同的、但是某一方面不同、即人類有理智而狗没有，我們不能因此就説狗和人是絶對不同的、因爲狗和人都是動物，這一點總是相同的、狗和人的不同、是在一定的條件之下不同，所謂（附條件的境界所分離），即指此。　　問：三八五頁八行：（一個本質通過諸現象本質的發展）本質，還有現象中的本，如此好象本質有二個了。　　答：前面的（本質）是名詞，後面的（本質的）是形容詞，不是兩個東西。　　問：四一六頁第七行（假構）何義？　　答：即虚假的構造。　　問：四三四頁第一行（與件）何義？　　答：（與件）意即（已存在的條件）或現成的條件。　　問：四六五頁末二行爲什麽（最適應的有機體反而滅亡，不怎樣能適應的有機體反而生存）？　　答：這是指偶然的個别事件來説的，最適應的個體有時偶然也會滅亡，但如果不從個别的偶然事物來説，而從生物全體來看時，這一句話自然是不能成立的，那時，最適宜者一定是（必然地）能够生存。　　問：五一四頁第一行（桑軟性）何義？　　答：即（能變化自如）之意。　　問：五一四頁末行至五一五頁第一行（也會務力於（一切媒介上）去把捉對象）何義？　　答：我們不能把對象看做死的，所以要推移變化方面去把握，一件事推移而成别一件事，其中間即有一種媒介性。所以説要從媒介上去把握。　　問：五一八頁末四行（從偶然的現象形態解放這個過程）請詳爲一解。　　答：即不要把這過程單只看做偶然的現象，而須從偶然現象中找出過程的本質的必然的規律。　　問：五一八頁末四行（類緣）何義？　　答：互相類同，互相因緣，則諸現象的互相關聨。　　問：五三九頁第四行（雖則個個人而存在的人一般的規律性本身，是不存在的請解釋。　　（雖）字是離字之誤。（完）</p>

<h3>趨時和復古</h3>
<p>— 康伯度</p>
<p>半農先生一去世，也如朱湘廬隠兩位作家一樣，很使有些刊物熱閙了一番。這情形。會延得多麽長久呢，現在也無從推測。但這一死，作用却好像比那兩位大得多：他已經快要被封爲復古的先賢，可用他的神主來打（趨時）的人們了。</p>
<p>這一打是有力的，因爲他旣是作古的名人，又是先前的新黨。以新打新，就如以毒攻毒，勝於搬出生鏽的古董來。然而笑話也就埋伏在這裏面。爲什麽呢？就爲了半農先生先就是一位以（趨時）而出名的人。</p>
<p>古之青年，心目中有了劉半農三個字，原因並不在他擅長音韻學、或是常做打油詩，是在他跳出鴛蝴派，駡倒王敬軒，爲一個（文學革命）陣中的戰鬥者。然而那時有一部分人，却毁之爲（趨時）。時代到底好像有些前進，光陰流過去，漸漸將這謚號洗掉了，自己爬上了一點，也就隨和一些，於是終於成爲乾乾淨淨的名人。但是，（人怕出名猪怕壯），他這時也要成爲包起來作爲醫治新的（趨時）病的藥料了。</p>
<p>這並不是半農先生獨個的苦境，舊例着實有。廣東舉人多得很，爲什麽康有有獨獨那麽有名呢，因爲他是公車上書的頭兒，戊戌政變的主角，趨時；留英學生也不希罕，嚴復的姓名還没有消失，就在他先前認眞譯過好幾部鬼子書，趨時；清末，治樸學的不止太炎先生一個人，而他的聲名，遠在孫詒讓之上者，其實是爲了他提倡種族革命，趨時，而且（造反）。後來（時）也（趨）了過來，他們就成爲活的純正的先賢。但是，晦氣也夾庇股跟到，康有爲永定爲復辟的祖師，袁皇帝要嚴復勸進，孫傳芳大帥也來請太炎先生投壺了。原是拉車前進的好身手，腿肚大，臂膊也粗，這回還是請他拉，拉還是拉，然而是拉車屁股向後，這里只好用古文，（嗚呼哀哉，尚饗）了。</p>
<p>我並不在譏刺半農先生曾經（趨時），我這里所用的是普通所謂（趨時）中的一部分：（前驅）的意思。他雖然自認（没落），其實是戰鬭過來的，只要敬愛他的人，多發揮這一點，不要七手八脚，專門把他拖進自己所喜歡的油或泥裏去做金字招牌就好了。</p>
<h3>大衆語文學史的追溯（下）</h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>章太炎先生在論國風用韻的一篇文章裏説：（今時戲曲，直隸有京腔，山西有梆子腔，安徽有徽調，湖北有漢調、四川有渝調，江西有弋陽調，雖各省方言，彼此異撰，而戲曲則無不可以相通，大槪皆以官音爲正，特其節奏有殊，感人亦異，此所以各成其腔調也。）這樣説來，在近代中國的統一國語運動史上，戲曲佔了首功。幾年前有人提倡劇體散文，我也贊成他這一見解，因爲劇曲裏的説白，自成一體，自然活潑，直捷了當，尤其是丑白一項，滑稽幽默，耐人玩味。原來我們的舊戲所以至今還能支持一下，除了牠的調調兒外，就在牠的説白能够使大衆了解，使大衆欣賞。尤其是揷科打輝的丑角，出來説説笑話，開人脾胃。我以爲眞正老牌國貨的幽默白話文，還是要從舊戲裏面去選。實在説起來，舊戲裏面所用的語言文字，原是大衆的，不過牠所代表的意識却是封建意識。這是提倡大衆語文學的人應該知道的。</p>
<p>此外，如花鼓，攤簧，彈詞，寳卷，歌謡，諺語，以及其他時調小曲，連環圖畫，小本小説等等，都是大衆的讀物，或是歌唱講説的東西，很值得有人搜集，整理，研究，批判。總之，我們要建設大衆語文學，對於過去用大衆語寫作的東西，以及目前的白話文學作品，各地流行的大衆讀物歌曲，都有清算的必要。要從許多方面吸收可以帮助自己生存發展的養料，一個新生命纔可成長，纔不至於短命，這是我們努力建設大衆語文學的人應該注意的！</p>
<h3>痛苦</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>痛苦於我是熟客。</p>
<p>在日里，當人間響起了生命的歡笑的時候，我笑，我滔滔地談着話，我也會跟着年青的伙伴們做着青春的潑辣的玩樂。然而當黑夜帶着星星蒞臨的時候，我却會跌在痛苦的深淵，不能自拔。一把痛苦的鉗緊咬着我的心，生命於是浮出了暗影。</p>
<p>在無知的童年，人是不認識痛苦的　一到人生在生命史上踐踏，從沙漠的旅途上蹀　歸來的時候，歷史便帶了智識的禮物，人間的黑暗面便像一塊巨石般壓碎我的心。</p>
<p>在（罪與罰）和（滅亡）中我看到痛苦的二個面相，在其他的書里我也不住地和痛苦握手。陀斯妥夫斯基的憔悴的面孔顯現在我的眼前，在和巴金先生晤面時我也看穿那個抱着巨大的痛苦的心。（罪與罰）的主人公的深刻的痛楚是深深地剌着我的心的，杜大心的滅亡也使人流涙悵惘。</p>
<p>似乎覺得託爾斯泰老年的出亡是應該的，便是莫泊桑的瘋狂的喪亡也屬勢所必至。</p>
<p>於是在十七歲的童年，我開始哭着人生的灰色，一陣光明的破滅又使我的心戮上了鋼針。在赤道的神秘的黑夜，我常常爲熱帶的野犬的吠聲所驚醒；而在灰黯的故國，夜晚的失眠也使我深深地嘗着痛苦的味道。咬着手臂流血，似乎感到一陣痛苦的快樂；在人吃人的社會里，被壓迫者的悲哀暫時除咬破嘴辱之外，也没有可以打遣這刹那的深刻的痛楚的方法。</p>
<p>然而我却又讀到了（鐵流），郭如鶴的緊咬着牙關預備衝出血路的姿態深深地使我感動。這種姿能使我覺悟到過去的流涙的可恥，而痛苦便從此換上了另一個面相。</p>
<p>也靜靜地緊咬着牙關，忍受着歷史和運命所給與我的苦楚；在黑夜的星星閃爍之下，我失眠在床上遠望着那光明的未來。這是我現在痛苦的形相。</p>
<p>相信着：通過了深刻的痛苦，掙扎在生命的道上，光明是總會緊接着黑暗而來的。</p>
<h3>自遣</h3>
<p>— 胡今虚</p>
<p>春天担憂着花朶憔悴，秋天担憂着明月殘褪。潦倒的詩人喲，生命原是一粒泡沫，莫學盲羽的飛蛾撲向紅燄。清閑是無上的幸福呵，任他花朶是垃圾，明月是泥團呢。</p>
<h3>搬家</h3>
<p>— 石耶</p>
<p>不多幾天之後，我要搬家了，從這一住一年零三個月的敦和里搬走。</p>
<p>搬家是件極普通的事，似乎不值得來寫幾行文字，但在我，却有一些感懷，一些悲哀。</p>
<p>我搬到這裏來，是在去年的五月裏。那時候前妻紫英還在，但已經病得很深，是走進一條弄堂已經要喘氣的人了。當她搬進這敦和里就説不好，怪我找錯了房子，我當時無話可説。她也終於説不出眞正不好的理由來。一個多月以後，她就回到四面皆海的故鄉去，結果是死在那裏。</p>
<p>紫英得病之由，是於一二八戰事。我們原先住在横浜路，戰事一起，適當第一道火　，於是不得不設法逃走。可是，不幸，住在我家中的她的弟弟，因爲年輕無知，有些膽大却失落在戰區裏了。她日夜爲之憂急，終於得了不治之症。等到戰事將平，我們因爲住居無地，不得已回到漢口老家去。前年九月再到上海時，她已瘦得祇剩一把骨頭了，誰知她的弟弟却早於戰事平時安然出險，而她，反而因爲他，做了犧牲了。</p>
<p>當現在，將要離開這裏時，我想起了這些。</p>
<p>據説搬一次家等於洗一回澡，剪一次髮那樣，可以使人振作一下，當眞這樣，這倒是欣喜的事，但又令我再想起了一件事來。</p>
<p>是在七年之前，還在大學的時候。寒假放了，同學們已紛紛回籍，而我因爲家中欵項不到，連校役的酒錢都付不出，祇好呆在校裏。同房的思蒓也和我同樣的情形。終於，兩個人在一個嚴寒的冬早，向校役説明了緣由，每人一肩行李，拖了冬日短短的影子，搬到校外半里路的（綠屋）去住，當時踏在氷凍的路上，兩個人一前一後的走着，看看四野枯黄，的確引起了一些凄凉。——這也是搬家。</p>
<p>搬到（綠屋），兩人同時宣告（新生），却不知怎樣一來，反而比以前理加頽廢了下來。住了半年，最後又像逃一樣的搬了出來。</p>
<p>再想到前年回到上海，從一位朋友那裏拖了刧後餘燼的東西，預備重新做一個家時，心中也有些異樣。——這又是一次搬家。</p>
<p>生命好像即在這搬來搬去之間慢慢地消磨。搬家好像是平淡，但在當事者的個人每每是一種換幕，換句話説，就是那一幕完了，等再一幕拉開來時，又將是另一番的情形了。</p>
<h3>施茶</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>老人（四）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>當着他用力地吸着，那霉濕的氣味刺激着他的鼻子，打了一個大噴嚔，眼涙都流了下來。他喊着他的孫子，把他扶到椅子上坐下。</p>
<p>他閉了眼睛，讓精神稍稍得到一點蘇息，可是如果這個時候他的耳朶裏嗡嗡地響了生人的語音，他就會立刻跳起來，揉着眼睛，順着主顧的手指所指着的物件看去，滔滔地起始着記在心中爛熟的關於那物件的故事。</p>
<p>但是他自己已經活到了七十四歲的年紀，也是陳舊得如他的貨品一樣在别人的嘴裏該有一串美妙動人的故事。或者是没有一個人對他有高深的興趣，因爲他是那麽老得使人厭氣的老頭子，孤獨而無味地活着。</p>
<p>他的孫子沙夏——他那個唯一的助手，——也在兩年前偷偷地離開他了。留給他的短簡中，有着這樣的一句話：（我的走是爲了不願意把我的青春埋在這破舊的氛圍之中。）這使得他這個老年人，氣得只有發抖的分。</p>
<p>（破舊的氛圍，破舊的氛圍，）他的嘴喃喃地説着，（你可是從這破舊的氛圍裏面長大起來的！你走到任何的地方去，上帝的眼睛總會看了你，把你埋葬到土裏去吧，埋葬到海洋裏去吧！）</p>
<p>他可是這樣子兇很地詛咒着了。</p>
<p>從這以後，他就只是一個人，早晨要他自己爬起床來打開門，到晚間還林他親手把門鎖好。窗櫉間的那方大玻璃，自從那年青的小夥子走後，就未曾擦拭過，上面是罩了一層如霧的污物。</p>
<p>時常他也想念着那個離開他的小夥子，自然他眞是需要一個人的帮助，除開這個原因之外，還有就是不是用嘴説得出來的一點親情，使他總不能忘記。</p>
<p>在昨天，他拿了一件舊上衣，還加上了多少好話，換來了一瓶渥得加和兩塊烤小牛肉，喘着一口氣，坐到自已的圈手椅裏；那時候，他就突然間想起了漂流在不知何處的孫子。他想着如果沙夏在這裏一定會更有趣味一點吧。他記起來沙夏的歌唱和跳舞，（從前他可是覺着沙夏唱得他頭昏，跳得他腦子漲過的）他懷念着他在這個過年的日子是不是也能痛痛快快地喝一晚上酒？</p>

<h3>最近之改革（下）</h3>
<p>（乙）中學文理分科問題河北省之高中、有分文理科辦理者、而此次高中會考、並不分科、學文科者、仍須考理化、學理科者仍須考史地、以致有三分之一學生、因此未能及格、以是有人主張應仍採分科考試辦法、查高級中學（即前此普通科）不得分文理兩科、此制行之業已多年、前據少數省市呈報有一部份高中普通科分文理科等情到部、均早經本部令飭糾正、　　（丙）會考與升學關係各方對於高中會考及格之學生、不能免試升入大學、頗多非難、此種見解誠有理由、會考及格者得免試升學、在法蘭西等國亦有先例、惟中國中等教育與高等教育、目前尚只在初步整理時期、以會考代替升學考試、即令此制本身爲完善的制度、亦斷非一步可躋、蓋現時普通中學辦理不善者太多、會考及格標凖、只能逐漸提高、在此初期勢不得不從實規定（依現制有一門或兩門不及格者尚得投考升學、惟仍須補考、）因此一部分之會考及格者、按其天資、或教育根底、仍有不能深造之青年、如一律許其入大學、即令全國大學有此容量、於彼等個人或社會未必有益、故天資太低或家境貧苦之子弟、便不宜入普通中學而應升入高級或初級職業學校、然欲達到此種日的則非前節所言、設法添設優良職業學校、限制中學之擴充不可、此亦非二三年之嚴重努力、不能奏效且目前專科以上之學校、師資與設備亦多不及標凖、辦理完善者爲數甚少、高中畢業生之招考、大部集中於少數學校此少數學校無論如何擴充其容量、决不能容納全部投考學生、故爲補救計、應亟設法嚴督各專科學校、一律努力改善、其基礎稍優者政府開經予以經濟的援助（中央最近設立私立專科以上學校之補助費亦即以此、）蓋必如此、若干年後、高中畢業生可望俱有比較完善之學校可升、</p>
<h3>（丁）學生成績與辦學效率關係</h3>
<p>全考之制、本爲提高中學程度曁考核辦學效率而設、説者又謂學生成績與辦學效率、不可混爲一談、學生成績劣者、或係學生天資關係、不宜認爲辦學效率低劣、其實學生天資、固有不同、有資質過劣不堪造就、學校雖多方善誘仍無相當效果者、故常謂成績尋常之學校中其優等生之才力反過於成績優良學校中之普通學生、後者之劣等生又遠不如前者之普通學生、即爲明證、唯天資極高與極低、僅限於少數學生、一校中有數百學生、數百學生之中或有少數人因天資關係、雖經校方努力、成績仍不能及格、但其大多數學生成績之能否及格全視學校辦學效率之高低而定、蓋大多數學生、均係中材、（所謂常模Norm是也）其天資旣不超特、亦不低劣、當然受校方努力與否之影響、綜之、吾國現時中等教育、雖有種種弱點、爲吾人所不滿、倘舉國人士能繼續增加其注意、不斷爲細密之討論、中央及地方政府、對於改革方案之守施能持久不斷、吾人敢信二三年後、全國中等教育必改易其面目、未始不可爲民族復興運動前途之一大助力、（完）</p>

<h3>白桐油漲跌不定之原因</h3>
<p>漢市全由洋行操縱　　油商已失主宰地位　　白桐油時漲時跌、極免起鶻落之能事、蓋漢市已爲洋行所操縱、各油行均須仰其鼻息、故洋莊價格之上落、以及客貨之開盤、自非觀察洋行風色不可、油行家已失其之主、太阿倒持、由來已漸、且各洋行尚在各産地設莊採辦、所以漢市在歷史上雖爲集中市塲、然至現在、亦僅局部而已矣、當此内銷不振時代、全賴洋莊交易、以點綴市面、則洋行更得藉以左右市情、因内情旣爲對手方所深悉、而擒縱之間、更自易易也、歷觀市價漲至三十元以上、則各洋行必束手停辦、待跌至二十八元光景、洋莊交易又見以此　　經過、　　不爽、近數月來之過程、農不能例外、凡從事斯業者、均能以此推斷、在前週漢市售洋莊已跌至二十八元四角、旋因洋交轉旺、即繼漲增高、加至三十元稍零、而近日又見沉寂、據前昨漢訊、已見小鬆、售開二十九元八角、恐洋交不勁、再跌幾何、應在預料之中、若跌至二十八元稍外、則形勢又欲變爲活潑矣、浙江桐油亦隨同進退、故每担市價亦在二十六七元之間、輾轉盤旋而已、但聞川湘鄂各産地存積已薄、或因此發生特别變化、亦未可知、</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>過了四五分鐘，聰明的太后立刻就想出了一種捕救的方法來了，於是伊就親自指揮那些太監，怎樣反所有的木架子重新裝過，怎樣用綵綫絡上去，使每一件古玩或玉器都能安如泰山一般。待到我們的火車用着像牛步一樣快的速度望在津前進的時候，一切東西都完全弄好了。但是我們畢竟還忘掉了一樣東西，就是那小朝廷的四角上的四個花瓶。因爲它們底下的木架子是紅木製的，而且打得非常光滑，再加瓶底也是很光滑的，於是那四個花瓶，受了列車行動的影響，便像生了腿一樣，逐漸在自由行動了；一些一些的滑出來，到底有兩個是吊下來了。太監們一見，忙來不及的搶過去，把那没有吊下來的兩個先扶住了，更造化的是那兩個已吊下來的也没有打碎，理由是底下舖着的那張絨氈，委實是太厚了。不過我當時雖以花瓶未碎爲幸，但後來一轉念間，又怕那花瓶裏的污水，反把這可貴的絨氈沾污了急走過去一瞧，天幸也不曾沾污，這是因爲瓶裏盛的水原是很少的緣故。</p>
<p>瓶和氈雖然都得幸告無恙，但我們所受的一塲虚驚，已是不小了。於是大家忙再把旁的一切東西，逐件的加以第二次的檢騐和紥縛，希望能够藉此一勞永逸，免得再受同樣的驚嚇。</p>
<p>這樣，我們的長途旅行便正式開始了。可是作者的一支秃筆，却還不能隨車進發，因爲我在上文中，雖已把這列御用火車上的各色乘客，－上至太后，下至廚夫僕婦。－全描寫過了，但還遺漏了一位極重要的人物。論他的地位，簡直僅稍次於太后，以我們和他比較，眞有些相形見絀。那末。他是誰呢？原有太后的一頭愛犬，它也有一個名字，一個很威武的名字，喚做（海龍）；其實海龍是怎樣的一種動物，誰也不曾見過（一○五）</p>
<h3>從軍歌</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>在三十餘年前，那時我祗七八齡光景，頂上還留着一條紅綫作結的小辮子。每逢一放夜學，便約的幾個小伙伴，掮着木棍短棒，作兵操的遊戲，嘴裏還唱着這樣的一隻軍歌：</p>
<p>進兮進兮！進進進進進！誰謂黄人，大夢猶未醒？死兮不退，好個壯男兒。爲國爲家，爲我衆蒼生。</p>
<p>這歌雄壯沉着，唱起來眞是振人心志。還有一隻比前首來得激昻嘹亮，可惜後半已遺忘了！把記得的錄在後面：</p>
<p>天下雄，丈夫爭戰功；天下樂，英雄破敵國。古今來，興滅本無常，你看他，强吞弱者肉。……</p>
<p>講到這兩首軍歌的流行民間；琅琅於衆小兒的口内，倒也有小小的一段搶桑。原來這時正當甲午敗後，朝廷派王大臣出洋考察新政，思欲變法自强，除了頒佈憲政外；還推行征兵制度，各地青年，自願入伍的不少。他們穿了洋式的操衣，把辮子盤在頂心，帶上軍帽，倒也着實威武。比起原有的綠營兵，頭上纏着黑布，身穿羽紗勇字戰褂，足登黑布快靴，自覺氣象一新。這兩首軍歌，便是當年這些新兵們唱的，我們兒童很富摹倣性，自然一學就會了。不過那些徴兵們的壽命很短，因爲他們瞧不起綠營兵的腐敗；而綠營兵也受不住他們的架子，同駐一地，常常因細故而發生械鬥。那時的朝廷，終於是不歡喜新式，所以便把他們解散，而這兩首的軍歌，還深深的鐫刻我們腦間。</p>
<h3>不相稱的生活</h3>
<p>— 顔</p>
<p>阿菊在紗廠裏作工，終年穿綢着絹，絲襪革履，美好若小家碧玉。可是伊於衣服雖如此講究，而於食與住，則十分簡陋。不論吃飯吃粥，總是兩塊蘿蔔乾，或一包油黄豆，從不肯買些許好菜佐餐，住的灶披間，敗床破被，簡直像卑田院裏，厚於衣而薄於食住，　伊生　　　　　　稱格了。</p>
<p>李先生在弄堂小學當教員，月入十六金。阿松在汽車公司服務，月入二十金。他們所入雖區區，可是洋其裝，革其履，居然像一位小資産階級。講到他們的食與住，那也可笑極了。李先生實行廢止早餐，中飯在校裏吃，晚上歸來自炊，燒一鍋飯吃幾天，燒一條鹹黄魚也吃幾天，不吃黄魚，則兩枚銅板的豆腐，也一頓飯下咽了。阿松不會燒飯，每飯上小飯館，豆腐湯黄豆湯，是他最經濟的下飯菜。住則兩人都是和友人合住亭子樓，房裏的簡陋齷齪，簡直令人見了不敢走進去。總之，以他們身上的漂亮光潔，誰都料不食到與住是這樣的馬虎。</p>
<p>吳先生大腹便便，住的是洋房，進出是汽車，吃的是洋菜，一切所需，無不享受盡了現代的物質文明。這樣的新人物，誰都料他必有新思想，幹些新事業，可是他不許兒女入校讀書，祗請了個老學究在家教他們四書五經；兒女的婚姻，也要由他作主。他個人則喜歡和尚道士，何處造廟，他肯捐一千或八百，何處塑菩薩，他肯捐神袍一件，何處建法會舉行賽會，他肯爲發起人或贊助人。至於救災救國，及一切社會上慈善事業，則誰都無能力去説到他施捨一文錢。他生活之不相稱，眞是到了極點了。</p>
<h3>小狗</h3>
<p>— 天哉</p>
<p>不是（狗咬呂洞賓，弗識好人心）的惡狗，也不是（摇頭擺尾）百求乞的走狗，更不是（只重衣衫弗重人）的勢利狗，小狗是一個可憐的失學的小孩子的名字，這誠實而聰明的孩子，誰都會同情他，憐憫他。</p>
<p>他在七歲時就死掉了爸的，現在只賸下了他和他的仁慈的媽。生活逼迫着無依無靠的母子倆，於是他的媽做帮傭，小狗做小販來度日。</p>
<p>天氣熱到了一百零四度，太陽的光芒，直照上大地，人們伏在家裏嚷熱。小狗却拿了十五個銅子做本錢，提了一隻破籃子，一根鐵捧，在亮而滑，熱而軟的柏油路上賣冰，汗流下來把小褲子都濕透了，嘴裏還喊着（賣冰呵）。這小朋友也許比許多大朋友苦嗎？</p>
<p>這幾天不知他從那裏學來了（……彼其受之天也，如此其賢也。不受之人，則爲衆人。今夫不受之天固衆人，又不受之人，得爲衆人而已耶？）幾句話。他賣掉了冰獨自喃喃的，反覆的吟着。雖然他自己不解其意，可是我想起了王安石的一篇（傷仲永），不禁暗暗裏替他傷心。</p>
<p>（小狗，賣冰的小狗。）我腦海中時常刻著這種印象。</p>
<h3>和平神的悲哀</h3>
<h3>猴戲</h3>
<p>— 流沙</p>
<p>炎毒的太陽下，把大鑼大鼓打起來。滿頭滿臉生着火庘子的頑皮孩子們，像一溜烟，也像一久潑出了的水，全部都望着打鑼的地方奔去啦。孩子們的年紀雖小，對於這種鑼聲却是頗具一點經騐，他們稚幼的心裏早知道這准是爲什麽好看的瞧啦。</p>
<p>孩子們在打鑼的地方圍成了一堵牆，牆裏邊的山東人赤着背，牽出了一個小猴子，猴子翻着白眼，孩子們便高聲笑起來啦。</p>
<p>山東人牽着猴子嚷起來了（小把戲，耍幾套？）一套，兩套，就這麽要起來了，猴子翻着白眼，戴着鬼臉，穿着花衫，跳了，爬了，於是孩子們瘋了一樣地哄起了很大的笑聲，山東人的頭上滾着汗，依然很起勁地嚷着。（小把戲，再要一套。）</p>
<p>可是猴子這下子却違抗主人的命令了，它不跳也不動，好像快要死去一樣地坐在地上。孩子們瞧着猴子不要，漸漸地感着有點兒失望了。但是山東人十分了解這種心理並且利用這種心理，他講：（小把戲要銅板了，没有銅板不要了。）接着山東人便向四圍鞠躬，教猴子也在地上叩頭，（祇要三十個銅板，有了三十個小把戲就願意要。）可是四圍的顧客有的光着屁股，有的穿着小布衫，可是布衫上没有口袋，有的祇有火𤵭子，縱使有一個銅子也得買糖吃，没有那個大量兒，捨不得把要猴子的。</p>
<p>山東人，儘鞠躬，小猴子，儘叩頭，但是没有得着顧客們一個銅片兒。孩子們本來有什麽錢呢？山東人爽然地牽了猴兒走了，孩子們失望得駡出了聲音，（山東人頂古怪哉。）但是山東人的苦衷是那孩子們所不解的。</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>使用氷箱的秘訣</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>氷箱爲夏季内中産階級以上的家庭所必備的，有瓦斯氷箱，電氣氷箱，置氷箱三種，瓦斯電氣氷箱，除有産階級外，中産階級無力置備的。瓦斯氷箱的冷却裝置，先把阿姆尼亞水，用瓦斯加熱，變爲阿姆尼亞瓦斯，這水冷後就會凝縮，再變爲阿姆尼亞水，在壓力低的氣化器中，與水素相混合，急劇氣化，其時從周圍奪去氣化熱，因此箱内的空氣，遂冷，降至零下十度了。電氣氷箱以發動機動活塞，亞把硫酸瓦斯壓縮液化，降至水漕的管中，突然變爲氣體，冷却周圍的空氣，如不用亞硫酸瓦斯，代用阿姆尼亞，瓦斯，鹽化美的爾亦可，至於置氷氷箱，内部構造，非常簡單，大約分爲數種，考究的外層與内層中間，塞以軟木屑，内層或砌磁磚，次等貨，省去磁磚與軟木屑，内層祇用洋鐵皮，洋鐵皮與外層木板間，塞以石棉，炭屑，煤屑，木屑，糠皮等。這種裝置，頗不完備，不但容易溶解氷塊，而且微生蟲亦易於繁殖。本埠北京路虹廟弄霞飛路等處的木器店，所售的氷箱，大抵裝置粗陋！不耐久用的。可是無論那一種氷箱，倘若使用不得其法，就要减少冷藏的能率，難保食品的腐敗，現在我把使用氷箱的秘訣，介紹一下：（一）開閉箱門一開，箱内置氷後，其空氣漸漸冷却，倘若箱門一開，那内部的冷空氣放出，外部的熱空氣流進，箱内的温度，就要上昇了。好比冬季用火爐，一經開門，門内的熱氣流出，外面的寒氣侵入，减低室内的温度一樣的，所以取放食品，應當非常迅速。（二）氷的用量，要有一定，每天需用氷的分量，須斟酌氷箱的大小，譬如普通所用的高三尺闊二尺深一尺三四寸的氷箱，每一晝夜氷的用量，須十五磅内外倘若過於節約，食品難免腐敗，有許多人用毛巾包氷、以爲可以省氷，然而不能保持本來的低温度。（三）氷箱内部常要清潔，氷箱原爲貯藏飲食物之用，應當清潔乾燥，因爲箱内乾燥，冷氣就能强烈的感梁到食品，又每月應用開水洗滌内部，或用肥皂鹹水冲刷，那末庫内受脂肪分的食品沾染部分，也可以脱落了。（四）氷箱内如有氷溶解的水停留，應當天天排除刷凈，因爲這水很不衛生，且要减低冷氣，其漏水的口，亦須常常用竹竿或鐵絲溝通，免得污物微菌積滯其中。（五）普通氷箱内的温度標凖（照上述用氷量計算）爲五十五度，但亦有因貯藏物而不同，亦有低至五十度至四十五度的。可是在這温度内，蟲類微菌亦不會死滅，故須預防蟲類侵入蔓延。預防之法，在箱脚，洒以石炭酸或消毒水。（六）氷箱須放在陰凉地方，廚房内靠近爐竈地方，切不可放。（七）從氷廠送來的氷，並不清潔，應用冷蘇打洗過，揩去濕氣，再用白報紙包裏安放，那就能多保持時間了。（八）齷齪的器具與食物，切不可入箱，譬如未經冼滌清潔的青菜水菓，恐怕帶有微生蟲。（九）天然氷多不清潔，宜用人造氷。（機器氷）（十）如氷凍汽水水果以及其他清凉飲料，切不可放在有油膩的菜肴中。（十一）隔層的氷箱（有二層三層的别）兩側的溝槽，不可置放東西，因爲其空洞，被物遮塞，冷氣不能滲到下面。（十二）箱底漏水管口，要留心污物積留。（十三）大凡生的魚肉獸肉蔬菜，應當先用鹽水洗凈，再入箱内貯藏。（十四）温熱之物：應放在底層，不可與氷塊接近。以上十五項，爲使用氷箱的秘訣，請備用者一一留意。</p>

<h3>送本届出洋生</h3>
<p>— 比</p>
<p>前天本市三十幾個團體在新亞酒樓歡送本届出洋的留學生，第二天據報紙的記載，我們知道那三百多的出洋生得到了許多歡送者熱烈的勸勉鼓勵之詞，並且我們還可以揣測到當時大會席上温暖快樂的空氣，眞呌人替未來的中國抱無限度的樂觀！</p>
<p>這次三百多個出洋生中，我有一個朋友陳君是留美去學法律的，在理，我也應該像報紙上記載的那樣給我的朋友一篇送行的序文，但是那些話，不是我們千篇一律地在每年的報紙上都曾經讀過嗎？况且他又是聽過了的，我再説一遍，不是太累贅麽？</p>
<p>我要説的，簡直呌我送行的人都感到十二分的不樂意，因爲，目前擺着的事實實在呌人不樂意的太多了！個然我很知道在各個出洋生的心中都抱負着一個很大的志願和希望，這些志願和希望，也正如過去出洋的或是出洋已經學成歸國的學生所抱負的一樣，但是過去給我們的答覆，那些回國的留學生并没有給我們若干什麽的功績，據流言的傳説，簡直眞呌人傷心疾首呢！所以，我對於本届的出洋生也因之發生了若干成份的懷疑，而不得不説些呌人不喜歡聽的話了。</p>
<p>過去出洋生犯了一個毛病，就是動機的錯誤。無庸諱言，有許多的青年是在日夜幻夢地要想賺一個美麗愉快的將來，而在這個尚虚不務實的社會裏。出洋又是個時髦出風頭的事兒，所以他們要想抓得他意想中的將來，便成了出人頭地的非到外洋去跑一趟而藉以號召不可了。其次，也有不少的青年，從大學裏畢了業出來，想在這擾亂的社會裏找得一個職業而終於揷不進脚，於是出洋留學，是他惟一過渡現實的方法，横豎大爺有的是錢，到外洋去遊玩一番，何樂而不爲呢？當然還有些慣於享樂的青年，是爲了景慕外洋物質的文明和尊優的生活，而决定去盡量享受一番的，也大有人在。</p>
<p>説起來眞不是够愉快的事，幾十年如一日地，中國什麽事都要仰給外人，天然不能例外，然而出洋留學，已經留了幾十年了，到如今國内還是不多藏着豐富圖書的圖書館，也很少儀器設備完全而能安心一志地專門研究學術的研究院。日本，以前正如中國一樣，每年都要派遣許多的留學生出洋去留學，到了現在，他們的熱度絶對不像中國人這樣時髦和瘋狂了。這不是説，人家不去求學，人家自足自給了啦！這一個比較，豈不呌人慚愧得無以自容？</p>
<p>這幾天正是本届出洋生忙着準備動身手術的時候，正在這時候，我願意這三百多個希望無窮的有爲的青年都有一番憬然的覺悟。第一，把動機要弄得正確清楚些，不要再陷以前的混沌和錯誤了；其次，每個人腦經裏應當有一個（出洋留學并不是怎樣時髦出風頭）的意念，同時要堅定地自信，將來回國來，要把這荒漠得連教育文化亦須仰給外人的祖國，積極地眞實地開拓一下，奮鬥出一個新環境來。</p>
<p>這是我熱烈祝望於本届出洋生的。</p>
<h3>夏日黄昏</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>一隻翠鳥掠過水面，把一片紅霞的映影打破了。</p>
<p>蘆葦受了晚風，沙沙地響。熱未消散，樹枝上幾只知了還在聒噪。</p>
<p>塘堤的一角架着一輛水車，一個英俊的少年赤着脚在踏水，轔轔地，轔轔地。靠着水車，一株柳樹彎彎地趨向水面，幾條小魚在柳條下彼此追逐。一個俊俏的村姑倚着柳樹坐着，無意識地摘着身旁的野草，眼睛瞧着少年，帶着微笑。</p>
<p>歸巢的鳥雀喞喞地從頭上飛過，天漸漸地晚了。少年矯捷地下了水車，伸了伸懶腰，回過身來握着村姑的手，坐了下來，脚垂在水裏，一陣亂踼，驚散了那羣游魚。</p>
<p>兩人互相望着，不聲不響，老是微笑。</p>
<p>水面平靜了，映着兩個人的臉和半個身子。少年把頭附在村姑的耳邊低低地不知説了些什麽，村姑噗哧一笑，轉過臉去，摇摇頭。從少年的手指間抽出一隻手來，理了理耳邊的頭髮，低了頭，含羞地弄着衣角。</p>
<p>少年伸手抱村姑的頭，村姑向樹的那邊躱，脚一伸，水面又起了一陣波動，映在水面上的影子又消失了。</p>
<p>（那是什麽？）村姑向少年的背後努了努嘴。</p>
<p>少年回頭一瞧，什麽都没有。村姑却掙開了他的手，站起來，跑了！</p>
<p>（你這小鬼靈精，我不把你的皮撕下來！）少年發現自己上了當，望着站在一丈以外的她説。</p>
<p>少年站了起來。裝了一個追的姿勢，村姑轉身跑了，停在塘的對岸，格格地笑。</p>
<p>（别閙了，把水車拆下來是正經）！少年説着。</p>
<p>（我不敢過來呀！）</p>
<p>（我又不會喫了你！）</p>
<p>村姑虚心地走了過來，眼睛直望着少年。走到那株柳樹邊，停下了。</p>
<p>（來呀，我一個人怎末拆得下呢）！少年一邊解着架子上的繩子，一邊向她説。</p>
<p>村姑走到水車邊，不提防，二只手又被少年握着了。</p>
<p>（哈哈，這可不讓你跑了！）</p>
<p>天一點點地黑了，知了已不復振翼，遺留着的是一對青年的歡笑。</p>
<h3>戀愛的條件</h3>
<p>— 百喜</p>
<p>從我的一個朋友的日記簿裏，我讀到這麽一段：</p>
<p>（××西服店把我定製的西服送來了，我的心悖動，爲了我的×，我應當穿起西服來。）</p>
<p>雖則寥寥幾個字，可是我們可以推測得出我的那位朋友的所戀愛的對象，是怎麽樣的一位女性來了。</p>
<p>我推測我的那位朋友的所戀愛的對象，定是燙着頭髮，畫着鉛眉，塗的嚥脂在她的櫻桃的小嘴巴上，兩邊的面頰上，白的粉，紅的粉，匀拌着，口丹在手指染成絳紅色，長而緊身的單薄的旗袍下，是一雙穿着高跟皮鞋的光赤着的脚。</p>
<p>這樣一位摩登的姑娘，她挽的男人的肐膊，會是長衫朋友的麽？</p>
<p>摩登姑娘的心目中的（男侍者，）在外表上那身（西服）確是少不了的。</p>
<p>第一，男人先要穿起（西服，）那才有摩登姑娘）的戀愛賜來。</p>
<p>西服，是戀愛的第一個先决條件。</p>

<p>下解放出來，（中國的婦女是受雙重壓迫的），雖則在中國封建餘毒還未全數掃滅，婦女們的呻吟於封建餘毒下的還大有人在，可是一部分的婦女們跟封建餘毒鬥爭，而求得了解放，正可以建立起婦女們的獨有的人格來，但可惜，從封建餘毒下鬥爭出來的婦女們，一接觸到這個（自由放住）的社會，變相的被這個社會束縛着，而換湯不換藥的仍做着男子們的（玩物，）要曉得這身（西服）爲得着你的歡喜而做的，焉知道這身（西服）不是爲了再一個（摩登姑娘）的呢？因爲在這個社會裏，這種（摩登姑娘確是很多很多呢！</p>
<p>咱們這個民族，現在正是危機四伏，（新摩登姑娘）的戀愛的先决條件應該是：</p>
<p>（拯救這個危機四伏的咱們的民族！）</p>
<p>我認爲，最起碼的，這個（戀愛的條件）。</p>
<h3>外婆</h3>
<p>— 比</p>
<p>走過陳媽的門口，終是看見她彎腰曲背着一針一針地在紅綠布上穿來穿去，滿背瘠濕淋淋地尚着汗，忙得什麽也似的。跑過去看看是一件大紅綢的短大褂，長不過八九寸，上面還有自陳媽那額上淌下來的點點汗跡呢。她在加勁地一針針的縫着。</p>
<p>人家都向她這樣的道賀着：（陳媽眞是好福氣，這麽快的做了外婆，好抱外甥了。）可是她老是這樣説：（當眞我是好福氣？不是做（外婆）而是做（裏婆）哪。這樣大熱的天氣誰高興做小孩的衣服，况我的女兒又没有好待我，不過她家裏有大有小，我呌没法，擺過（塲面）瞞過（世人眼）而已。）雖是這樣説，陳媽仍舊繼續做下去。</p>
<p>是去年雪花紛飛的時刻吧！她的女兒瑩文出了嫁。這一回事還分明地在我的記憶中。正是她出嫁的那天我帶了我十歲的小弟弟去吃喜酒，小弟弟看見（花橋）和（小堂名），他睜圓了烏黑的小眼睛張開小嘴向我發着疑問：（姊呀！這麽大的木籠來幹什麽呀！穿着大紅衣服被搶去的又是誰哪！爲什麽又要這麽多的呌化子簇在前面擁在後面呢？）原來在現時代的孩子的腦中，以爲這樣是掠奪的賣買婚姻啦！</p>
<p>瑩文爲着自己的（出閣），足足忙了有五年之久吧！她現在倒底是孩子的母親了。</p>
<p>可是陳媽她那瘦癟的臉兒，現在更顯得消瘦了，手臂如柴一般。親戚們都替這位老太太可憐。</p>
<p>（眞的，祗有要他的老命，此外還有什麽辦法呢？五百元錢的欠欵，况且利息又是那末重，按月要四分錢啦！）媽的房裏聽見另一個人在對媽這麽説。我知道，這分明她們又在談起陳媽的事？。於是去年的一幕，又重浮在我的眼前：</p>
<p>陳媽在她乾癟的臉上浮上的淺淺的苦笑，向放債的人訴説她的苦衷，怎樣地需要錢去替女兒（擺塲面），終於給她借到月利四分的五百元錢來。現在呢，她是做了外婆，也成了熱鍋上一隻衰弱呆笨螞蟻，她痛苦啦！</p>
<h3>夢裏的幸福</h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>躺在牀上，深深的盍着自己的眼睛，緩遲着自己的呼吸，伸直了手脚，彷彿一條白魚放在厨台上面似的，性命不久便被宰殺的啊！</p>
<p>把自己全部的思想集中到腦子上頭，對於自己的前途，是這麽發生了一個懷疑兼感慨的問號？</p>
<p>終於，受了過度的驚懼及憂傷，使我的身子突然抖索起來；臉色鐵青，心驟跳動，呼吸是那麽緊促。</p>
<p>回憶着過去，也許，可以安慰我現在刹那的痛苦，然而，這瞬間的安慰，於我這遍體創痕的人兒，這不是非常短促的嗎？</p>
<p>憧憬着以往的幸福而湧現於此刻的悲哀，這大抵是由我好於幻像的緣故吧</p>
<p>是的，那不可捉摸的過去，固然目前不必去留戀了，然而今朝呢？今朝於我的生命將給以何種的變化？</p>
<p>今朝？——這是多麽的抑鬱，苦悶蝕食了我的身心，衰弱消靡了我的康健，窮窘刧奪了我的幸福，孤寂形成我的煩惱，對於自己理想的追求，使我撲了一個空，我的遭遇使我徒然起了無限的傷心。</p>
<p>自己承認是個富於熱情的人，心裏是充滿了那種激昻和烘灼的欲望，對於世界，并不是一個絶無感覺的化石。</p>
<p>我的企圖很大，我的理想很高，我的欲望很奢，然而社會是多麽的虐待我啊！</p>
<p>設若一個人立志不定，没有刻苦的習慣，没有堅毅的精神，没有生活的目標，這不是很容易爲惡劣的環境所克服嗎？</p>
<p>我呢？是否其中的一員？我——能否戰勝了環境？我是不是應該和環境鬥爭？我是否甘心要墮落？</p>
<p>一串一串的問題，連續地湧現於我的腦海裏。</p>
<p>想到這些，我似乎感覺非常難堪，我的眼裏不覺潤濕了。</p>
<h3>阿大吃冰淇淋阿二喊肚皮痛</h3>
<p>靜穆地又把自己的雙眼緊緊的盍着，努力克服自己内心的紛糾，停止了一切可怕的思想，我非要好好的安睡一會不可呀！</p>
<p>在夢裏，我幻覺着許多許多使自己吃驚的事，彷彿我自己正和一些惡魔厮殺，在英勇的抗爭裏頭，我屢次被那些惡魔所襲擊，挫折，誘惑，威脅，欺詐，……然而，我并没有和牠們妥恊，我并没有爲牠們所敗，在焦頭爛額，鮮血淋漓的塲合裏，我終於靠着自己那種不屈不撓的精神，打退了我的敵人，於是，在無數的人羣中，得着他們的引導和援助，我凱旋了自己自由的家鄉，光明的國度。我非常慶幸自己的幸運，在充滿了指望和熱情中，我向着自己的朋友大呼：</p>
<p>（我已經戰勝了自己的敵人呵！）</p>
<p>（我已獲得可貴的自由了！）</p>
<p>被自己那洪亮的呼喊所驚醒，睜開了疲倦的眼睛，我仍舊地躺在自己的牀上，不覺説了一句：（這是夢裏的幸福呵！）</p>
<h3>光裕山堂</h3>
<p>— 丙心</p>
<p>爲了凉爽，爲了經濟，我和朋友珊搬到鄉下來住了。我們每天快樂的吃着飯，看着書。　　每當夕陽西下，吃過了晚飯的時候。我倆便到寓所附近的光裕山堂去散步，不覺間這塊小小的公墓，便成了我們每天必到的公園了。我們在這裏談着生活，談着愛，談着怎樣做文章，怎樣………</p>
<p>一個夕陽下，吹着凉風的旁晚；我們吃過了晚飯，低聲哼着魚光曲的調子，走進了這個小小園子裏，穿過一條紫藤搭成的甬道，兩邊鋪着茵綠色的青草地。在一層薄薄的青草地上，聳起着一塊塊大理石刻成的墓碑，有大的，有小的。有方的，亦有圓的。在那潔白的大理石墓頭處，採着一朶兩朶，黄的或者是紅的鮮花。在碑的頂處，垂着隨風揑動的紫羅蘭的枝子，小鳥站在樹枝頭，在伴着寂寞的幽靈低奏。</p>
<p>是一種凄凉，沉寂的情調，我坐在一塊墓頭上，冥想着死的自由，死的快樂。假如我死了，亦能埋在這爽靜的所在的園地裏，我想死，我想立刻就死，伴着這一體爽魂同去。</p>
<p>死，那裏是痛苦的，你看那架着雙翅的小天使，不是快樂的欲飛的樣子麽？這裏簡直一點没有恐怖，簡直是所美麗可愛，爽靜而含有詩意的小花園。</p>
<p>珊一聲亦不響，好像亦在冥想着些什麽，我倆相對的沉默着。</p>
<p>茜喲，假使是我的愛人死了，埋在這裏，那我天天要來給她獻朶她平時喜歡的鮮花在這裏。</p>
<p>結果這沉寂是被珊打破了。</p>
<p>（那麽你就隨便選一個你所愛的，未出嫁姑娘的墓，來作你愛人的墓吧！）</p>
<p>我打趣他。</p>
<p>（你看這個不好麽？她的芳名呌李雪芳，芳齡才二十歲呢！）</p>
<p>（啊，她死的時候是二十歲，今年該是二十二，你比她小一歲，快呌她一聲姐姐吧！）</p>
<p>我們倆都感覺到一種特别的心情，會心的笑了。他便眞的站在那墓的旁邊，規矩的鞠了個躬，嘴裏喊了聲（芳姐。）便躺在墓石上睡下了。</p>
<p>唉，人生像演戲，這是一點亦不會假的，居然在這情形下，我們倆個便都落涙了。</p>
<p>天是慢慢的黑下來，淡白色光從東方昇起了，點點的繁星，點綴着這神秘的，凄凉寂寞的夜景，我們才懶　的懷着一種吉斯理的心情走出這　靜的所在，踏上了歸途。</p>

<h3>呆子（七）</h3>
<p>— 林彬</p>
<p>（天呀，秀鳳姑娘不是我的二表妹嗎？）我心裏想。</p>
<p>（不過太兇一點兒。用竹梢打了一頓就得了。何必用紅柴刺？他畢竟是呆子呀！）又是幾乎低得聽不見的聲音。</p>
<p>（你説得好話。三代書家呀！這樣還了得？殺一警百！）</p>
<p>（哈哈，三代書家！）這種微帶諷嘲的淡笑，使我不自覺地想起一年前姑丈的兒子，我的表兄强奸小寡婦的風流案。</p>
<p>（先生一定要結果了他的生命，秀鳳姑娘的媽横勸直勸勸不動他，只得躺在床上唸阿彌陀佛。）一個帮嫂模樣的婦人説了歎一聲氣。</p>
<p>紅柴刺還是不住地抽着，呆子的慘呌聲漸漸低微下去，分不清眼白和眼瞳的糢糊的涙眼漸漸無力地縮小攏來。我的頭腦奔盪着不祥的預感，我知道呆子已踏入另一個世界的邊緣了。這時我的憐憫突然變成了憤恨，胸中燃燒着燎原的怒火，脊背裏傾流着冰冷的顫慄。我不願和姑丈見面了。</p>

<h3>好萊塢惟一有爵士銜的演員</h3>
<p>— 文影</p>
<p>蓋斯丹定昏夜巧遇英王　　漫游世界願終老於影業</p>
<p>這是好萊塢惟一的演員，名字上帶着一個爵士的頭銜的，但他確不是我們所習知的喬治亞理斯。喬治的晋授爵士頭銜，喧傳了好久，但是至今還没有成爲事實。現在的爵士，是一個呌蓋，斯丹定（Sir　Guy　Standing）的英國人。好萊塢許多演員之中，出了這麽一位勳爵，他們亦可引以爲榮了。</p>
<p>蓋。斯丹定爵士的父親，是赫伯德·斯丹定（Herbert　Standing）。他在默片時代亦是銀幕上一位很有名的演員。蓋到了十五歲的時候，就脱離了家庭，自己去尋找生活了。他加入倫敦一個小戲班，薪水是每星期一鎊。他的合同雖然前後不過六個星期，但他已自己决定了他的前程……他立志要做一個演員。後來他許久没有事情做，窮極無聊，就投入海軍，當了四年水手。那還是太平無事的時候，他可以隨便上岸或下水，所以他在此後的四年之中，他有戲可演的時候就上岸，無戲可演就下船。到了十九歲，他的戲劇生活纔算正式開始。他暢游了澳洲和美洲各地。他演的戲，好像一本戲學大全，眞是無所不具。在一九一四年，他和派拉蒙公司簽了一張合同，做了（The　Silver　King）中的主角，但是不多幾天，歐戰就爆發了。他因爲是英國後備義勇團的團員，並且有船長的憑照的，就覺得他盡忠報國的時候到了。他於是就請公司取消合同。公司當然亦就答應了，希望他能於戰事完畢後，立卽回去工作。他於是就馬上拍電到英國海軍部報告回國自効。等到他一到倫敦海軍部，他就立卽被任爲英國海軍副管帶之職，並且要立卽出發到樸資茅登一隻潛水艇驅逐艦上做艦長。自他足踏英國領土，到他上船指揮，前後不過十二個小時云。</p>
<p>不久蓋·斯丹定受傷了，他的膝蓋骨碎裂了。但他不願意退職閒居，就加入了海軍情報局服務。一天晚上，他坐了一艘驅逐艦渡英國海峽。他在黑夜之中，遇見了一個形跡可疑之人。那天晚上，狂風怒號，波濤洶湧，形勢非常險惡，蓋看見了那個形跡可疑之人，在狂風暴雨之中，走向船頭指揮長官室，疑心他是個奸細，就一步上前，把他扭住了，將他面罩拉開一看，嚇了他一大跳。原來那人不是别人，而是英王喬治五世。這位英王因爲少年時，是位海軍官佐，現在雄心未死，趁此月沉天黑之時，私自微服登船，偵察海上情狀也。但是英王很佩服斯丹定的勇敢。於是他們就像一見如故的朋友，在船頭上談了半天海上的情形。斯丹定對答如流，英王尤爲欣喜不置。後來英王回到倫敦，在戰事未告終八個月之前，就加了蓋，斯丹定一個參將的頭銜（Commander　of　British　Empire）。等到戰事告終，英王眷念舊遊，又加了他一個爵士的勳銜Knight　of　the　British　Empire）。於是他的名字上，就平空添了一個Sir字了。</p>
<p>他在戰事告終之後，已經名成業就，就於閒暇之時，漫遊世界。他本來是個演員出身的，如今還歸故業，並且他和派拉蒙，有約在先，他於是就彳亍來到好萊塢。他並不以自己爵位爲重，情願加入了美國的影界，做一個演員。他現在在好萊塢已經住了一年又半，頗有終老此鄉之願。他接連演的片子，已經有八九張之多，大槪以扮演軍官爲多。他有一種别具的威嚴，爲普通演員扮演軍官的不能表示出來的，因爲他曾親率數千健兒，爭雄海上的，所以有獨到之處也。當然他不是一個平常的演員了。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>（漁光曲）和（姊妹花）</h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>我素來並不喜歡看影片，尤其厭惡舶來的什麽（艷史）之類；老實説，我一向對于影片是並没有什麽好感的。可是最近看了姊妹花和漁光曲後，我眞覺到極大的驚異：向來鄙俗歪曲的中國影片，一轉瞬間就會走到這麽一條正大的道路上去，我想這自然是環境驅使之故。</p>
<p>這二部影片都是本年度的影壇傑作，一樣地受觀衆歡迎，這的確是好現象。我們不必太顧重佈景和演出之技巧等，單就這二片的意識方面講，已遠勝于大多數的舶來片了；何况這二片的佈景和演出方面並未見些微的幼稚·我想如果我們有了這麽完善的影片，而我們的同胞還要傾心子舶來的肉腿，狂吻時，那中國眞是没有辦法的了。</p>
<p>漁光曲和姊妹花各有各的長處，以及短處。在演出的技巧方面，漁光曲應該遜于姊妹花一籌的。導演的手法，固然不凡，而演員們也個個能稱職，能努力，表演得非常細膩。末後的一段暢快輕鬆的對白（卽二寳認大寳爲姊時），尤其是姊妹花賣座不衰的一大原因。</p>
<p>但，另一方面，漁光曲新頴的取材，曲折悲苦的情節，偉大的意識，即是駕於姊妹花之上的。</p>
<p>總之，這二部影片是一對姊妹花，如果我們定要分出他們的不同時。那麽（姊妹花）是纒棉細膩的，而（漁光曲）乃是悱惻悲壯的，如此而已。</p>
<h3>范朋克腹背受敵</h3>
<p>— 伏</p>
<p>島格拉斯范朋克，可以算是最不幸的人了，他在英美雙方，都受到了法律的侵擾，可以説是腹背受敵，招架無方了。他和曼麗璧克馥的離婚案，擱置了許久，現在曼麗又在急劇進行之中了。曼麗已經請求了法庭，而得到了法庭的特許，將傳島格拉斯的傳票，刊登在報上，因爲他身在英國，無從派警傳達也。在英國方面。島格拉斯對於（唐王私生活）（The　Private　Life　of　Don　Juan）的攝製，已經功德圓滿。他於是對於久已擱置的一椿被控和姦案不得不開始其辯護工作了。他是被一位英國勳爵名Lord　Ashley的，控告范朋克與其妻和姦oLadyAshley在未嫁之前，本來是位歌女，自從范朋克到了英倫，好就鍾情於他，差不多如形影之相隨，跬步不離了。聽説就是現在，范朋克和那位勳爵夫人，還同遊同息。凡是貴族們邀請范朋克的，亦必須同邀那位勳爵夫人。卽此一端，亦可見他們二人關係的密切了。</p>

<p>法國戲劇家</p>
<h3>贊美（漁光曲）</h3>
<p>— 忠</p>
<p>八月八日本埠法文日報，曾刊載旅滬法國名小説家兼戲劇家的德華爾氏，對該報記者所發表的關於（漁光曲）的一段談話。德氏對于該片，極端贊美。他説；（這片確是精美絶倫。我從來没有看見這樣好的影片。請相信我吧。我是深深地認識法，美，德，俄各國名片的。但覺歐美影片中，没有一張像（漁光曲）這樣富有詩意和偉大的。這眞是一個奇異的收獲。該片映了二小時之久，而没有一分鐘不使我引起深切的趣味。它是一切都美，甚至於謌曲的本身的亦具有絶等的美），西報對於國産的影片，向來是愼重發表意見或加以批評的。這不能不算是中國電影界的光榮吧。</p>
<h3>錢化佛幾乎湼槃</h3>
<p>— 浣薇</p>
<p>（春宵曲）有聲片的男主角錢化佛，二十年前在新劇界頗負盛名，後來抛棄舞臺生活，專門畫佛，馳譽藝林，現在已是年逾半百的老翁了。可是他上銀幕還是第一次，他在劇中飾一個迂謹的小學校長，從鄉間到上海來向教育局領得三千元經費，不幸被一個妖媚的舞女所蠱惑，將三千元竊去，他這一急不但急得一佛出世，簡直要二佛湼槃。</p>
<h3>（萬花團）上銀幕</h3>
<p>曾經在卡爾登表演了一個長時期，哄動了全滬的世界著名馬格斯歌舞班演出的（萬出團），在天一影片公司的攝製之下，從舞台跳上銀幕了。（萬花團）影片在一個靈活的鏡頭的支配之下，那跳動的腿，那超凡的舞藝，那迷人的音樂，那偉大美麗的佈景，那悠揚動聽的歌，這包羅萬象，花團錦簇的（萬花團）的一切的一切，是更清晰，更美麗，更生動的貢獻給觀衆，同時，攝影收音也特别美滿。告訴給期待着看（萬花團）影片的人們，（萬花團）不久就要在上海公映了，請注意着地點與時期吧！</p>

<h3>小娃娃（Baby　Take　A　Bow）（三）</h3>
<p>— 草時</p>
<p>他昨夜曾看着凱製壽糕，把手圍住了她的胸，奪了她的調羹去調麵粉。她的頭偎在他肩頭，臉仰着向他微笑。（快樂嗎？）她問。（憂愁啦，肩上負着三副重擔－妻，兒，以及一個新職務。）他説：（眞是太難爲你了！）凱戲謔地温柔地回答。（職務倒還不錯，）埃第承認。突然他很嚴重的説：（不久我們可以住在我們夢想中鄉間的屋子裏去了。）</p>
<p>那不過是昨天。祗隔了一夜，鄉村小屋的憧憬已破壞了。一切是多麽出乎意料！當史東來時，蕭麗正坐在門前的石級上。那個魔凝視着這小孩子問道：（你是埃第的孩子嗎？）（我不是孩子，我是個小姑娘。今天還是我的生日呢）蕭麗無邪地答復。此時埃第正出來，立即遣去了蕭麗。他冷冷的望着這無賴。史東告訴埃第，他方才幹了一件大賣買，但他因太受注意，無法銷贓。他要埃第做個中間人，代他保管一下。埃第却嚴厲的拒絶了。</p>
<p>史東走後，埃第把這事已丢在腦後。他和勞雷駕着汽車到卡孫家裏。但當他們到了那裏，他們發見惠爾許和佛雷尼根亦在那邊。恐怖便扼住了埃第的心頭。顯然的出了什麽事故了。不久，埃第如道史東所説的賣買，就是在卡孫家裏做的，公司已縣了五千元賞格，這便是惠爾許所追求着的了。繼續發生的事的確是很痛心的。佛雷尼根默然不作聲，卡孫的態度很嚴厲，惠爾許是勝利了。卡孫厲聲問道：（爲什麽不早告訴我你們是坐過監牢的？）埃第的臉很慘白。（我告訴你，卡孫先生。假使告訴了我們主人，那末生意就找不到了！受過了多少次的經騐，因此我們决意不説。但我們已歸正向善，不是一樣的嗎？）但剖白又有何用。他們仍舊是失業了！而惠爾許緊緊的監視着，急切地想抓住把柄，他以爲一定能連贓把他們捉住的。</p>
<p>埃第勉强把思慮收拾起來，回到現在的情形。那洋燭的光耀飄摇地吹熄了，刀切破了厚厚的壽糕。餘興在屋頂上開始，埃第走出來。（女士和先生們。我們不惜重金禮聘蕭麗小姐在本屋頂初次表演。）在一陣熱烈的掌聲裏，他回身摔着一個美麗而秀雅的小小身裁，穿着蓬鬆舞衣的蕭麗出來。蕭麗於是向大衆鞠着躬，開始唱歌了。埃第和着。一回兒她的小脚跳起來了，他又跟着，但他那裏跟得上她，因爲蕭麗已經學到了幾種精奥的步法了。跳完時，那邊起一陣掌聲。埃第得意地説：（好個，保保，鞠個躬。——）客人們，孩子和大人們，散了。這的確是偉大的，美滿的歡會。琪恩與勞雷跟主人夫婦同立送客。此時，放送蕭麗跳舞音樂的無綫電仍開着。埃第於得意中幾乎渾忘了那脅逼着的風雲了。</p>
<p>無綫電清晰的，報告員聲音冲破了岑寂。（第五條街卡孫先生住宅昨夜被竊去價值五萬元的珠項鍊案，使警察四出活動，希望早日破案，警察當局認爲這竊案是宅内人所幹。）</p>
<p>凱的手帶着痙攣地握着蕭麗的手腕。（親愛的，來吧，現在是睡的時候了，）勞雷在旁邊低聲道：（事情似乎要弄糟了，）埃第點點頭，咬緊了嘴唇説道：（這回恐怕我們要吃苦了。）（未完）</p>

<h3>Elu Qin Unite as One</h3>
<p>Divided into attacking and defending armies vying for positions; felling willow branches to build pontoon bridges; more and more farmland is being trampled; American soldiers in Qinhuangdao travel along the Peiping-Liaoning Railway line. (Tianjin) Today, the Japanese army held exercises. Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao are united as one, with the Kwantung Army as the attacking force and the North China Garrison Army as the defending force. The defending army used Nandaisi as the assumed first line of defense. The Kwantung Army, after circling from the coast to the first line of defense at 7:00 AM, used armored vehicles to cover the daredevil team of hand grenades and machine guns to seize the trenches, and used artillery to cover the frontal infantry and cavalry assault. The defending army, assuming it could not hold, retreated from the left flank to the second line of defense at Shihekou. This part of the exercise ended at 11:00 AM. The second part of the exercise continued at 2:00 PM. The defending army, using the reservist volunteer corps to disrupt the enemy's rear, launched a large-scale counterattack, ending at 6:00 PM this evening, retaking the original positions. During today's large-scale Japanese army exercise, the troops used small sampans to go to Shihekou to cut down willow branches on both banks and build two pontoon bridges. Gunfire sounded from time to time east of Shihekou, agricultural work was suspended, and more and more farmland was trampled. (14th Dispatch) (Tianjin) Commander of the Japanese North China Garrison Army, Umezu, vehemently denied to foreign reporters that the Japanese army was conducting large-scale exercises in Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan, saying that the army was only practicing shooting targets and swimming on the beach. Foreigners all pointed out that this was self-deception. The Japanese army used the defense trenches of our army during the battles along the Great Wall on the left bank of the Shihe River as exercise positions. The trenches were more than twenty miles long, passing through hundreds of acres of farmland. This spring, the war zone committee had half filled them, but now they have been dug through again. The crops in the farmland have all been uprooted. The villagers endured the pain and dared not resist. The attitude of the British and American troops in Shanhaiguan remained as usual. They ignored the large-scale Japanese military exercises as in the past. The Japanese navy and army plan to hold joint exercises near Qinhuangdao for one day. The date has not been determined. Commander of the Third Fleet, Imamura, is currently waiting in Qinhuangdao to meet with Umezu. The Japanese warship Izumo is still anchored there and has not left. After the American soldiers stationed in Qinhuangdao exercised this morning, they marched along the Peiping-Liaoning Railway line to Haiyangzhen for camping, and are scheduled to return to Qin Island on the morning of the 15th. (14th Dispatch) (Peiping) According to sources in the transportation sector, there are six Japanese warships and ten British warships anchored off the coast of Qin Island. The Japanese warships regularly travel between Dalian, Yantai, and Qin Island. The British warships came from Liugong Island to escape the summer heat and do not contain any other intentions. (14th Dispatch) (Peiping) All the Japanese troops stationed in Gubeikou conducted live-fire field exercises on the large and small mountaintops near the pass. On the 10th, they practiced light and heavy machine guns in Xiguan, and on the 11th, they practiced mountain guns, heavy artillery, and field artillery outside Beiguan. (14th Dispatch) Japanese and puppet troops in Malanyu</p>
<h3>No Preparation to Withdraw</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Several hundred Japanese troops and one battalion of puppet troops are stationed in Malanyu. They conduct live-fire exercises in the Eastern Tombs area every day. The puppet troops are completely stationed around the Eastern Tombs. There were originally 35 aircraft in the airfield. Five aircraft flew to Rehe last month, and suddenly ten more arrived the day before yesterday. They routinely practice covering the army's attack every morning. In the afternoon, the advance team flies to Qian'an and Zunhua counties to transmit messages or investigate the situation. Yesterday, another hundred Japanese troops and dozens of puppet troops arrived from outside the pass, carrying heavy artillery and military supplies, and stationed in various places. In the afternoon, they joined the original Japanese troops and practiced charge and city attack in two teams. For a time, traffic was cut off, and the sounds of gunfire and artillery roared. Because the housing was not enough for residence, the Japanese side has summoned workers to build barracks in this town. It is said that the barracks outside the pass have been completed for many days, and Japanese troops have been transferred from Rehe to garrison.

<h3>Yellow River Breach at Changyuan</h3>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Government Ordered the River Works Department to Quickly Gather Labor to Provide Emergency Protection The Head of the Water is Eighty Li Away from the Shandong Border (Tianjin) The Hebei Yellow River Post-Disaster Engineering Office wired the province that the Yellow River breach at Changyuan, from Shitou Village to Dacheji section, has broken a total of more than 30 zhang. The water is still rising sharply. Dongjiazhai and the No. 17 Koumen have successively subsided and been submerged. The Engineering Office is gathering laborers to desperately plug the breach. The Changyuan breach is the breach of the last year, which was repaired and plugged this spring. Because the geology is pure sand and because the Mengzi Xiaonian cannot discharge smoothly, the willow dam has been repaired, but it has not worked. In addition to wiring to the central ministries, the provincial government ordered the River Works Department to quickly gather labor to provide emergency protection. (14th Dispatch) (Jinan) The head of the Jiugu Road Yellow River breach in Changyuan is already in Liangmen Town, Puyang County. The River Affairs Bureau received a telegram from Zhang Guozhong, the magistrate of Puyang County, on the 14th, saying that it is only more than 80 li away from the Shandong border. He is supervising the laborers to build embankments to prevent water. Zhang Lianjia, director of the River Affairs Bureau, arrived at Taochengbu on the night of the 13th and went to the upstream to inspect again on the 14th. The water in the Shandong Yellow River is still rising. The water level of Lisheng Tun has reached 58.44 meters, and the water level of Luokou is 30.05 meters. According to people from the River Affairs Bureau, if the water level of Lisheng Tun does not exceed 59 chi and the water level of Luokou does not exceed 31 chi, there will be no danger. In recent days, the water in Shanzhou upstream has fallen sharply. It is expected that the river water in Shandong will not rise again. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch) (Kaifeng) The Yellow River has now entered the autumn floods, and the water is rising sharply, not much different from last year's flood level. Whether there will be any danger in the future depends on whether the prevention is thorough and how the materials are prepared for the dangerous sections. According to the person in charge of the Henan Provincial River Affairs Bureau, there are no problems with the river ports in Henan Province, but the Lanfeng embankment is very dangerous if the Su and Anhui provinces cannot agree on the funds to reinforce it. As for the water level, the early and noon reports of Heigang Kou on the 13th were 7 gongcun lower than on the 12th, and Liuyuan Kou was also 3.2 gongcun lower. However, the water level in Shanzhou is rising daily. According to today's report, it is 9.9 gongcun higher than yesterday, which is equivalent to 1.25 chi according to the market scale.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Breakdown of Middle East Road Purchase Meeting</h3>
<p>The Middle East Road purchase meeting, which began in Tokyo in late June of last year, has been intermittent. The Japanese side has been unwilling to sincerely contribute funds for the purchase, while the Soviet Union has been reluctant to simply abandon it. Thus, it has been prolonged without any hope of resolution. Since Japan occupied the entire Northeast of our country, direct conflicts have repeatedly occurred with the Soviet Union on the border between Jilin and Heilongjiang. The outbreak of such conflicts could easily escalate into a Far Eastern war, serving as a trigger for a second world war. Therefore, both Japan and the Soviet Union are maintaining strict vigilance, with Japan particularly harboring intentions to provoke. Consequently, Japan has stationed heavy troops along the Middle East Road, constructed fortresses in key areas of the Greater Khingan Range, and built military projects in the Muling River area. Furthermore, there is a plan to build three lines in northern Manchuria, aiming to dismantle the Middle East Road and control its fate. The so-called three lines are: (1) a railway within Jilin Province along the Mudan River to Jiamusi, which is already under construction; (2) the Dunhua to Hailin line, which will also be actively pursued; and (3) the Tao'ang Railway in Heilongjiang Province, which will be fully utilized and extended along the Qiqihar-Keshan line to Heihe. If Japan's plan is realized, the Middle East Road will be divided into five sections from three, significantly reducing its economic and military value. According to Japanese propaganda, the aforementioned routes are entirely contracted by the South Manchuria Railway Company, driven by economic needs to absorb all agricultural products from the Northeast for export from Dalian. However, examining the inside story, the road construction is undoubtedly manipulated by the military and commanded by the Kwantung Army Commander. Its economic value is actually secondary. If we further consider the urgency with which the Japanese recently completed the Duntumen Railway, we can see that the main focus is not on economics but on military affairs.</p>
<p>However, after the Japanese army occupied Jilin and Heilongjiang, they forcibly used the Middle East Road under the pretext of suppressing the Volunteer Army, transporting soldiers and military supplies. This prevented the road from operating as usual. The Soviet Union, aware of the severity of the situation and seeking to ease tensions, proposed selling the road in the hope of avoiding a deepening war crisis. In reality, the Soviet Union was also well aware that Japan intended to seize it by force and had no intention of concluding a deal. The Japanese believed that the road was already in their possession and that they could easily obtain it without any compensation in the event of war. Why then should they pay the price in advance? Therefore, the so-called Middle East Road purchase meeting was fundamentally a farce. Moreover, Japan repeatedly used the relationship with the puppet Manchukuo to force the Soviet Union to de facto recognize the puppet organization, further complicating the purchase meeting.</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota even declared that he would no longer be responsible for mediation. Future negotiations regarding the Middle East Road should be conducted directly between the Soviet Union and (Manchukuo). Leaving aside the fact that the Soviet Union would hardly agree to this proposal, the so-called (Manchukuo) is known to the world as a Japanese puppet. The key negotiator, Hachiro Arita, nominally the Deputy Foreign Minister of the puppet state, is in fact still under the command of the General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs in Tokyo. It is clear that Hirota's rejection of mediation has a threatening nature, urging the Soviet Union to make practical concessions. However, the Soviet Union, with its formidable strength, would not easily show weakness without special conditions in return.</p>
<p>Now, the Middle East Road purchase meeting has come to a complete standstill due to Hirota's rejection of mediation. The military deployments of both sides along the Jilin-Heilongjiang border are becoming increasingly tense, as if the outbreak of war is imminent. However, we have long known that the breakdown of the meeting was an inevitable fact, so we do not want to overreact or say that the outcome of this matter will lead to a war between Japan and Russia. Furthermore, we dare to assert that before a major change occurs in the international situation leading to the formation of two distinct camps of global conflict, Japan and Russia will not be drawn into the vortex of war. From Japan's internal perspective, it also faces specific difficulties. The territory within the Northeast has not been stabilized, and the Huaiyuan-Solun Railway, the Erzhan-Heihe Railway, and the Yebaishou-Chengde Railway have not yet been completed. The economic crisis is deepening, all of which should make them extra cautious. Therefore, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union will worsen due to the breakdown of the Middle East Road purchase meeting, but to say that war is imminent is premature. Russia Joins the League of Nations</p>
<h3>Obstacles Completely Removed</h3>
<p>Permanent Council Seat Easily Obtained</p>
<p>Further Cooperation between the United States and the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Geneva) It was learned today that diplomatic talks between European countries have cleared major obstacles to the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union will be elected as a member of the League of Nations when the League of Nations General Assembly convenes in September. Issues that have delayed the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations, such as hiring Russians as League of Nations officials and the annual fees that the Soviet Union should pay to the League of Nations, have now been resolved. It is also heard that the Soviet Union will be a permanent member of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Poland may also take the opportunity to request a permanent seat on the Administrative Council, but it is heard that major countries will oppose this move. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) People here are quite surprised to learn that the United States government will appoint Wilson, the current US Minister to Switzerland, as a special envoy to the League of Nations. There are two reasons for this: (1) Wilson is familiar with the situation of the League of Nations Disarmament Conference and the Opium Conference, and has a harmonious relationship with people here for many years; (2) The second reason is that the United States' sending a special envoy to the League of Nations is not only a novel fact internationally, but also enough to show a change in US policy. The United States is the first non-member country to appoint a special envoy. Previously, only member countries sent representatives to Geneva to form a diplomatic corps. As for non-member countries appointing special envoys, it is equivalent to establishing an intermediate system between joining the League of Nations and sending observers. We still remember that in recent years, the United States has paid great attention to the affairs of Geneva, especially after President Roosevelt was elected. The United States pays attention to everything related to international issues. In recent months, the internal structure of the US Consulate General in Geneva has undergone considerable reforms, and its organization is adapted to the degree of US attention to international issues. Today's appointment of Wilson as a special envoy is the final stage of this effort, and is probably related to the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations in September. Also, at the recent League of Nations Labor Conference held in Geneva, the US Congress passed a bill allowing Roosevelt to declare joining the International Labor Organization. Subsequently, the International Labor Conference also unanimously invited the United States to join. The US President has not yet made a final decision, but this is only a matter of time. (According to the report, the International Labor Conference formally invited the United States to join this year in June, but attached a reservation that although the United States joins, it has no obligations under international treaties. It is heard that the United States will join at the conference next year. US representatives previously attended the International Labor Conference as observers, but after June 22 this year, they attended as official representatives.) (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Political circles here attach great importance to the State Department's appointment of Wilson, the Minister to Switzerland, as a special envoy to the League of Nations. This decision has not yet been formally announced, so it is not yet known whether Wilson will accept the title of special envoy, or whether he will continue to perform his new duties under the name of Consul General Gilbert, which he has always used. Even if Wilson does not use the title of special envoy, it is enough to show that the State Department's decision is very meaningful, because Wilson has an important position and a very good international reputation. According to informed sources, Wilson will retain his position as Minister to Switzerland and will also report to the President on the overall situation in Europe on a regular basis.

The report describes the relationship between the Saar regional police and the (German Front) within the region and the German National Secret Police in the nearby city of Trier, and explains that some people continue to incite residents to oppose certain officials of the Administrative Commission. The conclusion states that the Administrative Commission believes that it is impossible to recruit police locally. If the nearby garrison (referring to French troops) is asked to assist in maintaining order, there will be various inconveniences. Therefore, the only method is for the League of Nations to recruit police from neutral countries. Countries such as member states that use German can be considered. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>US Expansion of Air Force Program</h3>
<p>Building 2,000 Aircraft Within Five Years</p>
<p>Actively Reorganizing the Naval Aviation School</p>
<p>(Washington) Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Committee, recently announced that a five-year plan to build 2,100 seaplanes is now ready to begin. However, although the plan has been approved by Congress, no special funds have been allocated for this purpose. In addition, Vincent plans to develop the Philadelphia aircraft factory and improve the Naval Aviation School in Pensacola, Florida. (Havas Telegram, 13th) Japan's Determination</p>
<h3>To Break the Naval Ratio</h3>
<p>Preemptive Strike Against Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Will Demand the Abolition of the Treaty</p>
<p>(Washington) According to news obtained today from diplomatic circles here, Japan will soon declare the cancellation of the Washington Naval Treaty. A reporter from the Associated Press asked the Japanese Embassy about this news. The reply was that there was no formal decision yet, but it was said that (Japan has a very strong intention to do this). It has long been rumored here that Japan intends to take such drastic action. However, according to general opinion, it is unlikely that Japan will declare the abolition of the 1922 Washington Treaty before the London Naval Preparatory Conference is held in mid-October. It is likely that the firm attitude of Britain and the United States towards Japan's demand to abolish the existing naval ratio has forced Japan to take preemptive action. According to the Washington Treaty, the ratio of capital ships among Britain, the United States, and Japan is 5:5:3. The 1931 London Treaty only extended the validity of the Washington Treaty to January 1, 1936, and postponed the construction of certain types of warships. Therefore, if the Washington Treaty is abolished, the 5:5:3 naval ratio will also be naturally canceled. This is the goal that Japan wants to achieve regardless of the opposition of Britain and the United States. (National News Agency Telegram, 13th)</p>

<h3>Death Ray is Terrible</h3>
<p>All Matter is Instantly Destroyed</p>
<p>A Million Lives Can Be Lost in an Instant</p>
<p>Silent, Invisible, the Only Weapon to End War</p>
<p>- A Statement by the American Inventor -</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New York, July 18. Dr. Tesla, an American, is 78 years old and has recently invented a terrible (death ray). Dr. Tesla claims that he has invented no fewer than 700 things, and the (death ray) is the most important. It is said that after this thing is invented, it will make war impossible. The characteristic of the (death ray) is that it does not leave any traces on the battlefield, only to see all things destroyed and a desolate scene. It can kill a million lives in an instant. Its light surrounds an area, like the Great Wall of China, but it cannot be seen by the naked eye, and its solidity is a million times greater than the Great Wall. The path of this light carries 50 million watts of power, and whatever it hits will be destroyed. This thing is formed by the combination of four inventions. He intends to present the details to legitimate scientific organizations in the near future. The first invention is a method and equipment for generating light and expressing other kinetic energy in free air, eliminating the high vacuum necessary for producing this light at present. The second invention is a method for generating very large amounts of electricity. The third invention is a new method for expanding the second invention. The fourth invention is a method for obtaining the greatest electrical resistance. The watts used to propel the (death ray) contain 50 million watts of power. Artificial methods have never reached this height. All matter that it hits will be pulverized. This thing can only be used by defenders, not by attackers, because this light can only be generated by huge stationary machines and cannot be moved around at will for attacking purposes. However, warships can carry smaller machines to generate this light, which is powerful enough to destroy aircraft attacking from the air. This can make warships superior to aircraft and allow the country with the most sophisticated warships to dominate the sea. The doctor believes that submarines will become obsolete in the future, because the methods of detection are so perfect that submarines will have no way to hide underwater. Moreover, the effectiveness of the (death ray) underwater, although not as great as in the air, is sufficient to destroy submarines. The doctor also said that the operation of the (death ray) cannot be heard by the ear or seen by the eye. Anything that can be seen by a telescope and is on the horizon can be destroyed. It can also shoot down 10,000 enemy aircraft 250 miles away in an instant on the border of the defending country.</p>

<p>(London) The Morning Post reported that the London City Land Committee is now advocating the construction of a large airfield in the center of London, planning to build a cement platform spanning the Thames River, along its banks, or above the riverside freight stations. The height of this platform should be at least 200 feet, so that aircraft will not be in danger of colliding with St. Paul's Cathedral or other tall objects. The cost of this type of airfield is estimated to be around 5 million pounds. (Reuters Telegram, 13th) British Industrial Delegation</p>
<h3>Will Visit Puppet Manchukuo for Inspection</h3>
<p>Aimed at Developing Exports to Manchukuo</p>
<p>Claiming to Have No Political Nature</p>
<p>Scheduled to Depart from London on the 24th of This Month</p>
<p>(London) The authorities of the British Industrial Association told the Associated Press today that the industrial inspection delegation to (Manchukuo) currently underway is entirely industrial in nature and has no major political implications. Reports from Peiping, Shanghai, and Moscow all state that China and Russia feel deeply uneasy about it, because the delegation may be a prelude to British recognition of (Manchukuo). According to sources here, the delegation will focus on the issue of expanding exports of machinery and materials to Manchukuo, especially in the areas of railways, road construction, port construction, agriculture, mining, and factories. According to reliable sources, the delegation members do not intend to discuss British-Japanese commercial competition and long-term loans. However, they will discuss British-Japanese joint development of industries in Manchukuo and short-term or semi-long-term loans to meet the needs of transporting goods to Manchukuo. The delegation is scheduled to depart on August 24, taking the route of Yokohama, Tokyo, Dalian, Seoul, and then to Changchun. It is scheduled to stay in Manchukuo for three weeks and then return to the country via Japan. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>

<h3>Leaving France to Return Home</h3>
<p>Warm Farewell from French Dignitaries</p>
<p>The Lyon Soviet Air Force team, led by civil aviation director Enshilito, set off from here today to fly back to their country. The mayor, cabinet member Horio, and many dignitaries went to see them off. The air force team is heading to Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, and is expected to arrive by midday. Before leaving, Enshilito issued a statement expressing his gratitude to Aviation Minister General Tran, Horio, Acting Foreign Minister Pittley, and the municipalities of Paris and Lyon for their hospitality. He also said that France and Russia share a desire to safeguard peace and security in Europe, and he firmly believes that the Soviet Air Force team's visit will further strengthen friendship between the two countries. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Lyon The Lyon city government held a grand banquet at noon today to entertain the Soviet aviators. Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in France, Roshanbei, and the leader of the Soviet Air Force team, Enshilito, sat on either side of Mayor and cabinet member Horio. Many officials from the Rhône province and members of parliament were invited to attend. Horio delivered a speech on the spot, first thanking the Soviet Air Force team for their visit, which he said was deeply appreciated. He then praised the strength of the Soviet Air Force, saying that the Soviet military strength serves peace and is therefore worthy of praise. He believes that the Soviet aviators' visit to France in return for an invitation is beneficial to peace and is therefore very interested in it. As for his initiation of the restoration of diplomatic relations between France and Russia in 1924 and his signing of a non-aggression treaty with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov in 1932, all of this was for the sake of peace. Litvinov is a friend whom he admires. Horio then wished that the union between France and Russia would become closer and closer, saying that it would be very beneficial to peace, progress, and culture. The Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Roshanbei responded, stating that Horio is a meritorious figure in bringing France and Russia closer together. He also said that (today's friendship between France and Russia is a fact and cannot be denied. Both governments are produced by strong popular movements, so they share the same concern for peace. France loves peace, which I know well. As for the Soviet Union, it also faithfully adheres to the concept of seeking peace in security. Countries like these are strong pillars of peace). Roshanbei concluded by expressing his gratitude to the city government of Lyon for its hospitality, saying that the Russian people and the people of Lyon share a common strength, which is loyalty to friendship. In the afternoon, the Soviet aviators, led by Horio and military and political dignitaries, visited the nearby military aviation airfield of Bailong to inspect the aircraft of the 5th Air Force Squadron. Then, they went to the civil aviation airfield to visit. In the evening, General Benoît invited the Soviet aviators to a casual dinner at a large restaurant. The aviators are scheduled to leave for their country tomorrow. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Philippine Islands Rejecting Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Intend to Further Increase Import Taxes by 30%</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received by the government, the Philippines is actively preparing for Philippine independence. Its trade policy adopts a policy of protecting American goods and resisting Japanese goods. The Philippines previously increased tariffs by 50%, and now, with the aim of resisting Japanese goods, it plans to increase tariffs by 30%. The Philippine Congressmen have already launched a campaign to request the understanding of the United States Department of Commerce and the Department of the Treasury.

<h3>US Silver Policy</h3>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today that the Department of the Treasury will soon receive 60 million ounces of silver, which is currently in the equalization fund, to continue expanding the currency. The price of silver received will remain at 45 cents per ounce. After the equalization fund is used, it is hoped that silver can be secretly purchased on the world market at a low price. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today changed his silver policy again. Morgenthau told reporters at 3 pm today that the remaining silver reserves for issuing 80 million yuan in silver certificates will be recorded according to their original value. On Saturday and Sunday, Morgenthau said that silver not related to the recent issuance of silver certificates would be entered into the record at the statutory price of silver, which is 1.29 yuan per ounce. However, Morgenthau maintained part of Saturday's statement in today's conversation, that is, the silver certificates currently being issued will be based on 1.29 yuan per ounce, and 62 million ounces of silver will be used as reserves. If the silver certificates to be issued recently are calculated at 1.29 yuan per ounce of silver, they will only be enough to purchase silver. However, the Department of the Treasury can benefit greatly from this, because the average price paid by the government for silver is estimated to be 75 cents per ounce. Now, once 80 million silver certificates are issued, the continued issuance of silver certificates will be determined based on the amount of silver purchased. However, the Department of the Treasury does not want to express its opinion on the purchase of silver in foreign markets. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>

<h3>Stalled Negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>The Fake Representative Leaves Japan Empty-Handed and Returns to Manchuria  The Japanese Military Plans to Seize the Railway by Force (Tokyo) The fake Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ohashi Chuji, who was negotiating the Chinese Eastern Railway issue in Tokyo, left Tokyo today at 7:30 PM with the two fake secretaries, Mori and Sugihara, to return to Manchuria. It is said that Ohashi plans to hold an emergency meeting with the fake organization and the Kwantung Army after arriving in Changchun to decide on a final stance. (14th Hua Lian Telegram) The fake Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ohashi, has already returned to Changchun this morning. It is also rumored that Katz-Levski, one of the Russian negotiators, will also return to Moscow. The Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations have effectively broken down. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not believe that there is no hope of saving the situation, considering it a difficult hurdle rather than a breakdown. The fake ambassador, Ding Shiyuan, and the Russian ambassador, Yurenev, are still in Tokyo. Furthermore, although the Russian ambassador rejected Foreign Minister Hirota's mediation proposal and presented a new one, he did not explicitly state that it was the final proposal from the Russian side. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expects that the Russian side still has a final proposal, and the Russian ambassador will visit Foreign Minister Hirota again within the next few days to make a new statement. (14th Hua Lian Telegram) (Tokyo) (Manchukuo) Representative Ohashi, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, has decided to withdraw and return home because the negotiations for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway have stalled. He departed from Tokyo at 7:30 PM on the 14th with Mori, the section chief of the Ministry of Transportation, Yu, the section chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other staff members. He is scheduled to take the Baikalvan from Kobe at noon on the 15th, passing through Dalian to return to Changchun. Representative Ohashi and his team have been stationed in Japan for this negotiation for one year and two months. (14th Japanese United Telegram) Remarks by Representative Ohashi (Tokyo) The Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations ultimately resulted in a breakdown. (Manchukuo) Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ohashi told reporters at the (Manchukuo) Embassy last night, "The Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations have reached the final stage. It is useless to stay here any longer, so I have decided to return to Manchuria tomorrow. Direct negotiations are particularly difficult because the Soviet Union has no sincerity. However, the negotiations are not broken off. If the Soviet Union reconsiders, I can come again, but from the current situation, I am afraid there is no hope. If it breaks down, the responsibility lies entirely with the Soviet Union." (14th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>The Hardline Attitude of the Japanese Military (Tokyo) The Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations have broken down. The Army authorities have the following position: This time, Foreign Minister Hirota proposed a compromise plan to advise a satisfactory resolution, but the Soviet Union's attitude was insincere, and nothing was achieved. Since the Soviet Union has expressed such an attitude, there is no need to continue negotiations. The only option is to operate the Chinese Eastern Railway as a private railway, assert (Manchukuo)'s rights, and if the Soviet Union still refuses to transport Japanese soldiers on the eastern line or uses bandits to sabotage the railway, then thorough suppression should be carried out. (14th Dentsu Telegram) Indication from the Fake Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Changchun) The fake Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed the following regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations: The Manchurian side regards Foreign Minister Hirota as the final party, waiting for the Soviet Union to approach. If the Soviet Union consistently refuses, it will only lead to its own disadvantage. If the negotiations break down, there is an intention to withdraw the representatives, but no decision has been made at present. (14th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Deteriorating Situation Between Russia and the Fakes</h3>
<p>Russian Railway Staff Movement Restricted  Mongolian Soldiers of Sanhezhen Ambushed (Tianjin) The fake police force accused the Soviet Union railway staff of supplying arms to the volunteer forces in Suifenhe, Dongning, and Mishan, and of radicalizing the people. They have designated the area east of Hailin Station, including Maqiaohe, Muling Station, and Mudanjiang, as an emergency zone. Russian railway staff are not allowed to cross without permission from the police force. The Russian Consul General in Harbin, Shlauchitsky, lodged a serious protest with the fake Harbin negotiator, claiming that it interfered with the work of the railway staff. On the 9th of this month, five Soviet soldiers from Sanhezhen on the Harbin-Manzhouli line of the Chinese Eastern Railway secretly entered for reconnaissance. The Mongolian soldiers stationed there heard the news and pursued them, but were lured to the border by the Russian soldiers. A large detachment of Red Guards suddenly appeared and launched a head-on attack. Seven Mongolian soldiers were killed, and a Japanese instructor was captured. The situation in Harbin-Manzhouli is quite dangerous. White Russians living in Sanhezhen have abandoned their homes and fled to Hailar. (14th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Frequent Border Disputes</h3>
<p>The Fakes File Protests, Russia Ignores Them (Harbin) The Japanese and fake sides have repeatedly claimed that Russian soldiers have crossed the border. Despite repeated protests, the Russian side claims that there are no facts of border crossings and that the locations pointed out by the fake side as border crossing points are actually within Russian territory. The fake side has no recourse. It is said that the national border lines on the map and in reality are inconsistent, which causes disputes between Russia and the fakes. There will be a major dispute in the future. (14th Hua Lian Telegram) (Harbin) According to the Japanese side, since July, Russian Red Guards have crossed the Manzhouli border twice. Although protests have been made, they have been ineffective. On the 11th, five Russian soldiers crossed the western border of Manzhouli. They escaped after being discovered by the fake border guards. Today, the fake Ministry of Foreign Affairs office submitted a letter of protest to the Russian Consulate General, requesting it to be conveyed to Moscow.

<h3>Focuses on the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Japan-Russia Relations Become Increasingly Tense  Recognizing the Possibility of War (London) The entire Far East problem has recently attracted increasing attention from British public opinion. The Times recently published an editorial commenting on the disturbances in Tibet and Xinjiang, with a tone of indignation towards Soviet Russia, stating that (the Soviet government has ordered its newspapers to publish unfounded reports, falsely accusing Britain of having some conspiracy in Xinjiang). Although what British newspapers are most anxious about is not the misunderstanding between Britain and Russia, but the tension between Japan and Russia. Regarding this point, a telegram sent yesterday by the Daily Express correspondent stationed in Harbin, although not enough to represent the current situation, is sufficient to show the importance of the telegram when explaining the recent relationship between the two countries. The telegram briefly stated that the authorities today discovered a huge conspiracy, allegedly instigated by Soviet Russia. As a result, thirty Russian nationals were immediately arrested, accused of participating in the conspiracy. It was also said that a Russian national hired by the Japanese military mission in Suifenhe was suddenly assassinated, thus revealing the aforementioned conspiracy. It is said that the rebels conspired to kill the leaders of the fake government, the head of the Japanese military mission, the head of the Japanese military police, and the administrative staff of the Chinese Eastern Railway. According to Japanese military officers, they have obtained documents proving that Soviet cadres in Bo Li have instructed the Chinese volunteer army near Yimianpo to destroy the Chinese Eastern Railway tracks, causing all passing trains to derail. According to observations by the general public, disputes between Japan and Russia have continued for three years, often posing a risk of war. The discovery of the aforementioned conspiracy and the detention of thirty Russians are the most serious in nature. However, the opinions of some Labor and Liberal parties seem to believe that the events that will occur in Geneva in the coming months may add a new factor to the situation. The Daily Herald recently acknowledged once again the rumors circulating outside that the Soviet Union would request to join the next League of Nations session, and stated that this move by the Soviet Union would now be warmly welcomed by the British and French governments. Due to the importance of the discussions at the next League of Nations session, Britain plans to send a strong delegation, composed of Foreign Secretary Simon, Lord Privy Seal Eden, and Under-Secretary of State for Scotland Kelton. As for French foreign policy, it is now focusing its efforts on completing the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. Since France proposed this proposal, only Poland and Germany have not yet responded. France is determined to pressure the two countries to respond, so that the situation can be clarified when the main body of the Disarmament Conference meets on September 12. Poland has always held a hostile attitude towards the Eastern European Pact, but is now hesitant. Germany wants to find a way to avoid the isolated position of dealing with the Eastern European Pact alone. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Expanding the Austrian Army to Deal with Incidents</h3>
<p>Will Be Approved at the League of Nations Meeting Next Month  Austrian Prime Minister Scheduled to Visit Mussolini (Vienna) Today, according to reliable sources, various countries are about to conduct diplomatic negotiations to maintain Austria's independence and fear that the National Socialist Party will plot another uprising, with the aim of increasing the number of Austrian troops. Although the Austrian army has reached the limit stipulated in the treaty, the Austrian government is still worried that its military strength is insufficient to deal with incidents. It is known for certain that the Austrian government deeply fears that if the National Socialist Party launches another uprising, its organization will be more thorough and rigorous. As a precaution, it has formally submitted a note to the governments of Britain, France, and Italy, requesting that the previous method be restored, allowing it to recruit a special auxiliary force of 8,000 men in addition to the existing 22,000 regular army. The authorities of Britain, France, and Italy have expressed deep sympathy for this and have consulted with each other, and will soon be able to give a satisfactory reply. It will be approved and implemented at the League of Nations General Assembly next month. Austrian Deputy Prime Minister Starhemberg may have raised this matter when he met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Woschia recently. (14th National Telegram) (London) Today it was heard that Austrian Prime Minister Dr. Schuschnigg plans to go to Rome on August 21 to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. All circles in Britain are paying close attention to this meeting. It is now known that the meeting between Austrian Deputy Prime Minister Prince Starhemberg and the Italian Prime Minister in Wostia at the end of last week was of an informal nature, and was only a preparation for the important talks on August 21. (14th Reuters Telegram) Vienna Most of the Austrian National Socialists fled to Yugoslavia after the failed rebellion. Recently, the semi-official 聨邦郵報 claimed to have reliable information that a large number of National Socialists who had fled to Yugoslavia were now being cared for by the German consulate, and were returning to Germany via Hungary. According to official news from Rome received by the semi-official 聨邦郵報, the German National Socialist propagandist Habicht (formerly the Austrian National Socialist inspector, who was expelled by the Austrian government) and the Austrian National Socialist leader Feilonfeld were rumored to have been arrested, but in fact they are still at large. As of now, the National Socialist Austrian army has not been disbanded. According to those who are well-informed about the National Socialist incident, the Austrian National Socialist cadres established in the German monk city have not stopped working, but have only temporarily suspended their activities until September 15. As for Habicht, he is still working closely with Propaganda Minister Goebbels. It is also heard that the National Socialists will temporarily abandon violent actions against Austria, but recently Hitler personally declared to the Austrian National Socialist leaders that he would never abandon the principle of the Austrian government joining the organization led by the National Socialists, and that he would oppose any Austrian restoration attempts and would not allow them to succeed.

At 4:00 PM, the judge adjourned the court for deliberation and returned to court after three hours. At 7:16 PM, the bell rang to reopen the court, and the whole court was silent. The judge then took his seat and announced that four police officers, (1) Li Bai, (2) Wei Zeng, (3) Jia Xuker, and (4) Walrabai, had participated in the July 25th rebellion and were all guilty of treason and sentenced to hanging. The defendants Xue Lotuo and Tao Bake were sentenced to life imprisonment. The other two defendants were sentenced to 20 years of solitary confinement, and the ninth defendant was sentenced to 15 years. Those sentenced to death were to be executed in the evening, but President Miklas could still exercise the power of pardon. A large army was stationed in the court today to prevent incidents. A large number of police were also stationed in the nearby and central areas of the city. The four police officers sentenced to death were hanged at 10:30 PM tonight.

<h3>Launch Propaganda Across the Country</h3>
<p>Hitler Simultaneously Holds the Position of President  Prepared to Be Approved by the People (Berlin) Tonight, the nine giants of New Germany simultaneously broadcast speeches in nine different locations to promote the major event of the people's vote on Sunday for Hitler to take office as president. Among the nine, Propaganda Minister Goebbels was the main figure. He spoke to 50,000 people at the Neue Körner Sportarena in the center of Berlin. The remaining eight included General Goering speaking in Munich, Interior Minister Dr. Frick speaking in Cologne, National Socialist Deputy Leader Hess speaking in Breslau, new Chief of Staff of the Sturmabteilung Lütz speaking in Königsberg, Education Minister Rostede speaking in Hanover, as well as former worker Sturmabteilung leader Lei, Justice Minister Kerr, and Farmers Minister Dahl, all of whom spoke in major cities about the significance of this people's vote. In addition, local social leaders and giants from the art, science, and economics circles will join the propaganda work this week, which will end on Friday night, at which time Hitler will personally give a concluding speech. The main points of Goebbels's speech were why Hitler's assumption of the presidency must be approved by the people of the whole country. He said that now millions of people are questioning the need for the people's approval, because the people of the whole country believe that there is no one but Hitler who can take on the heavy responsibility left by former President Hindenburg. He also said that the purpose of holding this people's vote is not to make people understand that Hitler is a necessary figure today, but to make foreign countries understand that the German people unanimously support Hitler. All people have the sacred duty to vote, so if the number of voters this time is less than the number of votes cast on November 12 last year, foreign countries will say that Hitler's era has reached the end of the day. According to the rules of arithmetic, all countries in the world must wait until 40 million years later to see the demise of the German National Socialist government. Goebbels explained the rumors circulating outside about the restoration of Germany, saying that the German people have the freedom to choose their leaders, but in the future, people will use the ability to serve the country as the standard for selection, and not rely on blood.

Agriculture Secretary Wallace and officials from the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration gathered at the White House today at the invitation of President Roosevelt to listen to the president's disaster relief opinions. The president, who had witnessed the severity of the disaster on his way back to the capital from Honolulu, advocated that the government's disaster relief efforts should be increased. It is said that the president will issue a more definitive policy in the near future, but because the needs of the disaster area are urgent, he has ordered the agencies to step up their work immediately. The most important thing is to buy fodder to feed the starving livestock and to buy fresh fruits and meats for quick canning to provide food for farm families in the disaster area in the autumn and winter. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration announced a week ago that the $52.5 million allocated by the last Congress will be used up within the year, so the first bill to be considered when the next Congress convenes must be to allocate additional funds.

<h3>Xu Shilian Discusses Silver Prices</h3>

Currently, it's actually just a legal basis used to stabilize commodity prices at any time. Therefore, before the US actually implements the nationalization, it will not have any impact. The central government already has corresponding policies to deal with this issue. As for the ban on silver exports, it is not a fundamental solution and is also extremely difficult in practice. Therefore, future efforts should focus on bringing commodity prices and silver prices to a balanced level, hoping to reach the situation in February of the 20th year of the Republic of China, so that commodity prices can gradually stabilize."

<h3>Building Roads in Musuo County</h3>
<p>Suspecting Chinese Laborers of Being Reactionary, More Than 3,000 People Were Massacred Changchun Correspondence: This spring, in order to facilitate transportation for attacking righteous armies, the Japanese army built a military railway from the Musuo Coal Mine to Wangjiashaoguo Village in Mishan County. More than 3,200 workers were recruited, with daily wages set at two yuan in pseudo-national currency. The Japanese claimed that there were bandits everywhere in the mountains, and if wages were paid on time, they might be robbed. Wages would be paid in full once the work was completed. The general ignorant workers believed this to be a well-intentioned act of protection. When the work was completed, the Japanese army forced the workers to board vehicles to receive their wages at a certain station. The workers believed this to be true, but unexpectedly, all 3,000 workers were taken to a remote place in the mountains of Mishan. The area had been pre-wired with an electric fence. The workers were driven into the enclosure and then brutally shot with machine guns. Tragically, all 3,000 workers died unjustly. It is said that the Japanese army suspected that these workers had colluded with the righteous army, hence this tragic death. After the massacre, the corpses were burned, and the acrid smell of burning spread for several miles. The intention behind this was twofold: to save the wages and to prevent the workers from participating in resistance against the pseudo-state (Manchukuo) in the future. From this, the intentions of the Japanese can be seen. (Northeast News Agency) Jiang, Wang, et al.</p>

<h3>Jiang Dingwen Returns to Zhangzhou</h3>
<p>Talks About the Communist Disturbance in Shuikou and the Recovery Process Xiamen Correspondence: Jiang Dingwen, Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Army, flew from Zhang to the province on the afternoon of the 3rd due to the communist disturbance in Shuikou. On the 4th, he went to the front line to supervise the army and recovered Shuikou. After the communists retreated to Shayou, he returned to Zhangzhou from the province by Sikorsky No. 9 aircraft at 3:30 PM on the 8th, arriving at 4:30 PM. On the morning of the 9th, he met with reporters from various newspapers at his office and talked about the communist disturbance in Shuikou. He said, "Although there are remnants of Luo Binghui's communist troops among those disturbing Shuikou, most of them are local communists. They only have 2,000 guns. The security regiment stationed in Fangshuikou retreated in panic because they had not detected the enemy's situation and had no good training. Shuikou then fell into communist hands for a total of four days. When our reinforcements arrived, the communists fled to Youxi and Shaxian. Shuikou has been completely recovered. I have ordered the troops stationed in Shuikou, Yanping, Shaxian, and Yong'an to quickly encircle and suppress them, annihilate them in one fell swoop, and prevent them from fleeing westward. The reason why the communists were able to intrude and disturb the rear this time is that the blockade fortifications, such as blockhouses, between Ningyang, Yong'an, Datian, Shaxian, Yanping, and other counties near the communist area were not complete and tight enough, and the distance was too far, so a small number of troops and defense regiments could not respond to each other, and they were taken advantage of. I have ordered the garrison troops to work with the county government to build fortifications and deploy heavy troops to ensure that this does not happen again. As for why I (Jiang refers to himself) flew to the province and to Minqing and Shaxian to inspect the front line due to the tense military situation in northern Fujian, there is no trace of communists in the Minjiang River basin. In the military situation, the people of the provincial capital did not understand the communist strategy of attacking in the east and west and were frightened by the sound of gunfire from those who attempted to steal around the provincial capital. In fact, the provincial capital is heavily defended, and our army has deployed heavy troops, so it will never allow them to invade. Moreover, the place is near the sea. If the communists were to fall into the provincial capital and lightly enter a heavily defended place, it would give us the opportunity to annihilate them. They would have no way to retreat. Also, after the Shuikou incident occurred, I ordered the rear troops to advance and suppress them, but the communists fled to Youxi before our army reached Shuikou. The purpose of the communists' sudden intrusion into our hinterland was to move the main army that was encircling the main communist area in the front to return to suppress it, so as to break through the blockade of the communist area. However, we were not moved by this. The communist suppression troops in northern Fujian against Ninghua and western Fujian against Changting were not mobilized at all this time. The general offensive can be carried out in western Fujian within days, and the communist area in Fujian Province must be completely recovered within this month. Our army has repeatedly encircled and suppressed them, forcing them into their old nest. With this achievement, we can wipe them out in one fell swoop. Therefore, even if they suddenly disturb the rear, we cannot lightly move the troops recovering the communist area. Their plan has failed, and when we attack the communist nest and eradicate its roots, the communists who flee out can be annihilated one by one by our army on the spot," he said. According to military news, the purpose of the communist intrusion into Shuikou was to plunder salt, oil, and food. Since the strict implementation of the blockade in the counties of western Fujian, Zhangping and Hua'an have had very little salt, oil, and grain left. Under the strategy of governing poverty with poverty, the communists find it difficult to succeed. Moreover, due to the perfect construction of defensive fortifications such as blockhouses and communication trenches, if the communists attempt to intrude, they will inevitably suffer losses. The communists plundered a lot of salt and oil in Datian, because in the past, Xingquan Yong and other places did not implement a blockade, which led to communist covetousness.

<p>Full Harvest in Jiangbei, Poor Harvest in Jiangnan Average Can Yield 70% Zhenjiang Correspondence: Jiangsu Province has suffered from severe drought in Jiangnan this year. Most of the mountain fields have no rice to harvest. East of Changzhou, the lake fields in the Taihu Lake basin can still use manual water pumps to draw water to maintain the life of the rice, but the labor is expensive and the rice is cheap, making the farmers' cost not worth it. However, based on the annual yield, although Jiangnan is drought-stricken, the average autumn harvest is still 20-30%. Because Jiangnan has a lot of late rice, there is still hope if there is good rain in July and August of the lunar calendar. The Jiangbei Lixia River has a full harvest this year, and the autumn harvest is expected to be 100%. Drought-resistant grains and soybeans are also good in the Qingjiang area. However, west of Xuzhou, there is heavy rain, showing signs of flooding. Tongzhou cotton can also have a bumper harvest if there is no more continuous rain in Jiangbei. According to the above survey, the areas in Jiangsu that have been affected by drought certainly need to seek relief. But on the whole, if the weather does not change drastically and Jiangnan continues to have rain, the average yield can still be 70%. However, general grain merchants are taking advantage of the opportunity to monopolize and control the market. The rice price in Zhenjiang has increased by 4-5 yuan per stone within ten days, and soybean oil has dropped from 9 jin per yuan to 6 jin within three days. According to this situation, the rice price may decrease when Jiangnan harvests in autumn. It is also impossible to know. (14th) Songjiang</p>

<h3>Our Country's</h3>
<p>Silk Sales to India Will Become More Difficult The Mumbai Customs Department Recognizes Silk as Raw Silk and Levies a Special Tax The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Has Sent a Letter Arguing Reasonably Except for Mysore and Ximmi in India, where the weather is mild and silk can be produced, the weather is hot in other places and not suitable for sericulture. However, the amount of silk used in the country is not less than that of our country. However, they are all inferior raw silk, such as the local silk and silk used in our country. In recent years, the Indian government has been determined to rectify and has repeatedly sent commissioners to our country and Japan to practice sericulture and increase production. In addition, it has increased the import tax on raw silk to 25% of the value, which is still not enough, and added a special tax of 14 anna per 100 pounds (worth 9 jiao in Chinese currency), which has greatly impacted our country's silk sales to India. Recently, the Mumbai Customs Department of India has once again recognized the silk exported from our country as raw silk and levied a special tax. Export silk merchants have already felt difficult, and if unexpected taxes are added, they will be unbearable. Yesterday, Zhu Wei-gu, the manager of Wanli Company, met with Director Cai and Director Miao of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to request that they send a letter to prove that silk and raw silk are different, and state the reasons why they cannot be regarded as one, in order to avoid reducing this additional special tax, so that our country's silk can be sold smoothly in India. The bureau agreed to send a letter immediately to argue reasonably. It is said that India sells 3,000 to 4,000 dan of silk per month, and Shanghai exports only 500 dan. The price per dan is 300 yuan. The only Chinese companies operating silk are Jiaxing Weicheng and Shanghai Zhongfu. In addition, there is also a Japanese Shanghai Silk Company.</p>
<h3>National Accountants Association Presents a Document</h3>
<p>Please Stipulate in the Manager Section of the Civil Code If the Loss of Capital of a Business Reaches One-Third The Manager Should Report to the Authorizer Immediately The National Accountants Association presented a document to the Ministry of Industry, stating that Article 681 of the current Civil Code stipulates that if the partnership property is insufficient to pay off the partnership debts, each partner is jointly and severally liable for the insufficient amount. Article 554 of the Civil Code stipulates that the relationship between the manager and the third party is regarded as having the right to perform all necessary acts for management. Therefore, the managers of the current businesses often exercise their full powers on weekdays and believe that there is no need to report to the authorizing sole proprietor or the authorizing partners. Once the business fails, they still make the sole proprietor or partner responsible for compensation. The sole proprietor and partner will inevitably suffer unexpected losses. If the losses are too large, the sole proprietor or partner will not be able to bear it, and they will inevitably go bankrupt, which will harm the society. Article 147 of the Company Law stipulates that when the loss of capital of a company reaches one-third of the total amount, the directors shall immediately convene a shareholders' meeting to report it. The legislative intent is to enable the shareholders to know the actual situation of the company's losses and decide on future actions. The intention is good and beautiful. The manager is authorized by the sole proprietor or partner to manage the affairs of the business, and the nature of the director elected by the shareholders to perform the company's business is the same. In order to protect the society and investors, it seems that a special article can be stipulated in the manager section of the Civil Code that the manager should report to the authorizer immediately when the capital loss of the business he manages reaches one-third of the total amount, otherwise, the manager will be deemed to be negligent and should be liable for compensation. The sole proprietor or partner can know the actual situation of the loss in advance and make plans for the future, and it will not harm the society. The association has seen this, so it submits a document to the ministry, requesting the Legislative Yuan to examine and implement it, which is convenient for the public.</p>
<p>The study of the savings law has been completed.</p>
<h3>Bank Association Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The subcommittee has already drafted a document to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance, inviting non-member banks to participate in the discussion. The Shanghai Banking Association, in response to an instruction from the Ministry of Finance to supervise the implementation of Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law, appointed representatives from the Sze Ming Bank, Chee Yih Bank, Kuo Hua Bank, New China Bank, and the Kin Cheng Bank, including Hu Xi'an, Luo Qinghua, Qu Jigan, Sun Ruihuang, and Chen Liting, to form a subcommittee for research. The subcommittee met yesterday and unanimously agreed that Articles 5, 8, and 15 of the Savings Bank Law were indeed difficult to implement. To effectively protect the interests of savings depositors, the association has submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance, which will be forwarded to the Executive Yuan, requesting the Legislative Yuan to approve amendments to the law. As for Article 9 of the same law, there was no dispute among the banking community. However, the previous instruction from the Ministry of Finance omitted the phrase "(other assets with definite security)," and there were no clear instructions regarding the custody method. Therefore, a request was made to postpone its implementation. Now that the instruction has been received, the association should, based on laws and regulations and in light of the facts, prepare a document to respond to the Ministry of Finance. The document to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance, mainly drafted by Luo Qinghua, stated that Article 7 of the Savings Bank Law stipulates eight methods for the use of savings bank funds, with clear distinctions and strict boundaries. In law, they are clearly defined as the scope of business, and in fact, they are naturally assets with definite security. The matter is clear and unambiguous. The association should comply with Article 9 of the law and deposit with the Central Bank government bonds and treasury bills equivalent to one-quarter of the total amount of savings deposits, as well as assets with definite security within the scope of business stipulated by law, as security for the repayment of savings deposits. As for the custody plan after depositing with the Central Bank, the Ministry will certainly carefully consider methods to demonstrate credibility, without unnecessary anxiety. However, to increase depositors' confidence and facilitate the access and withdrawal of assets, it is proposed to establish a custodial committee similar to the National Debt Fund Management Committee. In addition to specialists appointed by the Ministry, representatives from the local banking association and other local legal entities should be appointed to jointly organize the committee, so that it can independently exercise its functions within the scope of custody. This would not only encourage national savings but also facilitate banks' access, withdrawal, or exchange of secured assets. It is earnestly requested that the Ministry adopt and implement this proposal, so that all parties can benefit. The association will convene its 54th executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM today to approve the above-mentioned document for issuance. After obtaining approval from the Ministry of Finance, the banks will deposit the public bonds, treasury bills, and other secured assets required by law with the Central Bank. To gather opinions and ensure thoroughness, the association has invited member banks to send representatives to attend today's executive committee meeting and has also invited non-member banks to participate. Copied and distributed: Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Ministry of Finance issued an order to all banking associations on the 13th of this month, following an order from the Executive Yuan, which in turn followed an order from the National Government, to copy and distribute the Savings Bank Law, instructing all member banks to comply. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with the Shanghai Banking Association and learned that the association received the Ministry of Finance's order to copy and distribute the Savings Bank Law on July 31st. The association has already copied and distributed the law to all member banks this morning. Non-member banks have also received copies. Agricultural and Commercial Bank.</p>

<h3>Personnel Sent Abroad to Study Cotton Planting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Departed for the United States on the President Hoover, scheduled to study for two years before returning to China. The Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Council, in view of the lack of cotton planting talent in China, sent students Hu Jingliang and Chen Lanshan to the United States from the Central Cotton Improvement Association to study various disciplines of cotton planting. They boarded a small steamer at the New Customs Wharf at 9:00 AM yesterday, sailed to Pudong, and boarded the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Hoover at 11:00 AM, departing for the United States. Director Deng of the Cotton Industry Control Committee and others sent representatives to see them off at the New Customs Wharf. It is reported that Hu and Chen will study in the United States for two years. Ministry of Finance Rectifies the Currency System</p>
<h3>Import of Foreign Silver Coins Prohibited</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs has been ordered to implement the proclamation. In order to rectify the currency system, the Ministry of Finance, in view of the prevalence of foreign silver coins on the market, including Mexican Silver Dollars, Trade Dollars, Dragon Dollars, and other countries' silver dollar subsidiary coins, has found that Mexican Silver Dollars are silver coins minted in Mexico and sold specifically to China for trade in the East, and the situation is the same for Trade Dollars. Dragon Dollars are currencies that have been abolished by Japan and are not legal tender commonly used in those countries, so their import should be prohibited. As for the silver dollar subsidiary coins of other countries, they cannot be used in China and are only carried by travelers, who exchange them at small money shops after arriving, which is irrelevant to China's monetary policy, so their import need not be prohibited. The Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office has been ordered to comply yesterday and will notify the public. Lujiaxing District.</p>
<h3>Majiabang Embankment Work Progressing Rapidly</h3>
<p>Four sections to be completed within ten days. The embankment repair along Majiabang in Block 43 of the Lujiaxing District of Shanghai, which began on the 4th of this month, has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the work has been underway for ten days. The Municipal Committee Office of the district has specially invited local enthusiastic people, including Mr. Huang Dicheng, as supervisors and has appointed staff member Mr. Xu Renjie as the chief supervisor. The work has been intense in recent days, and four sections have been completed today. According to Mr. Hu Yingchun, the person in charge of the office, there are many obstacles in this project. The office has followed the guidance of the Bureau of Public Works and the supervision of Commissioner Zhang, and has handled matters with perseverance and thoroughness. Fortunately, the project is progressing smoothly. Wang, the director of the fifth precinct of the third district of the Public Security Bureau, has provided strong assistance. His contribution is also commendable. It is reported that this project is a local conscription system and is the first trial run in Shanghai. Therefore, the authorities are paying close attention to it. Mr. Xue, the acting director of the Bureau of Public Works, is examining and guiding this project at any time. Embankment Supervision Committee</p>
<h3>Inspects Hai Embankment Project in Jiading and Taicang</h3>
<p>Solid construction ensures no danger from autumn floods. Datong Company will repair the east embankment of Gaoqiao. The sea embankments of Jiading, Taicang, and Baoshan will be completed soon. Zhang Gongquan, Zhu Kaizhou, and other members of the embankment supervision committee inspected Jiading and Taicang the day before yesterday. The situation of the east embankment of Gaoqiao in Shanghai, which has been contracted for repair by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, is recorded separately as follows.</p>
<h3>Supervision Committee Departs for Inspection</h3>
<p>Since the coastal embankment projects of Jiading, Taicang, Baoshan, and other counties were allocated funds by the Jiangsu Provincial Government this spring, they are about to be completed. Zhang Gongquan, Zhu Kaizhou, and other members of the Jiangnan Embankment Supervision Committee went to Jiading and Taicang the day before yesterday to inspect the repair of the embankments. The construction is solid, and there should be no danger from this year's autumn floods. They will also inspect Baoshan, Nanhui, Chuansha, and other places in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Repair of East Embankment of Gaoqiao Begins</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng attaches great importance to the sea embankments of Shanghai, so he has allocated 200,000 yuan specifically to repair the embankments of Shanghai. Work on the east and west sea embankments will begin in the coming days. As for the east embankment of Gaoqiao District, the terrain is dangerous and was eroded last autumn, posing a risk. Therefore, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has posted a notice for bidding on the foundation stone project for repairs. Drawings can be collected for bidding from the 16th of this month, and the bidding will be opened on the 24th of this month. Construction is expected to begin early next month. National Bureau of Weights and Measures</p>
<h3>Promotes the New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Distributes simplified conversion tables for reference. The National Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industry sent a letter to the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, stating that the publicity materials on weights and measures had already been submitted to the Ministry of Industry, forwarded to the Central Propaganda Committee, and various departments and ministries, ordering their subordinates and all newspapers across the country to publish them on a regular basis to spread the word. Instructions have also been given to various central agencies and municipal governments to follow suit. Although the work of unifying weights and measures across the country is being actively promoted and gradually completed by various central ministries, provincial governments, and municipal governments, ordinary civil servants and the general public still do not fully understand the content of the new system. If only a few lectures and slogans are relied upon, it may be difficult to popularize it. Only by working together and expanding publicity can we achieve great results and facilitate unification. Therefore, we are sending simplified conversion tables of the new Chinese weights and measures system, tables of standard names, and simplified conversion tables of Chinese and foreign weights and measures, three copies each, for your reference, reproduction, and distribution to civil servants of your subordinate agencies and people from all walks of life, one copy per person, for reference and convenient conversion. We also request that you reprint the above three conversion tables on the back or blank pages of your public bulletins or other periodicals, investigation reports, and specialized works, and that you refer to the conversion tables when dealing with matters related to weights and measures in the text, so as to standardize names and facilitate the administration of weights and measures. It is reported that the bureau has instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to instruct the trade associations of various industries to comply. Dependents of Li Du</p>
<h3>Decide to Move to Nanjing</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the dependents of the generals under General Li Du, who returned to China via the Soviet Union, have been living in Shanghai, Beiping, and other places, and their lives are quite difficult. The Executive Yuan had previously decided to send the dependents of General Li and others to Xinjiang via Suiyuan and Ningxia. However, the journey from Ningxia to Dihua was too long, and transportation was inconvenient, making protection difficult, so it was stopped and never realized. According to Mr. Dong Lingge, the secretary of General Li, the dependents of the generals are living in Shanghai and Beiping, and it is difficult to maintain their lives. It is now planned to move to Nanjing temporarily, because the houses of the Northeast Official Bank in Nanjing can provide accommodation and the cost is lower. Negotiations are currently underway, and it is hoped that this will be realized soon.</p>
<h3>Responsibility for the Breach of the Yellow River in Hebei Province</h3>
<p>Lies with the Hebei River Affairs Bureau for failing to provide adequate protection. The news of the breach of the Nine Branch Road under the jurisdiction of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. After the Five Branch Road was repaired, it was inspected and accepted by the central government, the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, and the Hebei Provincial Government. The project was solid and reported to the authorities. At the request of the Hebei Provincial Government, the Construction and Relief Group added to and reinforced the embankment outside the scope of the breach closure project. The project was completed, and the Construction and Relief Group sent personnel to inspect and accept it together with personnel sent by the Hebei Provincial Government. The project was handed over to the Hebei Provincial Government for management, and strict defense was ordered. Now, the sections under the jurisdiction of the Provincial River Affairs Bureau have breached due to inadequate protection for many years, causing the people to suffer repeatedly. This is indeed a dereliction of duty. It is reported that the authorities will investigate and punish them and order them to close the breach within a time limit.</p>
<h3>Two Requests from Jardine Matheson Sailors</h3>
<p>The United Union sale and job security have not been resolved. The shipowner of the Jet Shing who beat up a worker has been resolved. According to the New Voice News Agency, the Jardine Matheson sold the United Union ship, and all the workers requested to continue their service. The union has put forward conditions. The case of the Westerner on the Jet Shing ship beating and insulting a Chinese worker has been resolved through union negotiations. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>United Union Sold</h3>
<p>The Jardine Matheson Yangtze River class United Union ship has been sold to the Sanbei Company for 190,000 yuan due to its age. The ship is scheduled to be handed over this week. However, no attention has been paid to the entire crew of the ship. More than 150 crew members have repeatedly sent representatives to the Seamen's Union and the Shanghai Branch to petition whether the Sanbei will re-employ them after the sale. The union has sent Secretary Sun Liping and Shanghai Branch Committee members Si Shijian and Yang Ruisheng to Jardine Matheson to negotiate and put forward two requirements: (1) All workers should be introduced by Jardine Matheson and re-employed by Sanbei; (2) The remaining workers should be paid three months' severance pay by Jardine Matheson, and Jardine Matheson should make every effort to arrange jobs for them as soon as possible. The company promised to respond when the ship arrives. All workers also insist that if there is no result, they will take effective measures to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Jet Shing Assault</h3>
<p>When the Jardine Matheson Nanhua class Jet Shing ship was anchored in Mawei, Fujian last time, the Western shipowner was inspecting the ship and beat and injured foreman Lu Xiangsheng because he was smoking in the middle cabin, causing a misunderstanding in language. He chained the worker's feet and insulted him arbitrarily. After the workers rescued him and sent him to the hospital, Wu Huan, the director of the Shanghai Branch of the Seamen's Union, believed that the matter concerned the entire working class and that if this precedent was set, Chinese workers would have no protection in the future. Therefore, he negotiated with the company, and the result was: (1) The Westerner beat people for no reason, and the fault lies with the Westerner. The company guarantees that the same thing will not happen again in the future; (2) The injured workers, medical expenses, etc., will be borne by the company; (3) After the worker recovers, he will be allowed to work on the ship as usual. Stevedores of China Merchants Demand Pay Raise</p>
<h3>Shanghai Navigation Mutual Aid Society Expresses its Opinion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Navigation Mutual Aid Society has issued a statement regarding the stevedores' demand for a pay raise from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The stevedores' demand for a pay raise should have legitimate reasons and should not be unreasonable. All commercial rates have certain rules and regulations. Even in times of high prices, they should not be forced to increase for no reason. Moreover, the salaries of the stevedores of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are originally better than those of other companies. When they were hired in the past, they were not hired based on their talents. Most of them used the power of the introducer to determine the salary. After the 18th year, the situation changed. The employees relied on their support and became more lazy in their work. Therefore, after the 18th year, the amount of money lost on goods increased from 200-300 yuan to several thousand yuan each year. The business director suffered a lot. It can be said that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has insight into this and has increased the tonnage to be equal to that of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo, but the income is still not worth the loss. The stevedores are in their positions and eat their salaries. They do not think about their own work and say that the business director has benefited greatly from the employees' request for a pay raise, which is absurd. As for the employees' request for a pay raise because it is not enough to support a family, it is also untrue. There are 6,000 to 7,000 stevedores in Shanghai. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company only accounts for one-tenth of the total, and the salary is higher than the other nine-tenths. Last year, the stevedores of Jardine Matheson went on strike, and the purpose of their request was based on the salary rate set by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which shows that the treatment of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is better than that of any company. If the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wants to raise salaries again, it will inevitably follow suit, and there will be no end to it. In addition, the language on the business director's administrative issues is even more absurd. The employee is responsible for managing freight internally and negotiating externally. The entire stevedore is responsible for handling it. He also said that 70% of the total income of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company depends on the management of the stevedores and other employees, so they should attach great importance to the stevedores and other employees. It is quite a self-righteous feeling. You must know that the above-mentioned responsibilities, that employee is true to his name and works loyally for the salary. It is only natural and not meritorious. It is like the owner of a store, who goes out to do business or collects accounts, and relies on the driver to drive the car. No matter when, the driver must sweat profusely on the road. I have never heard of a driver attacking his master for being comfortable because of his hard work. It is nothing more than different tunes played in the same way, each guarding his own duty. He said that the business director is an amateur and that the form is the same as a virtual setting, which is an unvoiced sound and a public insult. May I ask the director, if he does not have considerable experience, it will not only affect the business of the bureau, but also cause great losses to himself, which is not what the wise man wants to do. If it is really a virtual setting, then the bureau has also been deeply considering this in recent years, so why bother to send another affairs director to replace the business director? The comparison of their work and achievements should have a fair comment. There is no need for the member's tongue to wag. Now that the employee wants to dirty his mouth, why worry about having no words? However, if he does not consider his roots and aligns his ends, it is what the wise man praises. In short, the members of the association have carefully considered the stevedores' request for a pay raise this time. If the stevedores can have precise methods to manage the goods and reduce losses, then each director is also willing to give the employees the money lost. If they only shout about the difficulty of life, there are many people who are worse off than the stevedores of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Why do the stevedores of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company live a poor life? Moreover, the business directors of each ship originally wanted to imitate the methods of European and American sea ships in the autumn of the downturn in the shipping industry and implement the United Profit System, without needing personnel on the ship to receive and dispatch goods, in order to save expenses. Later, because the Navigation Mutual Aid Association took into account the lives of the employees, it tried its best to dissuade them. It had been jointly decided that once the business of each ship improved slightly, another way would be opened to strive to solve the problem and achieve the goal of the employees living comfortably, and a letter of expansion was replied to the Seamen's Branch. This kind of painstaking effort can be described as the ultimate in the friendship between host and guest, but it is not understood and threatened with a strike. Since this case has been submitted to the Ministry of Communications for verification, we can only wait for the ministry's order to resolve it.</p>

<h3>Chinese and Western Bookkeeping Training Class</h3>
<p>In order to promote the bookkeeping skills of factory workers and increase service efficiency, the Shanghai Machinery Association has held a bookkeeping training class for factory personnel and invited accountant Mr. Pan Xulun of Lixin Accounting Firm to be responsible for the training. The first session has ended. In order to continue the training, the association has decided to continue the second session, dividing it into two classes: Chinese-style improved bookkeeping and Western-style elementary bookkeeping, each recruiting 50 students. Chinese-style bookkeeping will be taught by Professor Xu Yongzuo, and Western-style bookkeeping will be taught by Professor Pan Xulun. The class time is from 7:00 to 9:00 PM every night. The Chinese-style class is held every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, and the Western-style class is held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The tuition fee for the Chinese-style class is 6 yuan, and the tuition fee for the Western-style class is 12 yuan. (If it is guaranteed by the member factory of the association, the fee will be reduced by half.) Registration starts from now until August 31st. The class will start on September 1st. The end date is November 30th for the Chinese-style class and January 31st of the 24th year for the Western-style class. Both men and women are accepted.

<h3>The Beggar Relief Association Actively Rescues Beggars</h3>
<p>Starting with the collection of women and children beggars, the Shanghai Beggar Relief Association has been actively engaged since its establishment on April 10th of this year, negotiating with various charitable organizations on the principle of division of labor and cooperation, regularly cleaning up the beggars in Shanghai, and stipulating that women and children should be collected first. In order to protect motherhood, the Women and Children Rehabilitation Center attached to the China Women's Temperance Society in Jiangwan will take in female beggars who beg with babies in their arms. As for male and female child beggars, the association is planning to write to the Child Welfare Association and the Children's Welfare Committee, two charitable organizations, to find ways to take them in. School starts in the middle of the term.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Credit Lending Busy</h3>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Road branch of the Shanghai Bank in Shanghai was the first to launch credit lending, which has been going on for four or five years. Borrowers only need to have good credit and a definite income for legitimate purposes to borrow up to 500 yuan from the bank. The procedures are simple, the interest rate is low, and the head office and ten branches in Shanghai can collect the repayments each time, which is very convenient for borrowers. Recently, as the school season is approaching, parents are feeling difficult to raise huge amounts of tuition fees for their children to enter school, and they are applying for credit loans from the bank. It is reported that the bank is allocating people and speeding up its work. The business is busy and there is a scene of being overwhelmed. The guards opened fire.</p>
<h3>Worker Fell into River and Drowned from Fright Case</h3>
<p>Rescheduled for Further Hearing on the 18th. On June 8th of this year, at 2 PM, a conflict occurred in Longhua Town between the "local gang" (本帮) and the "Shanyang gang" (山陽帮) over the position of foreman for coal carriers at the Bao Tai Silk Factory. The Shanyang gang foreman, Hu Yude, and the local gang foreman, Tang Liangen, along with Ji Xiaomao, each gathered a large number of people, as if facing a major enemy. The Ninth District Party Headquarters in the town, hearing the news and fearing a major disaster, immediately notified Wu Shou Kang (also known as Wu Ruqi), the head of the Security Corps, who dispatched armed corps members Wu Youcai, Wu Yinxiang, Tang Zuxian, Wu Fusheng, and others to suppress the situation. Some of the guest gang workers created difficulties for the Security Corps, so corps member Tang Zuxian fired three shots into the air, and the workers then retreated. Afterwards, Hu Yude, the guest gang foreman, along with witness Song Yongqing, filed a lawsuit with the local court against Wu Shou Kang, Wu Youcai, Wu Yinxiang, Tang Zuxian, Wu Fusheng, and Tang Liangen (also known as Ji Wenbin) for firing the shots. They claimed that worker Qi Desheng was working, carrying coal from the boat to the shore on a gangplank, when he fell into the river from fright upon hearing the gunshots and drowned, with his body missing. They requested a thorough investigation. The case was initially examined by Prosecutor Wu Delying, and then Wu Shou Kang, Tang Liangen, Ji Xiaomao, Wu Youcai, Wu Yinxiang, Tang Zuxian, Wu Fusheng, and others were prosecuted under Article 291 of the Criminal Law for homicide. The details of the open trial, which remained unresolved, have been reported previously. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Shao specially convened a continued hearing in the Tenth Court. The plaintiff's private prosecution attorney, Liu Xiang, and the defendants' attorneys, Pan Zhensheng and Zhu Fang, were all present in court. Witnesses from both sides also appeared as summoned. Attorney Liu stated that the deceased's uncle had sent a letter stating that the deceased was usually quite unruly and did not seem to want to pursue the matter rigorously, indicating that a settlement of the private prosecution portion was possible outside of court. Attorney Pan rose and denied the possibility of settling the private prosecution, stating that since there was no death, the public prosecution could not stand, and there was no basis for a private prosecution. The judge questioned Hu Yude and others briefly, and then instructed the attorneys for both sides that the police investigation report had only been received today. The hearing was now rescheduled for 8 AM on the 18th of this month, and all parties were to appear on time. After issuing the order, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Proposes Disaster Prevention Plan</h3>
<p>The Lake Society of Guizhou Road in the city, in view of the fact that the six counties under the jurisdiction of the Lake have suffered from alternating floods and droughts in recent years, and the people's livelihood is exhausted, and this year's drought is particularly harmful, the principles underlying this are due to the siltation of river channels and the lack of storage and discharge, resulting in a situation where the disaster of water and drought is viewed with indifference, and there are no measures to defend against it. Now, it is heard that the society, for the sake of alleviating the water and drought disasters in the six counties under the jurisdiction of the Lake, has specially submitted a request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and sent letters to the six county governments under the jurisdiction of the Lake, suggesting relief measures: (1) It is proposed to select key locations on the upper reaches of the East and West Tiaoxi Rivers to build dams to store water, and the downstream can take advantage of this winter to extensively conscript labor to dredge the rivers. In addition to the Daqian and Xiaomei mouths of the Lougang tail gate, the opening and closing should be restored immediately. (2) It is proposed to order the six county governments under the jurisdiction of the Lake to open more branch canals and small ports in the enclosed fields under their jurisdiction to facilitate irrigation and benefit transportation. (3) For the bridge openings built along the highways, if there is a reduction in the area of the river channel, it is proposed to order them to be rebuilt and expanded to facilitate storage and discharge. (4) It is found that there is an item for pest control expenses in the additional tax on field taxes in each county. The accumulated amount over the years should be considerable. Considering that the disasters in the Lake area over the years have been mostly water and drought, and there are few pest infestations, it is now proposed to transfer the accumulated funds to purchase water pumping machines. If there is a water or drought disaster, the county governments will distribute them to each district for use to provide relief, so that both the root and the branch are taken care of, and it is done once and for all. Zhang Jilan's Fraudulent Acquisition of Farmland Case</p>
<h3>Appeal Changes Sentence to Six Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Intending to illegally possess property, using fraudulent means to induce others to hand over their belongings. Zhang Jilan, a wealthy businessman from Jiangwan, under the guise of being the Director of General Affairs of the International Sports Association, acquired over 230 mu of farmland in the (Yin Jiu) and (Yin Eleven) districts of Jiangwan during the tenth year of the Republic. Subsequently, he was sued by the original landowners in the local court. The case was suspended for several years. The initial trial declared him innocent. The municipal government then sent a letter to the judicial authorities requesting a review. On April 16th of this year, Zhang, accompanied by his lawyer, appeared in court. He was detained and taken into custody. He was sentenced to five years of penal servitude for robbery. Zhang disagreed with the verdict and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. He then petitioned to be released on bail. Chief Judge Hu ruled that he was allowed to be released on bail with a written guarantee of 60,000 yuan. Zhang then entrusted Chu Peizhi of Hengtai Yuan Foreign Cloth Store on Pishi Street in Suzhou, Chen Qitang of Futai Xiang Southern Goods Store in the Xiaocai Market outside the Chaimen Gate, Pu Yunshi of Zhenhe Electrical Material Store in Guanqian, Xu Chenglong of Xu Qia Tai Copper and Tin Store on Daoqian Street, and Gu Shaoqing of Jiangsu Inn to be responsible for the written guarantee of 60,000 yuan on July 2nd and to be responsible for being available whenever summoned. The case has already been argued and is scheduled for sentencing. It is now heard that the case was judged the day before yesterday. Appellant Zhang Jilan did not report. Chief Judge Hu came to the court to announce the verdict. In the case of Zhang Jilan's appeal against robbery, the main text of the verdict is that the original verdict is revoked. Zhang Jilan, intending to illegally possess property, uses fraudulent means to induce others to hand over their belongings and is sentenced to six months of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the final judgment is reduced by one day for every two days of imprisonment. Electrocution During Heavy Rain for Car</p>
<h3>Chen Ruikang Dies Tragically from Electrocution</h3>
<p>Chen Ruikang, a native of Ningbo, twenty years old, lived at No. 14 Yucai Road, Hongkou. He was a carpenter at the car shop opened by Zhang Ronggen at No. 371 Tianbao Road. At around 7 PM the day before yesterday, Chen Ruikang was connecting wires to a car when he was electrocuted. At that time, there was a heavy downpour and loud thunder. Chen was immediately electrocuted and died on the spot. Yesterday morning, the Third Precinct of the Fifth District ordered Ling Renjie, the local security officer of the 15th Tu of the 23rd Bao, to report to the local court for inspection. Prosecutor Li Fen and the coroner arrived at the scene to verify the death. Instructions were given to prepare the coffin and await further instructions. The night before last, on Bailinan Road</p>
<h3>Robbery Occurs on the Road</h3>
<p>A robbery occurred on Bailinan Road (now Baoding Road) in the west of Shanghai, in front of the Chenliu Villa (near the Suzhou River) west of Zhoujiaqiao, at around 9 PM the night before last. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper, but there were slight discrepancies with the facts, so we are supplementing them below. Shao Tansheng, a native of Huangdu, twenty-nine years old, currently lives in the club at the intersection of Hubilan Road (now Huaihai West Road) and Lincoln Road in the west of Shanghai. At around 9 PM the night before last, Shao returned home from Shanghai and transferred to a rickshaw pulled by Wang Xiaofan, a native of Chongming, at Zhoujiaqiao. When he arrived in front of the Chenliu Villa (near the Suzhou River) west of Chenjiadu, two robbers wearing black clothes and speaking the Jiangbei dialect jumped out of the darkness and blocked Shao's way. They threatened him with guns. Shao saw that the situation was not good and shouted for help. One robber slashed Shao's head with a knife, and the other robber fired a gun, injuring his right leg. The two robbers then snatched the undershirt Shao had purchased and fled west. Afterwards, rickshaw puller Wang Xiaofan pulled Shao to Beixinjing Town and reported to the First Precinct of the Sixth District. Chief Hong Zhen, upon receiving the report, immediately sent Shao Tansheng in a car to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. He also supervised patrol officer Lin Naiyou to personally investigate the scene of the incident. It was found that the area was under the jurisdiction of the Sixth District General Office. Later, police officer Guo Chengfa of the Fifth Post arrested a suspect, Miao Tairan, at the intersection of Lincoln Road and Lobegen Road (now Luoben Lane). After a brief interrogation by Chief Hong, he was transferred to the Sixth District General Office for interrogation along with rickshaw puller Wang Xiaofan. Yesterday's newspaper mistakenly reported that police officers from the Sixth District Police Station in Chenjiadu arrested the suspect Miao Tairan, which was not true.</p>

<h3>To Review "The Good Earth" Film</h3>
<p>The film "The Good Earth," shot in China by the American Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film company, has been edited since being transported to America and is about to be screened. Because the company was concerned that Chinese people might have different opinions on the film, the company sent a telegram to China requesting that someone be sent to America to review the entire plot. If there were any inappropriate scenes, they could be removed. The Central Film Censorship Committee approved the request and specially sent General Du Tingxiu to America for review. General Du departed from Shanghai on the President Hoover of the Dollar Steamship Lines the day before yesterday afternoon. He will first go to Los Angeles and then to Hollywood. Female Pirate, Japanese Yamato Nadeshiko</p>
<h3>Flees to Hong Kong with Large Sum of Money</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun on the 14th, Nakamura Sueko (renamed Yamato Nadeshiko), a native of Hokkaido, Japan, twenty-four years old, was previously married to a Chinese merchant, Zheng Wencai, and lived in Keelung before moving to Fuzhou. She had two children. Later, she was abducted by Zheng's godson, Chen Bailin, and fled to Xiaomayu Island in Nanri Island to become a pirate, specializing in robbing passing ships. The woman was cunning and always carried a pistol in her hakama (a type of Japanese trousers), commanding the pirates and rampaging at sea. Therefore, merchant ships traveling to and from Keelung feared her. In mid-May of this year, she kidnapped the Keelung trade delegation outside Haikou County, Fuqing. After being severely suppressed by the Chinese navy, she gradually lost power. Seeing that the situation was gone, the woman said that in order to regain her former power, she had to purchase new and sophisticated equipment. In mid-July, she used the excuse of purchasing weapons and secretly took 35,000 yuan in cash to Xiamen to discuss with Chen's brother. Chen's brother believed her to be true. Unexpectedly, the woman, longing for her children, secretly went to Fuzhou. Before long, she took the money and fled to Hong Kong. As a result, the pirates of Nanri Island suffered a major blow due to the loss of a large sum of cash. West Bao Xing Road</p>
<h3>Midnight Shooting Case</h3>
<p>Zhang Er's injuries are serious. The three murderers have escaped. Zhang Er, a native of Songjiang, thirty-six years old, used to be a foreman in the Jiuji Construction Factory. After losing his job, he was unemployed and living at home. Zhang A-san, a native of Taizhou, worked as a scissor sharpener. He married Zhao, who is now thirty years old and lives in a straw house without a number next to the Vagrant Shelter on West Baoxing Road in Zhabei. During the January 28th Incident, Zhang A-san was so frightened that he suffered a nervous breakdown and could not work, resulting in an increasingly dire situation. Meals were intermittent. In order to take care of the lives of the two, Zhao had an affair with Zhang Er. At that time, Zhang Er and Zhang Chengfa, a local, made a living by planting vegetables there. After having an affair with Zhao, Zhang Er moved into Zhao's house, eating and sleeping together, like husband and wife. Zhang A-san remained unharmed. Yesterday morning, at about 3 AM, when Zhang Er was fast asleep, the farmland was barking non-stop. Zhang Er thought that thieves had come, so he hurriedly got up and opened the door to investigate. Unexpectedly, as soon as he stepped out of the door, three men jumped out from his side, pulled out pistols, and fired two shots at him before fleeing in a panic. Zhang Er was caught off guard and was immediately hit by two bullets, one in the lower abdomen and one grazing his chest. He immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. When Zhang Chengfa heard the gunshots and came out to see, the murderers had already escaped. He rushed to report to the police, who then reported to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau. The police were dispatched to investigate the scene and took Zhang Er to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. His injuries were serious, and his life was in danger. The police dispatched detectives to track down the criminals. The reason for the murder is unknown, but according to neighbors, it may have been caused by jealousy.</p>
<h3>Iron Chain Locks Wife</h3>
<p>Wife Jumps Out of Window to Report to Police. Fang Shuiquan's Actions Are Illegal. Fang Shuiquan, a native of Pudong, lives in a flat at No. 24 Liujiazhai, Pu'enjishi Road, French Concession. He is twenty-four years old and works as a plasterer. He married Li, whose given name is Jindi, from the same village. Li is seventeen years old. Their feelings are weak. On the 12th of this month, at 7 AM, Fang dragged Li out of the house and took her to No. 139 on the same road. That afternoon, he hired a car and took her to the third floor of No. 3, Tongle Fang, on the same road and locked her up. The couple stayed there overnight. The next morning at 7 AM, Fang locked Li's left foot and right hand with an iron chain, preventing her from moving. He then went out to work. After Fang left, Li jumped out of the window and reported to the French police on the street, requesting that her husband be arrested and investigated. The head of the police ordered someone to remove the chain and sent detectives Jiang Changwen and Yang Yilong, along with the Bao detective Dai Rongji, to arrest Fang Shuiquan. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case, stating that the defendant used an iron chain to lock the plaintiff's hands and feet, obstructing her freedom. The police still need to investigate, so he requested a postponement for further investigation and prosecution. Li Jindi stated that when she was fourteen years old, her parents betrothed her to the defendant. Because the Japanese were fighting, she followed him to his home in the countryside. She was raped and forced to marry him. This time, because she went to her mother's house and stayed there for about a month, she was lured out, locked up, and imprisoned. She requested an investigation. Fang Shuiquan confessed that his wife had run away a year ago and he had just found her. To prevent her from running away again, he locked her up. Judge Li Changnian verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained for further investigation on the 18th of this month. After 600,000 Red Pills Were Confiscated</p>

Zhang Chaogang, a native of Danyang, is a conductor at the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau and lives at No. 47 Shengsunli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. Because of his frequent contact with a group of drug dealers in the concession, Zhang eventually set up a red pill trafficking organization in his home.

<h3>Forcibly Violates Prostitute</h3>
<p>Zhang Er-nan Unable to Resist. Accuses Uncle and Appeals to the Court. -Because the Case is Related to Public Morality, Public Hearing is Prohibited- Shi Jinnan is of unknown origin. Usually, after official duties, he would frequent brothels. Ms. Lao San, the owner of the Hong Mei Hua brothel at No. 5 Xifuzhi Lane, Yunnan Road, is one of Shi's favorite. Recently, Lao San had a new maid, Ye Zhang Er-nan, only seventeen years old, from Suzhou. She was beautiful and slender, and still a virgin, and was appreciated by Shi. He wanted to have her. He discussed it with Lao San. Fearing that Zhang would not agree, he thought of a clever plan. The night before last, Shi went to room No. 431 of the Yangzi Hotel on Yunnan Road. He wrote a ticket summoning Zhang. Lao San ordered the prostitute Dong Lindi (eighteen years old, from Suzhou) to respond, and instructed Zhang to follow. After arriving at the room, Shi flirted with Zhang, and Dong Lindi, who had been hinted at by Lao San, pretended to sleep on the sofa, allowing Shi to do as he pleased. Seeing an opportunity, Shi closed the door and forcibly raped Zhang. Zhang shouted and resisted, but Lindi assisted the evildoer, so Zhang had no ability to resist. Shi achieved his goal. Lao San also came to talk to Shi in the early morning. After a moment, they separated. Zhang Er-nan was wronged. She ran to tell her uncle, who entrusted lawyer Xi Yafu to report to the Lao Zha police station. Detective Feng Xiushan was sent to arrest Shi Jinnan and Hong Mei Hua's Lao San. Only Dong Lindi was arrested and taken back to the police station and sent to the women's prison. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a public prosecution according to Article 246 of the Criminal Law. Because the case was related to public morality, he requested that the public be prohibited from attending the hearing. Judge Zhan Liangce approved the request, so the content of the trial could not be learned. A Rubber-Soled Shoe Strike</p>

<h3>Tailor Seduces Young Woman</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Four Years Imprisonment. Pan Zhaoyun, a foreman at the Zhanglanji Construction Factory, a native of Pudong, forty-three years old, lives at No. 162 Mabalukou, Xiaoshadu Road, West Shanghai. He has a daughter named Yuqing, who is two or eight, beautiful, and has been betrothed to a man from the same village. The wedding will be held soon. Lu Zhusheng, a native of Pudong, twenty-one years old, is a tailor. In March of this year, Lu worked in the area of Pan's old house in Pudong, which led to his acquaintance with Pan's daughter Yuqing. On the 27th of last month, at about 1 PM, Pan Yuqing suddenly disappeared and did not return for several days. Her father searched everywhere but found no news. Although he suspected that Lu Zhusheng was involved, there was no evidence, so he had to investigate secretly. On the 4th of this month, he reported the situation to the Putuo Road police station. Until the day before yesterday (the 12th), Pan Zhaoyun learned that his daughter was living in Jiangwan Town, so he rushed to take Yuqing back. Under questioning, it was found that she had been seduced by Lu Zhusheng. That afternoon, Yuqing went out shopping alone and met Lu Zhusheng, who talked to her intimately, promising her that he had no wife and wished to marry her, vowing to treat her well. Yuqing was young and ignorant, and easily persuaded. She and Lu fled together and rented a house in Jiangwan, where they lived together. Her virginity was lost at that time. After living together for less than two weeks, Zhaoyun's thorough investigation led to his daughter's return. However, Lu was out at the time, so he escaped. Pan Zhaoyun went to the police station to report after finding his daughter. Hua detective Chen Hongbin and Bao detective Yuan Xinzhong paid close attention to the investigation. Lu Zhusheng returned home that night. Not seeing Yuqing, he knew that things had been exposed. But he was still infatuated with her and did not care about the consequences. He rushed back to Shanghai the day before yesterday, intending to meet her again to express his feelings. He was met by detectives on Xinzha Road, who arrested Lu and took him to the police station. After interrogation, he confessed and was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, the victim was brought to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that Pan's daughter had been sent to Guangren Hospital for examination yesterday, and it was confirmed that her hymen had been ruptured, and she had been raped. Furthermore, Pan's daughter was under the age of sixteen. Therefore, the police are now prosecuting the defendant under Article 257 of the Criminal Law for abduction and Article 240, Section 2, for rape. Pan Zhaoyun and his daughter Yuqing complained about being seduced by Lu, and claimed that Yuqing was sixteen years old, born on the 22nd day of the fourth lunar month of the abolished calendar, a sheep, and requested a severe punishment. Lu Zhusheng confessed to having a relationship with the woman, but claimed that it was with her consent and not forced. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession and ordered Pan's daughter to go to the forensic office for examination. However, the examination was unsuccessful because Pan's daughter was menstruating. Judge Wu ruled that the case was clear and, after hearing the arguments of the lawyers on both sides, sentenced Lu Zhusheng to four years imprisonment for having sexual relations with a woman under the age of sixteen, with a reduced sentence. Yuqing was taken back by her father. Children's Welfare Society</p>
<h3>The Protection Department of the Children's Welfare Society Rescues Abducted Children</h3>
<p>Wei Xiaoyang Abducts Many Boys and Girls and Has Been Apprehended and Sent to the Public Security Bureau for Investigation. The Children's Welfare Committee's Children's Protection Department has begun operating in the First Nursery, with several staff members specializing in investigating and rescuing children. On August 4th, the department received a tip that in the bamboo gate in the open space behind the Old West Gate Xiangsheng Automobile Company, there were thugs who specialize in luring lost women and children and engaging in various illegal activities. The department sent two staff members, Yin Chao and Li Bingyan, to investigate. They saw a child walking out, with the words "天天雨" newly tattooed on his left arm. Yin Chao and others found him suspicious and asked him questions. They learned that swindlers Wei Xiaoyang and others had lured six or seven boys and girls, all calling them uncles, and forced them to beg on the streets during the day. They had also recently lured an old woman to live with them. Wei Xiaoyang and others were like local tyrants, enjoying warmth and food. After the child finished speaking, he ran into the bamboo gate in a hurry. Yin Chao and others followed him, pretending to be the owner of the property, ordering them to move out quickly. They saw more than ten men and women of all ages, all speaking vaguely, and claimed that a week ago, they had bought a child for ten cents. Yin Chao and others found the situation strange and reported it to the First District Office, who arrested three abducted women, four men including Wei Xiaoyang, and two children. It was claimed that four other children had gone out begging and had not been found. The Second District Office considered the case to involve abduction and sent it to the Public Security Bureau and then to the court for investigation. Municipal Finance Bureau</p>
<h3>Repercussions of Taxing Tobacco and Liquor Licenses</h3>
<p>Small Tobacco Shops Oppose Doubling of Taxes　　Association Holds Meeting to Discuss Relief Measures The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance is receiving tobacco and liquor license taxes and is determined to collect them in accordance with regulations. However, the tobacco industry is largely comprised of small family-run shops that sell tobacco and cigarettes. Their business is small and the shops are close together, creating competition in pricing, which makes it difficult to profit. According to the person in charge of the industry association, the investigation and collection by various tax offices,</p>
<p>reveals significant inequality in treatment. In the four suburban areas bordering the city and counties, such as Jiangwan, Wusong, Zhenru, Caohejing, Fahua, Caojiadu, Longhua, etc., larger tobacco and liquor businesses with double-front shops only pay two yuan per household, and even the largest sauce gardens only pay eight yuan. However, small shops in the city, both inside and outside the city walls, and in areas like Lan Ni Du in Pudong, which previously paid two or four yuan per quarter, are now required to pay double the amount. This has caused widespread resentment, with everyone expressing pain and suffering. In recent days, parts of Nanshi, Pudong, Xujiahui, and Caojiadu have all drafted letters with official seals, stating their addresses and door numbers, and have sent their old summer licenses and autumn temporary receipts to the Shanghai South Office of the Tobacco Association, making a firm request to stop this action. The office has scheduled a meeting of officers from all districts tomorrow at 2:00 PM to discuss relief plans, and has sent letters to all officers stating: According to members Damin of Anlan Road, Yuanli of Dasheng Lane, Yutai of Chezhan Road, Ding Ruitae of Lao Bai Du Street, and hundreds of others who have sent letters stating that after the Finance Bureau took over the autumn licenses, it first ordered registration, then investigated the class, and then set a deadline for obtaining licenses. Due to the tight deadline, many people were crowded out and unable to register and obtain licenses on time. Some even had their old license taxes stolen or lost. Subsequently, they were charged overdue fines and double taxes, with some being increased several times over. Our shops' capital and business are not even as good as the average stall vendor's. Recently, there have been many shops next to each other, making it difficult to profit. It is already difficult to maintain business by reluctantly paying two yuan per quarter. In the midst of this economic depression, we cannot bear the heavy burden of double taxes. Therefore, we are sending our old licenses and temporary receipts with this letter, hoping that your association will forward them to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and petition the authorities to uphold Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit, support small and weak businesses, and consider the difficulties of the people's livelihood. We ask that you show compassion for small tobacco merchants and quickly resolve this issue so that they can conduct business and maintain their livelihoods. We believe that your association, as the leader of the industry, will surely understand the difficulties of the times and convey our situation. We trust that the authorities will not make things difficult for small businesses. If they continue to disregard the difficulties of businesses, we will have no choice but to stand firm and wait for death. Therefore, after investigating this case, which affects the entire city's tobacco and liquor industries, which is a major issue, our office is unable to act on its own authority. We have invited all officers to discuss relief plans and report them to the executive committee for handling. We also request that a meeting of representatives from the eleven tobacco and liquor associations be convened immediately to gather wisdom and benefit both the tax authorities and businesses. To prevent misunderstandings among our members and avoid escalating disputes, we have specifically scheduled a meeting at 2:00 PM on the fourth day of this week (August 16) to discuss solutions for reporting. Please be sure to attend on time, as there are other important matters to be discussed. In addition to distributing letters separately, this special letter is being sent to you. Please take note of this matter, Bodhi Society.</p>
<h3>Translating Tibetan Scriptures</h3>

<h3>Western Monk Zhao Kong Leaves Shanghai</h3>
<p>It is now known that Western monk Zhao Kong, who resided at Longtan Temple, returned to Shanghai after being deported from Europe and stayed at the Astor House Hotel. Afterwards, his whereabouts were unknown to the outside world. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Datong News Agency inquired with local Buddhist organizations and learned that Zhao Kong had led his male and female disciples to Beijing last month. Initially, they planned to stay at Qixia Temple in the capital, but the temple did not receive them because their actions had attracted the attention of the military and police agencies in the capital. It is now known that they have returned to Longtan Temple in Longtan Town to stay. As for his former residence at Jue Lu on the Great Western Road, it has long been rented out. It is also known that when Zhao Kong left Shanghai for Europe in March of this year, he sent a letter to local Buddhist organizations, saying goodbye and expressing his great wishes. The letter is recorded below: To the Chinese Buddhist Association, Shanghai Buddhist Association, Buddhist Pure Land Society, Buddhist Laymen's Forest, Jiguang Amitabha Society, and all temples and monasteries in China, all great monks, all nuns, all Buddhist assemblies, and all great laymen, greetings. Your student led his male and female disciples to China to beg for precepts, and was honored to receive a warm welcome, banquets, alms, and various preferential treatments from your seat and various organizations. We are deeply grateful. Now, we are all about to return to our country and wish to introduce Chinese Mahayana Buddhism to Europeans and choose a convenient location to build a largest Buddhist temple for Europeans to convert to Buddhism and learn from it. However, we and others are new to the Taoist path and have not been ordained for long, and we do not know the doctrines of Buddhism. Afterwards, we still ask your seat for compassion and guidance from time to time to correct our shortcomings. Respectfully, Zhao Kong monk.</p>

<h3>Assault on Coffee King Case</h3>
<p>New New and Other Coffee Shops Unite to Protest　　Write to the Taxpayers' Association Asking for Reasonable Negotiations The incident at 73 Hualong Road (Coffee King), where three soldiers from the French Barracks went to drink beer on the afternoon of the 5th of this month and refused to pay for it, and the owner, Sheng Gongxu, was brutally beaten and seriously injured, has been reported in various newspapers. It is now known that the nearby coffee shops are protesting against the unreasonable behavior of the French soldiers and have jointly sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession yesterday, asking for reasonable negotiations. The original text is copied below: Dear Sirs, It is a fact that our country has been repeatedly bound by unequal treaties, and our compatriots in the concession are often in danger of having no protection. Mr. Sheng Gongxu, the owner of the Coffee King, suffered an attack on the afternoon of the 5th of this month at 9:00 PM, when three soldiers from the French Barracks on Fuli Road went to drink beer and refused to pay for it when asked. They then rushed out the door and brutally beat him, causing serious injuries. Mr. Sheng is a highly educated intellectual, currently serving as a design committee member of the National Government's Construction Committee and a professor at the Shanghai French Law School. We are deeply indignant at this unprovoked assault. We believe that your association is the only organization in the concession that can uphold justice for our Chinese people. In our capacity as fellow businesses, we respectfully request that you provide practical assistance to achieve the following three objectives: (1) Punish the perpetrators; (2) Provide compensation; (3) Ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. In fact, this is just one recent incident. The harassment we have suffered in the past is countless and deeply hateful. These French soldiers have something to rely on. They not only owe money and refuse to pay, but also act savagely and violently, and make false accusations and slanders. There is always a danger of being ordered to close down. The weak people are suffering under oppression. Therefore, we sincerely request that your association speak out for our compatriots and provide protection to all, so that we can live and work in peace. We are deeply grateful. Respectfully, New New Coffee Shop, Heli Hotel, Hongbin Hotel, and others.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>▲ The History of the Xu Garden Lantern Art Exhibition. The Xu Garden Lantern Art Exhibition on Connaught Road in this city has been crowded with visitors for days, and it is famous throughout Chun Shen. This lantern is not comparable to the small-style lanterns made of silk and paper sold in the market. Those who are good at this art are mostly people in the silk industry. In the heyday of the silk industry, taking Haining and Xiashi as examples, there were as many as forty or fifty silk shops. People from Ningbo accounted for the majority of people in the silk industry. Every autumn and winter season is a very idle time, so a group of famous lantern makers has been created, which has continued to this day for sixty or seventy years. In recent years, the silk industry has suffered a miserable defeat. This group of people is idle at home. This year, Haining held a grand event, which was all created by this group of people. The lanterns displayed in Xu Garden this time, including pavilions and towers, number more than twenty, each costing four or five hundred gold. Those who watch the lanterns should know the history of Haining lanterns and should not regard them as ordinary lantern festivals. According to legend, when the Qing Dynasty Emperor Qianlong made three southern tours, Chen Di of Haining was also fortunate three times. At that time, the country was peaceful and the people were happy, and the people took joy in competing with lanterns. The lantern festival in Haining began from then on.</p>

<h3>Reading Q&amp;A</h3>
<h3>Reading (Errors and Doubts in the Translated Version) (Four Continuations, Continued on the Eleventh)</h3>
<p>Q: What does "Dalmiduo" mean on page 378, line 7?</p>
<p>A: The original text is Tarmidor, a term transferred from French, originally meaning "February," referring to the February Revolution in France. The February Revolution overthrew Napoleon's imperial system and restored the democratic system, so "Dalmi" also has the meaning of democratic restoration.</p>
<p>Q: I cannot completely understand the sentence on page 384, line 5: "Because the law reflects the nature of the relationship that develops in the contradiction in the totality of all relationships."</p>
<p>A: This sentence can be translated as: "Because the law reflects the nature of the relationship of the phenomenon that develops according to the contradiction in the totality of all relationships."</p>
<p>Q: What does "(...separated by the realm of conditional conditions)" mean on page 384, line 8?</p>
<p>A: Things are not absolutely different from each other. The differences are only relative aspects. For example, humans and dogs are different, but only in certain aspects, that is, humans have reason and dogs do not. We cannot therefore say that dogs and humans are absolutely different, because dogs and humans are both animals, and this is always the same. The difference between dogs and humans is different under certain conditions. The so-called "(separated by the realm of conditional conditions)" refers to this.</p>
<p>Q: On page 385, line 8: "(An essence develops through the essence of phenomena) Essence, and the essence in the phenomenon, it seems that there are two essences."</p>
<p>A: The former "(essence)" is a noun, and the latter "(essential)" is an adjective, not two things.</p>
<p>Q: What does "(false construction)" mean on page 416, line 7?</p>
<p>A: That is, a false construction.</p>
<p>Q: What does "(and pieces)" mean on page 434, line 1?</p>
<p>A: "(And pieces)" means "(existing conditions)" or ready-made conditions.</p>
<p>Q: Why did "(the most adaptable organism perish, and the organism that is not so adaptable survive)" on the last two lines of page 465?</p>
<p>A: This refers to accidental individual events. The most adaptable individual may sometimes perish accidentally, but if we do not speak from individual accidental events, but from the entire organism, this sentence is naturally untenable. At that time, the most suitable will definitely be able to survive (inevitably).</p>
<p>Q: What does "(Sang softness)" mean on page 514, line 1?</p>
<p>A: That is, the meaning of "(can change freely)."</p>
<p>Q: What does "(also will try to (on all media) to grasp the object)" mean on the last line of page 514 to the first line of page 515?</p>
<p>A: We cannot regard the object as dead, so we must grasp it from the aspect of shifting changes. One thing shifts and becomes another thing, and there is a kind of medium in between. So it is said that we must grasp it from the medium.</p>
<p>Q: Please explain in detail "(liberate this process from accidental phenomenon forms)" on the last four lines of page 518.</p>
<p>A: That is, do not simply regard this process as an accidental phenomenon, but you must find the essential and inevitable laws of the process from the accidental phenomenon.</p>
<p>Q: What does "(class edge)" mean on the last four lines of page 518?</p>
<p>A: Being similar to each other, being related to each other, then the interrelationship of the phenomena.</p>
<p>Q: On page 539, line 4: "(Although the general regularity of people existing as individuals, is not existing) Please explain.</p>
<p>The character "(Although)" is a mistake for the character for "leaving". (End)</p>

<h3>Following Trends and Returning to the Past</h3>
<p>— Kang Bodu</p>
<p>Mr. Bannong's death, like the deaths of the two writers Zhu Xiang and Lu Yin, caused some publications to become lively. How long will this situation last? It is impossible to predict now. But this death seems to have a much greater effect than those two: he is about to be crowned as a virtuous predecessor who returns to the past, and his spirit tablet can be used to attack people who (follow trends).</p>
<p>This attack is powerful, because he is both a deceased celebrity and a former member of the new party. Using the new to attack the new is like fighting poison with poison, which is better than bringing out rusty antiques. However, the joke is also lurking in this. Why? Because Mr. Bannong was first a person who became famous for (following trends).</p>
<p>The reason why the youth of the past had the three words Liu Bannong in their minds was not because he was good at phonology or often wrote limericks, but because he jumped out of the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly School, scolded Wang Jingxuan, and was a fighter in the (literary revolution) camp. However, at that time, some people毀之為(attacked him as) (following trends). The times seemed to be progressing a little bit after all, and as time passed, this posthumous title was gradually washed away, and he climbed up a little bit himself, and became more easy-going, and finally became a clean celebrity. But, (people are afraid of being famous and pigs are afraid of being strong), he is now going to be wrapped up as a medicine to cure the new disease of (following trends).</p>
<p>This is not Mr. Bannong's alone. There are indeed old examples. There are many Guangdong scholars, so why is Kang Youwei so famous? Because he was the head of the public car to write a letter, the protagonist of the Wuxu coup, following trends; there are not many British students, Yan Fu's name has not disappeared, because he earnestly translated several devil books before, following trends; In the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Taiyan was not the only one who studied Park Xue, and his reputation was far above Sun Yirang's, because he advocated racial revolution, following trends, and (rebellion). Later, (time) also (followed) over, and they became living, pure predecessors. But, bad luck also came along, Kang Youwei was permanently designated as the ancestor of the restoration, Emperor Yuan wanted Yan Fu to persuade him to enter, and Marshal Sun Chuanfang also came to invite Mr. Taiyan to throw pots. He was originally a good hand at pulling the car forward, his calves were big and his arms were thick. This time, he was still asked to pull, and he was still pulling, but he was pulling the car with his ass backwards. Here, I had to use ancient prose, (Wuhu Ai Zai, Shang Xiang).</p>
<p>I am not mocking Mr. Bannong for ever (following trends). What I am using here is a part of the commonly called (following trends): the meaning of (forerunner). Although he admitted to (falling), he actually fought over it. As long as those who love him promote this point more, and don't do things chaotically, and specialize in dragging him into the oil or mud that you like to use as a gold-lettered signboard.</p>
<h3>Tracing the History of Mass Language Literature (Below)</h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan said in an article on the rhyme of national customs: (Today's opera, Zhili has Beijing Opera, Shanxi has Bangzi Opera, Anhui has Huizhou Opera, Hubei has Han Opera, Sichuan has Yu Opera, and Jiangxi has Yiyang Opera. Although the dialects of each province are different from each other, the operas can be connected. Roughly, they all use the official language as the correct one, but their rhythms are different, and the feeling is also different. This is why each forms its own tune.) In this way, in the history of the unified national language movement in modern China, opera has made the first contribution. A few years ago, someone advocated dramatic prose, and I also agreed with this view, because the dialogue in the drama and opera is self-contained, natural, lively, direct, and especially the ugly white, which is humorous and thought-provoking. Originally, our old opera can still support it until now, except for its tune, is that its dialogue can make the public understand and appreciate it. Especially the clown who interjects and hits the light, comes out to tell jokes and opens people's appetites. I think the truly old-fashioned domestic humorous vernacular is still to be selected from the old opera. In fact, the language and writing used in the old opera are originally for the masses, but the consciousness it represents is feudal consciousness. This is what people who advocate mass language literature should know.</p>
<p>In addition, such as Flower Drum, Tan Huang, Ballad, Treasure Scrolls, Songs, Proverbs, and other current small tunes, comic strips, small books and novels, etc., are all readings for the masses, or things for singing and speaking, which are worth collecting, sorting, researching, and criticizing. In short, if we want to build mass language literature, it is necessary to liquidate the things written in mass language in the past, as well as the current vernacular literature works and popular mass readings and songs in various places. We must absorb nutrients from many aspects that can help us survive and develop, so that a new life can grow and will not be short-lived. This is what people who are working hard to build mass language literature should pay attention to!</p>
<h3>Pain</h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>Pain is a regular customer of mine.</p>
<p>In the daytime, when human laughter of life resounds, I laugh, I talk eloquently, and I also engage in youthful and unrestrained fun with young companions. However, when night arrives with the stars, I fall into an abyss of pain, unable to extricate myself. A pair of painful pliers tightly grip my heart, and life emerges into the shadows.</p>
<p>In ignorant childhood, one does not recognize pain. Once life treads upon the stage of life, upon returning from a journey through the desert, history brings the gift of knowledge, and the dark side of humanity crushes my heart like a giant stone.</p>
<p>In "Crime and Punishment" and "Destruction," I see two aspects of pain, and in other books, I constantly shake hands with pain. Dostoevsky's haggard face appears before my eyes, and when meeting Mr. Ba Jin, I also see through the heart that holds immense pain. The profound pain of the protagonist of "Crime and Punishment" deeply pierces my heart, and the destruction of Duda Xin also makes people shed tears and feel melancholy.</p>
<p>It seems that Tolstoy's escape in old age was inevitable, and Maupassant's mad demise was also bound to happen.</p>
<p>Thus, at the tender age of seventeen, I began to weep for the grayness of life, and a burst of bright destruction pierced my heart with steel needles. In the mysterious black nights of the equator, I was often awakened by the howls of tropical wild dogs; and in the gloomy homeland, insomnia at night also made me deeply taste the flavor of pain. Biting my arm until it bled, I seemed to feel a burst of painful joy; in a society where people eat people, besides biting one's lip in humiliation, there is no other way to dismiss this moment of profound pain for the oppressed.</p>
<p>However, I also read "The Iron Flood," and Guo Ruhe's tightly clenched teeth, preparing to break through a bloody path, deeply moved me. This kind of power enabled me to realize the shamefulness of past tears, and pain has since taken on another aspect.</p>
<p>Also quietly clenching my teeth, enduring the suffering that history and fate have given me; under the twinkling stars in the night, I lie sleepless in bed, gazing at the bright future. This is the current form of my pain.</p>
<p>Believing that: after passing through profound pain, struggling on the path of life, light will always follow darkness.</p>
<h3>Self-Dismissal</h3>
<p>— Hu Jinxu</p>
<p>Spring worries about the withering of flowers, autumn worries about the waning of the bright moon. Destitute poet, life is but a bubble, do not imitate blind moths flying towards the red flame. Leisure is the supreme happiness, let the flowers be garbage, and the bright moon be a lump of mud.</p>
<h3>Moving</h3>
<p>— Shi Ye</p>
<p>In a few days, I will be moving, moving away from Dunhe Lane, where I have lived for one year and three months.</p>
<p>Moving is a very common thing, and it doesn't seem worth writing a few lines about, but for me, there are some emotions and some sadness.</p>
<p>I moved here last May. At that time, my ex-wife Ziying was still alive, but she was already very ill, and she was a person who would gasp for breath just by walking into an alley. When she moved into this Dunhe Lane, she said it wasn't good, blaming me for finding the wrong house, and I had nothing to say at the time. She never said the real reason why it wasn't good. More than a month later, she returned to her hometown surrounded by the sea, and eventually died there.</p>
<p>Ziying's illness was due to the January 28th Incident. We originally lived on Yokohama Road, and when the war started, it was right in the line of fire, so we had to find a way to escape. However, unfortunately, her younger brother, who lived in our house, was lost in the war zone because he was young and ignorant and somewhat daring. She was worried about him day and night and eventually developed an incurable disease. When the war was about to end, we had no place to live, so we had to return to our old home in Hankou. When she came to Shanghai again in September of the year before last, she was so thin that she was nothing but skin and bones. Who knew that her younger brother had safely escaped from danger before the war ended, but she, on the contrary, sacrificed herself because of him.</p>
<p>Now, as I am about to leave this place, I think of these things.</p>
<p>It is said that moving once is like taking a bath or getting a haircut, which can make people feel refreshed. If that's really the case, it's a happy thing, but it reminds me of another thing.</p>
<p>It was seven years ago when I was still in college. The winter vacation had started, and the students had returned to their hometowns one after another, but because my family's money hadn't arrived, I couldn't even pay the school servant's wine money, so I had to stay at school. My roommate Sicun was in the same situation as me. Finally, one cold winter morning, the two of us explained the reason to the school servant, and each of us carried a bag of luggage on our shoulders, dragging the short shadows of the winter sun, and moved to the "Green House" half a mile outside the school. At that time, walking on the frozen road, the two of us walked one after the other, and looking at the withered yellow fields, it did indeed cause some desolation. - This was also moving.</p>
<p>After moving to the "Green House," the two of us simultaneously declared a "new life," but I don't know how, we became even more decadent than before. We lived there for half a year and finally moved out like we were running away.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the year before last when I returned to Shanghai, I dragged some things from a friend that had survived the disaster, preparing to rebuild a home, and I felt somewhat different. - This was another move.</p>
<p>Life seems to be slowly consumed in this moving back and forth. Moving seems to be a trivial matter, but for the individuals involved, it is often a change of scene. In other words, that scene is over, and when the next scene opens, it will be another situation.</p>
<h3>Tea Dispensing</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Old Man (4)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>As he sucked in the air forcefully, the musty smell stimulated his nose, causing him to sneeze loudly, and tears streamed down his face. He called out to his grandson and helped him to a chair to sit down.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, allowing his spirit to rest a little, but if at this time the voices of strangers buzzed in his ears, he would immediately jump up, rub his eyes, and follow the objects pointed to by the customer's fingers, beginning to talk eloquently about the stories of those objects that were firmly imprinted in his mind.</p>
<p>But he himself had lived to the age of seventy-four, and he was as old and worn as his goods, and there should be a string of wonderful and moving stories about him in other people's mouths. Or perhaps no one had a deep interest in him, because he was such an old man who made people feel bored, living alone and without flavor.</p>
<p>His grandson Sasha—his only helper—had also secretly left him two years ago. In the short note he left, there was this sentence: "My departure is because I am unwilling to bury my youth in this dilapidated atmosphere." This made the old man so angry that he could only tremble.</p>
<p>"A dilapidated atmosphere, a dilapidated atmosphere," his mouth murmured, "but you grew up in this dilapidated atmosphere! Wherever you go, God's eyes will always see you, bury you in the earth, bury you in the ocean!"</p>
<p>He cursed so fiercely.</p>
<p>From then on, he was alone. He had to get up and open the door himself in the morning, and he had to lock the door himself at night. The large glass in the window had not been wiped since the young lad left, and it was covered with a layer of fog-like dirt.</p>
<p>He often missed the young lad who had left him. Naturally, he really needed someone to help him. Besides this reason, there was also a bit of affection that could not be expressed in words that made him unable to forget.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he took an old coat and added a lot of nice words, and exchanged it for a bottle of vodka and two pieces of roasted veal. Gasping for breath, he sat down in his armchair; at that time, he suddenly thought of his grandson drifting in an unknown place. He thought that if Sasha were here, it would be more interesting. He remembered Sasha's singing and dancing (he used to feel that Sasha's singing made his head dizzy and his dancing made his brain swell), and he wondered if he could also drink to his heart's content all night long on this New Year's Day?</p>

<h3>Xia Lanzheng Wins Championship</h3>
<p>Two Sets of 6-2 Victory Over Bao Dajing Yesterday. Chen Rongming and Wang Shikun Win Doubles. The All-Shanghai Women's Open Tennis Tournament, organized by the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Association, concluded yesterday with a final performance. The lingering charm is indeed worthy of recollection. The details of the matches are briefly recorded below: Doubles: The doubles match started at 8 AM. Su Wu won the first game, and Chen Wang immediately reciprocated. After that, the situation was very balanced, with neither side gaining a significant advantage. When the score reached 3-3, Chen Wang suddenly launched a fierce attack, winning three consecutive games to take the first set. At the start of the second set, Su Wu was unable to gain momentum after winning the first game. Chen Wang took the lead all the way, and ended the match with a score of 6-2, completing a situation of four wins out of four matches, and winning the championship. Singles: The singles match started at 4 PM. No fewer than a hundred people came to watch, and the usually deserted Liangjiang court was bustling with activity. Photography reporters first took a group photo of all the participants, and the Linhua Company also came to the court to film. At 4:15, the referee Zhang Yuansheng announced the start of the match. Xia served and won three consecutive games, and Bao started to be careful and won back two games. The audience fully expected Bao to catch up all the way from then on, but unexpectedly, after the fourth game, the situation went straight down, and she lost three consecutive games, ending the first set. At the start of the second set, Xia continued to attack with the remaining power of her victory, while Bao was downcast and listless, barely coping, resulting in another loss of 6-2, and the championship went to Ms. Xia. After the match, Liangjiang Principal Lu Lihua specially prepared refreshments to entertain foreign guests and participating players, and the host and guests dispersed happily at 6 PM. It is said that the association will hold the tournament every season, making it a permanent competition. | - Six to Two - | Xia Lanzheng - | | - Bao Dajing | - Six to Two - | Chen Rongming | - Six to Three - | Wu Sufen | | Wang Shikun | - Six to Two - | Su Tingcao</p>

<h3>Grand Closing Ceremony and Awards</h3>
<p>Men's and Women's Champions Discuss History. Hebei and Qingdao Congratulate Each Other. He Wenjin Hopes to Surpass Yang Xiuqiong. (Special Dispatch from Beiping) The North China Games Swimming Competition was held in Beiping, lasting only one day. It opened yesterday (the 11th) and closed (the 12th), with Mrs. He Yingqin, Wang Wenxiang, personally presenting the awards on the spot. The details are as follows: Women's Overall Champion Speaks. The reporter interviewed Ms. He Wenjin, the overall champion of the women's group, by the pool. According to her, she is 13 years old, from Dongguan, Guangdong, and a junior high school student at Qingdao Sacred Heart Girls' High School. She has been practicing swimming for three years. She is usually too busy with her studies to practice, but she often performs during summer vacation. Although she won the overall championship this time, she still needs to work hard. There are few women in our country who are trained in swimming. I hope that at the very least, I will surpass Miss Yang (Xiuqiong). I once broke the North China record in the 200-meter breaststroke. The existing North China record at that time was set by Shi Ruisheng. Men's Overall Champion Speaks. The reporter also interviewed Mr. Dong Jingchun, the overall champion of the men's group, next to the podium. According to him, he is 22 years old, from Fengrun, Hebei, and a second-year high school student at Tianjin Nankai Middle School. He started swimming in the countryside at the age of ten. After entering school, he first practiced swimming in Dalian for three years, and then in Tianjin for four years. He has been formally practicing swimming for seven years in total. When I first started practicing swimming in Dalian, I saw that Japanese children could all swim. I deeply lamented the physical weakness of our country's children, so I invited classmates to swim together. Soon, my interest grew, and I made swimming my only physical expression. In Tianjin, although there were no good facilities, in order to unite, I invited Nankai Middle School students to organize the Haiou Swimming Team, with 15 members. Six of them participated in the North China Swimming Competition this time. At first, I was afraid of dying, but then I rescued people myself, and I was no longer afraid of dying. I also deeply realized that water sports are more interesting than land sports. Record Breakers Speak. The reporter interviewed Ms. He Wenzhi, who broke the North China record. According to her, she is 15 years old, from Dongguan, Guangdong, and a senior high school student at Qingdao Sacred Heart Girls' High School. She has been practicing swimming for three years. Before practicing swimming, she was very weak. After practicing swimming for half a year, her appetite increased and her physical strength became stronger. She has not been ill for three years. Although I am nearsighted, it does not hinder me from practicing swimming. I broke the North China record in the Qingdao swimming competition last year. This time, I only broke the North China record in the North China Swimming Competition. I hope to break the Far East record first in the future, and then break the world record. It is not for winning the championship, but to promote swimming. Grand Award Ceremony. The awards were presented at 1 PM. Athletes from nine units including Qingdao, Hebei, Beiping, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Harbin, Rehe, and Shandong stood around the podium, and Mrs. He Yingqin, Wang Wenxiang, the wife of the Minister of Military Affairs, presented the awards in the following order: (1) Women's Overall Champion, (2) Men's Overall Champion, (3) Team Overall Champion, (4) Awarding medals to all winners. When each athlete received the award, the whole audience applauded. The award ceremony ended at 1:20 PM. Closing Ceremony. President Yuan Liang was unable to attend due to business, so Cai Yuan, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered the closing speech, stating that the North China Swimming Competition was held in Ping, and the athletes from each province and city achieved excellent results. However, Beiping had few opportunities to practice, and this swimming pool was only established last year. Although the interest was high, the results were average. This time, I have two thoughts: (1) You have come to Ping to perform swimming, but the facilities are poor. I represent Beiping and express my apologies. (2) Beiping prepared in a hurry and could not provide adequate hospitality. Please forgive me. However, the citizens of Beiping were excited by this swimming opportunity. I hope that the next swimming competition will still be held in Beiping. I think that the swimming results of each province and city will be even better at that time. Then, Ma Yuehan, a member of the organizing committee, gave a speech expressing his gratitude. The closing ceremony ended at 1:50 PM. Bits and Pieces at the Venue. (1) After Ms. He Wenjin of Qingdao won the overall championship of the women's group, she did not know her score and told the male athletes that she could not win the championship. When the reporter interviewed her, Ms. He learned the news from the reporter's mouth. (2) Ms. Ruan Guanyu, the beauty of the Chinese Academy, arrived at the venue at 9 AM today (12th) in gorgeous clothes, and her actions attracted the attention of those who knew her. (3) Ms. Wang Jingzhi, a member of the competition committee, had a delicate face and sweated profusely while directing the female athletes in the hot sun, and was highly regarded. (4) When the awards were presented, the athletes from Qingdao applauded for the athletes from Hebei, and the athletes from Hebei applauded for the athletes from Qingdao, seemingly complimenting each other. American Swimmers in Japan</p>
<h3>Set New World Record</h3>
<p>Van den Hooff Sets 200m Backstroke Record with 2:33.2 (Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th) The final day of the All-Japan Aquatic Championships was held at the Jingu Pool from 6 PM last night. The three American athletes who came to Japan achieved excellent results on this day, winning the 400m freestyle and 200m backstroke championships. Their results are as follows: 400m Freestyle Final: 1st: Medica (US) 4:47.8, 2nd: Makino 4:49, 3rd: Negami 4:49.2. 100m Freestyle Final: 1st: Yusa 59 seconds, 2nd: Highland (US) 59+ seconds, 3rd: Sakagami 59.8 seconds. 200m Backstroke Final: - Long Course World Record - 1st: Van den Hooff (US) 2:33.2 | - Japanese International New Record - 2nd: Yoshida 2:37.2, 3rd: Kawazu 2:41.2. 200m Breaststroke Final: 1st: Koike 2:45, 2nd: Haga 3rd: Nakagawa. 800m Relay Final: 1st: Inyo Kai 9:15 (Nagami, Shimura, Sakagami, Makino), 2nd: Meiji University 9:20 (Katayama, Ishihara, Takemura, Oyokota), 3rd: Kyoto Bu Sōkai (Japan League Press, Tokyo, 14th) American swimmer Bandeau set a new world record of 2:33.2 in the 200m backstroke here on the evening of the 13th. The current world record is 2:32.2 set by American swimmer Kojo, but this record was set in a 25-meter swimming pool, so Bandeau's performance is better than Kojo's.</p>

<h3>Stipulates School Forms</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 14th) The Ministry of Education has stipulated the content and format of various forms to be submitted by schools above the junior college level, and issued a notice to the education bureaus and departments of each province and city and the national junior colleges and above on the 14th to comply with. Secondary Education</p>
<h3>Recent Reforms (Continued)</h3>
<p>(B) The Problem of Dividing Subjects in Secondary Schools into Arts and Sciences: In Hebei Province, some high schools divide their curriculum into arts and sciences. However, the recent high school graduation examination did not differentiate between the subjects, requiring arts students to take physics and chemistry, and science students to take history and geography. This resulted in one-third of the students failing. Consequently, some people advocate for a return to subject-specific examinations. It is noted that senior high schools (formerly general studies programs) are not allowed to divide into arts and science streams. This system has been in place for many years. Previously, a few provinces and cities reported to the Ministry that some high schools' general studies programs were dividing into arts and science streams. The Ministry immediately issued orders to correct this.</p>
<p>(C) The Relationship Between the Graduation Examination and University Admission: There is considerable criticism from various parties regarding the inability of students who pass the high school graduation examination to gain direct admission to universities. This view has merit. Allowing graduation examination passers to be exempt from entrance examinations has precedents in countries like France. However, Chinese secondary and higher education are currently only in the initial stages of reform. Using the graduation examination to replace university entrance examinations cannot be achieved in one step, even if the system itself were perfect. This is because too many general high schools are poorly managed. The passing standard for the graduation examination can only be gradually raised. In this initial phase, it is necessary to establish realistic regulations (currently, those who fail one or two subjects can still take the university entrance examination but must retake the failed subjects). Therefore, some graduation examination passers, based on their aptitude or educational foundation, may still be unable to pursue advanced studies. Allowing them all into universities, even if national universities had the capacity, might not benefit them individually or society. Therefore, children with low aptitude or impoverished backgrounds should not enter general high schools but should instead go to senior or junior vocational schools. However, achieving this goal requires the establishment of excellent vocational schools as mentioned in the previous section, and limiting the expansion of general high schools. This also requires serious effort over two to three years to be effective. Moreover, many specialized schools and above currently lack standard teachers and equipment, and very few are well-managed. The recruitment of high school graduates is mostly concentrated in a small number of schools. No matter how much these few schools expand their capacity, they cannot accommodate all applicants. Therefore, as a remedy, efforts should be made to rigorously supervise all specialized schools, encouraging them to improve across the board. The government should provide financial assistance to those with a slightly better foundation (the central government's recent establishment of subsidies for private specialized schools and above is for this purpose). Only in this way can it be hoped that, in a few years, high school graduates will have access to comparatively well-managed schools to attend.</p>
<h3>(D) The Relationship Between Student Performance and School Efficiency</h3>
<p>The graduation examination system was originally designed to raise the standard of secondary schools and assess the efficiency of school management. Some argue that student performance and school efficiency should not be confused. Poor student performance may be due to the student's natural aptitude and should not be attributed to low school efficiency. In reality, students' aptitudes do vary. Some have such poor aptitude that they are beyond help, and the school's best efforts yield little effect. It is often said that the best students in mediocre schools are more capable than the average students in excellent schools, and the worst students in the latter are far inferior to the average students in the former. This is clear evidence. However, extremely high or low aptitude is limited to a few students. In a school with hundreds of students, there may be a few whose aptitude prevents them from passing, despite the school's efforts. However, the ability of most students to pass depends entirely on the level of school efficiency. Most students are of average ability (the so-called "norm"). Their aptitude is neither exceptional nor poor, and they are naturally influenced by the school's efforts. In summary, although our country's current secondary education has various weaknesses that are dissatisfying to us, if the people of the country continue to pay attention, engage in continuous and detailed discussions, and the central and local governments persistently implement reform plans, we dare to believe that in two to three years, the face of secondary education in the country will be transformed. It may well be a major contribution to the future of the national rejuvenation movement. (End)</p>

The customs wharf was so crowded that there was hardly any space. Cheers and firecrackers were continuous, and the scene was more enthusiastic than in previous years. The Hoover set sail from the Dalai Wharf in Yangshupu at 10:30 AM yesterday morning. The students all boarded small ferries at the Customs Wharf at 9:00 AM to get to the large steamer.

<h3>Wang Jiliang Going Abroad for Research</h3>
<p>Wang Jiliang, Director of the Chemistry Institute of the National Central Research Institute, who has served as a professor of chemistry at the National Southeast University and Zhejiang University, chairman of the Chemistry Department and Dean of the College of Science at the Central University, and president of the China Science Society for many years, has made numerous contributions to scientific education in China. In the spring of 1929, he took over the Chemistry Institute of the Central Research Institute. At that time, because the institute was in its early stages, everything needed to be started from scratch. Wang painstakingly managed the institute, and its scale gradually took shape. Last autumn, it moved into the new building of the Science and Engineering Experiment Hall on Bailinan Road, and various research equipment could be arranged in order, making it quite impressive. The planned research projects were then able to concentrate their efforts and implement them step by step. His research on the manufacture of chemical glassware has progressed to a considerable extent. This initiative is of great importance to the future of chemical research and education in our country, and it is especially gratifying. Now that Wang's work at the institute has a considerable foundation, he wishes to take the opportunity to go abroad for research to learn from others. He has received permission from President Cai of the institute, who will provide funding for him to go to Europe and the United States to study chemical research and related industries, in order to fulfill his long-cherished wish. He has also received a subsidy from the China Cultural Foundation, allowing him to conduct long-term research and study abroad. In the future, he will surely make even greater contributions to domestic scientific education and research. Wang boarded the Dalai Company's Hoover ship on the 14th. His position as director has been temporarily taken over by Zhuang Changgong, it is said. Secondary schools in the city</p>

<p>Financial swap approaching, demand exceeds supply</p>
<h3>Gold Standard Falls Seven Yuan</h3>
<p>▲Silver Rise Fails to Satisfy▲</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market rose due to the weak silver price increase and swap deals. There were many ups and downs in the process. In the morning, overseas calls indicated that the London market had only slightly increased, exchange rates had contracted, London raw gold had risen by one and a half pennies, American cotton had risen by five pounds, and American wheat had fluctuated slightly. Stock prices had risen by two yuan. Reports cited American banker Thomas claiming that he advocated immediately raising the gold price to $41.43 per ounce and broadly using silver. However, people remained calm. Reuters reported that the US President sent a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury on June 14, ordering him to issue silver certificates for 62 million ounces of silver at a price of $1.29. This news was outdated and had no impact. The spot price of goods opened and rose to over fifty yuan. After private telegraph exchange rates were reported higher, they slightly declined. After the opening, bank sales were strong, but due to swap deals, the demand for gold exceeded supply, resulting in an increase. Although the domestic market was loose, it struggled around the fifty yuan mark, but HSBC also made efforts to stabilize the trend. There were still some dealers in the middle, and when the domestic market tightened, the gold price rose firmly. Later, Chase suddenly agreed to supply US dollars for October at 35.5 yuan and 5625 pairs, and the Guangdong banks made great efforts to supply, causing the price to fall, but it was still able to recover slightly after the decline. After some fluctuations, the afternoon session closed lower. Later, due to rumors of conflict between Japanese and French soldiers in Shanhaiguan, the market immediately retreated to within the fifty yuan mark, and the trend was weak. Ultimately, due to swap deals, the low price was strongly maintained, and it gradually rose to over fifty yuan again. A private telegraph from the American Feng Bank stated that Chinese silver sold to the United States would now be calculated at a price of 49.95 cents and stored in Shanghai without being shipped to New York. For a time, opinions were divided. Although it rose, it was still fluctuating. It was rumored that a certain bank was preparing to ship out a huge amount of silver, but it also received a telegram from New York to stop exporting, which suddenly boosted confidence. A telegram from Mumbai reported a drop of 6.5.5 annas, making the gold price even more attractive. In the end, the bank was still willing to supply, and Mumbai rebounded by 2.1.1 annas. It retreated after rising, but the market situation at closing was very stable. The red gold price was 963.7 yuan. The day's market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 948.2 yuan, up 2 yuan from the previous close. The opening for goods was 8.5 yuan. The morning opening price for the foreign exchange market was 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 625 for the near-term selling price of British exchange, and 35.375 yuan for American exchange.

Yuanheng, Dadecheng, and others sold again, and Zhengjin McGarry came out with US dollars for September at half a yuan, dropping to 50 yuan. After entering, the domestic market suddenly tightened, and the gold market became attractive. Tongtaichang, Yuanchangyong, and Li purchased non-stop. Dafa, Yongshunmao, Shunli, Dekang, Zhaofengchang, and others also jointly purchased. US dollars for September at 4375 were no longer available for sale, and rose to 2.5 yuan. Although Shengda and Dadecheng Huixiang sold within 2 yuan, confidence was still strong at this time, and they were still able to struggle around 2 yuan. Later, Datong agreed to sell US dollars for October at half a yuan and 5625 pairs. The foreign exchange market showed signs of hardening. Guangdong banks and Shengda sold heavily, and a selling trend began again, falling to 0.6 jiao. Yuanchun, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Zhaofengchang, and others slightly restocked, and rose back to 1.8 jiao. Yuanxing, Daxing, Yongdingchang, and others sold off one after another. The afternoon close fell to 950.2 yuan, and the spot price of goods was 1 yuan. The post-market closed higher.</p>
<p>In the post-market, due to news of a conflict between Japanese and French soldiers in Yuguan, the opening immediately retreated to 949.6 yuan. The spot price of goods opened at 9.7 yuan (the off-market was still flat). Yicheng, Fuan, Dadecheng, and Hengtai all sold, and dropped from 9.8 yuan to 8.8 yuan. Citibank and Zhengjin came out with US dollars for October at 625. Yuqing, Yongda, Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, and others advanced, rising to 9.7 yuan. Confidence was still timid. After Jingda, Dadecheng, Hongkang, Yongfuyu, and Hengxing sold, they immediately retreated to 8.5 yuan. Tianfeng, Zhengchang, Dalian banks, Qianchangxiang, and Dadecheng jointly bought in, gradually rising to over 52 yuan. Yuanmaoyong sold off vigorously and was still struggling. When Mumbai reported a small decrease of 6 annas, a buying spree suddenly arose. Fuyu, Dafa, Yongqingyu, and others all advanced, rising to 4 yuan. Mumbai rose again by 2 annas. The bank's appetite was still strong. After Yuqingyong, Tianfeng Yifengyong sold off, they retreated to 2.3 yuan. Zhengchang and others had a strong desire to buy, and the market situation was stable. The closing price was 953.2 yuan, and the spot price of goods was 3 yuan. The post-market closed flat. The highest price of the day was 954 yuan, and the lowest price was 948.2 yuan, a difference of 5.8 yuan. As a result, it closed 7 yuan higher than the previous close.</p>
<p>Settlement price: because HSBC Bank's US dollar listing price did not move, it was still 35.125 yuan, and the combined gold price was 985 yuan. According to the closing price, the discount was about less than 32 yuan, which was 7 yuan less than the previous close. The registered price for this month was 954 yuan, and 950 yuan for September. The water supplement in the morning was 954 yuan, and the water supplement in the afternoon was 957 yuan. The red gold price was 963.7 yuan, about 15.5 yuan higher. There was a slight profit in the end. The Tianjin banks in the market came to replenish their positions. The transaction price was from 19 yuan to 20 yuan higher. Approximately over 2,000 taels were supplied by spot firms such as Yingfeng, Hengtai, Kangrun, Dadecheng, Tongfeng, Hengda, and Fenghheng. The swap premium also rose, with Hengyu paying Qianchangxiang 77 bars at 7.1 yuan. There were some account transfers for this month's bars. The expected swap premium for this session is 6 yuan, and the situation is very difficult to predict. It all depends on whether the bulls unite. The public orders cleared on the day were 140 bars for Yingfengheng, 56 bars for Dadecheng, and 7 bars for Dafengheng. The orders received were 105 bars for Fuchang, 56 bars for Wanxing, and 42 bars for Shunli. There were 1,400 bars left for August.

<p>Northern Banks Covering Shorts Initially Showed Improvement</p>
<h3>Bond Sellers Still Active</h3>
<p>－Overall, Still Not Breaking Free from Sideways Movement－</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange initially seemed to show signs of improvement, with Northern banks covering shorts. However, confidence was not strong, and selling continued to surge. No. 4 and No. 5 bonds were both being sold off, so stability could not be established. The trading floor was loose, and confidence could not be boosted. Prices would rise slightly and then fall back. Sellers still had a lot of strength. Although the environment was unchanged, the chips were still loose and overflowing. The current trend is, in general, still within a range-bound pattern. Yesterday's process: at the opening, Northern banks immediately began to cover shorts, and market prices slowly rose, showing signs of recovery. Prices rose by about 1 jiao to 4 jiao. After entering, No. 4 bonds saw a lot of selling off, around 22 barriers, and turned sluggish and lifeless again. The rising trend, which had just begun, was thwarted again. The second round immediately saw a uniform pullback of 5 fen to 1 jiao to 3 jiao. With this repeated failure to recover firmly, the pattern may start small and then become large. The future situation is chaotic and not easy to deal with. The market price results mostly rose by 1 or 2 jiao to 4.5 jiao. After the 22 barrier, most saw only a slight increase of 1 or 2 jiao. The total transaction volume was 8,012,000 yuan. The changes in prices are listed below for comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Advances</h3>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported yesterday (13th) that the New York stock market, led by railroad stocks, made progress. This was due to the fact that railroad stocks had been oversold recently and a natural rebound occurred. The wave of inflation is still rampant, so stocks that benefit from the devaluation of the US dollar, such as fine factories, canned goods, and food stocks, are in high demand. The government's housing construction plan caused construction materials stocks to rise. Although steel output decreased last week, steel stocks were still good. Silver stocks were still strong. American Telephone and Telegraph was quite strong, as it is hoped that the dividend will be issued as usual at the board meeting on Wednesday. The small exchange also rose slightly, led by petroleum and food stocks. The bond market initially saw a selling spree, but later, due to US government bonds and speculative industrial bonds rising with stocks, the full-day transaction volume was 810,000. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>|  | 11th | 13th | Change |</p>

After the opening prices, with factories holding back and sellers scarce, the market was 3-4 points better than the previous day. Some Tianjin syndicates were buying in all months, leading to improved sentiment. Current spot flour quotations there are shouting at 2.86 Yuan, close to recent standard prices in this port. By the afternoon opening, sentiment in all markets seemed to have stabilized. There was little movement in or out, and trading was not very active. It is heard that the Tianjin syndicate is still able to absorb spot flour. At the current market price, it can hold steady for the time being.

New 砶 and new 糙, etc., are all handled by inland syndicates. Additionally, another batch of Zhangzhou rice arrived. Some suspect this rice is Taiwanese, but according to industry insiders, Taiwanese rice is mostly old and whole-grain, as it is warehouse stock.

<h3>Reasons for Unstable Rise and Fall of White Tung Oil</h3>
<p>Hankou Market is Entirely Controlled by Foreign Firms, Oil Merchants Have Lost Their Dominant Position</p>
<p>White tung oil sometimes rises and sometimes falls, extremely capable of doing the most. Because the Hankou market is already controlled by foreign firms, all oil firms must rely on them. Therefore, the rise and fall of foreign firms' prices, as well as the opening of customer goods, cannot but observe the foreign firms' situation. Oil firms have lost their position, too much invested, gradually came. And each foreign firm is still setting up firms in each production area to purchase, so even though Hankou Market is historically a centralized market, it is only partial at present. At a time when domestic sales are not strong, entirely relying on transactions by foreign firms, to embellish the market, then foreign firms can be more able to control the market situation. Because the internal situation has been deeply known by the opposing party, and between capture and release, it is easier. Throughout the market price rising to over 30 Yuan, each foreign firm must cease and stop doing it, until it falls to 28 Yuan, transactions by foreign firms are seen again. Having gone through this before, accurately, the processes of recent months, farmers cannot be exceptions, all those in this business, can be able to deduce this, in the previous week Hankou Market sales by foreign firms has already fallen to 28.4 Yuan, then because foreign transactions turned prosperous, it continued to increase and rise, adding to 30 Yuan a little bit, and recently it is quiet again, according to the Hankou news of the past two days, it has already become a little loose, sales opened at 29.8 Yuan, I am afraid the foreign transactions are not strong, falling again a few, should be expected, if it falls to a little outside 28 Yuan, then the situation is about to turn lively again, Zhejiang tung oil also follows this advance and retreat, so each picul market price is also between 26-27 Yuan, turning and circling. But it is heard that the stock in each production area of Sichuan, Hunan and Hubei is already thin, or for this reason a special change occurs, it is not yet known.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Autumn Silkworms in Zhejiang Province Begin to Move</h3>
<p>▲Silkworm Eggs Engaged in Acid Immersion. Zhejiang Province's Silkworm Season Starts Earlier than Jiangsu Province. After the Start of Autumn, Autumn Silkworms in Hangzhou and Shaoxing Start One After Another. The Zhejiang Construction Department Plans to Issue 600,000 Sheets of Eggs This Year. Currently, the Designated Numbers are: Hangzhou County, Jiaxing, Haiyan, 50,000 Sheets Each; Haining, Deqing, 40,000 Sheets Each; Changxing 15,000 Sheets; Yuhang 4,000 Sheets.

<p>▲Italy's Intention to Sell Waste Silk is Gradually Rising. Italy Has Had an Excess of Raw Silk in Recent Years. Our Country's Italy Sales of Waste Silk Have Been Stagnant for a Long Time. It Has Recently Shown Signs of Activity. The Italian Postal Ship "Conte Verde" Sailed from Shanghai. Baoke and Other Firms in This Port Have a Total of 203 Pieces of Yellow and White Waste Silk Loaded to Milan and Other Ports.</p>
<p>▲Foreign Firms' Silk Sales are Difficult to Be Smooth. The New York Raw Silk Market Has Continued to Rise in Both 期貨 and Spot Prices Since the Beginning of the Week. Various European and American Firms in Shanghai Have Purchasing Intentions for Factory-Managed 期貨 and Spot Goods. However, the Exchange Rate is Trending Tense Again, and the Price Difference Still Greatly Differs from the Costs of Various Manufacturers. Therefore, They are All Watching and Not Selling. Only Xinfu and Others Imported 30 Bales of Yellow and White Factory-Managed Goods Yesterday. Prices are Difficult to Rise.</p>

<p>Chronicle</p>
<h3>Record of Floating Fragrance</h3>
<p>—Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After four or five minutes, the clever Empress Dowager immediately came up with a way to salvage the situation. So she personally directed the eunuchs on how to reassemble all the wooden frames, how to tie them up with colored threads, so that every antique or jade could be as secure as Mount Tai. By the time our train was slowly advancing towards Tianjin at a speed like a cow's pace, everything had been completely prepared. But we had forgotten one thing after all, which was the four vases on the corners of the small court. Because the wooden frames under them were made of rosewood, and were very smooth, and the bottom of the vases were also very smooth, so the four vases, affected by the movement of the train, moved freely like they had legs; sliding out little by little, and eventually two of them hung down. When the eunuchs saw this, they rushed over, hurriedly holding up the two that had not hung down first. Fortunately, the two that had already hung down were not broken either, because the velvet carpet underneath was really too thick. However, although I was fortunate that the vases were not broken at the time, later, when I thought about it, I was afraid that the dirty water in the vases would stain this valuable velvet carpet. I rushed over to take a look, and fortunately it had not been stained, because the water in the vases was originally very little.</p>
<p>Although the vases and carpet were fortunate to be unharmed, the scare we had was not small. So everyone hurriedly re-examined and tied everything next to them, hoping to be able to be done once and for all, and avoid being frightened in the same way again.</p>
<p>Thus, our long journey officially began. But the author's blunt pen could not set off with the train, because in the above text, although I have described all the passengers on this imperial train, - from the Empress Dowager to the cooks and servants - I have omitted a very important person. In terms of his status, he was simply second only to the Empress Dowager, and compared to him, we were really overshadowed. So. Who is he? It turned out to be the Empress Dowager's beloved dog, it also had a name, a very mighty name, called (Hailong); in fact, no one had ever seen what kind of animal Hailong was (105).</p>
<h3>Military Song</h3>
<p>—Rong Yu</p>
<p>More than thirty years ago, when I was only seven or eight years old, I still had a small braid tied with a red thread on my head. Every time I got out of night school, I would gather a few little friends, carry wooden sticks and short rods, and play the game of military exercises, singing such a military song in my mouth:</p>
<p>Advance! Advance! Advance, advance, advance! Who says the yellow people are still in a big dream? Die without retreating, a good and strong man. For the country, for the family, for all my people.</p>
<p>This song is majestic and steady, and singing it really inspires people's minds. There is also a song that is more激昂 and louder than the previous one, but unfortunately, the second half has been forgotten! I will record what I remember below:</p>
<p>The world's heroes, men fight for merit; the world's joy, heroes break the enemy's country. From ancient times to the present, prosperity and destruction are impermanent, you see him, strongly swallowing the weak. …</p>
<p>Speaking of the popularity of these two military songs among the people; children's mouths were full of them, but there was also a small segment of grabbing Mulberry. It turned out that at this time, just after the defeat of the Sino-Japanese War, the imperial court sent Wang Ministers to study the new policies overseas, thinking about reforms to become stronger, in addition to promulgating constitutional government; it also promoted the conscription system, and many young people from all over the country voluntarily enlisted. They wore Western-style exercise clothes, coiled their braids on the top of their heads, and wore military caps, which were really majestic. Compared to the original Green Battalion soldiers, who wrapped black cloth on their heads, wore feather yarn Yong characters battle jackets, and wore black cloth fast boots, they felt a new look. These two military songs were sung by these new soldiers back then, and we children were very fond of imitation, so naturally we learned them quickly. However, the lives of those conscripts were very short, because they looked down on the corruption of the Green Battalion soldiers; and the Green Battalion soldiers could not stand their airs. When stationed in the same place, they often had fights over trivial matters. The imperial court at that time was ultimately unhappy with the new style, so it disbanded them, and these two military songs are still deeply engraved in our minds.</p>
<h3>Incompatible Life</h3>
<p>—Yan</p>
<p>Ah Ju works in a yarn factory, wearing silk and satin all year round, silk stockings and leather shoes, as beautiful as a little girl from a good family. But although she is so particular about clothes, she is very simple in terms of food and housing. Whether she eats rice or porridge, she always has two pieces of dried radish or a pack of fried soybeans, and she never buys any good dishes to eat with her meals. She lives in the kitchen, with a broken bed and quilt, which is simply like a hospital.</p>
<p>Mr. Li is a teacher in a school in the alley, with a monthly income of sixteen gold. Ah Song works in a car company, with a monthly income of twenty gold. Although their income is small, they dress in foreign clothes and wear leather shoes, looking like a petty bourgeois. Speaking of their food and housing, that is also extremely ridiculous. Mr. Li implements the abolition of breakfast, eats lunch at school, and cooks his own meals when he comes back in the evening. He cooks a pot of rice and eats it for a few days, and fries a salted yellow fish and eats it for a few days. If he doesn't eat yellow fish, then two copper plates of tofu are also swallowed in one meal. Ah Song doesn't know how to cook, so he goes to a small restaurant for every meal, and tofu soup and soybean soup are his most economical side dishes. Both of them live with friends in the attic, and the simplicity and filth in the room is simply frightening to enter. In short, with their beautiful and clean bodies, no one would expect that their food and housing would be so careless.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu is pot-bellied, lives in a foreign house, goes in and out by car, eats foreign food, and enjoys all the modern material civilization he needs. Everyone would expect such a new figure to have new ideas and do some new things, but he does not allow his children to go to school, and only hires an old scholar to teach them the Four Books and Five Classics at home; he also makes the decisions for his children's marriages. He personally likes monks and Taoists, and he is willing to donate a thousand or eight hundred where a temple is built, he is willing to donate a robe for a bodhisattva where a bodhisattva is sculpted, and he is willing to be the initiator or sponsor where a dharma assembly is held. As for disaster relief and national salvation, and all charitable undertakings in society, no one has the ability to say that he donates a penny. His incompatibility in life is really extreme.</p>
<h3>Puppy</h3>
<p>—Tian Zai</p>
<p>Not the vicious dog that "bites Lü Dongbin and does not know a good heart", nor the running dog that "wags its head and tail" begging for everything, nor the snobbish dog that "only values clothes and does not value people". Puppy is the name of a poor out-of-school child. Everyone will sympathize with and pity this honest and clever child.</p>
<p>He died when he was seven years old, and now only he and his kind mother are left. Life forced the helpless mother and son, so his mother worked as a helper, and Puppy worked as a small vendor to make a living.</p>
<p>The weather was hot at 104 degrees, and the sun shone directly on the earth, and people stayed at home complaining about the heat. Puppy, however, took fifteen copper coins as capital, carried a broken basket, and a iron stick, selling ice on the bright and slippery, hot and soft asphalt road, sweat running down and soaking his pants, shouting "Selling ice!" Is this little friend more bitter than many big friends?</p>
<p>These days, I don't know where he learned the words ("...He who receives it from Heaven, so virtuous is he. He who does not receive it from Heaven, then he is everyone. Now, he who does not receive it from Heaven is indeed everyone, and he who does not receive it from man, can he only be everyone?"). He sold the ice and muttered to himself, repeating it. Although he himself did not understand its meaning, it reminded me of Wang Anshi's "Injury to Zhongyong", and I couldn't help but secretly feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>("Puppy, the ice-selling Puppy.") This impression is often engraved in my mind.</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of the God of Peace</h3>
<h3>Monkey Show</h3>
<p>—Liu Sha</p>
<p>Under the scorching sun, the gongs and drums were beaten. The naughty children with blisters all over their heads and faces, like a wisp of smoke, and like a splash of water, all ran towards the place where the gongs were beaten. Although the children were young, they had quite a bit of experience with this kind of gong sound. Their childish hearts already knew that this must be for something good to see.</p>
<p>The children formed a wall around the place where the gongs were beaten. Inside the wall, the Shandong man, with his back bare, led out a small monkey. The monkey rolled its eyes, and the children laughed loudly.</p>
<p>The Shandong man led the monkey and shouted, "Small trick, how many sets to play?" One set, two sets, that's how it's going to be. The monkey rolled its eyes, wearing a ghost mask, wearing a flowered shirt, jumped, climbed, and then the children went crazy and burst into loud laughter. The Shandong man's head was rolling with sweat, and he was still shouting enthusiastically, "Small trick, another set."</p>
<p>But this time, the monkey disobeyed the master's orders. It didn't jump or move, and sat on the ground as if it were about to die. The children looked at the monkey and didn't want it, and gradually felt a little disappointed. But the Shandong man understood this mentality very well and used it. He said, "The small trick needs copper coins. If there are no copper coins, it's no good." Then the Shandong man bowed to the surroundings, and taught the monkey to kowtow on the ground, "Only thirty copper coins are needed, with thirty, the small trick is willing to do it." But the customers around were either naked or wearing small cloth shirts, but there were no pockets on the cloth shirts. Some only had fire𤵭zi, and even if they had a copper coin, they had to buy candy to eat. There was no such large amount, and they were reluctant to give it to the monkey.</p>
<p>The Shandong man bowed as much as possible, and the little monkey kowtowed as much as possible, but they didn't get a copper piece from the customers. What money did the children originally have? The Shandong man took the monkey away with a look of frustration, and the children cursed in disappointment, "The Shandong man is extremely strange." But the Shandong man's suffering was incomprehensible to the children.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge</p>
<h3>Secrets to Using an Ice Box</h3>
<p>—Bing Yu</p>
<p>Ice boxes are essential for middle-class and above families in summer. There are three types: gas ice boxes, electric ice boxes, and ice-placement ice boxes. Gas and electric ice boxes are beyond the reach of the middle class, except for the propertied class. The cooling device of a gas ice box first heats ammonia water with gas, turning it into ammonia gas. This water will condense after cooling and then turn back into ammonia water. In a low-pressure vaporizer, it is mixed with hydrogen and rapidly vaporized, at which time it takes away heat from the surroundings, thus cooling the air inside the box to below minus ten degrees. Electric ice boxes use an engine-driven piston to compress and liquefy sulfuric gas and lower it into the water tank pipe, suddenly turning it into a gas and cooling the surrounding air. If sulfuric gas is not used, ammonia, gas, and chloride Merille can be used instead. As for ice-placement ice boxes, the internal structure is very simple, roughly divided into several types. For the elaborate type, the middle of the outer layer and the inner layer is filled with cork shavings. The inner layer is either lined with ceramic tiles, or for second-class goods, the ceramic tiles and cork shavings are omitted. The inner layer only uses galvanized iron, and the space between the galvanized iron and the outer wooden board is filled with asbestos, charcoal, coal ash, sawdust, chaff, etc. This kind of device is quite imperfect, not only does it easily dissolve ice cubes, but microorganisms also easily breed. The ice boxes sold by the wood shops in Beijing Road, Hongmiao Alley, Xiafei Road, etc., in this port are generally of crude device! Not durable. However, no matter what kind of ice box, if it is not used properly, it will reduce the cooling efficiency and make it difficult to ensure the spoilage of food. Now I will introduce the secrets to using an ice box: (1) Opening and closing the box door. After placing ice in the box, the air inside gradually cools. If the box door is opened, the cold air inside is released, and the hot air outside flows in, the temperature inside the box will rise. Like using a stove in winter, once the door is opened, the hot air inside flows out, and the cold air outside invades, reducing the temperature in the room, so food should be taken and placed very quickly. (2) The amount of ice used should be constant. The amount of ice needed every day must be weighed according to the size of the ice box. For example, for an ordinary ice box that is three feet high, two feet wide, and one foot three or four inches deep, the amount of ice used every day must be around fifteen pounds. If it is too economical, food will inevitably spoil. Many people wrap ice in towels, thinking it can save ice, but it cannot maintain the original low temperature. (3) The inside of the ice box should always be clean. The ice box is originally used for storing food and drink, so it should be clean and dry. Because the inside of the box is dry, the cold air can strongly sense and come into contact with the food. Also, the inside should be washed with boiling water every month, or scrubbed with soapy salt water, so that the parts of the library that are stained with fatty foods can also be removed. (4) If there is water from melting ice left in the ice box, it should be drained and scrubbed clean every day, because this water is very unhygienic and will reduce the cold air. The water leakage holes should also be communicated with bamboo poles or iron wires to avoid the accumulation of dirt and bacteria in them. (5) The temperature standard inside an ordinary ice box (calculated according to the above-mentioned ice usage) is 55 degrees, but it also differs depending on the storage items, and there are also those that are as low as 50 degrees to 45 degrees. However, insects and bacteria will not die at this temperature, so it is necessary to prevent insects from invading and spreading. The preventive measure is to sprinkle carbonic acid or disinfectant on the legs of the box. (6) The ice box must be placed in a cool place. It should not be placed in the kitchen near the stove. (7) The ice sent from the ice factory is not clean. It should be washed with cold soda, wiped dry, and then wrapped in white newspaper before being placed in it, so that it can maintain the time for a longer period. (8) Dirty utensils and food must not be put into the box. For example, raw vegetables and fruits that have not been cleaned may carry microorganisms. (9) Natural ice is often unclean, so artificial ice (machine ice) should be used. (10) Frozen soda, fruits, and other refreshing drinks should never be placed in oily dishes. (11) The grooves on both sides of the layered ice box (with two or three layers) should not be used for placing things, because if their cavities are blocked by objects, the cold air cannot penetrate to the bottom. (12) Be careful to keep the drain outlet at the bottom of the box free of accumulated dirt. (13) In general, raw fish, meat, and vegetables should be washed clean with salt water before being stored in the box. (14) Warm items: should be placed on the bottom layer, and should not be close to ice blocks. The above fifteen items are the secrets to using an ice box. Please pay attention to them one by one when preparing to use one.</p>

<h3>Sending Off This Year's Students Going Abroad</h3>
<p>— Bi</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, more than thirty organizations in this city held a farewell party for this year's students going abroad at the New Asia Restaurant. According to newspaper reports the next day, we know that the three hundred-plus students going abroad received enthusiastic words of encouragement and exhortation from many well-wishers, and we can also imagine the warm and happy atmosphere at the meeting. It truly makes one feel boundless optimism for the future of China!</p>
<p>Among these three hundred-plus students going abroad this time, I have a friend, Mr. Chen, who is going to America to study law. In principle, I should also give my friend a farewell preface like those recorded in the newspapers. But haven't we all read those words, repeated a thousand times in the newspapers every year? Besides, he has already heard them. Wouldn't it be too redundant for me to say them again?</p>
<p>What I want to say will simply make those seeing him off feel extremely unhappy. Because the current facts are indeed too displeasing! Of course, I know that each of the students going abroad harbors a great ambition and hope in their hearts. These ambitions and hopes are just like those harbored by students who have gone abroad in the past or who have returned to China after completing their studies. However, the answers we received in the past show that those returned students did not give us any significant achievements. According to rumors, it is simply heartbreaking! Therefore, I have developed some degree of doubt about this year's students going abroad, and I have to say some unpleasant words.</p>
<p>In the past, students going abroad made a mistake, which was an error in their motivation. There is no need to avoid saying that many young people are dreaming day and night of earning a beautiful and pleasant future in this superficial and impractical society. Going abroad is also a fashionable and showy thing, so they want to seize the future they imagine and go abroad for a trip as a way to make a name for themselves. Secondly, there are also many young people who, after graduating from university, want to find a job in this chaotic society but cannot find a foothold. So studying abroad is their only way to transition into reality. Anyway, the young masters have plenty of money, so why not go abroad for a trip? Of course, there are also some young people who are accustomed to enjoying themselves and who decide to enjoy themselves as much as possible in admiration of the material civilization and superior life of foreign countries. There are also many such people.</p>
<p>It's really not a pleasant thing to say that for decades, China has relied on foreigners for everything, which is naturally no exception. However, we have been sending students abroad for decades. Today, there are still not many libraries in the country with rich collections of books, and there are very few research institutes with complete equipment and the ability to focus wholeheartedly on specialized academic research. Japan, like China in the past, used to send many students abroad to study every year. Now, their enthusiasm is definitely not as fashionable and crazy as that of the Chinese. This is not to say that people are not seeking knowledge, but that they are self-sufficient! Doesn't this comparison make people feel ashamed?</p>
<p>These days are precisely when this year's students going abroad are busy preparing to set off. At this moment, I hope that these three hundred-plus promising young people with boundless hope will have a sudden realization. First, the motivation must be made correct and clear, and don't fall into the previous confusion and mistakes again. Second, everyone should have the idea that (going abroad to study is not a fashionable and showy thing). At the same time, they must firmly believe that when they return to China in the future, they will actively and truly develop this desolate motherland, which even needs to rely on foreigners for education and culture, and struggle to create a new environment.</p>
<p>This is my fervent wish for this year's students going abroad.</p>
<h3>Summer Dusk</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>A kingfisher skimmed across the water, shattering the reflection of a red glow.</p>
<p>The reeds rustled in the evening breeze. The heat had not dissipated, and a few cicadas were still chirping noisily in the trees.</p>
<p>At the corner of the pond dam, a waterwheel was set up, and a handsome young man was treading water barefoot, creaking, creaking. Leaning against the waterwheel, a willow tree bent towards the water, and a few small fish chased each other under the willow branches. A pretty village girl sat leaning against the willow tree, unconsciously picking the weeds beside her, her eyes watching the young man with a smile.</p>
<p>Birds returning to their nests flew overhead, chirping. It gradually grew late. The young man nimbly got off the waterwheel, stretched, turned around, took the village girl's hand, sat down, and dangled his feet in the water, splashing and scattering the school of fish.</p>
<p>The two looked at each other, silent, always smiling.</p>
<p>The water was calm, reflecting the faces and half-bodies of the two people. The young man put his head close to the village girl's ear and whispered something, the village girl giggled, turned her face away, and shook her head. She pulled one hand out from between the young man's fingers, tidied the hair beside her ear, lowered her head, and shyly fiddled with the corner of her clothes.</p>
<p>The young man reached out to hug the village girl's head, the village girl dodged towards the tree, and as she stretched out her foot, the water surface rippled again, and the reflection on the water disappeared again.</p>
<p>"What's that?" the village girl pointed behind the young man.</p>
<p>The young man looked back and saw nothing. The village girl broke free from his hand, stood up, and ran!</p>
<p>"You little imp, I'll skin you alive!" the young man said, realizing he had been tricked, looking at her standing a foot away.</p>
<p>The young man stood up and pretended to chase her. The village girl turned and ran, stopping on the opposite bank of the pond, giggling.</p>
<p>"Stop fooling around, taking apart the waterwheel is the real deal!" the young man said.</p>
<p>"I don't dare to come over!"</p>
<p>"I won't eat you!"</p>
<p>The village girl hesitantly walked over, her eyes fixed on the young man. She stopped by the willow tree.</p>
<p>"Come on, how can I take it apart alone?" the young man said to her as he untied the rope on the frame.</p>
<p>The village girl walked to the waterwheel, and before she knew it, both hands were held by the young man again.</p>
<p>"Haha, I won't let you run this time!"</p>
<p>It was getting darker and darker, the cicadas no longer flapped their wings, leaving behind the laughter of a young couple.</p>
<h3>Conditions for Love</h3>
<p>— Bai Xi</p>
<p>From a diary of a friend of mine, I read the following passage:</p>
<p>"The ×× Western-style clothing store delivered my custom-made suit. My heart beats fast. For my ×, I should put on the suit."</p>
<p>Although there are only a few words, we can infer what kind of woman my friend is in love with.</p>
<p>I infer that the object of my friend's love must be a woman with permed hair, drawn eyebrows, rouge applied to her cherry lips, white powder and red powder evenly mixed on both cheeks, crimson nail polish on her fingers, and a pair of bare feet in high-heeled leather shoes under a long and tight-fitting thin cheongsam.</p>
<p>Would such a modern girl hold the arm of a man in a traditional long gown?</p>
<p>In the eyes of a modern girl, a "male attendant" must have a "suit" on the outside.</p>
<p>First, men must put on a "suit" to receive the gift of love from a "modern girl."</p>
<p>A suit is the first prerequisite for love.</p>
<p>From this, we can also understand what kind of women modern women are. Women have been liberated from the feudal system</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>(Chinese women are doubly oppressed). Although the remnants of feudalism have not been completely eliminated in China, and there are still many women groaning under the remnants of feudalism, some women are fighting against the remnants of feudalism and seeking liberation, which can establish women's unique personality. But unfortunately, women who have fought out of the remnants of feudalism, upon coming into contact with this "free and easy" society, are being bound by this society in disguise and continue to be "playthings" of men, with a change of soup but not the medicine. You must know that this "suit" is made for your happiness. How can you know that this "suit" is not for another "modern girl"? Because in this society, there are indeed many, many such "modern girls"!</p>
<p>Our nation is now in a crisis-ridden situation. The prerequisite for love for "new modern girls" should be:</p>
<p>"Save our crisis-ridden nation!"</p>
<p>At the very least, I believe, this should be a "condition for love."</p>
<h3>Grandma</h3>
<p>— Bi</p>
<p>Passing by Aunt Chen's door, I finally saw her bending over and stitching red and green cloth, her back dripping wet with sweat, as busy as could be. I ran over to take a look and saw it was a short jacket made of big red silk, no more than eight or nine inches long, with traces of sweat dripping from Aunt Chen's forehead. She was sewing with extra effort.</p>
<p>People congratulated her like this: "Aunt Chen is really lucky, becoming a grandmother so quickly, about to hold a grandchild!" But she always said this: "Am I really lucky? It's not being a 'grandma' but a 'laborer.' Who wants to make children's clothes in such hot weather? Besides, my daughter doesn't treat me well, but her family is big and small, and I can't help it. I'm just putting on a show to deceive people." Even so, Aunt Chen continued to do it.</p>
<p>Was it the moment when snowflakes were flying last year? Her daughter Yingwen got married. This matter is still clearly in my memory. It was the day she got married that I took my ten-year-old younger brother to the wedding feast. When my younger brother saw the "bridal sedan" and the "small ancestral hall," he widened his dark eyes and opened his small mouth to ask me: "Sister! What is this big wooden cage for! Who is the one being snatched away wearing red clothes! Why are there so many beggars crowded in front and behind?" It turns out that in the minds of children in this modern era, they think this is a predatory, arranged marriage!</p>
<p>Yingwen had been busy with her own "wedding" for a full five years! She is now finally a mother.</p>
<p>But Aunt Chen's thin face now appears even thinner, and her arms are like firewood. Relatives feel sorry for this old woman.</p>
<p>"Really, it's just taking her old life. What else can be done? The debt of five hundred yuan, and the interest is so heavy, four cents per month!" I heard another person saying this to my mother in my mother's room. I knew that they were obviously talking about Aunt Chen again. Then, the scene from last year floated before my eyes again:</p>
<p>Aunt Chen, with a shallow, bitter smile on her withered face, told her difficulties to the moneylender, how she needed money to put on a show for her daughter, and finally borrowed five hundred yuan with a monthly interest of four cents. Now, she has become a grandmother, and also a weak, clumsy ant on a hot pot. She is in pain!</p>
<h3>Happiness in a Dream</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>Lying on the bed, deeply closing my eyes, slowing my breathing, stretching out my arms and legs, like a white fish placed on a kitchen counter, its life will soon be slaughtered!</p>
<p>Concentrating all my thoughts on my mind, I have a doubtful and emotional question about my future:</p>
<p>Finally, after excessive fear and sorrow, my body suddenly trembled; my face turned pale, my heart beat rapidly, and my breathing was so tight.</p>
<p>Recalling the past may comfort my momentary pain, but is this momentary comfort not very short-lived for a person with scars all over their body?</p>
<p>Longing for the happiness of the past and the sorrow that emerges at this moment is probably because I am fond of illusions.</p>
<p>Yes, the elusive past should not be missed now, but what about today? What kind of changes will today bring to my life?</p>
<p>Today?——It is so depressing, anguish corrodes my body and mind, weakness dissipates my health, poverty robs me of my happiness, loneliness forms my troubles, and the pursuit of my ideals leaves me empty-handed. My encounters have only caused me endless sadness.</p>
<p>I admit that I am a passionate person, my heart is full of the kind of excitement and burning desire, and I am not a senseless fossil to the world.</p>
<p>My ambitions are great, my ideals are high, my desires are extravagant, but how cruelly does society treat me!</p>
<p>If a person is indecisive, lacks the habit of hard work, lacks a persevering spirit, and lacks a goal in life, is it not easy to be overcome by an adverse environment?</p>
<p>Am I one of them? Me——Can I overcome the environment? Should I fight the environment? Am I willing to fall?</p>
<p>A string of questions continuously emerged in my mind.</p>
<p>Thinking of these, I seemed to feel very embarrassed, and my eyes unknowingly moistened.</p>
<h3>Ah Da Eats Ice Cream, Ah Er Cries of Stomachache</h3>
<p>Quietly and tightly closing my eyes again, I tried to overcome the turmoil in my heart and stopped all the terrible thoughts. I must have a good sleep!</p>
<p>In my dream, I hallucinated many things that surprised me, as if I myself was fighting with some demons. In the heroic resistance, I was repeatedly attacked, frustrated, tempted, threatened, and deceived by those demons... However, I did not compromise with them, and I was not defeated by them. In a scene of scorched heads and bloody bodies, I finally relied on my unyielding spirit to repel my enemies. Then, among countless people, I was guided and assisted by them, and I triumphantly returned to my free hometown, the land of light. I am very grateful for my good fortune, and filled with hope and enthusiasm, I shouted to my friends:</p>
<p>"I have overcome my enemies!"</p>
<p>"I have gained precious freedom!"</p>
<p>Awakened by my own loud shout, I opened my tired eyes and lay still on my bed, unconsciously saying: "This is happiness in a dream!"</p>
<h3>Guangyu Mountain Hall</h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>For coolness and economy, my friend Shan and I moved to the countryside to live. We happily eat and read every day. Whenever the sun sets and after we have eaten dinner, the two of us go to Guangyu Mountain Hall near our residence for a walk. Before we know it, this small public cemetery has become our daily park. Here, we talk about life, talk about love, talk about how to write articles, how to...</p>
<p>One evening at sunset, with a cool breeze blowing, we had eaten dinner, hummed the tune of "Fisherman's Light Song" in a low voice, and walked into this small garden. We passed through a corridor made of wisteria, with green lawns on both sides. On a thin layer of green grass, stood tombstones made of marble, some large and some small, some square and some round. On the white marble head of the tomb, one or two yellow or red fresh flowers were picked. At the top of the tombstone, branches of violets hung down, swaying in the wind, and small birds stood on the branches, playing softly with the lonely spirits.</p>
<p>It was a desolate, silent mood. I sat on a tombstone, meditating on the freedom of death, the happiness of death. If I died, I could also be buried in this refreshing garden, I want to die, I want to die immediately, and go with this refreshing soul.</p>
<p>Death, where is the pain, look at the little angel with wings, isn't he happy and eager to fly? There is simply no terror here, it is simply a beautiful and lovely, refreshing and poetic small garden.</p>
<p>Shan didn't say a word, as if he was also meditating on something, the two of us were silent to each other.</p>
<p>"If my lover died and was buried here, then I would come here every day to offer her a fresh flower that she usually likes."</p>
<p>In the end, this silence was broken by Shan.</p>
<p>"Then you can just choose the tomb of a girl you love who has not yet married to be the tomb of your lover!"</p>
<p>I teased him.</p>
<p>"Don't you think this one is good? Her name is Li Xuefang, and her age is only twenty years old!"</p>
<p>"Ah, she was twenty years old when she died, and she should be twenty-two this year. You are one year younger than her, so call her sister!"</p>
<p>We both felt a special mood and smiled knowingly. He really stood next to the tomb, bowed respectfully, shouted "Sister Fang" in his mouth, and lay down on the tombstone and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Alas, life is like acting, this is not false at all, in this situation, both of us burst into tears.</p>
<p>The sky slowly darkened, a pale light rose from the east, and the twinkling stars dotted this mysterious, desolate and lonely night scene. We walked out of this quiet place with a melancholy mood, and embarked on our way home.</p>

<p>Notice: Since this journal published the debate between Mr. Jiawei and Mr. Along on mass literature, Mr. Jiawei submitted another article yesterday refuting Mr. Along's writing, but it is getting further and further away from the topic. If this kind of "hammer-style" debate continues, it will inevitably have no end. Furthermore, some other gentlemen who advocate mass literature also want to join the battle group to fight together. If more and more warriors are gathered and the scope is expanded, this journal has limited space and is really unable to cope with it.

<h3>Simpleton (7)</h3>
<p>— Lin Bin</p>
<p>(Heavens, isn't Miss Xiufeng my second cousin?) I thought to myself.</p>
<p>(But she is a bit too fierce. A beating with bamboo twigs would have been enough. Why use a red firewood stick? After all, he is a simpleton!) It was again an almost inaudible voice.</p>
<p>(You speak well. Three generations of calligraphers! Is that acceptable? Kill one to warn a hundred!)</p>
<p>(Haha, three generations of calligraphers!) This faint smile with a hint of sarcasm unconsciously reminded me of my cousin's scandalous case of raping a young widow a year ago.</p>
<p>(The master must end his life. Miss Xiufeng's mother tried to persuade him in every way possible, but she couldn't move him, so she had to lie in bed chanting Amitabha.) A woman who looked like a sister-in-law spoke with a sigh.</p>
<p>The red firewood stick continued to be drawn. The simpleton's miserable cries gradually weakened. The blurred teary eyes that could not distinguish between the whites and pupils gradually and weakly shrunk together. An ominous premonition ran through my mind. I knew that the simpleton had stepped into the edge of another world. At this time, my pity suddenly turned into resentment. A raging fire burned in my chest, and a cold tremor flowed down my spine. I didn't want to meet my uncle.</p>
<p>Dragging my heavy steps, I hurried out of the dense crowd, down the stone steps of the gate, and suddenly heard a sudden uproar from behind, telling me that death had taken away the trampled soul of the simpleton.</p>
<p>My heavy legs were inexplicably sore, and my chest felt like it was pressed down by heavy stones, suffocating so much that I couldn't breathe. A burst of chaotic thoughts flashed like lightning across my dizzy mind, stopping my whole heart from beating. Second cousin, pinching breasts... my cousin's scandalous behavior... the pockmarked nun in Jixiang Nunnery... three stones and five rents of grain, living with someone else's wife, Zhang Xingshan... the red firewood stick, the bloody half-naked corpse...

<h3>The Only Actor in Hollywood with a Knighthood</h3>
<p>— Literary Film</p>
<p>Guy Standing Meets the King of England by Chance One Night, Wishes to Spend His Remaining Years in the Film Industry Wandering the World</p>
<p>This is the only actor in Hollywood with the title of "Sir" attached to his name, but he is definitely not the George Arliss we are familiar with. George's knighthood has been rumored for a long time, but it has not yet become a reality. The current "Sir" is an Englishman named Guy Standing. Among the many actors in Hollywood, they can also be proud of having such a nobleman.</p>
<p>Sir Guy Standing's father was Herbert Standing. He was also a very famous actor on screen in the silent film era. Guy left home at the age of fifteen to seek his own life. He joined a small theater troupe in London with a salary of one pound per week. Although his contract was only for six weeks, he had already decided on his future... he was determined to become an actor. Later, he had no work for a long time, and was extremely bored, so he joined the navy and became a sailor for four years. It was a time of peace, and he could go ashore or disembark at will. Therefore, in the following four years, he went ashore when there was a play to perform, and went back to the ship when there was no play. At the age of nineteen, his theatrical life officially began. He traveled to Australia and the Americas. The plays he performed seemed like an encyclopedia of drama, truly encompassing everything. In 1914, he signed a contract with Paramount Pictures to play the lead role in "The Silver King," but a few days later, the European War broke out. As a member of the British Reserve Volunteers and holding a captain's license, he felt that the time had come to be loyal and serve the country. So he asked the company to cancel the contract. The company naturally agreed, hoping that he could return to work immediately after the war. He immediately telegraphed the British Admiralty to report his return to serve. As soon as he arrived at the London Admiralty, he was immediately appointed Deputy Commander of the British Navy and ordered to immediately depart to Portsmouth as captain of a submarine destroyer. From the moment he set foot on British soil to the moment he boarded the ship to command, it was only twelve hours.</p>
<p>Soon, Guy Standing was injured, and his kneecap was shattered. But he was unwilling to retire and live idly, so he joined the Naval Intelligence Agency. One night, he took a destroyer across the English Channel. In the darkness, he encountered a suspicious person. That night, the wind howled, and the waves surged, making the situation very dangerous. Guy saw the suspicious person walking towards the captain's office at the bow of the ship. Suspecting that he was a spy, he stepped forward, grabbed him, and pulled off his mask, which gave him a great shock. It turned out that the person was none other than King George V of England. This king, because he was a naval officer in his youth, now had not lost his ambition. Taking advantage of the dark night, he secretly disguised himself and boarded the ship to investigate the situation at sea. But the King admired Standing's bravery very much. So they talked about the maritime situation on the bow of the ship like old friends. Standing answered fluently, which made the King even more pleased. Later, the King returned to London, and eight months before the end of the war, he awarded Guy Standing the title of Commander of the British Empire. When the war ended, the King, remembering the old days, awarded him the knighthood of the British Empire. So his name suddenly had a "Sir" added to it.</p>
<p>After the war ended, he had already made a name for himself, so he wandered the world in his spare time. He was originally an actor, and now he returned to his old profession. Moreover, he had an agreement with Paramount Pictures, so he slowly came to Hollywood. He did not value his title and was willing to join the American film industry as an actor. He has now lived in Hollywood for a year and a half and hopes to spend his remaining years in this country. He has starred in eight or nine films in succession, mostly playing military officers. He has a unique majesty that ordinary actors cannot express when playing military officers because he has personally led thousands of soldiers to compete at sea, so he has a unique perspective. Of course, he is not an ordinary actor.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>"(Song of the Fishermen)" and "(Twin Sisters)"</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>I have never liked watching movies, especially those imported "scandals" and the like; to be honest, I have never had a good impression of movies. But recently, after watching "Twin Sisters" and "Song of the Fishermen," I was truly amazed: the previously vulgar and distorted Chinese movies have suddenly taken such a grand path. I think this is naturally due to the driving force of the environment.</p>
<p>These two films are both masterpieces of this year's film industry and are equally popular with the audience, which is indeed a good phenomenon. We don't need to pay too much attention to the scenery and acting skills, etc. Just talking about the consciousness of these two films is far better than most imported films; moreover, the scenery and acting aspects of these two films have not seen the slightest naivety. I think if we have such perfect films, and our compatriots still favor imported bare legs and crazy kisses, then China is really hopeless.</p>
<p>"Song of the Fishermen" and "Twin Sisters" each have their own strengths and weaknesses. In terms of acting skills, "Song of the Fishermen" should be inferior to "Twin Sisters." The director's technique is, of course, extraordinary, and the actors are all competent and hardworking, performing very delicately. The final cheerful and relaxed dialogue (that is, when Erbao recognizes Dabao as her sister) is especially a major reason for the enduring popularity of "Twin Sisters."</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, the novel subject matter, tortuous and tragic plot, and great consciousness of "Song of the Fishermen" surpass "Twin Sisters."</p>
<p>In short, these two films are a pair of twin sisters. If we must distinguish their differences, then "(Twin Sisters)" is delicate and meticulous, while "(Song of the Fishermen)" is melancholy and tragic, and that's all.</p>
<h3>Douglas Fairbanks Besieged on Both Sides</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Douglas Fairbanks can be regarded as the most unfortunate person. He has been legally harassed in both England and the United States. It can be said that he is besieged on both sides and unable to cope. His divorce case with Mary Pickford has been shelved for a long time, and now Mary is proceeding with it rapidly. Mary has petitioned the court and obtained the court's permission to publish the summons to Douglas in the newspaper because he is in England and there is no way to send the police to deliver it. In England, Douglas has successfully completed the production of "(The Private Life of Don Juan)." He then had to begin his defense work for a long-shelved adultery case. He was accused by a British nobleman, Lord Ashley, of Fairbanks having an affair with his wife. Lady Ashley was originally a singer before she married. Since Fairbanks arrived in England, she has been fond of him, almost inseparable, following him closely. It is said that even now, Fairbanks and that Lady are still traveling and resting together. Anyone who invites Fairbanks must also invite that Lady. From this alone, we can see the closeness of their relationship.</p>

<h3>Praises "(Song of the Fishermen)"</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>The French-language newspaper in this city published on August 8 a conversation that Mr. de War, a famous French novelist and playwright living in Shanghai, had with the newspaper's reporter about "(Song of the Fishermen)." Mr. de War praised the film extremely highly. He said, "(This film is truly exquisite. I have never seen such a good film. Please believe me. I deeply understand famous films from France, America, Germany, and Russia. But I feel that no European or American film is as poetic and great as (Song of the Fishermen). This is truly an extraordinary achievement. The film lasted for two hours, and not a minute failed to arouse my deep interest. Everything about it is beautiful, even the songs themselves are of excellent quality." Western newspapers have always been cautious in expressing opinions or criticisms of domestic films. This cannot be regarded as a glory for the Chinese film industry.</p>
<h3>Qian Huafu Almost Reaches Nirvana</h3>
<p>— Huanwei</p>
<p>Qian Huafu, the male lead in the sound film "(Spring Night Serenade)," was quite famous in the New Drama world twenty years ago. Later, he abandoned the stage life and specialized in painting Buddhas, gaining fame in the art world. Now he is an old man over half a century old. But it is his first time on the silver screen. He plays a pedantic elementary school principal in the play who comes to Shanghai from the countryside to receive 3,000 yuan in funding from the Education Bureau. Unfortunately, he is bewitched by a charming dancer, who steals the 3,000 yuan. This anxiety not only makes one Buddha come into being, but it is simply about to make two Buddhas reach Nirvana.</p>
<h3>"(A Myriad of Flowers)" on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>"(A Myriad of Flowers)," which was performed for a long time at the Carlton and caused a sensation throughout Shanghai by the world-famous Marx dance troupe, has jumped from the stage to the silver screen under the production of the Tianyi Film Company. Under the control of a flexible lens, the jumping legs, the extraordinary dance skills, the charming music, the magnificent and beautiful scenery, the melodious and pleasant songs, everything about "(A Myriad of Flowers)," which encompasses everything and is full of flowers, is contributed to the audience more clearly, more beautifully, and more vividly. At the same time, the photography and sound recording are also particularly perfect. Tell the people who are looking forward to seeing the film "(A Myriad of Flowers)" that "(A Myriad of Flowers)" will soon be released in Shanghai. Please pay attention to the location and time!</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Little Baby (Baby Take A Bow) (3)</h3>
<p>— Caoshi</p>
<p>Last night he had been watching Kay ice the birthday cake, had put his arms around her chest, and had stolen her spoon to stir the flour. Her head had nestled against his shoulder, her face smiling up at him. "(Happy?)" she had asked. "(Worried, with three heavy burdens on my shoulders - wife, child, and a new job,)" he had said. "(That's really too hard on you!)" Kay had answered teasingly and gently. "(The job is not bad)," Eddie had admitted. Suddenly he had said very seriously, "(Soon we can live in the country house of our dreams.)"</p>
<p>That was only yesterday. Only one night had passed, and the vision of the country cottage had been destroyed. Everything was so unexpected! When Stone came, Shirley was sitting on the front steps. The villain stared at the child and asked, "(Are you Eddie's child?)" "(I'm not a child, I'm a little girl. It's my birthday today, too,)" Shirley replied innocently. At this time, Eddie came out and immediately sent Shirley away. He looked coldly at the rascal. Stone told Eddie that he had just made a big deal, but he was too conspicuous and could not dispose of the stolen goods. He wanted Eddie to be an intermediary to keep it for him. Eddie refused sternly.</p>
<p>After Stone left, Eddie had put the matter out of his mind. He and Laurel drove to the Carson's house. But when they got there, they found that Welsh and Flannigan were also there. Terror gripped Eddie's heart. Apparently, something had happened. Soon, Eddie knew that the deal Stone had mentioned was done at the Carson's house, and the company had offered a reward of 5,000 yuan, which Welsh was pursuing. What happened next was indeed very heartbreaking. Flannigan remained silent, Carson's attitude was very stern, and Welsh was victorious. Carson asked sternly, "(Why didn't you tell me sooner that you had been in jail?)" Eddie's face was pale. "(I'll tell you, Mr. Carson. If we had told our employer, we wouldn't have been able to find business! We have learned from so many experiences that we decided not to say it. But we have reformed and are good people now, aren't we?)" But what was the use of explaining? They were still unemployed! And Welsh was watching them closely, eager to catch them in the act, thinking that he would definitely be able to catch them with the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Eddie forced himself to sort out his thoughts and return to the present situation. The candlelight flickered and went out, and the knife cut through the thick birthday cake. The after-party began on the roof, and Eddie came out. "(Ladies and gentlemen. We have spared no expense to invite Miss Shirley to perform for the first time on this roof.)" Amidst enthusiastic applause, he turned around and waved a beautiful and graceful little figure out, Shirley in a fluffy dress. Shirley then bowed to the crowd and began to sing. Eddie sang along. After a while, her little feet started to dance, and he followed, but he couldn't keep up with her because Shirley had already learned some exquisite steps. When she finished dancing, there was a burst of applause. Eddie said proudly, "(Good, Bảo Bảo, take a bow.——)" The guests, children, and adults dispersed. It was indeed a great and fulfilling gathering. Keane and Laurel stood with the host couple to see the guests off. At this time, the radio broadcasting the music for Shirley's dance was still on. Eddie was almost oblivious to the looming storm in his pride.</p>
<p>The radio's clear reporter's voice broke through the silence. "(The case of the theft of a pearl necklace worth 50,000 yuan from Mr. Carson's residence on Fifth Avenue last night has caused the police to move out in force, hoping to solve the case as soon as possible. The police authorities believe that the theft was committed by someone inside the house.)"</p>
<p>Kay's hand gripped Shirley's wrist convulsively. "(Darling, come on, it's time to sleep now,)" Laurel whispered beside her, "(Things seem to be going bad,)" Eddie nodded, biting his lip and saying, "(I'm afraid we're going to suffer this time.)" (To be continued)</p>
